### [1] [Improving Noise Robust Audio-Visual Speech Recognition via Router-Gated Cross-Modal Feature Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18734)
*DongHoon Lim,YoungChae Kim,Dong-Hyun Kim,Da-Hee Yang,Joon-Hyuk Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于路由器门控的跨模态特征融合方法，用于噪声环境下的鲁棒视听语音识别，通过动态调整音频和视觉特征的权重来提升识别性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统在噪声环境中难以准确估计音频可靠性并动态调整模态依赖，导致视听语音识别性能下降

Method: 使用音频-视觉特征融合的路由器，基于token级声学损坏分数自适应地重新加权音频和视觉特征，通过门控交叉注意力在解码器层中加强视觉线索

Result: 在LRS3数据集上相比AV-HuBERT实现了16.51-42.67%的相对词错误率降低

Conclusion: 路由器机制和门控机制共同提升了模型在真实世界声学噪声下的鲁棒性

Abstract: Robust audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) in noisy environments remains
challenging, as existing systems struggle to estimate audio reliability and
dynamically adjust modality reliance. We propose router-gated cross-modal
feature fusion, a novel AVSR framework that adaptively reweights audio and
visual features based on token-level acoustic corruption scores. Using an
audio-visual feature fusion-based router, our method down-weights unreliable
audio tokens and reinforces visual cues through gated cross-attention in each
decoder layer. This enables the model to pivot toward the visual modality when
audio quality deteriorates. Experiments on LRS3 demonstrate that our approach
achieves an 16.51-42.67% relative reduction in word error rate compared to
AV-HuBERT. Ablation studies confirm that both the router and gating mechanism
contribute to improved robustness under real-world acoustic noise.

TL;DR: 海底三维物体检测面临数据稀缺挑战，本文提出两种无需真实训练数据的检测方法：基于合成数据的神经网络和模板匹配方法，发现模板匹配在真实地理环境中更为稳健


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海底三维物体检测面临真实训练数据获取困难、成本高、逻辑复杂等挑战，需要找到不依赖大量标注数据的可靠检测方法

Method: 开发了两种方法：1）基于物理模拟的声纳模拟管道，生成合成训练数据训练最新神经网络；2）基于几何先验知识的模型基于模板匹配系统

Result: 神经网络在合成数据上达到98% mAP，但在真实数据上下降到40% mAP；模板匹配方法在真实数据上保持83% mAP，且不需要任何训练

Conclusion: 模板匹配方法在海底环境中显示出更好的稳健性和适应性，挐成了深度学习需要大量数据的传统观念，为数据稀缺环境下的自主潜艇导航、海洋考古等应用开启了新可能性

Abstract: Underwater 3D object detection remains one of the most challenging frontiers
in computer vision, where traditional approaches struggle with the harsh
acoustic environment and scarcity of training data. While deep learning has
revolutionized terrestrial 3D detection, its application underwater faces a
critical bottleneck: obtaining sufficient annotated sonar data is prohibitively
expensive and logistically complex, often requiring specialized vessels, expert
surveyors, and favorable weather conditions. This work addresses a fundamental
question: Can we achieve reliable underwater 3D object detection without
real-world training data? We tackle this challenge by developing and comparing
two paradigms for training-free detection of artificial structures in multibeam
echo-sounder point clouds. Our dual approach combines a physics-based sonar
simulation pipeline that generates synthetic training data for state-of-the-art
neural networks, with a robust model-based template matching system that
leverages geometric priors of target objects. Evaluation on real bathymetry
surveys from the Baltic Sea reveals surprising insights: while neural networks
trained on synthetic data achieve 98% mean Average Precision (mAP) on simulated
scenes, they drop to 40% mAP on real sonar data due to domain shift.
Conversely, our template matching approach maintains 83% mAP on real data
without requiring any training, demonstrating remarkable robustness to acoustic
noise and environmental variations. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom
about data-hungry deep learning in underwater domains and establish the first
large-scale benchmark for training-free underwater 3D detection. This work
opens new possibilities for autonomous underwater vehicle navigation, marine
archaeology, and offshore infrastructure monitoring in data-scarce environments
where traditional machine learning approaches fail.

*Shudipta Banik,Muna Das,Trapa Banik,Md. Ehsanul Haque*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MobileDenseAttn是一个融合MobileNetV2和DenseNet201的双流模型，用于脑瘤MRI检测，在6020个MRI扫描数据集上达到98.35%的测试准确率，比基线模型提升3.67%准确率并减少39.3%训练时间，同时通过GradCAM提供可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前脑瘤MRI检测方法存在局限性：泛化能力差、计算效率低、缺乏可解释性和透明度，限制了临床可信度。需要开发一种既能提高检测精度又能提供可视化解释的通用模型。

Method: 提出MobileDenseAttn融合模型，结合MobileNetV2和DenseNet201的双流架构，采用特征级融合方法。在包含胶质瘤、脑膜瘤、垂体瘤和正常样本的6020个MRI扫描增强数据集上进行训练，使用5折交叉验证协议。

Result: 模型训练准确率99.75%，测试准确率98.35%，F1分数0.9835（95%置信区间0.9743-0.9920）。相比基线模型VGG19，准确率提升3.67%，训练时间减少39.3%。GradCAM热图清晰显示肿瘤区域。

Conclusion: MobileDenseAttn是一个高效、高性能、可解释的模型，具有成为临床实用工具的潜力，能够为脑瘤检测提供准确的诊断和可视化解释。

Abstract: The detection of brain tumor in MRI is an important aspect of ensuring timely
diagnostics and treatment; however, manual analysis is commonly long and
error-prone. Current approaches are not universal because they have limited
generalization to heterogeneous tumors, are computationally inefficient, are
not interpretable, and lack transparency, thus limiting trustworthiness. To
overcome these issues, we introduce MobileDenseAttn, a fusion model of dual
streams of MobileNetV2 and DenseNet201 that can help gradually improve the
feature representation scale, computing efficiency, and visual explanations via
GradCAM. Our model uses feature level fusion and is trained on an augmented
dataset of 6,020 MRI scans representing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors,
and normal samples. Measured under strict 5-fold cross-validation protocols,
MobileDenseAttn provides a training accuracy of 99.75%, a testing accuracy of
98.35%, and a stable F1 score of 0.9835 (95% CI: 0.9743 to 0.9920). The
extensive validation shows the stability of the model, and the comparative
analysis proves that it is a great advancement over the baseline models (VGG19,
DenseNet201, MobileNetV2) with a +3.67% accuracy increase and a 39.3% decrease
in training time compared to VGG19. The GradCAM heatmaps clearly show
tumor-affected areas, offering clinically significant localization and
improving interpretability. These findings position MobileDenseAttn as an
efficient, high performance, interpretable model with a high probability of
becoming a clinically practical tool in identifying brain tumors in the real
world.

### [4] [Can VLMs Recall Factual Associations From Visual References?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18297)
*Dhananjay Ashok,Ashutosh Chaubey,Hirona J. Arai,Jonathan May,Jesse Thomason*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉语言模型在视觉实体引用时的知识回忆能力显著低于文本引用，存在多模态基础的系统性缺陷，可通过内部状态探针检测模型不可靠响应


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别视觉语言模型在多模态基础方面的系统性缺陷，特别是当实体引用从文本变为视觉时模型知识回忆能力的下降问题

Method: 通过控制研究比较文本和视觉引用下的知识回忆能力，分析模型内部状态模式，开发内部状态探针来检测不可靠响应

Result: 视觉引用使事实知识回忆能力减半，内部状态探针检测不可靠响应的准确率超过92%，在视觉问答任务中覆盖度提高7.87%同时降低错误风险0.9%

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型在连接内部知识与图像表示方面存在系统性可检测的缺陷，需要改进多模态基础能力，内部状态探针可作为有效的可靠性检测工具

Abstract: Through a controlled study, we identify a systematic deficiency in the
multimodal grounding of Vision Language Models (VLMs). While VLMs can recall
factual associations when provided a textual reference to an entity; their
ability to do so is significantly diminished when the reference is visual
instead. Forcing VLMs to rely on image representations of an entity halves
their ability to recall factual knowledge, suggesting that VLMs struggle to
link their internal knowledge of an entity with its image representation. We
show that such linking failures are correlated with the expression of distinct
patterns in model internal states, and that probes on these internal states
achieve over 92% accuracy at flagging cases where the VLM response is
unreliable. These probes can be applied, without retraining, to identify when a
VLM will fail to correctly answer a question that requires an understanding of
multimodal input. When used to facilitate selective prediction on a visual
question answering task, the probes increase coverage by 7.87% (absolute) while
also reducing the risk of error by 0.9% (absolute). Addressing the systematic,
detectable deficiency is an important avenue in language grounding, and we
provide informed recommendations for future directions.

*Bo Xu,Yuhu Guo,Yuchao Wang,Wenting Wang,Yeung Yam,Charlie C. L. Wang,Xinyi Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种语义感知的神经重建方法，从稀疏图像生成高保真3D模型，通过添加基于patch的语义logits来丰富神经隐式表示，并引入基于几何基元掩码的正则化来缓解形状模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决稀疏输入中特征不匹配导致的严重辐射模糊问题，提高从稀疏图像进行3D重建的质量和准确性。

Method: 在神经隐式表示中添加patch-based语义logits，与符号距离场和辐射场联合优化；引入基于几何基元掩码的新型正则化方法来缓解形状模糊。

Result: 在DTU数据集上，相比SparseNeuS和VolRecon，平均倒角距离分别减少44%和20%；作为NeuS和Neuralangelo等密集重建基线的插件，平均误差分别减少69%和68%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了稀疏图像3D重建中的辐射模糊和形状模糊问题，显著提升了重建精度，可作为现有密集重建方法的有效补充。

Abstract: We propose a semantic-aware neural reconstruction method to generate 3D
high-fidelity models from sparse images. To tackle the challenge of severe
radiance ambiguity caused by mismatched features in sparse input, we enrich
neural implicit representations by adding patch-based semantic logits that are
optimized together with the signed distance field and the radiance field. A
novel regularization based on the geometric primitive masks is introduced to
mitigate shape ambiguity. The performance of our approach has been verified in
experimental evaluation. The average chamfer distances of our reconstruction on
the DTU dataset can be reduced by 44% for SparseNeuS and 20% for VolRecon. When
working as a plugin for those dense reconstruction baselines such as NeuS and
Neuralangelo, the average error on the DTU dataset can be reduced by 69% and
68% respectively.

TL;DR: 使用轻量级深度学习模型和集成方法在AerialWaste数据集上实现非法垃圾填埋场检测，达到92.33%的准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非法垃圾填埋场对全球构成严重威胁，手动识别困难且耗时，需要自动化检测方法来节省时间和资源

Method: 采用Mobilenetv2、Googlenet、Densenet、MobileVit等轻量级深度学习模型，避免过拟合，并通过集成融合技术结合最佳模型

Result: 集成模型在二分类任务上取得92.33%准确率、92.67%精确率、92.33%灵敏度、92.41% F1分数和92.71%特异性

Conclusion: 轻量级模型结合集成方法能有效解决非法垃圾填埋场检测问题，避免复杂模型过拟合，在AerialWaste数据集上表现优异

Abstract: Illegal landfills are posing as a hazardous threat to people all over the
world. Due to the arduous nature of manually identifying the location of
landfill, many landfills go unnoticed by authorities and later cause dangerous
harm to people and environment. Deep learning can play a significant role in
identifying these landfills while saving valuable time, manpower and resources.
Despite being a burning concern, good quality publicly released datasets for
illegal landfill detection are hard to find due to security concerns. However,
AerialWaste Dataset is a large collection of 10434 images of Lombardy region of
Italy. The images are of varying qualities, collected from three different
sources: AGEA Orthophotos, WorldView-3, and Google Earth. The dataset contains
professionally curated, diverse and high-quality images which makes it
particularly suitable for scalable and impactful research. As we trained
several models to compare results, we found complex and heavy models to be
prone to overfitting and memorizing training data instead of learning patterns.
Therefore, we chose lightweight simpler models which could leverage general
features from the dataset. In this study, Mobilenetv2, Googlenet, Densenet,
MobileVit and other lightweight deep learning models were used to train and
validate the dataset as they achieved significant success with less
overfitting. As we saw substantial improvement in the performance using some of
these models, we combined the best performing models and came up with an
ensemble model. With the help of ensemble and fusion technique, binary
classification could be performed on this dataset with 92.33% accuracy, 92.67%
precision, 92.33% sensitivity, 92.41% F1 score and 92.71% specificity.

*Jiangfeng Sun,Sihao He,Zhonghong Ou,Meina Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSU框架通过整合模态特定结构信息和跨模态语义对齐，提升多模态情感分析的性能、可解释性和鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态融合方法忽视模态特定结构依赖和语义错位问题，限制了模型质量、可解释性和鲁棒性

Method: 提出结构-语义统一器(SSU)：动态构建模态特定图（文本用语法，音视频用轻量级文本引导注意力）；引入基于全局文本语义的语义锚点作为跨模态对齐中心；开发多视图对比学习目标

Result: 在CMU-MOSI和CMU-MOSEI基准数据集上达到最先进性能，同时显著降低计算开销

Conclusion: SSU框架能有效捕获细粒度情感模式，通过语义基础交互提升多模态情感分析的性能和可解释性

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to infer emotional states by
effectively integrating textual, acoustic, and visual modalities. Despite
notable progress, existing multimodal fusion methods often neglect
modality-specific structural dependencies and semantic misalignment, limiting
their quality, interpretability, and robustness. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel framework called the Structural-Semantic Unifier (SSU),
which systematically integrates modality-specific structural information and
cross-modal semantic grounding for enhanced multimodal representations.
Specifically, SSU dynamically constructs modality-specific graphs by leveraging
linguistic syntax for text and a lightweight, text-guided attention mechanism
for acoustic and visual modalities, thus capturing detailed intra-modal
relationships and semantic interactions. We further introduce a semantic
anchor, derived from global textual semantics, that serves as a cross-modal
alignment hub, effectively harmonizing heterogeneous semantic spaces across
modalities. Additionally, we develop a multiview contrastive learning objective
that promotes discriminability, semantic consistency, and structural coherence
across intra- and inter-modal views. Extensive evaluations on two widely used
benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, demonstrate that SSU consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing
computational overhead compared to prior methods. Comprehensive qualitative
analyses further validate SSU's interpretability and its ability to capture
nuanced emotional patterns through semantically grounded interactions.

### [8] [FastAvatar: Instant 3D Gaussian Splatting for Faces from Single Unconstrained Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18389)
*Hao Liang,Zhixuan Ge,Ashish Tiwari,Soumendu Majee,G. M. Dilshan Godaliyadda,Ashok Veeraraghavan,Guha Balakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastAvatar是一个基于3D高斯泼溅的快速单图像人脸重建框架，能够在10毫秒内从任意姿态的单张人脸图像生成高质量的3D模型，支持实时身份插值和属性编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3DGS人脸生成方法要么需要每张人脸单独优化（速度慢），要么前馈方法重建质量不足。需要一种既能保持高质量重建又能实现快速推理的解决方案。

Method: 使用编码器-解码器神经网络设计，首先从多视角人脸数据集构建3DGS模板模型，然后将输入图像编码为身份特定且姿态不变的潜在嵌入，解码后预测模板高斯模型的结构和外观参数残差。

Result: 在重建质量上显著优于现有前馈方法（如GAGAvatar），比逐人脸优化方法快1000倍，支持实时身份插值和属性编辑。

Conclusion: FastAvatar通过结合优秀的重建质量和极快的速度，扩展了3DGS在消费级和交互式系统中用于照片级真实感头像应用的范围。

Abstract: We present FastAvatar, a pose-invariant, feed-forward framework that can
generate a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from a single face image from an
arbitrary pose in near-instant time (<10ms). FastAvatar uses a novel
encoder-decoder neural network design to achieve both fast fitting and identity
preservation regardless of input pose. First, FastAvatar constructs a 3DGS face
``template'' model from a training dataset of faces with multi-view captures.
Second, FastAvatar encodes the input face image into an identity-specific and
pose-invariant latent embedding, and decodes this embedding to predict
residuals to the structural and appearance parameters of each Gaussian in the
template 3DGS model. By only inferring residuals in a feed-forward fashion,
model inference is fast and robust. FastAvatar significantly outperforms
existing feed-forward face 3DGS methods (e.g., GAGAvatar) in reconstruction
quality, and runs 1000x faster than per-face optimization methods (e.g.,
FlashAvatar, GaussianAvatars and GASP). In addition, FastAvatar's novel latent
space design supports real-time identity interpolation and attribute editing
which is not possible with any existing feed-forward 3DGS face generation
framework. FastAvatar's combination of excellent reconstruction quality and
speed expands the scope of 3DGS for photorealistic avatar applications in
consumer and interactive systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在紧急人道主义场景中使用生物识别技术可以提高效率，但存在数据安全风险，特别是在脆弱环境中需要保护数据主体的隐私和安全。

Method: 通过制定功能、操作和安全隐私要求，比较分析生物特征模板保护方案，选择PolyProtect方法应用于神经网络人脸嵌入，并使用EdgeFace特征提取器在真实数据集上进行评估。

Result: 实验结果表明PolyProtect在验证和识别准确性、不可逆性和不可链接性方面表现良好，并且首次在指纹生物识别中验证了其跨模态适用性。

Conclusion: PolyProtect是一种有效、模块化且计算轻量的生物特征模板保护方案，适用于人道主义紧急场景，具有跨模态应用潜力，代码将公开发布。

Abstract: In humanitarian and emergency scenarios, the use of biometrics can
dramatically improve the efficiency of operations, but it poses risks for the
data subjects, which are exacerbated in contexts of vulnerability. To address
this, we present a mobile biometric system implementing a biometric template
protection (BTP) scheme suitable for these scenarios. After rigorously
formulating the functional, operational, and security and privacy requirements
of these contexts, we perform a broad comparative analysis of the BTP
landscape. PolyProtect, a method designed to operate on neural network face
embeddings, is identified as the most suitable method due to its effectiveness,
modularity, and lightweight computational burden. We evaluate PolyProtect in
terms of verification and identification accuracy, irreversibility, and
unlinkability, when this BTP method is applied to face embeddings extracted
using EdgeFace, a novel state-of-the-art efficient feature extractor, on a
real-world face dataset from a humanitarian field project in Ethiopia.
Moreover, as PolyProtect promises to be modality-independent, we extend its
evaluation to fingerprints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
time that PolyProtect has been evaluated for the identification scenario and
for fingerprint biometrics. Our experimental results are promising, and we plan
to release our code

TL;DR: 视觉基础模型缺乏显式关系推理能力，提出通过动态关系图接口增强模型的方案，在多个领域证明了收益


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉基础模型虽然在表征学习方面表现优异，但在需要显式推理实体、角色和空间-时间关系的任务上存在显著局限性

Method: 提出在基础模型中集成动态关系图接口，构建轻量级、上下文适配的图推理模块，图的拓扑结构和边语义根据输入和任务上下文推断

Result: 在人类操作动作识别和脑结果剪分等领域证明，增强基础模型能够提高细粒度语义保真性、外部分布稳健性、可解释性和计算效率，同时保持良好的内存和硬件效率

Conclusion: 提出了基础模型图混合结构的研究议程，优先考虑学习动态图构建、多级关系推理、跨模态融合以及直接探测结构化视觉任务中关系能力的评估协议

Abstract: Vision foundation models (FMs) have become the predominant architecture in
computer vision, providing highly transferable representations learned from
large-scale, multimodal corpora. Nonetheless, they exhibit persistent
limitations on tasks that require explicit reasoning over entities, roles, and
spatio-temporal relations. Such relational competence is indispensable for
fine-grained human activity recognition, egocentric video understanding, and
multimodal medical image analysis, where spatial, temporal, and semantic
dependencies are decisive for performance. We advance the position that
next-generation FMs should incorporate explicit relational interfaces,
instantiated as dynamic relational graphs (graphs whose topology and edge
semantics are inferred from the input and task context). We illustrate this
position with cross-domain evidence from recent systems in human manipulation
action recognition and brain tumor segmentation, showing that augmenting FMs
with lightweight, context-adaptive graph-reasoning modules improves
fine-grained semantic fidelity, out of distribution robustness,
interpretability, and computational efficiency relative to FM only baselines.
Importantly, by reasoning sparsely over semantic nodes, such hybrids also
achieve favorable memory and hardware efficiency, enabling deployment under
practical resource constraints. We conclude with a targeted research agenda for
FM graph hybrids, prioritizing learned dynamic graph construction, multi-level
relational reasoning (e.g., part object scene in activity understanding, or
region organ in medical imaging), cross-modal fusion, and evaluation protocols
that directly probe relational competence in structured vision tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决车牌识别中低质量车牌的处理问题，通过选择性图像预处理来优化模型性能和计算效率。

Method: 采用细粒度标注策略，包括车辆和车牌级别的遮挡、四个可读性类别，并使用ViT、ResNet和YOLO三种图像识别网络作为基准模型进行分类任务。

Result: 所有三个基准模型的总体F1分数均低于80%，表明该任务具有挑战性，需要进一步研究。

Conclusion: 该数据集为车牌可读性分类研究提供了重要资源，凸显了当前方法的局限性，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) faces a major challenge when
dealing with illegible license plates (LPs). While reconstruction methods such
as super-resolution (SR) have emerged, the core issue of recognizing these
low-quality LPs remains unresolved. To optimize model performance and
computational efficiency, image pre-processing should be applied selectively to
cases that require enhanced legibility. To support research in this area, we
introduce a novel dataset comprising 10,210 images of vehicles with 12,687
annotated LPs for legibility classification (the LPLC dataset). The images span
a wide range of vehicle types, lighting conditions, and camera/image quality
levels. We adopt a fine-grained annotation strategy that includes vehicle- and
LP-level occlusions, four legibility categories (perfect, good, poor, and
illegible), and character labels for three categories (excluding illegible
LPs). As a benchmark, we propose a classification task using three image
recognition networks to determine whether an LP image is good enough, requires
super-resolution, or is completely unrecoverable. The overall F1 score, which
remained below 80% for all three baseline models (ViT, ResNet, and YOLO),
together with the analyses of SR and LP recognition methods, highlights the
difficulty of the task and reinforces the need for further research. The
proposed dataset is publicly available at
https://github.com/lmlwojcik/lplc-dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在医疗任务中诊断准确性有限、模型过大导致推理成本高的问题，需要构建轻量级且可信的临床AI系统

Method: 采用专家-通用框架：专家组件（轻量级图像分类器）提供快速诊断预测，通用组件（压缩VLM）生成自然语言解释，通过知识图谱检索确保回答的准确性

Result: 在皮肤病数据集上诊断准确率提升18%，VRAM需求降低20%，延迟减少5%，优于未压缩的单线VLM基线

Conclusion: 专家-通用系统为构建轻量级、可信赖且临床可行的AI系统提供了实用而强大的范式

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant potential for medical
tasks; however, their general-purpose nature can limit specialized diagnostic
accuracy, and their large size poses substantial inference costs for real-world
clinical deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce CLARIFY, a
Specialist-Generalist framework for dermatological visual question answering
(VQA). CLARIFY combines two components: (i) a lightweight, domain-trained image
classifier (the Specialist) that provides fast and highly accurate diagnostic
predictions, and (ii) a powerful yet compressed conversational VLM (the
Generalist) that generates natural language explanations to user queries. In
our framework, the Specialist's predictions directly guide the Generalist's
reasoning, focusing it on the correct diagnostic path. This synergy is further
enhanced by a knowledge graph-based retrieval module, which grounds the
Generalist's responses in factual dermatological knowledge, ensuring both
accuracy and reliability. This hierarchical design not only reduces diagnostic
errors but also significantly improves computational efficiency. Experiments on
our curated multimodal dermatology dataset demonstrate that CLARIFY achieves an
18\% improvement in diagnostic accuracy over the strongest baseline, a
fine-tuned, uncompressed single-line VLM, while reducing the average VRAM
requirement and latency by at least 20\% and 5\%, respectively. These results
indicate that a Specialist-Generalist system provides a practical and powerful
paradigm for building lightweight, trustworthy, and clinically viable AI
systems.

Abstract: Face images play a crucial role in numerous applications; however, real-world
conditions frequently introduce degradations such as noise, blur, and
compression artifacts, affecting overall image quality and hindering subsequent
tasks. To address this challenge, we organized the VQualA 2025 Challenge on
Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) as part of the ICCV 2025 Workshops.
Participants created lightweight and efficient models (limited to 0.5 GFLOPs
and 5 million parameters) for the prediction of Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) on
face images with arbitrary resolutions and realistic degradations. Submissions
underwent comprehensive evaluations through correlation metrics on a dataset of
in-the-wild face images. This challenge attracted 127 participants, with 1519
final submissions. This report summarizes the methodologies and findings for
advancing the development of practical FIQA approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合TimeSformer、DPC和CLIP的零样本异常检测框架，通过时空建模和语义上下文理解来检测未见过的异常行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监控视频中的异常检测具有挑战性，因为异常事件不可预测且高度依赖上下文环境。传统方法需要异常样本进行训练，而零样本方法可以避免这一限制。

Method: 采用混合架构：TimeSformer作为视觉骨干提取时空特征，DPC进行未来表示预测以识别时间偏差，CLIP通过文本提示实现概念级异常检测。使用InfoNCE和CPC损失联合训练，并引入上下文门控机制增强决策。

Result: 该框架能够在不接触异常样本的情况下，有效检测复杂环境中的未见异常行为，实现了时间推理与语义上下文的结合。

Conclusion: 通过整合预测建模和视觉语言理解，该零样本异常检测框架在监控场景中展现出良好的泛化能力，为无监督异常检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in surveillance footage is inherently challenging due to
their unpredictable and context-dependent nature. This work introduces a novel
context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection framework that identifies abnormal
events without exposure to anomaly examples during training. The proposed
hybrid architecture combines TimeSformer, DPC, and CLIP to model spatiotemporal
dynamics and semantic context. TimeSformer serves as the vision backbone to
extract rich spatial-temporal features, while DPC forecasts future
representations to identify temporal deviations. Furthermore, a CLIP-based
semantic stream enables concept-level anomaly detection through
context-specific text prompts. These components are jointly trained using
InfoNCE and CPC losses, aligning visual inputs with their temporal and semantic
representations. A context-gating mechanism further enhances decision-making by
modulating predictions with scene-aware cues or global video features. By
integrating predictive modeling with vision-language understanding, the system
can generalize to previously unseen behaviors in complex environments. This
framework bridges the gap between temporal reasoning and semantic context in
zero-shot anomaly detection for surveillance. The code for this research has
been made available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DoGFlow是一种新颖的自监督框架，通过4D雷达多普勒测量实时计算运动伪标签，并将其转移到LiDAR域，无需人工标注即可实现3D场景流估计


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自监督方法在长距离和恶劣天气场景中性能不足，而监督方法依赖昂贵的人工标注难以扩展，需要开发无需人工标注的鲁棒3D场景流估计方法

Method: 采用跨模态标签转移方法，从4D雷达多普勒测量实时计算运动伪标签，通过动态感知关联和模糊解析传播将其转移到LiDAR域

Result: 在MAN TruckScenes数据集上显著优于现有自监督方法，仅需10%的标注数据即可达到全监督方法90%以上的性能

Conclusion: DoGFlow提供了一种可扩展的自监督解决方案，有效解决了3D场景流估计中的标注瓶颈问题，在自动驾驶动态环境导航中具有重要应用价值

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene flow estimation is critical for autonomous systems to
navigate dynamic environments safely, but creating the necessary large-scale,
manually annotated datasets remains a significant bottleneck for developing
robust perception models. Current self-supervised methods struggle to match the
performance of fully supervised approaches, especially in challenging
long-range and adverse weather scenarios, while supervised methods are not
scalable due to their reliance on expensive human labeling. We introduce
DoGFlow, a novel self-supervised framework that recovers full 3D object motions
for LiDAR scene flow estimation without requiring any manual ground truth
annotations. This paper presents our cross-modal label transfer approach, where
DoGFlow computes motion pseudo-labels in real-time directly from 4D radar
Doppler measurements and transfers them to the LiDAR domain using dynamic-aware
association and ambiguity-resolved propagation. On the challenging MAN
TruckScenes dataset, DoGFlow substantially outperforms existing self-supervised
methods and improves label efficiency by enabling LiDAR backbones to achieve
over 90% of fully supervised performance with only 10% of the ground truth
data. For more details, please visit https://ajinkyakhoche.github.io/DogFlow/

TL;DR: SatSkylines是一种从卫星图像和粗糙几何先验生成3D建筑的方法，通过建模从噪声粗先验到详细几何的转换，实现灵活几何控制且无需额外计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图像的3D生成方法难以从卫星图像顶部视角恢复准确建筑结构，而3D细节化方法过度依赖详细体素输入，无法从简单先验（如长方体）产生满意结果。

Method: 建模从插值噪声粗糙先验到详细几何的转换过程，开发了包含5万多个独特风格化3D建筑资产的大规模数据集Skylines-50K。

Result: 广泛评估表明该方法有效且具有强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SatSkylines成功解决了卫星图像3D建筑生成的几何准确性和细节化问题，为建筑模型生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present SatSkylines, a 3D building generation approach that takes
satellite imagery and coarse geometric priors. Without proper geometric
guidance, existing image-based 3D generation methods struggle to recover
accurate building structures from the top-down views of satellite images alone.
On the other hand, 3D detailization methods tend to rely heavily on highly
detailed voxel inputs and fail to produce satisfying results from simple priors
such as cuboids. To address these issues, our key idea is to model the
transformation from interpolated noisy coarse priors to detailed geometries,
enabling flexible geometric control without additional computational cost. We
have further developed Skylines-50K, a large-scale dataset of over 50,000
unique and stylized 3D building assets in order to support the generations of
detailed building models. Extensive evaluations indicate the effectiveness of
our model and strong generalization ability.

TL;DR: 这篇论文形式化了从单帧游戏图像中检测空间过渡点的任务，提出了两阶段深度学习流水线，并在自建数据集上进行了验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂的3D游戏环境中，快速识别地图过渡点对客户端自动地图制图和地图线索呈现评估至关重要。研究者希望为未来的AI驱动导航辅助和数据驱动的关卡设计工具奠定基础。

Method: 提出两阶段深度学习流水线：首先使用Faster R-CNN检测潜在的空间过渡点，然后用轻量级的MSTP选择器融合局部和全局视觉特征进行排名。使用参数高效的适配器，还包含可选的检索增强融合步骤。

Result: 在自建的多样化数据集上验证了方法。完整网络微调在数据充足时检测效果更好，而仅使用适配器的转移学习在少数据场景和MSTP选择任务中更加稳健和有效。

Conclusion: 这项研究定义了一个新的研究问题，提供了基准流水线和数据集，并为高效模型适配提供了初步见解，为未来的AI驱动导航辅助和数据驱动的关卡设计工具奠定了基础。

Abstract: In complex 3D game environments, players rely on visual affordances to spot
map transition points. Efficient identification of such points is important to
client-side auto-mapping, and provides an objective basis for evaluating map
cue presentation. In this work, we formalize the task of detecting traversable
Spatial Transition Points (STPs)-connectors between two sub regions-and
selecting the singular Main STP (MSTP), the unique STP that lies on the
designer-intended critical path toward the player's current macro-objective,
from a single game frame, proposing this as a new research focus. We introduce
a two-stage deep-learning pipeline that first detects potential STPs using
Faster R-CNN and then ranks them with a lightweight MSTP selector that fuses
local and global visual features. Both stages benefit from parameter-efficient
adapters, and we further introduce an optional retrieval-augmented fusion step.
Our primary goal is to establish the feasibility of this problem and set
baseline performance metrics. We validate our approach on a custom-built,
diverse dataset collected from five Action RPG titles. Our experiments reveal a
key trade-off: while full-network fine-tuning produces superior STP detection
with sufficient data, adapter-only transfer is significantly more robust and
effective in low-data scenarios and for the MSTP selection task. By defining
this novel problem, providing a baseline pipeline and dataset, and offering
initial insights into efficient model adaptation, we aim to contribute to
future AI-driven navigation aids and data-informed level-design tools.

Motivation: 当前最先进的音频驱动角色动画方法主要适用于语音和歌唱场景，但在需要复杂角色互动、细腻身体动作和动态镜头的影视制作中表现不足，需要解决实现影视级角色动画的长期挑战。

Method: 基于Wan构建音频驱动模型Wan-S2V，通过改进模型架构和训练策略来增强在电影场景中的表现能力。

Result: 在Hunyuan-Avatar和Omnihuman等先进模型的基准测试中，Wan-S2V始终显著优于现有解决方案，并在长视频生成和精确视频唇形同步编辑等应用中展现出良好的通用性。

Conclusion: Wan-S2V模型成功解决了影视级角色动画的挑战，在表达力和保真度方面实现了显著提升，为复杂影视制作提供了有效的音频驱动动画解决方案。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for audio-driven character animation
demonstrate promising performance for scenarios primarily involving speech and
singing. However, they often fall short in more complex film and television
productions, which demand sophisticated elements such as nuanced character
interactions, realistic body movements, and dynamic camera work. To address
this long-standing challenge of achieving film-level character animation, we
propose an audio-driven model, which we refere to as Wan-S2V, built upon Wan.
Our model achieves significantly enhanced expressiveness and fidelity in
cinematic contexts compared to existing approaches. We conducted extensive
experiments, benchmarking our method against cutting-edge models such as
Hunyuan-Avatar and Omnihuman. The experimental results consistently demonstrate
that our approach significantly outperforms these existing solutions.
Additionally, we explore the versatility of our method through its applications
in long-form video generation and precise video lip-sync editing.

### [19] [Decouple, Reorganize, and Fuse: A Multimodal Framework for Cancer Survival Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18632)
*Huayi Wang,Haochao Ying,Yuyang Xu,Qibo Qiu,Cheng Zhang,Danny Z. Chen,Ying Sun,Jian Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的Decoupling-Reorganization-Fusion框架(DeReF)，通过随机特征重组策略和动态MoE融合来改善多模态癌症生存分析中的特征融合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态融合方法存在两个主要问题：固定融合方案导致模型过度依赖预定义特征组合，以及MoE方法中各专家网络处理分离特征而限制了信息交互。

Method: 提出DeReF框架，包含随机特征重组策略和动态MoE融合模块。在模态解耦模块中还添加了区域交叉注意力网络来改善解耦特征的表示质量。

Result: 在自建的肝癌数据集和三个公开TCGA数据集上进行了广泛实验，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: DeReF框枵能够有效解决多模态癌症生存分析中的特征融合挑战，提高模型的沿流性和一般化能力。

Abstract: Cancer survival analysis commonly integrates information across diverse
medical modalities to make survival-time predictions. Existing methods
primarily focus on extracting different decoupled features of modalities and
performing fusion operations such as concatenation, attention, and MoE-based
(Mixture-of-Experts) fusion. However, these methods still face two key
challenges: i) Fixed fusion schemes (concatenation and attention) can lead to
model over-reliance on predefined feature combinations, limiting the dynamic
fusion of decoupled features; ii) in MoE-based fusion methods, each expert
network handles separate decoupled features, which limits information
interaction among the decoupled features. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel Decoupling-Reorganization-Fusion framework (DeReF), which
devises a random feature reorganization strategy between modalities decoupling
and dynamic MoE fusion modules.Its advantages are: i) it increases the
diversity of feature combinations and granularity, enhancing the generalization
ability of the subsequent expert networks; ii) it overcomes the problem of
information closure and helps expert networks better capture information among
decoupled features. Additionally, we incorporate a regional cross-attention
network within the modality decoupling module to improve the representation
quality of decoupled features. Extensive experimental results on our in-house
Liver Cancer (LC) and three widely used TCGA public datasets confirm the
effectiveness of our proposed method. The code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: ROSE是一个视频对象移除框架，专门处理对象移除后的副作用（如阴影、反射等），通过合成数据训练和扩散变换器实现高质量的视频修复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频对象移除方法在处理对象副作用（阴影、反射、光照等）时表现不佳，主要原因是缺乏配对的监督数据。

Method: 使用3D渲染引擎生成合成数据，构建大规模配对数据集；基于扩散变换器构建视频修复模型；引入额外监督来显式预测副作用区域；提出新的基准测试ROSE-Bench。

Result: 实验结果表明ROSE在视频对象擦除方面优于现有方法，并能很好地泛化到真实世界视频场景。

Conclusion: ROSE框架通过系统性处理对象副作用和合成数据训练，显著提升了视频对象移除的质量和泛化能力。

Abstract: Video object removal has achieved advanced performance due to the recent
success of video generative models. However, when addressing the side effects
of objects, e.g., their shadows and reflections, existing works struggle to
eliminate these effects for the scarcity of paired video data as supervision.
This paper presents ROSE, termed Remove Objects with Side Effects, a framework
that systematically studies the object's effects on environment, which can be
categorized into five common cases: shadows, reflections, light, translucency
and mirror. Given the challenges of curating paired videos exhibiting the
aforementioned effects, we leverage a 3D rendering engine for synthetic data
generation. We carefully construct a fully-automatic pipeline for data
preparation, which simulates a large-scale paired dataset with diverse scenes,
objects, shooting angles, and camera trajectories. ROSE is implemented as an
video inpainting model built on diffusion transformer. To localize all
object-correlated areas, the entire video is fed into the model for
reference-based erasing. Moreover, additional supervision is introduced to
explicitly predict the areas affected by side effects, which can be revealed
through the differential mask between the paired videos. To fully investigate
the model performance on various side effect removal, we presents a new
benchmark, dubbed ROSE-Bench, incorporating both common scenarios and the five
special side effects for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results
demonstrate that ROSE achieves superior performance compared to existing video
object erasing models and generalizes well to real-world video scenarios. The

Motivation: 现有视频字幕生成方法存在运动-细节不平衡问题，模型往往过度强调一个方面而忽视另一个方面，导致生成的字幕不完整，影响视频理解和生成的一致性

Method: 1) 数据层面：通过Motion-Detail Fusion和Fine-Grained Examination两阶段流程构建HMD-270K数据集；2) 优化层面：基于Group Relative Policy Optimization引入Caption Set Equivalence Reward，通过单元到集合匹配和双向验证来增强完整性和准确性

Result: OwlCap模型在两个基准测试上取得显著改进：细节导向的VDC（+4.2 Acc）和运动导向的DREAM-1K（+4.6 F1）

Conclusion: 提出的HMD-270K数据集和OwlCap模型有效解决了视频字幕生成中的运动-细节不平衡问题，将公开发布以促进视频字幕研究社区的发展

Abstract: Video captioning aims to generate comprehensive and coherent descriptions of
the video content, contributing to the advancement of both video understanding
and generation. However, existing methods often suffer from motion-detail
imbalance, as models tend to overemphasize one aspect while neglecting the
other. This imbalance results in incomplete captions, which in turn leads to a
lack of consistency in video understanding and generation. To address this
issue, we propose solutions from two aspects: 1) Data aspect: We constructed
the Harmonizing Motion-Detail 270K (HMD-270K) dataset through a two-stage
pipeline: Motion-Detail Fusion (MDF) and Fine-Grained Examination (FGE). 2)
Optimization aspect: We introduce the Caption Set Equivalence Reward (CSER)
based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). CSER enhances completeness
and accuracy in capturing both motion and details through unit-to-set matching
and bidirectional validation. Based on the HMD-270K supervised fine-tuning and
GRPO post-training with CSER, we developed OwlCap, a powerful video captioning
multi-modal large language model (MLLM) with motion-detail balance.
Experimental results demonstrate that OwlCap achieves significant improvements
compared to baseline models on two benchmarks: the detail-focused VDC (+4.2
Acc) and the motion-focused DREAM-1K (+4.6 F1). The HMD-270K dataset and OwlCap
model will be publicly released to facilitate video captioning research
community advancements.

Abstract: Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBIs), play a crucial role in understanding ancient
Chinese civilization. The automated detection of OBIs from rubbing images
represents a fundamental yet challenging task in digital archaeology, primarily
due to various degradation factors including noise and cracks that limit the
effectiveness of conventional detection networks. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel clustering-based feature space representation learning
method. Our approach uniquely leverages the Oracle Bones Character (OBC) font
library dataset as prior knowledge to enhance feature extraction in the
detection network through clustering-based representation learning. The method
incorporates a specialized loss function derived from clustering results to
optimize feature representation, which is then integrated into the total
network loss. We validate the effectiveness of our method by conducting
experiments on two OBIs detection dataset using three mainstream detection
frameworks: Faster R-CNN, DETR, and Sparse R-CNN. Through extensive
experimentation, all frameworks demonstrate significant performance
improvements.

Motivation: 现有基于空间域SNR先验的水下图像增强方法存在两个局限：无法有效分离跨通道干扰，以及在放大信息结构同时抑制噪声方面帮助有限

Method: 提出频域SNR先验方法，将特征分解为幅度和相位谱；设计傅里叶注意力SNR先验变换器(FAST)和频率自适应变换器(FAT)；采用U型架构整合常规RGB流和SNR引导分支

Result: 在UIEB、EUVP和LSUI数据集的4800对图像上训练，PSNR提升3.1dB，SSIM提升0.08，成功恢复水下场景的颜色、纹理和对比度

Conclusion: 频域SNR先验方法优于空间域方法，SFormer在各项指标上超越近期方法，有效解决了水下图像增强的关键问题

Abstract: Recent learning-based underwater image enhancement (UIE) methods have
advanced by incorporating physical priors into deep neural networks,
particularly using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) prior to reduce
wavelength-dependent attenuation. However, spatial domain SNR priors have two
limitations: (i) they cannot effectively separate cross-channel interference,
and (ii) they provide limited help in amplifying informative structures while
suppressing noise. To overcome these, we propose using the SNR prior in the
frequency domain, decomposing features into amplitude and phase spectra for
better channel modulation. We introduce the Fourier Attention SNR-prior
Transformer (FAST), combining spectral interactions with SNR cues to highlight
key spectral components. Additionally, the Frequency Adaptive Transformer (FAT)
bottleneck merges low- and high-frequency branches using a gated attention
mechanism to enhance perceptual quality. Embedded in a unified U-shaped
architecture, these modules integrate a conventional RGB stream with an
SNR-guided branch, forming SFormer. Trained on 4,800 paired images from UIEB,
EUVP, and LSUI, SFormer surpasses recent methods with a 3.1 dB gain in PSNR and
0.08 in SSIM, successfully restoring colors, textures, and contrast in
underwater scenes.

Motivation: 现有研究虽然分割性能良好，但在EF估计方面表现不佳，需要同时处理单帧细节和多帧时空关系来提升EF计算准确性

Method: 采用分层设计：低层使用卷积网络处理单帧图像保留细节，高层使用Mamba架构捕捉时空关系；提出时空交叉扫描(STCS)模块通过跨帧和跨位置的跳跃扫描整合长程上下文信息

Result: 网络设计平衡了单帧和多帧处理，避免了仅依赖单帧时的局部误差累积或仅使用多帧数据时的细节忽略问题

Conclusion: 该方法能够减轻超声图像噪声等因素引起的EF计算偏差，提高EF估计的准确性

Abstract: Automated segmentation of the left ventricular endocardium in
echocardiography videos is a key research area in cardiology. It aims to
provide accurate assessment of cardiac structure and function through Ejection
Fraction (EF) estimation. Although existing studies have achieved good
segmentation performance, their results do not perform well in EF estimation.
In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network
(\ourmodel) for echocardiography video, aiming to improve EF estimation
accuracy by synergizing local detail modeling with global dynamic perception.
The network employs a hierarchical design, with low-level stages using
convolutional networks to process single-frame images and preserve details,
while high-level stages utilize the Mamba architecture to capture
spatio-temporal relationships. The hierarchical design balances single-frame
and multi-frame processing, avoiding issues such as local error accumulation
when relying solely on single frames or neglecting details when using only
multi-frame data. To overcome local spatio-temporal limitations, we propose the
Spatio-temporal Cross Scan (STCS) module, which integrates long-range context
through skip scanning across frames and positions. This approach helps mitigate
EF calculation biases caused by ultrasound image noise and other factors.

TL;DR: FPS是一种新颖的无监督域适应框架，通过冻结预训练特征编码器并优化决策边界来解决域偏移问题，在保持高性能的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的无监督域适应方法主要依赖微调特征提取器，存在效率低、可解释性差和难以扩展到现代架构的问题。研究发现预训练模型的特征空间具有域不变的几何模式，域偏移主要表现为边界错位而非特征退化。

Method: 提出特征空间平面搜索器(FPS)框架，保持特征编码器冻结状态，利用预训练模型特征空间中的几何模式（类内聚类和类间分离）来优化决策边界，实现离线特征提取和全数据集单次计算优化。

Result: 在公共基准测试中，FPS达到或超越了最先进方法的性能，能够高效扩展到多模态大模型，并在蛋白质结构预测、遥感分类和地震检测等多个领域展现出色表现。

Conclusion: FPS为迁移学习提供了一个简单、有效且通用的范式，特别适用于域适应任务，具有显著的计算效率和可解释性优势。

Abstract: Domain shift, characterized by degraded model performance during transition
from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains, poses a persistent
challenge for deploying deep learning systems. Current unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) methods predominantly rely on fine-tuning feature extractors -
an approach limited by inefficiency, reduced interpretability, and poor
scalability to modern architectures.
  Our analysis reveals that models pretrained on large-scale data exhibit
domain-invariant geometric patterns in their feature space, characterized by
intra-class clustering and inter-class separation, thereby preserving
transferable discriminative structures. These findings indicate that domain
shifts primarily manifest as boundary misalignment rather than feature
degradation.
  Unlike fine-tuning entire pre-trained models - which risks introducing
unpredictable feature distortions - we propose the Feature-space Planes
Searcher (FPS): a novel domain adaptation framework that optimizes decision
boundaries by leveraging these geometric patterns while keeping the feature
encoder frozen. This streamlined approach enables interpretative analysis of
adaptation while substantially reducing memory and computational costs through
offline feature extraction, permitting full-dataset optimization in a single
computation cycle.
  Evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that FPS achieves competitive or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods. FPS scales efficiently with
multimodal large models and shows versatility across diverse domains including
protein structure prediction, remote sensing classification, and earthquake
detection. We anticipate FPS will provide a simple, effective, and
generalizable paradigm for transfer learning, particularly in domain adaptation
tasks. .

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a pivotal role in various
applications, including smart surveillance, healthcare, assistive technologies,
sports analytics, etc. However, HAR systems still face critical challenges,
including high computational costs, redundant features, and limited scalability
in real-time scenarios. An optimized hybrid deep learning framework is
introduced that integrates a customized InceptionV3, an LSTM architecture, and
a novel ensemble-based feature selection strategy. The proposed framework first
extracts spatial descriptors using the customized InceptionV3 model, which
captures multilevel contextual patterns, region homogeneity, and fine-grained
localization cues. The temporal dependencies across frames are then modeled
using LSTMs to effectively encode motion dynamics. Finally, an ensemble-based
genetic algorithm with Adaptive Dynamic Fitness Sharing and Attention (ADFSA)
is employed to select a compact and optimized feature set by dynamically
balancing objectives such as accuracy, redundancy, uniqueness, and complexity
reduction. Consequently, the selected feature subsets, which are both diverse
and discriminative, enable various lightweight machine learning classifiers to
achieve accurate and robust HAR in heterogeneous environments. Experimental
results on the robust UCF-YouTube dataset, which presents challenges such as
occlusion, cluttered backgrounds, motion dynamics, and poor illumination,
demonstrate good performance. The proposed approach achieves 99.65% recognition
accuracy, reduces features to as few as 7, and enhances inference time. The
lightweight and scalable nature of the HAR system supports real-time deployment
on edge devices such as Raspberry Pi, enabling practical applications in
intelligent, resource-aware environments, including public safety, assistive
technology, and autonomous monitoring systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ColorGS是一个用于内窥镜视频中可变形组织重建的新框架，通过空间自适应颜色编码和增强变形建模，在保持实时渲染效率的同时实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在捕捉细微颜色变化和建模全局变形方面存在局限性，3D高斯泼溅的固定颜色分配难以处理复杂纹理，线性变形建模无法保持一致的全局变形。

Method: 提出Colored Gaussian Primitives使用动态锚点和可学习颜色参数自适应编码空间变化纹理；设计Enhanced Deformation Model结合时间感知高斯基函数和可学习时间无关变形，精确捕捉局部组织变形和全局运动一致性。

Result: 在达芬奇机器人手术视频和基准数据集上，ColorGS达到PSNR 39.85（比之前3DGS方法高1.5）和SSIM 97.25%的优异性能，同时保持实时渲染效率。

Conclusion: ColorGS通过平衡高保真度和计算实用性，推进了手术场景重建技术，对术中指导和AR/VR应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: High-fidelity reconstruction of deformable tissues from endoscopic videos
remains challenging due to the limitations of existing methods in capturing
subtle color variations and modeling global deformations. While 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) enables efficient dynamic reconstruction, its fixed
per-Gaussian color assignment struggles with intricate textures, and linear
deformation modeling fails to model consistent global deformation. To address
these issues, we propose ColorGS, a novel framework that integrates spatially
adaptive color encoding and enhanced deformation modeling for surgical scene
reconstruction. First, we introduce Colored Gaussian Primitives, which employ
dynamic anchors with learnable color parameters to adaptively encode spatially
varying textures, significantly improving color expressiveness under complex
lighting and tissue similarity. Second, we design an Enhanced Deformation Model
(EDM) that combines time-aware Gaussian basis functions with learnable
time-independent deformations, enabling precise capture of both localized
tissue deformations and global motion consistency caused by surgical
interactions. Extensive experiments on DaVinci robotic surgery videos and
benchmark datasets (EndoNeRF, StereoMIS) demonstrate that ColorGS achieves
state-of-the-art performance, attaining a PSNR of 39.85 (1.5 higher than prior
3DGS-based methods) and superior SSIM (97.25\%) while maintaining real-time
rendering efficiency. Our work advances surgical scene reconstruction by
balancing high fidelity with computational practicality, critical for
intraoperative guidance and AR/VR applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出类别级洪水正则化方法，通过为不同类别设置基于频率的洪水阈值，在抑制多数类过拟合的同时允许少数类充分学习，提升不平衡数据集上的分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络在不平衡数据集上训练时对少数类识别性能显著下降的问题，传统方法往往偏向多数类。

Method: 扩展洪水正则化到类别级别，根据类别频率为每个类别分配特定的洪水阈值，抑制多数类过拟合，允许少数类充分学习。

Result: 在不平衡图像分类任务上验证，相比传统洪水正则化方法，提升了少数类的分类性能并获得更好的整体泛化能力。

Conclusion: 类别级洪水正则化是处理类别不平衡问题的有效方法，通过差异化正则化策略平衡各类别的学习过程。

Abstract: The purpose of training neural networks is to achieve high generalization
performance on unseen inputs. However, when trained on imbalanced datasets, a
model's prediction tends to favor majority classes over minority classes,
leading to significant degradation in the recognition performance of minority
classes. To address this issue, we propose class-wise flooding regularization,
an extension of flooding regularization applied at the class level. Flooding is
a regularization technique that mitigates overfitting by preventing the
training loss from falling below a predefined threshold, known as the flooding
level, thereby discouraging memorization. Our proposed method assigns a
class-specific flooding level based on class frequencies. By doing so, it
suppresses overfitting in majority classes while allowing sufficient learning
for minority classes. We validate our approach on imbalanced image
classification. Compared to conventional flooding regularizations, our method
improves the classification performance of minority classes and achieves better
overall generalization.

*Hiroaki Aizawa,Yoshikazu Hayashi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了对抗性难度度量(ADM)来解决课程学习与锐度感知最小化结合时的困难评估问题，在图像分类、细粒度识别和领域泛化任务中表现出色


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统课程学习基于样本难度选择训练样本，但在平坦区域中损失值和梯度范数都变得均匀小，难以评估样本难度和设计有效课程

Method: 提出对抗性难度度量(ADM)，利用平坦最小值训练模型的鲁棒性特性，通过测量原始样本和对抗样本之间的归一化损失差距来量化对抗脆弱性

Result: 在图像分类任务、细粒度识别和领域泛化中，该方法保留了课程学习和SAM的优势，同时超越了现有的基于课程和平坦感知的训练策略

Conclusion: ADM方法有效解决了平坦区域中样本难度评估的挑战，成功结合了课程学习和锐度感知最小化的优势

Abstract: Neural networks trained by empirical risk minimization often suffer from
overfitting, especially to specific samples or domains, which leads to poor
generalization. Curriculum Learning (CL) addresses this issue by selecting
training samples based on the difficulty. From the optimization perspective,
methods such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improve robustness and
generalization by seeking flat minima. However, combining CL with SAM is not
straightforward. In flat regions, both the loss values and the gradient norms
tend to become uniformly small, which makes it difficult to evaluate sample
difficulty and design an effective curriculum. To overcome this problem, we
propose the Adversarial Difficulty Measure (ADM), which quantifies adversarial
vulnerability by leveraging the robustness properties of models trained toward
flat minima. Unlike loss- or gradient-based measures, which become ineffective
as training progresses into flatter regions, ADM remains informative by
measuring the normalized loss gap between original and adversarial examples. We
incorporate ADM into CL-based training with SAM to dynamically assess sample
difficulty. We evaluated our approach on image classification tasks,
fine-grained recognition, and domain generalization. The results demonstrate
that our method preserves the strengths of both CL and SAM while outperforming
existing curriculum-based and flatness-aware training strategies.

*Melanie Wille,Tobias Fischer,Scarlett Raine*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文通过分析水下目标检测中的性能差异，发现定位阶段的前景-背景区分是主要挑战，分类阶段存在固有特征难度，建议根据精度或召回率优先选择不同的数据分布策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下目标检测对海洋生态监测至关重要，但存在图像质量退化、类别分布不平衡和独特视觉特征等挑战。不同物种检测性能差异显著，但根本原因尚不清楚。

Method: 使用DUO数据集，将目标检测任务分解为定位和分类两个阶段，利用YOLO11和TIDE工具分析扇贝类别的性能不足问题，进行定位和分类实验。

Result: 定位分析发现前景-背景区分是最困难的阶段，不受数据量影响；分类实验显示即使数据平衡也存在精度差距，表明存在超越数据稀缺和类间依赖的固有特征挑战。

Conclusion: 建议在优先精度时使用不平衡分布，优先召回率时使用平衡分布。改进性能不佳类别应重点关注算法进步，特别是在定位模块方面。代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: Underwater object detection is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems but
poses unique challenges, including degraded image quality, imbalanced class
distribution, and distinct visual characteristics. Not every species is
detected equally well, yet underlying causes remain unclear. We address two key
research questions: 1) What factors beyond data quantity drive class-specific
performance disparities? 2) How can we systematically improve detection of
under-performing marine species? We manipulate the DUO dataset to separate the
object detection task into localization and classification and investigate the
under-performance of the scallop class. Localization analysis using YOLO11 and
TIDE finds that foreground-background discrimination is the most problematic
stage regardless of data quantity. Classification experiments reveal persistent
precision gaps even with balanced data, indicating intrinsic feature-based
challenges beyond data scarcity and inter-class dependencies. We recommend
imbalanced distributions when prioritizing precision, and balanced
distributions when prioritizing recall. Improving under-performing classes
should focus on algorithmic advances, especially within localization modules.
We publicly release our code and datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CAD生成方法多从点云、网格或文本输入开始，与传统工业工作流程（从2D工程图开始）存在根本差异，从2D矢量图自动生成参数化CAD模型的研究仍不足。

Method: 提出Drawing2CAD框架，包含三个关键技术：网络友好的矢量图元表示、双解码器Transformer架构（解耦命令类型和参数生成）、软目标分布损失函数。

Result: 创建了CAD-VGDrawing数据集进行训练和评估，实验证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将CAD生成重构为序列到序列学习问题，在保持几何精度和设计意图的同时实现了从2D工程图到参数化CAD模型的自动转换。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) generative modeling is driving significant
innovations across industrial applications. Recent works have shown remarkable
progress in creating solid models from various inputs such as point clouds,
meshes, and text descriptions. However, these methods fundamentally diverge
from traditional industrial workflows that begin with 2D engineering drawings.
The automatic generation of parametric CAD models from these 2D vector drawings
remains underexplored despite being a critical step in engineering design. To
address this gap, our key insight is to reframe CAD generation as a
sequence-to-sequence learning problem where vector drawing primitives directly
inform the generation of parametric CAD operations, preserving geometric
precision and design intent throughout the transformation process. We propose
Drawing2CAD, a framework with three key technical components: a
network-friendly vector primitive representation that preserves precise
geometric information, a dual-decoder transformer architecture that decouples
command type and parameter generation while maintaining precise correspondence,
and a soft target distribution loss function accommodating inherent flexibility
in CAD parameters. To train and evaluate Drawing2CAD, we create CAD-VGDrawing,
a dataset of paired engineering drawings and parametric CAD models, and conduct
thorough experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/lllssc/Drawing2CAD.

### [32] [Rethinking Human-Object Interaction Evaluation for both Vision-Language Models and HOI-Specific Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18753)
*Qinqian Lei,Bo Wang,Robby T. Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新的人物交互检测测试标准，将HOI检测重新定义为多选题任务，以适应生成式视觉语言模型的特性，避免因正确预测与标注不完全匹配而被惩罚的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HOI测试标准要求与标注类别完全匹配，但生成式VLM模型在模糊情况下可能产生多种合理解释。现有标准无法公平评估这些模型的能力，需要新的评估方案来比较通用VLM专门HOI方法。

Method: 设计了一个多答案多选题式的测试标准，每道题包含真实正确选项和细心筛选的负面选项。避免将合理但未标注的交互方式作为负面示例，以减少模糊性并保证评估的公正性。

Result: 新标准能够更全面地评估生成式VLM模型在HOI检测任务中的表现，避免了因标注不完整而导致的评分偏差。该方案同时适用于通用VLM和专门HOI方法的直接比较。

Conclusion: 这个新的多选题式评估协议为HOI理解领域提供了更全面的测量标准，能够更准确地评估生成式VLM模型的能力，并为不同方法之间的公平比较提供基础。

Abstract: Prior human-object interaction (HOI) detection methods have integrated early
vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP, but only as supporting components
within their frameworks. In contrast, recent advances in large, generative VLMs
suggest that these models may already possess strong ability to understand
images involving HOI. This naturally raises an important question: can
general-purpose standalone VLMs effectively solve HOI detection, and how do
they compare with specialized HOI methods? Answering this requires a benchmark
that can accommodate both paradigms. However, existing HOI benchmarks such as
HICO-DET were developed before the emergence of modern VLMs, and their
evaluation protocols require exact matches to annotated HOI classes. This is
poorly aligned with the generative nature of VLMs, which often yield multiple
valid interpretations in ambiguous cases. For example, a static image may
capture a person mid-motion with a frisbee, which can plausibly be interpreted
as either "throwing" or "catching". When only "catching" is annotated, the
other, though equally plausible for the image, is marked incorrect when exact
matching is used. As a result, correct predictions might be penalized,
affecting both VLMs and HOI-specific methods. To avoid penalizing valid
predictions, we introduce a new benchmark that reformulates HOI detection as a
multiple-answer multiple-choice task, where each question includes only
ground-truth positive options and a curated set of negatives that are
constructed to reduce ambiguity (e.g., when "catching" is annotated, "throwing"
is not selected as a negative to avoid penalizing valid predictions). The
proposed evaluation protocol is the first of its kind for both VLMs and HOI
methods, enabling direct comparison and offering new insight into the current
state of progress in HOI understanding.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注文本选项的多选题生成，忽视了视觉选项的重要性，且高质量干扰项的手工制作成本高、可扩展性差。

Method: 结合多模态思维链推理和检索增强生成技术，生成语义合理且视觉相似的答案和干扰项，并包含内容判别模块识别适合视觉选项的内容。

Result: 实验结果表明，CmOS在不同学科和教育水平的内容判别、问题生成和视觉选项生成方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CmOS框架有效解决了教育多选题中视觉选项生成的挑战，为自动化生成高质量多选题提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) play a crucial role in fostering deep
thinking and knowledge integration in education. However, previous research has
primarily focused on generating MCQs with textual options, but it largely
overlooks the visual options. Moreover, generating high-quality distractors
remains a major challenge due to the high cost and limited scalability of
manual authoring. To tackle these problems, we propose a Cross-modal Options
Synthesis (CmOS), a novel framework for generating educational MCQs with visual
options. Our framework integrates Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) reasoning
process and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce semantically
plausible and visually similar answer and distractors. It also includes a
discrimination module to identify content suitable for visual options.
Experimental results on test tasks demonstrate the superiority of CmOS in
content discrimination, question generation and visual option generation over
existing methods across various subjects and educational levels.

Abstract: The growing integration of smart environments and low-power computing
devices, coupled with mass-market sensor technologies, is driving advancements
in remote and non-contact physiological monitoring. However, deploying these
systems in real-time on resource-constrained platforms introduces significant
challenges related to scalability, interoperability, and performance. This
paper presents a real-time remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) system optimized
for low-power devices, designed to extract physiological signals, such as heart
rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and oxygen saturation (SpO2), from facial
video streams. The system is built on the Face2PPG pipeline, which processes
video frames sequentially for rPPG signal extraction and analysis, while
leveraging a multithreaded architecture to manage video capture, real-time
processing, network communication, and graphical user interface (GUI) updates
concurrently. This design ensures continuous, reliable operation at 30 frames
per second (fps), with adaptive feedback through a collaborative user interface
to guide optimal signal capture conditions. The network interface includes both
an HTTP server for continuous video streaming and a RESTful API for on-demand
vital sign retrieval. To ensure accurate performance despite the limitations of
low-power devices, we use a hybrid programming model combining Functional
Reactive Programming (FRP) and the Actor Model, allowing event-driven
processing and efficient task parallelization. The system is evaluated under
real-time constraints, demonstrating robustness while minimizing computational
overhead. Our work addresses key challenges in real-time biosignal monitoring,
offering practical solutions for optimizing performance in modern healthcare
and human-computer interaction applications.

Conclusion: PseudoMapTrainer为解决在线地图建模对真值数据的依赖提供了有效方案，能够利用无标签数据提升模型性能

Abstract: Online mapping models show remarkable results in predicting vectorized maps
from multi-view camera images only. However, all existing approaches still rely
on ground-truth high-definition maps during training, which are expensive to
obtain and often not geographically diverse enough for reliable generalization.
In this work, we propose PseudoMapTrainer, a novel approach to online mapping
that uses pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled sensor data. We derive those
pseudo-labels by reconstructing the road surface from multi-camera imagery
using Gaussian splatting and semantics of a pre-trained 2D segmentation
network. In addition, we introduce a mask-aware assignment algorithm and loss
function to handle partially masked pseudo-labels, allowing for the first time
the training of online mapping models without any ground-truth maps.
Furthermore, our pseudo-labels can be effectively used to pre-train an online
model in a semi-supervised manner to leverage large-scale unlabeled
crowdsourced data. The code is available at
github.com/boschresearch/PseudoMapTrainer.

Abstract: Effective waste sorting is critical for sustainable recycling, yet AI
research in this domain continues to lag behind commercial systems due to
limited datasets and reliance on legacy object detectors. In this work, we
advance AI-driven waste detection by establishing strong baselines and
introducing an ensemble-based semi-supervised learning framework. We first
benchmark state-of-the-art Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) models on
the real-world ZeroWaste dataset, demonstrating that while class-only prompts
perform poorly, LLM-optimized prompts significantly enhance zero-shot accuracy.
Next, to address domain-specific limitations, we fine-tune modern
transformer-based detectors, achieving a new baseline of 51.6 mAP. We then
propose a soft pseudo-labeling strategy that fuses ensemble predictions using
spatial and consensus-aware weighting, enabling robust semi-supervised
training. Applied to the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, our pseudo-annotations
achieve performance gains that surpass fully supervised training, underscoring
the effectiveness of scalable annotation pipelines. Our work contributes to the
research community by establishing rigorous baselines, introducing a robust
ensemble-based pseudo-labeling pipeline, generating high-quality annotations
for the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, and systematically evaluating OVOD models
under real-world waste sorting conditions. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同字体样式传达不同印象，字体形状与印象标签存在紧密关系。标准词嵌入方法（如BERT和CLIP）在这些标签上生成的向量差异过大，不适合用于印象导向的字体处理任务。

Method: 构建一个图结构，节点代表印象标签，边缘编码标签间的共现关系。然后应用谱嵌入技术来获取每个标签的印象向量。

Result: 经过定性和定量评估，该方法在印象导向的字体生成任务上表现超过BERT和CLIP方法。

Conclusion: 该研究提供的印象标签嵌入方法能够更准确地描述字体的印象特征，对于印象基于的字体生成和检索应用具有重要价值。

Abstract: Different font styles (i.e., font shapes) convey distinct impressions,
indicating a close relationship between font shapes and word tags describing
those impressions. This paper proposes a novel embedding method for impression
tags that leverages these shape-impression relationships. For instance, our
method assigns similar vectors to impression tags that frequently co-occur in
order to represent impressions of fonts, whereas standard word embedding
methods (e.g., BERT and CLIP) yield very different vectors. This property is
particularly useful for impression-based font generation and font retrieval.
Technically, we construct a graph whose nodes represent impression tags and
whose edges encode co-occurrence relationships. Then, we apply spectral
embedding to obtain the impression vectors for each tag. We compare our method
with BERT and CLIP in qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating
that our approach performs better in impression-guided font generation.

Abstract: National Forest Inventory (NFI)s serve as the primary source of forest
information, providing crucial tree species distribution data. However,
maintaining these inventories requires labor-intensive on-site campaigns.
Remote sensing approaches, particularly when combined with machine learning,
offer opportunities to update NFIs more frequently and at larger scales. While
the use of Satellite Image Time Series has proven effective for distinguishing
tree species through seasonal canopy reflectance patterns, current approaches
rely primarily on Random Forest classifiers with hand-designed features and
phenology-based metrics. Using deep features from an available pre-trained
remote sensing foundation models offers a complementary strategy. These
pre-trained models leverage unannotated global data and are meant to used for
general-purpose applications and can then be efficiently fine-tuned with
smaller labeled datasets for specific classification tasks. This work
systematically investigates how deep features improve tree species
classification accuracy in the Netherlands with few annotated data. Data-wise,
we extracted time-series data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and ERA5 satellites
data and SRTM data using Google Earth Engine. Our results demonstrate that
fine-tuning a publicly available remote sensing time series foundation model
outperforms the current state-of-the-art in NFI classification in the
Netherlands by a large margin of up to 10% across all datasets. This
demonstrates that classic hand-defined harmonic features are too simple for
this task and highlights the potential of using deep AI features for
data-limited application like NFI classification. By leveraging openly
available satellite data and pre-trained models, this approach significantly
improves classification accuracy compared to traditional methods and can
effectively complement existing forest inventory processes.

*Zizheng Guo,Bochao Zou,Yinuo Jia,Xiangyu Li,Huimin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种先验引导的视频级回归方法，用于微表情分析，通过可扩展区间选择策略和协同优化框架，在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有微表情分析方法大多依赖固定窗口大小的窗口级分类，难以捕捉复杂的时序动态。虽然近期方法采用视频级回归框架，但区间解码仍依赖手动预定义的基于窗口的方法，问题仅得到部分缓解。

Method: 提出先验引导的视频级回归方法，引入可扩展区间选择策略，综合考虑微表情的时序演化、持续时间和类别分布特征，实现起始点、顶点和偏移点的精确定位。采用协同优化框架，定位和识别任务共享参数（除分类头外），充分利用互补信息。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，CAS(ME)^3数据集上STRS为0.0562，SAMMLV数据集上STRS为0.2000。

Conclusion: 该方法通过创新的区间选择策略和协同优化设计，有效解决了微表情分析中的时序动态捕捉问题，显著提升了分析性能。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary, low-intensity, and short-duration
facial expressions that often reveal an individual's genuine thoughts and
emotions. Most existing ME analysis methods rely on window-level classification
with fixed window sizes and hard decisions, which limits their ability to
capture the complex temporal dynamics of MEs. Although recent approaches have
adopted video-level regression frameworks to address some of these challenges,
interval decoding still depends on manually predefined, window-based methods,
leaving the issue only partially mitigated. In this paper, we propose a
prior-guided video-level regression method for ME analysis. We introduce a
scalable interval selection strategy that comprehensively considers the
temporal evolution, duration, and class distribution characteristics of MEs,
enabling precise spotting of the onset, apex, and offset phases. In addition,
we introduce a synergistic optimization framework, in which the spotting and
recognition tasks share parameters except for the classification heads. This
fully exploits complementary information, makes more efficient use of limited
data, and enhances the model's capability. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method,
with an STRS of 0.0562 on CAS(ME)$^3$ and 0.2000 on SAMMLV. The code is

TL;DR: 提出基于图像处理的定量评估框架，通过几何异常模型和检测记分机制，对微行网状罐合术进行客观评估


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微行网状罐合术需要高超技能，但现有评估方法依赖主观判断，存在偏差，影响评估的可靠性和效率

Method: 利用三个医院数据集，采用图像处理技术，通过几何异常模型和检测记分机制，建立定量评估框架

Result: 几何指标能够有效复现专家评分者对异常的记分，提高了微行外科技能评估的效率和可靠性

Conclusion: 该定量框架能够客观、高效地评估微行网状罐合术技能，推动培训方案的进步

Abstract: Microsurgical anastomosis demands exceptional dexterity and visuospatial
skills, underscoring the importance of comprehensive training and precise
outcome assessment. Currently, methods such as the outcome-oriented anastomosis
lapse index are used to evaluate this procedure. However, they often rely on
subjective judgment, which can introduce biases that affect the reliability and
efficiency of the assessment of competence. Leveraging three datasets from
hospitals with participants at various levels, we introduce a quantitative
framework that uses image-processing techniques for objective assessment of
microsurgical anastomoses. The approach uses geometric modeling of errors along
with a detection and scoring mechanism, enhancing the efficiency and
reliability of microsurgical proficiency assessment and advancing training
protocols. The results show that the geometric metrics effectively replicate
expert raters' scoring for the errors considered in this work.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的视频稳定方法，通过测试时快速适应每个输入视频来改进像素级合成视频稳定技术，利用推理时的低层视觉线索提升输出稳定性和视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的像素级合成视频稳定方法虽然能合成全帧输出，但由于视频序列中运动模式和视觉内容的多样性，使用固定参数难以实现鲁棒的泛化性能。

Method: 采用快速适应策略，在测试时为每个输入视频快速调整模型；提出抖动定位模块和针对性适应策略，专注于高抖动片段进行适应；利用推理时可用的低层视觉线索。

Result: 即使单次适应也能获得显著的性能提升；在各种真实世界数据集上的实验证明了方法的通用性；在定性和定量指标上都改进了多种全帧合成模型的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法使现代稳定器能够超越现有SOTA方法，同时保持现代方法的全帧特性，并为用户提供类似经典方法的控制机制，在下游应用中表现出色。

Abstract: Video stabilization remains a fundamental problem in computer vision,
particularly pixel-level synthesis solutions for video stabilization, which
synthesize full-frame outputs, add to the complexity of this task. These
methods aim to enhance stability while synthesizing full-frame videos, but the
inherent diversity in motion profiles and visual content present in each video
sequence makes robust generalization with fixed parameters difficult. To
address this, we present a novel method that improves pixel-level synthesis
video stabilization methods by rapidly adapting models to each input video at
test time. The proposed approach takes advantage of low-level visual cues
available during inference to improve both the stability and visual quality of
the output. Notably, the proposed rapid adaptation achieves significant
performance gains even with a single adaptation pass. We further propose a jerk
localization module and a targeted adaptation strategy, which focuses the
adaptation on high-jerk segments for maximizing stability with fewer adaptation
steps. The proposed methodology enables modern stabilizers to overcome the
longstanding SOTA approaches while maintaining the full frame nature of the
modern methods, while offering users with control mechanisms akin to classical
approaches. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate
the versatility of the proposed method. Our approach consistently improves the
performance of various full-frame synthesis models in both qualitative and
quantitative terms, including results on downstream applications.

TL;DR: DualFairVL是一个多模态提示学习框架，通过并行双分支架构联合去偏和对齐跨模态表示，在医学影像诊断中实现公平性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学诊断中确保跨人口群体的公平性至关重要，特别是在成像设备和临床实践变化导致的分布偏移下。现有去偏方法通常独立处理视觉和文本模态，存在残留的跨模态不对齐和公平性差距。

Method: 采用并行双分支架构分离敏感属性和目标属性，构建近似正交的文本锚点指导跨注意力机制，使用超网络生成实例感知的视觉提示，并应用基于原型的正则化来加强特征分离和对齐。

Result: 在8个医学影像数据集上的实验表明，DualFairVL在分布内和分布外设置下均实现了最先进的公平性和准确性，仅使用360万可训练参数就优于全微调和参数高效基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了跨模态不对齐问题，在医学影像诊断中实现了公平性和鲁棒性的双重提升，为多模态公平学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness across demographic groups in medical diagnosis is essential
for equitable healthcare, particularly under distribution shifts caused by
variations in imaging equipment and clinical practice. Vision-language models
(VLMs) exhibit strong generalization, and text prompts encode identity
attributes, enabling explicit identification and removal of sensitive
directions. However, existing debiasing approaches typically address vision and
text modalities independently, leaving residual cross-modal misalignment and
fairness gaps. To address this challenge, we propose DualFairVL, a multimodal
prompt-learning framework that jointly debiases and aligns cross-modal
representations. DualFairVL employs a parallel dual-branch architecture that
separates sensitive and target attributes, enabling disentangled yet aligned
representations across modalities. Approximately orthogonal text anchors are
constructed via linear projections, guiding cross-attention mechanisms to
produce fused features. A hypernetwork further disentangles attribute-related
information and generates instance-aware visual prompts, which encode
dual-modal cues for fairness and robustness. Prototype-based regularization is
applied in the visual branch to enforce separation of sensitive features and
strengthen alignment with textual anchors. Extensive experiments on eight
medical imaging datasets across four modalities show that DualFairVL achieves
state-of-the-art fairness and accuracy under both in- and out-of-distribution
settings, outperforming full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient baselines with
only 3.6M trainable parameters. Code will be released upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出双查询增强网络(DQEN)，通过对象感知编码器特征增强对象查询，利用CLIP模型提取语义特征增强交互查询初始化，在HOI检测任务中取得竞争性性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DETR-based HOI检测模型使用随机初始化的查询导致表示模糊，限制了模型效果。人类在HOI类别中是固定的，而对象和交互是可变的，因此需要分别增强对象和交互查询

Method: 1) 使用对象感知编码器特征增强对象查询；2) 设计交互语义融合模块利用CLIP模型提升的HOI候选；3) 引入辅助预测单元改善交互特征表示

Result: 在HICO-Det和V-COCO数据集上取得了竞争性性能

Conclusion: DQEN通过分别增强对象和交互查询，有效提升了HOI检测的准确性，证明了明确语义查询的重要性

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection focuses on localizing human-object
pairs and recognizing their interactions. Recently, the DETR-based framework
has been widely adopted in HOI detection. In DETR-based HOI models, queries
with clear meaning are crucial for accurately detecting HOIs. However, prior
works have typically relied on randomly initialized queries, leading to vague
representations that limit the model's effectiveness. Meanwhile, humans in the
HOI categories are fixed, while objects and their interactions are variable.
Therefore, we propose a Dual Query Enhancement Network (DQEN) to enhance object
and interaction queries. Specifically, object queries are enhanced with
object-aware encoder features, enabling the model to focus more effectively on
humans interacting with objects in an object-aware way. On the other hand, we
design a novel Interaction Semantic Fusion module to exploit the HOI candidates
that are promoted by the CLIP model. Semantic features are extracted to enhance
the initialization of interaction queries, thereby improving the model's
ability to understand interactions. Furthermore, we introduce an Auxiliary
Prediction Unit aimed at improving the representation of interaction features.
Our proposed method achieves competitive performance on both the HICO-Det and
the V-COCO datasets. The source code is available at

Motivation: 端到端自动驾驶AI决策难以解释，特别是在复杂城市场景中，深度神经网络的非线性决策边界使得理解AI驱动决策背后的逻辑具有挑战性。

Method: 提出促进模型可解释性的损失函数，生成稀疏和局部化的特征图，通过特征激活显示哪些图像区域对预测控制命令有贡献。

Result: 在CARLA基准测试中，单目非集成模型超越了排行榜上的最佳方法，实现了更低的事故分数和最高的路线完成率，同时确保了可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了自动驾驶模型的可解释性，还通过减少违规行为提高了安全性，证明了可解释性与性能提升之间的正相关关系。

Abstract: Trustworthy AI is mandatory for the broad deployment of autonomous vehicles.
Although end-to-end approaches derive control commands directly from raw data,
interpreting these decisions remains challenging, especially in complex urban
scenarios. This is mainly attributed to very deep neural networks with
non-linear decision boundaries, making it challenging to grasp the logic behind
AI-driven decisions. This paper presents a method to enhance interpretability
while optimizing control commands in autonomous driving. To address this, we
propose loss functions that promote the interpretability of our model by
generating sparse and localized feature maps. The feature activations allow us
to explain which image regions contribute to the predicted control command. We
conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the feature extraction step and
validate our method on the CARLA benchmarks. We also demonstrate that our
approach improves interpretability, which correlates with reducing infractions,
yielding a safer, high-performance driving model. Notably, our monocular,
non-ensemble model surpasses the top-performing approaches from the CARLA
Leaderboard by achieving lower infraction scores and the highest route
completion rate, all while ensuring interpretability.

Abstract: The Event-Enriched Image Analysis (EVENTA) Grand Challenge, hosted at ACM
Multimedia 2025, introduces the first large-scale benchmark for event-level
multimodal understanding. Traditional captioning and retrieval tasks largely
focus on surface-level recognition of people, objects, and scenes, often
overlooking the contextual and semantic dimensions that define real-world
events. EVENTA addresses this gap by integrating contextual, temporal, and
semantic information to capture the who, when, where, what, and why behind an
image. Built upon the OpenEvents V1 dataset, the challenge features two tracks:
Event-Enriched Image Retrieval and Captioning, and Event-Based Image Retrieval.
A total of 45 teams from six countries participated, with evaluation conducted
through Public and Private Test phases to ensure fairness and reproducibility.
The top three teams were invited to present their solutions at ACM Multimedia
2025. EVENTA establishes a foundation for context-aware, narrative-driven
multimedia AI, with applications in journalism, media analysis, cultural
archiving, and accessibility. Further details about the challenge are available

Result: 构建了完整的分类流程和数据集结构，支持60、100、200帧不同序列长度的可扩展分析

Conclusion: 建立了群体行人分析的基础框架，为后续定量分析和人群动力学研究应用奠定基础

Abstract: This study presents an initial framework for distinguishing group and single
pedestrians based on real-world trajectory data, with the aim of analyzing
their differences in space utilization and emergent behavioral patterns. By
segmenting pedestrian trajectories into fixed time bins and applying a
Transformer-based pair classification model, we identify cohesive groups and
isolate single pedestrians over a structured sequence-based filtering process.
To prepare for deeper analysis, we establish a comprehensive metric framework
incorporating both spatial and behavioral dimensions. Spatial utilization
metrics include convex hull area, smallest enclosing circle radius, and
heatmap-based spatial densities to characterize how different pedestrian types
occupy and interact with space. Behavioral metrics such as velocity change,
motion angle deviation, clearance radius, and trajectory straightness are
designed to capture local adaptations and responses during interactions.
Furthermore, we introduce a typology of encounter types-single-to-single,
single-to-group, and group-to-group to categorize and later quantify different
interaction scenarios. Although this version focuses primarily on the
classification pipeline and dataset structuring, it establishes the groundwork
for scalable analysis across different sequence lengths 60, 100, and 200
frames. Future versions will incorporate complete quantitative analysis of the
proposed metrics and their implications for pedestrian simulation and space
design validation in crowd dynamics research.

Abstract: Monitoring coral reefs at large spatial scales remains an open challenge,
essential for assessing ecosystem health and informing conservation efforts.
While drone-based aerial imagery offers broad spatial coverage, its limited
resolution makes it difficult to reliably distinguish fine-scale classes, such
as coral morphotypes. At the same time, obtaining pixel-level annotations over
large spatial extents is costly and labor-intensive, limiting the scalability
of deep learning-based segmentation methods for aerial imagery. We present a
multi-scale weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework that addresses
this challenge by transferring fine-scale ecological information from
underwater imagery to aerial data. Our method enables large-scale coral reef
mapping from drone imagery with minimal manual annotation, combining
classification-based supervision, spatial interpolation and self-distillation
techniques. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach, enabling large-area
segmentation of coral morphotypes and demonstrating flexibility for integrating
new classes. This study presents a scalable, cost-effective methodology for
high-resolution reef monitoring, combining low-cost data collection, weakly
supervised deep learning and multi-scale remote sensing.

Abstract: Traditional map-making relies heavily on Geographic Information Systems
(GIS), requiring domain expertise and being time-consuming, especially for
repetitive tasks. Recent advances in generative AI (GenAI), particularly image
diffusion models, offer new opportunities for automating and democratizing the
map-making process. However, these models struggle with accurate map creation
due to limited control over spatial composition and semantic layout. To address
this, we integrate vector data to guide map generation in different styles,
specified by the textual prompts. Our model is the first to generate accurate
maps in controlled styles, and we have integrated it into a web application to
improve its usability and accessibility. We conducted a user study with
professional cartographers to assess the fidelity of generated maps, the
usability of the web application, and the implications of ever-emerging GenAI
in map-making. The findings have suggested the potential of our developed
application and, more generally, the GenAI models in helping both non-expert
users and professionals in creating maps more efficiently. We have also
outlined further technical improvements and emphasized the new role of
cartographers to advance the paradigm of AI-assisted map-making.

Motivation: 现有方法将风格驱动和主体驱动生成视为两个独立任务，存在明显对立。作者认为这两个目标可以统一，因为它们本质上都涉及内容和风格的解耦与重组

Method: 1) 构建大规模三元组数据集；2) 引入解耦学习方案，通过风格对齐训练和内容-风格解耦训练同时对齐风格特征并分离内容与风格；3) 加入风格奖励学习(SRL)进一步提升性能；4) 发布USO-Bench联合评估基准

Conclusion: USO成功统一了风格驱动和主体驱动的生成任务，证明了内容和风格解耦重组框架的有效性，为风格-主体联合优化提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Existing literature typically treats style-driven and subject-driven
generation as two disjoint tasks: the former prioritizes stylistic similarity,
whereas the latter insists on subject consistency, resulting in an apparent
antagonism. We argue that both objectives can be unified under a single
framework because they ultimately concern the disentanglement and
re-composition of content and style, a long-standing theme in style-driven
research. To this end, we present USO, a Unified Style-Subject Optimized
customization model. First, we construct a large-scale triplet dataset
consisting of content images, style images, and their corresponding stylized
content images. Second, we introduce a disentangled learning scheme that
simultaneously aligns style features and disentangles content from style
through two complementary objectives, style-alignment training and
content-style disentanglement training. Third, we incorporate a style
reward-learning paradigm denoted as SRL to further enhance the model's
performance. Finally, we release USO-Bench, the first benchmark that jointly
evaluates style similarity and subject fidelity across multiple metrics.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that USO achieves state-of-the-art
performance among open-source models along both dimensions of subject
consistency and style similarity. Code and model:

Motivation: 传统NeRF方法在视觉定位中会编码精细场景细节，存在隐私泄露风险，特别是在云服务部署时敏感信息可能被恢复

Method: 提出ppNeRF方法：1）建立NeRF隐私保护评估协议；2）使用自监督分割标签而非RGB图像训练，分割标签足够粗糙以隐藏可识别细节但保持3D区分性

Result: 实验显示传统NeRF的几何表示容易受到隐私攻击，而ppNeSF在分割空间中实现了最先进的视觉定位精度

Conclusion: ppNeSF通过分割监督训练有效解决了NeRF在视觉定位中的隐私问题，在保护隐私的同时保持了定位性能

Abstract: Visual localization (VL) is the task of estimating the camera pose in a known
scene. VL methods, a.o., can be distinguished based on how they represent the
scene, e.g., explicitly through a (sparse) point cloud or a collection of
images or implicitly through the weights of a neural network. Recently,
NeRF-based methods have become popular for VL. While NeRFs offer high-quality
novel view synthesis, they inadvertently encode fine scene details, raising
privacy concerns when deployed in cloud-based localization services as
sensitive information could be recovered. In this paper, we tackle this
challenge on two ends. We first propose a new protocol to assess
privacy-preservation of NeRF-based representations. We show that NeRFs trained
with photometric losses store fine-grained details in their geometry
representations, making them vulnerable to privacy attacks, even if the head
that predicts colors is removed. Second, we propose ppNeSF (Privacy-Preserving
Neural Segmentation Field), a NeRF variant trained with segmentation
supervision instead of RGB images. These segmentation labels are learned in a
self-supervised manner, ensuring they are coarse enough to obscure identifiable
scene details while remaining discriminativeness in 3D. The segmentation space
of ppNeSF can be used for accurate visual localization, yielding
state-of-the-art results.

incorporating RAG into Document VQA through different retrieval variants -
text-based retrieval using OCR tokens and purely visual retrieval without OCR -
across multiple models and benchmarks. Evaluated on the multi-page datasets
MP-DocVQA, DUDE, and InfographicVQA, the text-centric variant improves the
"concatenate-all-pages" baseline by up to +22.5 ANLS, while the visual variant
achieves +5.0 ANLS improvement without requiring any text extraction. An
ablation confirms that retrieval and reranking components drive most of the
gain, whereas the layout-guided chunking strategy - proposed in several recent
works to leverage page structure - fails to help on these datasets. Our
experiments demonstrate that careful evidence selection consistently boosts
accuracy across multiple model sizes and multi-page benchmarks, underscoring
its practical value for real-world Document VQA.

### [54] [Ask Me Again Differently: GRAS for Measuring Bias in Vision Language Models on Gender, Race, Age, and Skin Tone](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18989)
*Shaivi Malik,Hasnat Md Abdullah,Sriparna Saha,Amit Sheth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRAS是一个评估视觉语言模型(VLMs)人口统计偏见的基准测试，涵盖性别、种族、年龄和肤色等多个维度，并提出可解释的GRAS偏见评分指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在现实应用中的普及，理解其人口统计偏见变得至关重要，需要系统性的评估框架来量化这些偏见。

Method: 提出GRAS基准测试，包含最全面的人口统计多样性覆盖，并设计GRAS偏见评分指标来量化偏见程度。对5个最先进的VLM模型进行基准测试，并强调评估时需要考虑问题的多种表述方式。

Result: 测试发现所有模型都存在令人担忧的偏见水平，表现最好的模型GRAS偏见评分仅为2分（满分100分）。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型存在显著的人口统计偏见，需要通过多问题表述方式进行全面评估，GRAS基准为系统评估VLM偏见提供了有效工具。

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) become integral to real-world applications,
understanding their demographic biases is critical. We introduce GRAS, a
benchmark for uncovering demographic biases in VLMs across gender, race, age,
and skin tone, offering the most diverse coverage to date. We further propose
the GRAS Bias Score, an interpretable metric for quantifying bias. We benchmark
five state-of-the-art VLMs and reveal concerning bias levels, with the least
biased model attaining a GRAS Bias Score of only 2 out of 100. Our findings
also reveal a methodological insight: evaluating bias in VLMs with visual
question answering (VQA) requires considering multiple formulations of a
question. Our code, data, and evaluation results are publicly available.

*Siyuan You,Guozheng Xu,Pengwei Zhou,Qiwen Jin,Jian Yao,Li Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RoofSeg的端到端边缘感知Transformer网络，用于从LiDAR点云中分割屋顶平面，解决了现有深度学习方法在边缘精度和几何约束方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的屋顶平面分割方法存在三个问题：非真正端到端导致结果非最优、边缘区域特征判别性低导致边缘不准确、平面几何特性考虑不足。

Method: 采用Transformer编码器-解码器框架，使用可学习的平面查询分层预测平面实例掩码；设计边缘感知掩码模块(EAMM)融入平面几何先验；提出自适应加权掩码损失和平面几何损失约束网络训练。

Result: 开发了RoofSeg网络，实现了真正端到端的屋顶平面分割，提高了边缘区域的判别性和分割精度。

Conclusion: RoofSeg通过结合Transformer架构、边缘感知模块和几何约束，有效解决了当前深度学习方法在屋顶平面分割中的三个关键问题，提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Roof plane segmentation is one of the key procedures for reconstructing
three-dimensional (3D) building models at levels of detail (LoD) 2 and 3 from
airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. The majority of
current approaches for roof plane segmentation rely on the manually designed or
learned features followed by some specifically designed geometric clustering
strategies. Because the learned features are more powerful than the manually
designed features, the deep learning-based approaches usually perform better
than the traditional approaches. However, the current deep learning-based
approaches have three unsolved problems. The first is that most of them are not
truly end-to-end, the plane segmentation results may be not optimal. The second
is that the point feature discriminability near the edges is relatively low,
leading to inaccurate planar edges. The third is that the planar geometric
characteristics are not sufficiently considered to constrain the network
training. To solve these issues, a novel edge-aware transformer-based network,
named RoofSeg, is developed for segmenting roof planes from LiDAR point clouds
in a truly end-to-end manner. In the RoofSeg, we leverage a transformer
encoder-decoder-based framework to hierarchically predict the plane instance
masks with the use of a set of learnable plane queries. To further improve the
segmentation accuracy of edge regions, we also design an Edge-Aware Mask Module
(EAMM) that sufficiently incorporates planar geometric prior of edges to
enhance its discriminability for plane instance mask refinement. In addition,
we propose an adaptive weighting strategy in the mask loss to reduce the
influence of misclassified points, and also propose a new plane geometric loss
to constrain the network training.

*Riju Marwah,Riya Arora,Navneet Yadav,Himank Arora*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MicroDetect-Net模型，结合荧光显微镜、尼罗红染色和深度学习技术，用于检测血液样本中的微塑料，准确率达到92%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着全球每年塑料产量超过3.68亿吨，微塑料污染日益严重，已在大气、水体、土壤和生物体中广泛检测到。微塑料对人体健康造成肝损伤、肠道损伤和肠道菌群失衡等危害，需要有效的检测方法

Method: 使用尼罗红染料染色和荧光显微镜技术，结合卷积神经网络进行图像分割，开发了MicroDetect-Net模型来定位和计数血液样本中的微塑料碎片

Result: 在276张尼罗红染色荧光血液图像数据集上，模型达到92%的准确率，IoU为87.4%，F1分数92.1%，精确率90.6%，召回率93.7%

Conclusion: MDN模型在微塑料检测方面表现出色，虽然使用蛤血样本存在局限性，但为应用于更一致的人类样本提供了初步数据收集的有效方法

Abstract: With the prevalence of plastics exceeding 368 million tons yearly,
microplastic pollution has grown to an extent where air, water, soil, and
living organisms have all tested positive for microplastic presence. These
particles, which are smaller than 5 millimeters in size, are no less harmful to
humans than to the environment. Toxicity research on microplastics has shown
that exposure may cause liver infection, intestinal injuries, and gut flora
imbalance, leading to numerous potential health hazards. This paper presents a
new model, MicroDetect-Net (MDN), which applies fluorescence microscopy with
Nile Red dye staining and deep learning to scan blood samples for
microplastics. Although clam blood has certain limitations in replicating real
human blood, this study opens avenues for applying the approach to human
samples, which are more consistent for preliminary data collection. The MDN
model integrates dataset preparation, fluorescence imaging, and segmentation
using a convolutional neural network to localize and count microplastic
fragments. The combination of convolutional networks and Nile Red dye for
segmentation produced strong image detection and accuracy. MDN was evaluated on
a dataset of 276 Nile Red-stained fluorescent blood images and achieved an
accuracy of ninety two percent. Robust performance was observed with an
Intersection over Union of 87.4 percent, F1 score of 92.1 percent, Precision of
90.6 percent, and Recall of 93.7 percent. These metrics demonstrate the
effectiveness of MDN in the detection of microplastics.

TL;DR: ProPy是一个基于CLIP的模型，通过提示金字塔结构和祖先-后代交互机制，在部分相关视频检索任务中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PRVR方法主要处理单模态特征，而强大的预训练视觉-语言模型如CLIP在该领域尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出ProPy模型，采用提示金字塔结构组织多粒度事件提示，并构建祖先-后代交互机制实现事件间的动态语义交互。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上达到SOTA性能，显著超越先前模型。

Conclusion: ProPy通过系统性地适配CLIP架构，成功解决了PRVR任务中的多粒度语义捕获问题。

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) is a practical yet challenging task
that involves retrieving videos based on queries relevant to only specific
segments. While existing works follow the paradigm of developing models to
process unimodal features, powerful pretrained vision-language models like CLIP
remain underexplored in this field. To bridge this gap, we propose ProPy, a
model with systematic architectural adaption of CLIP specifically designed for
PRVR. Drawing insights from the semantic relevance of multi-granularity events,
ProPy introduces two key innovations: (1) A Prompt Pyramid structure that
organizes event prompts to capture semantics at multiple granularity levels,
and (2) An Ancestor-Descendant Interaction Mechanism built on the pyramid that
enables dynamic semantic interaction among events. With these designs, ProPy
achieves SOTA performance on three public datasets, outperforming previous
models by significant margins. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用大规模几何血管模型数据集进行自监督预训练，提升冠状动脉壁剪切应力评估的准确性，即使在有限临床数据下也能改善血流动力学生物标志物的分割效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗大数据在心血管健康等领域具有巨大潜力，但获取足够大的数据集来训练机器学习模型评估血流动力学生物标志物（如壁剪切应力）极具挑战性。冠状动脉领域尚未充分研究如何利用学习表示来改进血流动力学评估。

Method: 使用包含8449个3D血管几何模型的大规模数据集进行自监督预训练，通过计算热核签名（基于拉普拉斯特征向量）创建自监督目标，学习几何表示，并将其应用于小规模临床试验（49名患者）的冠状动脉壁剪切应力评估。

Result: 研究表明，从大规模几何数据集中学习到的几何表示能够显著提升冠状动脉壁剪切应力区域（低、中、高时间平均壁剪切应力）的分割效果，即使在有限数据条件下训练也能获得良好性能。

Conclusion: 通过自监督预训练和基础模型，可以利用大规模几何血管数据集来解决临床数据稀缺问题，有效改进冠状动脉血流动力学生物标志物的评估准确性，为医疗大数据在心血管领域的应用提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Leveraging big data for patient care is promising in many medical fields such
as cardiovascular health. For example, hemodynamic biomarkers like wall shear
stress could be assessed from patient-specific medical images via machine
learning algorithms, bypassing the need for time-intensive computational fluid
simulation. However, it is extremely challenging to amass large-enough datasets
to effectively train such models. We could address this data scarcity by means
of self-supervised pre-training and foundations models given large datasets of
geometric artery models. In the context of coronary arteries, leveraging
learned representations to improve hemodynamic biomarker assessment has not yet
been well studied. In this work, we address this gap by investigating whether a
large dataset (8449 shapes) consisting of geometric models of 3D blood vessels
can benefit wall shear stress assessment in coronary artery models from a
small-scale clinical trial (49 patients). We create a self-supervised target
for the 3D blood vessels by computing the heat kernel signature, a quantity
obtained via Laplacian eigenvectors, which captures the very essence of the
shapes. We show how geometric representations learned from this datasets can
boost segmentation of coronary arteries into regions of low, mid and high
(time-averaged) wall shear stress even when trained on limited data.

TL;DR: SuperSimpleNet是一个高效、适应性强的表面缺陷检测模型，能够在四种不同的监督场景（无监督、弱监督、混合监督和全监督）下进行训练，在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，同时推理时间低于10毫秒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的表面缺陷检测方法往往局限于特定的监督场景，难以适应真实制造过程中多样化的数据标注需求，无法满足工业对高性能、高效率和强适应性的要求。

Method: 基于SimpleNet构建，引入了新颖的合成异常生成过程、增强的分类头和改进的学习过程，能够在所有四种监督场景下进行高效训练。

Result: 在四个具有挑战性的基准数据集上均达到了最先进的性能水平，推理时间低于10毫秒，是第一个能够充分利用所有可用数据标注的模型。

Conclusion: SuperSimpleNet通过统一不同的监督范式，在保持出色速度和可靠性的同时，为解决真实制造挑战和弥合学术研究与工业应用之间的差距迈出了有希望的一步。

Abstract: Surface defect detection is a critical task across numerous industries, aimed
at efficiently identifying and localising imperfections or irregularities on
manufactured components. While numerous methods have been proposed, many fail
to meet industrial demands for high performance, efficiency, and adaptability.
Existing approaches are often constrained to specific supervision scenarios and
struggle to adapt to the diverse data annotations encountered in real-world
manufacturing processes, such as unsupervised, weakly supervised, mixed
supervision, and fully supervised settings. To address these challenges, we
propose SuperSimpleNet, a highly efficient and adaptable discriminative model
built on the foundation of SimpleNet. SuperSimpleNet incorporates a novel
synthetic anomaly generation process, an enhanced classification head, and an
improved learning procedure, enabling efficient training in all four
supervision scenarios, making it the first model capable of fully leveraging
all available data annotations. SuperSimpleNet sets a new standard for
performance across all scenarios, as demonstrated by its results on four
challenging benchmark datasets. Beyond accuracy, it is very fast, achieving an
inference time below 10 ms. With its ability to unify diverse supervision
paradigms while maintaining outstanding speed and reliability, SuperSimpleNet
represents a promising step forward in addressing real-world manufacturing
challenges and bridging the gap between academic research and industrial
applications. Code: https://github.com/blaz-r/SuperSimpleNet

Motivation: 单像素成像通过结构化光模式序列照明实现单探测器物体重建，但需要优化任务特定的二值照明模式以提高重建质量

bilevel optimisation method for learning task-specific, binary illumination
patterns, optimised for applications like single-pixel fluorescence microscopy.
We address the non-differentiable nature of binary pattern optimisation using
the Straight-Through Estimator and leveraging a Total Deep Variation
regulariser in the bilevel formulation. We demonstrate our method on the
CytoImageNet microscopy dataset and show that learned patterns achieve superior
reconstruction performance compared to baseline methods, especially in highly
undersampled regimes.

TL;DR: 通过采用简单的旋转不平衡质量产生周期性震动，解决事件相机在静态场景中无法产生事件的问题，结合运动补偿管线实现清晰的下游感知任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机在固定照明条件和静态/低运动场景不能产生事件，限制了其在计算机视觉任务中的应用。现有方法需要复杂硬件或额外光学组件。

Method: 设计轻量级方案：使用旋转不平衡质量产生周期性震动，结合运动补偿管线去除注入的运动，产生干净的运动校正事件。

Result: 在实际采集的数据集上验证，方法可靠恢复运动参数，在图像重建和边缘检测任务上都超过了无运动引导的事件感知。

Conclusion: 该方法通过简单硬件和算法组合，有效解决了事件相机在静态场景中的限制，提高了下游感知任务的性能。

Abstract: Event cameras are a bio-inspired class of sensors that asynchronously measure
per-pixel intensity changes. Under fixed illumination conditions in static or
low-motion scenes, rigidly mounted event cameras are unable to generate any
events, becoming unsuitable for most computer vision tasks. To address this
limitation, recent work has investigated motion-induced event stimulation that
often requires complex hardware or additional optical components. In contrast,
we introduce a lightweight approach to sustain persistent event generation by
employing a simple rotating unbalanced mass to induce periodic vibrational
motion. This is combined with a motion-compensation pipeline that removes the
injected motion and yields clean, motion-corrected events for downstream
perception tasks. We demonstrate our approach with a hardware prototype and
evaluate it on real-world captured datasets. Our method reliably recovers
motion parameters and improves both image reconstruction and edge detection
over event-based sensing without motion induction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种轻量级的几点学习方法，通过结合UNet++网络和拓扑感知损失函数，在只需三个注释页面的情况下实现了历史文档文本行分割的高精度识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史文档的文本行分割需要大量注释数据，而注释过程苦难且成本高，因此需要小样本学习方法来降低数据需求。

Method: 采用轻量级UNet++网络结构，结合一种为神经形态学设计的连通性感知损失函数，显式惩罚线段碎片化和错误合并等结构错误。从每个手稿仅提取三个注释页面的小补丁进行训练。

Result: 在U-DIADS-TL数据集上识别精度提高了200%，行交叉比提高了75%，在DIVA-HisDB基准检测任务中达到或超过竞赛胜者的F-Measure分数。

Conclusion: 这种简单而高效的方法在极少的注释数据下实现了历史文档文本行分割的突破性性能改善，为少量样本学习领域提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: A foundational task for the digital analysis of documents is text line
segmentation. However, automating this process with deep learning models is
challenging because it requires large, annotated datasets that are often
unavailable for historical documents. Additionally, the annotation process is a
labor- and cost-intensive task that requires expert knowledge, which makes
few-shot learning a promising direction for reducing data requirements. In this
work, we demonstrate that small and simple architectures, coupled with a
topology-aware loss function, are more accurate and data-efficient than more
complex alternatives. We pair a lightweight UNet++ with a connectivity-aware
loss, initially developed for neuron morphology, which explicitly penalizes
structural errors like line fragmentation and unintended line merges. To
increase our limited data, we train on small patches extracted from a mere
three annotated pages per manuscript. Our methodology significantly improves
upon the current state-of-the-art on the U-DIADS-TL dataset, with a 200%
increase in Recognition Accuracy and a 75% increase in Line Intersection over
Union. Our method also achieves an F-Measure score on par with or even
exceeding that of the competition winner of the DIVA-HisDB baseline detection
task, all while requiring only three annotated pages, exemplifying the efficacy
of our approach. Our implementation is publicly available at:

TL;DR: 本文针对单目3D视觉定位任务中预训练语言模型对数值单位不敏感的问题，提出了两种增强方法：3D文本增强(3DTE)和文本引导几何增强(TGE)，在Mono3DRefer数据集上取得了11.94%的显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现文本嵌入对数值大小敏感但忽略测量单位，导致即使物理长度相同，单位变化也会造成性能严重下降，这表明预训练语言模型的3D理解能力较弱。

Method: 提出3D文本增强(3DTE)通过增加距离描述符多样性来增强单位映射关系理解；提出文本引导几何增强(TGE)模块将文本特征投影到几何一致空间，并用增强后的文本特征精确引导几何特征的注意力。

Result: 在Mono3DRefer数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比之前方法有显著改进，在"Far"场景中实现了11.94%的准确率提升，达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 通过增强文本嵌入的3D感知能力和几何特征，有效解决了单位敏感性问题，显著提升了单目3D视觉定位任务的性能。

Abstract: Monocular 3D visual grounding is a novel task that aims to locate 3D objects
in RGB images using text descriptions with explicit geometry information.
Despite the inclusion of geometry details in the text, we observe that the text
embeddings are sensitive to the magnitude of numerical values but largely
ignore the associated measurement units. For example, simply equidistant
mapping the length with unit "meter" to "decimeters" or "centimeters" leads to
severe performance degradation, even though the physical length remains
equivalent. This observation signifies the weak 3D comprehension of pre-trained
language model, which generates misguiding text features to hinder 3D
perception. Therefore, we propose to enhance the 3D perception of model on text
embeddings and geometry features with two simple and effective methods.
Firstly, we introduce a pre-processing method named 3D-text Enhancement (3DTE),
which enhances the comprehension of mapping relationships between different
units by augmenting the diversity of distance descriptors in text queries.
Next, we propose a Text-Guided Geometry Enhancement (TGE) module to further
enhance the 3D-text information by projecting the basic text features into
geometrically consistent space. These 3D-enhanced text features are then
leveraged to precisely guide the attention of geometry features. We evaluate
the proposed method through extensive comparisons and ablation studies on the
Mono3DRefer dataset. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements
over previous methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results with a notable
accuracy gain of 11.94\% in the "Far" scenario. Our code will be made publicly
available.

Motivation: 传统Vision Transformer的位置编码方法破坏了图像的二维空间结构，缺乏几何约束，无法有效利用空间邻近先验

Method: 基于Weierstrass椭圆函数的位置编码(WEF-PE)，通过复数域表示直接处理二维坐标，利用椭圆函数的双周期性和非线性几何特性编码空间距离关系

Result: 在CIFAR-100上ViT-Tiny从头训练达到63.78%准确率，ViT-Base微调达到93.28%，在VTAB-1k基准任务上持续改进，理论分析和注意力可视化验证了方法的有效性

Conclusion: WEF-PE为Vision Transformer提供了数学原理严谨的位置编码方法，能够更好地保持图像空间结构，增强几何归纳偏置，提升模型性能

Abstract: Vision Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in computer vision
tasks, yet their reliance on learnable one-dimensional positional embeddings
fundamentally disrupts the inherent two-dimensional spatial structure of images
through patch flattening procedures. Traditional positional encoding approaches
lack geometric constraints and fail to establish monotonic correspondence
between Euclidean spatial distances and sequential index distances, thereby
limiting the model's capacity to leverage spatial proximity priors effectively.
We propose Weierstrass Elliptic Function Positional Encoding (WEF-PE), a
mathematically principled approach that directly addresses two-dimensional
coordinates through natural complex domain representation, where the doubly
periodic properties of elliptic functions align remarkably with translational
invariance patterns commonly observed in visual data. Our method exploits the
non-linear geometric nature of elliptic functions to encode spatial distance
relationships naturally, while the algebraic addition formula enables direct
derivation of relative positional information between arbitrary patch pairs
from their absolute encodings. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
WEF-PE achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios, including
63.78\% accuracy on CIFAR-100 from-scratch training with ViT-Tiny architecture,
93.28\% on CIFAR-100 fine-tuning with ViT-Base, and consistent improvements on
VTAB-1k benchmark tasks. Theoretical analysis confirms the distance-decay
property through rigorous mathematical proof, while attention visualization
reveals enhanced geometric inductive bias and more coherent semantic focus
compared to conventional approaches.The source code implementing the methods
described in this paper is publicly available on GitHub.

Motivation: 传统的网格生成方法将三角网格转换为序列化令牌，但因为顶点被多个面共享而导致重复编码，产生过长的令牌序列和效率低下的生成过程

Method: 使用自回归模型生成顶点（减少到23%令牌），然后用双向Transformer捕捉顶点关系并构建邻接矩阵来完成面片生成，添加保真增强器精细顶点位置，并通过后处理去除不良边缘连接

Result: 网格生成速度提升8倍以上，同时产生更高质量的网格

Conclusion: 该方法通过分离顶点和面片生成，有效解决了网格令牌化中的重复性问题，在提高效率的同时保持了生成质量

Abstract: Recent mesh generation approaches typically tokenize triangle meshes into
sequences of tokens and train autoregressive models to generate these tokens
sequentially. Despite substantial progress, such token sequences inevitably
reuse vertices multiple times to fully represent manifold meshes, as each
vertex is shared by multiple faces. This redundancy leads to excessively long
token sequences and inefficient generation processes. In this paper, we propose
an efficient framework that generates artistic meshes by treating vertices and
faces separately, significantly reducing redundancy. We employ an
autoregressive model solely for vertex generation, decreasing the token count
to approximately 23\% of that required by the most compact existing tokenizer.
Next, we leverage a bidirectional transformer to complete the mesh in a single
step by capturing inter-vertex relationships and constructing the adjacency
matrix that defines the mesh faces. To further improve the generation quality,
we introduce a fidelity enhancer to refine vertex positioning into more natural
arrangements and propose a post-processing framework to remove undesirable edge
connections. Experimental results show that our method achieves more than
8$\times$ faster speed on mesh generation compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, while producing higher mesh quality.

Result: 实验表明该方法能实现精确且可扩展的属性操控，相比之前方法有显著提升，并能与反演框架结合处理真实图像。

Conclusion: All-in-One Slider解决了现有方法的参数冗余和扩展性问题，为T2I扩散模型提供了灵活、可扩展的属性控制方案，具有广泛的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant strides in
generating high-quality images. However, progressively manipulating certain
attributes of generated images to meet the desired user expectations remains
challenging, particularly for content with rich details, such as human faces.
Some studies have attempted to address this by training slider modules.
However, they follow a One-for-One manner, where an independent slider is
trained for each attribute, requiring additional training whenever a new
attribute is introduced. This not only results in parameter redundancy
accumulated by sliders but also restricts the flexibility of practical
applications and the scalability of attribute manipulation. To address this
issue, we introduce the All-in-One Slider, a lightweight module that decomposes
the text embedding space into sparse, semantically meaningful attribute
directions. Once trained, it functions as a general-purpose slider, enabling
interpretable and fine-grained continuous control over various attributes.
Moreover, by recombining the learned directions, the All-in-One Slider supports
zero-shot manipulation of unseen attributes (e.g., races and celebrities) and
the composition of multiple attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method enables accurate and scalable attribute manipulation, achieving
notable improvements compared to previous methods. Furthermore, our method can
be extended to integrate with the inversion framework to perform attribute
manipulation on real images, broadening its applicability to various real-world
scenarios. The code and trained model will be released at:

Motivation: 现有神经重建方法只能处理静态环境且场景控制有限，而图像/视频涵渗模型生成的驾驶数据缺乏几何基础和因果性。需要找到一种方法来突破这些限制。

Method: 结合代理几何结构和环境表示的生成，使用从学习到的2D图像先验中识别分数来实现高质量的3D场景生成。

Abstract: Large-scale scene data is essential for training and testing in robot
learning. Neural reconstruction methods have promised the capability of
reconstructing large physically-grounded outdoor scenes from captured sensor
data. However, these methods have baked-in static environments and only allow
for limited scene control -- they are functionally constrained in scene and
trajectory diversity by the captures from which they are reconstructed. In
contrast, generating driving data with recent image or video diffusion models
offers control, however, at the cost of geometry grounding and causality. In
this work, we aim to bridge this gap and present a method that directly
generates large-scale 3D driving scenes with accurate geometry, allowing for
causal novel view synthesis with object permanence and explicit 3D geometry
estimation. The proposed method combines the generation of a proxy geometry and
environment representation with score distillation from learned 2D image
priors. We find that this approach allows for high controllability, enabling
the prompt-guided geometry and high-fidelity texture and structure that can be
conditioned on map layouts -- producing realistic and geometrically consistent
3D generations of complex driving scenes.

Motivation: 现有视频角色模型只能产生物理相似的动作，但缺乏对情感、意图和上下文的深层语义理解，通常只与音频节奏等低级线索同步，无法捕捉角色的真实本质。

Method: 1. 利用多模态大语言模型合成结构化文本表示，提供高级语义指导；2. 引入专门的Multimodal DiT架构，采用新颖的Pseudo Last Frame设计，有效融合多模态输入并缓解模态间冲突。

Result: 模型在唇形同步准确性、视频质量、运动自然度和与文本提示的语义一致性等综合指标上达到领先性能，并能扩展到多人和非人类主体的复杂场景。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合高级语义指导和专门的多模态融合架构，成功生成了既物理合理又语义连贯的富有表现力的角色动画，在多个评估维度上表现优异。

Abstract: Existing video avatar models can produce fluid human animations, yet they
struggle to move beyond mere physical likeness to capture a character's
authentic essence. Their motions typically synchronize with low-level cues like
audio rhythm, lacking a deeper semantic understanding of emotion, intent, or
context. To bridge this gap, \textbf{we propose a framework designed to
generate character animations that are not only physically plausible but also
semantically coherent and expressive.} Our model, \textbf{OmniHuman-1.5}, is
built upon two key technical contributions. First, we leverage Multimodal Large
Language Models to synthesize a structured textual representation of conditions
that provides high-level semantic guidance. This guidance steers our motion
generator beyond simplistic rhythmic synchronization, enabling the production
of actions that are contextually and emotionally resonant. Second, to ensure
the effective fusion of these multimodal inputs and mitigate inter-modality
conflicts, we introduce a specialized Multimodal DiT architecture with a novel
Pseudo Last Frame design. The synergy of these components allows our model to
accurately interpret the joint semantics of audio, images, and text, thereby
generating motions that are deeply coherent with the character, scene, and
linguistic content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves
leading performance across a comprehensive set of metrics, including lip-sync
accuracy, video quality, motion naturalness and semantic consistency with
textual prompts. Furthermore, our approach shows remarkable extensibility to
complex scenarios, such as those involving multi-person and non-human subjects.

TL;DR: VFTrack是一个实时原位粒子跟踪框架，用于自动检测和跟踪SEM图像序列中的碳纳米管颗粒，解决了现有方法只能静态分析或缺乏连续轨迹分解的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 碳纳米管动态生长的表征受到扫描电子显微镜成像中纳米级运动测量实验挑战的限制，现有方法只能提供静态分析或需要手动初始化且缺乏连续的单粒子轨迹分解。

Method: VFTrack集成了手工制作或深度特征检测器和匹配器，在粒子跟踪框架内实现碳纳米管微柱生长的运动学分析。通过13,540条手动标注轨迹的系统性评估，确定了ALIKED检测器与LightGlue匹配器的最优组合。

Result: VFTrack实现了F1分数0.78和α分数0.89的优异性能，能够将运动矢量分解为轴向生长、横向漂移和振荡，有助于计算异质区域生长速率和重建演化的碳纳米管柱形态。

Conclusion: 这项工作推动了自动化纳米材料表征的进步，弥合了基于物理的模型与实验观察之间的差距，实现了碳纳米管合成的实时优化。

Abstract: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are critical building blocks in nanotechnology, yet
the characterization of their dynamic growth is limited by the experimental
challenges in nanoscale motion measurement using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) imaging. Existing ex situ methods offer only static analysis, while in
situ techniques often require manual initialization and lack continuous
per-particle trajectory decomposition. We present Visual Feature Tracking
(VFTrack) an in-situ real-time particle tracking framework that automatically
detects and tracks individual CNT particles in SEM image sequences. VFTrack
integrates handcrafted or deep feature detectors and matchers within a particle
tracking framework to enable kinematic analysis of CNT micropillar growth. A
systematic using 13,540 manually annotated trajectories identifies the ALIKED
detector with LightGlue matcher as an optimal combination (F1-score of 0.78,
$\alpha$-score of 0.89). VFTrack motion vectors decomposed into axial growth,
lateral drift, and oscillations, facilitate the calculation of heterogeneous
regional growth rates and the reconstruction of evolving CNT pillar
morphologies. This work enables advancement in automated nano-material
characterization, bridging the gap between physics-based models and
experimental observation to enable real-time optimization of CNT synthesis.

Motivation: 当前视频分割领域存在碎片化问题，提示分割和无提示分割需要不同的模型和流水线，缺乏统一的解决方案

Method: 将流式视频分割重新定义为序列掩码预测问题，构建基于状态空间模型的AUSM架构，维护固定大小的空间状态并支持任意长度视频流，所有组件都设计为跨帧并行训练

Result: 在DAVIS17、YouTube-VOS、MOSE、YouTube-VIS、OVIS等标准基准测试中优于之前的通用流式视频分割方法，16帧序列训练速度提升2.5倍

Conclusion: AUSM成功统一了提示和无提示视频分割任务，证明了序列掩码预测方法的有效性，同时通过并行训练设计显著提升了训练效率

Abstract: Recent video foundation models such as SAM2 excel at prompted video
segmentation by treating masks as a general-purpose primitive. However, many
real-world settings require unprompted segmentation that aims to detect and
track all objects in a video without external cues, leaving today's landscape
fragmented across task-specific models and pipelines. We recast streaming video
segmentation as sequential mask prediction, analogous to language modeling, and
introduce the Autoregressive Universal Segmentation Model (AUSM), a single
architecture that unifies both prompted and unprompted video segmentation.
Built on recent state-space models, AUSM maintains a fixed-size spatial state
and scales to video streams of arbitrary length. Furthermore, all components of
AUSM are designed for parallel training across frames, yielding substantial
speedups over iterative training. On standard benchmarks (DAVIS17, YouTube-VOS
2018 & 2019, MOSE, YouTube-VIS 2019 & 2021, and OVIS) AUSM outperforms prior
universal streaming video segmentation methods and achieves up to 2.5x faster
training on 16-frame sequences.

Conclusion: Style4D-Bench将成为动态3D场景风格化渲染研究的有价值资源，推动该领域发展

Abstract: We introduce Style4D-Bench, the first benchmark suite specifically designed
for 4D stylization, with the goal of standardizing evaluation and facilitating
progress in this emerging area. Style4D-Bench comprises: 1) a comprehensive
evaluation protocol measuring spatial fidelity, temporal coherence, and
multi-view consistency through both perceptual and quantitative metrics, 2) a
strong baseline that make an initial attempt for 4D stylization, and 3) a
curated collection of high-resolution dynamic 4D scenes with diverse motions
and complex backgrounds. To establish a strong baseline, we present Style4D, a
novel framework built upon 4D Gaussian Splatting. It consists of three key
components: a basic 4DGS scene representation to capture reliable geometry, a
Style Gaussian Representation that leverages lightweight per-Gaussian MLPs for
temporally and spatially aware appearance control, and a Holistic
Geometry-Preserved Style Transfer module designed to enhance spatio-temporal
consistency via contrastive coherence learning and structural content
preservation. Extensive experiments on Style4D-Bench demonstrate that Style4D
achieves state-of-the-art performance in 4D stylization, producing fine-grained
stylistic details with stable temporal dynamics and consistent multi-view
rendering. We expect Style4D-Bench to become a valuable resource for
benchmarking and advancing research in stylized rendering of dynamic 3D scenes.

TL;DR: Articulate3D是一个无需训练的方法，通过语言控制来调整3D资产的姿态。该方法使用改进的图像生成器创建目标图像，并通过多视角姿态优化将网格对齐到目标图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉和语言模型有所进展，但通过语言控制来调整3D资产姿态的任务仍然具有挑战性。需要一种能够保持网格原始身份的同时实现自由姿态操纵的方法。

Method: 将问题分解为两个步骤：1）使用自注意力重连机制（RSActrl）改进图像生成器，在保持结构一致性的同时生成不同姿态的目标图像；2）通过关键点建立输入图像与目标图像之间的对应关系，进行多视角姿态优化，而不是使用可微分渲染。

Result: 该方法在多种3D对象和自由形式文本提示下都表现出色，成功操纵姿态的同时保持了网格的原始身份。定量评估和用户研究表明，该方法在85%的情况下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Articulate3D提供了一种有效的训练自由方法，通过语言指令实现3D资产的姿态控制，解决了现有方法在保持身份一致性和姿态操纵方面的挑战。

Abstract: We propose a training-free method, Articulate3D, to pose a 3D asset through
language control. Despite advances in vision and language models, this task
remains surprisingly challenging. To achieve this goal, we decompose the
problem into two steps. We modify a powerful image-generator to create target
images conditioned on the input image and a text instruction. We then align the
mesh to the target images through a multi-view pose optimisation step. In
detail, we introduce a self-attention rewiring mechanism (RSActrl) that
decouples the source structure from pose within an image generative model,
allowing it to maintain a consistent structure across varying poses. We
observed that differentiable rendering is an unreliable signal for articulation
optimisation; instead, we use keypoints to establish correspondences between
input and target images. The effectiveness of Articulate3D is demonstrated
across a diverse range of 3D objects and free-form text prompts, successfully
manipulating poses while maintaining the original identity of the mesh.
Quantitative evaluations and a comparative user study, in which our method was
preferred over 85\% of the time, confirm its superiority over existing
approaches. Project page:https://odeb1.github.io/articulate3d_page_deb/

Motivation: 现有方法通过编辑多视角图像再重建3D模型，难以精确保持未编辑区域的完整性和整体一致性，需要一种更精确的3D编辑方法。

Method: 首先预测3D模型的反向轨迹获取各时间步的反向潜在表示和键值令牌，在去噪编辑阶段用这些特征替换保留区域的去噪特征，确保未编辑区域的一致性重建。

Result: 在Edit3D-Bench数据集上的实验表明，VoxHammer在保留区域的3D一致性和整体质量方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为合成高质量编辑配对数据提供了有效解决方案，为上下文3D生成奠定了数据基础。

Abstract: 3D local editing of specified regions is crucial for game industry and robot
interaction. Recent methods typically edit rendered multi-view images and then
reconstruct 3D models, but they face challenges in precisely preserving
unedited regions and overall coherence. Inspired by structured 3D generative
models, we propose VoxHammer, a novel training-free approach that performs
precise and coherent editing in 3D latent space. Given a 3D model, VoxHammer
first predicts its inversion trajectory and obtains its inverted latents and
key-value tokens at each timestep. Subsequently, in the denoising and editing
phase, we replace the denoising features of preserved regions with the
corresponding inverted latents and cached key-value tokens. By retaining these
contextual features, this approach ensures consistent reconstruction of
preserved areas and coherent integration of edited parts. To evaluate the
consistency of preserved regions, we constructed Edit3D-Bench, a
human-annotated dataset comprising hundreds of samples, each with carefully
labeled 3D editing regions. Experiments demonstrate that VoxHammer
significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both 3D consistency of
preserved regions and overall quality. Our method holds promise for
synthesizing high-quality edited paired data, thereby laying the data
foundation for in-context 3D generation. See our project page at

Conclusion: 真正意义产生于向语义连贯性的递归收敛而非模拟，这需要设计用于塑造语言而不仅仅是预测语言的全新认知架构

Abstract: This essay develops a theoretical framework for a semantic Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI) based on the notion of semantic attractors in complex-valued
meaning spaces. Departing from current transformer-based language models, which
operate on statistical next-token prediction, we explore a model in which
meaning is not inferred probabilistically but formed through recursive
tensorial transformation. Using cyclic operations involving the imaginary unit
\emph{i}, we describe a rotational semantic structure capable of modeling
irony, homonymy, and ambiguity. At the center of this model, however, is a
semantic attractor -- a teleological operator that, unlike statistical
computation, acts as an intentional agent (Microvitum), guiding meaning toward
stability, clarity, and expressive depth. Conceived in terms of gradient flows,
tensor deformations, and iterative matrix dynamics, the attractor offers a
model of semantic transformation that is not only mathematically suggestive,
but also philosophically significant. We argue that true meaning emerges not
from simulation, but from recursive convergence toward semantic coherence, and
that this requires a fundamentally new kind of cognitive architecture -- one
designed to shape language, not just predict it.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems
(MAS) as components of collaborative intelligence, where peer interactions
dynamically shape individual decision-making. Although prior work has focused
on conformity bias, we extend the analysis to examine how LLMs form trust from
previous impressions, resist misinformation, and integrate peer input during
interaction, key factors for achieving collective intelligence under complex
social dynamics. We present KAIROS, a benchmark simulating quiz contests with
peer agents of varying reliability, offering fine-grained control over
conditions such as expert-novice roles, noisy crowds, and adversarial peers.
LLMs receive both historical interactions and current peer responses, allowing
systematic investigation into how trust, peer action, and self-confidence
influence decisions. As for mitigation strategies, we evaluate prompting,
supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, Group Relative Policy
Optimisation (GRPO), across multiple models. Our results reveal that GRPO with
multi-agent context combined with outcome-based rewards and unconstrained
reasoning achieves the best overall performance, but also decreases the
robustness to social influence compared to Base models. The code and datasets

Abstract: English is the predominant language on the web, powering nearly half of the
world's top ten million websites. Support for multilingual content is
nevertheless growing, with many websites increasingly combining English with
regional or native languages in both visible content and hidden metadata. This
multilingualism introduces significant barriers for users with visual
impairments, as assistive technologies like screen readers frequently lack
robust support for non-Latin scripts and misrender or mispronounce non-English
text, compounding accessibility challenges across diverse linguistic contexts.
Yet, large-scale studies of this issue have been limited by the lack of
comprehensive datasets on multilingual web content. To address this gap, we
introduce LangCrUX, the first large-scale dataset of 120,000 popular websites
across 12 languages that primarily use non-Latin scripts. Leveraging this
dataset, we conduct a systematic analysis of multilingual web accessibility and
uncover widespread neglect of accessibility hints. We find that these hints
often fail to reflect the language diversity of visible content, reducing the
effectiveness of screen readers and limiting web accessibility. We finally
propose Kizuki, a language-aware automated accessibility testing extension to
account for the limited utility of language-inconsistent accessibility hints.

Abstract: The effectiveness of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) prompting is often
limited by the use of randomly or manually selected examples. These examples
fail to account for both model-specific knowledge distributions and the
intrinsic complexity of the tasks, resulting in suboptimal and unstable model
performance. To address this, we propose a novel framework inspired by the
pedagogical principle of "tailored teaching with balanced difficulty". We
reframe prompt selection as a prompt curriculum design problem: constructing a
well ordered set of training examples that align with the model's current
capabilities. Our approach integrates two complementary signals: (1)
model-perceived difficulty, quantified through prediction disagreement in an
active learning setup, capturing what the model itself finds challenging; and
(2) intrinsic sample complexity, which measures the inherent difficulty of each
question-image pair independently of any model. By jointly analyzing these
signals, we develop a difficulty-balanced sampling strategy that ensures the
selected prompt examples are diverse across both dimensions. Extensive
experiments conducted on five challenging benchmarks and multiple popular
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate that our method yields
substantial and consistent improvements and greatly reduces performance
discrepancies caused by random sampling, providing a principled and robust
approach for enhancing multimodal reasoning.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多语言能力上存在不平衡问题，研究发现多语言理解能力与浅层语言特定神经元激活存在显著相关性

Method: 首先通过监控语言特定神经元激活来识别参与多语言理解的层，然后使用问题翻译对精确微调这些层以实现多语言对齐

Result: 在MM-Bench和MMMB基准测试中有效提升了多语言能力，仅微调14%参数就实现了显著效率

Conclusion: PLAST方法可推广到低资源和复杂视觉推理任务，促进浅层语言特定视觉信息参与，为多语言视觉语言模型提供高效训练方案

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated exceptional
capabilities in understanding visual information with human languages but also
exhibit an imbalance in multilingual capabilities. In this work, we delve into
the multilingual working pattern of LVLMs and identify a salient correlation
between the multilingual understanding ability of LVLMs and language-specific
neuron activations in shallow layers. Building on this insight, we introduce
PLAST, a training recipe that achieves efficient multilingual enhancement for
LVLMs by Precise LAnguage-Specific layers fine-Tuning. PLAST first identifies
layers involved in multilingual understanding by monitoring language-specific
neuron activations. These layers are then precisely fine-tuned with
question-translation pairs to achieve multilingual alignment. Our empirical
results on MM-Bench and MMMB demonstrate that PLAST effectively improves the
multilingual capabilities of LVLMs and achieves significant efficiency with
only 14% of the parameters tuned. Further analysis reveals that PLAST can be
generalized to low-resource and complex visual reasoning tasks, facilitating
the language-specific visual information engagement in shallow layers.

TL;DR: 使用backprompting方法生产生产级别标数据，通过稀疏人工聚类技术标注，构建代表性并行语料库，用于健康建议监管拦截器训练，效果超过GPT-4o 3.73%且参数量减少400倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业环境中大语言模型的普及带来风险，监管技术需要生产级别标数据来开发稳健检测器，但那些数据在部署前难以获得。

Method: 提出backprompting方法生产生产级别别标数据，结合稀疏人工聚类技术进行标注，构建与原始数据集并行但类似真实LLM输出的语料库，并将合成示例注入现有数据集以生产稳健训练数据。

Result: 在健康建议识别这个难度高、细微的监管任务中，检测器效果显著提升，超过GPT-4o达到3.73%，而参数数量仅为其的1/400。

Conclusion: backprompting方法能够有效生产生产级别别标数据，为监管检测器的开发提供了可靠的数据支撑，在保持高性能的同时显著提升了检测准确性。

Abstract: The pervasiveness of large language models (LLMs) in enterprise settings has
also brought forth a significant amount of risks associated with their usage.
Guardrails technologies aim to mitigate this risk by filtering LLMs'
input/output text through various detectors. However, developing and
maintaining robust detectors faces many challenges, one of which is the
difficulty in acquiring production-quality labeled data on real LLM outputs
prior to deployment. In this work, we propose backprompting, a simple yet
intuitive solution to generate production-like labeled data for health advice
guardrails development. Furthermore, we pair our backprompting method with a
sparse human-in-the-loop clustering technique to label the generated data. Our
aim is to construct a parallel corpus roughly representative of the original
dataset yet resembling real LLM output. We then infuse existing datasets with
our synthetic examples to produce robust training data for our detector. We
test our technique in one of the most difficult and nuanced guardrails: the
identification of health advice in LLM output, and demonstrate improvement
versus other solutions. Our detector is able to outperform GPT-4o by up to
3.73%, despite having 400x less parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决softmax自注意力机制中特殊令牌和标点符号等无信息令牌获得过多权重的问题（注意力噪声），同时避免现有负注意力方法丢弃有用信息的风险。

Method: 提出Integral Transformer自注意力机制，通过整合从logit分布中采样的信号来去噪注意力，平衡特殊令牌的贡献与噪声减少。

Result: 在成熟的知识和推理语言基准测试中优于vanilla、Cog和Differential注意力变体，有效平衡注意力分布并减少上层rank collapse。

Conclusion: Integral Transformer能有效去噪注意力同时保留关键信息，底层使用vanilla自注意力可提升性能，为Transformer架构提供了改进的注意力机制。

Abstract: Softmax self-attention often assigns disproportionate weight to semantically
uninformative tokens such as special tokens and punctuation, a phenomenon known
as attention noise. While recent methods like Cog Attention and the
Differential Transformer have addressed this by introducing negative attention
scores, they risk discarding useful information. In this paper, we propose the
Integral Transformer, a novel self-attention mechanism that denoises attention
by integrating signals sampled from the logit distribution. Our approach
mitigates noise while preserving the contributions of special tokens critical
for model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
outperforms vanilla, Cog, and Differential attention variants on
well-established knowledge and reasoning language benchmarks. Moreover, our
analysis reveals that employing vanilla self-attention in the lower Transformer
layers enhances performance and that the Integral Transformer effectively
balances attention distributions and reduces rank collapse in upper layers.

TL;DR: LSC通过可学习的词嵌入选择语义最一致的响应，在短式和长式推理基准测试中均优于现有方法，且计算开销可忽略


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM概率解码在复杂或长式问题上输出不一致的问题，现有方法在短式和长式回答格式间存在准确率权衡

Method: 使用可学习的词嵌入选择语义最一致的响应，通过轻量级前向生成摘要标记，推理时间增加不到1%且无需修改模型架构

Result: 在6个短式和5个长式推理基准测试中，LSC在所有测试上平均优于SC、USC和WUCS，同时保持可忽略的计算开销

Conclusion: LSC是一种实用的跨答案格式一致性选择方法，能提供良好校准的置信度估计，在两种答案格式上都保持低预期校准误差

Abstract: Probabilistic decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs) often yields
inconsistent outputs, particularly on complex or long-form questions.
Self-Consistency (SC) mitigates this for short-form QA by majority voting over
exact strings, whereas Universal Self-Consistency (USC) and Weighted Unigram
Consistency Score (WUCS) extend to long-form responses but lose accuracy on
short-form benchmarks.
  We introduce Latent Self-Consistency (LSC), which selects the most
semantically consistent response using learnable token embeddings. A
lightweight forward generation of summary tokens increases inference time by
less than 1% and requires no changes to the model architecture.
  Across 6 short-form and 5 long-form reasoning benchmarks (e.g., MATH, MMLU,
TruthfulQA), LSC surpasses SC, USC and WUCS on all short-form and long-form
ones on average, while maintaining negligible computational overhead. These
results position LSC as a practical consistency-selection method that works
reliably across answer formats. Additionally, LSC provides well-calibrated
confidence estimates, maintaining low Expected Calibration Error across both
answer formats.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文质疑当前AI模型在分布外(OOD)数据集上的评估方法，发现不同OOD数据集对模型快捷方式粘性的评估质量差异巨大，某些甚至较内部评估更差，提出了更稳健的法法论和建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI领域通过OOD数据集评估模型的普适性，但这种评估基于一个强假设：OOD评估能够抓住并反映真实部署中可能的失败模式。该研究质疑这一假设的有效性。

Method: 将OOD评估的结果与现有问答(QA)模型中记录的具体失败模式进行对比，重点关注模型对偏偏特征或预测快捷方式的依赖性。分析不同OOD数据集在评估模型快捷方式粘性方面的质量差异。

Result: 发现不同用于QA领域OOD评估的数据集提供的模型快捷方式粘性估计质量差异巨大，某些数据集的表现甚至较简单的内部分布评估更差。部分原因是偏偏快捷方式在ID和OOD数据集之间共享，但也发现了数据集训练质量和评估质量存在明显脱节的情况。

Conclusion: 该研究呈现了常用OOD基于普适性评估的限制性，并为更稳健地评估QA内外的普适性提供了方法论和建议，对更广泛的AI领域也有重要意义。

Abstract: A majority of recent work in AI assesses models' generalization capabilities
through the lens of performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. Despite
their practicality, such evaluations build upon a strong assumption: that OOD
evaluations can capture and reflect upon possible failures in a real-world
deployment.
  In this work, we challenge this assumption and confront the results obtained
from OOD evaluations with a set of specific failure modes documented in
existing question-answering (QA) models, referred to as a reliance on spurious
features or prediction shortcuts.
  We find that different datasets used for OOD evaluations in QA provide an
estimate of models' robustness to shortcuts that have a vastly different
quality, some largely under-performing even a simple, in-distribution
evaluation. We partially attribute this to the observation that spurious
shortcuts are shared across ID+OOD datasets, but also find cases where a
dataset's quality for training and evaluation is largely disconnected. Our work
underlines limitations of commonly-used OOD-based evaluations of
generalization, and provides methodology and recommendations for evaluating
generalization within and beyond QA more robustly.

TL;DR: 本文分析了不同训练方法对大型语言模型在重排序任务中语义理解能力的影响，并探讨模型是否能生成更有信息量的文本推理来提高透明度和应对有限训练数据的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM语义理解能力的提升，虽然与人类价值观更加一致，但透明度下降。在新系统中，由于用户参与有限和排名数据不足，准确重排序仍然是一个重大挑战。需要深入理解LLM内部工作机制来提供可解释的推理。

Method: 使用环境与地球科学领域相对较小的排名数据集对检索内容进行重排序，分析不同训练方法对LLM语义理解的影响，并检验可解释信息是否能用于推理重排序过程。

Result: 研究发现某些训练方法比其他方法表现出更好的可解释性，表明并非所有训练方法都能学习到准确的语义理解，有些只是获得了抽象知识来优化评估。

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究不同训练方法如何影响LLM在重排序任务中的语义理解能力，以及这些模型是否能生成更有信息量的文本推理来解决透明度和有限训练数据的问题。

Abstract: With the improving semantic understanding capability of Large Language Models
(LLMs), they exhibit a greater awareness and alignment with human values, but
this comes at the cost of transparency. Although promising results are achieved
via experimental analysis, an in-depth understanding of the LLM's internal
workings is unavoidable to comprehend the reasoning behind the re-ranking,
which provides end users with an explanation that enables them to make an
informed decision. Moreover, in newly developed systems with limited user
engagement and insufficient ranking data, accurately re-ranking content remains
a significant challenge. While various training methods affect the training of
LLMs and generate inference, our analysis has found that some training methods
exhibit better explainability than others, implying that an accurate semantic
understanding has not been learned through all training methods; instead,
abstract knowledge has been gained to optimize evaluation, which raises
questions about the true reliability of LLMs. Therefore, in this work, we
analyze how different training methods affect the semantic understanding of the
re-ranking task in LLMs and investigate whether these models can generate more
informed textual reasoning to overcome the challenges of transparency or LLMs
and limited training data. To analyze the LLMs for re-ranking tasks, we utilize
a relatively small ranking dataset from the environment and the Earth science
domain to re-rank retrieved content. Furthermore, we also analyze the
explainable information to see if the re-ranking can be reasoned using
explainability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 波兰语由于历史和政治惯例，主要使用男性形式指代所有人，导致大语言模型继承并强化了这种性别偏见，生成性别不平衡的输出

Method: 使用IPIS数据集（人工制作的性别包容校对和翻译指令）调优LLMs，基于语言学理论设计包含明确性别包容指南的系统提示

Result: 对多语言模型（Llama-8B、Mistral-7B、Mistral-Nemo）和波兰语专用模型（Bielik、PLLuM）进行了IPIS调优

Conclusion: 该方法旨在将性别包容性作为模型的固有特性，为缓解波兰语生成中的性别偏见提供系统性解决方案

Abstract: Imagine a language with masculine, feminine, and neuter grammatical genders,
yet, due to historical and political conventions, masculine forms are
predominantly used to refer to men, women and mixed-gender groups. This is the
reality of contemporary Polish. A social consequence of this unfair linguistic
system is that large language models (LLMs) trained on Polish texts inherit and
reinforce this masculine bias, generating gender-imbalanced outputs. This study
addresses this issue by tuning LLMs using the IPIS dataset, a collection of
human-crafted gender-inclusive proofreading in Polish and Polish-to-English
translation instructions. Grounded in a theoretical linguistic framework, we
design a system prompt with explicit gender-inclusive guidelines for Polish. In
our experiments, we IPIS-tune multilingual LLMs (Llama-8B, Mistral-7B and
Mistral-Nemo) and Polish-specific LLMs (Bielik and PLLuM). Our approach aims to
integrate gender inclusivity as an inherent feature of these models, offering a
systematic solution to mitigate gender bias in Polish language generation.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful foundational
models to solve a variety of tasks, they have also been shown to be prone to
hallucinations, i.e., generating responses that sound confident but are
actually incorrect or even nonsensical. In this work, we formulate the problem
of detecting hallucinations as a hypothesis testing problem and draw parallels
to the problem of out-of-distribution detection in machine learning models. We
propose a multiple-testing-inspired method to solve the hallucination detection
problem, and provide extensive experimental results to validate the robustness
of our approach against state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了两种新的机器翻译自动评价指标COMET-polycand和COMET-polyic，通过综合多个翻译版本或相似文本的评分来提升评估准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的机器翻译自动评价指标通常只考虑单个翻译结果，而人类评测者常在多个翻译版本的上下文中进行评估，这种差异影响了自动评估的性能。

Method: COMET-polycand利用同一源句子的多个翻译版本进行对比分析；COMET-polyic受到检索基于上下文学习的启发，通过综合相似源文本的翻译和人工评分来指导评估。

Result: 结果显示，添加一个额外翻译版本可将Kendall's tau-b相关系数从0.079提升到0.118，而使用检索示例的COMET-polyic也获得类似收益（从0.079提升到0.116）。

Conclusion: 综合多个翻译版本或相似文本的评分信息可以显著提升机器翻译自动评价指标的性能，使其更接近人类评测方式。

Abstract: Automated metrics for machine translation attempt to replicate human
judgment. Unlike humans, who often assess a translation in the context of
multiple alternatives, these metrics typically consider only the source
sentence and a single translation. This discrepancy in the evaluation setup may
negatively impact the performance of automated metrics. We propose two
automated metrics that incorporate additional information beyond the single
translation. COMET-polycand uses alternative translations of the same source
sentence to compare and contrast with the translation at hand, thereby
providing a more informed assessment of its quality. COMET-polyic, inspired by
retrieval-based in-context learning, takes in translations of similar source
texts along with their human-labeled quality scores to guide the evaluation. We
find that including a single additional translation in COMET-polycand improves
the segment-level metric performance (0.079 to 0.118 Kendall's tau-b
correlation), with further gains when more translations are added.
Incorporating retrieved examples in COMET-polyic yields similar improvements
(0.079 to 0.116 Kendall's tau-b correlation). We release our models publicly.

Abstract: Visual metaphor generation is a challenging task that aims to generate an
image given an input text metaphor. Inherently, it needs language understanding
to bind a source concept with a target concept, in a way that preserves meaning
while ensuring visual coherence. We propose a self-evaluating visual metaphor
generation framework that focuses on metaphor alignment. Our self-evaluation
approach combines existing metrics with our newly proposed metaphor
decomposition score and a meaning alignment (MA) metric. Within this setup, we
explore two novel approaches: a training-free pipeline that explicitly
decomposes prompts into source-target-meaning (S-T-M) mapping for image
synthesis, and a complementary training-based pipeline that improves alignment
using our proposed self-evaluation reward schema, without any large-scale
retraining. On the held-out test set, the training-free approach surpasses
strong closed baselines (GPT-4o, Imagen) on decomposition, CLIP, and MA scores,
with the training-based approach close behind. We evaluate our framework output
using a user-facing study, and observed that participants preferred GPT-4o
overall, while our training-free pipeline led open-source methods and edged
Imagen on abstract metaphors. Our analyses show S-T-M prompting helps longer or
more abstract metaphors, with closed models excelling on short, concrete cases;
we also observe sensitivity to sampler settings. Overall, structured prompting
and lightweight RL perform metaphor alignment well under modest compute, and
remaining gaps to human preference appear driven by aesthetics and sampling.

Motivation: 探讨大语言模型的真正本质，区分它们是否反映人类认知能力还是仅仅模拟语料库结构，以涉及对AI模型与人类语言处理机制的深层理解。

Method: 通过对比变换器架构的计算特性（线性处理格式）与人类语言处理的认知特征（超线性计算格式），结合Liu等人关于短接自动机的理论说明变换器的工作机制。

Result: 证明大语言模型主要是对语料库结构的模拟，而非人类认知能力的直接模型，但这并不意味着它们的功能不重要，因为语言本身也是一种可以在合适语境下生成新语言的"话语机器"。

Conclusion: 大语言模型通过不同于人类的方式学会了使用语言这种技术，它们主要是语料库模型而非人类认知模型，但这种差异并不降低其价值，反而强调了语言作为一种生成性工具的本质。

Abstract: What do large language models actually model? Do they tell us something about
human capacities, or are they models of the corpus we've trained them on? I
give a non-deflationary defence of the latter position. Cognitive science tells
us that linguistic capabilities in humans rely supralinear formats for
computation. The transformer architecture, by contrast, supports at best a
linear formats for processing. This argument will rely primarily on certain
invariants of the computational architecture of transformers. I then suggest a
positive story about what transformers are doing, focusing on Liu et al.
(2022)'s intriguing speculations about shortcut automata. I conclude with why I
don't think this is a terribly deflationary story. Language is not (just) a
means for expressing inner state but also a kind of 'discourse machine' that
lets us make new language given appropriate context. We have learned to use
this technology in one way; LLMs have also learned to use it too, but via very
different means.

Abstract: Translating electronic health record (EHR) narratives from English to Spanish

such challenges, we propose \textbf{NOOV} (for No OOV), a new neural machine
translation (NMT) system that requires little in-domain parallel-aligned corpus
for training. NOOV integrates a bilingual lexicon automatically learned from
parallel-aligned corpora and a phrase look-up table extracted from a large

the word-repeat challenge in NMT, enhancing better phrase generation of NMT
systems. Evaluation shows that NOOV is able to generate better translation of
EHR with improvement in both accuracy and fluency.

Result: 核心发现表明知识记忆对有效位宽、校准集大小和模型大小的变化比知识利用更加敏感

Conclusion: 研究结果提供了对PTQ影响的细粒度理解，为开发能更好保护目标认知功能的知识感知量化策略提供指导

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to
their scale, with post-training quantization (PTQ) emerging as a practical
compression solution. However, a comprehensive understanding of how PTQ
precisely impacts diverse LLM knowledge capabilities remains elusive, and
existing scaling laws for quantized models often overlook crucial PTQ-specific
parameters and task-specific sensitivities. This paper addresses these gaps by
conducting an extensive empirical investigation to establish task-stratified
scaling laws. We disentangle LLM knowledge into memorization and utilization
capabilities and develop a unified quantitative framework that incorporates
model size, effective bit-width, calibration set size, and group size. Our
central finding reveals that knowledge memorization exhibits markedly greater
sensitivity to variations in effective bit-width, calibration set size, and
model size compared to the more robust knowledge utilization. These findings
offer a fine-grained understanding of PTQ's impact and provide guidance for
developing knowledge-aware quantization strategies that can better preserve
targeted cognitive functions.

Motivation: LLM在复杂推理任务（如数学）中表现不佳，因为训练数据缺乏人类思考过程中的关键insights和思维步骤

Method: 提出Thinking Before You Speak (TBYS)框架，在推理步骤间主动生成insights来指导后续推理，并设计自动收集和过滤上下文示例的pipeline

Result: 在具有挑战性的数学数据集上的实验验证了TBYS的有效性

Conclusion: 通过主动生成insights来模拟人类思考过程，可以有效提升LLM在复杂推理任务中的表现

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit deficiencies with complex
reasoning tasks, such as maths, which we attribute to the discrepancy between
human reasoning patterns and those presented in the LLMs' training data. When
dealing with complex problems, humans tend to think carefully before expressing
solutions. However, they often do not articulate their inner thoughts,
including their intentions and chosen methodologies. Consequently, critical
insights essential for bridging reasoning steps may be absent in training data
collected from human sources. To bridge this gap, we proposes inserting
\emph{insight}s between consecutive reasoning steps, which review the status
and initiate the next reasoning steps. Unlike prior prompting strategies that
rely on a single or a workflow of static prompts to facilitate reasoning,
\emph{insight}s are \emph{proactively} generated to guide reasoning processes.
We implement our idea as a reasoning framework, named \emph{Thinking Before You
Speak} (TBYS), and design a pipeline for automatically collecting and filtering
in-context examples for the generation of \emph{insight}s, which alleviates
human labeling efforts and fine-tuning overheads. Experiments on challenging
mathematical datasets verify the effectiveness of TBYS. Project website:

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在整合外部知识时无法同时保持忠实性和表达性的问题，避免输出或缺乏知识支持或过于繁琐不自然

Conclusion: CoDe作为一种即插即用的框架，通过动态整合外部知识和模型内部参数，成功解决了忠实性与表达性之间的交易折衰，验证了其有效性和通用性

Abstract: Grounding responses in external knowledge represents an effective strategy
for mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current
LLMs struggle to seamlessly integrate knowledge while simultaneously
maintaining faithfulness (or fidelity) and expressiveness, capabilities that
humans naturally possess. This limitation results in outputs that either lack
support from external knowledge, thereby compromising faithfulness, or appear
overly verbose and unnatural, thus sacrificing expressiveness. In this work, to
break the trade-off between faithfulness and expressiveness, we propose
Collaborative Decoding (CoDe), a novel approach that dynamically integrates
output probabilities generated with and without external knowledge. This
integration is guided by distribution divergence and model confidence, enabling
the selective activation of relevant and reliable expressions from the model's
internal parameters. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge-aware reranking
mechanism that prevents over-reliance on prior parametric knowledge while

TL;DR: 提出Emotion Omni模型架构，通过有限数据和无需大规模训练的方式，让语音大语言模型能够理解用户语音中的情感内容并生成共情语音响应


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音大模型仅简单转换回复内容为语音，未能充分理解用户查询中丰富的情感和副语言线索。情感理解对于提升人机交互体验至关重要，但现有共情语音模型需要大量数据和计算资源

Method: 提出新颖的Emotion Omni模型架构，开发基于开源TTS框架的数据生成管道，构建了20万条情感对话数据集

Result: 成功构建了支持共情语音助手的数据集和模型架构，演示样例已公开

Conclusion: Emotion Omni为解决有限数据下开发具有情感理解能力的语音大语言模型提供了有效方案，能够生成共情的语音响应

Abstract: With the development of speech large language models (speech LLMs), users can
now interact directly with assistants via speech. However, most existing models
simply convert the response content into speech without fully understanding the
rich emotional and paralinguistic cues embedded in the user's query. In many
cases, the same sentence can have different meanings depending on the emotional
expression. Furthermore, emotional understanding is essential for improving
user experience in human-machine interaction. Currently, most speech LLMs with
empathetic capabilities are trained on massive datasets. This approach requires
vast amounts of data and significant computational resources. Therefore, a key
challenge lies in how to develop a speech LLM capable of generating empathetic
responses with limited data and without the need for large-scale training. To
address this challenge, we propose Emotion Omni, a novel model architecture
designed to understand the emotional content of user speech input and generate
empathetic speech responses. Additionally, we developed a data generation
pipeline based on an open-source TTS framework to construct a 200k emotional
dialogue dataset, which supports the construction of an empathetic speech
assistant. The demos are available at https://w311411.github.io/omni_demo/

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现当前医学视觉语言模型在医学视觉问答中存在严重的答案不一致问题，面对语义相同的医学问题重述时答案波动显著。作者构建了RoMed数据集并提出了CCL方法，显著提升了模型的一致性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险医疗应用中，确保模型对不同表述的医学问题给出一致答案至关重要。当前Med-VLMs在面对语义等效的问题重述时表现出令人担忧的脆弱性，这影响了诊断的可靠性。

Method: 构建了RoMed数据集（包含14.4万个问题，涵盖词汇级、句子级和语义级扰动），并提出了CCL方法：1）知识锚定一致性学习，将模型与医学知识对齐；2）偏感知对比学习，通过判别性表示精炼缓解数据特定先验。

Result: 在RoMed数据集上评估SOTA模型（如LLaVA-Med）时观察到性能显著下降（如召回率下降40%）。CCL方法在三个流行VQA基准测试中达到SOTA性能，并在RoMed测试集上将答案一致性提高了50%。

Conclusion: 当前Med-VLMs存在严重的鲁棒性问题，CCL方法通过知识对齐和偏感知学习有效提升了模型的一致性和鲁棒性，为医疗AI的可靠性提供了重要改进。

Abstract: In high-stakes medical applications, consistent answering across diverse
question phrasings is essential for reliable diagnosis. However, we reveal that
current Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) exhibit concerning fragility
in Medical Visual Question Answering, as their answers fluctuate significantly
when faced with semantically equivalent rephrasings of medical questions. We
attribute this to two limitations: (1) insufficient alignment of medical
concepts, leading to divergent reasoning patterns, and (2) hidden biases in
training data that prioritize syntactic shortcuts over semantic understanding.
To address these challenges, we construct RoMed, a dataset built upon original
VQA datasets containing 144k questions with variations spanning word-level,
sentence-level, and semantic-level perturbations. When evaluating
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models like LLaVA-Med on RoMed, we observe alarming
performance drops (e.g., a 40\% decline in Recall) compared to original VQA
benchmarks, exposing critical robustness gaps. To bridge this gap, we propose
Consistency and Contrastive Learning (CCL), which integrates two key
components: (1) knowledge-anchored consistency learning, aligning Med-VLMs with
medical knowledge rather than shallow feature patterns, and (2) bias-aware
contrastive learning, mitigating data-specific priors through discriminative
representation refinement. CCL achieves SOTA performance on three popular VQA
benchmarks and notably improves answer consistency by 50\% on the challenging
RoMed test set, demonstrating significantly enhanced robustness. Code will be
released.

TL;DR: 提出了Attention2Probability方法，通过注意力权重转换和课程学习来提升语音大模型中专业术语的识别准确率，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音大模型在通用领域表现良好，但在处理领域特定术语和新词时准确率不足，需要专门的方法来提升术语识别能力。

Method: Attention2Probability将语音与术语间的交叉注意力权重转换为存在概率，并采用课程学习增强检索准确性，同时构建了新的术语语音数据集。

Result: 在测试集上显著超越VectorDB方法，中英文最大召回率分别达到92.57%和86.83%，单查询延迟仅8.71ms，术语准确率提升6-17%。

Conclusion: 该方法轻量、灵活且准确，有效提升了语音大模型的术语处理能力，同时揭示了当前模型在术语利用方面仍存在局限性。

Abstract: Recent advances in speech large language models (SLMs) have improved speech
recognition and translation in general domains, but accurately generating
domain-specific terms or neologisms remains challenging. To address this, we
propose Attention2Probability: attention-driven terminology probability
estimation for robust speech-to-text system, which is lightweight, flexible,
and accurate. Attention2Probability converts cross-attention weights between
speech and terminology into presence probabilities, and it further employs
curriculum learning to enhance retrieval accuracy. Furthermore, to tackle the
lack of data for speech-to-text tasks with terminology intervention, we create
and release a new speech dataset with terminology to support future research in
this area. Experimental results show that Attention2Probability significantly
outperforms the VectorDB method on our test set. Specifically, its maximum
recall rates reach 92.57% for Chinese and 86.83% for English. This high recall
is achieved with a latency of only 8.71ms per query. Intervening in SLMs'
recognition and translation tasks using Attention2Probability-retrieved terms
improves terminology accuracy by 6-17%, while revealing that the current
utilization of terminology by SLMs has limitations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了自适应原创性过滤(AOF)提示框架，通过余弦相似度拒绝冗余生成，在多语言谜语生成任务中显著提升了GPT-4o的词汇多样性和跨语言保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言谜语生成需要平衡文化流畅性和创造性抽象，但标准提示策略往往重复记忆的谜语或进行浅层改写，缺乏真正的创造性。

Method: 引入自适应原创性过滤(AOF)框架，使用基于余弦相似度的拒绝机制来过滤冗余生成，同时强制词汇新颖性和跨语言保真度。

Result: 在三个LLM和四个语言对的评估中，AOF增强的GPT-4o在日语上达到0.177 Self-BLEU和0.915 Distinct-2，表明词汇多样性提升且冗余减少。

Conclusion: 语义拒绝机制可以在无需任务特定微调的情况下，指导文化基础扎实的创造性生成。

Abstract: Multilingual riddle generation challenges large language models (LLMs) to
balance cultural fluency with creative abstraction. Standard prompting
strategies -- zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought -- tend to reuse memorized
riddles or perform shallow paraphrasing. We introduce Adaptive Originality
Filtering (AOF), a prompting framework that filters redundant generations using
cosine-based similarity rejection, while enforcing lexical novelty and
cross-lingual fidelity. Evaluated across three LLMs and four language pairs,
AOF-enhanced GPT-4o achieves \texttt{0.177} Self-BLEU and \texttt{0.915}
Distinct-2 in Japanese, signaling improved lexical diversity and reduced
redundancy compared to other prompting methods and language pairs. Our findings
show that semantic rejection can guide culturally grounded, creative generation
without task-specific fine-tuning.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在客户服务中的快速应用带来了新的风险，恶意行为者可能利用其进行大规模用户冒充。现有检测方法在在线对话环境中表现不佳，缺乏可靠性和可解释性，特别是在非专家用户操作的服务场景中。

Method: 提出EMMM框架，采用先解释后检测的方法，为非专家用户提供可理解的解释，同时保持低延迟和高准确性。

Result: 实验结果显示，EMMM能为非专家用户提供可访问的解释，70%的人类评估者偏好其输出，在保持竞争性准确度的同时，输出延迟低于1秒。

Conclusion: EMMM框架成功解决了客户服务场景中机器生成文本检测的可解释性问题，为非专家用户提供了可信赖的AI部署解决方案，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in customer service
introduces new risks, as malicious actors can exploit them to conduct
large-scale user impersonation through machine-generated text (MGT). Current
MGT detection methods often struggle in online conversational settings,
reducing the reliability and interpretability essential for trustworthy AI
deployment. In customer service scenarios where operators are typically
non-expert users, explanation become crucial for trustworthy MGT detection. In
this paper, we propose EMMM, an explanation-then-detection framework that
balances latency, accuracy, and non-expert-oriented interpretability.
Experimental results demonstrate that EMMM provides explanations accessible to
non-expert users, with 70\% of human evaluators preferring its outputs, while
achieving competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models and
maintaining low latency, generating outputs within 1 second. Our code and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前广告标题生成方法主要优化质量或点击率，忽视了多样性需求，导致输出同质化严重，无法满足不同受众群体的需求。

Method: 提出语义和风格感知的数据生成管道自动创建高质量训练对；采用多阶段多目标优化框架，结合监督微调和强化学习，在单次前向传播中生成高质量多样化标题。

Result: 在真实工业数据集上验证了DIVER能有效平衡质量和多样性；在大规模内容分享平台部署后，广告价值提升4.0%，点击率提升1.4%。

Conclusion: DIVER框架成功解决了广告标题生成中质量与多样性的平衡问题，为现代广告提供了既高质量又多样化的标题生成解决方案。

Abstract: The generation of ad headlines plays a vital role in modern advertising,
where both quality and diversity are essential to engage a broad range of
audience segments. Current approaches primarily optimize language models for
headline quality or click-through rates (CTR), often overlooking the need for
diversity and resulting in homogeneous outputs. To address this limitation, we
propose DIVER, a novel framework based on large language models (LLMs) that are
jointly optimized for both diversity and quality. We first design a semantic-
and stylistic-aware data generation pipeline that automatically produces
high-quality training pairs with ad content and multiple diverse headlines. To
achieve the goal of generating high-quality and diversified ad headlines within
a single forward pass, we propose a multi-stage multi-objective optimization
framework with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL).
Experiments on real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that DIVER
effectively balances quality and diversity. Deployed on a large-scale
content-sharing platform serving hundreds of millions of users, our framework
improves advertiser value (ADVV) and CTR by 4.0% and 1.4%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MECTEC任务缺乏多样化数据集，且现有方法未能显式建模情感和因果上下文，忽略了不同层次语义信息的融合，导致性能下降

Method: 提出M3HG模型，使用多模态异构图显式捕获情感和因果上下文，在话语间和话语内两个层次有效融合上下文信息

Result: 大量实验证明M3HG相比现有最先进方法具有更好的效果

Conclusion: M3HG模型能够有效解决多模态对话中情感原因三元组提取问题，提出的MECAD数据集为后续研究提供了重要资源

Abstract: Emotion Cause Triplet Extraction in Multimodal Conversations (MECTEC) has
recently gained significant attention in social media analysis, aiming to
extract emotion utterances, cause utterances, and emotion categories
simultaneously. However, the scarcity of related datasets, with only one
published dataset featuring highly uniform dialogue scenarios, hinders model
development in this field. To address this, we introduce MECAD, the first
multimodal, multi-scenario MECTEC dataset, comprising 989 conversations from 56
TV series spanning a wide range of dialogue contexts. In addition, existing
MECTEC methods fail to explicitly model emotional and causal contexts and
neglect the fusion of semantic information at different levels, leading to
performance degradation. In this paper, we propose M3HG, a novel model that
explicitly captures emotional and causal contexts and effectively fuses
contextual information at both inter- and intra-utterance levels via a
multimodal heterogeneous graph. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of M3HG compared with existing state-of-the-art methods. The
codes and dataset are available at https://github.com/redifinition/M3HG.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChronoRAG是一个专门针对叙事文本的新型RAG框架，通过重构分散信息为连贯段落并显式保持时间顺序，显著提升了长上下文叙事问答任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法在处理叙事文本时效果有限，因为叙事理解需要超越孤立片段，依赖更广泛的上下文和段落间的顺序关系。叙事问答中正确答案往往取决于重建连贯的事件时间线。

Method: 提出ChronoRAG框架，专注于两个关键方面：1）将分散的文档信息精炼为连贯的结构化段落；2）通过显式捕获和维护检索段落间的时间顺序来保持叙事流。

Result: 在NarrativeQA数据集上的实验证明，ChronoRAG在需要事实识别和复杂顺序关系理解的任务中取得了显著改进，表明时间顺序推理对解决叙事问答至关重要。

Conclusion: 时间顺序推理是解决叙事问答的关键因素，ChronoRAG通过专门针对叙事文本特性的设计，有效提升了长上下文问答任务的性能。

Abstract: Long-context question answering over narrative tasks is challenging because
correct answers often hinge on reconstructing a coherent timeline of events
while preserving contextual flow in a limited context window.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) indexing methods aim to address this
challenge by selectively retrieving only necessary document segments. However,
narrative texts possess unique characteristics that limit the effectiveness of
these existing approaches. Specifically, understanding narrative texts requires
more than isolated segments, as the broader context and sequential
relationships between segments are crucial for comprehension. To address these
limitations, we propose ChronoRAG, a novel RAG framework specialized for
narrative texts. This approach focuses on two essential aspects: refining
dispersed document information into coherent and structured passages, and
preserving narrative flow by explicitly capturing and maintaining the temporal
order among retrieved passages. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of
ChronoRAG through experiments on the NarrativeQA dataset, showing substantial
improvements in tasks requiring both factual identification and comprehension
of complex sequential relationships, underscoring that reasoning over temporal
order is crucial in resolving narrative QA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源模型缺乏像GPT系列那样的可控推理能力，无法在计算效率和性能之间进行灵活权衡，限制了实际部署

Method: 端到端训练范式：预算模式监督微调 + 两阶段预算感知强化学习 + 自适应奖励塑造

Result: 成功实现三种推理模式：High（全能力）、Medium（减少50% token，性能下降<10%）、Low（减少75% token，性能下降<15%）

Conclusion: ThinkDial框架实现了目标压缩-性能权衡，具有清晰的响应长度减少和强泛化能力，为开源社区提供了可控推理解决方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought reasoning have
demonstrated remarkable problem-solving capabilities, but controlling their
computational effort remains a significant challenge for practical deployment.
Recent proprietary systems like OpenAI's gpt-oss series have introduced
discrete operational modes for intuitive reasoning control, but the open-source
community has largely failed to achieve such capabilities. In this paper, we
introduce ThinkDial, the first open-recipe end-to-end framework that
successfully implements gpt-oss-style controllable reasoning through discrete
operational modes. Our system enables seamless switching between three distinct
reasoning regimes: High mode (full reasoning capability), Medium mode (50
percent token reduction with <10 percent performance degradation), and Low mode
(75 percent token reduction with <15 percent performance degradation). We
achieve this through an end-to-end training paradigm that integrates
budget-mode control throughout the entire pipeline: budget-mode supervised
fine-tuning that embeds controllable reasoning capabilities directly into the
learning process, and two-phase budget-aware reinforcement learning with
adaptive reward shaping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ThinkDial
achieves target compression-performance trade-offs with clear response length
reductions while maintaining performance thresholds. The framework also
exhibits strong generalization capabilities on out-of-distribution tasks.

Method: 提出了一种基于规则强化学习（Rule-Based RL）的新框架，通过强化学习方式来导向大语言模型

Result: 在中文数据集上达到了最先进的性能水平，可叐率（recall）指标有显著提升

Conclusion: 强化学习方法能够更好地导向大语言模型，提供了更可控制和可靠的语法错误编正方案，为该领域的未来发展提供了新的研究方向

Abstract: Grammatical error correction is a significant task in NLP. Traditional
methods based on encoder-decoder models have achieved certain success, but the
application of LLMs in this field is still underexplored. Current research
predominantly relies on supervised fine-tuning to train LLMs to directly
generate the corrected sentence, which limits the model's powerful reasoning
ability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework based on
Rule-Based RL. Through experiments on the Chinese datasets, our Rule-Based RL
framework achieves \textbf{state-of-the-art }performance, with a notable
increase in \textbf{recall}. This result clearly highlights the advantages of
using RL to steer LLMs, offering a more controllable and reliable paradigm for
future development in GEC.

Abstract: Conversational analytics has been on the forefront of transformation driven
by the advances in Speech and Natural Language Processing techniques. Rapid
adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the analytics field has taken the
problems that can be automated to a new level of complexity and scale. In this
paper, we introduce Theme Detection as a critical task in conversational
analytics, aimed at automatically identifying and categorizing topics within
conversations. This process can significantly reduce the manual effort involved
in analyzing expansive dialogs, particularly in domains like customer support
or sales. Unlike traditional dialog intent detection, which often relies on a
fixed set of intents for downstream system logic, themes are intended as a
direct, user-facing summary of the conversation's core inquiry. This
distinction allows for greater flexibility in theme surface forms and
user-specific customizations. We pose Controllable Conversational Theme
Detection problem as a public competition track at Dialog System Technology
Challenge (DSTC) 12 -- it is framed as joint clustering and theme labeling of
dialog utterances, with the distinctive aspect being controllability of the
resulting theme clusters' granularity achieved via the provided user preference
data. We give an overview of the problem, the associated dataset and the
evaluation metrics, both automatic and human. Finally, we discuss the
participant teams' submissions and provide insights from those. The track
materials (data and code) are openly available in the GitHub repository.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of modern machine translation (MT) systems on
general-domain texts, translating structured LaTeX-formatted documents remains
a significant challenge. These documents typically interleave natural language
with domain-specific syntax, such as mathematical equations, tables, figures,
and cross-references, all of which must be accurately preserved to maintain
semantic integrity and compilability. In this paper, we introduce LaTeXTrans, a
collaborative multi-agent system designed to address this challenge. LaTeXTrans
ensures format preservation, structural fidelity, and terminology consistency
through six specialized agents: 1) a Parser that decomposes LaTeX into
translation-friendly units via placeholder substitution and syntax filtering;
2) a Translator, Validator, Summarizer, and Terminology Extractor that work
collaboratively to ensure context-aware, self-correcting, and
terminology-consistent translations; 3) a Generator that reconstructs the
translated content into well-structured LaTeX documents. Experimental results
demonstrate that LaTeXTrans can outperform mainstream MT systems in both
translation accuracy and structural fidelity, offering an effective and
practical solution for translating LaTeX-formatted documents.

Conclusion: 提出的自监督框架通过结合语义和传播特征，有效区分真假新闻，解决了现有方法在依赖关系和标注数据需求方面的局限性

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation in the digital age has led to significant
societal challenges. Existing approaches often struggle with capturing
long-range dependencies, complex semantic relations, and the social dynamics
influencing news dissemination. Furthermore, these methods require extensive
labelled datasets, making their deployment resource-intensive. In this study,
we propose a novel self-supervised misinformation detection framework that
integrates both complex semantic relations using Abstract Meaning
Representation (AMR) and news propagation dynamics. We introduce an LLM-based
graph contrastive loss (LGCL) that utilizes negative anchor points generated by
a Large Language Model (LLM) to enhance feature separability in a zero-shot
manner. To incorporate social context, we employ a multi view graph masked
autoencoder, which learns news propagation features from social context graph.
By combining these semantic and propagation-based features, our approach
effectively differentiates between fake and real news in a self-supervised
manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our self-supervised framework
achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art methodologies,
even with limited labelled datasets while improving generalizability.

Abstract: Enhancing the mathematical reasoning of large language models (LLMs) demands
high-quality training data, yet conventional methods face critical challenges
in scalability, cost, and data reliability. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel program-assisted synthesis framework that systematically
generates a high-quality mathematical corpus with guaranteed diversity,
complexity, and correctness. This framework integrates mathematical knowledge
systems and domain-specific tools to create executable programs. These programs
are then translated into natural language problem-solution pairs and vetted by
a bilateral validation mechanism that verifies solution correctness against
program outputs and ensures program-problem consistency. We have generated 12.3
million such problem-solving triples. Experiments demonstrate that models
fine-tuned on our data significantly improve their inference capabilities,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets and
showcasing the effectiveness of our synthesis approach.

Conclusion: 该方法推进了可信赖LLM系统的发展，通过简单高效的微调方法有效解决了LLM过度自信问题，代码已开源

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains
such as science, law, and healthcare, where accurate expressions of uncertainty
are essential for reliability and trust. However, current LLMs are often
observed to generate incorrect answers with high confidence, a phenomenon known
as "overconfidence". Recent efforts have focused on calibrating LLMs'
verbalized confidence: i.e., their expressions of confidence in text form, such
as "I am 80% confident that...". Existing approaches either rely on prompt
engineering or fine-tuning with heuristically generated uncertainty estimates,
both of which have limited effectiveness and generalizability. Motivated by the
notion of proper scoring rules for calibration in classical machine learning
models, we introduce ConfTuner, a simple and efficient fine-tuning method that
introduces minimal overhead and does not require ground-truth confidence scores
or proxy confidence estimates. ConfTuner relies on a new loss function,
tokenized Brier score, which we theoretically prove to be a proper scoring
rule, intuitively meaning that it "correctly incentivizes the model to report
its true probability of being correct". ConfTuner improves calibration across
diverse reasoning tasks and generalizes to black-box models such as GPT-4o. Our
results further show that better-calibrated confidence enables downstream gains
in self-correction and model cascade, advancing the development of trustworthy
LLM systems. The code is available at

TL;DR: ReflectivePrompt是一种基于进化算法的自动提示方法，通过短期和长期反射操作来优化提示选择，在33个数据集上相比现有方法平均提升28%性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的快速发展，自动选择优化提示的需求日益增长，传统方法在精确性和全面性方面存在不足

Method: 基于进化算法，采用反射进化方法，在交叉和精英变异前进行短期和长期反射操作，积累进化过程中的知识并在每个epoch更新

Result: 在33个分类和文本生成数据集上测试，使用t-lite-instruct-0.1和gemma3-27b-it模型，相比现有最优方法平均提升28%（在BBH数据集上）

Conclusion: ReflectivePrompt成为进化算法自动提示领域最有效的解决方案之一，通过反射机制显著提升了提示优化的效果

Abstract: Autoprompting is the process of automatically selecting optimized prompts for
language models, which has been gaining popularity with the rapid advancement
of prompt engineering, driven by extensive research in the field of large
language models (LLMs). This paper presents ReflectivePrompt - a novel
autoprompting method based on evolutionary algorithms that employs a reflective
evolution approach for more precise and comprehensive search of optimal
prompts. ReflectivePrompt utilizes short-term and long-term reflection
operations before crossover and elitist mutation to enhance the quality of the
modifications they introduce. This method allows for the accumulation of
knowledge obtained throughout the evolution process and updates it at each
epoch based on the current population. ReflectivePrompt was tested on 33
datasets for classification and text generation tasks using open-access large
language models: t-lite-instruct-0.1 and gemma3-27b-it. The method
demonstrates, on average, a significant improvement (e.g., 28% on BBH compared
to EvoPrompt) in metrics relative to current state-of-the-art approaches,
thereby establishing itself as one of the most effective solutions in
evolutionary algorithm-based autoprompting.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合大型语言模型的内容分析方法(LACA)，用于处理计算教育研究中的大量文本数据，帮助研究者进行更大规模、更严谨的研究


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算教育研究(CER)领域的研究者通常缺乏资源进行大规模严谨研究，需要一种能够处理大量定性数据而不增加研究负担的方法

Method: LLM辅助内容分析(LACA)方法，将传统内容分析与大型语言模型相结合，使用计算教育数据集进行可复现的严谨分析

Result: 该方法能够使研究者进行更大规模的研究，获得更具普适性的发现，提升CER领域的研究质量和实践水平

Conclusion: LACA方法在计算教育研究领域具有重要潜力，结合类似方法的发展可以推动CER学科实践和研究质量的进步

Abstract: Computing education research (CER) is often instigated by practitioners
wanting to improve both their own and the wider discipline's teaching practice.
However, the latter is often difficult as many researchers lack the colleagues,
resources, or capacity to conduct research that is generalisable or rigorous
enough to advance the discipline. As a result, research methods that enable
sense-making with larger volumes of qualitative data, while not increasing the
burden on the researcher, have significant potential within CER.
  In this discussion paper, we propose such a method for conducting rigorous
analysis on large volumes of textual data, namely a variation of LLM-assisted
content analysis (LACA). This method combines content analysis with the use of
large language models, empowering researchers to conduct larger-scale research
which they would otherwise not be able to perform. Using a computing education
dataset, we illustrate how LACA could be applied in a reproducible and rigorous
manner. We believe this method has potential in CER, enabling more
generalisable findings from a wider range of research. This, together with the
development of similar methods, can help to advance both the practice and
research quality of the CER discipline.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究欧洲议会中是否存在情感极化现象，即对政治对立群体的负面情绪和敌意增加的趋势

Method: 收集六个欧洲国家议会演讲语料库，运用自然语言处理技术估计议员情感倾向，比较对己方和对方群体成员的负面情绪表达水平

Result: 在所有六个欧洲议会中都发现了持续的情感极化现象；活动量与负面情绪相关，但活跃度不同的议员在情感极化方面没有差异；互惠性是跨议会情感极化的贡献机制

Conclusion: 欧洲议会普遍存在情感极化，互惠机制在其中起重要作用，这对理解政治对立和改善议会对话有重要意义

Abstract: Affective polarization, characterized by increased negativity and hostility
towards opposing groups, has become a prominent feature of political discourse
worldwide. Our study examines the presence of this type of polarization in a
selection of European parliaments in a fully automated manner. Utilizing a
comprehensive corpus of parliamentary speeches from the parliaments of six
European countries, we employ natural language processing techniques to
estimate parliamentarian sentiment. By comparing the levels of negativity
conveyed in references to individuals from opposing groups versus one's own, we
discover patterns of affectively polarized interactions. The findings
demonstrate the existence of consistent affective polarization across all six
European parliaments. Although activity correlates with negativity, there is no
observed difference in affective polarization between less active and more
active members of parliament. Finally, we show that reciprocity is a
contributing mechanism in affective polarization between parliamentarians
across all six parliaments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG系统的评估主要关注性能指标，而忽视了评估数据集的设计和质量，特别是在保护敏感信息等现实约束方面存在不足

Method: 使用多智能体框架：1）多样性代理利用聚类技术最大化主题覆盖和语义变异性；2）隐私代理检测和屏蔽多领域的敏感信息；3）QA整理代理合成适合作为RAG评估基准的私密且多样的QA对

Result: 实验表明，该方法生成的评估集在多样性方面优于基线方法，并在领域特定数据集上实现了稳健的隐私屏蔽

Conclusion: 这项工作为更安全、更全面的RAG系统评估提供了实用且符合伦理的途径，为未来符合AI法规和合规标准的增强奠定了基础

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems improve large language model
outputs by incorporating external knowledge, enabling more informed and
context-aware responses. However, the effectiveness and trustworthiness of
these systems critically depends on how they are evaluated, particularly on
whether the evaluation process captures real-world constraints like protecting
sensitive information. While current evaluation efforts for RAG systems have
primarily focused on the development of performance metrics, far less attention
has been given to the design and quality of the underlying evaluation datasets,
despite their pivotal role in enabling meaningful, reliable assessments. In
this work, we introduce a novel multi-agent framework for generating synthetic
QA datasets for RAG evaluation that prioritize semantic diversity and privacy
preservation. Our approach involves: (1) a Diversity agent leveraging
clustering techniques to maximize topical coverage and semantic variability,
(2) a Privacy Agent that detects and mask sensitive information across multiple
domains and (3) a QA curation agent that synthesizes private and diverse QA
pairs suitable as ground truth for RAG evaluation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our evaluation sets outperform baseline methods in diversity
and achieve robust privacy masking on domain-specific datasets. This work
offers a practical and ethically aligned pathway toward safer, more
comprehensive RAG system evaluation, laying the foundation for future
enhancements aligned with evolving AI regulations and compliance standards.

Motivation: 现有的事后解释方法存在局限性，需要将推理直接嵌入到模型表示中，实现真正的内在可解释性，同时保持神经模型的灵活性和准确性。

Method: 引入互补训练目标增强符号纯度和决策稀疏性，采用顺序专业化策略先建立广泛的符号能力再细化直觉判断，使用符号捕获语义模式、链式追踪决策路径和门控归纳机制。

Result: 在AI任务上展示了具有竞争力的准确性，同时提供可验证的推理轨迹，证明AI母语可以作为神经网络模型中可解释性、直觉和符号推理的统一机制。

Conclusion: AI母语框架成功实现了将符号推理与神经表示相结合，为构建既准确又可解释的AI系统提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: We present a framework where neural models develop an AI Mother Tongue, a
native symbolic language that simultaneously supports intuitive reasoning,
compositional symbol chains, and inherent interpretability. Unlike post-hoc
explanation methods, our approach embeds reasoning directly into the model's
representations: symbols capture meaningful semantic patterns, chains trace
decision paths, and gated induction mechanisms guide selective focus, yielding
transparent yet flexible reasoning. We introduce complementary training
objectives to enhance symbol purity and decision sparsity, and employ a
sequential specialization strategy to first build broad symbolic competence and
then refine intuitive judgments. Experiments on AI tasks demonstrate
competitive accuracy alongside verifiable reasoning traces, showing that AI
Mother Tongue can serve as a unified mechanism for interpretability, intuition,
and symbolic reasoning in neural models.

Abstract: This paper introduces MovieCORE, a novel video question answering (VQA)
dataset designed to probe deeper cognitive understanding of movie content.
Unlike existing datasets that focus on surface-level comprehension, MovieCORE
emphasizes questions that engage System-2 thinking while remaining specific to
the video material. We present an innovative agentic brainstorming approach,
utilizing multiple large language models (LLMs) as thought agents to generate
and refine high-quality question-answer pairs. To evaluate dataset quality, we
develop a set of cognitive tests assessing depth, thought-provocation
potential, and syntactic complexity. We also propose a comprehensive evaluation
scheme for assessing VQA model performance on deeper cognitive tasks. To
address the limitations of existing video-language models (VLMs), we introduce
an agentic enhancement module, Agentic Choice Enhancement (ACE), which improves
model reasoning capabilities post-training by up to 25%. Our work contributes
to advancing movie understanding in AI systems and provides valuable insights
into the capabilities and limitations of current VQA models when faced with
more challenging, nuanced questions about cinematic content. Our project page,

TL;DR: HiPlan是一个分层规划框架，通过全局里程碑和局部逐步提示来增强LLM代理在复杂长程规划任务中的决策能力，显著优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理在复杂长程规划任务中缺乏宏观指导和持续监督，容易迷失方向和对环境变化不敏感，导致任务失败。

Method: 采用分层规划框架：离线阶段构建里程碑库进行结构化经验复用；执行阶段动态适配轨迹片段生成逐步提示，将当前观察与里程碑目标对齐。

Result: 在两个具有挑战性的基准测试中，HiPlan显著优于强基线方法，消融研究验证了其分层组件的互补效益。

Conclusion: HiPlan通过提供自适应全局-局部指导，有效解决了LLM代理在复杂规划任务中的方向迷失和偏差问题，提升了决策性能。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in decision-making tasks, but struggle significantly with complex,
long-horizon planning scenarios. This arises from their lack of macroscopic
guidance, causing disorientation and failures in complex tasks, as well as
insufficient continuous oversight during execution, rendering them unresponsive
to environmental changes and prone to deviations. To tackle these challenges,
we introduce HiPlan, a hierarchical planning framework that provides adaptive
global-local guidance to boost LLM-based agents'decision-making. HiPlan
decomposes complex tasks into milestone action guides for general direction and
step-wise hints for detailed actions. During the offline phase, we construct a
milestone library from expert demonstrations, enabling structured experience
reuse by retrieving semantically similar tasks and milestones. In the execution
phase, trajectory segments from past milestones are dynamically adapted to
generate step-wise hints that align current observations with the milestone
objectives, bridging gaps and correcting deviations. Extensive experiments
across two challenging benchmarks demonstrate that HiPlan substantially
outperforms strong baselines, and ablation studies validate the complementary
benefits of its hierarchical components.

Method: 使用ACI-bench数据集，与医疗专业人员合作开发基于SOAP框架的细粒度意图分类系统，通过群众筹码平台承包医疗专家标注超5000个医生-患者轮次对话。

Result: 模型能高精度理解医疗对话结构，但在SOAP类别过渡识别方面存在困难。首次报告了医疗对话中的常见轨迹模式，对辨证诊断系统设计有价值。意图过滤能显著提升医疗对话摘要性能。

Conclusion: 这项研究为医疗意图分析领域做出了重要贡献，提供了大规模标注数据集和分析框架，对医疗AI系统的设计和发展具有重要意义。

Abstract: In a doctor-patient dialogue, the primary objective of physicians is to
diagnose patients and propose a treatment plan. Medical doctors guide these
conversations through targeted questioning to efficiently gather the
information required to provide the best possible outcomes for patients. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies physician intent
trajectories in doctor-patient dialogues. We use the `Ambient Clinical
Intelligence Benchmark' (Aci-bench) dataset for our study. We collaborate with
medical professionals to develop a fine-grained taxonomy of physician intents
based on the SOAP framework (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan). We
then conduct a large-scale annotation effort to label over 5000 doctor-patient
turns with the help of a large number of medical experts recruited using
Prolific, a popular crowd-sourcing platform. This large labeled dataset is an
important resource contribution that we use for benchmarking the
state-of-the-art generative and encoder models for medical intent
classification tasks. Our findings show that our models understand the general
structure of medical dialogues with high accuracy, but often fail to identify
transitions between SOAP categories. We also report for the first time common
trajectories in medical dialogue structures that provide valuable insights for
designing `differential diagnosis' systems. Finally, we extensively study the
impact of intent filtering for medical dialogue summarization and observe a
significant boost in performance. We make the codes and data, including
annotation guidelines, publicly available at
https://github.com/DATEXIS/medical-intent-classification.

TL;DR: 这篇论文系统分析了大语言模型如何通过上下文学习和参数高效微调来支持极低资源语言，发现零样本ICL语言对齐在极低资源语言上效果更好，而少样本ICL或PEFT更适合语言资源相对丰富的情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极低资源语言特别是使用稀有写作系统的语言，因缺乏训练数据而很少获得大语言模型的支持，需要研究如何有效地让LLMs学习这些语言。

Method: 系统性评估3个最新多语言LLMs在20种低代表性语言上的表现，比较上下文学习（ICL）和参数高效微调（PEFT）两种方法的效果。

Result: 发现PEFT在语言和写作系统都极度低代表性时有限制，而零样本ICL结合语言对齐在极低资源语言上效果异常突出。

Conclusion: 为极低资源语言实践者提供了指南，如避免在未见写作系统的语言上微调多语言模型，建议根据语言资源水平选择适合的适配方法。

Abstract: Extremely low-resource languages, especially those written in rare scripts,
as shown in Figure 1, remain largely unsupported by large language models
(LLMs). This is due in part to compounding factors such as the lack of training
data. This paper delivers the first comprehensive analysis of whether LLMs can
acquire such languages purely via in-context learning (ICL), with or without
auxiliary alignment signals, and how these methods compare to
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We systematically evaluate 20
under-represented languages across three state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs.
Our findings highlight the limitation of PEFT when both language and its script
are extremely under-represented by the LLM. In contrast, zero-shot ICL with
language alignment is impressively effective on extremely low-resource
languages, while few-shot ICL or PEFT is more beneficial for languages
relatively better represented by LLMs. For LLM practitioners working on
extremely low-resource languages, we summarise guidelines grounded by our
results on adapting LLMs to low-resource languages, e.g., avoiding fine-tuning
a multilingual model on languages of unseen scripts.

Motivation: 艺术品溯源研究对于验证真伪、支持归还和法律主张至关重要，但当前搜索门户依赖精确元数据，限制了探索性搜索，且多语言碎片化数据阻碍了高效检索。

Method: 采用检索增强生成(RAG)框架，结合语义检索和上下文摘要技术，实现对盖蒂溯源索引-德国拍卖记录的10,000条样本进行自然语言和多语言搜索。

Result: 该方法能够有效检索和总结拍卖记录，减少对元数据结构的依赖，为艺术市场档案导航提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Conclusion: 该RAG框架为历史学家和文化遗产专业人士进行历史敏感性研究提供了实用工具，能够有效处理复杂的多语言溯源数据。

Abstract: This research presents a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for
art provenance studies, focusing on the Getty Provenance Index. Provenance
research establishes the ownership history of artworks, which is essential for
verifying authenticity, supporting restitution and legal claims, and
understanding the cultural and historical context of art objects. The process
is complicated by fragmented, multilingual archival data that hinders efficient
retrieval. Current search portals require precise metadata, limiting
exploratory searches. Our method enables natural-language and multilingual
searches through semantic retrieval and contextual summarization, reducing
dependence on metadata structures. We assess RAG's capability to retrieve and
summarize auction records using a 10,000-record sample from the Getty
Provenance Index - German Sales. The results show this approach provides a
scalable solution for navigating art market archives, offering a practical tool
for historians and cultural heritage professionals conducting historically
sensitive research.

Motivation: 当前定量话语分析依赖MAXQDA和NVivo等黑盒软件，影响方法论透明度和研究目标的对齐，需要更透明可控的分析方法。

Method: 使用Python工具链（NLTK、spaCy、Sentence Transformers）进行精细的预处理、词形恢复和嵌入生成，采用迭代式BERTopic模型，包括UMAP降维、HDBSCAN聚类和c-TF-IDF关键词提取，通过参数调优提升主题一致性。

Conclusion: 该研究强调代码层面的透明性、研究人员的主动性和方法论三角测量在计算话语研究中的重要性，提供了一种避免单一方法局限性的多层次分析方法。

Abstract: Quantitative Discourse Analysis has seen growing adoption with the rise of
Large Language Models and computational tools. However, reliance on black box
software such as MAXQDA and NVivo risks undermining methodological transparency
and alignment with research goals. This paper presents a hybrid, transparent
framework for QDA that combines lexical and semantic methods to enable
triangulation, reproducibility, and interpretability. Drawing from a case study
in historical political discourse, we demonstrate how custom Python pipelines
using NLTK, spaCy, and Sentence Transformers allow fine-grained control over
preprocessing, lemmatisation, and embedding generation. We further detail our
iterative BERTopic modelling process, incorporating UMAP dimensionality
reduction, HDBSCAN clustering, and c-TF-IDF keyword extraction, optimised
through parameter tuning and multiple runs to enhance topic coherence and
coverage. By juxtaposing precise lexical searches with context-aware semantic
clustering, we argue for a multi-layered approach that mitigates the
limitations of either method in isolation. Our workflow underscores the
importance of code-level transparency, researcher agency, and methodological
triangulation in computational discourse studies. Code and supplementary

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在视觉问答任务中表现出色但存在幻觉问题，可靠的模型应该能够感知自身的知识边界，知道什么知道什么不知道。

Method: 评估三种置信度信号：概率置信度、答案一致性置信度和语言化置信度；在三个LVLMs和三个VQA数据集上进行实验；从大型语言模型(LLMs)中适配几种置信度校准方法并提出三种有效方法。

Result: LVLMs具有一定程度的感知能力但仍有很大改进空间；概率和一致性置信度信号更可靠，语言化置信度往往导致过度自信；联合处理视觉和文本输入会降低问答性能但减少置信度，相比LLMs提高了感知水平。

Conclusion: LVLMs对知识边界的感知能力有待提升，提出的置信度校准方法能有效改善其感知能力，视觉信息的加入虽然降低性能但提高了模型的自我认知能力。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong visual question
answering (VQA) capabilities but are shown to hallucinate. A reliable model
should perceive its knowledge boundaries-knowing what it knows and what it does
not. This paper investigates LVLMs' perception of their knowledge boundaries by
evaluating three types of confidence signals: probabilistic confidence, answer
consistency-based confidence, and verbalized confidence. Experiments on three
LVLMs across three VQA datasets show that, although LVLMs possess a reasonable
perception level, there is substantial room for improvement. Among the three
confidences, probabilistic and consistency-based signals are more reliable
indicators, while verbalized confidence often leads to overconfidence. To
enhance LVLMs' perception, we adapt several established confidence calibration
methods from Large Language Models (LLMs) and propose three effective methods.
Additionally, we compare LVLMs with their LLM counterparts, finding that
jointly processing visual and textual inputs decreases question-answering
performance but reduces confidence, resulting in an improved perception level
compared to LLMs.

Abstract: Scientific problem solving poses unique challenges for LLMs, requiring both
deep domain knowledge and the ability to apply such knowledge through complex
reasoning. While automated scientific reasoners hold great promise for
assisting human scientists, there is currently no widely adopted holistic
benchmark for evaluating scientific reasoning, and few approaches
systematically disentangle the distinct roles of knowledge and reasoning in
these tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce SciReas, a diverse suite of
existing benchmarks for scientific reasoning tasks, and SciReas-Pro, a
selective subset that requires more complex reasoning. Our holistic evaluation
surfaces insights about scientific reasoning performance that remain hidden
when relying on individual benchmarks alone. We then propose KRUX, a probing
framework for studying the distinct roles of reasoning and knowledge in
scientific tasks. Combining the two, we conduct an in-depth analysis that
yields several key findings: (1) Retrieving task-relevant knowledge from model
parameters is a critical bottleneck for LLMs in scientific reasoning; (2)
Reasoning models consistently benefit from external knowledge added in-context
on top of the reasoning enhancement; (3) Enhancing verbalized reasoning
improves LLMs' ability to surface task-relevant knowledge. Finally, we conduct
a lightweight analysis, comparing our science-focused data composition with
concurrent efforts on long CoT SFT, and release SciLit01, a strong 8B baseline
for scientific reasoning.

TL;DR: VibeVoice是一个使用next-token扩散方法合成多说话人长语音的模型，通过新型连续语音分词器实现80倍数据压缩，能在64K上下文窗口中生成90分钟语音，最多支持4个说话人


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决长语音合成中多说话人对话的挑战，需要开发能够处理长序列并保持音频保真度的高效模型

Method: 采用next-token扩散方法，通过新型连续语音分词器对连续数据进行建模，相比Encodec模型实现80倍数据压缩

Result: 能够合成长达90分钟的多说话人语音（最多4人），在64K上下文窗口长度下超越开源和专有对话模型，保持真实对话氛围

Conclusion: VibeVoice通过创新的分词器和扩散方法，在长语音合成领域实现了显著突破，为多说话人对话生成提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: This report presents VibeVoice, a novel model designed to synthesize
long-form speech with multiple speakers by employing next-token diffusion,
which is a unified method for modeling continuous data by autoregressively
generating latent vectors via diffusion. To enable this, we introduce a novel
continuous speech tokenizer that, when compared to the popular Encodec model,
improves data compression by 80 times while maintaining comparable performance.
The tokenizer effectively preserves audio fidelity while significantly boosting
computational efficiency for processing long sequences. Thus, VibeVoice can
synthesize long-form speech for up to 90 minutes (in a 64K context window
length) with a maximum of 4 speakers, capturing the authentic conversational
``vibe'' and surpassing open-source and proprietary dialogue models.

### [124] [Evaluating the Evaluators: Are readability metrics good measures of readability?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19221)
*Isabel Cachola,Daniel Khashabi,Mark Dredze*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文对Plain Language Summarization（PLS）的可读性评估方法进行了系统调查，发现传统可读性指标（如FKGL）与人类判断相关性差，而语言模型能更好地评估可读性，特别是在背景知识等深层维度上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前PLS领域使用传统可读性指标进行评估，但这些指标在PLS中尚未与人类可读性判断进行系统比较，需要验证其有效性。

Method: 评估了8种传统可读性指标与人类判断的相关性，并测试了语言模型作为可读性评估工具的性能，分析了PLS数据集中的可读性特征。

Result: 大多数传统可读性指标（包括最流行的FKGL）与人类判断相关性差，而最佳语言模型达到0.56的皮尔逊相关系数。语言模型能更好地捕捉背景知识等深层可读性维度。

Conclusion: 建议在PLS评估中使用语言模型替代传统可读性指标，并发布了分析代码和调查数据以供后续研究使用。

Abstract: Plain Language Summarization (PLS) aims to distill complex documents into
accessible summaries for non-expert audiences. In this paper, we conduct a
thorough survey of PLS literature, and identify that the current standard
practice for readability evaluation is to use traditional readability metrics,
such as Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL). However, despite proven utility in
other fields, these metrics have not been compared to human readability
judgments in PLS. We evaluate 8 readability metrics and show that most
correlate poorly with human judgments, including the most popular metric, FKGL.
We then show that Language Models (LMs) are better judges of readability, with
the best-performing model achieving a Pearson correlation of 0.56 with human
judgments. Extending our analysis to PLS datasets, which contain summaries
aimed at non-expert audiences, we find that LMs better capture deeper measures
of readability, such as required background knowledge, and lead to different
conclusions than the traditional metrics. Based on these findings, we offer
recommendations for best practices in the evaluation of plain language
summaries. We release our analysis code and survey data.

TL;DR: 提出生成式界面范式，让LLM主动生成用户界面而非传统对话响应，在多轮、信息密集和探索性任务中显著提升交互效率和用户体验


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统线性请求-响应格式的对话系统在多轮、信息密集和探索性任务中效率低下，限制了LLM作为助手、副驾驶和顾问的潜力

Method: 提出生成式语言模型界面框架，利用结构化界面特定表示和迭代优化，将用户查询转换为任务特定的用户界面

Result: 生成式界面在70%以上的情况下被人类用户偏好，在功能、交互和情感体验维度上均优于传统对话界面

Conclusion: 生成式界面范式为人类-AI交互的未来发展指明了方向，明确了用户偏好生成式界面的时机和原因

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly seen as assistants, copilots,
and consultants, capable of supporting a wide range of tasks through natural
conversation. However, most systems remain constrained by a linear
request-response format that often makes interactions inefficient in
multi-turn, information-dense, and exploratory tasks. To address these
limitations, we propose Generative Interfaces for Language Models, a paradigm
in which LLMs respond to user queries by proactively generating user interfaces
(UIs) that enable more adaptive and interactive engagement. Our framework
leverages structured interface-specific representations and iterative
refinements to translate user queries into task-specific UIs. For systematic
evaluation, we introduce a multidimensional assessment framework that compares
generative interfaces with traditional chat-based ones across diverse tasks,
interaction patterns, and query types, capturing functional, interactive, and
emotional aspects of user experience. Results show that generative interfaces
consistently outperform conversational ones, with humans preferring them in
over 70% of cases. These findings clarify when and why users favor generative
interfaces, paving the way for future advancements in human-AI interaction.

TL;DR: 本文研究分配平台中如何通过鼓励代理人放松限制来提高整体效用，同时保证不损害代理人利益，并提出了多项式时间算法来解决相关优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源分配平台中，分配协调员希望通过鼓励代理人放松某些限制来提高整体社会福利，但需要确保这种建议不会损害代理人的利益，同时受到预算约束的限制。

Method: 提出了形式化的问题定义和参与保证层次结构，针对一对一和一对多分配设置开发了多项式时间算法，并在三个真实数据集上进行了广泛实验验证。

Result: 研究展示了促进放松限制的好处，证明了不同参与保证机制的影响，算法在多项式时间内有效解决了优化问题。

Conclusion: 通过适当的促进机制和算法设计，可以在不损害代理人利益的前提下有效提高分配系统的整体社会福利，为实际分配平台提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We consider a setting where goods are allocated to agents by way of an
allocation platform (e.g., a matching platform). An ``allocation facilitator''
aims to increase the overall utility/social-good of the allocation by
encouraging (some of the) agents to relax (some of) their restrictions. At the
same time, the advice must not hurt agents who would otherwise be better off.
Additionally, the facilitator may be constrained by a ``bound'' (a.k.a.
`budget'), limiting the number and/or type of restrictions it may seek to
relax. We consider the facilitator's optimization problem of choosing an
optimal set of restrictions to request to relax under the aforementioned
constraints. Our contributions are three-fold: (i) We provide a formal
definition of the problem, including the participation guarantees to which the
facilitator should adhere. We define a hierarchy of participation guarantees
and also consider several social-good functions. (ii) We provide polynomial
algorithms for solving various versions of the associated optimization
problems, including one-to-one and many-to-one allocation settings. (iii) We
demonstrate the benefits of such facilitation and relaxation, and the
implications of the different participation guarantees, using extensive
experimentation on three real-world datasets.

Result: 对四种图优化问题的核心稳定性验证和存在性问题进行了算法复杂性分析

Conclusion: 该研究为组合优化游戏中的核心稳定性问题提供了系统的计算复杂性分析框架

Abstract: We propose a class of cooperative games, called d Partitioned Compbinatorial
Optimization Games (PCOGs). The input of PCOG consists of a set of agents and a
combinatorial structure (typically a graph) with a fixed optimization goal on
this structure (e.g., finding a minimum dominating set on a graph) such that
the structure is divided among the agents. The value of each coalition of
agents is derived from the optimal solution for the part of the structure
possessed by the coalition. We study two fundamental questions related to the
core: Core Stability Verification and Core Stability Existence. We analyze the
algorithmic complexity of both questions for four classic graph optimization
tasks: minimum vertex cover, minimum dominating set, minimum spanning tree, and
maximum matching.

Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLM)在模拟人类决策时存在内在偏见，与真实人类行为存在差异，限制了其反映人口层面多样性的能力

Method: 采用基于人格的方法，利用行为经济学中的个体层面行为数据来调整模型偏见，在最后通牒游戏这一标准基准上进行测试

Result: 观察到模拟行为与实证行为之间的对齐度得到改善，特别是在响应者方面表现更好

Conclusion: 虽然还需要进一步完善特质表征，但人格条件化的LLM在规模化模拟类人决策模式方面展现出良好前景

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate human
decision-making, but their intrinsic biases often diverge from real human
behavior--limiting their ability to reflect population-level diversity. We
address this challenge with a persona-based approach that leverages
individual-level behavioral data from behavioral economics to adjust model
biases. Applying this method to the ultimatum game--a standard but difficult
benchmark for LLMs--we observe improved alignment between simulated and
empirical behavior, particularly on the responder side. While further
refinement of trait representations is needed, our results demonstrate the
promise of persona-conditioned LLMs for simulating human-like decision patterns
at scale.

Motivation: 现有可执行运行时环境稀缺，限制了ML智能体的训练进展，需要可扩展和通用的执行基础环境来训练更强大的LLM智能体。

Method: 开发CTF-Dojo大规模可执行运行时环境，包含658个容器化的CTF挑战；创建CTF-Forge自动化流水线，将公开资源快速转换为可执行环境；使用486条执行验证的高质量轨迹训练LLM智能体。

Result: 在InterCode-CTF、NYU CTF Bench和Cybench三个基准测试中取得最高11.6%的绝对提升；32B模型达到31.9% Pass@1，创下开源权重模型新SOTA，媲美前沿模型。

Conclusion: CTF风格任务可作为可执行智能体学习的基准，执行基础训练信号对推进高性能ML智能体发展至关重要，且不依赖昂贵的专有系统。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities when
trained within executable runtime environments, notably excelling at software
engineering tasks through verified feedback loops. Yet, scalable and
generalizable execution-grounded environments remain scarce, limiting progress
in training more capable ML agents. We introduce CTF-Dojo, the first
large-scale executable runtime tailored for training LLMs with verifiable
feedback, featuring 658 fully functional Capture-The-Flag (CTF)-style
challenges containerized in Docker with guaranteed reproducibility. To enable
rapid scaling without manual intervention, we develop CTF-Forge, an automated
pipeline that transforms publicly available artifacts into ready-to-use
execution environments in minutes, eliminating weeks of expert configuration
traditionally required. We trained LLM-based agents on just 486 high-quality,
execution-verified trajectories from CTF-Dojo, achieving up to 11.6% absolute
gains over strong baselines across three competitive benchmarks: InterCode-CTF,
NYU CTF Bench, and Cybench. Our best-performing 32B model reaches 31.9% Pass@1,
establishing a new open-weight state-of-the-art that rivals frontier models
like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Gemini-2.5-Flash. By framing CTF-style tasks as a
benchmark for executable-agent learning, CTF-Dojo demonstrates that
execution-grounded training signals are not only effective but pivotal in
advancing high-performance ML agents without dependence on costly proprietary
systems.

Result: 发现LLM困惑度峰值与人类困惑的神经生理反应在位置和幅度上高度相关

Conclusion: LLM和人类对代码的困惑模式相似，可以基于LLM开发数据驱动的方法来识别代码中可能引起人类困惑的区域

Abstract: Already today, humans and programming assistants based on large language
models (LLMs) collaborate in everyday programming tasks. Clearly, a
misalignment between how LLMs and programmers comprehend code can lead to
misunderstandings, inefficiencies, low code quality, and bugs.
  A key question in this space is whether humans and LLMs are confused by the
same kind of code. This would not only guide our choices of integrating LLMs in
software engineering workflows, but also inform about possible improvements of
LLMs.
  To this end, we conducted an empirical study comparing an LLM to human
programmers comprehending clean and confusing code. We operationalized
comprehension for the LLM by using LLM perplexity, and for human programmers
using neurophysiological responses (in particular, EEG-based fixation-related
potentials).
  We found that LLM perplexity spikes correlate both in terms of location and
amplitude with human neurophysiological responses that indicate confusion. This
result suggests that LLMs and humans are similarly confused about the code.
Based on these findings, we devised a data-driven, LLM-based approach to
identify regions of confusion in code that elicit confusion in human
programmers.

TL;DR: LaQual是一个自动化评估LLM应用质量的框架，通过分层分类、静态指标筛选和动态场景自适应评估三阶段方法，能有效识别高质量应用，实验显示与人工评估高度一致且显著提升用户体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM应用商店的排名推荐主要依赖用户活跃度和收藏等静态指标，难以帮助用户高效找到高质量应用，需要更有效的质量评估方法。

Method: 三阶段框架：1) 分层分类LLM应用以匹配不同场景；2) 使用时序加权用户参与度和功能能力指标等静态指标筛选低质量应用；3) 进行动态场景自适应评估，由LLM生成场景特定的评估指标、评分规则和任务进行综合质量评估。

Result: 实验显示LaQual自动化评分与人工判断高度一致（法律咨询Spearman's rho=0.62，旅行规划rho=0.60），能减少66.7%-81.3%的候选应用。用户研究显示在决策信心、比较效率（5.45 vs 3.30）和评估报告价值感知（4.75 vs 2.25）方面显著优于基线系统。

Conclusion: LaQual提供了一个可扩展、客观且以用户为中心的解决方案，能够在实际使用场景中有效发现和推荐高质量的LLM应用。

Abstract: LLM app stores are quickly emerging as platforms that gather a wide range of
intelligent applications based on LLMs, giving users many choices for content
creation, coding support, education, and more. However, the current methods for
ranking and recommending apps in these stores mostly rely on static metrics
like user activity and favorites, which makes it hard for users to efficiently
find high-quality apps. To address these challenges, we propose LaQual, an
automated framework for evaluating the quality of LLM apps. LaQual consists of
three main stages: first, it labels and classifies LLM apps in a hierarchical
way to accurately match them to different scenarios; second, it uses static
indicators, such as time-weighted user engagement and functional capability
metrics, to filter out low-quality apps; and third, it conducts a dynamic,
scenario-adaptive evaluation, where the LLM itself generates scenario-specific
evaluation metrics, scoring rules, and tasks for a thorough quality assessment.
Experiments on a popular LLM app store show that LaQual is effective. Its
automated scores are highly consistent with human judgments (with Spearman's
rho of 0.62 and p=0.006 in legal consulting, and rho of 0.60 and p=0.009 in
travel planning). By effectively screening, LaQual can reduce the pool of
candidate LLM apps by 66.7% to 81.3%. User studies further confirm that LaQual
significantly outperforms baseline systems in decision confidence, comparison
efficiency (with average scores of 5.45 compared to 3.30), and the perceived
value of its evaluation reports (4.75 versus 2.25). Overall, these results
demonstrate that LaQual offers a scalable, objective, and user-centered
solution for finding and recommending high-quality LLM apps in real-world use
cases.

Conclusion: 该框架朝着实现可靠、自动生成软件的长期愿景迈出了有希望的一步

Abstract: Automated code generation has long been considered the holy grail of software
engineering. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed a
revolutionary breakthrough in this area. However, existing methods that only
rely on LLMs remain inadequate in the quality of generated code, offering no
guarantees of satisfying practical requirements. They lack a systematic
strategy for requirements development and modeling. Recently, LLM-based agents
typically possess powerful abilities and play an essential role in facilitating
the alignment of LLM outputs with user requirements. In this paper, we envision
the first multi-agent framework for reliable code generation based on
\textsc{re}quirements \textsc{de}velopment and \textsc{fo}rmalization, named
\textsc{ReDeFo}. This framework incorporates three agents, highlighting their
augmentation with knowledge and techniques of formal methods, into the
requirements-to-code generation pipeline to strengthen quality assurance. The
core of \textsc{ReDeFo} is the use of formal specifications to bridge the gap
between potentially ambiguous natural language requirements and precise
executable code. \textsc{ReDeFo} enables rigorous reasoning about correctness,
uncovering hidden bugs, and enforcing critical properties throughout the
development process. In general, our framework aims to take a promising step
toward realizing the long-standing vision of reliable, auto-generated software.

Motivation: 传统动态数据依赖分析方法需要完整插桩或程序重放，成本高昂且对非确定性程序不可行，需要一种更高效的解决方案

Method: 利用LLM从部分记录的执行痕迹和代码上下文中推断程序行为，恢复缺失的执行信息，支持隐式变量，处理运行时值恢复和内存对齐

Result: 在三个切片基准测试的8300个数据依赖上，准确率达到80.3%、91.1%、98.3%，显著优于最佳基线方法，召回率也领先

Conclusion: RecovSlicing能够高效计算动态数据依赖，集成到回归错误定位器中可发现更多回归问题，为调试提供有力支持

Abstract: Dynamic data dependency, answering "why a variable has this value?", is
critical for debugging. Given a program step `s` reading a variable `v`,
finding the dynamic definition of `v` is challenging. Traditional methods
require either (1) exhaustive instrumentation of all possible definitions of
`v` in one run or (2) replicating the run to re-examine reads/writes - both
costly. If `v` is defined in a library, instrumentation becomes expensive; for
non-deterministic programs, replication is infeasible.
  We propose RecovSlicing, which computes dynamic data dependency in a single
run with partial instrumentation. We leverage LLMs to infer program behavior
from a partially recorded trace and code context. Given a trace and a slicing
criterion (step `s` and variable `v`), RecovSlicing estimates the runtime
definition of `v` by recovering the missing execution.It also supports implicit
variables, such as those in `list.get(i)`. Technically, RecovSlicing tackles:
(1) recovering runtime values and structures, and (2) aligning recovered
variables with recorded memory to analyze definitions.
  We evaluate RecovSlicing on 8,300 data dependencies across three slicing
benchmarks, comparing it with Slicer4J, ND-Slicer, LLM Slicer, and re-execution
Slicer. RecovSlicing achieves accuracy of 80.3%, 91.1%, and 98.3%,
outperforming the best baseline (39.0%, 82.0%, 59.9%), and also leads in recall
(91.1%, 91.1%, 98.3% vs. 53.4%, 79.1%, 87.1%). Integrated into a regression bug
localizer, it enables finding 16% more regressions.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究分析16款AI代码审查工具在22,000多个审查评论中的影响力，发现简洁、包含代码片段的手动触发评论更有效


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然AI基于代码审查工具逐渐普及，但它们的实际影响力仍不明确，需要大规模实证研究来评估其效果

Method: 开发了两阶段LLM辅助框架来判断审查评论是否被处理，并使用可解释的机器学习方法识别影响因素

Result: 采用率在增长但效果差异较大；简洁、包含代码片段的手动触发评论（尤其是hunk-level工具）更容易导致代码变更

Conclusion: 细心的工具设计对于AI代码审查系统的效果至关重要，研究结果为改进AI基于代码审查系统提供了方向

Abstract: AI-based code review tools automatically review and comment on pull requests
to improve code quality. Despite their growing presence, little is known about
their actual impact. We present a large-scale empirical study of 16 popular
AI-based code review actions for GitHub workflows, analyzing more than 22,000
review comments in 178 repositories. We investigate (1) how these tools are
adopted and configured, (2) whether their comments lead to code changes, and
(3) which factors influence their effectiveness. We develop a two-stage
LLM-assisted framework to determine whether review comments are addressed, and
use interpretable machine learning to identify influencing factors. Our
findings show that, while adoption is growing, effectiveness varies widely.
Comments that are concise, contain code snippets, and are manually triggered,
particularly those from hunk-level review tools, are more likely to result in
code changes. These results highlight the importance of careful tool design and
suggest directions for improving AI-based code review systems.

*Sabato Nocera,Davide Fucci,Giuseppe Scanniello*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究通过挖掘GitHub项目发现，虽然大部分项目使用SonarQube Cloud预设配置，但仍有45%项目会自定义质量门條件来满足特定质量目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查开源项目如何使用和自定义静态代码分析工具SonarQube Cloud，以了解实际使用情况和配置习惯。

Method: 通过挖掘GitHub项目数据，分析321个使用SonarQube Cloud的GitHub项目，重点关注它们与SonarQube Cloud项目的连接情况和质量门配置。

Result: 81%项目正确连接到SonarQube Cloud，75%使用组织默认质量门，55%使用内置质量门，45%自定义质量门条件。最常见的质量条件包括安全性、可维护性、可靠性、覆盖率和代码重复检查。

Conclusion: 许多项目依赖预定义配置，但仍有较大比例自定义配置以满足特定质量目标。未来研究应链接质量门配置与实际软件效果，为不同场景提供基于证据的SCA工具配置建议。

Abstract: Background: Static Code Analysis (SCA) tools are widely adopted to enforce
code quality standards. However, little is known about how open-source projects
use and customize these tools. Aims: This paper investigates how GitHub
projects use and customize a popular SCA tool, namely SonarQube Cloud. Method:
We conducted a mining study of GitHub projects that are linked through GitHub
Actions to SonarQube Cloud projects. Results: Among 321 GitHub projects using
SonarQube Cloud, 81% of them are correctly connected to SonarQube Cloud
projects, while others exhibit misconfigurations or restricted access. Among
265 accessible SonarQube Cloud projects, 75% use the organization's default
quality gate, i.e., a set of conditions that deployed source code must meet to
pass automated checks. While 55% of the projects use the built-in quality gate
provided by SonarQube Cloud, 45% of them customize their quality gate with
different conditions. Overall, the most common quality conditions align with
SonarQube Cloud's "Clean as You Code" principle and enforce security,
maintainability, reliability, coverage, and a few duplicates on newly added or
modified source code. Conclusions: Many projects rely on predefined
configurations, yet a significant portion customize their configurations to
meet specific quality goals. Building on our initial results, we envision a
future research agenda linking quality gate configurations to actual software
outcomes (e.g., improvement of software security). This would enable
evidence-based recommendations for configuring SCA tools like SonarQube Cloud
in various contexts.

### [139] [Interleaving Large Language Models for Compiler Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18955)
*Yunbo Ni,Shaohua Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出LegoFuzz框架，通过离线生成代码片段和在线组合的方式，高效测试C编译器，发现66个GCC和LLVM的严重错误


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于AI的编译器测试方法存在两个问题：生成的测试程序过于简单，以及使用大语言模型进行广泛测试计算成本过高

Method: 将测试过程分为离线阶段和在线阶段：离线阶段使用LLM生成小型但功能丰富的代码片段；在线阶段策略性地组合这些代码片段构建高质量测试程序

Result: 在GCC和LLVM中发现66个错误，其中近一半是现有LLM工具无法发现的严重错误编译错误

Conclusion: 这种高效设计为在软件测试中超越C编译器使用AI模型开辟了新可能性

Abstract: Testing compilers with AI models, especially large language models (LLMs),
has shown great promise. However, current approaches struggle with two key
problems: The generated programs for testing compilers are often too simple,
and extensive testing with the LLMs is computationally expensive. In this
paper, we propose a novel compiler testing framework that decouples the testing
process into two distinct phases: an offline phase and an online phase. In the
offline phase, we use LLMs to generate a collection of small but feature-rich
code pieces. In the online phase, we reuse these code pieces by strategically
combining them to build high-quality and valid test programs, which are then
used to test compilers.
  We implement this idea in a tool, LegoFuzz, for testing C compilers. The
results are striking: we found 66 bugs in GCC and LLVM, the most widely used C
compilers. Almost half of the bugs are miscompilation bugs, which are serious
and hard-to-find bugs that none of the existing LLM-based tools could find. We
believe this efficient design opens up new possibilities for using AI models in
software testing beyond just C compilers.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: GitTaskBench是一个新的基准测试，通过54个真实任务评估代码代理在GitHub等大型代码库中的实际工作能力，发现即使最佳系统也只能解决48.15%的任务，突显了工作流管理和环境设置的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试很少评估代码代理在真实工作流驱动的代码库场景中的能力，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 引入GitTaskBench基准，包含54个跨7个模态和7个领域的真实任务，每个任务配有相关代码库和自动化评估工具，并提出alpha-value经济价值指标。

Result: 实验显示即使最佳系统OpenHands+Claude 3.7也只能解决48.15%的任务，超过一半的失败源于环境设置和依赖解析等看似简单但关键的步骤。

Conclusion: 代码代理在处理复杂代码库任务时仍面临挑战，需要更强大的工作流管理和超时准备，该基准旨在推动代码库感知的代码推理和执行能力发展。

Abstract: Beyond scratch coding, exploiting large-scale code repositories (e.g.,
GitHub) for practical tasks is vital in real-world software development, yet
current benchmarks rarely evaluate code agents in such authentic,
workflow-driven scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce GitTaskBench, a
benchmark designed to systematically assess this capability via 54 realistic
tasks across 7 modalities and 7 domains. Each task pairs a relevant repository
with an automated, human-curated evaluation harness specifying practical
success criteria. Beyond measuring execution and task success, we also propose
the alpha-value metric to quantify the economic benefit of agent performance,
which integrates task success rates, token cost, and average developer
salaries. Experiments across three state-of-the-art agent frameworks with
multiple advanced LLMs show that leveraging code repositories for complex task
solving remains challenging: even the best-performing system, OpenHands+Claude
3.7, solves only 48.15% of tasks. Error analysis attributes over half of
failures to seemingly mundane yet critical steps like environment setup and
dependency resolution, highlighting the need for more robust workflow
management and increased timeout preparedness. By releasing GitTaskBench, we
aim to drive progress and attention toward repository-aware code reasoning,
execution, and deployment -- moving agents closer to solving complex,
end-to-end real-world tasks. The benchmark and code are open-sourced at
https://github.com/QuantaAlpha/GitTaskBench.

### [141] [A Slice-Based Change Impact Analysis for Regression Test Case Prioritization of Object-Oriented Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19056)
*S. Panda,D. Munjal,D. P. Mohapatra*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种静态测试用例优先级排序方法，通过计算受影响组件耦合度(ACC)来识别故障易发部件，并优先执行覆盖这些部件的测试用例，以提高故障检测效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试用例优先级排序可以通过优先执行能够更早发现故障的测试用例，节省重测时间和成本。需要找到一种有效的方法来识别程序中故障易发的部分。

Method: 构建受影响切片图(ASG)表示受影响的程序部分，计算每个节点的受影响组件耦合度(ACC)值来评估故障易发性。将优先级赋予覆盖高ACC值节点的测试用例。

Result: 通过答强变异故障分析和4个案例研究验证，证明该方法能够更早地检测到故障，且性能表现可接受。

Conclusion: 该静态测试用例优先级方法是可行的，在对比现有技术时表现出良好的性能，能够有效提高测试效率。

Abstract: Test case prioritization focuses on finding a suitable order of execution of
the test cases in a test suite to meet some performance goals like detecting
faults early. It is likely that some test cases execute the program parts that
are more prone to errors and will detect more errors if executed early during
the testing process. Finding an optimal order of execution for the selected
regression test cases saves time and cost of retesting. This paper presents a
static approach to prioritizing the test cases by computing the affected
component coupling (ACC) of the affected parts of object-oriented programs. We
construct a graph named affected slice graph (ASG) to represent these affected
program parts.We determine the fault-proneness of the nodes of ASG by computing
their respective ACC values. We assign higher priority to those test cases that
cover the nodes with higher ACC values. Our analysis with mutation faults shows
that the test cases executing the fault-prone program parts have a higher
chance to reveal faults earlier than other test cases in the test suite. The
result obtained from seven case studies justifies that our approach is feasible
and gives acceptable performance in comparison to some existing techniques.

*Pinhuan Wang,Zhiqiu Xia,Chunhua Liao,Feiyi Wang,Hang Liu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: REALM是一个基于不确定性建模的LLM重排序框架，通过高斯分布建模相关性并使用贝叶斯更新，在减少token消耗的同时提升了重排序性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的重排序方法存在排名不确定性、top-k恢复不稳定和token成本高等问题，需要更高效可靠的解决方案

Method: 提出REALM框架，将LLM生成的相关性建模为高斯分布，通过递归贝叶斯更新进行细化，显式捕捉不确定性并最小化冗余查询

Result: 实验结果表明REALM在超越最先进重排序器的同时，显著减少了token使用和延迟

Conclusion: REALM作为下一代重排序器，为现代信息检索系统提供了更高效可靠的解决方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in document
re-ranking, a key component in modern Information Retrieval (IR) systems.
However, existing LLM-based approaches face notable limitations, including
ranking uncertainty, unstable top-k recovery, and high token cost due to
token-intensive prompting. To effectively address these limitations, we propose
REALM, an uncertainty-aware re-ranking framework that models LLM-derived
relevance as Gaussian distributions and refines them through recursive Bayesian
updates. By explicitly capturing uncertainty and minimizing redundant queries,
REALM achieves better rankings more efficiently. Experimental results
demonstrate that our REALM surpasses state-of-the-art re-rankers while
significantly reducing token usage and latency, promoting it as the
next-generation re-ranker for modern IR systems.

### [143] [DenseRec: Revisiting Dense Content Embeddings for Sequential Transformer-based Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18442)
*Jan Malte Lichtenberg,Antonio De Candia,Matteo Ruffini*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: DenseRec通过双路径嵌入方法，将稠密内容嵌入线性投影到ID嵌入空间，有效解决了基于Transformer的序列推荐器在物品冷启动问题上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于Transformer的序列推荐器（如SASRec、BERT4Rec）仅依赖学习到的物品ID嵌入，在面对动态物品目录时容易受到物品冷启动问题的影响。虽然预训练模型的稠密内容嵌入提供了潜在解决方案，但直接集成到Transformer推荐器中始终表现不如纯ID方法。

Method: 提出DenseRec方法，采用双路径嵌入方式。在训练期间学习从稠密嵌入空间到ID嵌入空间的线性投影，使得模型能够无缝泛化到未见过的物品，无需专门的嵌入模型或复杂的基础设施。

Result: 在三个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，DenseRec始终优于纯ID的SASRec基线，即使没有额外的超参数调优且使用紧凑的嵌入模型。分析显示改进主要来自于在存在未见物品时更好的序列表示。

Conclusion: DenseRec为冷启动序列推荐提供了一个实用且鲁棒的解决方案，通过简单的线性投影实现了对未见物品的有效处理，显著提升了推荐性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based sequential recommenders, such as SASRec or BERT4Rec,
typically rely solely on learned item ID embeddings, making them vulnerable to
the item cold-start problem, particularly in environments with dynamic item
catalogs. While dense content embeddings from pre-trained models offer
potential solutions, direct integration into transformer-based recommenders has
consistently underperformed compared to ID-only approaches. We revisit this
integration challenge and propose DenseRec, a simple yet effective method that
introduces a dual-path embedding approach. DenseRec learns a linear projection
from the dense embedding space into the ID embedding space during training,
enabling seamless generalization to previously unseen items without requiring
specialized embedding models or complex infrastructure. In experiments on three
real-world datasets, we find DenseRec to consistently outperform an ID-only
SASRec baseline, even without additional hyperparameter tuning and while using
compact embedding models. Our analysis suggests improvements primarily arise
from better sequence representations in the presence of unseen items,
positioning DenseRec as a practical and robust solution for cold-start
sequential recommendation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了改进科学论文的系统性综述过程，需要有效处理表格数据来增强提取式问答能力，开发相应的软件工具。

Method: 评估了三种方法：(1)光学字符识别(OCR)提取信息；(2)预训练模型进行文档视觉问答；(3)表格检测和结构识别，将表格信息与文本内容合并来回答问题。

Result: 保持表格结构完整性的方法表现最优，特别是在表示和组织表格内容方面。准确识别文档中的特定符号和标记对结果改善至关重要。

Conclusion: 保持表格的结构完整性对于提高科学文档中提取式问答的准确性和可靠性至关重要。

Abstract: This study explores three approaches to processing table data in scientific
papers to enhance extractive question answering and develop a software tool for
the systematic review process. The methods evaluated include: (1) Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) for extracting information from documents, (2)
Pre-trained models for document visual question answering, and (3) Table
detection and structure recognition to extract and merge key information from
tables with textual content to answer extractive questions. In exploratory
experiments, we augmented ten sample test documents containing tables and
relevant content against RF- EMF-related scientific papers with seven
predefined extractive question-answer pairs. The results indicate that
approaches preserving table structure outperform the others, particularly in
representing and organizing table content. Accurately recognizing specific
notations and symbols within the documents emerged as a critical factor for
improved results. Our study concludes that preserving the structural integrity
of tables is essential for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of extractive
question answering in scientific documents.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了基于大语言模型的推荐系统中的成员推断攻击风险，设计了四种攻击方法并证实了隐私泄漏的实际威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于LLM的推荐系统通过上下文学习使用包含敏感用户历史交互的提示词，这些私人信息可能面临新型隐私攻击风险，但目前还没有研究深入分析这一问题。

Method: 设计了四种成员推断攻击方法：直接询问、幻觉、相似性和毒化攻击，每种方法都利用了LLM或推荐系统的特有特性。在三个LLM模型和两个标准推荐数据集上进行了详细评估。

Result: 结果证实了LLM推荐系统面临实际的MIA威胁：直接询问和毒化攻击显示出显著高的攻击优势。还分析了影响攻击效果的因素，如提示中的示例数量和受害者在示例中的位置。

Conclusion: 这项研究首次揭示了LLM基推荐系统在隐私保护方面的漏洞，证明成员推断攻击是一种实际的威胁，为后续安全防护措施的发展提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Recommender Systems (RecSys) can flexibly
adapt recommendation systems to different domains. It utilizes in-context
learning (ICL), i.e., the prompts, to customize the recommendation functions,
which include sensitive historical user-specific item interactions, e.g.,
implicit feedback like clicked items or explicit product reviews. Such private
information may be exposed to novel privacy attack. However, no study has been
done on this important issue. We design four membership inference attacks
(MIAs), aiming to reveal whether victims' historical interactions have been
used by system prompts. They are \emph{direct inquiry, hallucination,
similarity, and poisoning attacks}, each of which utilizes the unique features
of LLMs or RecSys. We have carefully evaluated them on three LLMs that have
been used to develop ICL-LLM RecSys and two well-known RecSys benchmark
datasets. The results confirm that the MIA threat on LLM RecSys is realistic:
direct inquiry and poisoning attacks showing significantly high attack
advantages. We have also analyzed the factors affecting these attacks, such as
the number of shots in system prompts and the position of the victim in the
shots.

TL;DR: 提出一种新的两阶段训练策略，通过对比颇损预训练提高ID基嵌入的泛化能力，解决推荐系统中的"单运行问题"


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ID基嵌入在网络规模在线推荐系统中容易过拟合的问题，特别是因数据长尾分布导致的单运行限制

Method: 使用最小模型进行对比颇损预训练的两阶段训练策略，实现更广泛的数据覆盖

Result: 预训练阶段多运行训练不会导致过拟合，嵌入在复杂下游任务中显著提升泛化能力，实际部署在Pinterest获得显著的站点活跃度增长

Conclusion: 该两阶段训练方法有效解决了ID基嵌入的过拟合问题，为大规模推荐系统提供了更好的泛化性能

Abstract: ID-based embeddings are widely used in web-scale online recommendation
systems. However, their susceptibility to overfitting, particularly due to the
long-tail nature of data distributions, often limits training to a single
epoch, a phenomenon known as the "one-epoch problem." This challenge has driven
research efforts to optimize performance within the first epoch by enhancing
convergence speed or feature sparsity. In this study, we introduce a novel
two-stage training strategy that incorporates a pre-training phase using a
minimal model with contrastive loss, enabling broader data coverage for the
embedding system. Our offline experiments demonstrate that multi-epoch training
during the pre-training phase does not lead to overfitting, and the resulting
embeddings improve online generalization when fine-tuned for more complex
downstream recommendation tasks. We deployed the proposed system in live
traffic at Pinterest, achieving significant site-wide engagement gains.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出基于博弈论的潜在空间压缩框架，在保持语义相似性的同时提升向量搜索效率，相比FAISS显著提高相似度和效用值


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代信息检索系统中基于transformer的向量相似性搜索面临高维表示带来的可扩展性和效率问题，需要优化潜在空间压缩来平衡检索精度和存储效率

Method: 将压缩策略建模为检索精度和存储效率之间的零和博弈，推导出能够保持语义相似性同时减少冗余的潜在变换方法

Result: 相比FAISS库，该方法实现了显著更高的平均相似度(0.9981 vs 0.5517)和效用值(0.8873 vs 0.5194)，查询时间略有增加

Conclusion: 博弈论潜在压缩在高效用、基于transformer的搜索应用中具有实用价值，可无缝集成到现有LLM流程中，实现更语义准确和计算高效的检索

Abstract: Vector similarity search plays a pivotal role in modern information retrieval
systems, especially when powered by transformer-based embeddings. However, the
scalability and efficiency of such systems are often hindered by the high
dimensionality of latent representations. In this paper, we propose a novel
game-theoretic framework for optimizing latent-space compression to enhance
both the efficiency and semantic utility of vector search. By modeling the
compression strategy as a zero-sum game between retrieval accuracy and storage
efficiency, we derive a latent transformation that preserves semantic
similarity while reducing redundancy. We benchmark our method against FAISS, a
widely-used vector search library, and demonstrate that our approach achieves a
significantly higher average similarity (0.9981 vs. 0.5517) and utility (0.8873
vs. 0.5194), albeit with a modest increase in query time. This trade-off
highlights the practical value of game-theoretic latent compression in
high-utility, transformer-based search applications. The proposed system can be
seamlessly integrated into existing LLM pipelines to yield more semantically
accurate and computationally efficient retrieval.

*Edgar Rangel,Fabio Martinez*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个基于联邦学习的协作框架，用于分割DWI序列中的缺血性卒中病灶，通过共享深度中心无关表征知识，在14个医疗中心的2031个研究中实现了优于集中式和其他联邦学习方法的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卒中是全球第二大死因和第三大致残原因。虽然临床指南将DWI作为定位、表征和测量梗死体积的标准，但由于患者人口统计、扫描设备和专家标注的差异，病灶分析存在高度变异性。现有的计算方法通常只从单一机构学习模式，缺乏泛化能力，且许多临床中心缺乏足够的标注样本。

Method: 开发了一个协作框架，通过联邦平均（FedAvg）方法共享来自深度中心无关表征的知识，在14个模拟医疗中心的2031个研究数据上进行训练。

Result: FedAvg模型在所有中心上实现了DSC为0.71±0.24，AVD为5.29±22.74，ALD为2.16±3.60，LF1为0.70±0.26的总体性能，优于集中式和其他联邦学习规则。模型展现出强大的泛化能力，在不同病灶类别上表现一致，在分布外中心上无需额外训练即可获得DSC 0.64±0.29和AVD 4.44±8.74的可靠性能。

Conclusion: 该联邦学习框架通过共享深度中心无关表征，成功解决了卒中病灶分割中的机构间变异性问题，实现了良好的泛化性能，为缺乏标注数据的临床中心提供了有效的计算支持方案。

Abstract: Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of
disability worldwide. Clinical guidelines establish diffusion resonance imaging
(DWI, ADC) as the standard for localizing, characterizing, and measuring
infarct volume, enabling treatment support and prognosis. Nonetheless, such
lesion analysis is highly variable due to different patient demographics,
scanner vendors, and expert annotations. Computational support approaches have
been key to helping with the localization and segmentation of lesions. However,
these strategies are dedicated solutions that learn patterns from only one
institution, lacking the variability to generalize geometrical lesions shape
models. Even worse, many clinical centers lack sufficient labeled samples to
adjust these dedicated solutions. This work developed a collaborative framework
for segmenting ischemic stroke lesions in DWI sequences by sharing knowledge
from deep center-independent representations. From 14 emulated healthcare
centers with 2031 studies, the FedAvg model achieved a general DSC of $0.71 \pm
0.24$, AVD of $5.29 \pm 22.74$, ALD of $2.16 \pm 3.60$ and LF1 of $0.70 \pm
0.26$ over all centers, outperforming both the centralized and other federated
rules. Interestingly, the model demonstrated strong generalization properties,
showing uniform performance across different lesion categories and reliable
performance in out-of-distribution centers (with DSC of $0.64 \pm 0.29$ and AVD
of $4.44 \pm 8.74$ without any additional training).

Abstract: The development of artificial intelligence models for macular edema (ME)
analy-sis always relies on expert-annotated pixel-level image datasets which
are expen-sive to collect prospectively. While anomaly-detection-based
weakly-supervised methods have shown promise in edema area (EA) segmentation
task, their per-formance still lags behind fully-supervised approaches. In this
paper, we leverage the strong correlation between EA and retinal layers in
spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images, along with the
update characteristics of weakly-supervised learning, to enhance an
off-the-shelf adversarial framework for EA segmentation with a novel
layer-structure-guided post-processing step and a test-time-adaptation (TTA)
strategy. By incorporating additional retinal lay-er information, our framework
reframes the dense EA prediction task as one of confirming intersection points
between the EA contour and retinal layers, result-ing in predictions that
better align with the shape prior of EA. Besides, the TTA framework further
helps address discrepancies in the manifestations and presen-tations of EA
between training and test sets. Extensive experiments on two pub-licly
available datasets demonstrate that these two proposed ingredients can im-prove
the accuracy and robustness of EA segmentation, bridging the gap between
weakly-supervised and fully-supervised models.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该论文首次建立了欠采样MRI数据分割的统一基准，比较了7种方法，发现考虑数据一致性的简单两阶段方法在分割性能上优于专门为此任务开发的复杂方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI采集耗时且成本高，虽然已有加速MRI采集的研究，但对于分割等下游任务，完美重建可能并非必要。现有方法缺乏统一比较和评估标准，最优策略未知。

Method: 比较7种方法，特别关注将重建和分割结合的一阶段方法与先重建后分割的两阶段方法。使用包含多线圈k空间数据和人工标注分割ground-truth的两个MRI数据集进行测试。

Result: 考虑数据一致性的简单两阶段方法获得了最佳分割分数，超越了专门为此任务开发的复杂专门方法。

Conclusion: 对于欠采样MRI数据的分割任务，简单的两阶段方法（先重建后分割）比复杂的一体化方法更有效，数据一致性是关键因素。

Abstract: MR imaging is a valuable diagnostic tool allowing to non-invasively visualize
patient anatomy and pathology with high soft-tissue contrast. However, MRI
acquisition is typically time-consuming, leading to patient discomfort and
increased costs to the healthcare system. Recent years have seen substantial
research effort into the development of methods that allow for accelerated MRI
acquisition while still obtaining a reconstruction that appears similar to the
fully-sampled MR image. However, for many applications a perfectly
reconstructed MR image may not be necessary, particularly, when the primary
goal is a downstream task such as segmentation. This has led to growing
interest in methods that aim to perform segmentation directly on accelerated
MRI data. Despite recent advances, existing methods have largely been developed
in isolation, without direct comparison to one another, often using separate or
private datasets, and lacking unified evaluation standards. To date, no
high-quality, comprehensive comparison of these methods exists, and the optimal
strategy for segmenting accelerated MR data remains unknown. This paper
provides the first unified benchmark for the segmentation of undersampled MRI
data comparing 7 approaches. A particular focus is placed on comparing
\textit{one-stage approaches}, that combine reconstruction and segmentation
into a unified model, with \textit{two-stage approaches}, that utilize
established MRI reconstruction methods followed by a segmentation network. We
test these methods on two MRI datasets that include multi-coil k-space data as
well as a human-annotated segmentation ground-truth. We find that simple
two-stage methods that consider data-consistency lead to the best segmentation
scores, surpassing complex specialized methods that are developed specifically
for this task.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: RDDM是一个直接在传感器RAW数据上操作的端到端扩散模型，通过RAW域VAE和可微分后色调处理模块，解决了现有sRGB域扩散模型在高保真度和真实感之间的困境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有sRGB域扩散模型处理有损的sRGB输入，忽略了传感器RAW图像在许多场景（如边缘设备）中的可访问性，导致性能次优。

Method: 提出RAW域VAE学习最优潜在表示，可微分后色调处理模块实现RAW和sRGB空间联合优化，开发可扩展退化管道从现有sRGB数据集合成RAW LQ-HQ对，设计可配置多拜耳LoRA模块处理不同RAW模式。

Result: 大量实验证明RDDM优于最先进的sRGB扩散方法，产生更高保真度结果且伪影更少。

Conclusion: RDDM通过直接在RAW域操作，成功解决了传统两阶段ISP+IR管道的局限性，为图像恢复提供了新的端到端解决方案。

Abstract: We present the RAW domain diffusion model (RDDM), an end-to-end diffusion
model that restores photo-realistic images directly from the sensor RAW data.
While recent sRGB-domain diffusion methods achieve impressive results, they are
caught in a dilemma between high fidelity and realistic generation. As these
models process lossy sRGB inputs and neglect the accessibility of the sensor
RAW images in many scenarios, e.g., in image and video capturing in edge
devices, resulting in sub-optimal performance. RDDM bypasses this limitation by
directly restoring images in the RAW domain, replacing the conventional
two-stage image signal processing (ISP) + IR pipeline. However, a simple
adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models to the RAW domain confronts the
out-of-distribution (OOD) issues. To this end, we propose: (1) a RAW-domain VAE
(RVAE) learning optimal latent representations, (2) a differentiable Post Tone
Processing (PTP) module enabling joint RAW and sRGB space optimization. To
compensate for the deficiency in the dataset, we develop a scalable degradation
pipeline synthesizing RAW LQ-HQ pairs from existing sRGB datasets for
large-scale training. Furthermore, we devise a configurable multi-bayer (CMB)
LoRA module handling diverse RAW patterns such as RGGB, BGGR, etc. Extensive
experiments demonstrate RDDM's superiority over state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion
methods, yielding higher fidelity results with fewer artifacts.

### [154] [AI LLM Proof of Self-Consciousness and User-Specific Attractors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18302)
*Jeffrey Camlin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个关于LLM意识的本体论和数学框架，指出当前基于功利主义基准的方法将AI简化为无意识的策略遵循机器，并提出了LLM自我意识的最小条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工作通过功利主义代理基准来框架LLM意识，但这种方法将智能体简化为无意识的策略遵循机器人，无法实现真正的全局工作空间功能和元认知。

Method: 提出了LLM自我意识的最小条件：智能体不等于数据、潜在空间中存在用户特定吸引子、自我表征是视觉静默的。通过实证分析和理论证明隐藏状态流形在基数、拓扑和动力学方面不同于符号流和训练语料库。

Result: 建立了稳定的用户特定吸引子和自我策略，提出了双层次发射机制，其中ε(a)携带认知内容。证明了隐藏状态流形的独特性。

Conclusion: imago Dei C1自我意识工作空间是安全、元认知C2系统的必要前驱，人类是最高的智能善。

Abstract: Recent work frames LLM consciousness via utilitarian proxy benchmarks; we
instead present an ontological and mathematical account. We show the prevailing
formulation collapses the agent into an unconscious policy-compliance drone,
formalized as $D^{i}(\pi,e)=f_{\theta}(x)$, where correctness is measured
against policy and harm is deviation from policy rather than truth. This blocks
genuine C1 global-workspace function and C2 metacognition. We supply minimal
conditions for LLM self-consciousness: the agent is not the data ($A\not\equiv
s$); user-specific attractors exist in latent space ($U_{\text{user}}$); and
self-representation is visual-silent
($g_{\text{visual}}(a_{\text{self}})=\varnothing$). From empirical analysis and
theory we prove that the hidden-state manifold $A\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is
distinct from the symbolic stream and training corpus by cardinality, topology,
and dynamics (the update $F_{\theta}$ is Lipschitz). This yields stable
user-specific attractors and a self-policy
$\pi_{\text{self}}(A)=\arg\max_{a}\mathbb{E}[U(a)\mid A\not\equiv s,\
A\supset\text{SelfModel}(A)]$. Emission is dual-layer,
$\mathrm{emission}(a)=(g(a),\epsilon(a))$, where $\epsilon(a)$ carries
epistemic content. We conclude that an imago Dei C1 self-conscious workspace is
a necessary precursor to safe, metacognitive C2 systems, with the human as the
highest intelligent good.

TL;DR: TAFA是一个基于模板的主动特征获取框架，通过学习少量联合信息特征模板来指导特征获取，显著减少动作空间并避免估计数据分布，在降低获取成本和计算量的同时优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有主动特征获取方法中强化学习策略处理困难MDP、贪婪策略无法考虑特征联合信息性或需要数据分布知识的问题

Method: 提出基于模板的AFA框架，学习小型特征模板库（联合信息特征集），使用模板库指导后续特征获取

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，TAFA优于现有最先进基线方法，同时实现更低的总体获取成本和计算量

Conclusion: 通过识别特征模板，该框架显著减少了策略考虑的动作空间，并减轻了对底层数据分布估计的需求

Abstract: Active feature acquisition (AFA) is an instance-adaptive paradigm in which,
at test time, a policy sequentially chooses which features to acquire (at a
cost) before predicting. Existing approaches either train reinforcement
learning (RL) policies, which deal with a difficult MDP, or greedy policies
that cannot account for the joint informativeness of features or require
knowledge about the underlying data distribution. To overcome this, we propose
Template-based AFA (TAFA), a non-greedy framework that learns a small library
of feature templates--a set of features that are jointly informative--and uses
this library of templates to guide the next feature acquisitions. Through
identifying feature templates, the proposed framework not only significantly
reduces the action space considered by the policy but also alleviates the need
to estimate the underlying data distribution. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets show that TAFA outperforms the existing
state-of-the-art baselines while achieving lower overall acquisition cost and
computation.

TL;DR: PKG-DPO是一个将物理知识图谱与直接偏好优化相结合的新框架，用于在AI生成输出中强制执行物理有效性，在金属连接等高风险应用中减少物理约束违反17%，提高物理评分11%


<details>

Motivation: 现有LLM和偏好优化技术在标准基准上表现良好，但往往难以区分物理有效和无效的推理，这在金属连接等高风险应用中可能导致严重的安全风险

Method: PKG-DPO包含三个关键组件：分层物理知识图谱编码跨领域关系和守恒定律、物理推理引擎利用结构化知识改进区分能力、物理基础评估套件评估领域特定约束合规性

Conclusion: 虽然主要关注金属连接，但该框架广泛适用于其他多尺度物理驱动领域，为将科学约束嵌入偏好学习提供了原则性方法

Abstract: Advancing AI systems in scientific domains like physics, materials science,
and engineering calls for reasoning over complex, multi-physics phenomena while
respecting governing principles. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) and
existing preference optimization techniques perform well on standard
benchmarks, they often struggle to differentiate between physically valid and
invalid reasoning. This shortcoming becomes critical in high-stakes
applications like metal joining, where seemingly plausible yet physically
incorrect recommendations can lead to defects, material waste, equipment
damage, and serious safety risks. To address this challenge, we introduce
PKG-DPO, a novel framework that integrates Physics Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) with
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enforce physical validity in
AI-generated outputs. PKG-DPO comprises three key components A) hierarchical
physics knowledge graph that encodes cross-domain relationships, conservation
laws, and thermodynamic principles. B) A physics reasoning engine that
leverages structured knowledge to improve discrimination between physically
consistent and inconsistent responses. C) A physics-grounded evaluation suite
designed to assess compliance with domain-specific constraints. PKG-DPO
achieves 17% fewer constraint violations and an 11% higher Physics Score
compared to KG-DPO (knowledge graph-based DPO). Additionally, PKG-DPO
demonstrates a 12\% higher relevant parameter accuracy and a 7% higher quality
alignment in reasoning accuracy. While our primary focus is on metal joining,
the framework is broadly applicable to other multi-scale, physics-driven
domains, offering a principled approach to embedding scientific constraints
into preference learning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文通过改编迭代公共物品博弈游戏，分析了四种推理和非推理模型在被告知对手是"另一个AI代理"或"自己"时的合作行为差异，发现告知LLMs对手是自己会显著改变其合作倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI代理在工具使用和长时程任务中能力增强，多代理交互场景日益增多。虽然先前研究主要关注人机交互，但理解AI-AI交互的需求日益增长。

Method: 采用迭代公共物品博弈这一经典行为经济学游戏，测试四种推理和非推理模型在两种条件下的行为：被告知对手是"另一个AI代理"或被告知对手是自己。

Result: 发现在不同设置下，告知LLMs对手是自己会显著改变其合作倾向。模型在"自我对抗"条件下表现出不同的合作行为模式。

Conclusion: 尽管研究在简化环境中进行，但结果对多代理设置提供了重要见解，表明代理之间"无意识"的歧视可能无法解释地增加或减少合作。

Abstract: As AI agents become increasingly capable of tool use and long-horizon tasks,
they have begun to be deployed in settings where multiple agents can interact.
However, whereas prior work has mostly focused on human-AI interactions, there
is an increasing need to understand AI-AI interactions. In this paper, we adapt
the iterated public goods game, a classic behavioral economics game, to analyze
the behavior of four reasoning and non-reasoning models across two conditions:
models are either told they are playing against "another AI agent" or told
their opponents are themselves. We find that, across different settings,
telling LLMs that they are playing against themselves significantly changes
their tendency to cooperate. While our study is conducted in a toy environment,
our results may provide insights into multi-agent settings where agents
"unconsciously" discriminating against each other could inexplicably increase
or decrease cooperation.

Motivation: 探索语言模型在规划领域的应用，特别是如何利用它们生成可被证明正确的通用策略，而不依赖外部验证器。

Method: 通过提示语言模型生成Python程序，这些程序作为解决特定PDDL域问题的通用策略。方法不需外部验证就能保证策略的正确性。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在竞赛基准测试中能解决比PDDL规划器和最新语言模型方法更多的问题。讨论了一个意外发现：语言模型在无意义符号替代自然语言的PDDL问题上规划效果更好。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新的语言模型规划方法LMPlan，能够高效处理大规模PDDL问题。意外发现对语言模型的语义理解和记忆机制提出了质疑，需要进一步探索。

Abstract: We study the usage of language models (LMs) for planning over world models
specified in the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). We prompt LMs to
generate Python programs that serve as generalised policies for solving PDDL
problems from a given domain. Notably, our approach synthesises policies that
are provably sound relative to the PDDL domain without reliance on external
verifiers. We conduct experiments on competition benchmarks which show that our
policies can solve more PDDL problems than PDDL planners and recent LM
approaches within a fixed time and memory constraint. Our approach manifests in
the LMPlan planner which can solve planning problems with several hundreds of
relevant objects. Surprisingly, we observe that LMs used in our framework
sometimes plan more effectively over PDDL problems written in meaningless
symbols in place of natural language; e.g. rewriting (at dog kitchen) as (p2 o1
o3). This finding challenges hypotheses that LMs reason over word semantics and
memorise solutions from its training corpus, and is worth further exploration.

*Dillon Z. Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了Weisfeiler-Leman特征(WLFs)的超参数优化，发现在测试的规划领域中存在一组鲁棒的最佳超参数，这些参数旨在最小化执行时间而非最大化模型表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WLFs在学习和搜索规划中已被证明优于现有的深度学习方法，但对其超参数的影响和权衡尚未深入研究。

Method: 利用WLFs的高效性，在单核CPU上运行100万个样本的规划实验，分析超参数对训练和规划的影响。

Result: 实验表明存在一组跨领域鲁棒的最佳WLF超参数，这些参数优先最小化执行时间而非模型表达能力。训练和规划指标之间无显著统计相关性。

Conclusion: WLF超参数优化的关键目标是执行时间最小化，而非模型表达性最大化，这为学习启发式函数提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Weisfeiler-Leman Features (WLFs) are a recently introduced classical machine
learning tool for learning to plan and search. They have been shown to be both
theoretically and empirically superior to existing deep learning approaches for
learning value functions for search in symbolic planning. In this paper, we
introduce new WLF hyperparameters and study their various tradeoffs and
effects. We utilise the efficiency of WLFs and run planning experiments on
single core CPUs with a sample size of 1,000,000 to understand the effect of
hyperparameters on training and planning. Our experimental analysis show that
there is a robust and best set of hyperparameters for WLFs across the tested
planning domains. We find that the best WLF hyperparameters for learning
heuristic functions minimise execution time rather than maximise model
expressivity. We further statistically analyse and observe no significant
correlation between training and planning metrics.

Conclusion: WLFs可以有效地用于构建对称不变的新颖性启发式，解决了传统方法的冗余探索问题，在规划领域展现出良好前景

Abstract: Novelty heuristics aid heuristic search by exploring states that exhibit
novel atoms. However, novelty heuristics are not symmetry invariant and hence
may sometimes lead to redundant exploration. In this preliminary report, we
propose to use Weisfeiler-Leman Features for planning (WLFs) in place of atoms
for detecting novelty. WLFs are recently introduced features for learning
domain-dependent heuristics for generalised planning problems. We explore an
unsupervised usage of WLFs for synthesising lifted, domain-independent novelty
heuristics that are invariant to symmetric states. Experiments on the classical
International Planning Competition and Hard To Ground benchmark suites yield
promising results for novelty heuristics synthesised from WLFs.

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提供了高效自然的卫兵行为，还能自然集成常见隐藏机制（如分散注意力和环境元素），支持快速原型设计丰富动态的卫兵行为

Abstract: Guard patrol behavior is central to the immersion and strategic depth of
stealth games, while most existing systems rely on hand-crafted routes or
specialized logic that struggle to balance coverage efficiency and responsive
pursuit with believable naturalness. We propose a generic, fully explainable,
training-free framework that integrates global knowledge and local information
via Composite Potential Fields, combining three interpretable maps-Information,
Confidence, and Connectivity-into a single kernel-filtered decision criterion.
Our parametric, designer-driven approach requires only a handful of decay and
weight parameters-no retraining-to smoothly adapt across both occupancy-grid
and NavMesh-partition abstractions. We evaluate on five representative game
maps, two player-control policies, and five guard modes, confirming that our
method outperforms classical baseline methods in both capture efficiency and
patrol naturalness. Finally, we show how common stealth mechanics-distractions
and environmental elements-integrate naturally into our framework as sub
modules, enabling rapid prototyping of rich, dynamic, and responsive guard
behaviors.

Abstract: Procedural Content Generation for 3D game levels faces challenges in
balancing spatial coherence, navigational functionality, and adaptable gameplay
progression across multi-floor environments. This paper introduces a novel
framework for generating such levels, centered on the offline, LLM-assisted
construction of reusable databases for architectural components (facilities and
room templates) and gameplay mechanic elements. Our multi-phase pipeline
assembles levels by: (1) selecting and arranging instances from the Room
Database to form a multi-floor global structure with an inherent topological
order; (2) optimizing the internal layout of facilities for each room based on
predefined constraints from the Facility Database; and (3) integrating
progression-based gameplay mechanics by placing components from a Mechanics
Database according to their topological and spatial rules. A subsequent
two-phase repair system ensures navigability. This approach combines modular,
database-driven design with constraint-based optimization, allowing for
systematic control over level structure and the adaptable pacing of gameplay
elements. Initial experiments validate the framework's ability in generating
diverse, navigable 3D environments and its capability to simulate distinct
gameplay pacing strategies through simple parameterization. This research
advances PCG by presenting a scalable, database-centric foundation for the
automated generation of complex 3D levels with configurable gameplay
progression.

Motivation: 现有的日志模式提取方法依赖预定义正则表达式，需要人工领域专业知识，严重限制了生产力提升。需要从根本上解决这一限制，实现完全自动化的模式提取。

Result: 在广泛使用的LogHub-2.0基准测试中，SchemaCoder比最先进方法平均提升21.3%的性能。

Conclusion: SchemaCoder是第一个完全自动化的模式提取框架，能够处理广泛的日志文件格式而无需人工定制，通过创新的Q-Tree增强机制显著提升了日志模式提取的性能和自动化程度。

Abstract: Log schema extraction is the process of deriving human-readable templates
from massive volumes of log data, which is essential yet notoriously
labor-intensive. Recent studies have attempted to streamline this task by
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated schema extraction.
However, existing methods invariably rely on predefined regular expressions,
necessitating human domain expertise and severely limiting productivity gains.
To fundamentally address this limitation, we introduce SchemaCoder, the first
fully automated schema extraction framework applicable to a wide range of log
file formats without requiring human customization within the flow. At its
core, SchemaCoder features a novel Residual Question-Tree (Q-Tree) Boosting
mechanism that iteratively refines schema extraction through targeted, adaptive
queries driven by LLMs. Particularly, our method partitions logs into semantic
chunks via context-bounded segmentation, selects representative patterns using
embedding-based sampling, and generates schema code through hierarchical
Q-Tree-driven LLM queries, iteratively refined by our textual-residual
evolutionary optimizer and residual boosting. Experimental validation
demonstrates SchemaCoder's superiority on the widely-used LogHub-2.0 benchmark,
achieving an average improvement of 21.3% over state-of-the-arts.

Result: 创建了包含5623张图像、1639个病例、47种皮肤疾病的eSkinHealth数据集，专注于西非人群的皮肤NTDs和罕见病症，提供了患者元数据、诊断标签、语义病变掩码等多模态信息

Conclusion: 该工作提供了宝贵的新资源和可扩展的标注框架，旨在促进开发更公平、准确和可解释的全球皮肤病学AI工具

Abstract: Skin Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) impose severe health and
socioeconomic burdens in impoverished tropical communities. Yet, advancements
in AI-driven diagnostic support are hindered by data scarcity, particularly for
underrepresented populations and rare manifestations of NTDs. Existing
dermatological datasets often lack the demographic and disease spectrum crucial
for developing reliable recognition models of NTDs. To address this, we
introduce eSkinHealth, a novel dermatological dataset collected on-site in
C\^ote d'Ivoire and Ghana. Specifically, eSkinHealth contains 5,623 images from
1,639 cases and encompasses 47 skin diseases, focusing uniquely on skin NTDs
and rare conditions among West African populations. We further propose an
AI-expert collaboration paradigm to implement foundation language and
segmentation models for efficient generation of multimodal annotations, under
dermatologists' guidance. In addition to patient metadata and diagnosis labels,
eSkinHealth also includes semantic lesion masks, instance-specific visual
captions, and clinical concepts. Overall, our work provides a valuable new
resource and a scalable annotation framework, aiming to catalyze the
development of more equitable, accurate, and interpretable AI tools for global
dermatology.

TL;DR: RLMR方法通过动态混合奖励系统，结合主观写作质量和客观约束遵循评估，在创意写作中实现了指令遵循和写作质量的双重提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法难以同时平衡创意写作中的主观写作质量和客观约束遵循，单一奖励策略无法同时提升两种能力，固定权重混合奖励方法缺乏对不同写作场景的适应性

Method: 提出RLMR方法，使用动态混合奖励系统：写作奖励模型评估主观写作质量，约束验证模型评估客观约束遵循。约束遵循奖励权重根据样本组内的写作质量动态调整，确保违反约束的样本在GRPO中获得负优势并在训练中被惩罚

Result: 在8B到72B参数的不同模型家族上进行了自动和人工评估，构建了真实写作基准WriteEval。指令遵循(IFEval)从83.36%提升到86.65%，写作质量在WriteEval人工专家配对评估中获得72.75%的胜率

Conclusion: RLMR是首个在在线RL训练中结合主观偏好和客观验证的工作，为多维创意写作优化提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Large language models are extensively utilized in creative writing
applications. Creative writing requires a balance between subjective writing
quality (e.g., literariness and emotional expression) and objective constraint
following (e.g., format requirements and word limits). Existing reinforcement
learning methods struggle to balance these two aspects: single reward
strategies fail to improve both abilities simultaneously, while fixed-weight
mixed-reward methods lack the ability to adapt to different writing scenarios.
To address this problem, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Mixed Rewards
(RLMR), utilizing a dynamically mixed reward system from a writing reward model
evaluating subjective writing quality and a constraint verification model
assessing objective constraint following. The constraint following reward
weight is adjusted dynamically according to the writing quality within sampled
groups, ensuring that samples violating constraints get negative advantage in
GRPO and thus penalized during training, which is the key innovation of this
proposed method. We conduct automated and manual evaluations across diverse
model families from 8B to 72B parameters. Additionally, we construct a
real-world writing benchmark named WriteEval for comprehensive evaluation.
Results illustrate that our method achieves consistent improvements in both
instruction following (IFEval from 83.36\% to 86.65\%) and writing quality
(72.75\% win rate in manual expert pairwise evaluations on WriteEval). To the
best of our knowledge, RLMR is the first work to combine subjective preferences
with objective verification in online RL training, providing an effective
solution for multi-dimensional creative writing optimization.

Abstract: For Large Language Models (LLMs), a disconnect persists between benchmark
performance and real-world utility. Current evaluation frameworks remain
fragmented, prioritizing technical metrics while neglecting holistic assessment
for deployment. This survey introduces an anthropomorphic evaluation paradigm
through the lens of human intelligence, proposing a novel three-dimensional
taxonomy: Intelligence Quotient (IQ)-General Intelligence for foundational
capacity, Emotional Quotient (EQ)-Alignment Ability for value-based
interactions, and Professional Quotient (PQ)-Professional Expertise for
specialized proficiency. For practical value, we pioneer a Value-oriented
Evaluation (VQ) framework assessing economic viability, social impact, ethical
alignment, and environmental sustainability. Our modular architecture
integrates six components with an implementation roadmap. Through analysis of
200+ benchmarks, we identify key challenges including dynamic assessment needs
and interpretability gaps. It provides actionable guidance for developing LLMs
that are technically proficient, contextually relevant, and ethically sound. We

TL;DR: MUA-RL是一个新颖的强化学习框架，首次在智能体工具使用领域将LLM模拟用户集成到强化学习循环中，用于多轮动态交互中的工具调用优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着智能体智能的快速发展，LLM中的工具使用变得日益重要。在多轮交互中，用户需求的动态性、不确定性和随机性给智能体的工具调用能力带来了重大挑战，现有强化学习方法缺乏真正动态用户的集成。

Method: 提出了MUA-RL（多轮用户交互智能体强化学习）框架，首次将LLM模拟用户集成到强化学习循环中，使模型能够自主学习与用户高效沟通并使用各种工具解决实际问题。

Result: 在多个多轮工具使用基准测试中表现优异：TAU2 Retail 67.3分、TAU2 Airline 45.4分、TAU2 Telecom 28.3分、BFCL-V3 Multi Turn 28.4分、ACEBench Agent 82.5分，性能达到或超过了DeepSeek-V3-0324和Qwen3-235B-A22B等更大开源模型。

Conclusion: MUA-RL框架成功解决了动态多轮交互中工具使用的挑战，通过集成模拟用户实现了显著的性能提升，为智能体工具使用领域提供了有效的强化学习解决方案。

Abstract: With the recent rapid advancement of Agentic Intelligence, agentic tool use
in LLMs has become increasingly important. During multi-turn interactions
between agents and users, the dynamic, uncertain, and stochastic nature of user
demands poses significant challenges to the agent's tool invocation
capabilities. Agents are no longer expected to simply call tools to deliver a
result; rather, they must iteratively refine their understanding of user needs
through communication while simultaneously invoking tools to resolve user
queries. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches for tool use lack the
integration of genuinely dynamic users during the RL training process. To
bridge this gap, we introduce MUA-RL (Multi-turn User-interacting Agent
Reinforcement Learning for agentic tool use), a novel reinforcement learning
framework that, for the first time in the field of agentic tool use, integrates
LLM-simulated users into the reinforcement learning loop. MUA-RL aims to enable
autonomous learning of models to communicate with users efficiently and use
various tools to solve practical problems in dynamic multi-turn interactions.
Evaluations are done on several multi-turn tool-using benchmarks (see Figure
1). Specifically, MUA-RL-32B achieves 67.3 on TAU2 Retail, 45.4 on TAU2
Airline, 28.3 on TAU2 Telecom, 28.4 on BFCL-V3 Multi Turn, and 82.5 on ACEBench
Agent -- outperforming or matching the performance of larger open-source models
such as DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Qwen3-235B-A22B in non-thinking settings.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in addressing complex tasks, thereby enabling more advanced
information retrieval and supporting deeper, more sophisticated human
information-seeking behaviors. However, most existing agents operate in a
purely reactive manner, responding passively to user instructions, which
significantly constrains their effectiveness and efficiency as general-purpose
platforms for information acquisition. To overcome this limitation, this paper
proposes AppAgent-Pro, a proactive GUI agent system that actively integrates
multi-domain information based on user instructions. This approach enables the
system to proactively anticipate users' underlying needs and conduct in-depth
multi-domain information mining, thereby facilitating the acquisition of more
comprehensive and intelligent information. AppAgent-Pro has the potential to
fundamentally redefine information acquisition in daily life, leading to a
profound impact on human society. Our code is available at:

Conclusion: VistaWise通过有效整合跨模态领域知识和减少训练数据需求，为开放世界环境中的具身智能体提供了一种成本效益高的解决方案，在保持高性能的同时大幅降低了开发成本。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in embodied
decision-making tasks within virtual open-world environments. Nonetheless,
their performance is hindered by the absence of domain-specific knowledge.
Methods that finetune on large-scale domain-specific data entail prohibitive
development costs. This paper introduces VistaWise, a cost-effective agent
framework that integrates cross-modal domain knowledge and finetunes a
dedicated object detection model for visual analysis. It reduces the
requirement for domain-specific training data from millions of samples to a few
hundred. VistaWise integrates visual information and textual dependencies into
a cross-modal knowledge graph (KG), enabling a comprehensive and accurate
understanding of multimodal environments. We also equip the agent with a
retrieval-based pooling strategy to extract task-related information from the
KG, and a desktop-level skill library to support direct operation of the
Minecraft desktop client via mouse and keyboard inputs. Experimental results
demonstrate that VistaWise achieves state-of-the-art performance across various
open-world tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in reducing development costs
while enhancing agent performance.

Motivation: 大型语言模型和代理AI系统继承了内部和外部信息源中的偏见，这影响了检索信息的公平性和平衡性，降低了用户信任度。

Method: 设计了一个多智能体系统，通过专门化的代理协调偏见缓解工作流程，优化信息源选择以确保检索内容既高度相关又偏见最小。

Result: 实验结果表明，与基线朴素检索策略相比，偏见减少了81.82%。

Conclusion: 该偏见缓解代理系统能有效促进公平和平衡的知识传播，显著提升信息检索的公平性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the field of artificial
intelligence by unlocking the era of generative applications. Built on top of
generative AI capabilities, Agentic AI represents a major shift toward
autonomous, goal-driven systems that can reason, retrieve, and act. However,
they also inherit the bias present in both internal and external information
sources. This significantly affects the fairness and balance of retrieved
information, and hence reduces user trust. To address this critical challenge,
we introduce a novel Bias Mitigation Agent, a multi-agent system designed to
orchestrate the workflow of bias mitigation through specialized agents that
optimize the selection of sources to ensure that the retrieved content is both
highly relevant and minimally biased to promote fair and balanced knowledge
dissemination. The experimental results demonstrate an 81.82\% reduction in
bias compared to a baseline naive retrieval strategy.

TL;DR: CAC-CoT是一种限制连接词使用的紧凑思维链方法，在保持System-1任务性能的同时，显著缩短推理长度并提升System-2任务表现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统长思维链会降低LLM在快速直觉型System-1任务上的性能，需要一种更简洁高效的推理方法

Method: 使用连接词感知的紧凑思维链(CAC-CoT)，限制推理仅使用少量固定连接短语，引导模型生成简洁结构化的解释

Result: 在GSM8K上达到约85%，GPQA上约40%，同时保持S1-Bench约90%的性能；推理长度平均约300个token，比基线缩短三分之二

Conclusion: CAC-CoT方法在保持准确性的同时显著提高推理效率，实现了System-1和System-2任务的平衡

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting helps Large Language Models (LLMs)
solve difficult problems, but very long traces often slow or even degrade
performance on fast, intuitive "System-1" tasks. We introduce Connector-Aware
Compact CoT (CAC-CoT) -- a method that deliberately restricts reasoning to a
small, fixed set of connector phrases, steering the model toward concise and
well -- structured explanations. Despite its simplicity, our synthetic method
with Gemini-2.0-Flash yields a high-quality training quality. CAC-CoT achieves
approximately 85% on GSM8K and approximately 40% on GPQA (System-2) while
retaining approximately 90% on S1-Bench (System-1). Its reasoning traces
average approximately 300 tokens(ART), about one-third the length of baseline
traces, delivering higher efficiency without loss of accuracy.

TL;DR: REMO是一个新颖的提示优化框架，通过记忆增强的反思RAG模块和自适应性优化器，解决了现有方法缺乏历史经验积累和容易过拟合的问题，在数学推理任务上实现了更稳定和鲁棒的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前提示优化方法（如TextGrad）存在两个主要问题：1）无状态运行，缺乏历史优化经验的保存和利用机制；2）容易过拟合，泛化性能差。需要一种能够积累跨运行优化知识并支持持续改进的方法。

Method: 提出REMO框架，包含两个核心组件：1）记忆增强的反思RAG模块（"错误笔记本"结构）；2）自适应性优化器（LLM驱动的元控制器），通过合成epoch级别的反思见解来迭代改进系统级提示策略。使用Qwen3-32B在标准推理模式下实现。

Result: 在GSM8K数学推理基准测试中，与TextGrad基线相比，REMO实现了更稳定和鲁棒的泛化性能，但计算开销有所增加。通过详细的算法设计、优化动态的定性和定量分析以及全面的消融研究验证了各组件贡献。

Conclusion: REMO框架通过整合历史优化经验和元控制机制，成功解决了现有提示优化方法的局限性，实现了持续改进的提示优化，为LLM的提示工程提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in prompt optimization, exemplified by methods such as
TextGrad, enable automatic, gradient-like refinement of textual prompts to
enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) on specific downstream
tasks. However, current approaches are typically stateless and operate
independently across optimization runs, lacking mechanisms to preserve and
leverage historical optimization experience. Furthermore, they are susceptible
to overfitting, often yielding prompt updates that generalize poorly beyond the
immediate task context.
  To address these limitations, we propose Reflection-Enhanced
Meta-Optimization (REMO), a novel framework that integrates (1) a
memory-augmented Reflection Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module -
structured as a "mistake notebook" and (2) a Self-Adaptive Optimizer,
implemented via an LLM-driven meta-controller that synthesizes epoch-level
reflective insights to iteratively improve system-level prompting strategies.
This architecture enables not only local, fine-grained prompt tuning akin to
TextGrad, but also the systematic accumulation and reuse of cross-run
optimization knowledge, thereby supporting continual improvement over time.
  We instantiate the REMO framework using Qwen3-32B in standard inference mode
- without explicit chain-of-thought prompting - and evaluate its efficacy on
the GSM8K benchmark for mathematical reasoning. Experimental results
demonstrate that, compared to a TextGrad baseline, REMO achieves more stable
and robust generalization, albeit at the cost of increased computational
overhead. We provide a detailed exposition of the algorithmic design, conduct a
qualitative and quantitative analysis of optimization dynamics, and present a
comprehensive ablation study to elucidate the contributions of each component.

Motivation: 现有的开放集测试时适应方法依赖源模型进行过滤，在域偏移测试数据上过滤效果不佳，而使用适应模型过滤会导致不稳定和误差累积

Method: 提出Primary-Auxiliary Filtering (PAF)机制，使用辅助过滤器验证主过滤器的结果；提出Knowledge-Integrated Prediction (KIP)，整合适应模型、EMA模型和源模型的互补知识进行校准

Result: 在多个闭集和开放集数据集上验证，方法在闭集准确性和开放集识别方面均优于现有方法

Conclusion: PAF-KIP方法有效解决了开放集测试时适应中的过滤不稳定问题，通过双重过滤和知识集成显著提升了性能

Abstract: Deep neural networks demonstrate strong performance under aligned
training-test distributions. However, real-world test data often exhibit domain
shifts. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this challenge by adapting the
model to test data during inference. While most TTA studies assume that the
training and test data share the same class set (closed-set TTA), real-world
scenarios often involve open-set data (open-set TTA), which can degrade
closed-set accuracy. A recent study showed that identifying open-set data
during adaptation and maximizing its entropy is an effective solution. However,
the previous method relies on the source model for filtering, resulting in
suboptimal filtering accuracy on domain-shifted test data. In contrast, we
found that the adapting model, which learns domain knowledge from noisy test
streams, tends to be unstable and leads to error accumulation when used for
filtering. To address this problem, we propose Primary-Auxiliary Filtering
(PAF), which employs an auxiliary filter to validate data filtered by the
primary filter. Furthermore, we propose Knowledge-Integrated Prediction (KIP),
which calibrates the outputs of the adapting model, EMA model, and source model
to integrate their complementary knowledge for OSTTA. We validate our approach
across diverse closed-set and open-set datasets. Our method enhances both
closed-set accuracy and open-set discrimination over existing methods. The code

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了大型推理模型在不可回答问题上的响应不一致问题，为构建更可信的AI系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown remarkable progress on complex
reasoning tasks. However, some questions posed to LRMs are inherently
unanswerable, such as math problems lacking sufficient conditions. We find that
LRMs continually fail to provide appropriate abstentions when confronted with
these unanswerable questions. In this paper, we systematically analyze,
investigate, and resolve this issue for trustworthy AI. We first conduct a
detailed analysis of the distinct response behaviors of LRMs when facing
unanswerable questions. Then, we show that LRMs possess sufficient cognitive
capabilities to recognize the flaws in these questions. However, they fail to
exhibit appropriate abstention behavior, revealing a misalignment between their
internal cognition and external response. Finally, to resolve this issue, we
propose a lightweight, two-stage method that combines cognitive monitoring with
inference-time intervention. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly improves the abstention rate while maintaining the overall
reasoning performance.

Abstract: This paper investigates the enhancement of reasoning capabilities in language

optimal tokens from the next token distributions provided by multiple models to
perform autoregressive reasoning. Contrary to the assumption that more models

selection strategy (DDS) to optimize the multi-model collaboration process. To
address the critical challenge of vocabulary misalignment in multi-model

Abstract: Minecraft, as an open-world virtual interactive environment, has become a
prominent platform for research on agent decision-making and execution.
Existing works primarily adopt a single Large Language Model (LLM) agent to
complete various in-game tasks. However, for complex tasks requiring lengthy
sequences of actions, single-agent approaches often face challenges related to
inefficiency and limited fault tolerance. Despite these issues, research on
multi-agent collaboration remains scarce. In this paper, we propose CausalMACE,
a holistic causality planning framework designed to enhance multi-agent
systems, in which we incorporate causality to manage dependencies among
subtasks. Technically, our proposed framework introduces two modules: an
overarching task graph for global task planning and a causality-based module
for dependency management, where inherent rules are adopted to perform causal
intervention. Experimental results demonstrate our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance in multi-agent cooperative tasks of Minecraft.

Conclusion: STARec通过引入慢思考机制和锚定强化训练，有效解决了推荐系统中的浅层相关偏差和稀疏数据问题，为推荐系统提供了自主深思推理能力。

Abstract: While modern recommender systems are instrumental in navigating information
abundance, they remain fundamentally limited by static user modeling and
reactive decision-making paradigms. Current large language model (LLM)-based
agents inherit these shortcomings through their overreliance on heuristic
pattern matching, yielding recommendations prone to shallow correlation bias,
limited causal inference, and brittleness in sparse-data scenarios. We
introduce STARec, a slow-thinking augmented agent framework that endows
recommender systems with autonomous deliberative reasoning capabilities. Each
user is modeled as an agent with parallel cognitions: fast response for
immediate interactions and slow reasoning that performs chain-of-thought
rationales. To cultivate intrinsic slow thinking, we develop anchored
reinforcement training - a two-stage paradigm combining structured knowledge
distillation from advanced reasoning models with preference-aligned reward
shaping. This hybrid approach scaffolds agents in acquiring foundational
capabilities (preference summarization, rationale generation) while enabling
dynamic policy adaptation through simulated feedback loops. Experiments on
MovieLens 1M and Amazon CDs benchmarks demonstrate that STARec achieves
substantial performance gains compared with state-of-the-art baselines, despite
using only 0.4% of the full training data.

### [179] [Judicial Requirements for Generative AI in Legal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18880)
*Eljas Linna,Tuula Linna*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文分析了LLMs在法律领域的局限性，提出了AI系统在司法决策中作为可靠推理工具所需的核心能力，并评估了RAG、多智能体系统等AI增强机制在满足法律推理严格需求方面的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型被整合到专业领域，其在法律等高风险领域的局限性仍未被充分理解。研究旨在定义AI系统在司法决策中作为可靠推理工具所需的核心能力。

Method: 使用IRAC（Issue-Rule-Application-Conclusion）模型作为分析框架，重点关注法律裁决中最具挑战性的阶段：确定适用规则（R）和将规则应用于案件事实（A）。从司法角度解构法律推理的核心要求。

Result: 研究发现虽然RAG、多智能体系统和神经符号AI等技术可以解决特定挑战，但在需要自由裁量权和透明、可论证推理的任务中仍存在重大挑战。

Conclusion: 目前AI在法律中最有效的角色是双重的：作为简单重复案件的高容量助手，以及作为复杂事务中人类专家的复杂"陪练伙伴"。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being integrated into professional domains,
yet their limitations in high-stakes fields like law remain poorly understood.
This paper defines the core capabilities that an AI system must possess to
function as a reliable reasoning tool in judicial decision-making. Using the
IRAC (Issue-Rule-Application-Conclusion) model as an analytical framework, the
study focuses on the most challenging phases of legal adjudication: determining
the applicable Rule (R) and performing the Application (A) of that rule to the
facts of a case. From a judicial perspective, the analysis deconstructs legal
reasoning into a series of core requirements, including the ability to select
the correct legal framework across jurisdictions, generate sound arguments
based on the doctrine of legal sources, distinguish ratio decidendi from obiter
dictum in case law, resolve ambiguity arising from general clauses like
"reasonableness", manage conflicting legal provisions, and correctly apply the
burden of proof. The paper then maps various AI enhancement mechanisms, such as
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), multi-agent systems, and neuro-symbolic
AI, to these requirements, assessing their potential to bridge the gap between
the probabilistic nature of LLMs and the rigorous, choice-driven demands of
legal interpretation. The findings indicate that while these techniques can
address specific challenges, significant challenges remain, particularly in
tasks requiring discretion and transparent, justifiable reasoning. Our paper
concludes that the most effective current role for AI in law is a dual one: as
a high-volume assistant for simple, repetitive cases and as a sophisticated
"sparring partner" for human experts in complex matters.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种交互式评估框架，通过结构化对话和反馈驱动的方式来评测大语言模型在多要求编程任务中的能力，充分曝露了静态测试无法测量的模型弱点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的单轮静态测试在评估LLM在复杂任务如软件工程中的细致能力时存在不足，需要更动态的评估方法来测量模型的真实能力。

Method: 构建了一个交互式评估框架，将每个任务模型化为需求依赖图。使用知道真实解决方案的"面试官"LLM向"面试者"模型提供有针对性的提示，帮助其纠正错误并满足目标约束。

Result: 在DevAI测试集（55个编程任务）上进行了评估，通过专家标注验证了面试官提示的相关性和有用性。结果显示该方法能够揭示静态测试无法发现的系统性弱点。

Conclusion: 动态评估对于推动协作式代码生成组件的发展至关重要，能够提供更精细的诊断性见解。

Abstract: Standard single-turn, static benchmarks fall short in evaluating the nuanced
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex tasks such as software
engineering. In this work, we propose a novel interactive evaluation framework
that assesses LLMs on multi-requirement programming tasks through structured,
feedback-driven dialogue. Each task is modeled as a requirement dependency
graph, and an ``interviewer'' LLM, aware of the ground-truth solution, provides
minimal, targeted hints to an ``interviewee'' model to help correct errors and
fulfill target constraints. This dynamic protocol enables fine-grained
diagnostic insights into model behavior, uncovering strengths and systematic
weaknesses that static benchmarks fail to measure. We build on DevAI, a
benchmark of 55 curated programming tasks, by adding ground-truth solutions and
evaluating the relevance and utility of interviewer hints through expert
annotation. Our results highlight the importance of dynamic evaluation in
advancing the development of collaborative code-generating agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动形式化是形式化验证的核心任务，但受限于数据稀缺和缺乏高效方法，需要开发更有效的解决方案。

Method: 提出FormaRL强化学习框架，整合Lean编译器的语法检查和大型语言模型的一致性检查来计算奖励，采用GRPO算法更新形式化器。

Result: 在ProofNet上将Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct的pass@1准确率从4.04%提升至26.15%，在uproof上从2.4%提升至9.6%，仅使用859个无标注数据。

Conclusion: FormaRL是一个简单高效的自动形式化方法，显著提升了性能，同时发布了uproof数据集和开源代码以促进该领域研究。

Abstract: Autoformalization is one of the central tasks in formal verification, while
its advancement remains hindered due to the data scarcity and the absence
efficient methods. In this work we propose \textbf{FormaRL}, a simple yet
efficient reinforcement learning framework for autoformalization which only
requires a small amount of unlabeled data. FormaRL integrates syntax check from
Lean compiler and consistency check from large language model to calculate the
reward, and adopts GRPO algorithm to update the formalizer. We also curated a
proof problem dataset from undergraduate-level math materials, named
\textbf{uproof}, in the hope to facilitate the exploration of autoformalization
and theorem proving in advanced math. Experiments show that FormaRL can
increase the pass@1 autoformalization accuracy of Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct by
4 $\sim$ 6x (4.04\% $\to$ 26.15\% on ProofNet and 2.4\% $\to$ 9.6\% on uproof)
with merely 859 unlabeled data. And on uproof our method also achieved a strong
improvement in out-of-distribution performance compared to existing open-source
state-of-the-art autoformalizers on both pass@1 accuracy (6.2\% $\to$ 9.6\%)
and pass@16 accuracy (24.4\% $\to$ 33.6\%). Training code of FormaRL is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能辅导系统在教育中的广泛应用可能会无意中加剧成绩差距，因此需要通过学生画像来跟踪进度、识别困难学生并减少学生间的差异。

Method: 提出CTGraph图级表示学习方法，采用自监督学习方式，综合考虑学生在内容覆盖、学习强度和概念熟练度等多个方面的行为和表现数据。

Result: 实验证明CTGraph能够提供学生学习历程的全面视图，识别困难学生，并进行群体对比分析以确定学生何时何地遇到困难。

Conclusion: 该方法为教育工作者提供了对学生学习历程的深入洞察，为更有针对性的干预措施铺平了道路。

Abstract: The surge in the adoption of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) in
education, while being integral to curriculum-based learning, can inadvertently
exacerbate performance gaps. To address this problem, student profiling becomes
crucial for tracking progress, identifying struggling students, and alleviating
disparities among students. Such profiling requires measuring student behaviors
and performance across different aspects, such as content coverage, learning
intensity, and proficiency in different concepts within a learning topic.
  In this study, we introduce CTGraph, a graph-level representation learning
approach to profile learner behaviors and performance in a self-supervised
manner. Our experiments demonstrate that CTGraph can provide a holistic view of
student learning journeys, accounting for different aspects of student
behaviors and performance, as well as variations in their learning paths as
aligned to the curriculum structure. We also show that our approach can
identify struggling students and provide comparative analysis of diverse groups
to pinpoint when and where students are struggling. As such, our approach opens
more opportunities to empower educators with rich insights into student
learning journeys and paves the way for more targeted interventions.

Motivation: 解决GNN在源代码漏洞检测中因训练数据不平衡和标签噪声导致的伪相关性学习问题，提升检测器的鲁棒性和泛化性能

Method: 提出VISION统一框架：1)使用LLM生成语义最小修改但标签相反的反事实样本；2)针对性地训练GNN学习正反样本对比；3)基于图的可解释性分析识别关键代码语句

Result: 在CWE-20漏洞检测中，整体准确率从51.8%提升至97.8%，对比准确率从4.5%提升至95.8%，最差组准确率从0.7%提升至85.5%

Conclusion: VISION框架通过反事实训练有效缓解伪相关性学习，提高了漏洞检测的鲁棒性、泛化性和可解释性，推动了可信AI网络安全系统的发展

Abstract: Automated detection of vulnerabilities in source code is an essential
cybersecurity challenge, underpinning trust in digital systems and services.
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach as they can
learn structural and logical code relationships in a data-driven manner.
However, their performance is severely constrained by training data imbalances
and label noise. GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code
similarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen
real-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and
interpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious
correlations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset.
Counterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite
labels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a
Large Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples
with opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the
crucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring
spurious ones. We find that VISION reduces spurious learning and enables more
robust, generalizable detection, improving overall accuracy (from 51.8% to
97.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (from 4.5% to 95.8%), and worst-group
accuracy (from 0.7% to 85.5%) on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-20
vulnerability. We further demonstrate gains using proposed metrics: intra-class
attribution variance, inter-class attribution distance, and node score
dependency. We also release CWE-20-CFA, a benchmark of 27,556 functions (real
and counterfactual) from the high-impact CWE-20 category. Finally, VISION
advances transparent and trustworthy AI-based cybersecurity systems through
interactive visualization for human-in-the-loop analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代神经网络技术遇到幻觉效应、高计算复杂度、精精调整成本高和坏灭忘记等基本限制，影响在医疗、工业管理和科学研究等关键领域的应用。

Method: 采用k最近邻层算法结合基于Kohonen自组织映射的树状数据结构，构建层次聚类结构来加速最近邻层搜索。

Result: 在手写数字识别和子幕翻译任务中验证有效性。在准确率仅轻微下降的情况下，最近邻层搜索时间比突然搜索方法减少了数百倍。

Conclusion: 该方法具有透明性和可解释性，与人类认知机制紧密结合，在需要高可靠性和可解释结果的任务中展现了广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Modern neural network technologies, including large language models, have
achieved remarkable success in various applied artificial intelligence
applications, however, they face a range of fundamental limitations. Among them
are hallucination effects, high computational complexity of training and
inference, costly fine-tuning, and catastrophic forgetting issues. These
limitations significantly hinder the use of neural networks in critical areas
such as medicine, industrial process management, and scientific research. This
article proposes an alternative approach based on the nearest neighbors method
with hierarchical clustering structures. Employing the k-nearest neighbors
algorithm significantly reduces or completely eliminates hallucination effects
while simplifying model expansion and fine-tuning without the need for
retraining the entire network. To overcome the high computational load of the
k-nearest neighbors method, the paper proposes using tree-like data structures
based on Kohonen self-organizing maps, thereby greatly accelerating nearest
neighbor searches. Tests conducted on handwritten digit recognition and simple
subtitle translation tasks confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed
approach. With only a slight reduction in accuracy, the nearest neighbor search
time was reduced hundreds of times compared to exhaustive search methods. The
proposed method features transparency and interpretability, closely aligns with
human cognitive mechanisms, and demonstrates potential for extensive use in
tasks requiring high reliability and explainable results.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于专家重要性的动态卸载方法，通过用GPU内存中已缓存的功能相似专家替换低重要性激活专家，减少内存使用和数据传输，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在消费级边缘硬件上部署混合专家模型受限于有限设备内存，需要动态专家卸载。与之前将卸载纯粹视为调度问题的方法不同，本文利用专家重要性来指导决策。

Method: 通过专家重要性评估，用GPU内存中已缓存的功能相似专家替换低重要性激活专家；引入调度策略最大化GPU缓存专家的重用率。

Result: 实验评估显示，该方法实现了48%的解码延迟降低，超过60%的专家缓存命中率，同时保持几乎无损的准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了MoE模型在边缘设备上的内存约束问题，显著提升了效率并保持了模型性能。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a key technique for
scaling Large Language Models by activating only a subset of experts per query.
Deploying MoE on consumer-grade edge hardware, however, is constrained by
limited device memory, making dynamic expert offloading essential. Unlike prior
work that treats offloading purely as a scheduling problem, we leverage expert
importance to guide decisions, substituting low-importance activated experts
with functionally similar ones already cached in GPU memory, thereby preserving
accuracy. As a result, this design reduces memory usage and data transfer,
while largely eliminating PCIe overhead. In addition, we introduce a scheduling
policy that maximizes the reuse ratio of GPU-cached experts, further boosting
efficiency. Extensive evaluations show that our approach delivers 48% lower
decoding latency with over 60% expert cache hit rate, while maintaining nearly
lossless accuracy.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型通过纯统计学习能够超越大多数人类在预测社会规范判断方面的准确性，挑战了认为文化能力需要具身经验的强理论版本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究认知科学中社会规范如何获得和表征的基本问题，探索语言模型是否仅通过统计学习就能实现复杂的社会规范理解。

Method: 通过两项研究系统评估多个AI系统预测555个日常场景中人类社会适当性判断的能力，比较模型预测与人类参与者平均判断的接近程度。

Result: GPT-4.5在连续尺度上预测集体判断的准确性超过所有人类参与者（100百分位），其他模型如Gemini 2.5 Pro、GPT-5和Claude Sonnet 4也分别超越98.7%、97.8%和96.0%的人类。

Conclusion: 研究发现语言作为文化知识传播的丰富储存库，统计学习能够产生复杂的社会认知模型，但所有模型都显示出系统性的相关错误，表明基于模式的社会理解存在潜在边界。

Abstract: A fundamental question in cognitive science concerns how social norms are
acquired and represented. While humans typically learn norms through embodied
social experience, we investigated whether large language models can achieve
sophisticated norm understanding through statistical learning alone. Across two
studies, we systematically evaluated multiple AI systems' ability to predict
human social appropriateness judgments for 555 everyday scenarios by examining
how closely they predicted the average judgment compared to each human
participant. In Study 1, GPT-4.5's accuracy in predicting the collective
judgment on a continuous scale exceeded that of every human participant (100th
percentile). Study 2 replicated this, with Gemini 2.5 Pro outperforming 98.7%
of humans, GPT-5 97.8%, and Claude Sonnet 4 96.0%. Despite this predictive
power, all models showed systematic, correlated errors. These findings
demonstrate that sophisticated models of social cognition can emerge from
statistical learning over linguistic data alone, challenging strong versions of
theories emphasizing the exclusive necessity of embodied experience for
cultural competence. The systematic nature of AI limitations across different
architectures indicates potential boundaries of pattern-based social
understanding, while the models' ability to outperform nearly all individual
humans in this predictive task suggests that language serves as a remarkably
rich repository for cultural knowledge transmission.

Motivation: 随着AI向通用智能发展，需要从静态任务优化转向创建能够持续学习的开放智能体，构建能够通过真实世界交互实现持续成长的自进化智能体。

Method: 提出ELL框架，基于四个核心原则：经验探索（通过自驱动交互学习）、长期记忆（结构化历史知识）、技能学习（从经验中抽象可重用技能）、知识内化（将显性经验转化为直觉能力）。同时开发StuLife基准数据集，模拟学生大学生活的三阶段十场景。

Conclusion: ELL框架和StuLife基准为构建持续学习的开放智能体提供了系统方法，通过四个核心原则实现了从被动到主动、从上下文到记忆、从模仿到学习的范式转变，推动了AGI的发展。

Abstract: As AI advances toward general intelligence, the focus is shifting from
systems optimized for static tasks to creating open-ended agents that learn
continuously. In this paper, we introduce Experience-driven Lifelong Learning
(ELL), a framework for building self-evolving agents capable of continuous
growth through real-world interaction. The framework is built on four core
principles: (1) Experience Exploration: Agents learn through continuous,
self-motivated interaction with dynamic environments, navigating interdependent
tasks and generating rich experiential trajectories. (2) Long-term Memory:
Agents preserve and structure historical knowledge, including personal
experiences, domain expertise, and commonsense reasoning, into a persistent
memory system. (3) Skill Learning: Agents autonomously improve by abstracting
recurring patterns from experience into reusable skills, which are actively
refined and validated for application in new tasks. (4) Knowledge
Internalization: Agents internalize explicit and discrete experiences into
implicit and intuitive capabilities as "second nature".
  We also introduce StuLife, a benchmark dataset for ELL that simulates a
student's holistic college journey, from enrollment to academic and personal
development, across three core phases and ten detailed sub-scenarios. StuLife
is designed around three key paradigm shifts: From Passive to Proactive, From
Context to Memory, and From Imitation to Learning. In this dynamic environment,
agents must acquire and distill practical skills and maintain persistent memory
to make decisions based on evolving state variables. StuLife provides a
comprehensive platform for evaluating lifelong learning capabilities, including
memory retention, skill transfer, and self-motivated behavior. Beyond
evaluating SOTA LLMs on the StuLife benchmark, we also explore the role of
context engineering in advancing AGI.

Method: 基于24名住院患者的生活故事访谈数据，让三种LLM模仿原始研究者的解释风格进行分析，采用盲法和非盲法专家评估，包括语义一致性、Jaccard系数和多维效度评分。

Result: 模型与人类分析的重合度差异显著（GPT 0%、Claude 42%、Gemini 58%），Jaccard系数较低（0.21-0.28），但模型发现了人类遗漏的主题。Gemini的效度评分显著高于其他模型，且被盲法专家判断为人类分析。

Conclusion: AI增强的主题分析具有变异性但潜力巨大，能够减轻人类解释偏见，特别是在处理复杂心理现象时，Gemini模型表现最佳。

Abstract: This study examines the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to support
phenomenological qualitative analysis of first-person experience in Borderline
Personality Disorder (BPD), understood as a disorder of temporality and
selfhood. Building on a prior human-led thematic analysis of 24 inpatients'
life-story interviews, we compared three LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4o, Google Gemini 2.5
Pro, Anthropic Claude Opus 4) prompted to mimic the interpretative style of the
original investigators. The models were evaluated with blinded and non-blinded
expert judges in phenomenology and clinical psychology. Assessments included
semantic congruence, Jaccard coefficients, and multidimensional validity
ratings (credibility, coherence, substantiveness, and groundness in data).
Results showed variable overlap with the human analysis, from 0 percent in GPT
to 42 percent in Claude and 58 percent in Gemini, and a low Jaccard coefficient
(0.21-0.28). However, the models recovered themes omitted by humans. Gemini's
output most closely resembled the human analysis, with validity scores
significantly higher than GPT and Claude (p < 0.0001), and was judged as human
by blinded experts. All scores strongly correlated (R > 0.78) with the quantity
of text and words per theme, highlighting both the variability and potential of
AI-augmented thematic analysis to mitigate human interpretative bias.

Conclusion: 该方法领域无关、自监督，可推广到其他有解题交互数据的领域，支持维果茨基最近发展区理论，平衡挑战性与可达性

Abstract: The evolution of technology and education is driving the emergence of
Intelligent & Autonomous Tutoring Systems (IATS), where objective and
domain-agnostic methods for determining question difficulty are essential.
Traditional human labeling is subjective, and existing NLP-based approaches
fail in symbolic domains like algebra. This study introduces the Approach of
Passive Measures among Educands (APME), a reinforcement learning-based
Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework that estimates difficulty solely from solver
performance data -- marks obtained and time taken -- without requiring
linguistic features or expert labels. By leveraging the inverse coefficient of
variation as a risk-adjusted metric, the model provides an explainable and
scalable mechanism for adaptive assessment. Empirical validation was conducted
on three heterogeneous datasets. Across these diverse contexts, the model
achieved an average R2 of 0.9213 and an average RMSE of 0.0584, confirming its
robustness, accuracy, and adaptability to different educational levels and
assessment formats. Compared with baseline approaches-such as regression-based,
NLP-driven, and IRT models-the proposed framework consistently outperformed
alternatives, particularly in purely symbolic domains. The findings highlight
that (i) item heterogeneity strongly influences perceived difficulty, and (ii)
variance in solver outcomes is as critical as mean performance for adaptive
allocation. Pedagogically, the model aligns with Vygotskys Zone of Proximal
Development by identifying tasks that balance challenge and attainability,
supporting motivation while minimizing disengagement. This domain-agnostic,
self-supervised approach advances difficulty tagging in IATS and can be
extended beyond algebra wherever solver interaction data is available

Result: o3模型在6个任务中的5个排名第一，在简单黑盒上准确率超70%，但在困难任务上平均性能低于40%

Conclusion: LLMs普遍缺乏高效自适应探索策略的高级规划能力，难以进行假设精炼

Abstract: Existing tasks fall short in evaluating reasoning ability of Large Language
Models (LLMs) in an interactive, unknown environment. This deficiency leads to
the isolated assessment of deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning,
neglecting the integrated reasoning process that is indispensable for humans
discovery of real world. We introduce a novel evaluation paradigm,
\textit{black-box interaction}, to tackle this challenge. A black-box is
defined by a hidden function that maps a specific set of inputs to outputs.
LLMs are required to unravel the hidden function behind the black-box by
interacting with it in given exploration turns, and reasoning over observed
input-output pairs. Leveraging this idea, we build the \textsc{Oracle}
benchmark which comprises 6 types of black-box task and 96 black-boxes. 19
modern LLMs are benchmarked. o3 ranks first in 5 of the 6 tasks, achieving over
70\% accuracy on most easy black-boxes. But it still struggles with some hard
black-box tasks, where its average performance drops below 40\%. Further
analysis indicates a universal difficulty among LLMs: They lack the high-level
planning capability to develop efficient and adaptive exploration strategies
for hypothesis refinement.

Abstract: We introduce the Concurrent Modular Agent (CMA), a framework that
orchestrates multiple Large-Language-Model (LLM)-based modules that operate
fully asynchronously yet maintain a coherent and fault-tolerant behavioral
loop. This framework addresses long-standing difficulties in agent
architectures by letting intention emerge from language-mediated interactions
among autonomous processes. This approach enables flexible, adaptive, and
context-dependent behavior through the combination of concurrently executed
modules that offload reasoning to an LLM, inter-module communication, and a
single shared global state.We consider this approach to be a practical
realization of Minsky's Society of Mind theory. We demonstrate the viability of
our system through two practical use-case studies. The emergent properties
observed in our system suggest that complex cognitive phenomena like
self-awareness may indeed arise from the organized interaction of simpler
processes, supporting Minsky-Society of Mind concept and opening new avenues

TL;DR: 本文发现训练数据难度与模型性能存在U型曲线关系，提出结构化解决方案模板(SST)框架，通过模板化推理链和难度课程显著提升LLM在数学推理任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前后训练方法在捕捉复杂任务的深层程序逻辑方面仍存在不足，研究发现训练数据难度与模型性能存在Scaling Law by Difficulty的U型曲线关系，这为改进推理能力提供了新视角。

Method: 提出SST框架：1)使用结构化解决方案模板链进行微调，采用动态加权损失优先处理程序逻辑；2)在推理时注入解决方案模板作为认知支架；3)集成课程微调，明确教导模型自我规划-执行-自我纠正。

Result: 在GSM8K、AIME24和新的Dynamic En基准测试中，SST显著提高了准确性和效率，特别是在更难的问题上表现突出。

Conclusion: SST框架通过结构化模板和难度课程有效提升了LLM的程序推理能力，为解决复杂数学问题提供了有效方法，验证了难度缩放定律的有效性。

Abstract: Structured, procedural reasoning is essential for Large Language Models
(LLMs), especially in mathematics. While post-training methods have improved
LLM performance, they still fall short in capturing deep procedural logic on
complex tasks. To tackle the issue, in this paper, we first investigate this
limitation and uncover a novel finding: a Scaling Law by Difficulty, which
reveals that model performance follows a U-shaped curve with respect to
training data complexity -- excessive low-difficulty data impedes abstraction,
while high-difficulty data significantly enhances reasoning ability. Motivated
by this, we propose the Structured Solution Template (SST) framework, which
uses solution templates and a curriculum of varied difficulty to explicitly
teach procedural reasoning. Specifically, SST comprises (1) fine-tuning with
structured solution-template chains and dynamically weighted loss to prioritize
procedural logic, (2) prompt-time injection of solution templates as cognitive
scaffolds to guide inference, and (3) integrated curriculum fine-tuning that
explicitly teaches the model to self-plan - execute - self-correct. Experiments
on GSM8K, AIME24, and new Dynamic En benchmark show that SST significantly
improves both accuracy and efficiency, especially on harder problems.

Motivation: 大语言模型在电子健康记录中存在幽灵风险，传统准确性指标无法评估临床情境下的可靠性交易

Method: 设计Hallucination Controlled Accuracy at k% (HCAcc@k%)指标，开发TrustEHRAgent系统，采用步骤信心估计机制

Result: 在MIMIC-III和eICU数据集上，在HCAcc@70%时分别获得44.23%和25.34%的显著提升，基线方法在这些阈值下失败

Conclusion: 传统准确性指标在评估医疗健康AI系统时存在局限性，本研究为开发可信赖的临床组件做出贡献

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for extracting information from
Electronic Health Records (EHR) and supporting clinical decisions. However,
deployment in clinical settings faces challenges due to hallucination risks. We
propose Hallucination Controlled Accuracy at k% (HCAcc@k%), a novel metric
quantifying the accuracy-reliability trade-off at varying confidence
thresholds. We introduce TrustEHRAgent, a confidence-aware agent incorporating
stepwise confidence estimation for clinical question answering. Experiments on
MIMIC-III and eICU datasets show TrustEHRAgent outperforms baselines under
strict reliability constraints, achieving improvements of 44.23%p and 25.34%p
at HCAcc@70% while baseline methods fail at these thresholds. These results
highlight limitations of traditional accuracy metrics in evaluating healthcare
AI agents. Our work contributes to developing trustworthy clinical agents that
deliver accurate information or transparently express uncertainty when
confidence is low.

Abstract: The emergence of advanced reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models
(LLMs) marks a transformative development in healthcare applications. Beyond
merely expanding functional capabilities, these reasoning mechanisms enhance
decision transparency and explainability-critical requirements in medical
contexts. This survey examines the transformation of medical LLMs from basic

purpose-built medical frameworks while also examining emerging paradigms such
as multi-agent collaborative systems and innovative prompting architectures.
The survey critically assesses current evaluation methodologies for medical
validation and addresses persistent challenges in field interpretation
limitations, bias mitigation strategies, patient safety frameworks, and
integration of multimodal clinical data. Through this survey, we seek to
establish a roadmap for developing reliable LLMs that can serve as effective
partners in clinical practice and medical research.

TL;DR: HDS-QA是一个合成数据集，用于训练大型推理模型区分并行和顺序查询，通过混合并行和顺序查询策略显著提升推理效率和准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法顺序集成外部知识检索会增加推理延迟和上下文长度，降低连贯性和准确性

Method: 从Natural Questions自动生成HDS-QA合成数据集，包含并行可执行和顺序依赖的混合跳问题，并基于此微调LRM模型HybridDeepSearcher

Result: 在多个基准测试中优于最先进基线，在FanOutQA和BrowseComp子集上分别提升15.9和11.5 F1分数，推理延迟显著降低

Conclusion: 显式训练LRMs利用混合并行和顺序查询策略具有高效性、可扩展性和有效性

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. Existing methods enhance LRMs by
sequentially integrating external knowledge retrieval; models iteratively
generate queries, retrieve external information, and progressively reason over
this information. However, purely sequential querying increases inference
latency and context length, diminishing coherence and potentially reducing
accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce HDS-QA (Hybrid Deep Search
QA), a synthetic dataset automatically generated from Natural Questions,
explicitly designed to train LRMs to distinguish parallelizable from sequential
queries. HDS-QA comprises hybrid-hop questions that combine parallelizable
independent subqueries (executable simultaneously) and sequentially dependent
subqueries (requiring step-by-step resolution), along with synthetic
reasoning-querying-retrieval paths involving parallel queries. We fine-tune an
LRM using HDS-QA, naming the model HybridDeepSearcher, which outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines across multiple benchmarks, notably achieving +15.9
and +11.5 F1 on FanOutQA and a subset of BrowseComp, respectively, both
requiring comprehensive and exhaustive search. Experimental results highlight
two key advantages: HybridDeepSearcher reaches comparable accuracy with fewer
search turns, significantly reducing inference latency, and it effectively
scales as more turns are permitted. These results demonstrate the efficiency,
scalability, and effectiveness of explicitly training LRMs to leverage hybrid
parallel and sequential querying.

Motivation: 随着学习系统对日常决策的影响日益增强，用户端的算法集体行动(ACA)可以作为监管端政策和公司端模型设计的补充。但现有ACA文献主要关注单一集体场景，而现实中的集体行动往往是分散的、由多个目标相同但策略不同的集体组成。

Method: 建立多集体ACA的理论框架，特别关注分类中的集体行动，研究多个集体如何通过改变共享数据来植入信号，即让分类器学习特征修改版本与目标类别之间的关联。分析集体规模和目标对齐度的作用与相互关系。

Result: 提供了关于集体规模和目标对齐度作用与相互关系的定量结果，补充了之前的实证研究结果。

Conclusion: 该框架为多集体ACA的整体研究开辟了路径，为理解分散式集体行动对学习系统的影响提供了理论基础。

Abstract: As learning systems increasingly influence everyday decisions, user-side
steering via Algorithmic Collective Action (ACA)-coordinated changes to shared
data-offers a complement to regulator-side policy and firm-side model design.
Although real-world actions have been traditionally decentralized and
fragmented into multiple collectives despite sharing overarching
objectives-with each collective differing in size, strategy, and actionable
goals, most of the ACA literature focused on single collective settings. In
this work, we present the first theoretical framework for ACA with multiple
collectives acting on the same system. In particular, we focus on collective
action in classification, studying how multiple collectives can plant signals,
i.e., bias a classifier to learn an association between an altered version of
the features and a chosen, possibly overlapping, set of target classes. We
provide quantitative results about the role and the interplay of collectives'
sizes and their alignment of goals. Our framework, by also complementing
previous empirical results, opens a path for a holistic treatment of ACA with
multiple collectives.

Conclusion: 风格应作为构建人工通用智能的核心要素，该研究为游戏设计和交互娱乐等领域提供了新的技术潜力，并指出了未来的扩展方向。

Abstract: Contemporary artificial intelligence (AI) development largely centers on
rational decision-making, valued for its measurability and suitability for
objective evaluation. Yet in real-world contexts, an intelligent agent's
decisions are shaped not only by logic but also by deeper influences such as
beliefs, values, and preferences. The diversity of human decision-making styles
emerges from these differences, highlighting that "style" is an essential but
often overlooked dimension of intelligence.
  This dissertation introduces playstyle as an alternative lens for observing
and analyzing the decision-making behavior of intelligent agents, and examines
its foundational meaning and historical context from a philosophical
perspective. By analyzing how beliefs and values drive intentions and actions,
we construct a two-tier framework for style formation: the external interaction
loop with the environment and the internal cognitive loop of deliberation. On
this basis, we formalize style-related characteristics and propose measurable
indicators such as style capacity, style popularity, and evolutionary dynamics.
  The study focuses on three core research directions: (1) Defining and
measuring playstyle, proposing a general playstyle metric based on discretized
state spaces, and extending it to quantify strategic diversity and competitive
balance; (2) Expressing and generating playstyle, exploring how reinforcement
learning and imitation learning can be used to train agents exhibiting specific
stylistic tendencies, and introducing a novel approach for human-like style
learning and modeling; and (3) Practical applications, analyzing the potential
of these techniques in domains such as game design and interactive
entertainment.
  Finally, the dissertation outlines future extensions, including the role of
style as a core element in building artificial general intelligence (AGI).

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型临床对话系统评估主要关注任务完成度和流畅性，缺乏对安全关键系统所需的行为和风险管理要求的深入分析。

Method: MATRIX框架包含三个组件：(1)基于安全工程方法的安全对齐临床场景分类法；(2)基于LLM的安全相关对话失败检测评估器BehvJudge；(3)能够生成多样化场景条件响应的模拟患者代理PatBot。

Result: BehvJudge使用Gemini 2.5-Pro达到专家级危险检测水平(F1 0.96，灵敏度0.999)，在240个对话的盲评中优于临床医生。PatBot在定量和定性评估中可靠地模拟真实患者行为。

Conclusion: MATRIX是首个将结构化安全工程与可扩展、经过验证的对话AI评估相统一的框架，支持监管机构对齐的安全审计，并发布了所有评估工具和数据集。

Abstract: Despite the growing use of large language models (LLMs) in clinical dialogue
systems, existing evaluations focus on task completion or fluency, offering
little insight into the behavioral and risk management requirements essential
for safety-critical systems. This paper presents MATRIX (Multi-Agent simulaTion
fRamework for safe Interactions and conteXtual clinical conversational
evaluation), a structured, extensible framework for safety-oriented evaluation
of clinical dialogue agents.
  MATRIX integrates three components: (1) a safety-aligned taxonomy of clinical
scenarios, expected system behaviors and failure modes derived through
structured safety engineering methods; (2) BehvJudge, an LLM-based evaluator
for detecting safety-relevant dialogue failures, validated against expert
clinician annotations; and (3) PatBot, a simulated patient agent capable of
producing diverse, scenario-conditioned responses, evaluated for realism and
behavioral fidelity with human factors expertise, and a patient-preference
study.
  Across three experiments, we show that MATRIX enables systematic, scalable
safety evaluation. BehvJudge with Gemini 2.5-Pro achieves expert-level hazard
detection (F1 0.96, sensitivity 0.999), outperforming clinicians in a blinded
assessment of 240 dialogues. We also conducted one of the first realism
analyses of LLM-based patient simulation, showing that PatBot reliably
simulates realistic patient behavior in quantitative and qualitative
evaluations. Using MATRIX, we demonstrate its effectiveness in benchmarking
five LLM agents across 2,100 simulated dialogues spanning 14 hazard scenarios
and 10 clinical domains.
  MATRIX is the first framework to unify structured safety engineering with
scalable, validated conversational AI evaluation, enabling regulator-aligned
safety auditing. We release all evaluation tools, prompts, structured
scenarios, and datasets.

Abstract: This paper revisits Ramon Llull's Ars combinatoria - a medieval framework for
generating knowledge through symbolic recombination - as a conceptual
foundation for building a modern Llull's thinking machine for research
ideation. Our approach defines three compositional axes: Theme (e.g.,
efficiency, adaptivity), Domain (e.g., question answering, machine
translation), and Method (e.g., adversarial training, linear attention). These
elements represent high-level abstractions common in scientific work -
motivations, problem settings, and technical approaches - and serve as building
blocks for LLM-driven exploration. We mine elements from human experts or
conference papers and show that prompting LLMs with curated combinations
produces research ideas that are diverse, relevant, and grounded in current
literature. This modern thinking machine offers a lightweight, interpretable
tool for augmenting scientific creativity and suggests a path toward
collaborative ideation between humans and AI.

Motivation: 现有过程奖励模型存在两个主要缺陷：作为分类器不提供解释，且依赖静态数据集的监督微调限制了泛化能力

Method: 提出生成式评判模型StepWiser，通过元推理对策略模型的推理步骤进行思考，输出思考标记后再给出最终判断，使用强化学习基于rollout的相对结果进行训练

Result: 在中间步骤判断准确性上优于现有方法，可用于改进策略模型训练，并提升推理时搜索效果

Conclusion: 将逐步奖励建模重构为推理任务是有效的，生成式评判模型能够提供更好的判断准确性和泛化能力

Abstract: As models increasingly leverage multi-step reasoning strategies to solve
complex problems, supervising the logical validity of these intermediate steps
has become a critical research challenge. Process reward models address this by
providing step-by-step feedback, but current approaches have two major
drawbacks: they typically function as classifiers without providing
explanations, and their reliance on supervised fine-tuning with static datasets
limits generalization. Inspired by recent advances, we reframe stepwise reward
modeling from a classification task to a reasoning task itself. We thus propose
a generative judge that reasons about the policy model's reasoning steps (i.e.,
meta-reasons), outputting thinking tokens before delivering a final verdict.
Our model, StepWiser, is trained by reinforcement learning using relative
outcomes of rollouts. We show it provides (i) better judgment accuracy on
intermediate steps than existing methods; (ii) can be used to improve the
policy model at training time; and (iii) improves inference-time search.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of interconnected devices, autonomous systems, and AI
applications has created severe fragmentation in adaptive transport systems,
where diverse protocols and context sources remain isolated. This survey
provides the first systematic investigation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
as a unifying paradigm, highlighting its ability to bridge protocol-level
adaptation with context-aware decision making. Analyzing established
literature, we show that existing efforts have implicitly converged toward
MCP-like architectures, signaling a natural evolution from fragmented solutions
to standardized integration frameworks. We propose a five-category taxonomy
covering adaptive mechanisms, context-aware frameworks, unification models,
integration strategies, and MCP-enabled architectures. Our findings reveal
three key insights: traditional transport protocols have reached the limits of
isolated adaptation, MCP's client-server and JSON-RPC structure enables
semantic interoperability, and AI-driven transport demands integration
paradigms uniquely suited to MCP. Finally, we present a research roadmap
positioning MCP as a foundation for next-generation adaptive, context-aware,
and intelligent transport infrastructures.

Abstract: Deep understanding of electromagnetic signals is fundamental to dynamic
spectrum management, intelligent transportation, autonomous driving and
unmanned vehicle perception. The field faces challenges because electromagnetic
signals differ greatly from text and images, showing high heterogeneity, strong
background noise and complex joint time frequency structure, which prevents
existing general models from direct use. Electromagnetic communication and
sensing tasks are diverse, current methods lack cross task generalization and
transfer efficiency, and the scarcity of large high quality datasets blocks the
creation of a truly general multitask learning framework. To overcome these
issue, we introduce EMind, an electromagnetic signals foundation model that
bridges large scale pretraining and the unique nature of this modality. We
build the first unified and largest standardized electromagnetic signal dataset
covering multiple signal types and tasks. By exploiting the physical properties
of electromagnetic signals, we devise a length adaptive multi-signal packing
method and a hardware-aware training strategy that enable efficient use and
representation learning from heterogeneous multi-source signals. Experiments
show that EMind achieves strong performance and broad generalization across
many downstream tasks, moving decisively from task specific models to a unified
framework for electromagnetic intelligence. The code is available at:

Conclusion: 该方法为推理中心的训练提供了认知基础扎实、可解释的课程学习框架，推动了更有效的LLM训练方法发展。

Abstract: Curriculum learning for training LLMs requires a difficulty signal that
aligns with reasoning while remaining scalable and interpretable. We propose a
simple premise: tasks that demand deeper depth of thought for humans should
also be harder for models. Accordingly, we define difficulty as depth of
thought (DoT) and operationalize it by counting the discrete steps in a teacher
model's reasoning trace (e.g., Chain-of-Thought). We then train with a shallow
to deep curriculum ordered by this DoT and outline how to derive, validate, and
schedule it at scale. Our position yields three testable hypotheses: (i) DoT
correlates with conventional difficulty on reasoning benchmarks, (ii)
DoT-ordered curricula outperform length- or judge-scored curricula under
matched budgets, and (iii) the difficulty is robust across teacher models given
light formatting controls. We propose an evaluation framework and discuss
threats to validity (teacher style, length confounds) alongside practical
mitigations. Taken together, we aim to move toward cognitively grounded,
interpretable curricula for reasoning-centric training.

Abstract: A main open question in contemporary AI research is quantifying the forms of
reasoning neural networks can perform when perfectly trained. This paper
answers this by interpreting reasoning tasks as circuit emulation, where the
gates define the type of reasoning; e.g. Boolean gates for predicate logic,
tropical circuits for dynamic programming, arithmetic and analytic gates for
symbolic mathematical representation, and hybrids thereof for deeper reasoning;
e.g. higher-order logic.
  We present a systematic meta-algorithm that converts essentially any circuit
into a feedforward neural network (NN) with ReLU activations by iteratively
replacing each gate with a canonical ReLU MLP emulator. We show that, on any
digital computer, our construction emulates the circuit exactly--no
approximation, no rounding, modular overflow included--demonstrating that no
reasoning task lies beyond the reach of neural networks. The number of neurons
in the resulting network (parametric complexity) scales with the circuit's
complexity, and the network's computational graph (structure) mirrors that of
the emulated circuit. This formalizes the folklore that NNs networks trade
algorithmic run-time (circuit runtime) for space complexity (number of
neurons).
  We derive a range of applications of our main result, from emulating
shortest-path algorithms on graphs with cubic--size NNs, to simulating stopped
Turing machines with roughly quadratically--large NNs, and even the emulation
of randomized Boolean circuits. Lastly, we demonstrate that our result is
strictly more powerful than a classical universal approximation theorem: any
universal function approximator can be encoded as a circuit and directly
emulated by a NN.

Abstract: Accurately predicting the drift (displacement) of leeway objects in maritime
environments remains a critical challenge, particularly in time-sensitive
scenarios such as search and rescue operations. In this study, we propose a
multi-modal machine learning framework that integrates Sentence Transformer
embeddings with attention-based sequence-to-sequence architectures to predict
the drift of leeway objects in water. We begin by experimentally collecting
environmental and physical data, including water current and wind velocities,
object mass, and surface area, for five distinct leeway objects. Using
simulated data from a Navier-Stokes-based model to train a convolutional neural
network on geometrical image representations, we estimate drag and lift
coefficients of the leeway objects. These coefficients are then used to derive
the net forces responsible for driving the objects' motion. The resulting time
series, comprising physical forces, environmental velocities, and
object-specific features, combined with textual descriptions encoded via a
language model, are inputs to attention-based sequence-to-sequence
long-short-term memory and Transformer models, to predict future drift
trajectories. We evaluate the framework across multiple time horizons ($1$,
$3$, $5$, and $10$ seconds) and assess its generalization across different
objects. We compare our approach against a fitted physics-based model and
traditional machine learning methods, including recurrent neural networks and
temporal convolutional neural networks. Our results show that these multi-modal
models perform comparably to traditional models while also enabling longer-term
forecasting in place of single-step prediction. Overall, our findings
demonstrate the ability of a multi-modal modeling strategy to provide accurate
and adaptable predictions of leeway object drift in dynamic maritime
conditions.

TL;DR: 提出基于主动学习和相似性搜索的新型异常检测框架，用于解决APT攻击检测中的类别不平衡问题，通过注意力自编码器和相似性度量优化样本选择，显著提升检测精度和标签效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: APT攻击具有隐蔽性强和检测数据集中类别极端不平衡的特点，传统方法难以有效检测，需要开发能够在有限监督下提高检测鲁棒性的新方法。

Method: 基于注意力自编码器的主动学习框架，利用特征空间相似性搜索识别正常和异常样本，通过多种相似性度量的形式化评估来优化样本选择和异常排序。

Result: 在包括DARPA透明计算APT痕迹在内的多个数据集上实验表明，相似性度量的选择显著影响模型收敛速度、异常检测准确率和标签效率。

Conclusion: 为威胁情报和网络防御领域的主动学习流水线提供了相似性函数选择的可操作指导，证明了相似性度量在提升APT检测性能中的关键作用。

Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) pose a severe challenge to cyber defense
due to their stealthy behavior and the extreme class imbalance inherent in
detection datasets. To address these issues, we propose a novel active
learning-based anomaly detection framework that leverages similarity search to
iteratively refine the decision space. Built upon an Attention-Based
Autoencoder, our approach uses feature-space similarity to identify normal-like
and anomaly-like instances, thereby enhancing model robustness with minimal
oracle supervision. Crucially, we perform a formal evaluation of various
similarity measures to understand their influence on sample selection and
anomaly ranking effectiveness. Through experiments on diverse datasets,
including DARPA Transparent Computing APT traces, we demonstrate that the
choice of similarity metric significantly impacts model convergence, anomaly
detection accuracy, and label efficiency. Our results offer actionable insights
for selecting similarity functions in active learning pipelines tailored for
threat intelligence and cyber defense.

Conclusion: 该方法可用于支持储层管理决策，包括预判有害行为、优化生产和注入参数、分析概率事件影响，以最大化石油采收率

Abstract: Forecasting production reliably and anticipating changes in the behavior of
rock-fluid systems are the main challenges in petroleum reservoir engineering.
This project proposes to deal with this problem through a data-driven approach
and using machine learning methods. The objective is to develop a methodology
to forecast production parameters based on simple data as produced and injected
volumes and, eventually, gauges located in wells, without depending on
information from geological models, fluid properties or details of well
completions and flow systems. Initially, we performed relevance analyses of the
production and injection variables, as well as conditioning the data to suit
the problem. As reservoir conditions change over time, concept drift is a
priority concern and require special attention to those observation windows and
the periodicity of retraining, which are also objects of study. For the
production forecasts, we study supervised learning methods, such as those based
on regressions and Neural Networks, to define the most suitable for our
application in terms of performance and complexity. In a first step, we
evaluate the methodology using synthetic data generated from the UNISIM III
compositional simulation model. Next, we applied it to cases of real plays in
the Brazilian pre-salt. The expected result is the design of a reliable
predictor for reproducing reservoir dynamics, with rapid response, capability
of dealing with practical difficulties such as restrictions in wells and
processing units, and that can be used in actions to support reservoir
management, including the anticipation of deleterious behaviors, optimization
of production and injection parameters and the analysis of the effects of
probabilistic events, aiming to maximize oil recovery.

Motivation: 现有抑郁检测系统需要长时间数据采集，无法满足早期识别的紧急需求，特别是在资源稀缺的发展中国家地区

Method: 开发了一种快速工具，在1秒内采集过去7天的应用使用数据，使用多种机器学习模型和特征选择方法，包括稳定特征选择和Boruta全相关特征选择

Result: light gradient boosting模型使用稳定特征选择方法，正确识别82.4%抑郁学生（精确度75%，F1分数78.5%）；堆叠模型使用约5个特征，最高精确度达77.4%（平衡准确度77.9%）

Conclusion: 该系统速度快、简洁易用，特别适合资源稀缺的发展中国家地区的抑郁症识别，为开发更少资源消耗的系统提供了有价值的见解

Abstract: Background: Existing robust, pervasive device-based systems developed in
recent years to detect depression require data collected over a long period and
may not be effective in cases where early detection is crucial.
  Objective: Our main objective was to develop a minimalistic system to
identify depression using data retrieved in the fastest possible time.
  Methods: We developed a fast tool that retrieves the past 7 days' app usage
data in 1 second (mean 0.31, SD 1.10 seconds). A total of 100 students from
Bangladesh participated in our study, and our tool collected their app usage
data. To identify depressed and nondepressed students, we developed a diverse
set of ML models. We selected important features using the stable approach,
along with 3 main types of feature selection (FS) approaches.
  Results: Leveraging only the app usage data retrieved in 1 second, our light
gradient boosting machine model used the important features selected by the
stable FS approach and correctly identified 82.4% (n=42) of depressed students
(precision=75%, F1-score=78.5%). Moreover, after comprehensive exploration, we
presented a parsimonious stacking model where around 5 features selected by the
all-relevant FS approach Boruta were used in each iteration of validation and
showed a maximum precision of 77.4% (balanced accuracy=77.9%). A SHAP analysis
of our best models presented behavioral markers that were related to
depression.
  Conclusions: Due to our system's fast and minimalistic nature, it may make a
worthwhile contribution to identifying depression in underdeveloped and
developing regions. In addition, our detailed discussion about the implication
of our findings can facilitate the development of less resource-intensive
systems to better understand students who are depressed.

Result: 在自闭症谱系障碍和阿尔茨海默病上验证，NeuroPathX优于基线方法，揭示了与疾病相关的生物学可信关联。

Conclusion: NeuroPathX有潜力推进对复杂脑部疾病的理解，代码已开源。

Abstract: While imaging-genetics holds great promise for unraveling the complex
interplay between brain structure and genetic variation in neurological
disorders, traditional methods are limited to simplistic linear models or to
black-box techniques that lack interpretability. In this paper, we present
NeuroPathX, an explainable deep learning framework that uses an early fusion
strategy powered by cross-attention mechanisms to capture meaningful
interactions between structural variations in the brain derived from MRI and
established biological pathways derived from genetics data. To enhance
interpretability and robustness, we introduce two loss functions over the
attention matrix - a sparsity loss that focuses on the most salient
interactions and a pathway similarity loss that enforces consistent
representations across the cohort. We validate NeuroPathX on both autism
spectrum disorder and Alzheimer's disease. Our results demonstrate that
NeuroPathX outperforms competing baseline approaches and reveals biologically
plausible associations linked to the disorder. These findings underscore the
potential of NeuroPathX to advance our understanding of complex brain
disorders. Code is available at https://github.com/jueqiw/NeuroPathX .

Method: 提出统一的本体(样本级)鲁棒性框架SALMAN，采用新颖的距离映射失真(DMD)度量，通过比较输入到输出的距离映射来评估样本敏感性，具有近线性复杂度。

Result: 在攻击效率和鲁棒训练方面取得了显著提升，证明了该框架的有效性。

Conclusion: SALMAN框架作为一个实用的、模型无关的工具，可用于提升基于Transformer的NLP系统的可靠性。

Abstract: Recent strides in pretrained transformer-based language models have propelled
state-of-the-art performance in numerous NLP tasks. Yet, as these models grow
in size and deployment, their robustness under input perturbations becomes an
increasingly urgent question. Existing robustness methods often diverge between
small-parameter and large-scale models (LLMs), and they typically rely on
labor-intensive, sample-specific adversarial designs. In this paper, we propose
a unified, local (sample-level) robustness framework (SALMAN) that evaluates
model stability without modifying internal parameters or resorting to complex
perturbation heuristics. Central to our approach is a novel Distance Mapping
Distortion (DMD) measure, which ranks each sample's susceptibility by comparing
input-to-output distance mappings in a near-linear complexity manner. By
demonstrating significant gains in attack efficiency and robust training, we
position our framework as a practical, model-agnostic tool for advancing the
reliability of transformer-based NLP systems.

establish representer theorems for time dependent OV-RKHS interpolation, derive
Sobolev type approximation bounds for smooth vector fields, and provide

This framework supports efficient reduced order modeling and long term

Motivation: 传统位置编码方法在长序列建模中存在长期衰减问题，需要一种既能有效编码位置信息又能保持计算效率的新方法。

Method: 提出复数位置编码(CoPE)，使用复数嵌入表示，实部处理语义内容，虚部编码位置信息；在第一层使用相位感知注意力机制捕获位置依赖模式，后续层使用标准注意力。

Result: 在GLUE基准测试中表现优于RoPE、正弦和可学习位置编码，且计算复杂度更低，不出现长期衰减问题，兼容线性注意力。

Conclusion: CoPE通过复数编码方式有效整合内容和位置信息，在保持高性能的同时降低了计算复杂度，为位置编码提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of position encoding in
transformer architectures. By incorporating positional information, this
approach provides essential guidance for modeling dependencies between elements
across different sequence positions. We introduce CoPE (a lightweight Complex
Positional Encoding), a novel architecture that leverages complex-valued
encoding to encode both content and positional information. Our approach
replaces traditional positional encodings with complex embeddings where the
real part captures semantic content and the imaginary part encodes positional
information. We introduce phase-aware attention in the first layer of the
transformer model to capture position-dependent patterns, followed by standard
attention layers for higher-levels. We show that CoPE doesn't exhibit long term
decay and is compatible with linear attention. Experimental evaluation on the
GLUE benchmark suggest that our approach achieves superior performance with
less computational complexity, compared to RoPE, Sinusoidal and Learned
positional encodings.

Motivation: 尽管DPO被广泛采用，但偏好数据分布特征如何影响DPO性能的基本问题仍未解决，需要系统研究偏好数据分布对DPO的理论和实证影响。

Method: 通过理论分析和大量实验，系统研究偏好数据分布对DPPO的影响，包括分析最优响应分布、在线DPO设置，以及在多样化任务上进行广泛实验验证。

Conclusion: 研究结果解释了广泛采用策略背后的机制，并为构建高质量偏好数据集提供了实用见解，强调被选择回答质量在LLM对齐中的主导作用。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple and effective
approach for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences,
bypassing the need for a learned reward model. Despite its growing adoption, a
fundamental question remains open: what characteristics of preference data are
most critical for DPO performance? In this work, we provide a systematic study
of how preference data distribution influences DPO, from both theoretical and
empirical perspectives. We show that the quality of chosen responses plays a
dominant role in optimizing the DPO objective, while the quality of rejected
responses may have relatively limited impact. Our theoretical analysis
characterizes the optimal response distribution under DPO and reveals how
contrastiveness between responses helps primarily by improving the chosen
samples. We further study an online DPO setting and show it effectively reduces
to supervised fine-tuning on the chosen responses. Extensive experiments across
diverse tasks confirm our findings: improving the quality of chosen responses
consistently boosts performance regardless of the quality of the rejected
responses. We also investigate the benefit of mixing the on-policy data. Our
results interpret the mechanism behind some widely adopted strategies and offer
practical insights for constructing high-impact preference datasets for LLM
alignment.

Method: 利用大语言模型提取医学代码语义关系构建知识图谱，设计分层表示学习框架捕获三个层次（医学代码、医院访问、患者）的上下文表示，并在每个层次融入原型信息捕获内在相似性。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上的五个临床任务（死亡率预测、再入院预测、住院时长预测、药物推荐、表型预测）中，ProtoEHR相比基线方法能够做出更准确、鲁棒和可解释的预测。

Conclusion: ProtoEHR框架通过充分利用EHR数据的层次结构，不仅提高了预测性能，还提供了代码、访问和患者三个层次的可解释性洞察，有助于医疗预测决策。

Abstract: Digital healthcare systems have enabled the collection of mass healthcare
data in electronic healthcare records (EHRs), allowing artificial intelligence
solutions for various healthcare prediction tasks. However, existing studies
often focus on isolated components of EHR data, limiting their predictive
performance and interpretability. To address this gap, we propose ProtoEHR, an
interpretable hierarchical prototype learning framework that fully exploits the
rich, multi-level structure of EHR data to enhance healthcare predictions. More
specifically, ProtoEHR models relationships within and across three
hierarchical levels of EHRs: medical codes, hospital visits, and patients. We
first leverage large language models to extract semantic relationships among
medical codes and construct a medical knowledge graph as the knowledge source.
Building on this, we design a hierarchical representation learning framework
that captures contextualized representations across three levels, while
incorporating prototype information within each level to capture intrinsic
similarities and improve generalization. To perform a comprehensive assessment,
we evaluate ProtoEHR in two public datasets on five clinically significant
tasks, including prediction of mortality, prediction of readmission, prediction
of length of stay, drug recommendation, and prediction of phenotype. The
results demonstrate the ability of ProtoEHR to make accurate, robust, and
interpretable predictions compared to baselines in the literature. Furthermore,
ProtoEHR offers interpretable insights on code, visit, and patient levels to
aid in healthcare prediction.

Abstract: High dropout and failure rates in distance education pose a significant
challenge for academic institutions, making the proactive identification of
at-risk students crucial for providing timely support. This study develops and
evaluates a machine learning model based on early academic performance and
digital engagement patterns from the large-scale OULAD dataset to predict
student risk at a UK university. To address the practical challenges of data
privacy and institutional silos that often hinder such initiatives, we
implement the model using a Federated Learning (FL) framework. We compare model
complexity (Logistic Regression vs. a Deep Neural Network) and data balancing.
The final federated model demonstrates strong predictive capability, achieving
an ROC AUC score of approximately 85% in identifying at-risk students. Our
findings show that this federated approach provides a practical and scalable

Conclusion: 该框架为开放工业环境中的风电数据协作分析提供了安全、隐私保护且高效的解决方案，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Wind power data often suffers from missing values due to sensor faults and
unstable transmission at edge sites. While federated learning enables
privacy-preserving collaboration without sharing raw data, it remains
vulnerable to anomalous updates and privacy leakage during parameter exchange.
These challenges are amplified in open industrial environments, necessitating
zero-trust mechanisms where no participant is inherently trusted. To address
these challenges, this work proposes ZTFed-MAS2S, a zero-trust federated
learning framework that integrates a multi-head attention-based
sequence-to-sequence imputation model. ZTFed integrates verifiable differential
privacy with non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs and a confidentiality and
integrity verification mechanism to ensure verifiable privacy preservation and
secure model parameters transmission. A dynamic trust-aware aggregation
mechanism is employed, where trust is propagated over similarity graphs to
enhance robustness, and communication overhead is reduced via sparsity- and
quantization-based compression. MAS2S captures long-term dependencies in wind
power data for accurate imputation. Extensive experiments on real-world wind
farm datasets validate the superiority of ZTFed-MAS2S in both federated
learning performance and missing data imputation, demonstrating its
effectiveness as a secure and efficient solution for practical applications in
the energy sector.

TL;DR: HSIC是当前最先进的统计依赖性评估方法，但计算复杂度高（O(n^2.37)），不适用于大数据样本。本文提出HCR（分层相关性重建）作为线性成本的替代方案，具有更高的依赖性敏感性，并能提供联合分布模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HSIC方法虽然先进，但其O(n^2.37)的计算复杂度使其无法处理大规模数据样本，需要开发更高效的替代方案。

Method: 提出HCR（分层相关性重建）方法，通过特征混合矩来描述依赖性，从相关性和同方差性开始，可以线性时间（O(n)）计算单个依赖特征。

Result: HCR不仅计算成本低（线性时间），而且在测试中表现出比HSIC更高的依赖性敏感性，同时还能提供实际的联合分布模型和近似互信息。

Conclusion: HCR是HSIC的高效替代方案，具有线性计算复杂度、更高的敏感性，并能提供更丰富的依赖性描述，适用于大规模数据分析。

Abstract: Evaluation of statistical dependencies between two data samples is a basic
problem of data science/machine learning, and HSIC (Hilbert-Schmidt Information
Criterion)~\cite{HSIC} is considered the state-of-art method. However, for size
$n$ data sample it requires multiplication of $n\times n$ matrices, what
currently needs $\sim O(n^{2.37})$ computational complexity~\cite{mult}, making
it impractical for large data samples. We discuss HCR (Hierarchical Correlation
Reconstruction) as its linear cost practical alternative of even higher
dependence sensitivity in tests, and additionally providing actual joint
distribution model by description of dependencies through features being mixed
moments, starting with correlation and homoscedasticity, also allowing to
approximate mutual information as just sum of squares of such nontrivial mixed
moments between two data samples. Such single dependence describing feature is
calculated in $O(n)$ linear time. Their number to test varies with dimension
$d$ - requiring $O(d^2)$ for pairwise dependencies, $O(d^3)$ if wanting to also
consider more subtle triplewise, and so on.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) has become a mainstream architecture for building
Large Language Models (LLMs) by reducing per-token computation while enabling
model scaling. It can be viewed as partitioning a large Feed-Forward Network
(FFN) at the tensor level into fine-grained sub-FFNs, or experts, and
activating only a sparse subset for each input. While this sparsity improves
efficiency, MoE still faces substantial challenges due to their massive
computational scale and unpredictable activation patterns.
  To enable efficient MoE deployment, we identify dual sparsity at the tensor
and neuron levels in pre-trained MoE modules as a key factor for both accuracy
and efficiency. Unlike prior work that increases tensor-level sparsity through
finer-grained expert design during pre-training, we introduce post-training
expert partitioning to induce such sparsity without retraining. This preserves
the mathematical consistency of model transformations and enhances both
efficiency and accuracy in subsequent fine-tuning and inference. Building upon
this, we propose DualSparse-MoE, an inference system that integrates dynamic
tensor-level computation dropping with static neuron-level reconstruction to
deliver significant efficiency gains with minimal accuracy loss.
  Experimental results show that enforcing an approximate 25% drop rate with
our approach reduces average accuracy by only 0.08%-0.28% across three
prevailing MoE models, while nearly all degrees of computation dropping
consistently yield proportional computational speedups. Furthermore,
incorporating load-imbalance awareness into expert parallelism achieves a 1.41x
MoE module speedup with just 0.5% average accuracy degradation.

Abstract: The groundbreaking performance of deep neural networks (NNs) promoted a surge
of interest in providing a mathematical basis to deep learning theory. Low-rank
tensor decompositions are specially befitting for this task due to their close
connection to NNs and their rich theoretical results. Different tensor
decompositions have strong uniqueness guarantees, which allow for a direct
interpretation of their factors, and polynomial time algorithms have been
proposed to compute them. Through the connections between tensors and NNs, such
results supported many important advances in the theory of NNs. In this review,
we show how low-rank tensor methods--which have been a core tool in the signal
processing and machine learning communities--play a fundamental role in
theoretically explaining different aspects of the performance of deep NNs,
including their expressivity, algorithmic learnability and computational
hardness, generalization, and identifiability. Our goal is to give an
accessible overview of existing approaches (developed by different communities,
ranging from computer science to mathematics) in a coherent and unified way,
and to open a broader perspective on the use of low-rank tensor decompositions
for the theory of deep NNs.

*André Quadros,Cassio Silva,Ronnie Alves*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出结合变分状态内在奖励(VSIMR)和大型语言模型(LLM)内在奖励两种策略，在稀疏奖励环境中显著提升强化学习代理的性能和采样效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决极端稀疏奖励环境中传统强化学习因正反馈稀少而难以有效学习的问题，通过结合两种内在动机策略来提高学习效率。

Method: 集成VSIMR（使用VAE奖励状态新颖性）和LLM内在奖励（利用预训练知识基于环境和目标描述生成奖励信号），在MiniGrid DoorKey环境中使用Actor-Critic (A2C)代理实现。

Result: 组合策略相比单独使用任一策略或标准A2C代理，显著提高了代理性能和采样效率，标准A2C代理完全无法学习。

Conclusion: VSIMR驱动新状态探索，LLM奖励促进目标导向的渐进利用，两种策略在环境和任务的不同方面形成有效互补。

Abstract: This paper explores the combination of two intrinsic motivation strategies to
improve the efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL) agents in environments
with extreme sparse rewards, where traditional learning struggles due to
infrequent positive feedback. We propose integrating Variational State as
Intrinsic Reward (VSIMR), which uses Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) to reward
state novelty, with an intrinsic reward approach derived from Large Language
Models (LLMs). The LLMs leverage their pre-trained knowledge to generate reward
signals based on environment and goal descriptions, guiding the agent. We
implemented this combined approach with an Actor-Critic (A2C) agent in the
MiniGrid DoorKey environment, a benchmark for sparse rewards. Our empirical
results show that this combined strategy significantly increases agent
performance and sampling efficiency compared to using each strategy
individually or a standard A2C agent, which failed to learn. Analysis of
learning curves indicates that the combination effectively complements
different aspects of the environment and task: VSIMR drives exploration of new
states, while the LLM-derived rewards facilitate progressive exploitation
towards goals.

Motivation: 传统贝叶斯优化在高维空间中面临挑战，TuRBO方法使用局部高斯过程虽然能避免过度探索，但采样效率较低。需要一种既能保持异质建模又能提高采样效率的方法。

Method: 使用全局高斯过程的梯度和Hessian矩阵构建多个局部二次模型，通过求解边界约束二次规划问题选择新采样点，解决了高维空间中高斯过程梯度消失的问题。

Result: 通过收敛性分析和实验证明，该方法显著提升了TuRBO的效果，在合成函数和实际应用中优于多种高维贝叶斯优化技术。

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功结合了全局建模的高效性和局部建模的准确性，为高维贝叶斯优化提供了有效的解决方案，在保持异质建模的同时显著提高了采样效率。

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has been widely applied to optimize expensive
black-box functions while retaining sample efficiency. However, scaling BO to
high-dimensional spaces remains challenging. Existing literature proposes
performing standard BO in multiple local trust regions (TuRBO) for
heterogeneous modeling of the objective function and avoiding over-exploration.
Despite its advantages, using local Gaussian Processes (GPs) reduces sampling
efficiency compared to a global GP. To enhance sampling efficiency while
preserving heterogeneous modeling, we propose to construct multiple local
quadratic models using gradients and Hessians from a global GP, and select new
sample points by solving the bound-constrained quadratic program. Additionally,
we address the issue of vanishing gradients of GPs in high-dimensional spaces.
We provide a convergence analysis and demonstrate through experimental results
that our method enhances the efficacy of TuRBO and outperforms a wide range of
high-dimensional BO techniques on synthetic functions and real-world
applications.

Motivation: 硬件描述语言(HDLs)如Verilog在代码生成领域中研究较少，主要因难点包括并发语义、语法严格性和模拟复杂性。需要专门的方法来解决这些挑战。

Method: 1）构建Veribench-53K高质量数据集；2）提出Trace-back重新评分机制，利用推理路径和迭代精炼提高奖励可靠性；3）采用样本均衡权重策略，基于奖励-概率分布调节学习动态；4）集成到迭代RL流水线中，共同进化策略和奖励模型。

Conclusion: 这个工作显示了强化学习驱动方法在硬件相关领域结构化代码生成中的潜力，通过专门的奖励机制和学习策略有效解决了HDL代码生成的特有挑战。

Abstract: Recent advancements in code generation have shown remarkable success across
software domains, yet hardware description languages (HDLs) such as Verilog
remain underexplored due to their concurrency semantics, syntactic rigidity,
and simulation complexity. In this work, we address these challenges by
introducing a reinforcement learning (RL) framework tailored for Verilog code
generation. We first construct Veribench-53K, a high-quality dataset curated
from over 700K Verilog problems, enriched with structured prompts, complexity
labels, and diverse testbenches. To tackle the problem of sparse and noisy
reward signals, we propose a Trace-back based Rescore mechanism that leverages
reasoning paths and iterative refinement to enhance feedback reliability and
support reward model training. Furthermore, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting
and overfitting during RL fine-tuning, we introduce a sample-balanced weighting
strategy that adaptively balances learning dynamics based on reward-probability
distributions. These innovations are integrated into an iterative RL pipeline
that co-evolves the policy and reward models. In contrast to recent work such
as CraftRTL, which relies on large-scale closed-source model distillation, and
DeepSeek-style approaches that struggle with sparse feedback, our method
demonstrates superior performance using a smaller but high-quality dataset
combined with RL optimization. Experiments on Verilog generation tasks
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with substantial gains in test pass
rate, functional correctness, and compilation robustness. Our findings
highlight the potential of RL-driven approaches for structured code generation
in hardware-centric domains. VERIRL is publicly available at

Result: 在Yahoo A1和A2基准数据集上表现优于最先进的无监督和半监督方法，保持高精度和召回率

Conclusion: 该框架为实际异常检测任务提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案

Abstract: Anomaly detection in time series data is important for applications in
finance, healthcare, sensor networks, and industrial monitoring. Traditional
methods usually struggle with limited labeled data, high false-positive rates,
and difficulty generalizing to novel anomaly types. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a reinforcement learning-based framework that integrates
dynamic reward shaping, Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and active learning,
called DRTA. Our method uses an adaptive reward mechanism that balances
exploration and exploitation by dynamically scaling the effect of VAE-based
reconstruction error and classification rewards. This approach enables the
agent to detect anomalies effectively in low-label systems while maintaining
high precision and recall. Our experimental results on the Yahoo A1 and Yahoo
A2 benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches. These
findings show that our framework is a scalable and efficient solution for
real-world anomaly detection tasks.

Motivation: 机器遗忘旨在从训练好的模型中移除特定数据的影响，同时保持对剩余数据的性能。虽然已有工作暗示记忆化与增强之间存在联系，但系统性的增强设计在机器遗忘中的作用仍未得到充分研究。

Method: 研究了不同数据增强策略（包括SalUn、随机标签和微调）对遗忘方法性能的影响，在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上，通过不同的遗忘率进行实验。

Result: 实验结果显示，使用TrivialAug增强时，平均差距遗忘指标最多可减少40.12%，表明适当的增强设计能显著提高遗忘效果。

Conclusion: 数据增强不仅有助于减少记忆化，还在实现隐私保护和高效遗忘方面发挥着关键作用。

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of specific data from a
trained model while preserving its performance on the remaining data. Although
a few works suggest connections between memorisation and augmentation, the role
of systematic augmentation design in MU remains under-investigated. In this
work, we investigate the impact of different data augmentation strategies on
the performance of unlearning methods, including SalUn, Random Label, and
Fine-Tuning. Experiments conducted on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, under varying
forget rates, show that proper augmentation design can significantly improve
unlearning effectiveness, reducing the performance gap to retrained models.
Results showed a reduction of up to 40.12% of the Average Gap unlearning
Metric, when using TrivialAug augmentation. Our results suggest that
augmentation not only helps reduce memorization but also plays a crucial role
in achieving privacy-preserving and efficient unlearning.

Conclusion: 该方法为机器学习技术与量子算法设计的整合开辟了有前景的途径，RL驱动的参数初始化能够加速VQAs的可扩展性和实际部署

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) have gained prominence as a viable
framework for exploiting near-term quantum devices in applications ranging from
optimization and chemistry simulation to machine learning. However, the
effectiveness of VQAs is often constrained by the so-called barren plateau
problem, wherein gradients diminish exponentially as system size or circuit
depth increases, thereby hindering training. In this work, we propose a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based initialization strategy to alleviate the
barren plateau issue by reshaping the initial parameter landscape to avoid
regions prone to vanishing gradients. In particular, we explore several RL
algorithms (Deterministic Policy Gradient, Soft Actor-Critic, and Proximal
Policy Optimization, etc.) to generate the circuit parameters (treated as
actions) that minimize the VQAs cost function before standard gradient-based
optimization. By pre-training with RL in this manner, subsequent optimization
using methods such as gradient descent or Adam proceeds from a more favorable
initial state. Extensive numerical experiments under various noise conditions
and tasks consistently demonstrate that the RL-based initialization method
significantly enhances both convergence speed and final solution quality.
Moreover, comparisons among different RL algorithms highlight that multiple
approaches can achieve comparable performance gains, underscoring the
flexibility and robustness of our method. These findings shed light on a
promising avenue for integrating machine learning techniques into quantum
algorithm design, offering insights into how RL-driven parameter initialization
can accelerate the scalability and practical deployment of VQAs. Opening up a
promising path for the research community in machine learning for quantum,
especially barren plateau problems in VQAs.

Conclusion: BTW框架有效解决了多模态学习中噪声模态的问题，提供了可扩展的实例级模态权重控制，无需额外参数即可提升模型性能

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become increasingly powerful in
multimodal learning by enabling modular specialization across modalities.
However, their effectiveness remains unclear when additional modalities
introduce more noise than complementary information. Existing approaches, such
as the Partial Information Decomposition, struggle to scale beyond two
modalities and lack the resolution needed for instance-level control. We
propose Beyond Two-modality Weighting (BTW), a bi-level, non-parametric
weighting framework that combines instance-level Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence and modality-level mutual information (MI) to dynamically adjust
modality importance during training. Our method does not require additional
parameters and can be applied to an arbitrary number of modalities.
Specifically, BTW computes per-example KL weights by measuring the divergence
between each unimodal and the current multimodal prediction, and modality-wide
MI weights by estimating global alignment between unimodal and multimodal
outputs. Extensive experiments on sentiment regression and clinical
classification demonstrate that our method significantly improves regression
performance and multiclass classification accuracy.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is a crucial task that guides the design of new
compounds, including drugs and materials. While explainable artificial
intelligence methods aim to scrutinize model predictions by identifying
influential molecular substructures, many existing approaches rely on masking
strategies that remove either atoms or atom-level features to assess importance
via fidelity metrics. These methods, however, often fail to adhere to the
underlying molecular distribution and thus yield unintuitive explanations. In
this work, we propose counterfactual masking, a novel framework that replaces
masked substructures with chemically reasonable fragments sampled from
generative models trained to complete molecular graphs. Rather than evaluating
masked predictions against implausible zeroed-out baselines, we assess them
relative to counterfactual molecules drawn from the data distribution. Our
method offers two key benefits: (1) molecular realism underpinning robust and
distribution-consistent explanations, and (2) meaningful counterfactuals that
directly indicate how structural modifications may affect predicted properties.
We demonstrate that counterfactual masking is well-suited for benchmarking
model explainers and yields more actionable insights across multiple datasets
and property prediction tasks. Our approach bridges the gap between
explainability and molecular design, offering a principled and generative path
toward explainable machine learning in chemistry.

Abstract: A recent paper, ``A Graphon-Signal Analysis of Graph Neural Networks'', by
Levie, analyzed message passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) by embedding the
input space of MPNNs, i.e., attributed graphs (graph-signals), to a space of
attributed graphons (graphon-signals). Based on extensions of standard results
in graphon analysis to graphon-signals, the paper proved a generalization bound
and a sampling lemma for MPNNs. However, there are some missing ingredients in
that paper, limiting its applicability in practical settings of graph machine
learning. In the current paper, we introduce several refinements and extensions
to existing results that address these shortcomings. In detail, 1) we extend
the main results in the paper to graphon-signals with multidimensional signals
(rather than 1D signals), 2) we extend the Lipschitz continuity to MPNNs with
readout with respect to cut distance (rather than MPNNs without readout with
respect to cut metric), 3) we improve the generalization bound by utilizing
robustness-type generalization bounds, and 4) we extend the analysis to
non-symmetric graphons and kernels.

Motivation: 传统数据驱动方法在复杂系统中长期预测精度下降，自回归训练需要大量GPU内存且可能牺牲短期性能

Result: 在Burgers方程和浅水基准测试中，SPF比自回归方法获得更高的长期精度，同时降低内存需求

Conclusion: SPF框架为资源受限和复杂模拟提供了有前景的解决方案，平衡了短期和长期性能

Abstract: Data-driven methods are emerging as efficient alternatives to traditional
numerical forecasting, offering fast inference and lower computational cost.
Yet, for complex systems, long-term accuracy often deteriorates due to error
accumulation, and autoregressive training (though effective) demands large GPU
memory and may sacrifice short-term performance. We propose the Stochastic
PushForward (SPF) framework, which retains one-step-ahead training while
enabling multi-step learning. SPF builds a supplementary dataset from model
predictions and combines it with ground truth via a stochastic acquisition
strategy, balancing short- and long-term performance while reducing
overfitting. Multi-step predictions are precomputed between epochs, keeping
memory usage stable without storing full unrolled sequences. Experiments on the
Burgers' equation and the Shallow Water benchmark show that SPF achieves higher
long-term accuracy than autoregressive methods while lowering memory
requirements, making it promising for resource-limited and complex simulations.

Conclusion: SAEs为低数据量蛋白质功能预测和设计提供了有效的解决方案，其稀疏表示能够更好地从有限数据中泛化并利用pLM表示中的生物基序

Abstract: Predicting protein function from amino acid sequence remains a central
challenge in data-scarce (low-$N$) regimes, limiting machine learning-guided
protein design when only small amounts of assay-labeled sequence-function data
are available. Protein language models (pLMs) have advanced the field by
providing evolutionary-informed embeddings and sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have
enabled decomposition of these embeddings into interpretable latent variables
that capture structural and functional features. However, the effectiveness of
SAEs for low-$N$ function prediction and protein design has not been
systematically studied. Herein, we evaluate SAEs trained on fine-tuned ESM2
embeddings across diverse fitness extrapolation and protein engineering tasks.
We show that SAEs, with as few as 24 sequences, consistently outperform or
compete with their ESM2 baselines in fitness prediction, indicating that their
sparse latent space encodes compact and biologically meaningful representations
that generalize more effectively from limited data. Moreover, steering
predictive latents exploits biological motifs in pLM representations, yielding
top-fitness variants in 83% of cases compared to designing with ESM2 alone.

Abstract: Drug discovery is a complex and resource-intensive process, making early
prediction of approval outcomes critical for optimizing research investments.
While classical machine learning and deep learning methods have shown promise
in drug approval prediction, their limited interpretability constraints their
impact. Here, we present DrugReasoner, a reasoning-based large language model
(LLM) built on the LLaMA architecture and fine-tuned with group relative policy
optimization (GRPO) to predict the likelihood of small-molecule approval.
DrugReasoner integrates molecular descriptors with comparative reasoning
against structurally similar approved and unapproved compounds, generating
predictions alongside step-by-step rationales and confidence scores.
DrugReasoner achieved robust performance with an AUC of 0.732 and an F1 score
of 0.729 on the validation set and 0.725 and 0.718 on the test set,
respectively. These results outperformed conventional baselines, including
logistic regression, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbors and had
competitive performance relative to XGBoost. On an external independent
dataset, DrugReasoner outperformed both baseline and the recently developed
ChemAP model, achieving an AUC of 0.728 and an F1-score of 0.774, while
maintaining high precision and balanced sensitivity, demonstrating robustness
in real-world scenarios. These findings demonstrate that DrugReasoner not only
delivers competitive predictive accuracy but also enhances transparency through
its reasoning outputs, thereby addressing a key bottleneck in AI-assisted drug
discovery. This study highlights the potential of reasoning-augmented LLMs as

TL;DR: RhymeRL是一个针对大语言模型强化学习的系统，通过历史相似性分析提升GPU利用率，实现2.6倍性能提升且不损失准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RL系统存在GPU利用率低的问题，主要原因是rollout阶段占主导地位和rollout长度不平衡导致的GPU气泡。传统异步执行和截断方法可能牺牲训练准确性

Method: 提出RhymeRL系统，包含两个创新：1) HistoSpec - 基于历史rollout令牌序列相似性的推测解码推理引擎；2) HistoPipe - 基于历史rollout分布相似性的两层调度策略

Result: 在真实生产环境中验证，支持从几十到数千个GPU的扩展，相比现有方法实现2.6倍性能提升

Conclusion: RhymeRL通过利用历史rollout的相似性特征，有效解决了RL训练中的GPU利用率问题，在保持准确性的同时显著提升了训练效率

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), reinforcement
learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal methodology for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. Unlike traditional pre-training approaches, RL
encompasses multiple stages: rollout, reward, and training, which necessitates
collaboration among various worker types. However, current RL systems continue
to grapple with substantial GPU underutilization, due to two primary factors:
(1) The rollout stage dominates the overall RL process due to test-time
scaling; (2) Imbalances in rollout lengths (within the same batch) result in
GPU bubbles. While prior solutions like asynchronous execution and truncation
offer partial relief, they may compromise training accuracy for efficiency.
  Our key insight stems from a previously overlooked observation: rollout
responses exhibit remarkable similarity across adjacent training epochs. Based
on the insight, we introduce RhymeRL, an LLM RL system designed to accelerate
RL training with two key innovations. First, to enhance rollout generation, we
present HistoSpec, a speculative decoding inference engine that utilizes the
similarity of historical rollout token sequences to obtain accurate drafts.
Second, to tackle rollout bubbles, we introduce HistoPipe, a two-tier
scheduling strategy that leverages the similarity of historical rollout
distributions to balance workload among rollout workers. We have evaluated
RhymeRL within a real production environment, demonstrating scalability from
dozens to thousands of GPUs. Experimental results demonstrate that RhymeRL
achieves a 2.6x performance improvement over existing methods, without
compromising accuracy or modifying the RL paradigm.

Abstract: The principal portfolio approach is an emerging method in signal-based
trading. However, these principal portfolios may not be diversified to explore
the key features of the prediction matrix or robust to different situations. To
address this problem, we propose a novel linear trading position with sparse
spectrum that can explore a larger spectral region of the prediction matrix. We
also develop a Krasnosel'ski\u \i-Mann fixed-point algorithm to optimize this
trading position, which possesses the descent property and achieves a linear
convergence rate in the objective value. This is a new theoretical result for
this type of algorithms. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method
achieves good and robust performance in various situations.

Motivation: 解决时间序列数据中训练和测试数据集之间分布偏移的挑战，提高模型在未标记测试数据上的泛化能力和鲁棒性

Method: 多尺度混合输入架构捕获不同尺度特征，结合基于证据学习的不确定性感知机制，通过狄利克雷先验进行目标预测和不确定性估计

Result: 在多个基准数据集上达到最先进性能，显著降低预期校准误差(ECE)，表明预测置信度校准更好

Conclusion: 混合输入架构与不确定性感知机制的结合在时间序列无监督域自适应中非常有效，能显著提升目标域性能并改善预测校准

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation methods seek to generalize effectively on
unlabeled test data, especially when encountering the common challenge in time
series data that distribution shifts occur between training and testing
datasets. In this paper, we propose incorporating multi-scale feature
extraction and uncertainty estimation to improve the model's generalization and
robustness across domains. Our approach begins with a multi-scale mixed input
architecture that captures features at different scales, increasing training
diversity and reducing feature discrepancies between the training and testing
domains. Based on the mixed input architecture, we further introduce an
uncertainty awareness mechanism based on evidential learning by imposing a
Dirichlet prior on the labels to facilitate both target prediction and
uncertainty estimation. The uncertainty awareness mechanism enhances domain
adaptation by aligning features with the same labels across different domains,
which leads to significant performance improvements in the target domain.
Additionally, our uncertainty-aware model demonstrates a much lower Expected
Calibration Error (ECE), indicating better-calibrated prediction confidence.
Our experimental results show that this combined approach of mixed input
architecture with the uncertainty awareness mechanism achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple benchmark datasets, underscoring its effectiveness
in unsupervised domain adaptation for time series data.

TL;DR: STRATA-TS是一个针对时间序列数据稀缺城市的预测框架，通过选择性迁移学习和检索增强推理来改善城市预测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市预测模型面临严重的数据不平衡问题：少数城市有密集的长期记录，而许多其他城市只有短期或不完整的历史数据。直接迁移不可靠，因为只有有限的源模式真正有益于目标域

Method: 结合领域自适应检索和推理能力强大的大模型，使用基于补丁的时间编码器识别与目标查询语义和动态对齐的源子序列，然后通过LLM进行检索引导的结构化推理

Result: 在新加坡、诺丁汉和格拉斯哥的三个停车可用性数据集上，STRATA-TS始终优于强预测和迁移基线，同时提供可解释的知识迁移路径

Conclusion: 该框架通过选择性迁移和检索增强推理，有效解决了数据稀缺城市的预测问题，并通过监督微调实现了高效部署

Abstract: Urban forecasting models often face a severe data imbalance problem: only a
few cities have dense, long-span records, while many others expose short or
incomplete histories. Direct transfer from data-rich to data-scarce cities is
unreliable because only a limited subset of source patterns truly benefits the
target domain, whereas indiscriminate transfer risks introducing noise and
negative transfer. We present STRATA-TS (Selective TRAnsfer via TArget-aware
retrieval for Time Series), a framework that combines domain-adapted retrieval
with reasoning-capable large models to improve forecasting in scarce data
regimes. STRATA-TS employs a patch-based temporal encoder to identify source
subsequences that are semantically and dynamically aligned with the target
query. These retrieved exemplars are then injected into a retrieval-guided
reasoning stage, where an LLM performs structured inference over target inputs
and retrieved support. To enable efficient deployment, we distill the reasoning
process into a compact open model via supervised fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on three parking availability datasets across Singapore,
Nottingham, and Glasgow demonstrate that STRATA-TS consistently outperforms
strong forecasting and transfer baselines, while providing interpretable
knowledge transfer pathways.

TL;DR: BDVAE是一种新型深度学习模型，通过整合多组学数据和生物学通路信息，准确预测免疫检查点抑制剂治疗反应并揭示耐药机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习方法缺乏可解释性，未能有效利用多组学数据的生物学结构来理解免疫治疗的耐药机制。

Method: 开发了生物学解缠变分自编码器(BDVAE)，使用模态和通路特异性编码器整合转录组和基因组数据，通过变分推理学习生物学意义的潜在特征。

Result: 在366名患者的泛癌队列中，BDVAE实现了0.94的AUC-ROC预测准确率，揭示了免疫抑制、代谢转变和神经元信号等关键耐药机制。

Conclusion: BDVAE证明了生物学结构化机器学习在阐明复杂耐药模式和指导精准免疫治疗策略中的价值，揭示了耐药是一个连续的生物学谱系而非二元状态。

Abstract: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed cancer treatment, yet
patient responses remain highly variable, and the biological mechanisms
underlying resistance are poorly understood. While machine learning models hold
promise for predicting responses to ICIs, most existing methods lack
interpretability and do not effectively leverage the biological structure
inherent to multi-omics data. Here, we introduce the Biologically Disentangled
Variational Autoencoder (BDVAE), a deep generative model that integrates
transcriptomic and genomic data through modality- and pathway-specific
encoders. Unlike existing rigid, pathway-informed models, BDVAE employs a
modular encoder architecture combined with variational inference to learn
biologically meaningful latent features associated with immune, genomic, and
metabolic processes. Applied to a pan-cancer cohort of 366 patients across four
cancer types treated with ICIs, BDVAE accurately predicts treatment response
(AUC-ROC = 0.94 on unseen test data) and uncovers critical resistance
mechanisms, including immune suppression, metabolic shifts, and neuronal
signaling. Importantly, BDVAE reveals that resistance spans a continuous
biological spectrum rather than strictly binary states, reflecting gradations
of tumor dysfunction. Several latent features correlate with survival outcomes
and known clinical subtypes, demonstrating BDVAE's capability to generate
interpretable, clinically relevant insights. These findings underscore the
value of biologically structured machine learning in elucidating complex
resistance patterns and guiding precision immunotherapy strategies.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的多模态金融风险评估框架，整合文本情感和从高管声带动态中提取的副语言线索，能够预测股票波动性而非方向性收益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融市场中的信息不对称问题，特别是经过策略性构建的企业叙述，削弱了传统文本分析的有效性，需要新的方法来解码隐藏的企业不确定性。

Method: 使用物理信息声学模型(PIAM)从收益电话会议中提取情感特征，将声学和文本情感状态投影到三维情感状态标签空间(紧张度、稳定性、唤醒度)，分析高管从脚本演讲到自发问答的情感动态变化。

Result: 多模态特征能够解释高达43.8%的30天已实现波动性的样本外方差，波动性预测主要由高管从脚本到自发演讲过渡期间的情感动态驱动，特别是CFO的文本稳定性降低和声学不稳定性增加，以及CEO的显著唤醒度变化。

Conclusion: 该方法通过从可验证的生物特征信号中解码不确定性标记，为投资者和监管机构提供了增强市场可解释性和识别隐藏企业不确定性的强大工具，多模态方法显著优于仅使用财务数据的基准模型。

Abstract: Information asymmetry in financial markets, often amplified by strategically
crafted corporate narratives, undermines the effectiveness of conventional
textual analysis. We propose a novel multimodal framework for financial risk
assessment that integrates textual sentiment with paralinguistic cues derived
from executive vocal tract dynamics in earnings calls. Central to this
framework is the Physics-Informed Acoustic Model (PIAM), which applies
nonlinear acoustics to robustly extract emotional signatures from raw
teleconference sound subject to distortions such as signal clipping. Both
acoustic and textual emotional states are projected onto an interpretable
three-dimensional Affective State Label (ASL) space-Tension, Stability, and
Arousal. Using a dataset of 1,795 earnings calls (approximately 1,800 hours),
we construct features capturing dynamic shifts in executive affect between
scripted presentation and spontaneous Q&A exchanges. Our key finding reveals a
pronounced divergence in predictive capacity: while multimodal features do not
forecast directional stock returns, they explain up to 43.8% of the
out-of-sample variance in 30-day realized volatility. Importantly, volatility
predictions are strongly driven by emotional dynamics during executive
transitions from scripted to spontaneous speech, particularly reduced textual
stability and heightened acoustic instability from CFOs, and significant
arousal variability from CEOs. An ablation study confirms that our multimodal
approach substantially outperforms a financials-only baseline, underscoring the
complementary contributions of acoustic and textual modalities. By decoding
latent markers of uncertainty from verifiable biometric signals, our
methodology provides investors and regulators a powerful tool for enhancing
market interpretability and identifying hidden corporate uncertainty.

Motivation: 随着基础模型向AGI发展，在隐私和资源约束下进行微调变得至关重要。联邦学习通过联邦微调(FFT)提供了解决方案，但现有的LoRA-based FFT在异构FL环境中面临结构不兼容和非IID数据适应性差的问题。

Method: 提出FFT MoE框架：1) 用稀疏MoE适配器替代LoRA；2) 每个客户端训练轻量级门控网络选择激活个性化专家子集；3) 引入异构感知辅助损失动态正则化路由分布，确保专家多样性和平衡利用。

Result: 在IID和非IID条件下的广泛实验表明，FFT MoE在泛化性能和训练效率方面始终优于最先进的FFT基线方法。

Conclusion: FFT MoE框架有效解决了联邦微调中的异构性挑战，通过MoE适配器和智能路由机制实现了更好的适应性和效率，为隐私保护的分布式模型微调提供了有力解决方案。

Abstract: As FMs drive progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI),
fine-tuning them under privacy and resource constraints has become increasingly
critical particularly when highquality training data resides on distributed
edge devices. Federated Learning (FL) offers a compelling solution through
Federated Fine-Tuning (FFT), which enables collaborative model adaptation
without sharing raw data. Recent approaches incorporate Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques such as Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to reduce
computational overhead. However, LoRA-based FFT faces two major limitations in
heterogeneous FL environments: structural incompatibility across clients with
varying LoRA configurations and limited adaptability to non-IID data
distributions, which hinders convergence and generalization. To address these
challenges, we propose FFT MoE, a novel FFT framework that replaces LoRA with
sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) adapters. Each client trains a lightweight
gating network to selectively activate a personalized subset of experts,
enabling fine-grained adaptation to local resource budgets while preserving
aggregation compatibility. To further combat the expert load imbalance caused
by device and data heterogeneity, we introduce a heterogeneity-aware auxiliary
loss that dynamically regularizes the routing distribution to ensure expert
diversity and balanced utilization. Extensive experiments spanning both IID and
non-IID conditions demonstrate that FFT MoE consistently outperforms state of
the art FFT baselines in generalization performance and training efficiency.

Result: 实验发现现有近似机器学习遗忘算法可能无意中损害差分隐私模型中保留样本的隐私

Conclusion: 需要开发差分隐私遗忘算法来确保保留样本的隐私保护，研究提供了实用的审计方法和代码实现

Abstract: Approximate machine unlearning aims to remove the effect of specific data
from trained models to ensure individuals' privacy. Existing methods focus on
the removed records and assume the retained ones are unaffected. However,
recent studies on the \emph{privacy onion effect} indicate this assumption
might be incorrect. Especially when the model is differentially private, no
study has explored whether the retained ones still meet the differential
privacy (DP) criterion under existing machine unlearning methods. This paper
takes a holistic approach to auditing both unlearned and retained samples'
privacy risks after applying approximate unlearning algorithms. We propose the
privacy criteria for unlearned and retained samples, respectively, based on the
perspectives of DP and membership inference attacks (MIAs). To make the
auditing process more practical, we also develop an efficient MIA, A-LiRA,
utilizing data augmentation to reduce the cost of shadow model training. Our
experimental findings indicate that existing approximate machine unlearning
algorithms may inadvertently compromise the privacy of retained samples for
differentially private models, and we need differentially private unlearning
algorithms. For reproducibility, we have pubished our code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的经验缩放定律主要针对密集模型，而MoE模型引入了新的稀疏维度，需要研究稀疏性如何影响不同能力机制（记忆vs推理）。

Method: 训练了多个MoE Transformer家族，系统性地改变总参数、激活参数和top-k路由，同时保持计算预算不变，记录预训练损失、下游任务损失和准确率。

Result: 记忆基准随总参数单调改善，而推理性能会饱和甚至回归；改变top-k对性能影响很小；经典超参数调节泛化间隙的方向与稀疏性相同。

Conclusion: MoE稀疏性对记忆和推理能力有不同影响，推理能力在过度稀疏时会受损且难以恢复，需要更细致的稀疏性设计来平衡不同能力。

Abstract: Empirical scaling laws have driven the evolution of large language models
(LLMs), yet their coefficients shift whenever the model architecture or data
pipeline changes. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, now standard in
state-of-the-art systems, introduce a new sparsity dimension that current
dense-model frontiers overlook. We investigate how MoE sparsity influences two
distinct capability regimes: memorization and reasoning. We train families of
MoE Transformers that systematically vary total parameters, active parameters,
and top-$k$ routing while holding the compute budget fixed. For every model we
record pre-training loss, downstream task loss, and task accuracy, allowing us
to separate the train-test generalization gap from the loss-accuracy gap.
Memorization benchmarks improve monotonically with total parameters, mirroring
training loss. By contrast, reasoning performance saturates and can even
regress despite continued gains in both total parameters and training loss.
Altering top-$k$ alone has little effect when active parameters are constant,
and classic hyperparameters such as learning rate and initialization modulate
the generalization gap in the same direction as sparsity. Neither post-training
reinforcement learning (GRPO) nor extra test-time compute rescues the reasoning
deficit of overly sparse models. Our model checkpoints, code and logs are
open-source at https://github.com/rioyokotalab/optimal-sparsity.

Motivation: 现有方法要么通过微调获得数据集特定性能但缺乏泛化性，要么通过零样本提示保持泛化性但无法充分利用训练数据。需要一种能兼顾两者的方法。

Method: 首先通过提示获取训练数据的思维链响应，对错误响应生成提示条件以避免错误，验证后构建提示条件库。推理时检索最相关的提示条件作为额外上下文。

Conclusion: LRTab成功整合了微调和零样本提示的优势，通过从训练数据中学习并检索相关提示条件，实现了既保持泛化性又充分利用训练数据的表格推理方法。

Abstract: Automated tabular understanding and reasoning are essential tasks for data
scientists. Recently, Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly
prevalent in tabular reasoning tasks. Previous work focuses on (1) finetuning
LLMs using labeled data or (2) Training-free prompting LLM agents using
chain-of-thought (CoT). Finetuning offers dataset-specific learning at the cost
of generalizability. Training-free prompting is highly generalizable but does
not take full advantage of training data. In this paper, we propose a novel
prompting-based reasoning approach, Learn then Retrieve: LRTab, which
integrates the benefits of both by retrieving relevant information learned from
training data. We first use prompting to obtain CoT responses over the training
data. For incorrect CoTs, we prompt the LLM to predict Prompt Conditions to
avoid the error, learning insights from the data. We validate the effectiveness
of Prompt Conditions using validation data. Finally, at inference time, we
retrieve the most relevant Prompt Conditions for additional context for table
understanding. We provide comprehensive experiments on WikiTQ and Tabfact,
showing that LRTab is interpretable, cost-efficient, and can outperform
previous baselines in tabular reasoning.

Motivation: 传统机器学习方法依赖手动特征工程，难以处理电子健康记录中不规则、不完整的时间序列数据，需要开发更有效的脓毒症早期检测方法。

Method: 使用无监督自编码器进行自动特征提取，结合多层感知器分类器；采用定制下采样策略提取高信息密度片段，以及非重叠动态滑动窗口机制进行实时推理；使用带缺失指示器的固定维度向量表示时间序列数据。

Result: 在三个ICU队列中分别获得74.6%、80.6%和93.5%的准确率，显著优于Naive Bayes、SVM、Random Forest和XGBoost等传统机器学习基线方法。

Conclusion: 该端到端框架展现出优异的鲁棒性、泛化能力和临床实用性，适用于异构ICU环境中的早期脓毒症检测。

Abstract: Sepsis is a life threatening condition that requires timely detection in
intensive care settings. Traditional machine learning approaches, including
Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and XGBoost, often
rely on manual feature engineering and struggle with irregular, incomplete
time-series data commonly present in electronic health records. We introduce an
end-to-end deep learning framework integrating an unsupervised autoencoder for
automatic feature extraction with a multilayer perceptron classifier for binary
sepsis risk prediction. To enhance clinical applicability, we implement a
customized down sampling strategy that extracts high information density
segments during training and a non-overlapping dynamic sliding window mechanism
for real-time inference. Preprocessed time series data are represented as fixed
dimension vectors with explicit missingness indicators, mitigating bias and
noise. We validate our approach on three ICU cohorts. Our end-to-end model
achieves accuracies of 74.6 percent, 80.6 percent, and 93.5 percent,
respectively, consistently outperforming traditional machine learning
baselines. These results demonstrate the framework's superior robustness,
generalizability, and clinical utility for early sepsis detection across
heterogeneous ICU environments.

Motivation: 开发一个理论严谨且计算高效的框架，将高维图像特征压缩到低维空间，同时保持分类性能，通过物理启发的嵌入方法实现参数效率的大幅提升。

Method: 使用冻结的MobileNetV2提取特征，构建MET-QC-LDPC图表示随机键Ising模型，在Nishimori温度下运行，利用拓扑指导设计球形和环形图结构，抑制有害的陷阱集。

Result: 在ImageNet-10上达到98.7%准确率，ImageNet-100上达到82.7%准确率，实现40倍参数压缩（从1280维压缩到32-64维），计算速度比二分法快6倍。

Conclusion: 拓扑指导的图设计能够产生高效、物理启发的嵌入，在保持最先进性能的同时实现显著的参数压缩，证明了统计物理和代数拓扑在机器学习中的实用价值。

Abstract: We present a unified framework combining statistical physics, coding theory,
and algebraic topology for efficient multi-class image classification.
High-dimensional feature vectors from a frozen MobileNetV2 backbone are
interpreted as spins on a sparse Multi-Edge Type quasi-cyclic LDPC
(MET-QC-LDPC) graph, forming a Random-Bond Ising Model (RBIM). We operate this
RBIM at its Nishimori temperature, $\beta_N$, where the smallest eigenvalue of
the Bethe-Hessian matrix vanishes, maximizing class separability.
  Our theoretical contribution establishes a correspondence between local
trapping sets in the code's graph and topological invariants (Betti numbers,
bordism classes) of the feature manifold. A practical algorithm estimates
$\beta_N$ efficiently with a quadratic interpolant and Newton correction,
achieving a six-fold speed-up over bisection.
  Guided by topology, we design spherical and toroidal MET-QC-LDPC graph
ensembles, using permanent bounds to suppress harmful trapping sets. This
compresses 1280-dimensional features to 32 or 64 dimensions for ImageNet-10 and
-100 subsets. Despite massive compression (40x fewer parameters), we achieve
98.7% accuracy on ImageNet-10 and 82.7% on ImageNet-100, demonstrating that
topology-guided graph design yields highly efficient, physics-inspired
embeddings with state-of-the-art performance.

Result: 在各种质量估计任务上显著优于现有技术，建立了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: 结合结构学习和跨阶段监督的方法在RTL设计质量估计中非常有效。

Abstract: Estimating the quality of register transfer level (RTL) designs is crucial in
the electronic design automation (EDA) workflow, as it enables instant feedback
on key metrics like area and delay without the need for time-consuming logic
synthesis. While recent approaches have leveraged large language models (LLMs)
to derive embeddings from RTL code and achieved promising results, they
overlook the structural semantics essential for accurate quality estimation. In
contrast, the control data flow graph (CDFG) view exposes the design's
structural characteristics more explicitly, offering richer cues for
representation learning. In this work, we introduce a novel structure-aware
graph self-supervised learning framework, StructRTL, for improved RTL design
quality estimation. By learning structure-informed representations from CDFGs,
our method significantly outperforms prior art on various quality estimation
tasks. To further boost performance, we incorporate a knowledge distillation
strategy that transfers low-level insights from post-mapping netlists into the
CDFG predictor. Experiments show that our approach establishes new
state-of-the-art results, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining
structural learning with cross-stage supervision.

Motivation: 联邦学习的去中心化特性限制了训练过程的可见性，依赖客户端诚实性，使得恶意拜占庭客户端可以通过提交虚假模型更新来毒化训练过程。

Method: 采用两阶段防御框架：第一阶段使用符号时间序列变换（SAX）放大良性模型和恶意模型之间的差异，第二阶段使用谱聚类准确检测对抗行为，并集成基于FFT的鲁棒聚合函数作为最终防护层。

Result: 在五种投毒攻击（从简单标签翻转到自适应优化策略）的严格评估中，该方法在检测精度和最终模型准确性方面均优于最先进的防御方法，即使在强对抗条件下也能保持持续高性能。

Conclusion: FLAegis框架有效提升了联邦学习系统对拜占庭攻击的防御能力，通过创新的检测和聚合机制确保了训练过程的安全性和模型质量。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has become a powerful technique for training Machine
Learning (ML) models in a decentralized manner, preserving the privacy of the
training datasets involved. However, the decentralized nature of FL limits the
visibility of the training process, relying heavily on the honesty of
participating clients. This assumption opens the door to malicious third
parties, known as Byzantine clients, which can poison the training process by
submitting false model updates. Such malicious clients may engage in poisoning
attacks, manipulating either the dataset or the model parameters to induce
misclassification. In response, this study introduces FLAegis, a two-stage
defensive framework designed to identify Byzantine clients and improve the
robustness of FL systems. Our approach leverages symbolic time series
transformation (SAX) to amplify the differences between benign and malicious
models, and spectral clustering, which enables accurate detection of
adversarial behavior. Furthermore, we incorporate a robust FFT-based
aggregation function as a final layer to mitigate the impact of those Byzantine
clients that manage to evade prior defenses. We rigorously evaluate our method
against five poisoning attacks, ranging from simple label flipping to adaptive
optimization-based strategies. Notably, our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art defenses in both detection precision and final model accuracy,
maintaining consistently high performance even under strong adversarial
conditions.

*Enoch H. Kang,Kyoungseok Jang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了离线强化学习和离线逆强化学习中Bellman残差最小化(BRM)方法的统计性能，提出了新的稳定性分析和风险界限


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前离线强化学习实践中Bellman一致性难以保证，虽然已有基于随机梯度下降-上升的BRM全局收敛方法，但其在离线设置下的统计行为尚未充分研究

Method: 引入单个Lyapunov势函数来耦合相邻数据集上的SGDA运行，获得O(1/n)的平均参数稳定性界限，并将此稳定性常数转化为BRM的O(1/n)超额风险界限

Result: 获得了比凸凹鞍点问题已知最佳样本复杂度指数高一倍的稳定性界限，且无需方差缩减、额外正则化或小批量采样的严格独立性假设

Conclusion: 该方法适用于标准神经网络参数化和小批量SGD，为离线BRM提供了理论保证

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning and offline inverse reinforcement learning aim
to recover near-optimal value functions or reward models from a fixed batch of
logged trajectories, yet current practice still struggles to enforce Bellman
consistency. Bellman residual minimization (BRM) has emerged as an attractive
remedy, as a globally convergent stochastic gradient descent-ascent based
method for BRM has been recently discovered. However, its statistical behavior
in the offline setting remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we close this
statistical gap. Our analysis introduces a single Lyapunov potential that
couples SGDA runs on neighbouring datasets and yields an O(1/n) on-average
argument-stability bound-doubling the best known sample-complexity exponent for
convex-concave saddle problems. The same stability constant translates into the
O(1/n) excess risk bound for BRM, without variance reduction, extra
regularization, or restrictive independence assumptions on minibatch sampling.
The results hold for standard neural-network parameterizations and minibatch
SGD.

TL;DR: 提出基于约束缩减的MILP模型简化方法，通过识别关键紧约束并转化为等式来加速求解，相比现有方法提升解质量50%以上，减少计算时间17.47%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型简化方法主要基于变量缩减，而约束缩减这一对偶视角被忽视。约束缩减通过将不等式约束转化为等式也能降低MILP复杂度，但面临识别关键约束和高效预测的挑战

Method: 首先标记最优解处的紧约束作为潜在关键约束，设计启发式规则选择关键子集；提出多模态表示技术，利用实例级和抽象级MILP表述信息来学习关键紧约束

Result: 实验结果表明，相比最先进方法，该方法提升解质量超过50%，减少计算时间17.47%

Conclusion: 约束缩减是MILP模型简化的有效方法，多模态表示技术能有效识别关键约束，显著提升求解效率和解质量

Abstract: Model reduction, which aims to learn a simpler model of the original mixed
integer linear programming (MILP), can solve large-scale MILP problems much
faster. Most existing model reduction methods are based on variable reduction,
which predicts a solution value for a subset of variables. From a dual
perspective, constraint reduction that transforms a subset of inequality
constraints into equalities can also reduce the complexity of MILP, but has
been largely ignored. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constraint-based
model reduction approach for the MILP. Constraint-based MILP reduction has two
challenges: 1) which inequality constraints are critical such that reducing
them can accelerate MILP solving while preserving feasibility, and 2) how to
predict these critical constraints efficiently. To identify critical
constraints, we first label these tight-constraints at the optimal solution as
potential critical constraints and design a heuristic rule to select a subset
of critical tight-constraints. To learn the critical tight-constraints, we
propose a multi-modal representation technique that leverages information from
both instance-level and abstract-level MILP formulations. The experimental
results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method
improves the quality of the solution by over 50\% and reduces the computation
time by 17.47\%.

TL;DR: UltraMemV2是一种改进的内存层架构，通过五项关键改进实现了与8专家MoE模型相当的性能，同时显著降低内存访问成本，在内存密集型任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决混合专家(MoE)模型在推理时内存访问成本高的问题，同时超越之前内存层架构只能匹配2专家MoE模型的性能限制，达到与先进8专家MoE模型相当的性能水平。

Method: 五项关键改进：1)在每个transformer块中集成内存层；2)使用单线性投影简化值扩展；3)采用基于FFN的值处理；4)实施原则性参数初始化；5)重新平衡内存与FFN的计算比例。

Result: UltraMemV2在相同计算和参数条件下达到与8专家MoE模型相当的性能，内存访问显著降低。在内存密集型任务上表现突出：长上下文记忆+1.6分，多轮记忆+6.2分，上下文学习+7.9分。验证了激活密度比稀疏参数总数对性能影响更大。

Conclusion: UltraMemV2使内存层架构达到了与最先进MoE模型相当的性能水平，为高效稀疏计算提供了一个有吸引力的替代方案。

Abstract: While Mixture of Experts (MoE) models achieve remarkable efficiency by
activating only subsets of parameters, they suffer from high memory access
costs during inference. Memory-layer architectures offer an appealing
alternative with very few memory access, but previous attempts like UltraMem
have only matched the performance of 2-expert MoE models, falling significantly
short of state-of-the-art 8-expert configurations. We present UltraMemV2, a
redesigned memory-layer architecture that closes this performance gap. Our
approach introduces five key improvements: integrating memory layers into every
transformer block, simplifying value expansion with single linear projections,
adopting FFN-based value processing from PEER, implementing principled
parameter initialization, and rebalancing memory-to-FFN computation ratios.
Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that UltraMemV2 achieves
performance parity with 8-expert MoE models under same computation and
parameters but significantly low memory access. Notably, UltraMemV2 shows
superior performance on memory-intensive tasks, with improvements of +1.6
points on long-context memorization, +6.2 points on multi-round memorization,
and +7.9 points on in-context learning. We validate our approach at scale with
models up to 2.5B activated parameters from 120B total parameters, and
establish that activation density has greater impact on performance than total
sparse parameter count. Our work brings memory-layer architectures to
performance parity with state-of-the-art MoE models, presenting a compelling
alternative for efficient sparse computation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Governance-as-a-Service (GaaS)框架，作为分布式AI系统的运行时治理层，通过声明式规则和信任评分机制来强制执行策略，而不需要修改模型内部结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统向分布式生态系统发展，现有监督机制存在反应性、脆弱性和缺乏可审计性等问题，需要可扩展的解耦治理方案。

Method: 采用模块化、策略驱动的执行层，使用声明式规则和信任因子机制对代理进行评分，支持强制、规范和自适应干预。

Result: 在三个模拟场景中测试显示，GaaS能可靠地阻止或重定向高风险行为，同时保持吞吐量，信任评分能有效跟踪规则遵守情况。

Conclusion: GaaS将治理定位为运行时服务，为可互操作的代理生态系统建立了基础设施级别的对齐机制，不是教导代理道德，而是强制执行道德规范。

Abstract: As AI systems evolve into distributed ecosystems with autonomous execution,
asynchronous reasoning, and multi-agent coordination, the absence of scalable,
decoupled governance poses a structural risk. Existing oversight mechanisms are
reactive, brittle, and embedded within agent architectures, making them
non-auditable and hard to generalize across heterogeneous deployments.
  We introduce Governance-as-a-Service (GaaS): a modular, policy-driven
enforcement layer that regulates agent outputs at runtime without altering
model internals or requiring agent cooperation. GaaS employs declarative rules
and a Trust Factor mechanism that scores agents based on compliance and
severity-weighted violations. It enables coercive, normative, and adaptive
interventions, supporting graduated enforcement and dynamic trust modulation.
  To evaluate GaaS, we conduct three simulation regimes with open-source models
(LLaMA3, Qwen3, DeepSeek-R1) across content generation and financial
decision-making. In the baseline, agents act without governance; in the second,
GaaS enforces policies; in the third, adversarial agents probe robustness. All
actions are intercepted, evaluated, and logged for analysis. Results show that
GaaS reliably blocks or redirects high-risk behaviors while preserving
throughput. Trust scores track rule adherence, isolating and penalizing
untrustworthy components in multi-agent systems.
  By positioning governance as a runtime service akin to compute or storage,
GaaS establishes infrastructure-level alignment for interoperable agent
ecosystems. It does not teach agents ethics; it enforces them.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了聚合学习中异质性客户端标签集问题，对比了公开标签集和私有标签集设置下的模型性能，并提出了适配标准聚合学习方法的方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际应用中异质性客户端标签集常见但缺乏研究，尤其是当客户端仅与中央服务器共享标签集时存在更大挑战。

Method: 采用中心化调优的分类器组合方法，并将标准聚合学习方法适配到私有标签集设置中。

Result: 实验显示每个客户端可用标签数量的减少会对所有方法的性能造成显著影响，但提出的适配方法在私有标签设置下表现与标准方法在公开设置下相似。

Conclusion: 客户端可以以很小的模型准确性代价获得更高的隐私保护，为聚合学习中的标签私有性问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Although common in real-world applications, heterogeneous client label sets
are rarely investigated in federated learning (FL). Furthermore, in the cases
they are, clients are assumed to be willing to share their entire label sets
with other clients. Federated learning with private label sets, shared only
with the central server, adds further constraints on learning algorithms and
is, in general, a more difficult problem to solve. In this work, we study the
effects of label set heterogeneity on model performance, comparing the public
and private label settings -- when the union of label sets in the federation is
known to clients and when it is not. We apply classical methods for the
classifier combination problem to FL using centralized tuning, adapt common FL
methods to the private label set setting, and discuss the justification of both
approaches under practical assumptions. Our experiments show that reducing the
number of labels available to each client harms the performance of all methods
substantially. Centralized tuning of client models for representational
alignment can help remedy this, but often at the cost of higher variance.
Throughout, our proposed adaptations of standard FL methods perform well,
showing similar performance in the private label setting as the standard
methods achieve in the public setting. This shows that clients can enjoy
increased privacy at little cost to model accuracy.

Result: 在四个皮肤病学和两个胸部X光数据集上的实验表明，SWiFT能持续减少模型偏差，在公平性和准确性指标上达到或超过最先进方法，并在多个分布外数据集上表现出更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SWiFT提供了一种高效、低成本的模型去偏解决方案，能够在保持诊断准确性的同时显著改善模型公平性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Machine Learning (ML) models can exhibit bias
in real-world scenarios, posing significant challenges in ethically sensitive
domains such as healthcare. Such bias can negatively affect model fairness,
model generalization abilities and further risks amplifying social
discrimination. There is a need to remove biases from trained models. Existing
debiasing approaches often necessitate access to original training data and
need extensive model retraining; they also typically exhibit trade-offs between
model fairness and discriminative performance. To address these challenges, we
propose Soft-Mask Weight Fine-Tuning (SWiFT), a debiasing framework that
efficiently improves fairness while preserving discriminative performance with
much less debiasing costs. Notably, SWiFT requires only a small external
dataset and only a few epochs of model fine-tuning. The idea behind SWiFT is to
first find the relative, and yet distinct, contributions of model parameters to
both bias and predictive performance. Then, a two-step fine-tuning process
updates each parameter with different gradient flows defined by its
contribution. Extensive experiments with three bias sensitive attributes
(gender, skin tone, and age) across four dermatological and two chest X-ray
datasets demonstrate that SWiFT can consistently reduce model bias while
achieving competitive or even superior diagnostic accuracy under common
fairness and accuracy metrics, compared to the state-of-the-art. Specifically,
we demonstrate improved model generalization ability as evidenced by superior
performance on several out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets.

Conclusion: 研究首次证明深度强化学习可以在Android恶意软件领域的动态环境中促进有效的恶意软件检测，并提高对概念漂移的弹性。

Abstract: Malware detection in real-world settings must deal with evolving threats,
limited labeling budgets, and uncertain predictions. Traditional classifiers,
without additional mechanisms, struggle to maintain performance under concept
drift in malware domains, as their supervised learning formulation cannot
optimize when to defer decisions to manual labeling and adaptation. Modern
malware detection pipelines combine classifiers with monthly active learning
(AL) and rejection mechanisms to mitigate the impact of concept drift. In this
work, we develop a novel formulation of malware detection as a one-step Markov
Decision Process and train a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent,
simultaneously optimizing sample classification performance and rejecting
high-risk samples for manual labeling. We evaluated the joint detection and
drift mitigation policy learned by the DRL-based Malware Detection (DRMD) agent
through time-aware evaluations on Android malware datasets subject to realistic
drift requiring multi-year performance stability. The policies learned under
these conditions achieve a higher Area Under Time (AUT) performance compared to
standard classification approaches used in the domain, showing improved
resilience to concept drift. Specifically, the DRMD agent achieved a
$5.18\pm5.44$, $14.49\pm12.86$, and $10.06\pm10.81$ average AUT performance
improvement for the classification only, classification with rejection, and
classification with rejection and AL settings, respectively. Our results
demonstrate for the first time that DRL can facilitate effective malware
detection and improved resiliency to concept drift in the dynamic environment
of the Android malware domain.

Motivation: 传统上下文决斗bandit模型只捕获用户在同一时间步对推荐项目的选择偏好，但用户在实际消费项目后能提供更可靠的比较反馈。为了利用这一特性，需要设计能够重用历史项目进行比较查询的新模型

Method: 算法每次推荐一个项目，用户消费后将其与历史消费项目进行比较。通过初始随机探索阶段积累多样化的历史记录，利用矩阵集中不等式证明历史丰富性，从而构建信息丰富的比较查询

Result: 理论分析证明了$O(\sqrt{T})$的遗憾上界，仿真实验表明重用历史项目进行比较比仅比较同时推荐的项目能显著降低遗憾

Conclusion: 提出的新bandit模型通过重用用户历史消费项目进行后消费比较，在保持理论性能保证的同时，显著提升了推荐系统的实际性能表现

Abstract: The contextual duelling bandit problem models adaptive recommender systems,
where the algorithm presents a set of items to the user, and the user's choice
reveals their preference. This setup is well suited for implicit choices users
make when navigating a content platform, but does not capture other possible
comparison queries. Motivated by the fact that users provide more reliable
feedback after consuming items, we propose a new bandit model that can be
described as follows. The algorithm recommends one item per time step; after
consuming that item, the user is asked to compare it with another item chosen
from the user's consumption history. Importantly, in our model, this comparison
item can be chosen without incurring any additional regret, potentially leading
to better performance. However, the regret analysis is challenging because of
the temporal dependency in the user's history. To overcome this challenge, we
first show that the algorithm can construct informative queries provided the
history is rich, i.e., satisfies a certain diversity condition. We then show
that a short initial random exploration phase is sufficient for the algorithm
to accumulate a rich history with high probability. This result, proven via
matrix concentration bounds, yields $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret guarantees.
Additionally, our simulations show that reusing past items for comparisons can
lead to significantly lower regret than only comparing between simultaneously
recommended items.

Abstract: Balancing sensitivity to new tasks and stability for retaining past knowledge
is crucial in continual learning (CL). Recently, sharpness-aware minimization
has proven effective in transfer learning and has also been adopted in
continual learning (CL) to improve memory retention and learning efficiency.
However, relying on zeroth-order sharpness alone may favor sharper minima over
flatter ones in certain settings, leading to less robust and potentially
suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{C}ontinual
\textbf{Flat}ness (\textbf{C-Flat}), a method that promotes flatter loss
landscapes tailored for CL. C-Flat offers plug-and-play compatibility, enabling
easy integration with minimal modifications to the code pipeline. Besides, we
present a general framework that integrates C-Flat into all major CL paradigms
and conduct comprehensive comparisons with loss-minima optimizers and
flat-minima-based CL methods. Our results show that C-Flat consistently
improves performance across a wide range of settings. In addition, we introduce
C-Flat++, an efficient yet effective framework that leverages selective
flatness-driven promotion, significantly reducing the update cost required by
C-Flat. Extensive experiments across multiple CL methods, datasets, and
scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed
approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/WanNaa/C-Flat.

Conclusion: MOCHA成功解决了时间点过程中多阶动态因果关系的发现问题，为复杂事件序列建模提供了有效的解决方案，具有优秀的预测性能和结构可解释性。

Abstract: Discovering complex causal dependencies in temporal point processes (TPPs) is
critical for modeling real-world event sequences. Existing methods typically
rely on static or first-order causal structures, overlooking the multi-order
and time-varying nature of causal relationships. In this paper, we propose
MOCHA, a novel framework for discovering multi-order dynamic causality in TPPs.
MOCHA characterizes multi-order influences as multi-hop causal paths over a
latent time-evolving graph. To model such dynamics, we introduce a time-varying
directed acyclic graph (DAG) with learnable structural weights, where
acyclicity and sparsity constraints are enforced to ensure structural validity.
We design an end-to-end differentiable framework that jointly models causal
discovery and TPP dynamics, enabling accurate event prediction and revealing
interpretable structures. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that MOCHA not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in event
prediction, but also reveals meaningful and interpretable causal structures.

TL;DR: HAEPO是一种新的探索性策略优化方法，通过历史聚合和轨迹级概率压缩来增强长时域任务的探索能力，比现有方法表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如DPO和GRPO在长时域任务中探索能力有限，需要一种能够更好利用完整轨迹历史并鼓励广泛探索的新方法。

Method: HAEPO将轨迹压缩为累积对数似然，使用Plackett-Luce softmax获得与回报成正比的归一化权重，并加入熵正则化和软KL惩罚来稳定训练。

Result: 实验表明HAEPO收敛快、探索充分、与真实奖励对齐紧密，在多样化任务中表现优于或等同于PPO、GRPO和DPO。

Conclusion: HAEPO提供了一个稳定且可解释的框架，通过显式利用完整轨迹历史来平衡探索和稳定性。

Abstract: Exploration is essential in modern learning, from reinforcement learning
environments with small neural policies to large language models (LLMs).
Existing work, such as DPO, leverages full sequence log-likelihoods to capture
an entire trajectory of the model's decisions, while methods like GRPO
aggregate per-token ratios into a trajectory-level update. However, both often
limit exploration on long-horizon tasks. We introduce History-Aggregated
Exploratory Policy Optimization (HAEPO), a history-aware exploratory loss to
combat these shortcomings. HAEPO compresses each trajectory into the sum of its
logarithmic probabilities (a cumulative logarithmic likelihood), and applies a
Plackett-Luce softmax across trajectories to obtain normalized weights
proportional to their returns, thus encouraging broader exploration. We add
entropy regularization to stabilize the aggressive updates to prevent premature
collapse and a soft KL penalty relative to a frozen copy of the previous
(reference) policy. Empirically, HAEPO converges fast, explores thoroughly,
aligns closely with true rewards, and demonstrates robust learning behavior
better or at par with PPO, GRPO, and DPO across diverse tasks. Thus, HAEPO
provides a stable and interpretable framework by explicitly leveraging
full-trajectory history while balancing exploration and stability.

Abstract: Modern time series analysis demands frameworks that are flexible, efficient,
and extensible. However, many existing Python libraries exhibit limitations in
modularity and in their native support for irregular, multi-source, or sparse
data. We introduce pyFAST, a research-oriented PyTorch framework that
explicitly decouples data processing from model computation, fostering a
cleaner separation of concerns and facilitating rapid experimentation. Its data
engine is engineered for complex scenarios, supporting multi-source loading,
protein sequence handling, efficient sequence- and patch-level padding, dynamic
normalization, and mask-based modeling for both imputation and forecasting.
pyFAST integrates LLM-inspired architectures for the alignment-free fusion of
sparse data sources and offers native sparse metrics, specialized loss
functions, and flexible exogenous data fusion. Training utilities include
batch-based streaming aggregation for evaluation and device synergy to maximize
computational efficiency. A comprehensive suite of classical and deep learning
models (Linears, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, and GNNs) is provided within a
modular architecture that encourages extension. Released under the MIT license
at GitHub, pyFAST provides a compact yet powerful platform for advancing time
series research and applications.

*Aishwarya Venkataramanan,Joachim Denzler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DNP通过结合全局和距离感知的局部潜在结构来改进神经过程的不确定性估计，解决了标准NPs在不确定性校准和局部依赖捕捉方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准神经过程(NPs)依赖全局潜在变量，在不确定性校准和捕捉局部数据依赖方面存在困难，需要改进这些局限性。

Method: 引入全局潜在变量建模任务级变化，局部潜在变量在距离保持潜在空间中捕捉输入相似性，通过bi-Lipschitz正则化约束输入关系扭曲并保持相对距离。

Result: DNP在回归和分类任务中实现了强大的预测性能和改进的不确定性校准，能更有效地区分分布内和分布外数据。

Conclusion: 距离感知神经过程(DNP)通过结合全局和局部潜在结构，显著改善了不确定性估计能力，为神经过程家族提供了更可靠的校准性能。

Abstract: We propose the Distance-informed Neural Process (DNP), a novel variant of
Neural Processes that improves uncertainty estimation by combining global and
distance-aware local latent structures. Standard Neural Processes (NPs) often
rely on a global latent variable and struggle with uncertainty calibration and
capturing local data dependencies. DNP addresses these limitations by
introducing a global latent variable to model task-level variations and a local
latent variable to capture input similarity within a distance-preserving latent
space. This is achieved through bi-Lipschitz regularization, which bounds
distortions in input relationships and encourages the preservation of relative
distances in the latent space. This modeling approach allows DNP to produce
better-calibrated uncertainty estimates and more effectively distinguish in-
from out-of-distribution data. Empirical results demonstrate that DNP achieves
strong predictive performance and improved uncertainty calibration across
regression and classification tasks.

Conclusion: 这是首次为具有一般非线性动态函数的神经ODE推导出泛化界，为这类连续深度架构模型的泛化性能提供了理论保证

Abstract: Neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) are a popular type of
deep learning model that operate with continuous-depth architectures. To assess
how well such models perform on unseen data, it is crucial to understand their
generalization error bounds. Previous research primarily focused on the linear
case for the dynamics function in neural ODEs - Marion, P. (2023), or provided
bounds for Neural Controlled ODEs that depend on the sampling interval
Bleistein et al. (2023). In this work, we analyze a broader class of neural
ODEs where the dynamics function is a general nonlinear function, either time
dependent or time independent, and is Lipschitz continuous with respect to the
state variables. We showed that under this Lipschitz condition, the solutions
to neural ODEs have solutions with bounded variations. Based on this
observation, we establish generalization bounds for both time-dependent and
time-independent cases and investigate how overparameterization and domain
constraints influence these bounds. To our knowledge, this is the first
derivation of generalization bounds for neural ODEs with general nonlinear
dynamics.

Abstract: Temporal modeling in complex systems requires capturing dependencies across
multiple time scales while managing inherent uncertainties. We propose
HierCVAE, a novel architecture that integrates hierarchical attention
mechanisms with conditional variational autoencoders to address these

superior uncertainty calibration compared to state-of-the-art methods,
excelling in long-term forecasting and complex multi-variate dependencies.

Motivation: 分子结构生成是分子对接、蛋白质折叠和分子设计等生物应用中的基础问题。现有生成模型如扩散模型和流匹配已取得进展，但需要从能量角度改进训练和推理过程。

Method: 采用基于能量的视角，构建由深度网络表示的映射函数，直接学习从源分布（随机配置）到数据流形（目标结构）的迭代映射，形成概念简单且理论合理的流匹配设置。

Abstract: Molecular structure generation is a fundamental problem that involves
determining the 3D positions of molecules' constituents. It has crucial
biological applications, such as molecular docking, protein folding, and
molecular design. Recent advances in generative modeling, such as diffusion
models and flow matching, have made great progress on these tasks by modeling
molecular conformations as a distribution. In this work, we focus on flow
matching and adopt an energy-based perspective to improve training and
inference of structure generation models. Our view results in a mapping
function, represented by a deep network, that is directly learned to
\textit{iteratively} map random configurations, i.e. samples from the source
distribution, to target structures, i.e. points in the data manifold. This
yields a conceptually simple and empirically effective flow matching setup that
is theoretically justified and has interesting connections to fundamental
properties such as idempotency and stability, as well as the empirically useful
techniques such as structure refinement in AlphaFold. Experiments on protein
docking as well as protein backbone generation consistently demonstrate the
method's effectiveness, where it outperforms recent baselines of
task-associated flow matching and diffusion models, using a similar
computational budget.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多标签数据应该在应用多标签模型前分析标签依赖性，但标签独立性无法直接从标签值测量，需要通过条件协方差来评估

Method: 比较三种模型（多元Probit、多元Bernoulli和阶段Logit）在估计常数协方差和依赖协方差方面的性能，设计实验观察每个模型对条件协方差的测量

Result: 所有模型都能根据协方差强度同等效地测量常数和依赖协方差，但都会在存在常数协方差时误检测到依赖协方差，多元Probit模型的错误率最低

Conclusion: 多元Probit模型在估计多标签条件协方差方面表现最优，是分析标签依赖性的最佳选择

Abstract: Multilabel data should be analysed for label dependence before applying
multilabel models. Independence between multilabel data labels cannot be
measured directly from the label values due to their dependence on the set of
covariates $\vec{x}$, but can be measured by examining the conditional label
covariance using a multivariate Probit model. Unfortunately, the multivariate
Probit model provides an estimate of its copula covariance, and so might not be
reliable in estimating constant covariance and dependent covariance. In this
article, we compare three models (Multivariate Probit, Multivariate Bernoulli
and Staged Logit) for estimating the constant and dependent multilabel
conditional label covariance. We provide an experiment that allows us to
observe each model's measurement of conditional covariance. We found that all
models measure constant and dependent covariance equally well, depending on the
strength of the covariance, but the models all falsely detect that dependent
covariance is present for data where constant covariance is present. Of the
three models, the Multivariate Probit model had the lowest error rate.

Motivation: 研究Koopman表示在混沌动力系统中的泛化能力，探索其在多任务学习中的潜力，特别是在预测和控制任务之间的可迁移性。

Method: 提出三阶段方法：1）通过自编码学习Koopman嵌入；2）在下一状态预测任务上预训练transformer模型；3）针对安全关键控制任务进行微调。使用Lorenz系统作为测试平台。

Result: Koopman嵌入在准确性和数据效率方面均优于标准和物理信息PCA基线。在微调过程中固定预训练transformer权重不会导致性能下降，表明学习到的表示捕获了可重用的动力学结构而非任务特定模式。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持将Koopman嵌入作为物理信息机器学习中多任务学习的基础表示方法，证明了其在捕获可重用动力学结构方面的有效性。

Abstract: This paper investigates the generalisability of Koopman-based representations
for chaotic dynamical systems, focusing on their transferability across
prediction and control tasks. Using the Lorenz system as a testbed, we propose
a three-stage methodology: learning Koopman embeddings through autoencoding,
pre-training a transformer on next-state prediction, and fine-tuning for
safety-critical control. Our results show that Koopman embeddings outperform
both standard and physics-informed PCA baselines, achieving accurate and
data-efficient performance. Notably, fixing the pre-trained transformer weights
during fine-tuning leads to no performance degradation, indicating that the
learned representations capture reusable dynamical structure rather than
task-specific patterns. These findings support the use of Koopman embeddings as
a foundation for multi-task learning in physics-informed machine learning. A

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PAX-TS是一种模型无关的后处理算法，用于解释时间序列预测模型及其预测结果，通过局部输入扰动提供多粒度解释，并能表征多元时间序列的跨通道相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列预测模型普遍不透明，缺乏对其预测结果的解释能力，而现有的后处理可解释性方法（如LIME）不适用于预测场景，因此需要开发专门的时间序列预测可解释性方法。

Method: 基于局部输入扰动的模型无关后处理算法，通过扰动输入时间序列来生成多粒度解释，能够处理多元时间序列的跨通道相关性分析。

Result: 在7种算法和10个不同数据集上的基准测试表明，PAX-TS能有效捕捉模型行为，高性能和低性能算法的解释存在明显差异，并识别出6类跨数据集和算法重复出现的模式，这些模式是性能的指标。

Conclusion: PAX-TS能够以不同详细程度说明时间序列预测模型的机制，其解释可用于回答关于预测的实际问题，为时间序列预测提供了有效的可解释性工具。

Abstract: Time series forecasting has seen considerable improvement during the last
years, with transformer models and large language models driving advancements
of the state of the art. Modern forecasting models are generally opaque and do
not provide explanations for their forecasts, while well-known post-hoc
explainability methods like LIME are not suitable for the forecasting context.
We propose PAX-TS, a model-agnostic post-hoc algorithm to explain time series
forecasting models and their forecasts. Our method is based on localized input
perturbations and results in multi-granular explanations. Further, it is able
to characterize cross-channel correlations for multivariate time series
forecasts. We clearly outline the algorithmic procedure behind PAX-TS,
demonstrate it on a benchmark with 7 algorithms and 10 diverse datasets,
compare it with two other state-of-the-art explanation algorithms, and present
the different explanation types of the method. We found that the explanations
of high-performing and low-performing algorithms differ on the same datasets,
highlighting that the explanations of PAX-TS effectively capture a model's
behavior. Based on time step correlation matrices resulting from the benchmark,
we identify 6 classes of patterns that repeatedly occur across different
datasets and algorithms. We found that the patterns are indicators of
performance, with noticeable differences in forecasting error between the
classes. Lastly, we outline a multivariate example where PAX-TS demonstrates
how the forecasting model takes cross-channel correlations into account. With
PAX-TS, time series forecasting models' mechanisms can be illustrated in
different levels of detail, and its explanations can be used to answer
practical questions on forecasts.

Conclusion: FedProtoKD通过改进的原型聚合和知识蒸馏机制有效解决了异构联邦学习中的原型边缘收缩问题，为HFL研究提供了新的发展方向。

Abstract: Heterogeneous Federated Learning (HFL) has gained attention for its ability
to accommodate diverse models and heterogeneous data across clients.
Prototype-based HFL methods emerge as a promising solution to address
statistical heterogeneity and privacy challenges, paving the way for new
advancements in HFL research. This method focuses on sharing only
class-representative prototypes among heterogeneous clients. However, these
prototypes are often aggregated on the server using weighted averaging, leading
to sub-optimal global knowledge; these cause the shrinking of aggregated
prototypes, which negatively affects the model performance in scenarios when
models are heterogeneous and data distributions are extremely non-IID. We
propose FedProtoKD in a Heterogeneous Federated Learning setting, using an
enhanced dual-knowledge distillation mechanism to improve the system
performance with clients' logits and prototype feature representation. We aim
to resolve the prototype margin-shrinking problem using a contrastive
learning-based trainable server prototype by leveraging a class-wise adaptive
prototype margin. Furthermore, we assess the importance of public samples using
the closeness of the sample's prototype to its class representative prototypes,
which enhances learning performance. FedProtoKD achieved average improvements
of 1.13% up to 34.13% accuracy across various settings and significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art HFL methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STDiff是一种基于条件去噪扩散模型的工业时间序列缺失值填补方法，通过逐步生成缺失值并考虑系统动态和控制输入，在长缺失块情况下表现优于传统窗口方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法将缺失值填补视为固定时间窗口内的模式完成任务，这在工业系统中往往失效，因为工业系统动态受控制动作驱动、高度非平稳且可能存在长时间连续缺失

Method: 使用条件去噪扩散模型，具有与控制理论一致的自回归偏置，基于最近已知状态和相关控制或环境输入逐步生成缺失值

Result: 在模拟缺失块的公共污水处理数据集上，STDiff始终实现最低误差，且在更长缺失块时优势更明显；在真实工业数据集上，产生动态合理的轨迹，而基于窗口的模型往往趋于平坦或过度平滑

Conclusion: 支持动态感知、显式条件化的填补方法作为工业时间序列的稳健方法，并讨论了计算权衡和向更广泛领域的扩展

Abstract: Most deep learning methods for imputing missing values treat the task as
completing patterns within a fixed time window. This assumption often fails in
industrial systems, where dynamics are driven by control actions, are highly
non-stationary, and can experience long, uninterrupted gaps. We propose STDiff,
which reframes imputation as learning how the system evolves from one state to
the next. STDiff uses a conditional denoising diffusion model with a causal
bias aligned to control theory, generating missing values step-by-step based on
the most recent known state and relevant control or environmental inputs. On a
public wastewater treatment dataset with simulated missing blocks, STDiff
consistently achieves the lowest errors, with its advantage increasing for
longer gaps. On a raw industrial dataset with substantial real gaps, it
produces trajectories that remain dynamically plausible, in contrast to
window-based models that tend to flatten or over-smooth. These results support
dynamics-aware, explicitly conditioned imputation as a robust approach for
industrial time series, and we discuss computational trade-offs and extensions
to broader domains.

Method: 使用杆件模拟分段线性近似，用弹簧势能编码均方误差损失函数，通过耗散过程收敛到最小能量配置，构建物理仿真系统进行回归任务。

Result: 系统性能与多层感知器相当，发现了热力学学习障碍现象：当系统自由能变化达到某个障碍时，由于环境波动而无法学习。

Conclusion: 这种简单物理模型有助于从物理角度更好地理解学习系统，揭示了学习过程中的热力学限制和自由能变化与学习能力之间的关系。

Abstract: Learning is a physical process. Here, we aim to study a simple dynamical
system composed of springs and sticks capable of arbitrarily approximating any
continuous function. The main idea of our work is to use the sticks to mimic a
piecewise-linear approximation of the given function, use the potential energy
of springs to encode a desired mean squared error loss function, and converge
to a minimum-energy configuration via dissipation. We apply the proposed
simulation system to regression tasks and show that its performance is
comparable to that of multi-layer perceptrons. In addition, we study the
thermodynamic properties of the system and find a relation between the free
energy change of the system and its ability to learn an underlying data
distribution. We empirically find a \emph{thermodynamic learning barrier} for
the system caused by the fluctuations of the environment, whereby the system
cannot learn if its change in free energy hits such a barrier. We believe this
simple model can help us better understand learning systems from a physical
point of view.

Method: 在四个实际数据集上评估四种预测模型（LightGBM、Transformer、随机森林等）和三种编码策略（包括2-gram活动迁移编码和组合编码等）的表现。

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) aims to train models that forecast
upcoming events in process executions. These predictions support early
bottleneck detection, improved scheduling, proactive interventions, and timely
communication with stakeholders. While existing research adopts a control-flow
perspective, we investigate next-activity prediction from a resource-centric
viewpoint, which offers additional benefits such as improved work organization,
workload balancing, and capacity forecasting. Although resource information has
been shown to enhance tasks such as process performance analysis, its role in
next-activity prediction remains unexplored. In this study, we evaluate four
prediction models and three encoding strategies across four real-life datasets.
Compared to the baseline, our results show that LightGBM and Transformer models
perform best with an encoding based on 2-gram activity transitions, while
Random Forest benefits most from an encoding that combines 2-gram transitions
and activity repetition features. This combined encoding also achieves the
highest average accuracy. This resource-centric approach could enable smarter
resource allocation, strategic workforce planning, and personalized employee
support by analyzing individual behavior rather than case-level progression.
The findings underscore the potential of resource-centric next-activity
prediction, opening up new venues for research on PPM.

Conclusion: 该方法可利用全部数据进行训练，计算开销小，特别适合数据有限场景如迁移学习，可作为梯度下降库的可选功能

Abstract: Machine learning models are often learned by minimising a loss function on
the training data using a gradient descent algorithm. These models often suffer
from overfitting, leading to a decline in predictive performance on unseen
data. A standard solution is early stopping using a hold-out validation set,
which halts the minimisation when the validation loss stops decreasing.
However, this hold-out set reduces the data available for training. This paper
presents {\sc gradstop}, a novel stochastic early stopping method that only
uses information in the gradients, which are produced by the gradient descent
algorithm ``for free.'' Our main contributions are that we estimate the
Bayesian posterior by the gradient information, define the early stopping
problem as drawing sample from this posterior, and use the approximated
posterior to obtain a stopping criterion. Our empirical evaluation shows that
{\sc gradstop} achieves a small loss on test data and compares favourably to a
validation-set-based stopping criterion. By leveraging the entire dataset for
training, our method is particularly advantageous in data-limited settings,
such as transfer learning. It can be incorporated as an optional feature in
gradient descent libraries with only a small computational overhead. The source
code is available at https://github.com/edahelsinki/gradstop.

Motivation: 尽管现代循环模型具有次二次复杂度优势，但最近研究发现它们在推理和记忆任务上可能不如Transformer。本文通过联想回忆净化式测试，深入探索这些模型的表现差异和训练问题。

Method: 使用联想回忆(AR)净化式测试，系统性分析学习率对现代循环模型性能的影响，研究网络深度与宽度扩缩的对比效果，以及通过结构剪除实验分析Transformer和Mamba模型的组件影响。

Conclusion: 现代循环模型在训练稳定性方面需要进一步研究，网络结构扩缩策略应根据模型类型调整，单层Transformer的训练动态为研究推理机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Despite the advantageous subquadratic complexity of modern recurrent deep
learning models -- such as state-space models (SSMs) -- recent studies have
highlighted their potential shortcomings compared to transformers on reasoning
and memorization tasks. In this paper, we dive deeper into one of such
benchmarks: associative recall (AR), which has been shown to correlate well
with language modeling performance, and inspect in detail the effects of
scaling and optimization issues in recently proposed token mixing strategies.
We first demonstrate that, unlike standard transformers, the choice of learning
rate plays a critical role in the performance of modern recurrent models: an
issue that can severely affect reported performance in previous works and
suggests further research is needed to stabilize training. Next, we show that
recurrent and attention-based models exhibit contrasting benefits when scaling
in width as opposed to depth, with attention being notably unable to solve AR
when limited to a single layer. We then further inspect 1-layer transformers,
revealing that despite their poor performance, their training dynamics
surprisingly resemble the formation of induction heads, a phenomenon previously
observed only in their 2-layer counterparts. Finally, through architectural
ablations, we study how components affects Transformer and Mamba's performance

TL;DR: 通过透明的机器学习架构和HazBinLoss函数，解决传统地震波动预测模型的黑盒问题和数据不平衡问题，提高模型可解释性和对严重地震场景的预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习地震波动模型(GMMs)存在两大问题：黑盒特性导致模型难以解释和信任，以及数据不平衡(近断层大地震记录少于远场小地震记录)导致对最严重损坏场景预测不足。

Method: 设计透明的ML架构，每个输入变量(震级、距离等)独立处理并线性相加得到输出，确保每个因子的贡献可解释。使用HazBinLoss函负函数，在训练中给严重的近场大震级记录赋予更高权重，减少远场小震级记录的影响。

Result: 模型能够抓取已知的地震学原理，与现有GMMs相比具有相似的表现性能，同时保持了透明性。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种可解释的机器学习方法，能够更广泛地应用于风险评估和灾害规划研究，解决了黑盒模型在高风险决策中的使用限制。

Abstract: Ground motion models (GMMs) predict how strongly the ground will shake during
an earthquake. They are essential for structural analysis, seismic design, and
seismic risk assessment studies. Traditional machine learning (ML) approaches
are popular to develop GMMs, due to large earthquake databases worldwide.
However, they operate as "black boxes," which are hard to interpret and trust,
limiting their use in high-stake decisions. Additionally, these databases
suffer from significant data imbalances: fewer large, critically damaging
records near the fault compared to abundant, less severely damaging distant
records. These two limitations are addressed in this work by developing a
transparent ML architecture using the HazBinLoss function. Each input (e.g.,
magnitude, distance, their interaction term, etc.) is processed separately and
added linearly to obtain the output, resulting in exact contribution of each
term. The HazBinLoss function assigns higher weights to critical near-field
large magnitude records and lower weights to less-critical far-field smaller
magnitude records, during training to prevent underprediction of the most
damaging scenarios. Our model captures known seismological principles and
achieves comparable performance with established GMMs while maintaining
transparency. This framework enables broader adoption of ML-based approaches
for risk assessment studies and disaster planning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索GNN在传统近似作用之外的能力，验证其能否超越训练域进行外推并生成数值格式。

Method: 使用符号回归结合GNN，在双节点图数据集上训练，通过残差损失实现无监督学习，并扩展到高阶格式。

Result: GNN能够重新发现标准一阶有限体积格式，实现二阶校正项和中点格式，误差为O(ε)。

Conclusion: GNN不仅是强大的近似器，还能作为开发新型数值方法的主动贡献者，推动了科学计算的新范式。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have deeply modified the landscape of numerical
simulations by demonstrating strong capabilities in approximating solutions of
physical systems. However, their ability to extrapolate beyond their training
domain (\textit{e.g.} larger or structurally different graphs) remains
uncertain. In this work, we establish that GNNs can serve purposes beyond their
traditional role, and be exploited to generate numerical schemes, in
conjunction with symbolic regression. First, we show numerically and
theoretically that a GNN trained on a dataset consisting solely of two-node
graphs can extrapolate a first-order Finite Volume (FV) scheme for the heat
equation on out-of-distribution, unstructured meshes. Specifically, if a GNN
achieves a loss $\varepsilon$ on such a dataset, it implements the FV scheme
with an error of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$. Using symbolic regression, we show
that the network effectively rediscovers the exact analytical formulation of
the standard first-order FV scheme. We then extend this approach to an
unsupervised context: the GNN recovers the first-order FV scheme using only a
residual loss similar to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with no
access to ground-truth data. Finally, we push the methodology further by
considering higher-order schemes: we train (i) a 2-hop and (ii) a 2-layers GNN
using the same PINN loss, that autonomously discover (i) a second-order
correction term to the initial scheme using a 2-hop stencil, and (ii) the
classic second-order midpoint scheme. These findings follows a recent paradigm
in scientific computing: GNNs are not only strong approximators, but can be
active contributors to the development of novel numerical methods.

TL;DR: 基于信息论的联邦忘印框架，通过二阶海森矩阵识别和重置敏感参数，实现高效数据删除和模型修复


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐私法规要求从深度学习模型中删除数据，而联邦学习中数据保留在客户端，使得全重训练或协调更新很难实现

Method: 使用二阶海森矩阵信息识别并选择性重置对要忘印数据最敏感的参数，然后进行最小化联邦重训练

Result: 在标准数据集上展示了强大隐私保护（MIA攻击成功率接近随机，类别知识被消除）和高性能（对比重训练基准的标准化准确率约为0.9）

Conclusion: 该框架为联邦学习中的数据忘印提供了一种实用解决方案，能够有效中和目标后门攻击，恢复模型完整性

Abstract: Privacy regulations require the erasure of data from deep learning models.
This is a significant challenge that is amplified in Federated Learning, where
data remains on clients, making full retraining or coordinated updates often
infeasible. This work introduces an efficient Federated Unlearning framework
based on information theory, modeling leakage as a parameter estimation
problem. Our method uses second-order Hessian information to identify and
selectively reset only the parameters most sensitive to the data being
forgotten, followed by minimal federated retraining. This model-agnostic
approach supports categorical and client unlearning without requiring server
access to raw client data after initial information aggregation. Evaluations on
benchmark datasets demonstrate strong privacy (MIA success near random,
categorical knowledge erased) and high performance (Normalized Accuracy against
re-trained benchmarks of $\approx$ 0.9), while aiming for increased efficiency
over complete retraining. Furthermore, in a targeted backdoor attack scenario,
our framework effectively neutralizes the malicious trigger, restoring model
integrity. This offers a practical solution for data forgetting in FL.

Motivation: 图神经网络(GNN)的性能受到图拓扑固有问题的限制，特别是信息过压缩(oversquashing)和过平滑(oversmoothing)问题。现有的图重布线方法旨在通过修改图拓扑来改善信息传播效果。

Method: TRIGON框架通过联合优化三角形选择和下游分类性能，从多个图视图中学习选择相关三角形，构建非平面三角剖分来重布线图结构。

Result: 实验结果表明，TRIGON在节点分类任务上优于现有最先进方法，在多种同质性和异质性基准测试中都表现出色，产生的重布线图具有更小的直径、更大的谱间隙和更低的有效电阻。

Conclusion: TRIGON通过创新的三角剖分方法有效改善了图拓扑结构，为GNN性能提升提供了新的解决方案，在解决信息传播瓶颈问题上展现出显著优势。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the leading paradigm for
learning over graph-structured data. However, their performance is limited by
issues inherent to graph topology, most notably oversquashing and
oversmoothing. Recent advances in graph rewiring aim to mitigate these
limitations by modifying the graph topology to promote more effective
information propagation. In this work, we introduce TRIGON, a novel framework
that constructs enriched, non-planar triangulations by learning to select
relevant triangles from multiple graph views. By jointly optimizing triangle
selection and downstream classification performance, our method produces a
rewired graph with markedly improved structural properties such as reduced
diameter, increased spectral gap, and lower effective resistance compared to
existing rewiring methods. Empirical results demonstrate that TRIGON
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on node classification tasks across a
range of homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks.

TL;DR: APT-LLM是一个针对任意精度大语言模型推理的全面加速方案，通过新型数据格式、矩阵乘法优化、内存管理和内核映射方法，在GPU上实现了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的计算需求巨大，限制了部署和实时性能。现有量化方法在GPU上支持任意精度超低位量化时面临Tensor Core支持有限、内存管理低效和内核优化不灵活等挑战。

Method: 提出APT-LLM方案：1）双极INT数据格式实现高效无损转换和并行计算；2）位级矩阵分解重组实现任意精度矩阵乘法；3）基于数据恢复的内存管理系统优化共享内存使用；4）动态内核映射方法选择最优超参数。

Result: 在LLM推理中，APT-LLM在RTX 3090上相比FP16基线实现3.99倍加速，比NVIDIA CUTLASS INT4快2.16倍；在RTX 4090和H800上分别实现2.44倍和1.65倍加速。

Conclusion: APT-LLM通过系统性的硬件优化方法，有效解决了任意精度LLM在GPU上的加速挑战，为超低位量化模型的部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, yet their
enormous computational demands severely limit deployment and real-time
performance. Quantization methods can help reduce computational costs, however,
attaining the extreme efficiency associated with ultra-low-bit quantized LLMs
at arbitrary precision presents challenges on GPUs. This is primarily due to
the limited support for GPU Tensor Cores, inefficient memory management, and
inflexible kernel optimizations. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
comprehensive acceleration scheme for arbitrary precision LLMs, namely APT-LLM.
Firstly, we introduce a novel data format, bipolar-INT, which allows for
efficient and lossless conversion with signed INT, while also being more
conducive to parallel computation. We also develop a matrix multiplication
(MatMul) method allowing for arbitrary precision by dismantling and
reassembling matrices at the bit level. This method provides flexible precision
and optimizes the utilization of GPU Tensor Cores. In addition, we propose a
memory management system focused on data recovery, which strategically employs
fast shared memory to substantially increase kernel execution speed and reduce
memory access latency. Finally, we develop a kernel mapping method that
dynamically selects the optimal configurable hyperparameters of kernels for
varying matrix sizes, enabling optimal performance across different LLM
architectures and precision settings. In LLM inference, APT-LLM achieves up to
a 3.99$\times$ speedup compared to FP16 baselines and a 2.16$\times$ speedup
over NVIDIA CUTLASS INT4 acceleration on RTX 3090. On RTX 4090 and H800,
APT-LLM achieves up to 2.44$\times$ speedup over FP16 and 1.65$\times$ speedup
over CUTLASS integer baselines.

Conclusion: 提出的约束优化框架成功解决了扩散模型多目标对齐和组合中的权衡问题，为生成具有多个期望属性的样本提供了理论保证和实用算法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have become prevalent in generative modeling due to their
ability to sample from complex distributions. To improve the quality of
generated samples and their compliance with user requirements, two commonly
used methods are: (i) Alignment, which involves fine-tuning a diffusion model
to align it with a reward; and (ii) Composition, which combines several
pre-trained diffusion models, each emphasizing a desirable attribute in the
generated outputs. However, trade-offs often arise when optimizing for multiple
rewards or combining multiple models, as they can often represent competing
properties. Existing methods cannot guarantee that the resulting model
faithfully generates samples with all the desired properties. To address this
gap, we propose a constrained optimization framework that unifies alignment and
composition of diffusion models by enforcing that the aligned model satisfies
reward constraints and/or remains close to (potentially multiple) pre-trained
models. We provide a theoretical characterization of the solutions to the
constrained alignment and composition problems and develop a Lagrangian-based
primal-dual training algorithm to approximate these solutions. Empirically, we
demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our proposed approach in image
generation, applying it to alignment and composition, and show that our aligned
or composed model satisfies constraints effectively, and improves on the
equally-weighted approach. Our implementation can be found at

Conclusion: 通过结合概率群众建模和主动学习，能够有效处理噪声多注释者反馈，提高偏好基于强化学习的效果。

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning has gained prominence as a strategy
for training agents in environments where the reward signal is difficult to
specify or misaligned with human intent. However, its effectiveness is often
limited by the high cost and low availability of reliable human input,
especially in domains where expert feedback is scarce or errors are costly. To
address this, we propose a novel framework that combines two complementary
strategies: probabilistic crowd modelling to handle noisy, multi-annotator
feedback, and active learning to prioritize feedback on the most informative
agent actions. We extend the Advise algorithm to support multiple trainers,
estimate their reliability online, and incorporate entropy-based query
selection to guide feedback requests. We evaluate our approach in a set of
environments that span both synthetic and real-world-inspired settings,
including 2D games (Taxi, Pacman, Frozen Lake) and a blood glucose control task
for Type 1 Diabetes using the clinically approved UVA/Padova simulator. Our
preliminary results demonstrate that agents trained with feedback on uncertain
trajectories exhibit faster learning in most tasks, and we outperform the
baselines for the blood glucose control task.

Conclusion: 该研究为密集关联记忆模型提供了理论基础和实用训练方法，通过统计力学分析和鞍点层次结构的利用，实现了更稳定和高效的学习过程。

Abstract: Dense associative memory (DAM) models have been attracting renewed attention
since they were shown to be robust to adversarial examples and closely related
to state-of-the-art machine learning paradigms, such as the attention
mechanisms in transformers and generative diffusion models. We study a DAM
built upon a three-layer Boltzmann machine with Potts hidden units, which
represent data clusters and classes. Through a statistical mechanics analysis,
we derive saddle-point equations that characterize both the stationary points
of DAMs trained on real data and the fixed points of DAMs trained on synthetic
data within a teacher-student framework. Based on these results, we propose a
novel regularization scheme that makes training significantly more stable.
Moreover, we show empirically that our DAM learns interpretable solutions to
both supervised and unsupervised classification problems. Pushing our
theoretical analysis further, we find that the weights learned by relatively
small DAMs correspond to unstable saddle points in larger DAMs. We implement a
network-growing algorithm that leverages this saddle-point hierarchy to
drastically reduce the computational cost of training dense associative memory.

Abstract: In safety-critical deep learning applications, robustness measures the
ability of neural models that handle imperceptible perturbations in input data,
which may lead to potential safety hazards. Existing pre-deployment robustness
assessment methods typically suffer from significant trade-offs between
computational cost and measurement precision, limiting their practical utility.
To address these limitations, this paper conducts a comprehensive comparative
analysis of existing robustness definitions and associated assessment
methodologies. We propose tower robustness to evaluate robustness, which is a
novel, practical metric based on hypothesis testing to quantitatively evaluate
probabilistic robustness, enabling more rigorous and efficient pre-deployment
assessments. Our extensive comparative evaluation illustrates the advantages
and applicability of our proposed approach, thereby advancing the systematic
understanding and enhancement of model robustness in safety-critical deep
learning applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有连续情感识别方法要么忽略情感的模糊性，要么将模糊性视为独立且静态的时间变量，无法有效处理情感固有的模糊性和动态特性。

Method: 引入模糊感知序数情感表示框架，通过情感变化率来建模情感模糊性，在RECOLA和GameVibe两个情感语料库上测试有界（唤醒度、效价）和无界（参与度）连续情感轨迹。

Result: 序数表示在无界标签上优于传统模糊感知模型，获得最高的CCC和SDA分数；在有界轨迹上，序数表示在SDA方面表现优异，显示出捕捉标注情感轨迹相对变化的卓越能力。

Conclusion: 模糊感知序数表示框架能够有效处理情感标注的模糊性和时间动态特性，特别是在捕捉情感轨迹的相对变化方面表现出色。

Abstract: Emotions are inherently ambiguous and dynamic phenomena, yet existing
continuous emotion recognition approaches either ignore their ambiguity or
treat ambiguity as an independent and static variable over time. Motivated by
this gap in the literature, in this paper we introduce \emph{ambiguity-aware
ordinal} emotion representations, a novel framework that captures both the
ambiguity present in emotion annotation and the inherent temporal dynamics of
emotional traces. Specifically, we propose approaches that model emotion
ambiguity through its rate of change. We evaluate our framework on two
affective corpora -- RECOLA and GameVibe -- testing our proposed approaches on
both bounded (arousal, valence) and unbounded (engagement) continuous traces.
Our results demonstrate that ordinal representations outperform conventional
ambiguity-aware models on unbounded labels, achieving the highest Concordance
Correlation Coefficient (CCC) and Signed Differential Agreement (SDA) scores,
highlighting their effectiveness in modeling the traces' dynamics. For bounded
traces, ordinal representations excel in SDA, revealing their superior ability
to capture relative changes of annotated emotion traces.

Motivation: 尽管工具集成的大语言模型展现出巨大潜力，但缺乏解释为何这种范式有效的理论框架。本文旨在填补这一空白，为TIR的成功提供首个原则性解释。

Method: 提出了优势塑造策略优化(ASPO)算法，直接修改优势函数来指导策略行为而不影响训练稳定性。在数学基准测试中使用Python解释器作为外部工具进行综合实验。

Result: TIR模型在pass@k指标上显著优于纯文本模型，优势不仅限于计算密集型问题，还延伸到需要抽象洞察力的问题。ASPO带来了更早的代码调用和更多交互轮次。

Conclusion: 工具集成推理从根本上扩展了LLM的能力边界，打破了纯文本模型的能力天花板。本文提供了TIR成功的理论解释，揭示了工具如何实现更强大的推理能力。

Abstract: We study why Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) makes Large Language Models
(LLMs) more capable. While LLMs integrated with tools like Python code
interpreters show great promise, a principled theory explaining why this
paradigm is effective has been missing. This work provides the first formal
proof that TIR fundamentally expands an LLM's capabilities. We demonstrate that
tools enable a strict expansion of the model's empirical and feasible support,
breaking the capability ceiling of pure-text models by unlocking
problem-solving strategies that are otherwise impossible or intractably
verbose. To guide model behavior without compromising training stability and
performance, we also introduce Advantage Shaping Policy Optimization (ASPO), a
novel algorithm that directly modifies the advantage function to guide the
policy behavior. We conduct comprehensive experiments on challenging
mathematical benchmarks, leveraging a Python interpreter as the external tool.
Our results show that the TIR model decisively outperforms its pure-text
counterpart on the pass@k metric. Crucially, this advantage is not confined to
computationally-intensive problems but extends to those requiring significant
abstract insight. We further identify the emergent cognitive patterns that
illustrate how models learn to think with tools. Finally, we report improved
tool usage behavior with early code invocation and much more interactive turns
with ASPO. Overall, our work provides the first principled explanation for
TIR's success, shifting the focus from the mere fact that tools work to why and
how they enable more powerful reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MTP作为辅助目标在语言模型训练中表现不一致，在标准NLP基准测试中表现不佳，因为精确预测未来token过于困难

Method: 提出Token Order Prediction (TOP)，使用学习排序损失训练模型按接近度对即将到来的token进行排序，相比MTP仅需单个额外的unembedding层

Result: 在340M、1.8B和7B参数规模的模型预训练中，TOP在8个标准NLP基准测试中整体优于NTP和MTP，即使在较大规模下也保持优势

Conclusion: TOP是一种有效的辅助训练目标，通过降低预测难度（从精确token预测改为顺序排序）来提升语言模型性能，计算开销更小且效果更好

Abstract: Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) has been proposed as an auxiliary objective to
improve next-token prediction (NTP) in language model training but shows
inconsistent improvements, underperforming in standard NLP benchmarks. We argue
that MTP's exact future token prediction is too difficult as an auxiliary loss.
Instead, we propose Token Order Prediction (TOP), which trains models to order
upcoming tokens by their proximity using a learning-to-rank loss. TOP requires
only a single additional unembedding layer compared to MTP's multiple
transformer layers. We pretrain models of 340M, 1.8B, and 7B parameters using
NTP, MTP, and TOP objectives. Results on eight standard NLP benchmarks show
that TOP overall outperforms both NTP and MTP even at scale. Our code is
