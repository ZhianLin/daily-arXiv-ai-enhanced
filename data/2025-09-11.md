Result: 实验结果表明HuMo在多个子任务上超越了专门的先进方法，建立了统一的多模态条件人类视频生成框架。

Conclusion: HuMo成功解决了多模态输入协调的挑战，通过创新的数据集构建、训练策略和推理方法，实现了高质量的人类中心视频生成，为多模态条件视频生成提供了统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Human-Centric Video Generation (HCVG) methods seek to synthesize human videos
from multimodal inputs, including text, image, and audio. Existing methods
struggle to effectively coordinate these heterogeneous modalities due to two
challenges: the scarcity of training data with paired triplet conditions and
the difficulty of collaborating the sub-tasks of subject preservation and
audio-visual sync with multimodal inputs. In this work, we present HuMo, a
unified HCVG framework for collaborative multimodal control. For the first
challenge, we construct a high-quality dataset with diverse and paired text,
reference images, and audio. For the second challenge, we propose a two-stage
progressive multimodal training paradigm with task-specific strategies. For the
subject preservation task, to maintain the prompt following and visual
generation abilities of the foundation model, we adopt the minimal-invasive
image injection strategy. For the audio-visual sync task, besides the commonly
adopted audio cross-attention layer, we propose a focus-by-predicting strategy
that implicitly guides the model to associate audio with facial regions. For
joint learning of controllabilities across multimodal inputs, building on
previously acquired capabilities, we progressively incorporate the audio-visual
sync task. During inference, for flexible and fine-grained multimodal control,
we design a time-adaptive Classifier-Free Guidance strategy that dynamically
adjusts guidance weights across denoising steps. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that HuMo surpasses specialized state-of-the-art methods in
sub-tasks, establishing a unified framework for collaborative
multimodal-conditioned HCVG. Project Page:

TL;DR: 这篇论文是关于3D和4D世界建模的首次全面综述，提出了标准化的定义和分类体系，系统总结了相关方法、数据集和评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注2D图像和视频的生成方法，忽视了基于原生3D/4D表示（如RGB-D图像、占据栅格、LiDAR点云）的大规模场景建模工作，且缺乏对"世界模型"的标准定义和分类体系。

Method: 建立了精确的定义，提出了结构化分类体系（视频生成VideoGen、占据生成OccGen、LiDAR生成LiDARGen），系统总结了3D/4D设置下的数据集和评估指标。

Result: 提供了首个专门针对3D和4D世界建模与生成的全面综述，为领域发展提供了连贯的基础参考框架。

Conclusion: 该综述填补了研究空白，建立了标准化框架，讨论了实际应用、开放挑战和未来研究方向，旨在推动3D/4D世界建模领域的发展。

Abstract: World modeling has become a cornerstone in AI research, enabling agents to
understand, represent, and predict the dynamic environments they inhabit. While
prior work largely emphasizes generative methods for 2D image and video data,
they overlook the rapidly growing body of work that leverages native 3D and 4D
representations such as RGB-D imagery, occupancy grids, and LiDAR point clouds
for large-scale scene modeling. At the same time, the absence of a standardized
definition and taxonomy for ``world models'' has led to fragmented and
sometimes inconsistent claims in the literature. This survey addresses these
gaps by presenting the first comprehensive review explicitly dedicated to 3D
and 4D world modeling and generation. We establish precise definitions,
introduce a structured taxonomy spanning video-based (VideoGen),
occupancy-based (OccGen), and LiDAR-based (LiDARGen) approaches, and
systematically summarize datasets and evaluation metrics tailored to 3D/4D
settings. We further discuss practical applications, identify open challenges,
and highlight promising research directions, aiming to provide a coherent and
foundational reference for advancing the field. A systematic summary of
existing literature is available at https://github.com/worldbench/survey

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XFloodNet是一个基于深度学习的城市洪水分类框架，通过多模态特征融合和分层注意力机制，在三个基准数据集上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统洪水检测方法依赖单模态数据和静态规则系统，无法捕捉洪水事件的动态非线性关系，现有注意力机制和集成学习方法在分层细化、跨模态特征集成和对噪声环境的适应性方面存在局限。

Method: 提出XFloodNet框架，包含三个核心组件：分层跨模态门控注意力机制、异构卷积自适应多尺度注意力模块、以及级联卷积变换器特征细化技术，实现视觉和文本特征的动态对齐和多粒度交互。

Result: 在Chennai Floods、Rhine18 Floods和Harz17 Floods三个数据集上分别达到93.33%、82.24%和88.60%的F1分数，显著超越现有方法。

Conclusion: XFloodNet通过创新的深度学习技术重新定义了城市洪水分类，解决了传统方法的局限性，在洪水检测性能上实现了显著提升。

Abstract: In an era of escalating climate change, urban flooding has emerged as a
critical challenge for sustainable cities, threatening lives, infrastructure,
and ecosystems. Traditional flood detection methods are constrained by their
reliance on unimodal data and static rule-based systems, which fail to capture
the dynamic, non-linear relationships inherent in flood events. Furthermore,
existing attention mechanisms and ensemble learning approaches exhibit
limitations in hierarchical refinement, cross-modal feature integration, and
adaptability to noisy or unstructured environments, resulting in suboptimal
flood classification performance. To address these challenges, we present
XFloodNet, a novel framework that redefines urban flood classification through
advanced deep-learning techniques. XFloodNet integrates three novel components:
(1) a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Gated Attention mechanism that dynamically
aligns visual and textual features, enabling precise multi-granularity
interactions and resolving contextual ambiguities; (2) a Heterogeneous
Convolutional Adaptive Multi-Scale Attention module, which leverages
frequency-enhanced channel attention and frequency-modulated spatial attention
to extract and prioritize discriminative flood-related features across spectral
and spatial domains; and (3) a Cascading Convolutional Transformer Feature
Refinement technique that harmonizes hierarchical features through adaptive
scaling and cascading operations, ensuring robust and noise-resistant flood
detection. We evaluate our proposed method on three benchmark datasets, such as
Chennai Floods, Rhine18 Floods, and Harz17 Floods, XFloodNet achieves
state-of-the-art F1-scores of 93.33%, 82.24%, and 88.60%, respectively,
surpassing existing methods by significant margins.

TL;DR: Video Parallel Scaling (VPS) 是一种推理时方法，通过并行处理视频帧子集来扩展视频大语言模型的感知带宽，避免长上下文带来的计算成本问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频大语言模型在处理更多输入帧以捕捉细粒度时间细节时面临计算成本过高和长上下文性能下降的问题

Method: 运行多个并行推理流，每个流处理视频帧的不同不相交子集，然后聚合这些互补流的输出概率

Result: 在多个模型架构和规模（2B-32B）上的实验显示，VPS 在 Video-MME 和 EventHallusion 等基准测试中持续显著提升性能

Conclusion: VPS 提供了一种内存高效且鲁棒的框架，可增强视频大语言模型的时间推理能力，比其他并行替代方案更具扩展优势

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) face a critical bottleneck:
increasing the number of input frames to capture fine-grained temporal detail
leads to prohibitive computational costs and performance degradation from long
context lengths. We introduce Video Parallel Scaling (VPS), an inference-time
method that expands a model's perceptual bandwidth without increasing its
context window. VPS operates by running multiple parallel inference streams,
each processing a unique, disjoint subset of the video's frames. By aggregating
the output probabilities from these complementary streams, VPS integrates a
richer set of visual information than is possible with a single pass. We
theoretically show that this approach effectively contracts the Chinchilla
scaling law by leveraging uncorrelated visual evidence, thereby improving
performance without additional training. Extensive experiments across various
model architectures and scales (2B-32B) on benchmarks such as Video-MME and
EventHallusion demonstrate that VPS consistently and significantly improves
performance. It scales more favorably than other parallel alternatives (e.g.
Self-consistency) and is complementary to other decoding strategies, offering a
memory-efficient and robust framework for enhancing the temporal reasoning
capabilities of VideoLLMs.

TL;DR: 多模态立场检测框架，结合文本和视觉信息，在气候变化数据集上超越现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有立场检测方法主要仅使用文本数据，而社交媒体内容越来越多地结合文本和视觉元素，需要充分利用多模态信息进行立场检测

Method: 采用层次融合方法，首先使用大语言模型提取文本摘要，用领域知识图片描述生成器解释视觉内容，然后通过专门的transformer模块共同建模文本和图像之间的交互关系

Result: 在MultiClimate数据集上达到准确率76.2%、精确度76.3%、召回率76.2%和F1得76.2%，表现超过现有最优方法

Conclusion: 该多模态融合框架能够有效利用文本和视觉信息进行立场检测，在气候变化相关主题上取得了显著的性能提升

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of information across digital platforms, stance
detection has emerged as a pivotal challenge in social media analysis. While
most of the existing approaches focus solely on textual data, real-world social
media content increasingly combines text with visual elements creating a need
for advanced multimodal methods. To address this gap, we propose a multimodal
stance detection framework that integrates textual and visual information
through a hierarchical fusion approach. Our method first employs a Large
Language Model to retrieve stance-relevant summaries from source text, while a
domain-aware image caption generator interprets visual content in the context
of the target topic. These modalities are then jointly modeled along with the
reply text, through a specialized transformer module that captures interactions
between the texts and images. The proposed modality fusion framework integrates
diverse modalities to facilitate robust stance classification. We evaluate our
approach on the MultiClimate dataset, a benchmark for climate change-related
stance detection containing aligned video frames and transcripts. We achieve
accuracy of 76.2%, precision of 76.3%, recall of 76.2% and F1-score of 76.2%,
respectively, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.

ResNet50, GoogLeNet) with five transfer classifiers (KNN, SVM, MLP, C4.5,
Na\"ive Bayes), resulting in 15 different base learners. These are aggregated
via weighted averaging to classify regions as Car, Van, Truck, Bus, or
background. Hyperparameters are optimized with the whale optimization algorithm
to balance accuracy, precision, and recall. Implemented in MATLAB R2020b with
parallel processing, SI-EDTL outperforms existing methods on the AU-AIR UAV
dataset.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提供了一个新的火星数字高程模型预测数据集MCTED，包含80,898个样本，并验证了小型U-Net模型在该数据集上的优秀表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决火星大规模DEM数据中存在的伪弊和数据缺失问题，为机器学习应用提供一个高质量的数据集。

Method: 使用火星报告轨道器CTX仪器收集的高分辨率正弄图像和DEM数据对，通过综合处理流程生成数据集，包含光学图像补丁、DEM补丁和掩码补丁，并进行训练/验证数据分割。

Result: 生成了包含80,898个样本的MCTED数据集，训练的小型U-Net模型在高程预测任务上超过了DepthAnythingV2基础模型的零样本性能。

Conclusion: MCTED数据集为火星DEM预测提供了高质量的机器学习资源，小型专门模型在该领域可以超过大型基础模型，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: This work presents a new dataset for the Martian digital elevation model
prediction task, ready for machine learning applications called MCTED. The
dataset has been generated using a comprehensive pipeline designed to process
high-resolution Mars orthoimage and DEM pairs from Day et al., yielding a
dataset consisting of 80,898 data samples. The source images are data gathered
by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter using the CTX instrument, providing a very
diverse and comprehensive coverage of the Martian surface. Given the complexity
of the processing pipelines used in large-scale DEMs, there are often artefacts
and missing data points in the original data, for which we developed tools to
solve or mitigate their impact. We divide the processed samples into training
and validation splits, ensuring samples in both splits cover no mutual areas to
avoid data leakage. Every sample in the dataset is represented by the optical
image patch, DEM patch, and two mask patches, indicating values that were
originally missing or were altered by us. This allows future users of the
dataset to handle altered elevation regions as they please. We provide
statistical insights of the generated dataset, including the spatial
distribution of samples, the distributions of elevation values, slopes and
more. Finally, we train a small U-Net architecture on the MCTED dataset and
compare its performance to a monocular depth estimation foundation model,
DepthAnythingV2, on the task of elevation prediction. We find that even a very
small architecture trained on this dataset specifically, beats a zero-shot
performance of a depth estimation foundation model like DepthAnythingV2. We
make the dataset and code used for its generation completely open source in
public repositories.

*Sasan Sharifipour,Constantino Álvarez Casado,Mohammad Sabokrou,Miguel Bordallo López*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出APML损失函数，通过可微分的Sinkhorn迭代实现点云预测任务中的一对一匹配，解决了传统损失函数的多对一对应问题，在保持接近二次时间复杂度的情况下获得更好的空间分布性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统点云预测损失函数（如CD、HyperCD、InfoCD）存在多对一对应问题，导致密集区域点拥堵和稀疏区域覆盖不足；EMD虽然能实现一对一匹配但计算复杂度太高。需要一种既保持一对一匹配优势又具有实用计算效率的可微分损失函数。

Method: 基于Sinkhorn迭代在温度缩放相似度矩阵上进行概率匹配，通过分析计算温度参数保证最小分配概率，避免手动调参。实现了完全可微分的近似一对一匹配，时间复杂度接近二次。

Result: 在ShapeNet基准测试和WiFi CSI到3D人体点云生成任务中，APML损失函数实现了更快的收敛速度、更好的空间分布（特别是在低密度区域），定量性能相当或更优，且无需额外超参数搜索。

Conclusion: APML损失函数有效解决了点云预测任务中传统损失函数的局限性，在保持计算效率的同时实现了更好的空间分布和性能表现，为点云生成和补全任务提供了更优的损失函数选择。

Abstract: Training deep learning models for point cloud prediction tasks such as shape
completion and generation depends critically on loss functions that measure
discrepancies between predicted and ground-truth point sets. Commonly used
functions such as Chamfer Distance (CD), HyperCD, and InfoCD rely on
nearest-neighbor assignments, which often induce many-to-one correspondences,
leading to point congestion in dense regions and poor coverage in sparse
regions. These losses also involve non-differentiable operations due to index
selection, which may affect gradient-based optimization. Earth Mover Distance
(EMD) enforces one-to-one correspondences and captures structural similarity
more effectively, but its cubic computational complexity limits its practical
use. We propose the Adaptive Probabilistic Matching Loss (APML), a fully
differentiable approximation of one-to-one matching that leverages Sinkhorn
iterations on a temperature-scaled similarity matrix derived from pairwise
distances. We analytically compute the temperature to guarantee a minimum
assignment probability, eliminating manual tuning. APML achieves near-quadratic
runtime, comparable to Chamfer-based losses, and avoids non-differentiable
operations. When integrated into state-of-the-art architectures (PoinTr, PCN,
FoldingNet) on ShapeNet benchmarks and on a spatiotemporal Transformer (CSI2PC)
that generates 3D human point clouds from WiFi CSI measurements, APM loss
yields faster convergence, superior spatial distribution, especially in
low-density regions, and improved or on-par quantitative performance without
additional hyperparameter search. The code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出L-RPCANet轻量级框架，通过分层瓶颈结构和噪声抑制模块解决红外小目标检测中的参数轻量化和噪声鲁棒性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度展开网络在红外小目标检测中面临参数不够轻量和噪声鲁棒性不足的挑战

Method: 基于RPCA构建分层瓶颈结构进行通道维度调整，嵌入噪声抑制模块，并采用SENet通道注意力机制

Result: 在ISTD数据集上验证了优于RPCANet、DRPCANet和RPCANet++等先进方法的性能

Conclusion: L-RPCANet在保持轻量化和鲁棒性的同时实现了优异的检测性能

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) is one of the key techniques in image
processing. Although deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have demonstrated promising
performance in ISTD due to their model interpretability and data adaptability,
existing methods still face significant challenges in parameter lightweightness
and noise robustness. In this regard, we propose a highly lightweight framework
based on robust principal component analysis (RPCA) called L-RPCANet.
Technically, a hierarchical bottleneck structure is constructed to reduce and
increase the channel dimension in the single-channel input infrared image to
achieve channel-wise feature refinement, with bottleneck layers designed in
each module to extract features. This reduces the number of channels in feature
extraction and improves the lightweightness of network parameters. Furthermore,
a noise reduction module is embedded to enhance the robustness against complex
noise. In addition, squeeze-and-excitation networks (SENets) are leveraged as a
channel attention mechanism to focus on the varying importance of different
features across channels, thereby achieving excellent performance while
maintaining both lightweightness and robustness. Extensive experiments on the
ISTD datasets validate the superiority of our proposed method compared with
state-of-the-art methods covering RPCANet, DRPCANet, and RPCANet++. The code
will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/L-RPCANet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出超稀疇采样(USS)策略和BSTFormer模型，通过降低数码相机的能耗来实现高速视频的压缩成像，在保持高动态范围的同时显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数码相机在高分辨率高帧率情况下能耗过高，压缩成像技术需要更有效的采样策略来降低能耗。

Method: 提出USS采样策略（每个空间位置只有一帧为1）和BSTFormer模型，结合局部坐标注意力、全局稀疇注意力和时间注意力来利用USS测量的稀疇性。

Result: 在模拟和实际数据上，方法显著超越了所有现有最优算法，并具有比随机采样更高的动态范围。

Conclusion: USS策略是实现芯片级视频SCI系统的良好选择，其固定曝光时间和高动态范围使其在实际应用中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Digital cameras consume ~0.1 microjoule per pixel to capture and encode
video, resulting in a power usage of ~20W for a 4K sensor operating at 30 fps.
Imagining gigapixel cameras operating at 100-1000 fps, the current processing
model is unsustainable. To address this, physical layer compressive measurement
has been proposed to reduce power consumption per pixel by 10-100X. Video
Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) introduces high frequency modulation in the
optical sensor layer to increase effective frame rate. A commonly used sampling
strategy of video SCI is Random Sampling (RS) where each mask element value is
randomly set to be 0 or 1. Similarly, image inpainting (I2P) has demonstrated
that images can be recovered from a fraction of the image pixels. Inspired by
I2P, we propose Ultra-Sparse Sampling (USS) regime, where at each spatial
location, only one sub-frame is set to 1 and all others are set to 0. We then
build a Digital Micro-mirror Device (DMD) encoding system to verify the
effectiveness of our USS strategy. Ideally, we can decompose the USS
measurement into sub-measurements for which we can utilize I2P algorithms to
recover high-speed frames. However, due to the mismatch between the DMD and
CCD, the USS measurement cannot be perfectly decomposed. To this end, we
propose BSTFormer, a sparse TransFormer that utilizes local Block attention,
global Sparse attention, and global Temporal attention to exploit the sparsity
of the USS measurement. Extensive results on both simulated and real-world data
show that our method significantly outperforms all previous state-of-the-art
algorithms. Additionally, an essential advantage of the USS strategy is its
higher dynamic range than that of the RS strategy. Finally, from the
application perspective, the USS strategy is a good choice to implement a
complete video SCI system on chip due to its fixed exposure time.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video anomaly detection (VAD) have enabled
identification of various criminal activities in surveillance videos, but
detecting fatal incidents such as shootings and stabbings remains difficult due
to their rarity and ethical issues in data collection. Recognizing this
limitation, we introduce GTA-Crime, a fatal video anomaly dataset and
generation framework using Grand Theft Auto 5 (GTA5). Our dataset contains
fatal situations such as shootings and stabbings, captured from CCTV multiview
perspectives under diverse conditions including action types, weather, time of
day, and viewpoints. To address the rarity of such scenarios, we also release a
framework for generating these types of videos. Additionally, we propose a
snippet-level domain adaptation strategy using Wasserstein adversarial training
to bridge the gap between synthetic GTA-Crime features and real-world features
like UCF-Crime. Experimental results validate our GTA-Crime dataset and
demonstrate that incorporating GTA-Crime with our domain adaptation strategy
consistently enhances real world fatal violence detection accuracy. Our dataset
and the data generation framework are publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出RepViT-CXR方法，通过通道复制策略将单通道胸部X光图像适配到ViT架构，在TB和肺炎检测任务上达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Vision Transformers在医学图像分析中的应用限制，因为ViT通常需要三通道输入而CXR是单通道灰度图像

Method: 采用通道复制策略，将单通道CXR图像转换为ViT兼容的三通道格式，避免信息损失

Result: 在三个基准数据集上表现优异：TB-CXR数据集准确率99.9%、AUC 99.9%；儿科肺炎数据集准确率99.0%、AUC 99.0%；深圳TB数据集准确率91.1%、AUC 91.2%

Conclusion: 简单有效的通道复制策略能让ViT在灰度医学图像任务中充分发挥表征能力，为临床筛查系统部署提供了强有力支持

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging remains one of the most widely used diagnostic
tools for detecting pulmonary diseases such as tuberculosis (TB) and pneumonia.
Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Vision Transformers (ViTs), have
shown strong potential for automated medical image analysis. However, most ViT
architectures are pretrained on natural images and require three-channel
inputs, while CXR scans are inherently grayscale. To address this gap, we
propose RepViT-CXR, a channel replication strategy that adapts single-channel
CXR images into a ViT-compatible format without introducing additional
information loss. We evaluate RepViT-CXR on three benchmark datasets. On the
TB-CXR dataset,our method achieved an accuracy of 99.9% and an AUC of 99.9%,
surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods such as Topo-CXR (99.3% accuracy,
99.8% AUC). For the Pediatric Pneumonia dataset, RepViT-CXR obtained 99.0%
accuracy, with 99.2% recall, 99.3% precision, and an AUC of 99.0%,
outperforming strong baselines including DCNN and VGG16. On the Shenzhen TB
dataset, our approach achieved 91.1% accuracy and an AUC of 91.2%, marking a
performance improvement over previously reported CNN-based methods. These
results demonstrate that a simple yet effective channel replication strategy
allows ViTs to fully leverage their representational power on grayscale medical
imaging tasks. RepViT-CXR establishes a new state of the art for TB and
pneumonia detection from chest X-rays, showing strong potential for deployment
in real-world clinical screening systems.

Motivation: 现有研究大多基于预训练或忽略脑部疾病引起的不对称特征，需要开发能够有效捕捉AD引起的左右脑萎缩不对称性的方法

Abstract: Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) combined with deep learning has
achieved remarkable progress in the prediction and diagnosis of Alzheimer's
disease (AD). Existing studies have used CNN and transformer to build a
well-performing network, but most of them are based on pretraining or ignoring
the asymmetrical character caused by brain disorders. We propose an end-to-end
network for the detection of disease-based asymmetric induced by left and right
brain atrophy which consist of 3D CNN Encoder and Symmetry Interactive
Transformer (SIT). Following the inter-equal grid block fetch operation, the
corresponding left and right hemisphere features are aligned and subsequently
fed into the SIT for diagnostic analysis. SIT can help the model focus more on
the regions of asymmetry caused by structural changes, thus improving
diagnostic performance. We evaluated our method based on the ADNI dataset, and
the results show that the method achieves better diagnostic accuracy (92.5\%)
compared to several CNN methods and CNNs combined with a general transformer.
The visualization results show that our network pays more attention in regions
of brain atrophy, especially for the asymmetric pathological characteristics
induced by AD, demonstrating the interpretability and effectiveness of the
method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EVDI++是一个自监督的事件相机视频去模糊和插值框架，利用事件相机的高时间分辨率来减少运动模糊并预测中间帧，在合成和真实数据集上都达到了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统帧式相机在长曝光时间下会产生明显的视觉模糊和帧间信息丢失，严重影响视频质量。事件相机具有高时间分辨率，可以用于解决这一问题。

Method: 提出Learnable Double Integral (LDI)网络估计参考帧与潜在清晰图像的映射关系；引入基于学习的除法重建模块优化结果和训练效率；设计无参数自适应融合策略；构建自监督学习框架利用模糊帧、潜在图像和事件流之间的相互约束。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在视频去模糊和插值任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: EVDI++是一个有效的统一框架，能够利用事件相机的高时间分辨率来解决视频模糊和帧间信息丢失问题，在真实场景中具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Frame-based cameras with extended exposure times often produce perceptible
visual blurring and information loss between frames, significantly degrading
video quality. To address this challenge, we introduce EVDI++, a unified
self-supervised framework for Event-based Video Deblurring and Interpolation
that leverages the high temporal resolution of event cameras to mitigate motion
blur and enable intermediate frame prediction. Specifically, the Learnable
Double Integral (LDI) network is designed to estimate the mapping relation
between reference frames and sharp latent images. Then, we refine the coarse
results and optimize overall training efficiency by introducing a
learning-based division reconstruction module, enabling images to be converted
with varying exposure intervals. We devise an adaptive parameter-free fusion
strategy to obtain the final results, utilizing the confidence embedded in the
LDI outputs of concurrent events. A self-supervised learning framework is
proposed to enable network training with real-world blurry videos and events by
exploring the mutual constraints among blurry frames, latent images, and event
streams. We further construct a dataset with real-world blurry images and
events using a DAVIS346c camera, demonstrating the generalizability of the
proposed EVDI++ in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in video deblurring and interpolation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高光谱跟踪器无法有效捕获内在光谱信息、时间依赖性和跨深度交互，需要新的方法来充分利用高光谱数据的丰富信息

Method: 使用Spectral State Integration (SSI)模块进行渐进式光谱特征精炼和传播，通过Hyperspectral Mamba (HSM)模块同步学习空间和光谱信息，构建假彩色和高光谱输入的联合特征

Result: 在7个基准数据集上达到最先进性能，在HOTC2020数据集上获得73.0%的AUC分数和96.3%的DP@20分数

Conclusion: HyMamba网络通过统一的光谱、跨深度和时间建模，有效解决了高光谱目标跟踪中的关键挑战，实现了卓越的跟踪性能

Abstract: Hyperspectral object tracking holds great promise due to the rich spectral
information and fine-grained material distinctions in hyperspectral images,
which are beneficial in challenging scenarios. While existing hyperspectral
trackers have made progress by either transforming hyperspectral data into
false-color images or incorporating modality fusion strategies, they often fail
to capture the intrinsic spectral information, temporal dependencies, and
cross-depth interactions. To address these limitations, a new hyperspectral
object tracking network equipped with Mamba (HyMamba), is proposed. It unifies
spectral, cross-depth, and temporal modeling through state space modules
(SSMs). The core of HyMamba lies in the Spectral State Integration (SSI)
module, which enables progressive refinement and propagation of spectral
features with cross-depth and temporal spectral information. Embedded within
each SSI, the Hyperspectral Mamba (HSM) module is introduced to learn spatial
and spectral information synchronously via three directional scanning SSMs.
Based on SSI and HSM, HyMamba constructs joint features from false-color and
hyperspectral inputs, and enhances them through interaction with original
spectral features extracted from raw hyperspectral images. Extensive
experiments conducted on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyMamba
achieves state-of-the-art performance. For instance, it achieves 73.0\% of the
AUC score and 96.3\% of the DP@20 score on the HOTC2020 dataset. The code will
be released at https://github.com/lgao001/HyMamba.

TL;DR: VLMs存在固有偏见，在回答需要关注图像特定区域的细节问题时表现不佳，本文通过多维度框架分析输入数据特征对模型性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现VLMs在处理需要关注图像特定视觉属性的问题时，会依赖训练时学到的固有偏见而忽视视觉证据，导致回答不准确。需要系统分析哪些输入特征会导致这种性能差异。

Method: 建立多维度检测框架，使用开源VLMs，分析不同输入参数（图像大小、物体数量、背景颜色、提示词特异性）对注意力值变化的影响。

Result: 即使图像特征和提示词特异性的微小修改，也会导致VLM答案生成方式和整体性能发生巨大变化。

Conclusion: 需要深入理解VLMs行为变化机制，并探索表征这些变化的方法，以提高模型在细节视觉问题上的准确性。

Abstract: Recent research on Vision Language Models (VLMs) suggests that they rely on
inherent biases learned during training to respond to questions about visual
properties of an image. These biases are exacerbated when VLMs are asked highly
specific questions that require focusing on specific areas of the image. For
example, a VLM tasked with counting stars on a modified American flag (e.g.,
with more than 50 stars) will often disregard the visual evidence and fail to
answer accurately. We build upon this research and develop a multi-dimensional
examination framework to systematically determine which characteristics of the
input data, including both the image and the accompanying prompt, lead to such
differences in performance. Using open-source VLMs, we further examine how
attention values fluctuate with varying input parameters (e.g., image size,
number of objects in the image, background color, prompt specificity). This
research aims to learn how the behavior of vision language models changes and
to explore methods for characterizing such changes. Our results suggest, among
other things, that even minor modifications in image characteristics and prompt
specificity can lead to large changes in how a VLM formulates its answer and,
subsequently, its overall performance.

TL;DR: E3DPC-GZSL是一种针对3D点云广义零样本语义分割的新方法，通过证据不确定性估计和动态校准机制解决seen类过拟合问题，在ScanNet v2和S3DIS数据集上达到SOTA性能。

Motivation: 解决3D点云广义零样本分割中模型对seen类的预测偏置问题，特别是在训练数据规模较小的3D应用中，该问题比图像任务更为突出。

Method: 集成证据不确定性估计器到分类器中，使用动态校准堆叠因子调整预测概率；提出新颖训练策略，通过合并可学习参数和文本特征来改进语义空间和不确定性估计。

Conclusion: E3DPC-GZSL有效解决了3D点云零样本分割中的seen类过拟合问题，无需为seen和unseen数据使用单独分类器，通过不确定性估计和语义空间优化提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds aims to
classify each point into both seen and unseen classes. A significant challenge
with these models is their tendency to make biased predictions, often favoring
the classes encountered during training. This problem is more pronounced in 3D
applications, where the scale of the training data is typically smaller than in
image-based tasks. To address this problem, we propose a novel method called
E3DPC-GZSL, which reduces overconfident predictions towards seen classes
without relying on separate classifiers for seen and unseen data. E3DPC-GZSL
tackles the overconfidence problem by integrating an evidence-based uncertainty
estimator into a classifier. This estimator is then used to adjust prediction
probabilities using a dynamic calibrated stacking factor that accounts for
pointwise prediction uncertainty. In addition, E3DPC-GZSL introduces a novel
training strategy that improves uncertainty estimation by refining the semantic
space. This is achieved by merging learnable parameters with text-derived
features, thereby improving model optimization for unseen data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation datasets, including
ScanNet v2 and S3DIS.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的弱监督物体检测方法存在三个关键问题：1)伪真实框要么只覆盖区别性部分，要么无法区分相邻同类实例；2)基础WSDDN网络缺乏背景类表征且分支间语义间隔大；3)忽略建议在优化中被丢弃，导致收敛慢。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法有效解决了弱监督物体检测中的三大关键问题，通过热力图导向、背景类表征咏负确定性监督等技术，显著提升了检测性能咏收敛速度，为该领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) has attracted significant attention
in recent years, as it does not require box-level annotations. State-of-the-art
methods generally adopt a multi-module network, which employs WSDDN as the
multiple instance detection network module and multiple instance refinement
modules to refine performance. However, these approaches suffer from three key
limitations. First, existing methods tend to generate pseudo GT boxes that
either focus only on discriminative parts, failing to capture the whole object,
or cover the entire object but fail to distinguish between adjacent intra-class
instances. Second, the foundational WSDDN architecture lacks a crucial
background class representation for each proposal and exhibits a large semantic
gap between its branches. Third, prior methods discard ignored proposals during
optimization, leading to slow convergence. To address these challenges, we
first design a heatmap-guided proposal selector (HGPS) algorithm, which
utilizes dual thresholds on heatmaps to pre-select proposals, enabling pseudo
GT boxes to both capture the full object extent and distinguish between
adjacent intra-class instances. We then present a weakly supervised basic
detection network (WSBDN), which augments each proposal with a background class
representation and uses heatmaps for pre-supervision to bridge the semantic gap
between matrices. At last, we introduce a negative certainty supervision loss
on ignored proposals to accelerate convergence. Extensive experiments on the
challenging PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our framework. We achieve mAP/mCorLoc scores of 58.5%/81.8% on VOC 2007 and
55.6%/80.5% on VOC 2012, performing favorably against the state-of-the-art WSOD
methods. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract: Oil palm cultivation remains one of the leading causes of deforestation in
Indonesia. To better track and address this challenge, detailed and reliable
mapping is needed to support sustainability efforts and emerging regulatory
frameworks. We present an open-access geospatial dataset of oil palm
plantations and related land cover types in Indonesia, produced through expert
labeling of high-resolution satellite imagery from 2020 to 2024. The dataset
provides polygon-based, wall-to-wall annotations across a range of
agro-ecological zones and includes a hierarchical typology that distinguishes
oil palm planting stages as well as similar perennial crops. Quality was
ensured through multi-interpreter consensus and field validation. The dataset
was created using wall-to-wall digitization over large grids, making it
suitable for training and benchmarking both conventional convolutional neural
networks and newer geospatial foundation models. Released under a CC-BY
license, it fills a key gap in training data for remote sensing and aims to
improve the accuracy of land cover types mapping. By supporting transparent
monitoring of oil palm expansion, the resource contributes to global
deforestation reduction goals and follows FAIR data principles.

Conclusion: SimCroP框架能够有效捕捉稀疏放射影像中的关键病理结构，在多尺度下游任务中表现出优异的性能

Abstract: Medical vision-language pre-training shows great potential in learning
representative features from massive paired radiographs and reports. However,
in computed tomography (CT) scans, the distribution of lesions which contain
intricate structures is characterized by spatial sparsity. Besides, the complex
and implicit relationships between different pathological descriptions in each
sentence of the report and their corresponding sub-regions in radiographs pose
additional challenges. In this paper, we propose a Similarity-Driven
Cross-Granularity Pre-training (SimCroP) framework on chest CTs, which combines
similarity-driven alignment and cross-granularity fusion to improve radiograph
interpretation. We first leverage multi-modal masked modeling to optimize the
encoder for understanding precise low-level semantics from radiographs. Then,
similarity-driven alignment is designed to pre-train the encoder to adaptively
select and align the correct patches corresponding to each sentence in reports.
The cross-granularity fusion module integrates multimodal information across
instance level and word-patch level, which helps the model better capture key
pathology structures in sparse radiographs, resulting in improved performance
for multi-scale downstream tasks. SimCroP is pre-trained on a large-scale
paired CT-reports dataset and validated on image classification and
segmentation tasks across five public datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that SimCroP outperforms both cutting-edge medical self-supervised
learning methods and medical vision-language pre-training methods. Codes and
models are available at https://github.com/ToniChopp/SimCroP.

TL;DR: BTS-EE是一种针对早期退出网络的顺序训练方法，通过逐层训练分支来匹配推理时的数据分布，解决了传统训练中的协方差偏移问题，在CINIC-10数据集上实现了计算量减少45%而精度仅下降2%的效果。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时图像分类在资源受限平台上需要平衡精度和延迟/功耗。传统早期退出策略存在协方差偏移问题：下游分支在全数据集上训练，但推理时只处理困难的未退出样本，这种不匹配限制了效率-精度的权衡。

Result: 在CINIC-10数据集上使用ResNet18骨干网络的64种配置实验中，BTS-EE始终优于非增强训练方法，实现了计算量最多减少45%而精度仅下降2%的效果。

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了CNN在实时图像处理系统中的部署设计空间，为工业检测、嵌入式视觉和无人机监控等应用提供了实际的效率提升。

Abstract: Real-time image classification on resource-constrained platforms demands
inference methods that balance accuracy with strict latency and power budgets.
Early-exit strategies address this need by attaching auxiliary classifiers to
intermediate layers of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), allowing "easy"
samples to terminate inference early. However, conventional training of early
exits introduces a covariance shift: downstream branches are trained on full
datasets, while at inference they process only the harder, non-exited samples.
This mismatch limits efficiency--accuracy trade-offs in practice. We introduce
the Boosted Training Scheme for Early Exits (BTS-EE), a sequential training
approach that aligns branch training with inference-time data distributions.
Each branch is trained and calibrated before the next, ensuring robustness
under selective inference conditions. To further support embedded deployment,
we propose a lightweight branch architecture based on 1D convolutions and a
Class Precision Margin (CPM) calibration method that enables per-class
threshold tuning for reliable exit decisions. Experiments on the CINIC-10
dataset with a ResNet18 backbone demonstrate that BTS-EE consistently
outperforms non-boosted training across 64 configurations, achieving up to 45
percent reduction in computation with only 2 percent accuracy degradation.
These results expand the design space for deploying CNNs in real-time image
processing systems, offering practical efficiency gains for applications such
as industrial inspection, embedded vision, and UAV-based monitoring.

Abstract: Accurate and early diagnosis of malignant melanoma is critical for improving
patient outcomes. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promise
in dermoscopic image analysis, they often neglect clinical metadata and require
extensive preprocessing. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer a multimodal
alternative but struggle to capture clinical specificity when trained on
general-domain data. To address this, we propose a retrieval-augmented VLM
framework that incorporates semantically similar patient cases into the
diagnostic prompt. Our method enables informed predictions without fine-tuning
and significantly improves classification accuracy and error correction over
conventional baselines. These results demonstrate that retrieval-augmented
prompting provides a robust strategy for clinical decision support.

Abstract: Three-dimensional Object Detection from multi-view cameras and LiDAR is a
crucial component for autonomous driving and smart transportation. However, in
the process of basic feature extraction, perspective transformation, and

mitigating the impact of accumulated errors. Additionally, by incorporating
attention mechanisms applied to the raw features, it thereby mitigates the
impact of accumulated errors. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate
that InsFusion is compatible with various advanced baseline methods and
delivers new state-of-the-art performance for 3D object detection.

Abstract: We propose a novel and general framework to disentangle video data into its
dynamic motion and static content components. Our proposed method is a
self-supervised pipeline with less assumptions and inductive biases than
previous works: it utilizes a transformer-based architecture to jointly
generate flexible implicit features for frame-wise motion and clip-wise
content, and incorporates a low-bitrate vector quantization as an information
bottleneck to promote disentanglement and form a meaningful discrete motion
space. The bitrate-controlled latent motion and content are used as conditional
inputs to a denoising diffusion model to facilitate self-supervised
representation learning. We validate our disentangled representation learning
framework on real-world talking head videos with motion transfer and
auto-regressive motion generation tasks. Furthermore, we also show that our
method can generalize to other types of video data, such as pixel sprites of 2D
cartoon characters. Our work presents a new perspective on self-supervised
learning of disentangled video representations, contributing to the broader
field of video analysis and generation.

Abstract: Vision-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction is a critical task in 3D vision
that integrates volumetric 3D reconstruction with semantic understanding.
Existing methods, however, often rely on modular pipelines. These modules are
typically optimized independently or use pre-configured inputs, leading to
cascading errors. In this paper, we address this limitation by designing a
novel causal loss that enables holistic, end-to-end supervision of the modular
2D-to-3D transformation pipeline. Grounded in the principle of 2D-to-3D
semantic causality, this loss regulates the gradient flow from 3D voxel
representations back to the 2D features. Consequently, it renders the entire
pipeline differentiable, unifying the learning process and making previously
non-trainable components fully learnable. Building on this principle, we
propose the Semantic Causality-Aware 2D-to-3D Transformation, which comprises
three components guided by our causal loss: Channel-Grouped Lifting for
adaptive semantic mapping, Learnable Camera Offsets for enhanced robustness
against camera perturbations, and Normalized Convolution for effective feature
propagation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the Occ3D benchmark, demonstrating significant
robustness to camera perturbations and improved 2D-to-3D semantic consistency.

weather, poor lighting, or high-speed motion often suffer from severe noise and
blur. Such degradations significantly reduce the accuracy of license plate
recognition systems, especially when the plate occupies only a small region
within the full vehicle image. Restoring these degraded images a fast realtime
manner is thus a crucial pre-processing step to enhance recognition
performance. In this work, we propose a Vertical Residual Autoencoder (VRAE)
architecture designed for the image enhancement task in traffic surveillance.
The method incorporates an enhancement strategy that employs an auxiliary
block, which injects input-aware features at each encoding stage to guide the
representation learning process, enabling better general information
preservation throughout the network compared to conventional autoencoders.
Experiments on a vehicle image dataset with visible license plates demonstrate
that our method consistently outperforms Autoencoder (AE), Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN), and Flow-Based (FB) approaches. Compared with AE at
the same depth, it improves PSNR by about 20\%, reduces NMSE by around 50\%,
and enhances SSIM by 1\%, while requiring only a marginal increase of roughly
1\% in parameters.

*Keisuke Toida,Taigo Sakai,Naoki Kato,Kazutoyo Yokota,Takeshi Nakamura,Kazuhiro Hotta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCFusion是一个多视角多目标跟踪框架，通过稀疏变换、密度感知加权和多视角一致性损失来解决BEV投影中的特征失真问题，在WildTrack和MultiviewX数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视角多目标跟踪中，由于视角变化、光照变化和遮挡等因素，跨相机保持目标身份一致性具有挑战性。传统BEV投影方法存在特征失真和非均匀密度问题，降低了检测和跟踪精度。

Method: 提出SCFusion框架，包含三个关键技术：1）稀疏变换避免投影中的不自然插值；2）密度感知加权基于空间置信度和相机距离自适应融合特征；3）多视角一致性损失促使每个相机在融合前学习判别性特征。

Result: 在WildTrack数据集上达到95.9%的IDF1分数，在MultiviewX数据集上达到89.2%的MODP分数，超越了基准方法TrackTacular的性能。

Conclusion: SCFusion有效缓解了传统BEV投影的局限性，为多视角目标检测和跟踪提供了鲁棒且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-View Multi-Object Tracking (MVMOT) is essential for applications such
as surveillance, autonomous driving, and sports analytics. However, maintaining
consistent object identities across multiple cameras remains challenging due to
viewpoint changes, lighting variations, and occlusions, which often lead to
tracking errors.Recent methods project features from multiple cameras into a
unified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) space to improve robustness against occlusion.
However, this projection introduces feature distortion and non-uniform density
caused by variations in object scale with distance. These issues degrade the
quality of the fused representation and reduce detection and tracking
accuracy.To address these problems, we propose SCFusion, a framework that
combines three techniques to improve multi-view feature integration. First, it
applies a sparse transformation to avoid unnatural interpolation during
projection. Next, it performs density-aware weighting to adaptively fuse
features based on spatial confidence and camera distance. Finally, it
introduces a multi-view consistency loss that encourages each camera to learn
discriminative features independently before fusion.Experiments show that
SCFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching an IDF1 score of 95.9%
on WildTrack and a MODP of 89.2% on MultiviewX, outperforming the baseline
method TrackTacular. These results demonstrate that SCFusion effectively
mitigates the limitations of conventional BEV projection and provides a robust
and accurate solution for multi-view object detection and tracking.

TL;DR: LD-ViCE是一个基于潜在扩散模型的视频反事实解释框架，通过在潜在空间中操作降低计算成本，同时生成真实且可解释的反事实解释，在多个视频数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频AI系统在安全关键领域应用广泛，但现有解释技术存在时间连贯性不足、鲁棒性差、缺乏因果洞察等问题，且现有反事实解释方法通常缺乏目标模型指导，导致语义保真度和实用性降低。

Method: LD-ViCE采用最先进的扩散模型在潜在空间中操作，通过额外的精炼步骤生成真实且可解释的反事实解释，显著降低计算成本。

Result: 在EchoNet-Dynamic、FERV39k和Something-Something V2三个视频数据集上，LD-ViCE相比现有最优方法R2分数提升高达68%，推理时间减少一半，生成的解释具有语义意义和时间连贯性。

Conclusion: LD-ViCE是向安全关键领域可信AI部署迈出的重要一步，能够为目标模型行为提供有价值的洞察。

Abstract: Video-based AI systems are increasingly adopted in safety-critical domains
such as autonomous driving and healthcare. However, interpreting their
decisions remains challenging due to the inherent spatiotemporal complexity of
video data and the opacity of deep learning models. Existing explanation
techniques often suffer from limited temporal coherence, insufficient
robustness, and a lack of actionable causal insights. Current counterfactual
explanation methods typically do not incorporate guidance from the target
model, reducing semantic fidelity and practical utility. We introduce Latent
Diffusion for Video Counterfactual Explanations (LD-ViCE), a novel framework
designed to explain the behavior of video-based AI models. Compared to previous
approaches, LD-ViCE reduces the computational costs of generating explanations
by operating in latent space using a state-of-the-art diffusion model, while
producing realistic and interpretable counterfactuals through an additional
refinement step. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LD-ViCE
across three diverse video datasets, including EchoNet-Dynamic (cardiac
ultrasound), FERV39k (facial expression), and Something-Something V2 (action
recognition). LD-ViCE outperforms a recent state-of-the-art method, achieving
an increase in R2 score of up to 68% while reducing inference time by half.
Qualitative analysis confirms that LD-ViCE generates semantically meaningful
and temporally coherent explanations, offering valuable insights into the
target model behavior. LD-ViCE represents a valuable step toward the
trustworthy deployment of AI in safety-critical domains.

TL;DR: 提出了HyperTTA框架，通过多退化高光谱数据集构建、光谱-空间Transformer分类器增强以及轻量级测试时自适应策略，显著提升了高光谱图像分类模型在各种退化条件下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像分类模型对噪声、模糊、压缩和大气效应等现实世界退化引起的分布偏移高度敏感，需要提高模型在各种退化条件下的鲁棒性。

Method: 1) 构建包含9种代表性退化的多退化高光谱数据集；2) 设计带有多级感受野机制和标签平滑正则化的光谱-空间Transformer分类器；3) 提出置信度感知的熵最小化LayerNorm适配器(CELA)进行轻量级测试时自适应。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的大量实验表明，HyperTTA在各种退化场景下均优于现有基线方法，验证了其分类主干和TTA方案的有效性。

Conclusion: HyperTTA框架通过系统性的数据集构建、分类器设计和测试时自适应策略，有效解决了高光谱图像分类中的分布偏移问题，为实际应用提供了鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification models are highly sensitive to
distribution shifts caused by various real-world degradations such as noise,
blur, compression, and atmospheric effects. To address this challenge, we
propose HyperTTA, a unified framework designed to enhance model robustness
under diverse degradation conditions. Specifically, we first construct a
multi-degradation hyperspectral dataset that systematically simulates nine
representative types of degradations, providing a comprehensive benchmark for
robust classification evaluation. Based on this, we design a spectral-spatial
transformer classifier (SSTC) enhanced with a multi-level receptive field
mechanism and label smoothing regularization to jointly capture multi-scale
spatial context and improve generalization. Furthermore, HyperTTA incorporates
a lightweight test-time adaptation (TTA) strategy, the confidence-aware
entropy-minimized LayerNorm adapter (CELA), which updates only the affine
parameters of LayerNorm layers by minimizing prediction entropy on
high-confidence unlabeled target samples. This confidence-aware adaptation
prevents unreliable updates from noisy predictions, enabling robust and dynamic
adaptation without access to source data or target annotations. Extensive
experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyperTTA outperforms
existing baselines across a wide range of degradation scenarios, validating the
effectiveness of both its classification backbone and the proposed TTA scheme.
Code will be made available publicly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测个体化高分辨率皮层厚度轨迹对于检测细微皮层变化、理解神经退行性过程和实现早期精确干预至关重要，但由于皮层复杂几何形状和多模态数据整合的挑战而难以实现。

Method: 采用双向条件布朗桥扩散过程，提出条件球形U-Net(CoS-UNet)去噪模型，结合球形卷积和密集交叉注意力机制，无缝整合皮层表面和表格条件数据。

Result: 相比先前方法，SBDM在ADNI和OASIS纵向数据集上实现了显著降低的预测误差，并能生成个体事实和反事实皮层厚度轨迹。

Conclusion: SBDM为探索皮层发育假设情景提供了一个新颖框架，在皮层厚度预测方面表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of individualized, high-resolution cortical thickness
(CTh) trajectories is essential for detecting subtle cortical changes,
providing invaluable insights into neurodegenerative processes and facilitating
earlier and more precise intervention strategies. However, CTh forecasting is a
challenging task due to the intricate non-Euclidean geometry of the cerebral
cortex and the need to integrate multi-modal data for subject-specific
predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce the Spherical Brownian
Bridge Diffusion Model (SBDM). Specifically, we propose a bidirectional
conditional Brownian bridge diffusion process to forecast CTh trajectories at
the vertex level of registered cortical surfaces. Our technical contribution
includes a new denoising model, the conditional spherical U-Net (CoS-UNet),
which combines spherical convolutions and dense cross-attention to integrate
cortical surfaces and tabular conditions seamlessly. Compared to previous
approaches, SBDM achieves significantly reduced prediction errors, as
demonstrated by our experiments based on longitudinal datasets from the ADNI
and OASIS. Additionally, we demonstrate SBDM's ability to generate individual
factual and counterfactual CTh trajectories, offering a novel framework for
exploring hypothetical scenarios of cortical development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Mamba视觉模型主要关注网络架构和扫描路径，对SSM模块本身的研究较少。为了挖掘SSM的潜力，需要改进其计算过程。

Method: 在SSM中应用一阶保持条件，推导新的离散化形式，并分析累积误差，通过引入token相关性来增强原始Mamba模块。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，FSSM提升了MambaIR的性能，超越了当前轻量级超分辨率方法，达到了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: FSSM通过改进SSM计算过程，在不增加参数量的情况下显著提升了轻量级超分辨率任务的性能，证明了SSM模块优化的重要性。

Abstract: State space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have shown promise in NLP
tasks and are increasingly applied to vision tasks. However, most Mamba-based
vision models focus on network architecture and scan paths, with little
attention to the SSM module. In order to explore the potential of SSMs, we
modified the calculation process of SSM without increasing the number of
parameters to improve the performance on lightweight super-resolution tasks. In
this paper, we introduce the First-order State Space Model (FSSM) to improve
the original Mamba module, enhancing performance by incorporating token
correlations. We apply a first-order hold condition in SSMs, derive the new
discretized form, and analyzed cumulative error. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that FSSM improves the performance of MambaIR on five benchmark
datasets without additionally increasing the number of parameters, and
surpasses current lightweight SR methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于互信息理论的多视图对比自监督学习方法，用于解决不平衡数据集中的表示学习问题，在多个基准数据集上实现了SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比自监督学习在平衡数据集上表现良好，但在不平衡数据集上泛化能力不足。受Yann LeCun关于多视图框架扩展的启发，需要开发能够更好处理不平衡数据集的方法。

Method: 基于互信息理论提出多视图目标函数，通过区分类内和类间判别特征来提取尾部类的代表性特征，引入新的损失函数过滤极端特征以学习更好的表示。

Result: 在多种自监督框架（对比和非对比）上验证有效，在Cifar10-LT上提升2%（ResNet-18），Cifar100-LT上提升5%（ResNet-18），Imagenet-LT上提升3%（ResNet-50）。

Conclusion: 多视图目标函数能够有效改善不平衡数据集上的自监督学习性能，为处理数据集不平衡问题提供了新的理论框架和实践方法。

Abstract: The robustness of contrastive self-supervised learning (CSSL) for imbalanced
datasets is largely unexplored. CSSL usually makes use of \emph{multi-view}
assumptions to learn discriminatory features via similar and dissimilar data
samples. CSSL works well on balanced datasets, but does not generalize well for
imbalanced datasets. In a very recent paper, as part of future work, Yann LeCun
pointed out that the self-supervised multiview framework can be extended to
cases involving \emph{more than two views}. Taking a cue from this insight we
propose a theoretical justification based on the concept of \emph{mutual
information} to support the \emph{more than two views} objective and apply it
to the problem of dataset imbalance in self-supervised learning. The proposed
method helps extract representative characteristics of the tail classes by
segregating between \emph{intra} and \emph{inter} discriminatory
characteristics. We introduce a loss function that helps us to learn better
representations by filtering out extreme features. Experimental evaluation on a
variety of self-supervised frameworks (both contrastive and non-contrastive)
also prove that the \emph{more than two view} objective works well for
imbalanced datasets. We achieve a new state-of-the-art accuracy in
self-supervised imbalanced dataset classification (2\% improvement in
Cifar10-LT using Resnet-18, 5\% improvement in Cifar100-LT using Resnet-18, 3\%
improvement in Imagenet-LT (1k) using Resnet-50).

Motivation: 将多个计算机视觉任务统一到单个自然语言指令驱动的流水线中，提高对象替换、场景增强和删除操作的可靠性和可重现性。

Method: 设计了一个结合开放词汇检测、可提示分割、文本条件填充和视觉语言描述的统一流水线，包括阈值调整、面具形态学检查、资源意识默认值等集成选择。

Result: 在单词提示测试中，检测和分割的可用面具率超过90%，准确率超过85%；在高端GPU上，填充占总运行时间的60-75%。

Conclusion: 提供了一个透明、可靠的模式，通过明确的拦截标志和运维实践来组织现代视觉和多模态模型，提高了对象替换、场景增强和删除操作的可靠性。

Abstract: Prompt-driven image analysis converts a single natural-language instruction
into multiple steps: locate, segment, edit, and describe. We present a
practical case study of a unified pipeline that combines open-vocabulary
detection, promptable segmentation, text-conditioned inpainting, and
vision-language description into a single workflow. The system works end to end
from a single prompt, retains intermediate artifacts for transparent debugging
(such as detections, masks, overlays, edited images, and before and after
composites), and provides the same functionality through an interactive UI and
a scriptable CLI for consistent, repeatable runs. We highlight integration
choices that reduce brittleness, including threshold adjustments, mask
inspection with light morphology, and resource-aware defaults. In a small,
single-word prompt segment, detection and segmentation produced usable masks in
over 90% of cases with an accuracy above 85% based on our criteria. On a
high-end GPU, inpainting makes up 60 to 75% of total runtime under typical
guidance and sampling settings, which highlights the need for careful tuning.
The study offers implementation-guided advice on thresholds, mask tightness,
and diffusion parameters, and details version pinning, artifact logging, and
seed control to support replay. Our contribution is a transparent, reliable
pattern for assembling modern vision and multimodal models behind a single
prompt, with clear guardrails and operational practices that improve
reliability in object replacement, scene augmentation, and removal.

Conclusion: 海底物体检测仍面临重大挑战，需要继续研究更有效的解决方案。大型视觉-语言模型为海底检测带来了新的机遇，特别是在合成数据生成和多模态处理方面，但需要进一步研究以充分发挥其潜力并解决实时应用的挑战。

Abstract: Underwater object detection (UOD) is vital to diverse marine applications,
including oceanographic research, underwater robotics, and marine conservation.
However, UOD faces numerous challenges that compromise its performance. Over
the years, various methods have been proposed to address these issues, but they
often fail to fully capture the complexities of underwater environments. This
review systematically categorizes UOD challenges into five key areas: Image
quality degradation, target-related issues, data-related challenges,
computational and processing constraints, and limitations in detection
methodologies. To address these challenges, we analyze the progression from
traditional image processing and object detection techniques to modern
approaches. Additionally, we explore the potential of large vision-language
models (LVLMs) in UOD, leveraging their multi-modal capabilities demonstrated
in other domains. We also present case studies, including synthetic dataset
generation using DALL-E 3 and fine-tuning Florence-2 LVLM for UOD. This review
identifies three key insights: (i) Current UOD methods are insufficient to
fully address challenges like image degradation and small object detection in
dynamic underwater environments. (ii) Synthetic data generation using LVLMs
shows potential for augmenting datasets but requires further refinement to
ensure realism and applicability. (iii) LVLMs hold significant promise for UOD,
but their real-time application remains under-explored, requiring further
research on optimization techniques.

Motivation: 现有视频嵌入对时间变化不敏感，无法有效区分时间上相反的动作对（如开门vs关门），需要开发能够感知视觉时间变化的紧凑视频表示。

Method: 基于感知拉直启发的自编码器，在冻结图像特征序列上使用自监督适应方法，构建具有时间敏感性的潜在空间表示。

Conclusion: 该方法成功构建了紧凑且时间敏感的视频表示，在手性动作识别任务中表现出色，并能增强现有视频模型的性能。

Abstract: Our objective is to develop compact video representations that are sensitive
to visual change over time. To measure such time-sensitivity, we introduce a
new task: chiral action recognition, where one needs to distinguish between a
pair of temporally opposite actions, such as "opening vs. closing a door",
"approaching vs. moving away from something", "folding vs. unfolding paper",
etc. Such actions (i) occur frequently in everyday life, (ii) require
understanding of simple visual change over time (in object state, size, spatial
position, count . . . ), and (iii) are known to be poorly represented by many
video embeddings. Our goal is to build time aware video representations which
offer linear separability between these chiral pairs. To that end, we propose a
self-supervised adaptation recipe to inject time-sensitivity into a sequence of
frozen image features. Our model is based on an auto-encoder with a latent
space with inductive bias inspired by perceptual straightening. We show that
this results in a compact but time-sensitive video representation for the
proposed task across three datasets: Something-Something, EPIC-Kitchens, and
Charade. Our method (i) outperforms much larger video models pre-trained on
large-scale video datasets, and (ii) leads to an improvement in classification
performance on standard benchmarks when combined with these existing models.

Method: 使用问答框架（二元和多项选择），包含目标和陷阱实例，采用自下而上方法评估基本对象、粗到细特征和主体-动作对。

Conclusion: MESH提供了一个有效且全面的视频幻觉识别方法，能够系统评估大型视频模型的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Large Video Models (LVMs) build on the semantic capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) and vision modules by integrating temporal information
to better understand dynamic video content. Despite their progress, LVMs are
prone to hallucinations-producing inaccurate or irrelevant descriptions.
Current benchmarks for video hallucination depend heavily on manual
categorization of video content, neglecting the perception-based processes
through which humans naturally interpret videos. We introduce MESH, a benchmark
designed to evaluate hallucinations in LVMs systematically. MESH uses a
Question-Answering framework with binary and multi-choice formats incorporating
target and trap instances. It follows a bottom-up approach, evaluating basic
objects, coarse-to-fine subject features, and subject-action pairs, aligning
with human video understanding. We demonstrate that MESH offers an effective
and comprehensive approach for identifying hallucinations in videos. Our
evaluations show that while LVMs excel at recognizing basic objects and
features, their susceptibility to hallucinations increases markedly when
handling fine details or aligning multiple actions involving various subjects
in longer videos.

Motivation: 传统单视图分类或回归模型无法全面捐描植物表型特征，影响植物健康评估和收获预测的准确性。多视图数据存在显著重叠和冗余性，需要有效处理方法。

Result: ViewSparsifier方法在ACM Multimedia 2025的GroMo挑战赛中获得了植物年龄预测和叶片计数两个任务的第一名。

Conclusion: 多视图学习组合视图稀疏化策略能够有效提高植物表型分析的准确性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Plant phenotyping involves analyzing observable characteristics of plants to
better understand their growth, health, and development. In the context of deep
learning, this analysis is often approached through single-view classification
or regression models. However, these methods often fail to capture all
information required for accurate estimation of target phenotypic traits, which
can adversely affect plant health assessment and harvest readiness prediction.
To address this, the Growth Modelling (GroMo) Grand Challenge at ACM Multimedia
2025 provides a multi-view dataset featuring multiple plants and two tasks:
Plant Age Prediction and Leaf Count Estimation. Each plant is photographed from
multiple heights and angles, leading to significant overlap and redundancy in
the captured information. To learn view-invariant embeddings, we incorporate 24
views, referred to as the selection vector, in a random selection. Our
ViewSparsifier approach won both tasks. For further improvement and as a
direction for future research, we also experimented with randomized view
selection across all five height levels (120 views total), referred to as
selection matrices.

Conclusion: 多模态特定的策略对于评估模型校准至关重要，MMB为可靠的大规模文本到图像评估提供了有前景的解决方案

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate
text-to-image (TTI) generation systems, providing automated judgments based on
visual and textual context. However, these "judge" models often suffer from
biases, overconfidence, and inconsistent performance across diverse image
domains. While prompt ensembling has shown promise for mitigating these issues
in unimodal, text-only settings, our experiments reveal that standard
ensembling methods fail to generalize effectively for TTI tasks. To address
these limitations, we propose a new multimodal-aware method called Multimodal
Mixture-of-Bayesian Prompt Ensembles (MMB). Our method uses a Bayesian prompt
ensemble approach augmented by image clustering, allowing the judge to
dynamically assign prompt weights based on the visual characteristics of each
sample. We show that MMB improves accuracy in pairwise preference judgments and
greatly enhances calibration, making it easier to gauge the judge's true
uncertainty. In evaluations on two TTI benchmarks, HPSv2 and MJBench, MMB
outperforms existing baselines in alignment with human annotations and
calibration across varied image content. Our findings highlight the importance
of multimodal-specific strategies for judge calibration and suggest a promising
path forward for reliable large-scale TTI evaluation.

textual prompts and fine-grained medical visual features, as well as the
resulting feature dispersion. To address these issues, we revisit the problem
from the perspective of semantic aggregation. Specifically, we propose an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) Aggregation mechanism and a Text-Guided Pixel
Decoder. The former mitigates feature dispersion by dynamically clustering
features into compact semantic centers to enhance cross-modal correspondence.
The latter is designed to bridge the semantic gap by leveraging
domain-invariant textual knowledge to effectively guide deep visual
representations. The synergy between these two mechanisms significantly
improves the model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments on public
cardiac and fundus datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing SOTA approaches across multiple domain generalization
benchmarks.

Conclusion: GraphTopoNet展示了图机器学习如何将稀疏、不确定的地球物理观测转化为大陆尺度的可操作知识，提高了业务建模的可靠性

Abstract: Accurate maps of Greenland's subglacial bed are essential for sea-level
projections, but radar observations are sparse and uneven. We introduce
GraphTopoNet, a graph-learning framework that fuses heterogeneous supervision
and explicitly models uncertainty via Monte Carlo dropout. Spatial graphs built
from surface observables (elevation, velocity, mass balance) are augmented with
gradient features and polynomial trends to capture both local variability and
broad structure. To handle data gaps, we employ a hybrid loss that combines
confidence-weighted radar supervision with dynamically balanced regularization.
Applied to three Greenland subregions, GraphTopoNet outperforms interpolation,
convolutional, and graph-based baselines, reducing error by up to 60 percent
while preserving fine-scale glacial features. The resulting bed maps improve
reliability for operational modeling, supporting agencies engaged in climate
forecasting and policy. More broadly, GraphTopoNet shows how graph machine
learning can convert sparse, uncertain geophysical observations into actionable
knowledge at continental scale.

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to significantly reduce the manual workload
required from medical professionals in complex 3D segmentation tasks that
cannot be yet fully automated. For instance, in radiotherapy planning, organs
at risk must be accurately identified in computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) scans to ensure they are spared from harmful radiation.
Similarly, diagnosing age-related degenerative diseases such as sarcopenia,
which involve progressive muscle volume loss and strength, is commonly based on
muscular mass measurements often obtained from manual segmentation of medical
volumes. To alleviate the manual-segmentation burden, this paper introduces an
implicit shape prior to segment volumes from sparse slice manual annotations
generalized to the multi-organ case, along with a simple framework for
automatically selecting the most informative slices to guide and minimize the
next interactions. The experimental validation shows the method's effectiveness
on two medical use cases: assisted segmentation in the context of at risks
organs for brain cancer patients, and acceleration of the creation of a new
database with unseen muscle shapes for patients with sarcopenia.

Abstract: With imaging devices delivering ever-higher resolutions and the emerging
diffusion-based forgery methods, current detectors trained only on traditional
datasets (with splicing, copy-moving and object removal forgeries) lack
exposure to this new manipulation type. To address this, we propose a novel
high-resolution SIF dataset of 1200+ diffusion-generated manipulations with
semantically extracted masks. However, this also imposes a challenge on
existing methods, as they face significant computational resource constraints
due to their prohibitive computational complexities. Therefore, we propose a
novel EfficientIML model with a lightweight, three-stage EfficientRWKV
backbone. EfficientRWKV's hybrid state-space and attention network captures
global context and local details in parallel, while a multi-scale supervision
strategy enforces consistency across hierarchical predictions. Extensive
evaluations on our dataset and standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach outperforms ViT-based and other SOTA lightweight baselines in
localization performance, FLOPs and inference speed, underscoring its
suitability for real-time forensic applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model
(SAM), have significantly impacted medical image segmentation, especially in
retinal imaging, where precise segmentation is vital for diagnosis. Despite
this progress, current methods face critical challenges: 1) modality ambiguity
in textual disease descriptions, 2) a continued reliance on manual prompting
for SAM-based workflows, and 3) a lack of a unified framework, with most
methods being modality- and task-specific. To overcome these hurdles, we
propose CLIP-unified Auto-Prompt Segmentation (\CLAPS), a novel method for
unified segmentation across diverse tasks and modalities in retinal imaging.
Our approach begins by pre-training a CLIP-based image encoder on a large,
multi-modal retinal dataset to handle data scarcity and distribution imbalance.
We then leverage GroundingDINO to automatically generate spatial bounding box
prompts by detecting local lesions. To unify tasks and resolve ambiguity, we
use text prompts enhanced with a unique "modality signature" for each imaging
modality. Ultimately, these automated textual and spatial prompts guide SAM to
execute precise segmentation, creating a fully automated and unified pipeline.
Extensive experiments on 12 diverse datasets across 11 critical segmentation
categories show that CLAPS achieves performance on par with specialized expert
models while surpassing existing benchmarks across most metrics, demonstrating
its broad generalizability as a foundation model.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have taken a great step towards AGI. Meanwhile,
an increasing number of domain-specific problems such as math and programming
boost these general-purpose models to continuously evolve via learning deeper
expertise. Now is thus the time further to extend the diversity of specialized
applications for knowledgeable LLMs, though collecting high quality data with
unexpected and informative tasks is challenging. In this paper, we propose to
use advertisement (ad) videos as a challenging test-bed to probe the ability of
LLMs in perceiving beyond the objective physical content of common visual
domain. Our motivation is to take full advantage of the clue-rich and
information-dense ad videos' traits, e.g., marketing logic, persuasive
strategies, and audience engagement. Our contribution is three-fold: (1) To our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to use ad videos with well-designed tasks
to evaluate LLMs. We contribute AdsQA, a challenging ad Video QA benchmark
derived from 1,544 ad videos with 10,962 clips, totaling 22.7 hours, providing
5 challenging tasks. (2) We propose ReAd-R, a Deepseek-R1 styled RL model that
reflects on questions, and generates answers via reward-driven optimization.
(3) We benchmark 14 top-tier LLMs on AdsQA, and our \texttt{ReAd-R}~achieves
the state-of-the-art outperforming strong competitors equipped with long-chain
reasoning capabilities by a clear margin.

Motivation: 多模态眼科图像诊断中，配对数据获取成本高，OCT数据稀缺且模态不平衡。传统方法仅使用眼底或文本特征无法捕捉细粒度空间信息

Method: 通过对比学习在未配对的OCT和眼底图像上学习病灶偏好位点矩阵，在OCT潜在空间中捕获病变定位模式，然后利用该矩阵辅助仅基于眼底图像的分类任务

Result: 在9个不同数据集、28个关键类别上的实验表明，该框架优于现有基准方法

Conclusion: 提出的无配对多模态框架成功利用OCT空间先验知识，显著提升了仅基于眼底图像的疾病识别性能

Abstract: Significant advancements in AI-driven multimodal medical image diagnosis have
led to substantial improvements in ophthalmic disease identification in recent
years. However, acquiring paired multimodal ophthalmic images remains
prohibitively expensive. While fundus photography is simple and cost-effective,
the limited availability of OCT data and inherent modality imbalance hinder
further progress. Conventional approaches that rely solely on fundus or textual
features often fail to capture fine-grained spatial information, as each
imaging modality provides distinct cues about lesion predilection sites. In
this study, we propose a novel unpaired multimodal framework \UOPSL that
utilizes extensive OCT-derived spatial priors to dynamically identify
predilection sites, enhancing fundus image-based disease recognition. Our
approach bridges unpaired fundus and OCTs via extended disease text
descriptions. Initially, we employ contrastive learning on a large corpus of
unpaired OCT and fundus images while simultaneously learning the predilection
sites matrix in the OCT latent space. Through extensive optimization, this
matrix captures lesion localization patterns within the OCT feature space.
During the fine-tuning or inference phase of the downstream classification task
based solely on fundus images, where paired OCT data is unavailable, we
eliminate OCT input and utilize the predilection sites matrix to assist in
fundus image classification learning. Extensive experiments conducted on 9
diverse datasets across 28 critical categories demonstrate that our framework
outperforms existing benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决扩散模型在数据稀缺领域面临的挑战，避免完全重新训练或需要大量配对数据的成本问题，提供更可控和高效的跨域转换方案。

Method: 通过在共享潜在空间中对齐源域和目标域分布，将预训练的源域扩散模型与目标域潜在对齐扩散模型（LADM）集成，利用部分配对的潜在表示进行训练，实现确定性域映射。

Result: 在部分监督下的深度到图像转换任务中表现出优越性能，能够处理多源转换（深度图和分割掩码）和多目标转换（类条件风格迁移），展示出处理多样化异构用例的灵活性。

Conclusion: LADB为现实世界域转换提供了一个可扩展且通用的解决方案，特别适用于数据标注成本高或不完整的场景，在保真度和多样性之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating high-quality outputs but face challenges
in data-scarce domains, where exhaustive retraining or costly paired data are
often required. To address these limitations, we propose Latent Aligned
Diffusion Bridges (LADB), a semi-supervised framework for sample-to-sample
translation that effectively bridges domain gaps using partially paired data.
By aligning source and target distributions within a shared latent space, LADB
seamlessly integrates pretrained source-domain diffusion models with a
target-domain Latent Aligned Diffusion Model (LADM), trained on partially
paired latent representations. This approach enables deterministic domain
mapping without the need for full supervision. Compared to unpaired methods,
which often lack controllability, and fully paired approaches that require
large, domain-specific datasets, LADB strikes a balance between fidelity and
diversity by leveraging a mixture of paired and unpaired latent-target
couplings. Our experimental results demonstrate superior performance in
depth-to-image translation under partial supervision. Furthermore, we extend
LADB to handle multi-source translation (from depth maps and segmentation
masks) and multi-target translation in a class-conditioned style transfer task,
showcasing its versatility in handling diverse and heterogeneous use cases.
Ultimately, we present LADB as a scalable and versatile solution for real-world
domain translation, particularly in scenarios where data annotation is costly
or incomplete.

Conclusion: DSLNet通过解耦和分别建模手势形态和轨迹，有效解决了孤立手语识别中的几何模糊性问题，实现了新的最先进性能

Abstract: Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) is challenged by gestures that are
morphologically similar yet semantically distinct, a problem rooted in the
complex interplay between hand shape and motion trajectory. Existing methods,
often relying on a single reference frame, struggle to resolve this geometric
ambiguity. This paper introduces Dual-SignLanguageNet (DSLNet), a
dual-reference, dual-stream architecture that decouples and models gesture
morphology and trajectory in separate, complementary coordinate systems. Our
approach utilizes a wrist-centric frame for view-invariant shape analysis and a
facial-centric frame for context-aware trajectory modeling. These streams are
processed by specialized networks-a topology-aware graph convolution for shape
and a Finsler geometry-based encoder for trajectory-and are integrated via a
geometry-driven optimal transport fusion mechanism. DSLNet sets a new
state-of-the-art, achieving 93.70%, 89.97% and 99.79% accuracy on the
challenging WLASL-100, WLASL-300 and LSA64 datasets, respectively, with
significantly fewer parameters than competing models.

Method: 采用分形变形网络(FDN)架构，基于分形几何和自相似性的递归编码器-解码器结构，结合L1/L2数据保真度和总变差正则化的变分能量函数进行训练。

Result: 在合成和基准数据集上实验表明，该方法能够生成准确、平滑且保持边缘细节的光流场，特别适用于高分辨率数据和标注有限的场景。

Conclusion: FractalPINN-Flow成功实现了无监督光流估计，分形网络结构有效捕获了细粒度细节和长距离运动模式，TV正则化确保了空间平滑性和一致性。

Abstract: We present FractalPINN-Flow, an unsupervised deep learning framework for
dense optical flow estimation that learns directly from consecutive grayscale
frames without requiring ground truth. The architecture centers on the Fractal
Deformation Network (FDN) - a recursive encoder-decoder inspired by fractal
geometry and self-similarity. Unlike traditional CNNs with sequential
downsampling, FDN uses repeated encoder-decoder nesting with skip connections
to capture both fine-grained details and long-range motion patterns. The
training objective is based on a classical variational formulation using total
variation (TV) regularization. Specifically, we minimize an energy functional
that combines $L^1$ and $L^2$ data fidelity terms to enforce brightness
constancy, along with a TV term that promotes spatial smoothness and coherent
flow fields. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets show that
FractalPINN-Flow produces accurate, smooth, and edge-preserving optical flow
fields. The model is especially effective for high-resolution data and
scenarios with limited annotations.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive survey of computational imaging (CI)
techniques and their transformative impact on computer vision (CV)
applications. Conventional imaging methods often fail to deliver high-fidelity
visual data in challenging conditions, such as low light, motion blur, or high

analyzing the relationships between CI methods and their practical
contributions to CV applications, this work highlights emerging opportunities,

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) advance, their large-scale
architectures pose challenges for deployment in resource-constrained
environments. In the age of large models, where energy efficiency,
computational scalability and environmental sustainability are paramount, the
development of lightweight and high-performance models is critical for
real-world applications. As such, we propose a lightweight MLLM framework for
end-to-end visual question answering. Our proposed approach centres on
BreezeCLIP, a compact yet powerful vision-language encoder optimised for
efficient multimodal understanding. With only 1.2 billion parameters overall,
our model significantly reduces computational cost while achieving performance
comparable to standard-size MLLMs. Experiments conducted on multiple datasets
further validate its effectiveness in balancing accuracy and efficiency. The
modular and extensible design enables generalisation to broader multimodal
tasks. The proposed lightweight vision-language framework is denoted as BcQLM
(BreezeCLIP-enhanced Q-Gated Multimodal Language Model). It offers a promising
path toward deployable MLLMs under practical hardware constraints. The source

Conclusion: CQ方法通过嵌入密度信息有效提升了transformer检测器在拢挤场景中的表现，是首个能够有效联通2D和3D检测的方法，具有良好的普适性和扩展性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for end-to-end crowd detection that
leverages object density information to enhance existing transformer-based
detectors. We present CrowdQuery (CQ), whose core component is our CQ module
that predicts and subsequently embeds an object density map. The embedded
density information is then systematically integrated into the decoder.
Existing density map definitions typically depend on head positions or
object-based spatial statistics. Our method extends these definitions to
include individual bounding box dimensions. By incorporating density
information into object queries, our method utilizes density-guided queries to
improve detection in crowded scenes. CQ is universally applicable to both 2D
and 3D detection without requiring additional data. Consequently, we are the
first to design a method that effectively bridges 2D and 3D detection in
crowded environments. We demonstrate the integration of CQ into both a general
2D and 3D transformer-based object detector, introducing the architectures CQ2D
and CQ3D. CQ is not limited to the specific transformer models we selected.
Experiments on the STCrowd dataset for both 2D and 3D domains show significant
performance improvements compared to the base models, outperforming most
state-of-the-art methods. When integrated into a state-of-the-art crowd
detector, CQ can further improve performance on the challenging CrowdHuman
dataset, demonstrating its generalizability. The code is released at

Method: 采用双射映射框架，将大规模修改分解为地图元素级的细粒度原子变化，确保可解释性，实现精确的变化检测和集成。

Result: 实验表明，在ArgoTweak上训练的模型相比合成先验显著减少了sim2real差距，消融实验进一步验证了结构化先验和详细变化标注的重要性。

Conclusion: ArgoTweak为可解释的先验辅助高精地图建立了基准，推动了可扩展、自改进的地图解决方案发展。

Abstract: Reliable integration of prior information is crucial for self-verifying and
self-updating HD maps. However, no public dataset includes the required triplet
of prior maps, current maps, and sensor data. As a result, existing methods
must rely on synthetic priors, which create inconsistencies and lead to a
significant sim2real gap. To address this, we introduce ArgoTweak, the first
dataset to complete the triplet with realistic map priors. At its core,
ArgoTweak employs a bijective mapping framework, breaking down large-scale
modifications into fine-grained atomic changes at the map element level, thus
ensuring interpretability. This paradigm shift enables accurate change
detection and integration while preserving unchanged elements with high
fidelity. Experiments show that training models on ArgoTweak significantly
reduces the sim2real gap compared to synthetic priors. Extensive ablations
further highlight the impact of structured priors and detailed change
annotations. By establishing a benchmark for explainable, prior-aided HD
mapping, ArgoTweak advances scalable, self-improving mapping solutions. The
dataset, baselines, map modification toolbox, and further resources are
available at https://kth-rpl.github.io/ArgoTweak/.

TL;DR: 使用移动手机拍摄的皮肤图像，基于Transformer模型的深度学习框架能够实现高精度的碳中毒症自动诊断，准确率达86%，具有良好的可解释性和部署可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 碳中毒症在南亚和东南亚地区是严重公共卫生问题，早期皮肤表现容易误诊。农村地区缺乏皮肤科医生，需要自动化的图像诊断方案来支持早期发现和及时干预。

Method: 构建包含20个类别、11000张图片的数据集，对比评测卷秩神经网络和Transformer模型。集成LIME和Grad-CAM可解释性技术，并开发了网页基础的诊断工具。

Result: Transformer模型显著超过CNN，Swin Transformer达到最佳效果，51准确率86%。可解释性可视化确认模型关注病变区域，外部验证表现良好。

Conclusion: 该框架证明了深度学习在碳中毒症无侵入性、可访问和可解释诊断中的潜力。在资源有限的农村社区可作为实用的诊断辅助工具，支持早期发现和及时干预。

Abstract: Background: Arsenicosis is a serious public health concern in South and
Southeast Asia, primarily caused by long-term consumption of
arsenic-contaminated water. Its early cutaneous manifestations are clinically
significant but often underdiagnosed, particularly in rural areas with limited
access to dermatologists. Automated, image-based diagnostic solutions can
support early detection and timely interventions.
  Methods: In this study, we propose an end-to-end framework for arsenicosis
diagnosis using mobile phone-captured skin images. A dataset comprising 20
classes and over 11000 images of arsenic-induced and other dermatological
conditions was curated. Multiple deep learning architectures, including
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models, were
benchmarked for arsenicosis detection. Model interpretability was integrated
via LIME and Grad-CAM, while deployment feasibility was demonstrated through a
web-based diagnostic tool.
  Results: Transformer-based models significantly outperformed CNNs, with the
Swin Transformer achieving the best results (86\\% accuracy). LIME and Grad-CAM
visualizations confirmed that the models attended to lesion-relevant regions,
increasing clinical transparency and aiding in error analysis. The framework
also demonstrated strong performance on external validation samples, confirming
its ability to generalize beyond the curated dataset.
  Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of deep
learning for non-invasive, accessible, and explainable diagnosis of arsenicosis
from mobile-acquired images. By enabling reliable image-based screening, it can
serve as a practical diagnostic aid in rural and resource-limited communities,
where access to dermatologists is scarce, thereby supporting early detection
and timely intervention.

Motivation: 解决事件相机在星迹踪应用中缺乏准确真实值的问题，为低成本低延迟的定向系统提供验证方法

Method: 将静止事件相机通过地面望远镜指向夜空，使得相机在天球参考系中的运动只由地球自转引起，将事件数据流处理生成方向估计并与IERS测量值进行对比

Result: 系统达到了18.47秒的均方根锐差精度和78.84秒的绝对锐差精度，结合事件相机的低计算量、高动态范围、低能耗和快更新率优势

Conclusion: 事件相机在低成本低延迟的星迹踪应用中具有实用性，为太空定向系统提供了一种有效的解决方案

Abstract: Event-based cameras (EBCs) are a promising new technology for star
tracking-based attitude determination, but prior studies have struggled to
determine accurate ground truth for real data. We analyze the accuracy of an
EBC star tracking system utilizing the Earth's motion as the ground truth for
comparison. The Earth rotates in a regular way with very small irregularities
which are measured to the level of milli-arcseconds. By keeping an event camera
static and pointing it through a ground-based telescope at the night sky, we
create a system where the only camera motion in the celestial reference frame
is that induced by the Earth's rotation. The resulting event stream is
processed to generate estimates of orientation which we compare to the
International Earth Rotation and Reference System (IERS) measured orientation
of the Earth. The event camera system is able to achieve a root mean squared
across error of 18.47 arcseconds and an about error of 78.84 arcseconds.
Combined with the other benefits of event cameras over framing sensors (reduced
computation due to sparser data streams, higher dynamic range, lower energy
consumption, faster update rates), this level of accuracy suggests the utility
of event cameras for low-cost and low-latency star tracking. We provide all
code and data used to generate our results:

TL;DR: BEAMER是一种新颖的密集图像匹配架构，通过在每个尺度为每个源位置预测多个对应假设，而不是单一假设，显著提高了在深度不连续和强缩放情况下的匹配鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在每个尺度为每个源位置只产生单一对应假设，在深度不连续或目标图像是源图像的强缩放时，相邻源位置的对应点可能分布广泛，导致错误匹配。

Method: 采用波束搜索策略在每个尺度传播多个假设，并将这些多假设集成到交叉注意力层中，构建BEAMER架构来学习和传播多假设跨尺度。

Result: BEAMER比最先进方法显著更鲁棒，特别是在深度不连续和目标图像是源图像强缩放的情况下。

Conclusion: 预测多个对应假设而非单一假设的策略能有效提升密集图像匹配在挑战性场景下的性能。

Abstract: Dense image matching aims to find a correspondent for every pixel of a source
image in a partially overlapping target image. State-of-the-art methods
typically rely on a coarse-to-fine mechanism where a single correspondent
hypothesis is produced per source location at each scale. In challenging cases
-- such as at depth discontinuities or when the target image is a strong
zoom-in of the source image -- the correspondents of neighboring source
locations are often widely spread and predicting a single correspondent
hypothesis per source location at each scale may lead to erroneous matches. In
this paper, we investigate the idea of predicting multiple correspondent
hypotheses per source location at each scale instead. We consider a beam search
strategy to propagat multiple hypotheses at each scale and propose integrating
these multiple hypotheses into cross-attention layers, resulting in a novel
dense matching architecture called BEAMER. BEAMER learns to preserve and
propagate multiple hypotheses across scales, making it significantly more
robust than state-of-the-art methods, especially at depth discontinuities or
when the target image is a strong zoom-in of the source image.

Motivation: 现有的生成模型基准主要关注图像生成，而视频生成具有独特的时空复杂性，缺乏系统性的评估基准来识别和解决视频生成中的伪影问题

Method: 构建大规模人工标注数据集GeneVA，专注于从自然文本提示生成的视频中的时空伪影，包括物理不可能性和时间不一致性等问题

Result: 创建了一个专门针对视频生成伪影的大规模标注数据集，为系统评估生成视频质量提供了重要资源

Conclusion: GeneVA数据集能够支持关键应用，如模型性能基准测试和生成视频质量改进，填补了视频生成评估领域的空白

Abstract: Recent advances in probabilistic generative models have extended capabilities
from static image synthesis to text-driven video generation. However, the
inherent randomness of their generation process can lead to unpredictable
artifacts, such as impossible physics and temporal inconsistency. Progress in
addressing these challenges requires systematic benchmarks, yet existing
datasets primarily focus on generative images due to the unique spatio-temporal
complexities of videos. To bridge this gap, we introduce GeneVA, a large-scale
artifact dataset with rich human annotations that focuses on spatio-temporal
artifacts in videos generated from natural text prompts. We hope GeneVA can
enable and assist critical applications, such as benchmarking model performance
and improving generative video quality.

TL;DR: RewardDance是一个可扩展的视觉生成奖励建模框架，通过生成式奖励范式解决现有方法的局限性，支持模型规模扩展到260亿参数，并有效解决了奖励黑客问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉生成奖励模型存在根本性限制：CLIP-based方法受架构和输入模态约束，Bradley-Terry损失与VLMs的next-token预测机制不匹配，且RLHF优化过程存在奖励黑客问题。

Method: 提出RewardDance框架，将奖励分数重新定义为模型预测"yes"标记的概率，表示生成图像在特定标准下优于参考图像，从而内在对齐奖励目标与VLM架构。

Result: RewardDance在文本到图像、文本到视频和图像到视频生成任务中显著超越最先进方法，大规模RM在RL微调期间表现出高奖励方差，证明其抗黑客攻击能力。

Conclusion: 该框架通过模型规模扩展和上下文扩展两个维度实现可扩展性，有效缓解了小模型中普遍存在的模式崩溃问题，为视觉生成奖励建模提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are critical for improving generation models via
Reinforcement Learning (RL), yet the RM scaling paradigm in visual generation
remains largely unexplored. It primarily due to fundamental limitations in
existing approaches: CLIP-based RMs suffer from architectural and input
modality constraints, while prevalent Bradley-Terry losses are fundamentally
misaligned with the next-token prediction mechanism of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), hindering effective scaling. More critically, the RLHF optimization
process is plagued by Reward Hacking issue, where models exploit flaws in the
reward signal without improving true quality. To address these challenges, we
introduce RewardDance, a scalable reward modeling framework that overcomes
these barriers through a novel generative reward paradigm. By reformulating the
reward score as the model's probability of predicting a "yes" token, indicating
that the generated image outperforms a reference image according to specific
criteria, RewardDance intrinsically aligns reward objectives with VLM
architectures. This alignment unlocks scaling across two dimensions: (1) Model
Scaling: Systematic scaling of RMs up to 26 billion parameters; (2) Context
Scaling: Integration of task-specific instructions, reference examples, and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
RewardDance significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods in text-to-image,
text-to-video, and image-to-video generation. Crucially, we resolve the
persistent challenge of "reward hacking": Our large-scale RMs exhibit and
maintain high reward variance during RL fine-tuning, proving their resistance
to hacking and ability to produce diverse, high-quality outputs. It greatly
relieves the mode collapse problem that plagues smaller models.

Conclusion: 该方法在单目视频的织物动态场景重建方面取得了显著改进，同时实现了高质量的外观估计

Abstract: The reconstruction of three-dimensional dynamic scenes is a well-established
yet challenging task within the domain of computer vision. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach that combines the domains of 3D geometry
reconstruction and appearance estimation for physically based rendering and
present a system that is able to perform both tasks for fabrics, utilizing only
a single monocular RGB video sequence as input. In order to obtain realistic
and high-quality deformations and renderings, a physical simulation of the
cloth geometry and differentiable rendering are employed. In this paper, we
introduce two novel regularization terms for the 3D reconstruction task that
improve the plausibility of the reconstruction by addressing the depth
ambiguity problem in monocular video. In comparison with the most recent
methods in the field, we have reduced the error in the 3D reconstruction by a
factor of 2.64 while requiring a medium runtime of 30 min per scene.
Furthermore, the optimized motion achieves sufficient quality to perform an
appearance estimation of the deforming object, recovering sharp details from
this single monocular RGB video.

Abstract: Speech Relation Extraction (SpeechRE) aims to extract relation triplets
directly from speech. However, existing benchmark datasets rely heavily on
synthetic data, lacking sufficient quantity and diversity of real human speech.
Moreover, existing models also suffer from rigid single-order generation
templates and weak semantic alignment, substantially limiting their
performance. To address these challenges, we introduce CommonVoice-SpeechRE, a
large-scale dataset comprising nearly 20,000 real-human speech samples from
diverse speakers, establishing a new benchmark for SpeechRE research.
Furthermore, we propose the Relation Prompt-Guided Multi-Order Generative
Ensemble (RPG-MoGe), a novel framework that features: (1) a multi-order triplet
generation ensemble strategy, leveraging data diversity through diverse element
orders during both training and inference, and (2) CNN-based latent relation
prediction heads that generate explicit relation prompts to guide cross-modal
alignment and accurate triplet generation. Experiments show our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing both a benchmark dataset and an
effective solution for real-world SpeechRE. The source code and dataset are
publicly available at https://github.com/NingJinzhong/SpeechRE_RPG_MoGe.

Abstract: Language identification is the task of determining the languages for a given
text. In many real world scenarios, text may contain more than one language,
particularly in multilingual communities. Bilingual Language Identification
(BLID) is the task of identifying and distinguishing between two languages in a
given text. This paper presents BLID for languages spoken in the southern part
of Ethiopia, namely Wolaita and Gofa. The presence of words similarities and
differences between the two languages makes the language identification task
challenging. To overcome this challenge, we employed various experiments on
various approaches. Then, the combination of the BERT based pretrained language
model and LSTM approach performed better, with an F1 score of 0.72 on the test
set. As a result, the work will be effective in tackling unwanted social media
issues and providing a foundation for further research in this area.

Conclusion: AntiDote提供了一种实用且计算高效的方法，使开源权重模型的安全性成为更内在和弹性的属性

Abstract: The release of open-weight large language models (LLMs) creates a tension
between advancing accessible research and preventing misuse, such as malicious
fine-tuning to elicit harmful content. Current safety measures struggle to
preserve the general capabilities of the LLM while resisting a determined
adversary with full access to the model's weights and architecture, who can use
full-parameter fine-tuning to erase existing safeguards. To address this, we
introduce AntiDote, a bi-level optimization procedure for training LLMs to be
resistant to such tampering. AntiDote involves an auxiliary adversary
hypernetwork that learns to generate malicious Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
weights conditioned on the defender model's internal activations. The defender
LLM is then trained with an objective to nullify the effect of these
adversarial weight additions, forcing it to maintain its safety alignment. We
validate this approach against a diverse suite of 52 red-teaming attacks,
including jailbreak prompting, latent space manipulation, and direct
weight-space attacks. AntiDote is upto 27.4\% more robust against adversarial
attacks compared to both tamper-resistance and unlearning baselines. Crucially,
this robustness is achieved with a minimal trade-off in utility, incurring a
performance degradation of upto less than 0.5\% across capability benchmarks
including MMLU, HellaSwag, and GSM8K. Our work offers a practical and compute
efficient methodology for building open-weight models where safety is a more
integral and resilient property.

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values is critical
for their safe and effective deployment across diverse user populations.
However, existing benchmarks often neglect cultural and demographic diversity,
leading to limited understanding of how value alignment generalizes globally.
In this work, we introduce MVPBench, a novel benchmark that systematically
evaluates LLMs' alignment with multi-dimensional human value preferences across
75 countries. MVPBench contains 24,020 high-quality instances annotated with
fine-grained value labels, personalized questions, and rich demographic
metadata, making it the most comprehensive resource of its kind to date. Using
MVPBench, we conduct an in-depth analysis of several state-of-the-art LLMs,
revealing substantial disparities in alignment performance across geographic
and demographic lines. We further demonstrate that lightweight fine-tuning
methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO), can significantly enhance value alignment in both in-domain and
out-of-domain settings. Our findings underscore the necessity for
population-aware alignment evaluation and provide actionable insights for
building culturally adaptive and value-sensitive LLMs. MVPBench serves as a
practical foundation for future research on global alignment, personalized

Abstract: Scientific literature is growing exponentially, creating a critical
bottleneck for researchers to efficiently synthesize knowledge. While
general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential in text processing,
they often fail to capture scientific domain-specific nuances (e.g., technical
jargon, methodological rigor) and struggle with complex scientific tasks,
limiting their utility for interdisciplinary research. To address these gaps,
this paper presents SciGPT, a domain-adapted foundation model for scientific
literature understanding and ScienceBench, an open source benchmark tailored to
evaluate scientific LLMs.
  Built on the Qwen3 architecture, SciGPT incorporates three key innovations:
(1) low-cost domain distillation via a two-stage pipeline to balance
performance and efficiency; (2) a Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) attention
mechanism that cuts memory consumption by 55\% for 32,000-token long-document
reasoning; and (3) knowledge-aware adaptation integrating domain ontologies to
bridge interdisciplinary knowledge gaps.
  Experimental results on ScienceBench show that SciGPT outperforms GPT-4o in
core scientific tasks including sequence labeling, generation, and inference.
It also exhibits strong robustness in unseen scientific tasks, validating its
potential to facilitate AI-augmented scientific discovery.

Motivation: 大型语言模型个性化可能带来意外副作用，特别是人物设定提示可能导致模型错误拒绝用户请求，但缺乏对此问题的量化研究

Method: 使用15种社会人口统计人物设定、16个不同模型、3种任务类型和9种提示变体进行测试，提出基于蒙特卡洛的方法来高效量化问题

Result: 模型能力越强，人物设定对拒绝率的影响越小；某些社会人口统计人物设定会增加虚假拒绝，但模型选择和任务类型对虚假拒绝的影响更大，特别是在敏感内容任务中

Conclusion: 人物设定效应可能被高估，虚假拒绝更多受到模型能力和任务类型的影响，而非人物设定本身

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into our daily lives
and personalized. However, LLM personalization might also increase unintended
side effects. Recent work suggests that persona prompting can lead models to
falsely refuse user requests. However, no work has fully quantified the extent
of this issue. To address this gap, we measure the impact of 15
sociodemographic personas (based on gender, race, religion, and disability) on
false refusal. To control for other factors, we also test 16 different models,
3 tasks (Natural Language Inference, politeness, and offensiveness
classification), and nine prompt paraphrases. We propose a Monte Carlo-based
method to quantify this issue in a sample-efficient manner. Our results show
that as models become more capable, personas impact the refusal rate less and
less. Certain sociodemographic personas increase false refusal in some models,
which suggests underlying biases in the alignment strategies or safety
mechanisms. However, we find that the model choice and task significantly
influence false refusals, especially in sensitive content tasks. Our findings
suggest that persona effects have been overestimated, and might be due to other

TL;DR: 大语言模型能够通过信息瓶颈原理进化出高效的人类语义系统，在颜色命名领域与人类表现出高度一致性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型是否能够像人类语言一样，通过信息瓶颈原理进化出高效压缩的语义分类系统

Method: 使用Gemini 2.0-flash和Llama 3.3-70B-Instruct模型，重现两个重要人类行为实验：1）英语颜色命名研究；2）通过上下文语言学习模拟伪颜色命名系统的文化进化

Result: Gemini与英语本土语者命名模式高度一致且获得高IB效率分数；Llama展现低复杂性但效率的系统；两模型都能通过迭代学习将随机系统重构为更高IB效率的系统，与世界各语言模式增加一致性

Conclusion: LLMs能够像人类一样，在感知基础上通过信息瓶颈原理进化出高效的人类语义系统，证明了这种基本原理在人类语言和AI模型中的普遍性

Abstract: Converging evidence suggests that systems of semantic categories across human
languages achieve near-optimal compression via the Information Bottleneck (IB)
complexity-accuracy principle. Large language models (LLMs) are not trained for
this objective, which raises the question: are LLMs capable of evolving
efficient human-like semantic systems? To address this question, we focus on
the domain of color as a key testbed of cognitive theories of categorization
and replicate with LLMs (Gemini 2.0-flash and Llama 3.3-70B-Instruct) two
influential human behavioral studies. First, we conduct an English color-naming
study, showing that Gemini aligns well with the naming patterns of native
English speakers and achieves a significantly high IB-efficiency score, while
Llama exhibits an efficient but lower complexity system compared to English.
Second, to test whether LLMs simply mimic patterns in their training data or
actually exhibit a human-like inductive bias toward IB-efficiency, we simulate
cultural evolution of pseudo color-naming systems in LLMs via iterated
in-context language learning. We find that akin to humans, LLMs iteratively
restructure initially random systems towards greater IB-efficiency and
increased alignment with patterns observed across the world's languages. These
findings demonstrate that LLMs are capable of evolving perceptually grounded,
human-like semantic systems, driven by the same fundamental principle that
governs semantic efficiency across human languages.

TL;DR: MERLIN是一个两阶段模型堆叠框架，通过课程学习策略（从通用双语文本到任务特定数据）和仅适配少量DoRA权重，显著提升了低资源语言的复杂推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有编码器-解码器方法在中等和高资源语言上表现良好，但在低资源语言上仍存在较大差距，需要提升低资源语言的复杂推理能力。

Method: 采用两阶段模型堆叠框架，应用课程学习策略（从通用双语文本到任务特定数据），仅适配少量DoRA权重。

Result: 在AfriMGSM基准测试中准确率比MindMerger提升12.9个百分点，优于GPT-4o-mini；在MGSM和MSVAMP上也分别获得0.9和2.8个百分点的稳定提升。

Conclusion: MERLIN框架在低资源和高资源环境下都表现出有效性，显著提升了低资源语言的复杂推理性能。

Abstract: Large language models excel in English but still struggle with complex
reasoning in many low-resource languages (LRLs). Existing encoder-plus-decoder
methods such as LangBridge and MindMerger raise accuracy on mid and
high-resource languages, yet they leave a large gap on LRLs. We present MERLIN,
a two-stage model-stacking framework that applies a curriculum learning
strategy -- from general bilingual bitext to task-specific data -- and adapts
only a small set of DoRA weights. On the AfriMGSM benchmark MERLIN improves
exact-match accuracy by +12.9 pp over MindMerger and outperforms GPT-4o-mini.
It also yields consistent gains on MGSM and MSVAMP (+0.9 and +2.8 pp),
demonstrating effectiveness across both low and high-resource settings.

TL;DR: 研究发现大语言模型的偏见通过提示调整后仍然会转移，现有的提示去偏方法无法一致防止偏见传播


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 证明偏见转移假设false assumption，提醒研究界关注提示调整下的偏见传播问题

Method: 在因果模型中研究提示适配下的偏见转移，测量内在偏见与适配后偏见的相关性，评估多种提示去偏策略

Result: 偏见在性别(ρ >= 0.94)、年龄(ρ >= 0.98)、宗教(ρ >= 0.69)等方面保持强相关，少样本参数变化下仍有ρ >= 0.90的相关性，现有去偏方法无法一致降低偏见传播

Conclusion: 必须在源头模型中美正偏见才能有效防止偏见向下游任务传播

Abstract: A dangerous assumption that can be made from prior work on the bias transfer
hypothesis (BTH) is that biases do not transfer from pre-trained large language
models (LLMs) to adapted models. We invalidate this assumption by studying the
BTH in causal models under prompt adaptations, as prompting is an extremely
popular and accessible adaptation strategy used in real-world applications. In
contrast to prior work, we find that biases can transfer through prompting and
that popular prompt-based mitigation methods do not consistently prevent biases
from transferring. Specifically, the correlation between intrinsic biases and
those after prompt adaptation remain moderate to strong across demographics and
tasks -- for example, gender (rho >= 0.94) in co-reference resolution, and age
(rho >= 0.98) and religion (rho >= 0.69) in question answering. Further, we
find that biases remain strongly correlated when varying few-shot composition
parameters, such as sample size, stereotypical content, occupational
distribution and representational balance (rho >= 0.90). We evaluate several
prompt-based debiasing strategies and find that different approaches have
distinct strengths, but none consistently reduce bias transfer across models,
tasks or demographics. These results demonstrate that correcting bias, and
potentially improving reasoning ability, in intrinsic models may prevent
propagation of biases to downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的一次性查询LLM方式不可靠，希望通过分解任务为简单操作来提升LLM在推理任务中的可靠性

Method: 使用经典算法（如双调排序网络）作为框架，将LLM作为二元比较器使用，限制LLM只执行简单的自然语言字符串操作

Result: 在排序和聚类任务上验证了该方法的有效性

Conclusion: verbalized algorithms方法通过结合经典算法理论和LLM的自然语言处理能力，能够可靠地完成复杂推理任务

Abstract: Instead of querying LLMs in a one-shot manner and hoping to get the right
answer for a reasoning task, we propose a paradigm we call \emph{verbalized
algorithms} (VAs), which leverage classical algorithms with established
theoretical understanding. VAs decompose a task into simple elementary
operations on natural language strings that they should be able to answer
reliably, and limit the scope of LLMs to only those simple tasks. For example,
for sorting a series of natural language strings, \emph{verbalized sorting}
uses an LLM as a binary comparison oracle in a known and well-analyzed sorting
algorithm (e.g., bitonic sorting network). We demonstrate the effectiveness of
this approach on sorting and clustering tasks.

Motivation: 识别如何在主观标注任务中平衡标注者可靠性和标签多样性的保留，避免现有方法将不同意见视为垃圾而删除。

Method: 通过实验评估多种标注者过滤惯例方法对主观任务标签变异性的影响，使用合成垃圾数据分析标注者行为特征。

Result: 现有方法多数情况下会删除正常不同意见者，导致标签多样性损失。保守设置（5%以下删除率）效果最好。真实垃圾标注者通常更不随机，给出固定答案。

Conclusion: 主观标注任务需要新的垃圾过滤方法，考虑标签多样性保留，现有方法的直觉（变异性等于垃圾）在这类任务中反向生效。

Abstract: For machine learning datasets to accurately represent diverse opinions in a
population, they must preserve variation in data labels while filtering out
spam or low-quality responses. How can we balance annotator reliability and
representation? We empirically evaluate how a range of heuristics for annotator
filtering affect the preservation of variation on subjective tasks. We find
that these methods, designed for contexts in which variation from a single
ground-truth label is considered noise, often remove annotators who disagree
instead of spam annotators, introducing suboptimal tradeoffs between accuracy
and label diversity. We find that conservative settings for annotator removal
(<5%) are best, after which all tested methods increase the mean absolute error
from the true average label. We analyze performance on synthetic spam to
observe that these methods often assume spam annotators are less random than
real spammers tend to be: most spammers are distributionally indistinguishable
from real annotators, and the minority that are distinguishable tend to give
fixed answers, not random ones. Thus, tasks requiring the preservation of
variation reverse the intuition of existing spam filtering methods: spammers
tend to be less random than non-spammers, so metrics that assume variation is
spam fare worse. These results highlight the need for spam removal methods that
account for label diversity.

Motivation: 理解不同文档间信息共享方式对信息检索、摘要等任务至关重要，需要一种能够模型语义覆盖关系的框架。

Result: 判别模型表现显著超过生成模型，RoBERTa-base模型达到61.4%的最高准确率，Random Forest模型在宏观F1分数上表现最佳（52.9%）。

Conclusion: 问题回答方法为评估语义关系提供了有效视角，能够识别文本深层信息关联，而非仅仅表面相似性。

Abstract: Understanding how information is shared across documents, regardless of the
format in which it is expressed, is critical for tasks such as information
retrieval, summarization, and content alignment. In this work, we introduce a
novel framework for modelling Semantic Coverage Relations (SCR), which
classifies document pairs based on how their informational content aligns. We
define three core relation types: equivalence, where both texts convey the same
information using different textual forms or styles; inclusion, where one
document fully contains the information of another and adds more; and semantic
overlap, where each document presents partially overlapping content. To capture
these relations, we adopt a question answering (QA)-based approach, using the
answerability of shared questions across documents as an indicator of semantic
coverage. We construct a synthetic dataset derived from the SQuAD corpus by
paraphrasing source passages and selectively omitting information, enabling
precise control over content overlap. This dataset allows us to benchmark
generative language models and train transformer-based classifiers for SCR
prediction. Our findings demonstrate that discriminative models significantly
outperform generative approaches, with the RoBERTa-base model achieving the
highest accuracy of 61.4% and the Random Forest-based model showing the best
balance with a macro-F1 score of 52.9%. The results show that QA provides an
effective lens for assessing semantic relations across stylistically diverse
texts, offering insights into the capacity of current models to reason about
information beyond surface similarity. The dataset and code developed in this
study are publicly available to support reproducibility.

Motivation: 探索在文本去毒化等敏感领域使用LLM生成的合成有毒数据替代人工标注数据的可行性，以降低数据收集成本。

Method: 使用Llama 3和Qwen激活修补模型为ParaDetox和SST-2数据集中的中性文本生成合成有毒对应文本，并比较基于合成数据和人类数据训练的模型性能。

Result: 基于合成数据训练的模型性能始终低于基于人类数据训练的模型，联合指标性能下降高达30%，主要原因是LLM生成的有毒内容词汇多样性严重不足。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在生成有毒内容方面存在局限性，词汇重复且缺乏人类毒性的细微差别，强调了多样化人工标注数据对于构建鲁棒去毒系统的重要性。

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are excellent at generating synthetic
data. However, their performance in sensitive domains such as text
detoxification has not received proper attention from the scientific community.
This paper explores the possibility of using LLM-generated synthetic toxic data
as an alternative to human-generated data for training models for
detoxification. Using Llama 3 and Qwen activation-patched models, we generated
synthetic toxic counterparts for neutral texts from ParaDetox and SST-2
datasets. Our experiments show that models fine-tuned on synthetic data
consistently perform worse than those trained on human data, with a drop in
performance of up to 30% in joint metrics. The root cause is identified as a
critical lexical diversity gap: LLMs generate toxic content using a small,
repetitive vocabulary of insults that fails to capture the nuances and variety
of human toxicity. These findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs in
this domain and emphasize the continued importance of diverse, human-annotated
data for building robust detoxification systems.

Method: 基于LLaMA架构的10亿参数模型，使用低秩适应（LoRA）技术进行微调，每个任务仅使用几百到一千个样本进行训练，专注于JSON提取、知识图谱提取和命名实体识别三个任务。

Result: ETLCH在大多数评估指标上优于强基线模型，即使在最低数据规模下也观察到显著增益，证明了小模型能够提供稳定准确的结构化输出。

Conclusion: 精心调优的小模型能够以极低的计算成本实现可靠的信息提取，为资源受限环境提供了成本效益高且可靠的结构化数据提取解决方案。

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) for structured data extraction in
domains such as financial compliance reporting, legal document analytics, and
multilingual knowledge base construction is often impractical for smaller teams
due to the high cost of running large architectures and the difficulty of
preparing large, high-quality datasets. Most recent instruction-tuning studies
focus on seven-billion-parameter or larger models, leaving limited evidence on
whether much smaller models can work reliably under low-resource, multi-task
conditions. This work presents ETLCH, a billion-parameter LLaMA-based model
fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation on only a few hundred to one thousand
samples per task for JSON extraction, knowledge graph extraction, and named
entity recognition. Despite its small scale, ETLCH outperforms strong baselines
across most evaluation metrics, with substantial gains observed even at the
lowest data scale. These findings demonstrate that well-tuned small models can
deliver stable and accurate structured outputs at a fraction of the
computational cost, enabling cost-effective and reliable information extraction
pipelines in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: In an era where misinformation spreads freely, fact-checking (FC) plays a
crucial role in verifying claims and promoting reliable information. While
automated fact-checking (AFC) has advanced significantly, existing systems
remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that manipulate or generate claims,
evidence, or claim-evidence pairs. These attacks can distort the truth, mislead
decision-makers, and ultimately undermine the reliability of FC models. Despite
growing research interest in adversarial attacks against AFC systems, a
comprehensive, holistic overview of key challenges remains lacking. These
challenges include understanding attack strategies, assessing the resilience of
current models, and identifying ways to enhance robustness. This survey
provides the first in-depth review of adversarial attacks targeting FC,
categorizing existing attack methodologies and evaluating their impact on AFC
systems. Additionally, we examine recent advancements in adversary-aware
defenses and highlight open research questions that require further
exploration. Our findings underscore the urgent need for resilient FC
frameworks capable of withstanding adversarial manipulations in pursuit of
preserving high verification accuracy.

Motivation: 人类调查中存在同意偏见（倾向于同意陈述），而LLMs基于人类数据训练且易受输入影响，因此研究LLMs是否存在类似偏见

Method: 在不同模型、任务和语言（英语、德语、波兰语）中研究LLMs的同意偏见表现

Result: 与人类相反，LLMs显示出倾向于回答"不"的偏见，无论这是表示同意还是不同意

Conclusion: LLMs表现出与人类不同的回答模式，存在系统性否定回答偏见，这对LLMs在调查和研究中的应用具有重要意义

Abstract: Acquiescence bias, i.e. the tendency of humans to agree with statements in
surveys, independent of their actual beliefs, is well researched and
documented. Since Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be very
influenceable by relatively small changes in input and are trained on
human-generated data, it is reasonable to assume that they could show a similar
tendency. We present a study investigating the presence of acquiescence bias in
LLMs across different models, tasks, and languages (English, German, and
Polish). Our results indicate that, contrary to humans, LLMs display a bias
towards answering no, regardless of whether it indicates agreement or
disagreement.

Method: 基于语言期望偏差框架，分析6个开源LLM在3种提示条件下的输出，比较11个人设驱动响应与通用AI助手的差异，使用自建Self-Stereo数据集，通过具体性、特定性和否定性3个指标测量抽象度

Result: 结果显示人设提示在调节语言抽象度方面效果有限，证实了人设作为社会人口群体代表的生态问题，展示了即使在谓似发声边缘群体时仍存在传播定型观念的风险

Conclusion: 人设提示技术在调节LLM语言表达方面有显著局限性，需要更加谨慎地考虑其对社会定型觅向的潜在影响

Abstract: Persona-prompting is a growing strategy to steer LLMs toward simulating
particular perspectives or linguistic styles through the lens of a specified
identity. While this method is often used to personalize outputs, its impact on
how LLMs represent social groups remains underexplored. In this paper, we
investigate whether persona-prompting leads to different levels of linguistic
abstraction - an established marker of stereotyping - when generating short
texts linking socio-demographic categories with stereotypical or
non-stereotypical attributes. Drawing on the Linguistic Expectancy Bias
framework, we analyze outputs from six open-weight LLMs under three prompting
conditions, comparing 11 persona-driven responses to those of a generic AI
assistant. To support this analysis, we introduce Self-Stereo, a new dataset of
self-reported stereotypes from Reddit. We measure abstraction through three
metrics: concreteness, specificity, and negation. Our results highlight the
limits of persona-prompting in modulating abstraction in language, confirming
criticisms about the ecology of personas as representative of socio-demographic
groups and raising concerns about the risk of propagating stereotypes even when
seemingly evoking the voice of a marginalized group.

Motivation: 现有方法往往单独优化对齐维度，导致权衡和不一致行为；MoE架构虽然提供模块化但路由校准不佳，限制了在对齐任务中的有效性。

Method: 提出TrinityX框架，包含分别针对HHH三个维度训练的专家，通过校准的任务自适应路由机制整合专家信号，形成统一的对齐感知表示。

Result: 在三个标准对齐基准测试中：Alpaca(Helpfulness)、BeaverTails(Harmlessness)、TruthfulQA(Honesty)，TrinityX相比基线方法在胜率上提升32.5%，安全分数提升33.9%，真实性提升28.4%，同时内存使用和推理延迟降低40%以上。

Conclusion: TrinityX通过混合校准专家和自适应路由机制，有效解决了LLM对齐中的多维度权衡问题，在性能提升的同时显著降低了计算开销，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong performance across a wide range
of NLP tasks, yet aligning their outputs with the principles of Helpfulness,
Harmlessness, and Honesty (HHH) remains a persistent challenge. Existing
methods often optimize for individual alignment dimensions in isolation,
leading to trade-offs and inconsistent behavior. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architectures offer modularity, they suffer from poorly calibrated routing,
limiting their effectiveness in alignment tasks. We propose TrinityX, a modular
alignment framework that incorporates a Mixture of Calibrated Experts (MoCaE)
within the Transformer architecture. TrinityX leverages separately trained
experts for each HHH dimension, integrating their outputs through a calibrated,
task-adaptive routing mechanism that combines expert signals into a unified,
alignment-aware representation. Extensive experiments on three standard
alignment benchmarks-Alpaca (Helpfulness), BeaverTails (Harmlessness), and
TruthfulQA (Honesty)-demonstrate that TrinityX outperforms strong baselines,
achieving relative improvements of 32.5% in win rate, 33.9% in safety score,
and 28.4% in truthfulness. In addition, TrinityX reduces memory usage and
inference latency by over 40% compared to prior MoE-based approaches. Ablation
studies highlight the importance of calibrated routing, and cross-model
evaluations confirm TrinityX's generalization across diverse LLM backbones.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型在英语和其他语言之间存在显著的对齐性能差距。现有方法存在两个主要问题：1）不是所有英语响应都高质量，低质量英语响应会导致其他语言对齐错误；2）现有方法通常使用偏见或含有偏见的方法来构建多语言偏好数据。

Result: 在三个大语言模型和三个常见任务上的实验结果证明了该方法的有效性和优势性。

Conclusion: 该研究表明构建高质量的偏好数据对于改善多语言对齐性能至关重要。

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) generally show a significant performance
gap in alignment between English and other languages. To bridge this gap,
existing research typically leverages the model's responses in English as a
reference to select the best/worst responses in other languages, which are then
used for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training. However, we argue that
there are two limitations in the current methods that result in noisy
multilingual preference data and further limited alignment performance: 1) Not
all English responses are of high quality, and using a response with low
quality may mislead the alignment for other languages. 2) Current methods
usually use biased or heuristic approaches to construct multilingual preference
pairs. To address these limitations, we design a consistency-based data
selection method to construct high-quality multilingual preference data for
improving multilingual alignment (CM-Align). Specifically, our method includes
two parts: consistency-guided English reference selection and cross-lingual
consistency-based multilingual preference data construction. Experimental
results on three LLMs and three common tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our method, which further indicates the necessity of
constructing high-quality preference data.

Method: 采用集成学习方法，聚合多个LLM变体（包括Anthropic和Google的模型）的输出，结合检索增强生成（RAG）框架，研究上下文长度对性能的影响。

Result: 集成方法在BioASQ挑战任务中超越单个LLM，在某些情况下媲美或超越领域调优系统，同时保持通用性，发现上下文长度与性能存在关联关系。

Conclusion: 基于集成的零样本方法结合有效的RAG管道，为生物医学问答提供了实用且可扩展的替代方案，精确的检索对于确保LLM在相关信息边界内生成答案至关重要。

Abstract: Biomedical question answering (QA) poses significant challenges due to the
need for precise interpretation of specialized knowledge drawn from a vast,
complex, and rapidly evolving corpus. In this work, we explore how large
language models (LLMs) can be used for information retrieval (IR), and an
ensemble of zero-shot models can accomplish state-of-the-art performance on a
domain-specific Yes/No QA task. Evaluating our approach on the BioASQ challenge
tasks, we show that ensembles can outperform individual LLMs and in some cases
rival or surpass domain-tuned systems - all while preserving generalizability
and avoiding the need for costly fine-tuning or labeled data. Our method
aggregates outputs from multiple LLM variants, including models from Anthropic
and Google, to synthesize more accurate and robust answers. Moreover, our
investigation highlights a relationship between context length and performance:
while expanded contexts are meant to provide valuable evidence, they
simultaneously risk information dilution and model disorientation. These
findings emphasize IR as a critical foundation in Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) approaches for biomedical QA systems. Precise, focused
retrieval remains essential for ensuring LLMs operate within relevant
information boundaries when generating answers from retrieved documents. Our
results establish that ensemble-based zero-shot approaches, when paired with
effective RAG pipelines, constitute a practical and scalable alternative to
domain-tuned systems for biomedical question answering.

TL;DR: 大语言模型在医学领域存在显著的记忆现象，这种记忆既有利于医学准确性，也可能导致敏感信息泄漏


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在医学领域的记忆程度，了解其预估量、特征、影响等关键问题

Method: 系统分析三种适配场景：医学语料续预训练、标准医学测试集微调、真实临床数据微调（包含13,000+临床记录）

Result: 记忆现象在所有适配场景中都很普遍，比普通领域更为显著，可分为有益记忆、无信息记忆和有害记忆三类

Conclusion: 提出实践建议：促进有益记忆提升领域理解，减少无信息记忆激洛深层学习，防止有害记忆避免敏感信息泄漏

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in
medicine. To date, LLMs have been widely applied to tasks such as diagnostic
assistance, medical question answering, and clinical information synthesis.
However, a key open question remains: to what extent do LLMs memorize medical
training data. In this study, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of
memorization of LLMs in medicine, assessing its prevalence (how frequently it
occurs), characteristics (what is memorized), volume (how much content is
memorized), and potential downstream impacts (how memorization may affect
medical applications). We systematically analyze common adaptation scenarios:
(1) continued pretraining on medical corpora, (2) fine-tuning on standard
medical benchmarks, and (3) fine-tuning on real-world clinical data, including
over 13,000 unique inpatient records from Yale New Haven Health System. The
results demonstrate that memorization is prevalent across all adaptation
scenarios and significantly higher than reported in the general domain.
Memorization affects both the development and adoption of LLMs in medicine and
can be categorized into three types: beneficial (e.g., accurate recall of
clinical guidelines and biomedical references), uninformative (e.g., repeated
disclaimers or templated medical document language), and harmful (e.g.,
regeneration of dataset-specific or sensitive clinical content). Based on these
findings, we offer practical recommendations to facilitate beneficial
memorization that enhances domain-specific reasoning and factual accuracy,
minimize uninformative memorization to promote deeper learning beyond
surface-level patterns, and mitigate harmful memorization to prevent the
leakage of sensitive or identifiable patient information.

TL;DR: 提出OTESGN模型，通过最优传输增强的语法-语义图网络，结合语法图注意力和语义最优传输注意力，在ABSA任务中实现了最先进的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于语法树和方面感知注意力的方法难以建模复杂语义关系，线性点积特征无法捕捉非线性关联，导致不相关词的噪声相似性掩盖关键意见词

Method: OTESGN模型包含语法图感知注意力挖掘潜在语法依赖和全局语法拓扑，语义最优传输注意力在文本噪声中发现细粒度语义对齐，自适应注意力融合模块整合异构特征，对比正则化提高鲁棒性

Result: 在Twitter数据集上F1提升1.01%，在Laptop14数据集上F1提升1.30%，达到最先进水平

Conclusion: OTESGN能精确定位意见词并抵抗噪声，消融研究和可视化分析验证了其有效性

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to identify aspect terms and
determine their sentiment polarity. While dependency trees combined with
contextual semantics effectively identify aspect sentiment, existing methods
relying on syntax trees and aspect-aware attention struggle to model complex
semantic relationships. Their dependence on linear dot-product features fails
to capture nonlinear associations, allowing noisy similarity from irrelevant
words to obscure key opinion terms. Motivated by Differentiable Optimal
Matching, we propose the Optimal Transport Enhanced Syntactic-Semantic Graph
Network (OTESGN), which introduces a Syntactic-Semantic Collaborative
Attention. It comprises a Syntactic Graph-Aware Attention for mining latent
syntactic dependencies and modeling global syntactic topology, as well as a
Semantic Optimal Transport Attention designed to uncover fine-grained semantic
alignments amidst textual noise, thereby accurately capturing sentiment signals
obscured by irrelevant tokens. A Adaptive Attention Fusion module integrates
these heterogeneous features, and contrastive regularization further improves
robustness. Experiments demonstrate that OTESGN achieves state-of-the-art
results, outperforming previous best models by +1.01% F1 on Twitter and +1.30%
F1 on Laptop14 benchmarks. Ablative studies and visual analyses corroborate its
efficacy in precise localization of opinion words and noise resistance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的M2S压缩方法依赖少量手动编写的模板，需要自动化框架来发现和优化更有效的模板结构。

Method: 使用语言模型引导的进化方法，结合12个来源的智能采样和LLM-as-judge评估机制，设置成功阈值θ=0.70进行五代进化。

Result: 在GPT-4.1上获得44.8%的整体成功率（103/230），发现提示长度与得分呈正相关，结构增益可跨模型迁移但效果因目标而异。

Conclusion: 结构级搜索是增强单轮探测的可重复途径，强调了阈值校准和跨模型评估的重要性，代码和配置已开源。

Abstract: Multi-turn-to-single-turn (M2S) compresses iterative red-teaming into one
structured prompt, but prior work relied on a handful of manually written
templates. We present X-Teaming Evolutionary M2S, an automated framework that
discovers and optimizes M2S templates through language-model-guided evolution.
The system pairs smart sampling from 12 sources with an LLM-as-judge inspired
by StrongREJECT and records fully auditable logs.
  Maintaining selection pressure by setting the success threshold to $\theta =
0.70$, we obtain five evolutionary generations, two new template families, and
44.8% overall success (103/230) on GPT-4.1. A balanced cross-model panel of
2,500 trials (judge fixed) shows that structural gains transfer but vary by
target; two models score zero at the same threshold. We also find a positive
coupling between prompt length and score, motivating length-aware judging.
  Our results demonstrate that structure-level search is a reproducible route
to stronger single-turn probes and underscore the importance of threshold
calibration and cross-model evaluation. Code, configurations, and artifacts are

TL;DR: DSM是一种流式多模态序列到序列学习框架，通过在预处理阶段引入延迟对齐，使用仅解码器语言模型实现任意输出序列的流式推理，在ASR和TTS任务上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统序列到序列生成要么是离线处理（完整输入后才开始输出），要么需要学习复杂的流控制策略。DSM旨在提供更灵活、高效的流式多模态序列处理方案。

Method: 将时间对齐移到预处理步骤，在流之间引入适当延迟，使用仅解码器语言模型处理已对齐的多模态流，支持任意输入组合的流式推理。

Result: 在自动语音识别(ASR)和文本到语音(TTS)任务上，DSM实现了最先进的性能和延迟，支持任意长序列，甚至与离线基线相竞争。

Conclusion: DSM为多模态序列到序列学习提供了灵活高效的流式处理框架，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了延迟。

Abstract: We introduce Delayed Streams Modeling (DSM), a flexible formulation for
streaming, multimodal sequence-to-sequence learning. Sequence-to-sequence
generation is often cast in an offline manner, where the model consumes the
complete input sequence before generating the first output timestep.
Alternatively, streaming sequence-to-sequence rely on learning a policy for
choosing when to advance on the input stream, or write to the output stream.
DSM instead models already time-aligned streams with a decoder-only language
model. By moving the alignment to a pre-processing step,and introducing
appropriate delays between streams, DSM provides streaming inference of
arbitrary output sequences, from any input combination, making it applicable to
many sequence-to-sequence problems. In particular, given text and audio
streams, automatic speech recognition (ASR) corresponds to the text stream
being delayed, while the opposite gives a text-to-speech (TTS) model. We
perform extensive experiments for these two major sequence-to-sequence tasks,
showing that DSM provides state-of-the-art performance and latency while
supporting arbitrary long sequences, being even competitive with offline
baselines. Code, samples and demos are available at

<details>

Motivation: 理解Transformer语言模型如何存储和检索事实关联，并探索这些发现是否能够泛化到不同自回归架构

Method: 对GPT、LLaMA、Qwen和DeepSeek等多个模型进行全面评估，分析事实信息的编码位置和访问方式

Result: 发现Qwen模型与之前模式不同：最早层的注意力模块对事实记录的贡献远超MLP模块

Conclusion: 即使在自回归Transformer家族内，架构变化也会导致事实记录机制的根本性差异

Abstract: Understanding how Transformer-based language models store and retrieve
factual associations is critical for improving interpretability and enabling
targeted model editing. Prior work, primarily on GPT-style models, has
identified MLP modules in early layers as key contributors to factual recall.
However, it remains unclear whether these findings generalize across different
autoregressive architectures. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of factual recall across several models -- including GPT, LLaMA,
Qwen, and DeepSeek -- analyzing where and how factual information is encoded
and accessed. Consequently, we find that Qwen-based models behave differently
from previous patterns: attention modules in the earliest layers contribute
more to factual recall than MLP modules. Our findings suggest that even within
the autoregressive Transformer family, architectural variations can lead to
fundamentally different mechanisms of factual recall.

TL;DR: 一种新的无监督注释评估方法，通过学生模型与噪声教师(LLM)协作，使用CAI比率量化注释质量，无需人工反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态无监督环境中，传统方法难以评估LLM注释质量，需要一种无需人工反馈的评估方法。

Method: 提出代理注释范式，学生模型作为无监督反馈机制，使用用户偏好多数投票策略，并提出CAI比率评估指标。

Result: 在10个开放域NLP数据集和4个LLM上验证，CAI比率与LLM准确性呈强正相关。

Conclusion: CAI比率是一种有效的无监督评估工具，可用于动态环境中的模型选择和质量评估。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), when paired with prompt-based tasks, have
significantly reduced data annotation costs and reliance on human annotators.
However, evaluating the quality of their annotations remains challenging in
dynamic, unsupervised environments where oracle feedback is scarce and
conventional methods fail. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
agentic annotation paradigm, where a student model collaborates with a noisy
teacher (the LLM) to assess and refine annotation quality without relying on
oracle feedback. The student model, acting as an unsupervised feedback
mechanism, employs a user preference-based majority voting strategy to evaluate
the consistency of the LLM outputs. To systematically measure the reliability
of LLM-generated annotations, we introduce the Consistent and Inconsistent
(CAI) Ratio, a novel unsupervised evaluation metric. The CAI Ratio not only
quantifies the annotation quality of the noisy teacher under limited user
preferences but also plays a critical role in model selection, enabling the
identification of robust LLMs in dynamic, unsupervised environments. Applied to
ten open-domain NLP datasets across four LLMs, the CAI Ratio demonstrates a
strong positive correlation with LLM accuracy, establishing it as an essential
tool for unsupervised evaluation and model selection in real-world settings.

Method: 结合基于语素和BPE的混合分词方法MoVoC，构建形态感知词汇表MoVoC-Tok

Result: 在自动翻译质量上没有显著提升，但在MorphoScore和边界精度等内在指标上有持续改进

Conclusion: 形态感知分词在增强语言保真度和分词效率方面具有价值，发布了标注数据集和分词器支持后续研究

Abstract: Subword-based tokenization methods often fail to preserve morphological
boundaries, a limitation especially pronounced in low-resource, morphologically
complex languages such as those written in the Geez script. To address this, we
present MoVoC (Morpheme-aware Subword Vocabulary Construction) and train
MoVoC-Tok, a tokenizer that integrates supervised morphological analysis into
the subword vocabulary. This hybrid segmentation approach combines
morpheme-based and Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokens to preserve morphological
integrity while maintaining lexical meaning. To tackle resource scarcity, we
curate and release manually annotated morpheme data for four Geez script
languages and a morpheme-aware vocabulary for two of them. While the proposed
tokenization method does not lead to significant gains in automatic translation
quality, we observe consistent improvements in intrinsic metrics, MorphoScore,
and Boundary Precision, highlighting the value of morphology-aware segmentation
in enhancing linguistic fidelity and token efficiency. Our morpheme-annotated
datasets and tokenizer will be publicly available to support further research
in low-resource, morphologically rich languages. Our code and data are

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) is deeply influenced by the
quality and composition of their training data. While much of the existing work
has centered on English, there remains a gap in understanding how to construct
effective training corpora for other languages. We explore scalable methods for
building web-based corpora for LLMs. We apply them to build a new 120B token
corpus in Portuguese that achieves competitive results to an industrial-grade
corpus. Using a continual pretraining setup, we study how different data
selection and preprocessing strategies affect LLM performance when
transitioning a model originally trained in English to another language. Our
findings demonstrate the value of language-specific filtering pipelines,
including classifiers for education, science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics (STEM), as well as toxic content. We show that adapting a model to
the target language leads to performance improvements, reinforcing the
importance of high-quality, language-specific data. While our case study
focuses on Portuguese, our methods are applicable to other languages, offering
insights for multilingual LLM development.

Conclusion: LLM hacking风险幽灵不散，故意攻击极其简单，需要更严格的验证机制和人工注释来确保研究可靠性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming social science research
by enabling the automation of labor-intensive tasks like data annotation and
text analysis. However, LLM outputs vary significantly depending on the
implementation choices made by researchers (e.g., model selection, prompting
strategy, or temperature settings). Such variation can introduce systematic
biases and random errors, which propagate to downstream analyses and cause Type
I, Type II, Type S, or Type M errors. We call this LLM hacking.
  We quantify the risk of LLM hacking by replicating 37 data annotation tasks
from 21 published social science research studies with 18 different models.
Analyzing 13 million LLM labels, we test 2,361 realistic hypotheses to measure
how plausible researcher choices affect statistical conclusions. We find
incorrect conclusions based on LLM-annotated data in approximately one in three
hypotheses for state-of-the-art models, and in half the hypotheses for small
language models. While our findings show that higher task performance and
better general model capabilities reduce LLM hacking risk, even highly accurate
models do not completely eliminate it. The risk of LLM hacking decreases as
effect sizes increase, indicating the need for more rigorous verification of
findings near significance thresholds. Our extensive analysis of LLM hacking
mitigation techniques emphasizes the importance of human annotations in
reducing false positive findings and improving model selection. Surprisingly,
common regression estimator correction techniques are largely ineffective in
reducing LLM hacking risk, as they heavily trade off Type I vs. Type II errors.
  Beyond accidental errors, we find that intentional LLM hacking is
unacceptably simple. With few LLMs and just a handful of prompt paraphrases,
anything can be presented as statistically significant.

Abstract: In this paper, we survey recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for
reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs). RL has achieved remarkable success
in advancing the frontier of LLM capabilities, particularly in addressing
complex logical tasks such as mathematics and coding. As a result, RL has
emerged as a foundational methodology for transforming LLMs into LRMs. With the
rapid progress of the field, further scaling of RL for LRMs now faces
foundational challenges not only in computational resources but also in
algorithm design, training data, and infrastructure. To this end, it is timely
to revisit the development of this domain, reassess its trajectory, and explore
strategies to enhance the scalability of RL toward Artificial SuperIntelligence
(ASI). In particular, we examine research applying RL to LLMs and LRMs for
reasoning abilities, especially since the release of DeepSeek-R1, including
foundational components, core problems, training resources, and downstream
applications, to identify future opportunities and directions for this rapidly
evolving area. We hope this review will promote future research on RL for

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地球观测卫星存在轨道偏移困难、传感器视野有限、指向操作资源消耗大等限制，需要优化数据采集效率和采集最重要的信息。动态目标指向技术可以利用卫星资源和预先仪器数据来智能地重新配置和指向主仪器。

Method: 提出了两种学习基于的方法：1）强化学习方法；2）模仿学习方法。这些学习方法基于动态规划解决方案来规划采样位置序列。

Result: 模仿学习方法比最佳惯例方法平均提高10.0%，强化学习方法平均提高13.7%。两种学习方法都能在相对较小的数据量下有效训练。

Conclusion: 学习基于的动态目标指向方法在地球观测卫星数据采集中表现出明显优势，能够显著提高科学信息采集效率，且训练效率高，具有良好的应用前景。

Abstract: Earth observing satellites are powerful tools for collecting scientific
information about our planet, however they have limitations: they cannot easily
deviate from their orbital trajectories, their sensors have a limited field of
view, and pointing and operating these sensors can take a large amount of the
spacecraft's resources. It is important for these satellites to optimize the
data they collect and include only the most important or informative
measurements. Dynamic targeting is an emerging concept in which satellite
resources and data from a lookahead instrument are used to intelligently
reconfigure and point a primary instrument. Simulation studies have shown that
dynamic targeting increases the amount of scientific information gathered
versus conventional sampling strategies. In this work, we present two different
learning-based approaches to dynamic targeting, using reinforcement and
imitation learning, respectively. These learning methods build on a dynamic
programming solution to plan a sequence of sampling locations. We evaluate our
approaches against existing heuristic methods for dynamic targeting, showing
the benefits of using learning for this application. Imitation learning
performs on average 10.0\% better than the best heuristic method, while
reinforcement learning performs on average 13.7\% better. We also show that
both learning methods can be trained effectively with relatively small amounts
of data.

Motivation: 开源软件组件重用过程手动、易出错且分散，开发者需要查阅文档、理解API并编写集成代码，存在效率障碍。

Method: EnvX采用三阶段流程：1)TODO引导的环境初始化；2)人类对齐的代理自动化；3)代理间(A2A)协作协议，结合大语言模型能力和结构化工具集成。

Result: 在GitTaskBench基准测试的18个跨领域仓库中，EnvX达到74.07%的执行完成率和51.85%的任务通过率，优于现有框架。

Conclusion: EnvX将仓库从被动代码资源转变为智能交互代理，促进了开源生态系统的可访问性和协作性。

Abstract: The widespread availability of open-source repositories has led to a vast
collection of reusable software components, yet their utilization remains
manual, error-prone, and disconnected. Developers must navigate documentation,
understand APIs, and write integration code, creating significant barriers to
efficient software reuse. To address this, we present EnvX, a framework that
leverages Agentic AI to agentize GitHub repositories, transforming them into
intelligent, autonomous agents capable of natural language interaction and
inter-agent collaboration. Unlike existing approaches that treat repositories
as static code resources, EnvX reimagines them as active agents through a
three-phase process: (1) TODO-guided environment initialization, which sets up
the necessary dependencies, data, and validation datasets; (2) human-aligned
agentic automation, allowing repository-specific agents to autonomously perform
real-world tasks; and (3) Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol, enabling multiple
agents to collaborate. By combining large language model capabilities with
structured tool integration, EnvX automates not just code generation, but the
entire process of understanding, initializing, and operationalizing repository
functionality. We evaluate EnvX on the GitTaskBench benchmark, using 18
repositories across domains such as image processing, speech recognition,
document analysis, and video manipulation. Our results show that EnvX achieves
a 74.07% execution completion rate and 51.85% task pass rate, outperforming
existing frameworks. Case studies further demonstrate EnvX's ability to enable
multi-repository collaboration via the A2A protocol. This work marks a shift
from treating repositories as passive code resources to intelligent,
interactive agents, fostering greater accessibility and collaboration within
the open-source ecosystem.

Conclusion: 2TSD模型通过任务特定的信任语义提取和传输，有效解决了分布式信任评估中的开销和准确性问题

Abstract: Accurate trustworthiness evaluation of potential collaborating devices is
essential for the effective execution of complex computing tasks. This
evaluation process involves collecting diverse trust-related data from
potential collaborators, including historical performance and available
resources, for collaborator selection. However, when each task owner
independently assesses all collaborators' trustworthiness, frequent data
exchange, complex reasoning, and dynamic situation changes can result in
significant overhead and deteriorated trust evaluation. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a task-specific trust semantics distillation (2TSD)
model based on a large AI model (LAM)-driven teacher-student agent
architecture. The teacher agent is deployed on a server with powerful
computational capabilities and an augmented memory module dedicated to
multidimensional trust-related data collection, task-specific trust semantics
extraction, and task-collaborator matching analysis. Upon receiving
task-specific requests from device-side student agents, the teacher agent
transfers the trust semantics of potential collaborators to the student agents,
enabling rapid and accurate collaborator selection. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed 2TSD model can reduce collaborator evaluation
time, decrease device resource consumption, and improve the accuracy of
collaborator selection.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ExRAP框架通过探索增强检索和规划，提升LLM在动态环境中的持续指令跟随能力，结合信息探索和时序一致性优化，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决具身智能体在动态非平稳环境中执行持续指令跟随任务时，LLM需要有效探索环境并建立环境上下文记忆的挑战。

Method: 提出探索检索增强规划框架，将指令分解为环境上下文查询和任务执行，集成信息探索到LLM规划过程，并使用时序一致性精化处理记忆知识衰减。

Result: 在VirtualHome、ALFRED和CARLA等基准测试中，该方法对各种指令规模、类型和非平稳度场景都表现出鲁棒性，在目标成功率和执行效率上均优于最先进的LLM规划方法。

Conclusion: ExRAP框架通过有效平衡环境探索负载和上下文记忆有效性，显著提升了具身智能体在动态环境中的持续任务执行能力。

Abstract: This study presents an Exploratory Retrieval-Augmented Planning (ExRAP)
framework, designed to tackle continual instruction following tasks of embodied
agents in dynamic, non-stationary environments. The framework enhances Large
Language Models' (LLMs) embodied reasoning capabilities by efficiently
exploring the physical environment and establishing the environmental context
memory, thereby effectively grounding the task planning process in time-varying
environment contexts. In ExRAP, given multiple continual instruction following
tasks, each instruction is decomposed into queries on the environmental context
memory and task executions conditioned on the query results. To efficiently
handle these multiple tasks that are performed continuously and simultaneously,
we implement an exploration-integrated task planning scheme by incorporating
the {information-based exploration} into the LLM-based planning process.
Combined with memory-augmented query evaluation, this integrated scheme not
only allows for a better balance between the validity of the environmental
context memory and the load of environment exploration, but also improves
overall task performance. Furthermore, we devise a {temporal consistency
refinement} scheme for query evaluation to address the inherent decay of
knowledge in the memory. Through experiments with VirtualHome, ALFRED, and
CARLA, our approach demonstrates robustness against a variety of embodied
instruction following scenarios involving different instruction scales and
types, and non-stationarity degrees, and it consistently outperforms other
state-of-the-art LLM-based task planning approaches in terms of both goal
success rate and execution efficiency.

Abstract: As a result of continuous advances in Music Information Retrieval (MIR)
technology, generating and distributing music has become more diverse and
accessible. In this context, interest in music intellectual property protection
is increasing to safeguard individual music copyrights. In this work, we
propose a system for detecting music plagiarism by combining various MIR

musically meaningful segments from audio recordings to detect plagiarism across
different musical formats. With this system, we compute similarity scores based
on multiple musical features that can be evaluated through comprehensive
musical analysis. Our approach demonstrated promising results in music
plagiarism detection experiments, and the proposed method can be applied to
real-world music scenarios. We also collected a Similar Music Pair (SMP)
dataset for musical similarity research using real-world cases. The dataset are

Abstract: The evolution toward Level 4 (L4) Autonomous Networks (AN) represents a
strategic inflection point in telecommunications, where networks must transcend
reactive automation to achieve genuine cognitive capabilities--fulfilling TM
Forum's vision of self-configuring, self-healing, and self-optimizing systems
that deliver zero-wait, zero-touch, and zero-fault services. This work bridges
the gap between architectural theory and operational reality by implementing
Joseph Sifakis's AN Agent reference architecture in a functional cognitive
system, deploying coordinated proactive-reactive runtimes driven by hybrid
knowledge representation. Through an empirical case study of a Radio Access
Network (RAN) Link Adaptation (LA) Agent, we validate this framework's
transformative potential: demonstrating sub-10 ms real-time control in 5G NR
sub-6 GHz while achieving 6% higher downlink throughput than Outer Loop Link
Adaptation (OLLA) algorithms and 67% Block Error Rate (BLER) reduction for
ultra-reliable services through dynamic Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS)

overcoming traditional autonomy barriers and advancing critical L4-enabling

Abstract: Generating regulatorily compliant Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) remains a
high-cost, low-scalability bottleneck in Anti-Money Laundering (AML) workflows.
While large language models (LLMs) offer promising fluency, they suffer from
factual hallucination, limited crime typology alignment, and poor
explainability -- posing unacceptable risks in compliance-critical domains.
This paper introduces Co-Investigator AI, an agentic framework optimized to
produce Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) significantly faster and with
greater accuracy than traditional methods. Drawing inspiration from recent
advances in autonomous agent architectures, such as the AI Co-Scientist, our
approach integrates specialized agents for planning, crime type detection,
external intelligence gathering, and compliance validation. The system features
dynamic memory management, an AI-Privacy Guard layer for sensitive data
handling, and a real-time validation agent employing the Agent-as-a-Judge
paradigm to ensure continuous narrative quality assurance. Human investigators
remain firmly in the loop, empowered to review and refine drafts in a
collaborative workflow that blends AI efficiency with domain expertise. We
demonstrate the versatility of Co-Investigator AI across a range of complex
financial crime scenarios, highlighting its ability to streamline SAR drafting,
align narratives with regulatory expectations, and enable compliance teams to
focus on higher-order analytical work. This approach marks the beginning of a
new era in compliance reporting -- bringing the transformative benefits of AI
agents to the core of regulatory processes and paving the way for scalable,
reliable, and transparent SAR generation.

Conclusion: 将基于偏好的学习技术与思维链过程结合，能够有效提升视觉语言模型在具身智能体中的决策能力，为解决动态环境中的挑战提供了新思路。

Abstract: Using effective generalization capabilities of vision language models (VLMs)
in context-specific dynamic tasks for embodied artificial intelligence remains
a significant challenge. Although supervised fine-tuned models can better align
with the real physical world, they still exhibit sluggish responses and
hallucination issues in dynamically changing environments, necessitating
further alignment. Existing post-SFT methods, reliant on reinforcement learning
and chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, are constrained by sparse rewards and
action-only optimization, resulting in low sample efficiency, poor consistency,
and model degradation. To address these issues, this paper proposes
Thought-Centric Preference Optimization (TCPO) for effective embodied
decision-making. Specifically, TCPO introduces a stepwise preference-based
optimization approach, transforming sparse reward signals into richer step
sample pairs. It emphasizes the alignment of the model's intermediate reasoning
process, mitigating the problem of model degradation. Moreover, by
incorporating Action Policy Consistency Constraint (APC), it further imposes
consistency constraints on the model output. Experiments in the ALFWorld
environment demonstrate an average success rate of 26.67%, achieving a 6%
improvement over RL4VLM and validating the effectiveness of our approach in
mitigating model degradation after fine-tuning. These results highlight the
potential of integrating preference-based learning techniques with CoT
processes to enhance the decision-making capabilities of vision-language models
in embodied agents.

Motivation: 解决LLM作为评判官时的监督问题，避免无限监控链条，在不知道真实地面情况下保证评估的可靠性

Method: 利用不同LLM评判官之间的不一致性，通过线性规划问题形式化逻辑约束，在整数响应计数空间中计算唯一可能的评估结果

Result: 开发出无偏差告警机制，可以在不产生偏差的情况下检测到至少一个评判官违反用户指定的评分能力要求

Conclusion: 通过逻辑一致性分析可以有效监控LLM评判官的对齐性，为构建可靠的自动化评估体系提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: If we use LLMs as judges to evaluate the complex decisions of other LLMs, who
or what monitors the judges? Infinite monitoring chains are inevitable whenever
we do not know the ground truth of the decisions by experts and we do not want
to trust them. One way to ameliorate our evaluation uncertainty is to exploit
the use of logical consistency between disagreeing experts. By observing how
LLM judges agree and disagree while grading other LLMs, we can compute the only
possible evaluations of their grading ability. For example, if two LLM judges
disagree on which tasks a third one completed correctly, they cannot both be
100\% correct in their judgments. This logic can be formalized as a Linear
Programming problem in the space of integer response counts for any finite
test. We use it here to develop no-knowledge alarms for misaligned LLM judges.
The alarms can detect, with no false positives, that at least one member or
more of an ensemble of judges are violating a user specified grading ability
requirement.

Conclusion: 该工作为调试复杂智能体交互提供了原则性和有效的解决方案，为构建更可靠和可解释的多智能体系统铺平了道路

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are critical for automating complex tasks, yet
their practical deployment is severely hampered by the challenge of failure
attribution. Current diagnostic tools, which rely on statistical correlations,
are fundamentally inadequate; on challenging benchmarks like Who\&When,
state-of-the-art methods achieve less than 15\% accuracy in locating the
root-cause step of a failure. To address this critical gap, we introduce the
first failure attribution framework for MAS grounded in multi-granularity
causal inference. Our approach makes two key technical contributions: (1) a
performance causal inversion principle, which correctly models performance
dependencies by reversing the data flow in execution logs, combined with
Shapley values to accurately assign agent-level blame; (2) a novel causal
discovery algorithm, CDC-MAS, that robustly identifies critical failure steps
by tackling the non-stationary nature of MAS interaction data. The framework's
attribution results directly fuel an automated optimization loop, generating
targeted suggestions whose efficacy is validated via counterfactual
simulations. Evaluations on the Who\&When and TRAIL benchmarks demonstrate a
significant leap in performance. Our method achieves up to 36.2\% step-level
accuracy. Crucially, the generated optimizations boost overall task success
rates by an average of 22.4\%. This work provides a principled and effective
solution for debugging complex agent interactions, paving the way for more
reliable and interpretable multi-agent systems.

Abstract: We introduce a novel Theory of Mind (ToM) framework inspired by dual-process
theories from cognitive science, integrating a fast, habitual graph-based
reasoning system (System 1), implemented via graph convolutional networks

2), driven by meta-learning techniques. Our model dynamically balances
intuitive and deliberative reasoning through a learned context gate mechanism.
We validate our architecture on canonical false-belief tasks and systematically
explore its capacity to replicate hallmark cognitive biases associated with
dual-process theory, including anchoring, cognitive-load fatigue, framing
effects, and priming effects. Experimental results demonstrate that our
dual-process approach closely mirrors human adaptive behavior, achieves robust
generalization to unseen contexts, and elucidates cognitive mechanisms
underlying reasoning biases. This work bridges artificial intelligence and
cognitive theory, paving the way for AI systems exhibiting nuanced, human-like
social cognition and adaptive decision-making capabilities.

Abstract: AI scientist systems, capable of autonomously executing the full research
workflow from hypothesis generation and experimentation to paper writing, hold
significant potential for accelerating scientific discovery. However, the
internal workflow of these systems have not been closely examined. This lack of
scrutiny poses a risk of introducing flaws that could undermine the integrity,
reliability, and trustworthiness of their research outputs. In this paper, we
identify four potential failure modes in contemporary AI scientist systems:
inappropriate benchmark selection, data leakage, metric misuse, and post-hoc
selection bias. To examine these risks, we design controlled experiments that
isolate each failure mode while addressing challenges unique to evaluating AI
scientist systems. Our assessment of two prominent open-source AI scientist
systems reveals the presence of several failures, across a spectrum of
severity, which can be easily overlooked in practice. Finally, we demonstrate
that access to trace logs and code from the full automated workflow enables far
more effective detection of such failures than examining the final paper alone.
We thus recommend journals and conferences evaluating AI-generated research to
mandate submission of these artifacts alongside the paper to ensure
transparency, accountability, and reproducibility.

Abstract: We present a preliminary experimental platform that explores how narrative
elements might shape AI decision-making by combining reinforcement learning
(RL) with language model reasoning. While AI systems can now both make
decisions and engage in narrative reasoning, these capabilities have mostly
been studied separately. Our platform attempts to bridge this gap using a
dual-system architecture to examine how narrative frameworks could influence
reward-based learning. The system comprises a reinforcement learning policy
that suggests actions based on past experience, and a language model that
processes these suggestions through different narrative frameworks to guide
decisions. This setup enables initial experimentation with narrative elements
while maintaining consistent environment and reward structures. We implement
this architecture in a configurable gridworld environment, where agents receive
both policy suggestions and information about their surroundings. The
platform's modular design facilitates controlled testing of environmental
complexity, narrative parameters, and the interaction between reinforcement
learning and narrative-based decisions. Our logging system captures basic
decision metrics, from RL policy values to language model reasoning to action
selection patterns. While preliminary, this implementation provides a
foundation for studying how different narrative frameworks might affect
reward-based decisions and exploring potential interactions between
optimization-based learning and symbolic reasoning in AI systems.

Abstract: Computer science texts are particularly rich in both narrative content and
illustrative charts, algorithms, images, annotated diagrams, etc. This study
explores the extent to which vector-based multimodal retrieval, powered by
vision-language models (VLMs), can improve discovery across multi-modal (text
and images) content. Using over 3,600 digitized textbook pages largely from
computer science textbooks and a Vision Language Model (VLM), we generate
multi-vector representations capturing both textual and visual semantics. These
embeddings are stored in a vector database. We issue a benchmark of 75 natural
language queries and compare retrieval performance to ground truth and across
four similarity (distance) measures. The study is intended to expose both the
strengths and weakenesses of such an approach. We find that cosine similarity
most effectively retrieves semantically and visually relevant pages. We further
discuss the practicality of using a vector database and multi-modal embedding
for operational information retrieval. Our paper is intended to offer design
insights for discovery over digital libraries.

Abstract: The majority of research in recommender systems, be it algorithmic
improvements, context-awareness, explainability, or other areas, evaluates
these systems on datasets that capture user interaction over a relatively
limited time span. However, recommender systems can very well be used
continuously for extended time. Similarly so, user behavior may evolve over
that extended time. Although media studies and psychology offer a wealth of
research on the evolution of user preferences and behavior as individuals age,
there has been scant research in this regard within the realm of user modeling
and recommender systems. In this study, we investigate the evolution of user
preferences and behavior using the LFM-2b dataset, which, to our knowledge, is
the only dataset that encompasses a sufficiently extensive time frame to permit
real longitudinal studies and includes age information about its users. We
identify specific usage and taste preferences directly related to the age of
the user, i.e., while younger users tend to listen broadly to contemporary
popular music, older users have more elaborate and personalized listening
habits. The findings yield important insights that open new directions for
research in recommender systems, providing guidance for future efforts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), with their strong understanding and reasoning
capabilities, are increasingly being explored for tackling optimization
problems, especially in synergy with evolutionary computation. Despite rapid
progress, however, the field still lacks a unified synthesis and a systematic
taxonomy. This survey addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review of
recent developments and organizing them within a structured framework. We
classify existing research into two main stages: LLMs for optimization modeling
and LLMs for optimization solving. The latter is further divided into three
paradigms according to the role of LLMs in the optimization workflow: LLMs as
stand-alone optimizers, low-level LLMs embedded within optimization algorithms,
and high-level LLMs for algorithm selection and generation. For each category,
we analyze representative methods, distill technical challenges, and examine
their interplay with traditional approaches. We also review interdisciplinary
applications spanning the natural sciences, engineering, and machine learning.
By contrasting LLM-driven and conventional methods, we highlight key
limitations and research gaps, and point toward future directions for
developing self-evolving agentic ecosystems for optimization. An up-to-date

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然最近研究考察了LLM在重构中的效果，但对开发者如何与ChatGPT交互表达重构需求的理解仍有限

Method: 采用文本挖掘技术，从29,778个ChatGPT提示和回应中提取715个重构相关交互，分析开发者的显式重构意图

Result: 获得了开发者与ChatGPT在重构交互中的具体表达方式和需求模式的详细数据

Conclusion: 该研究为理解开发者如何使用LLM进行重构任务提供了实证基础，有助于改善AI辅助开发工具的设计

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have become widely popular and
widely used in various software engineering tasks such as refactoring, testing,
code review, and program comprehension. Although recent studies have examined
the effectiveness of LLMs in recommending and suggesting refactoring, there is
a limited understanding of how developers express their refactoring needs when
interacting with ChatGPT. In this paper, our goal is to explore interactions
related to refactoring between developers and ChatGPT to better understand how
developers identify areas for improvement in code, and how ChatGPT addresses
developers' needs. Our approach involves text mining 715 refactoring-related
interactions from 29,778 ChatGPT prompts and responses, as well as the analysis
of developers' explicit refactoring intentions.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该论文提出建立安全工厂（safety factories）的概念，将安全工程工具和方法集成到软件开发流水线中，以应对现代软件快速发展带来的安全挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代软件快速迭代和持续交付新功能，但软件开发与安全工程在方法和工具上存在脱节，需要绑定这两者以确保安全性。

Method: 建议在前期投资于形式化方法：用语义丰富的可机器处理模型捕捉安全工作产品，定义自动一致性检查，自动生成文档，并将软件开发的最佳实践转移到安全工程中。

Result: 提出了安全工厂的概念，通过将安全工具和方法集成到软件开发流水线中，实现软件开发与安全工程的一体化。

Conclusion: 建立安全工厂是应对现代软件快速发展带来的安全挑战的有效方法，通过前期投资形式化方法和自动化工具，可以在后期获得更大的收益。

Abstract: Modern cyber-physical systems are operated by complex software that
increasingly takes over safety-critical functions. Software enables rapid
iterations and continuous delivery of new functionality that meets the
ever-changing expectations of users. As high-speed development requires
discipline, rigor, and automation, software factories are used. These entail
methods and tools used for software development, such as build systems and
pipelines. To keep up with the rapid evolution of software, we need to bridge
the disconnect in methods and tools between software development and safety
engineering today. We need to invest more in formality upfront - capturing
safety work products in semantically rich models that are machine-processable,
defining automatic consistency checks, and automating the generation of
documentation - to benefit later. Transferring best practices from software to
safety engineering is worth exploring. We advocate for safety factories, which
integrate safety tooling and methods into software development pipelines.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究软件工程团队的多样性（性别和国籍）对效果的影响，发现性别多样性与项目成功正相关，国籍多样性影响微弱，两者兼有时可能产生负面影响


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件工程领域以男性为主，研究团队多样性对机会平等、生产力和创新的影响，尤其是在教育环境中评估性别和国籍多样性的作用

Method: 分析51个团队在3个学术年度的效能，使用三种不同的多样性指数（性别、国籍和其共同存在）来分析多样性对团队项目质量的影响

Result: 统计分析显示性别多样性与项目成功存在中等程度的显著正相关；国籍多样性对项目结果有轻微负面影响；两者兼有时产生负面影响，可能因为沟通障碍和文化差异增加

Conclusion: 教育环境中需要考虑多重多样性维度及其交互作用，促进团队多样性不会负面影响团队表现和教育目标的实现

Abstract: Software Engineering is mostly a male-dominated sector, where gender
diversity is a key feature for improving equality of opportunities,
productivity, and innovation. Other diversity aspects, including but not
limited to nationality and ethnicity, are often understudied.In this work we
aim to assess the impact of team diversity, focusing mainly on gender and
nationality, in the context of an agile software development project-based
course. We analyzed 51 teams over three academic years, measuring three
different Diversity indexes - regarding Gender, Nationality and their
co-presence - to examine how different aspects of diversity impact the quality
of team project outcomes.Statistical analysis revealed a moderate,
statistically significant correlation between gender diversity and project
success, aligning with existing literature. Diversity in nationality showed a
negative but negligible effect on project results, indicating that promoting
these aspects does not harm students' performance. Analyzing their co-presence
within a team, gender and nationality combined had a negative impact, likely
due to increased communication barriers and differing cultural norms.This study
underscores the importance of considering multiple diversity dimensions and
their interactions in educational settings. Our findings, overall, show that
promoting diversity in teams does not negatively impact their performance and
achievement of educational goals.

TL;DR: AutoStub使用遗传编程自动为符号执行中的外部函数生成符号存根，通过随机输入生成训练数据，自动近似函数行为，无需手动干预即可继续程序分析


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 符号执行在遇到外部函数（如原生方法或第三方库）时存在局限性，现有解决方案需要额外上下文、昂贵的SMT求解器或手动干预来近似这些函数

Method: 当符号执行器遇到外部函数时，AutoStub通过随机生成输入执行函数并收集输出来生成训练数据，然后使用遗传编程推导近似函数行为的表达式作为符号存根

Result: AutoStub能够以超过90%的准确率自动近似55%的评估函数，并能推断出语言特定行为，揭示对软件测试至关重要的边缘情况

Conclusion: 该方法使符号执行器能够在无需手动干预的情况下继续分析，实现了对先前难以处理的程序路径的探索

Abstract: Symbolic execution is a powerful technique for software testing, but suffers
from limitations when encountering external functions, such as native methods
or third-party libraries. Existing solutions often require additional context,
expensive SMT solvers, or manual intervention to approximate these functions
through symbolic stubs. In this work, we propose a novel approach to
automatically generate symbolic stubs for external functions during symbolic
execution that leverages Genetic Programming. When the symbolic executor
encounters an external function, AutoStub generates training data by executing
the function on randomly generated inputs and collecting the outputs. Genetic
Programming then derives expressions that approximate the behavior of the
function, serving as symbolic stubs. These automatically generated stubs allow
the symbolic executor to continue the analysis without manual intervention,
enabling the exploration of program paths that were previously intractable. We
demonstrate that AutoStub can automatically approximate external functions with
over 90% accuracy for 55% of the functions evaluated, and can infer
language-specific behaviors that reveal edge cases crucial for software
testing.

Method: 通过回顾科研评价历史发展，提出SAER框架，整合形式、内容和效用三维度评价，包含六个关键要素

Result: SAER框架提供了超越二元对立的理论突破，为全球评价改革提供了全面基础

Conclusion: 该系统展现了中国科研评价理论中的辨证智慧和经验，为全球科研评价系统的改革和发展提供了价值的见解和参考

Abstract: The lack of a macro-level, systematic evaluation theory to guide the
implementation of evaluation practices has become a key bottleneck in the
reform of global research evaluation systems. By reviewing the historical
development of research evaluation, this paper highlights the current binary
opposition between qualitative and quantitative methods in evaluation
practices. This paper introduces the System of All-round Evaluation of Research
(SAER), a framework that integrates form, content, and utility evaluations with
six key elements. SAER offers a theoretical breakthrough by transcending the
binary, providing a comprehensive foundation for global evaluation reforms. The
comprehensive system proposes a trinity of three evaluation dimensions,
combined with six evaluation elements, which would help academic evaluators and
researchers reconcile binary oppositions in evaluation methods. The system
highlights the dialectical wisdom and experience embedded in Chinese research
evaluation theory, offering valuable insights and references for the reform and
advancement of global research evaluation systems.

TL;DR: EZR是一个轻量级多目标优化框架，通过主动学习和决策树解释，用更少但更信息丰富的样本实现高效优化和可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决软件工程中配置空间庞大、标注成本高的优化挑战，需要既高效又可解释的优化方法

Method: 基于朴素贝叶斯采样的主动学习策略，结合最大清晰度启发式，使用决策树提供全局和局部解释

Result: 在60个真实数据集上，EZR在大多数情况下达到超过90%的最佳优化性能，解释清晰度和实用性优于LIME、SHAP等标准XAI方法

Conclusion: "少而精"策略可行且优越，使用更少但更信息丰富的样本可以在软件系统中实现标签高效的优化和解释

Abstract: Efficient, interpretable optimization is a critical but underexplored
challenge in software engineering, where practitioners routinely face vast
configuration spaces and costly, error-prone labeling processes. This paper
introduces EZR, a novel and modular framework for multi-objective optimization
that unifies active sampling, learning, and explanation within a single,
lightweight pipeline. Departing from conventional wisdom, our Maximum Clarity
Heuristic demonstrates that using less (but more informative) data can yield
optimization models that are both effective and deeply understandable. EZR
employs an active learning strategy based on Naive Bayes sampling to
efficiently identify high-quality configurations with a fraction of the labels
required by fully supervised approaches. It then distills optimization logic
into concise decision trees, offering transparent, actionable explanations for
both global and local decision-making. Extensive experiments across 60
real-world datasets establish that EZR reliably achieves over 90% of the
best-known optimization performance in most cases, while providing clear,
cohort-based rationales that surpass standard attribution-based explainable AI
(XAI) methods (LIME, SHAP, BreakDown) in clarity and utility. These results
endorse "less but better"; it is both possible and often preferable to use
fewer (but more informative) examples to generate label-efficient optimization
and explanations in software systems. To support transparency and
reproducibility, all code and experimental materials are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在自动化Gym环境设置过程中成功率低、开销大，且无法充分利用GitHub上丰富的人类报告问题数据，需要一种能最大化利用现有Gym环境和GitHub issue解决历史的方法

Method: 提出SWE-Mirror管道：提取真实issue的语义精髓，将其镜像到另一个配置了Gym环境的代码库中，重新激活为可验证的issue解决任务

Result: 在4种语言的40个代码库中构建了60,671个issue解决任务的数据集，训练后的模型在issue解决能力上表现提升。扩展到12,000+高质量轨迹后，在OpenHands框架上建立了新的SOTA，SWE-Bench-Verified解决率提升21.8%(7B模型)和46.0%(32B模型)

Conclusion: SWE-Mirror有效利用了现有Gym环境和GitHub issue解决历史，构建了大规模可验证数据集，显著提升了代码代理的训练效果和issue解决能力

Abstract: Creating large-scale verifiable training datasets for issue-resolving tasks
is a critical yet notoriously difficult challenge. Existing methods on
automating the Gym environment setup process for real-world issues suffer from
low success rates and high overhead. Meanwhile, synthesizing new tasks within
existing Gym environments leaves the vast pool of authentic, human-reported
problems untapped. To maximize the utilization of existing Gym environments and
also the rich data of issue-resolving history on GitHub, we introduce
SWE-Mirror, a pipeline that distills a real-world issue's semantic essence,
mirrors it into another repository with a configured Gym environment, and
re-animates it as a verifiable issue-resolving task. SWE-Mirror reuses existing
Gym environments along with the vast pool of issue-resolving history hosted on
GitHub to construct a large-scale dataset of mirrored authentic and verifiable
tasks. Applying SWE-Mirror to 40 repositories across 4 languages, we have
curated a dataset with 60,671 issue-resolving tasks and demonstrated the value
of our dataset by training and evaluating coding agents at various scale.
Post-training experiments show that models trained with the dataset exhibit
improvements in issue-resolving capabilities. Furthermore, by extending the
dataset size to over 12,000 high-quality trajectories, we established a new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) among Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct based LLMs on the
OpenHands agent framework, which increases the resolve rate on
SWE-Bench-Verified by +21.8% for the 7B model and +46.0% for the 32B model and
validates the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 开放词汇构造问题的动态知识增强解析方法，通过专家提供的词典知识来提升模型对未知构造的处理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模型在处理自然语言规范转换为形式语言时遇到开放词汇构造(OVCs)的问题，因为模型缺乏对这些未知构造的先验知识

Method: 提出动态知识增强解析(DKAP)方法，包括ROLex检索增强解析器，通过维护一个动态增长的键值对词典来存储专家提供的知识，使用合成数据生成和数据增强技术训练模型

Result: 在三个形式化任务(NL2LTL、NL2Code、NL2CMD)上评估，证明DKAP是一个具有挑战性的问题，ROLex能够通过有效利用动态专家知识来提升基线模型的性能

Conclusion: 动态知识增强解析是一种有效的方法，可以在不重新训练模型的情况下，利用推理时专家提供的知识来改善对开放词汇构造的处理能力

Abstract: We study the problem of Open-Vocabulary Constructs(OVCs) -- ones not known
beforehand -- in the context of converting natural language (NL) specifications
into formal languages (e.g., temporal logic or code). Models fare poorly on
OVCs due to a lack of necessary knowledge a priori. In such situations, a
domain expert can provide correct constructs at inference time based on their
preferences or domain knowledge. Our goal is to effectively reuse this
inference-time, expert-provided knowledge for future parses without retraining
the model. We present dynamic knowledge-augmented parsing(DKAP), where in
addition to the input sentence, the model receives (dynamically growing) expert
knowledge as a key-value lexicon that associates NL phrases with correct OVC
constructs. We propose ROLex, a retrieval-augmented parsing approach that uses
this lexicon. A retriever and a generator are trained to find and use the
key-value store to produce the correct parse. A key challenge lies in curating
data for this retrieval-augmented parser. We utilize synthetic data generation
and the data augmentation techniques on annotated (NL sentence, FL statement)
pairs to train the augmented parser. To improve training effectiveness, we
propose multiple strategies to teach models to focus on the relevant subset of
retrieved knowledge. Finally, we introduce a new evaluation paradigm modeled
after the DKAP problem and simulate the scenario across three formalization
tasks (NL2LTL, NL2Code, and NL2CMD). Our evaluations show that DKAP is a
difficult challenge, and ROLex helps improve the performance of baseline models
by using dynamic expert knowledge effectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深作生成技术的快速发展对检测系统构成了重大挑战，非持续学习方法需要频繁且费用昂贵的重新训练。

Method: 提出了一种高效持续学习框架，基于轻量级视觉背榜网络，在7年时间距内模拟深作技术的真实历史演化。同时引入了两个新的评估指标：C-AUC和FWT-AUC。

Result: 实验结果显示，该框架能够实现高效适应（比全量重训练快155倍）和稳固的历史知识保留，但对未来生成器的普适性仍接近随机水平（FWT-AUC≈0.5）。

Conclusion: 研究证明了当前方法在没有额外训练的情况下对未来生成器的普适性有限，并基于此提出了非通用深作分布假设s。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of deepfake generation technologies poses critical
challenges for detection systems, as non-continual learning methods demand
frequent and expensive retraining. We reframe deepfake detection (DFD) as a
Continual Learning (CL) problem, proposing an efficient framework that
incrementally adapts to emerging visual manipulation techniques while retaining
knowledge of past generators. Our framework, unlike prior approaches that rely
on unreal simulation sequences, simulates the real-world chronological
evolution of deepfake technologies in extended periods across 7 years.
Simultaneously, our framework builds upon lightweight visual backbones to allow
for the real-time performance of DFD systems. Additionally, we contribute two
novel metrics: Continual AUC (C-AUC) for historical performance and Forward
Transfer AUC (FWT-AUC) for future generalization. Through extensive
experimentation (over 600 simulations), we empirically demonstrate that while
efficient adaptation (+155 times faster than full retraining) and robust
retention of historical knowledge is possible, the generalization of current
approaches to future generators without additional training remains near-random
(FWT-AUC $\approx$ 0.5) due to the unique imprint characterizing each existing
generator. Such observations are the foundation of our newly proposed
Non-Universal Deepfake Distribution Hypothesis.
  \textbf{Code will be released upon acceptance.}

Motivation: 现有不可学习方法生成的不可学习样本在跨任务场景下仍然有效，无法真正保护数据所有者权益，需要探究不可学习性的本质边界。

Method: 通过观察干净模型和中毒模型的收敛过程差异，分析损失景观特征，提出Sharpness-Aware Learnability (SAL)指标量化参数不可学习性，并基于此提出Unlearnable Distance (UD)来度量数据的不可学习性。

Result: 发现只有部分关键参数优化路径存在显著差异，损失景观与不可学习性密切相关，提出的UD指标能够有效评估现有不可学习方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 现有不可学习方法距离实现真正的不可学习样本还有差距，需要基于损失景观和优化路径的深入理解来开发更有效的保护方法。

Abstract: High-quality data plays an indispensable role in the era of large models, but
the use of unauthorized data for model training greatly damages the interests
of data owners. To overcome this threat, several unlearnable methods have been
proposed, which generate unlearnable examples (UEs) by compromising the
training availability of data. Clearly, due to unknown training purposes and
the powerful representation learning capabilities of existing models, these
data are expected to be unlearnable for models across multiple tasks, i.e.,
they will not help improve the model's performance. However, unexpectedly, we
find that on the multi-task dataset Taskonomy, UEs still perform well in tasks
such as semantic segmentation, failing to exhibit cross-task unlearnability.
This phenomenon leads us to question: How far are we from attaining truly
unlearnable examples? We attempt to answer this question from the perspective
of model optimization. To this end, we observe the difference in the
convergence process between clean and poisoned models using a simple model
architecture. Subsequently, from the loss landscape we find that only a part of
the critical parameter optimization paths show significant differences,
implying a close relationship between the loss landscape and unlearnability.
Consequently, we employ the loss landscape to explain the underlying reasons
for UEs and propose Sharpness-Aware Learnability (SAL) to quantify the
unlearnability of parameters based on this explanation. Furthermore, we propose
an Unlearnable Distance (UD) to measure the unlearnability of data based on the
SAL distribution of parameters in clean and poisoned models. Finally, we
conduct benchmark tests on mainstream unlearnable methods using the proposed
UD, aiming to promote community awareness of the capability boundaries of
existing unlearnable methods.

Abstract: We present JEL, a novel computationally efficient end-to-end multi-neural
network based entity linking model, which beats current state-of-art model.
Knowledge Graphs have emerged as a compelling abstraction for capturing
critical relationships among the entities of interest and integrating data from
multiple heterogeneous sources. A core problem in leveraging a knowledge graph
is linking its entities to the mentions (e.g., people, company names) that are
encountered in textual sources (e.g., news, blogs., etc) correctly, since there
are thousands of entities to consider for each mention. This task of linking
mentions and entities is referred as Entity Linking (EL). It is a fundamental
task in natural language processing and is beneficial in various uses cases,
such as building a New Analytics platform. News Analytics, in JPMorgan, is an
essential task that benefits multiple groups across the firm. According to a
survey conducted by the Innovation Digital team 1 , around 25 teams across the
firm are actively looking for news analytics solutions, and more than \$2
million is being spent annually on external vendor costs. Entity linking is
critical for bridging unstructured news text with knowledge graphs, enabling
users access to vast amounts of curated data in a knowledge graph and
dramatically facilitating their daily work.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) represent an emerging paradigm
within artificial intelligence, with applications throughout the medical
enterprise. Assessing GenAI applications necessitates a comprehensive
understanding of the clinical task and awareness of the variability in
performance when implemented in actual clinical environments. Presently, a
prevalent method for evaluating the performance of generative models relies on
quantitative benchmarks. Such benchmarks have limitations and may suffer from
train-to-the-test overfitting, optimizing performance for a specified test set
at the cost of generalizability across other task and data distributions.
Evaluation strategies leveraging human expertise and utilizing cost-effective
computational models as evaluators are gaining interest. We discuss current
state-of-the-art methodologies for assessing the performance of GenAI
applications in healthcare and medical devices.

Motivation: 分布式学习设置中存在后门攻击风险，现有防御方法在面对适应性攻击者时效果不佳，需要更加强大的防御策略。

Method: 首先设计了一种新的适应性攻击者模型，然后提出了Hammer和Anvil组合防御方法，该方法结合了两种基础原理相互正交的防御技术。

Result: 新的适应性攻击者只需要1-2个恶意客户即可突破现有最佳防御方法；而新提出的Krum+组合防御能够有效拦截这些攻击。

Conclusion: 通过组合不同防御原理的方法，可以构建更加健壮的防御系统来应对适应性后门攻击，Krum+在实验中表现出艾。

Abstract: Federated Learning is a distributed learning technique in which multiple
clients cooperate to train a machine learning model. Distributed settings
facilitate backdoor attacks by malicious clients, who can embed malicious
behaviors into the model during their participation in the training process.
These malicious behaviors are activated during inference by a specific trigger.
No defense against backdoor attacks has stood the test of time, especially
against adaptive attackers, a powerful but not fully explored category of
attackers. In this work, we first devise a new adaptive adversary that
surpasses existing adversaries in capabilities, yielding attacks that only
require one or two malicious clients out of 20 to break existing
state-of-the-art defenses. Then, we present Hammer and Anvil, a principled
defense approach that combines two defenses orthogonal in their underlying
principle to produce a combined defense that, given the right set of
parameters, must succeed against any attack. We show that our best combined
defense, Krum+, is successful against our new adaptive adversary and
state-of-the-art attacks.

Result: 在Chapman、Georgia两个公共数据集和私有ICU数据集上测试，PhysioCLR相比最强基线平均AUROC提升12%，展现出强大的跨数据集泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过将生理学知识嵌入对比学习，PhysioCLR能够学习具有临床意义且可迁移的ECG特征，为更有效和标签高效的心电图诊断提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Objective: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) play a crucial role in diagnosing heart
conditions; however, the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI)-based
ECG analysis is often hindered by the limited availability of labeled data.
Self-supervised learning (SSL) can address this by leveraging large-scale
unlabeled data. We introduce PhysioCLR (Physiology-aware Contrastive Learning
Representation for ECG), a physiology-aware contrastive learning framework that
incorporates domain-specific priors to enhance the generalizability and
clinical relevance of ECG-based arrhythmia classification. Methods: During
pretraining, PhysioCLR learns to bring together embeddings of samples that
share similar clinically relevant features while pushing apart those that are
dissimilar. Unlike existing methods, our method integrates ECG physiological
similarity cues into contrastive learning, promoting the learning of clinically
meaningful representations. Additionally, we introduce ECG- specific
augmentations that preserve the ECG category post augmentation and propose a
hybrid loss function to further refine the quality of learned representations.
Results: We evaluate PhysioCLR on two public ECG datasets, Chapman and Georgia,
for multilabel ECG diagnoses, as well as a private ICU dataset labeled for
binary classification. Across the Chapman, Georgia, and private cohorts,
PhysioCLR boosts the mean AUROC by 12% relative to the strongest baseline,
underscoring its robust cross-dataset generalization. Conclusion: By embedding
physiological knowledge into contrastive learning, PhysioCLR enables the model
to learn clinically meaningful and transferable ECG eatures. Significance:
PhysioCLR demonstrates the potential of physiology-informed SSL to offer a
promising path toward more effective and label-efficient ECG diagnostics.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a novel, multidisciplinary Machine Learning
paradigm where multiple clients, such as mobile devices, collaborate to solve
machine learning problems. Initially introduced in Kone{\v{c}}n{\'y} et al.
(2016a,b); McMahan et al. (2017), FL has gained further attention through its
inclusion in the National AI Research and Development Strategic Plan (2023
Update) of the United States (Science and on Artificial Intelligence, 2023).
The FL training process is inherently decentralized and often takes place in
less controlled settings compared to data centers, posing unique challenges
distinct from those in fully controlled environments. In this thesis, we
identify five key challenges in Federated Learning and propose novel approaches
to address them. These challenges arise from the heterogeneity of data and
devices, communication issues, and privacy concerns for clients in FL training.
Moreover, even well-established theoretical advances in FL require diverse
forms of practical implementation to enhance their real-world applicability.
Our contributions advance FL algorithms and systems, bridging theoretical
advancements and practical implementations. More broadly, our work serves as a
guide for researchers navigating the complexities of translating theoretical
methods into efficient real-world implementations and software. Additionally,
it offers insights into the reverse process of adapting practical
implementation aspects back into theoretical algorithm design. This reverse
process is particularly intriguing, as the practical perspective compels us to
examine the underlying mechanics and flexibilities of algorithms more deeply,
often uncovering new dimensions of the algorithms under study.

Abstract: The starting point of our network architecture is the Credibility Transformer
which extends the classical Transformer architecture by a credibility mechanism
to improve model learning and predictive performance. This Credibility
Transformer learns credibilitized CLS tokens that serve as learned
representations of the original input features. In this paper we present a new
paradigm that augments this architecture by an in-context learning mechanism,
i.e., we increase the information set by a context batch consisting of similar
instances. This allows the model to enhance the CLS token representations of
the instances by additional in-context information and fine-tuning. We
empirically verify that this in-context learning enhances predictive accuracy
by adapting to similar risk patterns. Moreover, this in-context learning also
allows the model to generalize to new instances which, e.g., have feature
levels in the categorical covariates that have not been present when the model
was trained -- for a relevant example, think of a new vehicle model which has
just been developed by a car manufacturer.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for predicting rare, high-impact outcomes by
integrating large language models (LLMs) with a multi-model machine learning
(ML) architecture. The approach combines the predictive strength of black-box
models with the interpretability required for reliable decision-making. We use
LLM-powered feature engineering to extract and synthesize complex signals from
unstructured data, which are then processed within a layered ensemble of models
including XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression. The ensemble first
produces a continuous estimate of success likelihood, which is then thresholded
to produce a binary rare-event prediction. We apply this framework to the
domain of Venture Capital (VC), where investors must evaluate startups with
limited and noisy early-stage data. The empirical results show strong
performance: the model achieves precision between 9.8X and 11.1X the random
classifier baseline in three independent test subsets. Feature sensitivity
analysis further reveals interpretable success drivers: the startup's category
list accounts for 15.6% of predictive influence, followed by the number of
founders, while education level and domain expertise contribute smaller yet
consistent effects.

Abstract: Fairness-aware classification requires balancing performance and fairness,
often intensified by intersectional biases. Conflicting fairness definitions
further complicate the task, making it difficult to identify universally fair
solutions. Despite growing regulatory and societal demands for equitable AI,
popular toolkits offer limited support for exploring multi-dimensional fairness
and related trade-offs. To address this, we present mmm-fair, an open-source
toolkit leveraging boosting-based ensemble approaches that dynamically
optimizes model weights to jointly minimize classification errors and diverse
fairness violations, enabling flexible multi-objective optimization. The system
empowers users to deploy models that align with their context-specific needs
while reliably uncovering intersectional biases often missed by
state-of-the-art methods. In a nutshell, mmm-fair uniquely combines in-depth
multi-attribute fairness, multi-objective optimization, a no-code, chat-based
interface, LLM-powered explanations, interactive Pareto exploration for model
selection, custom fairness constraint definition, and deployment-ready models
in a single open-source toolkit, a combination rarely found in existing
fairness tools. Demo walkthrough available at: https://youtu.be/_rcpjlXFqkw.

Conclusion: 该框架为处理多个保护属性的公平性问题提供了有效解决方案，特别是在回归任务中对付连续性属性和交叉子群体偏见的处理。

Abstract: Ensuring equitable treatment (fairness) across protected attributes (such as
gender or ethnicity) is a critical issue in machine learning. Most existing
literature focuses on binary classification, but achieving fairness in
regression tasks-such as insurance pricing or hiring score assessments-is
equally important. Moreover, anti-discrimination laws also apply to continuous
attributes, such as age, for which many existing methods are not applicable. In
practice, multiple protected attributes can exist simultaneously; however,
methods targeting fairness across several attributes often overlook so-called
"fairness gerrymandering", thereby ignoring disparities among intersectional
subgroups (e.g., African-American women or Hispanic men). In this paper, we
propose a distance covariance regularisation framework that mitigates the
association between model predictions and protected attributes, in line with
the fairness definition of demographic parity, and that captures both linear
and nonlinear dependencies. To enhance applicability in the presence of
multiple protected attributes, we extend our framework by incorporating two
multivariate dependence measures based on distance covariance: the previously
proposed joint distance covariance (JdCov) and our novel concatenated distance
covariance (CCdCov), which effectively address fairness gerrymandering in both
regression and classification tasks involving protected attributes of various
types. We discuss and illustrate how to calibrate regularisation strength,
including a method based on Jensen-Shannon divergence, which quantifies
dissimilarities in prediction distributions across groups. We apply our
framework to the COMPAS recidivism dataset and a large motor insurance claims
dataset.

Result: 在多个合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，MARLINE比几种最先进的数据流学习方法更准确

Conclusion: MARLINE能够有效处理非平稳环境中的概念漂移问题，即使源概念和目标概念不匹配也能从多源知识中受益

Abstract: Concept drift is a major problem in online learning due to its impact on the
predictive performance of data stream mining systems. Recent studies have
started exploring data streams from different sources as a strategy to tackle
concept drift in a given target domain. These approaches make the assumption
that at least one of the source models represents a concept similar to the
target concept, which may not hold in many real-world scenarios. In this paper,
we propose a novel approach called Multi-source mApping with tRansfer LearnIng
for Non-stationary Environments (MARLINE). MARLINE can benefit from knowledge
from multiple data sources in non-stationary environments even when source and
target concepts do not match. This is achieved by projecting the target concept
to the space of each source concept, enabling multiple source sub-classifiers
to contribute towards the prediction of the target concept as part of an
ensemble. Experiments on several synthetic and real-world datasets show that
MARLINE was more accurate than several state-of-the-art data stream learning
approaches.

Abstract: Label concepts in multi-label data streams often experience drift in
non-stationary environments, either independently or in relation to other
labels. Transferring knowledge between related labels can accelerate
adaptation, yet research on multi-label transfer learning for data streams
remains limited. To address this, we propose two novel transfer learning
methods: BR-MARLENE leverages knowledge from different labels in both source
and target streams for multi-label classification; BRPW-MARLENE builds on this
by explicitly modelling and transferring pairwise label dependencies to enhance
learning performance. Comprehensive experiments show that both methods
outperform state-of-the-art multi-label stream approaches in non-stationary

Method: 使用具有不同滞后的交错马尔可夫链，保持转移概率固定但变化因果结构，通过3层Transformer实现选择性归纳头机制。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了Transformer选择因果结构的能力，为理解其功能和可解释性提供了新见解，推进了对归纳头机制的理解。

Abstract: Transformers have exhibited exceptional capabilities in sequence modeling
tasks, leveraging self-attention and in-context learning. Critical to this
success are induction heads, attention circuits that enable copying tokens
based on their previous occurrences. In this work, we introduce a novel
framework that showcases transformers' ability to dynamically handle causal
structures. Existing works rely on Markov Chains to study the formation of
induction heads, revealing how transformers capture causal dependencies and
learn transition probabilities in-context. However, they rely on a fixed causal
structure that fails to capture the complexity of natural languages, where the
relationship between tokens dynamically changes with context. To this end, our
framework varies the causal structure through interleaved Markov chains with
different lags while keeping the transition probabilities fixed. This setting
unveils the formation of Selective Induction Heads, a new circuit that endows
transformers with the ability to select the correct causal structure
in-context. We empirically demonstrate that transformers learn this mechanism
to predict the next token by identifying the correct lag and copying the
corresponding token from the past. We provide a detailed construction of a
3-layer transformer to implement the selective induction head, and a
theoretical analysis proving that this mechanism asymptotically converges to
the maximum likelihood solution. Our findings advance the understanding of how
transformers select causal structures, providing new insights into their
functioning and interpretability.

Abstract: Artifacts in electroencephalography (EEG) -- muscle, eye movement, electrode,
chewing, and shiver -- confound automated analysis yet are costly to label at
scale. We study whether modern generative models can synthesize realistic,
label-aware artifact segments suitable for augmentation and stress-testing.
Using the TUH EEG Artifact (TUAR) corpus, we curate subject-wise splits and
fixed-length multi-channel windows (e.g., 250 samples) with preprocessing
tailored to each model (per-window min-max for adversarial training;
per-recording/channel $z$-score for diffusion). We compare a conditional
WGAN-GP with a projection discriminator to a 1D denoising diffusion model with
classifier-free guidance, and evaluate along three axes: (i) fidelity via Welch
band-power deltas ($\Delta\delta,\ \Delta\theta,\ \Delta\alpha,\ \Delta\beta$),
channel-covariance Frobenius distance, autocorrelation $L_2$, and
distributional metrics (MMD/PRD); (ii) specificity via class-conditional
recovery with lightweight $k$NN/classifiers; and (iii) utility via augmentation
effects on artifact recognition. In our setting, WGAN-GP achieves closer
spectral alignment and lower MMD to real data, while both models exhibit weak
class-conditional recovery, limiting immediate augmentation gains and revealing
opportunities for stronger conditioning and coverage. We release a reproducible
pipeline -- data manifests, training configurations, and evaluation scripts --
to establish a baseline for EEG artifact synthesis and to surface actionable
failure modes for future work.

Abstract: Solving complex partial differential equations is vital in the physical
sciences, but often requires computationally expensive numerical methods.
Reduced-order models (ROMs) address this by exploiting dimensionality reduction
to create fast approximations. While modern ROMs can solve parameterized
families of PDEs, their predictive power degrades over long time horizons. We
address this by (1) introducing a flexible, high-order, yet inexpensive
finite-difference scheme and (2) proposing a Rollout loss that trains ROMs to
make accurate predictions over arbitrary time horizons. We demonstrate our
approach on the 2D Burgers equation.

Abstract: We address the problem of policy selection in contextual stochastic
optimization (CSO), where covariates are available as contextual information
and decisions must satisfy hard feasibility constraints. In many CSO settings,
multiple candidate policies--arising from different modeling paradigms--exhibit
heterogeneous performance across the covariate space, with no single policy
uniformly dominating. We propose Prescribe-then-Select (PS), a modular
framework that first constructs a library of feasible candidate policies and
then learns a meta-policy to select the best policy for the observed
covariates. We implement the meta-policy using ensembles of Optimal Policy
Trees trained via cross-validation on the training set, making policy choice
entirely data-driven. Across two benchmark CSO problems--single-stage
newsvendor and two-stage shipment planning--PS consistently outperforms the
best single policy in heterogeneous regimes of the covariate space and
converges to the dominant policy when such heterogeneity is absent. All the

TL;DR: 本文提出了Sketched Gaussian Mechanism (SGM)，将梯度压缩的sketching技术与高斯机制结合，在联邦学习中同时解决通信成本和隐私保护问题，并通过联合分析获得了比单独分析更优的隐私保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中的通信成本和隐私保护是两个重要问题。现有研究通常单独分析sketching技术和高斯机制的隐私保护效果，缺乏对两者结合的综合分析。

Method: 提出SGM机制，直接结合sketching和高斯机制，使用Rényi-DP工具进行联合隐私分析，证明隐私级别与sketching维度b的平方根成反比。

Result: 理论证明SGM在相同噪声预算下能提供比原始高斯机制更强的隐私保证，实验显示在相同隐私级别下，基于SGM的联邦学习性能至少与非sketching的私有FL变体相当，在某些设置下更优。

Conclusion: SGM机制有效结合了sketching和高斯机制的优势，在保持通信效率的同时提供了更强的隐私保护，且服务器端使用自适应优化能进一步提升性能而不影响隐私保证。

Abstract: Communication cost and privacy are two major considerations in federated
learning (FL). For communication cost, gradient compression by sketching the
clients' transmitted model updates is often used for reducing per-round
communication. For privacy, the Gaussian mechanism (GM), which consists of
clipping updates and adding Gaussian noise, is commonly used to guarantee
client-level differential privacy. Existing literature on private FL analyzes
privacy of sketching and GM in an isolated manner, illustrating that sketching
provides privacy determined by the sketching dimension and that GM has to
supply any additional desired privacy.
  In this paper, we introduce the Sketched Gaussian Mechanism (SGM), which
directly combines sketching and the Gaussian mechanism for privacy. Using
R\'enyi-DP tools, we present a joint analysis of SGM's overall privacy
guarantee, which is significantly more flexible and sharper compared to
isolated analysis of sketching and GM privacy. In particular, we prove that the
privacy level of SGM for a fixed noise magnitude is proportional to
$1/\sqrt{b}$, where $b$ is the sketching dimension, indicating that (for
moderate $b$) SGM can provide much stronger privacy guarantees than the
original GM under the same noise budget. We demonstrate the application of SGM
to FL with either gradient descent or adaptive server optimizers, and establish
theoretical results on optimization convergence, which exhibits only a
logarithmic dependence on the number of parameters $d$. Experimental results
confirm that at the same privacy level, SGM based FL is at least competitive
with non-sketching private FL variants and outperforms them in some settings.
Moreover, using adaptive optimization at the server improves empirical
performance while maintaining the privacy guarantees.

Abstract: Distributed and federated learning are essential paradigms for training
models across decentralized data sources while preserving privacy, yet
communication overhead remains a major bottleneck. This dissertation explores
strategies to improve communication efficiency, focusing on model compression,
local training, and personalization. We establish a unified framework for
biased and unbiased compression operators with convergence guarantees, then
propose adaptive local training strategies that incorporate personalization to
accelerate convergence and mitigate client drift. In particular, Scafflix
balances global and personalized objectives, achieving superior performance
under both IID and non-IID settings. We further introduce privacy-preserving
pruning frameworks that optimize sparsity while minimizing communication costs,
with Cohort-Squeeze leveraging hierarchical aggregation to reduce cross-device
overhead. Finally, SymWanda, a symmetric post-training pruning method, enhances
robustness under high sparsity and maintains accuracy without retraining.
Extensive experiments on benchmarks and large-scale language models demonstrate
favorable trade-offs among accuracy, convergence, and communication, offering
theoretical and practical insights for scalable, efficient distributed

Abstract: While existing critical care EHR datasets such as MIMIC and eICU have enabled
significant advances in clinical AI research, the CRITICAL dataset opens new
frontiers by providing extensive scale and diversity -- containing 1.95 billion
records from 371,365 patients across four geographically diverse CTSA
institutions. CRITICAL's unique strength lies in capturing full-spectrum
patient journeys, including pre-ICU, ICU, and post-ICU encounters across both
inpatient and outpatient settings. This multi-institutional, longitudinal
perspective creates transformative opportunities for developing generalizable
predictive models and advancing health equity research. However, the richness

usage patterns requiring sophisticated preprocessing approaches.
  We present CRISP to unlock the full potential of this valuable resource.
CRISP systematically transforms raw Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership
Common Data Model data into ML-ready datasets through: (1) transparent data
quality management with comprehensive audit trails, (2) cross-vocabulary
mapping of heterogeneous medical terminologies to unified SNOMED-CT standards,
with deduplication and unit standardization, (3) modular architecture with
parallel optimization enabling complete dataset processing in $<$1 day even on
standard computing hardware, and (4) comprehensive baseline model benchmarks
spanning multiple clinical prediction tasks to establish reproducible
performance standards. By providing processing pipeline, baseline
implementations, and detailed transformation documentation, CRISP saves
researchers months of preprocessing effort and democratizes access to
large-scale multi-institutional critical care data, enabling them to focus on
advancing clinical AI.

Motivation: 大语言模型在微调时面临灾难性遗忘问题，需要平衡遗忘与下游任务性能

Method: 使用任务向量与预训练参数的比例作为剪枝度量，无需修改训练过程或模型架构，也不需要辅助数据

Conclusion: FAPM是一种有效的剪枝方法，能够显著减轻灾难性遗忘问题，同时保持优异的下游任务性能

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive
capabilities in various downstream tasks but typically face Catastrophic
Forgetting (CF) during fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose the
Forgetting-Aware Pruning Metric (FAPM), a novel pruning-based approach to
balance CF and downstream task performance. Our investigation reveals that the
degree to which task vectors (i.e., the subtraction of pre-trained weights from
the weights fine-tuned on downstream tasks) overlap with pre-trained model
parameters is a critical factor for CF. Based on this finding, FAPM employs the
ratio of the task vector to pre-trained model parameters as a metric to
quantify CF, integrating this measure into the pruning criteria. Importantly,
FAPM does not necessitate modifications to the training process or model
architecture, nor does it require any auxiliary data. We conducted extensive
experiments across eight datasets, covering natural language inference, General
Q&A, Medical Q&A, Math Q&A, reading comprehension, and cloze tests. The results
demonstrate that FAPM limits CF to just 0.25\% while maintaining 99.67\%
accuracy on downstream tasks. We provide the code to reproduce our results.

Result: 对4个最先进的VLMs进行了全面评估，显示模型规模与推理能力存在强相关关系，最佳模型Qwen2.5-VL-7B达到了0.815的总体分数。模型在公式化问题上表现优异，但在需要抽象空间推理的领域面临显著困难。

Conclusion: 通过设计这个框架，目标是促进VLMs科学推理能力的研究普及化，并深入探索模型的能力和局限性。

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) grow in sophistication, their ability to
perform reasoning is coming under increasing supervision. While they excel at
many tasks, their grasp of fundamental scientific principles, such as physics,
remains an underexplored frontier. To reflect the advancements in these
capabilities, we introduce a novel and accessible framework designed to
rigorously evaluate VLMs on their understanding of 2D physics. Our framework
features a pragmatic scenario generator that creates a diverse testbed of over
400 problems across four core domains: Projectile Motion, Collision Dynamics,
Mechanics, and Fluid Dynamics. Through comprehensive evaluation of four
state-of-the-art VLMs, we demonstrate a strong correlation between model scale
and reasoning ability, with our top-performing model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, achieving
an overall score of 0.815. We find that while models excel at formulaic
problems, they struggle significantly with domains requiring abstract spatial
reasoning. By designing this framework, we aim to democratize the study of
scientific reasoning in VLMs and foster deeper insights into their capabilities
and limitations.

Result: 在越南8个主要流域和5个预测时间尺度上，MPWE相比地理模型和集成基线方法，预测误差的均值和标准差均显著降低。

Conclusion: MPWE框架能够有效提升降雨预测的准确性和稳定性，适用于不同流域和预测时间尺度，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Rainfall forecasting in Vietnam is highly challenging due to its diverse
climatic conditions and strong geographical variability across river basins,
yet accurate and reliable forecasts are vital for flood management, hydropower
operation, and disaster preparedness. In this work, we propose a Matrix
Profile-based Weighted Ensemble (MPWE), a regime-switching framework that
dynamically captures covariant dependencies among multiple geographical model
forecasts while incorporating redundancy-aware weighting to balance
contributions across models. We evaluate MPWE using rainfall forecasts from
eight major basins in Vietnam, spanning five forecast horizons (1 hour and
accumulated rainfall over 12, 24, 48, 72, and 84 hours). Experimental results
show that MPWE consistently achieves lower mean and standard deviation of
prediction errors compared to geographical models and ensemble baselines,
demonstrating both improved accuracy and stability across basins and horizons.

Conclusion: FoQuS方法有效解决了大规模数据训练的高开销问题，为AMR模型的快速开发和优化提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning-based Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) model has made
significant progress with the support of large-scale labeled data. However,
when developing new models or performing hyperparameter tuning, the time and
energy consumption associated with repeated training using massive amounts of
data are often unbearable. To address the above challenges, we propose
\emph{FoQuS}, which approximates the effect of full training by selecting a
coreset from the original dataset, thereby significantly reducing training
overhead. Specifically, \emph{FoQuS} records the prediction trajectory of each
sample during full-dataset training and constructs three importance metrics
based on training dynamics. Experiments show that \emph{FoQuS} can maintain
high recognition accuracy and good cross-architecture generalization on
multiple AMR datasets using only 1\%-30\% of the original data.

TL;DR: EvolKV是一个自适应KV缓存压缩框架，通过进化搜索动态配置各层预算，在保持任务性能的同时显著提升内存效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法依赖启发式策略，忽略了层间特征模式与任务性能的关键交互，导致泛化性能下降

Method: 将缓存分配重构为多目标优化问题，利用进化搜索动态配置各层预算，直接最大化下游任务性能

Result: 在11个任务上超越所有基线方法，在GSM8K上比启发式基线提升7个百分点，仅用1.5%原始预算就在代码补全上超越完整KV缓存

Conclusion: 学习型压缩策略在KV缓存预算分配方面具有巨大潜力，EvolKV展示了自适应层间压缩的有效性

Abstract: Existing key-value (KV) cache compression methods typically rely on
heuristics, such as uniform cache allocation across layers or static eviction
policies, however, they ignore the critical interplays among layer-specific
feature patterns and task performance, which can lead to degraded
generalization. In this paper, we propose EvolKV, an adaptive framework for
layer-wise, task-driven KV cache compression that jointly optimizes the memory
efficiency and task performance. By reformulating cache allocation as a
multi-objective optimization problem, EvolKV leverages evolutionary search to
dynamically configure layer budgets while directly maximizing downstream
performance. Extensive experiments on 11 tasks demonstrate that our approach
outperforms all baseline methods across a wide range of KV cache budgets on
long-context tasks and surpasses heuristic baselines by up to 7 percentage
points on GSM8K. Notably, EvolKV achieves superior performance over the full KV
cache setting on code completion while utilizing only 1.5% of the original
budget, suggesting the untapped potential in learned compression strategies for
KV cache budget allocation.

TL;DR: 使用预训练大语言模型作为导师，通过学生-教师架构加速强化学习算法的收敛速度，实验表明LLM指导能显著减少训练时间并保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习算法在复杂稀疏奖励环境中需要长时间训练，现有加速方法如奖励塑形和课程学习需要专业领域知识且过于特定。

Method: 采用学生-教师架构，使用LLM（Llama、Vicuna、DeepSeek）作为导师为RL算法（DQN、PPO、A2C）提供指导，并在三个环境（Blackjack、Snake、Connect Four）中进行54种配置的实验，探索建议重用机制的效果。

Result: LLM指导显著加速RL收敛，同时保持可比的最优性能。建议重用机制进一步缩短训练时间，但导致收敛动态不太稳定。效果对具体任务、RL算法和LLM模型组合敏感。

Conclusion: LLM作为导师能有效加速强化学习收敛，但其效果受多种因素影响，建议重用虽然能进一步加速但会降低稳定性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms often require long training to become
useful, especially in complex environments with sparse rewards. While
techniques like reward shaping and curriculum learning exist to accelerate
training, these are often extremely specific and require the developer's
professionalism and dedicated expertise in the problem's domain. Tackling this
challenge, in this study, we explore the effectiveness of pre-trained Large
Language Models (LLMs) as tutors in a student-teacher architecture with RL
algorithms, hypothesizing that LLM-generated guidance allows for faster
convergence. In particular, we explore the effectiveness of reusing the LLM's
advice on the RL's convergence dynamics. Through an extensive empirical
examination, which included 54 configurations, varying the RL algorithm (DQN,
PPO, A2C), LLM tutor (Llama, Vicuna, DeepSeek), and environment (Blackjack,
Snake, Connect Four), our results demonstrate that LLM tutoring significantly
accelerates RL convergence while maintaining comparable optimal performance.
Furthermore, the advice reuse mechanism shows a further improvement in training
duration but also results in less stable convergence dynamics. Our findings
suggest that LLM tutoring generally improves convergence, and its effectiveness
is sensitive to the specific task, RL algorithm, and LLM model combination.

Motivation: 现有的MoE模型参数庞大，GPU内存需求高，专家缓存命中率低且加载延迟大，限制了MoE LLMs的广泛应用

Method: 提出垂直分割专家为上下两段，缓存热门专家的上段以提高缓存命中率；预测下一层激活专家并预取；基于定点迭代的自适应缓存配置算法

Result: 实验表明MoEpic可节省约一半GPU成本，推理延迟降低37.51%-65.73%

Conclusion: MoEpic通过创新的专家分割和缓存策略，有效解决了MoE推理中的内存和性能瓶颈问题

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising architecture for modern
large language models (LLMs). However, massive parameters impose heavy GPU
memory (i.e., VRAM) demands, hindering the widespread adoption of MoE LLMs.
Offloading the expert parameters to CPU RAM offers an effective way to
alleviate the VRAM requirements for MoE inference. Existing approaches
typically cache a small subset of experts in VRAM and dynamically prefetch
experts from RAM during inference, leading to significant degradation in
inference speed due to the poor cache hit rate and substantial expert loading
latency. In this work, we propose MoEpic, an efficient MoE inference system
with a novel expert split mechanism. Specifically, each expert is vertically
divided into two segments: top and bottom. MoEpic caches the top segment of hot
experts, so that more experts will be stored under the limited VRAM budget,
thereby improving the cache hit rate. During each layer's inference, MoEpic
predicts and prefetches the activated experts for the next layer. Since the top
segments of cached experts are exempt from fetching, the loading time is
reduced, which allows efficient transfer-computation overlap. Nevertheless, the
performance of MoEpic critically depends on the cache configuration (i.e., each
layer's VRAM budget and expert split ratio). To this end, we propose a
divide-and-conquer algorithm based on fixed-point iteration for adaptive cache
configuration. Extensive experiments on popular MoE LLMs demonstrate that
MoEpic can save about half of the GPU cost, while lowering the inference
latency by about 37.51%-65.73% compared to the baselines.

Motivation: 传统PFL方法忽视下游决策质量，而DFL方法虽然直接优化决策质量但存在收敛不稳定问题，需要结合两者优势

Method: 使用预测损失梯度扰动决策损失梯度来构建更新方向，采用sigmoid类衰减参数让预测损失梯度引导决策损失梯度训练

Result: 在三个随机优化问题上验证了方法的有效性，相比基线方法实现了更低的regret和更稳定的训练

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外训练即可集成到任何DFL求解器中，在PFL或DFL单独表现不佳的情况下仍能取得良好效果

Abstract: Decision-making under uncertainty is often considered in two stages:
predicting the unknown parameters, and then optimizing decisions based on
predictions. While traditional prediction-focused learning (PFL) treats these
two stages separately, decision-focused learning (DFL) trains the predictive
model by directly optimizing the decision quality in an end-to-end manner.
However, despite using exact or well-approximated gradients, vanilla DFL often
suffers from unstable convergence due to its flat-and-sharp loss landscapes. In
contrast, PFL yields more stable optimization, but overlooks the downstream
decision quality. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective approach:
perturbing the decision loss gradient using the prediction loss gradient to
construct an update direction. Our method requires no additional training and
can be integrated with any DFL solvers. Using the sigmoid-like decaying
parameter, we let the prediction loss gradient guide the decision loss gradient
to train a predictive model that optimizes decision quality. Also, we provide a
theoretical convergence guarantee to Pareto stationary point under mild
assumptions. Empirically, we demonstrate our method across three stochastic
optimization problems, showing promising results compared to other baselines.
We validate that our approach achieves lower regret with more stable training,
even in situations where either PFL or DFL struggles.

Result: 实验结果表明VFM能有效缓解域差距、类别不平衡和非IID数据问题，显著提高整体准确率。

Conclusion: 强大的特征提取器比复杂的域适应或联邦学习方法更重要，预训练基础模型是解决现实世界联邦学习问题的关键。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a framework for training models
collaboratively while preserving data privacy of each client. Recently,
research has focused on Federated Source-Free Domain Adaptation (FFREEDA), a
more realistic scenario wherein client-held target domain data remains
unlabeled, and the server can access source domain data only during
pre-training. We extend this framework to a more complex and realistic setting:
Class Imbalanced FFREEDA (CI-FFREEDA), which takes into account class
imbalances in both the source and target domains, as well as label shifts
between source and target and among target clients. The replication of existing
methods in our experimental setup lead us to rethink the focus from enhancing
aggregation and domain adaptation methods to improving the feature extractors
within the network itself. We propose replacing the FFREEDA backbone with a
frozen vision foundation model (VFM), thereby improving overall accuracy
without extensive parameter tuning and reducing computational and communication
costs in federated learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that VFMs
effectively mitigate the effects of domain gaps, class imbalances, and even
non-IID-ness among target clients, suggesting that strong feature extractors,
not complex adaptation or FL methods, are key to success in the real-world FL.

Conclusion: 这些多项式技术为隐私保护设置中的安全文本生成提供了实用的解决方案，具有不可微的序列级优化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) power modern AI applications, but processing
sensitive data on untrusted servers raises privacy concerns. Homomorphic
encryption (HE) enables computation on encrypted data for secure inference.
However, neural text generation requires decoding methods like argmax and
sampling, which are non-polynomial and thus computationally expensive under
encryption, creating a significant performance bottleneck. We introduce cutmax,
an HE-friendly argmax algorithm that reduces ciphertext operations compared to
prior methods, enabling practical greedy decoding under encryption. We also
propose the first HE-compatible nucleus (top-p) sampling method, leveraging
cutmax for efficient stochastic decoding with provable privacy guarantees. Both
techniques are polynomial, supporting efficient inference in privacy-preserving
settings. Moreover, their differentiability facilitates gradient-based
sequence-level optimization as a polynomial alternative to straight-through
estimators. We further provide strong theoretical guarantees for cutmax,
proving it converges globally to a unique two-level fixed point, independent of
the input values beyond the identity of the maximizer, which explains its rapid
convergence in just a few iterations. Evaluations on realistic LLM outputs show
latency reductions of 24x-35x over baselines, advancing secure text generation.

Abstract: Graph foundation models, inspired by the success of LLMs, are designed to
learn the optimal embedding from multi-domain TAGs for the downstream
cross-task generalization capability. During our investigation, graph VQ-MAE
stands out among the increasingly diverse landscape of GFM architectures. This
is attributed to its ability to jointly encode topology and textual attributes
from multiple domains into discrete embedding spaces with clear semantic
boundaries. Despite its potential, domain generalization conflicts cause
imperceptible pitfalls. In this paper, we instantiate two of them, and they are
just like two sides of the same GFM optimization coin - Side 1 Model
Degradation: The encoder and codebook fail to capture the diversity of inputs;
Side 2 Representation Collapse: The hidden embedding and codebook vector fail
to preserve semantic separability due to constraints from narrow representation
subspaces. These two pitfalls (sides) collectively impair the decoder and
generate the low-quality reconstructed supervision, causing the GFM
optimization dilemma during pre-training (coin). Through empirical
investigation, we attribute the above challenges to Information Bottleneck and
Regularization Deficit. To address them, we propose MoT (Mixture-of-Tinkers) -
(1) Information Tinker for Two Pitfalls, which utilizes an edge-wise semantic
fusion strategy and a mixture-of-codebooks with domain-aware routing to improve
information capacity. (2) Regularization Tinker for Optimization Coin, which
utilizes two additional regularizations to further improve gradient supervision
in our proposed Information Tinker. Notably, as a flexible architecture, MoT
adheres to the scaling laws of GFM, offering a controllable model scale.
Compared to SOTA baselines, experiments on 22 datasets across 6 domains
demonstrate that MoT achieves significant improvements in supervised, few-shot,
and zero-shot scenarios.

TL;DR: GDR框架使用预训练生成模型将有不良内容的数据集转换为更适合训练的净化数据集，解决数据枯竭问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着模型训练数据需求增长超过网络数据索引速度，未来十年将面临数据枯竭，而用户生成内容虽多但包含隐私和不良信息风险

Method: 通过预训练生成模型对每个真实数据样本生成条件合成数据，实现数据集匿名化和净化，同时保持网络规模数据集的多样性

Result: GDR在数据集匿名化方面优于工业级解决方案，能够直接净化高度不安全数据集，合成数据自然匹配网络数据集多样性

Conclusion: GDR的简单性和有效性使其成为扩展前沿模型训练数据总量的强大工具

Abstract: For a fixed parameter size, the capabilities of large models are primarily
determined by the quality and quantity of its training data. Consequently,
training datasets now grow faster than the rate at which new data is indexed on
the web, leading to projected data exhaustion over the next decade. Much more
data exists as user-generated content that is not publicly indexed, but
incorporating such data comes with considerable risks, such as leaking private
information and other undesirable content. We introduce a framework, Generative
Data Refinement (GDR), for using pretrained generative models to transform a
dataset with undesirable content into a refined dataset that is more suitable
for training. Our experiments show that GDR can outperform industry-grade
solutions for dataset anonymization, as well as enable direct detoxification of
highly unsafe datasets. Moreover, we show that by generating synthetic data
that is conditioned on each example in the real dataset, GDR's refined outputs
naturally match the diversity of web scale datasets, and thereby avoid the
often challenging task of generating diverse synthetic data via model
prompting. The simplicity and effectiveness of GDR make it a powerful tool for
scaling up the total stock of training data for frontier models.

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型作为物理事件分类的通用骨干网络具有巨大潜力，因其高性能、可解释性和泛化能力，为实验粒子物理中的多模态推理开辟了新途径

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
remarkable capacity to process and reason over structured and unstructured data
modalities beyond natural language. In this work, we explore the applications
of Vision Language Models (VLMs), specifically a fine-tuned variant of LLaMa
3.2, to the task of identifying neutrino interactions in pixelated detector
data from high-energy physics (HEP) experiments. We benchmark this model
against a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture,
similar to those used in the NOvA and DUNE experiments, which have achieved
high efficiency and purity in classifying electron and muon neutrino events.
Our evaluation considers both the classification performance and
interpretability of the model predictions. We find that VLMs can outperform
CNNs, while also providing greater flexibility in integrating auxiliary textual
or semantic information and offering more interpretable, reasoning-based
predictions. This work highlights the potential of VLMs as a general-purpose
backbone for physics event classification, due to their high performance,
interpretability, and generalizability, which opens new avenues for integrating
multimodal reasoning in experimental neutrino physics.

Conclusion: 该框架为研究社区开发下一代智能体提供了有力工具，将开源完整框架包括代码和数据集

Abstract: Developing autonomous LLM agents capable of making a series of intelligent
decisions to solve complex, real-world tasks is a fast-evolving frontier. Like
human cognitive development, agents are expected to acquire knowledge and
skills through exploration and interaction with the environment. Despite
advances, the community still lacks a unified, interactive reinforcement
learning (RL) framework that can effectively train such agents from scratch --
without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) -- across diverse and realistic
environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentGym-RL, a new framework to
train LLM agents for multi-turn interactive decision-making through RL. The
framework features a modular and decoupled architecture, ensuring high
flexibility and extensibility. It encompasses a wide variety of real-world
scenarios, and supports mainstream RL algorithms. Furthermore, we propose
ScalingInter-RL, a training approach designed for exploration-exploitation
balance and stable RL optimization. In early stages, it emphasizes exploitation
by restricting the number of interactions, and gradually shifts towards
exploration with larger horizons to encourage diverse problem-solving
strategies. In this way, the agent develops more diverse behaviors and is less
prone to collapse under long horizons. We perform extensive experiments to
validate the stability and effectiveness of both the AgentGym-RL framework and
the ScalingInter-RL approach. Our agents match or surpass commercial models on
27 tasks across diverse environments. We offer key insights and will
open-source the complete AgentGym-RL framework -- including code and datasets
-- to empower the research community in developing the next generation of
intelligent agents.

Motivation: 传统神经网络在保险定价中缺乏可解释性，而传统精算方法预测能力有限，需要结合两者的优势

Abstract: This paper introduces the Actuarial Neural Additive Model, an inherently
interpretable deep learning model for general insurance pricing that offers
fully transparent and interpretable results while retaining the strong
predictive power of neural networks. This model assigns a dedicated neural
network (or subnetwork) to each individual covariate and pairwise interaction
term to independently learn its impact on the modeled output while implementing
various architectural constraints to allow for essential interpretability (e.g.
sparsity) and practical requirements (e.g. smoothness, monotonicity) in
insurance applications. The development of our model is grounded in a solid
foundation, where we establish a concrete definition of interpretability within
the insurance context, complemented by a rigorous mathematical framework.
Comparisons in terms of prediction accuracy are made with traditional actuarial
and state-of-the-art machine learning methods using both synthetic and real
insurance datasets. The results show that the proposed model outperforms other
methods in most cases while offering complete transparency in its internal
logic, underscoring the strong interpretability and predictive capability.

Method: 提出SHAining方法，使用流程发现作为下游任务，分析超过22,000个事件日志，量化不同事件日志特征对算法指标的边际贡献

Conclusion: 该方法能够评估算法的鲁棒性，为流程挖掘算法评估提供了更系统化的分析框架，弥补了现有工作的不足

Abstract: Process mining aims to extract and analyze insights from event logs, yet
algorithm metric results vary widely depending on structural event log
characteristics. Existing work often evaluates algorithms on a fixed set of
real-world event logs but lacks a systematic analysis of how event log
characteristics impact algorithms individually. Moreover, since event logs are
generated from processes, where characteristics co-occur, we focus on
associational rather than causal effects to assess how strong the overlapping
individual characteristic affects evaluation metrics without assuming isolated
causal effects, a factor often neglected by prior work. We introduce SHAining,
the first approach to quantify the marginal contribution of varying event log
characteristics to process mining algorithms' metrics. Using process discovery
as a downstream task, we analyze over 22,000 event logs covering a wide span of
characteristics to uncover which affect algorithms across metrics (e.g.,
fitness, precision, complexity) the most. Furthermore, we offer novel insights
about how the value of event log characteristics correlates with their
contributed impact, assessing the algorithm's robustness.

TL;DR: 通过转换多个老师的思维能力到学生模型，Merge-of-Thought Distillation (MoT) 框架在仅使用200个高质量CoT样本的情况下，让Qwen3-14B在数学竞赛测试中超越了更大的模型，并提升了普通推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理精结方法偏向于假设只有一个最佳老师，而实际上存在多个潜在老师和越来越多的CoT语料库。不同学生有不同的"最佳老师"，同一学生在不同数据集上的最佳老师也可能不同。

Method: 提出Merge-of-Thought Distillation (MoT)轻量框架，通过在老师特定的监督微调分支和权重空间合并之间交替进行，将多个老师的推理能力统一到学生模型中。

Result: 在数学竞赛测试中，MoT在仅使用200个高质量CoT样本的情况下，让Qwen3-14B超越了DEEPSEEK-R1、QWEN3-30B-A3B、QWEN3-32B和OPENAI-O1等强大模型。方法较单一老师精结和粵左多老师聚合方法都更优。

Conclusion: MoT作为一种简单、可扩展的方法，能够高效地将多样化老师的长链推理能力精结到紧凑的学生模型中，同时减轻过拟合和坏失忘问题，提升普通推理能力。

Abstract: Efficient reasoning distillation for long chain-of-thought (CoT) models is
increasingly constrained by the assumption of a single oracle teacher, despite
practical availability of multiple candidate teachers and growing CoT corpora.
We revisit teacher selection and observe that different students have different
"best teachers," and even for the same student the best teacher can vary across
datasets. Therefore, to unify multiple teachers' reasoning abilities into
student with overcoming conflicts among various teachers' supervision, we
propose Merge-of-Thought Distillation (MoT), a lightweight framework that
alternates between teacher-specific supervised fine-tuning branches and
weight-space merging of the resulting student variants. On competition math
benchmarks, using only about 200 high-quality CoT samples, applying MoT to a
Qwen3-14B student surpasses strong models including DEEPSEEK-R1, QWEN3-30B-A3B,
QWEN3-32B, and OPENAI-O1, demonstrating substantial gains. Besides, MoT
consistently outperforms the best single-teacher distillation and the naive
multi-teacher union, raises the performance ceiling while mitigating
overfitting, and shows robustness to distribution-shifted and peer-level
teachers. Moreover, MoT reduces catastrophic forgetting, improves general
reasoning beyond mathematics and even cultivates a better teacher, indicating
that consensus-filtered reasoning features transfer broadly. These results
position MoT as a simple, scalable route to efficiently distilling long CoT
capabilities from diverse teachers into compact students.

Motivation: 研究带重球动量的梯度下降算法的数学性质，理解其与普通梯度下降的关系，以及动量参数对算法行为的影响。

Method: 基于Kovachki和Stuart(2021)的工作，在指数吸引不变流形上分析算法，推导修正损失函数，进行组合数学分析，建立任意阶近似边界的连续修正方程。

Result: 证明了HB算法在足够小步长下等价于带修正损失的普通梯度下降，获得了O(h^R)的全局近似边界，发现了包含欧拉和Narayana多项式的丰富多项式族。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了重球动量梯度下降的主要特性，为分析其他优化算法提供了路线图，理论结果适用于全批次和小批次HB算法。

Abstract: We analyze gradient descent with Polyak heavy-ball momentum (HB) whose fixed
momentum parameter $\beta \in (0, 1)$ provides exponential decay of memory.
Building on Kovachki and Stuart (2021), we prove that on an exponentially
attractive invariant manifold the algorithm is exactly plain gradient descent
with a modified loss, provided that the step size $h$ is small enough. Although
the modified loss does not admit a closed-form expression, we describe it with
arbitrary precision and prove global (finite "time" horizon) approximation
bounds $O(h^{R})$ for any finite order $R \geq 2$. We then conduct a
fine-grained analysis of the combinatorics underlying the memoryless
approximations of HB, in particular, finding a rich family of polynomials in
$\beta$ hidden inside which contains Eulerian and Narayana polynomials. We
derive continuous modified equations of arbitrary approximation order (with
rigorous bounds) and the principal flow that approximates the HB dynamics,
generalizing Rosca et al. (2023). Approximation theorems cover both full-batch
and mini-batch HB. Our theoretical results shed new light on the main features
of gradient descent with heavy-ball momentum, and outline a road-map for
similar analysis of other optimization algorithms.

Motivation: 虽然优化器在深度学习训练中至关重要，但如何选择适合的优化器却得不到充分关注，需要深入研究优化器选择的标准和方法。

Method: 使用Kaggle心脏病数据集，在简单的多层感知机模型上对比10种优化器的性能，采用一致的训练范式，评估收敛速度、稳定性以及AUC、精度、召回等分类指标。

Result: 结果显示收敛速度与稳定性存在拼扣：Adagrad和Adadelta更稳定但收敛慢。RMSProp在所有指标上表现最优，达到精度0.765、召回0.827、AUC 0.841，训练时间更快，但稳定性不是最好。

Conclusion: 建议在计算资源不受限制的环境中，通过系统评估来选择优化器，以提高深度学习模型训练的科学性和性能。

Abstract: Optimization has been an important factor and topic of interest in training
deep learning models, yet less attention has been given to how we select the
optimizers we use to train these models. Hence, there is a need to dive deeper
into how we select the optimizers we use for training and the metrics that
determine this selection. In this work, we compare the performance of 10
different optimizers in training a simple Multi-layer Perceptron model using a
heart disease dataset from Kaggle. We set up a consistent training paradigm and
evaluate the optimizers based on metrics such as convergence speed and
stability. We also include some other Machine Learning Evaluation metrics such
as AUC, Precision, and Recall, which are central metrics to classification
problems. Our results show that there are trade-offs between convergence speed
and stability, as optimizers like Adagrad and Adadelta, which are more stable,
took longer time to converge. Across all our metrics, we chose RMSProp to be
the most effective optimizer for this heart disease prediction task because it
offered a balanced performance across key metrics. It achieved a precision of
0.765, a recall of 0.827, and an AUC of 0.841, along with faster training time.
However, it was not the most stable. We recommend that, in less
compute-constrained environments, this method of choosing optimizers through a
thorough evaluation should be adopted to increase the scientific nature and
performance in training deep learning models.

Motivation: 传统生成模型如自编码器和变分自编码器在热设计中面临高计算成本和潜在空间不连续的问题，限制了设计探索和物理一致性解决方案的生成能力。

Method: 使用VRRAE在潜在空间中引入截断SVD，获得连续、可解释的结构化表示；然后利用DeepONet，在分支网络中使用紧凑潜在编码，在主干网络中使用空间坐标，高效预测温度梯度。

Conclusion: 结构化潜在表示对算子学习至关重要，生成模型与算子网络的结合在热设计和更广泛的工程应用中具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Generative thermal design for complex geometries is fundamental in many areas
of engineering, yet it faces two main challenges: the high computational cost
of high-fidelity simulations and the limitations of conventional generative
models. Approaches such as autoencoders (AEs) and variational autoencoders
(VAEs) often produce unstructured latent spaces with discontinuities, which
restricts their capacity to explore designs and generate physically consistent
solutions.
  To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework that combines
Variational Rank-Reduction Autoencoders (VRRAEs) with Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONets). The VRRAE introduces a truncated SVD within the latent space,
leading to continuous, interpretable, and well-structured representations that
mitigate posterior collapse and improve geometric reconstruction. The DeepONet
then exploits this compact latent encoding in its branch network, together with
spatial coordinates in the trunk network, to predict temperature gradients
efficiently and accurately.
  This hybrid approach not only enhances the quality of generated geometries
and the accuracy of gradient prediction, but also provides a substantial
advantage in inference efficiency compared to traditional numerical solvers.
Overall, the study underscores the importance of structured latent
representations for operator learning and highlights the potential of combining
generative models and operator networks in thermal design and broader
engineering applications.

Abstract: In this work, we focus on the efficiency and scalability of pairwise
constraint-based active clustering, crucial for processing large-scale data in
applications such as data mining, knowledge annotation, and AI model
pre-training. Our goals are threefold: (1) to reduce computational costs for
iterative clustering updates; (2) to enhance the impact of user-provided
constraints to minimize annotation requirements for precise clustering; and (3)
to cut down memory usage in practical deployments. To achieve these aims, we
propose a graph-based active clustering algorithm that utilizes two sparse
graphs: one for representing relationships between data (our proposed data
skeleton) and another for updating this data skeleton. These two graphs work in
concert, enabling the refinement of connected subgraphs within the data
skeleton to create nested clusters. Our empirical analysis confirms that the
proposed algorithm consistently facilitates more accurate clustering with
dramatically less input of user-provided constraints, and outperforms its
counterparts in terms of computational performance and scalability, while
maintaining robustness across various distance metrics.

Abstract: Timely and robust influenza incidence forecasting is critical for public
health decision-making. To address this, we present MAESTRO, a Multi-modal
Adaptive Ensemble for Spectro-Temporal Robust Optimization. MAESTRO achieves
robustness by adaptively fusing multi-modal inputs-including surveillance, web
search trends, and meteorological data-and leveraging a comprehensive
spectro-temporal architecture. The model first decomposes time series into
seasonal and trend components. These are then processed through a hybrid
feature enhancement pipeline combining Transformer-based encoders, a Mamba
state-space model for long-range dependencies, multi-scale temporal
convolutions, and a frequency-domain analysis module. A cross-channel attention
mechanism further integrates information across the different data modalities.
Finally, a temporal projection head performs sequence-to-sequence forecasting,
with an optional estimator to quantify prediction uncertainty. Evaluated on
over 11 years of Hong Kong influenza data (excluding the COVID-19 period),
MAESTRO shows strong competitive performance, demonstrating a superior model
fit and relative accuracy, achieving a state-of-the-art R-square of 0.956.
Extensive ablations confirm the significant contributions of both multi-modal
fusion and the spectro-temporal components. Our modular and reproducible
pipeline is made publicly available to facilitate deployment and extension to
other regions and pathogens.Our publicly available pipeline presents a
powerful, unified framework, demonstrating the critical synergy of advanced
spectro-temporal modeling and multi-modal data fusion for robust
epidemiological forecasting.

Motivation: 大型神经模型在高风险场景中部署，需要确保其行为与人类价值观对齐，解释性提供了实现内部透明度的途径

Method: 推荐将机制解释方法（如电路追踪、激活补丁）作为主要对齐手段，这些方法能够提供因果性视角而非仅是相关性解释

Result: 机制解释方法能够更好地检测和理解AI系统内部的失败模式，包括欺骗性或错位推理，这些是行为方法如RLHF或红队测试可能漏查的

Conclusion: 安全可信的AI发展依赖于将解释性作为一等重要目标，确保系统不仅高效而且可审计、透明并与人类意图对齐

Abstract: Large neural models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes settings,
raising concerns about whether their behavior reliably aligns with human
values. Interpretability provides a route to internal transparency by revealing
the computations that drive outputs. We argue that interpretability especially
mechanistic approaches should be treated as a design principle for alignment,
not an auxiliary diagnostic tool. Post-hoc methods such as LIME or SHAP offer
intuitive but correlational explanations, while mechanistic techniques like
circuit tracing or activation patching yield causal insight into internal
failures, including deceptive or misaligned reasoning that behavioral methods
like RLHF, red teaming, or Constitutional AI may overlook. Despite these
advantages, interpretability faces challenges of scalability, epistemic
uncertainty, and mismatches between learned representations and human concepts.
Our position is that progress on safe and trustworthy AI will depend on making
interpretability a first-class objective of AI research and development,
ensuring that systems are not only effective but also auditable, transparent,
and aligned with human intent.

Motivation: 比较深度学习和传统机器学习算法在24小时运动行为（睡眠、久坐、轻强度和中高强度运动）分类任务中的性能差异

Method: 使用151名成年人的手腕加速度计数据，采用10秒非重叠窗口分析、提取104个手工特征。训练4种深度学习算法（LSTM、BiLSTM、GRU、1D-CNN）和6种传统机器学习算法（RF、SVM、XGBoost等）

Result: 使用原始加速度信号的LSTM、BiLSTM、GRU准确度达85%，1D-CNN为80%。使用手工特征时，所有算法准确度70-81%。中高强度运动分类错误较多

Conclusion: 深度学习使用原始加速度信号在运动行为分类中仅略好于传统机器学习方法，性能提升不明显

Abstract: Purpose: We compared the performance of deep learning (DL) and classical
machine learning (ML) algorithms for the classification of 24-hour movement
behavior into sleep, sedentary, light intensity physical activity (LPA), and
moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA). Methods: Open-access
data from 151 adults wearing a wrist-worn accelerometer (Axivity-AX3) was used.
Participants were randomly divided into training, validation, and test sets
(121, 15, and 15 participants each). Raw acceleration signals were segmented
into non-overlapping 10-second windows, and then a total of 104 handcrafted
features were extracted. Four DL algorithms-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM),
Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and
One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN)-were trained using raw
acceleration signals and with handcrafted features extracted from these signals
to predict 24-hour movement behavior categories. The handcrafted features were
also used to train classical ML algorithms, namely Random Forest (RF), Support
Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Logistic Regression
(LR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Decision Tree (DT) for classifying
24-hour movement behavior intensities. Results: LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU showed an
overall accuracy of approximately 85% when trained with raw acceleration
signals, and 1D-CNN an overall accuracy of approximately 80%. When trained on
handcrafted features, the overall accuracy for both DL and classical ML
algorithms ranged from 70% to 81%. Overall, there was a higher confusion in
classification of MVPA and LPA, compared to sleep and sedentary categories.
Conclusion: DL methods with raw acceleration signals had only slightly better
performance in predicting 24-hour movement behavior intensities, compared to
when DL and classical ML were trained with handcrafted features.

*Khawla Elhadri,Jörg Schlötterer,Christin Seifert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: XNNTab是一种可解释的神经网络架构，使用稀疏自编码器学习字典式单语义特征，通过自动化方法赋予特征可解释语义，将预测表示为语义组件的线性组合，在保持高性能的同时实现完全可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格数据在金融和医疗等领域应用广泛，但现有的DNN模型虽然预测性能好，但缺乏可解释性，是黑盒模型。需要开发既能保持高性能又具有完全可解释性的神经网络架构。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器(SAE)在学习到的潜在空间中构建单语义特征字典，通过自动化方法为这些特征赋予人类可解释的语义，使预测结果可以表示为语义有意义组件的线性组合。

Result: 实证评估表明，XNNTab在性能上达到或超过了最先进的黑盒神经网络模型和经典机器学习方法，同时保持了完全的可解释性。

Conclusion: XNNTab成功解决了表格数据建模中性能与可解释性之间的权衡问题，为需要高可解释性的应用领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Tabular data is the foundation of many applications in fields such as finance
and healthcare. Although DNNs tailored for tabular data achieve competitive
predictive performance, they are blackboxes with little interpretability. We
introduce XNNTab, a neural architecture that uses a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to
learn a dictionary of monosemantic features within the latent space used for
prediction. Using an automated method, we assign human-interpretable semantics
to these features. This allows us to represent predictions as linear
combinations of semantically meaningful components. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that XNNTab attains performance on par with or exceeding that of
state-of-the-art, black-box neural models and classical machine learning
approaches while being fully interpretable.

### [166] [An upper bound of the silhouette validation metric for clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08625)
*Hugo Sträng,Tai Dinh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对轮廓系数的新上界计算方法，通过为每个数据点推导出尖锐的上界，并聚合得到数据集相关的ASW上界，该上界通常远低于1，可用于评估聚类质量接近最优解的程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轮廓系数的标准上界1在实际数据集中往往无法达到，且数据集特定的最大ASW值通常未知，这限制了轮廓系数作为聚类质量评估指标的有效性。

Method: 为给定数据集中的每个数据点推导出其轮廓宽度的尖锐上界，然后通过聚合这些个体上界得到ASW的规范数据依赖上界。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，所提出的上界在许多情况下被证明是近乎紧致的，显著丰富了聚类质量评估的能力。

Conclusion: 该方法能够指示单个数据点是否能够被良好放置，支持基于轮廓的优化循环的早期停止，并帮助回答聚类结果在特定数据上接近最佳可能结果的程度。

Abstract: The silhouette coefficient summarizes, per observation, cohesion versus
separation in [-1, 1]; the average silhouette width (ASW) is a common internal
measure of clustering quality where higher values indicate more coveted
results. However, the dataset-specific maximum of ASW is typically unknown, and
the standard upper limit 1 is often unattainable. In this work, we derive for
each data point in a given dataset a sharp upper bound on its silhouette width.
By aggregating these individual bounds, we present a canonical data-dependent
upper bound on ASW that often assumes values well below 1. The presented bounds
can indicate whether individual data points can ever be well placed, enable
early stopping of silhouette-based optimization loops, and help answer a key
question: How close is my clustering result to the best possible outcome on
this specific data? Across synthetic and real datasets, the bounds are provably
near-tight in many cases and offer significant enrichment of cluster quality
evaluation.

Conclusion: 这项工作在可复制强化学习方面取得了重要进展，为线性函数逼近设置提供了首个可证明高效的可复制算法，对提高RL算法的稳定性和一致性具有重要意义。

Abstract: Replication of experimental results has been a challenge faced by many
scientific disciplines, including the field of machine learning. Recent work on
the theory of machine learning has formalized replicability as the demand that
an algorithm produce identical outcomes when executed twice on different
samples from the same distribution. Provably replicable algorithms are
especially interesting for reinforcement learning (RL), where algorithms are
known to be unstable in practice. While replicable algorithms exist for tabular
RL settings, extending these guarantees to more practical function
approximation settings has remained an open problem. In this work, we make
progress by developing replicable methods for linear function approximation in
RL. We first introduce two efficient algorithms for replicable random design
regression and uncentered covariance estimation, each of independent interest.
We then leverage these tools to provide the first provably efficient replicable
RL algorithms for linear Markov decision processes in both the generative model
and episodic settings. Finally, we evaluate our algorithms experimentally and
show how they can inspire more consistent neural policies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种诊断信号保真指数(SFI)来量化电子健康记录中的诊断数据质量，并通过SFI意识的检验调整提高机器学习模型在不同医疗系统间的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在不同医疗系统间的性能泄漏是个重要问题，诊断信号衰减是一个基础但很少被探讨的因素。需要一种方法来量化诊断数据质量并提高模型的可移植性。

Method: 建立了一个模拟框架生成2,500个合成数据集，每个包含1,000名患者。SFI指数由六个可解释的组件构成：诊断特异性、时间一致性、熵、上下文一致性、药物对齐和趋势稳定性。通过乘性调整进行SFI意识的检验调整。

Result: 在最优参数(α=2.0)下，SFI意识的检验调整显著提高了所有指标(p<0.001)。收益范围从平衡准确率的10.3%到召回率的32.5%，精确度和F1分数分别提高31.9%和26.1%。

Conclusion: 诊断信号衰减是模型普适性的可处理障碍。SFI意识的检验调整提供了一种实用的、无标签的策略，可以在医疗健康上下文中提高预测性能，尤其是对于缺乏结果标签的大规模管理数据集。

Abstract: \textbf{Background:} Machine learning models trained on electronic health
records (EHRs) often degrade across healthcare systems due to distributional
shift. A fundamental but underexplored factor is diagnostic signal decay:
variability in diagnostic quality and consistency across institutions, which
affects the reliability of codes used for training and prediction.
  \textbf{Objective:} To develop a Signal Fidelity Index (SFI) quantifying
diagnostic data quality at the patient level in dementia, and to test SFI-aware
calibration for improving model performance across heterogeneous datasets
without outcome labels.
  \textbf{Methods:} We built a simulation framework generating 2,500 synthetic
datasets, each with 1,000 patients and realistic demographics, encounters, and
coding patterns based on dementia risk factors. The SFI was derived from six
interpretable components: diagnostic specificity, temporal consistency,
entropy, contextual concordance, medication alignment, and trajectory
stability. SFI-aware calibration applied a multiplicative adjustment, optimized
across 50 simulation batches.
  \textbf{Results:} At the optimal parameter ($\alpha$ = 2.0), SFI-aware
calibration significantly improved all metrics (p $<$ 0.001). Gains ranged from
10.3\% for Balanced Accuracy to 32.5\% for Recall, with notable increases in
Precision (31.9\%) and F1-score (26.1\%). Performance approached reference
standards, with F1-score and Recall within 1\% and Balanced Accuracy and
Detection Rate improved by 52.3\% and 41.1\%, respectively.
  \textbf{Conclusions:} Diagnostic signal decay is a tractable barrier to model
generalization. SFI-aware calibration provides a practical, label-free strategy
to enhance prediction across healthcare contexts, particularly for large-scale
administrative datasets lacking outcome labels.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于托秘的安全聚合方法，解决了联邦学习中无法在实数域实现完美隐私的问题，同时避免了有限域方法的精度损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中，通过安全多方计算进行安全聚合可以保护敏感数据隐私。但在实数域上无法实现完美隐私，而有限域方法又会导致精度损失。

Method: 提出使用托秘（torus）替代有限域进行安全参数聚合。利用托秘上的均匀分布来保证完美隐私，同时避免固定点模算术带来的精度问题。

Result: 实验结果显示，新协议在保持完美隐私的同时，性能与无安全聚合模型相似。与有限域安全聚合相比，基于托秘的协议在模型精度和余弦相似度方面显著更优。

Conclusion: 基于托秘的安全聚合协议是一种更安全的选择，它能够在保证完美隐私的前提下，避免精度损失，从而提高了联邦学习的实际效果。

Abstract: In federated learning, multiple parties train models locally and share their
parameters with a central server, which aggregates them to update a global
model. To address the risk of exposing sensitive data through local models,
secure aggregation via secure multiparty computation has been proposed to
enhance privacy. At the same time, perfect privacy can only be achieved by a
uniform distribution of the masked local models to be aggregated. This raises a
problem when working with real valued data, as there is no measure on the reals
that is invariant under the masking operation, and hence information leakage is
bound to occur. Shifting the data to a finite field circumvents this problem,
but as a downside runs into an inherent accuracy complexity tradeoff issue due
to fixed point modular arithmetic as opposed to floating point numbers that can
simultaneously handle numbers of varying magnitudes. In this paper, a novel
secure parameter aggregation method is proposed that employs the torus rather
than a finite field. This approach guarantees perfect privacy for each party's
data by utilizing the uniform distribution on the torus, while avoiding
accuracy losses. Experimental results show that the new protocol performs
similarly to the model without secure aggregation while maintaining perfect
privacy. Compared to the finite field secure aggregation, the torus-based
protocol can in some cases significantly outperform it in terms of model
accuracy and cosine similarity, hence making it a safer choice.

Motivation: 反向传播算法存在生物学上不合理的反向锁定和全局误差传播等限制，前向-前向算法虽然更符合生物学原理但在准确率和推理效率方面表现不佳

Method: 将前向-前向算法与基于相似性的元组损失框架相整合，提出FAUST算法，避免了推理时需要进行多次前向传递的问题

Result: 在MNIST、Fashion-MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上的实验表明，FAUST显著提高了准确率。在CIFAR-10上使用简单MLP架构达到56.22%的准确率，接近反向传播的57.63%基准

Conclusion: FAUST算法成功解决了前向-前向算法在准确率和推理效率方面的局限性，使其更接近反向传播的性能，同时保持了生物学合理性

Abstract: Backpropagation is the pivotal algorithm underpinning the success of
artificial neural networks, yet it has critical limitations such as
biologically implausible backward locking and global error propagation. To
circumvent these constraints, the Forward-Forward algorithm was proposed as a
more biologically plausible method that replaces the backward pass with an
additional forward pass. Despite this advantage, the Forward-Forward algorithm
significantly trails backpropagation in accuracy, and its optimal form exhibits
low inference efficiency due to multiple forward passes required. In this work,
the Forward-Forward algorithm is reshaped through its integration with
similarity learning frameworks, eliminating the need for multiple forward
passes during inference. This proposed algorithm is named Forward-Forward
Algorithm Unified with Similarity-based Tuplet loss (FAUST). Empirical
evaluations on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets indicate that FAUST
substantially improves accuracy, narrowing the gap with backpropagation. On
CIFAR-10, FAUST achieves 56.22\% accuracy with a simple multi-layer perceptron
architecture, approaching the backpropagation benchmark of 57.63\% accuracy.

Abstract: In the evolving IT landscape, stability and reliability of systems are
essential, yet their growing complexity challenges DevOps teams in
implementation and maintenance. Log analysis, a core element of AIOps, provides
critical insights into complex behaviors and failures. This dissertation
introduces a three-layered architecture to support DevOps in failure
resolution. The first layer, Log Investigation, performs autonomous log
labeling and anomaly classification. We propose a method that labels log data
without manual effort, enabling supervised training and precise evaluation of
anomaly detection. Additionally, we define a taxonomy that groups anomalies
into three categories, ensuring appropriate method selection. The second layer,
Anomaly Detection, detects behaviors deviating from the norm. We propose a
flexible Anomaly Detection method adaptable to unsupervised, weakly supervised,
and supervised training. Evaluations on public and industry datasets show
F1-scores between 0.98 and 1.0, ensuring reliable anomaly detection. The third
layer, Root Cause Analysis, identifies minimal log sets describing failures,
their origin, and event sequences. By balancing training data and identifying
key services, our Root Cause Analysis method consistently detects 90-98% of
root cause log lines within the top 10 candidates, providing actionable
insights for mitigation. Our research addresses how log analysis methods can be
designed and optimized to help DevOps resolve failures efficiently. By
integrating these three layers, the architecture equips teams with robust
methods to enhance IT system reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的电刺激映像(ESM)虽然是临床金标准，但具有侵入性和耗时的缺点，需要开发更高效、无侵入的方法来识别语言关键脑区域。

Method: 分析16名参与者的脑内电脑图(ECoG)数据，统合神经活动信号、解剖区域标签和功能连接性特征，使用支持向量机(SVM)和多层感知器(MLP)进行分类模型训练。

Result: 最佳模型在持有测试集上达到了高准确性(ROC-AUC: 0.87, PR-AUC: 0.57)，组合区域和连接性特征的模型表现最佳。

Conclusion: 统合空间信息和网络动态特征，结合非线性模型能够显著提升脑外科预期评估中的功能映像效果。

Abstract: Identifying cortical regions critical for speech is essential for safe brain
surgery in or near language areas. While Electrical Stimulation Mapping (ESM)
remains the clinical gold standard, it is invasive and time-consuming. To
address this, we analyzed intracranial electrocorticographic (ECoG) data from
16 participants performing speech tasks and developed machine learning models
to directly predict if the brain region underneath each ECoG electrode is
critical. Ground truth labels indicating speech arrest were derived
independently from Electrical Stimulation Mapping (ESM) and used to train
classification models. Our framework integrates neural activity signals,
anatomical region labels, and functional connectivity features to capture both
local activity and network-level dynamics. We found that models combining
region and connectivity features matched the performance of the full feature
set, and outperformed models using either type alone. To classify each
electrode, trial-level predictions were aggregated using an MLP applied to
histogram-encoded scores. Our best-performing model, a trial-level RBF-kernel
Support Vector Machine together with MLP-based aggregation, achieved strong
accuracy on held-out participants (ROC-AUC: 0.87, PR-AUC: 0.57). These findings
highlight the value of combining spatial and network information with
non-linear modeling to improve functional mapping in presurgical evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于临时TEE模块的服务器扩展方案，实现恶意安全环境下的差分隐私联邦学习，通过可验证证明和客户端审计机制，在保持系统可扩展性的同时减少可信计算基的大小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DP-FTRL方法假设半诚实服务器，无法应对客户端退出或被腐蚀的实际情况。虽然TEE看似是解决方案，但直接实现会引入分叉攻击或可用性问题。

Method: 在服务器端部署临时TEE模块作为可信计算基，生成服务器操作的可验证证明。部分被选中的客户端参与审计这些证明，通信和计算开销很小。

Result: 形式化证明显示在恶意设置下仍能保持隐私保证。实验表明在多个实际场景中，该框架仅给客户端带来很小的常数级开销。

Conclusion: 该方案成功解决了DP-FTRL在恶意安全环境下的实现问题，通过创新的TEE使用方式和客户端审计机制，在保证隐私安全的同时维持了系统的实用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: In cross-device private federated learning, differentially private
follow-the-regularized-leader (DP-FTRL) has emerged as a promising
privacy-preserving method. However, existing approaches assume a semi-honest
server and have not addressed the challenge of securely removing this
assumption. This is due to its statefulness, which becomes particularly
problematic in practical settings where clients can drop out or be corrupted.
While trusted execution environments (TEEs) might seem like an obvious
solution, a straightforward implementation can introduce forking attacks or
availability issues due to state management. To address this problem, our paper
introduces a novel server extension that acts as a trusted computing base (TCB)
to realize maliciously secure DP-FTRL. The TCB is implemented with an ephemeral
TEE module on the server side to produce verifiable proofs of server actions.
Some clients, upon being selected, participate in auditing these proofs with
small additional communication and computational demands. This extension
solution reduces the size of the TCB while maintaining the system's scalability
and liveness. We provide formal proofs based on interactive differential
privacy, demonstrating privacy guarantee in malicious settings. Finally, we
experimentally show that our framework adds small constant overhead to clients
in several realistic settings.

Conclusion: 混合剪枝框架是一种有效的模型压缩方法，适合在边缘设处上部署大规模CNN模型。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved significant breakthroughs
in various fields. However, these advancements have led to a substantial
increase in the complexity and size of these networks. This poses a challenge
when deploying large and complex networks on edge devices. Consequently, model
compression has emerged as a research field aimed at reducing the size and
complexity of CNNs. One prominent technique in model compression is model
pruning. This paper will present a new technique of pruning that combines both
channel and layer pruning in what is called a "hybrid pruning framework".
Inspired by EfficientNet, a renowned CNN architecture known for scaling up
networks from both channel and layer perspectives, this hybrid approach applies
the same principles but in reverse, where it scales down the network through
pruning. Experiments on the hybrid approach demonstrated a notable decrease in
the overall complexity of the model, with only a minimal reduction in accuracy
compared to the baseline model. This complexity reduction translates into
reduced latency when deploying the pruned models on an NVIDIA JETSON TX2
embedded AI device.

Motivation: 传统RL后训练需要大量并行化来扩展推理，这带来了延迟、内存、可靠性等技术挑战以及不断增长的经济成本。需要一种去中心化的解决方案来克服这些瓶颈。

Method: SAPO算法在异构计算节点网络中运行，每个节点管理自己的策略模型，同时与其他节点"共享"rollouts。不需要对延迟、模型同质性或硬件做明确假设，节点可以独立运行。

Result: 在受控实验中，SAPO实现了高达94%的累积奖励增益。在由Gensyn社区成员贡献的数千个节点网络上进行的测试也验证了算法的有效性。

Conclusion: SAPO提供了一种有效的去中心化RL后训练方法，能够避免传统扩展瓶颈，同时允许新的可能性，通过跨网络共享rollouts来促进学习过程的引导。

Abstract: Post-training language models (LMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) can
enhance their complex reasoning capabilities without supervised fine-tuning, as
demonstrated by DeepSeek-R1-Zero. However, effectively utilizing RL for LMs
requires significant parallelization to scale-up inference, which introduces
non-trivial technical challenges (e.g. latency, memory, and reliability)
alongside ever-growing financial costs. We present Swarm sAmpling Policy
Optimization (SAPO), a fully decentralized and asynchronous RL post-training
algorithm. SAPO is designed for decentralized networks of heterogenous compute
nodes, where each node manages its own policy model(s) while "sharing" rollouts
with others in the network; no explicit assumptions about latency, model
homogeneity, or hardware are required and nodes can operate in silo if desired.
As a result, the algorithm avoids common bottlenecks in scaling RL
post-training while also allowing (and even encouraging) new possibilities. By
sampling rollouts "shared" across the network, it enables "Aha moments" to
propagate, thereby bootstrapping the learning process. In this paper we show
SAPO achieved cumulative reward gains of up to 94% in controlled experiments.
We also share insights from tests on a network with thousands of nodes
contributed by Gensyn community members running the algorithm on diverse
hardware and models during an open-source demo.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach to generating sample paths of unknown
stochastic differential equations (SDEs) using diffusion models, a class of
generative AI models commonly employed in image and video applications. Unlike
the traditional Monte Carlo methods for simulating SDEs, which require explicit
specifications of the drift and diffusion coefficients, our method takes a
model-free, data-driven approach. Given a finite set of sample paths from an
SDE, we utilize conditional diffusion models to generate new, synthetic paths
of the same SDE. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct a
simulation experiment to compare our method with alternative benchmark ones
including neural SDEs. Furthermore, in an empirical study we leverage these
synthetically generated sample paths to enhance the performance of
reinforcement learning algorithms for continuous-time mean-variance portfolio
selection, hinting promising applications of diffusion models in financial
analysis and decision-making.

Abstract: Machine learning force fields show great promise in enabling more accurate
molecular dynamics simulations compared to manually derived ones. Much of the
progress in recent years was driven by exploiting prior knowledge about
physical systems, in particular symmetries under rotation, translation, and
reflections. In this paper, we argue that there is another important piece of
prior information that, thus fa,r hasn't been explored: Simulating a molecular
system is necessarily continuous, and successive states are therefore extremely
similar. Our contribution is to show that we can exploit this information by
recasting a state-of-the-art equivariant base model as a deep equilibrium
model. This allows us to recycle intermediate neural network features from
previous time steps, enabling us to improve both accuracy and speed by
$10\%-20\%$ on the MD17, MD22, and OC20 200k datasets, compared to the non-DEQ
base model. The training is also much more memory efficient, allowing us to
train more expressive models on larger systems.

Abstract: The efficiency of Bayesian optimization (BO) in chemistry is often hindered
by sparse experimental data and complex reaction mechanisms. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce ChemBOMAS, a new framework named LLM-Enhanced
Multi-Agent System for accelerating BO in chemistry. ChemBOMAS's optimization
process is enhanced by LLMs and synergistically employs two strategies:
knowledge-driven coarse-grained optimization and data-driven fine-grained
optimization. First, in the knowledge-driven coarse-grained optimization stage,
LLMs intelligently decompose the vast search space by reasoning over existing
chemical knowledge to identify promising candidate regions. Subsequently, in
the data-driven fine-grained optimization stage, LLMs enhance the BO process
within these candidate regions by generating pseudo-data points, thereby
improving data utilization efficiency and accelerating convergence. Benchmark
evaluations** further confirm that ChemBOMAS significantly enhances
optimization effectiveness and efficiency compared to various BO algorithms.
Importantly, the practical utility of ChemBOMAS was validated through wet-lab
experiments conducted under pharmaceutical industry protocols, targeting
conditional optimization for a previously unreported and challenging chemical
reaction. In the wet experiment, ChemBOMAS achieved an optimal objective value
of 96%. This was substantially higher than the 15% achieved by domain experts.
This real-world success, together with strong performance on benchmark
evaluations, highlights ChemBOMAS as a powerful tool to accelerate chemical
discovery.

Abstract: Federating heterogeneous models on edge devices with diverse resource
constraints has been a notable trend in recent years. Compared to traditional
federated learning (FL) that assumes an identical model architecture to
cooperate, model-heterogeneous FL is more practical and flexible since the
model can be customized to satisfy the deployment requirement. Unfortunately,
no prior work ever dives into the existing model-heterogeneous FL algorithms
under the practical edge device constraints and provides quantitative analysis
on various data scenarios and metrics, which motivates us to rethink and
re-evaluate this paradigm. In our work, we construct the first system platform
\textbf{PracMHBench} to evaluate model-heterogeneous FL on practical
constraints of edge devices, where diverse model heterogeneity algorithms are
classified and tested on multiple data tasks and metrics. Based on the
platform, we perform extensive experiments on these algorithms under the
different edge constraints to observe their applicability and the corresponding
heterogeneity pattern.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于深度强化学习的AI决策支持系统，用于优化大规模伤亡事件中的患者转运分配决策，通过人机协作显著提升决策质量和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模伤亡事件(MCI)会压垮医疗系统，需要在极端压力下快速准确地进行患者-医院分配决策，传统方法难以应对这种复杂场景。

Method: 开发了基于深度强化学习的AI代理，整合患者危急程度、专科护理需求、医院容量和运输物流等因素；构建了MasTER网络指挥仪表板；通过30名参与者（6名专家和24名非专家）的用户研究，比较了三种交互方式（纯人工、人机协作、纯AI）在20和60名患者场景下的表现。

Result: AI参与度增加显著改善决策质量和一致性；AI代理表现优于创伤外科医生(p < 0.001)；AI辅助下非专家能达到专家水平，而未辅助时表现显著较差(p < 0.001)。

Conclusion: AI驱动的决策支持系统有潜力增强大规模伤亡事件的准备培训和实际应急响应管理能力。

Abstract: Mass casualty incidents (MCIs) overwhelm healthcare systems and demand rapid,
accurate patient-hospital allocation decisions under extreme pressure. Here, we
developed and validated a deep reinforcement learning-based decision-support AI
agent to optimize patient transfer decisions during simulated MCIs by balancing
patient acuity levels, specialized care requirements, hospital capacities, and
transport logistics. To integrate this AI agent, we developed MasTER, a
web-accessible command dashboard for MCI management simulations. Through a
controlled user study with 30 participants (6 trauma experts and 24
non-experts), we evaluated three interaction approaches with the AI agent
(human-only, human-AI collaboration, and AI-only) across 20- and 60-patient MCI
scenarios in the Greater Toronto Area. Results demonstrate that increasing AI
involvement significantly improves decision quality and consistency. The AI
agent outperforms trauma surgeons (p < 0.001) and enables non-experts to
achieve expert-level performance when assisted, contrasting sharply with their
significantly inferior unassisted performance (p < 0.001). These findings
establish the potential for our AI-driven decision support to enhance both MCI
preparedness training and real-world emergency response management.

Conclusion: FLM是首个能够使用标准MLP架构表示完整可分离多维傅里叶基的神经网络，为科学计算问题提供了有效的谱基表示方法

Abstract: We introduce the Fourier Learning Machine (FLM), a neural network (NN)
architecture designed to represent a multidimensional nonharmonic Fourier
series. The FLM uses a simple feedforward structure with cosine activation
functions to learn the frequencies, amplitudes, and phase shifts of the series
as trainable parameters. This design allows the model to create a
problem-specific spectral basis adaptable to both periodic and nonperiodic
functions. Unlike previous Fourier-inspired NN models, the FLM is the first
architecture able to represent a complete, separable Fourier basis in multiple
dimensions using a standard Multilayer Perceptron-like architecture. A
one-to-one correspondence between the Fourier coefficients and amplitudes and
phase-shifts is demonstrated, allowing for the translation between a full,
separable basis form and the cosine phase--shifted one. Additionally, we
evaluate the performance of FLMs on several scientific computing problems,
including benchmark Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and a family of
Optimal Control Problems (OCPs). Computational experiments show that the
performance of FLMs is comparable, and often superior, to that of established
architectures like SIREN and vanilla feedforward NNs.

Abstract: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common brain disorder in
children that can persist into adulthood, affecting social, academic, and
career life. Early diagnosis is crucial for managing these impacts on patients
and the healthcare system but is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. This
paper presents a novel method to improve ADHD diagnosis precision and
timeliness by leveraging Deep Learning (DL) approaches and electroencephalogram
(EEG) signals. We introduce ADHDeepNet, a DL model that utilizes comprehensive
temporal-spatial characterization, attention modules, and explainability
techniques optimized for EEG signals. ADHDeepNet integrates feature extraction
and refinement processes to enhance ADHD diagnosis. The model was trained and
validated on a dataset of 121 participants (61 ADHD, 60 Healthy Controls),
employing nested cross-validation for robust performance. The proposed
two-stage methodology uses a 10-fold cross-subject validation strategy.
Initially, each iteration optimizes the model's hyper-parameters with inner
2-fold cross-validation. Then, Additive Gaussian Noise (AGN) with various
standard deviations and magnification levels is applied for data augmentation.
ADHDeepNet achieved 100% sensitivity and 99.17% accuracy in classifying ADHD/HC
subjects. To clarify model explainability and identify key brain regions and
frequency bands for ADHD diagnosis, we analyzed the learned weights and
activation patterns of the model's primary layers. Additionally, t-distributed
Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) visualized high-dimensional data, aiding
in interpreting the model's decisions. This study highlights the potential of
DL and EEG in enhancing ADHD diagnosis accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Honey bee colonies are essential for global food security and ecosystem
stability, yet they face escalating threats from pests, diseases, and
environmental stressors. Traditional hive inspections are labor-intensive and
disruptive, while cloud-based monitoring solutions remain impractical for
remote or resource-limited apiaries. Recent advances in Internet of Things
(IoT) and Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) enable low-power, real-time monitoring
directly on edge devices, offering scalable and non-invasive alternatives. This
survey synthesizes current innovations at the intersection of TinyML and
apiculture, organized around four key functional areas: monitoring hive
conditions, recognizing bee behaviors, detecting pests and diseases, and
forecasting swarming events. We further examine supporting resources, including
publicly available datasets, lightweight model architectures optimized for
embedded deployment, and benchmarking strategies tailored to field constraints.
Critical limitations such as data scarcity, generalization challenges, and
deployment barriers in off-grid environments are highlighted, alongside
emerging opportunities in ultra-efficient inference pipelines, adaptive edge
learning, and dataset standardization. By consolidating research and
engineering practices, this work provides a foundation for scalable, AI-driven,
and ecologically informed monitoring systems to support sustainable pollinator
management.
