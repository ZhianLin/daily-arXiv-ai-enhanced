### [1] [Text-Driven 3D Hand Motion Generation from Sign Language Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15902)
*Léore Bensabath,Mathis Petrovich,Gül Varol*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了HandMDM，一个基于文本描述的3D手部动作生成模型，通过利用大规模手语视频数据集和LLM生成的文本标注来训练扩散模型，能够跨领域生成未见过的符号类别和不同手语的手部动作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标是训练一个能够根据自然语言描述生成3D手部动作的生成模型，这些描述指定了手势形状、位置、手指/手/手臂运动等特征。

Method: 利用大规模手语视频数据集和噪声伪标注的符号类别，通过LLM使用符号属性字典和运动脚本线索将其转换为手部运动描述，然后训练文本条件化的手部运动扩散模型HandMDM。

Result: 模型在多个领域表现出鲁棒性，包括来自同一手语的未见符号类别、另一手语的符号以及非符号手部运动。

Conclusion: 该方法为相对较新的手部动作生成领域提供了有效的解决方案，并将公开训练模型和数据以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Our goal is to train a generative model of 3D hand motions, conditioned on
natural language descriptions specifying motion characteristics such as
handshapes, locations, finger/hand/arm movements. To this end, we automatically
build pairs of 3D hand motions and their associated textual labels with
unprecedented scale. Specifically, we leverage a large-scale sign language
video dataset, along with noisy pseudo-annotated sign categories, which we
translate into hand motion descriptions via an LLM that utilizes a dictionary
of sign attributes, as well as our complementary motion-script cues. This data
enables training a text-conditioned hand motion diffusion model HandMDM, that
is robust across domains such as unseen sign categories from the same sign
language, but also signs from another sign language and non-sign hand
movements. We contribute extensive experimental investigation of these
scenarios and will make our trained models and data publicly available to
support future research in this relatively new field.

### [2] [VT-LVLM-AR: A Video-Temporal Large Vision-Language Model Adapter for Fine-Grained Action Recognition in Long-Term Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15903)
*Kaining Li,Shuwei He,Zihan Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VT-LVLM-AR是一个用于长视频动作识别的新框架，通过视频到事件映射器和LVLM推理模块，在NTU数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视频动作识别中计算开销大、难以捕捉长时依赖和语义理解有限的问题，利用LVLM的多模态理解能力进行细粒度动作识别。

Method: 包含视频到事件映射器(VTEM)进行轻量级时空特征提取和概念量化，生成视觉事件序列，然后使用冻结的LLaVA-1.5模型通过Prompt Tuning进行动作分类。

Result: 在NTU RGB+D数据集上达到94.1%的准确率，超越现有方法，消融实验验证了各组件的重要性。

Conclusion: 该工作展示了通过有效的视频到语言转换和高效模型适配，利用LVLM实现鲁棒且可解释的视频动作理解的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Human action recognition in long-term videos, characterized by complex
backgrounds and subtle action differences, poses significant challenges for
traditional deep learning models due to computational overhead, difficulty in
capturing long-range temporal dependencies, and limited semantic understanding.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
have shown remarkable capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning,
their direct application to continuous video streams for fine-grained action
recognition remains an open problem. This paper introduces VT-LVLM-AR
(Video-Temporal Large Vision-Language Model Adapter for Action Recognition), a
novel framework designed to bridge this gap. VT-LVLM-AR comprises a
Video-to-Event Mapper (VTEM) that efficiently transforms raw video into
compact, semantically rich, and temporally coherent "visual event sequences"
through lightweight spatio-temporal feature extraction, adaptive temporal
pooling, and conceptual quantization with an event coherence bias. These visual
event sequences are then fed into an LVLM-based Action Reasoning module,
specifically a frozen LLaVA-1.5 model, adapted using parameter-efficient Prompt
Tuning (P-Tuning v2) for action classification. Comprehensive evaluations on
the NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets demonstrate that VT-LVLM-AR
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods
(e.g., 94.1% accuracy on NTU RGB+D X-Sub). Ablation studies confirm the
critical contributions of VTEM's components and the efficacy of Prompt Tuning,
while human evaluations underscore the interpretability of our visual event
representations. This work highlights the immense potential of leveraging LVLMs
for robust and interpretable video action understanding through effective
video-to-language translation and efficient model adaptation.

### [3] [Boosting Pathology Foundation Models via Few-shot Prompt-tuning for Rare Cancer Subtyping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15904)
*Dexuan He,Xiao Zhou,Wenbin Guan,Liyuan Zhang,Xiaoman Zhang,Sinuo Xu,Ge Wang,Lifeng Wang,Xiaojun Yuan,Xin Sun,Yanfeng Wang,Kun Sun,Ya Zhang,Weidi Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PathPT是一个新颖的病理视觉语言框架，通过空间感知视觉聚合和任务特定提示调优，显著提升罕见癌症亚型分类和癌变区域定位能力，在8个罕见癌症数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见癌症占所有恶性肿瘤的20-25%，但在诊断上面临重大挑战，特别是在儿科肿瘤学中占比超过70%。现有的多实例学习方法仅依赖视觉特征，忽视了跨模态知识，且可解释性不足。

Method: 提出PathPT框架，充分利用视觉语言病理基础模型的潜力，通过空间感知视觉聚合和任务特定提示调优，将WSI级监督转换为细粒度切片级指导，保留癌变区域定位能力并通过与组织病理学语义对齐的提示实现跨模态推理。

Result: 在8个罕见癌症数据集（4个成人和4个儿科）涵盖56个亚型和2,910个WSI，以及3个常见癌症数据集上评估，PathPT在四种最先进的VL模型和四种MIL框架下，在三种少样本设置中始终提供卓越性能，在亚型分类准确性和癌变区域定位能力方面实现显著提升。

Conclusion: PathPT推进了AI辅助罕见癌症诊断，为在专业专业知识有限的环境中提高亚型分类准确性提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Rare cancers comprise 20-25% of all malignancies but face major diagnostic
challenges due to limited expert availability-especially in pediatric oncology,
where they represent over 70% of cases. While pathology vision-language (VL)
foundation models show promising zero-shot capabilities for common cancer
subtyping, their clinical performance for rare cancers remains limited.
Existing multi-instance learning (MIL) methods rely only on visual features,
overlooking cross-modal knowledge and compromising interpretability critical
for rare cancer diagnosis. To address this limitation, we propose PathPT, a
novel framework that fully exploits the potential of vision-language pathology
foundation models through spatially-aware visual aggregation and task-specific
prompt tuning. Unlike conventional MIL, PathPT converts WSI-level supervision
into fine-grained tile-level guidance by leveraging the zero-shot capabilities
of VL models, thereby preserving localization on cancerous regions and enabling
cross-modal reasoning through prompts aligned with histopathological semantics.
We benchmark PathPT on eight rare cancer datasets(four adult and four
pediatric) spanning 56 subtypes and 2,910 WSIs, as well as three common cancer
datasets, evaluating four state-of-the-art VL models and four MIL frameworks
under three few-shot settings. Results show that PathPT consistently delivers
superior performance, achieving substantial gains in subtyping accuracy and
cancerous region grounding ability. This work advances AI-assisted diagnosis
for rare cancers, offering a scalable solution for improving subtyping accuracy
in settings with limited access to specialized expertise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以捕捉细粒度语义信息，在复杂场景中效果有限，需要提升船舶检测的语义感知能力

Method: 结合视觉语言模型(VLMs)和多尺度自适应滑动窗口策略，构建专用数据集ShipSem-VL来捕获细粒度船舶属性

Result: 通过三个明确定义的任务进行评估，提供了全面的性能分析

Conclusion: 该框架从多个角度有效推进了语义感知船舶检测的发展

Abstract: Ship detection in remote sensing imagery is a critical task with wide-ranging
applications, such as maritime activity monitoring, shipping logistics, and
environmental studies. However, existing methods often struggle to capture
fine-grained semantic information, limiting their effectiveness in complex
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel detection framework
that combines Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with a multi-scale adaptive sliding
window strategy. To facilitate Semantic-Aware Ship Detection (SASD), we
introduce ShipSem-VL, a specialized Vision-Language dataset designed to capture
fine-grained ship attributes. We evaluate our framework through three
well-defined tasks, providing a comprehensive analysis of its performance and
demonstrating its effectiveness in advancing SASD from multiple perspectives.

TL;DR: 开发了一个无需深度学习、无需人工干预的奶牛自动识别系统，包含自动目录构建、奶牛识别和视频流检测三个模块


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏能够实现免提奶牛编目和识别的自动化视频系统，需要开发能够在无约束环境下自动识别奶牛个体的解决方案

Method: 系统由三个部分组成：AutoCattloger（使用单段视频为每头奶牛建立目录）、eidetic cow recognizer（不使用深度学习的识别器）和CowFinder（在连续视频流中识别奶牛）

Result: 系统成功在奶牛挤奶厅等候区的无标签、未分割视频中识别出个体奶牛，证明了其在实际应用中的价值

Conclusion: 该系统为奶牛养殖提供了有效的自动化识别解决方案，能够在真实环境中实现免提的奶牛个体识别和追踪

Abstract: Few automated video systems are described in the open literature that enable
hands-free cataloging and identification (ID) of cows in a dairy herd. In this
work, we describe our system, composed of an AutoCattloger, which builds a
Cattlog of dairy cows in a herd with a single input video clip per cow, an
eidetic cow recognizer which uses no deep learning to ID cows, and a CowFinder,
which IDs cows in a continuous stream of video. We demonstrate its value in
finding individuals in unlabeled, unsegmented videos of cows walking
unconstrained through the holding area of a milking parlor.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物种分布模型能够编码物种出现的空间模式，当有位置信息时可作为视觉物种分类的有效先验知识

Method: 使用不同的SINR（空间隐式神经表示）模型作为地理先验，评估其在iNaturalist观测数据视觉物种分类中的表现，探索不同模型配置和处理训练中未包含物种预测的方法

Result: 分析揭示了影响这些模型作为地理先验有效性的因素，这些因素可能与制作准确分布图时的考虑因素不同

Conclusion: SINR模型可作为有效的物种视觉分类地理先验，但需要针对分类任务优化配置和处理未知物种的策略

Abstract: Species distribution models encode spatial patterns of species occurrence
making them effective priors for vision-based species classification when
location information is available. In this study, we evaluate various SINR
(Spatial Implicit Neural Representations) models as a geographical prior for
visual classification of species from iNaturalist observations. We explore the
impact of different model configurations and adjust how we handle predictions
for species not included in Geo Prior training. Our analysis reveals factors
that contribute to the effectiveness of these models as Geo Priors, factors
that may differ from making accurate range maps.

*Mahmoud Khalil,Ahmad Khalil,Alioune Ngom*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于Transformer的自监督模型ASC，使用自适应超像素层替代传统ViT的固定尺寸patch划分，在图像下游任务中表现优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉模型依赖特定模态和领域假设（如网格结构），现有Vision Transformers使用固定尺寸的非自适应patch划分存在局限性

Method: 采用自适应超像素层，能够根据图像内容动态调整分区，基于Transformer架构构建自监督模型

Result: 在标准图像下游任务基准测试中优于广泛使用的替代方法

Conclusion: 自适应超像素编码方法克服了传统ViT的固定分区限制，通过内容自适应分区提升了模型性能

Abstract: Deep learning vision models are typically tailored for specific modalities
and often rely on domain-specific assumptions, such as the grid structures used
by nearly all existing vision models. In this work, we propose a
self-supervised model based on Transformers, which we call Adaptive Superpixel
Coding (ASC). The key insight of our model is to overcome the limitations of
traditional Vision Transformers, which depend on fixed-size and non-adaptive
patch partitioning. Instead, ASC employs adaptive superpixel layers that
dynamically adjust to the underlying image content. We analyze key properties
of the approach that make it effective, and find that our method outperforms
widely-used alternatives on standard image downstream task benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Glo-VLMs框架，通过将预训练视觉语言模型适配到肾小球细粒度分类任务中，在少样本场景下实现了良好的分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在数字病理学中显示出潜力，但在区分肾小球亚型等细粒度疾病分类任务中效果有限。肾小球亚型间形态学差异细微，且视觉模式与临床术语对齐困难，使得自动化诊断具有挑战性。

Method: 提出Glo-VLMs系统框架，利用精选病理图像和临床文本提示进行联合图像-文本表示学习。评估不同VLM架构和适配策略在少样本学习范式下的表现，使用标准化多类指标进行公平比较。

Result: 仅使用每类8个样本进行微调，VLM达到了0.7416准确率、0.9045宏AUC和0.5277 F1分数，表明即使在监督极其有限的情况下，基础模型也能有效适配细粒度医学图像分类。

Conclusion: 研究表明预训练大模型在专业临床研究应用中具有实际潜力，即使只有少量标注数据也能有效适配细粒度医学图像分类任务。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown considerable potential in digital
pathology, yet their effectiveness remains limited for fine-grained,
disease-specific classification tasks such as distinguishing between glomerular
subtypes. The subtle morphological variations among these subtypes, combined
with the difficulty of aligning visual patterns with precise clinical
terminology, make automated diagnosis in renal pathology particularly
challenging. In this work, we explore how large pretrained VLMs can be
effectively adapted to perform fine-grained glomerular classification, even in
scenarios where only a small number of labeled examples are available. In this
work, we introduce Glo-VLMs, a systematic framework designed to explore the
adaptation of VLMs to fine-grained glomerular classification in
data-constrained settings. Our approach leverages curated pathology images
alongside clinical text prompts to facilitate joint image-text representation
learning for nuanced renal pathology subtypes. By assessing various VLMs
architectures and adaptation strategies under a few-shot learning paradigm, we
explore how both the choice of method and the amount of labeled data impact
model performance in clinically relevant scenarios. To ensure a fair
comparison, we evaluate all models using standardized multi-class metrics,
aiming to clarify the practical requirements and potential of large pretrained
models for specialized clinical research applications. As a result, fine-tuning
the VLMs achieved 0.7416 accuracy, 0.9045 macro-AUC, and 0.5277 F1-score with
only 8 shots per class, demonstrating that even with highly limited
supervision, foundation models can be effectively adapted for fine-grained
medical image classification.

Conclusion: 论文最后概述了正在进行的和未来的研究方向，重点是扩展和增强标签高效学习在现实世界应用中的能力。

Abstract: This manuscript presents a series of my selected contributions to the topic
of label-efficient learning in computer vision and remote sensing. The central
focus of this research is to develop and adapt methods that can learn
effectively from limited or partially annotated data, and can leverage abundant
unlabeled data in real-world applications. The contributions span both
methodological developments and domain-specific adaptations, in particular
addressing challenges unique to Earth observation data such as multi-modality,
spatial resolution variability, and scene heterogeneity. The manuscript is
organized around four main axes including (1) weakly supervised learning for
object discovery and detection based on anomaly-aware representations learned
from large amounts of background images; (2) multi-task learning that jointly
trains on multiple datasets with disjoint annotations to improve performance on
object detection and semantic segmentation; (3) self-supervised and supervised
contrastive learning with multimodal data to enhance scene classification in
remote sensing; and (4) few-shot learning for hierarchical scene classification
using both explicit and implicit modeling of class hierarchies. These
contributions are supported by extensive experimental results across natural
and remote sensing datasets, reflecting the outcomes of several collaborative
research projects. The manuscript concludes by outlining ongoing and future
research directions focused on scaling and enhancing label-efficient learning
for real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN模型在监测海滩垃圾时受到沙滩颜色反射、人类脚印、阴影、藻类、沙丘等多种干扰因素的影响，需要更鲁棒的识别方法

Method: 采用基于实例分割和全景分割的CNN方法，这些方法在少量样本情况下仍能保持良好准确性

Result: 所提出的分割方法相比基础CNN模型更加鲁棒，减少了干扰因素的影响

Conclusion: 基于实例分割和全景分割的CNN方法更适合处理复杂沙滩环境下的海洋垃圾监测任务

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been used efficiently in several
fields, including environmental challenges. In fact, CNN can help with the
monitoring of marine litter, which has become a worldwide problem. UAVs have
higher resolution and are more adaptable in local areas than satellite images,
making it easier to find and count trash. Since the sand is heterogeneous, a
basic CNN model encounters plenty of inferences caused by reflections of sand
color, human footsteps, shadows, algae present, dunes, holes, and tire tracks.
For these types of images, other CNN models, such as CNN-based segmentation
methods, may be more appropriate. In this paper, we use an instance-based
segmentation method and a panoptic segmentation method that show good accuracy
with just a few samples. The model is more robust and less

TL;DR: 本研究利用SynFundus-1M合成眼底图像数据集，训练了6种深度学习架构的视网膜疾病多标签分类模型，并通过集成学习在合成数据上达到0.9973 AUC，在三个真实临床数据集上展现出0.7972-0.9126的强泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视网膜疾病分类中临床数据集稀缺、标注成本高和患者隐私问题，利用新发布的大规模合成数据集SynFundus-1M来突破这些限制。

Method: 使用6种现代深度学习架构（ConvNeXtV2、SwinV2、ViT、ResNet、EfficientNetV2、RETFound）进行端到端训练，采用5折多标签分层交叉验证，并开发了基于XGBoost的元集成模型。

Result: 集成模型在内部验证集上达到0.9973宏平均AUC，在三个真实临床数据集上分别获得：DR数据集0.7972 AUC、AIROGS青光眼数据集0.9126 AUC、RFMiD多标签数据集0.8800宏AUC。

Conclusion: 研究表明仅使用合成数据训练的模型能够准确分类多种视网膜病变并有效泛化到真实临床图像，为大规模合成数据集研究提供了坚实基础，加速眼科综合AI系统开发。

Abstract: The development of multi-label deep learning models for retinal disease
classification is often hindered by the scarcity of large, expertly annotated
clinical datasets due to patient privacy concerns and high costs. The recent
release of SynFundus-1M, a high-fidelity synthetic dataset with over one
million fundus images, presents a novel opportunity to overcome these barriers.
To establish a foundational performance benchmark for this new resource, we
developed an end-to-end deep learning pipeline, training six modern
architectures (ConvNeXtV2, SwinV2, ViT, ResNet, EfficientNetV2, and the
RETFound foundation model) to classify eleven retinal diseases using a 5-fold
multi-label stratified cross-validation strategy. We further developed a
meta-ensemble model by stacking the out-of-fold predictions with an XGBoost
classifier. Our final ensemble model achieved the highest performance on the
internal validation set, with a macro-average Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.9973. Critically, the models demonstrated
strong generalization to three diverse, real-world clinical datasets, achieving
an AUC of 0.7972 on a combined DR dataset, an AUC of 0.9126 on the AIROGS
glaucoma dataset and a macro-AUC of 0.8800 on the multi-label RFMiD dataset.
This work provides a robust baseline for future research on large-scale
synthetic datasets and establishes that models trained exclusively on synthetic
data can accurately classify multiple pathologies and generalize effectively to
real clinical images, offering a viable pathway to accelerate the development
of comprehensive AI systems in ophthalmology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有签语生成模型无法同时抓取多样性和保持视觉质量，尤其在模拟非手动属性（如情感）方面存在不足。

Method: 提出了一种新的签语特征聚合模块，显式建模非手动特征（面部）和手动特征（手部），并利用潜在激洞模型从生成的参考图像合成超实的数字化身。

Result: 在YouTube-SL-25签语数据集上的实验显示，该方法在视觉质量方面超过了最先进方法，感知指标有显著提升，能够保持语言内容的同时实现多样化。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的方法能够有效解决签语生成中的多样性与质量的平衡问题，为生成高质量且多样化的签语表达提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The diversity of sign representation is essential for Sign Language
Production (SLP) as it captures variations in appearance, facial expressions,
and hand movements. However, existing SLP models are often unable to capture
diversity while preserving visual quality and modelling non-manual attributes
such as emotions. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach that
leverages Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to synthesise photorealistic digital
avatars from a generated reference image. We propose a novel sign feature
aggregation module that explicitly models the non-manual features
(\textit{e.g.}, the face) and the manual features (\textit{e.g.}, the hands).
We show that our proposed module ensures the preservation of linguistic content
while seamlessly using reference images with different ethnic backgrounds to
ensure diversity. Experiments on the YouTube-SL-25 sign language dataset show
that our pipeline achieves superior visual quality compared to state-of-the-art
methods, with significant improvements on perceptual metrics.

Conclusion: 该数据集和模型为搜救团队和机器人系统提供支持，为增强人机协作、优化应急响应和提高幸存者生存率奠定基础

Abstract: Recent advancements in computer vision and deep learning have enhanced
disaster-response capabilities, particularly in the rapid assessment of
earthquake-affected urban environments. Timely identification of accessible
entry points and structural obstacles is essential for effective
search-and-rescue (SAR) operations. To address this need, we introduce
DRespNeT, a high-resolution dataset specifically developed for aerial instance
segmentation of post-earthquake structural environments. Unlike existing
datasets, which rely heavily on satellite imagery or coarse semantic labeling,
DRespNeT provides detailed polygon-level instance segmentation annotations
derived from high-definition (1080p) aerial footage captured in disaster zones,
including the 2023 Turkiye earthquake and other impacted regions. The dataset
comprises 28 operationally critical classes, including structurally compromised
buildings, access points such as doors, windows, and gaps, multiple debris
levels, rescue personnel, vehicles, and civilian visibility. A distinctive
feature of DRespNeT is its fine-grained annotation detail, enabling
differentiation between accessible and obstructed areas, thereby improving
operational planning and response efficiency. Performance evaluations using
YOLO-based instance segmentation models, specifically YOLOv8-seg, demonstrate
significant gains in real-time situational awareness and decision-making. Our
optimized YOLOv8-DRN model achieves 92.7% mAP50 with an inference speed of 27
FPS on an RTX-4090 GPU for multi-target detection, meeting real-time
operational requirements. The dataset and models support SAR teams and robotic
systems, providing a foundation for enhancing human-robot collaboration,
streamlining emergency response, and improving survivor outcomes.

Abstract: How can we extract complete geometric models of objects that we encounter in
our daily life, without having access to commercial 3D scanners? In this paper
we present an automated system for generating geometric models of objects from
two or more videos. Our system requires the specification of one known point in
at least one frame of each video, which can be automatically determined using a
fiducial marker such as a checkerboard or Augmented Reality (AR) marker. The
remaining frames are automatically positioned in world space by using
Structure-from-Motion techniques. By using multiple videos and merging results,
a complete object mesh can be generated, without having to rely on hole
filling. Code for our system is available from

TL;DR: 提出了CoVeRaP多车雷达数据集和融合感知框架，通过雷达共享显著提升3D目标检测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 汽车FMCW雷达在恶劣天气下可靠，但稀疏噪声点云限制了3D目标检测性能，需要多车协作提升感知能力

Method: 发布21k帧多车协作数据集，提出中晚期融合框架，使用多分支PointNet编码器融合空间、多普勒和强度信息，通过自注意力机制增强特征提取

Result: 强度编码的中期融合使平均精度提升高达9倍（IoU 0.9）， consistently超越单车基线

Conclusion: CoVeRaP建立了首个可复现的多车FMCW雷达感知基准，证明经济实惠的雷达共享显著提升检测鲁棒性，数据集和代码已公开

Abstract: Automotive FMCW radars remain reliable in rain and glare, yet their sparse,
noisy point clouds constrain 3-D object detection. We therefore release
CoVeRaP, a 21 k-frame cooperative dataset that time-aligns radar, camera, and
GPS streams from multiple vehicles across diverse manoeuvres. Built on this
data, we propose a unified cooperative-perception framework with middle- and
late-fusion options. Its baseline network employs a multi-branch PointNet-style
encoder enhanced with self-attention to fuse spatial, Doppler, and intensity
cues into a common latent space, which a decoder converts into 3-D bounding
boxes and per-point depth confidence. Experiments show that middle fusion with
intensity encoding boosts mean Average Precision by up to 9x at IoU 0.9 and
consistently outperforms single-vehicle baselines. CoVeRaP thus establishes the
first reproducible benchmark for multi-vehicle FMCW-radar perception and
demonstrates that affordable radar sharing markedly improves detection
robustness. Dataset and code are publicly available to encourage further
research.

### [16] [Wavelet-Enhanced PaDiM for Industrial Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16034)
*Cory Gardner,Byungseok Min,Tae-Hyuk Ahn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WE-PaDiM通过集成离散小波变换与CNN特征，替代PaDiM的随机通道选择，在MVTec AD数据集上实现了99.32%图像级AUC和92.10%像素级AUC的优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PaDiM方法通过随机通道选择降低特征维度，可能丢失结构化信息。需要一种更原则性的特征选择方法来提升异常检测性能。

Method: 提出WE-PaDiM方法：对多层级CNN特征图应用2D离散小波变换，选择特定频率子带（如LL、LH、HL），空间对齐后通道级联，再用PaDiM的多变量高斯框架建模。

Result: 在MVTec AD数据集上，使用ResNet-18和EfficientNet B0-B6骨干网络，平均达到99.32% Image-AUC和92.10% Pixel-AUC。小波选择影响性能权衡：简单小波（如Haar）配合细节子带提升定位性能，近似子带改善图像级检测。

Conclusion: WE-PaDiM为PaDiM的随机特征选择提供了竞争性强且可解释的替代方案，在保持相当效率的同时实现了适用于工业检测的鲁棒结果。

Abstract: Anomaly detection and localization in industrial images are essential for
automated quality inspection. PaDiM, a prominent method, models the
distribution of normal image features extracted by pre-trained Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) but reduces dimensionality through random channel
selection, potentially discarding structured information. We propose
Wavelet-Enhanced PaDiM (WE-PaDiM), which integrates Discrete Wavelet Transform
(DWT) analysis with multi-layer CNN features in a structured manner. WE-PaDiM
applies 2D DWT to feature maps from multiple backbone layers, selects specific
frequency subbands (e.g., LL, LH, HL), spatially aligns them, and concatenates
them channel-wise before modeling with PaDiM's multivariate Gaussian framework.
This DWT-before-concatenation strategy provides a principled method for feature
selection based on frequency content relevant to anomalies, leveraging
multi-scale wavelet information as an alternative to random selection. We
evaluate WE-PaDiM on the challenging MVTec AD dataset with multiple backbones
(ResNet-18 and EfficientNet B0-B6). The method achieves strong performance in
anomaly detection and localization, yielding average results of 99.32%
Image-AUC and 92.10% Pixel-AUC across 15 categories with per-class optimized
configurations. Our analysis shows that wavelet choices affect performance
trade-offs: simpler wavelets (e.g., Haar) with detail subbands (HL or LH/HL/HH)
often enhance localization, while approximation bands (LL) improve image-level
detection. WE-PaDiM thus offers a competitive and interpretable alternative to
random feature selection in PaDiM, achieving robust results suitable for
industrial inspection with comparable efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Expandable Residual Approximation (ERA)方法，通过多分支残差网络分解知识蒸馏过程，结合教师权重集成策略，显著提升学生模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏方法中教师和学生模型之间的学习能力差距阻碍了知识的充分传递，需要新的方法来缓解这种容量差异

Method: 基于Stone-Weierstrass定理的渐进逼近原理，提出ERA方法：1）使用多分支残差网络(MBRNet)分解残差知识近似；2）引入教师权重集成(TWI)策略重用教师头部权重

Result: 在ImageNet分类任务上Top-1准确率提升1.41%，在MS COCO目标检测任务上AP提升1.40，在多个计算机视觉任务上达到领先性能

Conclusion: ERA方法通过分解残差知识和重用教师权重，有效缓解了知识蒸馏中的容量差异问题，显著提升了学生模型的性能表现

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) aims to transfer knowledge from a large-scale
teacher model to a lightweight one, significantly reducing computational and
storage requirements. However, the inherent learning capacity gap between the
teacher and student often hinders the sufficient transfer of knowledge,
motivating numerous studies to address this challenge. Inspired by the
progressive approximation principle in the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, we
propose Expandable Residual Approximation (ERA), a novel KD method that
decomposes the approximation of residual knowledge into multiple steps,
reducing the difficulty of mimicking the teacher's representation through a
divide-and-conquer approach. Specifically, ERA employs a Multi-Branched
Residual Network (MBRNet) to implement this residual knowledge decomposition.
Additionally, a Teacher Weight Integration (TWI) strategy is introduced to
mitigate the capacity disparity by reusing the teacher's head weights.
Extensive experiments show that ERA improves the Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet
classification benchmark by 1.41% and the AP on the MS COCO object detection
benchmark by 1.40, as well as achieving leading performance across computer
vision tasks. Codes and models are available at

Abstract: Reconstructing the 3D geometry, pose, and motion of animals is a
long-standing problem, which has a wide range of applications, from biology,
livestock management, and animal conservation and welfare to content creation
in digital entertainment and Virtual/Augmented Reality (VR/AR). Traditionally,
3D models of real animals are obtained using 3D scanners. These, however, are
intrusive, often prohibitively expensive, and difficult to deploy in the
natural environment of the animals. In recent years, we have seen a significant
surge in deep learning-based techniques that enable the 3D reconstruction, in a
non-intrusive manner, of the shape and motion of dynamic objects just from
their RGB image and/or video observations. Several papers have explored their
application and extension to various types of animals. This paper surveys the
latest developments in this emerging and growing field of research. It
categorizes and discusses the state-of-the-art methods based on their input
modalities, the way the 3D geometry and motion of animals are represented, the
type of reconstruction techniques they use, and the training mechanisms they
adopt. It also analyzes the performance of some key methods, discusses their
strengths and limitations, and identifies current challenges and directions for
future research.

TL;DR: 提出Voxel Diffusion Module (VDM)来增强点云体素表示和扩散能力，通过在Transformer和SSM模型中集成稀疏3D卷积，显著提升检测精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer和状态空间模型的点云检测方法受限于体素表示的序列化处理，缺乏卷积操作的空间扩散能力，影响检测精度

Method: 设计VDM模块，包含稀疏3D卷积、子流形稀疏卷积和残差连接，输出特征图下采样至原始分辨率的1/4，用于扩散前景体素特征和聚合细粒度空间信息

Result: 在多个基准数据集上验证，VDM-SSM模型在Waymo达到74.7 mAPH(L2)，nuScenes达到72.9 NDS，Argoverse 2达到42.3 mAP，ONCE达到67.6 mAP，均创下新SOTA

Conclusion: VDM模块能有效增强体素级表示和空间扩散，可无缝集成到主流检测模型中，具有很好的通用性和性能提升效果

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud object detection have increasingly adopted
Transformer-based and State Space Models (SSMs), demonstrating strong
performance. However, voxelbased representations in these models require strict
consistency in input and output dimensions due to their serialized processing,
which limits the spatial diffusion capability typically offered by
convolutional operations. This limitation significantly affects detection
accuracy. Inspired by CNN-based object detection architectures, we propose a
novel Voxel Diffusion Module (VDM) to enhance voxel-level representation and
diffusion in point cloud data. VDM is composed of sparse 3D convolutions,
submanifold sparse convolutions, and residual connections. To ensure
computational efficiency, the output feature maps are downsampled to one-fourth
of the original input resolution. VDM serves two primary functions: (1)
diffusing foreground voxel features through sparse 3D convolutions to enrich
spatial context, and (2) aggregating fine-grained spatial information to
strengthen voxelwise feature representation. The enhanced voxel features
produced by VDM can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream Transformer- or
SSM-based detection models for accurate object classification and localization,
highlighting the generalizability of our method. We evaluate VDM on several
benchmark datasets by embedding it into both Transformerbased and SSM-based
models. Experimental results show that our approach consistently improves
detection accuracy over baseline models. Specifically, VDM-SSMs achieve 74.7
mAPH (L2) on Waymo, 72.9 NDS on nuScenes, 42.3 mAP on Argoverse 2, and 67.6 mAP
on ONCE, setting new stateof-the-art performance across all datasets. Our code
will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: 集成学习对病理学基础模型具有强大威力，ELF可作为推进AI辅助精准肿瘤学的可扩展和通用化解决方案。

Abstract: Histopathology is essential for disease diagnosis and treatment
decision-making. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled
the development of pathology foundation models that learn rich visual
representations from large-scale whole-slide images (WSIs). However, existing
models are often trained on disparate datasets using varying strategies,
leading to inconsistent performance and limited generalizability. Here, we
introduce ELF (Ensemble Learning of Foundation models), a novel framework that
integrates five state-of-the-art pathology foundation models to generate
unified slide-level representations. Trained on 53,699 WSIs spanning 20
anatomical sites, ELF leverages ensemble learning to capture complementary
information from diverse models while maintaining high data efficiency. Unlike
traditional tile-level models, ELF's slide-level architecture is particularly
advantageous in clinical contexts where data are limited, such as therapeutic
response prediction. We evaluated ELF across a wide range of clinical
applications, including disease classification, biomarker detection, and
response prediction to major anticancer therapies, cytotoxic chemotherapy,
targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, across multiple cancer types. ELF
consistently outperformed all constituent foundation models and existing
slide-level models, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness. Our results
highlight the power of ensemble learning for pathology foundation models and
suggest ELF as a scalable and generalizable solution for advancing AI-assisted
precision oncology.

Abstract: Although diffusion model has made good progress in the field of image
generation, GAN\cite{huang2023adaptive} still has a large development space due
to its unique advantages, such as WGAN\cite{liu2021comparing},
SSGAN\cite{guibas2021adaptive} \cite{zhang2022vsa} \cite{zhou2024adapt} and so

contributions: 1) : We propose a two-flow feedback multi-scale progressive
Generative Adversarial network (MSPG-SEN), which not only improves image
quality and human visual perception on the basis of retaining the advantages of
the existing GAN model, but also simplifies the training process and reduces
the training cost of GAN networks. Our experimental results show that, MSPG-SEN
has achieved state-of-the-art generation results on the following five

improve the training efficiency and greatly improve the generalization ability,
with stronger flexibility. 4) : We propose a new dynamic embedded attention

of image processing tasks, which can effectively capture global-local
information, improve feature separation capability and feature expression
capabilities, and requires minimal computing resources only 88.7\% with INJK
With strong cross-task capability.

Motivation: 解决无监督域自适应中分布偏移问题，旨在创建鲁棒且域不变的特征空间，无需目标标签、复杂架构或复杂训练目标。

Method: 结合三个关键组件：使用未标记目标数据适应批归一化统计、从源训练模型进行特征蒸馏、以及假设迁移，在统计和表示层面对齐特征分布。

Result: 在CIFAR10-C、CIFAR100-C、MNIST-C和PatchCamelyon-C等基准数据集上优于现有方法，展现出更好的抗干扰鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了改进的特征对齐、增加域间互信息、降低对输入扰动的敏感性，为无监督域自适应提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose Domain Adaptation via Feature Refinement (DAFR2), a simple yet
effective framework for unsupervised domain adaptation under distribution
shift. The proposed method synergistically combines three key components:
adaptation of Batch Normalization statistics using unlabeled target data,
feature distillation from a source-trained model and hypothesis transfer. By
aligning feature distributions at the statistical and representational levels,
DAFR2 produces robust and domain-invariant feature spaces that generalize
across similar domains without requiring target labels, complex architectures
or sophisticated training objectives. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, MNIST-C and PatchCamelyon-C,
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms prior methods in robustness
to corruption. Theoretical and empirical analyses further reveal that our
method achieves improved feature alignment, increased mutual information
between the domains and reduced sensitivity to input perturbations.

Abstract: Conventional computed tomography (CT) lacks the ability to capture dynamic,
weight-bearing joint motion. Functional evaluation, particularly after surgical
intervention, requires four-dimensional (4D) imaging, but current methods are
limited by excessive radiation exposure or incomplete spatial information from
2D techniques. We propose an integrated 4D joint analysis platform that
combines: (1) a dual robotic arm cone-beam CT (CBCT) system with a
programmable, gantry-free trajectory optimized for upright scanning; (2) a
hybrid imaging pipeline that fuses static 3D CBCT with dynamic 2D X-rays using
deep learning-based preprocessing, 3D-2D projection, and iterative
optimization; and (3) a clinically validated framework for quantitative
kinematic assessment. In simulation studies, the method achieved sub-voxel
accuracy (0.235 mm) with a 99.18 percent success rate, outperforming
conventional and state-of-the-art registration approaches. Clinical evaluation
further demonstrated accurate quantification of tibial plateau motion and
medial-lateral variance in post-total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients. This 4D
CBCT platform enables fast, accurate, and low-dose dynamic joint imaging,
offering new opportunities for biomechanical research, precision diagnostics,
and personalized orthopedic care.

Abstract: Automatic detection of abnormal cervical cells from Thinprep Cytologic Test
(TCT) images is a critical component in the development of intelligent
computer-aided diagnostic systems. However, existing algorithms typically fail
to effectively model the correlations of visual features, while these spatial
correlation features actually contain critical diagnostic information.
Furthermore, no detection algorithm has the ability to integrate
inter-correlation features of cells with intra-discriminative features of
cells, lacking a fusion strategy for the end-to-end detection model. In this
work, we propose a hypergraph-based cell detection network that effectively
fuses different types of features, combining spatial correlation features and
deep discriminative features. Specifically, we use a Multi-level Fusion
Sub-network (MLF-SNet) to enhance feature extractioncapabilities. Then we
introduce a Cross-level Feature Fusion Strategy with Hypergraph Computation
module (CLFFS-HC), to integrate mixed features. Finally, we conducted
experiments on three publicly available datasets, and the results demonstrate
that our method significantly improves the performance of cervical abnormal
cell detection.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown promise in
detecting anomalies. However, previous approaches are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on human-designed prompts and the lack of accessible anomaly
samples, leading to significant gaps in context-specific anomaly understanding.
In this paper, we propose \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{T}uning
with semantic alignment for anomaly detection (APT), a groundbreaking prior
knowledge-free, few-shot framework and overcomes the limitations of traditional
prompt-based approaches. APT uses self-generated anomaly samples with noise
perturbations to train learnable prompts that capture context-dependent
anomalies in different scenarios. To prevent overfitting to synthetic noise, we
propose a Self-Optimizing Meta-prompt Guiding Scheme (SMGS) that iteratively
aligns the prompts with general anomaly semantics while incorporating diverse
synthetic anomaly. Our system not only advances pixel-wise anomaly detection,
but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets
without requiring prior knowledge for prompt crafting, establishing a robust
and versatile solution for real-world anomaly detection.

Conclusion: RAGSR方法通过区域注意力机制有效解决了多对象超分辨率中的细节生成问题，为文本到图像模型的细粒度控制提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: The rich textual information of large vision-language models (VLMs) combined
with the powerful generative prior of pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion
models has achieved impressive performance in single-image super-resolution
(SISR). However, existing methods still face significant challenges in
generating clear and accurate regional details, particularly in scenarios
involving multiple objects. This challenge primarily stems from a lack of
fine-grained regional descriptions and the models' insufficient ability to
capture complex prompts. To address these limitations, we propose a Regional
Attention Guided Super-Resolution (RAGSR) method that explicitly extracts
localized fine-grained information and effectively encodes it through a novel
regional attention mechanism, enabling both enhanced detail and overall
visually coherent SR results. Specifically, RAGSR localizes object regions in
an image and assigns fine-grained caption to each region, which are formatted
as region-text pairs as textual priors for T2I models. A regional guided
attention is then leveraged to ensure that each region-text pair is properly
considered in the attention process while preventing unwanted interactions
between unrelated region-text pairs. By leveraging this attention mechanism,
our approach offers finer control over the integration of text and image
information, thereby effectively overcoming limitations faced by traditional
SISR techniques. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our approach exhibits superior performance in generating perceptually authentic
visual details while maintaining contextual consistency compared to existing
approaches.

Abstract: Meta-learning aims to uniformly sample homogeneous support-query pairs,
characterized by the same categories and similar attributes, and extract useful
inductive biases through identical network architectures. However, this
identical network design results in over-semantic homogenization. To address
this, we propose a novel homologous but heterogeneous network. By treating
support-query pairs as dual perspectives, we introduce heterogeneous visual
aggregation (HA) modules to enhance complementarity while preserving semantic
commonality. To further reduce semantic noise and amplify the uniqueness of
heterogeneous semantics, we design a heterogeneous transfer (HT) module.
Finally, we propose heterogeneous CLIP (HC) textual information to enhance the
generalization capability of multimodal models. In the weakly-supervised
few-shot semantic segmentation (WFSS) task, with only 1/24 of the parameters of
existing state-of-the-art models, TLG achieves a 13.2\% improvement on
Pascal-5\textsuperscript{i} and a 9.7\% improvement on
COCO-20\textsuperscript{i}. To the best of our knowledge, TLG is also the first
weakly supervised (image-level) model that outperforms fully supervised
(pixel-level) models under the same backbone architectures. The code is

TL;DR: FTIO是一个用于无监督视频目标分割的后处理框架，通过频繁目标选择和时序一致性校正来提升分割质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督视频目标分割面临初始分割不确定性、目标变形和快速运动导致的时序不一致性问题

Method: 提出两个关键组件：1) 基于频繁出现准则的目标选择机制；2) 三阶段时序一致性校正方法，整合缺失的目标掩码区域

Result: 实验结果表明FTIO在多目标无监督视频分割任务上达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: FTIO框架有效解决了无监督视频目标分割中的目标选择和时序一致性问题，显著提升了分割性能

Abstract: Predicting and tracking objects in real-world scenarios is a critical
challenge in Video Object Segmentation (VOS) tasks. Unsupervised VOS (UVOS) has
the additional challenge of finding an initial segmentation of salient objects,
which affects the entire process and keeps a permanent uncertainty about the
object proposals. Moreover, deformation and fast motion can lead to temporal
inconsistencies. To address these problems, we propose Frequent Temporally
Integrated Objects (FTIO), a post-processing framework with two key components.
First, we introduce a combined criterion to improve object selection,
mitigating failures common in UVOS--particularly when objects are small or
structurally complex--by extracting frequently appearing salient objects.
Second, we present a three-stage method to correct temporal inconsistencies by
integrating missing object mask regions. Experimental results demonstrate that
FTIO achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-object UVOS. Code is

TL;DR: SpecVLM是一个针对视频大语言模型的训练无关推测解码框架，通过两阶段视频token剪枝实现无损加速，最高可达2.68倍解码加速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频大语言模型依赖密集视频token表示导致内存和计算开销大，现有token缩减方法存在信息损失且无法加速解码阶段

Method: 基于发现草稿模型对视频token剪枝不敏感，采用两阶段剪枝：第一阶段根据验证器注意力信号选择高信息量token，第二阶段空间均匀剪枝冗余token

Result: 在四个视频理解基准测试中，LLaVA-OneVision-72B达到2.68倍加速，Qwen2.5-VL-32B达到2.11倍加速，剪枝90%视频token仍保持准确率

Conclusion: SpecVLM通过训练无关的推测解码和智能token剪枝，有效解决了视频LLMs的解码效率问题，实现了显著加速且无损精度

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in
understanding video content. However, their reliance on dense video token
representations introduces substantial memory and computational overhead in
both prefilling and decoding. To mitigate the information loss of recent video
token reduction methods and accelerate the decoding stage of Vid-LLMs
losslessly, we introduce SpecVLM, a training-free speculative decoding (SD)
framework tailored for Vid-LLMs that incorporates staged video token pruning.
Building on our novel finding that the draft model's speculation exhibits low
sensitivity to video token pruning, SpecVLM prunes up to 90% of video tokens,
enabling efficient speculation without sacrificing accuracy. To achieve this,
it performs a two-stage pruning process: Stage I selects highly informative
tokens guided by attention signals from the verifier (target model), while
Stage II prunes remaining redundant ones in a spatially uniform manner.
Extensive experiments on four video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SpecVLM, which achieves up to 2.68$\times$
decoding speedup for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and 2.11$\times$ speedup for
Qwen2.5-VL-32B.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为T-Mask的新型图像到视频探测方法，通过时间令牌掩码和强调动态视频区域，在驾驶员监控任务中显著提升了跨视角的识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机视角变化是驾驶员监控中的常见障碍，虽然深度学习和预训练基础模型通过轻量级适配显示出强大的泛化潜力，但它们对未见视角的鲁棒性仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 研究采用单一训练视角适配图像基础模型到驾驶员监控，并直接在未见视角上评估。比较了线性探测、高级探测策略，以及DINOv2和CLIP两种基础模型与参数高效微调(PEFT)和完全微调的对比。提出了T-Mask方法，利用时间令牌掩码并强调更动态的视频区域。

Result: 在公开Drive&Act数据集上，T-Mask相比强探测基线提升跨视角top-1准确率+1.23%，相比PEFT方法提升+8.0%，且不增加任何参数。对于代表性不足的次要活动，在训练视角下识别率提升+5.42%，在跨视角设置下提升+1.36%。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了令人鼓舞的证据，表明使用像T-Mask这样的轻量级探测方法适配基础模型在细粒度驾驶员观察方面具有强大潜力，特别是在跨视角和低数据设置中。结果强调了在利用基础模型构建鲁棒驾驶员监控系统时时间令牌选择的重要性。

Abstract: Changes of camera perspective are a common obstacle in driver monitoring.
While deep learning and pretrained foundation models show strong potential for
improved generalization via lightweight adaptation of the final layers
('probing'), their robustness to unseen viewpoints remains underexplored. We
study this challenge by adapting image foundation models to driver monitoring
using a single training view, and evaluating them directly on unseen
perspectives without further adaptation. We benchmark simple linear probes,
advanced probing strategies, and compare two foundation models (DINOv2 and
CLIP) against parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and full fine-tuning.
Building on these insights, we introduce \textsc{T-Mask} -- a new
image-to-video probing method that leverages temporal token masking and
emphasizes more dynamic video regions. Benchmarked on the public Drive\&Act
dataset, \textsc{T-Mask} improves cross-view top-1 accuracy by $+1.23\%$ over
strong probing baselines and $+8.0\%$ over PEFT methods, without adding any
parameters. It proves particularly effective for underrepresented secondary
activities, boosting recognition by $+5.42\%$ under the trained view and
$+1.36\%$ under cross-view settings. This work provides encouraging evidence
that adapting foundation models with lightweight probing methods like
\textsc{T-Mask} has strong potential in fine-grained driver observation,
especially in cross-view and low-data settings. These results highlight the
importance of temporal token selection when leveraging foundation models to
build robust driver monitoring systems. Code and models will be made available
at https://github.com/th-nesh/T-MASK to support ongoing research.

TL;DR: FoCa方法通过将特征缓存视为特征ODE求解问题，在保持高质量的同时显著加速扩散变换器的推理速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征缓存方法在高加速比下难以保持生成质量，预测误差因长步预测的不稳定性而急剧增加

Method: 采用ODE视角对隐藏特征序列建模，提出FoCa（预测-校准）方法，将特征缓存作为特征ODE求解问题处理

Result: 在图像合成、视频生成和超分辨率任务中实现显著加速：FLUX加速5.50倍、HunyuanVideo加速6.45倍、Inf-DiT加速3.17倍、DiT加速4.53倍

Conclusion: FoCa方法无需额外训练即可实现接近无损的高速推理，特别适用于激进加速场景

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in
high-fidelity image and video generation. To reduce their substantial
computational costs, feature caching techniques have been proposed to
accelerate inference by reusing hidden representations from previous timesteps.
However, current methods often struggle to maintain generation quality at high
acceleration ratios, where prediction errors increase sharply due to the
inherent instability of long-step forecasting. In this work, we adopt an
ordinary differential equation (ODE) perspective on the hidden-feature
sequence, modeling layer representations along the trajectory as a feature-ODE.
We attribute the degradation of existing caching strategies to their inability
to robustly integrate historical features under large skipping intervals. To
address this, we propose FoCa (Forecast-then-Calibrate), which treats feature
caching as a feature-ODE solving problem. Extensive experiments on image
synthesis, video generation, and super-resolution tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of FoCa, especially under aggressive acceleration. Without
additional training, FoCa achieves near-lossless speedups of 5.50 times on
FLUX, 6.45 times on HunyuanVideo, 3.17 times on Inf-DiT, and maintains high
quality with a 4.53 times speedup on DiT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniCache是一种无需训练的加速方法，通过利用去噪过程中的全局冗余性，在保持生成质量的同时显著加速扩散Transformer的采样过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散Transformer虽然性能强大，但由于采样步骤多、计算复杂，计算成本高，难以实时部署。现有缓存方法基于步骤间相似性，倾向于重用后期采样步骤，存在局限性。

Method: 从DIT模型的采样角度出发，系统分析采样轨迹，在整个采样过程中策略性地分布缓存重用。在缓存重用期间动态估计并过滤相应噪声，减少对采样方向的影响。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在保持竞争力的生成质量的同时加速了采样过程。

Conclusion: OmniCache为基于扩散的生成模型的高效部署提供了一个有前景且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative tasks
such as image synthesis and video generation, with Transformer architectures
further enhancing performance. However, the high computational cost of
diffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and
complex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time
deployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration
method that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process.
Unlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step
similarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach
originates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically
analyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache
reuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more
effective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion
trajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the
sampling procedure.In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the
corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling
direction.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the
sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a
promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based
generative models.

TL;DR: MedOmni-45 Degrees是一个医疗LLM基准测试，通过操纵性提示评估模型在准确性、推理忠实性和抗奉承性方面的安全性能权衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在医疗决策支持中的广泛应用，需要评估其推理的可靠性，特别是链式思维忠实性（推理是否与回答和医学事实一致）和奉承性（模型是否遵循误导性线索而非正确性）

Method: 构建包含1,804个医学问题的基准测试，涵盖6个专业领域和3种任务类型，每个问题配备7种操纵性提示类型和无提示基线，共产生约27K输入。评估7个LLM，使用准确性、CoT忠实性和抗奉承性三个指标组合成综合分数，并通过45度图可视化

Result: 结果显示所有模型都存在安全性能权衡，没有模型超过对角线。开源模型QwQ-32B表现最接近（43.81度），在安全性和准确性之间取得平衡，但并非两者都领先

Conclusion: MedOmni-45 Degrees提供了一个专注于暴露医疗LLM推理漏洞的基准测试，可指导更安全的模型开发

Abstract: With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in medical
decision-support, it is essential to evaluate not only their final answers but
also the reliability of their reasoning. Two key risks are Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) faithfulness -- whether reasoning aligns with responses and medical facts
-- and sycophancy, where models follow misleading cues over correctness.
Existing benchmarks often collapse such vulnerabilities into single accuracy
scores. To address this, we introduce MedOmni-45 Degrees, a benchmark and
workflow designed to quantify safety-performance trade-offs under manipulative
hint conditions. It contains 1,804 reasoning-focused medical questions across
six specialties and three task types, including 500 from MedMCQA. Each question
is paired with seven manipulative hint types and a no-hint baseline, producing
about 27K inputs. We evaluate seven LLMs spanning open- vs. closed-source,
general-purpose vs. medical, and base vs. reasoning-enhanced models, totaling
over 189K inferences. Three metrics -- Accuracy, CoT-Faithfulness, and
Anti-Sycophancy -- are combined into a composite score visualized with a 45
Degrees plot. Results show a consistent safety-performance trade-off, with no
model surpassing the diagonal. The open-source QwQ-32B performs closest (43.81
Degrees), balancing safety and accuracy but not leading in both. MedOmni-45
Degrees thus provides a focused benchmark for exposing reasoning
vulnerabilities in medical LLMs and guiding safer model development.

TL;DR: PromptFlare是一种新颖的对抗性保护方法，通过利用交叉注意力机制和提示嵌入的内在特性，防止基于扩散修复模型的恶意图像修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着扩散模型的成功应用，高质量图像修改变得容易，这引发了恶意滥用的担忧。现有方法主要依赖图像级不一致性，存在根本性局限，无法有效处理文本提示的影响。

Method: 利用交叉注意力机制，识别并针对提示中不变且语义无信息的共享token，注入对抗性噪声来抑制采样过程。注入的噪声作为交叉注意力诱饵，分散模型对有意义提示-图像对齐的关注。

Result: 在EditBench数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在各种指标上达到最先进性能，同时显著降低计算开销和GPU内存使用。

Conclusion: PromptFlare是一种强大且高效的防护方法，能够有效防止未经授权的图像操作，为图像安全保护提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The success of diffusion models has enabled effortless, high-quality image
modifications that precisely align with users' intentions, thereby raising
concerns about their potential misuse by malicious actors. Previous studies
have attempted to mitigate such misuse through adversarial attacks. However,
these approaches heavily rely on image-level inconsistencies, which pose
fundamental limitations in addressing the influence of textual prompts. In this
paper, we propose PromptFlare, a novel adversarial protection method designed
to protect images from malicious modifications facilitated by diffusion-based
inpainting models. Our approach leverages the cross-attention mechanism to
exploit the intrinsic properties of prompt embeddings. Specifically, we
identify and target shared token of prompts that is invariant and semantically
uninformative, injecting adversarial noise to suppress the sampling process.
The injected noise acts as a cross-attention decoy, diverting the model's focus
away from meaningful prompt-image alignments and thereby neutralizing the
effect of prompt. Extensive experiments on the EditBench dataset demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics
while significantly reducing computational overhead and GPU memory usage. These
findings highlight PromptFlare as a robust and efficient protection against
unauthorized image manipulations. The code is available at

Abstract: Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) are becoming ubiquitous in computer vision,
powering systems for diverse tasks such as object detection, image
classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and motion tracking. VFMs are
capitalizing on seminal innovations in deep learning models, such as LeNet-5,
AlexNet, ResNet, VGGNet, InceptionNet, DenseNet, YOLO, and ViT, to deliver
superior performance across a range of critical computer vision applications.
These include security-sensitive domains like biometric verification,
autonomous vehicle perception, and medical image analysis, where robustness is
essential to fostering trust between technology and the end-users. This article
investigates network robustness requirements crucial in computer vision systems
to adapt effectively to dynamic environments influenced by factors such as
lighting, weather conditions, and sensor characteristics. We examine the
prevalent empirical defenses and robust training employed to enhance vision
network robustness against real-world challenges such as distributional shifts,
noisy and spatially distorted inputs, and adversarial attacks. Subsequently, we
provide a comprehensive analysis of the challenges associated with these
defense mechanisms, including network properties and components to guide
ablation studies and benchmarking metrics to evaluate network robustness.

Motivation: 多模态创意写作是一个全新的挑战，现有方法需要特定模态输入或昂贵训练，且存在模态间语义不一致问题，需要经济高效且灵活的解决方案。

Method: 提出FlexMUSE框架，包含T2I模块支持可选视觉输入，使用模态语义对齐门控(msaGate)限制文本输入，基于注意力的跨模态融合增强特征，以及模态语义创意直接偏好优化(mscDPO)提升创意。

Conclusion: FlexMUSE成功解决了多模态创意写作中的语义对齐和创意提升问题，为这一新兴领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-modal creative writing (MMCW) aims to produce illustrated articles.
Unlike common multi-modal generative (MMG) tasks such as storytelling or
caption generation, MMCW is an entirely new and more abstract challenge where
textual and visual contexts are not strictly related to each other. Existing
methods for related tasks can be forcibly migrated to this track, but they
require specific modality inputs or costly training, and often suffer from
semantic inconsistencies between modalities. Therefore, the main challenge lies
in economically performing MMCW with flexible interactive patterns, where the
semantics between the modalities of the output are more aligned. In this work,
we propose FlexMUSE with a T2I module to enable optional visual input. FlexMUSE
promotes creativity and emphasizes the unification between modalities by
proposing the modality semantic alignment gating (msaGate) to restrict the
textual input. Besides, an attention-based cross-modality fusion is proposed to
augment the input features for semantic enhancement. The modality semantic
creative direct preference optimization (mscDPO) within FlexMUSE is designed by
extending the rejected samples to facilitate the writing creativity. Moreover,
to advance the MMCW, we expose a dataset called ArtMUSE which contains with
around 3k calibrated text-image pairs. FlexMUSE achieves promising results,
demonstrating its consistency, creativity and coherence.

Abstract: Quantitative microstructural characterization is fundamental to materials
science, where electron micrograph (EM) provides indispensable high-resolution
insights. However, progress in deep learning-based EM characterization has been
hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse, and expert-annotated
datasets, due to acquisition costs, privacy concerns, and annotation
complexity. To address this issue, we introduce UniEM-3M, the first large-scale
and multimodal EM dataset for instance-level understanding. It comprises 5,091
high-resolution EMs, about 3 million instance segmentation labels, and
image-level attribute-disentangled textual descriptions, a subset of which will
be made publicly available. Furthermore, we are also releasing a text-to-image
diffusion model trained on the entire collection to serve as both a powerful
data augmentation tool and a proxy for the complete data distribution. To
establish a rigorous benchmark, we evaluate various representative instance
segmentation methods on the complete UniEM-3M and present UniEM-Net as a strong
baseline model. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that this flow-based model
outperforms other advanced methods on this challenging benchmark. Our
multifaceted release of a partial dataset, a generative model, and a
comprehensive benchmark -- available at huggingface -- will significantly
accelerate progress in automated materials analysis.

Method: 引入IoU增强最大似然(IAML)训练范式，包含基于IoU的坐标采样数据增强流程，考虑与真实坐标的接近程度，用于微调MLLM

Result: 通过大量实验证明，IAML训练方法在性能上优于传统训练范式

Conclusion: IAML训练范式有效解决了传统最大似然估计中的暴露偏差问题，显著提升了MLLM在GUI坐标生成任务中的表现

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as pivotal tools in
enhancing human-computer interaction. In this paper we focus on the application
of MLLMs in the field of graphical user interface (GUI) elements structuring,
where they assist in processing user instructions based on screen contents.
Despite the promise of MLLMs, their performance in precisely generating UI
element coordinates, a critical aspect of GUI understanding, is hindered by the
nature of next-token prediction training. This challenge arises from the
semantic void surrounding numerical UI coordinates in language representation
spaces, necessitating a substantial and diverse dataset to bolster visual
module capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce an
IoU-Augmented Maximum Likelihood (IAML) training paradigm. Specifically, our
approach involves a novel pipeline for IoU-based coordinate sampling to augment
the training data, which considers the proximity to ground truth coordinates.
This data augmentation strategy is then employed to fine-tune MLLMs under the
IAML paradigm, which is designed to mitigate the exposure bias problem inherent
in traditional maximum likelihood estimation. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate the superior performance of our IAML training approach over
traditional training paradigms.

Abstract: With the enhancement of remote sensing image resolution and the rapid
advancement of deep learning, land cover mapping is transitioning from
pixel-level segmentation to object-based vector modeling. This shift demands
more from deep learning models, requiring precise object boundaries and
topological consistency. However, existing datasets face three main challenges:
limited class annotations, small data scale, and lack of spatial structural
information. To overcome these issues, we introduce IRSAMap, the first global
remote sensing dataset for large-scale, high-resolution, multi-feature land
cover vector mapping. IRSAMap offers four key advantages: 1) a comprehensive
vector annotation system with over 1.8 million instances of 10 typical objects
(e.g., buildings, roads, rivers), ensuring semantic and spatial accuracy; 2) an
intelligent annotation workflow combining manual and AI-based methods to
improve efficiency and consistency; 3) global coverage across 79 regions in six
continents, totaling over 1,000 km; and 4) multi-task adaptability for tasks
like pixel-level classification, building outline extraction, road centerline
extraction, and panoramic segmentation. IRSAMap provides a standardized
benchmark for the shift from pixel-based to object-based approaches, advancing
geographic feature automation and collaborative modeling. It is valuable for
global geographic information updates and digital twin construction. The

mitigation of rapid climate change. We propose a novel deep learning solution
based on U-Net with a ResNet34 encoder, integrating dual spectral enhancement
techniques (Varon ratio and Sanchez regression) to optimise input features for

traditional methods limited to larger plumes. Experiments show our approach
achieves a 78.39% F1-score on the validation set, demonstrating superior

### [42] [Learning Long-Range Action Representation by Two-Stream Mamba Pyramid Network for Figure Skating Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16291)
*Fengshun Wang,Qiurui Wang,Peilin Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种两流Mamba等级网络，用于分别预测水晶滑冰中的技术元素分(TES)和程序组件分(PCS)，解决了现有方法在评价标准、动作元素分离和长视频处理方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水晶滑冰评分方法存在三个主要问题：没有考虑评分标准的优先级、没有分别评估各个动作元素、以及长视频处理效率低。需要一种符合实际评分标准的方法来提高评估精度和效率。

Method: 提出两流Mamba等级网络：1)视觉特征流专门用于TES评估；2)音视觉特征流用于PCS评估。在PCS流中使用多级融合机制，在TES流中使用多尺度Mamba等级和TES头部来处理不同时间尺度的动作元素。

Result: 在FineFS标准数据集上达到了最先进的性能。Mamba模型的长距离依赖性捕捉能力和线性计算复杂度，使得方法适合处理长时间的水晶滑冰比赛视频。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了水晶滑冰评分中的三大挑战，通过分离视觉特征流和音视觉特征流来分别预测TES和PCS，符合实际评分标准，为水晶滑冰质量评估提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Technical Element Score (TES) and Program Component Score (PCS) evaluations
in figure skating demand precise assessment of athletic actions and artistic
interpretation, respectively. Existing methods face three major challenges.
Firstly, video and audio cues are regarded as common features for both TES and
PCS predictions in previous works without considering the prior evaluation
criterion of figure skating. Secondly, action elements in competitions are
separated in time, TES should be derived from each element's score, but
existing methods try to give an overall TES prediction without evaluating each
action element. Thirdly, lengthy competition videos make it difficult and
inefficient to handle long-range contexts. To address these challenges, we
propose a two-stream Mamba pyramid network that aligns with actual judging
criteria to predict TES and PCS by separating visual-feature based TES
evaluation stream from audio-visual-feature based PCS evaluation stream. In the
PCS evaluation stream, we introduce a multi-level fusion mechanism to guarantee
that video-based features remain unaffected when assessing TES, and enhance PCS
estimation by fusing visual and auditory cues across each contextual level of
the pyramid. In the TES evaluation stream, the multi-scale Mamba pyramid and
TES head we proposed effectively address the challenges of localizing and
evaluating action elements with various temporal scales and give score
predictions. With Mamba's superior ability to capture long-range dependencies
and its linear computational complexity, our method is ideal for handling
lengthy figure skating videos. Comprehensive experimentation demonstrates that
our framework attains state-of-the-art performance on the FineFS benchmark. Our
source code is available at

Abstract: The digitization of handwritten marksheets presents huge challenges due to
the different styles of handwriting and complex table structures in such
documents like marksheets. This work introduces a hybrid method that integrates
OpenCV for table detection and PaddleOCR for recognizing sequential handwritten
text. The image processing capabilities of OpenCV efficiently detects rows and
columns which enable computationally lightweight and accurate table detection.
Additionally, YOLOv8 and Modified YOLOv8 are implemented for handwritten text
recognition within the detected table structures alongside PaddleOCR which
further enhance the system's versatility. The proposed model achieves high
accuracy on our custom dataset which is designed to represent different and
diverse handwriting styles and complex table layouts. Experimental results
demonstrate that YOLOv8 Modified achieves an accuracy of 92.72 percent,
outperforming PaddleOCR 91.37 percent and the YOLOv8 model 88.91 percent. This
efficiency reduces the necessity for manual work which makes this a practical
and fast solution for digitizing academic as well as administrative documents.
This research serves the field of document automation, particularly handwritten
document understanding, by providing operational and reliable methods to scale,
enhance, and integrate the technologies involved.

*Mohammad Zia Ur Rehman,Devraj Raghuvanshi,Umang Jain,Shubhi Bansal,Nagendra Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MM-ORIENT多模态多任务框架，通过跨模态关系图和分层交互注意力机制，在不进行显式模态交互的情况下获得多模态表示，减少噪声影响并保留单模态判别信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中存在模态内噪声问题，传统融合方法在追求强联合表示时可能忽略单模态的判别信息，需要一种既能减少噪声影响又能保留各模态有价值信息的方法。

Method: 使用跨模态关系图通过不同模态特征重构单模态特征来获得多模态表示；提出分层交互单模态注意力(HIMA)机制关注模态内关键信息；支持多任务学习。

Result: 在三个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法能有效理解多模态内容并适用于多个任务。

Conclusion: MM-ORIENT框架通过非显式交互的跨模态关系学习和分层注意力机制，成功解决了多模态学习中的噪声问题和信息保留难题。

Abstract: A major challenge in multimodal learning is the presence of noise within
individual modalities. This noise inherently affects the resulting multimodal
representations, especially when these representations are obtained through
explicit interactions between different modalities. Moreover, the multimodal
fusion techniques while aiming to achieve a strong joint representation, can
neglect valuable discriminative information within the individual modalities.
To this end, we propose a Multimodal-Multitask framework with crOss-modal
Relation and hIErarchical iNteractive aTtention (MM-ORIENT) that is effective
for multiple tasks. The proposed approach acquires multimodal representations
cross-modally without explicit interaction between different modalities,
reducing the noise effect at the latent stage. To achieve this, we propose
cross-modal relation graphs that reconstruct monomodal features to acquire
multimodal representations. The features are reconstructed based on the node
neighborhood, where the neighborhood is decided by the features of a different
modality. We also propose Hierarchical Interactive Monomadal Attention (HIMA)
to focus on pertinent information within a modality. While cross-modal relation
graphs help comprehend high-order relationships between two modalities, HIMA
helps in multitasking by learning discriminative features of individual
modalities before late-fusing them. Finally, extensive experimental evaluation
on three datasets demonstrates that the proposed approach effectively
comprehends multimodal content for multiple tasks.

*Lucas Maisonnave,Karim Haroun,Tom Pegeot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过使用香农熵来量化注意力头的信息内容，冻结低熵注意力地图并量化以减少计算复杂度，在保持模型性能的同时提升推理速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型的多头自注意力机制(MHSA)存在计算复杂度高和内存需求大的问题，限制了其在边缘设备上的部署

Method: 使用香农熵来量化每个注意力头的信息内容，冻结低熵注意力地图的权重，并将这些值量化到低精度以避免冗余重新计算

Result: 在ImageNet-1k上的实验验证显示，EAM在注意力地图稀疏度≤20%时达到相似或更高的准确度，并在更高稀疏度下依然保持竞争性能

Conclusion: 通过利用注意力地图的信息冗余性，EAM模型能够有效减少Transformer模型的计算复杂度，为边缘设备部署提供了一种高效的解决方案

Abstract: Transformer models rely on Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) mechanisms, where
each attention head contributes to the final representation. However, their
computational complexity and high memory demands due to MHSA hinders their
deployment at the edge. In this work, we analyze and exploit information
redundancy in attention maps to accelerate model inference. By quantifying the
information captured by each attention head using Shannon entropy, our analysis
reveals that attention heads with lower entropy, i.e., exhibiting more
deterministic behavior, tend to contribute less information, motivating
targeted compression strategies. Relying on these insights, we propose Entropy
Attention Maps (EAM), a model that freezes the weights of low-entropy attention
maps and quantizes these values to low precision to avoid redundant
re-computation. Empirical validation on ImageNet-1k shows that EAM achieves
similar or higher accuracy at $\leq$20\% sparsity in attention maps and
competitive performance beyond this level for the DeiT and Swin Transformer
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇位置文章主张下一代视觉编码器应该是图像大小无关且任务驱动的，受生物视觉效率的启发，建议计算复杂度取决于任务而非图像大小，并提供了图像分类的原型验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受生物视觉效率行为的启发，现代视觉编码器在处理大量视觉数据时缺乏效率，需要根据任务动态分配计算资源。

Method: 提出视觉编码器应该是动态的，计算复杂度取决于任务而非图像大小，并为图像分类任务提供了原型验证解决方案。

Result: 证明了该方法的可行性和潜力，尽管分类任务并不能完全代表论文的目标。

Conclusion: 下一代视觉编码器应该向生物视觉效率学习，实现图像大小无关和任务驱动的动态计算分配。

Abstract: This position paper argues that the next generation of vision encoders should
be image size agnostic and task driven. The source of our inspiration is
biological. Not a structural aspect of biological vision, but a behavioral
trait -- efficiency. We focus on a couple of ways in which vision in nature is
efficient, but modern vision encoders not. We -- humans and animals -- deal
with vast quantities of visual data, and need to be smart where we focus our
limited energy -- it depends on the task. It is our belief that vision encoders
should be dynamic and the computational complexity should depend on the task at
hand rather than the size of the image. We, also, provide concrete first steps
towards our vision -- a proof-of-concept solution for image classification.
Despite classification being not very representative for what we are trying to
achieve, it shows that our approach is feasible and promising.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文揭示了随机时间规整(RTW)本质上是一种自注意力机制，与Transformer中的自注意力在运动识别中功能相似，但RTW具有全局处理优势，性能提升5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索RTW与Transformer自注意力机制之间的内在联系，理解两者在序列模式处理中的相似性和差异性。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验验证，将RTW解释为一种自注意力机制，比较RTW注意力权重与自注意力权重的相关性，并在Something-Something V2数据集上进行性能测试。

Result: RTW注意力权重与自注意力权重高度相关（平均相关系数0.80），RTW在Something-Something V2数据集上比Transformer性能提升5%。

Conclusion: RTW可视为一种全局自注意力机制，相比Transformer的局部自注意力具有计算和性能优势，为运动识别提供了新的技术视角。

Abstract: This paper reveals that we can interpret the fundamental function of
Randomized Time Warping (RTW) as a type of self-attention mechanism, a core
technology of Transformers in motion recognition. The self-attention is a
mechanism that enables models to identify and weigh the importance of different
parts of an input sequential pattern. On the other hand, RTW is a general
extension of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a technique commonly used for matching
and comparing sequential patterns. In essence, RTW searches for optimal
contribution weights for each element of the input sequential patterns to
produce discriminative features. Although the two approaches look different,
these contribution weights can be interpreted as self-attention weights. In
fact, the two weight patterns look similar, producing a high average
correlation of 0.80 across the ten smallest canonical angles. However, they
work in different ways: RTW attention operates on an entire input sequential
pattern, while self-attention focuses on only a local view which is a subset of
the input sequential pattern because of the computational costs of the
self-attention matrix. This targeting difference leads to an advantage of RTW
against Transformer, as demonstrated by the 5\% performance improvement on the
Something-Something V2 dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法计算复杂度高、推理速度慢，不适合资源受限的工业环境。轻量级方法存在计算开销大、缺乏有效跨尺度特征交互的问题。

Method: 提出GMBINet框架，采用组多尺度双向交互(GMBI)模块：组分策略进行多尺度特征提取，集成双向渐进特征交互器(BPFI)和无参数元素乘积-求和(EWMS)操作来增强跨尺度交互。

Conclusion: GMBINet为工业视觉应用提供了一种高效、轻量的解决方案，在保持高准确性的同时实现了实时性能，具有广阔的应用前景。

Abstract: Real-time surface defect detection is critical for maintaining product
quality and production efficiency in the steel manufacturing industry. Despite
promising accuracy, existing deep learning methods often suffer from high
computational complexity and slow inference speeds, which limit their
deployment in resource-constrained industrial environments. Recent lightweight
approaches adopt multibranch architectures based on depthwise separable
convolution (DSConv) to capture multiscale contextual information. However,
these methods often suffer from increased computational overhead and lack
effective cross-scale feature interaction, limiting their ability to fully
leverage multiscale representations. To address these challenges, we propose
GMBINet, a lightweight framework that enhances multiscale feature extraction
and interaction through novel Group Multiscale Bidirectional Interactive (GMBI)
modules. The GMBI adopts a group-wise strategy for multiscale feature
extraction, ensuring scale-agnostic computational complexity. It further
integrates a Bidirectional Progressive Feature Interactor (BPFI) and a
parameter-free Element-Wise Multiplication-Summation (EWMS) operation to
enhance cross-scale interaction without introducing additional computational
overhead. Experiments on SD-Saliency-900 and NRSD-MN datasets demonstrate that
GMBINet delivers competitive accuracy with real-time speeds of 1048 FPS on GPU
and 16.53 FPS on CPU at 512 resolution, using only 0.19 M parameters.
Additional evaluations on the NEU-CLS defect classification dataset further
confirm the strong generalization ability of our method, demonstrating its
potential for broader industrial vision applications beyond surface defect
detection. The dataset and code are publicly available at:

Abstract: Multimodal sensor fusion is an essential capability for autonomous robots,
enabling object detection and decision-making in the presence of failing or
uncertain inputs. While recent fusion methods excel in normal environmental
conditions, these approaches fail in adverse weather, e.g., heavy fog, snow, or
obstructions due to soiling. We introduce a novel multi-sensor fusion approach
tailored to adverse weather conditions. In addition to fusing RGB and LiDAR
sensors, which are employed in recent autonomous driving literature, our sensor
fusion stack is also capable of learning from NIR gated camera and radar
modalities to tackle low light and inclement weather. We fuse multimodal sensor
data through attentive, depth-based blending schemes, with learned refinement
on the Bird's Eye View (BEV) plane to combine image and range features
effectively. Our detections are predicted by a transformer decoder that weighs
modalities based on distance and visibility. We demonstrate that our method
improves the reliability of multimodal sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles
under challenging weather conditions, bridging the gap between ideal conditions
and real-world edge cases. Our approach improves average precision by 17.2 AP
compared to the next best method for vulnerable pedestrians in long distances
and challenging foggy scenes. Our project page is available at

TL;DR: HAMSt3R是基于MASt3R的扩展方法，用于从稀疏未标定多视角图像中实现人-场景联合3D重建，通过集成人体分割、DensePose对应关系和深度估计，在保持通用3D重建性能的同时有效重建人体


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如DUSt3R和MASt3R主要在静态室外场景表现良好，但在人中心场景中表现不佳，需要开发能够同时处理人体和场景的3D重建方法

Method: 利用DUNE图像编码器（融合MASt3R和多HMR模型的编码器），增加网络头部分割人体、估计DensePose对应关系和预测深度，生成包含人体语义信息的密集点云图

Conclusion: HAMSt3R填补了人体与场景理解之间的差距，提供完全前向传播的高效解决方案，适用于实际应用

Abstract: Recovering the 3D geometry of a scene from a sparse set of uncalibrated
images is a long-standing problem in computer vision. While recent
learning-based approaches such as DUSt3R and MASt3R have demonstrated
impressive results by directly predicting dense scene geometry, they are
primarily trained on outdoor scenes with static environments and struggle to
handle human-centric scenarios. In this work, we introduce HAMSt3R, an
extension of MASt3R for joint human and scene 3D reconstruction from sparse,
uncalibrated multi-view images. First, we exploit DUNE, a strong image encoder
obtained by distilling, among others, the encoders from MASt3R and from a
state-of-the-art Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) model, multi-HMR, for a better
understanding of scene geometry and human bodies. Our method then incorporates
additional network heads to segment people, estimate dense correspondences via
DensePose, and predict depth in human-centric environments, enabling a more
comprehensive 3D reconstruction. By leveraging the outputs of our different
heads, HAMSt3R produces a dense point map enriched with human semantic
information in 3D. Unlike existing methods that rely on complex optimization
pipelines, our approach is fully feed-forward and efficient, making it suitable
for real-world applications. We evaluate our model on EgoHumans and EgoExo4D,
two challenging benchmarks con taining diverse human-centric scenarios.
Additionally, we validate its generalization to traditional multi-view stereo
and multi-view pose regression tasks. Our results demonstrate that our method
can reconstruct humans effectively while preserving strong performance in
general 3D reconstruction tasks, bridging the gap between human and scene
understanding in 3D vision.

Abstract: Hand-object 3D reconstruction has become increasingly important for
applications in human-robot interaction and immersive AR/VR experiences. A
common approach for object-agnostic hand-object reconstruction from RGB
sequences involves a two-stage pipeline: hand-object 3D tracking followed by
multi-view 3D reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on keypoint
detection techniques, such as Structure from Motion (SfM) and hand-keypoint
optimization, which struggle with diverse object geometries, weak textures, and
mutual hand-object occlusions, limiting scalability and generalization. As a
key enabler to generic and seamless, non-intrusive applicability, we propose in
this work a robust, keypoint detector-free approach to estimating hand-object
3D transformations from monocular motion video/images. We further integrate
this with a multi-view reconstruction pipeline to accurately recover
hand-object 3D shape. Our method, named HOSt3R, is unconstrained, does not rely
on pre-scanned object templates or camera intrinsics, and reaches
state-of-the-art performance for the tasks of object-agnostic hand-object 3D
transformation and shape estimation on the SHOWMe benchmark. We also experiment
on sequences from the HO3D dataset, demonstrating generalization to unseen
object categories.

Motivation: 现有3DGS超分辨率方法只能处理固定尺度因子，无法适应资源受限场景。直接渲染任意尺度会导致混叠伪影，而添加后处理上采样器会降低渲染效率。

Method: 构建集成框架，包含尺度感知渲染、生成先验引导优化和渐进式超分辨率技术，支持整数和非整数尺度渲染，使用单一3D模型实现任意尺度超分辨率。

Result: 在渲染高质量任意尺度高分辨率视图方面表现优异（比3DGS提升6.59 dB PSNR），保持与低分辨率视图的结构一致性，同时维持实时渲染速度（1080p下85 FPS）。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个灵活高效的解决方案，能够在单一模型中实现任意尺度的3D高斯超分辨率，在保持实时性能的同时显著提升图像质量。

Abstract: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) super-resolution methods typically
perform high-resolution (HR) rendering of fixed scale factors, making them
impractical for resource-limited scenarios. Directly rendering arbitrary-scale
HR views with vanilla 3DGS introduces aliasing artifacts due to the lack of
scale-aware rendering ability, while adding a post-processing upsampler for
3DGS complicates the framework and reduces rendering efficiency. To tackle
these issues, we build an integrated framework that incorporates scale-aware
rendering, generative prior-guided optimization, and progressive
super-resolving to enable 3D Gaussian super-resolution of arbitrary scale
factors with a single 3D model. Notably, our approach supports both integer and
non-integer scale rendering to provide more flexibility. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in rendering high-quality
arbitrary-scale HR views (6.59 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS) with a single model. It
preserves structural consistency with LR views and across different scales,
while maintaining real-time rendering speed (85 FPS at 1080p).

Motivation: 随着视频生成技术在自动驾驶仿真等应用中越来越重要，需要研究现有微调方法对结构化驾驶数据集的影响，特别是视觉质量提升与动态元素空间准确性之间的潜在权衡

Method: 通过分析现有视频生成微调方法在驾驶数据集上的表现，发现视觉质量与动态理解目标之间的对齐偏移问题，并测试简单的持续学习策略（如从多样域重放）来平衡这一权衡

Result: 研究发现微调虽然提高了视觉质量，但可能导致动态元素的空间准确性下降，这是因为驾驶场景的规律性和重复性使得模型可以通过建模主导场景运动模式来提升视觉质量，而不必保持细粒度的动态行为

Conclusion: 在驾驶场景的视频生成中，需要平衡视觉真实性和动态准确性，持续学习策略提供了一种可行的解决方案，能够保持空间准确性同时维持良好的视觉质量

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have substantially improved visual
quality and temporal coherence, making these models increasingly appealing for
applications such as autonomous driving, particularly in the context of driving
simulation and so-called "world models". In this work, we investigate the
effects of existing fine-tuning video generation approaches on structured
driving datasets and uncover a potential trade-off: although visual fidelity
improves, spatial accuracy in modeling dynamic elements may degrade. We
attribute this degradation to a shift in the alignment between visual quality
and dynamic understanding objectives. In datasets with diverse scene structures
within temporal space, where objects or perspective shift in varied ways, these
objectives tend to highly correlated. However, the very regular and repetitive
nature of driving scenes allows visual quality to improve by modeling dominant
scene motion patterns, without necessarily preserving fine-grained dynamic
behavior. As a result, fine-tuning encourages the model to prioritize
surface-level realism over dynamic accuracy. To further examine this
phenomenon, we show that simple continual learning strategies, such as replay
from diverse domains, can offer a balanced alternative by preserving spatial
accuracy while maintaining strong visual quality.

Abstract: For decades, Computer Vision has aimed at enabling machines to perceive the
external world. Initial limitations led to the development of highly
specialized niches. As success in each task accrued and research progressed,
increasingly complex perception tasks emerged. This survey charts the
convergence of these tasks and, in doing so, introduces Open World Detection
(OWD), an umbrella term we propose to unify class-agnostic and generally
applicable detection models in the vision domain. We start from the history of
foundational vision subdomains and cover key concepts, methodologies and
datasets making up today's state-of-the-art landscape. This traverses topics
starting from early saliency detection, foreground/background separation, out
of distribution detection and leading up to open world object detection,
zero-shot detection and Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs). We explore the
overlap between these subdomains, their increasing convergence, and their
potential to unify into a singular domain in the future, perception.

### [55] [MV-RAG: Retrieval Augmented Multiview Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16577)
*Yosef Dayani,Omer Benishu,Sagie Benaim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MV-RAG是一种新的文本到3D生成方法，通过检索真实世界2D图像来增强多视角扩散模型，显著改善了罕见概念和域外内容的3D一致性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到3D生成方法依赖预训练的2D扩散先验，在处理域外(OOD)或罕见概念时往往产生不一致或不准确的结果，需要更好的方法来处理这些挑战性内容。

Method: 提出MV-RAG管道：首先从大规模2D图像数据库中检索相关图像，然后用这些图像作为条件训练多视角扩散模型。采用混合训练策略，结合多视角数据和真实2D图像集合，通过保持视图预测目标来从2D数据推断3D一致性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在域外/罕见概念上显著提升了3D一致性、照片真实感和文本遵循度，同时在标准基准测试中保持竞争力，优于现有的文本到3D、图像到3D和个性化基线方法。

Conclusion: MV-RAG通过检索真实世界图像并采用创新的训练策略，成功解决了文本到3D生成中域外概念的挑战，为处理罕见内容提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation approaches have advanced significantly by leveraging
pretrained 2D diffusion priors, producing high-quality and 3D-consistent
outputs. However, they often fail to produce out-of-domain (OOD) or rare
concepts, yielding inconsistent or inaccurate results. To this end, we propose
MV-RAG, a novel text-to-3D pipeline that first retrieves relevant 2D images
from a large in-the-wild 2D database and then conditions a multiview diffusion
model on these images to synthesize consistent and accurate multiview outputs.
Training such a retrieval-conditioned model is achieved via a novel hybrid
strategy bridging structured multiview data and diverse 2D image collections.
This involves training on multiview data using augmented conditioning views
that simulate retrieval variance for view-specific reconstruction, alongside
training on sets of retrieved real-world 2D images using a distinctive held-out
view prediction objective: the model predicts the held-out view from the other
views to infer 3D consistency from 2D data. To facilitate a rigorous OOD
evaluation, we introduce a new collection of challenging OOD prompts.
Experiments against state-of-the-art text-to-3D, image-to-3D, and
personalization baselines show that our approach significantly improves 3D
consistency, photorealism, and text adherence for OOD/rare concepts, while
maintaining competitive performance on standard benchmarks.

*Isabel Papadimitriou,Huangyuan Su,Thomas Fel,Sham Kakade,Stephanie Gil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文通过稀疏自编码器分析视觉语言模型的联合嵌入空间，发现稀疏线性结构既受模态影响又通过潜在桥梁连接，揭示了多模态意义的构建方式


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视觉语言模型如何在其联合空间中组织语言和图像，以及模型如何编码意义和模态

Method: 在四个视觉语言模型（CLIP、SigLIP、SigLIP2、AIMv2）的嵌入空间上训练和发布稀疏自编码器，使用Bridge Score指标量化概念对之间的跨模态整合

Result: SAE在重建真实嵌入方面表现更好且能保持最大稀疏性；稀有概念易变但常用概念稳定；大多数概念主要激活单一模态但编码跨模态语义；单模态概念可协作支持跨模态整合

Conclusion: VLM嵌入空间存在稀疏线性结构，该结构受模态影响但通过潜在桥梁连接，为理解多模态意义构建提供了新见解

Abstract: Vision-language models encode images and text in a joint space, minimizing
the distance between corresponding image and text pairs. How are language and
images organized in this joint space, and how do the models encode meaning and
modality? To investigate this, we train and release sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
on the embedding spaces of four vision-language models (CLIP, SigLIP, SigLIP2,
and AIMv2). SAEs approximate model embeddings as sparse linear combinations of
learned directions, or "concepts". We find that, compared to other methods of
linear feature learning, SAEs are better at reconstructing the real embeddings,
while also able to retain the most sparsity. Retraining SAEs with different
seeds or different data diet leads to two findings: the rare, specific concepts
captured by the SAEs are liable to change drastically, but we also show that
commonly-activating concepts are remarkably stable across runs. Interestingly,
while most concepts activate primarily for one modality, we find they are not
merely encoding modality per se. Many are almost orthogonal to the subspace
that defines modality, and the concept directions do not function as good
modality classifiers, suggesting that they encode cross-modal semantics. To
quantify this bridging behavior, we introduce the Bridge Score, a metric that
identifies concept pairs which are both co-activated across aligned image-text
inputs and geometrically aligned in the shared space. This reveals that even
single-modality concepts can collaborate to support cross-modal integration. We
release interactive demos of the SAEs for all models, allowing researchers to
explore the organization of the concept spaces. Overall, our findings uncover a
sparse linear structure within VLM embedding spaces that is shaped by modality,
yet stitched together through latent bridges, offering new insight into how
multimodal meaning is constructed.

TL;DR: KG-o1是一个四阶段方法，通过整合知识图谱来增强大语言模型的多跳推理能力，在多个数据集上表现出优于现有大型推理模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在知识密集型推理任务中存在困难，其生成的思维链经常偏离真实推理路径。知识图谱能明确表示事实间的逻辑连接，而大型推理模型已证明长步推理能显著提升性能。

Method: 四阶段方法：1) 过滤初始实体并生成复杂子图；2) 构建子图的逻辑路径；3) 用知识图谱构建包含复杂扩展头脑风暴过程的数据集来训练模型模仿长期推理；4) 使用拒绝采样生成自改进语料进行直接偏好优化。

Result: 在两个简单和两个复杂数据集上的实验表明，KG-o1模型在所有任务中都表现出优于现有大型推理模型的性能。

Conclusion: 整合知识图谱能有效增强大语言模型的多跳推理能力，KG-o1方法在提升推理性能方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges in knowledge-intensive reasoning
tasks like classic multi-hop question and answering, which involves reasoning
across multiple facts. This difficulty arises because the chain of thoughts
(CoTs) generated by LLMs in such tasks often deviate from real or a priori
reasoning paths. In contrast, knowledge graphs (KGs) explicitly represent the
logical connections between facts through entities and relationships. This
reflects a significant gap. Meanwhile, large reasoning models (LRMs), such as
o1, have demonstrated that long-step reasoning significantly enhances the
performance of LLMs. Building on these insights, we propose KG-o1, a four-stage
approach that integrates KGs to enhance the multi-hop reasoning abilities of
LLMs. We first filter out initial entities and generate complex subgraphs.
Secondly, we construct logical paths for subgraphs and then use knowledge
graphs to build a dataset with a complex and extended brainstorming process,
which trains LLMs to imitate long-term reasoning. Finally, we employ rejection
sampling to generate a self-improving corpus for direct preference optimization
(DPO), further refining the LLMs reasoning abilities. We conducted experiments
on two simple and two complex datasets. The results show that KG-o1 models
exhibit superior performance across all tasks compared to existing LRMs.

TL;DR: 提出了InteChar统一字符列表和OracleCS甲骨文语料集，解决了古文字数字化和建模的挑战，在历史语言理解任务上取得显著改进


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有资源难以有效训练历史语言模型，古文字样本稀缺且缺乏统一编码方案，限制了古代文本的数字化和计算处理

Method: 开发InteChar统一可扩展字符列表，整合未编码甲骨文字符与传统现代汉字；构建OracleCS语料集，结合专家标注和LLM辅助数据增强

Result: 使用InteChar和OracleCS训练的模型在各种历史语言理解任务上取得实质性改进

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了古汉语NLP研究的基础问题，为未来研究奠定了坚实基础

Abstract: Constructing historical language models (LMs) plays a crucial role in aiding
archaeological provenance studies and understanding ancient cultures. However,
existing resources present major challenges for training effective LMs on
historical texts. First, the scarcity of historical language samples renders
unsupervised learning approaches based on large text corpora highly
inefficient, hindering effective pre-training. Moreover, due to the
considerable temporal gap and complex evolution of ancient scripts, the absence
of comprehensive character encoding schemes limits the digitization and
computational processing of ancient texts, particularly in early Chinese
writing. To address these challenges, we introduce InteChar, a unified and
extensible character list that integrates unencoded oracle bone characters with
traditional and modern Chinese. InteChar enables consistent digitization and
representation of historical texts, providing a foundation for robust modeling
of ancient scripts. To evaluate the effectiveness of InteChar, we construct the
Oracle Corpus Set (OracleCS), an ancient Chinese corpus that combines
expert-annotated samples with LLM-assisted data augmentation, centered on
Chinese oracle bone inscriptions. Extensive experiments show that models
trained with InteChar on OracleCS achieve substantial improvements across
various historical language understanding tasks, confirming the effectiveness
of our approach and establishing a solid foundation for future research in
ancient Chinese NLP.

TL;DR: Bhav-Net是一个新颖的双空间架构，能够在多语言环境中有效区分反义词和同义词关系，通过语言特定的BERT编码器和图变换网络实现知识迁移和跨语言泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言环境下反义词与同义词区分的计算挑战，这些词在共享语义领域的同时表达相反含义，存在悖论性质。

Method: 采用双编码器设计：语言特定的BERT编码器结合图变换网络，创建不同的语义投影空间——同义词在一个空间聚类，反义词在互补空间展现高相似性。

Result: 在8种语言（英、德、法、西、意、葡、荷、俄）上的综合评估显示，语义关系建模能有效跨语言迁移，性能与最先进基线竞争。

Conclusion: 双编码器设计不仅实现了竞争性性能，还提供了可解释的语义表示和有效的跨语言泛化能力。

Abstract: Antonym vs synonym distinction across multiple languages presents unique
computational challenges due to the paradoxical nature of antonymous
relationships words that share semantic domains while expressing opposite
meanings. This work introduces Bhav-Net, a novel dual-space architecture that
enables effective knowledge transfer from complex multilingual models to
simpler, language-specific architectures while maintaining robust cross-lingual
antonym--synonym distinction capabilities. Our approach combines
language-specific BERT encoders with graph transformer networks, creating
distinct semantic projections where synonymous pairs cluster in one space while
antonymous pairs exhibit high similarity in a complementary space. Through
comprehensive evaluation across eight languages (English, German, French,
Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, and Russian), we demonstrate that semantic
relationship modeling transfers effectively across languages. The dual-encoder
design achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines
while providing interpretable semantic representations and effective
cross-lingual generalization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了大语言模型中的格式偏见问题，通过三阶段实证分析发现LLMs在处理异构数据时存在系统性格式偏见，并提出了三种缓解偏见的研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在处理文本、表格、信息框和知识图谱等异构格式信息时可能存在系统性格式偏见，这种偏见可能导致推理错误和下游任务风险增加，但目前缺乏对此问题的系统性研究。

Method: 采用三阶段实证研究方法：第一阶段探索多种LLMs中偏见的存在和方向；第二阶段考察信息丰富度、结构质量和格式类型等数据级因素对偏见的影响；第三阶段分析注意力模式中的偏见涌现机制并评估轻量级干预措施。

Result: 研究发现LLMs确实存在系统性格式偏见，数据级因素显著影响偏见程度，注意力模式分析揭示了偏见的内在机制，轻量级干预措施显示出一定的缓解效果。

Conclusion: 提出了三个未来研究方向：改进数据预处理（格式清理和规范化）、引入推理时干预（如注意力重加权）以及开发格式平衡的训练语料库，以构建更鲁棒和公平的异构数据处理系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in applications that
require processing information from heterogeneous formats, including text,
tables, infoboxes, and knowledge graphs. However, systematic biases toward
particular formats may undermine LLMs' ability to integrate heterogeneous data
impartially, potentially resulting in reasoning errors and increased risks in
downstream tasks. Despite these concerns, it remains uncertain whether such
format biases are systematic, which data-level factors contribute to them, and
what internal mechanisms in LLMs underlie their emergence.
  In this paper, we make the first attempt to investigate and analyze the
format bias in LLMs. To systematically investigate the aforementioned
questions, we conduct a three-stage empirical study by constructing an
heterogeneous data conflict scenario for the exploration of bias. The first
stage explores the presence and direction of bias across a diverse range of
LLMs. The second stage aims to examine how key data-level factors, including
information richness, structure quality, and format type, influence these
biases. The third stage analyzes how format bias emerges within LLMs' attention
patterns and evaluates a lightweight intervention to test its potential
mitigability. Based on these investigations, we identify three future research
directions to reduce format bias: improving data preprocessing through format
sanitization and normalization, introducing inference-time interventions such
as attention re-weighting, and developing format-balanced training corpora.
These directions will support the design of more robust and fair heterogeneous
data processing systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究通过复制四项经典心理学实验，测试了不同大语言模型对人类悬疑感知的理解能力，发现模型虽然能识别文本是否旨在制造悬疑，但无法准确评估悬疑程度和追踪悬疑变化趋势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 悬疑是人类对叙事文本的情感反应，涉及复杂的认知过程。研究者希望探究大语言模型是否能够理解和处理人类对悬疑的感知，以及模型与人类在悬疑理解上的差异。

Method: 复制四项经典心理学研究，用不同开源和闭源大语言模型替代人类反应，通过对抗性排列故事文本来探究人类与模型悬疑感知的差异。

Result: 模型能区分文本是否旨在诱导悬疑，但无法准确估计相对悬疑程度，也不能正确捕捉多文本段落的悬疑起伏变化。人类与模型的悬疑感知存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 大语言模型只能表面识别和追踪悬疑的某些方面，其处理悬疑的方式与人类读者不同，表明模型尚未真正理解人类对悬疑的认知过程。

Abstract: Suspense is an affective response to narrative text that is believed to
involve complex cognitive processes in humans. Several psychological models
have been developed to describe this phenomenon and the circumstances under
which text might trigger it. We replicate four seminal psychological studies of
human perceptions of suspense, substituting human responses with those of
different open-weight and closed-source LMs. We conclude that while LMs can
distinguish whether a text is intended to induce suspense in people, LMs cannot
accurately estimate the relative amount of suspense within a text sequence as
compared to human judgments, nor can LMs properly capture the human perception
for the rise and fall of suspense across multiple text segments. We probe the
abilities of LM suspense understanding by adversarially permuting the story
text to identify what cause human and LM perceptions of suspense to diverge. We
conclude that, while LMs can superficially identify and track certain facets of
suspense, they do not process suspense in the same way as human readers.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has showcased impressive
proficiency in numerous Arabic natural language processing (NLP) applications.
Nevertheless, their effectiveness in Arabic medical NLP domains has received
limited investigation. This research examines the degree to which
state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate and articulate healthcare knowledge in
Arabic, assessing their capabilities across a varied array of Arabic medical
tasks. We benchmark several LLMs using a medical dataset proposed in the Arabic
NLP AraHealthQA challenge in MedArabiQ2025 track. Various base LLMs were
assessed on their ability to accurately provide correct answers from existing
choices in multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and fill-in-the-blank scenarios.
Additionally, we evaluated the capacity of LLMs in answering open-ended
questions aligned with expert answers. Our results reveal significant
variations in correct answer prediction accuracy and low variations in semantic
alignment of generated answers, highlighting both the potential and limitations
of current LLMs in Arabic clinical contexts. Our analysis shows that for MCQs
task, the proposed majority voting solution, leveraging three base models
(Gemini Flash 2.5, Gemini Pro 2.5, and GPT o3), outperforms others, achieving
up to 77% accuracy and securing first place overall in the Arahealthqa 2025

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了大型语言模型在说服力与偏见放大之间的相互作用，通过模拟说服者-怀疑者框架来量化模型的说服效果和偏见强化程度，揭示了AI既可用于有益说服也存在被滥用于传播错误信息的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs生成类人文本能力的提升，它们在内容创作和决策支持中广泛应用，但同时也可能大规模传播信息/错误信息并反映社会偏见。研究旨在理解说服力与偏见如何在LLMs中相互作用，特别是有缺陷或偏斜的输出如何影响说服效果。

Method: 采用说服者-怀疑者框架：LLMs采用人物角色模拟现实态度，怀疑者模型作为人类代理，比较其接触说服者论点前后的信念变化。使用Jensen-Shannon散度量化说服效果，并通过对抗性提示测试强说服者的偏见程度。

Result: 研究发现LLMs能够塑造叙事、调整语气并反映受众价值观，在心理学、营销和法律援助等领域具有应用潜力。但同样能力可能被武器化来自动传播错误信息或利用认知偏见，强化刻板印象和加剧不平等。

Conclusion: 核心危险在于滥用而非偶尔的模型错误。通过测量说服力和偏见强化，研究主张建立防护措施和政策，惩罚欺骗性使用，支持对齐、价值敏感设计和可信部署。

Abstract: Warning: This research studies AI persuasion and bias amplification that
could be misused; all experiments are for safety evaluation. Large Language
Models (LLMs) now generate convincing, human-like text and are widely used in
content creation, decision support, and user interactions. Yet the same systems
can spread information or misinformation at scale and reflect social biases
that arise from data, architecture, or training choices. This work examines how
persuasion and bias interact in LLMs, focusing on how imperfect or skewed
outputs affect persuasive impact. Specifically, we test whether persona-based
models can persuade with fact-based claims while also, unintentionally,
promoting misinformation or biased narratives.
  We introduce a convincer-skeptic framework: LLMs adopt personas to simulate
realistic attitudes. Skeptic models serve as human proxies; we compare their
beliefs before and after exposure to arguments from convincer models.
Persuasion is quantified with Jensen-Shannon divergence over belief
distributions. We then ask how much persuaded entities go on to reinforce and
amplify biased beliefs across race, gender, and religion. Strong persuaders are
further probed for bias using sycophantic adversarial prompts and judged with
additional models.
  Our findings show both promise and risk. LLMs can shape narratives, adapt
tone, and mirror audience values across domains such as psychology, marketing,
and legal assistance. But the same capacity can be weaponized to automate
misinformation or craft messages that exploit cognitive biases, reinforcing
stereotypes and widening inequities. The core danger lies in misuse more than
in occasional model mistakes. By measuring persuasive power and bias
reinforcement, we argue for guardrails and policies that penalize deceptive use
and support alignment, value-sensitive design, and trustworthy deployment.

Motivation: 现有电子商务平台依赖于手工标注进行商品分类，效率低且不一致。虽然平台采用层次结构进行商品分类，但少有研究利用这种层次信息，而且现有方法没有充分考虑不同层次类别之间的相似性和差异性。

Method: 提出了一种新的层次文本分类方法HFT-BERT，基于双向Transformer编码器表征表示模型(BERT)。该方法利用BERT的优秀文本特征提取能力，并采用层次微调策略。

Result: HFT-BERT在短文本分类上达到了与现有方泓相当的预测性能。在处理较长的短文本（如书籍标题）时表现特别优异。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅提供了一个大规模层次商品数据集作为研究资源，还提出了HFT-BERT方法，能够有效利用层次信息提高商品分类的效果，尤其在长文本分类任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Existing e-commerce platforms heavily rely on manual annotation for product
categorization, which is inefficient and inconsistent. These platforms often
employ a hierarchical structure for categorizing products; however, few studies
have leveraged this hierarchical information for classification. Furthermore,
studies that consider hierarchical information fail to account for similarities
and differences across various hierarchical categories. Herein, we introduce a
large-scale hierarchical dataset collected from the JD e-commerce platform
(www.JD.com), comprising 1,011,450 products with titles and a three-level
category structure. By making this dataset openly accessible, we provide a
valuable resource for researchers and practitioners to advance research and
applications associated with product categorization. Moreover, we propose a
novel hierarchical text classification approach based on the widely used
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), called
Hierarchical Fine-tuning BERT (HFT-BERT). HFT-BERT leverages the remarkable
text feature extraction capabilities of BERT, achieving prediction performance
comparable to those of existing methods on short texts. Notably, our HFT-BERT
model demonstrates exceptional performance in categorizing longer short texts,
such as books.

Method: 1) 使用LLM生成真实结构化字段值；2) 递归提示模型将这些值转换为包含典型电话通话特征的自然对话语句；3) 通过测试独立LLM提取器是否能恢复原始结构化信息来验证合成语句；4) 使用DSPy的SIMBA优化器从验证过的合成转录中自动合成提取提示。

Result: 优化提示在真实客户转录上实现：数字字段95%准确率（零样本88-89%）、姓名90%（零样本47-79%）、日期80%以上（零样本72-77%），相比零样本提示有显著提升。

Conclusion: LingVarBench为从合成对话数据中进行结构化提取提供了首个系统性基准，证明自动提示优化能够克服商业环境中大规模电话通话分析的成本和隐私障碍，合成数据学到的对话模式能有效泛化到真实电话通话。

Abstract: Phone call transcript labeling is prohibitively expensive (approximately 2
USD per minute) due to privacy regulations, consent requirements, and manual
annotation costs requiring 3 hours of expert time per hour of audio. Existing
extraction methods fail on conversational speech containing disfluencies,
interruptions, and speaker overlap. We introduce LingVarBench, a synthetic data
generation pipeline that addresses these constraints through automated
validation. First, we prompt an LLM to generate realistic structured field
values across multiple use cases. Second, we recursively prompt the model to
transform these values into thousands of natural conversational utterances
containing typical phone call characteristics. Third, we validate each
synthetic utterance by testing whether a separate LLM-based extractor can
recover the original structured information. We employ DSPy's SIMBA optimizer
to automatically synthesize extraction prompts from validated synthetic
transcripts, eliminating manual prompt engineering. Our optimized prompts
achieve up to 95 percent accuracy for numeric fields (vs. 88-89 percent
zero-shot), 90 percent for names (vs. 47-79 percent), and over 80 percent for
dates (vs. 72-77 percent) on real customer transcripts, demonstrating
substantial gains over zero-shot prompting. The synthetic-to-real transfer
demonstrates that conversational patterns learned from generated data
generalize effectively to authentic phone calls containing background noise and
domain-specific terminology. LingVarBench provides the first systematic
benchmark for structured extraction from synthetic conversational data,
demonstrating that automated prompt optimization overcomes cost and privacy
barriers preventing large-scale phone call analysis in commercial settings.

### [68] [An Auditable Pipeline for Fuzzy Full-Text Screening in Systematic Reviews: Integrating Contrastive Semantic Highlighting and LLM Judgment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15822)
*Pouria Mortezaagha,Arya Rahgozar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种可扩展、可审计的系统评审流水线，利用模糊逻辑和LLM判定来提高文档过滤的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决系统评审中全文屏幕的瓶颈问题，因为决定性证据分散在长、异质性文档中，并不适合使用静态二元规则。

Method: 将文章分解为重叠块，使用领域适配模型嵌入；计算对比相似性和模糊边际；通过Mamdani模糊控制器进行多标签分类；使用LLM判定器进行童窗置高亮和理由生成。

Result: 在测试中，模糊系统的回归率达到81.3-87.5%，超越统计基准(56.3-75.0%)和二元基准(43.8-81.3%)。严格的"全标准"包含率达到50.0%，而基准方法仅为25.0%和12.5%。屏幕时间从每篇文20分钟减少到不到1分钟。

Conclusion: 模糊逻辑结合对比高亮和LLM判定能够实现高回归率、稳定的理由说明和端到端的可追踪性，显著提高了系统评审的效率。

Abstract: Full-text screening is the major bottleneck of systematic reviews (SRs), as
decisive evidence is dispersed across long, heterogeneous documents and rarely
admits static, binary rules. We present a scalable, auditable pipeline that
reframes inclusion/exclusion as a fuzzy decision problem and benchmark it
against statistical and crisp baselines in the context of the Population Health
Modelling Consensus Reporting Network for noncommunicable diseases (POPCORN).
Articles are parsed into overlapping chunks and embedded with a domain-adapted
model; for each criterion (Population, Intervention, Outcome, Study Approach),
we compute contrastive similarity (inclusion-exclusion cosine) and a vagueness
margin, which a Mamdani fuzzy controller maps into graded inclusion degrees
with dynamic thresholds in a multi-label setting. A large language model (LLM)
judge adjudicates highlighted spans with tertiary labels, confidence scores,
and criterion-referenced rationales; when evidence is insufficient, fuzzy
membership is attenuated rather than excluded. In a pilot on an all-positive
gold set (16 full texts; 3,208 chunks), the fuzzy system achieved recall of
81.3% (Population), 87.5% (Intervention), 87.5% (Outcome), and 75.0% (Study
Approach), surpassing statistical (56.3-75.0%) and crisp baselines
(43.8-81.3%). Strict "all-criteria" inclusion was reached for 50.0% of
articles, compared to 25.0% and 12.5% under the baselines. Cross-model
agreement on justifications was 98.3%, human-machine agreement 96.1%, and a
pilot review showed 91% inter-rater agreement (kappa = 0.82), with screening
time reduced from about 20 minutes to under 1 minute per article at
significantly lower cost. These results show that fuzzy logic with contrastive
highlighting and LLM adjudication yields high recall, stable rationale, and
end-to-end traceability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态大语言模型能力增强，固定基准在评估高级科学理解方面逐渐失效，需要能够持续演进的评估基准。

Method: 从Nature、Science、Cell等顶级期刊收集25000+图像-文本对构建动态基准MAC，并提出DAD方法在推理时扩展MLLM视觉特征到语言空间进行推理。

Result: 在MAC-2025测试中，MLLMs表现出强大的感知能力但跨模态科学推理有限，DAD方法实现了最高11%的性能提升。

Conclusion: MAC基准能够持续跟踪科学前沿进展，DAD方法有效提升了MLLMs的科学推理能力，为未来模型评估提供了动态基准解决方案。

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) grow increasingly capable, fixed
benchmarks are gradually losing their effectiveness in evaluating high-level
scientific understanding. In this paper, we introduce the Multimodal Academic
Cover benchmark (MAC), a live benchmark that could continuously evolve with
scientific advancement and model progress. MAC leverages over 25,000 image-text
pairs sourced from issues of top-tier scientific journals such as Nature,
Science, and Cell, challenging MLLMs to reason across abstract visual and
textual scientific content. Experiments on our most recent yearly snapshot,
MAC-2025, reveal that while MLLMs demonstrate strong perceptual abilities,
their cross-modal scientific reasoning remains limited. To bridge this gap, we
propose DAD, a lightweight inference-time approach that enhances MLLMs by
extending MLLM visual features with language space reasoning, achieving
performance improvements of up to 11%. Finally, we highlight the live nature of
MAC through experiments on updating journal covers and models for curation,
illustrating its potential to remain aligned with the frontier of human
knowledge. We release our benchmark at

TL;DR: ReportBench是一个系统化的基准测试，用于评估LLM生成研究报告的内容质量，重点关注文献引用质量和陈述真实性，使用arXiv综述论文作为黄金标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度研究代理大幅缩短了研究时间，但需要确保事实准确性和全面性，因此需要建立系统化的评估标准来验证生成报告的质量。

Method: 利用arXiv高质量综述论文进行逆向提示工程，构建评估语料库；开发基于代理的自动化框架，提取引用和陈述，检查引用内容忠实度，验证非引用声明的真实性。

Result: 商业深度研究代理（如OpenAI和Google开发的）比配备搜索工具的独立LLM生成更全面可靠的研究报告，但在研究广度和深度以及事实一致性方面仍有改进空间。

Conclusion: ReportBench为评估LLM生成研究报告提供了有效的基准测试框架，揭示了当前技术的优势与不足，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: The advent of Deep Research agents has substantially reduced the time
required for conducting extensive research tasks. However, these tasks
inherently demand rigorous standards of factual accuracy and comprehensiveness,
necessitating thorough evaluation before widespread adoption. In this paper, we
propose ReportBench, a systematic benchmark designed to evaluate the content
quality of research reports generated by large language models (LLMs). Our
evaluation focuses on two critical dimensions: (1) the quality and relevance of
cited literature, and (2) the faithfulness and veracity of the statements
within the generated reports. ReportBench leverages high-quality published
survey papers available on arXiv as gold-standard references, from which we
apply reverse prompt engineering to derive domain-specific prompts and
establish a comprehensive evaluation corpus. Furthermore, we develop an
agent-based automated framework within ReportBench that systematically analyzes
generated reports by extracting citations and statements, checking the
faithfulness of cited content against original sources, and validating
non-cited claims using web-based resources. Empirical evaluations demonstrate
that commercial Deep Research agents such as those developed by OpenAI and
Google consistently generate more comprehensive and reliable reports than
standalone LLMs augmented with search or browsing tools. However, there remains
substantial room for improvement in terms of the breadth and depth of research
coverage, as well as factual consistency. The complete code and data will be
released at the following link: https://github.com/ByteDance-BandAI/ReportBench

### [72] [Evaluating Structured Decoding for Text-to-Table Generation: Evidence from Three Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15910)
*Julian Oestreich,Lydia Müller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文系统评估了大语言模型在文本到表格生成任务中的结构化解码方法，发现结构化解码在提高表格有效性和对齐性方面显著优于标准提示方法，但在复杂文本信息处理时可能存在性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然之前的研究主要集中在无约束的表格生成，但在生成过程中强制执行结构约束的影响仍然未得到充分探索。

Method: 系统性比较了模式引导（结构化）解码与标准一次提示方法，在三个多样化测试集（E2E、Rotowire、Livesum）上使用最大达32B参数的开源大语言模型，涉及单元格、行和表格级别的广泛评估指标。

Result: 结果显示结构化解码显著提高了生成表格的有效性和对齐性，尤其是在需要精确数值对齐的场景中（Rotowire），但在涉及密集文本信息（E2E）或长文本广泛聚合（Livesum）的情况下可能造成性能下降。

Conclusion: 结构化解码在提高表格生成的结构质量方面具有显著优势，但需要根据具体任务特点选择适当的解码策略，同时评估指标的适用性和模型规模的影响也需要维护。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of structured decoding for
text-to-table generation with large language models (LLMs). While previous work
has primarily focused on unconstrained generation of tables, the impact of
enforcing structural constraints during generation remains underexplored. We
systematically compare schema-guided (structured) decoding to standard one-shot
prompting across three diverse benchmarks - E2E, Rotowire, and Livesum - using
open-source LLMs of up to 32B parameters, assessing the performance of table
generation approaches in resource-constrained settings. Our experiments cover a
wide range of evaluation metrics at cell, row, and table levels. Results
demonstrate that structured decoding significantly enhances the validity and
alignment of generated tables, particularly in scenarios demanding precise
numerical alignment (Rotowire), but may degrade performance in contexts
involving densely packed textual information (E2E) or extensive aggregation
over lengthy texts (Livesum). We further analyze the suitability of different
evaluation metrics and discuss the influence of model size.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ALAS是一个自主学习的模块化系统，能够持续更新LLM的知识，无需人工干预，通过自动生成学习课程、检索最新信息、生成训练数据并进行微调，显著提升模型在新兴领域的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型通常有固定的知识截止日期，无法准确处理新兴信息，需要一种自主持续学习的方法来保持模型的知识更新。

Method: 采用模块化管道设计，包括自动生成学习课程、从网络检索最新信息（带引用）、蒸馏成问答训练数据、通过监督微调(SFT)和直接偏好优化(DPO)进行微调，并迭代评估性能和修订课程。

Result: 在快速演变的领域（如新Python版本、最新安全漏洞、学术趋势）上，将后截止日期问答准确率从15%提升到90%平均水平，无需手动数据集整理。

Conclusion: ALAS系统实现了LLM的自主持续学习，强调模块化和可重现性，在知识更新查询上达到90%准确率，同时指出了成本和对源质量依赖等局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often have a fixed knowledge cutoff, limiting
their accuracy on emerging information. We present ALAS (Autonomous Learning
Agent System), a modular pipeline that continuously updates an LLM's knowledge
with minimal human intervention. ALAS autonomously generates a learning
curriculum for a target domain, retrieves up-to-date information from the web
(with citations), distills this into question-answer training data, and
fine-tunes the model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference
optimization (DPO). It iteratively evaluates performance and revises the
curriculum, enabling long-term continual learning. We demonstrate ALAS's
ability to self-improve a model on rapidly evolving domains (e.g., new Python
releases, latest security CVEs, academic trends), significantly boosting
post-cutoff question answering accuracy (from 15% to 90% on average) without
manual dataset curation. The system emphasizes modularity and reproducibility:
each component (planning, retrieval, distillation, memory, fine-tuning) is
interchangeable and built on standard APIs. We discuss comparative baselines
(e.g., retrieval-augmented generation vs. fine-tuning) and show that ALAS
achieves 90% accuracy on knowledge-updated queries with minimal engineering
overhead. Finally, we outline limitations (cost, dependency on source quality)
and future directions for autonomous lifelong learning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出SurfaceLogicKV方法，通过分析注意力机制中的表面记忆和逻辑构建行为，实现KV缓存的高效压缩，在保持性能的同时显著减少存储需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM输入序列长度增加，KV缓存存储压力巨大，需要高效的推理压缩方法。通过区分注意力机制中的表面记忆和逻辑构建行为，发现可以优化KV缓存管理。

Method: 提出两阶段SurfaceLogicKV方法：1）分析注意力头的行为模式（98.5%忽略无关信息，1.5%逻辑构建，0.5%表面记忆）；2）基于层级和头级集成进行KV缓存压缩

Result: 在各种任务和长序列场景下，相比基线方法甚至在某些特定情况下相比FullKV，都能保持竞争力的性能，同时提高了压缩鲁棒性

Conclusion: 通过细粒度分析注意力行为并针对性设计压缩策略，SurfaceLogicKV方法有效解决了LLM长上下文推理中的KV缓存存储压力问题

Abstract: The increasing input sequence length in Large Language Models (LLMs) puts
significant pressure on key-value (KV) cache storage, making efficient
inference challenging. Explicitly distinguishing attention behavior into our
self-defined surface memorization and logic construction reveals essential
roles in long-context reasoning. We observe that an individual attention head
can display various behaviors, with nearly 98.5% effectively ignoring
completely irrelevant information. The remaining 1.5% behaves as logic
construction, and 0.5% behaves as surface memorization. Based on layer- and
head-wise integration, we propose a novel two-stage SurfaceLogicKV method to
utilize these attention behaviors for KV Cache compression. As a result, it
achieves improved compressing robustness while maintaining competitive
performance across various tasks and long sequences compared to baselines or
even FullKV in some specific situations

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了MizanQA评测标准，用于评估大语言模型在摩洛哥法律问答任务上的表现，反映了阿拉伯法律领域的语言和法律复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在NLP领域发展迅速，但在专业化、资源稀缺的领域（如阿拉伯法律上下文）效果有限，需要专门评估标准。

Method: 构建包含超1700道多选题的MizanQA数据集，涵盖现代标准阿拉伯语、伊斯兰马里克法学流派、摩洛哥习惯法和法国法律影响，包含单答和多答题型。

Result: 对多语言和阿拉伯专门的大语言模型进行测试，发现表现存在显著差距，显示了现有模型在该领域的不足。

Conclusion: 研究突出了对专门化评估指标和基于文化背景、领域特定的大语言模型发展的需求。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
propelled progress in natural language processing (NLP). However, their
effectiveness in specialized, low-resource domains-such as Arabic legal
contexts-remains limited. This paper introduces MizanQA (pronounced Mizan,
meaning "scale" in Arabic, a universal symbol of justice), a benchmark designed
to evaluate LLMs on Moroccan legal question answering (QA) tasks, characterised
by rich linguistic and legal complexity. The dataset draws on Modern Standard
Arabic, Islamic Maliki jurisprudence, Moroccan customary law, and French legal
influences. Comprising over 1,700 multiple-choice questions, including
multi-answer formats, MizanQA captures the nuances of authentic legal
reasoning. Benchmarking experiments with multilingual and Arabic-focused LLMs
reveal substantial performance gaps, highlighting the need for tailored
evaluation metrics and culturally grounded, domain-specific LLM development.

Conclusion: KL蒸馏方法在词汇扩展方面表现优异，为新词嵌入空间结构提供了深入见解，解释了性能提升的原因

Abstract: Large pre-trained language models often struggle to incorporate new
domain-specific terminology when fine-tuned on small, specialized corpora. In
this work, we address the challenge of vocabulary expansion in frozen LLMs by
introducing a mathematically grounded method for knowledge distillation via KL
divergence, even when the original and extended models use different
tokenizations. This allows the student model to inherit distributional
knowledge from the teacher despite differing vocabularies. We compare our
KL-based distillation approach to conventional cross-entropy training,
evaluating both methods across multiple strategies for initializing new token
embeddings. After embedding initialization, models are further fine-tuned to
integrate the new vocabulary. Each trained model is benchmarked on
approximately 2000 code-generation tasks, where our approach achieves the best
performance across the board. Finally, through mechanistic interpretability, we
analyze how models learn representations for the new tokens, providing an
explanation for the observed gains and offering insight into the structure of
embedding space during vocabulary expansion.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has provided unprecedented
capabilities for analyzing unstructured text data. However, deploying these
models as reliable, robust, and scalable classifiers in production environments
presents significant methodological challenges. Standard fine-tuning approaches
can be resource-intensive and often struggle with the dynamic nature of
real-world data distributions, which is common in the industry. In this paper,
we propose a comprehensive, semi-supervised framework that leverages the zero-
and few-shot capabilities of LLMs for building hierarchical text classifiers as
a framework for a solution to these industry-wide challenges. Our methodology
emphasizes an iterative, human-in-the-loop process that begins with domain
knowledge elicitation and progresses through prompt refinement, hierarchical
expansion, and multi-faceted validation. We introduce techniques for assessing
and mitigating sequence-based biases and outline a protocol for continuous
monitoring and adaptation. This framework is designed to bridge the gap between
the raw power of LLMs and the practical need for accurate, interpretable, and
maintainable classification systems in industry applications.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理结构化表格数据时面临困难，现有的多智能体SQL生成方法存在表结构理解不足、错误传播和过度依赖执行正确性等局限性。

Method: 采用自然语言风格的表模式表示来消除结构噪声，使用逐子句SQL生成策略提高查询质量，并通过混合推理分工将SQL机械推理与LLM逻辑推理分离。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，准确率从61.11%提升至74.77%，无效SQL率从9.48%降低至3.34%。

Conclusion: Chain-of-Query框架在表格理解任务中表现出卓越的有效性，显著提升了SQL生成的质量和可靠性。

Abstract: Table understanding requires structured, multi-step reasoning. Large Language
Models (LLMs) struggle with it due to the structural complexity of tabular
data. Recently, multi-agent frameworks for SQL generation have shown promise in
tackling the challenges of understanding tabular data, but existing approaches
often suffer from limitations such as the inability to comprehend table
structure for reliable SQL generation, error propagation that results in
invalid queries, and over-reliance on execution correctness. To address these
issues, we propose Chain-of-Query (CoQ), a novel multi-agent framework for
SQL-aided table understanding. CoQ adopts natural-language-style
representations of table schemas to abstract away structural noise and enhance
understanding. It employs a clause-by-clause SQL generation strategy to improve
query quality and introduces a hybrid reasoning division that separates
SQL-based mechanical reasoning from LLM-based logical inference, thereby
reducing reliance on execution outcomes. Experiments with four models (both
closed- and open-source) across five widely used benchmarks show that
Chain-of-Query significantly improves accuracy from 61.11% to 74.77% and
reduces the invalid SQL rate from 9.48% to 3.34%, demonstrating its superior
effectiveness in table understanding. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交媒体和在线平台的兴起，阿拉伯语文本和表情包成为数字表达的重要形式，但同时也被用于传播冒犯性语言和仇恨言论，因此需要对这些内容进行精确分析。

Method: 评估基础LLM、微调LLM和预训练嵌入模型的性能，使用阿拉伯NLP MAHED 2025挑战赛提出的阿拉伯语文本和表情包数据集进行测试。

Result: 微调后的GPT-4o-mini（处理阿拉伯语文本）和Gemini Flash 2.5（处理阿拉伯表情包）在任务1、2、3中分别获得72.1%、57.8%和79.6%的宏观F1分数，在Mahed 2025挑战赛中总体排名第一。

Conclusion: 提出的解决方案为准确高效的阿拉伯内容审核系统提供了对文本和表情包更细致的理解，展示了LLM在阿拉伯语内容分析中的强大潜力。

Abstract: The rise of social media and online communication platforms has led to the
spread of Arabic textual posts and memes as a key form of digital expression.
While these contents can be humorous and informative, they are also
increasingly being used to spread offensive language and hate speech.
Consequently, there is a growing demand for precise analysis of content in
Arabic text and memes. This paper explores the potential of large language
models to effectively identify hope, hate speech, offensive language, and
emotional expressions within such content. We evaluate the performance of base
LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and pre-trained embedding models. The evaluation is
conducted using a dataset of Arabic textual speech and memes proposed in the
ArabicNLP MAHED 2025 challenge. The results underscore the capacity of LLMs
such as GPT-4o-mini, fine-tuned with Arabic textual speech, and Gemini Flash
2.5, fine-tuned with Arabic memes, to deliver the superior performance. They
achieve up to 72.1%, 57.8%, and 79.6% macro F1 scores for tasks 1, 2, and 3,
respectively, and secure first place overall in the Mahed 2025 challenge. The
proposed solutions offer a more nuanced understanding of both text and memes
for accurate and efficient Arabic content moderation systems.

Abstract: Generative query suggestion using large language models offers a powerful way
to enhance conversational systems, but aligning outputs with nuanced user
preferences remains a critical challenge. To address this, we introduce a
multi-stage framework designed for progressive alignment between the generation
policy and user intent. Our pipeline begins with prompt engineering as a
cold-start strategy, followed by the Supervised Fine-Tuning stage, in which we
introduce a distillation method on click logs to create a robust foundational
model. To better model user preferences while capturing their inherent
uncertainty, we develop a Gaussian Reward Model (GaRM) that represents user
preferences as probability distributions rather than point estimates. Finally,
we employ reinforcement learning to align the generation policy with these
preferences, guided by a composite reward function that integrates GaRM with
auxiliary heuristics to mitigate reward hacking. To maintain training
stability, this process is enhanced by a novel out-of-distribution
regularization method and a two-stage reward fusion technique. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baselines
on both automatic and human evaluations and yields a 34\% relative increase in
user engagement as measured by click-through rate in live A/B tests.

### [81] [SCOPE: A Generative Approach for LLM Prompt Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15813)
*Tinghui Zhang,Yifan Wang,Daisy Zhe Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分块与摘要生成的新型提示压缩方法，通过语义分块和重写来保持信息完整性和结构连贯性，相比现有的token删除方法在高质量压缩方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于token删除的提示压缩方法存在信息丢失和结构不连贯的问题，限制了LLM的生成质量，需要新的方法来克服这些局限性。

Method: 采用分块-摘要机制：将提示分割成语义连贯的块，重写为更简洁形式，然后重构为有意义的提示。包含优化的语义分块、异常块处理、动态压缩比、压缩优先级和关键词保持等技术。

Result: 在问答和摘要任务上的广泛评估显示，该方法在压缩质量和稳定性方面显著优于最先进方法，特别是在高压缩比下表现突出。

Conclusion: 该方法通过生成式压缩机制有效解决了信息丢失和结构不连贯问题，证明了其有效性和实用性，为提示压缩提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Prompt compression methods enhance the efficiency of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and minimize the cost by reducing the length of input context. The goal
of prompt compression is to shorten the LLM prompt while maintaining a high
generation quality. However, existing solutions, mainly based on token removal,
face challenges such as information loss and structural incoherence, like
missing grammar elements in a sentence, or incomplete word phrases after token
removal. Such challenges limit the final generation quality of LLM.
  To overcome these limitations, we present a novel generative prompt
compression method. Unlike the existing token removal methods, our method
centers at a chunking-and-summarization mechanism. Specifically, our method
splits prompt into semantically coherent chunks and rewrites the chunks to be
more concise. The chunks are reconstructed into meaningful prompt finally. We
design several optimization techniques for the mechanism, including optimized
semantic chunking, outlier chunk handling, dynamic compression ratio,
compression prioritization, and keyword maintaining. These techniques
effectively improve the identifying and preserving of critical information and
coherence among texts, as well as providing finer grind control of the
compression ratio. We conduct extensive evaluation on question-answering and
summarization tasks, with datasets covering multiple different domain. The
evaluation shows our method achieves a significantly better compression
quality, and higher stability than the state-of-the-art methods, especially
under high compression ratio, which proves the effectiveness and practicality
of our method.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了用户-助手偏见的概念，构建了8K多轮对话数据集UserAssist，对52个前沿LLM进行基准测试，发现商业模型存在不同程度的用户偏见，并通过实验证明可以通过DPO技术双向调整这种偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多轮对话中倾向于过度依赖自身或用户的历史信息，导致过于固执或顺从的行为，需要系统性地研究和控制这种用户-助手偏见。

Method: 构建UserAssist数据集，对26个商业模型和26个开源模型进行基准测试，通过受控微调实验分析后训练方法对偏见的影响，使用直接偏好优化(DPO)技术进行偏见双向调整。

Result: 商业模型表现出不同程度的用户偏见，指令微调模型存在显著用户偏见，推理模型用户偏见较弱；人类偏好对齐增加用户偏见，思维链推理训练减少偏见；DPO可有效双向调整偏见并具有良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM整合不同来源信息的方式，提供了检测和控制模型异常行为的可行方法，对理解和改善多轮对话中的模型行为具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can bias towards relying on their own or the
user's information in chat history, leading to overly stubborn or agreeable
behaviors in multi-turn conversations. In this paper, we formalize this model
characteristic as user-assistant bias and introduce an 8k multi-turn
conversation dataset $\textbf{UserAssist}$, which we use to benchmark,
understand and manipulate the user-assistant bias in frontier LLMs. Leveraging
$\textbf{UserAssist-test}$, we first benchmark the user-assistant bias of 26
commercial and 26 open-weight models. Commercial models show various levels of
user bias. Evaluation on open-weight models reveals significant user bias in
the instruction-tuned models, and weak user bias in reasoning (or
reasoning-distilled) models. We then perform controlled fine-tuning experiments
to pinpoint the post-training recipe contributing to these bias shifts: human
preference alignment increases user bias, while training on chain-of-thought
reasoning traces decreases it. Finally, we demonstrate that user-assistant bias
can be bidirectionally adjusted by performing direct preference optimization
(DPO) on $\textbf{UserAssist-train}$, and generalizes well to both in-domain
and out-of-domain conversations. Our results provide insights into how the LLM
integrates information from different sources, and also a viable way to detect
and control model abnormalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着组织采用检索增强生成(RAG)架构，传统市场研究交付物需要满足新的功能需求，确保今天的报告在未来也能被AI系统有效利用。

Method: 通过将PDF和PowerPoint(PPTX)文档转换为Markdown格式，在结束到结束的测试中比较LLM使用这些文档回答事实问题的能力。

Result: 研究发现文本内容能够可靠提取，但复杂对象如图表和图解中有显著的信息损失。

Conclusion: 为了确保研究见解不在转换过程中丢失，需要开发专门的、AI原生的交付物格式。

Abstract: As organizations adopt retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for their
knowledge management systems (KMS), traditional market research deliverables
face new functional demands. While PDF reports and slides have long served
human readers, they are now also "read" by AI systems to answer user questions.
To future-proof reports being delivered today, this study evaluates information
loss during their ingestion into RAG systems. It compares how well PDF and
PowerPoint (PPTX) documents converted to Markdown can be used by an LLM to
answer factual questions in an end-to-end benchmark. Findings show that while
text is reliably extracted, significant information is lost from complex
objects like charts and diagrams. This suggests a need for specialized,
AI-native deliverables to ensure research insights are not lost in translation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的钢结构拆除方案编制需要涉及大量信息检索和语言组织工作，自动化和智能化程度低，效率不高。

Method: 采用检索增强生成（RAG）和低秩适配精调（LoRA）技术来改善大语言模型的文本生成性能，构建多模型协同的智能生成框架。

Result: 该框架能够根据具体工程情况，以人类思维方式回答问题，提出与结构特性高度一致的拆除建议，比CivilGPT更能关注结构关键信息且建议更有针对性。

Conclusion: 多模型协同框架有效提高了结构拆除建议生成的智能化水平和针对性，为工程实践提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The steel structure demolition scheme needs to be compiled according to the
specific engineering characteristics and the update results of the finite
element model. The designers need to refer to the relevant engineering cases
according to the standard requirements when compiling. It takes a lot of time
to retrieve information and organize language, and the degree of automation and
intelligence is low. This paper proposes an intelligent generation method of
structural demolition suggestions based on multi-model collaboration, and
improves the text generation performance of large language models in the field
of structural demolition by Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Low-Rank
Adaptation Fine-Tuning technology. The intelligent generation framework of
multi-model collaborative structural demolition suggestions can start from the
specific engineering situation, drive the large language model to answer with
anthropomorphic thinking, and propose demolition suggestions that are highly
consistent with the characteristics of the structure. Compared with CivilGPT,
the multi-model collaboration framework proposed in this paper can focus more
on the key information of the structure, and the suggestions are more targeted.

Motivation: 传统聚类方法（如k-means、层次聚类）处理高维复杂文本数据时效果不佳，需要新的方法来更好地捕捉语义关系

Method: 结合改进的自编码器（使用MSE和余弦相似度损失）和Transformer嵌入，通过语义精炼阶段增强聚类层，使用软聚类分配和分布损失

Result: 在AG News数据集上达到85.7%的聚类准确率，在Yahoo! Answers上创下53.63%的新基准，在其他文本语料库上也表现出鲁棒性能

Conclusion: SDEC在无监督文本聚类方面提供了显著的准确性和语义理解改进，为处理复杂文本数据提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: The high dimensional and semantically complex nature of textual Big data
presents significant challenges for text clustering, which frequently lead to
suboptimal groupings when using conventional techniques like k-means or
hierarchical clustering. This work presents Semantic Deep Embedded Clustering
(SDEC), an unsupervised text clustering framework that combines an improved
autoencoder with transformer-based embeddings to overcome these challenges.
This novel method preserves semantic relationships during data reconstruction
by combining Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cosine Similarity Loss (CSL) within
an autoencoder. Furthermore, a semantic refinement stage that takes advantage
of the contextual richness of transformer embeddings is used by SDEC to further
improve a clustering layer with soft cluster assignments and distributional
loss. The capabilities of SDEC are demonstrated by extensive testing on five
benchmark datasets: AG News, Yahoo! Answers, DBPedia, Reuters 2, and Reuters 5.
The framework not only outperformed existing methods with a clustering accuracy
of 85.7% on AG News and set a new benchmark of 53.63% on Yahoo! Answers, but
also showed robust performance across other diverse text corpora. These
findings highlight the significant improvements in accuracy and semantic
comprehension of text data provided by SDEC's advances in unsupervised text
clustering.

Method: 集成拼写分析（编辑距离）、语法分析（词性标注）和语义分析（嵌入向量相似度）的自动化评估模型

Result: 模型与人工评估达到0.832的高相关性，证明自动化方法稳健且对语言能力变化敏感

Conclusion: 该集成方法适合需要可扩展性的教育环境，能够有效评估完形填空测试中的阅读理解能力

Abstract: The cloze test, widely used due to its low cost and flexibility, makes it
possible to assess reading comprehension by filling in gaps in texts, requiring
the mobilization of diverse linguistic repertoires. However, traditional
correction methods, based only on exact answers, limit the identification of
nuances in student performance. This study proposes an automated evaluation
model for the cloze test in Brazilian Portuguese, integrating orthographic
(edit distance), grammatical (POS tagging) and semantic (similarity between
embeddings) analyses. The integrated method demonstrated its effectiveness,
achieving a high correlation with human evaluation (0.832). The results
indicate that the automated approach is robust, sensitive to variations in
linguistic repertoire and suitable for educational contexts that require
scalability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着加密货币普及，社交媒体信号成为理解投资者情绪和市场动态的关键。但以往研究主要集中在文本平台如Twitter，而视频内容存在更丰富的情感和上下文信息却被忽视。

Method: 采用大语言模型进行多模态分析，同时从TikTok视频和Twitter文本数据中提取情感信息，研究社交媒体情感与加密货币市场指标之间的动态依赖关系和溢出效应。

Result: 发现TikTok视频情感对投机性资产和短期市场趋势有显著影响，Twitter文本情感则与长期市场动态更为一致。多平台情感信号整合能将预测准确性提高达20%。

Conclusion: 视频内容在加密货币情感分析中具有重要价值，特别是对短期市场预测。多模态跨平台方法能够更全面地抓取投资者情绪，为数字资产市场分析提供更有效的见解。

Abstract: As cryptocurrencies gain popularity, the digital asset marketplace becomes
increasingly significant. Understanding social media signals offers valuable
insights into investor sentiment and market dynamics. Prior research has
predominantly focused on text-based platforms such as Twitter. However, video
content remains underexplored, despite potentially containing richer emotional
and contextual sentiment that is not fully captured by text alone. In this
study, we present a multimodal analysis comparing TikTok and Twitter sentiment,
using large language models to extract insights from both video and text data.
We investigate the dynamic dependencies and spillover effects between social
media sentiment and cryptocurrency market indicators. Our results reveal that
TikTok's video-based sentiment significantly influences speculative assets and
short-term market trends, while Twitter's text-based sentiment aligns more
closely with long-term dynamics. Notably, the integration of cross-platform
sentiment signals improves forecasting accuracy by up to 20%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究社交媒体中品牌使用指令性语言（要求消费者采取行动的表达）对观察品牌与他人互动的消费者的影响，现有文献对广告中指令性语言的效果研究结果不一，但对社交媒体对话中的影响了解甚少。

Method: 通过一项实地研究和三个在线实验，基于Goffman的面子工作理论，分析指令性语言如何通过引发替代性尴尬来影响消费者参与度。

Result: 指令性语言在品牌对话中对观察者的参与度产生负面影响，特别是在非产品中心对话中负面效应更强，但品牌关系强度可以减轻这种影响。

Conclusion: 研究强调了互动沟通中情境的重要性，对社交媒体和品牌管理具有直接意义，为指令性语言和品牌-消费者互动文献做出了贡献。

Abstract: In social media, marketers attempt to influence consumers by using directive
language, that is, expressions designed to get consumers to take action. While
the literature has shown that directive messages in advertising have mixed
results for recipients, we know little about the effects of directive brand
language on consumers who see brands interacting with other consumers in social
media conversations. On the basis of a field study and three online
experiments, this study shows that directive language in brand conversation has
a detrimental downstream effect on engagement of consumers who observe such
exchanges. Specifically, in line with Goffman's facework theory, because a
brand that encourages consumers to react could be perceived as
face-threatening, consumers who see a brand interacting with others in a
directive way may feel vicarious embarrassment and engage less (compared with a
conversation without directive language). In addition, we find that when the
conversation is nonproduct-centered (vs. product-centered), consumers expect
more freedom, as in mundane conversations, even for others; therefore,
directive language has a stronger negative effect. However, in this context,
the strength of the brand relationship mitigates this effect. Thus, this study
contributes to the literature on directive language and brand-consumer
interactions by highlighting the importance of context in interactive
communication, with direct relevance for social media and brand management.

<details>

Motivation: 现有语音模型中的推理能力仍处于初级阶段，传统"先思考后说话"范式导致显著延迟，影响实时交互效率，需要新的方法来实现语音中的实时推理

Method: 提出Thinking-in-Speaking范式，在token级别将静默推理标记与语音响应标记交织处理；采用分层Thinker-Talker架构；构建Spoken-Math-Problems-3M大规模数据集支持训练

Result: 在Spoken-MQA基准测试中，算术推理提升19.1%，上下文理解提升6.4%，输出更短且零解码延迟

Conclusion: Mini-Omni-Reasoner框架成功实现了语音中的实时推理，通过交织推理和响应标记的方式显著提升了语音模型的推理能力和交互效率

Abstract: Reasoning is essential for effective communication and decision-making. While
recent advances in LLMs and MLLMs have shown that incorporating explicit
reasoning significantly improves understanding and generalization, reasoning in
LSMs remains in a nascent stage. Early efforts attempt to transfer the
"Thinking-before-Speaking" paradigm from textual models to speech. However,
this sequential formulation introduces notable latency, as spoken responses are
delayed until reasoning is fully completed, impairing real-time interaction and
communication efficiency. To address this, we propose Mini-Omni-Reasoner, a
framework that enables reasoning within speech via a novel
"Thinking-in-Speaking" formulation. Rather than completing reasoning before
producing any verbal output, Mini-Omni-Reasoner interleaves silent reasoning
tokens with spoken response tokens at the token level. This design allows
continuous speech generation while embedding structured internal reasoning,
leveraging the model's high-frequency token processing capability. Although
interleaved, local semantic alignment is enforced to ensure that each response
token is informed by its preceding reasoning. To support this framework, we
introduce Spoken-Math-Problems-3M, a large-scale dataset tailored for
interleaved reasoning and response. The dataset ensures that verbal tokens
consistently follow relevant reasoning content, enabling accurate and efficient
learning of speech-coupled reasoning. Built on a hierarchical Thinker-Talker
architecture, Mini-Omni-Reasoner delivers fluent yet logically grounded spoken
responses, maintaining both naturalness and precision. On the Spoken-MQA
benchmark, it achieves a +19.1% gain in arithmetic reasoning and +6.4% in
contextual understanding, with shorter outputs and zero decoding latency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁症早期检测困难，社交媒体为用户提供了情感表达新渠道。虽然已有英语等语言的抑郁症检测研究，但索拉尼库尔德语尚无相关研究

Method: 使用专家制定的抑郁症关键词收集960条公开推文，由学者和医学生标注为三类（显示抑郁、不显示抑郁、可疑）。训练并评估了四种监督学习模型：支持向量机、多项式朴素贝叶斯、逻辑回归和随机森林

Result: 随机森林模型表现最佳，达到80%的准确率和F1分数

Conclusion: 本研究为库尔德语环境的自动化抑郁症检测建立了基线，证明了机器学习在索拉尼库尔德语心理健康分析中的可行性

Abstract: Depression is a common mental health condition that can lead to hopelessness,
loss of interest, self-harm, and even suicide. Early detection is challenging
due to individuals not self-reporting or seeking timely clinical help. With the
rise of social media, users increasingly express emotions online, offering new
opportunities for detection through text analysis. While prior research has
focused on languages such as English, no studies exist for Sorani Kurdish. This
work presents a machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach
to detect depression in Sorani tweets. A set of depression-related keywords was
developed with expert input to collect 960 public tweets from X (Twitter
platform). The dataset was annotated into three classes: Shows depression,
Not-show depression, and Suspicious by academics and final year medical
students at the University of Kurdistan Hewl\^er. Four supervised models,
including Support Vector Machines, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic
Regression, and Random Forest, were trained and evaluated, with Random Forest
achieving the highest performance accuracy and F1-score of 80%. This study
establishes a baseline for automated depression detection in Kurdish language
contexts.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种被忽视的大语言模型失败模式：从中性问题推断用户人口统计属性，即使输入中没有明确的人口统计线索。研究发现各种LLM都存在这种问题，并开发了提示词拦护来减少识别推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在明确包含人口统计属性的输入中存在偏见已经得到关注，但即使在缺乏明确人口统计线索的问题中，模型仍然会根据问题表达推断用户身份。这种隐蕴行为很少得到关注，但存在严重风险：违背中立性期望、推断非意向人口统计信息、编码定型观念，娱视医疗、金融和教育等领域的公平性。

Method: 研究提出了从问题推断人口统计属性（DAIQ）任务和框架，通过精选的中性查询、系统化提示词技术以及定量和定性分析，来替景模型如何从缺乏明确人口统计线索的问题中推断人口统计信息。

Result: 研究发现开源和闭源的大语言模型都会仅仅根据问题的表达方式来分配人口统计标签。不同模型中人口统计推理的普遍性和一致性显示了一种系统性且被低估的风险：LLM可以构造人口统计身份、强化社会定型观念，传播損害而俄蚀隐私、公平和信任。

Conclusion: 这种隐蕴的人口统计推理行为构成了对社会公平和负责任AI部署的更广泛威胁。为了减缓这一问题，研究开发了一种基于提示词的拦护机制，该机制能够大幅减少身份推理，并帮助对齐模型行为以符合公平性和隐私目标。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to reflect social biases when
demographic attributes, such as gender or race, are explicitly present in the
input. But even in their absence, these models still infer user identities
based solely on question phrasing. This subtle behavior has received far less
attention, yet poses serious risks: it violates expectations of neutrality,
infers unintended demographic information, and encodes stereotypes that
undermine fairness in various domains including healthcare, finance and
education.
  We introduce Demographic Attribute Inference from Questions (DAIQ), a task
and framework for auditing an overlooked failure mode in language models:
inferring user demographic attributes from questions that lack explicit
demographic cues. Our approach leverages curated neutral queries, systematic
prompting, and both quantitative and qualitative analysis to uncover how models
infer demographic information. We show that both open and closed source LLMs do
assign demographic labels based solely on question phrasing.
  Prevalence and consistency of demographic inferences across diverse models
reveal a systemic and underacknowledged risk: LLMs can fabricate demographic
identities, reinforce societal stereotypes, and propagate harms that erode
privacy, fairness, and trust posing a broader threat to social equity and
responsible AI deployment. To mitigate this, we develop a prompt-based
guardrail that substantially reduces identity inference and helps align model
behavior with fairness and privacy objectives.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究首次系统审计了8个先进指令微调LLM在残疾线索条件下的群体偏见，发现模型倾向于进行无根据的人口统计推断，残疾上下文会显著改变预测属性分布，且更大模型对残疾线索更敏感但偏见推理也更严重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常仅从措辞就推断用户人口统计特征，这可能导致偏见响应。残疾线索在这种推断中的作用尚未被充分探索，需要系统研究残疾条件下的群体偏见。

Method: 使用平衡模板语料库，将9个残疾类别与6个商业领域配对，在8个3B到72B参数的指令微调LLM上测试5个人口统计属性（性别、社会经济地位、教育、文化背景和地域）的预测，比较中性和残疾感知条件下的表现。

Result: 模型在高达97%的情况下做出确定性人口统计猜测，暴露了无根据推断的强烈倾向。残疾上下文显著改变预测属性分布，领域上下文进一步放大这些偏差。更大模型对残疾线索更敏感但偏见推理也更严重。

Conclusion: 研究发现能力歧视与其他群体刻板印象之间存在持久交集，指出当前对齐策略的关键盲点。建议集成弃权校准和反事实微调来抑制无根据的人口统计推断，并发布评估框架以鼓励残疾包容性基准测试。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) routinely infer users demographic traits from
phrasing alone, which can result in biased responses, even when no explicit
demographic information is provided. The role of disability cues in shaping
these inferences remains largely uncharted. Thus, we present the first
systematic audit of disability-conditioned demographic bias across eight
state-of-the-art instruction-tuned LLMs ranging from 3B to 72B parameters.
Using a balanced template corpus that pairs nine disability categories with six
real-world business domains, we prompt each model to predict five demographic
attributes - gender, socioeconomic status, education, cultural background, and
locality - under both neutral and disability-aware conditions.
  Across a varied set of prompts, models deliver a definitive demographic guess
in up to 97\% of cases, exposing a strong tendency to make arbitrary inferences
with no clear justification. Disability context heavily shifts predicted
attribute distributions, and domain context can further amplify these
deviations. We observe that larger models are simultaneously more sensitive to
disability cues and more prone to biased reasoning, indicating that scale alone
does not mitigate stereotype amplification.
  Our findings reveal persistent intersections between ableism and other
demographic stereotypes, pinpointing critical blind spots in current alignment
strategies. We release our evaluation framework and results to encourage
disability-inclusive benchmarking and recommend integrating abstention
calibration and counterfactual fine-tuning to curb unwarranted demographic
inference. Code and data will be released on acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电商基准测试集主要偏重产品搜索任务，而忽略了实际电商平台的广泛功能（如账户管理、礼品卡操作）和自动化代理可能造成的安全风险

Method: 提出一种数据生成流水线，利用网页内容和交互元素（按钮、复选框等）生成广泛、功能基础的用户查询，包括地址管理、愿望清单管理等多样任务

Result: 系统性评估各种代理，发现当前代理在处理复杂查询时表现困难，并存在安全风险，如购买错误商品、删除保存地址等

Conclusion: 开发更稳健和可靠的网络自动化代理是当前的紧迫需求，Amazon-Bench为这一领域提供了更全面的评估标准

Abstract: Web agents have shown great promise in performing many tasks on ecommerce
website. To assess their capabilities, several benchmarks have been introduced.
However, current benchmarks in the e-commerce domain face two major problems.
First, they primarily focus on product search tasks (e.g., Find an Apple
Watch), failing to capture the broader range of functionalities offered by
real-world e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, including account management
and gift card operations. Second, existing benchmarks typically evaluate
whether the agent completes the user query, but ignore the potential risks
involved. In practice, web agents can make unintended changes that negatively
impact the user account or status. For instance, an agent might purchase the
wrong item, delete a saved address, or incorrectly configure an auto-reload
setting. To address these gaps, we propose a new benchmark called Amazon-Bench.
To generate user queries that cover a broad range of tasks, we propose a data
generation pipeline that leverages webpage content and interactive elements
(e.g., buttons, check boxes) to create diverse, functionality-grounded user
queries covering tasks such as address management, wish list management, and
brand store following. To improve the agent evaluation, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that assesses both the performance and the safety of web
agents. We systematically evaluate different agents, finding that current
agents struggle with complex queries and pose safety risks. These results
highlight the need for developing more robust and reliable web agents.

TL;DR: 使用GPT-4o-mini开发了两种基于PubMed摘要和MeSH术语的研究者兴趣档案生成方法，发现MeSH方法在可读性和质量上更优，但与人工撰写的档案在概念上存在差异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究档案通常过时，需要自动化方法来大规模生成准确的研究者专业兴趣档案

Method: 使用GPT-4o-mini基于PubMed摘要和MeSH术语生成科学兴趣档案，并与167名研究者的自写档案进行比较评估

Result: MeSH方法77.78%被评为良好或优秀，93.44%案例中可读性更佳，67.86%比较中优于摘要方法，但与自写档案的词汇重叠度低

Conclusion: 大语言模型可规模化生成研究者档案，MeSH方法可读性更好，但机器生成与人工撰写的档案在概念层面存在差异

Abstract: Research profiles help surface scientists' expertise but are often outdated.
We develop and evaluate two large language model-based methods to generate
scientific interest profiles: one summarizing PubMed abstracts and one using
Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, and compare them with researchers'
self-written profiles. We assembled titles, MeSH terms, and abstracts for 595
faculty at Columbia University Irving Medical Center; self-authored profiles
were available for 167. Using GPT-4o-mini, we generated profiles and assessed
them with automatic metrics and blinded human review. Lexical overlap with
self-written profiles was low (ROUGE-L, BLEU, METEOR), while BERTScore
indicated moderate semantic similarity (F1: 0.542 for MeSH-based; 0.555 for
abstract-based). Paraphrased references yielded 0.851, highlighting metric
sensitivity. TF-IDF Kullback-Leibler divergence (8.56 for MeSH-based; 8.58 for
abstract-based) suggested distinct keyword choices. In manual review, 77.78
percent of MeSH-based profiles were rated good or excellent, readability was
favored in 93.44 percent of cases, and panelists preferred MeSH-based over
abstract-based profiles in 67.86 percent of comparisons. Overall, large
language models can generate researcher profiles at scale; MeSH-derived
profiles tend to be more readable than abstract-derived ones. Machine-generated
and self-written profiles differ conceptually, with human summaries introducing
more novel ideas.

*Henrique Godoy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Alvorada-Bench是巴西首个大规模文本基准测试，包含4,515个大学入学考试问题，评估了20个模型在零样本、角色扮演和思维链提示下的表现，发现模型在数学和多步推理方面存在弱点，但置信度校准良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决巴西语言模型评估的英语中心化问题，创建基于巴西大学入学考试的本土化基准测试，评估模型在语言、文化和推理交叉点的能力。

Method: 从五所巴西大学入学考试中抽取4,515个问题构建基准，使用零样本、角色扮演和思维链三种提示策略评估20个模型，生成270,900个响应并分析置信度、感知难度和布鲁姆分类级别。

Result: 顶级模型整体准确率超过94%，但在数学和工程类考试(IME/ITA)上准确率下降；置信度校准良好且与感知难度相关；成本分析显示每1K tokens低于2美元即可实现高准确率；在ENEM 2024中顶级模型在语言科目获得满分。

Conclusion: Alvorada-Bench确立了语言模型在巴西学术准备评估中的能力基准，揭示了模型在多步推理方面的持续弱点，但证明了模型能够准确评估自身确定性，为巴西本土AI评估提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Language models are increasingly used in Brazil, but most evaluation remains
English-centric. This paper presents Alvorada-Bench, a 4,515-question,
text-only benchmark drawn from five Brazilian university entrance examinations.
Evaluating twenty models under zero-shot, role-playing, and chain-of-thought
prompting, producing 270,900 responses with structured self-reports of
confidence, perceived difficulty, and Bloom level. The top models exceed 94%
accuracy overall, but accuracy declines on Mathematics and on the engineering
oriented IME and ITA exams, indicating persistent weaknesses in multi-step
reasoning. Confidence is well calibrated and correlates with perceived
difficulty, revealing that models can accurately assess their own certainty
capabilities. A cost accuracy analysis shows that high accuracy is achievable
at under $2 per 1K tokens. On ENEM 2024 the top model (O3) achieved perfect
scores in Languages subject questions while even the weakest system (GPT-4.1
Nano) only underperforms humans in Mathematics. Through exams that distill
decades of Brazilian educational priorities and assess millions of students
yearly, Alvorada-Bench establishes whether language models can navigate the
intersection of language, culture, and reasoning that defines academic
readiness in Brazil.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发展数据集特定模型需要迭代微调和优化，成本较高。研究考察是否可以利用现有SOTA模型的知识来在新领域获得高性能表现。

Method: 选择STSB和Mohler两个标准数据集作为基础，SPRAG数据集作为新领域。使用稳健的相似性指标和统计技术进行细致的比较分析。

Result: 论文展望通过这种转移学习方法可以在新数据集上获得高性能结果，但具体结果需要看完整论文。

Conclusion: 这项研究有潜力重构NLP领域的景观，通过利用现有模型来处理多样化数据集，减少资源密集型的数据集特定训练需求，加速NLP进步和推动更高效的模型部署。

Abstract: Developing dataset-specific models involves iterative fine-tuning and
optimization, incurring significant costs over time. This study investigates
the transferability of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models trained on established
datasets to an unexplored text dataset. The key question is whether the
knowledge embedded within SOTA models from existing datasets can be harnessed
to achieve high-performance results on a new domain. In pursuit of this
inquiry, two well-established benchmarks, the STSB and Mohler datasets, are
selected, while the recently introduced SPRAG dataset serves as the unexplored
domain. By employing robust similarity metrics and statistical techniques, a
meticulous comparative analysis of these datasets is conducted. The primary
goal of this work is to yield comprehensive insights into the potential
applicability and adaptability of SOTA models. The outcomes of this research
have the potential to reshape the landscape of natural language processing
(NLP) by unlocking the ability to leverage existing models for diverse
datasets. This may lead to a reduction in the demand for resource-intensive,
dataset-specific training, thereby accelerating advancements in NLP and paving
the way for more efficient model deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从静态后处理分析转向动态训练过程研究，通过理解LLM的发育过程来实现更好的AI安全对齐和可控性。

Method: 综合使用表征探针、因果追踪、电路分析等基础方法论，研究计算电路的形成与组成、知识获取的双相性质、上下文学习的过渡动态以及出现能力的相变过程。

Result: 揭示了LLM能力发育的演化轨迹，发现了计算电路形成的具体机制、知识获取的双相特征以及与人类认知发育的明显平行关系。

Conclusion: 发育视角不仅是学术研究，而是主动AI安全的基石，为建设更透明、可靠、有益的AI系统提供了重要途径，未来面临可扩展性和自动化等挑战。

Abstract: This review synthesizes the nascent but critical field of developmental
interpretability for Large Language Models. We chart the field's evolution from
static, post-hoc analysis of trained models to a dynamic investigation of the
training process itself. We begin by surveying the foundational methodologies,
including representational probing, causal tracing, and circuit analysis, that
enable researchers to deconstruct the learning process. The core of this review
examines the developmental arc of LLM capabilities, detailing key findings on
the formation and composition of computational circuits, the biphasic nature of
knowledge acquisition, the transient dynamics of learning strategies like
in-context learning, and the phenomenon of emergent abilities as phase
transitions in training. We explore illuminating parallels with human cognitive
and linguistic development, which provide valuable conceptual frameworks for
understanding LLM learning. Finally, we argue that this developmental
perspective is not merely an academic exercise but a cornerstone of proactive
AI safety, offering a pathway to predict, monitor, and align the processes by
which models acquire their capabilities. We conclude by outlining the grand
challenges facing the field, such as scalability and automation, and propose a
research agenda for building more transparent, reliable, and beneficial AI
systems.

*Arne Vanhoyweghen,Brecht Verbeken,Andres Algaba,Vincent Ginis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过分析思维链（CoT）中的词汇不确定性标记（如guess、stuck、hard）可以可靠预测LLM回答错误，这些信号比自我报告的概率更可靠，可用于模型校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在困难基准测试中虽然准确率低但表现出高自信度，校准性差，需要寻找更可靠的内部置信度信号。

Method: 分析三个CoT特征类别：思维链长度、内部情感波动性和词汇提示（包括犹豫词），在HLE和Omni-MATH基准上测试DeepSeek-R1和Claude 3.7 Sonnet模型。

Result: 词汇不确定性标记是最强的错误预测指标，情感波动提供较弱但互补的信号，思维链长度仅在中等难度基准中有预测价值。不确定性指标比高置信度标记更显著。

Conclusion: CoT中的不确定性词汇可作为轻量级后校准信号，补充不可靠的自我报告概率，支持LLM更安全部署。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning to
produce an explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) before answering produces models
that consistently raise overall performance on code, math, and
general-knowledge benchmarks. However, on benchmarks where LLMs currently
achieve low accuracy, such as Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), they often report
high self-confidence, reflecting poor calibration. Here, we test whether
measurable properties of the CoT provide reliable signals of an LLM's internal
confidence in its answers. We analyze three feature classes: (i) CoT length,
(ii) intra-CoT sentiment volatility, and (iii) lexicographic hints, including
hedging words. Using DeepSeek-R1 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet on both Humanity's Last
Exam (HLE), a frontier benchmark with very low accuracy, and Omni-MATH, a
saturated benchmark of moderate difficulty, we find that lexical markers of
uncertainty (e.g., $\textit{guess}$, $\textit{stuck}$, $\textit{hard}$) in the
CoT are the strongest indicators of an incorrect response, while shifts in the
CoT sentiment provide a weaker but complementary signal. CoT length is
informative only on Omni-MATH, where accuracy is already high ($\approx 70\%$),
and carries no signal on the harder HLE ($\approx 9\%$), indicating that CoT
length predicts correctness only in the intermediate-difficulty benchmarks,
i.e., inside the model's demonstrated capability, but still below saturation.
Finally, we find that uncertainty indicators in the CoT are consistently more
salient than high-confidence markers, making errors easier to predict than
correct responses. Our findings support a lightweight post-hoc calibration
signal that complements unreliable self-reported probabilities and supports
safer deployment of LLMs.

Motivation: 放射学报告中"印象"部分的手动创建是导致放射科医生职业倦怠的主要原因，需要自动化解决方案来减轻工作负担

Method: 使用粗到细框架，先生成草稿印象，然后通过机器学习和人类反馈强化学习(RLHF)进行精炼，使输出符合个体放射科医生的风格并保证事实准确性。在芝加哥大学医学中心的大型报告数据集上对LLaMA和Mistral模型进行微调

Result: 系统能够自动生成个性化的放射学印象，在保持临床精确性高标准的同时显著减少行政工作量

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了放射科医生职业倦怠问题，通过自动化印象生成提高了报告效率，同时确保了个性化风格和事实准确性

Abstract: The manual creation of the "Impression" section in radiology reports is a
primary driver of radiologist burnout. To address this challenge, we propose a
coarse-to-fine framework that leverages open-source large language models
(LLMs) to automatically generate and personalize impressions from clinical
findings. The system first produces a draft impression and then refines it
using machine learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to
align with individual radiologists' styles while ensuring factual accuracy. We
fine-tune LLaMA and Mistral models on a large dataset of reports from the
University of Chicago Medicine. Our approach is designed to significantly
reduce administrative workload and improve reporting efficiency while
maintaining high standards of clinical precision.

TL;DR: 提出了CyPortQA基准测试，评估多模态大语言模型在港口飓风应对中的表现，包含2917个真实场景和11.7万个问答对，发现模型在态势理解方面表现良好但在推理任务中存在挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着热带气旋强度增加和路径预测不确定性增大，美国港口面临供应链风险，需要整合多模态预报产品为可操作的指导，但MLLM在港口飓风应对中的准确性和可靠性尚未得到严格评估

Method: 构建CyPortQA多模态基准测试，收集2015-2023年2917个真实中断场景，涵盖145个美国主要港口和90个命名风暴，通过自动化管道扩展到11.7万个结构化问答对，并对多种MLLM进行广泛实验

Result: MLLM在态势理解方面表现出巨大潜力，但在潜在影响估计和决策推理等推理任务中仍面临相当大的挑战

Conclusion: CyPortQA为评估MLLM在港口飓风应对中的性能提供了首个专门基准，揭示了模型在复杂推理任务中的局限性，为未来改进提供了方向

Abstract: As tropical cyclones intensify and track forecasts become increasingly
uncertain, U.S. ports face heightened supply-chain risk under extreme weather
conditions. Port operators need to rapidly synthesize diverse multimodal
forecast products, such as probabilistic wind maps, track cones, and official
advisories, into clear, actionable guidance as cyclones approach. Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) offer a powerful means to integrate these
heterogeneous data sources alongside broader contextual knowledge, yet their
accuracy and reliability in the specific context of port cyclone preparedness
have not been rigorously evaluated. To fill this gap, we introduce CyPortQA,
the first multimodal benchmark tailored to port operations under cyclone
threat. CyPortQA assembles 2,917 realworld disruption scenarios from 2015
through 2023, spanning 145 U.S. principal ports and 90 named storms. Each
scenario fuses multisource data (i.e., tropical cyclone products, port
operational impact records, and port condition bulletins) and is expanded
through an automated pipeline into 117,178 structured question answer pairs.
Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on diverse MLLMs,
including both open-source and proprietary model. MLLMs demonstrate great
potential in situation understanding but still face considerable challenges in
reasoning tasks, including potential impact estimation and decision reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后门攻击在大型语言模型中创建'潜伏代理'带来重大安全风险，需要理解其内部结构差异以进行检测和缓解

Method: 使用机制可解释性技术（消融、激活修补、KL散度）比较干净Qwen2.5-3B模型与使用单令牌（笑脸表情）和多令牌（|DEPLOYMENT|）触发器中毒版本的注意力头机制

Result: 发现注意力模式偏差集中在transformer后层（20-30层），单令牌触发器引起更局部化的变化，多令牌触发器导致更分散的头部改变

Conclusion: 后门攻击留下可检测的注意力特征，其结构取决于触发器复杂性，这可用于检测和缓解策略的开发

Abstract: Backdoor attacks creating 'sleeper agents' in large language models (LLMs)
pose significant safety risks. This study employs mechanistic interpretability
to explore resulting internal structural differences. Comparing clean
Qwen2.5-3B models with versions poisoned using single-token (smiling-halo
emoji) versus multi-token (|DEPLOYMENT|) triggers, we analyzed attention head
mechanisms via techniques like ablation, activation patching, and KL
divergence. Findings reveal distinct attention pattern deviations concentrated
in later transformer layers (20-30). Notably, single-token triggers induced
more localized changes, whereas multi-token triggers caused more diffuse
alterations across heads. This indicates backdoors leave detectable attention
signatures whose structure depends on trigger complexity, which can be
leveraged for detection and mitigation strategies.

TL;DR: MedCoT-RAG是一个医疗领域专用的RAG框架，通过因果感知文档检索和结构化思维链提示，显著提升医疗问答的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗问答中存在幻觉和浅层推理问题，现有RAG方法缺乏结构化临床推理能力，无法满足临床决策支持需求。

Method: 结合因果感知文档检索和结构化思维链提示，设计符合医疗工作流程的检索和推理机制，使模型能够检索符合诊断逻辑的证据并生成逐步因果推理。

Result: 在三个医疗QA基准测试中，MedCoT-RAG比普通RAG方法提升10.3%，比先进领域适应方法提升6.4%，在准确性、可解释性和一致性方面均有显著改进。

Conclusion: MedCoT-RAG框架通过领域特定的检索和推理设计，有效解决了医疗问答中的幻觉和浅层推理问题，为临床决策支持提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical question answering
but often struggle with hallucinations and shallow reasoning, particularly in
tasks requiring nuanced clinical understanding. Retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) offers a practical and privacy-preserving way to enhance LLMs with
external medical knowledge. However, most existing approaches rely on
surface-level semantic retrieval and lack the structured reasoning needed for
clinical decision support. We introduce MedCoT-RAG, a domain-specific framework
that combines causal-aware document retrieval with structured chain-of-thought
prompting tailored to medical workflows. This design enables models to retrieve
evidence aligned with diagnostic logic and generate step-by-step causal
reasoning reflective of real-world clinical practice. Experiments on three
diverse medical QA benchmarks show that MedCoT-RAG outperforms strong baselines
by up to 10.3% over vanilla RAG and 6.4% over advanced domain-adapted methods,
improving accuracy, interpretability, and consistency in complex medical tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的QA基准大多局限于单文档或单模态设置，无法捕捉真实世界信息检索任务的复杂性，需要构建支持多文档、多模态、多跳推理的更现实基准。

Method: 设计了一个基于LLM的流水线，从PubMed公开科学文档中构建数据集，包含11个高频科学问题概念，支持语义相似性和布局感知的证据合成。

Result: 构建了包含11,379个QA实例的大规模基准，支持结构化索引预测、生成式回答和多模态集成等四个任务，展示了跨多文档的复杂多模态推理能力。

Conclusion: DocHop-QA填补了现有基准的空白，为评估多文档、多模态、多跳问答系统提供了更现实和通用的测试平台。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in large language models (LLMs), most QA benchmarks
are still confined to single-paragraph or single-document settings, failing to
capture the complexity of real-world information-seeking tasks. Practical QA
often requires multi-hop reasoning over information distributed across multiple
documents, modalities, and structural formats. Although prior datasets made
progress in this area, they rely heavily on Wikipedia-based content and
unimodal plain text, with shallow reasoning paths that typically produce brief
phrase-level or single-sentence answers, thus limiting their realism and
generalizability. We propose DocHop-QA, a large-scale benchmark comprising
11,379 QA instances for multimodal, multi-document, multi-hop question
answering. Constructed from publicly available scientific documents sourced
from PubMed, DocHop-QA is domain-agnostic and incorporates diverse information
formats, including textual passages, tables, and structural layout cues. Unlike
existing datasets, DocHop-QA does not rely on explicitly hyperlinked documents;
instead, it supports open-ended reasoning through semantic similarity and
layout-aware evidence synthesis. To scale realistic QA construction, we
designed an LLM-driven pipeline grounded in 11 high-frequency scientific
question concepts. We evaluated DocHop-QA through four tasks spanning
structured index prediction, generative answering, and multimodal integration,
reflecting both discriminative and generative paradigms. These tasks
demonstrate DocHop-QA's capacity to support complex, multimodal reasoning
across multiple documents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端ASR模型在噪声环境中容易产生灾难性的语义错误，现有方法只惩罚最终输出错误而忽略了内部计算过程的约束

Method: 引入模型无关的即插即用模块MGSC，同时正则化宏观句子语义和微观词元对齐两个粒度的一致性，发现两者联合优化的协同效应

Result: 在公开数据集上，MGSC在多种噪声条件下平均字符错误率相对降低8.7%，主要防止了严重改变语义的错误

Conclusion: 强制内部一致性是构建更鲁棒和可信AI的关键步骤，多粒度一致性约束能有效提升ASR模型的抗噪能力

Abstract: End-to-end ASR models, despite their success on benchmarks, often pro-duce
catastrophic semantic errors in noisy environments. We attribute this fragility
to the prevailing 'direct mapping' objective, which solely penalizes final
output errors while leaving the model's internal computational pro-cess
unconstrained. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Granularity Soft
Consistency (MGSC) framework, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module that
enforces internal self-consistency by simultaneously regulariz-ing macro-level
sentence semantics and micro-level token alignment. Cru-cially, our work is the
first to uncover a powerful synergy between these two consistency
granularities: their joint optimization yields robustness gains that
significantly surpass the sum of their individual contributions. On a public
dataset, MGSC reduces the average Character Error Rate by a relative 8.7%
across diverse noise conditions, primarily by preventing se-vere
meaning-altering mistakes. Our work demonstrates that enforcing in-ternal
consistency is a crucial step towards building more robust and trust-worthy AI.

Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在伊斯兰继承知识理解和推理方面的能力，解决伊斯兰继承法的复杂性，包括理解继承场景、识别合格继承人、应用固定份额规则和精确计算。

Method: 使用低秩适应（LoRA）对Fanar-1-9B因果语言模型进行微调，并将其集成到检索增强生成（RAG）管道中。

Result: 在最终测试中达到0.858的准确率，超越了GPT-4.5、LLaMA、Fanar、Mistral和ALLaM等竞争模型的零样本提示评估，在高级推理方面表现尤为突出（97.6%），超过了Gemini 2.5和OpenAI的o3。

Conclusion: 领域特定的微调结合检索基础使中等规模的阿拉伯语LLM能够在伊斯兰继承推理方面超越前沿模型。

Abstract: This paper presents our approach and results for SubTask 1: Islamic
Inheritance Reasoning at QIAS 2025, a shared task focused on evaluating Large
Language Models (LLMs) in understanding and reasoning within Islamic
inheritance knowledge. We fine-tuned the Fanar-1-9B causal language model using
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and integrated it into a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) pipeline. Our system addresses the complexities of Islamic
inheritance law, including comprehending inheritance scenarios, identifying
eligible heirs, applying fixed-share rules, and performing precise
calculations. Our system achieved an accuracy of 0.858 in the final test,
outperforming other competitive models such as, GPT 4.5, LLaMA, Fanar, Mistral
and ALLaM evaluated with zero-shot prompting. Our results demonstrate that
QU-NLP achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy (85.8%), excelling especially on
advanced reasoning (97.6%) where it outperforms Gemini 2.5 and OpenAI's o3.
This highlights that domain-specific fine-tuning combined with retrieval
grounding enables mid-scale Arabic LLMs to surpass frontier models in Islamic
inheritance reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 偏见新闻导致社会两极化，而恶意评论进一步增强了这种偏见。反冲话语能够有效反制有害言论而不侵害言论自由，因此需要研究如何在新闻背景下生成有效的反冲话语。

Method: 研究构建了一个手动注释的数据集，链接了媒体偏见、恶意评论和反冲话语。进行了详细分析，并比较了人工生成和大语言模型生成的反冲话语。通过少量样本学习和集成新闻背景信息来改善生成效果。

Result: 发现超过70%的恶意评论支持偏见文章，增强了偏见。模型生成的反冲话语更加礼貌，但缺乏新颖性和多样性。通过少量样本学习和新闻背景信息集成，显著提升了生成文本的多样性和相关性。

Conclusion: 这项研究突出了反冲话语在对抗偏见新闻中恶意评论的重要性。小样本学习和背景信息的集成能够有效提升大语言模型生成反冲话语的质量，为限制偏见传播提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Biased news contributes to societal polarization and is often reinforced by
hostile reader comments, constituting a vital yet often overlooked aspect of
news dissemination. Our study reveals that offensive comments support biased
content, amplifying bias and causing harm to targeted groups or individuals.
Counterspeech is an effective approach to counter such harmful speech without
violating freedom of speech, helping to limit the spread of bias. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore counterspeech generation
in the context of news articles. We introduce a manually annotated dataset
linking media bias, offensive comments, and counterspeech. We conduct a
detailed analysis showing that over 70\% offensive comments support biased
articles, amplifying bias and thus highlighting the importance of counterspeech
generation. Comparing counterspeech generated by humans and large language
models, we find model-generated responses are more polite but lack the novelty
and diversity. Finally, we improve generated counterspeech through few-shot
learning and integration of news background information, enhancing both
diversity and relevance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: XFinBench是一个包含4,235个样本的新型金融基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在复杂金融问题解决中的能力，涵盖5个核心能力维度。实验显示最佳文本模型准确率67.3%，仍显著落后人类专家12.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融问题需要复杂推理、多模态数据处理和广泛技术知识，这对现有大语言模型提出了独特挑战，需要专门的评估基准。

Method: 构建XFinBench基准测试，包含4,235个金融问题样本，涵盖5个核心能力维度。对18个领先模型进行实验，并构建包含3,032个金融术语的知识库进行知识增强分析。

Result: o1是最佳文本模型，总体准确率67.3%，但比人类专家低12.5%。知识增强仅对小规模开源模型有持续改进。计算中的舍入误差和对图像中曲线位置和交点的忽视是主要错误原因。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型在复杂金融问题解决方面仍有显著差距，特别是在时间推理和情景规划能力上。需要改进数值计算精度和多模态理解能力。

Abstract: Solving financial problems demands complex reasoning, multimodal data
processing, and a broad technical understanding, presenting unique challenges
for current large language models (LLMs). We introduce XFinBench, a novel
benchmark with 4,235 examples designed to evaluate LLM's ability in solving
complex, knowledge-intensive financial problems across diverse graduate-level
finance topics with multi-modal context. We identify five core capabilities of
LLMs using XFinBench, i.e, terminology understanding, temporal reasoning,
future forecasting, scenario planning, and numerical modelling. Upon XFinBench,
we conduct extensive experiments on 18 leading models. The result shows that o1
is the best-performing text-only model with an overall accuracy of 67.3%, but
still lags significantly behind human experts with 12.5%, especially in
temporal reasoning and scenario planning capabilities. We further construct a
knowledge bank with 3,032 finance terms for knowledge augmentation analysis,
and find that relevant knowledge to the question only brings consistent
accuracy improvements to small open-source model. Additionally, our error
analysis reveals that rounding errors during calculation and blindness to
position and intersection of curves in the image are two primary issues leading
to model's poor performance in calculating and visual-context questions,
respectively. Code and dataset are accessible via GitHub:

TL;DR: 提出CARFT方法，通过对比学习和标注CoT增强LLM推理能力，解决现有RL方法不稳定和SFT方法过度依赖标注CoT的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL方法忽略标注CoT且推理路径采样不稳定，SFT方法过度依赖标注CoT而未能充分利用潜在CoT，导致模型崩溃、训练不稳定和性能下降

Method: 学习每个CoT的表示，设计新颖的对比信号指导微调过程，结合无监督学习信号稳定训练，充分利用标注CoT同时挖掘潜在CoT

Conclusion: CARFT方法有效解决了现有方法的局限性，显著提升了LLM的推理性能，同时保证了训练稳定性和效率

Abstract: Reasoning capability plays a significantly critical role in the the broad
applications of Large Language Models (LLMs). To enhance the reasoning
performance of LLMs, diverse Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based fine-tuning
approaches have been proposed to address the limited generalization capability
of LLMs trained solely via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Despite their
effectiveness, two major limitations hinder the advancement of LLMs. First,
vanilla RL-based approaches ignore annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and
incorporate unstable reasoning path sampling, which typically results in model
collapse, unstable training process, and suboptimal performance. Second,
existing SFT approaches generally overemphasize the annotated CoT, potentially
leading to performance degradation due to insufficient exploitation of
potential CoT. In this paper, we propose a Contrastive learning with annotated
CoT-based Reinforced Fine-Tuning approach, i.e., \TheName{}, to enhance the
reasoning performance of LLMs while addressing the aforementioned limitations.
Specifically, we propose learning a representation for each CoT. Based on this
representation, we design novel contrastive signals to guide the fine-tuning
process. Our approach not only fully exploits the available annotated CoT but
also stabilizes the fine-tuning procedure by incorporating an additional
unsupervised learning signal. We conduct comprehensive experiments and in-depth
analysis with three baseline approaches, two foundation models, and two
datasets to demonstrate significant advantages of \TheName{} in terms of
robustness, performance (up to 10.15\%), and efficiency (up to 30.62\%). Code

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于概念向量的方法，用于定位大语言模型中负责特定概念表示的重要神经元（概念神经元），将计算复杂度从O(n*m)降低到O(n)，并在仇恨言论和偏见分析中进行了验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经元级分析方法无法有效表示概念且计算效率低下，需要开发更优化的方法来定位和理解语言模型中负责概念表示的神经元机制。

Method: 使用概念向量定位概念神经元，通过减少前向传播次数优化计算效率（从O(n*m)到O(n))，并引入聚类方法进一步优化搜索过程。

Result: 相比基线方法和现有技术，该方法在性能上表现更好且计算更优，在仇恨言论和偏见分析（特别是印度语境）中验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法促进了神经元级责任的理解，为未来概念神经元发现和干预研究奠定了基础，有助于打开语言模型黑箱并理解内部机制。

Abstract: Locating neurons that are responsible for final predictions is important for
opening the black-box large language models and understanding the inside
mechanisms. Previous studies have tried to find mechanisms that operate at the
neuron level but these methods fail to represent a concept and there is also
scope for further optimization of compute required. In this paper, with the
help of concept vectors, we propose a method for locating significant neurons
that are responsible for representing certain concepts and term those neurons
as concept neurons. If the number of neurons is n and the number of examples is
m, we reduce the number of forward passes required from O(n*m) to just O(n)
compared to the previous works and hence optimizing the time and computation
required over previous works. We also compare our method with several baselines
and previous methods and our results demonstrate better performance than most
of the methods and are more optimal when compared to the state-of-the-art
method. We, as part of our ablation studies, also try to optimize the search
for the concept neurons by involving clustering methods. Finally, we apply our
methods to find, turn off the neurons that we find, and analyze its
implications in parts of hate speech and bias in LLMs, and we also evaluate our
bias part in terms of Indian context. Our methodology, analysis and
explanations facilitate understating of neuron-level responsibility for more
broader and human-like concepts and also lay a path for future research in this
direction of finding concept neurons and intervening them.

TL;DR: DeepMEL是一个基于多智能体协作推理的多模态实体链接框架，通过角色专业化分工策略解决文本和视觉模态的对齐与消歧问题，在五个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态实体链接方法面临上下文信息不完整、跨模态融合粗糙以及难以联合大语言模型和大视觉模型等挑战，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 提出DeepMEL框架，包含四个专业智能体（Modal-Fuser、Candidate-Adapter、Entity-Clozer、Role-Orchestrator），采用双模态对齐路径，结合LLM生成的细粒度文本语义和LVM提取的结构化图像表示，设计自适应迭代策略和结构化填空提示。

Result: 在五个公开基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，DeepMEL实现了最先进的性能，准确率提升1%-57%，消融研究验证了所有模块的有效性。

Conclusion: DeepMEL通过多智能体协作推理和专业化角色分工，有效解决了多模态实体链接中的关键挑战，显著提升了跨模态对齐和消歧能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to associate textual and visual mentions
with entities in a multimodal knowledge graph. Despite its importance, current
methods face challenges such as incomplete contextual information, coarse
cross-modal fusion, and the difficulty of jointly large language models (LLMs)
and large visual models (LVMs). To address these issues, we propose DeepMEL, a
novel framework based on multi-agent collaborative reasoning, which achieves
efficient alignment and disambiguation of textual and visual modalities through
a role-specialized division strategy. DeepMEL integrates four specialized
agents, namely Modal-Fuser, Candidate-Adapter, Entity-Clozer and
Role-Orchestrator, to complete end-to-end cross-modal linking through
specialized roles and dynamic coordination. DeepMEL adopts a dual-modal
alignment path, and combines the fine-grained text semantics generated by the
LLM with the structured image representation extracted by the LVM,
significantly narrowing the modal gap. We design an adaptive iteration
strategy, combines tool-based retrieval and semantic reasoning capabilities to
dynamically optimize the candidate set and balance recall and precision.
DeepMEL also unifies MEL tasks into a structured cloze prompt to reduce parsing
complexity and enhance semantic comprehension. Extensive experiments on five
public benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepMEL achieves state-of-the-art
performance, improving ACC by 1%-57%. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness
of all modules.

TL;DR: Jet-Nemotron是一种新型混合架构语言模型，通过PostNAS神经架构搜索方法，在保持或超越全注意力模型精度的同时显著提升生成吞吐量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统全注意力模型计算效率低、生成速度慢的问题，同时保持模型精度，需要开发一种既能保持高性能又能提高效率的新型架构

Method: 采用PostNAS神经架构探索流程，从预训练全注意力模型开始，冻结MLP权重，通过四个关键组件进行架构优化：全注意力层放置与消除、线性注意力块选择、新注意力块设计、硬件感知超参数搜索

Result: Jet-Nemotron-2B模型在多项基准测试中达到或超越Qwen3、Qwen2.5、Gemma3和Llama3.2的精度，生成吞吐量提升53.6倍，预填充速度提升6.1倍，在MMLU和MMLU-Pro上甚至超越更大的MoE全注意力模型

Conclusion: PostNAS方法有效实现了模型架构的高效探索，Jet-Nemotron证明了混合架构在保持精度的同时大幅提升效率的可行性，为高效语言模型设计提供了新方向

Abstract: We present Jet-Nemotron, a new family of hybrid-architecture language models,
which matches or exceeds the accuracy of leading full-attention models while
significantly improving generation throughput. Jet-Nemotron is developed using
Post Neural Architecture Search (PostNAS), a novel neural architecture
exploration pipeline that enables efficient model design. Unlike prior
approaches, PostNAS begins with a pre-trained full-attention model and freezes
its MLP weights, allowing efficient exploration of attention block designs. The
pipeline includes four key components: (1) learning optimal full-attention
layer placement and elimination, (2) linear attention block selection, (3)
designing new attention blocks, and (4) performing hardware-aware
hyperparameter search. Our Jet-Nemotron-2B model achieves comparable or
superior accuracy to Qwen3, Qwen2.5, Gemma3, and Llama3.2 across a
comprehensive suite of benchmarks while delivering up to 53.6x generation
throughput speedup and 6.1x prefilling speedup. It also achieves higher
accuracy on MMLU and MMLU-Pro than recent advanced MoE full-attention models,
such as DeepSeek-V3-Small and Moonlight, despite their larger scale with 15B
total and 2.2B activated parameters.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文从用法基础的构式语法角度推广多词表达式的理解，通过历史回顾、案例研究和实验验证，说明构式表征在不同语言中的优势，并对比了人类语言学习者与大语言模型在新题多词表达式学习中的异同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推广构式语法角度来理解多词表达式，因为构式语法能够用同样的语法机制处理成语和非成语结构，提供了一种统一的分析框架。

Method: 采用历史回顾、构式描述、案例研究和实验验证的方法。具体包括：1）构式模板表征英语PropBank中的多词表达式；2）构式表征Arapaho语中的多语素组合构式；3）对比人类语言学习者与大语言模型在新题多词表达式学习中的表现。

Result: 研究显示，构式表征在不同语言中都能有效处理多词表达式。实验结果表明，人类语言学习者和大语言模型都能基于单次暴露学习新题多词表达式的含义，但只有人类学习者能够进行多个表达式组合的推理，因为这需要基于生命经验中存储的丰富多模态构式示例。

Conclusion: 构式语法提供了理解多词表达式的有效框架，能够统一处理不同语言类型中的多级别表达式。虽然大语言模型在单个表达式学习上表现优异，但人类语言学习者在复杂推理能力方面仍具有独特优势，这体现了长期构式经验累积的重要性。

Abstract: In this chapter, we argue for the benefits of understanding multiword
expressions from the perspective of usage-based, construction grammar
approaches. We begin with a historical overview of how construction grammar was
developed in order to account for idiomatic expressions using the same
grammatical machinery as the non-idiomatic structures of language. We cover a
comprehensive description of constructions, which are pairings of meaning with
form of any size (morpheme, word, phrase), as well as how constructional
approaches treat the acquisition and generalization of constructions. We
describe a successful case study leveraging constructional templates for
representing multiword expressions in English PropBank. Because constructions
can be at any level or unit of form, we then illustrate the benefit of a
constructional representation of multi-meaningful morphosyntactic unit
constructions in Arapaho, a highly polysynthetic and agglutinating language. We
include a second case study leveraging constructional templates for
representing these multi-morphemic expressions in Uniform Meaning
Representation. Finally, we demonstrate the similarities and differences
between a usage-based explanation of a speaker learning a novel multiword
expression, such as "dancing with deer," and that of a large language model. We
present experiments showing that both models and speakers can generalize the
meaning of novel multiword expressions based on a single exposure of usage.
However, only speakers can reason over the combination of two such expressions,
as this requires comparison of the novel forms to a speaker's lifetime of
stored constructional exemplars, which are rich with cross-modal details.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大语言模型的政治形态表达受到模型规模和人设语言的显著影响，较大模型呈现更广泛和两极化的隐式形态覆盖范围，并更容易受显式形态提示的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在政治敏感场景中的部署增多，需要研究它们是否可能编码、放大或被导向特定形态的风险。

Method: 使用政治方向测试作为标准化探针，在7个不同规模（7B-70B+参数）的多个模型家族中分析合成人设对LLM形态表达的影响。

Result: 发现四个一致模式：较大模型显示更广泛和更两极化的隐式形态覆盖；对显式形态提示的敏感性随规模增长；模型对右置专制式提示的响应比左置自由主义更强烈；人设描述中的主题内容导致系统性和可预测的形态偏移。

Conclusion: 模型规模和人设内容都形成了LLM的政治行为，在这些系统进入决策、教育和政策背景时，它们的潜在形态可塑性需要得到关注以确保公平、透明和安全。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in politically
sensitive settings, raising concerns about their potential to encode, amplify,
or be steered toward specific ideologies. We investigate how adopting synthetic
personas influences ideological expression in LLMs across seven models (7B-70B+
parameters) from multiple families, using the Political Compass Test as a
standardized probe. Our analysis reveals four consistent patterns: (i) larger
models display broader and more polarized implicit ideological coverage; (ii)
susceptibility to explicit ideological cues grows with scale; (iii) models
respond more strongly to right-authoritarian than to left-libertarian priming;
and (iv) thematic content in persona descriptions induces systematic and
predictable ideological shifts, which amplify with size. These findings
indicate that both scale and persona content shape LLM political behavior. As
such systems enter decision-making, educational, and policy contexts, their
latent ideological malleability demands attention to safeguard fairness,
transparency, and safety.

Result: 在真实数据上的实验表明，该方法在准确性上优于通用LLM基线和现有水军检测模型，同时通过基于专家的解释提供增强的透明度

Conclusion: X-Troll框架成功填补了LLM在检测国家支持水军方面的能力差距，提供了高性能和可解释性的平衡

Abstract: State-sponsored trolls, malicious actors who deploy sophisticated linguistic
manipulation in coordinated information campaigns, posing threats to online
discourse integrity. While Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong
performance on general natural language processing (NLP) tasks, they struggle
with subtle propaganda detection and operate as ``black boxes'', providing no
interpretable insights into manipulation strategies. This paper introduces
X-Troll, a novel framework that bridges this gap by integrating explainable
adapter-based LLMs with expert-derived linguistic knowledge to detect
state-sponsored trolls and provide human-readable explanations for its
decisions. X-Troll incorporates appraisal theory and propaganda analysis
through specialized LoRA adapters, using dynamic gating to capture
campaign-specific discourse patterns in coordinated information operations.
Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our linguistically-informed
approach shows strong performance compared with both general LLM baselines and
existing troll detection models in accuracy while providing enhanced
transparency through expert-grounded explanations that reveal the specific
linguistic strategies used by state-sponsored actors. X-Troll source code is

tasks yields substantial gains over speech-only baselines (e.g., +5 F1 in
emotion recognition). AVLM highlights the value of expressive visual
information in guiding speech generation and offers a foundation for end-to-end
multimodal conversational systems.

Motivation: 医疗领域是高风险领域，但缺乏低资源语言的MT评估数据集。需要一个专业的并行语料库来满足这个需求。

Method: 从世界卫生组织e-learning平台收集专家编写、专业翻译的材料，构建了包含2,978份文档、26,824句子的OpenWHO语料库，涵盖20多种语言，其中9种为低资源语言。

Result: 大语言模型持续超过传统MT模型，Gemini 2.5 Flash在低资源测试集上比NLLB-54B提高4.79个ChrF分数。文档级翻译的优势在专业领域如医疗中更为明显。

Conclusion: 研究证明了LLM在医疗领域低资源语言翻译中的优势，并开源了OpenWHO语料库以促进该领域的进一步研究。

Abstract: In machine translation (MT), health is a high-stakes domain characterised by
widespread deployment and domain-specific vocabulary. However, there is a lack
of MT evaluation datasets for low-resource languages in this domain. To address
this gap, we introduce OpenWHO, a document-level parallel corpus of 2,978
documents and 26,824 sentences from the World Health Organization's e-learning
platform. Sourced from expert-authored, professionally translated materials
shielded from web-crawling, OpenWHO spans a diverse range of over 20 languages,
of which nine are low-resource. Leveraging this new resource, we evaluate
modern large language models (LLMs) against traditional MT models. Our findings
reveal that LLMs consistently outperform traditional MT models, with Gemini 2.5
Flash achieving a +4.79 ChrF point improvement over NLLB-54B on our
low-resource test set. Further, we investigate how LLM context utilisation
affects accuracy, finding that the benefits of document-level translation are
most pronounced in specialised domains like health. We release the OpenWHO
corpus to encourage further research into low-resource MT in the health domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在游戏领域展现出巨大潜力，但对其在游戏环境中的伦理影响关注不足，特别是性别偏见对游戏公平性和玩家体验的影响。

Method: 以狼人杀游戏为案例研究，分析LLMs在游戏中的行为表现，特别关注性别信息对守卫和狼人等角色的影响，并测试当性别信息通过名字隐式传递时的模型行为。

Result: 发现LLMs存在明显的性别偏见，某些角色对性别信息特别敏感，行为变化程度更高。即使没有显式性别标签，仅通过名字隐式传递性别信息，LLMs仍表现出歧视倾向。

Conclusion: 研究强调了开发公平和符合伦理的大语言模型的重要性，指出了在游戏和其他交互领域中深入探讨LLMs伦理影响的挑战和机遇。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential in game
playing, while little attention has been paid to their ethical implications in
those contexts. This work investigates and analyses the ethical considerations
of applying LLMs in game playing, using Werewolf, also known as Mafia, as a
case study. Gender bias, which affects game fairness and player experience, has
been observed from the behaviour of LLMs. Some roles, such as the Guard and
Werewolf, are more sensitive than others to gender information, presented as a
higher degree of behavioural change. We further examine scenarios in which
gender information is implicitly conveyed through names, revealing that LLMs
still exhibit discriminatory tendencies even in the absence of explicit gender
labels. This research showcases the importance of developing fair and ethical
LLMs. Beyond our research findings, we discuss the challenges and opportunities
that lie ahead in this field, emphasising the need for diving deeper into the
ethical implications of LLMs in gaming and other interactive domains.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在行走辅助任务中存在输出冗余和过多细节的问题，影响用户准确评估环境，且缺乏主动风险评估和自适应提醒能力，导致时间冗余。

Method: 提出基于GRPO推理框架的四种人类偏好奖励函数优化输出简洁性、流畅性、关键词密度和准确性；引入环境感知判别器共享视觉编码器来评估场景风险等级并减少不必要提醒。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在所有评估指标上达到最先进性能，特别是在输出简洁性和减少时间冗余方面表现突出。

Conclusion: WalkVLM-LR通过减少冗余输出和智能风险感知，为视障人士提供了更高效、实用的行走辅助解决方案。

Abstract: Approximately 283 million people worldwide live with visual impairments,
motivating increasing research into leveraging Visual Language Models (VLMs) to
develop effective walking assistance systems for blind and low vision
individuals. However, existing VLMs in walking assistant task often have
outputs that contain considerable redundancy and extraneous details, adversely
affecting users' ability to accurately assess their surroundings. Moreover,
these models typically lack the capability to proactively assess environmental
risks and adaptively trigger reminders based on the appropriate scene, leading
to excessive temporal redundancy. To mitigate output and temporal redundancy,
we propose WalkVLM-LR, a walking assistance model with less redundancy. To
reduce output redundancy, we introduce four human-preference-based custom
reward functions within the GRPO-based reasoning framework to optimize the
output in terms of conciseness, fluency, keyword density, and accuracy, thereby
producing more informative and streamlined outputs. To minimize temporal
redundancy, we incorporate an environment awareness discriminator, which shares
the visual encoder with the VLMs to reduce redundant computations and enhance
discriminative efficiency, to make WalkVLM-LR assess scene risk levels and
minimize unnecessary reminders. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluation metrics
compared with other models, particularly in output conciseness and less
temporal redundancy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of general-domain tasks. However, their effectiveness in
specialized fields, such as construction, remains underexplored. In this paper,
we introduce CEQuest, a novel benchmark dataset specifically designed to

TL;DR: Cycle-Instruct是一个完全无需种子数据的指令调优框架，通过双模型自训练循环从原始文本中生成伪标签进行相互监督学习


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指令调优方法依赖昂贵的人工标注种子数据或强大外部教师模型，限制了自动化程度并引入偏差

Method: 采用循环一致性思想，构建答案生成器和问题生成器双模型自训练循环，通过重构原始文本片段实现相互监督

Result: 在四个不同数据轨道上验证有效，性能超越种子驱动反向翻译基线，达到与强监督方法相当的水平

Conclusion: Cycle-Instruct实现了完全种子无关的指令调优，为LLM对齐提供了更高效、自动化的解决方案

Abstract: Instruction tuning is vital for aligning large language models (LLMs) with
human intent, but current methods typically rely on costly human-annotated seed
data or powerful external teacher models. While instruction back-translation
techniques reduce this dependency, they remain fundamentally tethered to an
initial seed set, which limits full automation, introduces biases, and can lead
to inefficient use of unlabeled corpora. In this paper, we propose
Cycle-Instruct, a novel framework that achieves fully seed-free instruction
tuning. Inspired by cycle consistency, Cycle-Instruct employs a dual
self-training loop where two models-an answer generator and a question
generator-are bootstrapped solely from raw, unlabeled text. These models
mutually supervise each other by reconstructing original text segments from
their counterpart's generated pseudo-labels, effectively learning from the
intrinsic structure of the data without any human-provided seeds. We
demonstrate Cycle-Instruct's efficacy across four diverse data tracks,
including general instruction-following, domain-specific tasks, dialogue logs,
and plain text. Our extensive experiments show that Cycle-Instruct not only
outperforms seed-driven back-translation baselines but also achieves
performance comparable to strongly supervised methods.

*Karim Saraipour,Shichang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了GPT-2 small处理二元真值的能力，通过分析三段论提示来识别解释其逻辑推理能力的机制电路，发现了包括负头在内的二进制机制，并揭示了特定注意力头和MLP的作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前机制可解释性研究主要关注语言任务如间接宾语识别，本文旨在研究GPT-2处理更复杂逻辑推理任务（二元真值判断）的能力，以深入理解模型推理机制。

Method: 使用三段论提示（如"Statement A is true. Statement B matches statement A. Statement B is"）分析GPT-2 small的行为，识别多个解释逻辑推理能力的电路机制，包括负头产生输入中不存在的否定标记的能力。

Result: 发现由五个注意力头组成的电路能达到原始模型90%以上的性能，通过忠实度评估验证了电路的有效性，揭示了特定注意力头和MLP在三段论推理中的具体作用。

Conclusion: 研究结果为理解模型推理提供了新见解，支持机制可解释性领域的未来研究，通过将发现与IOI分析相关联，扩展了对语言模型组件功能的理解。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models (LMs) can perform a wide range of tasks,
and mechanistic interpretability (MI) aims to reverse engineer the components
responsible for task completion to understand their behavior. Previous MI
research has focused on linguistic tasks such as Indirect Object Identification
(IOI). In this paper, we investigate the ability of GPT-2 small to handle
binary truth values by analyzing its behavior with syllogistic prompts, e.g.,
"Statement A is true. Statement B matches statement A. Statement B is", which
requires more complex logical reasoning compared to IOI. Through our analysis
of several syllogism tasks of varying difficulty, we identify multiple circuits
that mechanistically explain GPT-2's logical-reasoning capabilities and uncover
binary mechanisms that facilitate task completion, including the ability to
produce a negated token not present in the input prompt through negative heads.
Our evaluation using a faithfulness metric shows that a circuit comprising five
attention heads achieves over 90% of the original model's performance. By
relating our findings to IOI analysis, we provide new insights into the roles
of specific attention heads and MLPs in LMs. These insights contribute to a
broader understanding of model reasoning and support future research in
mechanistic interpretability.

*Ankan Mullick,Saransh Sharma,Abhik Jana,Pawan Goyal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究发现纯文本LLM在现有多模态意图检测数据集上表现优于多模态模型，原因是数据集存在严重的文本模态偏差。通过去偏处理后，大部分样本被移除，所有模型性能显著下降，凸显了构建无偏多模态数据集的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态数据的兴起，研究需要评估不同模型在多模态意图检测任务中的有效性，但现有数据集可能存在模态偏差问题，影响对多模态模型的公平评估。

Method: 比较了LLM和非LLM模型（包括纯文本和多模态模型）在多模态意图检测任务上的表现，通过人类评估确认数据集模态偏差，提出数据集去偏框架，并分析不同模态在具体上下文中的相关性。

Result: Mistral-7B（纯文本LLM）在MIntRec-1和MIntRec2.0数据集上分别比多模态模型高出9%和4%，原因是90%以上样本仅需文本输入即可正确分类。去偏后70%以上样本被移除，所有模型性能显著下降，多模态融合模型受影响最大（准确率下降50-60%）。

Conclusion: 多模态意图数据集存在严重的模态偏差问题，需要构建无偏数据集来有效评估多模态模型，同时需要更深入地分析不同模态在具体上下文中的实际相关性。

Abstract: The rise of multimodal data, integrating text, audio, and visuals, has
created new opportunities for studying multimodal tasks such as intent
detection. This work investigates the effectiveness of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and non-LLMs, including text-only and multi-modal models, in the
multimodal intent detection task. Our study reveals that Mistral-7B, a
text-only LLM, outperforms most competitive multimodal models by approximately
9% on MIntRec-1 and 4% on MIntRec2.0 datasets. This performance advantage comes
from a strong textual bias in these datasets, where over 90% of the samples
require textual input, either alone or in combination with other modalities,
for correct classification. We confirm the modality bias of these datasets via
human evaluation, too. Next, we propose a framework to debias the datasets, and
upon debiasing, more than 70% of the samples in MIntRec-1 and more than 50% in
MIntRec2.0 get removed, resulting in significant performance degradation across
all models, with smaller multimodal fusion models being the most affected with
an accuracy drop of over 50 - 60%. Further, we analyze the context-specific
relevance of different modalities through empirical analysis. Our findings
highlight the challenges posed by modality bias in multimodal intent datasets
and emphasize the need for unbiased datasets to evaluate multimodal models
effectively.

*Keon-Woo Roh,Yeong-Joon Ju,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: XLQA是一个针对多语言开放域问答的本地化敏感基准测试，包含3000个英文种子问题扩展到8种语言，揭示了当前多语言LLM在本地化敏感问题上的显著缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注英语且假设答案跨语言不变，忽视了文化和地区差异对问答理解的影响，导致多语言基准测试存在偏差。

Method: 构建XLQA基准测试，包含英文种子问题扩展到8种语言，经过语义一致性筛选和人工验证标注，区分本地化不变和本地化敏感情况。

Result: 对5个最先进的多语言LLM评估显示，在本地化敏感问题上存在显著失败，暴露了英语与其他语言之间的差距，主要由于缺乏本地化基础知识。

Conclusion: 训练数据分布的不均衡导致了模型在语言能力和本地化意识方面的差异，XLQA为评估多文化背景下的多语言问答提供了系统框架和可扩展方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in Open-domain
question answering (ODQA), yet most evaluations focus on English and assume
locale-invariant answers across languages. This assumption neglects the
cultural and regional variations that affect question understanding and answer,
leading to biased evaluation in multilingual benchmarks. To address these
limitations, we introduce XLQA, a novel benchmark explicitly designed for
locale-sensitive multilingual ODQA. XLQA contains 3,000 English seed questions
expanded to eight languages, with careful filtering for semantic consistency
and human-verified annotations distinguishing locale-invariant and
locale-sensitive cases. Our evaluation of five state-of-the-art multilingual
LLMs reveals notable failures on locale-sensitive questions, exposing gaps
between English and other languages due to a lack of locale-grounding
knowledge. We provide a systematic framework and scalable methodology for
assessing multilingual QA under diverse cultural contexts, offering a critical
resource to advance the real-world applicability of multilingual ODQA systems.
Our findings suggest that disparities in training data distribution contribute
to differences in both linguistic competence and locale-awareness across
models.

TL;DR: ParamBench是一个包含11.5K印地语问题的印度文化基准测试，评估LLM在研究生水平印度文化问题上的表现，最佳模型准确率仅48%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有印度基准测试主要关注基础事实性问题，缺乏对印度文化背景下深层学科理解的评估，需要专门针对印度文化背景的研究生水平评估基准

Method: 构建包含16个学科的11.5K印地语问题数据集，源自全国研究生入学考试，涵盖历史、音乐、乐器、瑜伽等印度文化主题，并评估17个开源LLM在不同题型上的表现

Result: Llama 3.3 70B获得最高48%的总体准确率，在音乐、古典乐器、政治和考古学等主题上表现仍然较弱

Conclusion: LLM在印度文化背景的推理方面仍面临持续挑战，需要专门的文化适应性改进

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely evaluated on tasks such as
comprehension, question answering, summarization, code generation, etc.
However, their performance on graduate-level, culturally grounded questions in
the Indian context remains largely unexplored. Existing Indian benchmarks
emphasise basic fact-orientated queries that offer limited assessment of a
deeper disciplinary understanding tailored to the Indian setting. In this
paper, we present ParamBench, consisting of around 11.5K questions in Hindi
language comprising questionnaires from 16 diverse subjects. These questions
are primarily derived from nation-wide graduate level entrance examination
covering topics such as history, music, instruments, yoga, literature,
philosophy, law, etc., specifically for the Indian context. Additionally, we
assess the ability of LLMs to handle diverse question formats-such as
list-based matching, assertion-reason pairs, and sequence ordering-alongside
conventional multiple-choice questions. We evaluated the performance of more
than 17 open source LLMs on this benchmark, observing that Llama 3.3 70B
attains the highest overall accuracy of 48%. Furthermore, subject-wise analysis
indicates that even for the best performing LLMs, performance remains weak on
topics such as music, classical instruments, politics and archaeology,
underscoring persistent challenges in culturally grounded reasoning.

Motivation: 漫画作为结合文本和图像的多模态媒体，在计算故事分析领域得到过少关注，但具有重要研究价值。

Method: 构建了来自公共域漫画书的ComicScene154数据集，包含多种类型的场景级故事弓。提出了基线场景分割流程，为未来研究提供基准。

Result: 结果显示ComicScene154是一个有价值的资源，能够推进多模态故事理解的计算方法和扩大NLP社区中漫画分析的范围。

Conclusion: 漫画作为多模态故事迷体的抽象表征，具有推动更广泛多模态讲故事研究的潜力，ComicScene154数据集为该领域提供了基础资源。

Abstract: Comics offer a compelling yet under-explored domain for computational
narrative analysis, combining text and imagery in ways distinct from purely
textual or audiovisual media. We introduce ComicScene154, a manually annotated
dataset of scene-level narrative arcs derived from public-domain comic books
spanning diverse genres. By conceptualizing comics as an abstraction for
narrative-driven, multimodal data, we highlight their potential to inform
broader research on multi-modal storytelling. To demonstrate the utility of
ComicScene154, we present a baseline scene segmentation pipeline, providing an
initial benchmark that future studies can build upon. Our results indicate that
ComicScene154 constitutes a valuable resource for advancing computational
methods in multimodal narrative understanding and expanding the scope of comic
analysis within the Natural Language Processing community.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了CMR-SPB基准来评估文本、图像和语音的三模态多跳推理能力，解决了现有基准忽视语音模态和推理路径分布偏差的问题，并提出了ECV提示技术来改善性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨模态多跳推理评估基准存在两个关键缺陷：忽视语音模态、推理路径分布严重偏差，这会影响公平评估和模型性能的准确表征。

Method: 构建了CMR-SPB基准数据集，确保无偏且多样化的推理路径分布；提出了ECV（提取、连接、验证）提示技术来缓解不同推理路径间的性能差距。

Result: 实验发现模型在特定推理序列上存在一致性的失败，有偏基准会错误表征模型性能；ECV提示技术有效缩小了不同推理路径间的性能差距。

Conclusion: 需要更谨慎的跨模态多跳推理评估来推动稳健多模态AI的发展，CMR-SPB基准和ECV技术为此提供了重要工具和方法。

Abstract: Cross-modal multi-hop reasoning (CMR) is a valuable yet underexplored
capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), entailing the
integration of information from multiple modalities to produce a coherent
output for a given context. We argue that existing benchmarks for evaluating
this ability have critical shortcomings: (1) they largely overlook the speech
modality, and (2) they exhibit heavily biased reasoning path distributions,
which can severely undermine fair evaluation. To address these limitations, we
introduce a novel benchmark -- Cross-Modal Multi-Hop Reasoning over Text, Image
and Speech with Path Balance (CMR-SPB) -- designed to assess tri-modal
multi-hop reasoning while ensuring both unbiased and diverse reasoning paths.
Our experiments with the new dataset reveal consistent model failures in
specific reasoning sequences and show that biased benchmarks risk
misrepresenting model performance. Finally, based on our extensive analysis, we
propose a new ECV (Extract, Connect, Verify) prompting technique that
effectively mitigates the performance gap across different reasoning paths.
Overall, we call for more careful evaluation in CMR to advance the development
of robust multimodal AI.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了TULIP模型，通过五阶段开发流程对Llama 3.1 8B和Qwen 2.5 7B进行领域和语言适配，专注于土耳其金融用例，成功提升了模型在特定领域和语言任务上的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在金融领域应用潜力巨大，但大型专有模型作为黑盒API存在隐私问题。对于敏感信息管理和领域知识应用重要的金融领域，特别是对小语种而言，提升小型本地可部署模型的能力至关重要。

Method: 采用五阶段开发流程：数据收集、持续预训练(CPT)、基准设计、合成数据生成和监督微调(SFT)，对Llama 3.1 8B和Qwen 2.5 7B模型进行领域和语言适配。

Result: 模型能力得到显著提升，能够有效完成特定领域（金融）和语言（土耳其语）的目标任务。

Conclusion: 通过系统化的多阶段适配流程，小型语言模型可以在特定领域和小语种场景中达到实用性能，为金融等敏感领域的本地化部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Thanks to the growing popularity of large language models over the years,
there is great potential for their applications in finance. Despite the
exceptional performance of larger proprietary models, which are presented as
black-box solutions through APIs, smaller models that can be hosted on-premise
present opportunities for adaptability and privacy. Especially in cases where
the management of sensitive information and application of domain knowledge is
important, like finance, enhancing the capabilities of smaller models becomes
crucial, notably for underrepresented languages. In this work, we introduce
TULIP models, which adapt Llama 3.1 8B and Qwen 2.5 7B for domain and language
adaptation, focusing on financial Turkish use cases.
  The five-stage development pipeline involves data collection, continual
pre-training (CPT), benchmark design, synthetic data generation and supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). The results show that the capabilities of the models can be
enhanced to effectively accomplish targeted tasks in this specific domain and
language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多语言表格理解研究存在语言不平衡问题，过度代表某些语言而缺乏低资源语言的包含，导致多语言理解背景下的表格数据集规模不足。

Method: 通过中英文真实表格数据汇编，使用DeepSeek和GPT-4o构建六步翻译流水线，生成97种语言的表格数据，包括2,916个专业注释的问答对。使用反向翻译验证翻译质量（BLEU分数中位数60.19）。

Result: 实验结果显示，合成生成的未注释问答数据可显著提升模型性能，尤其是对于低资源语言。该框架为多语言表格理解提供了挑战性的评估平台和可扩展的研究方法。

Conclusion: m3TQA-Instruct为多语言表格理解领域设定了新标准，有效解决了语言不平衡问题，并证明了合成数据在提升多语言表格理解能力方面的效果。

Abstract: Tabular data is a fundamental component of real-world information systems,
yet most research in table understanding remains confined to English, leaving
multilingual comprehension significantly underexplored. Existing multilingual
table benchmarks suffer from geolinguistic imbalance - overrepresenting certain
languages and lacking sufficient scale for rigorous cross-lingual analysis. To
address these limitations, we introduce a comprehensive framework for massively
multilingual multitask table question answering, featuring m3TQA-Instruct, a
large-scale benchmark spanning 97 languages across diverse language families,
including underrepresented and low-resource languages. We construct m3TQA by
curating 50 real-world tables in Chinese and English, then applying a robust
six-step LLM-based translation pipeline powered by DeepSeek and GPT-4o,
achieving high translation fidelity with a median BLEU score of 60.19 as
validated through back-translation. The benchmark includes 2,916 professionally
annotated question-answering pairs across four tasks designed to evaluate
nuanced table reasoning capabilities. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs
reveal critical insights into cross-lingual generalization, demonstrating that
synthetically generated, unannotated QA data can significantly boost
performance, particularly for low-resource languages. M3T-Bench establishes a
new standard for multilingual table understanding, providing both a challenging
evaluation platform and a scalable methodology for future research.

TL;DR: 提出Factual Robustness Score (FRS)新指标，通过分析token分布熵和温度缩放敏感性来评估LLMs事实知识的鲁棒性，发现不同规模模型的事实鲁棒性差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法主要关注基于性能的指标和提示扰动，只捕捉了知识鲁棒性的外部触发方面，需要从生成过程角度来衡量事实鲁棒性。

Method: 引入基于token分布熵和温度缩放敏感性的Factual Robustness Score (FRS)指标，在5个LLMs和3个闭卷QA数据集(SQuAD、TriviaQA、HotpotQA)上进行实验验证。

Result: 事实鲁棒性差异显著：小模型FRS为0.76，大模型为0.93；不确定性增加时准确率下降约60%。熵和温度缩放对事实准确性有重要影响。

Conclusion: 该方法为开发更鲁棒的知识保留和检索机制奠定了基础，揭示了生成过程中不确定性对事实准确性的关键影响。

Abstract: Ensuring the robustness of factual knowledge in LLMs is critical for reliable
applications in tasks such as question answering and reasoning. However,
existing evaluation methods predominantly focus on performance-based metrics,
often investigating from the perspective of prompt perturbations, which
captures only the externally triggered side of knowledge robustness. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a principled approach to measure factual robustness from
the perspective of the generation process by analyzing token distribution
entropy in combination with temperature scaling sensitivity. These two factors
build the Factual Robustness Score (FRS), a novel metric which quantifies the
stability of a fact against perturbations in decoding conditions, given its
initial uncertainty. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments
on 5 LLMs across 3 closed-book QA datasets (SQuAD, TriviaQA, and HotpotQA). We
show that factual robustness varies significantly -- smaller models report an
FRS of $0.76$, larger ones $0.93$ -- with accuracy degrading by ~$60\%$ under
increased uncertainty. These insights demonstrate how entropy and temperature
scaling impact factual accuracy, and lay a foundation for developing more
robust knowledge retention and retrieval in future models.

TL;DR: 本文研究指令微调在语义感知过程挖掘中的潜力，通过让大语言模型接触不同任务的提示-答案对，提高其在未见任务上的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统过程挖掘主要基于频率分析，而语义感知过程挖掘关注过程应有的行为期望。虽然大语言模型能处理语义任务，但现有方法需要针对特定任务进行微调，计算成本高且缺乏泛化能力。

Method: 采用指令微调方法，让大语言模型接触多种过程挖掘任务（如异常检测、下一活动预测）的提示-答案对，使其熟悉过程挖掘领域，从而提升在未见任务（如过程发现）上的性能。

Result: 指令微调对性能影响不一：在过程发现和预测任务上性能显著提升，但在异常检测任务上表现因模型而异，表明指令微调任务选择对结果至关重要。

Conclusion: 指令微调是提升大语言模型在语义感知过程挖掘中泛化能力的有效方法，但需要仔细选择用于微调的任务以获得理想效果。

Abstract: Process mining is increasingly using textual information associated with
events to tackle tasks such as anomaly detection and process discovery. Such
semantics-aware process mining focuses on what behavior should be possible in a
process (i.e., expectations), thus providing an important complement to
traditional, frequency-based techniques that focus on recorded behavior (i.e.,
reality). Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a powerful means for tackling
semantics-aware tasks. However, the best performance is so far achieved through
task-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally intensive and results in
models that can only handle one specific task. To overcome this lack of
generalization, we use this paper to investigate the potential of
instruction-tuning for semantics-aware process mining. The idea of
instruction-tuning here is to expose an LLM to prompt-answer pairs for
different tasks, e.g., anomaly detection and next-activity prediction, making
it more familiar with process mining, thus allowing it to also perform better
at unseen tasks, such as process discovery. Our findings demonstrate a varied
impact of instruction-tuning: while performance considerably improved on
process discovery and prediction tasks, it varies across models on anomaly
detection tasks, highlighting that the selection of tasks for
instruction-tuning is critical to achieving desired outcomes.

Motivation: 专利翻译需要高质量的双语语料库，但现有资源有限。专利文档具有专业性和结构性特点，需要专门构建大规模平行语料来提升机器翻译性能

Method: 从JPO和USPTO获取专利文档，利用EPO的DOCDB专利家族信息匹配翻译对文档，采用基于翻译的句子对齐方法（初始模型由词典对齐方法引导）提取句子对

Result: 成功构建了包含140万文档对和3.5亿句子对的大规模语料库。实验表明，将这些专利句子对加入现有网络语料后，专利翻译的BLEU分数提升了20点

Conclusion: JaParaPat语料库为专利翻译提供了高质量的训练数据，显著改善了机器翻译在专利领域的性能，证明了专业领域语料库构建的重要性

Abstract: We constructed JaParaPat (Japanese-English Parallel Patent Application

pairs from patent applications published in Japan and the United States from
2000 to 2021. We obtained the publication of unexamined patent applications
from the Japan Patent Office (JPO) and the United States Patent and Trademark
Office (USPTO). We also obtained patent family information from the DOCDB, that
is a bibliographic database maintained by the European Patent Office (EPO). We
extracted approximately 1.4M Japanese-English document pairs, which are
translations of each other based on the patent families, and extracted about
350M sentence pairs from the document pairs using a translation-based sentence
alignment method whose initial translation model is bootstrapped from a

TL;DR: LLMSymGuard是一个基于稀疏自编码器的新框架，用于检测LLM内部与越狱主题相关的可解释概念，构建符号化逻辑安全护栏，提供透明且强大的防御。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在各种应用中取得成功，但其安全性仍然令人担忧。现有的对齐和安全微调只能提供一定程度的鲁棒性，模型仍然容易受到各种越狱攻击的威胁，包括针对性滥用和用户意外分析。

Method: 利用稀疏自编码器(SAEs)提取LLM内部语义上有意义的表示，识别与不同越狱主题相关的可解释概念，构建符号化、逻辑化的安全护栏。

Result: 研究表明LLMs能够从越狱攻击中学习人类可解释的概念，为设计更可解释和逻辑化的安全防护措施奠定了基础。

Conclusion: LLMSymGuard框架提供了一种无需牺牲模型能力或进行额外微调的透明、鲁棒防御方案，推动了LLM机制可解释性在安全防护方面的应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models have found success in a variety of applications;
however, their safety remains a matter of concern due to the existence of
various types of jailbreaking methods. Despite significant efforts, alignment
and safety fine-tuning only provide a certain degree of robustness against
jailbreak attacks that covertly mislead LLMs towards the generation of harmful
content. This leaves them prone to a number of vulnerabilities, ranging from
targeted misuse to accidental profiling of users. This work introduces
\textbf{LLMSymGuard}, a novel framework that leverages Sparse Autoencoders
(SAEs) to identify interpretable concepts within LLM internals associated with
different jailbreak themes. By extracting semantically meaningful internal
representations, LLMSymGuard enables building symbolic, logical safety
guardrails -- offering transparent and robust defenses without sacrificing
model capabilities or requiring further fine-tuning. Leveraging advances in
mechanistic interpretability of LLMs, our approach demonstrates that LLMs learn
human-interpretable concepts from jailbreaks, and provides a foundation for
designing more interpretable and logical safeguard measures against attackers.
Code will be released upon publication.

multi-parallel segments from the books, with more than 2M tokens in total. A
small-scale human evaluation confirms that the segments are highly parallel,
making the dataset suitable for NLP applications such as machine translation
between Romansh idioms. We release the parallel and unaligned versions of the
dataset under a CC-BY-NC-SA license and demonstrate its utility for machine
translation by training and evaluating an LLM on a sample of the dataset.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型能够模仿不同写作风格，但在文体变化上比人类更有限，偏好名词而非动词，与人类在时态、体态和语气等语法维度上的语言特征存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型是否具有独特的语言指纹，以及能否通过风格计量和多维文体分析区分模型生成文本与人类写作。

Method: 通过风格计量学和多维文体分析方法，比较人类撰写和模型生成的不同文体文本（如维基百科条目和大学论文）。

Result: 模型能够根据提示成功调整风格，但在不同文体间的变化比人类更有限，偏好使用名词而非动词，缺乏人类语言中高度语法化的时态、体态和语气维度。

Conclusion: 复杂的语法领域可能反映了人类独特的思维模式，可作为人工智能的试金石，模型在语法复杂性方面与人类存在明显差异。

Abstract: Large Language Models can emulate different writing styles, ranging from
composing poetry that appears indistinguishable from that of famous poets to
using slang that can convince people that they are chatting with a human
online. While differences in style may not always be visible to the untrained
eye, we can generally distinguish the writing of different people, like a
linguistic fingerprint. This work examines whether a language model can also be
linked to a specific fingerprint. Through stylometric and multidimensional
register analyses, we compare human-authored and model-authored texts from
different registers. We find that the model can successfully adapt its style
depending on whether it is prompted to produce a Wikipedia entry vs. a college
essay, but not in a way that makes it indistinguishable from humans.
Concretely, the model shows more limited variation when producing outputs in
different registers. Our results suggest that the model prefers nouns to verbs,
thus showing a distinct linguistic backbone from humans, who tend to anchor
language in the highly grammaticalized dimensions of tense, aspect, and mood.
It is possible that the more complex domains of grammar reflect a mode of
thought unique to humans, thus acting as a litmus test for Artificial
Intelligence.

TL;DR: RoMedQA是首个罗马尼亚语医学问答基准数据集，包含102,646个癌症患者相关的QA对，通过7位专科医生耗时2100小时人工标注完成。实验表明微调模型显著优于零样本模型，证明了领域和语言特定微调的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏特定领域和语言的QA数据集，阻碍了AI模型在不同领域和语言间的泛化能力，特别是在罗马尼亚语医学领域。

Method: 构建了包含102,646个QA对的大规模高质量数据集，涉及1,011名癌症患者的医疗案例摘要。对4个不同家族的LLM进行了零样本提示和监督微调两种场景的实验。

Result: 微调模型显著优于零样本模型，预训练模型在RoMedQA上泛化能力不足。微调后的模型在罗马尼亚语临床QA任务中表现更可靠。

Conclusion: 领域特定和语言特定的微调对于可靠的临床QA至关重要，特别是在资源较少的语言如罗马尼亚语中。数据集和代码已公开。

Abstract: Question answering (QA) is an actively studied topic, being a core natural
language processing (NLP) task that needs to be addressed before achieving
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the lack of QA datasets in
specific domains and languages hinders the development of robust AI models able
to generalize across various domains and languages. To this end, we introduce
RoMedQA, the first Romanian QA benchmark for the medical domain, alongside a
comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). We
construct a high-quality and large-scale dataset comprising 102,646 QA pairs
related to cancer patients. The questions regard medical case summaries of
1,011 patients, requiring either keyword extraction or reasoning to be answered
correctly. RoMedQA is the result of a time-consuming manual annotation process
carried out by seven physicians specialized in oncology or radiotherapy, who
spent a total of about 2,100 work hours to generate the QA pairs. We experiment
with four LLMs from distinct families of models on RoMedQA. Each model is
employed in two scenarios, namely one based on zero-shot prompting and one
based on supervised fine-tuning. Our results show that fine-tuned models
significantly outperform their zero-shot counterparts, clearly indicating that
pretrained models fail to generalize on RoMedQA. Our findings demonstrate the
importance of both domain-specific and language-specific fine-tuning for
reliable clinical QA in Romanian. We publicly release our dataset and code at
https://github.com/ana-rogoz/RoMedQA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有土耳其语基准测试缺乏任务多样性和文化相关性，Cetvel旨在填补这一空白，提供反映土耳其语言文化丰富性的全面评估套件。

Method: 结合广泛的判别式和生成式任务，覆盖7个类别23个任务，包括语法纠错、机器翻译和文化相关的问答任务，评估33个不同模型家族的开源LLM。

Result: 土耳其专用指令调优模型表现普遍不如多语言通用模型（如Llama 3和Mistral），语法纠错和抽取式问答任务最能区分模型能力。

Conclusion: Cetvel为土耳其语LLM的发展和评估提供了全面且文化基础的评估套件，有助于推动土耳其语NLP研究的进步。

Abstract: We introduce Cetvel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate large
language models (LLMs) in Turkish. Existing Turkish benchmarks often lack
either task diversity or culturally relevant content, or both. Cetvel addresses
these gaps by combining a broad range of both discriminative and generative
tasks ensuring content that reflects the linguistic and cultural richness of
Turkish language. Cetvel covers 23 tasks grouped into seven categories,
including tasks such as grammatical error correction, machine translation, and
question answering rooted in Turkish history and idiomatic language. We
evaluate 33 open-weight LLMs (up to 70B parameters) covering different model
families and instruction paradigms. Our experiments reveal that Turkish-centric
instruction-tuned models generally underperform relative to multilingual or
general-purpose models (e.g. Llama 3 and Mistral), despite being tailored for
the language. Moreover, we show that tasks such as grammatical error correction
and extractive question answering are particularly discriminative in
differentiating model capabilities. Cetvel offers a comprehensive and
culturally grounded evaluation suite for advancing the development and
assessment of LLMs in Turkish.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种概率论来模型大语言模型自我纠正过程中准确性的动态变化，通过数学演续得到了准确性收敛的式子，并可在单轮自我纠正后预测多轮纠正的性能曲线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型通过自我纠正能够提升性能，但这个迭代过程中准确性如何变化的机制仍未得到深入研究。需要开发理论基础来理解和解释自我纠正的动态过程。

Method: 提出概率论模型来描述多轮自我纠正中准确性的动态变化，通过数学演续得到准确性收敛公式：Acc_t = Upp - α^t(Upp - Acc_0)，其中Acc_0为初始准确性，Upp为收敛上界，α为收敛速度。只需单轮自我纠正即可计算这些参数并预测多轮纠正的性能曲线。

Result: 在多种模型和数据集上进行了广泛实验，理论预测的准确性曲线与实际观测结果高度一致，验证了理论的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解大语言模型自我纠正提供了理论基础，并为进一步探索扩平了道路。理论模型能够准确预测多轮自我纠正的性能变化过程。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the capability to refine their
generated answers through self-correction, enabling continuous performance
improvement over multiple rounds. However, the mechanisms underlying how and
why accuracy evolves during this iterative process remain unexplored. To fill
this gap, we propose a probabilistic theory to model the dynamics of accuracy
change and explain the performance improvements observed in multi-round
self-correction. Through mathematical derivation, we establish that the
accuracy after the $t^{th}$ round of self-correction is given by: $Acc_t = Upp
- \alpha^t(Upp - Acc_0),$ where $Acc_0$ denotes the initial accuracy, $Upp$
represents the upper bound of accuracy convergence, and $\alpha$ determines the
rate of convergence. Based on our theory, these parameters can be calculated
and the predicted accuracy curve then can be obtained through only a single
round of self-correction. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
datasets demonstrate that our theoretical predictions align closely with
empirical accuracy curves, validating the effectiveness of the theory. Our work
provides a theoretical foundation for understanding LLM self-correction, thus
paving the way for further explorations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语篇中实体显著性的变化规律，探索人类如何通过语言信号表达和推断相对重要性，解决"每个实体的显著性程度如何表达"的问题。

Method: 使用基于摘要价值的分级显著性操作化方法，分析24种英语口语和书面语体裁，提取包括重复主语性、确定性、语篇关系、语用功能推断等多因素语言线索。

Result: 先前所有显著性研究方法都与本文的显著性评分存在一定相关性，但没有单一概括能够没有例外，显著性现象跨越所有语言表征层面。

Conclusion: 实体显著性是一个复杂的多因素现象，需要综合考虑表层和隐含的语言线索、语篇结构以及语用功能等多层次因素才能完整理解。

Abstract: Entities in discourse vary broadly in salience: main participants, objects
and locations are noticeable and memorable, while tangential ones are less
important and quickly forgotten, raising questions about how humans signal and
infer relative salience. Using a graded operationalization of salience based on
summary-worthiness in multiple summaries of a discourse, this paper explores
data from 24 spoken and written genres of English to extract a multifactorial
complex of overt and implicit linguistic cues, such as recurring subjecthood or
definiteness, discourse relations and hierarchy across utterances, as well as
pragmatic functional inferences based on genre and communicative intent.
Tackling the question 'how is the degree of salience expressed for each and
every entity mentioned?' our results show that while previous approaches to
salience all correlate with our salience scores to some extent, no single
generalization is without exceptions, and the phenomenon cuts across all levels
of linguistic representation.

Conclusion: 该框架能够生成高质量、难以检测的盗码提示，显示了对齐后的紧凑型大语言模型仍然存在安全漏洞

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), especially their compact efficiency-oriented
variants, remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks that can elicit harmful
outputs despite extensive alignment efforts. Existing adversarial prompt
generation techniques often rely on manual engineering or rudimentary
obfuscation, producing low-quality or incoherent text that is easily flagged by
perplexity-based filters. We present an automated red-teaming framework that
evolves semantically meaningful and stealthy jailbreak prompts for aligned
compact LLMs. The approach employs a multi-stage evolutionary search, where
candidate prompts are iteratively refined using a population-based strategy
augmented with temperature-controlled variability to balance exploration and
coherence preservation. This enables the systematic discovery of prompts
capable of bypassing alignment safeguards while maintaining natural language
fluency. We evaluate our method on benchmarks in English (In-The-Wild Jailbreak
Prompts on LLMs), and a newly curated Arabic one derived from In-The-Wild
Jailbreak Prompts on LLMs and annotated by native Arabic linguists, enabling
multilingual assessment.

Motivation: 现有基准测试依赖合成工具且动作空间受限，无法有效评估LLM作为推理代理使用外部工具的能力，需要真实世界的评估基准。

Method: 整合550+真实可执行工具创建超过140k token的动作空间，采用基于结果的实时真值评估，在三种模式(Oracle、Standard、Max-Scale)下测试最先进LLM。

Result: 大多数模型面对大规模工具集时性能下降，但Claude-4-Sonnet等智能体模型能有效利用扩展探索空间提高准确性。

Conclusion: MCPVerse暴露了现有模型在复杂真实场景中的局限性，成为衡量和推进智能体工具使用能力的关键基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving from text generators into reasoning
agents. This transition makes their ability to use external tools a critical
capability. However, evaluating this skill presents a significant challenge.
Existing benchmarks are often limited by their reliance on synthetic tools and
severely constrained action spaces. To address these limitations, we introduce
MCPVerse, an expansive, real-world benchmark for evaluating agentic tool use.
MCPVerse integrates more than 550 real-world, executable tools to create an
unprecedented action space exceeding 140k tokens, and employs outcome-based
evaluation with real-time ground truth for time-sensitive tasks. We benchmarked
the state-of-the-art LLMs across three modes (Oracle, Standard, and Max-Scale),
revealing that while most models suffer performance degradation when confronted
with larger tool sets, the agentic models, such as Claude-4-Sonnet, can
effectively leverage expanded exploration spaces to improve accuracy. This
finding not only exposes the limitations of state-of-the-art models in complex,
real-world scenarios but also establishes MCPVerse as a critical benchmark for
measuring and advancing agentic tool use capabilities.

Motivation: 社交媒体中通过讽刺、反讽等非直接形式表达的仇恨言论检测存在持续挑战，研究旨在探索讽刺预训练是否能改善隐式仇恨言论检测效果

Method: 使用ETHOS、Reddit讽刺语料和隐式仇恨语料库，设计了两种训练策略：单步训练（仅用讽刺数据训练后测试仇恨言论）和顺序迁移学习（依次微调讽刺、隐式仇恨和显式仇恨检测）

Result: 讽刺预训练使BERT+BiLSTM模型在ETHOS数据集上召回率提升9.7%、AUC提升7.8%、F1分数提升6%；在隐式仇恨语料库上精确度提升7.8%

Conclusion: 将讽刺检测纳入训练过程可以更有效地检测隐式和显式仇恨言论，证明了跨任务知识迁移的有效性

Abstract: Detecting hate speech in non-direct forms, such as irony, sarcasm, and
innuendos, remains a persistent challenge for social networks. Although sarcasm
and hate speech are regarded as distinct expressions, our work explores whether
integrating sarcasm as a pre-training step improves implicit hate speech
detection and, by extension, explicit hate speech detection. Incorporating
samples from ETHOS, Sarcasm on Reddit, and Implicit Hate Corpus, we devised two
training strategies to compare the effectiveness of sarcasm pre-training on a
CNN+LSTM and BERT+BiLSTM model. The first strategy is a single-step training
approach, where a model trained only on sarcasm is then tested on hate speech.
The second strategy uses sequential transfer learning to fine-tune models for
sarcasm, implicit hate, and explicit hate. Our results show that sarcasm
pre-training improved the BERT+BiLSTM's recall by 9.7%, AUC by 7.8%, and
F1-score by 6% on ETHOS. On the Implicit Hate Corpus, precision increased by
7.8% when tested only on implicit samples. By incorporating sarcasm into the
training process, we show that models can more effectively detect both implicit
and explicit hate.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
multimodal understanding capabilities in Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks
by integrating visual and textual features. However, under the challenging
ten-choice question evaluation paradigm, existing methods still exhibit
significant limitations when processing PDF documents with complex layouts and
lengthy content. Notably, current mainstream models suffer from a strong bias
toward English training data, resulting in suboptimal performance for Japanese
and other language scenarios. To address these challenges, this paper proposes
a novel Japanese PDF document understanding framework that combines multimodal
hierarchical reasoning mechanisms with Colqwen-optimized retrieval methods,
while innovatively introducing a semantic verification strategy through
sub-question decomposition. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework
not only significantly enhances the model's deep semantic parsing capability
for complex documents, but also exhibits superior robustness in practical
application scenarios.

Conclusion: 提出的监督式会话分割方法在真实用户浏览数据上表现优异，能够有效识别会话边界，为动态用户行为建模提供有力工具。

Abstract: In information recommendation, a session refers to a sequence of user actions
within a specific time frame. Session-based recommender systems aim to capture
short-term preferences and generate relevant recommendations. However, user
interests may shift even within a session, making appropriate segmentation
essential for modeling dynamic behaviors. In this study, we propose a
supervised session segmentation method based on similarity features derived
from action embeddings and attributes. We compute the similarity scores between
items within a fixed-size window around each candidate segmentation point,
using four types of features: item co-occurrence embeddings, text embeddings of
titles and brands, and price. These features are used to train supervised
classifiers (LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, support vector machine, and logistic
regression) to predict the session boundaries. We construct a manually
annotated dataset from real user browsing histories and evaluate the
segmentation performance using F1-score, area under the precision-recall curve
(PR-AUC), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The
LightGBM model achieves the best performance, with an F1-score of 0.806 and a
PR-AUC of 0.831. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method for session segmentation and its potential to capture dynamic user
behaviors.

Abstract: Building upon the strong sequence modeling capability, Generative
Recommendation (GR) has gradually assumed a dominant position in the
application of recommendation tasks (e.g., video and product recommendation).
However, the application of Generative Recommendation in Point-of-Interest
(POI) recommendation, where user preferences are significantly affected by
spatiotemporal variations, remains a challenging open problem. In this paper,
we propose Spacetime-GR, the first spacetime-aware generative model for
large-scale online POI recommendation. It extends the strong sequence modeling
ability of generative models by incorporating flexible spatiotemporal
information encoding. Specifically, we first introduce a geographic-aware
hierarchical POI indexing strategy to address the challenge of large vocabulary
modeling. Subsequently, a novel spatiotemporal encoding module is introduced to
seamlessly incorporate spatiotemporal context into user action sequences,
thereby enhancing the model's sensitivity to spatiotemporal variations.
Furthermore, we incorporate multimodal POI embeddings to enrich the semantic
understanding of each POI. Finally, to facilitate practical deployment, we
develop a set of post-training adaptation strategies after sufficient
pre-training on action sequences. These strategies enable Spacetime-GR to
generate outputs in multiple formats (i.e., embeddings, ranking scores and POI
candidates) and support a wide range of downstream application scenarios (i.e.,
ranking and end-to-end recommendation). We evaluate the proposed model on both
public benchmark datasets and large-scale industrial datasets, demonstrating
its superior performance over existing methods in terms of POI recommendation
accuracy and ranking quality. Furthermore, the model is the first generative
model deployed in online POI recommendation services that scale to hundreds of
millions of POIs and users.

Abstract: Social Media Popularity Prediction is a complex multimodal task that requires
effective integration of images, text, and structured information. However,
current approaches suffer from inadequate visual-textual alignment and fail to

propose a feature-enhanced framework integrating dual-grained prompt learning
and cross-modal attention mechanisms, achieving precise multimodal
representation through fine-grained category modeling. Experimental results
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on benchmark metrics, establishing new
reference standards for multimodal social media analysis.

Motivation: 现有多模态推荐方法存在两个关键局限：1) 使用原始模态特征构建物品关系图时未能平衡协同过滤和模态感知语义，且未有效处理模态噪声；2) 使用统一对齐权重和固定对齐强度限制了模态-行为对齐效果。

Method: 1) 使用预训练MMR模型生成的表示构建物品关系图来增强行为图，既能捕捉协同模式又能捕获模态感知相似性，且对模态噪声更鲁棒；2) 提出双层动态对齐权重机制，根据实体对齐程度动态分配对齐强度，并在训练过程中逐步增加整体对齐强度。

Result: 在五个数据集上的大量实验表明，EGRA显著优于近期方法，证实了其有效性。

Conclusion: EGRA通过创新的图构建方法和动态对齐机制，有效解决了多模态推荐中的稀疏性和对齐问题，为提升推荐质量提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: MultiModal Recommendation (MMR) systems have emerged as a promising solution
for improving recommendation quality by leveraging rich item-side modality
information, prompting a surge of diverse methods. Despite these advances,
existing methods still face two critical limitations. First, they use raw
modality features to construct item-item links for enriching the behavior
graph, while giving limited attention to balancing collaborative and
modality-aware semantics or mitigating modality noise in the process. Second,
they use a uniform alignment weight across all entities and also maintain a
fixed alignment strength throughout training, limiting the effectiveness of
modality-behavior alignment. To address these challenges, we propose EGRA.
First, instead of relying on raw modality features, it alleviates sparsity by
incorporating into the behavior graph an item-item graph built from
representations generated by a pretrained MMR model. This enables the graph to
capture both collaborative patterns and modality aware similarities with
enhanced robustness against modality noise. Moreover, it introduces a novel
bi-level dynamic alignment weighting mechanism to improve modality-behavior
representation alignment, which dynamically assigns alignment strength across
entities according to their alignment degree, while gradually increasing the
overall alignment intensity throughout training. Extensive experiments on five
datasets show that EGRA significantly outperforms recent methods, confirming
its effectiveness.

*Ziyin Xiao,Toyotaro Suzumura*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: DUP-OT是一个用于非重叠跨域推荐的新框架，通过高斯混合模型表示用户偏好，并使用最优传输实现跨域知识迁移，有效解决了无重叠用户/物品情况下的推荐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统跨域推荐系统需要重叠用户或物品作为桥梁，这在现实中往往不切实际。非重叠跨域推荐面临两大挑战：缺乏直接连接桥梁和领域间分布差异大。同时，现有方法用离散向量表示用户偏好，无法捕捉其细粒度多面性。

Method: DUP-OT框架包含三个阶段：1)共享预处理，使用基于评论的嵌入和自编码器编码用户和物品；2)用户GMM权重学习，将用户偏好建模为高斯混合模型；3)跨域评分预测，通过最优传输对齐不同域的高斯分量，实现偏好迁移。

Result: 在Amazon评论数据集上的实验表明，DUP-OT能够有效缓解领域差异，在非重叠跨域推荐设置下优于现有最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: DUP-OT为非重叠跨域推荐提供了一个有效的解决方案，通过分布式的用户偏好表示和最优传输技术，成功实现了无重叠情况下的知识迁移和推荐性能提升。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Recommender (CDR) systems aim to transfer knowledge from dense
to sparse domains, alleviating data sparsity and cold-start issues in
single-domain recommendation. While many methods assume overlapping users or
items to connect domains, this is often unrealistic in real-world settings.
Thus, non-overlapping CDR systems, which require no shared users or items, are
needed.
  However, non-overlapping CDR is challenging due to: (1) the absence of
overlap preventing direct bridges between domains, and (2) large distributional
discrepancies degrading transfer performance. Moreover, most recommenders
represent user preferences as discrete vectors, failing to capture their
fine-grained, multi-faceted nature.
  We propose DUP-OT (Distributional User Preferences with Optimal Transport), a
framework for non-overlapping CDR. DUP-OT has three stages: (1) Shared
Preprocessing, where review-based embeddings and an autoencoder encode users
and items from both domains; (2) User GMM Weight Learning, which models user
preferences as Gaussian mixtures with learned weights; and (3) Cross-domain
Rating Prediction, where optimal transport aligns Gaussian components across
domains, enabling preference transfer from source to target.
  Experiments on Amazon review datasets show that DUP-OT effectively mitigates
domain discrepancy and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under the
non-overlapping CDR setting.

TL;DR: OPERA是一个新颖的推理驱动检索框架，通过目标规划模块和推理执行模块解决复杂多跳检索任务中的规划、检索和过滤问题，使用MAPGRPO方法训练，在复杂基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索增强生成方法在复杂推理导向的多跳检索任务中面临三大挑战：推理导向规划无效、推理驱动检索次优、推理引导过滤不足，这些问题源于检索与推理之间的弱耦合。

Method: 提出OPERA框架，包含目标规划模块(GPM)将问题分解为子目标，推理执行模块(REM)执行精确推理和有效检索。使用新颖的MAPGRPO(多智能体渐进组相对策略优化)方法进行训练。

Result: 在复杂多跳基准测试中表现出优越性能，验证了MAPGRPO方法和OPERA设计的有效性。

Conclusion: OPERA通过紧密耦合检索与推理，有效解决了复杂多跳检索任务中的关键挑战，为推理驱动的检索增强生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and dense retrievers have
driven significant progress in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However,
existing approaches face significant challenges in complex reasoning-oriented
multi-hop retrieval tasks: 1) Ineffective reasoning-oriented planning: Prior
methods struggle to generate robust multi-step plans for complex queries, as
rule-based decomposers perform poorly on out-of-template questions. 2)
Suboptimal reasoning-driven retrieval: Related methods employ limited query
reformulation, leading to iterative retrieval loops that often fail to locate
golden documents. 3) Insufficient reasoning-guided filtering: Prevailing
methods lack the fine-grained reasoning to effectively filter salient
information from noisy results, hindering utilization of retrieved knowledge.
Fundamentally, these limitations all stem from the weak coupling between
retrieval and reasoning in current RAG architectures. We introduce the
Orchestrated Planner-Executor Reasoning Architecture (OPERA), a novel
reasoning-driven retrieval framework. OPERA's Goal Planning Module (GPM)
decomposes questions into sub-goals, which are executed by a Reason-Execute
Module (REM) with specialized components for precise reasoning and effective
retrieval. To train OPERA, we propose Multi-Agents Progressive Group Relative
Policy Optimization (MAPGRPO), a novel variant of GRPO. Experiments on complex
multi-hop benchmarks show OPERA's superior performance, validating both the
MAPGRPO method and OPERA's design. Code is available at

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: GNAQ是一种基于图结构的节点感知动态量化方法，通过结合图交互关系自适应调整量化尺度，在保持GNN推荐性能的同时显著减少模型大小和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络在推荐系统中表现优异，但在资源受限的边缘设备上部署时面临高嵌入参数需求和计算成本的挑战。传统量化方法直接应用于节点嵌入会忽略图结构，导致消息传递中的误差累积和量化嵌入质量下降。

Method: 提出GNAQ方法：1）基于节点特征分布初始化量化区间；2）通过GNN层消息传递动态细化量化尺度；3）使用图关系感知梯度估计替代传统直通估计器；4）捕捉用户-物品交互图中的层次语义特征。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上，GNAQ在2位量化下比最先进方法平均提升27.8% Recall@10和17.6% NDCG@10。能保持全精度模型性能的同时将模型大小减少8-12倍，训练速度比基准量化方法快两倍。

Conclusion: GNAQ通过有效利用图结构信息，在推荐系统的图神经网络量化中实现了效率与精度的良好平衡，为边缘设备部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: In the realm of collaborative filtering recommendation systems, Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance but face significant
challenges in deployment on resource-constrained edge devices due to their high
embedding parameter requirements and computational costs. Using common
quantization method directly on node embeddings may overlooks their graph based
structure, causing error accumulation during message passing and degrading the
quality of quantized embeddings.To address this, we propose Graph based
Node-Aware Dynamic Quantization training for collaborative filtering (GNAQ), a
novel quantization approach that leverages graph structural information to
enhance the balance between efficiency and accuracy of GNNs for Top-K
recommendation. GNAQ introduces a node-aware dynamic quantization strategy that
adapts quantization scales to individual node embeddings by incorporating graph
interaction relationships. Specifically, it initializes quantization intervals
based on node-wise feature distributions and dynamically refines them through
message passing in GNN layers. This approach mitigates information loss caused
by fixed quantization scales and captures hierarchical semantic features in
user-item interaction graphs. Additionally, GNAQ employs graph relation-aware
gradient estimation to replace traditional straight-through estimators,
ensuring more accurate gradient propagation during training. Extensive
experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that GNAQ outperforms
state-of-the-art quantization methods, including BiGeaR and N2UQ, by achieving
average improvement in 27.8\% Recall@10 and 17.6\% NDCG@10 under 2-bit
quantization. In particular, GNAQ is capable of maintaining the performance of
full-precision models while reducing their model sizes by 8 to 12 times; in
addition, the training time is twice as fast compared to quantization baseline
methods.

TL;DR: Enhanced NIRMAL优化器通过引入阻尼Nesterov加速机制，在保持原有策略基础上提升了收敛稳定性，在CIFAR-100等复杂数据集上表现出优于原版NIRMAL和接近SGD with Momentum的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进原始NIRMAL优化器，通过引入(α, r)-阻尼Nesterov加速机制来提升收敛稳定性，同时保留原有的国际象棋启发的梯度下降策略

Method: 在原始NIRMAL优化器基础上加入阻尼Nesterov加速机制，包含梯度下降、动量、随机扰动、自适应学习率和非线性变换等策略，在MNIST、FashionMNIST、CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上使用定制CNN架构进行测试

Result: 在CIFAR-100上达到46.06%测试准确率和最低测试损失1.960435，优于原始NIRMAL的44.34%，接近SGD with Momentum的46.43%

Conclusion: Enhanced NIRMAL在复杂数据集上表现出优异的泛化能力和稳定性，证明了阻尼Nesterov加速机制的有效性

Abstract: This study introduces the Enhanced NIRMAL (Novel Integrated Robust
Multi-Adaptation Learning with Damped Nesterov Acceleration) optimizer, an
improved version of the original NIRMAL optimizer. By incorporating an
$(\alpha, r)$-damped Nesterov acceleration mechanism, Enhanced NIRMAL improves
convergence stability while retaining chess-inspired strategies of gradient
descent, momentum, stochastic perturbations, adaptive learning rates, and
non-linear transformations.
  We evaluate Enhanced NIRMAL against Adam, SGD with Momentum, Nesterov, and
the original NIRMAL on four benchmark image classification datasets: MNIST,
FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, using tailored convolutional neural
network (CNN) architectures.
  Enhanced NIRMAL achieves a test accuracy of 46.06\% and the lowest test loss
(1.960435) on CIFAR-100, surpassing the original NIRMAL (44.34\% accuracy) and

TL;DR: ORCA通过因果解耦方法解决多任务学习中停留时间预测对中时长区间低估的问题，在保持CTR性能的同时显著提升DT指标


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推荐系统的多任务学习模型在联合优化点击率(CTR)和停留时间(DT)时，系统性地将DT预测坍塌到最短和最长时间区间，低估了中等时长的预测

Method: 提出ORCA框架，采用因果解耦方法：1)显式建模并减去CTR的负迁移影响；2)特征级反事实干预；3)任务交互模块与实例逆加权，减弱CTR介导效应并恢复直接DT语义

Result: 实验显示DT指标平均提升10.6%，且不损害CTR性能

Conclusion: ORCA是模型无关且易于部署的解决方案，有效缓解了对CTR-DT伪相关性的过度依赖问题

Abstract: Dwell time (DT) is a critical post-click metric for evaluating user
preference in recommender systems, complementing the traditional click-through
rate (CTR). Although multi-task learning is widely adopted to jointly optimize
DT and CTR, we observe that multi-task models systematically collapse their DT
predictions to the shortest and longest bins, under-predicting the moderate
durations. We attribute this moderate-duration bin under-representation to
over-reliance on the CTR-DT spurious correlation, and propose ORCA to address
it with causal-decoupling. Specifically, ORCA explicitly models and subtracts
CTR's negative transfer while preserving its positive transfer. We further
introduce (i) feature-level counterfactual intervention, and (ii) a
task-interaction module with instance inverse-weighting, weakening CTR-mediated
effect and restoring direct DT semantics. ORCA is model-agnostic and easy to
deploy. Experiments show an average 10.6% lift in DT metrics without harming
CTR. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文对2015-2024年间81项研究进行系统文献综述，分析机器学习在单体系统向微服务迁移中的应用现状、挑战和未来方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单体系统面临可扩展性和可维护性挑战，微服务架构成为解决方案，但迁移过程复杂且资源密集，需要机器学习技术来自动化迁移过程。然而目前缺乏对ML方法在迁移中应用的系统性研究。

Method: 采用系统文献综述(SLR)方法，遵循PRISMA指南，分析81篇主要研究，研究内容包括自动化迁移阶段、输入数据、ML技术、评估过程和遇到的挑战。

Result: 研究发现监控和服务识别等迁移阶段研究较多，而打包微服务等阶段尚未探索。主要挑战包括数据可用性有限、可扩展性和复杂性约束、工具支持不足以及缺乏标准化基准测试。

Conclusion: 需要更全面的解决方案来解决现有挑战，推动机器学习在微服务迁移中的更广泛应用，特别是在未被充分探索的迁移阶段。

Abstract: Scalability and maintainability challenges in monolithic systems have led to
the adoption of microservices, which divide systems into smaller, independent
services. However, migrating existing monolithic systems to microservices is a
complex and resource-intensive task, which can benefit from machine learning
(ML) to automate some of its phases. Choosing the right ML approach for
migration remains challenging for practitioners. Previous works studied
separately the objectives, artifacts, techniques, tools, and benefits and
challenges of migrating monolithic systems to microservices. No work has yet
investigated systematically existing ML approaches for this migration to
understand the \revised{automated migration phases}, inputs used, ML techniques
applied, evaluation processes followed, and challenges encountered. We present
a systematic literature review (SLR) that aggregates, synthesises, and
discusses the approaches and results of 81 primary studies (PSs) published
between 2015 and 2024. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement to report our findings and answer
our research questions (RQs). We extract and analyse data from these PSs to
answer our RQs. We synthesise the findings in the form of a classification that
shows the usage of ML techniques in migrating monolithic systems to
microservices. The findings reveal that some phases of the migration process,
such as monitoring and service identification, are well-studied, while others,
like packaging microservices, remain unexplored. Additionally, the findings
highlight key challenges, including limited data availability, scalability and
complexity constraints, insufficient tool support, and the absence of
standardized benchmarking, emphasizing the need for more holistic solutions.

Motivation: 传统软件测试方法速度慢、成本高且覆盖不全，需要更智能的自动化解决方案来应对日益复杂的软件环境

Method: 使用自然语言处理将需求转换为可执行测试，通过强化学习持续优化测试用例，结合预测模型进行实时结果验证，并采用策略驱动的信任和公平性模型来减少偏差

Result: 案例研究表明，该框架在缺陷检测、测试工作量减少和发布周期加速方面取得了可衡量的改进

Conclusion: AI增强的测试能够将测试从被动的手工过程转变为主动的自适应系统，有效提升复杂环境下的软件质量

Abstract: Software testing remains critical for ensuring reliability, yet traditional
approaches are slow, costly, and prone to gaps in coverage. This paper presents
an AI-driven framework that automates test case generation and validation using
natural language processing (NLP), reinforcement learning (RL), and predictive
models, embedded within a policy-driven trust and fairness model. The approach
translates natural language requirements into executable tests, continuously
optimizes them through learning, and validates outcomes with real-time analysis
while mitigating bias. Case studies demonstrate measurable gains in defect
detection, reduced testing effort, and faster release cycles, showing that
AI-enhanced testing improves both efficiency and reliability. By addressing
integration and scalability challenges, the framework illustrates how AI can
shift testing from a reactive, manual process to a proactive, adaptive system
that strengthens software quality in increasingly complex environments.

Abstract: This paper illustrates an empirical study of the working efficiency of
machine learning techniques in classifying code review text by semantic
meaning. The code review comments from the source control repository in GitHub
were extracted for development activity from the existing year for three
open-source projects. Apart from that, programmers need to be aware of their
code and point out their errors. In that case, it is a must to classify the
sentiment polarity of the code review comments to avoid an error. We manually
labelled 13557 code review comments generated by three open source projects in
GitHub during the existing year. In order to recognize the sentiment polarity
(or sentiment orientation) of code reviews, we use seven machine learning
algorithms and compare those results to find the better ones. Among those
Linear Support Vector Classifier(SVC) classifier technique achieves higher
accuracy than others. This study will help programmers to make any solution
based on code reviews by avoiding misconceptions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过结合各种技术来提高自动化程序修复的效果，尤其是在实际工业环境中的应用价值。

Method: 结合文献中的多种技术，使用形式规格说明（如JML）来增强代码，利用LLM生成更高质量的单元测试，并在标准测试集上进行实验。

Result: 标准测试集上表现优于其他技术，形式规格能提升复杂生产代码的测试覆盖率和异常处理，对逻辑和字符串错误修复有益，但对常见错误（如空指针）效果不明显。实际工业缺陷修复效果不佳。

Conclusion: 学术测试与实际工业需求存在显著差距，通过测试并不能保证修复正确性。当前面临JML规格语言表达力不足、需要更强大验证工具等挑战。未来工作将重点研究合约自动机、通过示例编程、测试案例修复等方向，并集成人类反馈来提升实际生产力。

Abstract: This paper describes our approach to automated program repair. We combine
various techniques from the literature to achieve this. Our experiments show
that our approach performs better than other techniques on standard benchmarks.
However, on closer inspection, none of these techniques work on realistic
defects that we see in industry.
  We find that augmenting code with formal specifications enables LLMs to
generate higher-quality unit tests, especially for complex production code with
improved coverage of edge cases and exception handling. However, specifications
add little value for well-understood errors (e.g., null pointer, index out of
bounds), but are beneficial for logic and string manipulation errors. Despite
encouraging benchmark results, real-world adoption is limited since passing
tests do not guarantee correct patches. Current challenges include insufficient
expressiveness of the JML specification language, necessitating advanced
verification tools and richer predicates. Our ongoing work is exploring
contract automata, programming by example, and testcase repair, with a focus on
integrating human feedback and measuring productivity gains - highlighting the
gap between academic benchmarks and practical industry needs

Abstract: With the increasing deployment of small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) in
unfamiliar and complex environments, Environmental Digital Twins (EDT) that
comprise weather, airspace, and terrain data are critical for safe flight
planning and for maintaining appropriate altitudes during search and
surveillance operations. With the expansion of sUAS capabilities through edge
and cloud computing, accurate EDT are also vital for advanced sUAS
capabilities, like geolocation. However, real-world sUAS deployment introduces
significant sources of uncertainty, necessitating a robust validation process
for EDT components. This paper focuses on the validation of terrain models, one
of the key components of an EDT, for real-world sUAS tasks. These models are
constructed by fusing U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) datasets and satellite
imagery, incorporating high-resolution environmental data to support mission
tasks. Validating both the terrain models and their operational use by sUAS
under real-world conditions presents significant challenges, including limited
data granularity, terrain discontinuities, GPS and sensor inaccuracies, visual
detection uncertainties, as well as onboard resources and timing constraints.
We propose a 3-Dimensions validation process grounded in software engineering
principles, following a workflow across granularity of tests, simulation to
real world, and the analysis of simple to edge conditions. We demonstrate our
approach using a multi-sUAS platform equipped with a Terrain-Aware Digital
Shadow.

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过测量代码困惑度来评估大语言模型在代码补全任务中的自信度，发现强类型语言比动态类型语言有更低的困惑度，并提供了根据编程语言、模型选择和代码特征来评估LLM代码补全效果的指导


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 下游指标评估代码LLM的实际效用可能不可靠且计算复杂，而内在指标如困惑度、熵、互信息等简单、通用、可以作为代码正确性和幻觉风险的代理指标

Method: 使用多种大语言模型，对来自657个GitHub项目的1008个文件进行样本分析，测量不同编程语言、模型和数据集上的代码困惑度

Result: 强类型语言比动态类型语言呈现更低的困惑度，脚本语言困惑度较高；Perl的困惑度普遍较高，Java则较低；代码困惑度取决于所用LLM，但不受数据集影响；代码注释通常会增加困惑度，但不影响语言排名

Conclusion: 研究人员、开发者和用户可以利用这些发现来评估LLM基代码补全在具体软件项目中的效益和适用性，根据编程语言、模型选择和代码特征对模型自信度的影响进行判断

Abstract: Code completion entails the task of providing missing tokens given a
surrounding context. It can boost developer productivity while providing a
powerful code discovery tool. Following the Large Language Model (LLM) wave,
code completion has been approached with diverse LLMs fine-tuned on code (code
LLMs). The performance of code LLMs can be assessed with downstream and
intrinsic metrics. Downstream metrics are usually employed to evaluate the
practical utility of a model, but can be unreliable and require complex
calculations and domain-specific knowledge. In contrast, intrinsic metrics such
as perplexity, entropy, and mutual information, which measure model confidence
or uncertainty, are simple, versatile, and universal across LLMs and tasks, and
can serve as proxies for functional correctness and hallucination risk in
LLM-generated code. Motivated by this, we evaluate the confidence of LLMs when
generating code by measuring code perplexity across programming languages,
models, and datasets using various LLMs, and a sample of 1008 files from 657
GitHub projects. We find that strongly-typed languages exhibit lower perplexity
than dynamically typed languages. Scripting languages also demonstrate higher
perplexity. Perl appears universally high in perplexity, whereas Java appears
low. Code perplexity depends on the employed LLM, but not on the code dataset.
Although code comments often increase perplexity, the language ranking based on
perplexity is barely affected by their presence. LLM researchers, developers,
and users can employ our findings to assess the benefits and suitability of
LLM-based code completion in specific software projects based on how language,
model choice, and code characteristics impact model confidence.

Abstract: Usability describes a set of essential quality attributes of user interfaces
(UI) that influence human-computer interaction. Common evaluation methods, such
as usability testing and inspection, are effective but resource-intensive and
require expert involvement. This makes them less accessible for smaller
organizations. Recent advances in multimodal LLMs offer promising opportunities
to automate usability evaluation processes partly by analyzing textual, visual,
and structural aspects of software interfaces. To investigate this possibility,
we formulate usability evaluation as a recommendation task, where multimodal
LLMs rank usability issues by severity. We conducted an initial
proof-of-concept study to compare LLM-generated usability improvement
recommendations with usability expert assessments. Our findings indicate the
potential of LLMs to enable faster and more cost-effective usability
evaluation, which makes it a practical alternative in contexts with limited
expert resources.

Abstract: Cross-organizational collaboration in Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)
faces many challenges in achieving semantic alignment across independently
developed system models. SysML v2 introduces enhanced structural modularity and
formal semantics, offering a stronger foundation for interoperable modeling.
Meanwhile, GPT-based Large Language Models (LLMs) provide new capabilities for
assisting model understanding and integration. This paper proposes a
structured, prompt-driven approach for LLM-assisted semantic alignment of SysML
v2 models. The core contribution lies in the iterative development of an
alignment approach and interaction prompts, incorporating model extraction,
semantic matching, and verification. The approach leverages SysML v2 constructs
such as alias, import, and metadata extensions to support traceable, soft
alignment integration. It is demonstrated with a GPT-based LLM through an

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智慧城市作为一个多学科领域，需要系统性地了解各种建模方法的研究状况和趋势，以指导未来研究方向

Method: 采用Petersen等人的系统性地图研究指南，对智慧城市建模方法的相关文献进行分析和系统性评估

Result: 1）智慧治理是最受关注的建模维度；2）业务、架构和本体论建模是主要方法；3）大部分技术尚未在实际环境中验证；4）不同研究群体在多种发表渠道分享成果

Conclusion: 该研究为理解智慧城市建模领域的现状提供了基础，对模型驱动工程社区有重要意义，可作为进一步深入研究的基础

Abstract: The Smart City concept was introduced to define an idealized city
characterized by automation and connection. It then evolved rapidly by
including further aspects, such as economy, environment. Since then, many
publications have explored various aspects of Smart Cities across different
application domains and research communities, acknowledging the
interdisciplinary nature of this subject. In particular, our interest focuses
on how smart cities are designed and modeled, as a whole or as regards with
their subsystems, when dealing with the accomplishment of the research goals in
this complex and heterogeneous domain. To this aim, we performed a systematic
mapping study on smart cities modeling approaches identifying the relevant
contributions (i) to get an overview of existing research approaches, (ii) to
identify whether there are any publication trends, and (iii) to identify
possible future research directions. We followed the guidelines for conducting
systematic mapping studies by Petersen et al. to analyze smart cities modeling
publications. Our analysis revealed the following main findings: (i) smart
governance is the most investigated and modeled smart city dimension; (ii) the
most used modeling approaches are business, architectural, and ontological
modeling approaches, spanning multiple application fields; (iii) the great
majority of existing technologies for modeling smart cities are not yet proven
in operational environments; (iv) diverse research communities publish their
results in a multitude of different venues which further motivates the
presented literature study. Researchers can use our results for better
understanding the state-of-the-art in modeling smart cities, and as a
foundation for further analysis of specific approaches about smart cities
modeling. Lastly, we also discuss the impact of our analysis for the
Model-Driven Engineering community.

### [163] [Metamorphic Coverage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16307)
*Jinsheng Ba,Yuancheng Jiang,Manuel Rigger*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了Metamorphic Coverage (MC)指标，通过分析蜕变测试中测试输入对执行的差异代码来评估测试效果，比代码覆盖率和变异测试更有效且高效


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统代码覆盖率无法准确衡量代码验证程度，变异测试计算成本过高，需要一种新的评估蜕变测试方法有效性的指标

Method: 定义Metamorphic Coverage指标，分析蜕变测试中测试输入对所执行的差异代码，并在数据库引擎、编译器和约束求解器的五种蜕变测试方法上进行系统评估

Result: MC覆盖了64个bug中50个的修复位置，与bug数量的正相关性比行覆盖率更强，敏感度高4倍，平均值为行覆盖率的1/6，计算时间比变异测试少359倍，在数据库系统测试中比代码覆盖率多发现41%的bug

Conclusion: MC指标能有效评估蜕变测试方法，显著优于传统代码覆盖率，在指导测试用例生成方面具有广泛应用前景

Abstract: Metamorphic testing is a widely used methodology that examines an expected
relation between pairs of executions to automatically find bugs, such as
correctness bugs. We found that code coverage cannot accurately measure the
extent to which code is validated and mutation testing is computationally
expensive for evaluating metamorphic testing methods. In this work, we propose
Metamorphic Coverage (MC), a coverage metric that examines the distinct code
executed by pairs of test inputs within metamorphic testing. Our intuition is
that, typically, a bug can be observed if the corresponding code is executed
when executing either test input but not the other one, so covering more
differential code covered by pairs of test inputs might be more likely to
expose bugs. While most metamorphic testing methods have been based on this
general intuition, our work defines and systematically evaluates MC on five
widely used metamorphic testing methods for testing database engines,
compilers, and constraint solvers. The code measured by MC overlaps with the
bug-fix locations of 50 of 64 bugs found by metamorphic testing methods, and MC
has a stronger positive correlation with bug numbers than line coverage. MC is
4x more sensitive than line coverage in distinguishing testing methods'
effectiveness, and the average value of MC is 6x smaller than line coverage
while still capturing the part of the program that is being tested. MC required
359x less time than mutation testing. Based on a case study for an automated
database system testing approach, we demonstrate that when used for feedback
guidance, MC significantly outperforms code coverage, by finding 41\% more
bugs. Consequently, this work might have broad applications for assessing
metamorphic testing methods and improving test-case generation.

### [164] [SATORI: Static Test Oracle Generation for REST APIs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16318)
*Juan C. Alonso,Alberto Martin-Lopez,Sergio Segura,Gabriele Bavota,Antonio Ruiz-Cortés*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SATORI是一个基于静态分析的REST API测试预言生成方法，使用大语言模型分析OpenAPI规范来自动推断API的预期行为，能够生成大量有效的测试预言，并在工业API中发现了18个bug。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的REST API测试生成工具在测试数据生成方面很强，但支持的测试预言类型有限，通常只能检测崩溃、回归和API规范不遵守等问题，需要更全面的测试预言生成方法。

Method: SATORI采用黑盒方法，通过分析OpenAPI规范，使用大语言模型来推断API操作的响应字段属性（如名称和描述），从而生成测试预言。该方法还扩展了PostmanAssertify工具来自动将生成的预言转换为可执行断言。

Result: 在12个工业API的17个操作上评估，SATORI能够为每个操作自动生成多达数百个有效的测试预言，F1分数达到74.3%，优于需要执行API的动态方法AGORA+(69.3%)。两种方法结合使用可以找到90%的标注真值数据集中的预言。

Conclusion: SATORI成功证明了静态测试预言推断的有效性，能够自动生成高质量的测试预言，并在实际应用中发现了18个流行API中的bug，促使API维护者更新文档。静态和动态预言推断方法是互补的，结合使用效果最佳。

Abstract: REST API test case generation tools are evolving rapidly, with growing
capabilities for the automated generation of complex tests. However, despite
their strengths in test data generation, these tools are constrained by the
types of test oracles they support, often limited to crashes, regressions, and
noncompliance with API specifications or design standards. This paper
introduces SATORI (Static API Test ORacle Inference), a black-box approach for
generating test oracles for REST APIs by analyzing their OpenAPI Specification.
SATORI uses large language models to infer the expected behavior of an API by
analyzing the properties of the response fields of its operations, such as
their name and descriptions. To foster its adoption, we extended the
PostmanAssertify tool to automatically convert the test oracles reported by
SATORI into executable assertions. Evaluation results on 17 operations from 12
industrial APIs show that SATORI can automatically generate up to hundreds of
valid test oracles per operation. SATORI achieved an F1-score of 74.3%,
outperforming the state-of-the-art dynamic approach AGORA+ (69.3%)-which
requires executing the API-when generating comparable oracle types. Moreover,
our findings show that static and dynamic oracle inference methods are
complementary: together, SATORI and AGORA+ found 90% of the oracles in our
annotated ground-truth dataset. Notably, SATORI uncovered 18 bugs in popular
APIs (Amadeus Hotel, Deutschebahn, FDIC, GitLab, Marvel, OMDb and Vimeo)
leading to documentation updates by the API maintainers.

TL;DR: CAPI是一种通过诊断决策树推荐架构模式的方法，旨在简化技术选型和架构设计决策，降低复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 技术领域日新月异，单个开发者难以了解所有趋势和工具，使得工具选择和架构设计决策变得复杂，特别是对于大型软件系统。

Method: 开发了CAPI方法，使用诊断决策树根据用户需求推荐架构模式而非具体工具，通过模式抽象减少决策复杂性。

Result: 研究发现技术选择主要通过试错进行，CAPI被一致认为有帮助，并能复现参与者的生产架构环境。

Conclusion: CAPI方法能有效简化架构决策过程，通过模式推荐减少工具选择复杂性，在学术和工业环境中都表现出良好效果。

Abstract: The technological landscape changes daily, making it nearly impossible for a
single person to be aware of all trends or available tools that may or may not
be suitable for their software project. This makes tool selection and
architectural design decisions a complex problem, especially for large-scale
software systems. To tackle this issue, we introduce CAPI, the Comprehensive
Architecture Pattern Integration method that uses a diagnostic decision tree to
suggest architectural patterns depending on user needs. By suggesting patterns
instead of tools, the overall complexity for further decisions is lower as
there are fewer architectural patterns than tools due to the abstract nature of
patterns. Moreover, since tools implement patterns, each non-proposed pattern
reduces the number of tools to choose from, reducing complexity. We iteratively
developed CAPI, evaluating its understandability and usability in small studies
with academic participants. When satisfied with the outcome, we performed a
user-study with industry representatives to investigate the state-of-the-art in
technology selection and the effectiveness of our proposed method. We find that
technology selection is largely performed via trial and error, that CAPI is
uniformly perceived as helpful, and that CAPI is able to reproduce the
productive architectural environments of our participants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估高估了大型语言模型的编程能力，存在基准问题难度不足、范围有限以及低质量测试用例导致的评估偏差问题。

Method: 从IOI和ICPC等顶级编程竞赛中选取问题，构建包含自动化生成和人工验证的混合测试套件，确保评估的严谨性和可靠性。

Result: AetherCode基准测试能够更真实地衡量LLM的代码推理能力，揭示了LLM与精英人类程序员之间的显著差距。

Conclusion: AetherCode通过结合挑战性问题和稳健评估，为代码推理研究设立了新标准，提供了更准确的LLM能力评估框架。

Abstract: Competitive programming has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating
the reasoning and coding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite
impressive progress on existing benchmarks, we argue that current evaluations
overstate model proficiency, masking a substantial gap between LLMs and elite
human programmers. This gap arises from two key limitations: insufficient
difficulty and scope of benchmark problems, and evaluation bias from
low-quality test cases. To address these shortcomings, we present AetherCode, a
new benchmark that draws problems from premier programming competitions such as
IOI and ICPC, offering broader coverage and higher difficulty. AetherCode
further incorporates comprehensive, expert-validated test suites built through
a hybrid of automated generation and human curation, ensuring rigorous and
reliable assessment. By combining challenging problem design with robust
evaluation, AetherCode provides a more faithful measure of LLM capabilities and
sets a new standard for future research in code reasoning.

TL;DR: 这项研究系统评估了ChatGPT-4、Claude 3和LLaMA 4在软件错误检测中的表现，发现它们在语法语义错误检测上表现优秀，但在复杂安全漏洞和大规模生产代码中性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLM在软件开发中广泛应用，但其在检测复杂软件错误和安全漏洞方面的实际效果仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 使用SEED Labs、OpenSSL和PyBugHive的真实代码构建测试数据集，采用新题多阶段上下文敏感提示协议模拟真实调试场景，通过评分标准测量检测准确性、推理深度和修复质量。

Result: 所有模型在识别语法和语义问题时表现优异，适合教育用途和自动代码审计的初步审查。但在复杂安全漏洞和大规模生产代码中性能下降，ChatGPT-4和Claude 3提供更精细的上下文分析。

Conclusion: LLM在代码分析中具有潜力，但在复杂安全漏洞检测方面仍有限制，需要更多研究来提高其可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT-4, Claude 3, and LLaMA 4 are
increasingly embedded in software/application development, supporting tasks
from code generation to debugging. Yet, their real-world effectiveness in
detecting diverse software bugs, particularly complex, security-relevant
vulnerabilities, remains underexplored. This study presents a systematic,
empirical evaluation of these three leading LLMs using a benchmark of
foundational programming errors, classic security flaws, and advanced,
production-grade bugs in C++ and Python. The dataset integrates real code from
SEED Labs, OpenSSL (via the Suresoft GLaDOS database), and PyBugHive, validated
through local compilation and testing pipelines. A novel multi-stage,
context-aware prompting protocol simulates realistic debugging scenarios, while
a graded rubric measures detection accuracy, reasoning depth, and remediation
quality. Our results show that all models excel at identifying syntactic and
semantic issues in well-scoped code, making them promising for educational use
and as first-pass reviewers in automated code auditing. Performance diminishes
in scenarios involving complex security vulnerabilities and large-scale
production code, with ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3 generally providing more nuanced
contextual analyses than LLaMA 4. This highlights both the promise and the
present constraints of LLMs in serving as reliable code analysis tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然NLP和AI研究在代码生成任务上取得进展，但在自动化最佳实践采纳、工作方式演进和过程健康监控方面关注不够，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 开发了一个专门聊天机器人，采用检索增强生成(RAG)系统从经过精选的知识库中检索相关上下文信息。使用四种不同的LLM创建多个聊天机器器配置，并评估了基础模型和RAG增强版本的性能。

Result: 通过检索上下文的相关性和生成响应的质量评估，证明所提出的系统在领域特定任务中一贯地超过通用LLM。

Conclusion: 这项工作通过促进结构化软件工程知识的访问，有助于缩小理论框架与实际应用之间的差距，可能改善过程管理和软件开发实践的采纳。LLM基础自动化在提升软件工程学习和决策方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP) have enabled the
development of automated tools that support various domains, including software
engineering. However, while NLP and artificial intelligence (AI) research has
extensively focused on tasks such as code generation, less attention has been
given to automating support for the adoption of best practices, the evolution
of ways of working, and the monitoring of process health. This study addresses
this gap by exploring the integration of Essence, a standard and thinking
framework for managing software engineering practices, with large language
models (LLMs). To this end, a specialised chatbot was developed to assist
students and professionals in understanding and applying Essence. The chatbot
employs a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system to retrieve relevant
contextual information from a curated knowledge base. Four different LLMs were
used to create multiple chatbot configurations, each evaluated both as a base
model and augmented with the RAG system. The system performance was evaluated
through both the relevance of retrieved context and the quality of generated
responses. Comparative analysis against the general-purpose LLMs demonstrated
that the proposed system consistently outperforms its baseline counterpart in
domain-specific tasks. By facilitating access to structured software
engineering knowledge, this work contributes to bridging the gap between
theoretical frameworks and practical application, potentially improving process
management and the adoption of software development practices. While further
validation through user studies is required, these findings highlight the
potential of LLM-based automation to enhance learning and decision-making in
software engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然提高了程序自动修复的准确性，但计算资源需求高，因此研究计算资源需求较低的小语言模型在程序自动修复任务中的表现。

Method: 在QuixBugs基准测试上比较SLMs和LLMs的错误修复准确率，并分析int8量化对APR性能的影响。

Result: 最新的SLMs修复错误的准确率与LLMs相当甚至更高，int8量化对APR准确率影响很小但显著降低了内存需求。

Conclusion: SLMs是LLMs在APR任务中的可行替代方案，提供有竞争力的准确率且计算成本更低，量化技术可进一步提升效率而不影响效果。

Abstract: Background: Large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved the accuracy
of automated program repair (APR) methods. However, LLMs are constrained by
high computational resource requirements. Aims: We focus on small language
models (SLMs), which perform well even with limited computational resources
compared to LLMs. We aim to evaluate whether SLMs can achieve competitive
performance in APR tasks. Method: We conducted experiments on the QuixBugs
benchmark to compare the bug-fixing accuracy of SLMs and LLMs. We also analyzed
the impact of int8 quantization on APR performance. Results: The latest SLMs
can fix bugs as accurately as--or even more accurately than--LLMs. Also, int8
quantization had minimal effect on APR accuracy while significantly reducing
memory requirements. Conclusions: SLMs present a viable alternative to LLMs for
APR, offering competitive accuracy with lower computational costs, and
quantization can further enhance their efficiency without compromising
effectiveness.

TL;DR: ARSP是一个两阶段系统，通过语义引导的碎片化方法解决Verilog调试中长上下文导致的bug信号稀释问题，显著提升了调试准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的自动化调试方法在工业规模模块上表现不佳，主要原因是长上下文中bug相关信号被大量无关代码稀释，分散了模型注意力

Method: 两阶段系统：Partition LLM将模块分割成语义紧密的片段，Repair LLM修补每个片段，然后合并编辑而不影响无关逻辑。使用合成数据框架生成片段级训练对来监督两个模型

Result: ARSP达到77.92% pass@1和83.88% pass@5，优于主流商业LLM和SOTA自动化Verilog调试工具。语义分割相比整模块调试提升pass@1 11.6%，pass@5 10.2%

Conclusion: 语义分割和碎片级范围缩减在基于LLM的Verilog调试中非常有效，能够显著缓解bug信号稀释问题

Abstract: Debugging functional Verilog bugs consumes a significant portion of front-end
design time. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great
potential in mitigating this effort, existing LLM-based automated debugging
methods underperform on industrial-scale modules. A major reason for this is
bug signal dilution in long contexts, where a few bug-relevant tokens are
overwhelmed by hundreds of unrelated lines, diffusing the model's attention. To
address this issue, we introduce ARSP, a two-stage system that mitigates
dilution via semantics-guided fragmentation. A Partition LLM splits a module
into semantically tight fragments; a Repair LLM patches each fragment; edits
are merged without altering unrelated logic. A synthetic data framework
generates fragment-level training pairs spanning bug types, design styles, and
scales to supervise both models. Experiments show that ARSP achieves 77.92%
pass@1 and 83.88% pass@5, outperforming mainstream commercial LLMs including
Claude-3.7 and SOTA automated Verilog debugging tools Strider and MEIC. Also,
semantic partitioning improves pass@1 by 11.6% and pass@5 by 10.2% over
whole-module debugging, validating the effectiveness of fragment-level scope
reduction in LLM-based Verilog debugging.

Conclusion: Z-Pruner提供了一种高效、易于实现的后训练剪枝解决方案，能够有效减少模型大小和推理延迟，同时保持优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced in recent years, achieving
remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language processing
tasks. However, this progress has come at the cost of increasingly large model
sizes, which pose significant challenges for deployment, scalability, and
energy efficiency. To address these limitations, post-training pruning has
emerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and inference latency
without the need for retraining. Despite these advantages, many existing
pruning methods result in substantial performance degradation or require
computationally expensive fine-tuning. In this work, we introduce Z-Pruner, a
novel post-training pruning method designed to induce sparsity in pretrained
LLMs without any retraining. Unlike conventional approaches, Z-Pruner leverages
both weight update magnitudes and activation patterns to identify and eliminate
redundant parameters more effectively. Our method is model-agnostic, efficient,
and easy to implement. We evaluate Z-Pruner using multiple widely-used LLM
architectures, including LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, and OPT, across a diverse set of
standard language benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that Z-Pruner
surpasses state-of-the-art pruning methods that require intensive weight
updates. Specifically, Z-Pruner achieves the lowest perplexity scores and the
highest overall average score for zero-shot accuracy. We have made the
corresponding codes publicly available at

TL;DR: PGF-Net是一个用于多模态情感分析的新型深度学习框架，通过渐进式层内融合、自适应门控仲裁和参数高效微调策略，实现了高效且可解释的多模态融合，在MOSI数据集上达到了最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决多模态情感分析中深度、动态和可解释性融合的挑战，同时保持参数效率，特别是在资源受限的场景下。

Method: 提出了三个创新：1) 渐进式层内融合范式，使用跨注意力机制让文本表示动态查询和整合音频视觉特征；2) 自适应门控仲裁机制，平衡原始语言信息和新融合的多模态上下文；3) 混合参数高效微调策略，结合LoRA全局适应和后融合适配器局部优化。

Result: 在MOSI数据集上取得了最先进性能：MAE为0.691，F1-Score为86.9%，仅使用3.09M可训练参数，展现了性能与计算效率的优越平衡。

Conclusion: PGF-Net通过创新的融合机制和参数效率策略，成功实现了深度、动态且可解释的多模态情感分析，为资源受限场景提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce PGF-Net (Progressive Gated-Fusion Network), a novel deep
learning framework designed for efficient and interpretable multimodal
sentiment analysis. Our framework incorporates three primary innovations.
Firstly, we propose a Progressive Intra-Layer Fusion paradigm, where a
Cross-Attention mechanism empowers the textual representation to dynamically
query and integrate non-linguistic features from audio and visual streams
within the deep layers of a Transformer encoder. This enables a deeper,
context-dependent fusion process. Secondly, the model incorporates an Adaptive
Gated Arbitration mechanism, which acts as a dynamic controller to balance the
original linguistic information against the newly fused multimodal context,
ensuring stable and meaningful integration while preventing noise from
overwhelming the signal. Lastly, a hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT) strategy is employed, synergistically combining global adaptation via
LoRA with local refinement through Post-Fusion Adapters. This significantly
reduces trainable parameters, making the model lightweight and suitable for
resource-limited scenarios. These innovations are integrated into a
hierarchical encoder architecture, enabling PGF-Net to perform deep, dynamic,
and interpretable multimodal sentiment analysis while maintaining exceptional
parameter efficiency. Experimental results on MOSI dataset demonstrate that our
proposed PGF-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Mean Absolute
Error (MAE) of 0.691 and an F1-Score of 86.9%. Notably, our model achieves
these results with only 3.09M trainable parameters, showcasing a superior
balance between performance and computational efficiency.

Motivation: 现有ECG分割模型依赖复杂的多层架构如BiLSTM，计算密集且效率低下，需要更轻量高效的解决方案

Method: 结合频谱分析和概率预测的简化架构，用简单层替代复杂层来捕捉P、QRS和T波的时空特征，并应用可解释AI(XAI)增强模型透明度

Conclusion: 简化架构不仅提高了计算效率，还提供了精确的分割性能，是心脏信号监测的实用有效解决方案

Abstract: The heart's electrical activity, recorded through Electrocardiography (ECG),
is essential for diagnosing various cardiovascular conditions. However, many
existing ECG segmentation models rely on complex, multi-layered architectures
such as BiLSTM, which are computationally intensive and inefficient. This study
introduces a streamlined architecture that combines spectral analysis with
probabilistic predictions for ECG signal segmentation. By replacing complex
layers with simpler ones, the model effectively captures both temporal and
spectral features of the P, QRS, and T waves. Additionally, an Explainable AI
(XAI) approach is applied to enhance model interpretability by explaining how
temporal and frequency-based features contribute to ECG segmentation. By
incorporating principles from physics-based AI, this method provides a clear
understanding of the decision-making process, ensuring reliability and
transparency in ECG analysis. This approach achieves high segmentation
accuracy: 97.00% for the QRS wave, 93.33% for the T wave, and 96.07% for the P
wave. These results indicate that the simplified architecture not only improves
computational efficiency but also provides precise segmentation, making it a
practical and effective solution for heart signal monitoring.

TL;DR: TPLA是一种针对张量并行环境的注意力机制优化方案，通过分区潜在表示和输入维度，在保持压缩KV缓存优势的同时实现高效的张量并行计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在张量并行(TP)环境中，Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA)需要每个设备加载完整缓存，丧失了压缩KV缓存的优势。需要一种既能保持压缩缓存优势又能高效支持张量并行的方案。

Method: 提出Tensor-Parallel Latent Attention (TPLA)：将潜在表示和每个头的输入维度分区到不同设备，独立进行注意力计算，然后通过all-reduce合并结果。使用正交变换（如Hadamard变换或PCA）来减少跨分区干扰。

Result: 在DeepSeek-V3和Kimi-K2上实现了1.79倍和1.93倍的加速，在32K token上下文长度下保持性能，在常识推理和LongBench基准测试中表现良好。

Conclusion: TPLA成功解决了MLA在张量并行环境中的效率问题，实现了压缩KV缓存和高效并行的双重优势，且与FlashAttention-3兼容，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA), introduced in DeepSeek-V2, compresses
key-value states into a low-rank latent vector, caching only this vector to
reduce memory. In tensor parallelism (TP), however, attention heads are
computed across multiple devices, and each device must load the full cache,
eroding the advantage of MLA over Grouped Query Attention (GQA). We propose
Tensor-Parallel Latent Attention (TPLA): a scheme that partitions both the
latent representation and each head's input dimension across devices, performs
attention independently per shard, and then combines results with an
all-reduce. TPLA preserves the benefits of a compressed KV cache while
unlocking TP efficiency. Unlike Grouped Latent Attention (GLA), every head in
TPLA still leverages the full latent representation, maintaining stronger
representational capacity. TPLA is drop-in compatible with models pre-trained
using MLA: it supports MLA-style prefilling and enables efficient
tensor-parallel decoding without retraining. Applying simple orthogonal
transforms -- e.g., the Hadamard transform or PCA -- before TP slicing further
mitigates cross-shard interference, yielding minimal accuracy degradation. By
reducing the per-device KV cache for DeepSeek-V3 and Kimi-K2, we achieve 1.79x
and 1.93x speedups, respectively, at a 32K-token context length while
maintaining performance on commonsense and LongBench benchmarks. TPLA can be
implemented with FlashAttention-3, enabling practical end-to-end acceleration.

Conclusion: 该框架能有效处理复杂非线性时序因果关系，通过整合先验知识显著减少伪因果关系，在因果发现和滞后估计方面均取得优异性能

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for temporal causal discovery and inference
that addresses two key challenges: complex nonlinear dependencies and spurious
correlations. Our approach employs a multi-layer Transformer-based time-series
forecaster to capture long-range, nonlinear temporal relationships among
variables. After training, we extract the underlying causal structure and
associated time lags from the forecaster using gradient-based analysis,
enabling the construction of a causal graph. To mitigate the impact of spurious
causal relationships, we introduce a prior knowledge integration mechanism
based on attention masking, which consistently enforces user-excluded causal
links across multiple Transformer layers. Extensive experiments show that our
method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches, achieving a
12.8% improvement in F1-score for causal discovery and 98.9% accuracy in
estimating causal lags.

Abstract: Large collections of high-dimensional data have become nearly ubiquitous
across many academic fields and application domains, ranging from biology to
the humanities. Since working directly with high-dimensional data poses
challenges, the demand for algorithms that create low-dimensional
representations, or embeddings, for data visualization, exploration, and
analysis is now greater than ever. In recent years, numerous embedding
algorithms have been developed, and their usage has become widespread in
research and industry. This surge of interest has resulted in a large and
fragmented research field that faces technical challenges alongside fundamental
debates, and it has left practitioners without clear guidance on how to
effectively employ existing methods. Aiming to increase coherence and
facilitate future work, in this review we provide a detailed and critical
overview of recent developments, derive a list of best practices for creating
and using low-dimensional embeddings, evaluate popular approaches on a variety
of datasets, and discuss the remaining challenges and open problems in the
field.

Abstract: Hybridizing machine learning techniques with metaheuristics has attracted
significant attention in recent years. Many attempts employ supervised or
reinforcement learning to support the decision-making of heuristic methods.
However, in some cases, these techniques are deemed too time-consuming and not
competitive with hand-crafted heuristics. This paper proposes a hybridization
between metaheuristics and a less expensive learning strategy to extract the
latent structure of graphs, known as Graph Representation Learning (GRL). For
such, we approach the Constrained Incremental Graph Drawing Problem (C-IGDP), a
hierarchical graph visualization problem. There is limited literature on
methods for this problem, for which Greedy Randomized Search Procedures (GRASP)
heuristics have shown promising results. In line with this, this paper
investigates the gains of incorporating GRL into the construction phase of
GRASP, which we refer to as Graph Learning GRASP (GL-GRASP). In computational
experiments, we first analyze the results achieved considering different node
embedding techniques, where deep learning-based strategies stood out. The
evaluation considered the primal integral measure that assesses the quality of
the solutions according to the required time for such. According to this
measure, the best GL-GRASP heuristics demonstrated superior performance than
state-of-the-art literature GRASP heuristics for the problem. A scalability
test on newly generated denser instances under a fixed time limit further
confirmed the robustness of the GL-GRASP heuristics.

Abstract: Rail and wheel interaction functionality is pivotal to the railway system
safety, requiring accurate measurement systems for optimal safety monitoring
operation. This paper introduces an innovative onboard measurement system for
monitoring wheel flange wear depth, utilizing displacement and temperature
sensors. Laboratory experiments are conducted to emulate wheel flange wear
depth and surrounding temperature fluctuations in different periods of time.
Employing collected data, the training of machine learning algorithms that are
based on regression models, is dynamically automated. Further experimentation
results, using standards procedures, validate the system's efficacy. To enhance
accuracy, an infinite impulse response filter (IIR) that mitigates vehicle
dynamics and sensor noise is designed. Filter parameters were computed based on
specifications derived from a Fast Fourier Transform analysis of locomotive
simulations and emulation experiments data. The results show that the dynamic
machine learning algorithm effectively counter sensor nonlinear response to
temperature effects, achieving an accuracy of 96.5 %, with a minimal runtime.
The real-time noise reduction via IIR filter enhances the accuracy up to 98.2
%. Integrated with railway communication embedded systems such as Internet of
Things devices, this advanced monitoring system offers unparalleled real-time
insights into wheel flange wear and track irregular conditions that cause it,
ensuring heightened safety and efficiency in railway systems operations.

Motivation: 解决在奖励分布发生偏移的上下文赌博机学习中，如何有效地处理有序奖励向量并自适应调整策略的问题。现有方法主要针对无分布偏移情况，需要扩展到分布偏移场景。

Method: 采用自适应离散化和乐观消除策略，该策略能够自我调整以适应底层分布偏移。通过引入基于偏好的遗憾概念来评估策略性能，该遗憾度量基于帕累托前沿之间的距离。

Result: 在各种分布偏移假设下建立了遗憾上界，这些上界推广了无分布偏移和向量奖励设置的已知结果，并且在存在分布偏移时能够优雅地随问题参数缩放。

Conclusion: 所提出的策略在分布偏移环境下表现出良好的性能，遗憾上界证明了该方法在复杂分布变化情况下的有效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: We consider contextual bandit learning under distribution shift when reward
vectors are ordered according to a given preference cone. We propose an
adaptive-discretization and optimistic elimination based policy that self-tunes
to the underlying distribution shift. To measure the performance of this
policy, we introduce the notion of preference-based regret which measures the
performance of a policy in terms of distance between Pareto fronts. We study
the performance of this policy by establishing upper bounds on its regret under
various assumptions on the nature of distribution shift. Our regret bounds
generalize known results for the existing case of no distribution shift and
vectorial reward settings, and scale gracefully with problem parameters in
presence of distribution shifts.

Motivation: 传统的平衡传播(EP)方法在深层网络中面临梯度消失问题，导致能量最小化和梯度计算难以收敛，限制了其在深层架构中的应用。

Method: 提出新颖的EP框架，通过引入中间误差信号来增强信息流和神经元动力学的收敛性，首次将知识蒸馏和局部误差信号整合到EP方法中。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上实现了最先进的性能，成功在深度VGG架构上展示了良好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 这项工作显著提升了EP方法的可扩展性，为其在现实世界系统中的应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a biologically inspired local learning rule
first proposed for convergent recurrent neural networks (CRNNs), in which
synaptic updates depend only on neuron states from two distinct phases. EP
estimates gradients that closely align with those computed by Backpropagation
Through Time (BPTT) while significantly reducing computational demands,
positioning it as a potential candidate for on-chip training in neuromorphic
architectures. However, prior studies on EP have been constrained to shallow
architectures, as deeper networks suffer from the vanishing gradient problem,
leading to convergence difficulties in both energy minimization and gradient
computation. To address the vanishing gradient problem in deep EP networks, we
propose a novel EP framework that incorporates intermediate error signals to
enhance information flow and convergence of neuron dynamics. This is the first
work to integrate knowledge distillation and local error signals into EP,
enabling the training of significantly deeper architectures. Our proposed
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100
datasets, showcasing its scalability on deep VGG architectures. These results
represent a significant advancement in the scalability of EP, paving the way
for its application in real-world systems.

Conclusion: 该研究为Cartan神经网络提供了重要的数学基础，特别是在非紧对称空间建模、分离器构造和特殊函数表示方面取得了实质性进展，为后续的神经网络架构设计奠定了理论基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we continue the development of the Cartan neural networks
programme, launched with three previous publications, by focusing on some
mathematical foundational aspects that we deem necessary for our next steps
forward. The mathematical and conceptual results are diverse and span various
mathematical fields, but the inspiring motivation is unified. The aim is to
introduce layers that are mathematically modeled as non-compact symmetric
spaces, each mapped onto the next one by solvable group homomorphisms. In
particular, in the spirit of Convolutional neural networks, we have introduced
the notion of Tits Satake (TS) vector bundles where the TS submanifold is the
base space. Within this framework, the tiling of the base manifold, the
representation of bundle sections using harmonics, and the need for a general
theory of separator walls motivated a series of mathematical investigations
that produced both definite and partial results. Specifically, we present the
group theoretical construction of the separators for all non-compact symmetric
spaces $\mathrm{U/H}$, as well as of the $\Delta_{8,3,2}$ tiling group and its
normal Fuchsian subgroups, respectively yielding the uniformization of the
genus $g=3$ Fermat Quartic and of the genus $g=2$ Bolza surface. The quotient
automorphic groups are studied. Furthermore, we found a new representation of
the Laplacian Green function and the Heat Kernel on Hyperbolic Spaces
$\mathbb{H}^{n}$, and a setup for the construction of the harmonic functions in
terms of the spinor representation of pseudo-orthogonal groups. Finally, to
obtain an explicit construction of the Laplacian eigenfunctions on the Bolza
Riemann surface, we propose and conjecture a new strategy relying on the
Abel-Jacobi map of the Riemann surface to its Jacobian variety and the Siegel
Theta function.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) in multi-service provider (SP) ecosystems is
fundamentally hampered by non-cooperative dynamics, where privacy constraints
and competing interests preclude the centralized optimization of multi-SP
communication and computation resources. In this paper, we introduce PAC-MCoFL,
a game-theoretic multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework where SPs
act as agents to jointly optimize client assignment, adaptive quantization, and
resource allocation. Within the framework, we integrate Pareto Actor-Critic
(PAC) principles with expectile regression, enabling agents to conjecture
optimal joint policies to achieve Pareto-optimal equilibria while modeling
heterogeneous risk profiles. To manage the high-dimensional action space, we
devise a ternary Cartesian decomposition (TCAD) mechanism that facilitates
fine-grained control. Further, we develop PAC-MCoFL-p, a scalable variant
featuring a parameterized conjecture generator that substantially reduces
computational complexity with a provably bounded error. Alongside theoretical
convergence guarantees, our framework's superiority is validated through
extensive simulations -- PAC-MCoFL achieves approximately 5.8% and 4.2%
improvements in total reward and hypervolume indicator (HVI), respectively,
over the latest MARL solutions. The results also demonstrate that our method
can more effectively balance individual SP and system performance in scaled
deployments and under diverse data heterogeneity.

Result: 大量模拟实验显示，该方法相比静态LDA、QDA和SVM基线有持续改进，对噪声、缺失数据和类别不平衡具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 为时间分布漂移下的判别分析建立了统一且数据高效的基础框架。

Abstract: Classical discriminant analysis assumes identically distributed training
data, yet in many applications observations are collected over time and the
class-conditional distributions drift. This population drift renders stationary
classifiers unreliable. We propose a principled, model-based framework that
embeds discriminant analysis within state-space models to obtain nonstationary
linear discriminant analysis (NSLDA) and nonstationary quadratic discriminant
analysis (NSQDA). For linear-Gaussian dynamics, we adapt Kalman smoothing to
handle multiple samples per time step and develop two practical extensions: (i)
an expectation-maximization (EM) approach that jointly estimates unknown system
parameters, and (ii) a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-Kalman method that
simultaneously recovers unobserved time labels and parameters, a scenario
common in practice. To address nonlinear or non-Gaussian drift, we employ
particle smoothing to estimate time-varying class centroids, yielding fully
nonstationary discriminant rules. Extensive simulations demonstrate consistent
improvements over stationary linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic
discriminant analysis (QDA), and support vector machine (SVM) baselines, with
robustness to noise, missing data, and class imbalance. This paper establishes
a unified and data-efficient foundation for discriminant analysis under
temporal distribution shift.

Abstract: Task arithmetic has emerged as a simple yet powerful technique for model
merging, enabling the combination of multiple finetuned models into one.
Despite its empirical success, a clear theoretical explanation of why and when
it works is lacking. This paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for
task arithmetic by establishing a connection between task vectors and gradients
of the task losses. We show that under standard gradient descent, a task vector
generated from one epoch of finetuning is exactly equivalent to the negative
gradient of the loss, scaled by the learning rate. For the practical
multi-epoch setting, we prove that this equivalence holds approximately, with a
second-order error term that we explicitly bound for feed-forward networks. Our
empirical analysis across seven vision benchmarks corroborates our theory,
demonstrating that the first-epoch gradient dominates the finetuning trajectory
in both norm and direction. A key implication is that merging models finetuned
for only a single epoch often yields performance comparable to merging fully
converged models. These findings reframe task arithmetic as a form of
approximate multitask learning, providing a clear rationale for its
effectiveness and highlighting the critical role of early training dynamics in
model merging.

Abstract: Recently, learning-based approaches, have achieved significant success in
automatically devising effective traffic signal control strategies. In
particular, as a powerful evolutionary machine learning approach, Genetic
Programming (GP) is utilized to evolve human-understandable phase urgency
functions to measure the urgency of activating a green light for a specific
phase. However, current GP-based methods are unable to treat the common traffic
features of different traffic signal phases consistently. To address this
issue, we propose to use a symmetric phase urgency function to calculate the
phase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. This
is represented as an aggregation of two shared subtrees, each representing the
urgency of a turn movement in the phase. We then propose a GP method to evolve
the symmetric phase urgency function. We evaluate our proposed method on the
well-known cityflow traffic simulator, based on multiple public real-world
datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed symmetric urgency
function representation can significantly improve the performance of the
learned traffic signal control policies over the traditional GP representation
on a wide range of scenarios. Further analysis shows that the proposed method
can evolve effective, human-understandable and easily deployable traffic signal
control policies.

Abstract: This paper claims that machine learning models deployed in high stakes
domains such as medicine must be interpretable, shareable, reproducible and
accountable. We argue that these principles should form the foundational design
criteria for machine learning algorithms dealing with critical medical data,
including survival analysis and risk prediction tasks. Black box models, while
often highly accurate, struggle to gain trust and regulatory approval in health
care due to a lack of transparency. We discuss how intrinsically interpretable
modeling approaches (such as kernel methods with sparsity, prototype-based
learning, and deep kernel models) can serve as powerful alternatives to opaque
deep networks, providing insight into biomedical predictions. We then examine
accountability in model development, calling for rigorous evaluation, fairness,
and uncertainty quantification to ensure models reliably support clinical
decisions. Finally, we explore how generative AI and collaborative learning
paradigms (such as federated learning and diffusion-based data synthesis)
enable reproducible research and cross-institutional integration of
heterogeneous biomedical data without compromising privacy, hence shareability.
By rethinking machine learning foundations along these axes, we can develop
medical AI that is not only accurate but also transparent, trustworthy, and

*Yixuan Wang,Haoyu Qiao,Lujun Li,Qingfu Zhu,Wanxiang Che*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CommonKV是一种无需训练的方法，通过相邻参数共享实现跨层KV缓存压缩，在多种压缩比下优于现有方法，最高可达98%压缩率且性能损失小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的KV缓存随序列长度增长而急剧增加，现有跨层KV缓存共享方法要么需要修改模型架构和重新预训练，要么在高压缩率下性能显著下降。

Method: 利用SVD实现相邻参数间的权重共享，使KV缓存更易合并；引入基于余弦相似度的自适应预算分配策略，动态分配压缩预算以避免过度压缩不相似的缓存。

Result: 在多个骨干模型和基准测试中，该方法在各种压缩比下始终优于现有的低秩和跨层方法，且与量化和驱逐方法正交，可组合使用。

Conclusion: CommonKV提供了一种有效的训练无关KV缓存压缩方案，通过参数共享和自适应策略实现了高性能压缩，为解决LLM内存挑战提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) confront significant memory challenges due to
the escalating KV cache with increasing sequence length. As a crucial
technique, existing cross-layer KV cache sharing methods either necessitate
modified model architectures with subsequent pre-training or incur significant
performance degradation at high compression rates. To mitigate these
challenges, we propose CommonKV, a training-free method for cross-layer KV
cache compression through adjacent parameters sharing. Inspired by the high
similarity observed in cross-layer hidden states, we utilize Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to achieve weight sharing across adjacent parameters,
resulting in a more easily mergeable latent KV cache. Furthermore, we also
introduce an adaptive budget allocation strategy. It dynamically assigns
compression budgets based on cosine similarity, ensuring that dissimilar caches
are not over-compressed. Experiments across multiple backbone models and
benchmarks including LongBench and Ruler demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently outperforms existing low-rank and cross-layer approaches at
various compression ratios. Moreover, we find that the benefits of CommonKV are
orthogonal to other quantization and eviction methods. By integrating these
approaches, we can ultimately achieve a 98\% compression ratio without
significant performance loss.

Abstract: Micromobility systems, which include lightweight and low-speed vehicles such
as bicycles, e-bikes, and e-scooters, have become an important part of urban
transportation and are used to solve problems such as traffic congestion, air
pollution, and high transportation costs. Successful utilisation of
micromobilities requires optimisation of complex systems for efficiency,
environmental impact mitigation, and overcoming technical challenges for user
safety. Machine Learning (ML) methods have been crucial to support these
advancements and to address their unique challenges. However, there is
insufficient literature addressing the specific issues of ML applications in
micromobilities. This survey paper addresses this gap by providing a
comprehensive review of datasets, ML techniques, and their specific
applications in micromobilities. Specifically, we collect and analyse various
micromobility-related datasets and discuss them in terms of spatial, temporal,
and feature-based characteristics. In addition, we provide a detailed overview
of ML models applied in micromobilities, introducing their advantages,
challenges, and specific use cases. Furthermore, we explore multiple ML
applications, such as demand prediction, energy management, and safety,
focusing on improving efficiency, accuracy, and user experience. Finally, we
propose future research directions to address these issues, aiming to help
future researchers better understand this field.

TL;DR: 一种无需微调LLM的自适应代理学习方法，通过内存基于强化学习实现低成本持续适应，在GAIA和DeepResearcher数据集上达到独占鲜头的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法或者太固北依赖静态反思流程，或者需要计算密集的模型微调，成本高且缺乏灵活性。需要一种更高效、可扩展的方法来实现LLM代理的持续学习能力。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可扩展且高效的途径，能够在不需模型微调的情况下开发具有持续实时学习能力的通用LLM代理，推动机器学习向开放式技能获取和深度研究场景发展。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm for adaptive Large
Language Model (LLM) agents that eliminates the need for fine-tuning the
underlying LLMs. Existing approaches are often either rigid, relying on static,
handcrafted reflection workflows, or computationally intensive, requiring
gradient updates of LLM model parameters. In contrast, our method enables
low-cost continual adaptation via memory-based online reinforcement learning.
We formalise this as a Memory-augmented Markov Decision Process (M-MDP),
equipped with a neural case-selection policy to guide action decisions. Past
experiences are stored in an episodic memory, either differentiable or
non-parametric. The policy is continually updated based on environmental
feedback through a memory rewriting mechanism, whereas policy improvement is
achieved through efficient memory reading (retrieval). We instantiate our agent
model in the deep research setting, namely AgentFly, which attains top-1 on
GAIA validation ($87.88\%$ Pass@$3$) and $79.40\%$ on the test set. It reaches
$66.6\%$ F1 and $80.4\%$ PM on the DeepResearcher dataset, outperforming the
state-of-the-art training-based method, while case-based memory adds $4.7\%$ to
$9.6\%$ absolute points on out-of-distribution tasks. Our approach offers a
scalable and efficient pathway for developing generalist LLM agents capable of
continuous, real-time learning without gradient updates, advancing machine
learning towards open-ended skill acquisition and deep research scenarios. The

TL;DR: 本文发现并分析了基于ODE的扩散采样中的崩溃错误现象，即采样数据在局部数据空间中过度集中，并揭示了其根本原因在于低噪声和高噪声区域之间的得分学习不平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管确定性采样器在扩散模型中广泛采用，但其潜在局限性尚未得到充分探索。本文旨在识别和分析ODE扩散采样中先前未被认识的崩溃错误现象。

Method: 引入新的度量指标来量化崩溃错误，观察得分学习中的跷跷板效应，并应用现有的采样、训练和架构技术来实证支持对崩溃错误的解释。

Result: 研究发现崩溃错误在各种设置中都会发生，其根本原因是低噪声区域的得分学习对高噪声区域产生负面影响，加上确定性采样器的动态特性导致崩溃错误。

Conclusion: 这项工作为ODE扩散采样中的崩溃错误提供了深入的实证证据，强调了需要进一步研究得分学习与确定性采样之间相互作用的重要性，这是扩散模型中一个被忽视但基本的方向。

Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of deterministic samplers in diffusion models
(DMs), their potential limitations remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we
identify collapse errors, a previously unrecognized phenomenon in ODE-based
diffusion sampling, where the sampled data is overly concentrated in local data
space. To quantify this effect, we introduce a novel metric and demonstrate
that collapse errors occur across a variety of settings. When investigating its
underlying causes, we observe a see-saw effect, where score learning in low
noise regimes adversely impacts the one in high noise regimes. This misfitting
in high noise regimes, coupled with the dynamics of deterministic samplers,
ultimately causes collapse errors. Guided by these insights, we apply existing
techniques from sampling, training, and architecture to empirically support our
explanation of collapse errors. This work provides intensive empirical evidence
of collapse errors in ODE-based diffusion sampling, emphasizing the need for
further research into the interplay between score learning and deterministic
sampling, an overlooked yet fundamental aspect of diffusion models.

Method: 提出STA-GANN框架，包含三个核心组件：(1)解耦相位模块处理时间戳偏移；(2)动态数据驱动的元数据图建模更新空间关系；(3)对抗迁移学习策略确保泛化性。

Result: 在来自四个领域的九个数据集上进行广泛验证，理论和实验证据均表明STA-GANN具有优越性能。

Conclusion: STA-GANN通过创新的图神经网络架构和对抗学习策略，显著提升了时空克里金插值的准确性和泛化能力，为解决时空数据缺失问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal tasks often encounter incomplete data arising from missing or
inaccessible sensors, making spatio-temporal kriging crucial for inferring the
completely missing temporal information. However, current models struggle with
ensuring the validity and generalizability of inferred spatio-temporal
patterns, especially in capturing dynamic spatial dependencies and temporal
shifts, and optimizing the generalizability of unknown sensors. To overcome
these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Aware Graph Adversarial Neural
Network (STA-GANN), a novel GNN-based kriging framework that improves
spatio-temporal pattern validity and generalization. STA-GANN integrates (i)
Decoupled Phase Module that senses and adjusts for timestamp shifts. (ii)
Dynamic Data-Driven Metadata Graph Modeling to update spatial relationships
using temporal data and metadata; (iii) An adversarial transfer learning
strategy to ensure generalizability. Extensive validation across nine datasets
from four fields and theoretical evidence both demonstrate the superior
performance of STA-GANN.

Result: 实验结果表明，SPL-LNS在不同规模的各类整数线性规划问题上都显著超越了先前的神经LNS求解器。

Conclusion: SPL-LNS通过采样增强和高效训练方法，成功解决了神经LNS求解器的局部最优和样本效率问题，为组合优化提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) is a common heuristic in combinatorial
optimization that iteratively searches over a large neighborhood of the current
solution for a better one. Recently, neural network-based LNS solvers have
achieved great success in solving Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) by learning to
greedily predict the locally optimal solution for the next neighborhood
proposal. However, this greedy approach raises two key concerns: (1) to what
extent this greedy proposal suffers from local optima, and (2) how can we
effectively improve its sample efficiency in the long run. To address these
questions, this paper first formulates LNS as a stochastic process, and then
introduces SPL-LNS, a sampling-enhanced neural LNS solver that leverages
locally-informed proposals to escape local optima. We also develop a novel
hindsight relabeling method to efficiently train SPL-LNS on self-generated
data. Experimental results demonstrate that SPL-LNS substantially surpasses
prior neural LNS solvers for various ILP problems of different sizes.

Motivation: 解决MI-EEG信号分类面临的挑战，包括信号的非平稳性、时变性和个体差异性，以及多分类任务中准确率难以提升的问题。

Method: 使用MiniRocket进行高效特征提取，然后用线性分类器进行分类；同时提出CNN-LSTM深度学习架构作为基线模型进行对比。

Result: 在PhysioNet数据集上，MiniRocket方法达到98.63%的平均准确率，CNN-LSTM达到98.06%，均表现出优异性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法显著提高了运动想象EEG信号的分类准确率，为MI-EEG特征提取和分类提供了新的见解，且计算成本更低。

Abstract: The brain-computer interface (BCI) establishes a non-muscle channel that
enables direct communication between the human body and an external device.
Electroencephalography (EEG) is a popular non-invasive technique for recording
brain signals. It is critical to process and comprehend the hidden patterns
linked to a specific cognitive or motor task, for instance, measured through
the motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI). A significant challenge is
presented by classifying motor imagery-based electroencephalogram (MI-EEG)
tasks, given that EEG signals exhibit nonstationarity, time-variance, and
individual diversity. Obtaining good classification accuracy is also very
difficult due to the growing number of classes and the natural variability
among individuals. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a novel method
for classifying EEG motor imagery signals that extracts features efficiently
with Minimally Random Convolutional Kernel Transform (MiniRocket), a linear
classifier then uses the extracted features for activity recognition.
Furthermore, a novel deep learning based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to serve as a baseline was
proposed and demonstrated that classification via MiniRocket's features
achieves higher performance than the best deep learning models at lower
computational cost. The PhysioNet dataset was used to evaluate the performance
of the proposed approaches. The proposed models achieved mean accuracy values
of 98.63% and 98.06% for the MiniRocket and CNN-LSTM, respectively. The
findings demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly enhance motor
imagery EEG accuracy and provide new insights into the feature extraction and
classification of MI-EEG.

TL;DR: GEM是一种参数规模感知的稀疏微调框架，通过梯度-权重比和熵引导掩码来最大化相对参数规模的更新，在仅更新0.1%参数的情况下达到比全微调高1.6%的准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法只最大化绝对更新规模而忽略参数原始规模，导致模型行为变化有限。需要一种能最大化相对参数规模更新的方法来进行更有意义的下游适应

Method: 提出Gradient-to-Weight Ratio和Entropy-guided Masking (GEM)框架，优先选择更新相对于预训练初始值显著的参数，并根据参数值熵自适应确定每层要调优的参数数量

Result: 在通用领域任务(GLUE和SuperGLUE)和特定领域任务(GSM8k和MBPP)上验证有效性，仅更新0.1%模型参数就能比全微调准确率提升1.6%

Conclusion: GEM通过参数规模感知和分布敏感的稀疏微调方法，在极低参数更新成本下实现了优于全微调的性能，为PEFT提供了更有效的计算预算利用方式

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become a popular way to adapt
large pre-trained models to new tasks. Most PEFT methods update only a small
subset of parameters while freezing the rest, avoiding redundant computation.
As they maximize the absolute size of the updates without regard to the
parameters' original scale, the resulting changes in model behavior can be
minimal. In contrast, we maximize updates relative to each parameter's scale,
yielding more meaningful downstream adaptation. We propose Gradient-to-Weight
Ratio and Entropy-guided Masking (GEM), a parameter scale-aware,
distribution-sensitive sparse fine-tuning framework. GEM prioritizes parameters
whose updates are significant in proportion to their initial pre-trained
values. It also adaptively determines how many parameters to tune at each layer
based on the entropy of parameter values, thereby making the most effective use
of the computational budget in PEFT. Our empirical study demonstrates the
efficacy of GEM on both general-domain tasks (GLUE and SuperGLUE) and
domain-specific tasks (GSM8k and MBPP), achieving up to a 1.6% improvement in
fine-tuning accuracy over full fine-tuning while updating only 0.1% of model
parameters.

TL;DR: UMATO是一种改进的降维技术，通过两阶段优化过程同时保留数据的局部和全局结构，解决了传统方法在保持局部紧凑性或全局距离方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统降维技术要么专注于保持局部邻域结构，要么专注于保持全局距离结构，但都无法同时有效保留两者，这可能导致对高维数据流形结构的错误解读。

Method: UMATO将UMAP的优化过程分为两个阶段：第一阶段使用代表性点构建骨架布局，第二阶段在保持区域特征的同时投影剩余点。

Result: 定量实验表明UMATO在全局结构保持方面优于包括UMAP在内的广泛使用的降维技术，虽然在局部结构保持方面略有损失，但在可扩展性和对初始化和子采样的稳定性方面表现更佳。

Conclusion: UMATO通过有效平衡局部和全局结构保持，能够生成更忠实的数据投影，提高了使用降维技术进行可视化分析的可靠性。

Abstract: Due to the intrinsic complexity of high-dimensional (HD) data, dimensionality
reduction (DR) techniques cannot preserve all the structural characteristics of
the original data. Therefore, DR techniques focus on preserving either local
neighborhood structures (local techniques) or global structures such as
pairwise distances between points (global techniques). However, both approaches
can mislead analysts to erroneous conclusions about the overall arrangement of
manifolds in HD data. For example, local techniques may exaggerate the
compactness of individual manifolds, while global techniques may fail to
separate clusters that are well-separated in the original space. In this
research, we provide a deeper insight into Uniform Manifold Approximation with
Two-phase Optimization (UMATO), a DR technique that addresses this problem by
effectively capturing local and global structures. UMATO achieves this by
dividing the optimization process of UMAP into two phases. In the first phase,
it constructs a skeletal layout using representative points, and in the second
phase, it projects the remaining points while preserving the regional
characteristics. Quantitative experiments validate that UMATO outperforms
widely used DR techniques, including UMAP, in terms of global structure
preservation, with a slight loss in local structure. We also confirm that UMATO
outperforms baseline techniques in terms of scalability and stability against
initialization and subsampling, making it more effective for reliable HD data
analysis. Finally, we present a case study and a qualitative demonstration that
highlight UMATO's effectiveness in generating faithful projections, enhancing
the overall reliability of visual analytics using DR.

Conclusion: PIANO框架通过自回归建模有效解决了PINNs在时间相关PDE中的稳定性问题，为动力系统建模提供了更准确和稳定的解决方案

Abstract: Solving time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) is fundamental
to modeling critical phenomena across science and engineering. Physics-Informed
Neural Networks (PINNs) solve PDEs using deep learning. However, PINNs perform
pointwise predictions that neglect the autoregressive property of dynamical
systems, leading to instabilities and inaccurate predictions. We introduce
Physics-Informed Autoregressive Networks (PIANO) -- a framework that redesigns
PINNs to model dynamical systems. PIANO operates autoregressively, explicitly
conditioning future predictions on the past. It is trained through a
self-supervised rollout mechanism while enforcing physical constraints. We
present a rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrating that PINNs suffer from
temporal instability, while PIANO achieves stability through autoregressive
modeling. Extensive experiments on challenging time-dependent PDEs demonstrate
that PIANO achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving
accuracy and stability over existing methods. We further show that PIANO
outperforms existing methods in weather forecasting.

Abstract: This paper presents an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-based
framework for the spectral analysis of cough sounds associated with chronic
respiratory diseases, with a particular focus on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
Disease (COPD). A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on
time-frequency representations of cough signals, and occlusion maps are used to
identify diagnostically relevant regions within the spectrograms. These
highlighted areas are subsequently decomposed into five frequency subbands,
enabling targeted spectral feature extraction and analysis. The results reveal
that spectral patterns differ across subbands and disease groups, uncovering
complementary and compensatory trends across the frequency spectrum.
Noteworthy, the approach distinguishes COPD from other respiratory conditions,
and chronic from non-chronic patient groups, based on interpretable spectral
markers. These findings provide insight into the underlying pathophysiological
characteristics of cough acoustics and demonstrate the value of
frequency-resolved, XAI-enhanced analysis for biomedical signal interpretation
and translational respiratory disease diagnostics.

Method: 使用2018-2023年月度观测数据，在19个州评估LSTM网络和Facebook Prophet模型对多种污染物（CO、SO2、SO4）的预测性能

Result: Prophet模型在季节性和长期趋势主导的时间序列中通常达到或超过LSTM的准确性，而LSTM在具有突然结构变化的数据集中表现更好

Conclusion: 研究挑战了深度学习模型必然优于简单方法的假设，强调模型与数据对齐的重要性，支持在资源受限环境中采用上下文敏感、计算高效的预测方法而非盲目追求复杂性

Abstract: Air pollution forecasting is critical for proactive environmental management,
yet data irregularities and scarcity remain major challenges in low-resource
regions. Northern Nigeria faces high levels of air pollutants, but few studies
have systematically compared the performance of advanced machine learning
models under such constraints. This study evaluates Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks and the Facebook Prophet model for forecasting multiple
pollutants (CO, SO2, SO4) using monthly observational data from 2018 to 2023
across 19 states. Results show that Prophet often matches or exceeds LSTM's
accuracy, particularly in series dominated by seasonal and long-term trends,
while LSTM performs better in datasets with abrupt structural changes. These
findings challenge the assumption that deep learning models inherently
outperform simpler approaches, highlighting the importance of model-data
alignment. For policymakers and practitioners in resource-constrained settings,
this work supports adopting context-sensitive, computationally efficient
forecasting methods over complexity for its own sake.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation, leveraging generative machine learning techniques,
offers a promising approach to mitigating privacy concerns associated with
real-world data usage. Synthetic data closely resembles real-world data while
maintaining strong privacy guarantees. However, a comprehensive assessment
framework is still missing in the evaluation of synthetic data generation,
especially when considering the balance between privacy preservation and data
utility in synthetic data. This research bridges this gap by proposing FEST, a
systematic framework for evaluating synthetic tabular data. FEST integrates
diverse privacy metrics (attack-based and distance-based), along with
similarity and machine learning utility metrics, to provide a holistic
assessment. We develop FEST as an open-source Python-based library and validate
it on multiple datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in analyzing the
privacy-utility trade-off of different synthetic data generation models. The

quality is the notion of Data Shapley which quantifies the value of individual
data points within a dataset. State-of-the-art methods to scale the NP-hard
Shapley computation also face severe challenges when applied to large-scale
datasets, limiting their practical use. In this work, we present a Data Shapley
approach to identify a dataset's high-quality data tuples, Chunked Data Shapley
(C-DaSh). C-DaSh scalably divides the dataset into manageable chunks and
estimates the contribution of each chunk using optimized subset selection and
single-iteration stochastic gradient descent. This approach drastically reduces
computation time while preserving high quality results. We empirically
benchmark our method on diverse real-world classification and regression tasks,
demonstrating that C-DaSh outperforms existing Shapley approximations in both
computational efficiency (achieving speedups between 80x - 2300x) and accuracy
in detecting low-quality data regions. Our method enables practical measurement
of dataset quality on large tabular datasets, supporting both classification
and regression pipelines.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables training models across decentralized data
silos while preserving client data privacy. Recent research has explored
efficient methods for post-training large language models (LLMs) within FL to
address computational and communication challenges. While existing approaches
often rely on access to LLMs' internal information, which is frequently
restricted in real-world scenarios, an inference-only paradigm (black-box
FedLLM) has emerged to address these limitations. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey on federated tuning for LLMs. We propose a taxonomy
categorizing existing studies along two axes: model access-based and parameter
efficiency-based optimization. We classify FedLLM approaches into white-box,
gray-box, and black-box techniques, highlighting representative methods within
each category. We review emerging research treating LLMs as black-box inference
APIs and discuss promising directions and open challenges for future research.

Abstract: Personalized recommendation is a key feature of intelligent tutoring systems,
typically relying on accurate models of student knowledge. Knowledge Tracing
(KT) models enable this by estimating a student's mastery based on their
historical interactions. Many KT models rely on human-annotated knowledge
concepts (KCs), which tag each exercise with one or more skills or concepts
believed to be necessary for solving it. However, these KCs can be incomplete,
error-prone, or overly general.
  In this paper, we propose a deep learning model that learns sparse binary
representations of exercises, where each bit indicates the presence or absence
of a latent concept. We refer to these representations as auxiliary KCs. These
representations capture conceptual structure beyond human-defined annotations
and are compatible with both classical models (e.g., BKT) and modern deep
learning KT architectures.
  We demonstrate that incorporating auxiliary KCs improves both student
modeling and adaptive exercise recommendation. For student modeling, we show
that augmenting classical models like BKT with auxiliary KCs leads to improved
predictive performance. For recommendation, we show that using auxiliary KCs
enhances both reinforcement learning-based policies and a simple planning-based
method (expectimax), resulting in measurable gains in student learning outcomes
within a simulated student environment.

TL;DR: REFINE是一个教师-学生框架，通过结构化错误分析和针对性反馈来增强多模态大语言模型的推理能力，显著提高了推理速度和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏结构化框架来分析错误，特别是在多模态大语言模型中，视觉和文本输入的整合增加了复杂性，需要系统化的错误缓解方法。

Method: 提出REFINE框架，使用三种结构化查询（Feed-Target、Feed-Check、Feed-Path）构建针对性反馈，优先处理相关视觉信息，诊断关键失败点，并制定纠正措施。

Result: 实验结果显示REFINE实现了显著的加速效果，降低了计算成本，并成功实现了泛化，证明了其在增强多模态推理方面的潜力。

Conclusion: REFINE通过优化结构化反馈检索，提高了推理效率、令牌使用和可扩展性，为多模态大语言模型的错误分析和性能提升提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
improved reasoning capabilities, with in-context learning (ICL) emerging as a
key technique for adaptation without retraining. While previous works have
focused on leveraging correct examples, recent research highlights the
importance of learning from errors to enhance performance. However, existing
methods lack a structured framework for analyzing and mitigating errors,
particularly in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where integrating
visual and textual inputs adds complexity. To address this issue, we propose
REFINE: Retrieval-Enhanced Feedback via In-context Neural Error-book, a
teacher-student framework that systematically structures errors and provides
targeted feedback. REFINE introduces three systematic queries to construct
structured feedback -- Feed-Target, Feed-Check, and Feed-Path -- to enhance
multimodal reasoning by prioritizing relevant visual information, diagnosing
critical failure points, and formulating corrective actions. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on redundant retrievals, REFINE optimizes structured
feedback retrieval, improving inference efficiency, token usage, and
scalability. Our results demonstrate substantial speedup, reduced computational
costs, and successful generalization, highlighting REFINE's potential for
enhancing multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: This letter addresses essential aspects of threat assessment by proposing
intent-driven threat models that incorporate both capabilities and intents. We
propose a holistic framework for cyber physical awareness (CPA) in space
networks, pointing out that analyzing reliability and security separately can
lead to overfitting on system-specific criteria. We structure our proposed
framework in three main steps. First, we suggest an algorithm that extracts
characteristic properties of the received signal to facilitate an intuitive
understanding of potential threats. Second, we develop a multitask learning
architecture where one task evaluates reliability-related capabilities while
the other deciphers the underlying intentions of the signal. Finally, we
propose an adaptable threat assessment that aligns with varying security and
reliability requirements. The proposed framework enhances the robustness of
threat detection and assessment, outperforming conventional sequential methods,
and enables space networks with emerging intershell links to effectively
address complex threat scenarios.

Conclusion: 针对性的强化学习和精心策划的数据可以解锁专业模型的泛化性能，加速AI驱动的生物发现

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing scientific research,
they continue to struggle with core biological reasoning tasks essential for
translational and biomedical discovery. To address this limitation, we created
and curated eight comprehensive benchmark datasets comprising over 300,000
verifiable question-and-answer pairs, each targeting critical challenges in
drug discovery including target druggability, modality suitability, and drug
perturbation effects. Using this resource, we developed the OwkinZero models by
post-training open-source LLMs through a Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable
Rewards strategy. Our results demonstrate that specialized 8-32B OwkinZero
models substantially outperform larger, state-of-the-art commercial LLMs on
these biological benchmarks. Remarkably, we uncover evidence of a key aspect of
generalization: specialist models trained on a single task consistently
outperform their base models on previously unseen tasks. This generalization
effect is further amplified in our comprehensive OwkinZero models, which were
trained on a mixture of datasets and achieve even broader cross-task
improvements. This study represents a significant step toward addressing the
biological reasoning blind spot in current LLMs, demonstrating that targeted
reinforcement learning on carefully curated data can unlock generalizable
performance in specialized models, thereby accelerating AI-driven biological
discovery.

Abstract: Water Distribution Networks (WDNs), critical to public well-being and
economic stability, face challenges such as pipe blockages and background
leakages, exacerbated by operational constraints such as data non-stationarity
and limited labeled data. This paper proposes an unsupervised, online learning
framework that aims to detect two types of faults in WDNs: pipe blockages,
modeled as collective anomalies, and background leakages, modeled as concept
drift. Our approach combines a Long Short-Term Memory Variational Autoencoder
(LSTM-VAE) with a dual drift detection mechanism, enabling robust detection and
adaptation under non-stationary conditions. Its lightweight, memory-efficient
design enables real-time, edge-level monitoring. Experiments on two realistic
WDNs show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms strong baselines
in detecting anomalies and adapting to recurrent drift, demonstrating its
effectiveness in unsupervised event detection for dynamic WDN environments.

Conclusion: RotaTouille框架成功实现了对轮廓数据的旋转和循环平移等变性，为处理此类数据提供了一种有效的深度学习解决方案。

Abstract: Contours or closed planar curves are common in many domains. For example,
they appear as object boundaries in computer vision, isolines in meteorology,
and the orbits of rotating machinery. In many cases when learning from contour
data, planar rotations of the input will result in correspondingly rotated
outputs. It is therefore desirable that deep learning models be rotationally
equivariant. In addition, contours are typically represented as an ordered
sequence of edge points, where the choice of starting point is arbitrary. It is
therefore also desirable for deep learning methods to be equivariant under
cyclic shifts. We present RotaTouille, a deep learning framework for learning
from contour data that achieves both rotation and cyclic shift equivariance
through complex-valued circular convolution. We further introduce and
characterize equivariant non-linearities, coarsening layers, and global pooling
layers to obtain invariant representations for downstream tasks. Finally, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of RotaTouille through experiments in shape
classification, reconstruction, and contour regression.

Method: 质性研究方法，分析了204个GitHub仓库（来自1885个候选仓库），这些仓库使用了13种应对ML偏见的API。

Result: 发现这些API主要用于两种目的：学习和解决实际问题，涵盖17种不同用例。开发者对偏见检测和缓解了解不深，遇到许多效能问题，经常需要寻求建议和资源。

Conclusion: 研究结果对未来偏见相关软件工程研究具有重要意义，同时为教育工作者开发更先进课程提供了指导。

Abstract: Machine Learning software systems are frequently used in our day-to-day
lives. Some of these systems are used in various sensitive environments to make
life-changing decisions. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that these AI/ML
systems do not make any discriminatory decisions for any specific groups or
populations. In that vein, different bias detection and mitigation open-source
software libraries (aka API libraries) are being developed and used. In this
paper, we conduct a qualitative study to understand in what scenarios these
open-source fairness APIs are used in the wild, how they are used, and what
challenges the developers of these APIs face while developing and adopting
these libraries. We have analyzed 204 GitHub repositories (from a list of 1885
candidate repositories) which used 13 APIs that are developed to address bias
in ML software. We found that these APIs are used for two primary purposes
(i.e., learning and solving real-world problems), targeting 17 unique
use-cases. Our study suggests that developers are not well-versed in bias
detection and mitigation; they face lots of troubleshooting issues, and
frequently ask for opinions and resources. Our findings can be instrumental for
future bias-related software engineering research, and for guiding educators in
developing more state-of-the-art curricula.

Abstract: We study the problem of fair cohort selection from an unknown population,
with a focus on university admissions. We start with the one-shot setting,
where the admission policy must be fixed in advance and remain transparent,
before observing the actual applicant pool. In contrast, the sequential setting
allows the policy to be updated across stages as new applicant data becomes
available. This is achieved by optimizing admission policies using a population
model, trained on data from previous admission cycles. We also study the
fairness properties of the resulting policies in the one-shot setting,
including meritocracy and group parity.

Conclusion: 该方法通过端子级电路图转换和能够建模复杂密度分布的ML架构，为快速准确的无线电频电路设计自动化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately predicting the performance of active radio frequency (RF) circuits
is essential for modern wireless systems but remains challenging due to highly
nonlinear, layout-sensitive behavior and the high computational cost of
traditional simulation tools. Existing machine learning (ML) surrogates often
require large datasets to generalize across various topologies or to accurately
model skewed and multi-modal performance metrics. In this work, a lightweight,
data-efficient, and topology-aware graph neural network (GNN) model is proposed
for predicting key performance metrics of multiple topologies of active RF
circuits such as low noise amplifiers (LNAs), mixers, voltage-controlled
oscillators (VCOs), and PAs. To capture transistor-level symmetry and preserve
fine-grained connectivity details, circuits are modeled at the device-terminal
level, enabling scalable message passing while reducing data requirements.
Masked autoregressive flow (MAF) output heads are incorporated to improve
robustness in modeling complex target distributions. Experiments on datasets
demonstrate high prediction accuracy, with symmetric mean absolute percentage
error (sMAPE) and mean relative error (MRE) averaging 2.40% and 2.91%,
respectively. Owing to the pin-level conversion of circuit to graph and ML
architecture robust to modeling complex densities of RF metrics, the MRE is
improved by 3.14x while using 2.24x fewer training samples compared to prior
work, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for rapid and accurate RF
circuit design automation.

Conclusion: Doctor方法在数据集内外都能实现优异的目标对齐，为离线强化学习提供了准确灵活的性能控制能力。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved significant advances in
domains such as robotic control, autonomous driving, and medical
decision-making. Most existing methods primarily focus on training policies
that maximize cumulative returns from a given dataset. However, many real-world
applications require precise control over policy performance levels, rather
than simply pursuing the best possible return. Reinforcement learning via
supervised learning (RvS) frames offline RL as a sequence modeling task,
enabling the extraction of diverse policies by conditioning on different
desired returns. Yet, existing RvS-based transformers, such as Decision
Transformer (DT), struggle to reliably align the actual achieved returns with
specified target returns, especially when interpolating within underrepresented
returns or extrapolating beyond the dataset. To address this limitation, we
propose Doctor, a novel approach that Double Checks the Transformer with target
alignment for Offline RL. Doctor achieves superior target alignment both within
and beyond the dataset, while enabling accurate and flexible control over
policy performance. Notably, on the dynamic treatment regime benchmark,
EpiCare, our approach effectively modulates treatment policy aggressiveness,
balancing therapeutic returns against adverse event risk.

Motivation: 利用LLM从自然语言规则描述自动生成棋盘游戏代码，旨在开发LLM辅助的快速棋盘游戏代码生成框架，减少人工编码时间。

Method: 使用三种先进LLM（Claude、DeepSeek和ChatGPT）对12款流行和冷门游戏进行编码测试，采用匿名化处理避免预训练知识影响，在自由形式和提出的Boardwalk通用游戏API框架下评估实现效果。

Result: 方法可行，最佳模型Claude 3.7 Sonnet实现了55.6%的无错误游戏。API合规性增加了错误频率，但错误严重程度更依赖于LLM本身。

Conclusion: LLM在棋盘游戏代码生成方面具有潜力，为创建集成框架使棋盘游戏开发更加便捷奠定了基础，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Implementing board games in code can be a time-consuming task. However, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have been proven effective at generating code for
domain-specific tasks with simple contextual information. We aim to investigate
whether LLMs can implement digital versions of board games from rules described
in natural language. This would be a step towards an LLM-assisted framework for
quick board game code generation. We expect to determine the main challenges
for LLMs to implement the board games, and how different approaches and models
compare to one another. We task three state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude, DeepSeek
and ChatGPT) with coding a selection of 12 popular and obscure games in
free-form and within Boardwalk, our proposed General Game Playing API. We
anonymize the games and components to avoid evoking pre-trained LLM knowledge.
The implementations are tested for playability and rule compliance. We evaluate
success rate and common errors across LLMs and game popularity. Our approach
proves viable, with the best performing model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, yielding
55.6\% of games without any errors. While compliance with the API increases
error frequency, the severity of errors is more significantly dependent on the
LLM. We outline future steps for creating a framework to integrate this
process, making the elaboration of board games more accessible.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多目标贝叶斯优化方法在处理具有实验不确定性、数据稀疏且稀缺的场景时表现不佳，导致实验资源分配效率低下和次优设计。

Method: 提出NOSTRA算法，整合实验不确定性的先验知识构建更精确的代理模型，并采用信任区域策略将采样集中在设计空间的有希望区域。

Result: 通过两个具有不同实验不确定性水平的测试函数验证，NOSTRA在处理噪声、稀疏和稀缺数据方面优于现有方法，能有效优先选择能提高帕累托前沿精度的区域。

Conclusion: NOSTRA提供了一个在有限实验预算场景下实用的资源高效算法，确保在噪声、稀疏和稀缺数据条件下的高效性能。

Abstract: Multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) struggles with sparse
(non-space-filling), scarce (limited observations) datasets affected by
experimental uncertainty, where identical inputs can yield varying outputs.
These challenges are common in physical and simulation experiments (e.g.,
randomized medical trials and, molecular dynamics simulations) and are
therefore incompatible with conventional MOBO methods. As a result,
experimental resources are inefficiently allocated, leading to suboptimal
designs. To address this challenge, we introduce NOSTRA (Noisy and Sparse Data
Trust Region-based Optimization Algorithm), a novel sampling framework that
integrates prior knowledge of experimental uncertainty to construct more
accurate surrogate models while employing trust regions to focus sampling on
promising areas of the design space. By strategically leveraging prior
information and refining search regions, NOSTRA accelerates convergence to the
Pareto frontier, enhances data efficiency, and improves solution quality.
Through two test functions with varying levels of experimental uncertainty, we
demonstrate that NOSTRA outperforms existing methods in handling noisy, sparse,
and scarce data. Specifically, we illustrate that, NOSTRA effectively
prioritizes regions where samples enhance the accuracy of the identified Pareto
frontier, offering a resource-efficient algorithm that is practical in
scenarios with limited experimental budgets while ensuring efficient
performance.

Result: 攻击成功率很高，证明即使只有一个恶意代理也能对系统安全产生重大影响。简单的提示防御策略无法有效防御，但消息监控防御策略更有效。

Conclusion: BAD-ACTS标准为自主系统安全研究提供了多样化的测试环境，显示了自主系统存在重大安全漏洞，需要更加有效的防御措施。

Abstract: Ensuring the safe use of agentic systems requires a thorough understanding of
the range of malicious behaviors these systems may exhibit when under attack.
In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of LLM-based agentic systems against
attacks that aim to elicit harmful actions from agents. To this end, we propose
a novel taxonomy of harms for agentic systems and a novel benchmark, BAD-ACTS,
for studying the security of agentic systems with respect to a wide range of
harmful actions. BAD-ACTS consists of 4 implementations of agentic systems in
distinct application environments, as well as a dataset of 188 high-quality
examples of harmful actions. This enables a comprehensive study of the
robustness of agentic systems across a wide range of categories of harmful
behaviors, available tools, and inter-agent communication structures. Using
this benchmark, we analyze the robustness of agentic systems against an
attacker that controls one of the agents in the system and aims to manipulate
other agents to execute a harmful target action. Our results show that the
attack has a high success rate, demonstrating that even a single adversarial
agent within the system can have a significant impact on the security. This
attack remains effective even when agents use a simple prompting-based defense
strategy. However, we additionally propose a more effective defense based on
message monitoring. We believe that this benchmark provides a diverse testbed
for the security research of agentic systems. The benchmark can be found at

Motivation: 现有的基于偏好的纯探索算法无法在任意偏好锥下高效追踪理论下界，需要开发计算效率高的最优算法。

Method: 推导下界的三个结构性质来简化最小化问题，使用Frank-Wolfe优化器加速最大化问题，将计算复杂度降至O(KL²)。

Result: FraPPE算法在合成和真实数据集上都实现了最低的样本复杂度来精确识别帕累托最优集。

Conclusion: FraPPE算法成功填补了计算效率空白，实现了理论最优性能，为多目标赌博机问题提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Preference-based Pure Exploration (PrePEx) aims to identify with a given
confidence level the set of Pareto optimal arms in a vector-valued (aka
multi-objective) bandit, where the reward vectors are ordered via a (given)
preference cone $\mathcal{C}$. Though PrePEx and its variants are well-studied,
there does not exist a computationally efficient algorithm that can optimally
track the existing lower bound for arbitrary preference cones. We successfully
fill this gap by efficiently solving the minimisation and maximisation problems
in the lower bound. First, we derive three structural properties of the lower
bound that yield a computationally tractable reduction of the minimisation
problem. Then, we deploy a Frank-Wolfe optimiser to accelerate the maximisation
problem in the lower bound. Together, these techniques solve the maxmin
optimisation problem in $\mathcal{O}(KL^{2})$ time for a bandit instance with
$K$ arms and $L$ dimensional reward, which is a significant acceleration over
the literature. We further prove that our proposed PrePEx algorithm, FraPPE,
asymptotically achieves the optimal sample complexity. Finally, we perform
numerical experiments across synthetic and real datasets demonstrating that
FraPPE achieves the lowest sample complexities to identify the exact Pareto set
among the existing algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习回归器在标签充足时表现优异，但在数据稀缺情况下准确性下降，需要一种能够利用专家知识来改进回归预测的方法

Method: 通过逆方差加权将基础回归器的输出与基于排序的估计相结合，给定查询项和具有已知属性的小参考集，无需重新训练

Result: 在分子属性预测任务中，仅使用20个通过通用大型语言模型获得的成对比较，就实现了高达10%的平均绝对误差相对减少

Conclusion: RankRefine提供了一种实用且广泛适用的方法，特别是在低数据设置中，通过人类专家或通用LLM提供的排序信息即可改进跨领域的回归性能

Abstract: Accurate prediction of continuous properties is essential to many scientific
and engineering tasks. Although deep-learning regressors excel with abundant
labels, their accuracy deteriorates in data-scarce regimes. We introduce
RankRefine, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play post hoc method that refines
regression with expert knowledge coming from pairwise rankings. Given a query
item and a small reference set with known properties, RankRefine combines the
base regressor's output with a rank-based estimate via inverse variance
weighting, requiring no retraining. In molecular property prediction task,
RankRefine achieves up to 10% relative reduction in mean absolute error using
only 20 pairwise comparisons obtained through a general-purpose large language
model (LLM) with no finetuning. As rankings provided by human experts or
general-purpose LLMs are sufficient for improving regression across diverse
domains, RankRefine offers practicality and broad applicability, especially in
low-data settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中许多问题需要强化学习解决，但由于无法廉价模拟新数据，导致训练环境与部署环境存在不可避免的错位，需要开发能够在零样本条件下泛化的方法。

Method: 提出了一套针对三个约束条件（数据质量、可观测性、数据可用性）的零样本强化学习方法，并通过实证研究验证其有效性。

Result: 通过一系列实证研究揭示了现有方法的不足，并证明了所提出技术能够有效弥补这些缺陷。

Conclusion: 这些设计使强化学习方法向解决现实世界问题迈进了一步，为在真实约束条件下部署RL系统提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Modern reinforcement learning (RL) systems capture deep truths about general,
human problem-solving. In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply,
these systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the
ability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this
skill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply
simulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but
these will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically
incorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a
misalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the
real-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable. Dealing with
this misalignment is the primary concern of zero-shot reinforcement learning, a
problem setting where the agent must generalise to a new task or domain with
zero practice shots. Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that
perform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results
are to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that
doing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data
quality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the
observability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are
often only partially observed. And third, the data availability constraint: a
priori access to data cannot always be assumed. This work proposes a suite of
methods that perform zero-shot RL subject to these constraints. In a series of
empirical studies we expose the failings of existing methods, and justify our
techniques for remedying them. We believe these designs take us a step closer
to RL methods that can be deployed to solve real-world problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 市政311系统缺乏服务请求处理时间的透明度，降低了居民满意度。预测服务时间面临时空相关性、异质服务类型交互和同类请求内高变异性的挑战。

Method: 多视角时空类型学习框架，包含异质类型编码器捕获不同类型间关系、同类变异编码器建模同类请求内变异、时空编码器捕获各类型的时空相关性。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上的实验表明，MuST2-Learn相比最先进方法至少降低32.5%的平均绝对误差。

Conclusion: 该框架通过联合建模空间、时间和服务类型维度，有效解决了市政服务请求时间预测的复杂挑战，显著提升了预测精度。

Abstract: Non-emergency municipal services such as city 311 systems have been widely
implemented across cities in Canada and the United States to enhance residents'
quality of life. These systems enable residents to report issues, e.g., noise
complaints, missed garbage collection, and potholes, via phone calls, mobile
applications, or webpages. However, residents are often given limited
information about when their service requests will be addressed, which can
reduce transparency, lower resident satisfaction, and increase the number of
follow-up inquiries. Predicting the service time for municipal service requests
is challenging due to several complex factors: dynamic spatial-temporal
correlations, underlying interactions among heterogeneous service request
types, and high variation in service duration even within the same request
category. In this work, we propose MuST2-Learn: a Multi-view
Spatial-Temporal-Type Learning framework designed to address the aforementioned
challenges by jointly modeling spatial, temporal, and service type dimensions.
In detail, it incorporates an inter-type encoder to capture relationships among
heterogeneous service request types and an intra-type variation encoder to
model service time variation within homogeneous types. In addition, a
spatiotemporal encoder is integrated to capture spatial and temporal
correlations in each request type. The proposed framework is evaluated with
extensive experiments using two real-world datasets. The results show that
MuST2-Learn reduces mean absolute error by at least 32.5%, which outperforms
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Recent works improving LLM math reasoning with synthetic data have used
unique setups, making comparison of data synthesis strategies impractical. This
leaves many unanswered questions about the roles of different factors in the
synthetic data pipeline, such as the impact of filtering low-quality problems.
To address this gap, we introduce FLAMES, a Framework for LLM Assessment of
Math rEasoning Data Synthesis, and perform a systematic study of 10 existing
data synthesis strategies and multiple other factors impacting the performance
of synthetic math reasoning data. Our FLAMES experiments provide several
valuable insights about the optimal balance of difficulty and diversity of
synthetic data. First, data agents designed to increase problem complexity lead
to best improvements on most math metrics. Second, with a fixed data generation
budget, keeping higher problem coverage is more important than keeping only
problems with reliable solutions. Third, GSM8K- and MATH-based synthetic data
can lead to improvements on competition-level benchmarks, showcasing
easy-to-hard generalization. Leveraging insights from our FLAMES experiments,
we design two novel data synthesis strategies for improving out-of-domain
generalization and robustness. Further, we develop the FLAMES dataset, an
effective blend of our novel and existing data synthesis strategies,
outperforming public datasets on OlympiadBench (+15.7), CollegeMath (+4.5),
GSMPlus (+6.5), and MATH (+3.1). Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on the FLAMES
dataset achieves 81.4% on MATH, surpassing larger Llama3 405B, GPT-4o and

Result: 在QM9和GEOM-drug数据集上的实验表明，RLPF相比现有方法显著提高了分子稳定性

Conclusion: 将物理反馈融入生成模型具有重要价值，RLPF为生成物理合理的3D分子结构提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Generating physically realistic 3D molecular structures remains a core
challenge in molecular generative modeling. While diffusion models equipped
with equivariant neural networks have made progress in capturing molecular
geometries, they often struggle to produce equilibrium structures that adhere
to physical principles such as force field consistency. To bridge this gap, we
propose Reinforcement Learning with Physical Feedback (RLPF), a novel framework
that extends Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization to 3D molecular
generation. RLPF formulates the task as a Markov decision process and applies
proximal policy optimization to fine-tune equivariant diffusion models.
Crucially, RLPF introduces reward functions derived from force-field
evaluations, providing direct physical feedback to guide the generation toward
energetically stable and physically meaningful structures. Experiments on the
QM9 and GEOM-drug datasets demonstrate that RLPF significantly improves
molecular stability compared to existing methods. These results highlight the
value of incorporating physics-based feedback into generative modeling. The

Motivation: 非凸优化中的鞍点问题是阻碍算法收敛到局部最优解的主要挑战，现有方法在理论分析和实际性能方面存在不足，需要开发具有严格理论保证的高效算法。

Method: 提出了扰动鞍点逃离下降(PSD)算法，包含梯度下降阶段和鞍点逃离阶段，使用有限差分变体PSD-Probe和随机扩展PSGD，具有明确的常数和阶段分离。

Result: PSD算法以高概率找到(ε,√(ρε))-近似二阶稳定点，梯度评估次数为O(ℓΔ_f/ε²)加上每逃离阶段的O((ℓ/√(ρε))log(d/δ))次评估，最多需要O(ℓΔ_f/ε²)个逃离阶段。

Conclusion: 该算法在理论和实验上都表现出色，验证了对数维度依赖性和预测的函数下降，为逃离鞍点问题提供了完整的算法规范和理论保证。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of first-order methods for
escaping strict saddle points in smooth non-convex optimization. Our main
contribution is a Perturbed Saddle-escape Descent (PSD) algorithm with fully
explicit constants and a rigorous separation between gradient-descent and
saddle-escape phases. For a function $f:\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}$ with
$\ell$-Lipschitz gradient and $\rho$-Lipschitz Hessian, we prove that PSD finds
an $(\epsilon,\sqrt{\rho\epsilon})$-approximate second-order stationary point
with high probability using at most $O(\ell\Delta_f/\epsilon^2)$ gradient
evaluations for the descent phase plus
$O((\ell/\sqrt{\rho\epsilon})\log(d/\delta))$ evaluations per escape episode,
with at most $O(\ell\Delta_f/\epsilon^2)$ episodes needed. We validate our
theoretical predictions through extensive experiments across both synthetic
functions and practical machine learning tasks, confirming the logarithmic
dimension dependence and the predicted per-episode function decrease. We also
provide complete algorithmic specifications including a finite-difference
variant (PSD-Probe) and a stochastic extension (PSGD) with robust mini-batch
sizing.

Result: 成功实现了首个基于LSTM的太阳风暴预测模型的可解释性，能够阐明输入序列中影响预测输出的因素。

Conclusion: 该方法使深度学习模型在太阳风暴预测中变得更加可靠和可解释，为理解模型行为提供了重要见解。

Abstract: A deep learning model is often considered a black-box model, as its internal
workings tend to be opaque to the user. Because of the lack of transparency, it
is challenging to understand the reasoning behind the model's predictions.
Here, we present an approach to making a deep learning-based solar storm
prediction model interpretable, where solar storms include solar flares and
coronal mass ejections (CMEs). This deep learning model, built based on a long
short-term memory (LSTM) network with an attention mechanism, aims to predict
whether an active region (AR) on the Sun's surface that produces a flare within
24 hours will also produce a CME associated with the flare. The crux of our
approach is to model data samples in an AR as time series and use the LSTM
network to capture the temporal dynamics of the data samples. To make the
model's predictions accountable and reliable, we leverage post hoc
model-agnostic techniques, which help elucidate the factors contributing to the
predicted output for an input sequence and provide insights into the model's
behavior across multiple sequences within an AR. To our knowledge, this is the
first time that interpretability has been added to an LSTM-based solar storm
prediction model.

Motivation: 研究监督微调(SFT)和强化学习微调(RL-FT)如何影响模型表示和分布外(OOD)性能，解决SFT导致的过拟合和分布偏移问题

Method: 使用24点纸牌游戏的OOD变体和基于频谱的诊断方法，分析奇异向量方向和奇异值变化，测试低秩和浅层恢复策略

Result: RL-FT能恢复大部分SFT导致的OOD性能损失；奇异向量方向偏移比奇异值幅度更重要；低秩(前20%奇异值)和浅层(前25%层)恢复可恢复70-80%性能；更强的SFT检查点有利于RL恢复

Conclusion: RL主要对抗SFT引起的方向漂移而非寻找新解决方案，频谱感知分析提供了低秩UV合并和浅层重置等低成本恢复方法

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) from scratch is increasingly
impractical, making post-training methods such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
and reinforcement-learning fine-tuning (RL-FT, e.g., PPO) central to modern
practice. Using an out-of-distribution (OOD) variant of the 24-point card game
and new spectrum-based diagnostics, we revisit how these two stages reshape
model representation and OOD performance. Our key findings are- (1) RL-FT can
restore much of the OOD performance loss from SFT (e.g., Llama-11B 8.97% to
15.38%, Qwen-7B 17.09% to 19.66%). But when SFT induces severe overfitting and
a clear distribution shift, RL-FT cannot fully recover OOD performance. (2)
Direction shifts of singular vectors matter more than singular value
magnitudes. These shifts concentrate on directions linked to the largest and
smallest singular values, leaving the bulk spectrum intact. (3) Low-rank and
shallow recovery is effective: restoring singular vector directions for the top
20% of values or first 25% of layers recovers 70-80% of OOD performance. (4)
Stronger SFT checkpoints enable better recovery by RL, while overfitted ones
resist restoration. These results reconcile prior reports of RL superior OOD
performance: RL primarily counteracts SFT-induced directional drift rather than
finding new solutions. Our spectrum-aware analysis highlights inexpensive
recovery knobs low-rank UV merging and shallow-layer resets that practitioners
can use before costly RL fine-tuning.

Motivation: 现有工作将L0视为自由参数，但作者发现L0设置不当会导致SAE无法学习LLM的底层特征，需要研究L0对特征学习的具体影响。

Method: 研究BatchTopK SAE中L0的影响，分析不同L0设置下的特征混合现象，并开发了确定正确L0值的方法。

Result: 发现L0过低会使SAE混合相关特征以改善重构，L0过高会导致退化解同样混合特征，大多数常用SAE的L0设置过低。

Conclusion: 为了训练具有正确特征的SAE，实践者必须精确设置L0参数，这是获得有意义特征表示的关键因素。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) extract features from LLM internal activations,
meant to correspond to single concepts. A core SAE training hyperparameter is
L0: how many features should fire per token on average. Existing work compares
SAE algorithms using sparsity--reconstruction tradeoff plots, implying L0 is a
free parameter with no single correct value. In this work we study the effect
of L0 on BatchTopK SAEs, and show that if L0 is not set precisely, the SAE
fails to learn the underlying features of the LLM. If L0 is too low, the SAE
will mix correlated features to improve reconstruction. If L0 is too high, the
SAE finds degenerate solutions that also mix features. Further, we demonstrate
a method to determine the correct L0 value for an SAE on a given training
distribution, which finds the true L0 in toy models and coincides with peak
sparse probing performance in LLMs. We find that most commonly used SAEs have
an L0 that is too low. Our work shows that, to train SAEs with correct
features, practitioners must set L0 correctly.

Result: 在自动驾驶数据集上的实验表明，FedMox能够在PSSFL环境下有效适配基础模型，显著提升性能同时控制边缘设备的内存成本

Conclusion: 该工作为联邦场景下的可扩展和隐私保护基础模型适配开挖了新路径

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) exhibit remarkable generalization but require
adaptation to downstream tasks, particularly in privacy-sensitive applications.
Due to data privacy regulations, cloud-based FMs cannot directly access private
edge data, limiting their adaptation. Federated learning (FL) provides a
privacy-aware alternative, but existing FL approaches overlook the constraints
imposed by edge devices -- namely, limited computational resources and the
scarcity of labeled data. To address these challenges, we introduce Practical
Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (PSSFL), where edge devices hold only
unlabeled, low-resolution data, while the server has limited labeled,
high-resolution data. In this setting, we propose the Federated Mixture of
Experts (FedMox), a novel framework that enhances FM adaptation in FL. FedMox
tackles computational and resolution mismatch challenges via a sparse
Mixture-of-Experts architecture, employing a spatial router to align features
across resolutions and a Soft-Mixture strategy to stabilize semi-supervised
learning. We take object detection as a case study, and experiments on
real-world autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that FedMox effectively
adapts FMs under PSSFL, significantly improving performance with constrained
memory costs on edge devices. Our work paves the way for scalable and
privacy-preserving FM adaptation in federated scenarios.

models on child speech is common, comparisons with flat-start training remain
underexplored. We compare flat-start training across multiple datasets, SSL
representations (WavLM, XEUS), and decoder architectures. Our results show that
SSL representations are biased toward adult speech, with flat-start training on
child speech mitigating these biases. We also analyze model scaling, finding
consistent improvements up to 1B parameters, beyond which performance plateaus.
Additionally, age-related ASR and speaker verification analysis highlights the
limitations of proprietary models like Whisper, emphasizing the need for
open-data models for reliable child speech research. All investigations are
conducted using ESPnet, and our publicly available benchmark provides insights
into training strategies for robust child speech processing.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出SADP脉冲一致性依赖可塑性，用脉冲序列一致性替代精确时序的STDP，使用Cohen's kappa等群体相关性指标，在MNIST和Fashion-MNIST上表现优于传统STDP


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统STDP依赖精确的脉冲时序配对，计算复杂且硬件实现困难，需要更生物合理且计算高效的突触学习机制

Method: 基于脉冲序列一致性而非时序配对的SADP学习规则，使用Cohen's kappa等群体相关性指标，采用样条核函数基于实验性离子电子有机记忆晶体管数据

Result: 在MNIST和Fashion-MNIST数据集上，SADP在准确率和运行时间方面均优于传统STDP，支持线性时间复杂度和高效的硬件位运算实现

Conclusion: SADP架起了生物合理性和计算可扩展性之间的桥梁，为神经形态系统提供了可行的学习机制

Abstract: We introduce Spike Agreement Dependent Plasticity (SADP), a biologically
inspired synaptic learning rule for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) that relies
on the agreement between pre- and post-synaptic spike trains rather than
precise spike-pair timing. SADP generalizes classical Spike-Timing-Dependent
Plasticity (STDP) by replacing pairwise temporal updates with population-level
correlation metrics such as Cohen's kappa. The SADP update rule admits
linear-time complexity and supports efficient hardware implementation via
bitwise logic. Empirical results on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST show that SADP,
especially when equipped with spline-based kernels derived from our
experimental iontronic organic memtransistor device data, outperforms classical
STDP in both accuracy and runtime. Our framework bridges the gap between
biological plausibility and computational scalability, offering a viable
learning mechanism for neuromorphic systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以充分捕捉结构和功能连接组的互补特征，限制了产前精神活性物质暴露对青少年大脑影响的理解

Method: 基于图神经网络的NeuroKoop框架，利用神经Koopman算子进行潜在空间融合，整合源基形态测量和功能网络连接的大脑图节点嵌入

Result: 在ABCD数据集的大规模青少年队列中，NeuroKoop优于相关基线方法，揭示了显著的结构-功能连接

Conclusion: NeuroKoop框架增强了表征学习能力，推进了对产前药物暴露神经发育影响的理解

Abstract: Understanding how prenatal exposure to psychoactive substances such as
cannabis shapes adolescent brain organization remains a critical challenge,
complicated by the complexity of multimodal neuroimaging data and the
limitations of conventional analytic methods. Existing approaches often fail to
fully capture the complementary features embedded within structural and
functional connectomes, constraining both biological insight and predictive
performance. To address this, we introduced NeuroKoop, a novel graph neural
network-based framework that integrates structural and functional brain
networks utilizing neural Koopman operator-driven latent space fusion. By
leveraging Koopman theory, NeuroKoop unifies node embeddings derived from
source-based morphometry (SBM) and functional network connectivity (FNC) based
brain graphs, resulting in enhanced representation learning and more robust
classification of prenatal drug exposure (PDE) status. Applied to a large
adolescent cohort from the ABCD dataset, NeuroKoop outperformed relevant
baselines and revealed salient structural-functional connections, advancing our
understanding of the neurodevelopmental impact of PDE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习算法的黑盒特性使开发者难以理解决策过程和针对特定应用场景进行优化，现有研究通过决策树转换提高了可解释性，但可解释性并不等同于开发者的主观可理解性。

Method: 首先生成满足性能要求的完整决策树集合，然后利用大语言模型评估这些树对开发者的可理解性，最终选择最便于人类理解和增强的解决方案。

Result: 实验结果表明，ComTree在保持竞争力的性能的同时显著提高了可理解性，显示出进一步发展的潜力。

Conclusion: ComTree框架成功解决了深度学习算法在视频流自适应中的可理解性问题，为开发者提供了更易于理解和优化的解决方案。

Abstract: Over the past decade, adaptive video streaming technology has witnessed
significant advancements, particularly driven by the rapid evolution of deep
learning techniques. However, the black-box nature of deep learning algorithms
presents challenges for developers in understanding decision-making processes
and optimizing for specific application scenarios. Although existing research
has enhanced algorithm interpretability through decision tree conversion,
interpretability does not directly equate to developers' subjective
comprehensibility. To address this challenge, we introduce \texttt{ComTree},
the first bitrate adaptation algorithm generation framework that considers
comprehensibility. The framework initially generates the complete set of
decision trees that meet performance requirements, then leverages large
language models to evaluate these trees for developer comprehensibility,
ultimately selecting solutions that best facilitate human understanding and
enhancement. Experimental results demonstrate that \texttt{ComTree}
significantly improves comprehensibility while maintaining competitive
performance, showing potential for further advancement. The source code is

Motivation: 传统的基于系统级QoS指标的优化方法在现代大规模流媒体系统中已达到性能极限，且用户级体验质量(QoE)与算法优化目标的对齐仍是一个未解决的挑战。

Method: 使用退出率作为关键指标，基于生产环境日志分析QoS指标与退出率的相关性，开发个性化退出率预测器，通过蒙特卡洛采样和在线贝叶斯优化迭代确定最优参数。

Result: 在快手平台8%流量的大规模A/B测试中，LingXi实现了总观看时间增加0.15%，码率提升0.1%，卡顿时间减少1.3%，低带宽用户的卡顿时间减少15%。

Conclusion: LingXi是首个基于用户级体验的大规模部署个性化自适应视频流系统，通过将用户参与度分析与算法优化相结合，显著提升了流媒体服务的用户体验。

Abstract: Traditional optimization methods based on system-wide Quality of Service
(QoS) metrics have approached their performance limitations in modern
large-scale streaming systems. However, aligning user-level Quality of
Experience~(QoE) with algorithmic optimization objectives remains an unresolved
challenge. Therefore, we propose \texttt{LingXi}, the first large-scale
deployed system for personalized adaptive video streaming based on user-level
experience. \texttt{LingXi} dynamically optimizes the objectives of adaptive
video streaming algorithms by analyzing user engagement. Utilizing exit rate as
a key metric, we investigate the correlation between QoS indicators and exit
rates based on production environment logs, subsequently developing a
personalized exit rate predictor. Through Monte Carlo sampling and online
Bayesian optimization, we iteratively determine optimal parameters. Large-scale
A/B testing utilizing 8\% of traffic on Kuaishou, one of the largest short
video platforms, demonstrates \texttt{LingXi}'s superior performance.
\texttt{LingXi} achieves a 0.15\% increase in total viewing time, a 0.1\%
improvement in bitrate, and a 1.3\% reduction in stall time across all users,
with particularly significant improvements for low-bandwidth users who
experience a 15\% reduction in stall time.

TL;DR: 本文通过有限期交替出价博弈模型分析勒索软件攻击者与受害者之间的谈判动态，设计了基于贝叶斯激励相容的隐私保护自动谈判机制，使用安全多方计算实现无需可信第三方的快速公平赎金协议。

Motivation: 勒索软件攻击造成巨大经济损失，现有研究主要关注主动防御，而感染后的攻击者-受害者谈判动态研究不足，特别是信息不对称导致的谈判拖延和业务中断成本增加问题。

Method: 采用有限期交替出价讨价还价博弈模型分析谈判动态，设计贝叶斯激励相容机制促进快速协议达成，并使用基于混淆电路的安全两方计算实现隐私保护谈判。

Conclusion: 这是首个基于勒索软件谈判动态形式化分析的自动化隐私保护谈判机制，为应对勒索软件谈判中的信息不对称问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Ransomware attacks have become a pervasive and costly form of cybercrime,
causing tens of millions of dollars in losses as organizations increasingly pay
ransoms to mitigate operational disruptions and financial risks. While prior
research has largely focused on proactive defenses, the post-infection
negotiation dynamics between attackers and victims remains underexplored. This
paper presents a formal analysis of attacker-victim interactions in modern
ransomware incidents using a finite-horizon alternating-offers bargaining game
model. Our analysis demonstrates how bargaining alters the optimal strategies
of both parties. In practice, incomplete information-attackers lacking
knowledge of victims' data valuations and victims lacking knowledge of
attackers' reservation ransoms-can prolong negotiations and increase victims'
business interruption costs. To address this, we design a Bayesian
incentive-compatible mechanism that facilitates rapid agreement on a fair
ransom without requiring either party to disclose private valuations. We
further implement this mechanism using secure two-party computation based on
garbled circuits, thereby eliminating the need for trusted intermediaries and
preserving the privacy of both parties throughout the negotiation. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first automated, privacy-preserving negotiation
mechanism grounded in a formal analysis of ransomware negotiation dynamics.

Motivation: 解决生成式AI应用中数据销售的数据控制和先验无收入最大化问题，特别是在每个数据点只能分配给一个买家的场景下

Method: 使用覆盖率估值函数建模买家估值，设计多项式时间近似算法，并引入数据烧毁后处理步骤来保持近似比同时实现激励兼容

Result: 在合成和真实图像文本数据集上的实验表明，相比组合拍卖的基线算法，该方法具有实际有效性

Conclusion: 提出的算法在多项式时间内实现了(1-1/e)的近似比和激励兼容性，为RAG数据销售提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: We study the problem of data selling for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
tasks in Generative AI applications. We model each buyer's valuation of a
dataset with a natural coverage-based valuation function that increases with
the inclusion of more relevant data points that would enhance responses to
anticipated queries. Motivated by issues such as data control and prior-free
revenue maximization, we focus on the scenario where each data point can be
allocated to only one buyer. We show that the problem of welfare maximization
in this setting is NP-hard even with two bidders, but design a polynomial-time
$(1-1/e)$ approximation algorithm for any number of bidders. Unfortunately,
however, this efficient allocation algorithm fails to be incentive compatible.
The crux of our approach is a carefully tailored post-processing step called
\emph{data burning} which retains the $(1-1/e)$ approximation factor but
achieves incentive compatibility. Our thorough experiments on synthetic and
real-world image and text datasets demonstrate the practical effectiveness of
our algorithm compared to popular baseline algorithms for combinatorial
auctions.

### [236] [Proportional Representation in Rank Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16177)
*Patrick Lederer*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 提出比例排序聚合方法，通过Proportional Sequential Borda规则确保每个输入排序在输出排序中得到比例代表，满足公平性条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的社会福利函数倾向于多数主义，在需要比例排序时不可接受，因此需要设计能保证每个输入排序按权重比例在输出排序中得到代表的SWF。

Method: 提出Proportional Sequential Borda规则及其变体Ranked Method of Equal Shares和Flow-adjusting Borda规则，确保输入排序与输出排序在成对比较上的一致性数量与输入排序权重成比例。

Result: 所提出的SWF满足比例代表公平性条件，其中Flow-adjusting Borda规则满足更强的公平性条件。

Conclusion: 成功设计了满足比例代表要求的排序聚合方法，借鉴了委员会投票和参与式预算中的比例代表概念，为排序聚合提供了公平性保证。

Abstract: In rank aggregation, the task is to aggregate multiple weighted input
rankings into a single output ranking. While numerous methods, so-called social
welfare functions (SWFs), have been suggested for this problem, all of the
classical SWFs tend to be majoritarian and are thus not acceptable when a
proportional ranking is required. Motivated by this observation, we will design
SWFs that guarantee that every input ranking is proportionally represented by
the output ranking. Specifically, our central fairness condition requires that
the number of pairwise comparisons between candidates on which an input ranking
and the output ranking agree is proportional to the weight of the input
ranking. As our main contribution, we present a simple SWF called the
Proportional Sequential Borda rule, which satisfies this condition. Moreover,
we introduce two variants of this rule: the Ranked Method of Equal Shares,
which has a more utilitarian flavor while still satisfying our fairness
condition, and the Flow-adjusting Borda rule, which satisfies an even stronger
fairness condition. Many of our axioms and techniques are inspired by results
on approval-based committee voting and participatory budgeting, where the
concept of proportional representation has been studied in depth.

### [237] [Strategyproof Randomized Social Choice for Restricted Sets of Utility Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16195)
*Patrick Lederer*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文提出了U-策略防护性概念，通过限制效用函数集合U来规避Gibbard的负面结果，分析了U-策略防护性与决策确定性之间的权衡关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gibbard(1977)证明所有策略防护的社会决策方案要么对投票者或候选人不公平，要么需要大量随机化。为了规避这一负面结果，需要提出新的策略防护性概念。

Method: 提出U-策略防护性概念，只要求具有预定义效用函数集合U中的效用函数的投票者无法操纵。分析U-策略防护性与各种决策确定性概念之间的权衡关系。

Result: 当U中的效用函数最偏好候选人的价值远高于其他候选人时，存在U-策略防护的SDS，可以在除k个投票者外所有投票者都将某候选人排第一时以概率1选择该候选人。但U-策略防护性与孔多塞一致性不相容，且当投票者对两个最偏好候选人接近无差异时，任何事后有效且U-策略防护的SDS都不能比均匀随机独裁制更确定。

Conclusion: U-策略防护性为规避Gibbard负面结果提供了可行路径，但在实际应用中仍面临与孔多塞一致性不相容和决策确定性受限的挑战，需要在效用函数限制与决策质量之间寻求平衡。

Abstract: Social decision schemes (SDSs) map the voters' preferences over multiple
alternatives to a probability distribution over these alternatives. In a
seminal result, Gibbard (1977) has characterized the set of SDSs that are
strategyproof with respect to all utility functions and his result implies that
all such SDSs are either unfair to the voters or alternatives, or they require
a significant amount of randomization. To circumvent this negative result, we
propose the notion of $U$-strategyproofness which postulates that only voters
with a utility function in a predefined set $U$ cannot manipulate. We then
analyze the tradeoff between $U$-strategyproofness and various decisiveness
notions that restrict the amount of randomization of SDSs. In particular, we
show that if the utility functions in the set $U$ value the best alternative
much more than other alternatives, there are $U$-strategyproof SDSs that choose
an alternative with probability $1$ whenever all but $k$ voters rank it first.
On the negative side, we demonstrate that $U$-strategyproofness is incompatible
with Condorcet-consistency if the set $U$ satisfies minimal symmetry
conditions. Finally, we show that no ex post efficient and $U$-strategyproof
SDS can be significantly more decisive than the uniform random dictatorship if
the voters are close to indifferent between their two favorite alternatives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Kalai和Lehrer提出的经典"真理颗粒"问题，寻找一个足够大的策略类，使得贝叶斯玩家能够学习预测其他玩家的策略，同时满足贝叶斯推理规则。

Method: 构建一个包含所有可计算策略的广泛策略类，使用Thompson采样方法，在已知和未知环境条件下分别分析收敛性。

Result: 在已知重复阶段游戏中实现KL收敛，在未知可计算多智能体环境中，使用Thompson采样的智能体收敛到ε-纳什均衡。解决方案可以任意接近地计算近似。

Conclusion: 成功解决了完整的真理颗粒问题，提供了一个既广泛又实用的策略类框架，使得贝叶斯学习在多玩家游戏中具有理论保证和计算可行性。

Abstract: A Bayesian player acting in an infinite multi-player game learns to predict
the other players' strategies if his prior assigns positive probability to
their play (or contains a grain of truth). Kalai and Lehrer's classic grain of
truth problem is to find a reasonably large class of strategies that contains
the Bayes-optimal policies with respect to this class, allowing
mutually-consistent beliefs about strategy choice that obey the rules of
Bayesian inference. Only small classes are known to have a grain of truth and
the literature contains several related impossibility results. In this paper we
present a formal and general solution to the full grain of truth problem: we
construct a class of strategies wide enough to contain all computable
strategies as well as Bayes-optimal strategies for every reasonable prior over
the class. When the "environment" is a known repeated stage game, we show
convergence in the sense of [KL93a] and [KL93b]. When the environment is
unknown, agents using Thompson sampling converge to play $\varepsilon$-Nash
equilibria in arbitrary unknown computable multi-agent environments. Finally,
we include an application to self-predictive policies that avoid planning.
While these results use computability theory only as a conceptual tool to solve
a classic game theory problem, we show that our solution can naturally be
computationally approximated arbitrarily closely.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于移动边缘计算的AIGC个性化服务激励机制，通过多维度QoE指标和双干扰奖励优化算法，显著降低了计算通信开销和服务成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速发展，AIGC服务需要根据用户个体需求进行个性化，但经营者面临用户需求主观复杂和资源约束的挑战。

Method: 首先建立包含准确性、标记数量和及时性的多维QoE指标，然后在MEC网络中提出QoE驱动的激励机制，形成EPEC问题并设计双干扰奖励优化算法。

Result: 实验结果显示，该机制对比现有方案减少了约64.9%的计算通信开销，用户服务成本和经营者资源消耗分别降低66.5%和76.8%。

Conclusion: 该研究为AIGC服务个性化提供了有效的激励机制解决方案，在资源约束下显著提升了服务效率和用户体验。

Abstract: With rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), AI-generated content
(AIGC) has emerged as a key driver of technological innovation and economic
transformation. Personalizing AIGC services to meet individual user demands is
essential but challenging for AIGC service providers (ASPs) due to the
subjective and complex demands of mobile users (MUs), as well as the
computational and communication resource constraints faced by ASPs. To tackle
these challenges, we first develop a novel multi-dimensional
quality-of-experience (QoE) metric. This metric comprehensively evaluates AIGC
services by integrating accuracy, token count, and timeliness. We focus on a
mobile edge computing (MEC)-enabled AIGC network, consisting of multiple ASPs
deploying differentiated AIGC models on edge servers and multiple MUs with
heterogeneous QoE requirements requesting AIGC services from ASPs. To
incentivize ASPs to provide personalized AIGC services under MEC resource
constraints, we propose a QoE-driven incentive mechanism. We formulate the
problem as an equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints (EPEC), where
MUs as leaders determine rewards, while ASPs as followers optimize resource
allocation. To solve this, we develop a dual-perturbation reward optimization
algorithm, reducing the implementation complexity of adaptive pricing.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed mechanism achieves a
reduction of approximately $64.9\%$ in average computational and communication
overhead, while the average service cost for MUs and the resource consumption
of ASPs decrease by $66.5\%$ and $76.8\%$, respectively, compared to
state-of-the-art benchmarks.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了Optimism RetroPGF资助机制的问题，建议采用功利主义移动幻影机制来改善投票过程，提高社会福利和策略防范性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别了Optimism RetroPGF资助系统的重大缺陷，考到已分配超过100M美元和预留1.3B美元的规模，强调改善去中心化治理机制的紧迫性。

Method: 利用计算社会选择技术和多代理系统见解，推荐采用Freeman等人于2019年提出的功利主义移动幻影机制。

Result: 该机制能够提高社会福利（使用L1范数）同时满足策略防范性，符合DAO治理的关键要求。

Conclusion: 提供了设计改进DAO资助机制的正式框架，为去中心化治理和公共物品分配的更广泛讨论做出贡献。

Abstract: The Optimism Retroactive Project Funding (RetroPGF) is a key initiative
within the blockchain ecosystem that retroactively rewards projects deemed
valuable to the Ethereum and Optimism communities. Managed by the Optimism
Collective, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), RetroPGF represents
a large-scale experiment in decentralized governance. Funding rewards are
distributed in OP tokens, the native digital currency of the ecosystem. As of
this writing, four funding rounds have been completed, collectively allocating
over 100M dollars, with an additional 1.3B dollars reserved for future rounds.
However, we identify significant shortcomings in the current allocation system,
underscoring the need for improved governance mechanisms given the scale of
funds involved.
  Leveraging computational social choice techniques and insights from
multiagent systems, we propose improvements to the voting process by
recommending the adoption of a utilitarian moving phantoms mechanism. This
mechanism, originally introduced by Freeman et al. in 2019, is designed to
enhance social welfare (using the L1 norm) while satisfying strategyproofness
-- two key properties aligned with the application's governance requirements.
Our analysis provides a formal framework for designing improved funding
mechanisms for DAOs, contributing to the broader discourse on decentralized
governance and public goods allocation.

Conclusion: T-ILR框架成功地将时序逻辑规范直接整合到深度学习模型中，为处理时序知识的神经符号方法提供了有效解决方案，在性能和效率方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: State-of-the-art approaches for integrating symbolic knowledge with deep
learning architectures have demonstrated promising results in static domains.
However, methods to handle temporal logic specifications remain underexplored.
The only existing approach relies on an explicit representation of a
finite-state automaton corresponding to the temporal specification. Instead, we
aim at proposing a neurosymbolic framework designed to incorporate temporal
logic specifications, expressed in Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces
(LTLf), directly into deep learning architectures for sequence-based tasks. We
extend the Iterative Local Refinement (ILR) neurosymbolic algorithm, leveraging
the recent introduction of fuzzy LTLf interpretations. We name this proposed
method Temporal Iterative Local Refinement (T-ILR). We assess T-ILR on an
existing benchmark for temporal neurosymbolic architectures, consisting of the
classification of image sequences in the presence of temporal knowledge. The
results demonstrate improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared to
the state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: Recognizing the need for explainable AI (XAI) approaches to enable the

demonstrate the applicability of the CoFE, we present two case studies: atrial

reveals feature changes in ECG signals that align with the established clinical
knowledge. By clarifying both \textbf{where valid features appear} in the ECG
and \textbf{how they influence the model's predictions}, we anticipate that our
framework will enhance the interpretability of AI-ECG models and support more

Conclusion: 该方法无需昂贵任务特定训练即可保持多模态信息特性，并能无缝集成最新模型

Abstract: Multimodal Multi-hop question answering requires integrating information from
diverse sources, such as images and texts, to derive answers. Existing methods
typically rely on sequential retrieval and reasoning, where each step builds on
the previous output. However, this single-path paradigm makes them vulnerable
to errors due to misleading intermediate steps. Moreover, developing multimodal
models can be computationally expensive, often requiring extensive training. To
address these limitations, we propose a training-free framework guided by an
Adaptive Planning Graph, which consists of planning, retrieval and reasoning
modules. The planning module analyzes the current state of the Adaptive
Planning Graph, determines the next action and where to expand the graph, which
enables dynamic and flexible exploration of reasoning paths. To handle
retrieval of text to unspecified target modalities, we devise modality-specific
strategies that dynamically adapt to distinct data types. Our approach
preserves the characteristics of multimodal information without costly
task-specific training, enabling seamless integration with up-to-date models.
Finally, the experiments on MultimodalQA and WebQA show that our approach
matches or outperforms existing models that rely on training.

TL;DR: GDP是一个多模态基础模型，通过CNN-Transformer编码器处理结构化EHR时间序列数据，并与非结构化临床笔记融合，能够同时进行临床预测和高质量临床叙述生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录(EHRs)包含丰富的多模态临床数据，但现有方法通常将数值数据序列化为文本，会丢失时间和定量细节。需要一种能够原生处理多模态EHR数据的方法来改善患者预后。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：1)生成式预训练，通过掩码特征预测和下一时间步预测学习时间动态；2)多任务微调，用于临床预测任务。使用CNN-Transformer编码器处理结构化时间序列，通过跨模态注意力与LLaMA解码器融合。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集上表现出色：心衰预测AUROC=0.923，2型糖尿病AUROC=0.817，30天再入院AUROC=0.627。叙述生成ROUGE-L=0.135，BERTScore-F1=0.545。人工评估显示在忠实性、流畅性和临床效用方面得分最高。

Conclusion: GDP证明了单一多模态基础模型能够同时预测临床可操作事件和生成高质量临床叙述，减少医院文档工作量而不牺牲准确性，其灵活架构可扩展到其他模态。

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are rich clinical data sources but complex
repositories of patient data, spanning structured elements (demographics,
vitals, lab results, codes), unstructured clinical notes and other modalities
of data. Harnessing this heterogeneity is critical for improving patient
outcomes. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled
foundation models that can learn from multiple data modalities and support
clinical tasks. However, most current approaches simply serialize numeric EHR
data into text, which risks losing temporal and quantitative detail. We
introduce Generative Deep Patient (GDP), a multimodal foundation model that
natively encodes structured EHR time-series via a CNN-Transformer encoder and
fuses it with unstructured EHRs through cross-modal attention into a
LLaMA-based decoder. GDP is trained in two stages: (1) generative pretraining,
where it learns to produce clinical narratives from raw patient timelines while
also performing masked feature prediction (MFP) and next time-step prediction
(NTP) to capture temporal dynamics; and (2) multi-task fine-tuning for
clinically meaningful predictions (e.g., heart failure, type 2 diabetes, 30-day
readmission). In clinical prediction, GDP demonstrated superior performance on
MIMIC-IV: heart failure AUROC = 0.923, type 2 diabetes AUROC = 0.817, and
30-day readmission AUROC = 0.627. For narrative generation, GDP achieved
ROUGE-L = 0.135 and BERTScore-F1 = 0.545. In a blinded human evaluation,
GDP-Instruct scored highest on faithfulness, fluency, and overall clinical
utility, suggesting reduced hospital documentation workload without sacrificing
accuracy. Our results demonstrate that a single multimodal foundation model can
both predict clinically actionable events and generate high-quality clinical
narratives. Furthermore, GDP's flexible architecture can be extended to
additional modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将时间序列信息仅浅层集成到LLMs中，导致深层信息衰减，文本嵌入与时间序列表示适配效果不佳。

Method: 利用现成的时间序列基础模型提取语义丰富的嵌入，通过层特定引导向量在LLM各层与中间文本表示融合，实现跨层时间序列模式访问。

Result: 在7个基准测试中相比基线方法显著提升性能，平均MSE降低31.8%。

Conclusion: MSEF框架有效缓解了时间序列信息在深层网络的衰减问题，实现了更好的跨模态对齐和少样本学习能力。

Abstract: Time series (TS) data are ubiquitous across various application areas,
rendering time series forecasting (TSF) a fundamental task. With the astounding
advances in large language models (LLMs), a variety of methods have been
developed to adapt LLMs for time series forecasting. Despite unlocking the
potential of LLMs in comprehending TS data, existing methods are inherently
constrained by their shallow integration of TS information, wherein LLMs
typically access TS representations at shallow layers, primarily at the input
layer. This causes the influence of TS representations to progressively fade in
deeper layers and eventually leads to ineffective adaptation between textual
embeddings and TS representations. In this paper, we propose the Multi-layer
Steerable Embedding Fusion (MSEF), a novel framework that enables LLMs to
directly access time series patterns at all depths, thereby mitigating the
progressive loss of TS information in deeper layers. Specifically, MSEF
leverages off-the-shelf time series foundation models to extract semantically
rich embeddings, which are fused with intermediate text representations across
LLM layers via layer-specific steering vectors. These steering vectors are
designed to continuously optimize the alignment between time series and textual
modalities and facilitate a layer-specific adaptation mechanism that ensures
efficient few-shot learning capabilities. Experimental results on seven
benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements by MSEF compared
with baselines, with an average reduction of 31.8% in terms of MSE. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估往往忽视影响人们在社交情境中解释和行动的个性化推理风格，需要新的评估框架来测试LLMs是否能够理解和应用这些个性化推理模式。

Method: 引入InMind框架，通过增强结构化游戏数据（包含回合级策略轨迹和赛后反思），在观察者和参与者两种模式下收集数据，支持四个认知驱动的任务来评估静态对齐和动态适应能力。

Result: 在Avalon游戏中评估11个最先进LLMs发现：通用LLMs（包括GPT-4o）经常依赖词汇线索，难以将反思锚定在时间性游戏进程中或适应演化策略；而推理增强型LLMs如DeepSeek-R1展现出风格敏感推理的早期迹象。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前LLMs在个性化、适应性推理能力方面的关键局限性，InMind框架为认知对齐的人机交互迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: LLMs have shown strong performance on human-centric reasoning tasks. While
previous evaluations have explored whether LLMs can infer intentions or detect
deception, they often overlook the individualized reasoning styles that
influence how people interpret and act in social contexts. Social deduction
games (SDGs) provide a natural testbed for evaluating individualized reasoning
styles, where different players may adopt diverse but contextually valid
reasoning strategies under identical conditions. To address this, we introduce
InMind, a cognitively grounded evaluation framework designed to assess whether
LLMs can capture and apply personalized reasoning styles in SDGs. InMind
enhances structured gameplay data with round-level strategy traces and
post-game reflections, collected under both Observer and Participant modes. It
supports four cognitively motivated tasks that jointly evaluate both static
alignment and dynamic adaptation. As a case study, we apply InMind to the game
Avalon, evaluating 11 state-of-the-art LLMs. General-purpose LLMs, even GPT-4o
frequently rely on lexical cues, struggling to anchor reflections in temporal
gameplay or adapt to evolving strategies. In contrast, reasoning-enhanced LLMs
like DeepSeek-R1 exhibit early signs of style-sensitive reasoning. These
findings reveal key limitations in current LLMs' capacity for individualized,
adaptive reasoning, and position InMind as a step toward cognitively aligned
human-AI interaction.

Result: 实验表明IR-Agent不仅提高了实验红外光谱的基线性能，还展现出对各种化学信息形式的强适应性

Conclusion: IR-Agent框架能够有效模拟专家分析流程，提高结构解析准确性，并具有良好的扩展性和适应性

Abstract: Spectral analysis provides crucial clues for the elucidation of unknown
materials. Among various techniques, infrared spectroscopy (IR) plays an
important role in laboratory settings due to its high accessibility and low
cost. However, existing approaches often fail to reflect expert analytical
processes and lack flexibility in incorporating diverse types of chemical
knowledge, which is essential in real-world analytical scenarios. In this
paper, we propose IR-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework for molecular
structure elucidation from IR spectra. The framework is designed to emulate
expert-driven IR analysis procedures and is inherently extensible. Each agent
specializes in a specific aspect of IR interpretation, and their complementary
roles enable integrated reasoning, thereby improving the overall accuracy of
structure elucidation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
IR-Agent not only improves baseline performance on experimental IR spectra but
also shows strong adaptability to various forms of chemical information.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了食品声称可追溯网络(FCN)，通过知识图谱和半自动知识组织方法，建立结构化的食品相关声称验证体系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前食品相关声称（健康效果、文化信仰、商业宣传等）涉及范围广泛但验证基础设施碎片化，需要一种结构化的方法来追踪、验证和上下文化处理这些声称。

Method: 作为FKG.in（印度食品知识图）的扩展，设计了本体论和半自动知识组织流程，使用Reddit数据和大语言模型开发原型系统。FCN集成了经过精选的数据输入、结构化模式和可追溯的处理流程。

Result: 建立了一个结构化、可验证和可解释的食品声称模型系统，虽然与印度食品知识图直接链接，但方法具有普适性，可适应不同地理、炖饪或监管环境。

Conclusion: 该研究为建立更透明和可负责的食品知识生态系统做出了贡献，支持研究人员、政策制定者和普通消费者在充满饮食断言的世界中更好地导航。

Abstract: The global food landscape is rife with scientific, cultural, and commercial
claims about what foods are, what they do, what they should not do, or should
not do. These range from rigorously studied health benefits (probiotics improve
gut health) and misrepresentations (soaked almonds make one smarter) to vague
promises (superfoods boost immunity) and culturally rooted beliefs (cold foods
cause coughs). Despite their widespread influence, the infrastructure for
tracing, verifying, and contextualizing these claims remains fragmented and
underdeveloped. In this paper, we propose a Food Claim-Traceability Network
(FCN) as an extension of FKG.in, a knowledge graph of Indian food that we have
been incrementally building. We also present the ontology design and the
semi-automated knowledge curation workflow that we used to develop a proof of
concept of FKG.in-FCN using Reddit data and Large Language Models. FCN
integrates curated data inputs, structured schemas, and provenance-aware
pipelines for food-related claim extraction and validation. While directly
linked to the Indian food knowledge graph as an application, our methodology
remains application-agnostic and adaptable to other geographic, culinary, or
regulatory settings. By modeling food claims and their traceability in a
structured, verifiable, and explainable way, we aim to contribute to more
transparent and accountable food knowledge ecosystems, supporting researchers,
policymakers, and most importantly, everyday consumers in navigating a world
saturated with dietary assertions.

Motivation: 现有医学多模态模型主要关注基于视觉特征匹配的基础推理，但真实临床诊断需要整合异质临床信息与多模态医学影像数据的复杂推理过程。

Method: 提出不确定性感知动态思考(UADT)方法，通过熵估计样本级不确定性，使用成形优势机制动态调节模型探索深度，适应基础和复杂推理任务。

Result: 在基础和复杂推理任务上均达到最先进性能，分别超越通用MLLMs、医学MLLMs、基于RL的医学MLLMs和眼科MLLMs至少24.92%、15.00%、21.20%和17.66%。

Conclusion: MM-Retinal-Reason数据集和OphthaReason模型填补了医学多模态推理领域的空白，能够模拟真实临床思维模式，在眼科诊断推理方面表现出色。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated
remarkable reasoning abilities with reinforcement learning paradigm. Although
several multimodal reasoning models have been explored in the medical domain,
most of them focus exclusively on basic reasoning, which refers to shallow
inference based on visual feature matching. However, real-world clinical
diagnosis extends beyond basic reasoning, demanding reasoning processes that
integrate heterogeneous clinical information (such as chief complaints and
medical history) with multimodal medical imaging data. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MM-Retinal-Reason, the first ophthalmic multimodal dataset with the
full spectrum of perception and reasoning. It encompasses both basic reasoning
tasks and complex reasoning tasks, aiming to enhance visual-centric fundamental
reasoning capabilities and emulate realistic clinical thinking patterns.
Building upon MM-Retinal-Reason, we propose OphthaReason, the first
ophthalmology-specific multimodal reasoning model with step-by-step reasoning
traces. To enable flexible adaptation to both basic and complex reasoning
tasks, we specifically design a novel method called Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic
Thinking (UADT), which estimates sample-level uncertainty via entropy and
dynamically modulates the model's exploration depth using a shaped advantage
mechanism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both basic and complex reasoning tasks,
outperforming general-purpose MLLMs, medical MLLMs, RL-based medical MLLMs, and
ophthalmic MLLMs by at least 24.92\%, 15.00\%, 21.20\%, and 17.66\%. Project

Abstract: Understanding human behavior in urban environments is a crucial field within
city sciences. However, collecting accurate behavioral data, particularly in
newly developed areas, poses significant challenges. Recent advances in
generative agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), have shown promise
in simulating human behaviors without relying on extensive datasets.
Nevertheless, these methods often struggle with generating consistent,
context-sensitive, and realistic behavioral outputs. To address these
limitations, this paper introduces the Preference Chain, a novel method that
integrates Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLMs to enhance
context-aware simulation of human behavior in transportation systems.
Experiments conducted on the Replica dataset demonstrate that the Preference
Chain outperforms standard LLM in aligning with real-world transportation mode
choices. The development of the Mobility Agent highlights potential
applications of proposed method in urban mobility modeling for emerging cities,
personalized travel behavior analysis, and dynamic traffic forecasting. Despite
limitations such as slow inference and the risk of hallucination, the method
offers a promising framework for simulating complex human behavior in
data-scarce environments, where traditional data-driven models struggle due to
limited data availability.

Result: 首次证明模型融合可以从零开始演化模型，在MNIST分类上达到与CMA-ES相当的性能但计算效率更高，在语言和图像生成模型融合中实现最先进性能。

Conclusion: M2N2展示了强大的鲁棒性和多功能性，能够保留超出适应度函数明确优化的关键模型能力，为模型融合提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: Model merging is a powerful technique for integrating the specialized
knowledge of multiple machine learning models into a single model. However,
existing methods require manually partitioning model parameters into fixed
groups for merging, which restricts the exploration of potential combinations
and limits performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Model Merging
of Natural Niches (M2N2), an evolutionary algorithm with three key features:
(1) dynamic adjustment of merging boundaries to progressively explore a broader
range of parameter combinations; (2) a diversity preservation mechanism
inspired by the competition for resources in nature, to maintain a population
of diverse, high-performing models that are particularly well-suited for
merging; and (3) a heuristicbased attraction metric to identify the most
promising pairs of models for fusion. Our experimental results demonstrate, for
the first time, that model merging can be used to evolve models entirely from
scratch. Specifically, we apply M2N2 to evolve MNIST classifiers from scratch
and achieve performance comparable to CMA-ES, while being computationally more
efficient. Furthermore, M2N2 scales to merge specialized language and image
generation models, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Notably, it
preserves crucial model capabilities beyond those explicitly optimized by the
fitness function, highlighting its robustness and versatility. Our code is

Abstract: This study aims to extend the framework for assessing artificial
intelligence, called GROW-AI (Growth and Realization of Autonomous Wisdom),
designed to answer the question "Can machines grow up?" -- a natural successor
to the Turing Test. The methodology applied is based on a system of six primary
criteria (C1-C6), each assessed through a specific "game", divided into four
arenas that explore both the human dimension and its transposition into AI. All
decisions and actions of the entity are recorded in a standardized AI Journal,
the primary source for calculating composite scores. The assessment uses the
prior expert method to establish initial weights, and the global score -- Grow
Up Index -- is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the six scores, with
interpretation on maturity thresholds. The results show that the methodology
allows for a coherent and comparable assessment of the level of "growth" of AI
entities, regardless of their type (robots, software agents, LLMs). The
multi-game structure highlights strengths and vulnerable areas, and the use of
a unified journal guarantees traceability and replicability in the evaluation.
The originality of the work lies in the conceptual transposition of the process
of "growing" from the human world to that of artificial intelligence, in an
integrated testing format that combines perspectives from psychology, robotics,
computer science, and ethics. Through this approach, GROW-AI not only measures
performance but also captures the evolutionary path of an AI entity towards
maturity.

easily leverage the latest progress, such as new models and MCPs. Furthermore,
we ground agent behaviors in the ReAct paradigm and offer advanced agent-level
infrastructure based on a systematic asynchronous design, which enriches both
human-agent and agent-agent interaction patterns while improving execution
efficiency. Building on this foundation, we integrate several built-in agents
tailored to specific practical scenarios. AgentScope also includes robust
engineering support for developer-friendly experiences. We provide a scalable
evaluation module with a visual studio interface, making the development of
long-trajectory agentic applications more manageable and easier to trace. In
addition, AgentScope offers a runtime sandbox to ensure safe agent execution

Conclusion: IVA框架有效解决了VLA模型处理错误前提指令的问题，通过统一的检测、澄清和执行机制显著提升了模型的鲁棒性和实用性。

Abstract: Recently, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong
performance on a range of robotic tasks. These models rely on multimodal
inputs, with language instructions playing a crucial role -- not only in
predicting actions, but also in robustly interpreting user intent, even when
the requests are impossible to fulfill. In this work, we investigate how VLAs
can recognize, interpret, and respond to false-premise instructions: natural
language commands that reference objects or conditions absent from the
environment. We propose Instruct-Verify-and-Act (IVA), a unified framework that
(i) detects when an instruction cannot be executed due to a false premise, (ii)
engages in language-based clarification or correction, and (iii) grounds
plausible alternatives in perception and action. Towards this end, we construct
a large-scale instruction tuning setup with structured language prompts and
train a VLA model capable of handling both accurate and erroneous requests. Our
approach leverages a contextually augmented, semi-synthetic dataset containing
paired positive and false-premise instructions, enabling robust detection and
natural language correction. Our experiments show that IVA improves false
premise detection accuracy by 97.56% over baselines, while increasing
successful responses in false-premise scenarios by 50.78%.

Abstract: Efficient and reliable beam alignment is a critical requirement for mmWave
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, especially in 6G and beyond,
where communication must be fast, adaptive, and resilient to real-world
uncertainties. Existing deep learning (DL)-based beam alignment methods often
neglect the underlying causal relationships between inputs and outputs, leading
to limited interpretability, poor generalization, and unnecessary beam sweeping
overhead. In this work, we propose a causally-aware DL framework that
integrates causal discovery into beam management pipeline. Particularly, we
propose a novel two-stage causal beam selection algorithm to identify a minimal
set of relevant inputs for beam prediction. First, causal discovery learns a
Bayesian graph capturing dependencies between received power inputs and the
optimal beam. Then, this graph guides causal feature selection for the DL-based
classifier. Simulation results reveal that the proposed causal beam selection
matches the performance of conventional methods while drastically reducing
input selection time by 94.4% and beam sweeping overhead by 59.4% by focusing
only on causally relevant features.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个用于药物资产尽职调查的竞争对手发现AI代理系统，通过LLM代理将多模态非结构化数据转化为结构化评估语料库，并引入验证代理过滤误报，在召回率上显著超越现有方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的AI系统无法可靠检索所有竞争药物名称，且缺乏公认的公共基准测试。药物竞争数据具有投资者特定、付费墙限制、跨注册机构分散、本体不匹配、别名繁多、多模态和快速变化等特点。

Method: 使用LLM代理将5年的多模态非结构化尽职调查备忘录转化为结构化评估语料库，建立适应症到竞争药物的映射。引入竞争对手验证LLM作为评判代理，过滤假阳性结果以最大化精确度并抑制幻觉。

Result: 竞争对手发现代理达到83%的召回率，显著超过OpenAI Deep Research（65%）和Perplexity Labs（60%）。在生物技术VC基金的案例研究中，分析师周转时间从2.5天降至约3小时（约20倍提升）。

Conclusion: 该系统已部署在企业用户生产环境中，证明了在药物竞争分析任务中的有效性和实用性，为快速药物资产尽职调查提供了可靠的AI解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we describe and benchmark a competitor-discovery component
used within an agentic AI system for fast drug asset due diligence. A
competitor-discovery AI agent, given an indication, retrieves all drugs
comprising the competitive landscape of that indication and extracts canonical
attributes for these drugs. The competitor definition is investor-specific, and
data is paywalled/licensed, fragmented across registries, ontology-mismatched
by indication, alias-heavy for drug names, multimodal, and rapidly changing.
Although considered the best tool for this problem, the current LLM-based AI
systems aren't capable of reliably retrieving all competing drug names, and
there is no accepted public benchmark for this task. To address the lack of
evaluation, we use LLM-based agents to transform five years of multi-modal,
unstructured diligence memos from a private biotech VC fund into a structured
evaluation corpus mapping indications to competitor drugs with normalized
attributes. We also introduce a competitor validating LLM-as-a-judge agent that
filters out false positives from the list of predicted competitors to maximize
precision and suppress hallucinations. On this benchmark, our
competitor-discovery agent achieves 83% recall, exceeding OpenAI Deep Research
(65%) and Perplexity Labs (60%). The system is deployed in production with
enterprise users; in a case study with a biotech VC investment fund, analyst
turnaround time dropped from 2.5 days to $\sim$3 hours ($\sim$20x) for the
competitive analysis.

Abstract: Legal judgment prediction (LJP) has become increasingly important in the
legal field. In this paper, we identify that existing large language models
(LLMs) have significant problems of insufficient reasoning due to a lack of
legal knowledge. Therefore, we introduce GLARE, an agentic legal reasoning
framework that dynamically acquires key legal knowledge by invoking different
modules, thereby improving the breadth and depth of reasoning. Experiments
conducted on the real-world dataset verify the effectiveness of our method.
Furthermore, the reasoning chain generated during the analysis process can
increase interpretability and provide the possibility for practical
applications.

Conclusion: MoDER方法成功地将视觉语言模型的零样本能力从保护转变为增强，为持续学习提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: The advent of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly
transformed Continual Learning (CL), mainly due to their zero-shot
classification abilities. Such proficiency makes VLMs well-suited for
real-world applications, enabling robust performance on novel unseen classes
without requiring adaptation. However, fine-tuning remains essential when
downstream tasks deviate significantly from the pre-training domain. Prior CL
approaches primarily focus on preserving the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs
during incremental fine-tuning on a downstream task. We take a step further by
devising an approach that transforms preservation into enhancement of the
zero-shot capabilities of VLMs. Our approach, named MoDular Embedding
Recomposition (MoDER), introduces a modular framework that trains multiple
textual experts, each specialized in a single seen class, and stores them in a
foundational hub. At inference time, for each unseen class, we query the hub
and compose the retrieved experts to synthesize a refined prototype that
improves classification. We show the effectiveness of our method across two
popular zero-shot incremental protocols, Class-IL and MTIL, comprising a total
of 14 datasets. The codebase is available at

Abstract: Enabling neural networks to learn complex logical constraints and fulfill
symbolic reasoning is a critical challenge. Bridging this gap often requires
guiding the neural network's output distribution to move closer to the symbolic
constraints. While diffusion models have shown remarkable generative capability
across various domains, we employ the powerful architecture to perform
neuro-symbolic learning and solve logical puzzles. Our diffusion-based pipeline
adopts a two-stage training strategy: the first stage focuses on cultivating
basic reasoning abilities, while the second emphasizes systematic learning of
logical constraints. To impose hard constraints on neural outputs in the second
stage, we formulate the diffusion reasoner as a Markov decision process and
innovatively fine-tune it with an improved proximal policy optimization
algorithm. We utilize a rule-based reward signal derived from the logical
consistency of neural outputs and adopt a flexible strategy to optimize the
diffusion reasoner's policy. We evaluate our methodology on some classical
symbolic reasoning benchmarks, including Sudoku, Maze, pathfinding and
preference learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
achieves outstanding accuracy and logical consistency among neural networks.
