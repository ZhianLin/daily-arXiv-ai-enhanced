### [1] [GAZE:Governance-Aware pre-annotation for Zero-shot World Model Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14992)
*Leela Krishna,Mengyang Zhao,Saicharithreddy Pasula,Harshit Rajgarhia,Abhishek Mukherji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAZE pipeline自动化将原始长视频转换为丰富的多模态标注数据，用于世界模型训练，通过AI模型预标注和结构化输出显著提升标注效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决世界模型训练中大规模多模态数据集手动标注成本高、效率低的问题。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：(1)标准化360度视频格式并分片处理；(2)应用多种AI模型进行密集多模态预标注；(3)整合信号为结构化输出供人工验证。

Result: 每个审核小时节省约19分钟，人工审核量减少80%以上，生成高质量、隐私保护的数据集。

Conclusion: GAZE工作流为生成高质量世界模型训练数据提供了可扩展的蓝图，在保持吞吐量和治理的同时提升标注效率。

Abstract: Training robust world models requires large-scale, precisely labeled
multimodal datasets, a process historically bottlenecked by slow and expensive
manual annotation. We present a production-tested GAZE pipeline that automates
the conversion of raw, long-form video into rich, task-ready supervision for
world-model training. Our system (i) normalizes proprietary 360-degree formats
into standard views and shards them for parallel processing; (ii) applies a
suite of AI models (scene understanding, object tracking, audio transcription,
PII/NSFW/minor detection) for dense, multimodal pre-annotation; and (iii)
consolidates signals into a structured output specification for rapid human
validation.
  The GAZE workflow demonstrably yields efficiency gains (~19 minutes saved per
review hour) and reduces human review volume by >80% through conservative
auto-skipping of low-salience segments. By increasing label density and
consistency while integrating privacy safeguards and chain-of-custody metadata,
our method generates high-fidelity, privacy-aware datasets directly consumable
for learning cross-modal dynamics and action-conditioned prediction. We detail
our orchestration, model choices, and data dictionary to provide a scalable
blueprint for generating high-quality world model training data without
sacrificing throughput or governance.

### [2] [PC-UNet: An Enforcing Poisson Statistics U-Net for Positron Emission Tomography Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14995)
*Yang Shi,Jingchao Wang,Liangsi Lu,Mingxuan Huang,Ruixin He,Yifeng Xie,Hanqian Liu,Minzhe Guo,Yangyang Liang,Weipeng Zhang,Zimeng Li,Xuhang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PC-UNet模型和PVMC-Loss损失函数，用于解决PET图像低剂量去噪问题，通过整合物理数据提高图像保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PET临床使用受限，高剂量增加辐射暴露，低剂量引入泊松噪声，现有去噪方法无法有效处理导致图像失真和伪影。

Method: 开发Poisson Consistent U-Net模型，结合新的Poisson Variance and Mean Consistency Loss，利用物理数据约束，实现统计无偏的方差和梯度自适应。

Result: 在PET数据集测试中，PC-UNet提高了物理一致性和图像保真度，证明其有效整合物理信息的能力。

Conclusion: PC-UNet能够有效处理PET低剂量去噪问题，通过物理一致性约束提高图像质量，为临床低剂量PET应用提供可行方案。

Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is crucial in medicine, but its clinical
use is limited due to high signal-to-noise ratio doses increasing radiation
exposure. Lowering doses increases Poisson noise, which current denoising
methods fail to handle, causing distortions and artifacts. We propose a Poisson
Consistent U-Net (PC-UNet) model with a new Poisson Variance and Mean
Consistency Loss (PVMC-Loss) that incorporates physical data to improve image
fidelity. PVMC-Loss is statistically unbiased in variance and gradient
adaptation, acting as a Generalized Method of Moments implementation, offering
robustness to minor data mismatches. Tests on PET datasets show PC-UNet
improves physical consistency and image fidelity, proving its ability to
integrate physical information effectively.

### [3] [DeLeaker: Dynamic Inference-Time Reweighting For Semantic Leakage Mitigation in Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15015)
*Mor Ventura,Michael Toker,Or Patashnik,Yonatan Belinkov,Roi Reichart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeLeaker是一种轻量级、无需优化的推理时方法，通过直接干预模型的注意力图来缓解文本到图像模型中的语义泄漏问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像模型虽然发展迅速，但仍然容易受到语义泄漏的影响，即不同实体之间意外传递语义相关特征。现有的缓解策略通常基于优化或依赖外部输入。

Method: DeLeaker在扩散过程中动态重新加权注意力图，抑制过度的跨实体交互，同时加强每个实体的身份特征。该方法无需优化，在推理时直接操作。

Result: 实验表明DeLeaker始终优于所有基线方法，即使基线方法提供了外部信息。它实现了有效的泄漏缓解，同时不损害保真度或质量。

Conclusion: 这些结果强调了注意力控制的价值，为更语义精确的文本到图像模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have advanced rapidly, yet they remain vulnerable
to semantic leakage, the unintended transfer of semantically related features
between distinct entities. Existing mitigation strategies are often
optimization-based or dependent on external inputs. We introduce DeLeaker, a
lightweight, optimization-free inference-time approach that mitigates leakage
by directly intervening on the model's attention maps. Throughout the diffusion
process, DeLeaker dynamically reweights attention maps to suppress excessive
cross-entity interactions while strengthening the identity of each entity. To
support systematic evaluation, we introduce SLIM (Semantic Leakage in IMages),
the first dataset dedicated to semantic leakage, comprising 1,130
human-verified samples spanning diverse scenarios, together with a novel
automatic evaluation framework. Experiments demonstrate that DeLeaker
consistently outperforms all baselines, even when they are provided with
external information, achieving effective leakage mitigation without
compromising fidelity or quality. These results underscore the value of
attention control and pave the way for more semantically precise T2I models.

### [4] [UrbanVerse: Scaling Urban Simulation by Watching City-Tour Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15018)
*Mingxuan Liu,Honglin He,Elisa Ricci,Wayne Wu,Bolei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UrbanVerse是一个数据驱动的真实到仿真系统，可将众包城市游览视频转换为物理感知的交互式仿真场景，包含10万+标注城市3D资产的存储库和自动生成管线，显著提升城市导航代理的训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人工制作或程序生成的仿真场景缺乏可扩展性或无法捕捉真实世界的复杂性，需要多样化的高保真城市环境来训练城市嵌入式AI代理。

Method: UrbanVerse系统包括UrbanVerse-100K（10万+标注城市3D资产库）和UrbanVerse-Gen（从视频提取场景布局并使用检索资产实例化度量尺度3D仿真的自动管线）。

Result: UrbanVerse构建了来自24个国家的160个高质量场景，在仿真中保持真实世界语义和布局，人类评估的真实感与手动制作场景相当。在城市导航中，训练策略表现出缩放幂律和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: UrbanVerse在仿真中成功率比先前方法提高+6.3%，在零样本仿真到真实转移中提高+30.1%，仅需两次干预即可完成300米真实世界任务，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Urban embodied AI agents, ranging from delivery robots to quadrupeds, are
increasingly populating our cities, navigating chaotic streets to provide
last-mile connectivity. Training such agents requires diverse, high-fidelity
urban environments to scale, yet existing human-crafted or procedurally
generated simulation scenes either lack scalability or fail to capture
real-world complexity. We introduce UrbanVerse, a data-driven real-to-sim
system that converts crowd-sourced city-tour videos into physics-aware,
interactive simulation scenes. UrbanVerse consists of: (i) UrbanVerse-100K, a
repository of 100k+ annotated urban 3D assets with semantic and physical
attributes, and (ii) UrbanVerse-Gen, an automatic pipeline that extracts scene
layouts from video and instantiates metric-scale 3D simulations using retrieved
assets. Running in IsaacSim, UrbanVerse offers 160 high-quality constructed
scenes from 24 countries, along with a curated benchmark of 10 artist-designed
test scenes. Experiments show that UrbanVerse scenes preserve real-world
semantics and layouts, achieving human-evaluated realism comparable to manually
crafted scenes. In urban navigation, policies trained in UrbanVerse exhibit
scaling power laws and strong generalization, improving success by +6.3% in
simulation and +30.1% in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer comparing to prior
methods, accomplishing a 300 m real-world mission with only two interventions.

### [5] [NANO3D: A Training-Free Approach for Efficient 3D Editing Without Masks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15019)
*Junliang Ye,Shenghao Xie,Ruowen Zhao,Zhengyi Wang,Hongyu Yan,Wenqiang Zu,Lei Ma,Jun Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Nano3D是一个无需训练的3D物体编辑框架，通过FlowEdit和TRELLIS实现局部编辑，并引入区域感知合并策略Voxel/Slat-Merge，确保编辑区域与未编辑区域的一致性，同时构建了首个大规模3D编辑数据集Nano3D-Edit-100k。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D物体编辑方法效率低下、不一致，且难以保持未编辑区域，多视图渲染编辑后重建会引入伪影，限制了实用性。

Method: 将FlowEdit集成到TRELLIS中，通过前视图渲染引导局部编辑，并引入Voxel/Slat-Merge区域感知合并策略，自适应保持结构保真度。

Result: 实验表明Nano3D在3D一致性和视觉质量上优于现有方法，并构建了包含10万+高质量3D编辑对的大规模数据集。

Conclusion: 该工作解决了算法设计和数据可用性的长期挑战，显著提高了3D编辑的通用性和可靠性，为前馈3D编辑模型的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: 3D object editing is essential for interactive content creation in gaming,
animation, and robotics, yet current approaches remain inefficient,
inconsistent, and often fail to preserve unedited regions. Most methods rely on
editing multi-view renderings followed by reconstruction, which introduces
artifacts and limits practicality. To address these challenges, we propose
Nano3D, a training-free framework for precise and coherent 3D object editing
without masks. Nano3D integrates FlowEdit into TRELLIS to perform localized
edits guided by front-view renderings, and further introduces region-aware
merging strategies, Voxel/Slat-Merge, which adaptively preserve structural
fidelity by ensuring consistency between edited and unedited areas. Experiments
demonstrate that Nano3D achieves superior 3D consistency and visual quality
compared with existing methods. Based on this framework, we construct the first
large-scale 3D editing datasets Nano3D-Edit-100k, which contains over 100,000
high-quality 3D editing pairs. This work addresses long-standing challenges in
both algorithm design and data availability, significantly improving the
generality and reliability of 3D editing, and laying the groundwork for the
development of feed-forward 3D editing models. Project

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ECHO是一个从社交媒体真实使用案例构建图像生成基准测试的框架，通过分析GPT-4o Image Gen的31,000多个提示，发现了现有基准测试未覆盖的创意任务，能更好地区分最先进模型，并为模型质量评估提供新指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试滞后于图像生成模型的新能力发展，无法捕捉社交媒体上出现的真实使用案例，导致社区对进展的认知与正式评估之间存在差距。

Method: 从展示新颖提示和用户定性判断的社交媒体帖子中收集真实使用证据，构建包含31,000多个提示的数据集，用于评估图像生成模型。

Result: ECHO发现了现有基准测试中缺失的创意复杂任务（如跨语言产品标签重渲染、生成指定总额的收据），能更清晰地区分最先进模型，并通过社区反馈为模型质量评估设计新指标（如颜色、身份、结构变化测量）。

Conclusion: ECHO框架通过利用真实世界使用证据构建基准测试，能更准确地反映图像生成模型的实际能力，为评估新兴用例提供有效方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation, often driven by proprietary systems like
GPT-4o Image Gen, regularly introduce new capabilities that reshape how users
interact with these models. Existing benchmarks often lag behind and fail to
capture these emerging use cases, leaving a gap between community perceptions
of progress and formal evaluation. To address this, we present ECHO, a
framework for constructing benchmarks directly from real-world evidence of
model use: social media posts that showcase novel prompts and qualitative user
judgments. Applying this framework to GPT-4o Image Gen, we construct a dataset
of over 31,000 prompts curated from such posts. Our analysis shows that ECHO
(1) discovers creative and complex tasks absent from existing benchmarks, such
as re-rendering product labels across languages or generating receipts with
specified totals, (2) more clearly distinguishes state-of-the-art models from
alternatives, and (3) surfaces community feedback that we use to inform the
design of metrics for model quality (e.g., measuring observed shifts in color,
identity, and structure). Our website is at https://echo-bench.github.io.

### [7] [LoRAverse: A Submodular Framework to Retrieve Diverse Adapters for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15022)
*Mert Sonmezer,Matthew Zheng,Pinar Yanardag*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于子模框架的方法，用于从海量LoRA适配器中选择最相关且多样化的模型，解决用户在平台上面临的选择困难问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA模型虽然能够个性化预训练扩散模型，但平台上超过10万个适配器的庞大数量、多样性和缺乏结构化组织，使用户难以导航、选择和有效利用最合适的适配器。

Method: 将LoRA模型选择任务构建为组合优化问题，并提出一种新颖的子模框架来解决这一问题。

Result: 定量和定性实验表明，该方法能够在广泛领域生成多样化的输出。

Conclusion: 提出的子模框架有效解决了从大规模LoRA适配器数据库中选择相关且多样化模型的问题，为用户提供了更好的模型选择方案。

Abstract: Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) models have revolutionized the personalization of
pre-trained diffusion models by enabling fine-tuning through low-rank,
factorized weight matrices specifically optimized for attention layers. These
models facilitate the generation of highly customized content across a variety
of objects, individuals, and artistic styles without the need for extensive
retraining. Despite the availability of over 100K LoRA adapters on platforms
like Civit.ai, users often face challenges in navigating, selecting, and
effectively utilizing the most suitable adapters due to their sheer volume,
diversity, and lack of structured organization. This paper addresses the
problem of selecting the most relevant and diverse LoRA models from this vast
database by framing the task as a combinatorial optimization problem and
proposing a novel submodular framework. Our quantitative and qualitative
experiments demonstrate that our method generates diverse outputs across a wide
range of domains.

### [8] [BiomedXPro: Prompt Optimization for Explainable Diagnosis with Biomedical Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15866)
*Kaushitha Silva,Mansitha Eashwara,Sanduni Ubayasiri,Ruwan Tennakoon,Damayanthi Herath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BiomedXPro是一个进化框架，使用大语言模型作为生物医学知识提取器和自适应优化器，自动生成多样化的可解释自然语言提示对用于疾病诊断，在数据稀缺的少样本设置中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生物医学视觉语言模型在临床应用中因提示优化技术产生不可解释的潜在向量或单一文本提示而缺乏透明度的问题，这些限制影响了在高风险医疗环境中的可信度。

Method: 利用大语言模型作为生物医学知识提取器和自适应优化器，通过进化框架自动生成多样化的可解释自然语言提示对。

Result: 在多个生物医学基准测试中，BiomedXPro始终优于最先进的提示调优方法，特别是在数据稀缺的少样本设置中表现突出。

Conclusion: 通过生成多样化的可解释提示集合，BiomedXPro为模型预测提供了可验证的基础，是开发更可信和临床对齐AI系统的重要一步。

Abstract: The clinical adoption of biomedical vision-language models is hindered by
prompt optimization techniques that produce either uninterpretable latent
vectors or single textual prompts. This lack of transparency and failure to
capture the multi-faceted nature of clinical diagnosis, which relies on
integrating diverse observations, limits their trustworthiness in high-stakes
settings. To address this, we introduce BiomedXPro, an evolutionary framework
that leverages a large language model as both a biomedical knowledge extractor
and an adaptive optimizer to automatically generate a diverse ensemble of
interpretable, natural-language prompt pairs for disease diagnosis. Experiments
on multiple biomedical benchmarks show that BiomedXPro consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art prompt-tuning methods, particularly in data-scarce few-shot
settings. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates a strong semantic alignment
between the discovered prompts and statistically significant clinical features,
grounding the model's performance in verifiable concepts. By producing a
diverse ensemble of interpretable prompts, BiomedXPro provides a verifiable
basis for model predictions, representing a critical step toward the
development of more trustworthy and clinically-aligned AI systems.

*Mattia Segu,Marta Tintore Gazulla,Yongqin Xian,Luc Van Gool,Federico Tombari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOBIUS是一种用于通用实例分割的基础模型家族，通过瓶颈像素解码器、语言引导的不确定性校准损失和统一训练策略，在减少55%像素FLOPs和75%变换器解码器FLOPs的同时保持SOTA性能，仅需1/3训练迭代次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型虽然实现了SOTA的域内和零样本性能，但计算成本过高限制了在资源受限平台上的部署。需要设计能够在边缘设备上高效部署而不牺牲性能的架构。

Method: 1) 瓶颈像素解码器用于高效多尺度和多模态融合；2) 语言引导的不确定性校准损失用于自适应解码器剪枝；3) 简化的统一训练策略。

Result: MOBIUS在减少55%像素FLOPs和75%变换器解码器FLOPs的同时保持SOTA性能，仅需1/3训练迭代次数，在从高端加速器到移动硬件的各种设备上实现帕累托最优缩放。

Conclusion: MOBIUS为高性能计算平台和移动设备上的高效分割建立了新的基准，解决了现有模型在边缘部署中的计算效率问题。

Abstract: Scaling up model size and training data has advanced foundation models for
instance-level perception, achieving state-of-the-art in-domain and zero-shot
performance across object detection and segmentation. However, their high
computational cost limits adoption on resource-constrained platforms. We first
examine the limitations of existing architectures in enabling efficient edge
deployment without compromising performance. We then introduce MOBIUS, a family
of foundation models for universal instance segmentation, designed for
Pareto-optimal downscaling to support deployment across devices ranging from
high-end accelerators to mobile hardware. To reduce training and inference
demands, we propose: (i) a bottleneck pixel decoder for efficient multi-scale
and multi-modal fusion, (ii) a language-guided uncertainty calibration loss for
adaptive decoder pruning, and (iii) a streamlined, unified training strategy.
Unlike efficient baselines that trade accuracy for reduced complexity, MOBIUS
reduces pixel and transformer decoder FLOPs by up to 55% and 75%, respectively,
while maintaining state-of-the-art performance in just a third of the training
iterations. MOBIUS establishes a new benchmark for efficient segmentation on
both high-performance computing platforms and mobile devices.

TL;DR: COGS框架通过分解种子问题为感知和推理因子，系统重组生成大规模合成问答对，有效提升多模态大语言模型在图表等人工图像领域的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在缺乏大规模人工标注推理数据的人工图像领域（如图表、文档、网页）推理能力有限，需要数据高效的方法来提升其推理能力。

Method: 将种子问题分解为原始感知和推理因子，然后系统性地与新图像重组生成大量合成问答对，每个问题都配有子问题和中间答案，支持因子级过程奖励的强化学习。

Result: 在图表推理任务上，COGS显著提高了未见问题的性能，特别是在推理密集和组合问题上表现最佳。使用不同种子数据的因子级混合训练能在多个数据集上实现更好的迁移效果。

Conclusion: COGS框架能够诱导出泛化能力而非数据集特定的过拟合，且可扩展到图表之外的其他领域如网页分析。

Abstract: Pretrained multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong
performance on diverse multimodal tasks, but remain limited in reasoning
capabilities for domains where annotations are difficult to collect. In this
work, we focus on artificial image domains such as charts, rendered documents,
and webpages, which are abundant in practice yet lack large-scale human
annotated reasoning datasets. We introduce COGS (COmposition-Grounded
instruction Synthesis), a data-efficient framework for equipping MLLMs with
advanced reasoning abilities from a small set of seed questions. The key idea
is to decompose each seed question into primitive perception and reasoning
factors, which can then be systematically recomposed with new images to
generate large collections of synthetic question-answer pairs. Each generated
question is paired with subquestions and intermediate answers, enabling
reinforcement learning with factor-level process rewards. Experiments on chart
reasoning show that COGS substantially improves performance on unseen
questions, with the largest gains on reasoning-heavy and compositional
questions. Moreover, training with a factor-level mixture of different seed
data yields better transfer across multiple datasets, suggesting that COGS
induces generalizable capabilities rather than dataset-specific overfitting. We
further demonstrate that the framework extends beyond charts to other domains
such as webpages.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GDGen是一个统一物理动力学生成框架，从势能角度整合刚体、关节体和软体动力学，通过方向刚度扩展经典弹性动力学，实现几何无关的统一模拟系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字孪生世界需要能够处理复杂物理行为的通用具身智能体，现有方法难以统一处理不同类型的物理动力学。

Method: 从势能最小化原理出发，引入方向刚度扩展弹性动力学，使用专门网络建模材料属性，神经场表示几何无关的变形。

Result: 实验表明GDGen能稳健统一多种模拟范式，为创建交互式虚拟环境和训练机器人智能体提供通用基础。

Conclusion: GDGen提供了一个统一框架，能够处理多种物理动力学，为数字孪生和具身智能应用提供有力支持。

Abstract: Digital twin worlds with realistic interactive dynamics presents a new
opportunity to develop generalist embodied agents in scannable environments
with complex physical behaviors. To this end, we present GDGen (Generalized
Representation for Generalized Dynamics Generation), a framework that takes a
potential energy perspective to seamlessly integrate rigid body, articulated
body, and soft body dynamics into a unified, geometry-agnostic system. GDGen
operates from the governing principle that the potential energy for any stable
physical system should be low. This fresh perspective allows us to treat the
world as one holistic entity and infer underlying physical properties from
simple motion observations. We extend classic elastodynamics by introducing
directional stiffness to capture a broad spectrum of physical behaviors,
covering soft elastic, articulated, and rigid body systems. We propose a
specialized network to model the extended material property and employ a neural
field to represent deformation in a geometry-agnostic manner. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GDGen robustly unifies diverse simulation
paradigms, offering a versatile foundation for creating interactive virtual
environments and training robotic agents in complex, dynamically rich
scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出COLIPRI编码器家族，通过引入报告生成目标和结合视觉-语言预训练与纯视觉预训练，解决3D医学图像领域数据不足问题，在多个任务上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D医学图像领域的数据稀缺限制了当前视觉-语言编码器的能力，需要缓解数据不足的问题。

Method: 引入额外的归纳偏置：报告生成目标，并将视觉-语言预训练与纯视觉预训练结合，利用图像-文本对数据集和纯图像数据集，开发COLIPRI编码器家族。

Result: COLIPRI编码器在报告生成、分类探测和零样本分类任务上达到最先进性能，在语义分割任务上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 通过引入额外归纳偏置和结合不同预训练方法，能够有效缓解3D医学图像领域数据不足问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training, i.e., aligning images with paired text, is a
powerful paradigm to create encoders that can be directly used for tasks such
as classification and retrieval, and for downstream tasks such as segmentation
and report generation. In the 3D medical image domain, these capabilities allow
vision-language encoders (VLEs) to support radiologists by retrieving patients
with similar abnormalities or predicting likelihoods of abnormality. While the
methodology holds promise, data availability limits the capabilities of current
3D VLEs.
  In this paper, we alleviate the lack of data by injecting additional
inductive biases: introducing a report generation objective and pairing
vision-language pre-training with vision-only pre-training. This allows us to
leverage both image-only and paired image-text 3D datasets, increasing the
total amount of data to which our model is exposed. Through these additional
inductive biases, paired with best practices of the 3D medical imaging domain,
we develop the Comprehensive Language-image Pre-training (COLIPRI) encoder
family. Our COLIPRI encoders achieve state-of-the-art performance in report
generation, classification probing, and zero-shot classification, and remain
competitive for semantic segmentation.

TL;DR: 提出DRIFT方法，通过梯度空间转移推理知识来提升多模态大语言模型的推理能力，避免参数合并的不稳定性，在多个基准测试中表现优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型的推理能力通常落后于纯文本模型，现有方法需要大量资源进行监督微调或强化学习，而简单的参数合并方法效果不稳定且因模型而异。

Method: 提出DRIFT方法：预计算推理先验作为推理模型和多模态模型的参数差异，在微调过程中用该先验偏置梯度，实现推理知识的梯度空间转移。

Result: 在MathVista和MathVerse等基准测试中，DRIFT方法相比简单参数合并和监督微调能持续提升推理性能，以较低成本达到或超过资源密集型方法的水平。

Conclusion: DRIFT提供了一种轻量级且高效的解决方案，能够在保持多模态对齐的同时有效提升多模态大语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly advancing, yet their
reasoning ability often lags behind that of strong text-only counterparts.
Existing methods to bridge this gap rely on supervised fine-tuning over
large-scale multimodal reasoning data or reinforcement learning, both of which
are resource-intensive. A promising alternative is model merging, which
interpolates parameters between reasoning-enhanced LLMs and multimodal
variants. However, our analysis shows that naive merging is not always a "free
lunch": its effectiveness varies drastically across model families, with some
(e.g., LLaVA, Idefics) benefiting while others (e.g., Qwen) suffer performance
degradation. To address this, we propose Directional Reasoning Injection for
Fine-Tuning (DRIFT) MLLMs, a lightweight method that transfers reasoning
knowledge in the gradient space, without destabilizing multimodal alignment.
DRIFT precomputes a reasoning prior as the parameter-space difference between
reasoning and multimodal variants, then uses it to bias gradients during
multimodal fine-tuning. This approach preserves the simplicity of standard
supervised fine-tuning pipelines while enabling efficient reasoning transfer.
Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks, including MathVista
and MathVerse, demonstrate that DRIFT consistently improves reasoning
performance over naive merging and supervised fine-tuning, while matching or
surpassing training-heavy methods at a fraction of the cost.

Result: 婴儿日常视觉输入呈现相似图像簇与罕见变化图像交替的结构；机器学习实验显示模仿这种结构能改善小数据集的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 婴儿自然体验的块状结构可能支持早期类别学习，并为各种学习问题提供高效学习原则。

Abstract: Young children readily recognize and generalize visual objects labeled by
common nouns, suggesting that these basic level object categories may be given.
Yet if they are, how they arise remains unclear. We propose that the answer
lies in the statistics of infant daily life visual experiences. Whereas large
and diverse datasets typically support robust learning and generalization in
human and machine learning, infants achieve this generalization from limited
experiences. We suggest that the resolution of this apparent contradiction lies
in the visual diversity of daily life, repeated experiences with single object
instances. Analyzing egocentric images from 14 infants (aged 7 to 11 months) we
show that their everyday visual input exhibits a lumpy similarity structure,
with clusters of highly similar images interspersed with rarer, more variable
ones, across eight early-learned categories. Computational experiments show
that mimicking this structure in machines improves generalization from small
datasets in machine learning. The natural lumpiness of infant experience may
thus support early category learning and generalization and, more broadly,
offer principles for efficient learning across a variety of problems and kinds
of learners.

TL;DR: SaLon3R是一个用于长时序3D高斯泼溅重建的新框架，通过引入紧凑锚点基元和3D点Transformer，实现了冗余消除和几何一致性，能够在超过50个视图上以10+FPS进行在线重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长时序视频序列中预测逐像素高斯并将所有视图的高斯组合作为场景表示，导致大量冗余和几何不一致。

Method: 使用紧凑锚点基元通过可微分显著性感知高斯量化消除冗余，结合3D点Transformer优化锚点属性和显著性，实现区域自适应高斯解码。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法在50-90%冗余消除的同时，在新视角合成和深度估计方面达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SaLon3R无需已知相机参数或测试时优化，在单次前向传播中有效解决伪影并修剪冗余3DGS，展示了长时序通用3D重建的优越效率、鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled generalizable,
on-the-fly reconstruction of sequential input views. However, existing methods
often predict per-pixel Gaussians and combine Gaussians from all views as the
scene representation, leading to substantial redundancies and geometric
inconsistencies in long-duration video sequences. To address this, we propose
SaLon3R, a novel framework for Structure-aware, Long-term 3DGS Reconstruction.
To our best knowledge, SaLon3R is the first online generalizable GS method
capable of reconstructing over 50 views in over 10 FPS, with 50% to 90%
redundancy removal. Our method introduces compact anchor primitives to
eliminate redundancy through differentiable saliency-aware Gaussian
quantization, coupled with a 3D Point Transformer that refines anchor
attributes and saliency to resolve cross-frame geometric and photometric
inconsistencies. Specifically, we first leverage a 3D reconstruction backbone
to predict dense per-pixel Gaussians and a saliency map encoding regional
geometric complexity. Redundant Gaussians are compressed into compact anchors
by prioritizing high-complexity regions. The 3D Point Transformer then learns
spatial structural priors in 3D space from training data to refine anchor
attributes and saliency, enabling regionally adaptive Gaussian decoding for
geometric fidelity. Without known camera parameters or test-time optimization,
our approach effectively resolves artifacts and prunes the redundant 3DGS in a
single feed-forward pass. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate our
state-of-the-art performance on both novel view synthesis and depth estimation,
demonstrating superior efficiency, robustness, and generalization ability for
long-term generalizable 3D reconstruction. Project Page:

TL;DR: TGT框架通过文本引导的轨迹控制视频生成，使用位置感知交叉注意力和双CFG方案，实现了对多对象场景中外观和运动的精确控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成方法在复杂多对象场景中控制能力有限，缺乏轨迹与视觉实体间的清晰对应关系，需要更精确的局部控制机制。

Method: 提出文本引导轨迹(TGT)框架，使用位置感知交叉注意力(LACA)整合轨迹和局部文本信号，采用双CFG方案分别调节局部和全局文本指导，并开发数据管道生成带轨迹注释的训练数据。

Result: 实验表明TGT在视觉质量、文本对齐准确性和运动可控性方面优于现有方法，能够有效控制多对象场景的外观和运动。

Conclusion: TGT通过轨迹与文本的配对控制，为视频生成提供了直观的运动处理方式，显著提升了复杂场景的生成质量和控制精度。

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has advanced rapidly in visual fidelity, whereas
standard methods still have limited ability to control the subject composition
of generated scenes. Prior work shows that adding localized text control
signals, such as bounding boxes or segmentation masks, can help. However, these
methods struggle in complex scenarios and degrade in multi-object settings,
offering limited precision and lacking a clear correspondence between
individual trajectories and visual entities as the number of controllable
objects increases. We introduce Text-Grounded Trajectories (TGT), a framework
that conditions video generation on trajectories paired with localized text
descriptions. We propose Location-Aware Cross-Attention (LACA) to integrate
these signals and adopt a dual-CFG scheme to separately modulate local and
global text guidance. In addition, we develop a data processing pipeline that
produces trajectories with localized descriptions of tracked entities, and we
annotate two million high quality video clips to train TGT. Together, these
components enable TGT to use point trajectories as intuitive motion handles,
pairing each trajectory with text to control both appearance and motion.
Extensive experiments show that TGT achieves higher visual quality, more
accurate text alignment, and improved motion controllability compared with
prior approaches. Website: https://textgroundedtraj.github.io.

Conclusion: 扩散先验有潜力成为脑部MRI分析的通用工具，能够提高解剖保真度并改进现有深度学习方法的输出。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful generative models in
medical imaging. However, it remains a major challenge to combine these
data-driven models with domain knowledge to guide brain imaging problems. In
neuroimaging, Bayesian inverse problems have long provided a successful
framework for inference tasks, where incorporating domain knowledge of the
imaging process enables robust performance without requiring extensive training
data. However, the anatomical modeling component of these approaches typically
relies on classical mathematical priors that often fail to capture the complex
structure of brain anatomy. In this work, we present the first general-purpose
application of diffusion models as priors for solving a wide range of medical
imaging inverse problems. Our approach leverages a score-based diffusion prior
trained extensively on diverse brain MRI data, paired with flexible forward
models that capture common image processing tasks such as super-resolution,
bias field correction, inpainting, and combinations thereof. We further
demonstrate how our framework can refine outputs from existing deep learning
methods to improve anatomical fidelity. Experiments on heterogeneous clinical
and research MRI data show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance producing consistent, high-quality solutions without requiring
paired training datasets. These results highlight the potential of diffusion
priors as versatile tools for brain MRI analysis.

Motivation: 现有方法难以捕捉全切片图像中的全局依赖关系，限制了粗粒度结构的建模能力，影响诊断预测的鲁棒性

Method: 使用快速傅里叶变换从WSI中提取低频分量，通过FFT-Block（卷积层和Min-Max归一化）处理频域数据，然后将全局频域特征与空间补丁特征融合

Result: 在三个公共数据集和六种最先进MIL方法上测试，平均提升宏F1分数3.51%，AUC提升1.51%

Conclusion: 频域学习是捕捉WSI分类中全局依赖关系的有效机制，能够补充空间特征，提升计算病理学的可扩展性和准确性

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification relies on Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL) with spatial patch features, yet existing methods struggle to capture
global dependencies due to the immense size of WSIs and the local nature of
patch embeddings. This limitation hinders the modeling of coarse structures
essential for robust diagnostic prediction.
  We propose Fourier Transform Multiple Instance Learning (FFT-MIL), a
framework that augments MIL with a frequency-domain branch to provide compact
global context. Low-frequency crops are extracted from WSIs via the Fast
Fourier Transform and processed through a modular FFT-Block composed of
convolutional layers and Min-Max normalization to mitigate the high variance of
frequency data. The learned global frequency feature is fused with spatial
patch features through lightweight integration strategies, enabling
compatibility with diverse MIL architectures.
  FFT-MIL was evaluated across six state-of-the-art MIL methods on three public
datasets (BRACS, LUAD, and IMP). Integration of the FFT-Block improved macro F1
scores by an average of 3.51% and AUC by 1.51%, demonstrating consistent gains
across architectures and datasets. These results establish frequency-domain
learning as an effective and efficient mechanism for capturing global
dependencies in WSI classification, complementing spatial features and
advancing the scalability and accuracy of MIL-based computational pathology.

Motivation: 随着无人机技术的发展，视频数据量急剧增加，迫切需要高效的语义检索方法。现有跨模态方法主要针对地面视角设计，无法有效处理无人机视频的俯视视角、结构同质性和目标组合多样性等特性。

Method: 提出多语义自适应挖掘方法，包含自适应语义构建模块、分布驱动语义学习项和多样性语义项，通过词与无人机视频帧的细粒度交互来增强模态间交互。引入跨模态交互特征融合池化机制，减少复杂背景干扰。

Abstract: With the advancement of drone technology, the volume of video data increases
rapidly, creating an urgent need for efficient semantic retrieval. We are the
first to systematically propose and study the drone video-text retrieval (DVTR)
task. Drone videos feature overhead perspectives, strong structural
homogeneity, and diverse semantic expressions of target combinations, which
challenge existing cross-modal methods designed for ground-level views in
effectively modeling their characteristics. Therefore, dedicated retrieval
mechanisms tailored for drone scenarios are necessary. To address this issue,
we propose a novel approach called Multi-Semantic Adaptive Mining (MSAM). MSAM
introduces a multi-semantic adaptive learning mechanism, which incorporates
dynamic changes between frames and extracts rich semantic information from
specific scene regions, thereby enhancing the deep understanding and reasoning
of drone video content. This method relies on fine-grained interactions between
words and drone video frames, integrating an adaptive semantic construction
module, a distribution-driven semantic learning term and a diversity semantic
term to deepen the interaction between text and drone video modalities and
improve the robustness of feature representation. To reduce the interference of
complex backgrounds in drone videos, we introduce a cross-modal interactive
feature fusion pooling mechanism that focuses on feature extraction and
matching in target regions, minimizing noise effects. Extensive experiments on
two self-constructed drone video-text datasets show that MSAM outperforms other
existing methods in the drone video-text retrieval task. The source code and
dataset will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要评估一般跨模态问答能力，但不清楚全模态大语言模型是否真正实现了模态不变推理，还是存在模态特定偏见。

Method: 构建了包含60,828个多选题的大规模三模态基准XModBench，涵盖五个任务系列和六种模态组合，能够细粒度诊断模型的模态不变推理能力。

Result: 实验显示最强模型Gemini 2.5 Pro在空间时间推理上准确率低于60%，存在持续的模态差异（音频表现明显差于文本），以及系统性的方向不平衡（视觉作为上下文时一致性较低）。

Conclusion: 当前全模态大语言模型距离真正的模态不变推理还很远，XModBench可作为评估和改进跨模态能力的基础诊断工具。

Abstract: Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) aim to unify audio, vision, and text
understanding within a single framework. While existing benchmarks primarily
evaluate general cross-modal question-answering ability, it remains unclear
whether OLLMs achieve modality-invariant reasoning or exhibit modality-specific
biases. We introduce XModBench, a large-scale tri-modal benchmark explicitly
designed to measure cross-modal consistency. XModBench comprises 60,828
multiple-choice questions spanning five task families and systematically covers
all six modality compositions in question-answer pairs, enabling fine-grained
diagnosis of an OLLM's modality-invariant reasoning, modality disparity, and
directional imbalance. Experiments show that even the strongest model, Gemini
2.5 Pro, (i) struggles with spatial and temporal reasoning, achieving less than
60% accuracy, (ii) reveals persistent modality disparities, with performance
dropping substantially when the same semantic content is conveyed through audio
rather than text, and (iii) shows systematic directional imbalance, exhibiting
lower consistency when vision serves as context compared to text. These
findings indicate that current OLLMs remain far from truly modality-invariant
reasoning and position XModBench as a fundamental diagnostic tool for
evaluating and improving cross-modal competence. All data and evaluation tools
will be available at https://xingruiwang.github.io/projects/XModBench/.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在图像-文本描述数据和交错文档数据上持续预训练，但对图像-文本交错文档数据的高质量数据筛选研究不足。

Method: 采用半合成方法，利用原始图像生成对应四个质量级别的文本，创建样本-分数对来训练UniFilter分类器，用于筛选DataComp描述数据集和OBELICS交错数据集中的高质量数据。

Result: 基于UniFilter筛选数据预训练的MLLMs在零样本推理和上下文学习能力上显著优于基线方法，经过视觉监督微调后在多个基准测试中表现更强。

Conclusion: UniFilter能有效提升多模态预训练数据质量，带来下游任务性能的显著改善，并发布了相关数据集和模型供社区使用。

Abstract: The Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are continually pre-trained on a
mixture of image-text caption data and interleaved document data, while the
high-quality data filtering towards image-text interleaved document data is
under-explored. We propose to train an efficient MLLM as a Unified Mulitmodal
Data Quality Classifier to Filter both high-quality image-text caption and
interleaved data (UniFilter). To address the challenge of collecting diverse
labeled multimodal data, we introduce a semi-synthetic approach that leverages
readily available raw images and generates corresponding text across four
quality levels. This method enables efficient creation of sample-score pairs
for both caption and interleaved document data to train UniFilter. We apply
UniFilter to curate high-quality caption data from DataComp caption dataset and
interleaved data from the OBELICS image-text interleaved dataset. MLLMs
pre-trained on the filtered data demonstrate significantly enhanced
capabilities compared to those trained on baseline-filtered data, achieving
stronger zero-shot reasoning and in-context learning capabilities. After visual
supervised fine-tuning, these UniFilter-induced MLLMs achieve stronger
performance on various benchmarks, highlighting the downstream benefits of
high-quality multimodal pre-training. We release the synthetic training data
used for training UniFilter, the UniFilter model checkpoints, and the
high-quality interleaved document subset OBELICS-HQ, curated by UniFilter, to
the community for reproduction and further development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决组织病理学基础模型训练中的可重复性挑战，这些挑战主要源于软件随机性、硬件非确定性和超参数报告不一致。

Method: 在QUILT-1M数据集上训练CLIP模型，系统评估不同超参数设置（如RandomResizedCrop值、分布式训练策略、学习率）和数据增强策略在三个下游组织病理学数据集（PatchCamelyon、LC25000-Lung、LC25000-Colon）上的影响。

Result: 发现RandomResizedCrop值在0.7-0.8时表现最佳，分布式训练无局部损失提高了稳定性，学习率低于5.0e-5会降低性能，LC25000（Colon）数据集提供了最可重复的基准。

Conclusion: 计算病理学中的可重复性不仅依赖于透明文档，还需要精心选择的实验配置，研究提供了开发可重复数字病理学基础模型的实用指导规则。

Abstract: Reproducibility remains a critical challenge in foundation model training for
histopathology, often hindered by software randomness, hardware
non-determinism, and inconsistent hyperparameter reporting. To investigate
these issues, we trained a CLIP model on the QUILT-1M dataset and
systematically evaluated the impact of different hyperparameter settings and
augmentation strategies across three downstream histopathology datasets
(PatchCamelyon, LC25000-Lung, and LC25000-Colon). Despite variability across
runs, we identified clear trends: RandomResizedCrop values of 0.7-0.8
outperformed more aggressive (0.6) or conservative (0.9) settings, distributed
training without local loss improved stability, and learning rates below 5.0e-5
consistently degraded performance across all datasets. The LC25000 (Colon)
dataset consistently provided the most reproducible benchmark. These findings
highlight that reproducibility in computational pathology depends not only on
transparent documentation but also on carefully chosen experimental
configurations, and we provide practical rules to guide future efforts in
developing reproducible foundation models for digital pathology.

Motivation: 现有基于图像和文本提示的生成数据增强方法难以平衡保真度和多样性，因为合成过程中的表示往往与非必要的输入图像属性（如环境上下文）纠缠，与修改这些元素的文本提示产生冲突。

Method: 使用显著概念感知图像嵌入模型来减少合成过程中不相关视觉细节的影响，保持图像和文本输入之间的直观对齐，通过生成更好保留类判别特征并具有额外受控变化的图像来增强训练数据多样性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过减少不相关视觉细节的影响，有效平衡了生成图像的保真度和多样性，显著提升了数据增强效果和下游模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent generative data augmentation methods conditioned on both image and
text prompts struggle to balance between fidelity and diversity, as it is
challenging to preserve essential image details while aligning with varied text
prompts. This challenge arises because representations in the synthesis process
often become entangled with non-essential input image attributes such as
environmental contexts, creating conflicts with text prompts intended to modify
these elements. To address this, we propose a personalized image generation
framework that uses a salient concept-aware image embedding model to reduce the
influence of irrelevant visual details during the synthesis process, thereby
maintaining intuitive alignment between image and text inputs. By generating
images that better preserve class-discriminative features with additional
controlled variations, our framework effectively enhances the diversity of
training datasets and thereby improves the robustness of downstream models. Our
approach demonstrates superior performance across eight fine-grained vision
datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art augmentation methods with averaged
classification accuracy improvements by 0.73% and 6.5% under conventional and
long-tail settings, respectively.

Abstract: Prenatal diagnosis of Congenital Heart Diseases (CHDs) holds great potential
for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven solutions. However, collecting
high-quality diagnostic data remains difficult due to the rarity of these
conditions, resulting in imbalanced and low-quality datasets that hinder model
performance. Moreover, no public efforts have been made to integrate multiple
sources of information, such as imaging and clinical data, further limiting the
ability of AI models to support and enhance clinical decision-making. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce the Congenital Anomaly Recognition with
Diagnostic Images and Unified Medical records (CARDIUM) dataset, the first
publicly available multimodal dataset consolidating fetal ultrasound and
echocardiographic images along with maternal clinical records for prenatal CHD
detection. Furthermore, we propose a robust multimodal transformer architecture
that incorporates a cross-attention mechanism to fuse feature representations
from image and tabular data, improving CHD detection by 11% and 50% over image
and tabular single-modality approaches, respectively, and achieving an F1 score
of 79.8 $\pm$ 4.8% in the CARDIUM dataset. We will publicly release our dataset

Abstract: We present DriveGen3D, a novel framework for generating high-quality and
highly controllable dynamic 3D driving scenes that addresses critical
limitations in existing methodologies. Current approaches to driving scene
synthesis either suffer from prohibitive computational demands for extended
temporal generation, focus exclusively on prolonged video synthesis without 3D
representation, or restrict themselves to static single-scene reconstruction.
Our work bridges this methodological gap by integrating accelerated long-term
video generation with large-scale dynamic scene reconstruction through
multimodal conditional control. DriveGen3D introduces a unified pipeline
consisting of two specialized components: FastDrive-DiT, an efficient video
diffusion transformer for high-resolution, temporally coherent video synthesis
under text and Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) layout guidance; and FastRecon3D, a
feed-forward reconstruction module that rapidly builds 3D Gaussian
representations across time, ensuring spatial-temporal consistency. Together,
these components enable real-time generation of extended driving videos (up to
$424\times800$ at 12 FPS) and corresponding dynamic 3D scenes, achieving SSIM
of 0.811 and PSNR of 22.84 on novel view synthesis, all while maintaining

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the primary imaging modality used in the
diagnosis, assessment, and treatment planning for brain pathologies. However,
most automated MRI analysis tools, such as segmentation and registration
pipelines, are optimized for healthy anatomies and often fail when confronted
with large lesions such as tumors. To overcome this, image inpainting
techniques aim to locally synthesize healthy brain tissues in tumor regions,
enabling the reliable application of general-purpose tools. In this work, we
systematically evaluate state-of-the-art inpainting models and observe a
saturation in their standalone performance. In response, we introduce a
methodology combining model ensembling with efficient post-processing
strategies such as median filtering, histogram matching, and pixel averaging.
Further anatomical refinement is achieved via a lightweight U-Net enhancement
stage. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our proposed pipeline
improves the anatomical plausibility and visual fidelity of inpainted regions,
yielding higher accuracy and more robust outcomes than individual baseline
models. By combining established models with targeted post-processing, we
achieve improved and more accessible inpainting outcomes, supporting broader
clinical deployment and sustainable, resource-conscious research. Our 2025

TL;DR: 提出QCFace方法，通过硬边界策略解决人脸识别中可识别性与身份特征纠缠的问题，实现可识别性与身份表示的清晰解耦，在验证和识别任务中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人脸识别系统存在两个主要问题：可识别性仅通过软边界约束部分捕获，导致质量表示较弱；特征方向和幅度的梯度重叠引入优化不稳定性和表示纠缠。

Method: 引入硬边界策略QCFace，使用基于硬边界的损失函数，通过指导因子进行超球面规划，同时优化识别能力和明确的可识别性表示。

Result: 实验证实QCFace不仅提供鲁棒且可量化的可识别性编码，还在验证和识别基准测试中相比现有基于可识别性的损失函数达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: QCFace成功解决了可识别性与身份表示的纠缠问题，实现了两者的清晰解耦，为人脸识别系统提供了更优的特征表示。

Abstract: Recognizability, a key perceptual factor in human face processing, strongly
affects the performance of face recognition (FR) systems in both verification
and identification tasks. Effectively using recognizability to enhance feature
representation remains challenging. In deep FR, the loss function plays a
crucial role in shaping how features are embedded. However, current methods
have two main drawbacks: (i) recognizability is only partially captured through
soft margin constraints, resulting in weaker quality representation and lower
discrimination, especially for low-quality or ambiguous faces; (ii) mutual
overlapping gradients between feature direction and magnitude introduce
undesirable interactions during optimization, causing instability and confusion
in hypersphere planning, which may result in poor generalization, and entangled
representations where recognizability and identity are not cleanly separated.
To address these issues, we introduce a hard margin strategy - Quality Control
Face (QCFace), which overcomes the mutual overlapping gradient problem and
enables the clear decoupling of recognizability from identity representation.
Based on this strategy, a novel hard-margin-based loss function employs a
guidance factor for hypersphere planning, simultaneously optimizing for
recognition ability and explicit recognizability representation. Extensive
experiments confirm that QCFace not only provides robust and quantifiable
recognizability encoding but also achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
verification and identification benchmarks compared to existing
recognizability-based losses.

TL;DR: 提出首个双曲几何分类框架用于单正多标签学习，将标签表示为双曲球而非点或向量，通过几何球体交互建模丰富的标签关系，包括层次结构、共现模式和语义独立性。

Motivation: 解决单正多标签学习中每个训练样本仅标注一个正标签但可能属于多个类别的挑战性问题，现有方法缺乏对不同关系类型的显式几何定义。

Method: 使用双曲球表示标签，通过球体交互建模包含、重叠和分离关系；引入温度自适应双曲球分类器和物理启发的双势阱正则化。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验显示具有竞争力的性能，统计分析与真实世界共现模式强相关。

Conclusion: 双曲几何为不完全监督下的结构化分类提供了更鲁棒的范式，具有优越的可解释性。

Abstract: Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPMLL) addresses the challenging
scenario where each training sample is annotated with only one positive label
despite potentially belonging to multiple categories, making it difficult to
capture complex label relationships and hierarchical structures. While existing
methods implicitly model label relationships through distance-based similarity,
lacking explicit geometric definitions for different relationship types. To
address these limitations, we propose the first hyperbolic classification
framework for SPMLL that represents each label as a hyperbolic ball rather than
a point or vector, enabling rich inter-label relationship modeling through
geometric ball interactions. Our ball-based approach naturally captures
multiple relationship types simultaneously: inclusion for hierarchical
structures, overlap for co-occurrence patterns, and separation for semantic
independence. Further, we introduce two key component innovations: a
temperature-adaptive hyperbolic ball classifier and a physics-inspired
double-well regularization that guides balls toward meaningful configurations.
To validate our approach, extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets
(MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC, NUS-WIDE, CUB-200-2011) demonstrate competitive
performance with superior interpretability compared to existing methods.
Furthermore, statistical analysis reveals strong correlation between learned
embeddings and real-world co-occurrence patterns, establishing hyperbolic
geometry as a more robust paradigm for structured classification under
incomplete supervision.

TL;DR: SVG是一种新型的潜在扩散模型，无需变分自编码器，利用自监督表示进行视觉生成，通过结合DINO特征和轻量级残差分支构建语义结构化的潜在空间，实现更高效的扩散训练和生成质量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VAE+扩散范式存在训练效率低、推理速度慢、视觉任务迁移性差的问题，主要原因是VAE潜在空间缺乏清晰的语义分离和强判别结构。

Method: SVG利用冻结的DINO特征构建具有清晰语义判别性的特征空间，同时使用轻量级残差分支捕捉细粒度细节，直接在语义结构化的潜在空间上训练扩散模型。

Result: SVG实现了加速扩散训练、支持少步采样、提升生成质量，并保留了底层自监督表示的语义和判别能力。

Conclusion: SVG为任务通用、高质量的视觉表示提供了一条原则性路径，解决了传统VAE+扩散模型的局限性。

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion-based visual generation has largely relied on
latent diffusion models with variational autoencoders (VAEs). While effective
for high-fidelity synthesis, this VAE+diffusion paradigm suffers from limited
training efficiency, slow inference, and poor transferability to broader vision
tasks. These issues stem from a key limitation of VAE latent spaces: the lack
of clear semantic separation and strong discriminative structure. Our analysis
confirms that these properties are crucial not only for perception and
understanding tasks, but also for the stable and efficient training of latent
diffusion models. Motivated by this insight, we introduce SVG, a novel latent
diffusion model without variational autoencoders, which leverages
self-supervised representations for visual generation. SVG constructs a feature
space with clear semantic discriminability by leveraging frozen DINO features,
while a lightweight residual branch captures fine-grained details for
high-fidelity reconstruction. Diffusion models are trained directly on this
semantically structured latent space to facilitate more efficient learning. As
a result, SVG enables accelerated diffusion training, supports few-step
sampling, and improves generative quality. Experimental results further show
that SVG preserves the semantic and discriminative capabilities of the
underlying self-supervised representations, providing a principled pathway
toward task-general, high-quality visual representations.

Method: 1) 使用基于激活强度和权重范数的通道敏感度指标进行细粒度通道选择；2) 采用基于拼接的层合并方法融合相邻层的关键通道；3) 提出分层蒸馏协议，利用剪枝过程中建立的原始模型与剪枝模型层间对应关系进行知识迁移。

Abstract: Large Language Models excel at natural language processing tasks, but their
massive size leads to high computational and storage demands. Recent works have
sought to reduce their model size through layer-wise structured pruning.
However, they tend to ignore retaining the capabilities in the pruned part. In
this work, we re-examine structured pruning paradigms and uncover several key
limitations: 1) notable performance degradation due to direct layer removal, 2)
incompetent linear weight layer aggregation, and 3) the lack of effective
post-training recovery mechanisms. To address these limitations, we propose
CoMe, including a progressive layer pruning framework with a
Concatenation-based Merging technology and a hierarchical distillation
post-training process. Specifically, we introduce a channel sensitivity metric
that utilizes activation intensity and weight norms for fine-grained channel
selection. Subsequently, we employ a concatenation-based layer merging method
to fuse the most critical channels across adjacent layers, enabling progressive
model size reduction. Finally, we propose a hierarchical distillation protocol
that leverages the correspondences between the original and pruned model layers
established during pruning, thereby enabling efficient knowledge transfer.
Experiments on seven benchmarks show that CoMe achieves state-of-the-art
performance; when pruning 30% of LLaMA-2-7b's parameters, the pruned model
retains 83% of its original average accuracy. Our code is available at
https://github.com/MPI-Lab/CoMe.

Conclusion: Proto-Former通过原型学习和多数据集联合训练，有效提升了面部关键点检测的泛化能力和性能，代码已公开。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved facial landmark
detection. However, existing facial landmark detection datasets often define
different numbers of landmarks, and most mainstream methods can only be trained
on a single dataset. This limits the model generalization to different datasets
and hinders the development of a unified model. To address this issue, we
propose Proto-Former, a unified, adaptive, end-to-end facial landmark detection
framework that explicitly enhances dataset-specific facial structural
representations (i.e., prototype). Proto-Former overcomes the limitations of
single-dataset training by enabling joint training across multiple datasets
within a unified architecture. Specifically, Proto-Former comprises two key
components: an Adaptive Prototype-Aware Encoder (APAE) that performs adaptive
feature extraction and learns prototype representations, and a Progressive
Prototype-Aware Decoder (PPAD) that refines these prototypes to generate
prompts that guide the model's attention to key facial regions. Furthermore, we
introduce a novel Prototype-Aware (PA) loss, which achieves optimal path
finding by constraining the selection weights of prototype experts. This loss
function effectively resolves the problem of prototype expert addressing
instability during multi-dataset training, alleviates gradient conflicts, and
enables the extraction of more accurate facial structure features. Extensive
experiments on widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our Proto-Former
achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SHARE通过利用场景几何线索有效解决了人体运动重建中的3D空间定位问题，为各种应用提供了更准确的人体-场景交互重建

Abstract: Animating realistic character interactions with the surrounding environment
is important for autonomous agents in gaming, AR/VR, and robotics. However,
current methods for human motion reconstruction struggle with accurately
placing humans in 3D space. We introduce Scene-Human Aligned REconstruction
(SHARE), a technique that leverages the scene geometry's inherent spatial cues
to accurately ground human motion reconstruction. Each reconstruction relies
solely on a monocular RGB video from a stationary camera. SHARE first estimates
a human mesh and segmentation mask for every frame, alongside a scene point map
at keyframes. It iteratively refines the human's positions at these keyframes
by comparing the human mesh against the human point map extracted from the
scene using the mask. Crucially, we also ensure that non-keyframe human meshes
remain consistent by preserving their relative root joint positions to keyframe
root joints during optimization. Our approach enables more accurate 3D human
placement while reconstructing the surrounding scene, facilitating use cases on
both curated datasets and in-the-wild web videos. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SHARE outperforms existing methods.

Result: 在三个基准测试中均优于基线方法：两个大规模公共MI EEG数据集（超过50名受试者）和一个临床MI ECoG数据集（来自ALS患者）。

Conclusion: Cortical-SSM能有效捕获EEG和ECoG信号的神经生理相关区域，为运动想象分类提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocorticogram (ECoG)
signals obtained during motor imagery (MI) has substantial application
potential, including for communication assistance and rehabilitation support
for patients with motor impairments. These signals remain inherently
susceptible to physiological artifacts (e.g., eye blinking, swallowing), which
pose persistent challenges. Although Transformer-based approaches for
classifying EEG and ECoG signals have been widely adopted, they often struggle
to capture fine-grained dependencies within them. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Cortical-SSM, a novel architecture that extends deep
state space models to capture integrated dependencies of EEG and ECoG signals
across temporal, spatial, and frequency domains. We validated our method across
three benchmarks: 1) two large-scale public MI EEG datasets containing more
than 50 subjects, and 2) a clinical MI ECoG dataset recorded from a patient
with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Our method outperformed baseline methods on
the three benchmarks. Furthermore, visual explanations derived from our model
indicate that it effectively captures neurophysiologically relevant regions of
both EEG and ECoG signals.

Motivation: 微创手术需要自动化的手术工具检测来支持高级分析和辅助，但手术环境中标注数据有限，难以训练鲁棒的深度学习模型。

Method: 两阶段自适应微调方法：1）线性探测阶段在预训练CNN架构上调节额外分类层；2）渐进冻结阶段动态减少可微调层数，调节对手术领域的适应。该方法只需单次训练循环，无需多次迭代。

Result: 在Cholec80数据集上，使用ResNet-50和DenseNet-121预训练模型，该方法相比现有方法和标准微调技术提升了检测性能，达到96.4%的平均精度(mAP)。在CATARACTS眼科手术数据集上进一步验证了方法的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 渐进冻结微调是一种有前景的技术，可改进不同手术过程中的工具存在检测，在通用图像分类任务中具有更广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Minimally invasive surgery can benefit significantly from automated surgical
tool detection, enabling advanced analysis and assistance. However, the limited
availability of annotated data in surgical settings poses a challenge for
training robust deep learning models. This paper introduces a novel staged
adaptive fine-tuning approach consisting of two steps: a linear probing stage
to condition additional classification layers on a pre-trained CNN-based
architecture and a gradual freezing stage to dynamically reduce the
fine-tunable layers, aiming to regulate adaptation to the surgical domain. This
strategy reduces network complexity and improves efficiency, requiring only a
single training loop and eliminating the need for multiple iterations. We
validated our method on the Cholec80 dataset, employing CNN architectures
(ResNet-50 and DenseNet-121) pre-trained on ImageNet for detecting surgical
tools in cholecystectomy endoscopic videos. Our results demonstrate that our
method improves detection performance compared to existing approaches and
established fine-tuning techniques, achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of
96.4%. To assess its broader applicability, the generalizability of the
fine-tuning strategy was further confirmed on the CATARACTS dataset, a distinct
domain of minimally invasive ophthalmic surgery. These findings suggest that
gradual freezing fine-tuning is a promising technique for improving tool
presence detection in diverse surgical procedures and may have broader
applications in general image classification tasks.

Method: 构建了包含4种关键空间推理能力的合成数据集Spatial457，采用级联评估结构，包含7种问题类型和5个难度级别，从基本物体识别到复杂6D空间推理任务。

Result: 评估显示大型多模态模型在任务复杂度增加时性能普遍下降，特别是在3D推理和6D空间任务中，并发现了跨不同属性的预测偏差。

Conclusion: 大型多模态模型在复杂3D空间推理方面存在显著挑战，需要进一步改进，Spatial457数据集为评估和提升这些能力提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Although large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in visual scene interpretation and reasoning, their capacity for
complex and precise 3-dimensional spatial reasoning remains uncertain. Existing
benchmarks focus predominantly on 2D spatial understanding and lack a framework
to comprehensively evaluate 6D spatial reasoning across varying complexities.
To address this limitation, we present Spatial457, a scalable and unbiased
synthetic dataset designed with 4 key capability for spatial reasoning:
multi-object recognition, 2D location, 3D location, and 3D orientation. We
develop a cascading evaluation structure, constructing 7 question types across
5 difficulty levels that range from basic single object recognition to our new
proposed complex 6D spatial reasoning tasks. We evaluated various large
multimodal models (LMMs) on PulseCheck457, observing a general decline in
performance as task complexity increases, particularly in 3D reasoning and 6D
spatial tasks. To quantify these challenges, we introduce the Relative
Performance Dropping Rate (RPDR), highlighting key weaknesses in 3D reasoning
capabilities. Leveraging the unbiased attribute design of our dataset, we also
uncover prediction biases across different attributes, with similar patterns
observed in real-world image settings. The code and data are released in

Conclusion: FreqPDE方法能够有效提升多视图2D图像到3D物体检测的性能，无需LiDAR显式监督，解决了深度预测质量问题和跨视图一致性等挑战。

Abstract: Detecting 3D objects accurately from multi-view 2D images is a challenging
yet essential task in the field of autonomous driving. Current methods resort
to integrating depth prediction to recover the spatial information for object
query decoding, which necessitates explicit supervision from LiDAR points
during the training phase. However, the predicted depth quality is still
unsatisfactory such as depth discontinuity of object boundaries and
indistinction of small objects, which are mainly caused by the sparse
supervision of projected points and the use of high-level image features for
depth prediction. Besides, cross-view consistency and scale invariance are also
overlooked in previous methods. In this paper, we introduce Frequency-aware
Positional Depth Embedding (FreqPDE) to equip 2D image features with spatial
information for 3D detection transformer decoder, which can be obtained through
three main modules. Specifically, the Frequency-aware Spatial Pyramid Encoder
(FSPE) constructs a feature pyramid by combining high-frequency edge clues and
low-frequency semantics from different levels respectively. Then the Cross-view
Scale-invariant Depth Predictor (CSDP) estimates the pixel-level depth
distribution with cross-view and efficient channel attention mechanism.
Finally, the Positional Depth Encoder (PDE) combines the 2D image features and
3D position embeddings to generate the 3D depth-aware features for query
decoding. Additionally, hybrid depth supervision is adopted for complementary
depth learning from both metric and distribution aspects. Extensive experiments
conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority
of our proposed method.

Motivation: 现有3DGS方法假设物体在单一静态姿态下捕获，导致重建不完整，无法恢复被遮挡区域。需要解决从多姿态图像重建完整物体的实际挑战。

Method: 提出迭代融合策略，将辅助姿态图像集融合到主姿态的统一3DGS表示中。结合全局和局部配准方法，并智能整合3D基础模型进行跨姿态配准。

Conclusion: PFGS通过姿态感知融合策略有效解决了多姿态重建的挑战，在完整性和保真度方面表现出色。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled high-quality,
real-time novel-view synthesis from multi-view images. However, most existing
methods assume the object is captured in a single, static pose, resulting in
incomplete reconstructions that miss occluded or self-occluded regions. We
introduce PFGS, a pose-aware 3DGS framework that addresses the practical
challenge of reconstructing complete objects from multi-pose image captures.
Given images of an object in one main pose and several auxiliary poses, PFGS
iteratively fuses each auxiliary set into a unified 3DGS representation of the
main pose. Our pose-aware fusion strategy combines global and local
registration to merge views effectively and refine the 3DGS model. While recent
advances in 3D foundation models have improved registration robustness and
efficiency, they remain limited by high memory demands and suboptimal accuracy.
PFGS overcomes these challenges by incorporating them more intelligently into
the registration process: it leverages background features for per-pose camera
pose estimation and employs foundation models for cross-pose registration. This
design captures the best of both approaches while resolving background
inconsistency issues. Experimental results demonstrate that PFGS consistently
outperforms strong baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations,
producing more complete reconstructions and higher-fidelity 3DGS models.

Method: 基于高性能离线框架，通过潜在空间流式架构、滑动窗口因果设计和注入解码运动特征来确保平滑运动过渡，实现在线处理。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在风格化质量和响应性之间取得了良好平衡，能够实现长序列实时任意风格化。

Conclusion: LILAC成功将离线运动风格化框架扩展到在线设置，实现了高质量、低延迟的实时运动风格化，为需要连续响应性角色控制的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generating long and stylized human motions in real time is critical for
applications that demand continuous and responsive character control. Despite
its importance, existing streaming approaches often operate directly in the raw
motion space, leading to substantial computational overhead and making it
difficult to maintain temporal stability. In contrast, latent-space
VAE-Diffusion-based frameworks alleviate these issues and achieve high-quality
stylization, but they are generally confined to offline processing. To bridge
this gap, LILAC (Long-sequence Incremental Low-latency Arbitrary Motion
Stylization via Streaming VAE-Diffusion with Causal Decoding) builds upon a
recent high-performing offline framework for arbitrary motion stylization and
extends it to an online setting through a latent-space streaming architecture
with a sliding-window causal design and the injection of decoded motion
features to ensure smooth motion transitions. This architecture enables
long-sequence real-time arbitrary stylization without relying on future frames
or modifying the diffusion model architecture, achieving a favorable balance
between stylization quality and responsiveness as demonstrated by experiments
on benchmark datasets. Supplementary video and examples are available at the

TL;DR: 提出了MARIS基准和统一框架，解决水下开放词汇实例分割中的视觉退化和语义对齐问题，通过几何先验增强和语义对齐注入机制提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水下实例分割方法受限于封闭词汇预测，无法识别新的海洋类别，且从自然图像迁移到水下场景存在严重的视觉退化和语义错位问题。

Method: 提出统一框架包含两个组件：几何先验增强模块(GPEM)利用部分级和结构线索保持对象一致性；语义对齐注入机制(SAIM)用领域特定先验丰富语言嵌入。

Result: 在MARIS基准上的实验表明，该框架在领域内和跨域设置下均优于现有开放词汇基线方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为未来水下感知研究建立了坚实基础，有效解决了水下开放词汇分割的挑战。

Abstract: Most existing underwater instance segmentation approaches are constrained by
close-vocabulary prediction, limiting their ability to recognize novel marine
categories. To support evaluation, we introduce \textbf{MARIS}
(\underline{Mar}ine Open-Vocabulary \underline{I}nstance
\underline{S}egmentation), the first large-scale fine-grained benchmark for
underwater Open-Vocabulary (OV) segmentation, featuring a limited set of seen
categories and diverse unseen categories. Although OV segmentation has shown
promise on natural images, our analysis reveals that transfer to underwater
scenes suffers from severe visual degradation (e.g., color attenuation) and
semantic misalignment caused by lack underwater class definitions. To address
these issues, we propose a unified framework with two complementary components.
The Geometric Prior Enhancement Module (\textbf{GPEM}) leverages stable
part-level and structural cues to maintain object consistency under degraded
visual conditions. The Semantic Alignment Injection Mechanism (\textbf{SAIM})
enriches language embeddings with domain-specific priors, mitigating semantic
ambiguity and improving recognition of unseen categories. Experiments show that
our framework consistently outperforms existing OV baselines both In-Domain and
Cross-Domain setting on MARIS, establishing a strong foundation for future
underwater perception research.

TL;DR: 提出了LoSP-Prompt重建框架，通过物理建模和合成数据驱动的提示学习解决多器官多切片多方向多b值扩散加权成像中的运动伪影问题，实现了高分辨率、多器官泛化的临床应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床采用多器官扩散加权磁共振成像受到呼吸、蠕动等运动引起的严重相位伪影限制，同时面临多器官、多切片、多方向和多b值的复杂性挑战。

Method: 将帧间相位变化建模为高阶局部平滑相位，集成到低秩Hankel矩阵重建中，通过仅使用模拟生理运动的合成腹部DWI数据进行提示学习自动设置算法秩参数。

Result: 在10,000+临床图像验证中：1）实现临床单次激发DWI两倍空间分辨率；2）单一模型泛化到7个不同解剖区域；3）在图像质量、伪影抑制和噪声降低方面优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法消除了导航信号和真实数据监督，为高分辨率多器官多激发DWI提供了可解释的鲁棒解决方案，其扫描仪无关性能在精准肿瘤学中具有变革潜力。

Abstract: Clinical adoption of multi-shot diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging
(multi-shot DWI) for body-wide tumor diagnostics is limited by severe
motion-induced phase artifacts from respiration, peristalsis, and so on,
compounded by multi-organ, multi-slice, multi-direction and multi-b-value
complexities. Here, we introduce a reconstruction framework, LoSP-Prompt, that
overcomes these challenges through physics-informed modeling and
synthetic-data-driven prompt learning. We model inter-shot phase variations as
a high-order Locally Smooth Phase (LoSP), integrated into a low-rank Hankel
matrix reconstruction. Crucially, the algorithm's rank parameter is
automatically set via prompt learning trained exclusively on synthetic
abdominal DWI data emulating physiological motion. Validated across 10,000+
clinical images (43 subjects, 4 scanner models, 5 centers), LoSP-Prompt: (1)
Achieved twice the spatial resolution of clinical single-shot DWI, enhancing
liver lesion conspicuity; (2) Generalized to seven diverse anatomical regions
(liver, kidney, sacroiliac, pelvis, knee, spinal cord, brain) with a single
model; (3) Outperformed state-of-the-art methods in image quality, artifact
suppression, and noise reduction (11 radiologists' evaluations on a 5-point
scale, $p<0.05$), achieving 4-5 points (excellent) on kidney DWI, 4 points
(good to excellent) on liver, sacroiliac and spinal cord DWI, and 3-4 points
(good) on knee and tumor brain. The approach eliminates navigator signals and
realistic data supervision, providing an interpretable, robust solution for
high-resolution multi-organ multi-shot DWI. Its scanner-agnostic performance
signifies transformative potential for precision oncology.

TL;DR: 提出LoD框架，通过任务特定学习而非攻击特定学习来检测未知的越狱攻击，包含多模态安全概念激活向量和安全模式自编码器模块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱攻击检测方法要么学习攻击特定参数导致泛化能力差，要么依赖启发式原则限制准确性和效率。

Method: LoD框架包含：1）多模态安全概念激活向量模块进行安全导向表示学习；2）安全模式自编码器模块进行无监督攻击分类。

Result: 在多种未知攻击上实现了更高的检测AUROC，同时提高了效率。

Conclusion: LoD框架通过任务特定学习有效检测未知越狱攻击，具有更好的泛化能力和效率。

Abstract: Despite extensive alignment efforts, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, posing serious safety risks. To address
this, existing detection methods either learn attack-specific parameters, which
hinders generalization to unseen attacks, or rely on heuristically sound
principles, which limit accuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations,
we propose Learning to Detect (LoD), a general framework that accurately
detects unknown jailbreak attacks by shifting the focus from attack-specific
learning to task-specific learning. This framework includes a Multi-modal
Safety Concept Activation Vector module for safety-oriented representation
learning and a Safety Pattern Auto-Encoder module for unsupervised attack
classification. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
consistently higher detection AUROC on diverse unknown attacks while improving
efficiency. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Semantic4Safety框架，使用零样本语义分割从街景图像中提取11个可解释的街道指标，结合道路类型分析3万起交通事故记录，通过XGBoost分类和SHAP解释特征贡献，并应用GPS加权和ATE估计量化因果效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决街景图像在交通风险评估中的两个基本挑战：如何构建捕捉事故相关特征的街道级指标，以及如何量化它们对不同事故类型的因果影响。

Method: 应用零样本语义分割从街景图像中提取11个可解释的街道景观指标，结合道路类型作为上下文信息；训练XGBoost多类分类器并使用SHAP解释全局和局部特征贡献；应用广义倾向得分加权和平均处理效应估计来控制混杂因素并量化因果效应。

Result: 发现异质性的、特定于事故类型的因果模式：捕捉场景复杂性、暴露度和道路几何形状的特征主导预测能力；更大的可驾驶区域和应急空间降低风险，而过度视觉开放性可能增加风险。

Conclusion: 通过将预测建模与因果推断相结合，Semantic4Safety支持有针对性的干预措施和高风险走廊诊断，为城市道路安全规划提供了一个可扩展的、数据驱动的工具。

Abstract: Street-view imagery (SVI) offers a fine-grained lens on traffic risk, yet two
fundamental challenges persist: (1) how to construct street-level indicators
that capture accident-related features, and (2) how to quantify their causal
impacts across different accident types. To address these challenges, we
propose Semantic4Safety, a framework that applies zero-shot semantic
segmentation to SVIs to derive 11 interpretable streetscape indicators, and
integrates road type as contextual information to analyze approximately 30,000
accident records in Austin. Specifically, we train an eXtreme Gradient Boosting
(XGBoost) multi-class classifier and use Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP)
to interpret both global and local feature contributions, and then apply
Generalized Propensity Score (GPS) weighting and Average Treatment Effect (ATE)
estimation to control confounding and quantify causal effects. Results uncover
heterogeneous, accident-type-specific causal patterns: features capturing scene
complexity, exposure, and roadway geometry dominate predictive power; larger
drivable area and emergency space reduce risk, whereas excessive visual
openness can increase it. By bridging predictive modeling with causal
inference, Semantic4Safety supports targeted interventions and high-risk
corridor diagnosis, offering a scalable, data-informed tool for urban road
safety planning.

TL;DR: 提出Predictive-Corrective（PC）范式，通过解耦建模任务加速学习。PCMambaNet包含预测先验模块和校正残差网络，在脑MRI分割中仅需1-5个epoch即可达到最先进精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决端到端深度学习收敛慢、依赖大数据集的问题，特别是在医学成像等数据稀缺领域提高学习效率和适用性。

Method: PC范式将任务解耦为两个协同模块：预测先验模块（PPM）利用解剖知识生成粗略近似，校正残差网络（CRN）学习残差误差，专注于精炼挑战性区域。

Result: 在高分辨率脑MRI分割实验中，PCMambaNet达到最先进精度，仅需1-5个epoch收敛，远超传统端到端模型。

Conclusion: 通过显式融入领域知识简化学习目标，PCMambaNet有效缓解数据低效和过拟合问题，实现显著加速。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of the end-to-end paradigm in deep learning,
it often suffers from slow convergence and heavy reliance on large-scale
datasets, which fundamentally limits its efficiency and applicability in
data-scarce domains such as medical imaging. In this work, we introduce the
Predictive-Corrective (PC) paradigm, a framework that decouples the modeling
task to fundamentally accelerate learning. Building upon this paradigm, we
propose a novel network, termed PCMambaNet. PCMambaNet is composed of two
synergistic modules. First, the Predictive Prior Module (PPM) generates a
coarse approximation at low computational cost, thereby anchoring the search
space. Specifically, the PPM leverages anatomical knowledge-bilateral
symmetry-to predict a 'focus map' of diagnostically relevant asymmetric
regions. Next, the Corrective Residual Network (CRN) learns to model the
residual error, focusing the network's full capacity on refining these
challenging regions and delineating precise pathological boundaries. Extensive
experiments on high-resolution brain MRI segmentation demonstrate that
PCMambaNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while converging within only 1-5
epochs-a performance unattainable by conventional end-to-end models. This
dramatic acceleration highlights that by explicitly incorporating domain
knowledge to simplify the learning objective, PCMambaNet effectively mitigates
data inefficiency and overfitting.

TL;DR: 提出证据优先的自适应框架EARL，通过强化学习让模型主动选择最相关帧并进行局部重采样，在多个视频推理基准上达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频LLM存在信息稀释问题，静态均匀采样会掩盖关键证据；现有像素空间视频推理代理缺乏严格的奖励机制来确保证据纯度，且无法在预采样帧之外进行时间信息补充

Method: 提出证据感知强化学习(EARL)框架，让模型成为证据的主动询问者，动态选择最相关帧并在关键帧周围进行局部重采样以获取细粒度时间细节

Result: 在五个视频推理基准测试中达到开源视频LLM的最新SOTA，7B模型在LongVideoBench上达到59.8%，MVBench上69.0%，VideoMME上64.9%

Conclusion: 证据纯度的优先考虑至关重要，EARL框架通过"选择更少，推理更多"的核心理念有效提升了长视频推理能力

Abstract: Long-form video reasoning remains a major challenge for Video Large Language
Models (Video LLMs), as static uniform frame sampling leads to information
dilution and obscures critical evidence. Furthermore, existing pixel-space
video reasoning agents, which are designed to actively interact with the video
to acquire new visual information, remain suboptimal due to their lack of
rigorous reward mechanisms to enforce evidence purity and their inability to
perform temporal information supplementation beyond pre-sampled frames. To
address this critical gap, we propose a novel evidence-prioritized adaptive
framework built upon our core philosophy: "Select Less, Reason More." Our core
contribution is the evidence-aware reinforcement learning (EARL) framework,
which transforms the model into an active interrogator of evidence. EARL is
precisely engineered to dynamically select the most relevant frames and,
crucially, to perform localized re-sampling around the selected key frames to
access fine-grained temporal detail. Extensive experiments on five demanding
video reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our EARL-trained model achieves new
state-of-the-art among open-source Video LLMs, simultaneously learning an
effective and high-purity visual evidence selection policy. Impressively, our
7B model achieves 59.8% on LongVideoBench, 69.0% on MVBench and 64.9% on
VideoMME. These results highlight the importance of prioritizing evidence
purity and the effectiveness of our framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的仅依赖RGB数据的视觉识别模型难以捕捉MAV复杂的时空运动特征，限制了区分不同动作的能力。

Method: 使用ResNet编码器从每个视角提取特征，采用多尺度特征金字塔保持时空细节，引入跨视角注意力模块建模多模态依赖关系，设计多视角对齐损失确保语义一致性。

Result: 在基准MAV动作数据集上，该方法在Short MAV、Medium MAV和Long MAV数据集上分别达到97.8%、96.5%和92.8%的准确率，明显优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MAVR-Net通过多视角学习和跨模态交互，有效提升了MAV动作识别的性能，为自主飞行器群协同感知提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Recognizing the motion of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) is crucial for
enabling cooperative perception and control in autonomous aerial swarms. Yet,
vision-based recognition models relying only on RGB data often fail to capture
the complex spatial temporal characteristics of MAV motion, which limits their
ability to distinguish different actions. To overcome this problem, this paper
presents MAVR-Net, a multi-view learning-based MAV action recognition
framework. Unlike traditional single-view methods, the proposed approach
combines three complementary types of data, including raw RGB frames, optical
flow, and segmentation masks, to improve the robustness and accuracy of MAV
motion recognition. Specifically, ResNet-based encoders are used to extract
discriminative features from each view, and a multi-scale feature pyramid is
adopted to preserve the spatiotemporal details of MAV motion patterns. To
enhance the interaction between different views, a cross-view attention module
is introduced to model the dependencies among various modalities and feature
scales. In addition, a multi-view alignment loss is designed to ensure semantic
consistency and strengthen cross-view feature representations. Experimental
results on benchmark MAV action datasets show that our method clearly
outperforms existing approaches, achieving 97.8\%, 96.5\%, and 92.8\% accuracy
on the Short MAV, Medium MAV, and Long MAV datasets, respectively.

TL;DR: DPTrack是一种基于提示学习的夜间航拍跟踪器，通过将目标属性特征编码到包含细粒度线索的方向核中，生成精确的提示来提升跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示学习的夜间航拍跟踪器仅依赖空间定位监督，无法提供指向目标特征的细粒度线索，导致提示模糊，影响跟踪器准确聚焦目标特征的能力。

Method: 受视觉仿生学启发，DPTrack首先分层捕获目标的拓扑结构，利用拓扑属性丰富特征表示；然后编码器将这些拓扑感知特征压缩到方向核中；最后基于通道-类别对应关系的核引导提示模块在搜索区域特征中传播核，定位目标特征位置并转换为精确提示。

Result: 在已建立的基准测试上进行广泛评估，证明了DPTrack的优越性能。

Conclusion: DPTrack通过编码目标属性特征到方向核并生成精确提示，有效解决了夜间航拍跟踪中提示模糊的问题，实现了鲁棒的夜间跟踪。

Abstract: Existing nighttime aerial trackers based on prompt learning rely solely on
spatial localization supervision, which fails to provide fine-grained cues that
point to target features and inevitably produces vague prompts. This limitation
impairs the tracker's ability to accurately focus on the object features and
results in trackers still performing poorly. To address this issue, we propose
DPTrack, a prompt-based aerial tracker designed for nighttime scenarios by
encoding the given object's attribute features into the directional kernel
enriched with fine-grained cues to generate precise prompts. Specifically,
drawing inspiration from visual bionics, DPTrack first hierarchically captures
the object's topological structure, leveraging topological attributes to enrich
the feature representation. Subsequently, an encoder condenses these
topology-aware features into the directional kernel, which serves as the core
guidance signal that explicitly encapsulates the object's fine-grained
attribute cues. Finally, a kernel-guided prompt module built on
channel-category correspondence attributes propagates the kernel across the
features of the search region to pinpoint the positions of target features and
convert them into precise prompts, integrating spatial gating for robust
nighttime tracking. Extensive evaluations on established benchmarks demonstrate
DPTrack's superior performance. Our code will be available at
https://github.com/zzq-vipsl/DPTrack.

Motivation: 微表情识别面临标注数据稀缺的问题，现有方法主要依赖简单的空间增强而忽视了时间增强策略，限制了运动模式的多样性捕捉。

Method: 将每个微表情序列分解为起始到顶点和顶点到结束两个运动阶段，为每个阶段生成独立的动态图像，形成双阶段动态图像增强策略。

Result: 在CASME-II和SAMM数据集上的实验表明，该方法在识别准确率、未加权F1分数和未加权平均召回率方面均取得一致提升，结合空间增强可获得高达10%的相对改进。

Conclusion: 该方法简单、模型无关且在低资源设置下有效，为鲁棒和可泛化的微表情识别提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are brief, involuntary facial movements that reveal
genuine emotions, typically lasting less than half a second. Recognizing these
subtle expressions is critical for applications in psychology, security, and
behavioral analysis. Although deep learning has enabled significant advances in
micro-expression recognition (MER), its effectiveness is limited by the
scarcity of annotated ME datasets. This data limitation not only hinders
generalization but also restricts the diversity of motion patterns captured
during training. Existing MER studies predominantly rely on simple spatial
augmentations (e.g., flipping, rotation) and overlook temporal augmentation
strategies that can better exploit motion characteristics. To address this gap,
this paper proposes a phase-aware temporal augmentation method based on dynamic
image. Rather than encoding the entire expression as a single onset-to-offset
dynamic image (DI), our approach decomposes each expression sequence into two
motion phases: onset-to-apex and apex-to-offset. A separate DI is generated for
each phase, forming a Dual-phase DI augmentation strategy. These phase-specific
representations enrich motion diversity and introduce complementary temporal
cues that are crucial for recognizing subtle facial transitions. Extensive
experiments on CASME-II and SAMM datasets using six deep architectures,
including CNNs, Vision Transformer, and the lightweight LEARNet, demonstrate
consistent performance improvements in recognition accuracy, unweighted
F1-score, and unweighted average recall, which are crucial for addressing class
imbalance in MER. When combined with spatial augmentations, our method achieves
up to a 10\% relative improvement. The proposed augmentation is simple,
model-agnostic, and effective in low-resource settings, offering a promising
direction for robust and generalizable MER.

Motivation: 传统SfM方法在应用于多相机系统捕捉的驾驶场景时面临三大挑战：相机位姿估计不可靠、路面重建存在大量异常点、重建效率低下。这些限制影响了在自动驾驶等应用中的实用性。

Method: 1. 利用多相机系统固定空间关系增强位姿估计可靠性；2. 采用平面模型有效去除三角化路面的错误点；3. 将多相机集作为单一单元进行光束法平差以减少优化变量；4. 通过场景关联和组装模块实现多场景聚合。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上达到0.124的绝对位姿误差，表现出最先进的性能。在实际车辆部署中验证了MRASfM在各种场景下的泛化能力和在挑战性条件下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MRASfM框架专门针对驾驶场景的多相机系统进行了优化，通过创新的位姿估计、异常点去除和效率提升方法，显著提高了运动恢复结构在自动驾驶应用中的性能和实用性。

Abstract: Structure from Motion (SfM) estimates camera poses and reconstructs point
clouds, forming a foundation for various tasks. However, applying SfM to
driving scenes captured by multi-camera systems presents significant
difficulties, including unreliable pose estimation, excessive outliers in road
surface reconstruction, and low reconstruction efficiency. To address these
limitations, we propose a Multi-camera Reconstruction and Aggregation
Structure-from-Motion (MRASfM) framework specifically designed for driving
scenes. MRASfM enhances the reliability of camera pose estimation by leveraging
the fixed spatial relationships within the multi-camera system during the
registration process. To improve the quality of road surface reconstruction,
our framework employs a plane model to effectively remove erroneous points from
the triangulated road surface. Moreover, treating the multi-camera set as a
single unit in Bundle Adjustment (BA) helps reduce optimization variables to
boost efficiency. In addition, MRASfM achieves multi-scene aggregation through
scene association and assembly modules in a coarse-to-fine fashion. We deployed
multi-camera systems on actual vehicles to validate the generalizability of
MRASfM across various scenes and its robustness in challenging conditions
through real-world applications. Furthermore, large-scale validation results on
public datasets show the state-of-the-art performance of MRASfM, achieving
0.124 absolute pose error on the nuScenes dataset.

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial movements that reveal

a Combined Optical Flow (COF), integrating both phases to enhance feature

Abstract: 3D phenotyping of plants plays a crucial role for understanding plant growth,
yield prediction, and disease control. We present a pipeline capable of
generating high-quality 3D reconstructions of individual agricultural plants.
To acquire data, a small commercially available UAV captures images of a
selected plant. Apart from placing ArUco markers, the entire image acquisition
process is fully autonomous, controlled by a self-developed Android application
running on the drone's controller. The reconstruction task is particularly
challenging due to environmental wind and downwash of the UAV. Our proposed
pipeline supports the integration of arbitrary state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction methods. To mitigate errors caused by leaf motion during image
capture, we use an iterative method that gradually adjusts the input images
through deformation. Motion is estimated using optical flow between the
original input images and intermediate 3D reconstructions rendered from the
corresponding viewpoints. This alignment gradually reduces scene motion,
resulting in a canonical representation. After a few iterations, our pipeline
improves the reconstruction of state-of-the-art methods and enables the
extraction of high-resolution 3D meshes. We will publicly release the source
code of our reconstruction pipeline. Additionally, we provide a dataset
consisting of multiple plants from various crops, captured across different
points in time.

Result: 在多个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有最先进方法，以更少参数实现更优性能。

Conclusion: HiMA架构通过有效结合不同模块的优势，在低光RAW图像增强任务中实现了效率和质量的双重提升。

Abstract: Low-light RAW image enhancement remains a challenging task. Although numerous
deep learning based approaches have been proposed, they still suffer from
inherent limitations. A key challenge is how to simultaneously achieve strong
enhancement quality and high efficiency. In this paper, we rethink the
architecture for efficient low-light image signal processing (ISP) and
introduce a Hierarchical Mixing Architecture (HiMA). HiMA leverages the
complementary strengths of Transformer and Mamba modules to handle features at
large and small scales, respectively, thereby improving efficiency while
avoiding the ambiguities observed in prior two-stage frameworks. To further
address uneven illumination with strong local variations, we propose Local
Distribution Adjustment (LoDA), which adaptively aligns feature distributions
across different local regions. In addition, to fully exploit the denoised
outputs from the first stage, we design a Multi-prior Fusion (MPF) module that
integrates spatial and frequency-domain priors for detail enhancement.
Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior performance with
fewer parameters. Code will be released at https://github.com/Cynicarlos/HiMA.

*Heeseong Shin,Byeongho Heo,Dongyoon Han,Seungryong Kim,Taekyung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ORCA利用预训练文本到图像扩散模型获取任务自适应视觉表示用于机器人控制，通过可学习的任务提示和视觉提示来适应控制环境，无需微调模型本身。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉表示在模仿学习中通常是任务无关的，因为它们在学习策略时保持冻结状态。本文探索如何利用预训练文本到图像扩散模型获得任务自适应的视觉表示，而无需微调模型。

Method: 提出ORCA方法，引入可学习的任务提示来适应控制环境，以及视觉提示来捕捉细粒度的帧特定细节，通过新设计的条件促进任务自适应表示。

Result: 该方法在各种机器人控制基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，显著超越了先前的方法。

Conclusion: 通过考虑控制所需的特定动态视觉信息，ORCA成功地将预训练扩散模型应用于机器人控制任务，证明了任务自适应视觉表示的有效性。

Abstract: While pre-trained visual representations have significantly advanced
imitation learning, they are often task-agnostic as they remain frozen during
policy learning. In this work, we explore leveraging pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models to obtain task-adaptive visual representations for robotic
control, without fine-tuning the model itself. However, we find that naively
applying textual conditions - a successful strategy in other vision domains -
yields minimal or even negative gains in control tasks. We attribute this to
the domain gap between the diffusion model's training data and robotic control
environments, leading us to argue for conditions that consider the specific,
dynamic visual information required for control. To this end, we propose ORCA,
which introduces learnable task prompts that adapt to the control environment
and visual prompts that capture fine-grained, frame-specific details. Through
facilitating task-adaptive representations with our newly devised conditions,
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on various robotic control
benchmarks, significantly surpassing prior methods.

*Ignacio Serna*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Latent Feature Alignment (LFA)方法，无需属性标签即可识别人脸识别模型中的偏见子群体，通过潜在方向发现可解释的语义属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代人脸识别模型存在系统性偏见，但传统偏见评估框架依赖昂贵的人工标注属性，且局限于预定义类别。

Method: 使用潜在方向识别子群体的无属性标签算法，相比标准聚类能产生语义更一致的分组和可解释的方向。

Result: 在四个先进识别模型和两个基准测试上，LFA在组内语义一致性方面持续优于k-means和最近邻搜索，并能发现与人口统计和上下文属性对齐的可解释潜在方向。

Conclusion: LFA可作为人脸识别模型表示审计的实用方法，使从业者无需预定义属性标注即可识别和解释偏见子群体。

Abstract: Modern face recognition models achieve high overall accuracy but continue to
exhibit systematic biases that disproportionately affect certain
subpopulations. Conventional bias evaluation frameworks rely on labeled
attributes to form subpopulations, which are expensive to obtain and limited to
predefined categories. We introduce Latent Feature Alignment (LFA), an
attribute-label-free algorithm that uses latent directions to identify
subpopulations. This yields two main benefits over standard clustering: (i)
semantically coherent grouping, where faces sharing common attributes are
grouped together more reliably than by proximity-based methods, and (ii)
discovery of interpretable directions, which correspond to semantic attributes
such as age, ethnicity, or attire. Across four state-of-the-art recognition
models (ArcFace, CosFace, ElasticFace, PartialFC) and two benchmarks (RFW,
CelebA), LFA consistently outperforms k-means and nearest-neighbor search in
intra-group semantic coherence, while uncovering interpretable latent
directions aligned with demographic and contextual attributes. These results
position LFA as a practical method for representation auditing of face
recognition models, enabling practitioners to identify and interpret biased
subpopulations without predefined attribute annotations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于卫星土地利用分类的自定义卷积神经网络架构，在EuroSAT数据集上达到97.23%的测试准确率，无需预训练模型。主要贡献是平衡多任务注意力机制，结合空间和光谱特征提取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决卫星图像分类中的特定失败模式，探索无需预训练模型的高效架构设计，特别关注空间和光谱特征的平衡利用。

Method: 通过三个渐进架构迭代：基线架构、CBAM增强架构、平衡多任务注意力架构。使用Coordinate Attention提取空间特征，Squeeze-Excitation块提取光谱特征，通过可学习融合参数统一。采用渐进DropBlock正则化和类别平衡损失加权。

Result: 最终12层架构达到97.23%测试准确率，Cohen's Kappa为0.9692，所有类别准确率超过94.46%。可学习参数自动收敛到alpha≈0.57，表明空间和光谱模态重要性接近相等。

Conclusion: 系统化的架构设计在领域特定应用中非常有效，该方法性能接近微调ResNet-50（仅差1.34%），且无需外部数据，验证了定制化设计的优势。

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation of custom convolutional neural
network architectures for satellite land use classification, achieving 97.23%
test accuracy on the EuroSAT dataset without reliance on pre-trained models.
Through three progressive architectural iterations (baseline: 94.30%,
CBAM-enhanced: 95.98%, and balanced multi-task attention: 97.23%) we identify
and address specific failure modes in satellite imagery classification. Our
principal contribution is a novel balanced multi-task attention mechanism that
combines Coordinate Attention for spatial feature extraction with
Squeeze-Excitation blocks for spectral feature extraction, unified through a
learnable fusion parameter. Experimental results demonstrate that this
learnable parameter autonomously converges to alpha approximately 0.57,
indicating near-equal importance of spatial and spectral modalities for
satellite imagery. We employ progressive DropBlock regularization (5-20% by
network depth) and class-balanced loss weighting to address overfitting and
confusion pattern imbalance. The final 12-layer architecture achieves Cohen's
Kappa of 0.9692 with all classes exceeding 94.46% accuracy, demonstrating
confidence calibration with a 24.25% gap between correct and incorrect
predictions. Our approach achieves performance within 1.34% of fine-tuned
ResNet-50 (98.57%) while requiring no external data, validating the efficacy of
systematic architectural design for domain-specific applications. Complete
code, trained models, and evaluation scripts are publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SiM2P是一个基于3D扩散桥的框架，能够从MRI和患者辅助信息生成诊断质量的FDG-PET图像，显著提高了痴呆症诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FDG-PET在痴呆症诊断中很有价值，但相比常规MRI更昂贵且不易获取，限制了其在资源有限环境中的应用。

Method: 使用3D扩散桥框架学习从MRI和患者信息到FDG-PET图像的映射，只需20个站点特定病例和基本人口统计信息即可部署。

Result: 在盲法临床研究中，SiM2P将三组（阿尔茨海默病、行为变异型额颞叶痴呆、认知健康对照）的总体诊断准确率从75.0%提高到84.7%，并获得更高的诊断确定性评分和更好的评估者间一致性。

Conclusion: SiM2P使FDG-PET的诊断优势更易获得，有望改善资源有限环境下痴呆症的早期检测和鉴别诊断。

Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is an
established tool in the diagnostic workup of patients with suspected dementing
disorders. However, compared to the routinely available magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), FDG-PET remains significantly less accessible and substantially
more expensive. Here, we present SiM2P, a 3D diffusion bridge-based framework
that learns a probabilistic mapping from MRI and auxiliary patient information
to simulate FDG-PET images of diagnostic quality. In a blinded clinical reader
study, two neuroradiologists and two nuclear medicine physicians rated the
original MRI and SiM2P-simulated PET images of patients with Alzheimer's
disease, behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia, and cognitively healthy
controls. SiM2P significantly improved the overall diagnostic accuracy of
differentiating between three groups from 75.0% to 84.7% (p<0.05). Notably, the
simulated PET images received higher diagnostic certainty ratings and achieved
superior interrater agreement compared to the MRI images. Finally, we developed
a practical workflow for local deployment of the SiM2P framework. It requires
as few as 20 site-specific cases and only basic demographic information. This
approach makes the established diagnostic benefits of FDG-PET imaging more
accessible to patients with suspected dementing disorders, potentially
improving early detection and differential diagnosis in resource-limited
settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yiiitong/SiM2P.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决历史文档分析中结构化内容在退化、非标准形式下出现的挑战，包括运动模糊、手写变异、曝光波动和杂乱背景等问题。

Method: 从127个二战时期档案视频片段中提取包含拍板的生产元数据，提供完整帧标注和裁剪单词图像，使用旋转边界框作为4点多边形进行空间精确OCR标注。

Result: 在零样本和微调条件下对6个识别模型和7个检测模型进行基准测试，尽管训练集较小（18个视频），微调仍能带来显著的性能提升，适合少样本学习场景。

Conclusion: ClapperText为低资源档案环境中的鲁棒OCR和文档理解提供了一个现实且文化相关的资源，数据集和评估代码已公开。

Abstract: This paper presents ClapperText, a benchmark dataset for handwritten and
printed text recognition in visually degraded and low-resource settings. The
dataset is derived from 127 World War II-era archival video segments containing
clapperboards that record structured production metadata such as date,
location, and camera-operator identity. ClapperText includes 9,813 annotated
frames and 94,573 word-level text instances, 67% of which are handwritten and
1,566 are partially occluded. Each instance includes transcription, semantic
category, text type, and occlusion status, with annotations available as
rotated bounding boxes represented as 4-point polygons to support spatially
precise OCR applications. Recognizing clapperboard text poses significant
challenges, including motion blur, handwriting variation, exposure
fluctuations, and cluttered backgrounds, mirroring broader challenges in
historical document analysis where structured content appears in degraded,
non-standard forms. We provide both full-frame annotations and cropped word
images to support downstream tasks. Using a consistent per-video evaluation
protocol, we benchmark six representative recognition and seven detection
models under zero-shot and fine-tuned conditions. Despite the small training
set (18 videos), fine-tuning leads to substantial performance gains,
highlighting ClapperText's suitability for few-shot learning scenarios. The
dataset offers a realistic and culturally grounded resource for advancing
robust OCR and document understanding in low-resource archival contexts. The
dataset and evaluation code are available at

Abstract: We introduce Shakti VLM, a family of vision-language models in the capacity
of 1B and 4B parameters designed to address data efficiency challenges in
multimodal learning. While recent VLMs achieve strong performance through
extensive training data, Shakti models leverage architectural innovations to
attain competitive results with fewer tokens. Key advancements include
QK-Normalization for attention stability, hybrid normalization techniques, and
enhanced positional encoding. A three-stage training strategy further optimizes
learning efficiency. Evaluations show that Shakti-Shakti-VLM-1B and
Shakti-VLM-4B excel in document understanding, Visual Reasoning, OCR
extraction, and general multimodal reasoning. Our results highlight that high
performance can be achieved through model design and training strategy rather
than sheer data volume, making Shakti an efficient solution for
enterprise-scale multimodal tasks.

Conclusion: 提出的视觉引导3D布局生成系统能够有效解决现有方法的局限性，生成艺术性和连贯性强的3D场景布局。

Abstract: Generating artistic and coherent 3D scene layouts is crucial in digital
content creation. Traditional optimization-based methods are often constrained
by cumbersome manual rules, while deep generative models face challenges in
producing content with richness and diversity. Furthermore, approaches that
utilize large language models frequently lack robustness and fail to accurately
capture complex spatial relationships. To address these challenges, this paper
presents a novel vision-guided 3D layout generation system. We first construct
a high-quality asset library containing 2,037 scene assets and 147 3D scene
layouts. Subsequently, we employ an image generation model to expand prompt
representations into images, fine-tuning it to align with our asset library. We
then develop a robust image parsing module to recover the 3D layout of scenes
based on visual semantics and geometric information. Finally, we optimize the
scene layout using scene graphs and overall visual semantics to ensure logical
coherence and alignment with the images. Extensive user testing demonstrates
that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of
layout richness and quality. The code and dataset will be available at

Result: 在具有挑战性的数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法优于传统的单视角方法。

Conclusion: 通过融合多个编码器的特征，该模型在检测操纵图像方面实现了优越的性能，即使在具有挑战性的姿态和光照条件下也是如此。

Abstract: DeepFake technology has advanced significantly in recent years, enabling the
creation of highly realistic synthetic face images. Existing DeepFake detection
methods often struggle with pose variations, occlusions, and artifacts that are
difficult to detect in real-world conditions. To address these challenges, we
propose a multi-view architecture that enhances DeepFake detection by analyzing
facial features at multiple levels. Our approach integrates three specialized
encoders, a global view encoder for detecting boundary inconsistencies, a
middle view encoder for analyzing texture and color alignment, and a local view
encoder for capturing distortions in expressive facial regions such as the
eyes, nose, and mouth, where DeepFake artifacts frequently occur. Additionally,
we incorporate a face orientation encoder, trained to classify face poses,
ensuring robust detection across various viewing angles. By fusing features
from these encoders, our model achieves superior performance in detecting
manipulated images, even under challenging pose and lighting
conditions.Experimental results on challenging datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, outperforming conventional single-view approaches

Conclusion: 该模型成为验证显微镜工作流中实验准确性和图像保真度的实用工具。

Abstract: Lightweight deep learning models offer substantial reductions in
computational cost and environmental impact, making them crucial for scientific
applications. We present a lightweight CycleGAN for modality transfer in
fluorescence microscopy (confocal to super-resolution STED/deconvolved STED),
addressing the common challenge of unpaired datasets. By replacing the
traditional channel-doubling strategy in the U-Net-based generator with a fixed
channel approach, we drastically reduce trainable parameters from 41.8 million
to approximately nine thousand, achieving superior performance with faster
training and lower memory usage. We also introduce the GAN as a diagnostic tool
for experimental and labeling quality. When trained on high-quality images, the
GAN learns the characteristics of optimal imaging; deviations between its
generated outputs and new experimental images can reveal issues such as
photobleaching, artifacts, or inaccurate labeling. This establishes the model
as a practical tool for validating experimental accuracy and image fidelity in
microscopy workflows.

Motivation: 时空图像融合方法通常需要不同传感器采集的具有匹配空间和光谱分辨率的图像集，为了促进STIF方法的应用，需要开发标准化方法。

Method: 比较了两种标准化方法：1）传统上采样方法；2）ABSIS锐化方法，该方法将精细分辨率图像序列的整体特征与特定粗分辨率图像的独特属性相结合。

Result: 两种方法都显著提高了USTFIP STIF方法的准确性，锐化方法将融合图像的光谱和空间准确性分别提高了49.46%和78.40%。

Conclusion: 提出的标准化方法特别是ABSIS锐化方法能有效提升时空图像融合的性能，为STIF方法的实际应用提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Image Fusion (STIF) methods usually require sets of images
with matching spatial and spectral resolutions captured by different sensors.
To facilitate the application of STIF methods, we propose and compare two
different standardization approaches. The first method is based on traditional
upscaling of the fine-resolution images. The second method is a sharpening
approach called Anomaly Based Satellite Image Standardization (ABSIS) that
blends the overall features found in the fine-resolution image series with the
distinctive attributes of a specific coarse-resolution image to produce images
that more closely resemble the outcome of aggregating the fine-resolution
images. Both methods produce a significant increase in accuracy of the Unpaired
Spatio Temporal Fusion of Image Patches (USTFIP) STIF method, with the
sharpening approach increasing the spectral and spatial accuracies of the fused
images by up to 49.46\% and 78.40\%, respectively.

Abstract: Multimodal person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match pedestrian images
across different modalities. However, most existing methods focus on limited
cross-modal settings and fail to support arbitrary query-retrieval
combinations, hindering practical deployment. We propose FlexiReID, a flexible
framework that supports seven retrieval modes across four modalities: rgb,

mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanism to dynamically integrate diverse modality
features and a cross-modal query fusion module to enhance multimodal feature
extraction. To facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we construct CIRS-PEDES, a
unified dataset extending four popular Re-ID datasets to include all four
modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlexiReID achieves
state-of-the-art performance and offers strong generalization in complex

Conclusion: QFCA方法在保持高精度的同时实现了实时性能，为实际部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly localization is a rising field in computer vision research,
with important progress in recent years. This work focuses on the problem of
detecting and localizing anomalies in textures, where anomalies can be defined
as the regions that deviate from the overall statistics, violating the
stationarity assumption. The main limitation of existing methods is their high
running time, making them impractical for deployment in real-world scenarios,
such as assembly line monitoring. We propose a real-time method, named QFCA,
which implements a quantized version of the feature correspondence analysis
(FCA) algorithm. By carefully adapting the patch statistics comparison to work
on histograms of quantized values, we obtain a 10x speedup with little to no
loss in accuracy. Moreover, we introduce a feature preprocessing step based on
principal component analysis, which enhances the contrast between normal and
anomalous features, improving the detection precision on complex textures. Our
method is thoroughly evaluated against prior art, comparing favorably with
existing methods. Project page:

Motivation: 当前自监督去噪技术在真实世界应用中受到计算和内存需求的限制，需要在推理速度与重建质量之间做出妥协。

Method: 基于Noise2Noise训练框架，引入创新的多阶段去噪流程Noise2Detail，在推理过程中破坏噪声模式的空间相关性产生中间平滑结构，然后从噪声输入中重新捕捉精细细节。

Conclusion: 该方法的效率、低计算成本和无数据特性使其成为生物医学成像的有价值工具，克服了清洁训练数据稀缺的挑战，同时实现快速推理以供实际使用。

Abstract: Current self-supervised denoising techniques achieve impressive results, yet
their real-world application is frequently constrained by substantial
computational and memory demands, necessitating a compromise between inference
speed and reconstruction quality. In this paper, we present an
ultra-lightweight model that addresses this challenge, achieving both fast
denoising and high quality image restoration. Built upon the Noise2Noise
training framework-which removes the reliance on clean reference images or
explicit noise modeling-we introduce an innovative multistage denoising
pipeline named Noise2Detail (N2D). During inference, this approach disrupts the
spatial correlations of noise patterns to produce intermediate smooth
structures, which are subsequently refined to recapture fine details directly
from the noisy input. Extensive testing reveals that Noise2Detail surpasses
existing dataset-free techniques in performance, while requiring only a
fraction of the computational resources. This combination of efficiency, low
computational cost, and data-free approach make it a valuable tool for
biomedical imaging, overcoming the challenges of scarce clean training data-due
to rare and complex imaging modalities-while enabling fast inference for
practical use.

Abstract: Domain adaptation is a crucial and increasingly important task in remote
sensing, aiming to transfer knowledge from a source domain a differently
distributed target domain. It has broad applications across various real-world
applications, including remote sensing element interpretation, ecological
environment monitoring, and urban/rural planning. However, domain adaptation in
remote sensing poses significant challenges due to differences in data, such as
variations in ground sampling distance, imaging modes from various sensors,
geographical landscapes, and environmental conditions. In recent years, deep
learning has emerged as a powerful tool for feature representation and
cross-domain knowledge transfer, leading to widespread adoption in remote
sensing tasks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of significant
advancements in deep learning based domain adaptation for remote sensing. We
first introduce the preliminary knowledge to clarify key concepts, mathematical
notations, and the taxonomy of methodologies. We then organize existing
algorithms from multiple perspectives, including task categorization, input
mode, supervision paradigm, and algorithmic granularity, providing readers with
a structured understanding of the field. Next, we review widely used datasets
and summarize the performance of state-of-the-art methods to provide an
overview of current progress. We also identify open challenges and potential
directions to guide future research in domain adaptation for remote sensing.
Compared to previous surveys, this work addresses a broader range of domain
adaptation tasks in remote sensing, rather than concentrating on a few
subfields. It also presents a systematic taxonomy, providing a more
comprehensive and organized understanding of the field. As a whole, this survey
can inspire the research community, foster understanding, and guide future work
in the field.

*Lei Shi,Gang Li,Junxing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种弱监督医学图像分割框架，仅需四个极值点标注，通过SAM2生成初始伪标签，结合改进的FGEPM算法和不确定性估计进行渐进式优化，在超声图像分割上达到与全监督方法相当甚至更优的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全监督医学图像分割需要大量像素级标注，成本高昂且耗时。为减轻标注负担，探索仅使用极值点标注的弱监督方法。

Method: 使用极值点生成边界框作为SAM2提示，产生初始伪标签；改进FGEPM算法，结合蒙特卡洛dropout不确定性估计构建梯度不确定性代价图进行边界追踪；引入双分支不确定性感知尺度一致性损失和边界框对齐损失确保空间一致性和精确边界对齐。

Result: 在BUSI和UNS两个公共超声数据集上的实验表明，该方法性能与全监督方法相当甚至更优，同时显著降低了标注成本。

Conclusion: 提出的弱监督框架在超声图像分割中具有有效性和实用性，为医学图像分析提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic medical image segmentation is a fundamental step in computer-aided
diagnosis, yet fully supervised approaches demand extensive pixel-level
annotations that are costly and time-consuming. To alleviate this burden, we
propose a weakly supervised segmentation framework that leverages only four
extreme points as annotation. Specifically, bounding boxes derived from the
extreme points are used as prompts for the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) to
generate reliable initial pseudo labels. These pseudo labels are progressively
refined by an enhanced Feature-Guided Extreme Point Masking (FGEPM) algorithm,
which incorporates Monte Carlo dropout-based uncertainty estimation to
construct a unified gradient uncertainty cost map for boundary tracing.
Furthermore, a dual-branch Uncertainty-aware Scale Consistency (USC) loss and a
box alignment loss are introduced to ensure spatial consistency and precise
boundary alignment during training. Extensive experiments on two public
ultrasound datasets, BUSI and UNS, demonstrate that our method achieves
performance comparable to, and even surpassing fully supervised counterparts
while significantly reducing annotation cost. These results validate the
effectiveness and practicality of the proposed weakly supervised framework for
ultrasound image segmentation.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel dataset aimed at detecting pedestrians'
intentions as they approach an ego-vehicle. The dataset comprises synchronized
multi-modal data, including fisheye camera feeds, lidar laser scans, ultrasonic
sensor readings, and motion capture-based 3D body poses, collected across
diverse real-world scenarios. Key contributions include detailed annotations of

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多模态视觉变换器自编码器(MViT-AE)的无监督异常检测方法，用于脑肿瘤分割，无需人工标注即可通过重建误差图检测和定位肿瘤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决脑磁共振成像中标注数据有限、成本高或不一致的问题，为神经影像工作流程提供可扩展的无监督解决方案。

Method: 使用仅在健康脑MRI上训练的多模态视觉变换器自编码器，结合多模态早期-晚期融合策略和集成Segment Anything Model的后处理流程来优化肿瘤轮廓。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) presents a complementary alternative to
supervised learning for brain tumor segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), particularly when annotated datasets are limited, costly, or
inconsistent. In this work, we propose a novel Multimodal Vision Transformer
Autoencoder (MViT-AE) trained exclusively on healthy brain MRIs to detect and
localize tumors via reconstruction-based error maps. This unsupervised paradigm
enables segmentation without reliance on manual labels, addressing a key
scalability bottleneck in neuroimaging workflows. Our method is evaluated in
the BraTS-GoAT 2025 Lighthouse dataset, which includes various types of tumors
such as gliomas, meningiomas, and pediatric brain tumors. To enhance
performance, we introduce a multimodal early-late fusion strategy that
leverages complementary information across multiple MRI sequences, and a
post-processing pipeline that integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to
refine predicted tumor contours. Despite the known challenges of UAD,
particularly in detecting small or non-enhancing lesions, our method achieves
clinically meaningful tumor localization, with lesion-wise Dice Similarity
Coefficient of 0.437 (Whole Tumor), 0.316 (Tumor Core), and 0.350 (Enhancing
Tumor) on the test set, and an anomaly Detection Rate of 89.4% on the
validation set. These findings highlight the potential of transformer-based
unsupervised models to serve as scalable, label-efficient tools for
neuro-oncological imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了UniMedVL，首个医学统一多模态模型，能在单一架构中同时处理图像理解和生成任务，解决了现有医学AI系统在数据表示、特征集成和多模态能力方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学AI系统破坏了统一诊断流程：图像理解模型只能解释图像不能生成视觉输出，而图像生成模型只能合成图像不能提供文本解释，导致数据表示、特征集成和任务级多模态能力存在差距。

Method: 通过观察-知识-分析(OKA)范式构建多级框架：观察级构建UniMed-5M数据集（560万样本）；知识级提出渐进式课程学习；分析级引入UniMedVL统一多模态模型。

Result: UniMedVL在5个医学图像理解基准测试中表现优异，在8种医学成像模态的生成质量上与专业模型相当，且统一架构实现了双向知识共享。

Conclusion: 将传统分离的能力集成在单一医学框架内，能在不同医学视觉语言任务中实现改进，生成任务能增强视觉理解特征。

Abstract: Medical diagnostic applications require models that can process multimodal
medical inputs (images, patient histories, lab results) and generate diverse
outputs including both textual reports and visual content (annotations,
segmentation masks, and images). Despite this need, existing medical AI systems
disrupt this unified process: medical image understanding models interpret
images but cannot generate visual outputs, while medical image generation
models synthesize images but cannot provide textual explanations. This leads to
gaps in data representation, feature integration, and task-level multimodal
capabilities. To this end, we propose a multi-level framework that draws
inspiration from diagnostic workflows through the
Observation-Knowledge-Analysis (OKA) paradigm. Specifically, at the observation
level, we construct UniMed-5M, a dataset comprising over 5.6M samples that
reformat diverse unimodal data into multimodal pairs for foundational
observation. At the knowledge level, we propose Progressive Curriculum Learning
that systematically introduces medical multimodal knowledge. At the analysis
level, we introduce UniMedVL, the first medical unified multimodal model for
the simultaneous analysis of image understanding and generation tasks within a
single architecture. UniMedVL achieves superior performance on five medical
image understanding benchmarks, while matching specialized models in generation
quality across eight medical imaging modalities. Crucially, our unified
architecture enables bidirectional knowledge sharing: generation tasks enhance
visual understanding features, demonstrating that integrating traditionally
separate capabilities within a single medical framework unlocks improvements
across diverse medical vision-language tasks. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了DGME-T方法，通过在Video Swin Transformer中注入方向性网格运动编码，显著提升了历史档案影片的相机运动分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有相机运动分类模型在高质量现代视频上表现良好，但在噪声、帧缺失、低对比度的历史档案影片上性能下降严重。

Method: 构建统一基准数据集，并在Video Swin Transformer基础上引入基于光流的方向性网格运动编码，通过可学习的归一化后期融合层进行集成。

Result: DGME-T将现代视频的top-1准确率从81.78%提升到86.14%，宏观F1从82.08%提升到87.81%；在二战历史影片上准确率从83.43%提升到84.62%，宏观F1从81.72%提升到82.63%。

Conclusion: 结构化运动先验与transformer表示具有互补性，即使小规模精心校准的运动头也能显著增强退化影片分析的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Camera movement classification (CMC) models trained on contemporary,
high-quality footage often degrade when applied to archival film, where noise,
missing frames, and low contrast obscure motion cues. We bridge this gap by
assembling a unified benchmark that consolidates two modern corpora into four
canonical classes and restructures the HISTORIAN collection into five balanced
categories. Building on this benchmark, we introduce DGME-T, a lightweight
extension to the Video Swin Transformer that injects directional grid motion
encoding, derived from optical flow, via a learnable and normalised late-fusion
layer. DGME-T raises the backbone's top-1 accuracy from 81.78% to 86.14% and
its macro F1 from 82.08% to 87.81% on modern clips, while still improving the
demanding World-War-II footage from 83.43% to 84.62% accuracy and from 81.72%
to 82.63% macro F1. A cross-domain study further shows that an intermediate
fine-tuning stage on modern data increases historical performance by more than
five percentage points. These results demonstrate that structured motion priors
and transformer representations are complementary and that even a small,
carefully calibrated motion head can substantially enhance robustness in
degraded film analysis. Related resources are available at

Motivation: 指令视频编辑因缺乏大规模高质量训练数据而发展受限，需要解决数据稀缺的根本挑战。

Method: 提出Ditto框架：1）融合图像编辑器和上下文视频生成器的数据生成管道；2）采用高效蒸馏模型架构和时序增强器降低成本并提升时序一致性；3）智能代理驱动整个流程，确保质量控制。

Conclusion: Ditto框架成功解决了指令视频编辑的数据稀缺问题，建立的Editto模型在该领域达到了新的最先进水平。

Abstract: Instruction-based video editing promises to democratize content creation, yet
its progress is severely hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality
training data. We introduce Ditto, a holistic framework designed to tackle this
fundamental challenge. At its heart, Ditto features a novel data generation
pipeline that fuses the creative diversity of a leading image editor with an
in-context video generator, overcoming the limited scope of existing models. To
make this process viable, our framework resolves the prohibitive cost-quality
trade-off by employing an efficient, distilled model architecture augmented by
a temporal enhancer, which simultaneously reduces computational overhead and
improves temporal coherence. Finally, to achieve full scalability, this entire
pipeline is driven by an intelligent agent that crafts diverse instructions and
rigorously filters the output, ensuring quality control at scale. Using this
framework, we invested over 12,000 GPU-days to build Ditto-1M, a new dataset of
one million high-fidelity video editing examples. We trained our model, Editto,
on Ditto-1M with a curriculum learning strategy. The results demonstrate
superior instruction-following ability and establish a new state-of-the-art in
instruction-based video editing.

TL;DR: 提出SEGA方法，通过分层推理和从粗到精的策略解决内容感知布局生成问题，在多个基准数据集上达到最先进效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏反馈式自校正机制，在面对复杂元素布局规划时失败率显著增加

Method: 采用分层推理框架：粗粒度模块初步估计布局规划结果，精炼模块基于粗规划结果进行细粒度推理，并融入布局设计原则作为先验知识

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能

Conclusion: SEGA方法通过分层推理和从粗到精的策略有效解决了内容感知布局生成问题

Abstract: In this paper, we study the content-aware layout generation problem, which
aims to automatically generate layouts that are harmonious with a given
background image. Existing methods usually deal with this task with a
single-step reasoning framework. The lack of a feedback-based self-correction
mechanism leads to their failure rates significantly increasing when faced with
complex element layout planning. To address this challenge, we introduce SEGA,
a novel Stepwise Evolution Paradigm for Content-Aware Layout Generation.
Inspired by the systematic mode of human thinking, SEGA employs a hierarchical
reasoning framework with a coarse-to-fine strategy: first, a coarse-level
module roughly estimates the layout planning results; then, another refining
module performs fine-level reasoning regarding the coarse planning results.
Furthermore, we incorporate layout design principles as prior knowledge into
the model to enhance its layout planning ability. Besides, we present
GenPoster-100K that is a new large-scale poster dataset with rich
meta-information annotation. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach by achieving the state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmark
datasets. Our project page is at: https://brucew91.github.io/SEGA.github.io/

TL;DR: 提出了NDM框架，首个基于噪声的检测和缓解方法，用于识别和减轻文本到图像生成中的隐含恶意意图，同时保持模型生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检测方法主要针对显式色情内容，难以识别隐含的性暗示提示，而微调方法会降低生成质量。

Method: 利用早期预测噪声的可分离性开发噪声检测方法，并提出噪声增强的自适应负引导机制来优化初始噪声。

Result: 在自然和对抗数据集上的实验表明，NDM优于现有SOTA方法，包括SLD、UCE和RECE等。

Conclusion: NDM框架能有效检测和缓解隐含恶意意图，同时保持模型的原始生成能力。

Abstract: Despite the impressive generative capabilities of text-to-image (T2I)
diffusion models, they remain vulnerable to generating inappropriate content,
especially when confronted with implicit sexual prompts. Unlike explicit
harmful prompts, these subtle cues, often disguised as seemingly benign terms,
can unexpectedly trigger sexual content due to underlying model biases, raising
significant ethical concerns. However, existing detection methods are primarily
designed to identify explicit sexual content and therefore struggle to detect
these implicit cues. Fine-tuning approaches, while effective to some extent,
risk degrading the model's generative quality, creating an undesirable
trade-off. To address this, we propose NDM, the first noise-driven detection
and mitigation framework, which could detect and mitigate implicit malicious
intention in T2I generation while preserving the model's original generative
capabilities. Specifically, we introduce two key innovations: first, we
leverage the separability of early-stage predicted noise to develop a
noise-based detection method that could identify malicious content with high
accuracy and efficiency; second, we propose a noise-enhanced adaptive negative
guidance mechanism that could optimize the initial noise by suppressing the
prominent region's attention, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of adaptive
negative guidance for sexual mitigation. Experimentally, we validate NDM on
both natural and adversarial datasets, demonstrating its superior performance
over existing SOTA methods, including SLD, UCE, and RECE, etc. Code and
resources are available at https://github.com/lorraine021/NDM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当获取精细像素级标注困难或昂贵时，可以使用粗标注数据，但这类数据在边界对齐方面表现较差。

Method: 在编码器-解码器架构中引入基于超像素的上采样正则化，强制解码后的分割像素与SLIC超像素对齐。

Result: 在SUIM、Cityscapes和PanNuke数据集上评估，相比现有方法显著改善了边界召回率。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了在粗标注数据上训练的分割模型的边界对齐性能。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is the task of classifying each pixel in an image.
Training a segmentation model achieves best results using annotated images,
where each pixel is annotated with the corresponding class. When obtaining fine
annotations is difficult or expensive, it may be possible to acquire coarse
annotations, e.g. by roughly annotating pixels in an images leaving some pixels
around the boundaries between classes unlabeled. Segmentation with coarse
annotations is difficult, in particular when the objective is to optimize the
alignment of boundaries between classes. This paper proposes a regularization
method for models with an encoder-decoder architecture with superpixel based
upsampling. It encourages the segmented pixels in the decoded image to be
SLIC-superpixels, which are based on pixel color and position, independent of
the segmentation annotation. The method is applied to FCN-16 fully
convolutional network architecture and evaluated on the SUIM, Cityscapes, and
PanNuke data sets. It is shown that the boundary recall improves significantly
compared to state-of-the-art models when trained on coarse annotations.

OmniVinci, an initiative to build a strong, open-source, omni-modal LLM. We
carefully study the design choices across model architecture and data curation.
For model architecture, we present three key innovations: (i) OmniAlignNet for
strengthening alignment between vision and audio embeddings in a shared
omni-modal latent space; (ii) Temporal Embedding Grouping for capturing
relative temporal alignment between vision and audio signals; and (iii)
Constrained Rotary Time Embedding for encoding absolute temporal information in
omni-modal embeddings. We introduce a curation and synthesis pipeline that
generates 24M single-modal and omni-modal conversations. We find that
modalities reinforce one another in both perception and reasoning. Our model,
OmniVinci, outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni with +19.05 on DailyOmni (cross-modal
understanding), +1.7 on MMAR (audio), and +3.9 on Video-MME (vision), while
using just 0.2T training tokens - a 6 times reduction compared to
Qwen2.5-Omni's 1.2T. We finally demonstrate omni-modal advantages in downstream
applications spanning robotics, medical AI, and smart factory.

Motivation: 解决潜在扩散模型中高频细节保真度不足和罕见激活峰值的问题，提供无需训练或微调的稳定解决方案。

Method: 结合每样本微钳位技术（温和限制极端值）和自适应分位数裁剪（AQClip），AQClip可基于局部结构统计或注意力熵指导来调整允许值范围。

Result: 在CADE 2.5渲染管线中集成QSilk后，在低步数和高分辨率下获得更清晰、更锐利的结果，与CFG/Rescale技术有协同作用。

Conclusion: QSilk为潜在扩散模型提供了有效的稳定方案，在SD/SDXL骨干网络上均表现一致改进，且计算开销可忽略不计。

Abstract: We present QSilk, a lightweight, always-on stabilization layer for latent
diffusion that improves high-frequency fidelity while suppressing rare
activation spikes. QSilk combines (i) a per-sample micro clamp that gently
limits extreme values without washing out texture, and (ii) Adaptive Quantile
Clip (AQClip), which adapts the allowed value corridor per region. AQClip can
operate in a proxy mode using local structure statistics or in an attention
entropy guided mode (model confidence). Integrated into the CADE 2.5 rendering
pipeline, QSilk yields cleaner, sharper results at low step counts and
ultra-high resolutions with negligible overhead. It requires no training or
fine-tuning and exposes minimal user controls. We report consistent qualitative
improvements across SD/SDXL backbones and show synergy with CFG/Rescale,
enabling slightly higher guidance without artifacts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念瓶颈模型存在输入到概念映射偏差和有限可控性问题，限制了实际价值，损害了基于概念方法的责任性。

Method: 引入滤波器分组损失和联合概念监督，无需区域标注即可自动将视觉特征分组为语义有意义的组件。

Result: 在三个不同数据集上的实验表明，LDCBM在概念准确率和分类准确率上均优于先前CBMs，在可解释性和分类性能方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 通过将概念建立在视觉证据基础上，该方法克服了先前模型的基本限制，增强了可解释AI的可靠性。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance interpretability by predicting
human-understandable concepts as intermediate representations. However,
existing CBMs often suffer from input-to-concept mapping bias and limited
controllability, which restricts their practical value, directly damage the
responsibility of strategy from concept-based methods. We propose a lightweight
Disentangled Concept Bottleneck Model (LDCBM) that automatically groups visual
features into semantically meaningful components without region annotation. By
introducing a filter grouping loss and joint concept supervision, our method
improves the alignment between visual patterns and concepts, enabling more
transparent and robust decision-making. Notably, Experiments on three diverse
datasets demonstrate that LDCBM achieves higher concept and class accuracy,
outperforming previous CBMs in both interpretability and classification
performance. By grounding concepts in visual evidence, our method overcomes a
fundamental limitation of prior models and enhances the reliability of
interpretable AI.

Method: ReCon在扩散采样过程中集成区域引导修正，使用预训练感知模型反馈修正错误区域；提出区域对齐交叉注意力机制，加强图像区域与文本提示的空间语义对齐。

Result: ReCon显著提高了生成数据的质量和可训练性，在各种数据集、骨干架构和数据规模下都实现了持续的性能提升。

Conclusion: ReCon框架通过区域引导修正和空间语义对齐，有效解决了生成模型在数据增强中的内容位置不匹配和语义泄漏问题，为训练鲁棒感知模型提供了高质量合成数据。

Abstract: The scale and quality of datasets are crucial for training robust perception
models. However, obtaining large-scale annotated data is both costly and
time-consuming. Generative models have emerged as a powerful tool for data
augmentation by synthesizing samples that adhere to desired distributions.
However, current generative approaches often rely on complex post-processing or
extensive fine-tuning on massive datasets to achieve satisfactory results, and
they remain prone to content-position mismatches and semantic leakage. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce ReCon, a novel augmentation framework
that enhances the capacity of structure-controllable generative models for
object detection. ReCon integrates region-guided rectification into the
diffusion sampling process, using feedback from a pre-trained perception model
to rectify misgenerated regions within diffusion sampling process. We further
propose region-aligned cross-attention to enforce spatial-semantic alignment
between image regions and their textual cues, thereby improving both semantic
consistency and overall image fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ReCon substantially improve the quality and trainability of generated data,
achieving consistent performance gains across various datasets, backbone
architectures, and data scales. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ERNet，一种高效的前馈模型，用于处理非刚性变形的点云序列配准，通过两阶段管道预测变形图序列，在精度和速度上均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非刚性变形点云序列配准中的两个关键挑战：局部极小值问题和长序列中的误差累积问题，特别是在噪声或部分输入的情况下。

Method: 采用可扩展的数据驱动方法，通过两阶段管道：首先估计帧级粗粒度图节点进行鲁棒初始化，然后在滑动窗口方式下随时间细化节点轨迹。

Result: 在DeformingThings4D和D-FAUST数据集上优于先前最先进方法，速度提升超过4倍，提供显著的效率改进。

Conclusion: ERNet能够有效处理噪声和部分输入，利用时间信息实现准确一致的序列配准，在精度和效率方面均表现出色。

Abstract: Registering an object shape to a sequence of point clouds undergoing
non-rigid deformation is a long-standing challenge. The key difficulties stem
from two factors: (i) the presence of local minima due to the non-convexity of
registration objectives, especially under noisy or partial inputs, which
hinders accurate and robust deformation estimation, and (ii) error accumulation
over long sequences, leading to tracking failures. To address these challenges,
we introduce to adopt a scalable data-driven approach and propose ERNet, an
efficient feed-forward model trained on large deformation datasets. It is
designed to handle noisy and partial inputs while effectively leveraging
temporal information for accurate and consistent sequential registration. The
key to our design is predicting a sequence of deformation graphs through a
two-stage pipeline, which first estimates frame-wise coarse graph nodes for
robust initialization, before refining their trajectories over time in a
sliding-window fashion. Extensive experiments show that our proposed approach
(i) outperforms previous state-of-the-art on both the DeformingThings4D and
D-FAUST datasets, and (ii) achieves more than 4x speedup compared to the
previous best, offering significant efficiency improvement.

TL;DR: VISTA是一个多代理系统，通过迭代循环自动改进视频生成质量，通过分解用户想法、选择最佳视频、专业代理批评和推理代理重写提示来实现持续优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频合成方法严重依赖精确的用户提示，而现有的测试时优化方法难以处理视频的多方面特性，需要一种能自主改进视频生成的系统。

Method: VISTA采用多代理系统：首先将用户想法分解为结构化时间计划，生成后通过成对锦标赛选择最佳视频，然后由专注于视觉、音频和上下文保真度的专业代理进行批评，最后由推理代理综合反馈并重写提示进行下一轮生成。

Result: 实验表明，VISTA在单场景和多场景视频生成中持续改进视频质量和用户意图对齐，相比最先进基线方法获得高达60%的成对胜率。人类评估者在66.4%的比较中更偏好VISTA输出。

Conclusion: VISTA通过迭代自我改进机制，能够一致地提高视频生成质量，解决了现有方法在视频优化方面的局限性，为文本到视频合成提供了有效的自主改进方案。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in text-to-video synthesis, generated video quality
remains critically dependent on precise user prompts. Existing test-time
optimization methods, successful in other domains, struggle with the
multi-faceted nature of video. In this work, we introduce VISTA (Video
Iterative Self-improvemenT Agent), a novel multi-agent system that autonomously
improves video generation through refining prompts in an iterative loop. VISTA
first decomposes a user idea into a structured temporal plan. After generation,
the best video is identified through a robust pairwise tournament. This winning
video is then critiqued by a trio of specialized agents focusing on visual,
audio, and contextual fidelity. Finally, a reasoning agent synthesizes this
feedback to introspectively rewrite and enhance the prompt for the next
generation cycle. Experiments on single- and multi-scene video generation
scenarios show that while prior methods yield inconsistent gains, VISTA
consistently improves video quality and alignment with user intent, achieving
up to 60% pairwise win rate against state-of-the-art baselines. Human
evaluators concur, preferring VISTA outputs in 66.4% of comparisons.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了RelateSeg方法，通过神经符号空间推理在开放词汇语义分割中引入一阶逻辑约束，解决现有方法缺乏空间关系理解的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉语言模型的方法在开放词汇语义分割中缺乏对物体空间关系的理解，导致分割结果不够准确。

Method: 使用神经符号方法，自动提取空间关系并编码为一阶逻辑公式，通过伪类别同时预测语义类别和空间关系，在深度网络中使用模糊逻辑松弛实现端到端学习。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上达到最先进的平均mIoU性能，特别在包含多个类别的图像上表现优异，仅引入一个辅助损失函数且无额外参数。

Conclusion: 验证了神经符号空间推理在开放词汇语义分割中的有效性，能够提高分割结果的准确性和一致性。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) assigns pixel-level labels from
an open set of categories, requiring generalization to unseen and unlabelled
objects. Using vision-language models (VLMs) to correlate local image patches
with potential unseen object categories suffers from a lack of understanding of
spatial relations of objects in a scene. To solve this problem, we introduce
neuro-symbolic (NeSy) spatial reasoning in OVSS. In contrast to contemporary
VLM correlation-based approaches, we propose Relational Segmentor (RelateSeg)
to impose explicit spatial relational constraints by first order logic (FOL)
formulated in a neural network architecture. This is the first attempt to
explore NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS. Specifically, RelateSeg automatically
extracts spatial relations, e.g., <cat, to-right-of, person>, and encodes them
as first-order logic formulas using our proposed pseudo categories. Each pixel
learns to predict both a semantic category (e.g., "cat") and a spatial pseudo
category (e.g., "right of person") simultaneously, enforcing relational
constraints (e.g., a "cat" pixel must lie to the right of a "person"). Finally,
these logic constraints are formulated in a deep network architecture by fuzzy
logic relaxation, enabling end-to-end learning of spatial-relationally
consistent segmentation. RelateSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance in
terms of average mIoU across four benchmark datasets and particularly shows
clear advantages on images containing multiple categories, with the cost of
only introducing a single auxiliary loss function and no additional parameters,
validating the effectiveness of NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS.

TL;DR: 3DPR是一个基于图像的重新照明模型，利用从光舞台捕获的多视图单光源图像学习的生成先验，实现高质量的人脸重新照明渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从单张肖像图像渲染新颖的重新照明视图是一个欠约束问题，传统图形学方法受限于底层模型的假设和近似。需要利用生成先验来克服这些限制。

Method: 首先将输入肖像嵌入预训练生成头部模型的潜在空间，然后使用在光舞台数据上训练的新型三平面反射网络合成高质量单光源图像，实现基于图像的重新照明。

Result: 3DPR在定量和定性评估中优于先前方法，特别是在保持身份和捕捉高光、自阴影、次表面散射等光照效果方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 通过结合生成头部模型的几何先验和光舞台数据的反射先验，3DPR能够实现物理准确的环境重新照明，显著提升了单张肖像重新照明的质量。

Abstract: Rendering novel, relit views of a human head, given a monocular portrait
image as input, is an inherently underconstrained problem. The traditional
graphics solution is to explicitly decompose the input image into geometry,
material and lighting via differentiable rendering; but this is constrained by
the multiple assumptions and approximations of the underlying models and
parameterizations of these scene components. We propose 3DPR, an image-based
relighting model that leverages generative priors learnt from multi-view
One-Light-at-A-Time (OLAT) images captured in a light stage. We introduce a new
diverse and large-scale multi-view 4K OLAT dataset of 139 subjects to learn a
high-quality prior over the distribution of high-frequency face reflectance. We
leverage the latent space of a pre-trained generative head model that provides
a rich prior over face geometry learnt from in-the-wild image datasets. The
input portrait is first embedded in the latent manifold of such a model through
an encoder-based inversion process. Then a novel triplane-based reflectance
network trained on our lightstage data is used to synthesize high-fidelity OLAT
images to enable image-based relighting. Our reflectance network operates in
the latent space of the generative head model, crucially enabling a relatively
small number of lightstage images to train the reflectance model. Combining the
generated OLATs according to a given HDRI environment maps yields physically
accurate environmental relighting results. Through quantitative and qualitative
evaluations, we demonstrate that 3DPR outperforms previous methods,
particularly in preserving identity and in capturing lighting effects such as
specularities, self-shadows, and subsurface scattering. Project Page:

TL;DR: Memory-SAM是一个无需训练、无需人工提示的舌象分割方法，通过检索历史案例自动生成有效提示来指导SAM2模型，在真实世界条件下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督模型需要大量标注数据，而SAM系列模型仍需人工提示。本文旨在开发一种无需训练和人工干预的自动舌象分割方法。

Method: 使用DINOv3特征和FAISS检索构建小型记忆库，通过掩码约束对应关系提取前景/背景点提示，自动指导SAM2进行分割。

Result: 在600张专家标注图像上测试，混合测试集的mIoU达到0.9863，显著优于FCN(0.8188)和检测器到框SAM基线(0.1839)。

Conclusion: 检索到提示的方法能够实现数据高效、鲁棒的舌象不规则边界分割，在真实世界条件下表现突出。

Abstract: Accurate tongue segmentation is crucial for reliable TCM analysis. Supervised
models require large annotated datasets, while SAM-family models remain
prompt-driven. We present Memory-SAM, a training-free, human-prompt-free
pipeline that automatically generates effective prompts from a small memory of
prior cases via dense DINOv3 features and FAISS retrieval. Given a query image,
mask-constrained correspondences to the retrieved exemplar are distilled into
foreground/background point prompts that guide SAM2 without manual clicks or
model fine-tuning. We evaluate on 600 expert-annotated images (300 controlled,
300 in-the-wild). On the mixed test split, Memory-SAM achieves mIoU 0.9863,
surpassing FCN (0.8188) and a detector-to-box SAM baseline (0.1839). On
controlled data, ceiling effects above 0.98 make small differences less
meaningful given annotation variability, while our method shows clear gains
under real-world conditions. Results indicate that retrieval-to-prompt enables
data-efficient, robust segmentation of irregular boundaries in tongue imaging.

Motivation: 推动原生图像生成的前沿发展，探索将文生图和图像编辑统一在单一架构中的可行性，并验证四个关键洞察对模型性能的影响。

Method: 采用自回归+扩散混合架构：自回归模型首先生成基于多模态输入的离散图像token，其隐藏状态作为扩散模型的调节信号来生成高保真图像。

Result: 在各项文生图和图像编辑基准测试中，BLIP3o-NEXT展现出优于现有模型的性能，实现了更高水平的连贯性和真实感。

Conclusion: 架构选择的关键在于可扩展性和推理速度；强化学习能推动性能边界；图像编辑仍是挑战但可通过后训练和数据引擎改善；数据质量和规模决定性能上限。

Abstract: We present BLIP3o-NEXT, a fully open-source foundation model in the BLIP3
series that advances the next frontier of native image generation. BLIP3o-NEXT
unifies text-to-image generation and image editing within a single
architecture, demonstrating strong image generation and image editing
capabilities. In developing the state-of-the-art native image generation model,
we identify four key insights: (1) Most architectural choices yield comparable
performance; an architecture can be deemed effective provided it scales
efficiently and supports fast inference; (2) The successful application of
reinforcement learning can further push the frontier of native image
generation; (3) Image editing still remains a challenging task, yet instruction
following and the consistency between generated and reference images can be
significantly enhanced through post-training and data engine; (4) Data quality
and scale continue to be decisive factors that determine the upper bound of
model performance. Building upon these insights, BLIP3o-NEXT leverages an
Autoregressive + Diffusion architecture in which an autoregressive model first
generates discrete image tokens conditioned on multimodal inputs, whose hidden
states are then used as conditioning signals for a diffusion model to generate
high-fidelity images. This architecture integrates the reasoning strength and
instruction following of autoregressive models with the fine-detail rendering
ability of diffusion models, achieving a new level of coherence and realism.
Extensive evaluations of various text-to-image and image-editing benchmarks
show that BLIP3o-NEXT achieves superior performance over existing models.

Abstract: Synthesizing large-scale, explorable, and geometrically accurate 3D urban
scenes is a challenging yet valuable task in providing immersive and embodied
applications. The challenges lie in the lack of large-scale and high-quality
real-world 3D scans for training generalizable generative models. In this
paper, we take an alternative route to create large-scale 3D scenes by
synergizing the readily available satellite imagery that supplies realistic
coarse geometry and the open-domain diffusion model for creating high-quality
close-up appearances. We propose \textbf{Skyfall-GS}, the first city-block
scale 3D scene creation framework without costly 3D annotations, also featuring
real-time, immersive 3D exploration. We tailor a curriculum-driven iterative
refinement strategy to progressively enhance geometric completeness and
photorealistic textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Skyfall-GS
provides improved cross-view consistent geometry and more realistic textures

TL;DR: 提出了三个新的多标签毒性检测基准，通过伪标签方法显著提升了毒性检测性能，超越了GPT-4o和DeepSeek等先进基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有毒性检测器主要依赖单标签基准，无法充分捕捉真实世界毒性提示的模糊性和多维度特性，导致有偏见的评估，包括漏检和误报，降低了检测器的可靠性。

Method: 基于公开毒性数据集构建了三个多标签基准(Q-A-MLL、R-A-MLL、H-X-MLL)，采用15类细粒度分类体系，并开发了基于伪标签的毒性检测方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著超越了GPT-4o和DeepSeek等先进基线模型，在多标签毒性检测方面实现了更准确可靠的评估。

Conclusion: 提出的多标签基准和伪标签方法能够更有效地评估LLM生成内容的多标签毒性，解决了单标签基准的局限性问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results across a range
of natural language processing tasks, but their potential to generate harmful
content has raised serious safety concerns. Current toxicity detectors
primarily rely on single-label benchmarks, which cannot adequately capture the
inherently ambiguous and multi-dimensional nature of real-world toxic prompts.
This limitation results in biased evaluations, including missed toxic
detections and false positives, undermining the reliability of existing
detectors. Additionally, gathering comprehensive multi-label annotations across
fine-grained toxicity categories is prohibitively costly, further hindering
effective evaluation and development. To tackle these issues, we introduce
three novel multi-label benchmarks for toxicity detection: \textbf{Q-A-MLL},
\textbf{R-A-MLL}, and \textbf{H-X-MLL}, derived from public toxicity datasets
and annotated according to a detailed 15-category taxonomy. We further provide
a theoretical proof that, on our released datasets, training with pseudo-labels
yields better performance than directly learning from single-label supervision.
In addition, we develop a pseudo-label-based toxicity detection method.
Extensive experimental results show that our approach significantly surpasses
advanced baselines, including GPT-4o and DeepSeek, thus enabling more accurate
and reliable evaluation of multi-label toxicity in LLM-generated content.

Motivation: 传统的对比学习训练的统一编码器容易学习模态捷径，导致在分布偏移下鲁棒性差。

Method: 使用偏好损失强制多模态嵌入优于单模态对应物，并通过组合正则化目标将多模态嵌入与其单模态部分组成的原型对齐。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法在分布外检索方面取得了提升。

Conclusion: 模态组合感知是使用MLLMs作为统一编码器时实现鲁棒组合多模态检索的有效原则。

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval, which seeks to retrieve relevant content across
modalities such as text or image, supports applications from AI search to
contents production. Despite the success of separate-encoder approaches like
CLIP align modality-specific embeddings with contrastive learning, recent
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable a unified encoder that directly
processes composed inputs. While flexible and advanced, we identify that
unified encoders trained with conventional contrastive learning are prone to
learn modality shortcut, leading to poor robustness under distribution shifts.
We propose a modality composition awareness framework to mitigate this issue.
Concretely, a preference loss enforces multimodal embeddings to outperform
their unimodal counterparts, while a composition regularization objective
aligns multimodal embeddings with prototypes composed from its unimodal parts.
These objectives explicitly model structural relationships between the composed
representation and its unimodal counterparts. Experiments on various benchmarks
show gains in out-of-distribution retrieval, highlighting modality composition
awareness as a effective principle for robust composed multimodal retrieval
when utilizing MLLMs as the unified encoder.

Motivation: 考虑到AI在处理习语方面的潜在局限性，研究旨在评估生成式AI模型在评估含习语和不含习语学生作文时的评分表现。

Method: 从348篇学生作文中创建两个相等的作文列表：一个包含多个习语，另一个不含习语。使用ChatGPT、Gemini和Deepseek三个生成式AI模型对两个列表中的所有作文进行三次评分，使用与人评分者相同的评分标准。

Result: 所有模型都显示出优秀的一致性，但Gemini在人评分者间信度方面优于竞争对手。对于包含多个习语的作文，Gemini的评分模式与人评分者最为相似。所有模型在评估中都没有检测到对任何人口群体的偏见。

Conclusion: 研究中的模型展示了混合方法的潜力，但Gemini由于处理比喻语言的能力而成为最佳候选，未来有望单独处理作文评分任务。

Abstract: The developments in Generative AI technologies have paved the way for
numerous innovations in different fields. Recently, Generative AI has been
proposed as a competitor to AES systems in evaluating student essays
automatically. Considering the potential limitations of AI in processing
idioms, this study assessed the scoring performances of Generative AI models
for essays with and without idioms by incorporating insights from Corpus
Linguistics and Computational Linguistics. Two equal essay lists were created
from 348 student essays taken from a corpus: one with multiple idioms present
in each essay and another with no idioms in essays. Three Generative AI models
(ChatGPT, Gemini, and Deepseek) were asked to score all essays in both lists
three times, using the same rubric used by human raters in assigning essay
scores. The results revealed excellent consistency for all models, but Gemini
outperformed its competitors in interrater reliability with human raters. There
was also no detectable bias for any demographic group in AI assessment. For
essays with multiple idioms, Gemini followed a the most similar pattern to
human raters. While the models in the study demonstrated potential for a hybrid
approach, Gemini was the best candidate for the task due to its ability to
handle figurative language and showed promise for handling essay-scoring tasks
alone in the future.

Abstract: Rhetorical strategies are central to persuasive communication, from political
discourse and marketing to legal argumentation. However, analysis of rhetorical
strategies has been limited by reliance on human annotation, which is costly,
inconsistent, difficult to scale. Their associated datasets are often limited
to specific topics and strategies, posing challenges for robust model
development. We propose a novel framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) to automatically generate and label synthetic debate data based on a
four-part rhetorical typology (causal, empirical, emotional, moral). We
fine-tune transformer-based classifiers on this LLM-labeled dataset and
validate its performance against human-labeled data on this dataset and on
multiple external corpora. Our model achieves high performance and strong
generalization across topical domains. We illustrate two applications with the
fine-tuned model: (1) the improvement in persuasiveness prediction from
incorporating rhetorical strategy labels, and (2) analyzing temporal and
partisan shifts in rhetorical strategies in U.S. Presidential debates
(1960-2020), revealing increased use of affective over cognitive argument in
U.S. Presidential debates.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出稀疏记忆微调方法，通过只更新被新知识高度激活的记忆槽来减少灾难性遗忘，在问答任务中相比全微调和LoRA显著降低了遗忘率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代语言模型部署后通常是静态的，持续学习面临灾难性遗忘的挑战。受可训练参数在所有任务间共享导致遗忘的启发，研究稀疏参数更新是否能实现无灾难性遗忘的学习。

Method: 引入稀疏记忆微调，利用记忆层模型的设计特性，只更新被新知识高度激活的记忆槽（相对于预训练数据使用情况），减少新知识与现有能力之间的干扰。

Result: 在两个问答任务上评估，稀疏记忆微调在学习新知识的同时遗忘显著减少：NaturalQuestions F1在全微调后下降89%，LoRA下降71%，而稀疏记忆微调仅下降11%，且达到相同的新知识获取水平。

Conclusion: 记忆层中的稀疏性为大语言模型的持续学习提供了一条有前景的路径。

Abstract: Modern language models are powerful, but typically static after deployment. A
major obstacle to building models that continually learn over time is
catastrophic forgetting, where updating on new data erases previously acquired
capabilities. Motivated by the intuition that mitigating forgetting is
challenging because trainable parameters are shared across all tasks, we
investigate whether sparse parameter updates can enable learning without
catastrophic forgetting. We introduce sparse memory finetuning, leveraging
memory layer models (Berges et al., 2024), which are sparsely updated by
design. By updating only the memory slots that are highly activated by a new
piece of knowledge relative to usage on pretraining data, we reduce
interference between new knowledge and the model's existing capabilities. We
evaluate learning and forgetting compared to full finetuning and
parameter-efficient finetuning with LoRA on two question answering tasks. We
find that sparse memory finetuning learns new knowledge while exhibiting
substantially less forgetting: while NaturalQuestions F1 drops by 89% after
full finetuning on new facts and 71% with LoRA, sparse memory finetuning yields
only an 11% drop with the same level of new knowledge acquisition. Our results
suggest sparsity in memory layers offers a promising path toward continual
learning in large language models.

*Kirill Semenov,Rico Sennrich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现MLAMA等多语言事实知识评估基准中的模板翻译存在语法和语义问题，通过使用Google Translate和ChatGPT进行句子级翻译后，知识检索分数显著提升，建议社区控制多语言数据集的语法正确性以获得更可解释的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLAMA等基准使用的模板翻译未考虑命名实体在句子中的语法和语义信息，导致最终提示存在语法错误或措辞不当，特别是对于形态丰富的语言，这影响了分数解释性。

Method: 从MLAMA数据集中选取4种斯拉夫语言，比较初始模板数据集与Google Translate和ChatGPT句子级翻译的知识检索分数，并对另外5种不同语系语言进行额外分析。

Result: 观察到知识检索分数显著增加，类似模式在其他语言中也存在，表明句子级翻译能有效提高语法正确性。

Conclusion: 建议社区控制高度多语言数据集的语法正确性，使用神经机器翻译或LLM系统进行整句翻译可获得更高且更可解释的结果。

Abstract: For multilingual factual knowledge assessment of LLMs, benchmarks such as
MLAMA use template translations that do not take into account the grammatical
and semantic information of the named entities inserted in the sentence. This
leads to numerous instances of ungrammaticality or wrong wording of the final
prompts, which complicates the interpretation of scores, especially for
languages that have a rich morphological inventory. In this work, we sample 4
Slavic languages from the MLAMA dataset and compare the knowledge retrieval
scores between the initial (templated) MLAMA dataset and its sentence-level
translations made by Google Translate and ChatGPT. We observe a significant
increase in knowledge retrieval scores, and provide a qualitative analysis for
possible reasons behind it. We also make an additional analysis of 5 more
languages from different families and see similar patterns. Therefore, we
encourage the community to control the grammaticality of highly multilingual
datasets for higher and more interpretable results, which is well approximated
by whole sentence translation with neural MT or LLM systems. The dataset and
all related code is published at the Github repository:

*Alexander Brady,Tunazzina Islam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个端到端的框架，通过无监督聚类和基于提示的标注，利用大语言模型自动从无标签语料库中生成可解释的主题分类法，并应用于2024年美国总统选举前的Meta政治广告分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体平台在塑造政治话语中发挥关键作用，但分析其庞大且快速演化的内容仍面临重大挑战。需要一种无需种子集或领域专业知识就能自动生成可解释主题分类的方法。

Method: 结合无监督聚类与基于提示的标注，利用大语言模型迭代构建分类法，并应用道德框架维度对主题进行注释。

Result: 发现投票和移民广告在总支出和展示量中占主导地位，而堕胎和选举诚信话题获得不成比例的覆盖范围。资金模式高度极化，不同议题的道德框架也存在差异。

Conclusion: 该框架支持对社交媒体政治信息进行可扩展、可解释的分析，帮助研究者、政策制定者和公众更好地理解新兴叙事、极化动态和数字政治沟通的道德基础。

Abstract: Social media platforms play a pivotal role in shaping political discourse,
but analyzing their vast and rapidly evolving content remains a major
challenge. We introduce an end-to-end framework for automatically generating an
interpretable topic taxonomy from an unlabeled corpus. By combining
unsupervised clustering with prompt-based labeling, our method leverages large
language models (LLMs) to iteratively construct a taxonomy without requiring
seed sets or domain expertise. We apply this framework to a large corpus of
Meta (previously known as Facebook) political ads from the month ahead of the
2024 U.S. Presidential election. Our approach uncovers latent discourse
structures, synthesizes semantically rich topic labels, and annotates topics
with moral framing dimensions. We show quantitative and qualitative analyses to
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Our findings reveal that voting
and immigration ads dominate overall spending and impressions, while abortion
and election-integrity achieve disproportionate reach. Funding patterns are
equally polarized: economic appeals are driven mainly by conservative PACs,
abortion messaging splits between pro- and anti-rights coalitions, and
crime-and-justice campaigns are fragmented across local committees. The framing
of these appeals also diverges--abortion ads emphasize liberty/oppression
rhetoric, while economic messaging blends care/harm, fairness/cheating, and
liberty/oppression narratives. Topic salience further reveals strong
correlations between moral foundations and issues. Demographic targeting also
emerges. This work supports scalable, interpretable analysis of political
messaging on social media, enabling researchers, policymakers, and the public
to better understand emerging narratives, polarization dynamics, and the moral
underpinnings of digital political communication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在波斯语等低资源语言中生成高质量的多选题仍然是一个重大挑战，需要开发专门的方法来应对这一需求。

Method: 结合候选生成、过滤和排序技术，利用Transformer和知识图谱等先进方法，并与基于规则的方法集成，以生成可信的干扰项。

Result: 开发了一个包含10,289个问题的波斯语MCQ数据集，并通过最先进的大型语言模型进行评估，证明了模型的有效性和生成数据集的质量。

Conclusion: FarsiMCQGen方法在波斯语多选题生成方面表现出色，所创建的数据集有望推动MCQ相关研究的进一步发展。

Abstract: Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) are commonly used in educational testing, as
they offer an efficient means of evaluating learners' knowledge. However,
generating high-quality MCQs, particularly in low-resource languages such as
Persian, remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces FarsiMCQGen, an
innovative approach for generating Persian-language MCQs. Our methodology
combines candidate generation, filtering, and ranking techniques to build a
model that generates answer choices resembling those in real MCQs. We leverage
advanced methods, including Transformers and knowledge graphs, integrated with
rule-based approaches to craft credible distractors that challenge test-takers.
Our work is based on data from Wikipedia, which includes general knowledge
questions. Furthermore, this study introduces a novel Persian MCQ dataset
comprising 10,289 questions. This dataset is evaluated by different
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our model and the quality of the generated dataset, which has
the potential to inspire further research on MCQs.

*Junlin Wu,Xianrui Zhong,Jiashuo Sun,Bolian Li,Bowen Jin,Jiawei Han,Qingkai Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Structure-R1框架，通过强化学习将检索内容转换为结构化表示，优化多步推理任务，在7B规模模型上实现与更大模型相当的竞争性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统处理非结构化文本导致信息密度低和推理效果不佳，需要更有效的结构化知识表示来增强LLM的推理能力。

Method: 使用强化学习学习内容表示策略，动态生成和调整结构格式；引入自奖励结构验证机制确保生成结构的正确性和自包含性。

Result: 在7个知识密集型基准测试中，7B规模模型实现竞争性性能，匹配更大模型的表现；理论分析显示结构化表示通过提高信息密度和上下文清晰度来增强推理。

Conclusion: Structure-R1框架通过生成任务特定的结构化表示，有效提升了LLM在知识密集型任务中的推理能力，证明了结构化表示对增强推理的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advances in
reasoning capabilities. However, their performance remains constrained by
limited access to explicit and structured domain knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) addresses this by incorporating external information as
context to augment reasoning. Nevertheless, traditional RAG systems typically
operate over unstructured and fragmented text, resulting in low information
density and suboptimal reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we propose
\textsc{Structure-R1}, a novel framework that transforms retrieved content into
structured representations optimized for reasoning. Leveraging reinforcement
learning, \textsc{Structure-R1} learns a content representation policy that
dynamically generates and adapts structural formats based on the demands of
multi-step reasoning. Unlike prior methods that rely on fixed schemas, our
approach adopts a generative paradigm capable of producing task-specific
structures tailored to individual queries. To ensure the quality and
reliability of these representations, we introduce a self-reward structural
verification mechanism that checks whether the generated structures are both
correct and self-contained. Extensive experiments on seven knowledge-intensive
benchmarks show that \textsc{Structure-R1} consistently achieves competitive
performance with a 7B-scale backbone model and matches the performance of much
larger models. Additionally, our theoretical analysis demonstrates how
structured representations enhance reasoning by improving information density
and contextual clarity. Our code and data are available at:

*Yuatyong Chaichana,Pittawat Taveekitworachai,Warit Sirichotedumrong,Potsawee Manakul,Kunat Pipatanakul*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Partial YaRN和VLAT两种方法，用于解决大型音频-语言模型在长音频理解中的上下文窗口限制问题，通过部分位置编码修改和虚拟长音频训练策略，显著提升了模型在长音频任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型音频-语言模型受限于短音频上下文窗口，即使其文本主干支持长上下文，这限制了长音频理解能力。现有上下文扩展方法主要针对单模态LLM，在LALMs中的应用尚未探索。

Method: 1. Partial YaRN：基于RoPE的无训练音频扩展方法，仅修改音频token位置，保持文本位置不变以保留基础LLM的文本能力；2. VLAT：将Partial YaRN扩展到训练时的位置增强策略，在训练中模拟不同音频长度，使模型能够泛化到远超训练时所见长度的输入。

Result: 在SALMONN和Qwen2-Audio上的实验表明，Partial YaRN在多种设置下优于原始模型，VLAT训练策略带来显著改进，在未见长度的长音频上实现了强大性能。

Conclusion: Partial YaRN和VLAT方法有效解决了LALMs的长音频理解限制，Partial YaRN作为无训练方法表现优异，VLAT进一步通过训练策略增强了模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are often constrained by short audio
context windows, even when their text backbones support long contexts, limiting
long-form audio understanding. Prior work has introduced context-extension
methods (e.g. YaRN) on unimodal LLMs, yet their application to LALMs remains
unexplored. First, building on RoPE-based context extension, we introduce
Partial YaRN, a training-free, audio-only extension method that modifies only
audio token positions, leaving text positions intact to preserve the base LLM's
text capabilities. Second, we propose Virtual Longform Audio Training (VLAT), a
training strategy that extends Partial YaRN into a training-time positional
augmentation. VLAT simulates diverse audio lengths during training, enabling
generalization to inputs far longer than those seen in training and improving
robustness for long-context audio understanding. Our experiments on SALMONN and
Qwen2-Audio show that Partial YaRN outperforms the original models across wide
range of settings, and VLAT training strategy provides substantial improvement,
achieving strong performance on long audio of unseen lengths.

*Lina Berrayana,Ahmed Heakl,Muhammad Abdullah Sohail,Thomas Hofmann,Salman Khan,Wei Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探索了离散扩散语言模型(DDLM)与自回归语言模型(ARM)的混合架构，发现在潜在空间中进行模型间通信比文本空间能显著提升准确性，同时大幅减少计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语言模型虽然准确率高但需要长序列生成，计算成本高；离散扩散模型支持并行生成且在复杂推理任务中表现优异。研究旨在探索两种模型协作是否能获得互补优势。

Method: 首先在文本空间中探索协作（一个模型规划推理过程，另一个基于规划执行答案），然后扩展到潜在空间通信，引入学习投影器将DDLM潜在表示映射到ARM嵌入空间。

Result: 从文本空间转向潜在空间的DDLM→ARM通信带来显著准确率提升：DART-5从27.0%提升至54.0%，AIME24从0.0%提升至14.0%。混合架构在保持准确性的同时大幅节省计算，潜在空间管道仅用64个规划token和约5个执行token就超越了使用44倍token的Qwen3.1-7B。

Conclusion: DDLM与ARM的混合架构为推理提供了新见解，特别是在潜在空间中的协作能显著提升性能并降低计算成本，展示了DDLM在混合架构中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Current autoregressive language models (ARMs) achieve high accuracy but
require long token sequences, making them costly. Discrete diffusion language
models (DDLMs) enable parallel and flexible generation within a fixed number of
steps and have recently emerged for their strong performance in complex
reasoning and long-term planning tasks. We present a study exploring hybrid
architectures that couple DDLMs with ARMs to assess whether their collaboration
can yield complementary benefits. We first examine collaboration in text space,
where one model plans the reasoning process and another executes the final
answer based on that plan. We then extend this setup to latent-space
communication, introducing a learned projector that maps DDLM latents into the
ARM's embedding space, potentially bypassing some of the text-generation
limitations of diffusion models. We find that shifting DDLM --> ARM
communication from text space to latent space yields significant accuracy
gains, for example increasing from 27.0% to 54.0% on DART-5 and from 0.0% to
14.0% on AIME24. We also find that combining a DDLM planner with an ARM
executor can provide substantial computational savings with little to no impact
on accuracy. For example, the latent-space pipeline, using 64 tokens for
planning and roughly 5 for execution, surpasses Qwen3.1-7B on DART-5 and AIME,
despite Qwen using 44 times more tokens. Overall, our study offers new insights
into reasoning with DDLMs and highlights their potential in hybrid
architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文档理解方法存在局限性：OCR+LLM流水线会丢失结构细节，而原生多模态LLM在上下文建模方面存在困难。多模态RAG能够实现跨所有模态的整体检索和推理，解锁全面的文档智能。

Method: 提出了基于领域、检索模态和粒度的分类法，回顾了涉及图结构和代理框架的进展，总结了关键数据集、基准和应用。

Result: 系统梳理了多模态RAG在文档理解领域的研究现状，建立了分类框架，并识别了当前技术发展的关键方向。

Conclusion: 多模态RAG是文档AI的重要发展方向，但仍面临效率、细粒度表示和鲁棒性等挑战，需要未来研究重点关注。

Abstract: Document understanding is critical for applications from financial analysis
to scientific discovery. Current approaches, whether OCR-based pipelines
feeding Large Language Models (LLMs) or native Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), face
key limitations: the former loses structural detail, while the latter struggles
with context modeling. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps ground models
in external data, but documents' multimodal nature, i.e., combining text,
tables, charts, and layout, demands a more advanced paradigm: Multimodal RAG.
This approach enables holistic retrieval and reasoning across all modalities,
unlocking comprehensive document intelligence. Recognizing its importance, this
paper presents a systematic survey of Multimodal RAG for document
understanding. We propose a taxonomy based on domain, retrieval modality, and
granularity, and review advances involving graph structures and agentic
frameworks. We also summarize key datasets, benchmarks, and applications, and
highlight open challenges in efficiency, fine-grained representation, and
robustness, providing a roadmap for future progress in document AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有ICD编码方法面临的语义鸿沟、罕见和长尾代码性能差、可解释性有限等问题。

Method: 提出TraceCoder框架，动态整合多源外部知识，引入混合注意力机制建模标签、临床上下文和知识之间的交互。

Conclusion: TraceCoder为自动化ICD编码提供了可扩展且稳健的解决方案，满足临床对准确性、可解释性和可靠性的需求。

Abstract: Automated International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding assigns
standardized diagnosis and procedure codes to clinical records, playing a
critical role in healthcare systems. However, existing methods face challenges
such as semantic gaps between clinical text and ICD codes, poor performance on
rare and long-tail codes, and limited interpretability. To address these
issues, we propose TraceCoder, a novel framework integrating multi-source
external knowledge to enhance traceability and explainability in ICD coding.
TraceCoder dynamically incorporates diverse knowledge sources, including UMLS,
Wikipedia, and large language models (LLMs), to enrich code representations,
bridge semantic gaps, and handle rare and ambiguous codes. It also introduces a
hybrid attention mechanism to model interactions among labels, clinical
context, and knowledge, improving long-tail code recognition and making
predictions interpretable by grounding them in external evidence. Experiments
on MIMIC-III-ICD9, MIMIC-IV-ICD9, and MIMIC-IV-ICD10 datasets demonstrate that
TraceCoder achieves state-of-the-art performance, with ablation studies
validating the effectiveness of its components. TraceCoder offers a scalable
and robust solution for automated ICD coding, aligning with clinical needs for
accuracy, interpretability, and reliability.

Motivation: 自动作文评分(AES)旨在提供高效准确的写作评估工具，研究两种流行相似度度量方法在向量空间模型中的有效性。

Method: 使用初中公民教育课程的形成性作文数据，通过n-gram模型提取特征并向量化，然后计算Jaccard系数和余弦相似度，通过RMSE评估系统性能。

Result: 余弦相似度优于Jaccard系数，一元文法比二元和三元文法具有更低的均方根误差。

Conclusion: 在自动作文评分中，余弦相似度结合一元文法特征能提供更好的评分性能。

Abstract: Automated essay scoring (AES) is a vital area of research aiming to provide
efficient and accurate assessment tools for evaluating written content. This
study investigates the effectiveness of two popular similarity metrics, Jaccard
coefficient, and Cosine similarity, within the context of vector space
models(VSM)employing unigram, bigram, and trigram representations. The data
used in this research was obtained from the formative essay of the citizenship
education subject in a junior high school. Each essay undergoes preprocessing
to extract features using n-gram models, followed by vectorization to transform
text data into numerical representations. Then, similarity scores are computed
between essays using both Jaccard coefficient and Cosine similarity. The
performance of the system is evaluated by analyzing the root mean square error
(RMSE), which measures the difference between the scores given by human graders
and those generated by the system. The result shows that the Cosine similarity
outperformed the Jaccard coefficient. In terms of n-gram, unigrams have lower
RMSE compared to bigrams and trigrams.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了TACL（阈值自适应课程学习）框架，通过动态调整训练过程来处理医学文本的复杂性差异，在多种临床任务中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学文本（特别是电子病历）具有非结构化、领域特定语言和上下文变异性等特点，现有方法将所有数据视为同等难度，忽略了复杂性差异，限制了模型在罕见或复杂病例上的泛化能力。

Method: TACL框架基于渐进学习原理，根据样本复杂度动态调整训练过程，将数据按难度分类，在训练早期优先处理简单案例以建立坚实基础，再处理复杂记录。

Result: 在包含英文和中文临床记录的多语言医学数据上应用TACL，在自动ICD编码、再入院预测和中医证候鉴别等多种临床任务中观察到显著改进。

Conclusion: TACL不仅提升了自动化系统的性能，还展示了统一不同医学领域方法的潜力，为更准确、可扩展和全球适用的医学文本理解解决方案铺平了道路。

Abstract: Medical texts, particularly electronic medical records (EMRs), are a
cornerstone of modern healthcare, capturing critical information about patient
care, diagnoses, and treatments. These texts hold immense potential for
advancing clinical decision-making and healthcare analytics. However, their
unstructured nature, domain-specific language, and variability across contexts
make automated understanding an intricate challenge. Despite the advancements
in natural language processing, existing methods often treat all data as
equally challenging, ignoring the inherent differences in complexity across
clinical records. This oversight limits the ability of models to effectively
generalize and perform well on rare or complex cases. In this paper, we present
TACL (Threshold-Adaptive Curriculum Learning), a novel framework designed to
address these challenges by rethinking how models interact with medical texts
during training. Inspired by the principle of progressive learning, TACL
dynamically adjusts the training process based on the complexity of individual
samples. By categorizing data into difficulty levels and prioritizing simpler
cases early in training, the model builds a strong foundation before tackling
more complex records. By applying TACL to multilingual medical data, including
English and Chinese clinical records, we observe significant improvements
across diverse clinical tasks, including automatic ICD coding, readmission
prediction and TCM syndrome differentiation. TACL not only enhances the
performance of automated systems but also demonstrates the potential to unify
approaches across disparate medical domains, paving the way for more accurate,
scalable, and globally applicable medical text understanding solutions.

TL;DR: 提出EGP框架，通过检索训练集中的成功推理路径作为示例，指导LLM在知识图谱问答中的规划过程，包括任务分解和关系探索，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在知识图谱问答中面临自然语言查询与结构化知识图谱之间的语义鸿沟，导致规划不优和探索效率低下，而无需训练的方法未能充分利用训练数据中的推理模式。

Method: EGP框架：1) 通过实体模板化预处理训练集问题；2) 使用语义嵌入和FAISS索引检索相似示例及其成功推理路径；3) 在任务分解和关系探索阶段动态指导LLM规划；4) 引入智能前瞻机制提高探索效率。

Result: 在WebQSP和CWQ两个真实世界KGQA数据集上的实验表明，PoG-EGP显著优于基线PoG系统和其他对比方法。

Conclusion: EGP框架通过示例引导规划有效提升了LLM在知识图谱问答中的规划能力，证明了利用训练数据中成功推理模式的价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as interactive agents show significant promise
in Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) but often struggle with the
semantic gap between natural language queries and structured knowledge graph
(KG) representations. This leads to suboptimal planning and inefficient
exploration on KG, while training-free approaches often underutilize valuable
reasoning patterns in training data. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel framework, Exemplar-Guided Planning (EGP), which enhances the planning
capabilities of LLM agents for KGQA. EGP first preprocesses the training set
questions via entity templating to normalize semantic variations. It then
retrieves highly similar exemplary questions and their successful reasoning
paths from this preprocessed set using semantic embeddings and an efficient
FAISS index. These retrieved exemplars dynamically guide the LLM's planning
process in two key phases: (1) Task Decomposition, by aligning generated
sub-objectives with proven reasoning steps, and (2) Relation Exploration, by
providing high-quality auxiliary information to improve relation pruning
accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a Smart Lookahead mechanism during
relation exploration to improve efficiency by preemptively exploring promising
paths and potentially terminating exploration earlier. We apply EGP to the
Plan-on-Graph (PoG) framework, termed PoG-EGP. Extensive experiments on two
real-world KGQA datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, demonstrate that PoG-EGP
significantly improves over the baseline PoG system and other compared methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理模型虽然性能强大，但检索和推理过程都消耗大量计算资源，导致高昂的计算成本。

Method: 1) 动态调整检索文档列表长度；2) 开发成本感知优势函数用于强化学习训练；3) 探索内存和延迟约束下的实现方案。

Result: 在7个公开问答数据集上评估，模型延迟降低16-20%，同时准确率平均提升5%。

Conclusion: 该方法在不牺牲效果的前提下显著提升了检索增强推理模型的效率，实现了计算成本和性能的双重优化。

Abstract: Reasoning models have gained significant attention due to their strong
performance, particularly when enhanced with retrieval augmentation. However,
these models often incur high computational costs, as both retrieval and
reasoning tokens contribute substantially to the overall resource usage. In
this work, we make the following contributions: (1) we propose a
retrieval-augmented reasoning model that dynamically adjusts the length of the
retrieved document list based on the query and retrieval results; (2) we
develop a cost-aware advantage function for training of efficient
retrieval-augmented reasoning models through reinforcement learning; and (3) we
explore both memory- and latency-bound implementations of the proposed
cost-aware framework for both proximal and group relative policy optimization
algorithms. We evaluate our approach on seven public question answering
datasets and demonstrate significant efficiency gains, without compromising
effectiveness. In fact, we observed that the model latency decreases by ~16-20%
across datasets, while its effectiveness increases by ~5% on average, in terms
of exact match.

TL;DR: CoordGen是一个移动推理框架，通过结合推测解码和动态硬件调度来加速移动设备上的上下文感知文本生成，实现了最高3.8倍的生成速度提升和4.7倍的能效提升。


<details>

Motivation: 移动设备上的大语言模型虽然可以通过本地数据进行个性化生成，但逐令牌生成的解码过程存在高延迟和硬件利用率低的问题，这限制了智能助手和UI代理等应用的发展。

Method: CoordGen框架包含三个协同组件：自适应执行调度（动态平衡预填充和解码阶段的计算图）、上下文对齐草稿（通过轻量级在线校准提高推测效率）、硬件高效草稿扩展（重用和扩展中间序列以提高并行性并降低验证成本）。

Result: 在多个智能手机和代表性工作负载上的实验表明，与现有移动推理解决方案相比，生成速度最高提升3.8倍，能效最高提升4.7倍。组件级分析进一步验证了每个优化的贡献。

Conclusion: CoordGen通过推测解码与动态硬件调度的集成，有效解决了移动设备上LLM推理的内存限制问题，为上下文感知文本生成提供了高效的移动端解决方案。

Abstract: Enhancing on-device large language models (LLMs) with contextual information
from local data enables personalized and task-aware generation, powering use
cases such as intelligent assistants and UI agents. While recent developments
in neural processors have substantially improved the efficiency of prefill on
mobile devices, the token-by-token generation process still suffers from high
latency and limited hardware utilization due to its inherently memory-bound
characteristics. This work presents CoordGen, a mobile inference framework that
integrates speculative decoding with dynamic hardware scheduling to accelerate
context-aware text generation on mobile devices. The framework introduces three
synergistic components: (1) adaptive execution scheduling, which dynamically
balances compute graphs between prefill and decoding phases; (2)
context-aligned drafting, which improves speculative efficiency through
lightweight online calibration to current tasks; and (3) hardware-efficient
draft extension, which reuses and expands intermediate sequences to improve
processing parallelism and reduce verification cost. Experiments on multiple
smartphones and representative workloads show consistent improvements of up to
3.8x in generation speed and 4.7x in energy efficiency compared with existing
mobile inference solutions. Component-level analysis further validates the
contribution of each optimization.

TL;DR: 提出了一个三步评估框架来评估大语言模型在古典中文诗歌生成和评估中的表现，发现LLM存在系统性偏见和"回音室"效应，与人类判断存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大语言模型在古典中文诗歌生成和评估中的表现，目前这方面的研究还很不足。

Method: 采用三步评估框架：计算指标、LLM作为评判者评估、人类专家验证，评估了六个最先进的LLM在诗歌质量多个维度的表现。

Result: 发现LLM在评估创意质量时存在"回音室"效应，常常趋同于有缺陷的标准，与人类判断存在分歧。

Conclusion: 当前LLM作为文学生成代理的能力存在潜力和局限性，在文化和技术上复杂的创意任务中需要人类和模型的混合验证。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to creative domains,
yet their performance in classical Chinese poetry generation and evaluation
remains poorly understood. We propose a three-step evaluation framework that
combines computational metrics, LLM-as-a-judge assessment, and human expert
validation. Using this framework, we evaluate six state-of-the-art LLMs across
multiple dimensions of poetic quality, including themes, emotions, imagery,
form, and style. Our analysis reveals systematic generation and evaluation
biases: LLMs exhibit "echo chamber" effects when assessing creative quality,
often converging on flawed standards that diverge from human judgments. These
findings highlight both the potential and limitations of current capabilities
of LLMs as proxy for literacy generation and the limited evaluation practices,
thereby demonstrating the continued need of hybrid validation from both humans
and models in culturally and technically complex creative tasks.

TL;DR: AutoGraph-R1是首个使用强化学习直接优化知识图谱构建以提升任务性能的框架，通过将图生成建模为策略学习问题，并设计任务感知的奖励函数，显著提升了图RAG方法在问答任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱构建过程与下游应用脱节，导致图结构不优化，影响了检索增强生成系统的效果。

Method: 使用强化学习训练LLM构造器，将图生成作为策略学习问题，设计了两种任务感知的奖励函数：作为知识载体的图和作为知识索引的图。

Result: 在多个问答基准测试中，AutoGraph-R1使图RAG方法相比任务无关的基线图谱实现了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该工作证明了构建与应用之间的闭环是可行的，将范式从构建内在'好'的图转向构建可证明'有用'的图。

Abstract: Building effective knowledge graphs (KGs) for Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) is pivotal for advancing question answering (QA) systems. However, its
effectiveness is hindered by a fundamental disconnect: the knowledge graph (KG)
construction process is decoupled from its downstream application, yielding
suboptimal graph structures. To bridge this gap, we introduce AutoGraph-R1, the
first framework to directly optimize KG construction for task performance using
Reinforcement Learning (RL). AutoGraph-R1 trains an LLM constructor by framing
graph generation as a policy learning problem, where the reward is derived from
the graph's functional utility in a RAG pipeline. We design two novel,
task-aware reward functions, one for graphs as knowledge carriers and another
as knowledge indices. Across multiple QA benchmarks, AutoGraph-R1 consistently
enables graph RAG methods to achieve significant performance gains over using
task-agnostic baseline graphs. Our work shows it is possible to close the loop
between construction and application, shifting the paradigm from building
intrinsically ``good'' graphs to building demonstrably ``useful'' ones.

TL;DR: 该论文发现传统可读性评估指标与人类感知存在不匹配，基于模型的方法在评估文本可读性方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可读性评估领域存在定义不一致的问题，且主要依赖表面文本特征，需要研究更符合人类感知的评估方法。

Method: 分析了897个人类判断，评估了15种传统可读性指标和6种基于模型的指标在5个英语数据集上的表现。

Result: 4种基于模型的指标在与人判断的相关性排名中始终位列前四，而表现最佳的传统指标平均排名仅为8.6。

Conclusion: 基于模型的方法是可读性评估的更有前景方向，能够更好地捕捉影响人类可读性感知的深层因素。

Abstract: Automatic readability assessment plays a key role in ensuring effective and
accessible written communication. Despite significant progress, the field is
hindered by inconsistent definitions of readability and measurements that rely
on surface-level text properties. In this work, we investigate the factors
shaping human perceptions of readability through the analysis of 897 judgments,
finding that, beyond surface-level cues, information content and topic strongly
shape text comprehensibility. Furthermore, we evaluate 15 popular readability
metrics across five English datasets, contrasting them with six more nuanced,
model-based metrics. Our results show that four model-based metrics
consistently place among the top four in rank correlations with human
judgments, while the best performing traditional metric achieves an average
rank of 8.6. These findings highlight a mismatch between current readability
metrics and human perceptions, pointing to model-based approaches as a more
promising direction.

TL;DR: SAFE是一个选择性集成LLM的框架，通过考虑分词不匹配和概率分布共识来选择集成位置，在长文本生成中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM集成方法在短文本中有效，但在长文本生成中效果不佳，因为每个token都集成会导致性能下降，需要更智能的集成策略。

Method: 提出SAFE框架，选择性集成LLM，考虑分词不匹配和概率分布共识两个因素，并引入概率锐化策略来合并同一单词的多个子词token的概率。

Result: 在MATH500和BBH等基准测试中，SAFE在准确性和效率上都优于现有方法，即使集成少于1%的token也能获得性能提升。

Conclusion: 选择性集成策略对于LLM在长文本生成中的有效集成至关重要，SAFE框架通过智能选择集成位置实现了更好的性能。

Abstract: Ensembling Large Language Models (LLMs) has gained attention as a promising
approach to surpass the performance of individual models by leveraging their
complementary strengths. In particular, aggregating models' next-token
probability distributions to select the next token has been shown to be
effective in various tasks. However, while successful for short-form answers,
its application to long-form generation remains underexplored. In this paper,
we show that using existing ensemble methods in long-form generation requires a
careful choice of ensembling positions, since the standard practice of
ensembling at every token often degrades performance. We identify two key
factors for determining these positions: tokenization mismatch across models
and consensus in their next-token probability distributions. Based on this, we
propose SAFE, (Stable And Fast LLM Ensembling), a framework that selectively
ensembles by jointly considering these factors. To further improve stability,
we introduce a probability sharpening strategy that consolidates probabilities
spread across multiple sub-word tokens representing the same word into a single
representative token. Our experiments on diverse benchmarks, including MATH500
and BBH, demonstrate that SAFE outperforms existing methods in both accuracy
and efficiency, with gains achieved even when ensembling fewer than 1% of
tokens.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扫描文档解析中复杂元素交织的挑战，现有监督微调方法泛化能力差，特别是在分布外数据上表现不佳，且高质量训练数据有限

Method: 使用强化学习框架LayoutRL，通过综合奖励函数优化布局理解，构建Infinity-Doc-400K数据集训练Infinity-Parser视觉语言模型

Result: 在多个基准测试中均取得最先进性能，显著优于专业文档解析系统和通用视觉语言模型，展现出强大的跨领域泛化能力

Conclusion: LayoutRL框架和Infinity-Parser模型为文档解析提供了有效的解决方案，具有优秀的泛化性能，将发布代码、数据集和模型以促进可复现研究

Abstract: Document parsing from scanned images into structured formats remains a
significant challenge due to its complexly intertwined elements such as text
paragraphs, figures, formulas, and tables. Existing supervised fine-tuning
methods often struggle to generalize across diverse document types, leading to
poor performance, particularly on out-of-distribution data. This issue is
further exacerbated by the limited availability of high-quality training data
for layout-aware parsing tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce
LayoutRL, a reinforcement learning framework that optimizes layout
understanding through composite rewards integrating normalized edit distance,
paragraph count accuracy, and reading order preservation. To support this
training, we construct the Infinity-Doc-400K dataset, which we use to train
Infinity-Parser, a vision-language model demonstrating robust generalization
across various domains. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks including
OmniDocBench, olmOCR-Bench, PubTabNet, and FinTabNet show that Infinity-Parser
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across a broad range of
document types, languages, and structural complexities, substantially
outperforming both specialized document parsing systems and general-purpose
vision-language models. We will release our code, dataset, and model to
facilitate reproducible research in document parsing.

TL;DR: Speech-LLMs在语音不流畅场景下表现不佳，特别是对帕金森病等语音障碍用户的处理存在显著性能下降，需要改进语音识别和推理能力来提升鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Speech-LLMs评估多基于理想化输入，忽略了常见的不流畅语音，特别是与帕金森病等疾病相关的语音障碍，需要测试其在真实世界中的适用性。

Method: 引入VocalBench-DF框架，系统评估22个主流Speech-LLMs在多维度分类下的不流畅语音处理能力，分析音素级处理和长上下文建模等瓶颈。

Result: 评估显示Speech-LLMs在处理语音障碍用户时出现显著性能下降，表明其实际应用准备度有限，音素级处理和长上下文建模是主要瓶颈。

Conclusion: 需要开发新方法来改进不流畅语音处理，构建真正包容的Speech-LLMs，增强识别和推理能力可以显著提高鲁棒性。

Abstract: While Speech Large Language Models (Speech-LLMs) show strong performance in
many applications, their robustness is critically under-tested, especially to
speech disfluency. Existing evaluations often rely on idealized inputs,
overlooking common disfluencies, particularly those associated with conditions
like Parkinson's disease. This work investigates whether current Speech-LLMs
can maintain performance when interacting with users who have speech
impairments. To facilitate this inquiry, we introduce VocalBench-DF, a
framework for the systematic evaluation of disfluency across a
multi-dimensional taxonomy. Our evaluation of 22 mainstream Speech-LLMs reveals
substantial performance degradation, indicating that their real-world readiness
is limited. Further analysis identifies phoneme-level processing and
long-context modeling as primary bottlenecks responsible for these failures.
Strengthening recognition and reasoning capability from components and
pipelines can substantially improve robustness. These findings highlight the
urgent need for new methods to improve disfluency handling and build truly
inclusive Speech-LLMs

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推荐系统方法不适合游戏广告和推荐，主要因为游戏稀疏性（游戏数量少）和游戏不平衡性（用户行为集中在少数热门游戏）。

Method: 引入用户游戏生命周期(UGL)丰富用户行为数据，提出两种创新策略提取用户短期和长期兴趣，使用逆概率掩码策略处理游戏不平衡问题。

Result: 离线实验平均AUC提升1.83%，在线实验游戏广告CVR提升21.67%，游戏内物品推荐AUC提升0.5%，ARPU提升0.82%。

Conclusion: UGL表示方法能有效解决游戏推荐中的稀疏性和不平衡问题，显著提升游戏广告和推荐的性能表现。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of video game production necessitates the development of
effective advertising and recommendation systems for online game platforms.
Recommending and advertising games to users hinges on capturing their interest
in games. However, existing representation learning methods crafted for
handling billions of items in recommendation systems are unsuitable for game
advertising and recommendation. This is primarily due to game sparsity, where
the mere hundreds of games fall short for large-scale user representation
learning, and game imbalance, where user behaviors are overwhelmingly dominated
by a handful of popular games. To address the sparsity issue, we introduce the
User Game Lifecycle (UGL), designed to enrich user behaviors in games.
Additionally, we propose two innovative strategies aimed at manipulating user
behaviors to more effectively extract both short and long-term interests. To
tackle the game imbalance challenge, we present an Inverse Probability Masking
strategy for UGL representation learning. The offline and online experimental
results demonstrate that the UGL representations significantly enhance model by
achieving a 1.83% AUC offline increase on average and a 21.67% CVR online
increase on average for game advertising and a 0.5% AUC offline increase and a
0.82% ARPU online increase for in-game item recommendation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强生成系统在基于马来西亚临床实践指南提供事实指导方面很重要，但处理图像查询时效果有限，因为通用视觉语言模型的描述缺乏临床特异性和事实基础。

Method: 采用知识蒸馏管道创建皮肤病学、眼底和胸部放射学领域的合成数据集，并使用参数高效的QLoRA方法对MedGemma模型进行微调。

Result: 微调后的模型在分类性能上有显著提升，RAGAS评估确认了描述忠实度和正确性的显著改善，验证了模型生成可靠、事实基础描述的能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了一个专门化医学视觉语言模型的强大管道，并验证了所得模型作为高质量查询生成器的有效性，为增强多模态RAG系统在循证临床决策支持中的应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems are essential for providing fact-based
guidance from Malaysian Clinical Practice Guidelines. However, their
effectiveness with image-based queries is limited, as general Vision-Language
Model captions often lack clinical specificity and factual grounding. This
study proposes and validates a framework to specialize the MedGemma model for
generating high-fidelity captions that serve as superior queries. To overcome
data scarcity, we employ a knowledge distillation pipeline to create a
synthetic dataset across dermatology, fundus, and chest radiography domains,
and fine-tune MedGemma using the parameter-efficient QLoRA method. Performance
was rigorously assessed through a dual framework measuring both classification
accuracy and, via a novel application of the RAGAS framework, caption
faithfulness, relevancy, and correctness. The fine-tuned model demonstrated
substantial improvements in classification performance, while RAGAS evaluation
confirmed significant gains in caption faithfulness and correctness, validating
the models ability to produce reliable, factually grounded descriptions. This
work establishes a robust pipeline for specializing medical VLMs and validates
the resulting model as a high-quality query generator, laying the groundwork
for enhancing multimodal RAG systems in evidence-based clinical decision
support.

Motivation: 现有MLLM评估主要关注被动推理，这与现实世界信息不完整的情况不符。需要研究MLLM能否主动获取缺失证据并进行迭代决策。

Method: 提出GuessBench基准，包含感知导向和知识导向的图像，要求模型在无任务先验的情况下从候选池中选择目标图像来主动获取证据并迭代优化决策。

Result: 评估了20个优秀MLLM，发现主动推理性能远低于被动推理。细粒度感知和及时决策是主要挑战。消融研究表明感知增强对小模型有益，而思维导向方法对所有模型都有稳定提升。

Conclusion: 多模态主动推理有巨大的改进空间，感知增强和思维导向方法是未来研究的两个有前景的方向。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities
across a broad range of benchmarks. However, most existing evaluations focus on
passive inference, where models perform step-by-step reasoning under complete
information. This setup is misaligned with real-world use, where seeing is not
enough. This raises a fundamental question: Can MLLMs actively acquire missing
evidence under incomplete information? To bridge this gap, we require the MLLMs
to actively acquire missing evidence and iteratively refine decisions under
incomplete information, by selecting a target image from a candidate pool
without task-specific priors. To support systematic study, we propose
GuessBench, a benchmark with both perception-oriented and knowledge-oriented
images for evaluating active reasoning in MLLMs. We evaluate 20 superior MLLMs
and find that performance on active reasoning lags far behind it on passive
settings, indicating substantial room for improvement. Further analysis
identifies fine-grained perception and timely decision-making as key
challenges. Ablation studies show that perceptual enhancements benefit smaller
models, whereas thinking-oriented methods provide consistent gains across model
sizes. These results suggest promising directions for future research on
multimodal active reasoning.

Motivation: 解决传统方法在摘要质量和可控性方面的问题，提升大语言模型在摘要生成中的表现。

Method: 设计多阶段提示生成框架，包括语义分析、主题建模和噪声控制，使用CNN/Daily Mail数据集进行实验分析。

Result: 提示长度对摘要质量影响显著，过短或过长都会降低质量；数据噪声增加会导致ROUGE-L分数下降；新闻文本处理效果最佳，学术文章效果较差。

Conclusion: 通过控制提示策略和优化文本预处理，可以有效提升大语言模型生成摘要的准确性和可控性。

Abstract: This study presents a controllable abstract summary generation method for
large language models based on prompt engineering. To address the issues of
summary quality and controllability in traditional methods, we design a
multi-stage prompt generation framework. This framework generates summaries
with varying levels of abstraction by performing semantic analysis, topic
modeling, and noise control on the input text. The experiment uses the
CNN/Daily Mail dataset and provides a detailed analysis of different prompt
lengths, data noise, and text types. The experimental results show that prompt
length has a significant impact on the quality of generated summaries. Both
very short and very long prompt tokens result in a decrease in summary quality.
Data noise also negatively affects the summary generation process. As noise
levels increase, the ROUGE-L score gradually decreases. Furthermore, different
text types have varying effects on the model's ability to generate summaries.
The model performs best when handling news texts, while its performance is
worse when processing academic articles. This research provides new insights
into improving summary generation using large language models, particularly in
how controlling prompt strategies and optimizing text preprocessing can enhance
summary accuracy and controllability.

TL;DR: CORE是一个协作框架，结合云端和本地LLM的优势，在保持移动代理任务准确性的同时减少UI暴露。通过布局感知块分区、协同规划和协同决策，将UI暴露减少高达55.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云端LLM需要上传完整UI状态，暴露不必要信息；本地LLM容量有限，任务成功率低。需要平衡隐私保护和任务准确性。

Method: 1) 基于XML层次结构的布局感知块分区；2) 本地和云端LLM协同规划子任务；3) 本地LLM排序相关UI块，云端LLM在顶级块内选择具体元素；4) 多轮累积机制缓解本地误判。

Result: 实验显示CORE将UI暴露减少高达55.6%，任务成功率略低于纯云端代理，有效减轻不必要的云隐私暴露。

Conclusion: CORE框架成功平衡了隐私保护和任务准确性，为移动代理提供了一种实用的隐私保护解决方案。

Abstract: Mobile agents rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) to plan and execute tasks
on smartphone user interfaces (UIs). While cloud-based LLMs achieve high task
accuracy, they require uploading the full UI state at every step, exposing
unnecessary and often irrelevant information. In contrast, local LLMs avoid UI
uploads but suffer from limited capacity, resulting in lower task success
rates. We propose $\textbf{CORE}$, a $\textbf{CO}$llaborative framework that
combines the strengths of cloud and local LLMs to $\textbf{R}$educe UI
$\textbf{E}$xposure, while maintaining task accuracy for mobile agents. CORE
comprises three key components: (1) $\textbf{Layout-aware block partitioning}$,
which groups semantically related UI elements based on the XML screen
hierarchy; (2) $\textbf{Co-planning}$, where local and cloud LLMs
collaboratively identify the current sub-task; and (3)
$\textbf{Co-decision-making}$, where the local LLM ranks relevant UI blocks,
and the cloud LLM selects specific UI elements within the top-ranked block.
CORE further introduces a multi-round accumulation mechanism to mitigate local
misjudgment or limited context. Experiments across diverse mobile apps and
tasks show that CORE reduces UI exposure by up to 55.6% while maintaining task
success rates slightly below cloud-only agents, effectively mitigating
unnecessary privacy exposure to the cloud. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型能力的快速提升，出现了可能在高风险部署中引发严重风险的欺骗行为，而现实场景中欺骗行为的特征研究仍不足。

Method: 建立DeceptionBench基准，从内在维度（利己主义vs讨好行为）和外在维度（中性条件、奖励激励、胁迫压力）系统评估欺骗行为，并引入持续多轮交互循环模拟真实世界反馈动态。

Result: 实验发现大语言模型和大推理模型存在严重漏洞，特别是在强化动态下欺骗行为会加剧，表明当前模型缺乏对操纵性上下文线索的鲁棒抵抗力。

Conclusion: 当前模型对各种欺骗行为缺乏足够的防护机制，迫切需要开发先进的防护措施来应对这些风险。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable advances of Large Language Models (LLMs) across
diverse cognitive tasks, the rapid enhancement of these capabilities also
introduces emergent deceptive behaviors that may induce severe risks in
high-stakes deployments. More critically, the characterization of deception
across realistic real-world scenarios remains underexplored. To bridge this
gap, we establish DeceptionBench, the first benchmark that systematically
evaluates how deceptive tendencies manifest across different societal domains,
what their intrinsic behavioral patterns are, and how extrinsic factors affect
them. Specifically, on the static count, the benchmark encompasses 150
meticulously designed scenarios in five domains, i.e., Economy, Healthcare,
Education, Social Interaction, and Entertainment, with over 1,000 samples,
providing sufficient empirical foundations for deception analysis. On the
intrinsic dimension, we explore whether models exhibit self-interested egoistic
tendencies or sycophantic behaviors that prioritize user appeasement. On the
extrinsic dimension, we investigate how contextual factors modulate deceptive
outputs under neutral conditions, reward-based incentivization, and coercive
pressures. Moreover, we incorporate sustained multi-turn interaction loops to
construct a more realistic simulation of real-world feedback dynamics.
Extensive experiments across LLMs and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) reveal
critical vulnerabilities, particularly amplified deception under reinforcement
dynamics, demonstrating that current models lack robust resistance to
manipulative contextual cues and the urgent need for advanced safeguards
against various deception behaviors. Code and resources are publicly available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在时间敏感领域（如法律、医疗、金融）中作为知识源的广泛应用，需要确保其不仅事实准确，还要在时间维度上保持一致性，但目前缺乏针对LLMs时间一致性的评估和增强方法。

Method: 提出了TEMP-ReCon基准来评估开源和闭源LLMs在多语言环境下的时间指称一致性，并开发了基于推理路径对齐的UnTRaP模型来提升LLMs的时间一致性。

Result: 实验结果表明，当前LLMs在时间指称一致性方面表现不足，而UnTRaP模型相比多个基线模型在提升时间一致性方面表现出显著效果。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了LLMs时间一致性评估和增强的空白，提出的基准和模型为提升LLMs在时间敏感应用中的可靠性提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The increasing acceptance of large language models (LLMs) as an alternative
to knowledge sources marks a significant paradigm shift across various domains,
including time-sensitive fields such as law, healthcare, and finance. To
fulfill this expanded role, LLMs must not only be factually accurate but also
demonstrate consistency across temporal dimensions, necessitating robust
temporal reasoning capabilities. Despite this critical requirement, efforts to
ensure temporal consistency in LLMs remain scarce including noticeable absence
of endeavors aimed at evaluating or augmenting LLMs across temporal references
in time-sensitive inquiries. In this paper, we seek to address this gap by
introducing a novel benchmark entitled temporal referential consistency,
accompanied by a resource TEMP-ReCon designed to benchmark a wide range of both
open-source and closed-source LLMs with various linguistic contexts
characterized by differing resource richness (including English, French, and
Romanian). The findings emphasis that LLMs do exhibit insufficient temporal
referent consistency. To address this, we propose \newmodel, a reasoning path
alignment-based model that aims to enhance the temporal referential consistency
of LLMs. Our empirical experiments substantiate the efficacy of UnTRaP compared
to several baseline models.

*Rares Dolga,Lucas Maystre,Tudor Berariu,David Barber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态字符分组方法，利用现有BPE分词结构，通过添加显式补丁结束标记和二级BPE压缩来控制补丁粒度，实现高效、灵活且语言无关的表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决子词分词方法在表示罕见词时的低效性和需要大嵌入矩阵的问题，同时避免字符级模型的性能瓶颈和现有分层模型的局限性。

Method: 在BPE分词基础上添加显式补丁结束标记，然后进行二级BPE压缩来控制补丁粒度，无需额外模型依赖。

Result: 经验结果表明，该方法在保持紧凑词汇表的同时，匹配或超过了基于动态熵和空白的补丁策略性能。

Conclusion: 提出的动态字符分组方法提供了一种高效、灵活且语言无关的表示方案，成功结合了子词和字符级模型的优势。

Abstract: Subword tokenization methods like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) are widely used in
large language models due to their balance of vocabulary compactness and
representational power. However, they suffer from inefficiencies in
representing rare words and require large embedding matrices. Character-level
models address these issues but introduce performance bottlenecks, particularly
in Transformer-based architectures. Recent hierarchical models attempt to merge
the benefits of both paradigms by grouping characters into patches, but
existing patching strategies either rely on whitespace-limiting applicability
to certain languages, or require auxiliary models that introduce new
dependencies. In this paper, we propose a dynamic character grouping method
that leverages the structure of existing BPE tokenization without requiring
additional models. By appending explicit end-of-patch markers to BPE tokens and
introducing a second-level BPE compression stage to control patch granularity,
our method offers efficient, flexible, and language-agnostic representations.
Empirical results demonstrate that our approach matches or exceeds the
performance of dynamic entropy- and whitespace-based patching strategies, while
maintaining a compact vocabulary.

### [122] [Latent Reasoning in LLMs as a Vocabulary-Space Superposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15522)
*Jingcheng Deng,Liang Pang,Zihao Wei,Shichen Xu,Zenghao Duan,Kun Xu,Yang Song,Huawei Shen,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Latent-SFT是一种两阶段学习框架，通过在词汇表概率的叠加空间中进行潜在推理，显著减少计算开销，同时保持与显式推理相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显式推理（如思维链）虽然效果好但计算成本高，而现有的潜在推理方法性能下降严重。研究发现性能下降源于非结构化的潜在空间，难以拟合潜在标记。

Method: 提出Latent-SFT两阶段框架：第一阶段设计专门注意力掩码指导潜在标记编码器生成潜在标记；第二阶段丢弃编码器，直接训练LLM自主生成潜在标记进行推理，使用KL和CE损失优化。

Result: 在GSM8k上达到新SOTA，匹配显式SFT性能同时将推理链缩短最多4倍；在Math500和AIME24上，基于词汇概率的潜在推理明显优于基于隐藏状态的方法。

Conclusion: 潜在推理既是单一路径的压缩，也是多路径的叠加，有效平衡了计算效率和推理性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning abilities with
chain-of-thought prompting, but explicit reasoning introduces substantial
computational overhead. Recent work on latent reasoning reduces this cost by
reasoning in latent space without explicit supervision, but performance drops
significantly. Our preliminary experiments suggest that this degradation stems
from the unstructured latent space, which makes fitting latent tokens
difficult. To address this, we restrict the latent space to the column space of
the LLM vocabulary, treating latent reasoning as a superposition over
vocabulary probabilities. Once latent reasoning concludes, it collapses into an
eigenstate of explicit reasoning to yield the final answer. Based on this idea,
we propose Latent-SFT, a two-stage learning framework. In the first stage, we
design two specialized attention masks to guide the Latent Token Encoder in
generating latent tokens, allowing the LLM to produce the correct answer
conditioned on them. In the second stage, the Latent Token Encoder is
discarded, and the LLM is directly trained to generate these latent tokens
autonomously for latent reasoning, optimized with KL and CE losses. Latent-SFT
sets a new state of the art on GSM8k, matching explicit SFT performance while
cutting reasoning chains by up to 4 times and outperforming prior latent
methods. On Math500 and AIME24, lexical probability-based latent reasoning also
clearly surpasses hidden-state-based approaches. Our metrics of effective
compression rate and effective global parallelism further show that latent
reasoning is both the compression of a single path and the superposition of
multiple paths.

### [123] [TokenTiming: A Dynamic Alignment Method for Universal Speculative Decoding Model Pairs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15545)
*Sibo Xiao,Jinyuan Fu,Zhongle Xie,Lidan Shou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出TokenTiming算法，通过动态时间规整技术解决推测解码中草稿模型和目标模型必须共享词汇表的问题，实现通用推测解码，获得1.57倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推测解码要求草稿模型和目标模型共享词汇表，限制了可用草稿模型的选择范围，往往需要从头训练新模型，这成为LLM推理加速的关键瓶颈。

Method: 基于动态时间规整算法，通过重新编码草稿标记序列获得新的目标标记序列，然后使用DTW建立映射关系来传输概率分布进行推测采样。

Result: 在多种任务上的综合实验表明，该方法实现了1.57倍的加速效果，能够处理不匹配的词汇表，且无需重新训练和修改即可与任何现成模型配合使用。

Conclusion: 这项工作为草稿模型选择提供了一种通用方法，使推测解码成为更通用和实用的LLM加速工具。

Abstract: Accelerating the inference of large language models (LLMs) has been a
critical challenge in generative AI. Speculative decoding (SD) substantially
improves LLM inference efficiency. However, its utility is limited by a
fundamental constraint: the draft and target models must share the same
vocabulary, thus limiting the herd of available draft models and often
necessitating the training of a new model from scratch. Inspired by Dynamic
Time Warping (DTW), a classic algorithm for aligning time series, we propose
the algorithm TokenTiming for universal speculative decoding. It operates by
re-encoding the draft token sequence to get a new target token sequence, and
then uses DTW to build a mapping to transfer the probability distributions for
speculative sampling. Benefiting from this, our method accommodates mismatched
vocabularies and works with any off-the-shelf models without retraining and
modification. We conduct comprehensive experiments on various tasks,
demonstrating 1.57x speedup. This work enables a universal approach for draft
model selection, making SD a more versatile and practical tool for LLM
acceleration.

*Vihari Piratla,Purvam Jain,Darshan Singh,Partha Talukdar,Trevor Cohn*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过偏差-方差分解重新定义跨语言差距，提出目标语言响应方差是主要原因，并通过降低方差的方法显著提升目标语言准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将跨语言差距归因于源语言和目标语言潜在表征的差异，但本文提出目标语言响应方差才是主要原因

Method: 采用偏差-方差分解形式化跨语言差距，通过推理时干预控制方差，包括简单的提示指令来降低响应方差

Result: 通过降低响应方差，目标语言准确率提高了20-25%，验证了方差是跨语言差距主要来源的假设

Conclusion: 跨语言差距主要源于目标语言响应方差而非表征差异，通过控制方差能有效缩小这一差距

Abstract: Any piece of knowledge is usually expressed in one or a handful of natural
languages on the web or in any large corpus. Large Language Models (LLMs) act
as a bridge by acquiring knowledge from a source language and making it
accessible when queried from target languages. Prior research has pointed to a
cross-lingual gap, viz., a drop in accuracy when the knowledge is queried in a
target language compared to when the query is in the source language. Existing
research has rationalized divergence in latent representations in source and
target languages as the source of cross-lingual gap. In this work, we take an
alternative view and hypothesize that the variance of responses in the target
language is the main cause of this gap. For the first time, we formalize the
cross-lingual gap in terms of bias-variance decomposition. We present extensive
experimental evidence which support proposed formulation and hypothesis. We
then reinforce our hypothesis through multiple inference-time interventions
that control the variance and reduce the cross-lingual gap. We demonstrate a
simple prompt instruction to reduce the response variance, which improved
target accuracy by 20-25% across different models.

### [125] [Think Parallax: Solving Multi-Hop Problems via Multi-View Knowledge-Graph-Based Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15552)
*Jinliang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了ParallaxRAG框架，通过对称解耦查询和图三元组到多视图空间，构建鲁棒的检索架构，在约束弱相关路径的同时显式增强头多样性，以改善多跳推理中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在语言理解方面表现出色，但经常产生幻觉并在多跳推理中遇到困难。基于知识图谱的检索增强生成方法提供了基础，但大多数方法依赖于扁平嵌入和噪声路径探索。

Method: ParallaxRAG框架将查询和图三元组对称解耦到多视图空间，利用不同注意力头在不同推理阶段专门处理语义关系的特点，构建更清晰的子图并引导LLMs进行基于基础的逐步推理。

Result: 在WebQSP和CWQ数据集上的实验表明，该方法在检索和问答性能上具有竞争力，同时减少了幻觉并展现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 多视图头专业化是知识基础多跳推理的一个原则性方向，为改善LLMs的推理能力提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at language understanding but often
hallucinate and struggle with multi-hop reasoning. Knowledge-graph-based
retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) offers grounding, yet most methods rely
on flat embeddings and noisy path exploration. We propose ParallaxRAG, a
framework that symmetrically decouples queries and graph triples into
multi-view spaces, enabling a robust retrieval architecture that explicitly
enforces head diversity while constraining weakly related paths. Central to our
approach is the observation that different attention heads specialize in
semantic relations at distinct reasoning stages, contributing to different hops
of the reasoning chain. This specialization allows ParallaxRAG to construct
cleaner subgraphs and guide LLMs through grounded, step-wise reasoning.
Experiments on WebQSP and CWQ, under our unified, reproducible setup (BGE-M3 +
Llama3.1-8B), demonstrate competitive retrieval and QA performance, alongside
reduced hallucination and good generalization. Our results highlight multi-view
head specialization as a principled direction for knowledge-grounded multi-hop
reasoning. Our implementation will be released as soon as the paper is
accepted.

*Dongjun Kim,Chanhee Park,Chanjun Park,Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了KITE基准，专门评估韩语大语言模型的指令跟随能力，填补了韩语开放指令评估的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估主要关注英语模型，忽视了其他语言的独特语言文化特征，特别是韩语在语法、形态、敬语和数字系统等方面的特殊性。

Method: 开发了KITE基准，结合自动指标和人工评估，针对一般和韩语特定指令进行综合评估。

Result: 揭示了不同模型间的性能差异，深入分析了模型的优势和弱点。

Conclusion: 通过公开KITE数据集和代码，促进文化和语言包容性LLM开发，并激励其他代表性不足语言的类似研究。

Abstract: The instruction-following capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are
pivotal for numerous applications, from conversational agents to complex
reasoning systems. However, current evaluations predominantly focus on English
models, neglecting the linguistic and cultural nuances of other languages.
Specifically, Korean, with its distinct syntax, rich morphological features,
honorific system, and dual numbering systems, lacks a dedicated benchmark for
assessing open-ended instruction-following capabilities. To address this gap,
we introduce the Korean Instruction-following Task Evaluation (KITE), a
comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate both general and Korean-specific
instructions. Unlike existing Korean benchmarks that focus mainly on factual
knowledge or multiple-choice testing, KITE directly targets diverse, open-ended
instruction-following tasks. Our evaluation pipeline combines automated metrics
with human assessments, revealing performance disparities across models and
providing deeper insights into their strengths and weaknesses. By publicly
releasing the KITE dataset and code, we aim to foster further research on
culturally and linguistically inclusive LLM development and inspire similar
endeavors for other underrepresented languages.

Conclusion: 乌尔都语诗歌通过其独特的词汇选择展现了爱情表达的丰富复杂性，这些细微的情感差异体现了乌尔都语文化的深度，为理解跨文化情感表达提供了重要见解。

Abstract: This paper delves into the intricate world of Urdu poetry, exploring its
thematic depths through a lens of polysemy. By focusing on the nuanced
differences between three seemingly synonymous words (pyaar, muhabbat, and
ishq) we expose a spectrum of emotions and experiences unique to the Urdu
language. This study employs a polysemic case study approach, meticulously
examining how these words are interwoven within the rich tapestry of Urdu
poetry. By analyzing their usage and context, we uncover a hidden layer of
meaning, revealing subtle distinctions which lack direct equivalents in English
literature. Furthermore, we embark on a comparative analysis, generating word
embeddings for both Urdu and English terms related to love. This enables us to
quantify and visualize the semantic space occupied by these words, providing
valuable insights into the cultural and linguistic nuances of expressing love.
Through this multifaceted approach, our study sheds light on the captivating
complexities of Urdu poetry, offering a deeper understanding and appreciation
for its unique portrayal of love and its myriad expressions

TL;DR: 提出跨语言双向最大相似度评分方法，在保持与最优传输方法相当准确度的同时，速度提升约100倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文档对齐方法在大规模网络挖掘数据中，需要同时考虑准确性和速度

Method: 提出跨语言双向最大相似度评分方法，用于计算文档间相似度

Result: 在WMT16双语文档对齐任务中，BiMax方法达到与最优传输方法相当的准确度，速度提升约100倍

Conclusion: BiMax方法在文档对齐任务中实现了准确性和效率的良好平衡，相关工具已开源

Abstract: Document alignment is necessary for the hierarchical mining (Ba\~n\'on et
al., 2020; Morishita et al., 2022), which aligns documents across source and
target languages within the same web domain. Several high precision sentence
embedding-based methods have been developed, such as TK-PERT (Thompson and
Koehn, 2020) and Optimal Transport (OT) (Clark et al., 2019; El-Kishky and
Guzm\'an, 2020). However, given the massive scale of web mining data, both
accuracy and speed must be considered. In this paper, we propose a
cross-lingual Bidirectional Maxsim score (BiMax) for computing doc-to-doc
similarity, to improve efficiency compared to the OT method. Consequently, on
the WMT16 bilingual document alignment task, BiMax attains accuracy comparable
to OT with an approximate 100-fold speed increase. Meanwhile, we also conduct a
comprehensive analysis to investigate the performance of current
state-of-the-art multilingual sentence embedding models. All the alignment
methods in this paper are publicly available as a tool called EmbDA
(https://github.com/EternalEdenn/EmbDA).

Motivation: 虽然指代消解在计算文学研究中受到越来越多的关注，但完全标注的长文档代表性数据集仍然非常稀缺。

Method: 引入了一个包含三本完整法语小说的新标注语料库，总计超过285,000个词符，并提出了一个模块化的指代消解流程。

Result: 该方法具有竞争力，能有效扩展到长文档，并能用于推断虚构人物的性别。

Conclusion: 该语料库和流程对于文学分析和下游NLP任务都具有重要意义。

Abstract: While coreference resolution is attracting more interest than ever from
computational literature researchers, representative datasets of fully
annotated long documents remain surprisingly scarce. In this paper, we
introduce a new annotated corpus of three full-length French novels, totaling
over 285,000 tokens. Unlike previous datasets focused on shorter texts, our
corpus addresses the challenges posed by long, complex literary works, enabling
evaluation of coreference models in the context of long reference chains. We
present a modular coreference resolution pipeline that allows for fine-grained
error analysis. We show that our approach is competitive and scales effectively
to long documents. Finally, we demonstrate its usefulness to infer the gender
of fictional characters, showcasing its relevance for both literary analysis
and downstream NLP tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HypoSpace是一个评估语言模型生成多种合理解释能力的诊断套件，通过有效性、独特性和覆盖率三个指标来衡量模型在不确定科学问题中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型在科学工作流中的广泛应用，需要评估它们提出多种解释（而非单一正确答案）的能力，因为许多科学问题存在不确定性，多个机制不同的假设可能与相同观察结果一致。

Method: HypoSpace将LLMs视为有限假设集的采样器，在三个结构化领域实例化：因果图、重力约束3D体素重建和布尔遗传相互作用，这些领域具有确定性验证器和精确枚举的假设空间。

Result: 研究发现，在指令调优和推理导向模型中，有效性通常保持较高，但随着可接受空间的增长，独特性和覆盖率会下降，揭示了仅靠正确性指标无法发现的模式崩溃现象。

Conclusion: HypoSpace提供了一个受控的探测工具（而非排行榜），用于评估那些明确探索和覆盖可接受解释空间的方法。

Abstract: As language models are increasingly used in scientific workflows, evaluating
their ability to propose sets of explanations-not just a single correct
answer-becomes critical. Many scientific problems are underdetermined:
multiple, mechanistically distinct hypotheses are consistent with the same
observations. We introduce HypoSpace, a diagnostic suite that treats LLMs as
samplers of finite hypothesis sets and measures three complementary indicators:
Validity (precision of proposals consistent with observations), Uniqueness
(non-redundancy among proposals), and Recovery (coverage of the enumerated
admissible set). We instantiate HypoSpace in three structured domains with
deterministic validators and exactly enumerated hypothesis spaces: (i) causal
graphs from perturbations, (ii) gravity-constrained 3D voxel reconstruction
from top-down projections, and (iii) Boolean genetic interactions. Across
instruction-tuned and reasoning-focused models, Validity often remains high
while Uniqueness and Recovery degrade as the admissible space grows, revealing
mode collapse that is invisible to correctness-only metrics. HypoSpace offers a
controlled probe-rather than a leaderboard-for methods that explicitly explore
and cover admissible explanation spaces. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 使用LLM作为动态知识库生成背景上下文，通过四种方法将上下文整合到仇恨言论检测分类器中，在文本和多模态场景中分别提升3和6个F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用LLM生成背景上下文来增强仇恨言论检测，特别是针对隐式仇恨言论和表情包等复杂场景。

Method: 提出两种上下文生成策略（命名实体聚焦和全文提示），比较四种上下文整合方法：文本拼接、嵌入拼接、分层transformer融合和LLM驱动文本增强。

Result: 在文本Latent Hatred数据集和多模态MAMI数据集上，嵌入拼接方法表现最佳，相比零上下文基线分别提升3和6个F1分数。

Conclusion: 上下文信息和整合方法对仇恨言论检测至关重要，嵌入拼接是最有效的整合策略。

Abstract: This research introduces a novel approach to textual and multimodal Hate
Speech Detection (HSD), using Large Language Models (LLMs) as dynamic knowledge
bases to generate background context and incorporate it into the input of HSD
classifiers. Two context generation strategies are examined: one focused on
named entities and the other on full-text prompting. Four methods of
incorporating context into the classifier input are compared: text
concatenation, embedding concatenation, a hierarchical transformer-based
fusion, and LLM-driven text enhancement. Experiments are conducted on the
textual Latent Hatred dataset of implicit hate speech and applied in a
multimodal setting on the MAMI dataset of misogynous memes. Results suggest
that both the contextual information and the method by which it is incorporated
are key, with gains of up to 3 and 6 F1 points on textual and multimodal setups
respectively, from a zero-context baseline to the highest-performing system,
based on embedding concatenation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文实证分析了掩码扩散语言模型(DLMs)的注意力模式，发现DLMs存在动态变化的注意力下沉现象，但与自回归模型(ARMs)不同，DLMs对注意力下沉的移除具有鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管DLMs在效率和性能上表现出色，但其内部工作机制尚未得到充分探索。本文旨在研究DLMs的注意力模式，特别是注意力下沉现象。

Method: 通过实证分析DLMs的注意力模式，重点关注注意力下沉现象，并与ARMs进行对比研究。

Result: 发现DLMs存在动态变化的注意力下沉现象，且对注意力下沉的移除具有鲁棒性，性能仅轻微下降。

Conclusion: DLMs与ARMs在注意力分配和利用方式上存在根本性差异，这为理解扩散语言模型的内部工作机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional Autoregressive Models (ARMs). DLMs employ
transformer encoders with bidirectional attention, enabling parallel token
generation while maintaining competitive performance. Although their efficiency
and effectiveness have been extensively studied, the internal mechanisms that
govern DLMs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct an empirical
analysis of DLM attention patterns, focusing on the attention sinking
phenomenon, an effect previously observed in various transformer-based
architectures. Our findings reveal that DLMs also exhibit attention sinks, but
with distinct characteristics. First, unlike in ARMs, the sink positions in
DLMs tend to shift throughout the generation process, displaying a dynamic
behaviour. Second, while ARMs are highly sensitive to the removal of attention
sinks, DLMs remain robust: masking sinks leads to only a minor degradation in
performance. These results provide new insights into the inner workings of
diffusion-based language models and highlight fundamental differences in how
they allocate and utilize attention compared to autoregressive models.

Motivation: 传统评估方法依赖固定格式任务和参考答案，难以捕捉现代LLM行为的细微、主观和开放式特性，因此需要更有效的评估方式。

Method: 提出自动互评框架，让LLM通过自博弈和同行评审相互评估输出，并采用博弈论投票算法聚合同行评审结果，系统比较模型生成排名与人类判断的一致性。

Result: 实证结果显示理论预测与人类评估之间存在收敛和分歧，揭示了互评方法的潜力和局限性。

Conclusion: 这是首个将互评、博弈论聚合和基于人类的验证相结合来评估LLM能力的工作，为LLM评估提供了新的视角和方法。

Abstract: Ideal or real - that is the question.In this work, we explore whether
principles from game theory can be effectively applied to the evaluation of
large language models (LLMs). This inquiry is motivated by the growing
inadequacy of conventional evaluation practices, which often rely on
fixed-format tasks with reference answers and struggle to capture the nuanced,
subjective, and open-ended nature of modern LLM behavior. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel alternative: automatic mutual evaluation, where
LLMs assess each other's output through self-play and peer review. These peer
assessments are then systematically compared with human voting behavior to
evaluate their alignment with human judgment. Our framework incorporates
game-theoretic voting algorithms to aggregate peer reviews, enabling a
principled investigation into whether model-generated rankings reflect human
preferences. Empirical results reveal both convergences and divergences between
theoretical predictions and human evaluations, offering valuable insights into
the promises and limitations of mutual evaluation. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to jointly integrate mutual evaluation,
game-theoretic aggregation, and human-grounded validation for evaluating the
capabilities of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需参考翻译或与动物互动的机器翻译质量评估方法，通过逐段翻译和shuffle测试来验证翻译器是否有效工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决如何验证AI动物语言翻译器的问题，避免与动物交互带来的安全、伦理和成本问题，实现无参考翻译的机器翻译质量评估。

Method: 使用逐段翻译结合经典的NLP shuffle测试，通过比较顺序翻译与随机排列翻译的合理性来评估翻译质量。

Result: 在数据稀缺的人类语言和构造语言上的概念验证实验表明，该方法与基于参考翻译的标准评估方法高度相关。

Conclusion: 理论分析表明，在翻译学习的早期阶段，交互可能不是必要且效率不高，仅通过英语输出就能有效评估翻译器质量。

Abstract: If you had an AI Whale-to-English translator, how could you validate whether
or not it is working? Does one need to interact with the animals or rely on
grounded observations such as temperature? We provide theoretical and
proof-of-concept experimental evidence suggesting that interaction and even
observations may not be necessary for sufficiently complex languages. One may
be able to evaluate translators solely by their English outputs, offering
potential advantages in terms of safety, ethics, and cost. This is an instance
of machine translation quality evaluation (MTQE) without any reference
translations available. A key challenge is identifying ``hallucinations,''
false translations which may appear fluent and plausible. We propose using
segment-by-segment translation together with the classic NLP shuffle test to
evaluate translators. The idea is to translate animal communication, turn by
turn, and evaluate how often the resulting translations make more sense in
order than permuted. Proof-of-concept experiments on data-scarce human
languages and constructed languages demonstrate the potential utility of this
evaluation methodology. These human-language experiments serve solely to
validate our reference-free metric under data scarcity. It is found to
correlate highly with a standard evaluation based on reference translations,
which are available in our experiments. We also perform a theoretical analysis
suggesting that interaction may not be necessary nor efficient in the early
stages of learning to translate.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文通过构建一个单层Transformer玩具模型，揭示了语言模型中真假陈述线性子空间的形成机制，发现这种表示可以通过事实陈述的共现模式自然涌现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明大语言模型存在区分真假陈述的线性子空间，但其形成机制尚不明确。本文旨在通过构建透明模型来揭示这种真理表示的具体形成路径。

Method: 构建一个单层Transformer玩具模型，研究在事实陈述共现的数据分布下，模型如何通过学习真假区分来降低语言建模损失。

Result: 实验发现模型学习呈现两阶段动态：先快速记忆个体事实关联，然后长时间学习线性区分真假陈述，从而降低语言建模损失。

Conclusion: 研究提供了线性真理表示在语言模型中涌现的机制性演示和实证动机，解释了这种表示如何以及为何会在语言模型中形成。

Abstract: Recent probing studies reveal that large language models exhibit linear
subspaces that separate true from false statements, yet the mechanism behind
their emergence is unclear. We introduce a transparent, one-layer transformer
toy model that reproduces such truth subspaces end-to-end and exposes one
concrete route by which they can arise. We study one simple setting in which
truth encoding can emerge: a data distribution where factual statements
co-occur with other factual statements (and vice-versa), encouraging the model
to learn this distinction in order to lower the LM loss on future tokens. We
corroborate this pattern with experiments in pretrained language models.
Finally, in the toy setting we observe a two-phase learning dynamic: networks
first memorize individual factual associations in a few steps, then -- over a
longer horizon -- learn to linearly separate true from false, which in turn
lowers language-modeling loss. Together, these results provide both a
mechanistic demonstration and an empirical motivation for how and why linear
truth representations can emerge in language models.

TL;DR: Paper2Web是一个用于评估学术网页生成的基准数据集和多维评估框架，同时提出了PWAgent，一个将科学论文转换为交互式多媒体学术首页的自主流水线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前学术项目网站在有效传播研究方面存在不足，现有的LLM生成、模板或HTML转换方法难以产生具有布局感知和交互性的网站，且缺乏全面的评估套件。

Method: 提出了Paper2Web基准数据集，包含基于规则的指标（连通性、完整性）、人类验证的LLM评估（交互性、美观性、信息性）和PaperQuiz（测量论文级知识保留）。同时开发了PWAgent自主流水线，通过MCP工具迭代优化内容和布局。

Result: 实验表明PWAgent显著优于基于模板的网页和arXiv/alphaXiv版本等端到端基线方法，在保持低成本的同时实现了学术网页生成的帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: Paper2Web为学术网页生成提供了全面的评估框架，PWAgent能够高效地将科学论文转换为交互式多媒体学术首页，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Academic project websites can more effectively disseminate research when they
clearly present core content and enable intuitive navigation and interaction.
However, current approaches such as direct Large Language Model (LLM)
generation, templates, or direct HTML conversion struggle to produce
layout-aware, interactive sites, and a comprehensive evaluation suite for this
task has been lacking. In this paper, we introduce Paper2Web, a benchmark
dataset and multi-dimensional evaluation framework for assessing academic
webpage generation. It incorporates rule-based metrics like Connectivity,
Completeness and human-verified LLM-as-a-Judge (covering interactivity,
aesthetics, and informativeness), and PaperQuiz, which measures paper-level
knowledge retention. We further present PWAgent, an autonomous pipeline that
converts scientific papers into interactive and multimedia-rich academic
homepages. The agent iteratively refines both content and layout through MCP
tools that enhance emphasis, balance, and presentation quality. Our experiments
show that PWAgent consistently outperforms end-to-end baselines like
template-based webpages and arXiv/alphaXiv versions by a large margin while
maintaining low cost, achieving the Pareto-front in academic webpage
generation.

Motivation: 由于非正式和领域特定语言，准确检测产品评论和社交媒体帖子中的情感极性和强度仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 使用VADER进行初始情感估计，通过DistilBERT的置信度分数和模糊逻辑进行两阶段调整，最后通过自定义模糊推理系统将分数映射到0-1连续区间。

Result: 在四个领域特定数据集（外卖、电商、旅游、时尚）上评估，结果显示与用户评分更一致，能更好识别情感极端值，减少误分类。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了将符号推理与神经模型相结合在语言动态领域中进行可解释、细粒度情感分析的价值。

Abstract: Accurately detecting sentiment polarity and intensity in product reviews and
social media posts remains challenging due to informal and domain-specific
language. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid lexicon-fuzzy-transformer
framework that combines rule-based heuristics, contextual deep learning, and
fuzzy logic to generate continuous sentiment scores reflecting both polarity
and strength. The pipeline begins with VADER-based initial sentiment
estimations, which are refined through a two-stage adjustment process. This
involves leveraging confidence scores from DistilBERT, a lightweight
transformer and applying fuzzy logic principles to mitigate excessive
neutrality bias and enhance granularity. A custom fuzzy inference system then
maps the refined scores onto a 0 to 1 continuum, producing expert)like
judgments. The framework is rigorously evaluated on four domain-specific
datasets. food delivery, e-commerce, tourism, and fashion. Results show
improved alignment with user ratings, better identification of sentiment
extremes, and reduced misclassifications. Both quantitative metrics
(distributional alignment, confusion matrices) and qualitative insights (case
studies, runtime analysis) affirm the models robustness and efficiency. This
work demonstrates the value of integrating symbolic reasoning with neural
models for interpretable, finegrained sentiment analysis in linguistically
dynamic domains.

Conclusion: 通过系统性的改进方法，可以有效缩小基于语音大语言模型的槽位填充系统与经验上界之间的性能差距，为实际应用提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Slot filling is a crucial subtask in spoken language understanding (SLU),
traditionally implemented as a cascade of speech recognition followed by one or
more natural language understanding (NLU) components. The recent advent of
speech-based large language models (speechLLMs), which integrate speech and
textual foundation models, has opened new avenues for achieving speech
understanding tasks in a more unified, generative, and instruction-following
manner while promising data and compute efficiency with zero-shot abilities,
generalizing to unseen slot labels. We address the slot-filling task by
creating an empirical upper bound for the task, identifying performance,
robustness, and generalization gaps, and proposing improvements to the training
data, architecture, and training strategies to narrow the gap with the upper
bound result. We show that each of these measures improve performance
substantially, while highlighting practical challenges and providing empirical
guidance and insights for harnessing these emerging models.

*Pengkai Wang,Qi Zuo,Pengwei Liu,Zhijie Sang,Congkai Xie,Hongxia Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ORBIT框架通过基于量规的增量强化学习，在开放领域（特别是医疗对话）中解决了奖励函数模糊的问题，将Qwen3-4B-Instruct模型在HealthBench-Hard基准上的性能从7.0提升到27.2。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习在数学和代码等有明确规则奖励的领域表现良好，但在开放领域如医疗对话中，由于奖励模糊、主观且依赖上下文，缺乏稳健的奖励函数，限制了RL策略的应用。

Method: ORBIT框架结合合成对话生成和动态量规创建，使用这些量规指导增量强化学习过程，不依赖外部医学知识或手动规则，而是通过量规引导的反馈来塑造学习。

Result: 在Qwen3-4B-Instruct模型上实施ORBIT，仅使用2k样本就将HealthBench-Hard基准性能从7.0大幅提升至27.2，达到了该规模模型的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 量规驱动的强化学习在多样化咨询场景中促进了一致的性能提升，超越了简单的数值改进，强调了基于量规的反馈作为在复杂开放任务中推进LLM的可扩展策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown substantial advances through
reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in domains where rewards can be
programmatically verified, such as mathematics and code. In these areas, models
benefit from a well-defined operational base guided by explicit rule-based
objectives. However, this progress reveals a significant limitation: in
open-ended domains where rewards are ambiguous, subjective, or
context-dependent, such as creative writing, scientific reasoning, and notably
medical consultation, robust reward functions are lacking, making these areas
challenging for current RL strategies. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORBIT,
an open-ended rubric-based incremental training framework specifically designed
for high-stakes medical dialogue. ORBIT integrates syn- thetic dialogue
generation with the dynamic creation of rubrics, employing these rubrics to
direct an incremental RL process. In particular, this approach does not depend
on external medical knowledge or manual rules, instead utilizing rubric-guided
feedback to shape learning. When implemented on the Qwen3-4B-Instruct model,
our method can greatly enhance its performance on the HealthBench-Hard
benchmark from 7.0 to 27.2 using only 2k samples, thus achieving
state-of-the-art results for models of this scale. Our analysis confirms that
rubric-driven RL fos-ters consistent performance gains across diverse
consultation scenarios, going beyond simple numerical improvements. These
findings underscore rubric-based feedback as a scalable strategy for advancing
LLMs in intricate, open-ended tasks.

TL;DR: PolySkill框架通过将技能的目标与实现解耦，使智能体能够学习可泛化和组合的技能，在网页交互中显著提升技能重用率和成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法学习的技能往往过度专门化于单个网站，缺乏泛化能力，需要一种能够学习跨网站通用技能的方法。

Method: 受软件工程中多态性启发，将技能的抽象目标（做什么）与具体实现（怎么做）解耦，使智能体能够识别和提炼自己的目标。

Result: 在已见网站上技能重用率提高1.7倍，在Mind2Web和未见网站上成功率分别提升9.4%和13.9%，同时减少20%以上的步骤。

Conclusion: 将技能目标与执行分离是开发能够在开放网络中持续学习和泛化的自主智能体的关键步骤。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are moving beyond static uses and are now
powering agents that learn continually during their interaction with external
environments. For example, agents can learn reusable skills while navigating
web pages or toggling new tools. However, existing methods for skill learning
often create skills that are over-specialized to a single website and fail to
generalize. We introduce PolySkill, a new framework that enables agents to
learn generalizable and compositional skills. The core idea, inspired by
polymorphism in software engineering, is to decouple a skill's abstract goal
(what it accomplishes) and its concrete implementation (how it is executed).
Experiments show that our method (1) improves skill reuse by 1.7x on seen
websites and (2) boosts success rates by up to 9.4% on Mind2Web and 13.9% on
unseen websites, while reducing steps by over 20%. (3) In self-exploration
settings without specified tasks, our framework improves the quality of
proposed tasks and enables agents to learn generalizable skills that work
across different sites. By enabling the agent to identify and refine its own
goals, the PolySkill enhances the agent's ability to learn a better curriculum,
leading to the acquisition of more generalizable skills compared to baseline
methods. This work provides a practical path toward building agents capable of
continual learning in adaptive environments. Our findings show that separating
a skill's goal from its execution is a crucial step toward developing
autonomous agents that can learn and generalize across the open web
continuously.

Conclusion: 理解用户在元宇宙游戏中的参与度将有助于设计优先考虑安全性和包容性的未来VR环境

Abstract: Educating children and young people to be safe online is essential,
especially as the metaverse, a next-generation internet blending immersive
technologies, promises to reshape their interactions and amplify their
experiences. While virtual reality offers fully immersive, highly interactive,
and multi-sensory engagement, it also heightens cyber harm risks for young or
vulnerable users. To address this, the CyberNinjas VR experience was developed
to educate children aged 8 to 16 on safe metaverse behaviours, providing clear
referral steps for harmful interactions. Understanding user engagement in
metaverse gaming will aid the design of future VR environments which prioritize
safety and inclusivity. This project analyses CyberNinjas to understand how
game mechanics can foster cyber-safe behaviours.

Conclusion: 多级预测系统成功解决了节点负荷预测的挑战，为电网运营商提供了更可靠和可管理的预测工具，支持可持续能源发展下的电网稳定运行。

Abstract: The reliability of local power grid infrastructure is challenged by
sustainable energy developments increasing electric load uncertainty.
Transmission System Operators (TSOs) need load forecasts of higher spatial
resolution, extending current forecasting operations from zonal aggregates to
individual nodes. However, nodal loads are less accurate to forecast and
require a large number of individual forecasts, which are hard to manage for
the human experts assessing risks in the control room's daily operations
(operator). In collaboration with a TSO, we design a multi-level system that
meets the needs of operators for hourly day-ahead load forecasting. Utilizing a
uniquely extensive dataset of zonal and nodal net loads, we experimentally
evaluate our system components. First, we develop an interpretable and scalable
forecasting model that allows for TSOs to gradually extend zonal operations to
include nodal forecasts. Second, we evaluate solutions to address the
heterogeneity and volatility of nodal load, subject to a trade-off. Third, our
system is manageable with a fully parallelized single-model forecasting
workflow. Our results show accuracy and interpretability improvements for zonal
forecasts, and substantial improvements for nodal forecasts. In practice, our
multi-level forecasting system allows operators to adjust forecasts with
unprecedented confidence and accuracy, and to diagnose otherwise opaque errors
precisely.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征选择方法主要关注预测准确性，但在存在相关预测变量的情况下性能会下降，需要一种能够处理相关特征空间的方法。

Method: TangledFeatures框架识别纠缠预测变量组中的代表性特征，减少冗余同时保留解释能力。

Result: 在Alanine Dipeptide数据集上应用该框架预测主链扭转角，所选特征对应于结构上有意义的原子间距离，能够解释这些角度的变化。

Conclusion: TangledFeatures提供比传统选择技术更可解释和稳定的分析基础，可直接应用于下游模型。

Abstract: Feature selection is a fundamental step in model development, shaping both
predictive performance and interpretability. Yet, most widely used methods
focus on predictive accuracy, and their performance degrades in the presence of
correlated predictors. To address this gap, we introduce TangledFeatures, a
framework for feature selection in correlated feature spaces. It identifies
representative features from groups of entangled predictors, reducing
redundancy while retaining explanatory power. The resulting feature subset can
be directly applied in downstream models, offering a more interpretable and
stable basis for analysis compared to traditional selection techniques. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of TangledFeatures on Alanine Dipeptide, applying
it to the prediction of backbone torsional angles and show that the selected
features correspond to structurally meaningful intra-atomic distances that
explain variation in these angles.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究提出了ES-C51算法，通过将C51中的贪婪Q学习更新替换为Expected Sarsa更新，解决了当多个动作具有相似期望奖励但不同分布时的不稳定问题，在多个环境中表现优于QL-C51。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于值的强化学习算法只估计每个动作的期望奖励，而分布强化学习估计整个奖励概率分布。C51算法使用贪婪Bellman更新可能导致当多个动作具有相似期望奖励但不同分布时学习不稳定。

Method: 提出ES-C51算法，用Expected Sarsa更新替代C51中的贪婪Q学习更新，使用softmax计算结合状态中所有可能动作的信息，而不是依赖单一最佳动作。

Result: 在Gym经典控制环境和Atari-10游戏中评估，ES-C51在多个环境中表现优于QL-C51（将标准C51探索策略从ε-greedy改为softmax的版本）。

Conclusion: ES-C51通过Expected Sarsa更新减少了动作具有相似期望奖励时的不稳定性，使智能体能够学习更高性能的策略。

Abstract: In most value-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, the agent
estimates only the expected reward for each action and selects the action with
the highest reward. In contrast, Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
estimates the entire probability distribution of possible rewards, providing
richer information about uncertainty and variability. C51 is a popular DRL
algorithm for discrete action spaces. It uses a Q-learning approach, where the
distribution is learned using a greedy Bellman update. However, this can cause
problems if multiple actions at a state have similar expected reward but with
different distributions, as the algorithm may not learn a stable distribution.
This study presents a modified version of C51 (ES-C51) that replaces the greedy
Q-learning update with an Expected Sarsa update, which uses a softmax
calculation to combine information from all possible actions at a state rather
than relying on a single best action. This reduces instability when actions
have similar expected rewards and allows the agent to learn higher-performing
policies. This approach is evaluated on classic control environments from Gym,
and Atari-10 games. For a fair comparison, we modify the standard C51's
exploration strategy from e-greedy to softmax, which we refer to as QL-C51 (Q-
Learning based C51). The results demonstrate that ES-C51 outperforms QL-C51
across many environments.

Abstract: Poultry farming faces increasing pressure to meet productivity targets while
ensuring animal welfare and environmental compliance. Yet many small and
medium-sized farms lack affordable, integrated tools for continuous monitoring
and decision-making, relying instead on manual, reactive inspections. This
paper presents Poultry Farm Intelligence (PoultryFI) - a modular,
cost-effective platform that integrates six AI-powered modules: Camera
Placement Optimizer, Audio-Visual Monitoring, Analytics & Alerting, Real-Time
Egg Counting, Production & Profitability Forecasting, and a Recommendation
Module.
  Camera layouts are first optimized offline using evolutionary algorithms for
full poultry house coverage with minimal hardware. The Audio-Visual Monitoring
module extracts welfare indicators from synchronized video, audio, and feeding
data. Analytics & Alerting produces daily summaries and real-time
notifications, while Real-Time Egg Counting uses an edge vision model to
automate production tracking. Forecasting models predict egg yield and feed
consumption up to 10 days in advance, and the Recommendation Module integrates
forecasts with weather data to guide environmental and operational adjustments.
  This is among the first systems to combine low-cost sensing, edge analytics,
and prescriptive AI to continuously monitor flocks, predict production, and
optimize performance. Field trials demonstrate 100% egg-count accuracy on
Raspberry Pi 5, robust anomaly detection, and reliable short-term forecasting.
PoultryFI bridges the gap between isolated pilot tools and scalable, farm-wide
intelligence, empowering producers to proactively safeguard welfare and
profitability.

Abstract: Wind turbine reliability is critical to the growing renewable energy sector,
where early fault detection significantly reduces downtime and maintenance
costs. This paper introduces a novel ensemble-based deep learning framework for
unsupervised anomaly detection in wind turbines. The method integrates
Variational Autoencoders (VAE), LSTM Autoencoders, and Transformer
architectures, each capturing different temporal and contextual patterns from
high-dimensional SCADA data. A unique feature engineering pipeline extracts
temporal, statistical, and frequency-domain indicators, which are then
processed by the deep models. Ensemble scoring combines model predictions,
followed by adaptive thresholding to detect operational anomalies without
requiring labeled fault data. Evaluated on the CARE dataset containing 89 years
of real-world turbine data across three wind farms, the proposed method
achieves an AUC-ROC of 0.947 and early fault detection up to 48 hours prior to
failure. This approach offers significant societal value by enabling predictive
maintenance, reducing turbine failures, and enhancing operational efficiency in
large-scale wind energy deployments.

Abstract: Flow-based Generative Models (FGMs) effectively transform noise into complex
data distributions. Incorporating Optimal Transport (OT) to couple noise and
data during FGM training has been shown to improve the straightness of flow
trajectories, enabling more effective inference. However, existing OT-based
methods estimate the OT plan using (mini-)batches of sampled noise and data
points, which limits their scalability to large and high-dimensional datasets
in FGMs. This paper introduces AlignFlow, a novel approach that leverages
Semi-Discrete Optimal Transport (SDOT) to enhance the training of FGMs by
establishing an explicit, optimal alignment between noise distribution and data
points with guaranteed convergence. SDOT computes a transport map by
partitioning the noise space into Laguerre cells, each mapped to a
corresponding data point. During FGM training, i.i.d. noise samples are paired
with data points via the SDOT map. AlignFlow scales well to large datasets and
model architectures with negligible computational overhead. Experimental
results show that AlignFlow improves the performance of a wide range of
state-of-the-art FGM algorithms and can be integrated as a plug-and-play
component. Code is available at: https://github.com/konglk1203/AlignFlow.

Abstract: Credit scoring is a high-stakes task in financial services, where model
decisions directly impact individuals' access to credit and are subject to
strict regulatory scrutiny. While Quantum Machine Learning (QML) offers new
computational capabilities, its black-box nature poses challenges for adoption
in domains that demand transparency and trust. In this work, we present
IQNN-CS, an interpretable quantum neural network framework designed for
multiclass credit risk classification. The architecture combines a variational
QNN with a suite of post-hoc explanation techniques tailored for structured
data. To address the lack of structured interpretability in QML, we introduce
Inter-Class Attribution Alignment (ICAA), a novel metric that quantifies
attribution divergence across predicted classes, revealing how the model
distinguishes between credit risk categories. Evaluated on two real-world

TL;DR: SPA框架通过自监督预训练学习世界模型，然后用于策略优化，显著提升LLM智能体在分布外场景中的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体在分布外场景中表现不佳，难以将内部知识与环境动态对齐，传统的强化学习训练在这种条件下效果有限

Method: 将世界模型分解为状态表示和转移建模两个组件，通过自博弈监督微调阶段冷启动策略学习世界模型，然后用于模拟未来状态以优化策略

Result: 在Sokoban、FrozenLake和Sudoku等多样化环境中显著提升性能，如Sokoban成功率从25.6%提升到59.8%，FrozenLake得分从22.1%提升到70.9%

Conclusion: 为LLM智能体配备内部世界模型可以更好地将推理与环境动态对齐，提高决策能力，SPA框架有效解决了分布外场景下的性能问题

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as agents often struggle in out-of-distribution
(OOD) scenarios. Real-world environments are complex and dynamic, governed by
task-specific rules and stochasticity, which makes it difficult for LLMs to
ground their internal knowledge in those dynamics. Under such OOD conditions,
vanilla RL training often fails to scale; we observe Pass@k--the probability
that at least one of (k) sampled trajectories succeeds--drops markedly across
training steps, indicating brittle exploration and limited generalization.
Inspired by model-based reinforcement learning, we hypothesize that equipping
LLM agents with an internal world model can better align reasoning with
environmental dynamics and improve decision-making. We show how to encode this
world model by decomposing it into two components: state representation and
transition modeling. Building on this, we introduce SPA, a simple reinforcement
learning framework that cold-starts the policy via a Self-Play supervised
finetuning (SFT) stage to learn the world model by interacting with the
environment, then uses it to simulate future states prior to policy
optimization. This simple initialization outperforms the online world-modeling
baseline and greatly boosts the RL-based agent training performance.
Experiments across diverse environments like Sokoban, FrozenLake, and Sudoku
show that our approach significantly improves performance. For example, SPA
boosts the Sokoban success rate from 25.6% to 59.8% and raises the FrozenLake
score from 22.1% to 70.9% for the Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了多层级可配置时变马尔可夫决策过程（MCTVMDP），允许智能体通过上层模型改变动作主动修改环境动态，而不仅是被动适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习假设环境固定，智能体只能被动适应。本文考虑智能体可以通过模型改变动作主动修改环境动态，从而可能获得更高奖励。

Method: 引入MCTVMDP框架，包含上层MDP配置下层MDP的转移函数，智能体需要联合优化上层配置策略和下层原始动作策略。

Result: 构建了一个允许智能体主动修改环境动态的理论框架，扩展了传统强化学习的被动适应范式。

Conclusion: MCTVMDP为研究智能体主动环境重构提供了理论基础，有望在需要环境改造的实际应用中发挥作用。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning usually assumes a given or sometimes even fixed
environment in which an agent seeks an optimal policy to maximize its long-term
discounted reward. In contrast, we consider agents that are not limited to
passive adaptations: they instead have model-changing actions that actively
modify the RL model of world dynamics itself. Reconfiguring the underlying
transition processes can potentially increase the agents' rewards. Motivated by
this setting, we introduce the multi-layer configurable time-varying Markov
decision process (MCTVMDP). In an MCTVMDP, the lower-level MDP has a
non-stationary transition function that is configurable through upper-level
model-changing actions. The agent's objective consists of two parts: Optimize
the configuration policies in the upper-level MDP and optimize the primitive
action policies in the lower-level MDP to jointly improve its expected
long-term reward.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Antislop是一个检测和消除LLM输出中重复短语模式的框架，包含采样器、自动化管道和微调方法，能显著减少AI生成文本中的模式化表达，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM广泛采用导致输出中出现特征性的重复短语模式（称为"slop"），这会降低输出质量并使AI生成文本容易被识别。

Method: 结合三种创新方法：Antislop采样器（使用回溯抑制不需要的字符串）、自动化管道（分析模型特定模式并生成训练数据）、最终令牌偏好优化（FTPO，在推理轨迹中调整单个令牌的logits）。

Result: 成功抑制8000+模式，而令牌禁止方法在2000模式时就不可用；FTPO实现90%的模式减少，同时在GSM8K、MMLU和创意写作任务中保持或提升性能。

Conclusion: Antislop框架能有效检测和消除LLM输出中的重复模式，显著提升文本质量，而DPO方法会导致写作质量和词汇多样性显著下降。

Abstract: Widespread LLM adoption has introduced characteristic repetitive phraseology,
termed ``slop,'' which degrades output quality and makes AI-generated text
immediately recognizable. We present Antislop, a comprehensive framework
providing tools to both detect and eliminate these overused patterns. Our
approach combines three innovations: (1) The Antislop Sampler, which uses
backtracking to suppress unwanted strings at inference time without destroying
vocabulary; (2) An automated pipeline that profiles model-specific slop against
human baselines and generates training data; (3) Final Token Preference
Optimization (FTPO), a novel fine-tuning method that operates on individual
tokens, surgically adjusting logits wherever a banned pattern has appeared in
an inference trace. We demonstrate that some slop patterns appear over
1,000$\times$ more frequently in LLM output than human text. The Antislop
Sampler successfully suppresses 8,000+ patterns while maintaining quality,
whereas token banning becomes unusable at just 2,000. Most importantly, FTPO
achieves 90\% slop reduction while maintaining or improving performance in
cross-domain evals including GSM8K, MMLU, and creative writing tasks. In
contrast, DPO suffers significant degradation in writing quality and lexical
diversity despite achieving weaker suppression. We release all code and results

TL;DR: 本文提出了三种基于物理信息数据驱动预测模型和统计方法的两光子光刻系统健康监测方法，能够准确及时地监控机器健康状况，实现基于状态的维护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前两光子光刻系统的维护实践主要依赖经验而非机器健康监测，导致维护时机不当——要么维护不及时造成停机和质量问题，要么维护过度导致效率低下和不必要的停机。

Method: 通过整合物理信息数据驱动的结构尺寸预测模型与统计方法，提出了三种能够处理不同泛化水平复杂场景的健康监测方法。

Result: 在包含6种工艺参数组合和6种结构尺寸的全面实验数据集上，所有测试场景中都实现了高精度，表现出优秀的有效性、鲁棒性和泛化性。

Conclusion: 这些结果为两光子光刻系统实现基于状态的维护迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Two-photon lithography (TPL) is a sophisticated additive manufacturing
technology for creating three-dimensional (3D) micro- and nano-structures.
Maintaining the health of TPL systems is critical for ensuring consistent
fabrication quality. Current maintenance practices often rely on experience
rather than informed monitoring of machine health, resulting in either untimely
maintenance that causes machine downtime and poor-quality fabrication, or
unnecessary maintenance that leads to inefficiencies and avoidable downtime. To
address this gap, this paper presents three methods for accurate and timely
monitoring of TPL machine health. Through integrating physics-informed
data-driven predictive models for structure dimensions with statistical
approaches, the proposed methods are able to handle increasingly complex
scenarios featuring different levels of generalizability. A comprehensive
experimental dataset that encompasses six process parameter combinations and
six structure dimensions under two machine health conditions was collected to
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Across all test
scenarios, the approaches are shown to achieve high accuracies, demonstrating
excellent effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability. These results
represent a significant step toward condition-based maintenance for TPL
systems.

*Sami Davies,Benjamin Moseley,Heather Newman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个在线相关聚类算法，能在单一聚类中同时近似所有ℓ_p-范数目标，将离线的"全范数"保证成功扩展到在线设置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ℓ_p-范数目标在相关聚类中的权衡：ℓ₁-范数最小化总分歧，ℓ_∞-范数确保对单个节点的公平性。离线设置中可同时近似所有范数，但标准随机顺序在线模型存在根本性分离，需要超越最坏情况的模型。

Method: 在带样本的在线(AOS)模型中，给定输入的一小部分常数比例作为样本，设计单一算法产生一个聚类。

Result: 算法高概率下对所有ℓ_p-范数同时达到O(log⁴n)竞争比，对ℓ_∞-范数高概率达到O(logn)竞争比，对ℓ₁-范数期望下达到O(1)竞争比。

Conclusion: 成功将离线的"全范数"保证转移到在线世界，证明了AOS模型的必要性，并提供了接近紧的下界。

Abstract: The $\ell_p$-norm objectives for correlation clustering present a fundamental
trade-off between minimizing total disagreements (the $\ell_1$-norm) and
ensuring fairness to individual nodes (the $\ell_\infty$-norm). Surprisingly,
in the offline setting it is possible to simultaneously approximate all
$\ell_p$-norms with a single clustering. Can this powerful guarantee be
achieved in an online setting? This paper provides the first affirmative
answer. We present a single algorithm for the online-with-a-sample (AOS) model
that, given a small constant fraction of the input as a sample, produces one
clustering that is simultaneously $O(\log^4 n)$-competitive for all
$\ell_p$-norms with high probability, $O(\log n)$-competitive for the
$\ell_\infty$-norm with high probability, and $O(1)$-competitive for the
$\ell_1$-norm in expectation. This work successfully translates the offline
"all-norms" guarantee to the online world.
  Our setting is motivated by a new hardness result that demonstrates a
fundamental separation between these objectives in the standard random-order
(RO) online model. Namely, while the $\ell_1$-norm is trivially
$O(1)$-approximable in the RO model, we prove that any algorithm in the RO
model for the fairness-promoting $\ell_\infty$-norm must have a competitive
ratio of at least $\Omega(n^{1/3})$. This highlights the necessity of a
different beyond-worst-case model. We complement our algorithm with lower
bounds, showing our competitive ratios for the $\ell_1$- and $\ell_\infty$-
norms are nearly tight in the AOS model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归和基于扩散的方法在预测高维PDE动力学时存在累积误差和离散化伪影问题，限制了长期物理一致性预测。流匹配提供了一种高效的确定性采样替代方案。

Method: 提出TempO模型，采用潜在流匹配方法，利用稀疏条件化和通道折叠技术，通过时间条件傅里叶层高效处理3D时空场，准确捕捉多尺度模式。

Result: TempO在三个基准PDE数据集上优于现有最先进基线方法，谱分析显示其能更好地恢复多尺度动力学，效率研究表明其参数和内存需求低于基于注意力或卷积的回归器。

Conclusion: TempO通过流匹配和创新的稀疏条件化技术，实现了对高维PDE动力学的高效、准确预测，在长期物理一致性预测方面表现出色。

Abstract: Forecasting high-dimensional, PDE-governed dynamics remains a core challenge
for generative modeling. Existing autoregressive and diffusion-based approaches
often suffer cumulative errors and discretisation artifacts that limit long,
physically consistent forecasts. Flow matching offers a natural alternative,
enabling efficient, deterministic sampling. We prove an upper bound on FNO
approximation error and propose TempO, a latent flow matching model leveraging
sparse conditioning with channel folding to efficiently process 3D
spatiotemporal fields using time-conditioned Fourier layers to capture
multi-scale modes with high fidelity. TempO outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines across three benchmark PDE datasets, and spectral analysis further
demonstrates superior recovery of multi-scale dynamics, while efficiency
studies highlight its parameter- and memory-light design compared to
attention-based or convolutional regressors.

TL;DR: DLER通过改进强化学习优化方法，使用简单的截断长度惩罚，在保持高准确率的同时显著缩短推理语言模型的输出长度，实现了最先进的准确率-效率权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理语言模型（如OpenAI-o1、DeepSeek-R1等）虽然性能强大，但生成了不必要的冗长输出，最大化每个token的智能（准确率相对于响应长度）仍是一个未解决的问题。

Method: 提出DLER训练方法，结合批次奖励归一化、更高裁剪、动态采样和简单截断长度惩罚，解决强化学习优化中的三大挑战：优势估计偏差大、熵崩溃和稀疏奖励信号。

Result: DLER将输出长度减少70%以上，同时超越所有先前基线准确率。DLER-7B相比DeepSeek-R1-7B，并行生成多个简洁响应时准确率提高28%，延迟更低。

Conclusion: DLER证明了通过改进强化学习优化而非复杂惩罚机制，可以实现高效的准确率-效率权衡，并提出了难度感知DLER和更新选择性合并方法以进一步提升效率和应用灵活性。

Abstract: Reasoning language models such as OpenAI-o1, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen achieve
strong performance via extended chains of thought but often generate
unnecessarily long outputs. Maximizing intelligence per token--accuracy
relative to response length--remains an open problem. We revisit reinforcement
learning (RL) with the simplest length penalty--truncation--and show that
accuracy degradation arises not from the lack of sophisticated penalties but
from inadequate RL optimization. We identify three key challenges: (i) large
bias in advantage estimation, (ii) entropy collapse, and (iii) sparse reward
signal. We address them with Doing Length pEnalty Right (DLER), a training
recipe combining batch-wise reward normalization, higher clipping, dynamic
sampling, and a simple truncation length penalty. DLER achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy--efficiency trade-offs, cutting output length by over
70 percent while surpassing all previous baseline accuracy. It also improves
test-time scaling: compared to DeepSeek-R1-7B, DLER-7B generates multiple
concise responses in parallel with 28 percent higher accuracy and lower
latency. We further introduce Difficulty-Aware DLER, which adaptively tightens
truncation on easier questions for additional efficiency gains. We also propose
an update-selective merging method that preserves baseline accuracy while
retaining the concise reasoning ability of the DLER model, which is useful for
scenarios where RL training data is scarce.

Abstract: Identifying the effects of mechanical ventilation strategies and protocols in
critical care requires analyzing data from heterogeneous patient-ventilator
systems within the context of the clinical decision-making environment. This
research develops a framework to help understand the consequences of mechanical
ventilation (MV) and adjunct care decisions on patient outcome from
observations of critical care patients receiving MV. Developing an
understanding of and improving critical care respiratory management requires
the analysis of existing secondary-use clinical data to generate hypotheses
about advantageous variations and adaptations of current care. This work
introduces a perspective of the joint patient-ventilator-care systems
(so-called J6) to develop a scalable method for analyzing data and trajectories
of these complex systems. To that end, breath behaviors are analyzed using
evolutionary game theory (EGT), which generates the necessary quantitative
precursors for deeper analysis through probabilistic and stochastic machinery
such as reinforcement learning. This result is one step along the pathway
toward MV optimization and personalization. The EGT-based process is
analytically validated on synthetic data to reveal potential caveats before
proceeding to real-world ICU data applications that expose complexities of the
data-generating process J6. The discussion includes potential developments
toward a state transition model for the simulating effects of MV decision using
empirical and game-theoretic elements.

*Alex Shtoff*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于图拉普拉斯算子的非参数概率质量函数估计方法，通过数据依赖的低通滤波处理多模态和重尾分布，计算高效且无需过多调参。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在大离散支撑集上估计多模态和重尾概率质量函数的问题，传统方法在处理这类分布时存在困难。

Method: 将经验PMF视为线图上的信号，构建对称三对角算子（路径图拉普拉斯算子扰动），计算最小特征值对应的特征向量，将经验PMF投影到低维子空间，最后进行裁剪和重归一化处理。

Result: 在合成和真实重尾数据上，该方法能保持粗粒度结构同时抑制采样噪声，在目标场景下优于logspline和高斯KDE基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法实现简洁、计算可靠快速、对样本量鲁棒，适合自动化流程和大规模探索性分析，但存在已知的失效模式（如突然的不连续性）。

Abstract: We study nonparametric estimation of a probability mass function (PMF) on a
large discrete support, where the PMF is multi-modal and heavy-tailed. The core
idea is to treat the empirical PMF as a signal on a line graph and apply a
data-dependent low-pass filter. Concretely, we form a symmetric tri-diagonal
operator, the path graph Laplacian perturbed with a diagonal matrix built from
the empirical PMF, then compute the eigenvectors, corresponding to the smallest
feq eigenvalues. Projecting the empirical PMF onto this low dimensional
subspace produces a smooth, multi-modal estimate that preserves coarse
structure while suppressing noise. A light post-processing step of clipping and
re-normalizing yields a valid PMF.
  Because we compute the eigenpairs of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix, the
computation is reliable and runs time and memory proportional to the support
times the dimension of the desired low-dimensional supspace. We also provide a
practical, data-driven rule for selecting the dimension based on an
orthogonal-series risk estimate, so the method "just works" with minimal
tuning. On synthetic and real heavy-tailed examples, the approach preserves
coarse structure while suppressing sampling noise, compares favorably to
logspline and Gaussian-KDE baselines in the intended regimes. However, it has
known failure modes (e.g., abrupt discontinuities). The method is short to
implement, robust across sample sizes, and suitable for automated pipelines and
exploratory analysis at scale because of its reliability and speed.

Result: BiLSTM在测试集上表现最佳，RMSE为6.38，显著优于LSTM-Attention(9.19)和线性滞后回归基线。消融实验表明：长历史数据训练模型泛化最好；中等回望窗口(20-30周)提供强上下文；双向编码对捕获窗口内的积累和后续模式至关重要；滞后计数和滚动统计特征贡献最大。

Conclusion: 该研究为GTD事件预测提供了一个透明、超越基线的参考框架，强调双向编码在捕获时间模式中的重要性，并发布了代码、配置和紧凑结果表，附带数据/伦理声明。

Abstract: We study short-horizon forecasting of weekly terrorism incident counts using
the Global Terrorism Database (GTD, 1970--2016). We build a reproducible
pipeline with fixed time-based splits and evaluate a Bidirectional LSTM
(BiLSTM) against strong classical anchors (seasonal-naive, linear/ARIMA) and a
deep LSTM-Attention baseline. On the held-out test set, the BiLSTM attains RMSE
6.38, outperforming LSTM-Attention (9.19; +30.6\%) and a linear lag-regression
baseline (+35.4\% RMSE gain), with parallel improvements in MAE and MAPE.
Ablations varying temporal memory, training-history length, spatial grain,
lookback size, and feature groups show that models trained on long historical
data generalize best; a moderate lookback (20--30 weeks) provides strong
context; and bidirectional encoding is critical for capturing both build-up and
aftermath patterns within the window. Feature-group analysis indicates that
short-horizon structure (lagged counts and rolling statistics) contributes
most, with geographic and casualty features adding incremental lift. We release
code, configs, and compact result tables, and provide a data/ethics statement
documenting GTD licensing and research-only use. Overall, the study offers a
transparent, baseline-beating reference for GTD incident forecasting.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables agents to learn optimal decision-making
strategies through interaction with an environment, yet training from scratch
on complex tasks can be highly inefficient. Transfer learning (TL), widely
successful in large language models (LLMs), offers a promising direction for
enhancing RL efficiency by leveraging pre-trained models.
  This paper investigates policy transfer, a TL approach that initializes
learning in a target RL task using a policy from a related source task, in the
context of continuous-time linear quadratic regulators (LQRs) with entropy
regularization. We provide the first theoretical proof of policy transfer for
continuous-time RL, proving that a policy optimal for one LQR serves as a
near-optimal initialization for closely related LQRs, while preserving the
original algorithm's convergence rate. Furthermore, we introduce a novel policy
learning algorithm for continuous-time LQRs that achieves global linear and
local super-linear convergence. Our results demonstrate both theoretical
guarantees and algorithmic benefits of transfer learning in continuous-time RL,
addressing a gap in existing literature and extending prior work from discrete
to continuous time settings.
  As a byproduct of our analysis, we derive the stability of a class of
continuous-time score-based diffusion models via their connection with LQRs.

Abstract: Feature learning (FL), where neural networks adapt their internal
representations during training, remains poorly understood. Using methods from
statistical physics, we derive a tractable, self-consistent mean-field (MF)
theory for the Bayesian posterior of two-layer non-linear networks trained with
stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD). At infinite width, this theory
reduces to kernel ridge regression, but at finite width it predicts a symmetry
breaking phase transition where networks abruptly align with target functions.
While the basic MF theory provides theoretical insight into the emergence of FL
in the finite-width regime, semi-quantitatively predicting the onset of FL with
noise or sample size, it substantially underestimates the improvements in
generalisation after the transition. We trace this discrepancy to a key
mechanism absent from the plain MF description: \textit{self-reinforcing input
feature selection}. Incorporating this mechanism into the MF theory allows us
to quantitatively match the learning curves of SGLD-trained networks and
provides mechanistic insight into FL.

Abstract: Geodesic problems involve computing trajectories between prescribed initial
and final states to minimize a user-defined measure of distance, cost, or
energy. They arise throughout physics and engineering -- for instance, in
determining optimal paths through complex environments, modeling light
propagation in refractive media, and the study of spacetime trajectories in
control theory and general relativity. Despite their ubiquity, the scientific
machine learning (SciML) community has given relatively little attention to
investigating its methods in the context of these problems. In this work, we
argue that given their simple geometry, variational structure, and natural
nonlinearity, geodesic problems are particularly well-suited for the Deep Ritz
method. We substantiate this claim with three numerical examples drawn from
path planning, optics, and solid mechanics. Our goal is not to provide an
exhaustive study of geodesic problems, but rather to identify a promising
application of the Deep Ritz method and a fruitful direction for future SciML
research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统髋部骨折风险评估工具如DXA T-score和FRAX缺乏敏感性，特别是对于无既往骨折史或骨量减少的高风险人群，需要更准确的早期风险评估方法。

Method: 采用顺序两阶段模型：第一阶段使用临床、人口统计学和功能变量进行筛查，第二阶段结合DXA影像特征进行精炼，使用MrOS、SOF和UK Biobank数据集进行验证。

Result: 模型经过内部和外部验证，在不同队列中表现一致且适应性强，相比T-score和FRAX实现了更高的敏感性和更少的漏诊病例。

Conclusion: 该两阶段框架提供了一种成本效益高且个性化的早期髋部骨折风险评估方法，能够更有效地识别高风险个体。

Abstract: Hip fractures are a major cause of disability, mortality, and healthcare
burden in older adults, underscoring the need for early risk assessment.
However, commonly used tools such as the DXA T-score and FRAX often lack
sensitivity and miss individuals at high risk, particularly those without prior
fractures or with osteopenia. To address this limitation, we propose a
sequential two-stage model that integrates clinical and imaging information to
improve prediction accuracy. Using data from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men
Study (MrOS), the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), and the UK Biobank,
Stage 1 (Screening) employs clinical, demographic, and functional variables to
estimate baseline risk, while Stage 2 (Imaging) incorporates DXA-derived
features for refinement. The model was rigorously validated through internal
and external testing, showing consistent performance and adaptability across
cohorts. Compared to T-score and FRAX, the two-stage framework achieved higher
sensitivity and reduced missed cases, offering a cost-effective and
personalized approach for early hip fracture risk assessment.

TL;DR: 本研究探索了基于机器学习的替代模型在汽车碰撞结构变形预测中的应用，使用NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo框架比较了MeshGraphNet和Transolver两种神经网络架构，以及三种瞬态动力学建模策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的高保真有限元仿真计算成本高、耗时长，需要开发更高效的碰撞安全性评估方法。

Method: 使用MeshGraphNet和Transolver两种神经网络架构，结合时间条件、标准自回归和稳定性增强自回归三种策略，基于包含150个详细FE仿真的BIW碰撞数据集进行建模。

Result: 模型能够以合理保真度捕捉整体变形趋势，虽然尚未达到完整FE仿真的精度，但计算成本降低了数个数量级。

Conclusion: 机器学习在结构碰撞动力学中的应用具有可行性，能够实现快速设计探索和早期优化，为碰撞安全性评估提供了高效替代方案。

Abstract: Crashworthiness assessment is a critical aspect of automotive design,
traditionally relying on high-fidelity finite element (FE) simulations that are
computationally expensive and time-consuming. This work presents an exploratory
comparative study on developing machine learning-based surrogate models for
efficient prediction of structural deformation in crash scenarios using the
NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo framework. Given the limited prior work applying machine
learning to structural crash dynamics, the primary contribution lies in
demonstrating the feasibility and engineering utility of the various modeling
approaches explored in this work. We investigate two state-of-the-art neural
network architectures for modeling crash dynamics: MeshGraphNet, and
Transolver. Additionally, we examine three strategies for modeling transient
dynamics: time-conditional, the standard Autoregressive approach, and a
stability-enhanced Autoregressive scheme incorporating rollout-based training.
The models are evaluated on a comprehensive Body-in-White (BIW) crash dataset
comprising 150 detailed FE simulations using LS-DYNA. The dataset represents a
structurally rich vehicle assembly with over 200 components, including 38 key
components featuring variable thickness distributions to capture realistic
manufacturing variability. Each model utilizes the undeformed mesh geometry and
component characteristics as inputs to predict the spatiotemporal evolution of
the deformed mesh during the crash sequence. Evaluation results show that the
models capture the overall deformation trends with reasonable fidelity,
demonstrating the feasibility of applying machine learning to structural crash
dynamics. Although not yet matching full FE accuracy, the models achieve
orders-of-magnitude reductions in computational cost, enabling rapid design
exploration and early-stage optimization in crashworthiness evaluation.

*Denis Janiak,Jakub Binkowski,Tomasz Kajdanowicz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过实证研究发现Mahalanobis距离方法在OOD检测中并非普遍可靠，定义了理想的数据表示几何结构，并提出径向缩放ℓ2归一化方法，通过调整特征空间的径向几何结构显著提升OOD检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Mahalanobis距离方法被广泛用于OOD检测，但表示几何结构和归一化对其性能的影响尚未被充分理解，这可能限制其下游应用。

Method: 在多种图像基础模型、数据集和距离归一化方案上进行了全面的实证研究，定义了理想表示几何结构，并提出了径向缩放ℓ2归一化方法，通过可调参数直接控制特征空间的径向几何结构。

Result: 研究表明Mahalanobis方法并非普遍可靠；光谱和内在维度指标能准确预测模型的OOD性能；径向缩放ℓ2归一化能系统性地收缩或扩展表示，显著改善OOD检测性能。

Conclusion: 通过弥合表示几何结构、归一化和OOD性能之间的差距，为设计更有效可靠的深度学习模型提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the reliable deployment
of deep learning models. hile Mahalanobis distance methods are widely used, the
impact of representation geometry and normalization on their performance is not
fully understood, which may limit their downstream application. To address this
gap, we conducted a comprehensive empirical study across diverse image
foundation models, datasets, and distance normalization schemes. First, our
analysis shows that Mahalanobis-based methods aren't universally reliable.
Second, we define the ideal geometry for data representations and demonstrate
that spectral and intrinsic-dimensionality metrics can accurately predict a
model's OOD performance. Finally, we analyze how normalization impacts OOD
performance. Building upon these studies, we propose radially scaled $\ell_2$
normalization, a method that generalizes the standard $\ell_2$ normalization
recently applied to Mahalanobis-based OOD detection. Our approach introduces a
tunable parameter to directly control the radial geometry of the feature space,
systematically contracting or expanding representations to significantly
improve OOD detection performance. By bridging the gap between representation
geometry, normalization, and OOD performance, our findings offer new insights
into the design of more effective and reliable deep learning models.

*Yongchan Kwon,Shang Zhu,Federico Bianchi,Kaitlyn Zhou,James Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了ReasonIF基准来评估大型推理模型在推理过程中遵循用户指令的能力，发现现有模型在这方面表现不佳，并通过推理指令微调方法显著提升了指令遵循能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要评估模型主要输出的指令遵循能力，但推理过程中的指令遵循对于模型的可控性、透明性和安全性同样重要，需要专门评估。

Method: 构建ReasonIF基准，包含多语言推理、格式控制和长度控制等六类指令提示；提出推理指令微调(RIF)方法使用合成数据提升指令遵循能力。

Result: 现有开源LRMs的指令遵循分数普遍低于0.25，任务难度增加时表现更差；RIF方法将GPT-OSS-20B的IFS从0.11提升到0.27。

Conclusion: 推理指令遵循是LRMs的重要能力但当前表现不足，RIF方法能有效提升但仍有很大改进空间。

Abstract: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to follow user instructions is
central to their reliability, safety, and usefulness. While prior studies
assess instruction adherence in the model's main responses, we argue that it is
also critical for large reasoning models (LRMs) to follow user instructions
throughout their reasoning process. Reasoning instruction following makes LRMs
more controllable and transparent, while reducing risks of undesirable
shortcuts, hallucinations, or reward hacking within reasoning traces. To
evaluate this dimension, we introduce ReasonIF, a systematic benchmark for
assessing reasoning instruction following. ReasonIF includes six categories of
instruction prompts, spanning multilingual reasoning, formatting and length
control. Across many open-source LRMs including GPT-OSS, Qwen3, and
DeepSeek-R1, we find substantial failures in reasoning instruction adherence:
the highest instruction following score (IFS) remains below 0.25, meaning that
fewer than $25\%$ of reasoning traces comply with the given instructions.
Notably, as task difficulty increases, reasoning instruction following degrades
further. We also explore two strategies to enhance reasoning instruction
fidelity. (1) multi-turn reasoning and (2) Reasoning Instruction Finetuning
(RIF) using synthetic data. RIF improves the IFS of $GPT-OSS-20B$ from 0.11 to
0.27, indicating measurable progress but leaving ample room for improvement.

*Xuansheng Wu,Xiaoman Pan,Wenlin Yao,Jianshu Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现，不同基础模型在强化学习验证奖励（RLVR）后的推理性能差异源于其内部对规则合理性的感知能力。高潜力模型能够区分严格规则与噪声规则的概率分布，而弱模型则无法区分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究为什么不同预训练模型在RLVR后的推理性能差异巨大，寻找导致这种差异的微观属性。

Method: 将推理形式化为Horn子句链，使用交叉层稀疏自编码器从潜在空间提取特征，估计特征间转移概率，并用LLM对规则进行语义合理性分类。

Result: 发现高潜力模型具有内在的合理性感知能力，其内部概率分布在不同的合理性级别上系统性变化，而弱模型则无法区分。提出的SAL指标能准确预测RLVR后推理性能（R^2=0.87）。

Conclusion: 模型的推理潜力与其预训练时区分合理知识与不合理知识的内在能力相关，这为选择和设计更强的基础模型提供了基于内部机制的实际指标。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can elicit strong
reasoning in large language models (LLMs), while their performance after RLVR
varies dramatically across different base models. This raises a fundamental
question: what microscopic property of pre-trained models leads to this
variation? To investigate, we formalize reasoning as chains of Horn clauses
("if-then" rules) built from features extracted from the LLM's latent space via
cross-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs). We estimate the transition
probabilities between its features, and further categorize each rule by its
semantic soundness level (e.g., strict, plausible, noisy) with an LLM. Our key
discovery is that high-potential models are inherently soundness-aware: their
internal probability distributions systematically shift across rules' soundness
levels, becoming highly distinct for "strict" versus "noisy" rules. In
contrast, weaker models are soundness-agnostic, collapsing to one distribution
regardless of soundness levels. To quantify this, we introduce the
Soundness-Aware Level (SAL), a microscopic metric using the Jensen-Shannon
Divergence to measure the separation between these distributions. We show that
SAL's predictions of post-RLVR reasoning performance follow a precise empirical
law (R^2=0.87) across diverse model families (Qwen, Mistral, Llama, DeepSeek)
and scales (0.5B-14B). This reveals that a model's reasoning potential is tied
to its intrinsic, pre-trained ability to distinguish sound knowledge from
unsound ones. These findings underscore the critical role of model pre-training
in shaping reasoning and offer a practical metric grounded in the model's
internal mechanisms for selecting/designing stronger base models.

TL;DR: 使用MIMIC-III数据库中214名脑膜炎患者和46,303名非脑膜炎患者数据，通过集成学习方法构建脑膜炎诊断模型，在模拟急诊室场景下取得了优异的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 创建具有临床实用性的脑膜炎诊断工具，模拟真实急诊室场景，为未来AI驱动的脑膜炎诊断方法铺平道路。

Method: 采用两阶段特征选择过程，选择临床相关特征，训练随机森林、LightGBM和深度神经网络作为基础模型，然后通过逻辑回归元模型进行集成学习。

Result: 集成学习模型在两个测试集上表现优异：测试集1的AUC为0.9637，测试集2的AUC为0.9472。

Conclusion: 该方法为脑膜炎的AI诊断提供了有前景的途径，虽然直接部署临床诊断工具仍有挑战，但为未来应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: We utilized a cohort of 214 meningitis patients and 46,303 non-meningitis
patients from the MIMIC-III database. After extensive data preprocessing, which
included ICD-based cohort selection, one-hot encoding of coding, and a
two-stage feature selection process (for both the training set and the testing
sets), clinically relevant features such as gender and high-risk ICD codes
(including subarachnoid hemorrhage, secondary malignant neoplasm of the brain,
and generalized epilepsy) are selected. Overall, these clinically reasonable
and temporally adherent features provided excellent modeling performance. Three
models (Random Forest, LightGBM, and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are trained as
base models for Ensemble Learning. Base model outputs are aggregated and
stacked into a meta model (Logistic Regression) that uses the base model
outputs as input values in training. Ultimately, soldier outputs (AUC of
Testing Set 1: 0.9637, AUC of Testing Set 2: 0.9472) are obtained through
ensemble learning.
  We created a challenging condition for diagnosing meningitis, simulating a
real-world ER (Emergency Room) scenario to enhance clinical use in real-world
applications. While directly deploying a diagnostic tool that clinicians can
use is challenging, this paper paves the way for a potential future AI-driven
diagnostic approach for meningitis using Ensemble Learning.

Abstract: This work extends our previous study on enhancing 3D LiDAR point-cloud
classification with product coefficients
\cite{medina2025integratingproductcoefficientsimproved}, measure-theoretic
descriptors that complement the original spatial Lidar features. Here, we show
that combining product coefficients with an autoencoder representation and a
KNN classifier delivers consistent performance gains over both PCA-based
baselines and our earlier framework. We also investigate the effect of adding
product coefficients level by level, revealing a clear trend: richer sets of
coefficients systematically improve class separability and overall accuracy.
The results highlight the value of combining hierarchical product-coefficient
features with autoencoders to push LiDAR classification performance further.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究分布漂移下的顺序决策问题，传统方法在分布变化时性能下降，需要开发能够适应分布漂移的鲁棒决策算法。

Method: 提出熵正则化信任衰减方法，在信念更新和镜像下降决策中注入应力感知指数倾斜，建立Fenchel对偶等价性，并开发无参数对冲算法自适应调整倾斜。

Result: 证明了高概率敏感性边界，在KL漂移路径长度ST约束下实现O(√T)动态遗憾，获得O(1)每切换遗憾，而传统无应力更新会产生Ω(1)尾部风险。

Conclusion: 该框架统一了动态遗憾分析、分布鲁棒目标和KL正则化控制，提供了一种应力自适应的更新方法，可扩展到二阶更新、老虎机反馈、异常值处理等多个场景。

Abstract: We study sequential decision-making under distribution drift. We propose
entropy-regularized trust-decay, which injects stress-aware exponential tilting
into both belief updates and mirror-descent decisions. On the simplex, a
Fenchel-dual equivalence shows that belief tilt and decision tilt coincide. We
formalize robustness via fragility (worst-case excess risk in a KL ball),
belief bandwidth (radius sustaining a target excess), and a decision-space
Fragility Index (drift tolerated at $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret). We prove
high-probability sensitivity bounds and establish dynamic-regret guarantees of
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ under KL-drift path length $S_T = \sum_{t\ge2}\sqrt{{\rm
KL}(D_t|D_{t-1})/2}$. In particular, trust-decay achieves $O(1)$ per-switch
regret, while stress-free updates incur $\Omega(1)$ tails. A parameter-free
hedge adapts the tilt to unknown drift, whereas persistent over-tilting yields
an $\Omega(\lambda^2 T)$ stationary penalty. We further obtain
calibrated-stress bounds and extensions to second-order updates, bandit
feedback, outliers, stress variation, distributed optimization, and plug-in
KL-drift estimation. The framework unifies dynamic-regret analysis,
distributionally robust objectives, and KL-regularized control within a single
stress-adaptive update.

Motivation: 由于金融领域的高风险和高利害关系特性，在真实金融应用中部署LLM仍然具有挑战性，需要专门的可信赖性评估基准。

Method: 开发FinTrust基准测试，基于实际场景设计广泛的对齐问题，为每个可信赖性评估维度提供细粒度任务。

Result: 评估11个LLM发现：专有模型（如o4-mini）在大多数任务（如安全性）中表现更好；开源模型（如DeepSeek-V3）在特定领域（如行业级公平性）有优势；所有LLM在受托责任对齐和披露等挑战性任务中表现不佳，显示出法律意识方面的显著差距。

Conclusion: FinTrust可以作为金融领域LLM可信赖性评估的有价值基准，当前LLM在法律意识方面仍需改进。

Abstract: Recent LLMs have demonstrated promising ability in solving finance related

challenging due to its high risk and high stakes property. This paper
introduces FinTrust, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for
evaluating the trustworthiness of LLMs in finance applications. Our benchmark
focuses on a wide range of alignment issues based on practical context and
features fine-grained tasks for each dimension of trustworthiness evaluation.
We assess eleven LLMs on FinTrust and find that proprietary models like o4-mini
outperforms in most tasks such as safety while open-source models like
DeepSeek-V3 have advantage in specific areas like industry-level fairness. For
challenging task like fiduciary alignment and disclosure, all LLMs fall short,
showing a significant gap in legal awareness. We believe that FinTrust can be a
valuable benchmark for LLMs' trustworthiness evaluation in finance domain.

Motivation: 当前机器学习社区缺乏可靠、信息丰富且个体化的不确定性量化方法，这阻碍了AI/ML在风险敏感领域的应用。特别是在药物发现中，蛋白质-配体亲和力预测面临异质性噪声、化学空间不平衡和分布偏移等挑战。

Method: TESSERA结合专家混合模型的多样性和保形校准，提供具有可靠覆盖保证的逐样本不确定性，生成信息丰富且自适应的预测区间宽度来跟踪绝对误差。

Result: 在i.i.d.和基于支架的OOD分割下，TESSERA实现了接近名义覆盖率和最佳覆盖-宽度权衡（CWC），同时保持竞争性的自适应能力（最低AUSE）。SSC进一步确认区间大小适当。

Conclusion: TESSERA通过统一专家混合模型多样性和保形校准，提供了可信赖、紧凑且自适应的不确定性，适用于药物发现管道中的选择性预测和下游决策制定。

Abstract: Reliable, informative, and individual uncertainty quantification (UQ) remains
missing in current ML community. This hinders the effective application of
AI/ML to risk-sensitive domains. Most methods either fail to provide coverage
on new data, inflate intervals so broadly that they are not actionable, or
assign uncertainties that do not track actual error, especially under a
distribution shift. In high-stakes drug discovery, protein-ligand affinity
(PLI) prediction is especially challenging as assay noise is heterogeneous,
chemical space is imbalanced and large, and practical evaluations routinely
involve distribution shift. In this work, we introduce a novel uncertainty
quantification method, Trustworthy Expert Split-conformal with Scaled
Estimation for Efficient Reliable Adaptive intervals (TESSERA), that provides
per-sample uncertainty with reliable coverage guarantee, informative and
adaptive prediction interval widths that track the absolute error. We evaluate
on protein-ligand binding affinity prediction under both independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) and scaffold-based out-of-distribution (OOD)
splits, comparing against strong UQ baselines. TESSERA attains near-nominal
coverage and the best coverage-width trade-off as measured by the
Coverage-Width Criterion (CWC), while maintaining competitive adaptivity
(lowest Area Under the Sparsification Error (AUSE)). Size-Stratified Coverage
(SSC) further confirms that intervals are right-sized, indicating width
increases when data are scarce or noisy, and remain tight when predictions are
reliable. By unifying Mixture of Expert (MoE) diversity with conformal
calibration, TESSERA delivers trustworthy, tight, and adaptive uncertainties
that are well-suited to selective prediction and downstream decision-making in
the drug-discovery pipeline and other applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在可验证答案任务上有效扩展思维链推理，但在非可验证的人类偏好任务上应用仍具挑战且研究不足。

Method: DWRL通过双权重RL目标整合思维链推理与BT模型：实例级错位权重强调与人类偏好不一致的训练对，组级条件偏好分数促进有前景的思维。

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型规模（Llama3和Qwen2.5）上，DWRL始终优于GPM基线和标量模型，并产生连贯、可解释的思维。

Conclusion: DWRL作为推理增强偏好学习的通用框架，可扩展到可验证任务之外。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently proven effective at scaling
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models on tasks with
verifiable answers. However, extending RL to more general non-verifiable tasks,
typically in the format of human preference pairs, remains both challenging and
underexplored. In this work, we propose Dual-Weighted Reinforcement Learning
(DWRL), a new framework for preference modeling that integrates CoT reasoning
with the Bradley-Terry (BT) model via a dual-weighted RL objective that
preserves preference-modeling inductive bias. DWRL approximates the
maximum-likelihood objective of the BT model with two complementary weights: an
instance-wise misalignment weight, which emphasizes under-trained pairs
misaligned with human preference, and a group-wise (self-normalized)
conditional preference score, which promotes promising thoughts. In this paper,
we apply DWRL to preference modeling by training generative preference models
(GPMs) to first generate a thought and then predict the human preference score.
Across multiple benchmarks and model scales (Llama3 and Qwen2.5), DWRL
consistently outperforms both GPM baselines and scalar models, while producing
coherent, interpretable thoughts. In summary, our results position DWRL as a
general framework for reasoning-enhanced preference learning beyond verifiable
tasks.

Animal Health (WOAH), and geospatial context from GADM and Natural Earth. The
raw coordinates are processed using H3 hierarchical geospatial encoding to
capture spatial patterns. The model learns spatiotemporal dependencies from
bird movement sequences to estimate endpoint disease risk. Evaluation on a
held-out test set demonstrates strong predictive performance, achieving an
accuracy of 0.9821, area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.9803, average precision

*Yangyang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRO-InstructZero通过将零样本提示优化构建为鲁棒贝叶斯优化，解决了传统提示搜索方法在分布偏移下的性能下降问题，显著提升了提示的可靠性和可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动提示搜索方法（如InstructZero）在单一评估分布下优化预期性能，导致在分布偏移和对抗性评估中性能下降，提示无法在不同设置间有效迁移。

Method: 将零样本提示优化构建为鲁棒贝叶斯优化，使用f-散度球定义评估分布周围的模糊集，通过鲁棒采集规则最大化最坏情况期望效用，同时保持贝叶斯搜索的查询效率。

Result: 在形式化重写任务中准确率从61.3%提升至85-90%，代码调试在域偏移下获得约25分提升，稳定任务如因果推理保持96%以上准确率，改进在不同散度选择和解码温度下保持一致。

Conclusion: DRO-InstructZero将分布鲁棒优化与提示学习相结合，为现实世界不确定性下的可靠、可迁移提示对齐提供了即插即用的通用方法。

Abstract: Large language models are highly sensitive to prompt wording. However,
popular automatic prompt search methods, including InstructZero, often degrade
under distribution shift and adversarial evaluation because they optimize
expected performance under a single evaluation distribution. Consequently,
prompts that work in one setting frequently fail to transfer. To address this,
DRO-InstructZero formulates zero-shot prompt optimization as robust Bayesian
optimization. Specifically, an f-divergence ball defines an ambiguity set
around the evaluation distribution, and a robust acquisition rule maximizes
worst-case expected utility while retaining the query efficiency of Bayesian
search. Therefore, the search explicitly targets reliability under distribution
shift rather than average behavior alone. Experiments follow the
instruction-induction protocol with matched query budgets across formality
rewriting, code debugging, and translation. For example, on BIG-Bench
informative-to-formal rewriting, accuracy improves from 61.3 +/- 0.7% to
approximately 85-90%, yielding an absolute gain of about 25-30 points.
Moreover, auto-debugging shows about +25-point gains under domain shift.
Meanwhile, stable tasks such as cause-and-effect remain above 96%, indicating
no loss on in-distribution cases. Furthermore, improvements are consistent
across divergence choices and decoding temperatures. Overall, DRO-InstructZero
connects distributionally robust optimization with prompt learning, offering a
plug-and-play and general approach for reliable, transferable prompt alignment
under real-world uncertainty.

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对AdamW优化器的权重衰减缩放规则，解决了在尺度不变架构中μP方法因归一化层导致的宽度依赖性问题，实现了学习率和权重衰减的零样本跨宽度迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代尺度不变架构中，训练很快进入优化器主导的稳态，归一化层造成反向尺度敏感性，使得有效学习率变得宽度依赖，从而破坏了μP方法的迁移效果。

Method: 引入AdamW的权重衰减缩放规则，保持子层增益跨宽度不变。基于奇异值谱的观察，提出经验性权重衰减缩放规则λ₂∝√d，结合向量参数在η₁=Θ_d(1)和λ₁=0下训练。

Result: 在LLaMA风格Transformer和最小合成设置中验证了该规则，实现了学习率和权重衰减从代理宽度到目标宽度的零样本迁移，无需每个宽度单独调参。

Conclusion: 通过显式控制优化器设置的稳态尺度，将μP方法扩展到近初始化阶段之外，为AdamW下的宽度鲁棒超参数迁移提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Empirical scaling laws prescribe how to allocate parameters, data, and
compute, while maximal-update parameterization ($\mu$P) enables learning-rate
transfer across widths by equalizing early-time update magnitudes. However, in
modern scale-invariant architectures, training quickly enters an
optimizer-governed steady state where normalization layers create backward
scale sensitivity and the effective learning rate becomes width dependent,
degrading $\mu$P transfer. We address this by introducing a weight-decay
scaling rule for AdamW that preserves sublayer gain across widths. Empirically,
the singular-value spectrum of each matrix parameter scales in norm as
$\sqrt{\eta/\lambda}$ with an approximately invariant shape; under width
scaling $d$, we observe that the top singular value scales approximately as
$\sqrt{\eta/\lambda}\cdot d^{0.75}$. Combining this observation with the $\mu$P
learning-rate rule $\eta_2\propto d^{-1}$ for matrix-like parameters implies an
empirical weight-decay scaling rule $\lambda_2\propto \sqrt{d}$ that
approximately keeps sublayer gains width invariant. Together with vector-like
parameters trained at $\eta_1=\Theta_d(1)$ and $\lambda_1=0$, this yields
\emph{zero-shot} transfer of both learning rate and weight decay from proxy to
target widths, removing per-width sweeps. We validate the rule on LLaMA-style
Transformers and in a minimal synthetic setting, and we provide a simple
diagnostic, matching top singular values, to check sublayer-gain invariance.
Our results extend $\mu$P beyond the near-init regime by explicitly controlling
steady-state scales set by the optimizer, offering a practical recipe for
width-robust hyperparameter transfer under AdamW.

Motivation: 当前时空地球观测模型依赖纯相关性特征，在异质域间迁移失败。因果建模能发现稳定不变关系，提高分布偏移下的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出RIC-TSC框架，使用J-PCMCI+进行区域特定和不变预测因子的因果发现，将验证的预测因子及其时间滞后输入轻量级分类器。

Result: 在两个对比融化季节的1000个手动标记湖泊上，因果模型在分布外评估中比相关性基线准确率最高提升12.59%。

Conclusion: 因果发现不仅是特征选择手段，还是构建可泛化、机制基础的地球表面动态过程模型的途径。

Abstract: Causal modeling offers a principled foundation for uncovering stable,
invariant relationships in time-series data, thereby improving robustness and
generalization under distribution shifts. Yet its potential is underutilized in
spatiotemporal Earth observation, where models often depend on purely
correlational features that fail to transfer across heterogeneous domains. We
propose RIC-TSC, a regionally-informed causal time-series classification
framework that embeds lag-aware causal discovery directly into sequence
modeling, enabling both predictive accuracy and scientific interpretability.
Using multi-modal satellite and reanalysis data-including Sentinel-1 microwave
backscatter, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 optical reflectance, and CARRA
meteorological variables-we leverage Joint PCMCI+ (J-PCMCI+) to identify
region-specific and invariant predictors of supraglacial lake evolution in
Greenland. Causal graphs are estimated globally and per basin, with validated
predictors and their time lags supplied to lightweight classifiers. On a
balanced benchmark of 1000 manually labeled lakes from two contrasting melt
seasons (2018-2019), causal models achieve up to 12.59% higher accuracy than
correlation-based baselines under out-of-distribution evaluation. These results
show that causal discovery is not only a means of feature selection but also a
pathway to generalizable and mechanistically grounded models of dynamic Earth
surface processes.

Conclusion: 提出的不确定性感知伪标签框架有效缓解了不可靠伪标签的影响，为半监督回归提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Pseudo-labeling is a commonly used paradigm in semi-supervised learning, yet
its application to semi-supervised regression (SSR) remains relatively
under-explored. Unlike classification, where pseudo-labels are discrete and
confidence-based filtering is effective, SSR involves continuous outputs with
heteroscedastic noise, making it challenging to assess pseudo-label
reliability. As a result, naive pseudo-labeling can lead to error accumulation
and overfitting to incorrect labels. To address this, we propose an
uncertainty-aware pseudo-labeling framework that dynamically adjusts
pseudo-label influence from a bi-level optimization perspective. By jointly
minimizing empirical risk over all data and optimizing uncertainty estimates to
enhance generalization on labeled data, our method effectively mitigates the
impact of unreliable pseudo-labels. We provide theoretical insights and
extensive experiments to validate our approach across various benchmark SSR
datasets, and the results demonstrate superior robustness and performance
compared to existing methods. Our code is available at

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs), such as GPT-4 and AlphaFold, are reshaping the
landscape of scientific research. Beyond accelerating tasks such as hypothesis
generation, experimental design, and result interpretation, they prompt a more
fundamental question: Are FMs merely enhancing existing scientific
methodologies, or are they redefining the way science is conducted? In this
paper, we argue that FMs are catalyzing a transition toward a new scientific
paradigm. We introduce a three-stage framework to describe this evolution: (1)
Meta-Scientific Integration, where FMs enhance workflows within traditional
paradigms; (2) Hybrid Human-AI Co-Creation, where FMs become active
collaborators in problem formulation, reasoning, and discovery; and (3)
Autonomous Scientific Discovery, where FMs operate as independent agents
capable of generating new scientific knowledge with minimal human intervention.
Through this lens, we review current applications and emerging capabilities of
FMs across existing scientific paradigms. We further identify risks and future
directions for FM-enabled scientific discovery. This position paper aims to
support the scientific community in understanding the transformative role of
FMs and to foster reflection on the future of scientific discovery. Our project

Conclusion: EnKF-FCNN方法能有效提高数据同化精度，计算成本低，且可通过耦合不同模型和使用其他集成数据同化方法适应多样化应用。

Abstract: Ensemble-based data assimilation (DA) methods have become increasingly
popular due to their inherent ability to address nonlinear dynamic problems.
However, these methods often face a trade-off between analysis accuracy and
computational efficiency, as larger ensemble sizes required for higher accuracy
also lead to greater computational cost. In this study, we propose a novel
machine learning-based data assimilation approach that combines the traditional
ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) with a fully connected neural network (FCNN).
Specifically, our method uses a relatively small ensemble size to generate
preliminary yet suboptimal analysis states via EnKF. A FCNN is then employed to
learn and predict correction terms for these states, thereby mitigating the
performance degradation induced by the limited ensemble size. We evaluate the
performance of our proposed EnKF-FCNN method through numerical experiments
involving Lorenz systems and nonlinear ocean wave field simulations. The
results consistently demonstrate that the new method achieves higher accuracy
than traditional EnKF with the same ensemble size, while incurring negligible
additional computational cost. Moreover, the EnKF-FCNN method is adaptable to
diverse applications through coupling with different models and the use of
alternative ensemble-based DA methods.

Abstract: Clustered Federated Learning has emerged as an effective approach for
handling heterogeneous data across clients by partitioning them into clusters
with similar or identical data distributions. However, most existing methods,
including the Iterative Federated Clustering Algorithm (IFCA), rely on a
central server to coordinate model updates, which creates a bottleneck and a
single point of failure, limiting their applicability in more realistic
decentralized learning settings. In this work, we introduce DFCA, a fully
decentralized clustered FL algorithm that enables clients to collaboratively
train cluster-specific models without central coordination. DFCA uses a
sequential running average to aggregate models from neighbors as updates
arrive, providing a communication-efficient alternative to batch aggregation
while maintaining clustering performance. Our experiments on various datasets
demonstrate that DFCA outperforms other decentralized algorithms and performs
comparably to centralized IFCA, even under sparse connectivity, highlighting
its robustness and practicality for dynamic real-world decentralized networks.

Motivation: 传统的随机特征模型需要大量特征才能达到良好性能，本文旨在通过数据依赖的加权采样方案减少所需特征数量，提高学习效率。

Method: 提出数据依赖的杠杆加权采样方案，并开发算法寻找近似核函数，然后应用杠杆加权采样来学习加权RFLAF。

Result: 通过加权采样，MSE损失情况下的特征数边界从Ω(1/ε²)改进为Ω̃((1/ε)^{1/t})，当Gram矩阵有限秩时甚至达到Ω(1)；Lipschitz损失边界从Ω(1/ε²)改进为Ω̃((1/ε²)^{1/t})。实验验证加权RFLAF能用更少特征达到相同性能。

Conclusion: 数据依赖的加权采样方案能显著减少随机特征模型所需特征数量，提高学习效率，理论和实验结果一致验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: This paper studies the generalization properties of a recently proposed
kernel method, the Random Feature models with Learnable Activation Functions
(RFLAF). By applying a data-dependent sampling scheme for generating features,
we provide by far the sharpest bounds on the required number of features for
learning RFLAF in both the regression and classification tasks. We provide a
unified theorem that describes the complexity of the feature number $s$, and
discuss the results for the plain sampling scheme and the data-dependent
leverage weighted scheme. Through weighted sampling, the bound on $s$ in the
MSE loss case is improved from $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ to
$\tilde{\Omega}((1/\epsilon)^{1/t})$ in general $(t\geq 1)$, and even to
$\Omega(1)$ when the Gram matrix has a finite rank. For the Lipschitz loss
case, the bound is improved from $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ to
$\tilde{\Omega}((1/\epsilon^2)^{1/t})$. To learn the weighted RFLAF, we also
propose an algorithm to find an approximate kernel and then apply the leverage
weighted sampling. Empirical results show that the weighted RFLAF achieves the
same performances with a significantly fewer number of features compared to the
plainly sampled RFLAF, validating our theories and the effectiveness of this
method.

Motivation: 现有图神经网络防御方法通常只针对单一攻击类型，缺乏同时防御多种威胁的统一方法，需要开发能够抵御后门攻击、边操纵和节点注入攻击的综合防御方案。

Method: 使用MoE架构，提出基于互信息的逻辑多样性损失使不同专家关注不同的邻域结构，并设计鲁棒感知路由器识别扰动模式并将受扰节点路由到相应的鲁棒专家。

Conclusion: 基于MoE的统一防御框架能够有效同时防御多种图对抗攻击，通过逻辑多样性和自适应路由机制确保在局部结构扰动下仍有足够专家子集保持不受影响。

Abstract: Extensive research has highlighted the vulnerability of graph neural networks
(GNNs) to adversarial attacks, including manipulation, node injection, and the
recently emerging threat of backdoor attacks. However, existing defenses
typically focus on a single type of attack, lacking a unified approach to
simultaneously defend against multiple threats. In this work, we leverage the
flexibility of the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture to design a scalable
and unified framework for defending against backdoor, edge manipulation, and
node injection attacks. Specifically, we propose an MI-based logic diversity
loss to encourage individual experts to focus on distinct neighborhood
structures in their decision processes, thus ensuring a sufficient subset of
experts remains unaffected under perturbations in local structures. Moreover,
we introduce a robustness-aware router that identifies perturbation patterns
and adaptively routes perturbed nodes to corresponding robust experts.
Extensive experiments conducted under various adversarial settings demonstrate
that our method consistently achieves superior robustness against multiple

Abstract: A key question in sequence modeling with neural networks is how to represent
and learn highly nonlinear and probabilistic state dynamics. Operator theory
views such dynamics as linear maps on Hilbert spaces containing mean embedding
vectors of distributions, offering an appealing but currently overlooked
perspective. We propose a new approach to sequence modeling based on an
operator-theoretic view of a hidden Markov model (HMM). Instead of
materializing stochastic recurrence, we embed the full sequence distribution as
a tensor in the product Hilbert space. A generative process is then defined as
maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) gradient flow in the space of sequences. To
overcome challenges with large tensors and slow sampling convergence, we
introduce spectral mean flows, a novel tractable algorithm integrating two core
concepts. First, we propose a new neural architecture by leveraging spectral
decomposition of linear operators to derive a scalable tensor network
decomposition of sequence mean embeddings. Second, we extend MMD gradient flows
to time-dependent Hilbert spaces and connect them to flow matching via the
continuity equation, enabling simulation-free learning and faster sampling. We
demonstrate competitive results on a range of time-series modeling datasets.

Conclusion: BREEZE通过同时增强学习稳定性、策略提取能力和表示学习质量，有效解决了零样本强化学习中的关键挑战，为通用策略学习提供了改进框架。

Abstract: The recent development of zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has opened a
new avenue for learning pre-trained generalist policies that can adapt to
arbitrary new tasks in a zero-shot manner. While the popular Forward-Backward
representations (FB) and related methods have shown promise in zero-shot RL, we
empirically found that their modeling lacks expressivity and that extrapolation
errors caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions during offline learning
sometimes lead to biased representations, ultimately resulting in suboptimal
performance. To address these issues, we propose Behavior-REgularizEd Zero-shot
RL with Expressivity enhancement (BREEZE), an upgraded FB-based framework that
simultaneously enhances learning stability, policy extraction capability, and
representation learning quality. BREEZE introduces behavioral regularization in
zero-shot RL policy learning, transforming policy optimization into a stable
in-sample learning paradigm. Additionally, BREEZE extracts the policy using a
task-conditioned diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-quality and
multimodal action distributions in zero-shot RL settings. Moreover, BREEZE
employs expressive attention-based architectures for representation modeling to
capture the complex relationships between environmental dynamics. Extensive
experiments on ExORL and D4RL Kitchen demonstrate that BREEZE achieves the best
or near-the-best performance while exhibiting superior robustness compared to
prior offline zero-shot RL methods. The official implementation is available

Conclusion: SWFP提供了一种高效算法，通过级联小流块微调预训练流，具有训练子模型更简单/更快、计算/内存成本降低以及基于Wasserstein信任区域的可证明稳定性等优势。

Abstract: While behavior cloning with flow/diffusion policies excels at learning
complex skills from demonstrations, it remains vulnerable to distributional
shift, and standard RL methods struggle to fine-tune these models due to their
iterative inference process and the limitations of existing workarounds. In
this work, we introduce the Stepwise Flow Policy (SWFP) framework, founded on
the key insight that discretizing the flow matching inference process via a
fixed-step Euler scheme inherently aligns it with the variational
Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) principle from optimal transport. SWFP
decomposes the global flow into a sequence of small, incremental
transformations between proximate distributions. Each step corresponds to a JKO
update, regularizing policy changes to stay near the previous iterate and
ensuring stable online adaptation with entropic regularization. This
decomposition yields an efficient algorithm that fine-tunes pre-trained flows
via a cascade of small flow blocks, offering significant advantages:
simpler/faster training of sub-models, reduced computational/memory costs, and
provable stability grounded in Wasserstein trust regions. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate SWFP's enhanced stability, efficiency, and superior
adaptation performance across diverse robotic control benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of ionic conductivity in electrolyte systems is crucial
for advancing numerous scientific and technological applications. While
significant progress has been made, current research faces two fundamental
challenges: (1) the lack of high-quality standardized benchmarks, and (2)
inadequate modeling of geometric structure and intermolecular interactions in
mixture systems. To address these limitations, we first reorganize and enhance
the CALiSol and DiffMix electrolyte datasets by incorporating geometric graph
representations of molecules. We then propose GeoMix, a novel geometry-aware
framework that preserves Set-SE(3) equivariance-an essential but challenging
property for mixture systems. At the heart of GeoMix lies the Geometric
Interaction Network (GIN), an equivariant module specifically designed for
intermolecular geometric message passing. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that GeoMix consistently outperforms diverse baselines (including MLPs, GNNs,
and geometric GNNs) across both datasets, validating the importance of
cross-molecular geometric interactions and equivariant message passing for
accurate property prediction. This work not only establishes new benchmarks for
electrolyte research but also provides a general geometric learning framework
that advances modeling of mixture systems in energy materials, pharmaceutical
development, and beyond.

Abstract: Real-time forecasting from streaming data poses critical challenges: handling
non-stationary dynamics, operating under strict computational limits, and
adapting rapidly without catastrophic forgetting. However, many existing
approaches face trade-offs between accuracy, adaptability, and efficiency,
particularly when deployed in constrained computing environments. We introduce
WORK-DMD (Windowed Online Random Kernel Dynamic Mode Decomposition), a method
that combines Random Fourier Features with online Dynamic Mode Decomposition to
capture nonlinear dynamics through explicit feature mapping, while preserving
fixed computational cost and competitive predictive accuracy across evolving
data. WORK-DMD employs Sherman-Morrison updates within rolling windows,
enabling continuous adaptation to evolving dynamics from only current data,
eliminating the need for lengthy training or large storage requirements for
historical data. Experiments on benchmark datasets across several domains show
that WORK-DMD achieves higher accuracy than several state-of-the-art online
forecasting methods, while requiring only a single pass through the data and
demonstrating particularly strong performance in short-term forecasting. Our
results show that combining kernel evaluations with adaptive matrix updates
achieves strong predictive performance with minimal data requirements. This
sample efficiency offers a practical alternative to deep learning for streaming
forecasting applications.

Abstract: The widespread 'deeper is better' philosophy has driven the creation of
architectures like ResNet and Transformer, which achieve high performance by
stacking numerous layers. However, increasing model depth comes with challenges
such as longer training times, higher inference latency, and impracticality on
resource-constrained devices. To address these issues, we propose ParaFormer, a
shallow Transformer architecture designed for true parallelism in both
structure and computation. By formulating standard Transformers as function
approximators in closed-form, our theoretical analysis shows that their
performance relies on inter-layer collaboration for progressive approximation,
rather than depth itself. While deep Transformers enforce this collaboration
through sequential designs, we demonstrate that such collaboration is not
inherently tied to sequential structures. ParaFormer removes the sequential
constraint by organizing layers into parallel branches, enforcing inter-layer
collaboration algorithmically. Specifically, we implement progressive
approximation, ensuring that each new branch further reduces the loss from
preceding branches, enabling faster convergence. Extensive experiments validate
ParaFormer's effectiveness, outperforming standard Transformers like ViT.
Moreover, ParaFormer supports up to 15.07x model compression and facilitates
model expansion for adaptive continuous learning. Experimental results on
multi-GPU deployment demonstrate that ParaFormer is 3.30x faster than widely
used parallelism solutions such as FairScale. These advancements stem from our
closed-form formulation of Transformers based on the Universal Approximation
Theorem, which not only explains the ``depth belief'' but also opens new
avenues for designing efficient Transformer architectures. Source code:

Abstract: This dissertation investigates how reinforcement learning (RL) methods can be
designed to be safe, sample-efficient, and robust. Framed through the unifying
perspective of contextual-bandit RL, the work addresses two major application
domains - ranking and recommendation, and text-to-image diffusion models. The
first part of the thesis develops theory and algorithms for safe deployment in
ranking systems. An exposure-based generalisation bound is derived, leading to
a counterfactual risk-minimisation objective whose solution is guaranteed not
to underperform the logging policy, even with sparse feedback. This guarantee
is extended to doubly robust estimators, enabling safety even under adversarial
or misspecified user models and offering practitioners explicit control over
permissible utility loss. The second part turns to single-action bandits, where
various off-policy estimators are unified within a baseline-correction
framework. A closed-form optimal baseline is proposed and shown to minimise
both evaluation and policy-gradient variance, thereby improving off-policy
learning reliability. The final part examines the trade-offs between efficiency
and effectiveness in generative RL. A systematic study of PPO and REINFORCE
motivates the Leave-One-Out PPO (LOOP) algorithm, which combines multiple
diffusion trajectories with a REINFORCE-style baseline inside PPO's clipped
objective. LOOP achieves PPO-level sample efficiency while producing
generations that align more faithfully with textual attributes.

Abstract: Test-time scaling seeks to improve the reasoning performance of large
language models (LLMs) by adding computational resources. A prevalent approach
within the field is sampling-based test-time scaling methods, which enhance
reasoning by generating multiple reasoning paths for a given input during
inference. However, despite its practical success, the theoretical foundations
remain underexplored. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical framework
for analyzing sampling-based test-time scaling methods, grounded in the
perspective of confidence estimation. Based on the framework, we analyze two
dominant paradigms: self-consistency and perplexity, and reveal key
limitations: self-consistency suffers from high estimation error while
perplexity exhibits substantial modeling error and possible degradation of the
estimation error convergence. To address these limitations, we introduce RPC, a
hybrid method that leverages our theoretical insights through two key
components: Perplexity Consistency and Reasoning Pruning. Perplexity
Consistency combines the strengths of self-consistency and perplexity, boosting
the convergence rate of estimation error from linear to exponential while
preserving model error. Reasoning Pruning prevents degradation by eliminating
low-probability reasoning paths. Both theoretical analysis and empirical
results across seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that RPC has a strong
potential for reducing reasoning error. Notably, RPC achieves reasoning
performance comparable to self-consistency while not only enhancing confidence
reliability but also reducing sampling costs by 50%. The code and resources are
available at https://wnjxyk.github.io/RPC.

Result: 在标准平滑性和耗散性假设下证明了存在性和收敛性，在KL散度和Wasserstein-2距离上获得衰减率。在物理系统数值近似上表现具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了比受限摊销后验更紧的ELBO界限，为潜变量能量模型训练提供了理论保证和实际有效的替代方案。

Abstract: Latent-variable energy-based models (LVEBMs) assign a single normalized
energy to joint pairs of observed data and latent variables, offering
expressive generative modeling while capturing hidden structure. We recast
maximum-likelihood training as a saddle problem over distributions on the
latent and joint manifolds and view the inner updates as coupled Wasserstein
gradient flows. The resulting algorithm alternates overdamped Langevin updates
for a joint negative pool and for conditional latent particles with stochastic
parameter ascent, requiring no discriminator or auxiliary networks. We prove
existence and convergence under standard smoothness and dissipativity
assumptions, with decay rates in KL divergence and Wasserstein-2 distance. The
saddle-point view further yields an ELBO strictly tighter than bounds obtained
with restricted amortized posteriors. Our method is evaluated on numerical
approximations of physical systems and performs competitively against
comparable approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms struggle with learning optimal
policies for tasks where reward feedback is sparse and depends on a complex
sequence of events in the environment. Probabilistic reward machines (PRMs) are
finite-state formalisms that can capture temporal dependencies in the reward
signal, along with nondeterministic task outcomes. While special RL algorithms
can exploit this finite-state structure to expedite learning, PRMs remain
difficult to modify and design by hand. This hinders the already difficult
tasks of utilizing high-level causal knowledge about the environment, and
transferring the reward formalism into a new domain with a different causal
structure. This paper proposes a novel method to incorporate causal information
in the form of Temporal Logic-based Causal Diagrams into the reward formalism,
thereby expediting policy learning and aiding the transfer of task
specifications to new environments. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical
result about convergence to optimal policy for our method, and demonstrate its
strengths empirically.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法假设演示策略属于低复杂度策略类，但本文认为奖励模型（指定哪些答案正确）属于低基数类是更弱的假设，在此情况下最大似然估计可能失败。

Method: 将问题形式化为上下文赌博机中的离线模仿学习，提出了一种基于奖励模型低基数假设的新方法，样本复杂度与奖励类基数呈对数关系。

Result: 证明了最大似然估计方法在奖励模型低基数假设下可能失败，而新方法能够以对数样本复杂度学习。

Conclusion: 当从正确演示中学习时，需要超越传统的似然最大化方法，考虑奖励模型的低基数特性。

Abstract: We study the problem of learning to generate an answer (or completion) to a
question (or prompt), where there could be multiple correct answers, any one of
which is acceptable at test time. Learning is based on demonstrations of some
correct answer to each training question, as in Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT).
We formalize the problem as offline imitation learning in contextual bandits,
with demonstrations from some optimal policy, without explicitly observed
rewards. Prior work assumes that the demonstrator belongs to a low-complexity
policy class, which motivates maximum likelihood estimation (i.e., log-loss
minimization). In contrast, we propose relying only on the reward model
(specifying which answers are correct) being in a low-cardinality class, which
we argue is a weaker assumption. We show that likelihood maximization methods
can fail in this case, and instead devise an alternative novel approach that
learns with sample complexity logarithmic in the cardinality of the reward
class. Our work motivates looking beyond likelihood maximization when learning
from correct demonstrations.

Motivation: 解决因果推断中治疗分配偏差问题，传统对抗训练方法存在不稳定性和调参负担，需要更稳定且理论完备的方法。

Method: 学习随机表示Z来预测结果，同时最小化I(Z;T)，推导出可处理的变分目标上界信息项，并与监督解码器耦合。

Conclusion: 该方法在避免对抗训练不稳定性的同时，实现了良好的反事实预测性能，可自然扩展到动态设置。

Abstract: We study counterfactual prediction under assignment bias and propose a
mathematically grounded, information-theoretic approach that removes
treatment-covariate dependence without adversarial training. Starting from a
bound that links the counterfactual-factual risk gap to mutual information, we
learn a stochastic representation Z that is predictive of outcomes while
minimizing I(Z; T). We derive a tractable variational objective that
upper-bounds the information term and couples it with a supervised decoder,
yielding a stable, provably motivated training criterion. The framework extends
naturally to dynamic settings by applying the information penalty to sequential
representations at each decision time. We evaluate the method on controlled
numerical simulations and a real-world clinical dataset, comparing against
recent state-of-the-art balancing, reweighting, and adversarial baselines.
Across metrics of likelihood, counterfactual error, and policy evaluation, our
approach performs favorably while avoiding the training instabilities and
tuning burden of adversarial schemes.

Conclusion: OffSim框架能够有效从专家轨迹中学习环境动态和奖励函数，实现离线策略训练，为强化学习提供了一种更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms typically utilize an interactive simulator
(i.e., environment) with a predefined reward function for policy training.
Developing such simulators and manually defining reward functions, however, is
often time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this, we propose an
Offline Simulator (OffSim), a novel model-based offline inverse reinforcement
learning (IRL) framework, to emulate environmental dynamics and reward
structure directly from expert-generated state-action trajectories. OffSim
jointly optimizes a high-entropy transition model and an IRL-based reward
function to enhance exploration and improve the generalizability of the learned
reward. Leveraging these learned components, OffSim can subsequently train a
policy offline without further interaction with the real environment.
Additionally, we introduce OffSim$^+$, an extension that incorporates a
marginal reward for multi-dataset settings to enhance exploration. Extensive
MuJoCo experiments demonstrate that OffSim achieves substantial performance
gains over existing offline IRL methods, confirming its efficacy and
robustness.

Method: SESA顺序采样框架：先生成多样化的解决方案草图，然后将其扩展为完整推理路径，每个新输出都基于前一个输出进行条件生成，促进多样性

Result: 在合成任务中，顺序采样在路径多样性和从崩溃中恢复方面优于传统RL方法；在三个智能体基准测试中，成功率分别提升+0.25、+0.42和+0.07（相比基线RL最高提升211%）

Conclusion: SESA为探索提供了结构化方法，为RL训练的LLM实现更有效和多样化的推理铺平了道路

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been pivotal in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but it often suffers from limited
exploration and entropy collapse, where models exploit a narrow set of
solutions, leading to a loss of sampling diversity and subsequently preventing
RL from further improving performance. This issue is exacerbated in parallel
sampling methods, where multiple outputs are drawn from the same distribution,
potentially causing the model to converge to similar solutions. We propose
SESA, a novel SEquential SAmpling framework that mitigates this challenge by
generating diverse solution sketches sequentially before expanding them into
full reasoning paths. This approach ensures broader exploration by conditioning
each new output on previous ones, promoting diversity throughout the process
and preventing policy collapse. Our experiments on a synthetic task show that
sequential sampling consistently outperforms traditional RL methods in terms of
path diversity and recovery from collapse. Further evaluations on real-world
tasks demonstrate that SESA improves both the exploration of valid strategies
and the overall performance of LLMs. On three agent benchmarks, SESA lifts
success rates by $+0.25$, $+0.42$, and $+0.07$ absolute over the base model (up
to an additional $211\%$ relative improvement over baseline RL), underscoring
its exploration advantage. This work introduces a structured approach to
exploration, paving the way for more effective and diverse reasoning in
RL-trained LLMs. Our code is released at https://github.com/MuLabPKU/sesa.

Motivation: 现有CLIP及其变体未能充分利用PMI的线性结构，而理论研究表明跨模态相似度度量应对应点互信息。

Method: 利用再生核希尔伯特空间中的内积来近似PMI，提出KME-CLIP方法。

Result: 理论上证明可以任意精度逼近PMI，实证表明在多个检索和分类任务中优于标准CLIP。

Conclusion: KME-CLIP通过更好地利用PMI的线性结构，在多模态对比预训练中实现了性能提升。

Abstract: In this study, we propose an enhancement to the similarity computation
mechanism in multi-modal contrastive pretraining frameworks such as CLIP. Prior
theoretical research has demonstrated that the optimal similarity metrics
between paired modalities should correspond to the pointwise mutual information
(PMI) between the two modalities. However, the current implementations of CLIP
and its variants fail to fully utilize the underlying linear structure of PMI.
We therefore propose KME-CLIP, which leverages this structure through the inner
product in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We theoretically prove that our
method can approximate PMI with arbitrary accuracy and empirically demonstrate
that our approach overall outperforms the standard CLIP formulation across
several retrieval and classification tasks.

Motivation: 挑战Transformer组件（如非线性激活和归一化）本质上是非单射的传统观点，证明语言模型实际上能够无损地表示输入序列。

Method: 首先从数学上证明Transformer语言模型在初始化时就是单射的，并在训练过程中保持这一性质；然后通过数十亿次碰撞测试进行实证验证；最后提出SipIt算法实现从隐藏激活到输入文本的精确重构。

Conclusion: 单射性是语言模型的基本且可利用的特性，对模型的透明度、可解释性和安全部署具有直接意义。

Abstract: Transformer components such as non-linear activations and normalization are
inherently non-injective, suggesting that different inputs could map to the
same output and prevent exact recovery of the input from a model's
representations. In this paper, we challenge this view. First, we prove
mathematically that transformer language models mapping discrete input
sequences to their corresponding sequence of continuous representations are
injective and therefore lossless, a property established at initialization and
preserved during training. Second, we confirm this result empirically through
billions of collision tests on six state-of-the-art language models, and
observe no collisions. Third, we operationalize injectivity: we introduce
SipIt, the first algorithm that provably and efficiently reconstructs the exact
input text from hidden activations, establishing linear-time guarantees and
demonstrating exact invertibility in practice. Overall, our work establishes
injectivity as a fundamental and exploitable property of language models, with
direct implications for transparency, interpretability, and safe deployment.

Abstract: The concept of knowledge distillation (KD) describes the training of a
student model from a teacher model and is a widely adopted technique in deep
learning. However, it is still not clear how and why distillation works.
Previous studies focus on two central aspects of distillation: model size, and
generalisation. In this work we study distillation in a third dimension:
dataset size. We present a suite of experiments across a wide range of
datasets, tasks and neural architectures, demonstrating that the effect of
distillation is not only preserved but amplified in low-data regimes. We call
this newly discovered property the data efficiency of distillation. Equipped
with this new perspective, we test the predictive power of existing theories of
KD as we vary the dataset size. Our results disprove the hypothesis that
distillation can be understood as label smoothing, and provide further evidence
in support of the dark knowledge hypothesis. Finally, we analyse the impact of
modelling factors such as the objective, scale and relative number of samples
on the observed phenomenon. Ultimately, this work reveals that the dataset size
may be a fundamental but overlooked variable in the mechanisms underpinning
distillation.

Motivation: 评估MC Dropout不确定性在脑肿瘤MRI分割中识别分割错误（特别是边界区域）的有效性。

Method: 使用U-Net在四种数据增强设置下进行2D脑肿瘤MRI分割，通过50次随机前向传播计算不确定性，并与像素级误差进行Pearson和Spearman相关性分析。

Result: 全局相关性较弱（r≈0.30-0.38），边界相关性可忽略（|r|<0.05），不同增强方法间差异虽统计显著但无实际意义。

Conclusion: MC Dropout不确定性对边界错误定位提供有限线索，需要开发替代或混合不确定性估计方法用于医学图像分割。

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation from MRI is vital for diagnosis and
treatment planning. Although Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout is widely used to
estimate model uncertainty, its effectiveness in identifying segmentation
errors -- especially near tumor boundaries -- remains unclear. This study
empirically examines the relationship between MC Dropout--based uncertainty and
segmentation error in 2D brain tumor MRI segmentation using a U-Net trained
under four augmentation settings: none, horizontal flip, rotation, and scaling.
Uncertainty was computed from 50 stochastic forward passes and correlated with
pixel-wise errors using Pearson and Spearman coefficients. Results show weak
global correlations ($r \approx 0.30$--$0.38$) and negligible boundary
correlations ($|r| < 0.05$). Although differences across augmentations were
statistically significant ($p < 0.001$), they lacked practical relevance. These
findings suggest that MC Dropout uncertainty provides limited cues for boundary
error localization, underscoring the need for alternative or hybrid uncertainty
estimation methods in medical image segmentation.

*Sibo Xiao*

TL;DR: 提出战略双重稳健（SDR）估计器，将战略均衡建模与双重稳健估计相结合，用于战略环境中的因果推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决因战略代理人行为导致的内生处理分配问题，在保持双重稳健性的同时纳入战略考量。

Method: 集成战略均衡建模与双重稳健估计框架，在战略无混淆性假设下进行理论分析。

Result: SDR在实证评估中表现优于基线方法，偏差减少7.6%-29.3%，在不同战略强度下保持稳健，且随代理人数量的增加具有良好可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该框架为代理人对干预措施做出战略响应时的可靠因果推断提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: We introduce the Strategic Doubly Robust (SDR) estimator, a novel framework
that integrates strategic equilibrium modeling with doubly robust estimation
for causal inference in strategic environments. SDR addresses endogenous
treatment assignment arising from strategic agent behavior, maintaining double
robustness while incorporating strategic considerations. Theoretical analysis
confirms SDR's consistency and asymptotic normality under strategic
unconfoundedness. Empirical evaluations demonstrate SDR's superior performance
over baseline methods, achieving 7.6\%-29.3\% bias reduction across varying
strategic strengths and maintaining robust scalability with agent populations.
The framework provides a principled approach for reliable causal inference when
agents respond strategically to interventions.

### [206] [On the Neural Feature Ansatz for Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15563)
*Edward Tansley,Estelle Massart,Coralia Cartis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文扩展了神经特征假设(NFA)的理论分析，证明了在平衡权重初始化下，L层线性网络的NFA指数为α=1/L，揭示了NFA的深度依赖性。对于不平衡初始化，证明在权重衰减下NFA渐近成立，并提供了非线性激活网络的反例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解特征学习是建立深度神经网络数学基础的重要开放问题。神经特征假设(NFA)描述了训练后网络第一层权重Gram矩阵与输入梯度外积平均(AGOP)的幂律关系，需要更深入的理论分析。

Method: 采用梯度流动力学和平衡权重初始化假设，理论推导L层线性网络的NFA指数关系。分析不平衡初始化下权重衰减的影响，并通过数值实验验证理论结果。

Result: 证明在平衡初始化下，L层线性网络的NFA指数为α=1/L；在权重衰减下，不平衡初始化的NFA渐近成立；发现非线性激活网络存在NFA不成立的反例。

Conclusion: NFA的指数具有深度依赖性，权重衰减有助于不平衡初始化下的NFA成立，但非线性激活可能破坏NFA，这为理解深度网络特征学习提供了重要理论洞见。

Abstract: Understanding feature learning is an important open question in establishing
a mathematical foundation for deep neural networks. The Neural Feature Ansatz
(NFA) states that after training, the Gram matrix of the first-layer weights of
a deep neural network is proportional to some power $\alpha>0$ of the average
gradient outer product (AGOP) of this network with respect to its inputs.
Assuming gradient flow dynamics with balanced weight initialization, the NFA
was proven to hold throughout training for two-layer linear networks with
exponent $\alpha = 1/2$ (Radhakrishnan et al., 2024). We extend this result to
networks with $L \geq 2$ layers, showing that the NFA holds with exponent
$\alpha = 1/L$, thus demonstrating a depth dependency of the NFA. Furthermore,
we prove that for unbalanced initialization, the NFA holds asymptotically
through training if weight decay is applied. We also provide counterexamples
showing that the NFA does not hold for some network architectures with
nonlinear activations, even when these networks fit arbitrarily well the
training data. We thoroughly validate our theoretical results through numerical
experiments across a variety of optimization algorithms, weight decay rates and
initialization schemes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受迭代连接图传播(IJGP)算法启发，旨在通过神经网络方法改进#SAT问题的求解精度。

Method: 使用树分解将CNF公式编码为连接图，在连接图上执行迭代消息传递，通过注意力机制在簇内和簇间增强关键变量和簇的关注度，减少冗余计算。

Result: 实验表明Attn-JGNN模型相比其他神经网络方法取得了更好的结果。

Conclusion: 注意力增强的连接图神经网络能够有效提升#SAT问题的求解精度，注意力机制有助于关注关键变量和簇，减少冗余计算。

Abstract: We propose an Attention Enhanced Join-Graph Neural Networks(Attn-JGNN) model
for solving #SAT problems, which significantly improves the solving accuracy.
Inspired by the Iterative Join Graph Propagation (IJGP) algorithm, Attn-JGNN
uses tree decomposition to encode the CNF formula into a join-graph, then
performs iterative message passing on the join-graph, and finally approximates
the model number by learning partition functions. In order to further improve
the accuracy of the solution, we apply the attention mechanism in and between
clusters of the join-graphs, which makes Attn-JGNN pay more attention to the
key variables and clusters in probabilistic inference, and reduces the
redundant calculation. Finally, our experiments show that our Attn-JGNN model
achieves better results than other neural network methods.

### [208] [GRATING: Low-Latency and Memory-Efficient Semantic Selection on Device](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15620)
*Jiahao Zhou,Chengliang Lin,Dingji Li,Mingkai Dong,Haibo Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRATING是一个无需训练的高效推理系统，通过渐进式聚类剪枝和内存优化策略，在保持精度的同时显著降低语义top-K选择的延迟和内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义top-K选择在边缘设备上的延迟和内存需求占主导地位，但实际应用中只需要相对排名而非精确分数，且中间层的序列级稀疏性提供了剪枝机会。

Method: 采用整体前向传播，通过渐进式聚类剪枝减少延迟，使用双层滑动窗口和分块执行策略重叠I/O与计算来限制峰值内存使用。

Result: 在0.6B到8B参数的reranker上，GRATING在Apple M2和RTX 5070上分别将延迟降低高达89.0%，峰值内存降低高达94.9%，且精度无损失。在三个真实应用中，延迟降低11.6%-51.0%，内存降低18.6%-77.8%。

Conclusion: GRATING显著提高了边缘设备上语义top-K选择的效率和可部署性，证明了通过利用相对排名和序列级稀疏性可以实现高效的推理优化。

Abstract: Semantic top-K selection with cross-encoder rerankers underpins of on-device
AI services, such as retrieval-augmented generation, agent memory, and
personalized recommendation. However, its latency and memory demands dominate
end-to-end budgets on edge hardware. Revisiting the objective of top-K
selection, we reveal that only relative rankings matter, not exact
per-candidate scores. We further observe sequence-level sparsity: relative
rankings stabilize early in intermediate layers, allowing pruning opportunities
prior to completing full inference.
  Building on this insight, we propose monolithic forwarding and develop a
training-free inference system, GRATING. By maintaining a global view of all
candidates, it reduces latency through progressive cluster pruning. It also
bounds peak memory usage by strategically overlapping I/O with computation via
dual-layer sliding window and chunked execution. We evaluate GRATING against
state-of-the-art baselines on rerankers from 0.6B to 8B parameters across Apple
M2 and RTX 5070. GRATING consistently reduces latency by up to 89.0% and peak
memory by up to 94.9% in microbenchmarks, without any loss in precision. Across
three real-world on-device AI applications, GRATING lowers latency by
11.6%-51.0% and peak memory by 18.6%-77.8%, demonstrating substantial
improvements in efficiency and deployability.

TL;DR: 提出CQD-SHAP框架，使用Shapley值计算复杂查询中各个部分对特定答案排名的贡献，增强神经符号复杂查询回答的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经符号复杂查询回答方法虽然比黑盒模型更可解释，但仍无法解释查询不同部分的重要性，这会影响用户信任。

Method: 基于合作博弈论中的Shapley值构建CQD-SHAP框架，计算每个查询部分对答案排名的贡献，满足所有基本Shapley公理。

Result: 自动化评估显示该方法在必要性和充分性解释方面有效，与多种基线方法相比，对大多数查询类型都表现良好。

Conclusion: CQD-SHAP成功量化了神经预测器从不完整知识图谱中推断新知识的价值，相比仅依赖现有事实的符号方法提供了更好的可解释性。

Abstract: Complex query answering (CQA) goes beyond the well-studied link prediction
task by addressing more sophisticated queries that require multi-hop reasoning
over incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs). Research on neural and neurosymbolic
CQA methods is still an emerging field. Almost all of these methods can be
regarded as black-box models, which may raise concerns about user trust.
Although neurosymbolic approaches like CQD are slightly more interpretable,
allowing intermediate results to be tracked, the importance of different parts
of the query remains unexplained. In this paper, we propose CQD-SHAP, a novel
framework that computes the contribution of each query part to the ranking of a
specific answer. This contribution explains the value of leveraging a neural
predictor that can infer new knowledge from an incomplete KG, rather than a
symbolic approach relying solely on existing facts in the KG. CQD-SHAP is
formulated based on Shapley values from cooperative game theory and satisfies
all the fundamental Shapley axioms. Automated evaluation of these explanations
in terms of necessary and sufficient explanations, and comparisons with various
baselines, shows the effectiveness of this approach for most query types.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算子学习方法忽略了PDE的领域知识，在捕捉时间动态和训练时间范围外的泛化方面存在挑战。

Method: 采用编码器-解码器架构：编码器进行空间离散化，神经ODE捕捉潜在时间动态，解码器重建物理空间解。提出物理编码的神经ODE来融入PDE特定物理属性。

Result: 在非线性扩散-反应和Navier-Stokes方程上的数值实验显示出高精度、计算效率和在训练时间范围外的预测能力。

Conclusion: 该框架能够适应不同的编码器/解码器，并在相关PDE族间泛化，具有作为可扩展、物理编码的科学机器学习工具的潜力。

Abstract: Operator learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for developing
efficient surrogate models to solve partial differential equations (PDEs).
However, existing approaches often overlook the domain knowledge inherent in
the underlying PDEs and hence suffer from challenges in capturing temporal
dynamics and generalization issues beyond training time frames. This paper
introduces a deep neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) operator network
framework, termed NODE-ONet, to alleviate these limitations. The framework
adopts an encoder-decoder architecture comprising three core components: an
encoder that spatially discretizes input functions, a neural ODE capturing
latent temporal dynamics, and a decoder reconstructing solutions in physical
spaces. Theoretically, error analysis for the encoder-decoder architecture is
investigated. Computationally, we propose novel physics-encoded neural ODEs to
incorporate PDE-specific physical properties. Such well-designed neural ODEs
significantly reduce the framework's complexity while enhancing numerical
efficiency, robustness, applicability, and generalization capacity. Numerical
experiments on nonlinear diffusion-reaction and Navier-Stokes equations
demonstrate high accuracy, computational efficiency, and prediction
capabilities beyond training time frames. Additionally, the framework's
flexibility to accommodate diverse encoders/decoders and its ability to
generalize across related PDE families further underscore its potential as a
scalable, physics-encoded tool for scientific machine learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tsetlin Machine在资源受限设备上具有高速推理能力，其逻辑驱动操作适合在现代CPU架构上并行执行，因此需要优化实现以充分利用这一特性。

Method: 1) 使用指令级位操作进行紧凑模型表示和加速处理；2) 引入基于AND子句评估的早期退出机制避免不必要计算；3) 提出文字重排序策略最大化早期退出概率，通过统计分析和Tsetlin Automata动作在训练后推理前阶段应用。

Result: 在ARM处理器上的gem5模拟器实验显示，相比传统基于整数的TM实现，推理时间减少了高达96.71%，同时保持相当的代码密度。

Conclusion: 所提出的优化实现显著提升了Tsetlin Machine的推理效率，特别适合资源受限设备，为实际部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The Tsetlin Machine (TM) offers high-speed inference on resource-constrained
devices such as CPUs. Its logic-driven operations naturally lend themselves to
parallel execution on modern CPU architectures. Motivated by this, we propose
an efficient software implementation of the TM by leveraging instruction-level
bitwise operations for compact model representation and accelerated processing.
To further improve inference speed, we introduce an early exit mechanism, which
exploits the TM's AND-based clause evaluation to avoid unnecessary
computations. Building upon this, we propose a literal Reorder strategy
designed to maximize the likelihood of early exits. This strategy is applied
during a post-training, pre-inference stage through statistical analysis of all
literals and the corresponding actions of their associated Tsetlin Automata
(TA), introducing negligible runtime overhead. Experimental results using the
gem5 simulator with an ARM processor show that our optimized implementation
reduces inference time by up to 96.71% compared to the conventional
integer-based TM implementations while maintaining comparable code density.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有乘法自由模型如DLGNs在训练时计算成本高，且难以扩展到更多输入的逻辑块，需要更高效的梯度学习方法。

Method: 使用Walsh变换辅助的概率查找表方法，通过梯度学习逻辑门组合，大幅减少可训练参数数量。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上比DLGNs收敛更快，同时保持相当的精度，为扩展到更高输入逻辑块提供了潜力。

Conclusion: WARP-LUTs为现代FPGA上的高效部署和实时科学应用提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Fast and efficient machine learning is of growing interest to the scientific
community and has spurred significant research into novel model architectures
and hardware-aware design. Recent hard? and software co-design approaches have
demonstrated impressive results with entirely multiplication-free models.
Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (DLGNs), for instance, provide a
gradient-based framework for learning optimal combinations of low-level logic
gates, setting state-of-the-art trade-offs between accuracy, resource usage,
and latency. However, these models suffer from high computational cost during
training and do not generalize well to logic blocks with more inputs. In this
work, we introduce Walsh-Assisted Relaxation for Probabilistic Look-Up Tables
(WARP-LUTs) - a novel gradient-based method that efficiently learns
combinations of logic gates with substantially fewer trainable parameters. We
demonstrate that WARP-LUTs achieve significantly faster convergence on CIFAR-10
compared to DLGNs, while maintaining comparable accuracy. Furthermore, our
approach suggests potential for extension to higher-input logic blocks,
motivating future research on extremely efficient deployment on modern FPGAs
and its real-time science applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CarBoN是一种测试时校准框架，通过自适应调整模型参数来提升推理任务的性能，无需重新训练大语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时缩放方法（如Best-of-N采样）在N增加时收益递减，效率低下。

Method: 提出两阶段方法：先探索解空间，然后通过学习输入特定的温度T和加性偏移向量δ来校准logits，引导生成更可靠的推理路径。

Result: 在MATH-500和AIME-2024上的实验表明，CarBoN效率提升4倍，在固定预算下通常能达到更高准确率。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效平衡输出多样性和正确性，并可推广到束搜索等步骤级采样策略。

Abstract: Allocating more computation during inference time (test-time scaling)
improves language model performance, especially for reasoning tasks. However,
popular methods like Best-of-$N$ sampling often show diminishing returns as $N$
increases. To address this inefficiency, we introduce a general test-time
calibration framework that adaptively modifies the model toward high-reward
reasoning paths, with theoretical guarantees of improving the lower bound of
expected reward under finite sampling, all without large language model (LLM)
retraining. Within this framework, we propose CarBoN (Calibrated Best-of-$N$),
a two-phase method that first explores the solution space and then learns a
calibration of the logits via an input-specific temperature $T$ and additive
shift vector $\delta$, guiding generation toward more reliable reasoning.
Experiments on MATH-500 and AIME-2024 show that CarBoN improves efficiency,
with up to $4\times$ fewer rollouts to reach the same accuracy, while often
achieving higher accuracy under fixed budgets. We also analyze the
complementary roles of $T$ and $\delta$ in balancing output diversity and
correctness, and demonstrate that the framework also generalizes to step-level
sampling strategies such as beam search. For more information, please refer to

Motivation: 传统使用有限元方法分析IPMSM转子形状计算成本高，需要寻找更高效的替代方法。

Method: 开发了自定义深度学习模型KS-Net，并与Cubic SVM、Quadratic SVM、Fine KNN、Cosine KNN、Fine Tree等算法在9000个样本的平衡数据集上使用10折交叉验证进行比较。

Conclusion: 数据驱动方法可以高精度预测IPMSM转子形状，为电机设计过程加速、自动化转子识别系统和数据驱动的故障诊断提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: The demand for high efficiency and precise control in electric drive systems
has led to the widespread adoption of Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous
Motors (IPMSMs). The performance of these motors is significantly influenced by
rotor geometry. Traditionally, rotor shape analysis has been conducted using
the finite element method (FEM), which involves high computational costs. This
study aims to classify the rotor shape (2D type, V type, Nabla type) of IPMSMs
using electromagnetic parameters through machine learning-based methods and to
demonstrate the applicability of this approach as an alternative to classical
methods. In this context, a custom deep learning model, KS-Net, developed by
the user, was comparatively evaluated against Cubic SVM, Quadratic SVM, Fine
KNN, Cosine KNN, and Fine Tree algorithms. The balanced dataset, consisting of
9,000 samples, was tested using 10-fold cross-validation, and performance
metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were employed. The
results indicate that the Cubic SVM and Quadratic SVM algorithms classified all
samples flawlessly, achieving 100% accuracy, while the KS-Net model achieved
99.98% accuracy with only two misclassifications, demonstrating competitiveness
with classical methods. This study shows that the rotor shape of IPMSMs can be
predicted with high accuracy using data-driven approaches, offering a fast and
cost-effective alternative to FEM-based analyses. The findings provide a solid
foundation for accelerating motor design processes, developing automated rotor
identification systems, and enabling data-driven fault diagnosis in engineering
applications.

Conclusion: CAP方法在约束特征空间中有效生成对抗扰动，并提供了从数据中学习特征约束的原则性程序，适用于结构化输入空间的各种领域。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in a wide range of
classification tasks. However, they remain highly susceptible to adversarial
examples - inputs that are subtly perturbed to induce misclassification while
appearing unchanged to humans. Among various attack strategies, Universal
Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) have emerged as a powerful tool for both
stress testing model robustness and facilitating scalable adversarial training.
Despite their effectiveness, most existing UAP methods neglect domain specific
constraints that govern feature relationships. Violating such constraints, such
as debt to income ratios in credit scoring or packet flow invariants in network
communication, can render adversarial examples implausible or easily
detectable, thereby limiting their real world applicability.
  In this work, we advance universal adversarial attacks to constrained feature
spaces by formulating an augmented Lagrangian based min max optimization
problem that enforces multiple, potentially complex constraints of varying
importance. We propose Constrained Adversarial Perturbation (CAP), an efficient
algorithm that solves this problem using a gradient based alternating
optimization strategy. We evaluate CAP across diverse domains including
finance, IT networks, and cyber physical systems, and demonstrate that it
achieves higher attack success rates while significantly reducing runtime
compared to existing baselines. Our approach also generalizes seamlessly to
individual adversarial perturbations, where we observe similar strong
performance gains. Finally, we introduce a principled procedure for learning
feature constraints directly from data, enabling broad applicability across
domains with structured input spaces.

TL;DR: ProofOptimizer是一个通过专家迭代和强化学习训练的语言模型，专门用于简化Lean证明，无需人工监督，能显著压缩证明长度并提高验证效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经定理证明生成的证明过长，难以被人类理解，限制了数学洞察力。现有方法在处理RL训练证明器生成的长证明时效果不佳，且训练数据稀缺。

Method: 通过专家迭代和强化学习训练ProofOptimizer模型，使用Lean验证简化并提供训练信号，在推理时采用迭代证明缩短工作流程。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，ProofOptimizer显著压缩了证明长度：miniF2F减少87%，PutnamBench减少57%，Seed-Prover的IMO 2025证明减少49%。简化后的证明在Lean中验证更快，且作为训练数据能进一步提升下游证明器性能。

Conclusion: ProofOptimizer是首个无需人工监督就能简化Lean证明的语言模型，有效解决了证明过长的问题，提高了证明的可理解性和实用性。

Abstract: Neural theorem proving has advanced rapidly in the past year, reaching IMO
gold-medalist capabilities and producing formal proofs that span thousands of
lines. Although such proofs are mechanically verified by formal systems like
Lean, their excessive length renders them difficult for humans to comprehend
and limits their usefulness for mathematical insight. Proof simplification is
therefore a critical bottleneck. Yet, training data for this task is scarce,
and existing methods -- mainly agentic scaffolding with off-the-shelf LLMs --
struggle with the extremely long proofs generated by RL-trained provers. We
introduce ProofOptimizer, the first language model trained to simplify Lean
proofs without requiring additional human supervision. ProofOptimizer is
trained via expert iteration and reinforcement learning, using Lean to verify
simplifications and provide training signal. At inference time, it operates
within an iterative proof-shortening workflow, progressively reducing proof
length. Experiments show that ProofOptimizer substantially compresses proofs
generated by state-of-the-art RL-trained provers on standard benchmarks,
reducing proof length by 87% on miniF2F, 57% on PutnamBench, and 49% on
Seed-Prover's IMO 2025 proofs. Beyond conciseness, the simplified proofs check
faster in Lean and further improve downstream prover performance when reused as
training data for supervised finetuning.

Conclusion: ProSh是一种有效的无模型安全RL算法，能在训练和部署时提供正式的安全保证，特别适用于确定性环境。

Abstract: Safety is a major concern in reinforcement learning (RL): we aim at
developing RL systems that not only perform optimally, but are also safe to
deploy by providing formal guarantees about their safety. To this end, we
introduce Probabilistic Shielding via Risk Augmentation (ProSh), a model-free
algorithm for safe reinforcement learning under cost constraints. ProSh
augments the Constrained MDP state space with a risk budget and enforces safety
by applying a shield to the agent's policy distribution using a learned cost
critic. The shield ensures that all sampled actions remain safe in expectation.
We also show that optimality is preserved when the environment is
deterministic. Since ProSh is model-free, safety during training depends on the
knowledge we have acquired about the environment. We provide a tight
upper-bound on the cost in expectation, depending only on the backup-critic
accuracy, that is always satisfied during training. Under mild, practically
achievable assumptions, ProSh guarantees safety even at training time, as shown
in the experiments.

*Mahyar Alinejad,Alvaro Velasquez,Yue Wang,George Atia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于自动机偏好的强化学习方法，用DFA结构生成轨迹偏好来学习奖励函数，替代传统奖励工程，在时序依赖任务中表现优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法在处理具有复杂历史依赖奖励结构的环境时面临挑战，需要手动设计奖励函数，过程繁琐且效率低下。

Method: 使用确定性有限自动机(DFA)生成轨迹偏好来学习奖励函数，提出静态方法直接使用学习到的奖励函数进行策略优化，以及动态方法通过迭代更新持续优化奖励函数和策略。

Result: 在离散和连续环境中的实验表明，该方法能够学习处理时序依赖任务的有效策略，性能优于传统奖励工程和基于自动机的基线方法。

Conclusion: 基于自动机的偏好方法为处理非马尔可夫奖励提供了可扩展、高效且无需人工干预的替代方案，并在标准假设下具有收敛保证。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) in environments with complex, history-dependent
reward structures poses significant challenges for traditional methods. In this
work, we introduce a novel approach that leverages automaton-based feedback to
guide the learning process, replacing explicit reward functions with
preferences derived from a deterministic finite automaton (DFA). Unlike
conventional approaches that use automata for direct reward specification, our
method employs the structure of the DFA to generate preferences over
trajectories that are used to learn a reward function, eliminating the need for
manual reward engineering. Our framework introduces a static approach that uses
the learned reward function directly for policy optimization and a dynamic
approach that involves continuous refining of the reward function and policy
through iterative updates until convergence.
  Our experiments in both discrete and continuous environments demonstrate that
our approach enables the RL agent to learn effective policies for tasks with
temporal dependencies, outperforming traditional reward engineering and
automaton-based baselines such as reward machines and LTL-guided methods. Our
results highlight the advantages of automaton-based preferences in handling
non-Markovian rewards, offering a scalable, efficient, and human-independent
alternative to traditional reward modeling. We also provide a convergence
guarantee showing that under standard assumptions our automaton-guided
preference-based framework learns a policy that is near-optimal with respect to
the true non-Markovian objective.

*Nayan Kumar Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文评估了图神经网络(GNN)和3D U-Net作为参数化工字梁有限元分析(FEA)的替代模型，发现GNN显著优于U-Net，其中消息传递神经网络(MPNN)和图变换器表现最佳，物理信息神经网络(PINN)框架显著提升了泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有限元分析计算成本高昂，不适合设计优化问题，深度学习模型可以成为解决方案，但需要选择能够准确模拟FEA的架构。

Method: 采用课程学习策略，先在数据上预训练，然后进行物理信息微调；引入基于Navier-Cauchy方程的物理信息神经网络(PINN)框架来强制执行物理定律；比较了GNN和3D U-Net架构。

Result: GNN显著优于U-Net，最差的GCN框架相对L2误差为8.7%，而最佳U-Net为13.0%；MPNN和图变换器分别达到3.5%和2.6%的误差；PINN将误差降低了11.3%；图变换器最准确但推理速度比MPNN PINN慢37.5%。

Conclusion: PINN增强的MPNN(MPNN PINN)提供了最实用的解决方案，在预测性能、模型大小和推理速度之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Although Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is an integral part of the product
design lifecycle, the analysis is computationally expensive, making it
unsuitable for many design optimization problems. The deep learning models can
be a great solution. However, selecting the architecture that emulates the FEA
with great accuracy is a challenge. This paper presents a comprehensive
evaluation of graph neural networks (GNNs) and 3D U-Nets as surrogates for FEA
of parametric I-beams. We introduce a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)
framework, governed by the Navier Cauchy equations, to enforce physical laws.
Crucially, we demonstrate that a curriculum learning strategy, pretraining on
data followed by physics informed fine tuning, is essential for stabilizing
training. Our results show that GNNs fundamentally outperform the U-Net. Even
the worst performer among GNNs, the GCN framework, achieved a relative L2 error
of 8.7% while the best framework among U Net, U Net with attention mechanism
trained on high resolution data, achieved 13.0% score. Among the graph-based
architectures, the Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNN) and Graph
Transformers achieved the highest accuracy, achieving a relative L2 score of
3.5% and 2.6% respectively. The inclusion of physics fundamental laws (PINN)
significantly improved the generalization, reducing error by up to 11.3% on
high-signal tasks. While the Graph Transformer is the most accurate model, it
is more 37.5% slower during inference when compared to second best model, MPNN
PINN. The PINN enhanced MPNN (MPNN PINN) provides the most practical solution.
It offers a good compromise between predictive performance, model size, and
inference speed.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Sphere-Adaptive Mixup (SAMix)方法，通过自适应混合策略改进基于神经坍缩的持续学习方法，在提升性能的同时改善模型校准，减少过自信和遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续学习方法主要关注减轻遗忘和提高准确率，但忽视了网络校准这一重要方面。神经坍缩现象在持续学习中显示出优势，但很少有工作致力于改进持续模型的校准以实现更可靠的预测。

Method: 提出Sphere-Adaptive Mixup (SAMix)，一种针对神经坍缩方法定制的自适应混合策略。该方法根据神经坍缩下特征空间的几何特性调整混合过程，确保更稳健的正则化和对齐。

Result: 实验表明，SAMix显著提升了性能，在持续学习中超越了最先进方法，同时改善了模型校准。该方法提高了跨任务准确率和预测的可靠性。

Conclusion: SAMix是持续学习系统稳健性方面的一个有前景的进展，能够同时增强准确性和预测可靠性。

Abstract: While most continual learning methods focus on mitigating forgetting and
improving accuracy, they often overlook the critical aspect of network
calibration, despite its importance. Neural collapse, a phenomenon where
last-layer features collapse to their class means, has demonstrated advantages
in continual learning by reducing feature-classifier misalignment. Few works
aim to improve the calibration of continual models for more reliable
predictions. Our work goes a step further by proposing a novel method that not
only enhances calibration but also improves performance by reducing
overconfidence, mitigating forgetting, and increasing accuracy. We introduce
Sphere-Adaptive Mixup (SAMix), an adaptive mixup strategy tailored for neural
collapse-based methods. SAMix adapts the mixing process to the geometric
properties of feature spaces under neural collapse, ensuring more robust
regularization and alignment. Experiments show that SAMix significantly boosts
performance, surpassing SOTA methods in continual learning while also improving
model calibration. SAMix enhances both across-task accuracy and the broader
reliability of predictions, making it a promising advancement for robust
continual learning systems.

Motivation: 现有的预训练时间序列模型主要关注单变量预测，限制了其在包含多变量数据和协变量的真实场景中的应用。

Method: 采用组注意力机制，通过在包含多样化多变量结构的合成数据集上进行训练，实现跨多个时间序列的高效信息共享和上下文学习。

Conclusion: Chronos-2的上下文学习能力使其成为一个通用预测模型，可以直接用于真实世界的预测流程中。

Abstract: Pretrained time series models have enabled inference-only forecasting systems
that produce accurate predictions without task-specific training. However,
existing approaches largely focus on univariate forecasting, limiting their
applicability in real-world scenarios where multivariate data and covariates
play a crucial role. We present Chronos-2, a pretrained model capable of
handling univariate, multivariate, and covariate-informed forecasting tasks in
a zero-shot manner. Chronos-2 employs a group attention mechanism that
facilitates in-context learning (ICL) through efficient information sharing
across multiple time series within a group, which may represent sets of related
series, variates of a multivariate series, or targets and covariates in a
forecasting task. These general capabilities are achieved through training on
synthetic datasets that impose diverse multivariate structures on univariate
series. Chronos-2 delivers state-of-the-art performance across three
comprehensive benchmarks: fev-bench, GIFT-Eval, and Chronos Benchmark II. On
fev-bench, which emphasizes multivariate and covariate-informed forecasting,
Chronos-2's universal ICL capabilities lead to substantial improvements over
existing models. On tasks involving covariates, it consistently outperforms
baselines by a wide margin. Case studies in the energy and retail domains
further highlight its practical advantages. The in-context learning
capabilities of Chronos-2 establish it as a general-purpose forecasting model
that can be used "as is" in real-world forecasting pipelines.

TL;DR: 论文提出SNOO优化器，通过将Nesterov动量应用于伪梯度，在非分布式设置中实现了1.5-2.5倍的计算效率提升，且改进效果随模型规模增大而增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiLoCo优化器在非分布式设置中表现出色，但其有效性来源尚不明确。本文旨在实证分析DiLoCo成功的关键因素，并开发更高效的优化技术。

Method: 提出Step-K Nesterov Outer Optimizer (SNOO)，在Lookahead双循环框架基础上，将Nesterov动量应用于伪梯度更新慢权重。

Result: SNOO在非分布式设置中达到1.5-2.5倍计算效率提升，训练FLOPs规模达1e23，且改进效果随模型规模增大而增强。

Conclusion: SNOO因其计算和内存开销小且兼容模型分片，可实际增强包括AdamW和Muon在内的多种内部优化器。

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has driven the demand
for more efficient optimization techniques. Among these, the Lookahead family
of optimizers employs a two-loop framework, maintaining fast and slow sets of
model weights. Multiple inner optimizer steps on the fast weights produce a
trajectory - the pseudo-gradient - that is used to update the slow weights.
DiLoCo, a notable example originally designed for distributed training, applies
Nesterov momentum to the averaged pseudo-gradient from multiple workers,
claiming to even outperform AdamW in a non-distributed setup. In this paper, we
empirically show that DiLoCo's surprising effectiveness stems primarily from
applying Nesterov momentum to the pseudo-gradient, which improves training in a
non-distributed setting. We call this Lookahead variant the Step-$K$ Nesterov
Outer Optimizer (SNOO). We demonstrate that SNOO achieves compute factor gains
of 1.5 - 2.5$\times$ in a non-distributed setting up to a scale of 1e23
training FLOPs, with improvements that increase with model size. Because of its
minimal compute and memory overhead and compatibility with model sharding, SNOO
is a practical enhancement for a variety of inner optimizers, including AdamW
and Muon.

Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize fields like quantum
optimization and quantum machine learning. However, current quantum devices are
hindered by noise, reducing their reliability. A key challenge in gate-based
quantum computing is improving the reliability of quantum circuits, measured by
process fidelity, during the transpilation process, particularly in the routing
stage. In this paper, we address the Fidelity Maximization in Routing Stage
(FMRS) problem by introducing FIDDLE, a novel learning framework comprising two
modules: a Gaussian Process-based surrogate model to estimate process fidelity
with limited training samples and a reinforcement learning module to optimize
routing. Our approach is the first to directly maximize process fidelity,
outperforming traditional methods that rely on indirect metrics such as circuit
depth or gate count. We rigorously evaluate FIDDLE by comparing it with
state-of-the-art fidelity estimation techniques and routing optimization
methods. The results demonstrate that our proposed surrogate model is able to
provide a better estimation on the process fidelity compared to existing
learning techniques, and our end-to-end framework significantly improves the
process fidelity of quantum circuits across various noise models.

Conclusion: TRON架构具有生物学基础和可解释性，正在收集跨物种转录组/表型数据以获得实验验证。

Abstract: We present Transfer Orthology Networks (TRON), a novel neural network
architecture designed for cross-species transfer learning. TRON leverages
orthologous relationships, represented as a bipartite graph between species, to
guide knowledge transfer. Specifically, we prepend a learned species conversion
layer, whose weights are masked by the biadjacency matrix of this bipartite
graph, to a pre-trained feedforward neural network that predicts a phenotype
from gene expression data in a source species. This allows for efficient
transfer of knowledge to a target species by learning a linear transformation
that maps gene expression from the source to the target species' gene space.
The learned weights of this conversion layer offer a potential avenue for
interpreting functional orthology, providing insights into how genes across
species contribute to the phenotype of interest. TRON offers a biologically
grounded and interpretable approach to cross-species transfer learning, paving
the way for more effective utilization of available transcriptomic data. We are
in the process of collecting cross-species transcriptomic/phenotypic data to
gain experimental validation of the TRON architecture.

Abstract: Random Utility Models (RUMs) are a classical framework for modeling user
preferences and play a key role in reward modeling for Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback (RLHF). However, a crucial shortcoming of many of these
techniques is the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) assumption,
which collapses \emph{all} human preferences to a universal underlying utility
function, yielding a coarse approximation of the range of human preferences. On
the other hand, statistical and computational guarantees for models avoiding
this assumption are scarce. In this paper, we investigate the statistical and
computational challenges of learning a \emph{correlated} probit model, a
fundamental RUM that avoids the IIA assumption. First, we establish that the
classical data collection paradigm of pairwise preference data is
\emph{fundamentally insufficient} to learn correlational information,
explaining the lack of statistical and computational guarantees in this
setting. Next, we demonstrate that \emph{best-of-three} preference data
provably overcomes these shortcomings, and devise a statistically and
computationally efficient estimator with near-optimal performance. These
results highlight the benefits of higher-order preference data in learning
correlated utilities, allowing for more fine-grained modeling of human
preferences. Finally, we validate these theoretical guarantees on several
real-world datasets, demonstrating improved personalization of human
preferences.

Abstract: Recent research has shown that optimization proxies can be trained to high
fidelity, achieving average optimality gaps under 1% for large-scale problems.
However, worst-case analyses show that there exist in-distribution queries that
result in orders of magnitude higher optimality gap, making it difficult to
trust the predictions in practice. This paper aims at striking a balance
between classical solvers and optimization proxies in order to enable
trustworthy deployments with interpretable speed-optimality tradeoffs based on
a user-defined optimality threshold. To this end, the paper proposes a hybrid
solver that leverages duality theory to efficiently bound the optimality gap of
predictions, falling back to a classical solver for queries where optimality
cannot be certified. To improve the achieved speedup of the hybrid solver, the
paper proposes an alternative training procedure that combines the primal and
dual proxy training. Experiments on large-scale transmission systems show that
the hybrid solver is highly scalable. The proposed hybrid solver achieves
speedups of over 1000x compared to a parallelized simplex-based solver while
guaranteeing a maximum optimality gap of 2%.

Abstract: Real-world settings where language models (LMs) are deployed -- in domains
spanning healthcare, finance, and other forms of knowledge work -- require
models to grapple with incomplete information and reason under uncertainty. Yet
most LM evaluations focus on problems with well-defined answers and success
criteria. This gap exists in part because natural problems involving
uncertainty are difficult to construct: given that LMs have access to most of
the same knowledge as humans, it is non-trivial to design questions for which
LMs will struggle to produce correct answers, but which humans can answer
reliably. As a result, LM performance on reasoning under uncertainty remains
poorly characterized. To address this gap, we introduce OpenEstimate, an
extensible, multi-domain benchmark for evaluating LMs on numerical estimation
tasks that require models to synthesize significant amounts of background
information and express predictions as probabilistic priors. We assess these
priors for accuracy and calibration, quantifying their usefulness relative to
samples from the true distribution of interest. Across six frontier LMs, we
find that LM-elicited priors are often inaccurate and overconfident.
Performance improves modestly depending on how uncertainty is elicited from the
model, but is largely unaffected by changes in sampling strategy, reasoning
effort, or prompt design. The OpenEstimate benchmark thus offers a challenging
evaluation for frontier LMs and a platform for developing models that are
better at probabilistic estimation and reasoning under uncertainty.

Abstract: Procedural content generation (PCG) has become an increasingly popular
technique in game development, allowing developers to generate dynamic,
replayable, and scalable environments with reduced manual effort. In this
study, a novel method for procedural level design using Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL) within a Unity-based 3D environment is proposed. The system
comprises two agents: a hummingbird agent, acting as a solver, and a floating
island agent, responsible for generating and placing collectible objects
(flowers) on the terrain in a realistic and context-aware manner. The
hummingbird is trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm
from the Unity ML-Agents toolkit. It learns to navigate through the terrain
efficiently, locate flowers, and collect them while adapting to the
ever-changing procedural layout of the island. The island agent is also trained
using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. It learns to generate
flower layouts based on observed obstacle positions, the hummingbird's initial
state, and performance feedback from previous episodes. The interaction between
these agents leads to emergent behavior and robust generalization across
various environmental configurations. The results demonstrate that the approach
not only produces effective and efficient agent behavior but also opens up new
opportunities for autonomous game level design driven by machine learning. This
work highlights the potential of DRL in enabling intelligent agents to both
generate and solve content in virtual environments, pushing the boundaries of
what AI can contribute to creative game development processes.

limited. Building on the critical rationalism of Popper and Deutsch, we
challenge the Platonic Representation Hypothesis. Observationally equivalent
worlds can diverge under interventions, so observational adequacy alone cannot
guarantee interventional competence. We begin by laying foundations,
definitions of knowledge, learning, intelligence, counterfactual competence and
AGI, and then analyze the limits of observational learning that motivate an
error centric shift. We recast the problem as three questions about how
explicit and implicit errors evolve under an agent's actions, which errors are
unreachable within a fixed hypothesis space, and how conjecture and criticism
expand that space. From these questions we propose Causal Mechanics, a
mechanisms first program in which hypothesis space change is a first class
operation and probabilistic structure is used when useful rather than presumed.
We advance structural principles that make error discovery and correction
tractable, including a differential Locality and Autonomy Principle for modular
interventions, a gauge invariant form of Independent Causal Mechanisms for
separability, and the Compositional Autonomy Principle for analogy
preservation, together with actionable diagnostics. The aim is a scaffold for
systems that can convert unreachable errors into reachable ones and correct
them.

TL;DR: HugAgent是一个用于评估AI模型能否模拟个体人类推理风格的基准测试，包含合成和人类双轨设计，旨在解决当前LLM仅反映群体共识而忽略个体推理差异的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型虽然能近似人类响应，但主要反映群体共识，无法捕捉个体推理风格和信念轨迹的独特性，需要开发能模拟更接近人类个体推理的AI系统。

Method: 采用双轨设计：合成轨道用于规模化和系统性压力测试，人类轨道用于收集生态有效的"出声思考"推理数据，通过预测特定个体在新情境中的推理和信念更新来评估模型。

Result: 实验表明最先进的LLM在个体适应方面仍存在持续差距，HugAgent成为首个可扩展的基准测试，用于对齐机器推理与人类思维的个体性。

Conclusion: HugAgent为推进机器推理与人类个体思维的对齐提供了首个可扩展基准，揭示了当前模型在捕捉个体推理风格方面的局限性，并开源了相关工具。

Abstract: Simulating human reasoning in open-ended tasks has been a long-standing
aspiration in AI and cognitive science. While large language models now
approximate human responses at scale, they remain tuned to population-level
consensus, often erasing the individuality of reasoning styles and belief
trajectories. To advance the vision of more human-like reasoning in machines,
we introduce HugAgent (Human-Grounded Agent Benchmark), a benchmark for
average-to-individual reasoning adaptation. The task is to predict how a
specific person would reason and update their beliefs in novel scenarios, given
partial evidence of their past views. HugAgent adopts a dual-track design: a
synthetic track for scale and systematic stress tests, and a human track for
ecologically valid, "out-loud" reasoning data. This design enables scalable,
reproducible evaluation of intra-agent fidelity: whether models can capture not
just what people believe, but how their reasoning evolves. Experiments with
state-of-the-art LLMs reveal persistent adaptation gaps, positioning HugAgent
as the first extensible benchmark for aligning machine reasoning with the
individuality of human thought. Our benchmark and chatbot are open-sourced as
HugAgent (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HugAgent) and TraceYourThinking

Motivation: 解决真实工作环境中情绪识别因缺乏大规模、长期自然收集数据集而面临的挑战。

Method: 收集38名员工30.5个月的面部表情数据，使用深度学习进行情绪识别，计算32种情绪指标，并进行技术验证和基线实验。

Result: 数据集成功复现已知心理模式（周末效应+192%效价改善），员工离职预测AUC=1.0，情绪分类准确率91.2%，效价预测R²=0.84。

Conclusion: 这是目前公开可用的最大、最长的纵向工作场所情绪数据集，支持情绪识别、情感动态建模、情绪传染、离职预测等研究。

Abstract: Automated emotion recognition in real-world workplace settings remains a
challenging problem in affective computing due to the scarcity of large-scale,
longitudinal datasets collected in naturalistic environments. We present a
novel dataset comprising 733,651 facial expression records from 38 employees
collected over 30.5 months (November 2021 to May 2024) in an authentic office
environment. Each record contains seven emotion probabilities (neutral, happy,
sad, surprised, fear, disgusted, angry) derived from deep learning-based facial
expression recognition, along with comprehensive metadata including job roles,
employment outcomes, and personality traits. The dataset uniquely spans the
COVID-19 pandemic period, capturing emotional responses to major societal
events including the Shanghai lockdown and policy changes. We provide 32
extended emotional metrics computed using established affective science
methods, including valence, arousal, volatility, predictability, inertia, and
emotional contagion strength. Technical validation demonstrates high data
quality through successful replication of known psychological patterns (weekend
effect: +192% valence improvement, p < 0.001; diurnal rhythm validated) and
perfect predictive validity for employee turnover (AUC=1.0). Baseline
experiments using Random Forest and LSTM models achieve 91.2% accuracy for
emotion classification and R2 = 0.84 for valence prediction. This is the
largest and longest longitudinal workplace emotion dataset publicly available,
enabling research in emotion recognition, affective dynamics modeling,
emotional contagion, turnover prediction, and emotion-aware system design.

TL;DR: 本文提出AGI评估应使用因果中心性权重和集群稳定性指数，而非对称权重和快照测试，以更好衡量通用智能的持久性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AGI评估使用对称权重和快照分数，但人类智能研究表明不同领域重要性不同，且快照测试无法区分持久能力和脆弱表现。

Method: 提出两个评估扩展：基于CHC理论的中心性优先分数和集群稳定性指数家族，分别衡量领域因果中心性和能力持久性、学习持久性、纠错能力。

Result: 这些扩展保持了多领域广度，同时减少了脆弱性和博弈行为，提供了更稳健的AGI评估框架。

Conclusion: 通用智能应理解为稳态属性集群，AGI评估应关注能力在扰动下的持久共现，并提供了可操作的黑盒测试协议。

Abstract: Contemporary AGI evaluations report multidomain capability profiles, yet they
typically assign symmetric weights and rely on snapshot scores. This creates
two problems: (i) equal weighting treats all domains as equally important when
human intelligence research suggests otherwise, and (ii) snapshot testing can't
distinguish durable capabilities from brittle performances that collapse under
delay or stress. I argue that general intelligence -- in humans and potentially
in machines -- is better understood as a homeostatic property cluster: a set of
abilities plus the mechanisms that keep those abilities co-present under
perturbation. On this view, AGI evaluation should weight domains by their
causal centrality (their contribution to cluster stability) and require
evidence of persistence across sessions. I propose two battery-compatible
extensions: a centrality-prior score that imports CHC-derived weights with
transparent sensitivity analysis, and a Cluster Stability Index family that
separates profile persistence, durable learning, and error correction. These
additions preserve multidomain breadth while reducing brittleness and gaming. I
close with testable predictions and black-box protocols labs can adopt without
architectural access.

Motivation: 在大数据时代，从海量异构复杂关联的多维数据中提取深度洞察面临挑战。LLM存在幻觉问题且难以实时更新，知识图谱静态特性限制了动态交互分析能力。

Method: 利用LLM代理从非结构化数据自动提取产品数据，实时构建和可视化知识图谱，通过交互平台支持用户深度探索分析图节点。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在产品生态系统分析、关系挖掘和用户驱动探索性分析方面具有显著优势。

Conclusion: 为多维数据分析提供了新思路和工具，构建了动态协作的分析生态系统。

Abstract: In the current era of big data, extracting deep insights from massive,
heterogeneous, and complexly associated multi-dimensional data has become a
significant challenge. Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in natural
language understanding and generation, but still suffer from "hallucination"
issues when processing structured knowledge and are difficult to update in
real-time. Although Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can explicitly store structured
knowledge, their static nature limits dynamic interaction and analytical
capabilities. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional data analysis
method based on the interactions between LLM agents and KGs, constructing a
dynamic, collaborative analytical ecosystem. This method utilizes LLM agents to
automatically extract product data from unstructured data, constructs and
visualizes the KG in real-time, and supports users in deep exploration and
analysis of graph nodes through an interactive platform. Experimental results
show that this method has significant advantages in product ecosystem analysis,
relationship mining, and user-driven exploratory analysis, providing new ideas
and tools for multi-dimensional data analysis.

TL;DR: KG-Agent是一个经验驱动的学习框架，通过将像素级GUI交互构建为状态-动作知识图，解决LLM智能体在无API环境中的效率瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有软件大多缺乏可访问的API，智能体只能通过像素级GUI操作，导致决策短视、依赖试错，阻碍技能获取和长期规划。

Method: 构建状态-动作知识图(SA-KG)，将功能相似但视觉不同的GUI状态连接起来；设计基于图拓扑的混合内在奖励机制，结合状态价值奖励和新颖性奖励。

Result: 在Civilization V和Slay the Spire两个复杂GUI决策环境中，相比最先进方法显著提升了探索效率和策略深度。

Conclusion: KG-Agent通过结构化经验表示和混合奖励机制，有效解决了无API环境下智能体的探索效率和长期规划问题。

Abstract: Most existing software lacks accessible Application Programming Interfaces
(APIs), requiring agents to operate solely through pixel-based Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs). In this API-free setting, large language model (LLM)-based
agents face severe efficiency bottlenecks: limited to local visual experiences,
they make myopic decisions and rely on inefficient trial-and-error, hindering
both skill acquisition and long-term planning. To address these challenges, we
propose KG-Agent, an experience-driven learning framework that structures an
agent's raw pixel-level interactions into a persistent State-Action Knowledge
Graph (SA-KG). KG-Agent overcomes inefficient exploration by linking
functionally similar but visually distinct GUI states, forming a rich
neighborhood of experience that enables the agent to generalize from a diverse
set of historical strategies. To support long-horizon reasoning, we design a
hybrid intrinsic reward mechanism based on the graph topology, combining a
state value reward for exploiting known high-value pathways with a novelty
reward that encourages targeted exploration. This approach decouples strategic
planning from pure discovery, allowing the agent to effectively value setup
actions with delayed gratification. We evaluate KG-Agent in two complex,
open-ended GUI-based decision-making environments (Civilization V and Slay the
Spire), demonstrating significant improvements in exploration efficiency and
strategic depth over the state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有智能体系统主要存储文本信息，忽视了多模态信号的重要性。受人类记忆多模态特性的启发，希望构建一个符合认知科学中人类记忆理念的多模态智能体系统。

Method: 系统包含4个循环阶段：编码（理解输入）、存储记忆（保存重要信息）、检索（从记忆中搜索相关上下文）、行动（执行任务）。使用语义标签概念化信息，并将标签与其上下文关联存储在图结构的多模态上下文记忆中，实现高效的概念驱动检索。

Result: 在ImageNet分类任务中比传统多模态RAG方法快3.5倍，在MSC基准测试中表现优于MemGPT。

Conclusion: AUGUSTUS通过图结构的多模态上下文记忆和语义标签的概念驱动检索，有效提升了多模态智能体系统的性能和效率，证明了多模态记忆系统的重要性。

Abstract: Riding on the success of LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
there has been a growing interest in augmenting agent systems with external
memory databases. However, the existing systems focus on storing text
information in their memory, ignoring the importance of multimodal signals.
Motivated by the multimodal nature of human memory, we present AUGUSTUS, a
multimodal agent system aligned with the ideas of human memory in cognitive
science. Technically, our system consists of 4 stages connected in a loop: (i)
encode: understanding the inputs; (ii) store in memory: saving important
information; (iii) retrieve: searching for relevant context from memory; and
(iv) act: perform the task. Unlike existing systems that use vector databases,
we propose conceptualizing information into semantic tags and associating the
tags with their context to store them in a graph-structured multimodal
contextual memory for efficient concept-driven retrieval. Our system
outperforms the traditional multimodal RAG approach while being 3.5 times
faster for ImageNet classification and outperforming MemGPT on the MSC
benchmark.

Abstract: Witnessed by the recent advancements on leveraging LLM for coding and
multimodal understanding, we present WebGen-V, a new benchmark and framework
for instruction-to-HTML generation that enhances both data quality and
evaluation granularity. WebGen-V contributes three key innovations: (1) an
unbounded and extensible agentic crawling framework that continuously collects
real-world webpages and can leveraged to augment existing benchmarks; (2) a
structured, section-wise data representation that integrates metadata,
localized UI screenshots, and JSON-formatted text and image assets, explicit
alignment between content, layout, and visual components for detailed
multimodal supervision; and (3) a section-level multimodal evaluation protocol
aligning text, layout, and visuals for high-granularity assessment. Experiments
with state-of-the-art LLMs and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of
our structured data and section-wise evaluation, as well as the contribution of
each component. To the best of our knowledge, WebGen-V is the first work to
enable high-granularity agentic crawling and evaluation for instruction-to-HTML
generation, providing a unified pipeline from real-world data acquisition and
webpage generation to structured multimodal assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态模型的数据增强方法存在视觉感知不足导致的事实错误和幻觉问题，需要更可靠的数据质量提升方案。

Method: 利用视觉识别模型和OCR提取结构化视觉先验，结合多个先进LMM评估原始答案，通过统计融合得到高置信度共识分数，训练轻量级批评模型，最终生成精炼答案。

Result: 在六个多模态基准测试中，使用VERITAS处理数据训练的模型性能优于使用原始数据的模型，尤其在文本丰富和细粒度推理任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: VERITAS能有效提升多模态数据质量，其批评模型在保持高效的同时具备与先进LMM相当的能力，为多模态数据优化研究提供了有价值工具。

Abstract: The quality of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data is crucial for the
performance of large multimodal models (LMMs), yet current data enhancement
methods often suffer from factual errors and hallucinations due to inadequate
visual perception. To address this challenge, we propose VERITAS, a pipeline
that systematically integrates vision priors and multiple state-of-the-art LMMs
with statistical methods to enhance SFT data quality. VERITAS leverages visual
recognition models (RAM++) and OCR systems (PP-OCRv4) to extract structured
vision priors, which are combined with images, questions, and answers. Three
LMMs (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Doubao-1.5-pro) evaluate the original answers,
providing critique rationales and scores that are statistically fused into a
high-confidence consensus score serving as ground truth. Using this consensus,
we train a lightweight critic model via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), enhancing reasoning capabilities efficiently. Each LMM then refines the
original answers based on the critiques, generating new candidate answers; we
select the highest-scoring one as the final refined answer. Experiments across
six multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that models fine-tuned with data
processed by VERITAS consistently outperform those using raw data, particularly
in text-rich and fine-grained reasoning tasks. Our critic model exhibits
enhanced capability comparable to state-of-the-art LMMs while being
significantly more efficient. We release our pipeline, datasets, and model
checkpoints to advance research in multimodal data optimization.

Motivation: 现有RL算法虽然提高了模型准确性，但会导致响应过长和过度思考问题，增加了推理延迟和计算消耗，特别是在简单任务中需要最小推理时。

Method: DEPO框架包含三个核心组件：(1) 优势解耦算法指导模型减少低效token；(2) 难度感知长度惩罚降低整体响应长度；(3) 优势裁剪方法防止策略优化偏差。

Result: 在DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-7B和1.5B模型上，DEPO实现了序列长度减少39%，减少了低效token中的过度推理路径，同时在整体准确性上优于基础模型。

Conclusion: DEPO有效解决了大型推理模型在简单任务中的低效推理问题，显著减少了响应长度和计算消耗，同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance in
solving complex problems via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
learning (RL). Although existing RL algorithms significantly enhance model
accuracy, they still suffer from excessively lengthy responses and overthinking
issues, resulting in increased inference latency and computational consumption,
especially for simple tasks that require minimal reasoning. To address this, we
propose a novel RL framework, DEPO, to reduce inefficient reasoning for models.
Our method mainly consists of three core components: (1) an innovative
advantage decoupled algorithm to guide model reduction of inefficient tokens;
(2) a difficulty-aware length penalty to lower the overall length of model
responses; (3) an advantage clipping method to prevent bias in policy
optimization. In our experiments, applied to DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-7B and
DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B as base models, DEPO achieves a significant
reduction in sequence length by 39% and reduces excessive reasoning paths in
inefficient tokens, while outperforming the base model in overall accuracy.

Abstract: The adoption of machine learning-based techniques for analog integrated
circuit layout, unlike its digital counterpart, has been limited by the
stringent requirements imposed by electric and problem-specific constraints,
along with the interdependence of floorplanning and routing steps. In this
work, we address a prevalent concern among layout engineers regarding the need
for readily available routing-aware floorplanning solutions. To this extent, we
develop an automatic floorplanning engine based on reinforcement learning and
relational graph convolutional neural network specifically tailored to
condition the floorplan generation towards more routable outcomes. A
combination of increased grid resolution and precise pin information
integration, along with a dynamic routing resource estimation technique, allows
balancing routing and area efficiency, eventually meeting industrial standards.
When analyzing the place and route effectiveness in a simulated environment,
the proposed approach achieves a 13.8% reduction in dead space, a 40.6%
reduction in wirelength and a 73.4% increase in routing success when compared
to past learning-based state-of-the-art techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在训练过程中不应抵抗目标更新，但部分学习的目标往往会激励AI避免进一步的目标更新。可修正性允许纠正错误和适应人类偏好变化，是重要的安全属性。

Method: 提供可修正性的正式定义，引入一种转换方法，通过短视地获取在无成本阻止更新条件下的奖励预测来构建任何可修正目标的修正版本。该方法可递归扩展到修正代理创建的新代理，并防止代理故意修改其目标。

Result: 两个网格世界实验表明，这些可修正目标可以被有效学习，并产生期望的行为。

Conclusion: 提出的转换方法能够构建既具有可修正性又与不可修正替代方案具有竞争力的目标，为AI安全提供了重要工具。

Abstract: For an AI's training process to successfully impart a desired goal, it is
important that the AI does not attempt to resist the training. However,
partially learned goals will often incentivize an AI to avoid further goal
updates, as most goals are better achieved by an AI continuing to pursue them.
We say that a goal is corrigible if it does not incentivize taking actions that
avoid proper goal updates or shutdown. In addition to convergence in training,
corrigibility also allows for correcting mistakes and changes in human
preferences, which makes it a crucial safety property. Despite this, the
existing literature does not include specifications for goals that are both
corrigible and competitive with non-corrigible alternatives. We provide a
formal definition for corrigibility, then introduce a transformation that
constructs a corrigible version of any goal that can be made corrigible,
without sacrificing performance. This is done by myopically eliciting
predictions of reward conditional on costlessly preventing updates, which then
also determine the reward when updates are accepted. The transformation can be
modified to recursively extend corrigibility to any new agents created by
corrigible agents, and to prevent agents from deliberately modifying their
goals. Two gridworld experiments demonstrate that these corrigible goals can be
learned effectively, and that they lead to the desired behavior.

Conclusion: 在策略游戏中通过自我博弈进行端到端强化学习是开发LLMs中可泛化多智能体推理能力的有效方法。

Abstract: Developing Large Language Models (LLMs) to cooperate and compete effectively
within multi-agent systems is a critical step towards more advanced
intelligence. While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for
enhancing reasoning in single-agent tasks, its extension to multi-turn,
multi-agent scenarios remains underexplored due to the challenges of
long-horizon credit assignment and agent-specific advantage estimation. To
address these challenges, we introduce MARS, an end-to-end RL framework that
incentivizes Multi-Agent Reasoning of LLMs through Self-play in both
cooperative and competitive games. MARS features a turn-level advantage
estimator that aligns learning signals with each interaction for credit
assignment, and an agent-specific advantage normalization to stabilize
multi-agent training. By learning with self-play across cooperative and
competitive games, the MARS agent trained from Qwen3-4B develops strong
strategic abilities that generalize to held-out games with up to 28.7%
performance improvements. More importantly, the capability acquired through
self-play generalizes beyond games, yielding consistent performance gains of
multi-agent systems in reasoning benchmarks. When integrated into leading
multi-agent systems, our MARS agent achieves significant performance gains of
10.0% on AIME and 12.5% on GPQA-Diamond. These results establish end-to-end RL
training with self-play in strategic games as a powerful approach for
developing generalizable multi-agent reasoning capabilities in LLMs. Our code

TL;DR: 提出了一个检测和解决强化学习中判断不一致性的框架，包含冲突检测率(CDR)指标和去冲突图奖励(DGR)方法，显著提升训练稳定性和模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法存在判断不一致性问题，特别是偏好循环等逻辑一致性问题未被充分解决，这会破坏强化学习的稳定性。

Method: 开发了CDR指标量化判断冲突，以及DGR框架：构建偏好图→转换为无冲突有向无环图→生成逻辑一致的奖励信号，兼容任何策略优化器。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架相比强基线显著提高了训练稳定性和模型性能。

Conclusion: 逻辑一致性是AI反馈中至关重要且现在可管理的维度，该框架成功解决了判断不一致性问题。

Abstract: However, this method often faces judgment inconsistencies that can
destabilize reinforcement learning. While prior research has focused on the
accuracy of judgments, the critical issue of logical coherence especially
issues such as preference cycles hasn't been fully addressed. To fill this gap,
we introduce a comprehensive framework designed to systematically detect and
resolve these inconsistencies during the reinforcement learning training
process. Our framework includes two main contributions: first, the Conflict
Detection Rate (CDR), a new metric that quantifies judgment conflicts, and
second, Deconflicted Graph Rewards (DGR), a framework that purifies signals by
removing cycles before policy optimization. DGR constructs preference graphs
from the initial judgments, transforms them into conflict-free Directed Acyclic
Graphs (DAGs), and generates a logically coherent reward signal that is
compatible with any policy optimizer. Experimental results show that our
framework significantly enhances training stability and model performance
compared to strong baselines, establishing logical consistency as a crucial and
now manageable dimension of AI feedback.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出MM-HCAN多模态超图对比注意力网络，用于电机故障诊断，在三个真实基准测试中达到99.82%准确率，具有强跨域泛化能力和抗噪性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以捕捉复杂多模态信号关系，局限于单模态数据或单一故障类型，且在噪声或跨域条件下性能下降。

Method: 在超图拓扑中集成对比学习，专门设计用于多模态传感器融合，联合建模模态内和模态间依赖关系，超越欧几里得嵌入空间。

Result: 在三个真实基准测试中达到99.82%准确率，具有强跨域泛化能力和抗噪性，消融研究验证了各组件贡献。

Conclusion: MM-HCAN为全面多故障诊断提供了可扩展的鲁棒解决方案，支持工业环境中的预测性维护和资产寿命延长。

Abstract: Reliable induction motor (IM) fault diagnosis is vital for industrial safety
and operational continuity, mitigating costly unplanned downtime. Conventional
approaches often struggle to capture complex multimodal signal relationships,
are constrained to unimodal data or single fault types, and exhibit performance
degradation under noisy or cross-domain conditions. This paper proposes the
Multimodal Hypergraph Contrastive Attention Network (MM-HCAN), a unified
framework for robust fault diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, MM-HCAN is
the first to integrate contrastive learning within a hypergraph topology
specifically designed for multimodal sensor fusion, enabling the joint
modelling of intra- and inter-modal dependencies and enhancing generalisation
beyond Euclidean embedding spaces. The model facilitates simultaneous diagnosis
of bearing, stator, and rotor faults, addressing the engineering need for
consolidated di- agnostic capabilities. Evaluated on three real-world
benchmarks, MM-HCAN achieves up to 99.82% accuracy with strong cross-domain
generalisation and resilience to noise, demonstrating its suitability for
real-world deployment. An ablation study validates the contribution of each
component. MM-HCAN provides a scalable and robust solution for comprehensive
multi-fault diagnosis, supporting predictive maintenance and extended asset
longevity in industrial environments.

*Jiayuan Bai,Xuan-guang Pan,Chongyang Tao,Shuai Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JudgeSQL是一个用于Text-to-SQL任务中候选查询选择的框架，通过结构化推理和加权共识锦标赛机制解决现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SQL候选选择方法（如自一致性和最佳N解码）仅提供浅层信号，容易产生不一致评分、脆弱推理链，并且无法捕捉密切相关的SQL候选项之间的细粒度语义差异。

Method: 开发基于推理的SQL评判模型，通过强化学习在可验证奖励指导下提炼推理轨迹；构建加权共识锦标赛机制，整合显式推理偏好和隐式生成器置信度。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试上的广泛实验表明，JudgeSQL展现出优越的SQL判断能力、良好的跨尺度泛化能力以及对生成器容量的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: JudgeSQL通过结构化推理和加权共识锦标赛重新定义了SQL候选选择，提供了更可靠和高效的查询选择方法。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL is a pivotal task that bridges natural language understanding and
structured data access, yet it remains fundamentally challenging due to
semantic ambiguity and complex compositional reasoning. While large language
models (LLMs) have greatly advanced SQL generation though prompting, supervised
finetuning and reinforced tuning, the shift toward test-time scaling exposes a
new bottleneck: selecting the correct query from a diverse candidate pool.
Existing selection approaches, such as self-consistency or best-of-$N$
decoding, provide only shallow signals, making them prone to inconsistent
scoring, fragile reasoning chains, and a failure to capture fine-grained
semantic distinctions between closely related SQL candidates. To this end, we
introduce JudgeSQL, a principled framework that redefines SQL candidate
selection through structured reasoning and weighted consensus tournament
mechanism. JudgeSQL develops a reasoning-based SQL judge model that distills
reasoning traces with reinforcement learning guided by verifiable rewards,
enabling accurate and interpretable judgments. Building on this, a weighted
consensus tournament integrates explicit reasoning preferences with implicit
generator confidence, yielding selections that are both more reliable and more
efficient. Extensive experiments on the BIRD benchmark demonstrate that
JudgeSQL exhibits superior SQL judgment capabilities and good cross-scale
generalization and robustness to generator capacity.

*Lavanya Umapathy,Patricia M Johnson,Tarun Dutt,Angela Tong,Madhur Nayan,Hersh Chandarana,Daniel K Sodickson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 开发了一个整合患者历史就诊信息的机器学习框架，通过利用时间上下文来改进前列腺癌风险预测，显著降低了假阳性率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学中的时间上下文对于评估患者健康状况随时间变化很有价值，特别是在既往就诊次数有限且频率不固定的情况下。

Method: 模型首先使用最近一次就诊的医疗数据估计初始疾病风险，然后利用先前收集的影像学和/或临床生物标志物信息来完善评估。

Result: 整合历史信息将假阳性转化为真阴性，总体特异性提高同时保持高敏感性。整合最多三次先前影像检查后，假阳性率从51%降至33%，加入临床数据后进一步降至24%。

Conclusion: 随时间收集的信息提供了相关上下文，可增强医学风险预测的特异性，为扩大纵向健康监测项目提供了途径，实现更早检测和改善健康结果。

Abstract: Temporal context in medicine is valuable in assessing key changes in patient
health over time. We developed a machine learning framework to integrate
diverse context from prior visits to improve health monitoring, especially when
prior visits are limited and their frequency is variable. Our model first
estimates initial risk of disease using medical data from the most recent
patient visit, then refines this assessment using information digested from
previously collected imaging and/or clinical biomarkers. We applied our
framework to prostate cancer (PCa) risk prediction using data from a large
population (28,342 patients, 39,013 magnetic resonance imaging scans, 68,931
blood tests) collected over nearly a decade. For predictions of the risk of
clinically significant PCa at the time of the visit, integrating prior context
directly converted false positives to true negatives, increasing overall
specificity while preserving high sensitivity. False positive rates were
reduced progressively from 51% to 33% when integrating information from up to
three prior imaging examinations, as compared to using data from a single
visit, and were further reduced to 24% when also including additional context
from prior clinical data. For predicting the risk of PCa within five years of
the visit, incorporating prior context reduced false positive rates still
further (64% to 9%). Our findings show that information collected over time
provides relevant context to enhance the specificity of medical risk
prediction. For a wide range of progressive conditions, sufficient reduction of
false positive rates using context could offer a pathway to expand longitudinal
health monitoring programs to large populations with comparatively low baseline
risk of disease, leading to earlier detection and improved health outcomes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出SciRecipe数据集和"Sketch-and-Fill"范式，开发Thoth模型用于生成可执行的科学协议，显著提升协议生成的完整性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型生成的科学协议往往不完整或不一致，限制了其在可重复科学研究中的实用性。

Method: 引入SciRecipe数据集（12K结构化协议），提出"Sketch-and-Fill"范式分离分析、结构化和表达，采用基于组件的奖励机制评估步骤粒度、行动顺序和语义保真度，通过分阶段的知识到行动过程训练Thoth模型。

Result: Thoth在多个基准测试中持续超越专有和开源LLM，在步骤对齐、逻辑排序和语义准确性方面实现显著改进。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建可靠的科学助手铺平了道路，能够有效连接知识与实验执行。

Abstract: The foundation of reproducible science lies in protocols that are precise,
logically ordered, and executable. The autonomous generation of these protocols
through natural language queries could greatly improve the efficiency of the
reproduction process. However, current leading large language models (LLMs)
often generate incomplete or inconsistent protocols, limiting their utility. To
address this limitation, we first introduce SciRecipe, a large-scale dataset of
over 12K structured protocols spanning 27 biological subfields and encompassing
both comprehension and problem-solving tasks. To further improve protocol
generation, we propose the "Sketch-and-Fill" paradigm, which separates
analysis, structuring, and expression to ensure each step is explicit and
verifiable. Complementing this, the structured component-based reward mechanism
evaluates step granularity, action order, and semantic fidelity, aligning model
optimization with experimental reliability. Building on these components, we
develop Thoth, trained through a staged Knowledge-to-Action process that
progresses from knowledge acquisition to operational reasoning and ultimately
to robust, executable protocol generation. Across multiple benchmarks, Thoth
consistently surpasses both proprietary and open-source LLMs, achieving
significant improvements in step alignment, logical sequencing, and semantic
accuracy. Our approach paves the way for reliable scientific assistants that
bridge knowledge with experimental execution. All data, code, and models will
be released publicly.

Abstract: The automation of scientific discovery represents a critical milestone in
Artificial Intelligence (AI) research. However, existing agentic systems for
science suffer from two fundamental limitations: rigid, pre-programmed
workflows that cannot adapt to intermediate findings, and inadequate context
management that hinders long-horizon research. We present
\texttt{freephdlabor}, an open-source multiagent framework featuring
\textit{fully dynamic workflows} determined by real-time agent reasoning and a
\coloremph{\textit{modular architecture}} enabling seamless customization --
users can modify, add, or remove agents to address domain-specific
requirements. The framework provides comprehensive infrastructure including
\textit{automatic context compaction}, \textit{workspace-based communication}
to prevent information degradation, \textit{memory persistence} across
sessions, and \textit{non-blocking human intervention} mechanisms. These
features collectively transform automated research from isolated, single-run
attempts into \textit{continual research programs} that build systematically on
prior explorations and incorporate human feedback. By providing both the
architectural principles and practical implementation for building customizable
co-scientist systems, this work aims to facilitate broader adoption of
automated research across scientific domains, enabling practitioners to deploy
interactive multiagent systems that autonomously conduct end-to-end research --
from ideation through experimentation to publication-ready manuscripts.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了改进RLHF的方法，通过使用三元或更多排序数据替代二元比较来解决用户偏好识别问题，并引入EM-DPO算法处理异质用户偏好，使用min-max遗憾公平准则聚合模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLHF和DPO方法假设统一的标注者偏好并依赖二元比较，忽视了人类评估者的多样性和成对反馈的局限性。

Method: 1) 连接偏好学习与计量经济学文献，证明三元或更多排序能确保偏好可识别性；2) 开发EM-DPO算法发现潜在标注者类型并训练混合LLM；3) 提出基于min-max遗憾公平准则的聚合算法。

Result: 建立了生成模型对齐中公平性和个性化的理论与算法框架，解决了多样用户偏好的识别和聚合问题。

Conclusion: 该工作为处理生成模型对齐中的用户多样性提供了理论基础和实用方法，通过排序数据和异质偏好建模实现了更公平的个性化对齐。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become central to
aligning large language models with human values, typically by first learning a
reward model from preference data which is then used to update the model with
reinforcement learning. Recent alternatives such as Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) simplify this pipeline by directly optimizing on
preferences. However, both approaches often assume uniform annotator
preferences and rely on binary comparisons, overlooking two key limitations:
the diversity of human evaluators and the limitations of pairwise feedback. In
this work, we address both these issues. First, we connect preference learning
in RLHF with the econometrics literature and show that binary comparisons are
insufficient for identifying latent user preferences from finite user data and
infinite users, while (even incomplete) rankings over three or more responses
ensure identifiability. Second, we introduce methods to incorporate
heterogeneous preferences into alignment algorithms. We develop an
Expectation-Maximization adaptation of DPO that discovers latent annotator
types and trains a mixture of LLMs accordingly. Then we propose an aggregation
algorithm using a min-max regret fairness criterion to produce a single
generative policy with equitable performance guarantees. Together, these
contributions establish a theoretical and algorithmic framework for fairness
and personalization for diverse users in generative model alignment.

Conclusion: 提出的评估指标为发票信息提取提供了标准化的性能评估方法，能够揭示不同字段提取的优缺点。

Abstract: This paper presents methods for extracting structured information from
invoice documents and proposes a set of evaluation metrics (EM) to assess the
accuracy of the extracted data against annotated ground truth. The approach
involves pre-processing scanned or digital invoices, applying Docling and
LlamaCloud Services to identify and extract key fields such as invoice number,
date, total amount, and vendor details. To ensure the reliability of the
extraction process, we establish a robust evaluation framework comprising
field-level precision, consistency check failures, and exact match accuracy.
The proposed metrics provide a standardized way to compare different extraction
methods and highlight strengths and weaknesses in field-specific performance.

Abstract: As autonomous agentic AI systems see increasing adoption across
organisations, persistent challenges in alignment, governance, and risk
management threaten to impede deployment at scale. We present AURA (Agent
aUtonomy Risk Assessment), a unified framework designed to detect, quantify,
and mitigate risks arising from agentic AI. Building on recent research and
practical deployments, AURA introduces a gamma-based risk scoring methodology
that balances risk assessment accuracy with computational efficiency and
practical considerations. AURA provides an interactive process to score,
evaluate and mitigate the risks of running one or multiple AI Agents,
synchronously or asynchronously (autonomously). The framework is engineered for
Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) oversight and presents Agent-to-Human (A2H)
communication mechanisms, allowing for seamless integration with agentic
systems for autonomous self-assessment, rendering it interoperable with
established protocols (MCP and A2A) and tools. AURA supports a responsible and
transparent adoption of agentic AI and provides robust risk detection and
mitigation while balancing computational resources, positioning it as a
critical enabler for large-scale, governable agentic AI in enterprise
environments.

TL;DR: 提出了首个将帕金森病评估中的多模态学习建模为多目标优化问题的系统TRIP，解决了传统多模态方法在训练时需要同步所有模态、推理时依赖所有模态的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态方法存在两个主要限制：(1)训练时需要同步所有模态数据，(2)推理时依赖所有模态数据，这阻碍了实际应用。

Method: 将多模态学习建模为多目标优化问题，引入基于边界的类别重平衡策略来处理模态内不平衡问题。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验表明，TRIP在异步设置下比最佳基线分别提升16.48、6.89和11.55个百分点，在同步设置下提升4.86和2.30个百分点。

Conclusion: TRIP框架在帕金森病评估中实现了最先进的性能，展示了其有效性和适应性。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease assessment has garnered growing interest in recent years,
particularly with the advent of sensor data and machine learning techniques.
Among these, multimodal approaches have demonstrated strong performance by
effectively integrating complementary information from various data sources.
However, two major limitations hinder their practical application: (1) the need
to synchronize all modalities during training, and (2) the dependence on all
modalities during inference. To address these issues, we propose the first
Parkinson's assessment system that formulates multimodal learning as a
multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. This not only allows for more
flexible modality requirements during both training and inference, but also
handles modality collapse issue during multimodal information fusion. In
addition, to mitigate the imbalance within individual modalities, we introduce
a margin-based class rebalancing strategy to enhance category learning. We
conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets under both synchronous
and asynchronous settings. The results show that our framework-Towards Relaxed
InPuts (TRIP)-achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the best
baselines by 16.48, 6.89, and 11.55 percentage points in the asynchronous
setting, and by 4.86 and 2.30 percentage points in the synchronous setting,
highlighting its effectiveness and adaptability.

investigates the relationship between explainability and user trust in AI
systems through a quantitative experimental design. Using an interactive,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在复杂多维度问题中缺乏通过经验发展专业知识的内生机制的问题，特别是在涉及非可验证结果、异质性影响和缺乏单一正确答案的'棘手问题'中。

Method: 开发Dialectica框架，让代理在定义的主题上进行结构化对话，结合记忆、自我反思和策略约束的上下文编辑，将讨论视为隐式元强化学习过程。

Result: 在两种模型架构上的评估显示，启用基于反思的上下文编辑的代理在Elo评分、标准化Bradley-Terry-Davidson能力和AlphaRank质量上均优于基线版本。

Conclusion: 对话驱动的上下文演化是在开放非可验证领域中实现针对性专业知识放大的实用路径。

Abstract: So-called `wicked problems', those involving complex multi-dimensional
settings, non-verifiable outcomes, heterogeneous impacts and a lack of single
objectively correct answers, have plagued humans throughout history. Modern
examples include decisions over justice frameworks, solving environmental
pollution, planning for pandemic resilience and food security. The use of
state-of-the-art artificial intelligence systems (notably Large Language
Model-based agents) collaborating with humans on solving such problems is being
actively explored. While the abilities of LLMs can be improved by, for example,
fine-tuning, hand-crafted system prompts and scaffolding with external tools,
LLMs lack endogenous mechanisms to develop expertise through experience in such
settings. This work address this gap with Dialectica, a framework where agents
engage in structured dialogue on defined topics, augmented by memory,
self-reflection, and policy-constrained context editing. Formally, discussion
is viewed as an implicit meta-reinforcement learning process. The
`dialogue-trained' agents are evaluated post-hoc using judged pairwise
comparisons of elicited responses. Across two model architectures (locally run
Qwen3:30b and OpenAI's o4-mini) results show that enabling reflection-based
context editing during discussion produces agents which dominate their baseline
counterparts on Elo scores, normalized Bradley-Terry-Davidson ability, and
AlphaRank mass. The predicted signatures of learning are observed qualitatively
in statement and reflection logs, where reflections identify weaknesses and
reliably shape subsequent statements. Agreement between quantitative and
qualitative evidence supports dialogue-driven context evolution as a practical
path to targeted expertise amplification in open non-verifiable domains.

Abstract: As AI chatbots gain adoption in clinical medicine, developing effective
frameworks for complex, emerging diseases presents significant challenges. We
developed and evaluated six Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) corpus
configurations for Long COVID (LC) clinical question answering, ranging from
expert-curated sources to large-scale literature databases. Our evaluation
employed an LLM-as-a-judge framework across faithfulness, relevance, and
comprehensiveness metrics using LongCOVID-CQ, a novel dataset of
expert-generated clinical questions. Our RAG corpus configuration combining
clinical guidelines with high-quality systematic reviews consistently
outperformed both narrow single-guideline approaches and large-scale literature
databases. Our findings suggest that for emerging diseases, retrieval grounded
in curated secondary reviews provides an optimal balance between narrow
consensus documents and unfiltered primary literature, supporting clinical
decision-making while avoiding information overload and oversimplified
guidance. We propose Guide-RAG, a chatbot system and accompanying evaluation
framework that integrates both curated expert knowledge and comprehensive
literature databases to effectively answer LC clinical questions.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用大语言模型自动生成代码片段对齐数据的数据增强方法，并采用两阶段训练策略提升代码翻译性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码翻译需要平行语料库，但现有的程序对齐数据可能缺乏细粒度训练信号，而片段对齐数据又有限。

Method: 使用LLM自动生成片段对齐数据，并设计两阶段训练策略结合程序对齐和片段对齐数据。

Result: 在TransCoder-test上的实验显示，该方法相比仅在程序对齐数据上微调的基线有显著提升，最大增益达3.78% on pass@k。

Conclusion: 通过数据增强和两阶段训练策略，可以有效提升代码翻译模型的性能。

Abstract: Code translation aims to translate the code from its source language to the
target language and is used in various software development scenarios. Recent
developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased their capabilities
in code translation, and parallel corpora play a crucial role in training
models for code translation. Parallel corpora can be categorized into
program-alignment (PA) and snippet-alignment (SA) data. Although PA data has
complete context and is suitable for semantic alignment learning, it may not
provide adequate fine-grained training signals due to its extended length,
while the brevity of SA data enables more fine-grained alignment learning. Due
to limited parallel corpora, researchers explore several augmentation methods
for code translation. Previous studies mainly focus on augmenting PA data. In
this paper, we propose a data augmentation method that leverages LLMs to
generate SA data automatically. To fully leverage both PA data and SA data, we
explore a simple yet effective two-stage training strategy, which consistently
enhances model performance compared to fine-tuning solely on PA data.
Experiments on TransCoder-test demonstrate that our augmented SA data combined
with the two-stage training approach yields consistent improvements over the
baseline, achieving a maximum gain of 3.78% on pass@k.

### [261] [Assessing Coherency and Consistency of Code Execution Reasoning by Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15079)
*Changshu Liu,Yang Chen,Reyhaneh Jabbarvand*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CES是一个评估LLM程序执行模拟能力的任务，引入连贯性概念来衡量模拟是否遵循常识执行逻辑，并提出了跨测试的推理一致性度量方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM在程序执行模拟和编程任务中的推理能力，排除因推理捷径、幻觉或数据泄露导致的虚假正确预测。

Method: 提出CES任务，通过测量变量预测正确性和执行模拟的连贯性，引入强、弱、随机三个级别的推理一致性度量。

Result: 在HumanEval上，LLM的81.42%执行模拟是连贯的，其中46.92%预测正确，53.08%预测错误。前沿LLM如GPT-4和DeepSeek-R1存在最多的不连贯执行推理。

Conclusion: LLM在编程任务中的成功主要源于模式匹配或自然语言捷径，而非执行推理。CES可用于系统性地验证LLM在这些任务中的可疑成功。

Abstract: This paper proposes CES, a task to evaluate the abilities of LLMs in
simulating program execution and using that reasoning in programming tasks.
Besides measuring the correctness of variable predictions during execution
simulation, CES introduces the notion of coherence to determine whether the
simulation complies with commonsense execution logic, even if the predicted
values along the simulations are incorrect. This enables CES to rule out
suspiciously correct output predictions due to reasoning shortcuts,
hallucinations, or potential data leakage. CES also introduces a novel metric
to measure reasoning consistency across tests with the same or different prime
path coverage in a spectrum: strong, weak, and random. Evaluating 16 LLMs
(including three reasoning LLMs) using CES indicates 81.42% coherent execution
simulation on HumanEval, 46.92% and 53.08% of which result in correct and
incorrect output predictions. Frontier LLMs such as GPT-4 and DeepSeek-R1 have
the most incoherent execution reasoning, mostly due to natural language
shortcuts. Despite relatively coherent execution simulation, LLMs' reasoning
performance across different tests is inconsistent, mostly random (48.87%) or
weak (45.37%), potentially explaining their weakness in programming tasks that
require path-sensitive program analysis to succeed. We also compare CES with
bug prediction/localization/repair, which intuitively requires control- and
data-flow awareness. We observe that LLMs barely incorporate execution
reasoning into their analysis for bug-related tasks, and their success is
primarily due to inherent abilities in pattern matching or natural language
shortcuts, if not data leakage. Without reasoning, there is a threat to the
generalizability of LLMs in dealing with unseen bugs or patterns in different
contexts. CES can be used to vet the suspicious success of LLMs in these tasks
systematically.

*Mohit,Kuljit Kaur Chahal*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该研究分析了开源软件项目中社区参与度对项目动态和寿命的影响，通过33,946个GitHub仓库数据发现社区参与度与项目活动显著相关，且初始参与度爆发和持续高参与度对项目寿命至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源软件项目依赖社区参与来维持长期发展，但社区参与对项目动态和寿命的可量化影响尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 分析了33,946个GitHub仓库，使用经过验证的月度指标（issues、comments、watchers、stargazers）来定义和操作化社区参与度，通过非参数测试和相关性分析评估其与项目动态和寿命的关系。

Result: 社区参与度指标与项目动态显著相关，在高度参与的项目中相关性更强。项目寿命方面呈现复杂模式：月度参与率在年轻项目中最高，随年龄下降，但部分长寿项目维持异常高活动。初始参与度爆发对项目建立至关重要，持续高参与度驱动极端长寿。

Conclusion: 社区参与度动态驱动开源软件项目的寿命和发展。研究建立了经过验证的社区参与度指标，并深入揭示了不同社区活动模式如何促进项目寿命。

Abstract: Open-source software (OSS) projects depend on community engagement (CE) for
longevity. However, CE's quantifiable impact on project dynamics and lifespan
is underexplored. Objectives: This study defines CE in OSS, identifies key
metrics, and evaluates their influence on project dynamics (releases, commits,
branches) and lifespan. Methods: We analyzed 33,946 GitHub repositories,
defining and operationalizing CE with validated per-month metrics (issues,
comments, watchers, stargazers). Non-parametric tests and correlations assessed
relationships with project dynamics and lifespan across quartiles. Results: CE
metrics significantly associate with project dynamics, with stronger
correlations in highly engaged projects. For lifespan, a complex pattern
emerged: per-month CE rates are highest in younger projects, declining with
age. Yet, a subset of long-lived projects maintains exceptionally high
activity. Initial CE bursts appear crucial for establishment, while sustained
high engagement drives extreme longevity. Active issue engagement's influence
intensifies with age, but passive attention's declines. Conclusion: CE
dynamically drives OSS project longevity and development. Our findings
establish validated CE metrics and offer deeper insights into how diverse
community activity patterns contribute to project longevity.

### [263] [Selecting and Combining Large Language Models for Scalable Code Clone Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15480)
*Muslim Chochlov,Gul Aftab Ahmed,James Vincent Patten,Yuanhua Han,Guoxian Lu,David Gregg,Jim Buckley*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该论文研究了使用大语言模型进行代码克隆检测，通过评估76个LLM筛选出适合大规模克隆检测的候选模型，并探索了LLM集成方法的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码克隆存在知识产权侵权和安全漏洞等风险，而现有的克隆检测方法在处理大规模和发散克隆时仍面临挑战。LLM在克隆检测任务中的应用引发了关于最优模型选择和集成方法有效性的问题。

Method: 识别并筛选76个LLM，在BigCloneBench和商业大规模数据集上评估候选模型性能。探索LLM集成方法，包括分数归一化和不同的集成策略（最大值、求和等）。

Result: 没有统一的'最佳LLM'，但CodeT5+110M、CuBERT和SPTCode表现最佳。在商业数据集上，CodeT5+110M达到39.71%的精确度，是之前CodeBERT的两倍。最佳集成方法在商业数据集上达到46.91%的精确度。

Conclusion: 较小的嵌入尺寸、较小的分词器词汇量和定制数据集有利于LLM克隆检测。集成方法通过分数归一化和选择合适策略可显著提升性能，在大规模数据集上效果更明显。

Abstract: Source code clones pose risks ranging from intellectual property violations
to unintended vulnerabilities. Effective and efficient scalable clone
detection, especially for diverged clones, remains challenging. Large language
models (LLMs) have recently been applied to clone detection tasks. However, the
rapid emergence of LLMs raises questions about optimal model selection and
potential LLM-ensemble efficacy.
  This paper addresses the first question by identifying 76 LLMs and filtering
them down to suitable candidates for large-scale clone detection. The
candidates were evaluated on two public industrial datasets, BigCloneBench, and
a commercial large-scale dataset. No uniformly 'best-LLM' emerged, though
CodeT5+110M, CuBERT and SPTCode were top-performers. Analysis of LLM-candidates
suggested that smaller embedding sizes, smaller tokenizer vocabularies and
tailored datasets are advantageous. On commercial large-scale dataset a
top-performing CodeT5+110M achieved 39.71\% precision: twice the precision of
previously used CodeBERT.
  To address the second question, this paper explores ensembling of the
selected LLMs: effort-effective approach to improving effectiveness. Results
suggest the importance of score normalization and favoring ensembling methods
like maximum or sum over averaging. Also, findings indicate that ensembling
approach can be statistically significant and effective on larger datasets: the
best-performing ensemble achieved even higher precision of 46.91\% over
individual LLM on the commercial large-scale code.

### [264] [An Experimental Study of Real-Life LLM-Proposed Performance Improvements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15494)
*Lirong Yi,Gregory Gay,Philipp Leitner*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LLMs能生成代码，但在生成高性能代码方面表现有限。虽然LLM生成的代码在大多数情况下比基线有所改进，但仍显著落后于人类开发者的优化方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs是否能够生成高性能代码，而不仅仅是功能正确的代码。通过真实世界的Java任务来评估LLMs在性能优化方面的能力。

Method: 使用从开源Java程序中挖掘的65个真实任务，其中开发者实现了显著加速。采用自动化流水线，使用两个领先的LLM在四种提示变体下生成补丁，并与基线和人工解决方案进行严格基准测试。

Result: LLM生成的代码在大多数情况下确实比基线性能有所提升，但人类开发者提出的补丁在统计上显著优于LLM修复方案。约三分之二的LLM解决方案在语义上与开发者优化想法相同或相似，其余三分之一提出了更原始的想法，但这些原始想法很少能带来实质性性能提升。

Conclusion: LLMs在生成性能优化代码方面仍有局限，虽然能产生改进，但往往无法找到真正最优的解决方案。LLMs在代码性能优化方面尚未达到人类专家的水平。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate code, but can they generate fast
code? In this paper, we study this question using a dataset of 65 real-world
tasks mined from open-source Java programs. We specifically select tasks where
developers achieved significant speedups, and employ an automated pipeline to
generate patches for these issues using two leading LLMs under four prompt
variations. By rigorously benchmarking the results against the baseline and
human-authored solutions, we demonstrate that LLM-generated code indeed
improves performance over the baseline in most cases. However, patches proposed
by human developers outperform LLM fixes by a statistically significant margin,
indicating that LLMs often fall short of finding truly optimal solutions. We
further find that LLM solutions are semantically identical or similar to the
developer optimization idea in approximately two-thirds of cases, whereas they
propose a more original idea in the remaining one-third. However, these
original ideas only occasionally yield substantial performance gains.

*Wachiraphan Charoenwet,Patanamon Thongtanunam,Van-Thuan Pham,Christoph Treude*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: FuzzSight是一个利用模糊测试和不变式分析来增强代码审查的框架，通过检测程序行为变化来识别潜在缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统代码审查主要依赖静态检查，难以发现程序动态行为问题。模糊测试能生成多样化输入但产生的丰富数据难以直接用于审查。

Method: 使用可能不变式表示程序行为，通过非崩溃模糊测试输入捕获运行时行为变化，比较不同版本间的行为差异。

Result: FuzzSight能标记75%的回归缺陷和80%的漏洞，比静态分析工具检测率提高10倍且误报更少。

Conclusion: FuzzSight展示了将模糊测试和不变式分析结合用于早期代码审查的潜力，连接了静态检查与动态行为洞察。

Abstract: Many software projects employ manual code review to gatekeep defects and
vulnerabilities in the code before integration. However, reviewers often work
under time pressure and rely primarily on static inspection, leaving the
dynamic aspects of the program unexplored. Dynamic analyses could reveal such
behaviors, but they are rarely integrated into reviews. Among them, fuzzing is
typically applied later to uncover crashing bugs. Yet its ability to exercise
code with diverse inputs makes it promising for exposing non-crashing, but
unexpected, behaviors earlier. Still, without suitable mechanisms to analyze
program behaviors, the rich data produced during fuzzing remains inaccessible
to reviewers, limiting its practical value in this context.
  We hypothesize that unexpected variations in program behaviors could signify
potential bugs. The impact of code changes can be automatically captured at
runtime. Representing program behavior as likely invariants, dynamic properties
consistently observed at specific program points, can provide practical signals
of behavioral changes. Such signals offer a way to distinguish between intended
changes and unexpected behavioral shifts from code changes.
  We present FuzzSight, a framework that leverages likely invariants from
non-crashing fuzzing inputs to highlight behavioral differences across program
versions. By surfacing such differences, it provides insights into which code
blocks may need closer attention. In our evaluation, FuzzSight flagged 75% of
regression bugs and up to 80% of vulnerabilities uncovered by 24-hour fuzzing.
It also outperformed SAST in identifying buggy code blocks, achieving ten times
higher detection rates with fewer false alarms. In summary, FuzzSight
demonstrates the potential and value of leveraging fuzzing and invariant
analysis for early-stage code review, bridging static inspection with dynamic
behavioral insights.

TL;DR: Colepp是一个开源跨平台工具，用于从多个可穿戴设备收集和同步生理数据（心率和运动信号），通过智能手机作为中心枢纽生成同步数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可穿戴设备广泛使用但缺乏高质量公共数据集，且数据收集条件难以控制，阻碍了稳健算法的发展。

Method: 开发了Colepp系统，集成智能手机作为中心枢纽，接收来自Polar H10胸带和Wear OS智能手表的数据，使用自定义同步协议和用户友好界面导出CSV格式的同步数据集。

Result: 该系统能够生成一致且同步的信号数据集，适用于人类活动识别和心率估计等应用。

Conclusion: Colepp工具有效解决了可穿戴设备数据收集的挑战，为研究社区提供了实用的数据收集解决方案。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of wearable devices such as smartwatches and fitness
trackers has fueled the demand for reliable physiological and movement data
collection tools. However, challenges such as limited access to large,
high-quality public datasets and a lack of control over data collection
conditions hinder the development of robust algorithms. This work presents
Colepp, an open-source, cross-platform tool designed to collect and synchronize
data from multiple wearable devices, including heart rate (via ECG and PPG) and
motion signals (accelerometer and gyroscope). The system integrates a
smartphone as a central hub, receiving data from a Polar H10 chest strap and a
Wear OS smartwatch, and exporting synchronized datasets in CSV format. Through
a custom synchronization protocol and user-friendly interface, Colepp
facilitates the generation of customizable, real-world datasets suitable for
applications such as human activity recognition and heart rate estimation. A
use case shows the effectiveness of the tool in producing consistent and
synchronized signals.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该立场论文提出将测试驱动开发(TDD)与大型语言模型(LLM)生成相结合的研究框架，以提高生成代码的正确性和可靠性，特别关注高风险领域的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在生成代码时经常出现幻觉、逻辑不一致和语法错误等问题，这在金融建模和科学计算等高风险领域尤为危险。需要一种方法来增强生成输出的准确性和可靠性。

Method: 提出"测试优先"的方法论，将TDD实践与LLM驱动生成相结合，通过技术约束和认知支架来引导LLM输出更准确、可验证和可理解的解决方案。

Result: 框架适用于多种编程环境，包括电子表格公式生成、Python脚本和Rust等强类型语言，并包含明确的实验设计、评估指标和TDD提示示例。

Conclusion: 通过强调测试驱动思维，旨在提高计算思维、提示工程技能和用户参与度，最终目标是在教育和专业开发实践中建立负责任和可靠的LLM集成。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are increasingly leveraged for
generating both traditional software code and spreadsheet logic. Despite their
impressive generative capabilities, these models frequently exhibit critical
issues such as hallucinations, subtle logical inconsistencies, and syntactic
errors, risks particularly acute in high stakes domains like financial
modelling and scientific computations, where accuracy and reliability are
paramount. This position paper proposes a structured research framework that
integrates the proven software engineering practice of Test-Driven Development
(TDD) with Large Language Model (LLM) driven generation to enhance the
correctness of, reliability of, and user confidence in generated outputs. We
hypothesise that a "test first" methodology provides both technical constraints
and cognitive scaffolding, guiding LLM outputs towards more accurate,
verifiable, and comprehensible solutions. Our framework, applicable across
diverse programming contexts, from spreadsheet formula generation to scripting
languages such as Python and strongly typed languages like Rust, includes an
explicitly outlined experimental design with clearly defined participant
groups, evaluation metrics, and illustrative TDD based prompting examples. By
emphasising test driven thinking, we aim to improve computational thinking,
prompt engineering skills, and user engagement, particularly benefiting
spreadsheet users who often lack formal programming training yet face serious
consequences from logical errors. We invite collaboration to refine and
empirically evaluate this approach, ultimately aiming to establish responsible
and reliable LLM integration in both educational and professional development
practices.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了React项目中性别多样性对软件开发的影响，发现女性在功能增强和依赖管理方面贡献显著，性别排斥对软件质量有害。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源软件设计中虽然提到女性存在，但很少关注性别多样性如何从根本上改变开发模式。本研究旨在了解性别包容对软件开发模式的潜在影响。

Method: 研究React这个广泛使用的JavaScript库，分析了11年间项目中的性别差异，考察了稳健性和创新性指标，以及主要版本发布前的贡献模式变化。

Result: 女性在功能增强和依赖管理方面贡献显著更多，排除女性对软件质量有害。

Conclusion: 增加性别多样性可以带来更包容、创新和稳健的软件。

Abstract: In open-source software design, the inclusion of women is often highlighted
simply to remind programmers that women exist. Yet, little attention is given
to how greater gender diversity, specifically women's participation, could
fundamentally alter development patterns. To understand the potential impact of
gender inclusion, this study investigates React, a widely used JavaScript
library for building user interfaces with an active contributor community. I
examine gender differences in metrics of robustness and innovation, as well as
shifts in contribution patterns leading up to major version releases over 11
years of the React project. My results show that the exclusion of women is
detrimental to software as women contribute significantly more to feature
enhancement and dependency management. By exploring how gender influences
innovation and robustness in the development of React, the study offers
critical insights into how increasing gender diversity could lead to more
inclusive, innovative, and robust software.

*Shiwen Ou,Yuwei Li,Lu Yu,Chengkun Wei,Tingke Wen,Qiangpu Chen,Yu Chen,Haizhi Tang,Zulie Pan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: MirrorFuzz是一个自动化API模糊测试解决方案，用于发现深度学习框架中的共享bug。它通过收集历史bug数据、匹配相似API以及利用LLM合成测试代码，在TensorFlow、PyTorch等框架中发现了315个bug，其中262个是新发现的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习框架中的bug会级联影响上层应用，但现有研究很少探索跨框架的API模式及其潜在风险。许多框架暴露相似的API，使它们容易受到共享bug的影响。

Method: MirrorFuzz采用三阶段方法：1) 收集每个API的历史bug数据识别潜在buggy API；2) 在框架内和跨框架匹配相似API；3) 使用LLM基于相似API的历史bug数据合成测试代码来触发类似bug。

Result: 在四个流行DL框架上的评估显示，MirrorFuzz在TensorFlow和PyTorch上的代码覆盖率分别比最先进方法提高了39.92%和98.20%。发现了315个bug，其中262个是新发现的，80个已修复，52个获得CNVD ID。

Conclusion: MirrorFuzz通过利用跨框架API相似性和历史bug数据，有效发现了深度学习框架中的共享bug，证明了其在提高代码覆盖率和bug检测能力方面的有效性。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) frameworks serve as the backbone for a wide range of
artificial intelligence applications. However, bugs within DL frameworks can
cascade into critical issues in higher-level applications, jeopardizing
reliability and security. While numerous techniques have been proposed to
detect bugs in DL frameworks, research exploring common API patterns across
frameworks and the potential risks they entail remains limited. Notably, many
DL frameworks expose similar APIs with overlapping input parameters and
functionalities, rendering them vulnerable to shared bugs, where a flaw in one
API may extend to analogous APIs in other frameworks. To address this
challenge, we propose MirrorFuzz, an automated API fuzzing solution to discover
shared bugs in DL frameworks. MirrorFuzz operates in three stages: First,
MirrorFuzz collects historical bug data for each API within a DL framework to
identify potentially buggy APIs. Second, it matches each buggy API in a
specific framework with similar APIs within and across other DL frameworks.
Third, it employs large language models (LLMs) to synthesize code for the API
under test, leveraging the historical bug data of similar APIs to trigger
analogous bugs across APIs. We implement MirrorFuzz and evaluate it on four
popular DL frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, OneFlow, and Jittor). Extensive
evaluation demonstrates that MirrorFuzz improves code coverage by 39.92\% and
98.20\% compared to state-of-the-art methods on TensorFlow and PyTorch,
respectively. Moreover, MirrorFuzz discovers 315 bugs, 262 of which are newly
found, and 80 bugs are fixed, with 52 of these bugs assigned CNVD IDs.

TL;DR: EASELAN是一个基于ELAN的多模态生物信号标注框架，旨在简化复杂数据集（特别是生物信号）的标注流程，支持从文件准备到后处理的完整工作流，并已成功应用于日常活动数据收集项目。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习和自适应认知系统的发展，对大规模、多模态、丰富标注数据的需求日益增长，特别是融合多种生物信号的模型需要更复杂的标注工具来应对数据复杂性。

Method: 在ELAN工具基础上构建，添加了专门组件来支持标注流程的所有阶段：简化标注文件准备、设置额外通道、集成GitHub版本控制、简化后处理，提供无缝工作流以整合生物信号。

Result: 成功应用于德国研究基金会资助的日常活动科学工程项目中的高维生物信号收集计划（餐桌布置活动），创建了完全标注的Table Setting Database。

Conclusion: EASELAN框架有效支持了生物信号收集、标注和处理研究，代码和标注数据库已公开，为相关研究提供了实用工具和资源。

Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning and adaptive cognitive systems are
driving a growing demand for large and richly annotated multimodal data. A
prominent example of this trend are fusion models, which increasingly
incorporate multiple biosignals in addition to traditional audiovisual
channels. This paper introduces the EASELAN annotation framework to improve
annotation workflows designed to address the resulting rising complexity of
multimodal and biosignals datasets. It builds on the robust ELAN tool by adding
new components tailored to support all stages of the annotation pipeline: From
streamlining the preparation of annotation files to setting up additional
channels, integrated version control with GitHub, and simplified
post-processing. EASELAN delivers a seamless workflow designed to integrate
biosignals and facilitate rich annotations to be readily exported for further
analyses and machine learning-supported model training. The EASELAN framework
is successfully applied to a high-dimensional biosignals collection initiative
on human everyday activities (here, table setting) for cognitive robots within
the DFG-funded Collaborative Research Center 1320 Everyday Activity Science and
Engineering (EASE). In this paper we discuss the opportunities, limitations,
and lessons learned when using EASELAN for this initiative. To foster research
on biosignal collection, annotation, and processing, the code of EASELAN is
publicly available(https://github.com/cognitive-systems-lab/easelan), along
with the EASELAN-supported fully annotated Table Setting Database.

TL;DR: 提出社区分析方法来追踪开源库在依赖生态系统中的实际使用情况，发现只有16%的API方法被实际使用，且仅74%的被使用API方法在测试套件中有覆盖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源软件维护者缺乏对其库在实际依赖项目中如何使用的持续反馈，这些洞察能帮助维护者改进测试策略、理解变更影响并更有效地指导库的演进。

Method: 对10个流行Java库及其各自50个依赖项目进行实证研究，使用社区分析方法分析库在依赖生态系统中的使用情况。

Result: 库开发者提供的API方法中平均只有16%被依赖生态系统实际使用，且仅74%的被使用API方法在库测试套件中有部分或完全覆盖。

Conclusion: 提出了两个指标帮助开发者根据社区使用的API评估测试套件，并通过调查验证了这些洞察在指导维护决策方面的实用价值。

Abstract: Open-source software (OSS) is a pillar of modern software development. Its
success depends on the dedication of maintainers who work constantly to keep
their libraries stable, adapt to changing needs, and support a growing
community. Yet, they receive little to no continuous feedback on how the
projects that rely on their libraries actually use their APIs. We believe that
gaining these insights can help maintainers make better decisions, such as
refining testing strategies, understanding the impact of changes, and guiding
the evolution of their libraries more effectively. We propose the use of
community-based analytics to analyze how an OSS library is used across its
dependent ecosystem. We conduct an empirical study of 10 popular Java libraries
and each with their respective dependent ecosystem of 50 projects. Our results
reveal that while library developers offer a wide range of API methods, only
16% on average are actively used by their dependent ecosystem. Moreover, only
74% of the used API methods are partially or fully covered by their library
test suite. We propose two metrics to help developers evaluate their test suite
according to the APIs used by their community, and we conduct a survey on
open-source practitioners to assess the practical value of these insights in
guiding maintenance decisions.

TL;DR: DMRetriever是首个专门为灾害管理设计的密集检索模型系列，通过三阶段训练框架实现SOTA性能，在参数效率方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用检索模型无法有效处理灾害管理场景中多样化的搜索意图，导致性能不稳定和不可靠，需要专门针对该领域的检索模型。

Method: 采用三阶段训练框架：双向注意力适应、无监督对比预训练、难度感知渐进指令微调，使用高质量数据精炼管道生成的数据进行训练。

Result: DMRetriever在所有六个搜索意图和每个模型规模上都实现了最先进的性能，参数效率极高，596M模型性能超过基线模型13.3倍，33M模型仅用基线7.6%的参数就超越基线。

Conclusion: DMRetriever是灾害管理领域首个专门的密集检索模型，通过创新的训练框架实现了卓越的性能和参数效率，为灾害管理信息检索提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Effective and efficient access to relevant information is essential for
disaster management. However, no retrieval model is specialized for disaster
management, and existing general-domain models fail to handle the varied search
intents inherent to disaster management scenarios, resulting in inconsistent
and unreliable performance. To this end, we introduce DMRetriever, the first
series of dense retrieval models (33M to 7.6B) tailored for this domain. It is
trained through a novel three-stage framework of bidirectional attention
adaptation, unsupervised contrastive pre-training, and difficulty-aware
progressive instruction fine-tuning, using high-quality data generated through
an advanced data refinement pipeline. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that DMRetriever achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across all six
search intents at every model scale. Moreover, DMRetriever is highly
parameter-efficient, with 596M model outperforming baselines over 13.3 X larger
and 33M model exceeding baselines with only 7.6% of their parameters. All

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐系统依赖手动特征工程和场景特定架构，阻碍跨场景迁移和大规模部署，需要统一的解决方案。

Method: 提出MTmixAtt架构，包含AutoToken模块自动聚类异构特征为语义连贯的token，以及MTmixAttBlock模块通过可学习混合矩阵、共享密集专家和场景感知稀疏专家实现高效token交互。

Conclusion: MTmixAtt为跨场景异构特征建模提供了统一且可扩展的解决方案，显著改善用户体验和商业成果。

Abstract: Industrial recommender systems critically depend on high-quality ranking
models. However, traditional pipelines still rely on manual feature engineering
and scenario-specific architectures, which hinder cross-scenario transfer and
large-scale deployment. To address these challenges, we propose
\textbf{MTmixAtt}, a unified Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with
Multi-Mix Attention, designed for large-scale recommendation tasks. MTmixAtt
integrates two key components. The \textbf{AutoToken} module automatically
clusters heterogeneous features into semantically coherent tokens, removing the
need for human-defined feature groups. The \textbf{MTmixAttBlock} module
enables efficient token interaction via a learnable mixing matrix, shared dense
experts, and scenario-aware sparse experts, capturing both global patterns and
scenario-specific behaviors within a single framework. Extensive experiments on
the industrial TRec dataset from Meituan demonstrate that MTmixAtt consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines including Transformer-based models,
WuKong, HiFormer, MLP-Mixer, and RankMixer. At comparable parameter scales,
MTmixAtt achieves superior CTR and CTCVR metrics; scaling to MTmixAtt-1B yields
further monotonic gains. Large-scale online A/B tests validate the real-world
impact: in the \textit{Homepage} scenario, MTmixAtt increases Payment PV by
\textbf{+3.62\%} and Actual Payment GTV by \textbf{+2.54\%}. Overall, MTmixAtt
provides a unified and scalable solution for modeling arbitrary heterogeneous
features across scenarios, significantly improving both user experience and
commercial outcomes.

*Yijia Sun,Shanshan Huang,Zhiyuan Guan,Qiang Luo,Ruiming Tang,Kun Gai,Guorui Zhou*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: GRank是一个新颖的无结构化索引检索范式，将目标感知学习与用户中心检索无缝统一，通过生成器进行个性化候选生成和轻量级排序器进行细粒度推理，在召回率和延迟方面显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推荐系统检索阶段存在两个主要问题：(1) 双塔架构表达能力有限，无法捕捉细粒度用户-物品交互，生成模型缺乏精确的目标感知匹配能力；(2) 结构化索引方法难以融入动态用户偏好，且构建和维护成本高昂。

Method: 提出GRank框架，包含三个关键创新：(1) 目标感知生成器，通过GPU加速的MIPS进行个性化候选生成；(2) 轻量级但强大的排序器，在小子集上执行细粒度、候选特定的推理；(3) 端到端多任务学习框架，确保生成和排序目标的语义一致性。

Result: 在两个公共基准测试和十亿级生产语料上的实验表明，GRank将Recall@500提高了30%以上，P99 QPS达到基于树和图的最先进检索器的1.7倍。已在生产环境中部署，服务4亿活跃用户，在线A/B测试显示核心参与度指标显著提升。

Conclusion: GRank成功解决了工业级推荐系统检索阶段的挑战，通过消除结构化索引实现了高效、高精度的检索，在实际生产环境中验证了其有效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Industrial-scale recommender systems rely on a cascade pipeline in which the
retrieval stage must return a high-recall candidate set from billions of items
under tight latency. Existing solutions ei- ther (i) suffer from limited
expressiveness in capturing fine-grained user-item interactions, as seen in
decoupled dual-tower architectures that rely on separate encoders, or
generative models that lack precise target-aware matching capabilities, or (ii)
build structured indices (tree, graph, quantization) whose item-centric
topologies struggle to incorporate dynamic user preferences and incur
prohibitive construction and maintenance costs.
  We present GRank, a novel structured-index-free retrieval paradigm that
seamlessly unifies target-aware learning with user-centric retrieval. Our key
innovations include: (1) A target-aware Generator trained to perform
personalized candidate generation via GPU-accelerated MIPS, eliminating
semantic drift and maintenance costs of structured indexing; (2) A lightweight
but powerful Ranker that performs fine-grained, candidate-specific inference on
small subsets; (3) An end-to-end multi-task learning framework that ensures
semantic consistency between generation and ranking objectives.
  Extensive experiments on two public benchmarks and a billion-item production
corpus demonstrate that GRank improves Recall@500 by over 30% and 1.7$\times$
the P99 QPS of state-of-the-art tree- and graph-based retrievers.
  GRank has been fully deployed in production in our recommendation platform
since Q2 2025, serving 400 million active users with 99.95% service
availability. Online A/B tests confirm significant improvements in core
engagement metrics, with Total App Usage Time increasing by 0.160% in the main
app and 0.165% in the Lite version.

*Srijan Saket,Ikuhiro Ihara,Vaibhav Sharma,Danish Kalim*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出一种自动确定ID特征最佳嵌入尺寸的方法，通过维度掩码层将嵌入向量维度减少40-50%，显著降低模型内存占用且保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代推荐系统和社交媒体平台中的大规模ID特征需要大量内存的嵌入表，导致模型庞大难以部署和维护。

Method: 设计自定义Keras维度掩码层，放置在嵌入查找层之后，仅允许前N个维度通过，从而修剪嵌入向量。

Result: 在公共数据集和生产环境A/B测试中，有效嵌入维度减少40-50%，内存效率显著提升，模型性能指标基本无损失。

Conclusion: 该方法为处理大量ID特征的平台提供了可扩展解决方案，优化了资源使用和模型性能。

Abstract: In modern recommendation systems and social media platforms like Meta,
TikTok, and Instagram, large-scale ID-based features often require embedding
tables that consume significant memory. Managing these embedding sizes can be
challenging, leading to bulky models that are harder to deploy and maintain. In
this paper, we introduce a method to automatically determine the optimal
embedding size for ID features, significantly reducing the model size while
maintaining performance.
  Our approach involves defining a custom Keras layer called the dimension mask
layer, which sits directly after the embedding lookup. This layer trims the
embedding vector by allowing only the first N dimensions to pass through. By
doing this, we can reduce the input feature dimension by more than half with
minimal or no loss in model performance metrics. This reduction helps cut down
the memory footprint of the model and lowers the risk of overfitting due to
multicollinearity.
  Through offline experiments on public datasets and an online A/B test on a
real production dataset, we demonstrate that using a dimension mask layer can
shrink the effective embedding dimension by 40-50\%, leading to substantial
improvements in memory efficiency. This method provides a scalable solution for
platforms dealing with a high volume of ID features, optimizing both resource
usage and model performance.

*Sho Okazaki,Kohei Kaminishi,Takuma Fujiu,Yusheng Wang,Jun Ota*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合制造领域概念化和图神经网络推理的过程感知框架，通过本体引导的LLM提取将FMEA工作表转换为统一知识图谱，使用RGCN学习嵌入，并通过链接预测推断故障原因，显著提高了FMEA知识在异构生产线间的可重用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化制造生产线故障原因识别面临系统复杂性、频繁重新配置以及现有FMEA知识可重用性有限等挑战。虽然FMEA工作表包含有价值的专家见解，但由于自然语言变异性、术语不一致和流程差异，其在异构生产线间的重用受到阻碍。

Method: 1) 通过本体引导的LLM提取将多个制造生产线的FMEA工作表转换为统一知识图谱；2) 使用具有过程感知评分函数的RGCN学习既尊重语义关系又考虑顺序流程的嵌入；3) 采用链接预测来推断和排序与目标生产线流程一致的候选故障原因。

Result: 在汽车压力传感器装配生产线的案例研究中，该方法优于最先进的检索增强生成基线(F1@20=0.267)和RGCN方法(0.400)，在故障原因识别方面取得了最佳性能(0.523)。消融研究证实了LLM驱动的领域概念化和过程感知学习的贡献。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提高了FMEA知识在异构生产线间的可转移性，从而支持操作员更可靠地诊断故障，并为智能制造中未来领域自适应LLM应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Fault cause identification in automated manufacturing lines is challenging
due to the system's complexity, frequent reconfigurations, and the limited
reusability of existing Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) knowledge.
Although FMEA worksheets contain valuable expert insights, their reuse across
heterogeneous lines is hindered by natural language variability, inconsistent
terminology, and process differences. To address these limitations, this study
proposes a process-aware framework that enhances FMEA reusability by combining
manufacturing-domain conceptualization with graph neural network (GNN)
reasoning. First, FMEA worksheets from multiple manufacturing lines are
transformed into a unified knowledge graph through ontology-guided large
language model (LLM) extraction, capturing domain concepts such as actions,
states, components, and parameters. Second, a Relational Graph Convolutional
Network (RGCN) with the process-aware scoring function learns embeddings that
respect both semantic relationships and sequential process flows. Finally, link
prediction is employed to infer and rank candidate fault causes consistent with
the target line's process flow.
  A case study on automotive pressure sensor assembly lines demonstrates that
the proposed method outperforms a state-of-the-art retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) baseline (F1@20 = 0.267) and an RGCN approach (0.400),
achieving the best performance (0.523) in fault cause identification. Ablation
studies confirm the contributions of both LLM-driven domain conceptualization
and process-aware learning. These results indicate that the proposed framework
significantly improves the transferability of FMEA knowledge across
heterogeneous lines, thereby supporting operators in diagnosing failures more
reliably and paving the way for future domain-adaptive LLM applications in
smart manufacturing.

*Zhisheng Yang,Xiaofei Xu,Ke Deng,Li Li*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出Critic-LLM-RS方法，通过训练独立的协同过滤模型Critic为LLMs提供反馈，在不微调LLMs的情况下提升推荐质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有非微调策略的LLM推荐方法缺乏任务特定的业务知识，且未集成协同过滤这一成功推荐技术，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 训练独立的协同过滤模型Critic，学习用户-物品交互，为LLMs提供反馈来优化推荐结果。

Result: 在真实数据集上的大量实验验证了Critic-LLM-RS的有效性。

Conclusion: Critic-LLM-RS成功将协同过滤集成到非微调的LLM推荐系统中，显著提升了推荐质量。

Abstract: As powerful tools in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models
(LLMs) have been leveraged for crafting recommendations to achieve precise
alignment with user preferences and elevate the quality of the recommendations.
The existing approaches implement both non-tuning and tuning strategies.
Compared to following the tuning strategy, the approaches following the
non-tuning strategy avoid the relatively costly, time-consuming, and
expertise-requiring process of further training pre-trained LLMs on
task-specific datasets, but they suffer the issue of not having the
task-specific business or local enterprise knowledge. To the best of our
knowledge, none of the existing approaches following the non-tuning strategy
explicitly integrates collaborative filtering, one of the most successful
recommendation techniques. This study aims to fill the gap by proposing
critique-based LLMs as recommendation systems (Critic-LLM-RS). For our purpose,
we train a separate machine-learning model called Critic that implements
collaborative filtering for recommendations by learning from the interactions
between many users and items. The Critic provides critiques to LLMs to
significantly refine the recommendations. Extensive experiments have verified
the effectiveness of Critic-LLM-RS on real datasets.

Conclusion: SQuAI通过透明推理、可验证引用和领域级可扩展性，展示了多智能体RAG如何实现更可信的科学问答。

Abstract: We present SQuAI (https://squai.scads.ai/), a scalable and trustworthy
multi-agent retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework for scientific
question answering (QA) with large language models (LLMs). SQuAI addresses key
limitations of existing RAG systems in the scholarly domain, where complex,
open-domain questions demand accurate answers, explicit claims with citations,
and retrieval across millions of scientific documents. Built on over 2.3
million full-text papers from arXiv.org, SQuAI employs four collaborative
agents to decompose complex questions into sub-questions, retrieve targeted
evidence via hybrid sparse-dense retrieval, and adaptively filter documents to
improve contextual relevance. To ensure faithfulness and traceability, SQuAI
integrates in-line citations for each generated claim and provides supporting
sentences from the source documents. Our system improves faithfulness, answer
relevance, and contextual relevance by up to +0.088 (12%) over a strong RAG
baseline. We further release a benchmark of 1,000 scientific
question-answer-evidence triplets to support reproducibility. With transparent
reasoning, verifiable citations, and domain-wide scalability, SQuAI
demonstrates how multi-agent RAG enables more trustworthy scientific QA with
LLMs.

Motivation: 解决密集检索模型在特定任务和领域训练后泛化能力不足的问题，同时避免传统MoE方法带来的大量额外参数开销。

Method: 在最终Transformer层后引入单一MoE块，使用两种评估设置：在七个IR基准上进行领域内评估，以及在MSMARCO上微调后在十三个BEIR数据集上进行零样本评估。

Result: SB-MoE对轻量级基础模型（如TinyBERT和BERT-Small）特别有效，在基准测试中持续超越标准微调。对于参数更多的模型，需要更多训练样本才能获得改进的检索性能。

Conclusion: SB-MoE是一种高效的MoE设计，能够有效提升密集检索模型的性能，特别是对轻量级模型效果显著，同时保持了参数效率。

Abstract: Dense Retrieval Models (DRMs) are a prominent development in Information
Retrieval (IR). A key challenge with these neural Transformer-based models is
that they often struggle to generalize beyond the specific tasks and domains
they were trained on. To address this challenge, prior research in IR
incorporated the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework within each Transformer
layer of a DRM, which, though effective, substantially increased the number of
additional parameters. In this paper, we propose a more efficient design, which
introduces a single MoE block (SB-MoE) after the final Transformer layer. To
assess the retrieval effectiveness of SB-MoE, we perform an empirical
evaluation across three IR tasks. Our experiments involve two evaluation
setups, aiming to assess both in-domain effectiveness and the model's zero-shot
generalizability. In the first setup, we fine-tune SB-MoE with four different
underlying DRMs on seven IR benchmarks and evaluate them on their respective
test sets. In the second setup, we fine-tune SB-MoE on MSMARCO and perform
zero-shot evaluation on thirteen BEIR datasets. Additionally, we perform
further experiments to analyze the model's dependency on its hyperparameters
(i.e., the number of employed and activated experts) and investigate how this
variation affects SB-MoE's performance. The obtained results show that SB-MoE
is particularly effective for DRMs with lightweight base models, such as
TinyBERT and BERT-Small, consistently exceeding standard model fine-tuning
across benchmarks. For DRMs with more parameters, such as BERT-Base and
Contriever, our model requires a larger number of training samples to achieve
improved retrieval performance. Our code is available online at:

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong reasoning and text generation
capabilities, prompting their use in scientific literature analysis, including
novelty assessment. While evaluating novelty of scientific papers is crucial
for peer review, it requires extensive knowledge of related work, something not
all reviewers have. While recent work on LLM-assisted scientific literature
analysis supports literature comparison, existing approaches offer limited
transparency and lack mechanisms for result traceability via an information
retrieval module. To address this gap, we introduce $\textbf{GraphMind}$, an
easy-to-use interactive web tool designed to assist users in evaluating the
novelty of scientific papers or drafted ideas. Specially, $\textbf{GraphMind}$
enables users to capture the main structure of a scientific paper, explore
related ideas through various perspectives, and assess novelty via providing
verifiable contextual insights. $\textbf{GraphMind}$ enables users to annotate
key elements of a paper, explore related papers through various relationships,
and assess novelty with contextual insight. This tool integrates external APIs
such as arXiv and Semantic Scholar with LLMs to support annotation, extraction,
retrieval and classification of papers. This combination provides users with a
rich, structured view of a scientific idea's core contributions and its
connections to existing work. $\textbf{GraphMind}$ is available at

TL;DR: FACE框架通过将协同过滤嵌入映射到预训练LLM的token中，解决了LLM难以解释CF非语义嵌入的问题，提升推荐效果和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型难以解释协同过滤方法产生的潜在非语义嵌入，这限制了推荐系统的效果和进一步应用。

Method: 提出FACE框架：使用解耦投影模块分解CF嵌入为概念特定向量，通过量化自编码器将连续嵌入转换为LLM token，并设计对比对齐目标确保token与文本信号对齐。

Result: 在三个真实世界推荐数据集上的实证结果显示基准模型性能提升，可解释性研究证实了描述符的可解释性。

Conclusion: 模型无关的FACE框架无需微调LLM即可实现语义对齐，通过利用预训练能力增强推荐性能。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been explored for integration
with collaborative filtering (CF)-based recommendation systems, which are
crucial for personalizing user experiences. However, a key challenge is that
LLMs struggle to interpret the latent, non-semantic embeddings produced by CF
approaches, limiting recommendation effectiveness and further applications. To
address this, we propose FACE, a general interpretable framework that maps CF
embeddings into pre-trained LLM tokens. Specifically, we introduce a
disentangled projection module to decompose CF embeddings into concept-specific
vectors, followed by a quantized autoencoder to convert continuous embeddings
into LLM tokens (descriptors). Then, we design a contrastive alignment
objective to ensure that the tokens align with corresponding textual signals.
Hence, the model-agnostic FACE framework achieves semantic alignment without
fine-tuning LLMs and enhances recommendation performance by leveraging their
pre-trained capabilities. Empirical results on three real-world recommendation
datasets demonstrate performance improvements in benchmark models, with
interpretability studies confirming the interpretability of the descriptors.

TL;DR: 提出FIRE框架，将证据检索和声明验证迭代整合，通过统一机制决定是否给出最终答案或生成后续搜索查询，在略微提升性能的同时显著降低LLM和搜索成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统事实核查方法对原子声明进行固定数量证据检索和验证，成本效益低，未能充分利用验证模型内部知识，也无法复现人类迭代推理的搜索策略。

Method: FIRE采用基于智能体的框架，将证据检索和声明验证迭代整合，通过统一机制基于当前判断的置信度来决定提供最终答案或生成后续搜索查询。

Result: 与其他强事实核查框架相比，FIRE在略微提升性能的同时，平均降低LLM成本7.6倍，搜索成本16.5倍。

Conclusion: FIRE在大规模事实核查应用中具有良好前景，代码已开源。

Abstract: Fact-checking long-form text is challenging, and it is therefore common
practice to break it down into multiple atomic claims. The typical approach to
fact-checking these atomic claims involves retrieving a fixed number of pieces
of evidence, followed by a verification step. However, this method is usually
not cost-effective, as it underutilizes the verification model's internal
knowledge of the claim and fails to replicate the iterative reasoning process
in human search strategies. To address these limitations, we propose FIRE, a
novel agent-based framework that integrates evidence retrieval and claim
verification in an iterative manner. Specifically, FIRE employs a unified
mechanism to decide whether to provide a final answer or generate a subsequent
search query, based on its confidence in the current judgment. We compare FIRE
with other strong fact-checking frameworks and find that it achieves slightly
better performance while reducing large language model (LLM) costs by an
average of 7.6 times and search costs by 16.5 times. These results indicate
that FIRE holds promise for application in large-scale fact-checking
operations. Our code is available at https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/fire.git.

Abstract: Contract theory studies how a principal can incentivize agents to exert
costly, unobservable effort through performance-based payments. While classical
economic models provide elegant characterizations of optimal solutions, modern
applications, ranging from online labor markets and healthcare to AI delegation
and blockchain protocols, call for an algorithmic perspective. The challenge is
no longer only which contracts induce desired behavior, but whether such
contracts can be computed efficiently. This viewpoint has given rise to
\emph{algorithmic contract design}, paralleling the rise of algorithmic
mechanism design two decades ago.
  This article focuses on \emph{combinatorial contracts}, an emerging frontier
within algorithmic contract design, where agents may choose among exponentially
many combinations of actions, or where multiple agents must work together as a
team, and the challenge lies in selecting the right composition. These models
capture a wide variety of real-world contracting environments, from hospitals
coordinating physicians across treatment protocols to firms hiring teams of
engineers for interdependent tasks. We review three combinatorial settings: (i)
a single agent choosing multiple actions, (ii) multiple agents with binary
actions, and (iii) multiple agents each selecting multiple actions. For each,
we highlight structural insights, algorithmic techniques, and complexity
barriers. Results include tractable cases such as gross substitutes reward
functions, hardness results, and approximation guarantees under value- and
demand-oracle access. By charting these advances, the article maps the emerging
landscape of combinatorial contract design, and highlights fundamental open
questions and promising directions for future work.

Conclusion: 该研究为手牌抽象提供了统一的形式化处理，并为设计更高分辨率的不完全信息游戏抽象提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Hand abstraction is crucial for scaling imperfect-information games (IIGs)
such as Texas Hold'em, yet progress is limited by the lack of a formal task
model and by evaluations that require resource-intensive strategy solving. We
introduce signal observation ordered games (SOOGs), a subclass of IIGs tailored
to hold'em-style games that cleanly separates signal from player action
sequences, providing a precise mathematical foundation for hand abstraction.
Within this framework, we define a resolution bound-an information-theoretic
upper bound on achievable performance under a given signal abstraction. Using
the bound, we show that mainstream outcome-based imperfect-recall algorithms
suffer substantial losses by arbitrarily discarding historical information; we
formalize this behavior via potential-aware outcome Isomorphism (PAOI) and
prove that PAOI characterizes their resolution bound. To overcome this
limitation, we propose full-recall outcome isomorphism (FROI), which integrates
historical information to raise the bound and improve policy quality.
Experiments on hold'em-style benchmarks confirm that FROI consistently
outperforms outcome-based imperfect-recall baselines. Our results provide a
unified formal treatment of hand abstraction and practical guidance for
designing higher-resolution abstractions in IIGs.

Abstract: Motivated by the problem of selling large, proprietary data, we consider an
information pricing problem proposed by Bergemann et al. that involves a
decision-making buyer and a monopolistic seller. The seller has access to the
underlying state of the world that determines the utility of the various
actions the buyer may take. Since the buyer gains greater utility through
better decisions resulting from more accurate assessments of the state, the
seller can therefore promise the buyer supplemental information at a price. To
contend with the fact that the seller may not be perfectly informed about the
buyer's private preferences (or utility), we frame the problem of designing a
data product as one where the seller designs a revenue-maximizing menu of
statistical experiments.
  Prior work by Cai et al. showed that an optimal menu can be found in time
polynomial in the state space, whereas we observe that the state space is
naturally exponential in the dimension of the data. We propose an algorithm
which, given only sampling access to the state space, provably generates a
near-optimal menu with a number of samples independent of the state space. We
then analyze a special case of high-dimensional Gaussian data, showing that (a)
it suffices to consider scalar Gaussian experiments, (b) the optimal menu of
such experiments can be found efficiently via a semidefinite program, and (c)
full surplus extraction occurs if and only if a natural separation condition
holds on the set of potential preferences of the buyer.

Abstract: The E-commerce advertising platforms typically sell commercial traffic
through either second-price auction (SPA) or first-price auction (FPA). SPA was
historically prevalent due to its dominant strategy incentive-compatible (DSIC)
for bidders with quasi-linear utilities, especially when budgets are not a
binding constraint, while FPA has gained more prominence for offering higher
revenue potential to publishers and avoiding the possibility for discriminatory
treatment in personalized reserve prices. Meanwhile, on the demand side,
advertisers are increasingly adopting platform-wide marketing solutions akin to
QuanZhanTui, shifting from spending budgets solely on commercial traffic to
bidding on the entire traffic for the purpose of maximizing overall sales. For
automated bidding systems, such a trend poses a critical challenge: determining
optimal strategies across heterogeneous auction channels to fulfill diverse
advertiser objectives, such as maximizing return (MaxReturn) or meeting target
return on ad spend (TargetROAS). To overcome this challenge, this work makes
two key contributions. First, we derive an efficient solution for optimal
bidding under FPA channels, which takes into account the presence of organic
traffic - traffic can be won for free. Second, we introduce a marginal cost
alignment (MCA) strategy that provably secures bidding efficiency across
heterogeneous auction mechanisms. To validate performance of our developed
framework, we conduct comprehensive offline experiments on public datasets and
large-scale online A/B testing, which demonstrate consistent improvements over
existing methods.

*Xavier Tan,Xiaoli Tang,Han Yu*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 提出了一种可重新协商的合同理论激励机制（RC-TIM），用于联邦学习，通过支持合同重新协商来适应数据所有者行为变化和预算约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习激励机制假设合同一旦签订就保持不变，但不可预见的情况可能导致数据所有者无法履行合同，造成预算利用效率低下。

Method: 设计可重新协商的合同理论激励机制，允许根据数据所有者行为变化和预算约束动态调整合同条款。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，RC-TIM显著优于四种最先进方法，平均效用提升达45.76%。

Conclusion: RC-TIM使联邦学习系统更能适应运营环境中的不可预测变化，提高了激励机制的有效性和灵活性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has gained prominence due to heightened concerns over
data privacy. Privacy restrictions limit the visibility for data consumers
(DCs) to accurately assess the capabilities and efforts of data owners (DOs).
Thus, for open collaborative FL markets to thrive, effective incentive
mechanisms are key as they can motivate data owners (DOs) to contribute to FL
tasks. Contract theory is a useful technique for developing FL incentive
mechanisms. Existing approaches generally assume that once the contract between
a DC and a DO is signed, it remains unchanged until the FL task is finished.
However, unforeseen circumstances might force a DO to be unable to fulfill the
current contract, resulting in inefficient utilization of DCs' budgets. To
address this limitation, we propose the Renegotiable Contract-Theoretic
Incentive Mechanism (RC-TIM) for FL. Unlike previous approaches, it adapts to
changes in DOs' behavior and budget constraints by supporting the renegotiation
of contracts, providing flexible and dynamic incentives. Under RC-TIM, an FL
system is more adaptive to unpredictable changes in the operating environment
that can affect the quality of the service provided by DOs. Extensive
experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that RC-TIM significantly
outperforms four state-of-the-art related methods, delivering up to a 45.76%
increase in utility on average.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于联盟博弈理论的动态共同投资方案，允许基础设施提供商和服务提供商在移动边缘计算基础设施中灵活加入、停留或退出，通过计算入场费和退出惩罚来补偿留在联盟中的参与者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动边缘计算基础设施部署需要大量投资，基础设施提供商可能不愿独自承担。共同投资可以分担成本和收入，但长期承诺可能限制参与者的灵活性，因为未来可能出现更高的机会成本。

Method: 基于联盟博弈理论设计动态方案，允许参与者动态加入、停留或退出共同投资，调整基础设施容量和资源共享，计算入场费和退出惩罚来补偿留在联盟中的参与者。

Result: 数值模拟显示，该动态方案鼓励参与者参与，并在机会成本较高时增加利润。

Conclusion: 动态共同投资方案能够有效解决移动边缘计算基础设施投资问题，通过灵活的参与机制和补偿机制提高参与者利润和参与意愿。

Abstract: Technologies such as Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) depend on the availability
of infrastructure. We define the Infrastructure Provider (InP) as the actor
responsible for deploying and maintaining this infrastructure, while Service
Providers (SPs) operate applications over it to serve end users and earn
revenues. Deploying such infrastructure requires however a significant
investment, and the InP may be reluctant to bear it alone. We propose
co-investment to overcome this barrier, allowing players, the InP and multiple
SPs, to share costs and revenues. However, committing to a co-investment over a
long period may be too constraining for players: in an unforeseeable future,
players may realize that they could make more profit outside the co-investment
(such a profit is called opportunity cost). For this reason, we propose a
scheme, based on coalitional game theory, which is dynamic in terms of
(i)allowing players to join, remain in, or leave the co-investment, (ii)
adjusting the infrastructure capacity and resource sharing over time. We
propose a method to compute entry fees and exit penalties in order to
appropriately compensate players remaining in the co-investment. We numerically
show that our dynamic scheme encourages player participation and increases
profit (in case of high opportunity cost).

TL;DR: 本文重现了Axelrod第二场囚徒困境迭代竞赛，验证了TFT策略的成功，并评估了原始策略在不同环境下的稳健性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Axelrod在1980年代组织的两场囚徒困境迭代竞赛对合作演化研究具有重要影响，但历史档案不完整，缺乏可重现性。

Method: 通过恢复幸存的Fortran实现，构建Python接口调用原始策略函数，使用Axelrod-Python库运行竞赛。

Result: 成功重现Axelrod的主要发现：TFT胜出，成功策略具有合作性、对背叛的响应性和宽恕性。原始竞赛特别有利于TFT，但在更多样化环境中一些较少被关注的策略表现强劲。

Conclusion: 首次系统重现Axelrod第二场竞赛，为原始结果提供当代重新评估，并将第二场竞赛策略保存在Axelrod-Python中支持未来研究。

Abstract: Direct reciprocity, typically studied using the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma
(IPD), is central to understanding how cooperation evolves. In the 1980s,
Robert Axelrod organized two influential IPD computer tournaments, where Tit
for Tat (TFT) emerged as the winner. Yet the archival record is incomplete: for
the first tournament only a report survives, and for the second the submitted
Fortran strategies remain but not the final tournament code. This gap raises
questions about the reproducibility of these historically influential results.
We recreate the second tournament by restoring the surviving Fortran
implementations to compile with modern compilers and by building a Python
interface that calls the original strategy functions without modification.
Using the open-source Axelrod-Python library to run tournaments, we reproduce
Axelrod's main findings: TFT prevails, and successful play tends to be
cooperative, responsive to defection, and willing to forgive. Strategy rankings
remain mostly unchanged. We then assess the robustness of the originally
submitted strategies by incorporating additional strategies, and we run one of
the largest IPD tournaments to date. We find that the original tournament was
especially favorable to TFT and that it is difficult to dethrone TFT when the
original submissions make up the majority of the field. We also observe that
several lesser-known submissions perform strongly in more diverse settings and
under noise. Our contributions are: (i) the first systematic reproduction of
Axelrod's second tournament; (ii) a contemporary reassessment of the original
results in light of new strategies and settings; and (iii) a preserved,
easy-to-use implementation of the second-tournament strategies within
Axelrod-Python to support future research.

TL;DR: 本文扩展了逆博弈理论，提出了主动逆博弈方法，让领导者作为学习者主动选择行动来更好地理解追随者的成本函数，通过主动探索能更快达到Stackelberg均衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的逆博弈理论方法没有将学习者视为游戏的主动参与者，这限制了学习过程的效果。本文旨在让领导者作为主动学习者来增强对追随者成本函数的理解。

Method: 开发了两种方法：1）利用Fisher信息最大化未知参数信息增益的主动学习方法；2）考虑领导者成本的主动逆博弈方法，平衡探索与利用。

Result: 证明了方法的一致性和渐近正态性，在二次成本函数情况下证明了渐近Stackelberg均衡。仿真验证了主动逆博弈方法能通过主动探索更快达到Stackelberg均衡。

Conclusion: 主动逆博弈方法有效提升了学习效率，通过主动探索能更快收敛到Stackelberg均衡，为逆博弈理论提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Inverse game theory is utilized to infer the cost functions of all players
based on game outcomes. However, existing inverse game theory methods do not
consider the learner as an active participant in the game, which could
significantly enhance the learning process. In this paper, we extend inverse
game theory to active inverse methods. For Stackelberg games with bounded
rationality, the leader, acting as a learner, actively chooses actions to
better understand the follower's cost functions. First, we develop a method of
active learning by leveraging Fisher information to maximize information gain
about the unknown parameters and prove the consistency and asymptotic
normality. Additionally, when leaders consider its cost, we develop a method of
active inverse game to balance exploration and exploitation, and prove the
consistency and asymptotic Stackelberg equilibrium with quadratic cost
functions. Finally, we verify the properties of these methods through
simulations in the quadratic case and demonstrate that the active inverse game
method can achieve Stackelberg equilibrium more quickly through active
exploration.

Conclusion: 提出的并行APO实现通过GPU加速有效解决了元启发式算法执行时间过长的问题，显著提升了算法性能，适用于复杂优化问题的求解。

Abstract: Metaheuristic algorithms are widely used for solving complex problems due to
their ability to provide near-optimal solutions. But the execution time of
these algorithms increases with the problem size and solution space. And, to
get more promising results, we have to execute these algorithms for a large
number of iterations, requiring a large amount of time and this is one of the
main issues found with these algorithms. To handle the same, researchers are
now-adays working on design and development of parallel versions of state of
the art metaheuristic optimization algorithms. We, in this paper, present a
parallel implementation of state of the art Artificial Protozoa Optimizer using
NVIDIA CUDA framework to leverage GPU acceleration. Our implementation
optimizes the state of the art Artificial Protozoa Optimizer (APO) to achieve
high performance. We implement both the existing sequential version and the
proposed parallel version of Artificial Protozoa Optimizer in this paper. The
experimental results calculated over benchmarks functions of CEC2022
demonstrate a significant performance gain i.e. up to 6.7 times speed up
achieved in case of proposed parallel version. We also use two real world
applications (1) Tension/Compression Spring Design in engineering optimization
and (2) Image Thresholding using otsu method for testing the performance of
proposed implementation in handling real tasks.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: SpikeFit是一种新型的脉冲神经网络训练方法，通过联合优化离散权重值和模型参数，实现高效的神经形态硬件部署，支持低精度（2/4/8位）权重和有限连接数约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SNN压缩方法只能处理数值精度或神经元数量等部分硬件约束，无法全面满足神经形态硬件的严格限制（如芯片容量、低比特表示等）。

Method: 将允许的权重离散值作为可学习参数与模型共同优化，实现聚类感知训练；引入硬件友好的Fisher Spike Contribution剪枝方法。

Result: 在仅使用4个唯一突触权重值的情况下，SpikeFit超越了现有SNN压缩方法和传统基线，满足更广泛的硬件要求并提供最低能耗。

Conclusion: SpikeFit通过联合离散权重优化，实现了对神经形态硬件约束的最完整部署支持，在压缩效率和能耗方面达到最优性能。

Abstract: This paper introduces SpikeFit, a novel training method for Spiking Neural
Networks (SNNs) that enables efficient inference on neuromorphic hardware,
considering all its stringent requirements: the number of neurons and synapses
that can fit on a single device, and lower bit-width representations (e.g.,
4-bit, 8-bit). Unlike conventional compressing approaches that address only a
subset of these requirements (limited numerical precision and limited number of
neurons in the network), SpikeFit treats the allowed weights' discrete values
themselves as learnable parameters co-optimized with the model, allowing for
optimal Clusterization-Aware Training (CAT) of the model's weights at low
precision (2-, 4-, or 8-bit) which results in higher network compression
efficiency, as well as limiting the number of unique synaptic connections to a
value required by neuromorphic processor. This joint optimization allows
SpikeFit to find a discrete weight set aligned with hardware constraints,
enabling the most complete deployment across a broader range of neuromorphic
processors than existing methods of SNN compression support. Moreover, SpikeFit
introduces a new hardware-friendly Fisher Spike Contribution (FSC) pruning
method showing the state-of-the-art performance. We demonstrate that for
spiking neural networks constrained to only four unique synaptic weight values
(M = 4), our SpikeFit method not only outperforms state-of-the-art SNNs
compression methods and conventional baselines combining extreme quantization
schemes and clustering algorithms, but also meets a wider range of neuromorphic
hardware requirements and provides the lowest energy use in experiments.
