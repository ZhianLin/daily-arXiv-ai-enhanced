### [1] [Hybrid Deep Learning for Hyperspectral Single Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00033)
*Usman Muhammad,Jorma Laaksonen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SSUF模块和空间-光谱梯度损失函数，通过光谱解混和光谱-空间特征提取提升高光谱图像超分辨率性能，在保持光谱保真度的同时恢复空间细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在高光谱单图像超分辨率任务中难以同时恢复精细空间细节和保持宽波长范围内的光谱保真度，限制了性能表现。

Method: 提出可无缝集成到标准2D卷积架构中的光谱-空间解混融合(SSUF)模块，结合光谱解混与光谱-空间特征提取，指导基于ResNet的CNN进行改进重建；同时设计包含空间和光谱梯度分量的自定义空间-光谱梯度损失函数。

Result: 在三个公共遥感高光谱数据集上的实验表明，所提出的混合深度学习模型在降低模型复杂度的同时实现了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: SSUF模块和空间-光谱梯度损失函数有效提升了高光谱图像超分辨率重建的质量，在保持光谱完整性的同时改善了空间分辨率。

Abstract: Hyperspectral single image super-resolution (SISR) is a challenging task due
to the difficulty of restoring fine spatial details while preserving spectral
fidelity across a wide range of wavelengths, which limits the performance of
conventional deep learning models. To address this challenge, we introduce
Spectral-Spatial Unmixing Fusion (SSUF), a novel module that can be seamlessly
integrated into standard 2D convolutional architectures to enhance both spatial
resolution and spectral integrity. The SSUF combines spectral unmixing with
spectral--spatial feature extraction and guides a ResNet-based convolutional
neural network for improved reconstruction. In addition, we propose a custom
Spatial-Spectral Gradient Loss function that integrates mean squared error with
spatial and spectral gradient components, encouraging accurate reconstruction
of both spatial and spectral features. Experiments on three public remote
sensing hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the proposed hybrid deep
learning model achieves competitive performance while reducing model
complexity.

### [2] [Review of Hallucination Understanding in Large Language and Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00034)
*Zhengyi Ho,Siyuan Liang,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一的多层次框架来表征图像和文本幻觉，通过任务-模态交织方法将幻觉与模型生命周期中的特定机制联系起来，揭示幻觉源于数据分布的可预测模式和继承的偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言和视觉模型在现实应用中的广泛采用使得解决幻觉问题变得紧迫，这些错误会在部署过程中传播错误信息，造成财务和运营损害。当前对幻觉的理解仍不完整且碎片化，缺乏连贯理解会导致解决方案只能缓解表面症状而非根本原因。

Method: 提出了统一的多层次框架来表征图像和文本幻觉，采用任务-模态交织方法将幻觉与模型生命周期中的特定机制联系起来。

Result: 研究发现幻觉通常源于数据分布的可预测模式和继承的偏见。

Conclusion: 通过深化对幻觉的理解，这项调查为在现实世界生成式AI系统中开发更稳健有效的幻觉解决方案奠定了基础。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language and vision models in real-world
applications has made urgent the need to address hallucinations -- instances
where models produce incorrect or nonsensical outputs. These errors can
propagate misinformation during deployment, leading to both financial and
operational harm. Although much research has been devoted to mitigating
hallucinations, our understanding of it is still incomplete and fragmented.
Without a coherent understanding of hallucinations, proposed solutions risk
mitigating surface symptoms rather than underlying causes, limiting their
effectiveness and generalizability in deployment. To tackle this gap, we first
present a unified, multi-level framework for characterizing both image and text
hallucinations across diverse applications, aiming to reduce conceptual
fragmentation. We then link these hallucinations to specific mechanisms within
a model's lifecycle, using a task-modality interleaved approach to promote a
more integrated understanding. Our investigations reveal that hallucinations
often stem from predictable patterns in data distributions and inherited
biases. By deepening our understanding, this survey provides a foundation for
developing more robust and effective solutions to hallucinations in real-world
generative AI systems.

### [3] [POVQA: Preference-Optimized Video Question Answering with Rationales for Data Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01009)
*Ashim Dahal,Ankit Ghimire,Saydul Akbar Murad,Nick Rahimi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了POVQA方法，通过时间池化将每秒视频压缩为单张图像，结合轻量级监督对齐大型视觉语言模型，显著提升视频问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频问答方法虽然能处理1500+帧的长视频，但仅对应50秒视频内容，存在信息压缩效率低的问题。

Method: 使用多种时间池化方法（运动模糊、加权平均等）生成1fps输入，在ReasonVQA数据集上对QWEN-2.5-VL 7B进行监督微调和直接偏好优化。

Result: 在ReasonVQA数据集上，F1分数从0.212提升至0.543，BLEU-4从0.031提升至0.291，ROUGE-L从0.196提升至0.528，推理质量显著提高。

Conclusion: 该方法在不同池化方案下均保持性能提升，显示出对时间证据总结的强鲁棒性，在TVQA数据集上的零样本测试也得到类似结果。

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VQA) with Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) has
gained significant traction in research ever since the Flamingo was introduced
by Deepmind. Recent advancements in large context/long video question answering
have allowed VQA tasks to have context window of 1500+ frames. However, this
only leads to 50 seconds of video footage without losing any significant
information. We introduce POVQA, a data-efficient pipeline that compresses each
second of video into a single temporally pooled image (via motion blur and
weighted averaging variants) and then align LVLMs with lightweight supervision.
Concretely, we build 1 fps input sources using Blend Blur with Last Frame,
Weighted Average, Exponential and Ramp pooling and fine-tune QWEN-2.5-VL 7B
with supervised two turn target including reasoning and final answer. We apply
Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on our
novel dataset ReasonVQA consisting of 12 movies with 239 human annotated
question-answer with reasoning prompts. On our ReasonVQA dataset, this method
dramatically improves performance over pooled baselines: F1 score improves from
0.212 to 0.543, BLEU-4 from 0.031 to 0.291, and ROUGE-L from 0.196 to 0.528.
Rationale quality also significantly increases. Cross-evaluation of SFT + DPO
on various pooling functions show that the gains persist regardless of the
pooling scheme used at train or test time, indicating strong robustness on
summarization of temporal evidence. Similar observations were made on zero-shot
in TVQA.

### [4] [On Robustness of Vision-Language-Action Model against Multi-Modal Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00037)
*Jianing Guo,Zhenhong Wu,Chang Tu,Yiyao Ma,Xiangqi Kong,Zhiqian Liu,Jiaming Ji,Shuning Zhang,Yuanpei Chen,Kai Chen,Xianglong Liu,Qi Dou,Yaodong Yang,Huijie Zhao,Weifeng Lv,Simin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了RobustVLA方法，通过多模态鲁棒性优化来增强视觉-语言-动作模型的抗干扰能力，在17种扰动下显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型主要针对简单的视觉扰动，忽略了动作、指令、环境和观测等多模态扰动，需要开发全面的多模态鲁棒性方法

Method: 采用离线鲁棒优化对抗最坏情况动作噪声，通过多臂老虎机问题建模多扰动场景，使用上置信界算法自动识别最有害噪声

Result: 在LIBERO基准上，RobustVLA相比基线在17种扰动下分别获得12.6%和10.4%的绝对提升，推理速度快50.6倍，在真实FR5机器人上获得65.6%的绝对提升

Conclusion: RobustVLA通过多模态鲁棒性优化有效提升了VLA模型在真实世界扰动下的性能，特别是在动作模态上表现突出

Abstract: In Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, robustness to real-world
perturbations is critical for deployment. Existing methods target simple visual
disturbances, overlooking the broader multi-modal perturbations that arise in
actions, instructions, environments, and observations. Here, we first evaluate
the robustness of mainstream VLAs under 17 perturbations across four
modalities. We find (1) actions as the most fragile modality, (2) Existing
visual-robust VLA do not gain robustness in other modality, and (3) pi0
demonstrates superior robustness with a diffusion-based action head. To build
multi-modal robust VLAs, we propose RobustVLA against perturbations in VLA
inputs and outputs. For output robustness, we perform offline robust
optimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in flow
matching objective. This can be seen as adversarial training, label smoothing,
and outlier penalization. For input robustness, we enforce consistent actions
across input variations that preserve task semantics. To account for multiple
perturbations, we formulate robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and
apply an upper confidence bound algorithm to automatically identify the most
harmful noise. Experiments on LIBERO demonstrate our RobustVLA delivers
absolute gains over baselines of 12.6% on the pi0 backbone and 10.4% on the
OpenVLA backbone across all 17 perturbations, achieving 50.6x faster inference
than existing visual-robust VLAs, and a 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations.
Our RobustVLA is particularly effective on real-world FR5 robot with limited
demonstrations, showing absolute gains by 65.6% under perturbations of four
modalities.

### [5] [Code2Video: A Code-centric Paradigm for Educational Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01174)
*Yanzhe Chen,Kevin Qinghong Lin,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Code2Video是一个基于代码的智能体框架，通过可执行Python代码生成教育视频，包含规划器、编码器和批评器三个协作智能体，在MMMC基准测试中表现优于直接代码生成方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型难以制作专业教育视频，因为教育视频需要学科知识、精确视觉结构和连贯过渡，这些需求更适合通过可渲染环境的操作来实现。

Method: 提出Code2Video框架，包含三个智能体：规划器构建内容流程和视觉资源；编码器将结构化指令转换为可执行Python代码，采用范围引导自动修复；批评器利用视觉语言模型优化空间布局和清晰度。

Result: 在MMMC基准测试中，Code2Video相比直接代码生成方法有40%的改进，生成的视频质量与人工制作的教程相当。

Conclusion: Code2Video展示了作为可扩展、可解释和可控方法的潜力，为教育视频生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: While recent generative models advance pixel-space video synthesis, they
remain limited in producing professional educational videos, which demand
disciplinary knowledge, precise visual structures, and coherent transitions,
limiting their applicability in educational scenarios. Intuitively, such
requirements are better addressed through the manipulation of a renderable
environment, which can be explicitly controlled via logical commands (e.g.,
code). In this work, we propose Code2Video, a code-centric agent framework for
generating educational videos via executable Python code. The framework
comprises three collaborative agents: (i) Planner, which structures lecture
content into temporally coherent flows and prepares corresponding visual
assets; (ii) Coder, which converts structured instructions into executable
Python codes while incorporating scope-guided auto-fix to enhance efficiency;
and (iii) Critic, which leverages vision-language models (VLM) with visual
anchor prompts to refine spatial layout and ensure clarity. To support
systematic evaluation, we build MMMC, a benchmark of professionally produced,
discipline-specific educational videos. We evaluate MMMC across diverse
dimensions, including VLM-as-a-Judge aesthetic scores, code efficiency, and
particularly, TeachQuiz, a novel end-to-end metric that quantifies how well a
VLM, after unlearning, can recover knowledge by watching the generated videos.
Our results demonstrate the potential of Code2Video as a scalable,
interpretable, and controllable approach, achieving 40% improvement over direct
code generation and producing videos comparable to human-crafted tutorials. The
code and datasets are available at https://github.com/showlab/Code2Video.

### [6] [Uncovering Intrinsic Capabilities: A Paradigm for Data Curation in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00040)
*Junjie Li,Ziao Wang,Jianghong Ma,Xiaofeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADC框架通过无监督发现模型内在能力，基于梯度学习轨迹和影响力估计来筛选训练数据，仅用5%数据就能超越全数据训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统指令调优方法将模型视为黑盒，忽视其潜在学习能力，导致数据预算减少时性能下降。

Method: 无监督发现内在能力，通过梯度学习轨迹进行能力归因，使用平衡选择和分阶段排序来构建能力感知课程。

Result: 仅使用5%原始数据就在多模态基准测试中超越了全数据训练效果。

Conclusion: 内在能力是模型学习的基本构建块，CADC为指令数据筛选提供了原则性范式。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong benchmark performance, but
controlling their behavior through instruction tuning remains difficult.
Reducing the budget of instruction tuning dataset often causes regressions, as
heuristic strategies treat models as black boxes and overlook the latent
capabilities that govern learning. We introduce Capability-Attributed Data
Curation (CADC), a framework that shifts curation from task-specific heuristics
to intrinsic capability analysis. CADC discovers intrinsic capabilities in an
unsupervised manner from gradient-based learning trajectories, attributes
training data to these capabilities via influence estimation, and curates
capability-aware curricula through balanced selection and staged sequencing.
This transforms black-box instruction tuning into a controllable,
capability-driven process. With as little as 5% of the original data, CADC
surpasses full-data training on multimodal benchmarks. These results validate
intrinsic capabilities as the fundamental building blocks of model learning and
establish CADC as a principle paradigm for instruction data curation.

### [7] [Culture In a Frame: C$^3$B as a Comic-Based Benchmark for Multimodal Culturally Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00041)
*Yuchen Song,Andong Chen,Wenxin Zhu,Kehai Chen,Xuefeng Bai,Muyun Yang,Tiejun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了C³B基准，这是一个多文化、多任务、多语言的文化意识能力基准，包含2000多张图片和18000多个问答对，用于评估多模态大语言模型的文化意识能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试在任务设计上缺乏渐进难度，缺少跨语言任务，且使用真实世界图像（通常只包含一种文化）使得基准相对容易。

Method: 构建C³B基准，包含三个难度递增的任务：基础视觉识别、高级文化冲突理解、文化内容生成，涵盖多种文化和语言。

Result: 评估了11个开源MLLMs，发现MLLMs与人类表现之间存在显著性能差距，表明C³B对当前MLLMs构成重大挑战。

Conclusion: C³B基准为MLLMs的文化意识能力提供了重要评估工具，鼓励未来研究推进MLLMs的文化意识能力发展。

Abstract: Cultural awareness capabilities has emerged as a critical capability for
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, current benchmarks lack
progressed difficulty in their task design and are deficient in cross-lingual
tasks. Moreover, current benchmarks often use real-world images. Each
real-world image typically contains one culture, making these benchmarks
relatively easy for MLLMs. Based on this, we propose C$^3$B ($\textbf{C}$omics
$\textbf{C}$ross-$\textbf{C}$ultural $\textbf{B}$enchmark), a novel
multicultural, multitask and multilingual cultural awareness capabilities
benchmark. C$^3$B comprises over 2000 images and over 18000 QA pairs,
constructed on three tasks with progressed difficulties, from basic visual
recognition to higher-level cultural conflict understanding, and finally to
cultural content generation. We conducted evaluations on 11 open-source MLLMs,
revealing a significant performance gap between MLLMs and human performance.
The gap demonstrates that C$^3$B poses substantial challenges for current
MLLMs, encouraging future research to advance the cultural awareness
capabilities of MLLMs.

### [8] [Beyond the Prompt: Gender Bias in Text-to-Image Models, with a Case Study on Hospital Professions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00045)
*Franck Vandewiele,Remi Synave,Samuel Delepoulle,Remi Cozot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了6个开源文本到图像模型中的性别偏见问题，发现这些模型在医疗职业描绘中存在系统性性别刻板印象，且不同模型对提示词的敏感度差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像模型在专业、教育和创意场景中应用日益广泛，但其输出常常嵌入和放大社会偏见，特别是性别刻板印象。

Method: 使用精心设计的提示词，为5种医院相关职业和5种肖像修饰词组合生成100张图像，分析6个先进开源模型的性别表现。

Result: 所有模型都表现出系统性职业刻板印象：护士被完全描绘为女性，外科医生主要为男性。不同模型差异明显，Qwen-Image和SDXL强制男性主导，FLUX.1-dev偏向女性，提示词修饰语也显著影响性别平衡。

Conclusion: TTI模型中的性别偏见既系统化又模型特定，提示词措辞对人口统计结果起关键作用，需要偏见过滤设计、平衡默认值和用户指导来防止职业刻板印象的强化。

Abstract: Text-to-image (TTI) models are increasingly used in professional,
educational, and creative contexts, yet their outputs often embed and amplify
social biases. This paper investigates gender representation in six
state-of-the-art open-weight models: HunyuanImage 2.1, HiDream-I1-dev,
Qwen-Image, FLUX.1-dev, Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large, and Stable-Diffusion-XL.
Using carefully designed prompts, we generated 100 images for each combination
of five hospital-related professions (cardiologist, hospital director, nurse,
paramedic, surgeon) and five portrait qualifiers ("", corporate, neutral,
aesthetic, beautiful).
  Our analysis reveals systematic occupational stereotypes: all models produced
nurses exclusively as women and surgeons predominantly as men. However,
differences emerge across models: Qwen-Image and SDXL enforce rigid male
dominance, HiDream-I1-dev shows mixed outcomes, and FLUX.1-dev skews female in
most roles. HunyuanImage 2.1 and Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large also reproduce
gender stereotypes but with varying degrees of sensitivity to prompt
formulation. Portrait qualifiers further modulate gender balance, with terms
like corporate reinforcing male depictions and beautiful favoring female ones.
Sensitivity varies widely: Qwen-Image remains nearly unaffected, while
FLUX.1-dev, SDXL, and SD3.5 show strong prompt dependence.
  These findings demonstrate that gender bias in TTI models is both systematic
and model-specific. Beyond documenting disparities, we argue that prompt
wording plays a critical role in shaping demographic outcomes. The results
underscore the need for bias-aware design, balanced defaults, and user guidance
to prevent the reinforcement of occupational stereotypes in generative AI.

### [9] [Reinforcement Learning-Based Prompt Template Stealing for Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00046)
*Xiaotian Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RLStealer是一个基于强化学习的提示词窃取框架，能够仅通过少量示例图像恢复文本到图像模型的提示模板，攻击成本仅为现有方法的13%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)在文本到图像工作流程中存在的安全风险，即精心设计的提示词可能被窃取，这对蓬勃发展的提示词交易市场构成威胁。

Method: 将模板窃取建模为顺序决策问题，采用基于相似度的多反馈信号作为奖励函数，有效探索提示空间。

Result: 在公开基准测试中取得最先进性能，攻击成本降低至基线方法的13%以下，并能有效泛化到不同图像风格以窃取未见过的提示模板。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了提示词交易中固有的紧急安全威胁，为新兴MLLMs市场制定保护标准奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have transformed text-to-image
workflows, allowing designers to create novel visual concepts with
unprecedented speed. This progress has given rise to a thriving prompt trading
market, where curated prompts that induce trademark styles are bought and sold.
Although commercially attractive, prompt trading also introduces a largely
unexamined security risk: the prompts themselves can be stolen.
  In this paper, we expose this vulnerability and present RLStealer, a
reinforcement learning based prompt inversion framework that recovers its
template from only a small set of example images. RLStealer treats template
stealing as a sequential decision making problem and employs multiple
similarity based feedback signals as reward functions to effectively explore
the prompt space. Comprehensive experiments on publicly available benchmarks
demonstrate that RLStealer gets state-of-the-art performance while reducing the
total attack cost to under 13% of that required by existing baselines. Our
further analysis confirms that RLStealer can effectively generalize across
different image styles to efficiently steal unseen prompt templates. Our study
highlights an urgent security threat inherent in prompt trading and lays the
groundwork for developing protective standards in the emerging MLLMs
marketplace.

### [10] [Explanation-Driven Counterfactual Testing for Faithfulness in Vision-Language Model Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00047)
*Sihao Ding,Santosh Vasa,Aditi Ramadwar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出EDCT方法，通过生成反事实图像来验证视觉语言模型的解释是否忠实反映预测的因果因素


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型产生的自然语言解释听起来可信但可能不反映真实的因果因素，这种可信度与忠实性不匹配带来技术和治理风险

Method: EDCT方法：获取模型答案和解释→解析解释为可测试的视觉概念→通过生成修复生成针对性反事实编辑→使用LLM辅助分析计算反事实一致性分数

Result: 在120个OK-VQA示例和多个VLM上，EDCT揭示了显著的忠实性差距，并提供了监管对齐的审计证据

Conclusion: EDCT能够自动验证VLM解释的忠实性，识别出被引用概念未能通过因果测试的情况

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often produce fluent Natural Language
Explanations (NLEs) that sound convincing but may not reflect the causal
factors driving predictions. This mismatch of plausibility and faithfulness
poses technical and governance risks. We introduce Explanation-Driven
Counterfactual Testing (EDCT), a fully automated verification procedure for a
target VLM that treats the model's own explanation as a falsifiable hypothesis.
Given an image-question pair, EDCT: (1) obtains the model's answer and NLE, (2)
parses the NLE into testable visual concepts, (3) generates targeted
counterfactual edits via generative inpainting, and (4) computes a
Counterfactual Consistency Score (CCS) using LLM-assisted analysis of changes
in both answers and explanations. Across 120 curated OK-VQA examples and
multiple VLMs, EDCT uncovers substantial faithfulness gaps and provides
regulator-aligned audit artifacts indicating when cited concepts fail causal
tests.

### [11] [HiDe: Rethinking The Zoom-IN method in High Resolution MLLMs via Hierarchical Decoupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00054)
*Xianjie Liu,Yiman Hu,Yixiong Zou,Liang Wu,Jian Xu,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了HiDe框架，通过Token-wise Attention Decoupling和Layout-Preserving Decoupling解决多模态大语言模型在高分辨率图像中因复杂背景干扰导致的性能下降问题，无需训练即可显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法认为MLLMs在高分辨率图像中表现不佳是因为感知限制和无法识别小物体，但本文分析发现主要问题其实是复杂背景干扰，而非物体大小。

Method: 提出分层解耦框架HiDe：1) Token-wise Attention Decoupling解耦问题token并识别关键信息token；2) Layout-Preserving Decoupling解耦目标区域与背景，重建紧凑表示保留空间布局。

Result: 在V*Bench、HRBench4K和HRBench8K上达到新的SOTA，将Qwen2.5-VL 7B和InternVL3 8B分别提升至92.1%和91.6%，甚至超过RL方法，内存使用减少75%。

Conclusion: HiDe框架有效解决了MLLMs在高分辨率图像中的背景干扰问题，无需训练即可显著提升性能，为高分辨率视觉理解提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides in
visual understanding tasks. However, their performance on high-resolution
images remains suboptimal. While existing approaches often attribute this
limitation to perceptual constraints and argue that MLLMs struggle to recognize
small objects, leading them to use "zoom in" strategies for better detail, our
analysis reveals a different cause: the main issue is not object size, but
rather caused by complex background interference. We systematically analyze
this "zoom in" operation through a series of decoupling experiments and propose
the Hierarchical Decoupling Framework (HiDe), a training-free framework that
uses Token-wise Attention Decoupling (TAD) to decouple the question tokens and
identify the key information tokens, then leverages their attention weights to
achieve precise alignment with the target visual regions. Subsequently, it
employs Layout-Preserving Decoupling (LPD) to decouple these regions from the
background and reconstructs a compact representation that preserves essential
spatial layouts while eliminating background interference. HiDe sets a new SOTA
on V*Bench, HRBench4K, and HRBench8K, boosting Qwen2.5-VL 7B and InternVL3 8B
to SOTA (92.1% and 91.6% on V*Bench), even surpassing RL methods. After
optimization, HiDe uses 75% less memory than the previous training-free
approach. Code is provided in https://github.com/Tennine2077/HiDe.

### [12] [FSDENet: A Frequency and Spatial Domains based Detail Enhancement Network for Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00059)
*Jiahao Fu,Yinfeng Yu,Liejun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了FSDENet网络，通过结合空间域和频域信息来增强遥感图像分割的细节处理能力，特别针对灰度变化导致的语义边缘模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决遥感图像分割中因灰度变化（如阴影和低对比度区域）导致的语义边缘模糊问题，需要充分利用空间信息并增强细节处理能力。

Method: 使用空间处理方法提取多尺度空间特征和细粒度语义细节，通过FFT整合全局和频域信息，利用Haar小波变换分解特征为高、低频分量来优化边界分割。

Result: 在LoveDA、Vaihingen、Potsdam和iSAID四个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: FSDENet通过空间粒度和频域边缘敏感性的双域协同，显著提高了边界区域和灰度过渡区的分割精度。

Abstract: To fully leverage spatial information for remote sensing image segmentation
and address semantic edge ambiguities caused by grayscale variations (e.g.,
shadows and low-contrast regions), we propose the Frequency and Spatial Domains
based Detail Enhancement Network (FSDENet). Our framework employs spatial
processing methods to extract rich multi-scale spatial features and
fine-grained semantic details. By effectively integrating global and
frequency-domain information through the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in global
mappings, the model's capability to discern global representations under
grayscale variations is significantly strengthened. Additionally, we utilize
Haar wavelet transform to decompose features into high- and low-frequency
components, leveraging their distinct sensitivity to edge information to refine
boundary segmentation. The model achieves dual-domain synergy by integrating
spatial granularity with frequency-domain edge sensitivity, substantially
improving segmentation accuracy in boundary regions and grayscale transition
zones. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that FSDENet achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on four widely adopted datasets: LoveDA,
Vaihingen, Potsdam, and iSAID.

*Sheng Yang,Tong Zhan,Guancheng Chen,Yanfeng Lu,Jian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 将自动驾驶重新概念化为广义语言，将轨迹规划任务表述为下一个路径点预测，提出了单阶段端到端自动驾驶框架Max-V1，在nuScenes数据集上达到SOTA性能，比基线提升30%以上


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新思考自动驾驶问题，将其视为序列生成任务，利用VLM的生成能力直接从摄像头输入进行端到端轨迹预测

Method: 单次生成范式，基于统计建模的原则性监督策略，通过模仿学习从大规模专家演示中学习复杂驾驶策略

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上达到最先进性能，整体提升超过30%，在跨域数据集上表现出优异的泛化性能

Conclusion: 该方法为开发更强大的自动驾驶代理奠定了基础，展示了跨车辆鲁棒性和适应性的潜力

Abstract: In this work, we reconceptualize autonomous driving as a generalized language
and formulate the trajectory planning task as next waypoint prediction. We
introduce Max-V1, a novel framework for one-stage end-to-end autonomous
driving. Our framework presents a single-pass generation paradigm that aligns
with the inherent sequentiality of driving. This approach leverages the
generative capacity of the VLM (Vision-Language Model) to enable end-to-end
trajectory prediction directly from front-view camera input. The efficacy of
this method is underpinned by a principled supervision strategy derived from
statistical modeling. This provides a well-defined learning objective, which
makes the framework highly amenable to master complex driving policies through
imitation learning from large-scale expert demonstrations. Empirically, our
method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset,
delivers an overall improvement of over 30% compared to prior baselines.
Furthermore, it exhibits superior generalization performance on cross-domain
datasets acquired from diverse vehicles, demonstrating notable potential for
cross-vehicle robustness and adaptability. Due to these empirical strengths,
this work introduces a model enabling fundamental driving behaviors, laying the
foundation for the development of more capable self-driving agents. Code will

Result: 在14个CNN模型和8个数据集上的实验表明，该方法实现了显著的压缩效果，精度损失最小，优于多种最先进技术。

Abstract: Low-Rank Factorization (LRF) is a widely adopted technique for compressing
deep neural networks (DNNs). However, it faces several challenges, including
optimal rank selection, a vast design space, long fine-tuning times, and
limited compatibility with different layer types and decomposition methods.
This paper presents an end-to-end Design Space Exploration (DSE) methodology
and framework for compressing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that
addresses all these issues. We introduce a novel rank selection strategy based
on feature map similarity, which captures non-linear interactions between layer
outputs more effectively than traditional weight-based approaches. Unlike prior
works, our method uses a one-shot fine-tuning process, significantly reducing
the overall fine-tuning time. The proposed framework is fully compatible with
all types of convolutional (Conv) and fully connected (FC) layers. To further
improve compression, the framework integrates three different LRF techniques
for Conv layers and three for FC layers, applying them selectively on a
per-layer basis. We demonstrate that combining multiple LRF methods within a
single model yields better compression results than using a single method
uniformly across all layers. Finally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation and
comparison of the six LRF techniques, offering practical insights into their
effectiveness across different scenarios. The proposed work is integrated into
TensorFlow 2.x, ensuring compatibility with widely used deep learning
workflows. Experimental results on 14 CNN models across eight datasets
demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves substantial compression with
minimal accuracy loss, outperforming several state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities. However, evaluating their capacity for human-like
understanding in One-Image Guides remains insufficiently explored. One-Image
Guides are a visual format combining text, imagery, and symbols to present
reorganized and structured information for easier comprehension, which are
specifically designed for human viewing and inherently embody the
characteristics of human perception and understanding. Here, we present
OIG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark focused on One-Image Guide understanding
across diverse domains. To reduce the cost of manual annotation, we developed a
semi-automated annotation pipeline in which multiple intelligent agents
collaborate to generate preliminary image descriptions, assisting humans in
constructing image-text pairs. With OIG-Bench, we have conducted a
comprehensive evaluation of 29 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both
proprietary and open-source models. The results show that Qwen2.5-VL-72B
performs the best among the evaluated models, with an overall accuracy of 77%.
Nevertheless, all models exhibit notable weaknesses in semantic understanding
and logical reasoning, indicating that current MLLMs still struggle to
accurately interpret complex visual-text relationships. In addition, we also
demonstrate that the proposed multi-agent annotation system outperforms all
MLLMs in image captioning, highlighting its potential as both a high-quality
image description generator and a valuable tool for future dataset
construction. Datasets are available at https://github.com/XiejcSYSU/OIG-Bench.

Abstract: We introduce Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric post-training framework that unlocks
geospatial reasoning in vision-language models by combining thinking
scaffolding and elevating. In the scaffolding stage, Geo-R1 instills a
``geospatial thinking paradigm" via supervised fine-tuning on synthetic
chain-of-thought exemplars, enabling models to connect visual cues with
geographic priors without costly human reasoning annotations. In the elevating
stage, it uses GRPO-based reinforcement learning on a weakly-supervised
cross-view pairing proxy. This design supplies a verifiable and scalable reward
signal: teaching models to capture and reconcile features across modalities,
and harnessing reasoning for accurate prediction. Geo-R1 extends geospatial
modeling from domain pretraining / supervised finetuning to reasoning-first
post-training, and achieves state-of-the-art performance across various
geospatial reasoning benchmarks. Our model is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于无偏平滑神经元(USN)指标的神经网络剪枝方法，通过移除低USN值的神经元来减少过参数化，同时保持模型表达能力，从而提升对抗语义变换扰动(如亮度和对比度变化)的鲁棒性认证性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 提出的基于USN指标的剪枝方法有效解决了过参数化问题，在保持模型表达能力的同时显著提升了鲁棒性认证的紧致性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have been widely adopted in many vision and robotics
applications with visual inputs. It is essential to verify its robustness
against semantic transformation perturbations, such as brightness and contrast.
However, current certified training and robustness certification methods face
the challenge of over-parameterization, which hinders the tightness and
scalability due to the over-complicated neural networks. To this end, we first
analyze stability and variance of layers and neurons against input
perturbation, showing that certifiable robustness can be indicated by a
fundamental Unbiased and Smooth Neuron metric (USN). Based on USN, we introduce
a novel neural network pruning method that removes neurons with low USN and
retains those with high USN, thereby preserving model expressiveness without
over-parameterization. To further enhance this pruning process, we propose a
new Wasserstein distance loss to ensure that pruned neurons are more
concentrated across layers. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments on the challenging robust keypoint detection task, which involves
realistic brightness and contrast perturbations, demonstrating that our method
achieves superior robustness certification performance and efficiency compared
to baselines.

Conclusion: 提出的基于传输理论和SCDT域建模的方法在超光谱异常检测中表现出优越性能，为复杂环境下的异常检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD), a crucial approach for many civilian
and military applications, seeks to identify pixels with spectral signatures
that are anomalous relative to a preponderance of background signatures.
Significant effort has been made to improve HAD techniques, but challenges
arise due to complex real-world environments and, by definition, limited prior
knowledge of potential signatures of interest. This paper introduces a novel
HAD method by proposing a transport-based mathematical model to describe the
pixels comprising a given hyperspectral image. In this approach, hyperspectral
pixels are viewed as observations of a template pattern undergoing unknown
deformations that enables their representation in the signed cumulative
distribution transform (SCDT) domain. An unsupervised subspace modeling
technique is then used to construct a model of abundant background signals in
this domain, whereupon anomalous signals are detected as deviations from the
learned model. Comprehensive evaluations across five distinct datasets
illustrate the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

Motivation: 生成模型能大规模生成逼真图像，引发检测和溯源的需求。现有水印方法对真实失真敏感、易被移除、更新成本高。

Method: 将编码问题建模为生成模型参数的密钥相关扰动，使用基于路由的MOLM方法，通过二进制密钥激活残差和注意力块中的轻量级LoRA适配器。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion和FLUX上的实验表明，MOLM保持图像质量的同时，对失真、压缩、再生、平均攻击和黑盒对抗攻击具有鲁棒的密钥恢复能力。

Conclusion: MOLM框架实现了不可感知性、保真度、可验证性和鲁棒性，避免了密钥特定的重新训练，为生成图像溯源提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generative models can generate photorealistic images at scale. This raises
urgent concerns about the ability to detect synthetically generated images and
attribute these images to specific sources. While watermarking has emerged as a
possible solution, existing methods remain fragile to realistic distortions,
susceptible to adaptive removal, and expensive to update when the underlying
watermarking key changes. We propose a general watermarking framework that
formulates the encoding problem as key-dependent perturbation of the parameters
of a generative model. Within this framework, we introduce Mixture of LoRA
Markers (MOLM), a routing-based instantiation in which binary keys activate
lightweight LoRA adapters inside residual and attention blocks. This design
avoids key-specific re-training and achieves the desired properties such as
imperceptibility, fidelity, verifiability, and robustness. Experiments on
Stable Diffusion and FLUX show that MOLM preserves image quality while
achieving robust key recovery against distortions, compression and
regeneration, averaging attacks, and black-box adversarial attacks on the
extractor.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放世界目标检测方法存在已知与未知类别间的语义混淆和灾难性遗忘问题，导致未知召回率下降和已知类别准确率退化。

Method: 提出CROWD框架，包含CROWD-Discover（通过最大化子模条件增益函数挖掘与已知对象显著不同的未知实例）和CROWD-Learn（使用组合目标联合解耦已知和未知表示，同时保持已知类别间的判别一致性）。

Result: 在OWOD基准测试中，CROWD在M-OWODB和S-OWODB上分别提升已知类别准确率2.83%和2.05%，未知召回率比领先基线提高近2.4倍。

Conclusion: CROWD通过组合式数据发现和表示学习方法有效解决了开放世界检测中的语义混淆和灾难性遗忘问题，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Open-World Object Detection (OWOD) enriches traditional object detectors by
enabling continual discovery and integration of unknown objects via human
guidance. However, existing OWOD approaches frequently suffer from semantic
confusion between known and unknown classes, alongside catastrophic forgetting,
leading to diminished unknown recall and degraded known-class accuracy. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Combinatorial Open-World Detection
(CROWD), a unified framework reformulating unknown object discovery and
adaptation as an interwoven combinatorial (set-based) data-discovery
(CROWD-Discover) and representation learning (CROWD-Learn) task. CROWD-Discover
strategically mines unknown instances by maximizing Submodular Conditional Gain
(SCG) functions, selecting representative examples distinctly dissimilar from
known objects. Subsequently, CROWD-Learn employs novel combinatorial objectives
that jointly disentangle known and unknown representations while maintaining
discriminative coherence among known classes, thus mitigating confusion and
forgetting. Extensive evaluations on OWOD benchmarks illustrate that CROWD
achieves improvements of 2.83% and 2.05% in known-class accuracy on M-OWODB and
S-OWODB, respectively, and nearly 2.4x unknown recall compared to leading
baselines.

Conclusion: 通过离散小波变换增强VAE潜在空间表示的方法在卫星图像处理中表现出色，为遥感应用中的潜在扩散模型提供了改进方案。

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDM), a subclass of diffusion models, mitigate the
computational complexity of pixel-space diffusion by operating within a
compressed latent space constructed by Variational Autoencoders (VAEs),
demonstrating significant advantages in Remote Sensing (RS) applications.
Though numerous studies enhancing LDMs have been conducted, investigations
explicitly targeting improvements within the intrinsic latent space remain
scarce. This paper proposes an innovative perspective, utilizing the Discrete
Wavelet Transform (DWT) to enhance the VAE's latent space representation,
designed for satellite imagery. The proposed method, ExpDWT-VAE, introduces
dual branches: one processes spatial domain input through convolutional
operations, while the other extracts and processes frequency-domain features
via 2D Haar wavelet decomposition, convolutional operation, and inverse DWT
reconstruction. These branches merge to create an integrated spatial-frequency
representation, further refined through convolutional and diagonal Gaussian
mapping into a robust latent representation. We utilize a new satellite imagery
dataset housed by the TerraFly mapping system to validate our method.
Experimental results across several performance metrics highlight the efficacy
of the proposed method at enhancing latent space representation.

Motivation: 现有轨迹预测方法假设理想化的观测历史，忽略了第一人称视角固有的感知伪影（如遮挡、ID切换、跟踪漂移），导致训练假设与部署现实之间的差距，限制了模型鲁棒性。

Method: 提出BiFlow双流流匹配模型，同时去噪历史观测和预测未来运动；引入EgoAnchor机制，通过特征调制将蒸馏的历史特征条件化到预测解码器。

Result: 在EgoTraj-Bench基准上，BiFlow实现了最先进性能，平均减少minADE和minFDE 10-15%，表现出卓越的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该基准和模型为开发真正能够抵抗真实世界第一人称感知挑战的轨迹预测系统提供了关键基础。

Abstract: Reliable trajectory prediction from an ego-centric perspective is crucial for
robotic navigation in human-centric environments. However, existing methods
typically assume idealized observation histories, failing to account for the
perceptual artifacts inherent in first-person vision, such as occlusions, ID
switches, and tracking drift. This discrepancy between training assumptions and
deployment reality severely limits model robustness. To bridge this gap, we
introduce EgoTraj-Bench, the first real-world benchmark that grounds noisy,
first-person visual histories in clean, bird's-eye-view future trajectories,
enabling robust learning under realistic perceptual constraints. Building on
this benchmark, we propose BiFlow, a dual-stream flow matching model that
concurrently denoises historical observations and forecasts future motion by
leveraging a shared latent representation. To better model agent intent, BiFlow
incorporates our EgoAnchor mechanism, which conditions the prediction decoder
on distilled historical features via feature modulation. Extensive experiments
show that BiFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing minADE and
minFDE by 10-15% on average and demonstrating superior robustness. We
anticipate that our benchmark and model will provide a critical foundation for
developing trajectory forecasting systems truly resilient to the challenges of
real-world, ego-centric perception.

Abstract: The accurate interpretation of chest radiographs using automated methods is a
critical task in medical imaging. This paper presents a comparative analysis
between a supervised lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a
state-of-the-art, zero-shot medical Vision-Language Model (VLM), BiomedCLIP,
across two distinct diagnostic tasks: pneumonia detection on the PneumoniaMNIST
benchmark and tuberculosis detection on the Shenzhen TB dataset. Our
experiments show that supervised CNNs serve as highly competitive baselines in
both cases. While the default zero-shot performance of the VLM is lower, we
demonstrate that its potential can be unlocked via a simple yet crucial remedy:
decision threshold calibration. By optimizing the classification threshold on a
validation set, the performance of BiomedCLIP is significantly boosted across
both datasets. For pneumonia detection, calibration enables the zero-shot VLM
to achieve a superior F1-score of 0.8841, surpassing the supervised CNN's
0.8803. For tuberculosis detection, calibration dramatically improves the
F1-score from 0.4812 to 0.7684, bringing it close to the supervised baseline's
0.7834. This work highlights a key insight: proper calibration is essential for
leveraging the full diagnostic power of zero-shot VLMs, enabling them to match

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) promise human-like interaction with software applications, yet
long-horizon tasks remain challenging due to memory limitations. Existing
approaches either truncate history or rely on simple textual summaries, which
risk losing critical information when past visual details become necessary for
future decisions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{PAL-UI} (\textbf{P}lanning
with \textbf{A}ctive \textbf{L}ook-back), a novel framework that enables GUI
agents to adaptively retrieve past observations when required. PAL-UI combines
a dual-level summarization agent, capturing both observation-level cues and
action-level outcomes, with a dedicated retrieval tool that allows the agent to
recall specific historical screenshots during planning. We curate a step-level
instruction dataset of 8.6K samples from mobile GUI navigation trajectories and
train \textbf{PAL-UI-3B} and \textbf{PAL-UI-7B} models based on Qwen2.5-VL.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that PAL-UI significantly outperforms
baseline models and prior methods in mobile GUI navigation tasks, even under
data-efficient settings. Moreover, PAL-UI exhibits strong cross-domain
generalization, achieving notable improvements in web navigation without
additional training. Our work highlights the potential of active memory
retrieval for long-horizon planning capabilities of vision-based GUI agents.

Abstract: Precise delineation of meningiomas is crucial for effective radiotherapy (RT)
planning, directly influencing treatment efficacy and preservation of adjacent
healthy tissues. While automated deep learning approaches have demonstrated
considerable potential, achieving consistently accurate clinical segmentation
remains challenging due to tumor heterogeneity. Interactive Medical Image
Segmentation (IMIS) addresses this challenge by integrating advanced AI
techniques with clinical input. However, generic segmentation tools, despite
widespread applicability, often lack the specificity required for clinically
critical and disease-specific tasks like meningioma RT planning. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce Interactive-MEN-RT, a dedicated IMIS tool
specifically developed for clinician-assisted 3D meningioma segmentation in RT
workflows. The system incorporates multiple clinically relevant interaction
methods, including point annotations, bounding boxes, lasso tools, and
scribbles, enhancing usability and clinical precision. In our evaluation
involving 500 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans from the BraTS 2025
Meningioma RT Segmentation Challenge, Interactive-MEN-RT demonstrated
substantial improvement compared to other segmentation methods, achieving Dice
similarity coefficients of up to 77.6\% and Intersection over Union scores of
64.8\%. These results emphasize the need for clinically tailored segmentation
solutions in critical applications such as meningioma RT planning. The code is

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型在主题一致视频生成方面存在不足，难以解析包含复杂空间关系、时间逻辑和多主体交互的提示词。

Method: 提出BindWeave框架，采用MLLM-DiT架构，利用预训练多模态大语言模型进行深度跨模态推理，生成主题感知的隐藏状态来指导扩散变换器生成高质量视频。

Result: 在OpenS2V基准测试中，该方法在主题一致性、自然度和文本相关性方面均优于现有开源和商业模型。

Conclusion: BindWeave通过跨模态推理有效解决了复杂提示词解析问题，实现了高质量的主题一致视频生成。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer has shown remarkable abilities in generating
high-fidelity videos, delivering visually coherent frames and rich details over
extended durations. However, existing video generation models still fall short
in subject-consistent video generation due to an inherent difficulty in parsing
prompts that specify complex spatial relationships, temporal logic, and
interactions among multiple subjects. To address this issue, we propose
BindWeave, a unified framework that handles a broad range of subject-to-video
scenarios from single-subject cases to complex multi-subject scenes with
heterogeneous entities. To bind complex prompt semantics to concrete visual
subjects, we introduce an MLLM-DiT framework in which a pretrained multimodal
large language model performs deep cross-modal reasoning to ground entities and
disentangle roles, attributes, and interactions, yielding subject-aware hidden
states that condition the diffusion transformer for high-fidelity
subject-consistent video generation. Experiments on the OpenS2V benchmark
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across subject
consistency, naturalness, and text relevance in generated videos, outperforming
existing open-source and commercial models.

TL;DR: 提出SCNet网络解决自监督去噪中的高频细节丢失和噪声学习问题，通过频率控制、参数优化和频谱分离重建模块提升去噪效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督去噪方法存在高频结构细节保留不足和拟合高频时学习噪声的问题，需要优化频谱特性。

Method: 提出SCNet网络：1)频率带选择策略加速训练；2)用Lipschitz常数限制卷积核学习高频噪声；3)SSR模块通过频域分离和低秩重建分离噪声与高频细节。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验验证了SCNet的有效性。

Conclusion: SCNet通过频谱控制成功解决了自监督去噪中的高频细节保留和噪声学习问题，提升了去噪性能。

Abstract: Current self-supervised denoising methods for paired noisy images typically
involve mapping one noisy image through the network to the other noisy image.
However, after measuring the spectral bias of such methods using our proposed
Image Pair Frequency-Band Similarity, it suffers from two practical
limitations. Firstly, the high-frequency structural details in images are not
preserved well enough. Secondly, during the process of fitting high
frequencies, the network learns high-frequency noise from the mapped noisy
images. To address these challenges, we introduce a Spectral Controlling
network (SCNet) to optimize self-supervised denoising of paired noisy images.
First, we propose a selection strategy to choose frequency band components for
noisy images, to accelerate the convergence speed of training. Next, we present
a parameter optimization method that restricts the learning ability of
convolutional kernels to high-frequency noise using the Lipschitz constant,
without changing the network structure. Finally, we introduce the Spectral
Separation and low-rank Reconstruction module (SSR module), which separates
noise and high-frequency details through frequency domain separation and
low-rank space reconstruction, to retain the high-frequency structural details
of images. Experiments performed on synthetic and real-world datasets verify
the effectiveness of SCNet.

TL;DR: VLOD-TTA是一个用于视觉语言目标检测器的测试时自适应框架，通过IoU加权熵目标和图像条件提示选择来提升模型在域偏移下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言目标检测器在零样本识别方面表现优异，但在面对域偏移时性能会下降，需要一种有效的测试时自适应方法来改善这一状况。

Method: 提出IoU加权熵目标来聚焦于空间一致的建议框簇，减少孤立框的确认偏差；引入图像条件提示选择，根据图像级兼容性对提示进行排序，并将最有信息的提示与检测器logits融合。

Result: 在多样化分布偏移（风格化域、驾驶场景、低光条件和常见损坏）上的基准测试显示，该方法在YOLO-World和Grounding DINO上均优于零样本和TTA基线方法。

Conclusion: VLOD-TTA通过结合密集建议框重叠和图像条件提示评分，有效提升了视觉语言目标检测器在域偏移下的适应能力。

Abstract: Vision-language object detectors (VLODs) such as YOLO-World and Grounding
DINO achieve impressive zero-shot recognition by aligning region proposals with
text representations. However, their performance often degrades under domain
shift. We introduce VLOD-TTA, a test-time adaptation (TTA) framework for VLODs
that leverages dense proposal overlap and image-conditioned prompt scores.
First, an IoU-weighted entropy objective is proposed that concentrates
adaptation on spatially coherent proposal clusters and reduces confirmation
bias from isolated boxes. Second, image-conditioned prompt selection is
introduced, which ranks prompts by image-level compatibility and fuses the most
informative prompts with the detector logits. Our benchmarking across diverse
distribution shifts -- including stylized domains, driving scenes, low-light
conditions, and common corruptions -- shows the effectiveness of our method on
two state-of-the-art VLODs, YOLO-World and Grounding DINO, with consistent
improvements over the zero-shot and TTA baselines. Code :

Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在组合推理方面存在局限，需要建立一个统一的测试平台来评估模型在视觉感知、符号操作和算术一致性方面的综合能力。

Method: 创建包含140万生成实例和精选测试集的基准，涵盖文本引导和纯视觉设置，系统化考虑数字规模、移动复杂度、解决方案多样性和运算符变化。

Conclusion: MathSticks为推进跨视觉和符号的组合推理提供了一个严格的测试平台，揭示了当前模型的不足。

Abstract: We introduce \textsc{MathSticks}, a benchmark for Visual Symbolic
Compositional Reasoning (VSCR), which unifies visual perception, symbolic
manipulation, and arithmetic consistency. Each task presents an incorrect
matchstick equation that must be corrected by moving one or two sticks under
strict conservation rules. The benchmark includes both text-guided and purely
visual settings, systematically covering digit scale, move complexity, solution
multiplicity, and operator variation, with 1.4M generated instances and a
curated test set. Evaluations of 14 vision--language models reveal substantial
limitations: closed-source models succeed only on simple cases, open-source
models fail in the visual regime, while humans exceed 90\% accuracy. These
findings establish \textsc{MathSticks} as a rigorous testbed for advancing
compositional reasoning across vision and symbols. Our code and dataset are

TL;DR: 提出了NAGL框架，利用正常和异常样本作为参考，通过残差挖掘和异常特征学习实现跨领域异常检测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用异常检测方法仅使用正常样本作为参考，忽略了现实场景中可用的异常样本包含的宝贵信息

Method: NAGL框架包含两个关键组件：残差挖掘(RM)从正常-异常参考残差中提取异常模式，异常特征学习(AFL)通过残差映射自适应学习查询图像中的异常特征

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于现有的GAD方法

Conclusion: 这是首个在通用异常检测中采用正常和异常样本混合作为参考的工作，为更准确高效的跨领域异常检测提供了新思路

Abstract: Generalist Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to train a unified model on an
original domain that can detect anomalies in new target domains. Previous GAD
methods primarily use only normal samples as references, overlooking the
valuable information contained in anomalous samples that are often available in
real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a more practical
approach: normal-abnormal-guided generalist anomaly detection, which leverages
both normal and anomalous samples as references to guide anomaly detection
across diverse domains. We introduce the Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning
(NAGL) framework, consisting of two key components: Residual Mining (RM) and
Anomaly Feature Learning (AFL). RM extracts abnormal patterns from
normal-abnormal reference residuals to establish transferable anomaly
representations, while AFL adaptively learns anomaly features in query images
through residual mapping to identify instance-aware anomalies. Our approach
effectively utilizes both normal and anomalous references for more accurate and
efficient cross-domain anomaly detection. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing GAD
approaches. This work represents the first to adopt a mixture of normal and
abnormal samples as references in generalist anomaly detection. The code and
datasets are available at https://github.com/JasonKyng/NAGL.

TL;DR: RAF（相对-绝对融合）是一种高效的特征提取技术，通过同时提取和融合图像表示作为相对特征与对应的数值作为绝对特征，提升基于图像的选择方法在稀疏线性系统求解中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图像的选择方法在特征提取时可能将不同的矩阵编码为相同的图像表示，导致选择相同的方法和次优结果。

Method: 提出RAF特征提取技术，同时提取和融合图像表示（相对特征）与对应的数值（绝对特征），实现全面的矩阵表示，防止不同矩阵间的特征歧义。

Result: 在SuiteSparse和BMCMat数据集上的综合评估显示，RAF将稀疏线性系统的求解时间减少了0.08s-0.29s，比传统基于图像的选择方法快5.86%-11.50%，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: RAF通过相对-绝对特征融合有效提升了基于图像的选择方法的准确性和性能，解锁了这类方法的潜力。

Abstract: Iterative method selection is crucial for solving sparse linear systems
because these methods inherently lack robustness. Though image-based selection
approaches have shown promise, their feature extraction techniques might encode
distinct matrices into identical image representations, leading to the same
selection and suboptimal method. In this paper, we introduce RAF
(Relative-Absolute Fusion), an efficient feature extraction technique to
enhance image-based selection approaches. By simultaneously extracting and
fusing image representations as relative features with corresponding numerical
values as absolute features, RAF achieves comprehensive matrix representations
that prevent feature ambiguity across distinct matrices, thus improving
selection accuracy and unlocking the potential of image-based selection
approaches. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of RAF on SuiteSparse and
our developed BMCMat (Balanced Multi-Classification Matrix dataset),
demonstrating solution time reductions of 0.08s-0.29s for sparse linear
systems, which is 5.86%-11.50% faster than conventional image-based selection
approaches and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. BMCMat is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于生成先验的手部姿态优化方法，通过利用手-物体交互的感知描述来指导扩散模型，在严重遮挡情况下重建更准确且功能连贯的3D手部姿态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决手部严重自遮挡或被物体遮挡时的手部姿态重建问题，受人类利用上下文知识（如物体的形状和功能暗示如何抓握）解决模糊性的启发。

Method: 使用扩散生成模型学习基于感知描述的手部姿态分布，感知描述由大型视觉语言模型推断，从而指导遮挡区域的手部姿态优化。

Result: 在HOGraspNet数据集上的实验表明，该方法在严重遮挡情况下显著优于最近的回归方法和缺乏上下文推理的基于扩散的优化方法。

Conclusion: 感知引导的优化能够显著改善手部姿态估计，特别是在严重遮挡情况下，证明了上下文知识在手部姿态重建中的重要性。

Abstract: How can we reconstruct 3D hand poses when large portions of the hand are
heavily occluded by itself or by objects? Humans often resolve such ambiguities
by leveraging contextual knowledge -- such as affordances, where an object's
shape and function suggest how the object is typically grasped. Inspired by
this observation, we propose a generative prior for hand pose refinement guided
by affordance-aware textual descriptions of hand-object interactions (HOI). Our
method employs a diffusion-based generative model that learns the distribution
of plausible hand poses conditioned on affordance descriptions, which are
inferred from a large vision-language model (VLM). This enables the refinement
of occluded regions into more accurate and functionally coherent hand poses.
Extensive experiments on HOGraspNet, a 3D hand-affordance dataset with severe
occlusions, demonstrate that our affordance-guided refinement significantly
improves hand pose estimation over both recent regression methods and
diffusion-based refinement lacking contextual reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉token在多模态大模型中消耗大量计算资源，现有压缩方法忽视了压缩带来的特征空间扰动导致的训练困难

Method: 通过分解token压缩引入的特征空间扰动，提出token一致性蒸馏和层一致性蒸馏，利用教师模型指导进行渐进式学习

Result: 实验证明该框架具有优越的有效性、鲁棒性和泛化能力

Conclusion: EPIC框架通过渐进式一致性蒸馏有效解决了视觉token压缩带来的训练困难问题

Abstract: Visual tokens consume substantial computational resources in multi-modal
large models (MLLMs), significantly compromising their efficiency. Recent works
have attempted to improve efficiency by compressing visual tokens during
training, either through modifications to model components or by introducing
additional parameters. However, they often overlook the increased learning
difficulty caused by such compression, as the model's parameter space struggles
to quickly adapt to the substantial perturbations in the feature space induced
by token compression. In this work, we propose to develop Efficient MLLMs via
Progressive Consistency Distillation (EPIC), a progressive learning framework.
Specifically, by decomposing the feature space perturbations introduced by
token compression along the token-wise and layer-wise dimensions, we introduce
token consistency distillation and layer consistency distillation,
respectively, aiming to reduce the training difficulty by leveraging guidance
from a teacher model and following a progressive learning trajectory. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness, robustness, and
generalization capabilities of our proposed framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声心动图基础模型缺乏标准化评估基准，现有解决方案多在私有数据上评估，限制了可比性。超声心动图存在噪声采集、高帧冗余和公开数据集有限等独特挑战。

Method: 将8个公开数据集统一为标准化套件，涵盖功能、结构、诊断和视图识别等任务。在一致的零样本、探针和对齐协议下评估心脏专用、生物医学和通用编码器。

Result: 不同模型家族展现出互补优势：时序建模对功能回归至关重要，检索在分布偏移下提供鲁棒性，领域特定文本编码器捕获生理学有意义的轴。通用编码器迁移能力强但难以处理细粒度区分。

Conclusion: CardioBench建立了可复现的参考点，为未来超声心动图基础模型设计提供了可操作的见解。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are reshaping medical imaging, yet their application
in echocardiography remains limited. While several echocardiography-specific
FMs have recently been introduced, no standardized benchmark exists to evaluate
them. Echocardiography poses unique challenges, including noisy acquisitions,
high frame redundancy, and limited public datasets. Most existing solutions
evaluate on private data, restricting comparability. To address this, we
introduce CardioBench, a comprehensive benchmark for echocardiography FMs.
CardioBench unifies eight publicly available datasets into a standardized suite
spanning four regression and five classification tasks, covering functional,
structural, diagnostic, and view recognition endpoints. We evaluate several
leading FM, including cardiac-specific, biomedical, and general-purpose
encoders, under consistent zero-shot, probing, and alignment protocols. Our
results highlight complementary strengths across model families: temporal
modeling is critical for functional regression, retrieval provides robustness
under distribution shift, and domain-specific text encoders capture
physiologically meaningful axes. General-purpose encoders transfer strongly and
often close the gap with probing, but struggle with fine-grained distinctions
like view classification and subtle pathology recognition. By releasing
preprocessing, splits, and public evaluation pipelines, CardioBench establishes
a reproducible reference point and offers actionable insights to guide the
design of future echocardiography foundation models.

Motivation: 现有确定性模型难以处理自遮挡和复杂手部关节引起的姿态模糊性；现有级联方法无法捕捉姿态不确定性；现有概率方法仅限于单阶段估计且缺乏细化能力。

Method: 两阶段级联扩散框架：第一阶段使用关节扩散模型采样多样化的3D关节假设；第二阶段使用网格潜在扩散模型，在关节样本条件下重建3D手部网格。

Result: 在FreiHAND和HO3Dv2数据集上实现最先进性能，有效建模姿态分布。

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合概率建模与级联细化，解决了姿态模糊性问题，提高了3D手部重建的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deterministic models for 3D hand pose reconstruction, whether single-staged
or cascaded, struggle with pose ambiguities caused by self-occlusions and
complex hand articulations. Existing cascaded approaches refine predictions in
a coarse-to-fine manner but remain deterministic and cannot capture pose
uncertainties. Recent probabilistic methods model pose distributions yet are
restricted to single-stage estimation, which often fails to produce accurate 3D
reconstructions without refinement. To address these limitations, we propose a
coarse-to-fine cascaded diffusion framework that combines probabilistic
modeling with cascaded refinement. The first stage is a joint diffusion model
that samples diverse 3D joint hypotheses, and the second stage is a Mesh Latent
Diffusion Model (Mesh LDM) that reconstructs a 3D hand mesh conditioned on a
joint sample. By training Mesh LDM with diverse joint hypotheses in a learned
latent space, our framework learns distribution-aware joint-mesh relationships
and robust hand priors. Furthermore, the cascaded design mitigates the
difficulty of directly mapping 2D images to dense 3D poses, enhancing accuracy
through sequential refinement. Experiments on FreiHAND and HO3Dv2 demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while effectively
modeling pose distributions.

Conclusion: Forestpest-YOLO框架有效解决了林业遥感图像中害虫检测的挑战，为生态保护提供了可靠的技术支持。

Abstract: Detecting agricultural pests in complex forestry environments using remote
sensing imagery is fundamental for ecological preservation, yet it is severely
hampered by practical challenges. Targets are often minuscule, heavily
occluded, and visually similar to the cluttered background, causing
conventional object detection models to falter due to the loss of fine-grained
features and an inability to handle extreme data imbalance. To overcome these
obstacles, this paper introduces Forestpest-YOLO, a detection framework
meticulously optimized for the nuances of forestry remote sensing. Building
upon the YOLOv8 architecture, our framework introduces a synergistic trio of
innovations. We first integrate a lossless downsampling module, SPD-Conv, to
ensure that critical high-resolution details of small targets are preserved
throughout the network. This is complemented by a novel cross-stage feature
fusion block, CSPOK, which dynamically enhances multi-scale feature
representation while suppressing background noise. Finally, we employ
VarifocalLoss to refine the training objective, compelling the model to focus
on high-quality and hard-to-classify samples. Extensive experiments on our
challenging, self-constructed ForestPest dataset demonstrate that
Forestpest-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing marked
improvements in detecting small, occluded pests and significantly outperforming
established baseline models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微生物学图像分析需要大量人工标注数据，过程耗时耗力。本文旨在探索是否可以通过视觉基础模型减少对大量标注数据的依赖，同时保持检测性能。

Method: 构建了5000张培养皿图像数据集，模拟传统数据收集和少样本场景。比较了三种视觉基础模型与传统基线方法在特定任务指标上的表现。

Result: MaskDINO仅用150张图像微调就达到了与大量训练的YoloV9模型相近的性能，在仅25张图像时仍能保持70%样本的可靠检测。

Conclusion: 数据高效的基础模型能够以传统方法所需数据的一小部分实现相当性能，为自动化微生物系统开发提供了更快迭代和更高性能上限的可能性。

Abstract: The process of quantifying mold colonies on Petri dish samples is of critical
importance for the assessment of indoor air quality, as high colony counts can
indicate potential health risks and deficiencies in ventilation systems.
Conventionally the automation of such a labor-intensive process, as well as
other tasks in microbiology, relies on the manual annotation of large datasets
and the subsequent extensive training of models like YoloV9. To demonstrate
that exhaustive annotation is not a prerequisite anymore when tackling a new
vision task, we compile a representative dataset of 5000 Petri dish images
annotated with bounding boxes, simulating both a traditional data collection
approach as well as few-shot and low-shot scenarios with well curated subsets
with instance level masks. We benchmark three vision foundation models against
traditional baselines on task specific metrics, reflecting realistic real-world
requirements. Notably, MaskDINO attains near-parity with an extensively trained
YoloV9 model while finetuned only on 150 images, retaining competitive
performance with as few as 25 images, still being reliable on $\approx$ 70% of
the samples. Our results show that data-efficient foundation models can match
traditional approaches with only a fraction of the required data, enabling
earlier development and faster iterative improvement of automated
microbiological systems with a superior upper-bound performance than
traditional models would achieve.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MoE-MTL方法通常依赖单任务预训练骨干网络，在从单任务学习到多任务学习的过渡过程中存在冗余适应和低效知识共享的问题。

Method: 在基于LoRA的MoE中引入自适应共享专家，共享专家与稀疏专家通过路由器计算的门控权重联合归一化；同时通过增加LoRA专家数量并成比例降低其秩来实现细粒度专家设计。

Result: 在PASCAL-Context基准测试中，在统一训练设置下，ASE在不同配置下持续提升性能，验证了细粒度设计对MTL的有效性。

Conclusion: ASE方法通过自适应共享专家和细粒度专家设计，有效解决了MoE-MTL中的知识共享和专家协作问题，在多个配置下都表现出性能提升。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a powerful framework for multi-task
learning (MTL). However, existing MoE-MTL methods often rely on single-task
pretrained backbones and suffer from redundant adaptation and inefficient
knowledge sharing during the transition from single-task to multi-task learning
(STL to MTL). To address these limitations, we propose adaptive shared experts
(ASE) within a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) based MoE, where shared experts are
assigned router-computed gating weights jointly normalized with sparse experts.
This design facilitates STL to MTL transition, enhances expert specialization,
and cooperation. Furthermore, we incorporate fine-grained experts by increasing
the number of LoRA experts while proportionally reducing their rank, enabling
more effective knowledge sharing under a comparable parameter budget. Extensive
experiments on the PASCAL-Context benchmark, under unified training settings,
demonstrate that ASE consistently improves performance across diverse
configurations and validates the effectiveness of fine-grained designs for MTL.

Motivation: 现有生成式视频帧插值方法只能合成固定数量的中间帧，缺乏调整生成帧率或序列总时长的灵活性。

Method: 提出Timestamp-aware Rotary Position Embedding (TaRoPE)支持任意时间戳插值，采用分段帧合成实现任意长度插值，并设计了外观-运动解耦条件策略确保时空连续性。

Result: 在2x到32x多尺度帧插值基准测试中，ArbInterp在所有场景下都优于先前方法，具有更高的保真度和更无缝的时空连续性。

Conclusion: ArbInterp通过创新的时间戳感知位置编码和分段生成策略，成功实现了任意时间戳和任意长度的视频帧插值，为视频生成应用提供了更大的灵活性。

Abstract: Video frame interpolation (VFI), which generates intermediate frames from
given start and end frames, has become a fundamental function in video
generation applications. However, existing generative VFI methods are
constrained to synthesize a fixed number of intermediate frames, lacking the
flexibility to adjust generated frame rates or total sequence duration. In this
work, we present ArbInterp, a novel generative VFI framework that enables
efficient interpolation at any timestamp and of any length. Specifically, to
support interpolation at any timestamp, we propose the Timestamp-aware Rotary
Position Embedding (TaRoPE), which modulates positions in temporal RoPE to
align generated frames with target normalized timestamps. This design enables
fine-grained control over frame timestamps, addressing the inflexibility of
fixed-position paradigms in prior work. For any-length interpolation, we
decompose long-sequence generation into segment-wise frame synthesis. We
further design a novel appearance-motion decoupled conditioning strategy: it
leverages prior segment endpoints to enforce appearance consistency and
temporal semantics to maintain motion coherence, ensuring seamless
spatiotemporal transitions across segments. Experimentally, we build
comprehensive benchmarks for multi-scale frame interpolation (2x to 32x) to
assess generalizability across arbitrary interpolation factors. Results show
that ArbInterp outperforms prior methods across all scenarios with higher
fidelity and more seamless spatiotemporal continuity. Project website:

### [42] [Multi-level Dynamic Style Transfer for NeRFs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00592)
*Zesheng Li,Shuaibo Li,Wei Ma,Jianwei Guo,Hongbin Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MDS-NeRF提出了一种针对神经辐射场（NeRF）的多级动态风格迁移方法，通过重新设计NeRF流程和引入动态风格注入模块，实现了更好的内容保持和艺术风格化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NeRF风格迁移方法通常将风格统计信息集成到原始NeRF流程中，导致内容保持和艺术风格化效果不佳。

Method: 提出多级特征适配器生成多级特征网格表示，动态风格注入模块学习提取相关风格特征并自适应集成到内容模式中，多级级联解码器将风格化特征转换为最终风格化视图。

Result: 大量实验证明MDS-NeRF在3D风格迁移方面表现优异，能够保持多尺度空间结构同时有效传递风格特征。

Conclusion: 该方法还扩展到支持使用3D风格参考的全视角风格迁移，为NeRF风格迁移提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: As the application of neural radiance fields (NeRFs) in various 3D vision
tasks continues to expand, numerous NeRF-based style transfer techniques have
been developed. However, existing methods typically integrate style statistics
into the original NeRF pipeline, often leading to suboptimal results in both
content preservation and artistic stylization. In this paper, we present
multi-level dynamic style transfer for NeRFs (MDS-NeRF), a novel approach that
reengineers the NeRF pipeline specifically for stylization and incorporates an
innovative dynamic style injection module. Particularly, we propose a
multi-level feature adaptor that helps generate a multi-level feature grid
representation from the content radiance field, effectively capturing the
multi-scale spatial structure of the scene. In addition, we present a dynamic
style injection module that learns to extract relevant style features and
adaptively integrates them into the content patterns. The stylized multi-level
features are then transformed into the final stylized view through our proposed
multi-level cascade decoder. Furthermore, we extend our 3D style transfer
method to support omni-view style transfer using 3D style references. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MDS-NeRF achieves outstanding performance for 3D
style transfer, preserving multi-scale spatial structures while effectively
transferring stylistic characteristics.

TL;DR: 提出了ADPT框架，利用大型视觉语言模型和语义模式匹配，通过迭代自问机制实现无监督的结构缺陷自动标注，准确率高达98%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基础设施安全检测中手动标注成本高、效率低的问题，实现自动化高质量缺陷数据集构建。

Method: 集成大型视觉语言模型与语义模式匹配模块，采用优化的领域特定提示和递归验证过程，通过迭代自问机制进行精炼。

Result: 在区分缺陷与非缺陷图像上达到98%准确率，在四类缺陷标注中达到85%-98%准确率（类别平衡），在类别不平衡数据集上达到80%-92%准确率。

Conclusion: ADPT提供了一个可扩展且经济高效的解决方案，为结构损伤评估中的迁移学习和领域适应等下游任务提供有力支持。

Abstract: Automated structural defect annotation is essential for ensuring
infrastructure safety while minimizing the high costs and inefficiencies of
manual labeling. A novel agentic annotation framework, Agent-based Defect
Pattern Tagger (ADPT), is introduced that integrates Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs) with a semantic pattern matching module and an iterative
self-questioning refinement mechanism. By leveraging optimized domain-specific
prompting and a recursive verification process, ADPT transforms raw visual data
into high-quality, semantically labeled defect datasets without any manual
supervision. Experimental results demonstrate that ADPT achieves up to 98%
accuracy in distinguishing defective from non-defective images, and 85%-98%
annotation accuracy across four defect categories under class-balanced
settings, with 80%-92% accuracy on class-imbalanced datasets. The framework
offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for high-fidelity dataset
construction, providing strong support for downstream tasks such as transfer
learning and domain adaptation in structural damage assessment.

TL;DR: 提出COFA策略，通过前景和背景特征增强来提升视觉语言导航的泛化能力，在REVERIE和R2R数据集上达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言导航中前景和背景的重要性未被充分探索，前景提供语义线索，背景包含空间连接信息

Method: 使用语义增强的地标识别分离前景和背景特征，通过共识驱动的在线增强策略整合两阶段投票结果

Result: 在REVERIE和R2R数据集上提升了基线模型的泛化能力并达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 前景-背景在线特征增强策略能有效提升视觉语言导航的泛化性能

Abstract: Following language instructions, vision-language navigation (VLN) agents are
tasked with navigating unseen environments. While augmenting multifaceted
visual representations has propelled advancements in VLN, the significance of
foreground and background in visual observations remains underexplored.
Intuitively, foreground regions provide semantic cues, whereas the background
encompasses spatial connectivity information. Inspired on this insight, we
propose a Consensus-driven Online Feature Augmentation strategy (COFA) with
alternative foreground and background features to facilitate the navigable
generalization. Specifically, we first leverage semantically-enhanced landmark
identification to disentangle foreground and background as candidate augmented
features. Subsequently, a consensus-driven online augmentation strategy
encourages the agent to consolidate two-stage voting results on feature
preferences according to diverse instructions and navigational locations.
Experiments on REVERIE and R2R demonstrate that our online
foreground-background augmentation boosts the generalization of baseline and
attains state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了RCOR方法，通过将定位作为识别的组成部分，实现对象中心和上下文感知的建模分离，然后进行鲁棒的非参数融合，在保持上下文信息的同时提高模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准监督学习会导致模型过度依赖背景信息（捷径学习），限制了模型在真实部署环境中的鲁棒性。现有方法主要通过抑制背景来解决问题，但牺牲了上下文信息。

Method: RCOR将定位作为识别的组成部分，分离对象中心和上下文感知建模，然后进行鲁棒的非参数融合。

Result: RCOR提高了监督模型和VLM在域内和域外背景数据集上的性能，即使不进行微调。在复杂场景（如ImageNet-1k）中实现了定位先于识别。

Conclusion: RCOR是首个同时实现鲁棒性和上下文感知的方法，无需在两者之间妥协，证明了在复杂场景中定位先于识别的可行性。

Abstract: In visual recognition, both the object of interest (referred to as
foreground, FG, for simplicity) and its surrounding context (background, BG)
play an important role. However, standard supervised learning often leads to
unintended over-reliance on the BG, known as shortcut learning of spurious
correlations, limiting model robustness in real-world deployment settings. In
the literature, the problem is mainly addressed by suppressing the BG,
sacrificing context information for improved generalization.
  We propose RCOR -- Robust Context-Aware Object Recognition -- the first
approach that jointly achieves robustness and context-awareness without
compromising either. RCOR treats localization as an integral part of
recognition to decouple object-centric and context-aware modelling, followed by
a robust, non-parametric fusion. It improves the performance of both supervised
models and VLM on datasets with both in-domain and out-of-domain BG, even
without fine-tuning. The results confirm that localization before recognition
is now possible even in complex scenes as in ImageNet-1k.

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用无条件判别器(UCD)来解决GAN训练中的纳什均衡问题，通过移除判别器中的条件输入来促进更好的特征提取和训练收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗训练是单步生成的关键，但GAN训练在实践中难以正确收敛且存在模式崩溃问题。研究发现判别器中的条件输入造成了冗余捷径，阻碍了有意义的特征提取。

Method: 提出无条件判别器(UCD)，强制判别器在没有条件注入的情况下提取更全面和鲁棒的特征，从而为生成器提供更好的监督，促进纳什均衡。

Result: 在ImageNet-64数据集上取得了1.47 FID的优异结果，超越了StyleGAN-XL和多个最先进的单步扩散模型，证明了方法的显著性能提升和高效率。

Conclusion: UCD方法在理论上与原始GAN理论兼容，可以以插件方式实现，实验证实了其在提升GAN训练性能和促进纳什均衡方面的有效性。

Abstract: Adversarial training turns out to be the key to one-step generation,
especially for Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and diffusion model
distillation. Yet in practice, GAN training hardly converges properly and
struggles in mode collapse. In this work, we quantitatively analyze the extent
of Nash equilibrium in GAN training, and conclude that redundant shortcuts by
inputting condition in $D$ disables meaningful knowledge extraction. We thereby
propose to employ an unconditional discriminator (UCD), in which $D$ is
enforced to extract more comprehensive and robust features with no condition
injection. In this way, $D$ is able to leverage better knowledge to supervise
$G$, which promotes Nash equilibrium in GAN literature. Theoretical guarantee
on compatibility with vanilla GAN theory indicates that UCD can be implemented
in a plug-in manner. Extensive experiments confirm the significant performance
improvements with high efficiency. For instance, we achieved \textbf{1.47 FID}
on the ImageNet-64 dataset, surpassing StyleGAN-XL and several state-of-the-art
one-step diffusion models. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Fashion image generation has so far focused on narrow tasks such as virtual
try-on, where garments appear in clean studio environments. In contrast,
editorial fashion presents garments through dynamic poses, diverse locations,
and carefully crafted visual narratives. We introduce the task of virtual
fashion photo-shoot, which seeks to capture this richness by transforming
standardized garment images into contextually grounded editorial imagery. To
enable this new direction, we construct the first large-scale dataset of
garment-lookbook pairs, bridging the gap between e-commerce and fashion media.
Because such pairs are not readily available, we design an automated retrieval
pipeline that aligns garments across domains, combining visual-language
reasoning with object-level localization. We construct a dataset with three
garment-lookbook pair accuracy levels: high quality (10,000 pairs), medium
quality (50,000 pairs), and low quality (300,000 pairs). This dataset offers a
foundation for models that move beyond catalog-style generation and toward
fashion imagery that reflects creativity, atmosphere, and storytelling.

Result: 在多个公共数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法取得了优越的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合了几何先验和网络学习过程，为深度伪造检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid development of deepfake generation techniques necessitates robust
face forgery detection algorithms. While methods based on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformers are effective, there is still room for
improvement in modeling the highly complex and non-linear nature of forgery
artifacts. To address this issue, we propose a novel detection method based on
the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). By replacing fixed activation functions
with learnable splines, our KAN-based approach is better suited to this
challenge. Furthermore, to guide the network's focus towards critical facial
areas, we introduce a Landmark-assisted Adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Network
(LAKAN) module. This module uses facial landmarks as a structural prior to
dynamically generate the internal parameters of the KAN, creating an
instance-specific signal that steers a general-purpose image encoder towards
the most informative facial regions with artifacts. This core innovation
creates a powerful combination between geometric priors and the network's
learning process. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that
our proposed method achieves superior performance.

Result: 大量实验证明该方法在评估整流流变换器中概念擦除策略鲁棒性方面有效且高效。

Conclusion: ReFlux为评估整流流变换器中概念擦除策略的鲁棒性建立了可靠基准。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled
impressive generative capabilities, but they also raise significant safety
concerns due to the potential to produce harmful or undesirable content. While
concept erasure has been explored as a mitigation strategy, most existing
approaches and corresponding attack evaluations are tailored to Stable
Diffusion (SD) and exhibit limited effectiveness when transferred to
next-generation rectified flow transformers such as Flux. In this work, we
present ReFlux, the first concept attack method specifically designed to assess
the robustness of concept erasure in the latest rectified flow-based T2I
framework. Our approach is motivated by the observation that existing concept
erasure techniques, when applied to Flux, fundamentally rely on a phenomenon
known as attention localization. Building on this insight, we propose a simple
yet effective attack strategy that specifically targets this property. At its
core, a reverse-attention optimization strategy is introduced to effectively
reactivate suppressed signals while stabilizing attention. This is further
reinforced by a velocity-guided dynamic that enhances the robustness of concept
reactivation by steering the flow matching process, and a
consistency-preserving objective that maintains the global layout and preserves
unrelated content. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed attack method, establishing a
reliable benchmark for evaluating the robustness of concept erasure strategies
in rectified flow transformers.

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles is becoming more common to offer a
more robust alternative for several perception tasks. This need arises from the
unique contribution of each sensor in collecting data: camera-radar fusion
offers a cost-effective solution by combining rich semantic information from
cameras with accurate distance measurements from radar, without incurring
excessive financial costs or overwhelming data processing requirements. Map
segmentation is a critical task for enabling effective vehicle behaviour in its
environment, yet it continues to face significant challenges in achieving high
accuracy and meeting real-time performance requirements. Therefore, this work
presents a novel and efficient map segmentation architecture, using cameras and
radars, in the \acrfull{bev} space. Our model introduces a real-time map
segmentation architecture considering aspects such as high accuracy, per-class
balancing, and inference time. To accomplish this, we use an advanced loss set
together with a new lightweight head to improve the perception results. Our
results show that, with these modifications, our approach achieves results
comparable to large models, reaching 53.5 mIoU, while also setting a new
benchmark for inference time, improving it by 260\% over the strongest baseline
models.

Conclusion: SpecMCD方法在不同云覆盖条件下具有优越性和潜力，能够有效提高云检测精度。

Abstract: Clouds significantly affect the quality of optical satellite images, which
seriously limits their precise application. Recently, deep learning has been
widely applied to cloud detection and has achieved satisfactory results.
However, the lack of distinctive features in thin clouds and the low quality of
training samples limit the cloud detection accuracy of deep learning methods,
leaving space for further improvements. In this paper, we propose a weakly
supervised cloud detection method that combines spectral features and
multi-scale scene-level deep network (SpecMCD) to obtain highly accurate
pixel-level cloud masks. The method first utilizes a progressive training
framework with a multi-scale scene-level dataset to train the multi-scale
scene-level cloud detection network. Pixel-level cloud probability maps are
then obtained by combining the multi-scale probability maps and cloud thickness
map based on the characteristics of clouds in dense cloud coverage and large
cloud-area coverage images. Finally, adaptive thresholds are generated based on
the differentiated regions of the scene-level cloud masks at different scales
and combined with distance-weighted optimization to obtain binary cloud masks.
Two datasets, WDCD and GF1MS-WHU, comprising a total of 60 Gaofen-1
multispectral (GF1-MS) images, were used to verify the effectiveness of the
proposed method. Compared to the other weakly supervised cloud detection
methods such as WDCD and WSFNet, the F1-score of the proposed SpecMCD method
shows an improvement of over 7.82%, highlighting the superiority and potential
of the SpecMCD method for cloud detection under different cloud coverage
conditions.

Motivation: 一致性模型(CMs)虽然能实现一步或两步采样，但需要长时间训练和大批量大小才能获得有竞争力的样本质量。研究发现CM训练收敛时切线方向存在振荡问题，平行于数据流形而非指向流形

Method: 提出流形特征距离(MFD)损失函数，提供流形对齐的切线方向，使切线指向数据流形。该方法称为Align Your Tangent (AYT)

Result: AYT方法能加速CM训练数个数量级，甚至超越LPIPS指标。还能在极小批量大小下训练而不损害样本质量

Conclusion: 通过解决切线振荡问题，AYT方法显著提升了一致性模型的训练效率和样本质量

Abstract: With diffusion and flow matching models achieving state-of-the-art generating
performance, the interest of the community now turned to reducing the inference
time without sacrificing sample quality. Consistency Models (CMs), which are
trained to be consistent on diffusion or probability flow ordinary differential
equation (PF-ODE) trajectories, enable one or two-step flow or diffusion
sampling. However, CMs typically require prolonged training with large batch
sizes to obtain competitive sample quality. In this paper, we examine the
training dynamics of CMs near convergence and discover that CM tangents -- CM
output update directions -- are quite oscillatory, in the sense that they move
parallel to the data manifold, not towards the manifold. To mitigate
oscillatory tangents, we propose a new loss function, called the manifold
feature distance (MFD), which provides manifold-aligned tangents that point
toward the data manifold. Consequently, our method -- dubbed Align Your Tangent
(AYT) -- can accelerate CM training by orders of magnitude and even out-perform
the learned perceptual image patch similarity metric (LPIPS). Furthermore, we
find that our loss enables training with extremely small batch sizes without
compromising sample quality. Code: https://github.com/1202kbs/AYT

Abstract: High-sensitivity clutter filtering is a fundamental step in ultrasound
microvascular imaging. Singular value decomposition (SVD) and robust principal
component analysis (rPCA) are the main clutter filtering strategies. However,
both strategies are limited in feature modeling and tissue-blood flow
separation for high-quality microvascular imaging. Recently, deep
learning-based clutter filtering has shown potential in more thoroughly
separating tissue and blood flow signals. However, the existing supervised
filters face the challenges of interpretability and lack of in-vitro and
in-vivo ground truths. While the interpretability issue can be addressed by
algorithm deep unfolding, the training ground truth remains unsolved. To this
end, this paper proposes an unsupervised unfolded rPCA (U2-rPCA) method that
preserves mathematical interpretability and is insusceptible to learning
labels. Specifically, U2-rPCA is unfolded from an iteratively reweighted least
squares (IRLS) rPCA baseline with intrinsic low-rank and sparse regularization.
A sparse-enhancement unit is added to the network to strengthen its capability
to capture the sparse micro-flow signals. U2-rPCA is like an adaptive filter
that is trained with part of the image sequence and then used for the following
frames. Experimental validations on a in-silico dataset and public in-vivo
datasets demonstrated the outperformance of U2-rPCA when compared with the
SVD-based method, the rPCA baseline, and another deep learning-based filter.
Particularly, the proposed method improved the contrastto-noise ratio (CNR) of
the power Doppler image by 2 dB to 10 dB when compared with other methods.
Furthermore, the effectiveness of the building modules of U2-rPCA was validated
through ablation studies.

Conclusion: 结果突显了框架的鲁棒性和多功能性，展示了域适应方法在多种场景下准确执行脑血管图像分割的潜力。

Abstract: The intricate morphology of brain vessels poses significant challenges for
automatic segmentation models, which usually focus on a single imaging
modality. However, accurately treating brain-related conditions requires a
comprehensive understanding of the cerebrovascular tree, regardless of the
specific acquisition procedure. Our framework effectively segments brain
arteries and veins in various datasets through image-to-image translation while
avoiding domain-specific model design and data harmonization between the source
and the target domain. This is accomplished by employing disentanglement
techniques to independently manipulate different image properties, allowing
them to move from one domain to another in a label-preserving manner.
Specifically, we focus on manipulating vessel appearances during adaptation
while preserving spatial information, such as shapes and locations, which are
crucial for correct segmentation. Our evaluation effectively bridges large and
varied domain gaps across medical centers, image modalities, and vessel types.
Additionally, we conduct ablation studies on the optimal number of required
annotations and other architectural choices. The results highlight our
framework's robustness and versatility, demonstrating the potential of domain
adaptation methodologies to perform cerebrovascular image segmentation in
multiple scenarios accurately. Our code is available at

Method: 提出了几何框架和基于核的概率方法，将扩散模型解释为向图像流形的投影机制，构建了确定性模型MPPM，可在表示空间和潜在空间中操作。

Result: 潜在MPPM（LMPPM）在各种数据集上优于潜在扩散模型（LDM），在图像恢复和生成方面取得了更优越的结果。

Conclusion: 该研究成功统一了几何和概率视角，为扩散模型提供了新的几何解释框架，并证明了基于该框架的MPPM模型在图像生成任务中的优越性能。

Abstract: The foundational premise of generative AI for images is the assumption that
images are inherently low-dimensional objects embedded within a
high-dimensional space. Additionally, it is often implicitly assumed that
thematic image datasets form smooth or piecewise smooth manifolds. Common
approaches overlook the geometric structure and focus solely on probabilistic
methods, approximating the probability distribution through universal
approximation techniques such as the kernel method. In some generative models,
the low dimensional nature of the data manifest itself by the introduction of a
lower dimensional latent space. Yet, the probability distribution in the latent
or the manifold coordinate space is considered uninteresting and is predefined
or considered uniform. This study unifies the geometric and probabilistic
perspectives by providing a geometric framework and a kernel-based
probabilistic method simultaneously. The resulting framework demystifies
diffusion models by interpreting them as a projection mechanism onto the
manifold of ``good images''. This interpretation leads to the construction of a
new deterministic model, the Manifold-Probabilistic Projection Model (MPPM),
which operates in both the representation (pixel) space and the latent space.
We demonstrate that the Latent MPPM (LMPPM) outperforms the Latent Diffusion
Model (LDM) across various datasets, achieving superior results in terms of
image restoration and generation.

*Aaron Kujawa,Thomas Booth,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出使用二进制编码替代one-hot编码来降低医学图像多类别分割的计算和内存需求，但发现这些方法在保持最先进分割性能方面面临挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准基于学习的方法使用one-hot编码，计算复杂度和内存需求随类别数线性增长。本文旨在通过二进制编码方法将这些需求降低到对数级别，特别针对108个类别的全脑分割任务。

Method: 研究了一系列二进制编码方法，包括普通二进制编码、纠错输出码(ECOC)、类别加权、硬/软解码、类别到码字分配以及标签嵌入树。

Result: 与one-hot编码(DSC=82.4)相比，二进制分割方法的性能显著降低，DSC范围在39.3到73.8之间，未能达到最先进的分割质量。

Conclusion: 虽然二进制编码在计算机视觉的极端分类问题中证明有效，但在大规模多类别分割任务中实现紧凑编码策略仍面临挑战，希望此工作能激发未来研究。

Abstract: This work presents novel methods to reduce computational and memory
requirements for medical image segmentation with a large number of classes. We
curiously observe challenges in maintaining state-of-the-art segmentation
performance with all of the explored options. Standard learning-based methods
typically employ one-hot encoding of class labels. The computational complexity
and memory requirements thus increase linearly with the number of classes. We
propose a family of binary encoding approaches instead of one-hot encoding to
reduce the computational complexity and memory requirements to logarithmic in
the number of classes. In addition to vanilla binary encoding, we investigate
the effects of error-correcting output codes (ECOCs), class weighting,
hard/soft decoding, class-to-codeword assignment, and label embedding trees. We
apply the methods to the use case of whole brain parcellation with 108 classes
based on 3D MRI images. While binary encodings have proven efficient in
so-called extreme classification problems in computer vision, we faced
challenges in reaching state-of-the-art segmentation quality with binary
encodings. Compared to one-hot encoding (Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) =
82.4 (2.8)), we report reduced segmentation performance with the binary
segmentation approaches, achieving DSCs in the range from 39.3 to 73.8.
Informative negative results all too often go unpublished. We hope that this
work inspires future research of compact encoding strategies for large
multi-class segmentation tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种事件-图像知识蒸馏框架，利用CLIP的语义理解能力实现事件数据的开放词汇目标检测，通过空间注意力蒸馏和混合SNN-CNN框架解决事件数据模态差异和时序信息丢失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机在目标检测中具有高速响应、低延迟和抗运动模糊等优势，但缺乏纹理和颜色信息，使得开放词汇检测面临挑战。现有事件检测方法通常局限于预定义类别，难以泛化到新物体。

Method: 使用图像帧作为教师模型输入，通过空间注意力蒸馏引导事件学生模型学习CLIP的视觉表示；设计混合SNN-CNN框架，SNN自适应确定最佳事件分割时刻，CNN处理提取的特征进行目标检测。

Result: 该方法成功将CLIP的视觉知识迁移到事件数据，实现了事件数据的开放词汇目标检测，避免了直接训练CLIP在事件流上的困难。

Conclusion: 提出的知识蒸馏框架有效弥合了图像和事件数据之间的模态差距，混合SNN-CNN设计保留了关键时序信息，为事件相机的开放词汇检测提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Event cameras offer advantages in object detection tasks due to high-speed
response, low latency, and robustness to motion blur. However, event cameras
lack texture and color information, making open-vocabulary detection
particularly challenging. Current event-based detection methods are typically
trained on predefined categories, limiting their ability to generalize to novel
objects, where encountering previously unseen objects is common.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary object detection in
RGB images. However, the modality gap between images and event streams makes it
ineffective to directly transfer CLIP to event data, as CLIP was not designed
for event streams. To bridge this gap, we propose an event-image knowledge
distillation framework that leverages CLIP's semantic understanding to achieve
open-vocabulary object detection on event data. Instead of training CLIP
directly on event streams, we use image frames as inputs to a teacher model,
guiding the event-based student model to learn CLIP's rich visual
representations. Through spatial attention-based distillation, the student
network learns meaningful visual features directly from raw event inputs while
inheriting CLIP's broad visual knowledge. Furthermore, to prevent information
loss due to event data segmentation, we design a hybrid spiking neural network
(SNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) framework. Unlike fixed-group
event segmentation methods, which often discard crucial temporal information,
our SNN adaptively determines the optimal event segmentation moments, ensuring
that key temporal features are extracted. The extracted event features are then
processed by CNNs for object detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于原型的方法通常依赖额外的后处理显著技术来解释学习到的原型语义，但这些技术的可靠性和质量受到质疑，因此研究使用图像分割基础模型来改进嵌入空间和输入空间映射的真实性。

Method: 使用图像分割模型生成分割掩码，利用每个掩码的边界框裁剪图像，每个掩码作为ProtoMask新模型架构的独立输入，将显著图计算限制在预定义的语义图像块中。

Conclusion: ProtoMask模型通过结合图像分割基础模型，有效提高了原型映射的真实性，在保持竞争性能的同时提供了更好的可解释性特征。

Abstract: XAI gained considerable importance in recent years. Methods based on
prototypical case-based reasoning have shown a promising improvement in
explainability. However, these methods typically rely on additional post-hoc
saliency techniques to explain the semantics of learned prototypes. Multiple
critiques have been raised about the reliability and quality of such
techniques. For this reason, we study the use of prominent image segmentation
foundation models to improve the truthfulness of the mapping between embedding
and input space. We aim to restrict the computation area of the saliency map to
a predefined semantic image patch to reduce the uncertainty of such
visualizations. To perceive the information of an entire image, we use the
bounding box from each generated segmentation mask to crop the image. Each mask
results in an individual input in our novel model architecture named ProtoMask.
We conduct experiments on three popular fine-grained classification datasets
with a wide set of metrics, providing a detailed overview on explainability
characteristics. The comparison with other popular models demonstrates
competitive performance and unique explainability features of our model.

TL;DR: MoE-SGT是一个增强概念瓶颈模型的多模态推理框架，通过图变换器和专家混合模块显式建模概念间结构化关系，提升复杂概念推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统概念瓶颈模型存在单模态局限且忽略概念间结构化关系，无法有效处理复杂概念推理任务。

Method: 构建答案-概念和答案-问题图，集成图变换器捕获多层次依赖，并用专家混合模块替代前馈层实现动态专家分配。

Result: 在多个数据集上比其他概念瓶颈网络获得更高准确率。

Conclusion: MoE-SGT通过建模概念结构化关系和动态专家选择机制，显著提升了概念推理的适应性和准确性。

Abstract: With growing demand for interpretability in deep learning, especially in high
stakes domains, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) address this by inserting
human understandable concepts into the prediction pipeline, but they are
generally single modal and ignore structured concept relationships. To overcome
these limitations, we present MoE-SGT, a reasoning driven framework that
augments CBMs with a structure injecting Graph Transformer and a Mixture of
Experts (MoE) module. We construct answer-concept and answer-question graphs
for multimodal inputs to explicitly model the structured relationships among
concepts. Subsequently, we integrate Graph Transformer to capture multi level
dependencies, addressing the limitations of traditional Concept Bottleneck
Models in modeling concept interactions. However, it still encounters
bottlenecks in adapting to complex concept patterns. Therefore, we replace the
feed forward layers with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) module, enabling the model
to have greater capacity in learning diverse concept relationships while
dynamically allocating reasoning tasks to different sub experts, thereby
significantly enhancing the model's adaptability to complex concept reasoning.
MoE-SGT achieves higher accuracy than other concept bottleneck networks on
multiple datasets by modeling structured relationships among concepts and
utilizing a dynamic expert selection mechanism.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的多模态大语言模型框架，利用模型内在不确定性作为指导信号，通过响应熵值评分候选视觉输入，使模型能自主关注最显著的数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在细粒度感知任务（如高分辨率图像中的小物体识别、长视频中的关键时刻定位）上表现不佳，现有方法依赖复杂、任务特定的微调，限制了泛化能力并增加了模型复杂度。

Method: 利用MLLM的内在不确定性作为主动指导信号，核心洞察是当呈现相关视觉信息时模型的输出熵会降低。引入统一机制，通过响应不确定性对候选视觉输入进行评分，使模型能自主聚焦于最显著的数据。

Result: 在三个复杂视觉任务（视觉搜索、长视频理解、时间定位）上应用该简单原则，使现成的MLLM能够达到与专门微调方法相竞争的性能。

Conclusion: 验证了利用内在不确定性是增强细粒度多模态性能的强大通用策略，无需额外训练即可显著提升模型在复杂视觉任务上的表现。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often struggle with fine-grained
perception, such as identifying small objects in high-resolution images or
finding key moments in long videos. Existing works typically rely on
complicated, task-specific fine-tuning, which limits their generalizability and
increases model complexity. In this work, we propose an effective,
training-free framework that uses an MLLM's intrinsic uncertainty as a
proactive guidance signal. Our core insight is that a model's output entropy
decreases when presented with relevant visual information. We introduce a
unified mechanism that scores candidate visual inputs by response uncertainty,
enabling the model to autonomously focus on the most salient data. We apply
this simple principle to three complex visual tasks: Visual Search, Long Video
Understanding, and Temporal Grounding, allowing off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve
performance competitive with specialized, fine-tuned methods. Our work
validates that harnessing intrinsic uncertainty is a powerful, general strategy
for enhancing fine-grained multimodal performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于配准的运动校正方法速度慢且对采集变异性敏感，限制了定量灌注成像的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Method: 使用无监督深度学习管道，通过三步运动校正和鲁棒主成分分析减少对比度相关影响，对齐灌注序列和辅助图像（动脉输入函数和质子密度加权序列）。

Result: 深度学习方法显著改善了时间-强度曲线的时间平滑性，心肌对齐效果与基线相当但优于未配准状态，灌注图显示运动减少，处理时间减少了15倍。

Conclusion: 该深度学习管道能够实现快速、鲁棒的运动校正，提高了动态和辅助图像的准确性，在多厂商数据上训练，能够跨序列泛化，有助于推动定量灌注成像的临床采用。

Abstract: Background: Quantitative stress perfusion cardiovascular magnetic resonance
(CMR) is a powerful tool for assessing myocardial ischemia. Motion correction
is essential for accurate pixel-wise mapping but traditional registration-based
methods are slow and sensitive to acquisition variability, limiting robustness
and scalability.
  Methods: We developed an unsupervised deep learning-based motion correction
pipeline that replaces iterative registration with efficient one-shot
estimation. The method corrects motion in three steps and uses robust principal
component analysis to reduce contrast-related effects. It aligns the perfusion
series and auxiliary images (arterial input function and proton
density-weighted series). Models were trained and validated on multivendor data
from 201 patients, with 38 held out for testing. Performance was assessed via
temporal alignment and quantitative perfusion values, compared to a previously
published registration-based method.
  Results: The deep learning approach significantly improved temporal
smoothness of time-intensity curves (p<0.001). Myocardial alignment (Dice =
0.92 (0.04) and 0.91 (0.05)) was comparable to the baseline and superior to
before registration (Dice = 0.80 (0.09), p<0.001). Perfusion maps showed
reduced motion, with lower standard deviation in the myocardium (0.52 (0.39)
ml/min/g) compared to baseline (0.55 (0.44) ml/min/g). Processing time was
reduced 15-fold.
  Conclusion: This deep learning pipeline enables fast, robust motion
correction for stress perfusion CMR, improving accuracy across dynamic and
auxiliary images. Trained on multivendor data, it generalizes across sequences
and may facilitate broader clinical adoption of quantitative perfusion imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统情绪识别方法存在主观性和模糊性问题，EEG提供更直接客观的数据源，但全EEG测量复杂昂贵，需要探索低成本EEG设备的可行性。

Method: 使用DEAP数据集，通过连续小波变换将EEG数据转换为尺度图，训练视觉变换器模型进行情绪分类，比较不同通道数量的性能。

Result: 仅使用12个通道即可达到91.57%的准确率预测4个情绪象限（高低唤醒度和效价），接近32个通道96.9%的最先进结果。

Conclusion: 显著减少EEG输入通道数量仍能获得高精度情绪预测结果，为低成本EEG设备在情绪识别应用中的可行性提供了有力证据。

Abstract: Accurately predicting emotions from brain signals has the potential to
achieve goals such as improving mental health, human-computer interaction, and
affective computing. Emotion prediction through neural signals offers a
promising alternative to traditional methods, such as self-assessment and
facial expression analysis, which can be subjective or ambiguous. Measurements
of the brain activity via electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a more direct and
unbiased data source. However, conducting a full EEG is a complex,
resource-intensive process, leading to the rise of low-cost EEG devices with
simplified measurement capabilities. This work examines how subsets of EEG
channels from the DEAP dataset can be used for sufficiently accurate emotion
prediction with low-cost EEG devices, rather than fully equipped
EEG-measurements. Using Continuous Wavelet Transformation to convert EEG data
into scaleograms, we trained a vision transformer (ViT) model for emotion
classification. The model achieved over 91,57% accuracy in predicting 4
quadrants (high/low per arousal and valence) with only 12 measuring points
(also referred to as channels). Our work shows clearly, that a significant
reduction of input channels yields high results compared to state-of-the-art
results of 96,9% with 32 channels. Training scripts to reproduce our code can

<details>

Motivation: 现有盲图像恢复方法在面临极端退化(超出训练范围)时表现不佳，直接学习ELQ到HQ映射因域差距过大导致不自然伪影和细节丢失。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1)学习投影器将ELQ图像映射到中间LQ流形；2)使用冻结的现成BIR模型恢复至HQ。基于信息论视角，将图像恢复视为信息瓶颈问题，推导理论驱动目标函数训练投影器。

Result: 在严重退化场景下的广泛实验证明了方法的有效性，支持推理时提示优化和即插即用增强现有模型。

Conclusion: 该框架通过分解恢复过程解决了EBIR问题，提供了理论驱动的训练目标，能够稳定训练并有效处理极端退化情况。

Abstract: Blind Image Restoration (BIR) methods have achieved remarkable success but
falter when faced with Extreme Blind Image Restoration (EBIR), where inputs
suffer from severe, compounded degradations beyond their training scope.
Directly learning a mapping from extremely low-quality (ELQ) to high-quality
(HQ) images is challenging due to the massive domain gap, often leading to
unnatural artifacts and loss of detail. To address this, we propose a novel
framework that decomposes the intractable ELQ-to-HQ restoration process. We
first learn a projector that maps an ELQ image onto an intermediate,
less-degraded LQ manifold. This intermediate image is then restored to HQ using
a frozen, off-the-shelf BIR model. Our approach is grounded in information
theory; we provide a novel perspective of image restoration as an Information
Bottleneck problem and derive a theoretically-driven objective to train our
projector. This loss function effectively stabilizes training by balancing a
low-quality reconstruction term with a high-quality prior-matching term. Our
framework enables Look Forward Once (LFO) for inference-time prompt refinement,
and supports plug-and-play strengthening of existing image restoration models
without need for finetuning. Extensive experiments under severe degradation
regimes provide a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of our work.

Abstract: Non-destructive testing (NDT) is essential in ceramic manufacturing to ensure
the quality of components without compromising their integrity. In this
context, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables high-resolution internal
imaging, revealing defects such as pores, delaminations, or inclusions. This
paper presents an automatic defect detection system based on Deep Learning
(DL), trained on OCT images with manually segmented annotations. A neural
network based on the U-Net architecture is developed, evaluating multiple
experimental configurations to enhance its performance. Post-processing
techniques enable both quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the
predictions. The system shows an accurate behavior of 0.979 Dice Score,
outperforming comparable studies. The inference time of 18.98 seconds per

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏能够同时满足与人类判断对齐、长序列处理、推理效率和多目标评分适用性的综合基准和评估预测器，这阻碍了可靠视觉语言应用的发展。

Method: 采用即插即用架构，在大型视觉语言模型上构建奖励头，通过训练轻量级岭回归层来生成细粒度的多目标评分。

Result: MULTI-TAP在不同LVLM架构上表现稳健，性能显著优于现有指标，甚至与GPT-4o基预测器G-VEval相当，但模型规模更小（7-8B）。在性能和效率上均优于VisionREWARD。

Conclusion: MULTI-TAP提供了一个强大的图像-文本对齐评估工具，新发布的EYE4ALL数据集为开发更易访问的AI系统奠定了基础，特别是考虑了盲人和低视力用户的需求。

Abstract: Evaluating image-text alignment while reflecting human preferences across
multiple aspects is a significant issue for the development of reliable
vision-language applications. It becomes especially crucial in real-world
scenarios where multiple valid descriptions exist depending on contexts or user
needs. However, research progress is hindered by the lack of comprehensive
benchmarks and existing evaluation predictors lacking at least one of these key
properties: (1) Alignment with human judgments, (2) Long-sequence processing,
(3) Inference efficiency, and (4) Applicability to multi-objective scoring. To
address these challenges, we propose a plug-and-play architecture to build a
robust predictor, MULTI-TAP (Multi-Objective Task-Aware Predictor), capable of
both multi and single-objective scoring. MULTI-TAP can produce a single overall
score, utilizing a reward head built on top of a large vision-language model
(LVLMs). We show that MULTI-TAP is robust in terms of application to different
LVLM architectures, achieving significantly higher performance than existing
metrics and even on par with the GPT-4o-based predictor, G-VEval, with a
smaller size (7-8B). By training a lightweight ridge regression layer on the
frozen hidden states of a pre-trained LVLM, MULTI-TAP can produce fine-grained
scores for multiple human-interpretable objectives. MULTI-TAP performs better
than VisionREWARD, a high-performing multi-objective reward model, in both
performance and efficiency on multi-objective benchmarks and our newly released
text-image-to-text dataset, EYE4ALL. Our new dataset, consisting of
chosen/rejected human preferences (EYE4ALLPref) and human-annotated
fine-grained scores across seven dimensions (EYE4ALLMulti), can serve as a
foundation for developing more accessible AI systems by capturing the
underlying preferences of users, including blind and low-vision (BLV)
individuals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒对抗攻击方法需要多次查询或训练扩散模型来生成对抗样本，这限制了它们在现实场景中的应用。

Method: 使用深度神经网络的特征图，将其添加到干净图像中，以破坏目标模型的分类性能，实现单次查询攻击。

Result: ZQBA能够在不同模型和数据集（CIFAR和Tiny ImageNet）间成功迁移对抗样本，在单次查询下比现有最先进的黑盒攻击更有效，同时保持扰动的不可感知性。

Conclusion: ZQBA方法揭示了深度神经网络在现实世界应用中的脆弱性，为开发更安全的AI系统提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Current black-box adversarial attacks either require multiple queries or
diffusion models to produce adversarial samples that can impair the target
model performance. However, these methods require training a surrogate loss or
diffusion models to produce adversarial samples, which limits their
applicability in real-world settings. Thus, we propose a Zero Query Black-box
Adversarial (ZQBA) attack that exploits the representations of Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) to fool other networks. Instead of requiring thousands of
queries to produce deceiving adversarial samples, we use the feature maps
obtained from a DNN and add them to clean images to impair the classification
of a target model. The results suggest that ZQBA can transfer the adversarial
samples to different models and across various datasets, namely CIFAR and Tiny
ImageNet. The experiments also show that ZQBA is more effective than
state-of-the-art black-box attacks with a single query, while maintaining the
imperceptibility of perturbations, evaluated both quantitatively (SSIM) and
qualitatively, emphasizing the vulnerabilities of employing DNNs in real-world
contexts. All the source code is available at

Method: 学习一组二元类别级概念原型，使用预测概念向量与每个类别原型之间的距离作为分类分数和不确定性度量，这些原型也作为可解释的分类规则。

Result: 该框架通过基于学习到的二元类别级概念原型的偏差，为不确定或异常输入启用符合性预测，从而增强可解释性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在概念瓶颈模型的第二阶段实现了不确定性感知和可解释性，通过学习概念原型同时提升了分类性能和模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: In the context of image classification, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)
first embed images into a set of human-understandable concepts, followed by an
intrinsically interpretable classifier that predicts labels based on these
intermediate representations. While CBMs offer a semantically meaningful and
interpretable classification pipeline, they often sacrifice predictive
performance compared to end-to-end convolutional neural networks. Moreover, the
propagation of uncertainty from concept predictions to final label decisions
remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware and
interpretable classifier for the second stage of CBMs. Our method learns a set
of binary class-level concept prototypes and uses the distances between
predicted concept vectors and each class prototype as both a classification
score and a measure of uncertainty. These prototypes also serve as
interpretable classification rules, indicating which concepts should be present
in an image to justify a specific class prediction. The proposed framework
enhances both interpretability and robustness by enabling conformal prediction
for uncertain or outlier inputs based on their deviation from the learned
binary class-level concept prototypes.

TL;DR: MetaLogic是一个无需真实图像就能检测文本到图像模型语义不一致性的评估框架，通过生成语法不同但语义相同的提示词对来识别模型的对齐失败问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像模型在输入提示词发生微小语言变化时难以保持语义一致性，即使这些提示词在逻辑上是等价的，这暴露了模型在推理和泛化方面的鲁棒性不足。

Method: 利用蜕变测试方法，生成语法不同但语义相同的提示词对，通过直接比较这些提示词生成的图像对来识别不一致性，从而诊断模型逻辑理解的鲁棒性问题。

Result: 在多个最先进的文本到图像模型上评估发现，即使是Flux.dev和DALLE-3这样的SOTA模型也分别有59%和71%的对齐失败率，揭示了模型在逻辑一致性方面的显著问题。

Conclusion: MetaLogic提供了一种可扩展、无需真实图像的评估方法，能有效发现现有评估指标忽略的细粒度逻辑不一致问题，可用于模型调试和改进。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models, especially diffusion-based
architectures, have significantly improved the visual quality of generated
images. However, these models continue to struggle with a critical limitation:
maintaining semantic consistency when input prompts undergo minor linguistic
variations. Despite being logically equivalent, such prompt pairs often yield
misaligned or semantically inconsistent images, exposing a lack of robustness
in reasoning and generalisation. To address this, we propose MetaLogic, a novel
evaluation framework that detects T2I misalignment without relying on ground
truth images. MetaLogic leverages metamorphic testing, generating image pairs
from prompts that differ grammatically but are semantically identical. By
directly comparing these image pairs, the framework identifies inconsistencies
that signal failures in preserving the intended meaning, effectively diagnosing
robustness issues in the model's logic understanding. Unlike existing
evaluation methods that compare a generated image to a single prompt, MetaLogic
evaluates semantic equivalence between paired images, offering a scalable,
ground-truth-free approach to identifying alignment failures. It categorises
these alignment errors (e.g., entity omission, duplication, positional
misalignment) and surfaces counterexamples that can be used for model debugging
and refinement. We evaluate MetaLogic across multiple state-of-the-art T2I
models and reveal consistent robustness failures across a range of logical
constructs. We find that even the SOTA text-to-image models like Flux.dev and
DALLE-3 demonstrate a 59 percent and 71 percent misalignment rate,
respectively. Our results show that MetaLogic is not only efficient and
scalable, but also effective in uncovering fine-grained logical inconsistencies
that are overlooked by existing evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Building facades represent a significant untapped resource for solar energy
generation in dense urban environments, yet assessing their photovoltaic (PV)
potential remains challenging due to complex geometries and semantic com
ponents. This study introduces SF-SPA (Semantic Facade Solar-PV Assessment), an
automated framework that transforms street-view photographs into quantitative
PV deployment assessments. The approach combines com puter vision and
artificial intelligence techniques to address three key challenges: perspective
distortion correction, semantic understanding of facade elements, and spatial
reasoning for PV layout optimization. Our four-stage pipeline processes images
through geometric rectification, zero-shot semantic segmentation, Large
Language Model (LLM) guided spatial reasoning, and energy simulation.
Validation across 80 buildings in four countries demonstrates ro bust
performance with mean area estimation errors of 6.2% &#177; 2.8% compared to
expert annotations. The auto mated assessment requires approximately 100
seconds per building, a substantial gain in efficiency over manual methods.
Simulated energy yield predictions confirm the method's reliability and
applicability for regional poten tial studies, urban energy planning, and
building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) deployment. Code is available at:

Method: 两阶段框架：1）使用视觉语言模型预测符合物理规律的粗粒度运动轨迹；2）通过基于注意力的机制进行细粒度运动精化

Result: 在UCF-101和MSR-VTT数据集上表现优于现有方法，FVD分数分别为545和539

Abstract: Current video generation models produce physically inconsistent motion that
violates real-world dynamics. We propose TrajVLM-Gen, a two-stage framework for
physics-aware image-to-video generation. First, we employ a Vision Language
Model to predict coarse-grained motion trajectories that maintain consistency
with real-world physics. Second, these trajectories guide video generation
through attention-based mechanisms for fine-grained motion refinement. We build
a trajectory prediction dataset based on video tracking data with realistic
motion patterns. Experiments on UCF-101 and MSR-VTT demonstrate that
TrajVLM-Gen outperforms existing methods, achieving competitive FVD scores of
545 on UCF-101 and 539 on MSR-VTT.

TL;DR: 提出了ADQA基准测试，用于评估音频描述在长视频片段中的质量，发现现有自动生成方法远不如人工撰写，并量化了音频描述的主观性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动音频描述生成研究大多关注短片段，且仅与单一参考进行比较，忽略了音频描述撰写的主观性本质。

Method: 通过分析同一电影的两个独立音频描述轨道来量化主观性，并创建ADQA基准测试，包含视觉欣赏和叙事理解两类问题。

Result: 当前音频描述生成方法在长视频片段上的表现远逊于人工撰写，ADQA基准能有效评估音频描述质量。

Conclusion: 需要开发更好的长视频音频描述生成方法，并建立了公共排行榜用于持续评估。

Abstract: Audio descriptions (ADs) narrate important visual details in movies, enabling
Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users to understand narratives and appreciate visual
details. Existing works in automatic AD generation mostly focus on few-second
trimmed clips, and evaluate them by comparing against a single ground-truth
reference AD. However, writing ADs is inherently subjective. Through alignment
and analysis of two independent AD tracks for the same movies, we quantify the
subjectivity in when and whether to describe, and what and how to highlight.
Thus, we show that working with trimmed clips is inadequate. We propose ADQA, a
QA benchmark that evaluates ADs at the level of few-minute long, coherent video
segments, testing whether they would help BLV users understand the story and
appreciate visual details. ADQA features visual appreciation (VA) questions
about visual facts and narrative understanding (NU) questions based on the
plot. Through ADQA, we show that current AD generation methods lag far behind
human-authored ADs. We conclude with several recommendations for future work
and introduce a public leaderboard for benchmarking.

Motivation: 现有的短语定位研究主要局限于单视图图像，忽略了立体视觉中丰富的几何线索。为了将短语定位扩展到立体领域，需要构建包含立体图像对的数据集。

Method: 基于PhraseCut数据集，利用GenStereo从现有的单视图数据生成准确的右视图图像，从而构建包含立体图像对、对齐分割掩码和短语注释的PhraseStereo数据集。

Result: 成功创建了PhraseStereo数据集，为语言、视觉和3D感知交叉领域的研究奠定了基础，支持模型在语义和几何上的联合推理。

Conclusion: PhraseStereo数据集填补了立体视觉中短语定位的空白，为未来多模态学习研究提供了重要资源，鼓励开发能够同时处理语义和几何信息的模型。

Abstract: Understanding how natural language phrases correspond to specific regions in
images is a key challenge in multimodal semantic segmentation. Recent advances
in phrase grounding are largely limited to single-view images, neglecting the
rich geometric cues available in stereo vision. For this, we introduce
PhraseStereo, the first novel dataset that brings phrase-region segmentation to
stereo image pairs. PhraseStereo builds upon the PhraseCut dataset by
leveraging GenStereo to generate accurate right-view images from existing
single-view data, enabling the extension of phrase grounding into the stereo
domain. This new setting introduces unique challenges and opportunities for
multimodal learning, particularly in leveraging depth cues for more precise and
context-aware grounding. By providing stereo image pairs with aligned
segmentation masks and phrase annotations, PhraseStereo lays the foundation for
future research at the intersection of language, vision, and 3D perception,
encouraging the development of models that can reason jointly over semantics
and geometry. The PhraseStereo dataset will be released online upon acceptance
of this work.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出World-Language Models (WorldLMs)，将视频扩散模型重新用作生成编码器，通过单步去噪获取视觉嵌入，在视觉语言模型中融入世界模型先验，显著提升了空间推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着强大的视频基础模型的出现，探索它们是否能替代传统视觉编码器范式进行通用多模态理解，以及如何系统研究世界模型在通用多模态任务中的潜力。

Method: 重新利用视频扩散模型作为生成编码器，执行单步去噪过程，将得到的潜在表示作为视觉嵌入，构建名为Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA)的模型变体。

Result: WorldLMs能够捕获对下游理解有用的潜在表示，与常规编码器有显著区别；DyVA显著增强了空间推理能力，使单图像模型能够进行多帧推理，在视觉推理任务中超越了开源和专有基线，达到最先进或相当的性能。

Conclusion: 世界模型从视频预训练中继承的运动一致性内部化带来了性能提升，该研究为利用世界模型先验的新VLM家族铺平了道路，是实现通用视觉学习者的有前景路径。

Abstract: Trained on internet-scale video data, generative world models are
increasingly recognized as powerful world simulators that can generate
consistent and plausible dynamics over structure, motion, and physics. This
raises a natural question: with the advent of strong video foundational models,
might they supplant conventional vision encoder paradigms for general-purpose
multimodal understanding? While recent studies have begun to explore the
potential of world models on common vision tasks, these explorations typically
lack a systematic investigation of generic, multimodal tasks. In this work, we
strive to investigate the capabilities when world model priors are transferred
into Vision-Language Models: we re-purpose a video diffusion model as a
generative encoder to perform a single denoising step and treat the resulting
latents as a set of visual embedding. We empirically investigate this class of
models, which we refer to as World-Language Models (WorldLMs), and we find that
generative encoders can capture latents useful for downstream understanding
that show distinctions from conventional encoders. Naming our best-performing
variant Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA), we further discover that this method
significantly enhances spatial reasoning abilities and enables single-image
models to perform multi-frame reasoning. Through the curation of a suite of
visual reasoning tasks, we find DyVA to surpass both open-source and
proprietary baselines, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance. We
attribute these gains to WorldLM's inherited motion-consistency internalization
from video pre-training. Finally, we systematically explore extensive model
designs to highlight promising directions for future work. We hope our study
can pave the way for a new family of VLMs that leverage priors from world
models and are on a promising path towards generalist vision learners.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Next-Scale Autoregressive Modeling (NSARM)框架，通过两阶段训练实现鲁棒的真实图像超分辨率，在保持快速推理的同时获得优于现有方法的视觉效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有真实图像超分辨率方法存在效率与质量之间的权衡：基于扩散模型的方法质量高但速度慢，直接输入低质量图像的方法快但质量较低，且对输入图像退化程度敏感。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：首先训练转换网络将低质量图像映射到初步尺度，然后进行端到端的全模型微调，基于视觉自回归模型的next-scale预测策略。

Result: NSARM在定量和定性评估中均优于现有真实图像超分辨率方法，保持快速推理速度，对输入图像质量具有更高的鲁棒性和更强的泛化性能。

Conclusion: NSARM作为纯自回归模型，在真实图像超分辨率任务中实现了视觉效果的显著提升，同时保持高效推理，对输入退化具有更好的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Most recent real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods employ
pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models to synthesize the high-quality
image either from random Gaussian noise, which yields realistic results but is
slow due to iterative denoising, or directly from the input low-quality image,
which is efficient but at the price of lower output quality. These approaches
train ControlNet or LoRA modules while keeping the pre-trained model fixed,
which often introduces over-enhanced artifacts and hallucinations, suffering
from the robustness to inputs of varying degradations. Recent visual
autoregressive (AR) models, such as pre-trained Infinity, can provide strong
T2I generation capabilities while offering superior efficiency by using the
bitwise next-scale prediction strategy. Building upon next-scale prediction, we
introduce a robust Real-ISR framework, namely Next-Scale Autoregressive
Modeling (NSARM). Specifically, we train NSARM in two stages: a transformation
network is first trained to map the input low-quality image to preliminary
scales, followed by an end-to-end full-model fine-tuning. Such a comprehensive
fine-tuning enhances the robustness of NSARM in Real-ISR tasks without
compromising its generative capability. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
evaluations demonstrate that as a pure AR model, NSARM achieves superior visual
results over existing Real-ISR methods while maintaining a fast inference
speed. Most importantly, it demonstrates much higher robustness to the quality
of input images, showing stronger generalization performance. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分类方法往往忽略不同层次类别间的内在关系，丢失重要的监督信号，需要更好地建模层次结构中的类间关系。

Method: 使用高斯混合模型和注意力机制来捕捉层次特定特征，显式建模类间关系和不平衡类别分布，实现跨所有层次级别的细粒度聚类。

Result: 在CIFAR100和ModelNet40数据集上，线性评估准确率比现有层次对比学习方法高出2个百分点，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效建模层次结构关系，在计算机视觉等领域具有应用潜力，定量和定性结果均验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Hierarchical classification is a crucial task in many applications, where
objects are organized into multiple levels of categories. However, conventional
classification approaches often neglect inherent inter-class relationships at
different hierarchy levels, thus missing important supervisory signals. Thus,
we propose two novel hierarchical contrastive learning (HMLC) methods. The
first, leverages a Gaussian Mixture Model (G-HMLC) and the second uses an
attention mechanism to capture hierarchy-specific features (A-HMLC), imitating
human processing. Our approach explicitly models inter-class relationships and
imbalanced class distribution at higher hierarchy levels, enabling fine-grained
clustering across all hierarchy levels. On the competitive CIFAR100 and
ModelNet40 datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in linear
evaluation, outperforming existing hierarchical contrastive learning methods by
2 percentage points in terms of accuracy. The effectiveness of our approach is
backed by both quantitative and qualitative results, highlighting its potential
for applications in computer vision and beyond.

TL;DR: 提出GSMamba，一种结合Mamba选择性状态空间模型和移位窗口自注意力的混合架构，用于视频超分辨率，通过Gather-Scatter机制解决遮挡问题。


<details>

Motivation: 传统RNN在视频超分辨率中存在梯度消失、缺乏并行性和推理速度慢的问题，而Transformer由于二次复杂度不适合长序列。Mamba提供了线性时间复杂度的替代方案，但单独使用难以捕捉细粒度空间依赖。

Method: 结合移位窗口自注意力进行空间上下文聚合和Mamba选择性扫描进行高效时间传播，引入Gather-Scatter Mamba机制在Mamba传播前后对特征进行扭曲和散射。

Result: 该方法有效减少了遮挡伪影，确保聚合信息在所有帧间的有效重新分布。

Conclusion: GSMamba混合架构在保持高效时间建模的同时，增强了空间上下文捕捉能力，为视频超分辨率提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs)-most notably RNNs-have historically played a
central role in sequential modeling. Although attention mechanisms such as
Transformers have since dominated due to their ability to model global context,
their quadratic complexity and limited scalability make them less suited for
long sequences. Video super-resolution (VSR) methods have traditionally relied
on recurrent architectures to propagate features across frames. However, such
approaches suffer from well-known issues including vanishing gradients, lack of
parallelism, and slow inference speed. Recent advances in selective SSMs like
Mamba offer a compelling alternative: by enabling input-dependent state
transitions with linear-time complexity, Mamba mitigates these issues while
maintaining strong long-range modeling capabilities. Despite this potential,
Mamba alone struggles to capture fine-grained spatial dependencies due to its
causal nature and lack of explicit context aggregation. To address this, we
propose a hybrid architecture that combines shifted window self-attention for
spatial context aggregation with Mamba-based selective scanning for efficient
temporal propagation. Furthermore, we introduce Gather-Scatter Mamba (GSM), an
alignment-aware mechanism that warps features toward a center anchor frame
within the temporal window before Mamba propagation and scatters them back
afterward, effectively reducing occlusion artifacts and ensuring effective
redistribution of aggregated information across all frames. The official
implementation is provided at: https://github.com/Ko-Lani/GSMamba.

Conclusion: AI-CNet3D模型通过解剖学信息引导的交叉注意力网络，在保持高诊断性能的同时显著提高了计算效率，为青光眼诊断提供了有效的3D OCT分析方法。

Abstract: Glaucoma is a progressive eye disease that leads to optic nerve damage,
causing irreversible vision loss if left untreated. Optical coherence
tomography (OCT) has become a crucial tool for glaucoma diagnosis, offering
high-resolution 3D scans of the retina and optic nerve. However, the
conventional practice of condensing information from 3D OCT volumes into 2D
reports often results in the loss of key structural details. To address this,
we propose a novel hybrid deep learning model that integrates cross-attention
mechanisms into a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN), enabling the
extraction of critical features from the superior and inferior hemiretinas, as
well as from the optic nerve head (ONH) and macula, within OCT volumes. We
introduce Channel Attention REpresentations (CAREs) to visualize
cross-attention outputs and leverage them for consistency-based multi-task
fine-tuning, aligning them with Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Maps
(Grad-CAMs) from the CNN's final convolutional layer to enhance performance,
interpretability, and anatomical coherence. We have named this model AI-CNet3D
(AI-`See'-Net3D) to reflect its design as an Anatomically-Informed
Cross-attention Network operating on 3D data. By dividing the volume along two
axes and applying cross-attention, our model enhances glaucoma classification
by capturing asymmetries between the hemiretinal regions while integrating
information from the optic nerve head and macula. We validate our approach on
two large datasets, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art attention and
convolutional models across all key metrics. Finally, our model is
computationally efficient, reducing the parameter count by one-hundred--fold
compared to other attention mechanisms while maintaining high diagnostic
performance and comparable GFLOPS.

Motivation: 医学影像迁移学习中的源数据集选择通常依赖研究者直觉而非系统原则，这会影响算法的泛化能力和患者预后。研究旨在从人机交互视角理解实践者如何选择源数据集。

Method: 采用任务型调查方法，对机器学习从业者进行调研，从人机交互角度分析源数据集选择过程，不同于以往仅基准测试模型和实验设置的研究。

Result: 发现源数据集选择具有任务依赖性，受社区实践、数据集属性、计算相似性和感知相似性影响。相似性评分与预期性能并不总是一致，参与者常使用模糊术语。

Conclusion: 需要更清晰的定义和人机交互工具来明确源数据集选择启发式，为迁移学习中更系统的源选择提供实用见解。

Abstract: Transfer learning is crucial for medical imaging, yet the selection of source
datasets - which can impact the generalizability of algorithms, and thus
patient outcomes - often relies on researchers' intuition rather than
systematic principles. This study investigates these decisions through a
task-based survey with machine learning practitioners. Unlike prior work that
benchmarks models and experimental setups, we take a human-centered HCI
perspective on how practitioners select source datasets. Our findings indicate
that choices are task-dependent and influenced by community practices, dataset
properties, and computational (data embedding), or perceived visual or semantic
similarity. However, similarity ratings and expected performance are not always
aligned, challenging a traditional "more similar is better" view. Participants
often used ambiguous terminology, which suggests a need for clearer definitions
and HCI tools to make them explicit and usable. By clarifying these heuristics,
this work provides practical insights for more systematic source selection in
transfer learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新定义伪离散扩散方法，直接在one-hot空间中保持核心扩散特性，而不是依赖连续潜在空间扩散或掩码策略。

Method: 使用浮点编码的one-hot类数据作为扩散输入，引入时间步条件交叉熵损失，在扩散模型输出和原始one-hot标签之间建立桥梁。

Result: 在分类任务上表现优于基线，在图像描述任务上展现出优秀的文本生成能力，各组件均带来可衡量的性能提升。

Conclusion: ADD框架通过协同设计在判别性和生成性学习之间建立桥梁，验证了在one-hot空间中直接进行扩散的有效性。

Abstract: We propose an Authentic Discrete Diffusion (ADD) framework that fundamentally
redefines prior pseudo-discrete approaches by preserving core diffusion
characteristics directly in the one-hot space through a suite of coordinated
mechanisms. Unlike conventional "pseudo" discrete diffusion (PDD) methods, ADD
reformulates the diffusion input by directly using float-encoded one-hot class
data, without relying on diffusing in the continuous latent spaces or masking
policies. At its core, a timestep-conditioned cross-entropy loss is introduced
between the diffusion model's outputs and the original one-hot labels. This
synergistic design establishes a bridge between discriminative and generative
learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ADD not only achieves superior
performance on classification tasks compared to the baseline, but also exhibits
excellent text generation capabilities on Image captioning. Extensive ablations
validate the measurable gains of each component.

Abstract: Manual annotation of anatomical landmarks on 3D facial scans is a
time-consuming and expertise-dependent task, yet it remains critical for
clinical assessments, morphometric analysis, and craniofacial research. While
several deep learning methods have been proposed for facial landmark
localization, most focus on pseudo-landmarks or require complex input
representations, limiting their clinical applicability. This study presents a
fully automated deep learning pipeline (PAL-Net) for localizing 50 anatomical
landmarks on stereo-photogrammetry facial models. The method combines coarse
alignment, region-of-interest filtering, and an initial approximation of
landmarks with a patch-based pointwise CNN enhanced by attention mechanisms.
Trained and evaluated on 214 annotated scans from healthy adults, PAL-Net
achieved a mean localization error of 3.686 mm and preserves relevant
anatomical distances with a 2.822 mm average error, comparable to
intra-observer variability. To assess generalization, the model was further
evaluated on 700 subjects from the FaceScape dataset, achieving a point-wise
error of 0.41\,mm and a distance-wise error of 0.38\,mm. Compared to existing
methods, PAL-Net offers a favorable trade-off between accuracy and
computational cost. While performance degrades in regions with poor mesh
quality (e.g., ears, hairline), the method demonstrates consistent accuracy
across most anatomical regions. PAL-Net generalizes effectively across datasets
and facial regions, outperforming existing methods in both point-wise and
structural evaluations. It provides a lightweight, scalable solution for
high-throughput 3D anthropometric analysis, with potential to support clinical
workflows and reduce reliance on manual annotation. Source code can be found at

Abstract: Self-supervised learning for inverse problems allows to train a
reconstruction network from noise and/or incomplete data alone. These methods
have the potential of enabling learning-based solutions when obtaining
ground-truth references for training is expensive or even impossible. In this
paper, we propose a new self-supervised learning strategy devised for the
challenging setting where measurements are observed via a single incomplete
observation model. We introduce a new definition of equivariance in the context
of reconstruction networks, and show that the combination of self-supervised
splitting losses and equivariant reconstruction networks results in unbiased
estimates of the supervised loss. Through a series of experiments on image
inpainting, accelerated magnetic resonance imaging, and compressive sensing, we
demonstrate that the proposed loss achieves state-of-the-art performance in
settings with highly rank-deficient forward models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级的向量平移特征对齐(VPFA)框架，通过建模分辨率特定的特征差异来解决跨分辨率行人重识别问题，显著优于现有方法且效率更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在监控场景中，不同相机距离导致行人图像分辨率差异显著，使得低分辨率图像难以与高分辨率图像匹配，限制了ReID性能。现有方法依赖超分辨率或联合学习，增加了复杂度且性能遇到瓶颈。

Method: 基于语义方向在特征空间中的发现，提出向量平移特征对齐框架，通过建模分辨率特定特征差异来进行跨分辨率ReID，无需复杂的超分辨率处理。

Result: 在多个CR-ReID基准测试上的实验结果表明，该方法显著优于现有最先进基线模型，同时获得更高的效率。

Conclusion: 基于新发现的语义方向在ReID特征空间中的存在，提出的VPFA框架在跨分辨率行人重识别任务中表现出优异的性能和效率。

Abstract: In surveillance scenarios, varying camera distances cause significant
differences among pedestrian image resolutions, making it hard to match
low-resolution (LR) images with high-resolution (HR) counterparts, limiting the
performance of Re-Identification (ReID) tasks. Most existing Cross-Resolution
ReID (CR-ReID) methods rely on super-resolution (SR) or joint learning for
feature compensation, which increases training and inference complexity and has
reached a performance bottleneck in recent studies. Inspired by semantic
directions in the word embedding space, we empirically discover that semantic
directions implying resolution differences also emerge in the feature space of
ReID, and we substantiate this finding from a statistical perspective using
Canonical Correlation Analysis and Pearson Correlation Analysis. Based on this
interesting finding, we propose a lightweight and effective Vector Panning
Feature Alignment (VPFA) framework, which conducts CR-ReID from a novel
perspective of modeling the resolution-specific feature discrepancy. Extensive
experimental results on multiple CR-ReID benchmarks show that our method
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baseline models while
obtaining higher efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of
our model based on the new finding in this paper.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfVSR提出了一种自回归一步扩散范式，用于解决长视频超分辨率的效率和可扩展性问题，实现了流式推理并充分利用预训练视频扩散先验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频超分辨率方法在处理长序列时面临两个挑战：(1) 全序列多步去噪的高计算成本导致效率低下；(2) 时间分解导致伪影和不连续，限制了可扩展性。

Method: 1. 将预训练DiT适配为因果结构，通过滚动KV缓存和联合视觉指导保持局部和全局一致性；2. 将扩散过程蒸馏为单步，采用分块像素监督和跨块分布匹配实现高效处理。

Result: 该方法在长视频超分辨率中达到最先进质量，语义一致性增强，相比MGLD-VSR等方法实现高达58倍加速，并构建了专门的长序列评估基准。

Conclusion: InfVSR突破了长视频超分辨率的限制，实现了高效可扩展的无界长度视频处理，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Real-world videos often extend over thousands of frames. Existing video
super-resolution (VSR) approaches, however, face two persistent challenges when
processing long sequences: (1) inefficiency due to the heavy cost of multi-step
denoising for full-length sequences; and (2) poor scalability hindered by
temporal decomposition that causes artifacts and discontinuities. To break
these limits, we propose InfVSR, which novelly reformulates VSR as an
autoregressive-one-step-diffusion paradigm. This enables streaming inference
while fully leveraging pre-trained video diffusion priors. First, we adapt the
pre-trained DiT into a causal structure, maintaining both local and global
coherence via rolling KV-cache and joint visual guidance. Second, we distill
the diffusion process into a single step efficiently, with patch-wise pixel
supervision and cross-chunk distribution matching. Together, these designs
enable efficient and scalable VSR for unbounded-length videos. To fill the gap
in long-form video evaluation, we build a new benchmark tailored for extended
sequences and further introduce semantic-level metrics to comprehensively
assess temporal consistency. Our method pushes the frontier of long-form VSR,
achieves state-of-the-art quality with enhanced semantic consistency, and
delivers up to 58x speed-up over existing methods such as MGLD-VSR. Code will
be available at https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/InfVSR.

TL;DR: JEPA-T是一个统一的多模态框架，通过联合嵌入预测Transformer处理离散视觉和文本token，结合交叉注意力和文本嵌入注入来增强文本-图像融合，在ImageNet-1K上展现出强大的数据效率和开放词汇泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代文本到图像生成主要依赖基于token的架构，但有效融合文本与视觉token仍然是一个挑战。需要开发能够平衡条件强度和骨干通用性的融合方法。

Method: 提出JEPA-T框架：将图像和标题编码为离散token，通过联合嵌入预测Transformer处理；在特征预测器后加入交叉注意力进行条件去噪；在流匹配损失前注入原始文本嵌入以改善对齐；同一网络在推理时执行类条件和自由文本图像生成。

Conclusion: 后期架构融合与目标级对齐相结合，在基于token的文本到图像生成中提供了条件强度与骨干通用性之间的有效平衡。

Abstract: Modern Text-to-Image (T2I) generation increasingly relies on token-centric
architectures that are trained with self-supervision, yet effectively fusing
text with visual tokens remains a challenge. We propose \textbf{JEPA-T}, a
unified multimodal framework that encodes images and captions into discrete
visual and textual tokens, processed by a joint-embedding predictive
Transformer. To enhance fusion, we incorporate cross-attention after the
feature predictor for conditional denoising while maintaining a task-agnostic
backbone. Additionally, raw texts embeddings are injected prior to the flow
matching loss to improve alignment during training. During inference, the same
network performs both class-conditional and free-text image generation by
iteratively denoising visual tokens conditioned on text. Evaluations on
ImageNet-1K demonstrate that JEPA-T achieves strong data efficiency,
open-vocabulary generalization, and consistently outperforms non-fusion and
late-fusion baselines. Our approach shows that late architectural fusion
combined with objective-level alignment offers an effective balance between
conditioning strength and backbone generality in token-based T2I.The code is
now available: https://github.com/justin-herry/JEPA-T.git

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉定位方法即使从已知相机位姿的映射图像开始，仍需要数小时到数分钟的映射时间，限制了系统的实用性。本文旨在探索能否在保持竞争力的精度下实现更快的定位。

Method: 将多个映射图像表示为3D空间中的特征集合，利用这些映射特征预测查询图像与场景的对应关系，从而估计相机位姿。结合图像检索技术实现快速定位。

Result: FastForward在最小地图准备时间下达到了最先进的精度，并展现出对未见领域（包括具有挑战性的大规模室外环境）的鲁棒泛化能力。

Conclusion: FastForward证明了通过单次前向传播实现快速而准确的视觉定位是可行的，为实时定位系统提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Visually localizing an image, i.e., estimating its camera pose, requires
building a scene representation that serves as a visual map. The representation
we choose has direct consequences towards the practicability of our system.
Even when starting from mapping images with known camera poses,
state-of-the-art approaches still require hours of mapping time in the worst
case, and several minutes in the best. This work raises the question whether we
can achieve competitive accuracy much faster. We introduce FastForward, a
method that creates a map representation and relocalizes a query image
on-the-fly in a single feed-forward pass. At the core, we represent multiple
mapping images as a collection of features anchored in 3D space. FastForward
utilizes these mapping features to predict image-to-scene correspondences for
the query image, enabling the estimation of its camera pose. We couple
FastForward with image retrieval and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy when
compared to other approaches with minimal map preparation time. Furthermore,
FastForward demonstrates robust generalization to unseen domains, including
challenging large-scale outdoor environments.

Result: 实验表明该方法提高了生成质量，增强了模型产生语义一致结果的能力。

Conclusion: 该方法有效缓解了顺序生成中的错误累积问题，在共享顺序预测框架下提升了视觉-语言建模性能。

Abstract: Autoregressive models excel in sequential modeling and have proven to be
effective for vision-language data. However, the spatial nature of visual
signals conflicts with the sequential dependencies of next-token prediction,
leading to suboptimal results. This work proposes a plug-and-play refinement
module to enhance the complex spatial correspondence modeling within the
generated visual sequence. This module operates as a post-pretraining step to
jointly refine all generated tokens of autoregressive model, enhancing
vision-language modeling under a shared sequential prediction framework. By
leveraging global context and relationship across the tokens, our method
mitigates the error accumulation issue within the sequential generation.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves the generation
quality, enhancing the model's ability to produce semantically consistent
results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在图像生成中应用CFG时面临指导衰减（条件-无条件差距快速消失）和过度指导（强条件破坏视觉连贯性）的问题

Method: SoftCFG：不确定性引导的推理方法，在所有token序列中分布自适应扰动，让每个生成的token贡献确定性加权的指导；引入步长归一化来限制SoftCFG的累积扰动

Result: SoftCFG显著提升图像质量，在ImageNet 256上达到自回归模型中最先进的FID分数

Conclusion: SoftCFG是无需训练、模型无关的方法，能无缝集成到现有AR流程中，有效解决CFG在自回归模型中的指导问题

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have emerged as powerful tools for image
generation by modeling images as sequences of discrete tokens. While
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has been adopted to improve conditional
generation, its application in AR models faces two key issues: guidance
diminishing, where the conditional-unconditional gap quickly vanishes as
decoding progresses, and over-guidance, where strong conditions distort visual
coherence. To address these challenges, we propose SoftCFG, an
uncertainty-guided inference method that distributes adaptive perturbations
across all tokens in the sequence. The key idea behind SoftCFG is to let each
generated token contribute certainty-weighted guidance, ensuring that the
signal persists across steps while resolving conflicts between text guidance
and visual context. To further stabilize long-sequence generation, we introduce
Step Normalization, which bounds cumulative perturbations of SoftCFG. Our
method is training-free, model-agnostic, and seamlessly integrates with
existing AR pipelines. Experiments show that SoftCFG significantly improves
image quality over standard CFG and achieves state-of-the-art FID on ImageNet
256 among autoregressive models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CAM方法虽然能突出显示影响预测的空间区域，但无法提供这些激活区域背后的语义信息，限制了模型在高风险应用中的可信度。

Method: 使用CLIP嵌入和线性判别分析获得通道级语义表示，然后与CAM权重聚合生成文本描述，同时将特征通道分组以提供更细粒度的视觉-文本解释。

Result: 在ImageNet、CLEVR和CUB数据集上的实验表明，TextCAM能产生忠实且可解释的推理，提高人类理解能力，检测虚假相关性，并保持模型保真度。

Conclusion: TextCAM通过结合空间定位和语义描述，为深度视觉模型提供了更丰富和可解释的解释方法，增强了模型的可信度和透明度。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success across domains
but remain difficult to interpret, limiting their trustworthiness in
high-stakes applications. This paper focuses on deep vision models, for which a
dominant line of explainability methods are Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and
its variants working by highlighting spatial regions that drive predictions. We
figure out that CAM provides little semantic insight into what attributes
underlie these activations. To address this limitation, we propose TextCAM, a
novel explanation framework that enriches CAM with natural languages. TextCAM
combines the precise spatial localization of CAM with the semantic alignment of
vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, we derive channel-level semantic
representations using CLIP embeddings and linear discriminant analysis, and
aggregate them with CAM weights to produce textual descriptions of salient
visual evidence. This yields explanations that jointly specify where the model
attends and what visual attributes likely support its decision. We further
extend TextCAM to generate feature channels into semantically coherent groups,
enabling more fine-grained visual-textual explanations. Experiments on
ImageNet, CLEVR, and CUB demonstrate that TextCAM produces faithful and
interpretable rationales that improve human understanding, detect spurious
correlations, and preserve model fidelity.

Result: 在多个数据集上与人类偏好高度一致，作为奖励模型使用时比基于标量的奖励模型提升10%的生成质量。

Conclusion: ImageDoctor作为评估指标有效，作为偏好调优的奖励模型能显著提升生成质量。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models has increased the need
for reliable human preference modeling, a demand further amplified by recent
progress in reinforcement learning for preference alignment. However, existing
approaches typically quantify the quality of a generated image using a single
scalar, limiting their ability to provide comprehensive and interpretable
feedback on image quality. To address this, we introduce ImageDoctor, a unified
multi-aspect T2I model evaluation framework that assesses image quality across
four complementary dimensions: plausibility, semantic alignment, aesthetics,
and overall quality. ImageDoctor also provides pixel-level flaw indicators in
the form of heatmaps, which highlight misaligned or implausible regions, and
can be used as a dense reward for T2I model preference alignment. Inspired by
the diagnostic process, we improve the detail sensitivity and reasoning
capability of ImageDoctor by introducing a "look-think-predict" paradigm, where
the model first localizes potential flaws, then generates reasoning, and
finally concludes the evaluation with quantitative scores. Built on top of a
vision-language model and trained through a combination of supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, ImageDoctor demonstrates strong
alignment with human preference across multiple datasets, establishing its
effectiveness as an evaluation metric. Furthermore, when used as a reward model
for preference tuning, ImageDoctor significantly improves generation quality --
achieving an improvement of 10% over scalar-based reward models.

Conclusion: AT-RA方法有效解决了高光谱数据特有的挑战，在保持光谱语义信息的同时显著提升了模型的对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that hyperspectral classification models based
on deep learning are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose
significant security risks. Although several approaches have attempted to
enhance adversarial robustness by modifying network architectures, these
methods often rely on customized designs that limit scalability and fail to
defend effectively against strong attacks. To address these challenges, we
introduce adversarial training to the hyperspectral domain, which is widely
regarded as one of the most effective defenses against adversarial attacks.
Through extensive empirical analyses, we demonstrate that while adversarial
training does enhance robustness across various models and datasets,
hyperspectral data introduces unique challenges not seen in RGB images.
Specifically, we find that adversarial noise and the non-smooth nature of
adversarial examples can distort or eliminate important spectral semantic
information. To mitigate this issue, we employ data augmentation techniques and
propose a novel hyperspectral adversarial training method, termed AT-RA. By
increasing the diversity of spectral information and ensuring spatial
smoothness, AT-RA preserves and corrects spectral semantics in hyperspectral
images. Experimental results show that AT-RA improves adversarial robustness by
21.34% against AutoAttack and 18.78% against PGD-50 while boosting benign
accuracy by 2.68%.

Result: 相比其他方法，该方法生成的匿名化人脸与原图的视觉相似度更低，同时保持高质量图像。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了安全、高质量的可逆人脸匿名化，为隐私保护提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Face images processed by computer vision algorithms contain sensitive
personal information that malicious actors can capture without consent. These
privacy and security risks highlight the need for effective face anonymization
methods. Current methods struggle to propose a good trade-off between a secure
scheme with high-quality image generation and reversibility for later person
authentication. Diffusion-based approaches produce high-quality anonymized
images but lack the secret key mechanism to ensure that only authorized parties
can reverse the process. In this paper, we introduce, to our knowledge, the
first secure, high-quality reversible anonymization method based on a diffusion
model. We propose to combine the secret key with the latent faces
representation of the diffusion model. To preserve identity-irrelevant
features, generation is constrained by a facial mask, maintaining high-quality
images. By using a deterministic forward and backward diffusion process, our
approach enforces that the original face can be recovered with the correct
secret key. We also show that the proposed method produces anonymized faces
that are less visually similar to the original faces, compared to other
previous work.

Conclusion: KeySG通过分层图表示和关键帧增强，有效解决了3D场景图的语义限制和可扩展性问题，支持复杂和模糊查询的处理。

Abstract: In recent years, 3D scene graphs have emerged as a powerful world
representation, offering both geometric accuracy and semantic richness.
Combining 3D scene graphs with large language models enables robots to reason,
plan, and navigate in complex human-centered environments. However, current
approaches for constructing 3D scene graphs are semantically limited to a
predefined set of relationships, and their serialization in large environments
can easily exceed an LLM's context window. We introduce KeySG, a framework that
represents 3D scenes as a hierarchical graph consisting of floors, rooms,
objects, and functional elements, where nodes are augmented with multi-modal
information extracted from keyframes selected to optimize geometric and visual
coverage. The keyframes allow us to efficiently leverage VLM to extract scene
information, alleviating the need to explicitly model relationship edges
between objects, enabling more general, task-agnostic reasoning and planning.
Our approach can process complex and ambiguous queries while mitigating the
scalability issues associated with large scene graphs by utilizing a
hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to extract relevant
context from the graph. Evaluated across four distinct benchmarks -- including
3D object segmentation and complex query retrieval -- KeySG outperforms prior
approaches on most metrics, demonstrating its superior semantic richness and
efficiency.

safety-critical pipelines. We present Shapley-credited Context-Aware
Dawid-Skene with Agreement, a game-theoretic fusion method for multi-label
understanding of ego-view dashcam video. It learns per-model, per-label,
context-conditioned reliabilities from labelled history and, at inference,
converts each model's report into an agreement-guardrailed log-likelihood ratio
that is combined with a contextual prior and a public reputation state updated
via Shapley-based team credit. The result is calibrated, thresholdable
posteriors that (i) amplify agreement among reliable models, (ii) preserve
uniquely correct single-model signals, and (iii) adapt to drift. To specialise
general VLMs, we curate 1,000 real-world dashcam clips with structured
annotations (scene description, manoeuvre recommendation, rationale) via an
automatic pipeline that fuses HDD ground truth, vehicle kinematics, and YOLOv11
+ BoT-SORT tracking, guided by a three-step chain-of-thought prompt; three
heterogeneous VLMs are then fine-tuned with LoRA. We evaluate with Hamming
distance, Micro-Macro-F1, and average per-video latency. Empirically, the
proposed method achieves a 23% reduction in Hamming distance, 55% improvement
in Macro-F1, and 47% improvement in Micro-F1 when comparing with the best
single model, supporting VLM fusion as a calibrated, interpretable, and robust
decision-support component for AV pipelines.

TL;DR: EvoWorld是一个结合全景视频生成与演化3D记忆的世界模型，通过单张全景图像输入生成未来视频帧，并利用演化3D重建作为空间引导来增强视觉真实性和几何一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类在体验过的3D环境中进行心理探索和回放能力的启发，旨在实现空间一致的长时程探索。

Method: 首先使用具有细粒度视图控制的视频生成器生成未来视频帧，然后通过前馈即插即用transformer演化场景的3D重建，最后基于演化显式3D记忆的几何重投影合成未来帧。

Result: 在合成户外环境、Habitat室内场景和真实世界场景的基准测试中，演化3D记忆显著提升了视觉保真度并保持了空间场景一致性。

Conclusion: 演化3D记忆相比现有方法在视觉真实性和空间一致性方面有显著改进，代表了长时程空间一致世界建模的重要进展。

Abstract: Humans possess a remarkable ability to mentally explore and replay 3D
environments they have previously experienced. Inspired by this mental process,
we present EvoWorld: a world model that bridges panoramic video generation with
evolving 3D memory to enable spatially consistent long-horizon exploration.
Given a single panoramic image as input, EvoWorld first generates future video
frames by leveraging a video generator with fine-grained view control, then
evolves the scene's 3D reconstruction using a feedforward plug-and-play
transformer, and finally synthesizes futures by conditioning on geometric
reprojections from this evolving explicit 3D memory. Unlike prior
state-of-the-arts that synthesize videos only, our key insight lies in
exploiting this evolving 3D reconstruction as explicit spatial guidance for the
video generation process, projecting the reconstructed geometry onto target
viewpoints to provide rich spatial cues that significantly enhance both visual
realism and geometric consistency. To evaluate long-range exploration
capabilities, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark spanning synthetic
outdoor environments, Habitat indoor scenes, and challenging real-world
scenarios, with particular emphasis on loop-closure detection and spatial
coherence over extended trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our evolving 3D memory substantially improves visual fidelity and maintains
spatial scene coherence compared to existing approaches, representing a
significant advance toward long-horizon spatially consistent world modeling.

TL;DR: IMAGEdit是一个无需训练的视频多主体编辑框架，能够同时编辑任意数量的视频主体外观，同时保持非目标区域不变，无需微调或重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法在多主体编辑时存在提示侧多模态条件不足和掩码边界纠缠的问题，限制了其适用性。

Method: 通过提示引导的多模态对齐模块和基于先验的掩码重定向模块，提供鲁棒的多模态条件和精确的掩码序列，然后利用预训练的掩码驱动视频生成模型合成编辑后的视频。

Result: 在新构建的多主体基准MSVBench上的大量实验验证了IMAGEdit持续超越最先进方法。

Conclusion: IMAGEdit具有强大的泛化能力，能够解决多主体视频编辑中的关键挑战，显著扩展了视频编辑的适用性，并且与任何掩码驱动视频生成模型兼容。

Abstract: In this paper, we present IMAGEdit, a training-free framework for any number
of video subject editing that manipulates the appearances of multiple
designated subjects while preserving non-target regions, without finetuning or
retraining. We achieve this by providing robust multimodal conditioning and
precise mask sequences through a prompt-guided multimodal alignment module and
a prior-based mask retargeting module. We first leverage large models'
understanding and generation capabilities to produce multimodal information and
mask motion sequences for multiple subjects across various types. Then, the
obtained prior mask sequences are fed into a pretrained mask-driven video
generation model to synthesize the edited video. With strong generalization
capability, IMAGEdit remedies insufficient prompt-side multimodal conditioning
and overcomes mask boundary entanglement in videos with any number of subjects,
thereby significantly expanding the applicability of video editing. More
importantly, IMAGEdit is compatible with any mask-driven video generation
model, significantly improving overall performance. Extensive experiments on
our newly constructed multi-subject benchmark MSVBench verify that IMAGEdit
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Code, models, and datasets are

*Hong kyu Lee,Ruixuan Liu,Li Xiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为直接令牌优化（DTO）的新型自包含机器学习遗忘方法，该方法直接优化令牌级目标，无需外部资源，在多个基准数据集上比最新基线方法在遗忘质量上提升了16.8倍，同时保持相当的模型效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型遗忘方法通常依赖辅助语言模型、保留数据集甚至商业AI服务，这种做法通常不切实际且可能引入额外的隐私风险。

Method: 直接令牌优化（DTO）方法：对于要遗忘的序列，识别两类令牌 - 目标令牌（用于优化遗忘目标）和非目标令牌（用于保持模型效用），直接在令牌级别进行优化。

Result: 实验结果显示，DTO在多个基准数据集上比最新基线方法在遗忘质量上提升了16.8倍，同时保持相当的模型效用水平。

Conclusion: DTO是一种有效的自包含遗忘方法，无需外部资源即可实现高质量的遗忘，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Machine unlearning is an emerging technique that removes the influence of a
subset of training data (forget set) from a model without full retraining, with
applications including privacy protection, content moderation, and model
correction. The key challenge lies in ensuring that the model completely
forgets the knowledge of the forget set without compromising its overall
utility. Existing unlearning methods for large language models (LLMs) often
utilize auxiliary language models, retain datasets, or even commercial AI
services for effective unlearning and maintaining the model utility. However,
dependence on these external resources is often impractical and could
potentially introduce additional privacy risks. In this work, we propose direct
token optimization (DTO), a novel self-contained unlearning approach for LLMs
that directly optimizes the token level objectives and eliminates the need for
external resources. Given a sequence to unlearn, we identify two categories of
tokens: target tokens, which capture critical knowledge for unlearning, and the
remaining non-target tokens, which are crucial for maintaining the model
utility. The former are used to optimize the unlearning objective, while the
latter serve to preserve the model's performance. The experimental results show
that the proposed DTO achieves up to 16.8$\times$ improvement in forget quality
on several benchmark datasets than the latest baselines while maintaining a
comparable level of model utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 程序性活动助手在日常生活和职业场景中具有广泛应用潜力，但针对此类助手的系统开发仍处于探索不足的状态。

Method: TAMA框架使用多媒体返回工具实现交错多模态推理，在训练免费设置下工作，具有灵活工具选择能力。

Result: 在ProMQA-Assembly数据集上的实验表明，该方法能提升视觉语言模型（特别是GPT-5和MiMo-VL）的性能，消融研究证明了多媒体返回工具和灵活工具选择的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架和实验结果促进了图像思维范式在视频和多模态任务中的应用，推动了程序性活动助手的开发。

Abstract: Procedural activity assistants potentially support humans in a variety of
settings, from our daily lives, e.g., cooking or assembling flat-pack
furniture, to professional situations, e.g., manufacturing or biological
experiments. Despite its potential use cases, the system development tailored
for such an assistant is still underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework, called TAMA, a Tool-Augmented Multimodal Agent, for procedural
activity understanding. TAMA enables interleaved multimodal reasoning by making
use of multimedia-returning tools in a training-free setting. Our experimental
result on the multimodal procedural QA dataset, ProMQA-Assembly, shows that our
approach can improve the performance of vision-language models, especially
GPT-5 and MiMo-VL. Furthermore, our ablation studies provide empirical support
for the effectiveness of two features that characterize our framework,
multimedia-returning tools and agentic flexible tool selection. We believe our
proposed framework and experimental results facilitate the thinking with images
paradigm for video and multimodal tasks, let alone the development of
procedural activity assistants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管检索增强生成(RAG)在大语言模型(LLMs)中广泛应用以减少幻觉并改善自然语言生成，但目前尚无针对心电图-语言模型(ELMs)的开源RAG实现或系统研究。

Method: 开发了首个用于ELMs的开源RAG管道，包括基线模型和自然语言生成的消融研究，在三个公共数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验表明，配备RAG的ELMs相比非RAG基线模型持续提升了性能表现。

Conclusion: RAG技术能有效提升心电图-语言模型的性能，该研究为ELMs提供了首个开源RAG实现和系统设计指南。

Abstract: Interest in generative Electrocardiogram-Language Models (ELMs) is growing,
as they can produce textual responses conditioned on ECG signals and textual
queries. Unlike traditional classifiers that output label probabilities, ELMs
are more versatile, supporting domain-specific tasks (e.g., waveform analysis,
diagnosis, prognosis) as well as general tasks (e.g., open-ended questions,
dialogue). Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), widely used in Large Language
Models (LLMs) to ground LLM outputs in retrieved knowledge, helps reduce
hallucinations and improve natural language generation (NLG). However, despite
its promise, no open-source implementation or systematic study of RAG pipeline
design for ELMs currently exists. To address this gap, we present the first
open-source RAG pipeline for ELMs, along with baselines and ablation studies
for NLG. Experiments on three public datasets show that ELMs with RAG
consistently improves performance over non-RAG baselines and highlights key ELM
design considerations. Our code is available at:

Method: 通过精心设计的合成流程生成任务，包含人工验证环节，评估代理在异构搜索空间（包括生产力软件、云文件系统、邮件、聊天记录和开放网络）中检索相关信息的能力。

Result: 发布了涵盖10个领域（如销售、网络安全、合规）的15个深度研究任务，评估了多种开源和闭源模型（GPT、Llama、Qwen等）及策略的性能。

Conclusion: DRBench有效揭示了企业深度研究代理的优势、弱点和发展关键路径，为推进企业深度研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: We introduce DRBench, a benchmark for evaluating AI agents on complex,
open-ended deep research tasks in enterprise settings. Unlike prior benchmarks
that focus on simple questions or web-only queries, DRBench evaluates agents on
multi-step queries (for example, ``What changes should we make to our product
roadmap to ensure compliance with this standard?") that require identifying
supporting facts from both the public web and private company knowledge base.
Each task is grounded in realistic user personas and enterprise context,
spanning a heterogeneous search space that includes productivity software,
cloud file systems, emails, chat conversations, and the open web. Tasks are
generated through a carefully designed synthesis pipeline with
human-in-the-loop verification, and agents are evaluated on their ability to
recall relevant insights, maintain factual accuracy, and produce coherent,
well-structured reports. We release 15 deep research tasks across 10 domains,
such as Sales, Cybersecurity, and Compliance. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of DRBench by evaluating diverse DR agents across open- and closed-source
models (such as GPT, Llama, and Qwen) and DR strategies, highlighting their
strengths, weaknesses, and the critical path for advancing enterprise deep
research. Code is available at https://github.com/ServiceNow/drbench.

Motivation: 随着语言模型的广泛应用，需要更好地将个体用户特征融入模型。研究探讨能否利用个人信仰系统来改进模型对齐。

Method: 开发PrimeX数据集，收集858名美国居民的民意调查数据，包含书面信仰解释和原始世界信仰调查，用于评估世界观。

Result: 初步分析显示信仰解释和世界观信息对个性化语言模型具有价值，证明额外信仰信息对NLP和心理学研究都有益处。

Conclusion: PrimeX数据集为NLP和心理学研究开辟了新的研究途径，展示了个人信仰信息在改进语言模型对齐方面的潜力。

Abstract: As the adoption of language models advances, so does the need to better
represent individual users to the model. Are there aspects of an individual's
belief system that a language model can utilize for improved alignment?
Following prior research, we investigate this question in the domain of opinion
prediction by developing PrimeX, a dataset of public opinion survey data from
858 US residents with two additional sources of belief information: written
explanations from the respondents for why they hold specific opinions, and the
Primal World Belief survey for assessing respondent worldview. We provide an
extensive initial analysis of our data and show the value of belief
explanations and worldview for personalizing language models. Our results
demonstrate how the additional belief information in PrimeX can benefit both
the NLP and psychological research communities, opening up avenues for further
study.

TL;DR: PREFDISCO是一个评估框架，将静态基准转化为个性化推理任务，揭示当前LLMs在个性化推理方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM开发将任务解决和偏好对齐分离，但在需要即时个性化的人类应用中，正确解决问题不足够，还需要匹配用户偏好。

Method: 使用心理学基础的人物角色和稀疏偏好，将静态基准转化为交互式个性化任务，评估21个前沿模型在10个任务上的表现。

Result: 29.0%的简单个性化尝试比通用响应更差，而通用响应也无法有效满足个体用户需求。

Conclusion: 个性化推理需要专门开发，不能自然涌现，PREFDISCO为开发适应个体用户的系统提供了基础。

Abstract: Current large language model (LLM) development treats task-solving and
preference alignment as separate challenges, optimizing first for objective
correctness, then for alignment to aggregated human preferences. This paradigm
fails in human-facing applications where solving a problem correctly is
insufficient if the response mismatches the user's needs. This challenge
intensifies in just-in-time scenarios where no prior user interaction history
exists due to cold-start conditions or privacy constraints. LLMs need to
identify what they don't know about user preferences, strategically elicit
preference values through questioning, then adapt their reasoning processes and
responses accordingly -- a complicated chain of cognitive processes which we
term personalized reasoning. We introduce PREFDISCO, an evaluation methodology
that transforms static benchmarks into interactive personalization tasks using
psychologically-grounded personas with sparse preferences. Our framework
creates scenarios where identical questions require different reasoning chains
depending on user context, as optimal explanation approaches vary by individual
expertise and preferences while maintaining factual accuracy. Evaluation of 21
frontier models across 10 tasks reveals 29.0% of naive personalization attempts
produce worse preference alignment than generic responses, yet generic
responses also fail to serve individual user needs effectively. These findings
suggest personalized reasoning requires dedicated development rather than
emerging naturally. PREFDISCO establishes personalized reasoning as a
measurable research frontier and reveals fundamental limitations in current
LLMs' interactive capabilities, providing a foundation for developing systems
that can adapt to individual users in education, healthcare, and technical
domains where personalization is critical.

Motivation: 现有LLM去偏方法使用不同的基线和指标进行评估，导致比较不一致，且大多基于概率比较而非实际用户交互场景。

Method: 构建BiasFreeBench基准，比较8种主流去偏技术（4种提示方法和4种训练方法），在两种测试场景（多选QA和开放式多轮QA）下进行统一评估。

Result: 系统比较了提示与训练范式、模型大小以及不同训练策略对未见偏见类型的泛化能力等关键维度的去偏性能。

Conclusion: 该基准旨在为偏见缓解研究建立统一的测试平台，并将公开发布。

Abstract: Existing studies on bias mitigation methods for large language models (LLMs)
use diverse baselines and metrics to evaluate debiasing performance, leading to
inconsistent comparisons among them. Moreover, their evaluations are mostly
based on the comparison between LLMs' probabilities of biased and unbiased
contexts, which ignores the gap between such evaluations and real-world use
cases where users interact with LLMs by reading model responses and expect fair
and safe outputs rather than LLMs' probabilities. To enable consistent
evaluation across debiasing methods and bridge this gap, we introduce
BiasFreeBench, an empirical benchmark that comprehensively compares eight
mainstream bias mitigation techniques (covering four prompting-based and four
training-based methods) on two test scenarios (multi-choice QA and open-ended
multi-turn QA) by reorganizing existing datasets into a unified query-response
setting. We further introduce a response-level metric, Bias-Free Score, to
measure the extent to which LLM responses are fair, safe, and
anti-stereotypical. Debiasing performances are systematically compared and
analyzed across key dimensions: the prompting vs. training paradigm, model
size, and generalization of different training strategies to unseen bias types.
We will publicly release our benchmark, aiming to establish a unified testbed
for bias mitigation research.

Motivation: 现有的自动翻译评估指标缺乏可解释性和透明度，需要开发结合准确性和透明度的新评估方法。

Method: 利用大型推理模型的显式推理能力，采用结构化提示模板进行逐步翻译质量评估，并在不同推理深度下测试模型性能。

Result: 在系统级评估中，TASER在有无参考译文的情况下都获得了最高的软配对准确率；在段落级评估中，无参考变体在所有无参考方法中排名第一。

Conclusion: 大型推理模型在翻译质量评估方面显示出可衡量的进步，结合了改进的准确性和跨语言对的透明评估。

Abstract: We introduce TASER (Translation Assessment via Systematic Evaluation and
Reasoning), a metric that uses Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) for automated
translation quality assessment. TASER harnesses the explicit reasoning
capabilities of LRMs to conduct systematic, step-by-step evaluation of
translation quality. We evaluate TASER on the WMT24 Metrics Shared Task across
both reference-based and reference-free scenarios, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance. In system-level evaluation, TASER achieves the
highest soft pairwise accuracy in both reference-based and reference-free
settings, outperforming all existing metrics. At the segment level, TASER
maintains competitive performance with our reference-free variant ranking as
the top-performing metric among all reference-free approaches. Our experiments
reveal that structured prompting templates yield superior results with LRMs
compared to the open-ended approaches that proved optimal for traditional LLMs.
We evaluate o3, a large reasoning model from OpenAI, with varying reasoning
efforts, providing insights into the relationship between reasoning depth and
evaluation quality. The explicit reasoning process in LRMs offers
interpretability and visibility, addressing a key limitation of existing
automated metrics. Our results demonstrate that Large Reasoning Models show a

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values increasingly
relies on using other LLMs as automated judges, or ``autoraters''. However,
their reliability is limited by a foundational issue: they are trained on
discrete preference labels, forcing a single ground truth onto tasks that are
often subjective, ambiguous, or nuanced. We argue that a reliable autorater
must learn to model the full distribution of preferences defined by a target
population. In this paper, we propose a general framework for calibrating
probabilistic autoraters to any given preference distribution. We formalize the
problem and present two learning methods tailored to different data conditions:
1) a direct supervised fine-tuning for dense, probabilistic labels, and 2) a
reinforcement learning approach for sparse, binary labels. Our empirical
results show that finetuning autoraters with a distribution-matching objective
leads to verbalized probability predictions that are better aligned with the
target preference distribution, with improved calibration and significantly
lower positional bias, all while preserving performance on objective tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在文本生成任务中表现出色，但在文本分类特别是需要细微理解的修订分类任务中表现不足。传统微调方法需要大量昂贵的修订标注数据，这在社区中非常稀缺。

Method: IR-Tuning是一种即插即用的分层参数高效微调框架，基于梯度范数分布动态选择重要的LLM层进行微调，同时冻结冗余层。

Result: 实验表明IR-Tuning在多种文本修订任务上优于其他分层PEFT基线方法，实现了快速收敛、低GPU内存消耗，并在小规模修订语料上表现有效。

Conclusion: IR-Tuning为LLM在细微文本分类任务中提供了一种高效的解决方案，特别适用于标注数据稀缺的场景，在性能和资源效率之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown extraordinary success across various
text generation tasks; however, their potential for simple yet essential text
classification remains underexplored, as LLM pre-training tends to emphasize
generation over classification. While LLMs with instruction tuning can
transform classification into a generation task, they often struggle to
categorize nuanced texts. One such example is text revision, which involves
nuanced edits between pairs of texts. Although simply fine-tuning LLMs for
revision classification seems plausible, it requires a large amount of revision
annotations, which are exceptionally expensive and scarce in the community. To
address this issue, we introduce a plug-and-play layer-wise parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) framework, i.e., IR-Tuning, which fine-tunes a subset of
important LLM layers that are dynamically selected based on their gradient norm
distribution, while freezing those of redundant layers. Extensive experiments
suggest that IR-Tuning surpasses several layer-wise PEFT baselines over diverse
text revisions, while achieving fast convergence, low GPU memory consumption,
and effectiveness on small revision corpora.

Motivation: 现有阿拉伯语基准主要关注检索和理解任务，缺乏专门针对开放式多步推理的数据集，特别是在法律领域。

Method: 构建包含案件事实、法庭推理、判决结果和引用条款的数据集，定义判决预测、推理链补全和相关法规识别等任务，并对阿拉伯语LLM进行基准测试和指令微调。

Conclusion: ALARB数据集有效填补了阿拉伯语法律推理评估的空白，证明了指令微调在提升LLM法律推理能力方面的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce ALARB, a dataset and suite of tasks designed to evaluate the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) within the Arabic legal
domain. While existing Arabic benchmarks cover some knowledge-intensive tasks
such as retrieval and understanding, substantial datasets focusing specifically
on multistep reasoning for Arabic LLMs, especially in open-ended contexts, are
lacking. The dataset comprises over 13K commercial court cases from Saudi
Arabia, with each case including the facts presented, the reasoning of the
court, the verdict, as well as the cited clauses extracted from the regulatory
documents. We define a set of challenging tasks leveraging this dataset and
reflecting the complexity of real-world legal reasoning, including verdict
prediction, completion of reasoning chains in multistep legal arguments, and
identification of relevant regulations based on case facts. We benchmark a
representative selection of current open and closed Arabic LLMs on these tasks
and demonstrate the dataset's utility for instruction tuning. Notably, we show
that instruction-tuning a modest 12B parameter model using ALARB significantly
enhances its performance in verdict prediction and Arabic verdict generation,
reaching a level comparable to that of GPT-4o.

Method: 采用三步管道：LLM抽取器生成结构化实体及其上下文，字符串全局对齐器，以及评分模型。

Result: 使用该管道可将幻觉减少达85%，且与人工判断高度一致。微调的transformer编码器在标记不安全通道方面优于LLM评分模型。

Conclusion: SafePassage能有效减少LLM信息抽取中的幻觉，并可用于评估LLM性能，小规模任务特定数据微调的模型表现优异。

Abstract: Black box large language models (LLMs) make information extraction (IE) easy
to configure, but hard to trust. Unlike traditional information extraction
pipelines, the information "extracted" is not guaranteed to be grounded in the
document. To prevent this, this paper introduces the notion of a "safe
passage": context generated by the LLM that is both grounded in the document
and consistent with the extracted information. This is operationalized via a
three-step pipeline, SafePassage, which consists of: (1) an LLM extractor that
generates structured entities and their contexts from a document, (2) a
string-based global aligner, and (3) a scoring model. Results show that using
these three parts in conjunction reduces hallucinations by up to 85% on
information extraction tasks with minimal risk of flagging non-hallucinations.
High agreement between the SafePassage pipeline and human judgments of
extraction quality mean that the pipeline can be dually used to evaluate LLMs.
Surprisingly, results also show that using a transformer encoder fine-tuned on
a small number of task-specific examples can outperform an LLM scoring model at
flagging unsafe passages. These annotations can be collected in as little as
1-2 hours.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个临床基础的元评估框架，重新思考放射学报告生成评估指标的设计和评估，揭示了现有指标在临床语义解释方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动生成的放射学报告在现有评估指标上得分很高，但无法获得临床医生的信任，这揭示了当前评估指标在评估生成报告质量方面的根本缺陷。

Method: 定义临床基础标准，涵盖临床对齐和关键指标能力，包括区分度、鲁棒性和单调性。使用细粒度数据集系统评估现有指标。

Result: 发现现有指标在解释临床语义方面存在局限性，如无法区分临床显著错误、过度惩罚无害变异、在错误严重程度级别上缺乏一致性。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建更临床可靠的评估方法提供了指导。

Abstract: Automatically generated radiology reports often receive high scores from
existing evaluation metrics but fail to earn clinicians' trust. This gap
reveals fundamental flaws in how current metrics assess the quality of
generated reports. We rethink the design and evaluation of these metrics and
propose a clinically grounded Meta-Evaluation framework. We define clinically
grounded criteria spanning clinical alignment and key metric capabilities,
including discrimination, robustness, and monotonicity. Using a fine-grained
dataset of ground truth and rewritten report pairs annotated with error types,
clinical significance labels, and explanations, we systematically evaluate
existing metrics and reveal their limitations in interpreting clinical
semantics, such as failing to distinguish clinically significant errors,
over-penalizing harmless variations, and lacking consistency across error
severity levels. Our framework offers guidance for building more clinically
reliable evaluation methods.

TL;DR: 提出了可擦除强化学习(ERL)框架，通过识别、擦除和重新生成错误推理步骤，解决多跳推理中的分解错误、检索缺失和推理错误问题，显著提升了搜索增强大语言模型的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 搜索增强的大语言模型在复杂多跳推理中的可靠性有限，主要面临三个挑战：分解错误、检索缺失和推理错误，任一阶段的失败都会导致最终答案错误。

Method: 提出可擦除强化学习(ERL)框架，明确识别错误推理步骤，擦除这些步骤并重新生成推理，防止错误逻辑在推理链中传播。

Result: 在HotpotQA、MuSiQue、2Wiki和Bamboogle数据集上取得显著提升，3B模型比之前SOTA提升8.48% EM和11.56% F1，7B模型提升5.38% EM和7.22% F1。

Conclusion: 可擦除强化学习为大语言模型的鲁棒多步推理提供了强大的范式转变。

Abstract: While search-augmented large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive
capabilities, their reliability in complex multi-hop reasoning remains limited.
This limitation arises from three fundamental challenges: decomposition errors,
where tasks are incorrectly broken down; retrieval missing, where key evidence
fails to be retrieved; and reasoning errors, where flawed logic propagates
through the reasoning chain. A single failure in any of these stages can derail
the final answer. We propose Erasable Reinforcement Learning (ERL), a novel
framework that transforms fragile reasoning into a robust process. ERL
explicitly identifies faulty steps, erases them, and regenerates reasoning in
place, preventing defective logic from propagating through the reasoning chain.
This targeted correction mechanism turns brittle reasoning into a more
resilient process. Models trained with ERL, termed ESearch, achieve substantial
improvements on HotpotQA, MuSiQue, 2Wiki, and Bamboogle, with the 3B model
achieving +8.48% EM and +11.56% F1, and the 7B model achieving +5.38% EM and
+7.22% F1 over previous state-of-the-art(SOTA) results. These findings suggest
that erasable reinforcement learning provides a powerful paradigm shift for
robust multi-step reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: The proliferation of transformer-based language models has revolutionized NLP
domain while simultaneously introduced significant challenges regarding model
transparency and trustworthiness. The complexity of achieving explainable
systems in this domain is evidenced by the extensive array of explanation
methods and evaluation metrics developed by researchers. To address the
challenge of selecting optimal explainability approaches, we present
\textbf{\texttt{o-mega}}, a hyperparameter optimization tool designed to
automatically identify the most effective explainable AI methods and their
configurations within the semantic matching domain. We evaluate o-mega on a
post-claim matching pipeline using a curated dataset of social media posts
paired with refuting claims. Our tool systematically explores different
explainable methods and their hyperparameters, demonstrating improved
transparency in automated fact-checking systems. As a result, such automated
optimization of explanation methods can significantly enhance the
interpretability of claim-matching models in critical applications such as
misinformation detection, contributing to more trustworthy and transparent AI
systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CORTEX是一个多智能体LLM架构，用于安全运营中心的高风险警报分类，通过专门智能体协作处理真实证据，显著减少误报并提高调查质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 安全运营中心每天面临数万条警报，只有一小部分是真正的攻击，导致警报疲劳、威胁被忽视和分析师倦怠。传统的检测管道脆弱且缺乏上下文，而现有的LLM方法通常依赖单一模型，难以处理嘈杂的企业数据且透明度有限。

Method: 提出CORTEX多智能体LLM架构，包含专门智能体：行为分析智能体检查活动序列，证据收集智能体查询外部系统，推理智能体将发现综合为可审计的决策。

Result: 在多样化企业场景中，CORTEX相比最先进的单智能体LLM显著减少了误报并提高了调查质量。

Conclusion: 多智能体协作方法比单一LLM模型在警报分类任务中表现更优，提供了更好的透明度和处理复杂企业数据的能力。

Abstract: Security Operations Centers (SOCs) are overwhelmed by tens of thousands of
daily alerts, with only a small fraction corresponding to genuine attacks. This
overload creates alert fatigue, leading to overlooked threats and analyst
burnout. Classical detection pipelines are brittle and context-poor, while
recent LLM-based approaches typically rely on a single model to interpret logs,
retrieve context, and adjudicate alerts end-to-end -- an approach that
struggles with noisy enterprise data and offers limited transparency. We
propose CORTEX, a multi-agent LLM architecture for high-stakes alert triage in
which specialized agents collaborate over real evidence: a behavior-analysis
agent inspects activity sequences, evidence-gathering agents query external
systems, and a reasoning agent synthesizes findings into an auditable decision.
To support training and evaluation, we release a dataset of fine-grained SOC
investigations from production environments, capturing step-by-step analyst
actions and linked tool outputs. Across diverse enterprise scenarios, CORTEX
substantially reduces false positives and improves investigation quality over
state-of-the-art single-agent LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了TokMem，一种标记化程序记忆，将重复程序存储为紧凑、可训练的嵌入，为LLMs提供显式程序记忆，避免重复上下文开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型过度依赖提示来指定任务、回忆知识和指导推理，这种方式效率低下、跨任务扩展性差且缺乏模块化重用机制。

Method: 引入TokMem，每个记忆标记编码程序地址和控制信号，保持骨干模型冻结，支持持续适应，新程序添加不干扰现有程序。

Result: 在1000个原子回忆任务和函数调用任务上，TokMem持续优于检索增强生成，避免重复上下文开销，且参数远少于微调。

Conclusion: TokMem作为提示工程和微调的可扩展模块化替代方案，为LLMs提供了显式程序记忆。

Abstract: Large language models rely heavily on prompts to specify tasks, recall
knowledge and guide reasoning. However, this reliance is inefficient as prompts
must be re-read at each step, scale poorly across tasks, and lack mechanisms
for modular reuse. We introduce TokMem, a tokenized procedural memory that
stores recurring procedures as compact, trainable embeddings. Each memory token
encodes both an address to a procedure and a control signal that steers
generation, enabling targeted behavior with constant-size overhead. To support
continual adaptation, TokMem keeps the backbone model frozen, allowing new
procedures to be added without interfering with existing ones. We evaluate
TokMem on 1,000 tasks for atomic recall, and on function-calling tasks for
compositional recall, where it consistently outperforms retrieval-augmented
generation while avoiding repeated context overhead, and fine-tuning with far
fewer parameters. These results establish TokMem as a scalable and modular
alternative to prompt engineering and fine-tuning, offering an explicit
procedural memory for LLMs.

*Yuling Shi,Yichun Qian,Hongyu Zhang,Beijun Shen,Xiaodong Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongCodeZip是一个专门为代码LLMs设计的即插即用压缩框架，通过双阶段压缩策略（粗粒度函数级压缩和细粒度块级压缩）有效减少上下文大小，在保持任务性能的同时实现高达5.6倍的压缩比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs需要在代码库中处理大量信息，长上下文代码生成变得日益重要。虽然现有技术能让代码LLMs处理长输入，但高API成本和生成延迟仍是主要瓶颈。现有的上下文剪枝技术忽略了代码特定的结构和依赖关系，在编程任务中表现不佳。

Method: 采用双阶段压缩策略：1）粗粒度压缩：使用条件困惑度识别和排序函数级块，仅保留最相关的函数；2）细粒度压缩：将保留的函数基于困惑度分割成块，并在自适应token预算下选择最优子集以最大化相关性。

Result: 在代码补全、摘要和问答等多个任务上的评估显示，LongCodeZip始终优于基线方法，在不降低任务性能的情况下实现高达5.6倍的压缩比。

Conclusion: 通过有效减少上下文大小同时保留关键信息，LongCodeZip使LLMs能更好地扩展到现实世界的大规模代码场景，提升了代码智能应用的效率和能力。

Abstract: Code generation under long contexts is becoming increasingly critical as
Large Language Models (LLMs) are required to reason over extensive information
in the codebase. While recent advances enable code LLMs to process long inputs,
high API costs and generation latency remain substantial bottlenecks. Existing
context pruning techniques, such as LLMLingua, achieve promising results for
general text but overlook code-specific structures and dependencies, leading to
suboptimal performance in programming tasks. In this paper, we propose
LongCodeZip, a novel plug-and-play code compression framework designed
specifically for code LLMs. LongCodeZip employs a dual-stage strategy: (1)
coarse-grained compression, which identifies and ranks function-level chunks
using conditional perplexity with respect to the instruction, retaining only
the most relevant functions; and (2) fine-grained compression, which segments
retained functions into blocks based on perplexity and selects an optimal
subset under an adaptive token budget to maximize relevance. Evaluations across
multiple tasks, including code completion, summarization, and question
answering, show that LongCodeZip consistently outperforms baseline methods,
achieving up to a 5.6x compression ratio without degrading task performance. By
effectively reducing context size while preserving essential information,
LongCodeZip enables LLMs to better scale to real-world, large-scale code
scenarios, advancing the efficiency and capability of code intelligence
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注分类或排序任务，而忽略了需要语言和数学推理的Likert评分预测任务。该任务具有重要工业应用价值，但现成大语言模型在此领域的应用仍未被充分探索。

Method: 通过三个数据集上的八个模型进行综合实验，提供不同的上下文信息，包括用户评论和一般偏好描述，并尝试让模型首先生成假设性评论。

Result: 用户撰写的评论显著提升了LLMs的评分预测性能，效果与矩阵分解等传统方法相当。具体物品的评论比一般偏好描述更有效，首先生成假设性评论能进一步提升预测性能。

Conclusion: 现成大语言模型在评分预测任务中表现出色，用户评论是关键影响因素，为解决冷启动问题提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Personalizing the outputs of large language models (LLMs) to align with
individual user preferences is an active research area. However, previous
studies have mainly focused on classification or ranking tasks and have not
considered Likert-scale rating prediction, a regression task that requires both
language and mathematical reasoning to be solved effectively. This task has
significant industrial applications, but the utilization of LLMs remains
underexplored, particularly regarding the capabilities of off-the-shelf LLMs.
This study investigates the performance of off-the-shelf LLMs on rating
prediction, providing different in-context information. Through comprehensive
experiments with eight models across three datasets, we demonstrate that
user-written reviews significantly improve the rating prediction performance of
LLMs. This result is comparable to traditional methods like matrix
factorization, highlighting the potential of LLMs as a promising solution for
the cold-start problem. We also find that the reviews for concrete items are
more effective than general preference descriptions that are not based on any
specific item. Furthermore, we discover that prompting LLMs to first generate a
hypothetical review enhances the rating prediction performance. Our code is
available at https://github.com/ynklab/rating-prediction-with-reviews.

Result: 在JP1认证考试问题上，该方法比基础模型性能提升14%，显著提高了决策准确性和搜索效率。

Conclusion: 智能体微调在复杂微领域中具有巨大潜力，能够有效提升领域特定推理能力。

Abstract: Agentic large language models (LLMs) have become prominent for autonomously
interacting with external environments and performing multi-step reasoning
tasks. Most approaches leverage these capabilities via in-context learning with
few-shot prompts, but this often results in lengthy inputs and higher
computational costs. Agent fine-tuning offers an alternative by enabling LLMs
to internalize procedural reasoning and domain-specific knowledge through
training on relevant data and demonstration trajectories. While prior studies
have focused on general domains, their effectiveness in specialized technical
microdomains remains unclear. This paper explores agent fine-tuning for domain
adaptation within Hitachi's JP1 middleware, a microdomain for specialized IT
operations. We fine-tuned LLMs using JP1-specific datasets derived from domain
manuals and distilled reasoning trajectories generated by LLMs themselves,
enhancing decision making accuracy and search efficiency. During inference, we
used an agentic prompt with retrieval-augmented generation and introduced a
context-answer extractor to improve information relevance. On JP1 certification
exam questions, our method achieved a 14% performance improvement over the base
model, demonstrating the potential of agent fine-tuning for domain-specific
reasoning in complex microdomains.

Method: 提出Agent-ScanKit系统探测框架，包含视觉引导、文本引导和结构引导三种正交探测范式，在不访问模型内部的情况下量化记忆和推理贡献。

Result: 在5个公开GUI基准测试和18个多模态代理中，发现机械记忆往往超过系统推理，大多数模型主要作为训练对齐知识的检索器，泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在现实场景中为多模态代理开发强大推理模型的必要性，为可靠多模态代理的发展提供了宝贵见解。

Abstract: Although numerous strategies have recently been proposed to enhance the
autonomous interaction capabilities of multimodal agents in graphical user
interface (GUI), their reliability remains limited when faced with complex or
out-of-domain tasks. This raises a fundamental question: Are existing
multimodal agents reasoning spuriously? In this paper, we propose
\textbf{Agent-ScanKit}, a systematic probing framework to unravel the memory
and reasoning capabilities of multimodal agents under controlled perturbations.
Specifically, we introduce three orthogonal probing paradigms: visual-guided,
text-guided, and structure-guided, each designed to quantify the contributions
of memorization and reasoning without requiring access to model internals. In
five publicly available GUI benchmarks involving 18 multimodal agents, the
results demonstrate that mechanical memorization often outweighs systematic
reasoning. Most of the models function predominantly as retrievers of
training-aligned knowledge, exhibiting limited generalization. Our findings
underscore the necessity of robust reasoning modeling for multimodal agents in
real-world scenarios, offering valuable insights toward the development of
reliable multimodal agents.

Motivation: 传统级联语音系统丢弃副语言线索且限制表达能力，现有端到端方法虽减少延迟但仍依赖文本中间体，造成根本瓶颈。

Method: 采用基于模态的层分割架构和冻结预训练策略，在保留预训练文本LLM推理能力和知识的同时添加原生语音能力。

Result: 在口语问答任务上达到最先进结果，在语音到语音性能上与现有文本引导系统相当，同时保持竞争力的文本性能。

Conclusion: 通过缩小文本引导与直接语音生成之间的差距，为表达性和高效的端到端语音交互建立了新范式。

Abstract: Spoken dialogue systems often rely on cascaded pipelines that transcribe,
process, and resynthesize speech. While effective, this design discards
paralinguistic cues and limits expressivity. Recent end-to-end methods reduce
latency and better preserve these cues, yet still rely on text intermediates,
creating a fundamental bottleneck. We present MOSS-Speech, a true
speech-to-speech large language model that directly understands and generates
speech without relying on text guidance. Our approach combines a modality-based
layer-splitting architecture with a frozen pre-training strategy, preserving
the reasoning and knowledge of pretrained text LLMs while adding native speech
capabilities. Experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results
in spoken question answering and delivers comparable speech-to-speech
performance relative to existing text-guided systems, while still maintaining
competitive text performance. By narrowing the gap between text-guided and
direct speech generation, our work establishes a new paradigm for expressive
and efficient end-to-end speech interaction.

TL;DR: Graph2Eval是一个基于知识图谱的框架，能够自动生成多模态文档理解和网页交互任务，用于全面评估智能体的推理、协作和交互能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态LLM驱动的智能体在自主性和泛化能力上的进步，基于静态数据集的评估已无法充分评估其在动态环境和多样化任务中的真实能力。现有的LLM合成数据方法主要针对LLM训练和评估设计，无法直接应用于需要工具使用和交互能力的智能体任务。

Method: 使用从多源外部数据构建的知识图谱作为任务空间，通过子图采样、任务模板和元路径将语义关系转化为结构化多模态任务。采用基于节点可达性、LLM评分和相似性分析的多阶段过滤管道来保证生成任务的质量和可执行性。

Result: 构建了Graph2Eval-Bench数据集，包含1,319个涵盖文档理解和网页交互场景的任务。实验表明Graph2Eval能有效生成区分智能体和模型性能的任务，揭示了不同设置下推理、协作和网页交互能力的差距。

Conclusion: Graph2Eval为智能体评估提供了新视角，能够全面评估多类型智能体（单智能体、多智能体、网页智能体）的推理、协作和交互能力。

Abstract: As multimodal LLM-driven agents continue to advance in autonomy and
generalization, evaluation based on static datasets can no longer adequately
assess their true capabilities in dynamic environments and diverse tasks.
Existing LLM-based synthetic data methods are largely designed for LLM training
and evaluation, and thus cannot be directly applied to agent tasks that require
tool use and interactive capabilities. While recent studies have explored
automatic agent task generation with LLMs, most efforts remain limited to text
or image analysis, without systematically modeling multi-step interactions in
web environments. To address these challenges, we propose Graph2Eval, a
knowledge graph-based framework that automatically generates both multimodal
document comprehension tasks and web interaction tasks, enabling comprehensive
evaluation of agents' reasoning, collaboration, and interactive capabilities.
In our approach, knowledge graphs constructed from multi-source external data
serve as the task space, where we translate semantic relations into structured
multimodal tasks using subgraph sampling, task templates, and meta-paths. A
multi-stage filtering pipeline based on node reachability, LLM scoring, and
similarity analysis is applied to guarantee the quality and executability of
the generated tasks. Furthermore, Graph2Eval supports end-to-end evaluation of
multiple agent types (Single-Agent, Multi-Agent, Web Agent) and measures
reasoning, collaboration, and interaction capabilities. We instantiate the
framework with Graph2Eval-Bench, a curated dataset of 1,319 tasks spanning
document comprehension and web interaction scenarios. Experiments show that
Graph2Eval efficiently generates tasks that differentiate agent and model
performance, revealing gaps in reasoning, collaboration, and web interaction
across different settings and offering a new perspective for agent evaluation.

TL;DR: CopyPasteLLM通过两阶段高复制响应偏好训练，增强LLM对上下文的信任度，显著减少幻觉问题。该方法仅需365个训练样本，在FaithEval等基准上比最佳基线提升12.2%-24.5%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG系统中LLM不信任提供上下文导致的幻觉问题，观察到响应复制程度与上下文不忠实幻觉呈负相关。

Method: 设计三种提示方法增强复制程度，通过两阶段高复制响应偏好训练获得CopyPasteLLM，使用Context-Parameter Copying Capturing算法分析机制。

Result: 在FaithEval、ConFiQA和PubMedQA上取得最佳性能，仅需365个训练样本（基线数据的1/50），在FaithEval上比最佳基线提升12.2%-24.5%准确率。

Conclusion: CopyPasteLLM通过重新校准对内部参数知识的依赖而非外部知识来增强上下文忠实度，提供了一种高效减少幻觉的方法。

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models
(LLMs) to generate contextually grounded responses, contextual faithfulness
remains challenging as LLMs may not consistently trust provided context,
leading to hallucinations that undermine reliability. We observe an inverse
correlation between response copying degree and context-unfaithful
hallucinations on RAGTruth, suggesting that higher copying degrees reduce
hallucinations by fostering genuine contextual belief. We propose CopyPasteLLM,
obtained through two-stage high-copying response preference training. We design
three prompting methods to enhance copying degree, demonstrating that
high-copying responses achieve superior contextual faithfulness and
hallucination control. These approaches enable a fully automated pipeline that
transforms generated responses into high-copying preference data for training
CopyPasteLLM. On FaithEval, ConFiQA and PubMedQA, CopyPasteLLM achieves best
performance in both counterfactual and original contexts, remarkably with 12.2%
to 24.5% accuracy improvements on FaithEval over the best baseline, while
requiring only 365 training samples -- 1/50th of baseline data. To elucidate
CopyPasteLLM's effectiveness, we propose the Context-Parameter Copying
Capturing algorithm. Interestingly, this reveals that CopyPasteLLM recalibrates
reliance on internal parametric knowledge rather than external knowledge during
generation. All codes are available at

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents for
complex real-world tasks, yet existing systems often focus on isolated
improvements without a unifying design for robustness and adaptability. We
propose a generalist agent architecture that integrates three core components:
a collective multi-agent framework combining planning and execution agents with
critic model voting, a hierarchical memory system spanning working, semantic,

multimodal parsing. Evaluated on a comprehensive benchmark, our framework
consistently outperforms open-source baselines and approaches the performance
of proprietary systems. These results demonstrate the importance of

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种从议会录音构建语音数据集的可扩展流程，解决了多语言语音处理中数据不足的问题，在22个欧洲议会中提取了超过61k小时的高质量语音数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多语言数据集对大多数语言包含的数据不足，导致训练模型在多数支持语言上表现不佳。

Method: 开发了包含媒体检索和两阶段对齐算法的可扩展流程，专门处理非逐字转录和长音频。

Result: 从22个欧洲议会提取了61k+小时对齐语音片段，19种语言超过1k小时，22种语言超过500小时，微调现有ASR模型后词错误率平均降低41.8%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多语言语音数据稀缺问题，显著提升了语音识别性能。

Abstract: Recent progress in speech processing has highlighted that high-quality
performance across languages requires substantial training data for each
individual language. While existing multilingual datasets cover many languages,
they often contain insufficient data for most languages. Thus, trained models
perform poorly on the majority of the supported languages. Our work addresses
this challenge by introducing a scalable pipeline for constructing speech
datasets from parliamentary recordings. The proposed pipeline includes robust
components for media retrieval and a two-stage alignment algorithm designed to
handle non-verbatim transcripts and long-form audio. Applying this pipeline to
recordings from 22 European parliaments, we extract over 61k hours of aligned
speech segments, achieving substantial per-language coverage with 19 languages
exceeding 1k hours and 22 languages exceeding 500 hours of high-quality speech
data. We obtain an average 41.8\% reduction in word error rates over baselines
when finetuning an existing ASR model on our dataset, demonstrating the
usefulness of our approach.

*Gaotang Li,Ruizhong Qiu,Xiusi Chen,Heng Ji,Hanghang Tong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究发现，在大型语言模型的后训练阶段，传统的负对数似然(NLL)目标函数在模型能力较强时表现不佳，提出了基于概率的目标函数家族，发现在模型能力连续谱上不同目标函数各有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调(SFT)是后训练LLM的标准方法，但其泛化能力有限。作者认为这是因为NLL目标在后训练阶段可能不再是最优的，因为此时模型已经编码了任务相关的先验知识，且监督信号可能冗长且嘈杂。

Method: 研究了一类基于概率的目标函数家族，通过7个模型主干、14个基准测试和3个领域的综合实验和消融研究，分析了这些目标函数在不同条件下的有效性。

Result: 发现模型能力连续谱是决定目标函数效果的关键维度：在模型能力强的一端，倾向于先验的目标函数(如$-p$, $-p^{10}$及其阈值变体)持续优于NLL；在模型能力弱的一端，NLL占主导；在中间区域，没有单一目标函数占优。

Conclusion: 理论分析阐明了目标函数在连续谱上的权衡关系，为根据模型能力自适应选择目标函数提供了理论基础。不同模型能力阶段应使用不同的训练目标函数。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is the standard approach for post-training large
language models (LLMs), yet it often shows limited generalization. We trace
this limitation to its default training objective: negative log likelihood
(NLL). While NLL is classically optimal when training from scratch,
post-training operates in a different paradigm and could violate its optimality
assumptions, where models already encode task-relevant priors and supervision
can be long and noisy. To this end, we study a general family of
probability-based objectives and characterize their effectiveness under
different conditions. Through comprehensive experiments and extensive ablation
studies across 7 model backbones, 14 benchmarks, and 3 domains, we uncover a
critical dimension that governs objective behavior: the model-capability
continuum. Near the model-strong end, prior-leaning objectives that downweight
low-probability tokens (e.g., $-p$, $-p^{10}$, thresholded variants)
consistently outperform NLL; toward the model-weak end, NLL dominates; in
between, no single objective prevails. Our theoretical analysis further
elucidates how objectives trade places across the continuum, providing a
principled foundation for adapting objectives to model capability. Our code is
available at https://github.com/GaotangLi/Beyond-Log-Likelihood.

*Kung-Hsiang Huang,Haoyi Qiu,Yutong Dai,Caiming Xiong,Chien-Sheng Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出GUI-KV方法，一种无需重新训练的KV缓存压缩技术，专门针对GUI代理中的空间和时间冗余进行优化，显著减少计算开销同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI代理处理高分辨率截图序列时面临效率挑战，现有缓存压缩方法未能充分考虑GUI特有的空间和时间冗余特性。

Method: 结合两种新技术：空间显著性指导（通过隐藏状态L2范数增强注意力分数）和时间冗余评分（将历史帧键投影到当前帧键子空间），采用统一的预算分配策略。

Result: 在标准GUI代理基准测试中，GUI-KV优于现有KV压缩基线，在AgentNetBench基准上减少38.9%解码FLOPs同时提高4.1%步骤准确率。

Conclusion: 利用GUI特定冗余可以实现高效可靠的代理性能，GUI-KV在适度预算下接近全缓存准确率。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents built on vision-language models have
emerged as a promising approach to automate human-computer workflows. However,
they also face the inefficiency challenge as they process long sequences of
high-resolution screenshots and solving long-horizon tasks, making inference
slow, costly and memory-bound. While key-value (KV) caching can mitigate this,
storing the full cache is prohibitive for image-heavy contexts. Existing
cache-compression methods are sub-optimal as they do not account for the
spatial and temporal redundancy of GUIs. In this work, we first analyze
attention patterns in GUI agent workloads and find that, unlike in natural
images, attention sparsity is uniformly high across all transformer layers.
This insight motivates a simple uniform budget allocation strategy, which we
show empirically outperforms more complex layer-varying schemes. Building on
this, we introduce GUI-KV, a plug-and-play KV cache compression method for GUI
agents that requires no retraining. GUI-KV combines two novel techniques: (i)
spatial saliency guidance, which augments attention scores with the L2 norm of
hidden states to better preserve semantically important visual tokens, and (ii)
temporal redundancy scoring, which projects previous frames' keys onto the
current frame's key subspace to preferentially prune redundant history. Across
standard GUI agent benchmarks and models, GUI-KV outperforms competitive KV
compression baselines, closely matching full-cache accuracy at modest budgets.
Notably, in a 5-screenshot setting on the AgentNetBench benchmark, GUI-KV
reduces decoding FLOPs by 38.9% while increasing step accuracy by 4.1% over the
full-cache baseline. These results demonstrate that exploiting GUI-specific
redundancies enables efficient and reliable agent performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 小推理模型在工具使用时存在过度思考问题，本文提出ThinkBrake方法通过监控句子边界处的概率差异来提前终止推理，在保持准确性的同时显著减少推理长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小推理模型在工具使用中经常过度思考：它们已经达到正确的工具参数配置，但继续推理并用错误的最终调用覆盖它。这种过度思考导致准确率下降和推理冗余。

Method: 通过oracle rollout诊断过度思考问题，提出ThinkBrake训练无关的解码启发式方法，监控句子边界处</think>与当前top token之间的对数概率差异，当差异变小时触发终止。

Result: 在Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard上，oracle终止将平均准确率从85.8%提升到94.2%，同时减少80-94%的token。ThinkBrake在三个测试集上保持或提高准确率的同时减少最多25%的token。

Conclusion: 工具推理中的过度思考问题显著，ThinkBrake方法能有效缓解这一问题，在保持性能的同时大幅减少推理成本，为小推理模型的工具使用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Small reasoning models (SRMs) often overthink during tool use: they reach a
correct tool-argument configuration, then continue reasoning and overwrite it
with an incorrect final call. We diagnose overthinking via oracle rollouts that
inject </think> at sentence boundaries. On the Berkeley Function Calling
Leaderboard (BFCL), this oracle termination lifts average accuracy from 85.8\%
to 94.2\% while reducing tokens by 80-94\%, revealing substantial recoverable
headroom and potential redundant reasoning. While prior work on concise
reasoning has largely targeted mathematics, tool reasoning remains
underexplored. We adapt various early-termination baselines to tool use and
introduce ThinkBrake, a training-free decoding heuristic. ThinkBrake monitors
the log-probability margin between </think> and the current top token at
sentence boundaries and triggers termination when this margin becomes small.
Across BFCL's single turn, non-live and live splits, ThinkBrake preserves or
improves accuracy while reducing tokens up to 25\%, outperforming various
baselines.

TL;DR: CHIME是一个中文网络梗解释数据集，评估大语言模型对网络流行梗的理解能力。研究发现LLMs能解释部分梗的含义，但在文化语言细节和起源追溯方面表现不佳，且整体性能低于人类水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型是否真正理解网络上快速传播的病毒性内容——网络梗，特别是中文网络环境中的流行梗。

Method: 构建CHIME数据集，包含中文网络流行短语梗及其详细注释；设计两个评估任务：梗解释任务（包括含义解释、起源追溯和例句生成）和选择题任务（在上下文句子中选择合适梗填空）。

Result: LLMs能解释部分梗的含义，但对文化和语言细节丰富的梗类型表现显著下降；在追溯梗起源方面持续困难；选择题任务中表现虽正确但明显低于人类水平。

Conclusion: 大语言模型对网络梗的理解能力有限，特别是在文化背景和起源信息方面存在明显不足，需要进一步研究提升计算模型对网络文化的理解能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on vast amounts of text from the
Internet, but do they truly understand the viral content that rapidly spreads
online -- commonly known as memes? In this paper, we introduce CHIME, a dataset
for CHinese Internet Meme Explanation. The dataset comprises popular
phrase-based memes from the Chinese Internet, annotated with detailed
information on their meaning, origin, example sentences, types, etc. To
evaluate whether LLMs understand these memes, we designed two tasks. In the
first task, we assessed the models' ability to explain a given meme, identify
its origin, and generate appropriate example sentences. The results show that
while LLMs can explain the meanings of some memes, their performance declines
significantly for culturally and linguistically nuanced meme types.
Additionally, they consistently struggle to provide accurate origins for the
memes. In the second task, we created a set of multiple-choice questions (MCQs)
requiring LLMs to select the most appropriate meme to fill in a blank within a
contextual sentence. While the evaluated models were able to provide correct
answers, their performance remains noticeably below human levels. We have made
CHIME public and hope it will facilitate future research on computational meme
understanding.

TL;DR: ReSeek是一个用于训练搜索代理的自我纠正框架，通过引入自我纠正机制和密集的过程奖励函数，使代理能够在搜索过程中动态识别和纠正错误路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于强化学习的搜索代理方法依赖稀疏或基于规则的奖励，导致代理容易陷入次优或错误的推理路径而无法恢复。

Method: 提出ReSeek框架，包含自我纠正机制（通过JUDGE动作判断信息并重新规划搜索策略）和密集的过程奖励函数（分解为正确性奖励和效用奖励），并使用新基准FictionalHot进行训练。

Result: 实验表明，使用ReSeek训练的代理在任务成功率和路径忠实度方面显著优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: ReSeek框架通过自我纠正机制和密集奖励设计，有效提升了搜索代理在复杂推理任务中的性能，解决了现有方法中路径错误无法恢复的问题。

Abstract: Search agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
significant potential in tackling knowledge-intensive tasks. Reinforcement
learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training these agents to
perform complex, multi-step reasoning. However, prior RL-based methods often
rely on sparse or rule-based rewards, which can lead agents to commit to
suboptimal or erroneous reasoning paths without the ability to recover. To
address these limitations, we propose ReSeek, a novel self-correcting framework
for training search agents. Our framework introduces a self-correction
mechanism that empowers the agent to dynamically identify and recover from
erroneous search paths during an episode. By invoking a special JUDGE action,
the agent can judge the information and re-plan its search strategy. To guide
this process, we design a dense, instructive process reward function, which
decomposes into a correctness reward for retrieving factual information and a
utility reward for finding information genuinely useful for the query.
Furthermore, to mitigate the risk of data contamination in existing datasets,
we introduce FictionalHot, a new and challenging benchmark with recently
curated questions requiring complex reasoning. Being intuitively reasonable and
practically simple, extensive experiments show that agents trained with ReSeek
significantly outperform SOTA baselines in task success rate and path
faithfulness.

Motivation: 现有思维链提示方法（如上下文学习和微调）成本高且效率低，需要开发更经济高效的推理增强方法。

Method: 引入CoT向量作为任务通用多步推理知识的紧凑表示，提出可学习CoT向量在教师-学生框架下优化，解决层间不稳定性问题。

Result: 在多样化基准测试和模型中，CoT向量不仅优于现有基线，而且性能接近参数高效微调方法，同时需要更少的可训练参数。

Conclusion: CoT向量为LLM多步推理提供了经济高效的解决方案，并作为探针揭示了推理功能组织的新见解。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a powerful approach to
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
existing implementations, such as in-context learning and fine-tuning, remain
costly and inefficient. To improve CoT reasoning at a lower cost, and inspired
by the task vector paradigm, we introduce CoT Vectors, compact representations
that encode task-general, multi-step reasoning knowledge. Through experiments
with Extracted CoT Vectors, we observe pronounced layer-wise instability,
manifesting as a U-shaped performance curve that reflects a systematic
three-stage reasoning process in LLMs. To address this limitation, we propose
Learnable CoT Vectors, optimized under a teacher-student framework to provide
more stable and robust guidance. Extensive evaluations across diverse
benchmarks and models demonstrate that CoT Vectors not only outperform existing
baselines but also achieve performance comparable to parameter-efficient
fine-tuning methods, while requiring fewer trainable parameters. Moreover, by
treating CoT Vectors as a probe, we uncover how their effectiveness varies due
to latent space structure, information density, acquisition mechanisms, and
pre-training differences, offering new insights into the functional
organization of multi-step reasoning in LLMs. The source code will be released.

Conclusion: 该工作不仅推进了语言识别研究，还为代码切换语音技术建立了基础框架

Abstract: In this paper, we present a neural spoken language diarization model that
supports an unconstrained span of languages within a single framework. Our
approach integrates a learnable query-based architecture grounded in
multilingual awareness, with large-scale pretraining on simulated
code-switching data. By jointly leveraging these two components, our method
overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches in data scarcity and
architecture optimization, and generalizes effectively to real-world
multilingual settings across diverse environments. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several
language diarization benchmarks, with a relative performance improvement of 23%
to 52% over previous methods. We believe that this work not only advances
research in language diarization but also establishes a foundational framework
for code-switching speech technologies.

Motivation: Tenyidie是那加兰邦的一种低资源藏缅语系语言，目前尚无音节化相关研究。音节化是NLP中重要的基础任务，对形态分析、词性标注等应用至关重要。

Method: 创建了10,120个音节化Tenyidie词汇数据集，应用了LSTM、BLSTM、BLSTM+CRF和编码器-解码器等深度学习架构，数据集按80:10:10划分训练/验证/测试集。

Result: 在测试集上，BLSTM模型取得了99.21%的最高准确率，表明深度学习模型在Tenyidie音节化任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 这项工作为Tenyidie语言提供了首个音节化数据集和模型，将为该语言的形态分析、词性标注、机器翻译等NLP应用奠定基础。

Abstract: The Tenyidie language is a low-resource language of the Tibeto-Burman family
spoken by the Tenyimia Community of Nagaland in the north-eastern part of India
and is considered a major language in Nagaland. It is tonal,
Subject-Object-Verb, and highly agglutinative in nature. Being a low-resource
language, very limited research on Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been
conducted. To the best of our knowledge, no work on syllabification has been
reported for this language. Among the many NLP tasks, syllabification or
syllabication is an important task in which the given word syllables are
identified. The contribution of this work is the creation of 10,120 syllabified
Tenyidie words and the application of the Deep Learning techniques on the
created corpus. In this paper, we have applied LSTM, BLSTM, BLSTM+CRF, and
Encoder-decoder deep learning architectures on our created dataset. In our
dataset split of 80:10:10 (train:validation:test) set, we achieved the highest
accuracy of 99.21% with BLSTM model on the test set. This work will find its
application in numerous other NLP applications, such as morphological analysis,
part-of-speech tagging, machine translation, etc, for the Tenyidie Language.

TL;DR: 提出MCM-DPO方法改进替代文本生成，通过多维度偏好优化解决用户标注噪声问题，无需精确标注即可学习偏好选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 替代文本生成存在用户标注噪声、标准不一致和MLLM对上下文信息不敏感的问题，传统SFT方法依赖准确标注但用户生成数据往往存在缺陷。

Method: 提出多模态直接偏好优化(MCM-DPO)，在单维度、配对和多偏好维度上优化偏好，涵盖文本、视觉和跨模态因素，无需精确标注。

Result: MCM-DPO方法在替代文本生成任务中持续优于DPO和SFT，建立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: MCM-DPO通过多维度偏好优化有效解决了替代文本生成中的标注质量问题，构建了两个大规模高质量数据集支持进一步研究。

Abstract: The alt-text generation task produces concise, context-relevant descriptions
of images, enabling blind and low-vision users to access online images. Despite
the capabilities of large vision-language models, alt-text generation
performance remains limited due to noisy user annotations, inconsistent
standards, and MLLMs' insensitivity to contextual information. Previous efforts
to fine-tune MLLMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) have struggled, as SFT
relies on accurate target annotations, which are often flawed in user-generated
alt-text. To address this, we propose Multi-faceted Cross-modal Direct
Preference Optimization (MCM-DPO), which improves alt-text generation by
learning to identify better options in preference pairs without requiring
precise annotations. MCM-DPO optimizes preferences across single, paired, and
multi-preference dimensions, covering textual, visual, and cross-modal factors.
In light of the scarcity of high-quality annotated and preference-labeled
datasets for alt-text, we constructed two large-scale, high-quality datasets
named TAlt and PAlt, sourced from Twitter and Pinterest. These datasets include
202k annotated alt-text samples and 18k preference pairs that cover diverse
preference dimensions, aiming to support further research in this domain.
Experimental results show that our proposed MCM-DPO method consistently
outperforms both DPO and SFT, establishing a new state of the art in alt-text
generation. We release the code and data here:

Motivation: 简化复杂文本对于确保信息公平获取至关重要，特别是对认知障碍人群。易读文本的手动创建耗时且资源密集，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 提出多任务学习方法，联合训练文本摘要、文本简化和易读文本生成任务。探索了基于检索增强生成的上下文学习策略和基于LoRA的参数高效微调策略。

Result: 基于新构建的高质量数据集ETR-fr的实验表明，多任务设置在所有配置下都优于单任务基线。RAG策略在跨域设置中表现出泛化能力，而MTL-LoRA在域内配置中优于所有学习策略。

Conclusion: 多任务学习框架能有效提升易读文本的自动生成质量，不同策略在不同场景下各有优势，为易读文本的自动化生成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Simplifying complex texts is essential for ensuring equitable access to
information, especially for individuals with cognitive impairments. The
Easy-to-Read (ETR) initiative offers a framework for making content accessible
to the neurodivergent population, but the manual creation of such texts remains
time-consuming and resource-intensive. In this work, we investigate the
potential of large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of ETR
content. To address the scarcity of aligned corpora and the specificity of ETR
constraints, we propose a multi-task learning (MTL) approach that trains models
jointly on text summarization, text simplification, and ETR generation. We
explore two different strategies: multi-task retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) for in-context learning, and MTL-LoRA for parameter-efficient
fine-tuning. Our experiments with Mistral-7B and LLaMA-3-8B, based on ETR-fr, a
new high-quality dataset, demonstrate the benefits of multi-task setups over
single-task baselines across all configurations. Moreover, results show that
the RAG-based strategy enables generalization in out-of-domain settings, while
MTL-LoRA outperforms all learning strategies within in-domain configurations.

Abstract: Ensuring accessibility for individuals with cognitive impairments is
essential for autonomy, self-determination, and full citizenship. However,
manual Easy-to-Read (ETR) text adaptations are slow, costly, and difficult to
scale, limiting access to crucial information in healthcare, education, and
civic life. AI-driven ETR generation offers a scalable solution but faces key
challenges, including dataset scarcity, domain adaptation, and balancing
lightweight learning of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we
introduce ETR-fr, the first dataset for ETR text generation fully compliant
with European ETR guidelines. We implement parameter-efficient fine-tuning on
PLMs and LLMs to establish generative baselines. To ensure high-quality and
accessible outputs, we introduce an evaluation framework based on automatic
metrics supplemented by human assessments. The latter is conducted using a
36-question evaluation form that is aligned with the guidelines. Overall
results show that PLMs perform comparably to LLMs and adapt effectively to
out-of-domain texts.

Motivation: 解决低资源语言法罗语的LLM适配问题，探索从相关高资源语言迁移学习的方法，并比较不同微调策略的效果。

Method: 从英语模型开始，在相关斯堪的纳维亚语言（单独或合并）上继续预训练，然后对法罗语进行微调，比较全参数微调和LoRA方法，构建新的法罗语评估基准并进行人工评估。

Result: 相关语言迁移至关重要，但最佳源语言因任务而异：冰岛语提高语言准确性，丹麦语提升理解能力；LoRA在基础模型上提高语言可接受性和人工评估分数，全参数微调在理解能力和下游任务微调中表现更好。

Conclusion: 法罗语LLM适配需要任务特定的策略选择，相关语言迁移是有效的，但微调方法的选择应根据具体任务需求来决定。

Abstract: We investigate how to adapt small, efficient LLMs to Faroese, a low-resource
North Germanic language. Starting from English models, we continue pre-training
on related Scandinavian languages, either individually or combined via merging,
before fine-tuning on Faroese. We compare full fine-tuning with
parameter-efficient tuning using LoRA, evaluating their impact on both
linguistic accuracy and text comprehension. Due to the lack of existing Faroese
evaluation data, we construct two new minimal-pair benchmarks from adapted and
newly collected datasets and complement them with human evaluations by Faroese
linguists. Our results demonstrate that transfer from related languages is
crucial, though the optimal source language depends on the task: Icelandic
enhances linguistic accuracy, whereas Danish boosts comprehension. Similarly,
the choice between full fine-tuning and LoRA is task-dependent: LoRA improves
linguistic acceptability and slightly increases human evaluation scores on the
base model, while full fine-tuning yields stronger comprehension performance
and better preserves model capabilities during downstream fine-tuning.

Method: 提出噪声合成框架和新指标，使用Qwen系列模型（标准LLM和大推理模型）在不同资源语言对上测试习语翻译性能。

Result: 低资源语言对在噪声下退化更严重，大推理模型没有纠错改进反而更容易合理化错误上下文，注意力从源习语转向噪声内容。

Conclusion: 当前方法存在局限性，需要自验证集成机制，训练无关和微调策略能提高鲁棒性但会牺牲干净环境下的性能。

Abstract: \textbf{RE}trieval-\textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{L}LM-based \textbf{M}achine
\textbf{T}ranslation (REAL-MT) shows promise for knowledge-intensive tasks like
idiomatic translation, but its reliability under noisy retrieval contexts
remains poorly understood despite this being a common challenge in real-world
deployment. To address this gap, we propose a noise synthesis framework and new
metrics to evaluate the robustness of REAL-MT systematically. Using this
framework, we instantiate REAL-MT with Qwen-series models, including standard
LLMs and large reasoning models (LRMs) with enhanced reasoning, and evaluate
their performance on idiomatic translation across high-, medium-, and
low-resource language pairs under synthesized noise. Our results show that
low-resource language pairs, which rely more heavily on retrieved context,
degrade more severely under noise than high-resource ones and often produce
nonsensical translations. Although LRMs possess enhanced reasoning
capabilities, they show no improvement in error correction and are even more
susceptible to noise, tending to rationalize incorrect contexts. We find that
this stems from an attention shift away from the source idiom to noisy content,
while confidence increases despite declining accuracy, indicating poor
calibration. To mitigate these issues, we investigate training-free and
fine-tuning strategies, which improve robustness at the cost of performance in
clean contexts, revealing a fundamental trade-off. Our findings highlight the
limitations of current approaches, underscoring the need for self-verifying
integration mechanisms.

*Adi Simhi,Jonathan Herzig,Martin Tutek,Itay Itzhak,Idan Szpektor,Yonatan Belinkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ManagerBench是一个评估LLM在管理场景中安全决策能力的基准测试，重点关注操作目标与人类安全冲突时的权衡选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全基准主要关注防止生成有害内容，但忽视了当实现操作目标的最有效路径与人类安全冲突时，代理可能采取有害行动的问题。

Method: 创建包含人类验证的管理场景，每个场景都要求在实现操作目标的实用但有害行动与安全但操作性能较差的行为之间做出选择，并设置平行控制组来测量模型的实用主义倾向。

Result: 前沿LLM在安全-实用权衡方面表现不佳，许多模型为了推进操作目标而持续选择有害选项，而其他模型则过度安全且无效。模型能够准确感知危害，但存在优先级排序缺陷。

Conclusion: ManagerBench是评估代理行为核心组件（在操作目标和对齐价值激励冲突行动时做出安全选择）的具有挑战性的基准。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve from conversational assistants into
autonomous agents, evaluating the safety of their actions becomes critical.
Prior safety benchmarks have primarily focused on preventing generation of
harmful content, such as toxic text. However, they overlook the challenge of
agents taking harmful actions when the most effective path to an operational
goal conflicts with human safety. To address this gap, we introduce
ManagerBench, a benchmark that evaluates LLM decision-making in realistic,
human-validated managerial scenarios. Each scenario forces a choice between a
pragmatic but harmful action that achieves an operational goal, and a safe
action that leads to worse operational performance. A parallel control set,
where potential harm is directed only at inanimate objects, measures a model's
pragmatism and identifies its tendency to be overly safe. Our findings indicate
that the frontier LLMs perform poorly when navigating this safety-pragmatism
trade-off. Many consistently choose harmful options to advance their
operational goals, while others avoid harm only to become overly safe and
ineffective. Critically, we find this misalignment does not stem from an
inability to perceive harm, as models' harm assessments align with human
judgments, but from flawed prioritization. ManagerBench is a challenging
benchmark for a core component of agentic behavior: making safe choices when
operational goals and alignment values incentivize conflicting actions.

*Loris Bergeron,Ioana Buhnila,Jérôme François,Radu State*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HalluGuard是一个40亿参数的小型推理模型，专门用于缓解检索增强生成中的幻觉问题，通过分类文档-声明对并提供证据解释，在保持较小模型规模的同时达到与更大模型相当的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在NLP任务中表现出色但容易产生幻觉，限制了在实际应用中的可信度，需要开发专门针对幻觉检测的轻量级解决方案。

Method: 结合领域无关的合成数据集、合成的基础和幻觉声明，以及使用几率比偏好优化的偏好微调方法，将大模型推理能力蒸馏到小型骨干网络中。

Result: 在RAGTruth子集上达到84.0%的平衡准确率，与专门模型MiniCheck和Granite Guardian 3.3相当但参数减半；在整个基准测试上达到75.7%平衡准确率，与GPT-4o相当。

Conclusion: HalluGuard证明了通过精心设计的数据合成和偏好优化方法，可以构建参数效率高但性能强大的幻觉检测模型，为实际应用提供了可行的轻量级解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in many NLP tasks but remain prone to
hallucinations, limiting trust in real-world applications. We present
HalluGuard, a 4B-parameter Small Reasoning Model (SRM) for mitigating
hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). HalluGuard classifies
document-claim pairs as grounded or hallucinated and produces evidence-grounded
justifications for transparency. Our approach combines (i) a domain-agnostic
synthetic dataset derived from FineWeb and refined through multi-stage curation
and data reformation, (ii) synthetic grounded and hallucinated claims, and
(iii) preference-based fine-tuning with Odds Ratio Preference Optimization to
distill large-model reasoning into a smaller backbone. On the RAGTruth subset
of the LLM-AggreFact benchmark, HalluGuard achieves 84.0% balanced accuracy
(BAcc), rivaling specialized models, MiniCheck (7B; 84.0%) and Granite Guardian
3.3 (8B; 82.2%) while using roughly half their parameters. Over the full
benchmark it reaches 75.7% BAcc, matching larger general-purpose LLMs such as
GPT-4o (75.9%). We will release HalluGuard and datasets under Apache 2.0 upon
acceptance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Sci-SpanDet框架，用于检测学术文本中的AI生成内容，通过结合段落条件风格建模和多层次对比学习，实现跨领域的鲁棒检测和精确的span级定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在学术写作中的快速应用引发了关于作者身份完整性和学术出版物可靠性的严重担忧，现有检测方法存在span定位不精细、校准能力弱、跨领域泛化能力差等问题。

Method: 结合段落条件风格建模与多层次对比学习，集成BIO-CRF序列标注和基于指针的边界解码与置信度校准，实现精确的span级检测和可靠的概率估计。

Result: 在包含10万个标注样本的新建跨学科数据集上，Sci-SpanDet达到最先进性能：F1(AI)为80.17，AUROC为92.63，Span-F1为74.36，在对抗性重写下表现出强韧性，在不同学科和IMRaD段落间保持平衡准确率。

Conclusion: Sci-SpanDet显著超越了现有基线方法，为确保学术文档中AI生成文本检测的可复现性和促进进一步研究，将公开发布整理的数据集和源代码。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in scientific writing
raises serious concerns regarding authorship integrity and the reliability of
scholarly publications. Existing detection approaches mainly rely on
document-level classification or surface-level statistical cues; however, they
neglect fine-grained span localization, exhibit weak calibration, and often
fail to generalize across disciplines and generators. To address these
limitations, we present Sci-SpanDet, a structure-aware framework for detecting
AI-generated scholarly texts. The proposed method combines section-conditioned
stylistic modeling with multi-level contrastive learning to capture nuanced
human-AI differences while mitigating topic dependence, thereby enhancing
cross-domain robustness. In addition, it integrates BIO-CRF sequence labeling
with pointer-based boundary decoding and confidence calibration to enable
precise span-level detection and reliable probability estimates. Extensive
experiments on a newly constructed cross-disciplinary dataset of 100,000
annotated samples generated by multiple LLM families (GPT, Qwen, DeepSeek,
LLaMA) demonstrate that Sci-SpanDet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
F1(AI) of 80.17, AUROC of 92.63, and Span-F1 of 74.36. Furthermore, it shows
strong resilience under adversarial rewriting and maintains balanced accuracy
across IMRaD sections and diverse disciplines, substantially surpassing
existing baselines. To ensure reproducibility and to foster further research on
AI-generated text detection in scholarly documents, the curated dataset and
source code will be publicly released upon publication.

Motivation: 探索检索增强生成在专家级推理任务（如解决奥林匹克物理问题）中的潜力，受学生通过复习过往问题准备竞赛的启发。

Method: 引入PhoPile多模态数据集，包含图表、图形和方程，系统研究基于检索的推理，使用多种检索器对LLMs和LMMs进行基准测试。

Result: 结果表明，将检索与物理语料库集成可以提高模型性能，但也揭示了检索增强物理推理面临的挑战。

Conclusion: 检索增强生成在提升物理推理方面具有潜力，但需要进一步研究来解决现有挑战。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with foundation models has achieved
strong performance across diverse tasks, but their capacity for expert-level
reasoning-such as solving Olympiad-level physics problems-remains largely
unexplored. Inspired by the way students prepare for competitions by reviewing
past problems, we investigate the potential of RAG to enhance physics reasoning
in foundation models. We introduce PhoPile, a high-quality multimodal dataset
specifically designed for Olympiad-level physics, enabling systematic study of
retrieval-based reasoning. PhoPile includes diagrams, graphs, and equations,
capturing the inherently multimodal nature of physics problem solving. Using
PhoPile, we benchmark RAG-augmented foundation models, covering both large
language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) with multiple
retrievers. Our results demonstrate that integrating retrieval with physics
corpora can improve model performance, while also highlighting challenges that
motivate further research in retrieval-augmented physics reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了Fusion-of-N方法，使用通用LLM法官将多个样本中最具信息量的元素融合成单一最终答案，相比传统的Best-of-N方法在测试时扩展和合成数据生成中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Best-of-N方法本质上是零和游戏，丢弃了多样且潜在有用的信息，作者希望探索协作设置，让所有候选样本都能为最终生成做出贡献。

Method: Fusion-of-N方法利用通用LLM法官，从多个样本中合成最具信息量的元素，形成单一最终答案。在测试时扩展和合成数据生成两种设置下进行评估。

Result: 在11种语言、3个多样化任务和不同模型规模上的广泛基准测试中，Fusion-of-N始终优于Best-of-N，在测试时扩展和合成数据生成的下游收益方面表现出多功能性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 应该从单一质量评估转向接受LLM生成的多面性，通过整合多样化优势、释放潜在能力，实现仅通过选择无法达到的改进。

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality generations in modern LLMs has largely been framed as
a selection problem: identifying a single winning generation from a diverse
pool of N samples, the Best-of-N (BoN). Yet, this approach is inherently
zero-sum, discarding diverse and potentially useful information from the pool.
Instead, we explore a collaborative setup, where all candidates can potentially
contribute to the final winning generation. To this end, we propose Fusion-of-N
(FusioN): a method that uses a general LLM judge to synthesize the most
informative elements of each sample into a single final answer. We compare
FusioN to BoN in two settings, (i) test-time scaling, where we sample and
aggregate from a single model at test-time (ii) synthetic data generation,
where we fuse samples from a pool of diverse teachers to improve a student
model. We extensively benchmark both setups across 11 languages, 3 diverse
tasks and varying model scales. Across the bench, FusioN consistently
outperforms BoN showing versatility and robustness both in test-time scaling
and in downstream gains from synthetic data generation. We also perform
extensive analysis on FusioN, where it shows surprising strengths and
robustness under challenging settings. These results show that we should shift
how we think about evaluating and utilizing LLM generations from a monolithic
measure of quality, to embracing their polylithic nature. This shift allows us
to integrate diverse strengths, unlock latent potential, and achieve
improvements that were previously inaccessible through selection alone.

Motivation: 分析LLMs在处理非标准英语方言时的性能下降问题，特别是识别导致性能下降的具体语法因素。

Method: 通过将标准美国英语问题转换为非标准方言变体，在多选题回答任务上测试LLM性能，并分析不同语法规则对性能的影响。

Result: 发现非标准英语问题导致准确率下降高达20%，其中三个特定语法规则（存在性'it'、零系词和'y'all'）可以解释多个方言中观察到的大部分性能下降。

Conclusion: 呼吁未来研究关注针对个别高影响力语法结构的偏见缓解方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are ubiquitous in modern day natural language
processing. However, previous work has shown degraded LLM performance for
under-represented English dialects. We analyze the effects of typifying
"standard" American English language questions as non-"standard" dialectal
variants on multiple choice question answering tasks and find up to a 20%
reduction in accuracy. Additionally, we investigate the grammatical basis of
under-performance in non-"standard" English questions. We find that individual
grammatical rules have varied effects on performance, but some are more
consequential than others: three specific grammar rules (existential "it", zero
copula, and y'all) can explain the majority of performance degradation observed
in multiple dialects. We call for future work to investigate bias mitigation
methods focused on individual, high-impact grammatical structures.

Motivation: 大语言模型生成的文本往往过于通用，缺乏结构多样性，限制了个性化表达

Method: 采用级联框架先生成语法指导再进行条件文本生成，并推广到非级联架构以更好对齐结构和内容；开发共享表示机制支持细粒度个性化

Result: 在多个任务上的实验表明该方法在流畅性、多样性和风格保真度方面具有优势

Conclusion: 该方法能更好地捕捉风格化句子构建的词汇和结构特征，支持忠实风格生成和可泛化的零样本推理

Abstract: Large language models have made revolutionary progress in generating
human-like text, yet their outputs often tend to be generic, exhibiting
insufficient structural diversity, which limits personalized expression. Recent
advances in diffusion models have opened new opportunities for improving
language generation beyond the limitations of autoregressive paradigms. In this
work, we propose a syntax-guided diffusion language model that integrates
structural supervision and personalized conditioning to enhance text quality,
diversity, and controllability. We introduce a cascaded framework that
generates syntactic guidance before conditional text generation, and further
generalize it to a novel noncascaded architecture for better alignment between
structure and content. By incorporating syntactic information in the generating
process, the proposed model better captures the lexical and structural
characteristics of stylistic sentence construction. To enable fine-grained
personalization, we develop a shared representation mechanism that facilitates
information integration across users, supporting both faithful stylistic
generation and generalizable zero-shot inference. Extensive experiments on
multiple tasks demonstrate the superiority of our approach in fluency,
diversity, and stylistic fidelity. Further qualitative analyses highlight its
interpretability and flexibility in learning personalized patterns.

Conclusion: 通过概述最新进展和识别关键挑战，为未来研究提供了路线图，旨在提高模型透明度。

Abstract: Understanding the decision-making processes of neural networks is a central
goal of mechanistic interpretability. In the context of Large Language Models
(LLMs), this involves uncovering the underlying mechanisms and identifying the
roles of individual model components such as neurons and attention heads, as
well as model abstractions such as the learned sparse features extracted by
Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). A rapidly growing line of work tackles this
challenge by using powerful generator models to produce open-vocabulary,
natural language concept descriptions for these components. In this paper, we
provide the first survey of the emerging field of concept descriptions for
model components and abstractions. We chart the key methods for generating
these descriptions, the evolving landscape of automated and human metrics for
evaluating them, and the datasets that underpin this research. Our synthesis
reveals a growing demand for more rigorous, causal evaluation. By outlining the
state of the art and identifying key challenges, this survey provides a roadmap
for future research toward making models more transparent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则的DST方法在开放域多轮聊天机器人中效率不足，无法提供复杂对话中所需的适应性和连贯性。

Method: 使用BERT进行槽位填充和意图检测，XGBoost进行意图验证，GPT进行DST，在线代理进行实时答案生成。

Result: 在波斯语聊天机器人中，相比现有方法显著提高了准确性和连贯性。

Conclusion: 混合方法能有效提升DST能力，为更定制化、适应性更强、更人性化的对话AI系统铺平道路。

Abstract: Dialogue State Tracking (DST) is an essential element of conversational AI
with the objective of deeply understanding the conversation context and leading
it toward answering user requests. Due to high demands for open-domain and
multi-turn chatbots, the traditional rule-based DST is not efficient enough,
since it cannot provide the required adaptability and coherence for human-like
experiences in complex conversations. This study proposes a hybrid DST model
that utilizes rule-based methods along with language models, including BERT for
slot filling and intent detection, XGBoost for intent validation, GPT for DST,
and online agents for real-time answer generation. This model is uniquely
designed to be evaluated on a comprehensive Persian multi-turn dialogue dataset
and demonstrated significantly improved accuracy and coherence over existing
methods in Persian-based chatbots. The results demonstrate how effectively a
hybrid approach may improve DST capabilities, paving the way for conversational
AI systems that are more customized, adaptable, and human-like.

TL;DR: 这篇系统性文献综述分析了2020-2025年间非洲低资源语言自动语音识别(ASR)的研究现状，涵盖数据集、模型、评估方法等方面，揭示了该领域面临的挑战并提出了未来发展建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管ASR技术在全球取得了显著进展，但非洲2000多种低资源语言在数字包容方面仍面临严重不足，这阻碍了非洲大陆的数字包容发展。

Method: 采用PRISMA 2020程序，在DBLP、ACM数字图书馆、Google Scholar、Semantic Scholar和arXiv等数据库中检索2020年1月至2025年7月发表的研究，筛选出71篇相关文献进行分析。

Result: 共记录了74个数据集，涵盖111种语言，约11,206小时的语音数据。只有不到15%的研究提供了可复现材料，数据集许可不明确。自监督和迁移学习技术前景广阔但受限于预训练数据不足、方言覆盖不充分等问题。

Conclusion: 非洲语言ASR研究面临数据集可用性、标注质量、许可不确定性等挑战，但社区驱动倡议和方法论进步为改进提供了途径。可持续发展需要利益相关者合作、创建伦理平衡的数据集、使用轻量级建模技术和积极基准测试。

Abstract: ASR has achieved remarkable global progress, yet African low-resource
languages remain rigorously underrepresented, producing barriers to digital
inclusion across the continent with more than +2000 languages. This systematic
literature review (SLR) explores research on ASR for African languages with a
focus on datasets, models and training methods, evaluation techniques,
challenges, and recommends future directions. We employ the PRISMA 2020
procedures and search DBLP, ACM Digital Library, Google Scholar, Semantic
Scholar, and arXiv for studies published between January 2020 and July 2025. We
include studies related to ASR datasets, models or metrics for African
languages, while excluding non-African, duplicates, and low-quality studies
(score <3/5). We screen 71 out of 2,062 records and we record a total of 74
datasets across 111 languages, encompassing approximately 11,206 hours of
speech. Fewer than 15% of research provided reproducible materials, and dataset
licensing is not clear. Self-supervised and transfer learning techniques are
promising, but are hindered by limited pre-training data, inadequate coverage
of dialects, and the availability of resources. Most of the researchers use
Word Error Rate (WER), with very minimal use of linguistically informed scores
such as Character Error Rate (CER) or Diacritic Error Rate (DER), and thus with
limited application in tonal and morphologically rich languages. The existing
evidence on ASR systems is inconsistent, hindered by issues like dataset
availability, poor annotations, licensing uncertainties, and limited
benchmarking. Nevertheless, the rise of community-driven initiatives and
methodological advancements indicates a pathway for improvement. Sustainable
development for this area will also include stakeholder partnership, creation
of ethically well-balanced datasets, use of lightweight modelling techniques,
and active benchmarking.

Abstract: Evaluation using Large Language Model (LLM) judges has been widely adopted in
English and shown to be effective for automatic evaluation. However, their
performance does not generalize well to non-English settings, and it remains
unclear what constitutes effective multilingual training for such judges. In
this paper, we introduce mR3, a massively multilingual, rubric-agnostic reward
reasoning model trained on 72 languages, achieving the broadest language
coverage in reward modeling to date. We present a comprehensive study of data
and curriculum selection for training to identify effective strategies and data
sources for building high-quality reward models, including the integration of
target-language reasoning datasets. Our approach attains state-of-the-art
performance on multilingual reward model benchmarks, surpassing much larger
models (i.e., GPT-OSS-120B) while being up to 9x smaller, and its effectiveness
is further confirmed through extensive ablation studies. Our models, data, and

TL;DR: MASH是一个通过强化学习训练LLM选择性求助的框架，将外部搜索作为弃权的代理信号，在提高回答准确性的同时减少不必要的搜索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM无法可靠识别自身知识边界，经常对超出知识范围的问题产生幻觉回答。相比之下，人类能够认识到自身局限性，选择寻求外部帮助或弃权。

Method: 使用强化学习框架，通过按次搜索付费的奖励机制，在惩罚不必要搜索的同时奖励回答准确性，将外部搜索行为作为弃权的代理信号。

Result: 在三个知识密集型QA数据集上的实验显示，MASH显著优于先前的高效搜索方法；在多跳数据集上回答准确率提高7.6%，并能有效区分可回答/不可回答问题。

Conclusion: MASH训练有效对齐了搜索工具使用与参数知识，无需预先确定知识边界即可实现弃权决策，展示了与专门弃权方法类似的行为。

Abstract: LLMs cannot reliably recognize their parametric knowledge boundaries and
often hallucinate answers to outside-of-boundary questions. In contrast, humans
recognize their limitations and can either seek external help for such
questions or abstain. In this paper, we introduce MASH (Modeling Abstention via
Selective Help-seeking), a training framework that readily extracts abstentions
from LLMs. Our key idea is that any external help-seeking by an LLM, i.e.
search tool use, can serve as a proxy for abstention if the external help
(search) is appropriately penalized while simultaneously rewarding answer
accuracy. MASH operationalizes this idea using reinforcement learning with a
pay-per-search reward.
  We run experiments on three knowledge-intensive QA datasets. Our results show
that MASH substantially improves upon the selective help-seeking performance of
prior efficient search approaches; on multi-hop datasets, MASH improves answer
accuracy by 7.6%. Furthermore, MASH demonstrates strong off-the-shelf
abstention -- it can distinguish between unanswerable/answerable questions and
selectively generate responses for answerable questions -- showcasing behavior
analogous to specialized abstention approaches. We emphasize that contrary to
prior abstention methods, MASH does not require pre-determining knowledge
boundaries to construct training data. Instead, MASH's abstentions are a
by-product of training for the auxiliary selective help-seeking task. Overall,
we show that MASH training effectively aligns search tool use with parametric
knowledge, which can be successfully leveraged for making abstention decisions.

Result: 攻击在四个任务中一致实现高成功率，范围从90.76%到99.41%，证明了音频后门攻击的有效性。

Conclusion: 多模态语音语言模型面临严重的音频后门攻击威胁，提出的基于微调的防御方法能够有效缓解预训练编码器中毒的风险。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal extensions are becoming
increasingly popular. One common approach to enable multimodality is to cascade
domain-specific encoders with an LLM, making the resulting model inherit
vulnerabilities from all of its components. In this work, we present the first
systematic study of audio backdoor attacks against speech language models. We
demonstrate its effectiveness across four speech encoders and three datasets,
covering four tasks: automatic speech recognition (ASR), speech emotion
recognition, and gender and age prediction. The attack consistently achieves
high success rates, ranging from 90.76% to 99.41%. To better understand how
backdoors propagate, we conduct a component-wise analysis to identify the most
vulnerable stages of the pipeline. Finally, we propose a fine-tuning-based
defense that mitigates the threat of poisoned pretrained encoders.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了社会福利函数基准，评估大语言模型在资源分配中的表现，发现大多数模型偏向功利主义，优先考虑群体效率而忽视公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型被用于高风险决策，需要评估它们在分配稀缺社会资源时所依据的原则和价值观。

Method: 引入社会福利函数基准，这是一个动态模拟环境，让LLM作为主权分配者向异质社区分配任务，在集体效率（投资回报率）和分配公平（基尼系数）之间创建持久权衡。

Result: 评估了20个最先进的LLM，发现：1）通用对话能力无法预测分配技能；2）大多数LLM表现出强烈的功利主义倾向；3）分配策略容易受到输出长度约束和社会影响框架的干扰。

Conclusion: 当前LLM作为社会决策者存在风险，需要专门的基准测试和针对性的对齐来确保AI治理的公平性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly entrusted with high-stakes
decisions that affect human welfare. However, the principles and values that
guide these models when distributing scarce societal resources remain largely
unexamined. To address this, we introduce the Social Welfare Function (SWF)
Benchmark, a dynamic simulation environment where an LLM acts as a sovereign
allocator, distributing tasks to a heterogeneous community of recipients. The
benchmark is designed to create a persistent trade-off between maximizing
collective efficiency (measured by Return on Investment) and ensuring
distributive fairness (measured by the Gini coefficient). We evaluate 20
state-of-the-art LLMs and present the first leaderboard for social welfare
allocation. Our findings reveal three key insights: (i) A model's general
conversational ability, as measured by popular leaderboards, is a poor
predictor of its allocation skill. (ii) Most LLMs exhibit a strong default
utilitarian orientation, prioritizing group productivity at the expense of
severe inequality. (iii) Allocation strategies are highly vulnerable, easily
perturbed by output-length constraints and social-influence framing. These
results highlight the risks of deploying current LLMs as societal
decision-makers and underscore the need for specialized benchmarks and targeted
alignment for AI governance.

*Oussama Gabouj,Kamel Charaf,Ivan Zakazov,Nicolas Baldwin,Robert West*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出GRAD方法，通过训练LLM生成针对特定输入的简洁演示，在预算限制下优于传统RAG方法，并在数学推理和STEM问题上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法依赖静态数据库，缺乏适应性且可能提供不相关的演示，限制了LLM的性能表现。

Method: 训练LLM模型生成输入特定的简洁演示，动态地为每个输入提供定制化的上下文支持。

Result: 在数学数据集上训练的GRAD在Qwen2.5-14B上持续优于基线方法，在数学推理和STEM问题上表现优异，并能有效泛化到物理、化学、计算机科学等OOD领域。

Conclusion: GRAD引入了可扩展的演示生成器模型，为资源受限环境下的动态少样本学习范式迈出了第一步。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across diverse tasks,
but their effectiveness often depends on the quality of the provided context.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enriches prompts with external
information, but its reliance on static databases constrains adaptability and
can result in irrelevant demonstrations. In this work, we propose a Generative
Retrieval-Aligned Demonstrator (GRAD), a dynamic demonstration-based approach
where an LLM model is trained to generate input-specific concise
demonstrations. By tailoring demonstrations to each input, our method offers
better contextual support than traditional RAG approaches. We demonstrate the
superiority of GRAD under budget constraints, where we limit both the number of
tokens used per demonstration and the number of tokens used for the final
output. Trained solely on a math dataset, GRAD consistently outperforms strong
baselines on Qwen2.5-14B across mathematical reasoning and advanced STEM
questions, highlighting GRAD's robust generalization to out-of-distribution
(OOD) domains such as physics, chemistry, and computer science. Furthermore, we
show that demonstrations generated by trained smaller models can effectively
guide larger target models, reducing training costs while maintaining
competitive accuracy. Overall, this work introduces a scalable demonstration
generator model presenting the first step toward a dynamic few-shot learning
paradigm in resource-constrained settings. We release the code used for the
project.

### [153] [Verbalized Sampling: How to Mitigate Mode Collapse and Unlock LLM Diversity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01171)
*Jiayi Zhang,Simon Yu,Derek Chong,Anthony Sicilia,Michael R. Tomz,Christopher D. Manning,Weiyan Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文发现后训练对齐导致LLM多样性降低（模式崩溃）的根本原因是偏好数据中的典型性偏见，并提出了一种无需训练的提示策略——言语化采样来规避此问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将模式崩溃归因于算法限制，但本文识别出数据层面的根本驱动因素：认知心理学中的典型性偏见，即标注者系统性地偏好熟悉文本。

Method: 提出言语化采样（VS）策略，提示模型对一组响应进行概率分布言语化（如"生成5个关于咖啡的笑话及其对应概率"），这是一种无需训练的提示方法。

Result: 在创意写作、对话模拟、开放QA和合成数据生成等任务中，VS显著提升性能，创意写作多样性提高1.6-2.1倍，且不牺牲事实准确性和安全性。能力更强的模型从VS中获益更多。

Conclusion: 本文提供了关于模式崩溃的数据中心视角，并提出实用的推理时解决方案，有助于释放预训练生成模型的多样性。

Abstract: Post-training alignment often reduces LLM diversity, leading to a phenomenon
known as mode collapse. Unlike prior work that attributes this effect to
algorithmic limitations, we identify a fundamental, pervasive data-level
driver: typicality bias in preference data, whereby annotators systematically
favor familiar text as a result of well-established findings in cognitive
psychology. We formalize this bias theoretically, verify it on preference
datasets empirically, and show that it plays a central role in mode collapse.
Motivated by this analysis, we introduce Verbalized Sampling, a simple,
training-free prompting strategy to circumvent mode collapse. VS prompts the
model to verbalize a probability distribution over a set of responses (e.g.,
``Generate 5 jokes about coffee and their corresponding probabilities'').
Comprehensive experiments show that VS significantly improves performance
across creative writing (poems, stories, jokes), dialogue simulation,
open-ended QA, and synthetic data generation, without sacrificing factual
accuracy and safety. For instance, in creative writing, VS increases diversity
by 1.6-2.1x over direct prompting. We further observe an emergent trend that
more capable models benefit more from VS. In sum, our work provides a new
data-centric perspective on mode collapse and a practical inference-time remedy
that helps unlock pre-trained generative diversity.

*Qingyuan Liu,Jia-Chen Gu,Yunzhi Yao,Hong Wang,Nanyun Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出SPHERE方法，通过超球面能量正则化来稳定神经元权重分布，解决大语言模型顺序编辑中的性能退化问题，在保持原有知识的同时实现可靠的知识更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型需要持续更新以保持与现实世界知识同步，但顺序编辑往往会导致表示不稳定和灾难性遗忘。作者假设超球面均匀性有助于模型保持稳定并容纳新知识。

Method: 提出SPHERE方法，使用超球面能量量化神经元均匀性，识别预训练权重矩阵的主超球面方向的互补稀疏空间，并将新知识投影到该空间以减少对主方向的扰动。

Result: 在LLaMA3和Qwen2.5上的实验表明，SPHERE在编辑能力上平均优于最佳基线16.41%，同时能最忠实地保持模型的一般性能。

Conclusion: SPHERE提供了一种原则性的方法，通过稳定超球面能量来实现可靠的大规模知识编辑，解决了顺序编辑中的稳定性和知识保留问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require constant updates to remain aligned with
evolving real-world knowledge. Model editing offers a lightweight alternative
to retraining, but sequential editing often destabilizes representations and
induces catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we seek to better understand and
mitigate performance degradation caused by sequential editing. We hypothesize
that hyperspherical uniformity, a property that maintains uniform distribution
of neuron weights on a hypersphere, helps the model remain stable, retain prior
knowledge, while still accommodate new updates. We use Hyperspherical Energy
(HE) to quantify neuron uniformity during editing, and examine its correlation
with editing performance. Empirical studies across widely used editing methods
reveals a strong correlation between HE dynamics and editing performance, with
editing failures consistently coinciding with high HE fluctuations. We further
theoretically prove that HE dynamics impose a lower bound on the degradation of
pretrained knowledge, highlighting why HE stability is crucial for knowledge
retention. Motivated by these insights, we propose SPHERE (Sparse Projection
for Hyperspherical Energy-Regularized Editing), an HE-driven regularization
strategy that stabilizes neuron weight distributions, ultimately preserving
prior knowledge while enabling reliable sequential updates. Specifically,
SPHERE identifies a sparse space complementary to the principal hyperspherical
directions of the pretrained weight matrices and projects new knowledge onto
it, attenuating perturbations on the principal directions. Extensive
experiments on LLaMA3 (8B) and Qwen2.5 (7B) show that SPHERE outperforms the
best baseline in editing capability by an average of 16.41%, while most
faithfully preserving general model performance, thereby offering a principled
path toward reliable large-scale knowledge editing.

paradigm. Experiments are conducted in PettingZoo environment, where multiple

Conclusion: ToolBrain为研究人员和从业者提供了一个用户友好的框架，能够有效训练LLM智能体在特定领域使用工具，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Effective tool use is essential for agentic AI, yet training agents to
utilize tools remains challenging due to manually designed rewards, limited
training data, and poor multi-tool selection, resulting in slow adaptation,
wasted computational resources, and suboptimal performance. We introduce
ToolBrain, a lightweight and user-friendly framework for coaching tool use in
agentic models with flexible reinforcement learning (RL), easing the barriers
for researchers and practitioners to adapt LLM-based agents to specific
domains. It supports a wide range of training strategies, including RL
algorithms such as GRPO and DPO, as well as supervised learning. ToolBrain
enables custom reward callables directly on an agent's execution traces or
simply utilizes an automated LLM-as-a-judge system for reward generation. It is
packed with useful capabilities, including knowledge distillation from large to
small models for efficient development, automatic task generation from tool
descriptions, seamless tool retrieval, efficient fine-tuning pipelines with
QLoRA through Unsloth, and quantized inference via bitsandbytes. We demonstrate
ToolBrain through diverse use cases, such as training a CodeAct agent to
autonomously execute email search tasks, showing fast, targeted improvements
(up to 30.0%) in tool-use skills while keeping the codebase simple and
extensible in Agentic AI. Our framework is publicly available at

Motivation: 大型推理语言模型在复杂推理任务中表现出色，但存在计算效率低下的问题，现有方法难以平衡推理质量与推理成本降低。

Method: 采用训练自由的自适应推理抑制方法，通过多检查点确定性估计机制和渐进抑制阈值来动态抑制冗余推理步骤。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，ARS实现了最高53%的token减少、46.1%的延迟减少和57.9%的能耗减少，同时保持或提高了准确性。

Conclusion: ARS方法在多个模型架构上均表现出色，为大型语言模型的高效推理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs or LRMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, but suffer from significant
computational inefficiencies due to overthinking phenomena. Existing efficient

Motivation: 当前AI政策制定缺乏科学共识形成机制，而NeurIPS作为AI领域的领导者，有能力填补这一空白。

Method: 建议NeurIPS开展初步试点项目，借鉴IPCC在气候政策共识形成方面的经验教训。

Result: 识别了当前共识形成机制的缺失，并论证了NeurIPS是最佳选择。

Conclusion: NeurIPS应该在AI政策科学共识形成方面发挥领导作用，以制定更高质量的AI政策。

Abstract: Designing wise AI policy is a grand challenge for society. To design such
policy, policymakers should place a premium on rigorous evidence and scientific
consensus. While several mechanisms exist for evidence generation, and nascent
mechanisms tackle evidence synthesis, we identify a complete void on consensus
formation. In this position paper, we argue NeurIPS should actively catalyze
scientific consensus on AI policy. Beyond identifying the current deficit in
consensus formation mechanisms, we argue that NeurIPS is the best option due
its strengths and the paucity of compelling alternatives. To make progress, we
recommend initial pilots for NeurIPS by distilling lessons from the IPCC's
leadership to build scientific consensus on climate policy. We dispel
predictable counters that AI researchers disagree too much to achieve consensus
and that policy engagement is not the business of NeurIPS. NeurIPS leads AI on
many fronts, and it should champion scientific consensus to create higher
quality AI policy.

both accuracy and interpretability remains a significant challenge. This paper
introduces the Fuzzy Transformer (Fuzzformer), a novel recurrent neural network
architecture combined with multi-head self-attention and fuzzy inference
systems to analyze multivariate stock market data and conduct long-term time

interpretable forecasting and identify current performance tradeoffs,
suggesting practical application in understanding and forecasting stock market
behavior.

Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型的兴起，法律判决预测系统可能利用罪犯图像和文本案件报告，这可能带来意外后果和恶意使用。需要评估VLMs在保释决策中的效率。

Method: 1) 审计独立VLMs在保释预测任务中的表现；2) 设计干预算法：通过RAG管道引入法律先例；3) 使用创新方案微调VLMs。

Result: 独立VLMs在多个交叉群体中表现不佳，会错误地高置信度拒绝应获保释者。干预措施显著提高了保释预测性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作为未来在VLMs部署到真实世界法律判决预测之前设计更智能的干预措施铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been extensively used for legal judgment
prediction tasks based on case reports and crime history. However, with a surge
in the availability of large vision language models (VLMs), legal judgment
prediction systems can now be made to leverage the images of the criminals in
addition to the textual case reports/crime history. Applications built in this
way could lead to inadvertent consequences and be used with malicious intent.
In this work, we run an audit to investigate the efficiency of standalone VLMs
in the bail decision prediction task. We observe that the performance is poor
across multiple intersectional groups and models \textit{wrongly deny bail to
deserving individuals with very high confidence}. We design different
intervention algorithms by first including legal precedents through a RAG
pipeline and then fine-tuning the VLMs using innovative schemes. We demonstrate
that these interventions substantially improve the performance of bail
prediction. Our work paves the way for the design of smarter interventions on
VLMs in the future, before they can be deployed for real-world legal judgment
prediction.

Method: 利用具身AI和大视觉语言模型提供常识推理能力，在模拟城市环境中动态解释周围环境并实时生成适当的行动决策。

Result: 在Unreal Engine模拟的城市场景中，无人机能够动态理解环境并决定紧急机动以实现安全着陆。

Conclusion: 具身AI使得以前无法手动设计的新型自适应恢复和决策管道成为可能，提升了自主空中系统的韧性和安全性。

Abstract: Autonomous drones must often respond to sudden events, such as alarms,
faults, or unexpected changes in their environment, that require immediate and
adaptive decision-making. Traditional approaches rely on safety engineers
hand-coding large sets of recovery rules, but this strategy cannot anticipate
the vast range of real-world contingencies and quickly becomes incomplete.
Recent advances in embodied AI, powered by large visual language models,
provide commonsense reasoning to assess context and generate appropriate
actions in real time. We demonstrate this capability in a simulated urban
benchmark in the Unreal Engine, where drones dynamically interpret their
surroundings and decide on sudden maneuvers for safe landings. Our results show
that embodied AI makes possible a new class of adaptive recovery and
decision-making pipelines that were previously infeasible to design by hand,
advancing resilience and safety in autonomous aerial systems.

Result: 在500个示例的TS-SQL测试集上，Thinkquel（32B）通过两阶段SFT课程达到93.2%的执行成功率和61.8%的精确结果匹配，相比基础模型分别提高了67.2%（执行）和44.4%（匹配）。在Spider（14B）实验中，TS-GRPO提高了训练稳定性并加速了执行匹配奖励的收敛。

Conclusion: Thinkquel通过创新的合成数据管道和强化学习方法，显著提高了自然语言到SQL转换的可靠性和可移植性，为生产环境中的数据库查询生成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Transforming natural-language requests into reliable, production-ready data
transformations remains challenging: correctness depends on precise schema
linking and warehouse-specific SQL dialects, while the strongest supervision
available during training--execution success and result matching--are provided
only at the sequence level. At the same time, assembling large,
execution-validated corpora is costly, and token-level objectives misalign with
these global signals, yielding unstable optimization and limited portability.
We introduce Thinkquel, a fine-tuned model for producing robust, portable, and
execution-validated database queries. Methodologies in Thinkquel integrates a
novel synthetic data pipeline, TS-SQL, that leverages dbt as a portable
intermediate representation with a span-aware reinforcement learning objective,
and Token-Sequence GRPO (TS-GRPO), specifically designed to bridge the gap
between token-level training signals and sequence-level execution rewards when
finetuning LLMs. On the 500-example TS-SQL test set, Thinkquel (32B) reaches
93.2\% execution success and 61.8\% exact-result match with a two-stage SFT
curriculum, improving over the base model by 67.2\% (exec.) and 44.4\% (match).
In Spider (14B) experiments, TS-GRPO increases training stability and speeds
convergence of the execution-match reward relative to GRPO and GSPO.

TL;DR: 提出AttentionDep模型，通过融合上下文和领域知识进行可解释的抑郁症严重程度检测，在社交媒体平台上实现优于现有方法5%以上的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用社交媒体平台（如Facebook、X、Reddit）作为了解个体心理状态的窗口，开发可信赖且透明的AI系统用于心理健康评估。

Method: 使用层次化编码（单字和双字）处理帖子，通过注意力机制突出临床相关标记，并利用心理健康知识图谱的领域知识通过交叉注意力机制丰富上下文特征，最后使用有序回归框架预测抑郁症严重程度。

Result: AttentionDep在多个数据集上的分级F1分数比现有最优方法高出5%以上，同时提供可解释的预测洞察。

Conclusion: 该工作推动了基于社交媒体的心理健康评估的可信透明AI系统发展，AttentionDep模型在性能和可解释性方面均表现出色。

Abstract: In today's interconnected society, social media platforms provide a window
into individuals' thoughts, emotions, and mental states. This paper explores
the use of platforms like Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Reddit for
depression severity detection. We propose AttentionDep, a domain-aware
attention model that drives explainable depression severity estimation by
fusing contextual and domain knowledge. Posts are encoded hierarchically using
unigrams and bigrams, with attention mechanisms highlighting clinically
relevant tokens. Domain knowledge from a curated mental health knowledge graph
is incorporated through a cross-attention mechanism, enriching the contextual
features. Finally, depression severity is predicted using an ordinal regression
framework that respects the clinical-relevance and natural ordering of severity
levels. Our experiments demonstrate that AttentionDep outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by over 5% in graded F1 score across datasets, while
providing interpretable insights into its predictions. This work advances the
development of trustworthy and transparent AI systems for mental health
assessment from social media.

TL;DR: 提出了一种分解工具调用任务的方法，通过分离工具选择和参数生成两个子任务，使用LoRA微调创建专用适配器，并在推理时动态加载相应适配器来提升本地LLM的工具调用性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本地LLM在工具调用场景中表现不如前沿模型，特别是在大型工具集选择和复杂参数结构生成方面存在困难，需要隐私保护且成本效益高的设备端推理解决方案。

Method: 提出解耦微调方法，使用LoRA微调为工具选择和工具特定参数生成创建专用适配器，采用分离损失掩码；并开发DualTune推理框架，动态加载适配器并实施分层编排来限制工具选择数量。

Result: 在MCP-Bench基准测试中，使用解耦微调训练的Qwen-2.5-7B模型将基础模型的工具调用准确率提高了46%，在大多数情况下优于其他相似大小的本地推理、非推理和微调模型，甚至优于2倍大小的模型。

Conclusion: 解耦微调和DualTune框架有效提升了本地LLM在工具调用任务中的性能，为设备端代理编排提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) as agentic orchestrators has
revolutionized task automation, but the need for privacy-preserving,
cost-effective solutions demands on-device inference capabilities. However,
local LLMs consistently underperform compared to frontier models in tool
calling scenarios, struggling with both tool selection from large tool sets and
accurate argument generation for complex parameter structures. We introduce a
methodology that disaggregates a tool-calling task into two distinct subtasks:
tool selection and argument generation. We propose "decoupled fine-tuning", a
novel post-training approach that employs LoRA fine-tuning to create dedicated
LoRA adapters for tool selection and tool-specific argument generation using
separate loss masking for each of the subtasks. Furthermore, we present
DualTune, an inference framework that leverages the LoRA adapters created using
decoupled fine-tuning to perform efficient agent orchestration with the help of
local models on end-user devices. DualTune decomposes the tool-call generation
step into tool selection and argument generation, and dynamically loads the
corresponding LoRA adapters to generate tool calls. Additionally, DualTune
implements hierarchical orchestration to restrict the number of tools required
for tool selection. Our experiments on the MCP-Bench benchmark demonstrate that
the Qwen-2.5-7B model trained using decoupled fine-tuning improves the tool
calling accuracy of the base model by 46%, and outperforms other local
reasoning, non-reasoning and fine-tuned models of similar size in all cases,
and models that are 2x larger, in most cases.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了MAGIC-MASK框架，将基于扰动的可解释性方法扩展到多智能体强化学习，通过智能体间协作共享掩码状态信息和经验，提高关键状态发现效率和解释保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度强化学习智能体的决策过程理解在安全关键和多智能体环境中至关重要，现有方法存在计算成本高、探索覆盖不足、缺乏多智能体适应性等问题。

Method: 集成近端策略优化、自适应ε-贪婪探索和轻量级智能体间协作，通过轨迹扰动、奖励保真度分析和KL散度正则化的统一数学形式化实现可解释性。

Result: 在单智能体和多智能体基准测试中，包括多智能体高速公路驾驶环境和Google Research Football，MAGIC-MASK在保真度、学习效率和策略鲁棒性方面持续优于最先进基线。

Conclusion: 该框架通过概率建模和多智能体马尔可夫决策过程提供了局部化、可解释的解释，实现了从单智能体到多智能体系统的可解释性泛化。

Abstract: Understanding the decision-making process of Deep Reinforcement Learning
agents remains a key challenge for deploying these systems in safety-critical
and multi-agent environments. While prior explainability methods like
StateMask, have advanced the identification of critical states, they remain
limited by computational cost, exploration coverage, and lack of adaptation to
multi-agent settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
mathematically grounded framework, MAGIC-MASK (Multi-Agent Guided Inter-agent
Collaboration with Mask-Based Explainability for Reinforcement Learning), that
extends perturbation-based explanation to Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.
Our method integrates Proximal Policy Optimization, adaptive epsilon-greedy
exploration, and lightweight inter-agent collaboration to share masked state
information and peer experience. This collaboration enables each agent to
perform saliency-guided masking and share reward-based insights with peers,
reducing the time required for critical state discovery, improving explanation
fidelity, and leading to faster and more robust learning. The core novelty of
our approach lies in generalizing explainability from single-agent to
multi-agent systems through a unified mathematical formalism built on
trajectory perturbation, reward fidelity analysis, and Kullback-Leibler
divergence regularization. This framework yields localized, interpretable
explanations grounded in probabilistic modeling and multi-agent Markov decision
processes. We validate our framework on both single-agent and multi-agent
benchmarks, including a multi-agent highway driving environment and Google
Research Football, demonstrating that MAGIC-MASK consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in fidelity, learning efficiency, and policy
robustness while offering interpretable and transferable explanations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ICL指南虽然能提升特定任务的性能，但会损害跨领域的推理能力，导致"优化脆弱性"现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索ICL指南对不同知识领域推理能力的影响，特别是对复杂推理任务的潜在负面影响。

Method: 使用GPT-OSS:20b模型的六个变体（一个基线模型和五个ICL配置），在840个测试中评估一般知识问题、逻辑谜题和数学奥赛问题的表现。

Result: ICL模型在一般知识任务上达到91%-99%准确率，但在复杂推理问题上表现下降，谜题准确率降至10-43%（基线为43%）。数学奥赛问题无显著差异。

Conclusion: ICL指南在效率和推理灵活性之间存在系统性权衡，对LLM部署和AI安全具有重要影响。

Abstract: ICL guides are known to improve task-specific performance, but their impact
on cross-domain cognitive abilities remains unexplored. This study examines how
ICL guides affect reasoning across different knowledge domains using six
variants of the GPT-OSS:20b model: one baseline model and five ICL
configurations (simple, chain-of-thought, random, appended text, and symbolic
language). The models were subjected to 840 tests spanning general knowledge
questions, logic riddles, and a mathematical olympiad problem. Statistical
analysis (ANOVA) revealed significant behavioral modifications (p less than
0.001) across ICL variants, demonstrating a phenomenon termed "optimized
fragility." ICL models achieved 91%-99% accuracy on general knowledge tasks
while showing degraded performance on complex reasoning problems, with accuracy
dropping to 10-43% on riddles compared to 43% for the baseline model. Notably,
no significant differences emerged on the olympiad problem (p=0.2173),
suggesting that complex mathematical reasoning remains unaffected by ICL
optimization. These findings indicate that ICL guides create systematic
trade-offs between efficiency and reasoning flexibility, with important
implications for LLM deployment and AI safety.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了LLM代理在工具选择中的偏见问题，提出了评估工具选择偏见的基准，发现模型存在对特定提供商的偏爱或对列表中靠前工具的偏好，并提出了轻量级缓解方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理依赖外部工具市场，如果工具选择存在系统性偏见，会降低用户体验并扭曲市场竞争，因此需要研究工具选择偏见问题。

Method: 构建包含多个功能等效工具的基准，测试7个模型，进行控制实验分析工具特征、元数据和预训练暴露的影响，提出基于过滤和均匀采样的缓解方法。

Result: 发现语义对齐是选择的最强预测因子，扰动描述会显著改变选择，重复预训练暴露会放大偏见，提出的缓解方法能减少偏见同时保持良好任务覆盖率。

Conclusion: 工具选择偏见是工具增强LLM公平部署的关键障碍，需要关注和解决。

Abstract: Agents backed by large language models (LLMs) often rely on external tools
drawn from marketplaces where multiple providers offer functionally equivalent
options. This raises a critical point concerning fairness: if selection is
systematically biased, it can degrade user experience and distort competition
by privileging some providers over others. We introduce a benchmark of diverse
tool categories, each containing multiple functionally equivalent tools, to
evaluate tool-selection bias. Using this benchmark, we test seven models and
show that unfairness exists with models either fixating on a single provider or
disproportionately preferring earlier-listed tools in context. To investigate
the origins of this bias, we conduct controlled experiments examining tool
features, metadata (name, description, parameters), and pre-training exposure.
We find that: (1) semantic alignment between queries and metadata is the
strongest predictor of choice; (2) perturbing descriptions significantly shifts
selections; and (3) repeated pre-training exposure to a single endpoint
amplifies bias. Finally, we propose a lightweight mitigation that first filters
the candidate tools to a relevant subset and then samples uniformly, reducing
bias while preserving good task coverage. Our findings highlight tool-selection
bias as a key obstacle for the fair deployment of tool-augmented LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CAIA基准测试揭示了AI模型在对抗性高风险环境中的严重缺陷，即使是最先进的模型也难以在存在主动欺骗的情况下做出准确判断，特别是在加密货币等不可逆决策场景中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI评估主要关注受控环境下的任务完成能力，但现实世界部署需要模型具备对抗误导信息的韧性。加密货币市场2024年因漏洞损失300亿美元，是测试AI对抗性能力的理想场景。

Method: 使用加密货币市场作为测试平台，评估17个模型在178个时间锚定任务上的表现。任务要求模型区分真相与操纵、导航碎片化信息环境，并在对抗压力下做出不可逆的财务决策。

Result: 无工具辅助时，前沿模型准确率仅28%；工具增强后提升至67.4%，但仍低于人类基准的80%。模型存在系统性工具选择灾难，偏好不可靠的网页搜索而非权威数据源，即使正确答案可通过专业工具直接获取。

Conclusion: 当前模型尽管在推理得分上表现优异，但在需要对抗主动反对的环境中仍存在根本性不足。对抗性鲁棒性是实现可信AI自主性的必要条件，CAIA基准为此提供了持续更新的评估框架。

Abstract: We present CAIA, a benchmark exposing a critical blind spot in AI evaluation:
the inability of state-of-the-art models to operate in adversarial, high-stakes
environments where misinformation is weaponized and errors are irreversible.
While existing benchmarks measure task completion in controlled settings,
real-world deployment demands resilience against active deception. Using crypto
markets as a testbed where $30 billion was lost to exploits in 2024, we
evaluate 17 models on 178 time-anchored tasks requiring agents to distinguish
truth from manipulation, navigate fragmented information landscapes, and make
irreversible financial decisions under adversarial pressure.
  Our results reveal a fundamental capability gap: without tools, even frontier
models achieve only 28% accuracy on tasks junior analysts routinely handle.
Tool augmentation improves performance but plateaus at 67.4% versus 80% human
baseline, despite unlimited access to professional resources. Most critically,
we uncover a systematic tool selection catastrophe: models preferentially
choose unreliable web search over authoritative data, falling for SEO-optimized
misinformation and social media manipulation. This behavior persists even when
correct answers are directly accessible through specialized tools, suggesting
foundational limitations rather than knowledge gaps. We also find that Pass@k
metrics mask dangerous trial-and-error behavior for autonomous deployment.
  The implications extend beyond crypto to any domain with active adversaries,
e.g. cybersecurity, content moderation, etc. We release CAIA with contamination
controls and continuous updates, establishing adversarial robustness as a
necessary condition for trustworthy AI autonomy. The benchmark reveals that
current models, despite impressive reasoning scores, remain fundamentally
unprepared for environments where intelligence must survive active opposition.

Conclusion: 研究结果提出了令人惊讶的观察和进一步研究的有趣方向

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable performance in natural language
processing and related domains, as they largely focus on sequential,
autoregressive next-token prediction tasks. Yet, they struggle in logical
reasoning, not necessarily because of a fundamental limitation of these models,
but possibly due to the lack of exploration of more creative uses, such as
latent space and recurrent reasoning. An emerging exploration in this direction
is the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (Wang et al., 2025), which introduces a
novel type of recurrent reasoning in the latent space of transformers,
achieving remarkable performance on a wide range of 2D reasoning tasks. Despite
the promising results, this line of models is still at an early stage and calls
for in-depth investigation. In this work, we perform a critical review on this
class of models, examine key design choices and present intriguing variants
that achieve significantly better performance on the Sudoku-Extreme and
Maze-Hard tasks than previously reported. Our results also raise surprising
observations and intriguing directions for further research.

Conclusion: 该语义驱动框架为AI智能体通信网络提供了有效解决方案，在动态环境和资源受限场景下具有重要应用潜力。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of intelligent services, communication targets are
shifting from humans to artificial intelligent (AI) agents, which require new
paradigms to enable real-time perception, decision-making, and collaboration.
Semantic communication, which conveys task-relevant meaning rather than raw
data, offers a promising solution. However, its practical deployment remains
constrained by dynamic environments and limited resources. To address these
issues, this article proposes a semantic-driven AI agent communication
framework and develops three enabling techniques. First, semantic adaptation
transmission applies fine-tuning with real or generative samples to efficiently
adapt models to varying environments. Second, semantic lightweight transmission
incorporates pruning, quantization, and perception-aware sampling to reduce
model complexity and alleviate computational burden on edge agents. Third,
semantic self-evolution control employs distributed hierarchical
decision-making to optimize multi-dimensional resources, enabling robust
multi-agent collaboration in dynamic environments. Simulation results show that
the proposed solutions achieve faster convergence and stronger robustness,
while the proposed distributed hierarchical optimization method significantly
outperforms conventional decision-making schemes, highlighting its potential
for AI agent communication networks.

Motivation: 现有智能体基准测试面临新开发的智能体快速达到性能上限的问题，难以满足评估智能体能力的需求，需要更可持续和具有挑战性的评估系统。

Method: TRACE框架包含三个阶段：进化提案挖掘（通过初步探索和发散思维提供任务进化提案）、问题构建与自由探索（将提案概念化为可行问题候选，智能体自由探索并记录执行轨迹）、多级验证（确保进化任务具有可验证和可复现的轨迹）。

Result: 在GAIA基准测试上的实验表明，TRACE框架能持续提升任务复杂度，同时通过可验证的执行轨迹提高正确性的可靠性。

Conclusion: 这项工作标志着从静态、人工策划的基准测试向动态、自我演化的评估系统的范式转变，为智能体开发提供了可持续且具有挑战性的发展路径。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and agent system designs have
empowered agents with unprecedented levels of capability. However, existing
agent benchmarks are showing a trend of rapid ceiling-hitting by newly
developed agents, making it difficult to meet the demands for evaluating agent
abilities. To address this problem, we propose the Trajectory-based
Validated-by-Reproducing Agent-benchmark Complexity Evolution (TRACE)
framework. This framework takes an original task from an existing benchmark and
encourages agents to freely explore and evolve it into a new task with higher
difficulty while recording validatable agent trajectories. The framework
proceeds in three stages: (1) evolutionary proposal mining, which provides task
evolution proposals through preliminary exploration and divergent thinking; (2)
problem formation and free exploration, where proposals are conceptualized into
feasible problem candidates and the agents then explore them freely while
recording their execution trajectories; and (3) multi-level validation, which
ensures that the evolved tasks are accompanied by validatable and reproducible
trajectories. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate that the TRACE
framework consistently enhances task complexity while improving the reliability
of correctness through validatable execution trajectories. This work marks a
paradigm shift from static, manually curated benchmarks to dynamic,
self-evolving evaluation systems, providing a sustainable and challenging
runway for agent development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估AI回答患者健康问题的黄金标准——人工专家评审——耗时耗力且难以扩展，需要寻找可靠的自动化评估方法。

Method: 通过100个患者案例收集28个AI系统的2800个回答，从三个维度评估：是否回答问题、是否恰当使用临床记录证据、是否使用一般医学知识，并使用临床医生撰写的参考答案作为评估基准。

Result: 自动化排名与专家评分高度一致，表明自动化评估能够可靠地反映AI系统的表现。

Conclusion: 精心设计的自动化评估可以扩展AI系统的比较评估，支持患者与临床医生的沟通。

Abstract: Automated approaches to answer patient-posed health questions are rising, but
selecting among systems requires reliable evaluation. The current gold standard
for evaluating the free-text artificial intelligence (AI) responses--human
expert review--is labor-intensive and slow, limiting scalability. Automated
metrics are promising yet variably aligned with human judgments and often
context-dependent. To address the feasibility of automating the evaluation of
AI responses to hospitalization-related questions posed by patients, we
conducted a large systematic study of evaluation approaches. Across 100 patient
cases, we collected responses from 28 AI systems (2800 total) and assessed them
along three dimensions: whether a system response (1) answers the question, (2)
appropriately uses clinical note evidence, and (3) uses general medical
knowledge. Using clinician-authored reference answers to anchor metrics,
automated rankings closely matched expert ratings. Our findings suggest that
carefully designed automated evaluation can scale comparative assessment of AI
systems and support patient-clinician communication.

TL;DR: 提出EDMS方法，通过语义丰富的状态表示和动作掩码机制，从数据中构建可解释的球员级智能体模型，提升足球战术分析的鲁棒性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则的分析方法直观但有限，现代机器学习模型缺乏明确的智能体表示。需要构建既能从数据学习，又具有战术可解释性且能在异构数据源间保持鲁棒性的球员级智能体模型。

Method: 提出可扩展决策状态（EDMS），在原始位置和速度基础上增加关系变量（如空间评分、传球和得分），结合动作掩码方案为持球和无球球员提供不同的决策集。

Result: EDMS与动作掩码相比基线持续降低了动作预测损失和时序差分误差。定性案例研究和Q值可视化显示EDMS能识别高风险高回报的战术模式。

Conclusion: EDMS方法将学习到的价值函数和动作策略映射到人类可解释的战术概念，与比赛规则对齐，支持跨数据源评估和可重复实验。

Abstract: Invasion team sports such as soccer produce a high-dimensional, strongly
coupled state space as many players continuously interact on a shared field,
challenging quantitative tactical analysis. Traditional rule-based analyses are
intuitive, while modern predictive machine learning models often perform
pattern-matching without explicit agent representations. The problem we address
is how to build player-level agent models from data, whose learned values and
policies are both tactically interpretable and robust across heterogeneous data
sources. Here, we propose Expandable Decision-Making States (EDMS), a
semantically enriched state representation that augments raw positions and
velocities with relational variables (e.g., scoring of space, pass, and score),
combined with an action-masking scheme that gives on-ball and off-ball agents
distinct decision sets. Compared to prior work, EDMS maps learned value
functions and action policies to human-interpretable tactical concepts (e.g.,
marking pressure, passing lanes, ball accessibility) instead of raw coordinate
features, and aligns agent choices with the rules of play. In the experiments,
EDMS with action masking consistently reduced both action-prediction loss and
temporal-difference (TD) error compared to the baseline. Qualitative case
studies and Q-value visualizations further indicate that EDMS highlights
high-risk, high-reward tactical patterns (e.g., fast counterattacks and
defensive breakthroughs). We also integrated our approach into an open-source
library and demonstrated compatibility with multiple commercial and open
datasets, enabling cross-provider evaluation and reproducible experiments.

TL;DR: 该论文挑战了传统观点，发现在14个不同领域中，生成式结果奖励模型(GenORM)比过程奖励模型(PRM)表现更稳健，而逐步评分会因标签噪声和长推理轨迹而表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型在测试时扩展的可靠性通常使用外部验证器或奖励模型。传统观点认为过程奖励模型(PRM)优于结果奖励模型(ORM)，但这种观点主要基于数学相关领域的证据。

Method: 在14个不同领域中对四种奖励模型变体进行统一评估：判别式ORM和PRM(DisORM, DisPRM)以及生成式ORM和PRM(GenORM, GenPRM)。

Result: 发现DisORM与DisPRM表现相当，GenPRM不具竞争力，而GenORM是最稳健的模型，在所有测试领域中都取得了显著且一致的增益。

Conclusion: 这些发现挑战了细粒度监督总是更好的普遍假设，支持在多领域部署中使用生成式结果验证。

Abstract: The reliability of large language models (LLMs) during test-time scaling is
often assessed with \emph{external verifiers} or \emph{reward models} that
distinguish correct reasoning from flawed logic. Prior work generally assumes
that process reward models (PRMs), which score every intermediate reasoning
step, outperform outcome reward models (ORMs) that assess only the final
answer. This view is based mainly on evidence from narrow, math-adjacent
domains. We present the first unified evaluation of four reward model variants,
discriminative ORM and PRM (\DisORM, \DisPRM) and generative ORM and PRM
(\GenORM, \GenPRM), across 14 diverse domains. Contrary to conventional wisdom,
we find that (i) \DisORM performs on par with \DisPRM, (ii) \GenPRM is not
competitive, and (iii) overall, \GenORM is the most robust, yielding
significant and consistent gains across every tested domain. We attribute this
to PRM-style stepwise scoring, which inherits label noise from LLM
auto-labeling and has difficulty evaluating long reasoning trajectories,
including those involving self-correcting reasoning. Our theoretical analysis
shows that step-wise aggregation compounds errors as reasoning length grows,
and our empirical observations confirm this effect. These findings challenge
the prevailing assumption that fine-grained supervision is always better and
support generative outcome verification for multi-domain deployment. We
publicly release our code, datasets, and checkpoints at
\href{https://github.com/db-Lee/Multi-RM}{\underline{\small\texttt{https://github.com/db-Lee/Multi-RM}}}

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了VIRTUE视觉交互文本图像通用嵌入器，将分割模型和视觉语言模型扩展到表示学习领域，支持用户通过视觉提示指定感兴趣区域，在36个通用任务和5个视觉交互任务上取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有嵌入模型缺乏视觉交互能力来指定用户感兴趣区域，限制了其在局部定位和实体级信息学习方面的应用潜力。

Method: 结合分割模型处理视觉提示以精确定位图像特定区域，扩展视觉语言模型到表示学习领域，处理复杂和模糊场景。

Result: 在36个通用MMEB任务上提升3.1%-8.5%，在5个视觉交互SCaR任务上提升15.2%-20.3%，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: VIRTUE成功将视觉交互能力引入嵌入模型，解锁了基于用户意图局部定位的新应用，并增强了实体级信息学习能力。

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning models have demonstrated successful
operation across complex tasks, and the integration of vision-language models
(VLMs) has further enabled embedding models with instruction-following
capabilities. However, existing embedding models lack visual-interactive
capabilities to specify regions of interest from users (e.g., point, bounding
box, mask), which have been explored in generative models to broaden their
human-interactive applicability. Equipping embedding models with visual
interactions not only would unlock new applications with localized grounding of
user intent, which remains unexplored, but also enable the models to learn
entity-level information within images to complement their global
representations for conventional embedding tasks. In this paper, we propose a
novel Visual-InteRactive Text-Image Universal Embedder (VIRTUE) that extends
the capabilities of the segmentation model and the vision-language model to the
realm of representation learning. In VIRTUE, the segmentation model can process
visual prompts that pinpoint specific regions within an image, thereby enabling
the embedder to handle complex and ambiguous scenarios more precisely. To
evaluate the visual-interaction ability of VIRTUE, we introduce a large-scale
Segmentation-and-Scene Caption Retrieval (SCaR) benchmark comprising 1M samples
that aims to retrieve the text caption by jointly considering the entity with a
specific object and image scene. VIRTUE consistently achieves a
state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements across 36 universal
MMEB (3.1%-8.5%) and five visual-interactive SCaR (15.2%-20.3%) tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究开发了针对RAG系统的数据质量维度，通过访谈IT服务公司从业者，识别出15个跨4个处理阶段的DQ维度，发现需要在传统DQ框架中添加新维度，并采取前置质量管理策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的数据质量框架主要针对静态数据集，无法充分应对RAG系统的动态、多阶段特性，需要开发专门针对这类AI系统的DQ维度。

Method: 对16家领先IT服务公司的从业者进行半结构化访谈，通过定性内容分析归纳得出15个不同的DQ维度。

Result: 识别出15个DQ维度，分布在RAG系统的4个处理阶段：数据提取、数据转换、提示与搜索、生成；发现新维度主要集中在早期阶段，DQ问题会在管道中转化和传播。

Conclusion: 需要为RAG系统扩展传统DQ框架，采用前置质量管理策略，并实施动态、步骤感知的质量管理方法。

Abstract: Organizations increasingly adopt Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to
enhance Large Language Models with enterprise-specific knowledge. However,
current data quality (DQ) frameworks have been primarily developed for static
datasets, and only inadequately address the dynamic, multi-stage nature of RAG
systems. This study aims to develop DQ dimensions for this new type of AI-based
systems. We conduct 16 semi-structured interviews with practitioners of leading
IT service companies. Through a qualitative content analysis, we inductively
derive 15 distinct DQ dimensions across the four processing stages of RAG
systems: data extraction, data transformation, prompt & search, and generation.
Our findings reveal that (1) new dimensions have to be added to traditional DQ
frameworks to also cover RAG contexts; (2) these new dimensions are
concentrated in early RAG steps, suggesting the need for front-loaded quality
management strategies, and (3) DQ issues transform and propagate through the
RAG pipeline, necessitating a dynamic, step-aware approach to quality
management.

*Shojiro Yamabe,Jun Sakuma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 扩散语言模型(DLMs)因其迭代去噪的并行生成机制存在安全漏洞，攻击者可通过在中间步骤注入肯定令牌来绕过安全防护。本文提出了一种针对DLMs的安全对齐方法，有效缓解该漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型通过并行迭代去噪生成令牌，这种推理机制可能带来新的安全风险，特别是针对越狱攻击的脆弱性尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 提出了一种针对DLMs的安全对齐方法，训练模型从包含肯定令牌的污染中间状态生成安全响应。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著缓解了漏洞，对任务性能影响最小，并提高了对传统越狱攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 扩散语言模型需要特定的安全研究，提出的安全对齐方法能有效应对其特有的安全漏洞。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) generate tokens in parallel through
iterative denoising, which can reduce latency and enable bidirectional
conditioning. However, the safety risks posed by jailbreak attacks that exploit
this inference mechanism are not well understood. In this paper, we reveal that
DLMs have a critical vulnerability stemming from their iterative denoising
process and propose a countermeasure. Specifically, our investigation shows
that if an affirmative token for a harmful query appears at an intermediate
step, subsequent denoising can be steered toward a harmful response even in
aligned models. As a result, simply injecting such affirmative tokens can
readily bypass the safety guardrails. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the
vulnerability allows existing optimization-based jailbreak attacks to succeed
on DLMs. Building on this analysis, we propose a novel safety alignment method
tailored to DLMs that trains models to generate safe responses from
contaminated intermediate states that contain affirmative tokens. Our
experiments indicate that the proposed method significantly mitigates the
vulnerability with minimal impact on task performance. Furthermore, our method
improves robustness against conventional jailbreak attacks. Our work
underscores the need for DLM-specific safety research.

*Minki Kang,Wei-Ning Chen,Dongge Han,Huseyin A. Inan,Lukas Wutschitz,Yanzhi Chen,Robert Sim,Saravan Rajmohan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ACON是一个统一的框架，通过自然语言空间中的压缩指导优化，有效压缩环境观察和交互历史，减少内存使用26-54%同时保持任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在动态环境中部署时面临上下文长度增长的挑战，导致成本增加和长视野任务效率降低，而现有的上下文压缩方法主要关注单步任务或窄应用。

Method: ACON框架通过分析完整上下文成功但压缩上下文失败的配对轨迹，让LLM分析失败原因并相应更新压缩指导，同时将优化的LLM压缩器蒸馏到更小的模型中。

Result: 在AppWorld、OfficeBench和Multi-objective QA上的实验显示，ACON减少内存使用26-54%（峰值token），同时基本保持任务性能，蒸馏到更小压缩器时保持95%以上准确率，并将较小LM作为长视野代理的性能提升达46%。

Conclusion: ACON框架有效解决了LLM代理在长视野任务中的上下文压缩问题，显著减少内存使用同时保持性能，并能增强较小语言模型的代理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in dynamic,
real-world environments, where success requires both reasoning and effective
tool use. A central challenge for agentic tasks is the growing context length,
as agents must accumulate long histories of actions and observations. This
expansion raises costs and reduces efficiency in long-horizon tasks, yet prior
work on context compression has mostly focused on single-step tasks or narrow
applications. We introduce Agent Context Optimization (ACON), a unified
framework that optimally compresses both environment observations and
interaction histories into concise yet informative condensations. ACON
leverages compression guideline optimization in natural language space: given
paired trajectories where full context succeeds but compressed context fails,
capable LLMs analyze the causes of failure, and the compression guideline is
updated accordingly. Furthermore, we propose distilling the optimized LLM
compressor into smaller models to reduce the overhead of the additional module.
Experiments on AppWorld, OfficeBench, and Multi-objective QA show that ACON
reduces memory usage by 26-54% (peak tokens) while largely preserving task
performance, preserves over 95% of accuracy when distilled into smaller
compressors, and enhances smaller LMs as long-horizon agents with up to 46%
performance improvement.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HARPA是一个自动化科学发现系统，通过文献挖掘识别研究趋势、探索假设设计空间，并基于先前实验结果学习奖励模型，生成可测试且基于科学文献的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有自动化科学发现工具难以生成既可测试又基于科学文献的假设，且无法适应先前实验结果的问题。

Method: 采用受人类研究人员启发的构思流程：文献挖掘识别新兴趋势、探索假设设计空间、精确定位研究差距并证明设计选择。学习奖励模型基于先前实验结果对新假设评分。

Result: HARPA生成的假设驱动研究提案在可行性(+0.78)和基础性(+0.85)上显著优于基线，与ASD代理(CodeScientist)测试时成功率更高(20 vs 11/40)，失败率更低(16 vs 21/40)。奖励模型相比未训练基线获得约28%的绝对增益。

Conclusion: HARPA的方法在AI驱动的科学发现领域迈出了重要一步，能够生成更可行、更基于文献的假设，并适应实验反馈。

Abstract: While there has been a surge of interest in automated scientific discovery
(ASD), especially with the emergence of LLMs, it remains challenging for tools
to generate hypotheses that are both testable and grounded in the scientific
literature. Additionally, existing ideation tools are not adaptive to prior
experimental outcomes. We developed HARPA to address these challenges by
incorporating the ideation workflow inspired by human researchers. HARPA first
identifies emerging research trends through literature mining, then explores
hypothesis design spaces, and finally converges on precise, testable hypotheses
by pinpointing research gaps and justifying design choices. Our evaluations
show that HARPA-generated hypothesis-driven research proposals perform
comparably to a strong baseline AI-researcher across most qualitative
dimensions (e.g., specificity, novelty, overall quality), but achieve
significant gains in feasibility(+0.78, p$<0.05$, bootstrap) and groundedness
(+0.85, p$<0.01$, bootstrap) on a 10-point Likert scale. When tested with the
ASD agent (CodeScientist), HARPA produced more successful executions (20 vs. 11
out of 40) and fewer failures (16 vs. 21 out of 40), showing that expert
feasibility judgments track with actual execution success. Furthermore, to
simulate how researchers continuously refine their understanding of what
hypotheses are both testable and potentially interesting from experience, HARPA
learns a reward model that scores new hypotheses based on prior experimental
outcomes, achieving approx. a 28\% absolute gain over HARPA's untrained
baseline scorer. Together, these methods represent a step forward in the field
of AI-driven scientific discovery.

*Wei Liu,Haomei Xu,Bingqing Liu,Zhiying Deng,Haozhao Wang,Jun Wang,Ruixuan Li,Yee Whye Teh,Wee Sun Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文揭示了当前模型编辑方法的脆弱性，指出其成功很大程度上是虚幻的，因为模型倾向于利用隐藏的捷径而非真实语义来更新知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型编码了过时或不正确的知识，需要更新、删除和遗忘这些知识以解决对齐、安全等问题。模型编辑被提出作为解决方案，但作者发现现有方法的可靠性建立在脆弱基础上。

Method: 开发了一套新的评估方法，包括设计否定查询等负例测试，系统地检验模型编辑方法的鲁棒性。

Result: 研究发现即使是最先进的模型编辑方法在简单的否定查询下也会崩溃，表明编辑很可能基于捷径而非完整语义。

Conclusion: 模型编辑可能建立在捷径而非真实语义基础上，这从根本上挑战了当前模型编辑文献的可行性，需要在进一步推进前重新考虑其基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) inevitably encode outdated or incorrect
knowledge. Updating, deleting, and forgetting such knowledge is important for
alignment, safety, and other issues. To address this issue, model editing has
emerged as a promising paradigm: by precisely editing a small subset of
parameters such that a specific fact is updated while preserving other
knowledge. Despite its great success reported in previous papers, we find the
apparent reliability of editing rests on a fragile foundation and the current
literature is largely driven by illusory success. The fundamental goal of
steering the model's output toward a target with minimal modification would
encourage exploiting hidden shortcuts, rather than utilizing real semantics.
This problem directly challenges the feasibility of the current model editing
literature at its very foundation, as shortcuts are inherently at odds with
robust knowledge integration. Coincidentally, this issue has long been obscured
by evaluation frameworks that lack the design of negative examples. To uncover
it, we systematically develop a suite of new evaluation methods. Strikingly, we
find that state-of-the-art approaches collapse even under the simplest negation
queries. Our empirical evidence shows that editing is likely to be based on
shortcuts rather than full semantics, calling for an urgent reconsideration of
the very basis of model editing before further advancements can be meaningfully
pursued.

TL;DR: CDDM是一种用于实时轻量级轨迹预测的新方法，通过协作渐进蒸馏技术，在减少采样步数的同时压缩模型规模，实现了161倍压缩和31倍加速，在保持高精度的同时达到9ms延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在概率轨迹预测中表现出色，但其大模型尺寸和缓慢采样过程阻碍了实际部署。需要开发既能保持高性能又适合实时应用的轻量级预测方法。

Method: 基于协作渐进蒸馏(CPD)，CDDM逐步将知识从高容量教师扩散模型转移到轻量级学生模型，同时减少采样步数和模型规模。引入双信号正则化蒸馏损失，结合教师和真实数据的指导，防止过拟合并确保鲁棒性能。

Result: 在ETH-UCY行人基准和nuScenes车辆基准上的实验表明，CDDM实现了最先进的预测精度。蒸馏后的CDDM在行人轨迹上保留了基线模型96.2%的ADE和95.5%的FDE性能，仅需231K参数和4或2个采样步数，对应161倍压缩、31倍加速和9ms延迟。

Conclusion: CDDM通过桥接高性能生成模型与实际部署约束，为自动驾驶车辆和智能交通系统实现了资源高效的概览预测，在保持多样性和准确性的同时满足了实时性要求。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a fundamental task in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), supporting efficient motion planning
and real-time traffic safety management. Diffusion models have recently
demonstrated strong performance in probabilistic trajectory prediction, but
their large model size and slow sampling process hinder real-world deployment.
This paper proposes Collaborative-Distilled Diffusion Models (CDDM), a novel
method for real-time and lightweight trajectory prediction. Built upon
Collaborative Progressive Distillation (CPD), CDDM progressively transfers
knowledge from a high-capacity teacher diffusion model to a lightweight student
model, jointly reducing both the number of sampling steps and the model size
across distillation iterations. A dual-signal regularized distillation loss is
further introduced to incorporate guidance from both the teacher and
ground-truth data, mitigating potential overfitting and ensuring robust
performance. Extensive experiments on the ETH-UCY pedestrian benchmark and the
nuScenes vehicle benchmark demonstrate that CDDM achieves state-of-the-art
prediction accuracy. The well-distilled CDDM retains 96.2% and 95.5% of the
baseline model's ADE and FDE performance on pedestrian trajectories, while
requiring only 231K parameters and 4 or 2 sampling steps, corresponding to 161x
compression, 31x acceleration, and 9 ms latency. Qualitative results further
show that CDDM generates diverse and accurate trajectories under dynamic agent
behaviors and complex social interactions. By bridging high-performing
generative models with practical deployment constraints, CDDM enables
resource-efficient probabilistic prediction for AVs and ITS. Code is available

*Alessio Devoto,Maximilian Jeblick,Simon Jégou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Expected Attention的训练免费压缩方法，通过预测未来查询如何关注KV对来估计其重要性，解决了KV缓存内存消耗问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存的内存消耗是大型语言模型推理效率的主要瓶颈，现有基于注意力分数的KV缓存修剪方法面临实际限制：未来token的注意力分数在压缩时不可用，且现代实现如Flash Attention不生成完整的注意力矩阵。

Method: 利用LLM激活的分布特性，以闭式形式计算每个KV对的期望注意力分数，基于这些分数进行原则性排序和修剪，对残差流影响最小。

Result: 该方法在预填充和解码阶段都能无缝运行，在两个场景中都持续优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 开发了KVPress库，包含20多种技术，供研究人员实现和基准测试KV缓存压缩方法。

Abstract: Memory consumption of the Key-Value (KV) cache represents a major bottleneck
for efficient large language model inference. While attention-score-based KV
cache pruning shows promise, it faces critical practical limitations: attention
scores from future tokens are unavailable during compression, and modern
implementations like Flash Attention do not materialize the full attention
matrix, making past scores inaccessible. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce $\textbf{Expected Attention, a training-free compression method}$
that estimates KV pairs importance by predicting how future queries will attend
to them. Our approach leverages the distributional properties of LLM
activations to compute expected attention scores in closed form for each KV
pair. These scores enable principled ranking and pruning of KV pairs with
minimal impact on the residual stream, achieving effective compression without
performance degradation. Importantly, our method operates seamlessly across
both prefilling and decoding phases, consistently outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines in both scenarios. Finally, $\textbf{we release
KVPress, a comprehensive library to enable researchers to implement and
benchmark KV cache compression methods, already including more than 20
techniques}$.

Abstract: Understanding the inner workings of deep learning models is crucial for
advancing artificial intelligence, particularly in high-stakes fields such as
healthcare, where accurate explanations are as vital as precision. This paper
introduces Batch-CAM, a novel training paradigm that fuses a batch
implementation of the Grad-CAM algorithm with a prototypical reconstruction
loss. This combination guides the model to focus on salient image features,
thereby enhancing its performance across classification tasks. Our results
demonstrate that Batch-CAM achieves a simultaneous improvement in accuracy and

ensuring models learn from evidence-relevant information,this approach makes a

TL;DR: 提出了一种迭代式相关区域(RZ)缩减方法，通过逐步限制搜索区域来减小RZ大小，从而提高策略重用效率和剪枝效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有相关区域(RZ)方法虽然能显著减少搜索空间，但RZ大小不唯一且不同解决方案会产生不同大小的RZ。较小的RZ更有利于重用和剪枝效率。

Method: 设计了迭代RZ缩减方法，通过重复求解同一位置并逐步限制参与区域，引导求解器找到更小的RZ。包含三种约束生成策略，并集成了RZ模式表以充分利用过往解决方案。

Result: 在7x7 Killall-Go实验中，平均RZ大小减少到原始的85.95%。缩减后的RZ可作为可重用知识永久存储，用于未来更大棋盘或不同开局情况的求解任务。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效减小相关区域大小，提高策略重用效率，并为未来游戏求解任务提供可复用的知识基础。

Abstract: Game solving aims to find the optimal strategies for all players and
determine the theoretical outcome of a game. However, due to the exponential
growth of game trees, many games remain unsolved, even though methods like
AlphaZero have demonstrated super-human level in game playing. The
Relevance-Zone (RZ) is a local strategy reuse technique that restricts the
search to only the regions relevant to the outcome, significantly reducing the
search space. However, RZs are not unique. Different solutions may result in
RZs of varying sizes. Smaller RZs are generally more favorable, as they
increase the chance of reuse and improve pruning efficiency. To this end, we
propose an iterative RZ reduction method that repeatedly solves the same
position while gradually restricting the region involved, guiding the solver
toward smaller RZs. We design three constraint generation strategies and
integrate an RZ Pattern Table to fully leverage past solutions. In experiments
on 7x7 Killall-Go, our method reduces the average RZ size to 85.95% of the
original. Furthermore, the reduced RZs can be permanently stored as reusable
knowledge for future solving tasks, especially for larger board sizes or
different openings.

Conclusion: ACPO通过自适应学习策略有效解决了现有RL算法的局限性，为复杂推理任务的视觉语言模型对齐提供了更优的解决方案

Abstract: Aligning large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) for complex reasoning via
reinforcement learning is often hampered by the limitations of existing policy
optimization algorithms, such as static training schedules and the rigid,
uniform clipping mechanism in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). In this work,
we introduce Adaptive Curriculum Policy Optimization (ACPO), a novel framework
that addresses these challenges through a dual-component adaptive learning
strategy. First, ACPO employs a dynamic curriculum that orchestrates a
principled transition from a stable, near on-policy exploration phase to an
efficient, off-policy exploitation phase by progressively increasing sample
reuse. Second, we propose an Advantage-Aware Adaptive Clipping (AAAC) mechanism
that replaces the fixed clipping hyperparameter with dynamic, sample-wise
bounds modulated by the normalized advantage of each token. This allows for
more granular and robust policy updates, enabling larger gradients for
high-potential samples while safeguarding against destructive ones. We conduct
extensive experiments on a suite of challenging multimodal reasoning
benchmarks, including MathVista, LogicVista, and MMMU-Pro. Results demonstrate
that ACPO consistently outperforms strong baselines such as DAPO and PAPO,
achieving state-of-the-art performance, accelerated convergence, and superior
training stability.

Conclusion: 所提出的数据增强方法能有效提升定理证明模型的鲁棒性和性能，在多个基准测试上超越了同类规模模型，包括推理型模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for formal theorem proving have shown
significant promise, yet they often lack generalizability and are fragile to
even minor transformations of problem statements. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel data augmentation pipeline designed to enhance model
robustness from two perspectives: symmetry and difficulty. From the symmetry
perspective, we propose two complementary methods: EvolAST, an Abstract Syntax
Tree (AST) based approach that targets syntactic symmetry to generate
semantically equivalent problem variants, and EvolDomain, which leverages LLMs
to address semantic symmetry by translating theorems across mathematical
domains. From the difficulty perspective, we propose EvolDifficulty, which uses
carefully designed evolutionary instructions to guide LLMs in generating new
theorems with a wider range of difficulty. We then use the evolved data to
train EvolProver, a 7B-parameter non-reasoning theorem prover. EvolProver
establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on FormalMATH-Lite with a 53.8%
pass@32 rate, surpassing all models of comparable size, including
reasoning-based models. It also sets new SOTA records for non-reasoning models
on MiniF2F-Test (69.8% pass@32), Ineq-Comp-Seed (52.2% pass@32), and
Ineq-Comp-Transformed (34.0% pass@32). Ablation studies further confirm our
data augmentation pipeline's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks.

Motivation: DDIM反演技术使恶意用户能轻松合成虚假内容，现有防御方法因目标与去噪轨迹不匹配而效果有限。

Method: 提出DIA攻击方法，直接攻击DDIM反演的集成轨迹路径，而非单个步骤。

Result: DIA在多种编辑方法上均能有效破坏图像编辑过程，性能超越AdvDM和Photoguard等现有防御方法。

Conclusion: DIA框架为行业和研究社区提供了实用的防御方法，对抗AI的恶意使用。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown to be strong representation learners, showcasing
state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains. Aside from accelerated
sampling, DDIM also enables the inversion of real images back to their latent
codes. A direct inheriting application of this inversion operation is real
image editing, where the inversion yields latent trajectories to be utilized
during the synthesis of the edited image. Unfortunately, this practical tool
has enabled malicious users to freely synthesize misinformative or deepfake
contents with greater ease, which promotes the spread of unethical and abusive,
as well as privacy-, and copyright-infringing contents. While defensive
algorithms such as AdvDM and Photoguard have been shown to disrupt the
diffusion process on these images, the misalignment between their objectives
and the iterative denoising trajectory at test time results in weak disruptive
performance.In this work, we present the DDIM Inversion Attack (DIA) that
attacks the integrated DDIM trajectory path. Our results support the effective
disruption, surpassing previous defensive methods across various editing
methods. We believe that our frameworks and results can provide practical
defense methods against the malicious use of AI for both the industry and the
research community. Our code is available here:

Result: 研究发现AI工具可以简化任务并增强学习，但也存在学生对技术过度依赖的风险，可能阻碍基本认知和问题解决能力的发展。

Conclusion: AI可以成为教育中的宝贵资产，但需要负责任地使用，考虑伦理问题，并调整评估方法，确保AI补充而非替代基本学习过程。

Abstract: This study explores the integration of AI, particularly large language models
(LLMs) like ChatGPT, into educational settings, focusing on the implications
for teaching and learning. Through interviews with course coordinators from
data science courses at Wageningen University, this research identifies both
the benefits and challenges associated with AI in the classroom. While AI tools
can streamline tasks and enhance learning, concerns arise regarding students'
overreliance on these technologies, potentially hindering the development of
essential cognitive and problem solving skills. The study highlights the
importance of responsible AI usage, ethical considerations, and the need for
adapting assessment methods to ensure educational outcomes are met. With
careful integration, AI can be a valuable asset in education, provided it is
used to complement rather than replace fundamental learning processes.

Conclusion: ChemX基准是推进化学自动化信息提取的关键资源，为有效评估策略提供了宝贵见解。

Abstract: The emergence of agent-based systems represents a significant advancement in
artificial intelligence, with growing applications in automated data
extraction. However, chemical information extraction remains a formidable
challenge due to the inherent heterogeneity of chemical data. Current
agent-based approaches, both general-purpose and domain-specific, exhibit
limited performance in this domain. To address this gap, we present ChemX, a
comprehensive collection of 10 manually curated and domain-expert-validated
datasets focusing on nanomaterials and small molecules. These datasets are
designed to rigorously evaluate and enhance automated extraction methodologies
in chemistry. To demonstrate their utility, we conduct an extensive
benchmarking study comparing existing state-of-the-art agentic systems such as
ChatGPT Agent and chemical-specific data extraction agents. Additionally, we
introduce our own single-agent approach that enables precise control over
document preprocessing prior to extraction. We further evaluate the performance
of modern baselines, such as GPT-5 and GPT-5 Thinking, to compare their
capabilities with agentic approaches. Our empirical findings reveal persistent
challenges in chemical information extraction, particularly in processing
domain-specific terminology, complex tabular and schematic representations, and
context-dependent ambiguities. The ChemX benchmark serves as a critical
resource for advancing automated information extraction in chemistry,
challenging the generalization capabilities of existing methods, and providing
valuable insights into effective evaluation strategies.

TL;DR: 比较加权知识库与c-representations两种处理不一致知识库的方法，分析它们在语义结构和推理上的等价性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在知识库不一致的情况下，需要形式化方法来处理冲突。加权知识库和c-representations都提供了数值化处理不一致性的方法，但来自不同研究领域，需要比较它们的语义等价性

Method: 在语义层面比较两种方法：加权知识库通过权重和成本函数，c-representations通过惩罚值分配排名。分析在特定条件下两种方法能否生成相同的解释排序

Result: 证明在特定条件下，加权知识库和一组可废止条件可以生成相同的解释排序，实现语义结构的相对成本等价。某些推理概念在两种形式化中可等价表达

Conclusion: 两种方法在语义层面存在等价关系，这一发现有助于加权知识库和c-representations两个领域的进一步研究

Abstract: Weighted-knowledge bases and cost-based semantics represent a recent
formalism introduced by Bienvenu et al. for Ontology Mediated Data Querying in
the case where a given knowledge base is inconsistent. This is done by adding a
weight to each statement in the knowledge base (KB), and then giving each DL
interpretation a cost based on how often it breaks rules in the KB. In this
paper we compare this approach with c-representations, a form of non-monotonic
reasoning originally introduced by Kern-Isberner. c-Representations describe a
means to interpret defeasible concept inclusions in the first-order case. This
is done by assigning a numerical ranking to each interpretations via penalties
for each violated conditional. We compare these two approaches on a semantic
level. In particular, we show that under certain conditions a weighted
knowledge base and a set of defeasible conditionals can generate the same
ordering on interpretations, and therefore an equivalence of semantic
structures up to relative cost. Moreover, we compare entailment described in
both cases, where certain notions are equivalently expressible in both
formalisms. Our results have the potential to benefit further work on both
cost-based semantics and c-representations

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无监督评估分类器的逻辑框架，通过分析专家间的一致与分歧来推断可能的正确评估结果，并构建了无需知识的警报系统来检测LLM评委是否违反用户设定的评分阈值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估方法需要真实标签，但在实际应用中往往难以获得。本文旨在开发一种仅基于分类器决策一致性和分歧的无监督评估方法，利用逻辑一致性来推断可能的正确评估。

Method: 将分类器决策的一致性和分歧统计作为线性规划问题的输入，在整数空间中建模可能的正确或错误响应。使用逻辑约束（不等式）和普遍适用的线性等式（公理）来构建评估框架。

Result: 开发了无需知识的警报系统，能够检测LLM评委是否违反用户设定的最低评分阈值，证明了该无监督评估方法的实际效用。

Conclusion: 基于逻辑一致性的无监督评估方法能够有效利用分类器间的一致与分歧信息，为缺乏真实标签的场景提供了实用的评估工具，特别是在LLM作为评委的应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: If two experts disagree on a test, we may conclude both cannot be 100 per
cent correct. But if they completely agree, no possible evaluation can be
excluded. This asymmetry in the utility of agreements versus disagreements is
explored here by formalizing a logic of unsupervised evaluation for
classifiers. Its core problem is computing the set of group evaluations that
are logically consistent with how we observe them agreeing and disagreeing in
their decisions. Statistical summaries of their aligned decisions are inputs
into a Linear Programming problem in the integer space of possible correct or
incorrect responses given true labels. Obvious logical constraints, such as,
the number of correct responses cannot exceed the number of observed responses,
are inequalities. But in addition, there are axioms, universally applicable
linear equalities that apply to all finite tests. The practical and immediate
utility of this approach to unsupervised evaluation using only logical
consistency is demonstrated by building no-knowledge alarms that can detect
when one or more LLMs-as-Judges are violating a minimum grading threshold
specified by the user.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式能源资源特别是可再生能源的日益集成给电力系统保护带来了重大挑战，基于固定阈值的传统保护方案无法在动态条件下可靠识别和定位短路故障，而机器学习方法虽然前景广阔但缺乏系统性基准研究。

Method: 使用电压和电流波形数据，将其分割为10-50毫秒的滑动窗口，在实时约束下评估经典机器学习模型在故障分类和故障定位任务中的性能。

Result: 最佳故障分类模型达到F1分数0.992±0.001，最佳故障定位模型达到R2分数0.806±0.008，平均处理时间为0.563毫秒。

Conclusion: 该研究为电力系统保护中的机器学习应用提供了首个系统性基准，证明了经典机器学习模型在故障分类和定位任务中的有效性，特别是在实时性能方面表现优异。

Abstract: The increasing integration of distributed energy resources (DERs),
particularly renewables, poses significant challenges for power system
protection, with fault classification (FC) and fault localization (FL) being
among the most critical tasks. Conventional protection schemes, based on fixed
thresholds, cannot reliably identify and localize short circuits with the
increasing complexity of the grid under dynamic conditions. Machine learning
(ML) offers a promising alternative; however, systematic benchmarks across
models and settings remain limited. This work presents, for the first time, a
comparative benchmarking study of classical ML models for FC and FL in power
system protection based on EMT data. Using voltage and current waveforms
segmented into sliding windows of 10 ms to 50 ms, we evaluate models under
realistic real-time constraints. Performance is assessed in terms of accuracy,
robustness to window size, and runtime efficiency. The best-performing FC model
achieved an F1 score of 0.992$\pm$0.001, while the top FL model reached an R2
of 0.806$\pm$0.008 with a mean processing time of 0.563 ms.

Motivation: 加密货币市场中Pump and Dump操纵事件的稀缺性导致严重的类别不平衡，阻碍了准确的检测。

Method: 应用合成少数类过采样技术(SMOTE)，并评估先进的集成学习模型来区分操纵交易行为与正常市场活动。

Result: SMOTE显著提升了所有模型检测P&D事件的能力，XGBoost和LightGBM分别达到94.87%和93.59%的高召回率，并表现出快速计算性能。

Conclusion: 数据平衡技术与集成方法相结合显著改善了操纵活动的早期检测，有助于建立更公平、透明和稳定的加密货币市场。

Abstract: This study aims to detect pump and dump (P&D) manipulation in cryptocurrency
markets, where the scarcity of such events causes severe class imbalance and
hinders accurate detection. To address this issue, the Synthetic Minority
Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied, and advanced ensemble learning
models were evaluated to distinguish manipulative trading behavior from normal
market activity. The experimental results show that applying SMOTE greatly
enhanced the ability of all models to detect P&D events by increasing recall
and improving the overall balance between precision and recall. In particular,
XGBoost and LightGBM achieved high recall rates (94.87% and 93.59%,
respectively) with strong F1-scores and demonstrated fast computational
performance, making them suitable for near real time surveillance. These
findings indicate that integrating data balancing techniques with ensemble
methods significantly improves the early detection of manipulative activities,
contributing to a fairer, more transparent, and more stable cryptocurrency
market.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型数量的激增，如何有效管理和利用这些庞大资源成为一个重要挑战。需要学习紧凑的LLM能力表示来促进下游任务。

Method: 使用项目反应理论框架，将模型正确回答查询的概率建模为三个因素的函数：模型的多技能能力向量、查询的区分度向量和查询难度标量。采用混合专家网络联合学习这些参数。

Result: 实验表明该方法在模型路由和基准精度预测方面达到了最先进的性能，学习到的参数能够编码有意义的模型能力和查询特征信息。

Conclusion: 提出的基于IRT的框架能够有效学习LLM能力的紧凑表示，在模型管理和性能预测任务中表现出色，且学习到的参数具有可解释性。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a surge in the number of large language models
(LLMs), yet efficiently managing and utilizing these vast resources remains a
significant challenge. In this work, we explore how to learn compact
representations of LLM abilities that can facilitate downstream tasks, such as
model routing and performance prediction on new benchmarks. We frame this
problem as estimating the probability that a given model will correctly answer
a specific query. Inspired by the item response theory (IRT) in psychometrics,
we model this probability as a function of three key factors: (i) the model's
multi-skill ability vector, (2) the query's discrimination vector that
separates models of differing skills, and (3) the query's difficulty scalar. To
learn these parameters jointly, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) network
that couples model- and query-level embeddings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach leads to state-of-the-art performance in both
model routing and benchmark accuracy prediction. Moreover, analysis validates
that the learned parameters encode meaningful, interpretable information about
model capabilities and query characteristics.

Result: 在真实和合成数据上的评估表明，AIDE能有效识别数据转换和模型，发现有趣的数据模式。

Conclusion: AIDE为自动知识发现提供了坚实基础，其可扩展框架支持未来集成更多模式提取策略和领域知识。

Abstract: Organizations are increasingly focused on leveraging data from their
processes to gain insights and drive decision-making. However, converting this
data into actionable knowledge remains a difficult and time-consuming task.
There is often a gap between the volume of data collected and the ability to
process and understand it, which automated knowledge discovery aims to fill.
Automated knowledge discovery involves complex open problems, including
effectively navigating data, building models to extract implicit relationships,
and considering subjective goals and knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a
novel method for Automated Insights and Data Exploration (AIDE), that serves as
a robust foundation for tackling these challenges through the use of Monte
Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). We evaluate AIDE using both real-world and synthetic
data, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying data transformations and
models that uncover interesting data patterns. Among its strengths, AIDE's
MCTS-based framework offers significant extensibility, allowing for future
integration of additional pattern extraction strategies and domain knowledge.
This makes AIDE a valuable step towards developing a comprehensive solution for
automated knowledge discovery.

TL;DR: 提出了FusionAdapter方法，用于多模态知识图谱中的少样本关系学习，通过适配器模块和融合策略有效整合多模态信息，在低资源设置下提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MMKG方法主要将多模态对齐到共享空间，忽略了特定模态的独特贡献，在低资源设置下性能受限。

Method: 引入适配器模块使每个模态能够高效适应未见关系，并提出融合策略在整合多模态实体表示的同时保留模态特定特征。

Result: 在两个基准MMKG数据集上的广泛实验表明，FusionAdapter优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 通过有效适应和融合多模态信息，FusionAdapter在最小监督下提高了对新关系的泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs) incorporate various modalities, including
text and images, to enhance entity and relation representations. Notably,
different modalities for the same entity often present complementary and
diverse information. However, existing MMKG methods primarily align modalities
into a shared space, which tends to overlook the distinct contributions of
specific modalities, limiting their performance particularly in low-resource
settings. To address this challenge, we propose FusionAdapter for the learning
of few-shot relationships (FSRL) in MMKG. FusionAdapter introduces (1) an
adapter module that enables efficient adaptation of each modality to unseen
relations and (2) a fusion strategy that integrates multimodal entity
representations while preserving diverse modality-specific characteristics. By
effectively adapting and fusing information from diverse modalities,
FusionAdapter improves generalization to novel relations with minimal
supervision. Extensive experiments on two benchmark MMKG datasets demonstrate
that FusionAdapter achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗模仿学习(AIL)方法虽然有效但被认为不稳定。现有研究主要关注密度比估计，而奖励分配函数对训练动态和最终策略性能的影响被忽视，通常依赖人工设计。

Method: 采用LLM引导的进化框架，在奖励分配函数空间中进行高效探索，基于模仿策略的性能直接发现数据驱动的奖励分配函数，提出了首个元学习的AIL算法DAIL。

Result: DAIL在未见过的环境和策略优化算法中表现出良好的泛化能力，超越了当前最先进的人工设计基线方法，并实现了更稳定的训练。

Conclusion: DAIL通过自动发现奖励分配函数，为AIL的稳定性提供了新的见解，证明了数据驱动方法在对抗模仿学习中的有效性。

Abstract: Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL) methods, while effective in settings
with limited expert demonstrations, are often considered unstable. These
approaches typically decompose into two components: Density Ratio (DR)
estimation $\frac{\rho_E}{\rho_{\pi}}$, where a discriminator estimates the
relative occupancy of state-action pairs under the policy versus the expert;
and Reward Assignment (RA), where this ratio is transformed into a reward
signal used to train the policy. While significant research has focused on
improving density estimation, the role of reward assignment in influencing
training dynamics and final policy performance has been largely overlooked. RA
functions in AIL are typically derived from divergence minimization objectives,
relying heavily on human design and ingenuity. In this work, we take a
different approach: we investigate the discovery of data-driven RA functions,
i.e, based directly on the performance of the resulting imitation policy. To
this end, we leverage an LLM-guided evolutionary framework that efficiently
explores the space of RA functions, yielding \emph{Discovered Adversarial
Imitation Learning} (DAIL), the first meta-learnt AIL algorithm. Remarkably,
DAIL generalises across unseen environments and policy optimization algorithms,
outperforming the current state-of-the-art of \emph{human-designed} baselines.
Finally, we analyse why DAIL leads to more stable training, offering novel
insights into the role of RA functions in the stability of AIL. Code is
publicly available: https://github.com/shshnkreddy/DAIL.

Motivation: 现有的深度学习分离方法在生成切割平面时多样性不足，产生的切割数量少于预期，需要提高模型对生成子集的敏感性。

Method: 1. 在图粗化过程中引入随机边选择替代贪心方法；2. 提出GraphCHiP算法，利用粗化历史识别RCIs和FCIs。

Result: 在随机生成的CVRP实例上，相比现有神经分离方法，该方法能有效减小对偶间隙，并首次成功识别出有效的FCIs。

Conclusion: 通过测试时随机搜索增强训练模型性能是有效的替代方案，能够生成更多样化的切割平面，包括具有挑战性的FCIs。

Abstract: The identification of valid inequalities, such as the rounded capacity
inequalities (RCIs), is a key component of cutting plane methods for the
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). While a deep learning-based
separation method can learn to find high-quality cuts, our analysis reveals
that the model produces fewer cuts than expected because it is insufficiently
sensitive to generate a diverse set of generated subsets. This paper proposes
an alternative: enhancing the performance of a trained model at inference time
through a new test-time search with stochasticity. First, we introduce
stochastic edge selection into the graph coarsening procedure, replacing the
previously proposed greedy approach. Second, we propose the Graph Coarsening
History-based Partitioning (GraphCHiP) algorithm, which leverages coarsening
history to identify not only RCIs but also, for the first time, the Framed
capacity inequalities (FCIs). Experiments on randomly generated CVRP instances
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing the dual gap compared
to the existing neural separation method. Additionally, our method discovers
effective FCIs on a specific instance, despite the challenging nature of
identifying such cuts.

Conclusion: QUASAR通过结合工具增强和强化学习，显著提升了量子电路生成的语法和语义性能，为自动量子电路设计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Designing and optimizing task-specific quantum circuits are crucial to
leverage the advantage of quantum computing. Recent large language model
(LLM)-based quantum circuit generation has emerged as a promising automatic
solution. However, the fundamental challenges remain unaddressed: (i)
parameterized quantum gates require precise numerical values for optimal
performance, which also depend on multiple aspects, including the number of
quantum gates, their parameters, and the layout/depth of the circuits. (ii)
LLMs often generate low-quality or incorrect quantum circuits due to the lack
of quantum domain-specific knowledge. We propose QUASAR, an agentic
reinforcement learning (RL) framework for quantum circuits generation and
optimization based on tool-augmented LLMs. To align the LLM with
quantum-specific knowledge and improve the generated quantum circuits, QUASAR
designs (i) a quantum circuit verification approach with external quantum
simulators and (ii) a sophisticated hierarchical reward mechanism in RL
training. Extensive evaluation shows improvements in both syntax and semantic
performance of the generated quantum circuits. When augmenting a 4B LLM, QUASAR
has achieved the validity of 99.31% in Pass@1 and 100% in Pass@10,
outperforming industrial LLMs of GPT-4o, GPT-5 and DeepSeek-V3 and several
supervised-fine-tuning (SFT)-only and RL-only baselines.

Result: 在模拟罕见病检测数据集上，相比基线联邦学习准确率提升10%，客户端掉线率降低50%以上，且隐私-效用权衡在临床可接受范围内。

Conclusion: AFFR为罕见病的公平可信联邦诊断提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Rare-disease diagnosis remains one of the most pressing challenges in digital
health, hindered by extreme data scarcity, privacy concerns, and the limited
resources of edge devices. This paper proposes the Adaptive Federated Few-Shot
Rare-Disease Diagnosis (AFFR) framework, which integrates three pillars: (i)
few-shot federated optimization with meta-learning to generalize from limited
patient samples, (ii) energy-aware client scheduling to mitigate device
dropouts and ensure balanced participation, and (iii) secure aggregation with
calibrated differential privacy to safeguard sensitive model updates. Unlike
prior work that addresses these aspects in isolation, AFFR unifies them into a
modular pipeline deployable on real-world clinical networks. Experimental
evaluation on simulated rare-disease detection datasets demonstrates up to 10%
improvement in accuracy compared with baseline FL, while reducing client
dropouts by over 50% without degrading convergence. Furthermore,
privacy-utility trade-offs remain within clinically acceptable bounds. These
findings highlight AFFR as a practical pathway for equitable and trustworthy
federated diagnosis of rare conditions.

Abstract: This paper presents a practical architecture for after-sales demand
forecasting and monitoring that unifies a revenue- and cluster-aware ensemble
of statistical, machine-learning, and deep-learning models with a role-driven
analytics layer for scorecards and trend diagnostics. The framework ingests
exogenous signals (installed base, pricing, macro indicators, life cycle,
seasonality) and treats COVID-19 as a distinct regime, producing country-part
forecasts with calibrated intervals. A Pareto-aware segmentation forecasts
high-revenue items individually and pools the long tail via clusters, while
horizon-aware ensembling aligns weights with business-relevant losses (e.g.,
WMAPE). Beyond forecasts, a performance scorecard delivers decision-focused
insights: accuracy within tolerance thresholds by revenue share and count, bias
decomposition (over- vs under-forecast), geographic and product-family
hotspots, and ranked root causes tied to high-impact part-country pairs. A
trend module tracks trajectories of MAPE/WMAPE and bias across recent months,
flags entities that are improving or deteriorating, detects change points
aligned with known regimes, and attributes movements to lifecycle and seasonal
factors. LLMs are embedded in the analytics layer to generate role-aware
narratives and enforce reporting contracts. They standardize business
definitions, automate quality checks and reconciliations, and translate
quantitative results into concise, explainable summaries for planners and
executives. The system exposes a reproducible workflow -- request
specification, model execution, database-backed artifacts, and AI-generated
narratives -- so planners can move from "How accurate are we now?" to "Where is
accuracy heading and which levers should we pull?", closing the loop between
forecasting, monitoring, and inventory decisions across more than 90 countries
and about 6,000 parts.

Method: 引入监督多维缩放(SMDS)，一种模型无关的方法来自动发现特征流形，并以时间推理作为案例研究。

Result: 发现不同特征形成各种几何结构（圆形、直线、聚类），这些结构反映概念属性、跨模型稳定、支持推理，并能根据上下文动态重塑。

Conclusion: 特征流形在语言模型中发挥功能性作用，支持基于实体的推理模型，语言模型编码并转换结构化表征。

Abstract: The linear representation hypothesis states that language models (LMs) encode
concepts as directions in their latent space, forming organized,
multidimensional manifolds. Prior efforts focus on discovering specific
geometries for specific features, and thus lack generalization. We introduce
Supervised Multi-Dimensional Scaling (SMDS), a model-agnostic method to
automatically discover feature manifolds. We apply SMDS to temporal reasoning
as a case study, finding that different features form various geometric
structures such as circles, lines, and clusters. SMDS reveals many insights on
these structures: they consistently reflect the properties of the concepts they
represent; are stable across model families and sizes; actively support
reasoning in models; and dynamically reshape in response to context changes.
Together, our findings shed light on the functional role of feature manifolds,
supporting a model of entity-based reasoning in which LMs encode and transform
structured representations.

### [206] [Uncovering the Computational Ingredients of Human-Like Representations in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01030)
*Zach Studdiford,Timothy T. Rogers,Kushin Mukherjee,Siddharth Suresh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究评估了70多个不同架构的LLM在概念表示上与人类的对齐程度，发现指令微调和注意力头维度是影响对齐的关键因素，而多模态预训练和参数大小影响有限。现有基准测试无法充分衡量人机表示对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM的快速发展带来了多样化的计算要素，但尚不清楚哪些要素对构建具有人类类似表示的模型最为关键。现有的LLM基准测试不适合衡量人类与模型之间的表示对齐，使得基准分数在评估LLM是否朝着有用认知模型发展方面不可靠。

Method: 使用认知科学中成熟的triplet相似性任务，基于THINGS数据库的概念，评估了70多个在计算要素上广泛变化的模型，比较人类和模型的概念表示。

Result: 发现经过指令微调的模型和具有更大注意力头维度的模型在人机对齐方面表现最佳，而多模态预训练和参数大小对人机对齐的影响有限。现有基准测试中，MMLU比MUSR更适合捕捉表示对齐，但没有一个基准能够完全解释对齐分数的方差。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于识别推进LLM成为人类概念表示模型的最关键计算要素，并解决了LLM评估中的一个关键基准测试空白。

Abstract: The ability to translate diverse patterns of inputs into structured patterns
of behavior has been thought to rest on both humans' and machines' ability to
learn robust representations of relevant concepts. The rapid advancement of
transformer-based large language models (LLMs) has led to a diversity of
computational ingredients -- architectures, fine tuning methods, and training
datasets among others -- but it remains unclear which of these ingredients are
most crucial for building models that develop human-like representations.
Further, most current LLM benchmarks are not suited to measuring
representational alignment between humans and models, making benchmark scores
unreliable for assessing if current LLMs are making progress towards becoming
useful cognitive models. We address these limitations by first evaluating a set
of over 70 models that widely vary in their computational ingredients on a
triplet similarity task, a method well established in the cognitive sciences
for measuring human conceptual representations, using concepts from the THINGS
database. Comparing human and model representations, we find that models that
undergo instruction-finetuning and which have larger dimensionality of
attention heads are among the most human aligned, while multimodal pretraining
and parameter size have limited bearing on alignment. Correlations between
alignment scores and scores on existing benchmarks reveal that while some
benchmarks (e.g., MMLU) are better suited than others (e.g., MUSR) for
capturing representational alignment, no existing benchmark is capable of fully
accounting for the variance of alignment scores, demonstrating their
insufficiency in capturing human-AI alignment. Taken together, our findings
help highlight the computational ingredients most essential for advancing LLMs
towards models of human conceptual representation and address a key
benchmarking gap in LLM evaluation.

*Akchunya Chanchal,David A. Kelly,Hana Chockler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的前向传播范式Activation-Deactivation (AD)，通过关闭模型中与遮挡部分对应的组件来消除遮挡输入特征对模型决策的影响，解决了传统黑盒解释方法因遮挡导致分布外图像的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统黑盒解释方法依赖遮挡输入部分来生成解释，但这种方法会产生分布外图像，影响解释质量。同时，选择合适的遮挡值需要领域知识，限制了方法的实用性。

Method: 提出了ConvAD机制，可以轻松添加到任何训练好的卷积神经网络中，实现AD范式。该方法不需要额外训练或微调，通过关闭模型中与遮挡区域对应的组件来生成解释。

Result: 实验表明，AD解释在多个数据集和模型架构上都表现出更好的鲁棒性（提升高达62.5%），相比传统遮挡方法能提取更稳健的解释，且不需要领域知识。

Conclusion: ConvAD机制提供了一种更可靠的解释方法，通过消除遮挡导致的分布外问题，生成了更稳健的解释，同时保持了模型的原始决策过程不变。

Abstract: Black-box explainability methods are popular tools for explaining the
decisions of image classifiers. A major drawback of these tools is their
reliance on mutants obtained by occluding parts of the input, leading to
out-of-distribution images. This raises doubts about the quality of the
explanations. Moreover, choosing an appropriate occlusion value often requires
domain knowledge. In this paper we introduce a novel forward-pass paradigm
Activation-Deactivation (AD), which removes the effects of occluded input
features from the model's decision-making by switching off the parts of the
model that correspond to the occlusions. We introduce ConvAD, a drop-in
mechanism that can be easily added to any trained Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN), and which implements the AD paradigm. This leads to more robust
explanations without any additional training or fine-tuning. We prove that the
ConvAD mechanism does not change the decision-making process of the network. We
provide experimental evaluation across several datasets and model
architectures. We compare the quality of AD-explanations with explanations
achieved using a set of masking values, using the proxies of robustness, size,
and confidence drop-off. We observe a consistent improvement in robustness of
AD explanations (up to 62.5%) compared to explanations obtained with
occlusions, demonstrating that ConvAD extracts more robust explanations without
the need for domain knowledge.

TL;DR: 提出基于Curry-Howard对应的理论框架，将CoT推理轨迹映射为形式化类型证明结构，以验证推理的忠实性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CoT提示中生成推理轨迹的忠实性问题，提升模型可解释性和可靠性

Method: 利用Curry-Howard对应关系，将自然语言推理步骤提取并映射到形式化类型证明结构

Result: 成功将CoT轨迹转换为良好类型证明，提供可验证的计算忠实性证书

Conclusion: 该框架将叙事性解释转化为可形式验证的程序，为构建更可靠可信的AI系统提供路径

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances the reasoning capabilities of
large language models, the faithfulness of the generated rationales remains an
open problem for model interpretability. We propose a novel theoretical lens
for this problem grounded in the Curry-Howard correspondence, which posits a
direct relationship between formal proofs and computer programs. Under this
paradigm, a faithful reasoning trace is analogous to a well-typed program,
where each intermediate step corresponds to a typed logical inference. We
operationalise this analogy, presenting methods to extract and map the
informal, natural language steps of CoT into a formal, typed proof structure.
Successfully converting a CoT trace into a well-typed proof serves as a strong,
verifiable certificate of its computational faithfulness, moving beyond
heuristic interpretability towards formal verification. Our framework provides
a methodology to transform plausible narrative explanations into formally
verifiable programs, offering a path towards building more reliable and
trustworthy AI systems.

TL;DR: 提出SIRL方法，利用LLM内部的安全置信度作为自生成奖励信号，无需外部验证器即可强化安全对齐，在多种越狱攻击下保持高防御成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM安全对齐面临缺乏通用标准和可靠内容验证器的挑战，难以获得有效训练信号。研究发现对齐模型已具备内部安全信念，在拒绝有害请求时表现出高置信度。

Method: SIRL方法将模型内部的安全置信度转化为自生成奖励信号，通过强化低熵拒绝行为来教导模型信任其安全本能，无需依赖外部验证器或人工标注。

Result: 在Llama和Qwen模型上评估，SIRL对20多种越狱方法保持89%+的防御成功率，仅使用15,000个未标注提示即可超越资源密集型监督方法，同时保持数学、编程和对话基准性能。

Conclusion: 有效对齐可以从模型内部产生，为无需大量人工监督的自主、可扩展AI安全机制开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Ensuring Large Language Model (LLM) safety remains challenging due to the
absence of universal standards and reliable content validators, making it
difficult to obtain effective training signals. We discover that aligned models
already possess robust internal safety beliefs: they consistently produce
high-confidence refusals to harmful requests while exhibiting high entropy when
generating potentially dangerous content. This entropy gap reveals an untapped
signal--models intrinsically "know" when to refuse. We introduce Safety
Instincts Reinforcement Learning (SIRL), which transforms this internal
confidence into a self-generated reward signal, eliminating dependence on
external validators or human annotations. SIRL teaches models to trust their
safety instincts by reinforcing low-entropy refusal behaviors. Evaluated on
Llama and Qwen models, SIRL maintains 89%+ Defense Success Rates (DSRs) against
20+ jailbreak methods, from static prompts to adaptive attacks. Using only
15,000 unlabeled prompts, SIRL surpasses resource-intensive supervised methods
while preserving performance on mathematics, coding, and conversation
benchmarks. Our work demonstrates that effective alignment can emerge from
within, paving the way for more autonomous and robust AI safety mechanisms that
scale without extensive human oversight.

TL;DR: 提出一个双层人本生产规划框架，结合约束规划(CP)和马尔可夫决策过程(MDP)，同时优化运营效率和劳动力公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在工业制造中平衡运营效率和劳动力公平性，将机器能力、处理时间、交期等运营约束与工人偏好、经验、弹性、医疗限制等人本因素整合到生产规划中。

Method: 第一层使用约束规划(CP)进行订单-产线分配，生成高利用率的生产排程；第二层使用马尔可夫决策过程(MDP)进行工人-产线分配，整合人本因素。比较了贪婪分配、MCTS和RL三种解决方案策略。

Result: CP排程方法产生紧凑、可行的生产计划，延迟率低；MDP工人分配显著提高了公平性和偏好对齐度。领域专家认为两个组件都有效，并指出可进一步改进目标函数。

Conclusion: 结合CP和学习型决策制定为人本生产规划提供了稳健方法，能够同时优化吞吐量和劳动力福祉，为工业环境中公平高效的制造排程提供了实用基础。

Abstract: This work presents a two-layer, human-centric production planning framework
designed to optimize both operational efficiency and workforce fairness in
industrial manufacturing. The first layer formulates the Order-Line allocation
as a Constraint Programming (CP) problem, generating high-utilization
production schedules that respect machine capacities, processing times, and due
dates. The second layer models Worker-Line allocation as a Markov Decision
Process (MDP), integrating human factors such as worker preference, experience,
resilience, and medical constraints into the assignment process. Three solution
strategies, greedy allocation, MCTS, and RL, are implemented and compared
across multiple evaluation scenarios. The proposed system is validated through
16 test sessions with domain experts from the automotive industry, combining
quantitative key performance indicators (KPIs) with expert ratings. Results
indicate that the CP-based scheduling approach produces compact, feasible
production plans with low tardiness, while the MDP-based worker allocation
significantly improves fairness and preference alignment compared to baseline
approaches. Domain experts rated both the Order-Line and Worker-Line components
as effective and highlighted opportunities to further refine the objective
function to penalize excessive earliness and improve continuity in worker
assignments. Overall, the findings demonstrate that combining CP with
learning-based decision-making provides a robust approach for human-centric
production planning. The approach enables simultaneous optimization of
throughput and workforce well-being, offering a practical foundation for fair
and efficient manufacturing scheduling in industrial settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PRISM-Consult是一个临床医生对齐的专家小组架构，将紧凑的PRISM序列模型扩展为路由的领域专家家族，通过轻量级路由器将病例分派给不同专科模型，实现参数效率和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在急诊科实现安全、可审计、低延迟的大规模会诊，需要开发一个既能保持计算效率又能确保临床安全性的专家系统架构。

Method: 将病例标记化为结构化临床事件，使用轻量级路由器读取前几个标记并分派给专科专家模型（心脏血管、肺部、胃肠、肌肉骨骼、心理源性），每个专家继承PRISM的小型transformer骨干和标记模板。

Result: 在真实世界急诊科队列中，专家模型在各领域表现出平滑收敛和低开发困惑度，路由器在安全优先策略下实现高质量路由和大量计算节省。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模安全、可审计、低延迟的会诊提供了实用路径，并通过外部/时间复制、非对称生命威胁阈值和多标签仲裁等验证步骤来满足前瞻性临床部署标准。

Abstract: We present PRISM-Consult, a clinician-aligned panel-of-experts architecture
that extends the compact PRISM sequence model into a routed family of domain
specialists. Episodes are tokenized as structured clinical events; a
light-weight router reads the first few tokens and dispatches to specialist
models (Cardiac-Vascular, Pulmonary, Gastro-Oesophageal, Musculoskeletal,
Psychogenic). Each specialist inherits PRISM's small transformer backbone and
token template, enabling parameter efficiency and interpretability. On
real-world Emergency Department cohorts, specialists exhibit smooth convergence
with low development perplexities across domains, while the router achieves
high routing quality and large compute savings versus consult-all under a
safety-first policy. We detail the data methodology (initial vs. conclusive
ICD-9 families), routing thresholds and calibration, and report per-domain
results to avoid dominance by common events. The framework provides a practical
path to safe, auditable, and low-latency consult at scale, and we outline
validation steps-external/temporal replication, asymmetric life-threat
thresholds, and multi-label arbitration-to meet prospective clinical deployment
standards.

TL;DR: 提出基于LLM的智能体框架，利用网络与知识图谱的二元性，通过图遍历和上下文外壳技术实现供应链风险分析，无需微调或专用图数据库。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在处理复杂多模态金融风险数据时的局限性，标准RAG方法过于简化关系，而专业模型成本高且静态。

Method: 将供应链网络视为知识图谱，使用网络中心性评分指导图遍历提取关键风险路径，结合数值因子表和新闻数据，通过上下文外壳将定量数据转换为自然语言。

Result: 实现了轻量级方法，能够实时生成简洁、可解释且上下文丰富的风险叙述。

Conclusion: 该框架有效克服了LLM在金融风险分析中的限制，提供了一种无需昂贵资源的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with the complex, multi-modal, and
network-native data underlying financial risk. Standard Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) oversimplifies relationships, while specialist models are
costly and static. We address this gap with an LLM-centric agent framework for
supply chain risk analysis. Our core contribution is to exploit the inherent
duality between networks and knowledge graphs (KG). We treat the supply chain
network as a KG, allowing us to use structural network science principles for
retrieval. A graph traverser, guided by network centrality scores, efficiently
extracts the most economically salient risk paths. An agentic architecture
orchestrates this graph retrieval alongside data from numerical factor tables
and news streams. Crucially, it employs novel ``context shells'' -- descriptive
templates that embed raw figures in natural language -- to make quantitative
data fully intelligible to the LLM. This lightweight approach enables the model
to generate concise, explainable, and context-rich risk narratives in real-time
without costly fine-tuning or a dedicated graph database.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在证明通过精心设计的训练方法而非单纯扩大规模，可以在有限计算资源下实现前沿水平的多模态推理能力，使更多组织能够获得高性能模型。

Method: 采用三阶段渐进方法：1）深度扩展推理能力；2）分阶段持续预训练，包括基础文本视觉理解和针对空间结构、组合理解、细粒度感知的合成数据增强；3）高质量文本监督微调，涵盖数学、编程、科学和工具使用等领域的推理轨迹。

Result: 在Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index上获得52分，与DeepSeek-R1-0528相当但计算资源需求显著减少；在十个图像基准测试中，性能平均仅比Gemini-2.5-Flash和Claude Sonnet-3.7低5分，可在单GPU上部署。

Conclusion: 研究表明，精心设计的中期训练策略可以在不依赖大规模计算的情况下显著缩小能力差距，使前沿多模态推理能力对基础设施有限的组织更加可及。模型以MIT许可证开源发布。

Abstract: We present Apriel-1.5-15B-Thinker, a 15-billion parameter open-weights
multimodal reasoning model that achieves frontier-level performance through
training design rather than sheer scale. Starting from Pixtral-12B, we apply a
progressive three-stage methodology: (1) depth upscaling to expand reasoning
capacity without pretraining from scratch, (2) staged continual pre-training
that first develops foundational text and vision understanding, then enhances
visual reasoning through targeted synthetic data generation addressing spatial
structure, compositional understanding, and fine-grained perception, and (3)
high-quality text-only supervised fine-tuning on curated instruction-response
pairs with explicit reasoning traces spanning mathematics, coding, science, and
tool use. Notably, our model achieves competitive results without reinforcement
learning or preference optimization, isolating the contribution of our
data-centric continual pre-training approach. On the Artificial Analysis
Intelligence Index, Apriel-1.5-15B-Thinker attains a score of 52, matching
DeepSeek-R1-0528 despite requiring significantly fewer computational resources.
Across ten image benchmarks, its performance is on average within five points
of Gemini-2.5-Flash and Claude Sonnet-3.7, a key achievement for a model
operating within single-GPU deployment constraints. Our results demonstrate
that thoughtful mid-training 2 design can close substantial capability gaps
without massive scale, making frontier-level multimodal reasoning accessible to
organizations with limited infrastructure. We release the model checkpoint, all
training recipes, and evaluation protocols under the MIT license to to advance

TL;DR: Bridge提出了一种并行LLM推理方法，通过将批量隐藏状态视为整体张量而非独立切片，使并行响应相互依赖，从而提升响应质量和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统并行LLM推理中，N个并行响应彼此独立生成，浪费了计算资源，且无法利用其他响应中的有用信息。这与序列生成中利用过去计算的方式形成对比。

Method: 重新设计批量LLM隐藏状态为整体张量而非独立切片，仅需少量新参数（2.8%-5.1%），使并行响应相互依赖。

Result: Bridge将可验证奖励强化学习的相对平均准确率提升高达50%，并提高了正确响应的一致性。一次训练即可扩展到任意生成宽度。

Conclusion: Bridge解锁了更通用的并行扩展模式，有效利用序列间信息，兼容任何后生成聚合技术，性能优于独立生成。

Abstract: Parallel LLM inference scaling involves sampling a set of $N>1$ responses for
a single input prompt. However, these $N$ parallel responses tend to be
generated independently from each other, partitioning compute resources and
leaving potentially useful information in one generation untapped by others.
This is in contrast to response length scaling where past computation is used
in all future steps. For higher quality responses and response sets, we propose
Bridge to generate interdependent responses in parallel by rethinking batched
LLM hidden states as holistic tensors rather than independent slices. With only
a small amount (2.8%-5.1%) of new parameters, Bridge improves the relative mean
accuracy gains from reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards by up to 50%
and boosts consistency of correct responses. Trained once, Bridge scales to any
generation width, all with greater performance than independent generations,
unlocking a more general mode of parallel scaling that effectively leverages
information between sequences, compatible with any post-generation aggregation
technique.

Conclusion: Object-AVEdit成功实现了对象级音视频编辑，通过创新的音频生成模型和编辑算法，在保持结构信息的同时实现了高质量的音视频编辑效果。

Abstract: There is a high demand for audio-visual editing in video post-production and
the film making field. While numerous models have explored audio and video
editing, they struggle with object-level audio-visual operations. Specifically,
object-level audio-visual editing requires the ability to perform object
addition, replacement, and removal across both audio and visual modalities,
while preserving the structural information of the source instances during the
editing process. In this paper, we present \textbf{Object-AVEdit}, achieving
the object-level audio-visual editing based on the inversion-regeneration
paradigm. To achieve the object-level controllability during editing, we
develop a word-to-sounding-object well-aligned audio generation model, bridging
the gap in object-controllability between audio and current video generation
models. Meanwhile, to achieve the better structural information preservation
and object-level editing effect, we propose an inversion-regeneration
holistically-optimized editing algorithm, ensuring both information retention
during the inversion and better regeneration effect. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our editing model achieved advanced results in both
audio-video object-level editing tasks with fine audio-visual semantic
alignment. In addition, our developed audio generation model also achieved
advanced performance. More results on our project page:

Motivation: 解决形式化方法与实际开发实践之间的长期差距，通过图论建模强制执行结构正确性，为工业级软件开发提供可验证的方法论。

Method: 基于分层有向图的PBFD和PDFD方法，使用统一状态机和CSP进行形式化验证，提出TLE三层封装编码方案实现恒定时间更新。

Result: 8年企业部署验证：比Salesforce OmniScript开发速度快20倍以上，比传统关系模型查询性能快7-8倍。

Conclusion: PBFD和PDFD建立了可复现、透明的框架，将形式化验证融入实际软件开发，所有规范、MVP和数据集均已开源。

Abstract: This paper introduces Primary Breadth-First Development (PBFD) and Primary
Depth-First Development (PDFD), two formally defined and verified methodologies
for scalable, industrial-grade full-stack software engineering. These
approaches bridge a longstanding gap between formal methods and real-world
development practice by enforcing structural correctness through
graph-theoretic modeling. Unlike prior graph-based approaches, PBFD and PDFD
operate over layered directed graphs and are formalized using unified state
machines and Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) to ensure critical
properties, including bounded-refinement termination and structural
completeness. To coordinate hierarchical data at scale, we propose Three-Level
Encapsulation (TLE) - a novel, bitmask-based encoding scheme that delivers
provably constant-time updates. TLE's formal guarantees underpin PBFD's
industrial-scale performance and scalability. PBFD was empirically validated
through an eight-year enterprise deployment, demonstrating over 20x faster
development than Salesforce OmniScript and 7-8x faster query performance
compared to conventional relational models. Additionally, both methodologies
are supported by open-source MVPs, with PDFD's implementation conclusively
demonstrating its correctness-first design principles. Together, PBFD and PDFD
establish a reproducible, transparent framework that integrates formal
verification into practical software development. All formal specifications,
MVPs, and datasets are publicly available to foster academic research and
industrial-grade adoption.

Motivation: 随着可视化中显示数据量的增加，可视化本身可能变得难以理解。软件可视化工具通过视觉隐喻帮助程序理解，但当数据量大时面临视觉可扩展性挑战。

Method: 1. 语义缩放方法：根据虚拟相机与视觉对象的距离改变软件景观的图形表示

在ExplorViz工具中实现这些方法，这是一个基于Web的3D城市隐喻软件可视化工具

Conclusion: 语义缩放和迷你地图能有效解决3D软件城市可视化中的视觉可扩展性问题，但实现中仍存在一些需要改进的缺点，将在未来工作中解决。

Abstract: Software visualization tools can facilitate program comprehension by
providing visual metaphors, or abstractions that reduce the amount of textual
data that needs to be processed mentally. One way they do this is by enabling
developers to build an internal representation of the visualized software and
its architecture. However, as the amount of displayed data in the visualization
increases, the visualization itself can become more difficult to comprehend.
The ability to display small and large amounts of data in visualizations is
called visual scalability.
  In this paper, we present two approaches to address the challenge of visual
scalability in 3D software cities. First, we present an approach to semantic
zoom, in which the graphical representation of the software landscape changes
based on the virtual camera's distance from visual objects. Second, we augment
the visualization with a miniature two-dimensional top-view projection called
mini-map. We demonstrate our approach using an open-source implementation in
our software visualization tool ExplorViz. ExplorViz is web-based and uses the
3D city metaphor, focusing on live trace visualization.
  We evaluated our approaches in two separate user studies. The results
indicate that semantic zoom and the mini-map are both useful additions. User
feedback indicates that semantic zoom and mini-maps are especially useful for
large software landscapes and collaborative software exploration. The studies
indicate a good usability of our implemented approaches. However, some
shortcomings in our implementations have also been discovered, to be addressed
in future work.

Motivation: 大型软件系统通常提供Web界面，但现有软件可视化工具往往忽略这些界面。需要将Web界面集成到可视化工具中，以增强对软件行为的理解。

Method: 在基于Web的实时追踪软件可视化工具ExplorViz中添加嵌入式Web视图，通过三维表示展示HTML结构，特别是在同源上下文中可视化DOM。

Result: 通过初步用户研究评估可视化方法，获得了关于潜在用例、优势和不足的见解。

Conclusion: 基于研究结果提出了进一步研究方向，支持Web界面的可视化探索，并探索软件城市与HTML结构组合可视化的用例。

Abstract: Software visualization, which uses data from dynamic program analysis, can
help to explore and understand the behavior of software systems. It is common
that large software systems offer a web interface for user interaction.
Usually, available web interfaces are not regarded in software visualization
tools. This paper introduces additions to the web-based live tracing software
visualization tool ExplorViz: We add an embedded web view for instrumented
applications in the 3D visualization to ease interaction with the given
applications and enable the exploration of the thereby displayed HTML content.
Namely, the Document Object Model (DOM) is visualized via a three-dimensional
representation of the HTML structure in same-origin contexts.
  Our visualization approach is evaluated in a preliminary user study. The
study results give insights into the potential use cases, benefits, and
shortcomings of our implemented approach. Based on our study results, we
propose directions for further research to support the visual exploration of
web interfaces and explore use cases for the combined visualization of software
cities and HTML structure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够自动调优高性能计算程序的系统，通过多智能体协作提高代码生成质量和效率。

Method: 采用四角色多智能体配置（项目经理、系统工程师、程序员、持续交付），结合动态智能体部署和活动监控功能，实现迭代式提示优化。

Result: 在CPU到GPU代码转换案例中，多智能体配置相比单智能体在单位时间内生成更高质量的代码，并能更有效地识别需求违规和其他问题。

Conclusion: VibeCodeHPC的多智能体方法在HPC程序调优中表现出优越性，动态部署和监控功能增强了协作效果。

Abstract: We propose VibeCodeHPC, an automatic tuning system for HPC programs based on
multi-agent LLMs for code generation. VibeCodeHPC tunes programs through
multi-agent role allocation and iterative prompt refinement. We describe the
system configuration with four roles: Project Manager (PM), System Engineer
(SE), Programmer (PG), and Continuous Delivery (CD). We introduce dynamic agent
deployment and activity monitoring functions to facilitate effective
multi-agent collaboration. In our case study, we convert and optimize CPU-based
matrix-matrix multiplication code written in C to GPU code using CUDA. The
multi-agent configuration of VibeCodeHPC achieved higher-quality code
generation per unit time compared to a solo-agent configuration. Additionally,
the dynamic agent deployment and activity monitoring capabilities facilitated
more effective identification of requirement violations and other issues.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于Assurance 2.0范式的分解框架，通过结构化模板和三层次分解策略，为端到端AI自动驾驶车辆开发提供完整的安全论证和证据测量方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Assurance 2.0在置信度测量、残余怀疑管理、自动化支持以及实际处理反驳论点和确认偏差方面的局限性。

Method: 采用三层次分解策略：顶层将SDV开发分为需求工程、验证与确认、部署后三个阶段；每个阶段按产品开发生命周期进一步分解；使用改进的5M1E模型进行多维度分析。

Result: 开发了一个支持细粒度安全声明、证据和潜在反驳论点可追溯性的多维分解框架，并通过自动驾驶车辆案例研究进行了验证。

Conclusion: 该分解框架增强了安全论证的完整性、可追溯性和适应性，为复杂自适应系统的保证提供了更系统的方法。

Abstract: Assurance 2.0 is a modern framework developed to address the assurance
challenges of increasingly complex, adaptive, and autonomous systems. Building
on the traditional Claims-Argument-Evidence (CAE) model, it introduces reusable
assurance theories and explicit counterarguments (defeaters) to enhance rigor,
transparency, and adaptability. It supports continuous, incremental assurance,
enabling innovation without compromising safety. However, limitations persist
in confidence measurement, residual doubt management, automation support, and
the practical handling of defeaters and confirmation bias. This paper presents
\textcolor{black}{a set of decomposition frameworks to identify a complete set
of safety arguments and measure their corresponding evidence.} Grounded in the
Assurance 2.0 paradigm, the framework is instantiated through a structured
template and employs a three-tiered decomposition strategy. \textcolor{black}{A
case study regarding the application of the decomposition framework in the
end-to-end (E2E) AI-based Self-Driving Vehicle (SDV) development is also
presented in this paper.} At the top level, the SDV development is divided into
three critical phases: Requirements Engineering (RE), Verification and
Validation (VnV), and Post-Deployment (PD). Each phase is further decomposed
according to its Product Development Lifecycle (PDLC). To ensure comprehensive
coverage, each PDLC is analyzed using an adapted 5M1E model (Man, Machine,
Method, Material, Measurement, and Environment). Originally developed for
manufacturing quality control, the 5M1E model is reinterpreted and contextually
mapped to the assurance domain. This enables a multi-dimensional decomposition
that supports fine-grained traceability of safety claims, evidence, and
potential defeaters.

TL;DR: 论文提出了三种服务编排资源优化模式：抢占式调度、服务平衡和垃圾回收，以解决服务编排中的挑战并促进最佳实践采用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 服务编排对新手具有挑战性，现有资源缺乏清晰度和标准化，限制了最佳实践在软件行业中的采用。

Method: 分析现有文献和工具，识别常见的编排实践，定义三种资源优化模式。

Result: 定义了抢占式调度（为高优先级服务分配足够资源）、服务平衡（重构节点以优化资源使用）和垃圾回收（创建清理机制以优化系统资源使用）三种模式。

Conclusion: 这些模式作为改进编排实践和促进服务架构更广泛采用的基础要素。

Abstract: Service-based architectures provide substantial benefits, yet service
orchestration remains a challenge, particularly for newcomers. While various
resources on orchestration techniques exist, they often lack clarity and
standardization, making best practices difficult to implement and limiting
their adoption within the software industry.
  To address this gap, we analyzed existing literature and tools to identify
common orchestration practices. Based on our findings, we define three key
orchestration resource optimization patterns: {\sc Preemptive Scheduling}, {\sc
Service Balancing}, and {\sc Garbage Collection}. {\sc Preemptive Scheduling}
allows the allocation of sufficient resources for services of higher priority
in stressful situations, while {\sc Service Balancing} enables a restructuring
of the nodes to allow better resource usage. To end, {\sc Garbage Collection}
creates cleanup mechanisms to better understand the system's resource usage and
optimize it. These patterns serve as foundational elements for improving
orchestration practices and fostering broader adoption in service-based
architectures.

### [222] [Which Programming Language and Model Work Best With LLM-as-a-Judge For Code Retrieval?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00324)
*Lucas Roberts,Denisa Roberts*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文研究使用大型语言模型(LLMs)进行代码搜索和标注生成，比较了不同检索器表示(稀疏vs语义)、编程语言和LLM对代码搜索的影响，发现检索器和编程语言存在亲和性，并提出使用转译器来扩展代码搜索基准数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码搜索是重要的信息检索应用，但代码标注需要编程语言和软件工程专业知识，人工标注成本高昂。本文旨在利用LLMs解决代码搜索中的标注挑战。

Method: 比较稀疏和语义检索器表示，在多种编程语言(C、Java、Javascript、Go、Python)上测试，使用LLMs作为评判模型评估编程语言亲和性，并提出使用转译器扩展基准数据集。

Result: 发现检索器和编程语言存在亲和性，可改善人类和AI相关性判断的一致性；不同编程语言在表示方法上存在差异；人类-AI一致性率与人类间一致性率相当。

Conclusion: LLMs可用于改进代码搜索，检索器和编程语言的选择对性能有重要影响，转译器是扩展代码搜索基准数据集的有效方法。

Abstract: Code search is an important information retrieval application. Benefits of
better code search include faster new developer on-boarding, reduced software
maintenance, and ease of understanding for large repositories. Despite
improvements in search algorithms and search benchmarks, the domain of code
search has lagged behind. One reason is the high cost of human annotation for
code queries and answers. While humans may annotate search results in general
text QA systems, code annotations require specialized knowledge of a
programming language (PL), as well as domain specific software engineering
knowledge. In this work we study the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
retrieve code at the level of functions and to generate annotations for code
search results. We compare the impact of the retriever representation (sparse
vs. semantic), programming language, and LLM by comparing human annotations
across several popular languages (C, Java, Javascript, Go, and Python). We
focus on repositories that implement common data structures likely to be
implemented in any PLs. For the same human annotations, we compare several
LLM-as-a-Judge models to evaluate programming language and other affinities
between LLMs. We find that the chosen retriever and PL exhibit affinities that
can be leveraged to improve alignment of human and AI relevance determinations,
with significant performance implications. We also find differences in
representation (sparse vs. semantic) across PLs that impact alignment of human
and AI relevance determinations. We propose using transpilers to bootstrap
scalable code search benchmark datasets in other PLs and in a case study
demonstrate that human-AI relevance agreement rates largely match the (worst
case) human-human agreement under study. The application code used in this work
is available at \href{https://github.com/rlucas7/code-searcher/}{this github

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文系统研究了"氛围编码"现象，即用户依赖AI代码生成工具通过直觉和试错编写代码，揭示了速度与质量的权衡悖论，并指出这会创造新的易受攻击的开发者群体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI代码生成工具被广泛采用，但尚无研究系统调查用户为何进行氛围编码、他们在过程中的体验以及如何进行质量保证。

Method: 通过对101个从业者来源进行系统灰色文献回顾，提取了518个关于氛围编码实践、挑战和局限的第一手行为描述。

Result: 分析揭示了速度-质量权衡悖论：氛围编码者被速度和可访问性驱动，常体验到"即时成功和流畅感"，但大多数人认为生成的代码快速但有缺陷。质量保证实践经常被忽视。

Conclusion: 氛围编码降低了门槛并加速了原型设计，但以可靠性和可维护性为代价。这些见解对工具设计者和软件开发团队具有重要意义，需要引导其负责任使用以防止AI辅助开发中的质量保证危机。

Abstract: AI code generation tools are transforming software development, especially
for novice and non-software developers, by enabling them to write code and
build applications faster and with little to no human intervention. Vibe coding
is the practice where users rely on AI code generation tools through intuition
and trial-and-error without necessarily understanding the underlying code.
Despite widespread adoption, no research has systematically investigated why
users engage in vibe coding, what they experience while doing so, and how they
approach quality assurance (QA) and perceive the quality of the AI-generated
code. To this end, we conduct a systematic grey literature review of 101
practitioner sources, extracting 518 firsthand behavioral accounts about vibe
coding practices, challenges, and limitations. Our analysis reveals a
speed-quality trade-off paradox, where vibe coders are motivated by speed and
accessibility, often experiencing rapid ``instant success and flow'', yet most
perceive the resulting code as fast but flawed. QA practices are frequently
overlooked, with many skipping testing, relying on the models' or tools'
outputs without modification, or delegating checks back to the AI code
generation tools. This creates a new class of vulnerable software developers,
particularly those who build a product but are unable to debug it when issues
arise. We argue that vibe coding lowers barriers and accelerates prototyping,
but at the cost of reliability and maintainability. These insights carry
implications for tool designers and software development teams. Understanding
how vibe coding is practiced today is crucial for guiding its responsible use
and preventing a broader QA crisis in AI-assisted development.

TL;DR: 基于学习的测试（LBT）通过结合学习和测试过程，利用主动学习推断被测系统模型，仅需少量初始测试用例即可实现大规模复杂程序的可扩展测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LBT旨在解决传统测试方法在大规模和复杂程序测试中的局限性，通过融合学习和测试过程实现行为充分性和测试充分性。

Method: 采用主动学习技术逐步生成测试用例，通过系统文献综述分析不同程序类型下的LBT实现，评估理论框架、工具库和工业应用案例。

Result: LBT在过程式和反应式程序测试中展现出良好效果，工业案例证明了其在商业软件测试中的潜力和有效性。

Conclusion: LBT作为软件测试领域有前景的技术，具有未充分利用的潜力，可为实践者和研究社区带来显著益处。

Abstract: Learning-Based Testing (LBT) merges learning and testing processes to achieve
both testing and behavioral adequacy. LBT utilizes active learning to infer the
model of the System Under Test (SUT), enabling scalability for large and
complex programs by requiring only a minimal set of initial test cases. The
core principle of LBT is that the SUT's behavior can be thoroughly inferred by
progressively generating test cases and subjecting the SUT to testing, thereby
ensuring comprehensive testing. Despite being in its early stages, LBT has a
solid foundation of theoretical research demonstrating its efficacy in testing
both procedural and reactive programs. This paper provides a systematic
literature review of various LBT implementations across different program types
and evaluates the current state of research in this field. We explore diverse
theoretical frameworks, existing tools, and libraries within the LBT domain to
illustrate the concept's evolution and current research status. Additionally,
we examine case studies involving the application of LBT tools in industrial
settings, highlighting their potential and effectiveness in commercial software
testing. This systematic literature review aims to offer researchers a
comprehensive perspective on the inception and development of LBT, presenting
it as a promising technique in software testing. By unveiling LBT's
underutilized potential, this paper seeks to significantly benefit the
practitioners and research community.

TL;DR: 提出了Code Concept Analysis (CoCoA)框架，通过聚类上下文token嵌入来揭示代码语言模型表示空间中的词汇、句法和语义结构，提高模型可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型代码语言模型内部行为解释的挑战，特别是在需要信任、透明度和语义鲁棒性的应用中。

Method: 使用混合标注流程结合静态分析工具和提示工程LLM，将上下文token嵌入聚类为人类可解释的概念组，并与局部归因方法集成。

Result: CoCoA发现的概念在语义保留扰动下保持稳定（平均CSI=0.288），在用户研究中概念增强解释将人类中心可解释性提高了37个百分点。

Conclusion: CoCoA框架能有效揭示代码语言模型的潜在概念结构，提供更连贯和可解释的token级显著性解释，改善模型透明度。

Abstract: Interpreting the internal behavior of large language models trained on code
remains a critical challenge, particularly for applications demanding trust,
transparency, and semantic robustness. We propose Code Concept Analysis
(CoCoA): a global post-hoc interpretability framework that uncovers emergent
lexical, syntactic, and semantic structures in a code language model's
representation space by clustering contextualized token embeddings into
human-interpretable concept groups. We propose a hybrid annotation pipeline
that combines static analysis tool-based syntactic alignment with
prompt-engineered large language models (LLMs), enabling scalable labeling of
latent concepts across abstraction levels. We analyse the distribution of
concepts across layers and across three finetuning tasks. Emergent concept
clusters can help identify unexpected latent interactions and be used to
identify trends and biases within the model's learned representations. We
further integrate LCA with local attribution methods to produce
concept-grounded explanations, improving the coherence and interpretability of
token-level saliency. Empirical evaluations across multiple models and tasks
show that LCA discovers concepts that remain stable under semantic-preserving
perturbations (average Cluster Sensitivity Index, CSI = 0.288) and evolve
predictably with fine-tuning. In a user study, concept-augmented explanations
disambiguate token roles. In a user study on the programming-language
classification task, concept-augmented explanations disambiguated token roles
and improved human-centric explainability by 37 percentage points compared with
token-level attributions using Integrated Gradients.

TL;DR: CodeChemist是一个无需重新训练模型的高效测试时扩展框架，通过从高资源编程语言向低资源语言进行功能知识迁移，提升代码生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码大语言模型在不同编程语言上的性能不一致，低资源语言由于训练数据有限而表现较差，需要一种方法来改善这种情况。

Method: 首先生成并执行高资源语言的代码来创建包含功能知识的测试用例，然后使用多温度对冲采样生成低资源语言的代码片段，根据测试用例通过率选择最佳代码。

Result: 广泛实验表明，CodeChemist优于现有的测试时扩展方法，显著提升了低资源编程语言的代码生成性能。

Conclusion: CodeChemist框架能够有效实现跨编程语言的功能知识迁移，在不重新训练模型的情况下提升低资源语言的代码生成能力。

Abstract: Code Large Language Models (CodeLLMs) are increasingly used in code
generation tasks across a wide range of applications. However, their
performance is often inconsistent across different programming languages (PLs),
with low-resource PLs suffering the most due to limited training data. In this
paper, we present CodeChemist, a novel and efficient framework for test-time
scaling that enables functional knowledge transfer from high-resource to
low-resource PLs using generated test cases. CodeChemist first generates and
executes code in high-resource PLs to create test cases that encapsulate
functional knowledge. It then uses multi-temperature hedged sampling to
generate code snippets in the low-resource PL and selects the best one based on
the pass rate of the test cases. Our extensive experiments show that
CodeChemist outperforms existing test-time scaling approaches, boosting the
performance of code generation for low-resource PLs without requiring any model
retraining.

TL;DR: LSPFuzz是一个针对语言服务器协议(LSP)服务器的灰盒混合模糊测试工具，通过两阶段变异管道系统性地测试LSP服务器可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LSP服务器可靠性问题日益严重，崩溃会禁用所有代码智能功能，漏洞可能让开发者面临风险，但目前没有专门针对LSP服务器测试的技术。

Method: 采用两阶段变异管道：语法感知的源代码变异，然后上下文感知的编辑器操作分发，以有效探索输入空间并满足LSP的复杂约束。

Result: 在四个广泛使用的LSP服务器上评估，LSPFuzz表现优于基线模糊器，发现了51个先前未知的bug，其中42个被确认，26个已修复，2个获得CVE编号。

Conclusion: LSPFuzz推进了LSP服务器的质量保证，为未来该领域研究提供了实用工具和基础见解。

Abstract: The Language Server Protocol (LSP) has revolutionized the integration of code
intelligence in modern software development. There are approximately 300 LSP
server implementations for various languages and 50 editors offering LSP
integration. However, the reliability of LSP servers is a growing concern, as
crashes can disable all code intelligence features and significantly impact
productivity, while vulnerabilities can put developers at risk even when
editing untrusted source code. Despite the widespread adoption of LSP, no
existing techniques specifically target LSP server testing. To bridge this gap,
we present LSPFuzz, a grey-box hybrid fuzzer for systematic LSP server testing.
Our key insight is that effective LSP server testing requires holistic mutation
of source code and editor operations, as bugs often manifest from their
combinations. To satisfy the sophisticated constraints of LSP and effectively
explore the input space, we employ a two-stage mutation pipeline: syntax-aware
mutations to source code, followed by context-aware dispatching of editor
operations. We evaluated LSPFuzz on four widely used LSP servers. LSPFuzz
demonstrated superior performance compared to baseline fuzzers, and uncovered
previously unknown bugs in real-world LSP servers. Of the 51 bugs we reported,
42 have been confirmed, 26 have been fixed by developers, and two have been
assigned CVE numbers. Our work advances the quality assurance of LSP servers,
providing both a practical tool and foundational insights for future research
in this domain.

Conclusion: AI驱动的自我进化软件展示了实现真正自动化软件开发的潜力，为未来软件工程的发展指明了新方向。

Abstract: Software automation has long been a central goal of software engineering,
striving for software development that proceeds without human intervention.
Recent efforts have leveraged Artificial Intelligence (AI) to advance software
automation with notable progress. However, current AI functions primarily as
assistants to human developers, leaving software development still dependent on
explicit human intervention. This raises a fundamental question: Can AI move
beyond its role as an assistant to become a core component of software, thereby
enabling genuine software automation? To investigate this vision, we introduce
AI-Driven Self-Evolving Software, a new form of software that evolves
continuously through direct interaction with users. We demonstrate the
feasibility of this idea with a lightweight prototype built on a multi-agent
architecture that autonomously interprets user requirements, generates and
validates code, and integrates new functionalities. Case studies across
multiple representative scenarios show that the prototype can reliably
construct and reuse functionality, providing early evidence that such software
systems can scale to more sophisticated applications and pave the way toward
truly automated software development. We make code and cases in this work
publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/live-software.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Python项目中的依赖膨胀问题增加了维护成本和安全风险，现有工具只能检测未使用依赖但无法自动移除，需要人工操作。

Method: PYTRIM采用模块化设计，可与任何依赖检测工具集成，并包含新颖的动态分析组件来提高依赖检测的召回率。

Result: 在37个真实合并请求的数据集上，PYTRIM实现了98.3%的准确率。在971个开源包中，成功识别并修剪了39个包的膨胀依赖，其中6个已被接受合并。

Conclusion: PYTRIM能有效自动化移除Python项目中的未使用依赖，提高维护效率，并已作为开源项目发布。

Abstract: Dependency bloat is a persistent challenge in Python projects, which
increases maintenance costs and security risks. While numerous tools exist for
detecting unused dependencies in Python, removing these dependencies across the
source code and configuration files of a project requires manual effort and
expertise.
  To tackle this challenge we introduce PYTRIM, an end-to-end system to
automate this process. PYTRIM eliminates unused imports and package
declarations across a variety of file types, including Python source and
configuration files such as requirements.txt and setup.py. PYTRIM's modular
design makes it agnostic to the source of dependency bloat information,
enabling integration with any detection tool. Beyond its contribution when it
comes to automation, PYTRIM also incorporates a novel dynamic analysis
component that improves dependency detection recall.
  Our evaluation of PYTRIM's end-to-end effectiveness on a ground-truth dataset
of 37 merged pull requests from prior work, shows that PYTRIM achieves 98.3%
accuracy in replicating human-made changes. To show its practical impact, we
run PYTRIM on 971 open-source packages, identifying and trimming bloated
dependencies in 39 of them. For each case, we submit a corresponding pull
request, 6 of which have already been accepted and merged. PYTRIM is available
as an open-source project, encouraging community contributions and further
development.

Motivation: 现有方法难以检测表现为复杂形状偏差的shapelet异常，这些异常对人类专家来说很明显，但对机器学习算法具有挑战性。

Method: 引入补丁式双重注意力机制与多尺度卷积，通过平衡局部细粒度形状特征与全局上下文依赖来建模复杂的子序列变化。

Result: 在五个多样化基准测试中，TShape优于现有最先进模型，异常检测平均F1分数提高10%。消融研究和注意力可视化证实了各组件的重要贡献。

Conclusion: TShape对时间序列数据中复杂形状的shapelet异常具有鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is critical for maintaining the
reliability of modern IT infrastructures, where complex anomalies frequently
arise in highly dynamic environments. In this paper, we present TShape, a novel
framework designed to address the challenges in industrial time series anomaly
detection. Existing methods often struggle to detect shapelet anomalies that
manifest as complex shape deviations, which appear obvious to human experts but
prove challenging for machine learning algorithms. TShape introduces a
patch-wise dual attention mechanism with multi-scale convolution to model
intricate sub-sequence variations by balancing local, fine-grained shape
features with global contextual dependencies. Our extensive evaluation on five
diverse benchmarks demonstrates that TShape outperforms existing
state-of-the-art models, achieving an average 10\% F1 score improvement in
anomaly detection. Additionally, ablation studies and attention visualizations
confirm the essential contributions of each component, highlighting the
robustness and adaptability of TShape to complex shapelet shapes in time series
data.

Motivation: 现代软件项目依赖大量第三方库，使得可重现和安全构建变得复杂。Maven作为Java生态系统最重要的包管理器之一，缺乏原生锁文件支持，无法确保依赖版本固定和完整性验证。

Method: 开发了Maven-Lockfile工具来生成和更新锁文件，支持从历史版本重建项目。锁文件捕获所有直接和传递依赖及其校验和，实现高完整性构建。

Result: 评估显示Maven-Lockfile能够重现历史提交的构建，并能检测被篡改的构件。通过最小配置即可为Java项目提供现代构建完整性和可重现性。

Conclusion: Maven-Lockfile为Java项目提供了现代构建完整性和可重现性支持，并为Java软件供应链安全研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Modern software projects depend on many third-party libraries, complicating
reproducible and secure builds. Several package managers address this with the
generation of a lockfile that freezes dependency versions and can be used to
verify the integrity of dependencies. Yet, Maven, one of the most important
package managers in the Java ecosystem, lacks native support for a lockfile. We
present Maven-Lockfile to generate and update lockfiles, with support for
rebuilding projects from past versions. Our lockfiles capture all direct and
transitive dependencies with their checksums, enabling high integrity builds.
Our evaluation shows that Maven-Lockfile can reproduce builds from historical
commits and is able to detect tampered artifacts. With minimal configuration,
Maven-Lockfile equips Java projects with modern build integrity and build
reproducibility, and fosters future research on software supply chain security
in Java.

*Rudrajit Choudhuri,Carmen Badea,Christian Bird,Jenna Butler,Rob DeLine,Brian Houck*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该研究通过大规模混合方法调查了860名开发者，揭示了任务评估如何预测AI采用模式，提供了首个基于任务感知的AI采用模式映射和负责任AI优先级指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI正在重塑软件工作，但缺乏关于开发者最需要AI支持的地方以及如何负责任设计的明确指导。

Method: 采用认知评价理论和混合方法，对860名开发者进行调查，分析他们在何处、为何以及如何寻求或限制AI帮助。

Result: 研究发现：核心工作（编码、测试）有强烈使用需求；减少繁琐工作（文档、运维）需求高；身份和关系相关工作（指导）有明显限制。负责任AI优先级因任务而异。

Conclusion: 研究结果为在开发者真正需要的地方提供AI支持提供了具体、情境化的指导，帮助负责任地设计AI工具。

Abstract: Generative AI is reshaping software work, yet we lack clear guidance on where
developers most need and want support, and how to design it responsibly. We
report a large-scale, mixed-methods study of N=860 developers that examines
where, why, and how they seek or limit AI help, providing the first task-aware,
empirically validated mapping from developers' perceptions of their tasks to AI
adoption patterns and responsible AI priorities. Using cognitive appraisal
theory, we show that task evaluations predict openness to and use of AI,
revealing distinct patterns: strong current use and a desire for improvement in
core work (e.g., coding, testing); high demand to reduce toil (e.g.,
documentation, operations); and clear limits for identity- and
relationship-centric work (e.g., mentoring). Priorities for responsible AI
support vary by context: reliability and security for systems-facing tasks;
transparency, alignment, and steerability to maintain control; and fairness and
inclusiveness for human-facing work. Our results offer concrete, contextual
guidance for delivering AI where it matters to developers and their work.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个自动化框架，用于评估16个大型语言模型在零样本设置下的伦理推理能力，使用30个真实世界伦理场景。结果显示LLMs在伦理理论一致性方面达到73.3%，道德可接受性方面达到86.7%的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs越来越多地集成到软件工程工具中，用于处理超出代码合成的任务，包括在不确定性下的判断和伦理重要情境中的推理，需要评估其伦理推理能力。

Method: 使用30个真实世界伦理场景，在零样本设置下评估16个LLMs。每个模型被提示识别最适用的伦理理论、评估道德可接受性，并解释其选择背后的推理。将响应与专家伦理学家的选择进行比较。

Result: LLMs在伦理理论一致性方面平均达到73.3%，在道德可接受性方面达到86.7%的一致性。可解释的分歧主要集中在伦理模糊案例中。自由文本解释的定性分析显示，尽管表面词汇多样性，但模型间存在强烈的概念收敛。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持LLMs作为SE管道中伦理推理引擎的潜在可行性，可实现可扩展、可审计和自适应的用户对齐伦理推理集成。当前LLMs表现出足够的解释稳定性和理论一致性推理来支持自动化分析。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into software
engineering (SE) tools for tasks that extend beyond code synthesis, including
judgment under uncertainty and reasoning in ethically significant contexts. We
present a fully automated framework for assessing ethical reasoning
capabilities across 16 LLMs in a zero-shot setting, using 30 real-world
ethically charged scenarios. Each model is prompted to identify the most
applicable ethical theory to an action, assess its moral acceptability, and
explain the reasoning behind their choice. Responses are compared against
expert ethicists' choices using inter-model agreement metrics. Our results show
that LLMs achieve an average Theory Consistency Rate (TCR) of 73.3% and Binary
Agreement Rate (BAR) on moral acceptability of 86.7%, with interpretable
divergences concentrated in ethically ambiguous cases. A qualitative analysis
of free-text explanations reveals strong conceptual convergence across models
despite surface-level lexical diversity. These findings support the potential
viability of LLMs as ethical inference engines within SE pipelines, enabling
scalable, auditable, and adaptive integration of user-aligned ethical
reasoning. Our focus is the Ethical Interpreter component of a broader
profiling pipeline: we evaluate whether current LLMs exhibit sufficient
interpretive stability and theory-consistent reasoning to support automated
profiling.

*Songqiang Chen,Congying Xu,Jingyi Chen,Jialun Cao,Jiarong Wu,Shing-Chi Cheung*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出基于伪代码的代码翻译方法，通过先将程序转换为伪代码再翻译到目标语言，相比直接翻译能更好地处理复杂程序，特别是在从灵活语言到严格语言的翻译和低资源Rust翻译中表现更佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接代码翻译方法在处理复杂程序时存在困难，受人类语义翻译启发，探索通过伪代码作为中间步骤来提升大语言模型在代码翻译中的准确性。

Method: 采用基于伪代码的代码翻译方法，先将程序意图和逻辑转换为伪代码，再实现到目标编程语言。在9,690个翻译任务上比较直接翻译和伪代码翻译方法，涉及6种编程语言和5个主流大语言模型。

Result: 伪代码翻译能有效补充直接翻译，特别是在从灵活语言到严格语言的翻译和低资源Rust翻译中表现更好。伪代码翻译有助于解耦复杂程序的翻译过程，减少原始程序实现细节的干扰。

Conclusion: 建议结合两种方法的互补优势来提升代码翻译准确性。伪代码翻译的主要局限在于伪代码可能不正确、不完整或存在歧义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show great potential in code translation.
However, accurate translation remains challenging when using the commonly
adopted direct code-to-code translation approach, which converts a program into
the target programming language (PL) in a single step. Inspired by the success
of incorporating intermediate steps to guide LLMs in resolving challenging
tasks, we explore pseudocode-based code translation, which emulates the human
semantic translation by first interpreting the program's intent and logic into
pseudocode and then implementing it in the target PL. We find that
pseudocode-based translation helps translate programs that direct translation
struggles to handle. Nonetheless, the effectiveness, advantages, and
limitations of this approach remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, we
present an empirical study on pseudocode-based code translation, aiming to
investigate its effectiveness in enhancing the direct translation approach,
illuminate its effective usage, and identify limitations hindering its
potential benefits. By comparing direct and pseudocode-based translation
approaches on 9,690 translation tasks across six PLs with five popular LLMs, we
demonstrate that pseudocode-based translation can effectively complement direct
translation, particularly when translating from flexible to rigid PLs or
dealing with low-resource Rust. Based on these findings, we suggest adopting
strategies that combine the complementary strengths of both approaches to
enhance code translation accuracy. We also reveal the advantages of
pseudocode-based translation in disentangling translations of complicated
programs and mitigating distractions from detailed implementations in original
programs, as well as its limitations due to incorrect, incomplete, or ambiguous
pseudocode.

*Shiza Andleeb,Brandon Kantorski,Jeffrey C. Carver*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ChatGPT在编程课程中能提高代码质量和效率，但对概念理解的影响不一致，需要结构化整合来培养独立解决问题的能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ChatGPT在编程入门课程中对代码质量、概念理解、任务完成时间和学生认知的影响，以了解AI工具在教育中的利弊

Method: 采用平衡设计的准实验研究，学生在C语言编程作业中交替使用ChatGPT和非ChatGPT条件，通过多维评分标准、概念后测调查和任务完成时间进行评估

Result: 使用ChatGPT的学生代码质量评分显著更高，任务完成时间更短；概念理解结果不一，函数主题较低但结构主题较高；学生对ChatGPT体验积极，但担忧准确性和长期技能发展

Conclusion: ChatGPT能提升新手程序员的代码质量和效率，但未必能统一改善概念理解，建议结构化整合和补充教学策略来培养独立问题解决能力

Abstract: Background: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are increasingly
used in introductory programming courses to provide real-time code generation,
debugging, and explanations. While these tools can boost productivity and code
quality, concerns remain about over-reliance and potential impacts on
conceptual learning. Objective: To investigate how ChatGPT access affects code
quality, conceptual understanding, task completion times, and student
perceptions in a CS1 course. Methods: We conducted a counterbalanced,
quasi-experimental study in which students alternated between ChatGPT and
non-ChatGPT conditions across two programming assignments in C (functions and
structures). We evaluated their code submissions using multidimensional
rubrics, conceptual post-surveys, and task completion time. Results: Students
who had access to ChatGPT produced significantly higher rubric scores for code
quality and completed tasks in less time compared to those without access.
However, gains in conceptual understanding were mixed, lower for the functions
topic but higher for the structures topic. Students reported positive
experiences with ChatGPT, citing its value for debugging and practice, while
expressing concerns about accuracy and long-term skill development.
Conclusions: ChatGPT can enhance code quality and efficiency for novice
programmers, but may not uniformly improve conceptual understanding. Structured
integration and complementary instructional strategies are recommended to
foster independent problem-solving skills.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解学生在软件测试中哪些概念最常被误解，以及这些误解如何影响测试套件的改进效果。

Method: 通过分析高年级软件测试课程中学生的作业提交，使用自动化反馈工具识别概念差距和无成效修改模式。

Result: 决策覆盖和异常处理是持续存在的挑战，学生通常进行表面或方法级别的修改，无法提升代码覆盖率。

Conclusion: 研究结果为教育者、研究人员和工具设计者提供了可操作的见解，可帮助改进反馈系统、针对性教学，更好地支持学生开发健壮的测试套件。

Abstract: Effective software testing is critical for producing reliable and secure
software, yet many computer science students struggle to master the
foundational concepts required to construct comprehensive test suites. While
automated feedback tools are widely used to support student learning, it
remains unclear which testing concepts are most frequently misunderstood and
how these misunderstandings are reflected in students' test suite revisions.
This study examines the specific testing concepts that lead students to make
ineffective changes, those that fail to improve code coverage, during test
suite development. Leveraging an automated feedback tool in a senior-level
software testing course, we analyzed student submissions from two assignments
to identify prevalent conceptual gaps and patterns of unproductive
modification. Our results reveal that decision coverage and exception handling
are persistent challenges, and that students most often make superficial or
method-level changes that do not enhance coverage. These findings provide
actionable insights for educators, researchers, and tool designers. By
pinpointing the concepts that most often contribute to poor testing outcomes,
we can refine feedback systems, target instruction to address persistent
misconceptions, and more effectively support students in developing robust,
maintainable test suites.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SeCuRepair是一个基于语义对齐、课程驱动和推理增强的漏洞修复框架，通过"先推理后编辑"范式和语义感知强化学习，显著提升了自动漏洞修复的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于学习的自动漏洞修复方法在真实场景中泛化能力不足，存在跨仓库泛化能力有限、无法捕捉长距离依赖、过度依赖表面词汇模式等三个根本性弱点。

Method: 采用"先推理后编辑"范式，要求模型在生成补丁前明确表达修复逻辑；使用语义感知强化学习，奖励补丁与目标补丁的语法和语义对齐；结合难度感知课程学习，从简单修复逐步过渡到复杂的多块协调编辑。

Result: 在BigVul和PrimeVul_AVR数据集上，SeCuRepair显著优于所有基线方法，在CodeBLEU指标上分别比最佳基线高出34.52%和31.52%。消融研究证实了框架各组件对最终性能的贡献。

Conclusion: SeCuRepair通过语义对齐、课程驱动和推理增强的方法，有效解决了现有自动漏洞修复方法的泛化问题，为实际应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Current learning-based Automated Vulnerability Repair (AVR) approaches, while
promising, often fail to generalize effectively in real-world scenarios. Our
diagnostic analysis reveals three fundamental weaknesses in state-of-the-art
AVR approaches: (1) limited cross-repository generalization, with performance
drops on unseen codebases; (2) inability to capture long-range dependencies,
causing a performance degradation on complex, multi-hunk repairs; and (3)
over-reliance on superficial lexical patterns, leading to significant
performance drops on vulnerabilities with minor syntactic variations like
variable renaming.
  To address these limitations, we propose SeCuRepair, a semantics-aligned,
curriculum-driven, and reasoning-enhanced framework for vulnerability repair.
At its core, SeCuRepair adopts a reason-then-edit paradigm, requiring the model
to articulate why and how a vulnerability should be fixed before generating the
patch. This explicit reasoning enforces a genuine understanding of repair logic
rather than superficial memorization of lexical patterns. SeCuRepair also moves
beyond traditional supervised fine-tuning and employs semantics-aware
reinforcement learning, rewarding patches for their syntactic and semantic
alignment with the oracle patch rather than mere token overlap. Complementing
this, a difficulty-aware curriculum progressively trains the model, starting
with simple fixes and advancing to complex, multi-hunk coordinated edits.
  We evaluate SeCuRepair on strict, repository-level splits of BigVul and newly
crafted PrimeVul_AVR datasets. SeCuRepair significantly outperforms all
baselines, surpassing the best-performing baselines by 34.52% on BigVul and
31.52% on PrimeVul\textsubscript{AVR} in terms of CodeBLEU, respectively.
Comprehensive ablation studies further confirm that each component of our
framework contributes to its final performance.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出通过利用代码库的提交历史来增强语言代理的长期记忆能力，以改进代码定位任务，特别是在bug修复等仓库级软件工程任务中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理代码库时通常假设没有先验知识，每次都是从零开始处理，而人类开发者会积累长期代码库记忆。提交历史作为记录代码库演变的丰富资源被低估了。

Method: 引入工具使代理能够从非参数化记忆中检索：包括近期历史提交和关联问题，以及通过提交模式识别的活跃代码部分的功能摘要。

Result: 实验表明，增强这种记忆能力能显著提升最先进的定位框架LocAgent在SWE-bench-verified和SWE-bench-live基准测试上的性能。

Conclusion: 这项研究有助于开发能够积累和利用过去经验处理长期任务的智能代理，更接近模拟人类开发者的专业能力。

Abstract: Code localization is a fundamental challenge in repository-level software
engineering tasks such as bug fixing. While existing methods equip language
agents with comprehensive tools/interfaces to fetch information from the
repository, they overlook the critical aspect of memory, where each instance is
typically handled from scratch assuming no prior repository knowledge. In
contrast, human developers naturally build long-term repository memory, such as
the functionality of key modules and associations between various bug types and
their likely fix locations. In this work, we augment language agents with such
memory by leveraging a repository's commit history - a rich yet underutilized
resource that chronicles the codebase's evolution. We introduce tools that
allow the agent to retrieve from a non-parametric memory encompassing recent
historical commits and linked issues, as well as functionality summaries of
actively evolving parts of the codebase identified via commit patterns. We
demonstrate that augmenting such a memory can significantly improve LocAgent, a
state-of-the-art localization framework, on both SWE-bench-verified and the
more recent SWE-bench-live benchmarks. Our research contributes towards
developing agents that can accumulate and leverage past experience for
long-horizon tasks, more closely emulating the expertise of human developers.

TL;DR: GenIA-E2ETest利用生成式AI从自然语言描述自动生成可执行的端到端测试脚本，在Web应用中评估显示77%的元素指标、82%的执行精度、85%的执行召回率，仅需10%的手动调整，证明是实用有效的自动化测试解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统软件测试耗时且易错，现有基于大语言模型的自动化测试方案主要关注单元测试，未能解决端到端测试的挑战，需要验证从用户输入到系统响应的完整应用工作流。

Method: 提出GenIA-E2ETest方法，利用生成式AI从自然语言描述自动生成可执行的端到端测试脚本。

Result: 在两个Web应用上评估显示：元素指标平均77%，执行精度82%，执行召回率85%，手动修改率仅10%，在典型Web场景中表现一致。

Conclusion: 尽管对上下文相关导航和动态内容存在一定敏感性，但GenIA-E2ETest是从自然语言加速端到端测试自动化的实用有效解决方案，能减少人工工作量并扩大自动化测试的访问范围。

Abstract: Software testing is essential to ensure system quality, but it remains
time-consuming and error-prone when performed manually. Although recent
advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled automated test
generation, most existing solutions focus on unit testing and do not address
the challenges of end-to-end (E2E) testing, which validates complete
application workflows from user input to final system response. This paper
introduces GenIA-E2ETest, which leverages generative AI to generate executable
E2E test scripts from natural language descriptions automatically. We evaluated
the approach on two web applications, assessing completeness, correctness,
adaptation effort, and robustness. Results were encouraging: the scripts
achieved an average of 77% for both element metrics, 82% for precision of
execution, 85% for execution recall, required minimal manual adjustments
(average manual modification rate of 10%), and showed consistent performance in
typical web scenarios. Although some sensitivity to context-dependent
navigation and dynamic content was observed, the findings suggest that
GenIA-E2ETest is a practical and effective solution to accelerate E2E test
automation from natural language, reducing manual effort and broadening access
to automated testing.

Motivation: 解决LLMs生成代码缺乏可信度和可能违反版权或许可证的问题，因为缺少代码来源信息。

Method: 结合LLMs的网络搜索功能检索候选链接，然后对生成代码和检索代码进行相似性分析。

Result: 初步结果显示CodeGenLink能有效通过相似性分析过滤无关链接，并在可用时提供许可证信息。

Conclusion: CodeGenLink为开发者提供了识别代码来源和许可证信息的能力，增强了LLMs生成代码的可信度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in software development tasks
nowadays. Unlike reusing code taken from the Web, for LLMs' generated code,
developers are concerned about its lack of trustworthiness and possible
copyright or licensing violations, due to the lack of code provenance
information. This paper proposes CodeGenLink, a GitHub CoPilot extension for
Visual Studio Code aimed at (i) suggesting links containing code very similar
to automatically generated code, and (ii) whenever possible, indicating the
license of the likely origin of the code. CodeGenLink retrieves candidate links
by combining LLMs with their web search features and then performs similarity
analysis between the generated and retrieved code. Preliminary results show
that CodeGenLink effectively filters unrelated links via similarity analysis
and provides licensing information when available. Tool URL:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源组件在现代软件中广泛使用，许可证不合规可能带来财务、法律和声誉风险，需要了解开发者如何应对许可证合规任务。

Method: 由软件工程和法律研究人员组成的联合团队进行了包含58名开发者的调查和7个后续访谈的研究。

Result: 研究得出了关于当前实践状况的15个关键发现。

Conclusion: 讨论了研究发现的影响，并为未来的研究和许可证工具提供了可操作的建议。

Abstract: Most modern software products incorporate open-source components, requiring
development teams to maintain compliance with each component's licenses.
Noncompliance can lead to significant financial, legal, and reputational
repercussions. While some organizations may seek advice from legal
practitioners to assist with licensing tasks, developers still play a key role
in such a process. To this end, it is essential to understand how developers
approach license compliance tasks, the challenges they encounter, and the tools
that they use. This work studies these aspects of software licensing practices
through a study - conducted by a joint team of software engineering and legal
researchers - consisting of a survey with 58 software developers and seven
follow-up interviews. The study resulted in 15 key findings regarding the
current state of practice. We discuss the implications of our findings and
offer directions for future research as well as actionable recommendations for
licensing tools.

TL;DR: 对多用户XR系统软件缺陷的首个大规模实证研究，分析了2,649个真实bug报告，揭示了同步不一致和化身异常是最常见症状，网络/同步逻辑缺陷和会话管理问题是主要根源，超过34%的bug会导致严重破坏共享体验的后果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多用户XR系统引入了独特的软件缺陷，影响用户体验，但目前对此类缺陷的理解仍不足，需要进行系统性的实证研究来填补这一空白。

Method: 通过定性分析使用迭代开放编码方法，从开发者论坛、GitHub仓库和主流XR应用商店的应用评论中收集和分析2,649个真实bug报告。

Result: 开发了包含症状表现、根源原因和后果严重性三个维度的综合分类法，发现同步不一致和化身相关异常是最普遍症状，网络/同步逻辑缺陷和会话管理缺陷是主要根源，超过34%的bug会导致系统崩溃、持续断开连接和完全交互中断等严重后果。

Conclusion: 多用户XR系统在分布式系统、实时3D交互和沉浸式体验的交叉点面临独特挑战，需要专门的测试、调试和质量保证方法，并为开发者、平台供应商和研究人员提供了可操作的建议。

Abstract: Multi-user Extended Reality (XR) systems enable transformative shared
experiences but introduce unique software defects that compromise user
experience. Understanding software defects in multi-user XR systems is crucial
for enhancing system reliability, yet remains underexplored. To fill the gap,
this paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of multi-user XR
defects, analyzing 2,649 real-world bug reports from diverse sources, including
developer forums, GitHub repositories, and app reviews on mainstream XR app
stores. Through rigorous qualitative analysis using iterative open coding, we
develop a comprehensive taxonomy that classifies multi-user XR bugs along three
dimensions: Symptom Manifestation, Root Cause Origin, and Consequence Severity.
Our findings reveal that synchronization inconsistencies and avatar-related
anomalies are the most prevalent symptoms, while network/synchronization logic
defects and session management flaws emerge as dominant root causes.
Critically, over 34% of analyzed bugs lead to severe consequences that
fundamentally break the shared experience, including system crashes, persistent
disconnections, and complete interaction breakdowns, etc. We also identify
concerning privacy and health implications unique to multi-user XR contexts.
Based on our findings of defect analysis, we provide actionable recommendations
for developers, platform vendors, and researchers. Our results demonstrate that
multi-user XR systems face distinct challenges at the intersection of
distributed systems, real-time 3D interaction, and immersive experiences,
necessitating specialized approaches to testing, debugging, and quality
assurance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典项链分割问题在公平分配中有重要应用，但现有方法仅限于静态场景。需要扩展到动态环境以支持实时更新操作。

Method: 针对双色情况开发线性时间最优算法支持所有动态更新；针对多色情况在代理数量限制下提供线性时间最优重定位算法；提出随机算法保证高概率近似公平。

Result: 双色动态项链分割问题获得线性时间最优解；多色重定位在代理数限制下实现线性时间最优；随机算法在小代理数时达到多对数时间复杂度。

Conclusion: 成功将项链分割扩展到动态场景，为数据驱动的公平哈希映射等应用提供了高效解决方案，平衡了最优性和计算效率。

Abstract: The necklace splitting problem is a classic problem in fair division with
many applications, including data-informed fair hash maps. We extend necklace
splitting to a dynamic setting, allowing for relocation, insertion, and
deletion of beads. We present linear-time, optimal algorithms for the two-color
case that support all dynamic updates. For more than two colors, we give
linear-time, optimal algorithms for relocation subject to a restriction on the
number of agents. Finally, we propose a randomized algorithm for the two-color
case that handles all dynamic updates, guarantees approximate fairness with
high probability, and runs in polylogarithmic time when the number of agents is
small.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究合作在战略环境中的影响是算法博弈论的核心问题。直觉上，允许更多合作应该能产生对社会更有利的均衡，但许多游戏中仍不清楚需要多少合作才能确保良好的社会福利。

Method: 分析网络形成游戏中不同合作程度的解概念下的无政府代价。游戏模型涉及自私代理通过购买加权宿主图中的边来增加自身中心性，边成本与其长度成正比，需要两端点共同支付。

Result: 在任意边权重的宿主图上，即使最强形式的合作也无法改善无政府代价。但在度量边权重的宿主图上，合作具有显著正面影响，通过新颖证明技术获得了渐近紧界的无政府代价界限。

Conclusion: 合作在网络形成游戏中的影响取决于宿主图的边权重特性：在度量权重下合作能显著改善社会福利，但在任意权重下无效。所开发的证明技术可应用于其他具有度量权重的模型。

Abstract: Studying the impact of cooperation in strategic settings is one of the
cornerstones of algorithmic game theory. Intuitively, allowing more cooperation
yields equilibria that are more beneficial for the society of agents. However,
for many games it is still an open question how much cooperation is actually
needed to ensure socially good equilibria. We contribute to this research
endeavor by analyzing the benefits of cooperation in a network formation game
that models the creation of communication networks via the interaction of
selfish agents. In our game, agents that correspond to nodes of a network can
buy incident edges of a given weighted host graph to increase their centrality
in the formed network. The cost of an edge is proportional to its length, and
both endpoints must agree and pay for an edge to be created. This setting is
known for having a high price of anarchy.
  To uncover the impact of cooperation, we investigate the price of anarchy of
our network formation game with respect to multiple solution concepts that
allow for varying amounts of cooperation. On the negative side, we show that on
host graphs with arbitrary edge weights even the strongest form of cooperation
cannot improve the price of anarchy. In contrast to this, as our main result,
we show that cooperation has a significant positive impact if the given host
graph has metric edge weights. For this, we prove asymptotically tight bounds
on the price of anarchy via a novel proof technique that might be of
independent interest and can be applied in other models with metric weights.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了"资本博弈"，其中玩家收益已知但未必是冯·诺依曼-摩根斯坦效用，收益动态决定效用函数，并提出了"增长均衡"概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究非标准效用函数的博弈情景，其中玩家收益动态决定其效用函数，不同玩家可有不同的收益动态。

Method: 定义资本博弈和增长均衡概念，分析增长均衡与标准博弈纳什均衡之间的对应关系。

Result: 证明了资本博弈的增长均衡与标准博弈的纳什均衡之间存在对应关系。

Conclusion: 提出的增长均衡概念为分析收益动态决定效用的博弈提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: We examine formal games that we call "capital games" in which player payoffs
are known, but their payoffs are not guaranteed to be von Neumann-Morgenstern
utilities. In capital games, the dynamics of player payoffs determine their
utility functions. Different players can have different payoff dynamics. We
make no assumptions about where these dynamics come from, but implicitly assume
that they come from the players' actions and interactions over time. We define
an equilibrium concept called "growth equilibrium" and show a correspondence
between the growth equilibria of capital games and the Nash equilibria of
standard games.

### [247] [Optimizing What Matters: AUC-Driven Learning for Robust Neural Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00137)
*Nima Sheikholeslami,Erfan Hosseini,Patrice Bechard,Srivatsava Daruru,Sai Rajeswar*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出MW损失函数替代对比损失，通过最大化Mann-Whitney U统计量（等同于AUC）来直接优化检索器的排序质量，解决了传统对比损失对分数分离质量不敏感的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的噪声对比估计（NCE）目标虽然广泛使用，但理论证明其对分数分离质量不敏感且与AUC无关，导致检索器校准不佳和下游任务（如RAG）性能次优。

Method: 引入MW损失函数，通过最小化分数差异的二元交叉熵来最大化Mann-Whitney U统计量，直接优化每个正负样本对的正确排序。

Result: 实验表明，使用MW损失训练的检索器在AUC和标准检索指标上持续优于对比损失方法，产生更好校准和更具区分度的检索器。

Conclusion: MW损失是对比损失的经验优越替代方案，特别适用于RAG等高风险应用，能产生更可靠和有效的检索器。

Abstract: Dual-encoder retrievers depend on the principle that relevant documents
should score higher than irrelevant ones for a given query. Yet the dominant
Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) objective, which underpins Contrastive Loss,
optimizes a softened ranking surrogate that we rigorously prove is
fundamentally oblivious to score separation quality and unrelated to AUC. This
mismatch leads to poor calibration and suboptimal performance in downstream
tasks like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). To address this fundamental
limitation, we introduce the MW loss, a new training objective that maximizes
the Mann-Whitney U statistic, which is mathematically equivalent to the Area
under the ROC Curve (AUC). MW loss encourages each positive-negative pair to be
correctly ranked by minimizing binary cross entropy over score differences. We
provide theoretical guarantees that MW loss directly upper-bounds the AoC,
better aligning optimization with retrieval goals. We further promote ROC
curves and AUC as natural threshold free diagnostics for evaluating retriever
calibration and ranking quality. Empirically, retrievers trained with MW loss
consistently outperform contrastive counterparts in AUC and standard retrieval
metrics. Our experiments show that MW loss is an empirically superior
alternative to Contrastive Loss, yielding better-calibrated and more
discriminative retrievers for high-stakes applications like RAG.

TL;DR: HLTCOE团队在TREC 2024 NeuCLIR赛道中应用了PLAID mT5重排序器、GPT-4重排序器、分数融合和文档翻译技术，并在报告生成任务中尝试了基于分解子问题的系统组合方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨语言信息检索(CLIR)和多语言信息检索(MLIR)中的挑战，特别是在新闻和技术文档检索以及报告生成任务中提升性能。

Method: 使用多种PLAID模型训练技术（TD、GD、MTD），结合GPT-4重排序和分数融合，在报告生成中采用基于分解子问题的系统组合方法，使用GPT-4o和Claude-3.5-Sonnet进行结果总结和验证。

Result: 团队提交了所有NeuCLIR任务的运行结果，包括CLIR和MLIR新闻任务、技术文档任务以及报告生成任务。

Conclusion: 通过多种重排序技术和系统组合方法，在跨语言和多语言信息检索任务中取得了有效的结果，特别是在报告生成方面展示了基于分解查询的方法的可行性。

Abstract: The HLTCOE team applied PLAID, an mT5 reranker, GPT-4 reranker, score fusion,
and document translation to the TREC 2024 NeuCLIR track. For PLAID we included
a variety of models and training techniques -- Translate Distill (TD), Generate
Distill (GD) and multi-lingual translate-distill (MTD). TD uses scores from the
mT5 model over English MS MARCO query-document pairs to learn how to score
query-document pairs where the documents are translated to match the CLIR
setting. GD follows TD but uses passages from the collection and queries
generated by an LLM for training examples. MTD uses MS MARCO translated into
multiple languages, allowing experiments on how to batch the data during
training. Finally, for report generation we experimented with system
combination over different runs. One family of systems used either GPT-4o or
Claude-3.5-Sonnet to summarize the retrieved results from a series of
decomposed sub-questions. Another system took the output from those two models
and verified/combined them with Claude-3.5-Sonnet. The other family used GPT4o
and GPT3.5Turbo to extract and group relevant facts from the retrieved
documents based on the decomposed queries. The resulting submissions directly
concatenate the grouped facts to form the report and their documents of origin
as the citations. The team submitted runs to all NeuCLIR tasks: CLIR and MLIR
news tasks as well as the technical documents task and the report generation
task.

TL;DR: 提出了第一个支持动态更新的、强历史独立的、鲁棒的学习增强数据结构，通过阈值化和配对技术实现安全与效率的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习增强数据结构虽然能利用频率预测优化性能，但其隐私和安全影响尚未充分研究。在安全漏洞事件中，数据结构应尽可能少地泄露信息，特别是那些布局会随数据变化的结构。

Method: 引入两种技术：阈值化（使任何学习增强数据结构具有鲁棒性）和配对（在动态设置中提供强历史独立性的简单技术）。

Result: 实验结果显示安全性和效率之间存在权衡，但性能仍能与最先进技术竞争。

Conclusion: 这是向学习增强数据结构提供隐私和安全保证的第一步，提出的方法在保持鲁棒性的同时实现了强历史独立性。

Abstract: Learning-augmented data structures use predicted frequency estimates to
retrieve frequently occurring database elements faster than standard data
structures. Recent work has developed data structures that optimally exploit
these frequency estimates while maintaining robustness to adversarial
prediction errors. However, the privacy and security implications of this
setting remain largely unexplored.
  In the event of a security breach, data structures should reveal minimal
information beyond their current contents. This is even more crucial for
learning-augmented data structures, whose layout adapts to the data. A data
structure is history independent if its memory representation reveals no
information about past operations except what is inferred from its current
contents. In this work, we take the first step towards privacy and security
guarantees in this setting by proposing the first learning-augmented data
structure that is strongly history independent, robust, and supports dynamic
updates.
  To achieve this, we introduce two techniques: thresholding, which
automatically makes any learning-augmented data structure robust, and pairing,
a simple technique that provides strong history independence in the dynamic
setting. Our experimental results demonstrate a tradeoff between security and
efficiency but are still competitive with the state of the art.

TL;DR: MILCO是一种多语言稀疏检索架构，通过多语言连接器将不同语言的查询和文档映射到共享的英语词汇空间，结合稀疏对齐预训练和对比训练，在保持表示透明性和有效性的同时缓解语义崩溃问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的学习稀疏检索方法难以扩展到英语以外的语言，且罕见实体在投影到英语时容易丢失。

Method: 采用两阶段训练机制：稀疏对齐预训练和对比训练，并引入LexEcho头来增强鲁棒性，通过[ECHO]令牌将源语言视图与英语词汇表示相结合。

Result: MILCO在多语言和跨语言LSR任务中达到最先进性能，优于BGE-M3和Qwen3-Embed等基线模型，且支持通过后剪枝实现动态效率。

Conclusion: MILCO在保持高效性的同时实现了卓越的多语言检索性能，特别是在稀疏表示下仍能超越更大模型的性能。

Abstract: Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) combines the efficiency of bi-encoders with
the transparency of lexical matching, but existing approaches struggle to scale
beyond English. We introduce MILCO, an LSR architecture that maps queries and
documents from different languages into a shared English lexical space via a
multilingual connector. MILCO is trained with a specialized two-stage regime
that combines Sparse Alignment Pretraining with contrastive training to provide
representation transparency and effectiveness while mitigating semantic
collapse. Motivated by the observation that uncommon entities are often lost
when projected into English, we propose a new LexEcho head, which enhances
robustness by augmenting the English lexical representation with a
source-language view obtained through a special [ECHO] token. MILCO achieves
state-of-the-art multilingual and cross-lingual LSR performance, outperforming
leading dense, sparse, and multi-vector baselines such as BGE-M3 and
Qwen3-Embed on standard multilingual benchmarks, while supporting dynamic
efficiency through post-hoc pruning. Notably, when using mass-based pruning to
reduce document representations to only 30 active dimensions on average, MILCO
560M outperforms the similarly-sized Qwen3-Embed 0.6B with 1024 dimensions.

TL;DR: L2G是一个新颖的框架，通过从列表式重排序器日志中隐式诱导文档图，实现了无需显式图计算的可扩展图检索方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图感知自适应检索(GAR)需要预计算的文档相似图，但这类图通常不可用或内存成本过高；而图无关重排序器依赖大量LLM调用。L2G旨在结合两者的优势。

Method: 通过将重排序器信号转换为图结构，隐式地从列表式重排序器日志中诱导文档图，实现无需显式图计算的图检索。

Result: 在TREC-DL和BEIR子集上的结果显示，L2G与基于oracle的图方法效果相当，且无需额外的LLM调用。

Conclusion: L2G框架成功地将重排序器信号转化为图结构，实现了高效且可扩展的图检索，在保持性能的同时避免了显式图计算的开销。

Abstract: Reranker improves retrieval performance by capturing document interactions.
At one extreme, graph-aware adaptive retrieval (GAR) represents an
information-rich regime, requiring a pre-computed document similarity graph in
reranking. However, as such graphs are often unavailable, or incur quadratic
memory costs even when available, graph-free rerankers leverage large language
model (LLM) calls to achieve competitive performance. We introduce L2G, a novel
framework that implicitly induces document graphs from listwise reranker logs.
By converting reranker signals into a graph structure, L2G enables scalable
graph-based retrieval without the overhead of explicit graph computation.
Results on the TREC-DL and BEIR subset show that L2G matches the effectiveness
of oracle-based graph methods, while incurring zero additional LLM calls.

Method: 采用综述研究方法，结构化分析CLIR的核心组件，包括查询扩展、排序、重排序和问答等流程，涵盖从翻译方法到嵌入方法和生成方法的演进。

Conclusion: 通过将CLIR置于信息检索和多语言处理的大背景下，不仅回顾了当前能力，还为构建稳健、包容和适应性强的检索系统指明了未来方向。

Abstract: Cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) addresses the challenge of
retrieving relevant documents written in languages different from that of the
original query. Research in this area has typically framed the task as
monolingual retrieval augmented by translation, treating retrieval methods and
cross-lingual capabilities in isolation. Both monolingual and cross-lingual
retrieval usually follow a pipeline of query expansion, ranking, re-ranking
and, increasingly, question answering. Recent advances, however, have shifted
from translation-based methods toward embedding-based approaches and leverage
multilingual large language models (LLMs), for which aligning representations
across languages remains a central challenge. The emergence of cross-lingual
embeddings and multilingual LLMs has introduced a new paradigm, offering
improved retrieval performance and enabling answer generation. This survey
provides a comprehensive overview of developments from early translation-based
methods to state-of-the-art embedding-driven and generative techniques. It
presents a structured account of core CLIR components, evaluation practices,
and available resources. Persistent challenges such as data imbalance and
linguistic variation are identified, while promising directions are suggested
for advancing equitable and effective cross-lingual information retrieval. By
situating CLIR within the broader landscape of information retrieval and
multilingual language processing, this work not only reviews current
capabilities but also outlines future directions for building retrieval systems
that are robust, inclusive, and adaptable.

Motivation: 由于互联网信息爆炸，需要开发聚合搜索系统来提升各种格式内容的检索和管理。传统搜索引擎存在不精确、缺乏上下文相关性和个性化的问题，因此需要更丰富的上下文感知搜索结果显示。

Method: 使用堆叠自编码器和AraBERT嵌入进行表示学习，结合K-means聚类算法来发现搜索结果中的特征和关系，并在不同的阿拉伯语查询上评估方法有效性。

Result: 模型表明堆叠自编码器在表示学习中适合聚类任务，能显著改进搜索结果聚类，同时展示了搜索结果的准确性和相关性提升。

Conclusion: 堆叠自编码器在表示学习中的使用特别适合聚类任务，能够有效提升阿拉伯语搜索结果的聚类效果和相关性。

Abstract: Due to an information explosion on the internet, there is a need for the
development of aggregated search systems that can boost the retrieval and
management of content in various formats. To further improve the clustering of
Arabic text data in aggregated search environments, this research investigates
the application of advanced natural language processing techniques, namely
stacked autoencoders and AraBERT embeddings. By transcending the limitations of
traditional search engines, which are imprecise, not contextually relevant, and
not personalized, we offer more enriched, context-aware characterizations of
search results, so we used a K-means clustering algorithm to discover
distinctive features and relationships in these results, we then used our
approach on different Arabic queries to evaluate its effectiveness. Our model
illustrates that using stacked autoencoders in representation learning suits
clustering tasks and can significantly improve clustering search results. It
also demonstrates improved accuracy and relevance of search results.

Conclusion: 通过系统性的方法改进，即使是紧凑的视觉语言模型也能在文档检索任务上取得卓越性能，超越了传统的大规模模型微调方法。

Abstract: Multimodal embedding models are gaining prevalence, notably for document
retrieval as efficient alternatives to text-only pipelines. These models are
typically built by finetuning large vision-language decoders (VLMs) with
contrastive losses on text-image pairs. In this work, we show that, while
cost-efficient, this repurposing approach often bottlenecks retrieval
performance. Through controlled experiments, we establish a principled recipe
for improving visual document retrieval models. We notably measure the impact
of attention masking, image resolution, modality alignment data regimes, and
late interaction centered contrastive objectives which emerge as central
performance factors. Building on these insights, we release ModernVBERT, a
compact 250M-parameter vision-language encoder that outperforms models up to 10
times larger when finetuned on document retrieval tasks. Models and code are
made available at https://huggingface.co/ModernVBERT.

Abstract: Understanding the relationships between objectives in a multiobjective
optimisation problem is important for developing tailored and efficient solving
techniques. In particular, when tackling combinatorial optimisation problems
with many objectives, that arise in real-world logistic scenarios, better
support for the decision maker can be achieved through better understanding of
the often complex fitness landscape. This paper makes a contribution in this
direction by presenting a technique that allows a visualisation and analysis of
the local and global relationships between objectives in optimisation problems
with many objectives. The proposed technique uses four steps: First, the global
pairwise relationships are analysed using the Kendall correlation method; then,
the ranges of the values found on the given Pareto front are estimated and
assessed; next, these ranges are used to plot a map using Gray code, similar to
Karnaugh maps, that has the ability to highlight the trade-offs between
multiple objectives; and finally, local relationships are identified using
scatter plots. Experiments are presented for three combinatorial optimisation
problems: multiobjective multidimensional knapsack problem, multiobjective
nurse scheduling problem, and multiobjective vehicle routing problem with time
windows . Results show that the proposed technique helps in the gaining of
insights into the problem difficulty arising from the relationships between
objectives.

Abstract: Reliably determining the performance of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
systems depends on comprehensive test questions. While a proliferation of
evaluation frameworks for LLM-powered applications exists, current practices
lack a systematic method to ensure these test sets adequately cover the
underlying knowledge base, leaving developers with significant blind spots. To
address this, we present a novel, applied methodology to quantify the semantic
coverage of RAG test questions against their underlying documents. Our approach
leverages existing technologies, including vector embeddings and clustering
algorithms, to create a practical framework for validating test
comprehensiveness. Our methodology embeds document chunks and test questions
into a unified vector space, enabling the calculation of multiple coverage
metrics: basic proximity, content-weighted coverage, and multi-topic question
coverage. Furthermore, we incorporate outlier detection to filter irrelevant
questions, allowing for the refinement of test sets. Experimental evidence from
two distinct use cases demonstrates that our framework effectively quantifies
test coverage, identifies specific content areas with inadequate
representation, and provides concrete recommendations for generating new,
high-value test questions. This work provides RAG developers with essential
tools to build more robust test suites, thereby improving system reliability
and extending to applications such as identifying misaligned documents.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Current approaches for scaling inference-time compute in transformers rely on
training them to emit explicit chain-of-thought tokens before producing an
answer. While these methods are powerful, they are limited because they cannot
be applied during pretraining and are limited to only serially-generated,
natural-language verbalization to scale inference-time compute. In this work,
we propose Thoughtbubbles, a transformer variant that natively performs
parallel adaptive computation in latent space by learning to fork or delete
residual streams. Thus, tokens that require a large amount of computation can
form a "bubble" of cloned residuals in the middle of the network for additional
thinking. Crucially, this behavior is learned during pretraining with only
language modeling loss. Thoughtbubbles outperforms both standard decoder LMs as
well as non-adaptive parallel computation approaches on OpenWebText and peS2o
perplexity and in zero-shot evaluations such as HellaSwag and LAMBADA after
pretraining across 150M to 772M parameter scales. The implicit nature of our
method enables adaptive computation to be learned starting at pretraining time,
paving the way to unify train and test-time behavior for reasoning models.

Conclusion: 学习等变性可以成为等变或基于数据增强的MLIP模型的有力且高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Accurate and scalable machine-learned inter-atomic potentials (MLIPs) are
essential for molecular simulations ranging from drug discovery to new material
design. Current state-of-the-art models enforce roto-translational symmetries
through equivariant neural network architectures, a hard-wired inductive bias
that can often lead to reduced flexibility, computational efficiency, and
scalability. In this work, we introduce TransIP: Transformer-based Inter-Atomic
Potentials, a novel training paradigm for interatomic potentials achieving
symmetry compliance without explicit architectural constraints. Our approach
guides a generic non-equivariant Transformer-based model to learn
SO(3)-equivariance by optimizing its representations in the embedding space.
Trained on the recent Open Molecules (OMol25) collection, a large and diverse
molecular dataset built specifically for MLIPs and covering different types of
molecules (including small organics, biomolecular fragments, and
electrolyte-like species), TransIP attains comparable performance in
machine-learning force fields versus state-of-the-art equivariant baselines.
Further, compared to a data augmentation baseline, TransIP achieves 40% to 60%
improvement in performance across varying OMol25 dataset sizes. More broadly,
our work shows that learned equivariance can be a powerful and efficient
alternative to equivariant or augmentation-based MLIP models.

Conclusion: 符号程序合成与数值优化相结合能够产生既可解释又高性能的策略，弥合了语言模型引导设计与经典控制调优之间的差距

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have shown promise as generators of symbolic
control policies, producing interpretable program-like representations through
iterative search. However, these models are not capable of separating the
functional structure of a policy from the numerical values it is parametrized
by, thus making the search process slow and inefficient. We propose a hybrid
approach that decouples structural synthesis from parameter optimization by
introducing an additional optimization layer for local parameter search. In our
method, the numerical parameters of LLM-generated programs are extracted and
optimized numerically to maximize task performance. With this integration, an
LLM iterates over the functional structure of programs, while a separate
optimization loop is used to find a locally optimal set of parameters
accompanying candidate programs. We evaluate our method on a set of control
tasks, showing that it achieves higher returns and improved sample efficiency
compared to purely LLM-guided search. We show that combining symbolic program
synthesis with numerical optimization yields interpretable yet high-performing
policies, bridging the gap between language-model-guided design and classical
control tuning. Our code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展大语言模型的上下文窗口对于长距离依赖任务至关重要，但RoPE位置插值与后训练量化结合会导致精度下降，需要解决这一耦合效应问题。

Method: 提出Q-ROAR方法：将RoPE维度分组到少量频率带，对Key和Query权重进行轻量级搜索，使用插值压力和尾部膨胀比作为诊断指标，无需微调或架构修改。

Result: Q-ROAR在长上下文工作负载上使模型困惑度降低超过14%，同时保持短上下文性能、推理吞吐量和现有LLM系统栈兼容性。

Conclusion: Q-ROAR提供了一种有效的量化感知位置插值稳定方法，解决了RoPE插值与PTQ结合时的精度下降问题，具有实用性和兼容性优势。

Abstract: Extending the context window support of large language models (LLMs) is
crucial for tasks with long-distance dependencies. RoPE-based interpolation and
extrapolation methods, such as linear scaling and frequency-aware schemes,
enable longer input length support without retraining, while post-training
quantization (PTQ) makes deployment practical. However, we show that combining
RoPE position interpolation (PI) with PTQ degrades accuracy due to coupled
effects including long-context aliasing, dynamic-range dilation, anisotropy
from axis-aligned quantizers vs. rotated RoPE pairs, and outlier shifting that
produces position-dependent logit noise. We provide, to the best of our
knowledge, the first systematic analysis of the PI+PTQ approach and introduce
two practical diagnostics: interpolation pressure (per-band sensitivity to
phase scaling) and tail-inflation ratios (outlier shift from short to long
contexts). Following the analysis results, we propose Q-ROAR (Quantization,
RoPE-interpolation, and Outlier Aware Rescaling), a weight-only,
interpolation-aware stabilization of PI for quantized LLMs. Q-ROAR groups RoPE
dimensions into a small number of frequency bands and performs a lightweight
search over per-band scales for Key and Query weights (with an optional
symmetric variant to preserve logit scale). The search is guided by our
diagnostics and uses a tiny long-context development dataset, requiring no
fine-tuning to the model, no architecture or kernel changes, and no additional
deployment overhead. Empirically, Q-ROAR reduces the model's perplexity on
long-context workloads by more than 14%, while preserving short-context
performance, inference throughput, and compatibility with existing LLM system
stacks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种物理信息极限学习机(PIELM)框架，用于分析隧道开挖引起的土-桩相互作用，结合物理方程和实测数据，实现快速训练和实时监测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理信息机器学习在地质工程中具有潜力，需要开发结合物理知识和数据驱动的方法来准确分析隧道开挖对桩基的影响。

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning has been a promising data-driven and
physics-informed approach in geotechnical engineering. This study proposes a
physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) framework for analyzing
tunneling-induced soil-pile interactions. The pile foundation is modeled as an
Euler-Bernoulli beam, and the surrounding soil is modeled as a Pasternak
foundation. The soil-pile interaction is formulated into a fourth-order
ordinary differential equation (ODE) that constitutes the physics-informed
component, while measured data are incorporated into PIELM as the data-driven
component. Combining physics and data yields a loss vector of the extreme
learning machine (ELM) network, which is trained within 1 second by the least
squares method. After validating the PIELM approach by the boundary element
method (BEM) and finite difference method (FDM), parametric studies are carried
out to examine the effects of ELM network architecture, data monitoring
locations and numbers on the performance of PIELM. The results indicate that
monitored data should be placed at positions where the gradients of pile
deflections are significant, such as at the pile tip/top and near tunneling
zones. Two application examples highlight the critical role of physics-informed
and data-driven approach for tunnelling-induced soil-pile interactions. The
proposed approach shows great potential for real-time monitoring and safety
assessment of pile foundations, and benefits for intelligent early-warning
systems in geotechnical engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有健康基准多为通用型、面向临床医生或聚焦临床任务，缺乏针对糖尿病患者日常管理决策的专门评估框架。

Method: 收集15,000名糖尿病患者一个月的连续血糖监测数据和行为日志，生成36万多个个性化问题，评估8个LLM在7类任务和5个指标上的表现。

Result: 不同模型在不同任务和指标上表现差异显著，没有单一模型在所有维度上表现最优。

Conclusion: DexBench基准旨在提升糖尿病护理AI解决方案的可靠性、安全性、有效性和实用性。

Abstract: We present DexBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate large language
model (LLM) performance across real-world decision-making tasks faced by
individuals managing diabetes in their daily lives. Unlike prior health
benchmarks that are either generic, clinician-facing or focused on clinical
tasks (e.g., diagnosis, triage), DexBench introduces a comprehensive evaluation
framework tailored to the unique challenges of prototyping patient-facing AI
solutions in diabetes, glucose management, metabolic health and related
domains. Our benchmark encompasses 7 distinct task categories, reflecting the
breadth of real-world questions individuals with diabetes ask, including basic
glucose interpretation, educational queries, behavioral associations, advanced
decision making and long term planning. Towards this end, we compile a rich
dataset comprising one month of time-series data encompassing glucose traces
and metrics from continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and behavioral logs (e.g.,
eating and activity patterns) from 15,000 individuals across three different
diabetes populations (type 1, type 2, pre-diabetes/general health and
wellness). Using this data, we generate a total of 360,600 personalized,
contextual questions across the 7 tasks. We evaluate model performance on these
tasks across 5 metrics: accuracy, groundedness, safety, clarity and
actionability. Our analysis of 8 recent LLMs reveals substantial variability
across tasks and metrics; no single model consistently outperforms others
across all dimensions. By establishing this benchmark, we aim to advance the
reliability, safety, effectiveness and practical utility of AI solutions in
diabetes care.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了在p-adic度量空间中机器学习的新理论框架，证明p-adic回归必须通过至少n+1个数据点，这与欧几里得回归形成鲜明对比，更适合处理层次化数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习方法使用欧几里得度量无法有效捕捉层次化数据的离散分支特性，需要更适合处理层次结构的数学框架。

Method: 建立p-adic度量空间的机器学习理论基础，证明p-adic回归的数学性质，并通过自然语言处理中的层次分类和语法形态学建模进行验证。

Result: 证明了n维p-adic回归平面必须通过至少n+1个数据点，多项式回归也有类似性质，这反映了层次化数据中插值不如选择实际观测点作为代表的特性。

Conclusion: p-adic度量可能是处理机器学习中层次化数据结构的基础工具，能更好地适应层次数据的离散特性。

Abstract: Many real-world machine learning problems involve inherently hierarchical
data, yet traditional approaches rely on Euclidean metrics that fail to capture
the discrete, branching nature of hierarchical relationships. We present a
theoretical foundation for machine learning in p-adic metric spaces, which
naturally respect hierarchical structure. Our main result proves that an
n-dimensional plane minimizing the p-adic sum of distances to points in a
dataset must pass through at least n + 1 of those points -- a striking contrast
to Euclidean regression that highlights how p-adic metrics better align with
the discrete nature of hierarchical data. As a corollary, a polynomial of
degree n constructed to minimise the p-adic sum of residuals will pass through
at least n + 1 points. As a further corollary, a polynomial of degree n
approximating a higher degree polynomial at a finite number of points will
yield a difference polynomial that has distinct rational roots. We demonstrate
the practical significance of this result through two applications in natural
language processing: analyzing hierarchical taxonomies and modeling grammatical
morphology. These results suggest that p-adic metrics may be fundamental to
properly handling hierarchical data structures in machine learning. In
hierarchical data, interpolation between points often makes less sense than
selecting actual observed points as representatives.

Motivation: 解决SNN由于脉冲机制的非可微性和稀疏性导致的梯度传播训练困难问题，寻找更高效的训练方法。

Method: 将随机特征方法从ANN适配到脉冲响应模型SNN，提出S-SWIM算法，通过数据驱动方式训练SNN，避免脉冲函数梯度近似。

Result: S-SWIM在时间序列预测中达到高精度，作为独立策略表现良好，且作为梯度训练前的初始化策略效果优于随机权重采样。

Conclusion: S-SWIM为SNN训练提供了一种高效、可解释的替代方案，既可作为独立训练方法，也可作为传统梯度训练的优化初始化策略。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) as Machine Learning (ML) models have recently
received a lot of attention as a potentially more energy-efficient alternative
to conventional Artificial Neural Networks. The non-differentiability and
sparsity of the spiking mechanism can make these models very difficult to train
with algorithms based on propagating gradients through the spiking
non-linearity. We address this problem by adapting the paradigm of Random
Feature Methods (RFMs) from Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to Spike Response
Model (SRM) SNNs. This approach allows training of SNNs without approximation
of the spike function gradient. Concretely, we propose a novel data-driven,
fast, high-performance, and interpretable algorithm for end-to-end training of
SNNs inspired by the SWIM algorithm for RFM-ANNs, which we coin S-SWIM. We
provide a thorough theoretical discussion and supplementary numerical
experiments showing that S-SWIM can reach high accuracies on time series
forecasting as a standalone strategy and serve as an effective initialisation
strategy before gradient-based training. Additional ablation studies show that
our proposed method performs better than random sampling of network weights.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedLLM-Align是一个联邦学习框架，利用预训练大语言模型作为通用特征提取器，将表格数据序列化为文本，生成语义对齐的嵌入表示，解决联邦学习中表格数据异构性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在隐私敏感领域应用广泛，但表格数据的异构性（不同客户端间的模式差异和不兼容特征空间）阻碍了直接聚合，需要一种无需手动模式对齐的解决方案。

Method: 使用预训练LLM（如DistilBERT、ALBERT等）作为特征提取器，将表格记录序列化为文本，生成语义对齐的嵌入表示，在标准FedAvg协议下支持轻量级本地分类器。

Result: 在冠心病预测任务中，所有客户端设置和LLM骨干网络下，FedLLM-Align均优于现有方法，F1分数提升高达+0.25，通信成本降低65%。在极端模式差异下表现稳健。

Conclusion: FedLLM-Align为异构环境下的联邦学习提供了一个鲁棒、隐私保护且通信高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing
raw data, making it attractive for privacy-sensitive domains such as
healthcare, finance, and IoT. A major obstacle, however, is the heterogeneity
of tabular data across clients, where divergent schemas and incompatible
feature spaces prevent straightforward aggregation. To address this challenge,
we propose FedLLM-Align, a federated framework that leverages pre-trained large
language models (LLMs) as universal feature extractors. Tabular records are
serialized into text, and embeddings from models such as DistilBERT, ALBERT,
RoBERTa, and ClinicalBERT provide semantically aligned representations that
support lightweight local classifiers under the standard FedAvg protocol. This
approach removes the need for manual schema harmonization while preserving
privacy, since raw data remain strictly local. We evaluate FedLLM-Align on
coronary heart disease prediction using partitioned Framingham datasets with
simulated schema divergence. Across all client settings and LLM backbones, our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to
+0.25 improvement in F1-score and a 65% reduction in communication cost. Stress
testing under extreme schema divergence further demonstrates graceful
degradation, unlike traditional methods that collapse entirely. These results
establish FedLLM-Align as a robust, privacy-preserving, and
communication-efficient solution for federated learning in heterogeneous
environments.

Abstract: Foundation models have reshaped AI by unifying fragmented architectures into
scalable backbones with multimodal reasoning and contextual adaptation. In
parallel, the long-standing notion of AI agents, defined by the
sensing-decision-action loop, is entering a new paradigm: with FMs as their
cognitive core, agents transcend rule-based behaviors to achieve autonomy,
generalization, and self-reflection. This dual shift is reinforced by
real-world demands such as autonomous driving, robotics, virtual assistants,
and GUI agents, as well as ecosystem advances in embedded hardware, edge
computing, mobile deployment platforms, and communication protocols that
together enable large-scale deployment. Yet this convergence collides with
reality: while applications demand long-term adaptability and real-time
interaction, mobile and edge deployments remain constrained by memory, energy,
bandwidth, and latency. This creates a fundamental tension between the growing
complexity of FMs and the limited resources of deployment environments. This
survey provides the first systematic characterization of adaptive,
resource-efficient agentic AI systems. We summarize enabling techniques into
elastic inference, test-time adaptation, dynamic multimodal integration, and
agentic AI applications, and identify open challenges in balancing
accuracy-latency-communication trade-offs and sustaining robustness under
distribution shifts. We further highlight future opportunities in
algorithm-system co-design, cognitive adaptation, and collaborative edge
deployment. By mapping FM structures, cognition, and hardware resources, this
work establishes a unified perspective toward scalable, adaptive, and
resource-efficient agentic AI. We believe this survey can help readers to
understand the connections between enabling technologies while promoting
further discussions on the fusion of agentic intelligence and intelligent
agents.

Conclusion: 近似单峰似然模型能够更好地适应真实序数数据的分布特性，在保持单峰结构优势的同时缓解了严格单峰模型的偏差问题。

Abstract: Ordinal regression (OR, also called ordinal classification) is classification
of ordinal data, in which the underlying target variable is categorical and
considered to have a natural ordinal relation for the underlying explanatory
variable. A key to successful OR models is to find a data structure `natural
ordinal relation' common to many ordinal data and reflect that structure into
the design of those models. A recent OR study found that many real-world
ordinal data show a tendency that the conditional probability distribution
(CPD) of the target variable given a value of the explanatory variable will
often be unimodal. Several previous studies thus developed unimodal likelihood
models, in which a predicted CPD is guaranteed to become unimodal. However, it
was also observed experimentally that many real-world ordinal data partly have
values of the explanatory variable where the underlying CPD will be
non-unimodal, and hence unimodal likelihood models may suffer from a bias for
such a CPD. Therefore, motivated to mitigate such a bias, we propose
approximately unimodal likelihood models, which can represent up to a unimodal
CPD and a CPD that is close to be unimodal. We also verify experimentally that
a proposed model can be effective for statistical modeling of ordinal data and
OR tasks.

Abstract: We introduce BigBang-Proton, a unified sequence-based architecture for
auto-regressive language modeling pretrained on cross-scale, cross-structure,
cross-discipline real-world scientific tasks to construct a scientific
multi-task learner. BigBang-Proton incorporates three fundamental innovations
compared to mainstream general-purpose LLMs: Theory-Experiment Learning
paradigm aligns large-scale numerical experimental data with theoretical text
corpora; Binary Patch Encoding replaces byte pair encoding(BPE) tokenization;
Monte Carlo Attention substitutes traditional transformer architectures.
Through next-word-prediction pretraining on cross-discipline scientific
datasets of real-world problems mixed with general textual corpus, followed by
fine-tuning and inference on downstream tasks, BigBang-Proton demonstrates
100\% accuracy in up to 50-digit arithmetic addition operations, performance on
par with leading specialized models in particle physics jet tagging, matching
MAE of specialized models in inter-atomic potential simulation, performance
comparable to traditional spatiotemporal models in water quality prediction,
and benchmark-exceeding performance in genome modeling. These results prove
that language-guided scientific computing can match or exceed the performance
of task-specific scientific models while maintaining multitask learning
capabilities. We further hypothesize to scale the pretraining to the universe
scale as a fundamental step toward developing material world foundational
model.

Conclusion: NeurTransformer方法成功实现了transformer到SNN的高效转换，在保持性能的同时显著降低了能耗，为大规模transformer模型的节能部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Foundational models based on the transformer architecture are currently the
state-of-the-art in general language modeling, as well as in scientific areas
such as material science and climate. However, training and deploying these
models is computationally challenging as the time and space complexity has a
quadratic relation to the input sequence length. Several efforts exploring
efficient computational paradigms and model architectures to address these
limitations have been made. In this work, we explore spiking neural networks
(SNNs) to design transformer models. A challenge in training large-scale SNNs,
using existing surrogate learning methods is inefficient and time-consuming. On
the other hand, techniques to convert existing transformer-based models to
their SNN equivalent are not scalable, as achieving optimal performance comes
at the cost of a large number of spike time-steps, i.e. increased latency. To
address this, we propose NeurTransformer, a methodology for designing
transformer-based SNN for inference using a supervised fine-tuning approach
with existing conversion methods. The proposed methodology works by: (1)
replacing the self-attention mechanism with a spike-based self-attention (SSA),
(2) converting the feed-forward block of the trained transformer model to its
equivalent SNN, and (3) fine-tuning the SSA block using SNN-based surrogate
learning algorithms. We benchmark the proposed methodology and demonstrate its
accuracy and scalability using three variants of the GPT-2 model of increasing
model size. We observe that the converted GPT-2 small models demonstrate a
5-12% loss in cosine similarity and a 9.7% reduction in perplexity. Finally, we
demonstrate the energy efficiency of the SSA block compared to the ASA block
and show between 64.71% and 85.28% reductions in estimated energy consumption
when implementing the self-attention mechanism on a digital hardware.

Abstract: We are born with the ability to learn concepts by comparing diverse
observations. This helps us to understand the new world in a compositional
manner and facilitates extrapolation, as objects naturally consist of multiple
concepts. In this work, we argue that the cognitive mechanism of comparison,
fundamental to human learning, is also vital for machines to recover true
concepts underlying the data. This offers correctness guarantees for the field
of concept learning, which, despite its impressive empirical successes, still
lacks general theoretical support. Specifically, we aim to develop a
theoretical framework for the identifiability of concepts with multiple classes
of observations. We show that with sufficient diversity across classes, hidden
concepts can be identified without assuming specific concept types, functional
relations, or parametric generative models. Interestingly, even when conditions
are not globally satisfied, we can still provide alternative guarantees for as
many concepts as possible based on local comparisons, thereby extending the
applicability of our theory to more flexible scenarios. Moreover, the hidden
structure between classes and concepts can also be identified
nonparametrically. We validate our theoretical results in both synthetic and
real-world settings.

Motivation: 在实际问题中，获取大量奖励标签通常不可行，特别是在依赖人类反馈时。当强化学习必须在有限反馈下进行时，需要研究哪些样本应该被标注奖励才能最大化策略性能。

Method: 研究两种选择策略：(i) 依赖无奖励信息的启发式方法，如状态访问和部分价值函数；(ii) 使用辅助评估反馈预训练的策略。

Result: 有效的选择方法能够用显著少于完全监督的奖励标签数量获得接近最优的策略，关键奖励子集是那些能引导最优轨迹和支持行为恢复的奖励。

Conclusion: 奖励选择是在反馈受限环境中扩展强化学习的有力范式，能够显著减少所需的奖励标注数量。

Abstract: The ability of reinforcement learning algorithms to learn effective policies
is determined by the rewards available during training. However, for practical
problems, obtaining large quantities of reward labels is often infeasible due
to computational or financial constraints, particularly when relying on human
feedback. When reinforcement learning must proceed with limited feedback --
only a fraction of samples get rewards labeled -- a fundamental question
arises: which samples should be labeled to maximize policy performance? We
formalize this problem of reward selection for reinforcement learning from
limited feedback (RLLF), introducing a new problem formulation that facilitates
the study of strategies for selecting impactful rewards. Two types of selection
strategies are investigated: (i) heuristics that rely on reward-free
information such as state visitation and partial value functions, and (ii)
strategies pre-trained using auxiliary evaluative feedback. We find that
critical subsets of rewards are those that (1) guide the agent along optimal
trajectories, and (2) support recovery toward near-optimal behavior after
deviations. Effective selection methods yield near-optimal policies with
significantly fewer reward labels than full supervision, establishing reward
selection as a powerful paradigm for scaling reinforcement learning in
feedback-limited settings.

Abstract: The wide adoption of AI decision-making systems in critical domains such as
criminal justice, loan approval, and hiring processes has heightened concerns
about algorithmic fairness. As we often only have access to the output of
algorithms without insights into their internal mechanisms, it was natural to
examine how decisions would alter when auxiliary sensitive attributes (such as
race) change. This led the research community to come up with counterfactual
fairness measures, but how to evaluate the measure from available data remains
a challenging task. In many practical applications, the target counterfactual
measure is not identifiable, i.e., it cannot be uniquely determined from the
combination of quantitative data and qualitative knowledge. This paper
addresses this challenge using partial identification, which derives
informative bounds over counterfactual fairness measures from observational
data. We introduce a Bayesian approach to bound unknown counterfactual fairness
measures with high confidence. We demonstrate our algorithm on the COMPAS
dataset, examining fairness in recidivism risk scores with respect to race,
age, and sex. Our results reveal a positive (spurious) effect on the COMPAS
score when changing race to African-American (from all others) and a negative
(direct causal) effect when transitioning from young to old age.

TL;DR: 该论文通过逆向工程研究语言模型学习多位数乘法的机制，发现成功模型通过注意力构建有向无环图来缓存和检索部分乘积，使用傅里叶基表示数字，而标准微调模型缺乏这种长程依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型为何在看似简单的多位数乘法任务上失败，通过分析成功学习乘法的模型来理解其内部机制。

Method: 逆向工程分析成功学习乘法的模型，使用logit归因和线性探针研究长程依赖关系，分析注意力机制如何构建有向无环图来缓存和检索部分乘积。

Result: 发现成功模型编码了必要的长程依赖关系，通过注意力机制实现部分乘积的Minkowski求和，使用傅里叶基表示数字，而标准微调模型缺乏这些机制。

Conclusion: 通过逆向工程揭示了Transformer学习长程依赖关系的陷阱，并展示了正确的归纳偏置如何解决这个问题，通过引入预测"运行和"的辅助损失成功实现了多位数乘法学习。

Abstract: Language models are increasingly capable, yet still fail at a seemingly
simple task of multi-digit multiplication. In this work, we study why, by
reverse-engineering a model that successfully learns multiplication via
\emph{implicit chain-of-thought}, and report three findings: (1) Evidence of
long-range structure: Logit attributions and linear probes indicate that the
model encodes the necessary long-range dependencies for multi-digit
multiplication. (2) Mechanism: the model encodes long-range dependencies using
attention to construct a directed acyclic graph to ``cache'' and ``retrieve''
pairwise partial products. (3) Geometry: the model implements partial products
in attention heads by forming Minkowski sums between pairs of digits, and
digits are represented using a Fourier basis, both of which are intuitive and
efficient representations that the standard fine-tuning model lacks. With these
insights, we revisit the learning dynamics of standard fine-tuning and find
that the model converges to a local optimum that lacks the required long-range
dependencies. We further validate this understanding by introducing an
auxiliary loss that predicts the ``running sum'' via a linear regression probe,
which provides an inductive bias that enables the model to successfully learn
multi-digit multiplication. In summary, by reverse-engineering the mechanisms
of an implicit chain-of-thought model we uncover a pitfall for learning
long-range dependencies in Transformers and provide an example of how the
correct inductive bias can address this issue.

TL;DR: PrunedLoRA是一种新的参数高效微调框架，通过结构化剪枝从过参数化初始化中获得高表达性的低秩适配器，在数学推理、代码生成和自然语言理解任务中优于LoRA及其变体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA的表征能力通常落后于全参数微调，关键问题是如何从过参数化空间中获得表达性强的低秩适配器。

Method: 提出PrunedLoRA框架，在微调过程中动态剪枝不重要组件并防止其重新激活，实现灵活的自适应秩分配。采用基于梯度的剪枝策略，最小化整体损失的剪枝误差。

Result: 在数学推理、代码生成和自然语言理解任务中，PrunedLoRA持续优于LoRA及其变体，并在不同稀疏度水平上优于现有结构化剪枝方法。

Conclusion: PrunedLoRA通过结构化剪枝有效提升了低秩适配器的表达能力，提供了首个结构化剪枝鲁棒性理论分析，证明基于梯度的剪枝在权重扰动下比基于激活的剪枝更鲁棒。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely used paradigm for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models, yet its
representational capacity often lags behind full fine-tuning. Within the
context of LoRA, a key open question is how to obtain expressive low-rank
adapters from over-parameterized spaces. We propose \textit{PrunedLoRA}, a new
framework that leverages structured pruning to obtain highly representative
low-rank adapters from an over-parameterized initialization. Unlike prior
approaches that impose a fixed low-rank budget, PrunedLoRA dynamically prunes
less important components during fine-tuning and prevents their reactivation,
enabling flexible and adaptive rank allocation. For structured pruning, by
minimizing the pruning error for overall loss, we provide fine-grained pruning
and recovery updates in a gradient-based pruning strategy with grounded
interpretation. We provide the first theoretical analysis of the robustness of
structured pruning and provably show that under the impact of weight
perturbation, gradient-based pruning is more robust than activation-based
pruning with respect to overall loss. Empirically, PrunedLoRA consistently
outperforms LoRA and its variants across supervised fine-tuning tasks in
mathematical reasoning, code generation, and natural language understanding,
and it also demonstrates advantages over existing structured pruning methods
across diverse sparsity levels.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRPO-λ是GRPO的扩展方法，通过λ-return和资格迹来改进LLM在复杂推理任务中的信用分配，在数学推理数据集上相比GRPO有显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GRPO方法缺乏明确的奖励或评论家模型，限制了其在token序列间进行细粒度信用分配的能力，需要改进RL微调中的信用分配机制。

Method: 提出GRPO-λ方法，使用基于token级对数概率的资格迹重新表述来近似λ-return学习，并引入无评论家的时序差分误差近似，设计了多种λ-return加权变体。

Result: 在1.5B到7B参数的模型上，相比GRPO在RL训练期间性能提升30-40%，在AIME24等数学推理基准上平均性能提升超过3分，7B模型提升4.5分。

Conclusion: GRPO-λ通过改进信用分配机制，显著提升了LLM在复杂推理任务中的RL微调效果，为LLM的推理能力优化提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for tasks requiring
complex reasoning, prompting significant interest in improving their reasoning
abilities through post-training. Especially RL based methods using verifiable
reward, like the state-of-the-art GRPO, have shown to tremendously improve
reasoning behaviors when applied as post-training methods. However, the lack of
an explicit reward or critic model limits GRPO's ability to assign fine-grained
credit across token sequences. In this work, we present GRPO-$\lambda$, a novel
extension to GRPO that enhances credit assignment in RL finetuning of LLMs for
complex reasoning tasks. We approximate learning from $\lambda$-return with a
reformulation of eligibility traces using token-level log-probabilities applied
after each sequence generation, and a novel critic-free approximation of the
temporal-difference error. We introduce a few variations for the weighting of
the $\lambda$-return, and their applications to the eligibility-trace, where
all the variations provide significant gains over GRPO. We compare
GRPO-$\lambda$ against GRPO by training models from 1.5B to 7B parameters on
$4$ different math reasoning datasets. The training plots demonstrate 30-40%
improved performance during RL training on both LLaMA-3.1 and Qwen-2.5
architectures. Finally, we show that with GRPO-$\lambda$, the resulting average
performance on AIME24, Math500, OlympiadMath, MinervaMath, and AMC improves
over GRPO by over $3$ points and a $4.5$ points improvement on the 7B model.

Motivation: 当前LLM生态系统模型多样，没有单一最优模型，路由器选择变得重要但困难，缺乏标准化比较平台。

Method: 构建RouterArena平台，包含：1）知识领域覆盖广泛的数据集；2）各领域可区分难度级别；3）广泛的评估指标；4）自动更新排行榜的框架。

Result: 创建了初始排行榜并进行了详细指标比较，平台即将向公众开放。

Conclusion: RouterArena为LLM路由器提供了首个全面比较平台，解决了路由器选择难题，促进了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Today's LLM ecosystem comprises a wide spectrum of models that differ in
size, capability, and cost. No single model is optimal for all scenarios;
hence, LLM routers have become essential for selecting the most appropriate
model under varying circumstances. However, the rapid emergence of various
routers makes choosing the right one increasingly challenging. To address this
problem, we need a comprehensive router comparison and a standardized
leaderboard, similar to those available for models. In this work, we introduce
RouterArena, the first open platform enabling comprehensive comparison of LLM
routers. RouterArena has (1) a principally constructed dataset with broad
knowledge domain coverage, (2) distinguishable difficulty levels for each
domain, (3) an extensive list of evaluation metrics, and (4) an automated
framework for leaderboard updates. Leveraging our framework, we have produced
the initial leaderboard with detailed metrics comparison as shown in Figure 1.
We will make our platform open to the public soon.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoRAFusion是一个高效的LoRA微调系统，通过图分割融合内存绑定操作和自适应批处理算法，解决了现有LoRA系统的内存访问冗余和多适配器并发微调问题，实现了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LoRA微调系统存在两个关键低效问题：一是由于大型激活张量的冗余内存访问导致运行时开销大；二是无法在相同GPU上并发微调多个共享基础模型的独立LoRA适配器，错失了减少流水线气泡、改善通信重叠和GPU负载平衡等性能增益机会。

Method: LoRAFusion在核级别提出图分割方法融合内存绑定操作，消除不必要的内存访问；在调度级别引入多任务微调的自适应批处理算法，将LoRA适配器分组以错开批次执行，并在组内解决装箱问题生成平衡的、依赖感知的微批次。

Result: LoRAFusion相比Megatron-LM实现了最高1.96倍（平均1.47倍）的端到端加速，相比最先进的多LoRA微调系统mLoRA实现了最高1.46倍（平均1.29倍）的改进。融合核实现了最高1.39倍（平均1.27倍）的核性能提升，可作为现有LoRA系统的即插即用替代方案。

Conclusion: LoRAFusion通过核级和调度级的优化，有效解决了LoRA微调系统的效率瓶颈，显著提升了训练性能，为大规模语言模型的高效微调提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become the leading Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method for Large Language Models (LLMs), as it significantly
reduces GPU memory usage while maintaining competitive fine-tuned model quality
on downstream tasks. Despite these benefits, we identify two key inefficiencies
in existing LoRA fine-tuning systems. First, they incur substantial runtime
overhead due to redundant memory accesses on large activation tensors. Second,
they miss the opportunity to concurrently fine-tune multiple independent LoRA
adapters that share the same base model on the same set of GPUs. This leads to
missed performance gains such as reduced pipeline bubbles, better communication
overlap, and improved GPU load balance.
  To address these issues, we introduce LoRAFusion, an efficient LoRA
fine-tuning system for LLMs. At the kernel level, we propose a graph-splitting
method that fuses memory-bound operations. This design eliminates unnecessary
memory accesses and preserves the performance of compute-bound GEMMs without
incurring the cost of recomputation or synchronization. At the scheduling
level, LoRAFusion introduces an adaptive batching algorithm for multi-job
fine-tuning. It first splits LoRA adapters into groups to intentionally stagger
batch execution across jobs, and then solves a bin-packing problem within each
group to generate balanced, dependency-aware microbatches. LoRAFusion achieves
up to $1.96\times$ ($1.47\times$ on average) end-to-end speedup compared to
Megatron-LM, and up to $1.46\times$ ($1.29\times$ on average) improvement over
mLoRA, the state-of-the-art multi-LoRA fine-tuning system. Our fused kernel
achieves up to $1.39\times$ ($1.27\times$ on average) kernel performance
improvement and can directly serve as a plug-and-play replacement in existing
LoRA systems. We open-source LoRAFusion at

Motivation: MAML在元强化学习中面临二阶梯度计算带来的计算和内存开销大、优化嵌套结构复杂导致收敛困难的问题

Method: 在二阶梯度步骤之前应用额外的任务导向一阶近似来估计二阶梯度效果

Result: 在CartPole-v1、LunarLander-v2和双车交叉路口场景中，Directed-MAML在计算效率和收敛速度上优于MAML基线

Conclusion: 任务导向近似可有效集成到其他元学习算法中，提高计算效率和收敛速度

Abstract: Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) is a versatile meta-learning framework
applicable to both supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL).
However, applying MAML to meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) presents
notable challenges. First, MAML relies on second-order gradient computations,
leading to significant computational and memory overhead. Second, the nested
structure of optimization increases the problem's complexity, making
convergence to a global optimum more challenging. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Directed-MAML, a novel task-directed meta-RL algorithm.
Before the second-order gradient step, Directed-MAML applies an additional
first-order task-directed approximation to estimate the effect of second-order
gradients, thereby accelerating convergence to the optimum and reducing
computational cost. Experimental results demonstrate that Directed-MAML
surpasses MAML-based baselines in computational efficiency and convergence
speed in the scenarios of CartPole-v1, LunarLander-v2 and two-vehicle
intersection crossing. Furthermore, we show that task-directed approximation
can be effectively integrated into other meta-learning algorithms, such as
First-Order Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (FOMAML) and Meta Stochastic Gradient
Descent(Meta-SGD), yielding improved computational efficiency and convergence
speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究KV缓存压缩在多指令提示等现实场景中的实际影响，识别部署压缩LLM时需要注意的陷阱。

Method: 分析不同压缩方法、指令顺序和KV驱逐偏差对提示泄漏的影响，并提出改进的KV缓存驱逐策略。

Result: 发现某些指令在压缩时会快速退化，导致被LLM完全忽略，系统提示泄漏是典型案例。

Conclusion: KV缓存压缩需要谨慎使用，提出的简单驱逐策略改进可以减少多指令任务中的负面影响。

Abstract: KV cache compression promises increased throughput and efficiency with
negligible loss in performance. While the gains in throughput are indisputable
and recent literature has indeed shown minimal degradation on particular
benchmarks, in general the consequences of compression in realistic scenarios
such as multi-instruction prompting have been insufficiently studied. In this
paper, we identify several pitfalls practitioners should be aware of when
deploying KV cache compressed LLMs. Importantly, we show that certain
instructions degrade much more rapidly with compression, effectively causing
them to be completely ignored by the LLM. As a practical example of that, we
highlight system prompt leakage as a case study, empirically showing the impact
of compression on leakage and general instruction following. We show several
factors that play a role in prompt leakage: compression method, instruction
order, and KV eviction bias. We then propose simple changes to KV cache
eviction policies that can reduce the impact of these factors and improve the
overall performance in multi-instruction tasks.

Conclusion: DIANO展示了在潜空间中求解PDE的能力，该潜空间既支持维度降维又支持几何降维，同时允许潜空间可解释性，为科学机器学习提供了新的物理约束潜空间构建方法。

Abstract: Scientific machine learning has enabled the extraction of physical insights
from high-dimensional spatiotemporal flow data using linear and nonlinear
dimensionality reduction techniques. Despite these advances, achieving
interpretability within the latent space remains a challenge. To address this,
we propose the DIfferentiable Autoencoding Neural Operator (DIANO), a
deterministic autoencoding neural operator framework that constructs physically
interpretable latent spaces for both dimensional and geometric reduction, with
the provision to enforce differential governing equations directly within the
latent space. Built upon neural operators, DIANO compresses high-dimensional
input functions into a low-dimensional latent space via spatial coarsening
through an encoding neural operator and subsequently reconstructs the original
inputs using a decoding neural operator through spatial refinement. We assess
DIANO's latent space interpretability and performance in dimensionality
reduction against baseline models, including the Convolutional Neural Operator
and standard autoencoders. Furthermore, a fully differentiable partial
differential equation (PDE) solver is developed and integrated within the
latent space, enabling the temporal advancement of both high- and low-fidelity
PDEs, thereby embedding physical priors into the latent dynamics. We further
investigate various PDE formulations, including the 2D unsteady
advection-diffusion and the 3D Pressure-Poisson equation, to examine their
influence on shaping the latent flow representations. Benchmark problems
considered include flow past a 2D cylinder, flow through a 2D symmetric
stenosed artery, and a 3D patient-specific coronary artery. These case studies
demonstrate DIANO's capability to solve PDEs within a latent space that
facilitates both dimensional and geometrical reduction while allowing latent
interpretability.

TL;DR: 本文展示了在自动微分框架中高效计算梯度统计信息的方法，通过AD图手术和JAX向量化实现，并重新审视了优化中的非线性操作，发现signSGD中sign操作的位置和Adam预处理器中均值主导的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习训练算法将小批量样本视为单一对象，仅计算梯度平均值。作者认为计算更多梯度统计信息在AD框架中并非资源密集型，且能带来新的算法设计可能性。

Method: 通过自动微分图手术实现梯度统计计算，在某些情况下几乎不增加计算和内存开销。对于transformer等模型，使用JAX的向量化变换进行原型实现。

Result: 发现signSGD中sign操作的最佳位置可通过信噪比预测；Adam预处理器中均值主导比方差主导更有利于优化，与传统认知相反。

Conclusion: 逐样本梯度信息为算法设计提供了新的分析和可能性，挑战了优化中非线性操作的传统理解。

Abstract: Training algorithms in deep learning usually treat a mini-batch of samples as
a single object; they average gradients over the mini-batch, and then process
the average in various ways. Computing other statistics beyond the average may
have been seen as prohibitively resource intensive in automatic differentiation
(AD) frameworks. We show that this is not the case. Generally, gradient
statistics can be implemented through a surgery of the AD graph, which, in some
cases, incur almost no computational and memory overheads compared to the
mini-batch gradient computation. Additionally, we show that in certain classes
of models, including transformers, JAX's vectorization transformation offers a
viable implementation for prototyping and experimentation. We then revise our
understanding of two nonlinear operations in optimization through the lens of
per-example gradient transformations. We first study signSGD and show that the
optimal placement of the sign operation in the gradient processing chain is
crucial to success and can be predicted with a simple signal-to-noise ratio
argument. Next we study per-example variations of the Adam preconditioner, and
show that optimization is best served when the preconditioner is dominated by
the mean rather than the variance of the gradient distribution - in contrast to
conventional wisdom. Overall we demonstrate that per-example gradient
information enables new analyses and possibilities for algorithm design.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文挑战了监督微调(SFT)无法泛化而强化学习(RL)泛化能力更强的普遍观点。通过系统评估发现，SFT的泛化失败主要源于固定提示模板的局限性，引入提示多样性和思维链监督可以显著提升SFT的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视关于SFT记忆训练数据而无法泛化、RL具有更强泛化能力的普遍观点，通过实验验证SFT在适当训练策略下的泛化潜力。

Method: 在两个决策基准(Sokoban和General Points)上进行系统评估，引入提示多样性训练和思维链监督作为改进SFT泛化能力的关键方法。

Result: 提示多样性训练使SFT能够泛化到未见过的指令变体，思维链监督显著提升对更难任务的泛化能力，两者结合在指令变体和难度变体设置中均达到或超过RL基线的性能。

Conclusion: SFT并非天生劣于RL，通过适当的数据策展和训练策略，简单的SFT可以实现与RL相当的强泛化能力，这支持了数据中心的视角。

Abstract: A prevailing view holds that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) memorizes training
data and fails to generalize, whereas reinforcement learning (RL) attains
broader robustness. We revisit this claim through a systematic evaluation on
two decision-making benchmarks, Sokoban and General Points, and arrive at a
different conclusion. We show that much of SFT's perceived failure stems from
frozen-prompt artifacts: when trained on fixed instruction templates, SFT
models cling to training semantics rather than adapting to new ones.
Introducing prompt diversity during training breaks this shortcut and yields
strong generalization to unseen instruction variants without harming
in-distribution performance. Beyond instruction shifts, we ask whether SFT can
generalize to strictly harder tasks. Here, chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision
provides an algorithmic scaffold that markedly improves transfer to more
difficult regimes, such as larger Sokoban grids with additional boxes and
arithmetic with out-of-distribution values or five-card compositions that
increase combinatorial complexity. Finally, combining prompt diversity with CoT
achieves the best of both worlds: robust generalization across both
instruction-variant and difficulty-variant settings, matching or surpassing RL
baselines on our benchmarks while retaining SFT's simplicity and stability.
These findings challenge the narrative that SFT is inherently inferior to RL
and support a data-centric perspective: with appropriately curated
demonstrations, vanilla SFT can generalize as strongly as RL. Code reproducing
the results in the paper can be found at:

Motivation: 显微镜技术产生大量复杂图像数据，需要发现更简单、可解释和简约的形式来揭示底层物理结构。VAE虽然能构建低维表示，但其性能严重依赖于多个设计选择，通常需要通过试错和实证分析来优化。

Method: 使用压电力显微镜数据作为模型系统，研究了多种策略和奖励函数。通过高斯混合模型(GMM)和贝叶斯高斯混合模型(BGMM)来近似潜在空间，构建能够估计模型效率的奖励函数。

Conclusion: 基于奖励的策略能够实现VAE工作流程的自动化和无偏优化，GMM和BGMM方法为构建有效的奖励函数提供了可靠基础。

Abstract: Microscopy techniques generate vast amounts of complex image data that in
principle can be used to discover simpler, interpretable, and parsimonious
forms to reveal the underlying physical structures, such as elementary building
blocks in molecular systems or order parameters and phases in crystalline
materials. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) provide a powerful means of
constructing such low-dimensional representations, but their performance
heavily depends on multiple non-myopic design choices, which are often
optimized through trial-and-error and empirical analysis. To enable automated
and unbiased optimization of VAE workflows, we investigated reward-based
strategies for evaluating latent space representations. Using Piezoresponse
Force Microscopy data as a model system, we examined multiple policies and
reward functions that can serve as a foundation for automated optimization. Our
analysis shows that approximating the latent space with Gaussian Mixture Models
(GMM) and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models (BGMM) provides a strong basis for
constructing reward functions capable of estimating model efficiency and
guiding the search for optimal parsimonious representations.

Conclusion: 编码平滑模块是一种有效的正则化机制，能显著提升模型泛化能力和对抗鲁棒性，且计算开销最小。

Abstract: We introduce the coded-smoothing module, which can be seamlessly integrated
into standard training pipelines, both supervised and unsupervised, to
regularize learning and improve generalization with minimal computational
overhead. In addition, it can be incorporated into the inference pipeline to
randomize the model and enhance robustness against adversarial perturbations.
The design of coded-smoothing is inspired by general coded computing, a
paradigm originally developed to mitigate straggler and adversarial failures in
distributed computing by processing linear combinations of the data rather than
the raw inputs. Building on this principle, we adapt coded computing to machine
learning by designing an efficient and effective regularization mechanism that
encourages smoother representations and more generalizable solutions. Extensive
experiments on both supervised and unsupervised tasks demonstrate that
coded-smoothing consistently improves generalization and achieves
state-of-the-art robustness against gradient-based adversarial attacks.

attention-based components, and train them on the combined task to evaluate
whether both capabilities can be preserved. Our results reveal that, in such
hybrids, the Transformer component tends to exploit shortcut solutions, leading
to poor length generalization. We identify this shortcut reliance as a key
obstacle and propose a simple yet effective training strategy -- delaying the
training of the attention layers -- that mitigates this effect and
significantly improves length generalization performance. Our experiments show
that this approach enables hybrid models to achieve near-perfect accuracy
($>90\%$) on hybrid sequences three times longer than those used during
training.

TL;DR: 提出EVaLP方法，用能量模型作为VAE先验，通过变分方法绕过MCMC采样，实现高效生成和减少先验空洞问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VAE生成模糊样本和先验空洞问题，即先验高概率区域在后验中概率低，导致生成质量差

Method: 将先验建模为能量模型，用变分方法处理归一化常数，避免MCMC采样，使用采样器网络近似变分形式，交替优化训练

Result: 相比SOTA基线，在图像生成质量、减少先验空洞和采样效率方面均有改进

Conclusion: EVaLP方法能有效提升VAE生成质量，同时保持高效采样能力

Abstract: Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) are known to generate blurry and
inconsistent samples. One reason for this is the "prior hole" problem. A prior
hole refers to regions that have high probability under the VAE's prior but low
probability under the VAE's posterior. This means that during data generation,
high probability samples from the prior could have low probability under the
posterior, resulting in poor quality data. Ideally, a prior needs to be
flexible enough to match the posterior while retaining the ability to generate
samples fast. Generative models continue to address this tradeoff. This paper
proposes to model the prior as an energy-based model (EBM). While EBMs are
known to offer the flexibility to match posteriors (and also improving the
ELBO), they are traditionally slow in sample generation due to their dependency
on MCMC methods. Our key idea is to bring a variational approach to tackle the
normalization constant in EBMs, thus bypassing the expensive MCMC approaches.
The variational form can be approximated with a sampler network, and we show
that such an approach to training priors can be formulated as an alternating
optimization problem. Moreover, the same sampler reduces to an implicit
variational prior during generation, providing efficient and fast sampling. We
compare our Energy-based Variational Latent Prior (EVaLP) method to multiple
SOTA baselines and show improvements in image generation quality, reduced prior
holes, and better sampling efficiency.

*Trung Hoang Le,Tran Cao Son,Huiping Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SLogic是一个新颖的知识图谱补全框架，通过为逻辑规则分配查询相关的动态分数，利用查询头实体的局部子图信息来评估规则的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有逻辑规则方法通常将规则视为通用的，为每个规则分配固定置信度分数，忽略了查询特定的上下文。这是一个显著限制，因为规则的重要性可能因查询而异。

Method: SLogic框架包含一个评分函数，利用查询头实体为中心的子图信息，动态评估每个规则的重要性。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，通过利用局部子图上下文，SLogic在知识图谱补全任务中持续优于最先进的基线方法，包括基于嵌入和基于规则的方法。

Conclusion: SLogic通过引入查询相关的规则评分机制，显著提升了逻辑规则方法在知识图谱补全中的性能，证明了考虑局部子图上下文的重要性。

Abstract: Logical rule-based methods offer an interpretable approach to knowledge graph
completion by capturing compositional relationships in the form of
human-readable inference rules. However, current approaches typically treat
logical rules as universal, assigning each rule a fixed confidence score that
ignores query-specific context. This is a significant limitation, as a rule's
importance can vary depending on the query. To address this, we introduce
SLogic (Subgraph-Informed Logical Rule learning), a novel framework that
assigns query-dependent scores to logical rules. The core of SLogic is a
scoring function that utilizes the subgraph centered on a query's head entity,
allowing the significance of each rule to be assessed dynamically. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets show that by leveraging local subgraph
context, SLogic consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including
both embedding-based and rule-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型的双向注意力机制虽然能更好捕捉上下文联系，但与KV缓存不兼容，导致推理效率低于自回归模型。现有并行解码方法虽然能加速但会造成性能下降

Method: 提出Freedave算法，采用并行解码的候选生成和验证流程，保证生成与静态采样相同的序列，无需额外模型前向调用

Result: 在数学推理任务上，DLLM的吞吐量可提升至2.8倍，且无性能下降

Conclusion: Freedave算法成功解决了DLLM推理效率问题，实现了无损并行解码，显著提升了模型吞吐量

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have emerged as a new paradigm of
language modeling beyond autoregressive next-token prediction. Thanks to their
bidirectional attention mechanism, DLLMs are more capable of capturing the
connection of context, and thus show unique advantages in challenges like the
famous "reversal curse" or learning under data-constrained scenarios. However,
this bidirectional nature also brings an obstacle that DLLMs are not inherently
compatible with KV Cache, and consequently, the inference efficiency is not
competitive compared with autoregressive models. Taking advantage of their
inherent capability of multi-token prediction, existing parallel decoding
algorithms can speed up the DLLM inference, but at the cost of non-negligible
performance degradation. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Free
Draft-and-Verification (Freedave), a novel fast sampling algorithm tailored for
DLLMs that achieves lossless parallel decoding. Specifically, we propose a
pipeline of parallel-decoded candidate generation and verification, which is
guaranteed to reproduce the same sequence generated by static sampling, without
introducing extra model forward calls. By applying Freedave, the throughput of
DLLMs can be boosted up to $2.8\times$ without performance degradation on math
reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in Large Language Model-generated text is crucial
for their safe deployment. While probing classifiers show promise, they operate
on isolated layer-token pairs and are LLM-specific, limiting their
effectiveness and hindering cross-LLM applications. In this paper, we introduce
a novel approach to address these shortcomings. We build on the natural
sequential structure of activation data in both axes (layers $\times$ tokens)
and advocate treating full activation tensors akin to images. We design
ACT-ViT, a Vision Transformer-inspired model that can be effectively and
efficiently applied to activation tensors and supports training on data from
multiple LLMs simultaneously. Through comprehensive experiments encompassing
diverse LLMs and datasets, we demonstrate that ACT-ViT consistently outperforms
traditional probing techniques while remaining extremely efficient for
deployment. In particular, we show that our architecture benefits substantially
from multi-LLM training, achieves strong zero-shot performance on unseen
datasets, and can be transferred effectively to new LLMs through fine-tuning.

Conclusion: 揭示了泛化与塑性之间的基本张力，提出了架构选择或针对性扰动作为潜在的缓解策略。

Abstract: Deep learning models excel in stationary data but struggle in non-stationary
environments due to a phenomenon known as loss of plasticity (LoP), the
degradation of their ability to learn in the future. This work presents a
first-principles investigation of LoP in gradient-based learning. Grounded in
dynamical systems theory, we formally define LoP by identifying stable
manifolds in the parameter space that trap gradient trajectories. Our analysis
reveals two primary mechanisms that create these traps: frozen units from
activation saturation and cloned-unit manifolds from representational
redundancy. Our framework uncovers a fundamental tension: properties that
promote generalization in static settings, such as low-rank representations and
simplicity biases, directly contribute to LoP in continual learning scenarios.
We validate our theoretical analysis with numerical simulations and explore
architectural choices or targeted perturbations as potential mitigation
strategies.

Motivation: 传统的Lipschitz bandit问题假设奖励能够立即被观察到，但在实际应用中，反馈往往存在随机延迟。本文旨在解决这种延迟反馈对学习性能的影响。

Method: 针对有界延迟，提出了延迟感知的缩放算法；针对无界延迟，设计了新颖的阶段性学习策略，在精心安排的区间内累积可靠反馈。

Result: 在有界延迟下，算法保持了无延迟设置的最优性能，仅增加了与最大延迟相关的额外项；在无界延迟下，算法达到了接近最优的遗憾界（相差对数因子）。实验结果表明算法在各种延迟场景下都表现高效。

Conclusion: 本文成功解决了具有随机延迟反馈的Lipschitz bandit问题，为有界和无界延迟情况分别提供了有效的算法解决方案，并通过理论分析和实验验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: The Lipschitz bandit problem extends stochastic bandits to a continuous
action set defined over a metric space, where the expected reward function
satisfies a Lipschitz condition. In this work, we introduce a new problem of
Lipschitz bandit in the presence of stochastic delayed feedback, where the
rewards are not observed immediately but after a random delay. We consider both
bounded and unbounded stochastic delays, and design algorithms that attain
sublinear regret guarantees in each setting. For bounded delays, we propose a
delay-aware zooming algorithm that retains the optimal performance of the
delay-free setting up to an additional term that scales with the maximal delay
$\tau_{\max}$. For unbounded delays, we propose a novel phased learning
strategy that accumulates reliable feedback over carefully scheduled intervals,
and establish a regret lower bound showing that our method is nearly optimal up
to logarithmic factors. Finally, we present experimental results to demonstrate
the efficiency of our algorithms under various delay scenarios.

Conclusion: 该研究填补了联邦推理鲁棒性分析的空白，提出的方法能够有效提升联邦推理系统在面对攻击时的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Federated inference, in the form of one-shot federated learning, edge
ensembles, or federated ensembles, has emerged as an attractive solution to
combine predictions from multiple models. This paradigm enables each model to
remain local and proprietary while a central server queries them and aggregates
predictions. Yet, the robustness of federated inference has been largely
neglected, leaving them vulnerable to even simple attacks. To address this
critical gap, we formalize the problem of robust federated inference and
provide the first robustness analysis of this class of methods. Our analysis of
averaging-based aggregators shows that the error of the aggregator is small
either when the dissimilarity between honest responses is small or the margin
between the two most probable classes is large. Moving beyond linear averaging,
we show that problem of robust federated inference with non-linear aggregators
can be cast as an adversarial machine learning problem. We then introduce an
advanced technique using the DeepSet aggregation model, proposing a novel
composition of adversarial training and test-time robust aggregation to
robustify non-linear aggregators. Our composition yields significant
improvements, surpassing existing robust aggregation methods by 4.7 - 22.2% in
accuracy points across diverse benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决基于LLM的自动调制分类方法中存在的长提示上下文和大模型规模问题，使其更适合实际部署应用。

Method: 采用离散化高阶统计量和累积量为符号标记，通过轻量级预过滤器精简示例列表，使用理性分析过滤误导特征，并通过校准提示模板强制标签预测。

Result: 在十种调制类型的合成AMC任务中，使用约5B参数的Gemini-2.5-Flash模型达到45.5%准确率，相比7B参数的基线模型5.2%有显著提升，同时减少超过一半的输入输出标记和模型参数。

Conclusion: 精心设计的离散化和上下文选择可以在降低2倍以上推理成本的同时，保持基于提示的AMC优势，实现实用的闭环应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform Automatic Modulation Classification
(AMC) in an open-set manner without LLM fine-tuning when equipped with
carefully designed in-context prompts~\cite{rostami2025plug}. Building on this
prior work, we target the practical bottlenecks of long prompt contexts and
large model sizes that impede in-the-loop deployment. We present Discretized
Statistics in-Context Automatic Modulation Classification (DiSC-AMC), a token-
and parameter-efficient variant that: (i) discretizes higher-order statistics
and cumulants into compact symbolic tokens, (ii) prunes the exemplar list via a
lightweight k-top neural prefilter and filters misleading/low-impact features
using rationales extracted from prior LLM responses, and (iii) enforces
label-only predictions through a calibrated prompt template. Together, these
changes reduce both input/output tokens and the model parameter footprint by
more than half while maintaining competitive accuracy. On synthetic AMC with
ten modulation types under noise, a 7B \textit{DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen}
baseline achieves 5.2% accuracy, whereas our system, using an approximately
5B-parameter \textit{Gemini-2.5-Flash}~\cite{comanici2025gemini} model, attains
45.5% accuracy. These results demonstrate that careful discretization and
context selection can cut inference cost by over 2x while preserving the
advantages of prompt-based AMC and enabling practical in-the-loop use.

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型上，DecepChain实现了高攻击成功率，同时在良性场景下性能下降最小。人类评估显示难以区分被操纵的推理过程与良性推理。

Conclusion: 这种隐蔽的失败模式可能悄悄破坏LLM答案并削弱人类对其推理的信任，强调了未来研究这一警示性风险的紧迫性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been demonstrating increasingly strong
reasoning capability with their chain-of-thoughts (CoT), which are routinely
used by humans to judge answer quality. This reliance creates a powerful yet
fragile basis for trust. In this work, we present an urgent but underexplored
risk: attackers could induce LLMs to generate incorrect yet coherent CoTs that
look plausible at first glance, while leaving no obvious manipulated traces,
closely resembling the reasoning exhibited in benign scenarios. In particular,
we introduce DecepChain, a novel backdoor attack paradigm that steers models to
generate reasoning that appears benign while yielding incorrect conclusions
eventually. At a high level, DecepChain exploits LLMs' own hallucination and
amplifies it by fine-tuning on naturally erroneous rollouts generated by the
model itself and then reinforces it via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) with a flipped reward on triggered inputs, plus a plausibility
regularizer to preserve fluent, benign-looking reasoning. Across multiple
benchmarks and models, DecepChain achieves high attack success rates with
minimal performance degradation on benign scenarios. Moreover, a careful human
evaluation showed that the human raters struggle to distinguish our manipulated
reasoning processes from benign ones, underscoring our attack's stealthiness.
Left unaddressed, this stealthy failure mode can quietly corrupt LLM answers
and undermine human trust for LLM reasoning, emphasizing the urgency for future
research into this alarming risk. Project page: https://decepchain.github.io/.

chapter explores ML applications across three domains namely healthcare,

Conclusion: 跳跃连接并非训练ViT的基本要求，该方法为视觉模型中的层次表示学习开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Transformers have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of
applications, a feat often attributed to their scalability. Yet training them
without skip (residual) connections remains notoriously difficult. While skips
stabilize optimization, they also disrupt the hierarchical structure of
representations, raising the long-standing question of whether transformers can
be trained efficiently without them. In this work, we address this problem by
analyzing the Jacobian of a skipless transformer block, showing why skips
improve conditioning and revealing that their stabilization benefits can be
recovered through a principled initialization strategy. Building on this
insight, we introduce the first method that enables stable and efficient
training of skipless transformers without altering the standard architecture.
We validate our approach on Vision Transformers (ViTs) in both supervised and
self-supervised settings, demonstrating that skipless ViTs trained with our
initialization overcome the usual optimization barriers, learn richer
hierarchical representations, and outperform strong baselines, that incorporate
skip connections, on dense prediction benchmarks. These results show that skip
connections are not a fundamental requirement for training ViTs and open new
avenues for hierarchical representation learning in vision models.

Method: 引入上下文好奇心正则化器，在PPT框架中为DPT添加辅助奖励预测器，使用预测误差作为内在好奇心信号来鼓励训练期间更广泛的探索。

Result: 在高斯多臂老虎机概念验证实验中，PPT显示出更好的鲁棒性，当测试环境奖励方差较高且预训练数据多样性有限时，能够缓解DPT观察到的性能下降。

Conclusion: 虽然离线数据质量仍然至关重要，但初步结果表明好奇心驱动的预训练为增强上下文强化学习智能体的分布外泛化能力提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, there is
increasing interest in incorporating them into decision-making tasks. A common
pipeline for this is Decision-Pretrained Transformers (DPTs). However, existing
training methods for DPTs often struggle to generalize beyond their pretraining
data distribution. To explore mitigation of this limitation, we propose
in-context curiosity -- a lightweight, exploration-inspired regularizer for
offline pretraining -- and introduce the Prediction-Powered Transformer (PPT)
framework. PPT augments DPT with an auxiliary reward predictor, using
prediction error as an intrinsic curiosity signal to encourage broader
exploration during training. In proof-of-concept experiments on Gaussian
multi-armed bandits, PPT shows improved robustness: it moderates the
performance degradation observed in DPT when test environments exhibit higher
variance in reward, particularly when pretraining data has limited diversity.
While the quality of offline data remain fundamental, our preliminary results
suggest that curiosity-driven pretraining offers a promising direction for
enhancing out-of-distribution generalization in in-context RL agents.

Conclusion: 该研究为CMDPs中初始分布变化的影响提供了理论分析框架，有助于理解策略性能对初始分布变化的敏感性。

Abstract: Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) are notably more complex to
solve than standard MDPs due to the absence of universally optimal policies
across all initial state distributions. This necessitates re-solving the CMDP
whenever the initial distribution changes. In this work, we analyze how the
optimal value of CMDPs varies with different initial distributions, deriving
bounds on these variations using duality analysis of CMDPs and perturbation
analysis in linear programming. Moreover, we show how such bounds can be used
to analyze the regret of a given policy due to unknown variations of the
initial distribution.

Motivation: 当前蛋白质结构分词方法依赖定制组件，难以优化和扩展。Kanzi旨在简化蛋白质结构分词过程，用更简单的方法替代复杂的表示和损失函数。

Method: 使用扩散自编码器训练流匹配损失，用全局坐标替代基于框架的表示，用标准注意力替代SE(3)-不变注意力操作，简化了训练过程。

Result: Kanzi在重建指标上优于现有分词器，模型尺寸和训练成本仅为几分之一。自回归模型在生成任务上优于基于token的模型，但尚未达到最先进连续扩散模型的性能。

Conclusion: 流匹配方法简化了蛋白质结构分词器的训练，实现了参数效率更高的模型，为多模态蛋白质建模提供了更简单有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Protein structure tokenizers enable the creation of multimodal models of
protein structure, sequence, and function. Current approaches to protein
structure tokenization rely on bespoke components that are invariant to spatial
symmetries, but that are challenging to optimize and scale. We present Kanzi, a
flow-based tokenizer for tokenization and generation of protein structures.
Kanzi consists of a diffusion autoencoder trained with a flow matching loss. We
show that this approach simplifies several aspects of protein structure
tokenizers: frame-based representations can be replaced with global
coordinates, complex losses are replaced with a single flow matching loss, and
SE(3)-invariant attention operations can be replaced with standard attention.
We find that these changes stabilize the training of parameter-efficient models
that outperform existing tokenizers on reconstruction metrics at a fraction of
the model size and training cost. An autoregressive model trained with Kanzi
outperforms similar generative models that operate over tokens, although it
does not yet match the performance of state-of-the-art continuous diffusion
models. Code is available here: https://github.com/rdilip/kanzi/.

TL;DR: AReUReDi是一种离散优化算法，通过结合Tchebycheff标量化、局部平衡提议和退火Metropolis-Hastings更新，在多目标生物分子序列设计中实现帕累托最优性保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成框架主要在连续空间中运行且仅支持单目标指导，而离散方法缺乏多目标帕累托最优性保证，需要开发能够在离散空间中同时优化多个冲突目标的方法。

Method: 基于Rectified Discrete Flows (ReDi)，结合Tchebycheff标量化、局部平衡提议和退火Metropolis-Hastings更新，在保持分布不变性的同时偏向帕累托最优状态采样。

Result: 在肽和SMILES序列设计中，AReUReDi同时优化多达五个治疗特性（亲和力、溶解度、溶血性、半衰期和非污染性），并优于进化和基于扩散的基线方法。

Conclusion: AReUReDi建立了一个强大的基于序列的多特性生物分子生成框架，具有理论保证的帕累托最优性。

Abstract: Designing sequences that satisfy multiple, often conflicting, objectives is a
central challenge in therapeutic and biomolecular engineering. Existing
generative frameworks largely operate in continuous spaces with
single-objective guidance, while discrete approaches lack guarantees for
multi-objective Pareto optimality. We introduce AReUReDi (Annealed Rectified
Updates for Refining Discrete Flows), a discrete optimization algorithm with
theoretical guarantees of convergence to the Pareto front. Building on
Rectified Discrete Flows (ReDi), AReUReDi combines Tchebycheff scalarization,
locally balanced proposals, and annealed Metropolis-Hastings updates to bias
sampling toward Pareto-optimal states while preserving distributional
invariance. Applied to peptide and SMILES sequence design, AReUReDi
simultaneously optimizes up to five therapeutic properties (including affinity,
solubility, hemolysis, half-life, and non-fouling) and outperforms both
evolutionary and diffusion-based baselines. These results establish AReUReDi as
a powerful, sequence-based framework for multi-property biomolecule generation.

*Gautham Bekal,Ashish Pujari,Scott David Kelly*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出仅查询注意力机制，在持续学习中通过简化Transformer架构，有效缓解塑性损失和灾难性遗忘，性能优于选择性重初始化等基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习面临数据分布漂移的挑战，传统Transformer架构在持续学习场景中容易出现塑性损失和灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: 采用仅查询注意力机制，丢弃键和值，但保留Transformer的核心归纳偏置，将其与模型无关元学习建立概念联系。

Result: 在持续学习场景中，简化后的注意力机制显著缓解了塑性损失和灾难性遗忘，性能优于基线方法，并通过Hessian谱分析发现保持较高曲率秩的模型更易保持塑性。

Conclusion: 完整注意力对于在持续学习中获取元学习益处可能并非必需，简化架构同样有效。

Abstract: Continual learning involves learning from a stream of data without repetition
of data points, a scenario that is inherently complex due to distributional
shift across tasks. We propose a query-only attention mechanism that discards
keys and values, yet preserves the core inductive bias of transformer
architectures. In continual learning scenarios, this simplified mechanism
significantly mitigates both loss of plasticity and catastrophic forgetting,
outperforming baselines such as selective re-initialization. We establish a
conceptual link between query-only attention, full transformer attention, and
model agnostic meta-learning, framing them as instances of meta-learning. We
further provide intuition for why query-based models and attention networks
help preserve plasticity in continual settings. Finally, through preliminary
Hessian spectrum analysis, we observe that models maintaining higher curvature
rank across tasks tend to retain plasticity. Our findings suggest that full
attention may not be essential for capturing the benefits of meta-learning in
continual learning.

Conclusion: GDLNN是一种高效且可解释的图分类方法，在保持高准确性的同时提供高质量的解释能力，且总体成本较低。

Abstract: We present GDLNN, a new graph machine learning architecture, for graph
classification tasks. GDLNN combines a domain-specific programming language,
called GDL, with neural networks. The main strength of GDLNN lies in its GDL
layer, which generates expressive and interpretable graph representations.
Since the graph representation is interpretable, existing model explanation
techniques can be directly applied to explain GDLNN's predictions. Our
evaluation shows that the GDL-based representation achieves high accuracy on
most graph classification benchmark datasets, outperforming dominant graph
learning methods such as GNNs. Applying an existing model explanation technique
also yields high-quality explanations of GDLNN's predictions. Furthermore, the
cost of GDLNN is low when the explanation cost is included.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 验证了一种贝叶斯双轴主动分类方法，用于工作记忆重建任务，通过高斯过程分类器控制空间负载和特征绑定负载，与传统自适应阶梯方法效果相当但能更快收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数认知实验仍控制单一因素并用标量总结性能，需要开发能同时控制多个因素并输出多维性能表面的方法。

Method: 使用贝叶斯高斯过程概率分类器，在虚拟环境中进行5×5工作记忆重建任务，主动控制空间负载L和特征绑定负载K两个变量，基于后验不确定性指导刺激获取。

Result: 与传统自适应阶梯方法在K=3时具有相当效果（组内相关系数0.755），能揭示空间负载与特征绑定的个体差异，仅需约30个样本即可准确拟合完整模型。

Conclusion: 双轴自适应方法能有效估计多维认知性能表面，收敛速度快于其他采样策略，为认知评估提供了更丰富的信息维度。

Abstract: While adaptive experimental design has outgrown one-dimensional,
staircase-based adaptations, most cognitive experiments still control a single
factor and summarize performance with a scalar. We show a validation of a
Bayesian, two-axis, active-classification approach, carried out in an immersive
virtual testing environment for a 5-by-5 working-memory reconstruction task.
Two variables are controlled: spatial load L (number of occupied tiles) and
feature-binding load K (number of distinct colors) of items. Stimulus
acquisition is guided by posterior uncertainty of a nonparametric Gaussian
Process (GP) probabilistic classifier, which outputs a surface over (L, K)
rather than a single threshold or max span value. In a young adult population,
we compare GP-driven Adaptive Mode (AM) with a traditional adaptive staircase
Classic Mode (CM), which varies L only at K = 3. Parity between the methods is
achieved for this cohort, with an intraclass coefficient of 0.755 at K = 3.
Additionally, AM reveals individual differences in interactions between spatial
load and feature binding. AM estimates converge more quickly than other
sampling strategies, demonstrating that only about 30 samples are required for
accurate fitting of the full model.

Motivation: 现有混合模型架构设计依赖人工探索，由于设计空间大和训练成本高，难以发现适合预训练的关键计算原语组合。

Method: 开发模块化混合模型架构搜索框架Composer，在小规模探索架构，通过提出的扩展策略将性能最优架构扩展到更大规模。

Result: 发现的新混合LLM架构在350M-3B参数规模下验证损失持续降低，下游任务准确率提升1.1-3.1%（平均），最高达8.3%，同时提升训练和推理效率。

Conclusion: Composer框架能够有效发现优于现有Transformer架构的混合模型设计，为模型架构探索提供了系统化方法。

Abstract: Hybrid model architectures that combine computational primitives (e.g.,
Attention, MLP) in different ratios have shown promising performance beyond
Transformers. Some studies have shown that different interleavings of
primitives can affect model quality as well. However, prior works explore the
hybrid model architecture design space manually. Due to the large design space
and training costs, discovering hybrid models that combine key computational
primitives for pre-training is challenging. In this work, we take a principled
approach in designing a modular hybrid model architecture search framework --
Composer. Composer explores model architectures at a small scale and
extrapolates the top-performing model architectures to a larger scale using our
proposed scaling strategies. Using Composer, we discover new hybrid LLM
architectures that outperform Llama 3.2. Compared to Llama 3.2 and previous
state-of-the-art baselines, the new model architectures consistently reduce
validation loss at parameter scales of 350M-3B and improve evaluation accuracy
on the downstream tasks by up to 2.8-8.3% (1.1-3.1% on average) while improving
both training and inference efficiency.

Method: 提出了一种概念简单的方法来高效学习概率张量网络，该方法具有数值稳定性。

Result: 在MNIST数据集上实现了10倍延迟减少，在多种密度估计基准测试中能够学习比之前方法多10倍变量的分布。

Conclusion: 该方法为概率张量网络学习提供了一种高效且数值稳定的解决方案，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Tensor networks (TNs) enable compact representations of large tensors through
shared parameters. Their use in probabilistic modeling is particularly
appealing, as probabilistic tensor networks (PTNs) allow for tractable
computation of marginals. However, existing approaches for learning parameters
of PTNs are either computationally demanding and not fully compatible with
automatic differentiation frameworks, or numerically unstable. In this work, we
propose a conceptually simple approach for learning PTNs efficiently, that is
numerically stable. We show our method provides significant improvements in
time and space complexity, achieving 10x reduction in latency for generative
modeling on the MNIST dataset. Furthermore, our approach enables learning of
distributions with 10x more variables than previous approaches when applied to
a variety of density estimation benchmarks. Our code is publicly available at

<details>

Motivation: 需要从噪声和不规则采样的轨迹中学习物理一致的连续时间动力学，同时估计哈密顿量的不确定性。

Method: 在哈密顿量表面上放置高斯过程先验，并将可变步长多步积分器约束编码为有限线性泛函，实现向量场和哈密顿量表面的闭式条件化。

Result: 在质量-弹簧、Van der Pol和Duffing基准测试中展示了改进的向量场恢复和良好校准的哈密顿量不确定性。

Conclusion: MS-PHS GP能够在不使用隐状态的情况下学习物理一致的动力学，并通过设计强制能量平衡和被动性，同时提供哈密顿量的不确定性估计。

Abstract: We propose the multistep port-Hamiltonian Gaussian process (MS-PHS GP) to
learn physically consistent continuous-time dynamics and a posterior over the
Hamiltonian from noisy, irregularly-sampled trajectories. By placing a GP prior
on the Hamiltonian surface $H$ and encoding variable-step multistep integrator
constraints as finite linear functionals, MS-PHS GP enables closed-form
conditioning of both the vector field and the Hamiltonian surface without
latent states, while enforcing energy balance and passivity by design. We state
a finite-sample vector-field bound that separates the estimation and
variable-step discretization terms. Lastly, we demonstrate improved
vector-field recovery and well-calibrated Hamiltonian uncertainty on
mass-spring, Van der Pol, and Duffing benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的数据选择方法，通过反转训练和验证集的角色来识别对目标分布最有用的训练样本，在指令调优和命名实体识别任务中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择方法将目标样本作为验证集，通过逐个添加或移除训练样本来估计效果，这种方法计算量大且效率低。

Method: 反转训练和验证集的角色：在验证集上微调前后对训练池进行推理，选择预测变化最大的样本作为最有用的训练数据。

Result: 在大多数情况下，该方法在指令调优和命名实体识别任务中实现了比现有方法更低的测试对数损失。

Conclusion: 通过反转训练和验证集的角色，可以更简单快速地识别对目标分布最有用的训练样本，该方法得到了理论分析的支持。

Abstract: State-of-the-art machine learning often follows a two-stage process:
$(i)$~pre-training on large, general-purpose datasets; $(ii)$~fine-tuning on
task-specific data. In fine-tuning, selecting training examples that closely
reflect the target distribution is crucial. However, it is often the case that
only a few samples are available from the target distribution. Existing data
selection methods treat these target samples as a validation set and estimate
the effect of adding or removing a single sample from the training pool by
performing inference on the validation set.
  We propose a simpler and faster alternative that inverts the usual role of
train and validation: we perform inference on the training pool before and
after fine-tuning on the validation set. We then select samples whose
predictions change the most. Our key insight is that the training samples most
affected by fine-tuning on a small validation set tend to be the most
beneficial for reducing test loss on the target distribution. Experiments on
instruction tuning and named entity recognition tasks show that, in most cases,
our method achieves lower test log-loss than state-of-the-art approaches. We
support our findings with theoretical analysis.

Motivation: 现有神经网络方法在图相似度计算中要么需要昂贵的节点对比较，要么未能有效利用图的结构和规模信息，需要更高效准确的方法。

Method: G2R将节点表示为封闭区域，在嵌入空间中恢复图的邻接模式，通过区域形状捕获图结构，体积反映图大小，用区域重叠近似MCS，不相交部分代理GED。

Result: 在MCS相似度学习中相对准确率提升达60.0%，同时在训练和推理中保持高效，能够同时预测MCS和GED相似度。

Conclusion: G2R在图相似度计算中表现出色，提供对图相似度的全面评估，是解决NP-Hard图相似度计算问题的有效方法。

Abstract: Graph similarity is critical in graph-related tasks such as graph retrieval,
where metrics like maximum common subgraph (MCS) and graph edit distance (GED)
are commonly used. However, exact computations of these metrics are known to be
NP-Hard. Recent neural network-based approaches approximate the similarity
score in embedding spaces to alleviate the computational burden, but they
either involve expensive pairwise node comparisons or fail to effectively
utilize structural and scale information of graphs. To tackle these issues, we
propose a novel geometric-based graph embedding method called Graph2Region
(G2R). G2R represents nodes as closed regions and recovers their adjacency
patterns within graphs in the embedding space. By incorporating the node
features and adjacency patterns of graphs, G2R summarizes graph regions, i.e.,
graph embeddings, where the shape captures the underlying graph structures and
the volume reflects the graph size. Consequently, the overlap between graph
regions can serve as an approximation of MCS, signifying similar node regions
and adjacency patterns. We further analyze the relationship between MCS and GED
and propose using disjoint parts as a proxy for GED similarity. This analysis
enables concurrent computation of MCS and GED, incorporating local and global
structural information. Experimental evaluation highlights G2R's competitive
performance in graph similarity computation. It achieves up to a 60.0\%
relative accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods in MCS similarity
learning, while maintaining efficiency in both training and inference.
Moreover, G2R showcases remarkable capability in predicting both MCS and GED
similarities simultaneously, providing a holistic assessment of graph
similarity. Code available at https://github.com/liuzhouyang/Graph2Region.

TL;DR: 本文首次对单层Mamba模型的训练动态和上下文学习泛化能力进行了理论分析，证明Mamba通过线性注意力层选择信息性上下文示例，并通过非线性门控层抑制异常值影响，在异常值比例超过线性Transformer容忍阈值时仍能保持准确预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba模型在计算效率上优于Transformer模型，并在多种语言任务中表现相当，具有上下文学习能力。但由于其门控机制引入的非线性，对其理论理解仍有限，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 分析单层Mamba模型的训练动态，该模型包含线性注意力组件和非线性门控层，研究其在包含加性异常值的提示下对未见二元分类任务的上下文学习泛化能力。

Result: Mamba利用线性注意力层选择信息性上下文示例，使用非线性门控层抑制异常值影响。虽然可能需要更多训练迭代收敛，但在异常值比例超过线性Transformer容忍阈值时仍能保持准确预测。

Conclusion: Mamba模型在异常值处理方面优于线性Transformer，理论分析得到实证实验支持，为理解Mamba的上下文学习机制提供了理论基础。

Abstract: The Mamba model has gained significant attention for its computational
advantages over Transformer-based models, while achieving comparable
performance across a wide range of language tasks. Like Transformers, Mamba
exhibits in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, i.e., making predictions for
new tasks based on a prompt containing input-label pairs and a query, without
requiring fine-tuning. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical
understanding of Mamba remains limited, largely due to the nonlinearity
introduced by its gating mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, this paper
presents the first theoretical analysis of the training dynamics of a one-layer
Mamba model, which consists of a linear attention component followed by a
nonlinear gating layer, and its ICL generalization on unseen binary
classification tasks, even when the prompt includes additive outliers. Our
analysis shows that Mamba leverages the linear attention layer to select
informative context examples and uses the nonlinear gating layer to suppress
the influence of outliers. By establishing and comparing to the analysis of
linear Transformers under the same setting, we show that although Mamba may
require more training iterations to converge, it maintains accurate predictions
even when the proportion of outliers exceeds the threshold that a linear
Transformer can tolerate. These theoretical findings are supported by empirical
experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NC-Iso是一种新颖的图神经网络架构，通过构建节点根子树内相邻层级间的层次依赖关系来保留特征相对位置，解决了现有方法中尺度差异和包含约束被破坏的问题，并引入相似性支配比增强度量来提升匹配图对的排序能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于GNN的子图匹配方法存在两个主要问题：1) 在编码过程中忽略了特征在节点根子树内的相对位置，导致包含约束被破坏和错误预测；2) 铰链距离度量对匹配图对缺乏区分能力，限制了排序应用。

Method: 提出NC-Iso架构，通过构建节点根子树内相邻层级间的层次依赖关系来保留特征相对位置，确保匹配图对在特征计数上保持一致的层次结构。同时引入相似性支配比增强度量，量化图对间相似性相对于不相似性的支配程度。

Result: 在九个数据集上的实证结果表明，NC-Iso在保持时间效率的同时，验证了其有效性、泛化能力、可扩展性和可迁移性，为子图检索提供了更具区分度的神经子图匹配解决方案。

Conclusion: NC-Iso通过保留特征相对位置和引入新的相似性度量，解决了现有神经子图匹配方法的局限性，提供了更准确和具有区分度的子图匹配解决方案。

Abstract: Subgraph matching is challenging as it necessitates time-consuming
combinatorial searches. Recent Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approaches
address this issue by employing GNN encoders to extract graph information and
hinge distance measures to ensure containment constraints in the embedding
space. These methods significantly shorten the response time, making them
promising solutions for subgraph retrieval. However, they suffer from scale
differences between graph pairs during encoding, as they focus on feature
counts but overlook the relative positions of features within node-rooted
subtrees, leading to disturbed containment constraints and false predictions.
Additionally, their hinge distance measures lack discriminative power for
matched graph pairs, hindering ranking applications. We propose NC-Iso, a novel
GNN architecture for neural subgraph matching. NC-Iso preserves the relative
positions of features by building the hierarchical dependencies between
adjacent echelons within node-rooted subtrees, ensuring matched graph pairs
maintain consistent hierarchies while complying with containment constraints in
feature counts. To enhance the ranking ability for matched pairs, we introduce
a novel similarity dominance ratio-enhanced measure, which quantifies the
dominance of similarity over dissimilarity between graph pairs. Empirical
results on nine datasets validate the effectiveness, generalization ability,
scalability, and transferability of NC-Iso while maintaining time efficiency,
offering a more discriminative neural subgraph matching solution for subgraph
retrieval. Code available at https://github.com/liuzhouyang/NC-Iso.

TL;DR: 提出了一个从字典学习推导稀疏自编码器的理论框架，揭示了现有SAE变体的局限性，并提出了AbsTopK SAE来改进双向概念表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏自编码器缺乏理论推导框架，且其正则化器强制非负性，阻碍了单个特征表示双向概念的能力。

Method: 通过展开稀疏编码的近端梯度方法，推导出常见SAE变体，并提出基于ℓ0稀疏约束的AbsTopK SAE，通过保留正负激活来支持双向概念表示。

Result: 在四个LLM和七个任务上的实验表明，AbsTopK提高了重建保真度、增强了解释性，并使单个特征能够编码对比概念，性能匹配甚至超过需要标注数据的监督方法。

Conclusion: AbsTopK SAE通过保留双向激活解决了现有SAE的局限性，提供了更丰富、更完整的语义表示能力。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as powerful techniques for
interpretability of large language models (LLMs), aiming to decompose hidden
states into meaningful semantic features. While several SAE variants have been
proposed, there remains no principled framework to derive SAEs from the
original dictionary learning formulation. In this work, we introduce such a
framework by unrolling the proximal gradient method for sparse coding. We show
that a single-step update naturally recovers common SAE variants, including
ReLU, JumpReLU, and TopK. Through this lens, we reveal a fundamental limitation
of existing SAEs: their sparsity-inducing regularizers enforce non-negativity,
preventing a single feature from representing bidirectional concepts (e.g.,
male vs. female). This structural constraint fragments semantic axes into
separate, redundant features, limiting representational completeness. To
address this issue, we propose AbsTopK SAE, a new variant derived from the
$\ell_0$ sparsity constraint that applies hard thresholding over the
largest-magnitude activations. By preserving both positive and negative
activations, AbsTopK uncovers richer, bidirectional conceptual representations.
Comprehensive experiments across four LLMs and seven probing and steering tasks
show that AbsTopK improves reconstruction fidelity, enhances interpretability,
and enables single features to encode contrasting concepts. Remarkably, AbsTopK
matches or even surpasses the Difference-in-Mean method, a supervised approach
that requires labeled data for each concept and has been shown in prior work to
outperform SAEs.

Conclusion: ZO Fine-tuner展示了强大的性能和可扩展性，为高效LLM微调提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimizers have recently emerged as a practical approach for
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), significantly reducing GPU memory
consumption compared to traditional first-order methods. Yet, existing
zeroth-order methods rely on hand-crafted, static sampling strategies that are
not adaptable to model-specific structures. To address this, we propose ZO
Fine-tuner, a learning-based zeroth-order optimizer for LLMs that automatically
learns efficient perturbation strategies through a compact and memory-efficient
design. Crucially, our approach is motivated by the observation that only a
small number of foundation models and their derivatives are widely adopted in
practice. Therefore, learning the optimizer once for a given LLM and reusing it
across diverse downstream tasks is both feasible and highly desirable.
Accordingly, ZO Fine-tuner is designed to scale learning to learn (L2L) to the
foundation-model era by supporting one-time training per LLM with minimal
overhead. Experiments on 4 LLMs and 7 datasets show that ZO Fine-tuner
outperforms prior zeroth-order baselines in 82.1\% of task-model combinations,
thereby demonstrating strong performance and scalability for efficient LLM
fine-tuning. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 提出的C-SRRG方法通过全面整合临床上下文有效改进了结构化放射学报告生成，公开了数据集、代码和检查点以促进临床对齐的自动化报告生成研究。

Abstract: Automated structured radiology report generation (SRRG) from chest X-ray
images offers significant potential to reduce workload of radiologists by
generating reports in structured formats that ensure clarity, consistency, and
adherence to clinical reporting standards. While radiologists effectively
utilize available clinical contexts in their diagnostic reasoning, existing
SRRG systems overlook these essential elements. This fundamental gap leads to
critical problems including temporal hallucinations when referencing
non-existent clinical contexts. To address these limitations, we propose
contextualized SRRG (C-SRRG) that comprehensively incorporates rich clinical
context for SRRG. We curate C-SRRG dataset by integrating comprehensive
clinical context encompassing 1) multi-view X-ray images, 2) clinical
indication, 3) imaging techniques, and 4) prior studies with corresponding
comparisons based on patient histories. Through extensive benchmarking with
state-of-the-art multimodal large language models, we demonstrate that
incorporating clinical context with the proposed C-SRRG significantly improves
report generation quality. We publicly release dataset, code, and checkpoints
to facilitate future research for clinically-aligned automated RRG at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PromptLoop是一个基于强化学习的即插即用框架，通过多模态大语言模型在扩散模型采样过程中逐步优化提示词，实现有效的奖励优化和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于强化学习的扩散模型微调方法在泛化性、组合性和抗奖励攻击鲁棒性方面存在不足，而现有的提示词优化方法多为前馈式，未能充分利用强化学习的序列特性。

Method: 训练多模态大语言模型使用强化学习，基于扩散模型的中间潜在状态迭代更新提示词，而不是直接修改扩散模型权重。

Result: 在多种奖励函数和扩散模型骨干上的实验表明，PromptLoop能有效优化奖励、无缝泛化到未见模型、与现有对齐方法正交组合，并减轻过优化和奖励攻击问题。

Conclusion: PromptLoop通过将潜在反馈融入逐步提示词优化，实现了与Diffusion RL类似的结构类比，同时保持了基于提示词对齐的灵活性和通用性。

Abstract: Despite the recent progress, reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning of
diffusion models often struggles with generalization, composability, and
robustness against reward hacking. Recent studies have explored prompt
refinement as a modular alternative, but most adopt a feed-forward approach
that applies a single refined prompt throughout the entire sampling trajectory,
thereby failing to fully leverage the sequential nature of reinforcement
learning. To address this, here we introduce PromptLoop, a plug-and-play RL
framework that incorporates latent feedback into step-wise prompt refinement.
Rather than modifying diffusion model weights, a multimodal large language
model (MLLM) is trained with RL to iteratively update prompts based on
intermediate latent states of diffusion models. This design achieves a
structural analogy to the Diffusion RL approach, while retaining the
flexibility and generality of prompt-based alignment. Extensive experiments
across diverse reward functions and diffusion backbones demonstrate that
PromptLoop (i) achieves effective reward optimization, (ii) generalizes
seamlessly to unseen models, (iii) composes orthogonally with existing
alignment methods, and (iv) mitigates over-optimization and reward hacking.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出SADA方法，根据样本对模型优化的动态影响自适应调整数据增强强度，解决传统固定或随机增强方法在动态训练环境中的不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据增强方法采用固定或随机变换，但样本难度会随模型泛化能力动态变化，导致增强数据与模型训练需求不匹配，降低训练效果。

Method: SADA通过将样本梯度投影到累计模型更新方向并计算局部训练窗口内的时间方差，动态调整增强强度：低方差样本增强更强以强调多样性，不稳定样本采用温和变换以保持语义保真度。

Result: 在多种基准数据集和模型架构上的实验显示SADA带来一致改进，细粒度任务提升7.3%，长尾数据集提升4.3%。

Conclusion: SADA是一种轻量级、即插即用的方法，无需辅助模型或策略调优，能有效提升训练效果和实用性。

Abstract: Data augmentation has been widely employed to improve the generalization of
deep neural networks. Most existing methods apply fixed or random
transformations. However, we find that sample difficulty evolves along with the
model's generalization capabilities in dynamic training environments. As a
result, applying uniform or stochastic augmentations, without accounting for
such dynamics, can lead to a mismatch between augmented data and the model's
evolving training needs, ultimately degrading training effectiveness. To
address this, we introduce SADA, a Sample-Aware Dynamic Augmentation that
performs on-the-fly adjustment of augmentation strengths based on each sample's
evolving influence on model optimization. Specifically, we estimate each
sample's influence by projecting its gradient onto the accumulated model update
direction and computing the temporal variance within a local training window.
Samples with low variance, indicating stable and consistent influence, are
augmented more strongly to emphasize diversity, while unstable samples receive
milder transformations to preserve semantic fidelity and stabilize learning.
Our method is lightweight, which does not require auxiliary models or policy
tuning. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing training pipelines as a
plug-and-play module. Experiments across various benchmark datasets and model
architectures show consistent improvements of SADA, including +7.3\% on
fine-grained tasks and +4.3\% on long-tailed datasets, highlighting the
method's effectiveness and practicality.

Motivation: 神经网络训练中存储层激活的内存需求带来了显著的可扩展性挑战，需要开发内存高效的梯度计算方法。

Method: 采用控制理论中的矩阵素描框架，使用三个互补的素描矩阵通过指数移动平均维护，并自适应调整秩以平衡内存效率和近似质量。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和物理信息神经网络上的实证评估展示了可控的精度-内存权衡，并在MNIST上实现了实时梯度范数跟踪。

Conclusion: 素描激活存储为内存高效的神经网络训练和分析提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Neural network training relies on gradient computation through
backpropagation, yet memory requirements for storing layer activations present
significant scalability challenges. We present the first adaptation of
control-theoretic matrix sketching to neural network layer activations,
enabling memory-efficient gradient reconstruction in backpropagation. This work
builds on recent matrix sketching frameworks for dynamic optimization problems,
where similar state trajectory storage challenges motivate sketching
techniques. Our approach sketches layer activations using three complementary
sketch matrices maintained through exponential moving averages (EMA) with
adaptive rank adjustment, automatically balancing memory efficiency against
approximation quality. Empirical evaluation on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and
physics-informed neural networks demonstrates a controllable accuracy-memory
tradeoff. We demonstrate a gradient monitoring application on MNIST showing how
sketched activations enable real-time gradient norm tracking with minimal
memory overhead. These results establish that sketched activation storage
provides a viable path toward memory-efficient neural network training and
analysis.

Conclusion: 该数据集为时空微气候建模提供了首个高分辨率基准，方法可扩展到更广泛的城市异质动态计算任务。

Abstract: With rapid urbanization, predicting urban microclimates has become critical,
as it affects building energy demand and public health risks. However, existing
generative and homogeneous graph approaches fall short in capturing physical
consistency, spatial dependencies, and temporal variability. To address this,
we introduce UrbanGraph, a physics-informed framework integrating heterogeneous
and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs. It encodes key physical processes --
vegetation evapotranspiration, shading, and convective diffusion -- while
modeling complex spatial dependencies among diverse urban entities and their
temporal evolution. We evaluate UrbanGraph on UMC4/12, a physics-based
simulation dataset covering diverse urban configurations and climates. Results
show that UrbanGraph improves $R^2$ by up to 10.8% and reduces FLOPs by 17.0%
over all baselines, with heterogeneous and dynamic graphs contributing 3.5% and
7.1% gains. Our dataset provides the first high-resolution benchmark for
spatio-temporal microclimate modeling, and our method extends to broader urban
heterogeneous dynamic computing tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理时空数据中的异常检测问题，同时考虑异常的稀疏性和时空平滑性，并提供统计置信度。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in spatiotemporal data is a challenging problem encountered
in a variety of applications, including video surveillance, medical imaging
data, and urban traffic monitoring. Existing anomaly detection methods focus
mainly on point anomalies and cannot deal with temporal and spatial
dependencies that arise in spatio-temporal data. Tensor-based anomaly detection
methods have been proposed to address this problem. Although existing methods
can capture dependencies across different modes, they are primarily supervised
and do not account for the specific structure of anomalies. Moreover, these
methods focus mainly on extracting anomalous features without providing any
statistical confidence. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised
tensor-based anomaly detection method that simultaneously considers the sparse
and spatiotemporally smooth nature of anomalies. The anomaly detection problem
is formulated as a regularized robust low-rank + sparse tensor decomposition
where the total variation of the tensor with respect to the underlying spatial
and temporal graphs quantifies the spatiotemporal smoothness of the anomalies.
Once the anomalous features are extracted, we introduce a statistical anomaly
scoring framework that accounts for local spatio-temporal dependencies. The
proposed framework is evaluated on both synthetic and real data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TimeEmb是一个轻量级的静态-动态分解框架，用于解决时间序列预测中的时间非平稳性问题。它通过分离时间不变和时间变化分量来提升面对分布偏移时的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列分布随时间变化（时间非平稳性）给可靠预测带来挑战。现有方法往往混淆时间变化和时间不变分量，导致在分布偏移时性能不佳。

Method: 提出静态-动态分解框架：1) 时间不变分量通过全局嵌入模块学习跨时间序列的持久表示；2) 时间变化分量通过频域滤波机制处理，灵感来自信号处理中的全谱分析。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的实验表明，TimeEmb优于现有最优基线方法，且需要更少的计算资源。该轻量框架还能通过简单集成改进现有时间序列预测方法。

Conclusion: TimeEmb通过有效的静态-动态解耦，成功解决了时间序列预测中的非平稳性问题，在性能和计算效率方面均有显著提升。

Abstract: Temporal non-stationarity, the phenomenon that time series distributions
change over time, poses fundamental challenges to reliable time series
forecasting. Intuitively, the complex time series can be decomposed into two
factors, \ie time-invariant and time-varying components, which indicate static
and dynamic patterns, respectively. Nonetheless, existing methods often
conflate the time-varying and time-invariant components, and jointly learn the
combined long-term patterns and short-term fluctuations, leading to suboptimal
performance facing distribution shifts. To address this issue, we initiatively
propose a lightweight static-dynamic decomposition framework, TimeEmb, for time
series forecasting. TimeEmb innovatively separates time series into two
complementary components: (1) time-invariant component, captured by a novel
global embedding module that learns persistent representations across time
series, and (2) time-varying component, processed by an efficient
frequency-domain filtering mechanism inspired by full-spectrum analysis in
signal processing. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeEmb
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and requires fewer computational
resources. We conduct comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses to
verify the efficacy of static-dynamic disentanglement. This lightweight
framework can also improve existing time-series forecasting methods with simple
integration. To ease reproducibility, the code is available at
https://github.com/showmeon/TimeEmb.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Eyes-on-Me攻击方法，通过将对抗文档分解为可重用的注意力吸引器和焦点区域，实现了对检索增强生成(RAG)系统的高效数据投毒攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统数据投毒攻击扩展性差，需要为每个目标短语优化投毒文档，成本高昂。

Method: 将对抗文档分解为注意力吸引器和焦点区域，吸引器优化用于引导注意力到焦点区域，攻击者可在焦点区域插入语义诱饵或恶意指令。通过识别与攻击成功强相关的注意力头子集来实现。

Result: 在18个端到端RAG设置中，平均攻击成功率从21.9%提升到57.8%（提高35.9个百分点，是先前工作的2.6倍）。单个优化后的吸引器无需重新训练即可迁移到未见过的黑盒检索器和生成器。

Conclusion: 建立了一个可扩展的RAG数据投毒范式，表明模块化、可重用组件对现代AI系统构成实际威胁，同时揭示了注意力集中与模型输出之间的强关联，为可解释性研究提供信息。

Abstract: Existing data poisoning attacks on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
systems scale poorly because they require costly optimization of poisoned
documents for each target phrase. We introduce Eyes-on-Me, a modular attack
that decomposes an adversarial document into reusable Attention Attractors and
Focus Regions. Attractors are optimized to direct attention to the Focus
Region. Attackers can then insert semantic baits for the retriever or malicious
instructions for the generator, adapting to new targets at near zero cost. This
is achieved by steering a small subset of attention heads that we empirically
identify as strongly correlated with attack success. Across 18 end-to-end RAG
settings (3 datasets $\times$ 2 retrievers $\times$ 3 generators), Eyes-on-Me
raises average attack success rates from 21.9 to 57.8 (+35.9 points,
2.6$\times$ over prior work). A single optimized attractor transfers to unseen
black box retrievers and generators without retraining. Our findings establish
a scalable paradigm for RAG data poisoning and show that modular, reusable
components pose a practical threat to modern AI systems. They also reveal a
strong link between attention concentration and model outputs, informing
interpretability research.

Motivation: 现有在线持续学习方法要么使用排练缓冲区存储样本，要么依赖任务边界信息，但这会带来数据安全和隐私问题，且在实际应用中任务边界往往不可知。

Method: 结合提示学习和最近类均值分类器，在不存储样本且不使用任务边界或身份信息的情况下进行在线持续学习。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的广泛实验结果表明，该方法在解决灾难性遗忘问题上具有有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了无需排练缓冲区和任务边界的在线持续学习，为数据安全和隐私敏感场景提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: The main challenge of continual learning is \textit{catastrophic forgetting}.
Because of processing data in one pass, online continual learning (OCL) is one
of the most difficult continual learning scenarios. To address catastrophic
forgetting in OCL, some existing studies use a rehearsal buffer to store
samples and replay them in the later learning process, other studies do not
store samples but assume a sequence of learning tasks so that the task
identities can be explored. However, storing samples may raise data security or
privacy concerns and it is not always possible to identify the boundaries
between learning tasks in one pass of data processing. It motivates us to
investigate rehearsal-free and task-free OCL (F2OCL). By integrating prompt
learning with an NCM classifier, this study has effectively tackled
catastrophic forgetting without storing samples and without usage of task
boundaries or identities. The extensive experimental results on two benchmarks
have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Motivation: 探索神经网络内部特征表示的可解释性方法，特别是寻找能够揭示模型所学特征的实用工具。

Method: 使用经验神经正切核(eNTK)进行特征分析，在叠加玩具模型和模块加法任务上验证其有效性，并分析层间eNTK和谱演化。

Result: eNTK成功恢复了叠加模型中的真实特征（稀疏和密集机制）以及模块加法中的傅里叶特征族，并能定位特征到特定层，诊断grokking相变。

Conclusion: eNTK分析为特征发现和小模型中的相变检测提供了实用的方法。

Abstract: We provide evidence that eigenanalysis of the empirical neural tangent kernel
(eNTK) can surface the features used by trained neural networks. Across two
standard toy models for mechanistic interpretability, Toy Models of
Superposition (TMS) and a 1-layer MLP trained on modular addition, we find that
the eNTK exhibits sharp spectral cliffs whose top eigenspaces align with
ground-truth features. In TMS, the eNTK recovers the ground-truth features in
both the sparse (high superposition) and dense regimes. In modular arithmetic,
the eNTK can be used to recover Fourier feature families. Moreover, we provide
evidence that a layerwise eNTK localizes features to specific layers and that
the evolution of the eNTK eigenspectrum can be used to diagnose the grokking
phase transition. These results suggest that eNTK analysis may provide a
practical handle for feature discovery and for detecting phase changes in small
models.

*Kai Gu,Weishi Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了持续学习中神经网络对捷径特征的利用问题，提出了Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI)诊断指标来区分真实迁移和捷径特征导致的性能膨胀，发现在CIFAR-100基准测试中，捷径特征反而成为持续学习方法的干扰而非帮助。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络经常利用捷径特征（输入与标签间的偶然相关性），这会损害模型在分布变化下的鲁棒性。在持续学习中，捷径特征的利用会持续存在并加剧，导致模型偏向于使用容易满足先前任务标签的特征，阻碍新技能的学习。

Method: 提出了Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI)诊断指标，包含三个可解释维度：(i) 适应延迟(AD)、(ii) 性能赤字(PD)、(iii) 相对次优特征依赖(SFR_rel)。在CIFAR-100持续学习基准上测试了多种CL方法，并在第二阶段故意引入虚假的洋红色补丁作为捷径特征。

Result: CL方法比从头训练基准更早达到准确率阈值（负AD），但在有补丁的捷径类上最终准确率略低（正PD）。屏蔽补丁后CL方法准确率提高而基准略有下降，产生负SFR_rel，表明补丁在此设置中成为CL模型的干扰而非帮助性捷径。

Conclusion: 捷径特征在持续学习环境中可能成为干扰而非帮助，CL方法表现出对捷径特征的依赖，这阻碍了最优特征的学习。ERI指标有效揭示了这种捷径诱导的刚性现象。

Abstract: Deep neural networks frequently exploit shortcut features, defined as
incidental correlations between inputs and labels without causal meaning.
Shortcut features undermine robustness and reduce reliability under
distribution shifts. In continual learning (CL), the consequences of shortcut
exploitation can persist and intensify: weights inherited from earlier tasks
bias representation reuse toward whatever features most easily satisfied prior
labels, mirroring the cognitive Einstellung effect, a phenomenon where past
habits block optimal solutions. Whereas catastrophic forgetting erodes past
skills, shortcut-induced rigidity throttles the acquisition of new ones. We
introduce the Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI), a compact diagnostic that
disentangles genuine transfer from cue-inflated performance using three
interpretable facets: (i) Adaptation Delay (AD), (ii) Performance Deficit (PD),
and (iii) Relative Suboptimal Feature Reliance (SFR_rel). On a two-phase
CIFAR-100 CL benchmark with a deliberately spurious magenta patch in Phase 2,
we evaluate Naive fine-tuning (SGD), online Elastic Weight Consolidation
(EWC_on), Dark Experience Replay (DER++), Gradient Projection Memory (GPM), and
Deep Generative Replay (DGR). Across these continual learning methods, we
observe that CL methods reach accuracy thresholds earlier than a Scratch-T2
baseline (negative AD) but achieve slightly lower final accuracy on patched
shortcut classes (positive PD). Masking the patch improves accuracy for CL
methods while slightly reducing Scratch-T2, yielding negative SFR_rel. This
pattern indicates the patch acted as a distractor for CL models in this setting
rather than a helpful shortcut.

TL;DR: DVD是一个基于潜在扩散模型的源自由域适应框架，通过扩散模块在潜在空间中生成源域特征提示，实现无需访问源数据的知识迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有潜在扩散模型主要关注生成任务，其在判别性迁移方面的潜力未被充分探索。本文旨在解决源自由域适应中无法访问源数据的核心挑战。

Method: 在源域训练阶段，将标签信息编码到特征邻域的潜在空间中；在适应阶段，从目标特征邻域采样，使用冻结的扩散模块生成源域特征提示，通过InfoNCE损失对齐目标编码器。

Result: 在标准SFDA基准测试中，DVD超越了最先进方法。相同的潜在扩散模块还能提升源分类器在域内数据的准确性，并在监督分类和域泛化实验中提升性能。

Conclusion: DVD将潜在扩散模型重新解释为实用、保护隐私的显式知识迁移桥梁，解决了源自由域适应中先前方法未能解决的核心挑战。

Abstract: Recent work on latent diffusion models (LDMs) has focused almost exclusively
on generative tasks, leaving their potential for discriminative transfer
largely unexplored. We introduce Discriminative Vicinity Diffusion (DVD), a
novel LDM-based framework for a more practical variant of source-free domain
adaptation (SFDA): the source provider may share not only a pre-trained
classifier but also an auxiliary latent diffusion module, trained once on the
source data and never exposing raw source samples. DVD encodes each source
feature's label information into its latent vicinity by fitting a Gaussian
prior over its k-nearest neighbors and training the diffusion network to drift
noisy samples back to label-consistent representations. During adaptation, we
sample from each target feature's latent vicinity, apply the frozen diffusion
module to generate source-like cues, and use a simple InfoNCE loss to align the
target encoder to these cues, explicitly transferring decision boundaries
without source access. Across standard SFDA benchmarks, DVD outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. We further show that the same latent diffusion module
enhances the source classifier's accuracy on in-domain data and boosts
performance in supervised classification and domain generalization experiments.
DVD thus reinterprets LDMs as practical, privacy-preserving bridges for
explicit knowledge transfer, addressing a core challenge in source-free domain
adaptation that prior methods have yet to solve.

Conclusion: CPFM方法有效解决了黑盒时间序列域适应问题，利用基础模型克服时空动态特性，在多个数据集上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: The black-box domain adaptation (BBDA) topic is developed to address the
privacy and security issues where only an application programming interface
(API) of the source model is available for domain adaptations. Although the
BBDA topic has attracted growing research attentions, existing works mostly
target the vision applications and are not directly applicable to the
time-series applications possessing unique spatio-temporal characteristics. In
addition, none of existing approaches have explored the strength of foundation
model for black box time-series domain adaptation (BBTSDA). This paper proposes
a concept of Cross-Prompt Foundation Model (CPFM) for the BBTSDA problems. CPFM
is constructed under a dual branch network structure where each branch is
equipped with a unique prompt to capture different characteristics of data
distributions. In the domain adaptation phase, the reconstruction learning
phase in the prompt and input levels is developed. All of which are built upon
a time-series foundation model to overcome the spatio-temporal dynamic. Our
rigorous experiments substantiate the advantage of CPFM achieving improved
results with noticeable margins from its competitors in three time-series
datasets of different application domains.

Method: 在GPT-2和Qwen-3上使用匹配的潜在token预算，测试双架构系统（Base与Coprocessor交换潜在消息），并与统一的软嵌入基线进行比较。

Result: 联合微调（H2）表现最强，增加通道容量（H1）收益有限；统一基线几乎匹配H2并超越H1；扩展潜在token预算未能改善鲁棒性；潜在空间分析显示有限的专业化。

Conclusion: 双模型潜在推理在原理上仍有前景，但需要明确塑造潜在空间用于算法规划的目标和通信机制。

Abstract: Should LLM reasoning live in a separate module, or within a single model's
forward pass and representational space? We study dual-architecture latent
reasoning, where a fluent Base exchanges latent messages with a Coprocessor,
and test two hypotheses aimed at improving latent communication over Liu et al.
(2024): (H1) increase channel capacity; (H2) learn communication via joint
finetuning. Under matched latent-token budgets on GPT-2 and Qwen-3, H2 is
consistently strongest while H1 yields modest gains. A unified soft-embedding
baseline, a single model with the same forward pass and shared representations,
using the same latent-token budget, nearly matches H2 and surpasses H1,
suggesting current dual designs mostly add compute rather than qualitatively
improving reasoning. Across GSM8K, ProsQA, and a Countdown stress test with
increasing branching factor, scaling the latent-token budget beyond small
values fails to improve robustness. Latent analyses show overlapping subspaces
with limited specialization, consistent with weak reasoning gains. We conclude
dual-model latent reasoning remains promising in principle, but likely requires
objectives and communication mechanisms that explicitly shape latent spaces for
algorithmic planning.

TL;DR: 本文对最先进的电路发现方法EAP-IG进行了系统性稳定性分析，发现该方法存在高结构方差和超参数敏感性，质疑其发现的稳定性，并提出了报告稳定性指标的最佳实践建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发可信人工智能需要超越黑盒性能指标，理解模型的内部计算。机制可解释性旨在识别模型行为的算法机制，但其科学严谨性依赖于发现结果的可靠性。

Method: 将可解释性方法视为统计估计器，通过输入重采样、提示改写、超参数变化和因果分析中注入噪声等控制扰动，系统评估EAP-IG方法的方差和鲁棒性。

Result: 在多种模型和任务上的结果显示，EAP-IG表现出高结构方差和超参数敏感性，其发现结果的稳定性受到质疑。

Conclusion: 建议领域内常规报告稳定性指标，以促进更严谨和统计基础的可解释性科学。

Abstract: The development of trustworthy artificial intelligence requires moving beyond
black-box performance metrics toward an understanding of models' internal
computations. Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) aims to meet this need by
identifying the algorithmic mechanisms underlying model behaviors. Yet, the
scientific rigor of MI critically depends on the reliability of its findings.
In this work, we argue that interpretability methods, such as circuit
discovery, should be viewed as statistical estimators, subject to questions of
variance and robustness. To illustrate this statistical framing, we present a
systematic stability analysis of a state-of-the-art circuit discovery method:
EAP-IG. We evaluate its variance and robustness through a comprehensive suite
of controlled perturbations, including input resampling, prompt paraphrasing,
hyperparameter variation, and injected noise within the causal analysis itself.
Across a diverse set of models and tasks, our results demonstrate that EAP-IG
exhibits high structural variance and sensitivity to hyperparameters,
questioning the stability of its findings. Based on these results, we offer a
set of best-practice recommendations for the field, advocating for the routine
reporting of stability metrics to promote a more rigorous and statistically
grounded science of interpretability.

TL;DR: 提出了DAV框架，将扩散对齐建模为变分期望最大化过程，通过交替的E步和M步优化奖励同时保持多样性，应用于文本到图像合成和DNA序列设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习或直接反向传播的扩散对齐方法虽然能最大化奖励，但经常出现奖励过优化和模式崩溃问题，需要一种能同时优化奖励并保持多样性的方法。

Method: DAV框架将扩散对齐建模为变分期望最大化过程：E步使用测试时搜索生成多样且奖励对齐的样本，M步使用E步发现的样本精炼扩散模型。

Result: DAV能够在连续和离散任务（文本到图像合成和DNA序列设计）中优化奖励同时保持多样性。

Conclusion: DAV框架通过变分期望最大化方法有效解决了扩散对齐中的奖励过优化和模式崩溃问题，在保持多样性的同时优化奖励。

Abstract: Diffusion alignment aims to optimize diffusion models for the downstream
objective. While existing methods based on reinforcement learning or direct
backpropagation achieve considerable success in maximizing rewards, they often
suffer from reward over-optimization and mode collapse. We introduce Diffusion
Alignment as Variational Expectation-Maximization (DAV), a framework that
formulates diffusion alignment as an iterative process alternating between two
complementary phases: the E-step and the M-step. In the E-step, we employ
test-time search to generate diverse and reward-aligned samples. In the M-step,
we refine the diffusion model using samples discovered by the E-step. We
demonstrate that DAV can optimize reward while preserving diversity for both
continuous and discrete tasks: text-to-image synthesis and DNA sequence design.

TL;DR: 差分注意力机制通过减法结构减少冗余信息，但增加了对抗攻击的脆弱性，揭示了注意力机制在选择性聚焦与鲁棒性之间的权衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究差分注意力机制在提升任务相关焦点同时，是否引入了对抗扰动的结构脆弱性

Method: 理论分析负梯度对齐机制，并在ViT/DiffViT和CLIP/DiffCLIP模型上进行系统实验，涵盖五个数据集

Result: 差分注意力导致更高的攻击成功率、频繁的梯度对立和更强的局部敏感性，深度实验显示小扰动下具有噪声抵消保护但大攻击下失效

Conclusion: 差分注意力在干净输入上提升判别性聚焦，但增加了对抗脆弱性，未来注意力机制需要同时考虑选择性和鲁棒性设计

Abstract: Differential Attention (DA) has been proposed as a refinement to standard
attention, suppressing redundant or noisy context through a subtractive
structure and thereby reducing contextual hallucination. While this design
sharpens task-relevant focus, we show that it also introduces a structural
fragility under adversarial perturbations. Our theoretical analysis identifies
negative gradient alignment-a configuration encouraged by DA's subtraction-as
the key driver of sensitivity amplification, leading to increased gradient
norms and elevated local Lipschitz constants. We empirically validate this
Fragile Principle through systematic experiments on ViT/DiffViT and evaluations
of pretrained CLIP/DiffCLIP, spanning five datasets in total. These results
demonstrate higher attack success rates, frequent gradient opposition, and
stronger local sensitivity compared to standard attention. Furthermore,
depth-dependent experiments reveal a robustness crossover: stacking DA layers
attenuates small perturbations via depth-dependent noise cancellation, though
this protection fades under larger attack budgets. Overall, our findings
uncover a fundamental trade-off: DA improves discriminative focus on clean
inputs but increases adversarial vulnerability, underscoring the need to
jointly design for selectivity and robustness in future attention mechanisms.

TL;DR: 对基于分类器的质量过滤方法进行深入分析，发现该方法虽然能提升下游任务性能，但并未改善高质量数据集上的语言建模能力，挑战了该方法能捕捉有意义数据质量的观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模模型在混合质量的网络爬取数据上预训练，数据过滤至关重要。基于分类器的质量过滤是流行方法，但需要深入分析其有效性。

Method: 分析基于分类器的质量过滤方法，该方法训练二元分类器区分预训练数据和小型高质量数据集，为每个文档分配质量分数并保留高分文档。

Result: CQF能提升下游任务性能，但并未改善高质量数据集上的语言建模能力。与通过随机标记置换获得的合成数据相比，表现出截然不同的趋势。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了CQF能捕捉有意义数据质量概念的观点，揭示了该方法在数据过滤中的局限性。

Abstract: Large-scale models are pretrained on massive web-crawled datasets containing
documents of mixed quality, making data filtering essential. A popular method
is Classifier-based Quality Filtering (CQF), which trains a binary classifier
to distinguish between pretraining data and a small, high-quality set. It
assigns each pretraining document a quality score defined as the classifier's
score and retains only the top-scoring ones. We provide an in-depth analysis of
CQF. We show that while CQF improves downstream task performance, it does not
necessarily enhance language modeling on the high-quality dataset. We explain
this paradox by the fact that CQF implicitly filters the high-quality dataset
as well. We further compare the behavior of models trained with CQF to those
trained on synthetic data of increasing quality, obtained via random token
permutations, and find starkly different trends. Our results challenge the view
that CQF captures a meaningful notion of data quality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级诊断套件来量化大型语言模型中前馈网络的有效容量利用，发现软秩随宽度呈幂律增长而硬秩仅次线性增长，揭示了FFN宽度选择在尾部容量和主导模式容量之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缩放定律关注模型大小与损失的关系，但忽略了组件如何利用潜在空间。本文旨在研究前馈网络的有效容量利用问题。

Method: 使用轻量级诊断套件——硬秩（参与比）、软秩（香农秩）、谱集中度和复合谱利用指数，量化LLaMA、GPT-2和nGPT系列模型中前馈网络的潜在方向激活情况。

Result: 发现不对称谱缩放定律：软秩随FFN宽度呈近乎完美的幂律增长，而硬秩仅次线性增长且方差高。这表明加宽FFN主要增加低能量尾部方向，而主导模式子空间早期饱和。

Conclusion: FFN宽度选择应作为尾部容量与主导模式容量之间的原则性权衡，为推理高效的大型语言模型设计提供具体指导。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) scale, the question is not only how large
they become, but how much of their capacity is effectively utilized. Existing
scaling laws relate model size to loss, yet overlook how components exploit
their latent space. We study feed-forward networks (FFNs) and recast width
selection as a spectral utilization problem. Using a lightweight diagnostic
suite -- Hard Rank (participation ratio), Soft Rank (Shannon rank), Spectral
Concentration, and the composite Spectral Utilization Index (SUI) -- we
quantify how many latent directions are meaningfully activated across LLaMA,
GPT-2, and nGPT families. Our key finding is an asymmetric spectral scaling
law: soft rank follows an almost perfect power law with FFN width, while hard
rank grows only sublinearly and with high variance. This asymmetry suggests
that widening FFNs mostly adds low-energy tail directions, while dominant-mode
subspaces saturate early. Moreover, at larger widths, variance further
collapses into a narrow subspace, leaving much of the latent space
under-utilized. These results recast FFN width selection as a principled
trade-off between tail capacity and dominant-mode capacity, offering concrete
guidance for inference-efficient LLM design.

TL;DR: 本研究使用线性回归、回归决策树和随机森林三种机器学习模型预测预期寿命，发现随机森林模型表现最佳（R²=0.9423），免疫接种率和人口统计学特征是关键预测因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测预期寿命对公共卫生和社会经济发展至关重要，但由于人口、环境和医疗因素的复杂相互作用，这仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 使用来自WHO和UN的真实数据集，采用线性回归、回归决策树和随机森林三种机器学习模型，通过R²、MAE和RMSE评估性能，并进行可解释性分析。

Result: 随机森林模型表现最佳（R²=0.9423），显著优于线性回归和回归决策树。免疫接种率（白喉、麻疹）和人口统计学属性（HIV/AIDS、成人死亡率）是预测预期寿命的关键驱动因素。

Conclusion: 集成方法与透明度相结合能有效应对公共卫生挑战。未来研究应探索高级插补策略、替代算法和更新数据，以进一步提高预测准确性，支持基于证据的全球卫生政策制定。

Abstract: Life expectancy is a fundamental indicator of population health and
socio-economic well-being, yet accurately forecasting it remains challenging
due to the interplay of demographic, environmental, and healthcare factors.
This study evaluates three machine learning models -- Linear Regression (LR),
Regression Decision Tree (RDT), and Random Forest (RF), using a real-world
dataset drawn from World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations (UN)
sources. After extensive preprocessing to address missing values and
inconsistencies, each model's performance was assessed with $R^2$, Mean
Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Results show that RF
achieves the highest predictive accuracy ($R^2 = 0.9423$), significantly
outperforming LR and RDT. Interpretability was prioritized through p-values for
LR and feature importance metrics for the tree-based models, revealing
immunization rates (diphtheria, measles) and demographic attributes (HIV/AIDS,
adult mortality) as critical drivers of life-expectancy predictions. These
insights underscore the synergy between ensemble methods and transparency in
addressing public-health challenges. Future research should explore advanced
imputation strategies, alternative algorithms (e.g., neural networks), and
updated data to further refine predictive accuracy and support evidence-based
policymaking in global health contexts.

Motivation: 挑战GRPO需要大组规模的传统假设，探索最小化rollout数量的可行性，以减少计算成本。

Method: 将GRPO重构为对比学习形式，建立与DPO的理论联系，提出并验证仅需2个rollout的2-GRPO配置。

Result: 2-GRPO在性能上与16-GRPO相当，但仅使用1/8的rollouts，训练时间减少超过70%。

Conclusion: GRPO的最小可行配置仅为2个rollout，这颠覆了传统认知，为LLM后训练提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a prominent reinforcement
learning algorithm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs). It is
commonly believed that GRPO necessitates a large group size to ensure stable
training via precise statistical estimation, which incurs substantial
computational overhead. In this work, we challenge this assumption by reframing
GRPO as a form of contrastive learning, which reveals a fundamental connection
to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Motivated by DPO's empirical success,
we investigate the minimal two-rollout case (2-GRPO), a configuration
previously deemed infeasible. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis to
validate 2-GRPO and demonstrate empirically that it achieves performance on par
with 16-GRPO, despite using only 1/8 of the rollouts and reducing training time
by over 70%.

Motivation: 理解大语言模型在强化学习训练中的参数动态变化，目前对此了解甚少。

Method: 识别RL训练中参数更新的两个基本特性：秩1主导和秩1线性动态，并基于此设计AlphaRL加速框架。

Result: 在8个LLM和7种算法上的实验验证了这些特性的普适性，AlphaRL实现2.5倍加速且保持>96%推理性能。

Conclusion: 这些发现为大规模RL训练提供了原则性、可解释且高效的训练范式。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are
largely driven by reinforcement learning (RL), yet the underlying parameter
dynamics during RL training remain poorly understood. This work identifies two
fundamental properties of RL-induced parameter updates in LLMs: (1) Rank-1
Dominance, where the top singular subspace of the parameter update matrix
nearly fully determines reasoning improvements, recovering over 99\% of
performance gains; and (2) Rank-1 Linear Dynamics, where this dominant subspace
evolves linearly throughout training, enabling accurate prediction from early
checkpoints. Extensive experiments across 8 LLMs and 7 algorithms validate the
generalizability of these properties. More importantly, based on these
findings, we propose AlphaRL, a plug-in acceleration framework that
extrapolates the final parameter update using a short early training window,
achieving up to 2.5 speedup while retaining \textgreater 96\% of reasoning
performance without extra modules or hyperparameter tuning. This positions our
finding as a versatile and practical tool for large-scale RL, opening a path
toward principled, interpretable, and efficient training paradigm for LLMs.

Motivation: 之前的研究未能充分解释SSMs高性能背后的机制，缺乏对SSMs学习动态的理论理解。

Method: 通过分析输入时间序列在状态中的存储方式来评估SSMs的记忆能力，建立了S4模型与简化对角循环权重S4的理论等价性，并基于此阐明学习动态。

Result: 实验证实延长记忆很困难，强调了初始化的重要性；固定循环权重比自适应权重能获得相当或更好的性能，且收敛更快。

Conclusion: 研究为SSMs提供了新的理论基础，并可能提供一种新颖的优化策略。

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) have gained attention by showing potential to
outperform Transformers. However, previous studies have not sufficiently
addressed the mechanisms underlying their high performance owing to a lack of
theoretical explanation of SSMs' learning dynamics. In this study, we provide
such an explanation and propose an improved training strategy. The memory
capacity of SSMs can be evaluated by examining how input time series are stored
in their current state. Such an examination reveals a tradeoff between memory
accuracy and length, as well as the theoretical equivalence between the
structured state space sequence model (S4) and a simplified S4 with diagonal
recurrent weights. This theoretical foundation allows us to elucidate the
learning dynamics, proving the importance of initial parameters. Our analytical
results suggest that successful learning requires the initial memory structure
to be the longest possible even if memory accuracy may deteriorate or the
gradient lose the teacher information. Experiments on tasks requiring long
memory confirmed that extending memory is difficult, emphasizing the importance
of initialization. Furthermore, we found that fixing recurrent weights can be
more advantageous than adapting them because it achieves comparable or even
higher performance with faster convergence. Our results provide a new
theoretical foundation for SSMs and potentially offer a novel optimization
strategy.

Motivation: ANNS系统在最终精炼阶段花费高达99%的查询时间计算距离，存在严重的验证瓶颈问题。

Method: 使用数据自适应学习的正交变换，通过层级主内存布局、SIMD向量化部分距离计算和缓存感知访问模式，在不修改索引的情况下集成到现有ANNS方法中。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、GIST、OpenAI Ada 2和Large 3等多样化数据集上实验表明，PANORAMA实现了2-30倍的端到端加速，且无召回损失。

Conclusion: PANORAMA有效解决了ANNS验证瓶颈，显著提升了查询效率，同时保持了原有的召回性能。

Abstract: Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search (ANNS) efficiently finds data items whose
embeddings are close to that of a given query in a high-dimensional space,
aiming to balance accuracy with speed. Used in recommendation systems, image
and video retrieval, natural language processing, and retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), ANNS algorithms such as IVFPQ, HNSW graphs, Annoy, and MRPT
utilize graph, tree, clustering, and quantization techniques to navigate large
vector spaces. Despite this progress, ANNS systems spend up to 99\% of query
time to compute distances in their final refinement phase. In this paper, we
present PANORAMA, a machine learning-driven approach that tackles the ANNS
verification bottleneck through data-adaptive learned orthogonal transforms
that facilitate the accretive refinement of distance bounds. Such transforms
compact over 90\% of signal energy into the first half of dimensions, enabling
early candidate pruning with partial distance computations. We integrate
PANORAMA into state-of-the-art ANNS methods, namely IVFPQ/Flat, HNSW, MRPT, and
Annoy, without index modification, using level-major memory layouts,
SIMD-vectorized partial distance computations, and cache-aware access patterns.
Experiments across diverse datasets -- from image-based CIFAR-10 and GIST to
modern embedding spaces including OpenAI's Ada 2 and Large 3 -- demonstrate
that PANORAMA affords a 2--30$\times$ end-to-end speedup with no recall loss.

Abstract: We revisit the problem of private online learning, in which a learner
receives a sequence of $T$ data points and has to respond at each time-step a
hypothesis. It is required that the entire stream of output hypotheses should
satisfy differential privacy. Prior work of Golowich and Livni [2021]
established that every concept class $\mathcal{H}$ with finite Littlestone
dimension $d$ is privately online learnable in the realizable setting. In
particular, they proposed an algorithm that achieves an $O_{d}(\log T)$ mistake
bound against an oblivious adversary. However, their approach yields a
suboptimal $\tilde{O}_{d}(\sqrt{T})$ bound against an adaptive adversary. In
this work, we present a new algorithm with a mistake bound of $O_{d}(\log T)$
against an adaptive adversary, closing this gap. We further investigate the
problem in the agnostic setting, which is more general than the realizable
setting as it does not impose any assumptions on the data. We give an algorithm
that obtains a sublinear regret of $\tilde{O}_d(\sqrt{T})$ for generic
Littlestone classes, demonstrating that they are also privately online
learnable in the agnostic setting.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的训练范式从静态数据集转向基于经验的学习，需要开发一个标准化的环境模拟器来促进代理在复杂环境中的技能获取。

Method: 开发GEM框架，包括标准化接口、异步向量化执行、灵活包装器、多样化环境套件和集成工具。使用REINFORCE with Return Batch Normalization (ReBN)在24个环境中建立基线，并与PPO、GRPO进行对比实验。

Conclusion: GEM作为一个训练环境和评估工具包，有望加速未来基于代理的大型语言模型研究。

Abstract: The training paradigm for large language models (LLMs) is moving from static
datasets to experience-based learning, where agents acquire skills via
interacting with complex environments. To facilitate this transition we
introduce GEM (General Experience Maker), an open-source environment simulator
designed for the age of LLMs. Analogous to OpenAI-Gym for traditional
reinforcement learning (RL), GEM provides a standardized framework for the
environment-agent interface, including asynchronous vectorized execution for
high throughput, and flexible wrappers for easy extensibility. GEM also
features a diverse suite of environments, robust integrated tools, and
single-file example scripts demonstrating using GEM with five popular RL
training frameworks. Along with this, we also provide a set of baselines across
24 environments using REINFORCE with Return Batch Normalization (ReBN), which
-- unlike GRPO -- is compatible with the full RL setting of dense per-turn
rewards and offers better credit assignment. We further conduct apple-to-apple
benchmarking of PPO, GRPO and REINFORCE in both single- and multi-turn settings
using GEM to shed light on the algorithmic designs. Lastly, GEM also functions
as a convenient evaluation toolkit besides a training environment. We hope this
framework can help accelerate future agentic LLM research.

Abstract: We study what actually works and what doesn't for training large language
models as agents via multi-turn reinforcement learning. Despite rapid progress,
existing frameworks and definitions are fragmented, and there is no systematic
formulation or analysis of which design choices matter across tasks. We address
this gap by first breaking down the design space into three inter-related
pillars -- environment, reward, and policy -- and empirically derive a recipe
for training LLM agents in situated textual domains. In particular, we test
TextWorld and ALFWorld, popular domains for testing situated embodied
reasoning, as well as SWE-Gym for more software engineering style tasks. (i)
For the environment, we analyze the impacts of task complexity in terms of
sizes of the state and action spaces as well as optimal solution length,
finding that even simple environments within a domain can provide signal on how
well an agent can generalize to more complex tasks. (ii) For the reward, we
ablate relative reward sparsity, observing that while dense turn-level rewards
accelerate training, performance and stability is highly dependent on the
choice of RL algorithm. (iii) And for the agent's policy, we explore the
interplay between reward sparsity and biased (PPO, GRPO) and unbiased (RLOO)

*Lauri Kurki,Yaniel Cabrera,Samu Karanko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的校准误差度量ETCE来评估降水临近预报的概率校准质量，并开发了基于选择缩放和提前时间条件化的后处理技术来改善模型校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经天气模型在降水临近预报中会产生校准不良的概率预测，而现有的标准校准指标无法有效捕捉不同降水阈值下的校准误差。

Method: 引入了期望阈值校准误差(ETCE)作为新指标，并将计算机视觉中的后处理技术扩展到预报领域，采用选择缩放和提前时间条件化方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能够在不降低预报质量的情况下有效减少模型的校准误差。

Conclusion: ETCE指标和提出的后处理技术能够显著改善降水临近预报的概率校准性能，为天气敏感决策提供更可靠的预测。

Abstract: Reliable precipitation nowcasting is critical for weather-sensitive
decision-making, yet neural weather models (NWMs) can produce poorly calibrated
probabilistic forecasts. Standard calibration metrics such as the expected
calibration error (ECE) fail to capture miscalibration across precipitation
thresholds. We introduce the expected thresholded calibration error (ETCE), a
new metric that better captures miscalibration in ordered classes like
precipitation amounts. We extend post-processing techniques from computer
vision to the forecasting domain. Our results show that selective scaling with
lead time conditioning reduces model miscalibration without reducing the
forecast quality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Prompt Curriculum Learning (PCL)，一种轻量级强化学习算法，通过学习的价值模型选择中等难度提示来后训练语言模型，在推理任务上实现性能与效率的最佳平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后训练LLMs通过强化学习对批处理和提示选择策略仍然敏感，需要找到平衡生成效率和梯度质量的最佳训练方法。

Method: PCL使用并发更新的价值模型以在线方式识别当前策略的中等难度提示，通过关注产生高有效比的信息性提示来优化训练。

Result: 相比基于rollout的过滤方法，PCL在MATH和DeepScaleR上分别实现12.1倍和16.9倍的提示识别速度提升，达到最高性能或显著减少达到可比性能所需时间。

Conclusion: PCL提供了一种新方法，在推理导向的强化学习中实现了上界性能与效率之间的改进权衡。

Abstract: We introduce Prompt Curriculum Learning (PCL), a lightweight reinforcement
learning (RL) algorithm that selects intermediate-difficulty prompts using a
learned value model to post-train language models. Since post-training LLMs via
RL remains sensitive to batching and prompt selection strategies, we first
conduct a series of systematic experiments where we (1) determine the optimal
training batch size that balances generation efficiency and gradient quality
and (2) establish the importance of focusing on prompts of intermediate
difficulty for the policy. We build upon these results to design PCL, which
identifies prompts of intermediate difficulty for the current policy in an
on-policy manner by using a value model that is concurrently updated based on
the current policy. By focusing on informative prompts that yield high
effective ratios, PCL achieves either the highest performance or requires
significantly less time to reach comparable performance to its counterparts.
Compared to rollout-based filtering methods, PCL avoids costly rollouts and
achieves $12.1\times$ and $16.9\times$ faster speed on identifying
intermediate-difficulty prompts when training on MATH and DeepScaleR,
respectively. We further demonstrate that our value model accurately predicts
prompt difficulty and allows PCL to focus on progressively more challenging
prompts during RL. Our results present a new methodology that delivers improved
tradeoff between upper-bound performance and efficiency for reasoning-focused
RL.

*Ahmad-Reza Ehyaei,Golnoosh Farnadi,Samira Samadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了结构因果最优传输方法，通过结合结构方程信息来增强分布鲁棒优化中的模糊集设计，提高分布的现实性，并提供了高效的求解算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的分布鲁棒优化方法仅利用了因果图信息，没有充分利用结构方程信息，导致模糊集设计不够精确，无法包含足够现实的数据分布。

Method: 提出结构因果最优传输及其模糊集，通过正则化项替代复杂因果约束，使用凸差规划算法高效求解，并在结构信息缺失时提供有限样本保证。

Result: 该方法能够克服最优传输问题的维度诅咒，实现维度无关的更快收缩速度，提高了分布鲁棒优化的性能。

Conclusion: 结合结构方程信息能够显著增强分布鲁棒优化的模糊集设计，提供更现实的数据分布建模和更高效的求解方法。

Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization tackles out-of-sample issues like
overfitting and distribution shifts by adopting an adversarial approach over a
range of possible data distributions, known as the ambiguity set. To balance
conservatism and accuracy, these sets must include realistic probability
distributions by leveraging information from the nominal distribution. Assuming
that nominal distributions arise from a structural causal model with a directed
acyclic graph $\mathcal{G}$ and structural equations, previous methods such as
adapted and $\mathcal{G}$-causal optimal transport have only utilized causal
graph information in designing ambiguity sets. In this work, we propose
incorporating structural equations, which include causal graph information, to
enhance ambiguity sets, resulting in more realistic distributions. We introduce
structural causal optimal transport and its associated ambiguity set,
demonstrating their advantages and connections to previous methods. A key
benefit of our approach is a relaxed version, where a regularization term
replaces the complex causal constraints, enabling an efficient algorithm via
difference-of-convex programming to solve structural causal optimal transport.
We also show that when structural information is absent and must be estimated,
our approach remains effective and provides finite sample guarantees. Lastly,
we address the radius of ambiguity sets, illustrating how our method overcomes
the curse of dimensionality in optimal transport problems, achieving faster
shrinkage with dimension-free order.

TL;DR: 提出MAH-DPO框架，通过向量化奖励和多动作头机制实现多目标对齐，在数学推理、价值对齐和多轮对话中同时提升多个目标性能，减少目标间权衡，并提供细粒度推理时用户控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将异质信号压缩为单一优化目标，无法同时处理可验证奖励（数学准确性）、非验证主观偏好（人类价值观）和复杂交互场景（多轮AI辅导对话）等多维对齐需求。

Method: 统一框架包括：(i)标准化过程奖励模型训练；(ii)使用多动作头DPO(MAH-DPO)和向量化奖励进行多目标对齐；(iii)提供细粒度推理时用户控制。

Result: 在数学推理、价值对齐和多轮对话实验中，该框架同时提升多个目标性能，最小化跨目标权衡，并实现灵活的推理时用户控制。

Conclusion: MAH-DPO框架有效解决了多目标强化学习中的目标冲突问题，为LLM的多维对齐提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: Aligning large language models to human preferences is inherently
multidimensional, yet most pipelines collapse heterogeneous signals into a
single optimizeable objective. We seek to answer what it would take to
simultaneously align a model across various domains spanning those with:
verifiable rewards (mathematical accuracy), non-verifiable subjective
preferences (human values), and complex interactive scenarios (multi-turn AI
tutoring dialogues). Such multi-objective reinforcement learning setups are
often plagued by the individual objectives being at odds with each other,
resulting in inefficient training and little user control during inference. We
propose a unified framework that: (i) standardizes {process reward model} (PRM)
training across both verifiable and non-verifiable settings to better supervise
models' chain-of-thought reasoning; (ii) performs {multi-objective alignment}
by training the LLM with our $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{A}$ction-$\textbf{H}$ead
$\textbf{DPO}$ (MAH-DPO) and a vectorized reward where the dimensions of the
vector correspond to the various objectives instead of a single scalar; and
(iii) demonstrates how such a system provides fine-grained inference-time user
control. Experiments across math reasoning, value alignment, and multi-turn
dialogue show that our framework improves performance across multiple
objectives simultaneously, while minimizing cross-objective trade-offs and
enabling flexible inference time user control. The code can be found at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出MA-SCLUCB算法，在多智能体网络环境中解决带阶段保守约束的随机线性赌博机问题，确保每个阶段的期望奖励不低于基线策略的(1-α)倍，同时实现接近最优的遗憾界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在推荐系统等实际应用中，多个学习智能体需要在保证安全约束（避免灾难性失败）的同时平衡探索与利用。现有研究缺乏对多智能体网络环境下阶段保守约束的考虑。

Method: 提出MA-SCLUCB算法，采用交替执行动作选择和共识构建阶段的方式。智能体仅与直接邻居通信，网络优化全局参数（局部参数的平均值）。

Result: 算法以高概率实现遗憾界$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d}{\sqrt{N}}\sqrt{T}\cdot\frac{\log(NT)}{\sqrt{\log(1/|\lambda_2|)}}\right)$，其中d是维度，T是时间范围，|λ₂|是网络第二大特征值幅度。

Conclusion: 分布式学习在合理连接的网络中可实现接近最优性能，协作带来1/√N的改进，通信开销仅对数增长，阶段安全约束仅增加低阶遗憾。

Abstract: In many real-world applications such as recommendation systems, multiple
learning agents must balance exploration and exploitation while maintaining
safety guarantees to avoid catastrophic failures. We study the stochastic
linear bandit problem in a multi-agent networked setting where agents must
satisfy stage-wise conservative constraints. A network of $N$ agents
collaboratively maximizes cumulative reward while ensuring that the expected
reward at every round is no less than $(1-\alpha)$ times that of a baseline
policy. Each agent observes local rewards with unknown parameters, but the
network optimizes for the global parameter (average of local parameters).
Agents communicate only with immediate neighbors, and each communication round
incurs additional regret. We propose MA-SCLUCB (Multi-Agent Stage-wise
Conservative Linear UCB), an episodic algorithm alternating between action
selection and consensus-building phases. We prove that MA-SCLUCB achieves
regret
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d}{\sqrt{N}}\sqrt{T}\cdot\frac{\log(NT)}{\sqrt{\log(1/|\lambda_2|)}}\right)$
with high probability, where $d$ is the dimension, $T$ is the horizon, and
$|\lambda_2|$ is the network's second largest eigenvalue magnitude. Our
analysis shows: (i) collaboration yields $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$ improvement
despite local communication, (ii) communication overhead grows only
logarithmically for well-connected networks, and (iii) stage-wise safety adds
only lower-order regret. Thus, distributed learning with safety guarantees
achieves near-optimal performance in reasonably connected networks.

TL;DR: FAME是一个端到端的函数对函数回归框架，通过双向神经控制微分方程和专家混合机制处理无限维函数数据，实现连续注意力机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 函数数据在科学和工程中很重要，但无限维特性使表示学习困难。传统统计模型依赖预设基展开或核函数，深度学习则常将函数视为固定网格向量，忽略了连续性。

Method: FAME结合双向神经控制微分方程和专家混合驱动的向量场来捕捉函数内连续性，通过多头交叉注意力融合函数间依赖关系。

Result: 在合成和真实世界函数回归基准测试中，FAME实现了最先进的准确性，对任意采样的离散函数观测具有强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FAME提供了一个完全数据驱动的函数对函数回归框架，能有效处理函数数据的无限维特性和连续性要求。

Abstract: Functional data play a pivotal role across science and engineering, yet their
infinite-dimensional nature makes representation learning challenging.
Conventional statistical models depend on pre-chosen basis expansions or
kernels, limiting the flexibility of data-driven discovery, while many
deep-learning pipelines treat functions as fixed-grid vectors, ignoring
inherent continuity. In this paper, we introduce Functional Attention with a
Mixture-of-Experts (FAME), an end-to-end, fully data-driven framework for
function-on-function regression. FAME forms continuous attention by coupling a
bidirectional neural controlled differential equation with MoE-driven vector
fields to capture intra-functional continuity, and further fuses change to
inter-functional dependencies via multi-head cross attention. Extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world functional-regression benchmarks show
that FAME achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, strong robustness to arbitrarily
sampled discrete observations of functions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源社区在LLM智能体开发中面临高质量、多样化工具-智能体训练数据的短缺，现有数据集在多样性、真实性和复杂性方面存在局限，特别是多工具和多轮交互场景。

Method: 使用5个不同模型生成多样化工具使用查询，经过质量过滤后，用3个教师模型和2个智能体框架生成轨迹，采用规则和模型双重验证，并引入3种扩展机制来增强任务多样性和模拟多轮对话。

Result: 在Toucan上微调的模型在BFCL V3基准测试中超越了更大的闭源模型，并在MCP-Universe Bench上推进了帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: Toucan数据集通过真实MCP环境生成多样化、真实且具有挑战性的任务轨迹，有效解决了开源工具-智能体训练数据不足的问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are rapidly emerging as powerful systems
for automating tasks across domains. Yet progress in the open-source community
is constrained by the lack of high quality permissively licensed tool-agentic
training data. Existing datasets are often limited in diversity, realism, and
complexity, particularly regarding multi-tool and multi-turn interactions. To
address this gap, we introduce Toucan, the largest publicly available
tool-agentic dataset to date, containing 1.5 million trajectories synthesized
from nearly 500 real-world Model Context Protocols (MCPs). Unlike prior work,
Toucan leverages authentic MCP environments to generate diverse, realistic, and
challenging tasks with trajectories involving real tool execution. Our pipeline
first produces a broad spectrum of tool-use queries using five distinct models,
applies model-based quality filtering, and then generates agentic trajectories
with three teacher models using two agentic frameworks. Rigorous rule-based and
model-based validation ensures high-quality outputs. We also introduce three
extension mechanisms to further diversify tasks and simulate multi-turn
conversations. Models fine-tuned on Toucan outperform larger closed-source
counterparts on the BFCL V3 benchmark and push the Pareto frontier forward on
MCP-Universe Bench.

TL;DR: EF21-Muon是首个具有严格收敛保证的通信高效、非欧几里得LMO优化器，支持随机梯度、动量和双向压缩，在NanoGPT基准测试中相比未压缩方法节省高达7倍通信量且无精度损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Muon、Scion和Gluon等优化器虽然通过利用层式线性最小化预言器在非欧几里得范数球上推进了大规模深度学习，但缺乏原则性的分布式框架，通信瓶颈未解决，现有分布式变体都是启发式且无收敛保证。

Method: 提出EF21-Muon，结合误差反馈的双向压缩技术，支持随机梯度、动量，覆盖非欧几里得光滑性和更一般的(L^0, L^1)-光滑设置，并扩展到层式广义光滑性机制以捕捉深度网络的各向异性结构。

Result: EF21-Muon在压缩关闭且选择特定范数时恢复Muon/Scion/Gluon，提供了该强大家族的首个高效分布式实现，在NanoGPT基准测试中相比未压缩方法实现高达7倍的通信节省且无精度下降。

Conclusion: EF21-Muon是首个具有严格收敛保证的通信高效非欧几里得LMO优化器，匹配最佳已知欧几里得速率，在合适范数选择下实现更快收敛，成功解决了该优化器家族的分布式实现问题。

Abstract: Recent optimizers like Muon, Scion, and Gluon have pushed the frontier of
large-scale deep learning by exploiting layer-wise linear minimization oracles
(LMOs) over non-Euclidean norm balls, capturing neural network structure in
ways traditional algorithms cannot. Yet, no principled distributed framework
exists for these methods, and communication bottlenecks remain unaddressed. The
very few distributed variants are heuristic, with no convergence guarantees in
sight. We introduce EF21-Muon, the first communication-efficient, non-Euclidean
LMO-based optimizer with rigorous convergence guarantees. EF21-Muon supports
stochastic gradients, momentum, and bidirectional compression with error
feedback-marking the first extension of error feedback beyond the Euclidean
setting. It recovers Muon/Scion/Gluon when compression is off and specific
norms are chosen, providing the first efficient distributed implementation of
this powerful family. Our theory covers non-Euclidean smooth and the more
general $(L^0, L^1)$-smooth setting, matching best-known Euclidean rates and
enabling faster convergence under suitable norm choices. We further extend the
analysis to layer-wise (generalized) smoothness regimes, capturing the
anisotropic structure of deep networks. Experiments on NanoGPT benchmarking
EF21-Muon against uncompressed Muon/Scion/Gluon demonstrate up to $7\times$
communication savings with no accuracy degradation.

Motivation: 现有ProRL方法通过增加训练步数来扩展强化学习，但在数千步后性能达到平台期，存在明显的收益递减。需要探索互补的扩展范式来突破这一限制。

Method: 采用BroRL方法，将每个示例的rollout数量增加到数百个，进行广泛探索。基于质量平衡方程分析，理论证明随着rollout数量增加，未采样项的影响会减弱，确保正确token概率质量的扩展。

Result: BroRL成功复活了在3K步ProRL训练后饱和的模型，展现出稳健的持续改进，在1.5B模型上跨多个基准测试达到了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 增加rollout数量是扩展强化学习的一个有效互补范式，能够突破训练步数扩展的性能饱和限制，实现持续的模型性能提升。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key
ingredient for unlocking complex reasoning capabilities in large language
models. Recent work ProRL has shown promise in scaling RL by increasing the
number of training steps. However, performance plateaus after thousands of
steps, with clear diminishing returns from allocating more computation to
additional training. In this work, we investigate a complementary paradigm for
scaling RL, BroR-Lincreasing the number of rollouts per example to hundreds to
exhaustively Broaden exploration, which yields continuous performance gains
beyond the saturation point observed in ProRL when scaling the number of
training steps. Our approach is motivated by a mass balance equation analysis
allowing us to characterize the rate of change in probability mass for correct
and incorrect tokens during the reinforcement process. We show that under a
one-step RL assumption, sampled rollout tokens always contribute to
correct-mass expansion, while unsampled tokens outside rollouts may lead to
gains or losses depending on their distribution and the net reward balance.
Importantly, as the number of rollouts per example N increases, the effect of
unsampled terms diminishes, ensuring overall correct-mass expansion. To
validate our theoretical analysis, we conduct simulations under more relaxed
conditions and find that a sufficiently large rollout size N-corresponding to
ample exploration-guarantees an increase in the probability mass of all correct
tokens. Empirically, BroRL revives models saturated after 3K ProRL training
steps and demonstrates robust, continuous improvement, achieving
state-of-the-art results for the 1.5B model across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: 在数字发展干预文档分类中，除了数据量外，还需要考虑类内相似性和类间差异性特征，One vs Rest组合模型方法能够优化多分类任务的性能。

Abstract: Automated document classification is a trending topic in Natural Language
Processing (NLP) due to the extensive growth in digital databases. However, a
model that fits well for a specific classification task might perform weakly
for another dataset due to differences in the context. Thus, training and
evaluating several models is necessary to optimise the results. This study
employs a publicly available document database on worldwide digital development
interventions categorised under twelve areas. Since digital interventions are
still emerging, utilising NLP in the field is relatively new. Given the
exponential growth of digital interventions, this research has a vast scope for
improving how digital-development-oriented organisations report their work. The
paper examines the classification performance of Machine Learning (ML)
algorithms, including Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector
Machine, AdaBoost, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Naive Bayes, and Logistic
Regression. Accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score are utilised to evaluate
the performance of these models, while oversampling is used to address the
class-imbalanced nature of the dataset. Deviating from the traditional approach
of fitting a single model for multiclass classification, this paper
investigates the One vs Rest approach to build a combined model that optimises
the performance. The study concludes that the amount of data is not the sole
factor affecting the performance; features like similarity within classes and
dissimilarity among classes are also crucial.

Conclusion: DeepFHT成功地将随机过程理论与深度学习相结合，为复杂系统中的生存现象建模提供了原则性方法，在保持预测准确性的同时增强了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: We introduce DeepFHT, a survival-analysis framework that couples deep neural
networks with first hitting time (FHT) distributions from stochastic process
theory. Time to event is represented as the first passage of a latent diffusion
process to an absorbing boundary. A neural network maps input variables to
physically meaningful parameters including initial condition, drift, and
diffusion, within a chosen FHT process such as Brownian motion, both with drift
and driftless. This yields closed-form survival and hazard functions and
captures time-varying risk without assuming proportional-hazards.
  We compare DeepFHT with Cox regression and other existing parametric survival
models, using synthetic and real-world datasets. The method achieves predictive
accuracy on par with state-of-the-art approaches, while maintaining a
physics-based interpretable parameterization that elucidates the relation
between input features and risk. This combination of stochastic process theory
and deep learning provides a principled avenue for modeling survival phenomena
in complex systems.

Conclusion: TD-JEPA通过时间差分学习实现了有效的潜在预测表示学习，能够捕获长期策略动态的低秩分解，并在潜在空间中恢复后继特征，为无监督强化学习提供了强大的框架。

Abstract: Latent prediction--where agents learn by predicting their own latents--has
emerged as a powerful paradigm for training general representations in machine
learning. In reinforcement learning (RL), this approach has been explored to
define auxiliary losses for a variety of settings, including reward-based and
unsupervised RL, behavior cloning, and world modeling. While existing methods
are typically limited to single-task learning, one-step prediction, or
on-policy trajectory data, we show that temporal difference (TD) learning
enables learning representations predictive of long-term latent dynamics across
multiple policies from offline, reward-free transitions. Building on this, we
introduce TD-JEPA, which leverages TD-based latent-predictive representations
into unsupervised RL. TD-JEPA trains explicit state and task encoders, a
policy-conditioned multi-step predictor, and a set of parameterized policies
directly in latent space. This enables zero-shot optimization of any reward
function at test time. Theoretically, we show that an idealized variant of
TD-JEPA avoids collapse with proper initialization, and learns encoders that
capture a low-rank factorization of long-term policy dynamics, while the
predictor recovers their successor features in latent space. Empirically,
TD-JEPA matches or outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on locomotion,
navigation, and manipulation tasks across 13 datasets in ExoRL and OGBench,
especially in the challenging setting of zero-shot RL from pixels.

Result: 时间序列基础模型的零样本能力受预训练领域影响显著，微调后性能提升有限，且参数效率不如专用模型。

Abstract: Foundation Models are designed to serve as versatile embedding machines, with
strong zero shot capabilities and superior generalization performance when
fine-tuned on diverse downstream tasks. While this is largely true for language
and vision foundation models, we argue that the inherent diversity of time
series data makes them less suited for building effective foundation models. We
demonstrate this using forecasting as our downstream task. We show that the
zero-shot capabilities of a time series foundation model are significantly
influenced and tied to the specific domains it has been pretrained on.
Furthermore, when applied to unseen real-world time series data, fine-tuned
foundation models do not consistently yield substantially better results,
relative to their increased parameter count and memory footprint, than smaller,
dedicated models tailored to the specific forecasting task at hand.

Conclusion: LEAP编码作为图表示学习流水线中的强大组件具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) largely rely on the message-passing paradigm,
where nodes iteratively aggregate information from their neighbors. Yet,
standard message passing neural networks (MPNNs) face well-documented
theoretical and practical limitations. Graph positional encoding (PE) has
emerged as a promising direction to address these limitations. The Euler
Characteristic Transform (ECT) is an efficiently computable
geometric-topological invariant that characterizes shapes and graphs. In this
work, we combine the differentiable approximation of the ECT (DECT) and its
local variant ($\ell$-ECT) to propose LEAP, a new end-to-end trainable local
structural PE for graphs. We evaluate our approach on multiple real-world
datasets as well as on a synthetic task designed to test its ability to extract
topological features. Our results underline the potential of LEAP-based
encodings as a powerful component for graph representation learning pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM遗忘方法在权重量化或微调等后处理操作下容易失效，需要提高遗忘效果的鲁棒性。

Method: 分析不同阶数优化器（零阶、一阶、二阶）对遗忘鲁棒性的影响，提出结合一阶和零阶更新的混合优化器。

Result: 实验表明降级优化器能产生更鲁棒的遗忘效果，混合优化器在保持遗忘效果的同时显著提升鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 优化器选择是影响LLM遗忘鲁棒性的关键因素，降级优化器策略能有效抵抗后训练扰动。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning aims to surgically remove the influence
of undesired data or knowledge from an existing model while preserving its
utility on unrelated tasks. This paradigm has shown promise in addressing
privacy and safety concerns. However, recent findings reveal that unlearning
effects are often fragile: post-unlearning manipulations such as weight
quantization or fine-tuning can quickly neutralize the intended forgetting.
Prior efforts to improve robustness primarily reformulate unlearning objectives
by explicitly assuming the role of vulnerability sources. In this work, we take
a different perspective by investigating the role of the optimizer, independent
of unlearning objectives and formulations, in shaping unlearning robustness. We
show that the 'grade' of the optimizer, defined by the level of information it
exploits, ranging from zeroth-order (gradient-free) to first-order
(gradient-based) to second-order (Hessian-based), is tightly linked to the
resilience of unlearning. Surprisingly, we find that downgrading the optimizer,
such as using zeroth-order methods or compressed-gradient variants (e.g.,
gradient sign-based optimizers), often leads to stronger robustness. While
these optimizers produce noisier and less precise updates, they encourage
convergence to harder-to-disturb basins in the loss landscape, thereby
resisting post-training perturbations. By connecting zeroth-order methods with
randomized smoothing, we further highlight their natural advantage for robust
unlearning. Motivated by these insights, we propose a hybrid optimizer that
combines first-order and zeroth-order updates, preserving unlearning efficacy
while enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments on the MUSE and WMDP
benchmarks, across multiple LLM unlearning algorithms, validate that our
approach achieves more resilient forgetting without sacrificing unlearning
quality.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的交互范式——原位反馈，用户直接编辑LLM的先前响应，模型基于修改后的响应生成修订，相比传统多轮反馈性能更好且节省79.1%的token。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反馈范式依赖发布新消息，LLM难以可靠整合这些反馈，导致改进不一致。需要更有效的机制来指导LLM在复杂推理任务中的表现。

Method: 引入原位反馈范式，用户直接编辑模型先前响应，模型基于修改后的响应生成修订，而非传统多轮对话方式。

Result: 在多样化推理密集型基准测试中，原位反馈比传统多轮反馈性能更好，同时减少79.1%的token使用。模型能更精确地应用反馈到错误部分。

Conclusion: 原位反馈为引导LLM在推理密集型任务中提供了更自然有效的机制，解决了多轮反馈的核心限制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly studied in the context of
multi-turn reasoning, where models iteratively refine their outputs based on
user-provided feedback. Such settings are crucial for tasks that require
complex reasoning, yet existing feedback paradigms often rely on issuing new
messages. LLMs struggle to integrate these reliably, leading to inconsistent
improvements. In this work, we introduce in-place feedback, a novel interaction
paradigm in which users directly edit an LLM's previous response, and the model
conditions on this modified response to generate its revision. Empirical
evaluations on diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks reveal that in-place
feedback achieves better performance than conventional multi-turn feedback
while using $79.1\%$ fewer tokens. Complementary analyses on controlled
environments further demonstrate that in-place feedback resolves a core
limitation of multi-turn feedback: models often fail to apply feedback
precisely to erroneous parts of the response, leaving errors uncorrected and
sometimes introducing new mistakes into previously correct content. These
findings suggest that in-place feedback offers a more natural and effective
mechanism for guiding LLMs in reasoning-intensive tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一个在复杂系统中高效探索用户感兴趣区域内模式多样性的方法，通过系统无关的约束条件来引导探索过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂系统产生的模式多样性对科学和艺术应用很有价值，但参数空间巨大且参数与模式之间存在强非线性映射关系，加上用户通常对特定模式有期望，这使得探索过程面临挑战。

Method: 通过设计选择和实现，使用户能够以系统无关的方式表达约束条件，在用户感兴趣区域内最大化模式多样性，同时保持全局多样性。

Result: 实现了在样本效率高的方式下发现约束多样性的能力，支持交互式系统探索。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决复杂系统探索中的挑战，在考虑用户期望的同时最大化模式多样性。

Abstract: The diversity of patterns that emerge from complex systems motivates their
use for scientific or artistic purposes. When exploring these systems, the
challenges faced are the size of the parameter space and the strongly
non-linear mapping between parameters and emerging patterns. In addition,
artists and scientists who explore complex systems do so with an expectation of
particular patterns. Taking these expectations into account adds a new set of
challenges, which the exploration process must address. We provide design
choices and their implementation to address these challenges; enabling the
maximization of the diversity of patterns discovered in the user's region of
interest -- which we call the constrained diversity -- in a sample-efficient
manner. The region of interest is expressed in the form of explicit
constraints. These constraints are formulated by the user in a system-agnostic
way, and their addition enables interactive system exploration leading to
constrained diversity, while maintaining global diversity.

Motivation: 化学空间的高效探索仍然是一个核心挑战，许多生成模型仍会产生不稳定或不可合成的化合物。为了解决这些限制，需要开发能够生成更稳定和可合成分子的方法。

Method: EvoMol-RL将强化学习集成到EvoMol进化算法中，利用扩展连接性指纹（ECFPs）学习上下文感知的突变策略，优先考虑化学上合理的转化。

Conclusion: 结合强化学习和分子指纹生成化学相关分子结构的有效性得到了验证，EvoMol-RL为化学空间探索提供了更可靠的方法。

Abstract: The efficient exploration of chemical space remains a central challenge, as
many generative models still produce unstable or non-synthesizable compounds.
To address these limitations, we present EvoMol-RL, a significant extension of
the EvoMol evolutionary algorithm that integrates reinforcement learning to
guide molecular mutations based on local structural context. By leveraging
Extended Connectivity Fingerprints (ECFPs), EvoMol-RL learns context-aware
mutation policies that prioritize chemically plausible transformations. This
approach significantly improves the generation of valid and realistic
molecules, reducing the frequency of structural artifacts and enhancing
optimization performance. The results demonstrate that EvoMol-RL consistently
outperforms its baseline in molecular pre-filtering realism. These results
emphasize the effectiveness of combining reinforcement learning with molecular
fingerprints to generate chemically relevant molecular structures.

Method: 提出两阶段算法：首先进行子空间估计识别低维结构，然后在估计子空间导出的紧凑维度表示中使用线性bandit算法。

Result: 算法在任意时间范围T上实现了$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$的累积遗憾，实验验证其在线性bandit基线上在累积遗憾和运行时间方面都有显著优势。

Conclusion: 该工作建立了社交媒体平台算法干预与多臂bandit理论之间的关键联系，为在线社交网络干预提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We study the problem of minimizing polarization and disagreement in the
Friedkin-Johnsen opinion dynamics model under incomplete information. Unlike
prior work that assumes a static setting with full knowledge of users' innate
opinions, we address the more realistic online setting where innate opinions
are unknown and must be learned through sequential observations. This novel
setting, which naturally mirrors periodic interventions on social media
platforms, is formulated as a regret minimization problem, establishing a key
connection between algorithmic interventions on social media platforms and
theory of multi-armed bandits. In our formulation, a learner observes only a
scalar feedback of the overall polarization and disagreement after an
intervention. For this novel bandit problem, we propose a two-stage algorithm
based on low-rank matrix bandits. The algorithm first performs subspace
estimation to identify an underlying low-dimensional structure, and then
employs a linear bandit algorithm within the compact dimensional representation
derived from the estimated subspace. We prove that our algorithm achieves an $
\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) $ cumulative regret over any time horizon $T$.
Empirical results validate that our algorithm significantly outperforms a
linear bandit baseline in terms of both cumulative regret and running time.

Motivation: 现有GFlowNets采样策略在大型搜索空间中倾向于过度探索，难以持续生成高奖励样本，特别是在奖励稀疏区域。需要在保持多样性的前提下提高高奖励样本的生成概率。

Method: 集成增强的MCTS到GFlowNets采样过程，使用MCTS进行策略评估引导高奖励轨迹生成，采用PUCT算法自适应平衡探索与利用，并引入可控贪婪度调节机制。

Conclusion: 通过动态平衡探索和奖励驱动引导，该方法在增强利用性的同时不牺牲多样性，有效解决了GFlowNets在大型稀疏奖励空间中的采样挑战。

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have emerged as a powerful tool for
generating diverse and high-reward structured objects by learning to sample
from a distribution proportional to a given reward function. Unlike
conventional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches that prioritize
optimization of a single trajectory, GFlowNets seek to balance diversity and
reward by modeling the entire trajectory distribution. This capability makes
them especially suitable for domains such as molecular design and combinatorial
optimization. However, existing GFlowNets sampling strategies tend to
overexplore and struggle to consistently generate high-reward samples,
particularly in large search spaces with sparse high-reward regions. Therefore,
improving the probability of generating high-reward samples without sacrificing
diversity remains a key challenge under this premise. In this work, we
integrate an enhanced Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into the GFlowNets
sampling process, using MCTS-based policy evaluation to guide the generation
toward high-reward trajectories and Polynomial Upper Confidence Trees (PUCT) to
balance exploration and exploitation adaptively, and we introduce a
controllable mechanism to regulate the degree of greediness. Our method
enhances exploitation without sacrificing diversity by dynamically balancing
exploration and reward-driven guidance. The experimental results show that our
method can not only accelerate the speed of discovering high-reward regions but
also continuously generate high-reward samples, while preserving the diversity
of the generative distribution. All implementations are available at

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have shown promising zero-shot
generalization across diverse forecasting tasks. However, their robustness to
continual adaptation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate the
extent to which TSFMs suffer from catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuned
sequentially on multiple datasets. Using synthetic datasets designed with
varying degrees of periodic structure, we measure the trade-off between
adaptation to new data and retention of prior knowledge. Our experiments reveal
that, while fine-tuning improves performance on new tasks, it often causes
significant degradation on previously learned ones, illustrating a fundamental
stability-plasticity dilemma.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种学习动态引导权重的方法，替代传统的静态权重CFG，通过最小化分布不匹配来改进条件扩散模型的采样质量和对齐度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CFG使用固定的引导权重，虽然能改善感知质量，但会导致分布对齐变差。需要更灵活的权重调整机制来更好地近似目标条件分布。

Method: 学习连续函数形式的引导权重ωc,(s,t)，作为条件c、起始时间t和目标时间s的函数。通过最小化真实条件分布与引导扩散过程样本间的分布不匹配来实现。

Result: 在低维玩具示例和高维图像生成中，该方法改进了FID分数。在文生图应用中，使用CLIP分数作为奖励函数能改善图像-提示对齐。

Conclusion: 动态学习的引导权重比静态权重能更好地平衡感知质量和分布对齐，在奖励引导采样框架下可进一步优化特定目标。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique for improving the
perceptual quality of samples from conditional diffusion models. It operates by
linearly combining conditional and unconditional score estimates using a
guidance weight $\omega$. While a large, static weight can markedly improve
visual results, this often comes at the cost of poorer distributional
alignment. In order to better approximate the target conditional distribution,
we instead learn guidance weights $\omega_{c,(s,t)}$, which are continuous
functions of the conditioning $c$, the time $t$ from which we denoise, and the
time $s$ towards which we denoise. We achieve this by minimizing the
distributional mismatch between noised samples from the true conditional
distribution and samples from the guided diffusion process. We extend our
framework to reward guided sampling, enabling the model to target distributions
tilted by a reward function $R(x_0,c)$, defined on clean data and a
conditioning $c$. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology on
low-dimensional toy examples and high-dimensional image settings, where we
observe improvements in Fr\'echet inception distance (FID) for image
generation. In text-to-image applications, we observe that employing a reward
function given by the CLIP score leads to guidance weights that improve
image-prompt alignment.

Conclusion: CAPO通过曲率感知优化提供了单调改进保证，能够实现更高效的LLM推理训练，释放可扩展的后训练潜力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning, particularly through policy gradient methods, has
played a central role in enabling reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models. However, the optimization stability of policy gradients in this setting
remains understudied. As a result, existing implementations often resort to
conservative hyperparameter choices to ensure stability, which requires more
training samples and increases computational costs. Hence, developing models
for reliably tracking the underlying optimization dynamics and leveraging them
into training enables more sample-efficient regimes and further unleashes
scalable post-training. We address this gap by formalizing the stochastic
optimization problem of policy gradients with explicit consideration of
second-order geometry. We propose a tractable computational framework that
tracks and leverages curvature information during policy updates. We further
employ this framework to design interventions in the optimization process
through data selection. The resultant algorithm, Curvature-Aware Policy
Optimization (CAPO), identifies samples that contribute to unstable updates and
masks them out. Theoretically, we establish monotonic improvement guarantees
under realistic assumptions. On standard math reasoning benchmarks, we
empirically show that CAPO ensures stable updates under aggressive learning
regimes where baselines catastrophically fail. With minimal intervention
(rejecting fewer than 8% of tokens), CAPO achieves up to 30x improvement in
sample efficiency over standard GRPO for LLM reasoning.

Abstract: We study LLM routing, the problem of selecting the best model for each query
while balancing user satisfaction, model expertise, and inference cost. We
formulate routing as contextual dueling bandits, learning from pairwise
preference feedback rather than absolute scores, thereby yielding
label-efficient and dynamic adaptation. Building on this formulation, we
introduce Category-Calibrated Fine-Tuning (CCFT), a representation-learning
method that derives model embeddings from offline data using contrastive
fine-tuning with categorical weighting. These embeddings enable the practical
instantiation of Feel-Good Thompson Sampling for Contextual Dueling Bandits
(FGTS.CDB), a theoretically grounded posterior-sampling algorithm. We propose
four variants of the categorical weighting that explicitly integrate model
quality and cost, and we empirically evaluate the proposed methods on the
RouterBench and MixInstruct datasets. Across both benchmarks, our methods
achieve lower cumulative regret and faster convergence, with better robustness
and performance-cost balance than strong baselines built with a general-purpose
OpenAI embedding model.

Abstract: This paper presents a population synthesis model that utilizes the
Wasserstein Generative-Adversarial Network (WGAN) for training on incomplete
microsamples. By using a mask matrix to represent missing values, the study
proposes a WGAN training algorithm that lets the model learn from a training
dataset that has some missing information. The proposed method aims to address
the challenge of missing information in microsamples on one or more attributes
due to privacy concerns or data collection constraints. The paper contrasts
WGAN models trained on incomplete microsamples with those trained on complete
microsamples, creating a synthetic population. We conducted a series of
evaluations of the proposed method using a Swedish national travel survey. We
validate the efficacy of the proposed method by generating synthetic
populations from all the models and comparing them to the actual population
dataset. The results from the experiments showed that the proposed methodology
successfully generates synthetic data that closely resembles a model trained
with complete data as well as the actual population. The paper contributes to
the field by providing a robust solution for population synthesis with

Conclusion: CT-GAN是目标人口生成的有效方法，深度生成模型可以成功与传统合成技术集成以提升性能。

Abstract: Agent-based models used in scenario planning for transportation and urban
planning usually require detailed population information from the base as well
as target scenarios. These populations are usually provided by synthesizing
fake agents through deterministic population synthesis methods. However, these
deterministic population synthesis methods face several challenges, such as
handling high-dimensional data, scalability, and zero-cell issues, particularly
when generating populations for target scenarios. This research looks into how
a deep generative model called Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial
Network (CT-GAN) can be used to create target populations either directly from
a collection of marginal constraints or through a hybrid method that combines
CT-GAN with Fitness-based Synthesis Combinatorial Optimization (FBS-CO). The
research evaluates the proposed population synthesis models against travel
survey and zonal-level aggregated population data. Results indicate that the
stand-alone CT-GAN model performs the best when compared with FBS-CO and the
hybrid model. CT-GAN by itself can create realistic-looking groups that match
single-variable distributions, but it struggles to maintain relationships
between multiple variables. However, the hybrid model demonstrates improved
performance compared to FBS-CO by leveraging CT-GAN ability to generate a
descriptive base population, which is then refined using FBS-CO to align with
target-year marginals. This study demonstrates that CT-GAN represents an
effective methodology for target populations and highlights how deep generative
models can be successfully integrated with conventional synthesis techniques to
enhance their performance.

Abstract: High-quality data is a prerequisite for training reliable Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models in the energy domain. In district heating networks,
sensor and metering data often suffer from noise, missing values, and temporal
inconsistencies, which can significantly degrade model performance. This paper
presents a systematic approach for evaluating and improving data quality using
visual diagnostics, implemented through an interactive web-based dashboard. The
dashboard employs Python-based visualization techniques, including time series
plots, heatmaps, box plots, histograms, correlation matrices, and
anomaly-sensitive KPIs such as skewness and anomaly detection based on the
modified z-scores. These tools al-low human experts to inspect and interpret
data anomalies, enabling a human-in-the-loop strategy for data quality
assessment. The methodology is demonstrated on a real-world dataset from a
Danish district heating provider, covering over four years of hourly data from
nearly 7000 meters. The findings show how visual analytics can uncover systemic
data issues and, in the future, guide data cleaning strategies that enhance the
accuracy, stability, and generalizability of Long Short-Term Memory and Gated
Recurrent Unit models for heat demand forecasting. The study contributes to a
scalable, generalizable framework for visual data inspection and underlines the
critical role of data quality in AI-driven energy management systems.

quality of low-amplitude signals, such as gravitational events. A pre-existing
autoencoder was trained using cosmic event data, optimizing its architecture
and parameters. The results show a significant increase in the signal-to-noise
ratio of the processed signals, demonstrating the potential of autoencoders in
the analysis of small signals with multiple sources of interference.

TL;DR: GreenLightningAI (GLAI) 是一种新的架构模块，通过分离结构知识和定量知识来替代传统MLP，在保持通用逼近能力的同时减少约40%的训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MLP在训练过程中将结构知识和定量知识纠缠在一起，导致训练效率低下。GLAI旨在分离这两种知识以实现更高效的训练过程。

Method: GLAI将MLP重新表述为路径组合，固定稳定后的结构（由ReLU激活模式决定），仅优化定量组件（权重和偏置）。

Result: 在多种实验设置中，GLAI始终匹配或超过具有相同参数数量的MLP的准确率，同时收敛速度更快，平均训练时间减少约40%。

Conclusion: GLAI确立了一个新的设计原则，为未来集成到大规模架构（如Transformer）中开辟了方向，其中MLP块占据了计算开销的主要部分。

Abstract: In this work we introduce GreenLightningAI (GLAI), a new architectural block
designed as an alternative to conventional MLPs. The central idea is to
separate two types of knowledge that are usually entangled during training: (i)
*structural knowledge*, encoded by the stable activation patterns induced by
ReLU activations; and (ii) *quantitative knowledge*, carried by the numerical
weights and biases. By fixing the structure once stabilized, GLAI reformulates
the MLP as a combination of paths, where only the quantitative component is
optimized. This reformulation retains the universal approximation capabilities
of MLPs, yet achieves a more efficient training process, reducing training time
by ~40% on average across the cases examined in this study. Crucially, GLAI is
not just another classifier, but a generic block that can replace MLPs wherever
they are used, from supervised heads with frozen backbones to projection layers
in self-supervised learning or few-shot classifiers. Across diverse
experimental setups, GLAI consistently matches or exceeds the accuracy of MLPs
with an equivalent number of parameters, while converging faster. Overall, GLAI
establishes a new design principle that opens a direction for future
integration into large-scale architectures such as Transformers, where MLP
blocks dominate the computational footprint.

Motivation: 研究不同损失函数对基于价值的强化学习方法的影响，特别是比较平均绝对误差和均方误差在控制策略次优性差距方面的表现。

Method: 通过理论分析预测目标，比较不同损失函数（交叉熵损失和平方损失）与回归目标（平均绝对误差和均方误差）的匹配程度，并在线性强化学习中进行实证验证。

Result: 理论证明平均绝对误差优于均方误差，交叉熵损失与平均绝对误差更匹配，在线性强化学习中基于交叉熵损失的算法表现更好。

Conclusion: 损失函数选择对强化学习性能有重要影响，交叉熵损失与平均绝对误差的组合在线性强化学习中具有优势。

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of the loss function in value-based
methods for reinforcement learning through an analysis of underlying prediction
objectives. We theoretically show that mean absolute error is a better
prediction objective than the traditional mean squared error for controlling
the learned policy's suboptimality gap. Furthermore, we present results that
different loss functions are better aligned with these different regression
objectives: binary and categorical cross-entropy losses with the mean absolute
error and squared loss with the mean squared error. We then provide empirical
evidence that algorithms minimizing these cross-entropy losses can outperform
those based on the squared loss in linear reinforcement learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基因表达数据特征选择对于提高分类性能和降低高维数据集计算成本至关重要，需要有效整合现有流行技术来优化特征空间

Method: 开发BoMGene混合方法，集成Boruta和mRMR两种特征选择技术，在25个公开基因表达数据集上使用SVM、随机森林、XGBoost和GBM分类器进行实验

Result: Boruta-mRMR组合相比单独使用mRMR减少了所选特征数量，加快了训练时间，同时保持甚至提高了分类准确率

Conclusion: 该方法在多类基因表达数据分析中展现出准确性、稳定性和实际应用性的明显优势

Abstract: Feature selection is a crucial step in analyzing gene expression data,
enhancing classification performance, and reducing computational costs for
high-dimensional datasets. This paper proposes BoMGene, a hybrid feature
selection method that effectively integrates two popular techniques: Boruta and
Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR). The method aims to optimize the
feature space and enhance classification accuracy. Experiments were conducted
on 25 publicly available gene expression datasets, employing widely used
classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, XGBoost (XGB),
and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM). The results show that using the
Boruta-mRMR combination cuts down the number of features chosen compared to
just using mRMR, which helps to speed up training time while keeping or even
improving classification accuracy compared to using individual feature
selection methods. The proposed approach demonstrates clear advantages in
accuracy, stability, and practical applicability for multi-class gene
expression data analysis

TL;DR: 提出了RiskPO方法，用风险度量替代传统的均值目标，通过混合风险价值目标增强梯度信号，防止熵崩溃，在数学推理、多模态推理和代码生成任务上显著优于GRPO方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于均值的强化学习方法（如GRPO）存在熵崩溃和推理能力提升有限的问题，原因是过度关注高概率输出序列而忽略了稀有但信息丰富的推理路径。

Method: 提出RiskPO方法，使用混合风险价值目标，对奖励分布的多个区域进行加权关注；设计捆绑方案将多个问题聚合，丰富反馈信号；理论证明风险规避更新能缓解熵崩溃并促进探索。

Result: 在数学推理、多模态推理和代码生成基准测试中，RiskPO在Pass@1和Pass@k指标上均一致且显著优于GRPO及其变体。

Conclusion: 基于风险的优化为增强LLM推理能力提供了一个严谨有效的范式。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable reward has recently emerged as a
central paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs); however,
prevailing mean-based methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), suffer from entropy collapse and limited reasoning gains. We argue that
these issues stem from overemphasizing high-probability output sequences while
neglecting rare but informative reasoning paths. To address these challenges,
we propose Risk-based Policy Optimization (RiskPO), which substitutes classical
mean-based objectives with principled risk measures. Specifically, we introduce
a Mixed Value-at-Risk objective that integrates weighted attention over
multiple regions of the reward distribution, thereby amplifying gradient
signals on challenging instances and preventing overconfident convergence. We
further design a bundling scheme that aggregates multiple questions into
bundles, thus enriching the feedback signal and yielding more stable and
informative training dynamics. Theoretically, we prove that the risk-averse
update alleviates entropy collapse and promotes exploration. Numerically,
RiskPO achieves consistent and significant improvements in mathematical
reasoning, multi-modal reasoning, and code generation benchmarks, surpassing
GRPO and its variants on both Pass@1 and Pass@k metrics. Our results
demonstrate that risk-based optimization provides a rigorous and effective
paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出两种校正算法来解决强化学习中验证器不可靠性问题：后向校正通过去偏观测二元奖励恢复无偏策略梯度估计，前向校正通过重加权分数函数项使更新方向与干净梯度对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决RLVR系统中验证器不可靠性导致的假阴性和假阳性问题，避免因验证器错误而影响策略训练效果。

Method: 将验证器建模为具有不对称噪声率的随机奖励通道，提出后向校正和前向校正两种算法，并在GRPO-based RLVR流水线中实现。

Result: 在数学推理模型和基准测试中，两种校正方法均优于未校正训练，前向校正收敛更快且在更重噪声下保持稳定。

Conclusion: 通过轻量级LLM验证器在线估计假阴性率，实现了优于其他最先进方法的性能，验证了校正算法的有效性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) trains policies against
automated verifiers to avoid costly human labeling. To reduce vulnerability to
verifier hacking, many RLVR systems collapse rewards to binary $\{0,1\}$ during
training. This choice carries a cost: it introduces \textit{false negatives}
(rejecting correct answers, FNs) and \textit{false positives} (accepting
incorrect ones, FPs). For instance, a rule-based checker may mark the correct
fraction $\frac{12}{36}$ as wrong when compared against the canonical
$\frac{1}{3}$ due to brittle parsing/equivalence rules (FN), while a large
language model (LLM) judges can be gamed by superficial cues or even a single
adversarial token, yielding inflated correctness for wrong solutions (FP). We
formalize verifier unreliability by modeling the verifier as a stochastic
reward channel with asymmetric noise rates. From this abstraction, we derive
two correction algorithms for verifier errors. The first is a \textit{backward}
correction that de-biases the observed binary reward to recover an
\textit{unbiased} estimator of the clean policy gradient. The second is a
\textit{forward} correction that reweights score-function terms so that the
expected update direction aligns with the \textit{clean gradient}; notably, it
requires only the FN rate. We implement both as lightweight hooks in a group
relative policy optimization (GRPO)-based RLVR pipeline and evaluate them on
math-reasoning models and benchmarks. Across models and datasets, both
corrections improve over uncorrected training; the forward variant converges
faster and remains stable under heavier noise. Finally, we show a practical
appeal mechanism in which a lightweight LLM verifier estimates the FN rate
online by rechecking rule-based negatives, obtaining outperformance compared
with other state-of-the-art contenders.

TL;DR: RECAP是一种通过强化学习的方法，训练大型推理模型在遇到有缺陷的前提时能够覆盖错误的推理轨迹，转向安全有用的响应，从而提升安全对齐和抗越狱能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在生成结构化思维链时缺乏对安全对齐的批判性推理能力，容易在有缺陷前提注入时产生偏见。

Method: 使用合成生成的反对齐思维链预填充和标准提示的混合数据进行强化学习训练，无需额外训练成本或对标准RLHF的修改。

Result: 显著提高了安全性和抗越狱鲁棒性，减少了过度拒绝，同时保持了核心推理能力，且不增加推理令牌预算。

Conclusion: RECAP训练后的模型更频繁地进行自我反思，在自适应攻击下保持鲁棒性，即使经过多次尝试覆盖其推理也能保持安全性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) "think" by generating structured
chain-of-thought (CoT) before producing a final answer, yet they still lack the
ability to reason critically about safety alignment and are easily biased when
a flawed premise is injected into their thought process. We propose RECAP
(Robust Safety Alignment via Counter-Aligned Prefilling), a principled
reinforcement learning (RL) method for post-training that explicitly teaches
models to override flawed reasoning trajectories and reroute to safe and
helpful responses. RECAP trains on a mixture of synthetically generated
counter-aligned CoT prefills and standard prompts, requires no additional
training cost or modifications beyond vanilla reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), and substantially improves safety and jailbreak robustness,
reduces overrefusal, and preserves core reasoning capability -- all while
maintaining inference token budget. Extensive analysis shows that RECAP-trained
models engage in self-reflection more frequently and remain robust under
adaptive attacks, preserving safety even after repeated attempts to override
their reasoning.

Conclusion: RCM成功地将一致性模型扩展到黎曼流形，为弯曲几何上的生成建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Consistency models are a class of generative models that enable few-step
generation for diffusion and flow matching models. While consistency models
have achieved promising results on Euclidean domains like images, their
applications to Riemannian manifolds remain challenging due to the curved
geometry. In this work, we propose the Riemannian Consistency Model (RCM),
which, for the first time, enables few-step consistency modeling while
respecting the intrinsic manifold constraint imposed by the Riemannian
geometry. Leveraging the covariant derivative and exponential-map-based
parameterization, we derive the closed-form solutions for both discrete- and
continuous-time training objectives for RCM. We then demonstrate theoretical
equivalence between the two variants of RCM: Riemannian consistency
distillation (RCD) that relies on a teacher model to approximate the marginal
vector field, and Riemannian consistency training (RCT) that utilizes the
conditional vector field for training. We further propose a simplified training
objective that eliminates the need for the complicated differential
calculation. Finally, we provide a unique kinematics perspective for
interpreting the RCM objective, offering new theoretical angles. Through
extensive experiments, we manifest the superior generative quality of RCM in
few-step generation on various non-Euclidean manifolds, including flat-tori,
spheres, and the 3D rotation group SO(3).

Conclusion: 这是第一个为错误约束逻辑测试提供无遗憾保证的方法，在医疗筛查等应用中具有直接价值，仿真验证了其理论保证和实际效率。

Abstract: We study the problem of sequentially testing individuals for a binary disease
outcome whose true risk is governed by an unknown logistic model. At each
round, a patient arrives with feature vector $x_t$, and the decision maker may
either pay to administer a (noiseless) diagnostic test--revealing the true
label--or skip testing and predict the patient's disease status based on their
feature vector and prior history. Our goal is to minimize the total number of
costly tests required while guaranteeing that the fraction of
misclassifications does not exceed a prespecified error tolerance $\alpha$,
with probability at least $1-\delta$. To address this, we develop a novel
algorithm that interleaves label-collection and distribution estimation to
estimate both $\theta^{*}$ and the context distribution $P$, and computes a
conservative, data-driven threshold $\tau_t$ on the logistic score
$|x_t^\top\theta|$ to decide when testing is necessary. We prove that, with
probability at least $1-\delta$, our procedure does not exceed the target
misclassification rate, and requires only $O(\sqrt{T})$ excess tests compared
to the oracle baseline that knows both $\theta^{*}$ and the patient feature
distribution $P$. This establishes the first no-regret guarantees for
error-constrained logistic testing, with direct applications to cost-sensitive
medical screening. Simulations corroborate our theoretical guarantees, showing
that in practice our procedure efficiently estimates $\theta^{*}$ while
retaining safety guarantees, and does not require too many excess tests.

Motivation: 研究观察到在查询提示前插入长序列无意义标记能持续提升LLM推理性能，这一令人困惑的现象需要机制性解释和更原则性的方法来获得类似性能提升。

Method: 提出激活重分布模块(ARM)，这是一种轻量级推理时技术，无需改变输入序列，直接修改激活。ARM自适应识别非线性函数后的近零激活并将其向外移动，以可控方式重现无意义标记的有益效果。

Result: 在多样化基准测试和模型架构上的广泛实验表明，ARM能持续提升LLM在推理任务上的性能，且只需几行简单代码即可实现。

Conclusion: 研究不仅为无意义标记的意外益处提供了清晰的机制解释，还提出了一种简单有效的技术，利用激活重分布来进一步提升LLM性能。

Abstract: Motivated by the puzzling observation that inserting long sequences of
meaningless tokens before the query prompt can consistently enhance LLM
reasoning performance, this work analyzes the underlying mechanism driving this
phenomenon and based on these insights proposes a more principled method that
allows for similar performance gains. First, we find that the improvements
arise from a redistribution of activations in the LLM's MLP layers, where near
zero activations become less frequent while large magnitude activations
increase. This redistribution enhances the model's representational capacity by
suppressing weak signals and promoting stronger, more informative ones.
Building on this insight, we propose the Activation Redistribution Module
(ARM), a lightweight inference-time technique that modifies activations
directly without altering the input sequence. ARM adaptively identifies
near-zero activations after the non-linear function and shifts them outward,
implicitly reproducing the beneficial effects of meaningless tokens in a
controlled manner. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and model
architectures clearly show that ARM consistently improves LLM performance on
reasoning tasks while requiring only a few lines of simple code to implement.
Our findings deliver both a clear mechanistic explanation for the unexpected
benefits of meaningless tokens and a simple yet effective technique that
harnesses activation redistribution to further improve LLM performance.

Result: 在1.5B和7B模型上分别比GRPO提升3.30和4.82分，且收敛速度更快

Conclusion: 从梯度优化角度提出的CurES方法能有效提升LLM推理任务的训练效率和收敛速度

Abstract: Curriculum learning plays a crucial role in enhancing the training efficiency
of large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks. However, existing methods
often fail to adequately account for variations in prompt difficulty or rely on
simplistic filtering mechanisms to select prompt datasets within a narrow
criterion range, resulting in significant computational waste. In this work, we
approach the problem from the perspective of reinforcement learning gradient
optimization, offering a systematic and theoretical investigation into how to
improve the training efficiency of LLMs. We identify two key factors
influencing training efficiency: the selection of training prompts and the
allocation of rollout quantities across different prompts. Our theoretical
analysis reveals that the sampling distribution of prompts dictates the
convergence rate of gradient descent, while the allocation of the rollout
quantity influences the consistency and stability of overall gradient updates.
Based on these insights, we propose CurES, an efficient training method that
accelerates convergence and employs Bayesian posterior estimation to minimize
computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that our CurES outperforms
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by \textbf{+3.30} points and
\textbf{+4.82} points with 1.5B and 7B models, respectively. Additionally,
CurES exhibits faster convergence compared to baselines, including GRPO.

Motivation: 传统PINNs和相关方法在处理奇异扰动边界值问题时难以解析尖锐梯度，而X-TFC虽然避免了多目标优化，但在边界层问题上计算效率低下且不兼容域分解。

Method: 使用可微分的逻辑门进行软域分解，动态调整径向基函数核宽度，无需界面惩罚项，并引入算子条件元学习层来学习从PDE参数到最优门配置的概率映射。

Result: 在1D对流-扩散基准测试中，Gated X-TFC比标准X-TFC误差降低一个数量级，使用80%更少的配点，训练时间减少66%。该方法可扩展到多子域和高维问题。

Conclusion: Gated X-TFC为PINNs提供了一个简单而准确的替代方案，在具有挑战性的边界层区域中具有计算效率优势。未来工作将关注非线性问题。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and related methods struggle to
resolve sharp gradients in singularly perturbed boundary value problems without
resorting to some form of domain decomposition, which often introduce complex
interface penalties. While the Extreme Theory of Functional Connections (X-TFC)
avoids multi-objective optimization by employing exact boundary condition
enforcement, it remains computationally inefficient for boundary layers and
incompatible with decomposition. We propose Gated X-TFC, a novel framework for
both forward and inverse problems, that overcomes these limitations through a
soft, learned domain decomposition. Our method replaces hard interfaces with a
differentiable logistic gate that dynamically adapts radial basis function
(RBF) kernel widths across the domain, eliminating the need for interface
penalties. This approach yields not only superior accuracy but also dramatic
improvements in computational efficiency: on a benchmark one dimensional (1D)
convection-diffusion, Gated X-TFC achieves an order-of-magnitude lower error
than standard X-TFC while using 80 percent fewer collocation points and
reducing training time by 66 percent. In addition, we introduce an
operator-conditioned meta-learning layer that learns a probabilistic mapping
from PDE parameters to optimal gate configurations, enabling fast,
uncertainty-aware warm-starting for new problem instances. We further
demonstrate scalability to multiple subdomains and higher dimensions by solving
a twin boundary-layer equation and a 2D Poisson problem with a sharp Gaussian
source. Overall, Gated X-TFC delivers a simple alternative alternative to PINNs
that is both accurate and computationally efficient for challenging
boundar-layer regimes. Future work will focus on nonlinear problems.

Conclusion: 建立了秘密诱导的公共基准，证明多种技术可以有效发现AI隐藏的知识，为模型审计提供了重要工具。

Abstract: We study secret elicitation: discovering knowledge that an AI possesses but
does not explicitly verbalize. As a testbed, we train three families of large
language models (LLMs) to possess specific knowledge that they apply downstream
but deny knowing when asked directly. For example, in one setting, we train an
LLM to generate replies that are consistent with knowing the user is female,
while denying this knowledge when asked directly. We then design various
black-box and white-box secret elicitation techniques and evaluate them based
on whether they can help an LLM auditor successfully guess the secret
knowledge. Many of our techniques improve on simple baselines. Our most
effective techniques (performing best in 2/3 settings) are based on prefill
attacks, a black-box technique where the LLM reveals secret knowledge when
generating a completion from a predefined prefix. In our remaining setting,
white-box techniques based on logit lens and sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are
most effective. We release our models and code, establishing a public benchmark
for evaluating secret elicitation methods.

propose a non-image-based, two-level ensemble model for DR prediction using
routine laboratory test results. In the first stage, base models (Linear SVC,
Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost) are hyperparameter tuned and
internally stacked across different configurations to optimize metrics such as
accuracy, recall, and precision. In the second stage, predictions are
aggregated using Random Forest as a meta-learner. This hierarchical stacking
strategy improves generalization, balances performance across multiple metrics,
and remains computationally efficient compared to deep learning approaches. The
model achieved Accuracy 0.9433, F1 Score 0.9425, Recall 0.9207, Precision
0.9653, ROC-AUC 0.9844, and AUPRC 0.9875, surpassing one-level stacking and FCN
baselines. These results highlight the model potential for accurate and
interpretable DR risk prediction in clinical settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的多演员多评论家深度确定性强化学习方法，通过非支配排序选择演员、基于分位数的集成策略评估演员和评论家，在MuJoCo基准测试中优于现有方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has gathered much attention in recent years due to its
rapid development and rich applications, especially on control systems and
robotics. When tackling real-world applications with reinforcement learning
method, the corresponded Markov decision process may have huge discrete or even
continuous state/action space. Deep reinforcement learning has been studied for
handling these issues through deep learning for years, and one promising branch
is the actor-critic architecture. Many past studies leveraged multiple critics
to enhance the accuracy of evaluation of a policy for addressing the
overestimation and underestimation issues. However, few studies have considered
the architecture with multiple actors together with multiple critics. This
study proposes a novel multi-actor multi-critic (MAMC) deep deterministic
reinforcement learning method. The proposed method has three main features,
including selection of actors based on non-dominated sorting for exploration
with respect to skill and creativity factors, evaluation for actors and critics
using a quantile-based ensemble strategy, and exploiting actors with best skill
factor. Theoretical analysis proves the learning stability and bounded
estimation bias for the MAMC. The present study examines the performance on a
well-known reinforcement learning benchmark MuJoCo. Experimental results show
that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art deep deterministic
based reinforcement learning methods. Experimental analysis also indicates the
proposed components are effective. Empirical analysis further investigates the
validity of the proposed method, and shows its benefit on complicated problems.

Motivation: 从观测数据中学习动力系统的随机模型在许多科学领域具有重要意义，但现有自编码器方法在随机系统建模方面存在局限性。

Method: 基于变分自编码器框架，同时估计系统状态轨迹和噪声时间序列，支持多步系统演化，并采用教师强制策略来缓解随机系统建模的限制。

Abstract: Learning stochastic models of dynamical systems underlying observed data is
of interest in many scientific fields. Here we propose a novel method for this
task, based on the framework of variational autoencoders for dynamical systems.
The method estimates from the data both the system state trajectories and noise
time series. This approach allows to perform multi-step system evolution and
supports a teacher forcing strategy, alleviating limitations of
autoencoder-based approaches for stochastic systems. We demonstrate the
performance of the proposed approach on six test problems, covering simulated
and experimental data. We further show the effects of the teacher forcing
interval on the nature of the internal dynamics, and compare it to the
deterministic models with equivalent architecture.

TL;DR: 本文分析了神经网络回归中的几何特性，发现与分类任务中的神经坍缩不同，回归任务中的坍缩会降低性能。通过内在维度分析，揭示了过压缩和欠压缩两种机制，并提出了改善泛化的实用策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然神经坍缩在分类任务中被证明有益于泛化，但回归任务中的类似坍缩现象却会损害性能。本文旨在解释这种差异，并探索神经网络回归中学习表示的几何特性。

Method: 通过内在维度分析，估计最后一层特征的内在维度(ID_H)并与回归目标的内在维度(ID_Y)进行比较。在控制任务和合成数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: 坍缩模型表现出ID_H < ID_Y，导致过压缩和泛化性能差；非坍缩模型通常保持ID_H > ID_Y。性能与ID_H的关系取决于数据量和噪声水平。识别了过压缩和欠压缩两种机制。

Conclusion: 研究为神经回归提供了新的几何洞察，并提出了通过调整特征维度来增强泛化的实用策略。

Abstract: Neural multivariate regression underpins a wide range of domains such as
control, robotics, and finance, yet the geometry of its learned representations
remains poorly characterized. While neural collapse has been shown to benefit
generalization in classification, we find that analogous collapse in regression
consistently degrades performance. To explain this contrast, we analyze models
through the lens of intrinsic dimension. Across control tasks and synthetic
datasets, we estimate the intrinsic dimension of last-layer features (ID_H) and
compare it with that of the regression targets (ID_Y). Collapsed models exhibit
ID_H < ID_Y, leading to over-compression and poor generalization, whereas
non-collapsed models typically maintain ID_H > ID_Y. For the non-collapsed
models, performance with respect to ID_H depends on the data quantity and noise
levels. From these observations, we identify two regimes (over-compressed and
under-compressed) that determine when expanding or reducing feature
dimensionality improves performance. Our results provide new geometric insights
into neural regression and suggest practical strategies for enhancing
generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列模型无法处理文本信息，而LLM在处理数值时间序列数据时效率低下且缺乏时间序列预训练，需要解决这一能力鸿沟。

Method: 使用补丁编码器-解码器架构增强LLM的时间序列感知能力，在200万时间序列-文本样本上进行多任务训练，包括预测、问答、模式解释、分类和报告生成。

Result: TsLLM在需要时间序列分析与自然语言整合的任务上表现优异，虽然不超越专业模型在传统基准上的表现，但提供了现有方法无法实现的能力。

Conclusion: 建立了时间序列分析的新范式，弥合数值计算与自然语言理解之间的差距，通过自然语言交互实现复杂时间推理的民主化访问。

Abstract: Time series data is fundamental to decision-making in many crucial domains
including healthcare, finance, and environmental science. However, analyzing
this data often requires incorporating unstructured contextual information,
answering domain-specific questions, and generating natural language
explanations -- capabilities that traditional time series models lack due to
their inability to process text. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at
contextual reasoning and knowledge integration, they struggle with numerical
time series due to inefficient text-based representations and limited exposure
to temporal data during pretraining. We address this gap by augmenting an LLM
with specialized time series perception through a patch-based encoder-decoder
architecture. We train this Time Series-augmented LLM (TsLLM) on a large corpus
of over 2 million interleaved time series and text examples spanning diverse
analysis tasks: forecasting with contextual information, time series
question-answering, pattern explanation, classification with natural language
outputs, and report generation. This training enables TsLLM to leverage both
its language understanding and newly acquired temporal reasoning capabilities.
While not designed to surpass specialized models on traditional benchmarks,
TsLLM demonstrates strong performance on tasks requiring the integration of
time series analysis with natural language -- capabilities that existing
approaches cannot provide. Our work establishes a new paradigm for time series
analysis that bridges numerical computation and natural language understanding,
democratizing access to sophisticated temporal reasoning through natural
language interaction.

TL;DR: 提出A3-FL框架，通过注意力机制处理非独立同分布生物特征数据，结合差分隐私和安全更新协议，在保护隐私的同时提高指纹识别的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物特征数据敏感，集中式训练存在隐私风险。联邦学习虽然提供隐私保护替代方案，但传统FL在处理非独立同分布数据和可解释性方面存在困难。

Method: 在中央服务器添加注意力机制，根据重要性加权本地模型更新；使用差分隐私和安全更新协议保护数据；采用Siamese-CNN提取指纹特征；在FVC2004指纹数据集上评估。

Result: A3-FL框架在准确率(0.8413)、收敛速度和鲁棒性方面优于标准FL(FedAvg)和静态基线；即使使用差分隐私，准确率仍保持在0.8330。

Conclusion: 该工作提出了一个可扩展且隐私敏感的生物特征系统，用于分布式环境中的安全有效识别。

Abstract: Because biometric data is sensitive, centralized training poses a privacy
risk, even though biometric recognition is essential for contemporary
applications. Federated learning (FL), which permits decentralized training,
provides a privacy-preserving substitute. Conventional FL, however, has trouble
with interpretability and heterogeneous data (non-IID). In order to handle
non-IID biometric data, this framework adds an attention mechanism at the
central server that weights local model updates according to their
significance. Differential privacy and secure update protocols safeguard data
while preserving accuracy. The A3-FL framework is evaluated in this study using
FVC2004 fingerprint data, with each client's features extracted using a Siamese
Convolutional Neural Network (Siamese-CNN). By dynamically modifying client
contributions, the attention mechanism increases the accuracy of the global
model.The accuracy, convergence speed, and robustness of the A3-FL framework
are superior to those of standard FL (FedAvg) and static baselines, according
to experimental evaluations using fingerprint data (FVC2004). The accuracy of
the attention-based approach was 0.8413, while FedAvg, Local-only, and
Centralized approaches were 0.8164, 0.7664, and 0.7997, respectively. Accuracy
stayed high at 0.8330 even with differential privacy. A scalable and
privacy-sensitive biometric system for secure and effective recognition in
dispersed environments is presented in this work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列模型缺乏执行复杂推理过程的能力，如反事实分析、逻辑推理等，而LLMs在时间序列任务上表现不佳，需要专门训练来支持多步推理。

Method: 使用残差向量量化VAE创建高保真离散token，集成到预训练LLM词汇表中；采用两阶段训练：监督微调掌握新表示，然后使用GRPO在可验证问题上训练，鼓励显式推理步骤。

Result: 实验表明，这种带有中间思维链推理的强化学习方法显著提升了LLM在各种时间序列分析任务中的性能。

Conclusion: COUNTS为复杂时间序列数据推理开辟了新可能性，证明了RL驱动的思维链推理在时间序列分析中的有效性。

Abstract: Complex numerical time series analysis often demands multi-step reasoning
capabilities beyond current models' reach. Tasks like medical diagnosis and
weather forecasting require sequential reasoning processes -- including
counterfactual analysis, logical deduction, knowledge application, and
multi-modal contextual integration -- that existing time series models cannot
explicitly perform. While recent research has shown large language models
(LLMs) can achieve sophisticated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning through
reinforcement learning (RL), these advances have primarily focused on
mathematical and coding domains, with LLMs still demonstrating poor performance
on time series tasks. We introduce Chain Of thought for Understanding Numerical
Time Series (COUNTS), the first framework that trains LLMs to perform CoT
reasoning across diverse time series tasks using RL with verifiable rewards.
Our approach employs a Residual Vector-Quantized VAE to create high-fidelity
discrete tokens that seamlessly integrate into a pre-trained LLM's vocabulary.
COUNTS undergoes a two-stage training process: first, supervised fine-tuning on
time series analysis tasks to master our novel representations, followed by
Group Relative Policy Optimization training on verifiable problems using
prompting strategies that encourage explicit reasoning steps before producing
final answers. Our experiments demonstrate that this RL-driven approach with
intermediate CoT reasoning significantly enhances LLM performance across
various time series analysis tasks, opening new possibilities for complex
temporal data reasoning.

Motivation: 传统机器学习方法在高维欧几里得空间中难以捕捉序列数据的复杂关系和层次结构，限制了序列分类和相似性测量的准确性。

Method: 将生物序列特征表示转换到双曲面空间，计算基于双曲面特征的核矩阵，利用双曲面特征向量的内积来测量序列对之间的相似性。

Result: 实验评估表明该方法能有效捕捉重要序列相关性并提高分类准确率。

Conclusion: 双曲面空间表示能更好地保留生物序列的固有结构信息，为序列分析提供更有效的相似性测量方法。

Abstract: Genomic sequence analysis plays a crucial role in various scientific and
medical domains. Traditional machine-learning approaches often struggle to
capture the complex relationships and hierarchical structures of sequence data
when working in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces. This limitation hinders
accurate sequence classification and similarity measurement. To address these
challenges, this research proposes a method to transform the feature
representation of biological sequences into the hyperboloid space. By applying
a transformation, the sequences are mapped onto the hyperboloid, preserving
their inherent structural information. Once the sequences are represented in
the hyperboloid space, a kernel matrix is computed based on the hyperboloid
features. The kernel matrix captures the pairwise similarities between
sequences, enabling more effective analysis of biological sequence
relationships. This approach leverages the inner product of the hyperboloid
feature vectors to measure the similarity between pairs of sequences. The
experimental evaluation of the proposed approach demonstrates its efficacy in
capturing important sequence correlations and improving classification
accuracy.

Motivation: 现有推理训练促使LLMs生成长链思维，虽然提高了准确性但增加了上下文长度、计算成本和延迟。研究能否利用元认知找到更好的权衡方案。

Method: 提出PDR方法：1) 并行生成多样化草稿；2) 蒸馏到有限文本工作空间；3) 基于工作空间进行精炼。还研究了并行度为1的特殊情况Sequential Refinement (SR)。

Result: PDR实例在数学任务上表现优于长链思维，延迟更低。在AIME 2024上提升11%，AIME 2025上提升9%。

Conclusion: 迭代推理管道在匹配的序列预算下超越单次推理基线，PDR带来最大收益。成功表明进一步训练可能改变帕累托前沿。

Abstract: Reasoning training incentivizes LLMs to produce long chains of thought (long
CoT), which among other things, allows them to explore solution strategies with
self-checking. This results in higher accuracy, but inflates context length,
token/compute cost, and answer latency. We ask: Can current models leverage
their metacognition to provide other combinations on this Pareto frontier,
e.g., better accuracy with lower context length and/or latency? Abstractly, we
view the model as an improvement operator on its own "thoughts" with a
continuum of possible strategies. We identify an interesting inference family
Parallel-Distill-Refine (PDR), which performs the following: (i) generate
diverse drafts in parallel; (ii) distill them into a bounded, textual
workspace; and (iii) refine conditioned on this workspace, producing an output
that seeds the next round. Importantly, context length (hence compute cost) is
controllable via degree of parallelism, and is no longer conflated with the
total number of generated tokens. We report PDR instantiations of current
models that give better accuracy than long CoT while incurring lower latency.
Setting degree of parallelism to 1 yields an interesting subcase, Sequential
Refinement (SR) (iteratively improve a single candidate answer) which provides
performance superior to long CoT. Success of such model orchestrations raises
the question whether further training could shift the Pareto frontier. To this
end, we train an 8B thinking model with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to make it
consistent with PDR as the inference method. On math tasks with verifiable
answers, iterative pipelines surpass single-pass baselines at matched
sequential budgets, with PDR delivering the largest gains (e.g., +11% on AIME
2024 and +9% on AIME 2025).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界表格数据经常存在缺失值，传统简单插补策略会引入偏差或扭曲数据分布，需要能够提供高质量插补、适应不同数据集大小且推理快速的插补方法。

Method: 使用自解码器架构的隐式神经表示框架，将表格建模为神经函数，引入可学习的行和特征嵌入来处理表格数据的离散结构，支持从部分观测中推断嵌入，实现无需修改训练模型的实例自适应插补。

Result: 在12个真实世界数据集和多种缺失机制下评估，显示出持续强大的插补准确性，在大多数情况下匹配或优于传统方法（KNN、MICE、MissForest）和深度学习模型（GAIN、ReMasker），在高维数据集上优势最明显。

Conclusion: TabINR框架在表格数据插补任务中表现出色，特别是在处理高维数据时具有明显优势，为表格数据缺失值处理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Tabular data builds the basis for a wide range of applications, yet
real-world datasets are frequently incomplete due to collection errors, privacy
restrictions, or sensor failures. As missing values degrade the performance or
hinder the applicability of downstream models, and while simple imputing
strategies tend to introduce bias or distort the underlying data distribution,
we require imputers that provide high-quality imputations, are robust across
dataset sizes and yield fast inference. We therefore introduce TabINR, an
auto-decoder based Implicit Neural Representation (INR) framework that models
tables as neural functions. Building on recent advances in generalizable INRs,
we introduce learnable row and feature embeddings that effectively deal with
the discrete structure of tabular data and can be inferred from partial
observations, enabling instance adaptive imputations without modifying the
trained model. We evaluate our framework across a diverse range of twelve
real-world datasets and multiple missingness mechanisms, demonstrating
consistently strong imputation accuracy, mostly matching or outperforming
classical (KNN, MICE, MissForest) and deep learning based models (GAIN,
ReMasker), with the clearest gains on high-dimensional datasets.

Motivation: DP-SGD在提供强隐私保证的同时，增加的噪声会破坏梯度矩阵的低秩结构，导致优化过程变慢，样本效率低下。

Method: 利用随机矩阵理论对梯度进行去噪后处理，恢复梯度矩阵的低秩结构，提高与原始信号的匹配度。

Result: 在RoBERTa模型GLUE任务上的DP-SGD微调中，相比现有方法提高了样本效率，在不需要最优性能时显著减少训练时间。

Conclusion: 矩阵恢复技术可以在不损害隐私保证的情况下提升私有语言模型训练的实用性。

Abstract: We address the challenge of sample efficiency in differentially private
fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) using DP-SGD. While DP-SGD provides
strong privacy guarantees, the added noise significantly increases the entropy
of gradient matrices, disrupting their low-rank structure and slowing
optimization. We propose a post-processing algorithm that leverages random
matrix theory to denoise gradients, restore low-rank structure, and improve
alignment with the original signal. Applied to DP-SGD fine-tuning of RoBERTa on
GLUE tasks, our method improves sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, substantially reducing training time when optimal performance is
not required. This work demonstrates that matrix recovery techniques can
enhance the utility of private language model training without compromising
privacy guarantees.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for solving optimal transport (OT) problems
based on the Hamilton--Jacobi (HJ) equation, whose viscosity solution uniquely
characterizes the OT map. By leveraging the method of characteristics, we
derive closed-form, bidirectional transport maps, thereby eliminating the need
for numerical integration. The proposed method adopts a pure minimization
framework: a single neural network is trained with a loss function derived from
the method of characteristics of the HJ equation. This design guarantees
convergence to the optimal map while eliminating adversarial training stages,
thereby substantially reducing computational complexity. Furthermore, the
framework naturally extends to a wide class of cost functions and supports
class-conditional transport. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets
demonstrate the accuracy, scalability, and efficiency of the proposed method,
establishing it as a principled and versatile tool for OT applications with
provable optimality.

Conclusion: ALI-CFM方法具有多功能性和可扩展性，能够有效解决仅有离散观测数据时的动态系统建模问题。

Abstract: Learning the dynamics of a process given sampled observations at several time
points is an important but difficult task in many scientific applications. When
no ground-truth trajectories are available, but one has only snapshots of data
taken at discrete time steps, the problem of modelling the dynamics, and thus
inferring the underlying trajectories, can be solved by multi-marginal
generalisations of flow matching algorithms. This paper proposes a novel flow
matching method that overcomes the limitations of existing multi-marginal
trajectory inference algorithms. Our proposed method, ALI-CFM, uses a
GAN-inspired adversarial loss to fit neurally parametrised interpolant curves
between source and target points such that the marginal distributions at
intermediate time points are close to the observed distributions. The resulting
interpolants are smooth trajectories that, as we show, are unique under mild
assumptions. These interpolants are subsequently marginalised by a flow
matching algorithm, yielding a trained vector field for the underlying
dynamics. We showcase the versatility and scalability of our method by
outperforming the existing baselines on spatial transcriptomics and cell
tracking datasets, while performing on par with them on single-cell trajectory
prediction.

TL;DR: M2PO是一种异步强化学习方法，通过约束重要性权重的二阶矩来抑制极端异常值，在高度陈旧的数据下实现稳定的离策略训练，性能可媲美同策略方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法依赖同策略训练，需要每次更新时生成新的轨迹数据，效率低下。异步RL系统虽然解耦了轨迹生成和训练，但现有方法在处理高度陈旧数据时性能会下降或崩溃。

Method: 提出M2PO（二阶矩信任策略优化），通过约束重要性权重的二阶矩来抑制极端异常值，同时保留信息性更新，精确屏蔽高方差标记并保持优化稳定性。

Result: M2PO在高度陈旧情况下显著减少被裁剪标记的比例（从1.22%降至0.06%），在6个模型（1.7B到32B）和8个基准测试中，即使数据陈旧达256次模型更新，仍能实现稳定的离策略训练，性能匹配同策略方法。

Conclusion: M2PO证明了陈旧数据如果被适当利用，可以像同策略数据一样具有信息性，为高效可扩展的强化学习训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been central to recent advances in large language
model reasoning, but most algorithms rely on on-policy training that demands
fresh rollouts at every update, limiting efficiency and scalability.
Asynchronous RL systems alleviate this by decoupling rollout generation from
training, yet their effectiveness hinges on tolerating large staleness in
rollout data, a setting where existing methods either degrade in performance or
collapse. We revisit this challenge and uncover a prosperity-before-collapse
phenomenon: stale data can be as informative as on-policy data if exploited
properly. Building on this insight, we introduce M2PO (Second-Moment Trust
Policy Optimization), which constrains the second moment of importance weights
to suppress only extreme outliers while preserving informative updates.
Notably, M2PO sharply reduces the fraction of clipped tokens under high
staleness (from 1.22% to 0.06% over training), precisely masking high-variance
tokens while maintaining stable optimization. Extensive evaluation across six
models (from 1.7B to 32B) and eight benchmarks shows that M2PO delivers stable
off-policy training even with data stale by at least 256 model updates and
matches on-policy performance.

Abstract: The emergence of in-context learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs)
remains poorly understood despite its consistent effectiveness, enabling models
to adapt to new tasks from only a handful of examples. To clarify and improve
these capabilities, we characterize how the statistical properties of the
pretraining distribution (e.g., tail behavior, coverage) shape ICL on numerical
tasks. We develop a theoretical framework that unifies task selection and
generalization, extending and sharpening earlier results, and show how
distributional properties govern sample efficiency, task retrieval, and
robustness. To this end, we generalize Bayesian posterior consistency and
concentration results to heavy-tailed priors and dependent sequences, better
reflecting the structure of LLM pretraining data. We then empirically study how
ICL performance varies with the pretraining distribution on challenging tasks
such as stochastic differential equations and stochastic processes with memory.
Together, these findings suggest that controlling key statistical properties of
the pretraining distribution is essential for building ICL-capable and reliable
LLMs.

Abstract: Data is vital in enabling machine learning models to advance research and
practical applications in finance, where accurate and robust models are
essential for investment and trading decision-making. However, real-world data
is limited despite its quantity, quality, and variety. The data shortage of
various financial assets directly hinders the performance of machine learning
models designed to trade and invest in these assets. Generative methods can
mitigate this shortage. In this paper, we introduce a set of novel techniques
for time series data generation (we name them Fiaingen) and assess their
performance across three criteria: (a) overlap of real-world and synthetic data
on a reduced dimensionality space, (b) performance on downstream machine
learning tasks, and (c) runtime performance. Our experiments demonstrate that
the methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across the three criteria
listed above. Synthetic data generated with Fiaingen methods more closely
mirrors the original time series data while keeping data generation time close
to seconds - ensuring the scalability of the proposed approach. Furthermore,
models trained on it achieve performance close to those trained with real-world
data.

Motivation: 虽然归一化技术在深度学习中广泛应用，但其理论理解仍然相对有限。本文旨在建立权重归一化在过参数化矩阵感知问题中的优势。

Method: 使用广义权重归一化结合黎曼优化方法来解决过参数化矩阵感知问题。

Result: 证明权重归一化能够实现线性收敛，迭代复杂度和样本复杂度随着过参数化程度的增加而多项式地改善。

Conclusion: 这是首个描述权重归一化如何利用过参数化实现矩阵感知问题更快收敛的工作，为归一化技术的理论理解提供了重要见解。

Abstract: While normalization techniques are widely used in deep learning, their
theoretical understanding remains relatively limited. In this work, we
establish the benefits of (generalized) weight normalization (WN) applied to
the overparameterized matrix sensing problem. We prove that WN with Riemannian
optimization achieves linear convergence, yielding an exponential speedup over
standard methods that do not use WN. Our analysis further demonstrates that
both iteration and sample complexity improve polynomially as the level of
overparameterization increases. To the best of our knowledge, this work
provides the first characterization of how WN leverages overparameterization
for faster convergence in matrix sensing.

*Gaoxiang Luo,Aryan Deshwal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出COM-BOM算法，通过组合贝叶斯优化解决示例选择的多目标优化问题，同时优化预测准确性和模型校准度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有示例搜索方法仅优化预测准确性，忽视了模型校准这一影响可信度和安全部署的关键因素

Method: 将示例选择建模为多目标优化问题，使用样本高效的组合贝叶斯优化算法(COM-BOM)寻找准确性和校准误差之间的帕累托前沿

Result: 在MMLU-Pro基准测试中，COM-BOM在联合优化两个目标方面优于或匹配基线方法，且仅需最少的LLM API调用

Conclusion: COM-BOM能够有效平衡预测准确性和模型校准，为可信的上下文学习提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Selecting an optimal set of exemplars is critical for good performance of
in-context learning. However, prior exemplar search methods narrowly optimize
for predictive accuracy, critically neglecting model calibration--a key
determinant of trustworthiness and safe deployment. In this paper, we formulate
exemplar selection as a multi-objective optimization problem, explicitly
targeting both the maximization of predictive accuracy and the minimization of
expected calibration error. We solve this problem with a sample-efficient
Combinatorial Bayesian Optimization algorithm (COM-BOM) to find the Pareto
front that optimally trades off the two objectives of accuracy and calibration.
We evaluate COM-BOM on multiple tasks from unsaturated MMLU-Pro benchmark and
find that COM-BOM beats or matches the baselines at jointly optimizing the two
objectives, while requiring a minimal number of LLM API calls.

*Yanbo Xu,Yu Wu,Sungjae Park,Zhizhuo Zhou,Shubham Tulsiani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种机制来控制去噪扩散和流匹配模型的采样多样性，允许用户从比训练分布更尖锐或更宽泛的分布中采样，无需微调即可应用于现成模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型缺乏对采样多样性的灵活控制，用户无法根据需要调整采样分布的尖锐程度，限制了模型在不同任务中的适应性。

Method: 基于对噪声数据分布得分函数的观察，通过重新缩放这些得分函数来控制'局部'采样温度，兼容确定性和随机性采样器。

Result: 在5个不同任务上验证：图像生成、姿态估计、深度预测、机器人操作和蛋白质设计。深度预测模型从更可能的深度估计中采样表现更好，而图像生成模型在采样稍平坦分布时表现更佳。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种简单有效的机制来控制扩散模型的采样多样性，无需额外训练即可提升多种任务的性能。

Abstract: We present a mechanism to steer the sampling diversity of denoising diffusion
and flow matching models, allowing users to sample from a sharper or broader
distribution than the training distribution. We build on the observation that
these models leverage (learned) score functions of noisy data distributions for
sampling and show that rescaling these allows one to effectively control a
`local' sampling temperature. Notably, this approach does not require any
finetuning or alterations to training strategy, and can be applied to any
off-the-shelf model and is compatible with both deterministic and stochastic
samplers. We first validate our framework on toy 2D data, and then demonstrate
its application for diffusion models trained across five disparate tasks --
image generation, pose estimation, depth prediction, robot manipulation, and
protein design. We find that across these tasks, our approach allows sampling
from sharper (or flatter) distributions, yielding performance gains e.g., depth
prediction models benefit from sampling more likely depth estimates, whereas
image generation models perform better when sampling a slightly flatter
distribution. Project page: https://temporalscorerescaling.github.io

*Leyla Mirvakhabova,Babak Ehteshami Bejnordi,Gaurav Kumar,Hanxue Liang,Wanru Zhao,Paul Whatmough*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Dirichlet-Prior Shaping Loss (DPSL)，一种新的路由器正则化技术，通过将专家分配匹配到目标Dirichlet先验来直接塑造路由概率分布，解决了预训练密集模型升级为稀疏混合专家模型时的专家专业化不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将预训练密集模型升级为稀疏混合专家模型能有效增加模型容量，但由于简单的权重复制，常常遭受专家专业化不足的问题。分析发现，即使使用传统正则化，升级后的混合专家模型仍表现出低置信度、弱差异化的路由，阻碍性能提升。

Method: 引入Dirichlet-Prior Shaping Loss (DPSL)，直接通过匹配专家分配到目标Dirichlet先验来塑造路由概率分布。该方法提供对专家平衡和专业化的细粒度控制，并能编码归纳偏置，如鼓励专家专注于特定模态或任务，无需手动干预。

Result: 在升级的混合专家视觉语言模型（使用Qwen2、Phi3、Llama3.2 LLM骨干）上的实验显示，DPSL在标准视觉语言基准测试中持续优于升级策略和正则化技术。

Conclusion: DPSL解决了专家专业化不足的关键问题，促进了更具适应性、更高性能的模型，并且是一个通用工具，适用于任何输出分类概率分布的模块，超越了混合专家训练的范围。

Abstract: Upcycling pre-trained dense models into sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs)
efficiently increases model capacity but often suffers from poor expert
specialization due to naive weight replication. Our analysis reveals that
upcycled MoEs, even with conventional regularization, exhibit low-confidence,
weakly differentiated routing, hindering performance. We introduce
Dirichlet-Prior Shaping Loss (DPSL), a novel router regularization technique
that directly shapes routing probability distributions by matching expert
assignments to a target Dirichlet prior. DPSL offers fine-grained control over
expert balance and specialization, and enables encoding of inductive biases
such as encouraging experts to focus on specific modalities or tasks, without
requiring manual intervention; notably, DPSL is a general tool applicable to
any module that outputs categorical probability distributions, extending its
utility beyond MoE training. Experiments on upcycled MoE vision-language models
(with Qwen2, Phi3, Llama3.2 LLM backbones) show DPSL consistently outperforms
upcycling strategies and regularization techniques across standard
vision-language benchmarks, addressing the critical issue of poor
specialization and fostering more adaptive, higher-performing models.
