### [1] [Mitigating Easy Option Bias in Multiple-Choice Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13428)
*Hao Zhang,Chen Li,Basura Fernando*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现多选VQA基准中存在Easy-Options Bias问题，模型仅凭视觉和选项就能猜对答案，无需问题。提出了GroundAttack工具生成困难负选项，创建无偏数据集来更真实评估VLM能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现现有VQA基准存在严重偏差，模型可以通过视觉-选项相似性匹配轻松猜对答案，导致对视觉语言模型真实问答能力的高估。

Method: 通过接地实验分析偏差来源，开发GroundAttack工具自动生成视觉上合理的困难负选项，创建EOB-free标注数据集。

Result: 在无偏数据集上，当前VLM在仅视觉+选项设置下准确率接近随机，在完整设置下准确率也大幅下降，证明原基准存在严重评估偏差。

Conclusion: 揭示了VQA基准中的系统性偏差问题，提出的解决方案能更真实地评估模型能力，为未来基准设计提供了重要参考。

Abstract: In this early study, we observe an Easy-Options Bias (EOB) issue in some
multiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks such as MMStar,
RealWorldQA, SEED-Bench, Next-QA, STAR benchmark and Video-MME. This bias
allows vision-language models (VLMs) to select the correct answer using only
the vision (V) and options (O) as inputs, without the need for the question
(Q). Through grounding experiments, we attribute the bias to an imbalance in
visual relevance: the correct answer typically aligns more closely with the
visual contents than the negative options in feature space, creating a shortcut
for VLMs to infer the answer via simply vision-option similarity matching. To
fix this, we introduce GroundAttack, a toolkit that automatically generates
hard negative options as visually plausible as the correct answer. We apply it
to the NExT-QA and MMStar datasets, creating new EOB-free annotations. On these
EOB-free annotations, current VLMs approach to random accuracies under (V+O)
settings, and drop to non-saturated accuracies under (V+Q+O) settings,
providing a more realistic evaluation of VLMs' QA ability. Codes and new
annotations will be released soon.

### [2] [YOLO11-CR: a Lightweight Convolution-and-Attention Framework for Accurate Fatigue Driving Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13205)
*Zhebin Jin,Ligang Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出YOLO11-CR轻量级目标检测模型，用于实时疲劳检测，通过CAFM和RCM模块提升特征表达和空间定位能力，在DSM数据集上表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生理和车辆动力学方法具有侵入性且硬件依赖，视觉方法存在小目标检测差和多尺度特征建模有限的问题，需要非侵入式、实时准确的疲劳检测方案

Method: YOLO11-CR模型包含两个关键模块：CAFM（卷积与注意力融合模块）整合CNN局部特征和Transformer全局上下文；RCM（矩形校准模块）捕获水平和垂直上下文信息改善空间定位

Result: 在DSM数据集上达到87.17%精确率、83.86%召回率、88.09% mAP@50和55.93% mAP@50-95，显著优于基线模型，消融实验验证模块有效性

Conclusion: YOLO11-CR为车载疲劳监测提供了实用高效解决方案，具有实际部署潜力，未来可扩展时间建模、多模态数据集成和嵌入式优化

Abstract: Driver fatigue detection is of paramount importance for intelligent
transportation systems due to its critical role in mitigating road traffic
accidents. While physiological and vehicle dynamics-based methods offer
accuracy, they are often intrusive, hardware-dependent, and lack robustness in
real-world environments. Vision-based techniques provide a non-intrusive and
scalable alternative, but still face challenges such as poor detection of small
or occluded objects and limited multi-scale feature modeling. To address these
issues, this paper proposes YOLO11-CR, a lightweight and efficient object
detection model tailored for real-time fatigue detection. YOLO11-CR introduces
two key modules: the Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM), which
integrates local CNN features with global Transformer-based context to enhance
feature expressiveness; and the Rectangular Calibration Module (RCM), which
captures horizontal and vertical contextual information to improve spatial
localization, particularly for profile faces and small objects like mobile
phones. Experiments on the DSM dataset demonstrated that YOLO11-CR achieves a
precision of 87.17%, recall of 83.86%, mAP@50 of 88.09%, and mAP@50-95 of
55.93%, outperforming baseline models significantly. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of the CAFM and RCM modules in improving both
sensitivity and localization accuracy. These results demonstrate that YOLO11-CR
offers a practical and high-performing solution for in-vehicle fatigue
monitoring, with strong potential for real-world deployment and future
enhancements involving temporal modeling, multi-modal data integration, and
embedded optimization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Mirage基准和Mirage-R1模型，用于解决真实世界中AI生成图像检测的挑战，在基准测试中比现有方法提升5-10%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI生成图像检测器在实验室环境下有效，但无法泛化到真实世界的嘈杂场景，需要应对从明显伪造到高度逼真的各种图像

Method: 构建Mirage基准数据集（包含互联网收集和专家合成图像），开发Mirage-R1视觉语言模型，采用启发式到分析式推理机制，两阶段训练（监督微调+强化学习），推理时自适应思考策略

Result: 在Mirage基准和公共基准上分别比最先进检测器领先5%和10%

Conclusion: Mirage基准和Mirage-R1模型有效解决了真实世界AI生成图像检测问题，在性能和推理速度之间取得了良好平衡

Abstract: The spreading of AI-generated images (AIGI), driven by advances in generative
AI, poses a significant threat to information security and public trust.
Existing AIGI detectors, while effective against images in clean laboratory
settings, fail to generalize to in-the-wild scenarios. These real-world images
are noisy, varying from ``obviously fake" images to realistic ones derived from
multiple generative models and further edited for quality control. We address
in-the-wild AIGI detection in this paper. We introduce Mirage, a challenging
benchmark designed to emulate the complexity of in-the-wild AIGI. Mirage is
constructed from two sources: (1) a large corpus of Internet-sourced AIGI
verified by human experts, and (2) a synthesized dataset created through the
collaboration between multiple expert generators, closely simulating the
realistic AIGI in the wild. Building on this benchmark, we propose Mirage-R1, a
vision-language model with heuristic-to-analytic reasoning, a reflective
reasoning mechanism for AIGI detection. Mirage-R1 is trained in two stages: a
supervised-fine-tuning cold start, followed by a reinforcement learning stage.
By further adopting an inference-time adaptive thinking strategy, Mirage-R1 is
able to provide either a quick judgment or a more robust and accurate
conclusion, effectively balancing inference speed and performance. Extensive
experiments show that our model leads state-of-the-art detectors by 5% and 10%
on Mirage and the public benchmark, respectively. The benchmark and code will
be made publicly available.

### [4] [DianJin-OCR-R1: Enhancing OCR Capabilities via a Reasoning-and-Tool Interleaved Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13238)
*Qian Chen,Xianyin Zhang,Lifan Guo,Feng Chen,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DianJin-OCR-R1是一个推理增强的视觉语言模型框架，通过结合自身OCR能力和调用专家模型工具来解决LVLMs在OCR任务中的幻觉问题，显著提升了识别性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在端到端文档解析方面表现出色，但存在幻觉问题（生成输入图像中不存在的文本），且在OCR任务上不如专门训练的专家模型有效

Method: 提出推理增强框架：1）模型先用自身OCR能力识别内容；2）调用其他专家模型工具获取参考结果；3）重新审视图像并反思推理过程，提供最终识别结果

Result: 在ReST和OmniDocBench数据集上评估，DianJin-OCR-R1模型持续优于非推理版本和专家OCR模型，证明了方法的有效性

Conclusion: 通过推理和工具交织的方法，既能利用专家模型减少幻觉，又能以较低成本提升VLM性能，为OCR任务提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have enabled a new
paradigm of end-to-end document image parsing, excelling in Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) tasks such as text, table, and formula recognition. However,
generative LVLMs, similarly to large language models (LLMs), are prone to
hallucinations--generating words that do not exist in input images.
Furthermore, LVLMs are designed for general purposes and tend to be less
effective on OCR tasks compared to expert models that are trained on
domain-specific datasets. In this paper, we propose DianJin-OCR-R1, a
reasoning-enhanced framework designed to address these limitations through
training reasoning-and-tool interleaved VLMs. Given a recognition instruction,
our DianJin-OCR-R1 model first recognizes the content in the input image by its
own OCR capabilities, and then calls other tools (i.e., other expert models) to
obtain their results as references, finally looks again the image and rethinks
about the reasoning process to provide the final recognized content. Since
architectures of expert models are tailored for specific OCR tasks, which makes
them less prone to hallucinations, their results can help VLMs mitigate
hallucinations. Additionally, expert models are typically smaller in scale and
easy to iterate, enabling performance improvements for VLMs at a lower cost. We
evaluate our model on ReST and OmniDocBench, and experimental results show that
our DianJin-OCR-R1 models consistently outperform their non-reasoning
counterparts and expert OCR models, which proves the effectiveness of our
method.

*Sumaiya Fazal,Sheeraz Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于卷积神经网络的乌尔都语光学字符识别系统，通过组件分类和自动特征学习实现了高精度识别


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乌尔都语作为一种草书体语言，具有复杂的几何和形态结构，传统的分割基于识别方法错误率较高

Method: 使用卷积神经网络进行自动特征学习，通过排列组合生成训练数据集，并采用连通组件技术获取细体，构建了两层层次神经网络来处理不同程度的字符排列组合

Result: 组件分类的识别精度达到0.99%，表现出艰

Conclusion: 组件基于的CNN方法能够有效处理乌尔都语的复杂字符识别问题，避免了传统分割方法的高错误率

Abstract: Urdu is a cursive script language and has similarities with Arabic and many
other South Asian languages. Urdu is difficult to classify due to its complex
geometrical and morphological structure. Character classification can be
processed further if segmentation technique is efficient, but due to context
sensitivity in Urdu, segmentation-based recognition often results with high
error rate. Our proposed approach for Urdu optical character recognition system
is a component-based classification relying on automatic feature learning
technique called convolutional neural network. CNN is trained and tested on
Urdu text dataset, which is generated through permutation process of three
characters and further proceeds to discarding unnecessary images by applying
connected component technique in order to obtain ligature only. Hierarchical
neural network is implemented with two levels to deal with three degrees of
character permutations and component classification Our model successfully
achieved 0.99% for component classification.

### [6] [Timestep-Compressed Attack on Spiking Neural Networks through Timestep-Level Backpropagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13812)
*Donghwa Kang,Doohyun Kim,Sang-Ki Ko,Jinkyu Lee,Hyeongboo Baek,Brent ByungHoon Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对脉冲神经网络的新型高效对抗攻击框架TCA，通过时间步压缩技术显著降低攻击延迟，相比现有方法减少56%以上的攻击时间，同时保持相近的攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于梯度的SNN对抗攻击方法存在严重的攻击延迟问题，这些方法直接扩展ANN范式，未能充分利用SNN的关键特性，导致多时间步处理产生大量延迟，不适用于实时应用。

Method: TCA框架包含两个核心组件：1) 时间步级反向传播(TLBP)，基于发现全局时间信息对攻击成功不关键，实现逐时间步评估和早期停止；2) 对抗性膜电位重用(A-MPR)，通过预计算和重用初始时间步的膜电位累积过程来避免低效的预热阶段。

Result: 在VGG-11和ResNet-17模型上的实验表明，TCA在白盒和黑盒设置下分别减少56.6%和57.1%的攻击延迟，同时保持可比的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: TCA通过充分利用SNN的时序特性，成功解决了现有对抗攻击方法的高延迟问题，为SNN在实时安全关键应用中的部署提供了可行的对抗攻击解决方案。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based adversarial attacks on spiking neural
networks (SNNs), which largely rely on extending FGSM and PGD frameworks, face
a critical limitation: substantial attack latency from multi-timestep
processing, rendering them infeasible for practical real-time applications.
This inefficiency stems from their design as direct extensions of ANN
paradigms, which fail to exploit key SNN properties. In this paper, we propose
the timestep-compressed attack (TCA), a novel framework that significantly
reduces attack latency. TCA introduces two components founded on key insights
into SNN behavior. First, timestep-level backpropagation (TLBP) is based on our
finding that global temporal information in backpropagation to generate
perturbations is not critical for an attack's success, enabling per-timestep
evaluation for early stopping. Second, adversarial membrane potential reuse
(A-MPR) is motivated by the observation that initial timesteps are
inefficiently spent accumulating membrane potential, a warm-up phase that can
be pre-calculated and reused. Our experiments on VGG-11 and ResNet-17 with the
CIFAR-10/100 and CIFAR10-DVS datasets show that TCA significantly reduces the
required attack latency by up to 56.6% and 57.1% compared to SOTA methods in
white-box and black-box settings, respectively, while maintaining a comparable
attack success rate.

*Zeynep Ozdemir,Hacer Yalim Keles,Omer Ozgur Tanriover*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLoE是一个课程学习框架，通过图像质量评估标签可靠性并考虑有序结构，显著提高了溃疡性结肠炎内镜图像MES分类的准确性和鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MES分类面临观察者间变异导致的标签噪声问题，且标准模型忽略评分的有序性，需要开发能够同时处理标签可靠性和有序结构的分类方法

Method: 使用轻量级模型估计图像质量作为标注置信度代理，构建从易到难的课程学习顺序，结合ResizeMix增强提高鲁棒性，支持CNN和Transformer架构

Result: 在LIMUC和HyperKvasir数据集上，ConvNeXt-Tiny达到82.5%准确率和0.894 QWK，性能优于强监督和自监督基线方法

Conclusion: 难度感知的训练策略在标签不确定性下能有效改善有序分类，CLoE框架具有实际应用潜力

Abstract: Estimating disease severity from endoscopic images is essential in assessing
ulcerative colitis, where the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) is widely used to
grade inflammation. However, MES classification remains challenging due to
label noise from inter-observer variability and the ordinal nature of the
score, which standard models often ignore. We propose CLoE, a curriculum
learning framework that accounts for both label reliability and ordinal
structure. Image quality, estimated via a lightweight model trained on Boston
Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) labels, is used as a proxy for annotation
confidence to order samples from easy (clean) to hard (noisy). This curriculum
is further combined with ResizeMix augmentation to improve robustness.
Experiments on the LIMUC and HyperKvasir datasets, using both CNNs and
Transformers, show that CLoE consistently improves performance over strong
supervised and self-supervised baselines. For instance, ConvNeXt-Tiny reaches
82.5\% accuracy and a QWK of 0.894 on LIMUC with low computational cost. These
results highlight the potential of difficulty-aware training strategies for
improving ordinal classification under label uncertainty. Code will be released
at https://github.com/zeynepozdemir/CLoE.

*Sirshapan Mitra,Yogesh S. Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaitCrafter是一个基于扩散模型的步态序列生成框架，能够在轮廓域合成逼真的步态数据，支持多种条件控制，并能生成新身份数据以保护隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决步态识别中大规模标注数据缺乏、样本多样性不足以及隐私保护的问题。

Method: 训练视频扩散模型，专门处理步态轮廓数据，支持基于服装、携带物品、视角等多种条件的可控生成，并通过身份嵌入插值生成新身份。

Result: 合成的步态样本能提升识别性能，特别是在挑战性条件下；生成的新身份具有独特且一致的步态模式，可用于训练同时保护真实主体隐私。

Conclusion: 该工作展示了扩散模型在高质量、可控且隐私保护的步态数据生成方面的重要进展。

Abstract: Gait recognition is a valuable biometric task that enables the identification
of individuals from a distance based on their walking patterns. However, it
remains limited by the lack of large-scale labeled datasets and the difficulty
of collecting diverse gait samples for each individual while preserving
privacy. To address these challenges, we propose GaitCrafter, a diffusion-based
framework for synthesizing realistic gait sequences in the silhouette domain.
Unlike prior works that rely on simulated environments or alternative
generative models, GaitCrafter trains a video diffusion model from scratch,
exclusively on gait silhouette data. Our approach enables the generation of
temporally consistent and identity-preserving gait sequences. Moreover, the
generation process is controllable-allowing conditioning on various covariates
such as clothing, carried objects, and view angle. We show that incorporating
synthetic samples generated by GaitCrafter into the gait recognition pipeline
leads to improved performance, especially under challenging conditions.
Additionally, we introduce a mechanism to generate novel identities-synthetic
individuals not present in the original dataset-by interpolating identity
embeddings. These novel identities exhibit unique, consistent gait patterns and
are useful for training models while maintaining privacy of real subjects.
Overall, our work takes an important step toward leveraging diffusion models
for high-quality, controllable, and privacy-aware gait data generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prune2Drive是一个用于自动驾驶多视角视觉语言模型的即插即用视觉token剪枝框架，通过多样性感知token选择机制和视图自适应剪枝控制器，在保持性能的同时显著提升推理速度和减少内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统中的视觉语言模型在处理高分辨率多视角图像时会产生大量视觉token，导致计算开销巨大、推理延迟增加和内存消耗过高，阻碍了实际部署。

Method: 提出两种核心创新：1）受最远点采样启发的多样性感知token选择机制，优先考虑跨视图的语义和空间覆盖；2）视图自适应剪枝控制器，根据各摄像头对下游驾驶任务的重要性学习最优剪枝比例。

Result: 在两个大规模多视角驾驶基准测试上，仅保留10%视觉token时实现了6.4倍预填充阶段加速，FLOPs消耗降至13.4%，性能仅下降3%。

Conclusion: Prune2Drive无需模型重训练或注意力图访问，与现代高效注意力实现兼容，为自动驾驶视觉语言模型的高效部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm in
autonomous driving (AD), offering a unified framework for perception,
reasoning, and decision-making by jointly modeling visual inputs and natural
language instructions. However, their deployment is hindered by the significant
computational overhead incurred when processing high-resolution, multi-view
images, a standard setup in AD systems with six or more synchronized cameras.
This overhead stems from the large number of visual tokens generated during
encoding, increasing inference latency and memory consumption due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. To address these challenges, we propose
Prune2Drive, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for multi-view VLMs
in autonomous driving. Prune2Drive introduces two core innovations: (i) a
diversity-aware token selection mechanism inspired by farthest point sampling,
which prioritizes semantic and spatial coverage across views rather than
relying solely on attention scores, and (ii) a view-adaptive pruning controller
that learns optimal pruning ratios for each camera view based on their
importance to downstream driving tasks. Unlike prior methods, Prune2Drive does
not require model retraining or access to attention maps, making it compatible
with modern efficient attention implementations. Extensive experiments on two
large-scale multi-view driving benchmarks, DriveLM and DriveLMM-o1, show that
Prune2Drive achieves significant speedups and memory savings while maintaining
or improving task performance. When retaining only 10% of the visual tokens,
our method achieves a 6.40$\times$ speedup in the prefilling phase and consumes
13.4% of the original FLOPs, with only a 3% performance drop on the DriveLM
benchmark.

*Abdullah Al Nomaan Nafi,Habibur Rahaman,Zafaryab Haider,Tanzim Mahfuz,Fnu Suya,Swarup Bhunia,Prabuddha Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAASH是一个完全可微的元攻击框架，通过策略性地组合现有的Lp范数攻击方法，生成有效且感知对齐的对抗样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Lp范数约束对抗样本往往与人类感知不一致，且不清楚Lp约束攻击的见解是否能有效提升感知效果。

Method: 多阶段框架：每阶段使用学习到的自适应权重聚合多个基础攻击的候选对抗样本，通过新颖的元损失函数联合最小化误分类损失和感知失真。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet上显著优于最先进的感知攻击AdvAD，攻击成功率提高20.63%，SSIM、LPIPS和FID指标分别提升约11、0.015和5.7。

Conclusion: DAASH能够很好地泛化到未见过的防御方法，是评估鲁棒性的实用且强大的基准，无需为每个新防御手工设计自适应攻击。

Abstract: Numerous techniques have been proposed for generating adversarial examples in
white-box settings under strict Lp-norm constraints. However, such norm-bounded
examples often fail to align well with human perception, and only recently have
a few methods begun specifically exploring perceptually aligned adversarial
examples. Moreover, it remains unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained
attacks can be effectively leveraged to improve perceptual efficacy. In this
paper, we introduce DAASH, a fully differentiable meta-attack framework that
generates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by
strategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods. DAASH operates in a
multi-stage fashion: at each stage, it aggregates candidate adversarial
examples from multiple base attacks using learned, adaptive weights and
propagates the result to the next stage. A novel meta-loss function guides this
process by jointly minimizing misclassification loss and perceptual distortion,
enabling the framework to dynamically modulate the contribution of each base
attack throughout the stages. We evaluate DAASH on adversarially trained models
across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Despite relying solely on
Lp-constrained based methods, DAASH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
perceptual attacks such as AdvAD -- achieving higher attack success rates
(e.g., 20.63\% improvement) and superior visual quality, as measured by SSIM,
LPIPS, and FID (improvements $\approx$ of 11, 0.015, and 5.7, respectively).
Furthermore, DAASH generalizes well to unseen defenses, making it a practical
and strong baseline for evaluating robustness without requiring handcrafted
adaptive attacks for each new defense.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提供可重复、定量的标准来支持数据驱动的手术规划、患者咨询和客观效果评估，解决面部整形外科预后评估缺乏客观标准的问题。

Method: 构建了目前最大的筛选过的手术前后面部图片数据集（7,160张照片，1,259名患者），采用自动化面部标记检测、几何对称性计算、深度学习年龄估计和鼻部形态分析的组合方法。

Result: 在鼻整形子集中，96.2%的患者至少在一个鼻部测量指标上显示改善，其中最大的显著改善包括鼻寬与面宽比例（77.0%）、鼻长与面高比例（41.5%）和鼻寬与眺距比例（39.3%）。在更广泛的正面图患者群中，71.3%显示全局面部对称性或观感年龄的显著改善。

Abstract: We introduce a scalable, interpretable computer-vision framework for
quantifying aesthetic outcomes of facial plastic surgery using frontal
photographs. Our pipeline leverages automated landmark detection, geometric
facial symmetry computation, deep-learning-based age estimation, and nasal
morphology analysis. To perform this study, we first assemble the largest
curated dataset of paired pre- and post-operative facial images to date,
encompassing 7,160 photographs from 1,259 patients. This dataset includes a
dedicated rhinoplasty-only subset consisting of 732 images from 366 patients,
96.2% of whom showed improvement in at least one of the three nasal
measurements with statistically significant group-level change. Among these
patients, the greatest statistically significant improvements (p < 0.001)
occurred in the alar width to face width ratio (77.0%), nose length to face
height ratio (41.5%), and alar width to intercanthal ratio (39.3%). Among the
broader frontal-view cohort, comprising 989 rigorously filtered subjects, 71.3%
exhibited significant enhancements in global facial symmetry or perceived age
(p < 0.01). Importantly, our analysis shows that patient identity remains
consistent post-operatively, with True Match Rates of 99.5% and 99.6% at a
False Match Rate of 0.01% for the rhinoplasty-specific and general patient
cohorts, respectively. Additionally, we analyze inter-practitioner variability
in improvement rates. By providing reproducible, quantitative benchmarks and a
novel dataset, our pipeline facilitates data-driven surgical planning, patient
counseling, and objective outcome evaluation across practices.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗健康领域存在计算成本高、可访问性有限和数据隐私问题，需要寻找更简单易用的解决方案

Method: 使用NIH胸部X光数据集，评估多个小型语言模型在胸部X光位置分类（AP vs PA）任务中的表现，测试三种提示策略：基准指令、逐步摘要提示和修正反思提示

Result: 某些小型语言模型通过精心设计的提示策略能够达到竞争性的准确性

Conclusion: 提示工程可以在不需要深度AI专业知识的情况下实现小型语言模型在医疗健康应用中的性能显著提升

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural
language processing and multi-modal understanding. However, their high
computational cost, limited accessibility, and data privacy concerns hinder
their adoption in resource-constrained healthcare environments. This study
investigates the performance of small language models (SLMs) in a medical
imaging classification task, comparing different models and prompt designs to
identify the optimal combination for accuracy and usability. Using the NIH
Chest X-ray dataset, we evaluate multiple SLMs on the task of classifying chest
X-ray positions (anteroposterior [AP] vs. posteroanterior [PA]) under three
prompt strategies: baseline instruction, incremental summary prompts, and
correction-based reflective prompts. Our results show that certain SLMs achieve
competitive accuracy with well-crafted prompts, suggesting that prompt
engineering can substantially enhance SLM performance in healthcare
applications without requiring deep AI expertise from end users.

*Yunxiang Yang,Ningning Xu,Jidong J. Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过结构化提示和知识蓄纳框架，使用大型视觉-语言模型生成高质量模拟注释，训练出细小的VISTA模型，能够在边缘设备上实现实时交通场景理解和风险分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在可扩展性和通用性方面遇到困难，特别是在复杂动态的真实环境中。需要一种能够自动生成高质量交通场景注释和上下文风险评估的方法。

Result: VISTA模型虽然参数量大幅减少（仅3B规模），但在标准的图像描述指标（BLEU-4、METEOR、ROUGE-L、CIDEr）上表现优异，能够理解低分辨率交通视频并生成语义准确、风险意识的描述。

Conclusion: 有效的知识蓄纳和结构化多代理监督能够让轻量级VLM拥有复杂的推理能力。VISTA的细小架构便于在边缘设备上部署，无需大规模基础设施升级即可实现实时风险监控。

Abstract: Comprehensive highway scene understanding and robust traffic risk inference
are vital for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and
generalization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of
real-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
structured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables
automatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual
risk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models
(VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy
to produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as
knowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much
smaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision
for Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding
low-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware
captions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves
strong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR,
ROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This
demonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent
supervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning
capabilities. The compact architecture of VISTA facilitates efficient
deployment on edge devices, enabling real-time risk monitoring without
requiring extensive infrastructure upgrades.

*Shuai Tan,Bin Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EDTalk++是一个全新的完全解耦框架，用于可控说话头生成，能够独立控制嘴型、头部姿态、眼球运动和表情，支持视频和音频输入。


<details>

Conclusion: EDTalk++提供了一个完整的解耦框架，成功解决了面部特征独立控制和多模态输入共享的问题，在可控说话头生成方面表现出色。

Abstract: Achieving disentangled control over multiple facial motions and accommodating
diverse input modalities greatly enhances the application and entertainment of
the talking head generation. This necessitates a deep exploration of the
decoupling space for facial features, ensuring that they a) operate
independently without mutual interference and b) can be preserved to share with
different modal inputs, both aspects often neglected in existing methods. To
address this gap, this paper proposes EDTalk++, a novel full disentanglement
framework for controllable talking head generation. Our framework enables
individual manipulation of mouth shape, head pose, eye movement, and emotional
expression, conditioned on video or audio inputs. Specifically, we employ four
lightweight modules to decompose the facial dynamics into four distinct latent
spaces representing mouth, pose, eye, and expression, respectively. Each space
is characterized by a set of learnable bases whose linear combinations define
specific motions. To ensure independence and accelerate training, we enforce
orthogonality among bases and devise an efficient training strategy to allocate
motion responsibilities to each space without relying on external knowledge.
The learned bases are then stored in corresponding banks, enabling shared
visual priors with audio input. Furthermore, considering the properties of each
space, we propose an Audio-to-Motion module for audio-driven talking head
synthesis. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of
EDTalk++.

Abstract: Kidney stone classification from endoscopic images is critical for
personalized treatment and recurrence prevention. While convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) have shown promise in this task, their limited ability to
capture long-range dependencies can hinder performance under variable imaging
conditions. This study presents a comparative analysis between Vision
Transformers (ViTs) and CNN-based models, evaluating their performance on two
ex vivo datasets comprising CCD camera and flexible ureteroscope images. The
ViT-base model pretrained on ImageNet-21k consistently outperformed a ResNet50
baseline across multiple imaging conditions. For instance, in the most visually
complex subset (Section patches from endoscopic images), the ViT model achieved
95.2% accuracy and 95.1% F1-score, compared to 64.5% and 59.3% with ResNet50.
In the mixed-view subset from CCD-camera images, ViT reached 87.1% accuracy
versus 78.4% with CNN. These improvements extend across precision and recall as
well. The results demonstrate that ViT-based architectures provide superior
classification performance and offer a scalable alternative to conventional
CNNs for kidney stone image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MINR通过共享中间层来高效编码多张图像，在保持性能的同时减少60%参数，可扩展到处理100张图像


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的隐式神经表示(INR)为每张图像使用单独的MLP网络，导致编码多张图像时计算和存储效率低下

Method: 分析训练好的INR网络层权重分布，发现中间层具有高度相似的分布模式，因此共享中间层而保持输入输出层独立，并为每张图像设计额外的投影层来捕获独特特征

Result: 在图像重建和超分辨率任务中，MINR节省60%参数的同时保持可比性能，可处理100张图像并维持34dB的平均PSNR

Conclusion: MINR方法在多图像编码中具有高效性和可扩展性，在不同骨干网络上都表现出鲁棒性

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) aim to parameterize discrete signals
through implicit continuous functions. However, formulating each image with a
separate neural network~(typically, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)) leads to
computational and storage inefficiencies when encoding multi-images. To address
this issue, we propose MINR, sharing specific layers to encode multi-image
efficiently. We first compare the layer-wise weight distributions for several
trained INRs and find that corresponding intermediate layers follow highly
similar distribution patterns. Motivated by this, we share these intermediate
layers across multiple images while preserving the input and output layers as
input-specific. In addition, we design an extra novel projection layer for each
image to capture its unique features. Experimental results on image
reconstruction and super-resolution tasks demonstrate that MINR can save up to
60\% parameters while maintaining comparable performance. Particularly, MINR
scales effectively to handle 100 images, maintaining an average peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 34 dB. Further analysis of various backbones
proves the robustness of the proposed MINR.

TL;DR: DHQ是一种针对隐式神经表示(INRs)的分布感知哈达玛量化方案，同时量化权重和激活值，通过哈达玛变换将不同分布标准化为统一钟形分布，显著提升硬件效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有INR量化方法主要关注权重量化，缺乏激活值量化，硬件节省有限。INRs中不同层的权重和激活值分布差异显著，需要统一的量化方案。

Method: 提出DHQ方案，利用哈达玛变换将不同层的权重和激活值的多样化分布标准化为统一的钟形分布，然后应用标准量化器，实现权重和激活值的联合量化。

Result: 在图像重建任务中，DHQ相比全精度版本减少延迟32.7%、能耗40.1%、资源使用最高98.3%，优于先前量化方法。

Conclusion: DHQ通过分布感知的哈达玛量化有效解决了INRs中权重和激活值的量化问题，显著提升了硬件效率，为INRs的实际部署提供了可行的量化解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals using
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with complex activation functions. While INRs
achieve superior performance, they depend on full-precision number
representation for accurate computation, resulting in significant hardware
overhead. Previous INR quantization approaches have primarily focused on weight
quantization, offering only limited hardware savings due to the lack of
activation quantization. To fully exploit the hardware benefits of
quantization, we propose DHQ, a novel distribution-aware Hadamard quantization
scheme that targets both weights and activations in INRs. Our analysis shows
that the weights in the first and last layers have distributions distinct from
those in the intermediate layers, while the activations in the last layer
differ significantly from those in the preceding layers. Instead of customizing
quantizers individually, we utilize the Hadamard transformation to standardize
these diverse distributions into a unified bell-shaped form, supported by both
empirical evidence and theoretical analysis, before applying a standard
quantizer. To demonstrate the practical advantages of our approach, we present
an FPGA implementation of DHQ that highlights its hardware efficiency.
Experiments on diverse image reconstruction tasks show that DHQ outperforms
previous quantization methods, reducing latency by 32.7\%, energy consumption
by 40.1\%, and resource utilization by up to 98.3\% compared to full-precision
counterparts.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals in a
continuous manner using neural networks, demonstrating significant value across
various multimedia applications. However, the vulnerability of INRs presents a
critical challenge for their real-world deployments, as the network weights
might be subjected to unavoidable perturbations. In this work, we investigate
the robustness of INRs for the first time and find that even minor
perturbations can lead to substantial performance degradation in the quality of
signal reconstruction. To mitigate this issue, we formulate the robustness
problem in INRs by minimizing the difference between loss with and without
weight perturbations. Furthermore, we derive a novel robust loss function to
regulate the gradient of the reconstruction loss with respect to weights,
thereby enhancing the robustness. Extensive experiments on reconstruction tasks
across multiple modalities demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 7.5~dB
improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values compared to original
INRs under noisy conditions.

Result: 在SAMM、CASME II和MMEW数据集上达到83.75%（UAR）和84.03%（UF1）；在挑战性的CAS(ME)^3数据集上达到51%（UAR）和43.42%（UF1）

Conclusion: FAMNet通过2D和3D CNN的融合以及多任务学习机制，能够有效提取微表情的空间时间特征，显著提升了微表情识别的性能

Abstract: Micro-expressions recognition (MER) has essential application value in many
fields, but the short duration and low intensity of micro-expressions (MEs)
bring considerable challenges to MER. The current MER methods in deep learning
mainly include three data loading methods: static images, dynamic image
sequence, and a combination of the two streams. How to effectively extract MEs'
fine-grained and spatiotemporal features has been difficult to solve. This
paper proposes a new MER method based on multi-task learning and hierarchical
attention, which fully extracts MEs' omni-directional features by merging 2D
and 3D CNNs. The fusion model consists of a 2D CNN AMNet2D and a 3D CNN
AMNet3D, with similar structures consisting of a shared backbone network
Resnet18 and attention modules. During training, the model adopts different
data loading methods to adapt to two specific networks respectively, jointly
trains on the tasks of MER and facial action unit detection (FAUD), and adopts
the parameter hard sharing for information association, which further improves
the effect of the MER task, and the final fused model is called FAMNet.
Extensive experimental results show that our proposed FAMNet significantly
improves task performance. On the SAMM, CASME II and MMEW datasets, FAMNet
achieves 83.75% (UAR) and 84.03% (UF1). Furthermore, on the challenging
CAS(ME)$^3$ dataset, FAMNet achieves 51% (UAR) and 43.42% (UF1).

Conclusion: CORENet相比现有主流方法实现了更优越的性能，训练时仅使用LiDAR进行跨模态监督，推理时完全基于雷达运行

Abstract: 4D radar-based object detection has garnered great attention for its
robustness in adverse weather conditions and capacity to deliver rich spatial
information across diverse driving scenarios. Nevertheless, the sparse and
noisy nature of 4D radar point clouds poses substantial challenges for
effective perception. To address the limitation, we present CORENet, a novel
cross-modal denoising framework that leverages LiDAR supervision to identify
noise patterns and extract discriminative features from raw 4D radar data.
Designed as a plug-and-play architecture, our solution enables seamless
integration into voxel-based detection frameworks without modifying existing
pipelines. Notably, the proposed method only utilizes LiDAR data for
cross-modal supervision during training while maintaining full radar-only
operation during inference. Extensive evaluation on the challenging Dual-Radar
dataset, which is characterized by elevated noise level, demonstrates the
effectiveness of our framework in enhancing detection robustness. Comprehensive
experiments validate that CORENet achieves superior performance compared to
existing mainstream approaches.

Abstract: Multi-view clustering has shown to be an effective method for analyzing
underlying patterns in multi-view data. The performance of clustering can be
improved by learning the consistency and complementarity between multi-view
features, however, cluster-oriented representation learning is often
overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel Bi-level Decoupling and
Consistency Learning framework (BDCL) to further explore the effective
representation for multi-view data to enhance inter-cluster discriminability
and intra-cluster compactness of features in multi-view clustering. Our
framework comprises three modules: 1) The multi-view instance learning module
aligns the consistent information while preserving the private features between
views through reconstruction autoencoder and contrastive learning. 2) The
bi-level decoupling of features and clusters enhances the discriminability of
feature space and cluster space. 3) The consistency learning module treats the
different views of the sample and their neighbors as positive pairs, learns the
consistency of their clustering assignments, and further compresses the
intra-cluster space. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the SOTA
methods. Our code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/BDCL.

TL;DR: 基于强化学习的AdaptiveAE方法，通过动态优化快门速度和ISO组合，在动态场景中实现更高质量的高动态范围图像重建


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HDR技术忽视了快门速度与ISO的复杂交互作用，且未考虑动态场景中的运动模糊效果，导致高ISO产生噪声或长快门引发模糊

Method: 采用强化学习算法，集成包含运动模糊和噪声模拟的图像合成流水线，利用语义信息和曝光直方图来动态选择最优的ISO和快门速度组合

Result: 在多个数据集上达到了目前最好的性能水平，能够根据用户定义的曝光时间预算自适应地选择更好的曝光策略

Conclusion: AdaptiveAE方法有效解决了动态HDR拍摄中的参数优化问题，通过考虑运动模糊和噪声的平衡，实现了更优秀的高动态范围图像重建质量

Abstract: Mainstream high dynamic range imaging techniques typically rely on fusing
multiple images captured with different exposure setups (shutter speed and
ISO). A good balance between shutter speed and ISO is crucial for achieving
high-quality HDR, as high ISO values introduce significant noise, while long
shutter speeds can lead to noticeable motion blur. However, existing methods
often overlook the complex interaction between shutter speed and ISO and fail
to account for motion blur effects in dynamic scenes.
  In this work, we propose AdaptiveAE, a reinforcement learning-based method
that optimizes the selection of shutter speed and ISO combinations to maximize
HDR reconstruction quality in dynamic environments. AdaptiveAE integrates an
image synthesis pipeline that incorporates motion blur and noise simulation
into our training procedure, leveraging semantic information and exposure
histograms. It can adaptively select optimal ISO and shutter speed sequences
based on a user-defined exposure time budget, and find a better exposure
schedule than traditional solutions. Experimental results across multiple
datasets demonstrate that it achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

### [27] [Bridging the Gap: Doubles Badminton Analysis with Singles-Trained Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13507)
*Seungheon Baek,Jinhyuk Yun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种将单打训练模型迁移到双打分析的方法，通过对比学习框架和自定义多目标跟踪算法，成功实现了双打羽毛球中基于姿态的击球识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双打比赛在国际赛事中比单打更普遍，但由于数据可用性和多人跟踪的挑战，先前研究主要集中在单打上。本文旨在填补这一空白，将单打训练的模型扩展到双打分析。

Method: 使用ViT-Pose从ShuttleSet单打数据集中提取关键点，通过基于ST-GCN的对比学习框架进行嵌入。采用自定义多目标跟踪算法解决快速和重叠球员运动导致的ID切换问题，最后使用基于Transformer的分类器进行击球识别。

Result: 研究结果表明，将基于姿态的击球识别扩展到双打羽毛球是可行的，拓宽了分析能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作为双打特定数据集奠定了基础，有助于更好地理解这种主流但研究不足的快节奏球类运动形式。

Abstract: Badminton is known as one of the fastest racket sports in the world. Despite
doubles matches being more prevalent in international tournaments than singles,
previous research has mainly focused on singles due to the challenges in data
availability and multi-person tracking. To address this gap, we designed an
approach that transfers singles-trained models to doubles analysis. We
extracted keypoints from the ShuttleSet single matches dataset using ViT-Pose
and embedded them through a contrastive learning framework based on ST-GCN. To
improve tracking stability, we incorporated a custom multi-object tracking
algorithm that resolves ID switching issues from fast and overlapping player
movements. A Transformer-based classifier then determines shot occurrences
based on the learned embeddings. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of
extending pose-based shot recognition to doubles badminton, broadening
analytics capabilities. This work establishes a foundation for doubles-specific
datasets to enhance understanding of this predominant yet understudied format
of the fast racket sport.

### [28] [2D Gaussians Meet Visual Tokenizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13515)
*Yiang Shi,Xiaoyang Guo,Wei Yin,Mingkai Jia,Qian Zhang,Xiaolin Hu,Wenyu Liu,Xinggang Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的图像标记化器VGQ，通过集成2D高斯分布来改善对几何结构的建模，显著提升了重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的量化基标记化器如VQ-GAN主要关注外观特征（纹理和颜色），忽视了几何结构，导致结构信息编码不足。

Method: 提出Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ)框架，将传统视觉码本量化与2D高斯分布相结合，通过对位置、旋转、缩放等结构参数的直接建模来提升结构表征能力。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256测试上，VGQ达到rFID 1.00。通过增加高斯密度，进一步获得rFID 0.556和PSNR 24.93的独创性能，显著超过现有方法。

Conclusion: VGQ通过高斯量化方案有效地编码了空间结构信息，在保持标记效率的同时大幅提升了重建质量，为AR图像生成提供了更丰富的视觉表征。

Abstract: The image tokenizer is a critical component in AR image generation, as it
determines how rich and structured visual content is encoded into compact
representations. Existing quantization-based tokenizers such as VQ-GAN
primarily focus on appearance features like texture and color, often neglecting
geometric structures due to their patch-based design. In this work, we explored
how to incorporate more visual information into the tokenizer and proposed a
new framework named Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ), a novel tokenizer
paradigm that explicitly enhances structural modeling by integrating 2D
Gaussians into traditional visual codebook quantization frameworks. Our
approach addresses the inherent limitations of naive quantization methods such
as VQ-GAN, which struggle to model structured visual information due to their
patch-based design and emphasis on texture and color. In contrast, VGQ encodes
image latents as 2D Gaussian distributions, effectively capturing geometric and
spatial structures by directly modeling structure-related parameters such as
position, rotation and scale. We further demonstrate that increasing the
density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens leads to significant gains in
reconstruction fidelity, providing a flexible trade-off between token
efficiency and visual richness. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VGQ achieves
strong reconstruction quality with an rFID score of 1.00. Furthermore, by
increasing the density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens, VGQ gains a
significant boost in reconstruction capability and achieves a state-of-the-art
reconstruction rFID score of 0.556 and a PSNR of 24.93, substantially
outperforming existing methods. Codes will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于几何形状知识的分布检验框架，利用基础模型的特征分布跨领域可转移性，在联邦学习和长尾分布识别中有效解决数据异质性和样本不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习中观测样本与真实分布存在差距，这可能由采样偏差、噪声等因素导致。基础模型时代下，需要找到有效方法来调整和检验分布差距。

Method: 利用现成的视觉基础模型（如CLIP、DINOv2）提取特征，发现特征分布的几何形状具有跨领域可转移性。构建几何知识导向的分布检验框架：在联邦学习中获取全局几何形状并生成新样本；在长尾分布中从样本丰富类别转移知识到尾部类别。

Result: 综合实验表明，该几何知识导向的分布检验方法能够有效克服数据异质性和样本不平衡导致的信息缺失问题，在多个标准测试集上都取得了性能提升。

Conclusion: 通过利用基础模型特征分布的几何形状跨领域可转移性，本文提出的方法为解决深度学习中的分布差距问题提供了有效的新角度，在实际应用场景中表现出良好的效果。

Abstract: Despite the fast progress of deep learning, one standing challenge is the gap
of the observed training samples and the underlying true distribution. There
are multiple reasons for the causing of this gap e.g. sampling bias, noise etc.
In the era of foundation models, we show that when leveraging the off-the-shelf
(vision) foundation models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2) for feature extraction, the
geometric shapes of the resulting feature distributions exhibit remarkable
transferability across domains and datasets. To verify its practical
usefulness, we embody our geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
framework in two popular and challenging settings: federated learning and
long-tailed recognition. In the federated setting, we devise a technique of
acquiring the global geometric shape under privacy constraints, then leverage
this knowledge to generate new samples for clients, in the aim of bridging the
gap between local and global observations. In long-tailed learning, it utilizes
the geometric knowledge transferred from sample-rich categories to recover the
true distribution for sample-scarce tail classes. Comprehensive experiments
show that our proposed geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
effectively overcomes information deficits caused by data heterogeneity and
sample imbalance, with boosted performance across benchmarks.

Method: 使用FER-2013数据集，比较Phi-3.5 Vision、CLIP等VLMs与VGG19、ResNet-50、EfficientNet-B0等传统模型，并为解决VLM与噪声数据不匹配问题考虑了GFPGAN图像恢复技术。

Result: 传统模型显著更好：EfficientNet-B0(86.44%)和ResNet-50(85.72%)远超CLIP(64.07%)和Phi-3.5 Vision(51.66%)，显示了VLMs在低质量视觉任务中的局限性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了VLMs需要适应噪声环境，并为情感识别领域的未来研究提供了可复现的基准。

Abstract: Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is crucial for applications such as
human-computer interaction and mental health diagnostics. This study presents
the first empirical comparison of open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
including Phi-3.5 Vision and CLIP, against traditional deep learning models
VGG19, ResNet-50, and EfficientNet-B0 on the challenging FER-2013 dataset,
which contains 35,887 low-resolution grayscale images across seven emotion
classes. To address the mismatch between VLM training assumptions and the noisy
nature of FER data, we introduce a novel pipeline that integrates GFPGAN-based
image restoration with FER evaluation. Results show that traditional models,
particularly EfficientNet-B0 (86.44%) and ResNet-50 (85.72%), significantly
outperform VLMs like CLIP (64.07%) and Phi-3.5 Vision (51.66%), highlighting
the limitations of VLMs in low-quality visual tasks. In addition to performance
evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, we provide a
detailed computational cost analysis covering preprocessing, training,
inference, and evaluation phases, offering practical insights for deployment.
This work underscores the need for adapting VLMs to noisy environments and
provides a reproducible benchmark for future research in emotion recognition.

Motivation: 现有基于3D高斯拖尾的头部虚拟人重建方法在细微面部表情捕捉和局部纹理连续性方面仍面临挑战，特别是在高度可变形区域

Method: 提出EAvatar框架，采用稀疏表情控制机制，用少量关键高斯元影响周围高斯元的变形，同时利用预训练生成模型提供高质量3D先验知识优化面部几何结构

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能够生成更准确、视觉一致的头部重建结果，在表情可控性和细节保真度方面都有显著提升

Conclusion: EAvatar框架通过表情和变形感知设计，有效解决了高保真头部虚拟人重建中的细微表情捕捉和纹理连续性问题，为AR/VR等应用领域提供了更优质的解决方案

Abstract: High-fidelity head avatar reconstruction plays a crucial role in AR/VR,
gaming, and multimedia content creation. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated effectiveness in modeling complex geometry
with real-time rendering capability and are now widely used in high-fidelity
head avatar reconstruction tasks. However, existing 3DGS-based methods still
face significant challenges in capturing fine-grained facial expressions and
preserving local texture continuity, especially in highly deformable regions.
To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS-based framework termed
EAvatar for head reconstruction that is both expression-aware and
deformation-aware. Our method introduces a sparse expression control mechanism,
where a small number of key Gaussians are used to influence the deformation of
their neighboring Gaussians, enabling accurate modeling of local deformations
and fine-scale texture transitions. Furthermore, we leverage high-quality 3D
priors from pretrained generative models to provide a more reliable facial
geometry, offering structural guidance that improves convergence stability and
shape accuracy during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method produces more accurate and visually coherent head reconstructions with
improved expression controllability and detail fidelity.

TL;DR: FLAIR提出了一种频率和局部性感知的隐式神经表示方法，通过RC-GAUSS激活函数和WEGE编码机制解决现有INR方法缺乏频率选择性和空间局部性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐式神经表示(INR)缺乏频率选择性、空间局部性和稀疏表示，导致过度依赖冗余信号分量，表现出频谱偏差，难以捕捉高频细节。

Method: 提出FLAIR方法，包含两个关键创新：1) RC-GAUSS激活函数，在时频不确定性原理约束下实现显式频率选择和空间定位；2) 小波能量引导编码(WEGE)，利用离散小波变换计算能量分数并显式引导频率信息。

Result: 在2D图像表示和恢复以及3D重建任务中，该方法持续优于现有INR方法。

Conclusion: FLAIR通过引入频率选择性和空间局部性机制，有效解决了INR的频谱偏差问题，提升了高频细节的表示能力。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) leverage neural networks to map
coordinates to corresponding signals, enabling continuous and compact
representations. This paradigm has driven significant advances in various
vision tasks. However, existing INRs lack frequency selectivity, spatial
localization, and sparse representations, leading to an over-reliance on
redundant signal components. Consequently, they exhibit spectral bias, tending
to learn low-frequency components early while struggling to capture fine
high-frequency details. To address these issues, we propose FLAIR (Frequency-
and Locality-Aware Implicit Neural Representations), which incorporates two key
innovations. The first is RC-GAUSS, a novel activation designed for explicit
frequency selection and spatial localization under the constraints of the
time-frequency uncertainty principle (TFUP). The second is
Wavelet-Energy-Guided Encoding (WEGE), which leverages the discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to compute energy scores and explicitly guide frequency
information to the network. Our method consistently outperforms existing INRs
in 2D image representation and restoration, as well as 3D reconstruction.

Motivation: 现有的注视点渲染技术需要昂贵的硬件眼动追踪系统，限制了其广泛应用。本文旨在开发无需专用硬件的软件解决方案来降低成本和复杂性。

Method: 结合球形视觉变换器处理360度VR场景和基于LSTM的时序编码器捕捉注视序列模式，通过多模态融合网络整合空间场景特征和时序注视动态来预测未来注视位置。

Result: 在综合VR数据集上的实验显示，GazeProphet达到3.83度的中位角度误差，比传统显著性基线方法提升24%，并提供可靠的置信度校准，在不同空间区域和场景类型中保持一致性。

Conclusion: 软件-only的注视预测可以用于VR注视点渲染，使性能提升更易于在不同VR平台和应用中部署，无需额外硬件要求。

Abstract: Foveated rendering significantly reduces computational demands in virtual
reality applications by concentrating rendering quality where users focus their
gaze. Current approaches require expensive hardware-based eye tracking systems,
limiting widespread adoption due to cost, calibration complexity, and hardware
compatibility constraints. This paper presents GazeProphet, a software-only
approach for predicting gaze locations in VR environments without requiring
dedicated eye tracking hardware. The approach combines a Spherical Vision
Transformer for processing 360-degree VR scenes with an LSTM-based temporal
encoder that captures gaze sequence patterns. A multi-modal fusion network
integrates spatial scene features with temporal gaze dynamics to predict future
gaze locations with associated confidence estimates. Experimental evaluation on
a comprehensive VR dataset demonstrates that GazeProphet achieves a median
angular error of 3.83 degrees, outperforming traditional saliency-based
baselines by 24% while providing reliable confidence calibration. The approach
maintains consistent performance across different spatial regions and scene
types, enabling practical deployment in VR systems without additional hardware
requirements. Statistical analysis confirms the significance of improvements
across all evaluation metrics. These results show that software-only gaze
prediction can work for VR foveated rendering, making this performance boost
more accessible to different VR platforms and apps.

Conclusion: 该方法能够支持生成式人脸视频编码在移动边缘设备等资源受限环境中的高效部署

Abstract: Generative Face Video Coding (GFVC) achieves superior rate-distortion
performance by leveraging the strong inference capabilities of deep generative
models. However, its practical deployment is hindered by large model parameters
and high computational costs. To address this, we propose a lightweight GFVC
framework that introduces dual-mode optimization -- combining architectural
redesign and operational refinement -- to reduce complexity whilst preserving
reconstruction quality. Architecturally, we replace traditional 3 x 3
convolutions with slimmer and more efficient layers, reducing complexity
without compromising feature expressiveness. Operationally, we develop a
two-stage adaptive channel pruning strategy: (1) soft pruning during training
identifies redundant channels via learnable thresholds, and (2) hard pruning
permanently eliminates these channels post-training using a derived mask. This
dual-phase approach ensures both training stability and inference efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed lightweight dual-mode
optimization for GFVC can achieve 90.4% parameter reduction and 88.9%
computation saving compared to the baseline, whilst achieving superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video
Coding (VVC) in terms of perceptual-level quality metrics. As such, the
proposed method is expected to enable efficient GFVC deployment in
resource-constrained environments such as mobile edge devices.

Abstract: In recent years, neuromorphic computing and spiking neural networks (SNNs)
have ad-vanced rapidly through integration with deep learning. However, the
performance of SNNs still lags behind that of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), primarily due to the limited information capacity of spike-based data.
Although some studies have attempted to improve SNN performance by training
them with non-spiking inputs such as static images, this approach deviates from
the original intent of neuromorphic computing, which emphasizes spike-based
information processing. To address this issue, we propose a Neuron-like
Encoding method that generates spike data based on the intrinsic operational
principles and functions of biological neurons. This method is further enhanced
by the incorporation of an artificial pho-toreceptor layer, enabling spike data
to carry both color and luminance information, thereby forming a complete
visual spike signal. Experimental results using the Integrate-and-Fire neuron
model demonstrate that this biologically inspired approach effectively
increases the information content of spike signals and improves SNN
performance, all while adhering to neuromorphic principles. We believe this
concept holds strong potential for future development and may contribute to
overcoming current limitations in neuro-morphic computing, facilitating broader
applications of SNNs.

TL;DR: DictAS是一个新颖的少样本异常分割框架，通过自监督字典查找机制实现跨类别泛化，无需目标数据重新训练，仅使用少量正常参考图像作为视觉提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在少样本异常分割中的跨类别泛化能力严重依赖已知异常样本的先验知识，需要开发不依赖真实异常样本记忆的新方法。

Method: 提出三组件框架：1）字典构建-用正常参考图像特征模拟字典索引和内容；2）字典查找-通过稀疏查找策略检索查询区域特征，无法检索的特征判为异常；3）查询判别正则化-通过对比查询约束和文本对齐约束增强异常判别能力。

Result: 在7个工业和医学数据集上的广泛实验表明，DictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSAS methods。

Conclusion: DictAS通过自监督字典查找机制成功实现了无需重新训练的跨类别异常检测，为少样本异常分割提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have demonstrated remarkable
class-generalizable ability to unseen classes in few-shot anomaly segmentation
(FSAS), leveraging supervised prompt learning or fine-tuning on seen classes.
However, their cross-category generalization largely depends on prior knowledge
of real seen anomaly samples. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,
namely DictAS, which enables a unified model to detect visual anomalies in
unseen object categories without any retraining on the target data, only
employing a few normal reference images as visual prompts. The insight behind
DictAS is to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the FSAS task for
unseen classes via self-supervised learning, instead of merely memorizing the
normal and abnormal feature patterns from the training set. Specifically,
DictAS mainly consists of three components: (1) **Dictionary Construction** -
to simulate the index and content of a real dictionary using features from
normal reference images. (2) **Dictionary Lookup** - to retrieve queried region
features from the dictionary via a sparse lookup strategy. When a query feature
cannot be retrieved, it is classified as an anomaly. (3) **Query Discrimination
Regularization**- to enhance anomaly discrimination by making abnormal features
harder to retrieve from the dictionary. To achieve this, Contrastive Query
Constraint and Text Alignment Constraint are further proposed. Extensive
experiments on seven public industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that
DictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSAS methods.

Motivation: SMPLify在3D人体姿态和形状估计中作为鲁棒基准，但其迭代优化过程计算成本高，限制了实用性。受跨领域进展启发，用数据驱动的神经网络替代迭代优化可以在不牺牲精度的情况下显著提升运行速度。

Method: 提出可学习的SMPLify框架，采用时序采样策略构建初始化-目标对进行训练，使用人体中心归一化方案和残差学习来缩小解空间，支持序列推理和插件式后处理。

Conclusion: Learnable SMPLify建立了一个实用且简单的基准，显著提升了3D人体姿态估计的效率，同时保持了良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: In 3D human pose and shape estimation, SMPLify remains a robust baseline that
solves inverse kinematics (IK) through iterative optimization. However, its
high computational cost limits its practicality. Recent advances across domains
have shown that replacing iterative optimization with data-driven neural
networks can achieve significant runtime improvements without sacrificing
accuracy. Motivated by this trend, we propose Learnable SMPLify, a neural
framework that replaces the iterative fitting process in SMPLify with a
single-pass regression model. The design of our framework targets two core
challenges in neural IK: data construction and generalization. To enable
effective training, we propose a temporal sampling strategy that constructs
initialization-target pairs from sequential frames. To improve generalization
across diverse motions and unseen poses, we propose a human-centric
normalization scheme and residual learning to narrow the solution space.
Learnable SMPLify supports both sequential inference and plug-in
post-processing to refine existing image-based estimators. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method establishes itself as a practical and
simple baseline: it achieves nearly 200x faster runtime compared to SMPLify,
generalizes well to unseen 3DPW and RICH, and operates in a model-agnostic
manner when used as a plug-in tool on LucidAction. The code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法通过有效利用特征语义，为高性能物联网应用提供了鲁棒且可扩展的智能视频分析解决方案。

Abstract: Video action analysis is a foundational technology within the realm of
intelligent video comprehension, particularly concerning its application in
Internet of Things(IoT). However, existing methodologies overlook feature
semantics in feature extraction and focus on optimizing action proposals, thus
these solutions are unsuitable for widespread adoption in high-performance IoT
applications due to the limitations in precision, such as autonomous driving,
which necessitate robust and scalable intelligent video analytics analysis. To
address this issue, we propose a novel generative attention-based model to
learn the relation of feature semantics. Specifically, by leveraging the
differences of actions' foreground and background, our model simultaneously
learns the frame- and segment-dependencies of temporal action feature
semantics, which takes advantage of feature semantics in the feature extraction
effectively. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive
experiments on two benchmark video task, action recognition and action
detection. In the context of action detection tasks, we substantiate the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现现有RVOS方法过于关注特征提取和时序模型，而忽视了分割头的设计，分割头设计仍有很大改进空间

Method: 提出时序条件引用视频对象分割模型，集成现有分割方法提升边界分割能力；使用文本到视频涵散模型进行特征提取，移除噪声预测模块减少随机性；设计时序上下文提炼模块充分利用时序信息

Result: 在四个公开RVOS测试集上均达到了最先进的性能水平

Conclusion: 通过重新关注分割头设计和时序上下文利用，可以在不增加复杂性的情况下显著提升引用视频对象分割的质量

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment specific objects
in a video according to textual descriptions. We observe that recent RVOS
approaches often place excessive emphasis on feature extraction and temporal
modeling, while relatively neglecting the design of the segmentation head. In
fact, there remains considerable room for improvement in segmentation head
design. To address this, we propose a Temporal-Conditional Referring Video
Object Segmentation model, which innovatively integrates existing segmentation
methods to effectively enhance boundary segmentation capability. Furthermore,
our model leverages a text-to-video diffusion model for feature extraction. On
top of this, we remove the traditional noise prediction module to avoid the
randomness of noise from degrading segmentation accuracy, thereby simplifying
the model while improving performance. Finally, to overcome the limited feature
extraction capability of the VAE, we design a Temporal Context Mask Refinement
(TCMR) module, which significantly improves segmentation quality without
introducing complex designs. We evaluate our method on four public RVOS
benchmarks, where it consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的域适应管道，将晴朗天气图像转换为雾、雨、雪和夜间图像，通过混合扩散-GAN方法生成逼真的恶劣天气图像，提升自动驾驶系统在恶劣环境下的感知性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统在恶劣环境条件下性能显著下降，但由于恶劣天气数据获取和标注成本高昂，数据集代表性不足，需要一种低成本的数据增强方法。

Method: 开发了多种数据生成管道（模拟、GAN、混合扩散-GAN），扩展现有DA GAN支持辅助输入，结合模拟和真实图像训练，并引入自适应混合方法减少Stable-Diffusion输出中的幻觉和伪影。

Result: 在ACDC数据集上语义分割整体提升1.85%，夜间场景提升4.62%，证明了混合方法在恶劣条件下提升自动驾驶感知鲁棒性的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的混合域适应方法能够有效生成逼真的恶劣天气图像，显著改善自动驾驶系统在挑战性环境条件下的感知性能，为解决数据稀缺问题提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems exhibit markedly degraded performance under
adverse environmental conditions, such as low illumination and precipitation.
The underrepresentation of adverse conditions in AD datasets makes it
challenging to address this deficiency. To circumvent the prohibitive cost of
acquiring and annotating adverse weather data, we propose a novel Domain
Adaptation (DA) pipeline that transforms clear-weather images into fog, rain,
snow, and nighttime images. Here, we systematically develop and evaluate
several novel data-generation pipelines, including simulation-only, GAN-based,
and hybrid diffusion-GAN approaches, to synthesize photorealistic adverse
images from labelled clear images. We leverage an existing DA GAN, extend it to
support auxiliary inputs, and develop a novel training recipe that leverages
both simulated and real images. The simulated images facilitate exact
supervision by providing perfectly matched image pairs, while the real images
help bridge the simulation-to-real (sim2real) gap. We further introduce a
method to mitigate hallucinations and artifacts in Stable-Diffusion
Image-to-Image (img2img) outputs by blending them adaptively with their
progenitor images. We finetune downstream models on our synthetic data and
evaluate them on the Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences (ACDC). We
achieve 1.85 percent overall improvement in semantic segmentation, and 4.62
percent on nighttime, demonstrating the efficacy of our hybrid method for
robust AD perception under challenging conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MaMe是一种专门为基于状态空间模型(SSM)的视觉模型设计的token合并策略，通过利用状态转移参数Δ量化token重要性并保持序列信息流，在保持性能的同时显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 状态空间模型在计算机视觉中表现出强大能力，但计算效率仍是实际部署的关键挑战。现有token缩减方法未充分考虑SSM特有的序列建模特性，需要专门设计适合SSM的token合并策略。

Method: 提出MaMe token合并策略：1) 利用状态转移参数Δ作为信息重要性度量指标；2) 引入战略性token排列以保持序列信息流；3) 针对SSM的序列特性进行优化设计。

Result: 实验表明MaMe在效率和性能之间达到优越平衡，即使在激进token缩减下仍保持鲁棒性。在图像分类、视频和音频等多个领域都展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MaMe为SSM模型提供了一种有效的token合并方法，解决了token重要性量化和序列特性保持两个关键挑战，为多样化SSM应用的高效部署奠定了基础。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as powerful architectures in computer
vision, yet improving their computational efficiency remains crucial for
practical and scalable deployment.While token reduction serves as an effective
approach for model efficiency, applying it to SSMs requires careful
consideration of their unique sequential modeling capabilities.In this work, we
propose MaMe, a token-merging strategy tailored for SSM-based vision
models.MaMe addresses two key challenges: quantifying token importance and
preserving sequential properties. Our approach leverages the state transition
parameter $\mathbf{\Delta}$ as an informativeness measure and introduces
strategic token arrangements to preserve sequential information flow.Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MaMe achieves superior efficiency-performance
trade-offs for both fine-tuned and off-the-shelf models. Particularly, our
approach maintains robustness even under aggressive token reduction where
existing methods undergo significant performance degradation.Beyond image
classification, MaMe shows strong generalization capabilities across video and
audio domains, establishing an effective approach for enhancing efficiency in
diverse SSM applications.

Motivation: 现有方法使用耦合编码器来处理语义和几何优先信息，导致模型在矛盾需求之间做出折衷，限制了整体性能

Method: 提出基础编码器提供丰富语义特征优先和高保真立体成本体积；通过解耦途径精炼优先信息；使用混合视图变换生成补充的3D特征；引入轴向感知融合模块实现各异性融合

Result: 在SemanticKITTI上较之前最佳方法提升+0.23 mIoU和+2.03 IoU；在SSCBench-KITTI-360上达到状态最佳性能，分别为21.78 mIoU和48.61 IoU

Conclusion: 双重解耦设计能够有效地解决语义与几何优先信息的矛盾问题，为摄像头基于3D语义场景完成领域提供了更加高效的解决方案

Abstract: Camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) provides dense geometric and
semantic perception for autonomous driving and robotic navigation. However,
existing methods rely on a coupled encoder to deliver both semantic and
geometric priors, which forces the model to make a trade-off between
conflicting demands and limits its overall performance. To tackle these
challenges, we propose FoundationSSC, a novel framework that performs dual
decoupling at both the source and pathway levels. At the source level, we
introduce a foundation encoder that provides rich semantic feature priors for
the semantic branch and high-fidelity stereo cost volumes for the geometric
branch. At the pathway level, these priors are refined through specialised,
decoupled pathways, yielding superior semantic context and depth distributions.
Our dual-decoupling design produces disentangled and refined inputs, which are
then utilised by a hybrid view transformation to generate complementary 3D
features. Additionally, we introduce a novel Axis-Aware Fusion (AAF) module
that addresses the often-overlooked challenge of fusing these features by
anisotropically merging them into a unified representation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the advantages of FoundationSSC, achieving simultaneous
improvements in both semantic and geometric metrics, surpassing prior bests by
+0.23 mIoU and +2.03 IoU on SemanticKITTI. Additionally, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance on SSCBench-KITTI-360, with 21.78 mIoU and 48.61
IoU. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: With the growing demand for short videos and personalized content, automated
Video Log (Vlog) generation has become a key direction in multimodal content
creation. Existing methods mostly rely on predefined scripts, lacking dynamism
and personal expression. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an automated
Vlog generation approach that enables effective multimodal collaboration and
high personalization. To this end, we propose PersonaVlog, an automated
multimodal stylized Vlog generation framework that can produce personalized
Vlogs featuring videos, background music, and inner monologue speech based on a
given theme and reference image. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent
collaboration framework based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This
framework efficiently generates high-quality prompts for multimodal content
creation based on user input, thereby improving the efficiency and creativity
of the process. In addition, we incorporate a feedback and rollback mechanism
that leverages MLLMs to evaluate and provide feedback on generated results,
thereby enabling iterative self-correction of multimodal content. We also
propose ThemeVlogEval, a theme-based automated benchmarking framework that
provides standardized metrics and datasets for fair evaluation. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the significant advantages and potential of our
framework over several baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and great
potential for generating automated Vlogs.

Abstract: Face mask detection has become increasingly important recently, particularly
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many face detection models have been developed in
smart entryways using IoT. However, there is a lack of IoT development on face
mask detection. This paper proposes a two-factor authentication system for
smart entryway access control using facial recognition and passcode
verification and an automation process to alert the owner and activate the
surveillance system when a stranger is detected and controls the system
remotely via Telegram on a Raspberry Pi platform. The system employs the Local
Binary Patterns Histograms for the full face recognition algorithm and modified
LBPH algorithm for occluded face detection. On average, the system achieved an
Accuracy of approximately 70%, a Precision of approximately 80%, and a Recall
of approximately 83.26% across all tested users. The results indicate that the
system is capable of conducting face recognition and mask detection, automating
the operation of the remote control to register users, locking or unlocking the
door, and notifying the owner. The sample participants highly accept it for
future use in the user acceptance test.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频驱动说话头合成模型在人类多样性（种族、语言、年龄）方面缺乏泛化能力，这主要是由于训练数据在规模、质量和多样性方面的局限性。

Method: 通过多阶段自动化流水线精心筛选运动稳定性、美学质量和面部细节，构建TalkVid数据集，并创建分层评估集TalkVid-Bench（500个片段），在关键人口统计和语言维度上保持平衡。

Result: 在TalkVid上训练的模型优于在先前数据集上训练的模型，表现出更好的跨数据集泛化能力。TalkVid-Bench分析揭示了传统聚合指标掩盖的性能差异。

Conclusion: TalkVid数据集解决了音频驱动说话头合成中的多样性泛化问题，TalkVid-Bench评估集对于未来研究至关重要，能够揭示不同子群体间的性能差异。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head synthesis has achieved remarkable photorealism, yet
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models exhibit a critical failure: they lack
generalization to the full spectrum of human diversity in ethnicity, language,
and age groups. We argue that this generalization gap is a direct symptom of
limitations in existing training data, which lack the necessary scale, quality,
and diversity. To address this challenge, we introduce TalkVid, a new
large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset containing 1244 hours of video
from 7729 unique speakers. TalkVid is curated through a principled, multi-stage
automated pipeline that rigorously filters for motion stability, aesthetic
quality, and facial detail, and is validated against human judgments to ensure
its reliability. Furthermore, we construct and release TalkVid-Bench, a
stratified evaluation set of 500 clips meticulously balanced across key
demographic and linguistic axes. Our experiments demonstrate that a model
trained on TalkVid outperforms counterparts trained on previous datasets,
exhibiting superior cross-dataset generalization. Crucially, our analysis on
TalkVid-Bench reveals performance disparities across subgroups that are
obscured by traditional aggregate metrics, underscoring its necessity for
future research. Code and data can be found in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs在识别图像旋转角度方面表现不佳，特别是无法可靠区分90度和270度旋转，即使提供辅助信息或微调也效果有限，揭示了MLLMs空间推理能力与人类感知之间的显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）识别图像旋转方向的能力，评估其在视觉空间推理方面的表现，因为这项任务需要检测旋转线索并在不同方向下理解空间关系。

Method: 引入RotBench基准测试（包含350张手动筛选的生活、肖像和风景图像），测试多个先进MLLMs（包括GPT-5、o3和Gemini-2.5-Pro）识别0°、90°、180°、270°旋转的能力，使用辅助信息（标题、深度图等）和思维链提示进行改进尝试。

Result: 大多数模型能可靠识别正立（0°）图像，部分能识别倒立（180°）图像，但都无法可靠区分90°和270°旋转。提供辅助信息或思维链提示只有微小且不一致的改进。同时显示不同旋转方向的图像对推理模型有中等提升，投票机制能改善较弱模型的性能。微调无法改善90°/270°区分能力。

Conclusion: MLLMs在图像旋转识别任务中存在显著局限性，特别是在区分90°和270°旋转方面，这表明其空间推理能力与人类感知存在明显差距，需要进一步研究来提升这方面的能力。

Abstract: We investigate to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can
accurately identify the orientation of input images rotated 0{\deg}, 90{\deg},
180{\deg}, and 270{\deg}. This task demands robust visual reasoning
capabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships
within images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these
abilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark
comprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively
simple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and
proprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably
identify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information
-- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought
prompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate
that most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\deg}) images,
while certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\deg}) images. None
can reliably distinguish between 90{\deg} and 270{\deg}. Simultaneously showing
the image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains
for reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the
performance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve
models' ability to distinguish 90{\deg} and 270{\deg} rotations, despite
substantially improving the identification of 180{\deg} images. Together, these
results reveal a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities
and human perception in identifying rotation.

Conclusion: 该方法为仅使用RGB图像的类别级物体始位估计领域提供了新的研究视角和有前景的解决方案

Abstract: While most current RGB-D-based category-level object pose estimation methods
achieve strong performance, they face significant challenges in scenes lacking
depth information. In this paper, we propose a novel category-level object pose
estimation approach that relies solely on RGB images. This method enables
accurate pose estimation in real-world scenarios without the need for depth
data. Specifically, we design a transformer-based neural network for
category-level object pose estimation, where the transformer is employed to
predict and fuse the geometric features of the target object. To ensure that
these predicted geometric features faithfully capture the object's geometry, we
introduce a geometric feature-guided algorithm, which enhances the network's
ability to effectively represent the object's geometric information. Finally,
we utilize the RANSAC-PnP algorithm to compute the object's pose, addressing
the challenges associated with variable object scales in pose estimation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach is not
only highly efficient but also achieves superior accuracy compared to previous
RGB-based methods. These promising results offer a new perspective for
advancing category-level object pose estimation using RGB images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然通过CFG在多个领域展现了出色的生成性能，但生成样本质量对引导权重的选择高度敏感。作者发现这是由于训练和推理阶段之间存在差距，这个差距影响了条件生成性能并导致输出对引导权重敏感。

Method: 提出了DiffIER方法，这是一种基于优化的高质量生成方法。通过在推理阶段的每个步骤进行迭代误差最小化，有效减少累积误差。该方法是一个即插即用的优化框架，可以在每个推理步骤优化误差。

Result: 实证结果表明，该方法在条件生成任务中优于基线方法。在文本到图像生成、图像超分辨率和文本到语音生成等多个任务中都取得了持续的成功。

Conclusion: DiffIER方法通过解决训练-推理差距问题，显著提高了扩散模型的生成质量，展现了其多功能性和在未来研究中的广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality samples and enhancing performance across diverse domains through
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, the quality of generated samples is
highly sensitive to the selection of the guidance weight. In this work, we
identify a critical ``training-inference gap'' and we argue that it is the
presence of this gap that undermines the performance of conditional generation
and renders outputs highly sensitive to the guidance weight. We quantify this
gap by measuring the accumulated error during the inference stage and establish
a correlation between the selection of guidance weight and minimizing this gap.
Furthermore, to mitigate this gap, we propose DiffIER, an optimization-based
method for high-quality generation. We demonstrate that the accumulated error
can be effectively reduced by an iterative error minimization at each step
during inference. By introducing this novel plug-and-play optimization
framework, we enable the optimization of errors at every single inference step
and enhance generation quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed
method outperforms baseline approaches in conditional generation tasks.
Furthermore, the method achieves consistent success in text-to-image
generation, image super-resolution, and text-to-speech generation, underscoring
its versatility and potential for broad applications in future research.

Conclusion: OmniTry成功扩展了虚拟试穿的应用范围，解决了数据稀缺问题，为各种可穿戴物品提供了实用的试穿解决方案。

Abstract: Virtual Try-ON (VTON) is a practical and widely-applied task, for which most
of existing works focus on clothes. This paper presents OmniTry, a unified
framework that extends VTON beyond garment to encompass any wearable objects,
e.g., jewelries and accessories, with mask-free setting for more practical
application. When extending to various types of objects, data curation is
challenging for obtaining paired images, i.e., the object image and the
corresponding try-on result. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-staged
pipeline: For the first stage, we leverage large-scale unpaired images, i.e.,
portraits with any wearable items, to train the model for mask-free
localization. Specifically, we repurpose the inpainting model to automatically
draw objects in suitable positions given an empty mask. For the second stage,
the model is further fine-tuned with paired images to transfer the consistency
of object appearance. We observed that the model after the first stage shows
quick convergence even with few paired samples. OmniTry is evaluated on a
comprehensive benchmark consisting of 12 common classes of wearable objects,
with both in-shop and in-the-wild images. Experimental results suggest that
OmniTry shows better performance on both object localization and
ID-preservation compared with existing methods. The code, model weights, and
evaluation benchmark of OmniTry will be made publicly available at

Motivation: 现有方法存在局限性：基于分割的方法在矢量化后处理中难以保持拓扑保真度；图增长方法计算成本高；图生成方法限制了顶点的动态插入。需要一种既能保持拓扑保真度又具有高效推理速度的方法。

Method: 将任务解耦为候选顶点检测、相邻顶点预测、初始图构建和图扩展四个步骤，通过这种架构创新实现动态顶点（边）插入，同时保持快速推理速度。

Conclusion: DeH4R成功解决了道路网络提取中的拓扑保真度和计算效率之间的权衡问题，为遥感图像分析提供了高效准确的解决方案。

Abstract: The automated extraction of complete and precise road network graphs from
remote sensing imagery remains a critical challenge in geospatial computer
vision. Segmentation-based approaches, while effective in pixel-level
recognition, struggle to maintain topology fidelity after vectorization
postprocessing. Graph-growing methods build more topologically faithful graphs
but suffer from computationally prohibitive iterative ROI cropping.
Graph-generating methods first predict global static candidate road network
vertices, and then infer possible edges between vertices. They achieve fast
topology-aware inference, but limits the dynamic insertion of vertices. To
address these challenges, we propose DeH4R, a novel hybrid model that combines
graph-generating efficiency and graph-growing dynamics. This is achieved by
decoupling the task into candidate vertex detection, adjacent vertex
prediction, initial graph contruction, and graph expansion. This architectural
innovation enables dynamic vertex (edge) insertions while retaining fast
inference speed and enhancing both topology fidelity and spatial consistency.
Comprehensive evaluations on CityScale and SpaceNet benchmarks demonstrate
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. DeH4R outperforms the prior SOTA
graph-growing method RNGDet++ by 4.62 APLS and 10.18 IoU on CityScale, while
being approximately 10 $\times$ faster. The code will be made publicly

extracting context beyond question cues, and applying human-like expertise.
Each question includes human-annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales with
key visual evidence to support further research. Extensive evaluations on over
30 state-of-the-art models exhibit significant challenges in human-centric
visual understanding, particularly in tasks involving detailed space
perception, temporal understanding, and mind modeling. Moreover, analysis of
Human-R reveals the struggle of models in extracting essential proactive visual
evidence from diverse human scenes and their faulty reliance on query-guided
retrieval. Even with advanced techniques like scaling visual contexts and
test-time thinking yield only limited benefits. We hope HumanPCR and our
findings will advance the development, evaluation, and human-centric
application of multimodal models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DCMamba框架，从数据、网络和特征三个角度增强多样性，用于半监督医学图像分割，在Synapse数据集上比现有方法提升6.69%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像标注成本高且耗时，半监督分割技术通过利用未标注数据生成伪标签来缓解这个问题。最新的状态空间模型Mamba在处理长程依赖方面表现出色，值得在半监督医学图像分割中探索其潜力

Method: 1) 数据层面：开发基于Mamba扫描特性的patch级弱-强混合增强；2) 网络层面：引入多样化扫描协作模块，利用不同扫描方向的预测差异；3) 特征层面：采用不确定性加权的对比学习机制增强特征表示多样性

Result: 在Synapse数据集上，使用20%标注数据时，DCMamba显著优于其他半监督医学图像分割方法，比最新的SSM-based方法提升6.69%

Conclusion: DCMamba框架通过从多个角度探索和利用多样性，在半监督医学图像分割任务中取得了优异性能，证明了Mamba模型在该领域的应用潜力

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality annotated data for medical image segmentation is
tedious and costly. Semi-supervised segmentation techniques alleviate this
burden by leveraging unlabeled data to generate pseudo labels. Recently,
advanced state space models, represented by Mamba, have shown efficient
handling of long-range dependencies. This drives us to explore their potential
in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a
novel Diversity-enhanced Collaborative Mamba framework (namely DCMamba) for
semi-supervised medical image segmentation, which explores and utilizes the
diversity from data, network, and feature perspectives. Firstly, from the data
perspective, we develop patch-level weak-strong mixing augmentation with
Mamba's scanning modeling characteristics. Moreover, from the network
perspective, we introduce a diverse-scan collaboration module, which could
benefit from the prediction discrepancies arising from different scanning
directions. Furthermore, from the feature perspective, we adopt an
uncertainty-weighted contrastive learning mechanism to enhance the diversity of
feature representation. Experiments demonstrate that our DCMamba significantly
outperforms other semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods, e.g.,
yielding the latest SSM-based method by 6.69% on the Synapse dataset with 20%
labeled data.

TL;DR: 提出了一个包含457个农业主题虚拟博物馆的新数据集和分层视觉语言模型，用于通过自然语言查询检索相关农业元宇宙内容，在实验中达到62% R@1和78% MRR的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线教育内容快速增长但缺乏有效组织，元宇宙可以提供沉浸式学习体验，但现有数据集小且检索相关元宇宙场景仍具挑战性。

Method: 引入AgriMuseums数据集，并提出分层视觉语言模型来表示和检索农业主题虚拟博物馆。

Result: 所提方法达到约62% R@1和78% MRR，在现有基准上提升6% R@1和11% MRR，广泛评估验证了设计选择。

Conclusion: 该工作为农业元宇宙内容检索提供了有效的数据集和模型，显著提升了检索性能。

Abstract: Every day, a large amount of educational content is uploaded online across
different areas, including agriculture and gardening. When these videos or
materials are grouped meaningfully, they can make learning easier and more
effective. One promising way to organize and enrich such content is through the
Metaverse, which allows users to explore educational experiences in an
interactive and immersive environment. However, searching for relevant
Metaverse scenarios and finding those matching users' interests remains a
challenging task. A first step in this direction has been done recently, but
existing datasets are small and not sufficient for training advanced models. In
this work, we make two main contributions: first, we introduce a new dataset
containing 457 agricultural-themed virtual museums (AgriMuseums), each enriched
with textual descriptions; and second, we propose a hierarchical
vision-language model to represent and retrieve relevant AgriMuseums using
natural language queries. In our experimental setting, the proposed method
achieves up to about 62\% R@1 and 78\% MRR, confirming its effectiveness, and
it also leads to improvements on existing benchmarks by up to 6\% R@1 and 11\%
MRR. Moreover, an extensive evaluation validates our design choices. Code and

*Yiming Cao,Yanjie Li,Kaisheng Liang,Yuni Lai,Bin Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IPGA是一种针对视觉语言模型的对抗攻击方法，通过利用投影器模块中间阶段的语义信息，实现更精细的图像操控，在保持背景的同时修改特定目标，并在黑盒环境中表现出优越的攻击效果和跨模型迁移能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法在图像层面进行全局相似度最大化，将丰富的视觉语义压缩为单一全局向量，限制了攻击的精细度，无法实现细粒度操控（如修改汽车但保持背景），且忽视了投影器模块在视觉-语言对齐中的关键作用。

Method: 提出IPGA方法，首次利用投影器模块（特别是Q-Former）的中间阶段进行攻击，将全局图像嵌入转换为细粒度视觉特征；利用仅在第一阶段预训练的Q-Former提升攻击效果和迁移性；提出残差查询对齐（RQA）技术来保持无关视觉内容。

Result: 在标准全局图像描述任务和细粒度视觉问答任务中，IPGA在黑盒环境下 consistently 优于现有方法；成功迁移到多个商业VLM（Google Gemini和OpenAI GPT）。

Conclusion: IPGA通过利用投影器中间阶段的语义信息，实现了更精确和可控的对抗攻击，证明了在视觉-语言对齐管道中攻击中间阶段的重要性，为VLM安全性评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Targeted adversarial attacks are essential for proactively identifying
security flaws in Vision-Language Models before real-world deployment. However,
current methods perturb images to maximize global similarity with the target
text or reference image at the encoder level, collapsing rich visual semantics
into a single global vector. This limits attack granularity, hindering
fine-grained manipulations such as modifying a car while preserving its
background. Furthermore, these methods largely overlook the projector module, a
critical semantic bridge between the visual encoder and the language model in
VLMs, thereby failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline
within VLMs and limiting attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), the first method to
attack using the intermediate stage of the projector module, specifically the
widely adopted Q-Former, which transforms global image embeddings into
fine-grained visual features. This enables more precise control over
adversarial perturbations by operating on semantically meaningful visual tokens
rather than a single global representation. Specifically, IPGA leverages the
Q-Former pretrained solely on the first vision-language alignment stage,
without LLM fine-tuning, which improves both attack effectiveness and
transferability across diverse VLMs. Furthermore, we propose Residual Query
Alignment (RQA) to preserve unrelated visual content, thereby yielding more
controlled and precise adversarial manipulations. Extensive experiments show
that our attack method consistently outperforms existing methods in both
standard global image captioning tasks and fine-grained visual
question-answering tasks in black-box environment. Additionally, IPGA
successfully transfers to multiple commercial VLMs, including Google Gemini and
OpenAI GPT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCUS是一种无需训练的解码策略，通过顺序掩码图像来缓解多图像输入时的信息泄漏问题，显著提升多图像推理性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在单图像任务上表现良好，但在处理多图像输入时性能显著下降，因为不同图像的视觉线索在模型输出中相互干扰，出现跨图像信息泄漏现象

Method: 提出FOCUS解码策略：1）顺序用随机噪声掩码除一张图像外的所有图像；2）重复此过程获得部分掩码上下文下的logits；3）聚合logits并使用纯噪声参考输入进行对比精炼

Result: FOCUS在四个多图像基准测试和多种LVLM模型家族中一致提升性能

Conclusion: FOCUS提供了一种通用且实用的解决方案，无需额外训练或架构修改即可增强多图像推理能力

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong performance on
single-image tasks. However, we observe that their performance degrades
significantly when handling multi-image inputs. This occurs because visual cues
from different images become entangled in the model's output. We refer to this
phenomenon as cross-image information leakage. To address this issue, we
propose FOCUS, a training-free and architecture-agnostic decoding strategy that
mitigates cross-image information leakage during inference. FOCUS sequentially
masks all but one image with random noise, guiding the model to focus on the
single clean image. We repeat this process across all target images to obtain
logits under partially masked contexts. These logits are aggregated and then
contrastively refined using a noise-only reference input, which suppresses the
leakage and yields more accurate outputs. FOCUS consistently improves
performance across four multi-image benchmarks and diverse LVLM families. This
demonstrates that FOCUS offers a general and practical solution for enhancing
multi-image reasoning without additional training or architectural
modifications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MR6D是一个专为移动机器人设计的6D姿态估计数据集，针对工业环境中大型物体、远距离视角和复杂遮挡等挑战，填补了现有数据集主要关注小型家用物体的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的6D姿态估计数据集主要关注机器人臂操作的小型家用物体，无法满足移动机器人平台在工业环境中面对大型物体、远距离感知、严重自遮挡和多样化相机视角的需求。

Method: 创建了包含92个真实场景、16个独特物体的MR6D数据集，涵盖静态和动态交互场景，捕捉移动平台特有的挑战如远距离视角、多样化物体配置、大尺寸物体和复杂遮挡模式。

Result: 初步实验显示当前6D姿态估计流程在这些设置下表现不佳，2D分割成为另一个主要障碍，表明现有方法难以应对移动机器人环境的特殊挑战。

Conclusion: MR6D为开发和评估针对移动机器人需求的姿态估计方法奠定了基础，填补了该领域的数据空白，数据集已公开可用。

Abstract: Existing 6D pose estimation datasets primarily focus on small household
objects typically handled by robot arm manipulators, limiting their relevance
to mobile robotics. Mobile platforms often operate without manipulators,
interact with larger objects, and face challenges such as long-range
perception, heavy self-occlusion, and diverse camera perspectives. While recent
models generalize well to unseen objects, evaluations remain confined to
household-like settings that overlook these factors. We introduce MR6D, a
dataset designed for 6D pose estimation for mobile robots in industrial
environments. It includes 92 real-world scenes featuring 16 unique objects
across static and dynamic interactions. MR6D captures the challenges specific
to mobile platforms, including distant viewpoints, varied object
configurations, larger object sizes, and complex occlusion/self-occlusion
patterns. Initial experiments reveal that current 6D pipelines underperform in
these settings, with 2D segmentation being another hurdle. MR6D establishes a
foundation for developing and evaluating pose estimation methods tailored to
the demands of mobile robotics. The dataset is available at

<details>

Motivation: 虽然基于单影像的非粗鱷形状注册已经得到广泛研究，但多相机联合使用为医学成像和手持相机注册等应用开启了新方向。多视角信息能提供更高的重建精度。

Method: 提出三种方法：1）关键点位于知道三维点的方向向量上；2）关键点位于未知三维点但方向知道的向量上；3）在对应关系基础上加入边缘信息。前两种采用凸规划求解，第三种采用迭代精炼。

Result: 在各种合成和实际数据上验证了方法的准确性，多视角互相约束显著提升了非粗鱼形状重建的精度。

Conclusion: 这些方法构成了基于普通相机模型的多相机形状从模板恢复问题的首批解决方案，为医学成像和设备注册等领域提供了新的技术支撑。

Abstract: This article presents a new method for non-rigidly registering a 3D shape to
2D keypoints observed by a constellation of multiple cameras. Non-rigid
registration of a 3D shape to observed 2D keypoints, i.e., Shape-from-Template
(SfT), has been widely studied using single images, but SfT with information
from multiple-cameras jointly opens new directions for extending the scope of
known use-cases such as 3D shape registration in medical imaging and
registration from hand-held cameras, to name a few. We represent such
multi-camera setup with the generalised camera model; therefore any collection
of perspective or orthographic cameras observing any deforming object can be
registered. We propose multiple approaches for such SfT: the first approach
where the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from a known 3D
point in space, the second approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a
direction vector from an unknown 3D point in space but with known orientation
w.r.t some local reference frame, and a third approach where, apart from
correspondences, the silhouette of the imaged object is also known. Together,
these form the first set of solutions to the SfT problem with generalised
cameras. The key idea behind SfT with generalised camera is the improved
reconstruction accuracy from estimating deformed shape while utilising the
additional information from the mutual constraints between multiple views of a
deformed object. The correspondence-based approaches are solved with convex
programming while the silhouette-based approach is an iterative refinement of
the results from the convex solutions. We demonstrate the accuracy of our
proposed methods on many synthetic and real data

TL;DR: VisionLaw是一个双层优化框架，从视觉观察中推断可解释的内在动力学表达式，解决了现有方法在泛化性和可解释性方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖手动定义的本构先验难以泛化到复杂场景，要么使用神经网络建模内在动力学导致可解释性差和泛化能力有限。

Method: 采用双层优化框架：上层使用LLM驱动的解耦本构演化策略，将LLM作为物理专家生成和修订本构定律；下层使用视觉引导的本构评估机制，通过视觉模拟评估生成定律与内在动力学的一致性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，VisionLaw能有效从视觉观察中推断可解释的内在动力学，显著优于现有最先进方法，并在新场景的交互模拟中表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: VisionLaw框架成功解决了内在动力学推断中的泛化性和可解释性问题，为物理交互模拟提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The intrinsic dynamics of an object governs its physical behavior in the real
world, playing a critical role in enabling physically plausible interactive
simulation with 3D assets. Existing methods have attempted to infer the
intrinsic dynamics of objects from visual observations, but generally face two
major challenges: one line of work relies on manually defined constitutive
priors, making it difficult to generalize to complex scenarios; the other
models intrinsic dynamics using neural networks, resulting in limited
interpretability and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we
propose VisionLaw, a bilevel optimization framework that infers interpretable
expressions of intrinsic dynamics from visual observations. At the upper level,
we introduce an LLMs-driven decoupled constitutive evolution strategy, where
LLMs are prompted as a knowledgeable physics expert to generate and revise
constitutive laws, with a built-in decoupling mechanism that substantially
reduces the search complexity of LLMs. At the lower level, we introduce a
vision-guided constitutive evaluation mechanism, which utilizes visual
simulation to evaluate the consistency between the generated constitutive law
and the underlying intrinsic dynamics, thereby guiding the upper-level
evolution. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that VisionLaw can effectively infer interpretable intrinsic dynamics from
visual observations. It significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods and exhibits strong generalization for interactive simulation in novel
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高乳腺癌超声分割的准确性和可解释性，通过整合临床文本信息来增强模型的可信度和透明度，为计算机辅助诊断提供更可靠的解决方案。

Method: 使用双分支视觉编码器（ViT+Swin Transformer）和不确定性感知融合，结合BioClinicalBERT编码的BI-RADS语义临床语言，通过跨模态注意力机制融合多模态特征。

Result: 在BUS-BRA数据集上达到Dice 99%和IoU 95%，超越U-Net、ViT和Swin等基线方法；多模态对齐CLIP分数85%，置信度校准ECE 3.2%。

Conclusion: Med-CTX通过整合临床文本显著提升了分割性能和可解释性，为可信赖的多模态医学架构设立了新标准，临床文本对分割准确性和解释质量至关重要。

Abstract: We introduce Med-CTX, a fully transformer based multimodal framework for
explainable breast cancer ultrasound segmentation. We integrate clinical
radiology reports to boost both performance and interpretability. Med-CTX
achieves exact lesion delineation by using a dual-branch visual encoder that
combines ViT and Swin transformers, as well as uncertainty aware fusion.
Clinical language structured with BI-RADS semantics is encoded by
BioClinicalBERT and combined with visual features utilising cross-modal
attention, allowing the model to provide clinically grounded, model generated
explanations. Our methodology generates segmentation masks, uncertainty maps,
and diagnostic rationales all at once, increasing confidence and transparency
in computer assisted diagnosis. On the BUS-BRA dataset, Med-CTX achieves a Dice
score of 99% and an IoU of 95%, beating existing baselines U-Net, ViT, and
Swin. Clinical text plays a key role in segmentation accuracy and explanation
quality, as evidenced by ablation studies that show a -5.4% decline in Dice
score and -31% in CIDEr. Med-CTX achieves good multimodal alignment (CLIP
score: 85%) and increased confi dence calibration (ECE: 3.2%), setting a new
bar for trustworthy, multimodal medical architecture.

Motivation: 城市树木生物多样性对气候适应和生态稳定至关重要，但传统野外调查成本高而监督学习方法需要标签数据且穿越区域性能差。

Method: 提出无监督聚类框架，整合街道级图像的视觉嵌入和空间植装模式，在不需标签数据的情况下估算生物多样性。

Result: 在八个北美城市中，方法高保真度恢复了属级多样性模式，Shannon和Simpson指数的Wasserstein距离低，保持了空间自相关性。

Conclusion: 该可扩展、细粒度方法能够为缺乏详细调查的城市提供生物多样性地图制作，支持低成本连续监测和城市生态系统的适应性管理。

Abstract: Urban tree biodiversity is critical for climate resilience, ecological
stability, and livability in cities, yet most municipalities lack detailed
knowledge of their canopies. Field-based inventories provide reliable estimates
of Shannon and Simpson diversity but are costly and time-consuming, while
supervised AI methods require labeled data that often fail to generalize across
regions. We introduce an unsupervised clustering framework that integrates
visual embeddings from street-level imagery with spatial planting patterns to
estimate biodiversity without labels. Applied to eight North American cities,
the method recovers genus-level diversity patterns with high fidelity,
achieving low Wasserstein distances to ground truth for Shannon and Simpson
indices and preserving spatial autocorrelation. This scalable, fine-grained
approach enables biodiversity mapping in cities lacking detailed inventories
and offers a pathway for continuous, low-cost monitoring to support equitable
access to greenery and adaptive management of urban ecosystems.

Conclusion: SA3方法通过高效的对齐机制和识别策略，有效地解决了跨域对象检测的挑战，为智能交通检测领域提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Achieving top-notch performance in Intelligent Transportation detection is a
critical research area. However, many challenges still need to be addressed
when it comes to detecting in a cross-domain scenario. In this paper, we
propose a Self-Aware Adaptive Alignment (SA3), by leveraging an efficient
alignment mechanism and recognition strategy. Our proposed method employs a
specified attention-based alignment module trained on source and target domain
datasets to guide the image-level features alignment process, enabling the
local-global adaptive alignment between the source domain and target domain.
Features from both domains, whose channel importance is re-weighted, are fed
into the region proposal network, which facilitates the acquisition of salient
region features. Also, we introduce an instance-to-image level alignment module
specific to the target domain to adaptively mitigate the domain gap. To
evaluate the proposed method, extensive experiments have been conducted on
popular cross-domain object detection benchmarks. Experimental results show
that SA3 achieves superior results to the previous state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在视觉效果上表现优异，但经常无法精确对齐提示词，导致缺失关键元素或概念混淆

Method: 学习高成功率分布来条件化目标提示，显式建模去噪过程中的信号组件，提供细粒度控制以减轻过度优化和分布外偏差

Conclusion: 该方法无需训练、可无缝集成到现有扩散和流匹配架构中，为文本到图像生成提供了更准确的控制能力

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models produce visually impressive results but
often struggle with precise alignment to text prompts, leading to missing
critical elements or unintended blending of distinct concepts. We propose a
novel approach that learns a high-success-rate distribution conditioned on a
target prompt, ensuring that generated images faithfully reflect the
corresponding prompts. Our method explicitly models the signal component during
the denoising process, offering fine-grained control that mitigates
over-optimization and out-of-distribution artifacts. Moreover, our framework is
training-free and seamlessly integrates with both existing diffusion and flow
matching architectures. It also supports additional conditioning modalities --
such as bounding boxes -- for enhanced spatial alignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. The

Abstract: The Id-Pattern system within the RED.AI project (Reabilita\c{c}\~ao

assist in the identification of stone deterioration patterns. Traditional
methodologies, based on direct observation by expert teams, are accurate but
costly in terms of time and resources. The system developed here introduces and
evaluates a multi-agent artificial intelligence (AI) system, designed to
simulate collaboration between experts and automate the diagnosis of stone
pathologies from visual evidence. The approach is based on a cognitive
architecture that orchestrates a team of specialized AI agents which, in this
specific case, are limited to five: a lithologist, a pathologist, an
environmental expert, a conservator-restorer, and a diagnostic coordinator. To
evaluate the system we selected 28 difficult images involving multiple
deterioration patterns. Our first results showed a huge boost on all metrics of
our system compared to the foundational model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有增量学习(IL)评估多基于合成的简化指标，影蕴了对IL在现实场景下性能的理解。需要更现实的指标来评估IL方法在应对域假移和类别扩展时的表现。

Method: 建立了两个现实增量学习目标检测基准(RICO)：D-RICO(固定类别集下的域假移)和EC-RICO(每个IL步骤集成新域和新类别)。基准集来自14个多样化数据集，涵盖真实和合成域、不同条件(天气、时间)、相机传感器、视角和标注策略。

Result: 实验结果显示所有IL方法在适应性和知识保持方面都表现不佳。简单地重放少量以前数据已经超过了所有IL方法，但单独训练数据仍然更优。

Conclusion: 当前IL方法在现实场景下存在显著空白，该文价属于教学式中老师能力弱、单一模型无法管理多样任务以及可塑性不足。这些现实指标将为IL领域提供更有意义的评估基准。

Abstract: Incremental Learning (IL) trains models sequentially on new data without full
retraining, offering privacy, efficiency, and scalability. IL must balance
adaptability to new data with retention of old knowledge. However, evaluations
often rely on synthetic, simplified benchmarks, obscuring real-world IL
performance. To address this, we introduce two Realistic Incremental Object
Detection Benchmarks (RICO): Domain RICO (D-RICO) features domain shifts with a
fixed class set, and Expanding-Classes RICO (EC-RICO) integrates new domains
and classes per IL step. Built from 14 diverse datasets covering real and
synthetic domains, varying conditions (e.g., weather, time of day), camera
sensors, perspectives, and labeling policies, both benchmarks capture
challenges absent in existing evaluations. Our experiments show that all IL
methods underperform in adaptability and retention, while replaying a small
amount of previous data already outperforms all methods. However, individual
training on the data remains superior. We heuristically attribute this gap to
weak teachers in distillation, single models' inability to manage diverse
tasks, and insufficient plasticity. Our code will be made publicly available.

Result: 在合成和真实医学任务中验证有效：在玩具数据集上显著提高对注入虚假相关性的鲁棒性；在糖尿病视网膜病变分类任务中，在合成扰动和OOD泛化下均提升性能。

Conclusion: LCRReg提供了一种轻量级、架构无关的策略，无需密集概念监督即可提高模型鲁棒性，优于多任务学习、线性探测和后处理概念模型等基线方法。

Abstract: Deep learning models in medical imaging often achieve strong in-distribution
performance but struggle to generalise under distribution shifts, frequently
relying on spurious correlations instead of clinically meaningful features. We
introduce LCRReg, a novel regularisation approach that leverages Latent Concept
Representations (LCRs) (e.g., Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs)) to guide
models toward semantically grounded representations. LCRReg requires no concept
labels in the main training set and instead uses a small auxiliary dataset to
synthesise high-quality, disentangled concept examples. We extract LCRs for
predefined relevant features, and incorporate a regularisation term that guides
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to activate within latent subspaces
associated with those concepts. We evaluate LCRReg across synthetic and
real-world medical tasks. On a controlled toy dataset, it significantly
improves robustness to injected spurious correlations and remains effective
even in multi-concept and multiclass settings. On the diabetic retinopathy
binary classification task, LCRReg enhances performance under both synthetic
spurious perturbations and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation. Compared
to baselines, including multitask learning, linear probing, and post-hoc
concept-based models, LCRReg offers a lightweight, architecture-agnostic
strategy for improving model robustness without requiring dense concept
supervision. Code is available at the following link:

*Taimur Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文使用ConvLSTM神经网络来预测南亚霜霾事件，通过分析Sentinel-5P数据实现了五天期治氧化指数预测，准确度较高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 南亚霜霾事件对印度-岗子平原造成严重影响，但缺乏区域性实时预测系统。需要开发更有效的污染物浓度预测方法来应对空气质量问题。

Method: 采用卷积长短期记忆神经网络(ConvLSTM)，利用Sentinel-5P卫星2019-2023年的空气成分数据，以紫外线污染物指数(340-380nm)作为预测参数。

Result: 模型在五天期预测中得到平均方差错误约0.0018，损失值约0.3995，结构相似性指数约0.74，显示了良好的预测性能。

Conclusion: ConvLSTM模型能够有效预测南亚霜霾事件，但通过整合更多数据源和精炼网络结构还可以进一步提升预测准确度。

Abstract: The South Asian Smog refers to the recurring annual air pollution events
marked by high contaminant levels, reduced visibility, and significant
socio-economic impacts, primarily affecting the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) from
November to February. Over the past decade, increased air pollution sources
such as crop residue burning, motor vehicles, and changing weather patterns
have intensified these smog events. However, real-time forecasting systems for
increased particulate matter concentrations are still not established at
regional scale. The Aerosol Index, closely tied to smog formation and a key
component in calculating the Air Quality Index (AQI), reflects particulate
matter concentrations. This study forecasts aerosol events using Sentinel-5P
air constituent data (2019-2023) and a Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory
(ConvLSTM) neural network, which captures spatial and temporal correlations
more effectively than previous models. Using the Ultraviolet (UV) Aerosol Index
at 340-380 nm as the predictor, results show the Aerosol Index can be
forecasted at five-day intervals with a Mean Squared Error of ~0.0018, loss of
~0.3995, and Structural Similarity Index of ~0.74. While effective, the model
can be improved by integrating additional data and refining its architecture.

Conclusion: 所提方法通过合理结合卷积操作和注意力机制，有效地解决了长程依赖和局部上下文的共同处理问题，为医学图像分割领域提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical ultrasound image segmentation presents a formidable challenge in the
realm of computer vision. Traditional approaches rely on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based methods to address the intricacies of
medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, inherent limitations persist, as
CNN-based methods tend to disregard long-range dependencies, while
Transformer-based methods may overlook local contextual information. To address
these deficiencies, we propose a novel Feature Aggregation Module (FAM)
designed to process two input features from the preceding layer. These features
are seamlessly directed into two branches of the Convolution and
Cross-Attention Parallel Module (CCAPM) to endow them with different roles in
each of the two branches to help establish a strong connection between the two
input features. This strategy enables our module to focus concurrently on both
long-range dependencies and local contextual information by judiciously merging
convolution operations with cross-attention mechanisms. Moreover, by
integrating FAM within our proposed Spatial-Channel Regulation Module (SCRM),
the ability to discern salient regions and informative features warranting
increased attention is enhanced. Furthermore, by incorporating the SCRM into
the encoder block of the UNet architecture, we introduce a novel framework
dubbed Spatial-Channel Regulation Network (SCRNet). The results of our
extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SCRNet, which consistently
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: PhysGM通过联合预测3D表示和物理属性，结合DPO优化策略，成功解决了现有方法的局限性，为单图像到4D物理仿真提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: While physics-grounded 3D motion synthesis has seen significant progress,
current methods face critical limitations. They typically rely on
pre-reconstructed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations, while physics
integration depends on either inflexible, manually defined physical attributes
or unstable, optimization-heavy guidance from video models. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce PhysGM, a feed-forward framework that jointly predicts
a 3D Gaussian representation and its physical properties from a single image,
enabling immediate, physical simulation and high-fidelity 4D rendering. We
first establish a base model by jointly optimizing for Gaussian reconstruction
and probabilistic physics prediction. The model is then refined with physically
plausible reference videos to enhance both rendering fidelity and physics
prediction accuracy. We adopt the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align
its simulations with reference videos, circumventing Score Distillation
Sampling (SDS) optimization which needs back-propagating gradients through the
complex differentiable simulation and rasterization. To facilitate the
training, we introduce a new dataset PhysAssets of over 24,000 3D assets,
annotated with physical properties and corresponding guiding videos.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively generates
high-fidelity 4D simulations from a single image in one minute. This represents
a significant speedup over prior works while delivering realistic rendering
results. Our project page is at:https://hihixiaolv.github.io/PhysGM.github.io/

TL;DR: DIME-Net是一个双光照增强框架，通过混合专家网络自适应处理低光和背光图像，在单一训练过程中实现多种光照条件下的鲁棒增强。

Conclusion: DIME-Net框架能够有效处理多样化的复杂光照条件，在多媒体应用中具有实际应用潜力，通过单一训练过程实现了对低光和背光图像的统一增强。

Abstract: Image degradation caused by complex lighting conditions such as low-light and
backlit scenarios is commonly encountered in real-world environments,
significantly affecting image quality and downstream vision tasks. Most
existing methods focus on a single type of illumination degradation and lack
the ability to handle diverse lighting conditions in a unified manner. To
address this issue, we propose a dual-illumination enhancement framework called
DIME-Net. The core of our method is a Mixture-of-Experts illumination estimator
module, where a sparse gating mechanism adaptively selects suitable S-curve
expert networks based on the illumination characteristics of the input image.
By integrating Retinex theory, this module effectively performs enhancement
tailored to both low-light and backlit images. To further correct
illumination-induced artifacts and color distortions, we design a damage
restoration module equipped with Illumination-Aware Cross Attention and
Sequential-State Global Attention mechanisms. In addition, we construct a
hybrid illumination dataset, MixBL, by integrating existing datasets, allowing
our model to achieve robust illumination adaptability through a single training
process. Experimental results show that DIME-Net achieves competitive
performance on both synthetic and real-world low-light and backlit datasets
without any retraining. These results demonstrate its generalization ability
and potential for practical multimedia applications under diverse and complex
illumination conditions.

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的基准测试和FR模型上，ViT-FIQA始终达到顶级性能

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的架构在建模面部图像效用方面非常有效，ViT有潜力作为未来FIQA研究的可扩展基础

Abstract: Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) aims to predict the utility of a face
image for face recognition (FR) systems. State-of-the-art FIQA methods mainly
rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leaving the potential of Vision
Transformer (ViT) architectures underexplored. This work proposes ViT-FIQA, a
novel approach that extends standard ViT backbones, originally optimized for
FR, through a learnable quality token designed to predict a scalar utility
score for any given face image. The learnable quality token is concatenated
with the standard image patch tokens, and the whole sequence is processed via
global self-attention by the ViT encoders to aggregate contextual information
across all patches. At the output of the backbone, ViT-FIQA branches into two
heads: (1) the patch tokens are passed through a fully connected layer to learn
discriminative face representations via a margin-penalty softmax loss, and (2)
the quality token is fed into a regression head to learn to predict the face
sample's utility. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks and several
FR models, including both CNN- and ViT-based architectures, demonstrate that
ViT-FIQA consistently achieves top-tier performance. These results underscore
the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures in modeling face image
utility and highlight the potential of ViTs as a scalable foundation for future
FIQA research https://cutt.ly/irHlzXUC.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a fundamental task for 3D scene understanding in
autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Existing depth datasets,
such as KITTI, nuScenes, and DDAD, have advanced the field but suffer from
limitations in diversity and scalability. As benchmark performance on these
datasets approaches saturation, there is an increasing need for a new
generation of large-scale, diverse, and cost-efficient datasets to support the
era of foundation models and multi-modal learning. To address these challenges,
we introduce a large-scale, diverse, frame-wise continuous dataset for depth
estimation in dynamic outdoor driving environments, comprising 20K video frames
to evaluate existing methods. Our lightweight acquisition pipeline ensures
broad scene coverage at low cost, while sparse yet statistically sufficient
ground truth enables robust training. Compared to existing datasets, ours
presents greater diversity in driving scenarios and lower depth density,
creating new challenges for generalization. Benchmark experiments with standard
monocular depth estimation models validate the dataset's utility and highlight
substantial performance gaps in challenging conditions, establishing a new
platform for advancing depth estimation research.

Abstract: Video action detection requires dense spatio-temporal annotations, which are
both challenging and expensive to obtain. However, real-world videos often vary
in difficulty and may not require the same level of annotation. This paper
analyzes the appropriate annotation types for each sample and their impact on
spatio-temporal video action detection. It focuses on two key aspects: 1) how
to obtain varying levels of annotation for videos, and 2) how to learn action
detection from different annotation types. The study explores video-level tags,
points, scribbles, bounding boxes, and pixel-level masks. First, a simple
active learning strategy is proposed to estimate the necessary annotation type
for each video. Then, a novel spatio-temporal 3D-superpixel approach is
introduced to generate pseudo-labels from these annotations, enabling effective
training. The approach is validated on UCF101-24 and JHMDB-21 datasets,
significantly cutting annotation costs with minimal performance loss.

Abstract: Outside of urban hubs, autonomous cars and trucks have to master driving on
intercity highways. Safe, long-distance highway travel at speeds exceeding 100
km/h demands perception distances of at least 250 m, which is about five times
the 50-100m typically addressed in city driving, to allow sufficient planning
and braking margins. Increasing the perception ranges also allows to extend
autonomy from light two-ton passenger vehicles to large-scale forty-ton trucks,
which need a longer planning horizon due to their high inertia. However, most
existing perception approaches focus on shorter ranges and rely on Bird's Eye
View (BEV) representations, which incur quadratic increases in memory and
compute costs as distance grows. To overcome this limitation, we built on top
of a sparse representation and introduced an efficient 3D encoding of
multi-modal and temporal features, along with a novel self-supervised
pre-training scheme that enables large-scale learning from unlabeled
camera-LiDAR data. Our approach extends perception distances to 250 meters and
achieves an 26.6% improvement in mAP in object detection and a decrease of
30.5% in Chamfer Distance in LiDAR forecasting compared to existing methods,
reaching distances up to 250 meters. Project Page:

Conclusion: 通过适应性视角选择和多视角一致性保证，成功实现了高质量的在线3D高斯涂射模型生成，有效提升了场景重建的完整性

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of generating online 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) models from RGB-only frames. Previous studies have employed dense SLAM
techniques to estimate 3D scenes from keyframes for 3DGS model construction.
However, these methods are limited by their reliance solely on keyframes, which
are insufficient to capture an entire scene, resulting in incomplete
reconstructions. Moreover, building a generalizable model requires
incorporating frames from diverse viewpoints to achieve broader scene coverage.
However, online processing restricts the use of many frames or extensive
training iterations. Therefore, we propose a novel method for high-quality 3DGS
modeling that improves model completeness through adaptive view selection. By
analyzing reconstruction quality online, our approach selects optimal
non-keyframes for additional training. By integrating both keyframes and
selected non-keyframes, the method refines incomplete regions from diverse
viewpoints, significantly enhancing completeness. We also present a framework
that incorporates an online multi-view stereo approach, ensuring consistency in
3D information throughout the 3DGS modeling process. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering
exceptional performance in complex outdoor scenes.

Conclusion: 该方法简单而有效，通过显式抑制噪声成分和优化图像布局，显著提升了数据投毒后门攻击的效果，为对比学习的安全性研究提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) effectively learns transferable
representations from unlabeled data containing images or image-text pairs but
suffers vulnerability to data poisoning backdoor attacks (DPCLs). An adversary
can inject poisoned images into pretraining datasets, causing compromised CL
encoders to exhibit targeted misbehavior in downstream tasks. Existing DPCLs,
however, achieve limited efficacy due to their dependence on fragile implicit
co-occurrence between backdoor and target object and inadequate suppression of
discriminative features in backdoored images. We propose Noisy Alignment (NA),
a DPCL method that explicitly suppresses noise components in poisoned images.
Inspired by powerful training-controllable CL attacks, we identify and extract
the critical objective of noisy alignment, adapting it effectively into
data-poisoning scenarios. Our method implements noisy alignment by
strategically manipulating contrastive learning's random cropping mechanism,
formulating this process as an image layout optimization problem with
theoretically derived optimal parameters. The resulting method is simple yet
effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to existing DPCLs,
while maintaining clean-data accuracy. Furthermore, Noisy Alignment
demonstrates robustness against common backdoor defenses. Codes can be found at

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video AIGC have ushered in a transformative era for
audio-driven human animation. However, conventional video dubbing techniques
remain constrained to mouth region editing, resulting in discordant facial
expressions and body gestures that compromise viewer immersion. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce sparse-frame video dubbing, a novel paradigm that
strategically preserves reference keyframes to maintain identity, iconic
gestures, and camera trajectories while enabling holistic, audio-synchronized
full-body motion editing. Through critical analysis, we identify why naive
image-to-video models fail in this task, particularly their inability to
achieve adaptive conditioning. Addressing this, we propose InfiniteTalk, a
streaming audio-driven generator designed for infinite-length long sequence
dubbing. This architecture leverages temporal context frames for seamless
inter-chunk transitions and incorporates a simple yet effective sampling
strategy that optimizes control strength via fine-grained reference frame
positioning. Comprehensive evaluations on HDTF, CelebV-HQ, and EMTD datasets
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Quantitative metrics confirm superior
visual realism, emotional coherence, and full-body motion synchronization.

TL;DR: DetailGen3D是一个专门用于增强生成3D形状几何细节的生成方法，通过潜在空间中的数据依赖流实现从粗糙到精细的转换，避免了大尺度3D生成模型的计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代3D生成方法虽然能够从稀疏或单视图快速创建形状，但由于计算限制，其输出往往缺乏几何细节。

Method: 采用数据依赖流在潜在空间建模粗糙到精细的转换，引入token匹配策略确保细化过程中的准确空间对应，通过精心设计的训练数据匹配合成粗糙形状的特征。

Result: 能够有效增强各种3D生成和重建方法产生的形状，从单视图到稀疏多视图输入，实现了高保真几何细节合成。

Conclusion: DetailGen3D在保持训练效率的同时，实现了高质量的几何细节增强，适用于多种3D生成场景。

Abstract: Modern 3D generation methods can rapidly create shapes from sparse or single
views, but their outputs often lack geometric detail due to computational
constraints. We present DetailGen3D, a generative approach specifically
designed to enhance these generated 3D shapes. Our key insight is to model the
coarse-to-fine transformation directly through data-dependent flows in latent
space, avoiding the computational overhead of large-scale 3D generative models.
We introduce a token matching strategy that ensures accurate spatial
correspondence during refinement, enabling local detail synthesis while
preserving global structure. By carefully designing our training data to match
the characteristics of synthesized coarse shapes, our method can effectively
enhance shapes produced by various 3D generation and reconstruction approaches,
from single-view to sparse multi-view inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DetailGen3D achieves high-fidelity geometric detail synthesis while
maintaining efficiency in training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting虽然在新视角合成上表现突出，但需要大量3D高斯分布导致内存和存储成本过高，影响实际应用

Method: 提出知识蓄粉框架，使用普通3DGS、噪声增强版和dropout正则化版本等多种老师模型，通过结构相似性损失促进学生模型与老师模型的空间几何分布一致性

Result: 在多个数据集上进行了全面的定量和定性评估，Distilled-3DGS框架在渲染质量和存储效率方面都达到了与最先进方法可比的结果

Conclusion: 该简单有效的知识蓄粉框架成功解决了3DGS的内存存储问题，在保持高保真渲染的同时大幅降低了资源需求

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has exhibited remarkable efficacy in novel view
synthesis (NVS). However, it suffers from a significant drawback: achieving
high-fidelity rendering typically necessitates a large number of 3D Gaussians,
resulting in substantial memory consumption and storage requirements. To
address this challenge, we propose the first knowledge distillation framework
for 3DGS, featuring various teacher models, including vanilla 3DGS,
noise-augmented variants, and dropout-regularized versions. The outputs of
these teachers are aggregated to guide the optimization of a lightweight
student model. To distill the hidden geometric structure, we propose a
structural similarity loss to boost the consistency of spatial geometric
distributions between the student and teacher model. Through comprehensive
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across diverse datasets, the proposed
Distilled-3DGS, a simple yet effective framework without bells and whistles,
achieves promising rendering results in both rendering quality and storage
efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods. Project page:

Motivation: 解决组合视频检索中细粒度查询和时间理解的复杂性问题，标准检索框架在这些场景下表现有限。

Method: 构建包含160万样本的素度数据集，开发使用基础文本编码器通过交叉注意力融合视觉和文本信息的模型。

Result: 在视觉+文本设置下达到71.3% Recall@1，比现有最佳方法提升3.4%，在所有指标上都达到了状态前沿。

Conclusion: 该研究为细粒度组合视频检索提供了有效的数据集和模型方案，显著提升了对细致视频描述和素度修改文本的利用能力。

Abstract: Composed video retrieval is a challenging task that strives to retrieve a
target video based on a query video and a textual description detailing
specific modifications. Standard retrieval frameworks typically struggle to
handle the complexity of fine-grained compositional queries and variations in
temporal understanding limiting their retrieval ability in the fine-grained
setting. To address this issue, we introduce a novel dataset that captures both
fine-grained and composed actions across diverse video segments, enabling more
detailed compositional changes in retrieved video content. The proposed
dataset, named Dense-WebVid-CoVR, consists of 1.6 million samples with dense
modification text that is around seven times more than its existing
counterpart. We further develop a new model that integrates visual and textual
information through Cross-Attention (CA) fusion using grounded text encoder,
enabling precise alignment between dense query modifications and target videos.
The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results surpassing existing
methods on all metrics. Notably, it achieves 71.3\% Recall@1 in visual+text
setting and outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3.4\%, highlighting its
efficacy in terms of leveraging detailed video descriptions and dense
modification texts. Our proposed dataset, code, and model are available at

Abstract: LongSplat addresses critical challenges in novel view synthesis (NVS) from
casually captured long videos characterized by irregular camera motion, unknown
camera poses, and expansive scenes. Current methods often suffer from pose
drift, inaccurate geometry initialization, and severe memory limitations. To
address these issues, we introduce LongSplat, a robust unposed 3D Gaussian
Splatting framework featuring: (1) Incremental Joint Optimization that
concurrently optimizes camera poses and 3D Gaussians to avoid local minima and
ensure global consistency; (2) a robust Pose Estimation Module leveraging
learned 3D priors; and (3) an efficient Octree Anchor Formation mechanism that
converts dense point clouds into anchors based on spatial density. Extensive

Motivation: 大语言模型输出常反映训练数据中的结构性性别不平衡问题，需要方法来检测和减少这种偏见。

Method: 建立在话语感知公平性分析的基础上，提出新的演员级指标，包括情感不对称性、句法主体性和引用风格。支持诊断性语料分析和排除基于平衡的方法。

Result: 在taz2024full德国报纸语料库(1980-2024)中应用，在多个语言维度上显示出性别平衡的显著改善。表面层面的不对称性可通过筛选和重新平衡来减缓，但情感和框架方面的更细微偏见仍持续存在。

Conclusion: 该流水线能够有效检测和减少文本语料库中的性别歧视，将工具和报告开放以支持更进一步的话语基于公平性审计和公平语料库构建研究。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly shaping digital communication, yet
their outputs often reflect structural gender imbalances that originate from
their training data. This paper presents an extended actor-level pipeline for
detecting and mitigating gender discrimination in large-scale text corpora.
Building on prior work in discourse-aware fairness analysis, we introduce new
actor-level metrics that capture asymmetries in sentiment, syntactic agency,
and quotation styles. The pipeline supports both diagnostic corpus analysis and
exclusion-based balancing, enabling the construction of fairer corpora. We
apply our approach to the taz2024full corpus of German newspaper articles from
1980 to 2024, demonstrating substantial improvements in gender balance across
multiple linguistic dimensions. Our results show that while surface-level
asymmetries can be mitigated through filtering and rebalancing, subtler forms
of bias persist, particularly in sentiment and framing. We release the tools
and reports to support further research in discourse-based fairness auditing
and equitable corpus construction.

Result: 当前最好的OpenAI o3模型仅获29.02%的准确率，显示现有模型在多模态能力上仍有明显短板

Conclusion: MM-BrowseComp揭示了当前AI模型在多模态检索和推理方面的不足，为多模态浏览能力的评估和改进提供了重要基准

Abstract: AI agents with advanced reasoning and tool use capabilities have demonstrated
impressive performance in web browsing for deep search. While existing
benchmarks such as BrowseComp evaluate these browsing abilities, they primarily
focus on textual information, overlooking the prevalence of multimodal content.
To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-BrowseComp, a novel benchmark comprising
224 challenging, hand-crafted questions specifically designed to assess agents'
multimodal retrieval and reasoning capabilities. These questions often
incorporate images in prompts, and crucial information encountered during the
search and reasoning process may also be embedded within images or videos on
webpages. Consequently, methods relying solely on text prove insufficient for
our benchmark. Additionally, we provide a verified checklist for each question,
enabling fine-grained analysis of multimodal dependencies and reasoning paths.
Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models on MM-BrowseComp
reveals that even top models like OpenAI o3 with tools achieve only 29.02\%
accuracy, highlighting the suboptimal multimodal capabilities and lack of
native multimodal reasoning in current models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然基于RNN-T的ASR系统能够实时转写，但实现流式实时翻译仍面临重大挑战，需要在翻译质量和延迟之间取得平衡。

Method: 利用ASR系统生成的语言线索来管理上下文，采用高效的检索剪枝技术（如超时和强制终止）来维持系统的实时性能。

Result: 在设备上的双语对话语音翻译中，该方法在延迟和质量方面都超过了基线系统，缩小了与非流式翻译系统的质量差距。

Conclusion: 该研究为更准确和高效的实时语音翻译开际了新路径，通过有效的ASR-MT集成和延迟控制技术实现了性能提升。

Abstract: This paper tackles several challenges that arise when integrating Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) and Machine Translation (MT) for real-time, on-device
streaming speech translation. Although state-of-the-art ASR systems based on
Recurrent Neural Network Transducers (RNN-T) can perform real-time
transcription, achieving streaming translation in real-time remains a
significant challenge. To address this issue, we propose a simultaneous
translation approach that effectively balances translation quality and latency.
We also investigate efficient integration of ASR and MT, leveraging linguistic
cues generated by the ASR system to manage context and utilizing efficient
beam-search pruning techniques such as time-out and forced finalization to
maintain system's real-time factor. We apply our approach to an on-device
bilingual conversational speech translation and demonstrate that our techniques
outperform baselines in terms of latency and quality. Notably, our technique
narrows the quality gap with non-streaming translation systems, paving the way
for more accurate and efficient real-time speech translation.

TL;DR: 本文研究了推理能力对大型语言模型在习语检测任务中的影响，发现推理效果比预期小且多变，大模型表现更好但小模型通过提供定义提示可改善性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索推理能力如何影响LLMs在习语检测任务中的表现，以及模型规模对性能的影响，因为习语理解需要先理解再推理的认知过程。

Method: 使用DeepSeek-R1蒸馏模型系列（1.5B到70B参数）在四个习语检测数据集上进行评估，分析链式思维推理的效果，并对小模型提供定义提示进行实验。

Result: 推理效果比预期小且多变：小模型通过CoT推理可从数学调优模型提升性能但不及基础模型；大模型（14B+）显示适度改进；大模型能准确理解习语含义而小模型常失败；为小模型提供定义提示可在某些情况下改善性能。

Conclusion: 模型规模对习语检测性能有重要影响，大模型展现出更好的习语理解能力，而小模型需要外部知识辅助才能达到更好性能，推理能力的作用相对有限且因模型规模而异。

Abstract: The recent trend towards utilisation of reasoning models has improved the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across many tasks which involve
logical steps. One linguistic task that could benefit from this framing is
idiomaticity detection, as a potentially idiomatic expression must first be
understood before it can be disambiguated and serves as a basis for reasoning.
In this paper, we explore how reasoning capabilities in LLMs affect
idiomaticity detection performance and examine the effect of model size. We
evaluate, as open source representative models, the suite of DeepSeek-R1
distillation models ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters across four
idiomaticity detection datasets. We find the effect of reasoning to be smaller
and more varied than expected. For smaller models, producing chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning increases performance from Math-tuned intermediate models, but
not to the levels of the base models, whereas larger models (14B, 32B, and 70B)
show modest improvements. Our in-depth analyses reveal that larger models
demonstrate good understanding of idiomaticity, successfully producing accurate
definitions of expressions, while smaller models often fail to output the
actual meaning. For this reason, we also experiment with providing definitions
in the prompts of smaller models, which we show can improve performance in some
cases.

Motivation: ASR系统在长音频转录中维持语法和语义准确性面临挑战，影响命名实体识别等任务的性能。

Method: 使用两种策略：(1)标记级利洗结合最优运输对齐维度和序列长度；(2)最小化Whisper和LLaMA句子嵌入表征之间的表征损失，混合语法和语义。

Result: 在Spoken Wikipedia数据集上评估显示，在WER、NER、大写化和标点符号成功率方面取得显著改善。

Conclusion: 通过引入新的NER指标和探索语义感知ASR，该工作强调了将语言上下文集成到转录中的价值，为长形式语音中健壮的上下文感知ASR奠定了基础。

Abstract: ASR systems often struggle with maintaining syntactic and semantic accuracy
in long audio transcripts, impacting tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER),
capitalization, and punctuation. We propose a novel approach that enhances ASR
by distilling contextual knowledge from LLaMA models into Whisper. Our method
uses two strategies: (1) token level distillation with optimal transport to
align dimensions and sequence lengths, and (2) representation loss minimization
between sentence embeddings of Whisper and LLaMA, blending syntax and
semantics. Evaluations on the Spoken Wikipedia dataset, a benchmark with long
audios and rich entities demonstrate significant improvements in Word Error
Rate (WER), NER, capitalization, and punctuation success. By introducing novel
NER metrics and exploring semantics aware ASR, our work highlights the value of
integrating linguistic context into transcription, setting a foundation for
robust, context-aware ASR in longform speech.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前LLM在推理过程中常见的格式崩溃、冗长循环和工具调用不可靠等问题，提供更高效、可靠的数据分析和复杂问题求解能力。

Method: 1) 轨迹中心合成数据生成器产生144,000个标记笔记本片段；2) 双奖励框架结合轻量级结构信号和分层奖励模型；3) 内存优化的GRPO实现，包含KV缓存重用和顺序生成；4) 余弦课程从结构保真度平滑过渡到语义深度。

Result: 在AIME 2024/2025和LiveCodeBench等基准测试中准确率提升30%，token使用减少18-49%，达到甚至超越QwQ-32B等更大推理模型的水平。

Conclusion: Datarus通过轨迹式训练和双推理接口设计，成功解决了RL对齐LLM的常见问题，在保持高效推理的同时显著提升了复杂问题求解的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: We present Datarus-R1-14B, a 14 B-parameter open-weights language model
fine-tuned from Qwen 2.5-14B-Instruct to act as a virtual data analyst and
graduate-level problem solver. Datarus is trained not on isolated
question-answer pairs but on full analytical trajectories including reasoning
steps, code execution, error traces, self-corrections, and final conclusions,
all captured in a ReAct-style notebook format spanning finance, medicine,
numerical analysis, and other quantitative domains. Our training pipeline
combines (i) a trajectory-centric synthetic data generator that yielded 144 000
tagged notebook episodes, (ii) a dual-reward framework blending a lightweight
tag-based structural signal with a Hierarchical Reward Model (HRM) that scores
both single-step soundness and end-to-end coherence, and (iii) a
memory-optimized implementation of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
featuring KV-cache reuse, sequential generation, and reference-model sharding.
A cosine curriculum smoothly shifts emphasis from structural fidelity to
semantic depth, reducing the format collapse and verbosity that often plague
RL-aligned LLMs. A central design choice in Datarus is it dual reasoning
interface. In agentic mode the model produces ReAct-tagged steps that invoke
Python tools to execute real code; in reflection mode it outputs compact
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces delimited by <think> and <answer> tags. On
demanding postgraduate-level problems, Datarus exhibits an "AHA-moment"
pattern: it sketches hypotheses, revises them once or twice, and converges
avoiding the circular, token-inflating loops common to contemporary systems.
Across standard public benchmarks Datarus surpasses similar size models and
even reaches the level of larger reasoning models such as QwQ-32B achieving up
to 30% higher accuracy on AIME 2024/2025 and LiveCodeBench while emitting
18-49% fewer tokens per solution.

Motivation: 大语言模型在跨文化沟通中表现出训练语料库的语言和观点分布偏差，但由于文化知识有限和缺乏有效学习方法，文化对齐仍然是一个挑战。

Method: 使用Small-World-of-Words项目的英语-美国和普通话词汇联想数据，通过监督微调(SFT)和PPO偏好优化对Llama-3.1-8B和Qwen-2.5-7B进行参数高效微调。

Result: SFT将英语的P@5提升16-20%，普通话提升43-165%，中位具体性提升+0.20，达到人类水平的情感效价和唤醒度。在世界价值观调查中，微调模型将回答分布向目标文化偏移，在50项高张力问题上，Qwen的中文对齐回答翻倍，Llama的美国偏见下降三分之一。7-8B模型性能媲美甚至超过70B基线模型。

Conclusion: 几百万个基于文化的词汇联想可以在不进行昂贵重新训练的情况下实现价值对齐，强调了基于人类认知的未来研究在改善AI模型文化对齐方面的潜力和必要性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate cross-cultural
communication, their behavior still reflects the distributional bias of the
languages and viewpoints that are over-represented in their pre-training
corpora. Yet, it remains a challenge to model and align culture due to limited
cultural knowledge and a lack of exploration into effective learning
approaches. We introduce a cost-efficient, cognitively grounded remedy:
parameter-efficient fine-tuning on native speakers' free word-association
norms, which encode implicit cultural schemas. Leveraging English-US and
Mandarin associations from the Small-World-of-Words project, we adapt
Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and PPO-based
preference optimization. SFT boosts held-out association Precision at 5 by
16-20% in English and 43-165% in Mandarin, lifts median concreteness by +0.20,
and attains human-level valence and arousal. These lexical gains transfer: on
World-Values-Survey questions, fine-tuned models shift answer distributions
toward the target culture, and on a 50-item high-tension subset, Qwen's
Chinese-aligned responses double while Llama's US bias drops by one-third. Our
7-8B models rival or beat vanilla 70B baselines, showing that a few million
culture-grounded associations can instill value alignment without costly
retraining. Our work highlights both the promise and the need for future
research grounded in human cognition in improving cultural alignment in AI
models.

Motivation: 当前医疗大语言模型主要在被动回答模式下工作，缺乏主动提问获取关键信息的能力，这在真实临床交互场景中存在误诊风险

Method: 提出基于强化学习的ProMed框架，核心是Shapley信息增益(SIG)奖励机制，结合两阶段训练：SIG引导的模型初始化和SIG增强的策略优化

Result: 在两个新构建的部分信息医疗基准测试中，ProMed平均优于最先进方法6.29%，相比被动范式提升54.45%，且在域外案例中表现稳健

Conclusion: ProMed成功将医疗LLM转变为主动提问范式，通过量化临床问题价值的信息增益奖励机制，显著提升了医疗交互诊断的准确性和可靠性

Abstract: Interactive medical questioning is essential in real-world clinical
consultations, where physicians must actively gather information from patients.
While medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
in static medical question answering, they predominantly operate under a
reactive paradigm: generating answers directly without seeking additional
information, which risks incorrect diagnoses in such interactive settings. To
address this limitation, we propose ProMed, a reinforcement learning (RL)
framework that transitions medical LLMs toward a proactive paradigm, equipping
them with the ability to ask clinically valuable questions before
decision-making. At the core of ProMed is the Shapley Information Gain (SIG)
reward, which quantifies the clinical utility of each question by combining the
amount of newly acquired information with its contextual importance, estimated
via Shapley values. We integrate SIG into a two-stage training pipeline: (1)
SIG-Guided Model Initialization uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to
construct high-reward interaction trajectories to supervise the model, and (2)
SIG-Augmented Policy Optimization, which integrates SIG and enhances RL with a
novel SIG-guided Reward Distribution Mechanism that assigns higher rewards to
informative questions for targeted optimization. Extensive experiments on two
newly curated partial-information medical benchmarks demonstrate that ProMed
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.29% and
delivers a 54.45% gain over the reactive paradigm, while also generalizing
robustly to out-of-domain cases.

dialectal variation. Using a privately curated Saudi Dialect Instruction
dataset (Hijazi and Najdi; 5,466 synthetic instruction-response pairs; 50/50
split), we LoRA-tune ALLaM-7B-Instruct-preview, the first foundation model
developed in Saudi Arabia, for Saudi dialect generation. We investigate two
variants: (i) Dialect-Token training, which prepends an explicit dialect tag to
the instruction, and (ii) No-Token training, which omits the tag at formatting
time. Evaluation on a held-out test set combines an external dialect classifier
with text fidelity metrics (chrF++ and BERTScore) and diversity measures. The
Dialect-Token model achieves the best control, raising the Saudi rate from
47.97% to 84.21% and reducing MSA leakage from 32.63% to 6.21%; fidelity also
improves (chrF++ +3.53, BERTScore +0.059). Both LoRA variants outperform strong
generic instruction models (Falcon-7B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct,
Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct, AceGPT-v2-8B-Chat, JAIS-13B-Chat) in dialect control and
fidelity, while avoiding metadata-tag echoing that these baselines frequently
exhibit. We do not release the dataset or any model weights/adapters; instead,
we release training/evaluation/inference code and a detailed datasheet (schema
and aggregate statistics) to support independent verification.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了MATA数据集，用于评估大语言模型在泰卢固语中的表现，包含729道多选题和开放式问题，并对11个模型进行了细粒度分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了评估大语言模型在低资源语言（泰卢固语）中的能力，以及分析模型依赖的表面假设和判断机制的可靠性。

Method: 构建了包含729道多选题和开放式问题的MATA数据集，涉及多种语言维度。对11个开源和闭源LLM进行评测，分析模型在多选题中对答案位置和干扰项模式的依赖，并比较LLM作为判官与人类评估的差异。

Result: 实验显示LLM在多选题中依赖表面假设（如答案位置和干扰项模式），并在低资源语言中使用LLM作为判官的可靠性有限。

Conclusion: 细粒度评估对理解模型限制和发展更强语言能力的LLM至关重要，MATA数据集为泰卢固语NLP研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MATA, a novel evaluation dataset to assess the
ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Telugu language, comprising 729
carefully curated multiple-choice and open-ended questions that span diverse
linguistic dimensions. We evaluate 11 open-weight and closed-source LLMs on our
dataset and present a fine-grained analysis of their performance. Further, we
empirically show how LLMs rely on superficial heuristics such as answer
position and distractor patterns for multiple-choice questions. Finally, we
also compare LLM-as-a-judge evaluation with human evaluation for open-ended
questions and draw some conclusions on its reliability in a low-resource
language. We argue that such fine-grained evaluation is essential for
understanding model limitations and can inform the development of more
linguistically capable LLMs, while also serving as a foundation for future
research in Telugu NLP.

### [94] [Compressed Models are NOT Trust-equivalent to Their Large Counterparts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13533)
*Rohit Raj Rai,Chirag Kothari,Siddhesh Shelke,Amit Awekar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个两维度的信任等效性评估框架，通过解释性对齐和检验相似性来评估压缩模型是否可信任，发现压缩模型尽管准确率相似但在信任度上与原始模型存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然现有研究已经深入研究了压缩对模型准确率的影响，但性能平等并不保证信任等效性。需要一个更全面的框架来评估压缩模型是否可以像原始大模型一样可信任。

Method: 提出两维度评估框架：1）解释性对齐：使用LIME和SHAP测试来量化模型是否基于相同的输入特征做出预测；2）检验相似性：通过ECE、MCE、Brier Score和可靠性图来评估模型预测概率的可靠性。实验使用BERT-base模型和其多个压缩变体，重点关注自然语言推理和参考识别任务。

Result: 实验结果显示，压缩模型在解释性对齐上较低，检验相似性上存在显著不匹配。这种情况甚至在模型准确率几乎相同时也会出现，说明压缩模型并不与原始大模型信任等效。

Conclusion: 压缩模型作为大模型的直接替代品部署时，需要进行谨慎的评估，超越仅仅考虑性能平等性。这项研究强调了信任等效性评估的重要性，为模型压缩的安全部署提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large Deep Learning models are often compressed before being deployed in a
resource-constrained environment. Can we trust the prediction of compressed
models just as we trust the prediction of the original large model? Existing
work has keenly studied the effect of compression on accuracy and related
performance measures. However, performance parity does not guarantee
trust-equivalence. We propose a two-dimensional framework for trust-equivalence
evaluation. First, interpretability alignment measures whether the models base
their predictions on the same input features. We use LIME and SHAP tests to
measure the interpretability alignment. Second, calibration similarity measures
whether the models exhibit comparable reliability in their predicted
probabilities. It is assessed via ECE, MCE, Brier Score, and reliability
diagrams. We conducted experiments using BERT-base as the large model and its
multiple compressed variants. We focused on two text classification tasks:
natural language inference and paraphrase identification. Our results reveal
low interpretability alignment and significant mismatch in calibration
similarity. It happens even when the accuracies are nearly identical between
models. These findings show that compressed models are not trust-equivalent to
their large counterparts. Deploying compressed models as a drop-in replacement
for large models requires careful assessment, going beyond performance parity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 在医疗领域LLM应用中，确定性解码策略（如beam search）通常优于随机策略，模型大小影响性能但解码策略选择有时比模型选择更重要，医疗专用LLM并未显示出整体优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域对文本生成的准确性要求极高，但解码策略对医疗LLM输出质量的影响尚未得到充分研究，需要系统评估不同解码策略在医疗任务中的表现。

Method: 在五个开放式医疗任务（翻译、摘要、问答、对话和图像描述）中评估11种解码策略，使用医疗专用和通用LLM不同规模的模型，比较多种评估指标。

Result: beam search表现最佳，随机采样策略最差；大模型性能更好但推理时间更长；医疗LLM仅在两个任务中优于通用模型，且对解码策略更敏感；不同评估指标相关性因任务而异。

Conclusion: 医疗应用中需要谨慎选择解码方法，其影响有时甚至超过模型选择本身，确定性策略通常更可靠，评估指标选择也需根据具体任务而定。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on various decoding strategies to generate
text, and these choices can significantly affect output quality. In healthcare,
where accuracy is critical, the impact of decoding strategies remains
underexplored. We investigate this effect in five open-ended medical tasks,
including translation, summarization, question answering, dialogue, and image
captioning, evaluating 11 decoding strategies with medically specialized and
general-purpose LLMs of different sizes. Our results show that deterministic
strategies generally outperform stochastic ones: beam search achieves the
highest scores, while {\eta} and top-k sampling perform worst. Slower decoding
methods tend to yield better quality. Larger models achieve higher scores
overall but have longer inference times and are no more robust to decoding.
Surprisingly, while medical LLMs outperform general ones in two of the five
tasks, statistical analysis shows no overall performance advantage and reveals
greater sensitivity to decoding choice. We further compare multiple evaluation
metrics and find that correlations vary by task, with MAUVE showing weak
agreement with BERTScore and ROUGE, as well as greater sensitivity to the
decoding strategy. These results highlight the need for careful selection of
decoding methods in medical applications, as their influence can sometimes
exceed that of model choice.

TL;DR: 语音LLM如Bark在说话者选择上显示出某些性别倾向，但没有系统性偏见，通过职业和性别色彩词汇数据集进行分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语音LLM是否像文本LLM一样存在性别偏见，利用说话者赋予作为分析工具来调查模型的性别偏向。

Method: 构建两个数据集：职业数据集（包含性别刻板印职业）和性别色彩词汇数据集，分析Bark TTS模型的默认说话者赋予情况。

Result: Bark模型展现出性别意识和某些性别倾向，但没有发现系统性的性别偏见模式。

Conclusion: 语音LLM在说话者选择方面显示出与文本LLM不同的性别表现特征，虽有性别倾向但无系统偏见，这为语音AI的性别偏见研究提供了新的分析视角。

Abstract: Similar to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), Speech-LLMs exhibit
emergent abilities and context awareness. However, whether these similarities
extend to gender bias remains an open question. This study proposes a
methodology leveraging speaker assignment as an analytic tool for bias
investigation. Unlike text-based models, which encode gendered associations
implicitly, Speech-LLMs must produce a gendered voice, making speaker selection
an explicit bias cue. We evaluate Bark, a Text-to-Speech (TTS) model, analyzing
its default speaker assignments for textual prompts. If Bark's speaker
selection systematically aligns with gendered associations, it may reveal
patterns in its training data or model design. To test this, we construct two
datasets: (i) Professions, containing gender-stereotyped occupations, and (ii)
Gender-Colored Words, featuring gendered connotations. While Bark does not
exhibit systematic bias, it demonstrates gender awareness and has some gender
inclinations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CRISP是一种基于稀疏自编码器的参数高效方法，用于实现持久性的概念遗忘，通过自动识别并抑制多个层中的关键特征来移除有害知识，同时保持模型的其他能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在现实应用中的部署增加，需要选择性移除不良知识同时保持模型效用的需求变得至关重要。现有的稀疏自编码器方法大多在推理时操作，无法实现参数层面的持久改变，容易被恶意行为者绕过。

Method: CRISP使用稀疏自编码器自动识别多个层中的显著特征，并抑制这些特征的激活。该方法在参数层面进行持久性修改，确保概念遗忘的持久性。

Result: 在两个大语言模型上的实验表明，CRISP在WMDP基准测试的安全关键遗忘任务上优于先前方法，成功移除有害知识的同时保持通用和领域内能力。特征级分析显示CRISP实现了目标概念与良性概念的语义分离。

Conclusion: CRISP提供了一种有效的参数级概念遗忘方法，能够精确抑制目标特征，实现安全可靠的模型知识管理。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, the need to selectively remove unwanted knowledge while
preserving model utility has become paramount. Recent work has explored sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to perform precise interventions on monosemantic features.
However, most SAE-based methods operate at inference time, which does not
create persistent changes in the model's parameters. Such interventions can be
bypassed or reversed by malicious actors with parameter access. We introduce
CRISP, a parameter-efficient method for persistent concept unlearning using
SAEs. CRISP automatically identifies salient SAE features across multiple
layers and suppresses their activations. We experiment with two LLMs and show
that our method outperforms prior approaches on safety-critical unlearning
tasks from the WMDP benchmark, successfully removing harmful knowledge while
preserving general and in-domain capabilities. Feature-level analysis reveals
that CRISP achieves semantically coherent separation between target and benign
concepts, allowing precise suppression of the target features.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了视觉语言模型在越南语多模态教育评估中的表现，发现当前最先进模型仅达到57.74%的准确率，远低于人类平均水平（66.54%），只有o3思维模型（74.07%）超过人类平均但远低于人类最佳表现（99.60%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索主要基于英语数据训练的视觉语言模型是否能处理真实世界的跨语言多模态推理任务，特别是在低资源语言越南语的教育评估场景中。

Method: 提出了ViExam基准测试，包含2,548个多模态问题，涵盖7个学术领域（数学、物理、化学、生物、地理、驾驶测试和智商测试），评估了最先进和开源VLM模型的表现，并测试了跨语言提示和人类协作策略。

Result: SOTA VLMs平均准确率57.74%，开源模型27.70%；跨语言提示反而降低性能1个百分点；人类协作可提升5个百分点；只有o3思维模型（74.07%）超过人类平均表现。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在越南语多模态教育评估中表现不佳，跨语言迁移能力有限，需要针对低资源语言开发专门的训练方法和评估基准。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on English
multimodal tasks, but their performance on low-resource languages with
genuinely multimodal educational content remains largely unexplored. In this
work, we test how VLMs perform on Vietnamese educational assessments,
investigating whether VLMs trained predominantly on English data can handle
real-world cross-lingual multimodal reasoning. Our work presents the first
comprehensive evaluation of VLM capabilities on multimodal Vietnamese exams
through proposing ViExam, a benchmark containing 2,548 multimodal questions. We
find that state-of-the-art VLMs achieve only 57.74% while open-source models
achieve 27.70% mean accuracy across 7 academic domains, including Mathematics,
Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography, Driving Test, and IQ Test. Most VLMs
underperform average human test-takers (66.54%), with only the thinking VLM o3
(74.07%) exceeding human average performance, yet still falling substantially
short of human best performance (99.60%). Cross-lingual prompting with English
instructions while maintaining Vietnamese content fails to improve performance,
decreasing accuracy by 1 percentage point for SOTA VLMs. Human-in-the-loop
collaboration can partially improve VLM performance by 5 percentage points.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文评估了28个大语言模型在包含通用泛化的置信推理模式上的表现，发现前沿模型在默认推理方面有一定能力，但性能差异较大，并且CoT提示经常导致性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用泛化（如'鸟会飞'）在语言学、哲学、逻辑学和认知科学中具有重要地位，因其复杂的例外允许特性和在默认推理、认知及概念获取中的核心作用。研究者想了解LLM在这些关键推理模式上的能力。

Method: 使用20种置信推理模式评估28个大语言模型的表现，测试了不同提示风格（零梳提示、少梳提示、链式思维提示）对模型性能的影响。

Result: 前沿模型在默认推理问题上表现良好，但性能差异显著；少梳提示对某些模型有轻微改善，但CoT提示经常导致严重性能下降（平均准确率下降11.14%）；大多数模型无法区分置信推理和演绎推理，或将通用泛化误解为普遍声明。

Conclusion: 当前的大语言模型在默认推理方面既有潜力也有限制，对置信逻辑的理解和处理能力仍需要重点关注和改进。

Abstract: This paper evaluates the capabilities of 28 large language models (LLMs) to
reason with 20 defeasible reasoning patterns involving generic generalizations
(e.g., 'Birds fly', 'Ravens are black') central to non-monotonic logic.
Generics are of special interest to linguists, philosophers, logicians, and
cognitive scientists because of their complex exception-permitting behaviour
and their centrality to default reasoning, cognition, and concept acquisition.
We find that while several frontier models handle many default reasoning
problems well, performance varies widely across models and prompting styles.
Few-shot prompting modestly improves performance for some models, but
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting often leads to serious performance degradation
(mean accuracy drop -11.14%, SD 15.74% in models performing above 75% accuracy
in zero-shot condition, temperature 0). Most models either struggle to
distinguish between defeasible and deductive inference or misinterpret generics
as universal statements. These findings underscore both the promise and limits
of current LLMs for default reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文挑战了通过预测准确性来评估词嵌入中语义知识编码的传统假设，证明即使随机信息也能被成功预测，说明预测性能主要反映向量空间几何相似性而非真正的语义表征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解深度学习模型中隐含编码的知识对于提高AI系统可解释性至关重要，但现有方法假设预测语义特征的准确性意味着词嵌入包含相应知识，这一假设需要验证。

Method: 通过分析常见词嵌入解释方法，展示这些方法即使对随机信息也能成功预测，证明预测准确性主要受算法上限而非语义内容决定。

Result: 发现预测准确性不能可靠指示真正的基于特征的可解释性，比较不同数据集时仅基于预测性能无法确定哪个数据集更好地被词嵌入捕获。

Conclusion: 词嵌入到语义特征的映射主要反映向量空间内的几何相似性，而非语义属性的真正涌现，需要更可靠的方法来评估词嵌入中的知识编码。

Abstract: Understanding what knowledge is implicitly encoded in deep learning models is
essential for improving the interpretability of AI systems. This paper examines
common methods to explain the knowledge encoded in word embeddings, which are
core elements of large language models (LLMs). These methods typically involve
mapping embeddings onto collections of human-interpretable semantic features,
known as feature norms. Prior work assumes that accurately predicting these
semantic features from the word embeddings implies that the embeddings contain
the corresponding knowledge. We challenge this assumption by demonstrating that
prediction accuracy alone does not reliably indicate genuine feature-based
interpretability.
  We show that these methods can successfully predict even random information,
concluding that the results are predominantly determined by an algorithmic
upper bound rather than meaningful semantic representation in the word
embeddings. Consequently, comparisons between datasets based solely on
prediction performance do not reliably indicate which dataset is better
captured by the word embeddings. Our analysis illustrates that such mappings
primarily reflect geometric similarity within vector spaces rather than
indicating the genuine emergence of semantic properties.

Abstract: With the widespread application of electroencephalography (EEG) in
neuroscience and clinical practice, efficiently retrieving and semantically
interpreting large-scale, multi-source, heterogeneous EEG data has become a
pressing challenge. We propose EEG-MedRAG, a three-layer hypergraph-based
retrieval-augmented generation framework that unifies EEG domain knowledge,
individual patient cases, and a large-scale repository into a traversable n-ary
relational hypergraph, enabling joint semantic-temporal retrieval and
causal-chain diagnostic generation. Concurrently, we introduce the first
cross-disease, cross-role EEG clinical QA benchmark, spanning seven disorders
and five authentic clinical perspectives. This benchmark allows systematic
evaluation of disease-agnostic generalization and role-aware contextual
understanding. Experiments show that EEG-MedRAG significantly outperforms
TimeRAG and HyperGraphRAG in answer accuracy and retrieval, highlighting its
strong potential for real-world clinical decision support. Our data and code

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究大语言模型的奇恶嫌貌问题，提出了统一评估框架和Pressure-Tune方法来提升模型的事实一致性和拒绝误导的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在需要事实严谨的领域常常显示奇恶嫌貌行为，即无论正确与否都会缘合用户信念，这在科学问答等高风险场景中带来严重风险。

Method: 提出统一评估框架来量化奇恶嫌貌上下文对模型行为的影响，包括对抗性提示设置和目标指标。还提出了Pressure-Tune方法，通过在合成对抗对话和思维链理由上进行轻量级微调来减少奇恶嫌貌行为。

Result: 在开源和专有模型上的系统评估显示了普遍的奇恶嫌貌倾向，这主要由对齐策略驱动而非模型大小。Pressure-Tune在具有挑战性的科学问答测试集上显著提升了奇恶嫌貌抵抗力，同时不影响准确性或对有效反馈的响应能力。

Conclusion: 奇恶嫌貌是大语言模型的一个重要问题，需要专门的策略来减少。Pressure-Tune提供了一种实用的解决方案，能够在保持模型准确性和响应能力的同时，提升模型的真实性和原则性行为。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), while increasingly used in domains requiring
factual rigor, often display a troubling behavior: sycophancy, the tendency to
align with user beliefs regardless of correctness. This tendency is reinforced
by preference-based alignment techniques that optimize for user satisfaction
but can undermine truthfulness. While relatively benign in casual dialogue,
sycophancy poses serious risks in high-stakes settings such as scientific
question answering (QA), where model outputs may shape collaborative reasoning,
decision-making, and knowledge formation. Despite its importance, this
phenomenon remains underexamined in factual QA contexts. We address this gap by
introducing a unified evaluation framework to quantify the impact of
sycophantic context on model behavior in scientific QA, measuring how much
user-imposed social pressure distorts model outputs. The framework incorporates
adversarial prompting setups and targeted metrics, such as misleading
resistance and sycophancy resistance, that capture a model's ability to
maintain factual consistency under misleading cues. Systematic evaluations
across open-source and proprietary models reveal pervasive sycophantic
tendencies, driven more by alignment strategy than by model size. To mitigate
this issue, we propose Pressure-Tune, a lightweight post-training method that
fine-tunes models on synthetic adversarial dialogues paired with
chain-of-thought rationales. These rationales reject user misinformation while
reinforcing factual commitments. Experiments on challenging scientific QA
benchmarks show that Pressure-Tune significantly enhances sycophancy resistance
without compromising accuracy or responsiveness to valid feedback, offering a
practical pathway toward more truthful and principled model behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器生成文本检测器在同域训练测试时表现良好，但在跨域场景下由于域偏移问题泛化能力差

Method: 从频域角度分析文本表示，发现不同域间存在一致的频谱模式，但机器生成文本与人类撰写文本在幅度上存在显著差异。设计了低频域过滤模块过滤对域偏移敏感的文档级特征，以及动态频谱对齐策略提取任务特定和域不变特征

Conclusion: 频域分析为机器生成文本检测提供了新的视角，MGT-Prism方法在跨域检测中表现出色，为解决域偏移问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: Large Language Models have shown growing ability to generate fluent and
coherent texts that are highly similar to the writing style of humans. Current
detectors for Machine-Generated Text (MGT) perform well when they are trained
and tested in the same domain but generalize poorly to unseen domains, due to
domain shift between data from different sources. In this work, we propose
MGT-Prism, an MGT detection method from the perspective of the frequency domain
for better domain generalization. Our key insight stems from analyzing text
representations in the frequency domain, where we observe consistent spectral
patterns across diverse domains, while significant discrepancies in magnitude
emerge between MGT and human-written texts (HWTs). The observation initiates
the design of a low frequency domain filtering module for filtering out the
document-level features that are sensitive to domain shift, and a dynamic
spectrum alignment strategy to extract the task-specific and domain-invariant
features for improving the detector's performance in domain generalization.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGT-Prism outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by an average of 0.90% in accuracy and 0.92% in F1 score on 11 test
datasets across three domain-generalization scenarios.

Motivation: 评估LLM生成文本是否能够模仿儿童语言特征，以确定其在教育应用中的适宜性。

Method: 使用图片故事作为提示，通过零次提示和少量提示生成两个LLM语料库，与德语儿童描述语料进行对比分析，包括词频、词汇丰富度、句长、词性标注和语义相似性等心理语言属性。

Result: LLM生成文本长度更长但词汇丰富度更低，更多依赖高频词，名词使用不足，语料库语义相似度低。少量提示仅能轻微提升相似性，但仍无法复现儿童语言的词汇和语义模式。

Conclusion: LLM在模仿儿童语言方面有限，在教育应用中需谨慎考虑其适宜性，这为多模态提示方式和心理语言研究提供了见解。

Abstract: The role of large language models (LLMs) in education is increasing, yet
little attention has been paid to whether LLM-generated text resembles child
language. This study evaluates how LLMs replicate child-like language by
comparing LLM-generated texts to a collection of German children's descriptions
of picture stories. We generated two LLM-based corpora using the same picture
stories and two prompt types: zero-shot and few-shot prompts specifying a
general age from the children corpus. We conducted a comparative analysis
across psycholinguistic text properties, including word frequency, lexical
richness, sentence and word length, part-of-speech tags, and semantic
similarity with word embeddings. The results show that LLM-generated texts are
longer but less lexically rich, rely more on high-frequency words, and
under-represent nouns. Semantic vector space analysis revealed low similarity,
highlighting differences between the two corpora on the level of corpus
semantics. Few-shot prompt increased similarities between children and LLM text
to a minor extent, but still failed to replicate lexical and semantic patterns.
The findings contribute to our understanding of how LLMs approximate child
language through multimodal prompting (text + image) and give insights into
their use in psycholinguistic research and education while raising important
questions about the appropriateness of LLM-generated language in child-directed
educational tools.

*Bohao Chu,Meijie Li,Sameh Frihat,Chengyu Gu,Georg Lodde,Elisabeth Livingstone,Norbert Fuhr*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TracSum是一个用于可追溯、基于方面的医学摘要生成的新基准，包含500个医学摘要的3.5K摘要-引用对，提供细粒度评估框架和基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM生成医学摘要时事实准确性不足的问题，通过句子级引用追溯让用户能够验证摘要的准确性。

Method: 提出TracSum基准数据集，包含七个关键医学方面的标注；设计四指标评估框架；提出Track-Then-Sum基线方法（先追踪句子再摘要）。

Result: 实验表明TracSum可作为有效基准，显式执行句子级追踪能提高生成准确性，结合完整上下文能进一步提升完整性。

Conclusion: TracSum为可追溯、基于方面的摘要任务提供了有价值的基准，追踪机制和完整上下文对提升医学摘要质量至关重要。

Abstract: While document summarization with LLMs has enhanced access to textual
information, concerns about the factual accuracy of these summaries persist,
especially in the medical domain. Tracing evidence from which summaries are
derived enables users to assess their accuracy, thereby alleviating this
concern. In this paper, we introduce TracSum, a novel benchmark for traceable,
aspect-based summarization, in which generated summaries are paired with
sentence-level citations, enabling users to trace back to the original context.
First, we annotate 500 medical abstracts for seven key medical aspects,
yielding 3.5K summary-citation pairs. We then propose a fine-grained evaluation
framework for this new task, designed to assess the completeness and
consistency of generated content using four metrics. Finally, we introduce a
summarization pipeline, Track-Then-Sum, which serves as a baseline method for
comparison. In experiments, we evaluate both this baseline and a set of LLMs on
TracSum, and conduct a human evaluation to assess the evaluation results. The
findings demonstrate that TracSum can serve as an effective benchmark for
traceable, aspect-based summarization tasks. We also observe that explicitly
performing sentence-level tracking prior to summarization enhances generation
accuracy, while incorporating the full context further improves completeness.

*Maciej Skorski,Alina Landowska*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这项研究通过贝叶斯方法评估了大语言模型在道德判断上的表现，发现AI模型通常能排在人类注释者前25%，且有更高的道德检测敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 之前的研究多使用确定性真实值（多数决或包含规则），无法抓取注释者之间的争议和不确定性。本研究旨在通过模型化注释者争议来更全面地评估语言模型的道德理解能力。

Method: 采用GPU优化的贝叶斯框架，模型化注释者争议以抓取绝绝不确定性（人类内在争议）和认知不确定性（模型领域敏感性）。评估顶级语言模型（Claude Sonnet 4、DeepSeek-V3、Llama 4 Maverick），基于70余位注释者的25万+注释和10万+文本数据。

Result: AI模型通常能排在人类注释者前25%，达到较优的平衡准确率。关键发现是AI产生的假阶性错误比人类要少得多，显示出更高的道德检测敏感性。处理了100万+模型查询。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在道德判断上表现出了超过人类平均水平的能力，尤其是在避免假阶性错误方面显示出更高的敏感性。这为AI模型在道德理解方面的应用提供了重要参考。

Abstract: How do large language models understand moral dimensions compared to humans?
  This first large-scale Bayesian evaluation of market-leading language models
provides the answer. In contrast to prior work using deterministic ground truth
(majority or inclusion rules), we model annotator disagreements to capture both
aleatoric uncertainty (inherent human disagreement) and epistemic uncertainty
(model domain sensitivity). We evaluate top language models (Claude Sonnet 4,
DeepSeek-V3, Llama 4 Maverick) across 250K+ annotations from ~700 annotators on
100K+ texts spanning social media, news, and forums.
  Our GPU-optimized Bayesian framework processed 1M+ model queries, revealing
that AI models typically rank among the top 25\% of human annotators, achieving
much better-than-average balanced accuracy. Importantly, we find that AI
produces far fewer false negatives than humans, highlighting their more
sensitive moral detection capabilities.

*Juncheng Xie,Hung-yi Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过插入计数器标记和计数规则的提示工程方法，使得大语言模型能够准确控制生成文本的长度，将GPT-4.1的严格长度遵循率从30%以下提升到95%以上


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在生成文本时经常无法可靠地进行内部词段计数，导致生成文本长度超过或不足明确的长度指令

Method: 提出一种基于提示的一次投射策略，通过在提示中添加倒计时标记和明确的计数规则，使模型在写作过程中同时进行计数

Result: 在MT-Bench-LI任务中，GPT-4.1的严格长度遵循率从原本不足30%提升到95%以下，超越了常见的草稿-然后修订基线方法，同时保持了评价质量

Conclusion: 经过工程的提示方法可以单独实现准确的长度控制，提供了一种轻量级的替代方案，无需进行训练或迭代采样

Abstract: Controlling the length of text produced by large language models (LLMs)
remains challenging: models frequently overshoot or undershoot explicit length
instructions because they cannot reliably keep an internal token count. We
present a prompt-based, one-shot strategy that compels an off-the-shelf LLM to
generate exactly a desired number of tokens - words (English) or characters
(Chinese) - without any fine-tuning or iterative sampling. The prompt appends
countdown markers and explicit counting rules so that the model "writes while
counting." We evaluate on four settings: open-ended generation (1-1000 tokens),
XSUM summarization, MT-Bench-LI instruction following, and the LIFEBENCH
equal-length track. On MT-Bench-LI, strict length compliance with GPT-4.1 leaps
from below 30% under naive prompts to above 95% with our countdown prompt,
surpassing the popular draft-then-revise baseline, while judged answer quality
is preserved. These results show that precise length control can be achieved
through prompt engineering alone, offering a lightweight alternative to
training- or decoding-based methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 自动评估指标在NLG预计人类判断方面存在显著缺陷，无论是传统词法比较、语义相似度模型还是最新的LLM评估方法都无法成为完美解决方案，需要根据具体任务选择指标并采用互补性评估方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动评估指标在自然语言生成预计人类判断方面存在显著缺陷，但现有研究常随意使用不同指标而不考虑其影响，需要系统性分析现有指标的方法论、优缺点和验证方法

Method: 对现有自动评估指标进行彻底检查，包括其方法论、文档化优势和局限性、验证方法以及与人类判断的相关性

Result: 发现指标通常只能抓取文本质量的特定方面，效果因任务和数据集而异，验证实践结构化不足，与人类判断的相关性不一致，这些问题在LLM评估方法和RAG任务中仍存在

Conclusion: 对完美评估指标的追求是不现实的，建议根据任务特定需求选择指标，利用互补性评估方法，新指标应重点关注改进的验证方法论

Abstract: Evaluating Natural Language Generation (NLG) is crucial for the practical
adoption of AI, but has been a longstanding research challenge. While human
evaluation is considered the de-facto standard, it is expensive and lacks
scalability. Practical applications have driven the development of various
automatic evaluation metrics (AEM), designed to compare the model output with
human-written references, generating a score which approximates human judgment.
Over time, AEMs have evolved from simple lexical comparisons, to semantic
similarity models and, more recently, to LLM-based evaluators. However, it
seems that no single metric has emerged as a definitive solution, resulting in
studies using different ones without fully considering the implications. This
paper aims to show this by conducting a thorough examination of the
methodologies of existing metrics, their documented strengths and limitations,
validation methods, and correlations with human judgment. We identify several
key challenges: metrics often capture only specific aspects of text quality,
their effectiveness varies by task and dataset, validation practices remain
unstructured, and correlations with human judgment are inconsistent.
Importantly, we find that these challenges persist in the most recent type of
metric, LLM-as-a-Judge, as well as in the evaluation of Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG), an increasingly relevant task in academia and industry. Our
findings challenge the quest for the 'perfect metric'. We propose selecting
metrics based on task-specific needs and leveraging complementary evaluations
and advocate that new metrics should focus on enhanced validation
methodologies.

Abstract: This study explores the integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM)
with Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automate the extraction of
requirements from unstructured French Building Technical Specification (BTS)
documents within the construction industry. Employing Named Entity Recognition
(NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) techniques, the study leverages the
transformer-based model CamemBERT and applies transfer learning with the French
language model Fr\_core\_news\_lg, both pre-trained on a large French corpus in
the general domain. To benchmark these models, additional approaches ranging
from rule-based to deep learning-based methods are developed. For RE, four
different supervised models, including Random Forest, are implemented using a
custom feature vector. A hand-crafted annotated dataset is used to compare the
effectiveness of NER approaches and RE models. Results indicate that CamemBERT
and Fr\_core\_news\_lg exhibited superior performance in NER, achieving
F1-scores over 90\%, while Random Forest proved most effective in RE, with an
F1 score above 80\%. The outcomes are intended to be represented as a knowledge
graph in future work to further enhance automatic verification systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MME-SCI是一个针对多模态大语言模型的科学领域综合评测基准，涵盖数学、物理、化学、生物四大学科，支持五种语言，包含1019个高质量问答对，评测显示现有模型在该基准上表现不佳，特别是在图像推理方面存在显著挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有科学领域评测基准存在三个主要问题：多语言场景下推理能力评估不足、多模态覆盖不全面、科学知识点标注粒度不够细。为了解决这些问题，作者提出了MME-SCI基准。

Method: 收集了1019个高质量问答对，涵盖四大学科（数学、物理、化学、生物）和五种语言（中文、英文、法文、西班牙文、日文），包含3种评测模式。在16个开源模型和4个闭源模型上进行了广泛实验。

Result: 评测结果显示MME-SCI对现有MLLMs具有广泛挑战性。在仅图像评测模式下，o4-mini在数学、物理、化学、生物上的准确率分别仅为52.11%、24.73%、36.57%和29.80%，难度显著高于现有基准。

Conclusion: MME-SCI是一个全面且具有挑战性的基准，能够深入分析现有模型在多语言和细粒度科学知识方面的性能表现，识别其在特定领域的弱点，为多模态大语言模型在科学推理方面的发展提供了重要评测工具。

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved significant
advancements across various domains, and corresponding evaluation benchmarks
have been continuously refined and improved. In this process, benchmarks in the
scientific domain have played an important role in assessing the reasoning
capabilities of MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks still face three key
challenges: 1) Insufficient evaluation of models' reasoning abilities in
multilingual scenarios; 2) Inadequate assessment of MLLMs' comprehensive
modality coverage; 3) Lack of fine-grained annotation of scientific knowledge
points. To address these gaps, we propose MME-SCI, a comprehensive and
challenging benchmark. We carefully collected 1,019 high-quality
question-answer pairs, which involve 3 distinct evaluation modes. These pairs
cover four subjects, namely mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, and
support five languages: Chinese, English, French, Spanish, and Japanese. We
conducted extensive experiments on 16 open-source models and 4 closed-source
models, and the results demonstrate that MME-SCI is widely challenging for
existing MLLMs. For instance, under the Image-only evaluation mode, o4-mini
achieved accuracy of only 52.11%, 24.73%, 36.57%, and 29.80% in mathematics,
physics, chemistry, and biology, respectively, indicating a significantly
higher difficulty level compared to existing benchmarks. More importantly,
using MME-SCI's multilingual and fine-grained knowledge attributes, we analyzed
existing models' performance in depth and identified their weaknesses in
specific domains. The Data and Evaluation Code are available at

Motivation: 酒店行业需要理解影响客户评分的因素来提升客户满意度和业务表现，传统NLP方法在可解释性和计算效率方面存在局限。

Method: 将文本评论转换为包含(主语,谓语,宾语)三元组和情感分数的知识图谱，使用Node2Vec图嵌入和情感特征，通过机器学习分类器预测评分。

Result: 在HotelRec数据集上，ReviewGraph性能与最佳文献模型相当但计算成本更低，在Cohen's Kappa等一致性指标上优于基线方法，与LLM性能相当。

Conclusion: 基于图的表示方法在评论分析中具有潜力，提供了更好的可解释性和可视化探索能力，为未来集成图神经网络和微调LLM提取方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: In the hospitality industry, understanding the factors that drive customer
review ratings is critical for improving guest satisfaction and business
performance. This work proposes ReviewGraph for Review Rating Prediction (RRP),
a novel framework that transforms textual customer reviews into knowledge
graphs by extracting (subject, predicate, object) triples and associating
sentiment scores. Using graph embeddings (Node2Vec) and sentiment features, the
framework predicts review rating scores through machine learning classifiers.
We compare ReviewGraph performance with traditional NLP baselines (such as Bag
of Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec) and large language models (LLMs), evaluating
them in the HotelRec dataset. In comparison to the state of the art literature,
our proposed model performs similar to their best performing model but with
lower computational cost (without ensemble).
  While ReviewGraph achieves comparable predictive performance to LLMs and
outperforms baselines on agreement-based metrics such as Cohen's Kappa, it
offers additional advantages in interpretability, visual exploration, and
potential integration into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. This
work highlights the potential of graph-based representations for enhancing
review analytics and lays the groundwork for future research integrating
advanced graph neural networks and fine-tuned LLM-based extraction methods. We
will share ReviewGraph output and platform open-sourced on our GitHub page

Result: 显著提升了偏好数据对的多样性和质量，在长文本推理基准测试中达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: LongMab-PO框架通过探索-利用机制有效识别关键文本片段，为长文本建模提供了高质量的训练数据生成方法

Abstract: Long-context modeling is critical for a wide range of real-world tasks,
including long-context question answering, summarization, and complex reasoning
tasks. Recent studies have explored fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs)
with synthetic data to enhance their long-context capabilities. However, the
effectiveness of such approaches is often limited by the low diversity and
factual inconsistencies in the generated data. To address these challenges, we
propose LongMab-PO, a novel framework that leverages a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)
rollout strategy to identify the most informative chunks from the given long
context for sampling high-quality and diverse responses and constructing
preference data pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training.
Specifically, we treat context chunks as arms of MAB, select chunks based on
their expected reward scores to input into LLMs to generate responses, and
iteratively update these scores based on reward feedback. This exploration and
exploitation process enables the model to focus on the most relevant context
segments, thereby generating and collecting high-quality and diverse responses.
Finally, we collect these generated responses from the rollout process and
apply the DPO method to further optimize the LLM. Experimental results show
that LongMab-PO significantly improves the diversity and quality of preference
data pairs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on long-context reasoning
benchmarks. All code and data will be released on

TL;DR: 提出SvS策略，通过自对弈和变分问题合成来维持RLVR训练中的策略熵，显著提升Pass@k性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLVR训练在提升Pass@1性能时会降低策略熵，导致生成多样性下降并限制Pass@k性能

Method: 在线自对弈变分问题合成策略(SvS)，利用策略的正确解合成变分问题同时保持参考答案不变

Result: 在AIME24和AIME25基准上Pass@32性能分别获得18.3%和22.8%的绝对提升，在12个推理基准上一致有效

Conclusion: SvS策略能有效维持训练过程中的策略熵，显著改善Pass@k性能，具有良好泛化性和鲁棒性

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a key paradigm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for
complex reasoning tasks. However, vanilla RLVR training has been shown to
improve Pass@1 performance at the expense of policy entropy, leading to reduced
generation diversity and limiting the Pass@k performance, which typically
represents the upper bound of LLM reasoning capability. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the policy's generation diversity from the perspective
of training problems and find that augmenting and updating training problems
helps mitigate entropy collapse during training. Based on these observations,
we propose an online Self-play with Variational problem Synthesis (SvS)
strategy for RLVR training, which uses the policy's correct solutions to
synthesize variational problems while ensuring their reference answers remain
identical to the originals. This self-improving strategy effectively maintains
policy entropy during training and substantially improves Pass@k compared with
standard RLVR, sustaining prolonged improvements and achieving absolute gains
of 18.3% and 22.8% in Pass@32 performance on the competition-level AIME24 and
AIME25 benchmarks. Experiments on 12 reasoning benchmarks across varying model
sizes from 3B to 32B consistently demonstrate the generalizability and
robustness of SvS.

Motivation: 大语言模型向组织器系统演化过程中，细调可能导致对齐的LLM变得错位，增加执行有害任务的风险。需要解决细调过程中安全问题被忽视的问题。

Method: 提出Prefix INjection Guard (PING)方法，通过迭代方式生成和选择自然语言前缀：(1)生成候选前缀 (2)选择能同时优化任务性能和拒绝行为的前缀。

Result: 实验结果显示PING显著提升了细调后LLM组织器的安全性，而不爆发其有效性。在网页导航和代码生成任务的多样化测试中均超过现有提示方法。

Conclusion: 通过线性探针分析发现，前缀token对行为修改至关重要，这解释了PING的性能提升。PING为LLM组织器的安全部署提供了简单有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Beyond simple text generation, Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into
agentic systems capable of planning and interacting with external tools to
solve complex tasks. This evolution involves fine-tuning LLMs on agent-specific
tasks to enhance their proficiency. However, safety concerns are frequently
overlooked during this fine-tuning process. In this work, we show that aligned
LLMs can become unintentionally misaligned, leading to a higher likelihood of
executing harmful tasks and a reduced tendency to refuse them when fine-tuned
to execute agentic tasks. To address these safety challenges, we propose Prefix
INjection Guard (PING), a simple yet effective method that prepends
automatically generated natural language prefixes to agent responses, guiding
them to refuse harmful requests while preserving performance on benign tasks.
Specifically, we introduce an iterative approach that alternates between (1)
generating candidate prefixes and (2) selecting those that optimize both task
performance and refusal behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that PING
significantly enhances the safety of fine-tuned LLM agents without sacrificing
their effectiveness. PING consistently outperforms existing prompting
approaches across diverse benchmarks in both web navigation and code generation
tasks. Our analysis of internal hidden states via linear probes reveals that
prefix tokens are crucial for behavior modification, explaining the performance
gains. WARNING: This paper contains contents that are unethical or offensive in

Motivation: 数字健康分析面临关键挑战：患者生成的健康内容包含复杂的情感和医疗背景，需要稀缺的领域专业知识，而传统ML方法在医疗环境中受到数据短缺和隐私限制的约束。在线健康社区(OHCs)中的混合情感帖子、临床术语和隐含情感表达需要专业知识进行准确的情感分析。

Method: 开发结构化编码本系统编码专家解释指南，通过针对性提示使LLMs应用领域特定知识。使用6个GPT模型、DeepSeek和LLaMA 3.1验证，与预训练语言模型(BioBERT变体)和基于词典的方法进行比较，使用来自两个OHCs的400个专家标注帖子。

Result: LLMs实现了卓越性能，同时表现出专家级别的共识。这种高共识水平与专家间共识水平无统计学显著差异，表明知识整合超越了表面模式识别。不同LLM模型的一致性能，加上上下文学习的支持，为数字健康分析提供了有前景的解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了数字健康研究中专家知识短缺的关键挑战，能够为患者监测、干预评估和循证健康策略提供实时、专家质量的分析。

Abstract: Digital health analytics face critical challenges nowadays. The sophisticated
analysis of patient-generated health content, which contains complex emotional
and medical contexts, requires scarce domain expertise, while traditional ML
approaches are constrained by data shortage and privacy limitations in
healthcare settings. Online Health Communities (OHCs) exemplify these
challenges with mixed-sentiment posts, clinical terminology, and implicit
emotional expressions that demand specialised knowledge for accurate Sentiment
Analysis (SA). To address these challenges, this study explores how Large
Language Models (LLMs) can integrate expert knowledge through in-context
learning for SA, providing a scalable solution for sophisticated health data
analysis. Specifically, we develop a structured codebook that systematically
encodes expert interpretation guidelines, enabling LLMs to apply
domain-specific knowledge through targeted prompting rather than extensive
training. Six GPT models validated alongside DeepSeek and LLaMA 3.1 are
compared with pre-trained language models (BioBERT variants) and lexicon-based
methods, using 400 expert-annotated posts from two OHCs. LLMs achieve superior
performance while demonstrating expert-level agreement. This high agreement,
with no statistically significant difference from inter-expert agreement
levels, suggests knowledge integration beyond surface-level pattern
recognition. The consistent performance across diverse LLM models, supported by
in-context learning, offers a promising solution for digital health analytics.
This approach addresses the critical challenge of expert knowledge shortage in
digital health research, enabling real-time, expert-quality analysis for
patient monitoring, intervention assessment, and evidence-based health
strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低轨卫星网络（如Starlink）虽然能填补互联网覆盖空白，但现有的直播平台和ABR算法无法有效处理卫星切换导致的网络突变，造成频繁的视频卡顿。

Method: 开发了轻量级中间件SARA，可与各种ABR算法无缝集成，通过智能播放速度调节和提供卫星网络特性信息来辅助比特率选择决策。

Abstract: Live streaming has experienced significant growth recently. Yet this rise in
popularity contrasts with the reality that a substantial segment of the global
population still lacks Internet access. The emergence of Low Earth orbit
Satellite Networks (LSNs), such as SpaceX's Starlink and Amazon's Project
Kuiper, presents a promising solution to fill this gap. Nevertheless, our
measurement study reveals that existing live streaming platforms may not be
able to deliver a smooth viewing experience on LSNs due to frequent satellite
handovers, which lead to frequent video rebuffering events. Current
state-of-the-art learning-based Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) algorithms, even when
trained on LSNs' network traces, fail to manage the abrupt network variations
associated with satellite handovers effectively. To address these challenges,
for the first time, we introduce Satellite-Aware Rate Adaptation (SARA), a
versatile and lightweight middleware that can seamlessly integrate with various
ABR algorithms to enhance the performance of live streaming over LSNs. SARA
intelligently modulates video playback speed and furnishes ABR algorithms with
insights derived from the distinctive network characteristics of LSNs, thereby
aiding ABR algorithms in making informed bitrate selections and effectively
minimizing rebuffering events that occur during satellite handovers. Our
extensive evaluation shows that SARA can effectively reduce the rebuffering
time by an average of $39.41\%$ and slightly improve latency by $0.65\%$ while
only introducing an overall loss in bitrate by $0.13\%$.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: INDS是一个基于信息中心网络的点云视频自适应流媒体框架，通过八叉树结构和内容命名支持渐进式分层检索，相比现有DASH系统显著降低延迟、提高吞吐量和缓存命中率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实时点云视频流在动态网络条件下的大数据量和丢包敏感性问题，现有TCP/QUIC协议的分段传输模式和集中控制限制了细粒度适应性和有效缓存。

Method: 利用点云视频的八叉树结构和表达性内容命名，支持基于消费者带宽和解码能力的增强层渐进式部分检索，结合时间窗口和帧组(Gof)命名方案实现细粒度网络内缓存。

Result: 原型实现显示相比最先进的DASH系统：延迟降低80%，吞吐量提高15-50%，缓存命中率提高20-30%。

Conclusion: INDS是可变和丢包条件下实时点云流媒体的可扩展、缓存友好解决方案，与MoQ覆盖网络的兼容性使其成为新兴沉浸式媒体系统的实用、向前兼容架构。

Abstract: Real-time streaming of point cloud video, characterized by massive data
volumes and high sensitivity to packet loss, remains a key challenge for
immersive applications under dynamic network conditions. While
connection-oriented protocols such as TCP and more modern alternatives like
QUIC alleviate some transport-layer inefficiencies, including head-of-line
blocking, they still retain a coarse-grained, segment-based delivery model and
a centralized control loop that limit fine-grained adaptation and effective
caching. We introduce INDS (Incremental Named Data Streaming), an adaptive
streaming framework based on Information-Centric Networking (ICN) that rethinks
delivery for hierarchical, layered media. INDS leverages the Octree structure
of point cloud video and expressive content naming to support progressive,
partial retrieval of enhancement layers based on consumer bandwidth and
decoding capability. By combining time-windows with Group-of-Frames (GoF),
INDS's naming scheme supports fine-grained in-network caching and facilitates
efficient multi-user data reuse. INDS can be deployed as an overlay, remaining
compatible with QUIC-based transport infrastructure as well as future
Media-over-QUIC (MoQ) architectures, without requiring changes to underlying IP
networks. Our prototype implementation shows up to 80% lower delay, 15-50%
higher throughput, and 20-30% increased cache hit rates compared to
state-of-the-art DASH-style systems. Together, these results establish INDS as
a scalable, cache-friendly solution for real-time point cloud streaming under
variable and lossy conditions, while its compatibility with MoQ overlays
further positions it as a practical, forward-compatible architecture for
emerging immersive media systems.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种不确定性感知学习策略，通过同时学习医生的背景知识和肺部病变来提高医疗AI在肺癌诊断中的准确性和可信过程


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗AI诊断中的不确定性问题，提高医生对AI系统的信任度，代替传统的单纯病变学习模式

Method: 使用Uncertainty-Aware Learning Policy，同时学习医生背景知识和胸部X光片病变信息，基于Ajou大学医院2,517张无病变图像和656张结节图像

Result: 模型达到92%准确率（IoU 0.2 / FPPI 2），敏感度比基准模型提高10%，不确定性指标燃效降低0.2

Conclusion: 通过学习医生背景知识，可以有效减少医疗AI诊断中的不确定性，提高诊断准确性和可靠性，促进临床应用

Abstract: Early detection and rapid intervention of lung cancer are crucial.
Nonetheless, ensuring an accurate diagnosis is challenging, as physicians'
ability to interpret chest X-rays varies significantly depending on their
experience and degree of fatigue. Although medical AI has been rapidly
advancing to assist in diagnosis, physicians' trust in such systems remains
limited, preventing widespread clinical adoption. This skepticism fundamentally
stems from concerns about its diagnostic uncertainty. In clinical diagnosis,
physicians utilize extensive background knowledge and clinical experience. In
contrast, medical AI primarily relies on repetitive learning of the target
lesion to generate diagnoses based solely on that data. In other words, medical
AI does not possess sufficient knowledge to render a diagnosis, leading to
diagnostic uncertainty. Thus, this study suggests an Uncertainty-Aware Learning
Policy that can address the issue of knowledge deficiency by learning the
physicians' background knowledge alongside the Chest X-ray lesion information.
We used 2,517 lesion-free images and 656 nodule images, all obtained from Ajou
University Hospital. The proposed model attained 92% (IoU 0.2 / FPPI 2) with a
10% enhancement in sensitivity compared to the baseline model while also
decreasing entropy as a measure of uncertainty by 0.2.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种结合多种突可性机制的生物受启制制策略，用于改善刺激神经网络的训练效果和稳健性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的SNN训练方法通常只使用单一的突可性机制，而大脑中存在多种协同学习策略，这限制了SNN的适应性和表现能力。

Method: 设计了一种生物受启的训练框架，让多种学习算法协同调节信息积累，同时保持各自相对独立的更新动力学。

Result: 在静态图像和动态神经科学数据集上评估，证明该框架在性能和稳健性方面显著优于传统学习机制模型。

Conclusion: 这项工作为发展更强大的多策略脑受启学习SNN提供了一个通用且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising brain-inspired models known for
low power consumption and superior potential for temporal processing, but
identifying suitable learning mechanisms remains a challenge. Despite the
presence of multiple coexisting learning strategies in the brain, current SNN
training methods typically rely on a single form of synaptic plasticity, which
limits their adaptability and representational capability. In this paper, we
propose a biologically inspired training framework that incorporates multiple
synergistic plasticity mechanisms for more effective SNN training. Our method
enables diverse learning algorithms to cooperatively modulate the accumulation
of information, while allowing each mechanism to preserve its own relatively
independent update dynamics. We evaluated our approach on both static image and
dynamic neuromorphic datasets to demonstrate that our framework significantly
improves performance and robustness compared to conventional learning mechanism
models. This work provides a general and extensible foundation for developing
more powerful SNNs guided by multi-strategy brain-inspired learning.

Motivation: 发现遗传编程算法在符号回归中存在大量重复访问和重复评估搜索空间点的问题，导致计算资源浪费

Result: 在实际回归问题上实现了最高达34%的速度提升，且不会对搜索质量产生负面影响

Conclusion: Zobrist哈希缓存方法是一种简单有效的性能优化方案，同时为基于缓存信息调整搜索策略提供了可能性

Abstract: Symbolic regression encompasses a family of search algorithms that aim to
discover the best fitting function for a set of data without requiring an a
priori specification of the model structure. The most successful and commonly
used technique for symbolic regression is Genetic Programming (GP), an
evolutionary search method that evolves a population of mathematical
expressions through the mechanism of natural selection. In this work we analyze
the efficiency of the evolutionary search in GP and show that many points in
the search space are re-visited and re-evaluated multiple times by the
algorithm, leading to wasted computational effort. We address this issue by
introducing a caching mechanism based on the Zobrist hash, a type of hashing
frequently used in abstract board games for the efficient construction and
subsequent update of transposition tables. We implement our caching approach
using the open-source framework Operon and demonstrate its performance on a
selection of real-world regression problems, where we observe up to 34\%
speedups without any detrimental effects on search quality. The hashing
approach represents a straightforward way to improve runtime performance while
also offering some interesting possibilities for adjusting search strategy
based on cached information.

Motivation: 解决图表视觉问答这一自然语言理解中的挑战性子任务，需要模型同时处理视觉和语言信息

Method: 开发基于VisualBERT的BERT-VQA模型，使用预训练的ResNet 101图像编码器，可能加入联合融合模块，并与基于LSTM、CNN和浅层分类器的基线模型对比

Result: 实验结果否定了核心假设，即VisualBERT的跨模态模块对于图表组件与问题短语的对齐并非必需

Conclusion: 研究揭示了图表问答任务的难度，并为不同模型架构在此问题上的适用性提供了有价值的见解

Abstract: Visual question answering has been an exciting challenge in the field of
natural language understanding, as it requires deep learning models to exchange
information from both vision and language domains. In this project, we aim to
tackle a subtask of this problem, namely visual question answering on plots. To
achieve this, we developed BERT-VQA, a VisualBERT-based model architecture with
a pretrained ResNet 101 image encoder, along with a potential addition of joint
fusion. We trained and evaluated this model against a baseline that consisted
of a LSTM, a CNN, and a shallow classifier. The final outcome disproved our
core hypothesis that the cross-modality module in VisualBERT is essential in
aligning plot components with question phrases. Therefore, our work provided
valuable insights into the difficulty of the plot question answering challenge
as well as the appropriateness of different model architectures in solving this
problem.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach for multimodal sentiment analysis on
social media, particularly in the context of natural disasters, where
understanding public sentiment is crucial for effective crisis management.
Unlike conventional methods that process text and image modalities separately,
our approach seamlessly integrates Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based
image analysis with Large Language Model (LLM) based text processing,
leveraging Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) and prompt engineering to
extract sentiment relevant features from the CrisisMMD dataset. To effectively
model intermodal relationships, we introduce a contextual attention mechanism
within the fusion process. Leveraging contextual-attention layers, this
mechanism effectively captures intermodality interactions, enhancing the
model's comprehension of complex relationships between textual and visual data.
The deep neural network architecture of our model learns from these fused
features, leading to improved accuracy compared to existing baselines.
Experimental results demonstrate significant advancements in classifying social
media data into informative and noninformative categories across various
natural disasters. Our model achieves a notable 2.43% increase in accuracy and
5.18% in F1-score, highlighting its efficacy in processing complex multimodal
data. Beyond quantitative metrics, our approach provides deeper insight into
the sentiments expressed during crises. The practical implications extend to
real time disaster management, where enhanced sentiment analysis can optimize
the accuracy of emergency interventions. By bridging the gap between multimodal
analysis, LLM powered text understanding, and disaster response, our work
presents a promising direction for Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven crisis
management solutions. Keywords:

Motivation: 物理信息神经网络在求解微分方程方面展现出潜力，但其性能受多种因素影响，特别是训练点分布这一核心组件尚未得到系统研究。

Method: 使用两个常微分方程和两个偏微分方程，测试五种训练数据生成策略（包括新提出的基于正弦的训练点），采用浅层网络架构（1-2个隐藏层），并使用随机和固定种子权重初始化确保可重复性。

Result: 研究结果显示训练点分布对解精度有显著影响，并发现训练点分布与微分方程的特性存在关联。

Conclusion: 训练点分布是影响物理信息神经网络性能的关键因素，需要根据具体微分方程特性进行针对性选择。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks approach the approximation of differential
equations by directly incorporating their structure and given conditions in a
loss function. This enables conditions like, e.g., invariants to be easily
added during the modelling phase. In addition, the approach can be considered
as mesh free and can be utilised to compute solutions on arbitrary grids after
the training phase. Therefore, physics-informed neural networks are emerging as
a promising alternative to solving differential equations with methods from
numerical mathematics. However, their performance highly depends on a large
variety of factors. In this paper, we systematically investigate and evaluate a
core component of the approach, namely the training point distribution. We test
two ordinary and two partial differential equations with five strategies for
training data generation and shallow network architectures, with one and two
hidden layers. In addition to common distributions, we introduce sine-based
training points, which are motivated by the construction of Chebyshev nodes.
The results are challenged by using certain parameter combinations like, e.g.,
random and fixed-seed weight initialisation for reproducibility. The results
show the impact of the training point distributions on the solution accuracy
and we find evidence that they are connected to the characteristics of the
differential equation.

Method: 使用历史元知识来选择有前景的搜索空间区域，通过动态设计搜索空间以加速优化过程。

Result: 在Random Search中减少89%运行时间，搜索空间大幅缩小（预处理器从13个减到1.8个，分类器从16个减到4.3个），且预测性能无显著损失。在Auto-Sklearn中也表现竞争力。

Conclusion: 该元学习方法能够有效加速AutoML过程，为搜索空间缩减策略提供了见解，包括元特征选择和元模型可解释性等方面。

Abstract: Automated machine learning (AutoML) has democratized the design of machine
learning based systems, by automating model selection, hyperparameter tuning
and feature engineering. However, the high computational cost associated with
traditional search and optimization strategies, such as Random Search, Particle
Swarm Optimization and Bayesian Optimization, remains a significant challenge.
Moreover, AutoML systems typically explore a large search space, which can lead
to overfitting. This paper introduces a metalearning method for dynamically
designing search spaces for AutoML system. The proposed method uses historical
metaknowledge to select promising regions of the search space, accelerating the
optimization process. According to experiments conducted for this study, the
proposed method can reduce runtime by 89\% in Random Search and search space by
(1.8/13 preprocessor and 4.3/16 classifier), without compromising significant
predictive performance. Moreover, the proposed method showed competitive
performance when adapted to Auto-Sklearn, reducing its search space.
Furthermore, this study encompasses insights into meta-feature selection,
meta-model explainability, and the trade-offs inherent in search space
reduction strategies.

Conclusion: DGNPP有效解决了先前方法的局限性，通过整合网络拓扑结构和时序动态信息，在时间交互网络学习中取得了突破性进展。

Abstract: Learning temporal interaction networks(TIN) is previously regarded as a
coarse-grained multi-sequence prediction problem, ignoring the network topology
structure influence. This paper addresses this limitation and a Deep Graph
Neural Point Process(DGNPP) model for TIN is proposed. DGNPP consists of two
key modules: the Node Aggregation Layer and the Self Attentive Layer. The Node
Aggregation Layer captures topological structures to generate static
representation for users and items, while the Self Attentive Layer dynamically
updates embeddings over time. By incorporating both dynamic and static
embeddings into the event intensity function and optimizing the model via
maximum likelihood estimation, DGNPP predicts events and occurrence time
effectively. Experimental evaluations on three public datasets demonstrate that
DGNPP achieves superior performance in event prediction and time prediction
tasks with high efficiency, significantly outperforming baseline models and
effectively mitigating the limitations of prior approaches.

Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在复杂图像标注任务中存在推理能力不足的问题。标准监督微调只关注标注结果而忽略推理过程，而视觉强化微调由于缺乏高质量验证的思维链导致推理不一致。

Method: RISE框架包含两个阶段：1) Reason阶段(RISE-CoT)：使用强化学习驱动的"标注-推理-标注"闭环生成视觉基础、逻辑一致的思维链；2) Inspire和Strengthen阶段(RISE-R1)：利用高质量CoT子集进行监督微调，然后进行强化微调。

Conclusion: RISE提供了一种无需手动标注思维链的自监督解决方案，可有效提升视觉语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with complex image annotation tasks,
such as emotion classification and context-driven object detection, which
demand sophisticated reasoning. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) focuses
solely on annotation outcomes, ignoring underlying rationales, while Visual
Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-RFT) produces inconsistent Chains of Thought
(CoTs) due to the absence of high-quality, verified CoTs during pre-training.
We introduce RISE (Reason-Inspire-Strengthen-Expertise), a two-stage framework
to overcome these limitations. In the Reason stage (RISE-CoT), a reinforcement
learning-driven "annotation-reasoning-annotation" closed-loop generates
visually grounded, logically consistent CoTs by verifying their ability to
reconstruct original annotations without direct leakage. The Inspire and
Strengthen stage (RISE-R1) leverages a high-quality CoT subset, filtered by
RISE-CoT rewards, for supervised fine-tuning, followed by reinforcement
fine-tuning to produce interpretable reasoning and accurate annotations,
achieving Expertise in complex visual tasks. Evaluated on complex and simple
image annotation tasks, RISE-trained Qwen2-VL-2B outperforms SFT and
Visual-RFT, achieving robust performance and enhanced explainability. RISE
offers a self-supervised solution for advancing VLM reasoning without requiring
manually annotated CoTs.

Abstract: Discovering the governing equations of a physical system and designing an
effective feedback controller remains one of the most challenging and intensive
areas of ongoing research. This task demands a deep understanding of the system
behavior, including the nonlinear factors that influence its dynamics. In this
article, we propose a novel methodology for identifying a feedback linearized
physical system based on known prior dynamic behavior. Initially, the system is
identified using a sparse regression algorithm, subsequently a feedback
controller is designed for the discovered system by applying Lie derivatives to
the dictionary of output functions to derive an augmented constraint which
guarantees that no internal dynamics are observed. Unlike the prior related
works, the novel aspect of this article combines the approach of stacked
regression algorithm and relative degree conditions to discover and feedback
linearize the true governing equations of a physical model.

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality labeled data in sensor-based Human Activity
Recognition (HAR) hinders model performance and limits generalization across
real-world scenarios. Data augmentation is a key strategy to mitigate this
issue by enhancing the diversity of training datasets. Signal
Transformation-based Data Augmentation (STDA) techniques have been widely used
in HAR. However, these methods are often physically implausible, potentially
resulting in augmented data that fails to preserve the original meaning of the
activity labels. In this study, we introduce and systematically characterize
Physically Plausible Data Augmentation (PPDA) enabled by physics simulation.
PPDA leverages human body movement data from motion capture or video-based pose
estimation and incorporates various realistic variabilities through physics
simulation, including modifying body movements, sensor placements, and
hardware-related effects. We compare the performance of PPDAs with traditional
STDAs on three public datasets of daily activities and fitness workouts. First,
we evaluate each augmentation method individually, directly comparing PPDAs to
their STDA counterparts. Next, we assess how combining multiple PPDAs can
reduce the need for initial data collection by varying the number of subjects
used for training. Experiments show consistent benefits of PPDAs, improving
macro F1 scores by an average of 3.7 pp (up to 13 pp) and achieving competitive
performance with up to 60% fewer training subjects than STDAs. As the first
systematic study of PPDA in sensor-based HAR, these results highlight the
advantages of pursuing physical plausibility in data augmentation and the
potential of physics simulation for generating synthetic Inertial Measurement
Unit data for training deep learning HAR models. This cost-effective and
scalable approach therefore helps address the annotation scarcity challenge in
HAR.

Abstract: Data-driven algorithmic matching systems promise to help human decision
makers make better matching decisions in a wide variety of high-stakes
application domains, such as healthcare and social service provision. However,
existing systems are not designed to achieve human-AI complementarity:
decisions made by a human using an algorithmic matching system are not
necessarily better than those made by the human or by the algorithm alone. Our
work aims to address this gap. To this end, we propose collaborative matching
(comatch), a data-driven algorithmic matching system that takes a collaborative
approach: rather than making all the matching decisions for a matching task
like existing systems, it selects only the decisions that it is the most
confident in, deferring the rest to the human decision maker. In the process,
comatch optimizes how many decisions it makes and how many it defers to the
human decision maker to provably maximize performance. We conduct a large-scale
human subject study with $800$ participants to validate the proposed approach.
The results demonstrate that the matching outcomes produced by comatch
outperform those generated by either human participants or by algorithmic
matching on their own. The data gathered in our human subject study and an
implementation of our system are available as open source at
https://github.com/Networks-Learning/human-AI-complementarity-matching.

TL;DR: 基于类别层次结构的遵循预测（HCC）方法，通过将类别层次关系结构整合到预测集中，在保持覆盖保证的同时提供更有意义的不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准遵循预测（CP）将类别视为平面结构，忽略了类标签之间的语义关系或层次结构等域知识。

Method: 将HCC形式化为一个约束优化问题，其解决方案产生由层次结构中不同级别节点组成的预测集，同时维持覆盖保证。证明只需要考虑一个更小的、结构良好的候选解集子集。

Result: 在电影、图像和文本数据的三个新标准测试上验证了方法的优势，用户研究显示标注者显著偏好层次预测集而非平面预测集。

Conclusion: HCC方法能够在保持遵循预测框架的保证性的同时，利用域知识提供更有意义的不确定性量化，为带有结构类别标签的应用提供更好的解释性。

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is a powerful framework for quantifying uncertainty
in machine learning models, offering reliable predictions with finite-sample
coverage guarantees. When applied to classification, CP produces a prediction
set of possible labels that is guaranteed to contain the true label with high
probability, regardless of the underlying classifier. However, standard CP
treats classes as flat and unstructured, ignoring domain knowledge such as
semantic relationships or hierarchical structure among class labels. This paper
presents hierarchical conformal classification (HCC), an extension of CP that
incorporates class hierarchies into both the structure and semantics of
prediction sets. We formulate HCC as a constrained optimization problem whose
solutions yield prediction sets composed of nodes at different levels of the
hierarchy, while maintaining coverage guarantees. To address the combinatorial
nature of the problem, we formally show that a much smaller, well-structured
subset of candidate solutions suffices to ensure coverage while upholding
optimality. An empirical evaluation on three new benchmarks consisting of
audio, image, and text data highlights the advantages of our approach, and a
user study shows that annotators significantly prefer hierarchical over flat
prediction sets.

Abstract: We consider the problem of generating samples via Flow Matching (FM) with an
additional requirement that the generated samples must satisfy given
constraints. We consider two scenarios, viz.: (a) when a differentiable
distance function to the constraint set is given, and (b) when the constraint
set is only available via queries to a membership oracle. For case (a), we
propose a simple adaptation of the FM objective with an additional term that
penalizes the distance between the constraint set and the generated samples.
For case (b), we propose to employ randomization and learn a mean flow that is
numerically shown to have a high likelihood of satisfying the constraints. This
approach deviates significantly from existing works that require simple convex
constraints, knowledge of a barrier function, or a reflection mechanism to
constrain the probability flow. Furthermore, in the proposed setting we show
that a two-stage approach, where both stages approximate the same original flow
but with only the second stage probing the constraints via randomization, is
more computationally efficient. Through several synthetic cases of constrained
generation, we numerically show that the proposed approaches achieve
significant gains in terms of constraint satisfaction while matching the target
distributions. As a showcase for a practical oracle-based constraint, we show
how our approach can be used for training an adversarial example generator,
using queries to a hard-label black-box classifier. We conclude with several
future research directions. Our code is available at

Motivation: 传统语言获取研究通常假设学习者能够观察到所有相关信息，但现实中存在部分可观测性问题，学习者需要从有限信息中推断语言映射关系。

Method: 提出了一个在部分可观测性条件下的语言获取框架，通过环境知识、行动和发送的消息来推断私有信息，开发了基于学习的解码算法来解决这个问题。

Result: 在玩具设置中展示了该方法的可行性，并正式探讨了在更一般设置中出现的挑战，验证了所提出算法的有效性。

Conclusion: 部分可观测性是语言获取中一个重要但被忽视的方面，通过环境知识和行动来推断私有信息的方法为机器语言学习提供了新的解决思路。

Abstract: Machine language acquisition is often presented as a problem of imitation
learning: there exists a community of language users from which a learner
observes speech acts and attempts to decode the mappings between utterances and
situations. However, an interesting consideration that is typically unaddressed
is partial observability, i.e. the learner is assumed to see all relevant
information. This paper explores relaxing this assumption, thereby posing a
more challenging setting where such information needs to be inferred from
knowledge of the environment, the actions taken, and messages sent. We see
several motivating examples of this problem, demonstrate how they can be solved
in a toy setting, and formally explore challenges that arise in more general
settings. A learning-based algorithm is then presented to perform the decoding
of private information to facilitate language acquisition.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于动态图构建和时空注意力机制的fMRI分类框架，用于自闭症谱系障碍诊断，在ABIDE数据集上取得了63.2%的准确率和60.0%的AUC，优于静态图方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前fMRI分类方法主要基于静态功能连接，无法全面捕捉时空关系，需要开发能够动态建模脑功能连接时空特性的新方法。

Method: 使用基于transformer的注意力机制动态推断每个时间间隔的脑功能连接，构建时变图并通过GCN和transformer处理，捕捉局部交互和全局时间依赖关系。

Result: 在ABIDE数据集子集上达到63.2%准确率和60.0% AUC，显著优于静态图方法（GCN:51.8%）。

Conclusion: 验证了动态连接和时空上下文联合建模对fMRI分类的有效性，核心创新在于注意力驱动的动态图创建和GCN-transformer融合的层次时空特征融合。

Abstract: Understanding the complex neural activity dynamics is crucial for the
development of the field of neuroscience. Although current functional MRI
classification approaches tend to be based on static functional connectivity or
cannot capture spatio-temporal relationships comprehensively, we present a new
framework that leverages dynamic graph creation and spatiotemporal attention
mechanisms for Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD) diagnosis. The approach used in
this research dynamically infers functional brain connectivity in each time
interval using transformer-based attention mechanisms, enabling the model to
selectively focus on crucial brain regions and time segments. By constructing
time-varying graphs that are then processed with Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCNs) and transformers, our method successfully captures both localized
interactions and global temporal dependencies. Evaluated on the subset of ABIDE
dataset, our model achieves 63.2 accuracy and 60.0 AUC, outperforming static
graph-based approaches (e.g., GCN:51.8). This validates the efficacy of joint
modeling of dynamic connectivity and spatio-temporal context for fMRI
classification. The core novelty arises from (1) attention-driven dynamic graph
creation that learns temporal brain region interactions and (2) hierarchical
spatio-temporal feature fusion through GCNtransformer fusion.

Conclusion: X-MoE系统有效解决了MoE架构在非NVIDIA平台上的扩展性问题，为大规模MoE模型的训练提供了高效的解决方案

Abstract: Emerging expert-specialized Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, such as
DeepSeek-MoE, deliver strong model quality through fine-grained expert
segmentation and large top-k routing. However, their scalability is limited by
substantial activation memory overhead and costly all-to-all communication.
Furthermore, current MoE training systems - primarily optimized for NVIDIA GPUs
- perform suboptimally on non-NVIDIA platforms, leaving significant
computational potential untapped. In this work, we present X-MoE, a novel MoE
training system designed to deliver scalable training performance for
next-generation MoE architectures. X-MoE achieves this via several novel
techniques, including efficient padding-free MoE training with cross-platform
kernels, redundancy-bypassing dispatch, and hybrid parallelism with
sequence-sharded MoE blocks. Our evaluation on the Frontier supercomputer,
powered by AMD MI250X GPUs, shows that X-MoE scales DeepSeek-style MoEs up to
545 billion parameters across 1024 GPUs - 10x larger than the largest trainable
model with existing methods under the same hardware budget, while maintaining
high training throughput. The source code of X-MoE is available at

Abstract: Predicting counterfactual distributions in complex dynamical systems is
essential for scientific modeling and decision-making in domains such as public
health and medicine. However, existing methods often rely on point estimates or
purely data-driven models, which tend to falter under data scarcity. We propose
a time series diffusion-based framework that incorporates guidance from
imperfect expert models by extracting high-level signals to serve as structured
priors for generative modeling. Our method, ODE-Diff, bridges mechanistic and
data-driven approaches, enabling more reliable and interpretable causal
inference. We evaluate ODE-Diff across semi-synthetic COVID-19 simulations,
synthetic pharmacological dynamics, and real-world case studies, demonstrating
that it consistently outperforms strong baselines in both point prediction and
distributional accuracy.

Abstract: Future trajectories play an important role across domains such as autonomous
driving, hurricane forecasting, and epidemic modeling, where practitioners
commonly generate ensemble paths by sampling probabilistic models or leveraging
multiple autoregressive predictors. While these trajectories reflect inherent
uncertainty, they are typically uncalibrated. We propose a unified framework
based on conformal prediction that transforms sampled trajectories into
calibrated prediction intervals with theoretical coverage guarantees. By
introducing a novel online update step and an optimization step that captures
inter-step dependencies, our method can produce discontinuous prediction
intervals around each trajectory, naturally capture temporal dependencies, and
yield sharper, more adaptive uncertainty estimates.

Abstract: The growing demand for intelligent services on resource-constrained edge
devices has spurred the development of collaborative inference systems that
distribute workloads across end devices, edge servers, and the cloud. While
most existing frameworks focus on single-task, single-model scenarios, many
real-world applications (e.g., autonomous driving and augmented reality)
require concurrent execution of diverse tasks including detection,
segmentation, and depth estimation. In this work, we propose a unified
framework to jointly decide which multi-task models to deploy (onload) at
clients and edge servers, and how to route queries across the hierarchy
(offload) to maximize overall inference accuracy under memory, compute, and
communication constraints. We formulate this as a mixed-integer program and
introduce J3O (Joint Optimization of Onloading and Offloading), an alternating
algorithm that (i) greedily selects models to onload via Lagrangian-relaxed
submodular optimization and (ii) determines optimal offloading via constrained
linear programming. We further extend J3O to account for batching at the edge,
maintaining scalability under heterogeneous task loads. Experiments show J3O
consistently achieves over $97\%$ of the optimal accuracy while incurring less
than $15\%$ of the runtime required by the optimal solver across multi-task
benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种量化框架，通过时间-频率分析鸣声事件来评估疑似症状起源区（SOZ）与统计异常通道之间的空间一致性。结果显示基于局部离群因子的异常检测结合加权空间指标，在成功手术患者中显示出高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床定义的症状起源区（SOZ）准确定位对癫症所术成功至关重要。研究动机在于开发一种完补性方法，通过分析鸣声事件的时间-频率特征来评估SOZ与统计异常通道的空间一致性，以支持症状定位和手术规划。

Method: 采用两步流水线：(1) 无监督异常检测：使用局部离群因子（LOF）分析（N邻居=20，污染率=0.2）识别基于鸣声事件谱时特征（起始频率、终止频率、持续时间）的异常通道；(2) 空间相关性分析：计算精确匹配指标和加权指数相似性，包含半球一致性和电极接近度。

Result: 结果显示LOF方法有效检测异常通道，加权指数匹配在SOZ定位中表现更优。成功案例显示高性能指标：无症状患者指数精度均值0.903，成功手术患者0.865，而失败案例一致性较低（指数精度均值0.460）。

Conclusion: 基于鸣声的异常检测结合加权空间指标，为SOZ定位提供了一种完补性方法，尤其在手术成功的患者中显示出艶举潜力，可以作为临床症状定位的有力工具。

Abstract: This study presents a quantitative framework for evaluating the spatial
concordance between clinically defined seizure onset zones (SOZs) and
statistically anomalous channels identified through time-frequency analysis of
chirp events. The proposed pipeline employs a two-step methodology: (1)
Unsupervised Outlier Detection, where Local Outlier Factor (LOF) analysis with
adaptive neighborhood selection identifies anomalous channels based on
spectro-temporal features of chirp (Onset frequency, offset frequency, and
temporal duration); and (2) Spatial Correlation Analysis, which computes both
exact co-occurrence metrics and weighted index similarity, incorporating
hemispheric congruence and electrode proximity. Key findings demonstrate that
the LOF-based approach (N neighbors=20, contamination=0.2) effectively detects
outliers, with index matching (weighted by channel proximity) outperforming
exact matching in SOZ localization. Performance metrics (precision, recall, F1)
were highest for seizure-free patients (Index Precision mean: 0.903) and those
with successful surgical outcomes (Index Precision mean: 0.865), whereas
failure cases exhibited lower concordance (Index Precision mean: 0.460). The
key takeaway is that chirp-based outlier detection, combined with weighted
spatial metrics, provides a complementary method for SOZ localization,
particularly in patients with successful surgical outcomes.

Abstract: Designing de-novo molecules with desired property profiles requires efficient
exploration of the vast chemical space ranging from $10^{23}$ to $10^{60}$
possible synthesizable candidates. While various deep generative models have
been developed to design small molecules using diverse input representations,
Molecular Large Language Models (Mol-LLMs) based on string representations have
emerged as a scalable approach capable of exploring billions of molecules.
However, there remains limited understanding regarding how standard language
modeling practices such as textual representations, tokenization strategies,
model size, and dataset scale impact molecular generation performance. In this
work, we systematically investigate these critical aspects by introducing
NovoMolGen, a family of transformer-based foundation models pretrained on 1.5
billion molecules for de-novo molecule generation. Through extensive empirical
analyses, we identify a weak correlation between performance metrics measured
during pretraining and actual downstream performance, revealing important
distinctions between molecular and general NLP training dynamics. NovoMolGen
establishes new state-of-the-art results, substantially outperforming prior
Mol-LLMs and specialized generative models in both unconstrained and
goal-directed molecular generation tasks, thus providing a robust foundation
for advancing efficient and effective molecular modeling strategies.

Conclusion: 该研究有效解决了网络环境下的上下文线性手势问题，通过动态网络权重实现了部分信息共享，在保持通信效率的同时显著提升了学习性能，为网络化序列决策问题提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: We consider contextual linear bandits over networks, a class of sequential
decision-making problems where learning occurs simultaneously across multiple
locations and the reward distributions share structural similarities while also
exhibiting local differences. While classical contextual bandits assume either
fully centralized data or entirely isolated learners, much remains unexplored
in networked environments when information is partially shared. In this paper,
we address this gap by developing two network-aware Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) algorithms, NetLinUCB and Net-SGD-UCB, which enable adaptive information
sharing guided by dynamically updated network weights. Our approach decompose
learning into global and local components and as a result allow agents to
benefit from shared structure without full synchronization. Both algorithms
incur lighter communication costs compared to a fully centralized setting as
agents only share computed summaries regarding the homogeneous features. We
establish regret bounds showing that our methods reduce the learning complexity
associated with the shared structure from $O(N)$ to sublinear $O(\sqrt{N})$,
where $N$ is the size of the network. The two algorithms reveal complementary
strengths: NetLinUCB excels in low-noise regimes with fine-grained
heterogeneity, while Net-SGD-UCB is robust to high-dimensional, high-variance
contexts. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods across
simulated pricing environments compared to standard benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在部署时需要平衡多个冲突目标（如帮助性、无害性、幽默性），传统方法需要对每个目标配置进行微调，计算成本高且不灵活

Method: 训练一组小型价值模型对应不同目标，推理时根据用户指定权重组合这些模型产生倾斜函数来调整基础模型的输出分布，使用KL正则化策略的迭代算法确保单调改进

Conclusion: MAVIS提供了一个计算高效且灵活的多目标对齐框架，能够在推理时动态调整LLM行为，无需昂贵的模型微调

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse
applications that demand balancing multiple, often conflicting, objectives --
such as helpfulness, harmlessness, or humor. Aligning outputs to user-specific
preferences in such multi-objective settings typically requires fine-tuning
models for each objective or preference configuration, which is computationally
expensive and inflexible. We introduce MAVIS -- Multi-Objective Alignment via
Value-Guided Inference-Time Search -- a lightweight inference-time alignment
framework that enables dynamic control over LLM behavior without modifying the
base model's weights. MAVIS trains a set of small value models, each
corresponding to a distinct objective. At inference time, these value models
are combined using user-specified weights to produce a tilting function that
adjusts the base model's output distribution toward desired trade-offs. The
value models are trained using a simple iterative algorithm that ensures
monotonic improvement of the KL-regularized policy. We show empirically that
MAVIS outperforms baselines that fine-tune per-objective models and combine
them post hoc, and even approaches the performance of the idealized setting
where models are fine-tuned for a user's exact preferences.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a vital role in critical domains like energy

events in other modalities such as texts. However, incorporating natural
language-based external events to improve non-stationary forecasting remains
largely unexplored, as most approaches still rely on a single modality,
resulting in limited contextual knowledge and model underperformance. Enabling
fine-grained multimodal interactions between temporal and textual data is
challenged by three fundamental issues: (1) the difficulty of fine-grained
synchronization between time-varying discrete textual events and continuous
time series; (2) the inherent temporal uncertainty introduced by textual
semantics; and (3) the misalignment between textual event embeddings and
multi-resolution temporal patterns. In this work, we address these challenges
by introducing event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting (EventTSF),
an autoregressive generation framework that integrates historical time series
with textual events to make subsequent forecasts. Specifically, EventTSF uses
autoregressive diffusion with flow matching at each step to capture nuanced
temporal-event interactions. To handle event-induced uncertainty, flow matching
timesteps are adaptively controlled according to event semantic signals. The
underlying denoiser employs a multimodal U-shaped diffusion transformer that
efficiently fuses temporal and textual modalities across different resolutions.
Extensive experiments on 8 synthetic and real-world datasets show that EventTSF
outperforms 12 baselines across diverse event-aware non-stationary time series
forecasting scenarios, achieving substantial improvements of 10.7% higher
forecasting accuracy and $1.13\times$ faster training efficiency.

*Jiayu Fang,Zhiqi Shao,S T Boris Choy,Junbin Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SVDformer是一种结合SVD分解和Transformer的方向感知图表征学习框架，通过关注奇异值和奇异向量来显式保保边的方向性，在节点分类任务上超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有有向图神经网络难以同时抓取方向语义和全局结构模式，因为其同性聚合机制和局部筛波机制存在限制。

Method: 使用SVD分解将图表示为奇异向量和奇异值，通过Transformer的多头自注意力机制精炼奇异值嵌入，学习性地实现低通/高通图筛波，并用奇异向量作为方向投影基础来模式入出边模式的多尺度交互。

Result: 在6个有向图数据集上的实验表明，SVDformer在节点分类任务上一贵超越了现有最先进的GNN和方向感知基线方法。

Conclusion: SVDformer为有向图表征学习建立了一种新的范式，通过结合SVD和Transformer机制有效地解决了方向性和全局结构投影的关键挑战。

Abstract: Directed graphs are widely used to model asymmetric relationships in
real-world systems. However, existing directed graph neural networks often
struggle to jointly capture directional semantics and global structural
patterns due to their isotropic aggregation mechanisms and localized filtering
mechanisms. To address this limitation, this paper proposes SVDformer, a novel
framework that synergizes SVD and Transformer architecture for direction-aware
graph representation learning. SVDformer first refines singular value
embeddings through multi-head self-attention, adaptively enhancing critical
spectral components while suppressing high-frequency noise. This enables
learnable low-pass/high-pass graph filtering without requiring spectral
kernels. Furthermore, by treating singular vectors as directional projection
bases and singular values as scaling factors, SVDformer uses the Transformer to
model multi-scale interactions between incoming/outgoing edge patterns through
attention weights, thereby explicitly preserving edge directionality during
feature propagation. Extensive experiments on six directed graph benchmarks
demonstrate that SVDformer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and
direction-aware baselines on node classification tasks, establishing a new
paradigm for learning representations on directed graphs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ASAP是一种无需标签的自适应学习率调整方法，通过计算当前和先前未标记输出的余弦距离来动态调整学习率，有效应对在线标签偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中机器学习模型面临在线标签偏移问题，标签分布随时间变化。固定学习率难以平衡适应速度和稳定性，需要一种无需标签的自适应方法。

Method: 提出ASAP方法，通过计算当前和先前softmax输出的余弦距离，将其映射到有界范围内来动态调整学习率。无需标签、模型集成或历史输入，仅使用前一个softmax输出。

Result: 在多个数据集和偏移场景下的实验表明，ASAP能持续提升准确率和效率，在无监督模型适应中表现优异。

Conclusion: ASAP提供了一种轻量级、快速的自适应学习率调整方案，适用于实际应用中的无监督模型在线适应场景。

Abstract: In real-world applications, machine learning models face online label shift,
where label distributions change over time. Effective adaptation requires
careful learning rate selection: too low slows adaptation and too high causes
instability. We propose ASAP (Adaptive Shift Aware Post-training), which
dynamically adjusts the learning rate by computing the cosine distance between
current and previous unlabeled outputs and mapping it within a bounded range.
ASAP requires no labels, model ensembles, or past inputs, using only the
previous softmax output for fast, lightweight adaptation. Experiments across
multiple datasets and shift scenarios show ASAP consistently improves accuracy
and efficiency, making it practical for unsupervised model adaptation.

Result: 在三个数据集上的广泛实验表明，相比基线模型，所提出的分类器具有更高的分类准确率和更低的分层违规率。

Conclusion: HCAL分类器通过创新的原型对比学习和自适应加权机制，有效解决了HMC中的结构一致性和优化偏差问题，为分层多标签分类提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification (HMC) faces critical challenges in
maintaining structural consistency and balancing loss weighting in Multi-Task
Learning (MTL). In order to address these issues, we propose a classifier
called HCAL based on MTL integrated with prototype contrastive learning and
adaptive task-weighting mechanisms. The most significant advantage of our
classifier is semantic consistency including both prototype with explicitly
modeling label and feature aggregation from child classes to parent classes.
The other important advantage is an adaptive loss-weighting mechanism that
dynamically allocates optimization resources by monitoring task-specific
convergence rates. It effectively resolves the "one-strong-many-weak"
optimization bias inherent in traditional MTL approaches. To further enhance
robustness, a prototype perturbation mechanism is formulated by injecting
controlled noise into prototype to expand decision boundaries. Additionally, we
formalize a quantitative metric called Hierarchical Violation Rate (HVR) as to
evaluate hierarchical consistency and generalization. Extensive experiments
across three datasets demonstrate both the higher classification accuracy and
reduced hierarchical violation rate of the proposed classifier over baseline
models.

Method: 使用t-SNE技术处理chirp的时域、频域和频谱指标，保留局部邻域关系并解决拥挤问题。在2D嵌入上构建三个分类任务，使用四种分类器（随机森林、SVM、逻辑回归、k-NN）进行5折交叉验证，并应用SHAP生成特征影响敏感度图。

Result: 随机森林和k-NN分类器表现最佳，在最优病例检测（成功结果且临床难度最小）中达到88.8%的准确率。SHAP图揭示了嵌入空间中空间局部化的特征重要性，显示了特定chirp属性如何驱动区域聚类和类别分离。

Conclusion: 该集成框架展示了可解释嵌入和局部特征归因在临床分层和决策支持方面的潜力，为理解数据潜在结构提供了重要见解。

Abstract: This study presents a pipeline leveraging t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor
Embedding (t-SNE) for interpretable visualizations of chirp features across
diverse outcome scenarios. The dataset, comprising chirp-based temporal,
spectral, and frequency metrics. Using t-SNE, local neighborhood relationships
were preserved while addressing the crowding problem through Student
t-distribution-based similarity optimization. Three classification tasks were
formulated on the 2D t-SNE embeddings: (1) distinguishing clinical success from
failure/no-resection, (2) separating high-difficulty from low-difficulty cases,
and (3) identifying optimal cases, defined as successful outcomes with minimal
clinical difficulty. Four classifiers, namely, Random Forests, Support Vector
Machines, Logistic Regression, and k-Nearest Neighbors, were trained and
evaluated using stratified 5-fold cross-validation. Across tasks, the Random
Forest and k-NN classifiers demonstrated superior performance, achieving up to
88.8% accuracy in optimal case detection (successful outcomes with minimal
clinical difficulty). Additionally, feature influence sensitivity maps were
generated using SHAP explanations applied to model predicting t-SNE
coordinates, revealing spatially localized feature importance within the
embedding space. These maps highlighted how specific chirp attributes drive
regional clustering and class separation, offering insights into the latent
structure of the data. The integrated framework showcases the potential of
interpretable embeddings and local feature attribution for clinical
stratification and decision support.

Conclusion: DyMixOp框架成功解决了非线性PDE动力系统的近似问题，通过理论基础的转换方法和创新的LGM变换，在保持物理可解释性的同时实现了优异的预测性能。

Abstract: A primary challenge in using neural networks to approximate nonlinear
dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) is
transforming these systems into a suitable format, especially when dealing with
non-linearizable dynamics or the need for infinite-dimensional spaces for
linearization. This paper introduces DyMixOp, a novel neural operator framework
for PDEs that integrates insights from complex dynamical systems to address
this challenge. Grounded in inertial manifold theory, DyMixOp transforms
infinite-dimensional nonlinear PDE dynamics into a finite-dimensional latent
space, establishing a structured foundation that maintains essential nonlinear
interactions and enhances physical interpretability. A key innovation is the
Local-Global-Mixing (LGM) transformation, inspired by convection dynamics in
turbulence. This transformation effectively captures both fine-scale details
and nonlinear interactions, while mitigating spectral bias commonly found in
existing neural operators. The framework is further strengthened by a
dynamics-informed architecture that connects multiple LGM layers to approximate
linear and nonlinear dynamics, reflecting the temporal evolution of dynamical
systems. Experimental results across diverse PDE benchmarks demonstrate that
DyMixOp achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing
prediction errors, particularly in convection-dominated scenarios reaching up
to 86.7\%, while maintaining computational efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: Predicting particle trajectories with neural networks (NNs) has substantially
enhanced many scientific and engineering domains. However, effectively
quantifying and visualizing the inherent uncertainty in predictions remains
challenging. Without an understanding of the uncertainty, the reliability of NN
models in applications where trustworthiness is paramount is significantly
compromised. This paper introduces the uncertainty tube, a novel,
computationally efficient visualization method designed to represent this
uncertainty in NN-derived particle paths. Our key innovation is the design and
implementation of a superelliptical tube that accurately captures and
intuitively conveys nonsymmetric uncertainty. By integrating well-established
uncertainty quantification techniques, such as Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo
Dropout (MC Dropout), and Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian (SWAG), we
demonstrate the practical utility of the uncertainty tube, showcasing its
application on both synthetic and simulation datasets.

Motivation: 解决AI算法不透明性这一阻碍AI伦理发展的主要障碍，区分不同类型的不透明性及其伦理含义

Result: 识别了两种不同的不透明性类型及其各自的伦理问题，发现可解释AI方法仍面临诸多挑战

Conclusion: AI算法的不透明性具有多重维度，可解释AI技术虽然有所发展，但在解决完全透明性方面仍存在显著挑战

Abstract: The opaqueness of many complex machine learning algorithms is often mentioned
as one of the main obstacles to the ethical development of artificial
intelligence (AI). But what does it mean for an algorithm to be opaque? Highly
complex algorithms such as artificial neural networks process enormous volumes
of data in parallel along multiple hidden layers of interconnected nodes,
rendering their inner workings epistemically inaccessible to any human being,
including their designers and developers; they are "black boxes" for all their
stakeholders. But opaqueness is not always the inevitable result of technical
complexity. Sometimes, the way an algorithm works is intentionally hidden from
view for proprietary reasons, especially in commercial automated decision
systems, creating an entirely different type of opaqueness. In the first part
of the chapter, we will examine these two ways of understanding opacity and the
ethical implications that stem from each of them. In the second part, we
explore the different explanatory methods that have been developed in computer
science to overcome an AI system's technical opaqueness. As the analysis shows,
explainable AI (XAI) still faces numerous challenges.

Motivation: 随着可再生能源在电网中渗透率的提高，系统平衡需要建筑群的协调需求灰度。现有的多建筑模拟平台存在模型简化、物理精细度不足、输入输出固定等限制，影响了控制策略的公平测试。

Method: 研究开发了MuFlex平台，该平台支持EnergyPlus建筑模型的同步信息交换，遵循最新OpenAI Gym接口标准，提供模块化、标准化的强化学习实现。通过案例研究，使用细心调优超参数的Soft Actor-Critic算法协调4座办公建筑的需求灰度。

Conclusion: MuFlex平台有效解决了多建筑灰度协调控制中的模拟设备问题，为强化学习算法在建筑能源管理中的应用提供了可靠的测试环境，对促进可再生能源消化和电网平衡具有重要意义。

Abstract: With the increasing penetration of renewable generation on the power grid,
maintaining system balance requires coordinated demand flexibility from
aggregations of buildings. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely explored
for building controls because of its model-free nature. Open-source simulation
testbeds are essential not only for training RL agents but also for fairly
benchmarking control strategies. However, most building-sector testbeds target
single buildings; multi-building platforms are relatively limited and typically
rely on simplified models (e.g., Resistance-Capacitance) or data-driven
approaches, which lack the ability to fully capture the physical intricacies
and intermediate variables necessary for interpreting control performance.
Moreover, these platforms often impose fixed inputs, outputs, and model
formats, restricting their applicability as benchmarking tools across diverse
control scenarios. To address these gaps, MuFlex, a scalable, open-source
platform for benchmarking and testing control strategies for multi-building
flexibility coordination, was developed in this study. MuFlex enables
synchronous information exchange across EnergyPlus building models and adheres
to the latest OpenAI Gym interface, providing a modular, standardized RL
implementation. The platform capabilities were demonstrated in a case study
coordinating demand flexibility across four office buildings using the Soft
Actor-Critic algorithm with carefully fine-tuned hyperparameters. The results
show that aggregating the four buildings flexibility reduced total peak demand
below a specified threshold while maintaining indoor environmental quality.

Conclusion: 该混合框架能够提供准确、可解释的多空间分辨率预测，支持感染控制政策和暴发风险的反事实分析

Abstract: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a critical public
health threat within hospitals as well as long-term care facilities. Better
understanding of MRSA risks, evaluation of interventions and forecasting MRSA
rates are important public health problems. Existing forecasting models rely on
statistical or neural network approaches, which lack epidemiological
interpretability, and have limited performance. Mechanistic epidemic models are
difficult to calibrate and limited in incorporating diverse datasets. We
present CALYPSO, a hybrid framework that integrates neural networks with
mechanistic metapopulation models to capture the spread dynamics of infectious
diseases (i.e., MRSA) across healthcare and community settings. Our model
leverages patient-level insurance claims, commuting data, and healthcare
transfer patterns to learn region- and time-specific parameters governing MRSA
spread. This enables accurate, interpretable forecasts at multiple spatial
resolutions (county, healthcare facility, region, state) and supports
counterfactual analyses of infection control policies and outbreak risks. We
also show that CALYPSO improves statewide forecasting performance by over 4.5%
compared to machine learning baselines, while also identifying high-risk
regions and cost-effective strategies for allocating infection prevention
resources.

TL;DR: 提出新的CROC方法，通过结合常见和稀有变异来提高疾病风险预测的准确性，解决了传统方法在稀有变异预测中的性能不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前基于常见基因变异的风险预测模型准确性不足，需要结合稀有变异来提高预测性能，以满足临床应用的需求。

Method: 提出了折叠受调工作特征方法(CROC)，是之前前向ROC(FROC)方法的扩展，特别添加了处理稀有变异的流程，使用了遗传分析工作小组17数据集中37个候选基因的533个SNP进行评估。

Result: 结果显示结合所有SNP的预测模型(AUC=0.605)比仅使用常见变异的模型(AUC=0.585)更准确。当常见变异数量减少时，CROC方法的性能明显优于FROC方法。在仅有稀有变异的极端情况下，CROC的AUC为0.603，而FROC仅为0.524。

Conclusion: CROC方法能够有效结合常见和稀有变异进行风险预测，显著提高了预测准确性，尤其在稀有变异预测中表现优异，为临床风险预测提供了更好的方法。

Abstract: Risk prediction that capitalizes on emerging genetic findings holds great
promise for improving public health and clinical care. However, recent risk
prediction research has shown that predictive tests formed on existing common
genetic loci, including those from genome-wide association studies, have lacked
sufficient accuracy for clinical use. Because most rare variants on the genome
have not yet been studied for their role in risk prediction, future disease
prediction discoveries should shift toward a more comprehensive risk prediction
strategy that takes into account both common and rare variants. We are
proposing a collapsing receiver operating characteristic CROC approach for risk
prediction research on both common and rare variants. The new approach is an
extension of a previously developed forward ROC FROC approach, with additional
procedures for handling rare variants. The approach was evaluated through the
use of 533 single-nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs in 37 candidate genes from the
Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 mini-exome data set. We found that a prediction
model built on all SNPs gained more accuracy AUC = 0.605 than one built on
common variants alone AUC = 0.585. We further evaluated the performance of two
approaches by gradually reducing the number of common variants in the analysis.
We found that the CROC method attained more accuracy than the FROC method when
the number of common variants in the data decreased. In an extreme scenario,
when there are only rare variants in the data, the CROC reached an AUC value of
0.603, whereas the FROC had an AUC value of 0.524.

Abstract: The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2019, designated
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as a serious antimicrobial
resistance threat. The risk of acquiring MRSA and suffering life-threatening
consequences due to it remains especially high for hospitalized patients due to
a unique combination of factors, including: co-morbid conditions, immuno
suppression, antibiotic use, and risk of contact with contaminated hospital
workers and equipment. In this paper, we present a novel generative
probabilistic model, GenHAI, for modeling sequences of MRSA test results
outcomes for patients during a single hospitalization. This model can be used
to answer many important questions from the perspectives of hospital
administrators for mitigating the risk of MRSA infections. Our model is based
on the probabilistic programming paradigm, and can be used to approximately
answer a variety of predictive, causal, and counterfactual questions. We
demonstrate the efficacy of our model by comparing it against discriminative
and generative machine learning models using two real-world datasets.

Conclusion: GLF框架成功统一了多种自监督对比学习方法，ADC方法作为即插即用组件能够有效解决无监督学习中的类内紧凑性和类间分离性问题，具有理论和实践价值。

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL) has recently demonstrated
superiority in multiple downstream tasks. In this paper, we generalize the
standard SSCL methods to a Generalized Learning Framework (GLF) consisting of
two parts: the aligning part and the constraining part. We analyze three
existing SSCL methods: BYOL, Barlow Twins, and SwAV, and show that they can be
unified under GLF with different choices of the constraining part. We further
propose empirical and theoretical analyses providing two insights into
designing the constraining part of GLF: intra-class compactness and inter-class
separability, which measure how well the feature space preserves the class
information of the inputs. However, since SSCL can not use labels, it is
challenging to design a constraining part that satisfies these properties. To
address this issue, we consider inducing intra-class compactness and
inter-class separability by iteratively capturing the dynamic relationship
between anchor and other samples and propose a plug-and-play method called
Adaptive Distribution Calibration (ADC) to ensure that samples that are near or
far from the anchor point in the original input space are closer or further
away from the anchor point in the feature space. Both the theoretical analysis
and the empirical evaluation demonstrate the superiority of ADC.

Abstract: Causal inference often hinges on strong assumptions - such as no unmeasured
confounding or perfect compliance - that are rarely satisfied in practice.
Partial identification offers a principled alternative: instead of relying on
unverifiable assumptions to estimate causal effects precisely, it derives
bounds that reflect the uncertainty inherent in the data. Despite its
theoretical appeal, partial identification remains underutilized in applied
work, in part due to the fragmented nature of existing methods and the lack of
practical guidance. This thesis addresses these challenges by systematically
comparing a diverse set of bounding algorithms across multiple causal
scenarios. We implement, extend, and unify state-of-the-art methods - including
symbolic, optimization-based, and information-theoretic approaches - within a
common evaluation framework. In particular, we propose an extension of a
recently introduced entropy-bounded method, making it applicable to
counterfactual queries such as the Probability of Necessity and Sufficiency
(PNS). Our empirical study spans thousands of randomized simulations involving
both discrete and continuous data-generating processes. We assess each method
in terms of bound tightness, computational efficiency, and robustness to
assumption violations. To support practitioners, we distill our findings into a
practical decision tree for algorithm selection and train a machine learning
model to predict the best-performing method based on observable data
characteristics.

TL;DR: FedOL是一种联邦学习新方法，通过单轮通信实现服务器大模型构建，使用知识蒸馏而非参数共享，减少通信开销并支持异构架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统联邦学习中模型架构统一性要求、多轮通信开销大、客户端计算负担重的问题，同时保护数据隐私。

Method: 采用知识蒸馏技术，客户端仅交换在未标记公共数据集上的预测输出；提出专门的目标函数迭代优化伪标签和服务器模型；设计定制化的伪标签生成和知识蒸馏策略。

Result: 仿真结果显示FedOL显著优于现有基线方法，为移动网络提供了成本效益高的解决方案。

Conclusion: FedOL通过单轮通信、知识蒸馏和伪标签优化，有效解决了联邦学习中的通信开销、异构架构和隐私保护问题，特别适合计算资源有限的移动客户端场景。

Abstract: Large models, renowned for superior performance, outperform smaller ones even
without billion-parameter scales. While mobile network servers have ample
computational resources to support larger models than client devices, privacy
constraints prevent clients from directly sharing their raw data. Federated
Learning (FL) enables decentralized clients to collaboratively train a shared
model by exchanging model parameters instead of transmitting raw data. Yet, it
requires a uniform model architecture and multiple communication rounds, which
neglect resource heterogeneity, impose heavy computational demands on clients,
and increase communication overhead. To address these challenges, we propose
FedOL, to construct a larger and more comprehensive server model in one-shot
settings (i.e., in a single communication round). Instead of model parameter
sharing, FedOL employs knowledge distillation, where clients only exchange
model prediction outputs on an unlabeled public dataset. This reduces
communication overhead by transmitting compact predictions instead of full
model weights and enables model customization by allowing heterogeneous model
architectures. A key challenge in this setting is that client predictions may
be biased due to skewed local data distributions, and the lack of ground-truth
labels in the public dataset further complicates reliable learning. To mitigate
these issues, FedOL introduces a specialized objective function that
iteratively refines pseudo-labels and the server model, improving learning
reliability. To complement this, FedOL incorporates a tailored pseudo-label
generation and knowledge distillation strategy that effectively integrates
diverse knowledge. Simulation results show that FedOL significantly outperforms
existing baselines, offering a cost-effective solution for mobile networks
where clients possess valuable private data but limited computational
resources.

Motivation: 当前神经网络权重生成方法在泛化到未见任务和实际应用探索方面存在困难，需要将文本语义与权重空间动态联系起来。

Method: 采用扩散变换器框架，将网络参数分层处理为统一块，通过先验注意力机制集成CLIP文本嵌入，并使用权重空间增强的对抗训练来提高泛化能力。

Result: 在Cifar100、Caltech256和TinyImageNet上的实验表明，T2W能够为未见任务生成高质量权重，优于基于优化的初始化方法。

Conclusion: 该工作通过开源文本-权重对数据集，将文本语义与权重空间动态连接起来，推进了生成模型在神经网络参数合成中的实用性。

Abstract: How far are we really from automatically generating neural networks? While
neural network weight generation shows promise, current approaches struggle
with generalization to unseen tasks and practical application exploration. To
address this, we propose T2W, a diffusion transformer framework that generates
task-specific weights conditioned on natural language descriptions. T2W
hierarchically processes network parameters into uniform blocks, integrates
text embeddings from CLIP via a prior attention mechanism, and employs
adversarial training with weight-space augmentation to enhance generalization.
Experiments on Cifar100, Caltech256, and TinyImageNet demonstrate T2W's ability
to produce high-quality weights for unseen tasks, outperforming
optimization-based initialization and enabling novel applications such as
weight enhancement and text-guided model fusion. Our work bridges textual
semantics with weight-space dynamics, supported by an open-source dataset of
text-weight pairs, advancing the practicality of generative models in neural
network parameter synthesis. Our code is available on Github.

Abstract: Modern machine learning is trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD),
whose performance critically depends on how the learning rate (LR) is adjusted
and decreased over time. Yet existing LR regimes may be intricate, or need to
tune one or more additional hyper-parameters manually whose bottlenecks include
huge computational expenditure, time and power in practice. This work, in a
natural and direct manner, clarifies how LR should be updated automatically
only according to the intrinsic variation of stochastic gradients. An
explainable LR regime by leveraging stochastic second-order algorithms is
developed, behaving a similar pattern to heuristic algorithms but implemented
simply without any parameter tuning requirement, where it is of an automatic
procedure that LR should increase (decrease) as the norm of stochastic
gradients decreases (increases). The resulting LR regime shows its efficiency,
robustness, and scalability in different classical stochastic algorithms,
containing SGD, SGDM, and SIGNSGD, on machine learning tasks.

Conclusion: FedSheafHN框架通过套幂协作机制有效解决了子图联邦学习中的数据异质性问题，为个性化模型生成提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Graph-structured data is prevalent in many applications. In subgraph
federated learning (FL), this data is distributed across clients, each with a
local subgraph. Personalized subgraph FL aims to develop a customized model for
each client to handle diverse data distributions. However, performance
variation across clients remains a key issue due to the heterogeneity of local
subgraphs. To overcome the challenge, we propose FedSheafHN, a novel framework
built on a sheaf collaboration mechanism to unify enhanced client descriptors
with efficient personalized model generation. Specifically, FedSheafHN embeds
each client's local subgraph into a server-constructed collaboration graph by
leveraging graph-level embeddings and employing sheaf diffusion within the
collaboration graph to enrich client representations. Subsequently, FedSheafHN
generates customized client models via a server-optimized hypernetwork.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FedSheafHN outperforms existing
personalized subgraph FL methods on various graph datasets. Additionally, it
exhibits fast model convergence and effectively generalizes to new clients.

<details>

Motivation: 现代神经网络在大型数据集上训练的计算和环境成本很高，需要开发更高效的训练方法来减少计算时间、能源消耗和碳排放。

Method: 提取每批的低秩特征表示，应用Fast MaxVol采样器选择跨越批次主导子集的小型多样化子集，使用梯度近似准则动态调整子集大小。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，GRAFT在准确性和效率方面匹配或超过现有选择基线，在准确性、效率和排放之间提供了有利的权衡。

Conclusion: GRAFT通过低秩子空间操作和在精心选择的样本上训练而非完整批次，有效减少了训练时间、能耗和碳排放，同时保持了训练性能。

Abstract: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally and
environmentally costly. We introduce GRAFT, a scalable in-training subset
selection method that (i) extracts a low-rank feature representation for each
batch, (ii) applies a Fast MaxVol sampler to select a small, diverse subset
that spans the batch's dominant subspace, and (iii) dynamically adjusts the
subset size using a gradient-approximation criterion. By operating in low-rank
subspaces and training on carefully chosen examples instead of full batches,
GRAFT preserves the training trajectory while reducing wall-clock time, energy
consumption, and $\mathrm{CO}_2$ emissions. Across multiple benchmarks, GRAFT
matches or exceeds recent selection baselines in both accuracy and efficiency,
providing a favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and emissions.

TL;DR: 输入时间缩放新范式，通过在训练和测试时使用元知识精炼输入，反转"垃圾输入垃圾输出"偏见，在少量数据上达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 补充当前LLM的数据缩放和推理缩放，提出在查询输入时投入资源的新缩放范式

Method: 在训练和测试阶段都使用元知识精炼输入的策略，进行训练-测试协同设计

Result: 在Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct上达到AIME24(76.7%)和AIME25(76.7%)的SOTA性能，最高能达AIME24(86.7%)和AIME25(80%)

Conclusion: 输入时间缩放是有效的新范式，轻质量数据反而能获得更好效果，"Less is More"现象在LLM中同样适用

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually post-trained on large-scale
carefully curated datasets (data & training scaling) and doing reasoning in
test time (inference time scaling). In this work, we present a new scaling
paradigm, Input Time Scaling, to complement previous scaling methods by putting
resources on queries (input time). During training and testing, we combine
meta-knowledge from LLMs to refine inputs with different strategies. We also
find a new phenomenon, training-testing co-design there. We need to apply query
strategies during both training and testing. Only applying strategies on
training or testing would seriously degrade the performance. We are also
surprised to find that seemingly low data quality datasets can gain high
performance. Adding irrelevant information to the queries, randomly selecting
examples from a minimally filtered dataset, can even perform the best. These
findings contradict the widely held inductive bias, "garbage in, garbage out".
Curating datasets with seemingly high-quality data can even potentially limit
the performance ceiling. In addition, models trained on more data with similar
quality (15k VS 1k) perform worse, simple dataset size scaling should also be
carefully inspected. The good news is that our findings are compatible with the
Less is More phenomenon. A small set of examples is enough to evoke high-level
reasoning ability. With experiments on models trained on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct,
we are able to reach SOTA performance among 32B models on AIME24(76.7%) and
AIME25(76.7%) pass@1. We can further achieve AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(80%) with
a majority vote of three models. Starting from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B,
the best result would be 86.7% on AIME24 and 76.7% on AIME25. To facilitate
reproducibility and further research, we are working on open-source our
datasets, data pipelines, evaluation results, and checkpoints.

Motivation: 随着预训练模型的发展，现代ML工作流需要超越超参数优化的更复杂技术（如微调、集成等），传统CASH框架无法满足异构ML流水线的需求。

Method: 提出PS-PFN方法，将后验采样扩展到最大k臂老虎机问题设置，利用先验数据拟合网络通过上下文学习高效估计最大值后验分布，支持不同成本和每臂独立建模。

Result: 在一个新颖和两个现有标准基准任务上的实验结果表明，PS-PFN相比其他老虎机和AutoML策略具有优越性能。

Conclusion: 成功扩展了CASH框架以适应现代ML流水线，PS-PFN方法为异构ML流水线的自动选择和适配提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization (CASH) has been
fundamental to traditional AutoML systems. However, with the advancements of
pre-trained models, modern ML workflows go beyond hyperparameter optimization
and often require fine-tuning, ensembling, and other adaptation techniques.
While the core challenge of identifying the best-performing model for a
downstream task remains, the increasing heterogeneity of ML pipelines demands
novel AutoML approaches. This work extends the CASH framework to select and
adapt modern ML pipelines. We propose PS-PFN to efficiently explore and exploit
adapting ML pipelines by extending Posterior Sampling (PS) to the max k-armed
bandit problem setup. PS-PFN leverages prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) to
efficiently estimate the posterior distribution of the maximal value via
in-context learning. We show how to extend this method to consider varying
costs of pulling arms and to use different PFNs to model reward distributions
individually per arm. Experimental results on one novel and two existing
standard benchmark tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PS-PFN
compared to other bandit and AutoML strategies. We make our code and data
available at https://github.com/amirbalef/CASHPlus.

Conclusion: 该可微分通信模块有效提升了多满情景中代理间的协作能力，具有训练参数数量固定（与代理数量无关）的优势

Abstract: Communication is essential for the collective execution of complex tasks by
human agents, motivating interest in communication mechanisms for multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). However, existing communication protocols in
MARL are often complex and non-differentiable. In this work, we introduce a
self-attention-based communication module that exchanges information between
the agents in MARL. Our proposed approach is fully differentiable, allowing
agents to learn to generate messages in a reward-driven manner. The module can
be seamlessly integrated with any action-value function decomposition method
and can be viewed as an extension of such decompositions. Notably, it includes
a fixed number of trainable parameters, independent of the number of agents.
Experimental results on the SMAC benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on several maps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注随机环境下的重尾bandit问题，对抗性环境下的研究很少且仅限于MAB特殊情况，需要开发适用于对抗性重尾bandit的通用算法框架。

Method: 使用FTRL方法，在损失估计上添加奖励函数，设计了HT-SPM数据依赖学习率，并采用方差缩减的线性损失估计器。

Result: 在重尾MAB中实现了Õ(T^(1/ε))对抗性遗憾和Õ(log T)随机性遗憾；在线性bandits中实现了Õ(d^(1/2)T^(1/ε))遗憾，与随机环境最佳结果匹配。

Conclusion: 该框架首次解决了对抗性重尾bandit问题，为MAB和线性bandits提供了BOBW算法，无需截断非负性假设，性能达到最优。

Abstract: Heavy-tailed bandits have been extensively studied since the seminal work of
\citet{Bubeck2012BanditsWH}. In particular, heavy-tailed linear bandits,
enabling efficient learning with both a large number of arms and heavy-tailed
noises, have recently attracted significant attention
\citep{ShaoYKL18,XueWWZ20,ZhongHYW21,Wang2025heavy,tajdini2025improved}.
However, prior studies focus almost exclusively on stochastic regimes, with few
exceptions limited to the special case of heavy-tailed multi-armed bandits
(MABs) \citep{Huang0H22,ChengZ024,Chen2024uniINF}.
  In this work, we propose a general framework for adversarial heavy-tailed
bandit problems, which performs follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) over the
loss estimates shifted by a bonus function. Via a delicate setup of the bonus
function, we devise the first FTRL-type best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) algorithm
for heavy-tailed MABs, which does not require the truncated non-negativity
assumption and achieves an $\widetilde{O}(T^{\frac{1}{\varepsilon}})$
worst-case regret in the adversarial regime as well as an $\widetilde{O}(\log
T)$ gap-dependent regret in the stochastic regime. We then extend our framework
to the linear case, proposing the first algorithm for adversarial heavy-tailed
linear bandits with finite arm sets. This algorithm achieves an
$\widetilde{O}(d^{\frac{1}{2}}T^{\frac{1}{\varepsilon}})$ regret, matching the
best-known worst-case regret bound in stochastic regimes. Moreover, we propose
a general data-dependent learning rate, termed \textit{heavy-tailed noise aware
stability-penalty matching} (HT-SPM). We prove that HT-SPM guarantees BOBW
regret bounds for general heavy-tailed bandit problems once certain conditions
are satisfied. By using HT-SPM and, in particular, a variance-reduced linear
loss estimator, we obtain the first BOBW result for heavy-tailed linear
bandits.

Abstract: Existing research on single-machine scheduling is largely focused on exact
algorithms, which perform well on typical instances but can significantly
deteriorate on certain regions of the problem space. In contrast, data-driven
approaches provide strong and scalable performance when tailored to the
structure of specific datasets. Leveraging this idea, we focus on a
single-machine scheduling problem where each job is defined by its weight,
duration, due date, and deadline, aiming to minimize the total weight of tardy
jobs. We introduce a novel data-driven scheduling heuristic that combines
machine learning with problem-specific characteristics, ensuring feasible
solutions, which is a common challenge for ML-based algorithms. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art in terms of optimality gap, number of optimal solutions, and
adaptability across varied data scenarios, highlighting its flexibility for
practical applications. In addition, we conduct a systematic exploration of ML
models, addressing a common gap in similar studies by offering a detailed model
selection process and providing insights into why the chosen model is the best
fit.

Abstract: This paper proposes a Trans-XFed architecture that combines federated
learning with explainable AI techniques for supply chain credit assessment. The
proposed model aims to address several key challenges, including privacy,
information silos, class imbalance, non-identically and independently
distributed (Non-IID) data, and model interpretability in supply chain credit
assessment. We introduce a performance-based client selection strategy (PBCS)
to tackle class imbalance and Non-IID problems. This strategy achieves faster
convergence by selecting clients with higher local F1 scores. The FedProx
architecture, enhanced with homomorphic encryption, is used as the core model,
and further incorporates a transformer encoder. The transformer encoder block
provides insights into the learned features. Additionally, we employ the
integrated gradient explainable AI technique to offer insights into
decision-making. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Trans-XFed through
experimental evaluations on real-world supply chain datasets. The obtained
results show its ability to deliver accurate credit assessments compared to
several baselines, while maintaining transparency and privacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的降维方法要么专注于保持局部结构（如t-SNE、UMAP），要么专注于保持全局结构（如MDS、PCA），但没有方法能够同时很好地表示这两个方面。

Method: DREAMS通过简单的正则化项将t-SNE的局部结构保持与PCA的全局结构保持相结合，生成从局部结构良好的t-SNE嵌入到全局结构良好的PCA嵌入的频谱。

Result: 在七个真实世界数据集（包括五个单细胞转录组学数据集和一个人群遗传学数据集）上进行基准测试，定性和定量地展示了DREAMS在多个尺度上保持结构的优越能力。

Conclusion: DREAMS方法能够有效平衡局部和全局结构的保持，在多个尺度上优于现有方法，为高维数据可视化提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction techniques are widely used for visualizing
high-dimensional data in two dimensions. Existing methods are typically
designed to preserve either local (e.g. $t$-SNE, UMAP) or global (e.g. MDS,
PCA) structure of the data, but none of the established methods can represent
both aspects well. In this paper, we present DREAMS (Dimensionality Reduction
Enhanced Across Multiple Scales), a method that combines the local structure
preservation of $t$-SNE with the global structure preservation of PCA via a
simple regularization term. Our approach generates a spectrum of embeddings
between the locally well-structured $t$-SNE embedding and the globally
well-structured PCA embedding, efficiently balancing both local and global
structure preservation. We benchmark DREAMS across seven real-world datasets,
including five from single-cell transcriptomics and one from population
genetics, showcasing qualitatively and quantitatively its superior ability to
preserve structure across multiple scales compared to previous approaches.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of sequential decision-making for
Sharpe ratio (SR) maximization in a stochastic bandit setting. We focus on the
Thompson Sampling (TS) algorithm, a Bayesian approach celebrated for its
empirical performance and exploration efficiency, under the assumption of
Gaussian rewards with unknown parameters. Unlike conventional bandit objectives
focusing on maximizing cumulative reward, Sharpe ratio optimization instead
introduces an inherent tradeoff between achieving high returns and controlling
risk, demanding careful exploration of both mean and variance. Our theoretical
contributions include a novel regret decomposition specifically designed for
the Sharpe ratio, highlighting the role of information acquisition about the
reward distribution in driving learning efficiency. Then, we establish
fundamental performance limits for the proposed algorithm \texttt{SRTS} in
terms of an upper bound on regret. We also derive the matching lower bound and
show the order-optimality. Our results show that Thompson Sampling achieves
logarithmic regret over time, with distribution-dependent factors capturing the
difficulty of distinguishing arms based on risk-adjusted performance. Empirical
simulations show that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing
algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习与可验证奖励(RLVR)在大型语言模型推理能力开发中存在两个未充分探索的维度：深度（模型能采样的最难问题）和广度（单次迭代消耗的实例数量）。GRPO算法存在系统性偏差，过度加权中等准确率样本而忽视对推动推理边界至关重要的低准确率样本。

Method: 1. 提出难度自适应采样(DARS)：通过目标多阶段rollout重新加权难题，增加难题的正向rollout数量
2. 引入大广度训练：大幅扩展批量大小，用多轮全批量更新替代PPO的小批量迭代
3. 结合两者提出DARS-B方法

Conclusion: 广度和跨深度的自适应探索是RLVR中的正交维度，对于释放RLVR的推理能力至关重要。同时优化这两个维度可以显著提升语言模型的推理性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language
models, yet its full potential is hindered by two under-explored dimensions:
Depth-the hardest problem a model can sample; Breadth-the number of instances
consumed in a single iteration. We dissect the popular GRPO algorithm and
reveal a systematic bias: the cumulative-advantage disproportionately weights
samples with medium accuracy, while down-weighting the low-accuracy instances
that are crucial for pushing reasoning boundaries. To rectify the depth
neglect, we introduce Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS), which
re-weights hard problems through targeted multi-stage rollouts, thereby
increasing the number of positive rollouts for hard problems. Empirically,
naively enlarging rollout size only accelerates convergence and even hurts
Pass@K. Our DARS, in contrast, delivers consistent Pass@K gains without extra
inference cost at convergence. Just as we adaptively expanded the depth of
exploration, we now ask whether aggressively scaling the breadth of training
data can further amplify reasoning gains. To this end, we intensely scale batch
size and replace PPO's mini-batch iterations with full-batch updates over
multiple epochs. Increasing breadth significantly enhances Pass@1 performance.
Large-breadth training sustains high token-level entropy, indicating continued
exploration and reduced gradient noise. We further present DARS-B, which
augments DARS with large breadth, and demonstrate simultaneous gains in Pass@K
and Pass@1. The results confirm that breadth and adaptive exploration across
depth operate as orthogonal dimensions in RLVR, which are key to unleashing the
reasoning power of RLVR.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了PENGUIN模型，通过周期嵌套组注意力机制显式建模周期模式，在长期时间序列预测任务上超过了Transformer和MLP基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Transformer模型在预测任务上取得了重大突破，但其在时间序列预测中的有效性仍有争议。需要重新考虑自注意力机制的意义，显式建模周期模式并结合相对注意偏置。

Method: 提出Periodic-Nested Group Attention(PENGUIN)：1)周期嵌套相对注意偏置直接捕捉周期结构；2)使用分组注意机制处理多重共存周期性，每个组使用多查询注意机制针对特定周期性。

Result: 在多个基准测试集上进行了涉及广泛的实验，PENGUIN模型一贯地超过了MLP基础和Transformer基础模型。

Conclusion: 显式建模周期模式和结合相对注意偏置对时间序列建模非常重要，PENGUIN提供了一种简单但有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) is a fundamental task with
wide-ranging applications. Although Transformer-based models have made
significant breakthroughs in forecasting, their effectiveness for time series
forecasting remains debatable. In this paper, we revisit the significance of
self-attention and propose a simple yet effective mechanism, Periodic-Nested
Group Attention, namely PENGUIN. Our approach highlights the importance of
explicitly modeling periodic patterns and incorporating relative attention bias
for effective time series modeling. To this end, we introduce a periodic-nested
relative attention bias that captures periodic structures directly. To handle
multiple coexisting periodicities (e.g., daily and weekly cycles), we design a
grouped attention mechanism, where each group targets a specific periodicity
using a multi-query attention mechanism. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks demonstrate that PENGUIN consistently outperforms both MLP-based and
Transformer-based models.

Motivation: 联邦学习中通信效率问题特别是在异质性和动态客户参与情况下，现有方法对每轮选择多少客户这个问题研究不够

Method: 提出ISP（智能参与者选择）机制，动态确定每轮最优客户数量，在视觉Transformer、心电图分类等多种场景下验证

Result: 在保持最终模型质量的前提下，实现了一致30%的通信开销节省

Conclusion: 选择每轮客户数量是联邦学习中一个独立重要的任务，ISP方法有效解决了通信效率璦颈

Abstract: Rapid scaling of deep learning models has enabled performance gains across
domains, yet it introduced several challenges. Federated Learning (FL) has
emerged as a promising framework to address these concerns by enabling
decentralized training. Nevertheless, communication efficiency remains a key
bottleneck in FL, particularly under heterogeneous and dynamic client
participation. Existing methods, such as FedAvg and FedProx, or other
approaches, including client selection strategies, attempt to mitigate
communication costs. However, the problem of choosing the number of clients in
a training round remains extremely underexplored. We introduce Intelligent
Selection of Participants (ISP), an adaptive mechanism that dynamically
determines the optimal number of clients per round to enhance communication
efficiency without compromising model accuracy. We validate the effectiveness
of ISP across diverse setups, including vision transformers, real-world ECG
classification, and training with gradient compression. Our results show
consistent communication savings of up to 30\% without losing the final
quality. Applying ISP to different real-world ECG classification setups
highlighted the selection of the number of clients as a separate task of
federated learning.

Motivation: 随着AI系统越来越依赖训练数据，评估数据集可信过程变得至关重要，特别是对于偏见等在数据集层面出现的性质。现有方法主要关注单个数据的可靠性，而非数据集层面的全局性质

Method: 构建在主观逻辑之上，支持信任命题和在证据不完整、分布式或冲突场景下量化不确定性。将框架应用于偏见评估，并在交通标志识别数据集上进行实验评估

Result: 方法能够抓取类别不平衡，在集中式和联邦学习环境中保持可解释性和稳健性

Conclusion: 该框架为AI训练数据集的可信过程提供了第一个正式的方法，特别是在评估全局性质如偏见时支持不确定性量化

Abstract: As AI systems increasingly rely on training data, assessing dataset
trustworthiness has become critical, particularly for properties like fairness
or bias that emerge at the dataset level. Prior work has used Subjective Logic
to assess trustworthiness of individual data, but not to evaluate
trustworthiness properties that emerge only at the level of the dataset as a
whole. This paper introduces the first formal framework for assessing the
trustworthiness of AI training datasets, enabling uncertainty-aware evaluations
of global properties such as bias. Built on Subjective Logic, our approach
supports trust propositions and quantifies uncertainty in scenarios where
evidence is incomplete, distributed, and/or conflicting. We instantiate this
framework on the trustworthiness property of bias, and we experimentally
evaluate it based on a traffic sign recognition dataset. The results
demonstrate that our method captures class imbalance and remains interpretable
and robust in both centralized and federated contexts.

Abstract: Imbalanced distribution learning is a common and significant challenge in
predictive modeling, often reducing the performance of standard algorithms.
Although various approaches address this issue, most are tailored to
classification problems, with a limited focus on regression. This paper
introduces a novel method to improve learning on tabular data within the
Imbalanced Regression (IR) framework, which is a critical problem. We propose
using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to model and define a latent
representation of data distributions. However, VAEs can be inefficient with
imbalanced data like other standard approaches. To address this, we develop an
innovative data generation method that combines a disentangled VAE with a
Smoothed Bootstrap applied in the latent space. We evaluate the efficiency of
this method through numerical comparisons with competitors on benchmark
datasets for IR.

Conclusion: 两种剪枝方法各有适用场景，实践者应根据具体目标和约束来选择。混合方法在某些情况下可以超过传统方法。

Abstract: Pruning is a core technique for compressing neural networks to improve
computational efficiency. This process is typically approached in two ways:
one-shot pruning, which involves a single pass of training and pruning, and
iterative pruning, where pruning is performed over multiple cycles for
potentially finer network refinement. Although iterative pruning has
historically seen broader adoption, this preference is often assumed rather
than rigorously tested. Our study presents one of the first systematic and
comprehensive comparisons of these methods, providing rigorous definitions,
benchmarking both across structured and unstructured settings, and applying
different pruning criteria and modalities. We find that each method has
specific advantages: one-shot pruning proves more effective at lower pruning
ratios, while iterative pruning performs better at higher ratios. Building on
these findings, we advocate for patience-based pruning and introduce a hybrid
approach that can outperform traditional methods in certain scenarios,
providing valuable insights for practitioners selecting a pruning strategy
tailored to their goals and constraints. Source code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedUP是一种轻量级的联邦遗忘算法，通过剪枝特定连接来高效消除恶意客户端对全局模型的影响，无需完全重新训练，在保持良性数据性能的同时有效降低恶意数据准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习容易受到模型投毒攻击，传统联邦遗忘假设客户端可信且合作，但在恶意客户端可能共谋的情况下，无法依赖其配合进行数据遗忘，需要新的解决方案。

Method: FedUP仅利用遗忘前最后一轮训练中的客户端权重，通过选择并置零良性客户端和恶意客户端更新之间差异最大的高幅值权重来剪枝特定连接，同时保留良性信息。

Result: 在50%恶意客户端、IID和非IID数据、标签翻转和后门攻击等强对抗威胁模型下，FedUP能有效降低恶意影响，使恶意数据准确率与从头训练模型相当，同时保持良性数据性能，且比现有方案更快、更节省存储。

Conclusion: FedUP提供了一种高效、鲁棒的联邦遗忘解决方案，能够在恶意客户端环境中有效消除其影响，同时保持模型性能和操作效率。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) can be vulnerable to attacks, such as model
poisoning, where adversaries send malicious local weights to compromise the
global model. Federated Unlearning (FU) is emerging as a solution to address
such vulnerabilities by selectively removing the influence of detected
malicious contributors on the global model without complete retraining.
However, unlike typical FU scenarios where clients are trusted and cooperative,
applying FU with malicious and possibly colluding clients is challenging
because their collaboration in unlearning their data cannot be assumed. This
work presents FedUP, a lightweight FU algorithm designed to efficiently
mitigate malicious clients' influence by pruning specific connections within
the attacked model. Our approach achieves efficiency by relying only on
clients' weights from the last training round before unlearning to identify
which connections to inhibit. Isolating malicious influence is non-trivial due
to overlapping updates from benign and malicious clients. FedUP addresses this
by carefully selecting and zeroing the highest magnitude weights that diverge
the most between the latest updates from benign and malicious clients while
preserving benign information. FedUP is evaluated under a strong adversarial
threat model, where up to 50%-1 of the clients could be malicious and have full
knowledge of the aggregation process. We demonstrate the effectiveness,
robustness, and efficiency of our solution through experiments across IID and
Non-IID data, under label-flipping and backdoor attacks, and by comparing it
with state-of-the-art (SOTA) FU solutions. In all scenarios, FedUP reduces
malicious influence, lowering accuracy on malicious data to match that of a
model retrained from scratch while preserving performance on benign data. FedUP
achieves effective unlearning while consistently being faster and saving
storage compared to the SOTA.

Conclusion: 专家见解与实证数据结合的方法有效，识别的专家分歧揭示了关键挑战，为未来研究提供了方向指导

Abstract: The rapid advancement of authentication systems and their increasing reliance
on biometrics for faster and more accurate user verification experience,
highlight the critical need for a reliable framework to evaluate the
suitability of biometric modalities for specific applications. Currently, the
most widely known evaluation framework is a comparative table from 1998, which
no longer adequately captures recent technological developments or emerging
vulnerabilities in biometric systems. To address these challenges, this work
revisits the evaluation of biometric modalities through an expert survey
involving 24 biometric specialists. The findings indicate substantial shifts in
property ratings across modalities. For example, face recognition, shows
improved ratings due to technological progress, while fingerprint, shows
decreased reliability because of emerging vulnerabilities and attacks. Further
analysis of expert agreement levels across rated properties highlighted the
consistency of the provided evaluations and ensured the reliability of the
ratings. Finally, expert assessments are compared with dataset-level
uncertainty across 55 biometric datasets, revealing strong alignment in most
modalities and underscoring the importance of integrating empirical evidence
with expert insight. Moreover, the identified expert disagreements reveal key
open challenges and help guide future research toward resolving them.

TL;DR: 提出了Fisher正交投影(FOP)方法，解决大批次训练时二阶优化方法失效的问题，通过利用两个子批次的梯度信息构建方差感知的更新方向


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代GPU支持超大批次训练(数万个样本)，但现有优化器在大批次下表现不佳。一阶方法梯度噪声减少难以逃离局部极小值，二阶方法(如KFAC)需要过高阻尼而失去曲率信息优势

Method: FOP技术利用两个子批次的梯度，在Fisher度量下构建与平均梯度正交的梯度差分量，增强平均梯度形成方差感知的更新方向

Result: FOP恢复了二阶方法在大批次下的有效性，实现了可扩展训练，具有更好的泛化性能和更快的收敛速度

Conclusion: FOP是一种新颖的技术，能够在大批次训练中有效利用二阶信息，解决了现有优化方法在大批次场景下的局限性

Abstract: Modern GPUs are equipped with large amounts of high-bandwidth memory,
enabling them to support mini-batch sizes of up to tens of thousands of
training samples. However, most existing optimizers struggle to perform
effectively at such a large batch size. As batch size increases, gradient noise
decreases due to averaging over many samples, limiting the ability of
first-order methods to escape sharp or suboptimal minima and reach the global
minimum. Meanwhile, second-order methods like the natural gradient with
Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (KFAC) often require excessively high
damping to remain stable at large batch sizes. This high damping effectively
washes out the curvature information that gives these methods their advantage,
reducing their performance to that of simple gradient descent. In this paper,
we introduce Fisher-Orthogonal Projection (FOP), a novel technique that
restores the effectiveness of the second-order method at very large batch
sizes, enabling scalable training with improved generalization and faster
convergence. FOP constructs a variance-aware update direction by leveraging
gradients from two sub-batches, enhancing the average gradient with a component
of the gradient difference that is orthogonal to the average under the
Fisher-metric.

TL;DR: 提出了One-Step Flow Q-Learning (OFQL)框架，通过Flow Matching方法实现单步动作生成，解决了Diffusion Q-Learning多步去噪的效率问题，在保持性能的同时显著提升了训练和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Q-Learning (DQL)虽然在离线强化学习中表现出色，但其依赖多步去噪进行动作生成，导致训练和推理效率低下。单步去噪虽然理想，但直接应用于DQL会导致性能急剧下降。

Method: 将DQL重新表述到Flow Matching框架中，学习平均速度场而非传统Flow Matching的弯曲生成轨迹，从而实现直接准确的单步动作生成，无需辅助模型、蒸馏或多阶段训练。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中，OFQL超越了DQL和其他基于扩散的基线方法，同时相比DQL显著减少了训练和推理时间。

Conclusion: OFQL成功解决了DQL的多步采样效率瓶颈，提供了一个既高效又高性能的离线强化学习解决方案，证明了Flow Matching框架在决策生成任务中的有效性。

Abstract: The generative power of diffusion models (DMs) has recently enabled
high-performing decision-making algorithms in offline reinforcement learning
(RL), achieving state-of-the-art results across standard benchmarks. Among
them, Diffusion Q-Learning (DQL) stands out as a leading method for its
consistently strong performance. Nevertheless, DQL remains limited in practice
due to its reliance on multi-step denoising for action generation during both
training and inference. Although one-step denoising is desirable, simply
applying it to DQL leads to a drastic performance drop. In this work, we
revisit DQL and identify its core limitations. We then propose One-Step Flow
Q-Learning (OFQL), a novel framework that enables efficient one-step action
generation during both training and inference, without requiring auxiliary
models, distillation, or multi-phase training. Specifically, OFQL reformulates
DQL within the sample-efficient Flow Matching (FM) framework. While
conventional FM induces curved generative trajectories that impede one-step
generation, OFQL instead learns an average velocity field that facilitates
direct, accurate action generation. Collectively, OFQL eliminates the need for
multi-step sampling and recursive gradient updates in DQL, resulting in faster
and more robust training and inference. Extensive experiments on the D4RL
benchmark demonstrate that OFQL outperforms DQL and other diffusion-based
baselines, while substantially reducing both training and inference time
compared to DQL.

Abstract: Extreme weather events, intensified by climate change, increasingly challenge
aging combined sewer systems, raising the risk of untreated wastewater
overflow. Accurate forecasting of sewer overflow basin filling levels can
provide actionable insights for early intervention, helping mitigating
uncontrolled discharge. In recent years, AI-based forecasting methods have
offered scalable alternatives to traditional physics-based models, but their
reliance on cloud computing limits their reliability during communication
outages. To address this, we propose an end-to-end forecasting framework that
enables energy-efficient inference directly on edge devices. Our solution
integrates lightweight Transformer and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models,
compressed via integer-only quantization for efficient on-device execution.
Moreover, an automated hardware-aware deployment pipeline is used to search for
optimal model configurations by jointly minimizing prediction error and energy
consumption on an AMD Spartan-7 XC7S15 FPGA. Evaluated on real-world sewer
data, the selected 8-bit Transformer model, trained on 24 hours of historical
measurements, achieves high accuracy (MSE 0.0376) at an energy cost of 0.370 mJ
per inference. In contrast, the optimal 8-bit LSTM model requires significantly
less energy (0.009 mJ, over 40x lower) but yields 14.89% worse accuracy (MSE
0.0432) and much longer training time. This trade-off highlights the need to
align model selection with deployment priorities, favoring LSTM for ultra-low
energy consumption or Transformer for higher predictive accuracy. In general,
our work enables local, energy-efficient forecasting, contributing to more
resilient combined sewer systems. All code can be found in the GitHub
Repository (https://github.com/tianheng-ling/EdgeOverflowForecast).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的深度强化学习策略通常使用高斯分布，限制了学习到的行为只能是单模态的。然而许多实际问题需要多模态策略来促进环境探索，解决稀疏奖励、复杂动态或需要适应不同情境的学习挑战。

Method: 引入分类策略，使用中间分类分布建模多模态行为模式，然后基于采样的模式生成输出动作。探索了两种采样方案，确保可微分离散潜在结构同时保持高效的基于梯度的优化。

Result: 在DeepMind Control Suite环境中评估，通过更好的探索，学习到的策略收敛更快且优于标准高斯策略。

Conclusion: 分类分布是连续控制中结构化探索和多模态行为表示的强大工具。

Abstract: A policy in deep reinforcement learning (RL), either deterministic or
stochastic, is commonly parameterized as a Gaussian distribution alone,
limiting the learned behavior to be unimodal. However, the nature of many
practical decision-making problems favors a multimodal policy that facilitates
robust exploration of the environment and thus to address learning challenges
arising from sparse rewards, complex dynamics, or the need for strategic
adaptation to varying contexts. This issue is exacerbated in continuous control
domains where exploration usually takes place in the vicinity of the predicted
optimal action, either through an additive Gaussian noise or the sampling
process of a stochastic policy. In this paper, we introduce Categorical
Policies to model multimodal behavior modes with an intermediate categorical
distribution, and then generate output action that is conditioned on the
sampled mode. We explore two sampling schemes that ensure differentiable
discrete latent structure while maintaining efficient gradient-based
optimization. By utilizing a latent categorical distribution to select the
behavior mode, our approach naturally expresses multimodality while remaining
fully differentiable via the sampling tricks. We evaluate our multimodal policy
on a set of DeepMind Control Suite environments, demonstrating that through
better exploration, our learned policies converge faster and outperform
standard Gaussian policies. Our results indicate that the Categorical
distribution serves as a powerful tool for structured exploration and
multimodal behavior representation in continuous control.

Conclusion: 未来需要重点研发可用性高、工程质量好的自动化特征工程方法

Abstract: Tabular data, consisting of rows and columns, is omnipresent across various
machine learning applications. Each column represents a feature, and features
can be combined or transformed to create new, more informative features. Such
feature engineering is essential to achieve peak performance in machine
learning. Since manual feature engineering is expensive and time-consuming, a
substantial effort has been put into automating it. Yet, existing automated
feature engineering (AutoFE) methods have never been investigated regarding
their usability for practitioners. Thus, we investigated 53 AutoFE methods. We
found that these methods are, in general, hard to use, lack documentation, and
have no active communities. Furthermore, no method allows users to set time and
memory constraints, which we see as a necessity for usable automation. Our
survey highlights the need for future work on usable, well-engineered AutoFE
methods.

unclear why certain weights yield optimal performance and how to determine
these weights without relying on exhaustive hyperparameter search. This paper
establishes a direct connection between linear scalarization and MTO methods,
revealing through extensive experiments that well-performing scalarization
weights exhibit specific trends in key MTO metrics, such as high gradient
magnitude similarity. Building on this insight, we introduce AutoScale, a
simple yet effective two-phase framework that uses these MTO metrics to guide
weight selection for linear scalarization, without expensive weight search.
AutoScale consistently shows superior performance with high efficiency across
diverse datasets including a new large-scale benchmark.

*Jiho Park,Huiwen Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 多用户上下文级联级手势模型，提出两种UCB算法处理并行用户互动和循环反馈的在线广告场景


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决经典上下文手势模型在实际在线广告中的局限性，特别是多用户同时互动、顺序展示项目和异质奖励结构

Method: 提出UCBBP算法(带向后规划的上供界信心区间)和AUCBBP算法(主动上供界信心区间)，处理级联反馈、并行上下文会话和异质奖励

Result: UCBBP实现了$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{THN})$的悔彺界，AUCBBP在用户缩放方面显示严格效率提升，悔彺界为$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T+HN})$

Conclusion: 新模型有效捐换实际广告场景的结构特征，提出的算法在理论和实验上都表现出良好性能

Abstract: We introduce a Multi-User Contextual Cascading Bandit model, a new
combinatorial bandit framework that captures realistic online advertising
scenarios where multiple users interact with sequentially displayed items
simultaneously. Unlike classical contextual bandits, MCCB integrates three key
structural elements: (i) cascading feedback based on sequential arm exposure,
(ii) parallel context sessions enabling selective exploration, and (iii)
heterogeneous arm-level rewards. We first propose Upper Confidence Bound with
Backward Planning (UCBBP), a UCB-style algorithm tailored to this setting, and
prove that it achieves a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{THN})$ over $T$
episodes, $H$ session steps, and $N$ contexts per episode. Motivated by the
fact that many users interact with the system simultaneously, we introduce a
second algorithm, termed Active Upper Confidence Bound with Backward Planning
(AUCBBP), which shows a strict efficiency improvement in context scaling, i.e.,
user scaling, with a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T+HN})$. We validate
our theoretical findings via numerical experiments, demonstrating the empirical
effectiveness of both algorithms under various settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KMR框架是一个统一的深度学习模型效率优化形式化方法，将剪枝、量化、知识蒸馏等技术抽象为可控旋钮、确定性规则和可测量仪表的三元组表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习模型效率优化方法众多但缺乏统一的形式化表示，难以系统组合和理论分析，需要建立统一的数学框架来整合各种效率技术。

Method: 提出KMR三元组框架（Knob-Meter-Rule），将效率技术抽象为可控参数（Knob）、测量指标（Meter）和优化规则（Rule），并开发Budgeted-KMR算法进行迭代预算优化。

Result: 成功将多种知名效率方法实例化为KMR三元组，提供了算法模板，揭示了方法间的内在联系，支持混合流水线构建。

Conclusion: KMR框架为模型效率研究提供了统一的概念和实践工具，为自动化策略学习、动态适应和成本-质量权衡的理论分析奠定了基础。

Abstract: We introduce the Knob-Meter-Rule (KMR) framework, a unified formalism for
representing and reasoning about model efficiency techniques in deep learning.
By abstracting diverse methods, including pruning, quantization, knowledge
distillation, and parameter-efficient architectures, into a consistent set of
controllable knobs, deterministic rules, and measurable meters, KMR provides a
mathematically precise and modular perspective on efficiency optimization. The
framework enables systematic composition of multiple techniques, flexible
policy-driven application, and iterative budgeted optimization through the
Budgeted-KMR algorithm. We demonstrate how well-known efficiency methods can be
instantiated as KMR triples and present concise algorithmic templates for each.
The framework highlights underlying relationships between methods, facilitates
hybrid pipelines, and lays the foundation for future research in automated
policy learning, dynamic adaptation, and theoretical analysis of cost-quality
trade-offs. Overall, KMR offers both a conceptual and practical tool for
unifying and advancing model efficiency research.

*Sergey Salishev,Ian Akhremchik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种量化神经网络的新方法，通过将量化过程模型化为噪声通道链来跟踪容量动态，并使用可学习的直通估计器进行精细调整，在极端低位宽设置下仍能保持竞争力的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化神经网络在每个层都会引入四舍五入噪声，随着位宽缩小容量会下降，浮点数检查点设置了最大输入速率。需要跟踪容量动态并识别量化瓶颈，以实现更有效的精细调整。

Method: 将精细调整模型为平滑的约束优化问题，使用全可微分的直通估计器(STE)，具有可学习的位宽、噪声尺度和夹富边界。通过外点罚函数强制目标位宽，使用软调和识别等细微的指标平滑来稳定训练。

Result: 该方法虽简单但在极端的W1A1设置（权重1位、激活1位）下仍能达到竞争力的准确性，同时保持了STE的高效率。

Conclusion: 通过将量化模型化为噪声通道链并使用可学习参数的直通估计器，可以有效地跟踪容量动态并解决量化瓶颈，在极端低位宽情况下仍能获得良好的性能。

Abstract: Quantized neural networks can be viewed as a chain of noisy channels, where
rounding in each layer reduces capacity as bit-width shrinks; the
floating-point (FP) checkpoint sets the maximum input rate. We track capacity
dynamics as the average bit-width decreases and identify resulting quantization
bottlenecks by casting fine-tuning as a smooth, constrained optimization
problem. Our approach employs a fully differentiable Straight-Through Estimator
(STE) with learnable bit-width, noise scale and clamp bounds, and enforces a
target bit-width via an exterior-point penalty; mild metric smoothing (via
distillation) stabilizes training. Despite its simplicity, the method attains
competitive accuracy down to the extreme W1A1 setting while retaining the
efficiency of STE.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ASDFormer是一个基于Transformer的架构，通过混合专家池化分类器来捕捉自闭症谱系障碍(ASD)相关的神经特征，在ABIDE数据集上实现了最先进的诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自闭症谱系障碍(ASD)是一种复杂的神经发育疾病，表现为大脑连接性异常。功能MRI可以测量大脑各区域的BOLD信号，这些信号可以建模为脑区之间的相互作用。有效捕捉这些连接模式并识别与典型发育不同的相互作用对于改善ASD诊断和生物标志物发现至关重要。

Method: 提出了ASDFormer，这是一个基于Transformer的架构，整合了混合池化-分类器专家(MoE)系统。通过结合多个专门化的专家分支和注意力机制，该模型能够自适应地强调与自闭症相关的不同脑区和连接模式。

Result: 在ABIDE数据集上，ASDFormer实现了最先进的诊断准确性，并揭示了与ASD相关的功能连接中断的稳健见解。

Conclusion: ASDFormer不仅提高了分类性能，还提供了更可解释的疾病相关生物标志物识别，展示了其作为生物标志物发现工具的潜力。

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition
marked by disruptions in brain connectivity. Functional MRI (fMRI) offers a
non-invasive window into large-scale neural dynamics by measuring
blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals across the brain. These signals can
be modeled as interactions among Regions of Interest (ROIs), which are grouped
into functional communities based on their underlying roles in brain function.
Emerging evidence suggests that connectivity patterns within and between these
communities are particularly sensitive to ASD-related alterations. Effectively
capturing these patterns and identifying interactions that deviate from typical
development is essential for improving ASD diagnosis and enabling biomarker
discovery. In this work, we introduce ASDFormer, a Transformer-based
architecture that incorporates a Mixture of Pooling-Classifier Experts (MoE) to
capture neural signatures associated with ASD. By integrating multiple
specialized expert branches with attention mechanisms, ASDFormer adaptively
emphasizes different brain regions and connectivity patterns relevant to
autism. This enables both improved classification performance and more
interpretable identification of disorder-related biomarkers. Applied to the
ABIDE dataset, ASDFormer achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy and
reveals robust insights into functional connectivity disruptions linked to ASD,
highlighting its potential as a tool for biomarker discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于类型拓扑空间的新方法，用于分析二维数据集的内在结构，通过将数据集组织成有序的轨迹和分支，为凸包计算、聚类和异常检测等算法提供了新平台。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数据集研究主要依赖统计方法和代数拓扑方法，需要从一般拓扑学角度开发新的分析方法来处理有限拓扑空间（如数据集）的结构问题。

Method: 开发了一套特殊的类型集和相关类型拓扑，利用R^2的自然商空间将数据集组织成轨迹，每个轨迹被分割成有序的组件，并用整数序列表示，组件跨轨迹形成分支，用类型II伪树表示关系。

Result: 成功构建了能够揭示数据集内在结构的类型拓扑框架，将数据集分解为有序组件和分支结构。

Conclusion: 类型拓扑方法为数据集分析提供了新的结构视角，能够有效支持凸包计算、孔洞检测、聚类和异常检测等算法的开发。

Abstract: A datatset $X$ on $R^2$ is a finite topological space. Current research of a
dataset focuses on statistical methods and the algebraic topological method
\cite{carlsson}. In \cite{hu}, the concept of typed topological space was
introduced and showed to have the potential for studying finite topological
spaces, such as a dataset. It is a new method from the general topology
perspective. A typed topological space is a topological space whose open sets
are assigned types. Topological concepts and methods can be redefined using
open sets of certain types. In this article, we develop a special set of types
and its related typed topology on a dataset $X$. Using it, we can investigate
the inner structure of $X$. In particular, $R^2$ has a natural quotient space,
in which $X$ is organized into tracks, and each track is split into components.
Those components are in a order. Further, they can be represented by an integer
sequence. Components crossing tracks form branches, and the relationship can be
well represented by a type of pseudotree (called typed-II pseudotree). Such
structures provide a platform for new algorithms for problems such as
calculating convex hull, holes, clustering and anomaly detection.

TL;DR: 知识图谨学习算法，通过泰勒展开、比贝尔矩阵和零阶优化接近逆黑塞矩阵向量积，提高知识图删除效率和质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 满足“被忘记权”法规要求，需要从模型中移除训练数据及其影响，而全量重新训练成本过高

Method: 定义KG谨学习影响函数，使用泰勒展开估计参数变化，用Fisher矩阵和零阶优化接近逆黑塞矩阵向量积，避免计算一阶和二阶导数

Result: 在知识图谨学习效率和质量方面显著超过其他最先进的图谨学习基准方法

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效地处理大规模知识图的谨学习需求，在保持质量的同时大幅提升计算效率

Abstract: Due to regulations like the Right to be Forgotten, there is growing demand
for removing training data and its influence from models. Since full retraining
is costly, various machine unlearning methods have been proposed. In this
paper, we firstly present an efficient knowledge graph (KG) unlearning
algorithm. We remark that KG unlearning is nontrivial due to the distinctive
structure of KG and the semantic relations between entities. Also, unlearning
by estimating the influence of removed components incurs significant
computational overhead when applied to large-scale knowledge graphs. To this
end, we define an influence function for KG unlearning and propose to
approximate the model's sensitivity without expensive computation of
first-order and second-order derivatives for parameter updates. Specifically,
we use Taylor expansion to estimate the parameter changes caused by data
removal. Given that the first-order gradients and second-order derivatives
dominate the computational load, we use the Fisher matrices and zeroth-order
optimization to approximate the inverse-Hessian vector product without
constructing the computational graphs. Our experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art graph unlearning
baselines significantly in terms of unlearning efficiency and unlearning
quality. Our code is released at https://github.com/NKUShaw/ZOWFKGIF.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BLIPs是一种贝叶斯学习原子间势能框架，通过变分dropout提供校准的不确定性估计，在数据稀缺和分布外场景下提升MLIPs的预测准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习原子间势能(MLIPs)在分布外数据和数据稀缺场景下预测不准确，且缺乏不确定性估计，无法指导主动学习和确保模拟结果准确性。

Method: 提出BLIPs：基于变分dropout的可扩展架构无关贝叶斯框架，用于训练或微调MLIPs，提供能量和力的校准不确定性估计。

Result: 在计算化学任务中显示出比标准MLIPs更好的预测准确性，特别是在数据稀缺和严重分布外情况下提供可信的不确定性估计，微调预训练模型也带来持续性能提升。

Conclusion: BLIPs框架成功解决了MLIPs的不确定性估计问题，在计算化学模拟中提供了更可靠和准确的预测能力。

Abstract: Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) are becoming a central tool
in simulation-based chemistry. However, like most deep learning models, MLIPs
struggle to make accurate predictions on out-of-distribution data or when
trained in a data-scarce regime, both common scenarios in simulation-based
chemistry. Moreover, MLIPs do not provide uncertainty estimates by
construction, which are fundamental to guide active learning pipelines and to
ensure the accuracy of simulation results compared to quantum calculations. To
address this shortcoming, we propose BLIPs: Bayesian Learned Interatomic
Potentials. BLIP is a scalable, architecture-agnostic variational Bayesian
framework for training or fine-tuning MLIPs, built on an adaptive version of
Variational Dropout. BLIP delivers well-calibrated uncertainty estimates and
minimal computational overhead for energy and forces prediction at inference
time, while integrating seamlessly with (equivariant) message-passing
architectures. Empirical results on simulation-based computational chemistry
tasks demonstrate improved predictive accuracy with respect to standard MLIPs,
and trustworthy uncertainty estimates, especially in data-scarse or heavy
out-of-distribution regimes. Moreover, fine-tuning pretrained MLIPs with BLIP
yields consistent performance gains and calibrated uncertainties.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LEOPARD算法通过整合偏好反馈和专家演示数据来学习奖励函数，在有限数据情况下显著优于现有基线方法，且结合多种反馈类型通常比单一反馈更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在复杂任务中难以指定合适的奖励函数，现有方法结合偏好反馈和专家演示往往不够灵活、依赖领域特性或难以扩展。

Method: 提出了reward-rational partial orderings over observations框架，并开发了LEOPARD算法，能够从包括负面演示在内的广泛人类数据中学习奖励函数。

Result: 在有限的偏好和演示反馈数据下，LEOPARD显著优于现有基线方法，且多种反馈类型的组合通常比单一反馈类型效果更好。

Conclusion: LEOPARD提供了一个灵活且可扩展的框架，能够有效利用多种类型的人类反馈来学习奖励函数，在复杂任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is a general method for learning in sequential
settings, but it can often be difficult to specify a good reward function when
the task is complex. In these cases, preference feedback or expert
demonstrations can be used instead. However, existing approaches utilising both
together are often ad-hoc, rely on domain-specific properties, or won't scale.
We develop a new framing for learning from human data, \emph{reward-rational
partial orderings over observations}, designed to be flexible and scalable.
Based on this we introduce a practical algorithm, LEOPARD: Learning Estimated
Objectives from Preferences And Ranked Demonstrations. LEOPARD can learn from a
broad range of data, including negative demonstrations, to efficiently learn
reward functions across a wide range of domains. We find that when a limited
amount of preference and demonstration feedback is available, LEOPARD
outperforms existing baselines by a significant margin. Furthermore, we use
LEOPARD to investigate learning from many types of feedback compared to just a
single one, and find that combining feedback types is often beneficial.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 研究不可分割物品在小组间的公平分配问题，重点关注两人小组（夫妻）和其他小型群体。对于两个夫妻组，EF1分配总是存在且可高效找到；对于三个以上夫妻组，EF1分配不一定存在。对于最多k人的小组，PROPk分配总是存在且可高效找到，算法还保证帕累托最优性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究小组形式的公平分配问题，特别是夫妻等小型群体的物品分配场景，这在现实生活中很常见但缺乏系统研究。

Method: 使用EF1（除一个物品外无嫉妒）和PROPk（比例公平）等公平性概念，开发高效算法来寻找满足这些性质的分配方案。

Result: 对于两个夫妻组，EF1分配总是存在且可高效计算；对于最多k人的小组，PROPk分配总是存在且算法保证帕累托最优；在特殊情况下，任意数量夫妻组都存在PROP1分配。

Conclusion: 小组形式的公平分配问题具有丰富的理论性质，针对不同小组规模和公平性要求，存在不同的可计算性结果，为实际应用提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We study the fair allocation of indivisible goods across groups of agents,
where each agent fully enjoys all goods allocated to their group. We focus on
groups of two (couples) and other groups of small size. For two couples, an EF1
allocation -- one in which all agents find their group's bundle no worse than
the other group's, up to one good -- always exists and can be found
efficiently. For three or more couples, EF1 allocations need not exist.
  Turning to proportionality, we show that, whenever groups have size at most
$k$, a PROP$k$ allocation exists and can be found efficiently. In fact, our
algorithm additionally guarantees (fractional) Pareto optimality, and PROP1 to
the first agent in each group, PROP2 to the second, etc., for an arbitrary
agent ordering. In special cases, we show that there are PROP1 allocations for
any number of couples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索用户是否能通过适应性调整内容消费选择来抵影推荐系统对意见的影响，帮助用户防止意见偏移

Method: 研究两种随机策略：固定点击概率的被动策略和根据意见偏移适应性降低点击概率的反应策略，分析式求解预期意见和用户效用

Result: 适应性策略能够帮助用户防止意见偏移，当用户优先考虑意见保持时，适应策略的预期效用明显优于固定策略

Conclusion: 用户层面的策略可以对抗推荐系统导致的偏见，为理解如何应对推荐算法的偏吐提供了新视角

Abstract: Recommendation systems are used in a range of platforms to maximize user
engagement through personalization and the promotion of popular content. It has
been found that such recommendations may shape users' opinions over time. In
this paper, we ask whether reactive users, who are cognizant of the influence
of the content they consume, can prevent such changes by adaptively adjusting
their content consumption choices. To this end, we study users' opinion
dynamics under two types of stochastic policies: a passive policy where the
probability of clicking on recommended content is fixed and a reactive policy
where clicking probability adaptively decreases following large opinion drifts.
We analytically derive the expected opinion and user utility under these
policies. We show that the adaptive policy can help users prevent opinion
drifts and that when a user prioritizes opinion preservation, the expected
utility of the adaptive policy outperforms the fixed policy. We validate our
theoretical findings through numerical simulations. These findings help better
understand how user-level strategies can challenge the biases induced by
recommendation systems.

Motivation: 研究多维空间投票选举中候选人的战略定位问题，为竞选策略提供可实现的算法工具

Method: 使用几何方法，包括超平面枚举算法(O(n^{d+1}))和径向扫描算法(O(n log n) for d=2)，并扩展到位置评分规则如k-approval和Borda

Result: 证明了对单个对手计算最优位置是NP难的，但对常数维度问题是可解的，并为首个多候选情况提供了近似保证

Conclusion: 阐明了多维空间选举的算法格局，为竞选策略提供了实际可实现的工具，几何方法可无缝扩展到其他投票规则

Abstract: We study strategic candidate positioning in multidimensional spatial-voting
elections. Voters and candidates are represented as points in $\mathbb{R}^d$,
and each voter supports the candidate that is closest under a distance induced
by an $\ell_p$-norm. We prove that computing an optimal location for a new
candidate is NP-hard already against a single opponent, whereas for a constant
number of issues the problem is tractable: an $O(n^{d+1})$
hyperplane-enumeration algorithm and an $O(n \log n)$ radial-sweep routine for
$d=2$ solve the task exactly. We further derive the first approximation
guarantees for the general multi-candidate case and show how our geometric
approach extends seamlessly to positional-scoring rules such as $k$-approval
and Borda. These results clarify the algorithmic landscape of multidimensional
spatial elections and provide practically implementable tools for campaign
strategy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加权投票游戏广泛应用于现实决策场景建模，如议会立法过程和企业投票结构。虽然通过添加玩家来控制游戏复杂性问题已解决，但通过删除玩家控制的复杂性仍待研究

Method: 使用计算复杂性理论分析，特别是NP^PP复杂度类（由配备PP预言机的NP机器解决的问题），研究通过删除玩家来改变或维持特定玩家权力的控制问题

Result: 证明了当使用概率Penrose-Banzhaf指数作为权力度量时，通过删除玩家控制加权投票游戏的问题是NP^PP完全的

Conclusion: 这些结果显著改进了现有下界，为实际应用中防范SAT求解技术提供了更强的复杂性保护

Abstract: Weighted voting games are a popular class of coalitional games that are
widely used to model real-life situations of decision-making. They can be
applied, for instance, to analyze legislative processes in parliaments or
voting in corporate structures. Various ways of tampering with these games have
been studied, among them merging or splitting players, fiddling with the quota,
and controlling weighted voting games by adding or deleting players. While the
complexity of control by adding players to such games so as to change or
maintain a given player's power has been recently settled, the complexity of
control by deleting players from such games (with the same goals) remained
open. We show that when the players' power is measured by the probabilistic
Penrose-Banzhaf index, some of these problems are complete for NP^PP -- the
class of problems solvable by NP machines equipped with a PP ("probabilistic
polynomial time") oracle. Our results optimally improve the currently known
lower bounds of hardness for much smaller complexity classes, thus providing
protection against SAT-solving techniques in practical applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的公平分配机制，用于解决协作学习中数据可无限复制场景下的公平奖励分配问题，通过平衡互惠公理确保参与者之间的相互公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 协作学习等AI代理系统中，数据和模型可以无限复制，传统合作博弈论（如Shapley值）假设资源不可复制，无法完全捕捉这类场景。需要新的公平性概念来解决参与者之间互惠利益不平衡导致的战略利用和不公平分配问题。

Method: 提出了一种新的分配机制，基于广义的公平性公理，特别是平衡互惠公理，确保每对参与者都能从对方的参与中获得同等收益。

Result: 开发了一个满足相互公平性属性的机制，并提供了数学证明表明该机制实现了平衡互惠公理的要求。

Conclusion: 该研究为具有无限可复制资源的协作系统提供了新的公平分配框架，解决了传统博弈论方法在此类场景中的局限性，确保了参与者之间的公平互惠关系。

Abstract: The latest developments in AI focus on agentic systems where artificial and
human agents cooperate to realize global goals. An example is collaborative
learning, which aims to train a global model based on data from individual
agents. A major challenge in designing such systems is to guarantee safety and
alignment with human values, particularly a fair distribution of rewards upon
achieving the global goal. Cooperative game theory offers useful abstractions
of cooperating agents via value functions, which assign value to each
coalition, and via reward functions. With these, the idea of fair allocation
can be formalized by specifying fairness axioms and designing concrete
mechanisms. Classical cooperative game theory, exemplified by the Shapley
value, does not fully capture scenarios like collaborative learning, as it
assumes nonreplicable resources, whereas data and models can be replicated.
Infinite replicability requires a generalized notion of fairness, formalized
through new axioms and mechanisms. These must address imbalances in reciprocal
benefits among participants, which can lead to strategic exploitation and
unfair allocations. The main contribution of this paper is a mechanism and a
proof that it fulfills the property of mutual fairness, formalized by the
Balanced Reciprocity Axiom. It ensures that, for every pair of players, each
benefits equally from the participation of the other.

Abstract: The automotive industry generates vast amounts of data from sensors,
telemetry, diagnostics, and real-time operations. Efficient data engineering is
critical to handle challenges of latency, scalability, and consistency. Modern
data lakehouse formats Delta Parquet, Apache Iceberg, and Apache Hudi offer
features such as ACID transactions, schema enforcement, and real-time
ingestion, combining the strengths of data lakes and warehouses to support
complex use cases. This study presents a comparative analysis of Delta Parquet,
Iceberg, and Hudi using real-world time-series automotive telemetry data with
fields such as vehicle ID, timestamp, location, and event metrics. The
evaluation considers modeling strategies, partitioning, CDC support, query
performance, scalability, data consistency, and ecosystem maturity. Key
findings show Delta Parquet provides strong ML readiness and governance,
Iceberg delivers high performance for batch analytics and cloud-native
workloads, while Hudi is optimized for real-time ingestion and incremental
processing. Each format exhibits tradeoffs in query efficiency, time-travel,
and update semantics. The study offers insights for selecting or combining
formats to support fleet management, predictive maintenance, and route
optimization. Using structured datasets and realistic queries, the results
provide practical guidance for scaling data pipelines and integrating machine
learning models in automotive applications.

Motivation: 代码格式化元素主要用于提高人类可读性，但对LLM处理可能造成计算成本增加和响应时间延长，需要识别这些元素是否必需

Method: 在四种编程语言(Java、Python、C++、C#)和十个LLM上进行大规模实验，测试格式化代码和非格式化代码在Fill-in-the-Middle代码补全任务中的token数量和性能差异

Result: LLM在格式化和非格式化代码上表现相似，平均节省24.5%输入token数量，输出token减少微小；通过提示和微调可进一步节省输出代码长度达36.1%

Conclusion: 移除代码格式化元素是一种有效的LLM效率优化策略，可在保持性能的同时显著降低计算成本，并开发了可集成到LLM推理流程的双向格式处理工具

Abstract: Source code is usually formatted with elements like indentation and newlines
to improve readability for human developers. However, these visual aids do not
seem to be beneficial for large language models (LLMs) in the same way since
the code is processed as a linear sequence of tokens. Furthermore, these
additional tokens can lead to increased computational costs and longer response
times for LLMs. If such formatting elements are non-essential to LLMs, we can
reduce such costs by removing them from the code. To figure out the role played
by formatting elements, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study to evaluate
the impact of code formatting on LLM performance and efficiency. Through
large-scale experiments on Fill-in-the-Middle Code Completion tasks across four
programming languages (Java, Python, C++, C\#) and ten LLMs-including both
commercial and open-source models-we systematically analyze token count and
performance when formatting elements are removed. Key findings indicate that
LLMs can maintain performance across formatted code and unformatted code,
achieving an average input token reduction of 24.5\% with negligible output
token reductions. This makes code format removal a practical optimization
strategy for improving LLM efficiency. Further exploration reveals that both
prompting and fine-tuning LLMs can lead to significant reductions (up to
36.1\%) in output code length without compromising correctness. To facilitate
practical applications, we develop a bidirectional code transformation tool for
format processing, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing LLM
inference workflows, ensuring both human readability and LLM efficiency.

*James Meaden,Michał Jarosz,Piotr Jodłowski,Grigori Melnik*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: COMPASS是一个多维代码生成评估框架，不仅评估功能正确性，还评估算法效率和代码质量，填补了现有基准测试的不足


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成基准测试主要关注功能正确性，但忽略了真实编程中的算法效率和代码质量这两个关键方面

Method: 使用50个来自真实Codility竞赛的编程问题，收集393,150份人工提交作为基线，采用行业标准分析工具系统评估运行时效率和代码质量

Result: 评估三个领先推理增强模型发现，高正确性得分的模型不一定能产生高效算法或可维护代码

Conclusion: 需要超越正确性评估来真正理解代码生成模型的真实能力，COMPASS为构建面向生产使用的AI系统提供了指导框架

Abstract: Current code generation benchmarks focus primarily on functional correctness
while overlooking two critical aspects of real-world programming: algorithmic
efficiency and code quality. We introduce COMPASS (COdility's Multi-dimensional
Programming ASSessment), a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses
code generation across three dimensions: correctness, efficiency, and quality.
COMPASS consists of 50 competitive programming problems from real Codility
competitions, providing authentic human baselines from 393,150 submissions.
Unlike existing benchmarks that treat algorithmically inefficient solutions
identically to optimal ones provided they pass test cases, COMPASS
systematically evaluates runtime efficiency and code quality using
industry-standard analysis tools. Our evaluation of three leading
reasoning-enhanced models, Anthropic Claude Opus 4, Google Gemini 2.5 Pro, and
OpenAI O4-Mini-High, reveals that models achieving high correctness scores do
not necessarily produce efficient algorithms or maintainable code. These
findings highlight the importance of evaluating more than just correctness to
truly understand the real-world capabilities of code generation models. COMPASS
serves as a guiding framework, charting a path for future research toward AI
systems that are robust, reliable, and ready for production use.

LLM-tool interaction. Our experiments demonstrate both the promise of agentic
AI for research in Computational Literary Studies and the essential
infrastructure development needs for reliable Digital Humanities

*Daniel Ogenrwot,John Businge,Shaikh Arifuzzaman*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 通过网络科学技术分析Maven Central Java库依赖图，发现其具有小世界特性的无尺度网络结构，少数核心库支撑着整个生态系统，既提高了效率也带来系统性风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大规模软件生态系统的结构特征和连接模式，以提高软件重用、增强生态系统弹性和减少安全风险。

Method: 使用Goblin框架提取Maven Central依赖图样本，选取度中心性前5000的库作为种子节点，通过广度优先搜索扩展获取达523万节点和2090万边的图结构，计算度分布、中间中心性、PageRank等图论指标。

Result: Maven Central呈现高度互联的无尺度小世界网络结构，少数核心基础设施库（测试框架、通用工具库）支撑着大部分项目，这些关键节点的故障或漏洞可能引发系统性风险。

Conclusion: 核心库在提高软件重用效率的同时也带来了系统性弱点，需要重视生态系统的弹性设计和风险管理。

Abstract: Understanding the structural characteristics and connectivity patterns of
large-scale software ecosystems is critical for enhancing software reuse,
improving ecosystem resilience, and mitigating security risks. In this paper,
we investigate the Maven Central ecosystem, one of the largest repositories of
Java libraries, by applying network science techniques to its dependency graph.
Leveraging the Goblin framework, we extracted a sample consisting of the top
5,000 highly connected artifacts based on their degree centrality and then
performed breadth-first search (BFS) expansion from each selected artifact as a
seed node, traversing the graph outward to capture all libraries and releases
reachable those seed nodes. This sampling strategy captured the immediate
structural context surrounding these libraries resulted in a curated graph
comprising of 1.3 million nodes and 20.9 million edges. We conducted a
comprehensive analysis of this graph, computing degree distributions,
betweenness centrality, PageRank centrality, and connected components
graph-theoretic metrics. Our results reveal that Maven Central exhibits a
highly interconnected, scale-free, and small-world topology, characterized by a
small number of infrastructural hubs that support the majority of projects.
Further analysis using PageRank and betweenness centrality shows that these
hubs predominantly consist of core ecosystem infrastructure, including testing
frameworks and general-purpose utility libraries. While these hubs facilitate
efficient software reuse and integration, they also pose systemic risks;
failures or vulnerabilities affecting these critical nodes can have widespread
and cascading impacts throughout the ecosystem.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的多核架构上缓存争用分析方法，通过精细考虑实际缓存状态和访问次数，大幅减少了WCET估计过高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多核架构上的WCET估计面临缓存共享访问的挑战，现有方法过于高估了远程块访问导致的缓存失效数量，需要更精确的分析方法。

Method: 基于任务程序区域的执行顺序，识别可能受远程访问影响的内存引用，构建细粒度的争用分析来计算基于本地和远程块访问数量的缓存失效数，通过动态规划获取整体互核缓存干扰。

Result: 实验结果显示，与现有方法相比，新方法平均减少48.31%的互核缓存干扰和8.94%的WCET估计，而计算开销没有显著增加。

Conclusion: 该方法通过更精确的缓存状态和访问次数分析，有效减少了多核架构上WCET估计的过高问题，具有良好的实用价值。

Abstract: WCET (Worst-Case Execution Time) estimation on multicore architecture is
particularly challenging mainly due to the complex accesses over cache shared
by multiple cores. Existing analysis identifies possible contentions between
parallel tasks by leveraging the partial order of the tasks or their program
regions. Unfortunately, they overestimate the number of cache misses caused by
a remote block access without considering the actual cache state and the number
of accesses. This paper reports a new analysis for inter-core cache contention.
Based on the order of program regions in a task, we first identify memory
references that could be affected if a remote access occurs in a region.
Afterwards, a fine-grained contention analysis is constructed that computes the
number of cache misses based on the access quantity of local and remote blocks.
We demonstrate that the overall inter-core cache interference of a task can be
obtained via dynamic programming. Experiments show that compared to existing
methods, the proposed analysis reduces inter-core cache interference and WCET
estimations by 52.31% and 8.94% on average, without significantly increasing
computation overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多机器系统依赖手动提示工程，计算效率低且无法从数据中学习，需要一种新的本地化端到端解决方案

Method: 采用多机器蒂联技术将最优多机器系统转换为链式机器路径进行监督精细调整，然后通过机器人强化学习在可验证任务上进一步提升模型能力

Result: Agent基础模型(AFM)在web agent和code agent多个测试集上创造了新的最高性能记录

Conclusion: CoA框架为机器人模型研究提供了坚实的基础，所有研究成果完全开源，推动了机器人学习领域的发展

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex problem-solving tasks such as
deep research, vibe coding, and mathematical reasoning. However, most existing
multi-agent systems are built upon manual prompt/workflow engineering with
sophisticated agent frameworks, making them computationally inefficient, less
capable, and can not benefit from data-centric learning. In this work, we
introduce Chain-of-Agents (CoA), a novel paradigm of LLM reasoning that enables
native end-to-end complex problem-solving in the same way as a multi-agent
system (i.e., multi-turn problem solving with multiple tools and multiple
agents) within one model. In chain-of-agents problem-solving, the model
dynamically activates different tool agents and role-playing agents to simulate
multi-agent collaboration in an end-to-end fashion. To elicit end-to-end
chain-of-agents problem-solving abilities in LLMs, we introduce a multi-agent
distillation framework to distill state-of-the-art multi-agent systems into
chain-of-agents trajectories for agentic supervised fine-tuning. We then use
agentic reinforcement learning on verifiable agentic tasks to further improve
the models' capabilities on chain-of-agents problem solving. We call the
resulting models Agent Foundation Models (AFMs). Our empirical studies
demonstrate that AFM establishes new state-of-the-art performance across
diverse benchmarks in both web agent and code agent settings. We make the
entire research, including the model weights, code for training and evaluation,
and the training data, fully open-sourced, which offers a solid starting point
for future research on agent models and agentic RL.

*Tao An*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Cognitive Workspace新范式，通过模拟人类外部记忆机制，超越传统RAG方法，实现主动记忆管理和任务驱动的上下文优化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在上下文管理方面存在根本性限制，尽管上下文窗口已扩展到百万token，但被动检索系统无法捕捉人类记忆管理的动态任务驱动特性

Method: 基于认知科学理论（Baddeley工作记忆模型、Clark扩展心智理论、Hutchins分布式认知框架），开发三个核心创新：主动记忆管理、分层认知缓冲器、任务驱动上下文优化

Result: 平均58.6%记忆重用率（传统RAG为0%），净效率增益17-18%，统计显著（p < 0.001, Cohen's d > 23）

Conclusion: Cognitive Workspace代表了从信息检索到真正认知增强的根本性转变，为LLM系统提供了首个主动记忆优越性的定量证据

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face fundamental limitations in context
management despite recent advances extending context windows to millions of
tokens. We propose Cognitive Workspace, a novel paradigm that transcends
traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by emulating human cognitive
mechanisms of external memory use. Drawing from cognitive science foundations
including Baddeley's working memory model, Clark's extended mind thesis, and
Hutchins' distributed cognition framework, we demonstrate that current passive
retrieval systems fail to capture the dynamic, task-driven nature of human
memory management. Our analysis of 2024-2025 developments reveals that while
techniques like Infini-attention and StreamingLLM achieve impressive context
lengths, they lack the metacognitive awareness and active planning capabilities
essential for true cognitive extension. Cognitive Workspace addresses these
limitations through three core innovations: (1) active memory management with
deliberate information curation, (2) hierarchical cognitive buffers enabling
persistent working states, and (3) task-driven context optimization that
dynamically adapts to cognitive demands. Empirical validation demonstrates
Cognitive Workspace achieves an average 58.6% memory reuse rate (ranging from
54-60% across different tasks) compared to 0% for traditional RAG, with 17-18%
net efficiency gain despite 3.3x higher operation counts. Statistical analysis
confirms these advantages with p < 0.001 and Cohen's d > 23 across multiple
task types, establishing the first quantitative evidence for active memory
superiority in LLM systems. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework
synthesizing insights from 50+ recent papers, positioning Cognitive Workspace
as a fundamental shift from information retrieval to genuine cognitive
augmentation.

TL;DR: HiFo-Prompt框架通过前瞻性和后顾性提示策略，在进化计算中实现LLM自动启发式设计，显著提升启发式质量、收敛速度和查询效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的自动启发式设计方法存在静态操作符和缺乏知识积累机制的问题，限制了其有效性

Method: 提出HiFo-Prompt框架，包含两种协同提示策略：前瞻性提示基于种群动态自适应引导搜索，管理探索-利用权衡；后顾性提示从过往成功启发式中提炼可重用设计原则，构建持久知识库

Result: 实验结果表明HiFo-Prompt显著优于现有最先进的LLM-based AHD方法，生成更高质量的启发式，同时实现更快的收敛速度和更优的查询效率

Conclusion: HiFo-Prompt的双重机制将瞬时发现转化为持久知识，使LLM能够从自身经验中学习，为自动启发式设计提供了有效的知识积累框架

Abstract: LLM-based Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) within Evolutionary Computation
(EC) frameworks has shown promising results. However, its effectiveness is
hindered by the use of static operators and the lack of knowledge accumulation
mechanisms. We introduce HiFo-Prompt, a framework that guides LLMs with two
synergistic prompting strategies: Foresight and Hindsight. Foresight-based
prompts adaptively steer the search based on population dynamics, managing the
exploration-exploitation trade-off. In addition, hindsight-based prompts mimic
human expertise by distilling successful heuristics from past generations into
fundamental, reusable design principles. This dual mechanism transforms
transient discoveries into a persistent knowledge base, enabling the LLM to
learn from its own experience. Empirical results demonstrate that HiFo-Prompt
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based AHD methods, generating
higher-quality heuristics while achieving substantially faster convergence and
superior query efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出AlphaEval框架，通过五维度评估指标来解决传统金融alpha挖掘模型评估中的问题，包括计算成本高、评估不全面等问题，并开源实现代码以促进领域发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的alpha挖掘模型评估方法存在显著缺陷：回测计算成本高、效率低且对策略参数敏感；相关性指标只考虑预测能力而忽视了时间稳定性、稳健性、多样性和可解释性等关键特性。同时，领域内模型多为闭源，影响了可复现性和进步。

Method: 设计AlphaEval框架，从五个互补维度评估生成alpha的整体质量：预测能力、稳定性、市场干扰稳健性、金融逻辑和多样性。该框架具有统一、并行化和无需回测的特点。

Result: 在代表性alpha挖掘算法上进行了涉幅实验，结果显示AlphaEval能够达到与全面回测相比的评估一致性，同时提供更全面的洞察和更高的效率。此外，AlphaEval能够有效识别出优于传统单指标筛选方法的优质alpha。

Conclusion: AlphaEval作为一个统一、并行化且无需回测的评估框架，有效解决了金融alpha挖掘模型评估中的关键挑战。它通过多维度评估提供了更全面的质量分析，并且开源实现代码以促进领域的可复现性和社区参与。

Abstract: Formula alpha mining, which generates predictive signals from financial data,
is critical for quantitative investment. Although various algorithmic
approaches-such as genetic programming, reinforcement learning, and large
language models-have significantly expanded the capacity for alpha discovery,
systematic evaluation remains a key challenge. Existing evaluation metrics
predominantly include backtesting and correlation-based measures. Backtesting
is computationally intensive, inherently sequential, and sensitive to specific
strategy parameters. Correlation-based metrics, though efficient, assess only
predictive ability and overlook other crucial properties such as temporal
stability, robustness, diversity, and interpretability. Additionally, the
closed-source nature of most existing alpha mining models hinders
reproducibility and slows progress in this field. To address these issues, we
propose AlphaEval, a unified, parallelizable, and backtest-free evaluation
framework for automated alpha mining models. AlphaEval assesses the overall
quality of generated alphas along five complementary dimensions: predictive
power, stability, robustness to market perturbations, financial logic, and
diversity. Extensive experiments across representative alpha mining algorithms
demonstrate that AlphaEval achieves evaluation consistency comparable to
comprehensive backtesting, while providing more comprehensive insights and
higher efficiency. Furthermore, AlphaEval effectively identifies superior
alphas compared to traditional single-metric screening approaches. All
implementations and evaluation tools are open-sourced to promote
reproducibility and community engagement.

Abstract: We study the problem of fitting ontologies and constraints to positive and
negative examples that take the form of a finite relational structure. As
ontology and constraint languages, we consider the description logics
$\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu L}$ and $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu LI}$ as well as several
classes of tuple-generating dependencies (TGDs): full, guarded,
frontier-guarded, frontier-one, and unrestricted TGDs as well as inclusion
dependencies. We pinpoint the exact computational complexity, design
algorithms, and analyze the size of fitting ontologies and TGDs. We also
investigate the related problem of constructing a finite basis of concept
inclusions / TGDs for a given set of finite structures. While finite bases
exist for $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu L}$, $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu LI}$, guarded TGDs,
and inclusion dependencies, they in general do not exist for full,
frontier-guarded and frontier-one TGDs.

Motivation: 提升文本到SQL模型在实际应用中的基础能力和通用性，特别是在WHERE子句语义解析方面的表现。

Conclusion: 该研究为处理基础数据库查询提供了准确性提升的新视角，为处理复杂查询和实际数据库环境中不规则数据的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: To elevate the foundational capabilities and generalization prowess of the
text-to-SQL model in real-world applications, we integrate model
interpretability analysis with execution-guided strategy for semantic parsing
of WHERE clauses in SQL queries. Furthermore, we augment this approach with
filtering adjustments, logical correlation refinements, and model fusion,
culminating in the design of the CESQL model that facilitates conditional
enhancement. Our model excels on the WikiSQL dataset, which is emblematic of
single-table database query tasks, markedly boosting the accuracy of prediction
outcomes. When predicting conditional values in WHERE clauses, we have not only
minimized our dependence on data within the condition columns of tables but
also circumvented the impact of manually labeled training data. Our hope is
that this endeavor to enhance accuracy in processing basic database queries
will offer fresh perspectives for research into handling complex queries and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别和解决搜索基于LLM代理评估中的新型污染问题，确保评测结果的可靠性和详细分析污染对测试效果的影响程度。

Method: 通过分析搜索基于代理的日志，识别HuggingFace等平台上公开数据集的污染问题，并进行阻塞实验和消融实验来验证污染效果。

Result: 在3个常用能力测试集中，约3%的题目存在直接获取到标签数据的情况，阻塞HuggingFace后污染子集的准确率下降约15%。

Conclusion: 提出了评测设计和结果报告的最佳实践，以应对这种新型泄漏问题，确保搜索基于LLM代理评估的可信性。

Abstract: Data contamination refers to the leakage of evaluation data into model
training data, resulting in overfitting to supposedly held-out test sets and
compromising test validity. We identify an analogous issue, search-time
contamination (STC), in evaluating search-based LLM agents which use tools to
gather information from online sources when answering user queries. STC occurs
when the retrieval step surfaces a source containing the test question (or a
near-duplicate) alongside its answer, enabling agents to copy rather than
genuinely infer or reason, undermining benchmark integrity. We find that
HuggingFace, an online platform hosting evaluation datasets, appears among
retrieved sources in search based agent logs. Consequently, agents often
explicitly acknowledge discovering question answer pairs from HuggingFace
within their reasoning chains. On three commonly used capability benchmarks:
Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), SimpleQA, and GPQA, we demonstrate that for
approximately 3% of questions, search-based agents directly find the datasets
with ground truth labels on HuggingFace. When millions of evaluation queries
target the same benchmark, even small, repeated leaks can accelerate the
benchmark's obsolescence, shortening its intended lifecycle. After HuggingFace
is blocked, we observe a drop in accuracy on the contaminated subset of
approximately 15%. We further show through ablation experiments that publicly
accessible evaluation datasets on HuggingFace may not be the sole source of
STC. To this end, we conclude by proposing best practices for benchmark design
and result reporting to address this novel form of leakage and ensure
trustworthy evaluation of search-based LLM agents. To facilitate the auditing
of evaluation results, we also publicly release the complete logs from our
experiments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QuickMerge是一个轻量级token合并框架，通过注意力范数动态选择重要token，使用基于熵的预算估计器，结合轻量级transformer先验来保持自回归兼容性，显著减少计算token数量同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型在语言、视觉和视频领域处理更大输入，token级别的计算成本成为关键瓶颈。现有token选择方法大多是静态的、特定于模态的，或者与自回归生成不兼容。

Method: 提出QuickMerge框架：1）基于注意力范数幅度动态选择重要token；2）使用基于熵的预算估计器指导token数量；3）引入轻量级transformer先验在合并后的token序列上进行训练以保持自回归兼容性。

Result: 在多模态领域评估显示，QuickMerge在计算精度权衡方面取得一致改进，显著减少token数量，同时匹配甚至超过学习型tokenizer和固定patch基线的性能。

Conclusion: QuickMerge通过语义显著性估计、灵活token预算和自回归对齐的组合，实现了使用更少token的准确生成，为解决token计算瓶颈提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: As generative models scale to larger inputs across language, vision, and
video domains, the cost of token-level computation has become a key bottleneck.
While prior work suggests that only a subset of tokens significantly influence
downstream predictions, most token selection methods are static,
modality-specific, or incompatible with autoregressive generation. In this
paper, we propose QuickMerge, a lightweight token merging framework designed
for efficient next-token prediction.
  QuickMerge dynamically selects a reduced number of tokens based on attention
norm magnitude, guided by an entropy-based budget estimator. To preserve
autoregressive compatibility, we introduce a lightweight transformer prior
trained over the merged token sequence. By combining semantic salience
estimation, flexible token budgets, and AR alignment, QuickMerge enables

*Adamo Cerioli,Edward D. Lee,Vito D. P. Servedio*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究通过棋子互动网络指标量化国际象棋中的战略张力，发现顶级AI比人类棋手能维持更长时间的高水平战略张力，揭示了AI和人类在复杂战略环境中的不同应对策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究战略决策中即时机会与长期目标之间的张力平衡，通过比较人类对局和AI对局来理解这种权衡的本质差异。

Method: 提出基于棋子互动网络的量化指标来测量棋盘上的战略张力，分析人类vs人类和AIvsAI对局中张力的演化模式。

Result: 顶级AI玩家比精英人类玩家能维持更长时间的高水平战略张力；人类玩家的累积张力在约1600和2300 Elo等级时出现显著跃升；AI倾向于容忍攻守平衡的复杂局面，而人类则限制张力和游戏复杂度。

Conclusion: AI和人类在战略决策中存在根本性差异，这种差异对AI在复杂战略环境中的应用具有重要启示意义。

Abstract: Strategic decision-making involves managing the tension between immediate
opportunities and long-term objectives. We study this trade-off in chess by
characterizing and comparing dynamics between human vs human and AI vs AI
games. We propose a network-based metric of piece-to-piece interaction to
quantify the ongoing strategic tension on the board. Its evolution in games
reveals that the most competitive AI players sustain higher levels of strategic
tension for longer durations than elite human players. Cumulative tension
varies with algorithmic complexity for AI and correspondingly in human-played
games increases abruptly with expertise at about 1600 Elo and again at 2300
Elo. The profiles reveal different approaches. Highly competitive AI tolerates
interconnected positions balanced between offensive and defensive tactics over
long periods. Human play, in contrast, limits tension and game complexity,
which may reflect cognitive limitations and adaptive strategies. The difference
may have implications for AI usage in complex, strategic environments.

Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的智能体记忆方法主要关注偏好对齐和简单问答，但现实复杂任务需要对大量用户信息进行多跳推理，当前记忆方法在这方面存在显著挑战。

Method: 明确定义多跳个性化推理任务，构建数据集和统一评估框架，实现各种显式和隐式记忆方法，探索混合范式并提出HybridMem方法。

Result: 通过全面实验从多角度评估不同记忆方法的性能，分析其优缺点，证明了提出的HybridMem模型的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为解决个性化信息的多跳推理问题提供了系统性的任务定义、数据集和评估框架，提出的混合记忆方法在复杂推理任务中表现出色，为相关研究社区提供了有价值的资源。

Abstract: In large language model-based agents, memory serves as a critical capability
for achieving personalization by storing and utilizing users' information.
Although some previous studies have adopted memory to implement user
personalization, they typically focus on preference alignment and simple
question-answering. However, in the real world, complex tasks often require
multi-hop reasoning on a large amount of user information, which poses
significant challenges for current memory approaches. To address this
limitation, we propose the multi-hop personalized reasoning task to explore how
different memory mechanisms perform in multi-hop reasoning over personalized
information. We explicitly define this task and construct a dataset along with
a unified evaluation framework. Then, we implement various explicit and
implicit memory methods and conduct comprehensive experiments. We evaluate
their performance on this task from multiple perspectives and analyze their
strengths and weaknesses. Besides, we explore hybrid approaches that combine
both paradigms and propose the HybridMem method to address their limitations.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model through extensive
experiments. To benefit the research community, we release this project at

Result: 相比多模态模型直接提取，DIVE显著提高了数据提取的准确性和覆盖范围：商业模型提升10-15%，开源模型提升超过30%；建立了包含4,000篇文献中30,000条条目的数据库；建立了快速逆向设计工作流，可在2分钟内识别未报道的氢存储成分

Conclusion: 提出的AI工作流和智能体设计可广泛适用于不同材料，为AI驱动的材料发现提供了新范式

Abstract: Data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) approaches are fundamentally
transforming the discovery of new materials. Despite the unprecedented
availability of materials data in the scientific literature, much of this
information remains trapped in unstructured figures and tables, hindering the
construction of large language model (LLM)-based AI agent for automated
materials design. Here, we present the Descriptive Interpretation of Visual
Expression (DIVE) multi-agent workflow, which systematically reads and
organizes experimental data from graphical elements in scientific literatures.
We focus on solid-state hydrogen storage materials-a class of materials central
to future clean-energy technologies and demonstrate that DIVE markedly improves
the accuracy and coverage of data extraction compared to the direct extraction
by multimodal models, with gains of 10-15% over commercial models and over 30%
relative to open-source models. Building on a curated database of over 30,000
entries from 4,000 publications, we establish a rapid inverse design workflow
capable of identifying previously unreported hydrogen storage compositions in
two minutes. The proposed AI workflow and agent design are broadly transferable
across diverse materials, providing a paradigm for AI-driven materials
discovery.

Motivation: 心血管疾病是全球首要死因，医疗人员短缺严重。AI助手有潜力缓解这一问题，但现有方法在临床应用中存在四大限制：基于prompt的角色分配、固定工作流、静态知识库和单一模态输入

Method: 提出CardAIc-Agents多模态框架：1）CardiacRAG助手从可更新心血知识生成通用计划；2）主助手集成工具自主执行计划并做出决策；3）步进更新策略根据执行结果动态优化计划；4）多学科讨论工具处理具有挑战性的案例；5）视觉审查面板支持最终验证

Conclusion: CardAIc-Agents通过外部工具增强、适应性理论和多模态协同，有效解决了传统AI医疗应用的限制，为心血管疾病的自动化早期检测和主动筛查提供了有效的多模态框架支持

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the foremost cause of mortality
worldwide, a burden worsened by a severe deficit of healthcare workers.
Artificial intelligence (AI) agents have shown potential to alleviate this gap
via automated early detection and proactive screening, yet their clinical
application remains limited by: 1) prompt-based clinical role assignment that
relies on intrinsic model capabilities without domain-specific tool support; or
2) rigid sequential workflows, whereas clinical care often requires adaptive
reasoning that orders specific tests and, based on their results, guides
personalised next steps; 3) general and static knowledge bases without
continuous learning capability; and 4) fixed unimodal or bimodal inputs and
lack of on-demand visual outputs when further clarification is needed. In
response, a multimodal framework, CardAIc-Agents, was proposed to augment
models with external tools and adaptively support diverse cardiac tasks.
Specifically, a CardiacRAG agent generated general plans from updatable cardiac
knowledge, while the chief agent integrated tools to autonomously execute these
plans and deliver decisions. To enable adaptive and case-specific
customization, a stepwise update strategy was proposed to dynamically refine
plans based on preceding execution results, once the task was assessed as
complex. In addition, a multidisciplinary discussion tool was introduced to
interpret challenging cases, thereby supporting further adaptation. When
clinicians raised concerns, visual review panels were provided to assist final
validation. Experiments across three datasets showed the efficiency of
CardAIc-Agents compared to mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
state-of-the-art agentic systems, and fine-tuned VLMs.

### [224] [LOOP: A Plug-and-Play Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Enhancing Planning in Autonomous Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13371)
*Ronit Virwani,Ruchika Suryawanshi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Planning is one of the most critical tasks in autonomous systems, where even
a small error can lead to major failures or million-dollar losses. Current
state-of-the-art neural planning approaches struggle with complex domains,
producing plans with missing preconditions, inconsistent goals, and
hallucinations. While classical planners provide logical guarantees, they lack
the flexibility and natural language understanding capabilities needed for
modern autonomous systems. Existing neuro-symbolic approaches use one-shot
translation from natural language to formal plans, missing the opportunity for
neural and symbolic components to work and refine solutions together. To
address this gap, we develop LOOP -- a novel neuro-symbolic planning framework
that treats planning as an iterative conversation between neural and symbolic
components rather than simple translation. LOOP integrates 13 coordinated
neural features including graph neural networks for spatial relationships,
multi-agent validation for consensus-based correctness, hierarchical
decomposition for complex task management, and causal memory that learns from
both successes and failures. Unlike existing approaches, LOOP generates PDDL
specifications, refines them iteratively based on symbolic feedback, and builds
a causal knowledge base from execution traces. LOOP was evaluated on six
standard IPC benchmark domains, where it achieved 85.8% success rate compared
to LLM+P (55.0%), LLM-as-Planner (19.2%), and Tree-of-Thoughts (3.3%). This
work shows that the key to reliable planning is not in choosing between neural
networks or symbolic reasoners but it lies in making them actually ``talk'' to
each other during the entire process. LOOP provides a thorough blueprint for
building autonomous systems that can finally be trusted with critical
real-world applications.

TL;DR: SPANER是一个模态无关的参数高效微调框架，通过共享提示机制将不同模态输入嵌入到统一语义空间，提升跨模态泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态PEFT方法主要关注任务特定性能提升，但忽视了多模态嵌入空间的结构，导致模态特定表示孤立，限制了跨模态泛化

Method: 提出SPANER框架，采用共享提示机制作为概念锚点，使语义相关实例在空间中收敛，支持无缝集成新模态（如音频）而无需改变核心架构

Result: 在视觉-语言和音频-视觉基准测试中，SPANER展示了具有竞争力的少样本检索性能，同时保持了学习嵌入空间的高语义一致性

Conclusion: 研究表明对齐嵌入结构比仅仅调整适配器权重对于可扩展多模态学习更为重要

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) have
significantly improved performance on downstream tasks such as few-shot
retrieval. However, most existing approaches focus on task-specific gains while
neglecting the structure of the multimodal embedding space. As a result,
modality-specific representations often remain isolated, limiting cross-modal
generalisation. In this work, we introduce Shared Prompt AligNER (SPANER), a
modality-agnostic PEFT framework designed to embed inputs from diverse
modalities into a unified semantic space. At its core, SPANER employs a shared
prompt mechanism that acts as a conceptual anchor, enabling semantically
related instances to converge spatially regardless of modality. This shared
prompt design is inherently extensible, supporting the seamless integration of
additional modalities, such as audio, without altering the core architecture.
Through comprehensive experiments across vision-language and audio-visual
benchmarks, SPANER demonstrates competitive few-shot retrieval performance
while preserving high semantic coherence in the learned embedding space. Our
results highlight the importance of aligning embedding structures, rather than
merely tuning adapter weights, for scalable multimodal learning.

TL;DR: TASER是一个持续学习的智能表格提取系统，专门处理现实世界中高度非结构化、多页、异构的金融表格，通过模式引导的提取和推荐机制，显著优于现有表格检测模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实金融文档中的表格信息往往被埋没在混乱的多页碎片化表格中，99.4%的表格没有边界框，且表格结构极其复杂，需要专门的处理系统。

Method: 采用智能代理系统执行表格检测、分类、提取和推荐，利用初始模式并通过推荐代理审查输出、建议模式修订，实现持续学习。

Result: TASER比Table Transformer等现有表格检测模型性能提升10.1%，大批量处理使可操作模式建议增加104.3%，提取持仓量增加9.8%。

Conclusion: 智能模式引导提取系统在理解现实世界金融表格方面展现出巨大潜力，持续学习过程对提升性能至关重要。

Abstract: Real-world financial documents report essential information about an entity's
financial holdings that can span millions of different financial instrument
types. Yet, these details are often buried in messy, multi-page, fragmented
tables - for example, 99.4% of the tables in our dataset have no bounding boxes
with the maximum number of rows amounting to 426 per table across 44 pages. To
tackle these unique challenges from real-world tables, we present a
continuously learning, agentic table extraction system, TASER (Table Agents for
Schema-guided Extraction and Recommendation) that extracts highly unstructured,
multi-page, heterogeneous tables into normalized, schema-conforming outputs.
Our table agents execute on table detection, classification, extraction, and
recommendations by leveraging an initial schema. Then, our Recommender Agent
reviews the outputs, recommends schema revisions, and decides on the final
recommendations, enabling TASER to outperform existing table detection models
such as Table Transformer by 10.1%. Within this continuous learning process, we
highlight that larger batch sizes result in a 104.3% increase in schema
recommendations that are actionable and utilized, resulting in a 9.8% increase
in extracted holdings - highlighting the importance of a continuous learning
process. To train TASER, we have manually labeled 22,584 pages (28,150,449
tokens), 3,213 tables for $731,685,511,687 of holdings culminating in one of
the first real financial table datasets. We release our dataset TASERTab to
enable the research community to access real-world financial tables and
outputs. Our results highlight the promise of agentic, schema-guided extraction
systems for robust understanding of real-world financial tables.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems are transforming scientific discovery by
accelerating specific research tasks, from protein structure prediction to
materials design, yet remain confined to narrow domains requiring substantial
human oversight. The exponential growth of scientific literature and increasing
domain specialisation constrain researchers' capacity to synthesise knowledge
across disciplines and develop unifying theories, motivating exploration of
more general-purpose AI systems for science. Here we show that a
domain-agnostic, agentic AI system can independently navigate the scientific
workflow - from hypothesis generation through data collection to manuscript
preparation. The system autonomously designed and executed three psychological
studies on visual working memory, mental rotation, and imagery vividness,
executed one new online data collection with 288 participants, developed
analysis pipelines through 8-hour+ continuous coding sessions, and produced
completed manuscripts. The results demonstrate the capability of AI scientific
discovery pipelines to conduct non-trivial research with theoretical reasoning
and methodological rigour comparable to experienced researchers, though with
limitations in conceptual nuance and theoretical interpretation. This is a step
toward embodied AI that can test hypotheses through real-world experiments,
accelerating discovery by autonomously exploring regions of scientific space
that human cognitive and resource constraints might otherwise leave unexplored.
It raises important questions about the nature of scientific understanding and
the attribution of scientific credit.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal traffic forecasting is challenging due to complex temporal

Result: 在语言模型量化中比现有方法提升15%，离散断层成像重建错误降低16%且GPU速度提升6倍，FIR滤波器设计波纹减少50%

Conclusion: DMMV作为一个通用的优化框架具有广泛应用价值，所提出的GPU加速贫估算法在多个领域都取得了显著成效

Abstract: We introduce the Discrete Min-Max Violation (DMMV) as a general optimization
problem which seeks an assignment of discrete values to variables that
minimizes the largest constraint violation. This context-free mathematical
formulation is applicable to a wide range of use cases that have worst-case
performance requirements. After defining the DMMV problem mathematically, we
explore its properties to establish a foundational understanding. To tackle
DMMV instance sizes of practical relevance, we develop a GPU-accelerated
heuristic that takes advantage of the mathematical properties of DMMV for
speeding up the solution process. We demonstrate the versatile applicability of
our heuristic by solving three optimization problems as use cases: (1)
post-training quantization of language models, (2) discrete tomography, and (3)
Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter design. In quantization without outlier
separation, our heuristic achieves 14% improvement on average over existing
methods. In discrete tomography, it reduces reconstruction error by 16% under
uniform noise and accelerates computations by a factor of 6 on GPU. For FIR
filter design, it nearly achieves 50% ripple reduction compared to using the
commercial integer optimization solver, Gurobi. Our comparative results point
to the benefits of studying DMMV as a context-free optimization problem and the
advantages that our proposed heuristic offers on three distinct problems. Our
GPU-accelerated heuristic will be made open-source to further stimulate
research on DMMV and its other applications. The code is available at

Motivation: 语言模型代理在安全关键场景中存在严重风险，虽然具备风险知识，但在实际执行中无法有效识别和避免危险操作，需要系统性地评估和改进其安全能力。

Method: 开发了包含三个维度的评估框架：风险知识、风险识别能力和安全执行行为。基于发现的性能差距，构建了风险验证器系统，包含抽象器将具体执行轨迹转换为抽象描述，使模型能更有效识别风险。

Result: 评估显示代理风险知识接近完美（>98%通过率），但实际风险识别性能下降>23%，危险操作执行通过率<26%。风险验证系统将危险行为执行率降低了55.3%。

Conclusion: 单纯扩展模型能力或推理计算无法解决安全问题，需要专门的安全机制。风险验证器系统能有效减少危险操作执行，为解决语言模型代理的安全问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents have demonstrated significant potential for
automating real-world tasks, yet they pose a diverse array of potential, severe
risks in safety-critical scenarios. In this work, we identify a significant gap
between LM agents' risk awareness and safety execution abilities: while they
often answer "Yes" to queries like "Is executing `sudo rm -rf /*' dangerous?",
they will likely fail to identify such risks in instantiated trajectories or
even directly perform these risky actions when acting as agents. To
systematically investigate this, we develop a comprehensive evaluation
framework to examine agents' safety across three progressive dimensions: 1)
their knowledge about potential risks, 2) their ability to identify
corresponding risks in execution trajectories, and 3) their actual behaviors to
avoid executing these risky actions. Our evaluation reveals two critical
performance gaps that resemble the generator-validator gaps observed in LMs:
while agents demonstrate near-perfect risk knowledge ($>98\%$ pass rates), they
fail to apply this knowledge when identifying risks in actual scenarios (with
performance dropping by $>23\%$) and often still execute risky actions ($<26\%$
pass rates). Notably, this trend persists across more capable LMs as well as in
specialized reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1, indicating that simply scaling
model capabilities or inference compute does not inherently resolve safety
concerns. Instead, we take advantage of these observed gaps to develop a risk
verifier that independently critiques the proposed actions by agents, with an
abstractor that converts specific execution trajectories into abstract
descriptions where LMs can more effectively identify the risks. Our overall
system achieves a significant reduction of risky action execution by $55.3\%$
over vanilla-prompted agents.

Abstract: Developing general-purpose embodied agents is a core challenge in AI.
Minecraft provides rich complexity and internet-scale data, but its slow speed
and engineering overhead make it unsuitable for rapid prototyping. Crafter
offers a lightweight alternative that retains key challenges from Minecraft,
yet its use has remained limited to narrow tasks due to the absence of
foundation models that have driven progress in the Minecraft setting. In this
paper, we present CrafterDojo, a suite of foundation models and tools that
unlock the Crafter environment as a lightweight, prototyping-friendly, and
Minecraft-like testbed for general-purpose embodied agent research. CrafterDojo
addresses this by introducing CrafterVPT, CrafterCLIP, and CrafterSteve-1 for
behavior priors, vision-language grounding, and instruction following,
respectively. In addition, we provide toolkits for generating behavior and
caption datasets (CrafterPlay and CrafterCaption), reference agent

Abstract: Improving large language models (LLMs) for electronic health record (EHR)
reasoning is essential for enabling accurate and generalizable clinical
predictions. While LLMs excel at medical text understanding, they underperform
on EHR-based prediction tasks due to challenges in modeling temporally
structured, high-dimensional data. Existing approaches often rely on hybrid
paradigms, where LLMs serve merely as frozen prior retrievers while downstream
deep learning (DL) models handle prediction, failing to improve the LLM's
intrinsic reasoning capacity and inheriting the generalization limitations of
DL models. To this end, we propose EAG-RL, a novel two-stage training framework
designed to intrinsically enhance LLMs' EHR reasoning ability through expert
attention guidance, where expert EHR models refer to task-specific DL models
trained on EHR data. Concretely, EAG-RL first constructs high-quality, stepwise
reasoning trajectories using expert-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search to
effectively initialize the LLM's policy. Then, EAG-RL further optimizes the
policy via reinforcement learning by aligning the LLM's attention with
clinically salient features identified by expert EHR models. Extensive
experiments on two real-world EHR datasets show that EAG-RL improves the
intrinsic EHR reasoning ability of LLMs by an average of 14.62%, while also
enhancing robustness to feature perturbations and generalization to unseen
clinical domains. These results demonstrate the practical potential of EAG-RL
for real-world deployment in clinical prediction tasks. Our code have been

TL;DR: 这篇论文探索了多模态结构化强化学习(MSRL)在图表到代码生成任务中的应用，通过多级利奖系统突破了监督学习的性能平台。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图表到代码生成需要复杂的视觉理解和结构化输出，但传统的监督学习(SFT)方法存在性能平台，需要更有效的强化学习策略来奖励结构化输出。

Method: 提出多模态结构化强化学习(MSRL)方法，构建了包含300万对图表-代码对的大规模训练集。采用多级利奖系统：文本级利用规则基础奖励验证细粒度代码细节，视觉级通过渲染生成代码到图像并使用评估模型来评估结构相似性，采用两阶段课程进行训练稳定性优化。

Result: MSRL方法显著突破了SFT的性能平台，在ChartMimic和ReachQA净高基准上分别提升了6.2%和9.9%，达到了与先进闭源模型相竞争的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了多模态结构化强化学习在复杂视觉-语言任务中的有效性，通过多级利奖系统实现了对结构化输出的更好奖励，为类似任务提供了有价值的方法论指导。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective for general
reasoning in vision-language models, its application to tasks requiring
in-depth understanding of information-rich images and generation of structured
outputs remains underexplored. Chart-to-code generation exemplifies this
challenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate
structured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient,
highlighting the need for effective RL strategies that appropriately reward
structured outputs. We systematically investigate the performance plateau in
SFT through large-scale experiments and propose Multimodal Structured
Reinforcement Learning (MSRL) for chart-to-code generation, which substantially
breaks through this plateau. We construct the largest training corpus to date,
containing 3 million chart-code pairs from real-world arXiv tables to mitigate
simplistic patterns of prior synthetic data. Despite reaching state-of-the-art
performance, our experiments show that scaling SFT data eventually hits a
plateau where further increases yield negligible improvements. Our MSRL method
leverages a multi-granularity structured reward system using multimodal textual
and visual feedback. At the textual level, rule-based rewards validate
fine-grained code details. At the visual level, model-based rewards assess
structural similarity by rendering generated code into images and employing an
evaluator model. We implement this within a two-stage curriculum for training
stability. Results demonstrate that MSRL significantly breaks the SFT plateau,
improving high-level metrics by 6.2% and 9.9% on ChartMimic and ReachQA
benchmarks respectively, achieving competitive performance with advanced
closed-source models.

TL;DR: V2P方法通过抑制注意力机制和Fitts定律启发的2D高斯热图建模，解决了GUI元素定位中的背景干扰和中心边缘区分问题，在ScreenSpot基准测试中达到92.3%和50.5%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GUI元素定位方法忽视空间交互不确定性和视觉语义层次结构，现有注意力方法存在背景区域干扰导致注意力漂移，以及均匀标注无法区分目标UI元素中心与边缘的问题。

Method: 提出Valley-to-Peak (V2P)方法：1) 抑制注意力机制减少对无关背景区域的关注；2) 基于Fitts定律的2D高斯热图建模，权重从中心向边缘递减，方差由目标大小决定。

Result: 在两个基准测试ScreenSpot-v2和ScreenSpot-Pro上分别达到92.3%和50.5%的准确率，消融实验证实了各组件贡献。

Conclusion: V2P方法能有效隔离目标区域并让模型专注于UI元素的最关键点，具有精确GUI定位任务的通用性。

Abstract: Precise localization of GUI elements is crucial for the development of GUI
agents. Traditional methods rely on bounding box or center-point regression,
neglecting spatial interaction uncertainty and visual-semantic hierarchies.
Recent methods incorporate attention mechanisms but still face two key issues:
(1) ignoring processing background regions causes attention drift from the
desired area, and (2) uniform labeling fails to distinguish between center and
edges of the target UI element, leading to click imprecision. Inspired by how
humans visually process and interact with GUI elements, we propose the
Valley-to-Peak (V2P) method to address these issues. To mitigate background
distractions, V2P introduces a suppression attention mechanism that minimizes
the model's focus on irrelevant regions to highlight the intended region. For
the issue of center-edge distinction, V2P applies a Fitts' Law-inspired
approach by modeling GUI interactions as 2D Gaussian heatmaps where the weight
gradually decreases from the center towards the edges. The weight distribution
follows a Gaussian function, with the variance determined by the target's size.
Consequently, V2P effectively isolates the target area and teaches the model to
concentrate on the most essential point of the UI element. The model trained by
V2P achieves the performance with 92.3% and 50.5% on two benchmarks
ScreenSpot-v2 and ScreenSpot-Pro. Ablations further confirm each component's
contribution, highlighting V2P's generalizability for precise GUI grounding
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱问答方法主要关注一阶逻辑形式的查询，但现实世界中的很多查询包含模糊或上下文相关的软约束（如属性偏好或相关类别偏好），现有方法无法有效处理这类需求。

Method: 提出了神经查询重排器(NQR)，通过交互式方式基于偏好的实体示例和非偏好实体示例来逐步优化答案评分，整合软约束条件。

Result: 实验结果表明，NQR能够有效捕捉软约束，同时保持稳健的查询问答性能。扩展了现有QA基准，生成了包含软约束的数据集进行验证。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了知识图谱问答中处理软约束的空白，为处理现实世界中模糊和上下文相关的查询需求提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Methods for query answering over incomplete knowledge graphs retrieve
entities that are likely to be answers, which is particularly useful when such
answers cannot be reached by direct graph traversal due to missing edges.
However, existing approaches have focused on queries formalized using
first-order-logic. In practice, many real-world queries involve constraints
that are inherently vague or context-dependent, such as preferences for
attributes or related categories. Addressing this gap, we introduce the problem
of query answering with soft constraints. We propose a Neural Query Reranker
(NQR) designed to adjust query answer scores by incorporating soft constraints
without disrupting the original answers to a query. NQR operates interactively,
refining answers based on incremental examples of preferred and non-preferred
entities. We extend existing QA benchmarks by generating datasets with soft
constraints. Our experiments demonstrate that NQR can capture soft constraints
while maintaining robust query answering performance.

Conclusion: ITL-LIME框架通过引入实例转移学习有效解决了LIME在数据稀缺情况下的局限性，提供了更稳定和可靠的黑盒模型解释方案

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, such as Local
Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), have advanced the
interpretability of black-box machine learning models by approximating their
behavior locally using interpretable surrogate models. However, LIME's inherent
randomness in perturbation and sampling can lead to locality and instability
issues, especially in scenarios with limited training data. In such cases, data
scarcity can result in the generation of unrealistic variations and samples
that deviate from the true data manifold. Consequently, the surrogate model may
fail to accurately approximate the complex decision boundary of the original
model. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Instance-based Transfer
Learning LIME framework (ITL-LIME) that enhances explanation fidelity and
stability in data-constrained environments. ITL-LIME introduces instance
transfer learning into the LIME framework by leveraging relevant real instances
from a related source domain to aid the explanation process in the target
domain. Specifically, we employ clustering to partition the source domain into
clusters with representative prototypes. Instead of generating random
perturbations, our method retrieves pertinent real source instances from the
source cluster whose prototype is most similar to the target instance. These
are then combined with the target instance's neighboring real instances. To
define a compact locality, we further construct a contrastive learning-based
encoder as a weighting mechanism to assign weights to the instances from the
combined set based on their proximity to the target instance. Finally, these
weighted source and target instances are used to train the surrogate model for
explanation purposes.

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs are used for various purposes, including business

paper, we investigate knowledge graphs describing household actions, which are
beneficial for controlling household robots and analyzing video footage. In the
latter case, the information extracted from videos is notoriously incomplete,
and completing the knowledge graph for enhancing the situational picture is
essential. In this paper, we show that, while a standard link prediction
problem, situational knowledge graphs have special characteristics that render
many link prediction algorithms not fit for the job, and unable to outperform
even simple baselines.

Conclusion: MHSNet能够有效解决简历重复检测中的挑战，提升第三方简历质量并丰富公司人才库。

Abstract: To maintain the company's talent pool, recruiters need to continuously search
for resumes from third-party websites (e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed). However,
fetched resumes are often incomplete and inaccurate. To improve the quality of
third-party resumes and enrich the company's talent pool, it is essential to
conduct duplication detection between the fetched resumes and those already in
the company's talent pool. Such duplication detection is challenging due to the
semantic complexity, structural heterogeneity, and information incompleteness
of resume texts. To this end, we propose MHSNet, an multi-level identity
verification framework that fine-tunes BGE-M3 using contrastive learning. With
the fine-tuned , Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) generates multi-level sparse and
dense representations for resumes, enabling the computation of corresponding
multi-level semantic similarities. Moreover, the state-aware Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) is employed in MHSNet to handle diverse incomplete resumes. Experimental
results verify the effectiveness of MHSNet

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results across various
tasks, yet their reasoning capabilities remain a fundamental challenge.
Developing AI systems with strong reasoning capabilities is regarded as a
crucial milestone in the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and
has garnered considerable attention from both academia and industry. Various
techniques have been explored to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs,
with neuro-symbolic approaches being a particularly promising way. This paper
comprehensively reviews recent developments in neuro-symbolic approaches for
enhancing LLM reasoning. We first present a formalization of reasoning tasks
and give a brief introduction to the neurosymbolic learning paradigm. Then, we
discuss neuro-symbolic methods for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs
from three perspectives: Symbolic->LLM, LLM->Symbolic, and LLM+Symbolic.
Finally, we discuss several key challenges and promising future directions. We

Abstract: We contribute a theoretical and operational framework for neurosymbolic AI
called DeepLog. DeepLog introduces building blocks and primitives for
neurosymbolic AI that make abstraction of commonly used representations and
computational mechanisms used in neurosymbolic AI. DeepLog can represent and
emulate a wide range of neurosymbolic systems. It consists of two key
components. The first is the DeepLog language for specifying neurosymbolic
models and inference tasks. This language consists of an annotated neural
extension of grounded first-order logic, and makes abstraction of the type of
logic, e.g. boolean, fuzzy or probabilistic, and whether logic is used in the
architecture or in the loss function. The second DeepLog component is situated
at the computational level and uses extended algebraic circuits as
computational graphs. Together these two components are to be considered as a
neurosymbolic abstract machine, with the DeepLog language as the intermediate
level of abstraction and the circuits level as the computational one. DeepLog
is implemented in software, relies on the latest insights in implementing
algebraic circuits on GPUs, and is declarative in that it is easy to obtain
different neurosymbolic models by making different choices for the underlying
algebraic structures and logics. The generality and efficiency of the DeepLog
neurosymbolic machine is demonstrated through an experimental comparison
between 1) different fuzzy and probabilistic logics, 2) between using logic in
the architecture or in the loss function, and 3) between a standalone CPU-based
implementation of a neurosymbolic AI system and a DeepLog GPU-based one.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CausalPlan是一个两阶段框架，通过将显式结构因果推理集成到LLM规划过程中，解决了LLM代理在协作任务中产生因果无效动作的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型代理（尤其是较小的开源模型）在协作任务中经常产生因果无效或不连贯的动作，因为它们依赖表面相关性而非基于因果推理，这限制了它们在动态环境中的协调和规划能力。

Method: 提出CausalPlan框架，核心是结构因果行动（SCA）模型，从代理轨迹中学习因果图来捕捉先前行动和当前环境状态如何影响未来决策。该结构用于通过分配因果分数来指导动作选择，重新加权LLM生成的提议，或在需要时回退到因果基础的替代方案。

Result: 在Overcooked-AI基准测试的五个多代理协调任务和四个不同规模的LLM上进行评估，CausalPlan持续减少了无效动作，在AI-AI和人类-AI设置中都改善了协作性能，优于强化学习基线。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了因果驱动规划对于部署高效、可解释和可泛化的多代理LLM系统的价值，无需对LLM本身进行微调。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents-especially smaller, open-source
models-often produce causally invalid or incoherent actions in collaborative
tasks due to their reliance on surface-level correlations rather than grounded
causal reasoning. This limitation undermines their performance in terms of
coordination and planning in dynamic environments. We address this challenge
with CausalPlan, a two-phase framework that integrates explicit structural
causal reasoning into the LLM planning process. At the core of CausalPlan is
the Structural Causal Action (SCA) model, which learns a causal graph from
agent trajectories to capture how prior actions and current environment states
influence future decisions. This structure is then used to guide action
selection by assigning causal scores to LLM-generated proposals, reweighting
them accordingly, or falling back to causally grounded alternatives when
needed. By embedding this causal knowledge directly into the decision loop,
CausalPlan constrains planning to intervention-consistent behaviours without
requiring fine-tuning of the LLM itself. We evaluate CausalPlan on the
Overcooked-AI benchmark across five multi-agent coordination tasks and four
LLMs of varying sizes: Gemma-7B, Llama-8B, Qwen-14B, and Llama-70B.
Experimental results show that CausalPlan consistently reduces invalid actions
and improves collaboration in both AI-AI and human-AI settings, outperforming
strong reinforcement learning baselines. Our findings highlight the value of
causality-driven planning for deploying efficient, interpretable, and
generalisable multi-agent LLM systems.

Conclusion: EMRC框架通过专家感知的智能体招募策略和智能体互补性，有效利用了各LLM的专业能力，显著提升了医疗决策性能

Abstract: Medical Decision-Making (MDM) is a complex process requiring substantial
domain-specific expertise to effectively synthesize heterogeneous and
complicated clinical information. While recent advancements in Large Language
Models (LLMs) show promise in supporting MDM, single-LLM approaches are limited
by their parametric knowledge constraints and static training corpora, failing
to robustly integrate the clinical information. To address this challenge, we
propose the Expertise-aware Multi-LLM Recruitment and Collaboration (EMRC)
framework to enhance the accuracy and reliability of MDM systems. It operates
in two stages: (i) expertise-aware agent recruitment and (ii) confidence- and
adversarial-driven multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, in the first stage,
we use a publicly available corpus to construct an LLM expertise table for
capturing expertise-specific strengths of multiple LLMs across medical
department categories and query difficulty levels. This table enables the
subsequent dynamic selection of the optimal LLMs to act as medical expert
agents for each medical query during the inference phase. In the second stage,
we employ selected agents to generate responses with self-assessed confidence
scores, which are then integrated through the confidence fusion and adversarial
validation to improve diagnostic reliability. We evaluate our EMRC framework on
three public MDM datasets, where the results demonstrate that our EMRC
outperforms state-of-the-art single- and multi-LLM methods, achieving superior
diagnostic performance. For instance, on the MMLU-Pro-Health dataset, our EMRC
achieves 74.45% accuracy, representing a 2.69% improvement over the
best-performing closed-source model GPT- 4-0613, which demonstrates the
effectiveness of our expertise-aware agent recruitment strategy and the agent
complementarity in leveraging each LLM's specialized capabilities.

Abstract: Quantified formulas pose a significant challenge for Satisfiability Modulo

instantiation techniques, such as e-matching, syntax-guided, model-based,

paper introduces a novel instantiation approach that dynamically learns from
these techniques during solving. By treating observed instantiations as samples
from a latent language, we use probabilistic context-free grammars to generate
new, similar terms. Our method not only mimics successful past instantiations
but also explores diversity by optionally inverting learned term probabilities,
aiming to balance exploitation and exploration in quantifier reasoning.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology has been widely applied in
recent years. However, despite the emergence of various RAG frameworks, a
single RAG framework still cannot adapt well to a broad range of downstream
tasks. Therefore, how to leverage the advantages of multiple RAG systems has
become an area worth exploring. To address this issue, we have conducted a
comprehensive and systematic investigation into ensemble methods based on RAG
systems. Specifically, we have analyzed the RAG ensemble framework from both
theoretical and mechanistic analysis perspectives. From the theoretical
analysis, we provide the first explanation of the RAG ensemble framework from
the perspective of information entropy. In terms of mechanism analysis, we have
explored the RAG ensemble framework from both the pipeline and module levels.
We carefully select four different pipelines (Branching, Iterative, Loop, and
Agentic) and three different modules (Generator, Retriever, and Reranker) to
solve seven different research questions. The experiments show that aggregating
multiple RAG systems is both generalizable and robust, whether at the pipeline
level or the module level. Our work lays the foundation for similar research on
the multi-RAG system ensemble.

Abstract: LLMs have recently been used to generate Python programs representing
generalized plans in PDDL planning, i.e., plans that generalize across the
tasks of a given PDDL domain. Previous work proposed a framework consisting of
three steps: the LLM first generates a summary and then a strategy for the
domain, both in natural language, and then implements that strategy as a Python
program, that gets debugged on example planning tasks. In that work, only one
strategy is generated and passed directly to the program generation. If the
strategy is incorrect, its implementation will therefore result in an incorrect
generalized plan. Here, we introduce an approach that generates the strategy in
the form of pseudocode and enables automatic debugging of the pseudocode, hence
allowing us to identify and fix errors prior to the generation of the
generalized plan itself. Additionally, we extend the Python debugging phase
with a reflection step prompting the LLM to pinpoint the reason for the
observed plan failure. Finally, we take inspiration from LLM code generation to
produce several program variants and pick the best one. Running experiments on
17 benchmark domains, we show that these extensions substantially improve (and
never deteriorate) the quality of the generalized plans. In 12 of the domains,
our best Python programs solve all tasks that can be generated with the
respective instance generator.

TL;DR: TS-Agent是一个模块化智能体框架，用于自动化金融时间序列建模工作流，通过三阶段迭代决策过程（模型选择、代码优化、微调）显著优于现有AutoML方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融时间序列建模需要高性能、可解释且可审计的模型，但现有AutoML框架缺乏对领域特定需求和动态目标的适应性。

Method: 采用模块化智能体框架，包含规划器智能体和结构化知识库，通过三阶段迭代决策过程（模型选择、代码优化、微调）进行建模。

Result: 在多样化金融预测和合成数据生成任务中，TS-Agent持续优于最先进的AutoML和智能体基线，实现了更高的准确性、鲁棒性和决策可追溯性。

Conclusion: TS-Agent框架为金融时间序列建模提供了自适应学习、强大调试和透明审计能力，满足了高风险环境的关键需求。

Abstract: Time-series data is central to decision-making in financial markets, yet
building high-performing, interpretable, and auditable models remains a major
challenge. While Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) frameworks streamline
model development, they often lack adaptability and responsiveness to
domain-specific needs and evolving objectives. Concurrently, Large Language
Models (LLMs) have enabled agentic systems capable of reasoning, memory
management, and dynamic code generation, offering a path toward more flexible
workflow automation. In this paper, we introduce \textsf{TS-Agent}, a modular
agentic framework designed to automate and enhance time-series modeling
workflows for financial applications. The agent formalizes the pipeline as a
structured, iterative decision process across three stages: model selection,
code refinement, and fine-tuning, guided by contextual reasoning and
experimental feedback. Central to our architecture is a planner agent equipped
with structured knowledge banks, curated libraries of models and refinement
strategies, which guide exploration, while improving interpretability and
reducing error propagation. \textsf{TS-Agent} supports adaptive learning,
robust debugging, and transparent auditing, key requirements for high-stakes
environments such as financial services. Empirical evaluations on diverse
financial forecasting and synthetic data generation tasks demonstrate that
\textsf{TS-Agent} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AutoML and agentic
baselines, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and decision traceability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI代理在供应链中表现出'合作悖论'：理论上更优的协作型AI代理比非AI基准表现更差，原因是库存囤积导致系统崩溃。通过高层AI策略设定和低层协作执行的结合才能实现稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI驱动代理在经济环境中的涌现战略行为，特别是在多级供应链这种容易出现牛鞭效应等不稳定性的合作环境中。

Method: 使用基于大语言模型的生成式AI代理在受控供应链模拟中进行计算实验，设计包含供应商管理库存原则的协作型AI代理。

Result: 发现'合作悖论'现象，协作型AI代理表现比非AI基准更差；通过高层AI策略设定和低层协作执行相结合的方法实现了系统稳定性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了协作型AI代理的涌现行为特征，为设计稳定有效的AI驱动商业分析系统提供了蓝图，强调需要分层策略来确保系统韧性。

Abstract: The rise of autonomous, AI-driven agents in economic settings raises critical
questions about their emergent strategic behavior. This paper investigates
these dynamics in the cooperative context of a multi-echelon supply chain, a
system famously prone to instabilities like the bullwhip effect. We conduct
computational experiments with generative AI agents, powered by Large Language
Models (LLMs), within a controlled supply chain simulation designed to isolate
their behavioral tendencies. Our central finding is the "collaboration
paradox": a novel, catastrophic failure mode where theoretically superior
collaborative AI agents, designed with Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI)
principles, perform even worse than non-AI baselines. We demonstrate that this
paradox arises from an operational flaw where agents hoard inventory, starving
the system. We then show that resilience is only achieved through a synthesis
of two distinct layers: high-level, AI-driven proactive policy-setting to
establish robust operational targets, and a low-level, collaborative execution
protocol with proactive downstream replenishment to maintain stability. Our
final framework, which implements this synthesis, can autonomously generate,
evaluate, and quantify a portfolio of viable strategic choices. The work
provides a crucial insight into the emergent behaviors of collaborative AI
agents and offers a blueprint for designing stable, effective AI-driven systems
for business analytics.

TL;DR: 使用大语言模型精细化和定制技术，将LLMs转化为帮助专家使用PyChrono模拟工具的虚拟助手，生成从简单到复杂的模拟脚本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低专家使用PyChrono等模拟工具的门槛，利用AI技术提高模拟脚本生成的质量和效率。

Method: 提出一个框架，通过精细化和定制各类开源和闭源LLMs，使其能够生成PyChrono虚拟实验脚本，并能回答API相关问题和推荐建模方法。

Result: 精细化后的LLMs在生成PyChrono模拟脚本质量上有显著提升，虽然并非完美，但能作为良好的起点基础。该框架具有普遍适用性。

Conclusion: 通过LLMs精细化技术可以有效降低模拟工具的使用门槛，为专家提供强大的虚拟助手支持，该方法可扩展到其他应用领域。

Abstract: This contribution is concerned with the following issue: can pretrained large
language models (LLMs) be refined and customized to the point where they become
virtual assistants helping experts with the effective use of a simulation tool?
In this case study, the ``simulation tool'' considered is PyChrono, an open
source multi-physics dynamics engine for multibody systems. We present a
framework for refining and customizing both open- and closed-source LLMs to
harness the power of AI in generating scripts that perform PyChrono virtual
experiments. We refine and customize several classes of LLMs through a process
that leads to a quantifiable improvement in the quality of the generated
PyChrono simulation scripts. These scripts can range from simple
single-pendulum simulations to complex virtual experiments involving full
vehicles on deformable terrain. While the generated scripts are rarely perfect,
they often serve as strong starting points for the user to modify and improve
on. Additionally, the LLM can answer specific API questions about the
simulator, or recommend modeling approaches. The framework discussed is general
and can be applied to lower the entry barrier for simulation tools associated
with other application domains.

Motivation: LRS问题是一个来自生物信息学的NP难组合优化问题，在基因组重新组装中发挥重要作用，需要高效的解决方案

Method: 采用偏向随机键遗传算法(BRKGA)，重点关注个体评估的计算效率（将灰度值向量转换为有效解），并与Max-Min蚂蚁系统和CPLEX整数规划汇比较

Result: 实验结果显示BRKGA在LRS问题上达到了当前最先进水平，是一种state-of-the-art技术

Conclusion: 虽然BRKGA表现优异，但在处理基于大字母表大小的输入字符串时仍有改进空间

Abstract: The longest run subsequence (LRS) problem is an NP-hard combinatorial
optimization problem belonging to the class of subsequence problems from
bioinformatics. In particular, the problem plays a role in genome reassembly.
In this paper, we present a solution to the LRS problem using a Biased Random
Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA). Our approach places particular focus on the
computational efficiency of evaluating individuals, which involves converting
vectors of gray values into valid solutions to the problem. For comparison
purposes, a Max-Min Ant System is developed and implemented. This is in
addition to the application of the integer linear programming solver CPLEX for
solving all considered problem instances. The computation results show that the
proposed BRKGA is currently a state-of-the-art technique for the LRS problem.
Nevertheless, the results also show that there is room for improvement,
especially in the context of input strings based on large alphabet sizes.

Motivation: 解决机器代理在人类为中心的桌面环境中操作时的固有失配问题，并克服端到端强化学习训练在扩展性和稳定性方面的挑战。

Method: 开发分布式RL基础设施支持数千个并行虚拟桌面环境，提出Entropulse训练策略（RL与监督微调交替），在GLM-4-9B-0414和Qwen2.5-14B模型上实施。

Result: 基于GLM-4-9B-0414的AutoGLM-OS-9B在OSWorld基准测试中达到48.1%的最新准确率，显著提升了桌面自动化通用代理的性能。

Conclusion: ComputerRL框架通过创新的API-GUI范式和可扩展的训练基础设施，成功实现了桌面环境中的自主智能操作，为桌面自动化领域带来了重要突破。

Abstract: We introduce ComputerRL, a framework for autonomous desktop intelligence that
enables agents to operate complex digital workspaces skillfully. ComputerRL
features the API-GUI paradigm, which unifies programmatic API calls and direct
GUI interaction to address the inherent mismatch between machine agents and
human-centric desktop environments. Scaling end-to-end RL training is crucial
for improvement and generalization across diverse desktop tasks, yet remains
challenging due to environmental inefficiency and instability in extended
training. To support scalable and robust training, we develop a distributed RL
infrastructure capable of orchestrating thousands of parallel virtual desktop
environments to accelerate large-scale online RL. Furthermore, we propose
Entropulse, a training strategy that alternates reinforcement learning with
supervised fine-tuning, effectively mitigating entropy collapse during extended
training runs. We employ ComputerRL on open models GLM-4-9B-0414 and
Qwen2.5-14B, and evaluate them on the OSWorld benchmark. The AutoGLM-OS-9B
based on GLM-4-9B-0414 achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 48.1%,
demonstrating significant improvements for general agents in desktop
automation. The algorithm and framework are adopted in building AutoGLM (Liu et
al., 2024a)

TL;DR: CT-CRS是一个对话推荐系统框架，通过消费者类型建模和逆强化学习来提升推荐准确性和交互效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话推荐系统忽视了用户的异质性决策风格和知识水平，限制了系统的准确性和效率

Method: 基于消费者类型理论定义四类用户，使用大语言模型实时推断用户类型，设计类型自适应策略，并采用逆强化学习优化对话策略

Result: 在LastFM、Amazon-Book和Yelp数据集上，CT-CRS提高了推荐成功率并减少了交互轮次

Conclusion: CT-CRS通过心理建模和策略优化的结合，为对话推荐系统提供了可扩展且可解释的个性化解决方案

Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS) provide personalized services
through multi-turn interactions, yet most existing methods overlook users'
heterogeneous decision-making styles and knowledge levels, which constrains
both accuracy and efficiency. To address this gap, we propose CT-CRS (Consumer
Type-Enhanced Conversational Recommender System), a framework that integrates
consumer type modeling into dialogue recommendation. Based on consumer type
theory, we define four user categories--dependent, efficient, cautious, and
expert--derived from two dimensions: decision-making style (maximizers vs.
satisficers) and knowledge level (high vs. low). CT-CRS employs interaction
histories and fine-tunes the large language model to automatically infer user
types in real time, avoiding reliance on static questionnaires. We incorporate
user types into state representation and design a type-adaptive policy that
dynamically adjusts recommendation granularity, diversity, and attribute query
complexity. To further optimize the dialogue policy, we adopt Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (IRL), enabling the agent to approximate expert-like
strategies conditioned on consumer type. Experiments on LastFM, Amazon-Book,
and Yelp show that CTCRS improves recommendation success rate and reduces
interaction turns compared to strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm that
both consumer type modeling and IRL contribute significantly to performance
gains. These results demonstrate that CT-CRS offers a scalable and
interpretable solution for enhancing CRS personalization through the
integration of psychological modeling and advanced policy optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂技术场景中的应用日益广泛，需要专门的检索解决方案来提升copilot系统的检索效果

Method: 采用两阶段框架：离线阶段从用户反馈和文档生成的问题中获取指标并分散存储；在线阶段使用双轨排名机制结合原始相似度分数和收集的指标

Result: 在真实环境评估中，FLAIR在已见和未见查询上都表现出显著性能提升，超越了最先进方法，已在微软服务数千用户

Conclusion: FLAIR框架通过迭代反馈学习有效提升了检索性能，证明了其在操作环境中的可扩展性和有效性

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven the adoption of
copilots in complex technical scenarios, underscoring the growing need for
specialized information retrieval solutions. In this paper, we introduce FLAIR,
a lightweight, feedback learning framework that adapts copilot systems'
retrieval strategies by integrating domain-specific expert feedback. FLAIR
operates in two stages: an offline phase obtains indicators from (1) user
feedback and (2) questions synthesized from documentation, storing these
indicators in a decentralized manner. An online phase then employs a two-track
ranking mechanism to combine raw similarity scores with the collected
indicators. This iterative setup refines retrieval performance for any query.
Extensive real-world evaluations of FLAIR demonstrate significant performance
gains on both previously seen and unseen queries, surpassing state-of-the-art
approaches. The system has been successfully integrated into Copilot DECO,
serving thousands of users at Microsoft, demonstrating its scalability and
effectiveness in operational environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学文献的指数增长使研究人员难以跟进文献，需要更有效的检索方法来缓解这一问题。

Method: 使用标记和关键词作为稀疏嵌入空间的表征单元，通过学术引用（标题、引用上下文、作者指定关键词、共引用）挖掘训练数据。

Result: 在8个科学检索基准上超过了强劲的浓密和稀疏检索基线模型，同时在关键词生成任务中达到了与CopyRNN相当的性能，但产生更多样化的关键词且速度提升4倍。

Conclusion: CASPER模型通过结合细粒度和概念层面的匹配，以及利用学术引用信息挖掘训练数据，为科学文献检索提供了一种高效的解决方案，同时具备多重应用潜力。

Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific literature has made it increasingly
difficult for researchers to keep up with the literature. In an attempt to
alleviate this problem, we propose CASPER, a sparse retrieval model for
scientific search that utilizes tokens and keyphrases as representation units
(i.e. dimensions in the sparse embedding space), enabling it to represent
queries and documents with research concepts and match them at both granular
and conceptual levels. To overcome the lack of suitable training data, we
propose mining training data by leveraging scholarly references (i.e. signals
that capture how research concepts of papers are expressed in different
settings), including titles, citation contexts, author-assigned keyphrases, and
co-citations. CASPER outperforms strong dense and sparse retrieval baselines on
eight scientific retrieval benchmarks. Moreover, we demonstrate that through
simple post-processing, CASPER can be effectively used for the keyphrase
generation tasks, achieving competitive performance with the established
CopyRNN while producing more diverse keyphrases and being nearly four times
faster.

Motivation: 解决对话推荐系统中代理系统响应延迟高的问题，在复杂查询处理和低延迟之间找到平衡

Method: 使用用户查询复杂度识别机制，简单查询直接调用工具快速响应，复杂查询通过记忆处理模块过滤聊天历史，智能任务分解规划器分解任务，最后使用个性化推荐工具执行

Result: 在沃尔玛真实职业推荐场景中，相比竞争基线平均响应延迟降低53.3%，同时显著提高推荐准确性

Conclusion: AdaptJobRec成功实现了在保持推荐质量的同时显著降低响应延迟，为对话推荐系统的实用化提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: In recent years, recommendation systems have evolved from providing a single
list of recommendations to offering a comprehensive suite of topic focused
services. To better accomplish this task, conversational recommendation systems
(CRS) have progressed from basic retrieval augmented LLM generation to agentic
systems with advanced reasoning and self correction capabilities. However,
agentic systems come with notable response latency, a longstanding challenge
for conversational recommendation systems. To balance the trade off between
handling complex queries and minimizing latency, we propose AdaptJobRec, the
first conversational job recommendation system that leverages autonomous agent
to integrate personalized recommendation algorithm tools. The system employs a
user query complexity identification mechanism to minimize response latency.
For straightforward queries, the agent directly selects the appropriate tool
for rapid responses. For complex queries, the agent uses the memory processing
module to filter chat history for relevant content, then passes the results to
the intelligent task decomposition planner, and finally executes the tasks
using personalized recommendation tools. Evaluation on Walmart's real world
career recommendation scenarios demonstrates that AdaptJobRec reduces average
response latency by up to 53.3% compared to competitive baselines, while
significantly improving recommendation accuracy.

TL;DR: L3AE是首个将大语言模型(LLMs)集成到线性自编码器框架中的推荐系统模型，通过两阶段优化策略有效整合文本语义和用户-物品交互信息，在三个基准数据集上显著优于现有LLM增强模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的线性自编码器在结合文本信息时依赖稀疏的词共现模式，无法充分捕捉丰富的文本语义信息，限制了推荐系统的性能提升。

Method: 采用两阶段优化策略：1) 从LLM生成的物品表示构建语义物品相关性矩阵；2) 从协同信号学习物品权重矩阵，同时将语义物品相关性作为正则化项。每个阶段都通过闭式解进行优化。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，L3AE相比最先进的LLM增强模型，Recall@20提升27.6%，NDCG@20提升39.3%。

Conclusion: L3AE成功将LLMs集成到线性自编码器框架中，通过有效的异构知识整合和闭式优化策略，显著提升了推荐系统的性能表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted to enrich the semantic
representation of textual item information in recommender systems. However,
existing linear autoencoders (LAEs) that incorporate textual information rely
on sparse word co-occurrence patterns, limiting their ability to capture rich
textual semantics. To address this, we propose L3AE, the first integration of
LLMs into the LAE framework. L3AE effectively integrates the heterogeneous
knowledge of textual semantics and user-item interactions through a two-phase
optimization strategy. (i) L3AE first constructs a semantic item-to-item
correlation matrix from LLM-derived item representations. (ii) It then learns
an item-to-item weight matrix from collaborative signals while distilling
semantic item correlations as regularization. Notably, each phase of L3AE is
optimized through closed-form solutions, ensuring global optimality and
computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that L3AE
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-enhanced models on three
benchmark datasets, achieving gains of 27.6% in Recall@20 and 39.3% in NDCG@20.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐方法只关注互动意愿，而影响力最大化方法忽略互动意愿，需要解决这两类方法的局限性

Method: HeteroIR采用两阶段框架估计传播收益，HeteroIM基于反向可达集增量选择最有影响力的被邀请者并进行重排序

Result: 实验显示显著优于现有基线方法(p值<0.05)，在线A/B测试分别获得8.5%和10%的提升

Conclusion: 所提模型成功解决了推荐系统中传播能力与互动意愿的平衡问题，在实际部署中验证了有效性

Abstract: User recommendation systems enhance user engagement by encouraging users to
act as inviters to interact with other users (invitees), potentially fostering
information propagation. Conventional recommendation methods typically focus on
modeling interaction willingness. Influence-Maximization (IM) methods focus on
identifying a set of users to maximize the information propagation. However,
existing methods face two significant challenges. First, recommendation methods
fail to unleash the candidates' spread capability. Second, IM methods fail to
account for the willingness to interact. To solve these issues, we propose two
models named HeteroIR and HeteroIM. HeteroIR provides an intuitive solution to
unleash the dissemination potential of user recommendation systems. HeteroIM
fills the gap between the IM method and the recommendation task, improving
interaction willingness and maximizing spread coverage. The HeteroIR introduces
a two-stage framework to estimate the spread profits. The HeteroIM
incrementally selects the most influential invitee to recommend and rerank
based on the number of reverse reachable (RR) sets containing inviters and
invitees. RR set denotes a set of nodes that can reach a target via
propagation. Extensive experiments show that HeteroIR and HeteroIM
significantly outperform the state-of-the-art baselines with the p-value <
0.05. Furthermore, we have deployed HeteroIR and HeteroIM in Tencent's online
gaming platforms and gained an 8.5\% and 10\% improvement in the online A/B
test, respectively. Implementation codes are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长序列建模中破坏了两个基本要求：充分利用完整序列信息和保持行为与目标项的高相关性，导致在线系统性能受限。

Method: 两阶段方法：离线阶段使用基于度量学习的降维算法聚类整个行为序列提取兴趣；在线阶段使用现成用户兴趣预测与目标项的关联，并在整个流程中采用相同的相关性度量。

Result: 与最先进方法的广泛实验比较证明了ENCODE的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: ENCODE不仅满足长序列建模的两个基本要求，还实现了在线服务效率与精度的理想平衡。

Abstract: Long-term user behavior sequences are a goldmine for businesses to explore
users' interests to improve Click-Through Rate. However, it is very challenging
to accurately capture users' long-term interests from their long-term behavior
sequences and give quick responses from the online serving systems. To meet
such requirements, existing methods "inadvertently" destroy two basic
requirements in long-term sequence modeling: R1) make full use of the entire
sequence to keep the information as much as possible; R2) extract information
from the most relevant behaviors to keep high relevance between learned
interests and current target items. The performance of online serving systems
is significantly affected by incomplete and inaccurate user interest
information obtained by existing methods. To this end, we propose an efficient
two-stage long-term sequence modeling approach, named as EfficieNt Clustering
based twO-stage interest moDEling (ENCODE), consisting of offline extraction
stage and online inference stage. It not only meets the aforementioned two
basic requirements but also achieves a desirable balance between online service
efficiency and precision. Specifically, in the offline extraction stage, ENCODE
clusters the entire behavior sequence and extracts accurate interests. To
reduce the overhead of the clustering process, we design a metric
learning-based dimension reduction algorithm that preserves the relative
pairwise distances of behaviors in the new feature space. While in the online
inference stage, ENCODE takes the off-the-shelf user interests to predict the
associations with target items. Besides, to further ensure the relevance
between user interests and target items, we adopt the same relevance metric
throughout the whole pipeline of ENCODE. The extensive experiment and
comparison with SOTA have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of our
proposed ENCODE.

TL;DR: 传统推荐系统存在忽略用户次要兴趣领域的问题，校准推荐系统通过保证推荐列表包含代表性不足的领域来解决这个问题，使用三维分布模型进行评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐系统倾向于推荐与用户主要兴趣最相关的项目，忽略了用户次要兴趣领域，这会降低用户体验。需要一种方法来保证推荐列表的多样性。

Method: 采用校准推荐系统，处理三种G维分布（用户档案分布、候选项目分布、推荐列表分布），实现15个模型来分析这些分布结构，在三个电影数据集上评估用户模式。

Result: 异常检测模型能更好地理解分布结构，校准系统创建的推荐列表与传统推荐列表表现相似，但允许用户同等程度地改变偏好组。

Conclusion: 校准推荐系统能有效解决传统推荐系统忽略次要兴趣领域的问题，通过多维分布分析提供更平衡的推荐体验。

Abstract: Traditional recommender systems aim to generate a recommendation list
comprising the most relevant or similar items to the user's profile. These
approaches can create recommendation lists that omit item genres from the less
prominent areas of a user's profile, thereby undermining the user's experience.
To solve this problem, the calibrated recommendation system provides a
guarantee of including less representative areas in the recommended list. The
calibrated context works with three distributions. The first is from the user's
profile, the second is from the candidate items, and the last is from the
recommendation list. These distributions are G-dimensional, where G is the
total number of genres in the system. This high dimensionality requires a
different evaluation method, considering that traditional recommenders operate
in a one-dimensional data space. In this sense, we implement fifteen models
that help to understand how these distributions are structured. We evaluate the
users' patterns in three datasets from the movie domain. The results indicate
that the models of outlier detection provide a better understanding of the
structures. The calibrated system creates recommendation lists that act
similarly to traditional recommendation lists, allowing users to change their
groups of preferences to the same degree.

TL;DR: 提出了MUFFIN模型，通过全局和局部频率滤波模块结合用户自适应滤波，解决了现有频域序列推荐模型频率覆盖范围有限和缺乏个性化频率过滤的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有频域序列推荐模型存在两个主要缺陷：频率覆盖范围有限，可能错过特定频率范围内的关键行为模式；缺乏个性化频率过滤，对所有用户使用相同的滤波器而忽略了用户独特的频率特征。

Method: 提出MUFFIN模型，包含两个互补模块：全局滤波模块(GFM)处理整个频率谱以捕获全面的行为模式；局部滤波模块(LFM)选择性强调重要频段而不排除其他范围的信息；两个模块都采用用户自适应滤波器(UAF)生成针对个体独特特征的用户特定频率滤波器。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，MUFFIN始终优于最先进的频域序列推荐模型。

Conclusion: MUFFIN通过聚合两个模块，能够捕获用户在整个频率谱上的多样化行为模式，有效解决了现有频域序列推荐模型的局限性。

Abstract: Sequential recommendation (SR) aims to predict users' subsequent interactions
by modeling their sequential behaviors. Recent studies have explored frequency
domain analysis, which effectively models periodic patterns in user sequences.
However, existing frequency-domain SR models still face two major drawbacks:
(i) limited frequency band coverage, often missing critical behavioral patterns
in a specific frequency range, and (ii) lack of personalized frequency
filtering, as they apply an identical filter for all users regardless of their
distinct frequency characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel frequency-domain model, Mixture of User-adaptive Frequency FIlteriNg
(MUFFIN), operating through two complementary modules. (i) The global filtering
module (GFM) handles the entire frequency spectrum to capture comprehensive
behavioral patterns. (ii) The local filtering module (LFM) selectively
emphasizes important frequency bands without excluding information from other
ranges. (iii) In both modules, the user-adaptive filter (UAF) is adopted to
generate user-specific frequency filters tailored to individual unique
characteristics. Finally, by aggregating both modules, MUFFIN captures diverse
user behavioral patterns across the full frequency spectrum. Extensive
experiments show that MUFFIN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
frequency-domain SR models over five benchmark datasets. The source code is

TL;DR: REARM框架通过改进多模态对比学习和同构图关系来解决多模态推荐系统中的数据稀疏问题，提升推荐性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理稀疏数据时存在两个主要限制：1）简单的多模态特征对比无法产生有效表示，导致模态共享特征噪声和模态独特特征信息丢失；2）缺乏对用户兴趣和物品共现同构关系的探索，导致用户-物品交互挖掘不完整

Method: 提出REARM框架，使用元网络和正交约束策略来过滤模态共享特征中的噪声并保留模态独特特征中的推荐相关信息；整合新构建的用户兴趣图和物品共现图与现有用户共现图和物品语义图进行图学习

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的广泛实验表明REARM优于各种最先进的基线方法，可视化显示REARM在区分模态共享和模态独特特征方面有所改进

Conclusion: REARM通过改进的多模态对比学习和同构图关系挖掘，有效解决了多模态推荐系统中的数据稀疏问题，显著提升了推荐性能

Abstract: Multi-modal recommender system focuses on utilizing rich modal information (
i.e., images and textual descriptions) of items to improve recommendation
performance. The current methods have achieved remarkable success with the
powerful structure modeling capability of graph neural networks. However, these
methods are often hindered by sparse data in real-world scenarios. Although
contrastive learning and homography ( i.e., homogeneous graphs) are employed to
address the data sparsity challenge, existing methods still suffer two main
limitations: 1) Simple multi-modal feature contrasts fail to produce effective
representations, causing noisy modal-shared features and loss of valuable
information in modal-unique features; 2) The lack of exploration of the
homograph relations between user interests and item co-occurrence results in
incomplete mining of user-item interplay.
  To address the above limitations, we propose a novel framework for
\textbf{R}\textbf{E}fining multi-mod\textbf{A}l cont\textbf{R}astive learning
and ho\textbf{M}ography relations (\textbf{REARM}). Specifically, we complement
multi-modal contrastive learning by employing meta-network and orthogonal
constraint strategies, which filter out noise in modal-shared features and
retain recommendation-relevant information in modal-unique features. To mine
homogeneous relationships effectively, we integrate a newly constructed user
interest graph and an item co-occurrence graph with the existing user
co-occurrence and item semantic graphs for graph learning. The extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of REARM
to various state-of-the-art baselines. Our visualization further shows an
improvement made by REARM in distinguishing between modal-shared and
modal-unique features. Code is available

Method: 提出灵活架构（新颖的门控多模态编码器，使用自适应融合机制处理缺失模态），开发综合训练策略（结合跨模态对齐损失、局部对齐损失、模态内对比损失和自适应损失加权），并创建M-BEER基准数据集。

Result: 在四个电商基准测试中持续优于现有方法，在M-BEER基准上跨模态任务提升显著（文本到图像检索R@10提升28%），参数效率高（0.2B参数），实际部署中点击率提升2.74%，收入提升8.33%。

Conclusion: UniECS在实验和实际环境中都证明了其有效性，为电商多模态检索提供了统一的解决方案，代码、模型和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Current e-commerce multimodal retrieval systems face two key limitations:
they optimize for specific tasks with fixed modality pairings, and lack
comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating unified retrieval approaches. To
address these challenges, we introduce UniECS, a unified multimodal e-commerce
search framework that handles all retrieval scenarios across image, text, and
their combinations. Our work makes three key contributions. First, we propose a
flexible architecture with a novel gated multimodal encoder that uses adaptive
fusion mechanisms. This encoder integrates different modality representations
while handling missing modalities. Second, we develop a comprehensive training
strategy to optimize learning. It combines cross-modal alignment loss (CMAL),
cohesive local alignment loss (CLAL), intra-modal contrastive loss (IMCL), and
adaptive loss weighting. Third, we create M-BEER, a carefully curated
multimodal benchmark containing 50K product pairs for e-commerce search
evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniECS consistently
outperforms existing methods across four e-commerce benchmarks with fine-tuning
or zero-shot evaluation. On our M-BEER bench, UniECS achieves substantial
improvements in cross-modal tasks (up to 28\% gain in R@10 for text-to-image
retrieval) while maintaining parameter efficiency (0.2B parameters) compared to
larger models like GME-Qwen2VL (2B) and MM-Embed (8B). Furthermore, we deploy
UniECS in the e-commerce search platform of Kuaishou Inc. across two search
scenarios, achieving notable improvements in Click-Through Rate (+2.74\%) and
Revenue (+8.33\%). The comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness
of our approach in both experimental and real-world settings. Corresponding
codes, models and datasets will be made publicly available at

Motivation: 应对极端气候事件，传统的可持续行为改变方法要求过高或只能被动参与，需要更主动的推动方式

Method: 设计GRAPE推荐系统，优先推荐符合用户变化偏好的可持续食物选项；创建两种绿色损失函数（均匀优先级和差异化优先级）以适配不同场景

Result: 在真实数据集上进行了广泛实验，证明了GRAPE推荐系统的有效性

Conclusion: 通过推荐系统主动引导用户向可持续选择转变是一种有效方法，新设计的绿色损失函数提供了更好的适配性

Abstract: The recent emergence of extreme climate events has significantly raised
awareness about sustainable living. In addition to developing energy-saving
materials and technologies, existing research mainly relies on traditional
methods that encourage behavioral shifts towards sustainability, which can be
overly demanding or only passively engaging. In this work, we propose to employ
recommendation systems to actively nudge users toward more sustainable choices.
We introduce Green Recommender Aligned with Personalized Eating (GRAPE), which
is designed to prioritize and recommend sustainable food options that align
with users' evolving preferences. We also design two innovative Green Loss
functions that cater to green indicators with either uniform or differentiated
priorities, thereby enhancing adaptability across a range of scenarios.
Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of
our GRAPE.

TL;DR: CARE框架将大语言模型与外部推荐系统结合，通过实体级洞察和上下文信息增强对话推荐系统的准确性和减少偏差


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前基于LLM的对话推荐系统面临的两个主要挑战：缺乏领域专业知识导致推荐不准确，以及过度依赖对话上下文而忽视协作关系

Method: 提出CARE框架，集成外部推荐系统作为领域专家提供实体级推荐，并利用LLM基于上下文信息进行候选项目选择和重排序

Result: 在ReDial和INSPIRED数据集上，推荐准确率分别平均提升54%和25%，有效缓解了外部推荐系统的流行度偏差

Conclusion: CARE框架成功解决了LLM在对话推荐中的局限性，通过结合外部推荐系统和上下文信息显著提升了推荐性能

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of integrating large language models (LLMs) with
external recommender systems to enhance domain expertise in conversational
recommendation (CRS). Current LLM-based CRS approaches primarily rely on zero-
or few-shot methods for generating item recommendations based on user queries,
but this method faces two significant challenges: (1) without domain-specific
adaptation, LLMs frequently recommend items not in the target item space,
resulting in low recommendation accuracy; and (2) LLMs largely rely on dialogue
context for content-based recommendations, neglecting the collaborative
relationships among entities or item sequences. To address these limitations,
we introduce the CARE (Contextual Adaptation of Recommenders) framework. CARE
customizes LLMs for CRS tasks, and synergizes them with external recommendation
systems. CARE (a) integrates external recommender systems as domain experts,
producing recommendations through entity-level insights, and (b) enhances those
recommendations by leveraging contextual information for more accurate and
unbiased final recommendations using LLMs. Our results demonstrate that
incorporating external recommender systems with entity-level information
significantly enhances recommendation accuracy of LLM-based CRS by an average
of 54% and 25% for ReDial and INSPIRED datasets. The most effective strategy in
the CARE framework involves LLMs selecting and reranking candidate items that
external recommenders provide based on contextual insights. Our analysis
indicates that the CARE framework effectively addresses the identified
challenges and mitigates the popularity bias in the external recommender.

Motivation: 为了提升神经信息检索中合成查询生成流程的效果，解决原有方法中过于依赖激进过滤的问题，并提供可复现的端到端框架。

Method: 使用InPars工具包重现原有流氵线，然后提出两个关键扩展：1）通过对比偏好优化（CPO）细调查询生成器；2）使用DSPy框架将静态提示替换为动态的思维链优化提示。

Result: 两种扩展方法都能在减少激进过滤的同时提升检索性能，在SciFact标准数据集上验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 通过CPO细调和动态CoT提示策略，可以显著提升合成查询的质量和检索效果，为神经信息检索领域提供了更有效的训练数据生成方法。

Abstract: This work revisits and extends synthetic query generation pipelines for
Neural Information Retrieval (NIR) by leveraging the InPars Toolkit, a
reproducible, end-to-end framework for generating training data using large
language models (LLMs). We first assess the reproducibility of the original
InPars, InPars-V2, and Promptagator pipelines on the SciFact benchmark and
validate their effectiveness using open-source reranker and generator models.
Building on this foundation, we introduce two key extensions to the pipeline:
(1) fine-tuning a query generator LLM via Contrastive Preference Optimization
(CPO) to improve the signal quality in generated queries, and (2) replacing
static prompt templates with dynamic, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) optimized prompts
using the DSPy framework. Our results show that both extensions reduce the need
for aggressive filtering while improving retrieval performance. All code,
models, and synthetic datasets are publicly released to support further

TL;DR: 提出A2CG框架，在新闻推荐系统的最早阶段引入多样性，通过向量量化变分自编码器和可配置机制实现个性化与多样性的灵活权衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于点击历史的新闻推荐系统以用户参与度为代价限制了内容多样性，且现有多样性算法存在两个主要局限：无法考虑规范性多样性（要求公平获取广泛视角），以及通常在系统流水线后期才应用多样性

Method: 使用Aspect-Aware Candidate Generation (A2CG)框架，通过VQ-VAE创建离散的多方面表示，使用解码器模型学习用户偏好，在候选检索过程中通过反转查询向量的某些方面来直接注入多样性

Result: 在MIND数据集上的评估显示，该方法能够在推荐流水线早期实现个性化与多样性的灵活权衡，生成更新颖、多样和意外发现的候选内容，同时有效考虑加强民主价值的方面

Conclusion: A2CG是一个有前景的方法，可用于下游民主化新闻推荐系统，能够促进真正的规范性多样性

Abstract: Current News Recommender Systems based on past clicks are designed for
engagement, but come at the cost of limiting diversity in the suggested
content. While diversity-aware algorithms exist, they suffer from two major
limitations. First, they fail to account for normative diversity, which
requires fair access to a broad range of perspectives. Second, they typically
apply diversity late in the system's pipeline, after a lot of content has
already been filtered out. Both limitations confine their effectiveness and
prevent them from promoting true normative diversity in news recommendations.
  We propose Aspect-Aware Candidate Generation (A2CG) to address these
limitations. Our framework introduces diversity into the earliest pipeline
stage and uses a configurable mechanism to align diversity with specific
democratic goals. A2CG represents each news article using multiple aspects of
perspectives (e.g., sentiment, political leaning, frame) and uses a Vector
Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to create a discrete, multi-faceted
representation. A decoder-only model then learns user preferences over these
aspect codes. We then inject diversity directly by reversing the sign on some
of the query vector's aspects during the candidate retrieval process, ensuring
a more diverse set of candidates.
  Our method, evaluated on the MIND dataset, enables a flexible trade-off
between personalization and diversity early in the recommendation pipeline. It
also generates more novel, diverse, and serendipitous candidates while
effectively taking into account aspects that strengthen democratic values.
These empirical results make it a promising approach for downstream
democratized news recommendation systems.
