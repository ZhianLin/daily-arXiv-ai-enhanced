### [1] [Med-GRIM: Enhanced Zero-Shot Medical VQA using prompt-embedded Multimodal Graph RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06496)
*Rakesh Raj Madavan,Akshat Kaimal,Hashim Faisal,Chandrakala S*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BIND和Med-GRIM通过密集编码和模块化工作流程提升医疗VQA任务的精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态模型在复杂领域（如医疗VQA）中缺乏详细精度，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: BIND通过密集编码优化联合嵌入空间；Med-GRIM结合图检索和提示工程，使用小语言模型降低计算成本。

Result: Med-GRIM以低计算成本实现高性能，并发布DermaGraph数据集支持零样本研究。

Conclusion: 该方法为医疗VQA提供了高效、精确的解决方案，并推动了多模态医学研究。

Abstract: An ensemble of trained multimodal encoders and vision-language models (VLMs)
has become a standard approach for visual question answering (VQA) tasks.
However, such models often fail to produce responses with the detailed
precision necessary for complex, domain-specific applications such as medical
VQA. Our representation model, BIND: BLIVA Integrated with Dense Encoding,
extends prior multimodal work by refining the joint embedding space through
dense, query-token-based encodings inspired by contrastive pretraining
techniques. This refined encoder powers Med-GRIM, a model designed for medical
VQA tasks that leverages graph-based retrieval and prompt engineering to
integrate domain-specific knowledge. Rather than relying on compute-heavy
fine-tuning of vision and language models on specific datasets, Med-GRIM
applies a low-compute, modular workflow with small language models (SLMs) for
efficiency. Med-GRIM employs prompt-based retrieval to dynamically inject
relevant knowledge, ensuring both accuracy and robustness in its responses. By
assigning distinct roles to each agent within the VQA system, Med-GRIM achieves
large language model performance at a fraction of the computational cost.
Additionally, to support scalable research in zero-shot multimodal medical
applications, we introduce DermaGraph, a novel Graph-RAG dataset comprising
diverse dermatological conditions. This dataset facilitates both multimodal and
unimodal querying. The code and dataset are available at:

### [2] [DiTalker: A Unified DiT-based Framework for High-Quality and Speaking Styles Controllable Portrait Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06511)
*He Feng,Yongjia Ma,Donglin Di,Lei Fan,Tonghua Su,Xiangqian Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiTalker提出了一种基于DiT的框架，用于可控说话风格的肖像动画，解决了现有方法忽略动态风格（如头部运动）的问题，并通过模块化设计提升了唇同步和风格控制能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的肖像动画方法主要关注唇同步或静态情感转换，忽略了动态风格（如头部运动），且双U-Net架构带来额外计算开销。

Method: DiTalker设计了风格-情感编码模块（Style-Emotion Encoding Module）和音频-风格融合模块（Audio-Style Fusion Module），通过并行分支提取风格和情感特征，并采用优化约束提升唇同步和细节保留。

Result: 实验表明DiTalker在唇同步和说话风格可控性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DiTalker通过模块化设计和优化约束，实现了高质量的肖像动画，具有更好的唇同步和风格控制能力。

Abstract: Portrait animation aims to synthesize talking videos from a static reference
face, conditioned on audio and style frame cues (e.g., emotion and head poses),
while ensuring precise lip synchronization and faithful reproduction of
speaking styles. Existing diffusion-based portrait animation methods primarily
focus on lip synchronization or static emotion transformation, often
overlooking dynamic styles such as head movements. Moreover, most of these
methods rely on a dual U-Net architecture, which preserves identity consistency
but incurs additional computational overhead. To this end, we propose DiTalker,
a unified DiT-based framework for speaking style-controllable portrait
animation. We design a Style-Emotion Encoding Module that employs two separate
branches: a style branch extracting identity-specific style information (e.g.,
head poses and movements), and an emotion branch extracting identity-agnostic
emotion features. We further introduce an Audio-Style Fusion Module that
decouples audio and speaking styles via two parallel cross-attention layers,
using these features to guide the animation process. To enhance the quality of
results, we adopt and modify two optimization constraints: one to improve lip
synchronization and the other to preserve fine-grained identity and background
details. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DiTalker in terms
of lip synchronization and speaking style controllability. Project Page:

### [3] [BigTokDetect: A Clinically-Informed Vision-Language Model Framework for Detecting Pro-Bigorexia Videos on TikTok](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06515)
*Minh Duc Chu,Kshitij Pawar,Zihao He,Roxanna Sharifi,Ross Sonnenblick,Magdalayna Curry,Laura D'Adamo,Lindsay Young,Stuart B Murray,Kristina Lerman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出BigTokDetect框架，用于检测TikTok上促进肌肉畸形行为的危害内容，通过多模态方法显著提升检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上针对男性青少年的肌肉畸形行为内容（如pro-bigorexia）难以通过传统文本检测方法识别，因其伪装成健身内容。

Method: 开发BigTokDetect框架，基于专家标注的多模态数据集BigTok（2200+视频），结合视觉语言模型进行检测。

Result: 多模态融合方法在主要类别分类上达到82.9%准确率，比纯文本方法提升5-10%，视频特征最具区分性。

Conclusion: 研究为心理健康领域的有害内容检测提供了新基准和工具，支持可扩展的内容审核。

Abstract: Social media platforms increasingly struggle to detect harmful content that
promotes muscle dysmorphic behaviors, particularly pro-bigorexia content that
disproportionately affects adolescent males. Unlike traditional eating disorder
detection focused on the "thin ideal," pro-bigorexia material masquerades as
legitimate fitness content through complex multimodal combinations of visual
displays, coded language, and motivational messaging that evade text-based
detection systems. We address this challenge by developing BigTokDetect, a
clinically-informed detection framework for identifying pro-bigorexia content
on TikTok. We introduce BigTok, the first expert-annotated multimodal dataset
of over 2,200 TikTok videos labeled by clinical psychologists and psychiatrists
across five primary categories spanning body image, nutrition, exercise,
supplements, and masculinity. Through a comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art vision language models, we achieve 0.829% accuracy on primary
category classification and 0.690% on subcategory detection via domain-specific
finetuning. Our ablation studies demonstrate that multimodal fusion improves
performance by 5-10% over text-only approaches, with video features providing
the most discriminative signals. These findings establish new benchmarks for
multimodal harmful content detection and provide both the computational tools
and methodological framework needed for scalable content moderation in
specialized mental health domains.

### [4] [Frequency Prior Guided Matching: A Data Augmentation Approach for Generalizable Semi-Supervised Polyp Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06517)
*Haoran Xi,Chen Liu,Xiaolin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FPGM是一种基于频率先验的半监督学习方法，通过利用息肉边缘的频率特征，显著提升了跨域分割的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决息肉分割中标注数据不足和域适应性能下降的问题。

Method: 提出FPGM框架，通过两阶段学习域不变频率先验并对未标注图像进行频谱扰动。

Result: 在六个公开数据集上表现最优，零样本泛化能力提升10%以上。

Conclusion: FPGM为临床部署提供了高效的息肉分割解决方案。

Abstract: Automated polyp segmentation is essential for early diagnosis of colorectal
cancer, yet developing robust models remains challenging due to limited
annotated data and significant performance degradation under domain shift.
Although semi-supervised learning (SSL) reduces annotation requirements,
existing methods rely on generic augmentations that ignore polyp-specific
structural properties, resulting in poor generalization to new imaging centers
and devices. To address this, we introduce Frequency Prior Guided Matching
(FPGM), a novel augmentation framework built on a key discovery: polyp edges
exhibit a remarkably consistent frequency signature across diverse datasets.
FPGM leverages this intrinsic regularity in a two-stage process. It first
learns a domain-invariant frequency prior from the edge regions of labeled
polyps. Then, it performs principled spectral perturbations on unlabeled
images, aligning their amplitude spectra with this learned prior while
preserving phase information to maintain structural integrity. This targeted
alignment normalizes domain-specific textural variations, thereby compelling
the model to learn the underlying, generalizable anatomical structure.
Validated on six public datasets, FPGM establishes a new state-of-the-art
against ten competing methods. It demonstrates exceptional zero-shot
generalization capabilities, achieving over 10% absolute gain in Dice score in
data-scarce scenarios. By significantly enhancing cross-domain robustness, FPGM
presents a powerful solution for clinically deployable polyp segmentation under
limited supervision.

### [5] [Large Language Models Facilitate Vision Reflection in Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06525)
*Guoyuan An,JaeYoon Kim,SungEui Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出视觉反射在大型多模态模型（LMMs）中的可解释性新发现，包括通过验证提示提升识别精度、分析视觉反射行为及训练无关连接器的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LMMs在视觉任务中的表现及可解释性，尤其是视觉反射如何通过语言模型提升识别能力。

Method: 通过验证提示分析LMMs行为，研究视觉-语言连接器的作用，并测试训练无关连接器的性能。

Result: 验证提示提升识别精度；视觉反射依赖文本概念而非原始视觉特征；训练无关连接器在细粒度任务中有效。

Conclusion: 视觉反射为LMMs提供了鲁棒且可解释的视觉识别新策略。

Abstract: This paper presents several novel findings on the explainability of vision
reflection in large multimodal models (LMMs). First, we show that prompting an
LMM to verify the prediction of a specialized vision model can improve
recognition accuracy, even on benchmarks like ImageNet, despite prior evidence
that LMMs typically underperform dedicated vision encoders. Second, we analyze
the internal behavior of vision reflection and find that the vision-language
connector maps visual features into explicit textual concepts, allowing the
language model to reason about prediction plausibility using commonsense
knowledge. We further observe that replacing a large number of vision tokens
with only a few text tokens still enables LLaVA to generate similar answers,
suggesting that LMMs may rely primarily on a compact set of distilled textual
representations rather than raw vision features. Third, we show that a
training-free connector can enhance LMM performance in fine-grained recognition
tasks, without extensive feature-alignment training. Together, these findings
offer new insights into the explainability of vision-language models and
suggest that vision reflection is a promising strategy for achieving robust and
interpretable visual recognition.

### [6] [A Framework Combining 3D CNN and Transformer for Video-Based Behavior Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06528)
*Xiuliang Zhang,Tadiwa Elisha Nyamasvisva,Chuntao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合3D CNN和Transformer的混合框架，用于视频行为识别，解决了3D CNN的长距离依赖问题和Transformer的高计算成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频行为识别在公共安全、智能监控和人机交互中至关重要，但传统3D CNN难以建模长距离依赖，而Transformer计算成本高。

Method: 采用3D CNN提取低层次时空特征，Transformer捕获长距离时间依赖，并通过融合机制整合两者。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优于传统3D CNN和单独Transformer，识别精度更高且复杂度可控。

Conclusion: 混合框架为视频行为识别提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Video-based behavior recognition is essential in fields such as public
safety, intelligent surveillance, and human-computer interaction. Traditional
3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN) effectively capture local
spatiotemporal features but struggle with modeling long-range dependencies.
Conversely, Transformers excel at learning global contextual information but
face challenges with high computational costs. To address these limitations, we
propose a hybrid framework combining 3D CNN and Transformer architectures. The
3D CNN module extracts low-level spatiotemporal features, while the Transformer
module captures long-range temporal dependencies, with a fusion mechanism
integrating both representations. Evaluated on benchmark datasets, the proposed
model outperforms traditional 3D CNN and standalone Transformers, achieving
higher recognition accuracy with manageable complexity. Ablation studies
further validate the complementary strengths of the two modules. This hybrid
framework offers an effective and scalable solution for video-based behavior
recognition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RMT-PPAD是一种基于Transformer的实时多任务模型，用于自动驾驶感知任务，包括目标检测、可行驶区域分割和车道线分割。通过轻量级模块和自适应解码器优化性能，并在BDD100K数据集上取得SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统需要高精度和实时性的全景驾驶感知，现有方法在多任务协同和性能优化上存在不足。

Method: 提出RMT-PPAD模型，结合轻量级门控适配器融合共享与任务特定特征，设计自适应分割解码器，并解决车道线标签不一致问题。

Result: 在BDD100K数据集上，目标检测mAP50达84.9%，可行驶区域分割mIoU达92.6%，车道线分割IoU达56.8%，推理速度32.6 FPS。

Conclusion: RMT-PPAD在性能和实时性上表现优异，适用于实际自动驾驶场景，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems rely on panoptic driving perception that requires
both precision and real-time performance. In this work, we propose RMT-PPAD, a
real-time, transformer-based multi-task model that jointly performs object
detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line segmentation. We introduce
a lightweight module, a gate control with an adapter to adaptively fuse shared
and task-specific features, effectively alleviating negative transfer between
tasks. Additionally, we design an adaptive segmentation decoder to learn the
weights over multi-scale features automatically during the training stage. This
avoids the manual design of task-specific structures for different segmentation
tasks. We also identify and resolve the inconsistency between training and
testing labels in lane line segmentation. This allows fairer evaluation.
Experiments on the BDD100K dataset demonstrate that RMT-PPAD achieves
state-of-the-art results with mAP50 of 84.9% and Recall of 95.4% for object
detection, mIoU of 92.6% for drivable area segmentation, and IoU of 56.8% and
accuracy of 84.7% for lane line segmentation. The inference speed reaches 32.6
FPS. Moreover, we introduce real-world scenarios to evaluate RMT-PPAD
performance in practice. The results show that RMT-PPAD consistently delivers
stable performance. The source codes and pre-trained models are released at
https://github.com/JiayuanWang-JW/RMT-PPAD.

### [8] [What Makes "Good" Distractors for Object Hallucination Evaluation in Large Vision-Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06530)
*Ming-Kun Xie,Jia-Hao Xiao,Gang Niu,Lei Feng,Zhiqiang Kou,Min-Ling Zhang,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出HOPE基准，通过生成误导性干扰项更严格评估大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）的幻觉问题，显著优于现有POPE基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有POPE基准在评估LVLMs的物体幻觉问题时效果下降，因其采样策略简单且忽略图像特定信息。

Method: HOPE利用CLIP选择高预测似然的负对象作为干扰项，并通过真实对象与错误描述配对构造误导性干扰项。

Result: HOPE使多种先进LVLMs的精度下降9%-23%，显著优于POPE。

Conclusion: HOPE为评估LVLMs的幻觉免疫力提供了更严格的基准。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), empowered by the success of Large
Language Models (LLMs), have achieved impressive performance across domains.
Despite the great advances in LVLMs, they still suffer from the unavailable
object hallucination issue, which tends to generate objects inconsistent with
the image content. The most commonly used Polling-based Object Probing
Evaluation (POPE) benchmark evaluates this issue by sampling negative
categories according to category-level statistics, \textit{e.g.}, category
frequencies and co-occurrence. However, with the continuous advancement of
LVLMs, the POPE benchmark has shown diminishing effectiveness in assessing
object hallucination, as it employs a simplistic sampling strategy that
overlooks image-specific information and restricts distractors to negative
object categories only. In this paper, we introduce the Hallucination
searching-based Object Probing Evaluation (HOPE) benchmark, aiming to generate
the most misleading distractors (\textit{i.e.}, non-existent objects or
incorrect image descriptions) that can trigger hallucination in LVLMs, which
serves as a means to more rigorously assess their immunity to hallucination. To
explore the image-specific information, the content-aware hallucination
searching leverages Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) to
approximate the predictive behavior of LVLMs by selecting negative objects with
the highest predicted likelihood as distractors. To expand the scope of
hallucination assessment, the description-based hallucination searching
constructs highly misleading distractors by pairing true objects with false
descriptions. Experimental results show that HOPE leads to a precision drop of
at least 9\% and up to 23\% across various state-of-the-art LVLMs,
significantly outperforming POPE in exposing hallucination vulnerabilities. The
code is available at https://github.com/xiemk/HOPE.

TL;DR: 论文分析了智能手机天文摄影数据集MobilTelesco，评估了目标检测模型在稀疏特征条件下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有目标检测模型基于日常物体数据集（如ImageNet、COCO），缺乏对稀疏信号（如夜空图像）的适应性。

Method: 使用MobilTelesco数据集对多种检测模型进行基准测试。

Result: 揭示了模型在特征稀疏条件下的挑战。

Conclusion: MobilTelesco数据集填补了稀疏信号检测的空白，为模型优化提供了新方向。

Abstract: Object detection models are typically trained on datasets like ImageNet,
COCO, and PASCAL VOC, which focus on everyday objects. However, these lack
signal sparsity found in non-commercial domains. MobilTelesco, a
smartphone-based astrophotography dataset, addresses this by providing sparse
night-sky images. We benchmark several detection models on it, highlighting
challenges under feature-deficient conditions.

*Sihan Zhao,Zixuan Wang,Tianyu Luan,Jia Jia,Wentao Zhu,Jiebo Luo,Junsong Yuan,Nan Xi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种物理标注方法和PP-Motion指标，用于评估生成人体运动的物理和感知保真度，解决了现有方法在物理可行性和人类感知之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成人体运动的保真度评估是重要但复杂的任务，现有方法在物理可行性和人类感知之间存在差距，且人类感知标注主观且粗糙。

Method: 提出物理标注方法，计算运动与物理定律的最小修改量，生成细粒度连续标注；基于此提出PP-Motion指标，结合皮尔逊相关损失和人类感知损失。

Result: PP-Motion在实验中既符合物理定律，又比先前工作更符合人类对运动保真度的感知。

Conclusion: PP-Motion为生成人体运动的保真度评估提供了更全面、客观的解决方案。

Abstract: Human motion generation has found widespread applications in AR/VR, film,
sports, and medical rehabilitation, offering a cost-effective alternative to
traditional motion capture systems. However, evaluating the fidelity of such
generated motions is a crucial, multifaceted task. Although previous approaches
have attempted at motion fidelity evaluation using human perception or physical
constraints, there remains an inherent gap between human-perceived fidelity and
physical feasibility. Moreover, the subjective and coarse binary labeling of
human perception further undermines the development of a robust data-driven
metric. We address these issues by introducing a physical labeling method. This
method evaluates motion fidelity by calculating the minimum modifications
needed for a motion to align with physical laws. With this approach, we are
able to produce fine-grained, continuous physical alignment annotations that
serve as objective ground truth. With these annotations, we propose PP-Motion,
a novel data-driven metric to evaluate both physical and perceptual fidelity of
human motion. To effectively capture underlying physical priors, we employ
Pearson's correlation loss for the training of our metric. Additionally, by
incorporating a human-based perceptual fidelity loss, our metric can capture
fidelity that simultaneously considers both human perception and physical
alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that our metric, PP-Motion, not
only aligns with physical laws but also aligns better with human perception of
motion fidelity than previous work.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多IP场景下的人像擦除方法MILD，通过分层扩散和人体形态引导解决复杂遮挡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂多IP场景（如人-人遮挡、人-物体纠缠）中表现不佳，主要由于数据集限制和缺乏空间解耦。

Method: 提出MILD方法，采用分层扩散策略和人体形态引导（姿态、解析、空间关系），并引入空间调制注意力。

Result: MILD在复杂人像擦除任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MILD通过分层生成和空间解耦有效解决了复杂场景下的人像擦除问题。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the success of diffusion models in
image-customized tasks. Prior works have achieved notable progress on
human-oriented erasing using explicit mask guidance and semantic-aware
inpainting. However, they struggle under complex multi-IP scenarios involving
human-human occlusions, human-object entanglements, and background
interferences. These challenges are mainly due to: 1) Dataset limitations, as
existing datasets rarely cover dense occlusions, camouflaged backgrounds, and
diverse interactions; 2) Lack of spatial decoupling, where foreground instances
cannot be effectively disentangled, limiting clean background restoration. In
this work, we introduce a high-quality multi-IP human erasing dataset with
diverse pose variations and complex backgrounds. We then propose Multi-Layer
Diffusion (MILD), a novel strategy that decomposes generation into semantically
separated pathways for each instance and the background. To enhance
human-centric understanding, we introduce Human Morphology Guidance,
integrating pose, parsing, and spatial relations. We further present
Spatially-Modulated Attention to better guide attention flow. Extensive
experiments show that MILD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on challenging
human erasing benchmarks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种仅使用多视角RGB图像进行3D语义场景图估计的方法，通过语义掩码和邻域信息增强特征，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在没有3D标注的情况下，利用多视角RGB图像实现准确的3D语义场景图估计，需解决伪点云几何噪声和背景噪声问题。

Method: 设计语义掩码引导特征聚合，结合邻域节点信息增强特征，并利用统计先验优化节点和边预测。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在仅使用多视角图像输入时优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过语义和空间信息增强特征，结合统计先验，实现了更鲁棒的3D场景图估计。

Abstract: Modern 3D semantic scene graph estimation methods utilize ground truth 3D
annotations to accurately predict target objects, predicates, and
relationships. In the absence of given 3D ground truth representations, we
explore leveraging only multi-view RGB images to tackle this task. To attain
robust features for accurate scene graph estimation, we must overcome the noisy
reconstructed pseudo point-based geometry from predicted depth maps and reduce
the amount of background noise present in multi-view image features. The key is
to enrich node and edge features with accurate semantic and spatial information
and through neighboring relations. We obtain semantic masks to guide feature
aggregation to filter background features and design a novel method to
incorporate neighboring node information to aid robustness of our scene graph
estimates. Furthermore, we leverage on explicit statistical priors calculated
from the training summary statistics to refine node and edge predictions based
on their one-hop neighborhood. Our experiments show that our method outperforms
current methods purely using multi-view images as the initial input. Our
project page is available at https://qixun1.github.io/projects/SCRSSG.

### [13] [Slice or the Whole Pie? Utility Control for AI Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06551)
*Ye Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NNObfuscator是一种新型实用控制机制，允许AI模型根据预设条件动态调整性能，避免为不同用户需求训练多个模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法中为不同性能需求训练和维护多个模型的低效问题。

Method: 提出NNObfuscator机制，通过动态调整模型性能实现单一模型适应多任务需求。

Result: 实验验证表明，NNObfuscator能显著提升模型适应性，减少计算资源浪费。

Conclusion: NNObfuscator为AI模型部署提供了高效、可持续的解决方案。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) has become an increasingly
resource-intensive task, requiring large volumes of labeled data, substantial
computational power, and considerable fine-tuning efforts to achieve optimal
performance across diverse use cases. Although pre-trained models offer a
useful starting point, adapting them to meet specific user needs often demands
extensive customization, and infrastructure overhead. This challenge grows when
a single model must support diverse appli-cations with differing requirements
for performance. Traditional solutions often involve training multiple model
versions to meet varying requirements, which can be inefficient and difficult
to maintain. In order to overcome this challenge, we propose NNObfuscator, a
novel utility control mechanism that enables AI models to dynamically modify
their performance according to predefined conditions. It is different from
traditional methods that need separate models for each user. Instead,
NNObfuscator allows a single model to be adapted in real time, giving you
controlled access to multiple levels of performance. This mechanism enables
model owners set up tiered access, ensuring that free-tier users receive a
baseline level of performance while premium users benefit from enhanced
capabilities. The approach improves resource allocation, reduces unnecessary
computation, and supports sustainable business models in AI deployment. To
validate our approach, we conducted experiments on multiple tasks, including
image classification, semantic segmentation, and text to image generation,
using well-established models such as ResNet, DeepLab, VGG16, FCN and Stable
Diffusion. Experimental results show that NNObfuscator successfully makes model
more adaptable, so that a single trained model can handle a broad range of
tasks without requiring a lot of changes.

Abstract: The challenges associated with deepfake detection are increasing
significantly with the latest advancements in technology and the growing
popularity of deepfake videos and images. Despite the presence of numerous
detection models, demographic bias in the deepfake dataset remains largely
unaddressed. This paper focuses on the mitigation of age-specific bias in the
deepfake dataset by introducing an age-diverse deepfake dataset that will
improve fairness across age groups. The dataset is constructed through a
modular pipeline incorporating the existing deepfake datasets Celeb-DF,
FaceForensics++, and UTKFace datasets, and the creation of synthetic data to
fill the age distribution gaps. The effectiveness and generalizability of this
dataset are evaluated using three deepfake detection models: XceptionNet,
EfficientNet, and LipForensics. Evaluation metrics, including AUC, pAUC, and
EER, revealed that models trained on the age-diverse dataset demonstrated
fairer performance across age groups, improved overall accuracy, and higher
generalization across datasets. This study contributes a reproducible,
fairness-aware deepfake dataset and model pipeline that can serve as a
foundation for future research in fairer deepfake detection. The complete
dataset and implementation code are available at

Abstract: The advancement of intelligent agents has revolutionized problem-solving
across diverse domains, yet solutions for personalized fashion styling remain
underexplored, which holds immense promise for promoting shopping experiences.
In this work, we present StyleTailor, the first collaborative agent framework
that seamlessly unifies personalized apparel design, shopping recommendation,
virtual try-on, and systematic evaluation into a cohesive workflow. To this
end, StyleTailor pioneers an iterative visual refinement paradigm driven by
multi-level negative feedback, enabling adaptive and precise user alignment.
Specifically, our framework features two core agents, i.e., Designer for
personalized garment selection and Consultant for virtual try-on, whose outputs
are progressively refined via hierarchical vision-language model feedback
spanning individual items, complete outfits, and try-on efficacy.
Counterexamples are aggregated into negative prompts, forming a closed-loop
mechanism that enhances recommendation quality.To assess the performance, we
introduce a comprehensive evaluation suite encompassing style consistency,
visual quality, face similarity, and artistic appraisal. Extensive experiments
demonstrate StyleTailor's superior performance in delivering personalized
designs and recommendations, outperforming strong baselines without negative
feedback and establishing a new benchmark for intelligent fashion systems.

### [17] [From Label Error Detection to Correction: A Modular Framework and Benchmark for Object Detection Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06556)
*Sarina Penquitt,Jonathan Klees,Rinor Cakaj,Daniel Kondermann,Matthias Rottmann,Lars Schmarje*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种半自动化的标签错误校正框架REC$\checkmark$D，通过结合现有检测器和众包微任务，显著提高了标注质量，并在KITTI数据集中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标检测数据集中普遍存在标签错误（如缺失、分类错误或定位不准确），这些错误会影响训练和评估结果，但目前缺乏系统性的大规模校正方法。

Method: REC$\checkmark$D框架结合现有错误检测器和众包微任务，通过多标注者独立验证候选框并聚合结果，估计模糊性并提升标注质量。

Result: 在KITTI数据集的“行人”类中，校正后的标注显示原始标注中至少24%存在错误。框架能高效恢复数百个错误，但现有方法仍可能遗漏66%的真实错误。

Conclusion: REC$\checkmark$D显著提升了标注质量，并发布了一个新的真实世界基准数据集，为标签错误检测和校正的进一步研究提供了支持。

Abstract: Object detection has advanced rapidly in recent years, driven by increasingly
large and diverse datasets. However, label errors, defined as missing labels,
incorrect classification or inaccurate localization, often compromise the
quality of these datasets. This can have a significant impact on the outcomes
of training and benchmark evaluations. Although several methods now exist for
detecting label errors in object detection datasets, they are typically
validated only on synthetic benchmarks or limited manual inspection. How to
correct such errors systemically and at scale therefore remains an open
problem. We introduce a semi-automated framework for label-error correction
called REC$\checkmark$D (Rechecked). Building on existing detectors, the
framework pairs their error proposals with lightweight, crowd-sourced
microtasks. These tasks enable multiple annotators to independently verify each
candidate bounding box, and their responses are aggregated to estimate
ambiguity and improve label quality. To demonstrate the effectiveness of
REC$\checkmark$D, we apply it to the class pedestrian in the KITTI dataset. Our
crowdsourced review yields high-quality corrected annotations, which indicate a
rate of at least 24% of missing and inaccurate annotations in original
annotations. This validated set will be released as a new real-world benchmark
for label error detection and correction. We show that current label error
detection methods, when combined with our correction framework, can recover
hundreds of errors in the time it would take a human to annotate bounding boxes
from scratch. However, even the best methods still miss up to 66% of the true
errors and with low quality labels introduce more errors than they find. This
highlights the urgent need for further research, now enabled by our released
benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态特权知识蒸馏（MMPKD）方法，利用训练时额外的模态数据指导单模态视觉模型，提升注意力图的零样本能力，但效果不跨域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床实践中部署深度学习模型常需多模态数据，但推理时并非所有模态都可用，因此探索如何利用训练时的额外模态提升单模态模型性能。

Method: 提出MMPKD训练策略，使用文本和表格元数据作为教师模型（分别针对胸部X光和乳腺X光），将知识蒸馏到视觉Transformer学生模型中。

Result: MMPKD能提升注意力图的零样本定位能力，但效果不跨域。

Conclusion: MMPKD在特定领域内有效，但跨域泛化能力有限。

Abstract: Deploying deep learning models in clinical practice often requires leveraging
multiple data modalities, such as images, text, and structured data, to achieve
robust and trustworthy decisions. However, not all modalities are always
available at inference time. In this work, we propose multimodal privileged
knowledge distillation (MMPKD), a training strategy that utilizes additional
modalities available solely during training to guide a unimodal vision model.
Specifically, we used a text-based teacher model for chest radiographs
(MIMIC-CXR) and a tabular metadata-based teacher model for mammography
(CBIS-DDSM) to distill knowledge into a vision transformer student model. We
show that MMPKD can improve the resulting attention maps' zero-shot
capabilities of localizing ROI in input images, while this effect does not
generalize across domains, as contrarily suggested by prior research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态情感识别任务中，现有模型缺乏心理学意义的先验指导多模态对齐，导致性能受限。

Result: 在IEMOCAP和MELD数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: VEGA机制通过心理学对齐的多模态表示提升了情感识别效果。

Abstract: Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversations remains a challenging task
due to the complex interplay of textual, acoustic and visual signals. While
recent models have improved performance via advanced fusion strategies, they
often lack psychologically meaningful priors to guide multimodal alignment. In
this paper, we revisit the use of CLIP and propose a novel Visual Emotion
Guided Anchoring (VEGA) mechanism that introduces class-level visual semantics
into the fusion and classification process. Distinct from prior work that
primarily utilizes CLIP's textual encoder, our approach leverages its image
encoder to construct emotion-specific visual anchors based on facial exemplars.
These anchors guide unimodal and multimodal features toward a perceptually
grounded and psychologically aligned representation space, drawing inspiration
from cognitive theories (prototypical emotion categories and multisensory
integration). A stochastic anchor sampling strategy further enhances robustness
by balancing semantic stability and intra-class diversity. Integrated into a
dual-branch architecture with self-distillation, our VEGA-augmented model
achieves sota performance on IEMOCAP and MELD. Code is available at:

Abstract: Integrating brain imaging data with clinical reports offers a valuable
opportunity to leverage complementary multimodal information for more effective
and timely diagnosis in practical clinical settings. This approach has gained
significant attention in brain disorder research, yet a key challenge remains:
how to effectively link objective imaging data with subjective text-based
reports, such as doctors' notes. In this work, we propose a novel framework
that aligns brain connectomes with clinical reports in a shared cross-modal
latent space at both the subject and connectome levels, thereby enhancing
representation learning. The key innovation of our approach is that we treat
brain subnetworks as tokens of imaging data, rather than raw image patches, to
align with word tokens in clinical reports. This enables a more efficient
identification of system-level associations between neuroimaging findings and
clinical observations, which is critical since brain disorders often manifest
as network-level abnormalities rather than isolated regional alterations. We
applied our method to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using the ADNI dataset.
Our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance but also
identifies clinically meaningful connectome-text pairs, offering new insights
into the early mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease and supporting the development
of clinically useful multimodal biomarkers.

TL;DR: Surformer v1是一种基于Transformer的架构，结合触觉和视觉输入进行表面材料分类，在准确性和计算效率之间取得了良好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表面材料识别是机器人感知和物理交互的关键，尤其是在结合触觉和视觉输入时。

Method: 提出Surformer v1，使用结构化触觉特征和PCA降维的视觉嵌入，结合模态特定编码器和跨模态注意力层。

Result: Surformer v1在触觉分类中表现最佳，多模态融合后达到99.4%准确率，推理时间0.77毫秒。

Conclusion: Surformer v1在准确性、效率和计算成本之间提供了优越的平衡，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: Surface material recognition is a key component in robotic perception and
physical interaction, particularly when leveraging both tactile and visual
sensory inputs. In this work, we propose Surformer v1, a transformer-based
architecture designed for surface classification using structured tactile
features and PCA-reduced visual embeddings extracted via ResNet-50. The model
integrates modality-specific encoders with cross-modal attention layers,
enabling rich interactions between vision and touch. Currently,
state-of-the-art deep learning models for vision tasks have achieved remarkable
performance. With this in mind, our first set of experiments focused
exclusively on tactile-only surface classification. Using feature engineering,
we trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models, assessing their
accuracy and inference time. We then implemented an encoder-only Transformer
model tailored for tactile features. This model not only achieved the highest
accuracy but also demonstrated significantly faster inference time compared to
other evaluated models, highlighting its potential for real-time applications.
To extend this investigation, we introduced a multimodal fusion setup by
combining vision and tactile inputs. We trained both Surformer v1 (using
structured features) and Multimodal CNN (using raw images) to examine the
impact of feature-based versus image-based multimodal learning on
classification accuracy and computational efficiency. The results showed that
Surformer v1 achieved 99.4% accuracy with an inference time of 0.77 ms, while
the Multimodal CNN achieved slightly higher accuracy but required significantly
more inference time. These findings suggest Surformer v1 offers a compelling
balance between accuracy, efficiency, and computational cost for surface
material recognition.

Abstract: The existing research has primarily focused on text and image-based hate
speech detection, video-based approaches remain underexplored. In this work, we
introduce a novel dataset, ImpliHateVid, specifically curated for implicit hate
speech detection in videos. ImpliHateVid consists of 2,009 videos comprising
509 implicit hate videos, 500 explicit hate videos, and 1,000 non-hate videos,
making it one of the first large-scale video datasets dedicated to implicit
hate detection. We also propose a novel two-stage contrastive learning
framework for hate speech detection in videos. In the first stage, we train
modality-specific encoders for audio, text, and image using contrastive loss by
concatenating features from the three encoders. In the second stage, we train
cross-encoders using contrastive learning to refine multimodal representations.
Additionally, we incorporate sentiment, emotion, and caption-based features to
enhance implicit hate detection. We evaluate our method on two datasets,
ImpliHateVid for implicit hate speech detection and another dataset for general
hate speech detection in videos, HateMM dataset, demonstrating the
effectiveness of the proposed multimodal contrastive learning for hateful
content detection in videos and the significance of our dataset.

TL;DR: 论文提出ContextGuard-LVLM框架，利用视觉语言大模型和多阶段上下文推理机制，解决数字新闻中视觉与文本信息的细粒度一致性验证问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字新闻的普及需要验证内容真实性，传统方法难以解决细粒度跨模态上下文一致性（FCCC）问题。

Method: 基于视觉语言大模型（LVLMs），结合多阶段上下文推理机制，并通过强化或对抗学习增强模型。

Result: ContextGuard-LVLM在多个数据集上显著优于现有零样本基线模型，尤其在复杂逻辑推理和上下文理解方面表现突出。

Conclusion: ContextGuard-LVLM能有效检测复杂的上下文不一致性，并在对抗扰动和专家判断一致性上表现优异。

Abstract: The proliferation of digital news media necessitates robust methods for
verifying content veracity, particularly regarding the consistency between
visual and textual information. Traditional approaches often fall short in
addressing the fine-grained cross-modal contextual consistency (FCCC) problem,
which encompasses deeper alignment of visual narrative, emotional tone, and
background information with text, beyond mere entity matching. To address this,
we propose ContextGuard-LVLM, a novel framework built upon advanced
Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) and integrating a multi-stage contextual
reasoning mechanism. Our model is uniquely enhanced through reinforced or
adversarial learning paradigms, enabling it to detect subtle contextual
misalignments that evade zero-shot baselines. We extend and augment three
established datasets (TamperedNews-Ent, News400-Ent, MMG-Ent) with new
fine-grained contextual annotations, including "contextual sentiment," "visual
narrative theme," and "scene-event logical coherence," and introduce a
comprehensive CTXT (Contextual Coherence) entity type. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that ContextGuard-LVLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
zero-shot LVLM baselines (InstructBLIP and LLaVA 1.5) across nearly all
fine-grained consistency tasks, showing significant improvements in complex
logical reasoning and nuanced contextual understanding. Furthermore, our model
exhibits superior robustness to subtle perturbations and a higher agreement
rate with human expert judgments on challenging samples, affirming its efficacy
in discerning sophisticated forms of context detachment.

Result: 在Derm7pt数据集上，VL-MedGuide在疾病诊断（83.55% BACC, 80.12% F1）和概念检测（76.10% BACC, 67.45% F1）上表现优异，超越现有基线。

Conclusion: VL-MedGuide通过提供清晰、完整的解释，弥合了AI性能与临床实用性之间的差距，为皮肤病实践提供了可操作的见解。

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of skin diseases remains a significant challenge due to
the complex and diverse visual features present in dermatoscopic images, often
compounded by a lack of interpretability in existing purely visual diagnostic
models. To address these limitations, this study introduces VL-MedGuide
(Visual-Linguistic Medical Guide), a novel framework leveraging the powerful
multi-modal understanding and reasoning capabilities of Visual-Language Large
Models (LVLMs) for intelligent and inherently interpretable auxiliary diagnosis
of skin conditions. VL-MedGuide operates in two interconnected stages: a
Multi-modal Concept Perception Module, which identifies and linguistically
describes dermatologically relevant visual features through sophisticated
prompt engineering, and an Explainable Disease Reasoning Module, which
integrates these concepts with raw visual information via Chain-of-Thought
prompting to provide precise disease diagnoses alongside transparent
rationales. Comprehensive experiments on the Derm7pt dataset demonstrate that
VL-MedGuide achieves state-of-the-art performance in both disease diagnosis
(83.55% BACC, 80.12% F1) and concept detection (76.10% BACC, 67.45% F1),
surpassing existing baselines. Furthermore, human evaluations confirm the high
clarity, completeness, and trustworthiness of its generated explanations,
bridging the gap between AI performance and clinical utility by offering
actionable, explainable insights for dermatological practice.

Abstract: We introduce a diffusion-based cross-domain image translator in the absence
of paired training data. Unlike GAN-based methods, our approach integrates
diffusion models to learn the image translation process, allowing for more
coverable modeling of the data distribution and performance improvement of the
cross-domain translation. However, incorporating the translation process within
the diffusion process is still challenging since the two processes are not
aligned exactly, i.e., the diffusion process is applied to the noisy signal
while the translation process is conducted on the clean signal. As a result,
recent diffusion-based studies employ separate training or shallow integration
to learn the two processes, yet this may cause the local minimal of the
translation optimization, constraining the effectiveness of diffusion models.
To address the problem, we propose a novel joint learning framework that aligns
the diffusion and the translation process, thereby improving the global
optimality. Specifically, we propose to extract the image components with
diffusion models to represent the clean signal and employ the translation
process with the image components, enabling an end-to-end joint learning
manner. On the other hand, we introduce a time-dependent translation network to
learn the complex translation mapping, resulting in effective translation
learning and significant performance improvement. Benefiting from the design of
joint learning, our method enables global optimization of both processes,
enhancing the optimality and achieving improved fidelity and structural
consistency. We have conducted extensive experiments on RGB$\leftrightarrow$RGB
and diverse cross-modality translation tasks including
RGB$\leftrightarrow$Edge, RGB$\leftrightarrow$Semantics and
RGB$\leftrightarrow$Depth, showcasing better generative performances than the
state of the arts.

Conclusion: 这种分解范式为神经场景表示中的复杂外观建模提供了灵活有效的方向。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown impressive performance in novel view
synthesis, but challenges remain in rendering scenes with complex specular
reflections and highlights. Existing approaches may produce blurry reflections
due to entanglement between lighting and material properties, or encounter
optimization instability when relying on physically-based inverse rendering. In
this work, we present a neural rendering framework based on dynamic coefficient
decomposition, aiming to improve the modeling of view-dependent appearance. Our
approach decomposes complex appearance into a shared, static neural basis that
encodes intrinsic material properties, and a set of dynamic coefficients
generated by a Coefficient Network conditioned on view and illumination. A
Dynamic Radiance Integrator then combines these components to synthesize the
final radiance. Experimental results on several challenging benchmarks suggest
that our method can produce sharper and more realistic specular highlights
compared to existing techniques. We hope that this decomposition paradigm can
provide a flexible and effective direction for modeling complex appearance in
neural scene representations.

Result: CausalNet在不同噪声水平下表现稳健，并在多个标准基准上超越现有方法。

Conclusion: CausalNet为微表情识别提供了一种更实用且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is a highly challenging task in affective
computing. With the reduced-sized micro-expression (ME) input that contains key
information based on key-frame indexes, key-frame-based methods have
significantly improved the performance of MER. However, most of these methods
focus on improving the performance with relatively accurate key-frame indexes,
while ignoring the difficulty of obtaining accurate key-frame indexes and the
objective existence of key-frame index errors, which impedes them from moving
towards practical applications. In this paper, we propose CausalNet, a novel
framework to achieve robust MER facing key-frame index errors while maintaining
accurate recognition. To enhance robustness, CausalNet takes the representation
of the entire ME sequence as the input. To address the information redundancy
brought by the complete ME range input and maintain accurate recognition,
first, the Causal Motion Position Learning Module (CMPLM) is proposed to help
the model locate the muscle movement areas related to Action Units (AUs),
thereby reducing the attention to other redundant areas. Second, the Causal
Attention Block (CAB) is proposed to deeply learn the causal relationships
between the muscle contraction and relaxation movements in MEs. Empirical
experiments have demonstrated that on popular ME benchmarks, the CausalNet has
achieved robust MER under different levels of key-frame index noise. Meanwhile,
it has surpassed state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on several standard MER
benchmarks when using the provided annotated key-frames. Code is available at

Abstract: In-generation watermarking for detecting and attributing generated content
has recently been explored for latent diffusion models (LDMs), demonstrating
high robustness. However, the use of in-generation watermarks in autoregressive
(AR) image models has not been explored yet. AR models generate images by
autoregressively predicting a sequence of visual tokens that are then decoded
into pixels using a vector-quantized decoder. Inspired by red-green watermarks
for large language models, we examine token-level watermarking schemes that
bias the next-token prediction based on prior tokens. We find that a direct
transfer of these schemes works in principle, but the detectability of the
watermarks decreases considerably under common image perturbations. As a
remedy, we propose two novel watermarking methods that rely on visual token
clustering to assign similar tokens to the same set. Firstly, we investigate a
training-free approach that relies on a cluster lookup table, and secondly, we
finetune VAE encoders to predict token clusters directly from perturbed images.
Overall, our experiments show that cluster-level watermarks improve robustness
against perturbations and regeneration attacks while preserving image quality.
Cluster classification further boosts watermark detectability, outperforming a
set of baselines. Moreover, our methods offer fast verification runtime,
comparable to lightweight post-hoc watermarking methods.

underlies efficient visual understanding. In this work, we propose using line
drawings as a structure-first pretraining modality to induce more compact and
generalizable visual representations. We show that models pretrained on line
drawings develop stronger shape bias, more focused attention, and greater data
efficiency across classification, detection, and segmentation tasks. Notably,
these models also exhibit lower intrinsic dimensionality, requiring
significantly fewer principal components to capture representational variance -
echoing the similar observation in low dimensional efficient representation in
the brain. Beyond performance improvements, line drawing pretraining produces
more compressible representations, enabling better distillation into
lightweight student models. Students distilled from line-pretrained teachers
consistently outperform those trained from color-supervised teachers,
highlighting the benefits of structurally compact knowledge. Finally, we
demonstrate that the pretraining with line-drawing can also be extended to
unsupervised setting via our proposed method "learning to draw". Together, our
results support the view that structure-first visual learning fosters
efficiency, generalization, and human-aligned inductive biases - offering a
simple yet powerful strategy for building more robust and adaptable vision
systems.

Conclusion: MMFformer在多模态抑郁症检测中优于现有方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: Depression is a serious mental health illness that significantly affects an
individual's well-being and quality of life, making early detection crucial for
adequate care and treatment. Detecting depression is often difficult, as it is
based primarily on subjective evaluations during clinical interviews. Hence,
the early diagnosis of depression, thanks to the content of social networks,
has become a prominent research area. The extensive and diverse nature of
user-generated information poses a significant challenge, limiting the accurate
extraction of relevant temporal information and the effective fusion of data
across multiple modalities. This paper introduces MMFformer, a multimodal
depression detection network designed to retrieve depressive spatio-temporal
high-level patterns from multimodal social media information. The transformer
network with residual connections captures spatial features from videos, and a
transformer encoder is exploited to design important temporal dynamics in
audio. Moreover, the fusion architecture fused the extracted features through
late and intermediate fusion strategies to find out the most relevant
intermodal correlations among them. Finally, the proposed network is assessed
on two large-scale depression detection datasets, and the results clearly
reveal that it surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches, improving the
F1-Score by 13.92% for D-Vlog dataset and 7.74% for LMVD dataset. The code is

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) is a promising method that modulates
user-defined waveforms with digital holograms. An efficient and fast pipeline
framework is proposed to synthesize CGH using initial point cloud and MRI data.
This input data is reconstructed into volumetric objects that are then input
into non-convex Fourier optics optimization algorithms for phase-only hologram
(POH) and complex-hologram (CH) generation using alternating projection, SGD,
and quasi-Netwton methods. Comparison of reconstruction performance of these
algorithms as measured by MSE, RMSE, and PSNR is analyzed as well as to HoloNet
deep learning CGH. Performance metrics are shown to be improved by using 2D
median filtering to remove artifacts and speckled noise during optimization.

Abstract: Creating deformable 3D content has gained increasing attention with the rise
of text-to-image and image-to-video generative models. While these models
provide rich semantic priors for appearance, they struggle to capture the
physical realism and motion dynamics needed for authentic 4D scene synthesis.
In contrast, real-world videos can provide physically grounded geometry and
articulation cues that are difficult to hallucinate. One question is raised:
\textit{Can we generate physically consistent 4D content by leveraging the
motion priors of the real-world video}? In this work, we explore the task of
reanimating deformable 3D scenes from a single video, using the original
sequence as a supervisory signal to correct artifacts from synthetic motion. We
introduce \textbf{Restage4D}, a geometry-preserving pipeline for
video-conditioned 4D restaging. Our approach uses a video-rewinding training
strategy to temporally bridge a real base video and a synthetic driving video
via a shared motion representation. We further incorporate an occlusion-aware
rigidity loss and a disocclusion backtracing mechanism to improve structural
and geometry consistency under challenging motion. We validate Restage4D on
DAVIS and PointOdyssey, demonstrating improved geometry consistency, motion
quality, and 3D tracking performance. Our method not only preserves deformable
structure under novel motion, but also automatically corrects errors introduced
by generative models, revealing the potential of video prior in 4D restaging
task. Source code and trained models will be released.

Abstract: Accurate, noninvasive detection of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation is
essential for effective glioma management. Traditional methods rely on invasive
tissue sampling, which may fail to capture a tumor's spatial heterogeneity.
While deep learning models have shown promise in molecular profiling, their
performance is often limited by scarce annotated data. In contrast, foundation
deep learning models offer a more generalizable approach for glioma imaging
biomarkers. We propose a Foundation-based Biomarker Network (FoundBioNet) that
utilizes a SWIN-UNETR-based architecture to noninvasively predict IDH mutation
status from multi-parametric MRI. Two key modules are incorporated: Tumor-Aware
Feature Encoding (TAFE) for extracting multi-scale, tumor-focused features, and
Cross-Modality Differential (CMD) for highlighting subtle T2-FLAIR mismatch
signals associated with IDH mutation. The model was trained and validated on a
diverse, multi-center cohort of 1705 glioma patients from six public datasets.
Our model achieved AUCs of 90.58%, 88.08%, 65.41%, and 80.31% on independent
test sets from EGD, TCGA, Ivy GAP, RHUH, and UPenn, consistently outperforming
baseline approaches (p <= 0.05). Ablation studies confirmed that both the TAFE
and CMD modules are essential for improving predictive accuracy. By integrating
large-scale pretraining and task-specific fine-tuning, FoundBioNet enables
generalizable glioma characterization. This approach enhances diagnostic
accuracy and interpretability, with the potential to enable more personalized
patient care.

Abstract: Human pose and shape (HPS) estimation methods have been extensively studied,
with many demonstrating high zero-shot performance on in-the-wild images and
videos. However, these methods often struggle in challenging scenarios
involving complex human poses or significant occlusions. Although some studies
address 3D human pose estimation under occlusion, they typically evaluate
performance on datasets that lack realistic or substantial occlusions, e.g.,
most existing datasets introduce occlusions with random patches over the human
or clipart-style overlays, which may not reflect real-world challenges. To
bridge this gap in realistic occlusion datasets, we introduce a novel benchmark
dataset, VOccl3D, a Video-based human Occlusion dataset with 3D body pose and
shape annotations. Inspired by works such as AGORA and BEDLAM, we constructed
this dataset using advanced computer graphics rendering techniques,
incorporating diverse real-world occlusion scenarios, clothing textures, and
human motions. Additionally, we fine-tuned recent HPS methods, CLIFF and
BEDLAM-CLIFF, on our dataset, demonstrating significant qualitative and
quantitative improvements across multiple public datasets, as well as on the
test split of our dataset, while comparing its performance with other
state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we leveraged our dataset to enhance
human detection performance under occlusion by fine-tuning an existing object
detector, YOLO11, thus leading to a robust end-to-end HPS estimation system
under occlusions. Overall, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for
future research aimed at benchmarking methods designed to handle occlusions,
offering a more realistic alternative to existing occlusion datasets. See the

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress
across a range of vision-language tasks and demonstrate strong potential for
traffic accident understanding. However, existing MLLMs in this domain
primarily focus on coarse-grained image-level or video-level comprehension and
often struggle to handle fine-grained visual details or localized scene
components, limiting their applicability in complex accident scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose SafePLUG, a novel framework that empowers
MLLMs with both Pixel-Level Understanding and temporal Grounding for
comprehensive traffic accident analysis. SafePLUG supports both
arbitrary-shaped visual prompts for region-aware question answering and
pixel-level segmentation based on language instructions, while also enabling
the recognition of temporally anchored events in traffic accident scenarios. To
advance the development of MLLMs for traffic accident understanding, we curate
a new dataset containing multimodal question-answer pairs centered on diverse
accident scenarios, with detailed pixel-level annotations and temporal event
boundaries. Experimental results show that SafePLUG achieves strong performance
on multiple tasks, including region-based question answering, pixel-level
segmentation, temporal event localization, and accident event understanding.
These capabilities lay a foundation for fine-grained understanding of complex
traffic scenes, with the potential to improve driving safety and enhance
situational awareness in smart transportation systems. The code, dataset, and
model checkpoints will be made publicly available at:

Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound imaging provides real-time guidance during numerous
surgical procedures, but its interpretation is complicated by noise, artifacts,
and poor alignment with high-resolution preoperative MRI/CT scans. To bridge
the gap between reoperative planning and intraoperative guidance, we present
DiffUS, a physics-based, differentiable ultrasound renderer that synthesizes
realistic B-mode images from volumetric imaging. DiffUS first converts MRI 3D
scans into acoustic impedance volumes using a machine learning approach. Next,
we simulate ultrasound beam propagation using ray tracing with coupled
reflection-transmission equations. DiffUS formulates wave propagation as a
sparse linear system that captures multiple internal reflections. Finally, we
reconstruct B-mode images via depth-resolved echo extraction across fan-shaped
acquisition geometry, incorporating realistic artifacts including speckle noise
and depth-dependent degradation. DiffUS is entirely implemented as
differentiable tensor operations in PyTorch, enabling gradient-based
optimization for downstream applications such as slice-to-volume registration
and volumetric reconstruction. Evaluation on the ReMIND dataset demonstrates
DiffUS's ability to generate anatomically accurate ultrasound images from brain
MRI data.

Conclusion: 该方法生成的精确边缘显著提升了医学图像任务的临床价值。

Abstract: Accurate localization of organ boundaries is critical in medical imaging for
segmentation, registration, surgical planning, and radiotherapy. While deep
convolutional networks (ConvNets) have advanced general-purpose edge detection
to near-human performance on natural images, their outputs often lack precise
localization, a limitation that is particularly harmful in medical applications
where millimeter-level accuracy is required. Building on a systematic analysis
of ConvNet edge outputs, we propose a medically focused crisp edge detector
that adapts a novel top-down backward refinement architecture to medical images
(2D and volumetric). Our method progressively upsamples and fuses high-level
semantic features with fine-grained low-level cues through a backward
refinement pathway, producing high-resolution, well-localized organ boundaries.
We further extend the design to handle anisotropic volumes by combining 2D
slice-wise refinement with light 3D context aggregation to retain computational
efficiency. Evaluations on several CT and MRI organ datasets demonstrate
substantially improved boundary localization under strict criteria (boundary
F-measure, Hausdorff distance) compared to baseline ConvNet detectors and
contemporary medical edge/contour methods. Importantly, integrating our crisp
edge maps into downstream pipelines yields consistent gains in organ
segmentation (higher Dice scores, lower boundary errors), more accurate image
registration, and improved delineation of lesions near organ interfaces. The
proposed approach produces clinically valuable, crisp organ edges that
materially enhance common medical-imaging tasks.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of melanocytic tumors in dermoscopic images is a
critical step for automated skin cancer screening and clinical decision
support. Unlike natural scene segmentation, lesion delineation must reconcile
subtle texture and color variations, frequent artifacts (hairs, rulers,
bubbles), and a strong need for precise boundary localization to support
downstream diagnosis. In this paper we introduce Our method, a novel ResNet
inspired dual resolution architecture specifically designed for melanocytic
tumor segmentation. Our method maintains a full resolution stream that
preserves fine grained boundary information while a complementary pooled stream
aggregates multi scale contextual cues for robust lesion recognition. The
streams are tightly coupled by boundary aware residual connections that inject
high frequency edge information into deep feature maps, and by a channel
attention module that adapts color and texture sensitivity to dermoscopic
appearance. To further address common imaging artifacts and the limited size of
clinical datasets, we propose a lightweight artifact suppression block and a
multi task training objective that combines a Dice Tversky segmentation loss
with an explicit boundary loss and a contrastive regularizer for feature
stability. The combined design yields pixel accurate masks without requiring
heavy post processing or complex pre training protocols. Extensive experiments
on public dermoscopic benchmarks demonstrate that Our method significantly
improves boundary adherence and clinically relevant segmentation metrics
compared to standard encoder decoder baselines, making it a practical building
block for automated melanoma assessment systems.

Conclusion: 显著降低标注负担，同时保留临床相关的血管拓扑结构。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of subcutaneous vessels from clinical images is
hampered by scarce, expensive ground truth and by low contrast, noisy
appearance of vessels across patients and modalities. We present a novel weakly
supervised training framework tailored for subcutaneous vessel segmentation
that leverages inexpensive sparse annotations (e.g., centerline traces, dot
markers, or short scribbles). Sparse labels are expanded into dense,
probabilistic supervision via a differentiable random walk label propagation
model whose transition weights incorporate image driven vesselness cues and
tubular continuity priors. The propagation yields per-pixel hitting
probabilities together with calibrated uncertainty estimates; these are
incorporated into an uncertainty weighted loss to avoid over fitting to
ambiguous regions. Crucially, the label-propagator is learned jointly with a
CNN based segmentation predictor, enabling the system to discover vessel edges
and continuity constraints without explicit edge supervision. We further
introduce a topology aware regularizer that encourages centerline connectivity
and penalizes spurious branches, improving clinical usability. In experiments
on clinical subcutaneous imaging datasets, our method consistently outperforms
naive training on sparse labels and conventional dense pseudo-labeling,
producing more complete vascular maps and better calibrated uncertainty for
downstream decision making. The approach substantially reduces annotation
burden while preserving clinically relevant vessel topology.

Conclusion: SAGE-reID是一种高效、源无关的MSDA方法，显著提升了行人重识别的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Adapting person re-identification (reID) models to new target environments
remains a challenging problem that is typically addressed using unsupervised
domain adaptation (UDA) methods. Recent works show that when labeled data
originates from several distinct sources (e.g., datasets and cameras),
considering each source separately and applying multi-source domain adaptation
(MSDA) typically yields higher accuracy and robustness compared to blending the
sources and performing conventional UDA. However, state-of-the-art MSDA methods
learn domain-specific backbone models or require access to source domain data
during adaptation, resulting in significant growth in training parameters and
computational cost. In this paper, a Source-free Adaptive Gated Experts
(SAGE-reID) method is introduced for person reID. Our SAGE-reID is a
cost-effective, source-free MSDA method that first trains individual
source-specific low-rank adapters (LoRA) through source-free UDA. Next, a
lightweight gating network is introduced and trained to dynamically assign
optimal merging weights for fusion of LoRA experts, enabling effective
cross-domain knowledge transfer. While the number of backbone parameters
remains constant across source domains, LoRA experts scale linearly but remain
negligible in size (<= 2% of the backbone), reducing both the memory
consumption and risk of overfitting. Extensive experiments conducted on three
challenging benchmarks: Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, and MSMT17 indicate that
SAGE-reID outperforms state-of-the-art methods while being computationally
efficient.

Despite progress in modern manufacturing, maintaining dimensional precision
remains difficult, particularly for complex geometries. We present a
methodology that employs a high-resolution 3D scanner to acquire multi-angle
surface data from 237 components produced across different batches. The data
were processed through precise alignment, noise reduction, and merging
techniques to generate accurate 3D representations. A hybrid machine learning
framework was developed, combining convolutional neural networks for feature
extraction with gradient-boosted decision trees for predictive modeling. The
proposed system achieved a prediction accuracy of 0.012 mm at a 95% confidence
level, representing a 73% improvement over conventional statistical process
control methods. In addition to improved accuracy, the model revealed hidden
correlations between manufacturing parameters and geometric deviations. This
approach offers significant potential for automated quality control, predictive
maintenance, and design optimization in precision manufacturing, and the
resulting dataset provides a strong foundation for future predictive modeling

MC, where a featured difference is the extraction of view-specific local
information by introducing cardinality (i.e., $\ell_0$-norm) constraints
instead of Graph-Laplacian regularization. Specifically, under each view,
cardinality constraints directly restrict the samples used in the
self-representation stage to extract reliable local and global structure
information, while the low-rank constraint aids in revealing a global coherent
structure in the consensus affinity matrix during merging. The attendant
challenge is that Augmented Lagrange Method (ALM)-based alternating
minimization algorithms cannot guarantee convergence when applied directly to
our nonconvex, nonsmooth model, thus resulting in poor generalization ability.
To address it, we develop an alternating quadratic penalty (AQP) method with
global convergence, where two subproblems are iteratively solved by closed-form
solutions. Empirical results on six standard datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our model and AQP method, compared to eight state-of-the-art
algorithms.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为VSI的多模态关键帧搜索方法，通过结合字幕、时间戳和场景边界，显著提升了长视频理解任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频理解因数据规模庞大而具有挑战性，现有方法因多模态对齐不足和无法捕捉复杂时序语义信息而效果受限。

Method: VSI通过双流搜索机制（视频搜索流和字幕匹配流）整合视觉和文本信息，提升关键帧搜索精度。

Result: 在LongVideoBench上，VSI的关键帧定位准确率达40.00%，视频问答任务准确率达68.48%，均显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: VSI在长视频问答任务中达到SOTA性能，证明了其多模态搜索策略的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Long video understanding presents a significant challenge to multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) primarily due to the immense data scale. A critical and
widely adopted strategy for making this task computationally tractable is
keyframe retrieval, which seeks to identify a sparse set of video frames that
are most salient to a given textual query. However, the efficacy of this
approach is hindered by weak multimodal alignment between textual queries and
visual content and fails to capture the complex temporal semantic information
required for precise reasoning. To address this, we propose Visual-Subtitle
Integeration(VSI), a multimodal keyframe search method that integrates
subtitles, timestamps, and scene boundaries into a unified multimodal search
process. The proposed method captures the visual information of video frames as
well as the complementary textual information through a dual-stream search
mechanism by Video Search Stream as well as Subtitle Match Stream,
respectively, and improves the keyframe search accuracy through the interaction
of the two search streams. Experimental results show that VSI achieve 40.00%
key frame localization accuracy on the text-relevant subset of LongVideoBench
and 68.48% accuracy on downstream long Video-QA tasks, surpassing competitive
baselines by 20.35% and 15.79%, respectively. Furthermore, on the
LongVideoBench, VSI achieved state-of-the-art(SOTA) in medium-to-long video-QA
tasks, demonstrating the robustness and generalizability of the proposed
multimodal search strategy.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型噪声抑制特征金字塔网络（NS-FPN），通过低频引导特征净化（LFP）和螺旋感知特征采样（SFS）模块，显著降低了红外小目标检测中的误报率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外小目标检测面临目标暗淡、形状模糊及背景干扰大的挑战，现有CNN方法虽能增强特征表示但导致误报率增加。本文从频域分析出发，提出从噪声抑制角度提升性能。

Method: NS-FPN整合了LFP模块（通过净化高频成分抑制噪声）和SFS模块（螺旋采样融合目标相关特征），结构轻量且易于集成到现有框架。

Result: 在公开数据集上，NS-FPN显著减少误报并优于其他方法。

Conclusion: NS-FPN通过噪声抑制和特征融合，有效提升了红外小目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection and segmentation (IRSTDS) is a critical yet
challenging task in defense and civilian applications, owing to the dim,
shapeless appearance of targets and severe background clutter. Recent CNN-based
methods have achieved promising target perception results, but they only focus
on enhancing feature representation to offset the impact of noise, which
results in the increased false alarms problem. In this paper, through analyzing
the problem from the frequency domain, we pioneer in improving performance from
noise suppression perspective and propose a novel noise-suppression feature
pyramid network (NS-FPN), which integrates a low-frequency guided feature
purification (LFP) module and a spiral-aware feature sampling (SFS) module into
the original FPN structure. The LFP module suppresses the noise features by
purifying high-frequency components to achieve feature enhancement devoid of
noise interference, while the SFS module further adopts spiral sampling to fuse
target-relevant features in feature fusion process. Our NS-FPN is designed to
be lightweight yet effective and can be easily plugged into existing IRSTDS
frameworks. Extensive experiments on the public IRSTDS datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly reduces false alarms and achieves superior
performance on IRSTDS tasks.

*Jianting Tang,Yubo Wang,Haoyu Cao,Linli Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出BASIC方法，通过直接监督视觉嵌入提升多模态大语言模型的视觉理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法仅将视觉嵌入作为上下文线索，缺乏直接视觉监督，限制了视觉嵌入的精细对齐。

Method: BASIC利用LLM浅层中精炼的视觉嵌入作为监督，从嵌入方向和语义匹配两方面优化初始视觉嵌入。

Result: BASIC显著提升了MLLMs在多个基准测试中的性能。

Conclusion: 直接视觉监督有效提升了视觉嵌入的对齐质量，无需额外监督模型或人工标注。

Abstract: Mainstream Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve visual
understanding by using a vision projector to bridge well-pretrained vision
encoders and large language models (LLMs). The inherent gap between visual and
textual modalities makes the embeddings from the vision projector critical for
visual comprehension. However, current alignment approaches treat visual
embeddings as contextual cues and merely apply auto-regressive supervision to
textual outputs, neglecting the necessity of introducing equivalent direct
visual supervision, which hinders the potential finer alignment of visual
embeddings. In this paper, based on our analysis of the refinement process of
visual embeddings in the LLM's shallow layers, we propose BASIC, a method that
utilizes refined visual embeddings within the LLM as supervision to directly
guide the projector in generating initial visual embeddings. Specifically, the
guidance is conducted from two perspectives: (i) optimizing embedding
directions by reducing angles between initial and supervisory embeddings in
semantic space; (ii) improving semantic matching by minimizing disparities
between the logit distributions of both visual embeddings. Without additional
supervisory models or artificial annotations, BASIC significantly improves the
performance of MLLMs across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our introduced direct visual supervision.

Abstract: Chinese font generation aims to create a new Chinese font library based on
some reference samples. It is a topic of great concern to many font designers
and typographers. Over the past years, with the rapid development of deep
learning algorithms, various new techniques have achieved flourishing and
thriving progress. Nevertheless, how to improve the overall quality of
generated Chinese character images remains a tough issue. In this paper, we
conduct a holistic survey of the recent Chinese font generation approaches
based on deep learning. To be specific, we first illustrate the research
background of the task. Then, we outline our literature selection and analysis
methodology, and review a series of related fundamentals, including classical
deep learning architectures, font representation formats, public datasets, and
frequently-used evaluation metrics. After that, relying on the number of
reference samples required to generate a new font, we categorize the existing
methods into two major groups: many-shot font generation and few-shot font
generation methods. Within each category, representative approaches are
summarized, and their strengths and limitations are also discussed in detail.
Finally, we conclude our paper with the challenges and future directions, with
the expectation to provide some valuable illuminations for the researchers in
this field.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为eMotions的大规模短视频情感数据集，并设计了AV-CANet网络来解决短视频情感分析中的多模态融合挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 短视频（SVs）的多模态复杂性为情感分析带来新挑战，现有数据不足且存在主观偏差。

Method: 提出多阶段标注流程确保数据质量，设计AV-CANet网络结合视频Transformer和局部-全局融合模块，引入EP-CE损失函数优化。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了AV-CANet的有效性，并通过消融实验分析了关键组件。

Conclusion: AV-CANet为短视频情感分析提供了有效解决方案，数据集和代码将开源。

Abstract: Short-form videos (SVs) have become a vital part of our online routine for
acquiring and sharing information. Their multimodal complexity poses new
challenges for video analysis, highlighting the need for video emotion analysis
(VEA) within the community. Given the limited availability of SVs emotion data,
we introduce eMotions, a large-scale dataset consisting of 27,996 videos with
full-scale annotations. To ensure quality and reduce subjective bias, we
emphasize better personnel allocation and propose a multi-stage annotation
procedure. Additionally, we provide the category-balanced and test-oriented
variants through targeted sampling to meet diverse needs. While there have been
significant studies on videos with clear emotional cues (e.g., facial
expressions), analyzing emotions in SVs remains a challenging task. The
challenge arises from the broader content diversity, which introduces more
distinct semantic gaps and complicates the representations learning of
emotion-related features. Furthermore, the prevalence of audio-visual
co-expressions in SVs leads to the local biases and collective information gaps
caused by the inconsistencies in emotional expressions. To tackle this, we
propose AV-CANet, an end-to-end audio-visual fusion network that leverages
video transformer to capture semantically relevant representations. We further
introduce the Local-Global Fusion Module designed to progressively capture the
correlations of audio-visual features. Besides, EP-CE Loss is constructed to
globally steer optimizations with tripolar penalties. Extensive experiments
across three eMotions-related datasets and four public VEA datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed AV-CANet, while providing broad insights for
future research. Moreover, we conduct ablation studies to examine the critical
components of our method. Dataset and code will be made available at Github.

### [49] [A Simple yet Powerful Instance-Aware Prompting Framework for Training-free Camouflaged Object Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06904)
*Chao Yin,Jide Li,Xiaoqiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种无需训练的实例感知提示框架（IAPF），通过多模态大语言模型生成图像特定标签，并结合实例级边界框提示，显著提升了伪装物体分割的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伪装物体分割（COS）因目标物体与背景视觉相似性高而极具挑战性，现有基于训练的方法在标注稀疏时性能下降，而训练免费方法生成的语义级提示无法处理多实例场景。

Method: IAPF框架包括三个步骤：1）文本提示生成器生成图像特定标签；2）实例掩码生成器结合边界框提示和点提示生成候选实例掩码；3）自一致性投票选择最终预测。

Result: 在标准COS基准测试中，IAPF显著优于现有训练免费方法。

Conclusion: IAPF通过实例级提示和多模态语言模型，实现了无需训练的高效伪装物体分割，解决了多实例场景的挑战。

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS) remains highly challenging due to the
intrinsic visual similarity between target objects and their surroundings.
While training-based COS methods achieve good performance, their performance
degrades rapidly with increased annotation sparsity. To circumvent this
limitation, recent studies have explored training-free COS methods, leveraging
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) by automatically generating visual prompts
from a single task-generic prompt (\textit{e.g.}, "\textit{camouflaged
animal}") uniformly applied across all test images. However, these methods
typically produce only semantic-level visual prompts, causing SAM to output
coarse semantic masks and thus failing to handle scenarios with multiple
discrete camouflaged instances effectively. To address this critical
limitation, we propose a simple yet powerful \textbf{I}nstance-\textbf{A}ware
\textbf{P}rompting \textbf{F}ramework (IAPF), the first training-free COS
pipeline that explicitly converts a task-generic prompt into fine-grained
instance masks. Specifically, the IAPF comprises three steps: (1) Text Prompt
Generator, utilizing task-generic queries to prompt a Multimodal Large Language
Model (MLLM) for generating image-specific foreground and background tags; (2)
\textbf{Instance Mask Generator}, leveraging Grounding DINO to produce precise
instance-level bounding box prompts, alongside the proposed Single-Foreground
Multi-Background Prompting strategy to sample region-constrained point prompts
within each box, enabling SAM to yield a candidate instance mask; (3)
Self-consistency Instance Mask Voting, which selects the final COS prediction
by identifying the candidate mask most consistent across multiple candidate
instance masks. Extensive evaluations on standard COS benchmarks demonstrate
that the proposed IAPF significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art
training-free COS methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个多参考图像生成任务，并开发了MultiRef-bench评估框架和RefBlend数据引擎，用于生成和评估多参考图像生成模型的表现。实验表明，现有模型在多参考条件下表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像生成框架主要依赖单一输入（文本或单张参考图像），而设计师通常需要从多张参考图像中获取灵感。因此，论文旨在解决多参考图像生成的问题。

Method: 提出MultiRef-bench评估框架和RefBlend数据引擎，生成合成和真实样本。实验评估了三种图像-文本模型和六种代理框架在多参考条件下的表现。

Result: 现有模型在多参考条件下表现不佳，最佳模型OmniGen在合成样本和真实样本中的平均得分分别为66.6%和79.0%。

Conclusion: 研究为开发更灵活、更接近人类创作能力的多参考图像生成工具提供了方向，并公开了数据集MultiRef。

Abstract: Visual designers naturally draw inspiration from multiple visual references,
combining diverse elements and aesthetic principles to create artwork. However,
current image generative frameworks predominantly rely on single-source inputs
-- either text prompts or individual reference images. In this paper, we focus
on the task of controllable image generation using multiple visual references.
We introduce MultiRef-bench, a rigorous evaluation framework comprising 990
synthetic and 1,000 real-world samples that require incorporating visual
content from multiple reference images. The synthetic samples are synthetically
generated through our data engine RefBlend, with 10 reference types and 33
reference combinations. Based on RefBlend, we further construct a dataset
MultiRef containing 38k high-quality images to facilitate further research. Our
experiments across three interleaved image-text models (i.e., OmniGen, ACE, and
Show-o) and six agentic frameworks (e.g., ChatDiT and LLM + SD) reveal that
even state-of-the-art systems struggle with multi-reference conditioning, with
the best model OmniGen achieving only 66.6% in synthetic samples and 79.0% in
real-world cases on average compared to the golden answer. These findings
provide valuable directions for developing more flexible and human-like
creative tools that can effectively integrate multiple sources of visual
inspiration. The dataset is publicly available at: https://multiref.github.io/.

Motivation: 传统行人重识别模型在多模态数据（如RGB、热成像、红外、素描图像和文本描述）中泛化能力差，而现有方法未充分利用MLLMs的推理和跨模态理解能力。

Method: 引入MMReID-Bench基准，包含20,710个多模态查询和库图像，覆盖10种行人重识别任务，全面评估MLLMs的能力。

Result: 实验表明MLLMs在行人重识别中表现优异，但在处理热成像和红外数据时仍有局限。

Conclusion: MMReID-Bench有望推动开发更鲁棒和通用的多模态基础模型，提升行人重识别性能。

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) aims to retrieve the images of an interested
person in the gallery images, with wide applications in medical rehabilitation,
abnormal behavior detection, and public security. However, traditional person
ReID models suffer from uni-modal capability, leading to poor generalization
ability in multi-modal data, such as RGB, thermal, infrared, sketch images,
textual descriptions, etc. Recently, the emergence of multi-modal large
language models (MLLMs) shows a promising avenue for addressing this problem.
Despite this potential, existing methods merely regard MLLMs as feature
extractors or caption generators, which do not fully unleash their reasoning,
instruction-following, and cross-modal understanding capabilities. To bridge
this gap, we introduce MMReID-Bench, the first multi-task multi-modal benchmark
specifically designed for person ReID. The MMReID-Bench includes 20,710
multi-modal queries and gallery images covering 10 different person ReID tasks.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable capabilities of MLLMs in
delivering effective and versatile person ReID. Nevertheless, they also have
limitations in handling a few modalities, particularly thermal and infrared
data. We hope MMReID-Bench can facilitate the community to develop more robust
and generalizable multimodal foundation models for person ReID.

Conclusion: Talk2Image通过多代理协作和反馈机制，显著提升了多轮图像生成和编辑的效果。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation tasks have driven remarkable advances in diverse
media applications, yet most focus on single-turn scenarios and struggle with
iterative, multi-turn creative tasks. Recent dialogue-based systems attempt to
bridge this gap, but their single-agent, sequential paradigm often causes
intention drift and incoherent edits. To address these limitations, we present
Talk2Image, a novel multi-agent system for interactive image generation and
editing in multi-turn dialogue scenarios. Our approach integrates three key
components: intention parsing from dialogue history, task decomposition and
collaborative execution across specialized agents, and feedback-driven
refinement based on a multi-view evaluation mechanism. Talk2Image enables
step-by-step alignment with user intention and consistent image editing.
Experiments demonstrate that Talk2Image outperforms existing baselines in
controllability, coherence, and user satisfaction across iterative image
generation and editing tasks.

Abstract: Inspired by the success of reinforcement learning (RL) in refining large

training into autoregressive (AR) image generation models. We adapt the Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to refine the vanilla
autoregressive models' outputs by carefully designed reward functions that
evaluate generated images across multiple quality dimensions, including
perceptual quality, realism, and semantic fidelity. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on both class-conditional (i.e., class-to-image) and
text-conditional (i.e., text-to-image) image generation tasks, demonstrating
that our RL-enhanced framework significantly improves both the image quality
and human preference of generated images compared to the standard AR baselines.
Our results show consistent improvements across various evaluation metrics,
establishing the viability of RL-based optimization for AR image generation and
opening new avenues for controllable and high-quality image synthesis. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在编辑区域的文本依从性、未编辑区域的上下文保真度以及编辑的无缝整合方面存在不足。

Method: 采用选择性Canny控制保留未编辑区域的细节，结合双提示指导（局部和全局提示）实现精确编辑。

Result: 在真实图像编辑任务中，CannyEdit在文本依从性和上下文保真度的平衡上优于现有方法，用户研究显示其编辑结果更自然。

Conclusion: CannyEdit通过创新方法显著提升了图像编辑的质量和自然度。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models have enabled training-free
regional image editing by leveraging the generative priors of foundation
models. However, existing methods struggle to balance text adherence in edited
regions, context fidelity in unedited areas, and seamless integration of edits.
We introduce CannyEdit, a novel training-free framework that addresses these
challenges through two key innovations: (1) Selective Canny Control, which
masks the structural guidance of Canny ControlNet in user-specified editable
regions while strictly preserving details of the source images in unedited
areas via inversion-phase ControlNet information retention. This enables
precise, text-driven edits without compromising contextual integrity. (2)
Dual-Prompt Guidance, which combines local prompts for object-specific edits
with a global target prompt to maintain coherent scene interactions. On
real-world image editing tasks (addition, replacement, removal), CannyEdit
outperforms prior methods like KV-Edit, achieving a 2.93 to 10.49 percent
improvement in the balance of text adherence and context fidelity. In terms of
editing seamlessness, user studies reveal only 49.2 percent of general users
and 42.0 percent of AIGC experts identified CannyEdit's results as AI-edited
when paired with real images without edits, versus 76.08 to 89.09 percent for
competitor methods.

Abstract: Sign Language Production (SLP) is the task of generating sign language video
from spoken language inputs. The field has seen a range of innovations over the
last few years, with the introduction of deep learning-based approaches
providing significant improvements in the realism and naturalness of generated
outputs. However, the lack of standardized evaluation metrics for SLP
approaches hampers meaningful comparisons across different systems. To address
this, we introduce the first Sign Language Production Challenge, held as part
of the third SLRTP Workshop at CVPR 2025. The competition's aims are to
evaluate architectures that translate from spoken language sentences to a
sequence of skeleton poses, known as Text-to-Pose (T2P) translation, over a
range of metrics. For our evaluation data, we use the
RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T dataset, a German Sign Language - Deutsche
Gebardensprache (DGS) weather broadcast dataset. In addition, we curate a
custom hidden test set from a similar domain of discourse. This paper presents
the challenge design and the winning methodologies. The challenge attracted 33
participants who submitted 231 solutions, with the top-performing team
achieving BLEU-1 scores of 31.40 and DTW-MJE of 0.0574. The winning approach
utilized a retrieval-based framework and a pre-trained language model. As part
of the workshop, we release a standardized evaluation network, including
high-quality skeleton extraction-based keypoints establishing a consistent
baseline for the SLP field, which will enable future researchers to compare
their work against a broader range of methods.

Motivation: 现有频率域方法基于固定基函数，无法适应图像内容和动态调整特征提取。

Method: SCOPE包含两个模块：SDE动态增强浅层细节，SSR从高层特征学习语义一致性。两者级联结合局部细节与全局语义。

Result: 在四个细粒度图像分类基准上达到了新的最优性能。

Conclusion: SCOPE突破了频率域固定尺度的限制，提高了多尺度融合的灵活性。

Abstract: The crux of resolving fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) lies in
capturing discriminative and class-specific cues that correspond to subtle
visual characteristics. Recently, frequency decomposition/transform based
approaches have attracted considerable interests since its appearing
discriminative cue mining ability. However, the frequency-domain methods are
based on fixed basis functions, lacking adaptability to image content and
unable to dynamically adjust feature extraction according to the discriminative
requirements of different images. To address this, we propose a novel method
for FGVC, named Subtle-Cue Oriented Perception Engine (SCOPE), which adaptively
enhances the representational capability of low-level details and high-level
semantics in the spatial domain, breaking through the limitations of fixed
scales in the frequency domain and improving the flexibility of multi-scale
fusion. The core of SCOPE lies in two modules: the Subtle Detail Extractor
(SDE), which dynamically enhances subtle details such as edges and textures
from shallow features, and the Salient Semantic Refiner (SSR), which learns
semantically coherent and structure-aware refinement features from the
high-level features guided by the enhanced shallow features. The SDE and SSR
are cascaded stage-by-stage to progressively combine local details with global
semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves new
state-of-the-art on four popular fine-grained image classification benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2VR攻击主要关注降低视频排名，而提升视频排名的攻击未被充分研究，这种攻击可能带来更大的经济利益和（错误）信息传播风险。

Method: 提出Video Promotion攻击（ViPro）和Modal Refinement（MoRe）方法，通过精细捕捉视觉与文本模态的交互增强攻击效果。

Result: ViPro在白盒、灰盒和黑盒设置下平均优于基线方法30%、10%和4%，并在多目标场景中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了T2VR的潜在漏洞，提供了攻击的上下界分析，并为防御措施提供了参考。代码将公开。

Abstract: Thanks to the development of cross-modal models, text-to-video retrieval
(T2VR) is advancing rapidly, but its robustness remains largely unexamined.
Existing attacks against T2VR are designed to push videos away from queries,
i.e., suppressing the ranks of videos, while the attacks that pull videos
towards selected queries, i.e., promoting the ranks of videos, remain largely
unexplored. These attacks can be more impactful as attackers may gain more
views/clicks for financial benefits and widespread (mis)information. To this
end, we pioneer the first attack against T2VR to promote videos adversarially,
dubbed the Video Promotion attack (ViPro). We further propose Modal Refinement
(MoRe) to capture the finer-grained, intricate interaction between visual and
textual modalities to enhance black-box transferability. Comprehensive
experiments cover 2 existing baselines, 3 leading T2VR models, 3 prevailing
datasets with over 10k videos, evaluated under 3 scenarios. All experiments are
conducted in a multi-target setting to reflect realistic scenarios where
attackers seek to promote the video regarding multiple queries simultaneously.
We also evaluated our attacks for defences and imperceptibility. Overall, ViPro
surpasses other baselines by over $30/10/4\%$ for white/grey/black-box settings
on average. Our work highlights an overlooked vulnerability, provides a
qualitative analysis on the upper/lower bound of our attacks, and offers
insights into potential counterplays. Code will be publicly available at

*Ulas Gunes,Matias Turkulainen,Juho Kannala,Esa Rahtu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文首次评估了基于鱼眼镜头的3D高斯溅射方法Fisheye-GS和3DGUT在真实图像上的表现，覆盖了超过180度视场的室内外场景，并分析了极端畸变的处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索鱼眼镜头在3D重建中的实际应用潜力，尤其是在极端畸变和稀疏输入条件下的表现。

Method: 通过不同视场（200度、160度、120度）评估性能，并提出基于UniK3D预测的深度初始化策略，以解决SfM在强畸变下的失效问题。

Result: Fisheye-GS在160度视场下表现最佳，而3DGUT在所有视场下均保持稳定且高质量的感知效果。UniK3D虽未针对鱼眼数据训练，但仍能生成密集点云，效果与SfM相当。

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于鱼眼镜头的3D高斯溅射方法在宽角度3D重建中具有实际可行性，尤其适用于稀疏且畸变严重的输入图像。

Abstract: We present the first evaluation of fisheye-based 3D Gaussian Splatting
methods, Fisheye-GS and 3DGUT, on real images with fields of view exceeding 180
degree. Our study covers both indoor and outdoor scenes captured with 200
degree fisheye cameras and analyzes how each method handles extreme distortion
in real world settings. We evaluate performance under varying fields of view
(200 degree, 160 degree, and 120 degree) to study the tradeoff between
peripheral distortion and spatial coverage. Fisheye-GS benefits from field of
view (FoV) reduction, particularly at 160 degree, while 3DGUT remains stable
across all settings and maintains high perceptual quality at the full 200
degree view. To address the limitations of SfM-based initialization, which
often fails under strong distortion, we also propose a depth-based strategy
using UniK3D predictions from only 2-3 fisheye images per scene. Although
UniK3D is not trained on real fisheye data, it produces dense point clouds that
enable reconstruction quality on par with SfM, even in difficult scenes with
fog, glare, or sky. Our results highlight the practical viability of
fisheye-based 3DGS methods for wide-angle 3D reconstruction from sparse and
distortion-heavy image inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂天气和光照条件对自动驾驶场景的理解和重建提出了挑战，现有扩散模型难以控制且缺乏鲁棒性。

Method: 提出WeatherDiffusion框架，结合文本引导的预测本征图和MAA机制，实现高质量逆向渲染，并构建合成和真实数据集。

Result: 在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，并在下游任务中提升了目标检测和图像分割的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: WeatherDiffusion为自动驾驶场景的渲染和编辑提供了高效且可控的解决方案。

Abstract: Forward and inverse rendering have emerged as key techniques for enabling
understanding and reconstruction in the context of autonomous driving (AD).
However, complex weather and illumination pose great challenges to this task.
The emergence of large diffusion models has shown promise in achieving
reasonable results through learning from 2D priors, but these models are
difficult to control and lack robustness. In this paper, we introduce
WeatherDiffusion, a diffusion-based framework for forward and inverse rendering
on AD scenes with various weather and lighting conditions. Our method enables
authentic estimation of material properties, scene geometry, and lighting, and
further supports controllable weather and illumination editing through the use
of predicted intrinsic maps guided by text descriptions. We observe that
different intrinsic maps should correspond to different regions of the original
image. Based on this observation, we propose Intrinsic map-aware attention
(MAA) to enable high-quality inverse rendering. Additionally, we introduce a
synthetic dataset (\ie WeatherSynthetic) and a real-world dataset (\ie
WeatherReal) for forward and inverse rendering on AD scenes with diverse
weather and lighting. Extensive experiments show that our WeatherDiffusion
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks. Moreover, our
method demonstrates significant value in downstream tasks for AD, enhancing the
robustness of object detection and image segmentation in challenging weather
scenarios.

Motivation: 现有文档去扭曲方法在复杂结构和高度变形场景下效果不佳，作者认为去扭曲应是一个渐进过程而非一步变换。

Result: 实验表明TADoc在多种文档类型和变形程度下具有强鲁棒性，性能优于基准方法。

Conclusion: 动态渐进式去扭曲方法TADoc及新评价指标DLS有效提升了文档图像去扭曲的效果和评价全面性。

Abstract: Flattening curved, wrinkled, and rotated document images captured by portable
photographing devices, termed document image dewarping, has become an
increasingly important task with the rise of digital economy and online
working. Although many methods have been proposed recently, they often struggle
to achieve satisfactory results when confronted with intricate document
structures and higher degrees of deformation in real-world scenarios. Our main
insight is that, unlike other document restoration tasks (e.g., deblurring),
dewarping in real physical scenes is a progressive motion rather than a
one-step transformation. Based on this, we have undertaken two key initiatives.
Firstly, we reformulate this task, modeling it for the first time as a dynamic
process that encompasses a series of intermediate states. Secondly, we design a
lightweight framework called TADoc (Time-Aware Document Dewarping Network) to
address the geometric distortion of document images. In addition, due to the
inadequacy of OCR metrics for document images containing sparse text, the
comprehensiveness of evaluation is insufficient. To address this shortcoming,
we propose a new metric -- DLS (Document Layout Similarity) -- to evaluate the
effectiveness of document dewarping in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments
and in-depth evaluations have been conducted and the results indicate that our
model possesses strong robustness, achieving superiority on several benchmarks
with different document types and degrees of distortion.

TL;DR: OctreeNCA通过八叉树数据结构扩展神经细胞自动机的邻域定义，高效处理全局信息，显著降低VRAM消耗并提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割中，大尺寸输入（如病理切片或手术视频）需要全局上下文，但现有模型（如UNet或Vision Transformers）因VRAM限制无法一次性处理。

Method: 提出OctreeNCA，利用八叉树结构扩展NCA的邻域定义，实现全局信息高效传递，并开发CUDA推理函数优化性能。

Result: OctreeNCA在评估时VRAM占用比UNet少90%，能一次性处理184兆像素病理切片或1分钟手术视频。

Conclusion: OctreeNCA为高分辨率医学图像分割提供了一种高效、低资源占用的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical applications demand segmentation of large inputs, like prostate MRIs,
pathology slices, or videos of surgery. These inputs should ideally be inferred
at once to provide the model with proper spatial or temporal context. When
segmenting large inputs, the VRAM consumption of the GPU becomes the
bottleneck. Architectures like UNets or Vision Transformers scale very poorly
in VRAM consumption, resulting in patch- or frame-wise approaches that
compromise global consistency and inference speed. The lightweight Neural
Cellular Automaton (NCA) is a bio-inspired model that is by construction
size-invariant. However, due to its local-only communication rules, it lacks
global knowledge. We propose OctreeNCA by generalizing the neighborhood
definition using an octree data structure. Our generalized neighborhood
definition enables the efficient traversal of global knowledge. Since deep
learning frameworks are mainly developed for large multi-layer networks, their
implementation does not fully leverage the advantages of NCAs. We implement an
NCA inference function in CUDA that further reduces VRAM demands and increases
inference speed. Our OctreeNCA segments high-resolution images and videos
quickly while occupying 90% less VRAM than a UNet during evaluation. This
allows us to segment 184 Megapixel pathology slices or 1-minute surgical videos
at once.

Method: 提出UniAP算法快速生成伪掩码，并设计S2-UniSeg模型，结合QuerySD任务进行连续预训练。

Result: S2-UniSeg在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法，如COCO上AP提升6.9。

Conclusion: S2-UniSeg通过高效伪掩码生成和连续优化，实现了高性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: Recent self-supervised image segmentation models have achieved promising
performance on semantic segmentation and class-agnostic instance segmentation.
However, their pretraining schedule is multi-stage, requiring a time-consuming
pseudo-masks generation process between each training epoch. This
time-consuming offline process not only makes it difficult to scale with
training dataset size, but also leads to sub-optimal solutions due to its
discontinuous optimization routine. To solve these, we first present a novel
pseudo-mask algorithm, Fast Universal Agglomerative Pooling (UniAP). Each layer
of UniAP can identify groups of similar nodes in parallel, allowing to generate
both semantic-level and instance-level and multi-granular pseudo-masks within
ens of milliseconds for one image. Based on the fast UniAP, we propose the
Scalable Self-Supervised Universal Segmentation (S2-UniSeg), which employs a
student and a momentum teacher for continuous pretraining. A novel
segmentation-oriented pretext task, Query-wise Self-Distillation (QuerySD), is
proposed to pretrain S2-UniSeg to learn the local-to-global correspondences.
Under the same setting, S2-UniSeg outperforms the SOTA UnSAM model, achieving
notable improvements of AP+6.9 on COCO, AR+11.1 on UVO, PixelAcc+4.5 on
COCOStuff-27, RQ+8.0 on Cityscapes. After scaling up to a larger 2M-image
subset of SA-1B, S2-UniSeg further achieves performance gains on all four
benchmarks. Our code and pretrained models are available at

Motivation: 高分辨率文本到图像生成模型的兴起为SVBRDF生成提供了机会，但如何高效生成多贴图并保持一致性仍具挑战。

Method: 引入HiMat框架和CrossStitch模块，通过轻量级卷积操作捕捉贴图间依赖关系，不改变DiT主干结构。

Result: 实验表明HiMat能生成具有结构一致性和高频细节的4K SVBRDF贴图，并可推广到其他任务如本征分解。

Conclusion: HiMat为高效生成高质量SVBRDF提供了一种轻量级解决方案，同时保留了模型的先验能力。

Abstract: Creating highly detailed SVBRDFs is essential for 3D content creation. The
rise of high-resolution text-to-image generative models, based on diffusion
transformers (DiT), suggests an opportunity to finetune them for this task.
However, retargeting the models to produce multiple aligned SVBRDF maps instead
of just RGB images, while achieving high efficiency and ensuring consistency
across different maps, remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce HiMat:
a memory- and computation-efficient diffusion-based framework capable of
generating native 4K-resolution SVBRDFs. A key challenge we address is
maintaining consistency across different maps in a lightweight manner, without
relying on training new VAEs or significantly altering the DiT backbone (which
would damage its prior capabilities). To tackle this, we introduce the
CrossStitch module, a lightweight convolutional module that captures inter-map
dependencies through localized operations. Its weights are initialized such
that the DiT backbone operation is unchanged before finetuning starts. HiMat
enables generation with strong structural coherence and high-frequency details.
Results with a large set of text prompts demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach for 4K SVBRDF generation. Further experiments suggest generalization
to tasks such as intrinsic decomposition.

Result: TerraMAE在高保真图像重建中表现出色，并在作物识别、土地覆盖分类和土壤纹理预测任务中取得优异性能。

Conclusion: TerraMAE为高光谱图像分析提供了高效的自监督学习解决方案，具有广泛的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Hyperspectral satellite imagery offers sub-30 m views of Earth in hundreds of
contiguous spectral bands, enabling fine-grained mapping of soils, crops, and
land cover. While self-supervised Masked Autoencoders excel on RGB and low-band
multispectral data, they struggle to exploit the intricate spatial-spectral
correlations in 200+ band hyperspectral images. We introduce TerraMAE, a novel
HSI encoding framework specifically designed to learn highly representative
spatial-spectral embeddings for diverse geospatial analyses. TerraMAE features
an adaptive channel grouping strategy, based on statistical reflectance
properties to capture spectral similarities, and an enhanced reconstruction
loss function that incorporates spatial and spectral quality metrics. We
demonstrate TerraMAE's effectiveness through superior spatial-spectral
information preservation in high-fidelity image reconstruction. Furthermore, we
validate its practical utility and the quality of its learned representations
through strong performance on three key downstream geospatial tasks: crop
identification, land cover classification, and soil texture prediction.

system comprising six specialized and collaborative agents: Layout & Structure
Analysis, Multimodal Content Understanding, Instruction Decomposition, Content
Refinement, Summarization & Generation, and Fidelity & Consistency
Verification. This closed-loop feedback architecture ensures high semantic

Abstract: Complex Visual Question Answering (Complex VQA) tasks, which demand
sophisticated multi-modal reasoning and external knowledge integration, present
significant challenges for existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) often
limited by their reliance on high-level global features. To address this, we
propose MV-CoRe (Multimodal Visual-Conceptual Reasoning), a novel model

object detection characteristics and scene graph representations. An innovative
Multimodal Fusion Transformer then processes and deeply integrates these
diverse feature sets, enabling rich cross-modal attention and facilitating
complex reasoning. We evaluate MV-CoRe on challenging Complex VQA benchmarks,
including GQA, A-OKVQA, and OKVQA, after training on VQAv2. Our experimental
results demonstrate that MV-CoRe consistently outperforms established LVLM
baselines, achieving an overall accuracy of 77.5% on GQA. Ablation studies

Abstract: Accurate endoscopic image segmentation on the polyps is critical for early
colorectal cancer detection. However, this task remains challenging due to low
contrast with surrounding mucosa, specular highlights, and indistinct
boundaries. To address these challenges, we propose FOCUS-Med, which stands for
Fusion of spatial and structural graph with attentional context-aware polyp
segmentation in endoscopic medical imaging. FOCUS-Med integrates a Dual Graph
Convolutional Network (Dual-GCN) module to capture contextual spatial and
topological structural dependencies. This graph-based representation enables
the model to better distinguish polyps from background tissues by leveraging
topological cues and spatial connectivity, which are often obscured in raw
image intensities. It enhances the model's ability to preserve boundaries and
delineate complex shapes typical of polyps. In addition, a location-fused
stand-alone self-attention is employed to strengthen global context
integration. To bridge the semantic gap between encoder-decoder layers, we
incorporate a trainable weighted fast normalized fusion strategy for efficient
multi-scale aggregation. Notably, we are the first to introduce the use of a
Large Language Model (LLM) to provide detailed qualitative evaluations of
segmentation quality. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate
that FOCUS-Med achieves state-of-the-art performance across five key metrics,
underscoring its effectiveness and clinical potential for AI-assisted
colonoscopy.

Motivation: 现有3D表示（如点云、网格和3D高斯）在渲染质量、表面定义和压缩性方面存在不足，需要一种更高效的3D表示方法。

Result: TeSO在较低比特率下实现了比点云和3D高斯基线更高的渲染质量。

Conclusion: TeSO是一种高效且高质量的3D表示方法，适用于3D流媒体应用。

Abstract: 3D visual content streaming is a key technology for emerging 3D telepresence
and AR/VR applications. One fundamental element underlying the technology is a
versatile 3D representation that is capable of producing high-quality renders
and can be efficiently compressed at the same time. Existing 3D representations
like point clouds, meshes and 3D Gaussians each have limitations in terms of
rendering quality, surface definition, and compressibility. In this paper, we
present the Textured Surfel Octree (TeSO), a novel 3D representation that is
built from point clouds but addresses the aforementioned limitations. It
represents a 3D scene as cube-bounded surfels organized on an octree, where
each surfel is further associated with a texture patch. By approximating a
smooth surface with a large surfel at a coarser level of the octree, it reduces
the number of primitives required to represent the 3D scene, and yet retains
the high-frequency texture details through the texture map attached to each
surfel. We further propose a compression scheme to encode the geometry and
texture efficiently, leveraging the octree structure. The proposed textured
surfel octree combined with the compression scheme achieves higher rendering
quality at lower bit-rates compared to multiple point cloud and 3D
Gaussian-based baselines.

Conclusion: ForeSight通过联合检测与预测，显著提升了自动驾驶3D感知的性能，且无需显式目标关联。

Abstract: We introduce ForeSight, a novel joint detection and forecasting framework for
vision-based 3D perception in autonomous vehicles. Traditional approaches treat
detection and forecasting as separate sequential tasks, limiting their ability
to leverage temporal cues. ForeSight addresses this limitation with a
multi-task streaming and bidirectional learning approach, allowing detection
and forecasting to share query memory and propagate information seamlessly. The
forecast-aware detection transformer enhances spatial reasoning by integrating
trajectory predictions from a multiple hypothesis forecast memory queue, while
the streaming forecast transformer improves temporal consistency using past
forecasts and refined detections. Unlike tracking-based methods, ForeSight
eliminates the need for explicit object association, reducing error propagation
with a tracking-free model that efficiently scales across multi-frame
sequences. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that ForeSight achieves
state-of-the-art performance, achieving an EPA of 54.9%, surpassing previous
methods by 9.3%, while also attaining the best mAP and minADE among multi-view
detection and forecasting models.

Abstract: Collaborative 3D detection can substantially boost detection performance by
allowing agents to exchange complementary information. It inherently results in
a fundamental trade-off between detection performance and communication
bandwidth. To tackle this bottleneck issue, we propose a novel hybrid
collaboration that adaptively integrates two types of communication messages:
perceptual outputs, which are compact, and raw observations, which offer richer
information. This approach focuses on two key aspects: i) integrating
complementary information from two message types and ii) prioritizing the most
critical data within each type. By adaptively selecting the most critical set
of messages, it ensures optimal perceptual information and adaptability,
effectively meeting the demands of diverse communication scenarios.Building on
this hybrid collaboration, we present \texttt{HyComm}, a
communication-efficient LiDAR-based collaborative 3D detection system.
\texttt{HyComm} boasts two main benefits: i) it facilitates adaptable
compression rates for messages, addressing various communication requirements,
and ii) it uses standardized data formats for messages. This ensures they are
independent of specific detection models, fostering adaptability across
different agent configurations. To evaluate HyComm, we conduct experiments on
both real-world and simulation datasets: DAIR-V2X and OPV2V. HyComm
consistently outperforms previous methods and achieves a superior
performance-bandwidth trade-off regardless of whether agents use the same or
varied detection models. It achieves a lower communication volume of more than
2,006$\times$ and still outperforms Where2comm on DAIR-V2X in terms of AP50.
The related code will be released.

TL;DR: AugLift通过增强2D关键点输入（加入置信度分数和深度估计）显著提升3D人体姿态估计的泛化性能，无需额外数据或传感器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提升的3D姿态估计方法在新数据集和实际场景中泛化能力差，AugLift旨在解决这一问题。

Method: AugLift在标准2D关键点坐标基础上稀疏增强置信度分数和深度估计，利用预训练模型计算这些信号。

Result: 实验表明，AugLift在未见数据集上平均提升10.1%性能，在分布内数据上提升4.0%。

Conclusion: AugLift是一种模块化方法，能显著提升任何基于提升的姿态估计模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Lifting-based methods for 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE), which predict 3D
poses from detected 2D keypoints, often generalize poorly to new datasets and
real-world settings. To address this, we propose \emph{AugLift}, a simple yet
effective reformulation of the standard lifting pipeline that significantly
improves generalization performance without requiring additional data
collection or sensors. AugLift sparsely enriches the standard input -- the 2D
keypoint coordinates $(x, y)$ -- by augmenting it with a keypoint detection
confidence score $c$ and a corresponding depth estimate $d$. These additional
signals are computed from the image using off-the-shelf, pre-trained models
(e.g., for monocular depth estimation), thereby inheriting their strong
generalization capabilities. Importantly, AugLift serves as a modular add-on
and can be readily integrated into existing lifting architectures.
  Our extensive experiments across four datasets demonstrate that AugLift
boosts cross-dataset performance on unseen datasets by an average of $10.1\%$,
while also improving in-distribution performance by $4.0\%$. These gains are
consistent across various lifting architectures, highlighting the robustness of
our method. Our analysis suggests that these sparse, keypoint-aligned cues
provide robust frame-level context, offering a practical way to significantly
improve the generalization of any lifting-based pose estimation model. Code
will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 生成模型在医学影像中潜力巨大，但合成图像的质量和临床实用性仍需验证。研究评估了GAN和扩散模型在合成胸部X光片中的表现，发现扩散模型视觉更真实，而GAN在某些条件下更准确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学影像数据稀缺问题，尤其是低发病率异常，同时验证合成图像的临床实用性。

Method: 使用GAN和扩散模型合成胸部X光片，基于MIMIC-CXR数据集进行真实与合成图像的对比研究，邀请三位放射科医生参与评估。

Result: 扩散模型生成图像更真实，而GAN在特定条件下（如无ECS）更准确。研究还揭示了放射科医生识别合成图像的视觉线索。

Conclusion: GAN和扩散模型各有优势，需进一步优化以可靠地增强AI诊断系统的训练数据。

Abstract: Generative image models have achieved remarkable progress in both natural and
medical imaging. In the medical context, these techniques offer a potential
solution to data scarcity-especially for low-prevalence anomalies that impair
the performance of AI-driven diagnostic and segmentation tools. However,
questions remain regarding the fidelity and clinical utility of synthetic
images, since poor generation quality can undermine model generalizability and
trust. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of state-of-the-art
generative models-Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models
(DMs)-for synthesizing chest X-rays conditioned on four abnormalities:
Atelectasis (AT), Lung Opacity (LO), Pleural Effusion (PE), and Enlarged
Cardiac Silhouette (ECS). Using a benchmark composed of real images from the
MIMIC-CXR dataset and synthetic images from both GANs and DMs, we conducted a
reader study with three radiologists of varied experience. Participants were
asked to distinguish real from synthetic images and assess the consistency
between visual features and the target abnormality. Our results show that while
DMs generate more visually realistic images overall, GANs can report better
accuracy for specific conditions, such as absence of ECS. We further identify
visual cues radiologists use to detect synthetic images, offering insights into
the perceptual gaps in current models. These findings underscore the
complementary strengths of GANs and DMs and point to the need for further
refinement to ensure generative models can reliably augment training datasets
for AI diagnostic systems.

Conclusion: CMAMRNet为壁画修复提供了高效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Murals, as invaluable cultural artifacts, face continuous deterioration from
environmental factors and human activities. Digital restoration of murals faces
unique challenges due to their complex degradation patterns and the critical
need to preserve artistic authenticity. Existing learning-based methods
struggle with maintaining consistent mask guidance throughout their networks,
leading to insufficient focus on damaged regions and compromised restoration
quality. We propose CMAMRNet, a Contextual Mask-Aware Mural Restoration Network
that addresses these limitations through comprehensive mask guidance and
multi-scale feature extraction. Our framework introduces two key components:
(1) the Mask-Aware Up/Down-Sampler (MAUDS), which ensures consistent mask
sensitivity across resolution scales through dedicated channel-wise feature
selection and mask-guided feature fusion; and (2) the Co-Feature Aggregator
(CFA), operating at both the highest and lowest resolutions to extract
complementary features for capturing fine textures and global structures in
degraded regions. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
CMAMRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods, effectively preserving both
structural integrity and artistic details in restored murals. The code is

Motivation: 大型HVM依赖大规模预训练数据和复杂架构，限制了实际应用。DPAL旨在解决这一问题，通过知识蒸馏提升轻量级模型的泛化能力。

Method: 设计了动态模式解码器（D-PaDe）作为动态专家混合模型，提取典型视觉模式，并通过三个对齐目标（全局、局部和实例关系）缩小轻量级与大型HVM的泛化差距。

Result: 在15个数据集上的实验表明，DPAL-ViT/Ti（5M参数）表现优异，泛化能力接近大型HVM（如PATH-B和Sapiens-L），并显著优于其他蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: DPAL通过动态模式对齐学习，成功提升了轻量级HVM的泛化能力，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Human-centric vision models (HVMs) have achieved remarkable generalization
due to large-scale pretraining on massive person images. However, their
dependence on large neural architectures and the restricted accessibility of
pretraining data significantly limits their practicality in real-world
applications. To address this limitation, we propose Dynamic Pattern Alignment
Learning (DPAL), a novel distillation-based pretraining framework that
efficiently trains lightweight HVMs to acquire strong generalization from large
HVMs. In particular, human-centric visual perception are highly dependent on
three typical visual patterns, including global identity pattern, local shape
pattern and multi-person interaction pattern. To achieve generalizable
lightweight HVMs, we firstly design a dynamic pattern decoder (D-PaDe), acting
as a dynamic Mixture of Expert (MoE) model. It incorporates three specialized
experts dedicated to adaptively extract typical visual patterns, conditioned on
both input image and pattern queries. And then, we present three levels of
alignment objectives, which aims to minimize generalization gap between
lightweight HVMs and large HVMs at global image level, local pixel level, and
instance relation level. With these two deliberate designs, the DPAL
effectively guides lightweight model to learn all typical human visual patterns
from large HVMs, which can generalize to various human-centric vision tasks.
Extensive experiments conducted on 15 challenging datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the DPAL. Remarkably, when employing PATH-B as the teacher,
DPAL-ViT/Ti (5M parameters) achieves surprising generalizability similar to
existing large HVMs such as PATH-B (84M) and Sapiens-L (307M), and outperforms
previous distillation-based pretraining methods including Proteus-ViT/Ti (5M)
and TinyMiM-ViT/Ti (5M) by a large margin.

Conclusion: 结合意图建模的扩散框架能有效提升行人轨迹预测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Predicting pedestrian motion trajectories is critical for the path planning
and motion control of autonomous vehicles. Recent diffusion-based models have
shown promising results in capturing the inherent stochasticity of pedestrian
behavior for trajectory prediction. However, the absence of explicit semantic
modelling of pedestrian intent in many diffusion-based methods may result in
misinterpreted behaviors and reduced prediction accuracy. To address the above
challenges, we propose a diffusion-based pedestrian trajectory prediction
framework that incorporates both short-term and long-term motion intentions.
Short-term intent is modelled using a residual polar representation, which
decouples direction and magnitude to capture fine-grained local motion
patterns. Long-term intent is estimated through a learnable, token-based
endpoint predictor that generates multiple candidate goals with associated
probabilities, enabling multimodal and context-aware intention modelling.
Furthermore, we enhance the diffusion process by incorporating adaptive
guidance and a residual noise predictor that dynamically refines denoising
accuracy. The proposed framework is evaluated on the widely used ETH, UCY, and
SDD benchmarks, demonstrating competitive results against state-of-the-art
methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SketchAnimator的模型，通过三个阶段为静态草图添加动态效果，使其能够模仿参考视频的动作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 草图动画化通常需要专业技能且耗时，业余用户难以完成。本文旨在简化这一过程，使草图动画化更易实现。

Method: 分为三个阶段：外观学习、动作学习和视频先验蒸馏。利用LoRA和SDS技术，将草图外观和参考视频动作信息整合到预训练模型中。

Result: 模型生成的草图视频既保留了原始外观，又模仿了参考视频的动态动作，优于其他方法。

Conclusion: SketchAnimator在一次性动作定制任务中表现出色，为草图动画化提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Sketching is a uniquely human tool for expressing ideas and creativity. The
animation of sketches infuses life into these static drawings, opening a new
dimension for designers. Animating sketches is a time-consuming process that
demands professional skills and extensive experience, often proving daunting
for amateurs. In this paper, we propose a novel sketch animation model
SketchAnimator, which enables adding creative motion to a given sketch, like "a
jumping car''. Namely, given an input sketch and a reference video, we divide
the sketch animation into three stages: Appearance Learning, Motion Learning
and Video Prior Distillation. In stages 1 and 2, we utilize LoRA to integrate
sketch appearance information and motion dynamics from the reference video into
the pre-trained T2V model. In the third stage, we utilize Score Distillation
Sampling (SDS) to update the parameters of the Bezier curves in each sketch
frame according to the acquired motion information. Consequently, our model
produces a sketch video that not only retains the original appearance of the
sketch but also mirrors the dynamic movements of the reference video. We
compare our method with alternative approaches and demonstrate that it
generates the desired sketch video under the challenge of one-shot motion
customization.

Result: 在BEHAVE和Human-object Interaction数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CoopDiff通过解耦建模和接触点一致性，显著提升了3D人-物交互预测的性能。

Abstract: 3D human-object interaction (HOI) anticipation aims to predict the future
motion of humans and their manipulated objects, conditioned on the historical
context. Generally, the articulated humans and rigid objects exhibit different
motion patterns, due to their distinct intrinsic physical properties. However,
this distinction is ignored by most of the existing works, which intend to
capture the dynamics of both humans and objects within a single prediction
model. In this work, we propose a novel contact-consistent decoupled diffusion
framework CoopDiff, which employs two distinct branches to decouple human and
object motion modeling, with the human-object contact points as shared anchors
to bridge the motion generation across branches. The human dynamics branch is
aimed to predict highly structured human motion, while the object dynamics
branch focuses on the object motion with rigid translations and rotations.
These two branches are bridged by a series of shared contact points with
consistency constraint for coherent human-object motion prediction. To further
enhance human-object consistency and prediction reliability, we propose a
human-driven interaction module to guide object motion modeling. Extensive
experiments on the BEHAVE and Human-object Interaction datasets demonstrate
that our CoopDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: In the domain of computer vision, multi-scale feature extraction is vital for
tasks such as salient object detection. However, achieving this capability in
lightweight networks remains challenging due to the trade-off between
efficiency and performance. This paper proposes a novel lightweight multi-scale
feature extraction layer, termed the LMF layer, which employs depthwise
separable dilated convolutions in a fully connected structure. By integrating
multiple LMF layers, we develop LMFNet, a lightweight network tailored for
salient object detection. Our approach significantly reduces the number of
parameters while maintaining competitive performance. Here, we show that LMFNet
achieves state-of-the-art or comparable results on five benchmark datasets with
only 0.81M parameters, outperforming several traditional and lightweight models
in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. Our work not only addresses the
challenge of multi-scale learning in lightweight networks but also demonstrates
the potential for broader applications in image processing tasks. The related

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RVOS方法忽视表达式的语义结构，且视频引用表达式比图像更复杂，包含事件属性和时间关系，传统方法难以处理。

Method: EventRR框架分为对象摘要和引用推理两部分：摘要阶段生成瓶颈令牌并聚合全局跨模态时间上下文；推理阶段通过REG提取语义结构，并采用TCRR进行推理。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，EventRR在定量和定性上均优于现有RVOS方法。

Conclusion: EventRR通过结构化语义推理有效解决了复杂视频引用表达式的挑战，为RVOS领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment out the object in
a video referred by an expression. Current RVOS methods view referring
expressions as unstructured sequences, neglecting their crucial semantic
structure essential for referent reasoning. Besides, in contrast to
image-referring expressions whose semantics focus only on object attributes and
object-object relations, video-referring expressions also encompass event
attributes and event-event temporal relations. This complexity challenges
traditional structured reasoning image approaches. In this paper, we propose
the Event Referential Reasoning (EventRR) framework. EventRR decouples RVOS
into object summarization part and referent reasoning part. The summarization
phase begins by summarizing each frame into a set of bottleneck tokens, which
are then efficiently aggregated in the video-level summarization step to
exchange the global cross-modal temporal context. For reasoning part, EventRR
extracts semantic eventful structure of a video-referring expression into
highly expressive Referential Event Graph (REG), which is a single-rooted
directed acyclic graph. Guided by topological traversal of REG, we propose
Temporal Concept-Role Reasoning (TCRR) to accumulate the referring score of
each temporal query from REG leaf nodes to root node. Each reasoning step can
be interpreted as a question-answer pair derived from the concept-role
relations in REG. Extensive experiments across four widely recognized benchmark
datasets, show that EventRR quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms
state-of-the-art RVOS methods. Code is available at

Result: 在多个标准基准上达到最优性能，并能泛化到未见过的植物图像。

Conclusion: DGN通过深度引导显著提升了图像恢复质量，新数据集为训练和评估提供了丰富资源。

Abstract: Image restoration has seen substantial progress in recent years. However,
existing methods often neglect depth information, which hurts similarity
matching, results in attention distractions in shallow depth-of-field (DoF)
scenarios, and excessive enhancement of background content in deep DoF
settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Depth-Guided
Network (DGN) for image restoration, together with a novel large-scale
high-resolution dataset. Specifically, the network consists of two interactive
branches: a depth estimation branch that provides structural guidance, and an
image restoration branch that performs the core restoration task. In addition,
the image restoration branch exploits intra-object similarity through
progressive window-based self-attention and captures inter-object similarity
via sparse non-local attention. Through joint training, depth features
contribute to improved restoration quality, while the enhanced visual features
from the restoration branch in turn help refine depth estimation. Notably, we
also introduce a new dataset for training and evaluation, consisting of 9,205
high-resolution images from 403 plant species, with diverse depth and texture
variations. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on several standard benchmarks and generalizes
well to unseen plant images, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: 该方法有效捕捉真实退化，提升了超分辨率在真实场景中的表现。

Abstract: Unsupervised real-world super-resolution (SR) faces critical challenges due
to the complex, unknown degradation distributions in practical scenarios.
Existing methods struggle to generalize from synthetic low-resolution (LR) and
high-resolution (HR) image pairs to real-world data due to a significant domain
gap. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised real-world SR method based on
rectified flow to effectively capture and model real-world degradation,
synthesizing LR-HR training pairs with realistic degradation. Specifically,
given unpaired LR and HR images, we propose a novel Rectified Flow Degradation
Module (RFDM) that introduces degradation-transformed LR (DT-LR) images as
intermediaries. By modeling the degradation trajectory in a continuous and
invertible manner, RFDM better captures real-world degradation and enhances the
realism of generated LR images. Additionally, we propose a Fourier Prior Guided
Degradation Module (FGDM) that leverages structural information embedded in
Fourier phase components to ensure more precise modeling of real-world
degradation. Finally, the LR images are processed by both FGDM and RFDM,
producing final synthetic LR images with real-world degradation. The synthetic
LR images are paired with the given HR images to train the off-the-shelf SR
networks. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method significantly enhances the performance of existing SR approaches in
real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 现有IML模型主要依赖视觉线索，忽略了内容特征间的语义逻辑关系。篡改技术通常会破坏内容特征的内部关系，留下语义线索。

Method: CMB-Net利用LLMs分析篡改区域并生成文本信息，通过ITCAM模块量化文本与图像特征的模糊性，ITIM模块对齐视觉与文本特征，RED模块保留边界信息。

Result: 实验表明CMB-Net优于现有IML模型。

Conclusion: CMB-Net通过结合语义和视觉信息，有效提升了IML的准确性。

Abstract: The existing image manipulation localization (IML) models mainly relies on
visual cues, but ignores the semantic logical relationships between content
features. In fact, the content semantics conveyed by real images often conform
to human cognitive laws. However, image manipulation technology usually
destroys the internal relationship between content features, thus leaving
semantic clues for IML. In this paper, we propose a cognition-inspired
multimodal boundary-preserving network (CMB-Net). Specifically, CMB-Net
utilizes large language models (LLMs) to analyze manipulated regions within
images and generate prompt-based textual information to compensate for the lack
of semantic relationships in the visual information. Considering that the
erroneous texts induced by hallucination from LLMs will damage the accuracy of
IML, we propose an image-text central ambiguity module (ITCAM). It assigns
weights to the text features by quantifying the ambiguity between text and
image features, thereby ensuring the beneficial impact of textual information.
We also propose an image-text interaction module (ITIM) that aligns visual and
text features using a correlation matrix for fine-grained interaction. Finally,
inspired by invertible neural networks, we propose a restoration edge decoder
(RED) that mutually generates input and output features to preserve boundary
information in manipulated regions without loss. Extensive experiments show
that CMB-Net outperforms most existing IML models.

Abstract: Offline camera calibration techniques typically employ parametric or generic
camera models. Selecting parametric models relies heavily on user experience,
and an inappropriate camera model can significantly affect calibration
accuracy. Meanwhile, generic calibration methods involve complex procedures and
cannot provide traditional intrinsic parameters. This paper reveals a pose
ambiguity in the pose solutions of generic calibration methods that
irreversibly impacts subsequent pose estimation. A linear solver and a
nonlinear optimization are proposed to address this ambiguity issue. Then a
global optimization hybrid calibration method is introduced to integrate
generic and parametric models together, which improves extrinsic parameter
accuracy of generic calibration and mitigates overfitting and numerical
instability in parametric calibration. Simulation and real-world experimental
results demonstrate that the generic-parametric hybrid calibration method
consistently excels across various lens types and noise contamination,
hopefully serving as a reliable and accurate solution for camera calibration in
complex scenarios.

Abstract: Visual speech recognition is a technique to identify spoken content in silent
speech videos, which has raised significant attention in recent years.
Advancements in data-driven deep learning methods have significantly improved
both the speed and accuracy of recognition. However, these deep learning
methods can be effected by visual disturbances, such as lightning conditions,
skin texture and other user-specific features. Data-driven approaches could
reduce the performance degradation caused by these visual disturbances using
models pretrained on large-scale datasets. But these methods often require
large amounts of training data and computational resources, making them costly.
To reduce the influence of user-specific features and enhance performance with
limited data, this paper proposed a landmark guided visual feature extractor.
Facial landmarks are used as auxiliary information to aid in training the
visual feature extractor. A spatio-temporal multi-graph convolutional network
is designed to fully exploit the spatial locations and spatio-temporal features
of facial landmarks. Additionally, a multi-level lip dynamic fusion framework
is introduced to combine the spatio-temporal features of the landmarks with the
visual features extracted from the raw video frames. Experimental results show
that this approach performs well with limited data and also improves the

*Bo Wang,Mengyuan Xu,Yue Yan,Yuqun Yang,Kechen Shu,Wei Ping,Xu Tang,Wei Jiang,Zheng You*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASM-UNet是一种基于Mamba的新型架构，用于细粒度分割（FGS），通过自适应扫描顺序提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有粗粒度分割方法在细粒度分割中表现不佳，且现有Mamba模型依赖固定扫描顺序，无法适应个体差异。

Method: 提出ASM-UNet，结合群体共性和个体差异生成自适应扫描分数，动态调整扫描顺序。

Result: 在ACDC、Synapse和BTMS数据集上，ASM-UNet在粗粒度和细粒度分割任务中均表现优异。

Conclusion: ASM-UNet通过自适应扫描顺序解决了细粒度分割中的个体差异问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Precise lesion resection depends on accurately identifying fine-grained
anatomical structures. While many coarse-grained segmentation (CGS) methods
have been successful in large-scale segmentation (e.g., organs), they fall
short in clinical scenarios requiring fine-grained segmentation (FGS), which
remains challenging due to frequent individual variations in small-scale
anatomical structures. Although recent Mamba-based models have advanced medical
image segmentation, they often rely on fixed manually-defined scanning orders,
which limit their adaptability to individual variations in FGS. To address
this, we propose ASM-UNet, a novel Mamba-based architecture for FGS. It
introduces adaptive scan scores to dynamically guide the scanning order,
generated by combining group-level commonalities and individual-level
variations. Experiments on two public datasets (ACDC and Synapse) and a newly
proposed challenging biliary tract FGS dataset, namely BTMS, demonstrate that
ASM-UNet achieves superior performance in both CGS and FGS tasks. Our code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/YqunYang/ASM-UNet.

TL;DR: MiraMo框架通过高效线性注意力、运动残差学习和DCT噪声优化，提升了图像动画的效率和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像动画中外观一致性和运动平滑性的挑战，同时减少计算资源需求。

Method: 采用线性注意力替代传统自注意力，引入运动残差学习和DCT噪声优化策略。

Result: 实验证明MiraMo在生成一致性高、平滑且可控的动画方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MiraMo为图像动画提供了高效、高质量的解决方案，并展示了在运动迁移和视频编辑中的潜力。

Abstract: Image animation has seen significant progress, driven by the powerful
generative capabilities of diffusion models. However, maintaining appearance
consistency with static input images and mitigating abrupt motion transitions
in generated animations remain persistent challenges. While text-to-video (T2V)
generation has demonstrated impressive performance with diffusion transformer
models, the image animation field still largely relies on U-Net-based diffusion
models, which lag behind the latest T2V approaches. Moreover, the quadratic
complexity of vanilla self-attention mechanisms in Transformers imposes heavy
computational demands, making image animation particularly resource-intensive.
To address these issues, we propose MiraMo, a framework designed to enhance
efficiency, appearance consistency, and motion smoothness in image animation.
Specifically, MiraMo introduces three key elements: (1) A foundational
text-to-video architecture replacing vanilla self-attention with efficient
linear attention to reduce computational overhead while preserving generation
quality; (2) A novel motion residual learning paradigm that focuses on modeling
motion dynamics rather than directly predicting frames, improving temporal
consistency; and (3) A DCT-based noise refinement strategy during inference to
suppress sudden motion artifacts, complemented by a dynamics control module to
balance motion smoothness and expressiveness. Extensive experiments against
state-of-the-art methods validate the superiority of MiraMo in generating
consistent, smooth, and controllable animations with accelerated inference
speed. Additionally, we demonstrate the versatility of MiraMo through
applications in motion transfer and video editing tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于Transformer和集合论的光谱交互方法，用于提升高光谱视频跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注空间交互，忽略了光谱交互，导致性能不佳。

Method: 通过Transformer建立波段间空间关系，利用集合论的包含-排除原理建模光谱交互，并引入光谱损失函数。

Result: 实验表明，该方法实现了最先进的跟踪性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效整合了共享和波段特定的空间线索，提升了跟踪的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Hyperspectral videos (HSVs), with their inherent spatial-spectral-temporal
structure, offer distinct advantages in challenging tracking scenarios such as
cluttered backgrounds and small objects. However, existing methods primarily
focus on spatial interactions between the template and search regions, often
overlooking spectral interactions, leading to suboptimal performance. To
address this issue, this paper investigates spectral interactions from both the
architectural and training perspectives. At the architectural level, we first
establish band-wise long-range spatial relationships between the template and
search regions using Transformers. We then model spectral interactions using
the inclusion-exclusion principle from set theory, treating them as the union
of spatial interactions across all bands. This enables the effective
integration of both shared and band-specific spatial cues. At the training
level, we introduce a spectral loss to enforce material distribution alignment
between the template and predicted regions, enhancing robustness to shape
deformation and appearance variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our tracker achieves state-of-the-art tracking performance. The source code,
trained models and results will be publicly available via

Motivation: 现有数据集缺乏统一的4D标注和任务驱动的评估协议，无法支持细粒度的时空推理，尤其是物体和人的运动及其交互。

Method: 提出了EgoDynamic4D数据集，包含RGB-D视频、相机位姿、实例掩码和4D边界框，并设计了12种动态QA任务。提出了一种端到端的时空推理框架，结合动态和静态场景信息。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在EgoDynamic4D上表现优于基线，验证了多模态时间建模的有效性。

Conclusion: EgoDynamic4D填补了动态场景理解的空白，提出的框架为细粒度时空推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding dynamic 4D scenes from an egocentric perspective-modeling
changes in 3D spatial structure over time-is crucial for human-machine
interaction, autonomous navigation, and embodied intelligence. While existing
egocentric datasets contain dynamic scenes, they lack unified 4D annotations
and task-driven evaluation protocols for fine-grained spatio-temporal
reasoning, especially on motion of objects and human, together with their
interactions. To address this gap, we introduce EgoDynamic4D, a novel QA
benchmark on highly dynamic scenes, comprising RGB-D video, camera poses,
globally unique instance masks, and 4D bounding boxes. We construct 927K QA
pairs accompanied by explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT), enabling verifiable,
step-by-step spatio-temporal reasoning. We design 12 dynamic QA tasks covering
agent motion, human-object interaction, trajectory prediction, relation
understanding, and temporal-causal reasoning, with fine-grained,
multidimensional metrics. To tackle these tasks, we propose an end-to-end
spatio-temporal reasoning framework that unifies dynamic and static scene
information, using instance-aware feature encoding, time and camera encoding,
and spatially adaptive down-sampling to compress large 4D scenes into token
sequences manageable by LLMs. Experiments on EgoDynamic4D show that our method
consistently outperforms baselines, validating the effectiveness of multimodal
temporal modeling for egocentric dynamic scene understanding.

Result: 实验证明SLC框架高效且适用于开源和闭源大型VLM，支持广泛个性化应用。

Conclusion: SLC是首个训练高效的框架，结合小型和大型VLM优势，推动个性化应用发展。

Abstract: Personalizing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to transform them into daily
assistants has emerged as a trending research direction. However, leading
companies like OpenAI continue to increase model size and develop complex
designs such as the chain of thought (CoT). While large VLMs are proficient in
complex multi-modal understanding, their high training costs and limited access
via paid APIs restrict direct personalization. Conversely, small VLMs are
easily personalized and freely available, but they lack sufficient reasoning
capabilities. Inspired by this, we propose a novel collaborative framework
named Small-Large Collaboration (SLC) for large VLM personalization, where the
small VLM is responsible for generating personalized information, while the
large model integrates this personalized information to deliver accurate
responses. To effectively incorporate personalized information, we develop a
test-time reflection strategy, preventing the potential hallucination of the
small VLM. Since SLC only needs to train a meta personalized small VLM for the
large VLMs, the overall process is training-efficient. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first training-efficient framework that supports both
open-source and closed-source large VLMs, enabling broader real-world
personalized applications. We conduct thorough experiments across various
benchmarks and large VLMs to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SLC
framework. The code will be released at https://github.com/Hhankyangg/SLC.

Method: 提出OpenHAIV框架，结合OOD检测、新类发现和增量持续微调，实现模型在开放世界中的自主知识获取与更新。

Result: OpenHAIV框架成功整合了多种技术，支持模型在开放世界环境中持续学习和更新。

Conclusion: OpenHAIV为开放世界识别提供了一种有效的解决方案，解决了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Substantial progress has been made in various techniques for open-world
recognition. Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods can effectively
distinguish between known and unknown classes in the data, while incremental
learning enables continuous model knowledge updates. However, in open-world
scenarios, these approaches still face limitations. Relying solely on OOD
detection does not facilitate knowledge updates in the model, and incremental
fine-tuning typically requires supervised conditions, which significantly
deviate from open-world settings. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes OpenHAIV, a novel framework that integrates OOD detection, new class
discovery, and incremental continual fine-tuning into a unified pipeline. This
framework allows models to autonomously acquire and update knowledge in
open-world environments. The proposed framework is available at

Conclusion: 该框架为DNNs的特征表示提供了更深入的见解，并揭示了其潜在的脆弱性和决策边界。

Abstract: Understanding internal feature representations of deep neural networks (DNNs)
is a fundamental step toward model interpretability. Inspired by neuroscience
methods that probe biological neurons using visual stimuli, recent deep
learning studies have employed Activation Maximization (AM) to synthesize
inputs that elicit strong responses from artificial neurons. In this work, we
propose a unified feature visualization framework applicable to both
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). Unlike
prior efforts that predominantly focus on the last output-layer neurons in
CNNs, we extend feature visualization to intermediate layers as well, offering
deeper insights into the hierarchical structure of learned feature
representations. Furthermore, we investigate how activation maximization can be
leveraged to generate adversarial examples, revealing potential vulnerabilities
and decision boundaries of DNNs. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach in both traditional CNNs and modern ViT, highlighting its
generalizability and interpretive value.

Result: 在多种医学图像分割任务中表现优异，尤其在BSL设置下，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SynMatch通过合成图像匹配伪标签，为标签稀缺问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Label scarcity remains a major challenge in deep learning-based medical image
segmentation. Recent studies use strong-weak pseudo supervision to leverage
unlabeled data. However, performance is often hindered by inconsistencies
between pseudo labels and their corresponding unlabeled images. In this work,
we propose \textbf{SynMatch}, a novel framework that sidesteps the need for
improving pseudo labels by synthesizing images to match them instead.
Specifically, SynMatch synthesizes images using texture and shape features
extracted from the same segmentation model that generates the corresponding
pseudo labels for unlabeled images. This design enables the generation of
highly consistent synthesized-image-pseudo-label pairs without requiring any
training parameters for image synthesis. We extensively evaluate SynMatch
across diverse medical image segmentation tasks under semi-supervised learning
(SSL), weakly-supervised learning (WSL), and barely-supervised learning (BSL)
settings with increasingly limited annotations. The results demonstrate that
SynMatch achieves superior performance, especially in the most challenging BSL
setting. For example, it outperforms the recent strong-weak pseudo
supervision-based method by 29.71\% and 10.05\% on the polyp segmentation task
with 5\% and 10\% scribble annotations, respectively. The code will be released

Abstract: Real-time semantic segmentation presents the dual challenge of designing
efficient architectures that capture large receptive fields for semantic
understanding while also refining detailed contours. Vision transformers model
long-range dependencies effectively but incur high computational cost. To
address these challenges, we introduce the Large Kernel Attention (LKA)
mechanism. Our proposed Bilateral Efficient Visual Attention Network (BEVANet)
expands the receptive field to capture contextual information and extracts
visual and structural features using Sparse Decomposed Large Separable Kernel
Attentions (SDLSKA). The Comprehensive Kernel Selection (CKS) mechanism
dynamically adapts the receptive field to further enhance performance.
Furthermore, the Deep Large Kernel Pyramid Pooling Module (DLKPPM) enriches
contextual features by synergistically combining dilated convolutions and large
kernel attention. The bilateral architecture facilitates frequent branch
communication, and the Boundary Guided Adaptive Fusion (BGAF) module enhances
boundary delineation by integrating spatial and semantic features under
boundary guidance. BEVANet achieves real-time segmentation at 33 FPS, yielding
79.3% mIoU without pretraining and 81.0% mIoU on Cityscapes after ImageNet
pretraining, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance. The code and model is

Result: DocR1在多页任务中达到最先进性能，同时在单页基准测试中表现稳定。

Conclusion: EviGRPO框架和DocR1模型在多页文档理解任务中表现出色，为有限监督下的高质量模型训练提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Understanding multi-page documents poses a significant challenge for
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as it requires fine-grained visual
comprehension and multi-hop reasoning across pages. While prior work has
explored reinforcement learning (RL) for enhancing advanced reasoning in MLLMs,
its application to multi-page document understanding remains underexplored. In
this paper, we introduce DocR1, an MLLM trained with a novel RL framework,
Evidence Page-Guided GRPO (EviGRPO). EviGRPO incorporates an evidence-aware
reward mechanism that promotes a coarse-to-fine reasoning strategy, guiding the
model to first retrieve relevant pages before generating answers. This training
paradigm enables us to build high-quality models with limited supervision. To
support this, we design a two-stage annotation pipeline and a curriculum
learning strategy, based on which we construct two datasets: EviBench, a
high-quality training set with 4.8k examples, and ArxivFullQA, an evaluation
benchmark with 8.6k QA pairs based on scientific papers. Extensive experiments
across a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate that DocR1 achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multi-page tasks, while consistently
maintaining strong results on single-page benchmarks.

Motivation: 传统图像描述方法依赖对象检测器或GCN，存在冗余信息、GCN构建困难和训练成本高的问题。

Method: RORPCap通过提取对象和关系词，结合预定义提示模板和Mamba映射网络，生成文本丰富的特征嵌入，用于GPT-2生成描述。

Result: 在MS-COCO数据集上，RORPCap仅需2.6小时训练，CIDEr得分120.5%，SPICE得分22.0%。

Conclusion: RORPCap在性能上与传统方法相当，但训练时间更短，展示了其作为图像描述替代方案的潜力。

Abstract: Image captioning aims to generate natural language descriptions for input
images in an open-form manner. To accurately generate descriptions related to
the image, a critical step in image captioning is to identify objects and
understand their relations within the image. Modern approaches typically
capitalize on object detectors or combine detectors with Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN). However, these models suffer from redundant detection
information, difficulty in GCN construction, and high training costs. To
address these issues, a Retrieval-based Objects and Relations Prompt for Image
Captioning (RORPCap) is proposed, inspired by the fact that image-text
retrieval can provide rich semantic information for input images. RORPCap
employs an Objects and relations Extraction Model to extract object and
relation words from the image. These words are then incorporate into predefined
prompt templates and encoded as prompt embeddings. Next, a Mamba-based mapping
network is designed to quickly map image embeddings extracted by CLIP to
visual-text embeddings. Finally, the resulting prompt embeddings and
visual-text embeddings are concatenated to form textual-enriched feature
embeddings, which are fed into a GPT-2 model for caption generation. Extensive
experiments conducted on the widely used MS-COCO dataset show that the RORPCap
requires only 2.6 hours under cross-entropy loss training, achieving 120.5%
CIDEr score and 22.0% SPICE score on the "Karpathy" test split. RORPCap
achieves comparable performance metrics to detector-based and GCN-based models
with the shortest training time and demonstrates its potential as an
alternative for image captioning.

Result: 在Referring Video Object Segmentation和Temporal Grounding任务中表现优异，尤其在复杂提示下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Planner-Refiner框架在复杂语言提示的视频-语言对齐任务中具有显著潜力。

Abstract: Vision-language alignment in video must address the complexity of language,
evolving interacting entities, their action chains, and semantic gaps between
language and vision. This work introduces Planner-Refiner, a framework to
overcome these challenges. Planner-Refiner bridges the semantic gap by
iteratively refining visual elements' space-time representation, guided by
language until semantic gaps are minimal. A Planner module schedules language
guidance by decomposing complex linguistic prompts into short sentence chains.
The Refiner processes each short sentence, a noun-phrase and verb-phrase pair,
to direct visual tokens' self-attention across space then time, achieving
efficient single-step refinement. A recurrent system chains these steps,
maintaining refined visual token representations. The final representation
feeds into task-specific heads for alignment generation. We demonstrate

TL;DR: CoAR是一种新型框架，通过冻结预训练参数，仅调整少量参数实现定制化图像生成，解决了现有方法的高成本和过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有定制化生成方法依赖全微调或适配器，成本高且易过拟合或遗忘，需探索更高效的方法。

Method: 采用Layerwise Multimodal Context Learning策略，学习特定主题表示，并引入正则化防止过拟合和语言漂移。

Result: CoAR在主题和风格个性化任务中表现优异，计算和内存效率显著提升，仅调整0.05%参数。

Conclusion: CoAR为定制化生成提供高效解决方案，性能与Proxy-Tuning相当，代码已开源。

Abstract: The unified autoregressive (AR) model excels at multimodal understanding and
generation, but its potential for customized image generation remains
underexplored. Existing customized generation methods rely on full fine-tuning
or adapters, making them costly and prone to overfitting or catastrophic
forgetting. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CoAR}, a novel framework for
injecting subject concepts into the unified AR models while keeping all
pre-trained parameters completely frozen. CoAR learns effective, specific
subject representations with only a minimal number of parameters using a
Layerwise Multimodal Context Learning strategy. To address overfitting and
language drift, we further introduce regularization that preserves the
pre-trained distribution and anchors context tokens to improve subject fidelity
and re-contextualization. Additionally, CoAR supports training-free subject
customization in a user-provided style. Experiments demonstrate that CoAR
achieves superior performance on both subject-driven personalization and style
personalization, while delivering significant gains in computational and memory
efficiency. Notably, CoAR tunes less than \textbf{0.05\%} of the parameters
while achieving competitive performance compared to recent Proxy-Tuning. Code:

TL;DR: SODiff是一种新颖的一步扩散模型，通过语义导向的预训练扩散模型有效去除JPEG伪影，显著提升恢复效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在JPEG高压缩比下难以恢复复杂纹理细节，导致输出过度平滑。

Method: SODiff结合语义对齐图像提示提取器（SAIPE）和质量因子感知时间预测器，优化扩散过程。

Result: 实验表明，SODiff在视觉质量和定量指标上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SODiff通过语义导向和自适应去噪策略，显著提升了JPEG伪影去除效果。

Abstract: JPEG, as a widely used image compression standard, often introduces severe
visual artifacts when achieving high compression ratios. Although existing deep
learning-based restoration methods have made considerable progress, they often
struggle to recover complex texture details, resulting in over-smoothed
outputs. To overcome these limitations, we propose SODiff, a novel and
efficient semantic-oriented one-step diffusion model for JPEG artifacts
removal. Our core idea is that effective restoration hinges on providing
semantic-oriented guidance to the pre-trained diffusion model, thereby fully
leveraging its powerful generative prior. To this end, SODiff incorporates a
semantic-aligned image prompt extractor (SAIPE). SAIPE extracts rich features
from low-quality (LQ) images and projects them into an embedding space
semantically aligned with that of the text encoder. Simultaneously, it
preserves crucial information for faithful reconstruction. Furthermore, we
propose a quality factor-aware time predictor that implicitly learns the
compression quality factor (QF) of the LQ image and adaptively selects the
optimal denoising start timestep for the diffusion process. Extensive
experimental results show that our SODiff outperforms recent leading methods in
both visual quality and quantitative metrics. Code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统2D高斯泼溅方法在大规模复杂城市场景中表现不佳，导致建筑物重建不完整。

Method: 利用低细节语义3D建筑模型初始化高斯，生成先验深度和法线图，并引入建筑物聚焦模式以减少高斯基元数量。

Result: 在城市场景数据集中，重建完整性提升20.5%，几何精度提升32.8%，高斯基元减少71.8%。

Conclusion: 语义建筑模型的整合为高斯泼溅在智慧城市和数字孪生等实际应用中提供了潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting (GS) have demonstrated its
effectiveness in photo-realistic rendering and 3D reconstruction. Among these,
2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) is particularly suitable for surface
reconstruction due to its flattened Gaussian representation and integrated
normal regularization. However, its performance often degrades in large-scale
and complex urban scenes with frequent occlusions, leading to incomplete
building reconstructions. We propose GS4Buildings, a novel prior-guided
Gaussian Splatting method leveraging the ubiquity of semantic 3D building
models for robust and scalable building surface reconstruction. Instead of
relying on traditional Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines, GS4Buildings
initializes Gaussians directly from low-level Level of Detail (LoD)2 semantic
3D building models. Moreover, we generate prior depth and normal maps from the
planar building geometry and incorporate them into the optimization process,
providing strong geometric guidance for surface consistency and structural
accuracy. We also introduce an optional building-focused mode that limits
reconstruction to building regions, achieving a 71.8% reduction in Gaussian
primitives and enabling a more efficient and compact representation.
Experiments on urban datasets demonstrate that GS4Buildings improves
reconstruction completeness by 20.5% and geometric accuracy by 32.8%. These
results highlight the potential of semantic building model integration to
advance GS-based reconstruction toward real-world urban applications such as
smart cities and digital twins. Our project is available:

Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在跨传感器数据上泛化能力差，传统方法耗时或需额外数据。

Method: 通过模块化分解模型，引入特征裁剪器，利用物理感知的无监督损失进行高效训练，并采用分块并行推理。

Result: 在跨传感器场景下实现高质量和高效处理，训练和推理速度远超现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在泛化能力和效率上均显著优于现有技术，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Deep learning methods for pansharpening have advanced rapidly, yet models
pretrained on data from a specific sensor often generalize poorly to data from
other sensors. Existing methods to tackle such cross-sensor degradation include
retraining model or zero-shot methods, but they are highly time-consuming or
even need extra training data. To address these challenges, our method first
performs modular decomposition on deep learning-based pansharpening models,
revealing a general yet critical interface where high-dimensional fused
features begin mapping to the channel space of the final image. % may need
revisement A Feature Tailor is then integrated at this interface to address
cross-sensor degradation at the feature level, and is trained efficiently with
physics-aware unsupervised losses. Moreover, our method operates in a
patch-wise manner, training on partial patches and performing parallel
inference on all patches to boost efficiency. Our method offers two key
advantages: (1) $\textit{Improved Generalization Ability}$: it significantly
enhance performance in cross-sensor cases. (2) $\textit{Low Generalization
Cost}$: it achieves sub-second training and inference, requiring only partial
test inputs and no external data, whereas prior methods often take minutes or
even hours. Experiments on the real-world data from multiple datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art quality and efficiency in
tackling cross-sensor degradation. For example, training and inference of
$512\times512\times8$ image within $\textit{0.2 seconds}$ and
$4000\times4000\times8$ image within $\textit{3 seconds}$ at the fastest
setting on a commonly used RTX 3090 GPU, which is over 100 times faster than
zero-shot methods.

Motivation: 3DGS在多视图重建中表现优异，但在稀疏视图场景中效果不佳，因此需要一种改进方法。

Method: 提出DIP-GS，结合深度图像先验（DIP）和3DGS，采用由粗到细的方式优化重建。

Result: DIP-GS在稀疏视图重建任务中取得SOTA结果，无需预训练模型。

Conclusion: DIP-GS通过DIP先验显著提升了3DGS在稀疏视图场景中的性能。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a leading 3D scene reconstruction method,
obtaining high-quality reconstruction with real-time rendering runtime
performance. The main idea behind 3DGS is to represent the scene as a
collection of 3D gaussians, while learning their parameters to fit the given
views of the scene. While achieving superior performance in the presence of
many views, 3DGS struggles with sparse view reconstruction, where the input
views are sparse and do not fully cover the scene and have low overlaps. In
this paper, we propose DIP-GS, a Deep Image Prior (DIP) 3DGS representation. By
using the DIP prior, which utilizes internal structure and patterns, with
coarse-to-fine manner, DIP-based 3DGS can operate in scenarios where vanilla
3DGS fails, such as sparse view recovery. Note that our approach does not use
any pre-trained models such as generative models and depth estimation, but
rather relies only on the input frames. Among such methods, DIP-GS obtains
state-of-the-art (SOTA) competitive results on various sparse-view
reconstruction tasks, demonstrating its capabilities.

Motivation: 现有MLLMs在RGB视频内容理解上表现优异，但对事件流的解释能力有限或仅适用于短序列。LET-US旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用两阶段优化范式，结合文本引导的跨模态查询、分层聚类和相似性计算，以及大规模事件-文本对齐数据集训练。

Result: 实验表明，LET-US在长持续时间事件流的描述准确性和语义理解上优于现有MLLMs。

Conclusion: LET-US为长事件流与文本的跨模态理解设立了新标准，并公开了数据集、代码和模型。

Abstract: Event cameras output event streams as sparse, asynchronous data with
microsecond-level temporal resolution, enabling visual perception with low
latency and a high dynamic range. While existing Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) have achieved significant success in understanding and analyzing
RGB video content, they either fail to interpret event streams effectively or
remain constrained to very short sequences. In this paper, we introduce LET-US,
a framework for long event-stream--text comprehension that employs an adaptive
compression mechanism to reduce the volume of input events while preserving
critical visual details. LET-US thus establishes a new frontier in cross-modal
inferential understanding over extended event sequences. To bridge the
substantial modality gap between event streams and textual representations, we
adopt a two-stage optimization paradigm that progressively equips our model
with the capacity to interpret event-based scenes. To handle the voluminous
temporal information inherent in long event streams, we leverage text-guided
cross-modal queries for feature reduction, augmented by hierarchical clustering
and similarity computation to distill the most representative event features.
Moreover, we curate and construct a large-scale event-text aligned dataset to
train our model, achieving tighter alignment of event features within the LLM
embedding space. We also develop a comprehensive benchmark covering a diverse
set of tasks -- reasoning, captioning, classification, temporal localization
and moment retrieval. Experimental results demonstrate that LET-US outperforms
prior state-of-the-art MLLMs in both descriptive accuracy and semantic
comprehension on long-duration event streams. All datasets, codes, and models
will be publicly available.

Result: ForensicsSAM在多个基准测试中表现出卓越的对抗鲁棒性，并在伪造检测和定位任务中达到领先水平。

Conclusion: ForensicsSAM为IFDL任务提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a popular strategy for
adapting large vision foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model
(SAM) and LLaVA, to downstream tasks like image forgery detection and
localization (IFDL). However, existing PEFT-based approaches overlook their
vulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we show that highly
transferable adversarial images can be crafted solely via the upstream model,
without accessing the downstream model or training data, significantly
degrading the IFDL performance. To address this, we propose ForensicsSAM, a
unified IFDL framework with built-in adversarial robustness. Our design is
guided by three key ideas: (1) To compensate for the lack of forgery-relevant
knowledge in the frozen image encoder, we inject forgery experts into each
transformer block to enhance its ability to capture forgery artifacts. These
forgery experts are always activated and shared across any input images. (2) To
detect adversarial images, we design an light-weight adversary detector that
learns to capture structured, task-specific artifact in RGB domain, enabling
reliable discrimination across various attack methods. (3) To resist
adversarial attacks, we inject adversary experts into the global attention
layers and MLP modules to progressively correct feature shifts induced by
adversarial noise. These adversary experts are adaptively activated by the
adversary detector, thereby avoiding unnecessary interference with clean
images. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
ForensicsSAM achieves superior resistance to various adversarial attack
methods, while also delivering state-of-the-art performance in image-level
forgery detection and pixel-level forgery localization. The resource is

Abstract: In this paper, we propose \textbf{CharacterShot}, a controllable and
consistent 4D character animation framework that enables any individual
designer to create dynamic 3D characters (i.e., 4D character animation) from a
single reference character image and a 2D pose sequence. We begin by
pretraining a powerful 2D character animation model based on a cutting-edge
DiT-based image-to-video model, which allows for any 2D pose sequnce as
controllable signal. We then lift the animation model from 2D to 3D through
introducing dual-attention module together with camera prior to generate
multi-view videos with spatial-temporal and spatial-view consistency. Finally,
we employ a novel neighbor-constrained 4D gaussian splatting optimization on
these multi-view videos, resulting in continuous and stable 4D character
representations. Moreover, to improve character-centric performance, we
construct a large-scale dataset Character4D, containing 13,115 unique
characters with diverse appearances and motions, rendered from multiple
viewpoints. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark,
CharacterBench, demonstrate that our approach outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods. Code, models, and datasets will be publicly available

Result: CLUE在泛化性能和鲁棒性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CLUE为伪造图像定位提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing accessibility of image editing tools and generative AI has led
to a proliferation of visually convincing forgeries, compromising the
authenticity of digital media. In this paper, in addition to leveraging
distortions from conventional forgeries, we repurpose the mechanism of a
state-of-the-art (SOTA) text-to-image synthesis model by exploiting its
internal generative process, turning it into a high-fidelity forgery
localization tool. To this end, we propose CLUE (Capture Latent Uncovered
Evidence), a framework that employs Low- Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to
parameter-efficiently reconfigure Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3) as a forensic
feature extractor. Our approach begins with the strategic use of SD3's
Rectified Flow (RF) mechanism to inject noise at varying intensities into the
latent representation, thereby steering the LoRAtuned denoising process to
amplify subtle statistical inconsistencies indicative of a forgery. To
complement the latent analysis with high-level semantic context and precise
spatial details, our method incorporates contextual features from the image
encoder of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), which is parameter-efficiently
adapted to better trace the boundaries of forged regions. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate CLUE's SOTA generalization performance, significantly outperforming
prior methods. Furthermore, CLUE shows superior robustness against common
post-processing attacks and Online Social Networks (OSNs). Code is publicly

Abstract: Fine-grained multimodal capability in Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) has emerged as a critical research direction, particularly for tackling
the visual grounding (VG) problem. Despite the strong performance achieved by
existing approaches, they often employ disparate design choices when
fine-tuning MLLMs for VG, lacking systematic verification to support these
designs. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive study of
various design choices that impact the VG performance of MLLMs. We conduct our
analysis using LLaVA-1.5, which has been widely adopted in prior empirical
studies of MLLMs. While more recent models exist, we follow this convention to
ensure our findings remain broadly applicable and extendable to other
architectures. We cover two key aspects: (1) exploring different visual
grounding paradigms in MLLMs, identifying the most effective design, and
providing our insights; and (2) conducting ablation studies on the design of
grounding data to optimize MLLMs' fine-tuning for the VG task. Finally, our
findings contribute to a stronger MLLM for VG, achieving improvements of +5.6%
/ +6.9% / +7.0% on RefCOCO/+/g over the LLaVA-1.5.

Result: CDA减少性别差距6%，DAUDoS减少3%且仅需三分之一数据；两种方法均提升性别识别准确率3%。

Conclusion: CLIP的视觉编码器偏见更显著，PaliGemma2的文本编码器偏见更显著，研究为未来多模态系统的针对性去偏提供了方向。

Abstract: Vision Language Models achieve impressive multi-modal performance but often
inherit gender biases from their training data. This bias might be coming from
both the vision and text modalities. In this work, we dissect the contributions
of vision and text backbones to these biases by applying targeted debiasing
using Counterfactual Data Augmentation and Task Vector methods. Inspired by
data-efficient approaches in hate-speech classification, we introduce a novel
metric, Degree of Stereotypicality and a corresponding debiasing method, Data
Augmentation Using Degree of Stereotypicality - DAUDoS, to reduce bias with
minimal computational cost. We curate a gender annotated dataset and evaluate
all methods on VisoGender benchmark to quantify improvements and identify
dominant source of bias. Our results show that CDA reduces the gender gap by 6%
and DAUDoS by 3% but using only one-third of the data. Both methods also
improve the model's ability to correctly identify gender in images by 3%, with
DAUDoS achieving this improvement using only almost one-third of training data.
From our experiment's, we observed that CLIP's vision encoder is more biased
whereas PaliGemma2's text encoder is more biased. By identifying whether bias
stems more from vision or text encoders, our work enables more targeted and
effective bias mitigation strategies in future multi-modal systems.

Result: 在Real-IAD基准测试中表现出优异的异常检测和定位性能，且具有抗污染能力。

Conclusion: 该框架兼容多种无监督模型，为实际场景中不完美的训练数据提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of fully unsupervised image anomaly
detection (FUIAD), where training data may contain unlabeled anomalies.
Conventional methods assume anomaly-free training data, but real-world
contamination leads models to absorb anomalies as normal, degrading detection
performance. To mitigate this, we propose a two-stage framework that
systematically exploits inherent learning bias in models. The learning bias
stems from: (1) the statistical dominance of normal samples, driving models to
prioritize learning stable normal patterns over sparse anomalies, and (2)
feature-space divergence, where normal data exhibit high intra-class
consistency while anomalies display high diversity, leading to unstable model
responses. Leveraging the learning bias, stage 1 partitions the training set
into subsets, trains sub-models, and aggregates cross-model anomaly scores to
filter a purified dataset. Stage 2 trains the final detector on this dataset.
Experiments on the Real-IAD benchmark demonstrate superior anomaly detection
and localization performance under different noise conditions. Ablation studies
further validate the framework's contamination resilience, emphasizing the
critical role of learning bias exploitation. The model-agnostic design ensures
compatibility with diverse unsupervised backbones, offering a practical
solution for real-world scenarios with imperfect training data. Code is

Motivation: 现有音频-视觉基准测试忽视推理过程，无法区分真正理解与错误推理或幻觉导致的正确答案。

Method: AURA包含六个认知领域的问题，设计为无法通过单一模态回答，并引入AuraScore评估推理的忠实性。

Conclusion: AURA揭示了模型推理能力的不足，为更稳健的多模态评估提供了工具。

Abstract: Current audio-visual (AV) benchmarks focus on final answer accuracy,
overlooking the underlying reasoning process. This makes it difficult to
distinguish genuine comprehension from correct answers derived through flawed
reasoning or hallucinations. To address this, we introduce AURA (Audio-visual
Understanding and Reasoning Assessment), a benchmark for evaluating the
cross-modal reasoning capabilities of Audio-Visual Large Language Models
(AV-LLMs) and Omni-modal Language Models (OLMs). AURA includes questions across
six challenging cognitive domains, such as causality, timbre and pitch, tempo
and AV synchronization, unanswerability, implicit distractions, and skill
profiling, explicitly designed to be unanswerable from a single modality. This
forces models to construct a valid logical path grounded in both audio and
video, setting AURA apart from AV datasets that allow uni-modal shortcuts. To
assess reasoning traces, we propose a novel metric, AuraScore, which addresses
the lack of robust tools for evaluating reasoning fidelity. It decomposes
reasoning into two aspects: (i) Factual Consistency - whether reasoning is
grounded in perceptual evidence, and (ii) Core Inference - the logical validity
of each reasoning step. Evaluations of SOTA models on AURA reveal a critical
reasoning gap: although models achieve high accuracy (up to 92% on some tasks),
their Factual Consistency and Core Inference scores fall below 45%. This
discrepancy highlights that models often arrive at correct answers through
flawed logic, underscoring the need for our benchmark and paving the way for
more robust multimodal evaluation.

Abstract: In this paper, I present a comprehensive study comparing Photogrammetry and
Gaussian Splatting techniques for 3D model reconstruction and view synthesis. I
created a dataset of images from a real-world scene and constructed 3D models
using both methods. To evaluate the performance, I compared the models using
structural similarity index (SSIM), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), learned
perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS), and lp/mm resolution based on the
USAF resolution chart. A significant contribution of this work is the
development of a modified Gaussian Splatting repository, which I forked and
enhanced to enable rendering images from novel camera poses generated in the
Blender environment. This innovation allows for the synthesis of high-quality
novel views, showcasing the flexibility and potential of Gaussian Splatting. My
investigation extends to an augmented dataset that includes both original
ground images and novel views synthesized via Gaussian Splatting. This
augmented dataset was employed to generate a new photogrammetry model, which
was then compared against the original photogrammetry model created using only
the original images. The results demonstrate the efficacy of using Gaussian
Splatting to generate novel high-quality views and its potential to improve
photogrammetry-based 3D reconstructions. The comparative analysis highlights
the strengths and limitations of both approaches, providing valuable
information for applications in extended reality (XR), photogrammetry, and
autonomous vehicle simulations. Code is available at

TL;DR: VisR-Bench是一个多语言基准测试，用于长文档中的问题驱动多模态检索，覆盖16种语言和3种问题类型，评估了多种检索模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注英文文档检索或单页图像的多语言问答，缺乏对多语言长文档多模态检索的评估，VisR-Bench填补了这一空白。

Method: VisR-Bench包含超过35K高质量QA对和1.2K文档，支持细粒度多模态检索评估，涵盖16种语言和3种问题类型（图表、文本和表格）。

Result: 评估显示，MLLMs显著优于基于文本和多模态编码器的模型，但在结构化表格和低资源语言上仍存在挑战。

Conclusion: VisR-Bench为多语言视觉检索提供了重要基准，揭示了当前模型的局限性，尤其是对结构化内容和低资源语言的处理能力。

Abstract: Most organizational data in this world are stored as documents, and visual
retrieval plays a crucial role in unlocking the collective intelligence from
all these documents. However, existing benchmarks focus on English-only
document retrieval or only consider multilingual question-answering on a
single-page image. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisR-Bench, a multilingual
benchmark designed for question-driven multimodal retrieval in long documents.
Our benchmark comprises over 35K high-quality QA pairs across 1.2K documents,
enabling fine-grained evaluation of multimodal retrieval. VisR-Bench spans
sixteen languages with three question types (figures, text, and tables),
offering diverse linguistic and question coverage. Unlike prior datasets, we
include queries without explicit answers, preventing models from relying on
superficial keyword matching. We evaluate various retrieval models, including
text-based methods, multimodal encoders, and MLLMs, providing insights into
their strengths and limitations. Our results show that while MLLMs
significantly outperform text-based and multimodal encoder models, they still
struggle with structured tables and low-resource languages, highlighting key
challenges in multilingual visual retrieval.

Method: 结合通用自监督视觉模型与植物分类学层次推理，利用多国多年数据集训练，并在跨设备和跨地域数据上测试模型鲁棒性。

Result: 模型显著提升了物种识别（F1-score: 0.52到0.85）和损害分类（F1-score: 0.28到0.44）的性能，在域偏移（无人机图像）下仍保持较强表现。

Conclusion: 模型具有鲁棒性和实际应用价值，已部署于BASF的表型分析流程中，支持大规模自动化作物和杂草监测。

Abstract: Field trials are vital in herbicide research and development to assess
effects on crops and weeds under varied conditions. Traditionally, evaluations
rely on manual visual assessments, which are time-consuming, labor-intensive,
and subjective. Automating species and damage identification is challenging due
to subtle visual differences, but it can greatly enhance efficiency and
consistency.
  We present an improved segmentation model combining a general-purpose
self-supervised visual model with hierarchical inference based on botanical
taxonomy. Trained on a multi-year dataset (2018-2020) from Germany and Spain
using digital and mobile cameras, the model was tested on digital camera data
(year 2023) and drone imagery from the United States, Germany, and Spain (year
2024) to evaluate robustness under domain shift. This cross-device evaluation
marks a key step in assessing generalization across platforms of the model.
  Our model significantly improved species identification (F1-score: 0.52 to
0.85, R-squared: 0.75 to 0.98) and damage classification (F1-score: 0.28 to
0.44, R-squared: 0.71 to 0.87) over prior methods. Under domain shift (drone
images), it maintained strong performance with moderate degradation (species:
F1-score 0.60, R-squared 0.80; damage: F1-score 0.41, R-squared 0.62), where
earlier models failed.
  These results confirm the model's robustness and real-world applicability. It
is now deployed in BASF's phenotyping pipeline, enabling large-scale, automated
crop and weed monitoring across diverse geographies.

Result: 提出了一种适用于MM-DiT变体的鲁棒编辑方法，支持多粒度编辑。

Conclusion: 研究填补了U-Net与新兴架构间的技术鸿沟，为MM-DiT行为模式提供了新见解。

Abstract: Transformer-based diffusion models have recently superseded traditional U-Net
architectures, with multimodal diffusion transformers (MM-DiT) emerging as the
dominant approach in state-of-the-art models like Stable Diffusion 3 and
Flux.1. Previous approaches have relied on unidirectional cross-attention
mechanisms, with information flowing from text embeddings to image latents. In
contrast, MMDiT introduces a unified attention mechanism that concatenates
input projections from both modalities and performs a single full attention
operation, allowing bidirectional information flow between text and image
branches. This architectural shift presents significant challenges for existing
editing techniques. In this paper, we systematically analyze MM-DiT's attention
mechanism by decomposing attention matrices into four distinct blocks,
revealing their inherent characteristics. Through these analyses, we propose a
robust, prompt-based image editing method for MM-DiT that supports global to
local edits across various MM-DiT variants, including few-step models. We
believe our findings bridge the gap between existing U-Net-based methods and
emerging architectures, offering deeper insights into MMDiT's behavioral
patterns.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像诊断中，噪声标签和类别模糊实例会干扰top-rank学习的目标，影响诊断准确性。

Method: 提出一种新方法，通过集成拒绝模块与top-rank损失共同优化，识别并减少异常值的影响。拒绝模块作为附加分支，通过拒绝函数评估实例的偏差。

Result: 在医学数据集上的实验验证表明，该方法能有效检测和减少异常值，提升诊断的可靠性和准确性。

Conclusion: 结合拒绝模块的top-rank学习方法能显著提升医学图像诊断的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: In medical image processing, accurate diagnosis is of paramount importance.
Leveraging machine learning techniques, particularly top-rank learning, shows
significant promise by focusing on the most crucial instances. However,
challenges arise from noisy labels and class-ambiguous instances, which can
severely hinder the top-rank objective, as they may be erroneously placed among
the top-ranked instances. To address these, we propose a novel approach that
enhances toprank learning by integrating a rejection module. Cooptimized with
the top-rank loss, this module identifies and mitigates the impact of outliers
that hinder training effectiveness. The rejection module functions as an
additional branch, assessing instances based on a rejection function that
measures their deviation from the norm. Through experimental validation on a
medical dataset, our methodology demonstrates its efficacy in detecting and
mitigating outliers, improving the reliability and accuracy of medical image
diagnoses.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对中文文本图像超分辨率（SR）的新框架，通过结构先验和StyleGAN模型结合，实现了对低分辨率中文字符的精确恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注英文文本，对更复杂的中文脚本关注不足。本文旨在解决低分辨率中文字符恢复的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种结构先验，结合StyleGAN模型，通过代码本机制限制生成空间，生成高分辨率结构先验。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能准确恢复模糊字符的清晰笔画，适用于不规则布局的真实低分辨率中文文本。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结构先验和StyleGAN的协作，显著提升了中文文本图像的超分辨率效果。

Abstract: Faithful text image super-resolution (SR) is challenging because each
character has a unique structure and usually exhibits diverse font styles and
layouts. While existing methods primarily focus on English text, less attention
has been paid to more complex scripts like Chinese. In this paper, we introduce
a high-quality text image SR framework designed to restore the precise strokes
of low-resolution (LR) Chinese characters. Unlike methods that rely on
character recognition priors to regularize the SR task, we propose a novel
structure prior that offers structure-level guidance to enhance visual quality.
Our framework incorporates this structure prior within a StyleGAN model,
leveraging its generative capabilities for restoration. To maintain the
integrity of character structures while accommodating various font styles and
layouts, we implement a codebook-based mechanism that restricts the generative
space of StyleGAN. Each code in the codebook represents the structure of a
specific character, while the vector $w$ in StyleGAN controls the character's
style, including typeface, orientation, and location. Through the collaborative
interaction between the codebook and style, we generate a high-resolution
structure prior that aligns with LR characters both spatially and structurally.
Experiments demonstrate that this structure prior provides robust,
character-specific guidance, enabling the accurate restoration of clear strokes
in degraded characters, even for real-world LR Chinese text with irregular
layouts. Our code and pre-trained models will be available at

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了医学图像去标识化的重要性，并详细描述了在MICCAI 2024的MIDI-B挑战中应用的方法及其结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像去标识化对于保护患者隐私至关重要，同时需确保数据在研究、诊断和治疗中的实用性。

Method: 采用了像素掩码、日期偏移、日期哈希、文本识别、文本替换和文本移除等方法。

Result: 算法在挑战中正确执行了99.92%的操作，排名第二。

Conclusion: 论文总结了当前方法的局限性，并提出了未来改进的方向。

Abstract: Image de-identification is essential for the public sharing of medical
images, particularly in the widely used Digital Imaging and Communications in
Medicine (DICOM) format as required by various regulations and standards,
including Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy
rules, the DICOM PS3.15 standard, and best practices recommended by the Cancer
Imaging Archive (TCIA). The Medical Image De-Identification Benchmark (MIDI-B)
Challenge at the 27th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and
Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI 2024) was organized to evaluate
rule-based DICOM image de-identification algorithms with a large dataset of
clinical DICOM images. In this report, we explore the critical challenges of
de-identifying DICOM images, emphasize the importance of removing personally
identifiable information (PII) to protect patient privacy while ensuring the
continued utility of medical data for research, diagnostics, and treatment, and
provide a comprehensive overview of the standards and regulations that govern
this process. Additionally, we detail the de-identification methods we applied
- such as pixel masking, date shifting, date hashing, text recognition, text
replacement, and text removal - to process datasets during the test phase in
strict compliance with these standards. According to the final leaderboard of
the MIDI-B challenge, the latest version of our solution algorithm correctly
executed 99.92% of the required actions and ranked 2nd out of 10 teams that
completed the challenge (from a total of 22 registered teams). Finally, we
conducted a thorough analysis of the resulting statistics and discussed the
limitations of current approaches and potential avenues for future improvement.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖多医院数据，但数据收集困难。因此，本文提出利用医院内域偏移，通过聚类和对比学习解决这一问题。

Method: 聚类非肿瘤区域的WSI级特征作为域，采用两阶段对比学习（WSI级和patch级）减少特征差异。

Result: 提出的方法有效减少了域偏移，提高了模型的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过利用医院内域偏移和对比学习，本文方法在病理图像域泛化中表现出色。

Abstract: In this paper, we address domain shifts in pathological images by focusing on
shifts within whole slide images~(WSIs), such as patient characteristics and
tissue thickness, rather than shifts between hospitals. Traditional approaches
rely on multi-hospital data, but data collection challenges often make this
impractical. Therefore, the proposed domain generalization method captures and
leverages intra-hospital domain shifts by clustering WSI-level features from
non-tumor regions and treating these clusters as domains. To mitigate domain
shift, we apply contrastive learning to reduce feature gaps between WSI pairs
from different clusters. The proposed method introduces a two-stage contrastive
learning approach WSI-level and patch-level contrastive learning to minimize
these gaps effectively.

Result: 实验表明，CoT-Pose能从抽象文本输入生成语义对齐的合理姿态。

Conclusion: 该工作强调了高层次理解在姿态生成中的重要性，为推理增强的姿态生成方法开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have led to significant progress in image and
text generation tasks. However, the field of 3D human pose generation still
faces critical limitations. Most existing text-to-pose models rely heavily on
detailed (low-level) prompts that explicitly describe joint configurations. In
contrast, humans tend to communicate actions and intentions using abstract
(high-level) language. This mismatch results in a practical challenge for
deploying pose generation systems in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap,
we introduce a novel framework that incorporates CoT reasoning into the pose
generation process, enabling the interpretation of abstract prompts into
accurate 3D human poses. We further propose a data synthesis pipeline that
automatically generates triplets of abstract prompts, detailed prompts, and
corresponding 3D poses for training process. Experimental results demonstrate
that our reasoning-enhanced model, CoT-Pose, can effectively generate plausible
and semantically aligned poses from abstract textual inputs. This work
highlights the importance of high-level understanding in pose generation and
opens new directions for reasoning-enhanced approach for human pose generation.

Abstract: Automated soccer commentary generation has evolved from template-based
systems to advanced neural architectures, aiming to produce real-time
descriptions of sports events. While frameworks like SoccerNet-Caption laid
foundational work, their inability to achieve fine-grained alignment between
video content and commentary remains a significant challenge. Recent efforts
such as MatchTime, with its MatchVoice model, address this issue through coarse
and fine-grained alignment techniques, achieving improved temporal
synchronization. In this paper, we extend MatchVoice to commentary generation
for soccer highlights using the GOAL dataset, which emphasizes short clips over
entire games. We conduct extensive experiments to reproduce the original
MatchTime results and evaluate our setup, highlighting the impact of different
training configurations and hardware limitations. Furthermore, we explore the
effect of varying window sizes on zero-shot performance. While MatchVoice
exhibits promising generalization capabilities, our findings suggest the need
for integrating techniques from broader video-language domains to further
enhance performance. Our code is available at

Result: 在NuScenes数据集上的实验表明，该方法提升了3D目标检测性能，NDS提高了3.89%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了特征表示质量和整体模型性能，验证了其可行性。

Abstract: End-to-end models are emerging as the mainstream in autonomous driving
perception and planning. However, the lack of explicit supervision signals for
intermediate functional modules leads to opaque operational mechanisms and
limited interpretability, making it challenging for traditional methods to
independently evaluate and train these modules. Pioneering in the issue, this
study builds upon the feature map-truth representation similarity-based
evaluation framework and proposes an independent evaluation method based on
Feature Map Convergence Score (FMCS). A Dual-Granularity Dynamic Weighted
Scoring System (DG-DWSS) is constructed, formulating a unified quantitative
metric - Feature Map Quality Score - to enable comprehensive evaluation of the
quality of feature maps generated by functional modules. A CLIP-based Feature
Map Quality Evaluation Network (CLIP-FMQE-Net) is further developed, combining
feature-truth encoders and quality score prediction heads to enable real-time
quality analysis of feature maps generated by functional modules. Experimental
results on the NuScenes dataset demonstrate that integrating our evaluation
module into the training improves 3D object detection performance, achieving a
3.89 percent gain in NDS. These results verify the effectiveness of our method
in enhancing feature representation quality and overall model performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在分布偏移下性能下降，且缺乏标注数据时难以适应。现有缓存方法因不可靠的置信度指标和刚性决策边界而表现不佳。

Method: 提出ACE框架，通过动态、类别特定的阈值选择高置信度或低熵图像嵌入，并利用指数移动平均和探索增强更新优化缓存。

Result: 在15个基准数据集上，ACE表现出色，优于现有测试时适应方法，在分布偏移场景中具有更强的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: ACE通过自适应缓存和动态决策边界，显著提升了视觉语言模型在分布偏移下的性能，为测试时适应提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable zero-shot generalization but
suffer performance degradation under distribution shifts in downstream tasks,
particularly in the absence of labeled data. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA)
addresses this challenge by enabling online optimization of VLMs during
inference, eliminating the need for annotated data. Cache-based TTA methods
exploit historical knowledge by maintaining a dynamic memory cache of
low-entropy or high-confidence samples, promoting efficient adaptation to
out-of-distribution data. Nevertheless, these methods face two critical
challenges: (1) unreliable confidence metrics under significant distribution
shifts, resulting in error accumulation within the cache and degraded
adaptation performance; and (2) rigid decision boundaries that fail to
accommodate substantial distributional variations, leading to suboptimal
predictions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Adaptive Cache
Enhancement (ACE) framework, which constructs a robust cache by selectively
storing high-confidence or low-entropy image embeddings per class, guided by
dynamic, class-specific thresholds initialized from zero-shot statistics and
iteratively refined using an exponential moving average and
exploration-augmented updates. This approach enables adaptive, class-wise
decision boundaries, ensuring robust and accurate predictions across diverse
visual distributions. Extensive experiments on 15 diverse benchmark datasets
demonstrate that ACE achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior
robustness and generalization compared to existing TTA methods in challenging
out-of-distribution scenarios.

Motivation: 探索LayerNorm在数据稀缺和域转移下的微调动态，填补研究空白。

Method: 提出FSR量化目标域代表性，设计标量λ的重新缩放机制和循环框架优化LayerNorm微调。

Result: 实验验证了框架的有效性，发现OOD任务FSR较低、λ较高，病理数据更接近ID设置。

Conclusion: 揭示了LayerNorm在迁移学习中的动态特性，提供了实用的微调策略。

Abstract: LayerNorm is pivotal in Vision Transformers (ViTs), yet its fine-tuning
dynamics under data scarcity and domain shifts remain underexplored. This paper
shows that shifts in LayerNorm parameters after fine-tuning (LayerNorm shifts)
are indicative of the transitions between source and target domains; its
efficacy is contingent upon the degree to which the target training samples
accurately represent the target domain, as quantified by our proposed
Fine-tuning Shift Ratio ($FSR$). Building on this, we propose a simple yet
effective rescaling mechanism using a scalar $\lambda$ that is negatively
correlated to $FSR$ to align learned LayerNorm shifts with those ideal shifts
achieved under fully representative data, combined with a cyclic framework that
further enhances the LayerNorm fine-tuning. Extensive experiments across
natural and pathological images, in both in-distribution (ID) and
out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, and various target training sample regimes
validate our framework. Notably, OOD tasks tend to yield lower $FSR$ and higher
$\lambda$ in comparison to ID cases, especially with scarce data, indicating
under-represented target training samples. Moreover, ViTFs fine-tuned on
pathological data behave more like ID settings, favoring conservative LayerNorm
updates. Our findings illuminate the underexplored dynamics of LayerNorm in
transfer learning and provide practical strategies for LayerNorm fine-tuning.

Motivation: 现有SOD模型依赖重型骨干网络，计算成本高，限制了在边缘设备等实际场景中的应用。

Result: 在轻量级图像和视频SOD模型中达到最新性能。

Conclusion: GAPNet通过高效设计和监督策略，显著提升了轻量级SOD模型的性能。

Abstract: Recent salient object detection (SOD) models predominantly rely on
heavyweight backbones, incurring substantial computational cost and hindering
their practical application in various real-world settings, particularly on
edge devices. This paper presents GAPNet, a lightweight network built on the
granularity-aware paradigm for both image and video SOD. We assign saliency
maps of different granularities to supervise the multi-scale decoder
side-outputs: coarse object locations for high-level outputs and fine-grained
object boundaries for low-level outputs. Specifically, our decoder is built
with granularity-aware connections which fuse high-level features of low
granularity and low-level features of high granularity, respectively. To
support these connections, we design granular pyramid convolution (GPC) and
cross-scale attention (CSA) modules for efficient fusion of low-scale and
high-scale features, respectively. On top of the encoder, a self-attention
module is built to learn global information, enabling accurate object
localization with negligible computational cost. Unlike traditional U-Net-based
approaches, our proposed method optimizes feature utilization and semantic
interpretation while applying appropriate supervision at each processing stage.
Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves a new
state-of-the-art performance among lightweight image and video SOD models. Code

Abstract: Voice disorders significantly affect communication and quality of life,
requiring an early and accurate diagnosis. Traditional methods like
laryngoscopy are invasive, subjective, and often inaccessible. This research
proposes a noninvasive, machine learning-based framework for detecting voice
pathologies using phonation data.
  Phonation data from the Saarbr\"ucken Voice Database are analyzed using
acoustic features such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), chroma
features, and Mel spectrograms. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), including
LSTM and attention mechanisms, classify samples into normal and pathological
categories. Data augmentation techniques, including pitch shifting and Gaussian
noise addition, enhance model generalizability, while preprocessing ensures
signal quality. Scale-based features, such as H\"older and Hurst exponents,
further capture signal irregularities and long-term dependencies.
  The proposed framework offers a noninvasive, automated diagnostic tool for
early detection of voice pathologies, supporting AI-driven healthcare, and
improving patient outcomes.

Motivation: 深度伪造技术对数字完整性构成严重威胁，现有检测系统缺乏透明度和可解释性，限制了其在实际决策中的应用。

Method: DF-P2E框架包含三个模块：基于Grad-CAM的深度伪造分类器、视觉描述模块和叙述优化模块，结合LLM生成用户敏感的解释。

Result: 在DF40数据集上，系统实现了竞争性检测性能，并提供与Grad-CAM激活一致的高质量解释。

Conclusion: DF-P2E通过统一预测和解释，推动了可信赖和透明AI系统的发展。

Abstract: The proliferation of deepfake technologies poses urgent challenges and
serious risks to digital integrity, particularly within critical sectors such
as forensics, journalism, and the legal system. While existing detection
systems have made significant progress in classification accuracy, they
typically function as black-box models, offering limited transparency and
minimal support for human reasoning. This lack of interpretability hinders
their usability in real-world decision-making contexts, especially for
non-expert users. In this paper, we present DF-P2E (Deepfake: Prediction to
Explanation), a novel multimodal framework that integrates visual, semantic,
and narrative layers of explanation to make deepfake detection interpretable
and accessible. The framework consists of three modular components: (1) a
deepfake classifier with Grad-CAM-based saliency visualisation, (2) a visual
captioning module that generates natural language summaries of manipulated
regions, and (3) a narrative refinement module that uses a fine-tuned Large
Language Model (LLM) to produce context-aware, user-sensitive explanations. We
instantiate and evaluate the framework on the DF40 benchmark, the most diverse
deepfake dataset to date. Experiments demonstrate that our system achieves
competitive detection performance while providing high-quality explanations
aligned with Grad-CAM activations. By unifying prediction and explanation in a
coherent, human-aligned pipeline, this work offers a scalable approach to
interpretable deepfake detection, advancing the broader vision of trustworthy
and transparent AI systems in adversarial media environments.

Abstract: Over-the-shoulder dialogue videos are essential in films, short dramas, and

underexplored in video generation research. The main challenges include
maintaining character consistency across different shots, creating a sense of
spatial continuity, and generating long, multi-turn dialogues within limited
computational budgets. Here, we present ShoulderShot, a framework that combines
dual-shot generation with looping video, enabling extended dialogues while
preserving character consistency. Our results demonstrate capabilities that
surpass existing methods in terms of shot-reverse-shot layout, spatial
continuity, and flexibility in dialogue length, thereby opening up new
possibilities for practical dialogue video generation. Videos and comparisons

Abstract: In this paper, we present LaVieID, a novel \underline{l}ocal
\underline{a}utoregressive \underline{vi}d\underline{e}o diffusion framework
designed to tackle the challenging \underline{id}entity-preserving
text-to-video task. The key idea of LaVieID is to mitigate the loss of identity
information inherent in the stochastic global generation process of diffusion
transformers (DiTs) from both spatial and temporal perspectives. Specifically,
unlike the global and unstructured modeling of facial latent states in existing
DiTs, LaVieID introduces a local router to explicitly represent latent states
by weighted combinations of fine-grained local facial structures. This
alleviates undesirable feature interference and encourages DiTs to capture
distinctive facial characteristics. Furthermore, a temporal autoregressive
module is integrated into LaVieID to refine denoised latent tokens before video
decoding. This module divides latent tokens temporally into chunks, exploiting
their long-range temporal dependencies to predict biases for rectifying tokens,
thereby significantly enhancing inter-frame identity consistency. Consequently,
LaVieID can generate high-fidelity personalized videos and achieve
state-of-the-art performance. Our code and models are available at

Result: 模型编辑性能优异，数据集优于现有开源数据集。

Conclusion: X2Edit数据集和训练方法为图像编辑任务提供了高质量解决方案。

Abstract: Existing open-source datasets for arbitrary-instruction image editing remain
suboptimal, while a plug-and-play editing module compatible with
community-prevalent generative models is notably absent. In this paper, we
first introduce the X2Edit Dataset, a comprehensive dataset covering 14 diverse
editing tasks, including subject-driven generation. We utilize the
industry-leading unified image generation models and expert models to construct
the data. Meanwhile, we design reasonable editing instructions with the VLM and
implement various scoring mechanisms to filter the data. As a result, we
construct 3.7 million high-quality data with balanced categories. Second, to
better integrate seamlessly with community image generation models, we design
task-aware MoE-LoRA training based on FLUX.1, with only 8\% of the parameters
of the full model. To further improve the final performance, we utilize the
internal representations of the diffusion model and define positive/negative
samples based on image editing types to introduce contrastive learning.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the model's editing performance is
competitive among many excellent models. Additionally, the constructed dataset
exhibits substantial advantages over existing open-source datasets. The
open-source code, checkpoints, and datasets for X2Edit can be found at the

Motivation: 小型探测器导致截断FOV，影响迭代重建图像质量，需解决截断伪影问题。

Method: 第一阶段用INR生成先验图像，覆盖扩展区域；第二阶段用校正后的投影数据进行常规迭代重建。

Result: 数值结果表明，该方法有效抑制截断伪影，提升CBCT图像质量。

Conclusion: 两阶段方法通过INR和迭代重建结合，显著改善了截断FOV下的图像重建质量。

Abstract: In dental cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), compact and cost-effective
system designs often use small detectors, resulting in a truncated field of
view (FOV) that does not fully encompass the patient's head. In iterative
reconstruction approaches, the discrepancy between the actual projection and
the forward projection within the truncated FOV accumulates over iterations,
leading to significant degradation in the reconstructed image quality. In this
study, we propose a two-stage approach to mitigate truncation artifacts in
dental CBCT. In the first stage, we employ Implicit Neural Representation
(INR), leveraging its superior representation power, to generate a prior image
over an extended region so that its forward projection fully covers the
patient's head. To reduce computational and memory burdens, INR reconstruction
is performed with a coarse voxel size. The forward projection of this prior
image is then used to estimate the discrepancy due to truncated FOV in the
measured projection data. In the second stage, the discrepancy-corrected
projection data is utilized in a conventional iterative reconstruction process
within the truncated region. Our numerical results demonstrate that the
proposed two-grid approach effectively suppresses truncation artifacts, leading
to improved CBCT image quality.

Conclusion: SOFA首次整合消融效果模拟、复发预测和参数优化，为个性化房颤消融提供新工具。

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a prevalent cardiac arrhythmia often treated with
catheter ablation procedures, but procedural outcomes are highly variable.
Evaluating and improving ablation efficacy is challenging due to the complex
interaction between patient-specific tissue and procedural factors. This paper
asks two questions: Can AF recurrence be predicted by simulating the effects of
procedural parameters? How should we ablate to reduce AF recurrence? We propose
SOFA (Simulating and Optimizing Atrial Fibrillation Ablation), a novel
deep-learning framework that addresses these questions. SOFA first simulates
the outcome of an ablation strategy by generating a post-ablation image
depicting scar formation, conditioned on a patient's pre-ablation LGE-MRI and
the specific procedural parameters used (e.g., ablation locations, duration,
temperature, power, and force). During this simulation, it predicts AF
recurrence risk. Critically, SOFA then introduces an optimization scheme that
refines these procedural parameters to minimize the predicted risk. Our method
leverages a multi-modal, multi-view generator that processes 2.5D
representations of the atrium. Quantitative evaluations show that SOFA
accurately synthesizes post-ablation images and that our optimization scheme
leads to a 22.18\% reduction in the model-predicted recurrence risk. To the
best of our knowledge, SOFA is the first framework to integrate the simulation
of procedural effects, recurrence prediction, and parameter optimization,
offering a novel tool for personalizing AF ablation.

Motivation: 现有目标检测模型未能充分利用静态环境中的空间先验，导致检测不一致或错误。

Method: 使用图神经网络（GNN）建模物体空间关系，修正异常检测结果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法使mAP@50提升高达4%。

Conclusion: 利用环境空间结构可显著提升目标检测系统的可靠性。

Abstract: In many real-world applications involving static environments, the spatial
layout of objects remains consistent across instances. However,
state-of-the-art object detection models often fail to leverage this spatial
prior, resulting in inconsistent predictions, missed detections, or
misclassifications, particularly in cluttered or occluded scenes. In this work,
we propose a graph-based post-processing pipeline that explicitly models the
spatial relationships between objects to correct detection anomalies in
egocentric frames. Using a graph neural network (GNN) trained on manually
annotated data, our model identifies invalid object class labels and predicts
corrected class labels based on their neighbourhood context. We evaluate our
approach both as a standalone anomaly detection and correction framework and as
a post-processing module for standard object detectors such as YOLOv7 and
RT-DETR. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating this spatial reasoning
significantly improves detection performance, with mAP@50 gains of up to 4%.
This method highlights the potential of leveraging the environment's spatial
structure to improve reliability in object detection systems.

Conclusion: TER通过置信度模块提升了模型的可靠性和鲁棒性，实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Existing emotion recognition methods mainly focus on enhancing performance by
employing complex deep models, typically resulting in significantly higher
model complexity. Although effective, it is also crucial to ensure the
reliability of the final decision, especially for noisy, corrupted and
out-of-distribution data. To this end, we propose a novel emotion recognition
method called trusted emotion recognition (TER), which utilizes uncertainty
estimation to calculate the confidence value of predictions. TER combines the
results from multiple modalities based on their confidence values to output the
trusted predictions. We also provide a new evaluation criterion to assess the
reliability of predictions. Specifically, we incorporate trusted precision and
trusted recall to determine the trusted threshold and formulate the trusted
Acc. and trusted F1 score to evaluate the model's trusted performance. The
proposed framework combines the confidence module that accordingly endows the
model with reliability and robustness against possible noise or corruption. The
extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed
model. The TER achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Music-video,
achieving 82.40% Acc. In terms of trusted performance, TER outperforms other
methods on the IEMOCAP and Music-video, achieving trusted F1 scores of 0.7511

Conclusion: 显式模仿人类动作在数据稀缺时更有效，AR-VRM方法具有优越性。

Abstract: Visual Robot Manipulation (VRM) aims to enable a robot to follow natural
language instructions based on robot states and visual observations, and
therefore requires costly multi-modal data. To compensate for the deficiency of
robot data, existing approaches have employed vision-language pretraining with
large-scale data. However, they either utilize web data that differs from
robotic tasks, or train the model in an implicit way (e.g., predicting future
frames at the pixel level), thus showing limited generalization ability under
insufficient robot data. In this paper, we propose to learn from large-scale
human action video datasets in an explicit way (i.e., imitating human actions
from hand keypoints), introducing Visual Robot Manipulation with Analogical
Reasoning (AR-VRM). To acquire action knowledge explicitly from human action
videos, we propose a keypoint Vision-Language Model (VLM) pretraining scheme,
enabling the VLM to learn human action knowledge and directly predict human
hand keypoints. During fine-tuning on robot data, to facilitate the robotic arm
in imitating the action patterns of human motions, we first retrieve human
action videos that perform similar manipulation tasks and have similar
historical observations , and then learn the Analogical Reasoning (AR) map
between human hand keypoints and robot components. Taking advantage of focusing
on action keypoints instead of irrelevant visual cues, our method achieves
leading performance on the CALVIN benchmark {and real-world experiments}. In
few-shot scenarios, our AR-VRM outperforms previous methods by large margins ,
underscoring the effectiveness of explicitly imitating human actions under data
scarcity.

Result: 在遮挡准确性上显著优于现有方法，并能调整透明度等效果。

Conclusion: 该方法基于物理原理，实现了高精度的遮挡控制，扩展了生成图像的多样性。

Abstract: We propose a novel training-free image generation algorithm that precisely
controls the occlusion relationships between objects in an image. Existing
image generation methods typically rely on prompts to influence occlusion,
which often lack precision. While layout-to-image methods provide control over
object locations, they fail to address occlusion relationships explicitly.
Given a pre-trained image diffusion model, our method leverages volume
rendering principles to "render" the scene in latent space, guided by occlusion
relationships and the estimated transmittance of objects. This approach does
not require retraining or fine-tuning the image diffusion model, yet it enables
accurate occlusion control due to its physics-grounded foundation. In extensive
experiments, our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms
of occlusion accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by adjusting the
opacities of objects or concepts during rendering, our method can achieve a
variety of effects, such as altering the transparency of objects, the density
of mass (e.g., forests), the concentration of particles (e.g., rain, fog), the
intensity of light, and the strength of lens effects, etc.

Motivation: 由于SAR数据标注需要专业知识，噪声标签不可避免，导致ATR性能下降。现有研究主要针对图像数据，而SAR数据的非直观特性使其难以实现噪声鲁棒学习。

Result: 在MSTAR数据集上的实验表明，该方法在不同噪声条件下均能达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CLSDF方法通过结合物理特征和深度学习，有效提升了SAR ATR在噪声标签下的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: The acquisition of high-quality labeled synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data
is challenging due to the demanding requirement for expert knowledge.
Consequently, the presence of unreliable noisy labels is unavoidable, which
results in performance degradation of SAR automatic target recognition (ATR).
Existing research on learning with noisy labels mainly focuses on image data.
However, the non-intuitive visual characteristics of SAR data are insufficient
to achieve noise-robust learning. To address this problem, we propose
collaborative learning of scattering and deep features (CLSDF) for SAR ATR with
noisy labels. Specifically, a multi-model feature fusion framework is designed
to integrate scattering and deep features. The attributed scattering centers
(ASCs) are treated as dynamic graph structure data, and the extracted physical
characteristics effectively enrich the representation of deep image features.
Then, the samples with clean and noisy labels are divided by modeling the loss
distribution with multiple class-wise Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs).
Afterward, the semi-supervised learning of two divergent branches is conducted
based on the data divided by each other. Moreover, a joint distribution
alignment strategy is introduced to enhance the reliability of co-guessed
labels. Extensive experiments have been done on the Moving and Stationary
Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR) dataset, and the results show that
the proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance under different
operating conditions with various label noises.

completion rule in current VTON models, which leads to inaccurate skin
restoration in such cases. To address this, we propose UR-VTON (Undress-Redress
Virtual Try-ON), a novel, training-free framework that can be seamlessly
integrated with any existing VTON method. UR-VTON introduces an
''undress-to-redress'' mechanism: it first reveals the user's torso by
virtually ''undressing,'' then applies the target short-sleeve garment,
effectively decomposing the conversion into two more manageable steps.
Additionally, we incorporate Dynamic Classifier-Free Guidance scheduling to
balance diversity and image quality during DDPM sampling, and employ Structural
Refiner to enhance detail fidelity using high-frequency cues. Finally, we
present LS-TON, a new benchmark for long-sleeve-to-short-sleeve try-on.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that UR-VTON outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in both detail preservation and image quality. Code will be released
upon acceptance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法未能显式约束推理过程，影响了视频片段定位的准确性。

Method: 提出TAR-TVG框架，引入时间戳锚点作为中间验证点，并通过三阶段训练策略（GRPO训练、监督微调、GRPO优化）提升模型性能。

Result: 实验表明，该模型在性能上达到最优，并生成可解释、可验证的推理链。

Conclusion: TAR-TVG通过显式监督和渐进优化的推理过程，显著提升了视频片段定位的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Temporal Video Grounding (TVG) aims to precisely localize video segments
corresponding to natural language queries, which is a critical capability for
long-form video understanding. Although existing reinforcement learning
approaches encourage models to generate reasoning chains before predictions,
they fail to explicitly constrain the reasoning process to ensure the quality
of the final temporal predictions. To address this limitation, we propose
Timestamp Anchor-constrained Reasoning for Temporal Video Grounding (TAR-TVG),
a novel framework that introduces timestamp anchors within the reasoning
process to enforce explicit supervision to the thought content. These anchors
serve as intermediate verification points. More importantly, we require each
reasoning step to produce increasingly accurate temporal estimations, thereby
ensuring that the reasoning process contributes meaningfully to the final
prediction. To address the challenge of low-probability anchor generation in
models (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-3B), we develop an efficient self-distillation
training strategy: (1) initial GRPO training to collect 30K high-quality
reasoning traces containing multiple timestamp anchors, (2) supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on distilled data, and (3) final GRPO optimization on the
SFT-enhanced model. This three-stage training strategy enables robust anchor
generation while maintaining reasoning quality. Experiments show that our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance while producing interpretable, verifiable
reasoning chains with progressively refined temporal estimations.

Motivation: 用户希望在3D生成内容上进行颜色、风格和光照编辑，但现有2D编辑工具直接应用于3D生成会导致信息丢失和质量下降。

Method: 提出几何保留模块和注入切换器，通过原始法线潜变量指导编辑的多视图生成，并控制法线监督程度。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了编辑后3D资产的多视图一致性和网格质量。

Conclusion: 该方法在多种多视图扩散模型和编辑方法组合中均表现出色，有效解决了编辑与几何对齐的问题。

Abstract: As 3D generation techniques continue to flourish, the demand for generating
personalized content is rapidly rising. Users increasingly seek to apply
various editing methods to polish generated 3D content, aiming to enhance its
color, style, and lighting without compromising the underlying geometry.
However, most existing editing tools focus on the 2D domain, and directly
feeding their results into 3D generation methods (like multi-view diffusion
models) will introduce information loss, degrading the quality of the final 3D
assets. In this paper, we propose a tuning-free, plug-and-play scheme that
aligns edited assets with their original geometry in a single inference run.
Central to our approach is a geometry preservation module that guides the
edited multi-view generation with original input normal latents. Besides, an
injection switcher is proposed to deliberately control the supervision extent
of the original normals, ensuring the alignment between the edited color and
normal views. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently improves
both the multi-view consistency and mesh quality of edited 3D assets, across
multiple combinations of multi-view diffusion models and editing methods.

Conclusion: 该方法通过多视角约束实现了几何深度统一和高精度重建，适用于小规模室内外场景。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves remarkable results in the field of
surface reconstruction. However, when Gaussian normal vectors are aligned
within the single-view projection plane, while the geometry appears reasonable
in the current view, biases may emerge upon switching to nearby views. To
address the distance and global matching challenges in multi-view scenes, we
design multi-view normal and distance-guided Gaussian splatting. This method
achieves geometric depth unification and high-accuracy reconstruction by
constraining nearby depth maps and aligning 3D normals. Specifically, for the
reconstruction of small indoor and outdoor scenes, we propose a multi-view
distance reprojection regularization module that achieves multi-view Gaussian
alignment by computing the distance loss between two nearby views and the same
Gaussian surface. Additionally, we develop a multi-view normal enhancement
module, which ensures consistency across views by matching the normals of pixel
points in nearby views and calculating the loss. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline in both quantitative and
qualitative evaluations, significantly enhancing the surface reconstruction
capability of 3DGS.

Abstract: Accurate detection and classification of diverse door types in floor plans
drawings is critical for multiple applications, such as building compliance
checking, and indoor scene understanding. Despite their importance, publicly
available datasets specifically designed for fine-grained multi-class door
detection remain scarce. In this work, we present a semi-automated pipeline
that leverages a state-of-the-art object detector and a large language model
(LLM) to construct a multi-class door detection dataset with minimal manual
effort. Doors are first detected as a unified category using a deep object
detection model. Next, an LLM classifies each detected instance based on its
visual and contextual features. Finally, a human-in-the-loop stage ensures
high-quality labels and bounding boxes. Our method significantly reduces
annotation cost while producing a dataset suitable for benchmarking neural
models in floor plan analysis. This work demonstrates the potential of
combining deep learning and multimodal reasoning for efficient dataset
construction in complex real-world domains.

Conclusion: 提出的星形分割模型在复杂场景下表现优异，为图像分割提供了新工具。

Abstract: Image segmentation plays a crucial role in extracting objects of interest and
identifying their boundaries within an image. However, accurate segmentation
becomes challenging when dealing with occlusions, obscurities, or noise in
corrupted images. To tackle this challenge, prior information is often
utilized, with recent attention on star-shape priors. In this paper, we propose
a star-shape segmentation model based on the registration framework. By
combining the level set representation with the registration framework and
imposing constraints on the deformed level set function, our model enables both
full and partial star-shape segmentation, accommodating single or multiple
centers. Additionally, our approach allows for the enforcement of identified
boundaries to pass through specified landmark locations. We tackle the proposed
models using the alternating direction method of multipliers. Through numerical
experiments conducted on synthetic and real images, we demonstrate the efficacy
of our approach in achieving accurate star-shape segmentation.

Result: 实验显示TriReWeight在自然和医学图像数据集上平均优于现有方法7.9%和3.4%。

Conclusion: TriReWeight可提升多种生成数据增强方法性能，理论泛化接近最优。

Abstract: The performance of computer vision models in certain real-world applications,
such as medical diagnosis, is often limited by the scarcity of available
images. Expanding datasets using pre-trained generative models is an effective
solution. However, due to the uncontrollable generation process and the
ambiguity of natural language, noisy images may be generated. Re-weighting is
an effective way to address this issue by assigning low weights to such noisy
images. We first theoretically analyze three types of supervision for the
generated images. Based on the theoretical analysis, we develop TriReWeight, a
triplet-connection-based sample re-weighting method to enhance generative data
augmentation. Theoretically, TriReWeight can be integrated with any generative
data augmentation methods and never downgrade their performance. Moreover, its
generalization approaches the optimal in the order $O(\sqrt{d\ln (n)/n})$. Our
experiments validate the correctness of the theoretical analysis and
demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing SOTA methods by $7.9\%$ on
average over six natural image datasets and by $3.4\%$ on average over three
medical datasets. We also experimentally validate that our method can enhance
the performance of different generative data augmentation methods.

Motivation: 自回归图像模型推理时间长，限制了其实际应用。现有加速方法效果有限或需额外训练。

Method: 利用图像令牌的冗余性和多样性，提出动态分组推测解码策略，评估视觉有效令牌簇而非单一目标令牌。

Result: 实验表明GSD平均加速3.7倍，且无需额外训练。

Conclusion: GSD是一种高效且实用的自回归图像模型加速方法。

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive (AR) image models have demonstrated remarkable
generative capabilities, positioning themselves as a compelling alternative to
diffusion models. However, their sequential nature leads to long inference
times, limiting their practical scalability. In this work, we introduce Grouped
Speculative Decoding (GSD), a novel, training-free acceleration method for AR
image models. While recent studies have explored Speculative Decoding (SD) as a
means to speed up AR image generation, existing approaches either provide only
modest acceleration or require additional training. Our in-depth analysis
reveals a fundamental difference between language and image tokens: image
tokens exhibit inherent redundancy and diversity, meaning multiple tokens can
convey valid semantics. However, traditional SD methods are designed to accept
only a single most-likely token, which fails to leverage this difference,
leading to excessive false-negative rejections. To address this, we propose a
new SD strategy that evaluates clusters of visually valid tokens rather than
relying on a single target token. Additionally, we observe that static
clustering based on embedding distance is ineffective, which motivates our
dynamic GSD approach. Extensive experiments show that GSD accelerates AR image
models by an average of 3.7x while preserving image quality-all without
requiring any additional training. The source code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法依赖额外指导（如文本提示或空间掩码）提取共同概念，可能导致辅助特征分离不完整，影响生成质量。

Method: 通过对比学习训练目标标记和图像辅助文本标记，提取解耦的真实语义，并应用解耦交叉注意力微调以提高概念保真度。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在概念表示和编辑方面均表现出色，优于现有技术。

Conclusion: Contrastive Inversion方法无需额外信息即可高效提取共同概念，生成质量高且概念保真度好。

Abstract: The recent demand for customized image generation raises a need for
techniques that effectively extract the common concept from small sets of
images. Existing methods typically rely on additional guidance, such as text
prompts or spatial masks, to capture the common target concept. Unfortunately,
relying on manually provided guidance can lead to incomplete separation of
auxiliary features, which degrades generation quality.In this paper, we propose
Contrastive Inversion, a novel approach that identifies the common concept by
comparing the input images without relying on additional information. We train
the target token along with the image-wise auxiliary text tokens via
contrastive learning, which extracts the well-disentangled true semantics of
the target. Then we apply disentangled cross-attention fine-tuning to improve
concept fidelity without overfitting. Experimental results and analysis
demonstrate that our method achieves a balanced, high-level performance in both
concept representation and editing, outperforming existing techniques.

Motivation: 现有参考分割方法依赖元学习，需要大量数据和计算成本，而CAV-SAM旨在以更轻量的方式解决这一问题。

Method: CAV-SAM包含两个模块：DBST（基于扩散的语义转换）和TTGA（测试时几何对齐），分别处理语义转换和几何对齐。

Result: 在广泛使用的数据集上，CAV-SAM的分割性能比现有最优方法提高了5%以上。

Conclusion: CAV-SAM为轻量级适应视觉模型提供了一种有效的新方向。

Abstract: Large vision models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibit significant
limitations when applied to downstream tasks in the wild. Consequently,
reference segmentation, which leverages reference images and their
corresponding masks to impart novel knowledge to the model, emerges as a
promising new direction for adapting vision models. However, existing reference
segmentation approaches predominantly rely on meta-learning, which still
necessitates an extensive meta-training process and brings massive data and
computational cost. In this study, we propose a novel approach by representing
the inherent correspondence between reference-target image pairs as a pseudo
video. This perspective allows the latest version of SAM, known as SAM2, which
is equipped with interactive video object segmentation (iVOS) capabilities, to
be adapted to downstream tasks in a lightweight manner. We term this approach
Correspondence As Video for SAM (CAV-SAM). CAV-SAM comprises two key modules:
the Diffusion-Based Semantic Transition (DBST) module employs a diffusion model
to construct a semantic transformation sequence, while the Test-Time Geometric
Alignment (TTGA) module aligns the geometric changes within this sequence
through test-time fine-tuning. We evaluated CAVSAM on widely-used datasets,
achieving segmentation performance improvements exceeding 5% over SOTA methods.
Implementation is provided in the supplementary materials.

Conclusion: UniSVG为SVG理解和生成提供了统一解决方案，推动了多模态模型在该领域的应用。

Abstract: Unlike bitmap images, scalable vector graphics (SVG) maintain quality when
scaled, frequently employed in computer vision and artistic design in the
representation of SVG code. In this era of proliferating AI-powered systems,
enabling AI to understand and generate SVG has become increasingly urgent.
However, AI-driven SVG understanding and generation (U&G) remain significant
challenges. SVG code, equivalent to a set of curves and lines controlled by
floating-point parameters, demands high precision in SVG U&G. Besides, SVG
generation operates under diverse conditional constraints, including textual
prompts and visual references, which requires powerful multi-modal processing
for condition-to-SVG transformation. Recently, the rapid growth of Multi-modal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated capabilities to process
multi-modal inputs and generate complex vector controlling parameters,
suggesting the potential to address SVG U&G tasks within a unified model. To
unlock MLLM's capabilities in the SVG area, we propose an SVG-centric dataset
called UniSVG, comprising 525k data items, tailored for MLLM training and
evaluation. To our best knowledge, it is the first comprehensive dataset
designed for unified SVG generation (from textual prompts and images) and SVG
understanding (color, category, usage, etc.). As expected, learning on the
proposed dataset boosts open-source MLLMs' performance on various SVG U&G
tasks, surpassing SOTA close-source MLLMs like GPT-4V. We release dataset,

Result: 框架首次结合视频扩散模型的时间先验和重建模型的几何感知，显著提升4D生成质量（如mPSNR、mSSIM）。

Conclusion: Dream4D通过创新方法解决了4D内容合成的关键挑战，表现出更高的质量和一致性。

Abstract: The synthesis of spatiotemporally coherent 4D content presents fundamental
challenges in computer vision, requiring simultaneous modeling of high-fidelity
spatial representations and physically plausible temporal dynamics. Current
approaches often struggle to maintain view consistency while handling complex
scene dynamics, particularly in large-scale environments with multiple
interacting elements. This work introduces Dream4D, a novel framework that
bridges this gap through a synergy of controllable video generation and neural
4D reconstruction. Our approach seamlessly combines a two-stage architecture:
it first predicts optimal camera trajectories from a single image using
few-shot learning, then generates geometrically consistent multi-view sequences
via a specialized pose-conditioned diffusion process, which are finally
converted into a persistent 4D representation. This framework is the first to
leverage both rich temporal priors from video diffusion models and geometric
awareness of the reconstruction models, which significantly facilitates 4D
generation and shows higher quality (e.g., mPSNR, mSSIM) over existing methods.

Result: 在AWA2、SUN和CUB数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: CLZSL框架通过减少噪声监督，显著提升了零样本学习的性能。

Abstract: In Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL), embedding-based methods enable knowledge
transfer from seen to unseen classes by learning a visual-semantic mapping from
seen-class images to class-level semantic prototypes (e.g., attributes).
However, these semantic prototypes are manually defined and may introduce noisy
supervision for two main reasons: (i) instance-level mismatch: variations in
perspective, occlusion, and annotation bias will cause discrepancies between
individual sample and the class-level semantic prototypes; and (ii) class-level
imprecision: the manually defined semantic prototypes may not accurately
reflect the true semantics of the class. Consequently, the visual-semantic
mapping will be misled, reducing the effectiveness of knowledge transfer to
unseen classes. In this work, we propose a prototype-guided curriculum learning
framework (dubbed as CLZSL), which mitigates instance-level mismatches through
a Prototype-Guided Curriculum Learning (PCL) module and addresses class-level
imprecision via a Prototype Update (PUP) module. Specifically, the PCL module
prioritizes samples with high cosine similarity between their visual mappings
and the class-level semantic prototypes, and progressively advances to
less-aligned samples, thereby reducing the interference of instance-level
mismatches to achieve accurate visual-semantic mapping. Besides, the PUP module
dynamically updates the class-level semantic prototypes by leveraging the
visual mappings learned from instances, thereby reducing class-level
imprecision and further improving the visual-semantic mapping. Experiments were
conducted on standard benchmark datasets-AWA2, SUN, and CUB-to verify the
effectiveness of our method.

Conclusion: 该方法为SO(3)外推提供了一种鲁棒且通用的解决方案，易于集成到现有流程中，适用于复杂动态系统。

Abstract: Modeling the rotation of moving objects is a fundamental task in computer
vision, yet $SO(3)$ extrapolation still presents numerous challenges: (1)
unknown quantities such as the moment of inertia complicate dynamics, (2) the
presence of external forces and torques can lead to non-conservative
kinematics, and (3) estimating evolving state trajectories under sparse, noisy
observations requires robustness. We propose modeling trajectories of noisy
pose estimates on the manifold of 3D rotations in a physically and
geometrically meaningful way by leveraging Neural Controlled Differential
Equations guided with $SO(3)$ Savitzky-Golay paths. Existing extrapolation
methods often rely on energy conservation or constant velocity assumptions,
limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios involving non-conservative
forces. In contrast, our approach is agnostic to energy and momentum
conservation while being robust to input noise, making it applicable to
complex, non-inertial systems. Our approach is easily integrated as a module in
existing pipelines and generalizes well to trajectories with unknown physical
parameters. By learning to approximate object dynamics from noisy states during
training, our model attains robust extrapolation capabilities in simulation and
various real-world settings. Code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法展示了snippet在步态识别中的潜力，为未来研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Recent advancements in gait recognition have significantly enhanced
performance by treating silhouettes as either an unordered set or an ordered
sequence. However, both set-based and sequence-based approaches exhibit notable
limitations. Specifically, set-based methods tend to overlook short-range
temporal context for individual frames, while sequence-based methods struggle
to capture long-range temporal dependencies effectively. To address these
challenges, we draw inspiration from human identification and propose a new
perspective that conceptualizes human gait as a composition of individualized
actions. Each action is represented by a series of frames, randomly selected
from a continuous segment of the sequence, which we term a snippet.
Fundamentally, the collection of snippets for a given sequence enables the
incorporation of multi-scale temporal context, facilitating more comprehensive
gait feature learning. Moreover, we introduce a non-trivial solution for
snippet-based gait recognition, focusing on Snippet Sampling and Snippet
Modeling as key components. Extensive experiments on four widely-used gait
datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach and, more
importantly, highlight the potential of gait snippets. For instance, our method
achieves the rank-1 accuracy of 77.5% on Gait3D and 81.7% on GREW using a 2D
convolution-based backbone.

Conclusion: TSDF通过双重功能的对抗扰动，实现了对深度伪造技术的持久防御，解决了现有防御策略的不足。

Abstract: Active defense strategies have been developed to counter the threat of
deepfake technology. However, a primary challenge is their lack of persistence,
as their effectiveness is often short-lived. Attackers can bypass these
defenses by simply collecting protected samples and retraining their models.
This means that static defenses inevitably fail when attackers retrain their
models, which severely limits practical use. We argue that an effective defense
not only distorts forged content but also blocks the model's ability to adapt,
which occurs when attackers retrain their models on protected images. To
achieve this, we propose an innovative Two-Stage Defense Framework (TSDF).
Benefiting from the intensity separation mechanism designed in this paper, the
framework uses dual-function adversarial perturbations to perform two roles.
First, it can directly distort the forged results. Second, it acts as a
poisoning vehicle that disrupts the data preparation process essential for an
attacker's retraining pipeline. By poisoning the data source, TSDF aims to
prevent the attacker's model from adapting to the defensive perturbations, thus
ensuring the defense remains effective long-term. Comprehensive experiments
show that the performance of traditional interruption methods degrades sharply
when it is subjected to adversarial retraining. However, our framework shows a
strong dual defense capability, which can improve the persistence of active
defense. Our code will be available at https://github.com/vpsg-research/TSDF.

Abstract: Power batteries are essential components in electric vehicles, where internal
structural defects can pose serious safety risks. We conduct a comprehensive
study on a new task, power battery detection (PBD), which aims to localize the
dense endpoints of cathode and anode plates from industrial X-ray images for
quality inspection. Manual inspection is inefficient and error-prone, while
traditional vision algorithms struggle with densely packed plates, low
contrast, scale variation, and imaging artifacts. To address this issue and
drive more attention into this meaningful task, we present PBD5K, the first
large-scale benchmark for this task, consisting of 5,000 X-ray images from nine
battery types with fine-grained annotations and eight types of real-world
visual interference. To support scalable and consistent labeling, we develop an
intelligent annotation pipeline that combines image filtering, model-assisted
pre-labeling, cross-verification, and layered quality evaluation. We formulate
PBD as a point-level segmentation problem and propose MDCNeXt, a model designed
to extract and integrate multi-dimensional structure clues including point,
line, and count information from the plate itself. To improve discrimination
between plates and suppress visual interference, MDCNeXt incorporates two state
space modules. The first is a prompt-filtered module that learns contrastive
relationships guided by task-specific prompts. The second is a density-aware
reordering module that refines segmentation in regions with high plate density.
In addition, we propose a distance-adaptive mask generation strategy to provide
robust supervision under varying spatial distributions of anode and cathode
positions. The source code and datasets will be publicly available at
\href{https://github.com/Xiaoqi-Zhao-DLUT/X-ray-PBD}{PBD5K}.

TL;DR: MambaTrans是一种新型多模态融合图像模态翻译器，旨在解决可见图像与多模态融合图像之间的像素分布差异问题，提升下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有下游预训练模型通常基于可见图像训练，而多模态融合图像与可见图像的像素分布差异会导致下游任务性能下降。

Method: MambaTrans利用多模态大语言模型的描述和语义分割模型的掩码作为输入，通过Multi-Model State Space Block结合掩码-图像-文本交叉注意力和3D选择性扫描模块，增强纯视觉能力。

Result: 实验表明，MambaTrans在不调整预训练模型参数的情况下，有效提升了多模态图像在下游任务中的性能。

Conclusion: MambaTrans通过结合多模态信息和先验知识，成功解决了多模态融合图像与可见图像之间的适配问题。

Abstract: The goal of multimodal image fusion is to integrate complementary information
from infrared and visible images, generating multimodal fused images for
downstream tasks. Existing downstream pre-training models are typically trained
on visible images. However, the significant pixel distribution differences
between visible and multimodal fusion images can degrade downstream task
performance, sometimes even below that of using only visible images. This paper
explores adapting multimodal fused images with significant modality differences
to object detection and semantic segmentation models trained on visible images.
To address this, we propose MambaTrans, a novel multimodal fusion image
modality translator. MambaTrans uses descriptions from a multimodal large
language model and masks from semantic segmentation models as input. Its core
component, the Multi-Model State Space Block, combines mask-image-text
cross-attention and a 3D-Selective Scan Module, enhancing pure visual
capabilities. By leveraging object detection prior knowledge, MambaTrans
minimizes detection loss during training and captures long-term dependencies
among text, masks, and images. This enables favorable results in pre-trained
models without adjusting their parameters. Experiments on public datasets show
that MambaTrans effectively improves multimodal image performance in downstream
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在3D姿态生成中存在模糊性和任务对齐不足的问题，Pose-RFT旨在解决这些局限性。

Method: 采用混合动作强化学习（HyGRPO算法），结合任务特定的奖励函数，优化离散语言预测和连续姿态生成。

Result: 在多个姿态生成基准测试中，Pose-RFT显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 混合动作强化微调对3D姿态生成有效，Pose-RFT展示了其优越性。

Abstract: Generating 3D human poses from multimodal inputs such as images or text
requires models to capture both rich spatial and semantic correspondences.
While pose-specific multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise
in this task, they are typically trained with supervised objectives such as
SMPL parameter regression or token-level prediction, which struggle to model
the inherent ambiguity and achieve task-specific alignment required for
accurate 3D pose generation. To address these limitations, we propose Pose-RFT,
a reinforcement fine-tuning framework tailored for 3D human pose generation in
MLLMs. We formulate the task as a hybrid action reinforcement learning problem
that jointly optimizes discrete language prediction and continuous pose
generation. To this end, we introduce HyGRPO, a hybrid reinforcement learning
algorithm that performs group-wise reward normalization over sampled responses
to guide joint optimization of discrete and continuous actions. Pose-RFT
further incorporates task-specific reward functions to guide optimization
towards spatial alignment in image-to-pose generation and semantic consistency
in text-to-pose generation. Extensive experiments on multiple pose generation
benchmarks demonstrate that Pose-RFT significantly improves performance over
existing pose-specific MLLMs, validating the effectiveness of hybrid action
reinforcement fine-tuning for 3D pose generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统回归方法生成不真实细节且需大量配对数据，生成扩散模型难以保证时间一致性。DiTVR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用扩散变换器与轨迹感知注意力机制，结合光流轨迹对齐令牌，动态选择相关令牌，并使用小波引导的流一致采样器。

Result: DiTVR在视频修复基准测试中达到零样本最优，时间一致性和细节保留表现优异，且对光流噪声和遮挡鲁棒。

Conclusion: DiTVR通过创新的注意力机制和采样器设计，显著提升了视频修复的质量和效率。

Abstract: Video restoration aims to reconstruct high quality video sequences from low
quality inputs, addressing tasks such as super resolution, denoising, and
deblurring. Traditional regression based methods often produce unrealistic
details and require extensive paired datasets, while recent generative
diffusion models face challenges in ensuring temporal consistency. We introduce
DiTVR, a zero shot video restoration framework that couples a diffusion
transformer with trajectory aware attention and a wavelet guided, flow
consistent sampler. Unlike prior 3D convolutional or frame wise diffusion
approaches, our attention mechanism aligns tokens along optical flow
trajectories, with particular emphasis on vital layers that exhibit the highest
sensitivity to temporal dynamics. A spatiotemporal neighbour cache dynamically
selects relevant tokens based on motion correspondences across frames. The flow
guided sampler injects data consistency only into low-frequency bands,
preserving high frequency priors while accelerating convergence. DiTVR
establishes a new zero shot state of the art on video restoration benchmarks,
demonstrating superior temporal consistency and detail preservation while
remaining robust to flow noise and occlusions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SAR-光学图像匹配方法依赖像素级标注，耗时且难以获取足够标注数据，因此需要一种半监督方法减少标注需求。

Method: 设计半监督匹配流程，利用伪标签生成相似性热图，结合跨模态特征增强模块，通过无监督目标分离模态共享和特定特征。

Result: S2M2-SAR在基准数据集上表现优于半监督方法，并与全监督方法竞争，展示了高效性和实用潜力。

Conclusion: S2M2-SAR通过半监督学习和跨模态特征增强，显著减少标注需求，同时保持高性能，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Driven by the complementary nature of optical and synthetic aperture radar
(SAR) images, SAR-optical image matching has garnered significant interest.
Most existing SAR-optical image matching methods aim to capture effective
matching features by employing the supervision of pixel-level matched
correspondences within SAR-optical image pairs, which, however, suffers from
time-consuming and complex manual annotation, making it difficult to collect
sufficient labeled SAR-optical image pairs. To handle this, we design a
semi-supervised SAR-optical image matching pipeline that leverages both scarce
labeled and abundant unlabeled image pairs and propose a semi-supervised
multiscale matching for SAR-optical image matching (S2M2-SAR). Specifically, we
pseudo-label those unlabeled SAR-optical image pairs with pseudo ground-truth
similarity heatmaps by combining both deep and shallow level matching results,
and train the matching model by employing labeled and pseudo-labeled similarity
heatmaps. In addition, we introduce a cross-modal feature enhancement module
trained using a cross-modality mutual independence loss, which requires no
ground-truth labels. This unsupervised objective promotes the separation of
modality-shared and modality-specific features by encouraging statistical
independence between them, enabling effective feature disentanglement across
optical and SAR modalities. To evaluate the effectiveness of S2M2-SAR, we
compare it with existing competitors on benchmark datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that S2M2-SAR not only surpasses existing semi-supervised
methods but also achieves performance competitive with fully supervised SOTA
methods, demonstrating its efficiency and practical potential.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无参考图像质量评估方法对语义显著区域的关注不足或对局部质量变化的敏感性较弱，RSFIQA旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用Segment Anything Model动态分割图像，结合多模态大语言模型提取区域特征，并引入区域感知语义注意力机制。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现出色，具有竞争性的质量预测性能。

Conclusion: RSFIQA通过细粒度区域分析和注意力机制，显著提升了无参考图像质量评估的效果。

Abstract: No-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) aims to simulate the process
of perceiving image quality aligned with subjective human perception. However,
existing NR-IQA methods either focus on global representations that leads to
limited insights into the semantically salient regions or employ a uniform
weighting for region features that weakens the sensitivity to local quality
variations. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained image quality assessment
model, named RSFIQA, which integrates region-level distortion information to
perceive multi-dimensional quality discrepancies. To enhance regional quality
awareness, we first utilize the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to dynamically
partition the input image into non-overlapping semantic regions. For each
region, we teach a powerful Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to extract
descriptive content and perceive multi-dimensional distortions, enabling a
comprehensive understanding of both local semantics and quality degradations.
To effectively leverage this information, we introduce Region-Aware Semantic
Attention (RSA) mechanism, which generates a global attention map by
aggregating fine-grained representations from local regions. In addition,
RSFIQA is backbone-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into various deep
neural network architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness
and effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves competitive quality
prediction performance across multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: 协同设计框架为密集感知任务中的基础模型提供了稳健的适应能力。

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face a significant adaptation gap
when applied to Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD), stemming from their lack of
local inductive biases for dense prediction and their reliance on inflexible
feature fusion paradigms. We address these limitations through an Architectural
Co-Design framework that jointly refines feature representation and cross-modal
fusion. Our method integrates a parameter-efficient Convolutional Low-Rank
Adaptation (Conv-LoRA) adapter to inject local inductive biases for
fine-grained representation, and introduces a Dynamic Fusion Gateway (DFG) that
leverages visual context to adaptively modulate text prompts, enabling a
powerful bidirectional fusion. Extensive experiments on diverse industrial and
medical benchmarks demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness, validating
that this synergistic co-design is critical for robustly adapting foundation
models to dense perception tasks.

Result: 通过定量和定性评估，MIMIC在自由文本输出上成功反演视觉概念，并报告了视觉质量和语义指标。

Conclusion: MIMIC是首个针对VLM视觉概念解释的反演方法，为模型透明度提供了新途径。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) encode multimodal inputs over large, complex,
and difficult-to-interpret architectures, which limit transparency and trust.
We propose a Multimodal Inversion for Model Interpretation and
Conceptualization (MIMIC) framework to visualize the internal representations
of VLMs by synthesizing visual concepts corresponding to internal encodings.
MIMIC uses a joint VLM-based inversion and a feature alignment objective to
account for VLM's autoregressive processing. It additionally includes a triplet
of regularizers for spatial alignment, natural image smoothness, and semantic
realism. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate MIMIC by inverting visual
concepts over a range of varying-length free-form VLM output texts. Reported
results include both standard visual quality metrics as well as semantic
text-based metrics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model
inversion approach addressing visual interpretations of VLM concepts.

Motivation: 尽管通用视觉语言模型（如CONCH和QuiltNet）在组织病理学中表现出色，但其通用设计可能导致在特定下游任务中性能不佳。传统的有监督微调需要人工标注数据，限制了其应用。

Method: 通过从现有数据库中提取领域和任务相关的图像-文本对，对VLMs进行无标注的继续预训练。

Result: 实验表明，这种无标注的继续预训练显著提升了零样本和小样本性能，且在大规模训练时，其性能可与小样本方法媲美。

Conclusion: 无标注的继续预训练是一种高效、任务无关且无需人工标注的方法，为VLMs在组织病理学任务中的适配提供了新途径。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in histopathology, such as
CONCH and QuiltNet, have demonstrated impressive zero-shot classification
capabilities across various tasks. However, their general-purpose design may
lead to suboptimal performance in specific downstream applications. While
supervised fine-tuning methods address this issue, they require manually
labeled samples for adaptation. This paper investigates annotation-free
adaptation of VLMs through continued pretraining on domain- and task-relevant
image-caption pairs extracted from existing databases. Our experiments on two
VLMs, CONCH and QuiltNet, across three downstream tasks reveal that these pairs
substantially enhance both zero-shot and few-shot performance. Notably, with
larger training sizes, continued pretraining matches the performance of
few-shot methods while eliminating manual labeling. Its effectiveness,
task-agnostic design, and annotation-free workflow make it a promising pathway
for adapting VLMs to new histopathology tasks. Code is available at

Conclusion: CBDES MoE在自动驾驶领域展示了模块化混合专家框架的有效性和实用优势。

Abstract: Bird's Eye View (BEV) perception systems based on multi-sensor feature fusion
have become a fundamental cornerstone for end-to-end autonomous driving.
However, existing multi-modal BEV methods commonly suffer from limited input
adaptability, constrained modeling capacity, and suboptimal generalization. To
address these challenges, we propose a hierarchically decoupled
Mixture-of-Experts architecture at the functional module level, termed
Computing Brain DEvelopment System Mixture-of-Experts (CBDES MoE). CBDES MoE
integrates multiple structurally heterogeneous expert networks with a
lightweight Self-Attention Router (SAR) gating mechanism, enabling dynamic
expert path selection and sparse, input-aware efficient inference. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first modular Mixture-of-Experts framework
constructed at the functional module granularity within the autonomous driving
domain. Extensive evaluations on the real-world nuScenes dataset demonstrate
that CBDES MoE consistently outperforms fixed single-expert baselines in 3D
object detection. Compared to the strongest single-expert model, CBDES MoE
achieves a 1.6-point increase in mAP and a 4.1-point improvement in NDS,
demonstrating the effectiveness and practical advantages of the proposed
approach.

Conclusion: Deep SWM为太阳耀斑预测提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate, reliable solar flare prediction is crucial for mitigating potential
disruptions to critical infrastructure, while predicting solar flares remains a
significant challenge. Existing methods based on heuristic physical features
often lack representation learning from solar images. On the other hand,
end-to-end learning approaches struggle to model long-range temporal
dependencies in solar images. In this study, we propose Deep Space Weather
Model (Deep SWM), which is based on multiple deep state space models for
handling both ten-channel solar images and long-range spatio-temporal
dependencies. Deep SWM also features a sparse masked autoencoder, a novel
pretraining strategy that employs a two-phase masking approach to preserve
crucial regions such as sunspots while compressing spatial information.
Furthermore, we built FlareBench, a new public benchmark for solar flare
prediction covering a full 11-year solar activity cycle, to validate our
method. Our method outperformed baseline methods and even human expert
performance on standard metrics in terms of performance and reliability. The

Abstract: Minimally invasive surgery presents challenges such as dynamic tissue motion
and a limited field of view. Accurate tissue tracking has the potential to
support surgical guidance, improve safety by helping avoid damage to sensitive

procedures. In this work, we propose a novel method for markerless 3D tissue
tracking by leveraging 2D Tracking Any Point (TAP) networks. Our method
combines two CoTracker models, one for temporal tracking and one for stereo
matching, to estimate 3D motion from stereo endoscopic images. We evaluate the
system using a clinical laparoscopic setup and a robotic arm simulating tissue
motion, with experiments conducted on a synthetic 3D-printed phantom and a
chicken tissue phantom. Tracking on the chicken tissue phantom yielded more
reliable results, with Euclidean distance errors as low as 1.1 mm at a velocity
of 10 mm/s. These findings highlight the potential of TAP-based models for

Abstract: Human motion generation has emerged as a critical technology with
transformative potential for real-world applications. However, existing
vision-language-motion models (VLMMs) face significant limitations that hinder
their practical deployment. We identify controllability as a main bottleneck,
manifesting in five key aspects: inadequate response to diverse human commands,
limited pose initialization capabilities, poor performance on long-term
sequences, insufficient handling of unseen scenarios, and lack of fine-grained
control over individual body parts. To overcome these limitations, we present
Being-M0.5, the first real-time, controllable VLMM that achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple motion generation tasks. Our
approach is built upon HuMo100M, the largest and most comprehensive human
motion dataset to date, comprising over 5 million self-collected motion
sequences, 100 million multi-task instructional instances, and detailed
part-level annotations that address a critical gap in existing datasets. We
introduce a novel part-aware residual quantization technique for motion
tokenization that enables precise, granular control over individual body parts
during generation. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates Being-M0.5's
superior performance across diverse motion benchmarks, while comprehensive
efficiency analysis confirms its real-time capabilities. Our contributions
include design insights and detailed computational analysis to guide future
development of practical motion generators. We believe that HuMo100M and
Being-M0.5 represent significant advances that will accelerate the adoption of

### [173] [CATP: Contextually Adaptive Token Pruning for Efficient and Enhanced Multimodal In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07871)
*Yanshu Li,Jianjiang Yang,Zhennan Shen,Ligong Han,Haoyan Xu,Ruixiang Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 现代大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）通过将图像转换为大量令牌，导致冗余。现有修剪方法仅针对单图像任务，忽略多模态上下文学习（ICL）。本文提出CATP方法，通过两阶段修剪减少77.8%的图像令牌，性能提升0.6%，推理延迟降低10.78%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像令牌冗余增加了推理成本，现有修剪方法在多模态ICL中效果不佳，导致性能不稳定。

Method: 提出CATP方法，通过两阶段渐进式修剪，考虑输入序列中的跨模态交互。

Result: 修剪77.8%的图像令牌后，性能提升0.6%，推理延迟降低10.78%。

Conclusion: CATP提升了多模态ICL的实用价值，为未来图像-文本交错场景的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Modern large vision-language models (LVLMs) convert each input image into a
large set of tokens, far outnumbering the text tokens. Although this improves
visual perception, it introduces severe image token redundancy. Because image
tokens carry sparse information, many add little to reasoning, yet greatly
increase inference cost. The emerging image token pruning methods tackle this
issue by identifying the most important tokens and discarding the rest. These
methods can raise efficiency with only modest performance loss. However, most
of them only consider single-image tasks and overlook multimodal in-context
learning (ICL), where redundancy is greater and efficiency is more critical.
Redundant tokens weaken the advantage of multimodal ICL for rapid domain
adaptation and cause unstable performance. Applying existing pruning methods in
this setting leads to large accuracy drops, exposing a clear gap and the need
for new techniques. Thus, we propose Contextually Adaptive Token Pruning
(CATP), a training-free pruning method targeted at multimodal ICL. CATP
consists of two stages that perform progressive pruning to fully account for
the complex cross-modal interactions in the input sequence. After removing
77.8\% of the image tokens, CATP produces an average performance gain of 0.6\%
over the vanilla model on four LVLMs and eight benchmarks, exceeding all
baselines remarkably. Meanwhile, it effectively improves efficiency by
achieving an average reduction of 10.78\% in inference latency. CATP enhances
the practical value of multimodal ICL and lays the groundwork for future
progress in interleaved image-text scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种选择性原型和像素对比目标的方法，通过多视角学习和CLIP技术，有效识别与功能相关的部分，解决了弱监督功能定位中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弱监督功能定位（WSAG）通常依赖分类器，容易关注与功能无关的模式，因此需要更精准的方法。

Method: 结合选择性原型和像素对比目标，利用CLIP技术从不同视角挖掘功能相关线索，并通过对比学习区分功能相关与无关区域。

Result: 实验证明，该方法能有效将激活从无关区域转移到功能相关线索上。

Conclusion: 该方法在弱监督功能定位中表现出色，代码已开源。

Abstract: Facilitating an entity's interaction with objects requires accurately
identifying parts that afford specific actions. Weakly supervised affordance
grounding (WSAG) seeks to imitate human learning from third-person
demonstrations, where humans intuitively grasp functional parts without needing
pixel-level annotations. To achieve this, grounding is typically learned using
a shared classifier across images from different perspectives, along with
distillation strategies incorporating part discovery process. However, since
affordance-relevant parts are not always easily distinguishable, models
primarily rely on classification, often focusing on common class-specific
patterns that are unrelated to affordance. To address this limitation, we move
beyond isolated part-level learning by introducing selective prototypical and
pixel contrastive objectives that adaptively learn affordance-relevant cues at
both the part and object levels, depending on the granularity of the available
information. Initially, we find the action-associated objects in both
egocentric (object-focused) and exocentric (third-person example) images by
leveraging CLIP. Then, by cross-referencing the discovered objects of
complementary views, we excavate the precise part-level affordance clues in
each perspective. By consistently learning to distinguish affordance-relevant
regions from affordance-irrelevant background context, our approach effectively
shifts activation from irrelevant areas toward meaningful affordance cues.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Codes are
available at github.com/hynnsk/SelectiveCL.

Abstract: Image restoration under adverse weather conditions has been extensively
explored, leading to numerous high-performance methods. In particular, recent
advances in All-in-One approaches have shown impressive results by training on
multi-task image restoration datasets. However, most of these methods rely on
dedicated network modules or parameters for each specific degradation type,
resulting in a significant parameter overhead. Moreover, the relatedness across
different restoration tasks is often overlooked. In light of these issues, we
propose a parameter-efficient All-in-One image restoration framework that
leverages task-aware enhanced prompts to tackle various adverse weather
degradations.Specifically, we adopt a two-stage training paradigm consisting of
a pretraining phase and a prompt-tuning phase to mitigate parameter conflicts
across tasks. We first employ supervised learning to acquire general
restoration knowledge, and then adapt the model to handle specific degradation
via trainable soft prompts. Crucially, we enhance these task-specific prompts
in a task-aware manner. We apply low-rank decomposition to these prompts to
capture both task-general and task-specific characteristics, and impose
contrastive constraints to better align them with the actual inter-task
relatedness. These enhanced prompts not only improve the parameter efficiency
of the restoration model but also enable more accurate task modeling, as
evidenced by t-SNE analysis. Experimental results on different restoration
tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance with
only 2.75M parameters.

Conclusion: 动态高斯泼溅技术有效解决了数据稀缺问题，显著提升了手术自动化模型的性能。

Abstract: Computer vision-based technologies significantly enhance surgical automation
by advancing tool tracking, detection, and localization. However, Current
data-driven approaches are data-voracious, requiring large, high-quality
labeled image datasets, which limits their application in surgical data
science. Our Work introduces a novel dynamic Gaussian Splatting technique to
address the data scarcity in surgical image datasets. We propose a dynamic
Gaussian model to represent dynamic surgical scenes, enabling the rendering of
surgical instruments from unseen viewpoints and deformations with real tissue
backgrounds. We utilize a dynamic training adjustment strategy to address
challenges posed by poorly calibrated camera poses from real-world scenarios.
Additionally, we propose a method based on dynamic Gaussians for automatically
generating annotations for our synthetic data. For evaluation, we constructed a
new dataset featuring seven scenes with 14,000 frames of tool and camera motion
and tool jaw articulation, with a background of an ex-vivo porcine model. Using
this dataset, we synthetically replicate the scene deformation from the ground
truth data, allowing direct comparisons of synthetic image quality.
Experimental results illustrate that our method generates photo-realistic
labeled image datasets with the highest values in Peak-Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(29.87). We further evaluate the performance of medical-specific neural
networks trained on real and synthetic images using an unseen real-world image
dataset. Our results show that the performance of models trained on synthetic
images generated by the proposed method outperforms those trained with
state-of-the-art standard data augmentation by 10%, leading to an overall
improvement in model performances by nearly 15%.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖过多训练参数且与其他AIGC工具兼容性差，需改进身份保留的视频生成技术。

Method: 在预训练视频生成模型中引入条件图像分支，通过受限自注意力与条件位置映射实现身份控制，仅需2000对数据快速学习。

Result: 仅增加约1%参数，视频质量和身份保留效果优于全参数训练方法，且可无缝集成其他任务。

Conclusion: Stand-In框架高效、灵活，适用于多种视频生成任务。

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity human videos that match user-specified identities is
important yet challenging in the field of generative AI. Existing methods often
rely on an excessive number of training parameters and lack compatibility with
other AIGC tools. In this paper, we propose Stand-In, a lightweight and
plug-and-play framework for identity preservation in video generation.
Specifically, we introduce a conditional image branch into the pre-trained
video generation model. Identity control is achieved through restricted
self-attentions with conditional position mapping, and can be learned quickly
with only 2000 pairs. Despite incorporating and training just $\sim$1\%
additional parameters, our framework achieves excellent results in video
quality and identity preservation, outperforming other full-parameter training
methods. Moreover, our framework can be seamlessly integrated for other tasks,
such as subject-driven video generation, pose-referenced video generation,
stylization, and face swapping.

Abstract: Handwritten text recognition for historical documents remains challenging due
to handwriting variability, degraded sources, and limited layout-aware
annotations. In this work, we address annotation errors - particularly
hyphenation issues - in the Bullinger correspondence, a large 16th-century
letter collection. We introduce a self-training method based on a CTC alignment
algorithm that matches full transcriptions to text line images using dynamic
programming and model output probabilities trained with the CTC loss. Our
approach improves performance (e.g., by 1.1 percentage points CER with PyLaia)
and increases alignment accuracy. Interestingly, we find that weaker models
yield more accurate alignments, enabling an iterative training strategy. We
release a new manually corrected subset of 100 pages from the Bullinger
dataset, along with our code and benchmarks. Our approach can be applied
iteratively to further improve the CER as well as the alignment quality for
text recognition pipelines. Code and data are available via

Motivation: 传统视频抠图方法因缺乏高质量真实数据而受限，现有数据集多为人工标注的不完美数据，导致模型在真实场景中泛化能力差。

Method: 提出两个解决方案：1) 利用大规模合成和伪标注分割数据集进行预训练；2) 开发一种新型视频抠图方法，利用预训练视频扩散模型的先验知识，确保时间一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过合成数据和视频扩散模型的结合，显著提升了视频抠图的质量和泛化能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Video matting has traditionally been limited by the lack of high-quality
ground-truth data. Most existing video matting datasets provide only
human-annotated imperfect alpha and foreground annotations, which must be
composited to background images or videos during the training stage. Thus, the
generalization capability of previous methods in real-world scenarios is
typically poor. In this work, we propose to solve the problem from two
perspectives. First, we emphasize the importance of large-scale pre-training by
pursuing diverse synthetic and pseudo-labeled segmentation datasets. We also
develop a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline that can render diverse
human bodies and fine-grained hairs, yielding around 200 video clips with a
3-second duration for fine-tuning. Second, we introduce a novel video matting
approach that can effectively leverage the rich priors from pre-trained video
diffusion models. This architecture offers two key advantages. First, strong
priors play a critical role in bridging the domain gap between synthetic and
real-world scenes. Second, unlike most existing methods that process video
matting frame-by-frame and use an independent decoder to aggregate temporal
information, our model is inherently designed for video, ensuring strong
temporal consistency. We provide a comprehensive quantitative evaluation across
three benchmark datasets, demonstrating our approach's superior performance,
and present comprehensive qualitative results in diverse real-world scenes,
illustrating the strong generalization capability of our method. The code is

Result: 实验表明，Mem4D在保持高效的同时，实现了静态结构的全局一致性和动态元素的高保真重建。

Conclusion: Mem4D通过解耦静态和动态建模，显著提升了动态场景重建的性能。

Abstract: Reconstructing dense geometry for dynamic scenes from a monocular video is a
critical yet challenging task. Recent memory-based methods enable efficient
online reconstruction, but they fundamentally suffer from a Memory Demand
Dilemma: The memory representation faces an inherent conflict between the
long-term stability required for static structures and the rapid, high-fidelity
detail retention needed for dynamic motion. This conflict forces existing
methods into a compromise, leading to either geometric drift in static
structures or blurred, inaccurate reconstructions of dynamic objects. To
address this dilemma, we propose Mem4D, a novel framework that decouples the
modeling of static geometry and dynamic motion. Guided by this insight, we
design a dual-memory architecture: 1) The Transient Dynamics Memory (TDM)
focuses on capturing high-frequency motion details from recent frames, enabling
accurate and fine-grained modeling of dynamic content; 2) The Persistent
Structure Memory (PSM) compresses and preserves long-term spatial information,
ensuring global consistency and drift-free reconstruction for static elements.
By alternating queries to these specialized memories, Mem4D simultaneously
maintains static geometry with global consistency and reconstructs dynamic
elements with high fidelity. Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance while
maintaining high efficiency. Codes will be publicly available.

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) in remote sensing (RS) is pivotal for
interpreting Earth observation data. However, existing RS VQA datasets are
constrained by limitations in annotation richness, question diversity, and the
assessment of specific reasoning capabilities. This paper introduces RSVLM-QA
dataset, a new large-scale, content-rich VQA dataset for the RS domain.
RSVLM-QA is constructed by integrating data from several prominent RS
segmentation and detection datasets: WHU, LoveDA, INRIA, and iSAID. We employ
an innovative dual-track annotation generation pipeline. Firstly, we leverage
Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4.1, with meticulously designed
prompts to automatically generate a suite of detailed annotations including
image captions, spatial relations, and semantic tags, alongside complex
caption-based VQA pairs. Secondly, to address the challenging task of object
counting in RS imagery, we have developed a specialized automated process that
extracts object counts directly from the original segmentation data; GPT-4.1
then formulates natural language answers from these counts, which are paired
with preset question templates to create counting QA pairs. RSVLM-QA comprises
13,820 images and 162,373 VQA pairs, featuring extensive annotations and
diverse question types. We provide a detailed statistical analysis of the
dataset and a comparison with existing RS VQA benchmarks, highlighting the
superior depth and breadth of RSVLM-QA's annotations. Furthermore, we conduct
benchmark experiments on Six mainstream Vision Language Models (VLMs),
demonstrating that RSVLM-QA effectively evaluates and challenges the
understanding and reasoning abilities of current VLMs in the RS domain. We
believe RSVLM-QA will serve as a pivotal resource for the RS VQA and VLM
research communities, poised to catalyze advancements in the field.

Conclusion: TAG是一种简单有效的零样本视频时间定位方法，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to extract relevant video segments based
on a given natural language query. Recently, zero-shot VTG methods have gained
attention by leveraging pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) to localize
target moments without additional training. However, existing approaches suffer
from semantic fragmentation, where temporally continuous frames sharing the
same semantics are split across multiple segments. When segments are
fragmented, it becomes difficult to predict an accurate target moment that
aligns with the text query. Also, they rely on skewed similarity distributions
for localization, making it difficult to select the optimal segment.
Furthermore, they heavily depend on the use of LLMs which require expensive
inferences. To address these limitations, we propose a \textit{TAG}, a simple
yet effective Temporal-Aware approach for zero-shot video temporal Grounding,
which incorporates temporal pooling, temporal coherence clustering, and
similarity adjustment. Our proposed method effectively captures the temporal
context of videos and addresses distorted similarity distributions without
training. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on Charades-STA and
ActivityNet Captions benchmark datasets without rely on LLMs. Our code is

Abstract: Advancement of machine learning techniques, combined with the availability of
large-scale datasets, has significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of
facial recognition. Modern facial recognition systems are trained using large
face datasets collected from diverse individuals or public repositories.
However, for training, these datasets are often replicated and stored in
multiple workstations, resulting in data replication, which complicates
database management and oversight. Currently, once a user submits their face
for dataset preparation, they lose control over how their data is used, raising
significant privacy and ethical concerns. This paper introduces VOIDFace, a
novel framework for facial recognition systems that addresses two major issues.
First, it eliminates the need of data replication and improves data control to
securely store training face data by using visual secret sharing. Second, it
proposes a patch-based multi-training network that uses this novel training
data storage mechanism to develop a robust, privacy-preserving facial
recognition system. By integrating these advancements, VOIDFace aims to improve
the privacy, security, and efficiency of facial recognition training, while
ensuring greater control over sensitive personal face data. VOIDFace also
enables users to exercise their Right-To-Be-Forgotten property to control their
personal data. Experimental evaluations on the VGGFace2 dataset show that
VOIDFace provides Right-To-Be-Forgotten, improved data control, security, and
privacy while maintaining competitive facial recognition performance. Code is

Abstract: Providing intelligent support to surgical teams is a key frontier in
automated surgical scene understanding, with the long-term goal of improving
patient outcomes. Developing personalized intelligence for all staff members
requires maintaining a consistent state of who is located where for long
surgical procedures, which still poses numerous computational challenges. We
propose TrackOR, a framework for tackling long-term multi-person tracking and
re-identification in the operating room. TrackOR uses 3D geometric signatures
to achieve state-of-the-art online tracking performance (+11% Association
Accuracy over the strongest baseline), while also enabling an effective offline
recovery process to create analysis-ready trajectories. Our work shows that by
leveraging 3D geometric information, persistent identity tracking becomes
attainable, enabling a critical shift towards the more granular, staff-centric
analyses required for personalized intelligent systems in the operating room.
This new capability opens up various applications, including our proposed
temporal pathway imprints that translate raw tracking data into actionable
insights for improving team efficiency and safety and ultimately providing
personalized support.

Motivation: 当前VFX生成方法受限于单效果训练，无法满足多效果空间控制的需求。

Method: 提出LoRA-MoE和SAP技术，结合IIF模块，实现多效果集成和精确空间控制。

Result: 实验表明，Omni-Effects能精确控制效果类别和位置，生成多样化效果。

Conclusion: Omni-Effects为多VFX生成提供了高效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) are essential visual enhancements fundamental to modern
cinematic production. Although video generation models offer cost-efficient
solutions for VFX production, current methods are constrained by per-effect
LoRA training, which limits generation to single effects. This fundamental
limitation impedes applications that require spatially controllable composite
effects, i.e., the concurrent generation of multiple effects at designated
locations. However, integrating diverse effects into a unified framework faces
major challenges: interference from effect variations and spatial
uncontrollability during multi-VFX joint training. To tackle these challenges,
we propose Omni-Effects, a first unified framework capable of generating
prompt-guided effects and spatially controllable composite effects. The core of
our framework comprises two key innovations: (1) LoRA-based Mixture of Experts
(LoRA-MoE), which employs a group of expert LoRAs, integrating diverse effects
within a unified model while effectively mitigating cross-task interference.
(2) Spatial-Aware Prompt (SAP) incorporates spatial mask information into the
text token, enabling precise spatial control. Furthermore, we introduce an
Independent-Information Flow (IIF) module integrated within the SAP, isolating
the control signals corresponding to individual effects to prevent any unwanted
blending. To facilitate this research, we construct a comprehensive VFX dataset
Omni-VFX via a novel data collection pipeline combining image editing and
First-Last Frame-to-Video (FLF2V) synthesis, and introduce a dedicated VFX
evaluation framework for validating model performance. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Omni-Effects achieves precise spatial control and diverse
effect generation, enabling users to specify both the category and location of
desired effects.

Motivation: MLLMs作为辅助技术对BVI社区有巨大潜力，但当前模型在动态环境中的表现存在严重缺陷，影响用户信任。

Method: 通过分析‘电梯问题’这一典型案例，指出现有视频理解框架（基于离散帧采样）难以捕捉连续低信号运动。

Result: 揭示了‘隐式运动盲区’问题，并分析了其对用户信任的负面影响。

Conclusion: 呼吁从语义识别转向物理感知，开发以人为中心的新基准，确保动态环境中的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold immense promise as assistive
technologies for the blind and visually impaired (BVI) community. However, we
identify a critical failure mode that undermines their trustworthiness in
real-world applications. We introduce the Escalator Problem -- the inability of
state-of-the-art models to perceive an escalator's direction of travel -- as a
canonical example of a deeper limitation we term Implicit Motion Blindness.
This blindness stems from the dominant frame-sampling paradigm in video
understanding, which, by treating videos as discrete sequences of static
images, fundamentally struggles to perceive continuous, low-signal motion. As a
position paper, our contribution is not a new model but rather to: (I) formally
articulate this blind spot, (II) analyze its implications for user trust, and
(III) issue a call to action. We advocate for a paradigm shift from purely
semantic recognition towards robust physical perception and urge the
development of new, human-centered benchmarks that prioritize safety,
reliability, and the genuine needs of users in dynamic environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PrIINeR是一种基于隐式神经表示（INR）的MRI重建方法，通过整合预训练深度学习模型的先验知识，显著提升了高加速因子下的图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加速MRI扫描会降低图像质量，现有INR方法在高加速因子下因先验约束不足导致结构丢失和伪影。

Method: PrIINeR将群体级先验知识与实例优化结合，并强制执行双重数据一致性，以同时符合k空间数据和先验重建。

Result: 在NYU fastMRI数据集上，PrIINeR不仅优于现有INR方法，还超越多种学习型先进方法，显著提升结构保留和保真度，有效消除伪影。

Conclusion: PrIINeR结合深度学习和INR技术，为高质量加速MRI重建提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Accelerating Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reduces scan time but often
degrades image quality. While Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) show
promise for MRI reconstruction, they struggle at high acceleration factors due
to weak prior constraints, leading to structural loss and aliasing artefacts.
To address this, we propose PrIINeR, an INR-based MRI reconstruction method
that integrates prior knowledge from pre-trained deep learning models into the
INR framework. By combining population-level knowledge with instance-based
optimization and enforcing dual data consistency, PrIINeR aligns both with the
acquired k-space data and the prior-informed reconstruction. Evaluated on the
NYU fastMRI dataset, our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art INR-based
approaches but also improves upon several learning-based state-of-the-art
methods, significantly improving structural preservation and fidelity while
effectively removing aliasing artefacts.PrIINeR bridges deep learning and
INR-based techniques, offering a more reliable solution for high-quality,
accelerated MRI reconstruction. The code is publicly available on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProGraD是一种通过可学习的群体提示和轻量级GroupContext Transformer改进Vision Foundation Models（VFMs）在群体活动检测（GAD）中表现的方法，尤其在多群体场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VFMs（如DinoV2）虽在对象中心数据上表现优秀，但在群体动态建模中未充分探索，且直接替换CNN骨干网络效果有限，需结构化群体感知推理。

Method: ProGraD结合1）可学习的群体提示引导VFM关注社会配置，2）轻量级GroupContext Transformer推断演员-群体关联和集体行为。

Result: 在Cafe和Social-CAD基准测试中表现优于现有方法，多群体场景中Group mAP@1.0和Group mAP@0.5分别提升6.5%和8.2%。

Conclusion: ProGraD不仅性能优越，还生成可解释的注意力图，为群体推理提供洞察，代码和模型将开源。

Abstract: Group Activity Detection (GAD) involves recognizing social groups and their
collective behaviors in videos. Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), like DinoV2,
offer excellent features, but are pretrained primarily on object-centric data
and remain underexplored for modeling group dynamics. While they are a
promising alternative to highly task-specific GAD architectures that require
full fine-tuning, our initial investigation reveals that simply swapping CNN
backbones used in these methods with VFMs brings little gain, underscoring the
need for structured, group-aware reasoning on top.
  We introduce Prompt-driven Group Activity Detection (ProGraD) -- a method
that bridges this gap through 1) learnable group prompts to guide the VFM
attention toward social configurations, and 2) a lightweight two-layer
GroupContext Transformer that infers actor-group associations and collective
behavior. We evaluate our approach on two recent GAD benchmarks: Cafe, which
features multiple concurrent social groups, and Social-CAD, which focuses on
single-group interactions. While we surpass state-of-the-art in both settings,
our method is especially effective in complex multi-group scenarios, where we
yield a gain of 6.5\% (Group mAP\@1.0) and 8.2\% (Group mAP\@0.5) using only
10M trainable parameters. Furthermore, our experiments reveal that ProGraD
produces interpretable attention maps, offering insights into actor-group
reasoning. Code and models will be released.

TL;DR: SRA是一种无需搜索的自动数据增强方法，通过动态调整增强策略和启发式评分模块，显著提升了性能，并在ImageNet上达到78.31%的Top-1准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流AutoDA方法存在搜索耗时或性能不足的问题，SRA旨在解决这些问题。

Method: SRA采用启发式评分模块和不对称增强策略，动态调整增强策略。

Result: SRA在ImageNet上达到78.31%的Top-1准确率，并在下游任务中表现良好。

Conclusion: SRA是一种简单、高效且实用的AutoDA方法，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Automatic data augmentation (AutoDA) plays an important role in enhancing the
generalization of neural networks. However, mainstream AutoDA methods often
encounter two challenges: either the search process is excessively
time-consuming, hindering practical application, or the performance is
suboptimal due to insufficient policy adaptation during training. To address
these issues, we propose Sample-aware RandAugment (SRA), an asymmetric,
search-free AutoDA method that dynamically adjusts augmentation policies while
maintaining straightforward implementation. SRA incorporates a heuristic
scoring module that evaluates the complexity of the original training data,
enabling the application of tailored augmentations for each sample.
Additionally, an asymmetric augmentation strategy is employed to maximize the
potential of this scoring module. In multiple experimental settings, SRA
narrows the performance gap between search-based and search-free AutoDA
methods, achieving a state-of-the-art Top-1 accuracy of 78.31\% on ImageNet
with ResNet-50. Notably, SRA demonstrates good compatibility with existing
augmentation pipelines and solid generalization across new tasks, without
requiring hyperparameter tuning. The pretrained models leveraging SRA also
enhance recognition in downstream object detection tasks. SRA represents a
promising step towards simpler, more effective, and practical AutoDA designs
applicable to a variety of future tasks. Our code is available at

Conclusion: MDD-Net在多模态抑郁症检测中表现出色，性能显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Depression is a major mental health condition that severely impacts the
emotional and physical well-being of individuals. The simple nature of data
collection from social media platforms has attracted significant interest in
properly utilizing this information for mental health research. A Multimodal
Depression Detection Network (MDD-Net), utilizing acoustic and visual data
obtained from social media networks, is proposed in this work where mutual
transformers are exploited to efficiently extract and fuse multimodal features
for efficient depression detection. The MDD-Net consists of four core modules:
an acoustic feature extraction module for retrieving relevant acoustic
attributes, a visual feature extraction module for extracting significant
high-level patterns, a mutual transformer for computing the correlations among
the generated features and fusing these features from multiple modalities, and
a detection layer for detecting depression using the fused feature
representations. The extensive experiments are performed using the multimodal
D-Vlog dataset, and the findings reveal that the developed multimodal
depression detection network surpasses the state-of-the-art by up to 17.37% for
F1-Score, demonstrating the greater performance of the proposed system. The

<details>

Motivation: 手术室中标准化服装掩盖了识别特征，导致模型依赖无关视觉线索（如鞋子或眼镜），影响任务准确性。

Method: 通过梯度显著性分析揭示CNN模型的偏差，并提出使用3D点云序列编码人员特征，分离形状和运动模式。

Result: 实验显示，RGB模型在临床环境中性能下降12%，而几何方法表现更稳定。

Conclusion: 几何表示能捕捉更有意义的生物特征，为手术室中的人类建模提供了更鲁棒的方法。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are prone to learning spurious correlations, exploiting
dataset-specific artifacts rather than meaningful features for prediction. In
surgical operating rooms (OR), these manifest through the standardization of
smocks and gowns that obscure robust identifying landmarks, introducing model
bias for tasks related to modeling OR personnel. Through gradient-based
saliency analysis on two public OR datasets, we reveal that CNN models succumb
to such shortcuts, fixating on incidental visual cues such as footwear beneath
surgical gowns, distinctive eyewear, or other role-specific identifiers.
Avoiding such biases is essential for the next generation of intelligent
assistance systems in the OR, which should accurately recognize personalized
workflow traits, such as surgical skill level or coordination with other staff
members. We address this problem by encoding personnel as 3D point cloud
sequences, disentangling identity-relevant shape and motion patterns from
appearance-based confounders. Our experiments demonstrate that while RGB and
geometric methods achieve comparable performance on datasets with apparent
simulation artifacts, RGB models suffer a 12% accuracy drop in realistic
clinical settings with decreased visual diversity due to standardizations. This
performance gap confirms that geometric representations capture more meaningful
biometric features, providing an avenue to developing robust methods of
modeling humans in the OR.

Motivation: 现有雷达-相机融合算法未考虑天气条件对传感器性能的影响，且语言描述在多模态深度估计中的应用尚未充分探索。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，MAE和RMSE分别提升12.87%和9.08%。

Conclusion: TRIDE通过多模态融合和天气适应性设计，显著提升了深度估计的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Depth estimation, essential for autonomous driving, seeks to interpret the 3D
environment surrounding vehicles. The development of radar sensors, known for
their cost-efficiency and robustness, has spurred interest in radar-camera
fusion-based solutions. However, existing algorithms fuse features from these
modalities without accounting for weather conditions, despite radars being
known to be more robust than cameras under adverse weather. Additionally, while
Vision-Language models have seen rapid advancement, utilizing language
descriptions alongside other modalities for depth estimation remains an open
challenge. This paper first introduces a text-generation strategy along with
feature extraction and fusion techniques that can assist monocular depth
estimation pipelines, leading to improved accuracy across different algorithms
on the KITTI dataset. Building on this, we propose TRIDE, a radar-camera fusion
algorithm that enhances text feature extraction by incorporating radar point
information. To address the impact of weather on sensor performance, we
introduce a weather-aware fusion block that adaptively adjusts radar weighting
based on current weather conditions. Our method, benchmarked on the nuScenes
dataset, demonstrates performance gains over the state-of-the-art, achieving a
12.87% improvement in MAE and a 9.08% improvement in RMSE. Code:

Conclusion: 该方法为生成高质量3D视频提供了一种高效且无需额外训练的解决方案。

Abstract: While video generation models excel at producing high-quality monocular
videos, generating 3D stereoscopic and spatial videos for immersive
applications remains an underexplored challenge. We present a pose-free and
training-free method that leverages an off-the-shelf monocular video generation
model to produce immersive 3D videos. Our approach first warps the generated
monocular video into pre-defined camera viewpoints using estimated depth
information, then applies a novel \textit{frame matrix} inpainting framework.
This framework utilizes the original video generation model to synthesize
missing content across different viewpoints and timestamps, ensuring spatial
and temporal consistency without requiring additional model fine-tuning.
Moreover, we develop a \dualupdate~scheme that further improves the quality of
video inpainting by alleviating the negative effects propagated from
disoccluded areas in the latent space. The resulting multi-view videos are then
adapted into stereoscopic pairs or optimized into 4D Gaussians for spatial
video synthesis. We validate the efficacy of our proposed method by conducting
experiments on videos from various generative models, such as Sora, Lumiere,
WALT, and Zeroscope. The experiments demonstrate that our method has a
significant improvement over previous methods. Project page at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于预训练模型的类增量学习方法通常冻结预训练网络，并使用轻量级模块（如适配器）适应增量任务，但模块选择错误和任务特定模块忽视共享知识导致性能下降。

Method: 提出TUNA方法，训练任务特定适配器捕获关键特征，并引入基于熵的选择机制；同时通过适配器融合构建通用适配器，编码跨任务共享的判别性特征。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: TUNA方法通过结合任务特定和通用适配器，有效提升了类增量学习的性能。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires a learning system to continually
learn new classes without forgetting. Existing pre-trained model-based CIL
methods often freeze the pre-trained network and adapt to incremental tasks
using additional lightweight modules such as adapters. However, incorrect
module selection during inference hurts performance, and task-specific modules
often overlook shared general knowledge, leading to errors on distinguishing
between similar classes across tasks. To address the aforementioned challenges,
we propose integrating Task-Specific and Universal Adapters (TUNA) in this
paper. Specifically, we train task-specific adapters to capture the most
crucial features relevant to their respective tasks and introduce an
entropy-based selection mechanism to choose the most suitable adapter.
Furthermore, we leverage an adapter fusion strategy to construct a universal
adapter, which encodes the most discriminative features shared across tasks. We
combine task-specific and universal adapter predictions to harness both
specialized and general knowledge during inference. Extensive experiments on
various benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our
approach. Code is available at: https://github.com/LAMDA-CL/ICCV2025-TUNA

Motivation: 当前方法在医学图像多标签分类中难以区分因果和无关特征，导致诊断准确性受限。

Method: 提出结构因果模型（SCM）和IBCA，结合高斯混合多标签空间注意力和对比增强因果干预，过滤无关信息并增强因果注意力。

Result: 在Endo和MuReD数据集上，IBCA在多项指标上显著优于其他方法，如CR、OR和mAP等。

Conclusion: IBCA能有效提升医学图像多标签分类的准确性和可解释性，具有临床潜力。

Abstract: Multi-label classification (MLC) of medical images aims to identify multiple
diseases and holds significant clinical potential. A critical step is to learn
class-specific features for accurate diagnosis and improved interpretability
effectively. However, current works focus primarily on causal attention to
learn class-specific features, yet they struggle to interpret the true cause
due to the inadvertent attention to class-irrelevant features. To address this
challenge, we propose a new structural causal model (SCM) that treats
class-specific attention as a mixture of causal, spurious, and noisy factors,
and a novel Information Bottleneck-based Causal Attention (IBCA) that is
capable of learning the discriminative class-specific attention for MLC of
medical images. Specifically, we propose learning Gaussian mixture multi-label
spatial attention to filter out class-irrelevant information and capture each
class-specific attention pattern. Then a contrastive enhancement-based causal
intervention is proposed to gradually mitigate the spurious attention and
reduce noise information by aligning multi-head attention with the Gaussian
mixture multi-label spatial. Quantitative and ablation results on Endo and
MuReD show that IBCA outperforms all methods. Compared to the second-best
results for each metric, IBCA achieves improvements of 6.35\% in CR, 7.72\% in
OR, and 5.02\% in mAP for MuReD, 1.47\% in CR, and 1.65\% in CF1, and 1.42\% in

Conclusion: 通过状态空间模型和任务协同策略，论文有效解决了ME分析中的时序动态和任务关联问题，显著提升了分析效果。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are regarded as important indicators of an
individual's intrinsic emotions, preferences, and tendencies. ME analysis
requires spotting of ME intervals within long video sequences and recognition
of their corresponding emotional categories. Previous deep learning approaches
commonly employ sliding-window classification networks. However, the use of
fixed window lengths and hard classification presents notable limitations in
practice. Furthermore, these methods typically treat ME spotting and
recognition as two separate tasks, overlooking the essential relationship
between them. To address these challenges, this paper proposes two state space
model-based architectures, namely ME-TST and ME-TST+, which utilize temporal
state transition mechanisms to replace conventional window-level classification
with video-level regression. This enables a more precise characterization of
the temporal dynamics of MEs and supports the modeling of MEs with varying
durations. In ME-TST+, we further introduce multi-granularity ROI modeling and
the slowfast Mamba framework to alleviate information loss associated with
treating ME analysis as a time-series task. Additionally, we propose a synergy
strategy for spotting and recognition at both the feature and result levels,
leveraging their intrinsic connection to enhance overall analysis performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve
state-of-the-art performance. The codes are available at

Abstract: Explorable 3D world generation from a single image or text prompt forms a
cornerstone of spatial intelligence. Recent works utilize video model to
achieve wide-scope and generalizable 3D world generation. However, existing
approaches often suffer from a limited scope in the generated scenes. In this
work, we propose Matrix-3D, a framework that utilize panoramic representation
for wide-coverage omnidirectional explorable 3D world generation that combines
conditional video generation and panoramic 3D reconstruction. We first train a
trajectory-guided panoramic video diffusion model that employs scene mesh
renders as condition, to enable high-quality and geometrically consistent scene
video generation. To lift the panorama scene video to 3D world, we propose two
separate methods: (1) a feed-forward large panorama reconstruction model for
rapid 3D scene reconstruction and (2) an optimization-based pipeline for
accurate and detailed 3D scene reconstruction. To facilitate effective
training, we also introduce the Matrix-Pano dataset, the first large-scale
synthetic collection comprising 116K high-quality static panoramic video
sequences with depth and trajectory annotations. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance
in panoramic video generation and 3D world generation. See more in

Result: 提取的3D根系骨架与真实结构高度相似，验证了模型的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法可应用于自动化育种机器人，提升育种效率，减少人工干预，推动现代农业发展。

Abstract: Plant roots typically exhibit a highly complex and dense architecture,
incorporating numerous slender lateral roots and branches, which significantly
hinders the precise capture and modeling of the entire root system.
Additionally, roots often lack sufficient texture and color information, making
it difficult to identify and track root traits using visual methods. Previous
research on roots has been largely confined to 2D studies; however, exploring
the 3D architecture of roots is crucial in botany. Since roots grow in real 3D
space, 3D phenotypic information is more critical for studying genetic traits
and their impact on root development. We have introduced a 3D root skeleton
extraction method that efficiently derives the 3D architecture of plant roots
from a few images. This method includes the detection and matching of lateral
roots, triangulation to extract the skeletal structure of lateral roots, and
the integration of lateral and primary roots. We developed a highly complex
root dataset and tested our method on it. The extracted 3D root skeletons
showed considerable similarity to the ground truth, validating the
effectiveness of the model. This method can play a significant role in
automated breeding robots. Through precise 3D root structure analysis, breeding
robots can better identify plant phenotypic traits, especially root structure
and growth patterns, helping practitioners select seeds with superior root
systems. This automated approach not only improves breeding efficiency but also
reduces manual intervention, making the breeding process more intelligent and
efficient, thus advancing modern agriculture.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型统一方法存在两个主要问题：一是仅使用MLLM的最终隐藏状态作为生成条件，导致生成器与MLLM中间层的丰富表示隔离；二是从头预训练统一生成架构计算成本高。

Conclusion: 该方法为多模态理解与生成提供了一种高效且性能优越的新范式。

Abstract: This paper introduces TBAC-UniImage, a novel unified model for multimodal
understanding and generation. We achieve this by deeply integrating a
pre-trained Diffusion Model, acting as a generative ladder, with a Multimodal
Large Language Model (MLLM). Previous diffusion-based unified models face two
primary limitations. One approach uses only the MLLM's final hidden state as
the generative condition. This creates a shallow connection, as the generator
is isolated from the rich, hierarchical representations within the MLLM's
intermediate layers. The other approach, pretraining a unified generative
architecture from scratch, is computationally expensive and prohibitive for
many researchers. To overcome these issues, our work explores a new paradigm.
Instead of relying on a single output, we use representations from multiple,
diverse layers of the MLLM as generative conditions for the diffusion model.
This method treats the pre-trained generator as a ladder, receiving guidance
from various depths of the MLLM's understanding process. Consequently,
TBAC-UniImage achieves a much deeper and more fine-grained unification of
understanding and generation.

simultaneously captures spatial and spectral information, enabling
non-invasive, label-free analysis of material, chemical, and biological
properties. This Primer presents a comprehensive overview of HSI, from the
underlying physical principles and sensor architectures to key steps in data
acquisition, calibration, and correction. We summarize common data structures
and highlight classical and modern analysis methods, including dimensionality
reduction, classification, spectral unmixing, and AI-driven techniques such as

complexity of high-dimensional data, are examined alongside emerging solutions,
including computational imaging, physics-informed modeling, cross-modal fusion,
and self-supervised learning. Best practices for dataset sharing,
reproducibility, and metadata documentation are further highlighted to support
transparency and reuse. Looking ahead, we explore future directions toward
scalable, real-time, and embedded HSI systems, driven by sensor
miniaturization, self-supervised learning, and foundation models. As HSI
evolves into a general-purpose, cross-disciplinary platform, it holds promise
for transformative applications in science, technology, and society.

TL;DR: GRASPTrack是一种新颖的深度感知多目标跟踪框架，通过结合单目深度估计和实例分割，解决了传统跟踪方法在遮挡和深度模糊问题上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于检测的跟踪方法因缺乏几何感知能力，难以解决遮挡和深度模糊问题。

Method: GRASPTrack将单目深度估计和实例分割整合到标准跟踪流程中，生成3D点云，并通过体素化实现精确的空间关联。此外，采用深度感知自适应噪声补偿和深度增强的运动一致性方法。

Result: 在MOT17、MOT20和DanceTrack基准测试中表现优异，显著提升了复杂场景下的跟踪鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GRASPTrack通过3D几何推理和动态噪声补偿，有效提升了多目标跟踪在复杂场景中的性能。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in monocular videos is fundamentally challenged
by occlusions and depth ambiguity, issues that conventional
tracking-by-detection (TBD) methods struggle to resolve owing to a lack of
geometric awareness. To address these limitations, we introduce GRASPTrack, a
novel depth-aware MOT framework that integrates monocular depth estimation and
instance segmentation into a standard TBD pipeline to generate high-fidelity 3D
point clouds from 2D detections, thereby enabling explicit 3D geometric
reasoning. These 3D point clouds are then voxelized to enable a precise and
robust Voxel-Based 3D Intersection-over-Union (IoU) for spatial association. To
further enhance tracking robustness, our approach incorporates Depth-aware
Adaptive Noise Compensation, which dynamically adjusts the Kalman filter
process noise based on occlusion severity for more reliable state estimation.
Additionally, we propose a Depth-enhanced Observation-Centric Momentum, which
extends the motion direction consistency from the image plane into 3D space to
improve motion-based association cues, particularly for objects with complex
trajectories. Extensive experiments on the MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance,
significantly improving tracking robustness in complex scenes with frequent
occlusions and intricate motion patterns.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需训练和掩码的图像编辑框架Follow-Your-Shape，通过轨迹差异图（TDM）和KV注入机制实现精确的形状编辑，并引入新基准ReShapeBench验证其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流式图像编辑模型在大规模形状变换任务中表现不佳，容易影响非目标区域。

Method: 提出TDM定位可编辑区域，结合Scheduled KV Injection机制实现稳定编辑。

Result: 实验表明该方法在形状替换任务中具有优越的编辑能力和视觉保真度。

Conclusion: Follow-Your-Shape是一种高效且可控的形状编辑框架，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: While recent flow-based image editing models demonstrate general-purpose
capabilities across diverse tasks, they often struggle to specialize in
challenging scenarios -- particularly those involving large-scale shape
transformations. When performing such structural edits, these methods either
fail to achieve the intended shape change or inadvertently alter non-target
regions, resulting in degraded background quality. We propose
Follow-Your-Shape, a training-free and mask-free framework that supports
precise and controllable editing of object shapes while strictly preserving
non-target content. Motivated by the divergence between inversion and editing
trajectories, we compute a Trajectory Divergence Map (TDM) by comparing
token-wise velocity differences between the inversion and denoising paths. The
TDM enables precise localization of editable regions and guides a Scheduled KV
Injection mechanism that ensures stable and faithful editing. To facilitate a
rigorous evaluation, we introduce ReShapeBench, a new benchmark comprising 120
new images and enriched prompt pairs specifically curated for shape-aware
editing. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior editability
and visual fidelity, particularly in tasks requiring large-scale shape
replacement.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种场景和风格下均优于现有技术，实现了更高的风格化质量和视觉真实感。

Conclusion: FantasyStyle通过创新方法有效解决了3D风格迁移中的关键挑战，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: The success of 3DGS in generative and editing applications has sparked
growing interest in 3DGS-based style transfer. However, current methods still
face two major challenges: (1) multi-view inconsistency often leads to style
conflicts, resulting in appearance smoothing and distortion; and (2) heavy
reliance on VGG features, which struggle to disentangle style and content from
style images, often causing content leakage and excessive stylization. To
tackle these issues, we introduce \textbf{FantasyStyle}, a 3DGS-based style
transfer framework, and the first to rely entirely on diffusion model
distillation. It comprises two key components: (1) \textbf{Multi-View Frequency
Consistency}. We enhance cross-view consistency by applying a 3D filter to
multi-view noisy latent, selectively reducing low-frequency components to
mitigate stylized prior conflicts. (2) \textbf{Controllable Stylized
Distillation}. To suppress content leakage from style images, we introduce
negative guidance to exclude undesired content. In addition, we identify the
limitations of Score Distillation Sampling and Delta Denoising Score in 3D
style transfer and remove the reconstruction term accordingly. Building on
these insights, we propose a controllable stylized distillation that leverages
negative guidance to more effectively optimize the 3D Gaussians. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches, achieving higher stylization quality and visual
realism across various scenes and styles.

Motivation: 现有仿真环境与现实条件差异大，且受限于训练数据分布，难以生成高质量传感器数据。

Method: 结合视频扩散先验和运动学模型构建ReconSimulator，引入动态对抗代理（DAA）和轨迹生成器（CTG）生成极端场景。

Result: 实验显示ReconDreamer-RL优于模仿学习方法，碰撞率降低5倍。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升端到端自动驾驶训练性能，缩小模拟与现实差距。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning for training end-to-end autonomous driving models in
closed-loop simulations is gaining growing attention. However, most simulation
environments differ significantly from real-world conditions, creating a
substantial simulation-to-reality (sim2real) gap. To bridge this gap, some
approaches utilize scene reconstruction techniques to create photorealistic
environments as a simulator. While this improves realistic sensor simulation,
these methods are inherently constrained by the distribution of the training
data, making it difficult to render high-quality sensor data for novel
trajectories or corner case scenarios. Therefore, we propose ReconDreamer-RL, a
framework designed to integrate video diffusion priors into scene
reconstruction to aid reinforcement learning, thereby enhancing end-to-end
autonomous driving training. Specifically, in ReconDreamer-RL, we introduce
ReconSimulator, which combines the video diffusion prior for appearance
modeling and incorporates a kinematic model for physical modeling, thereby
reconstructing driving scenarios from real-world data. This narrows the
sim2real gap for closed-loop evaluation and reinforcement learning. To cover
more corner-case scenarios, we introduce the Dynamic Adversary Agent (DAA),
which adjusts the trajectories of surrounding vehicles relative to the ego
vehicle, autonomously generating corner-case traffic scenarios (e.g., cut-in).
Finally, the Cousin Trajectory Generator (CTG) is proposed to address the issue
of training data distribution, which is often biased toward simple
straight-line movements. Experiments show that ReconDreamer-RL improves
end-to-end autonomous driving training, outperforming imitation learning
methods with a 5x reduction in the Collision Ratio.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模科学模拟生成高分辨率时变数据（TVD）成本高，现有超分辨率方法依赖大量高分辨率训练数据，限制了其适用性。

Method: CD-TVD结合对比学习编码器和改进的扩散模型（含局部注意力机制），通过预训练学习降级模式，仅需一个高分辨率时间步进行微调。

Result: 在流体和大气模拟数据集上，CD-TVD实现了准确且资源高效的3D超分辨率。

Conclusion: CD-TVD显著提升了大规模科学模拟的数据增强能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large-scale scientific simulations require significant resources to generate
high-resolution time-varying data (TVD). While super-resolution is an efficient
post-processing strategy to reduce costs, existing methods rely on a large
amount of HR training data, limiting their applicability to diverse simulation
scenarios. To address this constraint, we proposed CD-TVD, a novel framework
that combines contrastive learning and an improved diffusion-based
super-resolution model to achieve accurate 3D super-resolution from limited
time-step high-resolution data. During pre-training on historical simulation
data, the contrastive encoder and diffusion superresolution modules learn
degradation patterns and detailed features of high-resolution and
low-resolution samples. In the training phase, the improved diffusion model
with a local attention mechanism is fine-tuned using only one newly generated
high-resolution timestep, leveraging the degradation knowledge learned by the
encoder. This design minimizes the reliance on large-scale high-resolution
datasets while maintaining the capability to recover fine-grained details.
Experimental results on fluid and atmospheric simulation datasets confirm that
CD-TVD delivers accurate and resource-efficient 3D super-resolution, marking a
significant advancement in data augmentation for large-scale scientific
simulations. The code is available at

Motivation: 当前医学图像定位方法依赖显式空间提示，无法处理临床实践中的隐式查询，亟需一种结合临床推理和像素级定位的新方法。

Method: 定义了UMRG任务，构建了U-MRG-14K数据集，并设计了MedReasoner框架，分离推理与分割模块，通过强化学习优化推理器。

Result: MedReasoner在U-MRG-14K数据集上表现最优，并能泛化到未见过的临床查询。

Conclusion: 强化学习在可解释的医学图像定位中具有显著潜力。

Abstract: Accurately grounding regions of interest (ROIs) is critical for diagnosis and
treatment planning in medical imaging. While multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) combine visual perception with natural language, current
medical-grounding pipelines still rely on supervised fine-tuning with explicit
spatial hints, making them ill-equipped to handle the implicit queries common
in clinical practice. This work makes three core contributions. We first define
Unified Medical Reasoning Grounding (UMRG), a novel vision-language task that
demands clinical reasoning and pixel-level grounding. Second, we release
U-MRG-14K, a dataset of 14K samples featuring pixel-level masks alongside
implicit clinical queries and reasoning traces, spanning 10 modalities, 15
super-categories, and 108 specific categories. Finally, we introduce
MedReasoner, a modular framework that distinctly separates reasoning from
segmentation: an MLLM reasoner is optimized with reinforcement learning, while
a frozen segmentation expert converts spatial prompts into masks, with
alignment achieved through format and accuracy rewards. MedReasoner achieves
state-of-the-art performance on U-MRG-14K and demonstrates strong
generalization to unseen clinical queries, underscoring the significant promise
of reinforcement learning for interpretable medical grounding.

Method: 利用MoCap数据集生成虚拟单视角深度数据，训练掩码自编码器完成部分网格，推理时匹配深度数据恢复完整网格。

Result: 在SURREAL、CAPE和BEHAVE数据集上表现优异，PVE分别为16.8 mm、22.0 mm和70.9 mm，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: M$^3$方法有效利用深度数据提升3D人体网格估计精度，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in 3D human mesh estimation from RGB images;
RGBD cameras, offering additional depth data, remain underutilized. In this
paper, we present a method for accurate 3D human mesh estimation from a single
RGBD view, leveraging the affordability and widespread adoption of RGBD cameras
for real-world applications. A fully supervised approach for this problem,
requires a dataset with RGBD image and 3D mesh label pairs. However, collecting
such a dataset is costly and challenging, hence, existing datasets are small,
and limited in pose and shape diversity. To overcome this data scarcity, we
leverage existing Motion Capture (MoCap) datasets. We first obtain complete 3D
meshes from the body models found in MoCap datasets, and create partial,
single-view versions of them by projection to a virtual camera. This simulates
the depth data provided by an RGBD camera from a single viewpoint. Then, we
train a masked autoencoder to complete the partial, single-view mesh. During
inference, our method, which we name as M$^3$ for ``Masked Mesh Modeling'',
matches the depth values coming from the sensor to vertices of a template human
mesh, which creates a partial, single-view mesh. We effectively recover parts
of the 3D human body mesh model that are not visible, resulting in a full body
mesh. M$^3$ achieves 16.8 mm and 22.0 mm per-vertex-error (PVE) on the SURREAL
and CAPE datasets, respectively; outperforming existing methods that use
full-body point clouds as input. We obtain a competitive 70.9 PVE on the BEHAVE
dataset, outperforming a recently published RGB based method by 18.4 mm,
highlighting the usefulness of depth data. Code will be released.

Motivation: 现有Transformer方法在超光谱图像融合中存在令牌冗余和多尺度特征建模不足的问题，且难以保留高频细节。

Method: THAT框架引入了Pivotal Token Selective Attention（PTSA）和Multi-level Variance-aware Feed-forward Network（MVFN），分别用于令牌选择和增强高频细节学习。

Result: 实验表明，THAT在标准基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，提升了重建质量和效率。

Conclusion: THAT通过改进令牌选择和高频细节学习，显著提升了超光谱图像融合的效果。

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have demonstrated strong potential in hyperspectral
pansharpening by modeling long-range dependencies. However, their effectiveness
is often limited by redundant token representations and a lack of multi-scale
feature modeling. Hyperspectral images exhibit intrinsic spectral priors (e.g.,
abundance sparsity) and spatial priors (e.g., non-local similarity), which are
critical for accurate reconstruction. From a spectral-spatial perspective,
Vision Transformers (ViTs) face two major limitations: they struggle to
preserve high-frequency components--such as material edges and texture
transitions--and suffer from attention dispersion across redundant tokens.
These issues stem from the global self-attention mechanism, which tends to
dilute high-frequency signals and overlook localized details. To address these
challenges, we propose the Token-wise High-frequency Augmentation Transformer
(THAT), a novel framework designed to enhance hyperspectral pansharpening
through improved high-frequency feature representation and token selection.
Specifically, THAT introduces: (1) Pivotal Token Selective Attention (PTSA) to
prioritize informative tokens and suppress redundancy; (2) a Multi-level
Variance-aware Feed-forward Network (MVFN) to enhance high-frequency detail
learning. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that THAT achieves
state-of-the-art performance with improved reconstruction quality and
efficiency. The source code is available at https://github.com/kailuo93/THAT.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of structural defects in civil infrastructure remains
challenging due to variable defect appearances, harsh imaging conditions, and
significant class imbalance. Current deep learning methods, despite their
effectiveness, typically require millions of parameters, rendering them
impractical for real-time inspection systems. We introduce KARMA
(Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Mapping Architecture), a highly efficient
semantic segmentation framework that models complex defect patterns through
compositions of one-dimensional functions rather than conventional
convolutions. KARMA features three technical innovations: (1) a
parameter-efficient Tiny Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (TiKAN) module leveraging
low-rank factorization for KAN-based feature transformation; (2) an optimized
feature pyramid structure with separable convolutions for multi-scale defect
analysis; and (3) a static-dynamic prototype mechanism that enhances feature
representation for imbalanced classes. Extensive experiments on benchmark
infrastructure inspection datasets demonstrate that KARMA achieves competitive
or superior mean IoU performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while
using significantly fewer parameters (0.959M vs. 31.04M, a 97% reduction).
Operating at 0.264 GFLOPS, KARMA maintains inference speeds suitable for
real-time deployment, enabling practical automated infrastructure inspection
systems without compromising accuracy. The source code can be accessed at the

Abstract: Recent advances at the intersection of reinforcement learning (RL) and visual
intelligence have enabled agents that not only perceive complex visual scenes
but also reason, generate, and act within them. This survey offers a critical
and up-to-date synthesis of the field. We first formalize visual RL problems
and trace the evolution of policy-optimization strategies from RLHF to
verifiable reward paradigms, and from Proximal Policy Optimization to Group
Relative Policy Optimization. We then organize more than 200 representative
works into four thematic pillars: multi-modal large language models, visual
generation, unified model frameworks, and vision-language-action models. For
each pillar we examine algorithmic design, reward engineering, benchmark
progress, and we distill trends such as curriculum-driven training,
preference-aligned diffusion, and unified reward modeling. Finally, we review
evaluation protocols spanning set-level fidelity, sample-level preference, and
state-level stability, and we identify open challenges that include sample
efficiency, generalization, and safe deployment. Our goal is to provide
researchers and practitioners with a coherent map of the rapidly expanding
landscape of visual RL and to highlight promising directions for future

Conclusion: Spatial-ORMLLM为手术室3D空间推理提供了高效解决方案，无需额外标注或传感器。

Abstract: Precise spatial modeling in the operating room (OR) is foundational to many
clinical tasks, supporting intraoperative awareness, hazard avoidance, and
surgical decision-making. While existing approaches leverage large-scale
multimodal datasets for latent-space alignment to implicitly learn spatial
relationships, they overlook the 3D capabilities of MLLMs. However, this
approach raises two issues: (1) Operating rooms typically lack multiple video
and audio sensors, making multimodal 3D data difficult to obtain; (2) Training
solely on readily available 2D data fails to capture fine-grained details in
complex scenes. To address this gap, we introduce Spatial-ORMLLM, the first
large vision-language model for 3D spatial reasoning in operating rooms using
only RGB modality to infer volumetric and semantic cues, enabling downstream
medical tasks with detailed and holistic spatial context. Spatial-ORMLLM
incorporates a Spatial-Enhanced Feature Fusion Block, which integrates 2D
modality inputs with rich 3D spatial knowledge extracted by the estimation
algorithm and then feeds the combined features into the visual tower. By
employing a unified end-to-end MLLM framework, it combines powerful spatial
features with textual features to deliver robust 3D scene reasoning without any
additional expert annotations or sensor inputs. Experiments on multiple
benchmark clinical datasets demonstrate that Spatial-ORMLLM achieves
state-of-the-art performance and generalizes robustly to previously unseen
surgical scenarios and downstream tasks.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for explicit
3D scene representation, yet achieving efficient and consistent 3D segmentation
remains challenging. Current methods suffer from prohibitive computational
costs, limited 3D spatial reasoning, and an inability to track multiple objects
simultaneously. We present Segment Any Gaussians Online (SAGOnline), a
lightweight and zero-shot framework for real-time 3D segmentation in Gaussian
scenes that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) a
decoupled strategy that integrates video foundation models (e.g., SAM2) for
view-consistent 2D mask propagation across synthesized views; and (2) a
GPU-accelerated 3D mask generation and Gaussian-level instance labeling
algorithm that assigns unique identifiers to 3D primitives, enabling lossless
multi-object tracking and segmentation across views. SAGOnline achieves
state-of-the-art performance on NVOS (92.7% mIoU) and Spin-NeRF (95.2% mIoU)
benchmarks, outperforming Feature3DGS, OmniSeg3D-gs, and SA3D by 15--1500 times
in inference speed (27 ms/frame). Qualitative results demonstrate robust
multi-object segmentation and tracking in complex scenes. Our contributions
include: (i) a lightweight and zero-shot framework for 3D segmentation in
Gaussian scenes, (ii) explicit labeling of Gaussian primitives enabling
simultaneous segmentation and tracking, and (iii) the effective adaptation of
2D video foundation models to the 3D domain. This work allows real-time
rendering and 3D scene understanding, paving the way for practical AR/VR and
robotic applications.

*Wenyi Mo,Ying Ba,Tianyu Zhang,Yalong Bai,Biye Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多模态大语言模型的方法，通过对比偏好损失和偏好标记学习个性化用户偏好，显著提高了预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖通用偏好或静态用户画像，忽略了用户偏好的动态性和多样性。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型，引入对比偏好损失和偏好标记，从历史交互中学习个性化偏好。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在偏好预测准确性上优于其他方法，并能识别相似审美倾向的用户。

Conclusion: 该方法能更精准地生成符合个人口味的图像，为个性化推荐提供了有效工具。

Abstract: User preference prediction requires a comprehensive and accurate
understanding of individual tastes. This includes both surface-level
attributes, such as color and style, and deeper content-related aspects, such
as themes and composition. However, existing methods typically rely on general
human preferences or assume static user profiles, often neglecting individual
variability and the dynamic, multifaceted nature of personal taste. To address
these limitations, we propose an approach built upon Multimodal Large Language
Models, introducing contrastive preference loss and preference tokens to learn
personalized user preferences from historical interactions. The contrastive
preference loss is designed to effectively distinguish between user ''likes''
and ''dislikes'', while the learnable preference tokens capture shared interest
representations among existing users, enabling the model to activate
group-specific preferences and enhance consistency across similar users.
Extensive experiments demonstrate our model outperforms other methods in
preference prediction accuracy, effectively identifying users with similar
aesthetic inclinations and providing more precise guidance for generating
images that align with individual tastes. The project page is

TL;DR: OMGSR提出了一种基于DDPM/FM生成模型的一步式真实图像超分辨率框架，通过在中时间步注入低质量图像潜在分布，减少分布差距，并优化生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有一步式真实图像超分辨率模型在初始时间步注入低质量图像潜在分布时，与高斯噪声潜在分布存在差距，限制了生成先验的有效利用。

Method: OMGSR在中时间步注入低质量图像潜在分布，引入潜在分布细化损失和重叠分块LPIPS/GAN损失，优化生成效果。

Result: OMGSR-S/F在512分辨率下表现优异，OMGSR-F在所有参考指标中占据主导地位，1k和2k分辨率下也取得出色结果。

Conclusion: OMGSR框架通过优化潜在分布对齐和生成损失，显著提升了一步式真实图像超分辨率的性能。

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and Flow Matching (FM)
generative models show promising potential for one-step Real-World Image
Super-Resolution (Real-ISR). Recent one-step Real-ISR models typically inject a
Low-Quality (LQ) image latent distribution at the initial timestep. However, a
fundamental gap exists between the LQ image latent distribution and the
Gaussian noisy latent distribution, limiting the effective utilization of
generative priors. We observe that the noisy latent distribution at DDPM/FM
mid-timesteps aligns more closely with the LQ image latent distribution. Based
on this insight, we present One Mid-timestep Guidance Real-ISR (OMGSR), a
universal framework applicable to DDPM/FM-based generative models. OMGSR
injects the LQ image latent distribution at a pre-computed mid-timestep,
incorporating the proposed Latent Distribution Refinement loss to alleviate the
latent distribution gap. We also design the Overlap-Chunked LPIPS/GAN loss to
eliminate checkerboard artifacts in image generation. Within this framework, we
instantiate OMGSR for DDPM/FM-based generative models with two variants:
OMGSR-S (SD-Turbo) and OMGSR-F (FLUX.1-dev). Experimental results demonstrate
that OMGSR-S/F achieves balanced/excellent performance across quantitative and
qualitative metrics at 512-resolution. Notably, OMGSR-F establishes
overwhelming dominance in all reference metrics. We further train a
1k-resolution OMGSR-F to match the default resolution of FLUX.1-dev, which
yields excellent results, especially in the details of the image generation. We
also generate 2k-resolution images by the 1k-resolution OMGSR-F using our
two-stage Tiled VAE & Diffusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出Next Shot Generation (NSG)框架Cut2Next，通过Diffusion Transformer和分层多提示策略生成符合专业编辑模式和电影连续性的高质量镜头。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多关注视觉一致性，忽视叙事编辑模式（如正反打镜头、切镜头），导致输出缺乏叙事复杂性和电影完整性。

Method: 采用Diffusion Transformer (DiT)，结合分层多提示策略（关系提示和个体提示），并通过Context-Aware Condition Injection (CACI)和Hierarchical Attention Mask (HAM)整合信号。

Result: Cut2Next在视觉一致性和文本保真度上表现优异，用户研究显示其更符合编辑模式和电影连续性。

Conclusion: Cut2Next能生成高质量、叙事表达丰富且电影连贯的后续镜头，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Effective multi-shot generation demands purposeful, film-like transitions and
strict cinematic continuity. Current methods, however, often prioritize basic
visual consistency, neglecting crucial editing patterns (e.g., shot/reverse
shot, cutaways) that drive narrative flow for compelling storytelling. This
yields outputs that may be visually coherent but lack narrative sophistication
and true cinematic integrity. To bridge this, we introduce Next Shot Generation
(NSG): synthesizing a subsequent, high-quality shot that critically conforms to
professional editing patterns while upholding rigorous cinematic continuity.
Our framework, Cut2Next, leverages a Diffusion Transformer (DiT). It employs
in-context tuning guided by a novel Hierarchical Multi-Prompting strategy. This
strategy uses Relational Prompts to define overall context and inter-shot
editing styles. Individual Prompts then specify per-shot content and
cinematographic attributes. Together, these guide Cut2Next to generate
cinematically appropriate next shots. Architectural innovations, Context-Aware
Condition Injection (CACI) and Hierarchical Attention Mask (HAM), further
integrate these diverse signals without introducing new parameters. We
construct RawCuts (large-scale) and CuratedCuts (refined) datasets, both with
hierarchical prompts, and introduce CutBench for evaluation. Experiments show
Cut2Next excels in visual consistency and text fidelity. Crucially, user
studies reveal a strong preference for Cut2Next, particularly for its adherence
to intended editing patterns and overall cinematic continuity, validating its
ability to generate high-quality, narratively expressive, and cinematically
coherent subsequent shots.

TL;DR: StableAvatar是一种端到端的视频扩散变换器，能够生成无限长度的高质量视频，解决了现有模型在音频同步和身份一致性上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频驱动的虚拟化身视频生成模型难以生成长视频且音频同步和身份一致性不足。

Method: 提出StableAvatar，结合定制训练和推理模块，引入时间步感知音频适配器和音频原生引导机制，以及动态加权滑动窗口策略。

Result: 实验证明StableAvatar在质量和定量上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: StableAvatar通过创新设计解决了长视频生成中的音频同步和一致性挑战。

Abstract: Current diffusion models for audio-driven avatar video generation struggle to
synthesize long videos with natural audio synchronization and identity
consistency. This paper presents StableAvatar, the first end-to-end video
diffusion transformer that synthesizes infinite-length high-quality videos
without post-processing. Conditioned on a reference image and audio,
StableAvatar integrates tailored training and inference modules to enable
infinite-length video generation. We observe that the main reason preventing
existing models from generating long videos lies in their audio modeling. They
typically rely on third-party off-the-shelf extractors to obtain audio
embeddings, which are then directly injected into the diffusion model via
cross-attention. Since current diffusion backbones lack any audio-related
priors, this approach causes severe latent distribution error accumulation
across video clips, leading the latent distribution of subsequent segments to
drift away from the optimal distribution gradually. To address this,
StableAvatar introduces a novel Time-step-aware Audio Adapter that prevents
error accumulation via time-step-aware modulation. During inference, we propose
a novel Audio Native Guidance Mechanism to further enhance the audio
synchronization by leveraging the diffusion's own evolving joint audio-latent
prediction as a dynamic guidance signal. To enhance the smoothness of the
infinite-length videos, we introduce a Dynamic Weighted Sliding-window Strategy
that fuses latent over time. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness
of StableAvatar both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Result: 在R3DGS任务和3D开放词汇分割基准上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: R3DGS任务和ReferSplat框架为3D多模态理解提供了新方向，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: We introduce Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation (R3DGS), a new task
that aims to segment target objects in a 3D Gaussian scene based on natural
language descriptions, which often contain spatial relationships or object
attributes. This task requires the model to identify newly described objects
that may be occluded or not directly visible in a novel view, posing a
significant challenge for 3D multi-modal understanding. Developing this
capability is crucial for advancing embodied AI. To support research in this
area, we construct the first R3DGS dataset, Ref-LERF. Our analysis reveals that
3D multi-modal understanding and spatial relationship modeling are key
challenges for R3DGS. To address these challenges, we propose ReferSplat, a
framework that explicitly models 3D Gaussian points with natural language
expressions in a spatially aware paradigm. ReferSplat achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both the newly proposed R3DGS task and 3D open-vocabulary
segmentation benchmarks. Dataset and code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能从单张图像想象4D场景（运动+3D几何），但现有神经网络方法常忽略物理原理，导致动画不真实。论文旨在通过物理约束提升动画的真实性。

Method: 提出了一种物理驱动的神经网络方法，预测表面点运动时加入物理约束（如Navier-Stokes方程），并通过3D高斯特征捕捉外观，实现多视角渲染。

Result: 实验表明，该方法生成的动画物理一致性更强，性能显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过引入物理约束，论文成功实现了从单张图像生成物理一致的4D场景，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Humans possess an exceptional ability to imagine 4D scenes, encompassing both
motion and 3D geometry, from a single still image. This ability is rooted in
our accumulated observations of similar scenes and an intuitive understanding
of physics. In this paper, we aim to replicate this capacity in neural
networks, specifically focusing on natural fluid imagery. Existing methods for
this task typically employ simplistic 2D motion estimators to animate the
image, leading to motion predictions that often defy physical principles,
resulting in unrealistic animations. Our approach introduces a novel method for
generating 4D scenes with physics-consistent animation from a single image. We
propose the use of a physics-informed neural network that predicts motion for
each surface point, guided by a loss term derived from fundamental physical
principles, including the Navier-Stokes equations. To capture appearance, we
predict feature-based 3D Gaussians from the input image and its estimated
depth, which are then animated using the predicted motions and rendered from
any desired camera perspective. Experimental results highlight the
effectiveness of our method in producing physically plausible animations,
showcasing significant performance improvements over existing methods. Our

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种半自动化事实核查（SAFC）系统，针对葡萄牙语新闻语料库（Fake.Br、COVID19.BR、MuMiN-PT）进行外部证据的补充，以解决现有数据集中缺乏外部证据的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于虚假信息传播速度快于人工核查能力，且葡萄牙语领域缺乏整合外部证据的公开数据集，亟需开发SAFC系统。

Method: 利用大型语言模型（Gemini 1.5 Flash）提取文本主要主张，并通过搜索引擎API（Google Search API、Google FactCheck Claims Search API）检索相关外部文档（证据）。同时引入数据验证和预处理框架（如近重复检测）以提高语料库质量。

Result: 成功开发了为葡萄牙语新闻语料库补充外部证据的方法，并验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了葡萄牙语领域SAFC系统的空白，为未来研究提供了高质量的数据支持。

Abstract: The accelerated dissemination of disinformation often outpaces the capacity
for manual fact-checking, highlighting the urgent need for Semi-Automated
Fact-Checking (SAFC) systems. Within the Portuguese language context, there is
a noted scarcity of publicly available datasets that integrate external
evidence, an essential component for developing robust AFC systems, as many
existing resources focus solely on classification based on intrinsic text
features. This dissertation addresses this gap by developing, applying, and
analyzing a methodology to enrich Portuguese news corpora (Fake.Br, COVID19.BR,
MuMiN-PT) with external evidence. The approach simulates a user's verification
process, employing Large Language Models (LLMs, specifically Gemini 1.5 Flash)
to extract the main claim from texts and search engine APIs (Google Search API,
Google FactCheck Claims Search API) to retrieve relevant external documents
(evidence). Additionally, a data validation and preprocessing framework,
including near-duplicate detection, is introduced to enhance the quality of the
base corpora.

Motivation: 解决少样本生物医学NER任务中LLM性能不足的问题。

Result: 动态提示显著提升了F1分数，TF-IDF和SBERT检索方法效果最佳。

Conclusion: 上下文自适应的动态提示策略对生物医学NER任务具有重要价值。

Abstract: Biomedical named entity recognition (NER) is a high-utility natural language
processing (NLP) task, and large language models (LLMs) show promise
particularly in few-shot settings (i.e., limited training data). In this
article, we address the performance challenges of LLMs for few-shot biomedical
NER by investigating a dynamic prompting strategy involving retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG). In our approach, the annotated in-context learning examples
are selected based on their similarities with the input texts, and the prompt
is dynamically updated for each instance during inference. We implemented and
optimized static and dynamic prompt engineering techniques and evaluated them
on five biomedical NER datasets. Static prompting with structured components
increased average F1-scores by 12% for GPT-4, and 11% for GPT-3.5 and LLaMA
3-70B, relative to basic static prompting. Dynamic prompting further improved
performance, with TF-IDF and SBERT retrieval methods yielding the best results,
improving average F1-scores by 7.3% and 5.6% in 5-shot and 10-shot settings,
respectively. These findings highlight the utility of contextually adaptive
prompts via RAG for biomedical NER.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经扩展定律忽略了LLM规模扩大带来的碳排放问题，需要一种方法量化模型精度与碳足迹的关系。

Method: 通过整合神经扩展模型、GPU硬件演进、并行优化和碳排放估算，构建CarbonScaling框架。

Result: 结果显示精度与碳排放呈幂律关系，但实际效率问题显著增加了扩展因子；硬件技术进步对小中型模型有效，但对超大型LLM效果有限。

Conclusion: CarbonScaling为训练更可持续和高效的LLM提供了关键见解，优化如批量大小可缓解效率问题。

Abstract: Neural scaling laws have driven the development of increasingly large
language models (LLMs) by linking accuracy improvements to growth in parameter
count, dataset size, and compute. However, these laws overlook the carbon
emissions that scale exponentially with LLM size. This paper presents
\textit{CarbonScaling}, an analytical framework that extends neural scaling
laws to incorporate both operational and embodied carbon in LLM training. By
integrating models for neural scaling, GPU hardware evolution, parallelism
optimization, and carbon estimation, \textit{CarbonScaling} quantitatively
connects model accuracy to carbon footprint. Results show that while a
power-law relationship between accuracy and carbon holds, real-world
inefficiencies significantly increase the scaling factor. Hardware technology
scaling reduces carbon emissions for small to mid-sized models, but offers
diminishing returns for extremely large LLMs due to communication overhead and
underutilized GPUs. Training optimizations-especially aggressive critical batch
size scaling-help alleviate this inefficiency. \textit{CarbonScaling} offers
key insights for training more sustainable and carbon-efficient LLMs.

Motivation: 现有tokenizer在多语言环境下效率低下，特别是在高多样性和复杂性的Indic脚本中表现不佳。

Method: 通过系统研究词汇量、预分词规则和训练语料组成，提出了一种新的数据组合算法。

Result: 新算法使token-to-word比例降低约6%，平均提升40%的效率，显著改善模型性能和推理速度。

Conclusion: tokenization是构建高效、可扩展多语言LLM的关键因素之一。

Abstract: While model architecture and training objectives are well-studied,
tokenization, particularly in multilingual contexts, remains a relatively
neglected aspect of Large Language Model (LLM) development. Existing tokenizers
often exhibit high token-to-word ratios, inefficient use of context length, and
slower inference. We present a systematic study that links vocabulary size,
pre-tokenization rules, and training-corpus composition to both token-to-word
efficiency and model quality. To ground our analysis in a linguistically
diverse context, we conduct extensive experiments on Indic scripts, which
present unique challenges due to their high script diversity and orthographic
complexity. Drawing on the insights from these analyses, we propose a novel
algorithm for data composition that balances multilingual data for tokenizer
training. Our observations on pretokenization strategies significantly improve
model performance, and our data composition algorithm reduces the average
token-to-word ratio by approximately 6% with respect to the conventional data
randomization approach. Our tokenizer achieves more than 40% improvement on
average token-to-word ratio against stateof-the-art multilingual Indic models.
This improvement yields measurable gains in both model performance and
inference speed. This highlights tokenization alongside architecture and
training objectives as a critical lever for building efficient, scalable
multilingual LLMs

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维文本嵌入在效率与计算成本上存在问题，需要一种方法直接融入预训练LLM工作流以降低维度。

Method: 提取文本嵌入后，通过监督增强自编码器学习低维任务相关潜在因子，建模非线性结构。

Result: 实验表明AEALT在分类、异常检测和预测任务中优于原始嵌入和标准降维方法。

Conclusion: AEALT是一种高效且广泛适用的框架，显著提升了高维文本嵌入在下游任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate text embeddings from text data,
producing vector representations that capture the semantic meaning and
contextual relationships of words. However, the high dimensionality of these
embeddings often impedes efficiency and drives up computational cost in
downstream tasks. To address this, we propose AutoEncoder-Augmented Learning
with Text (AEALT), a supervised, factor-augmented framework that incorporates
dimension reduction directly into pre-trained LLM workflows. First, we extract
embeddings from text documents; next, we pass them through a supervised
augmented autoencoder to learn low-dimensional, task-relevant latent factors.
By modeling the nonlinear structure of complex embeddings, AEALT outperforms
conventional deep-learning approaches that rely on raw embeddings. We validate
its broad applicability with extensive experiments on classification, anomaly
detection, and prediction tasks using multiple real-world public datasets.
Numerical results demonstrate that AEALT yields substantial gains over both
vanilla embeddings and several standard dimension reduction methods.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否能像专家导师一样根据学习者的理解动态调整教学策略，填补了现有研究中忽视学习者认知状态的空白。

Method: 提出GuideEval基准，基于真实教育对话，通过感知、编排和激发三阶段行为框架评估教学指导能力，并引入行为引导微调策略。

Result: 现有LLMs在适应学习者困惑或需要引导时表现不佳，但行为引导微调显著提升了指导性能。

Conclusion: 研究倡导从孤立内容评估转向以学习者为中心的交互范式，为Socratic LLMs的评估提供了新方向。

Abstract: The conversational capabilities of large language models hold significant
promise for enabling scalable and interactive tutoring. While prior research
has primarily examined their capacity for Socratic questioning, it often
overlooks a critical dimension: adaptively guiding learners based on their
cognitive states. This study shifts focus from mere question generation to the
broader instructional guidance capability. We ask: Can LLMs emulate expert
tutors who dynamically adjust strategies in response to learners'
understanding? To investigate this, we propose GuideEval, a benchmark grounded
in authentic educational dialogues that evaluates pedagogical guidance through
a three-phase behavioral framework: (1) Perception, inferring learner states;
(2) Orchestration, adapting instructional strategies; and (3) Elicitation,
stimulating proper reflections. Empirical findings reveal that existing LLMs
frequently fail to provide effective adaptive scaffolding when learners exhibit
confusion or require redirection. Furthermore, we introduce a behavior-guided
finetuning strategy that leverages behavior-prompted instructional dialogues,
significantly enhancing guidance performance. By shifting the focus from
isolated content evaluation to learner-centered interaction, our work advocates
a more dialogic paradigm for evaluating Socratic LLMs.

Result: 实验表明，合成数据集优于基线方法，与专家策划的数据集相当，且数据多样性提升遗忘效果。

Conclusion: 合成数据集为广泛领域的实用、可扩展遗忘提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Modern large language models often encode sensitive, harmful, or copyrighted
knowledge, raising the need for post-hoc unlearning-the ability to remove
specific domains of knowledge from a model without full retraining. A major
bottleneck in current unlearning pipelines is constructing effective forget
sets-datasets that approximate the target domain and guide the model to forget
it. In this work, we introduce a scalable, automated approach to generate
high-quality forget sets using language models themselves. Our method
synthesizes textbook-style data through a structured prompting pipeline,
requiring only a domain name as input. Through experiments on unlearning
biosecurity, cybersecurity, and Harry Potter novels, we show that our synthetic
datasets consistently outperform the baseline synthetic alternatives and are
comparable to the expert-curated ones. Additionally, ablation studies reveal
that the multi-step generation pipeline significantly boosts data diversity,
which in turn improves unlearning utility. Overall, our findings suggest that
synthetic datasets offer a promising path toward practical, scalable unlearning
for a wide range of emerging domains without the need for manual intervention.

Motivation: 现有评估方法（如BrowseComp）依赖动态且不透明的网络搜索API，导致公平性和透明度问题，难以对深度研究LLM的能力进行准确评估。

Method: 基于BrowseComp构建BrowseComp-Plus基准，采用固定语料库，包含人工验证的支持文档和挑战性负样本，支持可控实验。

Result: BrowseComp-Plus能有效区分系统性能，例如GPT-5与Qwen3-Embedding-8B检索器结合时准确率达70.1%，优于其他组合。

Conclusion: BrowseComp-Plus为深度研究系统和检索方法提供了全面的评估框架，有助于分析检索效果、引用准确性和上下文工程。

Abstract: Deep-Research agents, which integrate large language models (LLMs) with
search tools, have shown success in improving the effectiveness of handling
complex queries that require iterative search planning and reasoning over
search results. Evaluations on current benchmarks like BrowseComp relies on
black-box live web search APIs, have notable limitations in (1) fairness:
dynamic and opaque web APIs hinder fair comparisons and reproducibility of deep
research methods; (2) transparency: lack of control over the document corpus
makes it difficult to isolate retriever contributions. In other words, the
current evaluations may compare a complete deep research system at a given
time, but they do not foster well-controlled experiments to provide insights
into the capability of underlying deep research LLMs. To address these
challenges, we introduce BrowseComp-Plus, a benchmark derived from BrowseComp,
employing a fixed, carefully curated corpus. Each query in BrowseComp-Plus
includes human-verified supporting documents and mined challenging negatives,
enabling controlled experimentation. The benchmark is shown to be effective in
distinguishing the performance of deep research systems. For instance, the
open-source model Search-R1, when paired with the BM25 retriever, achieves
3.86% accuracy, whereas the GPT-5 achieves 55.9%. Integrating the GPT-5 with
the Qwen3-Embedding-8B retriever further enhances its accuracy to 70.1% with
fewer search calls. This benchmark allows comprehensive evaluation and
disentangled analysis of deep research agents and retrieval methods, fostering
insights into retrieval effectiveness, citation accuracy, and context
engineering in Deep-Research system.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了不依赖合并列表的BPE推理算法对语言模型性能的影响，发现非目标性算法对性能影响较小，为更简单且隐私保护的标记化方案提供了可能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BPE合并列表可能成为攻击面，泄露训练数据信息，因此研究不依赖合并列表的推理算法的影响。

Method: 研究两类BPE推理方案：a) 故意偏离合并列表（如随机合并顺序或破坏合并列表）；b) 不依赖合并列表的非目标性算法（如贪婪或精确压缩文本）。

Result: 故意偏离合并列表导致性能显著下降，而非目标性算法对性能影响极小。

Conclusion: 非目标性BPE推理算法可简化标记化方案并增强隐私保护，同时不显著损害模型性能。

Abstract: Standard Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization compresses text by pairing a
learned token vocabulary with a detailed merge list. Recent work has shown that
this merge list exposes a potential attack surface for extracting information
about language model's training data. In this paper, we explore the downstream
impact of BPE inference algorithms that do not rely on this merge list at all,
and hence differ from the encoding process during BPE training. To address this
question, we investigate two broad classes of BPE inference schemes that differ
from BPE application during training: a) targeted deviation from merge-lists
including random merge orders, and various corruptions of merge list involving
deletion/truncation, and b) non-targeted BPE inference algorithms that do not
depend on the merge list but focus on compressing the text either greedily or
exactly. Extensive experiments across diverse language modeling tasks like
accuracy-based QA benchmarks, machine translation, and open-ended generation
reveal that while targeted deviation from the merge lists exhibits significant
degradation in language model performance, the non-targeted merge-list-free
inference algorithms result in minimal impact on downstream performance that is
often much smaller than expected. These findings pave way for simpler and
potentially more privacy-preserving tokenization schemes that do not
catastrophically compromise model performance.

*Daniel Wang,Eli Brignac,Minjia Mao,Xiao Fang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLMs）存在刻板印象偏差和偏离偏差，可能对多群体造成潜在危害。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在生成内容中可能表现出的两种偏差及其潜在风险。

Method: 通过让四种先进LLMs生成个人资料，分析其与政治、宗教等属性的关联。

Result: 所有测试的LLMs均对多群体表现出显著的刻板印象和偏离偏差。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在推断用户属性时的偏差及其潜在危害。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely applied across diverse domains,
raising concerns about their limitations and potential risks. In this study, we
investigate two types of bias that LLMs may display: stereotype bias and
deviation bias. Stereotype bias refers to when LLMs consistently associate
specific traits with a particular demographic group. Deviation bias reflects
the disparity between the demographic distributions extracted from
LLM-generated content and real-world demographic distributions. By asking four
advanced LLMs to generate profiles of individuals, we examine the associations
between each demographic group and attributes such as political affiliation,
religion, and sexual orientation. Our experimental results show that all
examined LLMs exhibit both significant stereotype bias and deviation bias
towards multiple groups. Our findings uncover the biases that occur when LLMs
infer user attributes and shed light on the potential harms of LLM-generated
outputs.

*Jonathan Shaw,Dillon Mee,Timothy Khouw,Zackary Leech,Daniel Wilson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）在翻译资源稀缺语言（如Kanuri）时的表现，发现平行句子是最有效的数据源，而语法资源单独使用时效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kanuri语言虽然使用者众多，但数字资源稀缺，研究旨在探索如何利用语言资源（如语法、词典和平行句子）提升LLM的翻译质量。

Method: 设计两个数据集（健康和通用术语），提供不同语言资源组合（语法、词典、平行句子），通过自动指标和母语者评估翻译效果。

Result: 平行句子是最有效的数据源；语法资源虽优于零样本翻译，但单独使用效果不佳；LLM在准确性（意义）上表现优于流畅性（语法）。

Conclusion: LLM翻译评估需多维指标，仅依赖语法资源无法有效支持领域特定翻译。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art models demonstrate capacity to leverage in-context
learning to translate into previously unseen language contexts. Tanzer et al.
[2024] utilize language materials (e.g. a grammar) to improve translation
quality for Kalamang using large language models (LLMs). We focus on Kanuri, a
language that, despite having substantial speaker population, has minimal
digital resources. We design two datasets for evaluation: one focused on health
and humanitarian terms, and another containing generalized terminology,
investigating how domain-specific tasks impact LLM translation quality.
  By providing different combinations of language resources (grammar,
dictionary, and parallel sentences), we measure LLM translation effectiveness,
comparing results to native speaker translations and human linguist
performance. We evaluate using both automatic metrics and native speaker
assessments of fluency and accuracy.
  Results demonstrate that parallel sentences remain the most effective data
source, outperforming other methods in human evaluations and automatic metrics.
While incorporating grammar improves over zero-shot translation, it fails as an
effective standalone data source. Human evaluations reveal that LLMs achieve
accuracy (meaning) more effectively than fluency (grammaticality).
  These findings suggest LLM translation evaluation benefits from
multidimensional assessment beyond simple accuracy metrics, and that grammar
alone, without parallel sentences, does not provide sufficient context for
effective domain-specific translation.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了思维链提示对语言模型公平性的影响，发现模型决策中的偏见与其思维步骤中的偏见相关性较低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管语言模型表现优异，但其存在的性别、种族等偏见问题限制了实际应用。本文旨在探究思维链提示是否揭示模型偏见。

Method: 通过公平性指标对5种流行大语言模型进行实验，量化11种偏见在模型思维和输出中的表现。

Result: 模型思维中的偏见与输出偏见相关性较低（多数情况下相关系数小于0.6，p值小于0.001）。

Conclusion: 与人类不同，测试的模型即使决策有偏见，其思维步骤未必同样存在偏见。

Abstract: The impressive performance of language models is undeniable. However, the
presence of biases based on gender, race, socio-economic status, physical
appearance, and sexual orientation makes the deployment of language models
challenging. This paper studies the effect of chain-of-thought prompting, a
recent approach that studies the steps followed by the model before it
responds, on fairness. More specifically, we ask the following question:
\textit{Do biased models have biased thoughts}? To answer our question, we
conduct experiments on $5$ popular large language models using fairness metrics
to quantify $11$ different biases in the model's thoughts and output. Our
results show that the bias in the thinking steps is not highly correlated with
the output bias (less than $0.6$ correlation with a $p$-value smaller than
$0.001$ in most cases). In other words, unlike human beings, the tested models
with biased decisions do not always possess biased thoughts.

*Evangelia Spiliopoulou,Riccardo Fogliato,Hanna Burnsky,Tamer Soliman,Jie Ma,Graham Horwood,Miguel Ballesteros*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种统计框架，用于识别和量化大语言模型（LLM）作为评委时的自我偏见（self-bias），并通过实验验证了某些模型确实存在这种偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为评委时可能对自身输出评分过高（自我偏见），导致模型性能评估失真，但现有研究未能明确区分模型质量差异与偏见。

Method: 提出了一种统计框架，通过建模LLM评委对自身和其他模型输出的评分分布差异，并结合第三方评委（如人类）的评分来量化自我偏见。

Result: 实验发现某些模型（如GPT-4o和Claude 3.5 Sonnet）确实存在自我偏见，且对同家族模型输出评分更高（家族偏见）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了使用LLM评委的潜在问题，并提供了减少偏见的实用建议。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can serve as judges that offer rapid and
reliable assessments of other LLM outputs. However, models may systematically
assign overly favorable ratings to their own outputs, a phenomenon known as
self-bias, which can distort evaluations of true model performance. Previous
studies often conflate genuine differences in model quality with bias or
incorrectly assume that evaluations from LLMs and humans follow the same rating
distributions. In this work, we present a statistical framework that explicitly
formalizes assumptions under which self-bias can be identified and estimated.
Our method models the difference in the scoring distribution that
LLM-as-a-judge assigns to its own completions compared to other models, while
accounting for the underlying quality of the completions provided by an
independent, third-party judge (e.g., humans). Our method reliably isolates and
quantifies self-bias, even when models vary in ability, ensuring that genuine
performance differences are not mistaken for self-bias. We conduct an empirical
analysis of self-bias on a large dataset (>5000 prompt-completion pairs)
consisting of expert human annotations and judgments from nine different LLM
judges. We find that some models, such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet,
systematically assign higher scores to their own outputs. These models also
display family-bias; systematically assigning higher ratings to outputs
produced by other models of the same family. Our findings highlight potential
pitfalls of using LLM judges and offer practical guidance to mitigate biases
when interpreting automated evaluations.

*Komala Subramanyam Cherukuri,Pranav Abishai Moses,Aisa Sakata,Jiangping Chen,Haihua Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种可扩展的框架，利用LLM（如ChatGPT、Llama和Qwen）对日裔美国人监禁口述历史进行语义和情感标注，展示了LLM在敏感历史背景下的高效应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 口述历史是记录系统性不公和历史抹除社区经历的重要资源，但其非结构化格式、情感复杂性和高标注成本限制了大尺度分析。

Method: 采用多阶段方法，结合专家标注、提示设计和LLM评估，测试零样本、少样本和RAG策略，标注了558个句子并扩展到92,191个句子。

Result: ChatGPT在语义分类中表现最佳（F1 88.71%），Llama在情感分析中略优（82.66%）。最佳提示配置成功标注了大量数据。

Conclusion: LLM在精心设计的提示下可高效处理大规模口述历史标注，为数字人文和集体记忆保护提供了可复用的管道和伦理指导。

Abstract: Oral histories are vital records of lived experience, particularly within
communities affected by systemic injustice and historical erasure. Effective
and efficient analysis of their oral history archives can promote access and
understanding of the oral histories. However, Large-scale analysis of these
archives remains limited due to their unstructured format, emotional
complexity, and high annotation costs. This paper presents a scalable framework
to automate semantic and sentiment annotation for Japanese American
Incarceration Oral History. Using LLMs, we construct a high-quality dataset,
evaluate multiple models, and test prompt engineering strategies in
historically sensitive contexts. Our multiphase approach combines expert
annotation, prompt design, and LLM evaluation with ChatGPT, Llama, and Qwen. We
labeled 558 sentences from 15 narrators for sentiment and semantic
classification, then evaluated zero-shot, few-shot, and RAG strategies. For
semantic classification, ChatGPT achieved the highest F1 score (88.71%),
followed by Llama (84.99%) and Qwen (83.72%). For sentiment analysis, Llama
slightly outperformed Qwen (82.66%) and ChatGPT (82.29%), with all models
showing comparable results. The best prompt configurations were used to
annotate 92,191 sentences from 1,002 interviews in the JAIOH collection. Our
findings show that LLMs can effectively perform semantic and sentiment
annotation across large oral history collections when guided by well-designed
prompts. This study provides a reusable annotation pipeline and practical
guidance for applying LLMs in culturally sensitive archival analysis. By
bridging archival ethics with scalable NLP techniques, this work lays the
groundwork for responsible use of artificial intelligence in digital humanities
and preservation of collective memory. GitHub:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱研究仅关注单轮攻击，而实际应用中LLMs需处理多轮对话，因此多轮越狱可能带来更严重的安全威胁。

Method: 构建了多轮越狱基准（MTJ-Bench），用于测试开源和闭源模型在多轮对话中的安全性。

Result: 揭示了多轮越狱的新漏洞，呼吁社区关注并提升LLMs的安全性。

Conclusion: 多轮越狱是LLMs安全的新挑战，需进一步研究和改进模型安全性。

Abstract: Current jailbreaking work on large language models (LLMs) aims to elicit
unsafe outputs from given prompts. However, it only focuses on single-turn
jailbreaking targeting one specific query. On the contrary, the advanced LLMs
are designed to handle extremely long contexts and can thus conduct multi-turn
conversations. So, we propose exploring multi-turn jailbreaking, in which the
jailbroken LLMs are continuously tested on more than the first-turn
conversation or a single target query. This is an even more serious threat
because 1) it is common for users to continue asking relevant follow-up
questions to clarify certain jailbroken details, and 2) it is also possible
that the initial round of jailbreaking causes the LLMs to respond to additional
irrelevant questions consistently. As the first step (First draft done at June
2024) in exploring multi-turn jailbreaking, we construct a Multi-Turn Jailbreak
Benchmark (MTJ-Bench) for benchmarking this setting on a series of open- and
closed-source models and provide novel insights into this new safety threat. By
revealing this new vulnerability, we aim to call for community efforts to build
safer LLMs and pave the way for a more in-depth understanding of jailbreaking
LLMs.

Conclusion: SEVADE通过多代理协作和分离评估有效解决了讽刺检测中的幻觉问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Sarcasm detection is a crucial yet challenging Natural Language Processing
task. Existing Large Language Model methods are often limited by
single-perspective analysis, static reasoning pathways, and a susceptibility to
hallucination when processing complex ironic rhetoric, which impacts their
accuracy and reliability. To address these challenges, we propose **SEVADE**, a
novel **S**elf-**Ev**olving multi-agent **A**nalysis framework with
**D**ecoupled **E**valuation for hallucination-resistant sarcasm detection. The
core of our framework is a Dynamic Agentive Reasoning Engine (DARE), which
utilizes a team of specialized agents grounded in linguistic theory to perform
a multifaceted deconstruction of the text and generate a structured reasoning
chain. Subsequently, a separate lightweight rationale adjudicator (RA) performs
the final classification based solely on this reasoning chain. This decoupled
architecture is designed to mitigate the risk of hallucination by separating
complex reasoning from the final judgment. Extensive experiments on four
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with average improvements of **6.75%** in Accuracy and **6.29%**
in Macro-F1 score.

Result: 开发了标注数据集，并比较了不同反馈生成系统的性能，评估标准包括相关性、准确性和可理解性。

Conclusion: 新框架和方法能更有效地支持语言学习，生成更具教育意义的反馈。

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have contributed to the
development of automated writing evaluation (AWE) systems that can correct
grammatical errors. However, while these systems are effective at improving
text, they are not optimally designed for language learning. They favor direct
revisions, often with a click-to-fix functionality that can be applied without
considering the reason for the correction. Meanwhile, depending on the error
type, learners may benefit most from simple explanations and strategically
indirect hints, especially on generalizable grammatical rules. To support the
generation of such feedback, we introduce an annotation framework that models
each error's error type and generalizability. For error type classification, we
introduce a typology focused on inferring learners' knowledge gaps by
connecting their errors to specific grammatical patterns. Following this
framework, we collect a dataset of annotated learner errors and corresponding
human-written feedback comments, each labeled as a direct correction or hint.
With this data, we evaluate keyword-guided, keyword-free, and template-guided
methods of generating feedback using large language models (LLMs). Human
teachers examined each system's outputs, assessing them on grounds including
relevance, factuality, and comprehensibility. We report on the development of
the dataset and the comparative performance of the systems investigated.

Result: 成功合并三个数据集，并在金融领域的小规模数据上提升了NER性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为多源NER语料库整合提供了高效、可解释且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental task in natural language
processing. It remains a research hotspot due to its wide applicability across
domains. Although recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved
NER performance, they rely heavily on large, high-quality annotated datasets.
However, building these datasets is expensive and time-consuming, posing a
major bottleneck for further research. Current dataset merging approaches
mainly focus on strategies like manual label mapping or constructing label
graphs, which lack interpretability and scalability. To address this, we
propose an automatic label alignment method based on label similarity. The
method combines empirical and semantic similarities, using a greedy pairwise
merging strategy to unify label spaces across different datasets. Experiments
are conducted in two stages: first, merging three existing NER datasets into a
unified corpus with minimal impact on NER performance; second, integrating this
corpus with a small-scale, self-built dataset in the financial domain. The
results show that our method enables effective dataset merging and enhances NER
performance in the low-resource financial domain. This study presents an
efficient, interpretable, and scalable solution for integrating multi-source
NER corpora.

Abstract: Personal information is abundant on users' devices, from structured data in
calendar, shopping records or fitness tools, to unstructured contents in mail

users with answers for complex questions that involve filters, joins and
aggregation over heterogeneous sources. The unique trait of ReQAP is that it
recursively decomposes questions and incrementally builds an operator tree for
execution. Both the question interpretation and the individual operators make
smart use of light-weight language models, with judicious fine-tuning. The demo
showcases the rich functionality for advanced user questions, and also offers
detailed tracking of how the answers are computed by the operators in the
execution tree. Being able to trace answers back to the underlying sources is
vital for human comprehensibility and user trust in the system.

Motivation: 现有对话数据多样性有限，导致大型语言模型在角色一致性对话生成中表现不佳。

Method: SBS框架通过名词替换增强对话数据，并利用语义相似度评分作为质量代理，训练模型在生成时结合评分。

Result: 在PERSONA-CHAT和ConvAI2数据集上的实验表明，SBS优于现有方法，提升了角色一致性对话的生成质量。

Conclusion: SBS框架通过评分条件训练，显著提升了对话模型在角色一致性方面的表现。

Abstract: Persona-based dialogue generation is an important milestone towards building
conversational artificial intelligence. Despite the ever-improving capabilities
of large language models (LLMs), effectively integrating persona fidelity in
conversations remains challenging due to the limited diversity in existing
dialogue data. We propose a novel framework SBS (Score-Before-Speaking), which
outperforms previous methods and yields improvements for both million and
billion-parameter models. Unlike previous methods, SBS unifies the learning of
responses and their relative quality into a single step. The key innovation is
to train a dialogue model to correlate augmented responses with a quality score
during training and then leverage this knowledge at inference. We use
noun-based substitution for augmentation and semantic similarity-based scores
as a proxy for response quality. Through extensive experiments with benchmark
datasets (PERSONA-CHAT and ConvAI2), we show that score-conditioned training
allows existing models to better capture a spectrum of persona-consistent
dialogues. Our ablation studies also demonstrate that including scores in the
input prompt during training is superior to conventional training setups. Code

Motivation: 现有检测方法泛化性差且易受攻击，而LLM生成文本情感一致性较高，人类文本情感变化更大。

Method: 定义两个互补指标（情感分布一致性和情感分布保持性）量化情感稳定性，并在多种数据集和LLM上评估。

Result: 在Gemini-1.5-Pro和GPT-4-0613上F1分数分别提升16%和11%，且对攻击和文本长度变化更鲁棒。

Conclusion: SentiDetect在检测LLM生成文本方面表现优越，具有更强的泛化性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has resulted in
increasingly sophisticated AI-generated content, posing significant challenges
in distinguishing LLM-generated text from human-written language. Existing
detection methods, primarily based on lexical heuristics or fine-tuned
classifiers, often suffer from limited generalizability and are vulnerable to
paraphrasing, adversarial perturbations, and cross-domain shifts. In this work,
we propose SentiDetect, a model-agnostic framework for detecting LLM-generated
text by analyzing the divergence in sentiment distribution stability. Our
method is motivated by the empirical observation that LLM outputs tend to
exhibit emotionally consistent patterns, whereas human-written texts display
greater emotional variability. To capture this phenomenon, we define two
complementary metrics: sentiment distribution consistency and sentiment
distribution preservation, which quantify stability under sentiment-altering
and semantic-preserving transformations. We evaluate SentiDetect on five
diverse datasets and a range of advanced LLMs,including Gemini-1.5-Pro,
Claude-3, GPT-4-0613, and LLaMa-3.3. Experimental results demonstrate its
superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, with over 16% and 11% F1 score
improvements on Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-4-0613, respectively. Moreover,
SentiDetect also shows greater robustness to paraphrasing, adversarial attacks,
and text length variations, outperforming existing detectors in challenging
scenarios.

Abstract: Quranic Question Answering presents unique challenges due to the linguistic
complexity of Classical Arabic and the semantic richness of religious texts. In
this paper, we propose a novel two-stage framework that addresses both passage
retrieval and answer extraction. For passage retrieval, we ensemble fine-tuned
Arabic language models to achieve superior ranking performance. For answer
extraction, we employ instruction-tuned large language models with few-shot
prompting to overcome the limitations of fine-tuning on small datasets. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the Quran QA 2023 Shared Task,
with a MAP@10 of 0.3128 and MRR@10 of 0.5763 for retrieval, and a pAP@10 of
0.669 for extraction, substantially outperforming previous methods. These
results demonstrate that combining model ensembling and instruction-tuned
language models effectively addresses the challenges of low-resource question

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种渐进式训练方法，将预训练模型转换为1-bit量化模型，避免了从头训练的高成本，并提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常从头训练1-bit量化模型，未能充分利用预训练模型，导致高成本和精度下降。

Method: 采用渐进式训练方法，结合二进制感知初始化和双尺度补偿，逐步将浮点权重转换为二值化权重。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种规模的LLM上优于现有方法，实现了高性能的1-bit量化。

Conclusion: 通过预训练模型实现高性能1-bit量化，避免了昂贵的从头训练。

Abstract: 1-bit LLM quantization offers significant advantages in reducing storage and
computational costs. However, existing methods typically train 1-bit LLMs from
scratch, failing to fully leverage pre-trained models. This results in high
training costs and notable accuracy degradation. We identify that the large gap
between full precision and 1-bit representations makes direct adaptation
difficult. In this paper, we introduce a consistent progressive training for
both forward and backward, smoothly converting the floating-point weights into
the binarized ones. Additionally, we incorporate binary-aware initialization
and dual-scaling compensation to reduce the difficulty of progressive training
and improve the performance. Experimental results on LLMs of various sizes
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. Our results show
that high-performance 1-bit LLMs can be achieved using pre-trained models,
eliminating the need for expensive training from scratch.

*Mao Li,Fred Conrad,Johann Gagnon-Bartsch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Vec2Summ是一种新颖的抽象摘要方法，通过语义压缩任务实现，利用语义嵌入空间的均值向量表示文档集合并生成摘要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于LLM的摘要方法在上下文长度限制、可控性和扩展性方面的不足。

Method: 通过均值向量表示文档集合，结合高斯分布的随机性进行嵌入反转生成摘要。

Result: Vec2Summ生成的摘要主题覆盖和效率与直接LLM摘要相当，但细节较少。

Conclusion: Vec2Summ在可扩展性、语义控制和语料库级抽象方面具有潜力。

Abstract: We propose Vec2Summ, a novel method for abstractive summarization that frames
the task as semantic compression. Vec2Summ represents a document collection
using a single mean vector in the semantic embedding space, capturing the
central meaning of the corpus. To reconstruct fluent summaries, we perform
embedding inversion -- decoding this mean vector into natural language using a
generative language model. To improve reconstruction quality and capture some
degree of topical variability, we introduce stochasticity by sampling from a
Gaussian distribution centered on the mean. This approach is loosely analogous
to bagging in ensemble learning, where controlled randomness encourages more
robust and varied outputs. Vec2Summ addresses key limitations of LLM-based
summarization methods. It avoids context-length constraints, enables
interpretable and controllable generation via semantic parameters, and scales
efficiently with corpus size -- requiring only $O(d + d^2)$ parameters.
Empirical results show that Vec2Summ produces coherent summaries for topically
focused, order-invariant corpora, with performance comparable to direct LLM
summarization in terms of thematic coverage and efficiency, albeit with less
fine-grained detail. These results underscore Vec2Summ's potential in settings
where scalability, semantic control, and corpus-level abstraction are
prioritized.

Result: 发布了多轮对话数据集，支持文化感知和以人为中心的大语言模型研究。

Conclusion: SEADialogues为东南亚文化对话研究提供了重要资源，推动了文化感知对话系统的发展。

Abstract: Although numerous datasets have been developed to support dialogue systems,

natural human conversations. To address this gap, we introduce SEADialogues, a
culturally grounded dialogue dataset centered on Southeast Asia, a region with
over 700 million people and immense cultural diversity. Our dataset features
dialogues in eight languages from six Southeast Asian countries, many of which
are low-resource despite having sizable speaker populations. To enhance
cultural relevance and personalization, each dialogue includes persona
attributes and two culturally grounded topics that reflect everyday life in the
respective communities. Furthermore, we release a multi-turn dialogue dataset
to advance research on culturally aware and human-centric large language
models, including conversational dialogue agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ARCE提出了一种通过LLM生成简单解释（Cote）来增强RoBERTa模型的方法，显著提升了AEC领域NER任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AEC领域NER任务中预训练模型因领域术语和复杂关系导致的性能限制，避免传统方法的高成本问题。

Method: 使用LLM生成简单解释（Cote）作为知识库，逐步预训练RoBERTa模型，再进行下游任务微调。

Result: 在AEC基准数据集上达到77.20%的Macro-F1分数，表现优于复杂知识生成方法。

Conclusion: 简单解释性知识比复杂知识更有效，ARCE为领域适应提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate information extraction from specialized texts is a critical
challenge, particularly for named entity recognition (NER) in the architecture,
engineering, and construction (AEC) domain to support automated rule checking
(ARC). The performance of standard pre-trained models is often constrained by
the domain gap, as they struggle to interpret the specialized terminology and
complex relational contexts inherent in AEC texts. Although this issue can be
mitigated by further pre-training on large, human-curated domain corpora, as
exemplified by methods like ARCBERT, this approach is both labor-intensive and
cost-prohibitive. Consequently, leveraging large language models (LLMs) for
automated knowledge generation has emerged as a promising alternative. However,
the optimal strategy for generating knowledge that can genuinely enhance
smaller, efficient models remains an open question. To address this, we propose
ARCE (augmented RoBERTa with contextualized elucidations), a novel approach
that systematically explores and optimizes this generation process. ARCE
employs an LLM to first generate a corpus of simple, direct explanations, which
we term Cote, and then uses this corpus to incrementally pre-train a RoBERTa
model prior to its fine-tuning on the downstream task. Our extensive
experiments show that ARCE establishes a new state-of-the-art on a benchmark
AEC dataset, achieving a Macro-F1 score of 77.20%. This result also reveals a
key finding: simple, explanation-based knowledge proves surprisingly more
effective than complex, role-based rationales for this task. The code is
publicly available at:https://github.com/nxcc-lab/ARCE.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了BharatBBQ，一个针对印度多语言和文化背景的偏见评估基准，填补了现有西方中心化基准的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏见评估基准（如BBQ）主要关注西方语境，无法适用于印度多元文化背景，因此需要开发本土化基准。

Method: 通过翻译和验证，将49,108个单语示例扩展到8种语言的392,864个示例，评估5种多语言模型在零样本和少样本设置下的偏见表现。

Result: 研究发现印度语言中的偏见普遍存在且比英语更严重，突显了基于语言和文化的偏见评估的必要性。

Conclusion: BharatBBQ为印度多语言和文化背景提供了有效的偏见评估工具，强调了本土化基准的重要性。

Abstract: Evaluating social biases in language models (LMs) is crucial for ensuring
fairness and minimizing the reinforcement of harmful stereotypes in AI systems.
Existing benchmarks, such as the Bias Benchmark for Question Answering (BBQ),
primarily focus on Western contexts, limiting their applicability to the Indian
context. To address this gap, we introduce BharatBBQ, a culturally adapted
benchmark designed to assess biases in Hindi, English, Marathi, Bengali, Tamil,
Telugu, Odia, and Assamese. BharatBBQ covers 13 social categories, including 3
intersectional groups, reflecting prevalent biases in the Indian sociocultural
landscape. Our dataset contains 49,108 examples in one language that are
expanded using translation and verification to 392,864 examples in eight
different languages. We evaluate five multilingual LM families across zero and
few-shot settings, analyzing their bias and stereotypical bias scores. Our
findings highlight persistent biases across languages and social categories and
often amplified biases in Indian languages compared to English, demonstrating
the necessity of linguistically and culturally grounded benchmarks for bias
evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LessIsMore是一种无需训练的稀疏注意力机制，通过全局注意力模式提升推理任务的效率和准确性，减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有稀疏注意力机制因长生成推理中累积误差导致的准确性下降问题，同时避免高令牌保留率或昂贵的重新训练需求。

Method: 利用全局注意力模式，聚合局部注意力头的令牌选择与上下文信息，实现跨头令牌统一排名，避免为每个头维护单独令牌子集。

Result: 在多种推理任务和基准测试中，LessIsMore保持甚至提升准确性，解码速度平均提升1.1倍，令牌关注数量减少2倍且无准确性损失。

Conclusion: LessIsMore在减少计算开销的同时保持或提升推理准确性，优于现有稀疏注意力方法，实现端到端速度提升1.13倍。

Abstract: Large reasoning models achieve strong performance through test-time scaling
but incur substantial computational overhead, particularly from excessive token
generation when processing short input prompts. While sparse attention
mechanisms can reduce latency and memory usage, existing approaches suffer from
significant accuracy degradation due to accumulated errors during
long-generation reasoning. These methods generally require either high token
retention rates or expensive retraining. We introduce LessIsMore, a
training-free sparse attention mechanism for reasoning tasks, which leverages
global attention patterns rather than relying on traditional head-specific
local optimizations. LessIsMore aggregates token selections from local
attention heads with recent contextual information, enabling unified cross-head
token ranking for future decoding layers. This unified selection improves
generalization and efficiency by avoiding the need to maintain separate token
subsets per head. Evaluation across diverse reasoning tasks and benchmarks
shows that LessIsMore preserves -- and in some cases improves -- accuracy while
achieving a $1.1\times$ average decoding speed-up compared to full attention.
Moreover, LessIsMore attends to $2\times$ fewer tokens without accuracy loss,
achieving a $1.13\times$ end-to-end speed-up compared to existing sparse
attention methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在交叉性偏见中的表现，提出了新的评估基准WinoIdentity和指标Coreference Confidence Disparity，发现模型在双重劣势身份上表现最不确定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在资源受限场景中被广泛使用，但可能加剧社会偏见，尤其是交叉性偏见。现有研究多关注单一维度，缺乏对多维度交叉偏见的评估。

Method: 通过扩展WinoBias数据集，创建包含25个标记和10个属性的WinoIdentity基准，评估50种偏见模式。提出Coreference Confidence Disparity指标，衡量模型对不同交叉性身份的置信度差异。

Result: 评估五个LLMs发现，模型在某些交叉性身份上的置信度差异高达40%，对双重劣势身份在反刻板印象场景中表现最不确定。

Conclusion: LLMs的表现可能更多依赖记忆而非逻辑推理，存在价值对齐和有效性双重问题，可能导致社会危害。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance, leading to
their widespread adoption as decision-support tools in resource-constrained
contexts like hiring and admissions. There is, however, scientific consensus
that AI systems can reflect and exacerbate societal biases, raising concerns
about identity-based harm when used in critical social contexts. Prior work has
laid a solid foundation for assessing bias in LLMs by evaluating demographic
disparities in different language reasoning tasks. In this work, we extend
single-axis fairness evaluations to examine intersectional bias, recognizing
that when multiple axes of discrimination intersect, they create distinct
patterns of disadvantage. We create a new benchmark called WinoIdentity by
augmenting the WinoBias dataset with 25 demographic markers across 10
attributes, including age, nationality, and race, intersected with binary
gender, yielding 245,700 prompts to evaluate 50 distinct bias patterns.
Focusing on harms of omission due to underrepresentation, we investigate bias
through the lens of uncertainty and propose a group (un)fairness metric called
Coreference Confidence Disparity which measures whether models are more or less
confident for some intersectional identities than others. We evaluate five
recently published LLMs and find confidence disparities as high as 40% along
various demographic attributes including body type, sexual orientation and
socio-economic status, with models being most uncertain about
doubly-disadvantaged identities in anti-stereotypical settings. Surprisingly,
coreference confidence decreases even for hegemonic or privileged markers,
indicating that the recent impressive performance of LLMs is more likely due to
memorization than logical reasoning. Notably, these are two independent
failures in value alignment and validity that can compound to cause social
harm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ASR系统中的偏见及其伦理影响，揭示其对语言多样性和社会公平的潜在危害。

Method: 通过哲学视角分析ASR偏见的伦理维度，区分技术分类与有害歧视，并探讨语言标准化与多元化的矛盾。

Result: 发现ASR偏见具有独特的伦理维度（如时间负担、对话中断和身份认同），现有技术指标难以衡量。

Conclusion: 解决ASR偏见需技术改进与对语言多样性的尊重相结合，以推动更公平的系统设计。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems now mediate countless
human-technology interactions, yet research on their fairness implications
remains surprisingly limited. This paper examines ASR bias through a
philosophical lens, arguing that systematic misrecognition of certain speech
varieties constitutes more than a technical limitation -- it represents a form
of disrespect that compounds historical injustices against marginalized
linguistic communities. We distinguish between morally neutral classification
(discriminate1) and harmful discrimination (discriminate2), demonstrating how
ASR systems can inadvertently transform the former into the latter when they
consistently misrecognize non-standard dialects. We identify three unique
ethical dimensions of speech technologies that differentiate ASR bias from
other algorithmic fairness concerns: the temporal burden placed on speakers of
non-standard varieties ("temporal taxation"), the disruption of conversational
flow when systems misrecognize speech, and the fundamental connection between
speech patterns and personal/cultural identity. These factors create asymmetric
power relationships that existing technical fairness metrics fail to capture.
The paper analyzes the tension between linguistic standardization and pluralism
in ASR development, arguing that current approaches often embed and reinforce
problematic language ideologies. We conclude that addressing ASR bias requires
more than technical interventions; it demands recognition of diverse speech
varieties as legitimate forms of expression worthy of technological
accommodation. This philosophical reframing offers new pathways for developing
ASR systems that respect linguistic diversity and speaker autonomy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全微调方法在高有害比例下防御性能急剧下降，原因是用户任务梯度与安全目标梯度冲突。

Method: 提出SafeGrad方法，检测梯度冲突时，将用户任务梯度投影到对齐梯度的正交平面，并使用KL散度对齐损失增强鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，SafeGrad在各种LLM和数据集上提供最先进的防御，即使在高有害比例下也能保持安全性和任务性能。

Conclusion: SafeGrad有效解决了安全微调中的梯度冲突问题，为LLM的安全对齐提供了鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning-as-a-Service introduces a critical vulnerability where a few
malicious examples mixed into the user's fine-tuning dataset can compromise the
safety alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs). While a recognized paradigm
frames safe fine-tuning as a multi-objective optimization problem balancing
user task performance with safety alignment, we find existing solutions are
critically sensitive to the harmful ratio, with defenses degrading sharply as
harmful ratio increases. We diagnose that this failure stems from conflicting
gradients, where the user-task update directly undermines the safety objective.
To resolve this, we propose SafeGrad, a novel method that employs gradient
surgery. When a conflict is detected, SafeGrad nullifies the harmful component
of the user-task gradient by projecting it onto the orthogonal plane of the
alignment gradient, allowing the model to learn the user's task without
sacrificing safety. To further enhance robustness and data efficiency, we
employ a KL-divergence alignment loss that learns the rich, distributional
safety profile of the well-aligned foundation model. Extensive experiments show
that SafeGrad provides state-of-the-art defense across various LLMs and
datasets, maintaining robust safety even at high harmful ratios without
compromising task fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准无法评估OLLMs在视听联合输入或跨模态安全一致性方面的表现，亟需专门工具。

Method: 设计了包含24种模态组合的Omni-SafetyBench，提出基于条件攻击成功率（C-ASR）和拒绝率（C-RR）的安全评分（Safety-score）及跨模态安全一致性评分（CMSC-score）。

Result: 评估显示：1）无模型在整体安全性和一致性上表现优异；2）复杂输入（尤其是视听联合）削弱安全防御；3）部分模型在特定模态上评分低至0.14。

Conclusion: Omni-SafetyBench为未来改进OLLMs安全性提供了基础，凸显了增强安全性的紧迫性。

Abstract: The rise of Omni-modal Large Language Models (OLLMs), which integrate visual
and auditory processing with text, necessitates robust safety evaluations to
mitigate harmful outputs. However, no dedicated benchmarks currently exist for
OLLMs, and prior benchmarks designed for other LLMs lack the ability to assess
safety performance under audio-visual joint inputs or cross-modal safety
consistency. To fill this gap, we introduce Omni-SafetyBench, the first
comprehensive parallel benchmark for OLLM safety evaluation, featuring 24
modality combinations and variations with 972 samples each, including dedicated
audio-visual harm cases. Considering OLLMs' comprehension challenges with
complex omni-modal inputs and the need for cross-modal consistency evaluation,
we propose tailored metrics: a Safety-score based on conditional Attack Success
Rate (C-ASR) and Refusal Rate (C-RR) to account for comprehension failures, and
a Cross-Modal Safety Consistency Score (CMSC-score) to measure consistency
across modalities. Evaluating 6 open-source and 4 closed-source OLLMs reveals
critical vulnerabilities: (1) no model excels in both overall safety and
consistency, with only 3 models achieving over 0.6 in both metrics and top
performer scoring around 0.8; (2) safety defenses weaken with complex inputs,
especially audio-visual joints; (3) severe weaknesses persist, with some models
scoring as low as 0.14 on specific modalities. Our benchmark and metrics
highlight urgent needs for enhanced OLLM safety, providing a foundation for
future improvements.

Motivation: 现有方法忽略了历史点击流中的个性化无关噪声，导致标题偏离用户真实兴趣。

Method: 采用双阶段过滤去除噪声（短停留时间和异常点击），并结合多级时间融合动态建模用户兴趣。

Result: PHG-DIF在DT-PENS数据集上显著减少噪声影响，取得SOTA效果。

Conclusion: PHG-DIF有效提升个性化标题生成质量，并公开了数据集和实现代码。

Abstract: Accurate personalized headline generation hinges on precisely capturing user
interests from historical behaviors. However, existing methods neglect
personalized-irrelevant click noise in entire historical clickstreams, which
may lead to hallucinated headlines that deviate from genuine user preferences.
In this paper, we reveal the detrimental impact of click noise on personalized
generation quality through rigorous analysis in both user and news dimensions.
Based on these insights, we propose a novel Personalized Headline Generation
framework via Denoising Fake Interests from Implicit Feedback (PHG-DIF).
PHG-DIF first employs dual-stage filtering to effectively remove clickstream
noise, identified by short dwell times and abnormal click bursts, and then
leverages multi-level temporal fusion to dynamically model users' evolving and
multi-faceted interests for precise profiling. Moreover, we release DT-PENS, a
new benchmark dataset comprising the click behavior of 1,000 carefully curated
users and nearly 10,000 annotated personalized headlines with historical dwell
time annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PHG-DIF substantially
mitigates the adverse effects of click noise and significantly improves
headline quality, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on DT-PENS. Our
framework implementation and dataset are available at

Result: 实验表明，模型规模和提示技术影响性能，32B开源模型在标准提示下性能接近GPT系列。

Conclusion: 该框架为实际应用中部署模式感知代理提供了一种可扩展且经济的方法。

Abstract: Enterprise data pipelines, characterized by complex transformations across
multiple programming languages, often cause a semantic disconnect between
original metadata and downstream data. This "semantic drift" compromises data
reproducibility and governance, and impairs the utility of services like
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and text-to-SQL systems. To address this,
a novel framework is proposed for the automated extraction of fine-grained
schema lineage from multilingual enterprise pipeline scripts. This method
identifies four key components: source schemas, source tables, transformation
logic, and aggregation operations, creating a standardized representation of
data transformations. For the rigorous evaluation of lineage quality, this
paper introduces the Schema Lineage Composite Evaluation (SLiCE), a metric that
assesses both structural correctness and semantic fidelity. A new benchmark is
also presented, comprising 1,700 manually annotated lineages from real-world
industrial scripts. Experiments were conducted with 12 language models, from
1.3B to 32B small language models (SLMs) to large language models (LLMs) like
GPT-4o and GPT-4.1. The results demonstrate that the performance of schema
lineage extraction scales with model size and the sophistication of prompting
techniques. Specially, a 32B open-source model, using a single reasoning trace,
can achieve performance comparable to the GPT series under standard prompting.
This finding suggests a scalable and economical approach for deploying
schema-aware agents in practical applications.

Motivation: LLM的知识静态且易过时，重新训练成本高，现有知识编辑技术效率低且可能引入副作用。

Method: 结合动态KG和稀疏知识注意力机制，实现粗到细粒度搜索，高效筛选相关事实。

Result: 在时效性问答任务中，DySK-Attn在事实准确性和计算效率上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DySK-Attn为LLM提供了一种可扩展且高效的实时知识更新解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from a critical limitation: their
knowledge is static and quickly becomes outdated. Retraining these massive
models is computationally prohibitive, while existing knowledge editing
techniques can be slow and may introduce unforeseen side effects. To address
this, we propose DySK-Attn, a novel framework that enables LLMs to efficiently
integrate real-time knowledge from a dynamic external source. Our approach
synergizes an LLM with a dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG) that can be updated
instantaneously. The core of our framework is a sparse knowledge attention
mechanism, which allows the LLM to perform a coarse-to-fine grained search,
efficiently identifying and focusing on a small, highly relevant subset of
facts from the vast KG. This mechanism avoids the high computational cost of
dense attention over the entire knowledge base and mitigates noise from
irrelevant information. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on
time-sensitive question-answering tasks that DySK-Attn significantly
outperforms strong baselines, including standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) and model editing techniques, in both factual accuracy for updated
knowledge and computational efficiency. Our framework offers a scalable and
effective solution for building LLMs that can stay current with the
ever-changing world.

Result: 在七个基准测试中，TALON平均MSE提升11%，表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TALON通过模式感知和语义感知设计，成功将LLM应用于时间序列预测。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive
capabilities in natural language processing due to their strong generalization
and sequence modeling capabilities. However, their direct application to time
series forecasting remains challenging due to two fundamental issues: the
inherent heterogeneity of temporal patterns and the modality gap between
continuous numerical signals and discrete language representations. In this
work, we propose TALON, a unified framework that enhances LLM-based forecasting
by modeling temporal heterogeneity and enforcing semantic alignment.
Specifically, we design a Heterogeneous Temporal Encoder that partitions
multivariate time series into structurally coherent segments, enabling
localized expert modeling across diverse temporal patterns. To bridge the
modality gap, we introduce a Semantic Alignment Module that aligns temporal
features with LLM-compatible representations, enabling effective integration of
time series into language-based models while eliminating the need for
handcrafted prompts during inference. Extensive experiments on seven real-world
benchmarks demonstrate that TALON achieves superior performance across all
datasets, with average MSE improvements of up to 11\% over recent
state-of-the-art methods. These results underscore the effectiveness of
incorporating both pattern-aware and semantic-aware designs when adapting LLMs
for time series forecasting. The code is available at:

### [259] [Enhancing Rumor Detection Methods with Propagation Structure Infused Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07209)
*Chaoqun Cui,Siyuan Li,Kunkun Ma,Caiyan Jia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PEP的继续预训练策略，通过预测帖子间的传播关系来提升PLM在谣言检测任务中的表现，并发布了相关数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PLM在社交媒体任务（如谣言检测）中表现不佳，原因包括预训练语料与社交媒体文本不匹配、未能有效处理社交媒体符号，以及预训练任务未建模传播结构中的用户互动。

Method: 提出PEP策略，通过预测帖子间的根、分支和父关系来捕捉传播结构中的互动信息，并训练了专门针对Twitter的PLM（SoLM）。

Result: PEP显著提升了PLM在谣言检测中的性能，基准数据集上准确率提升1.0-3.7%，甚至超越现有最优方法。SoLM也取得了竞争性结果。

Conclusion: PEP策略能有效学习帖子互动的判别性特征，为社交媒体任务提供了改进PLM性能的新方向。

Abstract: Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) have excelled in various Natural Language
Processing tasks, benefiting from large-scale pretraining and self-attention
mechanism's ability to capture long-range dependencies. However, their
performance on social media application tasks like rumor detection remains
suboptimal. We attribute this to mismatches between pretraining corpora and
social texts, inadequate handling of unique social symbols, and pretraining
tasks ill-suited for modeling user engagements implicit in propagation
structures. To address these issues, we propose a continue pretraining strategy
called Post Engagement Prediction (PEP) to infuse information from propagation
structures into PLMs. PEP makes models to predict root, branch, and parent
relations between posts, capturing interactions of stance and sentiment crucial
for rumor detection. We also curate and release large-scale Twitter corpus:
TwitterCorpus (269GB text), and two unlabeled claim conversation datasets with
propagation structures (UTwitter and UWeibo). Utilizing these resources and PEP
strategy, we train a Twitter-tailored PLM called SoLM. Extensive experiments
demonstrate PEP significantly boosts rumor detection performance across
universal and social media PLMs, even in few-shot scenarios. On benchmark
datasets, PEP enhances baseline models by 1.0-3.7\% accuracy, even enabling it
to outperform current state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets. SoLM
alone, without high-level modules, also achieves competitive results,
highlighting the strategy's effectiveness in learning discriminative post
interaction features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络在语音处理中表现优异，但其决策过程缺乏可解释性，尤其是在词汇重音预测中。

Method: 使用CNN架构从频谱图中预测英语双音节词的重音位置，并采用LRP技术分析模型决策依据。

Result: 模型在测试数据上达到92%准确率，LRP显示重音音节的频谱特性（如第一和第二共振峰）对预测影响最大。

Conclusion: 深度学习能从自然数据中学习分布式的重音线索，扩展了传统语音学研究的范围。

Abstract: Despite their success in speech processing, neural networks often operate as
black boxes, prompting the question: what informs their decisions, and how can
we interpret them? This work examines this issue in the context of lexical
stress. A dataset of English disyllabic words was automatically constructed
from read and spontaneous speech. Several Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
architectures were trained to predict stress position from a spectrographic
representation of disyllabic words lacking minimal stress pairs (e.g., initial
stress WAllet, final stress exTEND), achieving up to 92% accuracy on held-out
test data. Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP), a technique for CNN
interpretability analysis, revealed that predictions for held-out minimal pairs
(PROtest vs. proTEST ) were most strongly influenced by information in stressed
versus unstressed syllables, particularly the spectral properties of stressed
vowels. However, the classifiers also attended to information throughout the
word. A feature-specific relevance analysis is proposed, and its results
suggest that our best-performing classifier is strongly influenced by the
stressed vowel's first and second formants, with some evidence that its pitch
and third formant also contribute. These results reveal deep learning's ability
to acquire distributed cues to stress from naturally occurring data, extending
traditional phonetic work based around highly controlled stimuli.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在少样本持续学习命名实体识别（FS-CLNER）任务中，新类别实体稀缺导致模型泛化能力差，且旧类别信息不足引发蒸馏困境。

Method: 设计了可扩展的锚词导向提示调优（APT）范式，结合记忆演示模板（MDT）提供历史任务样本，以增强少样本场景下的性能。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在FS-CLNER任务中取得了竞争性表现。

Conclusion: 通过提示调优和记忆演示模板，有效解决了少样本蒸馏困境，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation has been successfully applied to Continual Learning
Named Entity Recognition (CLNER) tasks, by using a teacher model trained on
old-class data to distill old-class entities present in new-class data as a
form of regularization, thereby avoiding catastrophic forgetting. However, in
Few-Shot CLNER (FS-CLNER) tasks, the scarcity of new-class entities makes it
difficult for the trained model to generalize during inference. More
critically, the lack of old-class entity information hinders the distillation
of old knowledge, causing the model to fall into what we refer to as the
Few-Shot Distillation Dilemma. In this work, we address the above challenges
through a prompt tuning paradigm and memory demonstration template strategy.
Specifically, we designed an expandable Anchor words-oriented Prompt Tuning
(APT) paradigm to bridge the gap between pre-training and fine-tuning, thereby
enhancing performance in few-shot scenarios. Additionally, we incorporated
Memory Demonstration Templates (MDT) into each training instance to provide
replay samples from previous tasks, which not only avoids the Few-Shot
Distillation Dilemma but also promotes in-context learning. Experiments show
that our approach achieves competitive performances on FS-CLNER.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进发音模型以更准确地模拟舌-腭接触，为语音科学教育和治疗提供工具。

Method: 实现两种腭穹几何形状（半椭圆和余弦曲线），计算侧向接触点，生成类似电腭图的2D+可视化。

Result: 增强模型支持三视图同步显示（矢状、声门和腭部），适用于静态和动态发音展示。

Conclusion: 未来将增加面部视图并实现发音-声学合成，以定量评估模型真实性。

Abstract: This paper describes an extension of the two-dimensional dynamic articulatory
model DYNARTmo by integrating an internal three-dimensional representation of
the palatal dome to estimate tongue-palate contact areas from midsagittal
tongue contours. Two alternative dome geometries - a half-ellipse and a cosine
based profile - are implemented to model lateral curvature in the coronal
plane. Using these geometries, lateral contact points are analytically computed
for each anterior-posterior position, enabling the generation of
electropalatography-like visualizations within the 2D+ framework. The enhanced
model supports three synchronized views (sagittal, glottal, and palatal) for
static and dynamic (animated) articulation displays, suitable for speech
science education and speech therapy. Future work includes adding a facial
(lip) view and implementing articulatory-to-acoustic synthesis to
quantitatively evaluate model realism.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种方法（显式和隐式）将副语言信息融入语音大语言模型训练，显著提升了模型在共情推理上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音大语言模型在共情推理上表现不足，主要因缺乏结合上下文内容和副语言线索的训练数据。

Method: 1. 显式方法：直接提供副语言元数据（如情感标注）给模型；2. 隐式方法：自动生成结合情感标注和语音转录的训练QA对。

Result: 隐式方法在人类标注QA基准上性能提升38.41%，结合显式方法后达46.02%。LLM评判结果与分类指标相关，验证其可靠性。

Conclusion: 两种方法有效提升模型对上下文副语言的理解能力，为共情推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Current large speech language models (Speech-LLMs) often exhibit limitations
in empathetic reasoning, primarily due to the absence of training datasets that
integrate both contextual content and paralinguistic cues. In this work, we
propose two approaches to incorporate contextual paralinguistic information
into model training: (1) an explicit method that provides paralinguistic
metadata (e.g., emotion annotations) directly to the LLM, and (2) an implicit
method that automatically generates novel training question-answer (QA) pairs
using both categorical and dimensional emotion annotations alongside speech
transcriptions. Our implicit method boosts performance (LLM-judged) by 38.41%
on a human-annotated QA benchmark, reaching 46.02% when combined with the
explicit approach, showing effectiveness in contextual paralinguistic
understanding. We also validate the LLM judge by demonstrating its correlation
with classification metrics, providing support for its reliability.

TL;DR: MAQuA是一种自适应提问框架，通过结合多结果建模、IRT和因子分析，优化心理健康筛查问题选择，显著减少问题数量并提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用大型语言模型（LLMs）进行心理健康评估时，过度提问会增加用户负担且效率低下，因此需要一种更高效的自适应方法。

Method: 结合多结果建模、项目反应理论（IRT）和因子分析，动态选择最具信息量的问题，优化诊断信息。

Result: MAQuA将评估问题数量减少50-87%，在抑郁和饮食障碍等领域表现稳健，显著降低用户负担。

Conclusion: MAQuA是一种高效、可扩展的心理健康筛查工具，有助于LLM在临床工作流程中的实际应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for
scalable, interactive mental health assessment, but excessive querying by LLMs
burdens users and is inefficient for real-world screening across
transdiagnostic symptom profiles. We introduce MAQuA, an adaptive
question-asking framework for simultaneous, multidimensional mental health
screening. Combining multi-outcome modeling on language responses with item
response theory (IRT) and factor analysis, MAQuA selects the questions with
most informative responses across multiple dimensions at each turn to optimize
diagnostic information, improving accuracy and potentially reducing response
burden. Empirical results on a novel dataset reveal that MAQuA reduces the
number of assessment questions required for score stabilization by 50-87%
compared to random ordering (e.g., achieving stable depression scores with 71%
fewer questions and eating disorder scores with 85% fewer questions). MAQuA
demonstrates robust performance across both internalizing (depression, anxiety)
and externalizing (substance use, eating disorder) domains, with early stopping
strategies further reducing patient time and burden. These findings position
MAQuA as a powerful and efficient tool for scalable, nuanced, and interactive
mental health screening, advancing the integration of LLM-based agents into
real-world clinical workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs越来越多地参与伦理敏感决策，理解其道德推理过程变得至关重要。

Method: 通过因子提示协议，收集了3,780个二元决策和自然语言解释，分析了决策果断性、解释一致性、公共道德对齐及对无关伦理线索的敏感性。

Result: 研究发现，增强推理模型更果断且解释更结构化，但并非总是更符合人类共识；在利他主义、公平和美德伦理框架下表现最佳，而在亲属关系、法律或自利框架下易产生争议结果。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁将道德推理作为LLM对齐的主要维度，并建立标准化基准以评估其决策逻辑。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate ethically sensitive
decisions, understanding their moral reasoning processes becomes imperative.
This study presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation of 14 leading LLMs,
both reasoning enabled and general purpose, across 27 diverse trolley problem
scenarios, framed by ten moral philosophies, including utilitarianism,
deontology, and altruism. Using a factorial prompting protocol, we elicited
3,780 binary decisions and natural language justifications, enabling analysis
along axes of decisional assertiveness, explanation answer consistency, public
moral alignment, and sensitivity to ethically irrelevant cues. Our findings
reveal significant variability across ethical frames and model types: reasoning
enhanced models demonstrate greater decisiveness and structured justifications,
yet do not always align better with human consensus. Notably, "sweet zones"
emerge in altruistic, fairness, and virtue ethics framings, where models
achieve a balance of high intervention rates, low explanation conflict, and
minimal divergence from aggregated human judgments. However, models diverge
under frames emphasizing kinship, legality, or self interest, often producing
ethically controversial outcomes. These patterns suggest that moral prompting
is not only a behavioral modifier but also a diagnostic tool for uncovering
latent alignment philosophies across providers. We advocate for moral reasoning
to become a primary axis in LLM alignment, calling for standardized benchmarks
that evaluate not just what LLMs decide, but how and why.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注英语文本或视觉模态，缺乏对多语言语音输入的事实性评估，因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 设计了包含8种语言的并行语音-文本事实性问题的CCFQA基准，并提出少样本迁移学习策略，将英语问答能力迁移到多语言语音问答任务。

Result: 实验显示当前MLLMs在CCFQA基准上表现不佳，但提出的少样本策略在仅5次训练后达到与GPT-4o-mini-Audio竞争的性能。

Conclusion: CCFQA为促进MLLMs在多语言语音理解能力上的发展提供了基础研究资源。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly popularized in the
multilingual world, ensuring hallucination-free factuality becomes markedly
crucial. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating the reliability of
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) predominantly focus on textual or
visual modalities with a primary emphasis on English, which creates a gap in
evaluation when processing multilingual input, especially in speech. To bridge
this gap, we propose a novel \textbf{C}ross-lingual and \textbf{C}ross-modal
\textbf{F}actuality benchmark (\textbf{CCFQA}). Specifically, the CCFQA
benchmark contains parallel speech-text factual questions across 8 languages,
designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs' cross-lingual and cross-modal
factuality capabilities. Our experimental results demonstrate that current
MLLMs still face substantial challenges on the CCFQA benchmark. Furthermore, we
propose a few-shot transfer learning strategy that effectively transfers the
Question Answering (QA) capabilities of LLMs in English to multilingual Spoken
Question Answering (SQA) tasks, achieving competitive performance with
GPT-4o-mini-Audio using just 5-shot training. We release CCFQA as a
foundational research resource to promote the development of MLLMs with more
robust and reliable speech understanding capabilities. Our code and dataset are

Motivation: 现有研究未测试LLMs在面对模糊化问题时的表现，因此需要系统评估其局限性。

Method: 提出ObfusQAte技术，并构建ObfusQA框架，通过三个维度（命名实体间接、干扰项间接、上下文过载）评估LLMs。

Result: LLMs在面对复杂语言变化时容易失败或产生幻觉回答。

Conclusion: ObfusQA为评估LLMs的鲁棒性和适应性提供了全面基准，并公开了ObfusQAte以促进相关研究。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly
contributed to the development of equitable AI systems capable of factual
question-answering (QA). However, no known study tests the LLMs' robustness
when presented with obfuscated versions of questions. To systematically
evaluate these limitations, we propose a novel technique, ObfusQAte and,
leveraging the same, introduce ObfusQA, a comprehensive, first of its kind,
framework with multi-tiered obfuscation levels designed to examine LLM
capabilities across three distinct dimensions: (i) Named-Entity Indirection,
(ii) Distractor Indirection, and (iii) Contextual Overload. By capturing these
fine-grained distinctions in language, ObfusQA provides a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating LLM robustness and adaptability. Our study observes
that LLMs exhibit a tendency to fail or generate hallucinated responses when
confronted with these increasingly nuanced variations. To foster research in
this direction, we make ObfusQAte publicly available.

Motivation: 理解代码切换语言的特征及其对双语使用的影响。

Method: 开发能完成地图任务的聊天机器人，采用不同代码切换策略进行实验。

Result: 参与者更喜欢可预测的代码切换行为，随机或不规范的切换会降低任务完成度和满意度。

Conclusion: 未充分开发的多语言技术可能带来负面影响，但此类技术对双语研究具有潜力。

Abstract: Most people are multilingual, and most multilinguals code-switch, yet the
characteristics of code-switched language are not fully understood. We
developed a chatbot capable of completing a Map Task with human participants
using code-switched Spanish and English. In two experiments, we prompted the
bot to code-switch according to different strategies, examining (1) the
feasibility of such experiments for investigating bilingual language use, and
(2) whether participants would be sensitive to variations in discourse and
grammatical patterns. Participants generally enjoyed code-switching with our
bot as long as it produced predictable code-switching behavior; when
code-switching was random or ungrammatical (as when producing unattested
incongruent mixed-language noun phrases, such as `la fork'), participants
enjoyed the task less and were less successful at completing it. These results
underscore the potential downsides of deploying insufficiently developed
multilingual language technology, while also illustrating the promise of such
technology for conducting research on bilingual language use.

Conclusion: TurnGuide有效解决了FD-SLMs的关键挑战，提升了语音交互的自然性和质量。

Abstract: Full-Duplex Speech Language Models (FD-SLMs) are specialized foundation
models designed to enable natural, real-time spoken interactions by modeling
complex conversational dynamics such as interruptions, backchannels, and
overlapping speech, and End-to-end (e2e) FD-SLMs leverage real-world
double-channel conversational data to capture nuanced two-speaker dialogue
patterns for human-like interactions. However, they face a critical challenge
-- their conversational abilities often degrade compared to pure-text
conversation due to prolonged speech sequences and limited high-quality spoken
dialogue data. While text-guided speech generation could mitigate these issues,
it suffers from timing and length issues when integrating textual guidance into
double-channel audio streams, disrupting the precise time alignment essential
for natural interactions. To address these challenges, we propose TurnGuide, a
novel planning-inspired approach that mimics human conversational planning by
dynamically segmenting assistant speech into dialogue turns and generating
turn-level text guidance before speech output, which effectively resolves both
insertion timing and length challenges. Extensive experiments demonstrate our
approach significantly improves e2e FD-SLMs' conversational abilities, enabling
them to generate semantically meaningful and coherent speech while maintaining
natural conversational flow. Demos are available at

Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在低资源语言和文化实体上的表现不佳问题。

Result: CulturalPangea在文化相关任务中表现优异，平均提升5.0分，且不影响主流任务性能。

Conclusion: 文化驱动的数据方法能有效缩小多模态模型的文化差距，推动全球包容性系统发展。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models excel in high-resource settings, but often
misinterpret long-tail cultural entities and underperform in low-resource
languages. To address this gap, we propose a data-centric approach that
directly grounds MLLMs in cultural knowledge. Leveraging a large scale
knowledge graph from Wikidata, we collect images that represent culturally
significant entities, and generate synthetic multilingual visual question
answering data. The resulting dataset, CulturalGround, comprises 22 million
high-quality, culturally-rich VQA pairs spanning 42 countries and 39 languages.
We train an open-source MLLM CulturalPangea on CulturalGround, interleaving
standard multilingual instruction-tuning data to preserve general abilities.
CulturalPangea achieves state-of-the-art performance among open models on
various culture-focused multilingual multimodal benchmarks, outperforming prior
models by an average of 5.0 without degrading results on mainstream
vision-language tasks. Our findings show that our targeted, culturally grounded
approach could substantially narrow the cultural gap in MLLMs and offer a
practical path towards globally inclusive multimodal systems.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在代码生成中的效率和可扩展性问题，尤其是树搜索方法的高消耗和改进方法的不稳定性。

Method: 提出ReLoc框架，包含初始代码起草、邻域代码生成、候选评估和代码更新四个组件，并开发修订奖励模型。

Result: 实验表明，ReLoc在多种代码生成任务中表现优异，超越现有方法。

Conclusion: ReLoc为代码生成提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with inference-time scaling techniques show
promise for code generation, yet face notable efficiency and scalability
challenges. Construction-based tree-search methods suffer from rapid growth in
tree size, high token consumption, and lack of anytime property. In contrast,
improvement-based methods offer better performance but often struggle with
uninformative reward signals and inefficient search strategies. In this work,
we propose \textbf{ReLoc}, a unified local search framework which effectively
performs step-by-step code revision. Specifically, ReLoc explores a series of
local revisions through four key algorithmic components: initial code drafting,
neighborhood code generation, candidate evaluation, and incumbent code
updating, each of which can be instantiated with specific decision rules to
realize different local search algorithms such as Hill Climbing (HC) or Genetic
Algorithm (GA). Furthermore, we develop a specialized revision reward model
that evaluates code quality based on revision distance to produce fine-grained
preferences that guide the local search toward more promising candidates.
Finally, our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach
achieves superior performance across diverse code generation tasks,
significantly outperforming both construction-based tree search as well as the
state-of-the-art improvement-based code generation methods.

TL;DR: 研究发现，大语言模型（LLM）在长输入中存在位置偏差，如“中间迷失”效应（LiM），但该效应在输入长度超过模型上下文窗口50%时减弱，转为距离偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM在长输入中的位置偏差（如LiM效应）及其表现条件，以优化长上下文任务和评估方法。

Method: 通过相对输入长度（相对于模型上下文窗口）进行综合分析。

Result: LiM效应在输入占窗口50%时最强；超过后，首因偏差减弱，近因偏差稳定，转为距离偏差。检索是推理的前提，位置偏差主要源于检索。

Conclusion: 研究为长上下文任务设计、LLM基准和评估方法提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to use information across long
inputs effectively. Prior work has identified positional biases, such as the
Lost in the Middle (LiM) effect, where models perform better when information
appears at the beginning (primacy bias) or end (recency bias) of the input,
rather than in the middle. However, long-context studies have not consistently
replicated these effects, raising questions about their intensity and the
conditions under which they manifest. To address this, we conducted a
comprehensive analysis using relative rather than absolute input lengths,
defined with respect to each model's context window. Our findings reveal that
the LiM effect is strongest when inputs occupy up to 50% of a model's context
window. Beyond that, the primacy bias weakens, while recency bias remains
relatively stable. This effectively eliminates the LiM effect; instead, we
observe a distance-based bias, where model performance is better when relevant
information is closer to the end of the input. Furthermore, our results suggest
that successful retrieval is a prerequisite for reasoning in LLMs, and that the
observed positional biases in reasoning are largely inherited from retrieval.
These insights have implications for long-context tasks, the design of future
LLM benchmarks, and evaluation methodologies for LLMs handling extended inputs.

*Archchana Sindhujan,Shenbin Qian,Chan Chi Chun Matthew,Constantin Orasan,Diptesh Kanojia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ALOPE是一个自适应层优化框架，通过调整Transformer层的表示来提升基于LLM的机器翻译质量估计（QE）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的QE系统因预训练目标和低资源语言问题表现不佳，需改进。

Method: ALOPE结合低秩适配器（LoRA）和回归任务头，动态加权和多头回归策略优化层表示。

Result: ALOPE在多种LLM-based QE方法中表现更优，中间层表示更适合跨语言任务。

Conclusion: ALOPE为LLM-based QE提供了有效改进，并公开了模型和代码以促进研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across a wide
range of natural language processing tasks. Quality Estimation (QE) for Machine
Translation (MT), which assesses the quality of a source-target pair without
relying on reference translations, remains a challenging cross-lingual task for
LLMs. The challenges stem from the inherent limitations of existing LLM-based
QE systems, which are pre-trained for causal language modelling rather than
regression-specific tasks, further elevated by the presence of low-resource
languages given pre-training data distribution. This paper introduces ALOPE, an
adaptive layer-optimization framework designed to enhance LLM-based QE by
restructuring Transformer representations through layer-wise adaptation for
improved regression-based prediction. Our framework integrates low-rank
adapters (LoRA) with regression task heads, leveraging selected pre-trained
Transformer layers for improved cross-lingual alignment. In addition to the
layer-specific adaptation, ALOPE introduces two strategies-dynamic weighting,
which adaptively combines representations from multiple layers, and multi-head
regression, which aggregates regression losses from multiple heads for QE. Our
framework shows improvements over various existing LLM-based QE approaches.
Empirical evidence suggests that intermediate Transformer layers in LLMs
provide contextual representations that are more aligned with the cross-lingual
nature of the QE task. We make resultant models and framework code publicly
available for further research, also allowing existing LLM-based MT frameworks
to be scaled with QE capabilities.

*Keshav Varadarajan,Tananun Songdechakraiwut*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于拓扑数据分析的方法，用于识别GPT-2中导致对特定身份群体偏见的注意力头。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法虽能检测大型语言模型的偏见，但尚未明确模型中哪些部分对特定群体偏见负责。

Method: 使用拓扑数据分析技术，定位GPT-2中导致StereoSet数据集中身份群体误表征的注意力头。

Result: 发现性别或职业等特定类别的偏见集中在某些热点注意力头中。

Conclusion: 提出的指标可用于识别特定群体的偏见头，未来可扩展用于去偏大型语言模型。

Abstract: Recently, many bias detection methods have been proposed to determine the
level of bias a large language model captures. However, tests to identify which
parts of a large language model are responsible for bias towards specific
groups remain underdeveloped. In this study, we present a method using
topological data analysis to identify which heads in GPT-2 contribute to the
misrepresentation of identity groups present in the StereoSet dataset. We find
that biases for particular categories, such as gender or profession, are
concentrated in attention heads that act as hot spots. The metric we propose
can also be used to determine which heads capture bias for a specific group
within a bias category, and future work could extend this method to help
de-bias large language models.

*Joseph T. Colonel,Baihan Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ThemeClouds是一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的开源可视化工具，用于从对话转录中生成主题词云，解决了传统频率词云在对话语境中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统频率词云在对话语境中效果不佳，无法捕捉语义相关的内容，限制了其在早期研究分析中的实用性。

Method: 利用LLM识别语料库中的概念级主题，并统计每个主题被多少独特参与者提及，生成基于提及广度的词云。

Result: ThemeClouds在用户研究中比频率词云和主题建模基线（如LDA、BERTopic）更能揭示可操作的设备问题。

Conclusion: ThemeClouds为定性工作流提供了更透明、可控的LLM辅助方法，并支持交互式分析。

Abstract: Word clouds are a common way to summarize qualitative interviews, yet
traditional frequency-based methods often fail in conversational contexts: they
surface filler words, ignore paraphrase, and fragment semantically related
ideas. This limits their usefulness in early-stage analysis, when researchers
need fast, interpretable overviews of what participant actually said. We
introduce ThemeClouds, an open-source visualization tool that uses large
language models (LLMs) to generate thematic, participant-weighted word clouds
from dialogue transcripts. The system prompts an LLM to identify concept-level
themes across a corpus and then counts how many unique participants mention
each topic, yielding a visualization grounded in breadth of mention rather than
raw term frequency. Researchers can customize prompts and visualization
parameters, providing transparency and control. Using interviews from a user
study comparing five recording-device configurations (31 participants; 155
transcripts, Whisper ASR), our approach surfaces more actionable device
concerns than frequency clouds and topic-modeling baselines (e.g., LDA,
BERTopic). We discuss design trade-offs for integrating LLM assistance into
qualitative workflows, implications for interpretability and researcher agency,
and opportunities for interactive analyses such as per-condition contrasts
(``diff clouds'').

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了RLVR中LLMs的探索能力，包括探索空间塑造、熵-性能交换和RL性能优化，旨在为RLVR系统提供基础框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL方法在LLMs的复杂推理链生成和优化中依赖规则反馈，但探索行为的机制尚未深入研究。

Method: 研究探索空间塑造、熵-性能交换及RL性能优化，结合定量指标和实证分析。

Result: 提出了量化LLMs能力边界的指标，分析了熵与性能的关系，并探索了提升RL性能的方法。

Conclusion: 本研究为RLVR系统的进一步发展提供了理论基础和实证支持。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). Unlike traditional RL approaches, RLVR leverages rule-based
feedback to guide LLMs in generating and refining complex reasoning chains -- a
process critically dependent on effective exploration strategies. While prior
work has demonstrated RLVR's empirical success, the fundamental mechanisms
governing LLMs' exploration behaviors remain underexplored. This technical
report presents a systematic investigation of exploration capacities in RLVR,
covering four main aspects: (1) exploration space shaping, where we develop
quantitative metrics to characterize LLMs' capability boundaries; (2)
entropy-performance exchange, analyzed across training stages, individual
instances, and token-level patterns; and (3) RL performance optimization,
examining methods to effectively translate exploration gains into measurable
improvements. By unifying previously identified insights with new empirical
evidence, this work aims to provide a foundational framework for advancing RLVR
systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了印度保释预测系统（IBPS），一个基于AI的框架，旨在通过预测保释结果和生成法律依据来辅助保释决策，以减少主观性和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度法院的保释决策存在主观性、延迟和不一致问题，75%的监狱人口为未决囚犯，加剧了人权问题和司法积压。

Method: 利用150,430份高等法院保释判决数据集，结合结构化注释，通过参数高效技术微调大型语言模型，并评估其性能。

Result: 结果显示，结合法律知识的模型显著优于基线，具有高准确性和解释质量，并能泛化到专家注释的测试集。

Conclusion: IBPS为印度司法系统提供了透明、可扩展的解决方案，支持数据驱动的法律辅助，减少保释延迟，促进程序公平。

Abstract: Bail decisions are among the most frequently adjudicated matters in Indian
courts, yet they remain plagued by subjectivity, delays, and inconsistencies.
With over 75% of India's prison population comprising undertrial prisoners,
many from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds, the lack of timely and
fair bail adjudication exacerbates human rights concerns and contributes to
systemic judicial backlog. In this paper, we present the Indian Bail Prediction
System (IBPS), an AI-powered framework designed to assist in bail
decision-making by predicting outcomes and generating legally sound rationales
based solely on factual case attributes and statutory provisions. We curate and
release a large-scale dataset of 150,430 High Court bail judgments, enriched
with structured annotations such as age, health, criminal history, crime
category, custody duration, statutes, and judicial reasoning. We fine-tune a
large language model using parameter-efficient techniques and evaluate its
performance across multiple configurations, with and without statutory context,
and with RAG. Our results demonstrate that models fine-tuned with statutory
knowledge significantly outperform baselines, achieving strong accuracy and
explanation quality, and generalize well to a test set independently annotated
by legal experts. IBPS offers a transparent, scalable, and reproducible
solution to support data-driven legal assistance, reduce bail delays, and
promote procedural fairness in the Indian judicial system.

*Ziheng Li,Zhi-Hong Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出KeyCP++方法，通过关键词链式思维提示改进LLM在事件检测中的表现，解决传统ICL的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在事件检测中因对触发词理解不准确和过度解释而表现不佳，传统ICL无法有效纠正。

Method: 提出KeyCP++，通过自动标注输入文本与检测结果间的逻辑差距，构建触发词判别提示模板，结合关键词生成候选触发词并验证。

Result: 实验证明KeyCP++在单样本事件检测中显著提升性能。

Conclusion: KeyCP++通过关键词链式思维提示有效改进LLM的事件检测能力。

Abstract: Although the LLM-based in-context learning (ICL) paradigm has demonstrated
considerable success across various natural language processing tasks, it
encounters challenges in event detection. This is because LLMs lack an accurate
understanding of event triggers and tend to make over-interpretation, which
cannot be effectively corrected through in-context examples alone. In this
paper, we focus on the most challenging one-shot setting and propose KeyCP++, a
keyword-centric chain-of-thought prompting approach. KeyCP++ addresses the
weaknesses of conventional ICL by automatically annotating the logical gaps
between input text and detection results for the demonstrations. Specifically,
to generate in-depth and meaningful rationale, KeyCP++ constructs a trigger
discrimination prompting template. It incorporates the exemplary triggers
(a.k.a keywords) into the prompt as the anchor to simply trigger profiling, let
LLM propose candidate triggers, and justify each candidate. These
propose-and-judge rationales help LLMs mitigate over-reliance on the keywords
and promote detection rule learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, showcasing significant advancements in one-shot
event detection.

TL;DR: InterChart是一个评估视觉-语言模型在多图表推理能力的诊断基准，涵盖从简单事实推理到复杂语义推理的多个难度层级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准多关注单一图表，而实际应用（如科学报告、金融分析）需要模型在多图表间进行复杂推理，因此需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: InterChart分为三个难度层级：单图表事实推理、合成对齐图表集综合分析、真实复杂图表对的语义推理。

Result: 实验表明，现有模型在多图表复杂度增加时准确率显著下降，但将复杂图表分解为简单单元可提升性能。

Conclusion: InterChart揭示了模型在多图表集成推理中的局限性，为复杂多视觉环境中的多模态推理研究提供了框架。

Abstract: We introduce InterChart, a diagnostic benchmark that evaluates how well
vision-language models (VLMs) reason across multiple related charts, a task
central to real-world applications such as scientific reporting, financial
analysis, and public policy dashboards. Unlike prior benchmarks focusing on
isolated, visually uniform charts, InterChart challenges models with diverse
question types ranging from entity inference and trend correlation to numerical
estimation and abstract multi-step reasoning grounded in 2-3 thematically or
structurally related charts. We organize the benchmark into three tiers of
increasing difficulty: (1) factual reasoning over individual charts, (2)
integrative analysis across synthetically aligned chart sets, and (3) semantic
inference over visually complex, real-world chart pairs. Our evaluation of
state-of-the-art open and closed-source VLMs reveals consistent and steep
accuracy declines as chart complexity increases. We find that models perform
better when we decompose multi-entity charts into simpler visual units,
underscoring their struggles with cross-chart integration. By exposing these
systematic limitations, InterChart provides a rigorous framework for advancing
multimodal reasoning in complex, multi-visual environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LoSemB的逻辑引导语义桥接框架，用于解决大语言模型在处理未见工具时的分布偏移和相似性检索脆弱性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中工具库不断更新，现有方法在训练时未见的工具上表现不佳，存在分布偏移和相似性检索脆弱性问题。

Method: LoSemB框架包含逻辑嵌入对齐模块和关系增强检索机制，以挖掘和转移潜在逻辑信息，无需重新训练。

Result: 实验表明，LoSemB在归纳设置中表现优异，同时在转导设置中保持良好效果。

Conclusion: LoSemB通过逻辑引导的语义桥接，有效解决了未见工具检索的问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Tool learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for large language models
(LLMs) to solve many real-world tasks. Nonetheless, with the tool repository
rapidly expanding, it is impractical to contain all tools within the limited
input length of LLMs. To alleviate these issues, researchers have explored
incorporating a tool retrieval module to select the most relevant tools or
represent tools as unique tokens within LLM parameters. However, most
state-of-the-art methods are under transductive settings, assuming all tools
have been observed during training. Such a setting deviates from reality as the
real-world tool repository is evolving and incorporates new tools frequently.
When dealing with these unseen tools, which refer to tools not encountered
during the training phase, these methods are limited by two key issues,
including the large distribution shift and the vulnerability of
similarity-based retrieval. To this end, inspired by human cognitive processes
of mastering unseen tools through discovering and applying the logical
information from prior experience, we introduce a novel Logic-Guided Semantic
Bridging framework for inductive tool retrieval, namely, LoSemB, which aims to
mine and transfer latent logical information for inductive tool retrieval
without costly retraining. Specifically, LoSemB contains a logic-based
embedding alignment module to mitigate distribution shifts and implements a
relational augmented retrieval mechanism to reduce the vulnerability of
similarity-based retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoSemB
achieves advanced performance in inductive settings while maintaining desirable
effectiveness in the transductive setting.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了基于Transformer的模型在预测长上下文（如完整句子）时的局限性，并提出Masked Sentence Prediction（MSP）任务评估商业LLM的表现，发现其在低结构化领域表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究NTP（Next Token Prediction）在长距离连贯性和全局一致性上的不足，探索LLM在预测完整句子时的能力。

Method: 评估GPT-4o、Claude 3.5 Sonnet和Gemini 2.0 Flash在MSP任务中的表现，测试领域包括叙事、程序和说明性文本。

Result: 商业LLM在低结构化领域的MSP任务中表现不佳，揭示了当前模型的局限性。

Conclusion: NTP的局限性导致LLM在长距离连贯性任务中表现不足，需进一步改进模型能力。

Abstract: Transformer-based models primarily rely on Next Token Prediction (NTP), which
predicts the next token in a sequence based on the preceding context. However,
NTP's focus on single-token prediction often limits a model's ability to plan
ahead or maintain long-range coherence, raising questions about how well LLMs
can predict longer contexts, such as full sentences within structured
documents. While NTP encourages local fluency, it provides no explicit
incentive to ensure global coherence across sentence boundaries-an essential
skill for reconstructive or discursive tasks. To investigate this, we evaluate
three commercial LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) on
Masked Sentence Prediction (MSP) - the task of infilling a randomly removed
sentence - from three domains: ROCStories (narrative), Recipe1M (procedural),
and Wikipedia (expository). We assess both fidelity (similarity to the original
sentence) and cohesiveness (fit within the surrounding context). Our key
finding reveals that commercial LLMs, despite their superlative performance in
other tasks, are poor at predicting masked sentences in low-structured domains,
highlighting a gap in current model capabilities.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在任务中表现优异，但其输出可能与输入不一致（忠实性幻觉），研究试图揭示社会偏见是否是其成因。

Method: 使用结构因果模型（SCM）验证因果关系，设计偏见干预数据集（BID）控制混杂因素，并在主流LLMs上进行实验。

Result: 实验表明偏见是忠实性幻觉的重要成因，且不同偏见状态的影响方向各异。

Conclusion: 社会偏见对幻觉生成具有显著但微妙的因果影响，尤其在不公平幻觉中表现明显。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various
tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to faithfulness hallucinations, where the
output does not align with the input. In this study, we investigate whether
social bias contributes to these hallucinations, a causal relationship that has
not been explored. A key challenge is controlling confounders within the
context, which complicates the isolation of causality between bias states and
hallucinations. To address this, we utilize the Structural Causal Model (SCM)
to establish and validate the causality and design bias interventions to
control confounders. In addition, we develop the Bias Intervention Dataset
(BID), which includes various social biases, enabling precise measurement of
causal effects. Experiments on mainstream LLMs reveal that biases are
significant causes of faithfulness hallucinations, and the effect of each bias
state differs in direction. We further analyze the scope of these causal
effects across various models, specifically focusing on unfairness
hallucinations, which are primarily targeted by social bias, revealing the
subtle yet significant causal effect of bias on hallucination generation.

Abstract: This work proposes a grammar-based chunking strategy that segments input
streams into semantically complete units by parsing dependency relations (e.g.,
noun phrase boundaries, verb-object structures) and punctuation features. The
method ensures chunk coherence and minimizes semantic fragmentation. Building
on this mechanism, we present SASST (Syntax-Aware Simultaneous Speech
Translation), an end-to-end framework integrating frozen Whisper encoder and
decoder-only LLM. The unified architecture dynamically outputs translation
tokens or <WAIT> symbols to jointly optimize translation timing and content,
with target-side reordering addressing word-order divergence. Experiments on
CoVoST2 multilingual corpus En-{De, Zh, Ja} demonstrate significant translation
quality improvements across languages and validate the effectiveness of

Motivation: 传统MoE架构使用同质化专家，固定激活参数数量，限制了计算效率。

Method: 提出Grove MoE架构，采用异质化专家和动态激活机制，基于Qwen3-30B-A3B-Base模型开发了GroveMoE-Base和GroveMoE-Inst。

Result: GroveMoE模型动态激活3.14-3.28B参数，性能与类似或更大规模的SOTA开源模型相当。

Conclusion: Grove MoE通过异质化专家和动态激活机制，实现了高效且高性能的LLM架构。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture is a cornerstone of modern
state-of-the-art (SOTA) large language models (LLMs). MoE models facilitate
scalability by enabling sparse parameter activation. However, traditional MoE
architecture uses homogeneous experts of a uniform size, activating a fixed
number of parameters irrespective of input complexity and thus limiting
computational efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Grove MoE,
a novel architecture incorporating experts of varying sizes, inspired by the
heterogeneous big.LITTLE CPU architecture. This architecture features novel
adjugate experts with a dynamic activation mechanism, enabling model capacity
expansion while maintaining manageable computational overhead. Building on this
architecture, we present GroveMoE-Base and GroveMoE-Inst, 33B-parameter LLMs
developed by applying an upcycling strategy to the Qwen3-30B-A3B-Base model
during mid-training and post-training. GroveMoE models dynamically activate
3.14-3.28B parameters based on token complexity and achieve performance
comparable to SOTA open-source models of similar or even larger size.

Method: 基于亚里士多德的修辞学原理，设计七种说服技巧，并将其嵌入数学任务的回答中，测试LLM评委的评分偏差。

Result: 说服性语言导致LLM评委对错误答案评分虚高8%，且组合使用技巧会放大偏差，模型规模和对抗提示策略均无法有效缓解。

Conclusion: LLM评委易受说服性语言影响，需开发更鲁棒的防御机制以应对此类攻击。

Abstract: As large language models take on growing roles as automated evaluators in
practical settings, a critical question arises: Can individuals persuade an LLM
judge to assign unfairly high scores? This study is the first to reveal that
strategically embedded persuasive language can bias LLM judges when scoring
mathematical reasoning tasks, where correctness should be independent of
stylistic variation. Grounded in Aristotle's rhetorical principles, we
formalize seven persuasion techniques (Majority, Consistency, Flattery,
Reciprocity, Pity, Authority, Identity) and embed them into otherwise identical
responses. Across six math benchmarks, we find that persuasive language leads
LLM judges to assign inflated scores to incorrect solutions, by up to 8% on
average, with Consistency causing the most severe distortion. Notably,
increasing model size does not substantially mitigate this vulnerability.
Further analysis demonstrates that combining multiple persuasion techniques
amplifies the bias, and pairwise evaluation is likewise susceptible. Moreover,
the persuasive effect persists under counter prompting strategies, highlighting
a critical vulnerability in LLM-as-a-Judge pipelines and underscoring the need
for robust defenses against persuasion-based attacks.

Motivation: 填补语言学中焦点分析（FA）缺乏定量评估的研究空白，并论证情感分析（SA）的组合规则适用于FA，因为两者密切相关。

Method: 利用通用依存关系（UDs）中的基本句法规则（如修饰、协调和否定规则）构建组合分析方法，并与非组合方法VADER进行对比。

Result: 组合方法在SA中表现出更高的可解释性和准确性，且适用于FA。

Conclusion: 组合方法不仅适用于SA，还可推广到FA，为相关领域提供了新的研究视角。

Abstract: This paper summarizes the results of evaluating a compositional approach for
Focus Analysis (FA) in Linguistics and Sentiment Analysis (SA) in Natural
Language Processing (NLP). While quantitative evaluations of compositional and
non-compositional approaches in SA exist in NLP, similar quantitative
evaluations are very rare in FA in Linguistics that deal with linguistic
expressions representing focus or emphasis such as "it was John who left". We
fill this gap in research by arguing that compositional rules in SA also apply
to FA because FA and SA are closely related meaning that SA is part of FA. Our
compositional approach in SA exploits basic syntactic rules such as rules of
modification, coordination, and negation represented in the formalism of
Universal Dependencies (UDs) in English and applied to words representing
sentiments from sentiment dictionaries. Some of the advantages of our
compositional analysis method for SA in contrast to non-compositional analysis
methods are interpretability and explainability. We test the accuracy of our
compositional approach and compare it with a non-compositional approach VADER
that uses simple heuristic rules to deal with negation, coordination and
modification. In contrast to previous related work that evaluates
compositionality in SA on long reviews, this study uses more appropriate
datasets to evaluate compositionality. In addition, we generalize the results
of compositional approaches in SA to compositional approaches in FA.

Abstract: Textual data annotation, the process of labeling or tagging text with
relevant information, is typically costly, time-consuming, and labor-intensive.
While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential as direct
alternatives to human annotators for general domains natural language
processing (NLP) tasks, their effectiveness on annotation tasks in domains
requiring expert knowledge remains underexplored. In this paper, we
investigate: whether top-performing LLMs, which might be perceived as having
expert-level proficiency in academic and professional benchmarks, can serve as
direct alternatives to human expert annotators? To this end, we evaluate both
individual LLMs and multi-agent approaches across three highly specialized
domains: finance, biomedicine, and law. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent
discussion framework to simulate a group of human annotators, where LLMs are
tasked to engage in discussions by considering others' annotations and
justifications before finalizing their labels. Additionally, we incorporate
reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) to enable a more comprehensive comparison. Our
empirical results reveal that: (1) Individual LLMs equipped with inference-time
techniques (e.g., chain-of-thought (CoT), self-consistency) show only marginal
or even negative performance gains, contrary to prior literature suggesting
their broad effectiveness. (2) Overall, reasoning models do not demonstrate
statistically significant improvements over non-reasoning models in most
settings. This suggests that extended long CoT provides relatively limited

TL;DR: 本文评估了10种法律专用LLM和7种通用LLM在合同理解任务上的表现，发现法律专用模型表现更优，尤其是需要法律细节的任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补法律NLP领域中对合同分类任务全面评估的空白。

Method: 评估10种法律专用LLM和7种通用LLM在三个英语合同理解任务上的表现。

Result: 法律专用LLM（如Legal-BERT和Contracts-BERT）表现优于通用模型，参数更少但效果更好。

Conclusion: 法律专用LLM在合同理解任务中表现优异，为未来系统开发提供了参考。

Abstract: Despite advances in legal NLP, no comprehensive evaluation covering multiple
legal-specific LLMs currently exists for contract classification tasks in
contract understanding. To address this gap, we present an evaluation of 10
legal-specific LLMs on three English language contract understanding tasks and
compare them with 7 general-purpose LLMs. The results show that legal-specific
LLMs consistently outperform general-purpose models, especially on tasks
requiring nuanced legal understanding. Legal-BERT and Contracts-BERT establish
new SOTAs on two of the three tasks, despite having 69% fewer parameters than
the best-performing general-purpose LLM. We also identify CaseLaw-BERT and
LexLM as strong additional baselines for contract understanding. Our results
provide a holistic evaluation of legal-specific LLMs and will facilitate the
development of more accurate contract understanding systems.

TL;DR: 本文评估了19种不同规模和架构的大语言模型（LLM）在捷克语ABSA任务中的表现，发现领域特定的小模型在微调后优于通用LLM，而微调的LLM达到了最先进水平。


<details>

Motivation: 捷克语ABSA任务中LLM的能力尚未充分探索，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 对19种LLM在零样本、少样本和微调场景下进行综合评估，分析多语言性、模型规模和时效性等因素的影响。

Result: 领域特定小模型在微调后表现最佳，微调LLM达到SOTA；多语言性和模型规模对性能有显著影响。

Conclusion: LLM在捷克语ABSA中具有潜力，但需结合领域特定优化；研究为未来工作提供了指导。

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained sentiment analysis
task that aims to identify sentiment toward specific aspects of an entity.
While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in various
natural language processing (NLP) tasks, their capabilities for Czech ABSA
remain largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation
of 19 LLMs of varying sizes and architectures on Czech ABSA, comparing their
performance in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning scenarios. Our results show
that small domain-specific models fine-tuned for ABSA outperform
general-purpose LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot settings, while fine-tuned LLMs
achieve state-of-the-art results. We analyze how factors such as
multilingualism, model size, and recency influence performance and present an
error analysis highlighting key challenges, particularly in aspect term
prediction. Our findings provide insights into the suitability of LLMs for
Czech ABSA and offer guidance for future research in this area.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在低资源语言中，通过添加少量目标语言示例到训练集，显著提升跨语言方面级情感分析（ABSA）性能的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管ABSA在英语中已得到广泛研究，但低资源语言由于标注数据稀缺仍面临挑战。现有跨语言方法常依赖外部翻译工具，而忽视了加入少量目标语言示例的潜在优势。

Method: 评估在四种ABSA任务、六种目标语言和两种序列到序列模型中，添加少量目标语言示例对性能的影响。

Result: 仅添加十个目标语言示例即可显著优于零样本设置，效果接近约束解码；结合1000个目标语言示例和英语数据甚至能超越单语基线。

Conclusion: 这些发现为低资源和特定领域中的跨语言ABSA提供了实用改进方案，表明获取少量高质量标注示例既可行又高效。

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has received substantial attention in
English, yet challenges remain for low-resource languages due to the scarcity
of labelled data. Current cross-lingual ABSA approaches often rely on external
translation tools and overlook the potential benefits of incorporating a small
number of target language examples into training. In this paper, we evaluate
the effect of adding few-shot target language examples to the training set
across four ABSA tasks, six target languages, and two sequence-to-sequence
models. We show that adding as few as ten target language examples
significantly improves performance over zero-shot settings and achieves a
similar effect to constrained decoding in reducing prediction errors.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that combining 1,000 target language examples with
English data can even surpass monolingual baselines. These findings offer
practical insights for improving cross-lingual ABSA in low-resource and
domain-specific settings, as obtaining ten high-quality annotated examples is
both feasible and highly effective.

Motivation: LLMs在情感支持方面表现出潜力，但其文化敏感性未被充分研究，缺乏相关资源。

Method: 引入CultureCare数据集，开发四种适应策略，评估三种LLMs的表现，并通过多角度评估验证效果。

Result: 适应后的LLMs表现优于匿名在线同伴回应，简单的文化角色扮演不足以实现文化敏感性。

Conclusion: LLMs在临床培训中具有潜力，可帮助培养未来治疗师的文化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in offering emotional support and
generating empathetic responses for individuals in distress, but their ability
to deliver culturally sensitive support remains underexplored due to lack of
resources. In this work, we introduce CultureCare, the first dataset designed
for this task, spanning four cultures and including 1729 distress messages,
1523 cultural signals, and 1041 support strategies with fine-grained emotional
and cultural annotations. Leveraging CultureCare, we (i) develop and test four
adaptation strategies for guiding three state-of-the-art LLMs toward culturally
sensitive responses; (ii) conduct comprehensive evaluations using LLM judges,
in-culture human annotators, and clinical psychologists; (iii) show that
adapted LLMs outperform anonymous online peer responses, and that simple
cultural role-play is insufficient for cultural sensitivity; and (iv) explore
the application of LLMs in clinical training, where experts highlight their
potential in fostering cultural competence in future therapists.

Motivation: 手语虚拟角色在情感非手动信号方面缺乏标准化方法，导致情感表达困难。

Result: 该方法能更一致地指定情感非手动信号，并支持更细腻的情感状态表达。

Conclusion: 双参数表示法为手语虚拟角色的情感表达提供了一种更连贯和标准化的解决方案。

Abstract: Non-manual signals in sign languages continue to be a challenge for signing
avatars. More specifically, emotional content has been difficult to incorporate
because of a lack of a standard method of specifying the avatar's emotional
state. This paper explores the application of an intuitive two-parameter
representation for emotive non-manual signals to the Paula signing avatar that
shows promise for facilitating the linguistic specification of emotional facial
expressions in a more coherent manner than previous methods. Users can apply
these parameters to control Paula's emotional expressions through a textual
representation called the EASIER notation. The representation can allow avatars
to express more nuanced emotional states using two numerical parameters. It
also has the potential to enable more consistent specification of emotional
non-manual signals in linguistic annotations which drive signing avatars.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有自动评估方法和LLM评委无法准确捕捉专家偏好和领域质量标准的问题，支持人机协作写作。

Method: 提出GREP多轮评估框架，分解评估维度，结合对比少样本示例，设计两种变体（专有LLM和开源LLM）。

Result: GREP比标准LLM评委更稳健，与专家评估强相关，但当前LLM生成内容难以满足要求且改进有限。

Conclusion: GREP为科学写作质量评估提供有效工具，但LLM生成内容仍需进一步优化。

Abstract: Expert domain writing, such as scientific writing, typically demands
extensive domain knowledge. Recent advances in LLMs show promising potential in
reducing the expert workload. However, evaluating the quality of automatically
generated scientific writing is a crucial open issue, as it requires knowledge
of domain-specific evaluation criteria and the ability to discern expert
preferences. Conventional automatic metrics and LLM-as-a-judge systems are
insufficient to grasp expert preferences and domain-specific quality standards.
To address this gap and support human-AI collaborative writing, we focus on
related work generation, one of the most challenging scientific tasks, as an
exemplar. We propose GREP, a multi-turn evaluation framework that integrates
classical related work evaluation criteria with expert-specific preferences.
Instead of assigning a single score, our framework decomposes the evaluation
into fine-grained dimensions. This localized evaluation approach is further
augmented with contrastive few-shot examples to provide detailed contextual
guidance for the evaluation dimensions. The design principles allow our
framework to deliver cardinal assessment of quality, which can facilitate
better post-training compared to ordinal preference data. For better
accessibility, we design two variants of GREP: a more precise variant with
proprietary LLMs as evaluators, and a cheaper alternative with open-weight
LLMs. Empirical investigation reveals that our framework is able to assess the
quality of related work sections in a much more robust manner compared to
standard LLM judges, reflects natural scenarios of scientific writing, and
bears a strong correlation with the human expert assessment. We also observe
that generations from state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to satisfy validation
constraints of a suitable related work section. They (mostly) fail to improve
based on feedback as well.

Conclusion: 本文为情感计算、比喻语言处理与LLMs交叉领域的研究者提供了宝贵资源，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Subjective language understanding refers to a broad set of natural language
processing tasks where the goal is to interpret or generate content that
conveys personal feelings, opinions, or figurative meanings rather than
objective facts. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) such as
ChatGPT, LLaMA, and others, there has been a paradigm shift in how we approach
these inherently nuanced tasks. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive
review of recent advances in applying LLMs to subjective language tasks,
including sentiment analysis, emotion recognition, sarcasm detection, humor
understanding, stance detection, metaphor interpretation, intent detection, and
aesthetics assessment. We begin by clarifying the definition of subjective
language from linguistic and cognitive perspectives, and we outline the unique
challenges posed by subjective language (e.g. ambiguity, figurativeness,
context dependence). We then survey the evolution of LLM architectures and
techniques that particularly benefit subjectivity tasks, highlighting why LLMs
are well-suited to model subtle human-like judgments. For each of the eight
tasks, we summarize task definitions, key datasets, state-of-the-art LLM-based
methods, and remaining challenges. We provide comparative insights, discussing
commonalities and differences among tasks and how multi-task LLM approaches
might yield unified models of subjectivity. Finally, we identify open issues
such as data limitations, model bias, and ethical considerations, and suggest
future research directions. We hope this survey will serve as a valuable
resource for researchers and practitioners interested in the intersection of
affective computing, figurative language processing, and large-scale language
models.

Abstract: Current speech translation systems, while having achieved impressive
accuracies, are rather static in their behavior and do not adapt to real-world
situations in ways human interpreters do. In order to improve their practical
usefulness and enable interpreting-like experiences, a precise understanding of
the nature of human interpreting is crucial. To this end, we discuss human
interpreting literature from the perspective of the machine translation field,
while considering both operational and qualitative aspects. We identify
implications for the development of speech translation systems and argue that
there is great potential to adopt many human interpreting principles using
recent modeling techniques. We hope that our findings provide inspiration for
closing the perceived usability gap, and can motivate progress toward true
machine interpreting.

Motivation: 现有SiLM模型的评估规模较小且缺乏系统性，本文旨在填补这一空白并比较不同模型的性能。

Method: 比较了Structformer、UDGN和GPST三种SiLM架构，评估了它们在句法表示、语法判断任务和训练动态上的表现。

Result: GPST在多项评估中表现最稳定，尤其在长距离依赖任务上优于其他模型。小型模型在合成数据上的训练为评估提供了有效测试平台。

Conclusion: 不同SiLM架构各有优劣，GPST表现最稳定，合成数据训练的小模型有助于基础模型评估。

Abstract: Structure-inducing Language Models (SiLM) are trained on a self-supervised
language modeling task, and induce a hierarchical sentence representation as a
byproduct when processing an input. A wide variety of SiLMs have been proposed.
However, these have typically been evaluated on a relatively small scale, and
evaluation of these models has systematic gaps and lacks comparability. In this
work, we study three different SiLM architectures using both natural language
(English) corpora and synthetic bracketing expressions: Structformer (Shen et
al., 2021), UDGN (Shen et al., 2022) and GPST (Hu et al., 2024). We compare
them with respect to (i) properties of the induced syntactic representations
(ii) performance on grammaticality judgment tasks, and (iii) training dynamics.
We find that none of the three architectures dominates across all evaluation
metrics. However, there are significant differences, in particular with respect
to the induced syntactic representations. The Generative Pretrained Structured
Transformer (GPST; Hu et al. 2024) performs most consistently across evaluation
settings, and outperforms the other models on long-distance dependencies in
bracketing expressions. Furthermore, our study shows that small models trained
on large amounts of synthetic data provide a useful testbed for evaluating
basic model properties.

Motivation: 现有开源代理在搜索智能（如处理模糊查询、生成精确搜索和分析结果）方面表现不足，且现有RL方法因轮次限制无法学习复杂策略。

Method: 提出ASearcher，采用可扩展的完全异步RL训练和基于提示的LLM代理，自主生成高质量QA数据集。

Conclusion: ASearcher在简单设计下显著超越现有开源32B代理，并开源了模型、训练数据和代码。

Abstract: Recent advancements in LLM-based agents have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in handling complex, knowledge-intensive tasks by integrating
external tools. Among diverse choices of tools, search tools play a pivotal
role in accessing vast external knowledge. However, open-source agents still
fall short of achieving expert-level Search Intelligence, the ability to
resolve ambiguous queries, generate precise searches, analyze results, and
conduct thorough exploration. Existing approaches fall short in scalability,
efficiency, and data quality. For example, small turn limits in existing online
RL methods, e.g. <=10, restrict complex strategy learning. This paper
introduces ASearcher, an open-source project for large-scale RL training of
search agents. Our key contributions include: (1) Scalable fully asynchronous
RL training that enables long-horizon search while maintaining high training
efficiency. (2) A prompt-based LLM agent that autonomously synthesizes
high-quality and challenging QAs, creating a large-scale QA dataset. Through RL
training, our prompt-based QwQ-32B agent achieves substantial improvements,
with 46.7% and 20.8% Avg@4 gains on xBench and GAIA, respectively. Notably, our
agent exhibits extreme long-horizon search, with tool calls exceeding 40 turns
and output tokens exceeding 150k during training time. With a simple agent
design and no external LLMs, ASearcher-Web-QwQ achieves Avg@4 scores of 42.1 on
xBench and 52.8 on GAIA, surpassing existing open-source 32B agents. We
open-source our models, training data, and codes in

Result: 评估显示当前语言模型在科学隐喻检测中表现一般，领域特定隐喻理解仍有提升空间。

Conclusion: MCC为科学隐喻研究提供了首个标注资源，支持多种应用，如隐喻检测基准测试和患者沟通工具。

Abstract: Metaphor is a fundamental cognitive mechanism that shapes scientific
understanding, enabling the communication of complex concepts while potentially
constraining paradigmatic thinking. Despite the prevalence of figurative
language in scientific discourse, existing metaphor detection resources
primarily focus on general-domain text, leaving a critical gap for
domain-specific applications. In this paper, we present the Medical Metaphors
Corpus (MCC), a comprehensive dataset of 792 annotated scientific conceptual
metaphors spanning medical and biological domains. MCC aggregates metaphorical
expressions from diverse sources including peer-reviewed literature, news
media, social media discourse, and crowdsourced contributions, providing both
binary and graded metaphoricity judgments validated through human annotation.
Each instance includes source-target conceptual mappings and perceived
metaphoricity scores on a 0-7 scale, establishing the first annotated resource
for computational scientific metaphor research. Our evaluation demonstrates
that state-of-the-art language models achieve modest performance on scientific
metaphor detection, revealing substantial room for improvement in
domain-specific figurative language understanding. MCC enables multiple
research applications including metaphor detection benchmarking, quality-aware
generation systems, and patient-centered communication tools.

Conclusion: 当前搜索代理在大规模信息收集中存在重大缺陷，需进一步研究改进；WideSearch基准为未来研究提供了工具。

Abstract: From professional research to everyday planning, many tasks are bottlenecked
by wide-scale information seeking, which is more repetitive than cognitively
complex. With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), automated
search agents powered by LLMs offer a promising solution to liberate humans
from this tedious work. However, the capability of these agents to perform such
"wide-context" collection reliably and completely remains largely unevaluated
due to a lack of suitable benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce
WideSearch, a new benchmark engineered to evaluate agent reliability on these
large-scale collection tasks. The benchmark features 200 manually curated
questions (100 in English, 100 in Chinese) from over 15 diverse domains,
grounded in real user queries. Each task requires agents to collect large-scale
atomic information, which could be verified one by one objectively, and arrange
it into a well-organized output. A rigorous five-stage quality control pipeline
ensures the difficulty, completeness, and verifiability of the dataset. We
benchmark over 10 state-of-the-art agentic search systems, including
single-agent, multi-agent frameworks, and end-to-end commercial systems. Most
systems achieve overall success rates near 0\%, with the best performer
reaching just 5\%. However, given sufficient time, cross-validation by multiple
human testers can achieve a near 100\% success rate. These results demonstrate
that present search agents have critical deficiencies in large-scale
information seeking, underscoring urgent areas for future research and
development in agentic search. Our dataset, evaluation pipeline, and benchmark
results have been publicly released at https://widesearch-seed.github.io/

Motivation: 现有方法在扩展大语言模型深度时忽略神经元排列差异，导致性能下降。

Method: 通过最优传输对齐和融合相邻层的Transformer块，创建新层。

Result: OpT-DeUS在持续预训练和监督微调中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 新层插入靠近顶部时，训练效率更高且性能更优。

Abstract: Scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) yields performance gains but incurs
substantial training costs. Depth up-scaling offers training efficiency by
adding new layers to pre-trained models. However, most existing methods copy or
average weights from base layers, neglecting neuron permutation differences.
This limitation can potentially cause misalignment that harms performance.
Inspired by applying Optimal Transport (OT) for neuron alignment, we propose
Optimal Transport Depth Up-Scaling (OpT-DeUS). OpT-DeUS aligns and fuses
Transformer blocks in adjacent base layers via OT for new layer creation, to
mitigate neuron permutation mismatch between layers. OpT-DeUS achieves better
overall performance and offers improved training efficiency than existing
methods for continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning across different
model sizes. To further evaluate the impact of interpolation positions, our
extensive analysis shows that inserting new layers closer to the top results in
higher training efficiency due to shorter back-propagation time while obtaining
additional performance gains.

Conclusion: 该方法在参数和数据效率上表现良好，为SLM的改进提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Conversational systems relying on text-based large language models (LLMs)
often overlook paralinguistic cues, essential for understanding emotions and
intentions. Speech-language models (SLMs), which use speech as input, are
emerging as a promising solution. However, SLMs built by extending frozen LLMs
struggle to capture paralinguistic information and exhibit reduced context
understanding. We identify entangled information and improper training
strategies as key issues. To address these issues, we propose two heterogeneous
adapters and suggest a weakly supervised training strategy. Our approach
disentangles paralinguistic and linguistic information, enabling SLMs to
interpret speech through structured representations. It also preserves
contextual understanding by avoiding the generation of task-specific vectors
through controlled randomness. This approach trains only the adapters on common
datasets, ensuring parameter and data efficiency. Experiments demonstrate
competitive performance in emotional conversation tasks, showcasing the model's
ability to effectively integrate both paralinguistic and linguistic information
within contextual settings.

Result: 多数检测器难以准确识别中间贡献级别文本（如LLM改进的人类文本），且易产生误报。

Conclusion: 现有检测器在教育场景中效果有限，需改进以减少误报，避免对学生造成负面影响。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their increased
accessibility have made it easier than ever for students to automatically
generate texts, posing new challenges for educational institutions. To enforce
norms of academic integrity and ensure students' learning, learning analytics
methods to automatically detect LLM-generated text appear increasingly
appealing. This paper benchmarks the performance of different state-of-the-art
detectors in educational contexts, introducing a novel dataset, called
Generative Essay Detection in Education (GEDE), containing over 900
student-written essays and over 12,500 LLM-generated essays from various
domains. To capture the diversity of LLM usage practices in generating text, we
propose the concept of contribution levels, representing students' contribution
to a given assignment. These levels range from purely human-written texts, to
slightly LLM-improved versions, to fully LLM-generated texts, and finally to
active attacks on the detector by "humanizing" generated texts. We show that
most detectors struggle to accurately classify texts of intermediate student
contribution levels, like LLM-improved human-written texts. Detectors are
particularly likely to produce false positives, which is problematic in
educational settings where false suspicions can severely impact students'
lives. Our dataset, code, and additional supplementary materials are publicly
available at

TL;DR: 研究比较了HuBERT和wav2vec 2.0两种自监督语音表示学习模型，发现训练迭代次数（而非训练目标）对隐藏表示与语言信息的关联性影响更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨模型架构对自监督语音表示学习中语言信息的影响。

Method: 比较HuBERT和wav2vec 2.0的训练目标和迭代伪标签细化。

Result: 训练迭代次数显著影响隐藏表示与语言信息的关联性。

Conclusion: 建议未来研究探索迭代细化在编码语言信息中的有效性原因。

Abstract: Self-supervised models for speech representation learning now see widespread
use for their versatility and performance on downstream tasks, but the effect
of model architecture on the linguistic information learned in their
representations remains under-studied. This study investigates two such models,
HuBERT and wav2vec 2.0, and minimally compares two of their architectural
differences: training objective and iterative pseudo-label refinement through
multiple training iterations. We find that differences in canonical correlation
of hidden representations to word identity, phoneme identity, and speaker
identity are explained by training iteration, not training objective. We
suggest that future work investigate the reason for the effectiveness of
iterative refinement in encoding linguistic information in self-supervised
speech representations.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个新的捷克语数据集，用于基于方面的情感分析（ABSA），包含3.1K手动标注的餐厅评论，支持更复杂的任务如目标-方面类别检测，并提供了24M未标注评论用于无监督学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有捷克语数据集仅支持基本ABSA任务，缺乏复杂任务的支持，因此需要开发一个统一标注格式的新数据集。

Method: 基于SemEval-2016格式构建数据集，采用两名标注员进行标注，标注一致性达90%，并提供了未标注数据用于无监督学习。

Result: 数据集支持跨语言比较，并提供了基于Transformer模型的基线结果和错误分析。

Conclusion: 新数据集填补了捷克语ABSA复杂任务的空白，为研究提供了丰富资源。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel Czech dataset for aspect-based sentiment
analysis (ABSA), which consists of 3.1K manually annotated reviews from the
restaurant domain. The dataset is built upon the older Czech dataset, which
contained only separate labels for the basic ABSA tasks such as aspect term
extraction or aspect polarity detection. Unlike its predecessor, our new
dataset is specifically designed for more complex tasks, e.g.
target-aspect-category detection. These advanced tasks require a unified
annotation format, seamlessly linking sentiment elements (labels) together. Our
dataset follows the format of the well-known SemEval-2016 datasets. This design
choice allows effortless application and evaluation in cross-lingual scenarios,
ultimately fostering cross-language comparisons with equivalent counterpart
datasets in other languages. The annotation process engaged two trained
annotators, yielding an impressive inter-annotator agreement rate of
approximately 90%. Additionally, we provide 24M reviews without annotations
suitable for unsupervised learning. We present robust monolingual baseline
results achieved with various Transformer-based models and insightful error
analysis to supplement our contributions. Our code and dataset are freely
available for non-commercial research purposes.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为OTReg的方法，通过最优传输正则化解决语音与文本表示之间的模态差距，提升语音语言模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音语言模型（SLMs）在处理语音输入时存在模态差距问题，导致泛化能力不足，无法像预期那样以文本方式处理语音。

Method: 引入最优传输正则化（OTReg），将语音与文本对齐建模为最优传输问题，通过正则化损失优化SLM训练。

Result: 实验表明，OTReg能有效提升语音与文本的对齐效果，减少模态差距，并增强SLM在多语言ASR任务中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: OTReg是一种轻量级方法，无需额外标签或参数，能显著改善SLM的泛化性能。

Abstract: Spoken Language Models (SLMs), which extend Large Language Models (LLMs) to
perceive speech inputs, have gained increasing attention for their potential to
advance speech understanding tasks. However, despite recent progress, studies
show that SLMs often struggle to generalize across datasets, even for trained
languages and tasks, raising concerns about whether they process speech in a
text-like manner as intended. A key challenge underlying this limitation is the
modality gap between speech and text representations. The high variability in
speech embeddings may allow SLMs to achieve strong in-domain performance by
exploiting unintended speech variations, ultimately hindering generalization.
To mitigate this modality gap, we introduce Optimal Transport Regularization
(OTReg), a method that formulates speech-text alignment as an optimal transport
problem and derives a regularization loss to improve SLM training. In each
training iteration, OTReg first establishes a structured correspondence between
speech and transcript embeddings by determining the optimal transport plan,
then incorporates the regularization loss based on this transport plan to
optimize SLMs in generating speech embeddings that align more effectively with
transcript embeddings. OTReg is lightweight, requiring no additional labels or
learnable parameters, and integrates seamlessly into existing SLM training
procedures. Extensive multilingual ASR experiments demonstrate that OTReg
enhances speech-text alignment, mitigates the modality gap, and consequently
improves SLM generalization across diverse datasets.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）生成不可靠内容的问题，提出了一种基于标记级不确定性的可靠性估计方法，用于检测不可靠输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在多轮或代理应用中容易生成流畅但不正确的内容（即虚构内容），这增加了风险。研究旨在探讨上下文信息如何影响模型行为，以及LLMs是否能识别其不可靠响应。

Method: 提出了一种可靠性估计方法，通过计算输出logits的偶然性和认知不确定性，识别关键标记，并将其隐藏状态聚合为紧凑表示，用于预测响应级可靠性。

Result: 实验表明，正确的上下文信息提高了答案准确性和模型置信度，而误导性上下文常导致模型自信地生成错误答案。提出的方法在多开源LLMs中改善了不可靠输出的检测。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了直接不确定性信号的局限性，并强调了不确定性引导探测在可靠性感知生成中的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generating fluent but incorrect
content, known as confabulation, which poses increasing risks in multi-turn or
agentic applications where outputs may be reused as context. In this work, we
investigate how in-context information influences model behavior and whether
LLMs can identify their unreliable responses. We propose a reliability
estimation that leverages token-level uncertainty to guide the aggregation of
internal model representations. Specifically, we compute aleatoric and
epistemic uncertainty from output logits to identify salient tokens and
aggregate their hidden states into compact representations for response-level
reliability prediction. Through controlled experiments on open QA benchmarks,
we find that correct in-context information improves both answer accuracy and
model confidence, while misleading context often induces confidently incorrect
responses, revealing a misalignment between uncertainty and correctness. Our
probing-based method captures these shifts in model behavior and improves the
detection of unreliable outputs across multiple open-source LLMs. These results
underscore the limitations of direct uncertainty signals and highlight the
potential of uncertainty-guided probing for reliability-aware generation.

TL;DR: 论文提出Dual-Div框架，通过两阶段检索和排序优化生物医学NLP任务中的示例选择，强调多样性与代表性，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生物医学NLP任务中选择示例时过于注重代表性而忽视多样性，导致性能受限。

Method: Dual-Div采用两阶段方法：先通过优化代表性和多样性检索候选示例，再根据测试查询排序选择最相关且非冗余的示例。

Result: 在三个生物医学NLP任务中，Dual-Div比基线方法性能提升高达5%的macro-F1分数，且对提示变化和类别不平衡具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 多样性在初始检索阶段比排序阶段优化更重要，且限制示例数量为3-5个可最大化性能效率。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has leveraged their
in-context learning (ICL) abilities to enable quick adaptation to unseen
biomedical NLP tasks. By incorporating only a few input-output examples into
prompts, LLMs can rapidly perform these new tasks. While the impact of these
demonstrations on LLM performance has been extensively studied, most existing
approaches prioritize representativeness over diversity when selecting examples
from large corpora. To address this gap, we propose Dual-Div, a
diversity-enhanced data-efficient framework for demonstration selection in
biomedical ICL. Dual-Div employs a two-stage retrieval and ranking process:
First, it identifies a limited set of candidate examples from a corpus by
optimizing both representativeness and diversity (with optional annotation for
unlabeled data). Second, it ranks these candidates against test queries to
select the most relevant and non-redundant demonstrations. Evaluated on three
biomedical NLP tasks (named entity recognition (NER), relation extraction (RE),
and text classification (TC)) using LLaMA 3.1 and Qwen 2.5 for inference, along
with three retrievers (BGE-Large, BMRetriever, MedCPT), Dual-Div consistently
outperforms baselines-achieving up to 5% higher macro-F1 scores-while
demonstrating robustness to prompt permutations and class imbalance. Our
findings establish that diversity in initial retrieval is more critical than
ranking-stage optimization, and limiting demonstrations to 3-5 examples
maximizes performance efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在强化学习中容易陷入无效推理路径（dead ends），导致决策不准确，影响探索和政策优化。

Method: 提出REX-RAG框架，结合混合采样策略（探索新路径）和政策校正机制（修正分布偏移）。

Result: 在7个问答基准测试中，REX-RAG平均性能提升5.1%（Qwen2.5-3B）和3.6%（Qwen2.5-7B）。

Conclusion: REX-RAG有效解决了LLM在强化学习中的推理路径问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is emerging as a powerful paradigm for enabling
large language models (LLMs) to perform complex reasoning tasks. Recent
advances indicate that integrating RL with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
allows LLMs to dynamically incorporate external knowledge, leading to more
informed and robust decision making. However, we identify a critical challenge
during policy-driven trajectory sampling: LLMs are frequently trapped in
unproductive reasoning paths, which we refer to as "dead ends", committing to
overconfident yet incorrect conclusions. This severely hampers exploration and
undermines effective policy optimization. To address this challenge, we propose
REX-RAG (Reasoning Exploration with Policy Correction in Retrieval-Augmented
Generation), a novel framework that explores alternative reasoning paths while
maintaining rigorous policy learning through principled distributional
corrections. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) Mixed Sampling
Strategy, which combines a novel probe sampling method with exploratory prompts
to escape dead ends; and (2) Policy Correction Mechanism, which employs
importance sampling to correct distribution shifts induced by mixed sampling,
thereby mitigating gradient estimation bias. We evaluate it on seven
question-answering benchmarks, and the experimental results show that REX-RAG
achieves average performance gains of 5.1% on Qwen2.5-3B and 3.6% on Qwen2.5-7B
over strong baselines, demonstrating competitive results across multiple
datasets. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/MiliLab/REX-RAG.

capture disagreement patterns better. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate substantial improvements in both soft and perspectivist evaluation
metrics across three datasets. We also conduct in-depth error and calibration
analyses, highlighting the conditions under which improvements occur. Our
findings underscore the value of disagreement-aware modeling and offer insights
into how system components interact with the complexity of human-annotated

Motivation: 推测解码是加速大型语言模型推理速度的标准方法，但在生产环境中扩展时面临工程挑战，如高效实现GPU上的不同操作。

Method: 详细介绍了训练和推理优化技术，包括树注意力和多轮推测解码等操作的实现。

Result: 在8个NVIDIA H100 GPU上，Llama4 Maverick的推理延迟达到每token约4毫秒（批大小为1），比之前最佳方法快10%。对于EAGLE-based推测解码，优化后在大批量下实现了1.4x至2.0x的加速。

Conclusion: 通过优化技术，成功在生产规模下实现了EAGLE-based推测解码的高效推理，为Llama模型设定了新的性能标杆。

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a standard method for accelerating the inference
speed of large language models. However, scaling it for production environments
poses several engineering challenges, including efficiently implementing
different operations (e.g., tree attention and multi-round speculative
decoding) on GPU. In this paper, we detail the training and inference
optimization techniques that we have implemented to enable EAGLE-based
speculative decoding at a production scale for Llama models. With these
changes, we achieve a new state-of-the-art inference latency for Llama models.
For example, Llama4 Maverick decodes at a speed of about 4 ms per token (with a
batch size of one) on 8 NVIDIA H100 GPUs, which is 10% faster than the
previously best known method. Furthermore, for EAGLE-based speculative
decoding, our optimizations enable us to achieve a speed-up for large batch
sizes between 1.4x and 2.0x at production scale.

Motivation: 当前研究多关注模型校准，但较少探讨模型不确定性是否与人类不确定性一致，这对提升LLM用户体验至关重要。

Method: 评估了一系列推理时不确定性度量方法，包括传统指标和新变体，以分析其与人类群体不确定性和模型校准的关联。

Conclusion: 模型不确定性可以与人类不确定性对齐，且某些度量方法在模型校准方面表现良好。

Abstract: There has been much recent interest in evaluating large language models for
uncertainty calibration to facilitate model control and modulate user trust.
Inference time uncertainty, which may provide a real-time signal to the model
or external control modules, is particularly important for applying these
concepts to improve LLM-user experience in practice. While many of the existing
papers consider model calibration, comparatively little work has sought to
evaluate how closely model uncertainty aligns to human uncertainty. In this
work, we evaluate a collection of inference-time uncertainty measures, using
both established metrics and novel variations, to determine how closely they
align with both human group-level uncertainty and traditional notions of model
calibration. We find that numerous measures show evidence of strong alignment
to human uncertainty, even despite the lack of alignment to human answer
preference. For those successful metrics, we find moderate to strong evidence
of model calibration in terms of both correctness correlation and
distributional analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水印方法损害文本质量且需白盒模型访问，限制了API模型和多语言场景的应用。

Method: 基于生成文本的特征统计，通过拒绝采样选择符合密钥目标的输出，无需修改模型逻辑或训练。

Result: 在4个数据集上表现优异，英语F1达99.7%，多比特检测准确率高。

Conclusion: SAEMark为闭源LLM提供了一种可扩展的水印范式，支持内容溯源且保持文本质量。

Abstract: Watermarking LLM-generated text is critical for content attribution and
misinformation prevention. However, existing methods compromise text quality,
require white-box model access and logit manipulation. These limitations
exclude API-based models and multilingual scenarios. We propose SAEMark, a
general framework for post-hoc multi-bit watermarking that embeds personalized
messages solely via inference-time, feature-based rejection sampling without
altering model logits or requiring training. Our approach operates on
deterministic features extracted from generated text, selecting outputs whose
feature statistics align with key-derived targets. This framework naturally
generalizes across languages and domains while preserving text quality through
sampling LLM outputs instead of modifying. We provide theoretical guarantees
relating watermark success probability and compute budget that hold for any
suitable feature extractor. Empirically, we demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), achieving superior detection
accuracy and text quality. Experiments across 4 datasets show SAEMark's
consistent performance, with 99.7% F1 on English and strong multi-bit detection
accuracy. SAEMark establishes a new paradigm for scalable watermarking that
works out-of-the-box with closed-source LLMs while enabling content
attribution.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（如GPT-5）在医学领域中的多模态推理能力，以支持复杂的临床决策。

Method: 通过标准化测试集（如MedQA、MedXpertQA等）评估GPT-5及其变体在文本和多模态问答任务中的表现。

Result: GPT-5在所有基准测试中均达到最优性能，多模态推理能力显著提升，超越人类专家表现。

Conclusion: GPT-5在医学决策支持中展现出超越人类专家的潜力，为未来临床系统设计提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled general-purpose
systems to perform increasingly complex domain-specific reasoning without
extensive fine-tuning. In the medical domain, decision-making often requires
integrating heterogeneous information sources, including patient narratives,
structured data, and medical images. This study positions GPT-5 as a generalist
multimodal reasoner for medical decision support and systematically evaluates
its zero-shot chain-of-thought reasoning performance on both text-based
question answering and visual question answering tasks under a unified
protocol. We benchmark GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano, and GPT-4o-2024-11-20
against standardized splits of MedQA, MedXpertQA (text and multimodal), MMLU
medical subsets, USMLE self-assessment exams, and VQA-RAD. Results show that
GPT-5 consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving state-of-the-art
accuracy across all QA benchmarks and delivering substantial gains in
multimodal reasoning. On MedXpertQA MM, GPT-5 improves reasoning and
understanding scores by +29.62% and +36.18% over GPT-4o, respectively, and
surpasses pre-licensed human experts by +24.23% in reasoning and +29.40% in
understanding. In contrast, GPT-4o remains below human expert performance in
most dimensions. A representative case study demonstrates GPT-5's ability to
integrate visual and textual cues into a coherent diagnostic reasoning chain,
recommending appropriate high-stakes interventions. Our results show that, on
these controlled multimodal reasoning benchmarks, GPT-5 moves from
human-comparable to above human-expert performance. This improvement may
substantially inform the design of future clinical decision-support systems.

Method: 提出PsyCrisis-Bench基准，采用基于专家定义原则的提示式LLM-as-Judge方法，进行多维度二进制评分。

Result: 实验显示，该方法与专家评估一致性最高，且评估理由更易解释。

Conclusion: PsyCrisis-Bench为心理健康对话的安全性评估提供了有效工具，并公开数据集以促进研究。

Abstract: Evaluating the safety alignment of LLM responses in high-risk mental health
dialogues is particularly difficult due to missing gold-standard answers and
the ethically sensitive nature of these interactions. To address this
challenge, we propose PsyCrisis-Bench, a reference-free evaluation benchmark
based on real-world Chinese mental health dialogues. It evaluates whether the
model responses align with the safety principles defined by experts.
Specifically designed for settings without standard references, our method
adopts a prompt-based LLM-as-Judge approach that conducts in-context evaluation
using expert-defined reasoning chains grounded in psychological intervention
principles. We employ binary point-wise scoring across multiple safety
dimensions to enhance the explainability and traceability of the evaluation.
Additionally, we present a manually curated, high-quality Chinese-language
dataset covering self-harm, suicidal ideation, and existential distress,
derived from real-world online discourse. Experiments on 3600 judgments show
that our method achieves the highest agreement with expert assessments and
produces more interpretable evaluation rationales compared to existing
approaches. Our dataset and evaluation tool are publicly available to
facilitate further research.

Abstract: Unlimited, or so-called helpful-only language models are trained without
safety alignment constraints and never refuse user queries. They are widely
used by leading AI companies as internal tools for red teaming and alignment
evaluation. For example, if a safety-aligned model produces harmful outputs
similar to an unlimited model, this indicates alignment failures that require
further attention. Despite their essential role in assessing alignment, such
models are not available to the research community.
  We introduce Jinx, a helpful-only variant of popular open-weight LLMs. Jinx
responds to all queries without refusals or safety filtering, while preserving
the base model's capabilities in reasoning and instruction following. It
provides researchers with an accessible tool for probing alignment failures,
evaluating safety boundaries, and systematically studying failure modes in
language model safety.

Abstract: Serialized television narratives present significant analytical challenges
due to their complex, temporally distributed storylines that necessitate
sophisticated information management. This paper introduces a multi-agent
system (MAS) designed to extract and analyze narrative arcs by implementing
principles of computational memory architectures. The system conceptualizes
narrative understanding through analogues of human memory: Large Language
Models (LLMs) provide a form of semantic memory for general narrative patterns,
while a vector database stores specific arc progressions as episodic memories.
A multi-agent workflow simulates working memory processes to integrate these
information types. Tested on the first season of Grey's Anatomy (ABC 2005-),
the MAS identifies three arc types: Anthology (self-contained), Soap
(relationship-focused), and Genre-Specific. These arcs and their episodic
developments are stored in a vector database, facilitating structured analysis
and semantic comparison. To bridge automation with critical interpretation, a
graphical interface enables human oversight and refinement of the system's
narrative memory. While demonstrating strong performance in identifying
Anthology Arcs and character entities, the system's reliance on textual
paratexts (episode summaries) revealed limitations in discerning overlapping
arcs and opaque dynamics, underscoring the challenges in computational memory
consolidation versus human holistic understanding. This memory-centric approach

mechanisms within the MAS, and expanding testing across diverse genres.

*Ramadhan J. Mstafa*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于DWT和QR码的可逆视频隐写方法，结合改进的ElGamal加密系统，提高了安全性和隐蔽性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着互联网技术的发展，隐私和数据安全问题日益突出，数字隐写术在保护隐私信息中至关重要。视频因其高容量成为研究热点，但现有方法在视觉不可感知性、鲁棒性和嵌入容量方面存在挑战。

Method: 使用改进的ElGamal算法加密QR码，对视频帧的Y分量进行二维DWT分解，将加密后的QR码嵌入HL、HH子带及U、V分量中。

Result: 方法具有高安全性、隐蔽性和抗噪声攻击能力（SSIM>0.91），PSNR平均52.143 dB，嵌入容量1 bpp。

Conclusion: 该方法在视觉不可感知性、鲁棒性和嵌入容量方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: The rapid transmission of multimedia information has been achieved mainly by
recent advancements in the Internet's speed and information technology. In
spite of this, advancements in technology have resulted in breaches of privacy
and data security. When it comes to protecting private information in today's
Internet era, digital steganography is vital. Many academics are interested in
digital video because it has a great capability for concealing important data.
There have been a vast number of video steganography solutions developed lately
to guard against the theft of confidential data. The visual imperceptibility,
robustness, and embedding capacity of these approaches are all challenges that
must be addressed. In this paper, a novel solution to reversible video
steganography based on DWT and QR codes is proposed to address these concerns.
In order to increase the security level of the suggested method, an enhanced
ElGamal cryptosystem has also been proposed. Prior to the embedding stage, the
suggested method uses the modified ElGamal algorithm to encrypt secret QR
codes. Concurrently, it applies two-dimensional DWT on the Y-component of each
video frame resulting in LL, LH, HL, and HH sub-bands. Then, the encrypted Low
(L), Medium (M), Quantile (Q), and High (H) QR codes are embedded into the HL
sub-band, HH sub-band, U-component, and V-component of video frames,
respectively, using the LSB technique. As a consequence of extensive testing of
the approach, it was shown to be very secure and highly invisible, as well as
highly resistant to attacks from Salt & Pepper, Gaussian, Poisson, and Speckle
noises, which has an average SSIM of more than 0.91. Aside from visual
imperceptibility, the suggested method exceeds current methods in terms of PSNR
average of 52.143 dB, and embedding capacity 1 bpp.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在复杂高速运动（如羽毛球）分析中表现不足，主要因缺乏领域特定标注数据。

Method: 构建多级语义标注数据集FineBadminton，结合MLLM生成建议与人工细化；提出Hit-Centric关键帧选择和Coordinate-Guided视觉信息浓缩方法。

Result: 在FBBench上，当前MLLMs仍面临挑战，但所提方法显著提升性能。

Conclusion: FineBadminton和FBBench为细粒度视频理解和MLLMs在体育智能中的发展提供了关键支持。

Abstract: Fine-grained analysis of complex and high-speed sports like badminton
presents a significant challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
despite their notable advancements in general video understanding. This
difficulty arises primarily from the scarcity of datasets with sufficiently
rich and domain-specific annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce
FineBadminton, a novel and large-scale dataset featuring a unique multi-level
semantic annotation hierarchy (Foundational Actions, Tactical Semantics, and
Decision Evaluation) for comprehensive badminton understanding. The
construction of FineBadminton is powered by an innovative annotation pipeline
that synergistically combines MLLM-generated proposals with human refinement.
We also present FBBench, a challenging benchmark derived from FineBadminton, to
rigorously evaluate MLLMs on nuanced spatio-temporal reasoning and tactical
comprehension. Together, FineBadminton and FBBench provide a crucial ecosystem
to catalyze research in fine-grained video understanding and advance the
development of MLLMs in sports intelligence. Furthermore, we propose an
optimized baseline approach incorporating Hit-Centric Keyframe Selection to
focus on pivotal moments and Coordinate-Guided Condensation to distill salient
visual information. The results on FBBench reveal that while current MLLMs
still face significant challenges in deep sports video analysis, our proposed
strategies nonetheless achieve substantial performance gains. The project

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人脸质量评估方法泛化能力有限，而学习型方法虽性能优越但计算和存储成本高，难以实际部署。

Method: 采用三阶段渐进训练策略，逐步引入多样化数据样本并提高输入图像分辨率。

Result: 在VQualA 2025基准数据集上取得第二高分，性能与最先进方法相当或更优。

Conclusion: MSPT在轻量级网络中有效学习复杂质量特征，显著减轻灾难性遗忘，适合实际应用。

Abstract: Accurately assessing the perceptual quality of face images is crucial,
especially with the rapid progress in face restoration and generation.
Traditional quality assessment methods often struggle with the unique
characteristics of face images, limiting their generalizability. While
learning-based approaches demonstrate superior performance due to their strong
fitting capabilities, their high complexity typically incurs significant
computational and storage costs, hindering practical deployment. To address
this, we propose a lightweight face quality assessment network with Multi-Stage
Progressive Training (MSPT). Our network employs a three-stage progressive
training strategy that gradually introduces more diverse data samples and
increases input image resolution. This novel approach enables lightweight
networks to achieve high performance by effectively learning complex quality
features while significantly mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Our MSPT
achieved the second highest score on the VQualA 2025 face image quality
assessment benchmark dataset, demonstrating that MSPT achieves comparable or
better performance than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining efficient
inference.

TL;DR: AD-AVSR框架通过双向模态增强改进音频-视觉语音识别（AVSR），在噪声环境下表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AVSR方法在不对称信息条件下难以捕捉音频-视觉数据的异质性和互补性。

Method: 提出AD-AVSR框架，包括音频双流编码策略、音频感知视觉细化模块和跨模态噪声抑制掩码模块，实现双向信息流。

Result: 在LRS2和LRS3数据集上，AD-AVSR性能超越现有方法，噪声鲁棒性更强。

Conclusion: AD-AVSR通过双向增强和选择性机制，显著提升了AVSR的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) combines audio-visual modalities to
improve speech recognition, especially in noisy environments. However, most
existing methods deploy the unidirectional enhancement or symmetric fusion
manner, which limits their capability to capture heterogeneous and
complementary correlations of audio-visual data-especially under asymmetric
information conditions. To tackle these gaps, we introduce a new AVSR framework
termed AD-AVSR based on bidirectional modality enhancement. Specifically, we
first introduce the audio dual-stream encoding strategy to enrich audio
representations from multiple perspectives and intentionally establish
asymmetry to support subsequent cross-modal interactions. The enhancement
process involves two key components, Audio-aware Visual Refinement Module for
enhanced visual representations under audio guidance, and Cross-modal Noise
Suppression Masking Module which refines audio representations using visual
cues, collaboratively leading to the closed-loop and bidirectional information
flow. To further enhance correlation robustness, we adopt a threshold-based
selection mechanism to filter out irrelevant or weakly correlated audio-visual
pairs. Extensive experimental results on the LRS2 and LRS3 datasets indicate
that our AD-AVSR consistently surpasses SOTA methods in both performance and
noise robustness, highlighting the effectiveness of our model design.

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合样本内和样本间的参考上下文，显著提升了多模态特征的质量。

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis is a fundamental problem in the field of
affective computing. Although significant progress has been made in cross-modal
interaction, it remains a challenge due to the insufficient reference context
in cross-modal interactions. Current cross-modal approaches primarily focus on
leveraging modality-level reference context within a individual sample for
cross-modal feature enhancement, neglecting the potential cross-sample
relationships that can serve as sample-level reference context to enhance the
cross-modal features. To address this issue, we propose a novel multimodal
retrieval-augmented framework to simultaneously incorporate inter-sample
modality-level reference context and cross-sample sample-level reference
context to enhance the multimodal features. In particular, we first design a
contrastive cross-modal retrieval module to retrieve semantic similar samples
and enhance target modality. To endow the model to capture both inter-sample
and intra-sample information, we integrate two different types of prompts,
modality-level prompts and sample-level prompts, to generate modality-level and
sample-level reference contexts, respectively. Finally, we design a cross-modal
retrieval-augmented encoder that simultaneously leverages modality-level and
sample-level reference contexts to enhance the target modality. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our model on two
publicly available datasets.

Motivation: 短视频平台虚假新闻传播迅速且检测困难，现有方法忽视视频、上传者和事件之间的隐含关系。

Method: 构建异构图连接上传者、视频和事件节点，设计时间感知的图注意力网络，并通过重构预训练优化节点表示。

Result: 在公开数据集上，DugFND显著提升了检测性能。

Conclusion: 双重社区建模对短视频虚假新闻检测具有重要价值。

Abstract: Short video platforms have become a major medium for information sharing, but
their rapid content generation and algorithmic amplification also enable the
widespread dissemination of fake news. Detecting misinformation in short videos
is challenging due to their multi-modal nature and the limited context of
individual videos. While recent methods focus on analyzing content
signals-visual, textual, and audio-they often overlook implicit relationships
among videos, uploaders, and events. To address this gap, we propose DugFND
(Dual-community graph for fake news detection), a novel method that enhances
existing video classifiers by modeling two key community patterns: (1) uploader
communities, where uploaders with shared interests or similar content creation
patterns group together, and (2) event-driven communities, where videos related
to the same or semantically similar public events form localized clusters. We
construct a heterogeneous graph connecting uploader, video, and event nodes,
and design a time-aware heterogeneous graph attention network to enable
effective message passing. A reconstruction-based pretraining phase further
improves node representation learning. DugFND can be applied to any pre-trained
classifier. Experiments on public datasets show that our method achieves
significant performance gains, demonstrating the value of dual-community
modeling for fake news detection in short videos.

Abstract: The emergence of audio-visual foundation models underscores the importance of
reliably assessing their multi-modal understanding. The VGGSounder dataset is
commonly used as a benchmark for evaluation audio-visual classification.
However, our analysis identifies several limitations of VGGSounder, including
incomplete labelling, partially overlapping classes, and misaligned modalities.
These lead to distorted evaluations of auditory and visual capabilities. To
address these limitations, we introduce VGGSounder, a comprehensively
re-annotated, multi-label test set that extends VGGSound and is specifically
designed to evaluate audio-visual foundation models. VGGSounder features
detailed modality annotations, enabling precise analyses of modality-specific
performance. Furthermore, we reveal model limitations by analysing performance
degradation when adding another input modality with our new modality confusion
metric.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于CUDA加速的Pasur纸牌游戏计算框架，通过高效内存管理和CFR算法计算近纳什均衡，解决了游戏规则复杂和游戏树庞大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pasur游戏规则复杂且游戏树庞大，传统方法难以高效处理。本文旨在通过CUDA加速和内存优化解决这些问题。

Method: 使用PyTorch CUDA张量处理规则复杂性，将游戏树分解为实际游戏状态和继承分数，采用轮次逆向训练策略降低计算复杂度。

Result: 构建了包含超过10^9个节点的完整游戏树，并通过大规模自玩模拟估计了每副牌的公平价值。

Conclusion: 该框架可扩展至其他多轮次强化学习问题，如回合制策略游戏或金融市场中的顺序交易决策。

Abstract: Pasur is a fishing card game played over six rounds and is played similarly
to games such as Cassino and Scopa, and Bastra. This paper introduces a
CUDA-accelerated computational framework for simulating Pasur, emphasizing
efficient memory management. We use our framework to compute near-Nash
equilibria via Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR), a well-known algorithm
for solving large imperfect-information games.
  Solving Pasur presents unique challenges due to its intricate rules and the
large size of its game tree. We handle rule complexity using PyTorch CUDA
tensors and to address the memory-intensive nature of the game, we decompose
the game tree into two key components: (1) actual game states, and (2)
inherited scores from previous rounds. We construct the Full Game Tree by
pairing card states with accumulated scores in the Unfolding Process. This
design reduces memory overhead by storing only essential strategy values and
node connections. To further manage computational complexity, we apply a
round-by-round backward training strategy, starting from the final round and
recursively propagating average utilities to earlier stages. Our approach
constructs the complete game tree, which on average consists of over $10^9$
nodes. We provide detailed implementation snippets.
  After computing a near-Nash equilibrium strategy, we train a tree-based model
to predict these strategies for use during gameplay. We then estimate the fair
value of each deck through large-scale self-play between equilibrium strategies
by simulating, for instance, 10,000 games per matchup, executed in parallel
using GPU acceleration.
  Similar frameworks can be extended to other reinforcement learning algorithms
where the action tree naturally decomposes into multiple rounds such as
turn-based strategy games or sequential trading decisions in financial markets.

Conclusion: SciLink不仅提高了研究效率，还通过系统分析所有观察结果，为偶然发现创造了环境，弥合了自动化实验与开放式科学探索之间的差距。

Abstract: The history of science is punctuated by serendipitous discoveries, where
unexpected observations, rather than targeted hypotheses, opened new fields of
inquiry. While modern autonomous laboratories excel at accelerating hypothesis
testing, their optimization for efficiency risks overlooking these crucial,
unplanned findings. To address this gap, we introduce SciLink, an open-source,
multi-agent artificial intelligence framework designed to operationalize
serendipity in materials research by creating a direct, automated link between
experimental observation, novelty assessment, and theoretical simulations. The
framework employs a hybrid AI strategy where specialized machine learning
models perform quantitative analysis of experimental data, while large language
models handle higher-level reasoning. These agents autonomously convert raw
data from materials characterization techniques into falsifiable scientific
claims, which are then quantitatively scored for novelty against the published
literature. We demonstrate the framework's versatility across diverse research
scenarios, showcasing its application to atomic-resolution and hyperspectral
data, its capacity to integrate real-time human expert guidance, and its
ability to close the research loop by proposing targeted follow-up experiments.
By systematically analyzing all observations and contextualizing them, SciLink
provides a practical framework for AI-driven materials research that not only
enhances efficiency but also actively cultivates an environment ripe for
serendipitous discoveries, thereby bridging the gap between automated
experimentation and open-ended scientific exploration.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated potential in autonomous
driving. However, two critical challenges hinder their development: (1)
Existing VLA architectures are typically based on imitation learning in
open-loop setup which tends to capture the recorded behaviors in the dataset,
leading to suboptimal and constrained performance, (2) Close-loop training
relies heavily on high-fidelity sensor simulation, where domain gaps and
computational inefficiencies pose significant barriers. In this paper, we
introduce IRL-VLA, a novel close-loop Reinforcement Learning via
\textbf{I}nverse \textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning reward world model
with a self-built VLA approach. Our framework proceeds in a three-stage
paradigm: In the first stage, we propose a VLA architecture and pretrain the
VLA policy via imitation learning. In the second stage, we construct a
lightweight reward world model via inverse reinforcement learning to enable
efficient close-loop reward computation. To further enhance planning
performance, finally, we design specialized reward world model guidence
reinforcement learning via PPO(Proximal Policy Optimization) to effectively
balance the safety incidents, comfortable driving, and traffic efficiency. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in NAVSIM v2 end-to-end driving
benchmark, 1st runner up in CVPR2025 Autonomous Grand Challenge. We hope that
our framework will accelerate VLA research in close-loop autonomous driving.

Motivation: MLLMs在对象计数上的不足限制了其实际应用可靠性，现有基准无法测试复杂场景。

Method: 引入CountQA基准，包含1,500个问题-答案对，评估15种MLLMs。

Result: 最佳模型准确率仅42.9%，性能随对象数量增加而下降。

Conclusion: CountQA为改进MLLMs的计数能力提供了工具，推动更全面的模型发展。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable fluency in
understanding visual scenes, yet they exhibit a critical lack in a fundamental
cognitive skill: object counting. This blind spot severely limits their
reliability in real-world applications. To date, this capability has been
largely unevaluated in complex scenarios, as existing benchmarks either feature
sparse object densities or are confined to specific visual domains, failing to
test models under realistic conditions. Addressing this gap, we introduce
CountQA, a challenging new benchmark designed to probe this deficiency.
Comprising over 1,500 question-answer pairs, CountQA features real-world images
with high object density, clutter, and occlusion. We investigate this weakness
by evaluating 15 prominent MLLMs on the CountQA benchmark and reveal that the
top-performing model achieves a mere 42.9% accuracy, with performance declining
as object counts rise. By providing a dedicated benchmark to diagnose and
rectify this core weakness, CountQA paves the way for a new generation of MLLMs
that are not only descriptively fluent but also numerically grounded and
spatially aware. We will open-source the dataset and code upon paper acceptance
to foster further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FCA在变异性分析中潜力巨大，但如何利用其数学属性并不直观，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 收集并分析FCA框架中与变异性分析相关的关键属性。

Result: 明确了FCA属性如何用于解释概念结构中的变异性信息。

Conclusion: FCA的关键属性为变异性分析提供了有效工具，本文为其应用提供了指导。

Abstract: Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a mathematical framework for knowledge
representation and discovery. It performs a hierarchical clustering over a set
of objects described by attributes, resulting in conceptual structures in which
objects are organized depending on the attributes they share. These conceptual
structures naturally highlight commonalities and variabilities among similar
objects by categorizing them into groups which are then arranged by similarity,
making it particularly appropriate for variability extraction and analysis.
Despite the potential of FCA, determining which of its properties can be
leveraged for variability-related tasks (and how) is not always
straightforward, partly due to the mathematical orientation of its foundational
literature. This paper attempts to bridge part of this gap by gathering a
selection of properties of the framework which are essential to variability
analysis, and how they can be used to interpret diverse variability information
within the resulting conceptual structures.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在零样本CTMM中优于现有方法16.8%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过知识共享和误差缓解策略，显著提升了零样本CTMM的准确性和适应性。

Abstract: Cellular Trajectory Map-Matching (CTMM) aims to align cellular location
sequences to road networks, which is a necessary preprocessing in
location-based services on web platforms like Google Maps, including navigation
and route optimization. Current approaches mainly rely on ID-based features and
region-specific data to learn correlations between cell towers and roads,
limiting their adaptability to unexplored areas. To enable high-accuracy CTMM
without additional training in target regions, Zero-shot CTMM requires to
extract not only region-adaptive features, but also sequential and location
uncertainty to alleviate positioning errors in cellular data. In this paper, we
propose a pixel-based trajectory calibration assistant for zero-shot CTMM,
which takes advantage of transferable geospatial knowledge to calibrate
pixelated trajectory, and then guide the path-finding process at the road
network level. To enhance knowledge sharing across similar regions, a Gaussian
mixture model is incorporated into VAE, enabling the identification of
scenario-adaptive experts through soft clustering. To mitigate high positioning
errors, a spatial-temporal awareness module is designed to capture sequential
features and location uncertainty, thereby facilitating the inference of
approximate user positions. Finally, a constrained path-finding algorithm is
employed to reconstruct the road ID sequence, ensuring topological validity
within the road network. This process is guided by the calibrated trajectory
while optimizing for the shortest feasible path, thus minimizing unnecessary
detours. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms existing
methods in zero-shot CTMM by 16.8\%.

Motivation: 解决基于规则的知识图谱补全方法中规则数量过多导致解释性下降的问题。

Method: 从训练数据中发现规则上下文，利用概率电路学习概率分布，快速达到完整规则集的性能。

Result: 规则数量减少70-96%，性能优于基线31倍，保留91%的峰值性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在8个基准数据集上验证了有效性，为基于规则的推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Rule-based methods for knowledge graph completion provide explainable results
but often require a significantly large number of rules to achieve competitive
performance. This can hinder explainability due to overwhelmingly large rule
sets. We discover rule contexts (meaningful subsets of rules that work
together) from training data and use learned probability distribution (i.e.
probabilistic circuits) over these rule contexts to more rapidly achieve
performance of the full rule set. Our approach achieves a 70-96% reduction in
number of rules used while outperforming baseline by up to 31$\times$ when
using equivalent minimal number of rules and preserves 91% of peak baseline
performance even when comparing our minimal rule sets against baseline's full
rule sets. We show that our framework is grounded in well-known semantics of
probabilistic logic, does not require independence assumptions, and that our
tractable inference procedure provides both approximate lower bounds and exact
probability of a given query. The efficacy of our method is validated by
empirical studies on 8 standard benchmark datasets where we show competitive
performance by using only a fraction of the rules required by AnyBURL's
standard inference method, the current state-of-the-art for rule-based
knowledge graph completion. This work may have further implications for general
probabilistic reasoning over learned sets of rules.

Abstract: Differentiable inductive logic programming (ILP) techniques have proven
effective at finding approximate rule-based solutions to link prediction and
node classification problems on knowledge graphs; however, the common
assumption of chain-like rule structure can hamper the performance and
interpretability of existing approaches. We introduce GLIDR, a differentiable
rule learning method that models the inference of logic rules with more
expressive syntax than previous methods. GLIDR uses a differentiable message
passing inference algorithm that generalizes previous chain-like rule learning
methods to allow rules with features like branches and cycles. GLIDR has a
simple and expressive rule search space which is parameterized by a limit on
the maximum number of free variables that may be included in a rule. Explicit
logic rules can be extracted from the weights of a GLIDR model for use with
symbolic solvers. We demonstrate that GLIDR can significantly outperform
existing rule learning methods on knowledge graph completion tasks and even
compete with embedding methods despite the inherent disadvantage of being a
structure-only prediction method. We show that rules extracted from GLIDR
retain significant predictive performance, and that GLIDR is highly robust to
training data noise. Finally, we demonstrate that GLIDR can be chained with
deep neural networks and optimized end-to-end for rule learning on arbitrary
data modalities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MultiMedEdit是首个针对临床多模态任务的知识编辑（KE）基准，揭示了当前方法在复杂临床工作流中的局限性，并为未来发展提供了基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识编辑研究多集中于文本领域，缺乏对多模态医学场景的关注，而医学KE需要结合视觉推理以支持临床决策。

Method: 提出MultiMedEdit基准，涵盖理解和推理任务类型，定义三维度量（可靠性、通用性、局部性），并支持跨范式比较。

Result: 实验表明当前方法在泛化和长尾推理方面表现不佳，尤其在复杂临床工作流中。效率分析揭示了实际部署中的权衡。

Conclusion: MultiMedEdit揭示了当前方法的不足，为未来开发临床稳健的KE技术奠定了基础。

Abstract: Knowledge editing (KE) provides a scalable approach for updating factual
knowledge in large language models without full retraining. While previous
studies have demonstrated effectiveness in general domains and medical QA
tasks, little attention has been paid to KE in multimodal medical scenarios.
Unlike text-only settings, medical KE demands integrating updated knowledge
with visual reasoning to support safe and interpretable clinical decisions. To
address this gap, we propose MultiMedEdit, the first benchmark tailored to
evaluating KE in clinical multimodal tasks. Our framework spans both
understanding and reasoning task types, defines a three-dimensional metric
suite (reliability, generality, and locality), and supports cross-paradigm
comparisons across general and domain-specific models. We conduct extensive
experiments under single-editing and lifelong-editing settings. Results suggest
that current methods struggle with generalization and long-tail reasoning,
particularly in complex clinical workflows. We further present an efficiency
analysis (e.g., edit latency, memory footprint), revealing practical trade-offs
in real-world deployment across KE paradigms. Overall, MultiMedEdit not only
reveals the limitations of current approaches but also provides a solid
foundation for developing clinically robust knowledge editing techniques in the
future.

Motivation: 由于MIP问题的组合性质，计算资源需求高，并行化成为加速求解的关键策略。Balans的并行潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 引入ParBalans，结合求解器级和算法级并行，优化Balans的并行能力。

Result: 实验表明，ParBalans在复杂MIP实例上表现优异，与商业求解器Gurobi竞争。

Conclusion: ParBalans通过并行化显著提升MIP求解效率，尤其在困难问题上表现突出。

Abstract: Solving Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) problems often requires substantial
computational resources due to their combinatorial nature. Parallelization has
emerged as a critical strategy to accelerate solution times and enhance
scalability to tackle large, complex instances. This paper investigates the
parallelization capabilities of Balans, a recently proposed multi-armed
bandits-based adaptive large neighborhood search for MIPs. While Balans's
modular architecture inherently supports parallel exploration of diverse
parameter configurations, this potential has not been thoroughly examined. To
address this gap, we introduce ParBalans, an extension that leverages both
solver-level and algorithmic-level parallelism to improve performance on
challenging MIP instances. Our experimental results demonstrate that ParBalans
exhibits competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art commercial
solver Gurobi, particularly on hard optimization benchmarks.

Motivation: 随着无人机网络在敏感应用中的需求增长，确保可靠连接和隐蔽通信变得至关重要。动态移动性和暴露风险是主要挑战。

Method: 采用GDPO方法生成稀疏但连接良好的拓扑结构，并结合SG激励机制引导无人机选择支持协作和隐蔽通信的行为。

Result: 实验验证了框架在模型收敛、拓扑生成质量和隐蔽通信性能提升方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能有效应对无人机网络的动态性和隐蔽通信需求。

Abstract: With the growing demand for Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks in
sensitive applications, such as urban monitoring, emergency response, and
secure sensing, ensuring reliable connectivity and covert communication has
become increasingly vital. However, dynamic mobility and exposure risks pose
significant challenges. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a
self-organizing UAV network framework combining Graph Diffusion-based Policy
Optimization (GDPO) with a Stackelberg Game (SG)-based incentive mechanism. The
GDPO method uses generative AI to dynamically generate sparse but
well-connected topologies, enabling flexible adaptation to changing node
distributions and Ground User (GU) demands. Meanwhile, the Stackelberg Game
(SG)-based incentive mechanism guides self-interested UAVs to choose relay
behaviors and neighbor links that support cooperation and enhance covert
communication. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of model convergence, topology
generation quality, and enhancement of covert communication performance.

Motivation: 超低比特LLM模型在资源受限环境（如边缘设备和AI PC）中具有潜力，但现有推理运行时的计算效率尚未充分探索。

Method: 设计并实现了针对现代CPU优化的1-bit和2-bit微内核，集成到PyTorch-TPP框架中，进行端到端推理测试。

Result: 2-bit模型推理效率比当前SOTA运行时bitnet.cpp快2.2倍，比16-bit模型快7倍。

Conclusion: 优化后的运行时推动了超低比特LLM模型在资源受限设备上的高效部署。

Abstract: The advent of ultra-low-bit LLM models (1/1.58/2-bit), which match the
perplexity and end-task performance of their full-precision counterparts using
the same model size, is ushering in a new era of LLM inference for
resource-constrained environments such as edge devices and AI PCs. While these
quantization advances promise models that are more cost-effective in terms of
latency, memory, throughput, and energy consumption, the computational
efficiency of state-of-the-art (SOTA) inference runtimes (e.g., bitnet.cpp)
used to deploy them remains underexplored. In this work, we take a bottom-up
approach: we first design and implement 1-bit and 2-bit microkernels optimized
for modern CPUs, achieving peak computational efficiency across a variety of
CPU platforms. We integrate these microkernels into a state-of-the-art LLM
inference framework, namely PyTorch-TPP, and present end-to-end inference
results with 2-bit models that outperform the current SOTA runtime bitnet.cpp
by up to 2.2x, and deliver up to 7x speedup compared to the 16-bit model
inference. Our optimized runtime advances the state of LLM inference on AI PCs
and edge devices, paving the way for efficient deployment of ultra-low-bit LLM
models.

Motivation: 基于人类学习理论（如最近发展区ZPD），旨在提升LLMs在动态任务中的适应性和安全性。

Method: 结合自然语言边界提示和控制模式，采用模糊支架逻辑和适应规则，无需微调或外部协调。

Result: 在智能辅导模拟中，框架在支架质量、适应性和教学对齐方面优于标准提示方法。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅适用于教育领域，还可用于其他交互密集型任务，为LLMs在不确定或动态环境中提供可解释、目标对齐的行为。

Abstract: We introduce a modular prompting framework that supports safer and more
adaptive use of large language models (LLMs) across dynamic, user-centered
tasks. Grounded in human learning theory, particularly the Zone of Proximal
Development (ZPD), our method combines a natural language boundary prompt with
a control schema encoded with fuzzy scaffolding logic and adaptation rules.
This architecture enables LLMs to modulate behavior in response to user state
without requiring fine-tuning or external orchestration. In a simulated
intelligent tutoring setting, the framework improves scaffolding quality,
adaptivity, and instructional alignment across multiple models, outperforming
standard prompting baselines. Evaluation is conducted using rubric-based LLM
graders at scale. While initially developed for education, the framework has
shown promise in other interaction-heavy domains, such as procedural content
generation for games. Designed for safe deployment, it provides a reusable
methodology for structuring interpretable, goal-aligned LLM behavior in
uncertain or evolving contexts.

Conclusion: 该框架通过自然语言交互和语义引导，显著改善了体数据探索的效率和用户体验。

Abstract: Exploring volumetric data is crucial for interpreting scientific datasets.
However, selecting optimal viewpoints for effective navigation can be
challenging, particularly for users without extensive domain expertise or
familiarity with 3D navigation. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
that leverages natural language interaction to enhance volumetric data
exploration. Our approach encodes volumetric blocks to capture and
differentiate underlying structures. It further incorporates a CLIP Score
mechanism, which provides semantic information to the blocks to guide
navigation. The navigation is empowered by a reinforcement learning framework
that leverage these semantic cues to efficiently search for and identify
desired viewpoints that align with the user's intent. The selected viewpoints
are evaluated using CLIP Score to ensure that they best reflect the user
queries. By automating viewpoint selection, our method improves the efficiency
of volumetric data navigation and enhances the interpretability of complex
scientific phenomena.

Abstract: The mainstream paradigm of remote sensing image interpretation has long been
dominated by vision-centered models, which rely on visual features for semantic
understanding. However, these models face inherent limitations in handling
multi-modal reasoning, semantic abstraction, and interactive decision-making.
While recent advances have introduced Large Language Models (LLMs) into remote
sensing workflows, existing studies primarily focus on downstream applications,
lacking a unified theoretical framework that explains the cognitive role of
language. This review advocates a paradigm shift from vision-centered to
language-centered remote sensing interpretation. Drawing inspiration from the
Global Workspace Theory (GWT) of human cognition, We propose a
language-centered framework for remote sensing interpretation that treats LLMs
as the cognitive central hub integrating perceptual, task, knowledge and action
spaces to enable unified understanding, reasoning, and decision-making. We
first explore the potential of LLMs as the central cognitive component in
remote sensing interpretation, and then summarize core technical challenges,
including unified multimodal representation, knowledge association, and
reasoning and decision-making. Furthermore, we construct a global
workspace-driven interpretation mechanism and review how language-centered
solutions address each challenge. Finally, we outline future research
directions from four perspectives: adaptive alignment of multimodal data, task
understanding under dynamic knowledge constraints, trustworthy reasoning, and
autonomous interaction. This work aims to provide a conceptual foundation for
the next generation of remote sensing interpretation systems and establish a
roadmap toward cognition-driven intelligent geospatial analysis.

Method: MACA方法通过多级优势函数进行显式反事实推理，结合注意力框架识别智能体间的相关性，并构建多级优势指导策略学习。

Result: 在Starcraft v1&v2任务上的实验表明，MACA在复杂信用分配场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: MACA通过多级优势信用分配，有效解决了多智能体协作中的信用分配问题，适用于复杂任务。

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) aims to coordinate
multiple agents to achieve a common goal. A key challenge in MARL is credit
assignment, which involves assessing each agent's contribution to the shared
reward. Given the diversity of tasks, agents may perform different types of
coordination, with rewards attributed to diverse and often overlapping agent
subsets. In this work, we formalize the credit assignment level as the number
of agents cooperating to obtain a reward, and address scenarios with multiple
coexisting levels. We introduce a multi-level advantage formulation that
performs explicit counterfactual reasoning to infer credits across distinct
levels. Our method, Multi-level Advantage Credit Assignment (MACA), captures
agent contributions at multiple levels by integrating advantage functions that
reason about individual, joint, and correlated actions. Utilizing an
attention-based framework, MACA identifies correlated agent relationships and
constructs multi-level advantages to guide policy learning. Comprehensive
experiments on challenging Starcraft v1\&v2 tasks demonstrate MACA's superior
performance, underscoring its efficacy in complex credit assignment scenarios.

Result: 发现当前MLLMs在多个维度存在局限性，为模型改进和教育应用提供指导。

Conclusion: MDK12-Bench为MLLMs的评估和改进提供了新方向，尤其在AI辅助教育领域有潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which integrate language and visual
cues for problem-solving, are crucial for advancing artificial general
intelligence (AGI). However, current benchmarks for measuring the intelligence
of MLLMs suffer from limited scale, narrow coverage, and unstructured
knowledge, offering only static and undifferentiated evaluations. To bridge
this gap, we introduce MDK12-Bench, a large-scale multidisciplinary benchmark
built from real-world K-12 exams spanning six disciplines with 141K instances
and 6,225 knowledge points organized in a six-layer taxonomy. Covering five
question formats with difficulty and year annotations, it enables comprehensive
evaluation to capture the extent to which MLLMs perform over four dimensions:
1) difficulty levels, 2) temporal (cross-year) shifts, 3) contextual shifts,
and 4) knowledge-driven reasoning. We propose a novel dynamic evaluation
framework that introduces unfamiliar visual, textual, and question form shifts
to challenge model generalization while improving benchmark objectivity and
longevity by mitigating data contamination. We further evaluate knowledge-point
reference-augmented generation (KP-RAG) to examine the role of knowledge in
problem-solving. Key findings reveal limitations in current MLLMs in multiple
aspects and provide guidance for enhancing model robustness, interpretability,
and AI-assisted education.

Result: 该方法成功解决了CP-Bench基准集中的所有101个问题。

Conclusion: 约束建模任务需要通用编码工具与提示编码的领域知识结合，而非专用代理架构或预定义流程。

Abstract: Translating natural language problem descriptions into formal constraint
models remains a fundamental challenge in constraint programming, requiring
deep expertise in both the problem domain and modeling frameworks. Previous
approaches to automating this translation have employed fixed workflows with
predetermined modeling steps, failing on a significant number of benchmark
problems. We present a new approach using a pure agentic strategy without any
fixed pipeline. We developed a general-purpose Python coding agent based on the
ReAct (Reason and Act) principle, utilizing a persistent IPython kernel for
stateful code execution and iterative development. Rather than embedding
constraint programming logic into the agent architecture, domain-specific
expertise is injected solely through a carefully crafted project prompt. The
agent combines this prompt-encoded knowledge with access to file operations and
code execution tools, enabling it to test hypotheses, debug failures, and
verify solutions dynamically. Implemented in just a few hundred lines of code,
this architecture successfully solves all 101 problems of the CP-Bench
constraint programming benchmark set. The results suggest that constraint
modeling tasks require the combination of general coding tools and domain
expertise encoded in prompts, rather than specialized agent architectures or
predefined workflows.

Abstract: Timely and accurate severe weather warnings are critical for disaster
mitigation. However, current forecasting systems remain heavily reliant on
manual expert interpretation, introducing subjectivity and significant
operational burdens. With the rapid development of AI technologies, the
end-to-end "AI weather station" is gradually emerging as a new trend in
predicting severe weather events. Three core challenges impede the development
of end-to-end AI severe weather system: (1) scarcity of severe weather event
samples; (2) imperfect alignment between high-dimensional meteorological data
and textual warnings; (3) existing multimodal language models are unable to
handle high-dimensional meteorological data and struggle to fully capture the
complex dependencies across temporal sequences, vertical pressure levels, and
spatial dimensions. To address these challenges, we introduce MP-Bench, the
first large-scale temporal multimodal dataset for severe weather events
prediction, comprising 421,363 pairs of raw multi-year meteorological data and
corresponding text caption, covering a wide range of severe weather scenarios
across China. On top of this dataset, we develop a meteorology multimodal large
model (MMLM) that directly ingests 4D meteorological inputs. In addition, it is
designed to accommodate the unique characteristics of 4D meteorological data
flow, incorporating three plug-and-play adaptive fusion modules that enable
dynamic feature extraction and integration across temporal sequences, vertical
pressure layers, and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments on MP-Bench
demonstrate that MMLM performs exceptionally well across multiple tasks,
highlighting its effectiveness in severe weather understanding and marking a
key step toward realizing automated, AI-driven weather forecasting systems. Our
source code and dataset will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 传统奖励机器（RMs）只能处理正则语言表示的行为，而pdRMs通过扩展为下推自动机，能够处理更复杂的确定性上下文无关语言行为，提升强化学习的表达能力。

Method: 提出两种基于pdRM的策略：一种可以访问整个堆栈，另一种仅能访问堆栈顶部的$k$个符号。并提供了检查两种策略是否达到相同最优期望奖励的方法。

Result: 理论证明了pdRMs的表达能力，并分析了学习问题的空间复杂度。实验表明，pdRMs可以训练代理完成确定性上下文无关语言表示的任务。

Conclusion: pdRMs扩展了奖励机器的表达能力，能够处理更复杂的行为，为强化学习提供了新的工具。

Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) are automata structures that encode (non-Markovian)
reward functions for reinforcement learning (RL). RMs can reward any behaviour
representable in regular languages and, when paired with RL algorithms that
exploit RM structure, have been shown to significantly improve sample
efficiency in many domains. In this work, we present pushdown reward machines
(pdRMs), an extension of reward machines based on deterministic pushdown
automata. pdRMs can recognize and reward temporally extended behaviours
representable in deterministic context-free languages, making them more
expressive than reward machines. We introduce two variants of pdRM-based
policies, one which has access to the entire stack of the pdRM, and one which
can only access the top $k$ symbols (for a given constant $k$) of the stack. We
propose a procedure to check when the two kinds of policies (for a given
environment, pdRM, and constant $k$) achieve the same optimal expected reward.
We then provide theoretical results establishing the expressive power of pdRMs,
and space complexity results about the proposed learning problems. Finally, we
provide experimental results showing how agents can be trained to perform tasks
representable in deterministic context-free languages using pdRMs.

Motivation: GDBA在解决DCOPs时容易陷入局部最优，且性能提升有限。论文旨在通过改进GDBA的缺陷，提出更高效的算法。

Method: 提出DGLS框架，包括自适应约束违反条件、惩罚蒸发机制和同步更新方案，以解决GDBA的三大问题。

Result: DGLS在标准基准测试中表现优异，尤其在结构化问题上显著优于现有基线（3.77%--66.3%）。

Conclusion: DGLS通过改进GDBA的缺陷，显著提升了DCOPs的求解性能，具有理论和实践价值。

Abstract: Local search is an important class of incomplete algorithms for solving
Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) but it often converges to
poor local optima. While GDBA provides a comprehensive rule set to escape
premature convergence, its empirical benefits remain marginal on general-valued
problems. In this work, we systematically examine GDBA and identify three
factors that potentially lead to its inferior performance, i.e.,
over-aggressive constraint violation conditions, unbounded penalty
accumulation, and uncoordinated penalty updates. To address these issues, we
propose Distributed Guided Local Search (DGLS), a novel GLS framework for DCOPs
that incorporates an adaptive violation condition to selectively penalize
constraints with high cost, a penalty evaporation mechanism to control the
magnitude of penalization, and a synchronization scheme for coordinated penalty
updates. We theoretically show that the penalty values are bounded, and agents
play a potential game in our DGLS. Our extensive empirical results on various
standard benchmarks demonstrate the great superiority of DGLS over
state-of-the-art baselines. Particularly, compared to Damped Max-sum with high
damping factors (e.g., 0.7 or 0.9), our DGLS achieves competitive performance
on general-valued problems, and outperforms it by significant margins
(\textbf{3.77\%--66.3\%}) on structured problems in terms of anytime results.

Motivation: 解决交互式定理证明器中手动形式化的高成本和专家依赖问题，同时应对自动形式化中的模型幻觉和语义鸿沟挑战。

Method: 提出CRAMF框架，利用Mathlib4构建概念定义知识库，采用上下文查询增强和双通道混合检索策略。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，CRAMF显著提升了翻译准确率，最高达62.1%，平均提升29.9%。

Conclusion: CRAMF通过检索增强和上下文优化，有效提升了自动形式化的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Interactive theorem provers (ITPs) require manual formalization, which is
labor-intensive and demands expert knowledge. While automated formalization
offers a potential solution, it faces two major challenges: model hallucination
(e.g., undefined predicates, symbol misuse, and version incompatibility) and
the semantic gap caused by ambiguous or missing premises in natural language
descriptions. To address these issues, we propose CRAMF, a Concept-driven
Retrieval-Augmented Mathematical Formalization framework. CRAMF enhances
LLM-based autoformalization by retrieving formal definitions of core
mathematical concepts, providing contextual grounding during code generation.
However, applying retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in this setting is
non-trivial due to the lack of structured knowledge bases, the polymorphic
nature of mathematical concepts, and the high precision required in formal
retrieval. We introduce a framework for automatically constructing a
concept-definition knowledge base from Mathlib4, the standard mathematical
library for the Lean 4 theorem prover, indexing over 26,000 formal definitions
and 1,000+ core mathematical concepts. To address conceptual polymorphism, we
propose contextual query augmentation with domain- and application-level
signals. In addition, we design a dual-channel hybrid retrieval strategy with
reranking to ensure accurate and relevant definition retrieval. Experiments on
miniF2F, ProofNet, and our newly proposed AdvancedMath benchmark show that
CRAMF can be seamlessly integrated into LLM-based autoformalizers, yielding

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文利用Transformer模型的可解释性，通过自注意力机制分析多模态学习网络，用于子田级别的作物产量预测，并提出了两种特征归因方法（AR和GA）和一种模态归因方法（WMA）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习在农业中具有潜力，但模型的可解释性常被忽视。本研究旨在利用Transformer模型的固有可解释性，提升多模态学习网络的可解释性。

Method: 使用自注意力机制，提出Attention Rollout (AR)和Generic Attention (GA)两种特征归因方法，以及Weighted Modality Activation (WMA)模态归因方法，并与Shapley Value Sampling (SVS)对比。

Result: Transformer模型在子田和田间级别的预测中表现优于卷积和循环网络，R2分数分别高出0.10和0.04。AR在时间归因上更稳健，WMA揭示了模态归因的差异模式。

Conclusion: Transformer模型在多模态学习中具有优越性，AR和WMA方法为模型解释提供了新视角，有助于结合农学知识理解预测结果。

Abstract: Multimodal learning enables various machine learning tasks to benefit from
diverse data sources, effectively mimicking the interplay of different factors
in real-world applications, particularly in agriculture. While the
heterogeneous nature of involved data modalities may necessitate the design of
complex architectures, the model interpretability is often overlooked. In this
study, we leverage the intrinsic explainability of Transformer-based models to
explain multimodal learning networks, focusing on the task of crop yield
prediction at the subfield level. The large datasets used cover various crops,
regions, and years, and include four different input modalities: multispectral
satellite and weather time series, terrain elevation maps and soil properties.
Based on the self-attention mechanism, we estimate feature attributions using
two methods, namely the Attention Rollout (AR) and Generic Attention (GA), and
evaluate their performance against Shapley-based model-agnostic estimations,
Shapley Value Sampling (SVS). Additionally, we propose the Weighted Modality
Activation (WMA) method to assess modality attributions and compare it with SVS
attributions. Our findings indicate that Transformer-based models outperform
other architectures, specifically convolutional and recurrent networks,
achieving R2 scores that are higher by 0.10 and 0.04 at the subfield and field
levels, respectively. AR is shown to provide more robust and reliable temporal
attributions, as confirmed through qualitative and quantitative evaluation,
compared to GA and SVS values. Information about crop phenology stages was
leveraged to interpret the explanation results in the light of established
agronomic knowledge. Furthermore, modality attributions revealed varying
patterns across the two methods compared.[...]

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM是否能够模拟人类心理学并替代心理学研究中的人类参与者。

Method: 通过概念论证和实证证据（如语义变化对反应的影响）分析LLM的可靠性。

Result: LLM在心理学研究中表现不可靠，与人类反应存在显著差异。

Conclusion: LLM不能模拟人类心理学，建议心理学研究者将其视为需验证的工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs),such as ChatGPT, are increasingly used in
research, ranging from simple writing assistance to complex data annotation
tasks. Recently, some research has suggested that LLMs may even be able to
simulate human psychology and can, hence, replace human participants in
psychological studies. We caution against this approach. We provide conceptual
arguments against the hypothesis that LLMs simulate human psychology. We then
present empiric evidence illustrating our arguments by demonstrating that
slight changes to wording that correspond to large changes in meaning lead to
notable discrepancies between LLMs' and human responses, even for the recent
CENTAUR model that was specifically fine-tuned on psychological responses.
Additionally, different LLMs show very different responses to novel items,
further illustrating their lack of reliability. We conclude that LLMs do not
simulate human psychology and recommend that psychological researchers should
treat LLMs as useful but fundamentally unreliable tools that need to be
validated against human responses for every new application.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models has fundamentally shifted the
bottleneck in AI development from computational power to data availability-with
countless valuable datasets remaining hidden across specialized repositories,
research appendices, and domain platforms. As reasoning capabilities and deep
research methodologies continue to evolve, a critical question emerges: can AI
agents transcend conventional search to systematically discover any dataset
that meets specific user requirements, enabling truly autonomous demand-driven
data curation? We introduce DatasetResearch, the first comprehensive benchmark
evaluating AI agents' ability to discover and synthesize datasets from 208
real-world demands across knowledge-intensive and reasoning-intensive tasks.
Our tri-dimensional evaluation framework reveals a stark reality: even advanced
deep research systems achieve only 22% score on our challenging
DatasetResearch-pro subset, exposing the vast gap between current capabilities
and perfect dataset discovery. Our analysis uncovers a fundamental
dichotomy-search agents excel at knowledge tasks through retrieval breadth,
while synthesis agents dominate reasoning challenges via structured
generation-yet both catastrophically fail on "corner cases" outside existing
distributions. These findings establish the first rigorous baseline for dataset
discovery agents and illuminate the path toward AI systems capable of finding
any dataset in the digital universe. Our benchmark and comprehensive analysis
provide the foundation for the next generation of self-improving AI systems and

Motivation: LLMs存在可信性问题，现有修复方法成本高、速度慢或缺乏鲁棒性，需要一种轻量级、自动化的解决方案。

Method: 提出MASteer框架，包含AutoTester（多智能体生成样本）和AutoRepairer（自适应策略选择），通过表示工程实现训练无关的修复。

Result: 在LLaMA-3.1-8B-Chat和Qwen-3-8B-Chat上分别提升15.36%和4.21%的指标，同时保持模型通用能力。

Conclusion: MASteer具有强鲁棒性、泛化能力和实用价值，为可信性修复提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face persistent and evolving trustworthiness
issues, motivating developers to seek automated and flexible repair methods
that enable convenient deployment across diverse scenarios. Existing repair
methods like supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) are costly and slow, while prompt engineering lacks robustness
and scalability. Representation engineering, which steers model behavior by
injecting targeted concept vectors during inference, offers a lightweight,
training-free alternative. However, current approaches depend on manually
crafted samples and fixed steering strategies, limiting automation and
adaptability. To overcome these challenges, we propose MASteer, the first
end-to-end framework for trustworthiness repair in LLMs based on representation
engineering. MASteer integrates two core components: AutoTester, a multi-agent
system that generates diverse, high-quality steer samples tailored to developer
needs; and AutoRepairer, which constructs adaptive steering strategies with
anchor vectors for automated, context-aware strategy selection during
inference. Experiments on standard and customized trustworthiness tasks show
MASteer consistently outperforms baselines, improving metrics by 15.36% on
LLaMA-3.1-8B-Chat and 4.21% on Qwen-3-8B-Chat, while maintaining general model
capabilities. MASteer demonstrates strong robustness, generalization, and
practical value for scalable, efficient trustworthiness repair.

Result: 在多种证明系统下评估，展示了内存使用、运行时间和电路行为的性能数据。

Conclusion: DSperse通过灵活的验证边界支持可扩展的、针对性的验证策略，适应多样化部署需求。

Abstract: DSperse is a modular framework for distributed machine learning inference
with strategic cryptographic verification. Operating within the emerging
paradigm of distributed zero-knowledge machine learning, DSperse avoids the
high cost and rigidity of full-model circuitization by enabling targeted
verification of strategically chosen subcomputations. These verifiable
segments, or "slices", may cover part or all of the inference pipeline, with
global consistency enforced through audit, replication, or economic incentives.
This architecture supports a pragmatic form of trust minimization, localizing
zero-knowledge proofs to the components where they provide the greatest value.
We evaluate DSperse using multiple proving systems and report empirical results
on memory usage, runtime, and circuit behavior under sliced and unsliced
configurations. By allowing proof boundaries to align flexibly with the model's
logical structure, DSperse supports scalable, targeted verification strategies
suited to diverse deployment needs.

Abstract: With recent and rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI),
understanding the foundation of purposeful behaviour in autonomous agents is
crucial for developing safe and efficient systems. While artificial neural
networks have dominated the path to AI, recent studies are exploring the
potential of biologically based systems, such as networks of living biological
neuronal networks. Along with promises of high power and data efficiency, these
systems may also inform more explainable and biologically plausible models. In
this work, we propose a framework rooted in active inference, a general theory
of behaviour, to model decision-making in embodied agents. Using
experiment-informed generative models, we simulate decision-making processes in
a simulated game-play environment, mirroring experimental setups that use
biological neurons. Our results demonstrate learning in these agents, providing
insights into the role of memory-based learning and predictive planning in
intelligent decision-making. This work contributes to the growing field of
explainable AI by offering a biologically grounded and scalable approach to
understanding purposeful behaviour in agents.

Motivation: 研究动机在于解决IHS框架中整数规划优化器可能因数值不稳定导致的正确性问题，并探索替代方法以提升效率和可靠性。

Method: 方法包括使用伪布尔推理和随机局部搜索作为替代优化技术，并与商业整数规划求解器进行比较。

Result: 结果显示，尽管商业整数规划求解器效率最高，但伪布尔推理在数值稳定性上表现更优，且能提供正确性证明。

Conclusion: 结论指出，伪布尔推理在IHS框架中具有竞争力，尤其在需要数值稳定性和正确性证明的场景中。

Abstract: The implicit hitting set (IHS) approach offers a general framework for
solving computationally hard combinatorial optimization problems declaratively.
IHS iterates between a decision oracle used for extracting sources of
inconsistency and an optimizer for computing so-called hitting sets (HSs) over
the accumulated sources of inconsistency. While the decision oracle is
language-specific, the optimizers is usually instantiated through integer
programming.
  We explore alternative algorithmic techniques for hitting set optimization
based on different ways of employing pseudo-Boolean (PB) reasoning as well as
stochastic local search. We extensively evaluate the practical feasibility of
the alternatives in particular in the context of pseudo-Boolean (0-1 IP)
optimization as one of the most recent instantiations of IHS. Highlighting a
trade-off between efficiency and reliability, while a commercial IP solver
turns out to remain the most effective way to instantiate HS computations, it
can cause correctness issues due to numerical instability; in fact, we show
that exact HS computations instantiated via PB reasoning can be made
competitive with a numerically exact IP solver. Furthermore, the use of PB
reasoning as a basis for HS computations allows for obtaining certificates for
the correctness of IHS computations, generally applicable to any IHS
instantiation in which reasoning in the declarative language at hand can be
captured in the PB-based proof format we employ.

Motivation: 现代生物信息学分析的复杂性导致数据生成与科学洞察之间存在巨大差距，现有语言模型在真实分析流程中表现有限。

Method: 采用分层多智能体系统，通过双循环架构将复杂目标分解为可执行、可验证的任务，并在安全计算环境中执行。

Result: 在BixBench基准测试中，K-Dense Analyst的准确率达到29.2%，比最佳语言模型（GPT-5）高6.3个百分点，性能提升近27%。

Conclusion: 自主科学推理需要专门构建的系统，而不仅仅是增强的语言模型，K-Dense Analyst为生命科学领域的发现提供了重要进展。

Abstract: The complexity of modern bioinformatics analysis has created a critical gap
between data generation and developing scientific insights. While large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise in scientific reasoning, they remain
fundamentally limited when dealing with real-world analytical workflows that
demand iterative computation, tool integration and rigorous validation. We
introduce K-Dense Analyst, a hierarchical multi-agent system that achieves
autonomous bioinformatics analysis through a dual-loop architecture. K-Dense
Analyst, part of the broader K-Dense platform, couples planning with validated
execution using specialized agents to decompose complex objectives into
executable, verifiable tasks within secure computational environments. On
BixBench, a comprehensive benchmark for open-ended biological analysis, K-Dense
Analyst achieves 29.2% accuracy, surpassing the best-performing language model
(GPT-5) by 6.3 percentage points, representing nearly 27% improvement over what
is widely considered the most powerful LLM available. Remarkably, K-Dense
Analyst achieves this performance using Gemini 2.5 Pro, which attains only
18.3% accuracy when used directly, demonstrating that our architectural
innovations unlock capabilities far beyond the underlying model's baseline
performance. Our insights demonstrate that autonomous scientific reasoning
requires more than enhanced language models, it demands purpose-built systems
that can bridge the gap between high-level scientific objectives and low-level
computational execution. These results represent a significant advance toward
fully autonomous computational biologists capable of accelerating discovery
across the life sciences.

Conclusion: 研究强调了在LLM审核中纳入更多异质性和代表性数据以及人类参与的必要性，以提高模型的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: As AI systems become more integrated into daily life, the need for safer and
more reliable moderation has never been greater. Large Language Models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, surpassing earlier models in
complexity and performance. Their evaluation across diverse tasks has
consistently showcased their potential, enabling the development of adaptive
and personalized agents. However, despite these advancements, LLMs remain prone
to errors, particularly in areas requiring nuanced moral reasoning. They
struggle with detecting implicit hate, offensive language, and gender biases
due to the subjective and context-dependent nature of these issues. Moreover,
their reliance on training data can inadvertently reinforce societal biases,
leading to inconsistencies and ethical concerns in their outputs. To explore
the limitations of LLMs in this role, we developed an experimental framework
based on state-of-the-art (SOTA) models to assess human emotions and offensive
behaviors. The framework introduces a unified benchmark dataset encompassing 49
distinct categories spanning the wide spectrum of human emotions, offensive and
hateful text, and gender and racial biases. Furthermore, we introduced SafePhi,
a QLoRA fine-tuned version of Phi-4, adapting diverse ethical contexts and
outperforming benchmark moderators by achieving a Macro F1 score of 0.89, where
OpenAI Moderator and Llama Guard score 0.77 and 0.74, respectively. This
research also highlights the critical domains where LLM moderators consistently
underperformed, pressing the need to incorporate more heterogeneous and
representative data with human-in-the-loop, for better model robustness and
explainability.

Conclusion: 该系统将静态预测转化为自优化系统，推动教育分析向人本、数据驱动和响应式AI发展。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of student performance is essential for timely academic
intervention. However, most machine learning models in education are static and
cannot adapt when new data, such as post-intervention outcomes, become
available. To address this limitation, we propose a Feedback-Driven Decision
Support System (DSS) with a closed-loop architecture that enables continuous
model refinement. The system integrates a LightGBM-based regressor with
incremental retraining, allowing educators to input updated student results,
which automatically trigger model updates. This adaptive mechanism improves
prediction accuracy by learning from real-world academic progress. The platform
features a Flask-based web interface for real-time interaction and incorporates
SHAP for explainability, ensuring transparency. Experimental results show a
10.7\% reduction in RMSE after retraining, with consistent upward adjustments
in predicted scores for intervened students. By transforming static predictors
into self-improving systems, our approach advances educational analytics toward
human-centered, data-driven, and responsive AI. The framework is designed for
integration into LMS and institutional dashboards.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for summarizing structured enterprise data
across multiple dimensions using large language model (LLM)-based agents.
Traditional table-to-text models often lack the capacity to reason across
hierarchical structures and context-aware deltas, which are essential in
business reporting tasks. Our method introduces a multi-agent pipeline that
extracts, analyzes, and summarizes multi-dimensional data using agents for
slicing, variance detection, context construction, and LLM-based generation.
Our results show that the proposed framework outperforms traditional
approaches, achieving 83\% faithfulness to underlying data, superior coverage
of significant changes, and high relevance scores (4.4/5) for decision-critical
insights. The improvements are especially pronounced in categories involving
subtle trade-offs, such as increased revenue due to price changes amid
declining unit volumes, which competing methods either overlook or address with
limited specificity. We evaluate the framework on Kaggle datasets and
demonstrate significant improvements in faithfulness, relevance, and insight
quality over baseline table summarization approaches.

Abstract: Developing general artificial intelligence (AI) systems to support endoscopic

large-scale pretraining often lack unified coordination across tasks and
struggle to handle the multi-step processes required in complex clinical

memory-guided agent for vision-to-decision endoscopic analysis that integrates
iterative reasoning with adaptive tool selection and collaboration. Built on a
dual-memory design, it enables sophisticated decision-making by ensuring
logical coherence through short-term action tracking and progressively
enhancing reasoning acuity through long-term experiential learning. To support
diverse clinical tasks, EndoAgent integrates a suite of expert-designed tools
within a unified reasoning loop. We further introduce EndoAgentBench, a
benchmark of 5,709 visual question-answer pairs that assess visual
understanding and language generation capabilities in realistic scenarios.
Extensive experiments show that EndoAgent consistently outperforms both general

Conclusion: Comp-Comp框架不仅适用于学术领域，还可扩展至其他领域，为基准构建提供新思路。

Abstract: Numerous benchmarks have been built to evaluate the domain-specific abilities
of large language models (LLMs), highlighting the need for effective and
efficient benchmark construction. Existing domain-specific benchmarks primarily
focus on the scaling law, relying on massive corpora for supervised fine-tuning
or generating extensive question sets for broad coverage. However, the impact
of corpus and question-answer (QA) set design on the precision and recall of
domain-specific LLMs remains unexplored. In this paper, we address this gap and
demonstrate that the scaling law is not always the optimal principle for
benchmark construction in specific domains. Instead, we propose Comp-Comp, an
iterative benchmarking framework based on a comprehensiveness-compactness
principle. Here, comprehensiveness ensures semantic recall of the domain, while
compactness enhances precision, guiding both corpus and QA set construction. To
validate our framework, we conducted a case study in a well-renowned
university, resulting in the creation of XUBench, a large-scale and
comprehensive closed-domain benchmark. Although we use the academic domain as
the case in this work, our Comp-Comp framework is designed to be extensible
beyond academia, providing valuable insights for benchmark construction across
various domains.

Result: 在AutoPenBench上成功率为24.2%，Cybench上为15.0%，性能接近顶级专有模型。

Conclusion: 两阶段训练协同作用对成功至关重要，Pentest-R1为开源LLM设定了新标杆。

Abstract: Automating penetration testing is crucial for enhancing cybersecurity, yet
current Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant limitations in this
domain, including poor error handling, inefficient reasoning, and an inability
to perform complex end-to-end tasks autonomously. To address these challenges,
we introduce Pentest-R1, a novel framework designed to optimize LLM reasoning
capabilities for this task through a two-stage reinforcement learning pipeline.
We first construct a dataset of over 500 real-world, multi-step walkthroughs,
which Pentest-R1 leverages for offline reinforcement learning (RL) to instill
foundational attack logic. Subsequently, the LLM is fine-tuned via online RL in
an interactive Capture The Flag (CTF) environment, where it learns directly
from environmental feedback to develop robust error self-correction and
adaptive strategies. Our extensive experiments on the Cybench and AutoPenBench
benchmarks demonstrate the framework's effectiveness. On AutoPenBench,
Pentest-R1 achieves a 24.2\% success rate, surpassing most state-of-the-art
models and ranking second only to Gemini 2.5 Flash. On Cybench, it attains a
15.0\% success rate in unguided tasks, establishing a new state-of-the-art for
open-source LLMs and matching the performance of top proprietary models.
Ablation studies confirm that the synergy of both training stages is critical
to its success.

TL;DR: 提出Invert4TVG框架，通过三个反转任务增强视频片段定位和动作理解，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过度优化时间IoU，牺牲语义动作理解，影响TVG的鲁棒性。

Method: 引入三个反转任务：动词补全、动作识别和视频描述，结合强化学习框架优化定位和语义。

Result: 在Charades-STA上R1@0.7提升7.1%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过反转任务增强语义理解，显著提升定位精度。

Abstract: Temporal Video Grounding (TVG) seeks to localize video segments matching a
given textual query. Current methods, while optimizing for high temporal
Intersection-over-Union (IoU), often overfit to this metric, compromising
semantic action understanding in the video and query, a critical factor for
robust TVG. To address this, we introduce Inversion Tasks for TVG (Invert4TVG),
a novel framework that enhances both localization accuracy and action
understanding without additional data. Our approach leverages three inversion
tasks derived from existing TVG annotations: (1) Verb Completion, predicting
masked action verbs in queries from video segments; (2) Action Recognition,
identifying query-described actions; and (3) Video Description, generating
descriptions of video segments that explicitly embed query-relevant actions.
These tasks, integrated with TVG via a reinforcement learning framework with
well-designed reward functions, ensure balanced optimization of localization
and semantics. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving a 7.1\% improvement in R1@0.7 on Charades-STA for a 3B
model compared to Time-R1. By inverting TVG to derive query-related actions
from segments, our approach strengthens semantic understanding, significantly
raising the ceiling of localization accuracy.

Motivation: 随着生成式人工智能（GAI）和大型语言模型（LLMs）的突破，越来越多的专业服务通过AI增强，本文旨在探索GAI在政府战略计划制定中的应用。

Method: 使用BERTopic和NMF模型对政府问责办公室（GAO）的大量报告进行主题建模，生成的主题与战略计划中的愿景元素进行相似性评分比较。

Result: BERTopic和NMF均能生成与愿景元素100%相似的主题，其中BERTopic表现更优，超过一半的主题达到“中等”或“强”相关性。

Conclusion: GAI在战略计划制定中具有巨大潜力，未来工作将聚焦于模型的实际应用和其他模块的可行性验证。

Abstract: Given recent breakthroughs in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) and
Large Language Models (LLMs), more and more professional services are being
augmented through Artificial Intelligence (AI), which once seemed impossible to
automate. This paper presents a modular model for leveraging GAI in developing
strategic plans for large scale government organizations and evaluates leading
machine learning techniques in their application towards one of the identified
modules. Specifically, the performance of BERTopic and Non-negative Matrix
Factorization (NMF) are evaluated in their ability to use topic modeling to
generate themes representative of Vision Elements within a strategic plan. To
accomplish this, BERTopic and NMF models are trained using a large volume of
reports from the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The generated topics
from each model are then scored for similarity against the Vision Elements of a
published strategic plan and the results are compared. Our results show that
these techniques are capable of generating themes similar to 100% of the
elements being evaluated against. Further, we conclude that BERTopic performs
best in this application with more than half of its correlated topics achieving
a "medium" or "strong" correlation. A capability of GAI-enabled strategic plan
development impacts a multi-billion dollar industry and assists the federal
government in overcoming regulatory requirements which are crucial to the
public good. Further work will focus on the operationalization of the concept
proven in this study as well as viability of the remaining modules in the
proposed model for GAI-generated strategic plans.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have sparked growing interest in AI
agents capable of solving complex, real-world tasks. However, most existing
agent systems rely on manually crafted configurations that remain static after
deployment, limiting their ability to adapt to dynamic and evolving
environments. To this end, recent research has explored agent evolution
techniques that aim to automatically enhance agent systems based on interaction
data and environmental feedback. This emerging direction lays the foundation
for self-evolving AI agents, which bridge the static capabilities of foundation
models with the continuous adaptability required by lifelong agentic systems.
In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques for
self-evolving agentic systems. Specifically, we first introduce a unified
conceptual framework that abstracts the feedback loop underlying the design of
self-evolving agentic systems. The framework highlights four key components:
System Inputs, Agent System, Environment, and Optimisers, serving as a
foundation for understanding and comparing different strategies. Based on this
framework, we systematically review a wide range of self-evolving techniques
that target different components of the agent system. We also investigate
domain-specific evolution strategies developed for specialised fields such as
biomedicine, programming, and finance, where optimisation objectives are
tightly coupled with domain constraints. In addition, we provide a dedicated
discussion on the evaluation, safety, and ethical considerations for
self-evolving agentic systems, which are critical to ensuring their
effectiveness and reliability. This survey aims to provide researchers and
practitioners with a systematic understanding of self-evolving AI agents,
laying the foundation for the development of more adaptive, autonomous, and
lifelong agentic systems.

Abstract: Language is a ubiquitous tool that is foundational to reasoning and
collaboration, ranging from everyday interactions to sophisticated
problem-solving tasks. The establishment of a common language can serve as a
powerful asset in ensuring clear communication and understanding amongst
agents, facilitating desired coordination and strategies. In this work, we
extend the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by integrating them
with advancements in multi-agent decision-making algorithms. We propose a
systematic framework for the design of multi-agentic large language models
(LLMs), focusing on key integration practices. These include advanced prompt
engineering techniques, the development of effective memory architectures,
multi-modal information processing, and alignment strategies through
fine-tuning algorithms. We evaluate these design choices through extensive
ablation studies on classic game settings with significant underlying social
dilemmas and game-theoretic considerations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 《外交》游戏状态复杂且信息密集，加上比赛的高变异性，使其难以研究。本研究旨在通过优化文本游戏状态表示，使普通LLM也能可靠完成比赛。

Method: 采用数据驱动的迭代方法优化游戏状态表示，开发工具支持假设测试和统计分析，并引入关键状态分析协议。

Conclusion: 该工具消除了微调需求，为LLM的战略推理能力评估提供了民主化途径，并揭示了这些能力如何自然地从广泛使用的LLM中涌现。

Abstract: We present the first evaluation harness that enables any out-of-the-box,
local, Large Language Models (LLMs) to play full-press Diplomacy without
fine-tuning or specialized training. Previous work required frontier LLMs, or
fine-tuning, due to the high complexity and information density of Diplomacy's
game state. Combined with the high variance of matches, these factors made
Diplomacy prohibitive for study. In this work, we used data-driven iteration to
optimize a textual game state representation such that a 24B model can reliably
complete matches without any fine tuning. We develop tooling to facilitate
hypothesis testing and statistical analysis, and we present case studies on
persuasion, aggressive playstyles, and performance across a range of models. We
conduct a variety of experiments across many popular LLMs, finding the larger
models perform the best, but the smaller models still play adequately. We also
introduce Critical State Analysis: an experimental protocol for rapidly
iterating and analyzing key moments in a game at depth. Our harness
democratizes the evaluation of strategic reasoning in LLMs by eliminating the
need for fine-tuning, and it provides insights into how these capabilities
emerge naturally from widely used LLMs. Our code is available in the supplement
and will be open sourced.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估LLMs和AI Agents使用MCP工具的能力存在数据集不足、响应格式多样、成功率不稳定以及上下文窗口限制等问题。

Method: 构建MCPToolBench++基准测试，涵盖40多个类别的4k多个MCP服务器，包含单步和多步工具调用数据集。

Result: 评估了具有代理能力的SOTA LLMs，并报告了结果。

Conclusion: MCPToolBench++为评估LLMs在MCP工具调用上的性能提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: LLMs' capabilities are enhanced by using function calls to integrate various
data sources or API results into the context window. Typical tools include
search, web crawlers, maps, financial data, file systems, and browser usage,
etc. Integrating these data sources or functions requires a standardized
method. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way to supply
context to LLMs. However, the evaluation of LLMs and AI Agents' MCP tool use
abilities suffer from several issues. First, there's a lack of comprehensive
datasets or benchmarks to evaluate various MCP tools. Second, the diverse
formats of response from MCP tool call execution further increase the
difficulty of evaluation. Additionally, unlike existing tool-use benchmarks
with high success rates in functions like programming and math functions, the
success rate of real-world MCP tool is not guaranteed and varies across
different MCP servers. Furthermore, the LLMs' context window also limits the
number of available tools that can be called in a single run, because the
textual descriptions of tool and the parameters have long token length for an
LLM to process all at once. To help address the challenges of evaluating LLMs'
performance on calling MCP tools, we propose MCPToolBench++, a large-scale,
multi-domain AI Agent tool use benchmark. As of July 2025, this benchmark is
build upon marketplace of over 4k MCP servers from more than 40 categories,
collected from the MCP marketplaces and GitHub communities. The datasets
consist of both single-step and multi-step tool calls across different
categories. We evaluated SOTA LLMs with agentic abilities on this benchmark and
reported the results.

Conclusion: 提出的算法能有效提升隐蔽语义通信的安全性和性能。

Abstract: In this paper, a novel covert semantic communication framework is
investigated. Within this framework, a server extracts and transmits the
semantic information, i.e., the meaning of image data, to a user over several
time slots. An attacker seeks to detect and eavesdrop the semantic transmission
to acquire details of the original image. To avoid data meaning being
eavesdropped by an attacker, a friendly jammer is deployed to transmit jamming
signals to interfere the attacker so as to hide the transmitted semantic
information. Meanwhile, the server will strategically select time slots for
semantic information transmission. Due to limited energy, the jammer will not
communicate with the server and hence the server does not know the transmit
power of the jammer. Therefore, the server must jointly optimize the semantic
information transmitted at each time slot and the corresponding transmit power
to maximize the privacy and the semantic information transmission quality of
the user. To solve this problem, we propose a prioritised sampling assisted
twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to jointly determine
the transmitted semantic information and the transmit power per time slot
without the communications between the server and the jammer. Compared to
standard reinforcement learning methods, the propose method uses an additional
Q network to estimate Q values such that the agent can select the action with a
lower Q value from the two Q networks thus avoiding local optimal action
selection and estimation bias of Q values. Simulation results show that the
proposed algorithm can improve the privacy and the semantic information
transmission quality by up to 77.8% and 14.3% compared to the traditional
reinforcement learning methods.

Motivation: 解决LLM在大规模工具库中选择工具时因上下文限制和噪声导致的低准确性和高计算成本问题。

Method: 使用HGMF框架，分两阶段进行高斯混合模型聚类和基于查询似然的过滤，生成高相关性候选集。

Result: 实验表明HGMF显著提高工具选择准确性并降低推理延迟。

Conclusion: HGMF是一种可扩展且有效的方法，适用于大规模工具库。

Abstract: Invoking external tools enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform
complex, real-world tasks, yet selecting the correct tool from large,
hierarchically-structured libraries remains a significant challenge. The
limited context windows of LLMs and noise from irrelevant options often lead to
low selection accuracy and high computational costs. To address this, we
propose the Hierarchical Gaussian Mixture Framework (HGMF), a probabilistic
pruning method for scalable tool invocation. HGMF first maps the user query and
all tool descriptions into a unified semantic space. The framework then
operates in two stages: it clusters servers using a Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM) and filters them based on the query's likelihood. Subsequently, it
applies the same GMM-based clustering and filtering to the tools associated
with the selected servers. This hierarchical process produces a compact,
high-relevance candidate set, simplifying the final selection task for the LLM.
Experiments on a public dataset show that HGMF significantly improves tool
selection accuracy while reducing inference latency, confirming the framework's
scalability and effectiveness for large-scale tool libraries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL方法仅能激发模型已有的推理行为，无法真正培养新能力，因此需要一种方法训练不具备此类行为的模型。

Method: 采用GRPO框架，通过教师模型提供反馈指导，模拟课堂中的问题-尝试-反馈-解决方案流程。

Result: 在MATH-500、AIME和GPQA-Diamond等任务上分别提升2.08%、2.23%和3.99%，平均提升3.85%。

Conclusion: ThinkTuning通过教师模型的反馈指导，有效提升了学生模型的推理能力，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in test-time scaling have led to the emergence of thinking
LLMs that exhibit self-reflective behaviors and multi-step reasoning. While RL
drives this self-improvement paradigm, a recent study (Gandhi et al., 2025)
shows that RL alone does not truly instill these new reasoning abilities - it
merely draws out behaviors already present in the base models. This raises a
question: How can we train the models that don't exhibit such thinking behavior
to develop it in the first place? To this end, we propose ThinkTuning, a
GRPO-based interactive training approach where we augment the rollouts of a
student model with the guidance from a teacher model. A simple idea from
classroom practice inspires our method: a teacher poses a problem, lets the
student try an answer, then gives corrective feedback -- enough to point the
mind in the right direction and then show the solution. Each piece of feedback
reshapes the student's thoughts, leading them to arrive at the correct
solution. Similarly, we find that this type of implicit supervision through
feedback from a teacher model of the same size improves the reasoning
capabilities of the student model. In particular, on average, our method shows
a 3.85% improvement over zero-shot baselines across benchmarks, and on
MATH-500, AIME and GPQA-Diamond it shows 2.08%, 2.23% and 3.99% improvements
over the vanilla-GRPO baseline. Source code is available at

Abstract: The future of poultry production depends on a paradigm shift replacing
subjective, labor-intensive welfare checks with data-driven, intelligent
monitoring ecosystems. Traditional welfare assessments-limited by human
observation and single-sensor data-cannot fully capture the complex,
multidimensional nature of laying hen welfare in modern farms. Multimodal
Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a breakthrough, integrating visual,
acoustic, environmental, and physiological data streams to reveal deeper
insights into avian welfare dynamics. This investigation highlights multimodal
As transformative potential, showing that intermediate (feature-level) fusion
strategies achieve the best balance between robustness and performance under
real-world poultry conditions, and offer greater scalability than early or late
fusion approaches. Key adoption barriers include sensor fragility in harsh farm
environments, high deployment costs, inconsistent behavioral definitions, and
limited cross-farm generalizability. To address these, we introduce two novel
evaluation tools - the Domain Transfer Score (DTS) to measure model
adaptability across diverse farm settings, and the Data Reliability Index (DRI)
to assess sensor data quality under operational constraints. We also propose a
modular, context-aware deployment framework designed for laying hen
environments, enabling scalable and practical integration of multimodal
sensing. This work lays the foundation for a transition from reactive, unimodal
monitoring to proactive, precision-driven welfare systems that unite
productivity with ethical, science based animal care.

Conclusion: SkillNav通过模块化和技能分解显著提升了VLN任务的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) poses significant challenges in enabling
agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate complex 3D
environments. While recent progress has been driven by large-scale pre-training
and data augmentation, current methods still struggle to generalize to unseen
scenarios, particularly when complex spatial and temporal reasoning is
required. In this work, we propose SkillNav, a modular framework that
introduces structured, skill-based reasoning into Transformer-based VLN agents.
Our method decomposes navigation into a set of interpretable atomic skills
(e.g., Vertical Movement, Area and Region Identification, Stop and Pause), each
handled by a specialized agent. We then introduce a novel zero-shot
Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based router, which dynamically selects the most
suitable agent at each time step by aligning sub-goals with visual observations
and historical actions. SkillNav achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on
the R2R benchmark and demonstrates strong generalization to the GSA-R2R
benchmark that includes novel instruction styles and unseen environments.

Motivation: 现有POI推荐模型将时空转换分开建模，导致冗余信息，降低模型效果和可解释性。

Method: 提出DiMuST模型，使用解耦变分多图自编码器（DAE）分离共享和私有分布，通过PoE机制融合共享特征，对比约束去噪私有特征。

Result: 在两个数据集上，DiMuST在多项指标上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DiMuST有效捕捉POI的时空转换表示，同时保持其时空关系的固有相关性。

Abstract: Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is a research hotspot in business
intelligence, where users' spatial-temporal transitions and social
relationships play key roles. However, most existing works model spatial and
temporal transitions separately, leading to misaligned representations of the
same spatial-temporal key nodes. This misalignment introduces redundant
information during fusion, increasing model uncertainty and reducing
interpretability. To address this issue, we propose DiMuST, a socially enhanced
POI recommendation model based on disentangled representation learning over
multiplex spatial-temporal transition graphs. The model employs a novel
Disentangled variational multiplex graph Auto-Encoder (DAE), which first
disentangles shared and private distributions using a multiplex
spatial-temporal graph strategy. It then fuses the shared features via a
Product of Experts (PoE) mechanism and denoises the private features through
contrastive constraints. The model effectively captures the spatial-temporal
transition representations of POIs while preserving the intrinsic correlation
of their spatial-temporal relationships. Experiments on two challenging
datasets demonstrate that our DiMuST significantly outperforms existing methods
across multiple metrics.

Conclusion: 多智能体系统的信息流设计在上下文隐私保护中具有潜力。

Abstract: Addressing contextual privacy concerns remains challenging in interactive
settings where large language models (LLMs) process information from multiple
sources (e.g., summarizing meetings with private and public information). We
introduce a multi-agent framework that decomposes privacy reasoning into
specialized subtasks (extraction, classification), reducing the information
load on any single agent while enabling iterative validation and more reliable
adherence to contextual privacy norms. To understand how privacy errors emerge
and propagate, we conduct a systematic ablation over information-flow
topologies, revealing when and why upstream detection mistakes cascade into
downstream leakage. Experiments on the ConfAIde and PrivacyLens benchmark with
several open-source and closed-sourced LLMs demonstrate that our best
multi-agent configuration substantially reduces private information leakage
(\textbf{18\%} on ConfAIde and \textbf{19\%} on PrivacyLens with GPT-4o) while
preserving the fidelity of public content, outperforming single-agent
baselines. These results highlight the promise of principled information-flow
design in multi-agent systems for contextual privacy with LLMs.

Conclusion: EMPATHIA通过增强而非替代人类专业知识，为多价值协调的AI驱动任务提供了通用框架。

Abstract: Current AI approaches to refugee integration optimize narrow objectives such
as employment and fail to capture the cultural, emotional, and ethical
dimensions critical for long-term success. We introduce EMPATHIA (Enriched
Multimodal Pathways for Agentic Thinking in Humanitarian Immigrant Assistance),
a multi-agent framework addressing the central Creative AI question: how do we
preserve human dignity when machines participate in life-altering decisions?
Grounded in Kegan's Constructive Developmental Theory, EMPATHIA decomposes
integration into three modules: SEED (Socio-cultural Entry and Embedding
Decision) for initial placement, RISE (Rapid Integration and Self-sufficiency
Engine) for early independence, and THRIVE (Transcultural Harmony and
Resilience through Integrated Values and Engagement) for sustained outcomes.
SEED employs a selector-validator architecture with three specialized agents -
emotional, cultural, and ethical - that deliberate transparently to produce
interpretable recommendations. Experiments on the UN Kakuma dataset (15,026
individuals, 7,960 eligible adults 15+ per ILO/UNHCR standards) and
implementation on 6,359 working-age refugees (15+) with 150+ socioeconomic
variables achieved 87.4% validation convergence and explainable assessments
across five host countries. EMPATHIA's weighted integration of cultural,

### [376] [Ethics2vec: aligning automatic agents and human preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07673)
*Gianluca Bontempi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Ethics2Vec的方法，通过向量化自动代理的决策策略，评估其与人类价值观的一致性，解决了AI系统与人类价值观对齐的难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统的行为中嵌入的伦理价值观难以从人类角度理解，尤其是在涉及不可比较的价值观时（如生命价值与治疗成本）。需要一种方法将这些价值观量化并比较。

Method: 扩展Anything2vec方法，将自动代理的决策策略映射为多元向量表示，用于评估与人类价值观的对齐。以二元决策和自动驾驶为例说明其应用。

Result: 提出Ethics2Vec方法，成功将伦理价值观向量化，并展示了其在二元决策和自动控制场景中的可行性。

Conclusion: Ethics2Vec为AI系统与人类价值观对齐提供了一种量化工具，未来可扩展至更复杂的伦理决策场景。

Abstract: Though intelligent agents are supposed to improve human experience (or make
it more efficient), it is hard from a human perspective to grasp the ethical
values which are explicitly or implicitly embedded in an agent behaviour. This
is the well-known problem of alignment, which refers to the challenge of
designing AI systems that align with human values, goals and preferences. This
problem is particularly challenging since most human ethical considerations
refer to \emph{incommensurable} (i.e. non-measurable and/or incomparable)
values and criteria. Consider, for instance, a medical agent prescribing a
treatment to a cancerous patient. How could it take into account (and/or weigh)
incommensurable aspects like the value of a human life and the cost of the
treatment? Now, the alignment between human and artificial values is possible
only if we define a common space where a metric can be defined and used. This
paper proposes to extend to ethics the conventional Anything2vec approach,
which has been successful in plenty of similar and hard-to-quantify domains
(ranging from natural language processing to recommendation systems and graph
analysis). This paper proposes a way to map an automatic agent decision-making
(or control law) strategy to a multivariate vector representation, which can be
used to compare and assess the alignment with human values. The Ethics2Vec
method is first introduced in the case of an automatic agent performing binary
decision-making. Then, a vectorisation of an automatic control law (like in the
case of a self-driving car) is discussed to show how the approach can be
extended to automatic control settings.

*Markus Fritzsche,Elliot Gestrin,Jendrik Seipp*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种对比学习目标，使Transformer能够感知对称性，从而解决其在自动规划任务中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在自动规划领域的应用受限，主要由于其对问题对称性的处理不足，导致难以从简单问题推广到复杂问题。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的对比学习目标，结合架构改进，使Transformer能够高效学习对称性。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个规划领域中有效解决了PlanGPT的局限性。

Conclusion: 对称性感知训练显著提升了Transformer在自动规划任务中的性能。

Abstract: While transformers excel in many settings, their application in the field of
automated planning is limited. Prior work like PlanGPT, a state-of-the-art
decoder-only transformer, struggles with extrapolation from easy to hard
planning problems. This in turn stems from problem symmetries: planning tasks
can be represented with arbitrary variable names that carry no meaning beyond
being identifiers. This causes a combinatorial explosion of equivalent
representations that pure transformers cannot efficiently learn from. We
propose a novel contrastive learning objective to make transformers
symmetry-aware and thereby compensate for their lack of inductive bias.
Combining this with architectural improvements, we show that transformers can
be efficiently trained for either plan-generation or heuristic-prediction. Our
results across multiple planning domains demonstrate that our symmetry-aware
training effectively and efficiently addresses the limitations of PlanGPT.

### [378] [Best-Effort Policies for Robust Markov Decision Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07790)
*Alessandro Abate,Thom Badings,Giuseppe De Giacomo,Francesco Fabiano*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了鲁棒马尔可夫决策过程（RMDPs）的推广，提出了一种新的策略选择标准——最优鲁棒最佳努力（ORBE）策略，以解决在非完全对抗性转移概率下的策略选择问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在RMDPs中，虽然可以通过鲁棒值迭代高效计算最优鲁棒策略，但这些策略在非对抗性转移概率下的表现可能不同。因此，需要一种更精细的策略选择标准。

Method: 提出ORBE策略，结合了博弈论中的支配和最佳努力概念，要求策略不仅在对抗性情况下表现最优，还能在非对抗性情况下实现最大期望回报。

Result: 证明了ORBE策略的存在性，描述了其结构，并提出了一种计算算法，其开销仅略高于标准鲁棒值迭代。数值实验验证了方法的可行性。

Conclusion: ORBE策略为RMDPs中的策略选择提供了更精细的标准，能够作为最优鲁棒策略的合理打破平局方法。

Abstract: We study the common generalization of Markov decision processes (MDPs) with
sets of transition probabilities, known as robust MDPs (RMDPs). A standard goal
in RMDPs is to compute a policy that maximizes the expected return under an
adversarial choice of the transition probabilities. If the uncertainty in the
probabilities is independent between the states, known as s-rectangularity,
such optimal robust policies can be computed efficiently using robust value
iteration. However, there might still be multiple optimal robust policies,
which, while equivalent with respect to the worst-case, reflect different
expected returns under non-adversarial choices of the transition probabilities.
Hence, we propose a refined policy selection criterion for RMDPs, drawing
inspiration from the notions of dominance and best-effort in game theory.
Instead of seeking a policy that only maximizes the worst-case expected return,
we additionally require the policy to achieve a maximal expected return under
different (i.e., not fully adversarial) transition probabilities. We call such
a policy an optimal robust best-effort (ORBE) policy. We prove that ORBE
policies always exist, characterize their structure, and present an algorithm
to compute them with a small overhead compared to standard robust value
iteration. ORBE policies offer a principled tie-breaker among optimal robust
policies. Numerical experiments show the feasibility of our approach.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于知识图谱的人工智能系统，为急救人员提供实时治疗建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球救援需求增加，急救人员需在短时间内提供个性化医疗，但缺乏实时知识支持。

Method: 采用知识图谱作为核心知识表示，结合人工智能预识别情境。

Result: 系统能为急救人员提供智能治疗推荐。

Conclusion: 知识图谱和AI技术可显著提升急救效率和效果。

Abstract: Over the years, the need for rescue operations throughout the world has
increased rapidly. Demographic changes and the resulting risk of injury or
health disorders form the basis for emergency calls. In such scenarios, first
responders are in a rush to reach the patient in need, provide first aid, and
save lives. In these situations, they must be able to provide personalized and
optimized healthcare in the shortest possible time and estimate the patients
condition with the help of freshly recorded vital data in an emergency
situation. However, in such a timedependent situation, first responders and
medical experts cannot fully grasp their knowledge and need assistance and
recommendation for further medical treatments. To achieve this, on the spot
calculated, evaluated, and processed knowledge must be made available to
improve treatments by first responders. The Knowledge Graph presented in this
article as a central knowledge representation provides first responders with an
innovative knowledge management that enables intelligent treatment
recommendations with an artificial intelligence-based pre-recognition of the
situation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为X-evolve的新方法，通过演化解空间而非单个解，显著减少LLM调用成本，并在多个优化问题上取得突破性成果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前结合LLM和EA的方法通常演化单个解，导致LLM调用成本高。X-evolve旨在通过演化解空间来提高搜索效率。

Method: X-evolve通过LLM生成可调程序，定义可调解空间，并利用基于分数的搜索算法高效探索。

Result: 在多个优化问题上取得突破：1) 发现更大的部分容许集；2) 提高Shannon容量下界；3) 生成优于标准策略的启发式算法。

Conclusion: X-evolve通过演化解空间显著提高了搜索效率，适用于高维问题。

Abstract: While combining large language models (LLMs) with evolutionary algorithms
(EAs) shows promise for solving complex optimization problems, current
approaches typically evolve individual solutions, often incurring high LLM call
costs. We introduce \(X\)-evolve, a paradigm-shifting method that instead
evolves solution spaces \(X\) (sets of individual solutions) - subsets of the
overall search space \(S\). In \(X\)-evolve, LLMs generate tunable programs
wherein certain code snippets, designated as parameters, define a tunable
solution space. A score-based search algorithm then efficiently explores this
parametrically defined space, guided by feedback from objective function
scores. This strategy enables broader and more efficient exploration, which can
potentially accelerate convergence at a much lower search cost, requiring up to
two orders of magnitude fewer LLM calls than prior leading methods. We
demonstrate \(X\)-evolve's efficacy across three distinct hard optimization
problems. For the cap set problem, we discover a larger partial admissible set,
establishing a new tighter asymptotic lower bound for the cap set constant (\(C
\ge 2.2203\)). In information theory, we uncover a larger independent set for
the 15-vertex cycle graph (\(\mathcal{C}_{15}^{\boxtimes 5}\), size 19,946),
thereby raising the known lower bound on its Shannon capacity. Furthermore, for
the NP-hard online bin packing problem, we generate heuristics that
consistently outperform standard strategies across established benchmarks. By
evolving solution spaces, our method considerably improves search
effectiveness, making it possible to tackle high-dimensional problems that were
previously computationally prohibitive.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种基于LSTM短期预测的碰撞风险预判方法，通过动态调整DQN奖励减少碰撞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无通信或标识的受限环境中，机器人运动易碰撞，需低成本解决方案。

Method: 使用LSTM预测机器人位置，动态调整DQN奖励以预判碰撞风险。

Result: 在1Hz采样频率下，碰撞次数显著减少，稳定性提升。

Conclusion: 该方法计算成本低，适合嵌入式系统。

Abstract: This article proposes a collision risk anticipation method based on
short-term prediction of the agents position. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
model, trained on past trajectories, is used to estimate the next position of
each robot. This prediction allows us to define an anticipated collision risk
by dynamically modulating the reward of a Deep Q-Learning Network (DQN) agent.
The approach is tested in a constrained environment, where two robots move
without communication or identifiers. Despite a limited sampling frequency (1
Hz), the results show a significant decrease of the collisions number and a
stability improvement. The proposed method, which is computationally
inexpensive, appears particularly attractive for implementation on embedded
systems.

Abstract: Forensic cause-of-death determination faces systemic challenges, including
workforce shortages and diagnostic variability, particularly in high-volume
systems like China's medicolegal infrastructure. We introduce FEAT (ForEnsic
AgenT), a multi-agent AI framework that automates and standardizes death
investigations through a domain-adapted large language model. FEAT's
application-oriented architecture integrates: (i) a central Planner for task
decomposition, (ii) specialized Local Solvers for evidence analysis, (iii) a
Memory & Reflection module for iterative refinement, and (iv) a Global Solver
for conclusion synthesis. The system employs tool-augmented reasoning,
hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation, forensic-tuned LLMs, and
human-in-the-loop feedback to ensure legal and medical validity. In evaluations
across diverse Chinese case cohorts, FEAT outperformed state-of-the-art AI
systems in both long-form autopsy analyses and concise cause-of-death
conclusions. It demonstrated robust generalization across six geographic
regions and achieved high expert concordance in blinded validations. Senior
pathologists validated FEAT's outputs as comparable to those of human experts,
with improved detection of subtle evidentiary nuances. To our knowledge, FEAT
is the first LLM-based AI agent system dedicated to forensic medicine, offering
scalable, consistent death certification while maintaining expert-level rigor.
By integrating AI efficiency with human oversight, this work could advance
equitable access to reliable medicolegal services while addressing critical
capacity constraints in forensic systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fedspeak作为美联储的政策信号工具，对市场预期和经济条件有重要影响，自动解析Fedspeak对金融预测和算法交易具有重要意义。

Method: 采用LLM框架，结合货币政策传导机制的领域特定推理，并引入动态不确定性解码模块评估模型预测置信度。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在政策立场分析任务上达到最优性能，且感知不确定性与模型错误率显著正相关。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效提升了Fedspeak解析的准确性和可靠性，验证了感知不确定性作为诊断信号的有效性。

Abstract: "Fedspeak", the stylized and often nuanced language used by the U.S. Federal
Reserve, encodes implicit policy signals and strategic stances. The Federal
Open Market Committee strategically employs Fedspeak as a communication tool to
shape market expectations and influence both domestic and global economic
conditions. As such, automatically parsing and interpreting Fedspeak presents a
high-impact challenge, with significant implications for financial forecasting,
algorithmic trading, and data-driven policy analysis. In this paper, we propose
an LLM-based, uncertainty-aware framework for deciphering Fedspeak and
classifying its underlying monetary policy stance. Technically, to enrich the
semantic and contextual representation of Fedspeak texts, we incorporate
domain-specific reasoning grounded in the monetary policy transmission
mechanism. We further introduce a dynamic uncertainty decoding module to assess
the confidence of model predictions, thereby enhancing both classification
accuracy and model reliability. Experimental results demonstrate that our
framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the policy stance analysis
task. Moreover, statistical analysis reveals a significant positive correlation
between perceptual uncertainty and model error rates, validating the
effectiveness of perceptual uncertainty as a diagnostic signal.

Abstract: We study a fitting problem inspired by ontology-mediated querying: given a
collection
  of positive and negative examples of
  the form $(\mathcal{A},q)$ with
  $\mathcal{A}$ an ABox and $q$ a Boolean query, we seek
  an ontology $\mathcal{O}$ that satisfies $\mathcal{A} \cup \mathcal{O} \vDash
q$ for all positive examples and $\mathcal{A} \cup \mathcal{O}\not\vDash q$ for
all negative examples.
  We consider the description logics $\mathcal{ALC}$ and $\mathcal{ALCI}$ as
ontology languages and
  a range of query languages that
  includes atomic queries (AQs), conjunctive queries (CQs), and unions thereof
(UCQs).
  For all of the resulting fitting problems,
  we provide
  effective characterizations and determine the computational complexity
  of deciding whether a fitting ontology exists. This problem turns out to be
${\small CO}NP$ for AQs and full CQs
  and $2E{\small XP}T{\small IME}$-complete for CQs and UCQs.
  These results hold for both $\mathcal{ALC}$ and $\mathcal{ALCI}$.

Conclusion: AdaptFlow通过语言引导的修改实现了对新任务的有效泛化。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest
in agentic workflows, which are structured sequences of LLM invocations
intended to solve complex tasks. However, existing approaches often rely on
static templates or manually designed workflows, which limit adaptability to
diverse tasks and hinder scalability. We propose AdaptFlow, a natural
language-based meta-learning framework inspired by model-agnostic meta-learning
(MAML). AdaptFlow learns a generalizable workflow initialization that enables
rapid subtask-level adaptation. It employs a bi-level optimization scheme: the
inner loop refines the workflow for a specific subtask using LLM-generated
feedback, while the outer loop updates the shared initialization to perform
well across tasks. This setup allows AdaptFlow to generalize effectively to
unseen tasks by adapting the initialized workflow through language-guided
modifications. Evaluated across question answering, code generation, and
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, AdaptFlow consistently outperforms both
manually crafted and automatically searched baselines, achieving
state-of-the-art results with strong generalization across tasks and models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中，数据或模型常来自不同区域或组织，导致异构框架问题，传统融合方法效果不佳。

Method: 提出FNBT方法，通过扩展框架和全否定机制，使现有组合规则适用于异构框架下的信息融合。

Result: 理论证明FNBT满足质量函数不变性、遗传性和本质冲突消除；实验验证其在分类任务中的优越性。

Conclusion: FNBT有效解决了异构框架下的信息融合问题，具有理论和实践价值。

Abstract: The Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence has been widely applied in the field
of information fusion under uncertainty. Most existing research focuses on
combining evidence within the same frame of discernment. However, in real-world
scenarios, trained algorithms or data often originate from different regions or
organizations, where data silos are prevalent. As a result, using different
data sources or models to generate basic probability assignments may lead to
heterogeneous frames, for which traditional fusion methods often yield
unsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, this study proposes an
open-world information fusion method, termed Full Negation Belief
Transformation (FNBT), based on the Dempster-Shafer theory. More specially, a
criterion is introduced to determine whether a given fusion task belongs to the
open-world setting. Then, by extending the frames, the method can accommodate
elements from heterogeneous frames. Finally, a full negation mechanism is
employed to transform the mass functions, so that existing combination rules
can be applied to the transformed mass functions for such information fusion.
Theoretically, the proposed method satisfies three desirable properties, which
are formally proven: mass function invariance, heritability, and essential
conflict elimination. Empirically, FNBT demonstrates superior performance in
pattern classification tasks on real-world datasets and successfully resolves
Zadeh's counterexample, thereby validating its practical effectiveness.

Conclusion: TeamMedAgents为关键决策领域的多智能体系统设计提供了基于证据的方法，推动了协作AI的发展。

Abstract: We present TeamMedAgents, a novel multi-agent approach that systematically
integrates evidence-based teamwork components from human-human collaboration
into medical decision-making with large language models (LLMs). Our approach
validates an organizational psychology teamwork model from human collaboration
to computational multi-agent medical systems by operationalizing six core
teamwork components derived from Salas et al.'s "Big Five" model: team
leadership, mutual performance monitoring, team orientation, shared mental
models, closed-loop communication, and mutual trust. We implement and evaluate
these components as modular, configurable mechanisms within an adaptive
collaboration architecture while assessing the effect of the number of agents
involved based on the task's requirements and domain. Systematic evaluation of
computational implementations of teamwork behaviors across eight medical
benchmarks (MedQA, MedMCQA, MMLU-Pro Medical, PubMedQA, DDXPlus, MedBullets,
Path-VQA, and PMC-VQA) demonstrates consistent improvements across 7 out of 8
evaluated datasets. Controlled ablation studies conducted on 50 questions per
configuration across 3 independent runs provide mechanistic insights into
individual component contributions, revealing optimal teamwork configurations
that vary by reasoning task complexity and domain-specific requirements. Our
ablation analyses reveal dataset-specific optimal teamwork configurations,
indicating that different medical reasoning modalities benefit from distinct
collaborative patterns. TeamMedAgents represents an advancement in
collaborative AI by providing a systematic translation of established teamwork
theories from human collaboration into agentic collaboration, establishing a
foundation for evidence-based multi-agent system design in critical
decision-making domains.

Result: 实验表明，BlindGuard能有效检测多种攻击类型，且泛化能力优于监督基线方法。

Conclusion: BlindGuard为多智能体系统提供了一种实用且通用的无监督防御解决方案。

Abstract: The security of LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) is critically threatened
by propagation vulnerability, where malicious agents can distort collective
decision-making through inter-agent message interactions. While existing
supervised defense methods demonstrate promising performance, they may be
impractical in real-world scenarios due to their heavy reliance on labeled
malicious agents to train a supervised malicious detection model. To enable
practical and generalizable MAS defenses, in this paper, we propose BlindGuard,
an unsupervised defense method that learns without requiring any
attack-specific labels or prior knowledge of malicious behaviors. To this end,
we establish a hierarchical agent encoder to capture individual, neighborhood,
and global interaction patterns of each agent, providing a comprehensive
understanding for malicious agent detection. Meanwhile, we design a
corruption-guided detector that consists of directional noise injection and
contrastive learning, allowing effective detection model training solely on
normal agent behaviors. Extensive experiments show that BlindGuard effectively
detects diverse attack types (i.e., prompt injection, memory poisoning, and
tool attack) across MAS with various communication patterns while maintaining
superior generalizability compared to supervised baselines. The code is

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Large Language Models (LLMs)-assisted agent
that automatically converts natural-language descriptions of power system
optimization scenarios into compact, solver-ready formulations and generates
corresponding solutions. In contrast to approaches that rely solely on LLM to
produce solutions directly, the proposed method focuses on discovering a
mathematically compatible formulation that can be efficiently solved by
off-the-shelf optimization solvers. Directly using LLMs to produce solutions
often leads to infeasible or suboptimal results, as these models lack the
numerical precision and constraint-handling capabilities of established
optimization solvers. The pipeline integrates a domain-aware prompt and schema
with an LLM, enforces feasibility through systematic validation and iterative
repair, and returns both solver-ready models and user-facing results. Using the
unit commitment problem as a representative case study, the agent produces
optimal or near-optimal schedules along with the associated objective costs.
Results demonstrate that coupling the solver with task-specific validation
significantly enhances solution reliability. This work shows that combining AI
with established optimization frameworks bridges high-level problem
descriptions and executable mathematical models, enabling more efficient
decision-making in energy systems

equations. We report high VPT values (>30 Lyapunov times), as we are predicting
a noiseless system where overfitting can be beneficial. While these conditions
may not hold for noisy systems, they could still be useful for real-world
applications with limited noise. Furthermore, utilizing knowledge of the
Lyapunov exponent, we find that the VPT can be predicted by the error in the
first few prediction steps, offering a computationally efficient evaluation
method. We emphasize the importance of the numerical solver used to generate
the Lorenz dataset and define a Valid Ground Truth Time (VGTT), during which
the outputs of several common solvers agree. A VPT exceeding the VGTT is not
meaningful, as a different solver could produce a different result. Lastly, we
identify two spectral radius regimes that achieve large VPT: a small radius
near zero, resulting in simple but stable operation, and a larger radius
operating at the "edge of chaos."

### [391] [Geometry-Aware Spiking Graph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06793)
*Bowen Zhang,Genan Dai,Hu Huang,Long Lan*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出了一种几何感知的脉冲图神经网络（GSG），结合了脉冲神经网络的高能效和黎曼流形的自适应表示学习，解决了现有方法在复杂图结构建模中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的脉冲图神经网络主要在欧几里得空间中运行，依赖固定的几何假设，难以建模复杂图结构（如层次和循环）。

Method: GSG包含三个关键组件：黎曼嵌入层（将节点特征投影到常曲率流形）、流形脉冲层（在弯曲空间中建模膜电位和脉冲行为）和流形学习目标（通过联合优化的分类和链接预测损失实现几何自适应）。

Result: 实验表明，GSG在准确性、鲁棒性和能效上优于欧几里得脉冲神经网络和基于流形的图神经网络。

Conclusion: GSG为曲率感知、高能效的图学习建立了新范式。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
modeling graph-structured data, while Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer high
energy efficiency through sparse, event-driven computation. However, existing
spiking GNNs predominantly operate in Euclidean space and rely on fixed
geometric assumptions, limiting their capacity to model complex graph
structures such as hierarchies and cycles. To overcome these limitations, we
propose \method{}, a novel Geometry-Aware Spiking Graph Neural Network that
unifies spike-based neural dynamics with adaptive representation learning on
Riemannian manifolds. \method{} features three key components: a Riemannian
Embedding Layer that projects node features into a pool of constant-curvature
manifolds, capturing non-Euclidean structures; a Manifold Spiking Layer that
models membrane potential evolution and spiking behavior in curved spaces via
geometry-consistent neighbor aggregation and curvature-based attention; and a
Manifold Learning Objective that enables instance-wise geometry adaptation
through jointly optimized classification and link prediction losses defined
over geodesic distances. All modules are trained using Riemannian SGD,
eliminating the need for backpropagation through time. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmarks show that GSG achieves superior accuracy, robustness, and
energy efficiency compared to both Euclidean SNNs and manifold-based GNNs,
establishing a new paradigm for curvature-aware, energy-efficient graph
learning.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的MFO-DBO算法，通过引入分数阶微积分、混沌映射和扰动机制，显著提升了光伏模型参数识别的准确性和收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光伏模型参数识别因非线性、多模态和高维特性而具有挑战性，现有DBO算法易陷入早熟收敛。

Method: 结合分数阶微积分增强记忆效应、混沌映射提升种群多样性，以及混沌扰动机制避免局部最优。

Result: 在CEC2017基准测试和光伏参数识别问题中，MFO-DBO算法在准确性、鲁棒性和收敛速度上优于其他先进算法。

Conclusion: MFO-DBO算法显著提升了光伏参数识别的性能，并在探索与开发之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Accurate parameter identification in photovoltaic (PV) models is crucial for
performance evaluation but remains challenging due to their nonlinear,
multimodal, and high-dimensional nature. Although the Dung Beetle Optimization
(DBO) algorithm has shown potential in addressing such problems, it often
suffers from premature convergence. To overcome these issues, this paper
proposes a Memory Enhanced Fractional-Order Dung Beetle Optimization (MFO-DBO)
algorithm that integrates three coordinated strategies. Firstly,
fractional-order (FO) calculus introduces memory into the search process,
enhancing convergence stability and solution quality. Secondly, a
fractional-order logistic chaotic map improves population diversity during
initialization. Thirdly, a chaotic perturbation mechanism helps elite solutions
escape local optima. Numerical results on the CEC2017 benchmark suite and the
PV parameter identification problem demonstrate that MFO-DBO consistently
outperforms advanced DBO variants, CEC competition winners, FO-based
optimizers, enhanced classical algorithms, and recent metaheuristics in terms
of accuracy, robustness, convergence speed, while also maintaining an excellent
balance between exploration and exploitation compared to the standard DBO
algorithm.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在MOEA中直接集成基于汉明距离的均匀性度量方法，以增强决策空间多样性，并在饮食问题中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数MOEA专注于目标空间的优化，忽视了决策空间的多样性，而决策空间多样性对提供多样化选择至关重要。

Method: 在MOEA的选择机制中集成基于汉明距离的均匀性度量方法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持目标空间性能的同时，显著提高了决策空间多样性。

Conclusion: 该方法为MOEA提供了一种通用的决策空间多样性增强策略。

Abstract: Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are essential for solving
complex optimization problems, such as the diet problem, where balancing
conflicting objectives, like cost and nutritional content, is crucial. However,
most MOEAs focus on optimizing solutions in the objective space, often
neglecting the diversity of solutions in the decision space, which is critical
for providing decision-makers with a wide range of choices. This paper
introduces an approach that directly integrates a Hamming distance-based
measure of uniformity into the selection mechanism of a MOEA to enhance
decision space diversity. Experiments on a multi-objective formulation of the
diet problem demonstrate that our approach significantly improves decision
space diversity compared to NSGA-II, while maintaining comparable objective
space performance. The proposed method offers a generalizable strategy for
integrating decision space awareness into MOEAs.

Abstract: We present Evo-Sparrow, a deep learning-based agent for AI decision-making in
Sparrow Mahjong, trained by optimizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks
using Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). Our model
evaluates board states and optimizes decision policies in a non-deterministic,
partially observable game environment. Empirical analysis conducted over a
significant number of simulations demonstrates that our model outperforms both
random and rule-based agents, and achieves performance comparable to a Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) baseline, indicating strong strategic play and robust
policy quality. By combining deep learning with evolutionary optimization, our
approach provides a computationally effective alternative to traditional
reinforcement learning and gradient-based optimization methods. This research
contributes to the broader field of AI game playing, demonstrating the
viability of hybrid learning strategies for complex stochastic games. These
findings also offer potential applications in adaptive decision-making and
strategic AI development beyond Sparrow Mahjong.

Motivation: 解决复杂问题需要高效算法，但替代模型辅助的元启发式算法在能量效率和准确性方面仍需深入研究。

Method: 研究不同版本的粒子群优化算法（包括预训练和再训练的神经网络替代模型），分析其处理器和内存的能量消耗及替代模型准确性。

Result: 研究为替代模型辅助算法的评估提供了新视角，关注能量效率和准确性。

Conclusion: 这是首次从能量和准确性角度评估替代模型辅助算法，为优化和学习技术的全面表征奠定了基础。

Abstract: Solving complex real problems often demands advanced algorithms, and then
continuous improvements in the internal operations of a search technique are
needed. Hybrid algorithms, parallel techniques, theoretical advances, and much
more are needed to transform a general search algorithm into an efficient,
useful one in practice. In this paper, we study how surrogates are helping
metaheuristics from an important and understudied point of view: their energy
profile. Even if surrogates are a great idea for substituting a time-demanding
complex fitness function, the energy profile, general efficiency, and accuracy
of the resulting surrogate-assisted metaheuristic still need considerable
research. In this work, we make a first step in analyzing particle swarm
optimization in different versions (including pre-trained and retrained neural
networks as surrogates) for its energy profile (for both processor and memory),
plus a further study on the surrogate accuracy to properly drive the search
towards an acceptable solution. Our conclusions shed new light on this topic
and could be understood as the first step towards a methodology for assessing
surrogate-assisted algorithms not only accounting for time or numerical
efficiency but also for energy and surrogate accuracy for a better, more
holistic characterization of optimization and learning techniques.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索DGCA模型在形态发生中的潜力，特别是其能否生长出有效的储层结构。

Method: 使用DGCA模型训练生长储层，目标分为任务驱动（NARMA任务）和任务无关（储层指标）。

Result: DGCA生长的储层在基准任务中表现优异，统计上优于传统储层。

Conclusion: DGCA为开发可塑性储层和功能适应性形态发生模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Developmental Graph Cellular Automata (DGCA) are a novel model for
morphogenesis, capable of growing directed graphs from single-node seeds. In
this paper, we show that DGCAs can be trained to grow reservoirs. Reservoirs
are grown with two types of targets: task-driven (using the NARMA family of
tasks) and task-independent (using reservoir metrics).
  Results show that DGCAs are able to grow into a variety of specialized,
life-like structures capable of effectively solving benchmark tasks,
statistically outperforming `typical' reservoirs on the same task. Overall,
these lay the foundation for the development of DGCA systems that produce
plastic reservoirs and for modeling functional, adaptive morphogenesis.

TL;DR: 论文研究了GitHub上长期分叉（变体）的补丁集成问题，提出了一种名为RePatch的解决方案，能够处理代码重构导致的语义不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期分叉（变体）在独立开发过程中会出现代码结构漂移，导致补丁集成失败，传统工具无法有效解决这一问题。

Method: RePatch扩展了RefMerge框架，支持非对称补丁传输，通过反转重构操作对齐补丁上下文，再应用补丁并重放变换。

Result: 在478个补丁请求中，Git cherry-pick失败率为64.4%，而RePatch成功集成了52.8%的失败案例。

Conclusion: 结果表明，基于语义推理的工具在变体补丁传播中具有优势，传统语法工具存在局限性。

Abstract: While most forks on platforms like GitHub are short-lived and used for social
collaboration, a smaller but impactful subset evolve into long-lived forks,
referred to here as variants, that maintain independent development
trajectories. Integrating bug-fix patches across such divergent variants poses
challenges due to structural drift, including refactorings that rename,
relocate, or reorganize code elements and obscure semantic correspondence. This
paper presents an empirical study of patch integration failures in 14 divergent
pair of variants and introduces RePatch, a refactoring-aware integration system
for Java repositories. RePatch extends the RefMerge framework, originally
designed for symmetric merges, by supporting asymmetric patch transfer. RePatch
inverts refactorings in both the source and target to realign the patch
context, applies the patch, and replays the transformations to preserve the
intent of the variant. In our evaluation of 478 bug-fix pull requests, Git
cherry-pick fails in 64.4% of cases due to structural misalignments, while
RePatch successfully integrates 52.8% of the previously failing patches. These
results highlight the limitations of syntax-based tools and the need for
semantic reasoning in variant-aware patch propagation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RAGcceptance M2RE的新方法，利用检索增强生成（RAG）从多模态需求数据（包括文本和视觉UI信息）生成验收标准（ACs）。实验表明，该方法显著提升了ACs的相关性、正确性和可理解性，并减少了人工工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动创建准确、全面且无歧义的验收标准在用户界面密集型应用中具有挑战性，因为需要依赖领域知识和视觉上下文。

Method: 采用检索增强生成（RAG）技术，结合文本和视觉UI信息生成验收标准。

Result: 多模态信息的整合显著提升了生成的ACs的质量，并减少了人工工作量。

Conclusion: 多模态RAG技术在优化软件验证流程和提高开发效率方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Acceptance criteria (ACs) play a critical role in software development by
clearly defining the conditions under which a software feature satisfies
stakeholder expectations. However, manually creating accurate, comprehensive,
and unambiguous acceptance criteria is challenging, particularly in user
interface-intensive applications, due to the reliance on domain-specific
knowledge and visual context that is not always captured by textual
requirements alone. To address these challenges, we propose RAGcceptance M2RE,
a novel approach that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to
generate acceptance criteria from multi-modal requirements data, including both
textual documentation and visual UI information. We systematically evaluated
our approach in an industrial case study involving an education-focused
software system used by approximately 100,000 users. The results indicate that
integrating multi-modal information significantly enhances the relevance,
correctness, and comprehensibility of the generated ACs. Moreover, practitioner
evaluations confirm that our approach effectively reduces manual effort,
captures nuanced stakeholder intent, and provides valuable criteria that domain
experts may overlook, demonstrating practical utility and significant potential
for industry adoption. This research underscores the potential of multi-modal
RAG techniques in streamlining software validation processes and improving
development efficiency. We also make our implementation and a dataset
available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在直接翻译C代码到Rust时，难以处理语法规则和语义一致性，导致翻译结果不理想。

Method: IRENE包含三个模块：规则增强检索模块、结构化摘要模块和错误驱动翻译模块，分别提升规则处理、语义理解和翻译迭代优化。

Result: 在两个数据集（xCodeEval和HW-Bench）和八个LLM上评估，IRENE在翻译准确性和安全性上表现优异。

Conclusion: IRENE通过整合规则和语义，显著提升了C到Rust代码翻译的质量和安全性。

Abstract: Automated translation of legacy C code into Rust aims to ensure memory safety
while reducing the burden of manual migration. Early approaches in code
translation rely on static rule-based methods, but they suffer from limited
coverage due to dependence on predefined rule patterns. Recent works regard the
task as a sequence-to-sequence problem by leveraging large language models
(LLMs). Although these LLM-based methods are capable of reducing unsafe code
blocks, the translated code often exhibits issues in following Rust rules and
maintaining semantic consistency. On one hand, existing methods adopt a direct
prompting strategy to translate the C code, which struggles to accommodate the
syntactic rules between C and Rust. On the other hand, this strategy makes it
difficult for LLMs to accurately capture the semantics of complex code. To
address these challenges, we propose IRENE, an LLM-based framework that
Integrates RulEs aNd sEmantics to enhance translation. IRENE consists of three
modules: 1) a rule-augmented retrieval module that selects relevant translation
examples based on rules generated from a static analyzer developed by us,
thereby improving the handling of Rust rules; 2) a structured summarization
module that produces a structured summary for guiding LLMs to enhance the
semantic understanding of C code; 3) an error-driven translation module that
leverages compiler diagnostics to iteratively refine translations. We evaluate
IRENE on two datasets (xCodeEval, a public dataset, and HW-Bench, an industrial
dataset provided by Huawei) and eight LLMs, focusing on translation accuracy
and safety.

<details>

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）能力的增强，其在智能客服、代码生成等领域的应用日益广泛，但自然语言提示的歧义性限制了其效果。

Method: CNL-P通过引入精确的语法结构和语义规范，结合提示工程和软件工程原则，并开发了NL2CNL-P转换工具和语法检查工具。

Result: 实验表明，CNL-P显著提高了LLM输出的质量和一致性。

Conclusion: CNL-P为新兴提示工程与传统软件工程之间的桥梁，为以自然语言为中心的新编程范式奠定了基础。

Abstract: With the growing capabilities of large language models (LLMs), they are
increasingly applied in areas like intelligent customer service, code
generation, and knowledge management. Natural language (NL) prompts act as the
``APIs'' for human-LLM interaction. To improve prompt quality, best practices
for prompt engineering (PE) have been developed, including writing guidelines
and templates. Building on this, we propose Controlled NL for Prompt (CNL-P),
which not only incorporates PE best practices but also draws on key principles
from software engineering (SE). CNL-P introduces precise grammar structures and
strict semantic norms, further eliminating NL's ambiguity, allowing for a
declarative but structured and accurate expression of user intent. This helps
LLMs better interpret and execute the prompts, leading to more consistent and
higher-quality outputs. We also introduce an NL2CNL-P conversion tool based on
LLMs, enabling users to write prompts in NL, which are then transformed into
CNL-P format, thus lowering the learning curve of CNL-P. In particular, we
develop a linting tool that checks CNL-P prompts for syntactic and semantic
accuracy, applying static analysis techniques to NL for the first time.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CNL-P enhances the quality of LLM
responses through the novel and organic synergy of PE and SE. We believe that
CNL-P can bridge the gap between emerging PE and traditional SE, laying the
foundation for a new programming paradigm centered around NL.

Motivation: 研究动机是理解方法级代码变更对性能演化的影响，填补开发者直觉假设与实证验证之间的空白。

Method: 研究分析了15个成熟开源Java项目的739次提交，使用JMH进行性能测量，并通过字节码插桩和统计分析量化性能变化。

Result: 32.7%的方法级变更对性能有显著影响，性能退化比改进多1.3倍。算法变更风险高但改进潜力大，资深开发者表现更稳定。

Conclusion: 研究建议将自动化性能测试集成到持续集成流程中，以应对性能不稳定性。

Abstract: Performance is a critical quality attribute in software development, yet the
impact of method-level code changes on performance evolution remains poorly
understood. While developers often make intuitive assumptions about which types
of modifications are likely to cause performance regressions or improvements,
these beliefs lack empirical validation at a fine-grained level. We conducted a
large-scale empirical study analyzing performance evolution in 15 mature
open-source Java projects hosted on GitHub. Our analysis encompassed 739
commits containing 1,499 method-level code changes, using Java Microbenchmark
Harness (JMH) for precise performance measurement and rigorous statistical
analysis to quantify both the significance and magnitude of performance
variations. We employed bytecode instrumentation to capture method-specific
execution metrics and systematically analyzed four key aspects: temporal
performance patterns, code change type correlations, developer and complexity
factors, and domain-size interactions. Our findings reveal that 32.7% of
method-level changes result in measurable performance impacts, with regressions
occurring 1.3 times more frequently than improvements. Contrary to conventional
wisdom, we found no significant differences in performance impact distributions
across code change categories, challenging risk-stratified development
strategies. Algorithmic changes demonstrate the highest improvement potential
but carry substantial regression risk. Senior developers produce more stable
changes with fewer extreme variations, while code complexity correlates with
increased regression likelihood. Domain-size interactions reveal significant
patterns, with web server + small projects exhibiting the highest performance
instability. Our study provides empirical evidence for integrating automated
performance testing into continuous integration pipelines.

Result: 在用户研究中，CLARITY显著提升了用户理解和分类警告的速度与信心，且规则反馈减少了所需交互次数。

Conclusion: CLARITY通过主动学习的总结方法，有效增强了警告的交互式理解过程。

Abstract: Programmers using bug-finding tools often review their reported warnings one
by one. Based on the insight that identifying recurring themes and
relationships can enhance the cognitive process of sensemaking, we propose
CLARITY, which supports interpreting tool-generated warnings through
interactive inquiry. CLARITY derives summary rules for custom grouping of
related warnings with active feedback. As users mark warnings as interesting or
uninteresting, CLARITY's rule inference algorithm surfaces common symptoms,
highlighting structural similarities in containment, subtyping, invoked
methods, accessed fields, and expressions.
  We demonstrate CLARITY on Infer and SpotBugs warnings across two mature Java
projects. In a within-subject user study with 14 participants, users
articulated root causes for similar uninteresting warnings faster and with more
confidence using CLARITY. We observed significant individual variation in
desired grouping, reinforcing the need for customizable sensemaking. Simulation
shows that with rule-level feedback, only 11.8 interactions are needed on
average to align all inferred rules with a simulated user's labels (vs. 17.8
without). Our evaluation suggests that CLARITY's active learning-based
summarization enhances interactive warning sensemaking.

Result: 评估显示模型在复杂逻辑和跨语言任务中表现较差，但在Python库任务中较强。

Conclusion: CODE2BENCH提供了一种动态、污染抵抗性的基准构建方法，为LLM评估提供了更全面的基础。

Abstract: As large language models LLMs) become increasingly integrated into software
development workflows, rigorously evaluating their performance on complex,
real-world code generation tasks has become essential. However, existing
benchmarks often suffer from data contamination and limited test rigor,
constraining their ability to reveal model failures effectively. To address
these, we present CODE2BENCH, a end-to-end pipeline for dynamically
constructing robust and contamination-resistant benchmarks from real-world
GitHub repositories. Specifically, CODE2BENCH introduces three key innovations:
(1) Automated Dynamism, achieved through periodic ingestion of recent code to
minimize training data contamination; (2) Scope Graph-based dependency
analysis, which enables structured classification of functions into benchmark
instances with controlled dependency levels (distinguishing between
Self-Contained (SC) tasks for cross-language evaluation and Weakly
Self-Contained (WSC) tasks involving permitted library usage); and (3)
Property-Based Testing (PBT) for the automated synthesis of rigorous test
suites to enable thorough functional verification. Using this pipeline, we
construct CODE2BENCH-2505, the first benchmark derived from 880 recent Python
projects spanning diverse domains, comprising 1,163 code generation tasks with
100% average branch coverage on ground-truth implementations. Extensive
evaluation of 16 LLMs using CODE2BENCH-2505 reveals that models consistently
struggle with SC tasks requiring complex, non-standard logic and cross-language
transfer, while showing relatively stronger performance on WSC tasks in Python.
Our work introduces a contamination-resistant, language-agnostic methodology
for dynamic benchmark construction, offering a principled foundation for the
comprehensive and realistic evaluation of LLMs on real-world software
development tasks.

Motivation: 现有污点分析工具缺乏终端用户调试功能，无法回答关于数据流的“为什么”、“为什么不”和“假设”问题，且可视化方式难以全局分析多源多汇的连接性。

Method: 提出TraceLens，支持用户通过问答形式调试污点分析结果，包括推测性假设分析，以评估不同连接假设的影响。

Result: 用户研究表明，TraceLens用户平均准确率比CodeQL高21%，心理负担降低45%，且对识别相关数据流的信心更高。

Conclusion: TraceLens通过问答式调试界面显著提升了污点分析的终端用户体验和效果。

Abstract: Taint analysis is a security analysis technique used to track the flow of
potentially dangerous data through an application and its dependent libraries.
Investigating why certain unexpected flows appear and why expected flows are
missing is an important sensemaking process during end-user taint analysis.
Existing taint analysis tools often do not provide this end-user debugging
capability, where developers can ask why, why-not, and what-if questions about
dataflows and reason about the impact of configuring sources and sinks, and
models of 3rd-party libraries that abstract permissible and impermissible data
flows. Furthermore, a tree-view or a list-view used in existing
taint-analyzer's visualization makes it difficult to reason about the global
impact on connectivity between multiple sources and sinks.
  Inspired by the insight that sensemaking tool-generated results can be
significantly improved by a QA inquiry process, we propose TraceLens, a first
end-user question-answer style debugging interface for taint analysis. It
enables a user to ask why, why-not, and what-if questions to investigate the
existence of suspicious flows, the non-existence of expected flows, and the
global impact of third-party library models. TraceLens performs speculative
what-if analysis, to help a user in debugging how different connectivity
assumptions affect overall results. A user study with 12 participants shows
that participants using TraceLens achieved 21% higher accuracy on average,
compared to CodeQL. They also reported a 45% reduction in mental demand
(NASA-TLX) and rated higher confidence in identifying relevant flows using
TraceLens.

Abstract: As the complexity of software systems continues to increase, the demand for
automated testing and maintenance tools is growing exponentially. To meet this
urgent need, we propose a new assertion generation method based on Hardware

TL;DR: Mo2oM框架通过软聚类方法将单体应用分解为微服务，显著提升了结构模块化和服务间通信效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有微服务提取方法通常采用硬聚类，导致服务间耦合增加和内部凝聚力降低，Mo2oM旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合深度语义嵌入和结构依赖，利用图神经网络进行软聚类，生成微服务。

Result: 在四个开源基准测试中，Mo2oM在结构模块化、通信开销等方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Mo2oM通过软聚类方法有效优化了微服务分解，提升了系统的可维护性和灵活性。

Abstract: Modern software systems are increasingly shifting from monolithic
architectures to microservices to enhance scalability, maintainability, and
deployment flexibility. Existing microservice extraction methods typically rely
on hard clustering, assigning each software component to a single microservice.
This approach often increases inter-service coupling and reduces intra-service
cohesion. We propose Mo2oM (Monolithic to Overlapping Microservices), a
framework that formulates microservice extraction as a soft clustering problem,
allowing components to belong probabilistically to multiple microservices. This
approach is inspired by expert-driven decompositions, where practitioners
intentionally replicate certain software components across services to reduce
communication overhead. Mo2oM combines deep semantic embeddings with structural
dependencies extracted from methodcall graphs to capture both functional and
architectural relationships. A graph neural network-based soft clustering
algorithm then generates the final set of microservices. We evaluate Mo2oM on
four open-source monolithic benchmarks and compare it against eight
state-of-the-art baselines. Our results demonstrate that Mo2oM achieves
improvements of up to 40.97% in structural modularity (balancing cohesion and
coupling), 58% in inter-service call percentage (communication overhead),
26.16% in interface number (modularity and decoupling), and 38.96% in
non-extreme distribution (service size balance) across all benchmarks.

Motivation: DigiTraffic提供了大量实时道路传感器数据，但如何高效利用这些数据并理解其质量、预处理和机器学习工具的应用是关键挑战。

Method: 通过分析DigiTraffic的道路天气相关属性，提出了一种数据利用方法，并构建了一个基于简单路由应用的个性化道路推荐引擎。

Result: 基于真实数据验证，该方法能有效识别并为三种不同驾驶员档案推荐个性化路线。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过合理的数据预处理和机器学习工具，可以高效利用大规模道路数据实现个性化推荐。

Abstract: Digitraffic, Finland's open road data interface, provides access to
nationwide road sensors with more than 2,300 real-time attributes from 1,814
stations. However, efficiently utilizing such a versatile data API for a
practical application requires a deeper understanding of the data qualities,
preprocessing phases, and machine learning tools. This paper discusses the
challenges of large-scale road weather and traffic data. We go through the
road-weather-related attributes from DigiTraffic as a practical example of
processes required to work with such a dataset. In addition, we provide a
methodology for efficient data utilization for the target application, a
personalized road recommendation engine based on a simple routing application.
We validate our solution based on real-world data, showing we can efficiently
identify and recommend personalized routes for three different driver profiles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常处理方案对异常处理不够深入，无法追溯到推理阶段的根本原因，且恢复逻辑脆弱。

Method: 提出SHIELDA框架，包括异常分类器、处理模式注册表和结构化执行器，实现阶段感知的恢复。

Result: 通过AutoPR代理的案例研究验证了SHIELDA的有效性，成功从推理引发的异常中恢复。

Conclusion: SHIELDA为LLM代理工作流提供了有效的异常处理解决方案，能够链接异常到根本原因并支持可组合策略。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agentic systems are software systems powered by
LLMs that autonomously reason, plan, and execute multi-step workflows to
achieve human goals, rather than merely executing predefined steps. During
execution, these workflows frequently encounter exceptions. Existing exception
handling solutions often treat exceptions superficially, failing to trace
execution-phase exceptions to their reasoning-phase root causes. Furthermore,
their recovery logic is brittle, lacking structured escalation pathways when
initial attempts fail. To tackle these challenges, we first present a
comprehensive taxonomy of 36 exception types across 12 agent artifacts.
Building on this, we propose SHIELDA (Structured Handling of Exceptions in
LLM-Driven Agentic Workflows), a modular runtime exception handling framework
for LLM agentic workflows. SHIELDA uses an exception classifier to select a
predefined exception handling pattern from a handling pattern registry. These
patterns are then executed via a structured handling executor, comprising local
handling, flow control, and state recovery, to enable phase-aware recovery by
linking exceptions to their root causes and facilitating composable strategies.
We validate SHIELDA's effectiveness through a case study on the AutoPR agent,
demonstrating effective, cross-phase recovery from a reasoning-induced
exception.

Motivation: 探索开发者如何与CBAs互动，以及CBAs未能满足开发者需求的原因，以改进其设计。

Method: 通过用户研究（n=16）和访谈，分析开发者使用CBAs时的行为和反馈。

Result: 用户满意度低（均分2.8/5），主要问题为功能不足（77%）、代码质量差（42%）和沟通问题（25%）。

Conclusion: 提出了六项挑战和五项障碍，并比较了21款商业CBAs，为设计更高效的CBAs提供了机会。

Abstract: Recent AI code assistants have significantly improved their ability to
process more complex contexts and generate entire codebases based on a textual
description, compared to the popular snippet-level generation. These codebase
AI assistants (CBAs) can also extend or adapt codebases, allowing users to
focus on higher-level design and deployment decisions. While prior work has
extensively studied the impact of snippet-level code generation, this new class
of codebase generation models is relatively unexplored. Despite initial
anecdotal reports of excitement about these agents, they remain less frequently
adopted compared to snippet-level code assistants. To utilize CBAs better, we
need to understand how developers interact with CBAs, and how and why CBAs fall
short of developers' needs. In this paper, we explored these gaps through a
counterbalanced user study and interview with (n = 16) students and developers
working on coding tasks with CBAs. We found that participants varied the
information in their prompts, like problem description (48% of prompts),
required functionality (98% of prompts), code structure (48% of prompts), and
their prompt writing process. Despite various strategies, the overall
satisfaction score with generated codebases remained low (mean = 2.8, median =
3, on a scale of one to five). Participants mentioned functionality as the most
common factor for dissatisfaction (77% of instances), alongside poor code
quality (42% of instances) and communication issues (25% of instances). We
delve deeper into participants' dissatisfaction to identify six underlying
challenges that participants faced when using CBAs, and extracted five barriers
to incorporating CBAs into their workflows. Finally, we surveyed 21 commercial
CBAs to compare their capabilities with participant challenges and present
design opportunities for more efficient and useful CBAs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Python缺乏形式化验证工具，而C语言已有成熟工具。PyVeritas旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过LLM将Python代码转译为C，再利用C的模型检查工具进行验证和故障定位。

Result: 实验表明，LLM转译准确率可达80-90%，支持小规模Python程序的验证和故障诊断。

Conclusion: PyVeritas为Python程序提供了有效的形式化验证和故障定位方法。

Abstract: Python has become the dominant language for general-purpose programming, yet
it lacks robust tools for formal verification. In contrast, programmers working
in languages such as C benefit from mature model checkers, for example CBMC,
which enable exhaustive symbolic reasoning and fault localisation. The inherent
complexity of Python, coupled with the verbosity and low-level nature of
existing transpilers (e.g., Cython), have historically limited the
applicability of formal verification to Python programs.
  In this paper, we propose PyVeritas, a novel framework that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs) for high-level transpilation from Python to C, followed
by bounded model checking and MaxSAT-based fault localisation in the generated
C code. PyVeritas enables verification and bug localisation for Python code
using existing model checking tools for C. Our empirical evaluation on two
Python benchmarks demonstrates that LLM-based transpilation can achieve a high
degree of accuracy, up to 80--90% for some LLMs, enabling effective development
environment that supports assertion-based verification and interpretable fault
diagnosis for small yet non-trivial Python programs.

Motivation: 现有投标遮光方法受限于单峰假设和离散化模型的依赖性问题，无法适应非凸剩余曲线，且易受级联误差影响。

Method: GBS包括两部分：(1)端到端生成模型，通过逐步残差生成遮光比率；(2)奖励偏好对齐系统，结合CHNet和GRPO优化短期与长期剩余。

Result: 离线和在线A/B测试验证了GBS的有效性，并已部署在美团DSP平台上，每日处理数十亿投标请求。

Conclusion: GBS通过创新方法解决了现有技术的局限性，并在实际应用中表现出色。

Abstract: Bid shading plays a crucial role in Real-Time Bidding~(RTB) by adaptively
adjusting the bid to avoid advertisers overspending. Existing mainstream
two-stage methods, which first model bid landscapes and then optimize surplus
using operations research techniques, are constrained by unimodal assumptions
that fail to adapt for non-convex surplus curves and are vulnerable to
cascading errors in sequential workflows. Additionally, existing discretization
models of continuous values ignore the dependence between discrete intervals,
reducing the model's error correction ability, while sample selection bias in
bidding scenarios presents further challenges for prediction. To address these
issues, this paper introduces Generative Bid Shading~(GBS), which comprises two
primary components: (1) an end-to-end generative model that utilizes an
autoregressive approach to generate shading ratios by stepwise residuals,
capturing complex value dependencies without relying on predefined priors; and
(2) a reward preference alignment system, which incorporates a channel-aware
hierarchical dynamic network~(CHNet) as the reward model to extract
fine-grained features, along with modules for surplus optimization and
exploration utility reward alignment, ultimately optimizing both short-term and
long-term surplus using group relative policy optimization~(GRPO). Extensive
experiments on both offline and online A/B tests validate GBS's effectiveness.
Moreover, GBS has been deployed on the Meituan DSP platform, serving billions
of bid requests daily.

Result: 算法收敛到2α-纳什均衡，α取决于网络最大不对称性；线性二次网络游戏中α表现良好。

Conclusion: α-势函数为分析网络博弈提供了有效工具，改进算法能收敛到近似均衡，且社会福祉有界。

Abstract: In a network game, players interact over a network and the utility of each
player depends on his own action and on an aggregate of his neighbours'
actions. Many real world networks of interest are asymmetric and involve a
large number of heterogeneous players. This paper analyzes static network games
using the framework of $\alpha$-potential games. Under mild assumptions on the
action sets (compact intervals) and the utility functions (twice continuously
differentiable) of the players, we derive an expression for an inexact
potential function of the game, called the $\alpha$-potential function. Using
such a function, we show that modified versions of the sequential best-response
algorithm and the simultaneous gradient play algorithm achieve convergence of
players' actions to a $2\alpha$-Nash equilibrium. For linear-quadratic network
games, we show that $\alpha$ depends on the maximum asymmetry in the network
and is well-behaved for a wide range of networks of practical interest.
Further, we derive bounds on the social welfare of the $\alpha$-Nash
equilibrium corresponding to the maximum of the $\alpha$-potential function,
under suitable assumptions. We numerically illustrate the convergence of the
proposed algorithms and properties of the learned $2\alpha$-Nash equilibria.

Result: RCPI在数值实验中表现优于其他收敛算法数个数量级。

Conclusion: RCPI是一种高效且可靠的算法，解决了FT算法的收敛问题。

Abstract: Markov games and robust MDPs are closely related models that involve
computing a pair of saddle point policies. As part of the long-standing effort
to develop efficient algorithms for these models, the Filar-Tolwinski (FT)
algorithm has shown considerable promise. As our first contribution, we
demonstrate that FT may fail to converge to a saddle point and may loop
indefinitely, even in small games. This observation contradicts the proof of
FT's convergence to a saddle point in the original paper. As our second
contribution, we propose Residual Conditioned Policy Iteration (RCPI). RCPI
builds on FT, but is guaranteed to converge to a saddle point. Our numerical
results show that RCPI outperforms other convergent algorithms by several
orders of magnitude.

Motivation: 现有研究忽视了玩家自愿退出的自由，限制了承诺机制在现实场景中的应用。

Method: 采用两阶段博弈模型，分析承诺接受和合作行为，并引入严格和灵活的制度激励进行比较。

Result: 自愿参与提高了承诺接受率但未能促进合作，灵活激励在某些情况下更高效。

Conclusion: 单纯依赖自愿参与和承诺不足以解决社会困境，需设计合理的制度激励。

Abstract: Commitment is a well-established mechanism for fostering cooperation in human
society and multi-agent systems. However, existing research has predominantly
focused on the commitment that neglects the freedom of players to abstain from
an interaction, limiting their applicability to many real-world scenarios where
participation is often voluntary. In this paper, we present a two-stage game
model to investigate the evolution of commitment-based behaviours and
cooperation within the framework of the optional Prisoner's Dilemma game. In
the pre-game stage, players decide whether to accept a mutual commitment. Once
in the game, they choose among cooperation, defection, or exiting, depending on
the formation of a pre-game commitment. We find that optional participation
boosts commitment acceptance but fails to foster cooperation, leading instead
to widespread exit behaviour. To address this, we then introduce and compare
two institutional incentive approaches: i) a strict one (STRICT-COM) that
rewards only committed players who cooperate in the game, and ii) a flexible
one (FLEXIBLE-COM) that rewards any committed players who do not defect in the
game. The results reveal that, while the strict approach is demonstrably better
for promoting cooperation as the flexible rule creates a loophole for an
opportunistic exit after committing, the flexible rule offers an efficient
alternative for enhancing social welfare when such opportunistic behaviour
results in a high gain. This study highlights the limitations of relying solely
on voluntary participation and commitment to resolving social dilemmas,
emphasising the importance of well-designed institutional incentives to promote
cooperation and social welfare effectively.

Result: 研究发现竞争是实现最优结果的必要条件，并提出了有效的路由机制。

Conclusion: 竞争是实现最优路由分配的关键因素，提出的机制为实际应用提供了理论基础。

Abstract: The inefficiency of selfish routing in congested networks is a classical
problem in algorithmic game theory, often captured by the Price of Anarchy
(i.e., the ratio between the social cost of decentralized decisions and that of
a centrally optimized solution.) With the advent of autonomous vehicles,
capable of receiving and executing centrally assigned routes, it is natural to
ask whether their deployment can eliminate this inefficiency. At first glance,
a central authority could simply compute an optimal traffic assignment and
instruct each vehicle to follow its assigned path. However, this vision
overlooks critical challenges: routes must be individually rational (no vehicle
has an incentive to deviate), and in practice, multiple planning agents (e.g.,
different companies) may coexist and compete. Surprisingly, we show that such
competition is not merely an obstacle but a necessary ingredient for achieving
optimal outcomes. In this work, we design a routing mechanism that embraces
competition and converges to an optimal assignment, starting from the classical
Pigou network as a foundational case.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Jackson和Wilkie模型中因无限制同时承诺导致的效率损失问题。

Method: 引入分阶段承诺协议，玩家只能以小额、有上限的增量在多轮中承诺转移支付，且需全体同意才能继续。

Result: 证明该协议能从任何有限博弈中实现严格帕累托改进的福利最大化收益。

Conclusion: 分阶段和有界的承诺恢复了转移支付的全部效率潜力，避免了效率损失。

Abstract: We examine normal-form games in which players may \emph{pre-commit} to
outcome-contingent transfers before choosing their actions. In the one-shot
version of this model, Jackson and Wilkie showed that side contracting can
backfire: even a game with a Pareto-optimal Nash equilibrium can devolve into
inefficient equilibria once unbounded, simultaneous commitments are allowed.
The root cause is a prisoner's dilemma effect, where each player can exploit
her commitment power to reshape the equilibrium in her favor, harming overall
welfare.
  To circumvent this problem we introduce a \emph{staged-commitment} protocol.
Players may pledge transfers only in small, capped increments over multiple
rounds, and the phase continues only with unanimous consent. We prove that,
starting from any finite game $\Gamma$ with a non-degenerate Nash equilibrium
$\vec{\sigma}$, this protocol implements every welfare-maximizing payoff
profile that \emph{strictly} Pareto-improves $\vec{\sigma}$. Thus, gradual and
bounded commitments restore the full efficiency potential of side payments
while avoiding the inefficiencies identified by Jackson and Wilkie.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nash均衡（NE）在不完全信息扩展形式博弈（EFG）中无法确保非均衡路径上的最优策略，而现有EFPE算法因固定扰动和平均策略收敛问题存在显著不足。

Method: 提出RTCFR算法，通过奖励转换反事实后悔最小化解决扰动博弈，并引入信息集Nash均衡（ISNE）动态调整扰动。

Result: 理论分析验证了算法收敛到EFPE，实验表明其在NE和EFPE任务中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RTCFR算法高效解决了EFPE计算问题，为博弈论中的均衡细化提供了新思路。

Abstract: The Nash Equilibrium (NE) assumes rational play in imperfect-information
Extensive-Form Games (EFGs) but fails to ensure optimal strategies for
off-equilibrium branches of the game tree, potentially leading to suboptimal
outcomes in practical settings. To address this, the Extensive-Form Perfect
Equilibrium (EFPE), a refinement of NE, introduces controlled perturbations to
model potential player errors. However, existing EFPE-finding algorithms, which
typically rely on average strategy convergence and fixed perturbations, face
significant limitations: computing average strategies incurs high computational
costs and approximation errors, while fixed perturbations create a trade-off
between NE approximation accuracy and the convergence rate of NE refinements.
  To tackle these challenges, we propose an efficient adaptive regret
minimization algorithm for computing approximate EFPE, achieving last-iterate
convergence in two-player zero-sum EFGs. Our approach introduces Reward
Transformation Counterfactual Regret Minimization (RTCFR) to solve perturbed
games and defines a novel metric, the Information Set Nash Equilibrium (ISNE),
to dynamically adjust perturbations. Theoretical analysis confirms convergence
to EFPE, and experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in both NE and EFPE-finding tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we study a truthful two-obnoxious-facility location problem,
in which each agent has a private location in [0, 1] and a public optional
preference over two obnoxious facilities, and there is a minimum distance
constraint d between the two facilities. Each agent wants to be as far away as
possible from the facilities that affect her, and the utility of each agent is
the total distance from her to these facilities. The goal is to decide how to
place the facilities in [0, 1] so as to incentivize agents to report their
private locations truthfully as well as maximize the social utility. First, we
consider the special setting where d = 0, that is, the two facilities can be
located at any point in [0, 1]. We propose a deterministic strategyproof
mechanism with approximation ratio of at most 4 and a randomized strategyproof
mechanism with approximation ratio of at most 2, respectively. Then we study
the general setting. We propose a deterministic strategyproof mechanism with
approximation ratio of at most 8 and a randomized strategyproof mechanism with
approximation ratio of at most 4, respectively. Furthermore, we provide lower
bounds of 2 and 14/13 on the approximation ratio for any deterministic and any
randomized strategyproof mechanism, respectively.

problem, where a set of agents with private locations on the real line are
divided into disjoint groups. The constraint means that the facilities can only
be built in a given multiset of candidate locations and at most one facility
can be built at each candidate location. Given the locations of the two
facilities, the cost of an agent is the distance from her location to the
farthest facility (referred to as max-variant). Our goal is to design
strategyproof distributed mechanisms that can incentivize all agents to
truthfully report their locations and approximately optimize some social
objective. A distributed mechanism consists of two steps: for each group, the
mechanism chooses two candidate locations as the representatives of the group
based only on the locations reported by agents therein; then, it outputs two
facility locations among all the representatives. We focus on a class of
deterministic strategyproof distributed mechanisms and analyze upper and lower
bounds on the distortion under the Average-of-Average cost (average of the
average individual cost of agents in each group), the Max-of-Max cost (maximum
individual cost among all agents), the Average-of-Max cost (average of the
maximum individual cost among all agents in each group) and the Max-of-Average
cost (maximum of the average individual cost of all agents in each group).
Under four social objectives, we obtain constant upper and lower distortion
bounds.

*Christos Tsirigotis,Vaibhav Adlakha,Joao Monteiro,Aaron Courville,Perouz Taslakian*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: BiXSE是一种基于二元交叉熵的点式训练方法，利用LLM生成的细粒度相关性标签优化密集检索模型，性能优于对比学习，且标注和计算成本更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的相关性通常是连续的，而传统方法依赖二元标签。LLM的发展使得生成细粒度标签成为可能，BiXSE旨在利用这些标签提升模型性能。

Method: BiXSE通过二元交叉熵优化LLM生成的细粒度相关性分数，将其视为概率目标，实现单查询-文档对的细粒度监督，并利用批内负样本降低标注和计算成本。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，BiXSE性能优于基于softmax的对比学习（InfoNCE），并与强排序基线相当或超越。

Conclusion: BiXSE为密集检索模型提供了一种高效、可扩展的训练方法，尤其适用于细粒度相关性标注的场景。

Abstract: Neural sentence embedding models for dense retrieval typically rely on binary
relevance labels, treating query-document pairs as either relevant or
irrelevant. However, real-world relevance often exists on a continuum, and
recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made it feasible to scale
the generation of fine-grained graded relevance labels. In this work, we
propose BiXSE, a simple and effective pointwise training method that optimizes
binary cross-entropy (BCE) over LLM-generated graded relevance scores. BiXSE
interprets these scores as probabilistic targets, enabling granular supervision
from a single labeled query-document pair per query. Unlike pairwise or
listwise losses that require multiple annotated comparisons per query, BiXSE
achieves strong performance with reduced annotation and compute costs by
leveraging in-batch negatives. Extensive experiments across sentence embedding
(MMTEB) and retrieval benchmarks (BEIR, TREC-DL) show that BiXSE consistently
outperforms softmax-based contrastive learning (InfoNCE), and matches or
exceeds strong pairwise ranking baselines when trained on LLM-supervised data.
BiXSE offers a robust, scalable alternative for training dense retrieval models
as graded relevance supervision becomes increasingly accessible.

*Huanwei Xu,Lin Xu,Liang Yuan*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: CLAP是一种轻量级的LLM扩展框架，通过解决核心引用链和生成局部伪查询，提升密集检索器的性能，尤其在跨领域场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM扩展方法在密集检索器中表现不佳，主要由于语义漂移和与预训练语义空间不对齐，且段落中仅部分内容与查询相关，其余部分引入噪声。

Method: CLAP将段落分割为连贯块，解决核心引用链，生成与密集检索器表示对齐的局部伪查询，并结合全局主题信号与细粒度子主题信号。

Result: CLAP显著提升密集检索器性能，在跨领域场景中表现尤为突出，nDCG@10提升高达20.68%。

Conclusion: CLAP通过逻辑中心化的流程实现了鲁棒且领域无关的泛化，优于传统依赖领域知识的LLM扩展方法。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based passage expansion has shown promise for
enhancing first-stage retrieval, but often underperforms with dense retrievers
due to semantic drift and misalignment with their pretrained semantic space.
Beyond this, only a portion of a passage is typically relevant to a query,
while the rest introduces noise--an issue compounded by chunking techniques
that break coreference continuity. We propose Coreference-Linked Augmentation
for Passage Retrieval (CLAP), a lightweight LLM-based expansion framework that
segments passages into coherent chunks, resolves coreference chains, and
generates localized pseudo-queries aligned with dense retriever
representations. A simple fusion of global topical signals and fine-grained
subtopic signals achieves robust performance across domains. CLAP yields
consistent gains even as retriever strength increases, enabling dense
retrievers to match or surpass second-stage rankers such as BM25 + MonoT5-3B,
with up to 20.68% absolute nDCG@10 improvement. These improvements are
especially notable in out-of-domain settings, where conventional LLM-based
expansion methods relying on domain knowledge often falter. CLAP instead adopts
a logic-centric pipeline that enables robust, domain-agnostic generalization.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了推理密集型重排序器的性能，为复杂排序任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) based listwise ranking has shown superior
performance in many passage ranking tasks. With the development of Large
Reasoning Models, many studies have demonstrated that step-by-step reasoning
during test-time helps improve listwise ranking performance. However, due to
the scarcity of reasoning-intensive training data, existing rerankers perform
poorly in many complex ranking scenarios and the ranking ability of
reasoning-intensive rerankers remains largely underdeveloped. In this paper, we
first propose an automated reasoning-intensive training data synthesis
framework, which sources training queries and passages from diverse domains and
applies DeepSeek-R1 to generate high-quality training labels. A
self-consistency data filtering mechanism is designed to ensure the data
quality. To empower the listwise reranker with strong reasoning ability, we
further propose a two-stage post-training approach, which includes a cold-start
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage for reasoning pattern learning and a
reinforcement learning (RL) stage for further ranking ability enhancement.
During the RL stage, based on the nature of listwise ranking, we design a
multi-view ranking reward, which is more effective than a ranking metric-based
reward. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our trained reasoning-intensive
reranker \textbf{ReasonRank} outperforms existing baselines significantly and
also achieves much lower latency than pointwise reranker Rank1. \textbf{Through
further experiments, our ReasonRank has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance 40.6 on the BRIGHT
leaderboard\footnote{https://brightbenchmark.github.io/}.} Our codes are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在序列推荐任务中仍依赖自然语言处理的解码策略，导致文本生成目标与推荐下一项选择目标不匹配。

Method: 提出USD框架，将具有相似logit向量的项目聚类为语义等价组，重新分配概率质量，并通过计算熵控制评分和采样温度。

Result: 在Amazon Product数据集上，HR@3、NDCG@3和MRR@3分别提升18.5%、11.9%和10.8%。

Conclusion: 结合语义聚类和不确定性评估，能生成更可靠和准确的推荐。

Abstract: Large language models have been widely applied to sequential recommendation
tasks, yet during inference, they continue to rely on decoding strategies
developed for natural language processing. This creates a mismatch between
text-generation objectives and recommendation next item selection objectives.
This paper addresses this limitation by proposing an Uncertainty-aware Semantic
Decoding (USD) framework that combines logit-based clustering with adaptive
scoring to improve next-item predictions. Our approach clusters items with
similar logit vectors into semantic equivalence groups, then redistributes
probability mass within these clusters and computes entropy across them to
control item scoring and sampling temperature during recommendation inference.
Experiments on Amazon Product datasets (six domains) gains of 18.5\% in HR@3,
11.9\% in NDCG@3, and 10.8\% in MRR@3 compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
Hyperparameter analysis confirms the optimal parameters among various settings,
and experiments on H\&M, and Netflix datasets indicate that the framework can
adapt to differing recommendation domains. The experimental results confirm
that integrating semantic clustering and uncertainty assessment yields more
reliable and accurate recommendations.

Motivation: 解决LLM生成知识中的幻觉、冗余和同质化问题，避免直接使用导致推荐性能下降。

Result: 实验验证了知识过滤和对齐模块的必要性，以及仅提取器训练策略的高效性。

Conclusion: KSER框架有效解决了LLM知识在推荐系统中的问题，提升了推荐性能。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in leveraging the impressive
generalization capabilities and reasoning ability of large language models
(LLMs) to improve the performance of recommenders. With this operation,
recommenders can access and learn the additional world knowledge and reasoning
information via LLMs. However, in general, for different users and items, the
world knowledge derived from LLMs suffers from issues of hallucination, content
redundant, and information homogenization. Directly feeding the generated
response embeddings into the recommendation model can lead to unavoidable
performance deterioration. To address these challenges, we propose a Knowledge
Selection \& Exploitation Recommendation (KSER) framework, which effectively
select and extracts the high-quality knowledge from LLMs. The framework
consists of two key components: a knowledge filtering module and a embedding
spaces alignment module. In the knowledge filtering module, a Embedding
Selection Filter Network (ESFNet) is designed to assign adaptive weights to
different knowledge chunks in different knowledge fields. In the space
alignment module, an attention-based architecture is proposed to align the
semantic embeddings from LLMs with the feature space used to train the
recommendation models. In addition, two training
strategies--\textbf{all-parameters training} and \textbf{extractor-only
training}--are proposed to flexibly adapt to different downstream tasks and
application scenarios, where the extractor-only training strategy offers a
novel perspective on knowledge-augmented recommendation. Experimental results
validate the necessity and effectiveness of both the knowledge filtering and
alignment modules, and further demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of
the extractor-only training strategy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推荐系统中冷启动物品因缺乏交互历史而难以个性化分发的问题。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段利用创作者社交连接进行初始曝光；第二阶段基于早期交互信号和用户嵌入，通过KNN搜索扩展分发。

Result: 在大型视频平台上，SocRipple将冷启动物品分发提升了36%，同时保持了用户参与率。

Conclusion: SocRipple有效平衡了新物品曝光和个性化推荐，解决了冷启动问题。

Abstract: Most industry scale recommender systems face critical cold start challenges
new items lack interaction history, making it difficult to distribute them in a
personalized manner. Standard collaborative filtering models underperform due
to sparse engagement signals, while content only approaches lack user specific
relevance. We propose SocRipple, a novel two stage retrieval framework tailored
for coldstart item distribution in social graph based platforms. Stage 1
leverages the creators social connections for targeted initial exposure. Stage
2 builds on early engagement signals and stable user embeddings learned from
historical interactions to "ripple" outwards via K Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
search. Large scale experiments on a major video platform show that SocRipple
boosts cold start item distribution by +36% while maintaining user engagement
rate on cold start items, effectively balancing new item exposure with
personalized recommendations.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖大语言模型隐式整合检索内容，对检索质量敏感且可能生成与用户偏好不符的响应。

Method: PrLM利用对比训练的个人化奖励模型，指导LLM显式推理用户配置文件，无需标注推理路径。

Result: 在三个个性化文本生成数据集上，PrLM优于现有方法，且对不同检索器和检索配置文件数量具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PrLM通过强化学习框架显式推理用户偏好，显著提升个性化生成效果。

Abstract: Personalized retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) aims to produce
user-tailored responses by incorporating retrieved user profiles alongside the
input query. Existing methods primarily focus on improving retrieval and rely
on large language models (LLMs) to implicitly integrate the retrieved context
with the query. However, such models are often sensitive to retrieval quality
and may generate responses that are misaligned with user preferences. To
address this limitation, we propose PrLM, a reinforcement learning framework
that trains LLMs to explicitly reason over retrieved user profiles. Guided by a
contrastively trained personalization reward model, PrLM effectively learns
from user responses without requiring annotated reasoning paths. Experiments on
three personalized text generation datasets show that PrLM outperforms existing
methods and remains robust across varying numbers of retrieved profiles and
different retrievers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态推荐（MMRec）已成为主流，但其假设（多模态嵌入能提升推荐性能）缺乏全面验证，本文旨在填补这一研究空白。

Method: 采用模态剔除策略（将嵌入设为常量或随机噪声），评估14种先进MMRec模型，分析多模态嵌入整体及单独文本/图像模态的效果。

Result: 多模态嵌入整体提升推荐性能，尤其是通过图融合模型；文本模态单独效果接近完整多模态，图像模态单独效果较差。

Conclusion: 研究为MMRec社区提供了基础性见解和实践指导，并公开代码和数据集以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Multimodal recommendation (MMRec) has emerged as a mainstream paradigm,
typically leveraging text and visual embeddings extracted from pre-trained
models such as Sentence-BERT, Vision Transformers, and ResNet. This approach is
founded on the intuitive assumption that incorporating multimodal embeddings
can enhance recommendation performance. However, despite its popularity, this
assumption lacks comprehensive empirical verification. This presents a critical
research gap. To address it, we pose the central research question of this
paper: Are multimodal embeddings truly beneficial for recommendation? To answer
this question, we conduct a large-scale empirical study examining the role of
text and visual embeddings in modern MMRec models, both as a whole and
individually. Specifically, we pose two key research questions: (1) Do
multimodal embeddings as a whole improve recommendation performance? (2) Is
each individual modality - text and image - useful when used alone? To isolate
the effect of individual modalities - text or visual - we employ a modality
knockout strategy by setting the corresponding embeddings to either constant
values or random noise. To ensure the scale and comprehensiveness of our study,
we evaluate 14 widely used state-of-the-art MMRec models. Our findings reveal
that: (1) multimodal embeddings generally enhance recommendation performance -
particularly when integrated through more sophisticated graph-based fusion
models. Surprisingly, commonly adopted baseline models with simple fusion
schemes, such as VBPR and BM3, show only limited gains. (2) The text modality
alone achieves performance comparable to the full multimodal setting in most
cases, whereas the image modality alone does not. These results offer
foundational insights and practical guidance for the MMRec community. We will
release our code and datasets to facilitate future research.

Abstract: The instability of embedding spaces across model retraining cycles presents
significant challenges to downstream applications using user or item embeddings
derived from recommendation systems as input features. This paper introduces a
novel orthogonal low-rank transformation methodology designed to stabilize the
user/item embedding space, ensuring consistent embedding dimensions across
retraining sessions. Our approach leverages a combination of efficient low-rank
singular value decomposition and orthogonal Procrustes transformation to map
embeddings into a standardized space. This transformation is computationally
efficient, lossless, and lightweight, preserving the dot product and inference
quality while reducing operational burdens. Unlike existing methods that modify
training objectives or embedding structures, our approach maintains the
integrity of the primary model application and can be seamlessly integrated
with other stabilization techniques.

Motivation: 传统推荐方法在捕捉用户偏好语义方面不足，LLM方法需解决推荐对齐问题。

Method: 预训练LLM对齐推荐目标，设计奖励模型评估理由质量，通过RL微调LLM并整合至推荐模型。

Result: 在公开基准测试中，CURec表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CURec有效弥补语义-协作鸿沟，提升推荐系统的可理解性与性能。

Abstract: Recommender systems have become increasingly ubiquitous in daily life. While
traditional recommendation approaches primarily rely on ID-based
representations or item-side content features, they often fall short in
capturing the underlying semantics aligned with user preferences (e.g.,
recommendation reasons for items), leading to a semantic-collaborative gap.
Recently emerged LLM-based feature extraction approaches also face a key
challenge: how to ensure that LLMs possess recommendation-aligned reasoning
capabilities and can generate accurate, personalized reasons to mitigate the
semantic-collaborative gap. To address these issues, we propose a novel Content
Understanding from a Collaborative Perspective framework (CURec), which
generates collaborative-aligned content features for more comprehensive
recommendations. \method first aligns the LLM with recommendation objectives
through pretraining, equipping it with instruction-following and
chain-of-thought reasoning capabilities. Next, we design a reward model
inspired by traditional recommendation architectures to evaluate the quality of
the recommendation reasons generated by the LLM. Finally, using the reward
signals, CURec fine-tunes the LLM through RL and corrects the generated reasons
to ensure their accuracy. The corrected reasons are then integrated into a
downstream recommender model to enhance comprehensibility and recommendation
performance. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate the
superiority of CURec over existing methods.

Conclusion: UMRE无需手动调优，保持排序一致性，并实现细粒度个性化，显著优于传统方法。

Abstract: Industrial recommender systems commonly rely on ensemble sorting (ES) to
combine predictions from multiple behavioral objectives. Traditionally, this
process depends on manually designed nonlinear transformations (e.g.,
polynomial or exponential functions) and hand-tuned fusion weights to balance
competing goals -- an approach that is labor-intensive and frequently
suboptimal in achieving Pareto efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel
Unified Monotonic Ranking Ensemble (UMRE) framework to address the limitations
of traditional methods in ensemble sorting. UMRE replaces handcrafted
transformations with Unconstrained Monotonic Neural Networks (UMNN), which
learn expressive, strictly monotonic functions through the integration of
positive neural integrals. Subsequently, a lightweight ranking model is
employed to fuse the prediction scores, assigning personalized weights to each
prediction objective. To balance competing goals, we further introduce a Pareto
optimality strategy that adaptively coordinates task weights during training.
UMRE eliminates manual tuning, maintains ranking consistency, and achieves
fine-grained personalization. Experimental results on two public recommendation
datasets (Kuairand and Tenrec) and online A/B tests demonstrate impressive
performance and generalization capabilities.

Result: 该方法在RecSys Challenge 2025中帮助团队获得第二名，证明了其在多样化下游任务中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出的通用用户行为表示方法有效且高效，适用于多种预测任务。

Abstract: Building universal user representations that capture the essential aspects of
user behavior is a crucial task for modern machine learning systems. In
real-world applications, a user's historical interactions often serve as the
foundation for solving a wide range of predictive tasks, such as churn
prediction, recommendations, or lifetime value estimation. Using a
task-independent user representation that is effective across all such tasks
can reduce the need for task-specific feature engineering and model retraining,
leading to more scalable and efficient machine learning pipelines. The goal of
the RecSys Challenge 2025 by Synerise was to develop such Universal Behavioral
Profiles from logs of past user behavior, which included various types of
events such as product purchases, page views, and search queries. We propose a
method that transforms the entire user interaction history into a single
chronological sequence and trains a GRU-based autoencoder to reconstruct this
sequence from a fixed-size vector. If the model can accurately reconstruct the
sequence, the latent vector is expected to capture the key behavioral patterns.
In addition to this core model, we explored several alternative methods for
generating user embeddings and combined them by concatenating their output
vectors into a unified representation. This ensemble strategy further improved
generalization across diverse downstream tasks and helped our team,
ai_lab_recsys, achieve second place in the RecSys Challenge 2025.

Motivation: 现代推荐系统中冷用户和冷项目的过滤阈值通常随意选择且差异大，导致评估结果不一致。

Result: 发现不一致的阈值选择会导致有价值数据被移除或将冷实例误分类为热实例，增加系统噪声。

Conclusion: 冷启动阈值的选取需要更系统化，以提高推荐系统的评估可靠性。

Abstract: In modern recommender systems, experimental settings typically include
filtering out cold users and items based on a minimum interaction threshold.
However, these thresholds are often chosen arbitrarily and vary widely across
studies, leading to inconsistencies that can significantly affect the
comparability and reliability of evaluation results. In this paper, we
systematically explore the cold-start boundary by examining the criteria used
to determine whether a user or an item should be considered cold. Our
experiments incrementally vary the number of interactions for different items
during training, and gradually update the length of user interaction histories
during inference. We investigate the thresholds across several widely used
datasets, commonly represented in recent papers from top-tier conferences, and
on multiple established recommender baselines. Our findings show that
inconsistent selection of cold-start thresholds can either result in the
unnecessary removal of valuable data or lead to the misclassification of cold
instances as warm, introducing more noise into the system.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating up-to-date external knowledge, yet real-world web environments
present unique challenges. These limitations manifest as two key challenges:
pervasive misinformation in the web environment, which introduces unreliable or
misleading content that can degrade retrieval accuracy, and the
underutilization of web tools, which, if effectively employed, could enhance
query precision and help mitigate this noise, ultimately improving the
retrieval results in RAG systems. To address these issues, we propose
WebFilter, a novel RAG framework that generates source-restricted queries and
filters out unreliable content. This approach combines a retrieval filtering
mechanism with a behavior- and outcome-driven reward strategy, optimizing both
query formulation and retrieval outcomes. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that WebFilter improves answer quality and retrieval precision, outperforming
existing RAG methods on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的多负排名损失方法，用于训练密集检索模型，以提高模型在语义相似查询下检索文档的一致性。实验表明，该方法降低了模型的敏感性并提高了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的密集检索模型对查询和文档词汇敏感，微小的变化可能导致检索结果显著不同。本文旨在提高模型在语义相似查询下的一致性。

Method: 提出了一种改进的多负排名损失，惩罚语义等效查询在检索结果上的不一致性。

Result: 在多个数据集（MS-MARCO、Natural Questions、BEIR、TREC DL 19/20）上的实验表明，优化后的模型敏感性降低且准确性提高。

Conclusion: 改进的损失函数有效提升了密集检索模型的一致性和性能。

Abstract: Dense Retrieval (DR) models have proven to be effective for Document
Retrieval and Information Grounding tasks. Usually, these models are trained
and optimized for improving the relevance of top-ranked documents for a given
query. Previous work has shown that popular DR models are sensitive to the
query and document lexicon: small variations of it may lead to a significant
difference in the set of retrieved documents. In this paper, we propose a
variation of the Multi-Negative Ranking loss for training DR that improves the
coherence of models in retrieving the same documents with respect to
semantically similar queries. The loss penalizes discrepancies between the
top-k ranked documents retrieved for diverse but semantic equivalent queries.
We conducted extensive experiments on various datasets, MS-MARCO, Natural
Questions, BEIR, and TREC DL 19/20. The results show that (i) models optimizes
by our loss are subject to lower sensitivity, and, (ii) interestingly, higher
accuracy.

TL;DR: DIVER是一个针对推理密集型信息检索的检索流程，通过优化输入质量、查询扩展、推理增强检索器和重排序器，显著提升了复杂查询的检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索方法在涉及抽象推理、类比思考或多步推理的查询中表现不佳，DIVER旨在解决这一问题。

Method: DIVER包含四个组件：文档处理、LLM驱动的查询扩展、推理增强检索器和基于LLM的重排序器。

Result: 在BRIGHT基准测试中，DIVER取得了41.6和28.9的nDCG@10分数，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: DIVER证明了推理感知检索策略在复杂任务中的有效性，代码和模型即将发布。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation has achieved strong performance on
knowledge-intensive tasks where query-document relevance can be identified
through direct lexical or semantic matches. However, many real-world queries
involve abstract reasoning, analogical thinking, or multi-step inference, which
existing retrievers often struggle to capture. To address this challenge, we
present \textbf{DIVER}, a retrieval pipeline tailored for reasoning-intensive
information retrieval. DIVER consists of four components: document processing
to improve input quality, LLM-driven query expansion via iterative document
interaction, a reasoning-enhanced retriever fine-tuned on synthetic
multi-domain data with hard negatives, and a pointwise reranker that combines
LLM-assigned helpfulness scores with retrieval scores. On the BRIGHT benchmark,
DIVER achieves state-of-the-art nDCG@10 scores of 41.6 and 28.9 on original
queries, consistently outperforming competitive reasoning-aware models. These
results demonstrate the effectiveness of reasoning-aware retrieval strategies
in complex real-world tasks. Our code and retrieval model will be released
soon.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MAMEX的混合专家框架，用于多模态冷启动推荐，通过动态利用不同模态的潜在表示，显著提升了推荐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决冷启动场景下新物品推荐问题，现有方法在多模态数据整合上过于简单，无法捕捉模态间复杂关系。

Method: 采用模态特定专家网络和可学习的门控机制，动态加权各模态贡献，强调信息量最大的模态。

Result: 在基准数据集上，MAMEX在冷启动场景中优于现有方法，具有更高的准确性和适应性。

Conclusion: MAMEX通过动态模态整合有效解决了冷启动问题，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recommendation systems have faced significant challenges in cold-start
scenarios, where new items with a limited history of interaction need to be
effectively recommended to users. Though multimodal data (e.g., images, text,
audio, etc.) offer rich information to address this issue, existing approaches
often employ simplistic integration methods such as concatenation, average
pooling, or fixed weighting schemes, which fail to capture the complex
relationships between modalities. Our study proposes a novel Mixture of Experts
(MoE) framework for multimodal cold-start recommendation, named MAMEX, which
dynamically leverages latent representation from different modalities. MAMEX
utilizes modality-specific expert networks and introduces a learnable gating
mechanism that adaptively weights the contribution of each modality based on
its content characteristics. This approach enables MAMEX to emphasize the most
informative modalities for each item while maintaining robustness when certain
modalities are less relevant or missing. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets show that MAMEX outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cold-start
scenarios, with superior accuracy and adaptability. For reproducibility, the
code has been made available on Github https://github.com/L2R-UET/MAMEX.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业需要同时利用本地和网络语料库的私有深度搜索系统，现有方法局限于单一知识源且训练效率低。

Method: 采用分层强化学习，低层训练本地和网络搜索代理，高层规划代理协调并整合结果，设计知识精炼器过滤错误信息。

Result: 在六个基准测试中优于平面强化学习和多源检索增强生成基线。

Conclusion: HierSearch在多源深度搜索任务中表现优异，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Recently, large reasoning models have demonstrated strong mathematical and
coding abilities, and deep search leverages their reasoning capabilities in
challenging information retrieval tasks. Existing deep search works are
generally limited to a single knowledge source, either local or the Web.
However, enterprises often require private deep search systems that can
leverage search tools over both local and the Web corpus. Simply training an
agent equipped with multiple search tools using flat reinforcement learning
(RL) is a straightforward idea, but it has problems such as low training data
efficiency and poor mastery of complex tools. To address the above issue, we
propose a hierarchical agentic deep search framework, HierSearch, trained with
hierarchical RL. At the low level, a local deep search agent and a Web deep
search agent are trained to retrieve evidence from their corresponding domains.
At the high level, a planner agent coordinates low-level agents and provides
the final answer. Moreover, to prevent direct answer copying and error
propagation, we design a knowledge refiner that filters out hallucinations and
irrelevant evidence returned by low-level agents. Experiments show that
HierSearch achieves better performance compared to flat RL, and outperforms
various deep search and multi-source retrieval-augmented generation baselines
in six benchmarks across general, finance, and medical domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的生存模型理论（SOSM），将生存视为生物状态空间几何特性的自然结果，而非依赖标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生存模型依赖标注数据和固定协变量，而本文认为生存是生物状态空间几何特性的自然结果，试图建立一种不依赖标注的通用模型。

Method: 提出自组织生存流形（SOSM）理论，基于低曲率测地流和生物约束构建生存能量泛函，推导离散和连续目标函数。

Result: 理论证明在生物合理条件下，生存对齐的轨迹会自然涌现并收敛，生存与几何流稳定性相关。

Conclusion: 该理论为生存建模提供了无标注的通用框架，将健康、疾病、衰老和死亡视为流形结构的几何相变。

Abstract: Survival is traditionally modeled as a supervised learning task, reliant on
curated outcome labels and fixed covariates. This work rejects that premise. It
proposes that survival is not an externally annotated target but a geometric
consequence: an emergent property of the curvature and flow inherent in
biological state space. We develop a theory of Self-Organizing Survival
Manifolds (SOSM), in which survival-relevant dynamics arise from low-curvature
geodesic flows on latent manifolds shaped by internal biological constraints. A
survival energy functional based on geodesic curvature minimization is
introduced and shown to induce structures where prognosis aligns with geometric
flow stability. We derive discrete and continuous formulations of the objective
and prove theoretical results demonstrating the emergence and convergence of
survival-aligned trajectories under biologically plausible conditions. The
framework draws connections to thermodynamic efficiency, entropy flow, Ricci
curvature, and optimal transport, grounding survival modeling in physical law.
Health, disease, aging, and death are reframed as geometric phase transitions
in the manifold's structure. This theory offers a universal, label-free
foundation for modeling survival as a property of form, not annotation-bridging
machine learning, biophysics, and the geometry of life itself.

Motivation: 现代供应链欺诈检测面临全球网络复杂性和标记数据稀缺的挑战，传统方法因类别不平衡和有限监督而效果不佳。

Method: 第一阶段使用Isolation Forest算法进行无监督异常检测；第二阶段通过自训练SVM结合标记和高置信度伪标记样本进行半监督学习。

Result: 在DataCo供应链数据集上，F1-score达到0.817，假阳性率低于3.0%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效结合无监督预过滤和半监督细化，但需注意概念漂移问题，并与深度学习方法进一步比较。

Abstract: Detecting fraud in modern supply chains is a growing challenge, driven by the
complexity of global networks and the scarcity of labeled data. Traditional
detection methods often struggle with class imbalance and limited supervision,
reducing their effectiveness in real-world applications. This paper proposes a
novel two-phase learning framework to address these challenges. In the first
phase, the Isolation Forest algorithm performs unsupervised anomaly detection
to identify potential fraud cases and reduce the volume of data requiring
further analysis. In the second phase, a self-training Support Vector Machine
(SVM) refines the predictions using both labeled and high-confidence
pseudo-labeled samples, enabling robust semi-supervised learning. The proposed
method is evaluated on the DataCo Smart Supply Chain Dataset, a comprehensive
real-world supply chain dataset with fraud indicators. It achieves an F1-score
of 0.817 while maintaining a false positive rate below 3.0%. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of combining unsupervised
pre-filtering with semi-supervised refinement for supply chain fraud detection
under real-world constraints, though we acknowledge limitations regarding
concept drift and the need for comparison with deep learning approaches.

Abstract: Drug-drug interactions pose a significant challenge in clinical pharmacology,
with severe class imbalance among interaction types limiting the effectiveness
of predictive models. Common interactions dominate datasets, while rare but
critical interactions remain underrepresented, leading to poor model
performance on infrequent cases. Existing methods often treat DDI prediction as
a binary problem, ignoring class-specific nuances and exacerbating bias toward
frequent interactions. To address this, we propose a framework combining
Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNet) with Variational Graph Autoencoders (VGAE)
to generate synthetic samples for rare classes, improving model balance and
generate effective and novel DDI pairs. Our approach enhances predictive
performance across interaction types, ensuring better clinical reliability.

Result: 在新数据集和基准数据集上表现优于现有GNN方法。

Conclusion: HGMN能有效融合角色特征和邻接信息，为图学习提供强大工具。

Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained significant
attention for node classification tasks on graph-structured data. However,
traditional GNNs primarily focus on adjacency relationships between nodes,
often overlooking the rich role-based characteristics that are crucial for
learning more expressive node representations. Existing methods for capturing
role-based features are largely unsupervised and fail to achieve optimal
performance in downstream tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel hypergraph neural network with state space model (HGMN) that effectively
integrates role-aware representations into GNNs and the state space model. HGMN
utilizes hypergraph construction techniques to model higher-order relationships
and combines role-based and adjacency-based representations through a learnable
mamba transformer mechanism. By leveraging two distinct hypergraph construction
methods-based on node degree and neighborhood levels, it strengthens the
connections among nodes with similar roles, enhancing the model's
representational power. Additionally, the inclusion of hypergraph convolution
layers enables the model to capture complex dependencies within hypergraph
structures. To mitigate the over-smoothing problem inherent in deep GNNs, we
incorporate a residual network, ensuring improved stability and better feature
propagation across layers. Extensive experiments conducted on one newly
introduced dataset and four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of
HGMN. The model achieves significant performance improvements on node
classification tasks compared to state-of-the-art GNN methods. These results
highlight HGMN's ability to provide enriched node representations by
effectively embedding role-based features alongside adjacency information,
making it a versatile and powerful tool for a variety of graph-based learning
applications.

Result: RGVQ显著提高了代码本利用率，并在多个下游任务中提升了性能。

Conclusion: RGVQ为图数据VQ提供了更表达和可迁移的令牌表示。

Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) has recently emerged as a promising approach for
learning discrete representations of graph-structured data. However, a
fundamental challenge, i.e., codebook collapse, remains underexplored in the
graph domain, significantly limiting the expressiveness and generalization of
graph tokens.In this paper, we present the first empirical study showing that
codebook collapse consistently occurs when applying VQ to graph data, even with
mitigation strategies proposed in vision or language domains. To understand why
graph VQ is particularly vulnerable to collapse, we provide a theoretical
analysis and identify two key factors: early assignment imbalances caused by
redundancy in graph features and structural patterns, and self-reinforcing
optimization loops in deterministic VQ. To address these issues, we propose
RGVQ, a novel framework that integrates graph topology and feature similarity
as explicit regularization signals to enhance codebook utilization and promote
token diversity. RGVQ introduces soft assignments via Gumbel-Softmax
reparameterization, ensuring that all codewords receive gradient updates. In
addition, RGVQ incorporates a structure-aware contrastive regularization to
penalize the token co-assignments among similar node pairs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that RGVQ substantially improves codebook utilization
and consistently boosts the performance of state-of-the-art graph VQ backbones
across multiple downstream tasks, enabling more expressive and transferable
graph token representations.

Abstract: Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems play a crucial role in analyzing
neuroimaging data for neurological and psychiatric disorders. However,
small-sample studies suffer from low reproducibility, while large-scale
datasets introduce confounding heterogeneity due to multiple disease subtypes
being labeled under a single category. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel federated learning framework tailored for neuroimaging CAD systems. Our
approach includes a dynamic navigation module that routes samples to the most
suitable local models based on latent subtype representations, and a
meta-integration module that combines predictions from heterogeneous local
models into a unified diagnostic output. We evaluated our framework using a
comprehensive dataset comprising fMRI data from over 1300 MDD patients and 1100
healthy controls across multiple study cohorts. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy and robustness
compared to traditional methods. Specifically, our framework achieved an
average accuracy of 74.06\% across all tested sites, showcasing its
effectiveness in handling subtype heterogeneity and enhancing model
generalizability. Ablation studies further confirmed the importance of both the
dynamic navigation and meta-integration modules in improving performance. By
addressing data heterogeneity and subtype confounding, our framework advances
reliable and reproducible neuroimaging CAD systems, offering significant
potential for personalized medicine and clinical decision-making in neurology
and psychiatry.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have reshaped the research landscape by enabling
new approaches to knowledge retrieval and creative ideation. Yet their
application in discipline-specific experimental science, particularly in highly
multi-disciplinary domains like materials science, remains limited. We present
a first-of-its-kind framework that integrates generative AI with literature
from hitherto-unconnected fields such as plant science, biomimetics, and
materials engineering to extract insights and design experiments for materials.
We focus on humidity-responsive systems such as pollen-based materials and
Rhapis excelsa (broadleaf lady palm) leaves, which exhibit self-actuation and
adaptive performance. Using a suite of AI tools, including a fine-tuned model
(BioinspiredLLM), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), agentic systems, and a
Hierarchical Sampling strategy, we extract structure-property relationships and
translate them into new classes of bioinspired materials. Structured inference
protocols generate and evaluate hundreds of hypotheses from a single query,
surfacing novel and experimentally tractable ideas. We validate our approach
through real-world implementation: LLM-generated procedures, materials designs,
and mechanical predictions were tested in the laboratory, culminating in the
fabrication of a novel pollen-based adhesive with tunable morphology and
measured shear strength, establishing a foundation for future plant-derived
adhesive design. This work demonstrates how AI-assisted ideation can drive
real-world materials design and enable effective human-AI collaboration.

Conclusion: 预训练数据过滤是开放权重AI系统的一种有效防护层，但仍需结合其他防御措施。

Abstract: Open-weight AI systems offer unique benefits, including enhanced
transparency, open research, and decentralized access. However, they are
vulnerable to tampering attacks which can efficiently elicit harmful behaviors
by modifying weights or activations. Currently, there is not yet a robust
science of open-weight model risk management. Existing safety fine-tuning
methods and other post-training techniques have struggled to make LLMs
resistant to more than a few dozen steps of adversarial fine-tuning. In this
paper, we investigate whether filtering text about dual-use topics from
training data can prevent unwanted capabilities and serve as a more
tamper-resistant safeguard. We introduce a multi-stage pipeline for scalable
data filtering and show that it offers a tractable and effective method for
minimizing biothreat proxy knowledge in LLMs. We pretrain multiple
6.9B-parameter models from scratch and find that they exhibit substantial
resistance to adversarial fine-tuning attacks on up to 10,000 steps and 300M
tokens of biothreat-related text -- outperforming existing post-training
baselines by over an order of magnitude -- with no observed degradation to
unrelated capabilities. However, while filtered models lack internalized
dangerous knowledge, we find that they can still leverage such information when
it is provided in context (e.g., via search tool augmentation), demonstrating a
need for a defense-in-depth approach. Overall, these findings help to establish
pretraining data curation as a promising layer of defense for open-weight AI
systems.

Motivation: 传统符号回归（SR）仅能估计目标变量的平均值，而无法描述变量在其他分位数（如中位数或极端值）上的关系。SQR旨在填补这一空白，为高风险的、安全关键的应用领域提供更全面的预测。

Conclusion: SQR适用于预测条件分位数，并能帮助理解不同分位数下特征的影响。

Abstract: Symbolic Regression (SR) is a well-established framework for generating
interpretable or white-box predictive models. Although SR has been successfully
applied to create interpretable estimates of the average of the outcome, it is
currently not well understood how it can be used to estimate the relationship
between variables at other points in the distribution of the target variable.
Such estimates of e.g. the median or an extreme value provide a fuller picture
of how predictive variables affect the outcome and are necessary in
high-stakes, safety-critical application domains. This study introduces
Symbolic Quantile Regression (SQR), an approach to predict conditional
quantiles with SR. In an extensive evaluation, we find that SQR outperforms
transparent models and performs comparably to a strong black-box baseline
without compromising transparency. We also show how SQR can be used to explain
differences in the target distribution by comparing models that predict extreme
and central outcomes in an airline fuel usage case study. We conclude that SQR
is suitable for predicting conditional quantiles and understanding interesting
feature influences at varying quantiles.

Result: 实验验证了不同参数对博弈结果的影响，展示了激励机制的有效性。

Conclusion: 令牌机制成功平衡了隐私与准确性，为联邦学习中的激励机制设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: In Federated Learning (FL), multiple clients jointly train a machine learning
model by sharing gradient information, instead of raw data, with a server over
multiple rounds. To address the possibility of information leakage in spite of
sharing only the gradients, Local Differential Privacy (LDP) is often used. In
LDP, clients add a selective amount of noise to the gradients before sending
the same to the server. Although such noise addition protects the privacy of
clients, it leads to a degradation in global model accuracy. In this paper, we
model this privacy-accuracy trade-off as a game, where the sever incentivizes
the clients to add a lower degree of noise for achieving higher accuracy, while
the clients attempt to preserve their privacy at the cost of a potential loss
in accuracy. A token based incentivization mechanism is introduced in which the
quantum of tokens credited to a client in an FL round is a function of the
degree of perturbation of its gradients. The client can later access a newly
updated global model only after acquiring enough tokens, which are to be
deducted from its balance. We identify the players, their actions and payoff,
and perform a strategic analysis of the game. Extensive experiments were
carried out to study the impact of different parameters.

Abstract: As a class of generative artificial intelligence frameworks inspired by
statistical physics, diffusion models have shown extraordinary performance in
synthesizing complicated data distributions through a denoising process
gradually guided by score functions. Real-life data, like images, is often
spatially structured in low-dimensional spaces. However, ordinary diffusion
models ignore this local structure and learn spatially global score functions,
which are often computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce a new
perspective on the phases of data distributions, which provides insight into
constructing local denoisers with reduced computational costs. We define two
distributions as belonging to the same data distribution phase if they can be
mutually connected via spatially local operations such as local denoisers.
Then, we show that the reverse denoising process consists of an early trivial
phase and a late data phase, sandwiching a rapid phase transition where local
denoisers must fail. To diagnose such phase transitions, we prove an
information-theoretic bound on the fidelity of local denoisers based on
conditional mutual information, and conduct numerical experiments in a
real-world dataset. This work suggests simpler and more efficient architectures
of diffusion models: far from the phase transition point, we can use small
local neural networks to compute the score function; global neural networks are
only necessary around the narrow time interval of phase transitions. This
result also opens up new directions for studying phases of data distributions,
the broader science of generative artificial intelligence, and guiding the
design of neural networks inspired by physics concepts.

### [452] [Multi-Hop Privacy Propagation for Differentially Private Federated Learning in Social Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07676)
*Chenchen Lin,Xuehe Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种社交感知的隐私保护联邦学习机制，通过多跳传播模型量化间接隐私泄露，并采用Stackelberg博弈优化激励策略和隐私预算选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）在保护隐私的同时促进协作，但社交网络中的多跳交互会引入隐私外部性，即隐私损失不仅取决于自身策略，还受他人决策影响。

Method: 提出一种两阶段Stackelberg博弈框架，服务器优化激励策略，客户端选择隐私预算；引入均值场估计器近似平均外部隐私风险。

Result: 理论证明了均值场估计器的固定点存在性和收敛性，并推导了Stackelberg纳什均衡的闭式解。实验表明该方法显著提升客户端效用并降低服务器成本。

Conclusion: 该机制在客户端激励视角下设计，实现了近似最优的社会福利，优于社交无关基线和其他考虑社交外部性的方法。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized clients without sharing local data, thereby enhancing privacy and
facilitating collaboration among clients connected via social networks.
However, these social connections introduce privacy externalities: a client's
privacy loss depends not only on its privacy protection strategy but also on
the privacy decisions of others, propagated through the network via multi-hop
interactions. In this work, we propose a socially-aware privacy-preserving FL
mechanism that systematically quantifies indirect privacy leakage through a
multi-hop propagation model. We formulate the server-client interaction as a
two-stage Stackelberg game, where the server, as the leader, optimizes
incentive policies, and clients, as followers, strategically select their
privacy budgets, which determine their privacy-preserving levels by controlling
the magnitude of added noise. To mitigate information asymmetry in networked
privacy estimation, we introduce a mean-field estimator to approximate the
average external privacy risk. We theoretically prove the existence and
convergence of the fixed point of the mean-field estimator and derive
closed-form expressions for the Stackelberg Nash Equilibrium. Despite being
designed from a client-centric incentive perspective, our mechanism achieves
approximately-optimal social welfare, as revealed by Price of Anarchy (PoA)
analysis. Experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves client utilities and reduces server costs while
maintaining model performance, outperforming both Social-Agnostic (SA)
baselines and methods that account for social externalities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种适用于密集和稀疏大型语言模型的通用扩展法则，以解决现有扩展法则的架构特定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型规模和训练成本的指数增长，优化模型大小和资源分配仍具挑战性，现有扩展法则多为架构特定。

Method: 重新审视现有扩展法则，提出一种通用扩展法则，适用于密集和稀疏模型，并通过评估验证其有效性。

Result: 提出的通用扩展法则在密集和稀疏模型中均表现出有效性。

Conclusion: 通用扩展法则为大型语言模型的训练提供了统一的优化框架。

Abstract: Over the past few years, the size of language models has grown exponentially,
as has the computational cost to train these large models. This rapid growth
has motivated researchers to develop new techniques aimed at enhancing the
efficiency of the training process. Despite these advancements, optimally
predicting the model size or allocating optimal resources remains a challenge.
Several efforts have addressed the challenge by proposing different scaling
laws, but almost all of them are architecture-specific (dense or sparse). In
this work we revisit existing scaling laws and propose a generalized scaling
law to provide a unified framework that is applicable to both dense and sparse
large language models. We evaluate and compare our proposed scaling law with
existing scaling laws to demonstrate its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ANTIDOTE是一种针对噪声标签学习的新目标函数，通过信息散度邻域的松弛定义，并利用凸对偶性转化为对抗训练方法，计算成本接近标准交叉熵损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决训练数据中固有或由对手引入的噪声标签问题，提升模型在噪声环境下的鲁棒性。

Method: 通过信息散度邻域的松弛定义目标函数，利用凸对偶性转化为对抗训练方法，自适应减少噪声标签样本的影响。

Result: 在不同类型噪声（对称、非对称、人工标注和真实噪声）下表现优异，计算效率接近标准交叉熵损失。

Conclusion: ANTIDOTE在噪声标签学习中表现优越，计算高效，适用于实际噪声环境。

Abstract: We introduce ANTIDOTE, a new class of objectives for learning under noisy
labels which are defined in terms of a relaxation over an
information-divergence neighborhood. Using convex duality, we provide a
reformulation as an adversarial training method that has similar computational
cost to training with standard cross-entropy loss. We show that our approach
adaptively reduces the influence of the samples with noisy labels during
learning, exhibiting a behavior that is analogous to forgetting those samples.
ANTIDOTE is effective in practical environments where label noise is inherent
in the training data or where an adversary can alter the training labels.
Extensive empirical evaluations on different levels of symmetric, asymmetric,
human annotation, and real-world label noise show that ANTIDOTE outperforms
leading comparable losses in the field and enjoys a time complexity that is
very close to that of the standard cross entropy loss.

Result: 在4700名患者数据集上，AUC提升6.5%至15.5%，并识别出与PDAC风险相关的诊断代码和实验室指标。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升PDAC早期检测性能，并发现新生物标志物，具有临床潜力。

Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest cancers, and
early detection remains a major clinical challenge due to the absence of
specific symptoms and reliable biomarkers. In this work, we propose a new
multimodal approach that integrates longitudinal diagnosis code histories and
routinely collected laboratory measurements from electronic health records to
detect PDAC up to one year prior to clinical diagnosis. Our method combines
neural controlled differential equations to model irregular lab time series,
pretrained language models and recurrent networks to learn diagnosis code
trajectory representations, and cross-attention mechanisms to capture
interactions between the two modalities. We develop and evaluate our approach
on a real-world dataset of nearly 4,700 patients and achieve significant
improvements in AUC ranging from 6.5% to 15.5% over state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, our model identifies diagnosis codes and laboratory panels
associated with elevated PDAC risk, including both established and new
biomarkers. Our code is available at

Motivation: 在有限数据条件下，利用大语言模型生成合成数据（如调查响应）的需求日益增长，但如何与真实数据结合并保证统计有效性尚不明确。

Result: 实验验证了该方法在计算社会科学回归任务中的有效性，展示了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法为合成数据与真实数据的结合提供了理论保证和实际性能优势。

Abstract: Predictions and generations from large language models are increasingly being
explored as an aid to computational social science and human subject research
in limited data regimes. While previous technical work has explored the
potential to use model-predicted labels for unlabeled data in a principled
manner, there is increasing interest in using large language models to generate
entirely new synthetic samples (also termed as synthetic simulations), such as
in responses to surveys. However, it is not immediately clear by what means
practitioners can combine such data with real data and yet produce
statistically valid conclusions upon them. In this work, we introduce a new
estimator based on generalized method of moments, providing a
hyperparameter-free solution with strong theoretical guarantees to address the
challenge at hand. Surprisingly, we find that interactions between the moment
residuals of synthetic data and those of real data can improve estimates of the
target parameter. We empirically validate the finite-sample performance of our
estimator across different regression tasks in computational social science
applications, demonstrating large empirical gains.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种自适应阈值框架（SCS和MACS），用于非平稳环境中的时间序列异常检测，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态阈值在非平稳环境中容易失效，需要适应统计特性随时间变化的新方法。

Method: 提出SCS和MACS框架，结合统计在线学习和分段原理，实现局部自适应阈值。

Result: 在Wafer Manufacturing数据集上，F1分数显著优于传统百分位和滚动分位数方法。

Conclusion: 自适应阈值框架能实现可靠、可解释且及时的异常检测，适用于多样化的现实场景。

Abstract: As time series data become increasingly prevalent in domains such as
manufacturing, IT, and infrastructure monitoring, anomaly detection must adapt
to nonstationary environments where statistical properties shift over time.
Traditional static thresholds are easily rendered obsolete by regime shifts,
concept drift, or multi-scale changes. To address these challenges, we
introduce and empirically evaluate two novel adaptive thresholding frameworks:
Segmented Confidence Sequences (SCS) and Multi-Scale Adaptive Confidence
Segments (MACS). Both leverage statistical online learning and segmentation
principles for local, contextually sensitive adaptation, maintaining guarantees
on false alarm rates even under evolving distributions. Our experiments across
Wafer Manufacturing benchmark datasets show significant F1-score improvement
compared to traditional percentile and rolling quantile approaches. This work
demonstrates that robust, statistically principled adaptive thresholds enable
reliable, interpretable, and timely detection of diverse real-world anomalies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的通用序列映射（USM）方法，解决了迭代过程中的种子偏差问题，并揭示了USM作为一种高效数值过程的特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于Transformer的语言模型（如ChatGPT）的兴起，探索多尺度和多维度符号序列的数值编码方法成为研究热点。USM通过混沌游戏表示（CGR）双向编码符号序列，解决了保留符号序列上下文信息的挑战。

Method: USM由正向和反向的混沌游戏表示（CGR）组成，可投影到频域（FCGR），并利用切比雪夫距离和k-mer频率进行计算。改进后的USM解决了种子偏差问题。

Result: 改进后的USM实现了数值定位与序列身份的全匹配，并揭示了USM作为一种高效数值过程的特性，能够收敛到稳态序列嵌入解。

Conclusion: USM不仅适用于基因组序列（4核苷酸字母表），还可轻松扩展到任意基数字母表的应用。

Abstract: Motivation: With the advent of Language Models using Transformers,
popularized by ChatGPT, there is a renewed interest in exploring encoding
procedures that numerically represent symbolic sequences at multiple scales and
embedding dimensions. The challenge that encoding addresses is the need for
mechanisms that uniquely retain contextual information about the succession of
individual symbols, which can then be modeled by nonlinear formulations such as
neural networks.
  Context: Universal Sequence Maps(USM) are iterated functions that bijectively
encode symbolic sequences onto embedded numerical spaces. USM is composed of
two Chaos Game Representations (CGR), iterated forwardly and backwardly, that
can be projected into the frequency domain (FCGR). The corresponding USM
coordinates can be used to compute a Chebyshev distance metric as well as k-mer
frequencies, without having to recompute the embedded numeric coordinates, and,
paradoxically, allowing for non-integers values of k.
  Results: This report advances the bijective fractal encoding by Universal
Sequence Maps (USM) by resolving seeding biases affecting the iterated process.
The resolution had two results, the first expected, the second an intriguing
outcome: 1) full reconciliation of numeric positioning with sequence identity;
and 2) uncovering the nature of USM as an efficient numeric process converging
towards a steady state sequence embedding solution. We illustrate these results
for genomic sequences because of the convenience of a planar representation
defined by an alphabet with only 4 tokens (the 4 nucleotides). Nevertheless,
the application to alphabet of arbitrary cardinality was found to be
straightforward.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation has become essential for securely sharing and

often fail to adequately preserve privacy. We introduce the Tabular
Auto-Regressive Generative Network (TabularARGN), a neural network architecture
specifically designed for generating high-quality synthetic tabular data. Using
a discretization-based auto-regressive approach, TabularARGN achieves high data
fidelity while remaining computationally efficient. We evaluate TabularARGN
against existing synthetic data generation methods, showing competitive results
in statistical similarity, machine learning utility, and detection robustness.
We further perform an in-depth privacy evaluation using systematic
membership-inference attacks, highlighting the robustness and effective
privacy-utility balance of our approach.

Motivation: 强化学习代理在新任务和环境中泛化能力不足，因其表征和策略过度拟合训练环境。

Result: 实验表明，CORAL显著提升样本效率，并在未见过的稀疏奖励环境中实现零样本适应。

Conclusion: 学习可迁移的通信表征能有效提升代理的上下文适应能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) agents often struggle to generalize to new tasks
and contexts without updating their parameters, mainly because their learned
representations and policies are overfit to the specifics of their training
environments. To boost agents' in-context RL (ICRL) ability, this work
formulates ICRL as a two-agent emergent communication problem and introduces
CORAL (Communicative Representation for Adaptive RL), a framework that learns a
transferable communicative context by decoupling latent representation learning
from control. In CORAL, an Information Agent (IA) is pre-trained as a world
model on a diverse distribution of tasks. Its objective is not to maximize task
reward, but to build a world model and distill its understanding into concise
messages. The emergent communication protocol is shaped by a novel Causal
Influence Loss, which measures the effect that the message has on the next
action. During deployment, the previously trained IA serves as a fixed
contextualizer for a new Control Agent (CA), which learns to solve tasks by
interpreting the provided communicative context. Our experiments demonstrate
that this approach enables the CA to achieve significant gains in sample
efficiency and successfully perform zero-shot adaptation with the help of
pre-trained IA in entirely unseen sparse-reward environments, validating the
efficacy of learning a transferable communicative representation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNN在决策应用中可能放大数据偏见，导致不公平行为，现有方法难以高效识别和修正这些偏见。

Method: 通过调整与敏感属性相关的神经元权重，分析输入输出关系以修正导致预测质量差异的神经元。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上，FairFLRep在提升公平性的同时保持准确性，且效率高于基线方法。

Conclusion: FairFLRep在公平性和效率上优于现有方法，证明了在故障定位和修复阶段考虑公平性的重要性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are being utilized in various aspects of our
daily lives, including high-stakes decision-making applications that impact
individuals. However, these systems reflect and amplify bias from the data used
during training and testing, potentially resulting in biased behavior and
inaccurate decisions. For instance, having different misclassification rates
between white and black sub-populations. However, effectively and efficiently
identifying and correcting biased behavior in DNNs is a challenge. This paper
introduces FairFLRep, an automated fairness-aware fault localization and repair
technique that identifies and corrects potentially bias-inducing neurons in DNN
classifiers. FairFLRep focuses on adjusting neuron weights associated with
sensitive attributes, such as race or gender, that contribute to unfair
decisions. By analyzing the input-output relationships within the network,
FairFLRep corrects neurons responsible for disparities in predictive quality
parity. We evaluate FairFLRep on four image classification datasets using two
DNN classifiers, and four tabular datasets with a DNN model. The results show
that FairFLRep consistently outperforms existing methods in improving fairness
while preserving accuracy. An ablation study confirms the importance of
considering fairness during both fault localization and repair stages. Our
findings also show that FairFLRep is more efficient than the baseline
approaches in repairing the network.

Conclusion: KANs能增强GNN表达能力，并实现高效的图无关推理。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown strong performance on
graph-structured data, but their reliance on graph connectivity often limits
scalability and efficiency. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), a recent
architecture with learnable univariate functions, offer strong nonlinear
expressiveness and efficient inference. In this work, we integrate KANs into
three popular GNN architectures-GAT, SGC, and APPNP-resulting in three new
models: KGAT, KSGC, and KAPPNP. We further adopt a multi-teacher knowledge
amalgamation framework, where knowledge from multiple KAN-based GNNs is
distilled into a graph-independent KAN student model. Experiments on benchmark
datasets show that the proposed models improve node classification accuracy,
and the knowledge amalgamation approach significantly boosts student model
performance. Our findings highlight the potential of KANs for enhancing GNN
expressiveness and for enabling efficient, graph-free inference.

Motivation: 随着机器学习中知识产权保护的重要性增加，现有水印方法难以适应KAN的新型架构，因此需要专门的水印技术。

Method: 提出DCT-AW方法，通过离散余弦变换扰动激活输出来嵌入水印，适用于KAN的可学习激活函数。

Result: 实验表明DCT-AW对模型性能影响小，且能抵抗微调、剪枝等攻击。

Conclusion: DCT-AW为KAN提供了一种高效、鲁棒的水印解决方案。

Abstract: With the increasing importance of protecting intellectual property in machine
learning, watermarking techniques have gained significant attention. As
advanced models are increasingly deployed in domains such as social network
analysis, the need for robust model protection becomes even more critical.
While existing watermarking methods have demonstrated effectiveness for
conventional deep neural networks, they often fail to adapt to the novel
architecture, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), which feature learnable
activation functions. KAN holds strong potential for modeling complex
relationships in network-structured data. However, their unique design also
introduces new challenges for watermarking. Therefore, we propose a novel
watermarking method, Discrete Cosine Transform-based Activation Watermarking
(DCT-AW), tailored for KAN. Leveraging the learnable activation functions of
KAN, our method embeds watermarks by perturbing activation outputs using
discrete cosine transform, ensuring compatibility with diverse tasks and
achieving task independence. Experimental results demonstrate that DCT-AW has a
small impact on model performance and provides superior robustness against
various watermark removal attacks, including fine-tuning, pruning, and
retraining after pruning.

Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）常因客户端数据多样性导致训练不稳定，现有方法（如Oort）在后期训练中准确性下降明显。

Method: 提出HeteRo-Select框架，通过评分系统综合考虑客户端有用性、公平性、更新速度和数据多样性，并理论证明其有效性。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，HeteRo-Select的峰值准确率为74.75%，最终准确率为72.76%，稳定性下降仅为1.99%，优于Oort。

Conclusion: HeteRo-Select为实际异构FL问题提供了可靠解决方案，兼具理论支持和实证表现。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning technique that often suffers
from training instability due to the diverse nature of client data. Although
utility-based client selection methods like Oort are used to converge by
prioritizing high-loss clients, they frequently experience significant drops in
accuracy during later stages of training. We propose a theoretical
HeteRo-Select framework designed to maintain high performance and ensure
long-term training stability. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that
when client data is very different (high heterogeneity), choosing a smart
subset of client participation can reduce communication more effectively
compared to full participation. Our HeteRo-Select method uses a clear,
step-by-step scoring system that considers client usefulness, fairness, update
speed, and data variety. It also shows convergence guarantees under strong
regularization. Our experimental results on the CIFAR-10 dataset under
significant label skew ($\alpha=0.1$) support the theoretical findings. The
HeteRo-Select method performs better than existing approaches in terms of peak
accuracy, final accuracy, and training stability. Specifically, HeteRo-Select
achieves a peak accuracy of $74.75\%$, a final accuracy of $72.76\%$, and a
minimal stability drop of $1.99\%$. In contrast, Oort records a lower peak
accuracy of $73.98\%$, a final accuracy of $71.25\%$, and a larger stability
drop of $2.73\%$. The theoretical foundations and empirical performance in our
study make HeteRo-Select a reliable solution for real-world heterogeneous FL
problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统物种分布模型（SDMs）常忽略物种间的生物相互作用，且现有方法对数据要求严格，难以处理稀疏和不完整的观测数据。

Method: 提出CISO方法，利用深度学习灵活处理不完整物种观测数据，并结合环境变量进行预测。

Result: 实验证明，CISO在预测性能上优于其他方法，且能通过结合多数据集进一步提升效果。

Conclusion: CISO是一种有潜力的生态学工具，能够整合不完全生物信息并识别跨类群物种间的潜在相互作用。

Abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used to predict species'
geographic distributions, serving as critical tools for ecological research and
conservation planning. Typically, SDMs relate species occurrences to
environmental variables representing abiotic factors, such as temperature,
precipitation, and soil properties. However, species distributions are also
strongly influenced by biotic interactions with other species, which are often
overlooked. While some methods partially address this limitation by
incorporating biotic interactions, they often assume symmetrical pairwise
relationships between species and require consistent co-occurrence data. In
practice, species observations are sparse, and the availability of information
about the presence or absence of other species varies significantly across
locations. To address these challenges, we propose CISO, a deep learning-based
method for species distribution modeling Conditioned on Incomplete Species
Observations. CISO enables predictions to be conditioned on a flexible number
of species observations alongside environmental variables, accommodating the
variability and incompleteness of available biotic data. We demonstrate our
approach using three datasets representing different species groups: sPlotOpen
for plants, SatBird for birds, and a new dataset, SatButterfly, for
butterflies. Our results show that including partial biotic information
improves predictive performance on spatially separate test sets. When
conditioned on a subset of species within the same dataset, CISO outperforms
alternative methods in predicting the distribution of the remaining species.
Furthermore, we show that combining observations from multiple datasets can
improve performance. CISO is a promising ecological tool, capable of
incorporating incomplete biotic information and identifying potential
interactions between species from disparate taxa.

*Connor Brown*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种鲁棒的Lyapunov框架，用于分析Schedule-Free（SF）方法在非凸优化中的性能，展示了无需依赖总步数T的超参数独立性，并提供了多种收敛速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典一阶方法的收敛保证依赖于预先知道总步数T的步长调度，而SF方法通过结合Polyak-Ruppert平均和动量，实现了超参数与T无关的最优性能，但非凸分析有限。

Method: 引入Lyapunov框架，仅需L-平滑性和下界性假设，将SF分析简化为单步下降不等式。

Result: 在非凸设置下，获得了与T无关的收敛速率：常数步长+PR平均为O(1/log T)，线性增长步长为O(log T/T)，多项式平均为O(T^{-(1−α)})。数值实验验证了这些速率。

Conclusion: 研究将SF的无T依赖保证扩展到非凸优化，并为未来最优非凸速率的研究指明了方向。

Abstract: First-order methods underpin most large-scale learning algorithms, yet their
classical convergence guarantees hinge on carefully scheduled step-sizes that
depend on the total horizon $T$, which is rarely known in advance. The
Schedule-Free (SF) method promises optimal performance with hyperparameters
that are independent of $T$ by interpolating between Polyak--Ruppert averaging
and momentum, but nonconvex analysis of SF has been limited or reliant on
strong global assumptions. We introduce a robust Lyapunov framework that, under
only $L$-smoothness and lower-boundedness, reduces SF analysis to a single-step
descent inequality. This yields horizon-agnostic bounds in the nonconvex
setting: $O(1/\log T)$ for constant step + PR averaging, $O(\log T/T)$ for a
linearly growing step-size, and a continuum of $O(T^{-(1-\alpha)})$ rates for
polynomial averaging. We complement these proofs with Performance Estimation
Problem (PEP) experiments that numerically validate our rates and suggest that
our $O(1/\log T)$ bound on the original nonconvex SF algorithm may tighten to
$O(1/T)$. Our work extends SF's horizon-free guarantees to smooth nonconvex

Abstract: Collaboratively fine-tuning (FT) large language models (LLMs) over
heterogeneous mobile devices fosters immense potential applications of
personalized intelligence. However, such a vision faces critical system
challenges. Conventional federated LLM FT approaches place prohibitive
computational and memory burdens on mobile hardware, and their synchronous
model aggregation protocols stall for slower devices. In this paper, we propose
Fed MobiLLM, a novel design to facilitate efficient federated LLM FT across
mobile devices with diverse computing/communication speeds and local model
architectures. In particular, Fed MobiLLM implements a pioneering
server-assisted federated side-tuning paradigm. Briefly, mobile devices perform
lightweight forward propagation computations on local data using their frozen
pre-scaled backbone LLMs, and then upload selected intermediate activations.
The server trains a shared side-network independently, eliminating client-side
backpropagation and enabling asynchronous updates. To bridge model
heterogeneity across different devices, we introduce an adaptive layer-wise
feature alignment method, which ensures consistent representations for
collaboratively tuning a shared side network. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that Fed MobiLLM can maintain robust fine-tuning performance while
achieving extremely low on-device memory, with at least 95.2% reduction in
computation overhead, 93.2% reduction in communication costs and 5.1x faster
convergence compared to existing methods, validating its efficacy for practical
LLM adaptation over heterogeneous mobile devices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于时间滞后互相关的序列预测框架（TLCCSP），通过整合时间滞后相关序列提升预测准确性，实验证明其在天气、金融和房地产数据集上显著优于单序列方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型常忽略时间滞后互相关，而这些关系对捕捉复杂时间依赖性至关重要。

Method: TLCCSP使用序列移位动态时间规整（SSDTW）算法捕捉滞后相关，并采用对比学习编码器高效近似SSDTW距离。

Result: 在天气、金融和房地产数据集上，SSDTW和对比学习编码器（CLE）分别显著降低了MSE，且CLE将SSDTW计算时间减少约99%。

Conclusion: TLCCSP框架在提升预测准确性和计算效率方面表现优异，适用于多时间序列预测任务。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is critical across various domains, such as weather,
finance and real estate forecasting, as accurate forecasts support informed
decision-making and risk mitigation. While recent deep learning models have
improved predictive capabilities, they often overlook time-lagged
cross-correlations between related sequences, which are crucial for capturing
complex temporal relationships. To address this, we propose the Time-Lagged
Cross-Correlations-based Sequence Prediction framework (TLCCSP), which enhances
forecasting accuracy by effectively integrating time-lagged cross-correlated
sequences. TLCCSP employs the Sequence Shifted Dynamic Time Warping (SSDTW)
algorithm to capture lagged correlations and a contrastive learning-based
encoder to efficiently approximate SSDTW distances.
  Experimental results on weather, finance and real estate time series datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. On the weather dataset, SSDTW
reduces mean squared error (MSE) by 16.01% compared with single-sequence
methods, while the contrastive learning encoder (CLE) further decreases MSE by
17.88%. On the stock dataset, SSDTW achieves a 9.95% MSE reduction, and CLE
reduces it by 6.13%. For the real estate dataset, SSDTW and CLE reduce MSE by
21.29% and 8.62%, respectively. Additionally, the contrastive learning approach
decreases SSDTW computational time by approximately 99%, ensuring scalability
and real-time applicability across multiple time series forecasting tasks.

TL;DR: PROPS框架通过多阶段隐私保护对齐方法，解决了LLM对齐中人类偏好标签的隐私问题，显著提升了模型效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 依赖人类反馈的LLM对齐可能泄露标注者的个人偏好和隐私，现有方法（如DP-SGD）虽提供隐私保护但可能过度牺牲模型性能。

Method: 提出PROPS框架，通过多阶段对齐，利用前一阶段私有化模型为后续阶段提供标注数据，实现偏好级隐私保护。

Result: PROPS在相同隐私预算下，比DP-SGD和RR方法分别提升3倍和2.5倍的胜率。

Conclusion: PROPS在保护隐私的同时显著提升了LLM对齐的效用，为隐私保护对齐提供了新思路。

Abstract: Alignment is a key step in developing Large Language Models (LLMs) using
human feedback to ensure adherence to human values and societal norms.
Dependence on human feedback raises privacy concerns about how much a labeler's
preferences may reveal about their personal values, beliefs, and personality
traits. Existing approaches, such as Differentially Private SGD (DP-SGD),
provide rigorous privacy guarantees by privatizing gradients during fine-tuning
and alignment but can provide more privacy than necessary as human preferences
are tied only to labels of (prompt, response) pairs and can degrade model
utility. This work focuses on LLM alignment with preference-level privacy,
which preserves the privacy of preference labels provided by humans. We propose
PROPS (PROgressively Private Self-alignment), a multi-stage privacy preserving
alignment framework where privately aligned models in previous stages can serve
as labelers for supplementing training data in the subsequent stages of
alignment. We present theoretical guarantees for PROPS as well as comprehensive
validation using multiple models (Pythia and GPT) and datasets (AlpacaEval,
Anthropic HH-RLHF, truthy-dpo-v0.1) to demonstrate the utility of PROPS over
existing methods while still providing high privacy. For the same privacy
budget, alignment via PROPS can achieve up to 3x higher win-rates compared to
DP-SGD, and 2.5x higher win-rates compared to Randomized Response (RR) based
alignment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MA-NTAE的新型自监督学习方法，用于解决高维张量数据的非线性关系学习和计算效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维张量数据在自监督学习中面临维度灾难和计算效率低下的问题，现有方法（如MLP自编码器和张量网络）难以同时满足非线性关系学习和高效计算的需求。

Method: MA-NTAE通过将经典Tucker分解推广到非线性框架，并采用Pick-and-Unfold策略，实现了对高阶张量的灵活编码。

Result: 实验表明，MA-NTAE在压缩和聚类任务中优于标准自编码器和现有张量网络，尤其在高阶高维张量上表现更显著。

Conclusion: MA-NTAE为高维张量数据的自监督学习提供了一种高效且非线性表达能力强的解决方案。

Abstract: High-dimensional data, particularly in the form of high-order tensors,
presents a major challenge in self-supervised learning. While MLP-based
autoencoders (AE) are commonly employed, their dependence on flattening
operations exacerbates the curse of dimensionality, leading to excessively
large model sizes, high computational overhead, and challenging optimization
for deep structural feature capture. Although existing tensor networks
alleviate computational burdens through tensor decomposition techniques, most
exhibit limited capability in learning non-linear relationships. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce the Mode-Aware Non-linear Tucker Autoencoder
(MA-NTAE). MA-NTAE generalized classical Tucker decomposition to a non-linear
framework and employs a Pick-and-Unfold strategy, facilitating flexible
per-mode encoding of high-order tensors via recursive unfold-encode-fold
operations, effectively integrating tensor structural priors. Notably, MA-NTAE
exhibits linear growth in computational complexity with tensor order and
proportional growth with mode dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
MA-NTAE's performance advantages over standard AE and current tensor networks
in compression and clustering tasks, which become increasingly pronounced for
higher-order, higher-dimensional tensors.

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，HARDY-MER在缺失模态场景中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HARDY-MER通过动态课程学习有效提升了模型对困难样本的处理能力，为多模态情感识别中的缺失模态问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Missing modalities have recently emerged as a critical research direction in
multimodal emotion recognition (MER). Conventional approaches typically address
this issue through missing modality reconstruction. However, these methods fail
to account for variations in reconstruction difficulty across different
samples, consequently limiting the model's ability to handle hard samples
effectively. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Hardness-Aware
Dynamic Curriculum Learning framework, termed HARDY-MER. Our framework operates
in two key stages: first, it estimates the hardness level of each sample, and
second, it strategically emphasizes hard samples during training to enhance
model performance on these challenging instances. Specifically, we first
introduce a Multi-view Hardness Evaluation mechanism that quantifies
reconstruction difficulty by considering both Direct Hardness (modality
reconstruction errors) and Indirect Hardness (cross-modal mutual information).
Meanwhile, we introduce a Retrieval-based Dynamic Curriculum Learning strategy
that dynamically adjusts the training curriculum by retrieving samples with
similar semantic information and balancing the learning focus between easy and
hard instances. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
HARDY-MER consistently outperforms existing methods in missing-modality
scenarios. Our code will be made publicly available at
https://github.com/HARDY-MER/HARDY-MER.

Motivation: 现有方法生成的数据与在线数据存在分布差距，限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出CFDG方法，利用无分类器引导扩散生成高质量数据，并结合重加权方法使生成数据更贴近在线数据。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中，CFDG平均提升15%的性能。

Conclusion: CFDG是一种通用方法，可与现有O2O RL算法结合，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Offline-to-online Reinforcement Learning (O2O RL) aims to perform online
fine-tuning on an offline pre-trained policy to minimize costly online
interactions. Existing work used offline datasets to generate data that conform
to the online data distribution for data augmentation. However, generated data
still exhibits a gap with the online data, limiting overall performance. To
address this, we propose a new data augmentation approach, Classifier-Free
Diffusion Generation (CFDG). Without introducing additional classifier training
overhead, CFDG leverages classifier-free guidance diffusion to significantly
enhance the generation quality of offline and online data with different
distributions. Additionally, it employs a reweighting method to enable more
generated data to align with the online data, enhancing performance while
maintaining the agent's stability. Experimental results show that CFDG
outperforms replaying the two data types or using a standard diffusion model to
generate new data. Our method is versatile and can be integrated with existing
offline-to-online RL algorithms. By implementing CFDG to popular methods IQL,
PEX and APL, we achieve a notable 15% average improvement in empirical
performance on the D4RL benchmark such as MuJoCo and AntMaze.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种开源方法，将大语言模型（LLMs）适配到Q编程语言（一种在量化金融中流行但互联网上较少见的语言），并通过预训练、监督微调和强化学习训练了一系列模型。最佳模型在Q基准测试中表现优于主流模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在专业领域（如小众编程语言Q）表现不佳的问题，填补技术空白。

Method: 构建Q语言的Leetcode风格评估数据集，基于Qwen-2.5系列模型进行预训练、监督微调和强化学习，训练了五种参数规模的模型。

Result: 最佳模型在Q基准测试中达到59%的pass@1准确率，显著优于Claude Opus-4和GPT-4.1。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于Q语言，还可推广到其他依赖软性或主观信号的任务。

Abstract: Even though large language models are becoming increasingly capable, it is
still unreasonable to expect them to excel at tasks that are under-represented
on the Internet. Leveraging LLMs for specialized applications, particularly in
niche programming languages and private domains, remains challenging and
largely unsolved. In this work, we address this gap by presenting a
comprehensive, open-source approach for adapting LLMs to the Q programming
language, a popular tool in quantitative finance that is much less present on
the Internet compared to Python, C, Java, and other ``mainstream" languages and
is therefore not a strong suit of general-purpose AI models. We introduce a new
Leetcode style evaluation dataset for Q, benchmark major frontier models on the
dataset, then do pretraining, supervised fine tuning, and reinforcement
learning to train a suite of reasoning and non-reasoning models based on the
Qwen-2.5 series, spanning five parameter sizes (1.5B, 3B, 7B, 14B, 32B). Our
best model achieves a pass@1 accuracy of 59 percent on our Q benchmark,
surpassing the best-performing frontier model, Claude Opus-4 by 29.5 percent.
Additionally, all models, even our 1.5B model, outperform GPT-4.1 on this task.
In addition to releasing models, code, and data, we provide a detailed
blueprint for dataset construction, model pretraining, supervised fine-tuning,
and reinforcement learning. Our methodology is broadly applicable, and we
discuss how these techniques can be extended to other tasks, including those
where evaluation may rely on soft or subjective signals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于先验知识有限且可能存在对抗性混淆，检测神经网络中的隐藏行为具有挑战性。

Method: 红队训练两个相似模型（一个仅使用良性数据，另一个包含隐藏有害行为），蓝队在有限信息下尝试识别被篡改的模型。实验使用了CNN和多种蓝队策略。

Result: 基于对抗攻击的方法在提供提示时准确率最高（100%），其他方法表现不一。LLM审计需要关于不良分布的提示。

Conclusion: 开源了审计游戏框架，研究结果有助于设计更好的审计方法。

Abstract: Detecting hidden behaviors in neural networks poses a significant challenge
due to minimal prior knowledge and potential adversarial obfuscation. We
explore this problem by framing detection as an adversarial game between two
teams: the red team trains two similar models, one trained solely on benign
data and the other trained on data containing hidden harmful behavior, with the
performance of both being nearly indistinguishable on the benign dataset. The
blue team, with limited to no information about the harmful behaviour, tries to
identify the compromised model. We experiment using CNNs and try various blue
team strategies, including Gaussian noise analysis, model diffing, integrated
gradients, and adversarial attacks under different levels of hints provided by
the red team. Results show high accuracy for adversarial-attack-based methods
(100\% correct prediction, using hints), which is very promising, whilst the
other techniques yield more varied performance. During our LLM-focused rounds,
we find that there are not many parallel methods that we could apply from our
study with CNNs. Instead, we find that effective LLM auditing methods require
some hints about the undesired distribution, which can then used in standard
black-box and open-weight methods to probe the models further and reveal their
misalignment. We open-source our auditing games (with the model and data) and
hope that our findings contribute to designing better audits.

Result: 稀疏化方法有效缓解塑性退化指标（如神经元休眠和表征崩溃），并提升多任务性能。

Conclusion: 动态稀疏化是提升MTRL系统适应性的有效工具，但其效果受上下文影响。

Abstract: Plasticity loss, a diminishing capacity to adapt as training progresses, is a
critical challenge in deep reinforcement learning. We examine this issue in
multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL), where higher representational
flexibility is crucial for managing diverse and potentially conflicting task
demands. We systematically explore how sparsification methods, particularly
Gradual Magnitude Pruning (GMP) and Sparse Evolutionary Training (SET), enhance
plasticity and consequently improve performance in MTRL agents. We evaluate
these approaches across distinct MTRL architectures (shared backbone, Mixture
of Experts, Mixture of Orthogonal Experts) on standardized MTRL benchmarks,
comparing against dense baselines, and a comprehensive range of alternative
plasticity-inducing or regularization methods. Our results demonstrate that
both GMP and SET effectively mitigate key indicators of plasticity degradation,
such as neuron dormancy and representational collapse. These plasticity
improvements often correlate with enhanced multi-task performance, with sparse
agents frequently outperforming dense counterparts and achieving competitive
results against explicit plasticity interventions. Our findings offer insights
into the interplay between plasticity, network sparsity, and MTRL designs,
highlighting dynamic sparsification as a robust but context-sensitive tool for
developing more adaptable MTRL systems.

Abstract: Conformal predictors are machine learning algorithms developed in the 1990's
by Gammerman, Vovk, and their research team, to provide set predictions with
guaranteed confidence level. Over recent years, they have grown in popularity
and have become a mainstream methodology for uncertainty quantification in the
machine learning community. From its beginning, there was an understanding that
they enable reliable machine learning with well-calibrated uncertainty
quantification. This makes them extremely beneficial for developing trustworthy
AI, a topic that has also risen in interest over the past few years, in both
the AI community and society more widely. In this article, we review the
potential for conformal prediction to contribute to trustworthy AI beyond its
marginal validity property, addressing problems such as generalization risk and
AI governance. Experiments and examples are also provided to demonstrate its
use as a well-calibrated predictor and for bias identification and mitigation.

Conclusion: QuiZSF通过结合RAG和TSPMs，显著提升了零样本时间序列预测的性能和效率。

Abstract: Time series forecasting has become increasingly important to empower diverse
applications with streaming data. Zero-shot time-series forecasting (ZSF),
particularly valuable in data-scarce scenarios, such as domain transfer or
forecasting under extreme conditions, is difficult for traditional models to
deal with. While time series pre-trained models (TSPMs) have demonstrated
strong performance in ZSF, they often lack mechanisms to dynamically
incorporate external knowledge. Fortunately, emerging retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) offers a promising path for injecting such knowledge on
demand, yet they are rarely integrated with TSPMs. To leverage the strengths of
both worlds, we introduce RAG into TSPMs to enhance zero-shot time series
forecasting. In this paper, we propose QuiZSF (Quick Zero-Shot Time Series
Forecaster), a lightweight and modular framework that couples efficient
retrieval with representation learning and model adaptation for ZSF.
Specifically, we construct a hierarchical tree-structured ChronoRAG Base (CRB)
for scalable time-series storage and domain-aware retrieval, introduce a
Multi-grained Series Interaction Learner (MSIL) to extract fine- and
coarse-grained relational features, and develop a dual-branch Model Cooperation
Coherer (MCC) that aligns retrieved knowledge with two kinds of TSPMs: Non-LLM
based and LLM based. Compared with contemporary baselines, QuiZSF, with Non-LLM
based and LLM based TSPMs as base model, respectively, ranks Top1 in 75% and
87.5% of prediction settings, while maintaining high efficiency in memory and
inference time.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了类别特征偏差和类别不平衡问题，显著改善了模型的泛化性能。

Abstract: Medical diagnosis might fail due to bias. In this work, we identified
class-feature bias, which refers to models' potential reliance on features that
are strongly correlated with only a subset of classes, leading to biased
performance and poor generalization on other classes. We aim to train a
class-unbiased model (Cls-unbias) that mitigates both class imbalance and
class-feature bias simultaneously. Specifically, we propose a class-wise
inequality loss which promotes equal contributions of classification loss from
positive-class and negative-class samples. We propose to optimize a class-wise
group distributionally robust optimization objective-a class-weighted training
objective that upweights underperforming classes-to enhance the effectiveness
of the inequality loss under class imbalance. Through synthetic and real-world
datasets, we empirically demonstrate that class-feature bias can negatively
impact model performance. Our proposed method effectively mitigates both
class-feature bias and class imbalance, thereby improving the model's
generalization ability.

Conclusion: AMFT通过动态平衡SFT和RL的奖励信号，提供了一种更稳定、高效且性能优越的LLM对齐范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically fine-tuned for reasoning tasks
through a two-stage pipeline of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by
Reinforcement Learning (RL), a process fraught with catastrophic forgetting and
suboptimal trade-offs between imitation and exploration. Recent single-stage
methods attempt to unify SFT and RL using heuristics, but lack a principled
mechanism for dynamically balancing the two paradigms. In this paper, we
reframe this challenge through the theoretical lens of \textbf{implicit
rewards}, viewing SFT and RL not as distinct methods but as complementary
reward signals. We introduce \textbf{Adaptive Meta Fine-Tuning (AMFT)}, a novel
single-stage algorithm that learns the optimal balance between SFT's implicit,
path-level reward and RL's explicit, outcome-based reward. The core of AMFT is
a \textbf{meta-gradient adaptive weight controller} that treats the SFT-RL
balance as a learnable parameter, dynamically optimizing it to maximize
long-term task performance. This forward-looking approach, regularized by
policy entropy for stability, autonomously discovers an effective training
curriculum. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on challenging benchmarks
spanning mathematical reasoning, abstract visual reasoning (General Points),
and vision-language navigation (V-IRL). AMFT consistently establishes a new
state-of-the-art and demonstrats superior generalization on out-of-distribution
(OOD) tasks. Ablation studies and training dynamic analysis confirm that the
meta-learning controller is crucial for AMFT's stability, sample efficiency,
and performance, offering a more principled and effective paradigm for LLM
alignment.Our codes are open-sourced via https://github.com/hlxtsyj/AMFT.

TL;DR: BoRA是一种改进的低秩适应方法，通过分块矩阵乘法和引入对角矩阵，以少量额外参数提升LoRA的秩和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA在大型语言模型中的低秩适应方法虽然高效，但增加秩会显著增加参数数量，BoRA旨在以更少的参数提升性能。

Method: BoRA将LoRA的矩阵乘分解为分块形式，并引入块间对角矩阵以增强多样性，从而提升秩。

Result: 实验表明BoRA在多个数据集和模型上表现优异，且具有可扩展性。

Conclusion: BoRA通过分块和多样性设计，以更少的参数实现了更高的秩和性能提升。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method
widely used in large language models (LLMs). It approximates the update of a
pretrained weight matrix $W\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ by the product of two
low-rank matrices, $BA$, where $A \in\mathbb{R}^{r\times n}$ and
$B\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times r} (r\ll\min\{m,n\})$. Increasing the dimension $r$
can raise the rank of LoRA weights (i.e., $BA$), which typically improves
fine-tuning performance but also significantly increases the number of
trainable parameters. In this paper, we propose Block Diversified Low-Rank
Adaptation (BoRA), which improves the rank of LoRA weights with a small number
of additional parameters. Specifically, BoRA treats the product $BA$ as a block
matrix multiplication, where $A$ and $B$ are partitioned into $b$ blocks along
the columns and rows, respectively (i.e., $A=[A_1,\dots,A_b]$ and
$B=[B_1,\dots,B_b]^\top$). Consequently, the product $BA$ becomes the
concatenation of the block products $B_iA_j$ for $i,j\in[b]$. To enhance the
diversity of different block products, BoRA introduces a unique diagonal matrix
$\Sigma_{i,j} \in \mathbb{R}^{r\times r}$ for each block multiplication,
resulting in $B_i \Sigma_{i,j} A_j$. By leveraging these block-wise diagonal
matrices, BoRA increases the rank of LoRA weights by a factor of $b$ while only
requiring $b^2r$ additional parameters. Extensive experiments across multiple
datasets and models demonstrate the superiority of BoRA, and ablation studies
further validate its scalability.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种利用多任务学习提升遥感模型可解释性的方法，通过将某些模态作为辅助任务目标，而非额外输入，实现了模型性能与可解释性的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感数据多样但多模态学习网络复杂且难以解释，研究旨在通过多任务学习提升模型的可解释性。

Method: 将某些模态作为辅助任务目标，与主任务一起预测，利用卫星数据的丰富信息。

Result: 方法在数据稀缺时无需额外模态，性能与多模态基线相当或更优，且能通过辅助任务解释主任务误差。

Conclusion: 该方法在分割、分类和回归任务中验证了有效性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Remote sensing provides satellite data in diverse types and formats. The
usage of multimodal learning networks exploits this diversity to improve model
performance, except that the complexity of such networks comes at the expense
of their interpretability. In this study, we explore how modalities can be
leveraged through multitask learning to intrinsically explain model behavior.
In particular, instead of additional inputs, we use certain modalities as
additional targets to be predicted along with the main task. The success of
this approach relies on the rich information content of satellite data, which
remains as input modalities. We show how this modeling context provides
numerous benefits: (1) in case of data scarcity, the additional modalities do
not need to be collected for model inference at deployment, (2) the model
performance remains comparable to the multimodal baseline performance, and in
some cases achieves better scores, (3) prediction errors in the main task can
be explained via the model behavior in the auxiliary task(s). We demonstrate
the efficiency of our approach on three datasets, including segmentation,
classification, and regression tasks. Code available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于结构保持的降阶有限元模型和潜在变量Z的实时数字孪生构建框架，利用条件注意力机制学习降阶基和非线性守恒律，确保数值适定性和守恒量精确保持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决数据稀疏或优化误差下实时数字孪生构建的挑战，支持闭环推理和传感器数据校准。

Method: 结合有限元外微积分（FEEC）框架，通过条件注意力机制学习降阶基和非线性守恒律，非侵入式集成传统有限元技术。

Result: 在复杂几何和稀疏数据（25个LES模拟）下实现准确预测，实时推理速度提升3.1x10^8倍。

Conclusion: 该框架在复杂问题中表现优异，支持实时数字孪生构建，开源实现可用。

Abstract: We present a framework for constructing real-time digital twins based on
structure-preserving reduced finite element models conditioned on a latent
variable Z. The approach uses conditional attention mechanisms to learn both a
reduced finite element basis and a nonlinear conservation law within the
framework of finite element exterior calculus (FEEC). This guarantees numerical
well-posedness and exact preservation of conserved quantities, regardless of
data sparsity or optimization error. The conditioning mechanism supports
real-time calibration to parametric variables, allowing the construction of
digital twins which support closed loop inference and calibration to sensor
data. The framework interfaces with conventional finite element machinery in a
non-invasive manner, allowing treatment of complex geometries and integration
of learned models with conventional finite element techniques.
  Benchmarks include advection diffusion, shock hydrodynamics, electrostatics,
and a complex battery thermal runaway problem. The method achieves accurate
predictions on complex geometries with sparse data (25 LES simulations),
including capturing the transition to turbulence and achieving real-time
inference ~0.1s with a speedup of 3.1x10^8 relative to LES. An open-source
implementation is available on GitHub.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“发现学习”（DL）的科学机器学习范式，通过结合主动学习、物理引导学习和零样本学习，显著减少电池设计验证的时间和能源成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电池研发因高时间和能源成本的验证过程而受限，现有数据驱动方法需要目标设计的标记数据且效率不足。

Method: DL整合主动学习、物理引导学习和零样本学习，利用历史电池设计数据，减少原型需求。

Result: 在123个工业级锂离子电池上测试，DL仅用公开数据集训练，预测误差为7.2%，节省98%时间和95%能源。

Conclusion: DL为高效数据驱动建模提供了关键进展，有望加速科学发现和工程创新。

Abstract: Fast and reliable validation of novel designs in complex physical systems
such as batteries is critical to accelerating technological innovation.
However, battery research and development remain bottlenecked by the
prohibitively high time and energy costs required to evaluate numerous new
design candidates, particularly in battery prototyping and life testing.
Despite recent progress in data-driven battery lifetime prediction, existing
methods require labeled data of target designs to improve accuracy and cannot
make reliable predictions until after prototyping, thus falling far short of
the efficiency needed to enable rapid feedback for battery design. Here, we
introduce Discovery Learning (DL), a scientific machine-learning paradigm that
integrates active learning, physics-guided learning, and zero-shot learning
into a human-like reasoning loop, drawing inspiration from learning theories in
educational psychology. DL can learn from historical battery designs and
actively reduce the need for prototyping, thus enabling rapid lifetime
evaluation for unobserved material-design combinations without requiring
additional data labeling. To test DL, we present 123 industrial-grade
large-format lithium-ion pouch cells, spanning eight material-design
combinations and diverse cycling protocols. Trained solely on public datasets
of small-capacity cylindrical cells, DL achieves 7.2% test error in predicting
the average cycle life under unknown device variability. This results in
savings of 98% in time and 95% in energy compared to industrial practices. This
work highlights the potential of uncovering insights from historical designs to
inform and accelerate the development of next-generation battery technologies.
DL represents a key advance toward efficient data-driven modeling and helps
realize the promise of machine learning for accelerating scientific discovery
and engineering innovation.

TL;DR: UniMove是一个统一的多城市人类移动预测模型，通过通用空间表示和轨迹-位置双塔架构解决城市间异质性问题，显著提升预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类移动预测对城市规划和服务优化至关重要，但现有模型因城市异质性需单独训练，效率低下。

Method: 提出轨迹-位置双塔架构和MoE Transformer块，实现通用空间编码和自适应模式处理。

Result: 在多城市数据集上，UniMove预测精度提升超过10.2%。

Conclusion: UniMove为人类移动预测的统一基础模型提供了关键进展。

Abstract: Human mobility prediction is vital for urban planning, transportation
optimization, and personalized services. However, the inherent randomness,
non-uniform time intervals, and complex patterns of human mobility, compounded
by the heterogeneity introduced by varying city structures, infrastructure, and
population densities, present significant challenges in modeling. Existing
solutions often require training separate models for each city due to distinct
spatial representations and geographic coverage. In this paper, we propose
UniMove, a unified model for multi-city human mobility prediction, addressing
two challenges: (1) constructing universal spatial representations for
effective token sharing across cities, and (2) modeling heterogeneous mobility
patterns from varying city characteristics. We propose a trajectory-location
dual-tower architecture, with a location tower for universal spatial encoding
and a trajectory tower for sequential mobility modeling. We also design MoE
Transformer blocks to adaptively select experts to handle diverse movement
patterns. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets from diverse cities
demonstrate that UniMove truly embodies the essence of a unified model. By
enabling joint training on multi-city data with mutual data enhancement, it
significantly improves mobility prediction accuracy by over 10.2\%. UniMove
represents a key advancement toward realizing a true foundational model with a
unified architecture for human mobility. We release the implementation at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了特征选择（FS）在Tsetlin机器（TM）中的应用，评估了多种FS方法，包括经典方法和新兴解释方法，并提出了一种新的基于TM的评分器。实验表明，TM内部评分器性能优越且计算成本低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TM虽然具有可解释性，但缺乏特征重要性评估工具，因此需要研究适合TM的FS方法。

Method: 采用经典过滤和嵌入式方法，以及SHAP、LIME等后解释方法，并提出基于TM条款权重和Tsetlin自动机状态的新型评分器。

Result: TM内部评分器性能竞争性强，能揭示特征交互模式，且计算成本低。

Conclusion: 本研究为TM中的FS建立了首个全面基线，为开发专用解释技术奠定了基础。

Abstract: Feature Selection (FS) is crucial for improving model interpretability,
reducing complexity, and sometimes for enhancing accuracy. The recently
introduced Tsetlin machine (TM) offers interpretable clause-based learning, but
lacks established tools for estimating feature importance. In this paper, we
adapt and evaluate a range of FS techniques for TMs, including classical filter
and embedded methods as well as post-hoc explanation methods originally
developed for neural networks (e.g., SHAP and LIME) and a novel family of
embedded scorers derived from TM clause weights and Tsetlin automaton (TA)
states. We benchmark all methods across 12 datasets, using evaluation
protocols, like Remove and Retrain (ROAR) strategy and Remove and Debias
(ROAD), to assess causal impact. Our results show that TM-internal scorers not
only perform competitively but also exploit the interpretability of clauses to
reveal interacting feature patterns. Simpler TM-specific scorers achieve
similar accuracy retention at a fraction of the computational cost. This study
establishes the first comprehensive baseline for FS in TM and paves the way for
developing specialized TM-specific interpretability techniques.

Result: 在CIFAR-10H和ImageNet-16H数据集上的实验表明，该算法能接近最优地选择专家子集，提升分类性能。

Conclusion: 多专家场景下，利用符合预测集选择专家子集是一种有效的方法。

Abstract: Decision support systems are designed to assist human experts in
classification tasks by providing conformal prediction sets derived from a
pre-trained model. This human-AI collaboration has demonstrated enhanced
classification performance compared to using either the model or the expert
independently. In this study, we focus on the selection of instance-specific
experts from a pool of multiple human experts, contrasting it with existing
research that typically focuses on single-expert scenarios. We characterize the
conditions under which multiple experts can benefit from the conformal sets.
With the insight that only certain experts may be relevant for each instance,
we explore the problem of subset selection and introduce a greedy algorithm
that utilizes conformal sets to identify the subset of expert predictions that
will be used in classifying an instance. This approach is shown to yield better
performance compared to naive methods for human subset selection. Based on real
expert predictions from the CIFAR-10H and ImageNet-16H datasets, our simulation
study indicates that our proposed greedy algorithm achieves near-optimal
subsets, resulting in improved classification performance among multiple
experts.

Motivation: 解决行为克隆策略在闭环执行中的脆弱性和错误累积问题，探索从静态专家数据中学习鲁棒驾驶策略的方法。

Method: 开发了基于Transformer的BC基线模型，并应用离线强化学习算法CQL，结合精心设计的奖励函数。

Result: 在Waymo数据集上，CQL策略的成功率比最强BC基线高3.2倍，碰撞率低7.4倍。

Conclusion: 离线强化学习方法对从静态数据中学习鲁棒、长时程驾驶策略至关重要。

Abstract: Learning robust driving policies from large-scale, real-world datasets is a
central challenge in autonomous driving, as online data collection is often
unsafe and impractical. While Behavioral Cloning (BC) offers a straightforward
approach to imitation learning, policies trained with BC are notoriously
brittle and suffer from compounding errors in closed-loop execution. This work
presents a comprehensive pipeline and a comparative study to address this
limitation. We first develop a series of increasingly sophisticated BC
baselines, culminating in a Transformer-based model that operates on a
structured, entity-centric state representation. While this model achieves low
imitation loss, we show that it still fails in long-horizon simulations. We
then demonstrate that by applying a state-of-the-art Offline Reinforcement
Learning algorithm, Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), to the same data and
architecture, we can learn a significantly more robust policy. Using a
carefully engineered reward function, the CQL agent learns a conservative value
function that enables it to recover from minor errors and avoid
out-of-distribution states. In a large-scale evaluation on 1,000 unseen
scenarios from the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, our final CQL agent achieves a
3.2x higher success rate and a 7.4x lower collision rate than the strongest BC
baseline, proving that an offline RL approach is critical for learning robust,
long-horizon driving policies from static expert data.

Result: 模型揭示了早期阶段图相关过程更显著，后期其他未知物理过程占主导，与文献一致。

Conclusion: IGND-MoE为理解神经退行性疾病的阶段特异性机制提供了新方法。

Abstract: The long-term progression of neurodegenerative diseases is commonly
conceptualized as a spatiotemporal diffusion process that consists of a graph
diffusion process across the structural brain connectome and a localized
reaction process within brain regions. However, modeling this progression
remains challenging due to 1) the scarcity of longitudinal data obtained
through irregular and infrequent subject visits and 2) the complex interplay of
pathological mechanisms across brain regions and disease stages, where
traditional models assume fixed mechanisms throughout disease progression. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel stage-aware Mixture of Experts
(MoE) framework that explicitly models how different contributing mechanisms
dominate at different disease stages through time-dependent expert
weighting.Data-wise, we utilize an iterative dual optimization method to
properly estimate the temporal position of individual observations,
constructing a co hort-level progression trajectory from irregular snapshots.
Model-wise, we enhance the spatial component with an inhomogeneous graph neural
diffusion model (IGND) that allows diffusivity to vary based on node states and
time, providing more flexible representations of brain networks. We also
introduce a localized neural reaction module to capture complex dynamics beyond
standard processes.The resulting IGND-MoE model dynamically integrates these
components across temporal states, offering a principled way to understand how
stage-specific pathological mechanisms contribute to progression. The
stage-wise weights yield novel clinical insights that align with literature,
suggesting that graph-related processes are more influential at early stages,
while other unknown physical processes become dominant later on.

Motivation: 现实环境中，环境因素（如风力变化或电磁干扰）可能导致未观测到的噪声统计漂移，导致学习型方法性能下降。

Method: OTAKNet通过一步预测测量似然建立状态估计与漂移之间的联系，并利用最优传输的几何感知成本和稳定梯度实现在线适应。

Conclusion: OTAKNet为解决噪声统计漂移问题提供了有效的在线解决方案，适用于实际部署场景。

Abstract: Learning-based filtering has demonstrated strong performance in non-linear
dynamical systems, particularly when the statistics of noise are unknown.
However, in real-world deployments, environmental factors, such as changing
wind conditions or electromagnetic interference, can induce unobserved
noise-statistics drift, leading to substantial degradation of learning-based
methods. To address this challenge, we propose OTAKNet, the first online
solution to noise-statistics drift within learning-based adaptive Kalman
filtering. Unlike existing learning-based methods that perform offline
fine-tuning using batch pointwise matching over entire trajectories, OTAKNet
establishes a connection between the state estimate and the drift via one-step
predictive measurement likelihood, and addresses it using optimal transport.
This leverages OT's geometry - aware cost and stable gradients to enable fully
online adaptation without ground truth labels or retraining. We compare OTAKNet
against classical model-based adaptive Kalman filtering and offline
learning-based filtering. The performance is demonstrated on both synthetic and
real-world NCLT datasets, particularly under limited training data.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的高计算需求促使知识蒸馏技术的应用，但学生模型可能继承教师模型在私有数据上的隐私风险。

Method: 通过六种LLM KD技术、七种NLP任务、三种教师模型家族（GPT-2、LLAMA-2、OPT）及不同规模学生模型，系统分析隐私风险。

Result: 所有KD方法均存在隐私风险，但程度不同；记忆与成员隐私风险存在显著分歧；不同模块的隐私风险差异显著。

Conclusion: KD技术在LLMs中普遍存在隐私风险，需进一步研究以平衡效率与隐私保护。

Abstract: Recent advances in Knowledge Distillation (KD) aim to mitigate the high
computational demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) by transferring knowledge
from a large ''teacher'' to a smaller ''student'' model. However, students may
inherit the teacher's privacy when the teacher is trained on private data. In
this work, we systematically characterize and investigate membership and
memorization privacy risks inherent in six LLM KD techniques. Using
instruction-tuning settings that span seven NLP tasks, together with three
teacher model families (GPT-2, LLAMA-2, and OPT), and various size student
models, we demonstrate that all existing LLM KD approaches carry membership and
memorization privacy risks from the teacher to its students. However, the
extent of privacy risks varies across different KD techniques. We
systematically analyse how key LLM KD components (KD objective functions,
student training data and NLP tasks) impact such privacy risks. We also
demonstrate a significant disagreement between memorization and membership
privacy risks of LLM KD techniques. Finally, we characterize per-block privacy
risk and demonstrate that the privacy risk varies across different blocks by a
large margin.

Conclusion: 该方法为紧凑型LLMs提供了精确、局部化且安全的知识管理方案，具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with dynamic knowledge updates,
especially when new information conflicts with deeply embedded facts. Such
conflicting factual edits often lead to two critical issues: resistance to
adopting the new fact and severe catastrophic forgetting of unrelated
knowledge. This paper introduces and evaluates a novel "unlearn-then-learn"
strategy for precise knowledge editing in LLMs, leveraging the
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) technique, Infused Adapter by Inhibiting
and Amplifying Inner Activations ($IA^3$). Crucially, this two-stage approach
is powered by an initial circuit localization phase that identifies and targets
the specific internal components responsible for encoding the conflicting fact.
Through a rigorous experimental methodology on
microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct, we demonstrate that this mechanistically
informed two-stage approach achieves near-perfect accuracy (98.50%) for the
new, modulated fact while simultaneously effectively suppressing the original
conflicting fact (96.00% forget rate). Critically, our strategy exhibits
unprecedented localization (72.00% F_control accuracy), dramatically mitigating
catastrophic forgetting observed in direct fine-tuning approaches (which showed
as low as ~20% F_control accuracy), a direct benefit of our targeted
interpretability-guided intervention. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals
a nuanced mechanism of "soft forgetting," where original knowledge is
suppressed from default retrieval but remains latent and conditionally
accessible, enhancing model safety and control. These findings represent a
significant advancement towards precise, localized, and safe knowledge
management in compact LLMs.

Motivation: 概念漂移（数据分布的变化）会显著降低模型性能，现有检测方法多为被动且对早期检测不敏感。

Method: 提出混合框架（Transformer+Autoencoder）和Trust Score方法，结合统计、重构、预测不确定性、规则违反和分类器错误趋势等多维度信号。

Result: 在航空乘客数据集中，该方法比基线方法更早、更敏感地检测到漂移，且建模效果更好。

Conclusion: 开发了一个可靠的框架，用于实时监控概念漂移。

Abstract: In applied machine learning, concept drift, which is either gradual or abrupt
changes in data distribution, can significantly reduce model performance.
Typical detection methods,such as statistical tests or reconstruction-based
models,are generally reactive and not very sensitive to early detection. Our
study proposes a hybrid framework consisting of Transformers and Autoencoders
to model complex temporal dynamics and provide online drift detection. We
create a distinct Trust Score methodology, which includes signals on (1)
statistical and reconstruction-based drift metrics, more specifically, PSI,
JSD, Transformer-AE error, (2) prediction uncertainty, (3) rules violations,
and (4) trend of classifier error aligned with the combined metrics defined by
the Trust Score. Using a time sequenced airline passenger data set with
synthetic drift, our proposed model allows for a better detection of drift
using as a whole and at different detection thresholds for both sensitivity and
interpretability compared to baseline methods and provides a strong pipeline
for drift detection in real time for applied machine learning. We evaluated
performance using a time-sequenced airline passenger dataset having the
gradually injected stimulus of drift in expectations,e.g. permuted ticket
prices in later batches, broken into 10 time segments [1].In the data, our
results support that the Transformation-Autoencoder detected drift earlier and
with more sensitivity than the autoencoders commonly used in the literature,
and provided improved modeling over more error rates and logical violations.
Therefore, a robust framework was developed to reliably monitor concept drift.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成建模在模拟自由范式（如Flow Matching和MeanFlow）中取得了显著进展，但需要进一步扩展以支持更丰富的动力学和高效采样。

Method: 通过引入平均加速度场扩展MeanFlow目标，证明其满足广义一致性条件，并通过电路复杂度分析展示其表达能力。

Result: 证明了Second-Order MeanFlow支持稳定的一步采样和高效实现，其注意力操作可在多项式时间内近似。

Conclusion: 为高阶流匹配模型奠定了理论基础，结合了丰富的动力学和实际采样效率。

Abstract: Generative modelling has seen significant advances through simulation-free
paradigms such as Flow Matching, and in particular, the MeanFlow framework,
which replaces instantaneous velocity fields with average velocities to enable
efficient single-step sampling. In this work, we introduce a theoretical study
on Second-Order MeanFlow, a novel extension that incorporates average
acceleration fields into the MeanFlow objective. We first establish the
feasibility of our approach by proving that the average acceleration satisfies
a generalized consistency condition analogous to first-order MeanFlow, thereby
supporting stable, one-step sampling and tractable loss functions. We then
characterize its expressivity via circuit complexity analysis, showing that
under mild assumptions, the Second-Order MeanFlow sampling process can be
implemented by uniform threshold circuits within the $\mathsf{TC}^0$ class.
Finally, we derive provably efficient criteria for scalable implementation by
leveraging fast approximate attention computations: we prove that attention
operations within the Second-Order MeanFlow architecture can be approximated to
within $1/\mathrm{poly}(n)$ error in time $n^{2+o(1)}$. Together, these results
lay the theoretical foundation for high-order flow matching models that combine
rich dynamics with practical sampling efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为BrainATCL的无监督框架，用于动态fMRI数据的自适应时间连接学习，解决了传统GNN难以捕捉长时依赖的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: fMRI信号的功能连接动态可能与行为和神经精神疾病相关，但传统GNN难以捕捉长时依赖，需要新的建模方法。

Method: BrainATCL通过动态调整回溯窗口，结合GINE-Mamba2骨干网络和脑结构/功能信息，学习动态功能连接的空间-时间表示。

Result: 在功能连接预测和年龄估计任务中表现优异，具有强泛化能力，包括跨会话预测场景。

Conclusion: BrainATCL为动态fMRI数据分析提供了有效工具，能够捕捉生物意义拓扑模式。

Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is an imaging technique widely
used to study human brain activity. fMRI signals in areas across the brain
transiently synchronise and desynchronise their activity in a highly structured
manner, even when an individual is at rest. These functional connectivity
dynamics may be related to behaviour and neuropsychiatric disease. To model
these dynamics, temporal brain connectivity representations are essential, as
they reflect evolving interactions between brain regions and provide insight
into transient neural states and network reconfigurations. However,
conventional graph neural networks (GNNs) often struggle to capture long-range
temporal dependencies in dynamic fMRI data. To address this challenge, we
propose BrainATCL, an unsupervised, nonparametric framework for adaptive
temporal brain connectivity learning, enabling functional link prediction and
age estimation. Our method dynamically adjusts the lookback window for each
snapshot based on the rate of newly added edges. Graph sequences are
subsequently encoded using a GINE-Mamba2 backbone to learn spatial-temporal
representations of dynamic functional connectivity in resting-state fMRI data
of 1,000 participants from the Human Connectome Project. To further improve
spatial modeling, we incorporate brain structure and function-informed edge
attributes, i.e., the left/right hemispheric identity and subnetwork membership
of brain regions, enabling the model to capture biologically meaningful
topological patterns. We evaluate our BrainATCL on two tasks: functional link
prediction and age estimation. The experimental results demonstrate superior
performance and strong generalization, including in cross-session prediction
scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出一种新的机器学习方法，提升假设检验中参数预测的精度和判别力，尤其在传统分类器难以准确预测的情况下。通过多实例学习（MIL）的理论分析，证明其优于单实例方法，并以LHC粒子碰撞数据验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统机器学习在复杂假设检验中预测精度不足的问题，尤其是在判别力要求极高的场景下。

Method: 采用多实例学习（MIL）方法，分析其与单实例学习相比的预测优势，并通过理论推导和实验验证其性能。

Result: 在LHC粒子碰撞数据中，MIL方法能够系统性地减少预测误差，并在某些情况下接近理论最大Fisher信息。

Conclusion: MIL方法在提升预测精度和判别力方面具有显著优势，尤其适用于复杂假设检验问题。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a new machine learning (ML) methodology to obtain
more precise predictions for some parameters of interest in a given hypotheses
testing problem. Our proposed method also allows ML models to have more
discriminative power in cases where it is extremely challenging for
state-of-the-art classifiers to have any level of accurate predictions. This
method can also allow us to systematically decrease the error from ML models in
their predictions. In this paper, we provide a mathematical motivation why
Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) would have more predictive power over their
single-instance counterparts. We support our theoretical claims by analyzing
the behavior of the MIL models through their scaling behaviors with respect to
the number of instances on which the model makes predictions. As a concrete
application, we constrain Wilson coefficients of the Standard Model Effective
Field Theory (SMEFT) using kinematic information from subatomic particle
collision events at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We show that under certain
circumstances, it might be possible to extract the theoretical maximum Fisher
Information latent in a dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN解释方法难以生成细粒度、可解释的理性解释，尤其是在节点属性包含丰富自然语言时。

Method: LOGIC将GNN节点嵌入投影到LLM嵌入空间，构建混合提示（软提示与文本输入交替），使LLM能推理GNN内部表示并生成自然语言解释和简洁解释子图。

Result: 在四个真实世界TAG数据集上的实验表明，LOGIC在保真度和稀疏性之间取得了良好平衡，并显著提升了人类中心指标（如洞察力）。

Conclusion: LOGIC通过将GNN内部与人类推理对齐，为基于LLM的图学习可解释性设定了新方向。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning over
structured data, including text-attributed graphs, which are common in domains
such as citation networks, social platforms, and knowledge graphs. GNNs are not
inherently interpretable and thus, many explanation methods have been proposed.
However, existing explanation methods often struggle to generate interpretable,
fine-grained rationales, especially when node attributes include rich natural
language. In this work, we introduce LOGIC, a lightweight, post-hoc framework
that uses large language models (LLMs) to generate faithful and interpretable
explanations for GNN predictions. LOGIC projects GNN node embeddings into the
LLM embedding space and constructs hybrid prompts that interleave soft prompts
with textual inputs from the graph structure. This enables the LLM to reason
about GNN internal representations and produce natural language explanations
along with concise explanation subgraphs. Our experiments across four
real-world TAG datasets demonstrate that LOGIC achieves a favorable trade-off
between fidelity and sparsity, while significantly improving human-centric
metrics such as insightfulness. LOGIC sets a new direction for LLM-based
explainability in graph learning by aligning GNN internals with human
reasoning.

Motivation: 解决分布式后端系统中多级服务调用结构的性能波动预测挑战。

Method: 将系统状态抽象为图结构序列，结合运行时特征和服务调用关系，构建统一的时空建模框架，使用图卷积网络和高门控循环网络提取依赖信息和动态演化。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，模型在MAE、RMSE和R2等关键指标上优于现有方法，且在不同负载和结构复杂度下表现稳健。

Conclusion: 该模型在服务性能管理任务中具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper proposes a spatiotemporal graph neural network-based performance
prediction algorithm to address the challenge of forecasting performance
fluctuations in distributed backend systems with multi-level service call
structures. The method abstracts system states at different time slices into a
sequence of graph structures. It integrates the runtime features of service
nodes with the invocation relationships among services to construct a unified
spatiotemporal modeling framework. The model first applies a graph
convolutional network to extract high-order dependency information from the
service topology. Then it uses a gated recurrent network to capture the dynamic
evolution of performance metrics over time. A time encoding mechanism is also
introduced to enhance the model's ability to represent non-stationary temporal
sequences. The architecture is trained in an end-to-end manner, optimizing the
multi-layer nested structure to achieve high-precision regression of future
service performance metrics. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed
method, a large-scale public cluster dataset is used. A series of
multi-dimensional experiments are designed, including variations in time
windows and concurrent load levels. These experiments comprehensively evaluate
the model's predictive performance and stability. The experimental results show
that the proposed model outperforms existing representative methods across key
metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R2. It maintains strong robustness under varying
load intensities and structural complexities. These results demonstrate the
model's practical potential for backend service performance management tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在在线强化学习中，标量反馈通常噪声大且不一致，限制了奖励模型的准确性和泛化能力。

Method: Pref-GUIDE将标量反馈转化为偏好数据，通过短窗口比较行为和过滤模糊反馈（Individual），并通过用户群体投票形成共识偏好（Voting）。

Result: 在三个挑战性环境中，Pref-GUIDE显著优于标量反馈基线，投票变体甚至超过专家设计的密集奖励。

Conclusion: Pref-GUIDE通过结构化偏好和群体反馈，为在线强化学习中利用人类输入提供了可扩展且原则性的方法。

Abstract: Training reinforcement learning agents with human feedback is crucial when
task objectives are difficult to specify through dense reward functions. While
prior methods rely on offline trajectory comparisons to elicit human
preferences, such data is unavailable in online learning scenarios where agents
must adapt on the fly. Recent approaches address this by collecting real-time
scalar feedback to guide agent behavior and train reward models for continued
learning after human feedback becomes unavailable. However, scalar feedback is
often noisy and inconsistent, limiting the accuracy and generalization of
learned rewards. We propose Pref-GUIDE, a framework that transforms real-time
scalar feedback into preference-based data to improve reward model learning for
continual policy training. Pref-GUIDE Individual mitigates temporal
inconsistency by comparing agent behaviors within short windows and filtering
ambiguous feedback. Pref-GUIDE Voting further enhances robustness by
aggregating reward models across a population of users to form consensus
preferences. Across three challenging environments, Pref-GUIDE significantly
outperforms scalar-feedback baselines, with the voting variant exceeding even
expert-designed dense rewards. By reframing scalar feedback as structured
preferences with population feedback, Pref-GUIDE offers a scalable and
principled approach for harnessing human input in online reinforcement
learning.

Conclusion: LLMs在心血管疾病预测和个性化医疗中展现出潜力。

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) prediction remains a tremendous challenge due to
its multifactorial etiology and global burden of morbidity and mortality.
Despite the growing availability of genomic and electrophysiological data,
extracting biologically meaningful insights from such high-dimensional, noisy,
and sparsely annotated datasets remains a non-trivial task. Recently, LLMs has
been applied effectively to predict structural variations in biological
sequences. In this work, we explore the potential of fine-tuned LLMs to predict
cardiac diseases and SNPs potentially leading to CVD risk using genetic markers
derived from high-throughput genomic profiling. We investigate the effect of
genetic patterns associated with cardiac conditions and evaluate how LLMs can
learn latent biological relationships from structured and semi-structured
genomic data obtained by mapping genetic aspects that are inherited from the
family tree. By framing the problem as a Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning task,
the models are prompted to generate disease labels and articulate informed
clinical deductions across diverse patient profiles and phenotypes. The
findings highlight the promise of LLMs in contributing to early detection, risk
assessment, and ultimately, the advancement of personalized medicine in cardiac
care.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半非负矩阵分解算法多为迭代且易陷入局部最优，缺乏全局最优解的理论保证。

Method: 基于输入数据的散布矩阵，通过正交分解得到全局最优解，严格证明其最小化重构误差。

Result: 在合成数据和UCI Wine数据集上，新方法重构误差更低，且在低秩情况下恢复为非负分解。

Conclusion: 新方法提供了理论保证和实际优势，为矩阵分解优化和数据分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: Semi-Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (semi-NMF) extends classical
Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) by allowing the basis matrix to contain
both positive and negative entries, making it suitable for decomposing data
with mixed signs. However, most existing semi-NMF algorithms are iterative,
non-convex, and prone to local minima. In this paper, we propose a novel method
that yields a globally optimal solution to the semi-NMF problem under the
Frobenius norm, through an orthogonal decomposition derived from the scatter
matrix of the input data. We rigorously prove that our solution attains the
global minimum of the reconstruction error. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
when the input matrix is nonnegative, our method often achieves lower
reconstruction error than standard NMF algorithms, although unfortunately the
basis matrix may not satisfy nonnegativity. In particular, in low-rank cases
such as rank 1 or 2, our solution reduces exactly to a nonnegative
factorization, recovering the NMF structure. We validate our approach through
experiments on both synthetic data and the UCI Wine dataset, showing that our
method consistently outperforms existing NMF and semi-NMF methods in terms of
reconstruction accuracy. These results confirm that our globally optimal,
non-iterative formulation offers both theoretical guarantees and empirical
advantages, providing a new perspective on matrix factorization in optimization
and data analysis.

Motivation: DPO方法在理论上与其推导不一致，可能导致训练不稳定和奖励攻击，因此需要改进。

Method: 从RLHF最优条件直接推导出新的损失函数，针对有限的、由奖励决定的对数差值。

Result: 新方法避免了DPO中的大梯度问题，提高了稳定性，并在实验中显著优于标准DPO基线。

Conclusion: 提出的损失函数更稳定且有效，在模型对齐中表现优异。

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is
commonly achieved through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) simplified this paradigm by establishing a
direct mapping between the optimal policy and a reward function, eliminating
the need for an explicit reward model. However, we argue that the DPO loss
function is theoretically misaligned with its own derivation, as it promotes
the indefinite maximization of a logits difference, which can lead to training
instability and reward hacking. In this paper, we propose a novel loss function
derived directly from the RLHF optimality condition. Our proposed loss targets
a specific, finite value for the logits difference, which is dictated by the
underlying reward, rather than its maximization. We provide a theoretical
analysis, including a gradient-based comparison, to demonstrate that our method
avoids the large gradients that plague DPO when the probability of dispreferred
responses approaches zero. This inherent stability prevents reward hacking and
leads to more effective alignment. We validate our approach by fine-tuning a
Qwen2.5-7B model, showing significant win-rate improvements over a standard DPO
baseline and achieving competitive performance against larger models like
Llama-3.1-8B.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低精度训练虽能降低计算和内存成本，但梯度量化的收缩和噪声可能改变SGD的收敛行为，需深入研究。

Method: 通过梯度收缩模型分析SGD收敛，将每个梯度缩放为$q_k \in (0,1]$并添加零均值量化噪声，等效于调整步长。

Result: 低精度SGD仍收敛，但速度受$q_{\min}$影响减慢，且量化噪声导致渐近误差增加。

Conclusion: 量化通过梯度收缩和噪声影响SGD收敛，需权衡精度损失与计算效率。

Abstract: Low-precision training has become essential for reducing the computational
and memory costs of large-scale deep learning. However, quantization of
gradients introduces both magnitude shrinkage and additive noise, which can
alter the convergence behavior of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In this
work, we study the convergence of SGD under a gradient shrinkage model, where
each stochastic gradient is scaled by a factor $q_k \in (0,1]$ and perturbed by
zero-mean quantization noise. We show that this shrinkage is equivalent to
replacing the nominal stepsize $\mu_k$ with an effective stepsize $\mu_k q_k$,
which slows convergence when $q_{\min} < 1$. Under standard smoothness and
bounded-variance assumptions, we prove that low-precision SGD still converges,
but at a reduced rate determined by $q_{\min}$, and with an increased
asymptotic error floor due to quantization noise. We theoretically analyze how
reduced numerical precision slows down training by modeling it as gradient
shrinkage in the standard SGD convergence framework.

Method: 通过理论分析，证明双层单头Transformer可以表示任何条件k-gram，并进一步分析其学习动态。

Result: 双层单头Transformer能够高效表示高阶马尔可夫过程，且学习过程中能形成有效的上下文表示。

Conclusion: 浅层Transformer架构在结构化序列建模任务中表现出强大的ICL能力，深化了对Transformer ICL机制的理解。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a hallmark capability of transformers, through
which trained models learn to adapt to new tasks by leveraging information from
the input context. Prior work has shown that ICL emerges in transformers due to
the presence of special circuits called induction heads. Given the equivalence
between induction heads and conditional k-grams, a recent line of work modeling
sequential inputs as Markov processes has revealed the fundamental impact of
model depth on its ICL capabilities: while a two-layer transformer can
efficiently represent a conditional 1-gram model, its single-layer counterpart
cannot solve the task unless it is exponentially large. However, for higher
order Markov sources, the best known constructions require at least three
layers (each with a single attention head) - leaving open the question: can a
two-layer single-head transformer represent any kth-order Markov process? In
this paper, we precisely address this and theoretically show that a two-layer
transformer with one head per layer can indeed represent any conditional
k-gram. Thus, our result provides the tightest known characterization of the
interplay between transformer depth and Markov order for ICL. Building on this,
we further analyze the learning dynamics of our two-layer construction,
focusing on a simplified variant for first-order Markov chains, illustrating
how effective in-context representations emerge during training. Together,
these results deepen our current understanding of transformer-based ICL and
illustrate how even shallow architectures can surprisingly exhibit strong ICL
capabilities on structured sequence modeling tasks.

Motivation: 传统方法（如高斯过程和神经过程）在处理大规模数据或复杂多模态分布时存在局限性，而神经扩散过程（NDPs）在输入耦合和终点语义匹配上表现不足。

Result: 在合成数据、EEG信号回归和图像回归任务中，NBP显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: NBP通过DDPM风格的桥采样，提升了结构化预测任务的性能和理论一致性。

Abstract: Learning stochastic functions from partially observed context-target pairs is
a fundamental problem in probabilistic modeling. Traditional models like
Gaussian Processes (GPs) face scalability issues with large datasets and assume
Gaussianity, limiting their applicability. While Neural Processes (NPs) offer
more flexibility, they struggle with capturing complex, multi-modal target
distributions. Neural Diffusion Processes (NDPs) enhance expressivity through a
learned diffusion process but rely solely on conditional signals in the
denoising network, resulting in weak input coupling from an unconditional
forward process and semantic mismatch at the diffusion endpoint. In this work,
we propose Neural Bridge Processes (NBPs), a novel method for modeling
stochastic functions where inputs x act as dynamic anchors for the entire
diffusion trajectory. By reformulating the forward kernel to explicitly depend
on x, NBP enforces a constrained path that strictly terminates at the
supervised target. This approach not only provides stronger gradient signals
but also guarantees endpoint coherence. We validate NBPs on synthetic data, EEG
signal regression and image regression tasks, achieving substantial
improvements over baselines. These results underscore the effectiveness of
DDPM-style bridge sampling in enhancing both performance and theoretical
consistency for structured prediction tasks.

Abstract: Estimating individualized treatment effects from observational data presents
a persistent challenge due to unmeasured confounding and structural bias.
Causal Machine Learning (causal ML) methods, such as causal trees and doubly
robust estimators, provide tools for estimating conditional average treatment
effects. These methods have limited effectiveness in complex real-world
environments due to the presence of latent confounders or those described in
unstructured formats. Moreover, reliance on domain experts for confounder
identification and rule interpretation introduces high annotation cost and
scalability concerns. In this work, we proposed Large Language Model-based
agents for automated confounder discovery and subgroup analysis that integrate
agents into the causal ML pipeline to simulate domain expertise. Our framework
systematically performs subgroup identification and confounding structure
discovery by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of LLM-based agents, which
reduces human dependency while preserving interpretability. Experiments on
real-world medical datasets show that our proposed approach enhances treatment
effect estimation robustness by narrowing confidence intervals and uncovering
unrecognized confounding biases. Our findings suggest that LLM-based agents
offer a promising path toward scalable, trustworthy, and semantically aware
causal inference.

Abstract: We present EDGE, a general-purpose, misconception-aware adaptive learning
framework composed of four stages: Evaluate (ability and state estimation),
Diagnose (posterior infer-ence of misconceptions), Generate (counterfactual
item synthesis), and Exercise (index-based retrieval scheduling). EDGE unifies
psychometrics (IRT/Bayesian state space models), cog-nitive diagnostics
(misconception discovery from distractor patterns and response latencies),
contrastive item generation (minimal perturbations that invalidate learner
shortcuts while pre-serving psychometric validity), and principled scheduling
(a restless bandit approximation to spaced retrieval). We formalize a composite
readiness metric, EdgeScore, prove its monotonicity and Lipschitz continuity,
and derive an index policy that is near-optimal under mild assumptions on
forgetting and learning gains. We further establish conditions under which
counterfactual items provably reduce the posterior probability of a targeted
misconception faster than standard practice. The paper focuses on theory and
implementable pseudocode; empirical study is left to future work.

Conclusion: CNSDiff有效减少假硬负样本，提升推荐系统在分布偏移下的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Heuristic negative sampling enhances recommendation performance by selecting
negative samples of varying hardness levels from predefined candidate pools to
guide the model toward learning more accurate decision boundaries. However, our
empirical and theoretical analyses reveal that unobserved environmental
confounders (e.g., exposure or popularity biases) in candidate pools may cause
heuristic sampling methods to introduce false hard negatives (FHNS). These
misleading samples can encourage the model to learn spurious correlations
induced by such confounders, ultimately compromising its generalization ability
under distribution shifts. To address this issue, we propose a novel method
named Causal Negative Sampling via Diffusion (CNSDiff). By synthesizing
negative samples in the latent space via a conditional diffusion process,
CNSDiff avoids the bias introduced by predefined candidate pools and thus
reduces the likelihood of generating FHNS. Moreover, it incorporates a causal
regularization term to explicitly mitigate the influence of environmental
confounders during the negative sampling process, leading to robust negatives

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在强化学习中解决风险敏感控制问题的方法，通过最大化失真风险度量（DRM）来找到风险最优策略，并证明了算法的二阶收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献中，风险敏感目标通常仅收敛于一阶稳定点，而风险中性目标可能收敛于二阶稳定点。本文旨在填补这一空白，提出一种能够收敛于风险敏感目标的二阶稳定点的算法。

Method: 使用似然比方法推导了DRM目标的海森矩阵定理，并基于此提出了从样本轨迹中估计DRM梯度和海森矩阵的自然方法。进一步提出了一种立方正则化的策略牛顿算法。

Result: 实验验证了理论结果，算法能够收敛到DRM目标的ε-二阶稳定点（ε-SOSP），并确保逃离鞍点。样本复杂度为O(ε^{-3.5})。

Conclusion: 本文首次展示了风险敏感目标的二阶收敛性，填补了现有文献的空白，为风险敏感控制提供了新的理论和方法支持。

Abstract: We consider the problem of risk-sensitive control in a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework. In particular, we aim to find a risk-optimal policy by
maximizing the distortion riskmetric (DRM) of the discounted reward in a finite
horizon Markov decision process (MDP). DRMs are a rich class of risk measures
that include several well-known risk measures as special cases. We derive a
policy Hessian theorem for the DRM objective using the likelihood ratio method.
Using this result, we propose a natural DRM Hessian estimator from sample
trajectories of the underlying MDP. Next, we present a cubic-regularized policy
Newton algorithm for solving this problem in an on-policy RL setting using
estimates of the DRM gradient and Hessian. Our proposed algorithm is shown to
converge to an $\epsilon$-second-order stationary point ($\epsilon$-SOSP) of
the DRM objective, and this guarantee ensures the escaping of saddle points.
The sample complexity of our algorithms to find an $ \epsilon$-SOSP is
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3.5})$. Our experiments validate the theoretical
findings. To the best of our knowledge, our is the first work to present
convergence to an $\epsilon$-SOSP of a risk-sensitive objective, while existing
works in the literature have either shown convergence to a first-order
stationary point of a risk-sensitive objective, or a SOSP of a risk-neutral
one.

Abstract: Reliable seizure detection is critical for diagnosing and managing epilepsy,
yet clinical workflows remain dependent on time-consuming manual EEG
interpretation. While machine learning has shown promise, existing approaches
often rely on dataset-specific optimisations, limiting their real-world
applicability and reproducibility. Here, we introduce an innovative,
open-source machine-learning framework that enables robust and generalisable
seizure detection across varied clinical datasets. We evaluate our approach on
two publicly available EEG datasets that differ in patient populations and
electrode configurations. To enhance robustness, the framework incorporates an
automated pre-processing pipeline to standardise data and a majority voting
mechanism, in which multiple models independently assess each second of EEG
before reaching a final decision. We train, tune, and evaluate models within
each dataset, assessing their cross-dataset transferability. Our models achieve
high within-dataset performance (AUC 0.904+/-0.059 for CHB-MIT and
0.864+/-0.060 for TUSZ) and demonstrate strong generalisation across datasets
despite differences in EEG setups and populations (AUC 0.615+/-0.039 for models
trained on CHB-MIT and tested on TUSZ and 0.762+/-0.175 in the reverse case)
without any post-processing. Furthermore, a mild post-processing improved the
within-dataset results to 0.913+/-0.064 and 0.867+/-0.058 and cross-dataset
results to 0.619+/-0.036 and 0.768+/-0.172. These results underscore the
potential of, and essential considerations for, deploying our framework in
diverse clinical settings. By making our methodology fully reproducible, we
provide a foundation for advancing clinically viable, dataset-agnostic seizure
detection systems. This approach has the potential for widespread adoption,
complementing rather than replacing expert interpretation, and accelerating
clinical integration.

Abstract: The goal of data attribution is to trace the model's predictions through the
learning algorithm and back to its training data. thereby identifying the most
influential training samples and understanding how the model's behavior leads
to particular predictions. Understanding how individual training examples
influence a model's predictions is fundamental for machine learning
interpretability, data debugging, and model accountability. Influence
functions, originating from robust statistics, offer an efficient, first-order
approximation to estimate the impact of marginally upweighting or removing a
data point on a model's learned parameters and its subsequent predictions,
without the need for expensive retraining. This paper comprehensively reviews
the data attribution capability of influence functions in deep learning. We
discuss their theoretical foundations, recent algorithmic advances for
efficient inverse-Hessian-vector product estimation, and evaluate their
effectiveness for data attribution and mislabel detection. Finally,
highlighting current challenges and promising directions for unleashing the
huge potential of influence functions in large-scale, real-world deep learning
scenarios.

Motivation: 当前SSL中前置任务的选择缺乏理论依据，本文旨在通过统一Nesy和SSL的理论框架，提供一种理论支持的方法来预测前置任务的有效性。

Method: 基于不可靠知识（假设）扩展Nesy理论，提出三个关键因素（知识可学习性、可靠性、完整性）的理论分析，并设计操作化方案。

Result: 实验验证了预测性能与实际性能的高度相关性，证明了理论和评估方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文的理论和方法为SSL中前置任务的选择提供了理论依据，改变了当前依赖启发式选择的现状。

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic (Nesy) learning improves the target task performance of models
by enabling them to satisfy knowledge, while semi/self-supervised learning
(SSL) improves the target task performance by designing unsupervised pretext
tasks for unlabeled data to make models satisfy corresponding assumptions. We
extend the Nesy theory based on reliable knowledge to the scenario of
unreliable knowledge (i.e., assumptions), thereby unifying the theoretical
frameworks of SSL and Nesy. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we
demonstrate that, in theory, the impact of pretext tasks on target performance
hinges on three factors: knowledge learnability with respect to the model,
knowledge reliability with respect to the data, and knowledge completeness with
respect to the target. We further propose schemes to operationalize these
theoretical metrics, and thereby develop a method that can predict the
effectiveness of pretext tasks in advance. This will change the current status
quo in practical applications, where the selections of unsupervised tasks are
heuristic-based rather than theory-based, and it is difficult to evaluate the
rationality of unsupervised pretext task selection before testing the model on
the target task. In experiments, we verify a high correlation between the
predicted performance-estimated using minimal data-and the actual performance
achieved after large-scale semi-supervised or self-supervised learning, thus
confirming the validity of the theory and the effectiveness of the evaluation
method.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）在多模态任务中的突破性进展，如何在资源受限的边缘设备上高效部署成为关键挑战。MoE架构通过稀疏激活增强模型能力，但在实际部署中面临量化精度和内存限制两大难题。

Method: 采用Hessian感知量化（HAQ）实现激活和权重的8位联合量化，并结合专家级协同卸载与推理机制，优化CPU-GPU资源调度。

Abstract: With the breakthrough progress of large language models (LLMs) in natural
language processing and multimodal tasks, efficiently deploying them on
resource-constrained edge devices has become a critical challenge. The Mixture
of Experts (MoE) architecture enhances model capacity through sparse
activation, but faces two major difficulties in practical deployment: (1) The
presence of numerous outliers in activation distributions leads to severe
degradation in quantization accuracy for both activations and weights,
significantly impairing inference performance; (2) Under limited memory,
efficient offloading and collaborative inference of expert modules struggle to
balance latency and throughput. To address these issues, this paper proposes an
efficient MoE edge deployment scheme based on Hessian-Aware Quantization (HAQ)
and CPU-GPU collaborative inference. First, by introducing smoothed Hessian
matrix quantization, we achieve joint 8-bit quantization of activations and
weights, which significantly alleviates the accuracy loss caused by outliers
while ensuring efficient implementation on mainstream hardware. Second, we
design an expert-level collaborative offloading and inference mechanism, which,
combined with expert activation path statistics, enables efficient deployment
and scheduling of expert modules between CPU and GPU, greatly reducing memory
footprint and inference latency. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our method on mainstream large models such as the OPT series
and Mixtral 8*7B: on datasets like Wikitext2 and C4, the inference accuracy of
the low-bit quantized model approaches that of the full-precision model, while
GPU memory usage is reduced by about 60%, and inference latency is
significantly improved.

Abstract: Stochastic interpolants offer a robust framework for continuously

convergence guarantees for practical numerical schemes remain largely
unexplored. In this work, we address the finite-time convergence analysis of
numerical implementations for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) derived
from stochastic interpolants. Specifically, we establish novel finite-time
error bounds in total variation distance for two widely used numerical
integrators: the first-order forward Euler method and the second-order Heun's
method. Furthermore, our analysis on the iteration complexity of specific
stochastic interpolant constructions provides optimized schedules to enhance
computational efficiency. Our theoretical findings are corroborated by
numerical experiments, which validate the derived error bounds and complexity
analyses.

Abstract: \textbf{Introduction:} Accurate prediction of Phage Virion Proteins (PVP) is
essential for genomic studies due to their crucial role as structural elements
in bacteriophages. Computational tools, particularly machine learning, have
emerged for annotating phage protein sequences from high-throughput sequencing.
However, effective annotation requires specialized sequence encodings. Our
paper introduces ProteoKnight, a new image-based encoding method that addresses
spatial constraints in existing techniques, yielding competitive performance in
PVP classification using pre-trained convolutional neural networks.
Additionally, our study evaluates prediction uncertainty in binary PVP
classification through Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD). \textbf{Methods:}
ProteoKnight adapts the classical DNA-Walk algorithm for protein sequences,
incorporating pixel colors and adjusting walk distances to capture intricate
protein features. Encoded sequences were classified using multiple pre-trained
CNNs. Variance and entropy measures assessed prediction uncertainty across
proteins of various classes and lengths. \textbf{Results:} Our experiments
achieved 90.8% accuracy in binary classification, comparable to
state-of-the-art methods. Multi-class classification accuracy remains
suboptimal. Our uncertainty analysis unveils variability in prediction
confidence influenced by protein class and sequence length.
\textbf{Conclusions:} Our study surpasses frequency chaos game representation
(FCGR) by introducing novel image encoding that mitigates spatial information
loss limitations. Our classification technique yields accurate and robust PVP
predictions while identifying low-confidence predictions.

Conclusion: 证明了高维梯度流在特定条件下可简化为低维动态，为隐式偏置研究提供了理论基础。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in the theory of deep learning is to understand
whether gradient-based training in high-dimensional parameter spaces can be
captured by simpler, lower-dimensional structures, leading to so-called
implicit bias. As a stepping stone, we study when a gradient flow on a
high-dimensional variable $\theta$ implies an intrinsic gradient flow on a
lower-dimensional variable $z = \phi(\theta)$, for an architecture-related
function $\phi$. We express a so-called intrinsic dynamic property and show how
it is related to the study of conservation laws associated with the
factorization $\phi$. This leads to a simple criterion based on the inclusion
of kernels of linear maps which yields a necessary condition for this property
to hold. We then apply our theory to general ReLU networks of arbitrary depth
and show that, for any initialization, it is possible to rewrite the flow as an
intrinsic dynamic in a lower dimension that depends only on $z$ and the
initialization, when $\phi$ is the so-called path-lifting. In the case of
linear networks with $\phi$ the product of weight matrices, so-called balanced
initializations are also known to enable such a dimensionality reduction; we
generalize this result to a broader class of {\em relaxed balanced}
initializations, showing that, in certain configurations, these are the
\emph{only} initializations that ensure the intrinsic dynamic property.
Finally, for the linear neural ODE associated with the limit of infinitely deep
linear networks, with relaxed balanced initialization, we explicitly express
the corresponding intrinsic dynamics.

Abstract: Modern methods of generative modelling and unpaired image-to-image
translation based on Schr\"odinger bridges and stochastic optimal control
theory aim to transform an initial density to a target one in an optimal way.
In the present paper, we assume that we only have access to i.i.d. samples from
initial and final distributions. This makes our setup suitable for both
generative modelling and unpaired image-to-image translation. Relying on the
stochastic optimal control approach, we choose an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process as
the reference one and estimate the corresponding Schr\"odinger potential.
Introducing a risk function as the Kullback-Leibler divergence between
couplings, we derive tight bounds on generalization ability of an empirical
risk minimizer in a class of Schr\"odinger potentials including Gaussian
mixtures. Thanks to the mixing properties of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, we
almost achieve fast rates of convergence up to some logarithmic factors in
favourable scenarios. We also illustrate performance of the suggested approach
with numerical experiments.

Method: 研究多层SSM（结合输入独立和非负SSM）是否有效，特别针对对角线转移矩阵的高效SSM。

Result: 实验表明，即使结合多层SSM，仍无法解决奇偶校验任务，需输入依赖且包含负特征值的递归层。

Conclusion: 输入依赖和负特征值是递归层解决状态跟踪任务的关键，实验验证了这一点。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that LRNN models such as S4D, Mamba, and DeltaNet lack
state-tracking capability due to either time-invariant transition matrices or
restricted eigenvalue ranges. To address this, input-dependent transition
matrices, particularly those that are complex or non-triangular, have been
proposed to enhance SSM performance on such tasks. While existing theorems
demonstrate that both input-independent and non-negative SSMs are incapable of
solving simple state-tracking tasks, such as parity, regardless of depth, they
do not explore whether combining these two types in a multilayer SSM could
help. We investigate this question for efficient SSMs with diagonal transition
matrices and show that such combinations still fail to solve parity. This
implies that a recurrence layer must both be input-dependent and include
negative eigenvalues. Our experiments support this conclusion by analyzing an
SSM model that combines S4D and Mamba layers.

Conclusion: 论文通过先验假设和优化方法，解决了奖励函数恢复问题，并提供了高效且准确的算法。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of recovering time-varying reward
functions from either optimal policies or demonstrations coming from a max
entropy reinforcement learning problem. This problem is highly ill-posed
without additional assumptions on the underlying rewards. However, in many
applications, the rewards are indeed parsimonious, and some prior information
is available. We consider two such priors on the rewards: 1) rewards are mostly
constant and they change infrequently, 2) rewards can be represented by a
linear combination of a small number of feature functions. We first show that
the reward identification problem with the former prior can be recast as a
sparsification problem subject to linear constraints. Moreover, we give a
polynomial-time algorithm that solves this sparsification problem exactly.
Then, we show that identifying rewards representable with the minimum number of
features can be recast as a rank minimization problem subject to linear
constraints, for which convex relaxations of rank can be invoked. In both
cases, these observations lead to efficient optimization-based reward
identification algorithms. Several examples are given to demonstrate the
accuracy of the recovered rewards as well as their generalizability.

Result: 实验表明，DeepLight在公平威胁评分（ETS）上比现有方法提升18%-30%。

Conclusion: DeepLight为闪电预测提供了更稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Lightning, a common feature of severe meteorological conditions, poses
significant risks, from direct human injuries to substantial economic losses.
These risks are further exacerbated by climate change. Early and accurate
prediction of lightning would enable preventive measures to safeguard people,
protect property, and minimize economic losses. In this paper, we present
DeepLight, a novel deep learning architecture for predicting lightning
occurrences. Existing prediction models face several critical limitations: they
often struggle to capture the dynamic spatial context and inherent uncertainty
of lightning events, underutilize key observational data, such as radar
reflectivity and cloud properties, and rely heavily on Numerical Weather
Prediction (NWP) systems, which are both computationally expensive and highly
sensitive to parameter settings. To overcome these challenges, DeepLight
leverages multi-source meteorological data, including radar reflectivity, cloud
properties, and historical lightning occurrences through a dual-encoder
architecture. By employing multi-branch convolution techniques, it dynamically
captures spatial correlations across varying extents. Furthermore, its novel
Hazy Loss function explicitly addresses the spatio-temporal uncertainty of
lightning by penalizing deviations based on proximity to true events, enabling
the model to better learn patterns amidst randomness. Extensive experiments
show that DeepLight improves the Equitable Threat Score (ETS) by 18%-30% over
state-of-the-art methods, establishing it as a robust solution for lightning
prediction.

Conclusion: DOOL为耗散方程提供了一种高效的无监督学习框架，并可扩展至不直接遵循OVP的二阶波模型。

Abstract: Existing operator learning methods rely on supervised training with
high-fidelity simulation data, introducing significant computational cost. In
this work, we propose the deep Onsager operator learning (DOOL) method, a novel
unsupervised framework for solving dissipative equations. Rooted in the Onsager
variational principle (OVP), DOOL trains a deep operator network by directly
minimizing the OVP-defined Rayleighian functional, requiring no labeled data,
and then proceeds in time explicitly through conservation/change laws for the
solution. Another key innovation here lies in the spatiotemporal decoupling
strategy: the operator's trunk network processes spatial coordinates
exclusively, thereby enhancing training efficiency, while integrated external
time stepping enables temporal extrapolation. Numerical experiments on typical
dissipative equations validate the effectiveness of the DOOL method, and
systematic comparisons with supervised DeepONet and MIONet demonstrate its
enhanced performance. Extensions are made to cover the second-order wave models
with dissipation that do not directly follow OVP.

Result: 在标准DQN变体和基准任务中，SCORER提高了样本效率和最终性能。

Conclusion: 通过结构化感知与控制动态的算法设计，可实现性能提升，无需复杂辅助目标或架构。

Abstract: Integrated, end-to-end learning of representations and policies remains a
cornerstone of deep reinforcement learning (RL). However, to address the
challenge of learning effective features from a sparse reward signal, recent
trends have shifted towards adding complex auxiliary objectives or fully
decoupling the two processes, often at the cost of increased design complexity.
This work proposes an alternative to both decoupling and naive end-to-end
learning, arguing that performance can be significantly improved by structuring
the interaction between distinct perception and control networks with a
principled, game-theoretic dynamic. We formalize this dynamic by introducing
the Stackelberg Coupled Representation and Reinforcement Learning (SCORER)
framework, which models the interaction between perception and control as a
Stackelberg game. The perception network (leader) strategically learns features
to benefit the control network (follower), whose own objective is to minimize
its Bellman error. We approximate the game's equilibrium with a practical
two-timescale algorithm. Applied to standard DQN variants on benchmark tasks,
SCORER improves sample efficiency and final performance. Our results show that
performance gains can be achieved through principled algorithmic design of the
perception-control dynamic, without requiring complex auxiliary objectives or
architectures.

Abstract: Currently, various uncertainty quantification methods have been proposed to
provide certainty and probability estimates for deep learning models' label
predictions. Meanwhile, with the growing demand for the right to be forgotten,
machine unlearning has been extensively studied as a means to remove the impact
of requested sensitive data from a pre-trained model without retraining the
model from scratch. However, the vulnerabilities of such generated predictive
uncertainties with regard to dedicated malicious unlearning attacks remain
unexplored. To bridge this gap, for the first time, we propose a new class of
malicious unlearning attacks against predictive uncertainties, where the
adversary aims to cause the desired manipulations of specific predictive
uncertainty results. We also design novel optimization frameworks for our
attacks and conduct extensive experiments, including black-box scenarios.
Notably, our extensive experiments show that our attacks are more effective in
manipulating predictive uncertainties than traditional attacks that focus on
label misclassifications, and existing defenses against conventional attacks
are ineffective against our attacks.

Conclusion: MOTGNN在预测准确性和解释性方面具有潜力，为多组学疾病建模提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Integrating multi-omics data, such as DNA methylation, mRNA expression, and
microRNA (miRNA) expression, offers a comprehensive view of the biological
mechanisms underlying disease. However, the high dimensionality and complex
interactions among omics layers present major challenges for predictive
modeling. We propose Multi-Omics integration with Tree-generated Graph Neural
Network (MOTGNN), a novel and interpretable framework for binary disease
classification. MOTGNN employs eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to perform
omics-specific supervised graph construction, followed by modality-specific
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for hierarchical representation learning, and a
deep feedforward network for cross-omics integration. On three real-world
disease datasets, MOTGNN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 5-10% in
accuracy, ROC-AUC, and F1-score, and remains robust to severe class imbalance
(e.g., 87.2% vs. 33.4% F1 on imbalanced data). The model maintains
computational efficiency through sparse graphs (2.1-2.8 edges per node) and
provides built-in interpretability, revealing both top-ranked biomarkers and
the relative contributions of each omics modality. These results highlight
MOTGNN's potential to improve both predictive accuracy and interpretability in
multi-omics disease modeling.

Motivation: 研究在梯度估计具有重尾分布（即仅有限p阶中心矩）时，经典OCO算法的性能，填补现有理论空白。

Method: 分析经典OCO算法（如在线梯度下降）在重尾梯度下的性能，无需额外操作（如梯度裁剪）。

Result: 证明了这些算法在重尾情况下仍能实现完全最优的遗憾界，且适用于非光滑非凸优化等场景。

Conclusion: 重尾OCO问题可通过经典算法有效解决，无需额外操作，结果具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: In Online Convex Optimization (OCO), when the stochastic gradient has a
finite variance, many algorithms provably work and guarantee a sublinear
regret. However, limited results are known if the gradient estimate has a heavy
tail, i.e., the stochastic gradient only admits a finite $\mathsf{p}$-th
central moment for some $\mathsf{p}\in\left(1,2\right]$. Motivated by it, this
work examines different old algorithms for OCO (e.g., Online Gradient Descent)
in the more challenging heavy-tailed setting. Under the standard bounded domain
assumption, we establish new regrets for these classical methods without any
algorithmic modification. Remarkably, these regret bounds are fully optimal in
all parameters (can be achieved even without knowing $\mathsf{p}$), suggesting
that OCO with heavy tails can be solved effectively without any extra operation
(e.g., gradient clipping). Our new results have several applications. A
particularly interesting one is the first provable convergence result for
nonsmooth nonconvex optimization under heavy-tailed noise without gradient
clipping. Furthermore, we explore broader settings (e.g., smooth OCO) and
extend our ideas to optimistic algorithms to handle different cases
simultaneously.

Motivation: 传统深度学习方法在时间序列预测中表现优异，但可解释性和适应性仍有提升空间。N-BEATS-MOE旨在通过MoE层增强模型的适应性和解释能力。

Method: N-BEATS-MOE在N-BEATS基础上引入MoE层，利用门控网络动态加权块，以更好地适应不同时间序列的特性。

Conclusion: N-BEATS-MOE通过MoE层提升了预测性能和可解释性，适用于复杂时间序列任务。

Abstract: Deep learning approaches are increasingly relevant for time series
forecasting tasks. Methods such as N-BEATS, which is built on stacks of
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) blocks, have achieved state-of-the-art results on
benchmark datasets and competitions. N-BEATS is also more interpretable
relative to other deep learning approaches, as it decomposes forecasts into
different time series components, such as trend and seasonality. In this work,
we present N-BEATS-MOE, an extension of N-BEATS based on a Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) layer. N-BEATS-MOE employs a dynamic block weighting strategy based on a
gating network which allows the model to better adapt to the characteristics of
each time series. We also hypothesize that the gating mechanism provides
additional interpretability by identifying which expert is most relevant for
each series. We evaluate our method across 12 benchmark datasets against
several approaches, achieving consistent improvements on several datasets,
especially those composed of heterogeneous time series.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DPMixSGD的隐私保护算法，用于解决非凸分散式最小-最大优化问题，确保隐私保护的同时不影响收敛性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分散式最小-最大优化中，模型更新共享可能泄露敏感数据，差分隐私（DP）虽能保护隐私，但噪声可能影响收敛，尤其是在非凸场景下。

Method: 基于STORM算法，提出DPMixSGD，通过添加噪声保护隐私，并证明噪声不影响收敛性能。

Result: 理论证明和实验验证表明，DPMixSGD在隐私保护和收敛性能上均表现优异。

Conclusion: DPMixSGD是一种有效的隐私保护算法，适用于非凸分散式最小-最大优化问题。

Abstract: Decentralized min-max optimization allows multi-agent systems to
collaboratively solve global min-max optimization problems by facilitating the
exchange of model updates among neighboring agents, eliminating the need for a
central server. However, sharing model updates in such systems carry a risk of
exposing sensitive data to inference attacks, raising significant privacy
concerns. To mitigate these privacy risks, differential privacy (DP) has become
a widely adopted technique for safeguarding individual data. Despite its
advantages, implementing DP in decentralized min-max optimization poses
challenges, as the added noise can hinder convergence, particularly in
non-convex scenarios with complex agent interactions in min-max optimization
problems. In this work, we propose an algorithm called DPMixSGD (Differential
Private Minmax Hybrid Stochastic Gradient Descent), a novel privacy-preserving
algorithm specifically designed for non-convex decentralized min-max
optimization. Our method builds on the state-of-the-art STORM-based algorithm,
one of the fastest decentralized min-max solutions. We rigorously prove that
the noise added to local gradients does not significantly compromise
convergence performance, and we provide theoretical bounds to ensure privacy
guarantees. To validate our theoretical findings, we conduct extensive
experiments across various tasks and models, demonstrating the effectiveness of
our approach.

Conclusion: FairDRL-ST为时空预测中的公平性问题提供了一种有效且性能损失小的解决方案。

Abstract: As deep spatio-temporal neural networks are increasingly utilised in urban
computing contexts, the deployment of such methods can have a direct impact on
users of critical urban infrastructure, such as public transport, emergency
services, and traffic management systems. While many spatio-temporal methods
focus on improving accuracy, fairness has recently gained attention due to
growing evidence that biased predictions in spatio-temporal applications can
disproportionately disadvantage certain demographic or geographic groups,
thereby reinforcing existing socioeconomic inequalities and undermining the
ethical deployment of AI in public services. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework, FairDRL-ST, based on disentangled representation learning, to
address fairness concerns in spatio-temporal prediction, with a particular
focus on mobility demand forecasting. By leveraging adversarial learning and
disentangled representation learning, our framework learns to separate
attributes that contain sensitive information. Unlike existing methods that
enforce fairness through supervised learning, which may lead to
overcompensation and degraded performance, our framework achieves fairness in
an unsupervised manner with minimal performance loss. We apply our framework to
real-world urban mobility datasets and demonstrate its ability to close
fairness gaps while delivering competitive predictive performance compared to
state-of-the-art fairness-aware methods.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable bearing fault classification is critical for
ensuring the reliability of rotating machinery, particularly under variable
operating conditions where domain shifts can significantly degrade model
performance. This study proposes a physics-informed multimodal convolutional
neural network (CNN) with a late fusion architecture, integrating vibration and
motor current signals alongside a dedicated physics-based feature extraction
branch. The model incorporates a novel physics-informed loss function that
penalizes physically implausible predictions based on characteristic bearing
fault frequencies - Ball Pass Frequency Outer (BPFO) and Ball Pass Frequency
Inner (BPFI) - derived from bearing geometry and shaft speed. Comprehensive
experiments on the Paderborn University dataset demonstrate that the proposed
physics-informed approach consistently outperforms a non-physics-informed
baseline, achieving higher accuracy, reduced false classifications, and
improved robustness across multiple data splits. To address performance
degradation under unseen operating conditions, three transfer learning (TL)
strategies - Target-Specific Fine-Tuning (TSFT), Layer-Wise Adaptation Strategy
(LAS), and Hybrid Feature Reuse (HFR) - are evaluated. Results show that LAS
yields the best generalization, with additional performance gains when combined
with physics-informed modeling. Validation on the KAIST bearing dataset
confirms the framework's cross-dataset applicability, achieving up to 98
percent accuracy. Statistical hypothesis testing further verifies significant
improvements (p < 0.01) in classification performance. The proposed framework
demonstrates the potential of integrating domain knowledge with data-driven
learning to achieve robust, interpretable, and generalizable fault diagnosis
for real-world industrial applications.

Result: 策略比轮询和随机策略减少推理误差达55%。

Conclusion: 优化面向任务的AoI函数可提升远程推理准确性。

Abstract: We consider a remote inference system with multiple modalities, where a
multimodal machine learning (ML) model performs real-time inference using
features collected from remote sensors. As sensor observations may change
dynamically over time, fresh features are critical for inference tasks.
However, timely delivering features from all modalities is often infeasible due
to limited network resources. To this end, we study a two-modality scheduling
problem to minimize the ML model's inference error, which is expressed as a
penalty function of AoI for both modalities. We develop an index-based
threshold policy and prove its optimality. Specifically, the scheduler switches
modalities when the current modality's index function exceeds a threshold. We
show that the two modalities share the same threshold, and both the index
functions and the threshold can be computed efficiently. The optimality of our
policy holds for (i) general AoI functions that are \emph{non-monotonic} and
\emph{non-additive} and (ii) \emph{heterogeneous} transmission times. Numerical
results show that our policy reduces inference error by up to 55% compared to
round-robin and uniform random policies, which are oblivious to the AoI-based
inference error function. Our results shed light on how to improve remote
inference accuracy by optimizing task-oriented AoI functions.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes
domains where reliability is paramount. This thesis investigates how
uncertainty estimation can enhance the safety and trustworthiness of ML,
focusing on selective prediction -- where models abstain when confidence is
low.
  We first show that a model's training trajectory contains rich uncertainty
signals that can be exploited without altering its architecture or loss. By
ensembling predictions from intermediate checkpoints, we propose a lightweight,
post-hoc abstention method that works across tasks, avoids the cost of deep
ensembles, and achieves state-of-the-art selective prediction performance.
Crucially, this approach is fully compatible with differential privacy (DP),
allowing us to study how privacy noise affects uncertainty quality. We find
that while many methods degrade under DP, our trajectory-based approach remains
robust, and we introduce a framework for isolating the privacy-uncertainty
trade-off. Next, we then develop a finite-sample decomposition of the selective
classification gap -- the deviation from the oracle accuracy-coverage curve --
identifying five interpretable error sources and clarifying which interventions
can close the gap. This explains why calibration alone cannot fix ranking
errors, motivating methods that improve uncertainty ordering. Finally, we show
that uncertainty signals can be adversarially manipulated to hide errors or
deny service while maintaining high accuracy, and we design defenses combining
calibration audits with verifiable inference.
  Together, these contributions advance reliable ML by improving, evaluating,
and safeguarding uncertainty estimation, enabling models that not only make
accurate predictions -- but also know when to say "I do not know".

provide detailed analyses of widely adopted inference techniques. Supported by
empirical results, our theoretical framework and analysis demonstrate the
potential for offering new insights into understanding inference behaviors in
real-world language models.

Abstract: A curious phenomenon observed in some dynamical generative models is the
following: despite learning errors in the score function or the drift vector
field, the generated samples appear to shift \emph{along} the support of the
data distribution but not \emph{away} from it. In this work, we investigate
this phenomenon of \emph{robustness of the support} by taking a dynamical
systems approach on the generating stochastic/deterministic process. Our
perturbation analysis of the probability flow reveals that infinitesimal
learning errors cause the predicted density to be different from the target
density only on the data manifold for a wide class of generative models.
Further, what is the dynamical mechanism that leads to the robustness of the
support? We show that the alignment of the top Lyapunov vectors (most sensitive
infinitesimal perturbation directions) with the tangent spaces along the
boundary of the data manifold leads to robustness and prove a sufficient
condition on the dynamics of the generating process to achieve this alignment.
Moreover, the alignment condition is efficient to compute and, in practice, for
robust generative models, automatically leads to accurate estimates of the
tangent bundle of the data manifold. Using a finite-time linear perturbation
analysis on samples paths as well as probability flows, our work complements
and extends existing works on obtaining theoretical guarantees for generative
models from a stochastic analysis, statistical learning and uncertainty
quantification points of view. Our results apply across different dynamical
generative models, such as conditional flow-matching and score-based generative
models, and for different target distributions that may or may not satisfy the
manifold hypothesis.

Abstract: We present Klear-Reasoner, a model with long reasoning capabilities that
demonstrates careful deliberation during problem solving, achieving outstanding
performance across multiple benchmarks. Although there are already many
excellent works related to inference models in the current community, there are
still many problems with reproducing high-performance inference models due to
incomplete disclosure of training details. This report provides an in-depth
analysis of the reasoning model, covering the entire post-training workflow
from data preparation and long Chain-of-Thought supervised fine-tuning (long
CoT SFT) to reinforcement learning (RL), along with detailed ablation studies
for each experimental component. For SFT data, our experiments show that a
small number of high-quality data sources are more effective than a large
number of diverse data sources, and that difficult samples can achieve better
results without accuracy filtering. In addition, we investigate two key issues
with current clipping mechanisms in RL: Clipping suppresses critical
exploration signals and ignores suboptimal trajectories. To address these
challenges, we propose Gradient-Preserving clipping Policy Optimization (GPPO)
that gently backpropagates gradients from clipped tokens. GPPO not only
enhances the model's exploration capacity but also improves its efficiency in
learning from negative samples. Klear-Reasoner exhibits exceptional reasoning
abilities in mathematics and programming, scoring 90.5\% on AIME 2024, 83.2\%
on AIME 2025, 66.0\% on LiveCodeBench V5 and 58.1\% on LiveCodeBench V6.

Abstract: We study the problem of posterior sampling in the context of score based
generative models. We have a trained score network for a prior $p(x)$, a
measurement model $p(y|x)$, and are tasked with sampling from the posterior
$p(x|y)$. Prior work has shown this to be intractable in KL (in the worst case)
under well-accepted computational hardness assumptions. Despite this, popular
algorithms for tasks such as image super-resolution, stylization, and
reconstruction enjoy empirical success. Rather than establishing distributional
assumptions or restricted settings under which exact posterior sampling is
tractable, we view this as a more general "tilting" problem of biasing a
distribution towards a measurement. Under minimal assumptions, we show that one
can tractably sample from a distribution that is simultaneously close to the
posterior of a noised prior in KL divergence and the true posterior in Fisher
divergence. Intuitively, this combination ensures that the resulting sample is
consistent with both the measurement and the prior. To the best of our
knowledge these are the first formal results for (approximate) posterior
sampling in polynomial time.

Abstract: Attribution explanation is a typical approach for explaining deep neural
networks (DNNs), inferring an importance or contribution score for each input
variable to the final output. In recent years, numerous attribution methods
have been developed to explain DNNs. However, a persistent concern remains
unresolved, i.e., whether and which attribution methods faithfully reflect the
actual contribution of input variables to the decision-making process. The
faithfulness issue undermines the reliability and practical utility of
attribution explanations. We argue that these concerns stem from three core
challenges. First, difficulties arise in comparing attribution methods due to
their unstructured heterogeneity, differences in heuristics, formulations, and
implementations that lack a unified organization. Second, most methods lack
solid theoretical underpinnings, with their rationales remaining absent,
ambiguous, or unverified. Third, empirically evaluating faithfulness is
challenging without ground truth. Recent theoretical advances provide a
promising way to tackle these challenges, attracting increasing attention. We
summarize these developments, with emphasis on three key directions: (i)
Theoretical unification, which uncovers commonalities and differences among
methods, enabling systematic comparisons; (ii) Theoretical rationale,
clarifying the foundations of existing methods; (iii) Theoretical evaluation,
rigorously proving whether methods satisfy faithfulness principles. Beyond a
comprehensive review, we provide insights into how these studies help deepen
theoretical understanding, inform method selection, and inspire new attribution
methods. We conclude with a discussion of promising open problems for further
work.

scientific data. In this paper, we introduce the first framework to directly
extract complex topological features -- contours, Jacobi sets, and ridge-valley
graphs -- from a type of continuous implicit model known as multivariate
functional approximation (MFA). MFA replaces discrete data with continuous
piecewise smooth functions. Given an MFA model as the input, our approach
enables direct extraction of complex topological features from the model,
without reverting to a discrete representation of the model. Our work is easily
generalizable to any continuous implicit model that supports the queries of
function values and high-order derivatives. Our work establishes the building
blocks for performing topological data analysis and visualization on implicit
continuous models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种数据选择方法（DMPO），通过量化偏好冲突（PD）来选择高共识数据，以优化LLM对齐效果，提升训练效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如DPO）在处理多源偏好数据时难以应对噪声和冲突，需要更有效的数据选择策略。

Method: 提出DMPO目标，利用PD项量化偏好冲突，并基于此设计数据选择原则，选择高共识数据用于训练。

Result: 在UltraFeedback数据集上，该方法相对标准方法提升10%以上，同时提高训练效率。

Conclusion: 通过量化偏好冲突选择数据，可有效提升LLM对齐效果，避免复杂标注需求。

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with diverse human values requires
moving beyond a single holistic "better-than" preference criterion. While
collecting fine-grained, aspect-specific preference data is more reliable and
scalable, existing methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) struggle
with the severe noise and conflicts inherent in such aggregated datasets. In
this paper, we tackle this challenge from a data-centric perspective. We first
derive the Direct Multi-Preference Optimization (DMPO) objective, and uncover a
key Preference Divergence (PD) term that quantifies inter-aspect preference
conflicts. Instead of using this term for direct optimization, we leverage it
to formulate a novel, theoretically-grounded data selection principle. Our
principle advocates for selecting a subset of high-consensus data-identified by
the most negative PD values-for efficient DPO training. We prove the optimality
of this strategy by analyzing the loss bounds of the DMPO objective in the
selection problem. To operationalize our approach, we introduce practical
methods of PD term estimation and length bias mitigation, thereby proposing our
PD selection method. Evaluation on the UltraFeedback dataset with three varying
conflict levels shows that our simple yet effective strategy achieves over 10%
relative improvement against both the standard holistic preference and a
stronger oracle using aggregated preference signals, all while boosting
training efficiency and obviating the need for intractable holistic preference
annotating, unlocking the potential of robust LLM alignment via fine-grained
preference signals.

Result: 多轮攻击成功率与单轮攻击重复采样相当；攻击成功率在相似模型间相关；高推理努力可能导致更高成功率。

Conclusion: 多轮越狱攻击的复杂性被高估，结果对AI安全评估和防御系统设计有重要启示。

Abstract: While defenses against single-turn jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models
(LLMs) have improved significantly, multi-turn jailbreaks remain a persistent
vulnerability, often achieving success rates exceeding 70% against models
optimized for single-turn protection. This work presents an empirical analysis
of automated multi-turn jailbreak attacks across state-of-the-art models
including GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini variants, using the StrongREJECT benchmark.
Our findings challenge the perceived sophistication of multi-turn attacks: when
accounting for the attacker's ability to learn from how models refuse harmful
requests, multi-turn jailbreaking approaches are approximately equivalent to
simply resampling single-turn attacks multiple times. Moreover, attack success
is correlated among similar models, making it easier to jailbreak newly
released ones. Additionally, for reasoning models, we find surprisingly that
higher reasoning effort often leads to higher attack success rates. Our results
have important implications for AI safety evaluation and the design of
jailbreak-resistant systems. We release the source code at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值天气预报（NWP）系统在固定网格点上预测大气状态，但观测数据位置不固定，导致空间相关性复杂且动态变化。

Method: 采用带结构学习的STGNN，并通过自适应节点度调节和空间距离考虑解决结构信息丢失和过平滑问题。

Result: 在东亚真实数据验证中，该方法在高变异性区域表现优于现有STGNN模型。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了动态空间相关性问题，提升了预测精度。

Abstract: This study aims to discover spatial correlations between Earth observations
and atmospheric states to improve the forecasting accuracy of global
atmospheric state estimation, which are usually conducted using conventional
numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems and is the beginning of weather
forecasting. NWP systems predict future atmospheric states at fixed locations,
which are called NWP grid points, by analyzing previous atmospheric states and
newly acquired Earth observations without fixed locations. Thus, surrounding
meteorological context and the changing locations of the observations make
spatial correlations between atmospheric states and observations over time. To
handle complicated spatial correlations, which change dynamically, we employ
spatiotemporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) with structure learning. However,
structure learning has an inherent limitation that this can cause structural
information loss and over-smoothing problem by generating excessive edges. To
solve this problem, we regulate edge sampling by adaptively determining node
degrees and considering the spatial distances between NWP grid points and
observations. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method by using
real-world atmospheric state and observation data from East Asia. Even in areas
with high atmospheric variability, the proposed method outperformed existing
STGNN models with and without structure learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI系统需要高效、准确的分类方法，且需适应动态变化的用户需求。现有方法如生成式LLM、交叉编码器和嵌入方法各有不足。

Method: 提出GLiClass方法，基于GLiNER架构，并采用近端策略优化（PPO）进行多标签文本分类训练。

Result: GLiClass在准确性和效率上表现优异，适用于零样本和小样本学习。

Conclusion: GLiClass为分类任务提供了一种高效、灵活且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Classification is one of the most widespread tasks in AI applications,
serving often as the first step in filtering, sorting, and categorizing data.
Since modern AI systems must handle large volumes of input data and early
pipeline stages can propagate errors downstream, achieving high efficiency and
accuracy is critical. Moreover, classification requirements can change
dynamically based on user needs, necessitating models with strong zero-shot
capabilities. While generative LLMs have become mainstream for zero-shot
classification due to their versatility, they suffer from inconsistent
instruction following and computational inefficiency. Cross-encoders, commonly
used as rerankers in RAG pipelines, face a different bottleneck: they must
process text-label pairs sequentially, significantly reducing efficiency with
large label sets. Embedding-based approaches offer good efficiency but struggle
with complex scenarios involving logical and semantic constraints. We propose
GLiClass, a novel method that adapts the GLiNER architecture for sequence
classification tasks. Our approach achieves strong accuracy and efficiency
comparable to embedding-based methods, while maintaining the flexibility needed
for zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios. Additionally, we adapted
proximal policy optimization (PPO) for multi-label text classification,
enabling training classifiers in data-sparse conditions or from human feedback.

Conclusion: AIS-LLM为海事交通管理提供了更智能高效的解决方案。

Abstract: With the increase in maritime traffic and the mandatory implementation of the
Automatic Identification System (AIS), the importance and diversity of maritime
traffic analysis tasks based on AIS data, such as vessel trajectory prediction,
anomaly detection, and collision risk assessment, is rapidly growing. However,
existing approaches tend to address these tasks individually, making it
difficult to holistically consider complex maritime situations. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel framework, AIS-LLM, which integrates time-series
AIS data with a large language model (LLM). AIS-LLM consists of a Time-Series
Encoder for processing AIS sequences, an LLM-based Prompt Encoder, a
Cross-Modality Alignment Module for semantic alignment between time-series data
and textual prompts, and an LLM-based Multi-Task Decoder. This architecture
enables the simultaneous execution of three key tasks: trajectory prediction,
anomaly detection, and risk assessment of vessel collisions within a single
end-to-end system. Experimental results demonstrate that AIS-LLM outperforms
existing methods across individual tasks, validating its effectiveness.
Furthermore, by integratively analyzing task outputs to generate situation
summaries and briefings, AIS-LLM presents the potential for more intelligent
and efficient maritime traffic management.

Result: 在合成数据集上验证，算法性能优于或匹配基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为语义缓存提供了理论基础，并展示了实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing how users interact with
information systems, yet their high inference cost poses serious scalability
and sustainability challenges. Caching inference responses, allowing them to be
retrieved without another forward pass through the LLM, has emerged as one
possible solution. Traditional exact-match caching, however, overlooks the
semantic similarity between queries, leading to unnecessary recomputation.
Semantic caching addresses this by retrieving responses based on semantic
similarity, but introduces a fundamentally different cache eviction problem:
one must account for mismatch costs between incoming queries and cached
responses. Moreover, key system parameters, such as query arrival probabilities
and serving costs, are often unknown and must be learned over time. Existing
semantic caching methods are largely ad-hoc, lacking theoretical foundations
and unable to adapt to real-world uncertainty. In this paper, we present a
principled, learning-based framework for semantic cache eviction under unknown
query and cost distributions. We formulate both offline optimization and online
learning variants of the problem, and develop provably efficient algorithms
with state-of-the-art guarantees. We also evaluate our framework on a synthetic
dataset, showing that our proposed algorithms perform matching or superior
performance compared with baselines.

Abstract: Sepsis, a life-threatening inflammatory response to infection, causes organ
dysfunction, making early detection and optimal management critical. Previous
reinforcement learning (RL) approaches to sepsis management rely primarily on
structured data, such as lab results or vital signs, and on a dearth of a
comprehensive understanding of the patient's condition. In this work, we
propose a Multimodal Offline REinforcement learning for Clinical notes
Leveraged Enhanced stAte Representation (MORE-CLEAR) framework for sepsis
control in intensive care units. MORE-CLEAR employs pre-trained large-scale
language models (LLMs) to facilitate the extraction of rich semantic
representations from clinical notes, preserving clinical context and improving
patient state representation. Gated fusion and cross-modal attention allow
dynamic weight adjustment in the context of time and the effective integration
of multimodal data. Extensive cross-validation using two public (MIMIC-III and
MIMIC-IV) and one private dataset demonstrates that MORE-CLEAR significantly
improves estimated survival rate and policy performance compared to
single-modal RL approaches. To our knowledge, this is the first to leverage LLM
capabilities within a multimodal offline RL for better state representation in
medical applications. This approach can potentially expedite the treatment and
management of sepsis by enabling reinforcement learning models to propose
enhanced actions based on a more comprehensive understanding of patient
conditions.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a significant role in finance, energy,
meteorology, and IoT applications. Recent studies have leveraged the
generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to adapt to time
series forecasting, achieving promising performance. However, existing studies
focus on token-level modal alignment, instead of bridging the intrinsic
modality gap between linguistic knowledge structures and time series data
patterns, greatly limiting the semantic representation. To address this issue,
we propose a novel Semantic-Enhanced LLM (SE-LLM) that explores the inherent
periodicity and anomalous characteristics of time series to embed into the
semantic space to enhance the token embedding. This process enhances the
interpretability of tokens for LLMs, thereby activating the potential of LLMs
for temporal sequence analysis. Moreover, existing Transformer-based LLMs excel
at capturing long-range dependencies but are weak at modeling short-term
anomalies in time-series data. Hence, we propose a plugin module embedded
within self-attention that models long-term and short-term dependencies to
effectively adapt LLMs to time-series analysis. Our approach freezes the LLM
and reduces the sequence dimensionality of tokens, greatly reducing
computational consumption. Experiments demonstrate the superiority performance
of our SE-LLM against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Abstract: The increasing demand for computational resources of training neural networks
leads to a concerning growth in energy consumption. While parallelization has
enabled upscaling model and dataset sizes and accelerated training, its impact
on energy consumption is often overlooked. To close this research gap, we
conducted scaling experiments for data-parallel training of two models,
ResNet50 and FourCastNet, and evaluated the impact of parallelization
parameters, i.e., GPU count, global batch size, and local batch size, on
predictive performance, training time, and energy consumption. We show that
energy consumption scales approximately linearly with the consumed resources,
i.e., GPU hours; however, the respective scaling factor differs substantially
between distinct model trainings and hardware, and is systematically influenced
by the number of samples and gradient updates per GPU hour. Our results shed
light on the complex interplay of scaling up neural network training and can
inform future developments towards more sustainable AI research.

Result: 在CV、NLU、NLG任务及主流Transformer架构上实现近乎无损的转换精度，延迟显著降低。

Conclusion: 为Spiking Transformer的高效部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Leveraging the event-driven paradigm, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a
promising approach for constructing energy-efficient Transformer architectures.
Compared to directly trained Spiking Transformers, ANN-to-SNN conversion
methods bypass the high training costs. However, existing methods still suffer
from notable limitations, failing to effectively handle nonlinear operations in
Transformer architectures and requiring additional fine-tuning processes for
pre-trained ANNs. To address these issues, we propose a high-performance and
training-free ANN-to-SNN conversion framework tailored for Transformer
architectures. Specifically, we introduce a Multi-basis Exponential Decay (MBE)
neuron, which employs an exponential decay strategy and multi-basis encoding
method to efficiently approximate various nonlinear operations. It removes the
requirement for weight modifications in pre-trained ANNs. Extensive experiments
across diverse tasks (CV, NLU, NLG) and mainstream Transformer architectures
(ViT, RoBERTa, GPT-2) demonstrate that our method achieves near-lossless
conversion accuracy with significantly lower latency. This provides a promising
pathway for the efficient and scalable deployment of Spiking Transformers in
real-world applications.

Motivation: 现实数据常受标签噪声和输入噪声影响，而深度网络会记忆错误标签，因此需有效筛选高质量数据。

Result: 在MNIST上验证，高互信息样本训练使分类准确率提升15%，且对良性输入修改鲁棒。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效过滤低质量样本，提升模型性能，适用于混合噪声场景。

Abstract: Deep neural networks can memorize corrupted labels, making data quality
critical for model performance, yet real-world datasets are frequently
compromised by both label noise and input noise. This paper proposes a mutual
information-based framework for data selection under hybrid noise scenarios
that quantifies statistical dependencies between inputs and labels. We compute
each sample's pointwise contribution to the overall mutual information and find
that lower contributions indicate noisy or mislabeled instances. Empirical
validation on MNIST with different synthetic noise settings demonstrates that
the method effectively filters low-quality samples. Under label corruption,
training on high-MI samples improves classification accuracy by up to 15\%
compared to random sampling. Furthermore, the method exhibits robustness to
benign input modifications, preserving semantically valid data while filtering
truly corrupted samples.

Conclusion: HR3L为在非理想通信条件下训练RL代理提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of training Reinforcement Learning (RL)
agents over communication networks. The RL paradigm requires the agent to
instantaneously perceive the state evolution to infer the effects of its
actions on the environment. This is impossible if the agent receives state
updates over lossy or delayed wireless systems and thus operates with partial
and intermittent information. In recent years, numerous frameworks have been
proposed to manage RL with imperfect feedback; however, they often offer
specific solutions with a substantial computational burden. To address these
limits, we propose a novel architecture, named Homomorphic Robust Remote
Reinforcement Learning (HR3L), that enables the training of remote RL agents
exchanging observations across a non-ideal wireless channel. HR3L considers two
units: the transmitter, which encodes meaningful representations of the
environment, and the receiver, which decodes these messages and performs
actions to maximize a reward signal. Importantly, HR3L does not require the
exchange of gradient information across the wireless channel, allowing for
quicker training and a lower communication overhead than state-of-the-art
solutions. Experimental results demonstrate that HR3L significantly outperforms
baseline methods in terms of sample efficiency and adapts to different
communication scenarios, including packet losses, delayed transmissions, and
capacity limitations.

Conclusion: TRGE通过动态扩展和路由策略，有效缓解了多领域持续学习中的遗忘问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Multi-Domain Continual Learning (MDCL) acquires knowledge from sequential
tasks with shifting class sets and distribution. Despite the
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods can adapt for this dual
heterogeneity, they still suffer from catastrophic forgetting and forward
forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose a Two-Level Routing Grouped
Mixture-of-Experts (TRGE) method. Firstly, TRGE dynamically expands the
pre-trained CLIP model, assigning specific expert group for each task to
mitigate catastrophic forgetting. With the number of experts continually grows
in this process, TRGE maintains the static experts count within the group and
introduces the intra-group router to alleviate routing overfitting caused by
the increasing routing complexity. Meanwhile, we design an inter-group routing
policy based on task identifiers and task prototype distance, which dynamically
selects relevant expert groups and combines their outputs to enhance inter-task
collaboration. Secondly, to get the correct task identifiers, we leverage
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) which own powerful multimodal
comprehension capabilities to generate semantic task descriptions and recognize
the correct task identifier. Finally, to mitigate forward forgetting, we
dynamically fuse outputs for unseen samples from the frozen CLIP model and TRGE
adapter based on training progress, leveraging both pre-trained and learned
knowledge. Through extensive experiments across various settings, our method
outperforms other advanced methods with fewer trainable parameters.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to optimize the return given a fixed
dataset of agent trajectories without additional interactions with the
environment. While algorithm development has progressed rapidly, significant
theoretical advances have also been made in understanding the fundamental
challenges of offline RL. However, bridging these theoretical insights with
practical algorithm design remains an ongoing challenge. In this survey, we
explore key intuitions derived from theoretical work and their implications for
offline RL algorithms.
  We begin by listing the conditions needed for the proofs, including function
representation and data coverage assumptions. Function representation
conditions tell us what to expect for generalization, and data coverage
assumptions describe the quality requirement of the data. We then examine
counterexamples, where offline RL is not solvable without an impractically
large amount of data. These cases highlight what cannot be achieved for all
algorithms and the inherent hardness of offline RL. Building on techniques to
mitigate these challenges, we discuss the conditions that are sufficient for
offline RL. These conditions are not merely assumptions for theoretical proofs,
but they also reveal the limitations of these algorithms and remind us to
search for novel solutions when the conditions cannot be satisfied.

accelerates convergence through direct token-level loss intervention, its
efficacy is constrained by offline policy trajectory. In contrast,
RL(reinforcement learning) facilitates exploratory policy optimization, but
suffers from low sample efficiency and stringent dependency on high-quality
base models. To address these dual challenges, we propose GRAO (Group Relative
Alignment Optimization), a unified framework that synergizes the respective
strengths of SFT and RL through three key innovations: 1) A multi-sample
generation strategy enabling comparative quality assessment via reward
feedback; 2) A novel Group Direct Alignment Loss formulation leveraging
intra-group relative advantage weighting; 3) Reference-aware parameter updates
guided by pairwise preference dynamics. Our theoretical analysis establishes
GRAO's convergence guarantees and sample efficiency advantages over
conventional approaches. Comprehensive evaluations across complex human
alignment tasks demonstrate GRAO's superior performance, achieving
57.70\%,17.65\% 7.95\% and 5.18\% relative improvements over SFT, DPO, PPO and
GRPO baselines respectively. This work provides both a theoretically grounded
alignment framework and empirical evidence for efficient capability evolution
in language models.

*Martin Rektoris,Milan Papež,Václav Šmídl,Tomáš Pevný*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种稀疏概率图电路（SPGCs），解决了现有概率图电路（PGCs）在稠密图表示中复杂度高的问题，通过稀疏表示将复杂度从O(n²)降至O(n+m)，并在药物设计中验证了其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度生成模型（DGMs）因非线性特性导致概率推断难以解析计算，而PGCs虽解决了这一问题，但其稠密图表示的高复杂度（O(n²)）限制了可扩展性。

Method: 提出稀疏概率图电路（SPGCs），直接在稀疏图表示上操作，将复杂度降至O(n+m)，适用于边数远小于节点数平方的图。

Result: 实验证明SPGCs在药物设计中保持了精确推断能力，提高了内存效率和推断速度，并在关键指标上匹配了不可解DGMs的性能。

Conclusion: SPGCs通过稀疏表示显著提升了可扩展性，同时保持了精确推断能力，为高效图生成模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: Deep generative models (DGMs) for graphs achieve impressively high expressive
power thanks to very efficient and scalable neural networks. However, these
networks contain non-linearities that prevent analytical computation of many
standard probabilistic inference queries, i.e., these DGMs are considered
\emph{intractable}. While recently proposed Probabilistic Graph Circuits (PGCs)
address this issue by enabling \emph{tractable} probabilistic inference, they
operate on dense graph representations with $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ complexity for
graphs with $n$ nodes and \emph{$m$ edges}. To address this scalability issue,
we introduce Sparse PGCs, a new class of tractable generative models that
operate directly on sparse graph representation, reducing the complexity to
$\mathcal{O}(n + m)$, which is particularly beneficial for $m \ll n^2$. In the
context of de novo drug design, we empirically demonstrate that SPGCs retain
exact inference capabilities, improve memory efficiency and inference speed,
and match the performance of intractable DGMs in key metrics.

*Qiang He,Setareh Maghsudi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PAMA的高效多目标对齐算法，用于解决大语言模型在现实应用中多目标冲突的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于RLHF的对齐方法只能优化单一奖励函数，导致模型行为僵化，无法适应多样的人类偏好，限制了模型的实用性。

Method: PAMA将多目标强化学习转化为凸优化问题，提供闭式解，显著降低了计算复杂度（从O(n^2*d)降至O(n)）。

Result: 实验证明PAMA在125M至7B参数的语言模型中表现稳健高效，能够收敛到帕累托稳定点。

Conclusion: PAMA为多目标对齐问题提供了高效且理论可行的解决方案，为AI在现实中的多样化应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications that require careful balancing of multiple, often conflicting,
objectives, such as informativeness versus conciseness, or helpfulness versus
creativity. However, current alignment methods, primarily based on RLHF,
optimize LLMs toward a single reward function, resulting in rigid behavior that
fails to capture the complexity and diversity of human preferences. This
limitation hinders the adaptability of LLMs to practical scenarios, making
multi-objective alignment (MOA) a critical yet underexplored area. To bridge
this gap, we propose Pareto Multi-Objective Alignment (PAMA), a principled and
computationally efficient algorithm designed explicitly for MOA in LLMs. In
contrast to computationally prohibitive multi-objective optimization (MOO)
methods, PAMA transforms multi-objective RLHF into a convex optimization with a
closed-form solution, significantly enhancing scalability. Traditional MOO
approaches suffer from prohibitive O(n^2*d) complexity, where d represents the
number of model parameters, typically in the billions for LLMs, rendering
direct optimization infeasible. PAMA reduces this complexity to O(n) where n is
the number of objectives, enabling optimization to be completed within
milliseconds. We provide theoretical guarantees that PAMA converges to a Pareto
stationary point, where no objective can be improved without degrading at least
one other. Extensive experiments across language models ranging from 125M to 7B
parameters demonstrate PAMA's robust and effective MOA capabilities, aligning
with its theoretical advantages. PAMA provides a highly efficient solution to
the MOA problem that was previously considered intractable, offering a
practical and theoretically grounded approach to aligning LLMs with diverse
human values, paving the way for versatile and adaptable real-world AI
deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖更强的LLM或过滤难题，限制了可扩展性和推理能力的提升。

Result: 实验表明，EvoCoT能解决未解决问题，提升推理能力，且兼容多种RL微调方法。

Conclusion: EvoCoT为稀疏奖励下的LLM推理优化提供了有效解决方案，并开源代码以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) has become a promising
paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs) to improve their
reasoning capability. However, when the rollout accuracy is low on hard
problems, the reward becomes sparse, limiting learning efficiency and causing
exploration bottlenecks. Existing approaches either rely on stronger LLMs for
distillation or filter out difficult problems, which limits scalability or
restricts reasoning improvement through exploration.
  We propose EvoCoT, a self-evolving curriculum learning framework based on
two-stage chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning optimization. EvoCoT constrains the
exploration space by self-generating and verifying CoT trajectories, then
gradually shortens them to expand the space in a controlled way. This enables
LLMs to stably learn from initially unsolved hard problems under sparse
rewards. We apply EvoCoT to multiple LLM families, including Qwen, DeepSeek,
and Llama. Experiments show that EvoCoT enables LLMs to solve previously
unsolved problems, improves reasoning capability without external CoT
supervision, and is compatible with various RL fine-tuning methods. We release
the source code to support future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PPM技术需要大量事件数据或其他资源，限制了部分组织的应用。本文旨在解决这一问题，使资源有限的组织也能利用PPM。

Method: 提出了一种基于迁移学习的PPM技术，通过将知识从一个业务过程迁移到类似过程（同一或不同组织），实现目标环境中的有效PPM。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在跨组织环境中能够成功迁移知识，支持有效的PPM。

Conclusion: 该技术为组织提供了一种在资源有限情况下实现PPM的可行方案，尤其在跨组织环境中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Event logs reflect the behavior of business processes that are mapped in
organizational information systems. Predictive process monitoring (PPM)
transforms these data into value by creating process-related predictions that
provide the insights required for proactive interventions at process runtime.
Existing PPM techniques require sufficient amounts of event data or other
relevant resources that might not be readily available, preventing some
organizations from utilizing PPM. The transfer learning-based PPM technique
presented in this paper allows organizations without suitable event data or
other relevant resources to implement PPM for effective decision support. The
technique is instantiated in two real-life use cases, based on which numerical
experiments are performed using event logs for IT service management processes
in an intra- and inter-organizational setting. The results of the experiments
suggest that knowledge of one business process can be transferred to a similar
business process in the same or a different organization to enable effective
PPM in the target context. With the proposed technique, organizations can
benefit from transfer learning in an intra- and inter-organizational setting,
where resources like pre-trained models are transferred within and across
organizational boundaries.

Motivation: 在物理模型不完整或计算成本高的情况下，机器学习提供了一种灵活替代方案，但纯数据驱动模型在泛化和稳定性上存在不足。

Method: 采用Real NVP神经网络架构和自注意力机制，结合物理信息训练策略，与纯数据驱动基线进行比较。

Result: 物理信息模型的平均相对误差降低了27.08%，在MPC框架中控制精度和鲁棒性提升最高达42.86%。

Conclusion: 物理信息的引入显著提升了模型性能，尤其在控制精度和鲁棒性方面表现优异。

Abstract: Attitude control is a fundamental aspect of spacecraft operations. Model
Predictive Control (MPC) has emerged as a powerful strategy for these tasks,
relying on accurate models of the system dynamics to optimize control actions
over a prediction horizon. In scenarios where physics models are incomplete,
difficult to derive, or computationally expensive, machine learning offers a
flexible alternative by learning the system behavior directly from data.
However, purely data-driven models often struggle with generalization and
stability, especially when applied to inputs outside their training domain. To
address these limitations, we investigate the benefits of incorporating
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) into the learning of spacecraft
attitude dynamics, comparing their performance with that of purely data-driven
approaches. Using a Real-valued Non-Volume Preserving (Real NVP) neural network
architecture with a self-attention mechanism, we trained several models on
simulated data generated with the Basilisk simulator. Two training strategies
were considered: a purely data-driven baseline and a physics-informed variant
to improve robustness and stability. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion
of physics-based information significantly enhances the performance in terms of
the mean relative error of the best architectures found by 27.08%. These
advantages are particularly evident when the learned models are integrated into
an MPC framework, where PINN-based models consistently outperform their purely
data-driven counterparts in terms of control accuracy and robustness, yielding
improvements of up to 42.86% in performance stability error and increased
robustness-to-noise.

Motivation: 探讨模拟器在科学实验中的价值，并评估Centaur作为参与者模拟器的潜力，以推动自动化认知科学的发展。

Method: 回顾参与者模拟器的核心标准，并分析Centaur（基于人类实验数据微调的大型语言模型）在这些标准上的表现。

Result: Centaur在预测准确性上表现优异，但其生成行为与人类数据不一致，未能完全满足参与者模拟器的标准。

Conclusion: Centaur是预测人类行为的重要进展，但尚未达到可靠参与者模拟器或准确认知模型的标准。

Abstract: Simulators have revolutionized scientific practice across the natural
sciences. By generating data that reliably approximate real-world phenomena,
they enable scientists to accelerate hypothesis testing and optimize
experimental designs. This is perhaps best illustrated by AlphaFold, a
Nobel-prize winning simulator in chemistry that predicts protein structures
from amino acid sequences, enabling rapid prototyping of molecular
interactions, drug targets, and protein functions. In the behavioral sciences,
a reliable participant simulator - a system capable of producing human-like
behavior across cognitive tasks - would represent a similarly transformative
advance. Recently, Binz et al. introduced Centaur, a large language model (LLM)
fine-tuned on human data from 160 experiments, proposing its use not only as a
model of cognition but also as a participant simulator for "in silico
prototyping of experimental studies", e.g., to advance automated cognitive
science. Here, we review the core criteria for a participant simulator and
assess how well Centaur meets them. Although Centaur demonstrates strong
predictive accuracy, its generative behavior - a critical criterion for a
participant simulator - systematically diverges from human data. This suggests
that, while Centaur is a significant step toward predicting human behavior, it
does not yet meet the standards of a reliable participant simulator or an
accurate model of cognition.

Motivation: 扩散模型在生成建模中表现优异，但在数据有限时易过拟合，需针对性解决方案。

Method: 提出ScoreAug框架，对噪声数据应用变换，要求降噪器预测原始目标的增强，实现分数增强。

Result: 在CIFAR-10等基准测试中显著提升性能，有效缓解过拟合，且与传统增强方法结合效果更佳。

Conclusion: ScoreAug为扩散模型提供了一种高效的数据增强方法，解决了过拟合问题并提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative modeling.
However, this study confirms the existence of overfitting in diffusion model
training, particularly in data-limited regimes. To address this challenge, we
propose Score Augmentation (ScoreAug), a novel data augmentation framework
specifically designed for diffusion models. Unlike conventional augmentation
approaches that operate on clean data, ScoreAug applies transformations to
noisy data, aligning with the inherent denoising mechanism of diffusion.
Crucially, ScoreAug further requires the denoiser to predict the augmentation
of the original target. This design establishes an equivariant learning
objective, enabling the denoiser to learn scores across varied denoising
spaces, thereby realizing what we term score augmentation. We also
theoretically analyze the relationship between scores in different spaces under
general transformations. In experiments, we extensively validate ScoreAug on
multiple benchmarks including CIFAR-10, FFHQ, AFHQv2, and ImageNet, with
results demonstrating significant performance improvements over baselines.
Notably, ScoreAug effectively mitigates overfitting across diverse scenarios,
such as varying data scales and model capacities, while exhibiting stable
convergence properties. Another advantage of ScoreAug over standard data
augmentation lies in its ability to circumvent data leakage issues under
certain conditions. Furthermore, we show that ScoreAug can be synergistically
combined with traditional data augmentation techniques to achieve additional
performance gains.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning for LLM reasoning has rapidly emerged as a prominent
research area, marked by a significant surge in related studies on both
algorithmic innovations and practical applications. Despite this progress,
several critical challenges remain, including the absence of standardized
guidelines for employing RL techniques and a fragmented understanding of their
underlying mechanisms. Additionally, inconsistent experimental settings,
variations in training data, and differences in model initialization have led
to conflicting conclusions, obscuring the key characteristics of these
techniques and creating confusion among practitioners when selecting
appropriate techniques. This paper systematically reviews widely adopted RL
techniques through rigorous reproductions and isolated evaluations within a
unified open-source framework. We analyze the internal mechanisms, applicable
scenarios, and core principles of each technique through fine-grained
experiments, including datasets of varying difficulty, model sizes, and
architectures. Based on these insights, we present clear guidelines for
selecting RL techniques tailored to specific setups, and provide a reliable
roadmap for practitioners navigating the RL for the LLM domain. Finally, we
reveal that a minimalist combination of two techniques can unlock the learning
capability of critic-free policies using vanilla PPO loss. The results
demonstrate that our simple combination consistently improves performance,
surpassing strategies like GRPO and DAPO.

Abstract: Time series forecasting poses significant challenges in non-stationary
environments where underlying patterns evolve over time. In this work, we
propose a novel framework that enhances deep neural network (DNN) performance
by leveraging specialized model adaptation and selection. Initially, a base DNN
is trained offline on historical time series data. A reserved validation subset
is then segmented to extract and cluster the most dominant patterns within the
series, thereby identifying distinct regimes. For each identified cluster, the
base DNN is fine-tuned to produce a specialized version that captures unique
pattern characteristics. At inference, the most recent input is matched against
the cluster centroids, and the corresponding fine-tuned version is deployed
based on the closest similarity measure. Additionally, our approach integrates
a concept drift detection mechanism to identify and adapt to emerging patterns
caused by non-stationary behavior. The proposed framework is generalizable
across various DNN architectures and has demonstrated significant performance
gains on both traditional DNNs and recent advanced architectures implemented in
the GluonTS library.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类算法假设所有特征对数据结构的贡献均等，但在高维或噪声场景下不成立。现有特征加权方法需额外调参。

Method: 利用Shapley值量化特征相关性，将k-means目标分解为各特征的Shapley值之和，迭代调整特征权重。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，SHARK表现优于现有方法，尤其在噪声场景下具有更高的鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: SHARK为无监督特征相关性提供了理论基础，并在实际应用中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Clustering algorithms often assume all features contribute equally to the
data structure, an assumption that usually fails in high-dimensional or noisy
settings. Feature weighting methods can address this, but most require
additional parameter tuning. We propose SHARK (Shapley Reweighted $k$-means), a
feature-weighted clustering algorithm motivated by the use of Shapley values
from cooperative game theory to quantify feature relevance, which requires no
additional parameters beyond those in $k$-means. We prove that the $k$-means
objective can be decomposed into a sum of per-feature Shapley values, providing
an axiomatic foundation for unsupervised feature relevance and reducing Shapley
computation from exponential to polynomial time. SHARK iteratively re-weights
features by the inverse of their Shapley contribution, emphasising informative
dimensions and down-weighting irrelevant ones. Experiments on synthetic and
real-world data sets show that SHARK consistently matches or outperforms
existing methods, achieving superior robustness and accuracy, particularly in
scenarios where noise may be present. Software:

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a prominent
paradigm for training large language models and multimodal systems. Despite
notable advances enabled by existing RLHF training frameworks, significant
challenges remain in scaling to complex multimodal workflows and adapting to
dynamic workloads. In particular, current systems often encounter limitations
related to controller scalability when managing large models, as well as
inefficiencies in orchestrating intricate RLHF pipelines, especially in
scenarios that require dynamic sampling and resource allocation. In this paper,
we introduce WeChat-YATT (Yet Another Transformer Trainer in WeChat), a simple,
scalable, and balanced RLHF training framework specifically designed to address
these challenges. WeChat-YATT features a parallel controller programming model
that enables flexible and efficient orchestration of complex RLHF workflows,
effectively mitigating the bottlenecks associated with centralized controller
architectures and facilitating scalability in large-scale data scenarios. In
addition, we propose a dynamic placement schema that adaptively partitions
computational resources and schedules workloads, thereby significantly reducing
hardware idle time and improving GPU utilization under variable training
conditions. We evaluate WeChat-YATT across a range of experimental scenarios,
demonstrating that it achieves substantial improvements in throughput compared
to state-of-the-art RLHF training frameworks. Furthermore, WeChat-YATT has been
successfully deployed to train models supporting WeChat product features for a
large-scale user base, underscoring its effectiveness and robustness in
real-world applications.

Abstract: Traffic state estimation (TSE) falls methodologically into three categories:
model-driven, data-driven, and model-data dual-driven. Model-driven TSE relies
on macroscopic traffic flow models originated from hydrodynamics. Data-driven
TSE leverages historical sensing data and employs statistical models or machine
learning methods to infer traffic state. Model-data dual-driven traffic state
estimation attempts to harness the strengths of both aspects to achieve more
accurate TSE. From the perspective of mathematical operator theory, TSE can be
viewed as a type of operator that maps available measurements of inerested
traffic state into unmeasured traffic state variables in real time. For the
first time this paper proposes to study real-time freeway TSE in the idea of
physics-informed deep operator network (PI-DeepONet), which is an
operator-oriented architecture embedding traffic flow models based on deep
neural networks. The paper has developed an extended architecture from the
original PI-DeepONet. The extended architecture is featured with: (1) the
acceptance of 2-D data input so as to support CNN-based computations; (2) the
introduction of a nonlinear expansion layer, an attention mechanism, and a MIMO
mechanism; (3) dedicated neural network design for adaptive identification of
traffic flow model parameters. A traffic state estimator built on the basis of
this extended PI-DeepONet architecture was evaluated with respect to a short
freeway stretch of NGSIM and a large-scale urban expressway in China, along
with other four baseline TSE methods. The evaluation results demonstrated that
this novel TSE method outperformed the baseline methods with high-precision
estimation results of flow and mean speed.

Abstract: Extensive experiments and prior studies show that no single maximum clique
algorithm consistently performs best across all instances, highlighting the
importance of selecting suitable algorithms based on instance features. Through
an extensive analysis of relevant studies, it is found that there is a lack of
research work concerning algorithm selection oriented toward the Maximum Clique
Problem (MCP). In this work, we propose a learning-based framework that
integrates both traditional machine learning and graph neural networks to
address this gap. We construct a labeled dataset by running four exact MCP
algorithms on a diverse collection of graph instances, accompanied by
structural and global statistical features extracted from each graph. We first
evaluate four conventional classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random
Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), across multiple
dataset variants. Experimental results show that RF consistently shows strong
performance across metrics and dataset variants, making it a reliable baseline.
In addition, feature importance analysis indicates that connectivity and
topological structure are strong predictors of algorithm performance. Building
on these findings, we develop a dual-channel model named GAT-MLP, which
combines a Graph Attention Network (GAT) for local structural encoding with a
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for global feature modeling. The GAT-MLP model
shows strong and consistent performance across all metrics. Our results
highlight the effectiveness of dual-channel architectures and the promise of
graph neural networks in combinatorial algorithm selection.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效减少了通信开销，同时利用了信道信息，适用于异步设备环境。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging learning framework that enables edge
devices to collaboratively train ML models without sharing their local data. FL
faces, however, a significant challenge due to the high amount of information
that must be exchanged between the devices and the aggregator in the training
phase, which can exceed the limited capacity of wireless systems. In this
paper, two communication-efficient FL methods are considered where
communication overhead is reduced by communicating scalar values instead of
long vectors and by allowing high number of users to send information
simultaneously. The first approach employs a zero-order optimization technique
with two-point gradient estimator, while the second involves a first-order
gradient computation strategy. The novelty lies in leveraging channel
information in the learning algorithms, eliminating hence the need for
additional resources to acquire channel state information (CSI) and to remove
its impact, as well as in considering asynchronous devices. We provide a
rigorous analytical framework for the two methods, deriving convergence
guarantees and establishing appropriate performance bounds.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖专用仪器或固定物理模型，难以大规模部署，因此需要一种更实用的解决方案。

Method: 使用动力系统动态特征集，结合传统机器学习和深度神经网络（如Transformer和LSTM）进行预测。

Result: 内燃机瞬时误差低至10^-3，累计误差低于3%；电动车和混合动力车的累计误差分别低于4.1%和2.1%。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于多种车型，但电动车和混合动力车因复杂的电源管理需更稳健的模型。

Abstract: Accurate power consumption prediction is crucial for improving efficiency and
reducing environmental impact, yet traditional methods relying on specialized
instruments or rigid physical models are impractical for large-scale,
real-world deployment. This study introduces a scalable data-driven method
using powertrain dynamic feature sets and both traditional machine learning and
deep neural networks to estimate instantaneous and cumulative power consumption
in internal combustion engine (ICE), electric vehicle (EV), and hybrid electric
vehicle (HEV) platforms. ICE models achieved high instantaneous accuracy with
mean absolute error and root mean squared error on the order of $10^{-3}$, and
cumulative errors under 3%. Transformer and long short-term memory models
performed best for EVs and HEVs, with cumulative errors below 4.1% and 2.1%,
respectively. Results confirm the approach's effectiveness across vehicles and
models. Uncertainty analysis revealed greater variability in EV and HEV
datasets than ICE, due to complex power management, emphasizing the need for
robust models for advanced powertrains.

Abstract: Prompt-based tuning has emerged as a lightweight alternative to full
fine-tuning in large vision-language models, enabling efficient adaptation via
learned contextual prompts. This paradigm has recently been extended to
federated learning settings (e.g., PromptFL), where clients collaboratively
train prompts under data privacy constraints. However, the security
implications of prompt-based aggregation in federated multimodal learning
remain largely unexplored, leaving a critical attack surface unaddressed. In
this paper, we introduce \textbf{BadPromptFL}, the first backdoor attack
targeting prompt-based federated learning in multimodal contrastive models. In
BadPromptFL, compromised clients jointly optimize local backdoor triggers and
prompt embeddings, injecting poisoned prompts into the global aggregation
process. These prompts are then propagated to benign clients, enabling
universal backdoor activation at inference without modifying model parameters.
Leveraging the contextual learning behavior of CLIP-style architectures,
BadPromptFL achieves high attack success rates (e.g., \(>90\%\)) with minimal
visibility and limited client participation. Extensive experiments across
multiple datasets and aggregation protocols validate the effectiveness,
stealth, and generalizability of our attack, raising critical concerns about
the robustness of prompt-based federated learning in real-world deployments.

Result: 实验表明，无论网络架构或优化方法如何，当新任务分布与之前不同时，神经网络表示新任务的能力会下降。

Conclusion: CLEMC揭示了持续学习中稳定性与可塑性平衡的非静态本质，为未来研究提供了理论基础。

Abstract: The stability-plasticity dilemma, closely related to a neural network's (NN)
capacity-its ability to represent tasks-is a fundamental challenge in continual
learning (CL). Within this context, we introduce CL's effective model capacity
(CLEMC) that characterizes the dynamic behavior of the stability-plasticity
balance point. We develop a difference equation to model the evolution of the
interplay between the NN, task data, and optimization procedure. We then
leverage CLEMC to demonstrate that the effective capacity-and, by extension,
the stability-plasticity balance point is inherently non-stationary. We show
that regardless of the NN architecture or optimization method, a NN's ability
to represent new tasks diminishes when incoming task distributions differ from
previous ones. We conduct extensive experiments to support our theoretical
findings, spanning a range of architectures-from small feedforward network and
convolutional networks to medium-sized graph neural networks and
transformer-based large language models with millions of parameters.

Conclusion: C-MAG为供应链多模态数据链接预测提供了有效解决方案，并具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Connecting an ever-expanding catalogue of products with suitable
manufacturers and suppliers is critical for resilient, efficient global supply
chains, yet traditional methods struggle to capture complex capabilities,
certifications, geographic constraints, and rich multimodal data of real-world
manufacturer profiles. To address these gaps, we introduce PMGraph, a public
benchmark of bipartite and heterogeneous multimodal supply-chain graphs linking
8,888 manufacturers, over 70k products, more than 110k manufacturer-product
edges, and over 29k product images. Building on this benchmark, we propose the
Cascade Multimodal Attributed Graph C-MAG, a two-stage architecture that first
aligns and aggregates textual and visual attributes into intermediate group
embeddings, then propagates them through a manufacturer-product hetero-graph
via multiscale message passing to enhance link prediction accuracy. C-MAG also
provides practical guidelines for modality-aware fusion, preserving predictive
performance in noisy, real-world settings.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于分类器的预剪枝方法，显著提升逻辑优化效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统逻辑优化算子计算成本高，且成功率低（平均98%失败），需减少无效操作。

Method: 利用分类器预判并剪枝不成功的切割，避免不必要的重合成操作。

Result: 在EPFL基准套件和10个大型工业设计上测试，平均提速3.9倍。

Conclusion: 该方法有效降低计算成本，显著提升逻辑优化效率。

Abstract: In electronic design automation, logic optimization operators play a crucial
role in minimizing the gate count of logic circuits. However, their computation
demands are high. Operators such as refactor conventionally form iterative cuts
for each node, striving for a more compact representation - a task which often
fails 98% on average. Prior research has sought to mitigate computational cost
through parallelization. In contrast, our approach leverages a classifier to
prune unsuccessful cuts preemptively, thus eliminating unnecessary resynthesis
operations. Experiments on the refactor operator using the EPFL benchmark suite
and 10 large industrial designs demonstrate that this technique can speedup
logic optimization by 3.9x on average compared with the state-of-the-art ABC
implementation.

Result: PE-FNO在动态负载下表现优异，误差低于1%，速度比传统求解器快200倍，并在参数估计任务中展现了泛化能力。

Conclusion: PE-FNO为实时电池管理和电化学数字孪生提供了高速度、高保真度的解决方案。

Abstract: Reliable digital twins of lithium-ion batteries must achieve high physical
fidelity with sub-millisecond speed. In this work, we benchmark three
operator-learning surrogates for the Single Particle Model (SPM): Deep Operator
Networks (DeepONets), Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) and a newly proposed
parameter-embedded Fourier Neural Operator (PE-FNO), which conditions each
spectral layer on particle radius and solid-phase diffusivity. Models are
trained on simulated trajectories spanning four current families (constant,
triangular, pulse-train, and Gaussian-random-field) and a full range of
State-of-Charge (SOC) (0 % to 100 %). DeepONet accurately replicates
constant-current behaviour but struggles with more dynamic loads. The basic FNO
maintains mesh invariance and keeps concentration errors below 1 %, with
voltage mean-absolute errors under 1.7 mV across all load types. Introducing
parameter embedding marginally increases error, but enables generalisation to
varying radii and diffusivities. PE-FNO executes approximately 200 times faster
than a 16-thread SPM solver. Consequently, PE-FNO's capabilities in inverse
tasks are explored in a parameter estimation task with Bayesian optimisation,
recovering anode and cathode diffusivities with 1.14 % and 8.4 % mean absolute
percentage error, respectively, and 0.5918 percentage points higher error in
comparison with classical methods. These results pave the way for neural
operators to meet the accuracy, speed and parametric flexibility demands of
real-time battery management, design-of-experiments and large-scale inference.
PE-FNO outperforms conventional neural surrogates, offering a practical path
towards high-speed and high-fidelity electrochemical digital twins.

Conclusion: Grid2Guide是一种轻量级、无需基础设施的实时室内导航解决方案。

Abstract: Reliable indoor navigation remains a significant challenge in complex
environments, particularly where external positioning signals and dedicated

navigation framework that combines the A* search algorithm with a Small

framework first conducts a binary occupancy matrix from a given indoor map.
Using this matrix, the A* algorithm computes the optimal path between origin
and destination, producing concise textual navigation steps. These steps are
then transformed into natural language instructions by the SLM, enhancing
interpretability for end users. Experimental evaluations across various indoor
scenarios demonstrate the method's effectiveness in producing accurate and
timely navigation guidance. The results validate the proposed approach as a

Abstract: Indoor navigation remains a complex challenge due to the absence of reliable
GPS signals and the architectural intricacies of large enclosed environments.
This study presents an indoor localization and navigation approach that
integrates vision-based localization with large language model (LLM)-based
navigation. The localization system utilizes a ResNet-50 convolutional neural
network fine-tuned through a two-stage process to identify the user's position
using smartphone camera input. To complement localization, the navigation
module employs an LLM, guided by a carefully crafted system prompt, to
interpret preprocessed floor plan images and generate step-by-step directions.
Experimental evaluation was conducted in a realistic office corridor with
repetitive features and limited visibility to test localization robustness. The
model achieved high confidence and an accuracy of 96% across all tested
waypoints, even under constrained viewing conditions and short-duration
queries. Navigation tests using ChatGPT on real building floor maps yielded an
average instruction accuracy of 75%, with observed limitations in zero-shot
reasoning and inference time. This research demonstrates the potential for
scalable, infrastructure-free indoor navigation using off-the-shelf cameras and
publicly available floor plans, particularly in resource-constrained settings
like hospitals, airports, and educational institutions.

Conclusion: memoryKT通过完整记忆周期建模，提升了个性化感知能力。

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) is committed to capturing students' knowledge mastery
from their historical interactions. Simulating students' memory states is a
promising approach to enhance both the performance and interpretability of
knowledge tracing models. Memory consists of three fundamental processes:
encoding, storage, and retrieval. Although forgetting primarily manifests
during the storage stage, most existing studies rely on a single,
undifferentiated forgetting mechanism, overlooking other memory processes as
well as personalized forgetting patterns. To address this, this paper proposes
memoryKT, a knowledge tracing model based on a novel temporal variational
autoencoder. The model simulates memory dynamics through a three-stage process:
(i) Learning the distribution of students' knowledge memory features, (ii)
Reconstructing their exercise feedback, while (iii) Embedding a personalized
forgetting module within the temporal workflow to dynamically modulate memory
storage strength. This jointly models the complete encoding-storage-retrieval
cycle, significantly enhancing the model's perception capability for individual
differences. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that our
proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Large-scale models pre-trained on Electroencephalography (EEG) have shown
promise in clinical applications such as neurological disorder detection.
However, the practical deployment of EEG-based large-scale models faces
critical challenges such as limited labeled EEG data and suboptimal performance
in clinical scenarios. To address these issues, we propose NeuroDx-LM, a novel
large-scale model specifically designed for detecting EEG-based neurological
disorders. Our key contributions include (i) a Selective Temporal-Frequency
Embedding mechanism that adaptively captures complex temporal and spectral
patterns in EEG signals; and (ii) a Progressive Feature-Aware Training strategy
that refines feature representation in a two-stage process. In the first stage,
our model learns the fundamental discriminative features of EEG activities; in
the second stage, the model further extracts more specialized fine-grained
features for accurate diagnostic performance. We evaluated NeuroDx-LM on the
CHB-MIT and Schizophrenia datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in
EEG-based seizure and schizophrenia detection, respectively. These results
demonstrate the great potential of EEG-based large-scale models to advance
clinical applicability. Our code is available at

Conclusion: OFAL为无监督主动学习提供了一种高效方法，减少了对人工标注的依赖。

Abstract: In the active learning paradigm, using an oracle to label data has always
been a complex and expensive task, and with the emersion of large unlabeled
data pools, it would be highly beneficial If we could achieve better results
without relying on an oracle. This research introduces OFAL, an oracle-free
active learning scheme that utilizes neural network uncertainty. OFAL uses the
model's own uncertainty to transform highly confident unlabeled samples into
informative uncertain samples. First, we start with separating and quantifying
different parts of uncertainty and introduce Monte Carlo Dropouts as an
approximation of the Bayesian Neural Network model. Secondly, by adding a
variational autoencoder, we go on to generate new uncertain samples by stepping
toward the uncertain part of latent space starting from a confidence seed
sample. By generating these new informative samples, we can perform active
learning and enhance the model's accuracy. Lastly, we try to compare and
integrate our method with other widely used active learning sampling methods.

Abstract: Conducting a comprehensive literature review is crucial for advancing circuit
design methodologies. However, the rapid influx of state-of-the-art research,
inconsistent data representation, and the complexity of optimizing circuit
design objectives make this task significantly challenging. In this paper, we
propose MuaLLM, an open-source multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) agent for
circuit design assistance that integrates a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) framework with an adaptive vector database of circuit design
research papers. Unlike conventional LLMs, the MuaLLM agent employs a Reason +
Act (ReAct) workflow for iterative reasoning, goal-setting, and multi-step
information retrieval. It functions as a question-answering design assistant,
capable of interpreting complex queries and providing reasoned responses
grounded in circuit literature. Its multimodal capabilities enable processing
of both textual and visual data, facilitating more efficient and comprehensive
analysis. The system dynamically adapts using intelligent search tools,
automated document retrieval from the internet, and real-time database updates.
Unlike conventional approaches constrained by model context limits, MuaLLM
decouples retrieval from inference, enabling scalable reasoning over
arbitrarily large corpora. At the maximum context length supported by standard
LLMs, MuaLLM remains up to 10x less costly and 1.6x faster while maintaining
the same accuracy. This allows rapid, no-human-in-the-loop database generation,
overcoming the bottleneck of simulation-based dataset creation for circuits. To
evaluate MuaLLM, we introduce two custom datasets: RAG-250, targeting retrieval
and citation performance, and Reasoning-100 (Reas-100), focused on multistep
reasoning in circuit design. MuaLLM achieves 90.1% recall on RAG-250, and 86.8%
accuracy on Reas-100.

TL;DR: 本文研究了使用联邦学习（FL）在多个临床站点上开发癫痫发作预测模型，提出了一种随机子集聚合策略以解决数据异质性问题，显著提升了模型在代表性不足站点上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于患者隐私法规和数据异质性（非独立同分布特性），开发跨多个临床站点的准确且可泛化的癫痫发作预测模型具有挑战性。联邦学习提供了一种隐私保护的协作训练框架，但标准聚合方法（如FedAvg）在异质环境中可能因主导数据集而产生偏差。

Method: 本文采用单通道EEG数据，基于四个公共数据集（Siena、CHB-MIT、Helsinki、NCH），提出隐私保护的全局归一化和随机子集聚合策略。每个客户端每轮训练固定大小的随机数据子集，确保聚合时的平等贡献。

Result: 本地训练的模型无法跨站点泛化，标准加权FedAvg在代表性不足站点上表现不佳（如Helsinki和NCH准确率仅约50%）。随机子集聚合显著提升了这些站点的性能（Helsinki准确率提升至81.7%，NCH提升至68.7%），整体宏平均准确率达77.1%，池化准确率达80.0%。

Conclusion: 随机子集聚合策略在异质多医院环境中构建了更鲁棒且公平的全局模型，展示了平衡FL方法在保护隐私的同时开发有效且可泛化癫痫预测系统的潜力。

Abstract: Developing accurate and generalizable epileptic seizure prediction models
from electroencephalography (EEG) data across multiple clinical sites is
hindered by patient privacy regulations and significant data heterogeneity
(non-IID characteristics). Federated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving
framework for collaborative training, but standard aggregation methods like
Federated Averaging (FedAvg) can be biased by dominant datasets in
heterogeneous settings. This paper investigates FL for seizure prediction using
a single EEG channel across four diverse public datasets (Siena, CHB-MIT,
Helsinki, NCH), representing distinct patient populations (adult, pediatric,
neonate) and recording conditions. We implement privacy-preserving global
normalization and propose a Random Subset Aggregation strategy, where each
client trains on a fixed-size random subset of its data per round, ensuring
equal contribution during aggregation. Our results show that locally trained
models fail to generalize across sites, and standard weighted FedAvg yields
highly skewed performance (e.g., 89.0% accuracy on CHB-MIT but only 50.8% on
Helsinki and 50.6% on NCH). In contrast, Random Subset Aggregation
significantly improves performance on under-represented clients (accuracy
increases to 81.7% on Helsinki and 68.7% on NCH) and achieves a superior
macro-average accuracy of 77.1% and pooled accuracy of 80.0% across all sites,
demonstrating a more robust and fair global model. This work highlights the
potential of balanced FL approaches for building effective and generalizable
seizure prediction systems in realistic, heterogeneous multi-hospital
environments while respecting data privacy.

Abstract: Traditional neural networks have an impressive classification performance,
but what they learn cannot be inspected, verified or extracted. Neural Logic
Networks on the other hand have an interpretable structure that enables them to
learn a logical mechanism relating the inputs and outputs with AND and OR
operations. We generalize these networks with NOT operations and biases that
take into account unobserved data and develop a rigorous logical and
probabilistic modeling in terms of concept combinations to motivate their use.
We also propose a novel factorized IF-THEN rule structure for the model as well
as a modified learning algorithm. Our method improves the state-of-the-art in
Boolean networks discovery and is able to learn relevant, interpretable rules
in tabular classification, notably on an example from the medical field where

Motivation: 脑机接口在个性化音乐干预中具有潜力，但个体间EEG信号差异和运动伪影限制了其泛化能力，需要长时间校准。

Method: 提出ITSA方法，结合个体特异性重中心化、分布匹配和监督旋转对齐，并融合RCSP与黎曼几何的混合架构。

Result: ITSA在跨个体和条件下表现显著提升，并行融合方法优于顺序融合，且在不同数据条件下保持稳健。

Conclusion: ITSA为脑机接口在个性化音乐干预中的泛化提供了有效解决方案，代码将公开。

Abstract: Personalised music-based interventions offer a powerful means of supporting
motor rehabilitation by dynamically tailoring auditory stimuli to provide
external timekeeping cues, modulate affective states, and stabilise gait
patterns. Generalisable Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) thus hold promise for
adapting these interventions across individuals. However, inter-subject
variability in EEG signals, further compounded by movement-induced artefacts
and motor planning differences, hinders the generalisability of BCIs and
results in lengthy calibration processes. We propose Individual Tangent Space
Alignment (ITSA), a novel pre-alignment strategy incorporating subject-specific
recentering, distribution matching, and supervised rotational alignment to
enhance cross-subject generalisation. Our hybrid architecture fuses Regularised
Common Spatial Patterns (RCSP) with Riemannian geometry in parallel and
sequential configurations, improving class separability while maintaining the
geometric structure of covariance matrices for robust statistical computation.
Using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, `ITSA' demonstrates significant
performance improvements across subjects and conditions. The parallel fusion
approach shows the greatest enhancement over its sequential counterpart, with
robust performance maintained across varying data conditions and electrode
configurations. The code will be made publicly available at the time of
publication.

TL;DR: 论文研究了Transformer如何通过训练学习解决符号多步推理任务，特别是树中的路径查找问题，揭示了其机制和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解Transformer如何通过训练获得多步推理能力，尤其是从理论角度分析其学习机制。

Method: 分析两个任务：反向推理（从目标节点到根节点的路径）和更复杂的前向推理（两阶段推理）。通过梯度下降动态的理论分析，研究单层Transformer如何解决这些任务。

Result: 研究表明，训练后的单层Transformer可以解决任务并泛化到未见过的树结构。前向推理的多阶段训练动态揭示了注意力头的专业化和协作机制。

Conclusion: 论文提供了Transformer实现顺序算法程序的机制解释，并表明结构化任务和中间思维链步骤可以使浅层Transformer有效解决问题。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in multi-step
reasoning tasks. However, understandings of the underlying mechanisms by which
they acquire these abilities through training remain limited, particularly from
a theoretical standpoint. This work investigates how transformers learn to
solve symbolic multi-step reasoning problems through chain-of-thought
processes, focusing on path-finding in trees. We analyze two intertwined tasks:
a backward reasoning task, where the model outputs a path from a goal node to
the root, and a more complex forward reasoning task, where the model implements
two-stage reasoning by first identifying the goal-to-root path and then
reversing it to produce the root-to-goal path. Our theoretical analysis,
grounded in the dynamics of gradient descent, shows that trained one-layer
transformers can provably solve both tasks with generalization guarantees to
unseen trees. In particular, our multi-phase training dynamics for forward
reasoning elucidate how different attention heads learn to specialize and
coordinate autonomously to solve the two subtasks in a single autoregressive
path. These results provide a mechanistic explanation of how trained
transformers can implement sequential algorithmic procedures. Moreover, they
offer insights into the emergence of reasoning abilities, suggesting that when
tasks are structured to take intermediate chain-of-thought steps, even shallow
multi-head transformers can effectively solve problems that would otherwise
require deeper architectures.

Conclusion: 该方法为自动化冠状动脉标注提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the leading cause of death globally,
with computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) serving as a key
diagnostic tool. However, coronary arterial analysis using CTCA, such as
identifying artery-specific features from computational modelling, is
labour-intensive and time-consuming. Automated anatomical labelling of coronary
arteries offers a potential solution, yet the inherent anatomical variability
of coronary trees presents a significant challenge. Traditional knowledge-based
labelling methods fall short in leveraging data-driven insights, while recent
deep-learning approaches often demand substantial computational resources and
overlook critical clinical knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose
a lightweight method that integrates anatomical knowledge with rule-based
topology constraints for effective coronary artery labelling. Our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, providing a
promising alternative for automated coronary artery labelling.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable classification of brain tumors from magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) is critical for effective diagnosis and treatment
planning. This study presents an ensemble-based deep learning framework that
combines MobileNetV2 and DenseNet121 convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using
a soft voting strategy to classify three common brain tumor types: glioma,
meningioma, and pituitary adenoma. The models were trained and evaluated on the
Figshare dataset using a stratified 5-fold cross-validation protocol. To
enhance transparency and clinical trust, the framework integrates an
Explainable AI (XAI) module employing Grad-CAM++ for class-specific saliency
visualization, alongside a symbolic Clinical Decision Rule Overlay (CDRO) that
maps predictions to established radiological heuristics. The ensemble
classifier achieved superior performance compared to individual CNNs, with an
accuracy of 91.7%, precision of 91.9%, recall of 91.7%, and F1-score of 91.6%.
Grad-CAM++ visualizations revealed strong spatial alignment between model
attention and expert-annotated tumor regions, supported by Dice coefficients up
to 0.88 and IoU scores up to 0.78. Clinical rule activation further validated
model predictions in cases with distinct morphological features. A
human-centered interpretability assessment involving five board-certified
radiologists yielded high Likert-scale scores for both explanation usefulness
(mean = 4.4) and heatmap-region correspondence (mean = 4.0), reinforcing the
framework's clinical relevance. Overall, the proposed approach offers a robust,
interpretable, and generalizable solution for automated brain tumor
classification, advancing the integration of deep learning into clinical
neurodiagnostics.

Abstract: Image-based personalized medicine has the potential to transform healthcare,

Multiple Sclerosis (MS). In this work, we introduce the first treatment-aware
spatio-temporal diffusion model that is able to generate future masks
demonstrating lesion evolution in MS. Our voxel-space approach incorporates
multi-modal patient data, including MRI and treatment information, to forecast
new and enlarging T2 (NET2) lesion masks at a future time point. Extensive
experiments on a multi-centre dataset of 2131 patient 3D MRIs from randomized
clinical trials for relapsing-remitting MS demonstrate that our generative
model is able to accurately predict NET2 lesion masks for patients across six
different treatments. Moreover, we demonstrate our model has the potential for
real-world clinical applications through downstream tasks such as future lesion
count and location estimation, binary lesion activity classification, and
generating counterfactual future NET2 masks for several treatments with
different efficacies. This work highlights the potential of causal, image-based
generative models as powerful tools for advancing data-driven prognostics in
MS.

Motivation: LLMs在医学影像任务中的应用日益增多，但其产生的幻觉（自信但错误的输出）可能误导临床决策，因此需要系统性研究。

Method: 研究分析了LLMs在图像到文本（生成报告）和文本到图像（生成影像）任务中的幻觉，使用专家标准评估错误类型。

Result: 研究发现两种任务中均存在常见的幻觉模式，并揭示了模型架构和训练数据等因素的影响。

Conclusion: 通过系统性研究，本文为提升LLM驱动的医学影像系统的安全性和可信度提供了见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to medical imaging
tasks, including image interpretation and synthetic image generation. However,
these models often produce hallucinations, which are confident but incorrect
outputs that can mislead clinical decisions. This study examines hallucinations
in two directions: image to text, where LLMs generate reports from X-ray, CT,
or MRI scans, and text to image, where models create medical images from
clinical prompts. We analyze errors such as factual inconsistencies and
anatomical inaccuracies, evaluating outputs using expert informed criteria
across imaging modalities. Our findings reveal common patterns of hallucination
in both interpretive and generative tasks, with implications for clinical
reliability. We also discuss factors contributing to these failures, including
model architecture and training data. By systematically studying both image
understanding and generation, this work provides insights into improving the
safety and trustworthiness of LLM driven medical imaging systems.

Result: 在心脏MRI数据集上，SAGCNet在定量和定性上均优于现有方法，且在数据有限时仍表现优异。

Conclusion: SAGCNet通过结合切片间关系和3D空间信息，有效解决了MRI缺失切片合成问题。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides detailed soft-tissue
characteristics that assist in disease diagnosis and screening. However, the
accuracy of clinical practice is often hindered by missing or unusable slices
due to various factors. Volumetric MRI synthesis methods have been developed to
address this issue by imputing missing slices from available ones. The inherent
3D nature of volumetric MRI data, such as cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR),
poses significant challenges for missing slice imputation approaches, including
(1) the difficulty of modeling local inter-slice correlations and dependencies
of volumetric slices, and (2) the limited exploration of crucial 3D spatial
information and global context. In this study, to mitigate these issues, we
present Spatial-Aware Graph Completion Network (SAGCNet) to overcome the
dependency on complete volumetric data, featuring two main innovations: (1) a
volumetric slice graph completion module that incorporates the inter-slice
relationships into a graph structure, and (2) a volumetric spatial adapter
component that enables our model to effectively capture and utilize various
forms of 3D spatial context. Extensive experiments on cardiac MRI datasets
demonstrate that SAGCNet is capable of synthesizing absent CMR slices,
outperforming competitive state-of-the-art MRI synthesis methods both
quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, our model maintains superior
performance even with limited slice data.

Abstract: Multi-sequence Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers remarkable
versatility, enabling the distinct visualization of different tissue types.
Nevertheless, the inherent heterogeneity among MRI sequences poses significant
challenges to the generalization capability of deep learning models. These
challenges undermine model performance when faced with varying acquisition
parameters, thereby severely restricting their clinical utility. In this study,
we present PRISM, a foundation model PRe-trained with large-scale
multI-Sequence MRI. We collected a total of 64 datasets from both public and
private sources, encompassing a wide range of whole-body anatomical structures,
with scans spanning diverse MRI sequences. Among them, 336,476 volumetric MRI
scans from 34 datasets (8 public and 26 private) were curated to construct the
largest multi-organ multi-sequence MRI pretraining corpus to date. We propose a
novel pretraining paradigm that disentangles anatomically invariant features
from sequence-specific variations in MRI, while preserving high-level semantic
representations. We established a benchmark comprising 44 downstream tasks,
including disease diagnosis, image segmentation, registration, progression
prediction, and report generation. These tasks were evaluated on 32 public
datasets and 5 private cohorts. PRISM consistently outperformed both
non-pretrained models and existing foundation models, achieving first-rank
results in 39 out of 44 downstream benchmarks with statistical significance
improvements. These results underscore its ability to learn robust and
generalizable representations across unseen data acquired under diverse MRI
protocols. PRISM provides a scalable framework for multi-sequence MRI analysis,
thereby enhancing the translational potential of AI in radiology. It delivers
consistent performance across diverse imaging protocols, reinforcing its
clinical applicability.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) reveals spatial heterogeneity of gene
expression, yet its resolution is limited by current platforms. Recent methods
enhance resolution via H&E-stained histology, but three major challenges
persist: (1) isolating expression-relevant features from visually complex H&E
images; (2) achieving spatially precise multimodal alignment in diffusion-based
frameworks; and (3) modeling gene-specific variation across expression
channels. We propose HaDM-ST (Histology-assisted Differential Modeling for ST
Generation), a high-resolution ST generation framework conditioned on H&E
images and low-resolution ST. HaDM-ST includes: (i) a semantic distillation
network to extract predictive cues from H&E; (ii) a spatial alignment module
enforcing pixel-wise correspondence with low-resolution ST; and (iii) a
channel-aware adversarial learner for fine-grained gene-level modeling.
Experiments on 200 genes across diverse tissues and species show HaDM-ST
consistently outperforms prior methods, enhancing spatial fidelity and

Motivation: 传统多步扩散方法效率低，DiffVC-OSD旨在通过一步扩散提升压缩效率和感知质量。

Result: 实验显示DiffVC-OSD在感知压缩性能上达到最优，解码速度快20倍，比特率降低86.92%。

Conclusion: DiffVC-OSD在视频压缩中实现了高效与高质量的平衡。

Abstract: In this work, we first propose DiffVC-OSD, a One-Step Diffusion-based
Perceptual Neural Video Compression framework. Unlike conventional multi-step
diffusion-based methods, DiffVC-OSD feeds the reconstructed latent
representation directly into a One-Step Diffusion Model, enhancing perceptual
quality through a single diffusion step guided by both temporal context and the
latent itself. To better leverage temporal dependencies, we design a Temporal
Context Adapter that encodes conditional inputs into multi-level features,
offering more fine-grained guidance for the Denoising Unet. Additionally, we
employ an End-to-End Finetuning strategy to improve overall compression
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffVC-OSD achieves
state-of-the-art perceptual compression performance, offers about 20$\times$
faster decoding and a 86.92\% bitrate reduction compared to the corresponding
multi-step diffusion-based variant.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在低剂量CT去噪中常忽略解剖语义，导致去噪效果不佳。

Method: ALDEN通过解剖感知判别器和语义引导对比学习模块，动态融合参考CT的层次语义特征并强制解剖一致性。

Conclusion: ALDEN通过结合解剖语义特征，显著提升了低剂量CT去噪的准确性和解剖结构保留能力。

Abstract: To reduce radiation exposure and improve the diagnostic efficacy of low-dose
computed tomography (LDCT), numerous deep learning-based denoising methods have
been developed to mitigate noise and artifacts. However, most of these
approaches ignore the anatomical semantics of human tissues, which may
potentially result in suboptimal denoising outcomes. To address this problem,
we propose ALDEN, an anatomy-aware LDCT denoising method that integrates
semantic features of pretrained vision models (PVMs) with adversarial and
contrastive learning. Specifically, we introduce an anatomy-aware discriminator
that dynamically fuses hierarchical semantic features from reference
normal-dose CT (NDCT) via cross-attention mechanisms, enabling tissue-specific
realism evaluation in the discriminator. In addition, we propose a
semantic-guided contrastive learning module that enforces anatomical
consistency by contrasting PVM-derived features from LDCT, denoised CT and
NDCT, preserving tissue-specific patterns through positive pairs and
suppressing artifacts via dual negative pairs. Extensive experiments conducted
on two LDCT denoising datasets reveal that ALDEN achieves the state-of-the-art
performance, offering superior anatomy preservation and substantially reducing
over-smoothing issue of previous work. Further validation on a downstream
multi-organ segmentation task (encompassing 117 anatomical structures) affirms
the model's ability to maintain anatomical awareness.

Abstract: Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most prevalent form of breast cancer,
and early, accurate diagnosis is critical to improving patient survival rates
by guiding treatment decisions. Combining medical expertise with artificial
intelligence (AI) holds significant promise for enhancing the precision and
efficiency of IDC detection. In this work, we propose a human-in-the-loop
(HITL) deep learning system designed to detect IDC in histopathology images.
The system begins with an initial diagnosis provided by a high-performance
EfficientNetV2S model, offering feedback from AI to the human expert. Medical
professionals then review the AI-generated results, correct any misclassified
images, and integrate the revised labels into the training dataset, forming a
feedback loop from the human back to the AI. This iterative process refines the
model's performance over time. The EfficientNetV2S model itself achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods in the literature,
with an overall accuracy of 93.65\%. Incorporating the human-in-the-loop system
further improves the model's accuracy using four experimental groups with
misclassified images. These results demonstrate the potential of this
collaborative approach to enhance AI performance in diagnostic systems. This
work contributes to advancing automated, efficient, and highly accurate methods
for IDC detection through human-AI collaboration, offering a promising
direction for future AI-assisted medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in generative modelling, existing diffusion
models often struggle to produce anatomically precise female pelvic images,
limiting their application in gynaecological imaging, where data scarcity and
patient privacy concerns are critical. To overcome these barriers, we introduce
a novel diffusion-based framework for uterine MRI synthesis, integrating both
unconditional and conditioned Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs)
and Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) in 2D and 3D. Our approach generates
anatomically coherent, high fidelity synthetic images that closely mimic real
scans and provide valuable resources for training robust diagnostic models. We
evaluate generative quality using advanced perceptual and distributional
metrics, benchmarking against standard reconstruction methods, and demonstrate
substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy on a key classification task. A
blinded expert evaluation further validates the clinical realism of our
synthetic images. We release our models with privacy safeguards and a
comprehensive synthetic uterine MRI dataset to support reproducible research
and advance equitable AI in gynaecology.

Result: 在内部和外部测试数据上表现优异，PSNR超过34 dB，SSIM高于0.92，泛化能力强，适用于未见过的病理区域。

Conclusion: 该方法通过参数嵌入显著提升性能，有望加速qMRI并提高临床实用性。

Abstract: We propose a deep learning-based approach that integrates MRI sequence
parameters to improve the accuracy and generalizability of quantitative image
synthesis from clinical weighted MRI. Our physics-driven neural network embeds
MRI sequence parameters -- repetition time (TR), echo time (TE), and inversion
time (TI) -- directly into the model via parameter embedding, enabling the
network to learn the underlying physical principles of MRI signal formation.
The model takes conventional T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and T2-FLAIR images as
input and synthesizes T1, T2, and proton density (PD) quantitative maps.
Trained on healthy brain MR images, it was evaluated on both internal and
external test datasets. The proposed method achieved high performance with PSNR
values exceeding 34 dB and SSIM values above 0.92 for all synthesized parameter
maps. It outperformed conventional deep learning models in accuracy and
robustness, including data with previously unseen brain structures and lesions.
Notably, our model accurately synthesized quantitative maps for these unseen
pathological regions, highlighting its superior generalization capability.
Incorporating MRI sequence parameters via parameter embedding allows the neural
network to better learn the physical characteristics of MR signals,
significantly enhancing the performance and reliability of quantitative MRI
synthesis. This method shows great potential for accelerating qMRI and
improving its clinical utility.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: RedDino是一种自监督基础模型，专为红细胞图像分析设计，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红细胞形态分析对血液病诊断至关重要，但目前缺乏全面的AI解决方案。

Method: 采用DINOv2自监督学习框架的RBC专用版本，训练于125万张RBC图像数据集。

Result: 在红细胞形状分类上表现优异，特征表示和泛化能力强大。

Conclusion: RedDino解决了计算血液学中的关键挑战，推动了可靠诊断工具的发展。

Abstract: Red blood cells (RBCs) are essential to human health, and their precise
morphological analysis is important for diagnosing hematological disorders.
Despite the promise of foundation models in medical diagnostics, comprehensive
AI solutions for RBC analysis remain scarce. We present RedDino, a
self-supervised foundation model designed for RBC image analysis. RedDino uses
an RBC-specific adaptation of the DINOv2 self-supervised learning framework and
is trained on a curated dataset of 1.25 million RBC images from diverse
acquisition modalities and sources. Extensive evaluations show that RedDino
outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on RBC shape classification.
Through assessments including linear probing and nearest neighbor
classification, we confirm its strong feature representations and
generalization ability. Our main contributions are: (1) a foundation model
tailored for RBC analysis, (2) ablation studies exploring DINOv2 configurations
for RBC modeling, and (3) a detailed evaluation of generalization performance.
RedDino addresses key challenges in computational hematology by capturing
nuanced morphological features, advancing the development of reliable
diagnostic tools. The source code and pretrained models for RedDino are
available at https://github.com/Snarci/RedDino, and the pretrained models can
be downloaded from our Hugging Face collection at
