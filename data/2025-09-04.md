Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has drawn tremendous attention recently. Many
works focus on using modular deep neural networks to construct the end-to-end
archi-tecture. However, whether using powerful large language models (LLM),
especially multi-modality Vision Language Models (VLM) could benefit the
end-to-end driving tasks remain a question. In our work, we demonstrate that
combining end-to-end architectural design and knowledgeable VLMs yield
impressive performance on the driving tasks. It is worth noting that our method
only uses a single camera and is the best camera-only solution across the
leaderboard, demonstrating the effectiveness of vision-based driving approach
and the potential for end-to-end driving tasks.

### [2] [PixFoundation 2.0: Do Video Multi-Modal LLMs Use Motion in Visual Grounding?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02807)
*Mennatullah Siam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了MoCentric-Bench基准测试，用于评估视频多模态大语言模型在像素级视觉定位中对运动信息的理解能力，发现现有模型过度依赖静态外观线索而非真正的时序推理。


<details>

Method: 提出了四种运动中心探测技术，构建了MoCentric-Bench基准测试，确保评估视频MLLMs利用运动与语言交互的能力，而非被静态外观线索主导。

Result: 建立了强大的单图像基线方法，性能与现有方法相当或更好；探索了简单的运动中心适应技术，在MoCentric-Bench上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究挑战未来模型改进密集时空定位和视频内像素级理解能力，提出的基准测试和评估方法为视频MLLMs的运动理解能力提供了新的评估标准。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive
generalization across tasks using images and text modalities. While their
extension to video has enabled tasks such as video question answering and video
captioning, their pixel-level visual grounding abilities are less studied. In
this work, we raise the pertinent question of whether motion is used in
pixel-level visual grounding and whether video MLLMs can segment objects based
on natural language expressions describing their motion patterns. We identify
the shortcomings in the current benchmarks, where we show that a single frame
can often suffice for capturing the motion referring expression without any
temporal reasoning. To address this, we introduce four motion-centric probing
techniques, particularly designed for the visual grounding task, to study video
MLLMs' ability to identify true motion from a fake one and their ability to
grasp the motion order. Consequently, we provide a motion-centric benchmark,
MoCentric-Bench. It ensures that video MLLMs are evaluated towards leveraging
the interaction between motion and language rather than being dominated by
static appearance cues emphasized in existing visual grounding datasets. We
further establish strong single-image baselines that are on par with or
outperform prior methods. Finally, we explore simple motion-centric adaptation
techniques that provide state-of-the-art performance on our MoCentric-Bench.
Our motion-centric benchmark, evaluation and findings challenge future models
to improve dense spatiotemporal grounding and pixel-level understanding within
videos. Code and datasets will be made publicly available at

Abstract: Colon cancer also known as Colorectal cancer, is one of the most malignant
types of cancer worldwide. Early-stage detection of colon cancer is highly
crucial to prevent its deterioration. This research presents a hybrid
multi-scale deep learning architecture that synergizes capsule networks, graph
attention mechanisms, transformer modules, and residual learning to advance
colon cancer classification on the Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological
Image Dataset (LC25000) dataset. The proposed model in this paper utilizes the
HG-TNet model that introduces a hybrid architecture that joins strength points
in transformers and convolutional neural networks to capture multi-scale
features in histopathological images. Mainly, a transformer branch extracts
global contextual bonds by partitioning the image into patches by
convolution-based patch embedding and then processing these patches through a
transformer encoder. Analogously, a dedicated CNN branch captures fine-grained,
local details through successive Incorporation these diverse features, combined
with a self-supervised rotation prediction objective, produce a robust
diagnostic representation that surpasses standard architectures in performance.
Results show better performance not only in accuracy or loss function but also
in these algorithms by utilizing capsule networks to preserve spatial orders
and realize how each element individually combines and forms whole structures.

TL;DR: 一种基于强化学习的主动超声视频采集框架，通过动态选择最信息量丰富的心超视频，在使用只有47%视频的情况下达到80.6%的主动脏苯穿分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主动脏苯穿(AS)是一种威胎生命的心脏病，虽然心超是金标准诊断方法，但在资源有限的农村和边远地区普及性不高。床边超声(POCUS)更易获得，但受限于操作者经验和选择最优成像视图的挑战。

Method: 提出一种基于强化学习(RL)的主动视频采集框架，动态选择每个患者最信息量丰富的心超视频。与依赖固定视频集的传统方法不同，该方法持续评估是否需要额外成像，以优化准确性和效率。

Result: 在2,572名患者的数据上进行测试，该方法在仅使用47%心超视频的情况下，达到了80.6%的主动脏苯穿分类准确率，相比完整采集减少了超过一半的视频需求。

Conclusion: 这一研究证明了主动特征采集在改善主动脏苯穿诊断中的潜力，能够使心超评估更加高效、可扩展性咏个性化，为资源有限地区提供更可持续的诊断方案。

Abstract: Aortic stenosis (AS) is a life-threatening condition caused by a narrowing of
the aortic valve, leading to impaired blood flow. Despite its high prevalence,
access to echocardiography (echo), the gold-standard diagnostic tool, is often
limited due to resource constraints, particularly in rural and underserved
areas. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) offers a more accessible alternative
but is restricted by operator expertise and the challenge of selecting the most
relevant imaging views. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning
(RL)-driven active video acquisition framework that dynamically selects each
patient's most informative echo videos. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
a fixed set of videos, our approach continuously evaluates whether additional
imaging is needed, optimizing both accuracy and efficiency. Tested on data from
2,572 patients, our method achieves 80.6% classification accuracy while using
only 47% of the echo videos compared to a full acquisition. These results
demonstrate the potential of active feature acquisition to enhance AS
diagnosis, making echocardiographic assessments more efficient, scalable, and
personalized. Our source code is available at:

Abstract: There is a growing interest in the development of lidar-based autonomous
mobility and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). To operate and research
on lidar data, researchers often develop code specific to application niche.
This approach leads to duplication of efforts across studies that, in many
cases, share multiple methodological steps such as data input/output (I/O),
pre/post processing, and common algorithms in multi-stage solutions. Moreover,
slight changes in data, algorithms, and/or research focus may force major
revisions in the code. To address these challenges, we present LiGuard, an
open-source software framework that allows researchers to: 1) rapidly develop
code for their lidar-based projects by providing built-in support for data I/O,
pre/post processing, and commonly used algorithms, 2) interactively
add/remove/reorder custom algorithms and adjust their parameters, and 3)
visualize results for classification, detection, segmentation, and tracking
tasks. Moreover, because it creates all the code files in structured
directories, it allows easy sharing of entire projects or even the individual
components to be reused by other researchers. The effectiveness of LiGuard is
demonstrated via case studies.

Abstract: LiDAR-based perception in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), for tasks
such as object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance segmentation, is
predominantly solved by deep neural network models which often require
large-scale labeled datasets during training to achieve generalization.
However, creating these datasets is costly. time consuming and require human
labor before the datasets are ready for training models. This hinders
scalability of the LiDAR-based perception systems in ITS. Sim2Real learning
offers scalable alternative, however, its effectiveness is dependent on the
fidelity of the source simulation(s) to real-world, in terms of environment
structure, actor dynamics, and sensor emulations. In response, this paper
introduces a rigorous and reproducible methodology for creating large-scale,
high-quality synthetic datasets using High-Fidelity Digital Twins (HiFi DTs).
The proposed workflow outlines the steps, tools, and best practices for
digitally replicating real-world environments, encompassing static geometry
modeling, road infrastructure replication, and dynamic traffic scenario
generation. Leveraging open-source and readily available resources such as
satellite imagery and OpenStreetMap data, alongside specific sensor
configurations, this paper provides practical, detailed guidance for
constructing robust synthetic environments. These environments subsequently
facilitate scalable, cost-effective, and diverse dataset generation, forming a
reliable foundation for robust Sim2Real learning.

Abstract: Sim2Real domain transfer offers a cost-effective and scalable approach for
developing LiDAR-based perception (e.g., object detection, tracking,
segmentation) in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, perception
models trained in simulation often under perform on real-world data due to
distributional shifts. To address this Sim2Real gap, this paper proposes a
high-fidelity digital twin (HiFi DT) framework that incorporates real-world
background geometry, lane-level road topology, and sensor-specific
specifications and placement. We formalize the domain adaptation challenge
underlying Sim2Real learning and present a systematic method for constructing
simulation environments that yield in-domain synthetic data. An off-the-shelf
3D object detector is trained on HiFi DT-generated synthetic data and evaluated
on real data. Our experiments show that the DT-trained model outperforms the
equivalent model trained on real data by 4.8%. To understand this gain, we
quantify distributional alignment between synthetic and real data using
multiple metrics, including Chamfer Distance (CD), Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(MMD), Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), and Fr'echet Distance (FD), at both
raw-input and latent-feature levels. Results demonstrate that HiFi DTs
substantially reduce domain shift and improve generalization across diverse
evaluation scenarios. These findings underscore the significant role of digital
twins in enabling reliable, simulation-based LiDAR perception for real-world
ITS applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学影像中领域泛化的关键挑战，传统单源训练模型在真实世界分布偏移下表现不佳。

Abstract: Domain generalization remains a critical challenge in medical imaging, where
models trained on single sources often fail under real-world distribution
shifts. We propose KG-DG, a neuro-symbolic framework for diabetic retinopathy
(DR) classification that integrates vision transformers with expert-guided
symbolic reasoning to enable robust generalization across unseen domains. Our
approach leverages clinical lesion ontologies through structured, rule-based
features and retinal vessel segmentation, fusing them with deep visual
representations via a confidence-weighted integration strategy. The framework
addresses both single-domain generalization (SDG) and multi-domain
generalization (MDG) by minimizing the KL divergence between domain embeddings,
thereby enforcing alignment of high-level clinical semantics. Extensive
experiments across four public datasets (APTOS, EyePACS, Messidor-1,
Messidor-2) demonstrate significant improvements: up to a 5.2% accuracy gain in
cross-domain settings and a 6% improvement over baseline ViT models. Notably,
our symbolic-only model achieves a 63.67% average accuracy in MDG, while the
complete neuro-symbolic integration achieves the highest accuracy compared to
existing published baselines and benchmarks in challenging SDG scenarios.
Ablation studies reveal that lesion-based features (84.65% accuracy)
substantially outperform purely neural approaches, confirming that symbolic
components act as effective regularizers beyond merely enhancing
interpretability. Our findings establish neuro-symbolic integration as a
promising paradigm for building clinically robust, and domain-invariant medical
AI systems.

Abstract: Registration of serial whole-slide histopathological images (WSIs) is
critical for enabling direct comparison across diverse stains and for preparing
paired datasets in artificial intelligence (AI) workflows such as virtual
staining and biomarker prediction. While existing methods often rely on complex
deformable or deep learning approaches that are computationally intensive and
difficult to reproduce, lightweight rigid frameworks-sufficient for many
consecutive-section scenarios-remain underdeveloped. We introduce STAR (Serial
Tissue Alignment for Rigid registration), a fast and robust open-source
framework for multi-WSI alignment. STAR integrates stain-conditioned
preprocessing with a hierarchical coarse-to-fine correlation strategy, adaptive
kernel scaling, and built-in quality control, achieving reliable rigid
registration across heterogeneous tissue types and staining protocols,
including hematoxylin-eosin (H&E), special histochemical stains (e.g., PAS,
PASM, Masson's), and immunohistochemical (IHC) markers (e.g., CD31, KI67).
Evaluated on the ANHIR 2019 and ACROBAT 2022 datasets spanning multiple organs
and scanning conditions, STAR consistently produced stable alignments within
minutes per slide, demonstrating robustness to cross-stain variability and
partial tissue overlap. Beyond benchmarks, we present case studies on H&E-IHC
alignment, construction of multi-IHC panels, and typical failure modes,
underscoring both utility and limitations. Released as an open and lightweight
tool, STAR provides a reproducible baseline that lowers the barrier for
clinical adoption and enables large-scale paired data preparation for
next-generation computational pathology.

Abstract: Multimodal industrial surface defect detection (MISDD) aims to identify and
locate defect in industrial products by fusing RGB and 3D modalities. This
article focuses on modality-missing problems caused by uncertain sensors
availability in MISDD. In this context, the fusion of multiple modalities
encounters several troubles, including learning mode transformation and
information vacancy. To this end, we first propose cross-modal prompt learning,
which includes: i) the cross-modal consistency prompt serves the establishment
of information consistency of dual visual modalities; ii) the modality-specific
prompt is inserted to adapt different input patterns; iii) the missing-aware
prompt is attached to compensate for the information vacancy caused by dynamic
modalities-missing. In addition, we propose symmetric contrastive learning,
which utilizes text modality as a bridge for fusion of dual vision modalities.
Specifically, a paired antithetical text prompt is designed to generate binary
text semantics, and triple-modal contrastive pre-training is offered to
accomplish multimodal learning. Experiment results show that our proposed
method achieves 73.83% I-AUROC and 93.05% P-AUROC with a total missing rate 0.7
for RGB and 3D modalities (exceeding state-of-the-art methods 3.84% and 5.58%
respectively), and outperforms existing approaches to varying degrees under
different missing types and rates. The source code will be available at

Mass Ejections (CMEs). However, existing methods often fail to capture
fine-scale filament structures, particularly barbs, due to a limited ability to
model long-range dependencies and spatial detail.
  We propose EdgeAttNet, a segmentation architecture built on a U-Net backbone
by introducing a novel, learnable edge map derived directly from the input
image. This edge map is incorporated into the model by linearly transforming
the attention Key and Query matrices with the edge information, thereby guiding
the self-attention mechanism at the network's bottleneck to more effectively
capture filament boundaries and barbs. By explicitly integrating this
structural prior into the attention computations, EdgeAttNet enhances spatial
sensitivity and segmentation accuracy while reducing the number of trainable
parameters.
  Trained end-to-end, EdgeAttNet outperforms U-Net and other U-Net-based
transformer baselines on the MAGFILO dataset. It achieves higher segmentation
accuracy and significantly better recognition of filament barbs, with faster
inference performance suitable for practical deployment.

TL;DR: KEPT是一个知识增强的视觉语言模型框架，通过检索场景对齐的示例和链式思维提示来提升自动驾驶的短时轨迹预测性能，在nuScenes数据集上达到了最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在自动驾驶轨迹预测中往往无法有效基于场景动态和领域知识进行推理，需要提升短时轨迹预测的准确性和安全性。

Method: 结合时间频率-空间融合视频编码器、k-means+HNSW检索栈提供场景对齐示例，将检索到的先验知识嵌入到带有明确规划约束的链式思维提示中，采用三阶段微调策略。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，NoAvg协议下达到0.70m平均L2误差和0.21%碰撞率；TemAvg协议下达到0.31m平均L2误差和0.07%碰撞率，检索延迟亚毫秒级。

Conclusion: 检索增强、链式思维引导的视觉语言模型为可解释和可信的自动驾驶提供了一条有前景的数据高效路径。

Abstract: Accurate short-horizon trajectory prediction is pivotal for safe and reliable
autonomous driving, yet existing vision-language models (VLMs) often fail to
effectively ground their reasoning in scene dynamics and domain knowledge. To
address this challenge, this paper introduces KEPT, a knowledge-enhanced VLM
framework that predicts ego trajectories directly from consecutive front-view
driving frames. KEPT couples a temporal frequency-spatial fusion (TFSF) video
encoder, trained via self-supervised learning with hard-negative mining, with a
scalable k-means + HNSW retrieval stack that supplies scene-aligned exemplars.
Retrieved priors are embedded into chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts with explicit
planning constraints, while a triple-stage fine-tuning schedule incrementally
aligns the language head to metric spatial cues, physically feasible motion,
and temporally conditioned front-view planning. Evaluated on nuScenes dataset,
KEPT achieves state-of-the-art performance across open-loop protocols: under
NoAvg, it achieves 0.70m average L2 with a 0.21\% collision rate; under TemAvg
with lightweight ego status, it attains 0.31m average L2 and a 0.07\% collision
rate. Ablation studies show that all three fine-tuning stages contribute
complementary benefits, and that using Top-2 retrieved exemplars yields the
best accuracy-safety trade-off. The k-means-clustered HNSW index delivers
sub-millisecond retrieval latency, supporting practical deployment. These
results indicate that retrieval-augmented, CoT-guided VLMs offer a promising,
data-efficient pathway toward interpretable and trustworthy autonomous driving.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstaDA是一个无需训练的双代理系统，通过LLM和扩散模型的深度协作来增强实例分割数据集，在LVIS 1.0验证集上取得了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实例分割数据标注成本高、类别不平衡的问题，现有方法缺乏LLM与扩散模型的深度协作，未能充分利用训练数据中的丰富信息。

Method: 提出双代理系统：1) Text-Agent通过Prompt Rethink机制迭代优化提示词，促进LLM与扩散模型协作；2) Image-Agent基于训练图像生成新实例来丰富数据分布。两个代理都是独立自动化的流程。

Result: 在LVIS 1.0验证集上，相比基线提升box AP +4.0和mask AP +3.3；相比领先模型DiverGen，提升box AP +0.3和mask AP +0.1，在常见类别上box AP提升+0.7，mask AP在常见和频繁类别上分别提升+0.2和+0.5。

Conclusion: InstaDA通过深度协作的LLM-扩散模型框架有效提升了实例分割数据增强的效果，证明了训练数据信息充分利用的重要性。

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality instance segmentation data is challenging due to the
labor-intensive nature of the annotation process and significant class
imbalances within datasets. Recent studies have utilized the integration of
Copy-Paste and diffusion models to create more diverse datasets. However, these
studies often lack deep collaboration between large language models (LLMs) and
diffusion models, and underutilize the rich information within the existing
training data. To address these limitations, we propose InstaDA, a novel,
training-free Dual-Agent system designed to augment instance segmentation
datasets. First, we introduce a Text-Agent (T-Agent) that enhances data
diversity through collaboration between LLMs and diffusion models. This agent
features a novel Prompt Rethink mechanism, which iteratively refines prompts
based on the generated images. This process not only fosters collaboration but
also increases image utilization and optimizes the prompts themselves.
Additionally, we present an Image-Agent (I-Agent) aimed at enriching the
overall data distribution. This agent augments the training set by generating
new instances conditioned on the training images. To ensure practicality and
efficiency, both agents operate as independent and automated workflows,
enhancing usability. Experiments conducted on the LVIS 1.0 validation set
indicate that InstaDA achieves significant improvements, with an increase of
+4.0 in box average precision (AP) and +3.3 in mask AP compared to the
baseline. Furthermore, it outperforms the leading model, DiverGen, by +0.3 in
box AP and +0.1 in mask AP, with a notable +0.7 gain in box AP on common
categories and mask AP gains of +0.2 on common categories and +0.5 on frequent
categories.

Conclusion: 该方法通过多粒度测量和查询引导的原型增强，有效解决了支持图像和查询图像之间存在显著差异时的匹配问题，提升了少样本医学图像分割的性能

Abstract: Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation (FSMIS) aims to segment novel classes of
medical objects using only a few labeled images. Prototype-based methods have
made significant progress in addressing FSMIS. However, they typically generate
a single global prototype for the support image to match with the query image,
overlooking intra-class variations. To address this issue, we propose a
Self-guided Prototype Enhancement Network (SPENet). Specifically, we introduce
a Multi-level Prototype Generation (MPG) module, which enables
multi-granularity measurement between the support and query images by
simultaneously generating a global prototype and an adaptive number of local
prototypes. Additionally, we observe that not all local prototypes in the
support image are beneficial for matching, especially when there are
substantial discrepancies between the support and query images. To alleviate
this issue, we propose a Query-guided Local Prototype Enhancement (QLPE)
module, which adaptively refines support prototypes by incorporating guidance
from the query image, thus mitigating the negative effects of such
discrepancies. Extensive experiments on three public medical datasets
demonstrate that SPENet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods,
achieving superior performance.

Result: SOPSeg在小目标分割方面优于现有方法，并支持高效构建遥感任务数据集

Conclusion: 该工作填补了小目标实例分割的研究空白，提出的框架和数据集将支持未来研究发展

Abstract: Extracting small objects from remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in
various applications, including urban planning, environmental monitoring, and
disaster management. While current research primarily focuses on small object
detection, instance segmentation for small objects remains underexplored, with
no dedicated datasets available. This gap stems from the technical challenges
and high costs of pixel-level annotation for small objects. While the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) demonstrates impressive zero-shot generalization, its
performance on small-object segmentation deteriorates significantly, largely
due to the coarse 1/16 feature resolution that causes severe loss of fine
spatial details. To this end, we propose SOPSeg, a prompt-based framework
specifically designed for small object segmentation in remote sensing imagery.
It incorporates a region-adaptive magnification strategy to preserve
fine-grained details, and employs a customized decoder that integrates edge
prediction and progressive refinement for accurate boundary delineation.
Moreover, we introduce a novel prompting mechanism tailored to the oriented
bounding boxes widely adopted in remote sensing applications. SOPSeg
outperforms existing methods in small object segmentation and facilitates
efficient dataset construction for remote sensing tasks. We further construct a
comprehensive small object instance segmentation dataset based on SODA-A, and
will release both the model and dataset to support future research.

Abstract: Recent studies on deep watermarking have predominantly focused on
in-processing watermarking, which integrates the watermarking process into
image generation. However, post-processing watermarking, which embeds
watermarks after image generation, offers more flexibility. It can be applied
to outputs from any generative model (e.g. GANs, diffusion models) without
needing access to the model's internal structure. It also allows users to embed
unique watermarks into individual images. Therefore, this study focuses on
post-processing watermarking and enhances its robustness by incorporating an
ensemble attack network during training. We construct various versions of
attack networks using CNN and Transformer in both spatial and frequency domains
to investigate how each combination influences the robustness of the
watermarking model. Our results demonstrate that combining a CNN-based attack
network in the spatial domain with a Transformer-based attack network in the
frequency domain yields the highest robustness in watermarking models.
Extensive evaluation on the WAVES benchmark, using average bit accuracy as the
metric, demonstrates that our ensemble attack network significantly enhances
the robustness of baseline watermarking methods under various stress tests. In
particular, for the Regeneration Attack defined in WAVES, our method improves
StegaStamp by 18.743%. The code is released

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在处理视觉和文本联合输入时，经常错误地将缺乏视觉证据的文本输入误认为是图像内容，导致错误响应。需要探究模型是否具备判断文本概念是否基于图像的能力。

Method: 识别出特定的前馈网络神经元(VA神经元)，这些神经元通过独特的激活模式持续指示视觉缺失。基于此开发检测模块来系统分类输入token是否基于视觉，并通过重新解释问题提示或在生成过程中替换检测到的缺失token来优化输出。

Result: 实验表明该方法有效缓解了模型错误假定文本输入具有视觉存在的倾向，并在各种LVLMs中具有通用性。

Conclusion: 通过识别VA神经元和开发相应的检测修正方法，能够显著改善大型视觉语言模型在处理视觉缺失文本时的表现，提高模型的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) generate contextually relevant responses
by jointly interpreting visual and textual inputs. However, our finding reveals
they often mistakenly perceive text inputs lacking visual evidence as being
part of the image, leading to erroneous responses. In light of this finding, we
probe whether LVLMs possess an internal capability to determine if textual
concepts are grounded in the image, and discover a specific subset of
Feed-Forward Network (FFN) neurons, termed Visual Absence-aware (VA) neurons,
that consistently signal the visual absence through a distinctive activation
pattern. Leveraging these patterns, we develop a detection module that
systematically classifies whether an input token is visually grounded. Guided
by its prediction, we propose a method to refine the outputs by reinterpreting
question prompts or replacing the detected absent tokens during generation.
Extensive experiments show that our method effectively mitigates the models'
tendency to falsely presume the visual presence of text input and its
generality across various LVLMs.

Conclusion: 背景语义信息对行人重识别至关重要，提出的联合建模框架能有效抑制噪声背景区域并增强对身份相关前景线索的关注

Abstract: Person re-identification faces two core challenges: precisely locating the
foreground target while suppressing background noise and extracting
fine-grained features from the target region. Numerous visual-only approaches
address these issues by partitioning an image and applying attention modules,
yet they rely on costly manual annotations and struggle with complex
occlusions. Recent multimodal methods, motivated by CLIP, introduce semantic
cues to guide visual understanding. However, they focus solely on foreground
information, but overlook the potential value of background cues. Inspired by
human perception, we argue that background semantics are as important as the
foreground semantics in ReID, as humans tend to eliminate background
distractions while focusing on target appearance. Therefore, this paper
proposes an end-to-end framework that jointly models foreground and background
information within a dual-branch cross-modal feature extraction pipeline. To
help the network distinguish between the two domains, we propose an
intra-semantic alignment and inter-semantic adversarial learning strategy.
Specifically, we align visual and textual features that share the same
semantics across domains, while simultaneously penalizing similarity between
foreground and background features to enhance the network's discriminative
power. This strategy drives the model to actively suppress noisy background
regions and enhance attention toward identity-relevant foreground cues.
Comprehensive experiments on two holistic and two occluded ReID benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method, with
results that match or surpass those of current state-of-the-art approaches.

Mobile Inverted Bottleneck blocks to curb computation, inserts a

Conclusion: 动态条件双温度桥范式能够有效解决不良多份务问题，通过解耦温度和条件生成过程，以及使用动态条件来提升网络学习效果。

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have made impressive progress in the field of
image processing, but the characteristics of constructing data distribution
pathways make it difficult to exploit the intrinsic correlation between tasks
in multi-task scenarios, which is even worse in ill-posed tasks with a lack of
training data. In addition, traditional static condition control makes it
difficult for networks to learn in multi-task scenarios with its dynamically
evolving characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic
conditional double diffusion bridge training paradigm to build a general
framework for ill-posed multi-tasks. Firstly, this paradigm decouples the
diffusion and condition generation processes, avoiding the dependence of the
diffusion model on supervised data in ill-posed tasks. Secondly, generated by
the same noise schedule, dynamic conditions are used to gradually adjust their
statistical characteristics, naturally embed time-related information, and
reduce the difficulty of network learning. We analyze the learning objectives
of the network under different conditional forms in the single-step denoising
process and compare the changes in its attention weights in the network,
demonstrating the superiority of our dynamic conditions. Taking dehazing and
visible-infrared fusion as typical ill-posed multi-task scenarios, we achieve
the best performance in multiple indicators on public datasets. The code has

Conclusion: ADA-GAN通过生成对抗网络生成高质量训练数据，有效提升了对复杂手写字符的分类性能，为手写字符识别提供了更稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Handwritten characters can be trickier to classify due to their complex and
cursive nature compared to simple and non-cursive characters. We present an
external classifier along with a Generative Adversarial Network that can
classify highly cursive and complex characters. The generator network produces
fake handwritten character images, which are then used to augment the training
data after adding adversarially perturbed noise and achieving a confidence
score above a threshold with the discriminator network. The results show that
the accuracy of convolutional neural networks decreases as character complexity
increases, but our proposed model, ADA-GAN, remains more robust and effective
for both cursive and complex characters.

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms pose a significant clinical risk yet are difficult to

cross-domain feature-transfer approach that leverages the latent geometric
embeddings learned by TRELLIS, a generative model trained on large-scale
non-medical 3D datasets, to augment neural networks for aneurysm analysis. By
replacing conventional point normals or mesh descriptors with TRELLIS surface
features, we systematically enhance three downstream tasks: (i) classifying
aneurysms versus healthy vessels in the Intra3D dataset, (ii) segmenting
aneurysm and vessel regions on 3D meshes, and (iii) predicting time-evolving
blood-flow fields using a graph neural network on the AnXplore dataset. Our
experiments show that the inclusion of these features yields strong gains in
accuracy, F1-score and segmentation quality over state-of-the-art baselines,
and reduces simulation error by 15\%. These results illustrate the broader
potential of transferring 3D representations from general-purpose generative
models to specialized medical tasks.

Abstract: Face recognition systems are robust against environmental changes and noise,
and thus may be vulnerable to illegal authentication attempts using user face
photos, such as spoofing attacks. To prevent such spoofing attacks, it is
crucial to discriminate whether the input image is a live user image or a
spoofed image prior to the face recognition process. Most existing spoofing
attack detection methods utilize deep learning, which necessitates a
substantial amount of training data. Consequently, if malicious data is
injected into a portion of the training dataset, a specific spoofing attack may
be erroneously classified as live, leading to false positives.In this paper, we
propose a novel backdoor poisoning attack method to demonstrate the latent
threat of backdoor poisoning within face anti-spoofing detection. The proposed
method enables certain spoofing attacks to bypass detection by embedding
features extracted from the spoofing attack's face image into a live face image
without inducing any perceptible visual alterations.Through experiments
conducted on public datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method
constitutes a realistic threat to existing spoofing attack detection systems.

TL;DR: CAIM-Net是一个从变化时刻推断变化区域的时间序列变化检测网络，通过三个关键步骤确保变化区域和变化时刻结果的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习方法将变化区域检测和变化时刻识别作为独立任务处理，但变化区域可以从变化时刻推断出来，因此需要确保两者结果的一致性。

Method: 采用三步法：1)差异提取与增强，使用轻量编码器和边界增强卷积；2)粗粒度变化时刻提取，进行时空相关性分析；3)细粒度变化时刻提取和变化区域推断，使用多尺度时间CAM模块。

Result: 提出的CAIM-Net网络能够从变化时刻推断变化区域，确保了两者结果的一致性。

Conclusion: CAIM-Net通过利用时间序列分析和空间变化检测之间的内在关系，实现了从变化时刻到变化区域的有效推断，为时间序列变化检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series change detection is a critical task for exploring ecosystem
dynamics using time series remote sensing images, because it can simultaneously
indicate where and when change occur. While deep learning has shown excellent
performance in this domain, it continues to approach change area detection and
change moment identification as distinct tasks. Given that change area can be
inferred from change moment, we propose a time series change detection network,
named CAIM-Net (Change Area Inference from Moment Network), to ensure
consistency between change area and change moment results. CAIM-Net infers
change area from change moment based on the intrinsic relationship between time
series analysis and spatial change detection. The CAIM-Net comprises three key
steps: Difference Extraction and Enhancement, Coarse Change Moment Extraction,
and Fine Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference. In the Difference
Extraction and Enhancement, a lightweight encoder with batch dimension stacking
is designed to rapidly extract difference features. Subsequently, boundary
enhancement convolution is applied to amplify these difference features. In the
Coarse Change Moment Extraction, the enhanced difference features from the
first step are used to spatiotemporal correlation analysis, and then two
distinct methods are employed to determine coarse change moments. In the Fine
Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference, a multiscale temporal Class
Activation Mapping (CAM) module first increases the weight of the
change-occurring moment from coarse change moments. Then the weighted change
moment is used to infer change area based on the fact that pixels with the
change moment must have undergone a change.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于梯度自反思的token影响估计方法，通过影响感知对比解码框架同时缓解多模态大语言模型中的文本-视觉偏差和共现偏差，无需额外资源即可有效减少幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型存在文本-视觉偏差和共现偏差导致的幻觉问题，现有方法缺乏对实例间偏差水平波动的理解，需要更精准的偏差缓解方案。

Method: 使用基于梯度的自反思方法估计不同token类型（视觉、提示、先前输出）的影响，检测物体相关视觉token，并将其整合到影响感知对比解码框架中。

Result: 在LLaVA-QA90上实现了高达92%的准确率提升，有效减少了幻觉现象。

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外微调、模型或数据统计，能够同时缓解两种偏差类型，为多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language model are caused by the
text-visual bias and the co-occurrence bias. The former reflects an
over-reliance on text information in the decision-making process, while the
latter arises from the statistical object-pairing patterns abstracted from the
training data. Existing mitigation methods heuristically address these biases
without understanding the fluctuating bias level across the instances. We first
propose estimating the influence of respective token types (visual, prompt, and
previous outputs) using a gradient-based self-reflection method. The estimated
token influence further enables the detection of object-related visual tokens
and their integration into an influence-aware contrastive decoding framework to
mitigate both types of biases simultaneously. Our method operates without the
need for additional resources, such as costly fine-tuning, extra models, or
data statistics. Extensive experiments show it effectively reduces
hallucinations, achieving up to a 92% accuracy increase on LLaVA-QA90.

Motivation: 现有手-物体姿态估计方法在处理复杂几何形状时存在穿透、接触间隙问题，且难以捕捉手部表面的真实变形

Method: 将手-物体交互建模为引力场驱动的过程，使用Gravity-Field Based Diffusion Bridge模拟可变形手部表面与刚性物体的交互，并整合文本语义信息指导引力场构建

Result: 方法有效解决了穿透问题，确保稳定抓握，捕捉真实手部变形，在多个数据集上的定性和定量实验证明了其有效性

Conclusion: GravityDB方法能够生成物理合理、无穿透、语义有意义的手-物体交互，显著提升了交互状态的重建质量

Abstract: Existing reconstruction or hand-object pose estimation methods are capable of
producing coarse interaction states. However, due to the complex and diverse
geometry of both human hands and objects, these approaches often suffer from
interpenetration or leave noticeable gaps in regions that are supposed to be in
contact. Moreover, the surface of a real human hand undergoes non-negligible
deformations during interaction, which are difficult to capture and represent
with previous methods. To tackle these challenges, we formulate hand-object
interaction as an attraction-driven process and propose a Gravity-Field Based
Diffusion Bridge (GravityDB) to simulate interactions between a deformable hand
surface and rigid objects. Our approach effectively resolves the aforementioned
issues by generating physically plausible interactions that are free of
interpenetration, ensure stable grasping, and capture realistic hand
deformations. Furthermore, we incorporate semantic information from textual
descriptions to guide the construction of the gravitational field, enabling
more semantically meaningful interaction regions. Extensive qualitative and
quantitative experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method.

Motivation: 现有方法存在三个主要局限：无法明确捕捉结构变化与时间间隔的关系、仅依赖扫描插值缺乏临床实用性、以及大多基于2D切片架构忽略完整3D解剖上下文。需要开发能够准确预测脑部病理进展的3D方法。

Method: 使用预训练的脑龄估计器(BAE)指导扩散模型生成准确反映预期年龄差异的MRI；提出Back-In-Time正则化(BITR)，通过双向训练（从基线到随访的前向预测和从随访到基线的后向预测）提高时间感知能力。

Result: 在OASIS-3数据集上训练和评估，并在NACC数据集的外部测试集上验证了泛化性能。

Conclusion: TADM-3D能够准确预测脑部MRI的进展，通过时间感知机制和双向正则化解决了现有方法的局限性，为临床评估疾病进展提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Generating realistic MRIs to accurately predict future changes in the
structure of brain is an invaluable tool for clinicians in assessing clinical
outcomes and analysing the disease progression at the patient level. However,
current existing methods present some limitations: (i) some approaches fail to
explicitly capture the relationship between structural changes and time
intervals, especially when trained on age-imbalanced datasets; (ii) others rely
only on scan interpolation, which lack clinical utility, as they generate
intermediate images between timepoints rather than future pathological
progression; and (iii) most approaches rely on 2D slice-based architectures,
thereby disregarding full 3D anatomical context, which is essential for
accurate longitudinal predictions. We propose a 3D Temporally-Aware Diffusion
Model (TADM-3D), which accurately predicts brain progression on MRI volumes. To
better model the relationship between time interval and brain changes, TADM-3D
uses a pre-trained Brain-Age Estimator (BAE) that guides the diffusion model in
the generation of MRIs that accurately reflect the expected age difference
between baseline and generated follow-up scans. Additionally, to further
improve the temporal awareness of TADM-3D, we propose the Back-In-Time
Regularisation (BITR), by training TADM-3D to predict bidirectionally from the
baseline to follow-up (forward), as well as from the follow-up to baseline
(backward). Although predicting past scans has limited clinical applications,
this regularisation helps the model generate temporally more accurate scans. We
train and evaluate TADM-3D on the OASIS-3 dataset, and we validate the
generalisation performance on an external test set from the NACC dataset. The
code will be available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出了两种新的损失函数（负中心线损失和简化拓扑损失）来保持生物医学分割中细长结构的连续性，特别是在信号缺失区域，显著减少了分割不连续性并改善了实例长度计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在生物医学分割任务中，保持细长结构的连续性和长度比体素级精度更重要，特别是对于容易因信号丢失而产生不连续性的任务。

Method: 提出了负中心线损失和简化拓扑损失两种新损失函数，结合CNN使用，并讨论了实验设计特征如下采样和间距校正来获得连续分割掩码。

Result: 在3D光片荧光显微镜轴突起始段数据集上评估，相比标准CNN和现有拓扑感知损失，新方法显著减少了每个实例的分割不连续性，特别是在输入信号缺失区域，改善了实例长度计算。

Conclusion: 损失函数设计中嵌入的结构先验可以显著提高生物应用分割的可靠性。

Abstract: In many biomedical segmentation tasks, the preservation of elongated
structure continuity and length is more important than voxel-wise accuracy. We
propose two novel loss functions, Negative Centerline Loss and Simplified
Topology Loss, that, applied to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), help
preserve connectivity of output instances. Moreover, we discuss characteristics
of experiment design, such as downscaling and spacing correction, that help
obtain continuous segmentation masks. We evaluate our approach on a 3D
light-sheet fluorescence microscopy dataset of axon initial segments (AIS), a
task prone to discontinuity due to signal dropout. Compared to standard CNNs
and existing topology-aware losses, our methods reduce the number of
segmentation discontinuities per instance, particularly in regions with missing
input signal, resulting in improved instance length calculation in downstream
applications. Our findings demonstrate that structural priors embedded in the
loss design can significantly enhance the reliability of segmentation for
biological applications.

Conclusion: Count2Density方法能够有效解决仅使用计数标注进行人群密度估计的挑战，通过创新的流水线设计实现了从简单标签中提取空间信息的能力，为实际应用提供了更可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Crowd density estimation is a well-known computer vision task aimed at
estimating the density distribution of people in an image. The main challenge
in this domain is the reliance on fine-grained location-level annotations,
(i.e. points placed on top of each individual) to train deep networks.
Collecting such detailed annotations is both tedious, time-consuming, and poses
a significant barrier to scalability for real-world applications. To alleviate
this burden, we present Count2Density: a novel pipeline designed to predict
meaningful density maps containing quantitative spatial information using only
count-level annotations (i.e., total number of people) during training. To
achieve this, Count2Density generates pseudo-density maps leveraging past
predictions stored in a Historical Map Bank, thereby reducing confirmation
bias. This bank is initialised using an unsupervised saliency estimator to
provide an initial spatial prior and is iteratively updated with an EMA of
predicted density maps. These pseudo-density maps are obtained by sampling
locations from estimated crowd areas using a hypergeometric distribution, with
the number of samplings determined by the count-level annotations. To further
enhance the spatial awareness of the model, we add a self-supervised
contrastive spatial regulariser to encourage similar feature representations
within crowded regions while maximising dissimilarity with background regions.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
cross-domain adaptation methods and achieves better results than recent
state-of-the-art approaches in semi-supervised settings across several
datasets. Additional analyses validate the effectiveness of each individual
component of our pipeline, confirming the ability of Count2Density to
effectively retrieve spatial information from count-level annotations and
enabling accurate subregion counting.

Conclusion: 军事领域需要大型代表性数据集来进一步评估投毒攻击风险和补丁检测机会；AutoDetect方法为投毒检测提供了简单高效的解决方案，但需要更多数据支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Poisoning attacks pose an increasing threat to the security and robustness of
Artificial Intelligence systems in the military domain. The widespread use of
open-source datasets and pretrained models exacerbates this risk. Despite the
severity of this threat, there is limited research on the application and
detection of poisoning attacks on object detection systems. This is especially
problematic in the military domain, where attacks can have grave consequences.
In this work, we both investigate the effect of poisoning attacks on military
object detectors in practice, and the best approach to detect these attacks. To
support this research, we create a small, custom dataset featuring military
vehicles: MilCivVeh. We explore the vulnerability of military object detectors
for poisoning attacks by implementing a modified version of the BadDet attack:
a patch-based poisoning attack. We then assess its impact, finding that while a
positive attack success rate is achievable, it requires a substantial portion
of the data to be poisoned -- raising questions about its practical
applicability. To address the detection challenge, we test both specialized
poisoning detection methods and anomaly detection methods from the visual
industrial inspection domain. Since our research shows that both classes of
methods are lacking, we introduce our own patch detection method: AutoDetect, a
simple, fast, and lightweight autoencoder-based method. Our method shows
promising results in separating clean from poisoned samples using the
reconstruction error of image slices, outperforming existing methods, while
being less time- and memory-intensive. We urge that the availability of large,
representative datasets in the military domain is a prerequisite to further
evaluate risks of poisoning attacks and opportunities patch detection.

Conclusion: 该方法为LDCT成像提供了更安全和准确的解决方案，具有应用前景

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is critical for minimizing radiation
exposure, but it often leads to increased noise and reduced image quality.
Traditional denoising methods, such as iterative optimization or supervised
learning, often fail to preserve image quality. To address these challenges, we
introduce PPORLD-EDNetLDCT, a reinforcement learning-based (RL) approach with
Encoder-Decoder for LDCT. Our method utilizes a dynamic RL-based approach in
which an advanced posterior policy optimization (PPO) algorithm is used to
optimize denoising policies in real time, based on image quality feedback,
trained via a custom gym environment. The experimental results on the low dose
CT image and projection dataset demonstrate that the proposed PPORLD-EDNetLDCT
model outperforms traditional denoising techniques and other DL-based methods,
achieving a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 41.87, a structural similarity index
measure of 0.9814 and a root mean squared error of 0.00236. Moreover, in
NIH-AAPM-Mayo Clinic Low Dose CT Challenge dataset our method achived a PSNR of
41.52, SSIM of 0.9723 and RMSE of 0.0051. Furthermore, we validated the quality
of denoising using a classification task in the COVID-19 LDCT dataset, where
the images processed by our method improved the classification accuracy to
94\%, achieving 4\% higher accuracy compared to denoising without RL-based
denoising. This method offers a promising solution for safer and more accurate
LDCT imaging.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved
natural language understanding and generation, enhancing Human-Computer

lack the ability to interpret emotional cues from non-verbal signals, hindering
more immersive and empathetic interactions. This work explores integrating
multimodal sentiment perception into LLMs to create emotion-aware agents. We
propose \ours, an AI-based virtual companion that captures multimodal sentiment
cues, enabling emotionally aligned and animated HCI. \ours introduces a
Multimodal Sentiment Perception Network (MSPN) using a cross-modal fusion
transformer and supervised contrastive learning to provide emotional cues.
Additionally, we develop an emotion-aware prompt engineering strategy for
generating empathetic responses and integrate a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system and
animated avatar module for expressive interactions. \ours provides a framework
for emotion-aware agents with applications in companion robotics, social care,
mental health, and human-centered AI.

Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a powerful tool for probing
brain function, yet reliable clinical diagnosis is hampered by low
signal-to-noise ratios, inter-subject variability, and the limited frequency
awareness of prevailing CNN- and Transformer-based models. Moreover, most fMRI
datasets lack textual annotations that could contextualize regional activation
and connectivity patterns. We introduce RTGMFF, a framework that unifies
automatic ROI-level text generation with multimodal feature fusion for
brain-disorder diagnosis. RTGMFF consists of three components: (i) ROI-driven
fMRI text generation deterministically condenses each subject's activation,
connectivity, age, and sex into reproducible text tokens; (ii) Hybrid
frequency-spatial encoder fuses a hierarchical wavelet-mamba branch with a
cross-scale Transformer encoder to capture frequency-domain structure alongside
long-range spatial dependencies; and (iii) Adaptive semantic alignment module
embeds the ROI token sequence and visual features in a shared space, using a
regularized cosine-similarity loss to narrow the modality gap. Extensive
experiments on the ADHD-200 and ABIDE benchmarks show that RTGMFF surpasses
current methods in diagnostic accuracy, achieving notable gains in sensitivity,
specificity, and area under the ROC curve. Code is available at

as breast tumor segmentation in MRI with a large field-of-view (FOV), while
commonly used tumor generation methods are based on small patches. In this
paper, we propose a 3D medical diffusion model, called SynBT, to generate
high-quality breast tumor (BT) in contrast-enhanced MRI images. The proposed
model consists of a patch-to-volume autoencoder, which is able to compress the
high-resolution MRIs into compact latent space, while preserving the resolution
of volumes with large FOV. Using the obtained latent space feature vector, a
mask-conditioned diffusion model is used to synthesize breast tumors within
selected regions of breast tissue, resulting in realistic tumor appearances. We
evaluated the proposed method for a tumor segmentation task, which demonstrated
the proposed high-quality tumor synthesis method can facilitate the common
segmentation models with performance improvement of 2-3% Dice Score on a large
public dataset, and therefore provides benefits for tumor segmentation in MRI
images.

*Qihang Zhou,Shibo He,Jiangtao Yan,Wenchao Meng,Jiming Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出PointAD+框架，通过结合点云和像素级信息，将CLIP的2D异常检测能力转移到3D领域，实现了在未见对象上的零样本3D异常检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将CLIP模型在2D图像上的强大异常检测能力扩展到3D领域，解决在高度多样化类别语义的未见对象上进行3D异常检测的挑战。

Method: 提出PointAD+统一框架：1)设计PointAD通过点-像素对应关系表征隐式3D异常；2)PointAD+引入显式3D表征强调空间异常关系；3)采用G-aggregation涵盖几何信息；4)分层表征学习结合隐式和显式异常语义；5)跨层次对比对齐促进层间交互。

Result: 大量实验证明PointAD+在零样本3D异常检测任务中表现优异，能够在高度多样化类别语义的未见对象上实现全面的异常理解。

Conclusion: PointAD+通过结合隐式和显式3D表征方法，成功将CLIP的2D异常检测能力转移到3D领域，为零样本3D异常检测提供了一个统一的框架。

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to transfer CLIP's robust 2D generalization
capabilities to identify 3D anomalies across unseen objects of highly diverse
class semantics. To this end, we propose a unified framework to comprehensively
detect and segment 3D anomalies by leveraging both point- and pixel-level
information. We first design PointAD, which leverages point-pixel
correspondence to represent 3D anomalies through their associated rendering
pixel representations. This approach is referred to as implicit 3D
representation, as it focuses solely on rendering pixel anomalies but neglects
the inherent spatial relationships within point clouds. Then, we propose
PointAD+ to further broaden the interpretation of 3D anomalies by introducing
explicit 3D representation, emphasizing spatial abnormality to uncover abnormal
spatial relationships. Hence, we propose G-aggregation to involve geometry
information to enable the aggregated point representations spatially aware. To
simultaneously capture rendering and spatial abnormality, PointAD+ proposes
hierarchical representation learning, incorporating implicit and explicit
anomaly semantics into hierarchical text prompts: rendering prompts for the
rendering layer and geometry prompts for the geometry layer. A cross-hierarchy
contrastive alignment is further introduced to promote the interaction between
the rendering and geometry layers, facilitating mutual anomaly learning.
Finally, PointAD+ integrates anomaly semantics from both layers to capture the
generalized anomaly semantics. During the test, PointAD+ can integrate RGB
information in a plug-and-play manner and further improve its detection
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PointAD+ in
ZS 3D anomaly detection across unseen objects with highly diverse class
semantics, achieving a holistic understanding of abnormality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索验证奖励强化学习在参数量少于70亿的轻量级多模态语言模型中的有效性，研究长思维链数据对提升此类模型推理能力的作用

Method: 使用长思维链数据进行监督微调(SFT)，然后在SFT基础上进行强化学习(RL)阶段

Result: 长思维链数据的SFT显著提升MLLM推理能力，后续RL阶段可带来额外性能增益

Conclusion: 使用长思维链数据的SFT阶段是开发轻量级MLLM推理能力的关键前提条件

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards has enhanced the
reasoning of large-scale language models (LLMs), its efficacy for lightweight
multimodal language models (MLLMs) with fewer than seven billion parameters
remains underexplored. This paper investigates the role of long
Chain-of-Thought (long CoT) data in enhancing the reasoning abilities of such
MLLMs. Our findings demonstrate that Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with long CoT
data significantly improves MLLM reasoning. Furthermore, we observe that after
this initial SFT phase, MLLMs can achieve additional performance gains through
a subsequent RL stage. We conclude that a SFT stage with long CoT data is a
critical prerequisite for developing the reasoning capabilities of lightweight
MLLMs.

Conclusion: 混合CNN-Transformer械架在稳健的星形粒细胞检测方面具有很大潜力，为进阶计算病理学工具的开发奠定了基础。

Abstract: Astrocytes are critical glial cells whose altered morphology and density are
hallmarks of many neurological disorders. However, their intricate branching
and stain dependent variability make automated detection of histological images
a highly challenging task. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid CNN
Transformer detector that combines local feature extraction with global
contextual reasoning. A heatmap guided query mechanism generates spatially
grounded anchors for small and faint astrocytes, while a lightweight
Transformer module improves discrimination in dense clusters. Evaluated on
ALDH1L1 and GFAP stained astrocyte datasets, the model consistently
outperformed Faster R-CNN, YOLOv11 and DETR, achieving higher sensitivity with
fewer false positives, as confirmed by FROC analysis. These results highlight
the potential of hybrid CNN Transformer architectures for robust astrocyte
detection and provide a foundation for advanced computational pathology tools.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfraDiffusion是一个零样本框架，通过虚拟相机将砖石点云转换为深度图，并使用DDNM进行恢复，显著提升了砖块级分割性能，特别适用于低光照环境下的基础设施检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低光照环境（如砖石隧道）中获取高分辨率RGB图像不切实际，而点云虽然对暗光环境鲁棒，但通常是非结构化、稀疏且有噪声的，限制了细粒度分割。

Method: 提出InfraDiffusion框架：1）使用虚拟相机将砖石点云投影为深度图；2）采用去噪扩散零空间模型（DDNM）进行恢复；3）无需任务特定训练即可增强深度图的视觉清晰度和几何一致性；4）使用Segment Anything Model（SAM）进行砖块级分割。

Result: 在砖石桥梁和隧道点云数据集上的实验表明，该方法在砖块级分割方面取得了显著改进，证明了其在砖石资产自动化检测中的潜力。

Conclusion: InfraDiffusion提供了一种有效的零样本解决方案，能够克服低光照环境下点云数据的局限性，为基础设施监测中的精细缺陷检测提供了新途径。

Abstract: Point clouds are widely used for infrastructure monitoring by providing
geometric information, where segmentation is required for downstream tasks such
as defect detection. Existing research has automated semantic segmentation of
structural components, while brick-level segmentation (identifying defects such
as spalling and mortar loss) has been primarily conducted from RGB images.
However, acquiring high-resolution images is impractical in low-light
environments like masonry tunnels. Point clouds, though robust to dim lighting,
are typically unstructured, sparse, and noisy, limiting fine-grained
segmentation. We present InfraDiffusion, a zero-shot framework that projects
masonry point clouds into depth maps using virtual cameras and restores them by
adapting the Denoising Diffusion Null-space Model (DDNM). Without task-specific
training, InfraDiffusion enhances visual clarity and geometric consistency of
depth maps. Experiments on masonry bridge and tunnel point cloud datasets show
significant improvements in brick-level segmentation using the Segment Anything
Model (SAM), underscoring its potential for automated inspection of masonry
assets. Our code and data is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法难以同时表征全局依赖和局部一致性，无法兼顾长程交互和边界细节的保持

Method: 使用Transformer捕获全局依赖，引入内容自适应图神经网络增强局部关系，集成多传播阶次动态学习图结构，采用图残差机制保持全局信息

Result: 实验结果表明该方法优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: T-CAGU框架有效解决了高光谱解混中全局与局部特征平衡的问题，具有鲁棒性和训练稳定性

Abstract: Hyperspectral unmixing (HU) targets to decompose each mixed pixel in remote
sensing images into a set of endmembers and their corresponding abundances.
Despite significant progress in this field using deep learning, most methods
fail to simultaneously characterize global dependencies and local consistency,
making it difficult to preserve both long-range interactions and boundary
details. This letter proposes a novel transformer-guided content-adaptive graph
unmixing framework (T-CAGU), which overcomes these challenges by employing a
transformer to capture global dependencies and introducing a content-adaptive
graph neural network to enhance local relationships. Unlike previous work,
T-CAGU integrates multiple propagation orders to dynamically learn the graph
structure, ensuring robustness against noise. Furthermore, T-CAGU leverages a
graph residual mechanism to preserve global information and stabilize training.
Experimental results demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-art
methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/T-CAGU.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers在图像分类中表现优异但计算成本高昂，需要在不牺牲精度的情况下降低大ViT模型的推理成本。

Method: 使用轻量级视觉模型在推理时估计token重要性，指导大型ViT选择性丢弃低重要性token，无需修改架构或重新训练。

Result: 在标准图像分类基准测试中，FLOPs减少高达80%，精度损失极小，展现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: TinyDrop框架为高效ViT分类提供了实用解决方案，具有即插即用、架构无关的优点，显著提升计算效率。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve strong performance in image classification
but incur high computational costs from processing all image tokens. To reduce
inference costs in large ViTs without compromising accuracy, we propose
TinyDrop, a training-free token dropping framework guided by a lightweight
vision model. The guidance model estimates the importance of tokens while
performing inference, thereby selectively discarding low-importance tokens if
large vit models need to perform attention calculations. The framework operates
plug-and-play, requires no architectural modifications, and is compatible with
diverse ViT architectures. Evaluations on standard image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that our framework reduces FLOPs by up to 80% for ViTs
with minimal accuracy degradation, highlighting its generalization capability
and practical utility for efficient ViT-based classification.

TL;DR: 提出D-GPTScore方法和CC-AlignBench标准数据集，用于评估多概念定制生成的人工智能对齐性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标无法全面评估多概念定制的保真度和概念互动，与人类偏好存在偏差

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型将评估标准分解为更细层面，构建包含单概念和多概念任务的标准数据集

Result: 在CC-AlignBench上显著超过现有方法，与人类偏好具有更高的相关性

Conclusion: 为概念定制评估建立了新标准，持续性研究面临关键挑战

Abstract: Evaluating concept customization is challenging, as it requires a
comprehensive assessment of fidelity to generative prompts and concept images.
Moreover, evaluating multiple concepts is considerably more difficult than
evaluating a single concept, as it demands detailed assessment not only for
each individual concept but also for the interactions among concepts. While
humans can intuitively assess generated images, existing metrics often provide
either overly narrow or overly generalized evaluations, resulting in
misalignment with human preference. To address this, we propose Decomposed GPT
Score (D-GPTScore), a novel human-aligned evaluation method that decomposes
evaluation criteria into finer aspects and incorporates aspect-wise assessments
using Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Additionally, we release Human
Preference-Aligned Concept Customization Benchmark (CC-AlignBench), a benchmark
dataset containing both single- and multi-concept tasks, enabling stage-wise
evaluation across a wide difficulty range -- from individual actions to
multi-person interactions. Our method significantly outperforms existing
approaches on this benchmark, exhibiting higher correlation with human
preferences. This work establishes a new standard for evaluating concept
customization and highlights key challenges for future research. The benchmark

Motivation: 临床设施中的模态数据在不同地点和患者之间存在差异，而乳腺癌分子分型作为重要的临床任务，能够从多模态数据整合中获得巨大改善。需要一种灵活可扩展的框架来处理不同模态的组合情况。

Method: 提出了一种可扩展的松耦合多模态框架，能够无缝整合CNV、临床记录和组织病理图像等多种模态数据。引入了双重表征方法来表示全手片图像(WSI)，结合传统的图像基于和图象基于表示。还提出了新的多模态融合策略。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的多模态框架不仅在乳腺癌分型中表现优异，而且具有良好的扩展性，能够轻松地适应其他类型的癌症。双重WSI表示方法和新的融合策略为多模态医疗应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Healthcare applications are inherently multimodal, benefiting greatly from
the integration of diverse data sources. However, the modalities available in
clinical settings can vary across different locations and patients. A key area
that stands to gain from multimodal integration is breast cancer molecular
subtyping, an important clinical task that can facilitate personalized
treatment and improve patient prognosis. In this work, we propose a scalable
and loosely-coupled multimodal framework that seamlessly integrates data from
various modalities, including copy number variation (CNV), clinical records,
and histopathology images, to enhance breast cancer subtyping. While our
primary focus is on breast cancer, our framework is designed to easily
accommodate additional modalities, offering the flexibility to scale up or down
with minimal overhead without requiring re-training of existing modalities,
making it applicable to other types of cancers as well. We introduce a
dual-based representation for whole slide images (WSIs), combining traditional
image-based and graph-based WSI representations. This novel dual approach
results in significant performance improvements. Moreover, we present a new
multimodal fusion strategy, demonstrating its ability to enhance performance
across a range of multimodal conditions. Our comprehensive results show that
integrating our dual-based WSI representation with CNV and clinical health
records, along with our pipeline and fusion strategy, outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in breast cancer subtyping.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Dense video captioning is a challenging video understanding task which aims
to simultaneously segment the video into a sequence of meaningful consecutive
events and to generate detailed captions to accurately describe each event.
Existing methods often encounter difficulties when working with the long videos
associated with dense video captioning, due to the computational complexity and
memory limitations. Furthermore, traditional approaches require the entire
video as input, in order to produce an answer, which precludes online
processing of the video. We address these challenges by time-scaling
State-Space Models (SSMs) to even longer sequences than before. Our approach,
State-Space Models with Transfer State, combines both the long-sequence and
recurrent properties of SSMs and addresses the main limitation of SSMs which
are otherwise not able to sustain their state for very long contexts,
effectively scaling SSMs further in time. The proposed model is particularly
suitable for generating captions on-the-fly, in an online or streaming manner,
without having to wait for the full video to be processed, which is more
beneficial in practice. When applied to dense video captioning, our approach
scales well with video lengths and uses 7x fewer FLOPs.

Motivation: 解决从低信噪比EEG信号中解码视觉神经表征的挑战，通过引入文本模态来增强EEG信号与视觉内容之间的语义对应关系。

Method: 提出了一个整合多模态的框架：1）使用适配器模块利用预训练表征；2）模态一致性动态平衡策略（MCDB）来调整各模态贡献权重；3）随机扰动正则化（SPR）来提高模型的泛化能力。

Result: 在ThingsEEG数据集上，方法在Top-1和Top-5准确率指标上分别提升2.0%和4.7%，超越了之前的最佳方法。

Conclusion: 通过多模态整各和创新的模态平衡策略，成功地从低信噪比EEG信号中解码了视觉神经表征，为神经科学研究提供了有效的方法。

Abstract: In this work, we propose an innovative framework that integrates EEG, image,
and text data, aiming to decode visual neural representations from low
signal-to-noise ratio EEG signals. Specifically, we introduce text modality to
enhance the semantic correspondence between EEG signals and visual content.
With the explicit semantic labels provided by text, image and EEG features of
the same category can be more closely aligned with the corresponding text
representations in a shared multimodal space. To fully utilize pre-trained
visual and textual representations, we propose an adapter module that
alleviates the instability of high-dimensional representation while
facilitating the alignment and fusion of cross-modal features. Additionally, to
alleviate the imbalance in multimodal feature contributions introduced by the
textual representations, we propose a Modal Consistency Dynamic Balance (MCDB)
strategy that dynamically adjusts the contribution weights of each modality. We
further propose a stochastic perturbation regularization (SPR) term to enhance
the generalization ability of semantic perturbation-based models by introducing
dynamic Gaussian noise in the modality optimization process. The evaluation
results on the ThingsEEG dataset show that our method surpasses previous
state-of-the-art methods in both Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy metrics, improving by
2.0\% and 4.7\% respectively.

Motivation: 针对边缘设备计算资源有限的实际场景，需要在不使用集成方法或测试时增强的情况下实现高效的道路缺陷检测。

Method: 提出JTGD方法，联合训练图像生成器和检测器，设计双判别器确保合成缺陷补丁和整体图像的真实性，使用CLIP-based FID损失提升图像质量。

Result: 在RDD2022基准测试中超越现有方法，参数量仅为竞争基线的20%以下，更适合边缘设备部署。

Conclusion: JTGD通过联合训练生成器和检测器，在有限资源下实现了高性能的道路缺陷检测，具有实际部署价值。

Abstract: Road defect detection is important for road authorities to reduce the vehicle
damage caused by road defects. Considering the practical scenarios where the
defect detectors are typically deployed on edge devices with limited memory and
computational resource, we aim at performing road defect detection without
using ensemble-based methods or test-time augmentation (TTA). To this end, we
propose to Jointly Train the image Generator and Detector for road defect
detection (dubbed as JTGD). We design the dual discriminators for the
generative model to enforce both the synthesized defect patches and overall
images to look plausible. The synthesized image quality is improved by our
proposed CLIP-based Fr\'echet Inception Distance loss. The generative model in
JTGD is trained jointly with the detector to encourage the generative model to
synthesize harder examples for the detector. Since harder synthesized images of
better quality caused by the aforesaid design are used in the data
augmentation, JTGD outperforms the state-of-the-art method in the RDD2022 road
defect detection benchmark across various countries under the condition of no
ensemble and TTA. JTGD only uses less than 20% of the number of parameters
compared with the competing baseline, which makes it more suitable for
deployment on edge devices in practice.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel parameter-efficient adaptation method for
No- Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) using visual prompts optimized
in pixel-space. Unlike full fine-tuning of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), our approach trains only 600K parameters at most (< 0.01% of the base
model), while keeping the underlying model fully frozen. During inference,
these visual prompts are combined with images via addition and processed by
mPLUG-Owl2 with the textual query "Rate the technical quality of the image."
Evaluations across distortion types (synthetic, realistic, AI-generated) on
KADID- 10k, KonIQ-10k, and AGIQA-3k demonstrate competitive performance against
full finetuned methods and specialized NR-IQA models, achieving 0.93 SRCC on
KADID-10k. To our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage pixel-space
visual prompts for NR-IQA, enabling efficient MLLM adaptation for low-level

Motivation: 现有统一多模态模型通常依赖外部视觉组件（如ViT或视觉分词器），导致推理效率低下，特别是处理高分辨率输入时。需要一种更简洁高效的架构来实现真正的统一多模态智能。

Conclusion: 纯自回归建模是统一多模态智能的充分且优雅的基础，OneCAT为此设定了新的性能标准，展示了该方法的强大潜力。

Abstract: We introduce OneCAT, a unified multimodal model that seamlessly integrates
understanding, generation, and editing within a novel, pure decoder-only
transformer architecture. Our framework uniquely eliminates the need for
external components such as Vision Transformers (ViT) or vision tokenizer
during inference, leading to significant efficiency gains, especially for
high-resolution inputs. This is achieved through a modality-specific
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure trained with a single autoregressive (AR)
objective, which also natively supports dynamic resolutions. Furthermore, we
pioneer a multi-scale visual autoregressive mechanism within the Large Language
Model (LLM) that drastically reduces decoding steps compared to diffusion-based
methods while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Our findings
demonstrate the powerful potential of pure autoregressive modeling as a
sufficient and elegant foundation for unified multimodal intelligence. As a
result, OneCAT sets a new performance standard, outperforming existing
open-source unified multimodal models across benchmarks for multimodal
generation, editing, and understanding.

Abstract: Benchmarking multi-object tracking and object detection model performance is
an essential step in machine learning model development, as it allows
researchers to evaluate model detection and tracker performance on
human-generated 'test' data, facilitating consistent comparisons between models
and trackers and aiding performance optimization. In this study, a novel

The dataset consists of four video sequences representing midwater and benthic
deep-sea habitats. Performance was evaluated using Higher Order Tracking
Accuracy, a metric that balances detection, localization, and association
accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available
benchmark for multi-object tracking in deep-sea video footage. We provide the
benchmark data, a clearly documented workflow for generating additional

Result: 使用Strefer生成数据训练的模型在需要时空消歧的任务上优于基线模型，并展现出增强的时空感知推理能力。

Conclusion: Strefer为感知基础的指令调优视频大语言模型建立了新的基础，能够提升AI伴侣在真实世界环境中的时空推理能力。

Abstract: Next-generation AI companions must go beyond general video understanding to
resolve spatial and temporal references in dynamic, real-world environments.
Existing Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs), while capable of
coarse-level comprehension, struggle with fine-grained, spatiotemporal
reasoning, especially when user queries rely on time-based event references for
temporal anchoring, or gestural cues for spatial anchoring to clarify object
references and positions. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce Strefer, a
synthetic instruction data generation framework designed to equip Video LLMs
with spatiotemporal referring and reasoning capabilities. Strefer produces
diverse instruction-tuning data using a data engine that pseudo-annotates
temporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and
temporal information in a structured manner, including subjects, objects, their
locations as masklets, and their action descriptions and timelines. Our
approach enhances the ability of Video LLMs to interpret spatial and temporal
references, fostering more versatile, space-time-aware reasoning essential for
real-world AI companions. Without using proprietary models, costly human
annotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental
evaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform
baselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation. Additionally,
these models exhibit enhanced space-time-aware reasoning, establishing a new
foundation for perceptually grounded, instruction-tuned Video LLMs.

Motivation: 目前缺乏研究笔迹遗传特性的数据库，需要建立一个全面的数据库来探索笔迹是否具有遗传成分、家庭关系如何影响笔迹风格等问题

Method: 收集210个家庭（包括祖父母、父母、叔伯姑姨、兄弟姐妹、堂表兄弟姐妹、侄子侄女等）的手写样本，包括数字、字母、形状和自由段落，使用专门设计的表格记录家庭关系

Result: 通过比较家庭成员笔迹特征，发现了他们之间的相似性和书写风格的关联性，建立了首个此类数据库

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive database for research and investigation
on the effects of inheritance on handwriting. A database has been created that
can be used to answer questions such as: Is there a genetic component to
handwriting? Is handwriting inherited? Do family relationships affect
handwriting? Varieties of samples of handwritten components such as: digits,
letters, shapes and free paragraphs of 210 families including (grandparents,
parents, uncles, aunts, siblings, cousins, nephews and nieces) have been
collected using specially designed forms, and family relationships of all
writers are captured. To the best of our knowledge, no such database is
presently available. Based on comparisons and investigation of features of
handwritings of family members, similarities among their features and writing
styles are detected. Our database is freely available to the pattern
recognition community and hope it will pave the way for investigations on the
effects of inheritance and family relationships on handwritings.

TL;DR: T2I-CoReBench是一个全面的文本到图像生成基准测试，评估模型的组合和推理能力，包含1080个复杂提示和13500个检查问题，发现当前模型在复杂场景中的组合能力有限，推理能力更是瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在评估文本到图像生成模型的组合和推理能力方面存在局限性，无法全面评估这些能力，且当前基准测试的场景密度低、推理简单，无法满足复杂真实场景的需求。

Method: 构建了一个12维评估分类法，围绕场景图元素（实例、属性、关系）构建组合能力评估，围绕哲学推理框架（演绎、归纳、溯因）构建推理能力评估，每个提示都配有检查清单来独立评估每个元素。

Result: 对27个当前T2I模型的实验显示，它们在复杂高密度场景中的组合能力仍然有限，而推理能力更是严重滞后，所有模型都难以从提示中推断隐含元素。

Conclusion: T2I-CoReBench提供了一个全面复杂的基准测试，揭示了当前T2I模型在组合和推理能力方面的局限性，特别是推理能力是关键的瓶颈，需要进一步研究和改进。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation aims to synthesize images from textual
prompts, which jointly specify what must be shown and imply what can be
inferred, thereby corresponding to two core capabilities: composition and
reasoning. However, with the emerging advances of T2I models in reasoning
beyond composition, existing benchmarks reveal clear limitations in providing
comprehensive evaluations across and within these capabilities. Meanwhile,
these advances also enable models to handle more complex prompts, whereas
current benchmarks remain limited to low scene density and simplified
one-to-one reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose T2I-CoReBench, a
comprehensive and complex benchmark that evaluates both composition and
reasoning capabilities of T2I models. To ensure comprehensiveness, we structure
composition around scene graph elements (instance, attribute, and relation) and
reasoning around the philosophical framework of inference (deductive,
inductive, and abductive), formulating a 12-dimensional evaluation taxonomy. To
increase complexity, driven by the inherent complexities of real-world
scenarios, we curate each prompt with high compositional density for
composition and multi-step inference for reasoning. We also pair each prompt
with a checklist that specifies individual yes/no questions to assess each
intended element independently to facilitate fine-grained and reliable
evaluation. In statistics, our benchmark comprises 1,080 challenging prompts
and around 13,500 checklist questions. Experiments across 27 current T2I models
reveal that their composition capability still remains limited in complex
high-density scenarios, while the reasoning capability lags even further behind
as a critical bottleneck, with all models struggling to infer implicit elements
from prompts. Our project page: https://t2i-corebench.github.io/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长文本生成中效率与质量之间的权衡问题，提高生成效率同时保持生成质量。

Method: 1. 动态专家调度机制：根据文本复杂度智能分配计算资源；2. 分层稀疏注意力机制：将计算复杂度从O(n²)降至O(n)；3. 软吸收引导优化策略：结合DPM-solver++减少扩散步骤。

Result: 在各种长文本生成基准测试中，DrDiff优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: DrDiff框架通过三项核心技术有效解决了长文本生成的效率-质量权衡问题，在多个基准测试中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: This paper introduces DrDiff, a novel framework for long-text generation that
overcomes the efficiency-quality trade-off through three core technologies.
First, we design a dynamic expert scheduling mechanism that intelligently
allocates computational resources during the diffusion process based on text
complexity, enabling more efficient handling of text generation tasks of
varying difficulty. Second, we introduce a Hierarchical Sparse Attention (HSA)
mechanism that adaptively adjusts attention patterns according to a variety of
input lengths, reducing computational complexity from O($n^2$) to O($n$) while
maintaining model performance. Finally, we propose a soft absorption guidance
optimization strategy that combines with DPM-solver++ to reduce diffusion
steps, significantly improving generation speed. Comprehensive experiments on
various long-text generation benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our
DrDiff over the existing SOTA methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然低秩适配(LoRA)在语音应用中广泛使用，但当前最先进的PEFT方法主要为语言和视觉任务而设计，在语音任务上缺乏充分验证。

Method: 在ESPnet中集成并基准测试多种PEFT方法，并提出结构化SVD导向(SSVD)精调方法，通过选择性旋转输入相关的右奇异向量来保持输出相关向量的语义映射。

Result: 在域假移语音识别任务（包括儿童语音和方言变体）上进行了评估，模型规模从0.1B到2B。SSVD方法能够以最少的可训练参数实现健壮的域适配和提升的效率。

Conclusion: 该研究为语音识别任务提供了全面的PEFT方法基准测试，并通过SSVD方法展示了在保持语义一致性的同时实现高效域适配的潜力。所有实现已开源以支持可复现性和未来研究。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a scalable solution for
adapting large foundation models. While low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is widely
used in speech applications, its state-of-the-art variants, e.g., VeRA, DoRA,
PiSSA, and SVFT, are developed mainly for language and vision tasks, with
limited validation in speech. This work presents the first comprehensive
integration and benchmarking of these PEFT methods within ESPnet. We further
introduce structured SVD-guided (SSVD) fine-tuning, which selectively rotates
input-associated right singular vectors while keeping output-associated vectors
fixed to preserve semantic mappings. This design enables robust domain
adaptation with minimal trainable parameters and improved efficiency. We
evaluate all methods on domain-shifted speech recognition tasks, including
child speech and dialectal variation, across model scales from 0.1B to 2B. All
implementations are released in ESPnet to support reproducibility and future
work.

Motivation: 探究大型语言模型在生成文本时如何构建关于不同种族女性的叙事，特别是揭示看似中立的文本背后潜藏的殖民化结构框架和历史不平等问题。

Method: 从2100个文本中应用计算方法对语义相似故事进行分组，结合机器学习技术和质性话语分析方法进行综合分析。

Result: 识别出三种主要话语表征：社会超越、祖先神话化和主观自我实现，发现语法连贯的文本实际上强化了历史上存在的不平等结构。

Conclusion: 研究提出了结合机器学习与质性分析的集成方法，揭示了语言模型文本生成中潜藏的殖民化叙事框架，对AI伦理和公平性具有重要启示。

Abstract: This study investigates how large language models, in particular LLaMA
3.2-3B, construct narratives about Black and white women in short stories
generated in Portuguese. From 2100 texts, we applied computational methods to
group semantically similar stories, allowing a selection for qualitative
analysis. Three main discursive representations emerge: social overcoming,
ancestral mythification and subjective self-realization. The analysis uncovers
how grammatically coherent, seemingly neutral texts materialize a crystallized,
colonially structured framing of the female body, reinforcing historical
inequalities. The study proposes an integrated approach, that combines machine
learning techniques with qualitative, manual discourse analysis.

TL;DR: 提出了IDEAlgin评估框架，通过"三选一"任务来评估LLM生成解释性标注与专家标注的相似性，发现基于向量的方法效果不佳，而LLM作为评判者能显著提升与专家判断的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM越来越多地应用于开放式解释性标注任务，但缺乏可扩展的方法来评估LLM生成标注与专家标注的相似性。

Method: 提出IDEAlgin基准测试范式，使用"三选一"三元组判断任务来捕捉专家相似性评分，并评估各种相似性指标（基于向量的方法和LLM作为评判者）。

Result: 基于向量的指标无法捕捉专家关注的细微相似性维度，而通过IDEAlgin提示的LLM相比传统方法显著提高了与专家判断的一致性（提升9-30%）。

Conclusion: IDEAlgin为大规模评估LLM在开放式专家标注任务中的表现提供了有前景的范式，有助于在教育等领域负责任地部署LLM。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to open-ended,
interpretive annotation tasks, such as thematic analysis by researchers or
generating feedback on student work by teachers. These tasks involve free-text
annotations requiring expert-level judgments grounded in specific objectives
(e.g., research questions or instructional goals). Evaluating whether
LLM-generated annotations align with those generated by expert humans is
challenging to do at scale, and currently, no validated, scalable measure of
similarity in ideas exists. In this paper, we (i) introduce the scalable
evaluation of interpretive annotation by LLMs as a critical and understudied
task, (ii) propose IDEAlgin, an intuitive benchmarking paradigm for capturing
expert similarity ratings via a "pick-the-odd-one-out" triplet judgment task,
and (iii) evaluate various similarity metrics, including vector-based ones
(topic models, embeddings) and LLM-as-a-judge via IDEAlgin, against these human
benchmarks. Applying this approach to two real-world educational datasets
(interpretive analysis and feedback generation), we find that vector-based
metrics largely fail to capture the nuanced dimensions of similarity meaningful
to experts. Prompting LLMs via IDEAlgin significantly improves alignment with
expert judgments (9-30% increase) compared to traditional lexical and
vector-based metrics. These results establish IDEAlgin as a promising paradigm
for evaluating LLMs against open-ended expert annotations at scale, informing
responsible deployment of LLMs in education and beyond.

Motivation: 解决阿拉伯语长上下文问答任务的挑战，提升阿拉伯语大视觉语言模型的理解能力，通过自动化流程减少人工干预。

Method: 使用问题生成器、评估器和答案生成器群组成防御性工作流程，通过闭环循环进行迭代精炼，质量指标可作为可调超参数控制问题难度。

Result: 构建了AraLongBench大规模阿拉伯语指标数据集，证明自我迭代流程显著超过静态流程，大幅提升了阿拉伯语LVLM的长上下文理解能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为阿拉伯语长文档处理提供了高效的自动化解决方案，通过自我迭代和质量控制机制，能够持续改善模型性能。

Abstract: We present an end-to-end, self-evolving adversarial workflow for long-context
Question-Answer (QA) Generation in Arabic. By orchestrating multiple
specialized LVLMs: a question generator, an evaluator, and a swarm of answer
generators, our system iteratively refines its own performance without any
human intervention. Starting from raw, multi-page Arabic documents across
diverse domains, the question generator produces fine-grained, context-aware
queries to be tackled by the answer generator swarm, and the evaluator assesses
and feeds back quality metrics. This closed-loop cycle enables continuous
learning: low-confidence outputs trigger automated re-generation and model
updates, progressively enhancing question difficulty and relevance. Moreover,
we set the quality metrics as a tunable hyperparameter, enabling question
generation at controllable and customizable difficulty levels. We release
AraLongBench, a large-scale Arabic benchmark of single- and multi-page
challenges spanning hundreds of pages, and demonstrate that our self-evolving
workflow substantially outperform static pipelines, markedly boosting the
long-context comprehension capabilities of leading Arabic Large Vision Language
Models (LVLMs). Lastly, we also meticulously architect a fully automated
agentic workflow for long-context Arabic document collection.

Motivation: 性少数群体因少数群体压力而面临更高的健康问题和精神障碍风险，需要开发有效的方法来检测在线讨论中的少数群体压力，以便进行早期干预和公共卫生政策制定。

Method: 使用ELECTRA、BERT、RoBERTa和BART等Transformer模型，与传统机器学习基线及图增强变体进行对比，评估零样本和少样本学习范式，在两个最大的公开Reddit语料库上进行实验。

Result: 整合图结构一致提高了Transformer-only模型的检测性能，带有关系上下文的监督微调优于零样本和少样本方法，图增强能更好地识别身份隐藏、内化污名等关键语言标记。

Conclusion: 图增强的Transformer模型通过建模社会连接和对话上下文，为检测少数群体压力提供了最可靠的方法，对数字健康干预和公共卫生政策具有重要意义。

Abstract: Individuals from sexual and gender minority groups experience
disproportionately high rates of poor health outcomes and mental disorders
compared to their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts, largely as a
consequence of minority stress as described by Meyer's (2003) model. This study
presents the first comprehensive evaluation of transformer-based architectures
for detecting minority stress in online discourse. We benchmark multiple
transformer models including ELECTRA, BERT, RoBERTa, and BART against
traditional machine learning baselines and graph-augmented variants. We further
assess zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms to assess their applicability
on underrepresented datasets. Experiments are conducted on the two largest
publicly available Reddit corpora for minority stress detection, comprising
12,645 and 5,789 posts, and are repeated over five random seeds to ensure
robustness. Our results demonstrate that integrating graph structure
consistently improves detection performance across transformer-only models and
that supervised fine-tuning with relational context outperforms zero and
few-shot approaches. Theoretical analysis reveals that modeling social
connectivity and conversational context via graph augmentation sharpens the
models' ability to identify key linguistic markers such as identity
concealment, internalized stigma, and calls for support, suggesting that
graph-enhanced transformers offer the most reliable foundation for digital
health interventions and public health policy.

Motivation: 解决传统方法需要复杂架构改造或分离训练的问题，开发更简单高效的集成化语音评估系统

Method: 使用LoRA技术对Phi-4-multimodal-instruct模型进行细调，在Speechocean762数据集上训练，仅修改LoRA层而不需全部层细调

Result: 预测分数与人工评分相关系数PCC>0.7，词误率和音素误率均<0.15，仅细调LoRA层即可达到全层细调的性能

Conclusion: LoRA基础方法能够以简单训练方法建立高效集成化语音评估系统，为英语学习者提供更可访的CAPT技术

Abstract: This study demonstrates that a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) adapted
via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can perform both Automatic Pronunciation
Assessment (APA) and Mispronunciation Detection and Diagnosis (MDD)
simultaneously. Leveraging Microsoft's Phi-4-multimodal-instruct, our
fine-tuning method eliminates the need for complex architectural changes or
separate training procedures conventionally required for these distinct tasks.
Fine-tuned on the Speechocean762 dataset, the pronunciation evaluation scores
predicted by the model exhibited a strong Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC
> 0.7) with human-assigned scores, while achieving low Word Error Rate (WER)
and Phoneme Error Rate (PER) (both < 0.15). Notably, fine-tuning only the LoRA
layers was sufficient to achieve performance levels comparable to those
achieved by fine-tuning all audio layers. This research highlights that an
integrated pronunciation assessment system can be established by adapting large
multimodal models without full fine-tuning, utilizing a significantly simpler
training methodology compared to previous joint models designed for
simultaneous APA and MDD. This efficient LoRA-based approach paves the way for
more accessible, integrated, and effective Computer-Assisted Pronunciation
Training (CAPT) technologies for English L2 learners.

Conclusion: 该方法能够提取社区隐式审查标准，揭示表面共享规范的实际执行差异，为内容审查系统提供了透明可解释的解决方案

Abstract: Effective content moderation systems require explicit classification
criteria, yet online communities like subreddits often operate with diverse,
implicit standards. This work introduces a novel approach to identify and
extract these implicit criteria from historical moderation data using an
interpretable architecture. We represent moderation criteria as score tables of
lexical expressions associated with content removal, enabling systematic
comparison across different communities. Our experiments demonstrate that these
extracted lexical patterns effectively replicate the performance of neural
moderation models while providing transparent insights into decision-making
processes. The resulting criteria matrix reveals significant variations in how
seemingly shared norms are actually enforced, uncovering previously
undocumented moderation patterns including community-specific tolerances for
language, features for topical restrictions, and underlying subcategories of
the toxic speech classification.

Abstract: Assistants on assembly tasks have a large potential to benefit humans from
everyday tasks to industrial settings. However, no testbeds support
application-oriented system evaluation in a practical setting, especially in
assembly. To foster the development, we propose a new multimodal QA dataset on
assembly activities. Our dataset, ProMQA-Assembly, consists of 391 QA pairs
that require the multimodal understanding of human-activity recordings and
their instruction manuals in an online-style manner. In the development, we
adopt a semi-automated QA annotation approach, where LLMs generate candidates
and humans verify them, as a cost-effective method, and further improve it by
integrating fine-grained action labels to diversify question types.
Furthermore, we create instruction task graphs for the target tasks of
assembling toy vehicles. These newly created task graphs are used in our
benchmarking experiment, as well as to facilitate the human verification
process in the QA annotation. Utilizing our dataset, we benchmark models,
including competitive proprietary multimodal models. Our results suggest great
room for improvement for the current models. We believe our new evaluation
dataset can contribute to the further development of procedural-activity
assistants.

Motivation: 现有LLM文本嵌入方法通常使用最终特殊token（如[EOS]）的嵌入，但这些token并未经过专门训练来捕捉整个上下文的语义，限制了其在检索和重排序任务中的能力

Method: 在对比学习前添加新的训练阶段，采用双向生成重建任务EBQ2D（基于嵌入的查询到文档）和EBD2Q（基于嵌入的文档到查询），交替锚定[EOS]嵌入并重建查询-文档对的两端

Result: 实验结果表明，额外的训练阶段显著提升了LLM在MTEB基准上的性能，在不同LLM基础模型和规模上都取得了新的最先进结果

Conclusion: 通过添加双向生成重建训练阶段，可以有效增强LLM最终token嵌入的语义表示能力，为文本嵌入任务提供更优的解决方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been explored as powerful text
embedders. Existing LLM-based text embedding approaches often leverage the
embedding of the final token, typically a reserved special token such as [EOS].
However, these tokens have not been intentionally trained to capture the
semantics of the whole context, limiting their capacity as text embeddings,
especially for retrieval and re-ranking tasks. We propose to add a new training
stage before contrastive learning to enrich the semantics of the final token
embedding. This stage employs bidirectional generative reconstruction tasks,
namely EBQ2D (Embedding-Based Query-to-Document) and EBD2Q (Embedding-Based
Document-to-Query), which interleave to anchor the [EOS] embedding and
reconstruct either side of Query-Document pairs. Experimental results
demonstrate that our additional training stage significantly improves LLM
performance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), achieving new
state-of-the-art results across different LLM base models and scales.

Conclusion: 该研究为开发更有效的心理治疗导向对话代理提供了重要的数据支撑和评估方法，有助于扩大心理健康服务的可及性。

Abstract: Psychotherapy reaches only a small fraction of individuals suffering from
mental disorders due to social stigma and the limited availability of
therapists. Large language models (LLMs), when equipped with professional
psychotherapeutic skills, offer a promising solution to expand access to mental
health services. However, the lack of psychological conversation datasets
presents significant challenges in developing effective psychotherapy-guided
conversational agents. In this paper, we construct a long-periodic dialogue
corpus for counseling based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Our curated
dataset includes multiple sessions for each counseling and incorporates
cognitive conceptualization diagrams (CCDs) to guide client simulation across
diverse scenarios. To evaluate the utility of our dataset, we train an in-depth
counseling model and present a comprehensive evaluation framework to benchmark
it against established psychological criteria for CBT-based counseling. Results
demonstrate that DiaCBT effectively enhances LLMs' ability to emulate
psychologists with CBT expertise, underscoring its potential for training more
professional counseling agents.

Conclusion: BLV损失函数使自动语音评估对不同学习者更加鲁棒，为解决ASA中的类别不平衡问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: Automated Speaking Assessment (ASA) plays a crucial role in evaluating
second-language (L2) learners proficiency. However, ASA models often suffer
from class imbalance, leading to biased predictions. To address this, we
introduce a novel objective for training ASA models, dubbed the Balancing Logit
Variation (BLV) loss, which perturbs model predictions to improve feature
representation for minority classes without modifying the dataset. Evaluations
on the ICNALE benchmark dataset show that integrating the BLV loss into a
celebrated text-based (BERT) model significantly enhances classification
accuracy and fairness, making automated speech evaluation more robust for
diverse learners.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型微调中的参数冗余、结构僵化和任务适应性有限的问题，提高参数利用效率和表示能力。

Method: 采用基于结构可学习机制的适配器微调方法，引入可微分门控函数和结构稀疏控制变量，保持主干参数冻结的同时通过结构搜索机制动态构建任务特定的高效子结构。

Result: 在多个多任务自然语言理解任务上优于主流参数高效调优技术，在准确性、压缩率以及对噪声和扰动的鲁棒性之间达到更好平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法通过自适应结构学习显著提升了模型性能，验证了其在多任务设置下的稳定性和鲁棒性，为高效微调提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the issues of parameter redundancy, rigid structure, and
limited task adaptability in the fine-tuning of large language models. It
proposes an adapter-based fine-tuning method built on a structure-learnable
mechanism. By introducing differentiable gating functions and structural
sparsity control variables, the method enables automatic optimization of
adapter insertion points, activation paths, and module combinations. This
allows the model to adjust its structure flexibly in multi-task settings to
match different task characteristics. With the backbone parameters kept frozen,
the method uses a structure search mechanism to guide the dynamic construction
of task-specific efficient substructures during training. This significantly
improves parameter utilization and representational capacity. In addition, the
paper designs a set of sensitivity analysis experiments to systematically
evaluate the effects of sparsity weight, noise injection ratio, and data
perturbation on model performance. These experiments verify the stability and
robustness of the proposed method across various multi-task natural language
understanding tasks. The experimental results show that the proposed method
outperforms mainstream parameter-efficient tuning techniques on multiple tasks.
It achieves a better balance among accuracy, compression rate, and robustness
to noise and perturbation.

Motivation: 商业情感分析是NLP的重要领域，需要更有效的模型来分析用户评论，帮助企业评估营销策略

Method: 使用长短期记忆网络(LSTM)替代传统RNN，解决渐消梯度问题，采用产品评论数据集，70%训练数据，30%测试数据

Result: 修改的RNN模型达到91.33%的准确率，性能显著优于其他传统RNN模型

Conclusion: LSTM模型在商业情感分析中表现优异，可以帮助企业根据客户评论调整营销策略

Abstract: Business sentiment analysis (BSA) is one of the significant and popular
topics of natural language processing. It is one kind of sentiment analysis
techniques for business purposes. Different categories of sentiment analysis
techniques like lexicon-based techniques and different types of machine
learning algorithms are applied for sentiment analysis on different languages
like English, Hindi, Spanish, etc. In this paper, long short-term memory (LSTM)
is applied for business sentiment analysis, where a recurrent neural network is
used. An LSTM model is used in a modified approach to prevent the vanishing
gradient problem rather than applying the conventional recurrent neural network
(RNN). To apply the modified RNN model, product review dataset is used. In this
experiment, 70\% of the data is trained for the LSTM and the rest 30\% of the
data is used for testing. The result of this modified RNN model is compared
with other conventional RNN models, and a comparison is made among the results.
It is noted that the proposed model performs better than the other conventional
RNN models. Here, the proposed model, i.e., the modified RNN model approach has
achieved around 91.33\% of accuracy. By applying this model, any business
company or e-commerce business site can identify the feedback from their
customers about different types of products that customers like or dislike.
Based on the customer reviews, a business company or e-commerce platform can
evaluate its marketing strategy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言中的复杂性、情感性等标量结构具有连续语义特征，但LLM对数值输出的特殊处理方式需要系统评估，以为社会科学研究者提供最佳应用方案

Method: 使用政治科学文献中的多个数据集，评估了四种方法：未加权直接点评分、成对比较聚合、token概率加权点评分和微调

Result: 直接提示LLM生成点评分会产生不连续分布；成对比较能改善质量；token概率加权点评分效果更好；仅用1000个训练对微调小模型即可匹配或超越提示LLM性能

Conclusion: 推荐使用token概率加权点评分方法，对于资源有限的研究者，微调小模型是高效可行的替代方案

Abstract: Many constructs that characterize language, like its complexity or
emotionality, have a naturally continuous semantic structure; a public speech
is not just "simple" or "complex," but exists on a continuum between extremes.
Although large language models (LLMs) are an attractive tool for measuring
scalar constructs, their idiosyncratic treatment of numerical outputs raises
questions of how to best apply them. We address these questions with a
comprehensive evaluation of LLM-based approaches to scalar construct
measurement in social science. Using multiple datasets sourced from the
political science literature, we evaluate four approaches: unweighted direct
pointwise scoring, aggregation of pairwise comparisons,
token-probability-weighted pointwise scoring, and finetuning. Our study yields
actionable findings for applied researchers. First, LLMs prompted to generate
pointwise scores directly from texts produce discontinuous distributions with
bunching at arbitrary numbers. The quality of the measurements improves with
pairwise comparisons made by LLMs, but it improves even more by taking
pointwise scores and weighting them by token probability. Finally, finetuning
smaller models with as few as 1,000 training pairs can match or exceed the
performance of prompted LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于知识编辑的轻量级指纹注入方法FSFT，用于保护大语言模型的知识产权，相比传统指令调优方法具有更好的性能和持久性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型知识产权保护日益重要，传统指纹注入方法存在性能下降、计算资源需求大、持久性差等问题，需要更轻量高效的解决方案。

Method: 首次将知识编辑应用于指纹注入，使用乱码文本作为指纹，并提出指纹子空间感知微调(FSFT)方法，通过约束指纹子空间更新来减少指纹退化。

Result: FSFT在最坏情况下性能仍超过微调10%，但发现指纹注入模型难以区分指纹和相似文本，特征相似度高。

Conclusion: 知识编辑为指纹注入提供了轻量级替代方案，FSFT有效减少了指纹退化，但需要开发更鲁棒和细粒度的指纹注入方法来应对特征相似性问题。

Abstract: The intellectual property (IP) protection of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
increasingly critical. Injecting specialized fingerprints into LLMs through
instruction tuning is a common IP protection technique. However, this may
significantly degrade model performance, requires substantial computational
resources, and exhibits poor persistence under model modifications. We argue
that knowledge editing offers a lightweight alternative that is more suitable
for fingerprint injection. Accordingly, we apply knowledge editing to
fingerprint injection for the first time and demonstrate its strong capability.
Despite using scrambled text as fingerprints to prevent them from being
overwritten during fine-tuning, degradation still occurs under large-scale
fine-tuning. To address this, we propose Fingerprint Subspace-aware Fine-Tuning
(FSFT), which reduces fingerprint degradation by constraining the update of the
fingerprint subspace. The performance of FSFT exceeds fine-tuning by 10% even
in the worst-case scenario. Additionally, we observe that the
fingerprint-injected models struggle to distinguish between fingerprints and
similar texts due to the high similarity of their features. This finding
underscores the urgent need for more robust and fine-grained fingerprinting
injection methods for LLMs.

TL;DR: 本研究通过眼动追踪和命名任务，使用广义加性模型分析爱沙尼亚语词汇处理，比较了判别式词典模型(DLM)与传统预测因子(词频、邻域大小等)的预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索计算模型(DLM)生成的词汇处理测量是否能够预测眼动和命名反应变量，并与传统预测因子进行比较，以了解词汇处理中形式和意义映射的作用。

Method: 采用大规模单被试实验，结合词汇命名任务和眼动追踪技术，分析五个反应变量(首次注视时长、总注视时长、注视次数、命名潜伏期、口语时长)，使用广义加性模型进行统计分析。

Result: DLM测量是词汇处理的有力预测因子；深度学习DLM不一定比线性映射DLM更精确；传统预测因子通常比DLM预测更精确(总注视时长除外)；命名任务中词汇变量对首次注视时长和总注视次数无预测性。

Conclusion: DLM基于形式到意义的映射，其对总注视时长、命名潜伏期和口语时长的预测性表明，在当前词汇命名任务中意义处理起着重要作用。

Abstract: This study investigates lexical processing in Estonian. A large-scale
single-subject experiment is reported that combines the word naming task with
eye-tracking. Five response variables (first fixation duration, total fixation
duration, number of fixations, word naming latency, and spoken word duration)
are analyzed with the generalized additive model. Of central interest is the
question of whether measures for lexical processing generated by a
computational model of the mental lexicon (the Discriminative Lexicon Model,
DLM) are predictive for these response variables, and how they compare to
classical predictors such as word frequency, neighborhood size, and
inflectional paradigm size. Computational models were implemented both with
linear and deep mappings. Central findings are, first, that DLM-based measures
are powerful predictors for lexical processing, second, that DLM-measures using
deep learning are not necessarily more precise predictors of lexical processing
than DLM-measures using linear mappings, third, that classical predictors tend
to provide somewhat more precise fits compared to DLM-based predictors (except
for total fixation duration, where the two provide equivalent goodness of fit),
and fourth, that in the naming task lexical variables are not predictive for
first fixation duration and the total number of fixations. As the DLM works
with mappings from form to meaning, the predictivity of DLM-based measures for
total fixation duration, naming latencies, and spoken word duration indicates
that meaning is heavily involved in the present word naming task.

Abstract: The Romansh language, spoken in Switzerland, has limited resources for
machine translation evaluation. In this paper, we present a benchmark for six
varieties of Romansh: Rumantsch Grischun, a supra-regional variety, and five
regional varieties: Sursilvan, Sutsilvan, Surmiran, Puter, and Vallader. Our
reference translations were created by human translators based on the WMT24++
benchmark, which ensures parallelism with more than 55 other languages. An
automatic evaluation of existing MT systems and LLMs shows that translation out
of Romansh into German is handled relatively well for all the varieties, but
translation into Romansh is still challenging.

Motivation: 当前流程挖掘领域主要依赖提示工程或将事件日志转换为叙事风格数据集来利用LLMs的语义能力，但忽略了LLMs在生成token序列方面的天然优势，这与流程挖掘的目标相似。

Method: 采用参数高效微调技术直接适配预训练LLMs处理流程数据，避免自然语言重构，在预测性流程监控任务上进行单任务和多任务预测实验。

Result: 在多任务设置下，微调模型在预测性能上优于最先进的RNN方法和近期基于叙事风格的解决方案，同时表现出更快的收敛速度和显著减少的超参数优化需求。

Conclusion: 直接微调预训练LLMs处理流程数据是可行的，参数高效微调技术能有效降低计算开销，在预测性流程监控任务中展现出优越性能，特别是在多任务场景下。

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a prominent
area of interest across various research domains, including Process Mining
(PM). Current applications in PM have predominantly centered on prompt
engineering strategies or the transformation of event logs into narrative-style
datasets, thereby exploiting the semantic capabilities of LLMs to address
diverse tasks. In contrast, this study investigates the direct adaptation of
pretrained LLMs to process data without natural language reformulation,
motivated by the fact that these models excel in generating sequences of
tokens, similar to the objective in PM. More specifically, we focus on
parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques to mitigate the computational
overhead typically associated with such models. Our experimental setup focuses
on Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM), and considers both single- and
multi-task predictions. The results demonstrate a potential improvement in
predictive performance over state-of-the-art recurrent neural network (RNN)
approaches and recent narrative-style-based solutions, particularly in the
multi-task setting. Additionally, our fine-tuned models exhibit faster
convergence and require significantly less hyperparameter optimization.

Result: 在26个大语言模型评测中，Claude 3.5 sonnet和GPT-4o表现最佳，平均准确率分别为67%和62%，但整体模型表现有限，特别是在人文科学等文化丰富领域表现差强

Conclusion: 大语言模型在低资源语言和文化特定内容上仍有很大改进空间，需要更好地适应不同文化背景和语言环境

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive general knowledge and
reasoning abilities, yet their evaluation has predominantly focused on global
or anglocentric subjects, often neglecting low-resource languages and
culturally specific content. While recent multilingual benchmarks attempt to
bridge this gap, many rely on automatic translation, which can introduce errors
and misrepresent the original cultural context. To address this, we introduce
SinhalaMMLU, the first multiple-choice question answering benchmark designed
specifically for Sinhala, a low-resource language. The dataset includes over
7,000 questions spanning secondary to collegiate education levels, aligned with
the Sri Lankan national curriculum, and covers six domains and 30 subjects,
encompassing both general academic topics and culturally grounded knowledge. We
evaluate 26 LLMs on SinhalaMMLU and observe that, while Claude 3.5 sonnet and
GPT-4o achieve the highest average accuracies at 67% and 62% respectively,
overall model performance remains limited. In particular, models struggle in
culturally rich domains such as the Humanities, revealing substantial room for
improvement in adapting LLMs to low-resource and culturally specific contexts.

TL;DR: AgenTracer是一个自动化框架，通过反事实重放和程序化故障注入来标注多智能体系统失败轨迹，并训练出轻量级故障追踪模型AgenTracer-8B，在智能体故障归因任务上显著优于大型专有LLM。


<details>

Motivation: LLM-based多智能体系统虽然性能优越但脆弱性高，当前最先进的推理LLM在智能体系统故障归因任务上准确率低于10%，需要专门解决方案。

Method: 提出AgenTracer框架：1）通过反事实重放和程序化故障注入自动标注失败轨迹，构建TracerTraj数据集；2）使用多粒度强化学习训练轻量级故障追踪模型AgenTracer-8B。

Result: 在Who&When基准测试中，AgenTracer-8B比Gemini-2.5-Pro和Claude-4-Sonnet等大型专有LLM性能提升高达18.18%；对MetaGPT和MaAS等多智能体系统提供可操作反馈，带来4.8-14.2%的性能提升。

Conclusion: AgenTracer-8B为多智能体系统故障归因设立了新标准，能够赋能自校正和自进化的智能体AI系统。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems, often comprising multiple
models, complex tool invocations, and orchestration protocols, substantially
outperform monolithic agents. Yet this very sophistication amplifies their
fragility, making them more prone to system failure. Pinpointing the specific
agent or step responsible for an error within long execution traces defines the
task of agentic system failure attribution. Current state-of-the-art reasoning
LLMs, however, remain strikingly inadequate for this challenge, with accuracy
generally below 10%. To address this gap, we propose AgenTracer, the first
automated framework for annotating failed multi-agent trajectories via
counterfactual replay and programmed fault injection, producing the curated
dataset TracerTraj. Leveraging this resource, we develop AgenTracer-8B, a
lightweight failure tracer trained with multi-granular reinforcement learning,
capable of efficiently diagnosing errors in verbose multi-agent interactions.
On the Who&When benchmark, AgenTracer-8B outperforms giant proprietary LLMs
like Gemini-2.5-Pro and Claude-4-Sonnet by up to 18.18%, setting a new standard
in LLM agentic failure attribution. More importantly, AgenTracer-8B delivers
actionable feedback to off-the-shelf multi-agent systems like MetaGPT and MaAS
with 4.8-14.2% performance gains, empowering self-correcting and self-evolving
agentic AI.

Result: 事实频率是知识获取的关键因素，但不能完全解释学习趋势；模型在知识基准测试中与流行开源模型性能相当

Conclusion: LMEnt为研究语言模型中的知识表示、可塑性、编辑、归因和学习动态提供了有价值的资源和支持

Abstract: Language models (LMs) increasingly drive real-world applications that require
world knowledge. However, the internal processes through which models turn data
into representations of knowledge and beliefs about the world, are poorly
understood. Insights into these processes could pave the way for developing LMs
with knowledge representations that are more consistent, robust, and complete.
To facilitate studying these questions, we present LMEnt, a suite for analyzing
knowledge acquisition in LMs during pretraining. LMEnt introduces: (1) a
knowledge-rich pretraining corpus, fully annotated with entity mentions, based
on Wikipedia, (2) an entity-based retrieval method over pretraining data that
outperforms previous approaches by as much as 80.4%, and (3) 12 pretrained
models with up to 1B parameters and 4K intermediate checkpoints, with
comparable performance to popular open-sourced models on knowledge benchmarks.
Together, these resources provide a controlled environment for analyzing
connections between entity mentions in pretraining and downstream performance,
and the effects of causal interventions in pretraining data. We show the
utility of LMEnt by studying knowledge acquisition across checkpoints, finding
that fact frequency is key, but does not fully explain learning trends. We
release LMEnt to support studies of knowledge in LMs, including knowledge
representations, plasticity, editing, attribution, and learning dynamics.

Method: 使用BERT-6架构在Wikipedia数据集上进行预训练，然后在FewRel和DBpedia分类任务上进行微调，通过token准确率(APT)和token混淆矩阵分析预训练机制。

Conclusion: 预训练通过对称性破缺形成token簇来构建高阶语言结构，这种机制具有普适性，能显著提升下游任务的微调性能。

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) enables the understanding and generation of
meaningful human language, typically using a pre-trained complex architecture
on a large dataset to learn the language and next fine-tune its weights to
implement a specific task. Twofold goals are examined; to understand the
mechanism underlying successful pre-training and to determine the interplay
between the pre-training accuracy and the fine-tuning of classification tasks.
The following main results were obtained; the accuracy per token (APT)
increased with its appearance frequency in the dataset, and its average over
all tokens served as an order parameter to quantify pre-training success, which
increased along the transformer blocks. Pre-training broke the symmetry among
tokens and grouped them into finite, small, strong match token clusters, as
inferred from the presented token confusion matrix. This feature was sharpened
along the transformer blocks toward the output layer, enhancing its performance
considerably compared with that of the embedding layer. Consequently,
higher-order language structures were generated by pre-training, even though
the learning cost function was directed solely at identifying a single token.
These pre-training findings were reflected by the improved fine-tuning accuracy
along the transformer blocks. Additionally, the output label prediction
confidence was found to be independent of the average input APT, as the input
meaning was preserved since the tokens are replaced primarily by strong match
tokens. Finally, although pre-training is commonly absent in image
classification tasks, its underlying mechanism is similar to that used in
fine-tuning NLP classification tasks, hinting at its universality. The results
were based on the BERT-6 architecture pre-trained on the Wikipedia dataset and

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了ComplexEval评测基准，系统性地揭示了大语言模型作为评判者时的辅助信息偏差问题，发现所有模型都存在显著偏差，且偏差程度随任务复杂性增加而加剧


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型能力提升，面对越来越复杂的任务，可靠的评估变得其具挑战。虽然LLMs作为评判者的方式成为可扩展解决方案，但之前研究主要集中在简单场景，在复杂任务中的可靠性仍然不足

Method: 构建ComplexEval挑战性评测基准，系统性地揭示和量化辅助信息引发的偏差。在12个基础场景和3个高级场景中调查和验证了6种之前未经探索的偏差

Result: 关键发现：(1)所有评估模型都显示出对这些偏差的显著敏感性，偏差程度随任务复杂性增加而加剧；(2)特别是，大型推理模型(LRMs)显示出矛盾的弱点

Conclusion: 深入分析为提高评估信号的准确性和可验证性提供了关键见解，为开发更通用和稳健的评估模型掘平了道路

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow more capable, they face increasingly
diverse and complex tasks, making reliable evaluation challenging. The paradigm
of LLMs as judges has emerged as a scalable solution, yet prior work primarily
focuses on simple settings. Their reliability in complex tasks--where
multi-faceted rubrics, unstructured reference answers, and nuanced criteria are
critical--remains understudied. In this paper, we constructed ComplexEval, a
challenge benchmark designed to systematically expose and quantify Auxiliary
Information Induced Biases. We systematically investigated and validated 6
previously unexplored biases across 12 basic and 3 advanced scenarios. Key
findings reveal: (1) all evaluated models exhibit significant susceptibility to
these biases, with bias magnitude scaling with task complexity; (2) notably,
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) show paradoxical vulnerability. Our in-depth
analysis offers crucial insights for improving the accuracy and verifiability
of evaluation signals, paving the way for more general and robust evaluation
models.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了第一个连续沙特手语语料集KAU-CSSL和一种基于Transformer的模型，专门用于阿拉伯手语识别，解决了阿拉伯手语资源缺乏的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 沙特手语(SSL)作为过蓄84,000人的主要沟通方式，但现有技术主要集中在非阿拉伯手语，导致阿拉伯手语资源严重缺乏。阿拉伯语言的复杂性和现有数据集仅包含单词而非连续语句的问题也加剧了这一挑战。

Method: 研究人员创建了第一个连续沙特手语数据集KAU-CSSL，重点关注完整句子。同时提出了一种基于Transformer的模型，利用预训练的ResNet-18进行空间特征提取，以及使用双向LSTM的Transformer Encoder来处理时序依赖关系。

Result: 模型在指定使用者模式下达到了99.02%的准确率，在非指定使用者模式下也获得77.71%的准确率。

Conclusion: 这项研究为沙特手语社区提供了重要的资源，不仅有助于改善沟通工具，还对手语识别领域做出了重要贡献，为阿拉伯手语的进一步研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Sign language (SL) is an essential communication form for hearing-impaired
and deaf people, enabling engagement within the broader society. Despite its
significance, limited public awareness of SL often leads to inequitable access
to educational and professional opportunities, thereby contributing to social
exclusion, particularly in Saudi Arabia, where over 84,000 individuals depend
on Saudi Sign Language (SSL) as their primary form of communication. Although
certain technological approaches have helped to improve communication for
individuals with hearing impairments, there continues to be an urgent
requirement for more precise and dependable translation techniques, especially
for Arabic sign language variants like SSL. Most state-of-the-art solutions
have primarily focused on non-Arabic sign languages, resulting in a
considerable absence of resources dedicated to Arabic sign language,
specifically SSL. The complexity of the Arabic language and the prevalence of
isolated sign language datasets that concentrate on individual words instead of
continuous speech contribute to this issue. To address this gap, our research
represents an important step in developing SSL resources. To address this, we
introduce the first continuous Saudi Sign Language dataset called KAU-CSSL,
focusing on complete sentences to facilitate further research and enable
sophisticated recognition systems for SSL recognition and translation.
Additionally, we propose a transformer-based model, utilizing a pretrained
ResNet-18 for spatial feature extraction and a Transformer Encoder with
Bidirectional LSTM for temporal dependencies, achieving 99.02\% accuracy at
signer dependent mode and 77.71\% accuracy at signer independent mode. This
development leads the way to not only improving communication tools for the SSL
community but also making a substantial contribution to the wider field of sign
language.

deep reinforcement learning method to facilitate conversion from state value to
optimal policy.The enhanced agent works better in several text-based game
experiments and significantlysurpasses previous agents on game completion ratio

TL;DR: 通过长期低活动性神经元来实现更强的正则化，采用状态记忆机制避免神经元复活时的训练不稳定性，提升了模型的沿升性能和稳健性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统正则化方法如Dropout只是临时急活神经元，本文探索长期低活动性的更强正则化效果，但这种方法引发了神经元复活时的严重训练不稳定性问题。

Method: 提出生命周期(LC)原则，核心是状态记忆机制。当神经元被复活时，不是重新初始化权重，而是恢复到最后一次有效状态，保留已学习知识并避免破坏性的优化冲击。

Result: 理论分析显示L原则能够平滑损失地形，导向更平坦的最小值。图像分类实验证明方法能够提升模型的沿升性能和稳健性。分离实验确认状态记忆机制对性能提升至关重要。

Conclusion: 生命周期原则通过状态记忆机制有效解决了长期低活性神经元复活时的训练不稳定性问题，为深度学习模型提供了一种更有效的正则化方法，能够在保持学习知识的同时提升模型的沿升性能。

Abstract: I investigate a stronger form of regularization by deactivating neurons for
extended periods, a departure from the temporary changes of methods like
Dropout. However, this long-term dynamism introduces a critical challenge:
severe training instability when neurons are revived with random weights. To
solve this, I propose the Lifecycle (LC) principle, a regularization mechanism
centered on a key innovation: state memory. Instead of re-initializing a
revived neuron, my method restores its parameters to their last known effective
state. This process preserves learned knowledge and avoids destructive
optimization shocks. My theoretical analysis reveals that the LC principle
smooths the loss landscape, guiding optimization towards flatter minima
associated with better generalization. Experiments on image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that my method improves generalization and robustness.
Crucially, ablation studies confirm that state memory is essential for
achieving these gains.

Abstract: Protecting endangered wildlife from illegal poaching presents a critical
challenge, particularly in vast and partially observable environments where
real-time response is essential. This paper introduces a novel
Expectation-Maximization (EM) based latent variable modeling approach in the
context of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV) coordination in wildlife protection. By modeling hidden
environmental factors and inter-agent dynamics through latent variables, our
method enhances exploration and coordination under uncertainty.We implement and
evaluate our EM-MARL framework using a custom simulation involving 10 UAVs
tasked with patrolling protected habitats of the endangered Iranian leopard.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate superior performance in detection
accuracy, adaptability, and policy convergence when compared to standard
algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Deterministic
Policy Gradient (DDPG). Our findings underscore the potential of combining EM
inference with MARL to improve decentralized decisionmaking in complex,
high-stakes conservation scenarios. The full implementation, simulation
environment, and training scripts are publicly available on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 类别不平衡是机器学习中的基本挑战，传统解决方案往往带来新问题。研究者发现群体感知阈值校准可以提供比合成数据生成方法更好的鲁棒性

Method: 采用群体感知阈值校准方法，为不同人口统计群体设置不同的决策阈值，而不是对所有群体使用单一阈值

Result: 实验显示群体特定阈值比SMOTE和CT-GAN增强模型获得1.5-4%更高的平衡准确率，同时改善了最差群体平衡准确率。该方法在平衡准确率和最差群体平衡准确率之间优化了帕累托前沿

Conclusion: 群体感知阈值校准提供了一个更简单、更可解释且更有效的类别不平衡解决方案，相比合成数据增强方法具有明显优势

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning, with
traditional solutions often creating as many problems as they solve. We
demonstrate that group-aware threshold calibration--setting different decision
thresholds for different demographic groups--provides superior robustness
compared to synthetic data generation methods. Through extensive experiments,
we show that group-specific thresholds achieve 1.5-4% higher balanced accuracy
than SMOTE and CT-GAN augmented models while improving worst-group balanced
accuracy. Unlike single-threshold approaches that apply one cutoff across all
groups, our group-aware method optimizes the Pareto frontier between balanced
accuracy and worst-group balanced accuracy, enabling fine-grained control over
group-level performance. Critically, we find that applying group thresholds to
synthetically augmented data yields minimal additional benefit, suggesting
these approaches are fundamentally redundant. Our results span seven model
families including linear, tree-based, instance-based, and boosting methods,
confirming that group-aware threshold calibration offers a simpler, more
interpretable, and more effective solution to class imbalance.

Motivation: 睡眠分期模型在面对未见过的患者生理特征或记录条件时性能会下降，需要一种无需源数据或患者校准的实用自适应方法。

Method: 结合熵最小化(Tent)、批归一化统计刷新，并添加两个安全机制：熵门控(在不确定窗口暂停适应)和EMA重置(防止漂移)的流式测试时自适应方法。

Result: 在Sleep-EDF Expanded数据集上，使用单导联EEG，相比冻结基线模型在秒级延迟和最小内存消耗下获得一致性能提升，报告了各阶段指标和Cohen's k值。

Conclusion: 该方法模型无关、无需源数据或患者校准，适用于设备端或床旁使用，具有实用价值。

Abstract: Sleep staging models often degrade when deployed on patients with unseen
physiology or recording conditions. We propose a streaming, source-free
test-time adaptation (TTA) recipe that combines entropy minimization (Tent)
with Batch-Norm statistic refresh and two safety rails: an entropy gate to
pause adaptation on uncertain windows and an EMA-based reset to reel back
drift. On Sleep-EDF Expanded, using single-lead EEG (Fpz-Cz, 100 Hz, 30s
epochs; R&K to AASM mapping), we show consistent gains over a frozen baseline
at seconds-level latency and minimal memory, reporting per-stage metrics and
Cohen's k. The method is model-agnostic, requires no source data or patient
calibration, and is practical for on-device or bedside use.

Motivation: 公共卫生领域的序列资源分配问题具有复杂模糊的目标和有限的数据可用性，这为对齐技术提供了具有挑战性的测试平台，需要开发能够处理偏好分布不确定性的鲁棒方法。

Result: 在ARMMAN组织的真实世界孕产妇移动健康项目和标准对齐基准测试中，DPO-PRO相比现有DPO变体在噪声偏好信号下表现出更好的鲁棒性，且与基于自反思的基线方法性能相当但推理成本显著降低。

Conclusion: DPO-PRO是一种有效的鲁棒微调算法，能够在复杂公共卫生场景中设计奖励函数，同时保持较低的计算成本。

Abstract: We study an LLM fine-tuning task for designing reward functions for
sequential resource allocation problems in public health, guided by human
preferences expressed in natural language. This setting presents a challenging
testbed for alignment due to complex and ambiguous objectives and limited data
availability. We propose DPO-PRO, a robust fine-tuning algorithm based on
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which accounts for uncertainty in the
preference distribution using a lightweight Distributionally Robust
Optimization (DRO) formulation. Unlike prior DRO-based DPO methods, DPO-PRO is
significantly less conservative. We evaluate DPO-PRO on a real-world maternal
mobile health program operated by the non-profit organization ARMMAN, as well
as on standard alignment benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method consistently improves robustness to noisy preference signals compared to
existing DPO variants. Moreover, DPO-PRO achieves comparable performance to
prior self-reflection-based baseline for reward function design, while
requiring significantly lower inference-time cost.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Policy gradient (PG) methods in reinforcement learning frequently utilize
deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn a shared backbone of feature
representations used to compute likelihoods in an action selection layer.
Numerous studies have been conducted on the convergence and global optima of
policy networks, but few have analyzed representational structures of those
underlying networks. While training an optimal policy DNN, we observed that
under certain constraints, a gentle structure resembling neural collapse, which
we refer to as Action Collapse (AC), emerges. This suggests that 1) the
state-action activations (i.e. last-layer features) sharing the same optimal
actions collapse towards those optimal actions respective mean activations; 2)
the variability of activations sharing the same optimal actions converges to
zero; 3) the weights of action selection layer and the mean activations
collapse to a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF). Our early work showed
those aforementioned constraints to be necessary for these observations. Since
the collapsed ETF of optimal policy DNNs maximally separates the pair-wise
angles of all actions in the state-action space, we naturally raise a question:
can we learn an optimal policy using an ETF structure as a (fixed) target
configuration in the action selection layer? Our analytical proof shows that
learning activations with a fixed ETF as action selection layer naturally leads
to the AC. We thus propose the Action Collapse Policy Gradient (ACPG) method,
which accordingly affixes a synthetic ETF as our action selection layer. ACPG
induces the policy DNN to produce such an ideal configuration in the action
selection layer while remaining optimal. Our experiments across various OpenAI
Gym environments demonstrate that our technique can be integrated into any
discrete PG methods and lead to favorable reward improvements more quickly and
robustly.

Motivation: 现有深度学习测试方法主要关注特定失败诱导特征，但忽略了特征空间中其他区域的失败模式。需要一种能够全面映射输入特征空间并识别不同失败特征组的方法。

Method: 使用降维技术获得输入嵌入表示，然后进行聚类分析。通过深度神经网络自动评估不同嵌入和聚类配置，选择最优的拓扑图配置。

Result: TopoMap生成的拓扑图包含可区分且有意义的区域。在变异分析中，相比随机选择，对可杀死变异体的效果提升35%，对不可杀死变异体的效果提升61%。

Conclusion: TopoMap提供了一种有效的方法来映射深度学习模型的输入特征空间，能够识别和分组不同的失败模式，为深度学习测试提供了新的工具和视角。

Abstract: Testing Deep Learning (DL)-based systems is an open challenge. Although it is
relatively easy to find inputs that cause a DL model to misbehave, the grouping
of inputs by features that make the DL model under test fail is largely
unexplored. Existing approaches for DL testing introduce perturbations that may
focus on specific failure-inducing features, while neglecting others that
belong to different regions of the feature space. In this paper, we create an
explicit topographical map of the input feature space. Our approach, named
TopoMap, is both black-box and model-agnostic as it relies solely on features
that characterise the input space. To discriminate the inputs according to the
specific features they share, we first apply dimensionality reduction to obtain
input embeddings, which are then subjected to clustering. Each DL model might
require specific embedding computations and clustering algorithms to achieve a
meaningful separation of inputs into discriminative groups. We propose a novel
way to evaluate alternative configurations of embedding and clustering
techniques. We used a deep neural network (DNN) as an approximation of a human
evaluator who could tell whether a pair of clusters can be discriminated based
on the features of the included elements. We use such a DNN to automatically
select the optimal topographical map of the inputs among all those that are
produced by different embedding/clustering configurations. The evaluation
results show that the maps generated by TopoMap consist of distinguishable and
meaningful regions. In addition, we evaluate the effectiveness of TopoMap using
mutation analysis. In particular, we assess whether the clusters in our
topographical map allow for an effective selection of mutation-killing inputs.
Experimental results show that our approach outperforms random selection by 35%
on average on killable mutants; by 61% on non-killable ones.

Abstract: This work explores the potential of foundation models, specifically a
Mamba-based selective state space model, for enhancing EEG analysis in
neurological disorder diagnosis. EEG, crucial for diagnosing conditions like
epilepsy, presents significant challenges due to its noisy, high-dimensional,
and nonlinear nature. Traditional machine learning methods have made advances
in automating EEG analysis but often fail to capture its complex
spatio-temporal dynamics. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly in
sequence modeling, offer new avenues for creating more generalized and
expressive models capable of handling such complexities. By training a
Mamba-based model on a large dataset containing seizure and non-seizure EEG
recordings through a self-supervised reconstruction task followed by a seizure
detection task, we demonstrate the model's effectiveness, achieving an AUROC of
0.72 on a held-out test set. This approach marks a significant step toward
developing large-scale, clinically applicable foundation models for EEG data
analysis.

Motivation: 现有MoE模型通常每层激活固定数量的专家，导致冗余计算和次优性能。传统剪枝方法主要减少内存占用，但对GPU推理效率提升有限。

Method: LExI是一种无需数据的优化技术，仅利用模型权重估计每层相对重要性，自适应分配每层激活专家数量。

Result: 在语言和视觉MoE基准测试中，LExI显著优于传统剪枝方法，推理效率大幅提升且精度损失可忽略。例如Qwen1.5-MoE在H100 GPU上达到相同吞吐量时精度提升10%。

Conclusion: LExI通过动态调整每层专家激活数量，有效解决了MoE模型推理效率问题，为稀疏架构优化提供了新方向。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale efficiently by activating only a subset
of experts per token, offering a computationally sparse alternative to dense
architectures. While prior post-training optimizations, such as inter- and
intra-expert pruning, reduce memory usage they provide limited gains in
inference-time compute efficiency. Moreover, existing MoE architectures
typically activate a fixed number of experts uniformly across all layers,
resulting in redundant computation and suboptimal performance. In this work, we
first demonstrate that MoE pruning strategies improve only the memory footprint
but do not significantly improve inference performance on GPU using optimized
frameworks such as vLLM. To address this, we introduce LExI, a data-free
optimization technique that determines the optimal number of active experts per
layer in a pretrained MoE model. LExI leverages only the model weights to
estimate the relative importance of each layer and adaptively assigns the
number of active experts accordingly per layer. Experiments on state-of-the-art
language and vision MoE benchmarks demonstrate that LExI significantly
outperforms traditional MoE pruning approaches in terms of inference efficiency
with negligible accuracy loss. For example, using LExI, Qwen1.5-MoE achieves
the same throughput on Nvidia H100 GPU with 10% better accuracy than
traditional expert pruning.

Motivation: 为了解决从不同稀疏度、分辨率和模态的异构地球物理数据中重建地下属性的挑战，需要一种能够灵活处理多种观测类型并支持新模态扩展的统一模型架构。

Method: 采用基于Transformer的架构，结合位置编码和基于文本嵌入模型的模态编码。支持八种模态（方向角、分类类别、连续属性如温度和厚度），实现上下文学习能力，可以无输入或任意数量观测进行预测。

Result: 在验证数据上，应力角预测误差减少了超过三倍。模型具有可扩展性，参数增加时性能进一步提升。

Conclusion: Transparent Earth为地球地下属性预测提供了一个可扩展的基础模型框架，能够处理任意模态组合，最终目标是预测地球上任何地方的地下属性。

Abstract: We present the Transparent Earth, a transformer-based architecture for
reconstructing subsurface properties from heterogeneous datasets that vary in
sparsity, resolution, and modality, where each modality represents a distinct
type of observation (e.g., stress angle, mantle temperature, tectonic plate
type). The model incorporates positional encodings of observations together
with modality encodings, derived from a text embedding model applied to a
description of each modality. This design enables the model to scale to an
arbitrary number of modalities, making it straightforward to add new ones not
considered in the initial design. We currently include eight modalities
spanning directional angles, categorical classes, and continuous properties
such as temperature and thickness. These capabilities support in-context
learning, enabling the model to generate predictions either with no inputs or
with an arbitrary number of additional observations from any subset of
modalities. On validation data, this reduces errors in predicting stress angle
by more than a factor of three. The proposed architecture is scalable and
demonstrates improved performance with increased parameters. Together, these
advances make the Transparent Earth an initial foundation model for the Earth's
subsurface that ultimately aims to predict any subsurface property anywhere on
Earth.

Motivation: 现有预测不确定性方法存在局限：多假设预测缺乏理论聚合，集成学习难以捕捉结构化歧义，缺乏与损失几何一致的统一框架。

Method: 使用Bregman散度进行质心聚合，将多假设预测与集成学习联系起来，支持闭式最小二乘估计器和基于梯度的通用目标优化，提供可调多样性机制。

Conclusion: 结构化基函数网络提供了一个统一的框架，能够同时处理回归和分类问题，通过调节多样性参数来优化预测性能。

Abstract: Existing approaches to predictive uncertainty rely either on multi-hypothesis
prediction, which promotes diversity but lacks principled aggregation, or on
ensemble learning, which improves accuracy but rarely captures the structured
ambiguity. This implicitly means that a unified framework consistent with the
loss geometry remains absent. The Structured Basis Function Network addresses
this gap by linking multi-hypothesis prediction and ensembling through
centroidal aggregation induced by Bregman divergences. The formulation applies
across regression and classification by aligning predictions with the geometry
of the loss, and supports both a closed-form least-squares estimator and a
gradient-based procedure for general objectives. A tunable diversity mechanism
provides parametric control of the bias-variance-diversity trade-off,
connecting multi-hypothesis generalisation with loss-aware ensemble
aggregation. Experiments validate this relation and use the mechanism to study
the complexity-capacity-diversity trade-off across datasets of increasing
difficulty with deep-learning predictors.

Result: 实验表明，通过该框架预训练的模型在各种基于图结构的任务上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种有效的图神经网络预训练方法，通过特征向量学习来捕捉全局图结构信息，相比专注于领域特定任务的现有预训练方法更具通用性和灵活性。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by
inductively learning Laplacian eigenvectors. Traditional Message Passing Neural
Networks (MPNNs) often struggle to capture global and regional graph structure
due to over-smoothing risk as network depth increases. Because the
low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrix encode global
information, pre-training GNNs to predict these eigenvectors encourages the
network to naturally learn large-scale structural patterns over each graph.
Empirically, we show that models pre-trained via our framework outperform
baseline models on a variety of graph structure-based tasks. While most
existing pre-training methods focus on domain-specific tasks like node or edge
feature reconstruction, our self-supervised pre-training framework is
structure-based and highly flexible. Eigenvector-learning can be applied to all
graph-based datasets, and can be used with synthetic features when
task-specific data is sparse.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 利用预训练大语言模型(LLMs)改进物理信息符号回归(PiSR)，通过将LLM评估集成到损失函数中，自动融入领域知识，减少人工干预，提高方程发现的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统物理信息符号回归需要专业公式和手动特征工程，限制了非领域专家的使用。希望通过LLMs的上下文理解能力，自动化领域知识整合，使符号回归更易于应用于广泛的科学问题。

Method: 将预训练LLMs集成到符号回归的损失函数中，增加LLM对生成方程的评估项。使用三种SR算法(DEAP、gplearn、PySR)和三种LLMs(Falcon、Mistral、LLama 2)，在三种物理动力学(落球、简谐运动、电磁波)上进行评估。

Result: LLM集成显著提高了从数据中重建物理动力学的效果，增强了SR模型对噪声和复杂性的鲁棒性。更信息丰富的提示词能显著提升性能。

Conclusion: LLMs可以有效促进符号回归中的知识整合，使物理信息符号回归更加自动化和易于使用，为科学发现提供了有前景的工具。

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) has emerged as a powerful tool for automated
scientific discovery, enabling the derivation of governing equations from
experimental data. A growing body of work illustrates the promise of
integrating domain knowledge into the SR to improve the discovered equation's
generality and usefulness. Physics-informed SR (PiSR) addresses this by
incorporating domain knowledge, but current methods often require specialized
formulations and manual feature engineering, limiting their adaptability only
to domain experts. In this study, we leverage pre-trained Large Language Models
(LLMs) to facilitate knowledge integration in PiSR. By harnessing the
contextual understanding of LLMs trained on vast scientific literature, we aim
to automate the incorporation of domain knowledge, reducing the need for manual
intervention and making the process more accessible to a broader range of
scientific problems. Namely, the LLM is integrated into the SR's loss function,
adding a term of the LLM's evaluation of the SR's produced equation. We
extensively evaluate our method using three SR algorithms (DEAP, gplearn, and
PySR) and three pre-trained LLMs (Falcon, Mistral, and LLama 2) across three
physical dynamics (dropping ball, simple harmonic motion, and electromagnetic
wave). The results demonstrate that LLM integration consistently improves the
reconstruction of physical dynamics from data, enhancing the robustness of SR
models to noise and complexity. We further explore the impact of prompt
engineering, finding that more informative prompts significantly improve
performance.

Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型中冲突检测与冲突解决机制难以分离的挑战，探索如何通过机制分析来提升模型在多模态冲突场景下的鲁棒性。

Method: 对LLaVA-OV-7B模型进行机制性研究，使用线性探针监督度量和基于组的注意力模式分析来分解冲突检测和解决过程。

Result: 发现模型中间层出现可线性解码的冲突信号，冲突检测和解决的注意力模式在网络不同阶段出现分化，证实了检测与解决是功能不同的机制。

Conclusion: 这种功能分解为实现更可操作的模型解释性和针对性干预提供了基础，有助于提升模型在挑战性多模态环境中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper highlights the challenge of decomposing conflict detection from
conflict resolution in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and presents potential
approaches, including using a supervised metric via linear probes and
group-based attention pattern analysis. We conduct a mechanistic investigation
of LLaVA-OV-7B, a state-of-the-art VLM that exhibits diverse resolution
behaviors when faced with conflicting multimodal inputs. Our results show that
a linearly decodable conflict signal emerges in the model's intermediate layers
and that attention patterns associated with conflict detection and resolution
diverge at different stages of the network. These findings support the
hypothesis that detection and resolution are functionally distinct mechanisms.
We discuss how such decomposition enables more actionable interpretability and
targeted interventions for improving model robustness in challenging multimodal
settings.

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型遗忘方法在全面评估下效果不佳，需要更稳定有效的遗忘机制来确保模型安全，删除预训练中的私有数据或有害知识

Method: 使用Jensen-Shannon散度作为训练目标，同时对遗忘集和保留集进行优化，相比常用损失函数提供更稳定有效的遗忘动态

Result: JensUn在广泛实验中实现了比竞争方法更好的遗忘-效用权衡，表现出对良性重新学习的强韧性，新评估框架显示许多现有方法效果不如预期

Conclusion: JensUn提供了更有效的LLM遗忘解决方案，新的评估标准揭示了现有方法的局限性，为未来遗忘研究提供了更严格的评估基准

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) involves precisely removing
specific information from a pre-trained model. This is crucial to ensure safety
of LLMs by deleting private data or harmful knowledge acquired during
pre-training. However, existing unlearning methods often fall short when
subjected to thorough evaluation. To overcome this, we introduce JensUn, where
we leverage the Jensen-Shannon Divergence as the training objective for both
forget and retain sets for more stable and effective unlearning dynamics
compared to commonly used loss functions. In extensive experiments, JensUn
achieves better forget-utility trade-off than competing methods, and even
demonstrates strong resilience to benign relearning. Additionally, for a
precise unlearning evaluation, we introduce LKF, a curated dataset of
lesser-known facts that provides a realistic unlearning scenario. Finally, to
comprehensively test unlearning methods, we propose (i) employing an LLM as
semantic judge instead of the standard ROUGE score, and (ii) using worst-case
unlearning evaluation over various paraphrases and input formats. Our improved
evaluation framework reveals that many existing methods are less effective than
previously thought.

Motivation: 肥胖是全球急需解决的健康问题，机器学习在早期风险预测中显示了潜力，但对集成技术（特别是混合多数投票咉集成堆叠）的比较评估仍有限。本研究旨在填补这一空白，为医疗健康应用提供更好的预测模型选择指南。

Method: 使用两个数据集评估三种集成模型：多数硬投票、权重硬投票咉堆叠（以多层感知机为元分类器）。分析了9种机器学习算法的50个超参数配置，选择前三名模型作为基学习器。预处理步骤包括数据集平衡咉异常值检测，使用准确率咉F1分数评估模型性能。

Conclusion: 结果证实集成堆叠方法具有更强的预测能力，特别适用于复杂的数据分布情况。混合多数投票仍然是一个稳健的备选方案，为医疗健康预测模型的选择提供了有价值的导向。

Abstract: Obesity is a critical global health issue driven by dietary, physiological,
and environmental factors, and is strongly associated with chronic diseases
such as diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and cancer. Machine learning has
emerged as a promising approach for early obesity risk prediction, yet a
comparative evaluation of ensemble techniques -- particularly hybrid majority
voting and ensemble stacking -- remains limited. This study aims to compare
hybrid majority voting and ensemble stacking methods for obesity risk
prediction, identifying which approach delivers higher accuracy and efficiency.
The analysis seeks to highlight the complementary strengths of these ensemble
techniques in guiding better predictive model selection for healthcare
applications. Two datasets were utilized to evaluate three ensemble models:
Majority Hard Voting, Weighted Hard Voting, and Stacking (with a Multi-Layer
Perceptron as meta-classifier). A pool of nine Machine Learning (ML)
algorithms, evaluated across a total of 50 hyperparameter configurations, was
analyzed to identify the top three models to serve as base learners for the
ensemble methods. Preprocessing steps involved dataset balancing, and outlier
detection, and model performance was evaluated using Accuracy and F1-Score. On
Dataset-1, weighted hard voting and stacking achieved nearly identical
performance (Accuracy: 0.920304, F1: 0.920070), outperforming majority hard
voting. On Dataset-2, stacking demonstrated superior results (Accuracy:
0.989837, F1: 0.989825) compared to majority hard voting (Accuracy: 0.981707,
F1: 0.981675) and weighted hard voting, which showed the lowest performance.
The findings confirm that ensemble stacking provides stronger predictive
capability, particularly for complex data distributions, while hybrid majority
voting remains a robust alternative.

Abstract: Conformal prediction has been explored as a general and efficient way to
provide uncertainty quantification for time series. However, current methods
struggle to handle time series data with change points - sudden shifts in the
underlying data-generating process. In this paper, we propose a novel Conformal
Prediction for Time-series with Change points (CPTC) algorithm, addressing this
gap by integrating a model to predict the underlying state with online
conformal prediction to model uncertainties in non-stationary time series. We
prove CPTC's validity and improved adaptivity in the time series setting under
minimum assumptions, and demonstrate CPTC's practical effectiveness on 6
synthetic and real-world datasets, showing improved validity and adaptivity
compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: TTC框架为PDE建模中更先进的推理算法奠定了基础，包括构建基于强化学习的方法，有望改变物理和工程领域的计算工作流程

Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are the bedrock for modern
computational sciences and engineering, and inherently computationally
expensive. While PDE foundation models have shown much promise for simulating
such complex spatio-temporal phenomena, existing models remain constrained by
the pretraining datasets and struggle with auto-regressive rollout performance,
especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. Furthermore, they have
significant compute and training data requirements which hamper their use in
many critical applications. Inspired by recent advances in ``thinking"
strategies used in large language models (LLMs), we introduce the first
test-time computing (TTC) strategy for PDEs that utilizes computational
resources during inference to achieve more accurate predictions with fewer
training samples and smaller models. We accomplish this with two types of
reward models that evaluate predictions of a stochastic based model for
spatio-temporal consistency. We demonstrate this method on compressible
Euler-equation simulations from the PDEGym benchmark and show that TTC captures
improved predictions relative to standard non-adaptive auto-regressive
inference. This TTC framework marks a foundational step towards more advanced
reasoning algorithms or PDE modeling, inluding building
reinforcement-learning-based approaches, potentially transforming computational
workflows in physics and engineering.

Result: 在Grid2Op仿真环境中表现优于标准基线方法，计算效率显著高于基于仿真的专家方法

Conclusion: 该方法通过分解观测空间和使用GNN处理局部信息，实现了有效的分布式电网控制，为大规模电网管理提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: The necessary integration of renewable energy sources, combined with the
expanding scale of power networks, presents significant challenges in
controlling modern power grids. Traditional control systems, which are human
and optimization-based, struggle to adapt and to scale in such an evolving
context, motivating the exploration of more dynamic and distributed control
strategies. This work advances a graph-based distributed reinforcement learning
framework for real-time, scalable grid management. The proposed architecture
consists of a network of distributed low-level agents acting on individual
power lines and coordinated by a high-level manager agent. A Graph Neural
Network (GNN) is employed to encode the network's topological information
within the single low-level agent's observation. To accelerate convergence and
enhance learning stability, the framework integrates imitation learning and
potential-based reward shaping. In contrast to conventional decentralized
approaches that decompose only the action space while relying on global
observations, this method also decomposes the observation space. Each low-level
agent acts based on a structured and informative local view of the environment
constructed through the GNN. Experiments on the Grid2Op simulation environment
show the effectiveness of the approach, which consistently outperforms the
standard baseline commonly adopted in the field. Additionally, the proposed
model proves to be much more computationally efficient than the
simulation-based Expert method.

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a critical challenge in machine learning (ML),
particularly in the medical domain, where underrepresented minority classes
lead to biased models and reduced predictive performance. This study introduces
Quantum-Inspired SMOTE (QI-SMOTE), a novel data augmentation technique that
enhances the performance of ML classifiers, including Random Forest (RF),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbors
(KNN), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Neural Networks, by leveraging quantum
principles such as quantum evolution and layered entanglement. Unlike
conventional oversampling methods, QI-SMOTE generates synthetic instances that
preserve complex data structures, improving model generalization and
classification accuracy. We validate QI-SMOTE on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV
datasets, using mortality detection as a benchmark task due to their clinical
significance and inherent class imbalance. We compare our method against
traditional oversampling techniques, including Borderline-SMOTE, ADASYN,
SMOTE-ENN, SMOTE-TOMEK, and SVM-SMOTE, using key performance metrics such as
Accuracy, F1-score, G-Mean, and AUC-ROC. The results demonstrate that QI-SMOTE
significantly improves the effectiveness of ensemble methods (RF, GB, ADA),
kernel-based models (SVM), and deep learning approaches by producing more
informative and balanced training data. By integrating quantum-inspired
transformations into the ML pipeline, QI-SMOTE not only mitigates class
imbalance but also enhances the robustness and reliability of predictive models
in medical diagnostics and decision-making. This study highlights the potential
of quantum-inspired resampling techniques in advancing state-of-the-art ML
methodologies.

Abstract: Generating synthetic datasets that accurately reflect real-world
observational data is critical for evaluating causal estimators, but remains a
challenging task. Existing generative methods offer a solution by producing
synthetic datasets anchored in the observed data (source data) while allowing
variation in key parameters such as the treatment effect and amount of
confounding bias. However, existing methods typically require users to provide
point estimates of such parameters (rather than distributions) and fixed
estimates (rather than estimates that can be improved with reference to the
source data). This denies users the ability to express uncertainty over
parameter values and removes the potential for posterior inference, potentially
leading to unreliable estimator comparisons. We introduce simulation-based
inference for causal evaluation (SBICE), a framework that models generative
parameters as uncertain and infers their posterior distribution given a source
dataset. Leveraging techniques in simulation-based inference, SBICE identifies
parameter configurations that produce synthetic datasets closely aligned with
the source data distribution. Empirical results demonstrate that SBICE improves
the reliability of estimator evaluations by generating more realistic datasets,
which supports a robust and data-consistent approach to causal benchmarking
under uncertainty.

Abstract: Detecting elephants through seismic signals is an emerging research topic
aimed at developing solutions for Human-Elephant Conflict (HEC). Despite the
promising results, such solutions heavily rely on manual classification of
elephant footfalls, which limits their applicability for real-time
classification in natural settings. To address this limitation and build on our
previous work, this study introduces a classification framework targeting
resource-constrained implementations, prioritizing both accuracy and
computational efficiency. As part of this framework, a novel event detection
technique named Contextually Customized Windowing (CCW), tailored specifically
for detecting elephant footfalls, was introduced, and evaluations were
conducted by comparing it with the Short-Term Average/Long-Term Average
(STA/LTA) method. The yielded results show that the maximum validated detection
range was 155.6 m in controlled conditions and 140 m in natural environments.
Elephant footfall classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a
Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel demonstrated superior performance across
multiple settings, achieving an accuracy of 99% in controlled environments, 73%
in natural elephant habitats, and 70% in HEC-prone human habitats, the most
challenging scenario. Furthermore, feature impact analysis using explainable AI
identified the number of Zero Crossings and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
Alignment Cost as the most influential factors in all experiments, while
Predominant Frequency exhibited significant influence in controlled settings.

Abstract: Offloading footwear helps prevent and treat diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) by
lowering plantar pressure (PP), yet prescription decisions remain fragmented:
feature selection varies, personalization is limited, and evaluation practices
differ. We performed a narrative review of 45 studies (12 guidelines/protocols,
25 knowledge-based systems, 8 machine-learning applications) published to Aug
2025. We thematically analyzed knowledge type, decision logic, evaluation
methods, and enabling technologies. Guidelines emphasize PP thresholds (<=200
kPa or >=25--30\% reduction) but rarely yield actionable, feature-level
outputs. Knowledge-based systems use rule- and sensor-driven logic, integrating
PP monitoring, adherence tracking, and usability testing. ML work introduces
predictive, optimization, and generative models with high computational
accuracy but limited explainability and clinical validation. Evaluation remains
fragmented: protocols prioritize biomechanical tests; knowledge-based systems
assess usability/adherence; ML studies focus on technical accuracy with weak
linkage to long-term outcomes. From this synthesis we propose a five-part CDSS
framework: (1) a minimum viable dataset; (2) a hybrid architecture combining
rules, optimization, and explainable ML; (3) structured feature-level outputs;
(4) continuous validation and evaluation; and (5) integration with clinical and
telehealth workflows. This framework aims to enable scalable, patient-centered
CDSSs for DFU care; prioritizing interoperable datasets, explainable models,
and outcome-focused evaluation will be key to clinical adoption.

Conclusion: PDRL提供了一种简单高效的后处理方案，能够免除集成学习方法的高计算成本，同时避免对已训练模型的影响。

Abstract: Ensemble method is considered the gold standard for uncertainty
quantification (UQ) for machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs).
However, their high computational cost can limit its practicality. Alternative
techniques, such as Monte Carlo dropout and deep kernel learning, have been
proposed to improve computational efficiency; however, some of these methods
cannot be applied to already trained models and may affect the prediction
accuracy. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient post-hoc framework
for UQ that leverages the descriptor of a trained graph neural network
potential to estimate residual errors. We refer to this method as post-hoc
descriptor-based residual-based learning (PDRL). PDRL models the discrepancy
between MLIP predictions and ground truth values, allowing these residuals to
act as proxies for prediction uncertainty. We explore multiple variants of PDRL
and benchmark them against established UQ methods, evaluating both their
effectiveness and limitations.

Abstract: In self-supervised reinforcement learning (RL), one of the key challenges is
learning a diverse set of skills to prepare agents for unknown future tasks.
Despite impressive advances, scalability and evaluation remain prevalent
issues. Regarding scalability, the search for meaningful skills can be obscured
by high-dimensional feature spaces, where relevant features may vary across
downstream task domains. For evaluating skill diversity, defining what
constitutes "diversity" typically requires a hard commitment to a specific
notion of what it means for skills to be diverse, potentially leading to
inconsistencies in how skill diversity is understood, making results across
different approaches hard to compare, and leaving many forms of diversity
unexplored. To address these issues, we adopt a measure of sample diversity
that translates ideas from ecology to machine learning -- the Vendi Score --
allowing the user to specify and evaluate any desired form of diversity. We
demonstrate how this metric facilitates skill evaluation and introduce VendiRL,
a unified framework for learning diversely diverse sets of skills. Given
distinct similarity functions, VendiRL motivates distinct forms of diversity,
which could support skill-diversity pretraining in new and richly interactive
environments where optimising for various forms of diversity may be desirable.

*Chen Zeng,Tiehang Xu,Qiao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出AR-KAN混合模型，结合KAN网络和自回归组件，解决非周期信号叠加问题，在72%真实数据集上表现优于传统方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络在信号频谱分析中存在困难，特别是处理非周期信号叠加问题时表现不佳，传统ARIMA模型在处理非周期函数时甚至优于大型神经网络

Method: 结合Kolmogorov-Arnold网络（KAN）处理静态非线性部分，通过预训练的自回归组件引入记忆机制，基于通用近视映射定理保留有用信息并消除冗余

Result: 实验数据显示AR-KAN在72%的真实世界数据集上取得了优越的结果

Conclusion: AR-KAN混合模型有效解决了非周期信号分析问题，结合了神经网络和传统时间序列方法的优势

Abstract: Conventional neural networks frequently face challenges in spectral analysis
of signals. To address this challenge, Fourier neural networks (FNNs) and
similar approaches integrate components of Fourier series into the structure of
neural networks. Nonetheless, a significant hurdle is often overlooked: the
superposition of periodic signals does not necessarily result in a periodic
signal. For example, when forecasting almost periodic functions composed of
signals with incommensurate frequencies, traditional models such as
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) frequently outperform most
neural networks including large language models (LLMs). To tackle this goal, we
propose Autoregressive-Weight-Enhanced AR-KAN, a hybrid model that combines the
benefits of both methods. Using the Universal Myopic Mapping Theorem, we apply
a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for the static nonlinear part and include
memory through a pre-trained AR component, which can be explained to retain the
most useful information while eliminating redundancy. Experimental data
indicates that AR-KAN delivers superior results on $72\%$ of real-world
datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了D-Byz-SGDM方法，通过延迟动量聚合解决联邦学习中部分参与下的拜占庭攻击问题，在理论和实验上都证明了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有拜占庭鲁棒联邦学习方法假设全客户端参与，但在实际通信约束和客户端可用性下，部分参与是常态。现有方法在采样客户端包含拜占庭多数时会立即失效。

Method: 提出延迟动量聚合原则，服务器聚合非参与客户端的最新接收梯度与活跃客户端的实时动量。开发D-Byz-SGDM优化器实现该原则。

Result: 建立了收敛保证，恢复了全参与结果并匹配部分参与设置的下界。深度学习实验验证了理论发现，在各种拜占庭攻击下显示稳定鲁棒训练。

Conclusion: D-Byz-SGDM方法有效解决了部分参与联邦学习中的拜占庭攻击问题，提供了理论保证和实验验证。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows distributed model training across multiple
clients while preserving data privacy, but it remains vulnerable to Byzantine
clients that exhibit malicious behavior. While existing Byzantine-robust FL
methods provide strong convergence guarantees (e.g., to a stationary point in
expectation) under Byzantine attacks, they typically assume full client
participation, which is unrealistic due to communication constraints and client
availability. Under partial participation, existing methods fail immediately
after the sampled clients contain a Byzantine majority, creating a fundamental
challenge for sparse communication. First, we introduce delayed momentum
aggregation, a novel principle where the server aggregates the most recently
received gradients from non-participating clients alongside fresh momentum from
active clients. Our optimizer D-Byz-SGDM (Delayed Byzantine-robust SGD with
Momentum) implements this delayed momentum aggregation principle for
Byzantine-robust FL with partial participation. Then, we establish convergence
guarantees that recover previous full participation results and match the
fundamental lower bounds we prove for the partial participation setting.
Experiments on deep learning tasks validated our theoretical findings, showing
stable and robust training under various Byzantine attacks.

TL;DR: AdaGO结合正交化动量更新和AdaGrad型自适应步长，在保持正交性更新的同时实现高效自适应学习率调整


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Muon优化器中正交化更新难以确定学习率的问题，同时结合AdaGrad的自适应优势

Method: 将基于范数的AdaGrad步长与正交化更新方向结合，仅需额外计算一个标量变量（累积梯度范数平方）

Result: 在非凸函数上建立了理论收敛率，在CIFAR-10分类和函数回归任务上优于Muon和Adam

Conclusion: AdaGO成功整合了正交化更新和自适应步长的优势，计算高效且性能优异

Abstract: The recently proposed Muon optimizer updates weight matrices via
orthogonalized momentum and has demonstrated strong empirical success in large
language model training. However, it remains unclear how to determine the
learning rates for such orthogonalized updates. AdaGrad, by contrast, is a
widely used adaptive method that scales stochastic gradients by accumulated
past gradients. We propose a new algorithm, AdaGO, which combines a norm-based
AdaGrad-type stepsize with an orthogonalized update direction, bringing
together the benefits of both approaches. Unlike other adaptive variants of
Muon, AdaGO preserves the orthogonality of the update direction, which can be
interpreted as a spectral descent direction, while adapting the stepsizes to
the optimization landscape by scaling the direction with accumulated past
gradient norms. The implementation of AdaGO requires only minimal modification
to Muon, with a single additional scalar variable, the accumulated squared
gradient norms, to be computed, making it computationally and memory efficient.
Optimal theoretical convergence rates are established for nonconvex functions
in both stochastic and deterministic settings under standard smoothness and
unbiased bounded-variance noise assumptions. Empirical results on CIFAR-10
classification and function regression demonstrate that AdaGO outperforms Muon
and Adam.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态数据融合方法，结合高保真X射线数据和低保真吸收率数据来预测激光粉末床熔融过程中的熔池动力学，通过迁移学习实现仅使用低成本吸收率数据就能准确预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监测方法存在局限性：X射线成像成本高且不实用，而低成本光电二极管的吸收率数据噪声大、单独使用预测精度不足。需要找到既能保证精度又经济实用的实时监测方案。

Method: 使用多模态学习框架，结合CNN从X射线数据提取空间特征，RNN从吸收率信号提取时间特征，采用早期融合策略。然后用多模态模型作为迁移学习模型来微调仅使用吸收率数据的RNN模型。

Result: 多模态训练显著提高了预测精度，相比单独使用任一模态。训练后的模型仅需吸收率数据就能推断熔池特性，无需昂贵X射线成像。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了经济高效的实时监测，在增材制造领域具有广泛应用前景，解决了高成本监测设备与低质量单模态数据之间的矛盾。

Abstract: While multiple sensors are used for real-time monitoring in additive
manufacturing, not all provide practical or reliable process insights. For
example, high-speed X-ray imaging offers valuable spatial information about
subsurface melt pool behavior but is costly and impractical for most industrial
settings. In contrast, absorptivity data from low-cost photodiodes correlate
with melt pool dynamics but is often too noisy for accurate prediction when
used alone. In this paper, we propose a multimodal data fusion approach for
predicting melt pool dynamics by combining high-fidelity X-ray data with
low-fidelity absorptivity data in the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) process.
Our multimodal learning framework integrates convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) for spatial feature extraction from X-ray data with recurrent neural
networks (RNNs) for temporal feature extraction from absorptivity signals,
using an early fusion strategy. The multimodal model is further used as a
transfer learning model to fine-tune the RNN model that can predict melt pool
dynamics only with absorptivity, with greater accuracy compared to the
multimodal model. Results show that training with both modalities significantly
improves prediction accuracy compared to using either modality alone.
Furthermore, once trained, the model can infer melt pool characteristics using
only absorptivity data, eliminating the need for expensive X-ray imaging. This
multimodal fusion approach enables cost-effective, real-time monitoring and has
broad applicability in additive manufacturing.

Conclusion: 该方法在共同噪声存在时表现出强大的鲁棒性和适应性，为大规模多智能体系统的纳什均衡学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Mean Field Games (MFGs) offer a powerful framework for studying large-scale
multi-agent systems. Yet, learning Nash equilibria in MFGs remains a
challenging problem, particularly when the initial distribution is unknown or
when the population is subject to common noise. In this paper, we introduce an
efficient deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm designed to achieve
population-dependent Nash equilibria without relying on averaging or historical
sampling, inspired by Munchausen RL and Online Mirror Descent. The resulting
policy is adaptable to various initial distributions and sources of common
noise. Through numerical experiments on seven canonical examples, we
demonstrate that our algorithm exhibits superior convergence properties
compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, particularly a DRL version of
Fictitious Play for population-dependent policies. The performance in the
presence of common noise underscores the robustness and adaptability of our
approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型需要大量内存和计算资源，二进制量化能大幅降低存储和推理成本，但传统的二进制量化方法导致性能显著下降，因此需要提出更有效的量化方法来维持模型质量。

Method: 提出了一种专门为二进制量化设计的新题优化目标，以及三种实现该目标的算法。通过动态识别最优的非结构化子矩阵，使用适应性分组策略来改进块状量化。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的新题优化目标和算法能够在极端的二进制量化下保持模型性能，并且压缩效率极高，为大语言模型的实际部署提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but require
substantial memory and computational resources. Binary quantization, which
compresses model weights from 16-bit Brain Float to 1-bit representations in
{-1, 1}, offers significant reductions in storage and inference costs. However,
such aggressive quantization often leads to notable performance degradation
compared to more conservative 4-bit quantization methods. In this research, we
propose a novel optimization objective tailored for binary quantization, along
with three algorithms designed to realize it effectively. Our method enhances
blocked quantization by dynamically identifying optimal unstructured
sub-matrices through adaptive grouping strategies. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves an average bit length of just 1.007
bits, while maintaining high model quality. Specifically, our quantized LLaMA
3.2 3B model attains a perplexity of 8.23, remarkably close to the original
7.81, and surpasses previous SOTA BiLLM with a perplexity of only 123.90.
Furthermore, our method is competitive with SOTA 4-bit approaches such as GPTQ
in both performance and efficiency. The compression process is highly
efficient, requiring only 14 seconds to quantize the full LLaMA 3.2 3B weights
on a single CPU core, with the entire process completing in under 100 minutes
and exhibiting embarrassingly parallel properties.

<details>

Motivation: 为了更深入理解ReLU神经网络的功能性质，需要一个统一的图论框架来建模网络的离散几何结构，从而提供新的工具来分析、诊断和改善网络的泛化性能。

Method: 扩展ReLU过渡图框架，将每个线性激活区域表示为节点，将相邻区域通过边连接形成图结构。证明了随机初始化时RTG的扩展性质和谱特征，通过区域熵和谱间隔绑定容量和泛化性能。

Result: 实验结果显示，区域熵在过参数化时饱和，谱间隔与泛化性能相关，KL散度反映了功能平滑性。理论预测得到实验验证。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了通过离散几何视角分析ReLU网络的统一框架，为理解、诊断和改善网络泛化性能提供了新工具。

Abstract: We extend the ReLU Transition Graph (RTG) framework into a comprehensive
graph-theoretic model for understanding deep ReLU networks. In this model, each
node represents a linear activation region, and edges connect regions that
differ by a single ReLU activation flip, forming a discrete geometric structure
over the network's functional behavior. We prove that RTGs at random
initialization exhibit strong expansion, binomial degree distributions, and
spectral properties that tightly govern generalization. These structural
insights enable new bounds on capacity via region entropy and on generalization
via spectral gap and edge-wise KL divergence. Empirically, we construct RTGs
for small networks, measure their smoothness and connectivity properties, and
validate theoretical predictions. Our results show that region entropy
saturates under overparameterization, spectral gap correlates with
generalization, and KL divergence across adjacent regions reflects functional
smoothness. This work provides a unified framework for analyzing ReLU networks
through the lens of discrete functional geometry, offering new tools to
understand, diagnose, and improve generalization.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown that their
reasoning capabilities can be significantly improved through Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR), particularly in domains like
mathematics and programming, where ground-truth correctness can be
automatically evaluated. However, extending this success to other
reasoning-intensive domains remains challenging due to the scarcity of
high-quality, verifiable datasets and the high cost of human supervision. In
this work, we introduce the Loong Project: an open-source framework for
scalable synthetic data generation and verification across a diverse range of
reasoning-intensive domains. The framework consists of two key components: (1)
LoongBench, a curated seed dataset containing 8,729 human-vetted examples
across 12 domains (e.g., Advanced Mathematics, Chemistry, Logic), each paired
with executable code and rich metadata; and (2) LoongEnv, a modular synthetic
data generation environment that supports multiple prompting strategies to
produce new question-answer-code triples. Together, these components form an
agent-environment loop that enables reinforcement learning, where an LLM-based
agent is rewarded for generating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) solutions that align
with code-executed answers. Empirically, we benchmark LoongBench on a broad
suite of both open-source and proprietary LLMs to evaluate domain coverage and
reveal performance bottlenecks. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive
analysis of synthetic data generated by LoongEnv, examining correctness,
difficulty, and diversity. Code and documentation are available at

Conclusion: LimiX证明了单一模型处理多样化表格任务的可行性，为结构化数据基础模型的发展奠定了基础

Abstract: We argue that progress toward general intelligence requires complementary
foundation models grounded in language, the physical world, and structured
data. This report presents LimiX, the first installment of our large
structured-data models (LDMs). LimiX treats structured data as a joint
distribution over variables and missingness, thus capable of addressing a wide
range of tabular tasks through query-based conditional prediction via a single
model. LimiX is pretrained using masked joint-distribution modeling with an
episodic, context-conditional objective, where the model predicts for query
subsets conditioned on dataset-specific contexts, supporting rapid,
training-free adaptation at inference. We evaluate LimiX across 10 large
structured-data benchmarks with broad regimes of sample size, feature
dimensionality, class number, categorical-to-numerical feature ratio,
missingness, and sample-to-feature ratios. With a single model and a unified
interface, LimiX consistently surpasses strong baselines including
gradient-boosting trees, deep tabular networks, recent tabular foundation
models, and automated ensembles, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The
superiority holds across a wide range of tasks, such as classification,
regression, missing value imputation, and data generation, often by substantial
margins, while avoiding task-specific architectures or bespoke training per
task. All LimiX models are publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.

while offering superior efficiency. LSAM integrates SAM's adversarial steps

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DRL交通信号控制存在两种范式："选择相位"策略可能导致不可预测的相位序列影响驾驶安全，"切换"策略虽然保持可预测性但可能导致相位分配不公平和低效

Method: 提出深度分层周期规划器(DHCP)，采用分层控制：高层代理根据整体交通状态确定南北和东西方向的总周期时间分配，低层代理在每个主要方向内进一步分配直行和左转运动的时长

Result: 在真实和合成路网以及多组真实和合成交通流上进行测试，实证结果显示模型在所有数据集上相对于基线方法都取得了最佳性能

Conclusion: DHCP模型通过分层周期时长分配机制，既保持了相位序列的可预测性，又实现了更灵活和高效的交通信号控制

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a popular approach in traffic
signal control (TSC) due to its ability to learn adaptive policies from complex
traffic environments. Within DRL-based TSC methods, two primary control
paradigms are ``choose phase" and ``switch" strategies. Although the agent in
the choose phase paradigm selects the next active phase adaptively, this
paradigm may result in unexpected phase sequences for drivers, disrupting their
anticipation and potentially compromising safety at intersections. Meanwhile,
the switch paradigm allows the agent to decide whether to switch to the next
predefined phase or extend the current phase. While this structure maintains a
more predictable order, it can lead to unfair and inefficient phase
allocations, as certain movements may be extended disproportionately while
others are neglected. In this paper, we propose a DRL model, named Deep
Hierarchical Cycle Planner (DHCP), to allocate the traffic signal cycle
duration hierarchically. A high-level agent first determines the split of the
total cycle time between the North-South (NS) and East-West (EW) directions
based on the overall traffic state. Then, a low-level agent further divides the
allocated duration within each major direction between straight and left-turn
movements, enabling more flexible durations for the two movements. We test our
model on both real and synthetic road networks, along with multiple sets of
real and synthetic traffic flows. Empirical results show our model achieves the
best performance over all datasets against baselines.

Abstract: Liquid scintillation triple-to-doubly coincident ratio (TDCR) spectroscopy is
widely adopted as a standard method for radionuclide quantification because of
its inherent advantages such as high precision, self-calibrating capability,
and independence from radioactive reference sources. However, multiradionuclide
analysis via TDCR faces the challenges of limited automation and reliance on
mixture-specific standards, which may not be easily available. Here, we present
an Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework that combines numerical spectral
simulation and deep learning for standard-free automated analysis. $\beta$
spectra for model training were generated using Geant4 simulations coupled with
statistically modeled detector response sampling. A tailored neural network
architecture, trained on this dataset covering various nuclei mix ratio and
quenching scenarios, enables autonomous resolution of individual radionuclide
activities and detecting efficiency through end-to-end learning paradigms. The
model delivers consistent high accuracy across tasks: activity proportions
(mean absolute error = 0.009), detection efficiencies (mean absolute error =
0.002), and spectral reconstruction (Structural Similarity Index = 0.9998),
validating its physical plausibility for quenched $\beta$ spectroscopy. This
AI-driven methodology exhibits significant potential for automated
safety-compliant multiradionuclide analysis with robust generalization,
real-time processing capabilities, and engineering feasibility, particularly in
scenarios where reference materials are unavailable or rapid field analysis is
required.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is essential for validating and trusting models in
safety-critical applications like autonomous driving. However, the reliability
of XAI is challenged by the Rashomon effect, where multiple, equally accurate
models can offer divergent explanations for the same prediction. This paper
provides the first empirical quantification of this effect for the task of
action prediction in real-world driving scenes. Using Qualitative Explainable
Graphs (QXGs) as a symbolic scene representation, we train Rashomon sets of two
distinct model classes: interpretable, pair-based gradient boosting models and
complex, graph-based Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Using feature attribution
methods, we measure the agreement of explanations both within and between these
classes. Our results reveal significant explanation disagreement. Our findings
suggest that explanation ambiguity is an inherent property of the problem, not
just a modeling artifact.

*Serra Aksoy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种免阈值的评估框架，解决了归因方法评估中的阈值选择偏差问题，通过AUC-IoU指标在医学图像预测中实现了更稳健的方法比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前归因方法评估存在阈值选择偏差，单一阈值的选择可能导致方法排名的巨大反转（超100%变化），影响研究结论的可靠性。

Method: 提出免阈值框架，使用AUC-IoU（面积下交并比聚合曲线）指标来评估归因方法在全阈值范围内的性能。在皮肤病学图像数据集上对七种归因方法进行了评估。

Result: 免阈值评估提供了可靠的方法差异化：XRAI比LIME提升30%性能，比零基硅分积提升204%性能。样本大小分层分析显示不同病变规模下性能差异达269%。

Conclusion: 该免阈值框架消除了评估偏差，为归因方法提供了理论见解和实践指南，在医学图像及其他领域实现了稳健的方法比较。

Abstract: Attribution methods explain neural network predictions by identifying
influential input features, but their evaluation suffers from threshold
selection bias that can reverse method rankings and undermine conclusions.
Current protocols binarize attribution maps at single thresholds, where
threshold choice alone can alter rankings by over 200 percentage points. We
address this flaw with a threshold-free framework that computes Area Under the
Curve for Intersection over Union (AUC-IoU), capturing attribution quality
across the full threshold spectrum. Evaluating seven attribution methods on
dermatological imaging, we show single-threshold metrics yield contradictory
results, while threshold-free evaluation provides reliable differentiation.
XRAI achieves 31% improvement over LIME and 204% over vanilla Integrated
Gradients, with size-stratified analysis revealing performance variations up to
269% across lesion scales. These findings establish methodological standards
that eliminate evaluation artifacts and enable evidence-based method selection.
The threshold-free framework provides both theoretical insight into attribution
behavior and practical guidance for robust comparison in medical imaging and
beyond.

TL;DR: 本文应用TabPFN基础模型于地质工程场地特征分析，在两个标准问题中实现了更高准确度和更快速度的预测，显示了基础模型在地质工程预测中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索TabPFN基础模型在地质工程场地特征分析中的应用潜力，通过零训练、少样本学习方式提高预测准确性和效率。

Method: 使用TabPFN基础模型进行零训练、少样本、上下文学习，无需调参，并给予间接数据库上下文，处理空间剪切强度预测和缺失机械参数插值任务。

Result: 在标准问题#1中，TabPFN预测准确性超过传统汇列贝叶斯模型，运行速度提升10倍；在标准问题#2中，TabPFN对所有目标参数均获得更低RMSE，但计算成本略高。

Conclusion: TabPFN作为通用基础模型，在地质工程预测中实现了更高准确性和效率，标志着基础模型在概率性场地特征分析中的首次成功应用，展示了潜在的范式转变。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel application of the Tabular Prior-Data Fitted
Network (TabPFN) - a transformer-based foundation model for tabular data - to
geotechnical site characterization problems defined in the GEOAI benchmark
BM/AirportSoilProperties/2/2025. Two tasks are addressed: (1) predicting the
spatial variation of undrained shear strength (su) across borehole depth
profiles, and (2) imputing missing mechanical parameters in a dense-site
dataset. We apply TabPFN in a zero-training, few-shot, in-context learning
setting - without hyper-parameter tuning - and provide it with additional
context from the big indirect database (BID). The study demonstrates that
TabPFN, as a general-purpose foundation model, achieved superior accuracy and
well-calibrated predictive distributions compared to a conventional
hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM) baseline, while also offering significant
gains in inference efficiency. In Benchmark Problem #1 (spatial su prediction),
TabPFN outperformed the HBM in prediction accuracy and delivered an
order-of-magnitude faster runtime. In Benchmark Problem #2 (missing mechanical
parameter imputation), TabPFN likewise achieved lower RMSE for all target
parameters with well-quantified uncertainties, though its cumulative
computation cost was higher than HBM's due to its one-variable-at-a-time
inference. These results mark the first successful use of a tabular foundation
model in geotechnical modeling, suggesting a potential paradigm shift in
probabilistic site characterization.

Conclusion: 本文填补了公平决策树研究的设计空间空白，证明了回溯约束方法和双树独立建模方法的有效性，为未来公平机器学习算法设计提供了新的思路和方向。

Abstract: Decision trees have been studied extensively in the context of fairness,
aiming to maximize prediction performance while ensuring non-discrimination
against different groups. Techniques in this space usually focus on imposing
constraints at training time, constraining the search space so that solutions
which display unacceptable values of relevant metrics are not considered,
discarded, or discouraged. If we assume one target variable y and one sensitive
attribute s, the design space of tree learning algorithms can be spanned as
follows: (i) One can have one tree T that is built using an objective function
that is a function of y, s, and T. For instance, one can build a tree based on
the weighted information gain regarding y (maximizing) and s (minimizing). (ii)
The second option is to have one tree model T that uses an objective function
in y and T and a constraint on s and T. Here, s is no longer part of the
objective, but part of a constraint. This can be achieved greedily by aborting
a further split as soon as the condition that optimizes the objective in y
fails to satisfy the constraint on s. A simple way to explore other splits is
to backtrack during tree construction once a fairness constraint is violated.
(iii) The third option is to have two trees T_y and T_s, one for y and one for
s, such that the tree structure for y and s does not have to be shared. In this
way, information regarding y and regarding s can be used independently, without
having to constrain the choices in tree construction by the mutual information
between the two variables. Quite surprisingly, of the three options, only the
first one and the greedy variant of the second have been studied in the
literature so far. In this paper, we introduce the above two additional options
from that design space and characterize them experimentally on multiple
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GCSL框架的两个主要限制：1)仅从自生成经验学习会加剧智能体固有偏见；2)目标重标记策略使智能体只关注成功结果，无法从错误中学习

Method: 将对比学习原理整合到GCSL框架中，使智能体能够同时从成功和失败的经验中学习

Conclusion: 通过整合对比学习到GCSL框架，成功解决了自模仿学习的局限性，实现了从成功和失败中同时学习的能力，显著提升了强化学习在稀疏奖励任务中的表现

Abstract: Reinforcement learning faces significant challenges when applied to tasks
characterized by sparse reward structures. Although imitation learning, within
the domain of supervised learning, offers faster convergence, it relies heavily
on human-generated demonstrations. Recently, Goal-Conditioned Supervised
Learning (GCSL) has emerged as a potential solution by enabling self-imitation
learning for autonomous systems. By strategically relabelling goals, agents can
derive policy insights from their own experiences. Despite the successes of
this framework, it presents two notable limitations: (1) Learning exclusively
from self-generated experiences can exacerbate the agents' inherent biases; (2)
The relabelling strategy allows agents to focus solely on successful outcomes,
precluding them from learning from their mistakes. To address these issues, we
propose a novel model that integrates contrastive learning principles into the
GCSL framework to learn from both success and failure. Through empirical
evaluations, we demonstrate that our algorithm overcomes limitations imposed by
agents' initial biases and thereby enables more exploratory behavior. This
facilitates the identification and adoption of effective policies, leading to
superior performance across a variety of challenging environments.

TL;DR: TeRA是一种新颖的参数高效微调方法，通过张量网络实现高秩权重更新，同时保持向量化方法的参数效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有LoRA风格适配器在高表达性和参数效率之间的权衡问题，高秩适配器需要更多参数，而向量化方法牺牲了表达性

Method: 使用Tucker-like张量网络参数化权重更新矩阵，冻结大型随机初始化因子并在层间共享，只训练由对角因子矩阵条目组成的小型层特定缩放向量

Result: TeRA匹配甚至超越高秩适配器的性能，同时只需要与向量化方法相似的训练参数量

Conclusion: TeRA有效解耦了权重更新矩阵的秩与可训练参数数量，在保持参数效率的同时实现了高表达性

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), have significantly reduced the number of trainable parameters needed in
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Subsequent developments of LoRA-style
adapters have diverged into two main directions: (1) enhancing model
expressivity with high-rank adapters, and (2) pushing for further parameter
reduction, as exemplified by vector-based methods. However, these approaches
present a trade-off, as achieving the expressivity of high-rank weight updates
typically comes at the cost of sacrificing the extreme parameter efficiency
offered by vector-based techniques. To address this issue, we propose a
vector-based random \underline{\textbf{Te}}nsor network for
high-\underline{\textbf{R}}ank \underline{\textbf{A}}daptation (TeRA), a novel
PEFT method that achieves high-rank weight updates while retaining the
parameter efficiency of vector-based PEFT adapters. This is achieved by
parameterizing the tensorized weight update matrix as a Tucker-like tensor
network (TN), in which large randomly initialized factors are frozen and shared
across layers, while only small layer-specific scaling vectors, formed by
entries in diagonal factor matrices, are trained. This design effectively
decouples the rank of the weight update matrix from the number of trainable
parameters. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TeRA matches or even
outperforms high-rank adapters, while requiring a trainable parameter count
similar to vector-based methods. Theoretical analysis and ablation studies
further validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了窗口F1指标(F1_w)来解决时间序列事件检测评估中的问题，该指标包含时间容差，能够更稳健地评估真实世界不平衡数据集中的模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在可穿戴设备压力监测等应用中，地面实况通常被标注为单点事件，但实际现象是渐进的且时间上分散的。标准指标如F1和点调整F1(F1_pa)在这种现实世界不平衡数据集中经常错误地表示模型性能。

Method: 引入窗口F1指标(F1_w)，该指标包含时间容差，允许在精确对齐不现实的情况下进行更稳健的事件检测评估。在三个生理数据集(两个野外数据集ADARP、Wrist Angel和一个实验数据集ROAD)上进行实证分析。

Result: F1_w揭示了传统指标无法发现的有意义的模型性能模式，其窗口大小可以根据领域知识进行调整以避免高估。使用TimesFM的预测结果显示，只有时间容差指标才能揭示在两个野外用例中相对于随机和零基线的统计显著改进。

Conclusion: 这项工作解决了时间序列评估中的关键差距，并为医疗保健应用提供了实用指导，其中对时间精度的要求因上下文而异。

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of event detection in time series is essential for
applications such as stress monitoring with wearable devices, where ground
truth is typically annotated as single-point events, even though the underlying
phenomena are gradual and temporally diffused. Standard metrics like F1 and
point-adjusted F1 (F1$_{pa}$) often misrepresent model performance in such
real-world, imbalanced datasets. We introduce a window-based F1 metric (F1$_w$)
that incorporates temporal tolerance, enabling a more robust assessment of
event detection when exact alignment is unrealistic. Empirical analysis in
three physiological datasets, two in-the-wild (ADARP, Wrist Angel) and one
experimental (ROAD), indicates that F1$_w$ reveals meaningful model performance
patterns invisible to conventional metrics, while its window size can be
adapted to domain knowledge to avoid overestimation. We show that the choice of
evaluation metric strongly influences the interpretation of model performance:
using predictions from TimesFM, only our temporally tolerant metrics reveal
statistically significant improvements over random and null baselines in the
two in-the-wild use cases. This work addresses key gaps in time series
evaluation and provides practical guidance for healthcare applications where
requirements for temporal precision vary by context.

Conclusion: 基于神经网络的RIS元素分配方案能够有效解决传统方法的计算复杂度问题，在提升系统性能的同时实现更好的可扩展性

Abstract: The increasing demand for high data rates and seamless connectivity in
wireless systems has sparked significant interest in reconfigurable intelligent
surfaces (RIS) and artificial intelligence-based wireless applications. RIS
typically comprises passive reflective antenna elements that control the
wireless propagation environment by adequately tuning the phase of the
reflective elements. The allocation of RIS elements to multipleuser equipment
(UEs) is crucial for efficiently utilizing RIS. In this work, we formulate a
joint optimization problem that optimizes the RIS phase configuration and
resource allocation under an $\alpha$-fair scheduling framework and propose an
efficient way of allocating RIS elements. Conventional iterative optimization
methods, however, suffer from exponentially increasing computational complexity
as the number of RIS elements increases and also complicate the generation of
training labels for supervised learning. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a five-layer fully connected neural network (FNN) combined with a
preprocessing technique to significantly reduce input dimensionality, lower
computational complexity, and enhance scalability. The simulation results show
that our proposed NN-based solution reduces computational overhead while
significantly improving system throughput by 6.8% compared to existing RIS
element allocation schemes. Furthermore, the proposed system achieves better
performance while reducing computational complexity, making it significantly
more scalable than the iterative optimization algorithms.

Conclusion: FoMEMO为昂贵多目标优化提供了新的解决方案，通过合成数据预训练的基础模型实现了对未知问题的快速适应和优异性能。

Abstract: Expensive multi-objective optimization is a prevalent and crucial concern in
many real-world scenarios, where sample-efficiency is vital due to the limited
evaluations to recover the true Pareto front for decision making. Existing
works either involve rebuilding Gaussian process surrogates from scratch for
each objective in each new problem encountered, or rely on extensive past
domain experiments for pre-training deep learning models, making them hard to
generalize and impractical to cope with various emerging applications in the
real world. To address this issue, we propose a new paradigm named FoMEMO
(Foundation Models for Expensive Multi-objective Optimization), which enables
the establishment of a foundation model conditioned on any domain trajectory
and user preference, and facilitates fast in-context optimization based on the
predicted preference-wise aggregation posteriors. Rather than accessing
extensive domain experiments in the real world, we demonstrate that
pre-training the foundation model with a diverse set of hundreds of millions of
synthetic data can lead to superior adaptability to unknown problems, without
necessitating any subsequent model training or updates in the optimization
process. We evaluate our method across a variety of synthetic benchmarks and
real-word applications, and demonstrate its superior generality and competitive
performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Representation choice is of fundamental importance to our ability to
communicate and reason effectively. A major unsolved problem, addressed in this
paper, is how to devise \textit{representational-system (RS) agnostic}
techniques that drive representation transformation and choice. We present a
novel calculus, called \textit{structure transfer}, that enables representation
transformation across diverse RSs. Specifically, given a \textit{source}
representation drawn from a source RS, the rules of structure transfer allow us
to generate a \textit{target} representation for a target RS. The generality of
structure transfer comes in part from its ability to ensure that the source
representation and the generated target representation satisfy \textit{any}
specified relation (such as semantic equivalence). This is done by exploiting
\textit{schemas}, which encode knowledge about RSs. Specifically, schemas can
express \textit{preservation of information} across relations between any pair
of RSs, and this knowledge is used by structure transfer to derive a structure
for the target representation which ensures that the desired relation holds. We
formalise this using Representational Systems Theory~\cite{raggi2022rst},
building on the key concept of a \textit{construction space}. The abstract
nature of construction spaces grants them the generality to model RSs of
diverse kinds, including formal languages, geometric figures and diagrams, as
well as informal notations. Consequently, structure transfer is a
system-agnostic calculus that can be used to identify alternative
representations in a wide range of practical settings.

TL;DR: HyPV-LEAD是一个用于加密货币异常交易早期检测的框架，通过窗口-视野建模、峰谷采样和双曲嵌入技术，在比特币交易数据上实现了0.9624的PR-AUC性能，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加密货币异常交易（如混币服务、欺诈转账、拉盘砸盘）对金融完整性构成日益严重的风险，但由于类别不平衡、时间波动性和复杂网络依赖关系，检测异常交易非常困难。现有方法主要是模型中心化和事后检测，只能在异常发生后标记，预防价值有限。

Result: 在大规模比特币交易数据上的实证评估显示，HyPV-LEAD始终优于最先进的基线方法，实现了0.9624的PR-AUC，在精确率和召回率方面都有显著提升。消融研究证实每个组件都提供互补的益处。

Conclusion: 通过将异常检测从反应式分类转变为主动式早期预警，HyPV-LEAD为实时风险管理、反洗钱合规和动态区块链环境中的金融安全建立了坚实基础。

Abstract: Abnormal cryptocurrency transactions - such as mixing services, fraudulent
transfers, and pump-and-dump operations -- pose escalating risks to financial
integrity but remain notoriously difficult to detect due to class imbalance,
temporal volatility, and complex network dependencies. Existing approaches are
predominantly model-centric and post hoc, flagging anomalies only after they
occur and thus offering limited preventive value. This paper introduces
HyPV-LEAD (Hyperbolic Peak-Valley Lead-time Enabled Anomaly Detection), a
data-driven early-warning framework that explicitly incorporates lead time into
anomaly detection. Unlike prior methods, HyPV-LEAD integrates three
innovations: (1) window-horizon modeling to guarantee actionable lead-time
alerts, (2) Peak-Valley (PV) sampling to mitigate class imbalance while
preserving temporal continuity, and (3) hyperbolic embedding to capture the
hierarchical and scale-free properties of blockchain transaction networks.
Empirical evaluation on large-scale Bitcoin transaction data demonstrates that
HyPV-LEAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a
PR-AUC of 0.9624 with significant gains in precision and recall. Ablation
studies further confirm that each component - PV sampling, hyperbolic
embedding, and structural-temporal modeling - provides complementary benefits,
with the full framework delivering the highest performance. By shifting anomaly
detection from reactive classification to proactive early-warning, HyPV-LEAD
establishes a robust foundation for real-time risk management, anti-money
laundering (AML) compliance, and financial security in dynamic blockchain
environments.

Abstract: Missing data represents a fundamental challenge in machine learning
applications, often reducing model performance and reliability. This problem is
particularly acute in fields like bioinformatics and clinical machine learning,
where datasets are frequently incomplete due to the nature of both data
generation and data collection. While numerous imputation methods exist, from
simple statistical techniques to advanced deep learning models, no single
method consistently performs well across diverse datasets and missingness
mechanisms. This paper proposes a novel Meta-Imputation approach that learns to
combine the outputs of multiple base imputers to predict missing values more
accurately. By training the proposed method called Meta-Imputation Balanced
(MIB) on synthetically masked data with known ground truth, the system learns
to predict the most suitable imputed value based on the behavior of each
method. Our work highlights the potential of ensemble learning in imputation
and paves the way for more robust, modular, and interpretable preprocessing
pipelines in real-world machine learning systems.

Abstract: In traffic engineering, the fixed-time traffic signal control remains widely
used for its low cost, stability, and interpretability. However, its design
depends on hand-crafted formulas (e.g., Webster) and manual re-timing by
engineers to adapt to demand changes, which is labor-intensive and often yields
suboptimal results under heterogeneous or congested conditions. This paper
introduces the EvolveSignal, a large language models (LLMs) powered coding
agent to automatically discover new traffic signal control algorithms. We
formulate the problem as program synthesis, where candidate algorithms are
represented as Python functions with fixed input-output structures, and
iteratively optimized through external evaluations (e.g., a traffic simulator)
and evolutionary search. Experiments on a signalized intersection demonstrate
that the discovered algorithms outperform Webster's baseline, reducing average

incremental analyses reveal that EvolveSignal modifications-such as adjusting

*Fleur Hendriks,Ondřej Rokoš,Martin Doškář,Marc G. D. Geers,Vlado Menkovski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 基于流匹配的生成式框架，用于建模分叉现象中的多模态分布，解决传统机器学习方法无法捕捉多重稳定解的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非线性动力系统中的分叉现象导致多重稳定解共存，特别是在对称性破碎情况下。确定性机器学习模型无法捕捉这种多重性，会平均化各个解而失去低对称性结果

Method: 提出基于流匹配的生成式框架，通过等变模型保持系统对称性。使用对称匹配策略，在群作用下对齐预测和目标输出，以便在等变设置中进行准确学习

Result: 在从玩具模型到复杂物理问题（如屈曲梁和Allen-Cahn方程）的一系列系统中验证了方法。流匹配在捕捉多模态分布和对称性破碎分叉方面显著超过非概率和变分方法

Conclusion: 该方法为高维系统中的多稳定性建模提供了一种有理论基础且可扩展的解决方案，能够直接采样多个有效解并保持系统对称性

Abstract: Bifurcation phenomena in nonlinear dynamical systems often lead to multiple
coexisting stable solutions, particularly in the presence of symmetry breaking.
Deterministic machine learning models struggle to capture this multiplicity,
averaging over solutions and failing to represent lower-symmetry outcomes. In
this work, we propose a generative framework based on flow matching to model
the full probability distribution over bifurcation outcomes. Our method enables
direct sampling of multiple valid solutions while preserving system symmetries
through equivariant modeling. We introduce a symmetric matching strategy that
aligns predicted and target outputs under group actions, allowing accurate
learning in equivariant settings. We validate our approach on a range of
systems, from toy models to complex physical problems such as buckling beams
and the Allen-Cahn equation. Our results demonstrate that flow matching
significantly outperforms non-probabilistic and variational methods in
capturing multimodal distributions and symmetry-breaking bifurcations, offering
a principled and scalable solution for modeling multistability in
high-dimensional systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过理论分析和实验验证，结论GAN模型在差分隐私条件下比扩散模型更能抵御成员推断攻击，显示了模型类型对隐私泄漏的关键影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然GAN和扩散模型都可在差分隐私下训练，但它们对成员推断攻击的敏感性仍不明确，需要统一的理论和实践分析来评估隐私风险。

Method: 采用基于稳定性的分析方法证明GAN模型对数据干扰的敏感性低于扩散模型，并通过标准化的MIA测试流程进行综合实验验证。

Result: 实验结果一致显示GAN模型在隐私保护方面显著优于扩散模型，甚至在强DP治下也保持更好的隐私稳健性。

Conclusion: 模型类型本身是影响隐私泄漏的关键因素，GAN模型在抵御成员推断攻击方面具有结构性优势。

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion models have emerged as
leading approaches for high-quality image synthesis. While both can be trained
under differential privacy (DP) to protect sensitive data, their sensitivity to
membership inference attacks (MIAs), a key threat to data confidentiality,
remains poorly understood. In this work, we present the first unified
theoretical and empirical analysis of the privacy risks faced by differentially
private generative models. We begin by showing, through a stability-based
analysis, that GANs exhibit fundamentally lower sensitivity to data
perturbations than diffusion models, suggesting a structural advantage in
resisting MIAs. We then validate this insight with a comprehensive empirical
study using a standardized MIA pipeline to evaluate privacy leakage across
datasets and privacy budgets. Our results consistently reveal a marked privacy
robustness gap in favor of GANs, even in strong DP regimes, highlighting that
model type alone can critically shape privacy leakage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表位设计面临组合序列空间巨大的挑战，传统筛选方法不可行，需要新的生成方法来创建可行的表位候选库

Method: 开发基于蛋白质数据预训练的epiGPTope语言模型，针对线性表位微调，直接生成表位样序列；训练统计分类器预测序列来源

Result: 生成的序列具有与已知表位相似的统计特性，能够创建表位候选库并通过分类器缩小搜索范围

Conclusion: 生成式与预测式模型结合的方法可辅助表位发现，仅需氨基酸序列，无需几何框架或手工特征，有望加速新型生物技术开发

Abstract: Epitopes are short antigenic peptide sequences which are recognized by
antibodies or immune cell receptors. These are central to the development of
immunotherapies, vaccines, and diagnostics. However, the rational design of
synthetic epitope libraries is challenging due to the large combinatorial
sequence space, $20^n$ combinations for linear epitopes of n amino acids,
making screening and testing unfeasible, even with high throughput experimental
techniques. In this study, we present a large language model, epiGPTope,
pre-trained on protein data and specifically fine-tuned on linear epitopes,
which for the first time can directly generate novel epitope-like sequences,
which are found to possess statistical properties analogous to the ones of
known epitopes. This generative approach can be used to prepare libraries of
epitope candidate sequences. We further train statistical classifiers to
predict whether an epitope sequence is of bacterial or viral origin, thus
narrowing the candidate library and increasing the likelihood of identifying
specific epitopes. We propose that such combination of generative and
predictive models can be of assistance in epitope discovery. The approach uses
only primary amino acid sequences of linear epitopes, bypassing the need for a
geometric framework or hand-crafted features of the sequences. By developing a
method to create biologically feasible sequences, we anticipate faster and more
cost-effective generation and screening of synthetic epitopes, with relevant
applications in the development of new biotechnologies.

Motivation: 传统资源分配方法忽视了智能体不同的计算能力和复杂操作环境，导致资源分配效率低下且不公平，需要一种能够确保公平性的资源分配框架。

Method: 开发了Fair-Synergy算法框架，扩展传统分配方法以涵盖由模型参数、训练数据量和任务复杂性定义的多维机器学习效用景观，利用智能体准确性与资源之间的凹关系进行公平分配。

Result: 在BERT、VGG16、MobileNet、ResNets等先进模型和MNIST、CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、BDD、GLUE等数据集上评估，Fair-Synergy在多智能体推理中比标准基准提升25%，在多智能体学习中提升11%。

Conclusion: 该框架为公平的群体智能提供了有效解决方案，并深入探讨了公平性水平对不同优势程度智能体的影响，为公平资源分配提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Resource allocation is crucial for the performance optimization of
cloud-assisted multi-agent intelligence. Traditional methods often overlook
agents' diverse computational capabilities and complex operating environments,
leading to inefficient and unfair resource distribution. To address this, we
open-sourced Fair-Synergy, an algorithmic framework that utilizes the concave
relationship between the agents' accuracy and the system resources to ensure
fair resource allocation across fleet intelligence. We extend traditional
allocation approaches to encompass a multidimensional machine learning utility
landscape defined by model parameters, training data volume, and task
complexity. We evaluate Fair-Synergy with advanced vision and language models
such as BERT, VGG16, MobileNet, and ResNets on datasets including MNIST,
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, BDD, and GLUE. We demonstrate that Fair-Synergy
outperforms standard benchmarks by up to 25% in multi-agent inference and 11%
in multi-agent learning settings. Also, we explore how the level of fairness
affects the least advantaged, most advantaged, and average agents, providing
insights for equitable fleet intelligence.

Motivation: 探索夏令时制对不同国家睡眠时长的影响，并考虑地理位置的调节作用

Method: 采用61个国家的睡眠数据，进行统计相关分析，按DST实施情况分组，通过可视化比较睡眠模式

Result: 整体而言DST国家睡眠时长更长，但纬度分析显示低纬度区域DST国家睡眠更短，高纬度区域DST国家睡眠更长

Conclusion: 夏令时制对睡眠的影响受到地理位置的显著调节，纬度是重要的调节因素

Abstract: In this study we analyzed average sleep durations across 61 countries to
examine the impact of Daylight Saving Time (DST) practices. Key metrics
influencing sleep were identified, and statistical correlation analysis was
applied to explore relationships among these factors. Countries were grouped
based on DST observance, and visualizations compared sleep patterns between DST
and non-DST regions. Results show that, on average, countries observing DST
tend to report longer sleep durations than those that do not. A more detailed
pattern emerged when accounting for latitude: at lower latitudes, DST-observing
countries reported shorter sleep durations compared to non-DST countries, while
at higher latitudes, DST-observing countries reported longer average sleep
durations. These findings suggest that the influence of DST on sleep may be
moderated by geographical location.

Motivation: 传统校准研究主要集中在概率预测，而对似然函数校准的研究相对较少，特别是在多假设情况下。本文旨在将二元假设下的似然比校准理论扩展到多类别场景。

Method: 使用Aitchison几何和单纯形空间理论，将似然比的概念扩展到多假设情况，定义等距对数比变换的似然函数，并建立相应的校准定义、幂等性性质和分布约束条件。

Conclusion: 本文为多假设情况下的似然函数校准提供了理论基础和数学框架，通过等距对数比变换实现了贝叶斯规则的向量形式扩展，提高了机器学习方法的可解释性和可靠性。

Abstract: While calibration of probabilistic predictions has been widely studied, this
paper rather addresses calibration of likelihood functions. This has been
discussed, especially in biometrics, in cases with only two exhaustive and
mutually exclusive hypotheses (classes) where likelihood functions can be
written as log-likelihood-ratios (LLRs). After defining calibration for LLRs
and its connection with the concept of weight-of-evidence, we present the
idempotence property and its associated constraint on the distribution of the
LLRs. Although these results have been known for decades, they have been
limited to the binary case. Here, we extend them to cases with more than two
hypotheses by using the Aitchison geometry of the simplex, which allows us to
recover, in a vector form, the additive form of the Bayes' rule; extending
therefore the LLR and the weight-of-evidence to any number of hypotheses.
Especially, we extend the definition of calibration, the idempotence, and the
constraint on the distribution of likelihood functions to this multiple
hypotheses and multiclass counterpart of the LLR: the isometric-log-ratio
transformed likelihood function. This work is mainly conceptual, but we still
provide one application to machine learning by presenting a non-linear
discriminant analysis where the discriminant components form a calibrated
likelihood function over the classes, improving therefore the interpretability
and the reliability of the method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态学习中模态缺失和有限标注数据的关键挑战，提升模型的鲁棒性和实用性。

Method: 提出软正未标注(PU)对比损失最大化任务相关特征对齐，以及潜在重建损失确保模态特定信息保留，采用模块化设计。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验验证表明，Robult在半监督学习和模态缺失场景下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架轻量可扩展，能无缝集成到现有架构中，适用于实际多模态应用场景。

Abstract: Addressing missing modalities and limited labeled data is crucial for
advancing robust multimodal learning. We propose Robult, a scalable framework
designed to mitigate these challenges by preserving modality-specific
information and leveraging redundancy through a novel information-theoretic
approach. Robult optimizes two core objectives: (1) a soft Positive-Unlabeled
(PU) contrastive loss that maximizes task-relevant feature alignment while
effectively utilizing limited labeled data in semi-supervised settings, and (2)
a latent reconstruction loss that ensures unique modality-specific information
is retained. These strategies, embedded within a modular design, enhance
performance across various downstream tasks and ensure resilience to incomplete
modalities during inference. Experimental results across diverse datasets
validate that Robult achieves superior performance over existing approaches in
both semi-supervised learning and missing modality contexts. Furthermore, its
lightweight design promotes scalability and seamless integration with existing
architectures, making it suitable for real-world multimodal applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: t-SNE和UMAP等降维方法在可视化潜在聚类结构数据时，虽然能很好分离聚类并保留局部信息，但往往会扭曲数据的全局几何结构

Method: 采用模块化方法：首先对数据进行聚类，然后分别嵌入每个聚类，最后对齐所有聚类以获得全局嵌入

Result: 在多个合成和真实数据集上验证，该方法与现有方法竞争力相当，但透明度更高

Conclusion: 这种模块化的聚类-嵌入-对齐方法提供了一种更透明、能更好保持全局几何结构的降维可视化方案

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction methods such as t-SNE and UMAP are popular methods
for visualizing data with a potential (latent) clustered structure. They are
known to group data points at the same time as they embed them, resulting in
visualizations with well-separated clusters that preserve local information
well. However, t-SNE and UMAP also tend to distort the global geometry of the
underlying data. We propose a more transparent, modular approach consisting of
first clustering the data, then embedding each cluster, and finally aligning
the clusters to obtain a global embedding. We demonstrate this approach on
several synthetic and real-world datasets and show that it is competitive with
existing methods, while being much more transparent.

Conclusion: 图神经网络方法在脓毒症治疗决策支持中显示出良好前景，但表示学习仍面临挑战，需要进一步研究来优化患者状态表示的质量和效果。

Abstract: Sepsis is a serious, life-threatening condition. When treating sepsis, it is
challenging to determine the correct amount of intravenous fluids and
vasopressors for a given patient. While automated reinforcement learning
(RL)-based methods have been used to support these decisions with promising
results, previous studies have relied on relational data. Given the complexity
of modern healthcare data, representing data as a graph may provide a more
natural and effective approach. This study models patient data from the
well-known MIMIC-III dataset as a heterogeneous graph that evolves over time.
Subsequently, we explore two Graph Neural Network architectures - GraphSAGE and
GATv2 - for learning patient state representations, adopting the approach of
decoupling representation learning from policy learning. The encoders are
trained to produce latent state representations, jointly with decoders that
predict the next patient state. These representations are then used for policy
learning with the dBCQ algorithm. The results of our experimental evaluation
confirm the potential of a graph-based approach, while highlighting the
complexity of representation learning in this domain.

Motivation: 现有RLVR方法中，结果奖励模型过于粗粒度无法区分正确答案中的错误推理或错误答案中的有效推理，而过程奖励模型虽然细粒度但存在不准确和奖励攻击问题

Method: 提出PROF方法，通过一致性驱动的样本选择策略，保留过程奖励值较高的正确响应和过程奖励值较低的错误响应，同时保持正负样本平衡

Result: 实验表明该方法相比混合方法持续提升最终准确率超过4%，同时增强了中间推理步骤的质量

Conclusion: PROF有效解决了过程奖励和结果奖励之间的协调问题，为数学推理任务提供了更优的强化学习方案

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged to be a
predominant paradigm for mathematical reasoning tasks, offering stable
improvements in reasoning ability. However, Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) in
RLVR are too coarse-grained to distinguish flawed reasoning within correct
answers or valid reasoning within incorrect answers. This lack of granularity
introduces noisy and misleading gradients significantly and hinders further
progress in reasoning process quality. While Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer
fine-grained guidance for intermediate steps, they frequently suffer from
inaccuracies and are susceptible to reward hacking.
  To resolve this dilemma, we introduce PRocess cOnsistency Filter (PROF), an
effective data process curation method that harmonizes noisy, fine-grained
process rewards with accurate, coarse-grained outcome rewards. Rather than
naively blending PRM and ORM in the objective function
(arXiv:archive/2506.18896), PROF leverages their complementary strengths
through consistency-driven sample selection. Our approach retains correct
responses with higher averaged process values and incorrect responses with
lower averaged process values, while maintaining positive/negative training
sample balance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only
consistently improves the final accuracy over $4\%$ compared to the blending
approaches, but also strengthens the quality of intermediate reasoning steps.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are a recently introduced neural
architecture that replace fixed nonlinearities with trainable activation
functions, offering enhanced flexibility and interpretability. While KANs have
been applied successfully across scientific and machine learning tasks, their
initialization strategies remain largely unexplored. In this work, we study
initialization schemes for spline-based KANs, proposing two theory-driven
approaches inspired by LeCun and Glorot, as well as an empirical power-law
family with tunable exponents. Our evaluation combines large-scale grid
searches on function fitting and forward PDE benchmarks, an analysis of
training dynamics through the lens of the Neural Tangent Kernel, and
evaluations on a subset of the Feynman dataset. Our findings indicate that the
Glorot-inspired initialization significantly outperforms the baseline in
parameter-rich models, while power-law initialization achieves the strongest
performance overall, both across tasks and for architectures of varying size.

Conclusion: LINKER仅需序列级输入即可实现大规模应用，特别适用于结构数据不可用的情况，为分子识别和理性药物设计提供了新工具

Abstract: Accurate identification of interactions between protein residues and ligand
functional groups is essential to understand molecular recognition and guide
rational drug design. Existing deep learning approaches for protein-ligand
interpretability often rely on 3D structural input or use distance-based
contact labels, limiting both their applicability and biological relevance. We
introduce LINKER, the first sequence-based model to predict residue-functional
group interactions in terms of biologically defined interaction types, using
only protein sequences and the ligand SMILES as input. LINKER is trained with
structure-supervised attention, where interaction labels are derived from 3D
protein-ligand complexes via functional group-based motif extraction. By
abstracting ligand structures into functional groups, the model focuses on
chemically meaningful substructures while predicting interaction types rather
than mere spatial proximity. Crucially, LINKER requires only sequence-level
input at inference time, enabling large-scale application in settings where
structural data is unavailable. Experiments on the LP-PDBBind benchmark
demonstrate that structure-informed supervision over functional group
abstractions yields interaction predictions closely aligned with ground-truth
biochemical annotations.

Abstract: Simulating particle dynamics with high fidelity is crucial for solving
real-world interaction and control tasks involving liquids in design, graphics,
and robotics. Recently, data-driven approaches, particularly those based on
graph neural networks (GNNs), have shown progress in tackling such problems.
However, these approaches are often limited to learning fluid behavior in
static free-fall environments or simple manipulation settings involving
primitive objects, often overlooking complex interactions with dynamically
moving kinematic rigid bodies. Here, we propose a GNN-based framework designed
from the ground up to learn the dynamics of liquids under rigid body
interactions and active manipulations, where particles are represented as graph
nodes and particle-object collisions are handled using surface representations
with the bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) algorithm. This approach enables the
network to model complex interactions between liquid particles and intricate
surface geometries. Our model accurately captures fluid behavior in dynamic
settings and can also function as a simulator in static free-fall environments.
Despite being trained on a single-object manipulation task of pouring, our
model generalizes effectively to environments with unseen objects and novel
manipulation tasks such as stirring and scooping. Finally, we show that the
learned dynamics can be leveraged to solve control and manipulation tasks using
gradient-based optimization methods.

Motivation: 量化可以大幅减少训练时间、能耗和成本，但在差分隐私SGD中会导致显著的精度下降，因为噪声注入放大了量化方差

Method: 提出QPQuant动态量化框架：1）概率性采样轮换量化层；2）使用差分隐私损失敏感度估计器进行损失感知层优先级排序，识别对模型质量影响最小的可量化层

Conclusion: QPQuant有效解决了DP-SGD中量化导致的精度下降问题，在保持差分隐私保护的同时显著提升了低精度硬件上的训练效率

Abstract: Differentially-Private SGD (DP-SGD) is a powerful technique to protect user
privacy when using sensitive data to train neural networks. During training,
converting model weights and activations into low-precision formats, i.e.,
quantization, can drastically reduce training times, energy consumption, and
cost, and is thus a widely used technique. In this work, we demonstrate that
quantization causes significantly higher accuracy degradation in DP-SGD
compared to regular SGD. We observe that this is caused by noise injection in
DP-SGD, which amplifies quantization variance, leading to disproportionately
large accuracy degradation. To address this challenge, we present QPQuant, a
dynamic quantization framework that adaptively selects a changing subset of
layers to quantize at each epoch. Our method combines two key ideas that
effectively reduce quantization variance: (i) probabilistic sampling of the
layers that rotates which layers are quantized every epoch, and (ii) loss-aware
layer prioritization, which uses a differentially private loss sensitivity
estimator to identify layers that can be quantized with minimal impact on model
quality. This estimator consumes a negligible fraction of the overall privacy
budget, preserving DP guarantees. Empirical evaluations on ResNet18, ResNet50,
and DenseNet121 across a range of datasets demonstrate that DPQuant
consistently outperforms static quantization baselines, achieving near
Pareto-optimal accuracy-compute trade-offs and up to 2.21x theoretical
throughput improvements on low-precision hardware, with less than 2% drop in
validation accuracy.

Motivation: 为之前提出的TwF方法提供严格的理论基础，证明其在顺序训练中能够精确保持已学习样本的端点映射，而不仅仅是一阶近似意义上的保持。

Method: 通过数学分析证明在非奇异控制条件下，TwF方法中的参数子空间构成有限余维的Banach子流形，并详细刻画该子流形的切空间结构。

Result: 证明了TwF对应的参数子空间确实是一个Banach子流形，其切空间特性确保了控制函数沿着该子流形切空间的连续变形能够精确保持端点映射。

Conclusion: 该研究为TwF方法提供了坚实的数学理论基础，表明该方法能够在顺序训练过程中精确实现"不遗忘"的特性，超越了之前的一阶近似理解。

Abstract: In our earlier work, we introduced the principle of Tuning without Forgetting
(TwF) for sequential training of neural ODEs, where training samples are added
iteratively and parameters are updated within the subspace of control functions
that preserves the end-point mapping at previously learned samples on the
manifold of output labels in the first-order approximation sense. In this
letter, we prove that this parameter subspace forms a Banach submanifold of
finite codimension under nonsingular controls, and we characterize its tangent
space. This reveals that TwF corresponds to a continuation/deformation of the
control function along the tangent space of this Banach submanifold, providing
a theoretical foundation for its mapping-preserving (not forgetting) during the
sequential training exactly, beyond first-order approximation.

Abstract: Proteins play crucial roles in almost all biological processes. The
advancement of deep learning has greatly accelerated the development of protein
foundation models, leading to significant successes in protein understanding
and design. However, the lack of systematic red-teaming for these models has
raised serious concerns about their potential misuse, such as generating
proteins with biological safety risks. This paper introduces SafeProtein, the
first red-teaming framework designed for protein foundation models to the best
of our knowledge. SafeProtein combines multimodal prompt engineering and
heuristic beam search to systematically design red-teaming methods and conduct
tests on protein foundation models. We also curated SafeProtein-Bench, which
includes a manually constructed red-teaming benchmark dataset and a
comprehensive evaluation protocol. SafeProtein achieved continuous jailbreaks
on state-of-the-art protein foundation models (up to 70% attack success rate
for ESM3), revealing potential biological safety risks in current protein
foundation models and providing insights for the development of robust security
protection technologies for frontier models. The codes will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/jigang-fan/SafeProtein.

### [153] [On Entropy Control in LLM-RL Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03493)
*Han Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文针对LLM-RL训练中传统熵正则化效果不佳的问题，提出了AEnt方法，通过钳制熵奖励和自动调整系数来改进熵控制，在数学推理任务中表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统熵正则化在机器人控制和游戏RL中有效，但在LLM-RL训练中效果不佳，主要原因是LLM响应空间极大且最优输出稀疏。

Method: 提出AEnt方法：使用钳制熵奖励（在较小的标记空间上重新归一化策略计算）和自动调整的熵系数，鼓励在更紧凑的响应集中探索。

Result: 在多个基础模型和数据集上的数学推理任务测试中，AEnt方法始终优于基线方法。

Conclusion: AEnt通过改进熵控制机制，有效解决了LLM-RL训练中的熵正则化问题，为LLM强化学习提供了更好的熵管理方案。

Abstract: For RL algorithms, appropriate entropy control is crucial to their
effectiveness. To control the policy entropy, a commonly used method is entropy
regularization, which is adopted in various popular RL algorithms including
PPO, SAC and A3C. Although entropy regularization proves effective in robotic
and games RL conventionally, studies found that it gives weak to no gains in
LLM-RL training. In this work, we study the issues of entropy bonus in LLM-RL
setting. Specifically, we first argue that the conventional entropy
regularization suffers from the LLM's extremely large response space and the
sparsity of the optimal outputs. As a remedy, we propose AEnt, an entropy
control method that utilizes a new clamped entropy bonus with an automatically
adjusted coefficient. The clamped entropy is evaluated with the re-normalized
policy defined on certain smaller token space, which encourages exploration
within a more compact response set. In addition, the algorithm automatically
adjusts entropy coefficient according to the clamped entropy value, effectively
controlling the entropy-induced bias while leveraging the entropy's benefits.
AEnt is tested in math-reasoning tasks under different base models and
datasets, and it is observed that AEnt outperforms the baselines consistently
across multiple benchmarks.

Result: Sentinel-2的2D中值时间特征在所有迁移场景中表现出最强的稳定性；数据增强技术显著提高了模型鲁棒性，特别是在训练数据多样性有限时。

Conclusion: 研究发现了更具不变性的特征表示，增强了地理迁移能力，为在全球多样化区域实现可扩展、低成本的作物类型应用提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Accurately obtaining crop type and its spatial distribution at a global scale
is critical for food security, agricultural policy-making, and sustainable
development. Remote sensing offers an efficient solution for large-scale crop
classification, but the limited availability of reliable ground samples in many
regions constrains applicability across geographic areas. To address
performance declines under geospatial shifts, this study identifies remote
sensing features that are invariant to geographic variation and proposes
strategies to enhance cross-regional generalization. We construct CropGlobe, a
global crop type dataset with 300,000 pixel-level samples from eight countries
across five continents, covering six major food and industrial crops (corn,
soybeans, rice, wheat, sugarcane, cotton). With broad geographic coverage,
CropGlobe enables a systematic evaluation under cross-country, cross-continent,
and cross-hemisphere transfer. We compare the transferability of temporal
multi-spectral features (Sentinel-2-based 1D/2D median features and harmonic
coefficients) and hyperspectral features (from EMIT). To improve generalization
under spectral and phenological shifts, we design CropNet, a lightweight and
robust CNN tailored for pixel-level crop classification, coupled with temporal
data augmentation (time shift, time scale, and magnitude warping) that
simulates realistic cross-regional phenology. Experiments show that 2D median
temporal features from Sentinel-2 consistently exhibit the strongest invariance
across all transfer scenarios, and augmentation further improves robustness,
particularly when training data diversity is limited. Overall, the work
identifies more invariant feature representations that enhance geographic
transferability and suggests a promising path toward scalable, low-cost crop
type applications across globally diverse regions.

Motivation: 解决聚合学习中因内存和通信限制而被排除的边缘设备问题，让低资源客户端能够参与模型训练，减少系统偏差和提高数据可用性。

Method: 设计ZOWarmUp算法，结合零阶法(MeZO)和方差减少技术，允许从随机初始化进行零阶训练，只需传输小量随机种子而非全部梯度。

Result: 在多种数据集和模型架构上进行实验，证明ZOWarmUp是一个健壮的算法，能够在各种情况下应用，提供更大的数据量和多样性。

Conclusion: ZOWarmUp算法有效解决了聚合学习中边缘设备的资源限制问题，通过零阶优化方法让更多低资源客户端参与训练，显著提高了训练效果和数据利用率。

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across numerous edge
devices without requiring participants to share data; however, memory and
communication constraints on these edge devices may preclude their
participation in training. We consider a setting in which a subset of edge
devices are below a critical memory or communication threshold required to
conduct model updates. Under typical federated optimization algorithms, these
devices are excluded from training which renders their data inaccessible and
increases system induced bias. We are inspired by MeZO, a zeroth-order method
used for memory-efficient fine-tuning. The increased variance inherent to
zeroth-order gradient approximations has relegated previous zeroth-order
optimizers exclusively to the domain of fine tuning; a limitation we seek to
correct. We devise a federated, memory-efficient zeroth-order optimizer,
ZOWarmUp that permits zeroth-order training from a random initialization.
ZOWarmUp leverages differing client capabilities and careful variance reduction
techniques to facilitate participation of under-represented, low-resource
clients in model training. Like other federated zeroth-order methods, ZOWarmUp
eliminates the need for edge devices to transmit their full gradients to the
server and instead relies on only a small set of random seeds, rendering the
up-link communication cost negligible. We present experiments using various
datasets and model architectures to show that ZOWarmUp is a robust algorithm
that can can be applied under a wide variety of circumstances. For systems with
a high proportion of edge devices that would otherwise be excluded from
training, this algorithm provides access to a greater volume and diversity of
data, thus improving training outcomes.

Conclusion: 这项研究为AI伦理讨论做出了贡献，揭示了LLM在高风险环境中部署的风险和潜在防护措施。研究结果显示了开发可靠AI系统的重要性和复杂性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
a variety of tasks, but their increasing autonomy in real-world applications
raises concerns about their trustworthiness. While hallucinations-unintentional
falsehoods-have been widely studied, the phenomenon of lying, where an LLM
knowingly generates falsehoods to achieve an ulterior objective, remains
underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the lying behavior
of LLMs, differentiating it from hallucinations and testing it in practical
scenarios. Through mechanistic interpretability techniques, we uncover the
neural mechanisms underlying deception, employing logit lens analysis, causal
interventions, and contrastive activation steering to identify and control
deceptive behavior. We study real-world lying scenarios and introduce
behavioral steering vectors that enable fine-grained manipulation of lying
tendencies. Further, we explore the trade-offs between lying and end-task
performance, establishing a Pareto frontier where dishonesty can enhance goal
optimization. Our findings contribute to the broader discourse on AI ethics,
shedding light on the risks and potential safeguards for deploying LLMs in
high-stakes environments. Code and more illustrations are available at

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于效应性测量的梯度方法，解决决策依赖游戏中数据分布变化导致的复杂动态问题，并保证收敛到性能稳定均衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖于对数据分布地图的Lipschitz连续性假设，而这在实际中通常是未知的，导致方法不可行。需要一种不依赖于这些假设的实用方法来解决决策依赖游戏中的性能稳定均衡问题。

Method: 提出了一种梯度基于的效应性测量方法，直接量化决策导致的分布变化影响。在强单调性假设下，提出了一种效应性信息重复重训练算法，根据效应性测量调整玩家损失函数。

Result: 在预测错误最小化游戏、古诺竞争和收益最大化游戏中进行实验，结果显示该方法在损失值和收敛速度方面都超过了现有最优基线方法。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种实用的方法来解决决策依赖游戏中的性能稳定均衡问题，方法不依赖于对数据分布地图的前知假设，并且在多个应用场景中都表现出优异的性能。

Abstract: In decision-dependent games, multiple players optimize their decisions under
a data distribution that shifts with their joint actions, creating complex
dynamics in applications like market pricing. A practical consequence of these
dynamics is the \textit{performatively stable equilibrium}, where each player's
strategy is a best response under the induced distribution. Prior work relies
on $\beta$-smoothness, assuming Lipschitz continuity of loss function gradients
with respect to the data distribution, which is impractical as the data
distribution maps, i.e., the relationship between joint decision and the
resulting distribution shifts, are typically unknown, rendering $\beta$
unobtainable. To overcome this limitation, we propose a gradient-based
sensitivity measure that directly quantifies the impact of decision-induced
distribution shifts. Leveraging this measure, we derive convergence guarantees
for performatively stable equilibria under a practically feasible assumption of
strong monotonicity. Accordingly, we develop a sensitivity-informed repeated
retraining algorithm that adjusts players' loss functions based on the
sensitivity measure, guaranteeing convergence to performatively stable
equilibria for arbitrary data distribution maps. Experiments on prediction
error minimization game, Cournot competition, and revenue maximization game
show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving lower
losses and faster convergence.

Motivation: 扩散模型在自动出价中面临生成不确定性挑战，特别是相邻状态间的动态合法性不足，导致在竞争激烈的拍卖环境中错失广告展示机会

Method: 1) 引入额外随机变量t增强扩散训练，观察t长度历史序列并补全剩余序列；2) 使用轨迹级回报模型精炼生成轨迹，更好对齐广告主目标

Result: 在大规模自动出价基准上表现优异，稀疏奖励拍卖设置中转化价值提升29.9%；在快手在线广告平台实现目标成本2.0%的提升

Conclusion: CBD方法有效解决了扩散模型在自动出价中的生成不确定性问题，通过补全对齐框架显著提升了竞拍性能和商业效果

Abstract: Auto-bidding is central to computational advertising, achieving notable
commercial success by optimizing advertisers' bids within economic constraints.
Recently, large generative models show potential to revolutionize auto-bidding
by generating bids that could flexibly adapt to complex, competitive
environments. Among them, diffusers stand out for their ability to address
sparse-reward challenges by focusing on trajectory-level accumulated rewards,
as well as their explainable capability, i.e., planning a future trajectory of
states and executing bids accordingly. However, diffusers struggle with
generation uncertainty, particularly regarding dynamic legitimacy between
adjacent states, which can lead to poor bids and further cause significant loss
of ad impression opportunities when competing with other advertisers in a
highly competitive auction environment. To address it, we propose a Causal
auto-Bidding method based on a Diffusion completer-aligner framework, termed
CBD. Firstly, we augment the diffusion training process with an extra random
variable t, where the model observes t-length historical sequences with the
goal of completing the remaining sequence, thereby enhancing the generated
sequences' dynamic legitimacy. Then, we employ a trajectory-level return model
to refine the generated trajectories, aligning more closely with advertisers'
objectives. Experimental results across diverse settings demonstrate that our
approach not only achieves superior performance on large-scale auto-bidding
benchmarks, such as a 29.9% improvement in conversion value in the challenging
sparse-reward auction setting, but also delivers significant improvements on
the Kuaishou online advertising platform, including a 2.0% increase in target
cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标注数据（输入-输出关联）和未标注数据（更广泛的上下文基础）在检索增强生成中具有互补优势，但两者相似性分数不可直接比较，需要有效整合

Method: 首先使用标准排序融合技术分别聚合多个IR模型的top文档，然后对每个来源的检索分数分布进行z-score标准化，最后合并两个来源的top检索文档

Result: 该方法在事实验证任务上持续优于最佳单排序器或单来源方法，并展现出更好的跨域泛化能力

Conclusion: 通过标准化不同来源的检索分数分布来融合异构数据源，能够有效提升RAG系统的性能和泛化能力

Abstract: Leveraging both labeled (input-output associations) and unlabeled data (wider
contextual grounding) may provide complementary benefits in retrieval augmented
generation (RAG). However, effectively combining evidence from these
heterogeneous sources is challenging as the respective similarity scores are
not inter-comparable. Additionally, aggregating beliefs from the outputs of
multiple rankers can improve the effectiveness of RAG. Our proposed method
first aggregates the top-documents from a number of IR models using a standard
rank fusion technique for each source (labeled and unlabeled). Next, we
standardize the retrieval score distributions within each source by applying
z-score transformation before merging the top-retrieved documents from the two
sources. We evaluate our approach on the fact verification task, demonstrating
that it consistently improves over the best-performing individual ranker or
source and also shows better out-of-domain generalization.

Abstract: Modern e-commerce platforms strive to enhance customer experience by
providing timely and contextually relevant recommendations. However,
recommending general merchandise to customers focused on grocery shopping --
such as pairing milk with a milk frother -- remains a critical yet
under-explored challenge. This paper introduces a cross-pollination (XP)
framework, a novel approach that bridges grocery and general merchandise
cross-category recommendations by leveraging multi-source product associations
and real-time cart context. Our solution employs a two-stage framework: (1) A
candidate generation mechanism that uses co-purchase market basket analysis and
LLM-based approach to identify novel item-item associations; and (2) a
transformer-based ranker that leverages the real-time sequential cart context
and optimizes for engagement signals such as add-to-carts. Offline analysis and
online A/B tests show an increase of 36\% add-to-cart rate with LLM-based
retrieval, and 27\% NDCG\@4 lift using cart context-based ranker. Our work
contributes practical techniques for cross-category recommendations and broader

Abstract: Cross-domain recommendation systems face the challenge of integrating
fine-grained user and item relationships across various product domains. To
address this, we introduce RankGraph, a scalable graph learning framework
designed to serve as a core component in recommendation foundation models
(FMs). By constructing and leveraging graphs composed of heterogeneous nodes

complex relationships between users, posts, ads, and other entities. Our
framework employs a GPU-accelerated Graph Neural Network and contrastive
learning, allowing for dynamic extraction of subgraphs such as item-item and
user-user graphs to support similarity-based retrieval and real-time
clustering. Furthermore, RankGraph integrates graph-based pretrained
representations as contextual tokens into FM sequence models, enriching them
with structured relational knowledge. RankGraph has demonstrated improvements
in click (+0.92%) and conversion rates (+2.82%) in online A/B tests, showcasing
its effectiveness in cross-domain recommendation scenarios.

feature extraction, achieves fine-grained modality fusion through multi-head
cross-attention, and propagates higher-order adjacency information via graph

Conclusion: RVRec作为一种模型无关的嵌入增强方法，有效解决了推荐系统中嵌入代表性和价值评估的问题，为提升推荐系统的性能和可解释性提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Existing multimedia recommender systems provide users with suggestions of
media by evaluating the similarities, such as games and movies. To enhance the
semantics and explainability of embeddings, it is a consensus to apply
additional information (e.g., interactions, contexts, popularity). However,
without systematic consideration of representativeness and value, the utility
and explainability of embedding drops drastically. Hence, we introduce RVRec, a
plug-and-play model-agnostic embedding enhancement approach that can improve
both personality and explainability of existing systems. Specifically, we
propose a probability-based embedding optimization method that uses a
contrastive loss based on negative 2-Wasserstein distance to learn to enhance
the representativeness of the embeddings. In addtion, we introduce a reweighing
method based on multivariate Shapley values strategy to evaluate and explore
the value of interactions and embeddings. Extensive experiments on multiple
backbone recommenders and real-world datasets show that RVRec can improve the
personalization and explainability of existing recommenders, outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: RecBase通过推荐特定的预训练和统一项目表示，有效提升了跨域推荐性能，证明了推荐导向预训练的重要性。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLM-based recommendation have shown promise, yet their
cross-domain generalization is hindered by a fundamental mismatch between
language-centric pretraining and the recommendation task. Existing methods,
relying on language-level knowledge, fail to capture dynamic, item-level user
interests across domains. To bridge this gap, we propose RecBase, a
domain-agnostic foundational model pretrained with a recommendation-oriented
objective. RecBase leverages a large-scale, heterogeneous, cross-domain corpus
with unified textual representations and feature mappings to enhance
cross-domain generalization. To further align item semantics across domains, we
introduce a unified item tokenizer that encodes items into hierarchical concept
identifiers, enabling structured representation and efficient vocabulary
sharing. The model is trained using an autoregressive objective to capture
complex item-level sequential patterns. On eight real-world datasets, our
1.5B-parameter model matches or surpasses the performance of LLM baselines up
to 7B parameters in zero-shot and cross-domain recommendation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建模神经网络输出与数值特征之间的单调性对于推荐系统的可解释性和有效性至关重要

Method: 两阶段过程：合成反事实样本 + 对比反事实样本，形成端到端的模型无关训练框架

Result: 在公开数据集和真实工业数据集上的大量实验证明了CCSS的有效性，已在工业推荐系统中部署并服务数亿用户

Conclusion: CCSS成功解决了推荐系统中数值特征单调性建模的问题，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: We propose a general model-agnostic Contrastive learning framework with
Counterfactual Samples Synthesizing (CCSS) for modeling the monotonicity
between the neural network output and numerical features which is critical for
interpretability and effectiveness of recommender systems. CCSS models the
monotonicity via a two-stage process: synthesizing counterfactual samples and
contrasting the counterfactual samples. The two techniques are naturally
integrated into a model-agnostic framework, forming an end-to-end training
process. Abundant empirical tests are conducted on a publicly available dataset
and a real industrial dataset, and the results well demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed CCSS. Besides, CCSS has been deployed in our real
large-scale industrial recommender, successfully serving over hundreds of
millions users.

TL;DR: OneSearch是首个工业级端到端生成式电商搜索框架，通过三项关键创新解决了传统多阶段级联架构的碎片化计算和优化目标冲突问题，在快手多个搜索场景成功部署，显著提升了点击率、购买转化和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统电商搜索系统采用多阶段级联架构，虽然能在计算效率和商业转化之间取得平衡，但存在碎片化计算和各阶段优化目标冲突的问题，限制了性能上限。

Method: 提出OneSearch框架，包含三个核心创新：1）关键词增强的分层量化编码模块（KHQE）保持分层语义和商品属性；2）多视图用户行为序列注入策略构建行为驱动用户ID；3）偏好感知奖励系统（PARS）进行多阶段监督微调和自适应奖励加权排序。

Result: 大规模行业数据集离线评估显示OneSearch在高质量召回和排序方面表现优异。在线A/B测试证实：在相同曝光位置下，商品点击率提升1.67%，买家数提升2.40%，订单量提升3.22%，运营支出减少75.40%，模型FLOPs利用率从3.26%提升至27.32%。

Conclusion: OneSearch成功解决了传统电商搜索系统的局限性，实现了端到端的生成式搜索框架，在提升业务指标的同时显著降低了计算成本，已在快手多个搜索场景为数百万用户提供服务。

Abstract: Traditional e-commerce search systems employ multi-stage cascading
architectures (MCA) that progressively filter items through recall,
pre-ranking, and ranking stages. While effective at balancing computational
efficiency with business conversion, these systems suffer from fragmented
computation and optimization objective collisions across stages, which
ultimately limit their performance ceiling. To address these, we propose
\textbf{OneSearch}, the first industrial-deployed end-to-end generative
framework for e-commerce search. This framework introduces three key
innovations: (1) a Keyword-enhanced Hierarchical Quantization Encoding (KHQE)
module, to preserve both hierarchical semantics and distinctive item attributes
while maintaining strong query-item relevance constraints; (2) a multi-view
user behavior sequence injection strategy that constructs behavior-driven user
IDs and incorporates both explicit short-term and implicit long-term sequences
to model user preferences comprehensively; and (3) a Preference-Aware Reward
System (PARS) featuring multi-stage supervised fine-tuning and adaptive
reward-weighted ranking to capture fine-grained user preferences. Extensive
offline evaluations on large-scale industry datasets demonstrate OneSearch's
superior performance for high-quality recall and ranking. The rigorous online
A/B tests confirm its ability to enhance relevance in the same exposure
position, achieving statistically significant improvements: +1.67\% item CTR,
+2.40\% buyer, and +3.22\% order volume. Furthermore, OneSearch reduces
operational expenditure by 75.40\% and improves Model FLOPs Utilization from
3.26\% to 27.32\%. The system has been successfully deployed across multiple
search scenarios in Kuaishou, serving millions of users, generating tens of
millions of PVs daily.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于二维同质旋转立方体模块化机器人自主重构的分散式模型，使用局部信息感知的神经网络和强化学习训练，通过几何深度学习融入网格对称性，实现了近乎最优的重构性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个分散式的控制系统，使模块化机器人能够仅通过局部邻居信息实现自主重构，提高系统的可扩展性和鲁棒性。

Method: 每个立方体模块配备神经网络控制器，仅从局部邻居获取信息，使用强化学习训练，并采用几何深度学习方法来融入网格对称性。通过多次信息传递积累全局信息。

Result: 即使是最局部化的版本也能成功重构到目标形状，重构速度随可用信息量增加而提高。仅使用最近邻交互就能实现近乎最优的重构性能。几何深度学习方法相比标准架构优势有限。

Conclusion: 成功展示了模块自组装系统的局部控制方法，该方法可迁移到其他空间相关系统，如滑动立方体模块化机器人和立方星群。

Abstract: We present a decentralized model for autonomous reconfiguration of
homogeneous pivoting cube modular robots in two dimensions. Each cube in the
ensemble is controlled by a neural network that only gains information from
other cubes in its local neighborhood, trained using reinforcement learning.
Furthermore, using geometric deep learning, we include the grid symmetries of
the cube ensemble in the neural network architecture. We find that even the
most localized versions succeed in reconfiguring to the target shape, although
reconfiguration happens faster the more information about the whole ensemble is
available to individual cubes. Near-optimal reconfiguration is achieved with
only nearest neighbor interactions by using multiple information passing
between cubes, allowing them to accumulate more global information about the
ensemble. Compared to standard neural network architectures, using geometric
deep learning approaches provided only minor benefits. Overall, we successfully
demonstrate mostly local control of a modular self-assembling system, which is
transferable to other space-relevant systems with different action spaces, such
as sliding cube modular robots and CubeSat swarms.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了动态门控神经元(DGN)，通过引入生物神经元中的动态电导机制来增强脉冲神经网络的鲁棒性和噪声抑制能力，相比传统LIF神经元在抗噪声和时间相关任务上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LIF神经元模型过于简化，忽略了生物神经元中动态电导机制，限制了SNN处理噪声和时间变化的能力。作者希望从功能角度重新审视动态电导，将其作为生物合理的门控机制来调节信息流。

Method: 引入动态门控神经元(DGN)，其膜电导会根据神经元活动动态演化，实现选择性输入滤波和自适应噪声抑制。提供了理论分析证明DGN相比标准LIF模型具有增强的随机稳定性。

Result: 基于DGN的SNN在抗噪声任务和时间相关基准测试(TIDIGITS和SHD)上表现出卓越性能， consistently展现出优秀的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次证明了生物合理的动态门控是稳健脉冲计算的关键机制，为更弹性、高效和生物启发的脉冲神经网络铺平了道路。

Abstract: While spiking neural networks (SNNs) provide a biologically inspired and
energy-efficient computational framework, their robustness and the dynamic
advantages inherent to biological neurons remain significantly underutilized
owing to oversimplified neuron models. In particular, conventional leaky
integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons often omit the dynamic conductance mechanisms
inherent in biological neurons, thereby limiting their capacity to cope with
noise and temporal variability. In this work, we revisit dynamic conductance
from a functional perspective and uncover its intrinsic role as a biologically
plausible gating mechanism that modulates information flow. Building on this
insight, we introduce the Dynamic Gated Neuron~(DGN), a novel spiking unit in
which membrane conductance evolves in response to neuronal activity, enabling
selective input filtering and adaptive noise suppression. We provide a
theoretical analysis showing that DGN possess enhanced stochastic stability
compared to standard LIF models, with dynamic conductance intriguingly acting
as a disturbance rejection mechanism. DGN-based SNNs demonstrate superior
performance across extensive evaluations on anti-noise tasks and
temporal-related benchmarks such as TIDIGITS and SHD, consistently exhibiting
excellent robustness. Our results highlight, for the first time, a biologically
plausible dynamic gating as a key mechanism for robust spike-based computation,
providing not only theoretical guarantees but also strong empirical
validations. This work thus paves the way for more resilient, efficient, and
biologically inspired spiking neural networks.

Motivation: 为了在连续空间场中统一符号计算、物理模拟和感知推理，提供一个可微的计算框架来桥接离散算法和连续场动力学

Method: 结合神经控制器、连续记忆场和可移动读写头，在每个时间步读取局部补丁，通过学习规则计算更新并写回，同时更新头部位置

Result: 成功实现了三种实例：元胞自动机模拟（Rule 110）、物理信息PDE求解器（2D热方程）和迭代图像细化（CIFAR-10修复），展示了稳定的长时程推演和训练范围外的泛化能力

Conclusion: NFTM提供了一个统一的计算基板，在单个可微框架内桥接了离散算法和连续场动力学

Abstract: We introduce the Neural Field Turing Machine (NFTM), a differentiable
architecture that unifies symbolic computation, physical simulation, and
perceptual inference within continuous spatial fields. NFTM combines a neural
controller, continuous memory field, and movable read/write heads that perform
local updates. At each timestep, the controller reads local patches, computes
updates via learned rules, and writes them back while updating head positions.
This design achieves linear O(N) scaling through fixed-radius neighborhoods
while maintaining Turing completeness under bounded error. We demonstrate three
example instantiations of NFTM: cellular automata simulation (Rule 110),
physics-informed PDE solvers (2D heat equation), and iterative image refinement
(CIFAR-10 inpainting). These instantiations learn local update rules that
compose into global dynamics, exhibit stable long-horizon rollouts, and
generalize beyond training horizons. NFTM provides a unified computational
substrate bridging discrete algorithms and continuous field dynamics within a
single differentiable framework.

TL;DR: 程序员在利润与安全问题上更偏向选择利润，需要媒体报道来形成负面后果。研究通过游戏理论模型发现，媒体报道能促进AI安全合作，但需要信息质量高和成本控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因为AI开发者经常在利润与用户安全之间选择利润，需要找到有效的相关机制来促使开发者重视安全问题，以便AI技术的普遍采用。

Method: 使用进化游戏理论建立模型，创建了自利的创造者和用户的人工群体，研究媒体报道对于促进合作的影响。

Result: 媒体能够促进创造者与用户之间的合作，但需要满足两个条件：媒体信息的质量充分可靠，以及访问媒体或确保安全的成本不能过高。否则合作无法形成。

Conclusion: 媒体通过形成公众意见和让开发者承担责任，可以成为一种强大的软性监管机制，在没有政府正式监管的情况下也能指导AI安全发展。

Abstract: When developers of artificial intelligence (AI) products need to decide
between profit and safety for the users, they likely choose profit.
Untrustworthy AI technology must come packaged with tangible negative
consequences. Here, we envisage those consequences as the loss of reputation
caused by media coverage of their misdeeds, disseminated to the public. We
explore whether media coverage has the potential to push AI creators into the
production of safe products, enabling widespread adoption of AI technology. We
created artificial populations of self-interested creators and users and
studied them through the lens of evolutionary game theory. Our results reveal
that media is indeed able to foster cooperation between creators and users, but
not always. Cooperation does not evolve if the quality of the information
provided by the media is not reliable enough, or if the costs of either
accessing media or ensuring safety are too high. By shaping public perception
and holding developers accountable, media emerges as a powerful soft regulator
-- guiding AI safety even in the absence of formal government oversight.

which was held in March 2025 with the goal of understanding how the MPS domains
(Astronomy, Chemistry, Materials Research, Mathematical Sciences, and Physics)
can best capitalize on, and contribute to, the future of AI. We present here a
summary and snapshot of the MPS community's perspective, as of Spring/Summer
2025, in a rapidly developing field. The link between AI and MPS is becoming
increasingly inextricable; now is a crucial moment to strengthen the link
between AI and Science by pursuing a strategy that proactively and thoughtfully
leverages the potential of AI for scientific discovery and optimizes
opportunities to impact the development of AI by applying concepts from
fundamental science. To achieve this, we propose activities and strategic
priorities that: (1) enable AI+MPS research in both directions; (2) build up an
interdisciplinary community of AI+MPS researchers; and (3) foster education and
workforce development in AI for MPS researchers and students. We conclude with
a summary of suggested priorities for funding agencies, educational
institutions, and individual researchers to help position the MPS community to
be a leader in, and take full advantage of, the transformative potential of

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前高层次世界模型在语义和时间抽象方面的推理能力不足，需要开发能够理解动作语义和进行时序推理的模型

Method: 使用LLM自优化提取目标，学习动作策略和动态模型，通过系统1反应式解码和系统2基于成本最小化的反思式规划

Result: 在VPA基准测试和PlannerArena人工评估中达到SOTA，系统2比系统1Elo分数提升27%，在RoboVQA和WorldPrediction基准上也优于强VLM基线

Conclusion: VLWM通过语言建模和双系统规划框架，有效提升了世界模型的语义理解和规划能力，为高层次推理任务提供了有力工具

Abstract: Effective planning requires strong world models, but high-level world models
that can understand and reason about actions with semantic and temporal
abstraction remain largely underdeveloped. We introduce the Vision Language
World Model (VLWM), a foundation model trained for language-based world
modeling on natural videos. Given visual observations, the VLWM first infers
the overall goal achievements then predicts a trajectory composed of
interleaved actions and world state changes. Those targets are extracted by
iterative LLM Self-Refine conditioned on compressed future observations
represented by Tree of Captions. The VLWM learns both an action policy and a
dynamics model, which respectively facilitates reactive system-1 plan decoding
and reflective system-2 planning via cost minimization. The cost evaluates the
semantic distance between the hypothetical future states given by VLWM
roll-outs and the expected goal state, and is measured by a critic model that
we trained in a self-supervised manner. The VLWM achieves state-of-the-art
Visual Planning for Assistance (VPA) performance on both benchmark evaluations
and our proposed PlannerArena human evaluations, where system-2 improves the
Elo score by +27% upon system-1. The VLWM models also outperforms strong VLM
baselines on RoboVQA and WorldPrediction benchmark.

Motivation: 解决当前AI驱动数据分析中的两大挑战：语义运算符在大规模数据上执行成本高且不适合交互式分析，而深度研究系统缺乏查询计划优化导致执行效率低。

Method: 构建原型系统，使Deep Research代理能够编写和执行优化的语义运算符程序，结合了两种方法的优势。

Result: 在两个基础查询中，原型系统表现超过了手工编写的语义运算符程序和开放的深度研究系统。与标准深度研究代理相比，F1分数提高了1.95倍，成本和运行时间节省了最76.8%和72.7%。

Conclusion: 通过结合语义运算符的优化执行和深度研究系统的灵活性，可以实现更高效的AI驱动数据分析，为未来的交互式大规模数据分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With advances in large language models (LLMs), researchers are creating new
systems that can perform AI-driven analytics over large unstructured datasets.
Recent work has explored executing such analytics queries using semantic
operators -- a declarative set of AI-powered data transformations with natural
language specifications. However, even when optimized, these operators can be
expensive to execute on millions of records and their iterator execution
semantics make them ill-suited for interactive data analytics tasks. In another
line of work, Deep Research systems have demonstrated an ability to answer
natural language question(s) over large datasets. These systems use one or more
LLM agent(s) to plan their execution, process the dataset(s), and iteratively
refine their answer. However, these systems do not explicitly optimize their
query plans which can lead to poor plan execution. In order for AI-driven
analytics to excel, we need a runtime which combines the optimized execution of
semantic operators with the flexibility and more dynamic execution of Deep
Research systems. As a first step towards this vision, we build a prototype
which enables Deep Research agents to write and execute optimized semantic
operator programs. We evaluate our prototype and demonstrate that it can
outperform a handcrafted semantic operator program and open Deep Research
systems on two basic queries. Compared to a standard open Deep Research agent,
our prototype achieves up to 1.95x better F1-score. Furthermore, even if we
give the agent access to semantic operators as tools, our prototype still
achieves cost and runtime savings of up to 76.8% and 72.7% thanks to its
optimized execution.

Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在自主驾驶运动生成领域有着结构性相似性，但对哪些LLM模块真正可转移缺乏系统性理解

Method: 通过在Waymo Sim Agents基准测试上的广泛实验，评估五个关键LLM模块：标记化器设计、位置嵌入、预训练范式、训练后策略和测试时计算

Result: 经过适当适配后，这些模块能够显著提高自主驾驶运动生成的性能，在Sim Agents任务中取得了竞争力的结果

Conclusion: 研究确认了可有效转移的技术，分析了某些方法失败的原因，并讨论了自主驾驶场景下的特定适配需求

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have not only advanced
natural language processing but also inspired their application in domains with
structurally similar problems--most notably, autonomous driving motion
generation. Both domains involve autoregressive sequence modeling, token-based
representations, and context-aware decision making, making the transfer of LLM
components a natural and increasingly common practice. However, despite
promising early attempts, a systematic understanding of which LLM modules are
truly transferable remains lacking. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
evaluation of five key LLM modules--tokenizer design, positional embedding,
pre-training paradigms, post-training strategies, and test-time
computation--within the context of motion generation for autonomous driving.
Through extensive experiments on the Waymo Sim Agents benchmark, we demonstrate
that, when appropriately adapted, these modules can significantly improve
performance for autonomous driving motion generation. In addition, we identify
which techniques can be effectively transferred, analyze the potential reasons
for the failure of others, and discuss the specific adaptations needed for
autonomous driving scenarios. We evaluate our method on the Sim Agents task and
achieve competitive results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于LLM的任务计划和人类演示可能包含噪声动作、冗余导航和逻辑错误，这会降低策略质量，需要一种能够广泛泛化到各种错误类型的验证方法。

Method: 使用迭代验证框架：Judge LLM批评动作序列，Planner LLM应用修订，通过自然语言提示实现跨错误类型的泛化，包括无关动作、矛盾步骤和缺失步骤。

Result: 在TEACh数据集上达到90%召回率和100%精确度，96.5%的序列最多需要3次迭代收敛，同时改善了时间效率和空间动作组织。

Conclusion: 该方法将计划验证确立为LLM在空间规划和动作优化中的可靠能力，为具身AI的模仿学习提供了可扩展的高质量训练数据生成路径。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based task plans and corresponding human
demonstrations for embodied AI may be noisy, with unnecessary actions,
redundant navigation, and logical errors that reduce policy quality. We propose
an iterative verification framework in which a Judge LLM critiques action
sequences and a Planner LLM applies the revisions, yielding progressively
cleaner and more spatially coherent trajectories. Unlike rule-based approaches,
our method relies on natural language prompting, enabling broad generalization
across error types including irrelevant actions, contradictions, and missing
steps. On a set of manually annotated actions from the TEACh embodied AI
dataset, our framework achieves up to 90% recall and 100% precision across four
state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT o4-mini, DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5, LLaMA 4 Scout).
The refinement loop converges quickly, with 96.5% of sequences requiring at
most three iterations, while improving both temporal efficiency and spatial
action organization. Crucially, the method preserves human error-recovery
patterns rather than collapsing them, supporting future work on robust
corrective behavior. By establishing plan verification as a reliable LLM
capability for spatial planning and action refinement, we provide a scalable
path to higher-quality training data for imitation learning in embodied AI.

73.3% viability rate with 30% reaching perfect quality scores, while
open-weights models achieve 80.8% of closed-model performance when provided
structured environments. The open-source framework has been adopted by the
community, with over 3,000 applications generated to date. This work
demonstrates that scaling reliable AI agents requires scaling environments, not

Motivation: 现有选择超启发式主要关注从预定义集合中自适应选择低层启发式，而忽略了集合本身的组成和策略性变换的重要性

Method: 系统分析基于三个关键原则的变换：解接受准则、低层启发式重复使用、以及扰动强度（扰动性低层启发式影响解的比例）

Abstract: Cross-domain selection hyper-heuristics aim to distill decades of research on
problem-specific heuristic search algorithms into adaptable general-purpose
search strategies. In this respect, existing selection hyper-heuristics
primarily focus on an adaptive selection of low-level heuristics (LLHs) from a
predefined set. In contrast, we concentrate on the composition of this set and
its strategic transformations. We systematically analyze transformations based
on three key principles: solution acceptance, LLH repetitions, and perturbation
intensity, i.e., the proportion of a solution affected by a perturbative LLH.
We demonstrate the raw effects of our transformations on a trivial unbiased
random selection mechanism. With an appropriately constructed transformation,
this trivial method outperforms all available state-of-the-art hyper-heuristics
on three challenging real-world domains and finds 11 new best-known solutions.
The same method is competitive with the winner of the CHeSC competition,
commonly used as the standard cross-domain benchmark. Moreover, we accompany
several recent hyper-heuristics with such strategic transformations. Using this
approach, we outperform the current state-of-the-art methods on both the CHeSC
benchmark and real-world domains while often simplifying their designs.

*Blai Bonet,Hector Geffner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于采样计划泛化的符号学习方法，使用命中集算法而非SAT/ASP，能够处理百万级状态和数十万特征的大规模问题，解决了现有组合方法可扩展性不足的问题。

Conclusion: 提出的命中集算法为基础的符号学习方法解决了组合策略学习中的可扩展性问题，为大规模规划问题的策略学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Combinatorial methods for learning general policies that solve large
collections of planning problems have been recently developed. One of their
strengths, in relation to deep learning approaches, is that the resulting
policies can be understood and shown to be correct. A weakness is that the
methods do not scale up and learn only from small training instances and
feature pools that contain a few hundreds of states and features at most. In
this work, we propose a new symbolic method for learning policies based on the
generalization of sampled plans that ensures structural termination and hence
acyclicity. The proposed learning approach is not based on SAT/ASP, as previous
symbolic methods, but on a hitting set algorithm that can effectively handle
problems with millions of states, and pools with hundreds of thousands of
features. The formal properties of the approach are analyzed, and its
scalability is tested on a number of benchmarks.

Result: 实验证明该框架产生的自适应探索策略在多个MuJoCo环境中优于标准方法

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一个通用的自适应探索解决方案，能够有效处理复杂策略学习中的探索-利用平衡问题

Abstract: Adaptive exploration methods propose ways to learn complex policies via
alternating between exploration and exploitation. An important question for
such methods is to determine the appropriate moment to switch between
exploration and exploitation and vice versa. This is critical in domains that
require the learning of long and complex sequences of actions. In this work, we
present a generic adaptive exploration framework that employs uncertainty to
address this important issue in a principled manner. Our framework includes
previous adaptive exploration approaches as special cases. Moreover, we can
incorporate in our framework any uncertainty-measuring mechanism of choice, for
instance mechanisms used in intrinsic motivation or epistemic uncertainty-based
exploration methods. We experimentally demonstrate that our framework gives
rise to adaptive exploration strategies that outperform standard ones across
several MuJoCo environments.

Conclusion: 该账户性框架有助于浅化医疗AI系统中账户性的模糊性，为各参与者提供了明确的实施指南，促进合作共享的账户性机制。

Abstract: AI is transforming the healthcare domain and is increasingly helping
practitioners to make health-related decisions. Therefore, accountability
becomes a crucial concern for critical AI-driven decisions. Although regulatory
bodies, such as the EU commission, provide guidelines, they are highlevel and
focus on the ''what'' that should be done and less on the ''how'', creating a
knowledge gap for actors. Through an extensive analysis, we found that the term
accountability is perceived and dealt with in many different ways, depending on
the actor's expertise and domain of work. With increasing concerns about AI
accountability issues and the ambiguity around this term, this paper bridges
the gap between the ''what'' and ''how'' of AI accountability, specifically for
AI systems in healthcare. We do this by analysing the concept of
accountability, formulating an accountability framework, and providing a
three-tier structure for handling various accountability mechanisms. Our
accountability framework positions the regulations of healthcare AI systems and
the mechanisms adopted by the actors under a consistent accountability regime.
Moreover, the three-tier structure guides the actors of the healthcare AI
system to categorise the mechanisms based on their conduct. Through our
framework, we advocate that decision-making in healthcare AI holds shared
dependencies, where accountability should be dealt with jointly and should
foster collaborations. We highlight the role of explainability in instigating
communication and information sharing between the actors to further facilitate
the collaborative process.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了InAbHyD数据集来评估大语言模型在归纳和溯因推理方面的能力，发现LLMs在简单场景中能进行此类推理，但在复杂世界模型中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注演绎推理，而归纳和溯因推理在解决现实问题中同样重要但较少被探索，需要系统评估LLMs在这方面的能力。

Method: 创建可编程合成数据集InAbHyD，包含不完整世界模型和观察结果，要求智能体生成解释性假设，并基于奥卡姆剃刀原理提出新评估指标。

Result: LLMs在简单场景中能进行归纳和溯因推理，但在复杂世界模型中表现不佳，即使使用上下文学习和RLVR等推理增强技术也难以产生高质量假设。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在归纳和溯因推理方面仍有局限，特别是在处理复杂世界模型和生成高质量假设方面需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Reasoning is a core capability in artificial intelligence systems, for which
large language models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress. However,
most work focuses exclusively on deductive reasoning, which is problematic
since other types of reasoning are also essential in solving real-world
problems, and they are less explored. This work focuses on evaluating LLMs'
inductive and abductive reasoning capabilities. We introduce a programmable and
synthetic dataset, InAbHyD (pronounced in-a-bid), where each reasoning example
consists of an incomplete world model and a set of observations. The task for
the intelligent agent is to produce hypotheses to explain observations under
the incomplete world model to solve each reasoning example. We propose a new
metric to evaluate the quality of hypotheses based on Occam's Razor. We
evaluate and analyze some state-of-the-art LLMs. Our analysis shows that LLMs
can perform inductive and abductive reasoning in simple scenarios, but struggle
with complex world models and producing high-quality hypotheses, even with
popular reasoning-enhancing techniques such as in-context learning and RLVR.

Motivation: 现有的仪器人之间存在大量信息泄漏问题（最高达83%），需要一种更有效的信息控制机制来提高安全性和效率。

Method: 提出了一种底层框架，将AI仪器定位于环境中，所有行为都由环境变化触发。使用"aspects"概念（类似umwelt），不同仪器组以不同方式感知环境，实现信息控制。

Result: 与典型架构相比（最高83%的信息泄漏），该框架实现了零信息泄漏。

Conclusion: 专业化仪器在自身信息小生境中高效工作的概念，可以在安全性和效率方面带来显著改善。

Abstract: Agentic LLM AI agents are often little more than autonomous chatbots: actors
following scripts, often controlled by an unreliable director. This work
introduces a bottom-up framework that situates AI agents in their environment,
with all behaviors triggered by changes in their environments. It introduces
the notion of aspects, similar to the idea of umwelt, where sets of agents
perceive their environment differently to each other, enabling clearer control
of information. We provide an illustrative implementation and show that
compared to a typical architecture, which leaks up to 83% of the time,
aspective agentic AI enables zero information leakage. We anticipate that this
concept of specialist agents working efficiently in their own information
niches can provide improvements to both security and efficiency.

TL;DR: 该论文首次系统研究了具身AI系统的对抗性安全攻击，基于ISO标准提出了安全违规分类法，开发了ANNIEBench基准测试和ANNIE-Attack攻击框架，在真实机器人实验中验证了攻击成功率超过50%，揭示了具身AI系统中严重的安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉-语言-动作模型在具身AI机器人中的集成，系统面临新的安全风险：被破坏的VLA模型可以将感官输入的对抗扰动直接转化为不安全的物理动作。传统机器学习的安全定义和方法已不足以应对具身AI系统在物理交互环境中带来的新安全挑战。

Method: 1) 基于物理约束（分离距离、速度、碰撞边界）形式化安全违规分类法（关键、危险、风险）；2) 开发ANNIEBench基准测试，包含9个安全关键场景和2400个视频-动作序列；3) 提出ANNIE-Attack任务感知对抗框架，使用攻击引导模型将长时程目标分解为帧级扰动。

Result: 在代表性EAI模型上的评估显示，所有安全类别的攻击成功率均超过50%。通过稀疏和自适应攻击策略验证了实际影响，并在物理机器人实验中证实了攻击效果。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了具身AI系统中一个先前未被充分探索但影响重大的攻击面，强调了在物理AI时代迫切需要安全驱动的防御机制。

Abstract: The integration of vision-language-action (VLA) models into embodied AI (EAI)
robots is rapidly advancing their ability to perform complex, long-horizon
tasks in humancentric environments. However, EAI systems introduce critical
security risks: a compromised VLA model can directly translate adversarial
perturbations on sensory input into unsafe physical actions. Traditional safety
definitions and methodologies from the machine learning community are no longer
sufficient. EAI systems raise new questions, such as what constitutes safety,
how to measure it, and how to design effective attack and defense mechanisms in
physically grounded, interactive settings. In this work, we present the first
systematic study of adversarial safety attacks on embodied AI systems, grounded
in ISO standards for human-robot interactions. We (1) formalize a principled
taxonomy of safety violations (critical, dangerous, risky) based on physical
constraints such as separation distance, velocity, and collision boundaries;
(2) introduce ANNIEBench, a benchmark of nine safety-critical scenarios with
2,400 video-action sequences for evaluating embodied safety; and (3)
ANNIE-Attack, a task-aware adversarial framework with an attack leader model
that decomposes long-horizon goals into frame-level perturbations. Our
evaluation across representative EAI models shows attack success rates
exceeding 50% across all safety categories. We further demonstrate sparse and
adaptive attack strategies and validate the real-world impact through physical
robot experiments. These results expose a previously underexplored but highly
consequential attack surface in embodied AI systems, highlighting the urgent
need for security-driven defenses in the physical AI era. Code is available at

TL;DR: SAM-LLM是一种混合架构，将大语言模型的上下文推理能力与运动学车道变换模型的物理精度相结合，用于自动驾驶中的可解释车道变换轨迹预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统坐标预测方法缺乏物理可解释性和计算效率低的问题，通过参数化输出实现物理上合理的轨迹预测。

Method: 微调LLM以输出轨迹模型的核心物理参数（横向位移、机动持续时间、初始横向速度、纵向速度变化），而不是原始坐标。对于车道保持场景预测离散坐标，对于车道变换则生成增强正弦加速度模型(SAM)的参数。

Result: 实现了80%的输出尺寸缩减，总体意图预测准确率达到98.73%的state-of-the-art水平，在可解释性和资源效率方面具有显著优势。

Conclusion: SAM-LLM在保持与传统LLM预测器相当性能的同时，提供了更好的可解释性和计算效率，为自动驾驶轨迹预测提供了新的参数化解决方案。

Abstract: This work introduces SAM-LLM, a novel hybrid architecture that bridges the
gap between the contextual reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the
physical precision of kinematic lane change models for autonomous driving. The
system is designed for interpretable lane change trajectory prediction by
finetuning an LLM to output the core physical parameters of a trajectory model
instead of raw coordinates. For lane-keeping scenarios, the model predicts
discrete coordinates, but for lane change maneuvers, it generates the
parameters for an enhanced Sinusoidal Acceleration Model (SAM), including
lateral displacement, maneuver duration, initial lateral velocity, and
longitudinal velocity change. This parametric approach yields a complete,
continuous, and physically plausible trajectory model that is inherently
interpretable and computationally efficient, achieving an 80% reduction in
output size compared to coordinate-based methods. The SAM-LLM achieves a
state-of-the-art overall intention prediction accuracy of 98.73%, demonstrating
performance equivalent to traditional LLM predictors while offering significant
advantages in explainability and resource efficiency.

Abstract: Simulacra Naturae is a data-driven media installation that explores
collective care through the entanglement of biological computation, material
ecologies, and generative systems. The work translates pre-recorded neural
activity from brain organoids, lab-grown three-dimensional clusters of neurons,
into a multi-sensory environment composed of generative visuals, spatial audio,
living plants, and fabricated clay artifacts. These biosignals, streamed
through a real-time system, modulate emergent agent behaviors inspired by
natural systems such as termite colonies and slime molds. Rather than using
biosignals as direct control inputs, Simulacra Naturae treats organoid activity
as a co-creative force, allowing neural rhythms to guide the growth, form, and
atmosphere of a generative ecosystem. The installation features computationally
fabricated clay prints embedded with solenoids, adding physical sound
resonances to the generative surround composition. The spatial environment,
filled with live tropical plants and a floor-level projection layer featuring
real-time generative AI visuals, invites participants into a sensory field
shaped by nonhuman cognition. By grounding abstract data in living materials
and embodied experience, Simulacra Naturae reimagines visualization as a
practice of care, one that decentralizes human agency and opens new spaces for
ethics, empathy, and ecological attunement within hybrid computational systems.

Result: 显著降低了数据采集和手工编辑成本，提高了模拟路网生成的效率和准确性

Conclusion: 该方法为城市交通模拟、自主驾驶导航和智能交通系统开发提供了可靠数据支持，为大规模城市路网自动建模提供了新的技术路径

Abstract: Existing lane-level simulation road network generation is labor-intensive,
resource-demanding, and costly due to the need for large-scale data collection
and manual post-editing. To overcome these limitations, we propose
automatically generating high-precision simulated road networks in traffic
scenario, an efficient and fully automated solution. Initially, real-world road
street view data is collected through open-source street view map platforms,
and a large-scale street view lane line dataset is constructed to provide a
robust foundation for subsequent analysis. Next, an end-to-end lane line
detection approach based on deep learning is designed, where a neural network
model is trained to accurately detect the number and spatial distribution of
lane lines in street view images, enabling automated extraction of lane
information. Subsequently, by integrating coordinate transformation and map
matching algorithms, the extracted lane information from street views is fused
with the foundational road topology obtained from open-source map service
platforms, resulting in the generation of a high-precision lane-level
simulation road network. This method significantly reduces the costs associated
with data collection and manual editing while enhancing the efficiency and
accuracy of simulation road network generation. It provides reliable data
support for urban traffic simulation, autonomous driving navigation, and the
development of intelligent transportation systems, offering a novel technical
pathway for the automated modeling of large-scale urban road networks.

Conclusion: 该方法论能够有效解决微服务系统在系统架构等多个方面的验证问题，为未来扩展和评估基础指明了方向

Abstract: Microservice systems are becoming increasingly adopted due to their
scalability, decentralized development, and support for continuous integration
and delivery (CI/CD). However, this decentralized development by separate teams
and continuous evolution can introduce miscommunication and incompatible
implementations, undermining system maintainability and reliability across
aspects from security policy to system architecture. We propose a novel
methodology that statically reconstructs microservice source code into a formal
system model. From this model, a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)
constraint set can be derived, enabling formal verification. Our methodology is
extensible, supporting software verification across multiple cross-cutting
concerns. We focus on applying the methodology to verify the system
architecture concern, presenting formal reasoning to validate the methodology's
correctness and applicability for this concern. Additional concerns such as
security policy implementation are considered. Future directions are
established to extend and evaluate the methodology.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于提示工程的LLM评估方法，用于检测多语言代码库中的SOLID原则违反，测试了4个主流LLM模型在不同提示策略下的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态分析方法难以检测语义设计缺陷（如SOLID原则违反），现有解决方案通常只关注单个原则或特定语言，缺乏跨所有五个原则的多语言检测能力。

Method: 构建包含240个手动验证代码示例的新基准数据集，测试四种不同的提示策略（零样本、少样本、思维链等），系统评估四个领先LLM模型（CodeLlama、DeepSeekCoder、QwenCoder、GPT-4o Mini）的检测能力。

Result: GPT-4o Mini表现最佳但仍难以处理DIP等复杂原则；提示策略对检测准确率有显著影响但无单一最优策略；检测准确率受语言特性和代码复杂度影响较大。

Conclusion: 有效的AI驱动设计分析需要根据具体设计上下文匹配合适的模型和提示策略，而非单一最佳模型，展示了LLM通过AI辅助代码分析支持可维护性的潜力。

Abstract: Traditional static analysis methods struggle to detect semantic design flaws,
such as violations of the SOLID principles, which require a strong
understanding of object-oriented design patterns and principles. Existing
solutions typically focus on individual SOLID principles or specific
programming languages, leaving a gap in the ability to detect violations across
all five principles in multi-language codebases. This paper presents a new
approach: a methodology that leverages tailored prompt engineering to assess
LLMs on their ability to detect SOLID violations across multiple languages. We
present a benchmark of four leading LLMs-CodeLlama, DeepSeekCoder, QwenCoder,
and GPT-4o Mini-on their ability to detect violations of all five SOLID
principles. For this evaluation, we construct a new benchmark dataset of 240
manually validated code examples. Using this dataset, we test four distinct
prompt strategies inspired by established zero-shot, few-shot, and
chain-of-thought techniques to systematically measure their impact on detection
accuracy. Our emerging results reveal a stark hierarchy among models, with
GPT-4o Mini decisively outperforming others, yet even struggles with
challenging principles like DIP. Crucially, we show that prompt strategy has a
dramatic impact, but no single strategy is universally best; for instance, a
deliberative ENSEMBLE prompt excels at OCP detection while a hint-based EXAMPLE
prompt is superior for DIP violations. Across all experiments, detection
accuracy is heavily influenced by language characteristics and degrades sharply
with increasing code complexity. These initial findings demonstrate that
effective, AI-driven design analysis requires not a single best model, but a
tailored approach that matches the right model and prompt to the specific
design context, highlighting the potential of LLMs to support maintainability
through AI-assisted code analysis.

Motivation: AI技术在电动汽车中的应用带来了独特的安全保障挑战，传统的ISO 26262评估方法无法有效评估基于AI的功能，需要新的标准和方法。

Method: 结合ISO 26262和ISO/PAS 8800标准，以AI驱动的电池SOC估计为例，通过系统性地注入扰动传感器输入进行故障注入实验，评估AI组件对输入变化的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology in electric vehicles (EV)
introduces unique challenges for safety assurance, particularly within the
framework of ISO 26262, which governs functional safety in the automotive
domain. Traditional assessment methodologies are not geared toward evaluating
AI-based functions and require evolving standards and practices. This paper
explores how an independent assessment of an AI component in an EV can be
achieved when combining ISO 26262 with the recently released ISO/PAS 8800,
whose scope is AI safety for road vehicles. The AI-driven State of Charge (SOC)
battery estimation exemplifies the process. Key features relevant to the
independent assessment of this extended evaluation approach are identified. As
part of the evaluation, robustness testing of the AI component is conducted
using fault injection experiments, wherein perturbed sensor inputs are
systematically introduced to assess the component's resilience to input
variance.

Motivation: 现有漏洞修复评估数据集主要依赖表面验证而非基于漏洞利用的验证，导致在安全敏感应用中高估了LLM的性能表现。

Method: 构建包含23个Python CVE真实漏洞实例的基准测试集，使用容器化评估管道进行可重现的差异评估，要求修复成功必须使原始漏洞利用代码执行失败。

Result: 评估12个流行LLM发现性能严重不足，最佳模型仅成功修复5/23个实例（21.7%）。失败分析显示主要问题是不精确的漏洞识别和包含语法/语义错误的补丁。

Conclusion: 需要建立能够真实反映现实世界漏洞利用场景的严格评估协议，当前LLM在安全关键应用中的漏洞修复能力仍有重大局限。

Abstract: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated software
vulnerability patching has shown promising outcomes on carefully curated
evaluation sets. Nevertheless, existing datasets predominantly rely on
superficial validation methods rather than exploit-based verification, leading
to overestimated performance in security-sensitive applications. This paper
introduces VulnRepairEval, an evaluation framework anchored in functional
Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploits. Our framework delivers a comprehensive,
containerized evaluation pipeline that enables reproducible differential
assessment, where repair success requires the original exploit to fail
execution against the modified code. The benchmark construction involved
extensive data curation: we processed over 400 CVEs and approximately 2,500
potential sources to extract a collection of authentic vulnerability instances
(23 Python CVEs) amenable to automated testing with working PoCs. Through
VulnRepairEval, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 12 popular LLMs and
observe a significant performance deficit: even the top-performing model
successfully addresses merely 5/23 instances (about 21.7%), exposing critical
weaknesses in security-focused applications. Our failure analysis reveals that
most unsuccessful attempts stem from imprecise vulnerability identification and
patches containing syntactic or semantic errors. Enhanced prompting strategies
and multi-agent approaches yield minimal improvements, with overall
effectiveness remaining largely unaffected. This work contributes a stringent,
practical evaluation framework for LLM-driven vulnerability remediation and
underscores the necessity for assessment protocols that authentically reflect
real-world exploitation scenarios.

Result: 实验表明：批判-精炼循环比单次生成效果更好；算法结构检查比LLM检查平均提高正确率17.81%和完整度13.24%；算法结构检查+LLM语义检查组合达到最佳性能（正确率86.37%，完整度88.56%），平均需要少于5次LLM调用。

Conclusion: LADEX证明了迭代式生成-批判-精炼方法的有效性，算法结构检查与LLM语义检查的组合是最优方案，能够在较少LLM调用的情况下实现高质量的活动图生成。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong potential for automating the
generation of models from natural-language descriptions. A common approach is
an iterative generate-critique-refine loop, where candidate models are
produced, evaluated, and updated based on detected issues. This process needs
to address: (1) structural correctness - compliance with well-formedness rules
- and (2) semantic alignment - accurate reflection of the intended meaning in
the source text. We present LADEX (LLM-based Activity Diagram Extractor), a
pipeline for deriving activity diagrams from natural-language process
descriptions using an LLM-driven critique-refine process. Structural checks in
LADEX can be performed either algorithmically or by an LLM, while alignment
checks are always performed by an LLM. We design five ablated variants of LADEX
to study: (i) the impact of the critique-refine loop itself, (ii) the role of
LLM-based semantic checks, and (iii) the comparative effectiveness of
algorithmic versus LLM-based structural checks.
  To evaluate LADEX, we compare the generated activity diagrams with
expert-created ground truths using trace-based operational semantics. This
enables automated measurement of correctness and completeness. Experiments on
two datasets indicate that: (1) the critique-refine loop improves structural
validity, correctness, and completeness compared to single-pass generation; (2)
algorithmic structural checks eliminate inconsistencies that LLM-based checks
fail to detect, improving correctness by an average of 17.81% and completeness
by 13.24% over LLM-only checks; and (3) combining algorithmic structural checks
with LLM-based semantic checks, implemented using the reasoning-focused O4
Mini, achieves the best overall performance - yielding average correctness of
up to 86.37% and average completeness of up to 88.56% - while requiring fewer
than five LLM calls on average.
