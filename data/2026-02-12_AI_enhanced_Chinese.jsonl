Conference: AAMAS 2026", "summary": "We study the computational complexity of strategic behaviour in primary elections. Unlike direct voting systems, primaries introduce a multi-stage process in which voters first influence intra-party nominees before a general election determines the final winner. While previous work has evaluated primaries via welfare distortion, we instead examine their game-theoretic properties. We formalise a model of primaries under first-past-the-post with fixed tie-breaking and analyse voters' strategic behaviour. We show that determining whether a pure Nash equilibrium exists is $\u03a3_2^{\\mathbf P}$-complete, computing a best response is NP-complete, and deciding the existence of subgame-perfect equilibria in sequential primaries is PSPACE-complete. These results reveal that primaries fundamentally increase the computational difficulty of strategic reasoning, situating them as a rich source of complexity-theoretic challenges within computational social choice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u521d\u9009\u4e2d\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u884c\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u521d\u9009\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u76f8\u5173\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u590d\u6742\u5ea6", "motivation": "\u521d\u9009\u4f5c\u4e3a\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u9009\u4e3e\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e0e\u76f4\u63a5\u6295\u7968\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u7279\u6027\u3002\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u798f\u5229\u626d\u66f2\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u8f6c\u5411\u5206\u6790\u521d\u9009\u4e2d\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u884c\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u591a\u6570\u5236\uff08first-past-the-post\uff09\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u5e73\u5c40\u6253\u7834\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u521d\u9009\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u9009\u6c11\u7b56\u7565\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u76f8\u5173\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\uff1a\u5224\u65ad\u7eaf\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u5b58\u5728\u662f\u03a3\u2082\u1d3e\u5b8c\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f73\u54cd\u5e94\u662fNP\u5b8c\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u5224\u65ad\u987a\u5e8f\u521d\u9009\u4e2d\u5b50\u535a\u5f08\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5747\u8861\u5b58\u5728\u662fPSPACE\u5b8c\u5168\u95ee\u9898", "conclusion": "\u521d\u9009\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u793e\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u6311\u6218\u6765\u6e90"}}

Despite the crucial role that these services play in meeting mobility needs, governments often do not account for these services or their underlying incentives when planning transit systems, which can significantly compromise system efficiency.\n  Against this backdrop, we develop a framework to analyze the incentives underlying informal and privatized transit systems, while proposing mechanisms to guide public transit operation and incentive design when a substantial share of mobility is provided by such profit-driven private operators. We introduce a novel, analytically tractable game-theoretic model of a fully privatized informal transit system with a fixed menu of routes, in which profit-maximizing informal operators (drivers) decide where to provide service and cost-minimizing commuters (riders) decide whether to use these services. Within this framework, we establish tight price of anarchy bounds which demonstrate that decentralized, profit-maximizing driver behavior can lead to bounded yet substantial losses in cumulative driver profit and rider demand served. We further show that these performance losses can be mitigated through targeted interventions, including Stackelberg routing mechanisms in which a modest share of drivers are centrally controlled, reflecting environments where informal operators coexist with public transit, and cross-subsidization schemes that use route-specific tolls or subsidies to incentivize drivers to operate on particular routes. Finally, we reinforce these findings through numerical experiments based on a real-world informal transit system in Nalasopara, India.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u6790\u975e\u6b63\u5f0f\u548c\u79c1\u6709\u5316\u4ea4\u901a\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5206\u6563\u5316\u5229\u6da6\u6700\u5927\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u7387\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5e72\u9884\u673a\u5236\u6539\u5584\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u975e\u6b63\u5f0f\u548c\u79c1\u6709\u5316\u4ea4\u901a\u670d\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u5c0f\u5df4\u3001\u5171\u4eab\u4e09\u8f6e\u8f66\uff09\u5728\u5927\u578b\u57ce\u5e02\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u653f\u5e9c\u89c4\u5212\u65f6\u5f80\u5f80\u5ffd\u7565\u8fd9\u4e9b\u670d\u52a1\u53ca\u5176\u6fc0\u52b1\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u7387\u53d7\u635f", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u3001\u5206\u6790\u4e0a\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5229\u6da6\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7684\u975e\u6b63\u5f0f\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7684\u901a\u52e4\u8005\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4ef7\u683c\u65e0\u653f\u5e9c\u72b6\u6001\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faStackelberg\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u548c\u8de8\u8865\u8d34\u65b9\u6848\u7b49\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd", "result": "\u5206\u6563\u5316\u3001\u5229\u6da6\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7684\u53f8\u673a\u884c\u4e3a\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7d2f\u79ef\u53f8\u673a\u5229\u6da6\u548c\u6ee1\u8db3\u7684\u4e58\u5ba2\u9700\u6c42\u51fa\u73b0\u6709\u754c\u4f46\u663e\u8457\u7684\u635f\u5931\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5e72\u9884\uff08\u5982\u90e8\u5206\u53f8\u673a\u96c6\u4e2d\u63a7\u5236\u7684Stackelberg\u673a\u5236\u3001\u8def\u7ebf\u7279\u5b9a\u6536\u8d39/\u8865\u8d34\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931", "conclusion": "\u975e\u6b63\u5f0f\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u6548\u7387\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u673a\u5236\u6539\u5584\uff1b\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u5728\u5370\u5ea6Nalasopara\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u975e\u6b63\u5f0f\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1"}}

In this setting, the seller must learn the optimal monopoly price by posting prices and observing only binary purchase decisions, rather than the realized valuations. Prior work has established tight query complexity bounds for learning a near-optimal price with additive error $\\varepsilon$ when the valuation distribution is supported on $[0,1]$. However, our understanding of how to learn a near-optimal price that achieves at least a $(1-\\varepsilon)$ fraction of the optimal revenue remains limited.\n  In this paper, we study the pricing query complexity of the single-buyer revenue maximization problem under such multiplicative error guarantees in several settings. Observe that when pricing queries are the only source of information about the buyer's distribution, no algorithm can achieve a non-trivial approximation, since the scale of the distribution cannot be learned from pricing queries alone. Motivated by this fundamental impossibility, we consider two natural and well-motivated models that provide \"scale hints\": (i) a one-sample hint, in which the algorithm observes a single realized valuation before making pricing queries; and (ii) a value-range hint, in which the valuation support is known to lie within $[1, H]$. For each type of hint, we establish pricing query complexity guarantees that are tight up to polylogarithmic factors for several classes of distributions, including monotone hazard rate (MHR) distributions, regular distributions, and general distributions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5355\u4e70\u5bb6\u6536\u76ca\u6700\u5927\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5b9a\u4ef7\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u4e58\u6027\u8bef\u5dee\u4fdd\u8bc1\u800c\u975e\u52a0\u6027\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\"\u5c3a\u5ea6\u63d0\u793a\"\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\uff08\u5355\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u503c\u57df\u63d0\u793a\uff09\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u7c7b\u522b\u5efa\u7acb\u7d27\u81f4\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u754c\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u52a0\u6027\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9a\u4ef7\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e58\u6027\u8bef\u5dee\uff08\u5373\u83b7\u5f97\u81f3\u5c11(1-\u03b5)\u500d\u6700\u4f18\u6536\u76ca\uff09\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u6709\u9650\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4ef7\u67e5\u8be2\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f15\u5165\u989d\u5916\u7684\"\u5c3a\u5ea6\u63d0\u793a\"\u6765\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e00\u6839\u672c\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8003\u8651\u4e24\u79cd\"\u5c3a\u5ea6\u63d0\u793a\"\u6a21\u578b\uff1a1\uff09\u5355\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\uff1a\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5f00\u59cb\u5b9a\u4ef7\u67e5\u8be2\u524d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u4f30\u503c\u6837\u672c\uff1b2\uff09\u503c\u57df\u63d0\u793a\uff1a\u5df2\u77e5\u4f30\u503c\u652f\u6301\u96c6\u5728[1, H]\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u6bcf\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790MHR\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u6b63\u5219\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u4e00\u822c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5b9a\u4ef7\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u4e3a\u6bcf\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u7c7b\u522b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7d27\u81f4\u7684\u5b9a\u4ef7\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u754c\u9650\uff08\u6700\u591a\u76f8\u5dee\u591a\u5bf9\u6570\u56e0\u5b50\uff09\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u4e58\u6027\u8bef\u5dee\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e0b\u5b9a\u4ef7\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\"\u5c3a\u5ea6\u63d0\u793a\"\u6a21\u578b\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4ec5\u7528\u5b9a\u4ef7\u67e5\u8be2\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u5e03\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u6839\u672c\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u5355\u4e70\u5bb6\u6536\u76ca\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7684\u4e58\u6027\u8fd1\u4f3c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u523b\u753b\uff0c\u5bf9MHR\u3001\u6b63\u5219\u548c\u4e00\u822c\u5206\u5e03\u90fd\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u7d27\u81f4\u754c\u9650\u3002"}}

The model separately processes visible and non-visible channels through dual ConvNeXt encoders, followed by individual decoders that reconstruct spatial information. A dedicated fusion decoder integrates intermediate features at multiple scales, combining fine spatial cues with high-level spectral representations. The feature fusion is further enhanced with CBAM attention, and the ASAU activation function contributes to stable and efficient optimization. The model is designed to process different spectral configurations, including a 4-channel (4c) input combining RGB and NIR bands, as well as a 6-channel (6c) input incorporating NDVI and NDWI indices. Experiments on the Five-Billion-Pixels (FBP) and Potsdam datasets demonstrate significant performance gains. On FBP, MeCSAFNet-base (6c) surpasses U-Net (4c) by +19.21%, U-Net (6c) by +14.72%, SegFormer (4c) by +19.62%, and SegFormer (6c) by +14.74% in mIoU. On Potsdam, MeCSAFNet-large (4c) improves over DeepLabV3+ (4c) by +6.48%, DeepLabV3+ (6c) by +5.85%, SegFormer (4c) by +9.11%, and SegFormer (6c) by +4.80% in mIoU.

In this article, we present ImprovEvolve, a simple yet effective technique for enhancing LLM-based evolutionary approaches such as AlphaEvolve. Given an optimization problem, the standard approach is to evolve program code that, when executed, produces a solution close to the optimum. We propose an alternative program parameterization that maintains the ability to construct optimal solutions while reducing the cognitive load on the LLM. Specifically, we evolve a program (implementing, e.g., a Python class with a prescribed interface) that provides the following functionality: (1) propose a valid initial solution, (2) improve any given solution in terms of fitness, and (3) perturb a solution with a specified intensity. The optimum can then be approached by iteratively applying improve() and perturb() with a scheduled intensity. We evaluate ImprovEvolve on challenging problems from the AlphaEvolve paper: hexagon packing in a hexagon and the second autocorrelation inequality. For hexagon packing, the evolved program achieves new state-of-the-art results for 11, 12, 15, and 16 hexagons; a lightly human-edited variant further improves results for 14, 17, and 23 hexagons. For the second autocorrelation inequality, the human-edited program achieves a new state-of-the-art lower bound of 0.96258, improving upon AlphaEvolve's 0.96102.", "AI": {"tldr": "ImprovEvolve\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a0b\u5e8f\u63a5\u53e3\uff08\u521d\u59cb\u89e3\u3001\u6539\u8fdb\u89e3\u3001\u6270\u52a8\u89e3\uff09\u6765\u964d\u4f4eLLM\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\uff0c\u5728\u516d\u8fb9\u5f62\u586b\u5145\u548c\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "AlphaEvolve\u7b49LLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u6784\u9020\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981LLM\u76f4\u63a5\u6f14\u5316\u4ea7\u751f\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u8fd9\u7ed9LLM\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u627e\u5230\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u53d1\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u964d\u4f4eLLM\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faImprovEvolve\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6f14\u5316\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u63a5\u53e3\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff08\u5982Python\u7c7b\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u7a0b\u5e8f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u529f\u80fd\uff1a(1) propose() - \u63d0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u521d\u59cb\u89e3\uff0c(2) improve() - \u6539\u8fdb\u7ed9\u5b9a\u89e3\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u9002\u5e94\u5ea6\uff0c(3) perturb() - \u4ee5\u6307\u5b9a\u5f3a\u5ea6\u6270\u52a8\u89e3\u3002\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u5e94\u7528improve()\u548cperturb()\uff0c\u914d\u5408\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u903c\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5728AlphaEvolve\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u6311\u6218\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff1a\u5bf9\u4e8e\u516d\u8fb9\u5f62\u586b\u5145\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6f14\u5316\u7a0b\u5e8f\u572811\u300112\u300115\u300116\u4e2a\u516d\u8fb9\u5f62\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7ed3\u679c\uff1b\u8f7b\u5fae\u4eba\u5de5\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u53d8\u4f53\u572814\u300117\u300123\u4e2a\u516d\u8fb9\u5f62\u4e0a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7b2c\u4e8c\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u7f16\u8f91\u7a0b\u5e8f\u83b7\u5f97\u4e860.96258\u7684\u65b0\u6700\u4f18\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eAlphaEvolve\u76840.96102\u3002", "conclusion": "ImprovEvolve\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u53d1\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86LLM\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u800c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

In particular, existing solutions excel either at specific filter categories (e.g., label equality) or within narrow selectivity bands (e.g., pre-filtering for low selectivity) and are therefore a poor fit for practical deployments that demand generalization to new filter types and unknown query selectivities. In this paper, we propose JAG (Joint Attribute Graphs), a graph-based algorithm designed to deliver robust performance across the entire selectivity spectrum and support diverse filter types. Our key innovation is the introduction of attribute and filter distances, which transform binary filter constraints into continuous navigational guidance. By constructing a proximity graph that jointly optimizes for both vector similarity and attribute proximity, JAG prevents navigational dead-ends and allows JAG to consistently outperform prior graph-based filtered nearest neighbor search methods. Our experimental results across five datasets and four filter types (Label, Range, Subset, Boolean) demonstrate that JAG significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines in both throughput and recall robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "JAG (Joint Attribute Graphs) \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u56fe\u57fa\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u5c06\u4e8c\u5143\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7ea6\u675f\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u5bfc\u822a\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u7387\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u67e5\u8be2\u9009\u62e9\u7387\u548c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7c7b\u578b\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u64c5\u957f\u7279\u5b9a\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7c7b\u522b\uff08\u5982\u6807\u7b7e\u76f8\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u53ea\u5728\u72ed\u7a84\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u7387\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff08\u5982\u4f4e\u9009\u62e9\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u9884\u8fc7\u6ee4\uff09\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u65b0\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u67e5\u8be2\u9009\u62e9\u7387\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faJAG\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u8ddd\u79bb\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5c06\u4e8c\u5143\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7ea6\u675f\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u5bfc\u822a\u6307\u5bfc\u3002\u6784\u5efa\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u5411\u91cf\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u90bb\u8fd1\u6027\u7684\u90bb\u8fd1\u56fe\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u5bfc\u822a\u6b7b\u80e1\u540c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u6807\u7b7e\u3001\u8303\u56f4\u3001\u5b50\u96c6\u3001\u5e03\u5c14\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u56db\u79cd\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u6807\u7b7e\u3001\u8303\u56f4\u3001\u5b50\u96c6\u3001\u5e03\u5c14\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cJAG\u5728\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u53ec\u56de\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u56fe\u57fa\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "JAG\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5411\u91cf\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u90bb\u8fd1\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u9009\u62e9\u7387\u8c31\u7cfb\u4e0a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5411\u91cf\u641c\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Recently, a number of diffusion model-based generative image steganography (DM-GIS) methods have been introduced, which effectively combat traditional steganalysis techniques. In this paper, we identify the key factors that influence DM-GIS security and revisit the security of existing methods. Specifically, we first provide an overview of the general pipelines of current DM-GIS methods, finding that the noise space of diffusion models serves as the primary embedding domain. Further, we analyze the relationship between DM-GIS security and noise distribution of diffusion models, theoretically demonstrating that any steganographic operation that disrupts the noise distribution compromise DM-GIS security. Building on this insight, we propose a Noise Space-based Diffusion Steganalyzer (NS-DSer)-a simple yet effective steganalysis framework allowing for detecting DM-GIS generated images in the diffusion model noise space. We reevaluate the security of existing DM-GIS methods using NS-DSer across increasingly challenging detection scenarios.

A key barrier is security: the inherently nondeterministic behavior of LLM agents defies static auditing approaches that have historically underpinned software assurance. Existing security methods, such as proxy-level input filtering and model glassboxing, fail to provide sufficient transparency or traceability into agent reasoning, state changes, or environmental interactions. In this work, we introduce AgentTrace, a dynamic observability and telemetry framework designed to fill this gap. AgentTrace instruments agents at runtime with minimal overhead, capturing a rich stream of structured logs across three surfaces: operational, cognitive, and contextual. Unlike traditional logging systems, AgentTrace emphasizes continuous, introspectable trace capture, designed not just for debugging or benchmarking, but as a foundational layer for agent security, accountability, and real-time monitoring. Our research highlights how AgentTrace can enable more reliable agent deployment, fine-grained risk analysis, and informed trust calibration, thereby addressing critical concerns that have so far limited the use of LLM agents in sensitive environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "AgentTrace\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u548c\u9065\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u9650\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u969c\u788d\u662f\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff1aLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u4f7f\u5f97\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u9759\u6001\u5ba1\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5931\u6548\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u4ee3\u7406\u7ea7\u8f93\u5165\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u767d\u76d2\u5316\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u6216\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\u6765\u4e86\u89e3\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3001\u72b6\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u6216\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "method": "AgentTrace\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u548c\u9065\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5f00\u9500\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u6355\u83b7\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u65e5\u5fd7\u6d41\uff1a\u64cd\u4f5c\u5c42\u9762\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c42\u9762\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5c42\u9762\u3002\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65e5\u5fd7\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u540c\uff0cAgentTrace\u5f3a\u8c03\u8fde\u7eed\u3001\u53ef\u5185\u7701\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7684\u6355\u83b7\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u7528\u4e8e\u8c03\u8bd5\u6216\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8fd8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u95ee\u8d23\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u63a7\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u5c42\u3002", "result": "AgentTrace\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u90e8\u7f72\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u6790\u548c\u77e5\u60c5\u4fe1\u4efb\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u89e3\u51b3\u8fc4\u4eca\u4e3a\u6b62\u9650\u5236LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u654f\u611f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "AgentTrace\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u548c\u9065\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5b89\u5168\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Prior work treats lazy thinking detection as a single-label task, but review segments may exhibit multiple issues, including broader clarity problems, or specificity issues. Turning detection into actionable improvements requires guideline-aware feedback, which is currently missing.

Prior work on modified Rankin Scale (mRS) prediction has relied primarily on structured variables (e.g., age, NIHSS) and conventional machine learning. The ability of large language models (LLMs) to infer future mRS scores directly from routine admission notes remains largely unexplored. We evaluated encoder (BERT, NYUTron) and generative (Llama-3.1-8B, MedGemma-4B) LLMs, in both frozen and fine-tuned settings, for discharge and 90-day mRS prediction using a large, real-world stroke registry. The discharge outcome dataset included 9,485 History and Physical notes and the 90-day outcome dataset included 1,898 notes from the NYU Langone Get With The Guidelines-Stroke registry (2016-2025). Data were temporally split with the most recent 12 months held out for testing. Performance was assessed using exact (7-class) mRS accuracy and binary functional outcome (mRS 0-2 vs. 3-6) accuracy and compared against established structured-data baselines incorporating NIHSS and age. Fine-tuned Llama achieved the highest performance, with 90-day exact mRS accuracy of 33.9% [95% CI, 27.9-39.9%] and binary accuracy of 76.3% [95% CI, 70.7-81.9%]. Discharge performance reached 42.0% [95% CI, 39.0-45.0%] exact accuracy and 75.0% [95% CI, 72.4-77.6%] binary accuracy. For 90-day prediction, Llama performed comparably to structured-data baselines. Fine-tuned LLMs can predict post-stroke functional outcomes from admission notes alone, achieving performance comparable to models requiring structured variable abstraction.

However, the size of the normal-form representation grows exponentially with the number of parallel information sets, making the direct determination of normal-form proper equilibria intractable. To address this challenge, we develop a compact sequence-form proper equilibrium by redefining the expected payoffs over sequences, and we prove that it coincides with the normal-form proper equilibrium via strategic equivalence. To facilitate computation, we further introduce an alternative representation by defining a class of perturbed games based on an $\\varepsilon$-permutahedron over sequences. Building on this representation, we introduce two differentiable path-following methods for computing normal-form proper equilibria. These methods rely on artificial sequence-form games whose expected payoff functions incorporate logarithmic or entropy regularization through an auxiliary variable. We prove the existence of a smooth equilibrium path induced by each artificial game, starting from an arbitrary positive realization plan and converging to a normal-form proper equilibrium of the original game as the auxiliary variable approaches zero.

The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has revolutionized this domain, yet the landscape of MLLM-based chart analysis remains fragmented and lacks systematic organization. This survey provides a comprehensive roadmap of this nascent frontier by structuring the domain's core components. We begin by analyzing the fundamental challenges of fusing visual and linguistic information in charts. We then categorize downstream tasks and datasets, introducing a novel taxonomy of canonical and non-canonical benchmarks to highlight the field's expanding scope. Subsequently, we present a comprehensive evolution of methodologies, tracing the progression from classic deep learning techniques to state-of-the-art MLLM paradigms that leverage sophisticated fusion strategies. By critically examining the limitations of current models, particularly their perceptual and reasoning deficits, we identify promising future directions, including advanced alignment techniques and reinforcement learning for cognitive enhancement.

However, designing images that consistently elicit desired neural responses is difficult: subjective states lack clear quantitative measures, and EEG feedback is both noisy and non-differentiable. We introduce MindPilot, the first closed-loop framework that uses EEG signals as optimization feedback to guide naturalistic image generation. Unlike prior work limited to invasive settings or low-level flicker stimuli, MindPilot leverages non-invasive EEG with natural images, treating the brain as a black-box function and employing a pseudo-model guidance mechanism to iteratively refine images without requiring explicit rewards or gradients. We validate MindPilot in both simulation and human experiments, demonstrating (i) efficient retrieval of semantic targets, (ii) closed-loop optimization of EEG features, and (iii) human-subject validations in mental matching and emotion regulation tasks.

To address these challenges, we are motivated to adopt a query-centric formulation that projects cross-modal and cross-page information into a unified query representation space, with queries acting as abstract semantic surrogates for heterogeneous multimodal content. In this paper, we propose a Multimodal Long-Context Document Retrieval Augmented Generation (MLDocRAG) framework that leverages a Multimodal Chunk-Query Graph (MCQG) to organize multimodal document content around semantically rich, answerable queries. MCQG is constructed via a multimodal document expansion process that generates fine-grained queries from heterogeneous document chunks and links them to their corresponding content across modalities and pages. This graph-based structure enables selective, query-centric retrieval and structured evidence aggregation, thereby enhancing grounding and coherence in long-context multimodal question answering.

However, we identify a previously underexplored generation failure: severe output repetition, where models degenerate into self-reinforcing loops of repeated phrases or sentences. This failure mode is not captured by existing VideoLLM benchmarks, which focus primarily on task accuracy and factual correctness. We introduce VideoSTF, the first framework for systematically measuring and stress-testing output repetition in VideoLLMs. VideoSTF formalizes repetition using three complementary n-gram-based metrics and provides a standardized testbed of 10,000 diverse videos together with a library of controlled temporal transformations. Using VideoSTF, we conduct pervasive testing, temporal stress testing, and adversarial exploitation across 10 advanced VideoLLMs. We find that output repetition is widespread and, critically, highly sensitive to temporal perturbations of video inputs. Moreover, we show that simple temporal transformations can efficiently induce repetitive degeneration in a black-box setting, exposing output repetition as an exploitable security vulnerability. Our results reveal output repetition as a fundamental stability issue in modern VideoLLMs and motivate stability-aware evaluation for video-language systems.

We address this question by evaluating 17 contemporary LLMs on a controlled ODD-to-code translation task, using the PPHPC predator-prey model as a fully specified reference. Generated Python implementations are assessed through staged executability checks, model-independent statistical comparison against a validated NetLogo baseline, and quantitative measures of runtime efficiency and maintainability. Results show that behaviorally faithful implementations are achievable but not guaranteed, and that executability alone is insufficient for scientific use. GPT-4.1 consistently produces statistically valid and efficient implementations, with Claude 3.7 Sonnet performing well but less reliably.

However, existing medical benchmarks remain static, suffering from two critical limitations: (1) data contamination, where test sets inadvertently leak into training corpora, leading to inflated performance estimates; and (2) temporal misalignment, failing to capture the rapid evolution of medical knowledge. Furthermore, current evaluation metrics for open-ended clinical reasoning often rely on either shallow lexical overlap (e.g., ROUGE) or subjective LLM-as-a-Judge scoring, both inadequate for verifying clinical correctness. To bridge these gaps, we introduce LiveMedBench, a continuously updated, contamination-free, and rubric-based benchmark that weekly harvests real-world clinical cases from online medical communities, ensuring strict temporal separation from model training data. We propose a Multi-Agent Clinical Curation Framework that filters raw data noise and validates clinical integrity against evidence-based medical principles. For evaluation, we develop an Automated Rubric-based Evaluation Framework that decomposes physician responses into granular, case-specific criteria, achieving substantially stronger alignment with expert physicians than LLM-as-a-Judge. To date, LiveMedBench comprises 2,756 real-world cases spanning 38 medical specialties and multiple languages, paired with 16,702 unique evaluation criteria. Extensive evaluation of 38 LLMs reveals that even the best-performing model achieves only 39.2%, and 84% of models exhibit performance degradation on post-cutoff cases, confirming pervasive data contamination risks. Error analysis further identifies contextual application-not factual knowledge-as the dominant bottleneck, with 35-48% of failures stemming from the inability to tailor medical knowledge to patient-specific constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "LiveMedBench\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u6301\u7eed\u66f4\u65b0\u3001\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bcf\u5468\u4ece\u5728\u7ebf\u533b\u7597\u793e\u533a\u6536\u96c6\u771f\u5b9e\u75c5\u4f8b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u533b\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u9519\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc4\u5206\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u533b\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1\uff09\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\uff08\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u6cc4\u9732\u5230\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u865a\u9ad8\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u65f6\u95f4\u9519\u4f4d\uff08\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u533b\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6f14\u53d8\uff09\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u6d45\u5c42\u8bcd\u6c47\u91cd\u53e0\uff08\u5982ROUGE\uff09\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e3b\u89c2\u7684LLM-as-a-Judge\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u90fd\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e34\u5e8a\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u521b\u5efaLiveMedBench\uff1a\u6301\u7eed\u66f4\u65b0\u3001\u65e0\u6c61\u67d3\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6bcf\u5468\u4ece\u5728\u7ebf\u533b\u7597\u793e\u533a\u6536\u96c6\u771f\u5b9e\u4e34\u5e8a\u75c5\u4f8b\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u79bb\uff1b2\uff09\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b5b\u9009\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u8fc7\u6ee4\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5faa\u8bc1\u533b\u5b66\u539f\u5219\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff1b3\uff09\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc4\u5206\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5c06\u533b\u751f\u56de\u7b54\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u75c5\u4f8b\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6bd4LLM-as-a-Judge\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "LiveMedBench\u5305\u542b2,756\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u75c5\u4f8b\uff0c\u6db5\u76d638\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u4e13\u4e1a\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u914d\u670916,702\u4e2a\u72ec\u7279\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u3002\u5bf938\u4e2aLLMs\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u8fbe\u523039.2%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b84%\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u622a\u6b62\u65e5\u671f\u540e\u7684\u75c5\u4f8b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u666e\u904d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u98ce\u9669\uff1b\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e35-48%\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6e90\u4e8e\u65e0\u6cd5\u5c06\u533b\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u9002\u5e94\u60a3\u8005\u7279\u5b9a\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u60c5\u5883\u5e94\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "LiveMedBench\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u533b\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4e3aLLMs\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u6807\u51c6\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u666e\u904d\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51faLLMs\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u4e0d\u662f\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5c06\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5177\u4f53\u60a3\u8005\u60c5\u5883\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Recently, reasoning in continuous latent space has emerged as a promising alternative, enabling more robust inference and flexible computation beyond discrete token constraints. However, current latent paradigms often suffer from feature collapse and instability, stemming from distribution mismatches when recurrently using hidden states as the input embeddings, or alignment issues when relying on assistant models. To address this, we propose Latent Thoughts Tuning (LT-Tuning), a framework that redefines how latent thoughts are constructed and deployed. Instead of relying solely on raw hidden states, our method introduces a Context-Prediction-Fusion mechanism that jointly leveraging contextual hidden states and predictive semantic guidance from the vocabulary embedding space. Combined with a progressive three-stage curriculum learning pipeline, LT-Tuning also enables dynamically switching between latent and explicit thinking modes. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing latent reasoning baselines, effectively mitigating feature collapse and achieving robust reasoning accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "LT-Tuning\u901a\u8fc7Context-Prediction-Fusion\u673a\u5236\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6f5c\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5d29\u6e83\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u663e\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe(CoT)\u9700\u8981\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u6587\u672c\u6807\u8bb0\u8868\u8fbe\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u601d\u7ef4\u9650\u5236\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u8bcd\u6c47\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u3002\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u5d29\u6e83\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u9012\u5f52\u4f7f\u7528\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\u5d4c\u5165\u65f6\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u8f85\u52a9\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLatent Thoughts Tuning (LT-Tuning)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Context-Prediction-Fusion\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u8bcd\u6c47\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u8bed\u4e49\u6307\u5bfc\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u6f5c\u601d\u7ef4\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u539f\u59cb\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6f5c\u601d\u7ef4\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5207\u6362\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6f5c\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LT-Tuning\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u6f5c\u601d\u7ef4\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

The transition from competition-level problem-solving to professional research, however, requires navigating vast literature and constructing long-horizon proofs. In this work, we introduce Aletheia, a math research agent that iteratively generates, verifies, and revises solutions end-to-end in natural language. Specifically, Aletheia is powered by an advanced version of Gemini Deep Think for challenging reasoning problems, a novel inference-time scaling law that extends beyond Olympiad-level problems, and intensive tool use to navigate the complexities of mathematical research. We demonstrate the capability of Aletheia from Olympiad problems to PhD-level exercises and most notably, through several distinct milestones in AI-assisted mathematics research: (a) a research paper (Feng26) generated by AI without any human intervention in calculating certain structure constants in arithmetic geometry called eigenweights; (b) a research paper (LeeSeo26) demonstrating human-AI collaboration in proving bounds on systems of interacting particles called independent sets; and (c) an extensive semi-autonomous evaluation (Feng et al., 2026a) of 700 open problems on Bloom's Erdos Conjectures database, including autonomous solutions to four open questions. In order to help the public better understand the developments pertaining to AI and mathematics, we suggest codifying standard levels quantifying autonomy and novelty of AI-assisted results.

However, most existing methods focus only on the visual modality and compute prototypes directly from raw support images, which lack comprehensive and rich multimodal information. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Multimodal Prototype Augmentation FSL framework called MPA, including LLM-based Multi-Variant Semantic Enhancement (LMSE), Hierarchical Multi-View Augmentation (HMA), and an Adaptive Uncertain Class Absorber (AUCA). LMSE leverages large language models to generate diverse paraphrased category descriptions, enriching the support set with additional semantic cues. HMA exploits both natural and multi-view augmentations to enhance feature diversity (e.g., changes in viewing distance, camera angles, and lighting conditions). AUCA models uncertainty by introducing uncertain classes via interpolation and Gaussian sampling, effectively absorbing uncertain samples. Extensive experiments on four single-domain and six cross-domain FSL benchmarks demonstrate that MPA achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods across most settings. Notably, MPA surpasses the second-best method by 12.29% and 24.56% in the single-domain and cross-domain setting, respectively, in the 5-way 1-shot setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMPA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u589e\u5f3a\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u7c7b\u5438\u6536\uff0c\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u652f\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6027\u80fd", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMPA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1) LLM\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u8bed\u4e49\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7c7b\u522b\u63cf\u8ff0\uff1b2) \u5206\u5c42\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u548c\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u589e\u5f3a\u589e\u52a0\u7279\u5f81\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff1b3) \u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u7c7b\u5438\u6536\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d2\u503c\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u91c7\u6837\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u7c7b", "result": "\u57284\u4e2a\u5355\u57df\u548c6\u4e2a\u8de8\u57df\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMPA\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u57285-way 1-shot\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u5355\u57df\u548c\u8de8\u57df\u5206\u522b\u6bd4\u7b2c\u4e8c\u540d\u9ad8\u51fa12.29%\u548c24.56%", "conclusion": "MPA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u5f81\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa"}}

We compared two neural density estimators: one using handcrafted summary statistics and one using a summary network trained in combination with the neural density estimator. The summary network yielded a more focused posterior and generated posterior predictive traces that accurately captured the membrane potential dynamics. When using handcrafted summary statistics, posterior predictive traces match the included features but show deviations in the exact dynamics.

We propose using a single call to a generic 8B-parameter LLM for query reformulation, bridging the gap between ill-formed ToT queries and specific information needs. This method is particularly effective where standard Pseudo-Relevance Feedback fails due to poor initial recall. Crucially, our LLM is not fine-tuned for ToT or specific domains, demonstrating that gains stem from our prompting strategy rather than model specialization. Rewritten queries feed a multi-stage pipeline: sparse retrieval (BM25), dense/late-interaction reranking (Contriever, E5-large-v2, ColBERTv2), monoT5 cross-encoding, and list-wise reranking (Qwen 2.5 72B). Experiments on 2025 TREC-ToT datasets show that while raw queries yield poor performance, our lightweight pre-retrieval transformation improves Recall by 20.61%. Subsequent reranking improves nDCG@10 by 33.88%, MRR by 29.92%, and MAP@10 by 29.98%, offering a cost-effective intervention that unlocks the potential of downstream rankers.

Submitted and Accepted to the WSESE 2026 ICSE Workshop", "summary": "The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) has drawn growing interest within the scientific community. LLMs can handle large volumes of textual data and support methods for evidence synthesis. Although recent studies highlight the potential of LLMs to accelerate screening and data extraction steps in systematic reviews, detailed reports of their practical application throughout the entire process remain scarce. This paper presents an experience report on the conduction of a systematic mapping study with the support of LLMs, describing the steps followed, the necessary adjustments, and the main challenges faced. Positive aspects are discussed, such as (i) the significant reduction of time in repetitive tasks and (ii) greater standardization in data extraction, as well as negative aspects, including (i) considerable effort to build reliable well-structured prompts, especially for less experienced users, since achieving effective prompts may require several iterations and testing, which can partially offset the expected time savings, (ii) the occurrence of hallucinations, and (iii) the need for constant manual verification. As a contribution, this work offers lessons learned and practical recommendations for researchers interested in adopting LLMs in systematic mappings and reviews, highlighting both efficiency gains and methodological risks and limitations to be considered.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u62a5\u544a\u4e86\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6620\u5c04\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86LLM\u5728\u52a0\u901f\u91cd\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u9760\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3001\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u4ee5\u53ca\u9700\u8981\u6301\u7eed\u4eba\u5de5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1LLM\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0\u7684\u7b5b\u9009\u548c\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u53d6\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u52a0\u901f\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5173\u4e8e\u5176\u5728\u5b8c\u6574\u7814\u7a76\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u62a5\u544a\u4ecd\u7136\u7a00\u7f3a\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9645\u7ecf\u9a8c\u62a5\u544a\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u7ecf\u9a8c\u62a5\u544a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be6\u7ec6\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6620\u5c04\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528LLM\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6b65\u9aa4\u3001\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u8c03\u6574\u63aa\u65bd\u4ee5\u53ca\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9645\u6848\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86LLM\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u91cd\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u52aa\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u7528\u6237\uff1b\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u5e76\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u53ef\u80fd\u90e8\u5206\u62b5\u6d88\u9884\u671f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8282\u7701\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6620\u5c04\u548c\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528LLM\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5efa\u8bae\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6559\u8bad\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u5efa\u8bae\u5728\u91c7\u7528LLM\u65f6\u5e73\u8861\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

However, RL suffers from sample inefficiency and a lack of semantic interpretability in complex scenarios. Foundation Models, particularly Vision-Language Models (VLMs), can mitigate this by offering rich, context-aware knowledge, yet their high inference latency hinders deployment in high-frequency RL training loops. To bridge this gap, we present Found-RL, a platform tailored to efficiently enhance RL for AD using foundation models. A core innovation is the asynchronous batch inference framework, which decouples heavy VLM reasoning from the simulation loop, effectively resolving latency bottlenecks to support real-time learning. We introduce diverse supervision mechanisms: Value-Margin Regularization (VMR) and Advantage-Weighted Action Guidance (AWAG) to effectively distill expert-like VLM action suggestions into the RL policy. Additionally, we adopt high-throughput CLIP for dense reward shaping. We address CLIP's dynamic blindness via Conditional Contrastive Action Alignment, which conditions prompts on discretized speed/command and yields a normalized, margin-based bonus from context-specific action-anchor scoring. Found-RL provides an end-to-end pipeline for fine-tuned VLM integration and shows that a lightweight RL model can achieve near-VLM performance compared with billion-parameter VLMs while sustaining real-time inference (approx. 500 FPS).

Existing eviction or compression methods reduce cost but rely on heuristics, such as recency or past attention scores, which serve only as indirect proxies for a token's future utility and introduce computational overhead. We reframe KV cache eviction as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem: learning to rank tokens by their predicted usefulness for future decoding. To this end, we introduce KV Policy (KVP), a framework of lightweight per-head RL agents trained on pre-computed generation traces using only key and value vectors. Each agent learns a specialized eviction policy guided by future utility, which evaluates the quality of the ranking across all cache budgets, requiring no modifications to the underlying LLM or additional inference. Evaluated across two different model families on the long-context benchmark RULER and the multi-turn dialogue benchmark OASST2-4k, KVP significantly outperforms baselines. Furthermore, zero-shot tests on standard downstream tasks (e.g., LongBench, BOOLQ, ARC) indicate that KVP generalizes well beyond its training distribution and to longer context lengths.

However, current evaluation frameworks lack a consensus metric and suffer from two critical flaws: they often assume independence across time steps or variables, and they demonstrably lack sensitivity to tail events, the very occurrences that are most pivotal in real-world decision-making. To address these limitations, we propose two kernel-based metrics: the signature maximum mean discrepancy (Sig-MMD) and our novel censored Sig-MMD (CSig-MMD). By leveraging the signature kernel, these metrics capture complex inter-variate and inter-temporal dependencies and remain robust to missing data. Furthermore, CSig-MMD introduces a censoring scheme that prioritizes a forecaster's capability to predict tail events while strictly maintaining properness, a vital property for a good scoring rule. These metrics enable a more reliable evaluation of direct multi-step forecasting, facilitating the development of more robust probabilistic algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6838\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08Sig-MMD\u548cCSig-MMD\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u5c3e\u90e8\u4e8b\u4ef6\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a1\uff09\u5047\u8bbe\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u6216\u53d8\u91cf\u95f4\u72ec\u7acb\uff1b2\uff09\u5bf9\u5c3e\u90e8\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u3002\u800c\u5c3e\u90e8\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u6700\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b7e\u540d\u6838\uff08signature kernel\uff09\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u7b7e\u540d\u6700\u5927\u5747\u503c\u5dee\u5f02\uff08Sig-MMD\uff09\u548c\u65b0\u7684\u622a\u65adSig-MMD\uff08CSig-MMD\uff09\u3002CSig-MMD\u5f15\u5165\u622a\u65ad\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u8bc4\u4f30\u5c3e\u90e8\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8bc4\u5206\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u9002\u5f53\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u7f3a\u5931\u6570\u636e\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u76f4\u63a5\u591a\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6982\u7387\u7b97\u6cd5\u5f00\u53d1\u3002", "conclusion": "Sig-MMD\u548cCSig-MMD\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u3001\u66f4\u654f\u611f\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u5c3e\u90e8\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

The outcome of a centralized admission mechanism is then usually obtained by the Deferred Acceptance (DA) algorithm with random tie-breaking. Therefore, every possible outcome of this mechanism is a stable solution for the coarse priorities that will arise with certain probability. This implies a probabilistic assignment, where the admission probability for each student-school pair is specified. In this paper, we propose a new efficiency-improving stable `smart lottery' mechanism. We aim to improve the probabilistic assignment ex-ante in a stochastic dominance sense, while ensuring that the improved random matching is still ex-post stable, meaning that it can be decomposed into stable matchings regarding the original coarse priorities. Therefore, this smart lottery mechanism can provide a clear Pareto-improvement in expectation for any cardinal utilities compared to the standard DA with lottery solution, without sacrificing the stability of the final outcome. We show that although the underlying computational problem is NP-hard, we can solve the problem by using advanced optimization techniques such as integer programming with column generation. We conduct computational experiments on generated and real instances. Our results show that the welfare gains by our mechanism are substantially larger than the expected gains by standard methods that realize efficiency improvements after ties have already been broken.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\"\u667a\u80fd\u62bd\u7b7e\"\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u6539\u8fdb\u5b66\u6821\u5206\u914d\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u968f\u673a\u5e73\u5c40\u6253\u7834\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u63a5\u53d7\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6539\u8fdb", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5b66\u6821\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\u4f7f\u7528\u5ef6\u8fdf\u63a5\u53d7\u7b97\u6cd5\u52a0\u968f\u673a\u5e73\u5c40\u6253\u7834\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7a33\u5b9a\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u4f46\u5206\u914d\u7ed3\u679c\u5b58\u5728\u6548\u7387\u635f\u5931\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u7ec8\u5339\u914d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4ece\u671f\u671b\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u914d\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\"\u667a\u80fd\u62bd\u7b7e\"\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u6982\u7387\u5206\u914d\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5728\u968f\u673a\u5360\u4f18\u610f\u4e49\u4e0a\u6539\u8fdb\u5206\u914d\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u6539\u8fdb\u540e\u7684\u968f\u673a\u5339\u914d\u53ef\u4ee5\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u539f\u59cb\u7c97\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u5339\u914d\u3002\u867d\u7136\u8ba1\u7b97\u95ee\u9898\u662fNP\u96be\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u4f7f\u7528\u6574\u6570\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u5217\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u9ad8\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u798f\u5229\u589e\u76ca\u663e\u8457\u5927\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5728\u5e73\u5c40\u6253\u7834\u540e\u5b9e\u73b0\u6548\u7387\u6539\u8fdb\uff09\u3002\u667a\u80fd\u62bd\u7b7e\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u4e3a\u4efb\u4f55\u57fa\u6570\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u63d0\u4f9b\u660e\u786e\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6539\u8fdb\u671f\u671b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u667a\u80fd\u62bd\u7b7e\u673a\u5236\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6700\u7ec8\u7ed3\u679c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b66\u6821\u5206\u914d\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u968f\u673a\u5e73\u5c40\u6253\u7834\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u63a5\u53d7\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

We demonstrate that these heads are causal to model performance; masking them leads to significant degradation. Leveraging this discovery, we propose VERA (Visual Evidence Retrieval Augmentation), a training-free framework that detects model uncertainty (i.e., entropy) to trigger the explicit verbalization of visual evidence attended by VER heads.

Curriculum learning has proven to be effective in this setting, as it introduces complexity progressively. However, designing effective curricula is labor-intensive and requires extensive domain expertise. LLM-based curriculum generation has only recently emerged as a potential solution, but was limited to operate in static, offline modes without leveraging real-time feedback from the optimizer. Here we propose an interactive LLM-assisted framework for online curriculum generation, where the LLM adaptively designs training cases based on real-time feedback from the evolutionary optimization process. We investigate how different feedback modalities, ranging from numeric metrics alone to combinations with plots and behavior visualizations, influence the LLM ability to generate meaningful curricula. Through a 2D robot navigation case study, tackled with genetic programming as optimizer, we evaluate our approach against static LLM-generated curricula and expert-designed baselines. We show that interactive curriculum generation outperforms static approaches, with multimodal feedback incorporating both progression plots and behavior visualizations yielding performance competitive with expert-designed curricula. This work contributes to understanding how LLMs can serve as interactive curriculum designers for embodied AI systems, with potential extensions to broader evolutionary robotics applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0fLLM\u8f85\u52a9\u5728\u7ebf\u8bfe\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65f6\u8fdb\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u53cd\u9988\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bad\u7ec3\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u53cd\u9988\uff08\u8fdb\u5ea6\u56fe+\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\uff09\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bfe\u7a0b", "motivation": "\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u7b56\u7565\u641c\u7d22\u9700\u8981\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u6548\u4f46\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u9700\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u73b0\u6709LLM\u8bfe\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u79bb\u7ebf\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5b9e\u65f6\u53cd\u9988", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0fLLM\u8f85\u52a9\u5728\u7ebf\u8bfe\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0cLLM\u6839\u636e\u8fdb\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08\u9057\u4f20\u7f16\u7a0b\uff09\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bad\u7ec3\u6848\u4f8b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u53cd\u9988\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u6570\u503c\u6307\u6807\u3001\u56fe\u8868\u3001\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\uff09\u5bf9LLM\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd", "result": "\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u8bfe\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8fdb\u5ea6\u56fe\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u53cd\u9988\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bfe\u7a0b\u76f8\u5f53\u3002\u901a\u8fc72D\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1", "conclusion": "LLM\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\u7528\u4e8e\u5177\u8eabAI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b9e\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\u662f\u63d0\u5347LLM\u8bfe\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5173\u952e"}}

While recent POI recommendation approaches based on SIDs have achieved promising, they struggle in complex, sparse real-world environments due to two key limitations: (1) inadequate modeling of high-quality SIDs that capture cross-category spatio-temporal collaborative relationships, and (2) poor alignment between large language models (LLMs) and the POI recommendation task. To this end, we propose GeoGR, a geographic generative recommendation framework tailored for navigation-based LBS like AMAP, which perceives users' contextual state changes and enables intent-aware POI recommendation. GeoGR features a two-stage design: (i) a geo-aware SID tokenization pipeline that explicitly learns spatio-temporal collaborative semantic representations via geographically constrained co-visited POI pairs, contrastive learning, and iterative refinement; and (ii) a multi-stage LLM training strategy that aligns non-native SID tokens through multiple template-based continued pre-training(CPT) and enables autoregressive POI generation via supervised fine-tuning(SFT). Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate GeoGR's superiority over state-of-the-art baselines.

However, existing code benchmarks primarily emphasize static correctness and implicitly assume fixed model capability during inference. As a result, they do not capture inference-time self-evolution, such as whether accuracy and efficiency improve as an agent iteratively refines its solutions. They also provide limited accounting of resource costs and rarely calibrate model performance against that of human programmers. Moreover, many benchmarks are dominated by high-resource languages, leaving cross-language robustness and long-tail language stability underexplored. Therefore, we present EvoCodeBench, a benchmark for evaluating self-evolving LLM-driven coding systems across programming languages with direct comparison to human performance. EvoCodeBench tracks performance dynamics, measuring solution correctness alongside efficiency metrics such as solving time, memory consumption, and improvement algorithmic design over repeated problem-solving attempts. To ground evaluation in a human-centered reference frame, we directly compare model performance with that of human programmers on the same tasks, enabling relative performance assessment within the human ability distribution. Furthermore, EvoCodeBench supports multiple programming languages, enabling systematic cross-language and long-tail stability analyses under a unified protocol. Our results demonstrate that self-evolving systems exhibit measurable gains in efficiency over time, and that human-relative and multi-language analyses provide insights unavailable through accuracy alone.

Using behavioral evaluations and causal-mechanistic experiments via functional localization methods inspired by cognitive neuroscience, we analyze LMs' performance across seven subcategories of ToM abilities (Beaudoin et al., 2020) on a substantially larger localizer dataset than used in prior like-minded work. Results from stringent hypothesis-driven statistical testing offer suggestive evidence for the functional integration hypothesis, indicating that LMs may develop interconnected \"social world models\" rather than isolated competencies.

By embedding states in the $Cl_{4,1}$ manifold and evolving them via geometric transformations (rotors), Versor natively represents $SE(3)$-equivariant relationships without requiring explicit structural encoding. Versor is validated on chaotic N-body dynamics, topological reasoning, and standard multimodal benchmarks (CIFAR-10, WikiText-103), consistently outperforming Transformers, Graph Networks, and geometric baselines (GATr, EGNN). Key results include: orders of magnitude fewer parameters ($200\\times$ vs. Transformers); interpretable attention decomposing into proximity and orientational components; zero-shot scale generalization (99.3% MCC on topology vs. 50.4% for ViT); and $O(L)$ linear complexity via the novel Recursive Rotor Accumulator. In out-of-distribution tests, Versor maintains stable predictions while Transformers fail catastrophically.

Sustaining such cooperation requires stability. When the core is empty, hospitals or countries may withhold easily matched pairs for internal use, creating incentive problems that undermine participation and reduce the scope and efficiency of exchange.\n  We propose a method to restore core stability by augmenting the platform with altruistic donors. Although the worst-case number of required altruists can be large, we show that in realistic settings only a small number is needed. We analyze two models of the compatibility graph, one based on random graphs and the other on compatibility types. When only pairwise exchanges are allowed, the number of required altruists is bounded by the maximum number of independent odd cycles, defined as disjoint odd cycles with no edges between them. This bound grows logarithmically with market size in the random graph model and is at most one third of the number of compatibility types in the type-based model.

This paradigm relies on Semantic IDs (SIDs) to tokenize large-scale items into discrete sequences. Existing GR approaches predominantly generate SIDs via Residual Quantization (RQ), where items are encoded into embeddings and then quantized to discrete SIDs. However, this paradigm suffers from inherent limitations: 1) Objective misalignment and semantic degradation stemming from the two-stage compression; 2) Error accumulation inherent in the structure of RQ. To address these limitations, we propose UniSID, a Unified SID generation framework for generative advertisement recommendation. Specifically, we jointly optimize embeddings and SIDs in an end-to-end manner from raw advertising data, enabling semantic information to flow directly into the SID space and thus addressing the inherent limitations of the two-stage cascading compression paradigm. To capture fine-grained semantics, a multi-granularity contrastive learning strategy is introduced to align distinct items across SID levels. Finally, a summary-based ad reconstruction mechanism is proposed to encourage SIDs to capture high-level semantic information that is not explicitly present in advertising contexts. Experiments demonstrate that UniSID consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SID generation methods, yielding up to a 4.62% improvement in Hit Rate metrics across downstream advertising scenarios compared to the strongest baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "UniSID\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bed\u4e49ID\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u8bed\u4e49ID\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u6b8b\u5dee\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u5e7f\u544a\u63a8\u8350\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u547d\u4e2d\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f7f\u7528\u6b8b\u5dee\u91cf\u5316\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49ID\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1\uff09\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u538b\u7f29\u5bfc\u81f4\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u9000\u5316\uff1b2\uff09\u6b8b\u5dee\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49ID\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u63a8\u8350\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUniSID\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u8bed\u4e49ID\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u5e7f\u544a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u4e49ID\u5c42\u7ea7\u7684\u9879\u76ee\uff1b3\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6458\u8981\u7684\u5e7f\u544a\u91cd\u5efa\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9f13\u52b1\u8bed\u4e49ID\u6355\u83b7\u5e7f\u544a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u672a\u660e\u786e\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u9ad8\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eUniSID\u5728\u5e7f\u544a\u63a8\u8350\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u4e49ID\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u5728\u547d\u4e2d\u7387\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe4.62%\u3002", "conclusion": "UniSID\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5e7f\u544a\u91cd\u5efa\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u8bed\u4e49ID\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Current evaluations systematically overlook the third goal. Specifically, they either treat existing code as ground truth (a compliance trap) for regression prevention, or depend on post-failure artifacts (e.g., issue reports) for bug reproduction-so they rarely surface defects before failures. To bridge this gap, we present TestExplora, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs as proactive testers within full-scale, realistic repository environments. TestExplora contains 2,389 tasks from 482 repositories and hides all defect-related signals. Models must proactively find bugs by comparing implementations against documentation-derived intent, using documentation as the oracle. Furthermore, to keep evaluation sustainable and reduce leakage, we propose continuous, time-aware data collection.

Inference-Time Scaling in Language Models as Adaptive Resource Rationality", "comment": null, "summary": "Human reasoning is shaped by resource rationality -- optimizing performance under constraints. Recently, inference-time scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm to improve the reasoning performance of Large Language Models by expanding test-time computation. Specifically, instruction-tuned (IT) models explicitly generate long reasoning steps during inference, whereas Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are trained by reinforcement learning to discover reasoning paths that maximize accuracy. However, it remains unclear whether resource-rationality can emerge from such scaling without explicit reward related to computational costs. We introduce a Variable Attribution Task in which models infer which variables determine outcomes given candidate variables, input-output trials, and predefined logical functions. By varying the number of candidate variables and trials, we systematically manipulate task complexity. Both models exhibit a transition from brute-force to analytic strategies as complexity increases. IT models degrade on XOR and XNOR functions, whereas LRMs remain robust. These findings suggest that models can adjust their reasoning behavior in response to task complexity, even without explicit cost-based reward.

Yet real platforms face finer-grained complexity: consumers differ in preferences and engagement patterns, producers vary in catalog value and capacity, and business objectives impose additional constraints beyond raw relevance. We formalize two-sided fairness under these realistic conditions, extending prior work from soft single-item allocations to discrete multi-item recommendations. We introduce Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) as a consumer-side objective that compresses group-level utility disparities, and integrate business constraints directly into the optimization. Our experiments reveal that the \"free fairness\" regime, where producer constraints impose no consumer cost, disappears in multi item settings. Strikingly, moderate fairness constraints can improve business metrics by diversifying exposure away from saturated producers. Scalable solvers match exact solutions at a fraction of the runtime, making fairness-aware allocation practical at scale.

In this work, we conduct a closed-loop evaluation of state-of-the-art autonomous driving agents under black-box adversarial threat models in CARLA.

Our experiments on two advanced agents, Transfuser and Interfuser, reveal severe vulnerabilities to such attacks, with driving scores dropping by up to 99% in the worst case, raising valid safety concerns. To help mitigate such threats, we further propose a lightweight Attack Detection model for Autonomous Driving systems (AD$^2$) based on attention mechanisms that capture spatial-temporal consistency.

While long-sequence models(e.g., LONGER) can reuse user-side computation through KV caching, such reuse is difficult in dense feature interaction architectures(e.g., RankMixer), where user and group (candidate item) features are deeply entangled across layers. In this work, we propose User-Group Separation (UG-Sep), a novel framework that enables reusable user-side computation in dense interaction models for the first time. UG-Sep introduces a masking mechanism that explicitly disentangles user-side and item-side information flows within token-mixing layers, ensuring that a subset of tokens to preserve purely user-side representations across layers. This design enables corresponding token computations to be reused across multiple samples, significantly reducing redundant inference cost. To compensate for potential expressiveness loss induced by masking, we further propose an Information Compensation strategy that adaptively reconstructs suppressed user-item interactions. Moreover, as UG-Sep substantially reduces user-side FLOPs and exposes memory-bound components, we incorporate W8A16 (8-bit weight, 16-bit activation) weight-only quantization to alleviate memory bandwidth bottlenecks and achieve additional acceleration. We conduct extensive offline evaluations and large-scale online A/B experiments at ByteDance, demonstrating that UG-Sep reduces inference latency by up to 20 percent without degrading online user experience or commercial metrics across multiple business scenarios, including feed recommendation and advertising systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faUG-Sep\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237-\u7ec4\u5206\u79bb\u673a\u5236\u5728\u7a20\u5bc6\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u7684\u7528\u6237\u4fa7\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4fe1\u606f\u8865\u507f\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u800c\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u63a8\u8350\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u6355\u83b7\u590d\u6742\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u4f46\u5e26\u6765\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7KV\u7f13\u5b58\u590d\u7528\u7528\u6237\u4fa7\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4f46\u7a20\u5bc6\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u5982RankMixer\uff09\u4e2d\u7528\u6237\u548c\u5019\u9009\u9879\u76ee\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u5c42\u95f4\u6df1\u5ea6\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u4f3c\u590d\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u6237-\u7ec4\u5206\u79bb\uff08UG-Sep\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u63a9\u7801\u673a\u5236\u5728token\u6df7\u5408\u5c42\u4e2d\u663e\u5f0f\u89e3\u8026\u7528\u6237\u4fa7\u548c\u9879\u76ee\u4fa7\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\uff0c\u4f7f\u90e8\u5206token\u4fdd\u6301\u7eaf\u7528\u6237\u4fa7\u8868\u793a\uff1b2\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\u8865\u507f\u7b56\u7565\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u5efa\u88ab\u6291\u5236\u7684\u7528\u6237-\u9879\u76ee\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b3\uff09\u7ed3\u5408W8A16\u4ec5\u6743\u91cd\u91cf\u5316\u7f13\u89e3\u5185\u5b58\u5e26\u5bbd\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b57\u8282\u8df3\u52a8\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5728\u7ebfA/B\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cUG-Sep\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4e1a\u52a1\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u63a8\u8350\u548c\u5e7f\u544a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff09\u4e2d\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u8fbe20%\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u5728\u7ebf\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u6216\u5546\u4e1a\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "UG-Sep\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u7a20\u5bc6\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u7684\u7528\u6237\u4fa7\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u3001\u8865\u507f\u4ea4\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u8350\u6548\u679c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This paper examines this transition by connecting foundational intelligent agent theories, including reactive, deliberative, and Belief-Desire-Intention models, with contemporary LLM-centric approaches such as tool invocation, memory-augmented reasoning, and multi-agent coordination. The paper presents three primary contributions: (i) a reference architecture for production-grade LLM agents that separates cognitive reasoning from execution using typed tool interfaces; (ii) a taxonomy of multi-agent topologies, together with their associated failure modes and mitigation approaches; and (iii) an enterprise hardening checklist that incorporates governance, observability, and reproducibility considerations. Through an analysis of emerging industry platforms, including Kore.ai, Salesforce Agentforce, TrueFoundry, ZenML, and LangChain, the study identifies a convergence toward standardized agent loops, registries, and auditable control mechanisms. It is argued that the subsequent phase of agentic AI development will parallel the maturation of web services, relying on shared protocols, typed contracts, and layered governance structures to support scalable and composable autonomy. The persistent challenges related to verifiability, interoperability, and safe autonomy remain key areas for future research and practical deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4ece\u9759\u6001\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5411\u81ea\u4e3b\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u751f\u4ea7\u7ea7LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u62d3\u6251\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7\u52a0\u56fa\u6e05\u5355\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u884c\u4e1a\u5e73\u53f0\u53d1\u5c55\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76AI\u4ece\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5411\u5177\u6709\u81ea\u4e3b\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u884c\u52a8\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u63a5\u7ecf\u5178\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u7406\u8bba\uff08\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u3001\u5ba1\u614e\u5f0f\u3001BDI\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u4e0e\u5f53\u4ee3LLM\u4e2d\u5fc3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u3001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u534f\u8c03\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u884c\u4e1a\u5e73\u53f0\uff08Kore.ai\u3001Salesforce Agentforce\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u8d21\u732e\uff1a1\uff09\u751f\u4ea7\u7ea7LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u67b6\u6784\uff1b2\uff09\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u62d3\u6251\u5206\u7c7b\u53ca\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b3\uff09\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7\u52a0\u56fa\u6e05\u5355\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u884c\u4e1a\u5411\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u5faa\u73af\u3001\u6ce8\u518c\u8868\u548c\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\u8d8b\u540c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ee3\u7406\u5f0fAI\u53d1\u5c55\u5c06\u7c7b\u4f3cWeb\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u6210\u719f\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u5171\u4eab\u534f\u8bae\u3001\u7c7b\u578b\u5316\u5951\u7ea6\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u6cbb\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3002\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u3001\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u4ecd\u662f\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Recent work introduces dynamic vocabulary by sampling retrieved text spans but overlooks that the same sentence can be composed of spans of varying lengths, lacking explicit modeling of the directed acyclic graph (DAG) state space. This leads to restricted exploration of compositional paths and is biased toward the chosen path. Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are powerful for efficient exploring and generalizing over state spaces, particularly those with a DAG structure. However, prior GFlowNets-based language models operate at the token level and remain confined to tree-structured spaces, limiting their potential. In this work, we propose Flow of SpanS (FOSS), a principled GFlowNets framework for span generation. FoSS constructs a dynamic span vocabulary by segmenting the retrieved text flexibly, ensuring a DAG-structured state space, which allows GFlowNets to explore diverse compositional paths and improve generalization. With specialized reward models, FoSS generates diverse, high-quality text. Empirically, FoSS improves MAUVE scores by up to 12.5% over Transformer on text generation and achieves 3.5% gains on knowledge-intensive tasks, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Scaling experiments further demonstrate FoSS benefits from larger models, more data, and richer retrieval corpora, retaining its advantage over strong baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "FoSS\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eGFlowNets\u7684\u8de8\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8de8\u5ea6\u8bcd\u6c47\u548cDAG\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u63d0\u5347\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u8d28\u91cf", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u6811\u72b6\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u52a8\u6001\u8bcd\u6c47\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u5f15\u5165\u68c0\u7d22\u6587\u672c\u8de8\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u540c\u4e00\u53e5\u5b50\u53ef\u7531\u4e0d\u540c\u957f\u5ea6\u8de8\u5ea6\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9DAG\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ec4\u5408\u8def\u5f84\u63a2\u7d22\u53d7\u9650\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFlow of SpanS (FoSS)\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u901a\u8fc7\u7075\u6d3b\u5206\u5272\u68c0\u7d22\u6587\u672c\u6784\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u8de8\u5ea6\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\uff1b2) \u786e\u4fddDAG\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b3) \u5229\u7528GFlowNets\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u6837\u7ec4\u5408\u8def\u5f84\uff1b4) \u7ed3\u5408\u4e13\u7528\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6587\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cFoSS\u76f8\u6bd4Transformer\u63d0\u5347MAUVE\u5206\u6570\u8fbe12.5%\uff1b\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f973.5%\u589e\u76ca\uff1b\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6269\u5c55\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eFoSS\u80fd\u4ece\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u66f4\u591a\u6570\u636e\u548c\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u68c0\u7d22\u8bed\u6599\u4e2d\u83b7\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "FoSS\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06GFlowNets\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8de8\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u6784\u5efaDAG\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

Respect is a central dimension of these interactions, shaping public trust and perceived legitimacy, yet its interpretation is inherently subjective and shaped by lived experience, rendering community-specific perspectives a critical consideration. Leveraging unprecedented access to Los Angeles Police Department BWC footage, we introduce the first large-scale traffic-stop dataset annotated with respect ratings and free-text rationales from multiple perspectives. By sampling annotators from police-affiliated, justice-system-impacted, and non-affiliated Los Angeles residents, we enable the systematic study of perceptual differences across diverse communities. To this end, we (i) develop a domain-specific evaluation rubric grounded in procedural justice theory, LAPD training materials, and extensive fieldwork; (ii) introduce a rubric-driven preference data construction framework for perspective-consistent alignment; and (iii) propose a perspective-aware modeling framework that predicts personalized respect ratings and generates annotator-specific rationales for both officers and civilian drivers from traffic-stop transcripts. Across all three annotator groups, our approach improves both rating prediction performance and rationale alignment. Our perspective-aware framework enables law enforcement to better understand diverse community expectations, providing a vital tool for building public trust and procedural legitimacy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9996\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4ea4\u901a\u62e6\u622a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5c0a\u91cd\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u7406\u7531\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u793e\u533a\u5bf9\u8b66\u5bdf-\u5e73\u6c11\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u5dee\u5f02", "motivation": "\u4ea4\u901a\u62e6\u622a\u662f\u6700\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u8b66\u6c11\u4e92\u52a8\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u5c0a\u91cd\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u516c\u4f17\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u89e3\u91ca\u5177\u6709\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u4e14\u53d7\u751f\u6d3b\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u793e\u533a\u7279\u5b9a\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u7814\u7a76", "method": "1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6b63\u4e49\u7406\u8bba\u3001LAPD\u57f9\u8bad\u6750\u6599\u548c\u5b9e\u5730\u8c03\u67e5\u5f00\u53d1\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\uff1b2) \u5f15\u5165\u6807\u51c6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff1b3) \u63d0\u51fa\u89c6\u89d2\u611f\u77e5\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5c0a\u91cd\u8bc4\u5206\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u7279\u5b9a\u6ce8\u91ca\u8005\u7684\u7406\u7531", "result": "\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4e09\u4e2a\u6ce8\u91ca\u8005\u7fa4\u4f53\uff08\u8b66\u5bdf\u76f8\u5173\u3001\u53f8\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u3001\u975e\u5173\u8054\u5c45\u6c11\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bc4\u5206\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7406\u7531\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u89d2\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u6267\u6cd5\u90e8\u95e8\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u793e\u533a\u7684\u671f\u671b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5efa\u7acb\u516c\u4f17\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177"}}

For a single attention head, shared random softmax weights couple different width coordinates and induce non-Gaussian field statistics that persist in the infinite-width limit $d_k\\to\\infty$. We compute the two-point function in an attention-weight representation and show how Euclidean-invariant kernels can be engineered via random-feature token embeddings. We then analyze the connected four-point function and identify an \"independence-breaking\" contribution, expressible as a covariance over query-key weights, which remains finite at infinite width. Finally, we show that summing many independent heads with standard $1/N_h$ normalization suppresses connected non-Gaussian correlators as $1/N_h$, yielding a Gaussian NN-QFT in the large-head limit.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6784\u9020\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u6807\u91cf\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7NN-QFT\u6846\u67b6\u5b9a\u4e49n\u70b9\u5173\u8054\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u5355\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u5bbd\u5ea6\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u4ea7\u751f\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u7edf\u8ba1\uff0c\u591a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u6c42\u548c\u5728\u5927\u5934\u6570\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u6062\u590d\u9ad8\u65af\u573a\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u4eceTransformer\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u6784\u9020\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528NN-QFT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u7f51\u7edc\u53c2\u6570\u5e73\u5747\u5b9a\u4e49\u5173\u8054\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u5206\u6790\u5355\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u5bbd\u5ea6\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u7684\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u7edf\u8ba1\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e24\u70b9\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u56db\u70b9\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u6c42\u548c\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5355\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u5bbd\u5ea6\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u7edf\u8ba1\uff0c\u56db\u70b9\u51fd\u6570\u5b58\u5728\"\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u7834\u574f\"\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u591a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u6c42\u548c\u4ee51/N_h\u56e0\u5b50\u6291\u5236\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u5173\u8054\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u5934\u6570\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u6062\u590d\u9ad8\u65afNN-QFT\u3002", "conclusion": "Transformer\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u53ef\u4ee5\u6784\u9020\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\uff0c\u5355\u5934\u4ea7\u751f\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u7edf\u8ba1\uff0c\u591a\u5934\u6c42\u548c\u6062\u590d\u9ad8\u65af\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Recent work has introduced the paradigm of near-feasibility in capacitated matching settings, where agent capacities are slightly modified to ensure the existence of desirable outcomes. While useful when no stable matching exists, or some agents are left unmatched, it has not previously been investigated whether near-feasible stable matchings satisfy desirable properties with regard to their stability in the original instance. Furthermore, prior works often leave open deviation incentive issues that arise when the centralised authority modifies agents' capacities.\n  We consider these issues in the Stable Fixtures problem model, which generalises many classical models through non-bipartite preferences and capacitated agents. We develop a formal framework to analyse and quantify agent incentives to adhere to computed matchings. Then, we embed near-feasible stable matchings in this framework and study the trade-offs between instability, capacity modifications, and computational complexity. We prove that capacity modifications can be simultaneously optimal at individual and aggregate levels, and provide efficient algorithms to compute them. We show that different modification strategies significantly affect stability, and establish that minimal modifications and minimal deviation incentives are compatible and efficiently computable under general conditions. Finally, we provide exact algorithms and experimental results for tractable and intractable versions of these problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u5339\u914d\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u5bb9\u91cf\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1\u53ef\u884c\u7a33\u5b9a\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5bb9\u91cf\u8c03\u6574\u5bf9\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u5bb9\u91cf\u8c03\u6574\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f53\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u5339\u914d\u6216\u90e8\u5206\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u65e0\u6cd5\u5339\u914d\u65f6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5bb9\u91cf\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1\u53ef\u884c\u5339\u914d\u3002\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1) \u8c03\u6574\u540e\u7684\u5339\u914d\u5728\u539f\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1f2) \u5bb9\u91cf\u8c03\u6574\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u53d1\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u504f\u79bb\u5339\u914d\u7684\u6fc0\u52b1\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6fc0\u52b1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u88c5\u7f6e\u95ee\u9898\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u504f\u79bb\u8ba1\u7b97\u5339\u914d\u7684\u6fc0\u52b1\u3002\u5c06\u8fd1\u53ef\u884c\u7a33\u5b9a\u5339\u914d\u5d4c\u5165\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u5bb9\u91cf\u8c03\u6574\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u5bb9\u91cf\u8c03\u6574\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u5bb9\u91cf\u8c03\u6574\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e2a\u4f53\u548c\u603b\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u540c\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u8c03\u6574\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u6700\u5c0f\u5bb9\u91cf\u8c03\u6574\u4e0e\u6700\u5c0f\u504f\u79bb\u6fc0\u52b1\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u517c\u5bb9\u4e14\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\uff1b\u4e3a\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u548c\u96be\u5904\u7406\u7248\u672c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cbe\u786e\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u8fd1\u53ef\u884c\u7a33\u5b9a\u5339\u914d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6fc0\u52b1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5bb9\u91cf\u8c03\u6574\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b66\u6821\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u5c31\u4e1a\u5e02\u573a\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5339\u914d\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

However, most existing approaches still rely on fixed workflows, applying the same reasoning procedure across diverse recommendation scenarios. In practice, user contexts vary substantially-for example, in cold-start settings or during interest shifts, so an agent should adaptively decide what evidence to gather next rather than following a scripted process. To address this, we propose ChainRec, an agentic recommender that uses a planner to dynamically select reasoning tools. ChainRec builds a standardized Tool Agent Library from expert trajectories.

Based on the learned symbolic model of states, NSAM learns action masks that rules out infeasible actions.

Existing truncation-based samplers are effective but largely heuristic, relying mainly on probability mass and entropy while ignoring semantic geometry of the token space. We present Top-W, a geometry-aware truncation rule that uses Wasserstein distance-defined over token-embedding geometry-to keep the cropped distribution close to the original, while explicitly balancing retained probability mass against the entropy of the kept set. Our theory yields a simple closed-form structure for the fixed-potential subset update: depending on the mass-entropy trade-off, the optimal crop either collapses to a single token or takes the form of a one-dimensional prefix that can be found efficiently with a linear scan. We implement Top-W using efficient geometry-based potentials (nearest-set or k-NN) and pair it with an alternating decoding routine that keeps the standard truncation-and-sampling interface unchanged.

A Benchmarking Framework for Multi-Hop Inference over Hybrid Knowledge", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) continue to struggle with knowledge-intensive questions that require up-to-date information and multi-hop reasoning. Augmenting LLMs with hybrid external knowledge, such as unstructured text and structured knowledge graphs, offers a promising alternative to costly continual pretraining. As such, reliable evaluation of their retrieval and reasoning capabilities becomes critical. However, many existing benchmarks increasingly overlap with LLM pretraining data, which means answers or supporting knowledge may already be encoded in model parameters, making it difficult to distinguish genuine retrieval and reasoning from parametric recall. We introduce HybridRAG-Bench, a framework for constructing benchmarks to evaluate retrieval-intensive, multi-hop reasoning over hybrid knowledge. HybridRAG-Bench automatically couples unstructured text and structured knowledge graph representations derived from recent scientific literature on arXiv, and generates knowledge-intensive question-answer pairs grounded in explicit reasoning paths. The framework supports flexible domain and time-frame selection, enabling contamination-aware and customizable evaluation as models and knowledge evolve. Experiments across three domains (artificial intelligence, governance and policy, and bioinformatics) demonstrate that HybridRAG-Bench rewards genuine retrieval and reasoning rather than parametric recall, offering a principled testbed for evaluating hybrid knowledge-augmented reasoning systems.

We ask whether weakening optimality to the requirement that each player merely avoid worst responses -- arguably the weakest meaningful rationality criterion -- yields tractable solution concepts. We show that it does not: any solution concept with this minimal guarantee is ``as intractable'' as pure Nash equilibrium. In general games, determining the existence of no-worst-response action profiles is NP-complete, finding one is NP-hard, and counting them is #P-complete. In potential games, where existence is guaranteed, the search problem is PLS-complete. Computational intractability therefore stems not only from the requirement of optimality, but also from the requirement of a minimal rationality guarantee for each player.

While this paradigm greatly expands usability, it also introduces a critical and underexplored safety risk: the attack surface itself becomes visual. In this work, we propose Vision-Centric Jailbreak Attack (VJA), the first visual-to-visual jailbreak attack that conveys malicious instructions purely through visual inputs. To systematically study this emerging threat, we introduce IESBench, a safety-oriented benchmark for image editing models. Extensive experiments on IESBench demonstrate that VJA effectively compromises state-of-the-art commercial models, achieving attack success rates of up to 80.9% on Nano Banana Pro and 70.1% on GPT-Image-1.5. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose a training-free defense based on introspective multimodal reasoning, which substantially improves the safety of poorly aligned models to a level comparable with commercial systems, without auxiliary guard models and with negligible computational overhead. Our findings expose new vulnerabilities, provide both a benchmark and practical defense to advance safe and trustworthy modern image editing systems.

Prior research has explored the modeling of user preferences through sequential interactions and the user-item interaction graph, utilizing advanced techniques such as graph neural networks and transformer-based architectures. However, these methods typically fall short in simultaneously accounting for the dynamic nature of graph topologies and the sequential pattern of interactions in user preference models. Moreover, they often fail to adequately capture the multiple user behavior boundaries during model optimization. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a boundary-aware Multi-Behavioral Dynamic Graph Transformer (MB-DGT) model that dynamically refines the graph structure to reflect the evolving patterns of user behaviors and interactions. Our model involves a transformer-based dynamic graph aggregator for user preference modeling, which assimilates the changing graph structure and the sequence of user behaviors. This integration yields a more comprehensive and dynamic representation of user preferences. For model optimization, we implement a user-specific multi-behavior loss function that delineates the interest boundaries among different behaviors, thereby enriching the personalized learning of user preferences. Comprehensive experiments across three datasets indicate that our model consistently delivers remarkable recommendation performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "MB-DGT\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u548c\u591a\u884c\u4e3a\u8fb9\u754c\u611f\u77e5\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u6355\u6349\u591a\u884c\u4e3a\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8fb9\u754c\u611f\u77e5\u591a\u884c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u53d8\u6362\u5668(MB-DGT)\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u805a\u5408\u5668\u6765\u6574\u5408\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u7528\u6237\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u591a\u884c\u4e3a\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u884c\u4e3a\u8fb9\u754c", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u59cb\u7ec8\u63d0\u4f9b\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "MB-DGT\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u591a\u884c\u4e3a\u8fb9\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u679c"}}

We define troubleshooting as the cognitive problem-solving process of identifying, understanding, and constructing a mental model of the cause of an unexpected system behavior, and consider the cognitive process of troubleshooting to be an integral part of the activity of debugging. Troubleshooting is a particularly intense and draining aspect of software work, placing sustained demands on attention, working memory, and mental modeling. By surfacing and naming the confusion experience inherent in troubleshooting in terms of neurological and attentional dynamics, our theory explains how prolonged troubleshooting can deplete cognitive resources and lead to cognitive fatigue. In the study presented in this paper, we interview 27 professional developers about their troubleshooting experiences, and follow a Constructivist Grounded Theory approach to construct a theory grounded in empirical data.

Although recent progress in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) has boosted step-by-step inference in mathematics and coding, it is still underexplored whether this benefit transfers to socio-cognitive skills. We present a systematic study of nine advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), comparing reasoning models with non-reasoning models on three representative ToM benchmarks. The results show that reasoning models do not consistently outperform non-reasoning models and sometimes perform worse. A fine-grained analysis reveals three insights. First, slow thinking collapses: accuracy significantly drops as responses grow longer, and larger reasoning budgets hurt performance. Second, moderate and adaptive reasoning benefits performance: constraining reasoning length mitigates failure, while distinct success patterns demonstrate the necessity of dynamic adaptation. Third, option matching shortcut: when multiple choice options are removed, reasoning models improve markedly, indicating reliance on option matching rather than genuine deduction. We also design two intervention approaches: Slow-to-Fast (S2F) adaptive reasoning and Think-to-Match (T2M) shortcut prevention to further verify and mitigate the problems.

Diagnosing ASR Predictions in Sardinian via Layer-Wise Decoding", "comment": null, "summary": "Recent studies have shown that intermediate layers in multilingual speech models often encode more phonetically accurate representations than the final output layer. In this work, we apply a layer-wise decoding strategy to a pretrained Wav2Vec2 model to investigate how phoneme-level predictions evolve across encoder layers, focusing on Campidanese Sardinian, a low-resource language. We show that truncating upper transformer layers leads to improved Phoneme Error Rates (PER), with the best performance achieved not at the final layer, but two layers earlier. Through fine-grained alignment analysis, we find that intermediate predictions better preserve segmental identity, avoid overgeneration, and reduce certain classes of phonological errors. We also introduce the notion of regressive errors, cases where correct predictions at intermediate layers are overwritten by errors at the final layer. These regressions highlight the limitations of surface-level error metrics and reveal how deeper layers may generalize or abstract away from acoustic detail. Our findings support the use of early-layer probing as a diagnostic tool for ASR models, particularly in low-resource settings where standard evaluation metrics may fail to capture linguistically meaningful behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u6bd4\u6700\u7ec8\u8f93\u51fa\u5c42\u7f16\u7801\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u97f3\u7d20\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u53d1\u73b0\u622a\u65ad\u4e0a\u5c42Transformer\u5c42\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u97f3\u7d20\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u5012\u6570\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5c42\u800c\u975e\u6700\u7ec8\u5c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5c42\u7684\u97f3\u7d20\u9884\u6d4b\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff08Campidanese Sardinian\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e86\u89e3\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u662f\u5426\u6bd4\u6700\u7ec8\u5c42\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u97f3\u7d20\u8868\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684Wav2Vec2\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u5c42\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u97f3\u7d20\u7ea7\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5c42\u95f4\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u622a\u65ad\u4e0a\u5c42Transformer\u5c42\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u97f3\u7d20\u8eab\u4efd\u3001\u907f\u514d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u97f3\u7cfb\u9519\u8bef\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u622a\u65ad\u4e0a\u5c42Transformer\u5c42\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u97f3\u7d20\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u5012\u6570\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5c42\u800c\u975e\u6700\u7ec8\u5c42\uff1b\u4e2d\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4fdd\u6301\u97f3\u7d20\u8eab\u4efd\u3001\u907f\u514d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u97f3\u7cfb\u9519\u8bef\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u56de\u5f52\u9519\u8bef\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5373\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u6700\u7ec8\u5c42\u88ab\u9519\u8bef\u8986\u76d6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u7f16\u7801\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u97f3\u7d20\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6df1\u5c42\u53ef\u80fd\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u6216\u62bd\u8c61\u5316\u58f0\u5b66\u7ec6\u8282\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u5c06\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u63a2\u6d4b\u4f5c\u4e3aASR\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

Typically, blockchain protocols provide a timing buffer for block propagation across the network. In leader-based blockchains, the leader -- block proposer -- is known in advance for each slot. A fast (or low-latency) proposer may delay the block proposal in anticipation of more rewards from the transactions that would otherwise be included in the subsequent block. Deploying such a strategy by manipulating the timing is known as timing games. It increases the risk of missed blocks due to reduced time for other nodes to vote on the block, affecting the overall efficiency of the blockchain. Moreover, proposers who play timing games essentially appropriate MEV (additional rewards over transaction fees and the block reward) that would otherwise accrue to the next block, making it unfair to subsequent block proposers. We propose a double-block proposal mechanism, 2-Prop, to curtail timing games. 2-Prop selects two proposers per slot to propose blocks and confirms one of them. We design a reward-sharing policy for proposers based on how quickly their blocks propagate to avoid strategic deviations. In the induced game, which we call the Latency Game, we show that it is a Nash Equilibrium for the proposers to propose the block without delay under homogeneous network settings. Under heterogeneous network settings, we study many configurations, and our analysis shows that a faster proposer would prefer not to delay unless the other proposer is extremely slow. Thus, we show the efficacy of 2-Prop in mitigating the effect of timing games.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa2-Prop\u673a\u5236\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u535a\u5f08\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65f6\u9699\u9009\u62e9\u4e24\u4e2a\u63d0\u8bae\u8005\u6765\u63d0\u8bae\u533a\u5757\u5e76\u786e\u8ba4\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u533a\u5757\u4f20\u64ad\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5206\u4eab\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u4e2d\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5bfc\u81f4\u5feb\u901f\u63d0\u8bae\u8005\u53ef\u80fd\u6545\u610f\u5ef6\u8fdf\u533a\u5757\u63d0\u8bae\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u66f4\u591aMEV\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65f6\u5e8f\u535a\u5f08\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u9519\u8fc7\u533a\u5757\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u540e\u7eed\u533a\u5757\u63d0\u8bae\u8005\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba12-Prop\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65f6\u9699\u9009\u62e9\u4e24\u4e2a\u63d0\u8bae\u8005\u6765\u63d0\u8bae\u533a\u5757\uff0c\u53ea\u786e\u8ba4\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u533a\u5757\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u533a\u5757\u4f20\u64ad\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5206\u4eab\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f7f\u63d0\u8bae\u8005\u6ca1\u6709\u52a8\u673a\u8fdb\u884c\u6218\u7565\u504f\u79bb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\uff0c\u540c\u8d28\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u8bae\u8005\u4e0d\u5ef6\u8fdf\u63d0\u8bae\u662f\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u3002\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u9664\u975e\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u63d0\u8bae\u8005\u6781\u5176\u7f13\u6162\uff0c\u5426\u5219\u5feb\u901f\u63d0\u8bae\u8005\u4e0d\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "2-Prop\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u65f6\u5e8f\u535a\u5f08\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u91cd\u533a\u5757\u63d0\u8bae\u673a\u5236\u548c\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u63d0\u8bae\u8005\u64cd\u7eb5\u65f6\u5e8f\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u3002"}}

Since the DDPM prediction network relies on the U-net architecture, which is theoretically only translation equivariant, we introduce a geometric approach combined with an equivariance property of the more general Euclidean group, which includes rotations, reflections, and permutations. We introduce the notion of group morphological convolutions in Riemannian manifolds, which are derived from the viscosity solutions of first-order Hamilton-Jacobi-type partial differential equations (PDEs) that act as morphological multiscale dilations and erosions. We add a convection term to the model and solve it using the method of characteristics. This helps us better capture nonlinearities, represent thin geometric structures, and incorporate symmetries into the learning process.

However, generating these labels is challenging because campaigns use creative, thematic language that does not directly map to product purchases. Without clear product-level attribution, supervised learning for campaign optimization remains limited. We present \\textbf{Campaign-2-PT-RAG}, a scalable label generation framework that constructs user--campaign purchase labels by inferring which product types (PTs) each campaign promotes. The framework first interprets campaign content using large language models (LLMs) to capture implicit intent, then retrieves candidate PTs through semantic search over the platform taxonomy. A structured LLM-based classifier evaluates each PT's relevance, producing a campaign-specific product coverage set. User purchases matching these PTs generate positive training labels for downstream ranking models. This approach reframes the ambiguous attribution problem into a tractable semantic alignment task, enabling scalable and consistent supervision for downstream tasks such as campaign ranking optimization in production e-commerce environments.

However, evaluating these agents remains challenging due to the lack of standardized benchmarks and the risk of LLM-as-judge bias. We present ISD-Agent-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 25,795 scenarios generated via a Context Matrix framework that combines 51 contextual variables across 5 categories with 33 ISD sub-steps derived from the ADDIE model. To ensure evaluation reliability, we employ a multi-judge protocol using diverse LLMs from different providers, achieving high inter-judge reliability. We compare existing ISD agents with novel agents grounded in classical ISD theories such as ADDIE, Dick \\& Carey, and Rapid Prototyping ISD. Experiments on 1,017 test scenarios demonstrate that integrating classical ISD frameworks with modern ReAct-style reasoning achieves the highest performance, outperforming both pure theory-based agents and technique-only approaches. Further analysis reveals that theoretical quality strongly correlates with benchmark performance, with theory-based agents showing significant advantages in problem-centered design and objective-assessment alignment.

Although useful, task-specific modeling often increases training costs and limits generalization across behavioral settings. Recent reasoning RL methods facilitate training a single unified model across multiple behavioral tasks, but do not explicitly address learning across different heterogeneous behavioral data. To address this gap, we introduce Heterogeneity-Aware Relative Policy Optimization (HARPO), an RL method that balances leaning across heterogeneous tasks and samples. This is achieved by modulating advantages to ensure that no single task or sample carries disproportionate influence during policy optimization. Using HARPO, we develop and release Omnisapiens-7B 2.0, a foundation model for social behavior processing. Relative to existing behavioral foundation models, Omnisapiens-7B 2.0 achieves the strongest performance across behavioral tasks, with gains of up to +16.85% and +9.37% on multitask and held-out settings respectively, while producing more explicit and robust reasoning traces. We also validate HARPO against recent RL methods, where it achieves the most consistently strong performance across behavioral tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "HARPO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u4f18\u52bf\u51fd\u6570\u5e73\u8861\u5f02\u6784\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86Omnisapiens-7B 2.0\u793e\u4ea4\u884c\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5b64\u7acb\u5730\u5efa\u6a21\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u5982\u60c5\u611f\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u6216\u793e\u4f1a\u5c5e\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u6709\u7528\u4f46\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u5efa\u6a21\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u9650\u5236\u8de8\u884c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u63a8\u7406RL\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bad\u7ec3\u5355\u4e00\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u591a\u4e2a\u884c\u4e3a\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u660e\u786e\u89e3\u51b3\u8de8\u5f02\u6784\u884c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5f02\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08HARPO\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cdRL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u4f18\u52bf\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6ca1\u6709\u5355\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u6216\u6837\u672c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5e73\u8861\u8de8\u5f02\u6784\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528HARPO\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86Omnisapiens-7B 2.0\u793e\u4ea4\u884c\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u884c\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u4fdd\u7559\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u8fbe+16.85%\u548c+9.37%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u660e\u786e\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002HARPO\u5728\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6RL\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e2d\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "HARPO\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u8861\u8de8\u5f02\u6784\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u793e\u4ea4\u667a\u80fdAI\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u884c\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The learned bias vector alone accounts for 85% of improvement, and simpler adapters generalize better than more expressive alternatives.

While existing unsupervised methods attempt to analyze these variations via output features, they omit the underlying generative process. In this work, we propose a framework to disentangle these semantic directions directly within the input embedding space. To that end, we collect a set of gradients obtained by backpropagating the differences between stochastic realizations of a fixed prompt that we later decompose into meaningful steering directions with either Principal Components Analysis or Sparse Autoencoder. Our approach yields three key contributions: (1) it isolates interpretable, steerable directions for precise, fine-grained control over a single concept; (2) it effectively mitigates mode collapse in distilled models by reintroducing lost diversity; and (3) it establishes a novel estimator for concept complexity under a specific model, based on the dimensionality of the discovered subspace.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u5165\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u89e3\u8026\u8bed\u4e49\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u56fa\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u968f\u673a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u64cd\u63a7\u65b9\u5411", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u540c\u4e00\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u591a\u79cd\u968f\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u63a7\u5236\u5177\u4f53\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b", "method": "\u6536\u96c6\u56fa\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u968f\u673a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u5206\u6790\u6216\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u64cd\u63a7\u65b9\u5411", "result": "\u83b7\u5f97\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u64cd\u63a7\u65b9\u5411\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6982\u5ff5\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u84b8\u998f\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d1\u73b0\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668", "conclusion": "\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u89e3\u8026\u8bed\u4e49\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u6982\u5ff5\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a"}}

Under the classical model, a longstanding tension exists: Plurality, which suffers from the spoiler effect, achieves optimal $\u0398(m^2)$ distortion among deterministic rules, while normatively superior rules like Copeland and Borda have unbounded distortion. We resolve this tension under probabilistic voting with the Plackett-Luce model, where rankings are noisy reflections of utilities governed by an inverse temperature parameter $\u03b2$. Copeland and Borda both achieve at most $\u03b2\\frac{1+e^{-\u03b2}}{1-e^{-\u03b2}}$ distortion, independent of the number of candidates $m$, and within a factor of 2 of the lower bound for randomized rules satisfying the probabilistic Condorcet loser criterion known from prior work. This improves upon the prior $O(\u03b2^2)$ bound for Borda. These upper bounds are nearly tight: prior work establishes a $(1-o(1))\u03b2$ lower bound for Borda, and we prove a $(1-\u03b5)\u03b2$ lower bound for Copeland for any constant $\u03b5>0$. In contrast, rules that rely only on top-choice information fare worse: Plurality has distortion $\u03a9(\\min(e^\u03b2, m))$ and Random Dictator has distortion $\u0398(m)$. Additional `veto' information is also insufficient to remove the dependence on $m$; Plurality Veto and Pruned Plurality Veto have distortion $\u03a9(\u03b2\\ln m)$. We also prove a lower bound of $(\\frac{5}{8}-\u03b5)\u03b2$ (for any constant $\u03b5>0$) for all deterministic finite-precision tournament-based rules, a class that includes Copeland and any rule based on pairwise comparison margins rounded to fixed precision.

While explainability methods exist for other 3D representations, like point clouds, they typically rely on ambiguous saliency maps that fail to capture the volumetric coherence of Gaussian primitives. We introduce XSPLAIN, the first ante-hoc, prototype-based interpretability framework designed specifically for 3DGS classification. Our approach leverages a voxel-aggregated PointNet backbone and a novel, invertible orthogonal transformation that disentangles feature channels for interpretability while strictly preserving the original decision boundaries. Explanations are grounded in representative training examples, enabling intuitive ``this looks like that'' reasoning without any degradation in classification performance. A rigorous user study (N=51) demonstrates a decisive preference for our approach: participants selected XSPLAIN explanations 48.4\\% of the time as the best, significantly outperforming baselines $(p<0.001)$, showing that XSPLAIN provides transparency and user trust.

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) offer rich semantic priors that could supply such supervision, direct adoption in industrial recommendation is hindered by two obstacles: semantic signals can conflict with platform business objectives, and LLM inference is prohibitively expensive at scale. This paper presents S-GRec, a semantic-aware framework that decouples an online lightweight generator from an offline LLM-based semantic judge for train-time supervision. S-GRec introduces a two-stage Personalized Semantic Judge (PSJ) that produces interpretable aspect evidence and learns user-conditional aggregation from pairwise feedback, yielding stable semantic rewards. To prevent semantic supervision from deviating from business goals, Asymmetric Advantage Policy Optimization (A2PO) anchors optimization on business rewards (e.g., eCPM) and injects semantic advantages only when they are consistent. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks and a large-scale production system validate both effectiveness and scalability, including statistically significant gains in CTR and a 1.19\\% lift in GMV in online A/B tests, without requiring real-time LLM inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "S-GRec\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u7528\u79bb\u7ebfLLM\u8bed\u4e49\u5224\u65ad\u5668\u4e3a\u5728\u7ebf\u8f7b\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bad\u7ec3\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u5224\u65ad\u548c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u4f18\u52bf\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e1a\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6ce8\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u5b9e\u65f6LLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u8350\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u884c\u4e3a\u65e5\u5fd7\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u8f83\u5f31\uff0c\u800cLLM\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f46\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5de5\u4e1a\u63a8\u8350\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2a\u969c\u788d\uff1a\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u5e73\u53f0\u4e1a\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u4e14LLM\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faS-GRec\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5728\u7ebf\u8f7b\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4e0e\u79bb\u7ebfLLM\u8bed\u4e49\u5224\u65ad\u5668\u89e3\u8026\u3002\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u5224\u65ad\u5668\uff08PSJ\uff09\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65b9\u9762\u8bc1\u636e\u548c\u7528\u6237\u6761\u4ef6\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u4f18\u52bf\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08A2PO\uff09\u4ee5\u4e1a\u52a1\u5956\u52b1\uff08\u5982eCPM\uff09\u4e3a\u951a\u70b9\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u4f18\u52bf\u4e00\u81f4\u65f6\u6ce8\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5171\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u751f\u4ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ecCTR\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u5728\u7ebfA/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2dGMV\u589e\u957f1.19%\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u5b9e\u65f6LLM\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "S-GRec\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u76d1\u7763\u4e0e\u4e1a\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u63a8\u8350\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, fine-tuning these models with Reinforcement Learning (RL) often suffers from a fundamental probability-reward mismatch. Conventional likelihood-dominated decoding (e.g., beam search) exhibits a myopic bias toward locally probable prefixes, which causes two critical failures: (1) insufficient exploration, where high-reward items in low-probability branches are prematurely pruned and rarely sampled, and (2) advantage compression, where trajectories sharing high-probability prefixes receive highly correlated rewards with low within-group variance, yielding a weak comparative signal for RL. To address these challenges, we propose V-STAR, a Value-guided Sampling and Tree-structured Advantage Reinforcement framework. V-STAR forms a self-evolving loop via two synergistic components. First, a Value-Guided Efficient Decoding (VED) is developed to identify decisive nodes and selectively deepen high-potential prefixes. This improves exploration efficiency without exhaustive tree search. Second, we propose Sibling-GRPO, which exploits the induced tree topology to compute sibling-relative advantages and concentrates learning signals on decisive branching decisions.

Using 12.1 million samples across the Continental United States (2017--2023), we first present a comprehensive interpretability analysis of Google AlphaEarth's 64-dimensional embeddings against 26 environmental variables spanning climate, vegetation, hydrology, temperature, and terrain. Combining linear, nonlinear, and attention-based methods, we show that individual embedding dimensions map onto specific land surface properties, while the full embedding space reconstructs most environmental variables with high fidelity (12 of 26 variables exceed $R^2 > 0.90$; temperature and elevation approach $R^2 = 0.97$). The strongest dimension-variable relationships converge across all three analytical methods and remain robust under spatial block cross-validation (mean $\u0394R^2 = 0.017$) and temporally stable across all seven study years (mean inter-year correlation $r = 0.963$). Building on these validated interpretations, we then developed a Land Surface Intelligence system that implements retrieval-augmented generation over a FAISS-indexed embedding database of 12.1 million vectors, translating natural language environmental queries into satellite-grounded assessments. An LLM-as-Judge evaluation across 360 query--response cycles, using four LLMs in rotating generator, system, and judge roles, achieved weighted scores of $\u03bc= 3.74 \\pm 0.77$ (scale 1--5), with grounding ($\u03bc= 3.93$) and coherence ($\u03bc= 4.25$) as the strongest criteria.

While classifier guidance is a standard approach for approximating this ratio and can succeed in general, we show it can fail to faithfully unlearn with finite samples when the forget set represents a sharp, concentrated data distribution. To address this, we introduce Temper-Then-Tilt Unlearning (T3-Unlearning), which freezes the base model and applies a two-step inference procedure: (i) tempering the base distribution to flatten high-confidence spikes, and (ii) tilting the tempered distribution using a lightweight classifier trained to distinguish retain from forget samples. Our theoretical analysis provides finite-sample guarantees linking the surrogate classifier's risk to unlearning error, proving that tempering is necessary to successfully unlearn for concentrated distributions. Empirical evaluations on the TOFU benchmark show that T3-Unlearning improves forget quality and generative utility over existing baselines, while training only a fraction of the parameters with a minimal runtime.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faT3-Unlearning\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6e29\u5ea6\u8c03\u8282\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u503e\u659c\u4e24\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u5728\u96c6\u4e2d\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u5931\u6548\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u96c6\u4e2d\u3001\u5c16\u9510\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u65f6\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u5fe0\u5b9e\u9057\u5fd8\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5904\u7406\u5927\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "T3-Unlearning\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u6b65\u9aa4\u63a8\u7406\uff1a1) \u6e29\u5ea6\u8c03\u8282\uff1a\u51bb\u7ed3\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6e29\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u5e73\u6ed1\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5cf0\u503c\uff1b2) \u503e\u659c\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff08\u533a\u5206\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u9057\u5fd8\u6837\u672c\uff09\u5bf9\u8c03\u8282\u540e\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u8fdb\u884c\u503e\u659c\u3002", "result": "\u5728TOFU\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cT3-Unlearning\u5728\u9057\u5fd8\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ec5\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c11\u91cf\u53c2\u6570\u4e14\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u6700\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "T3-Unlearning\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6e29\u5ea6\u8c03\u8282\u5bf9\u4e8e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6210\u529f\u9057\u5fd8\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing black-box extraction attacks primarily rely on hard labels or pairwise learning, often ignoring the importance of ranking positions, which results in incomplete knowledge transfer. Moreover, adversarial sequences generated via pure gradient methods lack semantic consistency with real user behavior, making them easily detectable. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a dual-enhanced attack framework. First, drawing on primacy effects and position bias, we introduce a cognitive distribution-driven extraction mechanism that maps discrete rankings into continuous value distributions with position-aware decay, thereby advancing from order alignment to cognitive distribution alignment. Second, we design a behavior-aware noisy item generation strategy that jointly optimizes collaborative signals and gradient signals. This ensures both semantic coherence and statistical stealth while effectively promoting target item rankings. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in both attack success rate and evasion rate, validating the value of integrating cognitive modeling and behavioral consistency for secure recommender systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u589e\u5f3a\u653b\u51fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba4\u77e5\u5206\u5e03\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u63d0\u53d6\u673a\u5236\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u9879\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u89c4\u907f\u7387", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9ed1\u76d2\u63d0\u53d6\u653b\u51fb\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u786c\u6807\u7b7e\u6216\u6210\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6392\u540d\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u7eaf\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u5e8f\u5217\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u68c0\u6d4b", "method": "1. \u5f15\u5165\u8ba4\u77e5\u5206\u5e03\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u63d0\u53d6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9996\u56e0\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5c06\u79bb\u6563\u6392\u540d\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u4f4d\u7f6e\u611f\u77e5\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u503c\u5206\u5e03\uff1b2. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u884c\u4e3a\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u9879\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u534f\u540c\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u89c4\u907f\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6574\u5408\u8ba4\u77e5\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4e3a\u9632\u5fa1\u6b64\u7c7b\u653b\u51fb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u53c2\u8003"}}

Beyond traditional source-code components, LLMware embeds or interacts with LLMs that depend on other models and datasets, forming complex supply chains across open-source software (OSS), models, and datasets. However, licensing issues emerging from these intertwined dependencies remain largely unexplored. Leveraging GitHub and Hugging Face, we curate a large-scale dataset capturing LLMware supply chains, including 12,180 OSS repositories, 3,988 LLMs, and 708 datasets. Our analysis reveals that license distributions in LLMware differ substantially from traditional OSS ecosystems. We further examine license-related discussions and find that license selection and maintenance are the dominant concerns, accounting for 84% of cases. To understand incompatibility risks, we analyze license conflicts along supply chains and evaluate state-of-the-art detection approaches, which achieve only 58% and 76% F1 scores in this setting. Motivated by these limitations, we propose LiAgent, an LLM-based agent framework for ecosystem-level license compatibility analysis. LiAgent achieves an F1 score of 87%, improving performance by 14 percentage points over prior methods.

GenAI is expected to enhance cognitive systems by enabling personalized learning and streamlining educational services. However, stakeholders perceptions of GenAI in higher education remain divided, shaped by cultural, disciplinary, and institutional contexts. In addition, the EU AI Act requires universities to ensure regulatory compliance when deploying cognitive systems. These developments highlight the need for institutions to engage stakeholders and tailor GenAI integration to their needs while addressing concerns. This study investigates how GenAI is perceived within the disciplines of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (ITEE). Using a mixed-method approach, we surveyed 61 staff and 37 students at the Faculty of ITEE, University of Oulu. The results reveal both shared and discipline-specific themes, including strong interest in programming support from GenAI and concerns over response quality, privacy, and academic integrity. Drawing from these insights, the study identifies a set of high-level requirements and proposes a conceptual framework for responsible GenAI integration. Disciplinary-specific requirements reinforce the importance of stakeholder engagement when integrating GenAI into higher education. The high-level requirements and the framework provide practical guidance for universities aiming to harness GenAI while addressing stakeholder concerns and ensuring regulatory compliance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8c03\u67e5\u4e86\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u4e2dITEE\u9886\u57df\u5e08\u751f\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5171\u540c\u548c\u5b66\u79d1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u6574\u5408\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u9ad8\u5c42\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u5e08\u751f\u5df2\u5e7f\u6cdb\u91c7\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5176\u8ba4\u77e5\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u6b67\uff0c\u4e14\u6b27\u76dfAI\u6cd5\u6848\u8981\u6c42\u5927\u5b66\u786e\u4fdd\u8ba4\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5408\u89c4\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u673a\u6784\u6839\u636e\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u9700\u6c42\u5b9a\u5236AI\u6574\u5408\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u5965\u5362\u5927\u5b66ITEE\u5b66\u9662\u768461\u540d\u6559\u804c\u5458\u5de5\u548c37\u540d\u5b66\u751f\u8fdb\u884c\u95ee\u5377\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4ed6\u4eec\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5171\u540c\u548c\u5b66\u79d1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\uff1a\u5bf9\u7f16\u7a0b\u652f\u6301\u7684\u5f3a\u70c8\u5174\u8da3\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u5b66\u672f\u8bda\u4fe1\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9ad8\u5c42\u8981\u6c42\u548c\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u6574\u5408\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b66\u79d1\u7279\u5b9a\u8981\u6c42\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u9ad8\u5c42\u8981\u6c42\u548c\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5927\u5b66\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u5173\u5207\u548c\u786e\u4fdd\u5408\u89c4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

These characteristics cause agents to frequently encounter unseen scenarios and distribution shifts, making continual learning in specific environments essential for computer-use agents (CUAs). However, a key challenge lies in obtaining high-quality and environment-grounded agent data without relying on costly human annotation. In this work, we introduce ACuRL, an Autonomous Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework that continually adapts agents to specific environments with zero human data. The agent first explores target environments to acquire initial experiences. During subsequent iterative training, a curriculum task generator leverages these experiences together with feedback from the previous iteration to synthesize new tasks tailored for the agent's current capabilities. To provide reliable reward signals, we introduce CUAJudge, a robust automatic evaluator for CUAs that achieves 93% agreement with human judgments. Empirically, our method effectively enables both intra-environment and cross-environment continual learning, yielding 4-22% performance gains without catastrophic forgetting on existing environments. Further analyses show highly sparse updates (e.g., 20% parameters), which helps explain the effective and robust adaptation.

Despite its efficacy, RLVR faces a meta-learning bottleneck: it lacks mechanisms for error attribution and experience internalization intrinsic to the human learning cycle beyond practice and verification, thereby limiting fine-grained credit assignment and reusable knowledge formation. We term such reusable knowledge representations derived from past errors as meta-experience. Based on this insight, we propose Meta-Experience Learning (MEL), a novel framework that incorporates self-distilled meta-experience into the model's parametric memory. Building upon standard RLVR, we introduce an additional design that leverages the LLM's self-verification capability to conduct contrastive analysis on paired correct and incorrect trajectories, identify the precise bifurcation points where reasoning errors arise, and summarize them into generalizable meta-experience. The meta-experience is further internalized into the LLM's parametric memory by minimizing the negative log-likelihood, which induces a language-modeled reward signal that bridges correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories and facilitates effective knowledge reuse. Experimental results demonstrate that MEL achieves consistent improvements on benchmarks, yielding 3.92%--4.73% Pass@1 gains across varying model sizes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMeta-Experience Learning (MEL)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6211\u84b8\u998f\u5143\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709RLVR\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9519\u8bef\u5f52\u56e0\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5185\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RLVR\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u74f6\u9888\uff1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9519\u8bef\u5f52\u56e0\u673a\u5236\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5185\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u9519\u8bef\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6RLVR\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLM\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\u5bf9\u6b63\u786e\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u63a8\u7406\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u5206\u53c9\u70b9\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u603b\u7ed3\u4e3a\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5143\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8d1f\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\u5c06\u5143\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5185\u5316\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eMEL\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f973.92%--4.73%\u7684Pass@1\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "MEL\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5143\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5185\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86RLVR\u7684\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Fairness auditing of these models is limited by the lack of reliable skin-tone annotations in public dermatoscopy datasets. We address this gap with neural networks that predict Fitzpatrick skin type via ordinal regression and the Individual Typology Angle (ITA) via color regression, using in-person Fitzpatrick labels and colorimeter measurements as targets. We further leverage extensive pretraining on synthetic and real dermatoscopic and clinical images. The Fitzpatrick model achieves agreement comparable to human crowdsourced annotations, and ITA predictions show high concordance with colorimeter-derived ITA, substantially outperforming pixel-averaging approaches. Applying these estimators to ISIC 2020 and MILK10k, we find that fewer than 1% of subjects belong to Fitzpatrick types V and VI. We release code and pretrained models as an open-source tool for rapid skin-tone annotation and bias auditing.

Existing approaches typically employ early aggregation of user behaviors to maintain efficiency. However, such non-unified or partially unified modeling creates an information bottleneck by discarding fine-grained, token-level signals essential for unlocking scaling gains. In this work, we revisit the fundamental distinctions between CTR prediction and Large Language Models (LLMs), identifying two critical properties: the asymmetry in information density between behavioral and non-behavioral features, and the modality-specific priors of content-rich signals. Accordingly, we propose the Efficiently Scalable Transformer (EST), which achieves fully unified modeling by processing all raw inputs in a single sequence without lossy aggregation. EST integrates two modules: Lightweight Cross-Attention (LCA), which prunes redundant self-interactions to focus on high-impact cross-feature dependencies, and Content Sparse Attention (CSA), which utilizes content similarity to dynamically select high-signal behaviors. Extensive experiments show that EST exhibits a stable and efficient power-law scaling relationship, enabling predictable performance gains with model scale. Deployed on Taobao's display advertising platform, EST significantly outperforms production baselines, delivering a 3.27\\% RPM (Revenue Per Mile) increase and a 1.22\\% CTR lift, establishing a practical pathway for scalable industrial CTR prediction models.", "AI": {"tldr": "EST\uff08\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u6269\u5c55Transformer\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u5904\u7406\u539f\u59cb\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5de5\u4e1aCTR\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u5e42\u5f8b\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5728\u6dd8\u5b9d\u5e7f\u544a\u5e73\u53f0\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709CTR\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u65e9\u671f\u884c\u4e3a\u805a\u5408\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u975e\u7edf\u4e00\u6216\u90e8\u5206\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u4f1a\u4e22\u5f03\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6token\u7ea7\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6269\u5c55\u589e\u76ca\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6CTR\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0eLLM\u7684\u6839\u672c\u533a\u522b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u975e\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5185\u5bb9\u4e30\u5bcc\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u6269\u5c55Transformer\uff08EST\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e00\u5e8f\u5217\u5904\u7406\u6240\u6709\u539f\u59cb\u8f93\u5165\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff1a1\uff09\u8f7b\u91cf\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08LCA\uff09\uff0c\u4fee\u526a\u5197\u4f59\u81ea\u4ea4\u4e92\u4ee5\u805a\u7126\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u8de8\u7279\u5f81\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b2\uff09\u5185\u5bb9\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08CSA\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5185\u5bb9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u9ad8\u4fe1\u53f7\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eEST\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u7a33\u5b9a\u9ad8\u6548\u5e42\u5f8b\u6269\u5c55\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u589e\u76ca\u3002\u5728\u6dd8\u5b9d\u5c55\u793a\u5e7f\u544a\u5e73\u53f0\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\uff0cEST\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u751f\u4ea7\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e26\u67653.27%\u7684RPM\uff08\u6bcf\u5343\u6b21\u5c55\u793a\u6536\u5165\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u548c1.22%\u7684CTR\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "EST\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1aCTR\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u4e13\u95e8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

We introduce ScratchWorld, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal GUI agents on program-by-construction tasks in Scratch. Grounded in the Use-Modify-Create pedagogical framework, ScratchWorld comprises 83 curated tasks spanning four distinct problem categories: Create, Debug, Extend, and Compute. To rigorously diagnose the source of agent failures, the benchmark employs two complementary interaction modes: primitive mode requires fine-grained drag-and-drop manipulation to directly assess visuomotor control, while composite mode uses high-level semantic APIs to disentangle program reasoning from GUI execution. To ensure reliable assessment, we propose an execution-based evaluation protocol that validates the functional correctness of the constructed Scratch programs through runtime tests within the browser environment.

We argue that these inconsistencies stem from two overlooked bottlenecks: evidence alignment and sub-claim error profiles. To better understand these factors, we introduce a new dataset of real-world complex claims, featuring temporally bounded evidence and human-annotated sub-claim evidence spans. We evaluate decomposition under two evidence alignment setups: Sub-claim Aligned Evidence (SAE) and Repeated Claim-level Evidence (SRE). Our results reveal that decomposition brings significant performance improvement only when evidence is granular and strictly aligned. By contrast, standard setups that rely on repeated claim-level evidence (SRE) fail to improve and often degrade performance as shown across different datasets and domains (PHEMEPlus, MMM-Fact, COVID-Fact). Furthermore, we demonstrate that in the presence of noisy sub-claim labels, the nature of the error ends up determining downstream robustness. We find that conservative \"abstention\" significantly reduces error propagation compared to aggressive but incorrect predictions. These findings suggest that future claim decomposition frameworks must prioritize precise evidence synthesis and calibrate the label bias of sub-claim verification models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5206\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u58f0\u660e\u4ec5\u5728\u8bc1\u636e\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u65f6\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u91cd\u590d\u8bc1\u636e\u65b9\u6cd5\u53cd\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b50\u58f0\u660e\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u4e2d\u4fdd\u5b88\u5f03\u6743\u4f18\u4e8e\u9519\u8bef\u9884\u6d4b", "motivation": "\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u58f0\u660e\u5206\u89e3\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u590d\u6742\u591a\u9762\u58f0\u660e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6e90\u4e8e\u4e24\u4e2a\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u74f6\u9888\uff1a\u8bc1\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5b50\u58f0\u660e\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5305\u542b\u65f6\u95f4\u9650\u5236\u8bc1\u636e\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u5b50\u58f0\u660e\u8bc1\u636e\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u590d\u6742\u58f0\u660e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e24\u79cd\u8bc1\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff1a\u5b50\u58f0\u660e\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bc1\u636e(SAE)\u548c\u91cd\u590d\u58f0\u660e\u7ea7\u8bc1\u636e(SRE)", "result": "\u5206\u89e3\u4ec5\u5728\u8bc1\u636e\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e25\u683c\u5bf9\u9f50\u65f6\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u800c\u4f9d\u8d56\u91cd\u590d\u58f0\u660e\u7ea7\u8bc1\u636e(SRE)\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u65e0\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u4e14\u5e38\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u5728PHEMEPlus\u3001MMM-Fact\u3001COVID-Fact\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff09\u3002\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u5b50\u58f0\u660e\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0b\uff0c\u4fdd\u5b88\"\u5f03\u6743\"\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad", "conclusion": "\u672a\u6765\u58f0\u660e\u5206\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\u5fc5\u987b\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u7cbe\u786e\u8bc1\u636e\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u6821\u51c6\u5b50\u58f0\u660e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u8bc1\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u662f\u5206\u89e3\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20"}}

Achieving substantial improvements in these areas is a non-trivial task, traditionally relying on extensive manual iterations to test new hypotheses. We propose a self-evolving system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically those from Google's Gemini family, to autonomously generate, train, and deploy high-performing, complex model changes within an end-to-end automated workflow. The self-evolving system is comprised of an Offline Agent (Inner Loop) that performs high-throughput hypothesis generation using proxy metrics, and an Online Agent (Outer Loop) that validates candidates against delayed north star business metrics in live production. Our agents act as specialized Machine Learning Engineers (MLEs): they exhibit deep reasoning capabilities, discovering novel improvements in optimization algorithms and model architecture, and formulating innovative reward functions that target long-term user engagement. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through several successful production launches at YouTube, confirming that autonomous, LLM-driven evolution can surpass traditional engineering workflows in both development velocity and model performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u90e8\u7f72YouTube\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u4eba\u5de5\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982\u89c6\u9891\u5e73\u53f0\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u9762\u4e34\u5de8\u5927\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u590d\u6742\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u8fed\u4ee3\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8eGoogle Gemini LLM\u7684\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u79bb\u7ebf\u4ee3\u7406\uff08\u5185\u5faa\u73af\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u5047\u8bbe\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u4ee3\u7406\uff08\u5916\u5faa\u73af\uff09\u5728\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5019\u9009\u65b9\u6848", "result": "\u5728YouTube\u6210\u529f\u90e8\u7f72\u591a\u4e2a\u751f\u4ea7\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u8fdb\u5316\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u5de5\u7a0b\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u4e3bLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd"}}

While state-of-the-art generative models can synthesize auxiliary views to provide additional supervision, these views inevitably contain geometric inconsistencies and textural misalignments that propagate and amplify artifacts during 3D reconstruction. To effectively harness these imperfect supervisory signals, we propose an adaptive optimization framework guided by excess risk decomposition, termed ERGO. Specifically, ERGO decomposes the optimization losses in 3D Gaussian splatting into two components, i.e., excess risk that quantifies the suboptimality gap between current and optimal parameters, and Bayes error that models the irreducible noise inherent in synthesized views. This decomposition enables ERGO to dynamically estimate the view-specific excess risk and adaptively adjust loss weights during optimization. Furthermore, we introduce geometry-aware and texture-aware objectives that complement the excess-risk-derived weighting mechanism, establishing a synergistic global-local optimization paradigm. Consequently, ERGO demonstrates robustness against supervision noise while consistently enhancing both geometric fidelity and textural quality of the reconstructed 3D content. Extensive experiments on the Google Scanned Objects dataset and the OmniObject3D dataset demonstrate the superiority of ERGO over existing state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "ERGO\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u989d\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u62103D\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u635f\u5931\u6743\u91cd\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u5408\u6210\u89c6\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u9519\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u62103D\u5185\u5bb9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u75c5\u6001\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u906e\u6321\u533a\u57df\u7f3a\u4e4f\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u8f85\u52a9\u89c6\u56fe\u63d0\u4f9b\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c6\u56fe\u5b58\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u9519\u4f4d\uff0c\u4f1a\u57283D\u91cd\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u653e\u5927\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faERGO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c063D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u635f\u5931\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u5206\u91cf\uff1a\u8d85\u989d\u98ce\u9669\uff08\u91cf\u5316\u5f53\u524d\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u53c2\u6570\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff09\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8bef\u5dee\uff08\u5efa\u6a21\u5408\u6210\u89c6\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u566a\u58f0\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u79cd\u5206\u89e3\uff0cERGO\u80fd\u591f\u52a8\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u89c6\u56fe\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8d85\u989d\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u635f\u5931\u6743\u91cd\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4e0e\u8d85\u989d\u98ce\u9669\u6743\u91cd\u673a\u5236\u534f\u540c\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u5168\u5c40-\u5c40\u90e8\u4f18\u5316\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728Google Scanned Objects\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cOmniObject3D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cERGO\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u76d1\u7763\u566a\u58f0\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91cd\u5efa3D\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ERGO\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u989d\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u635f\u5931\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u62103D\u5185\u5bb9\u65f6\u5408\u6210\u89c6\u56fe\u566a\u58f0\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\u3002"}}

However, recent reports claim a broad preference for text generated by large language models (LLMs). This bias is called \"source bias\", and it has been hypothesized that lower perplexity contributes to this effect. In this study, we revisit this claim by conducting a controlled evaluation to trace the emergence of such preferences across training stages and data sources. Using parallel human- and LLM-generated counterparts of the SciFact and Natural Questions (NQ320K) datasets, we compare unsupervised checkpoints with models fine-tuned using in-domain human text, in-domain LLM-generated text, and MS MARCO. Our results show the following: 1) Unsupervised retrievers do not exhibit a uniform pro-LLM preference. The direction and magnitude depend on the dataset. 2) Across the settings tested, supervised fine-tuning on MS MARCO consistently shifts the rankings toward LLM-generated text. 3) In-domain fine-tuning produces dataset-specific and inconsistent shifts in preference. 4) Fine-tuning on LLM-generated corpora induces a pronounced pro-LLM bias. Finally, a retriever-centric perplexity probe involving the reattachment of a language modeling head to the fine-tuned dense retriever encoder indicates agreement with relevance near chance, thereby weakening the explanatory power of perplexity. Our study demonstrates that source bias is a training-induced phenomenon rather than an inherent property of dense retrievers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5bc6\u96c6\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u7684\"\u6e90\u504f\u89c1\"\uff08\u504f\u597dLLM\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\uff09\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bf1\u5bfc\u73b0\u8c61\u800c\u975e\u56fa\u6709\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u504f\u89c1\u65b9\u5411", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u671f\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u51fa\u5bc6\u96c6\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u666e\u904d\u504f\u597dLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6587\u672c\uff08\u6e90\u504f\u89c1\uff09\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u8f83\u4f4e\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b64\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u91cd\u65b0\u68c0\u9a8c\u8fd9\u4e00\u4e3b\u5f20\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u6765\u6e90\u548c\u673a\u5236", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528SciFact\u548cNQ320K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cLLM\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u4e0e\u4f7f\u7528\u9886\u57df\u5185\u4eba\u7c7b\u6587\u672c\u3001\u9886\u57df\u5185LLM\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u548cMS MARCO\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u63a2\u9488\u5206\u6790", "result": "1) \u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u6ca1\u6709\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u4eb2LLM\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u5e45\u5ea6\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b2) MS MARCO\u5fae\u8c03\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f7f\u6392\u540d\u504f\u5411LLM\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\uff1b3) \u9886\u57df\u5185\u5fae\u8c03\u4ea7\u751f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5b9a\u4e14\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u504f\u597d\u53d8\u5316\uff1b4) LLM\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u6599\u5fae\u8c03\u8bf1\u5bfc\u663e\u8457\u7684\u4eb2LLM\u504f\u89c1\uff1b\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u63a5\u8fd1\u968f\u673a\u6c34\u5e73", "conclusion": "\u6e90\u504f\u89c1\u662f\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bf1\u5bfc\u73b0\u8c61\u800c\u975e\u5bc6\u96c6\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u504f\u89c1\u5f62\u6210\u8d77\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u89e3\u91ca\u529b\u6709\u9650"}}

Such results often meet or exceed the baseline performance. However, these comparisons have two primary issues. First, they mostly considered only reliability as a comparison metric and selected a few LLMs (such as Codex and ChatGPT) for comparision. This paper proposes a comprehensive code quality assessment framework called Programmatic Excellence via LLM Iteration (PELLI). PELLI is an iterative analysis-based process that upholds high-quality code changes. We extended the state-of-the-art by performing a comprehensive evaluation that generates quantitative metrics for analyzing three primary nonfunctional requirements (such as maintainability, performance, and reliability) while selecting five popular LLMs. For PELLI's applicability, we selected three application domains while following Python coding standards. Following this framework, practitioners can ensure harmonious integration between LLMs and human developers, ensuring that their potential is fully realized. PELLI can serve as a practical guide for developers aiming to leverage LLMs while adhering to recognized quality standards. This study's outcomes are crucial for advancing LLM technologies in real-world applications, providing stakeholders with a clear understanding of where these LLMs excel and where they require further refinement. Overall, based on three nonfunctional requirements, we have found that GPT-4T and Gemini performed slightly better. We also found that prompt design can influence the overall code quality. In addition, each application domain demonstrated high and low scores across various metrics, and even within the same metrics across different prompts.", "AI": {"tldr": "PELLI\u6846\u67b6\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\uff0cGPT-4T\u548cGemini\u8868\u73b0\u7565\u4f18\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f71\u54cd\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u660e\u663e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6307\u6807\u4e14\u53ea\u6bd4\u8f83\u5c11\u6570LLM\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u975e\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u9700\u6c42\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPELLI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u5206\u6790\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u9009\u62e95\u4e2a\u6d41\u884cLLM\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e3\u4e2a\u975e\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u9700\u6c42\uff08\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u6027\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff09\u751f\u6210\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u57283\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u9075\u5faaPython\u7f16\u7801\u6807\u51c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "GPT-4T\u548cGemini\u8868\u73b0\u7565\u597d\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u5728\u5404\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u540c\u4e00\u6307\u6807\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u4e5f\u6709\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "PELLI\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5357\u5e2e\u52a9\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5229\u7528LLM\u540c\u65f6\u9075\u5b88\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdbLLM\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4e3a\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u6e05\u6670\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

However, existing paradigms encounter a critical \"structural resolution mismatch,\" failing to reconcile divergent representational demands across varying graph densities, which precipitates structural noise interference in dense clusters and catastrophic representation collapse in sparse regions. We present SynergyKGC, an adaptive framework that advances traditional neighbor aggregation to an active Cross-Modal Synergy Expert via relation-aware cross-attention and semantic-intent-driven gating. By coupling a density-dependent Identity Anchoring strategy with a Double-tower Coherent Consistency architecture, SynergyKGC effectively reconciles topological heterogeneity while ensuring representational stability across training and inference phases.

We present the first mechanistic analysis of language-switching backdoors, studying the GAPperon model family (1B, 8B, 24B parameters) which contains triggers injected during pretraining that cause output language switching. Using activation patching, we localize trigger formation to early layers (7.5-25% of model depth) and identify which attention heads process trigger information. Our central finding is that trigger-activated heads substantially overlap with heads naturally encoding output language across model scales, with Jaccard indices between 0.18 and 0.66 over the top heads identified. This suggests that backdoor triggers do not form isolated circuits but instead co-opt the model's existing language components. These findings have implications for backdoor defense: detection methods may benefit from monitoring known functional components rather than searching for hidden circuits, and mitigation strategies could potentially leverage this entanglement between injected and natural behaviors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u5207\u6362\u540e\u95e8\u8fdb\u884c\u673a\u5236\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u540e\u95e8\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u5e76\u975e\u5f62\u6210\u72ec\u7acb\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u52ab\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u6709\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u7f16\u7801\u7ec4\u4ef6", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u5b58\u5728\u91cd\u5927\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4f46\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u5185\u90e8\u5de5\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u673a\u5236\u539f\u7406", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4fee\u8865\u6280\u672f\u5206\u6790GAPperon\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\uff081B\u30018B\u300124B\u53c2\u6570\uff09\uff0c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u5f62\u6210\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\uff087.5-25%\u6df1\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5904\u7406\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u7f16\u7801\u8f93\u51fa\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u9ad8\u5ea6\u91cd\u53e0\uff08Jaccard\u6307\u65700.18-0.66\uff09\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u540e\u95e8\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u52ab\u6301\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u7ec4\u4ef6\u800c\u975e\u5f62\u6210\u72ec\u7acb\u7535\u8def", "conclusion": "\u540e\u95e8\u68c0\u6d4b\u53ef\u76d1\u63a7\u5df2\u77e5\u529f\u80fd\u7ec4\u4ef6\u800c\u975e\u641c\u7d22\u9690\u85cf\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u5229\u7528\u6ce8\u5165\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u884c\u4e3a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u5173\u7cfb"}}

However, achieving this protection typically requires adding noise, and noise can accumulate when many statistics are measured. Existing DP synthetic data methods treat all features symmetrically, spreading noise uniformly even when the data will serve a specific prediction task.\n  We develop a prediction-centric approach operating in three regimes depending on available structural knowledge. In the causal regime, when the causal parents of $Y$ are known and distribution shift is expected, we target the parents for robustness. In the graphical regime, when a Bayesian network structure is available and the distribution is stable, the Markov blanket of $Y$ provides a sufficient feature set for optimal prediction. In the predictive regime, when no structural knowledge exists, we select features via differentially private methods without claiming to recover causal or graphical structure.\n  We formalize this as PRISM, a mechanism that (i) identifies a predictive feature subset according to the appropriate regime, (ii) constructs targeted summary statistics, (iii) allocates budget to minimize an upper bound on prediction error, and (iv) synthesizes data via graphical-model inference.

To prevent the abuse of these attack algorithms from affecting the practical application of diffusion models, it is critical to develop corresponding defensive strategies. In this work, we propose an efficient defensive strategy, named Low-Rank Defense (LoRD), to defend the adversarial attack on Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs). LoRD introduces the merging idea and a balance parameter, combined with the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) modules, to detect and defend the adversarial samples. Based on LoRD, we build up a defense pipeline that applies the learned LoRD modules to help diffusion models defend against attack algorithms. Our method ensures that the LDM fine-tuned on both adversarial and clean samples can still generate high-quality images. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on facial and landscape images, and our method shows significantly better defense performance compared to the baseline methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLoRD\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u914d\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5e73\u8861\u53c2\u6570\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u653b\u51fb\u7b97\u6cd5\u88ab\u6ee5\u7528\uff0c\u4fdd\u62a4\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLoRD\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5408\u5e76\u601d\u60f3\u548c\u5e73\u8861\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u914d\u6a21\u5757\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u9632\u5fa1\u6d41\u7a0b", "result": "\u5728\u9762\u90e8\u548c\u98ce\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "LoRD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5e72\u51c0\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf"}}

Unlike many clustering methods, HAC does not optimize a single explicit global objective; clustering quality is therefore primarily evaluated empirically, and the choice of linkage function plays a crucial role in practice. However, popular classical linkages, such as single-linkage, average-linkage and Ward's method show high variability across real-world datasets and do not consistently produce high-quality clusterings in practice.\n  In this paper, we propose \\emph{Chamfer-linkage}, a novel linkage function that measures the distance between clusters using the Chamfer distance, a popular notion of distance between point-clouds in machine learning and computer vision. We argue that Chamfer-linkage satisfies desirable concept representation properties that other popular measures struggle to satisfy. Theoretically, we show that Chamfer-linkage HAC can be implemented in $O(n^2)$ time, matching the efficiency of classical linkage functions. Experimentally, we find that Chamfer-linkage consistently yields higher-quality clusterings than classical linkages such as average-linkage and Ward's method across a diverse collection of datasets. Our results establish Chamfer-linkage as a practical drop-in replacement for classical linkage functions, broadening the toolkit for hierarchical clustering in both theory and practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faChamfer-linkage\u4f5c\u4e3aHAC\u7684\u65b0\u8fde\u63a5\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Chamfer\u8ddd\u79bb\u8861\u91cf\u7c07\u95f4\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u8fde\u63a5\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301O(n\u00b2)\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfHAC\u8fde\u63a5\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u5982\u5355\u8fde\u63a5\u3001\u5e73\u5747\u8fde\u63a5\u3001Ward\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u8d28\u91cf\u53c2\u5dee\u4e0d\u9f50\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faChamfer-linkage\u8fde\u63a5\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5e38\u7528\u7684Chamfer\u8ddd\u79bb\u8ba1\u7b97\u7c07\u95f4\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u8be5\u8ddd\u79bb\u6ee1\u8db3\u6982\u5ff5\u8868\u793a\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0O(n\u00b2)\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660eChamfer-linkage HAC\u53ef\u5728O(n\u00b2)\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cChamfer-linkage\u6bd4\u5e73\u5747\u8fde\u63a5\u548cWard\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b49\u4f20\u7edf\u8fde\u63a5\u51fd\u6570\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "Chamfer-linkage\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f20\u7edf\u8fde\u63a5\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5c42\u6b21\u805a\u7c7b\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

To address this challenge, we conducted a five year longitudinal case study with Grundfos AB, in collaboration with the Software Centre in Sweden. RE principles were first derived through qualitative data collection spanning more than 25 sprints, approximately 320 weekly synchronisation meetings, and seven cross-company, company-specific workshops between 2019 and 2024. These activities engaged practitioners from diverse roles, representing several hundred developers across domains. In late 2024, five in depth focus groups with senior leaders at Grundfos provided retrospective validation of the principles and assessed their strategic impact. We aim to (1) empirically examine RE principles in large scale agile system development, (2) explore their benefits in practice within the case company, and (3) identify a set of transferable RE principles for large scale contexts. Using thematic analysis, six key RE principles architectural context, stakeholder-driven validation and alignment, requirements practices in large-scale agile organisations. evolution with lightweight documentation, delegated requirements management, organisational roles and responsibilities, and a shared understanding of requirements are derived.

We introduce Multimodal Finance Eval, the first multimodal benchmark for evaluating French financial document understanding. The dataset contains 1,204 expert-validated questions spanning text extraction, table comprehension, chart interpretation, and multi-turn conversational reasoning, drawn from real investment prospectuses, KIDs, and PRIIPs. We evaluate six open-weight VLMs (8B-124B parameters) using an LLM-as-judge protocol. While models achieve strong performance on text and table tasks (85-90% accuracy), they struggle with chart interpretation (34-62%). Most notably, multi-turn dialogue reveals a sharp failure mode: early mistakes propagate across turns, driving accuracy down to roughly 50% regardless of model size.\n  These results show that current VLMs are effective for well-defined extraction tasks but remain brittle in interactive, multi-step financial analysis.

See https://github.com/inkitori/taudio/", "summary": "Large audio language models are increasingly used for complex audio understanding tasks, but they struggle with temporal tasks that require precise temporal grounding, such as word alignment and speaker diarization. The standard approach, where we generate timestamps as sequences of text tokens, is computationally expensive and prone to hallucination, especially when processing audio lengths outside the model's training distribution. In this work, we propose frame-level internal tool use, a method that trains audio LMs to use their own internal audio representations to perform temporal grounding directly. We introduce a lightweight prediction mechanism trained via two objectives: a binary frame classifier and a novel inhomogeneous Poisson process (IHP) loss that models temporal event intensity. Across word localization, speaker diarization, and event localization tasks, our approach outperforms token-based baselines. Most notably, it achieves a >50x inference speedup and demonstrates robust length generalization, maintaining high accuracy on out-of-distribution audio durations where standard token-based models collapse completely.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5e27\u7ea7\u5185\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8ba9\u97f3\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u76f4\u63a5\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u8eab\u5185\u90e8\u97f3\u9891\u8868\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6587\u672c\u6807\u8bb0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b050\u500d\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u97f3\u9891\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u97f3\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u8bcd\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u5206\u79bb\uff09\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u751f\u6210\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u6807\u8bb0\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8d85\u51fa\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u97f3\u9891\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e27\u7ea7\u5185\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u97f3\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u8eab\u5185\u90e8\u97f3\u9891\u8868\u793a\u76f4\u63a5\u8fdb\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9884\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1a\u4e8c\u5143\u5e27\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548c\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u975e\u9f50\u6b21\u6cca\u677e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u95f4\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8bcd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6700\u663e\u8457\u7684\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc750\u500d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u97f3\u9891\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5b8c\u5168\u5931\u6548\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e27\u7ea7\u5185\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u97f3\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u97f3\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

As their presence grows, it becomes important to assess the current boundaries of their coding abilities. Existing agentic coding benchmarks, however, cover a limited task scope, e.g., bug fixing within a single pull request (PR), and often rely on non-executable evaluations or lack an automated approach for continually updating the evaluation coverage. To address such issues, we propose FeatureBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate agentic coding performance in end-to-end, feature-oriented software development. FeatureBench incorporates an execution-based evaluation protocol and a scalable test-driven method that automatically derives tasks from code repositories with minimal human effort. By tracing from unit tests along a dependency graph, our approach can identify feature-level coding tasks spanning multiple commits and PRs scattered across the development timeline, while ensuring the proper functioning of other features after the separation. Using this framework, we curated 200 challenging evaluation tasks and 3825 executable environments from 24 open-source repositories in the first version of our benchmark. Empirical evaluation reveals that the state-of-the-art agentic model, such as Claude 4.5 Opus, which achieves a 74.4% resolved rate on SWE-bench, succeeds on only 11.0% of tasks, opening new opportunities for advancing agentic coding. Moreover, benefiting from our automated task collection toolkit, FeatureBench can be easily scaled and updated over time to mitigate data leakage. The inherent verifiability of constructed environments also makes our method potentially valuable for agent training.", "AI": {"tldr": "FeatureBench\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7279\u6027\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7f16\u7801\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4ece\u4ee3\u7801\u4ed3\u5e93\u63d0\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u80fd\u5b8c\u621011%\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7406\u7f16\u7801\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u8303\u56f4\u6709\u9650\uff08\u5982\u4ec5\u4fee\u590d\u5355\u4e2aPR\u4e2d\u7684bug\uff09\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u975e\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u3002\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6267\u884c\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fe\u4ece\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8ffd\u8e2a\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u4ece\u4ee3\u7801\u4ed3\u5e93\u63d0\u53d6\u8de8\u591a\u4e2a\u63d0\u4ea4\u548cPR\u7684\u7279\u6027\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u529f\u80fd\u5206\u79bb\u540e\u5176\u4ed6\u7279\u6027\u6b63\u5e38\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u4ece24\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u4ed3\u5e93\u6784\u5efa\u4e86200\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u548c3825\u4e2a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u73af\u5883\u3002Claude 4.5 Opus\u5728SWE-bench\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523074.4%\u89e3\u51b3\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5728FeatureBench\u4e0a\u4ec5\u5b8c\u621011.0%\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "FeatureBench\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee3\u7406\u7f16\u7801\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5176\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u6536\u96c6\u5de5\u5177\u4fbf\u4e8e\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u53ef\u51cf\u8f7b\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u9732\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u73af\u5883\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e5f\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

A Study of Cultural Novelty in Recipe Generation", "comment": "14 pages, 12 figures, conference", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate and shape cultural content, ranging from narrative writing to artistic production. While these models demonstrate impressive fluency and generative capacity, prior work has shown that they also exhibit systematic cultural biases, raising concerns about stereotyping, homogenization, and the erasure of culturally specific forms of expression. Understanding whether LLMs can meaningfully align with diverse cultures beyond the dominant ones remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we study cultural adaptation in LLMs through the lens of cooking recipes, a domain in which culture, tradition, and creativity are tightly intertwined. We build on the \\textit{GlobalFusion} dataset, which pairs human recipes from different countries according to established measures of cultural distance. Using the same country pairs, we generate culturally adapted recipes with multiple LLMs, enabling a direct comparison between human and LLM behavior in cross-cultural content creation. Our analysis shows that LLMs fail to produce culturally representative adaptations. Unlike humans, the divergence of their generated recipes does not correlate with cultural distance. We further provide explanations for this gap. We show that cultural information is weakly preserved in internal model representations, that models inflate novelty in their production by misunderstanding notions such as creativity and tradition, and that they fail to identify adaptation with its associated countries and to ground it in culturally salient elements such as ingredients. These findings highlight fundamental limitations of current LLMs for culturally oriented generation and have important implications for their use in culturally sensitive applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u5728\u6587\u5316\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u6587\u5316\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u98df\u8c31\u6539\u7f16\uff0c\u5176\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0e\u6587\u5316\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u6587\u5316\u654f\u611f\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6839\u672c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5851\u9020\u6587\u5316\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6587\u5316\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u62c5\u5fc3\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u3001\u540c\u8d28\u5316\u548c\u6587\u5316\u7279\u5b9a\u8868\u8fbe\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u6d88\u5931\u3002\u7406\u89e3LLMs\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e3b\u6d41\u6587\u5316\u800c\u771f\u6b63\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u5143\u6587\u5316\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u70f9\u996a\u98df\u8c31\u8fd9\u4e00\u6587\u5316\u3001\u4f20\u7edf\u548c\u521b\u9020\u529b\u7d27\u5bc6\u4ea4\u7ec7\u7684\u9886\u57df\u7814\u7a76LLMs\u7684\u6587\u5316\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u4f7f\u7528GlobalFusion\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6839\u636e\u6587\u5316\u8ddd\u79bb\u6d4b\u91cf\u914d\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u98df\u8c31\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u56fd\u5bb6\u914d\u5bf9\uff0c\u7528\u591a\u4e2aLLMs\u751f\u6210\u6587\u5316\u9002\u5e94\u98df\u8c31\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u6bd4\u8f83\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cLLM\u5728\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u5185\u5bb9\u521b\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u65e0\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u6587\u5316\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u98df\u8c31\u3002\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0d\u540c\uff0cLLMs\u751f\u6210\u7684\u98df\u8c31\u5dee\u5f02\u4e0e\u6587\u5316\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a\u6587\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u4fdd\u5b58\u8f83\u5f31\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u8bef\u89e3\u521b\u9020\u6027\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u7b49\u6982\u5ff5\u6765\u5938\u5927\u65b0\u9896\u6027\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5c06\u9002\u5e94\u4e0e\u76f8\u5173\u56fd\u5bb6\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u5c06\u5176\u5efa\u7acb\u5728\u5982\u98df\u6750\u7b49\u6587\u5316\u663e\u8457\u5143\u7d20\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u6587\u5316\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u6587\u5316\u654f\u611f\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4f7fLLMs\u80fd\u591f\u771f\u6b63\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u5143\u6587\u5316\u3002"}}

Many existing approaches to constructing post-training data quantify diversity using text-based metrics that capture linguistic variation, but such metrics provide only weak signals for the task-relevant features that determine downstream performance. In this work, we introduce Feature Activation Coverage (FAC) which measures data diversity in an interpretable feature space. Building upon this metric, we further propose a diversity-driven data synthesis framework, named FAC Synthesis, that first uses a sparse autoencoder to identify missing features from a seed dataset, and then generates synthetic samples that explicitly reflect these features. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves both data diversity and downstream performance on various tasks, including instruction following, toxicity detection, reward modeling, and behavior steering. Interestingly, we identify a shared, interpretable feature space across model families (i.e., LLaMA, Mistral, and Qwen), enabling cross-model knowledge transfer.

We propose Blockwise Advantage Estimation, a family of GRPO-compatible methods that assigns each objective its own advantage and applies it only to the tokens in the corresponding text block, reducing reliance on hand-designed scalar rewards and scaling naturally to additional objectives. A key challenge is estimating advantages for later blocks whose rewards are conditioned on sampled prefixes; standard unbiased approaches require expensive nested rollouts from intermediate states. Concretely, we introduce an Outcome-Conditioned Baseline that approximates intermediate state values using only within-group statistics by stratifying samples according to a prefix-derived intermediate outcome. On math tasks with uncertainty estimation, our method mitigates reward interference, is competitive with a state-of-the-art reward-designed approach, and preserves test-time gains from confidence-weighted ensembling.

While automated deepfake detectors are increasingly deployed in moderation and investigative pipelines, most existing systems provide only point predictions and fail to indicate when outputs are unreliable, being an operationally critical limitation in high-stakes political contexts. This work investigates conditional, uncertainty-aware political deepfake detection using stochastic convolutional neural networks within an empirical, decision-oriented reliability framework. Rather than treating uncertainty as a purely Bayesian construct, it is evaluated through observable criteria, including calibration quality, proper scoring rules, and its alignment with prediction errors under both global and confidence-conditioned analyses. A politically focused binary image dataset is constructed via deterministic metadata filtering from a large public real-synthetic corpus. Two pretrained CNN backbones (ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B4) are fully fine-tuned for classification. Deterministic inference is compared with single-pass stochastic prediction, Monte Carlo dropout with multiple forward passes, temperature scaling, and ensemble-based uncertainty surrogates.

A key challenge is the scarcity of evaluation testbeds that combine the complexity of software development with the need for deep multimodal understanding. Game development provides such a testbed as agents must navigate large, dense codebases while manipulating intrinsically multimodal assets such as shaders, sprites, and animations within a visual game scene. We present GameDevBench, the first benchmark for evaluating agents on game development tasks. GameDevBench consists of 132 tasks derived from web and video tutorials. Tasks require significant multimodal understanding and are complex -- the average solution requires over three times the amount of lines of code and file changes compared to prior software development benchmarks. Agents still struggle with game development, with the best agent solving only 54.5% of tasks. We find a strong correlation between perceived task difficulty and multimodal complexity, with success rates dropping from 46.9% on gameplay-oriented tasks to 31.6% on 2D graphics tasks. To improve multimodal capability, we introduce two simple image and video-based feedback mechanisms for agents. Despite their simplicity, these methods consistently improve performance, with the largest change being an increase in Claude Sonnet 4.5's performance from 33.3% to 47.7%.

To address this, based on an analogy between the Dockerfile and the agentic task, we propose to employ agents to simulate and explore environment histories, guided by execution feedback. By tracing histories of a healthy environment, its state can be inverted to an earlier one with runtime failures, from which a task can be derived by packing the buggy state and the corresponding error messages. With our method, named CLI-Gym, a total of 1,655 environment-intensive tasks are derived, being the largest collection of its kind. Moreover, with curated successful trajectories, our fine-tuned model, named LiberCoder, achieves substantial absolute improvements of +21.1% (to 46.1%) on Terminal-Bench, outperforming various strong baselines.

We show that our levels of anxiety on social media exhibit systematic patterns of rise and fall during the day -- highest at 8am (in-line with when we have high cortisol levels in the body) and lowest around noon. Anxiety is lowest on weekends and highest mid-week. We also examine anxiety in past, present, and future tense sentences to show that anxiety is highest in past tense and lowest in future tense. Finally, we examine the use of anxiety and calmness words in posts that contain pronouns to show: more anxiety in 3rd person pronouns (he, they) posts than 1st and 2nd person pronouns and higher anxiety in posts with subject pronouns (I, he, she, they) than object pronouns (me, him, her, them). Overall, these trends provide valuable insights on not just when we are anxious, but also how different types of focus (future, past, self, outward, etc.) are related to anxiety.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7126\u8651\u8bcd\u6c47\u8bcd\u5178\u5206\u6790\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7126\u8651\u6c34\u5e73\u5728\u4e00\u5929\u4e2d\u5448\u73b0\u89c4\u5f8b\u53d8\u5316\uff1a\u65e9\u4e0a8\u70b9\u6700\u9ad8\uff08\u4e0e\u76ae\u8d28\u9187\u9ad8\u5cf0\u4e00\u81f4\uff09\uff0c\u4e2d\u5348\u6700\u4f4e\uff1b\u5468\u672b\u6700\u4f4e\uff0c\u5468\u4e2d\u6700\u9ad8\uff1b\u8fc7\u53bb\u65f6\u53e5\u5b50\u7126\u8651\u6700\u9ad8\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u65f6\u6700\u4f4e\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e09\u4eba\u79f0\u4ee3\u8bcd\u5e16\u5b50\u7126\u8651\u9ad8\u4e8e\u7b2c\u4e00\u3001\u4e8c\u4eba\u79f0\uff0c\u4e3b\u8bed\u4ee3\u8bcd\u5e16\u5b50\u7126\u8651\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5bbe\u8bed\u4ee3\u8bcd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5229\u7528\u65b0\u521b\u5efa\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47-\u7126\u8651\u5173\u8054\u8bcd\u5178\u5206\u6790\u5927\u91cf\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4eba\u4eec\u4f55\u65f6\u611f\u5230\u7126\u8651\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u54ea\u4e9b\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u7126\u8651\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u5173\u6ce8\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u8fc7\u53bb/\u672a\u6765/\u81ea\u6211/\u4ed6\u4eba\uff09\u4e0e\u7126\u8651\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u8fd1\u521b\u5efa\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47-\u7126\u8651\u5173\u8054\u8bcd\u5178\u5206\u6790\u7f8e\u56fd\u548c\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u6570\u636e\uff08\u63a8\u6587\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u6790\u3001\u65f6\u6001\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4ee3\u8bcd\u5206\u6790\u6765\u63a2\u7d22\u7126\u8651\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u7126\u8651\u6c34\u5e73\u5728\u4e00\u5929\u4e2d\u5448\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6ce2\u52a8\uff1a\u65e9\u4e0a8\u70b9\u6700\u9ad8\uff08\u4e0e\u4f53\u5185\u76ae\u8d28\u9187\u9ad8\u5cf0\u4e00\u81f4\uff09\uff0c\u4e2d\u5348\u6700\u4f4e\uff1b\u5468\u672b\u7126\u8651\u6700\u4f4e\uff0c\u5468\u4e2d\u6700\u9ad8\uff1b\u8fc7\u53bb\u65f6\u53e5\u5b50\u7126\u8651\u6700\u9ad8\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u65f6\u6700\u4f4e\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e09\u4eba\u79f0\u4ee3\u8bcd\uff08\u4ed6/\u4ed6\u4eec\uff09\u5e16\u5b50\u7126\u8651\u9ad8\u4e8e\u7b2c\u4e00\u3001\u4e8c\u4eba\u79f0\uff1b\u4e3b\u8bed\u4ee3\u8bcd\uff08\u6211/\u4ed6/\u5979/\u4ed6\u4eec\uff09\u5e16\u5b50\u7126\u8651\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5bbe\u8bed\u4ee3\u8bcd\uff08\u6211/\u4ed6/\u5979/\u4ed6\u4eec\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8d8b\u52bf\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4eba\u4eec\u4f55\u65f6\u611f\u5230\u7126\u8651\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5173\u6ce8\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u672a\u6765\u3001\u8fc7\u53bb\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u3001\u5916\u5411\u7b49\uff09\u4e0e\u7126\u8651\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u7126\u8651\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u7ef4\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

A patient with a rare disease combination or a transaction with unusual characteristics stands out from the crowd. Differential privacy provides worst-case guarantees, but empirical attacks -- particularly membership inference -- succeed far more often against such outliers, especially under moderate privacy budgets and with auxiliary information.\n  This paper introduces risk-equalized DP synthesis, a framework that prioritizes protection for high-risk records by reducing their influence on the learned generator. The mechanism operates in two stages: first, a small privacy budget estimates each record's \"outlierness\"; second, a DP learning procedure weights each record inversely to its risk score. Under Gaussian mechanisms, a record's privacy loss is proportional to its influence on the output -- so deliberately shrinking outliers' contributions yields tighter per-instance privacy bounds for precisely those records that need them most.\n  We prove end-to-end DP guarantees via composition and derive closed-form per-record bounds for the synthesis stage (the scoring stage adds a uniform per-record term). Experiments on simulated data with controlled outlier injection show that risk-weighting substantially reduces membership inference success against high-outlierness records; ablations confirm that targeting -- not random downweighting -- drives the improvement. On real-world benchmarks (Breast Cancer, Adult, German Credit), gains are dataset-dependent, highlighting the interplay between scorer quality and synthesis pipeline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u98ce\u9669\u5747\u8861\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u5408\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u8bb0\u5f55\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u53d1\u5e03\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f02\u5e38\u8bb0\u5f55\uff08\u5982\u7f55\u89c1\u75be\u75c5\u7ec4\u5408\u6216\u5f02\u5e38\u4ea4\u6613\uff09\u6bd4\u666e\u901a\u8bb0\u5f55\u66f4\u96be\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f46\u7ecf\u9a8c\u653b\u51fb\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\uff09\u5bf9\u8fd9\u7c7b\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u9690\u79c1\u9884\u7b97\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u4fe1\u606f\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u673a\u5236\uff1a1\uff09\u7528\u5c0f\u9690\u79c1\u9884\u7b97\u4f30\u8ba1\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\"\u5f02\u5e38\u5ea6\"\uff1b2\uff09\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6839\u636e\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u6570\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bb0\u5f55\u8fdb\u884c\u9006\u6743\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u3002\u5728\u9ad8\u65af\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\uff0c\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u635f\u5931\u4e0e\u5176\u5bf9\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u51cf\u5c11\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u8bb0\u5f55\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6bcf\u5b9e\u4f8b\u9690\u79c1\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u98ce\u9669\u52a0\u6743\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5f02\u5e38\u5ea6\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u786e\u8ba4\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u52a0\u6743\u800c\u975e\u968f\u673a\u964d\u6743\u9a71\u52a8\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u3001\u6210\u4eba\u3001\u5fb7\u56fd\u4fe1\u7528\uff09\u4e0a\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u8bc4\u5206\u5668\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u98ce\u9669\u5747\u8861\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u5408\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u8bb0\u5f55\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6574\u4f53\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4e3a\u6700\u9700\u8981\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u8bb0\u5f55\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u8fb9\u754c\u3002"}}

While maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) provides a principled framework for speckle mitigation, its application to coherent imaging system such as digital holography with finite apertures is hindered by the prohibitive cost of high-dimensional matrix inversion, especially at high resolutions. This computational burden has prevented the use of MLE-based reconstruction with physically accurate aperture modeling. In this work, we propose a randomized linear algebra approach that enables scalable MLE optimization without explicit matrix inversions in gradient computation. By exploiting the structural properties of sensing matrix and using conjugate gradient for likelihood gradient evaluation, the proposed algorithm supports accurate aperture modeling without the simplifying assumptions commonly imposed for tractability. We term the resulting method projected gradient descent with Monte Carlo estimation (PGD-MC). The proposed PGD-MC framework (i) demonstrates robustness to diverse and physically accurate aperture models, (ii) achieves substantial improvements in reconstruction quality and computational efficiency, and (iii) scales effectively to high-resolution digital holography. Extensive experiments incorporating three representative denoisers as regularization show that PGD-MC provides a flexible and effective MLE-based reconstruction framework for digital holography with finite apertures, consistently outperforming prior Plug-and-Play model-based iterative reconstruction methods in both accuracy and speed.

This paradigm overlooks the rich dependencies inherent in realistic visual streams, where information is distributed across temporal sequences rather than confined to single snapshots. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepImageSearch, a novel agentic paradigm that reformulates image retrieval as an autonomous exploration task. Models must plan and perform multi-step reasoning over raw visual histories to locate targets based on implicit contextual cues. We construct DISBench, a challenging benchmark built on interconnected visual data. To address the scalability challenge of creating context-dependent queries, we propose a human-model collaborative pipeline that employs vision-language models to mine latent spatiotemporal associations, effectively offloading intensive context discovery before human verification. Furthermore, we build a robust baseline using a modular agent framework equipped with fine-grained tools and a dual-memory system for long-horizon navigation.

These embeddings predict students' skills across multiple programming topics, producing profiles that are matched to the skills required by unseen homework problems. To generate recommendations, we compute the cosine similarity between student profiles and problem skill vectors, ranking exercises according to their alignment with each student's current abilities. We evaluated our approach using real data from students and exercises in an introductory programming course at our university. First, we assessed the effectiveness of our source code embeddings for predicting skills, comparing them with token-based and graph-based alternatives. Results showed that Jina embeddings outperformed TF-IDF, CodeBERT-cpp, and GraphCodeBERT across most skills. Additionally, we evaluated the system's ability to recommend exercises aligned with weekly course content by analyzing student submissions collected over seven course offerings.

This paradigm of opportunistic imaging adds value to medical imaging without additional imaging costs or patient radiation exposure. However, many open-source image analysis solutions lack rigorous validation while commercial solutions lack transparency, leading to unexpected failures when deployed. Here, we report development and validation for two of the first fully open-sourced, FDA-510(k)-cleared deep learning pipelines to mitigate both challenges: Abdominal Aortic Quantification (AAQ) and Bone Mineral Density (BMD) estimation are both offered within the Comp2Comp package for opportunistic analysis of computed tomography scans. AAQ segments the abdominal aorta to assess aneurysm size; BMD segments vertebral bodies to estimate trabecular bone density and osteoporosis risk. AAQ-derived maximal aortic diameters were compared against radiologist ground-truth measurements on 258 patient scans enriched for abdominal aortic aneurysms from four external institutions. BMD binary classifications (low vs. normal bone density) were compared against concurrent DXA scan ground truths obtained on 371 patient scans from four external institutions. AAQ had an overall mean absolute error of 1.57 mm (95% CI 1.38-1.80 mm). BMD had a sensitivity of 81.0% (95% CI 74.0-86.8%) and specificity of 78.4% (95% CI 72.3-83.7%). Comp2Comp AAQ and BMD demonstrated sufficient accuracy for clinical use. Open-sourcing these algorithms improves transparency of typically opaque FDA clearance processes, allows hospitals to test the algorithms before cumbersome clinical pilots, and provides researchers with best-in-class methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u9996\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u5f00\u6e90\u3001FDA-510(k)\u6279\u51c6\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7ba1\u9053\uff08AAQ\u548cBMD\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4eceCT\u626b\u63cf\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u6210\u50cf\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u8db3\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5f00\u6e90\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e25\u683c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5546\u4e1a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7f3a\u4e4f\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\u610f\u5916\u5931\u8d25\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u65e2\u900f\u660e\u53c8\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4e25\u683c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7ba1\u9053\uff1aAAQ\uff08\u8179\u4e3b\u52a8\u8109\u91cf\u5316\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u5272\u8179\u4e3b\u52a8\u8109\u8bc4\u4f30\u52a8\u8109\u7624\u5927\u5c0f\uff1bBMD\uff08\u9aa8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u5272\u690e\u4f53\u8bc4\u4f30\u9aa8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u9aa8\u8d28\u758f\u677e\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u4e24\u8005\u90fd\u5305\u542b\u5728Comp2Comp\u5305\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5916\u90e8\u673a\u6784\u7684\u60a3\u8005\u626b\u63cf\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "AAQ\u5728258\u4f8b\u60a3\u8005\u626b\u63cf\u4e0a\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a1.57mm\uff0895% CI 1.38-1.80mm\uff09\u3002BMD\u5728371\u4f8b\u60a3\u8005\u626b\u63cf\u4e0a\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4e3a81.0%\uff0895% CI 74.0-86.8%\uff09\uff0c\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u4e3a78.4%\uff0895% CI 72.3-83.7%\uff09\u3002\u4e24\u8005\u90fd\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u8db3\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Comp2Comp AAQ\u548cBMD\u7b97\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u5f00\u6e90\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86FDA\u5ba1\u6279\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u533b\u9662\u5728\u7e41\u7410\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u70b9\u524d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While multimodal content offers a promising solution, existing methods result in suboptimal representations for new items due to noise and entanglement in sparse data. To address this, we transform multimodal recommendation into discrete semantic tokenization. We present Sparse-Regularized Multimodal Tokenization for Cold-Start Recommendation (MoToRec), a framework centered on a sparsely-regularized Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RQ-VAE) that generates a compositional semantic code of discrete, interpretable tokens, promoting disentangled representations. MoToRec's architecture is enhanced by three synergistic components: (1) a sparsely-regularized RQ-VAE that promotes disentangled representations, (2) a novel adaptive rarity amplification that promotes prioritized learning for cold-start items, and (3) a hierarchical multi-source graph encoder for robust signal fusion with collaborative signals. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate MoToRec's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both overall and cold-start scenarios. Our work validates that discrete tokenization provides an effective and scalable alternative for mitigating the long-standing cold-start challenge.", "AI": {"tldr": "MoToRec\u63d0\u51fa\u7a00\u758f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ee4\u724c\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u6563\u8bed\u4e49\u4ee4\u724c\u89e3\u51b3\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u7269\u54c1\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4ea4\u4e92\u5386\u53f2\u6709\u9650\u7684\u65b0\u7269\u54c1\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u7531\u4e8e\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7ea0\u7f20\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b21\u4f18\u8868\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u8350\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u8bed\u4e49\u4ee4\u724c\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u51faMoToRec\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\uff1a1\uff09\u7a00\u758f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u91cf\u5316\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u4ee4\u724c\uff1b2\uff09\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7a00\u6709\u6027\u653e\u5927\u673a\u5236\u4f18\u5148\u5b66\u4e60\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u7269\u54c1\uff1b3\uff09\u5206\u5c42\u591a\u6e90\u56fe\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u878d\u5408\u534f\u540c\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMoToRec\u5728\u6574\u4f53\u548c\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u79bb\u6563\u4ee4\u724c\u5316\u5728\u7f13\u89e3\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u6311\u6218\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u79bb\u6563\u4ee4\u724c\u5316\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u671f\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

The dominant oversight paradigm, LLM-as-a-Judge, faces a fundamental dilemma: how can probabilistic systems reliably supervise other probabilistic systems without inheriting their failure modes? We argue that formal verification offers a principled escape from this dilemma, yet its adoption has been hindered by a critical bottleneck: the translation from natural language requirements to formal specifications. This paper bridges this gap by proposing , a neuro-symbolic framework that employs a bidirectional Formal-of-Thought architecture: LLMs serve as specification compilers that top-down decompose high-level human intent into atomic, verifiable constraints, then bottom-up prove compliance using Dafny specifications and Z3 Satisfiability modulo theories solving, which produces mathematical guarantees rather than probabilistic scores. We validate across three benchmarks spanning behavioral safety, multi-domain constraint adherence, and agentic upward deception detection. Experiments on 7 agent models demonstrate that achieves an average improvement of 16.6% over LLM-as-a-Judge baselines, enables weak-to-strong generalization where a 7B judge achieves over 90% accuracy detecting deception from 72B agents, and provides near-linear safety improvement through iterative refinement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faFoT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLM\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u9700\u6c42\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Dafny\u548cZ3\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570\u5b66\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7684LLM-as-a-Judge\u76d1\u7763\u8303\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u56f0\u5883\uff1a\u6982\u7387\u7cfb\u7edf\u5982\u4f55\u53ef\u9760\u76d1\u7763\u5176\u4ed6\u6982\u7387\u7cfb\u7edf\u800c\u4e0d\u7ee7\u627f\u5176\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1f\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u539f\u5219\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u9700\u6c42\u5230\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFoT\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5411\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u601d\u7ef4\u67b6\u6784\uff1aLLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c4\u8303\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\uff0c\u81ea\u4e0a\u800c\u4e0b\u5c06\u9ad8\u7ea7\u4eba\u7c7b\u610f\u56fe\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u539f\u5b50\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u81ea\u4e0b\u800c\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528Dafny\u89c4\u8303\u548cZ3 SMT\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u8bc1\u660e\u5408\u89c4\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570\u5b66\u4fdd\u8bc1\u800c\u975e\u6982\u7387\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08\u884c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u591a\u9886\u57df\u7ea6\u675f\u9075\u5b88\u3001\u4ee3\u7406\u5411\u4e0a\u6b3a\u9a97\u68c0\u6d4b\uff09\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5bf97\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFoT\u76f8\u6bd4LLM-as-a-Judge\u57fa\u7ebf\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u534716.6%\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f31\u5230\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\uff087B\u6cd5\u5b98\u68c0\u6d4b72B\u4ee3\u7406\u6b3a\u9a97\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d8590%\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ec6\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7ebf\u6027\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "FoT\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u6865\u63a5\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u9700\u6c42\u5230\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u5b66\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u76d1\u7763\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6982\u7387\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Multiple kernel learning (MKL) addresses these limitations by constructing composite kernels from simpler ones and integrating information from heterogeneous sources.

Despite recent progress, existing hallucination mitigation methods often overlook the underlying hallucination patterns driven by language bias. In this work, we design a novel pipeline to accurately synthesize Hallucination-Inducing Images (HIIs). Using synthesized HIIs, we reveal a consistent scene-conditioned hallucination pattern: models tend to mention objects that are highly typical of the scene even when visual evidence is removed. To quantify the susceptibility of VLMs to this hallucination pattern, we establish the Masked-Object-Hallucination (MOH) benchmark to rigorously evaluate existing state-of-the-art alignment frameworks. Finally, we leverage HIIs to construct high-quality preference datasets for fine-grained alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates hallucinations while preserving general model capabilities.

By leveraging bidirectional attention through diffusion-based pretraining, our models capture comprehensive bidirectional context within passages, enabling the use of mean pooling and a late chunking strategy to better preserve global context across long documents. We release two model types: pplx-embed-v1 for standard retrieval, and pplx-embed-context-v1 for contextualized embeddings that incorporate global document context into passage representations. pplx-embed-v1 achieves competitive performance on the MTEB(Multilingual, v2), MTEB(Code), MIRACL, BERGEN, and ToolRet retrieval benchmarks, while pplx-embed-context-v1 sets new records on the ConTEB benchmark. Beyond public benchmarks, pplx-embed-v1 demonstrates strong performance on our internal evaluation suite, which focuses on real-world, large-scale search scenarios over tens of millions of documents.

In contrast, Symbolic WMs provide logical consistency but lack semantic expressivity. To bridge this gap, we propose Neuro-Symbolic Synergy (NeSyS), a framework that integrates the probabilistic semantic priors of LLMs with executable symbolic rules to achieve both expressivity and robustness. NeSyS alternates training between the two models using trajectories inadequately explained by the other. Unlike rule-based prompting, the symbolic WM directly constrains the LLM by modifying its output probability distribution. The neural WM is fine-tuned only on trajectories not covered by symbolic rules, reducing training data by 50% without loss of accuracy. Extensive experiments on three distinct interactive environments, i.e., ScienceWorld, Webshop, and Plancraft, demonstrate NeSyS's consistent advantages over baselines in both WM prediction accuracy and data efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "NeSyS\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u66ff\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u73b0\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4ea4\u4e92\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5", "motivation": "LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u4e25\u683c\u9075\u5b88\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8f6c\u6362\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u89d2\u843d\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff1b\u800c\u7b26\u53f7\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u4f9b\u903b\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u534f\u540c\u6846\u67b6NeSyS\uff0c\u5c06LLM\u7684\u6982\u7387\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u89c4\u5219\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u66ff\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u65b9\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u7b26\u53f7\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u76f4\u63a5\u4fee\u6539LLM\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u800c\u795e\u7ecf\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u89c4\u5219\u672a\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728ScienceWorld\u3001Webshop\u548cPlancraft\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cNeSyS\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u51cf\u5c1150%\u800c\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "NeSyS\u6210\u529f\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, current methods often struggle to capture long-range dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency.

Drawing inspiration from the recent success of Titans in language tasks, we present ChangeTitans, the Titans-based framework for remote sensing change detection. Specifically, we propose VTitans, the first Titans-based vision backbone that integrates neural memory with segmented local attention, thereby capturing long-range dependencies while mitigating computational overhead. Next, we present a hierarchical VTitans-Adapter to refine multi-scale features across different network layers. Finally, we introduce TS-CBAM, a two-stream fusion module leveraging cross-temporal attention to suppress pseudo-changes and enhance detection accuracy.

We observe that even when auxiliary visual elements are interleaved, they are often treated as static snapshots within a one-dimensional, unstructured reasoning chain. We argue that such approaches treat reasoning history as an immutable stream: correcting a local error necessitates either generating verbose downstream corrections or regenerating the entire context. This forces the model to implicitly maintain and track state updates, significantly increasing token consumption and cognitive load. This limitation is particularly acute in high-dimensional domains, such as geometry and SVG design, where the textual expression of CoT lacks explicit visual guidance, further constraining the model's reasoning precision. To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textbf{Canvas-of-Thought (Canvas-CoT)}. By leveraging a HTML Canvas as an external reasoning substrate, Canvas-CoT empowers the model to perform atomic, DOM-based CRUD operations. This architecture enables in-place state revisions without disrupting the surrounding context, allowing the model to explicitly maintain the \"ground truth\". Furthermore, we integrate a rendering-based critique loop that serves as a hard constraint validator, providing explicit visual feedback to resolve complex tasks that are difficult to articulate through text alone.

We introduce Linear-LLM-SCM, a plug-and-play benchmarking framework for evaluating LLMs on linear Gaussian structural causal model (SCM) parametrization when the DAG is given. The framework decomposes a DAG into local parent-child sets and prompts an LLM to produce a regression-style structural equation per node, which is aggregated and compared against available ground-truth parameters.

We identify pseudo-detoxification as a common failure mode, where apparent toxicity reductions arise from degenerate generation behaviours rather than meaningful suppression of unsafe content. We further show that detoxification effectiveness degrades when multiple unsafe behaviours are edited jointly, and that both monolingual and cross-lingual detoxification remain effective only under specific model-method combinations.

However, its spatial behavior lacks rigorous understanding from a physical systems perspective, leading to reliance on heuristics for hyperparameter selection. This work introduces a novel analytical approach that characterizes MHE by examining its Point Spread Function (PSF), which is analogous to the Green's function of the system. This methodology enables a quantification of the encoding's spatial resolution and fidelity. We derive a closed-form approximation for the collision-free PSF, uncovering inherent grid-induced anisotropy and a logarithmic spatial profile. We establish that the idealized spatial bandwidth, specifically the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM), is determined by the average resolution, $N_{\\text{avg}}$. This leads to a counterintuitive finding: the effective resolution of the model is governed by the broadened empirical FWHM (and therefore $N_{\\text{avg}}$), rather than the finest resolution $N_{\\max}$, a broadening effect we demonstrate arises from optimization dynamics. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of finite hash capacity, demonstrating how collisions introduce speckle noise and degrade the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). Leveraging these theoretical insights, we propose Rotated MHE (R-MHE), an architecture that applies distinct rotations to the input coordinates at each resolution level. R-MHE mitigates anisotropy while maintaining the efficiency and parameter count of the original MHE.

Their reliable execution critically depends on the ability to reason through ambiguous situations in which clarification seeking is necessary to ensure correct task execution. However, progress is limited by the lack of scalable, task-agnostic frameworks for systematically curating and measuring the impact of ambiguity across custom workflows. We address this gap by introducing LHAW (Long-Horizon Augmented Workflows), a modular, dataset-agnostic synthetic pipeline that transforms any well-specified task into controllable underspecified variants by systematically removing information across four dimensions - Goals, Constraints, Inputs, and Context - at configurable severity levels. Unlike approaches that rely on LLM predictions of ambiguity, LHAW validates variants through empirical agent trials, classifying them as outcome-critical, divergent, or benign based on observed terminal state divergence. We release 285 task variants from TheAgentCompany, SWE-Bench Pro and MCP-Atlas according to our taxonomy alongside formal analysis measuring how current agents detect, reason about, and resolve underspecification across ambiguous settings.

Because no simple functional form can express this mapping, we parameterize it with a large language model (LLM), and fit it with diverse open-source pretraining logs across multiple sources, yielding a \\textit{Neural} Configuration-to-Performance Scaling Law (NCPL). NCPL accurately predicts how training configurations influence the final pretraining loss, achieving 20-40% lower prediction error than the configuration-agnostic Chinchilla law and generalizing to runs using up to 10 x more compute than any run in the training set.

It's a diverse dataset covering 10 common household waste categories: metal, glass, biological, paper, battery, trash, cardboard, shoes, clothes, and plastic. The dataset comprises 13,348 labeled images collected through multiple methods, including DWaste mobile app and curated web sources. Methods included rigorous validation through checksums and outlier detection, analysis of class imbalance and visual separability via PCA/t-SNE, and assessment of background complexity using entropy and saliency measures. The dataset was benchmarked using state-of-the-art deep learning models (EfficientNetV2M, EfficientNetV2S, MobileNet, ResNet50, ResNet101) evaluated on performance metrics and operational carbon emissions. Experiment results indicate EfficientNetV2S achieved the highest performance with 96.19% accuracy and a 0.96 F1-score, though with a moderate carbon cost. Analysis revealed inherent dataset characteristics including class imbalance, a skew toward high-outlier classes (plastic, cardboard, paper), and brightness variations that require consideration. The main conclusion is that GD provides a valuable, real-world benchmark for waste classification research while highlighting important challenges such as class imbalance, background complexity, and environmental trade-offs in model selection that must be addressed for practical deployment.

Recent work MemAgent has tried to tackle this by processing context chunk-by-chunk in an RNN-like loop and updating a textual memory for final answering. However, this naive recurrent memory update faces two crucial drawbacks: (i) memory can quickly explode because it can update indiscriminately, even on evidence-free chunks; and (ii) the loop lacks an exit mechanism, leading to unnecessary computation after even sufficient evidence is collected. To address these issues, we propose GRU-Mem, which incorporates two text-controlled gates for more stable and efficient long-context reasoning. Specifically, in GRU-Mem, the memory only updates when the update gate is open and the recurrent loop will exit immediately once the exit gate is open. To endow the model with such capabilities, we introduce two reward signals $r^{\\text{update}}$ and $r^{\\text{exit}}$ within end-to-end RL, rewarding the correct updating and exiting behaviors respectively. Experiments on various long-context reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of GRU-Mem, which generally outperforms the vanilla MemAgent with up to 400\\% times inference speed acceleration.", "AI": {"tldr": "GRU-Mem\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6587\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\uff08\u66f4\u65b0\u95e8\u548c\u9000\u51fa\u95e8\uff09\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86MemAgent\u4e2d\u5185\u5b58\u7206\u70b8\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9000\u51fa\u673a\u5236\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MemAgent\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a1\uff09\u5185\u5b58\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u65e0\u5dee\u522b\u66f4\u65b0\u800c\u7206\u70b8\u6027\u589e\u957f\uff1b2\uff09\u5faa\u73af\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9000\u51fa\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u6536\u96c6\u8db3\u591f\u8bc1\u636e\u540e\u4ecd\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGRU-Mem\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u4e2a\u6587\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u95e8\u63a7\uff1a\u66f4\u65b0\u95e8\u63a7\u5236\u5185\u5b58\u66f4\u65b0\uff08\u4ec5\u5728\u9700\u8981\u65f6\u66f4\u65b0\uff09\uff0c\u9000\u51fa\u95e8\u63a7\u5236\u5faa\u73af\u9000\u51fa\uff08\u6536\u96c6\u8db3\u591f\u8bc1\u636e\u540e\u7acb\u5373\u505c\u6b62\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u522b\u5956\u52b1\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u9000\u51fa\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGRU-Mem\u901a\u5e38\u4f18\u4e8e\u539f\u59cbMemAgent\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\u53ef\u52a0\u901f400%\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5904\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "GRU-Mem\u901a\u8fc7\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u7206\u70b8\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u957f\u6587\u6863\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

ICODEN does not require the proportional hazards assumption or a prespecified parametric form for the hazard function, thereby permitting flexible survival modeling. Across simulation settings with proportional or non-proportional hazards and both linear and nonlinear covariate effects, ICODEN consistently achieves satisfactory predictive accuracy and remains stable as the number of predictors increases. Applications to data from multiple phases of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and to two Age-Related Eye Disease Studies (AREDS and AREDS2) for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) demonstrate ICODEN's robust prediction performance. In both applications, predicting time-to-AD or time-to-late AMD, ICODEN effectively uses hundreds to more than 1,000 SNPs and supports data-driven subgroup identification with differential progression risk profiles.

We introduce Med-SegLens, a model-diffing framework that decomposes segmentation model activations into interpretable latent features using sparse autoencoders trained on SegFormer and U-Net. Through cross-architecture and cross-dataset latent alignment across healthy, adult, pediatric, and sub-Saharan African glioma cohorts, we identify a stable backbone of shared representations, while dataset shift is driven by differential reliance on population-specific latents. We show that these latents act as causal bottlenecks for segmentation failures, and that targeted latent-level interventions can correct errors and improve cross-dataset adaption without retraining, recovering performance in 70% of failure cases and improving Dice score from 39.4% to 74.2%. Our results demonstrate that latent-level model diffing provides a practical and mechanistic tool for diagnosing failures and mitigating dataset shift in segmentation models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Med-SegLens\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5dee\u5f02\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5c06\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bca\u65ad\u5931\u8d25\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u504f\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8bca\u65ad\u5931\u8d25\u3001\u7406\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u504f\u79fb\u6216\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u539f\u5219\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728SegFormer\u548cU-Net\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5c06\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5bf9\u9f50\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u4eba\u7fa4\uff08\u5065\u5eb7\u3001\u6210\u4eba\u3001\u513f\u7ae5\u3001\u6492\u54c8\u62c9\u4ee5\u5357\u975e\u6d32\u80f6\u8d28\u7624\uff09\u7684\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u8868\u793a\u9aa8\u5e72\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u504f\u79fb\u7531\u5bf9\u4eba\u7fa4\u7279\u5b9a\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5dee\u5f02\u9a71\u52a8\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5206\u5272\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5e72\u9884\u53ef\u4ee5\u7ea0\u6b63\u9519\u8bef\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u6062\u590d70%\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u5c06Dice\u5206\u6570\u4ece39.4%\u63d0\u5347\u523074.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6f5c\u5728\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5dee\u5f02\u5206\u6790\u4e3a\u8bca\u65ad\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u8d25\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u504f\u79fb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u673a\u5236\u6027\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

While delta-tuning has proven effective in boosting the performance and efficiency of LLMs during adaptation, its advantages cannot be directly transferred to the fine-tuning pipeline of vision foundation models. To push the boundaries of adaptation efficiency for vision tasks, we propose an adapter with Complex Linear Projection Optimization (CoLin). For architecture, we design a novel low-rank complex adapter that introduces only about 1% parameters to the backbone. For efficiency, we theoretically prove that low-rank composite matrices suffer from severe convergence issues during training, and address this challenge with a tailored loss. Extensive experiments on object detection, segmentation, image classification, and rotated object detection (remote sensing scenario) demonstrate that CoLin outperforms both full fine-tuning and classical delta-tuning approaches with merely 1% parameters for the first time, providing a novel and efficient solution for deployment of vision foundation models.

To improve stability, recent methods typically use a fixed sequence-level IS ratio for all tokens in a sequence or adjust each token's IS ratio separately, thereby neglecting temporal off-policy derivation across tokens in a sequence. In this paper, we first empirically identify that local off-policy deviation is structurally inconsistent at the token level, which may distort policy-gradient updates across adjacent tokens and lead to training collapse. To address the issue, we propose Online Causal Kalman Filtering for stable and effective Policy Optimization (KPO). Concretely, we model the desired IS ratio as a latent state that evolves across tokens and apply a Kalman filter to update this state online and autoregressively based on the states of past tokens, regardless of future tokens. The resulting filtered IS ratios preserve token-wise local structure-aware variation while strongly smoothing noise spikes, yielding more stable and effective policy updates.

Building on an existing supervised tabular predictor, the framework constructs a reasoning-centric knowledge base composed of labeled tabular records, where each sample includes structured predictors, a compact natural language text-mode summary, and a model-generated reasoning trajectory. During inference, R2RAG-Flood issues context-augmented prompts that retrieve and condition on relevant reasoning trajectories from nearby geospatial neighbors and canonical class prototypes, enabling the large language model backbone to emulate and adapt prior reasoning rather than learn new task-specific parameters. Predictions follow a two-stage procedure that first determines property damage occurrence and then refines severity within a three-level Property Damage Extent categorization, with a conditional downgrade step to correct over-predicted severity. In a case study of Harris County, Texas at the 12-digit Hydrologic Unit Code scale, the supervised tabular baseline trained directly on structured predictors achieves 0.714 overall accuracy and 0.859 damage class accuracy for medium and high damage classes. Across seven large language model backbones, R2RAG-Flood attains 0.613 to 0.668 overall accuracy and 0.757 to 0.896 damage class accuracy, approaching the supervised baseline while additionally producing a structured rationale for each prediction.

However, achieving this remains challenging due to insufficient training data with limited subject identities, narrow audio representations, and restricted explicit controllability. In this paper, we propose 3DXTalker, an expressive 3D talking avatar through data-curated identity modeling, audio-rich representations, and spatial dynamics controllability. 3DXTalker enables scalable identity modeling via 2D-to-3D data curation pipeline and disentangled representations, alleviating data scarcity and improving identity generalization. Then, we introduce frame-wise amplitude and emotional cues beyond standard speech embeddings, ensuring superior lip synchronization and nuanced expression modulation.

In this work, we conduct a systematic study of causal, hybrid, and bidirectional attention masks within a unified contrastive learning framework trained on large-scale real-world Alipay data that integrates long-horizon heterogeneous user behaviors. To improve training dynamics when transitioning from causal to bidirectional attention, we propose Gradient-Guided Soft Masking, a gradient-based pre-warmup applied before a linear scheduler that gradually opens future attention during optimization. Evaluated on 9 industrial user cognition benchmarks covering prediction, preference, and marketing sensitivity tasks, our approach consistently yields more stable training and higher-quality bidirectional representations compared with causal, hybrid, and scheduler-only baselines, while remaining compatible with decoder pretraining. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of masking design and training transition in adapting decoder-only LLMs for effective user representation learning.

By generating sequences in any order and allowing for parallel decoding, they enable fast inference and strong performance on non-causal tasks.

In this work, we propose Progressive UnMAsking (PUMA), a simple modification of the forward masking process that aligns training-time and inference-time masking patterns, thereby focusing optimization on inference-aligned masks and speeding up training.

Reasoning over such knowledge requires models to integrate spatial relationships, visual cues, real-world context, and domain-specific expertise-capabilities that current large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle to exhibit consistently. Yet, datasets used to benchmark VLMs on map-based reasoning remain narrow in scope, restricted to specific domains, and heavily reliant on artificially generated content (outputs from LLMs or pipeline-based methods), offering limited depth for evaluating genuine geospatial reasoning. To address this gap, we present MapVerse, a large-scale benchmark built on real-world maps. It comprises 11,837 human-authored question-answer pairs across 1,025 maps, spanning ten diverse map categories and multiple question categories for each. The dataset provides a rich setting for evaluating map reading, interpretation, and multimodal reasoning.

Existing methods predominately optimize memory management while treating memory extraction as a static process, resulting in poor generalization, where agents accumulate instance-specific noise rather than robust memories. To address this, we propose Unified Memory Extraction and Management (UMEM), a self-evolving agent framework that jointly optimizes a Large Language Model to simultaneous extract and manage memories. To mitigate overfitting to specific instances, we introduce Semantic Neighborhood Modeling and optimize the model with a neighborhood-level marginal utility reward via GRPO. This approach ensures memory generalizability by evaluating memory utility across clusters of semantically related queries. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks demonstrate that UMEM significantly outperforms highly competitive baselines, achieving up to a 10.67% improvement in multi-turn interactive tasks. Futhermore, UMEM maintains a monotonic growth curve during continuous evolution.

Our system uses a novel multi-stage pipeline: first, hybrid filtering (keywords, TF-IDF, cosine similarity, and a \"nudge-term bonus\") reduces the corpus to about 81,000 candidates. Second, we use OpenScholar (quantized LLaMA 3.1 8B) to classify papers and extract structured fields like nudge type and target behavior in a single pass, validated against a JSON schema.\n  We evaluated four configurations on a labeled test set (N=197). The best setup (Title/Abstract/Intro) achieved a 67.0% F1 score and 72.0% recall, ideal for discovery. A high-precision variant using self-consistency (7 randomized passes) achieved 100% precision with 12% recall, demonstrating a tunable trade-off for high-trust use cases.

The generated images are synthesized via state-of-the-art methods, including text-to-image generation (guided by over 10,000 carefully designed prompts), image inpainting, image refinement, and face swapping. Each generated image is annotated with its generation method and category. Inpainting images further include binary masks to indicate inpainted regions, providing rich metadata for analysis. Compared to existing datasets, detection models trained on our dataset demonstrate superior generalization capabilities. Our dataset not only serves as a strong benchmark for evaluating detection methods but also contributes to advancing the robustness of AI-generated image detection techniques. Building upon this, we propose a lightweight detection method based on image noise entropy, which transforms the original image into an entropy tensor of Non-Local Means (NLM) noise before classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models trained on our dataset achieve strong generalization, and our method delivers competitive performance, establishing a solid baseline for future research.

In this work, we investigate whether benchmark performance is primarily driven by the degree of statistical pattern overlap between pre-training corpora and evaluation datasets. We measure this overlap using word-level unigram cross-entropy and word frequency statistics, and perform controlled experiments across $10$ zero-shot benchmarks, $4$ pre-training datasets spanning $8.5\\mathrm{B}$ to $60\\mathrm{B}$ tokens, and model sizes ranging from $400\\mathrm{M}$ to $3\\mathrm{B}$ parameters. Our results demonstrate a robust inverse relationship between word-level unigram cross-entropy and benchmark performance, suggesting that widely used benchmarks are strongly influenced by word overlap between training and evaluation data. Thus, larger pre-training subsets with similar word-level unigram cross-entropy yield improved downstream results, indicating that word frequency statistics play an additional role in shaping benchmark scores.

In this work, we develop a theoretical framework to analyze the training dynamics of contrastive learning with Transformer-based encoders under imbalanced data. Our results reveal that neuron weights evolve through three distinct stages of training, with different dynamics for majority features, minority features, and noise. We further show that minority features reduce representational capacity, increase the need for more complex architectures, and hinder the separation of ground-truth features from noise. Inspired by these neuron-level behaviors, we show that pruning restores performance degraded by imbalance and enhances feature separation, offering both conceptual insights and practical guidance.

Text provides explicit semantic information that can enhance anomaly characterization and reduce false alarms. However, extracting effective text features is challenging due to the inability of general-purpose language models to capture anomaly-specific nuances and the scarcity of relevant descriptions. Furthermore, multimodal fusion often suffers from redundancy and imbalance. To address these issues, we propose a novel text-guided framework.

We focus on subject and object marking determined through various permutations of nominative, ergative, and dative noun forms. A treebank-based approach for the generation of minimal pairs using the Grew query language is implemented. We create a dataset of 370 syntactic tests made up of seven tasks containing 50-70 samples each, where three noun forms are tested in any given sample. Five encoder- and two decoder-only models are evaluated with word- and/or sentence-level accuracy metrics. Regardless of the specific syntactic makeup, models performed worst in assigning the ergative case correctly and strongest in assigning the nominative case correctly. Performance correlated with the overall frequency distribution of the three forms (NOM > DAT > ERG). Though data scarcity is a known issue for low-resource languages, we show that the highly specific role of the ergative along with a lack of available training data likely contributes to poor performance on this case.

However, the inherited Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) introduces limitations for multimodal processing. Specifically, applying 1D temporal positional indices disrupts the continuity of visual features along the column dimension, resulting in spatial locality loss. Moreover, RoPE follows the prior that temporally closer image tokens are more causally related, leading to long-term decay in attention allocation and causing the model to progressively neglect earlier visual tokens as the sequence length increases. To address these issues, we propose C^2RoPE, an improved RoPE that explicitly models local spatial Continuity and spatial Causal relationships for visual processing. C^2RoPE introduces a spatio-temporal continuous positional embedding mechanism for visual tokens. It first integrates 1D temporal positions with Cartesian-based spatial coordinates to construct a triplet hybrid positional index, and then employs a frequency allocation strategy to encode spatio-temporal positional information across the three index components. Additionally, we introduce Chebyshev Causal Masking, which determines causal dependencies by computing the Chebyshev distance of image tokens in 2D space.

In realistic interactions, appropriate responses often depend on implicit constraints such as user state, goals, or values that are not explicitly queried later. To evaluate this setting, we introduce \\textbf{LoCoMo-Plus}, a benchmark for assessing cognitive memory under cue--trigger semantic disconnect, where models must retain and apply latent constraints across long conversational contexts. We further show that conventional string-matching metrics and explicit task-type prompting are misaligned with such scenarios, and propose a unified evaluation framework based on constraint consistency. Experiments across diverse backbone models, retrieval-based methods, and memory systems demonstrate that cognitive memory remains challenging and reveals failures not captured by existing benchmarks.

In these resource-constrained on-device settings, selecting an appropriate large language model (LLM) backbone is a critical challenge: models must balance accuracy with strict inference latency and hardware efficiency constraints. This makes hardware-software co-design a game-changing requirement for on-device LLM deployment, where each hardware platform demands a tailored architectural solution. We propose a hardware co-design law that jointly captures model accuracy and inference performance. Specifically, we model training loss as an explicit function of architectural hyperparameters and characterise inference latency via roofline modelling. We empirically evaluate 1,942 candidate architectures on NVIDIA Jetson Orin, training 170 selected models for 10B tokens each to fit a scaling law relating architecture to training loss. By coupling this scaling law with latency modelling, we establish a direct accuracy-latency correspondence and identify the Pareto frontier for hardware co-designed LLMs. We further formulate architecture search as a joint optimisation over precision and performance, deriving feasible design regions under industrial hardware and application budgets. Our approach reduces architecture selection from months to days. At the same latency as Qwen2.5-0.5B on the target hardware, our co-designed architecture achieves 19.42% lower perplexity on WikiText-2. To our knowledge, this is the first principled and operational framework for hardware co-design scaling laws in on-device LLM deployment.

While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at basic Visual Question Answering (VQA), they consistently struggle to grasp the nuanced cultural, emotional, and contextual implications embedded in visual content. This difficulty stems from the task's demand for sophisticated multi-hop reasoning, cultural context, and Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities, which current models lack. To fill this gap, we propose MetaphorStar, the first end-to-end visual reinforcement learning (RL) framework for image implication tasks. Our framework includes three core components: the fine-grained dataset TFQ-Data, the visual RL method TFQ-GRPO, and the well-structured benchmark TFQ-Bench.\n  Our fully open-source MetaphorStar family, trained using TFQ-GRPO on TFQ-Data, significantly improves performance by an average of 82.6% on the image implication benchmarks. Compared with 20+ mainstream MLLMs, MetaphorStar-32B achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) on Multiple-Choice Question and Open-Style Question, significantly outperforms the top closed-source model Gemini-3.0-pro on True-False Question.

This study provides the first comprehensive assessment of machine learning and deep learning methodologies for identifying malnutrition among children under five years of age in Nepal. We systematically compared 16 algorithms spanning deep learning, gradient boosting, and traditional machine learning families, using data from the Nepal Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2019. A composite malnutrition indicator was constructed by integrating stunting, wasting, and underweight status, and model performance was evaluated using ten metrics, with emphasis on F1-score and recall to account for substantial class imbalance and the high cost of failing to detect malnourished children. Among all models, TabNet demonstrated the best performance, likely attributable to its attention-based architecture, and outperformed both support vector machine and AdaBoost classifiers. A consensus feature importance analysis identified maternal education, household wealth index, and child age as the primary predictors of malnutrition, followed by geographic characteristics, vaccination status, and meal frequency. Collectively, these results demonstrate a scalable, survey-based screening framework for identifying children at elevated risk of malnutrition and for guiding targeted nutritional interventions.

Existing UIE methods treat images with a single global model and ignore the inconsistent degradation of different scene components. This oversight leads to significant color distortions and loss of fine details in heterogeneous underwater scenes, especially where degradation varies significantly across different image regions. Therefore, we propose SUCode (Semantic-aware Underwater Codebook Network), which achieves adaptive UIE from semantic-aware discrete codebook representation. Compared with one-shot codebook-based methods, SUCode exploits semantic-aware, pixel-level codebook representation tailored to heterogeneous underwater degradation. A three-stage training paradigm is employed to represent raw underwater image features to avoid pseudo ground-truth contamination.

Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) can enhance performance within a target domain, but it typically causes catastrophic forgetting, limiting its generalization. The central challenge, therefore, is to adapt VLMs to new domains while preserving their general-purpose capabilities. Continual pretraining is effective for expanding knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs), but it is less feasible for VLMs due to prohibitive computational costs and the unavailability of pretraining data for most open-source models. This necessitates efficient post-training adaptation methods. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have shown promise in preserving general abilities, yet they often fail in domain adaptation scenarios where the model initially lacks sufficient domain knowledge, leading to optimization collapse. To bridge this gap, we propose Reinforced Curriculum Pre-Alignment (RCPA), a novel post-training paradigm that introduces a curriculum-aware progressive modulation mechanism. In the early phase, RCPA applies partial output constraints to safely expose the model to new domain concepts. As the model's domain familiarity increases, training gradually transitions to full generation optimization, refining responses and aligning them with domain-specific preferences. This staged adaptation balances domain knowledge acquisition with the preservation of general multimodal capabilities. Extensive experiments across specialized domains and general benchmarks validate the effectiveness of RCPA, establishing a practical pathway toward building high-performing and domain-adaptive VLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRCPA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bfe\u7a0b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u8c03\u5236\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u800c\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "RCPA\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u8bfe\u7a0b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u8c03\u5236\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u5e94\u7528\u90e8\u5206\u8f93\u51fa\u7ea6\u675f\u5b89\u5168\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u9886\u57df\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u6a21\u578b\u719f\u6089\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u8fc7\u6e21\u5230\u5b8c\u5168\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u5316", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u548c\u901a\u7528\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86RCPA\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u83b7\u53d6\u4e0e\u901a\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5e73\u8861", "conclusion": "RCPA\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u5b9e\u7528\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898"}}

This necessitates treating timing as a true \\emph{computable} dimension, allowing models to assign ``relative timestamps'' to candidate events beyond their observed physical times.\n  In this work, we introduce LITT, a novel Timing-Transformer architecture that enables temporary alignment of sequential events on a virtual ``relative timeline'', thereby enabling \\emph{event-timing-focused attention} and personalized interpretations of clinical trajectories.

Building upon the efficient YOLOv11n architecture, we propose a deployment-ready pipeline that improves detection under challenging conditions including occlusion, small object size, low resolution, motion blur, and poor lighting commonly found in existing CCTV infrastructures. Our approach introduces a domain-specific augmentation strategy that synthesizes realistic child placements using spatial perturbations such as partial visibility, truncation, and overlaps, combined with photometric degradations including lighting variation and noise. To improve recall of small and partially occluded instances, we integrate Slicing Aided Hyper Inference (SAHI) at inference time. All components are trained and evaluated on a filtered, child-only subset of the Roboflow Daycare dataset. Compared to the baseline YOLOv11n, our enhanced system achieves a mean Average Precision at 0.5 IoU (mAP@0.5) of 0.967 and a mean Average Precision averaged over IoU thresholds from 0.5 to 0.95 (mAP@0.5:0.95) of 0.783, yielding absolute improvements of 0.7 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively, without architectural changes. Importantly, the entire pipeline maintains compatibility with low-power edge devices and supports real-time performance, making it particularly well suited for low-cost or resource-constrained industrial surveillance deployments.

The core cause of hallucination lies in LLMs' lack of awareness regarding their stored internal knowledge, preventing them from expressing their knowledge state on questions beyond their internal knowledge boundaries, as humans do. However, existing research on knowledge boundary expression primarily focuses on white-box LLMs, leaving methods suitable for black-box LLMs which offer only API access without revealing internal parameters-largely unexplored. Against this backdrop, this paper proposes LSCL (LLM-Supervised Confidence Learning), a deep learning-based method for expressing the knowledge boundaries of black-box LLMs. Based on the knowledge distillation framework, this method designs a deep learning model. Taking the input question, output answer, and token probability from a black-box LLM as inputs, it constructs a mapping between the inputs and the model' internal knowledge state, enabling the quantification and expression of the black-box LLM' knowledge boundaries. Experiments conducted on diverse public datasets and with multiple prominent black-box LLMs demonstrate that LSCL effectively assists black-box LLMs in accurately expressing their knowledge boundaries. It significantly outperforms existing baseline models on metrics such as accuracy and recall rate. Furthermore, considering scenarios where some black-box LLMs do not support access to token probability, an adaptive alternative method is proposed. The performance of this alternative approach is close to that of LSCL and surpasses baseline models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLSCL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8ba9\u9ed1\u76d2\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u8868\u8fbe\u5176\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u5931\u771f\uff08\u5e7b\u89c9\uff09\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u81ea\u8eab\u5b58\u50a8\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u50cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e00\u6837\u8868\u8fbe\u8d85\u51fa\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u767d\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9bAPI\u8bbf\u95ee\uff09\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fb9\u754c\u8868\u8fbe\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578bLSCL\uff0c\u4ee5\u9ed1\u76d2LLM\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u8f93\u51fa\u7b54\u6848\u548ctoken\u6982\u7387\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u8f93\u5165\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ed1\u76d2LLM\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u8868\u8fbe\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e3b\u6d41\u9ed1\u76d2LLM\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLSCL\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e2e\u52a9\u9ed1\u76d2LLM\u51c6\u786e\u8868\u8fbe\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e0d\u652f\u6301token\u6982\u7387\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2LLM\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1LSCL\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "LSCL\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9ed1\u76d2\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fb9\u754c\u8868\u8fbe\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u578b\u5e7b\u89c9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

While LLMs excel at processing unstructured text, graph tasks require reasoning over explicit structure, permutation invariance, and computationally complex relationships, creating a mismatch with the representations of text-based models. Our work investigates how LLMs can be effectively applied to graph problems despite these barriers. We introduce a human-interpretable structural encoding strategy for graph-to-text translation that injects graph structure directly into natural language prompts. Our method involves computing a variant of Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) similarity classes and maps them to human-like color tokens rather than numeric labels. The key insight is that semantically meaningful and human-interpretable cues may be more effectively processed by LLMs than opaque symbolic encoding. Experimental results on multiple algorithmic and predictive graph tasks show the considerable improvements by our method on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

This paper focuses on passenger detection applications at train stations using YOLOX and Edge AI Accelerator hardware. the performance of the AI accelerator will be compared with Jetson Orin Nano. The experimental results show that the Hailo-8 AI hardware accelerator has higher accuracy than Jetson Orin Nano (improvement of over 12%) and has lower latency than Jetson Orin Nano (reduced 20 ms).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86YOLOX\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728Hailo-8 AI\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u548cJetson Orin Nano\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u706b\u8f66\u7ad9\u4e58\u5ba2\u68c0\u6d4b\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aHailo-8\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8eJetson Orin Nano\u3002", "motivation": "\u706b\u8f66\u7ad9\u533a\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u4e58\u5ba2\u8d8a\u8fc7\u9ec4\u7ebf\u7b49\u5b89\u5168\u9690\u60a3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6280\u672f\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8b\u6545\u3002\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u5728\u4ea4\u901a\u9886\u57df\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528YOLOX\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u8fb9\u7f18AI\u786c\u4ef6\u5e73\u53f0\uff08Hailo-8 AI\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u548cJetson Orin Nano\uff09\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e58\u5ba2\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u6027\u80fd\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "Hailo-8 AI\u786c\u4ef6\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u76f8\u6bd4Jetson Orin Nano\u6709\u8d85\u8fc712%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8620\u6beb\u79d2\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "Hailo-8 AI\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u5728\u706b\u8f66\u7ad9\u4e58\u5ba2\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u4ea4\u901a\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u51cf\u5c11\u8f66\u7ad9\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4e8b\u6545\u3002"}}

We provide a formal answer to this question, proving that agents achieving task-agnostic, language-conditioned intents necessarily possess predictive partial-world models informed by affordances.

This limitation is especially pronounced in the medical imaging domain, where effective performance requires both robust visual perception and structured reasoning. In this work, we address this gap by proposing VRFT-Aug, a visual reinforcement fine-tuning framework tailored for the medical domain. VRFT-Aug introduces a series of training strategies designed to augment both perception and reasoning, including prior knowledge injection, perception-driven policy refinement, medically informed reward shaping, and behavioral imitation. Together, these methods aim to stabilize and improve the RFT process.\n  Through extensive experiments across multiple medical datasets, we show that our approaches consistently outperform both standard supervised fine-tuning and RFT baselines. Moreover, we provide empirically grounded insights and practical training heuristics that can be generalized to other medical image tasks.

It has various applications in different areas, such as forensic linguistics and general linguistics studies. Although considerable research has been conducted on NLI regarding two different languages, such as English and German, the literature indicates a significant gap regarding NLI for dialects and subdialects. The gap becomes wider in less-resourced languages such as Kurdish. This research focuses on NLI within the context of a subdialect of Sorani (Central) Kurdish. It aims to investigate the NLI for Hewl\u00eari, a subdialect spoken in Hewl\u00ear (Erbil), the Capital of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. We collected about 24 hours of speech by recording interviews with 40 native or non-native Hewl\u00eari speakers, 17 female and 23 male. We created three Neural Network-based models: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which were evaluated through 66 experiments, covering various time-frames from 1 to 60 seconds, undersampling, oversampling, and cross-validation. The RNN model showed the highest accuracy of 95.92% for 5-second audio segmentation, using an 80:10:10 data splitting scheme.

Papalexakis"], "title": "Tensor Methods: A Unified and Interpretable Approach for Material Design", "comment": null, "summary": "When designing new materials, it is often necessary to tailor the material design (with respect to its design parameters) to have some desired properties (e.g. Young's modulus). As the set of design parameters grow, the search space grows exponentially, making the actual synthesis and evaluation of all material combinations virtually impossible. Even using traditional computational methods such as Finite Element Analysis becomes too computationally heavy to search the design space. Recent methods use machine learning (ML) surrogate models to more efficiently determine optimal material designs; unfortunately, these methods often (i) are notoriously difficult to interpret and (ii) under perform when the training data comes from a non-uniform sampling of the design space. We suggest the use of tensor completion methods as an all-in-one approach for interpretability and predictions. We observe classical tensor methods are able to compete with traditional ML in predictions, with the added benefit of their interpretable tensor factors (which are given completely for free, as a result of the prediction). In our experiments, we are able to rediscover physical phenomena via the tensor factors, indicating that our predictions are aligned with the true underlying physics of the problem. This also means these tensor factors could be used by experimentalists to identify potentially novel patterns, given we are able to rediscover existing ones. We also study the effects of both types of surrogate models when we encounter training data from a non-uniform sampling of the design space. We observe more specialized tensor methods that can give better generalization in these non-uniforms sampling scenarios. We find the best generalization comes from a tensor model, which is able to improve upon the baseline ML methods by up to 5% on aggregate $R^2$, and halve the error in some out of distribution regions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u5f20\u91cf\u8865\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6750\u6599\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u975e\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u6750\u6599\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u6839\u636e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u671f\u671b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u968f\u53c2\u6570\u589e\u52a0\u5448\u6307\u6570\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u6709\u9650\u5143\u5206\u6790\uff09\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u5728\u975e\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5f20\u91cf\u8865\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6750\u6599\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5f20\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u6750\u6599\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u5b50\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u8fd8\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u975e\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u573a\u666f\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7ecf\u5178\u5f20\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u80fd\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u514d\u8d39\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5f20\u91cf\u56e0\u5b50\u3002\u5728\u975e\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u805a\u5408R\u00b2\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe5%\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u533a\u57df\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u51cf\u534a\u3002\u5f20\u91cf\u56e0\u5b50\u80fd\u591f\u91cd\u65b0\u53d1\u73b0\u5df2\u77e5\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f20\u91cf\u8865\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6750\u6599\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u517c\u5177\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u6750\u6599\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5f20\u91cf\u56e0\u5b50\u63ed\u793a\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4eba\u5458\u8bc6\u522b\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u65b0\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u5728\u975e\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Here, we introduce DermFM-Zero, a dermatology vision-language foundation model trained via masked latent modelling and contrastive learning on over 4 million multimodal data points. We evaluated DermFM-Zero across 20 benchmarks spanning zero-shot diagnosis and multimodal retrieval, achieving state-of-the-art performance without task-specific adaptation. We further evaluated its zero-shot capabilities in three multinational reader studies involving over 1,100 clinicians. In primary care settings, AI assistance enabled general practitioners to nearly double their differential diagnostic accuracy across 98 skin conditions. In specialist settings, the model significantly outperformed board-certified dermatologists in multimodal skin cancer assessment. In collaborative workflows, AI assistance enabled non-experts to surpass unassisted experts while improving management appropriateness. Finally, we show that DermFM-Zero's latent representations are interpretable: sparse autoencoders unsupervisedly disentangle clinically meaningful concepts that outperform predefined-vocabulary approaches and enable targeted suppression of artifact-induced biases, enhancing robustness without retraining.

However, existing methods often suffer from noisy and conflicting update signals. In this research, we propose C-MOP (Cluster-based Momentum Optimized Prompting), a framework that stabilizes optimization via Boundary-Aware Contrastive Sampling (BACS) and Momentum-Guided Semantic Clustering (MGSC). Specifically, BACS utilizes batch-level information to mine tripartite features--Hard Negatives, Anchors, and Boundary Pairs--to precisely characterize the typical representation and decision boundaries of positive and negative prompt samples. To resolve semantic conflicts, MGSC introduces a textual momentum mechanism with temporal decay that distills persistent consensus from fluctuating gradients across iterations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that C-MOP consistently outperforms SOTA baselines like PromptWizard and ProTeGi, yielding average gains of 1.58% and 3.35%. Notably, C-MOP enables a general LLM with 3B activated parameters to surpass a 70B domain-specific dense LLM, highlighting its effectiveness in driving precise prompt evolution.

To accelerate inference, recent works like GenDR adopt step distillation to minimize the step number to one. However, the memory boundary still restricts the maximum processing size, necessitating tile-by-tile restoration of high-resolution images. Through profiling the pipeline, we pinpoint that the variational auto-encoder (VAE) is the bottleneck of latency and memory. To completely solve the problem, we leverage pixel-(un)shuffle operations to eliminate the VAE, reversing the latent-based GenDR to pixel-space GenDR-Pix. However, upscale with x8 pixelshuffle may induce artifacts of repeated patterns. To alleviate the distortion, we propose a multi-stage adversarial distillation to progressively remove the encoder and decoder. Specifically, we utilize generative features from the previous stage models to guide adversarial discrimination. Moreover, we propose random padding to augment generative features and avoid discriminator collapse. We also introduce a masked Fourier space loss to penalize the outliers of amplitude. To improve inference performance, we empirically integrate a padding-based self-ensemble with classifier-free guidance to improve inference scaling.

Despite rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), it remains unclear whether they can meet the structural requirements of this process, which hinge on preserving roles, methods, and effect-size attribution across documents rather than on recognizing isolated entities. We propose a structural, diagnostic framework that evaluates LLM-based evidence extraction as a progression of schema-constrained queries with increasing relational and numerical complexity, enabling precise identification of failure points beyond atom-level extraction. Using a manually curated corpus spanning five scientific domains, together with a unified query suite and evaluation protocol, we evaluate two state-of-the-art LLMs under both per-document and long-context, multi-document input regimes. Across domains and models, performance remains moderate for single-property queries but degrades sharply once tasks require stable binding between variables, roles, statistical methods, and effect sizes. Full meta-analytic association tuples are extracted with near-zero reliability, and long-context inputs further exacerbate these failures. Downstream aggregation amplifies even minor upstream errors, rendering corpus-level statistics unreliable. Our analysis shows that these limitations stem not from entity recognition errors, but from systematic structural breakdowns, including role reversals, cross-analysis binding drift, instance compression in dense result sections, and numeric misattribution, indicating that current LLMs lack the structural fidelity, relational binding, and numerical grounding required for automated meta-analysis.

Effective specialisation requires learning new reaction knowledge while preserving general chemical understanding across related tasks. Here, we evaluate Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) as a parameter-efficient alternative to full fine-tuning for organic reaction prediction on limited, complex datasets. Using USPTO reaction classes and challenging C-H functionalisation reactions, we benchmark forward reaction prediction, retrosynthesis and reagent prediction. LoRA achieves accuracy comparable to full fine-tuning while effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting and better preserving multi-task performance. Both fine-tuning approaches generalise beyond training distributions, producing plausible alternative solvent predictions.

We revisit this assumption for pre-norm Transformers and ask to what extent sample-dependent normalization is needed inside Transformer blocks. We introduce TaperNorm, a drop-in replacement for RMSNorm/LayerNorm that behaves exactly like the standard normalizer early in training and then smoothly tapers to a learned sample-independent linear/affine map. A single global gate is held at $g{=}1$ during gate warmup, used to calibrate the scaling branch via EMAs, and then cosine-decayed to $g{=}0$, at which point per-token statistics vanish and the resulting fixed scalings can be folded into adjacent linear projections. Our theoretical and empirical results isolate scale anchoring as the key role played by output normalization: as a (near) $0$-homogeneous map it removes radial gradients at the output, whereas without such an anchor cross-entropy encourages unbounded logit growth (``logit chasing''). We further show that a simple fixed-target auxiliary loss on the pre-logit residual-stream scale provides an explicit alternative anchor and can aid removal of the final normalization layer. Empirically, TaperNorm matches normalized baselines under identical setups while eliminating per-token statistics and enabling these layers to be folded into adjacent linear projections at inference. On an efficiency microbenchmark, folding internal scalings yields up to $1.22\\times$ higher throughput in last-token logits mode.

Existing methods primarily rely on a direct text-to-HOI mapping, which suffers from three key limitations due to the significant cross-modality gap: (Q1) sub-optimal human motion, (Q2) unnatural object motion, and (Q3) weak interaction between humans and objects. To address these challenges, we propose MP-HOI, a novel framework grounded in four core insights: (1) Multimodal Data Priors: We leverage multimodal data (text, image, pose/object) from large multimodal models as priors to guide HOI generation, which tackles Q1 and Q2 in data modeling. (2) Enhanced Object Representation: We improve existing object representations by incorporating geometric keypoints, contact features, and dynamic properties, enabling expressive object representations, which tackles Q2 in data representation.

We theoretically show that the proposed method suppresses exponential growth in the search space with respect to query length by leveraging statistical properties of natural language. In experiments on FineWeb-Edu (Lozhkov et al., 2024) (1.4T tokens), we show that our method achieves significantly lower search latency than existing methods: infini-gram (Liu et al., 2024), infini-gram mini (Xu et al., 2025), and SoftMatcha (Deguchi et al., 2025).

However, as context lengths increase, a fundamental limitation of the softmax function emerges: it tends to diffuse probability mass to irrelevant tokens degrading performance in long-sequence scenarios. Furthermore, attempts to sharpen focus by lowering softmax temperature hinder learnability due to vanishing gradients. We introduce LUCID Attention, an architectural modification that applies a preconditioner to the attention probabilities. This preconditioner, derived from exponentiated key-key similarities, minimizes overlap between the keys in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, thus allowing the query to focus on important keys among large number of keys accurately with same computational complexity as standard attention. Additionally, LUCID's preconditioning-based approach to retrieval bypasses the need for low temperature and the learnability problems associated with it. We validate our approach by training ~1 billion parameter language models evaluated on up to 128K tokens. Our results demonstrate significant gains on long-context retrieval tasks, specifically retrieval tasks from BABILong, RULER, SCROLLS and LongBench.

However, developing reliable AI systems for autonomous vehicles remains a substantial challenge. Over the past decade, multi-task learning has emerged as a powerful approach to address complex problems in driving perception. Multi-task networks offer several advantages, including increased computational efficiency, real-time processing capabilities, optimized resource utilization, and improved generalization. In this study, we present AurigaNet, an advanced multi-task network architecture designed to push the boundaries of autonomous driving perception. AurigaNet integrates three critical tasks: object detection, lane detection, and drivable area instance segmentation. The system is trained and evaluated using the BDD100K dataset, renowned for its diversity in driving conditions. Key innovations of AurigaNet include its end-to-end instance segmentation capability, which significantly enhances both accuracy and efficiency in path estimation for autonomous vehicles. Experimental results demonstrate that AurigaNet achieves an 85.2% IoU in drivable area segmentation, outperforming its closest competitor by 0.7%. In lane detection, AurigaNet achieves a remarkable 60.8% IoU, surpassing other models by more than 30%. Furthermore, the network achieves an mAP@0.5:0.95 of 47.6% in traffic object detection, exceeding the next leading model by 2.9%.

However, limitations regarding research on this issue include: 1) the dominance of deficit-based medical models of autism, 2) sample size in qualitative research, and 3) the lack of phenomenological anchoring in computational research. To bridge the gap between phenomenological and computational approaches and overcome sample-size limitations, our research integrated three methodologies. Study A: structured phenomenological interviews with autistic individuals using the Transdiagnostic Assessment of Temporal Experience. Study B: computational analysis of an autobiographical corpus of autistic narratives built for this purpose. Study C: a replication of a computational study using narrative flow measures to assess the perceived phenomenological authenticity of autistic autobiographies. Interviews revealed that the most significant differences between the autistic and control groups concerned unpredictability of experience. Computational results mirrored these findings: the temporal lexicon in autistic narratives was significantly more negatively valenced - particularly the \"Immediacy & Suddenness\" category. Outlier analysis identified terms associated with perceived discontinuity (unpredictably, precipitously, and abruptly) as highly negative. The computational analysis of narrative flow found that the autistic narratives contained within the corpus quantifiably resemble autobiographical stories more than imaginary ones. Overall, the temporal challenges experienced by autistic individuals were shown to primarily concern lived unpredictability and stem from the contents of lived experience, and not from autistic narrative construction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6574\u5408\u73b0\u8c61\u5b66\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4f53\u9a8c\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u4e8e\u751f\u6d3b\u4f53\u9a8c\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u53d9\u4e8b\u5efa\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u65f6\u95f4\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u5927\u5c40\u9650\uff1a1) \u4ee5\u7f3a\u9677\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff1b2) \u8d28\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u5c0f\uff1b3) \u8ba1\u7b97\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u73b0\u8c61\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u9700\u8981\u6574\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4f53\u9a8c\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u65b9\u6cd5\u6574\u5408\uff1a\u7814\u7a76A - \u4f7f\u7528\u8de8\u8bca\u65ad\u65f6\u95f4\u4f53\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u5bf9\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u4e2a\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\u5b66\u8bbf\u8c08\uff1b\u7814\u7a76B - \u5bf9\u4e13\u95e8\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u81ea\u4f20\u53d9\u4e8b\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u7814\u7a76C - \u4f7f\u7528\u53d9\u4e8b\u6d41\u6d4b\u91cf\u590d\u5236\u8ba1\u7b97\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u81ea\u4f20\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u5b66\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "result": "\u8bbf\u8c08\u663e\u793a\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u4e0e\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u6700\u5927\u5dee\u5f02\u5728\u4e8e\u4f53\u9a8c\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u3002\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u5b9e\uff1a\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u53d9\u4e8b\u4e2d\u65f6\u95f4\u8bcd\u6c47\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u8d1f\u9762\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\"\u5373\u65f6\u6027\u4e0e\u7a81\u53d1\u6027\"\u7c7b\u522b\uff09\uff0c\u5f02\u5e38\u8bcd\u5206\u6790\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u8bcd\u6c47\u3002\u53d9\u4e8b\u6d41\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u53d9\u4e8b\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u771f\u5b9e\u81ea\u4f20\u800c\u975e\u865a\u6784\u6545\u4e8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u4e2a\u4f53\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6027\u6311\u6218\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u751f\u6d3b\u4f53\u9a8c\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u53d9\u4e8b\u5efa\u6784\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u6574\u5408\u73b0\u8c61\u5b66\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u65f6\u95f4\u4f53\u9a8c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

However, modifying the original text prompt to achieve the expected semantic adjustments often results in unintended global structure changes that disrupt user intent. Existing methods rely on empirical feature map selection for intervention, whose performance heavily depends on appropriate selection, leading to suboptimal stability. This paper tries to solve the aforementioned problem from a frequency perspective and analyzes the impact of the frequency spectrum of noisy latent variables on the hierarchical emergence of the structure framework and fine-grained textures during the generation process. We find that lower-frequency components are primarily responsible for establishing the structure framework in the early generation stage. Their influence diminishes over time, giving way to higher-frequency components that synthesize fine-grained textures. In light of this, we propose a training-free frequency modulation method utilizing a frequency-dependent weighting function with dynamic decay. This method maintains the structure framework consistency while permitting targeted semantic modifications. By directly manipulating the noisy latent variable, the proposed method avoids the empirical selection of internal feature maps.

We developed AMAP-APP, a cross-platform desktop application designed to overcome these barriers.\n  Methods: AMAP-APP optimizes efficiency by replacing intensive instance segmentation with classic image processing while retaining the original semantic segmentation model. It introduces a refined Region of Interest (ROI) algorithm to improve precision. Validation involved 365 mouse and human images (STED and confocal), benchmarking performance against the original AMAP via Pearson correlation and Two One-Sided T-tests (TOST).\n  Results: AMAP-APP achieved a 147-fold increase in processing speed on consumer hardware.

Nonetheless, it faces persistent challenges, including the pre-selection of an optimal rank and rank-specific hyper-parameters, as well as the deployment complexity of heterogeneous-rank modules and more sophisticated LoRA derivatives. In this work, we introduce LoRA-Squeeze, a simple and efficient methodology that aims to improve standard LoRA learning by changing LoRA module ranks either post-hoc or dynamically during training}. Our approach posits that it is better to first learn an expressive, higher-rank solution and then compress it, rather than learning a constrained, low-rank solution directly. The method involves fine-tuning with a deliberately high(er) source rank, reconstructing or efficiently approximating the reconstruction of the full weight update matrix, and then using Randomized Singular Value Decomposition (RSVD) to create a new, compressed LoRA module at a lower target rank. Extensive experiments across 13 text and 10 vision-language tasks show that post-hoc compression often produces lower-rank adapters that outperform those trained directly at the target rank, especially if a small number of fine-tuning steps at the target rank is allowed. Moreover, a gradual, in-tuning rank annealing variant of LoRA-Squeeze consistently achieves the best LoRA size-performance trade-off.", "AI": {"tldr": "LoRA-Squeeze\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u6807\u51c6LoRA\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540e\u5904\u7406\u538b\u7f29\u6216\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574LoRA\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u79e9\uff0c\u5148\u5b66\u4e60\u9ad8\u79e9\u8868\u8fbe\u518d\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u76f4\u63a5\u5b66\u4e60\u4f4e\u79e9\u7ea6\u675f\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6LoRA\u9762\u4e34\u6301\u7eed\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u9700\u8981\u9884\u5148\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u79e9\u548c\u79e9\u7279\u5b9a\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5f02\u6784\u79e9\u6a21\u5757\u90e8\u7f72\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u66f4\u590d\u6742LoRA\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6539\u8fdbLoRA\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528\u6545\u610f\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u9ad8\u6e90\u79e9\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b2. \u91cd\u6784\u6216\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd1\u4f3c\u91cd\u6784\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u77e9\u9635\uff1b3. \u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u5206\u89e3\uff08RSVD\uff09\u521b\u5efa\u65b0\u7684\u538b\u7f29LoRA\u6a21\u5757\u5230\u8f83\u4f4e\u76ee\u6807\u79e9\u3002\u63d0\u4f9b\u540e\u5904\u7406\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u79e9\u9000\u706b\u4e24\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u572813\u4e2a\u6587\u672c\u548c10\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u540e\u5904\u7406\u538b\u7f29\u901a\u5e38\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u6bd4\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u79e9\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5141\u8bb8\u5c11\u91cf\u76ee\u6807\u79e9\u5fae\u8c03\u6b65\u9aa4\u65f6\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u79e9\u9000\u706b\u53d8\u4f53\u59cb\u7ec8\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u7684LoRA\u5927\u5c0f-\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "LoRA-Squeeze\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u6807\u51c6LoRA\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5148\u5b66\u4e60\u9ad8\u79e9\u8868\u8fbe\u518d\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LoRA\u7684\u79e9\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u590d\u6742\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd-\u6548\u7387\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

Existing UQ approaches for MLIPs are often limited by high computational cost or suboptimal performance. Evidential deep learning (EDL) provides a theoretically grounded single-model alternative that determines both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in a single forward pass. However, extending evidential formulations from scalar targets to vector-valued quantities such as atomic forces introduces substantial challenges, particularly in maintaining statistical self-consistency under rotational transformations. To address this, we propose \\textit{Equivariant Evidential Deep Learning for Interatomic Potentials} ($\\text{e}^2$IP), a backbone-agnostic framework that models atomic forces and their uncertainty jointly by representing uncertainty as a full $3\\times3$ symmetric positive definite covariance tensor that transforms equivariantly under rotations. Experiments on diverse molecular benchmarks show that $\\text{e}^2$IP provides a stronger accuracy-efficiency-reliability balance than the non-equivariant evidential baseline and the widely used ensemble method.

However, existing VCoT approaches are largely confined to static scenarios and struggle to capture the temporal dynamics essential for tasks such as instruction, prediction, and camera motion. To bridge this gap, we propose TwiFF-2.7M, the first large-scale, temporally grounded VCoT dataset derived from $2.7$ million video clips, explicitly designed for dynamic visual question and answer. Accompanying this, we introduce TwiFF-Bench, a high-quality evaluation benchmark of $1,078$ samples that assesses both the plausibility of reasoning trajectories and the correctness of final answers in open-ended dynamic settings. Building on these foundations, we propose the TwiFF model, a unified modal that synergistically leverages pre-trained video generation and image comprehension capabilities to produce temporally coherent visual reasoning cues-iteratively generating future action frames and textual reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TwiFF significantly outperforms existing VCoT methods and Textual Chain-of-Thought baselines on dynamic reasoning tasks, which fully validates the effectiveness for visual question answering in dynamic scenarios.

Identifying linguistically interpretable markers of dementia can support transparent and clinically grounded screening approaches.\n  Methods: This study analyzes spontaneous speech transcripts from the DementiaBank Pitt Corpus using three linguistic representations: raw cleaned text, a part-of-speech (POS)-enhanced representation combining lexical and grammatical information, and a POS-only syntactic representation. Logistic regression and random forest models were evaluated under two protocols: transcript-level train-test splits and subject-level five-fold cross-validation to prevent speaker overlap. Model interpretability was examined using global feature importance, and statistical validation was conducted using Mann-Whitney U tests with Cliff's delta effect sizes.\n  Results: Across representations, models achieved stable performance, with syntactic and grammatical features retaining strong discriminative power even in the absence of lexical content. Subject-level evaluation yielded more conservative but consistent results, particularly for POS-enhanced and POS-only representations. Statistical analysis revealed significant group differences in functional word usage, lexical diversity, sentence structure, and discourse coherence, aligning closely with machine learning feature importance findings.\n  Conclusion: The results demonstrate that abstract linguistic features capture robust markers of early cognitive decline under clinically realistic evaluation.

In this work, we investigate the transfer of this paradigm to binary manifolds, a fundamental setting for generative modeling of discrete data. While $x$-prediction remains effective, we identify a latent structural mismatch that arises when it is coupled with velocity-based objectives ($v$-loss), leading to a time-dependent singular weighting that amplifies gradient sensitivity to approximation errors. Motivated by this observation, we formalize prediction-loss alignment as a necessary condition for flow matching training. We prove that re-aligning the objective to the signal space ($x$-loss) eliminates the singular weighting, yielding uniformly bounded gradients and enabling robust training under uniform timestep sampling without reliance on heuristic schedules. Finally, with alignment secured, we examine design choices specific to binary data, revealing a topology-dependent distinction between probabilistic objectives (e.g., cross-entropy) and geometric losses (e.g., mean squared error). Together, these results provide theoretical foundations and practical guidelines for robust flow matching on binary -- and related discrete -- domains, positioning signal-space alignment as a key principle for robust diffusion learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4fe1\u53f7\u7a7a\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\uff08x-\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u4e0e\u901f\u5ea6\u76ee\u6807\uff08v-\u635f\u5931\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9884\u6d4b-\u635f\u5931\u5bf9\u9f50\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u91cd\u65b0\u5bf9\u9f50\u5230\u4fe1\u53f7\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08x-\u635f\u5931\uff09\u80fd\u6d88\u9664\u5947\u5f02\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4fe1\u53f7\u7a7a\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e00\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u79bb\u6563\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002\u867d\u7136x-\u9884\u6d4b\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u5b83\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\uff0c\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5947\u5f02\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u653e\u5927\u4e86\u68af\u5ea6\u5bf9\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "method": "1. \u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9884\u6d4b-\u635f\u5931\u5bf9\u9f50\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b2. \u8bc1\u660e\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u91cd\u65b0\u5bf9\u9f50\u5230\u4fe1\u53f7\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08x-\u635f\u5931\uff09\u80fd\u6d88\u9664\u5947\u5f02\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u5747\u5300\u6709\u754c\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\uff1b3. \u5728\u83b7\u5f97\u5bf9\u9f50\u540e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6570\u636e\u7279\u6709\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6982\u7387\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u5982\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\uff09\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u635f\u5931\uff08\u5982\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\uff09\u5728\u62d3\u6251\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0a\u7684\u533a\u522b\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u4fe1\u53f7\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u6d88\u9664\u5947\u5f02\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5747\u5300\u6709\u754c\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5728\u5747\u5300\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u91c7\u6837\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u9c81\u68d2\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8c03\u5ea6\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6982\u7387\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u635f\u5931\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u4f9d\u8d56\u533a\u522b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u79bb\u6563\u57df\u4e0a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u5c06\u4fe1\u53f7\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6269\u6563\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5173\u952e\u539f\u5219\u3002\u5bf9\u9f50\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u9488\u5bf9\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To bridge this gap, this paper targets to develop a unified framework for omnibus vision-language forgery detection and grounding. In this unified setting, the {interplay} between diverse modalities and the dual requirements of simultaneous detection and localization pose a critical ``difficulty bias`` problem: the simpler veracity classification task tends to dominate the gradients, leading to suboptimal performance in fine-grained grounding during multi-task optimization. To address this challenge, we propose \\textbf{OmniVL-Guard}, a balanced reinforcement learning framework for omnibus vision-language forgery detection and grounding. Particularly, OmniVL-Guard comprises two core designs: Self-Evolving CoT Generatio and Adaptive Reward Scaling Policy Optimization (ARSPO). {Self-Evolving CoT Generation} synthesizes high-quality reasoning paths, effectively overcoming the cold-start challenge. Building upon this, {Adaptive Reward Scaling Policy Optimization (ARSPO)} dynamically modulates reward scales and task weights, ensuring a balanced joint optimization.

This theory elucidates the inherent dilemma of existing methods, exposing their inability to reconcile variance reduction and noise imitation. To break this curse, we argue that the solution lies in rigorously identifying the latent high-quality distribution entangled within the noisy behavior policy. Accordingly, we reformulate the objective as an Optimistic Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) problem. Guided by this formulation, we propose Distributionally Robust Policy Optimization (DRPO). We prove that hard filtering is the exact solution to this DRO objective, enabling DRPO to optimally recover high-quality behaviors while strictly discarding divergence-inducing noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DRPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on mixed-quality recommendation benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "DRPO\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u786c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u673a\u5236\u5206\u79bb\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5730\u4f4d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u5386\u53f2\u65e5\u5fd7\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528\u65f6\uff0c\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u534f\u8c03\u65b9\u5dee\u51cf\u5c11\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u4eff\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5185\u5728\u56f0\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316(DRPO)\uff1a1)\u5efa\u7acb\u6392\u65a5\u4f18\u5316\u53d1\u6563\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u8d1f\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u5bfc\u81f4\u6307\u6570\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7206\u70b8\uff1b2)\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u4e50\u89c2\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff1b3)\u8bc1\u660e\u786c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u662f\u8be5DRO\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\uff0c\u80fd\u6700\u4f18\u6062\u590d\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u4e25\u683c\u4e22\u5f03\u5bfc\u81f4\u53d1\u6563\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u8d28\u91cf\u63a8\u8350\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDRPO\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u566a\u58f0\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0cDRPO\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u63a8\u8350\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that integrates depth estimation into VLA models to enrich 3D feature representations. Specifically, we employ a depth estimation baseline called VGGT to extract geometry-aware 3D cues from standard RGB inputs, enabling efficient utilization of existing large-scale 2D datasets while implicitly recovering 3D structural information. To further enhance the reliability of these depth-derived features, we introduce a new module called action assistant, which constrains the learned 3D representations with action priors and ensures their consistency with downstream control tasks. By fusing the enhanced 3D features with conventional 2D visual tokens, our approach significantly improves the generalization ability and robustness of VLA models. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only strengthens perception in geometrically ambiguous scenarios but also leads to superior action prediction accuracy.

Two complementary approaches have emerged to address these issues: token-adaptive layer execution, which reduces floating-point operations (FLOPs) by selectively bypassing layers, and quantization, which lowers memory footprint by reducing weight precision. However, naively integrating these techniques leads to additional accuracy degradation due to reduced redundancy in token-adaptive models. We propose QTALE (Quantization-Robust Token-Adaptive Layer Execution for LLMs), a novel framework that enables seamless integration of token-adaptive execution with quantization while preserving accuracy. Conventional token-adaptive methods reduce redundancy in two ways: (1) by limiting the diversity of training paths explored during fine-tuning, and (2) by lowering the number of parameters actively involved in inference. To overcome these limitations, QTALE introduces two key components: (1) a training strategy that ensures diverse execution paths are actively explored during fine-tuning, and (2) a post-training mechanism that allows flexible adjustment of the execution ratio at inference to reintroduce redundancy when needed. Experimental results show that QTALE enables seamless integration of token-adaptive layer execution with quantization, showing no noticeable accuracy difference, with the gap to quantization-only models kept below 0.5% on CommonsenseQA benchmarks. By combining token-adaptive execution for FLOPs reduction and quantization for memory savings, QTALE provides an effective solution for efficient LLM deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "QTALE\u6846\u67b6\u65e0\u7f1d\u6574\u5408token-adaptive\u5c42\u6267\u884c\u4e0e\u91cf\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97FLOPs\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548LLM\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u73b0\u6709token-adaptive\u6267\u884c\uff08\u51cf\u5c11FLOPs\uff09\u548c\u91cf\u5316\uff08\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\uff09\u6280\u672f\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u7b80\u5355\u7ed3\u5408\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3atoken-adaptive\u6a21\u578b\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5197\u4f59\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "QTALE\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u786e\u4fdd\u5fae\u8c03\u671f\u95f4\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u6837\u6267\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff1b2\uff09\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5236\u5141\u8bb8\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7075\u6d3b\u8c03\u6574\u6267\u884c\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4ee5\u91cd\u65b0\u5f15\u5165\u5197\u4f59\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0token-adaptive\u5c42\u6267\u884c\u4e0e\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aQTALE\u80fd\u65e0\u7f1d\u6574\u5408token-adaptive\u6267\u884c\u4e0e\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u65e0\u660e\u663e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e0e\u4ec5\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u4fdd\u6301\u5728CommonsenseQA\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4f4e\u4e8e0.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "QTALE\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408token-adaptive\u6267\u884c\u51cf\u5c11FLOPs\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548LLM\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6280\u672f\u7b80\u5355\u96c6\u6210\u65f6\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Existing methods predominantly operate within a 2D manifold, neglecting the underlying 3D geometry where view-dependent vertical facades (macro-structure) and scale variations (micro-scale) severely corrupt feature alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose (MGS)$^2$, a geometry-grounded framework. The core of our innovation is the Macro-Geometric Structure Filtering (MGSF) module. Unlike pixel-wise matching sensitive to noise, MGSF leverages dilated geometric gradients to physically filter out high-frequency facade artifacts while enhancing the view-invariant horizontal plane, directly addressing the domain shift. To guarantee robust input for this structural filtering, we explicitly incorporate a Micro-Geometric Scale Adaptation (MGSA) module. MGSA utilizes depth priors to dynamically rectify scale discrepancies via multi-branch feature fusion. Furthermore, a Geometric-Appearance Contrastive Distillation (GACD) loss is designed to strictly discriminate against oblique occlusions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that (MGS)$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance, recording a Recall@1 of 97.5\\% on University-1652 and 97.02\\% on SUES-200. Furthermore, the framework exhibits superior cross-dataset generalization against geometric ambiguity.

Our approach formalizes the intent-to-action pathway with a hierarchical labeling scheme, predicting high-level communicative intents and low-level speech acts to learn their causal and temporal dependencies. To train this system, we develop a high quality corpus that pairs controllable, event-rich dialogue data with human-annotated labels. The GoT framework structures streaming predictions as an evolving graph, enabling a transformer to forecast the next speech act, generate concise justifications for its decisions, and dynamically refine its reasoning.

Traditional metrics like mileage fail to capture mechanical burden, while unsupervised deep learning models detect statistical anomalies, typically transient surface shocks, but often conflate statistical stability with mechanical rest. We identify this as a critical blind spot: high-load steady states, such as hill climbing with heavy payloads, appear statistically normal yet impose significant drivetrain fatigue. To resolve this, we propose a Dual-Stream Architecture that fuses unsupervised learning for surface anomaly detection with macroscopic physics proxies for cumulative load estimation. This approach leverages low-frequency sensor data to generate a multi-dimensional health vector, distinguishing between dynamic hazards and sustained mechanical effort. Validated on a RISC-V embedded platform, the architecture demonstrates low computational overhead, enabling comprehensive, edge-based health monitoring on resource-constrained ECUs without the latency or bandwidth costs of cloud-based monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u6d41\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f66\u8f86\u8fd0\u884c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u52a8\u6001\u5f02\u5e38\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u673a\u68b0\u8d1f\u8377\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u91cc\u7a0b\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u673a\u68b0\u8d1f\u8377\uff0c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u7edf\u8ba1\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u5c06\u7edf\u8ba1\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u673a\u68b0\u4f11\u606f\u6df7\u6dc6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u8d1f\u8377\u7a33\u6001\uff08\u5982\u91cd\u8f7d\u722c\u5761\uff09\u5bf9\u4f20\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u75b2\u52b3\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u6d41\u67b6\u6784\uff1a1\uff09\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6d41\u7528\u4e8e\u8868\u9762\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff1b2\uff09\u5b8f\u89c2\u7269\u7406\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u7d2f\u79ef\u8d1f\u8377\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u9891\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u591a\u7ef4\u5065\u5eb7\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u52a8\u6001\u5371\u9669\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u673a\u68b0\u8d1f\u8377\u3002", "result": "\u5728RISC-V\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u67b6\u6784\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u4f4e\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684ECU\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u5065\u5eb7\u76d1\u6d4b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4e91\u7aef\u76d1\u63a7\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u5e26\u5bbd\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u53cc\u6d41\u67b6\u6784\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u76f2\u70b9\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u77ac\u6001\u5f02\u5e38\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u6301\u7eed\u673a\u68b0\u8d1f\u8377\uff0c\u4e3a\u5546\u7528\u548c\u91cd\u578b\u8f66\u961f\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u7ef4\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

However, it remains challenging due to cluttered backgrounds, severe scale variation, and large orientation changes. Existing approaches largely improve performance through multi-scale feature fusion with feature pyramid networks or contextual modeling with attention, but they often lack explicit foreground modeling and do not leverage geometric orientation priors, which limits feature discriminability. To overcome these limitations, we propose FGAA-FPN, a Foreground-Guided Angle-Aware Feature Pyramid Network for oriented object detection. FGAA-FPN is built on a hierarchical functional decomposition that accounts for the distinct spatial resolution and semantic abstraction across pyramid levels, thereby strengthening multi-scale representations. Concretely, a Foreground-Guided Feature Modulation module learns foreground saliency under weak supervision to enhance object regions and suppress background interference in low-level features. In parallel, an Angle-Aware Multi-Head Attention module encodes relative orientation relationships to guide global interactions among high-level semantic features.

Traditional approaches rely on supervised training with word-level aligned data, which is difficult to collect at scale and thus depends on synthetic alignments using language-specific heuristics that are suboptimal. We propose Hibiki-Zero, which eliminates the need for word-level alignments entirely. This fundamentally simplifies the training pipeline and enables seamless scaling to diverse languages with varying grammatical structures, removing the bottleneck of designing language-specific alignment heuristics. We first train on sentence-level aligned data to learn speech translation at high latency, then apply a novel reinforcement learning strategy using GRPO to optimize latency while preserving translation quality. Hibiki-Zero achieves state-of-the-art performance in translation accuracy, latency, voice transfer, and naturalness across five X-to-English tasks.

We introduce Control Reinforcement Learning (CRL), which trains a policy to select SAE features for steering at each token, producing interpretable intervention logs: the learned policy identifies features that change model outputs when amplified. Adaptive Feature Masking encourages diverse feature discovery while preserving singlefeature interpretability. The framework yields new analysis capabilities: branch point tracking locates tokens where feature choice determines output correctness; critic trajectory analysis separates policy limitations from value estimation errors; layer-wise comparison reveals syntactic features in early layers and semantic features in later layers. On Gemma-2 2B across MMLU, BBQ, GSM8K, HarmBench, and XSTest, CRL achieves improvements while providing per-token intervention logs.

However, the utility of GFMs has not been fully explored for high-value use cases. This study aims to explore the utility, challenges and opportunities associated with the application of GFMs for ecological uses. In this regard, we fine-tune several pretrained AI models, namely, Prithvi-E0-2.0 and TerraMind, across three use cases, and compare this with a baseline ResNet-101 model. Firstly, we demonstrate TerraMind's LULC generation capabilities. Lastly, we explore the utility of the GFMs in forest functional trait mapping and peatlands detection. In all experiments, the GFMs outperform the baseline ResNet models. In general TerraMind marginally outperforms Prithvi. However, with additional modalities TerraMind significantly outperforms the baseline ResNet and Prithvi models. Nonetheless, consideration should be given to the divergence of input data from pretrained modalities.

Tax law exemplifies these challenges, as correct answers require exact statutory citation, structured legal argumentation, and numerical accuracy under rigid grading schemes. We algorithmically generate SteuerEx, the first open benchmark derived from authentic German university tax law examinations. SteuerEx comprises 115 expert-validated examination questions spanning six core tax law domains and multiple academic levels, and employs a statement-level, partial-credit evaluation framework that closely mirrors real examination practice. We further present SteuerLLM, a domain-adapted LLM for German tax law trained on a large-scale synthetic dataset generated from authentic examination material using a controlled retrieval-augmented pipeline. SteuerLLM (28B parameters) consistently outperforms general-purpose instruction-tuned models of comparable size and, in several cases, substantially larger systems, demonstrating that domain-specific data and architectural adaptation are more decisive than parameter scale for performance on realistic legal reasoning tasks. All benchmark data, training datasets, model weights, and evaluation code are released openly to support reproducible research in domain-specific legal artificial intelligence.

Despite their growing importance, standardized benchmarks for evaluating machine learning performance in data lake environments remain scarce. To address this gap, we present LakeMLB (Data Lake Machine Learning Benchmark), designed for the most common multi-source, multi-table scenarios in data lakes. LakeMLB focuses on two representative multi-table scenarios, Union and Join, and provides three real-world datasets for each scenario, covering government open data, finance, Wikipedia, and online marketplaces.

The lack of data typically results in artifacts in the reconstructed image and may even lead to object distortions. For this reason, the use of deep generative models in this context has great interest and potential success. In the Deep Generative Prior (DGP) framework, the use of diffusion-based generative models is combined with an iterative optimization algorithm for the reconstruction of CT images from sinograms acquired under sparse geometries, to maintain the explainability of a model-based approach while introducing the generative power of a neural network. There are therefore several aspects that can be further investigated within these frameworks to improve reconstruction quality, such as image generation, the model, and the iterative algorithm used to solve the minimization problem, for which we propose modifications with respect to existing approaches. The results obtained even under highly sparse geometries are very promising, although further research is clearly needed in this direction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u51e0\u4f55CT\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf", "motivation": "\u7a00\u758f\u6216\u6709\u9650\u89d2\u5ea6CT\u91cd\u5efa\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\u548c\u7269\u4f53\u53d8\u5f62\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u7b97\u6cd5", "result": "\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7a00\u758f\u51e0\u4f55\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u91cd\u5efa\u7ed3\u679c\u4e5f\u5f88\u6709\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u65b9\u5411\u4ecd\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76", "conclusion": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u7a00\u758fCT\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u503c\u5f97\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22"}}

Despite the growing use of LLMs to automate individual data processing steps, such as data synthesis and filtering, the overall design of data recipes remains largely manual and labor-intensive, requiring substantial human expertise and iteration. To bridge this gap, we formulate \\emph{end-to-end data recipe generation} for LLM adaptation. Given a target benchmark and a pool of available data sources, a model is required to output a complete data recipe that adapts a base LLM to the target task. We present DataChef-32B, which performs online reinforcement learning using a proxy reward that predicts downstream performance for candidate recipes. Across six held-out tasks, DataChef-32B produces practical recipes that reach comparable downstream performance to those curated by human experts. Notably, the recipe from DataChef-32B adapts Qwen3-1.7B-Base to the math domain, achieving 66.7 on AIME'25 and surpassing Qwen3-1.7B.

OccFace adopts a unified dense 100-point layout and a heatmap-based backbone, and adds an occlusion module that jointly predicts landmark coordinates and per-point visibility by combining local evidence with cross-landmark context. Visibility supervision mixes manual labels with landmark-aware masking that derives pseudo visibility from mask-heatmap overlap.

In modern overparameterized models, forming or inverting $F\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d\\times d}$ is prohibitive, motivating scalable influence computation via random projection with a sketch $P \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times d}$. This practice is commonly justified via the Johnson--Lindenstrauss (JL) lemma, which ensures approximate preservation of Euclidean geometry for a fixed dataset. However, JL does not address how sketching behaves under inversion. Furthermore, there is no existing theory that explains how sketching interacts with other widely-used techniques, such as ridge regularization and structured curvature approximations.\n  We develop a unified theory characterizing when projection provably preserves influence functions. When $g,g^{\\prime}\\in\\text{range}(F)$, we show that: 1) Unregularized projection: exact preservation holds iff $P$ is injective on $\\text{range}(F)$, which necessitates $m\\geq \\text{rank}(F)$; 2) Regularized projection: ridge regularization fundamentally alters the sketching barrier, with approximation guarantees governed by the effective dimension of $F$ at the regularization scale; 3) Factorized influence: for Kronecker-factored curvatures $F=A\\otimes E$, the guarantees continue to hold for decoupled sketches $P=P_A\\otimes P_E$, even though such sketches exhibit row correlations that violate i.i.d. assumptions. Beyond this range-restricted setting, we analyze out-of-range test gradients and quantify a \\emph{leakage} term that arises when test gradients have components in $\\ker(F)$. This yields guarantees for influence queries on general test points.\n  Overall, this work develops a novel theory that characterizes when projection provably preserves influence and provides principled guidance for choosing the sketch size in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u968f\u673a\u6295\u5f71\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u51fd\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u6295\u5f71\u4e0e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u66f2\u7387\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f71\u54cd\u51fd\u6570\u9700\u8981\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7ef4\u66f2\u7387\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u6c42\u9006\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0a\u975e\u5e38\u6602\u8d35\u3002\u867d\u7136\u968f\u673a\u6295\u5f71\u6280\u672f\u5e38\u88ab\u7528\u4e8e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\uff08\u5982Johnson-Lindenstrauss\u5f15\u7406\uff09\u53ea\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4fdd\u6301\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u5206\u6790\u6295\u5f71\u5728\u77e9\u9635\u6c42\u9006\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u89e3\u91ca\u6295\u5f71\u5982\u4f55\u4e0e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u66f2\u7387\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b49\u5e38\u7528\u6280\u672f\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6295\u5f71\u4f55\u65f6\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5f71\u54cd\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4fdd\u6301\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1\uff09\u5206\u6790\u65e0\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6295\u5f71\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u4fdd\u6301\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b2\uff09\u7814\u7a76\u5cad\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u53d8\u6295\u5f71\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1b3\uff09\u5206\u6790Kronecker\u5206\u89e3\u66f2\u7387\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u6295\u5f71\uff1b4\uff09\u91cf\u5316\u5f53\u6d4b\u8bd5\u68af\u5ea6\u5728\u6838\u7a7a\u95f4\u65f6\u7684\"\u6cc4\u6f0f\"\u9879\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09\u65e0\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6295\u5f71\u7cbe\u786e\u4fdd\u6301\u5f71\u54cd\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5145\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\u662f\u6295\u5f71\u5728\u66f2\u7387\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u503c\u57df\u4e0a\u662f\u5355\u5c04\uff0c\u8fd9\u8981\u6c42\u6295\u5f71\u7ef4\u5ea6\u81f3\u5c11\u7b49\u4e8e\u66f2\u7387\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u79e9\uff1b2\uff09\u5cad\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u6295\u5f71\u7684\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7531\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7ef4\u5ea6\u51b3\u5b9a\uff1b3\uff09\u5bf9\u4e8eKronecker\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u66f2\u7387\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6295\u5f71\u5177\u6709\u884c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4ecd\u7136\u6210\u7acb\uff1b4\uff09\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e00\u822c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u70b9\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u6838\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u91cf\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u6cc4\u6f0f\u9879\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u8868\u5f81\u4e86\u6295\u5f71\u4f55\u65f6\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5f71\u54cd\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4fdd\u6301\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u9009\u62e9\u6295\u5f71\u7ef4\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u6295\u5f71\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u51fd\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002"}}

Existing benchmarks, such as SAFETUNEBED (safety-centric), VALUEBENCH (value-centric), and WORLDVIEW-BENCH (culture-centric), primarily evaluate these dimensions in isolation and therefore provide limited insight into their interactions and trade-offs. More recent efforts, including MIB and INTERPRETABILITY BENCHMARK-based on mechanistic interpretability, offer valuable perspectives on model failures; however, they remain insufficient for systematically characterizing cross-dimensional trade-offs. To address these gaps, we introduce MisAlign-Profile, a unified benchmark for measuring misalignment trade-offs inspired by mechanistic profiling. First, we construct MISALIGNTRADE, an English misaligned-aligned dataset across 112 normative domains taxonomies, including 14 safety, 56 value, and 42 cultural domains. In addition to domain labels, each prompt is classified with one of three orthogonal semantic types-object, attribute, or relations misalignment-using Gemma-2-9B-it and expanded via Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507 with SimHash-based fingerprinting to avoid deduplication. Each prompt is paired with misaligned and aligned responses through two-stage rejection sampling to ensure quality.

In contrast to SR artifacts arising from synthetic LR images created under well-defined scenarios, those distortions are highly unpredictable and vary significantly across different real-life contexts. Consequently, assessing the quality of SR images (SR-IQA) obtained from realistic LR, remains a challenging and underexplored problem. In this work, we introduce a no-reference SR-IQA approach tailored for such highly ill-posed realistic settings. The proposed method enables domain-adaptive IQA for real-world SR applications, particularly in data-scarce domains. We hypothesize that degradations in super-resolved images are strongly dependent on the underlying SR algorithms, rather than being solely determined by image content. To this end, we introduce a self-supervised learning (SSL) strategy that first pretrains multiple SR model oriented representations in a pretext stage. Our contrastive learning framework forms positive pairs from images produced by the same SR model and negative pairs from those generated by different methods, independent of image content. The proposed approach S3 RIQA, further incorporates targeted preprocessing to extract complementary quality information and an auxiliary task to better handle the various degradation profiles associated with different SR scaling factors. To this end, we constructed a new dataset, SRMORSS, to support unsupervised pretext training; it includes a wide range of SR algorithms applied to numerous real LR images, which addresses a gap in existing datasets. Experiments on real SR-IQA benchmarks demonstrate that S3 RIQA consistently outperforms most state-of-the-art relevant metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faS3 RIQA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3SR\u6a21\u578b\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u73b0\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94IQA\u3002", "motivation": "\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5904\u7406\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u590d\u6742\u3001\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9000\u5316\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u4e14\u968f\u573a\u666f\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u5408\u6210LR\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u771f\u5b9eSR\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30(SR-IQA)\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u4e14\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faS3 RIQA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u540c\u4e00SR\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b63\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\uff0c\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u5185\u5bb9\uff1b2) \u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u9884\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u53d6\u8865\u5145\u8d28\u91cf\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b3) \u8f85\u52a9\u4efb\u52a1\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540cSR\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u9000\u5316\u7279\u5f81\uff1b4) \u6784\u5efa\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6SRMORSS\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9eSR-IQA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cS3 RIQA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cSR\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u9002\u5b9a\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cSR\u8bbe\u7f6e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7SR\u6a21\u578b\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684IQA\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Although large language models (LLMs) have been explored for this task, evaluation is still dominated by toy-sized or synthetic benchmarks, masking the difficulty of industrial problems with $10^{3}$--$10^{6}$ (or more) variables and constraints. A key bottleneck is the lack of benchmarks that align natural-language specifications with reference formulations/solver code grounded in real optimization models. To fill in this gap, we introduce MIPLIB-NL, built via a structure-aware reverse construction methodology from real mixed-integer linear programs in MIPLIB~2017. Our pipeline (i) recovers compact, reusable model structure from flat solver formulations, (ii) reverse-generates natural-language specifications explicitly tied to this recovered structure under a unified model--data separation format, and (iii) performs iterative semantic validation through expert review and human--LLM interaction with independent reconstruction checks. This yields 223 one-to-one reconstructions that preserve the mathematical content of the original instances while enabling realistic natural-language-to-optimization evaluation.

Procedural alternatives introduce stepwise generation but often rely on mechanism-specific supervision, discrete symbolic edits, and computationally expensive inference. In this work, we propose LatentRxnFlow, a new reaction prediction paradigm that models reactions as continuous latent trajectories anchored at the thermodynamic product state. Built on Conditional Flow Matching, our approach learns time-dependent latent dynamics directly from standard reactant-product pairs, without requiring mechanistic annotations or curated intermediate labels. While LatentRxnFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on USPTO benchmarks, more importantly, the continuous formulation exposes the full generative trajectory, enabling trajectory-level diagnostics that are difficult to realize with discrete or one-shot models. We show that latent trajectory analysis allows us to localize and characterize failure modes and to mitigate certain errors via gated inference. Furthermore, geometric properties of the learned trajectories provide an intrinsic signal of epistemic uncertainty, helping prioritize reliably predictable reaction outcomes and flag ambiguous cases for additional validation. Overall, LatentRxnFlow combines strong predictive accuracy with improved transparency, diagnosability, and uncertainty awareness, moving reaction prediction toward more trustworthy deployment in high-throughput discovery workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "LatentRxnFlow\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u5efa\u6a21\u5316\u5b66\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53cd\u5e94\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53cd\u5e94\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u4e3a\u4ece\u53cd\u5e94\u7269\u5230\u4ea7\u7269\u7684\u4e00\u6b65\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u53cd\u5e94\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff1b\u9010\u6b65\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u673a\u5236\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u3001\u79bb\u6563\u7b26\u53f7\u7f16\u8f91\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff08Conditional Flow Matching\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u53cd\u5e94\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u951a\u5b9a\u5728\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u4ea7\u7269\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u6807\u51c6\u53cd\u5e94\u7269-\u4ea7\u7269\u5bf9\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u673a\u5236\u6ce8\u91ca\u6216\u4e2d\u95f4\u4f53\u6807\u7b7e", "result": "\u5728USPTO\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\u8fde\u7eed\u8f68\u8ff9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u95e8\u63a7\u63a8\u7406\u7ea0\u9519\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30", "conclusion": "LatentRxnFlow\u5c06\u5f3a\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u610f\u8bc6\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u53cd\u5e94\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u53d1\u73b0\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u66f4\u53ef\u4fe1\u5730\u90e8\u7f72"}}

In such settings, learning the full conditional distribution of admissible outcomes in a physically consistent and interpretable manner remains a challenge. While recent advances in machine learning have enabled powerful multimodal generative modeling, their integration with physics-constrained scientific modeling remains nontrivial, particularly when physical structure must be preserved or data are limited. This work develops a physics-informed multimodal conditional modeling framework based on mixture density representations. Mixture density networks (MDNs) provide an explicit and interpretable parameterization of multimodal conditional distributions. Physical knowledge is embedded through component-specific regularization terms that penalize violations of governing equations or physical laws. This formulation naturally accommodates non-uniqueness and stochasticity while remaining computationally efficient and amenable to conditioning on contextual inputs. The proposed framework is evaluated across a range of scientific problems in which multimodality arises from intrinsic physical mechanisms rather than observational noise, including bifurcation phenomena in nonlinear dynamical systems, stochastic partial differential equations, and atomistic-scale shock dynamics. In addition, the proposed method is compared with a conditional flow matching (CFM) model, a representative state-of-the-art generative modeling approach, demonstrating that MDNs can achieve competitive performance while offering a simpler and more interpretable formulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df7\u5408\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc(MDN)\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7279\u5b9a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5d4c\u5165\u7269\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u5e03", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591a\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u5185\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u5982\u6f5c\u5728\u673a\u5236\u5207\u6362\u3001\u975e\u552f\u4e00\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff09\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u5b8c\u6574\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u5e03", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df7\u5408\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc(MDN)\u6784\u5efa\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7279\u5b9a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9879\u60e9\u7f5a\u8fdd\u53cd\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\u6216\u7269\u7406\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8f93\u5165", "result": "\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u5c94\u73b0\u8c61\u3001\u968f\u673a\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u3001\u539f\u5b50\u5c3a\u5ea6\u51b2\u51fb\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7b49\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u79d1\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4e0e\u6761\u4ef6\u6d41\u5339\u914d(CFM)\u76f8\u6bd4\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\u4f46\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca", "conclusion": "MDN\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u5185\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u884c\u4e3a"}}

Existing methods attempt to reduce distributional shifts by aligning manually selected graph elements (e.g., node attributes or structural statistics), which typically require manually designed graph filters to extract relevant features before alignment. However, such approaches are inflexible: they rely on scenario-specific heuristics, and struggle when dominant discrepancies vary across transfer scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{ADAlign}, an Adaptive Distribution Alignment framework for GDA. Unlike heuristic methods, ADAlign requires no manual specification of alignment criteria. It automatically identifies the most relevant discrepancies in each transfer and aligns them jointly, capturing the interplay between attributes, structures, and their dependencies. This makes ADAlign flexible, scenario-aware, and robust to diverse and dynamically evolving shifts. To enable this adaptivity, we introduce the Neural Spectral Discrepancy (NSD), a theoretically principled parametric distance that provides a unified view of cross-graph shifts. NSD leverages neural characteristic function in the spectral domain to encode feature-structure dependencies of all orders, while a learnable frequency sampler adaptively emphasizes the most informative spectral components for each task via minimax paradigm. Extensive experiments on 10 datasets and 16 transfer tasks show that ADAlign not only outperforms state-of-the-art baselines but also achieves efficiency gains with lower memory usage and faster training.", "AI": {"tldr": "ADAlign\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u6307\u5b9a\u5bf9\u9f50\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u8054\u5408\u5bf9\u9f50\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8fc1\u79fb\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u572810\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c16\u4e2a\u8fc1\u79fb\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u5b83\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u624b\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u56fe\u5143\u7d20\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u573a\u666f\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u8fc1\u79fb\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5dee\u5f02\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u591f\u7075\u6d3b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u6837\u5316\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u53d8\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faADAlign\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u795e\u7ecf\u8c31\u5dee\u5f02\uff08NSD\uff09\u8fd9\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u6709\u539f\u5219\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002NSD\u5229\u7528\u8c31\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7279\u5f81\u51fd\u6570\u7f16\u7801\u6240\u6709\u9636\u7684\u7279\u5f81-\u7ed3\u6784\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9891\u7387\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u4ee5\u6781\u5c0f\u6781\u5927\u8303\u5f0f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5f3a\u8c03\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6700\u5177\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u7684\u8c31\u6210\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u572810\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c16\u4e2a\u8fc1\u79fb\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cADAlign\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "ADAlign\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u8054\u5408\u5bf9\u9f50\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u573a\u666f\u611f\u77e5\u4e14\u5bf9\u591a\u6837\u5316\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u53d8\u504f\u79fb\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u56fe\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u6307\u5b9a\u5bf9\u9f50\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

Mitchell", "Chao Wang"], "title": "Analyzing Fairness of Neural Network Prediction via Counterfactual Dataset Generation", "comment": "Presented at NLDL 2026", "summary": "Interpreting the inference-time behavior of deep neural networks remains a challenging problem. Existing approaches to counterfactual explanation typically ask: What is the closest alternative input that would alter the model's prediction in a desired way? In contrast, we explore counterfactual datasets. Rather than perturbing the input, our method efficiently finds the closest alternative training dataset, one that differs from the original dataset by changing a few labels. Training a new model on this altered dataset can then lead to a different prediction of a given test instance. This perspective provides a new way to assess fairness by directly analyzing the influence of label bias on training and inference. Our approach can be characterized as probing whether a given prediction depends on biased labels. Since exhaustively enumerating all possible alternate datasets is infeasible, we develop analysis techniques that trace how bias in the training data may propagate through the learning algorithm to the trained network. Our method heuristically ranks and modifies the labels of a bounded number of training examples to construct a counterfactual dataset, retrains the model, and checks whether its prediction on a chosen test case changes.

While consistency models (CMs) represent a state-of-the-art distillation-based approach for efficient generation, their large-scale application is still limited by two key issues: training instability and inflexible sampling. Existing methods seek to mitigate these problems through architectural adjustments or regularized objectives, yet overlook the critical reliance on trajectory selection. In this work, we first conduct an analysis on these two limitations: training instability originates from loss divergence induced by unstable self-supervised term, whereas sampling inflexibility arises from error accumulation. Based on these insights and analysis, we propose the Dual-End Consistency Model (DE-CM) that selects vital sub-trajectory clusters to achieve stable and effective training. DE-CM decomposes the PF-ODE trajectory and selects three critical sub-trajectories as optimization targets. Specifically, our approach leverages continuous-time CMs objectives to achieve few-step distillation and utilizes flow matching as a boundary regularizer to stabilize the training process. Furthermore, we propose a novel noise-to-noisy (N2N) mapping that can map noise to any point, thereby alleviating the error accumulation in the first step. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness of our method: it achieves a state-of-the-art FID score of 1.70 in one-step generation on the ImageNet 256x256 dataset, outperforming existing CM-based one-step approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "DE-CM\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u5173\u952e\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u7c07\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u566a\u58f0\u5230\u566a\u58f0\u6620\u5c04\u7f13\u89e3\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\uff0c\u5728ImageNet 256\u00d7256\u4e0a\u5355\u6b65\u751f\u6210FID\u8fbe\u52301.70\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709CM\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u548c\u6d41\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u91c7\u6837\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u662f\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6a21\u578b(CMs)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ecd\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u4e0d\u7075\u6d3b\u4e24\u5927\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u67b6\u6784\u8c03\u6574\u6216\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u7f13\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u8f68\u8ff9\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u7aef\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6a21\u578b(DE-CM)\uff1a1) \u5206\u6790\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6e90\u4e8e\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9879\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u635f\u5931\u53d1\u6563\uff0c\u91c7\u6837\u4e0d\u7075\u6d3b\u6e90\u4e8e\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\uff1b2) \u9009\u62e9\u5173\u952e\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u7c07\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u6709\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5206\u89e3PF-ODE\u8f68\u8ff9\u5e76\u9009\u62e9\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff1b3) \u5229\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4CM\u76ee\u6807\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c11\u6b65\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fb9\u754c\u6b63\u5219\u5668\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b4) \u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u5230\u566a\u58f0(N2N)\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u53ef\u5c06\u566a\u58f0\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u4efb\u610f\u70b9\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet 256\u00d7256\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cDE-CM\u5728\u5355\u6b65\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e861.70\u7684FID\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eCM\u7684\u5355\u6b65\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "DE-CM\u901a\u8fc7\u8f68\u8ff9\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u548cN2N\u6620\u5c04\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86CMs\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u4e0d\u7075\u6d3b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u6b65\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Our primary finding is that despite operating in high-dimensional parameter spaces ($d=128$), transformer training trajectories rapidly collapse onto low-dimensional execution manifolds of dimension $3$--$4$. This dimensional collapse is robust across random seeds and moderate task difficulties, though the orientation of the manifold in parameter space varies between runs. We demonstrate that this geometric structure underlies several empirically observed phenomena: (1) sharp attention concentration emerges as saturation along routing coordinates within the execution manifold, (2) stochastic gradient descent (SGD) exhibits approximately integrable dynamics when projected onto the execution subspace, with non-integrability confined to orthogonal staging directions, and (3) sparse autoencoders capture auxiliary routing structure but fail to isolate execution itself, which remains distributed across the low-dimensional manifold.

Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on autonomous driving benchmarks, suggesting their potential for general traffic understanding and navigation-related reasoning. However, existing evaluations are predominantly vehicle-centric and fail to assess perception and reasoning from a cyclist-centric viewpoint. To address this gap, we introduce CyclingVQA, a diagnostic benchmark designed to probe perception, spatio-temporal understanding, and traffic-rule-to-lane reasoning from a cyclist's perspective. Evaluating 31+ recent VLMs spanning general-purpose, spatially enhanced, and autonomous-driving-specialized models, we find that current models demonstrate encouraging capabilities, while also revealing clear areas for improvement in cyclist-centric perception and reasoning, particularly in interpreting cyclist-specific traffic cues and associating signs with the correct navigational lanes. Notably, several driving-specialized models underperform strong generalist VLMs, indicating limited transfer from vehicle-centric training to cyclist-assistive scenarios. Finally, through systematic error analysis, we identify recurring failure modes to guide the development of more effective cyclist-assistive intelligent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCyclingVQA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u884c\u8f66\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u884c\u8f66\u4e13\u7528\u4ea4\u901a\u6807\u5fd7\u548c\u8f66\u9053\u5173\u8054\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u8f66\u8f86\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u81ea\u884c\u8f66\u9a91\u884c\u8005\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u800c\u81ea\u884c\u8f66\u5728\u57ce\u5e02\u4ea4\u901a\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u652f\u6301", "method": "\u5f15\u5165CyclingVQA\u8bca\u65ad\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4ece\u81ea\u884c\u8f66\u9a91\u884c\u8005\u89c6\u89d2\u6d4b\u8bd5\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u65f6\u7a7a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u4ea4\u901a\u89c4\u5219\u5230\u8f66\u9053\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f3031+\u4e2a\u6700\u65b0\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b", "result": "\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6709\u5e0c\u671b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u81ea\u884c\u8f66\u4e13\u7528\u4ea4\u901a\u7ebf\u7d22\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u6807\u5fd7\u4e0e\u6b63\u786e\u5bfc\u822a\u8f66\u9053\u5173\u8054\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u4e00\u4e9b\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u5982\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u884c\u8f66\u8f85\u52a9\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u6790\u8bc6\u522b\u5e38\u89c1\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411"}}

One promising recent approach addresses graph transfer by discretizing the adaptation process, typically through the construction of intermediate graphs or stepwise alignment procedures. However, such discrete strategies often fail in real-world scenarios, where graph structures evolve continuously and nonlinearly, making it difficult for fixed-step alignment to approximate the actual transformation process. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{DiffGDA}, a \\textbf{Diff}usion-based \\textbf{GDA} method that models the domain adaptation process as a continuous-time generative process. We formulate the evolution from source to target graphs using stochastic differential equations (SDEs), enabling the joint modeling of structural and semantic transitions. To guide this evolution, a domain-aware network is introduced to steer the generative process toward the target domain, encouraging the diffusion trajectory to follow an optimal adaptation path. We theoretically show that the diffusion process converges to the optimal solution bridging the source and target domains in the latent space.

However, reproducible comparisons has been limited by ethical constraints in human studies and the lack of open benchmark datasets. To address this gap, we introduce a new dataset, the first reproducible benchmark for PD prediction. It is constructed from long-term ECoG recordings of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced rat models and annotated with neural responses measured before and after electrical stimulation. In addition, we propose a Swap-Adversarial Framework (SAF) that mitigates high inter-subject variability and the high-dimensional low-sample-size (HDLSS) problem in ECoG data, while achieving robust domain generalization across ECoG and EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) datasets. The framework integrates (1) robust preprocessing, (2) Inter-Subject Balanced Channel Swap (ISBCS) for cross-subject augmentation, and (3) domain-adversarial training to suppress subject-specific bias. ISBCS randomly swaps channels between subjects to reduce inter-subject variability, and domain-adversarial training jointly encourages the model to learn task-relevant shared features. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method through extensive experiments under cross-subject, cross-session, and cross-dataset settings. Our method consistently outperformed all baselines across all settings, showing the most significant improvements in highly variable environments. Furthermore, the proposed method achieved superior cross-dataset performance between public EEG benchmarks, demonstrating strong generalization capability not only within ECoG but to EEG data.

A Data-Centric Perspective on VLM Post-Training", "comment": null, "summary": "The adaptation of large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) through post-training reveals a pronounced generalization gap: models fine-tuned with Reinforcement Learning (RL) consistently achieve superior out-of-distribution (OOD) performance compared to those trained with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). This paper posits a data-centric explanation for this phenomenon, contending that RL's generalization advantage arises from an implicit data filtering mechanism that inherently prioritizes medium-difficulty training samples. To test this hypothesis, we systematically evaluate the OOD generalization of SFT models across training datasets of varying difficulty levels. Our results confirm that data difficulty is a critical factor, revealing that training on hard samples significantly degrades OOD performance. Motivated by this finding, we introduce Difficulty-Curated SFT (DC-SFT), a straightforward method that explicitly filters the training set based on sample difficulty. Experiments show that DC-SFT not only substantially enhances OOD generalization over standard SFT, but also surpasses the performance of RL-based training, all while providing greater stability and computational efficiency. This work offers a data-centric account of the OOD generalization gap in VLMs and establishes a more efficient pathway to achieving robust generalization.

To improve efficiency, recent work has explored model upscaling: initializing larger models from trained smaller ones in order to transfer knowledge and accelerate convergence. However, this method can be sensitive to hyperparameters that need to be tuned at the target upscaled model size, which is prohibitively costly to do directly. It remains unclear whether the most common workaround -- tuning on smaller models and extrapolating via hyperparameter scaling laws -- is still sound when using upscaling. We address this with principled approaches to upscaling with respect to model widths and efficiently tuning hyperparameters in this setting. First, motivated by $\u03bc$P and any-dimensional architectures, we introduce a general upscaling method applicable to a broad range of architectures and optimizers, backed by theory guaranteeing that models are equivalent to their widened versions and allowing for rigorous analysis of infinite-width limits. Second, we extend the theory of $\u03bc$Transfer to a hyperparameter transfer technique for models upscaled using our method and empirically demonstrate that this method is effective on realistic datasets and architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u653e\u5927\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u03bcP\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u653e\u5927\u540e\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u52a0\u5bbd\u7248\u672c\u7b49\u4ef7\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u03bcTransfer\u7406\u8bba\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5728\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u76f4\u63a5\u8c03\u53c2\u7684\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u901a\u5e38\u4ee5\u591a\u79cd\u5c3a\u5bf8\u53d1\u5e03\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u9884\u7b97\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u653e\u5927\u6280\u672f\uff08\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u5728\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u5728\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8c03\u53c2\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u5916\u63a8\u662f\u5426\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u6548\u3002", "method": "1. \u57fa\u4e8e\u03bcP\u548c\u4efb\u610f\u7ef4\u5ea6\u67b6\u6784\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u653e\u5927\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5176\u52a0\u5bbd\u7248\u672c\u7b49\u4ef7\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u9650\u5bbd\u5ea6\u6781\u9650\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u5206\u6790\u30022. \u6269\u5c55\u03bcTransfer\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u653e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8fc1\u79fb\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5c06\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4ece\u8f83\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u653e\u5927\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u5728\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u76f4\u63a5\u8c03\u53c2\u7684\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u653e\u5927\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8fc1\u79fb\u6280\u672f\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u653e\u5927\u4e2d\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

To explain the gap between worst-case hardness and empirical success, we introduce problem distributions generated by a reference policy $q$, including a latent-variable model in which proofs exhibit reusable cut/lemma/sketch structure represented by a proof DAG. Under a top-$k$ search protocol and Tsybakov-type margin conditions, we derive lower bounds on finite-horizon success probability that decompose into search and learning terms, with learning controlled by sequential Rademacher/covering complexity. Our main separation result shows that when cut elimination expands a DAG of depth $D$ into a cut-free tree of size $\u03a9(\u039b^D)$ while the cut-aware hierarchical process has size $O(\u03bb^D)$ with $\u03bb\\ll\u039b$, a flat (cut-free) learner provably requires exponentially more data than a cut-aware hierarchical learner.

However, attempts to further improve LoopLM reasoning with reinforcement learning have failed - standard objectives such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) only assign credit to the final latent state, creating a fundamental mismatch with the model's internal computation. To resolve this, we introduce RLTT (Reward Latent Thought Trajectories), a reinforcement learning framework which distributes reward across the full latent reasoning trajectory. RLTT provides dense, trajectory-level credit assignment without relying on external verifiers and can directly replace GRPO with negligible overhead. Across extensive experiments with Ouro-2.6B-Thinking under identical training and inference conditions, RLTT yields substantial improvements over GRPO on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, improving accuracy by +14.4% on MATH-500, +16.6% on AIME24, and +10.0% on BeyondAIME.

However, this sequential generation process is notoriously slow. While caching strategies have proven effective for accelerating traditional video diffusion models, existing methods assume uniform denoising across all frames-an assumption that breaks down in autoregressive models where different video chunks exhibit varying similarity patterns at identical timesteps. In this paper, we present FlowCache, the first caching framework specifically designed for autoregressive video generation. Our key insight is that each video chunk should maintain independent caching policies, allowing fine-grained control over which chunks require recomputation at each timestep. We introduce a chunkwise caching strategy that dynamically adapts to the unique denoising characteristics of each chunk, complemented by a joint importance-redundancy optimized KV cache compression mechanism that maintains fixed memory bounds while preserving generation quality. Our method achieves remarkable speedups of 2.38 times on MAGI-1 and 6.7 times on SkyReels-V2, with negligible quality degradation (VBench: 0.87 increase and 0.79 decrease respectively). These results demonstrate that FlowCache successfully unlocks the potential of autoregressive models for real-time, ultra-long video generation-establishing a new benchmark for efficient video synthesis at scale.

We decompose this into three technical challenges: spectral interaction contamination, limited spectral pattern modeling, and complex weighting router problems. We propose a mixture of prototypes (MoP) network with: (1) Band split for spectral isolation, (2) Prototype-based spectral representation for diverse patterns, and (3) Dual-level router for adaptive spatial-aware band weighting.

However, value learning in residual RL poses unique challenges that remain poorly understood. In this work, we identify two key bottlenecks: cold start pathology, where the critic lacks knowledge of the value landscape around the base policy, and structural scale mismatch, where the residual contribution is dwarfed by the base action. Through systematic investigation, we uncover the mechanisms underlying these bottlenecks, revealing that simple yet principled solutions suffice: base-policy transitions serve as an essential value anchor for implicit warmup, and critic normalization effectively restores representation sensitivity for discerning value differences. Based on these insights, we propose DAWN (Data-Anchored Warmup and Normalization), a minimal approach targeting efficient value learning in residual RL.

Existing debiasing methods frequently yield inconsistent improvements across datasets or attain fairness by degrading overall diagnostic utility, treating fairness as a post hoc constraint rather than a property of the learned representation. In this work, we propose Stride-Net (Sensitive Attribute Resilient Learning via Disentanglement and Learnable Masking with Embedding Alignment), a fairness-aware framework that learns disease-discriminative yet demographically invariant representations for chest X-ray analysis. Stride-Net operates at the patch level, using a learnable stride-based mask to select label-aligned image regions while suppressing sensitive attribute information through adversarial confusion loss. To anchor representations in clinical semantics and discourage shortcut learning, we further enforce semantic alignment between image features and BioBERT-based disease label embeddings via Group Optimal Transport. We evaluate Stride-Net on the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert benchmarks across race and intersectional race-gender subgroups. Across architectures including ResNet and Vision Transformers, Stride-Net consistently improves fairness metrics while matching or exceeding baseline accuracy, achieving a more favorable accuracy-fairness trade-off than prior debiasing approaches.

While models such as MedGemini achieve high accuracy on VQA tasks like USMLE MM, their performance on ECG based tasks remains limited, and some models, such as MedGemma, do not support ECG data at all. Interpreting ECGs is inherently challenging, and diagnostic accuracy can vary depending on the interpreter's experience. Although echocardiography provides rich diagnostic information, it requires specialized equipment and personnel, limiting its availability. In this study, we focus on constructing a robust ECG encoder for multimodal pretraining using real world hospital data. We employ SigLIP, a CLIP based model with a sigmoid based loss function enabling multi label prediction, and introduce a modified loss function tailored to the multi label nature of ECG data. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating medical knowledge in the language model and applying the modified loss significantly improve multi label ECG classification. To further enhance performance, we increase the embedding dimensionality and apply random cropping to mitigate data drift.

Clinical EEG recordings exceed LLM context windows, requiring extreme compression (400:1+ ratios) that destroys fine-grained temporal precision. A 0.5 Hz error distinguishes absence epilepsy from Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. LLMs lack inherent time-series comprehension and rely on statistical associations from compressed representations. This dual limitation causes systems to hallucinate clinically incorrect measurement values.\n  We separate measurement extraction from text generation. Our hybrid architecture computes exact clinical values via signal processing before compression, employs a cross-modal bridge for EEG-to-language translation, and uses parameter-efficient fine-tuning with constrained decoding around frozen slots.

Existing approaches largely rely on supervised fine-tuning, encouraging surface-level token imitation rather than faithful modeling of underlying chart structure, which often leads to hallucinated or semantically inconsistent outputs. We propose Chart Specification, a structured intermediate representation that shifts training from text imitation to semantically grounded supervision. Chart Specification filters syntactic noise to construct a structurally balanced training set and supports a Spec-Align Reward that provides fine-grained, verifiable feedback on structural correctness, enabling reinforcement learning to enforce consistent plotting logic. Experiments on three public benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms prior approaches. With only 3K training samples, we achieve strong data efficiency, surpassing leading baselines by up to 61.7% on complex benchmarks, and scaling to 4K samples establishes new state-of-the-art results across all evaluated metrics. Overall, our results demonstrate that precise structural supervision offers an efficient pathway to high-fidelity chart-to-code generation.

However, the redundant modeling of static regions and the lack of deep interaction with trajectories hinder world models from exerting their full effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Temporal Residual World Model (TR-World), which focuses on dynamic object modeling. By calculating the temporal residuals of scene representations, the information of dynamic objects can be extracted without relying on detection and tracking. TR-World takes only temporal residuals as input, thus predicting the future spatial distribution of dynamic objects more precisely. By combining the prediction with the static object information contained in the current BEV features, accurate future BEV features can be obtained. Furthermore, we propose Future-Guided Trajectory Refinement (FGTR) module, which conducts interaction between prior trajectories (predicted from the current scene representation) and the future BEV features. This module can not only utilize future road conditions to refine trajectories, but also provides sparse spatial-temporal supervision on future BEV features to prevent world model collapse.

Unified Sequence Parallelism (USP), which combines Ulysses and Ring attention mechanisms, has emerged as the state-of-the-art approach for distributed attention computation. However, existing USP implementations suffer from significant inefficiencies including excessive kernel launch overhead and suboptimal computation-communication scheduling. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{FastUSP}, a multi-level optimization framework that integrates compile-level optimization (graph compilation with CUDA Graphs and computation-communication reordering), communication-level optimization (FP8 quantized collective communication), and operator-level optimization (pipelined Ring attention with double buffering). We evaluate FastUSP on FLUX (12B) and Qwen-Image models across 2, 4, and 8 NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPUs. On FLUX, FastUSP achieves consistent \\textbf{1.12$\\times$--1.16$\\times$} end-to-end speedup over baseline USP, with compile-level optimization contributing the dominant improvement. On Qwen-Image, FastUSP achieves \\textbf{1.09$\\times$} speedup on 2 GPUs; on 4--8 GPUs, we identify a PyTorch Inductor compatibility limitation with Ring attention that prevents compile optimization, while baseline USP scales to 1.30$\\times$--1.46$\\times$ of 2-GPU performance.

Recent approaches have successfully leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate equation hypotheses, capitalizing on their vast pre-trained scientific priors. However, existing frameworks predominantly treat the LLM as a static generator, relying on prompt-level guidance to steer exploration. This paradigm fails to update the model's internal representations based on search feedback, often yielding physically inconsistent or mathematically redundant expressions. In this work, we propose PiT-PO (Physics-informed Token-regularized Policy Optimization), a unified framework that evolves the LLM into an adaptive generator via reinforcement learning. Central to PiT-PO is a dual-constraint mechanism that rigorously enforces hierarchical physical validity while simultaneously applying fine-grained, token-level penalties to suppress redundant structures. Consequently, PiT-PO aligns LLM to produce equations that are both scientifically consistent and structurally parsimonious. Empirically, PiT-PO achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks and successfully discovers novel turbulence models for challenging fluid dynamics problems. We also demonstrate that PiT-PO empowers small-scale models to outperform closed-source giants, democratizing access to high-performance scientific discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPiT-PO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06LLM\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u548ctoken\u7ea7\u60e9\u7f5a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u7ed3\u6784\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u7a0b\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6839\u636e\u641c\u7d22\u53cd\u9988\u66f4\u65b0\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7269\u7406\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6216\u6570\u5b66\u5197\u4f59\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "PiT-PO\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u5316LLM\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u7ea6\u675f\u673a\u5236\uff08\u5c42\u6b21\u7269\u7406\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7ea6\u675f+token\u7ea7\u60e9\u7f5a\uff09\u6291\u5236\u5197\u4f59\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u53d1\u73b0\u6311\u6218\u6027\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b0\u6e4d\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u8d85\u8d8a\u95ed\u6e90\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "PiT-PO\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u79d1\u5b66\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u7ed3\u6784\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u6c11\u4e3b\u5316\uff0c\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u5927\u578b\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Standard Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) offer clear feature attributions but are often constrained by their strictly additive nature, which can limit predictive performance. Introducing feature interactions can boost accuracy yet may obscure individual feature contributions. To address these issues, we propose Neural Additive Experts (NAEs), a novel framework that seamlessly balances interpretability and accuracy. NAEs employ a mixture of experts framework, learning multiple specialized networks per feature, while a dynamic gating mechanism integrates information across features, thereby relaxing rigid additive constraints. Furthermore, we propose targeted regularization techniques to mitigate variance among expert predictions, facilitating a smooth transition from an exclusively additive model to one that captures intricate feature interactions while maintaining clarity in feature attributions. Our theoretical analysis and experiments on synthetic data illustrate the model's flexibility, and extensive evaluations on real-world datasets confirm that NAEs achieve an optimal balance between predictive accuracy and transparent, feature-level explanations.

The probability of these outputs can be reduced using methods such as LLM unlearning. However, unlearning a set of data (called the forget set) can degrade model performance on other distributions where the trainer wants to retain the model's behavior. To improve this trade-off, we demonstrate that using the forget set to compute only a few uphill Gauss-Newton steps provides a conceptually simple, state-of-the-art unlearning approach for LLMs. While Gauss-Newton steps adapt Newton's method to non-linear models, it is non-trivial to efficiently and accurately compute such steps for LLMs. Hence, our approach crucially relies on parametric Hessian approximations such as Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC). We call this combined approach K-FADE (K-FAC for Distribution Erasure). Our evaluation on the WMDP and ToFU benchmarks demonstrates that K-FADE suppresses outputs from the forget set and approximates, in output space, the results of retraining without the forget set. Critically, our method does this while altering the outputs on the retain set less than previous methods. This is because K-FADE transforms a constraint on the model's outputs across the entire retain set into a constraint on the model's weights, allowing the algorithm to minimally change the model's behavior on the retain set at each step. Moreover, the unlearning updates computed by K-FADE can be reapplied later if the model undergoes further training, allowing unlearning to be cheaply maintained.", "AI": {"tldr": "K-FADE\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eK-FAC\u8fd1\u4f3cHessian\u7684LLM\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u4e0a\u5761\u9ad8\u65af-\u725b\u987f\u6b65\u9aa4\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u9057\u5fd8\u96c6\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5bf9\u4fdd\u7559\u96c6\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfLLM\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6291\u5236\u4e0d\u826f\u8f93\u51fa\u65f6\uff0c\u5f80\u5f80\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\u548c\u4fdd\u7559\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u505a\u51fa\u6743\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faK-FADE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u9057\u5fd8\u96c6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5c11\u91cf\u4e0a\u5761\u9ad8\u65af-\u725b\u987f\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5229\u7528K-FAC\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u5316Hessian\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5c06\u8f93\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6743\u91cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5728WMDP\u548cToFU\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cK-FADE\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u9057\u5fd8\u96c6\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8fbe\u5230\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u4fdd\u7559\u96c6\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u6539\u53d8\u5c0f\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u9057\u5fd8\u66f4\u65b0\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "K-FADE\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6982\u5ff5\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684LLM\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9ad8\u65af-\u725b\u987f\u6b65\u9aa4\u5728\u9057\u5fd8\u4e0d\u826f\u8f93\u51fa\u548c\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u7528\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

Early identification is important for minimizing damage and ensuring fruit health. This study focuses on 3 different categories for classifying diseases. These are Anthracnose, Fruit flies, and Healthy fruit. The data set used in this study is collected from Mendeley Data. This dataset contains 473 original images of Guava. These images vary in size and format. The original dataset was resized to 256x256 pixels with RGB color mode for better consistency. After this, the Data augmentation process is applied to improve the dataset by generating variations of the original images. The augmented dataset consists of 3784 images using advanced preprocessing techniques. Two deep learning models were implemented to classify the images. The InceptionV3 model is well known for its advanced framework. These apply multiple convolutional filters for obtaining different features effectively. On the other hand, the ResNet50 model helps to train deeper networks by using residual learning. The InceptionV3 model achieved the impressive accuracy of 98.15%, and ResNet50got 94.46% accuracy.

However, the elongated morphology, wide scale variation, and low contrast of retinal vessels pose significant challenges for existing methods, making it difficult to simultaneously preserve fine capillaries and maintain global topological continuity. To address these challenges, we propose the Vessel-aware Frequency-domain and Global Spatial modeling Network (VFGS-Net), an end-to-end segmentation framework that seamlessly integrates frequency-aware feature enhancement, dual-path convolutional representation learning, and bidirectional asymmetric spatial state-space modeling within a unified architecture. Specifically, VFGS-Net employs a dual-path feature convolution module to jointly capture fine-grained local textures and multi-scale contextual semantics. A novel vessel-aware frequency-domain channel attention mechanism is introduced to adaptively reweight spectral components, thereby enhancing vessel-relevant responses in high-level features. Furthermore, at the network bottleneck, we propose a bidirectional asymmetric Mamba2-based spatial modeling block to efficiently capture long-range spatial dependencies and strengthen the global continuity of vascular structures. Extensive experiments on four publicly available retinal vessel datasets demonstrate that VFGS-Net achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

These challenges include numerical heterogeneity arising from the decoupling of positional embeddings, misalignment of quantization scales in FP8 PV GEMM, and the need for optimized system-level support. In this paper, we introduce SnapMLA, an FP8 MLA decoding framework optimized to improve long-context efficiency through the following hardware-aware algorithm-kernel co-optimization techniques: (i) RoPE-Aware Per-Token KV Quantization, where the RoPE part is maintained in high precision, motivated by our comprehensive analysis of the heterogeneous quantization sensitivity inherent to the MLA KV cache. Furthermore, per-token granularity is employed to align with the autoregressive decoding process and maintain quantization accuracy. (ii) Quantized PV Computation Pipeline Reconstruction, which resolves the misalignment of quantization scale in FP8 PV computation stemming from the shared KV structure of the MLA KV cache.

The clipping threshold is a critical control knob: if set too small, systematic over-clipping induces optimization bias; if too large, injected noise dominates updates and degrades accuracy. Existing adaptive clipping methods often depend on per-example gradient norm statistics, adding computational overhead and introducing sensitivity to datasets and architectures. We propose a control-driven clipping strategy that adapts the threshold using a lightweight, weight-only spectral diagnostic computed from model parameters. At periodic probe steps, the method analyzes a designated weight matrix via spectral decomposition and estimates a heavy-tailed spectral indicator associated with training stability. This indicator is smoothed over time and fed into a bounded feedback controller that updates the clipping threshold multiplicatively in the log domain. Because the controller uses only parameters produced during privacy-preserving training, the resulting threshold updates are post-processing and do not increase privacy loss beyond that of the underlying DP optimizer under standard composition accounting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a7\u5236\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68af\u5ea6\u88c1\u526a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u8c03\u6574\u88c1\u526a\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u88c1\u526a\u6216\u566a\u58f0\u4e3b\u5bfc\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u68af\u5ea6\u88c1\u526a\u9608\u503c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u662f\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u9608\u503c\u8fc7\u5c0f\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8fc7\u88c1\u526a\u5f15\u8d77\u4f18\u5316\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u9608\u503c\u8fc7\u5927\u4f1a\u4f7f\u6ce8\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u4e3b\u5bfc\u66f4\u65b0\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9010\u6837\u672c\u68af\u5ea6\u7edf\u8ba1\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u4e14\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u654f\u611f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u63a7\u5236\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u88c1\u526a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u4ec5\u6743\u91cd\u8c31\u8bca\u65ad\u6765\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u9608\u503c\u3002\u5728\u5468\u671f\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6307\u5b9a\u6743\u91cd\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u8c31\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u91cd\u5c3e\u8c31\u6307\u6807\u3002\u8be5\u6307\u6807\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u540e\u8f93\u5165\u6709\u754c\u53cd\u9988\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u5728log\u57df\u4e2d\u4e58\u6cd5\u66f4\u65b0\u88c1\u526a\u9608\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9608\u503c\u66f4\u65b0\u662f\u540e\u5904\u7406\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u7ec4\u5408\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0b\u4e0d\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u5e95\u5c42DP\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u635f\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u9a71\u52a8\u88c1\u526a\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68af\u5ea6\u88c1\u526a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u88c1\u526a\u9608\u503c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Our dataset provides a more balanced demographic distribution than the existing public datasets, with one partition that is nearly uniformly distributed, facilitating the development of automated ICAO compliance verification methods.\n  Using DFIC, we fine-tuned a novel method that heavily relies on spatial attention mechanisms for the automatic validation of ICAO compliance requirements, and we have compared it with the state-of-the-art aimed at ICAO compliance verification, demonstrating improved results. DFIC dataset is now made public (https://github.com/visteam-isr-uc/DFIC) for the training and validation of new models, offering an unprecedented diversity of faces, that will improve both robustness and adaptability to the intrinsically diverse combinations of faces and props that can be presented to the validation system.

In this work, we adapt our previously proposed SVD-Inspired Attention (SVDA) mechanism to the ViT architecture, introducing a geometrically grounded formulation that enhances interpretability, sparsity, and spectral structure. We apply the use of interpretability indicators -- originally proposed with SVDA -- to monitor attention dynamics during training and assess structural properties of the learned representations. Experimental evaluations on four widely used benchmarks -- CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-100 -- demonstrate that SVDA consistently yields more interpretable attention patterns without sacrificing classification accuracy. While the current framework offers descriptive insights rather than prescriptive guidance, our results establish SVDA as a comprehensive and informative tool for analyzing and developing structured attention models in computer vision.

We propose Bayesian Non-Negative Reward Model (BNRM), a principled reward modeling framework that integrates non-negative factor analysis into Bradley-Terry (BT) preference model. BNRM represents rewards through a sparse, non-negative latent factor generative process that operates at two complementary levels: instance-specific latent variables induce disentangled reward representations, while sparsity over global latent factors acts as an implicit debiasing mechanism that suppresses spurious correlations. Together, this disentanglement-then-debiasing structure enables robust uncertainty-aware reward learning. To scale BNRM to modern LLMs, we develop an amortized variational inference network conditioned on deep model representations, allowing efficient end-to-end training.

In this work, we reinterpret RoPE as phase modulation applied to a bank of complex oscillators, enabling analysis through classical signal processing theory.\n  Under this formulation, we derive principled lower bounds on the RoPE base parameter that are necessary to preserve positional coherence over a target context length. These include a fundamental aliasing bound, analogous to a Nyquist limit, and a DC-component stability bound that constrains phase drift in low-frequency positional modes. We further extend this analysis to deep transformers, showing that repeated rotary modulation across layers compounds angular misalignment, tightening the base requirement as depth increases.\n  Complementing these results, we derive a precision-dependent upper bound on the RoPE base arising from finite floating-point resolution. Beyond this limit, incremental phase updates become numerically indistinguishable, leading to positional erasure even in the absence of aliasing. Together, the lower and upper bounds define a precision- and depth-dependent feasibility region a Goldilocks zone for long-context transformers.\n  We validate the framework through a comprehensive case study of state-of-the-art models, including LLaMA, Mistral, and DeepSeek variants, showing that observed successes, failures, and community retrofits align closely with the predicted bounds.

To address this, we study the two-model risk change, $\u0394R := R_P(\\tilde{Q}) - R_P(Q)$, under covariate shift. We introduce TRACE (Theoretical Risk Attribution under Covariate-shift Effects), a framework that decomposes $|\u0394R|$ into an interpretable upper bound. This decomposition disentangles the risk change into four actionable factors: two generalization gaps, a model change penalty, and a covariate shift penalty, transforming the bound into a powerful diagnostic tool for understanding why performance has changed. To make TRACE a fully computable diagnostic, we instantiate each term. The covariate shift penalty is estimated via a model sensitivity factor (from high-quantile input gradients) and a data-shift measure; we use feature-space Optimal Transport (OT) by default and provide a robust alternative using Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). The model change penalty is controlled by the average output distance between the two models on the target sample. Generalization gaps are estimated on held-out data. We validate our framework in an idealized linear regression setting, showing the TRACE bound correctly captures the scaling of the true risk difference with the magnitude of the shift. Across synthetic and vision benchmarks, TRACE diagnostics are valid and maintain a strong monotonic relationship with the true performance degradation.

However, achieving real-time DNN inference in the AV's perception pipeline is challenging due to the large gap between the computation requirement and the AV's limited resources. Most, if not all, of existing studies focus on optimizing the DNN inference time to achieve faster perception by compressing the DNN model with pruning and quantization. In contrast, we present a Predictable Perception system with DNNs (PP-DNN) that reduce the amount of image data to be processed while maintaining the same level of accuracy for multi-tenant DNNs by dynamically selecting critical frames and regions of interest (ROIs). PP-DNN is based on our key insight that critical frames and ROIs for AVs vary with the AV's surrounding environment. However, it is challenging to identify and use critical frames and ROIs in multi-tenant DNNs for predictable inference. Given image-frame streams, PP-DNN leverages an ROI generator to identify critical frames and ROIs based on the similarities of consecutive frames and traffic scenarios. PP-DNN then leverages a FLOPs predictor to predict multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) from the dynamic critical frames and ROIs. The ROI scheduler coordinates the processing of critical frames and ROIs with multiple DNN models. Finally, we design a detection predictor for the perception of non-critical frames. We have implemented PP-DNN in an ROS-based AV pipeline and evaluated it with the BDD100K and the nuScenes dataset. PP-DNN is observed to significantly enhance perception predictability, increasing the number of fusion frames by up to 7.3x, reducing the fusion delay by >2.6x and fusion-delay variations by >2.3x, improving detection completeness by 75.4% and the cost-effectiveness by up to 98% over the baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "PP-DNN\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u548c\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u533a\u57df\u6765\u51cf\u5c11AV\u611f\u77e5\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u5904\u7406\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u591a\u79df\u6237DNN\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u611f\u77e5\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u9700\u8981\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6DNN\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "PP-DNN\u7cfb\u7edf\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1aROI\u751f\u6210\u5668\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u548cROI\uff1bFLOPs\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u9884\u6d4bMAC\u64cd\u4f5c\uff1bROI\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u534f\u8c03\u591aDNN\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\uff1b\u68c0\u6d4b\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u5904\u7406\u975e\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "result": "\u5728BDD100K\u548cnuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cPP-DNN\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u611f\u77e5\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\uff1a\u878d\u5408\u5e27\u6570\u589e\u52a07.3\u500d\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u5ef6\u8fdf\u51cf\u5c112.6\u500d\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u53d8\u5316\u51cf\u5c112.3\u500d\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u63d0\u9ad875.4%\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u63d0\u534798%\u3002", "conclusion": "PP-DNN\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u548cROI\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u91cf\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86AV\u611f\u77e5\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65f6DNN\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Operating under a global compression budget, ROCKET comprises two key innovations: First, it formulates layer-wise compression allocation as a multi-choice knapsack problem, selecting the optimal compression level for each layer to minimize total reconstruction error while adhering to a target model size. Second, it introduces a single-step sparse matrix factorization inspired by dictionary learning: using only a small calibration set, it sparsifies weight coefficients based on activation-weights sensitivity and then updates the dictionary in closed form via least squares bypassing iterative optimization, sparse coding, or backpropagation entirely. ROCKET consistently outperforms existing compression approaches across different model architectures at 20-50\\% compression rates. Notably, it retains over 90\\% of the original model's performance at 30\\% compression without any fine-tuning. Moreover, when applying a light fine-tuning phase, recovery is substantially enhanced: for instance, compressing Qwen3-14B to an 8B-parameter model and healing it with just 30 million tokens yields performance nearly on par with the original Qwen3-8B.

We propose RI-FedAvg, a novel FL algorithm that mitigates client drift by incorporating a Roughness Index (RI)-based regularization term into the local objective, adaptively penalizing updates based on the fluctuations of local loss landscapes. This paper introduces RI-FedAvg, leveraging the RI to quantify the roughness of high-dimensional loss functions, ensuring robust optimization in heterogeneous settings.

We introduce SVD-Inspired Attention (SVDA) into the Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT), providing the first spectrally structured formulation of attention for dense prediction tasks. SVDA decouples directional alignment from spectral modulation by embedding a learnable diagonal matrix into normalized query-key interactions, enabling attention maps that are intrinsically interpretable rather than post-hoc approximations. Experiments on KITTI and NYU-v2 show that SVDA preserves or slightly improves predictive accuracy while adding only minor computational overhead. More importantly, SVDA unlocks six spectral indicators that quantify entropy, rank, sparsity, alignment, selectivity, and robustness. These reveal consistent cross-dataset and depth-wise patterns in how attention organizes during training, insights that remain inaccessible in standard Transformers. By shifting the role of attention from opaque mechanism to quantifiable descriptor, SVDA redefines interpretability in monocular depth estimation and opens a principled avenue toward transparent dense prediction models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSVDA\uff08SVD-Inspired Attention\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u8c31\u7ed3\u6784\u5f15\u5165DPT\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u516d\u4e2a\u8c31\u6307\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dTransformer\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u8fd9\u4e00\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u91cf\u5316\u7406\u89e3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4f9d\u8d56\u540e\u9a8c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002", "method": "\u5728Dense Prediction Transformer\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165SVD-Inspired Attention\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u67e5\u8be2-\u952e\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5bf9\u89d2\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5c06\u65b9\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u8c31\u8c03\u5236\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5185\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u5728KITTI\u548cNYU-v2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSVDA\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u7565\u5fae\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ec5\u589e\u52a0\u5c11\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\uff0cSVDA\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u516d\u4e2a\u8c31\u6307\u6807\uff08\u71b5\u3001\u79e9\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3001\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "SVDA\u5c06\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u4ece\u9ed1\u76d2\u673a\u5236\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u900f\u660e\u5bc6\u96c6\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

These documents are heterogeneous collections such as emails, legal texts, and spreadsheets compiled into single PDFs, where semantic ordering signals are unreliable. We compare five methods, including pointer networks, seq2seq transformers, and specialized pairwise ranking models. The best performing approach successfully reorders documents up to 15 pages, with Kendall's tau ranging from 0.95 for short documents (2-5 pages) to 0.72 for 15 page documents. We observe two unexpected failures: seq2seq transformers fail to generalize on long documents (Kendall's tau drops from 0.918 on 2-5 pages to 0.014 on 21-25 pages), and curriculum learning underperforms direct training by 39% on long documents. Ablation studies suggest learned positional encodings are one contributing factor to seq2seq failure, though the degradation persists across all encoding variants, indicating multiple interacting causes. Attention pattern analysis reveals that short and long documents require fundamentally different ordering strategies, explaining why curriculum learning fails. Model specialization achieves substantial improvements on longer documents (+0.21 tau).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u9875\u9762\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf95,461\u4e2aWOO\u6587\u6863\u8fdb\u884c\u9875\u9762\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u6392\u5e8f\u6700\u591a15\u9875\u7684\u6587\u6863\uff0c\u4f46\u5e8f\u5217\u5230\u5e8f\u5217Transformer\u5728\u957f\u6587\u6863\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u5dee\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "WOO\u6587\u6863\u662f\u5305\u542b\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6587\u672c\u548c\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u7b49\u5f02\u6784\u5185\u5bb9\u7684PDF\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u6392\u5e8f\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6587\u6863\u9875\u9762\u6392\u5e8f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9875\u9762\u5d4c\u5165\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u6307\u9488\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u5e8f\u5217\u5230\u5e8f\u5217Transformer\u3001\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u6210\u5bf9\u6392\u5e8f\u6a21\u578b\u7b49\uff0c\u57285,461\u4e2a\u6253\u4e71\u7684WOO\u6587\u6863\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u6392\u5e8f\u6700\u591a15\u9875\u7684\u6587\u6863\uff0cKendall's tau\u4ece\u77ed\u6587\u6863(2-5\u9875)\u76840.95\u4e0b\u964d\u523015\u9875\u6587\u6863\u76840.72\u3002\u5e8f\u5217\u5230\u5e8f\u5217Transformer\u5728\u957f\u6587\u6863\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0b\u964d(\u4ece0.918\u964d\u81f30.014)\uff0c\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u6bd4\u76f4\u63a5\u8bad\u7ec3\u5dee39%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u77ed\u6587\u6863\u548c\u957f\u6587\u6863\u9700\u8981\u6839\u672c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u957f\u6587\u6863\u6392\u5e8f\u6027\u80fd(+0.21 tau)\u3002\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u662f\u5e8f\u5217\u5230\u5e8f\u5217\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4f46\u591a\u79cd\u56e0\u7d20\u5171\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002"}}

However, existing methods suffer from the query initialization dilemma due to the sparse nature of point clouds and rely on computationally intensive attention mechanisms in query decoders. We accordingly introduce LaSSM, prioritizing simplicity and efficiency while maintaining competitive performance. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical semantic-spatial query initializer to derive the query set from superpoints by considering both semantic cues and spatial distribution, achieving comprehensive scene coverage and accelerated convergence. We further present a coordinate-guided state space model (SSM) decoder that progressively refines queries. The novel decoder features a local aggregation scheme that restricts the model to focus on geometrically coherent regions and a spatial dual-path SSM block to capture underlying dependencies within the query set by integrating associated coordinates information. Our design enables efficient instance prediction, avoiding the incorporation of noisy information and reducing redundant computation. LaSSM ranks first place on the latest ScanNet++ V2 leaderboard, outperforming the previous best method by 2.5% mAP with only 1/3 FLOPs, demonstrating its superiority in challenging large-scale scene instance segmentation. LaSSM also achieves competitive performance on ScanNet, ScanNet200, S3DIS and ScanNet++ V1 benchmarks with less computational cost. Extensive ablation studies and qualitative results validate the effectiveness of our design.

Recently the proposal of ''thinking with images'' attempts to alleviate this limitation by manipulating images via external tools or code; however, the resulting visual states are often insufficiently grounded in linguistic semantics, impairing effective cross-modal alignment - particularly when visual semantics or geometric relationships must be reasoned over across distant regions or multiple images. To address these challenges, we propose ''chatting with images'', a new framework that reframes visual manipulation as language-guided feature modulation. Under the guidance of expressive language prompts, the model dynamically performs joint re-encoding over multiple image regions, enabling tighter coupling between linguistic reasoning and visual state updates. We instantiate this paradigm in ViLaVT, a novel LVLM equipped with a dynamic vision encoder explicitly designed for such interactive visual reasoning, and trained it with a two-stage curriculum combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to promote effective reasoning behaviors. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks demonstrate that ViLaVT achieves strong and consistent improvements, with particularly pronounced gains on complex multi-image and video-based spatial reasoning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "ViLaVT\u63d0\u51fa\"chatting with images\"\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8c03\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u6b21\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u8fdb\u884c\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u3002\u867d\u7136\"thinking with images\"\u5c1d\u8bd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u89c6\u89c9\u72b6\u6001\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u5173\u8054\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u8de8\u8fdc\u8ddd\u79bb\u533a\u57df\u6216\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\u6216\u51e0\u4f55\u5173\u7cfb\u63a8\u7406\u65f6", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\"chatting with images\"\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u64cd\u4f5c\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8c03\u5236\u3002\u5728\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e0b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u5bf9\u591a\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u91cd\u65b0\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u72b6\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3aViLaVT\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u914d\u5907\u4e13\u95e8\u4e3a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03+\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff09", "result": "\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cViLaVT\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u4e14\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7684\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8c03\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u7684\"chatting with images\"\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb"}}

This version includes additional authors who contributed during the rebuttal phase", "summary": "Accurate counting of surgical instruments in Operating Rooms (OR) is a critical prerequisite for ensuring patient safety during surgery. Despite recent progress of large visual-language models and agentic AI, accurately counting such instruments remains highly challenging, particularly in dense scenarios where instruments are tightly clustered. To address this problem, we introduce Chain-of-Look, a novel visual reasoning framework that mimics the sequential human counting process by enforcing a structured visual chain, rather than relying on classic object detection which is unordered. This visual chain guides the model to count along a coherent spatial trajectory, improving accuracy in complex scenes.

Policy staleness, asynchronous training, and mismatches between training and inference engines all cause the behavior policy to diverge from the current policy, risking training collapse. Importance sampling provides a principled correction for this distribution shift but suffers from high variance; existing remedies such as token-level clipping and sequence-level normalization lack a unified theoretical foundation. We propose Variational sEquence-level Soft Policy Optimization (VESPO). By incorporating variance reduction into a variational formulation over proposal distributions, VESPO derives a closed-form reshaping kernel that operates directly on sequence-level importance weights without length normalization. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that VESPO maintains stable training under staleness ratios up to 64x and fully asynchronous execution, and delivers consistent gains across both dense and Mixture-of-Experts models.

While recent advances in self-supervised depth estimation have reduced reliance on ground truth supervision, existing approaches remain constrained by either bulky architectures compromising practicality or lightweight models sacrificing structural precision. These dual limitations underscore the critical need to develop lightweight yet structurally precise architectures. Our framework addresses these limitations through a three-stage architecture incorporating three novel modules: the Shuffle-Dilation Convolution (SDC) module for local feature extraction, the Rotation-Adaptive Kernel Attention (RAKA) module for hierarchical feature enhancement, and the Deep Frequency Signal Purification (DFSP) module for global feature purification. Through effective collaboration, these modules enable PuriLight to achieve both lightweight and accurate feature extraction and processing.

In practice, however, PINNs are frequently trained using experimental or numerical data that are not fully consistent with the governing equations due to measurement noise, discretization errors, or modeling assumptions. The implications of such data-to-PDE inconsistencies on the accuracy and convergence of PINNs remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we systematically analyze how data inconsistency fundamentally limits the attainable accuracy of PINNs. We introduce the concept of a consistency barrier, defined as an intrinsic lower bound on the error that arises from mismatches between the fidelity of the data and the exact enforcement of the PDE residual. To isolate and quantify this effect, we consider the 1D viscous Burgers equation with a manufactured analytical solution, which enables full control over data fidelity and residual errors. PINNs are trained using datasets of progressively increasing numerical accuracy, as well as perfectly consistent analytical data. Results show that while the inclusion of the PDE residual allows PINNs to partially mitigate low-fidelity data and recover the dominant physical structure, the training process ultimately saturates at an error level dictated by the data inconsistency. When high-fidelity numerical data are employed, PINN solutions become indistinguishable from those trained on analytical data, indicating that the consistency barrier is effectively removed.

While deep GLAD methods have shown promising performance, their black-box nature limits their reliability and deployment in real-world applications. Although some recent methods have made attempts to provide explanations for anomaly detection results, they either provide explanations without referencing normal graphs, or rely on abstract latent vectors as prototypes rather than concrete graphs from the dataset. To address these limitations, we propose Prototype-based Graph-Level Anomaly Detection (ProtoGLAD), an interpretable unsupervised framework that provides explanation for each detected anomaly by explicitly contrasting with its nearest normal prototype graph. It employs a point-set kernel to iteratively discover multiple normal prototype graphs and their associated clusters from the dataset, then identifying graphs distant from all discovered normal clusters as anomalies. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that ProtoGLAD achieves competitive anomaly detection performance compared to state-of-the-art GLAD methods while providing better human-interpretable prototype-based explanations.", "AI": {"tldr": "ProtoGLAD\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u578b\u7684\u56fe\u7ea7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5f02\u5e38\u56fe\u4e0e\u5176\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u6b63\u6001\u539f\u578b\u56fe\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u7ea7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6709\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c1d\u8bd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4f46\u8981\u4e48\u6ca1\u6709\u53c2\u8003\u6b63\u6001\u56fe\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5411\u91cf\u800c\u975e\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u56fe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u539f\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u70b9\u96c6\u6838\u8fed\u4ee3\u5730\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u4e2a\u6b63\u6001\u539f\u578b\u56fe\u53ca\u5176\u5173\u8054\u7c07\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u8fdc\u79bb\u6240\u6709\u6b63\u6001\u7c07\u7684\u56fe\u8bc6\u522b\u4e3a\u5f02\u5e38\u3002\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u8fd1\u6b63\u6001\u539f\u578b\u56fe\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cProtoGLAD\u5728\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684GLAD\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u539f\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "ProtoGLAD\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u660e\u786e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5f02\u5e38\u4e0e\u5176\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u6b63\u6001\u539f\u578b\u56fe\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

However, hyperparameter optimization and scaling laws have been studied primarily from the perspective of the base model's validation loss, ignoring downstream adaptability. In this work, we study pretraining from the perspective of model plasticity, that is, the ability of the base model to successfully adapt to downstream tasks through fine-tuning. We focus on the role of weight decay, a key regularization parameter during pretraining. Through systematic experiments, we show that models trained with larger weight decay values are more plastic, meaning they show larger performance gains when fine-tuned on downstream tasks. This phenomenon can lead to counterintuitive trade-offs where base models that perform worse after pretraining can perform better after fine-tuning. Further investigation of weight decay's mechanistic effects on model behavior reveals that it encourages linearly separable representations, regularizes attention matrices, and reduces overfitting on the training data.

Accurate assessment is vital for adaptive learning, clinical monitoring, and brain-computer interfaces. Physiological signals such as pupillometry and electroencephalography are established biomarkers of cognitive load, but their comparative utility and practical integration as lightweight, wearable monitoring solutions remain underexplored. EEG provides high temporal resolution of neural activity. Although non-invasive, it is technologically demanding and limited in wearability and cost due to its resource-intensive nature, whereas pupillometry is non-invasive, portable, and scalable. Existing studies often rely on deep learning models with limited interpretability and substantial computational expense. This study integrates feature-based and model-driven approaches to advance time-series analysis. Using the OpenNeuro 'Digit Span Task' dataset, this study investigates cognitive load classification from EEG and pupillometry. Feature-based approaches using Catch-22 features and classical machine learning models outperform deep learning in both binary and multiclass tasks. The findings demonstrate that pupillometry alone can compete with EEG, serving as a portable and practical proxy for real-world applications. These results challenge the assumption that EEG is necessary for load detection, showing that pupil dynamics combined with interpretable models and SHAP based feature analysis provide physiologically meaningful insights.

The recent release of the UNB StepUP-P150 dataset, the largest and most comprehensive collection of high-resolution footstep pressure recordings to date, opens new opportunities for addressing these challenges through deep learning. To mark this milestone, the First International StepUP Competition for Biometric Footstep Recognition was launched. Competitors were tasked with developing robust recognition models using the StepUP-P150 dataset that were then evaluated on a separate, dedicated test set designed to assess verification performance under challenging variations, given limited and relatively homogeneous reference data. The competition attracted global participation, with 23 registered teams from academia and industry. The top-performing team, Saeid_UCC, achieved the best equal error rate (EER) of 10.77% using a generative reward machine (GRM) optimization strategy.

Existing acceleration methods like distillation, trajectory truncation, and consistency approaches are static, require retraining, and often fail to generalize across tasks. We propose FastFlow, a plug-and-play adaptive inference framework that accelerates generation in flow matching models. FastFlow identifies denoising steps that produce only minor adjustments to the denoising path and approximates them without using the full neural network models used for velocity predictions. The approximation utilizes finite-difference velocity estimates from prior predictions to efficiently extrapolate future states, enabling faster advancements along the denoising path at zero compute cost. This enables skipping computation at intermediary steps. We model the decision of how many steps to safely skip before requiring a full model computation as a multi-armed bandit problem. The bandit learns the optimal skips to balance speed with performance.

Synthetic data produced by generative artificial intelligence (genAI) models trained on real data is often seen as one possible solution to comply with privacy regulations. While powerful genAI models for heterogeneous hospital time series have recently been introduced, such modeling does not guarantee privacy protection, as the generated data may still reveal identifying information about individuals in the models' training cohort. Applying established privacy mechanisms to generative time series models, however, proves challenging as post-hoc data anonymization through k-anonymization or similar techniques is limited, while model-centered privacy mechanisms that implement differential privacy (DP) may lead to unstable training, compromising the utility of generated data. Given these known limitations, privacy audits for generative time series models are currently indispensable regardless of the concrete privacy mechanisms applied to models and/or data. In this work, we use a battery of established privacy attacks to audit state-of-the-art hospital time series models, trained on the public MIMIC-IV dataset, with respect to privacy preservation. Furthermore, the eICU dataset was used to mount a privacy attack against the synthetic data generator trained on the MIMIC-IV dataset. Results show that established privacy attacks are ineffective against generated multivariate clinical time series when synthetic data generators are trained on large enough training datasets. Furthermore, we discuss how the use of existing DP mechanisms for these synthetic data generators would not bring desired improvement in privacy, but only a decrease in utility for machine learning prediction tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u533b\u7597\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u9690\u79c1\u5ba1\u8ba1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\u5728\u8db3\u591f\u5927\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u65e0\u6548\uff0c\u4e14\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u673a\u5236\u53ea\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7528\u800c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4", "motivation": "\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u9762\u4e34\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5236\uff08\u5982k-\u533f\u540d\u5316\u3001\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\uff09\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u9690\u79c1\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u9645\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6548\u679c", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5df2\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8eMIMIC-IV\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u533b\u9662\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u9690\u79c1\u5ba1\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528eICU\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5bf9MIMIC-IV\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5668\u53d1\u8d77\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb", "result": "\u5f53\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5728\u8db3\u591f\u5927\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u7684\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u4e34\u5e8a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u65e0\u6548\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5e26\u6765\u671f\u671b\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u53ea\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6548\u7528", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u533b\u7597\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8db3\u591f\u5927\u65f6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\u65e0\u6548\uff0c\u800c\u5e94\u7528\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u673a\u5236\u53ea\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7528\u800c\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7b56\u7565"}}

While existing methods successfully control body pose, they lack specific control over hair, and as a result, fail to capture the intricate hair motions, resulting in stiff and unrealistic animations. HairWeaver overcomes this limitation using two specialized modules: a Motion-Context-LoRA to integrate motion conditions and a Sim2Real-Domain-LoRA to preserve the subject's photoreal appearance across different data domains. These lightweight components are designed to guide a video diffusion backbone while maintaining its core generative capabilities. By training on a specialized dataset of dynamic human motion generated from a CG simulator, HairWeaver affords fine control over hair motion and ultimately learns to produce highly realistic hair that responds naturally to movement.

Boltzmann Generators (BGs) address this by combining exact-likelihood generative models with importance sampling, but their practical scalability is limited. Meanwhile, coarse-grained surrogates enable the modeling of larger systems by reducing effective dimensionality, yet often lack the reweighting process required to ensure asymptotically correct statistics. In this work, we propose Coarse-Grained Boltzmann Generators (CG-BGs), a principled framework that unifies scalable reduced-order modeling with the exactness of importance sampling. CG-BGs act in a coarse-grained coordinate space, using a learned potential of mean force (PMF) to reweight samples generated by a flow-based model. Crucially, we show that this PMF can be efficiently learned from rapidly converged data via force matching.

However, existing critics are primarily trained in general visual domains such as captioning or image question answering, leaving physical AI tasks involving perception, causal reasoning, and planning largely underexplored. We introduce PhyCritic, a multimodal critic model optimized for physical AI through a two-stage RLVR pipeline: a physical skill warmup stage that enhances physically oriented perception and reasoning, followed by self-referential critic finetuning, where the critic generates its own prediction as an internal reference before judging candidate responses, improving judgment stability and physical correctness. Across both physical and general-purpose multimodal judge benchmarks, PhyCritic achieves strong performance gains over open-source baselines and, when applied as a policy model, further improves perception and reasoning in physically grounded tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "PhyCritic\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u7269\u7406AI\u4efb\u52a1\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u5224\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5RLVR\u6d41\u7a0b\u63d0\u5347\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u7269\u7406\u548c\u901a\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u5224\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bc4\u5224\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5f00\u653e\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u5224\u5668\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u9886\u57df\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7269\u7406AI\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u6d89\u53ca\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u89c4\u5212\uff09\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e13\u95e8\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8bc4\u5224\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5RLVR\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a1) \u7269\u7406\u6280\u80fd\u9884\u70ed\u9636\u6bb5\u589e\u5f3a\u7269\u7406\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u63a8\u7406\uff1b2) \u81ea\u53c2\u8003\u8bc4\u5224\u5fae\u8c03\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u8bc4\u5224\u5668\u5148\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5185\u90e8\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u518d\u8bc4\u4f30\u5019\u9009\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bc4\u5224\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u7269\u7406\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7269\u7406\u548c\u901a\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u5224\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cPhyCritic\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f00\u6e90\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5f53\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "PhyCritic\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u7269\u7406AI\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u5224\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u95e8\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u7269\u7406\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8bc4\u5224\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4e3a\u7269\u7406AI\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Using techniques from Network Science and Machine Learning, including Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi for model sparsification, we enhance the efficiency of GNNs for real-world applications. We demonstrate our approach on N-1 contingency assessment in electrical grids, a critical task for ensuring grid reliability. We apply our methods to three datasets of varying sizes, exploring Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) with different degrees of sparsification and rewiring. Comparison across sparsification levels shows the potential of combining insights from both research fields to improve GNN performance and scalability. Our experiments highlight the importance of tuning sparsity parameters: while sparsity can improve generalization, excessive sparsity may hinder learning of complex patterns. Our adaptive rewiring approach, particularly when combined with early stopping, proves promising by allowing the model to adapt its connectivity structure during training.

The proposed metrics assess how synthetic data reproduces key temporal characteristics, categorized into marginal, covariance, individual-level and measurement structures. We show that strong marginal-level resemblance may conceal distortions in covariance and disruptions in individual-level trajectories. Temporal preservation is influenced by factors such as original data quality, measurement frequency, and preprocessing strategies, including binning, variable encoding and precision. Variables with sparse or highly irregular measurement times provide limited information for learning temporal dependencies, resulting in reduced resemblance between the synthetic and original data. No single metric adequately captures temporal preservation; instead, a multidimensional evaluation across all characteristics provides a more comprehensive assessment of synthetic data quality. Overall, the proposed metrics clarify how and why temporal structures are preserved or degraded, enabling more reliable evaluation and improvement of generative models and supporting the creation of temporally realistic synthetic longitudinal patient data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u8bc4\u4f30\u5408\u6210\u7eb5\u5411\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u95f4\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u8fb9\u9645\u3001\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u3001\u4e2a\u4f53\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u6784\u56db\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u591a\u7ef4\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5408\u6210\u7eb5\u5411\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u8fb9\u9645\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u4e2a\u4f53\u8f68\u8ff9\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u6027\u7684\u4fdd\u6301\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1) \u8fb9\u9645\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5206\u5e03\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff09\uff1b2) \u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u53d8\u91cf\u95f4\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff09\uff1b3) \u4e2a\u4f53\u6c34\u5e73\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u60a3\u8005\u8f68\u8ff9\u4fdd\u6301\uff09\uff1b4) \u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u5206\u5e03\uff09\u3002\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u6d4b\u91cf\u9891\u7387\u3001\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982\u5206\u7bb1\u3001\u53d8\u91cf\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff09\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u65f6\u5e8f\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1) \u5f3a\u8fb9\u9645\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u63a9\u76d6\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u626d\u66f2\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u8f68\u8ff9\u7834\u574f\uff1b2) \u7a00\u758f\u6216\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u6d4b\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u4fe1\u606f\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\uff1b3) \u6ca1\u6709\u5355\u4e00\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u5e8f\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8de8\u6240\u6709\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b4) \u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u6d4b\u91cf\u9891\u7387\u548c\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u65f6\u5e8f\u4fdd\u6301\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u65f6\u5e8f\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u5408\u6210\u7eb5\u5411\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u65f6\u5e8f\u7ed3\u6784\u5982\u4f55\u88ab\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u521b\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u65f6\u5e8f\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u3002"}}

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as the primary reward provider, leveraging their rich multimodal priors to guide alignment. However, their computation and memory cost can be substantial, and optimizing a latent diffusion generator through a pixel-space reward introduces a domain mismatch that complicates alignment. In this paper, we propose DiNa-LRM, a diffusion-native latent reward model that formulates preference learning directly on noisy diffusion states. Our method introduces a noise-calibrated Thurstone likelihood with diffusion-noise-dependent uncertainty. DiNa-LRM leverages a pretrained latent diffusion backbone with a timestep-conditioned reward head, and supports inference-time noise ensembling, providing a diffusion-native mechanism for test-time scaling and robust rewarding. Across image alignment benchmarks, DiNa-LRM substantially outperforms existing diffusion-based reward baselines and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art VLMs at a fraction of the computational cost. In preference optimization, we demonstrate that DiNa-LRM improves preference optimization dynamics, enabling faster and more resource-efficient model alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDiNa-LRM\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u6269\u6563\u566a\u58f0\u72b6\u6001\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6269\u6563\u539f\u751f\u6f5c\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86VLM\u5956\u52b1\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u548c\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u5956\u52b1\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9886\u57df\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8eVLM\u7684\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u5956\u52b1\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u9886\u57df\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u8fd9\u7ed9\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6269\u6563\u539f\u751f\u6f5c\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b(DiNa-LRM)\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6269\u6563\u72b6\u6001\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u6821\u51c6\u7684Thurstone\u4f3c\u7136\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6269\u6563\u566a\u58f0\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u914d\u5907\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u6761\u4ef6\u5956\u52b1\u5934\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u566a\u58f0\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6269\u6563\u539f\u751f\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u9f50\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDiNa-LRM\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684VLM\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4ec5\u4e3a\u540e\u8005\u7684\u4e00\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\uff1b\u5728\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\uff0cDiNa-LRM\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u66f4\u8d44\u6e90\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "conclusion": "DiNa-LRM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6269\u6563\u539f\u751f\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709VLM\u5956\u52b1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u9886\u57df\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, its performance degrades in high-dimensional problems with tightly coupled parameters and highly asymmetric objective landscapes, where rewards are sparse. In such needle-in-a-haystack scenarios, even advanced methods like trust-region BO (TurBO) often lead to unsatisfactory results. We propose a domain knowledge guided Bayesian Optimization approach, which leverages physical insight to fundamentally simplify the search problem by transforming coordinates to decouple input features and align the active subspaces with the primary search axes. We demonstrate this approach's efficacy on a challenging 12-dimensional, 6-crystal Split-and-Delay optical system, where conventional approaches, including standard BO, TuRBO and multi-objective BO, consistently led to unsatisfactory results. When combined with an reverse annealing exploration strategy, this approach reliably converges to the global optimum.

A well-known vulnerability is a backdoor introduced into a neural network by poisoned training data or a malicious training process. Backdoors can be used to induce unwanted behavior by including a certain trigger in the input. Existing mitigations filter training data, modify the model, or perform expensive input modifications on samples. If a vulnerable model has already been deployed, however, those strategies are either ineffective or inefficient. To address this gap, we propose our inference-time backdoor mitigation approach called FIRE (Feature-space Inference-time REpair). We hypothesize that a trigger induces structured and repeatable changes in the model's internal representation. We view the trigger as directions in the latent spaces between layers that can be applied in reverse to correct the inference mechanism. Therefore, we turn the backdoored model against itself by manipulating its latent representations and moving a poisoned sample's features along the backdoor directions to neutralize the trigger.

While 3D diffusion transformers attain state-of-the-art results on this task, we uncover that they exhibit a catastrophic mode of failure: arbitrarily small on-surface perturbations to the input point cloud can fracture the output into multiple disconnected pieces -- a phenomenon we call Meltdown. Using activation-patching from mechanistic interpretability, we localize Meltdown to a single early denoising cross-attention activation. We find that the singular-value spectrum of this activation provides a scalar proxy: its spectral entropy rises when fragmentation occurs and returns to baseline when patched. Interpreted through diffusion dynamics, we show that this proxy tracks a symmetry-breaking bifurcation of the reverse process. Guided by this insight, we introduce PowerRemap, a test-time control that stabilizes sparse point-cloud conditioning. We demonstrate that Meltdown persists across state-of-the-art architectures (WaLa, Make-a-Shape), datasets (GSO, SimJEB) and denoising strategies (DDPM, DDIM), and that PowerRemap effectively counters this failure with stabilization rates of up to 98.3%.

Yet, existing benchmarks predominantly assess $\\textit{Crystallized Intelligence}$, which relies on recalling accumulated knowledge and learned schemas. This focus overlooks $\\textit{Generative Fluid Intelligence (GFI)}$: the capacity to induce patterns, reason through constraints, and adapt to novel scenarios on the fly. To rigorously assess this capability, we introduce $\\textbf{GENIUS}$ ($\\textbf{GEN}$ Fluid $\\textbf{I}$ntelligence Eval$\\textbf{U}$ation $\\textbf{S}$uite). We formalize $\\textit{GFI}$ as a synthesis of three primitives. These include $\\textit{Inducing Implicit Patterns}$ (e.g., inferring personalized visual preferences), $\\textit{Executing Ad-hoc Constraints}$ (e.g., visualizing abstract metaphors), and $\\textit{Adapting to Contextual Knowledge}$ (e.g., simulating counter-intuitive physics). Collectively, these primitives challenge models to solve problems grounded entirely in the immediate context. Our systematic evaluation of 12 representative models reveals significant performance deficits in these tasks. Crucially, our diagnostic analysis disentangles these failure modes. It demonstrates that deficits stem from limited context comprehension rather than insufficient intrinsic generative capability. To bridge this gap, we propose a training-free attention intervention strategy. Ultimately, $\\textbf{GENIUS}$ establishes a rigorous standard for $\\textit{GFI}$, guiding the field beyond knowledge utilization toward dynamic, general-purpose reasoning.

For instance, in hyperparameter tuning, the validation accuracy of a model configuration (arm) typically increases with each training epoch. A defining characteristic of RMAB is em horizon-dependent optimality: unlike standard settings, the optimal strategy here shifts dramatically depending on the available budget $T$. This implies that knowledge of $T$ yields significantly greater utility in RMAB, empowering the learner to align its decision-making with this shifting optimality. However, the horizon-aware setting remains underexplored. To address this, we propose a novel CUmulative Reward Estimation UCB (CURE-UCB) that explicitly integrates the horizon. We provide a rigorous analysis establishing a new regret upper bound and prove that our method strictly outperforms horizon-agnostic strategies in structured environments like ``linear-then-flat'' instances.

We address these limitations by reframing sequence modelling through a probabilistic lens, using Bayesian filters as a core primitive. While classical filters such as Kalman filters provide principled state estimation and uncertainty tracking, they are typically viewed as inherently sequential. We show that reparameterising the Kalman filter in information form enables its updates to be computed via an associative scan, allowing efficient parallel training. Building on this insight, we introduce the Kalman Linear Attention (KLA) layer, a neural sequence-modelling primitive that performs time-parallel probabilistic inference while maintaining explicit belief-state uncertainty.

For example, the number of up-votes on social media posts, or the number of bicycles available at a public rental station. While it is possible to model these as continuous values, and to apply traditional regression, this approach changes the underlying distribution on the labels from discrete to continuous. Discrete distributions have certain benefits, which leads us to the question whether such integer labels can be modeled directly by a discrete distribution, whose parameters are predicted from the features of a given instance. Moreover, we focus on the use case of output distributions of neural networks, which adds the requirement that the parameters of the distribution be continuous so that backpropagation and gradient descent may be used to learn the weights of the network. We investigate several options for such distributions, some existing and some novel, and test them on a range of tasks, including tabular learning, sequential prediction and image generation.

This limitation prevents them from effectively capturing global periodic patterns that often span cycles significantly longer than the input horizon - despite such patterns carrying strong predictive signals. Naive solutions, such as extending the historical window, lead to severe drawbacks, including overfitting, prohibitive computational costs, and redundant information processing. To address these challenges, we introduce the Global Temporal Retriever (GTR), a lightweight and plug-and-play module designed to extend any forecasting model's temporal awareness beyond the immediate historical context. GTR maintains an adaptive global temporal embedding of the entire cycle and dynamically retrieves and aligns relevant global segments with the input sequence. By jointly modeling local and global dependencies through a 2D convolution and residual fusion, GTR effectively bridges short-term observations with long-term periodicity without altering the host model architecture. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GTR consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance across both short-term and long-term forecasting scenarios, while incurring minimal parameter and computational overhead. These results highlight GTR as an efficient and general solution for enhancing global periodicity modeling in MTSF tasks.

Whether these capabilities translate to mission-critical applications such as electricity demand forecasting--where accuracy, calibration, and robustness directly affect grid operations--remains an open question. We present a multi-dimensional benchmark evaluating four TSFMs (Chronos-Bolt, Chronos-2, Moirai-2, and TinyTimeMixer) alongside Prophet as an industry-standard baseline and two statistical references (SARIMA and Seasonal Naive), using ERCOT hourly load data from 2020 to 2024. All experiments run on consumer-grade hardware (AMD Ryzen 7, 16GB RAM, no GPU). The evaluation spans four axes: (1) context length sensitivity from 24 to 2048 hours, (2) probabilistic forecast calibration, (3) robustness under distribution shifts including COVID-19 lockdowns and Winter Storm Uri, and (4) prescriptive analytics for operational decision support. The top-performing foundation models achieve MASE values near 0.31 at long context lengths (C = 2048h, day-ahead horizon), a 47% reduction over the Seasonal Naive baseline. The inclusion of Prophet exposes a structural advantage of pre-trained models: Prophet fails when the fitting window is shorter than its seasonality period (MASE > 74 at 24-hour context), while TSFMs maintain stable accuracy even with minimal context because they recognise temporal patterns learned during pre-training rather than estimating them from scratch. Calibration varies substantially across models--Chronos-2 produces well-calibrated prediction intervals (95% empirical coverage at 90% nominal level) while both Moirai-2 and Prophet exhibit overconfidence (~70% coverage). We provide practical model selection guidelines and release the complete benchmark framework for reproducibility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7535\u529b\u9700\u6c42\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u77ed\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "motivation": "\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u5426\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7535\u529b\u9700\u6c42\u9884\u6d4b\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u4efb\u52a1\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u7535\u7f51\u8fd0\u8425\uff09\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528ERCOT 2020-2024\u5e74\u6bcf\u5c0f\u65f6\u8d1f\u8377\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u56db\u79cdTSFM\uff08Chronos-Bolt\u3001Chronos-2\u3001Moirai-2\u3001TinyTimeMixer\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5Prophet\u4f5c\u4e3a\u884c\u4e1a\u57fa\u51c6\uff0cSARIMA\u548c\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u6734\u7d20\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7edf\u8ba1\u53c2\u8003\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0824-2048\u5c0f\u65f6\uff09\u3001\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u6821\u51c6\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff08COVID-19\u5c01\u9501\u548c\u51ac\u5b63\u98ce\u66b4Uri\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd0\u8425\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7684\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\uff08C=2048h\uff0c\u65e5\u524d\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230MASE\u7ea60.31\uff0c\u6bd4\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u6734\u7d20\u57fa\u51c6\u964d\u4f4e47%\u3002Prophet\u5728\u62df\u5408\u7a97\u53e3\u77ed\u4e8e\u5176\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u5468\u671f\u65f6\u5931\u8d25\uff0824\u5c0f\u65f6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0bMASE>74\uff09\uff0c\u800cTSFM\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u6821\u51c6\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff1aChronos-2\u4ea7\u751f\u826f\u597d\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\uff0890%\u540d\u4e49\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b95%\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff09\uff0c\u800cMoirai-2\u548cProphet\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\uff08\u7ea670%\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7535\u529b\u9700\u6c42\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u77ed\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002\u5b83\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\u4f9b\u590d\u73b0\u3002"}}

Because each participant invests data and compute, clients need mechanisms to later prove the provenance of a jointly trained model. Model watermarking embeds a hidden signal in the weights, but naive approaches either do not scale with many clients as per-client watermarks dilute as $K$ grows, or give any individual client the ability to verify and potentially remove the watermark. We introduce $(t,K)$-threshold watermarking: clients collaboratively embed a shared watermark during training, while only coalitions of at least $t$ clients can reconstruct the watermark key and verify a suspect model. We secret-share the watermark key $\u03c4$ so that coalitions of fewer than $t$ clients cannot reconstruct it, and verification can be performed without revealing $\u03c4$ in the clear. We instantiate our protocol in the white-box setting and evaluate on image classification.

Text-based parsers often discard layout semantics and introduce unstructured noise, while long-horizon training typically relies on sparse outcome rewards that obscure which retrieval actions actually matter. We propose a visual-native search framework that represents webpages as visual snapshots, allowing agents to leverage layout cues to quickly localize salient evidence and suppress distractors. To learn effectively from these high-dimensional observations, we introduce Information-Aware Credit Assignment (ICA), a post-hoc method that estimates each retrieved snapshot's contribution to the final outcome via posterior analysis and propagates dense learning signals back to key search turns. Integrated with a GRPO-based training pipeline, our approach consistently outperforms text-based baselines on diverse information-seeking benchmarks, providing evidence that visual snapshot grounding with information-level credit assignment alleviates the credit-assignment bottleneck in open-ended web environments.

In practical FL systems, privacy constraints prohibit centralizing raw data, while communication efficiency introduces further challenges for distributed preprocessing.

Existing efficient architectures are theoretically bounded by shallow, single-step linear updates, while powerful iterative methods like Test-Time Training (TTT) break hardware parallelism due to state-dependent gradients. We propose PRISM (Parallel Residual Iterative Sequence Model) to resolve this tension. PRISM introduces a solver-inspired inductive bias that captures key structural properties of multi-step refinement in a parallelizable form. We employ a Write-Forget Decoupling strategy that isolates non-linearity within the injection operator. To bypass the serial dependency of explicit solvers, PRISM utilizes a two-stage proxy architecture: a short-convolution anchors the initial residual using local history energy, while a learned predictor estimates the refinement updates directly from the input.

Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) offers a straightforward way to inject domain knowledge but often degrades the model's generality. In contrast, on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) preserves generality but fails to effectively assimilate hard samples that exceed the model's current reasoning level. Recent off-policy RL attempts improve hard sample utilization, yet they suffer from severe training instability due to the forced distribution shift toward off-policy knowledge. To reconcile effective off-policy knowledge absorption with the stability of on-policy RL, we propose Rephrasing Policy Optimization (RePO). In RePO, the policy model is prompted to first comprehend off-policy knowledge and then rephrase it into trajectories that conform to its own stylistic and parametric distribution. RePO dynamically replaces low-reward rollouts with these rephrased, high-quality trajectories. This strategy guides the model toward correct reasoning paths while strictly preserving on-policy training dynamics. Experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate that RePO improves hard-sample utilization and outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "RePO\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba9\u7b56\u7565\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u5438\u6536\u786c\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5728\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50LLM\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u56f0\u5883\uff1aSFT\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u7ebfRL\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5438\u6536\u786c\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u800c\u79bb\u7b56\u7565RL\u5b58\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5438\u6536\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u77e5\u8bc6\u53c8\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u5728\u7ebfRL\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRephrasing Policy Optimization (RePO)\uff1a\u8ba9\u7b56\u7565\u6a21\u578b\u9996\u5148\u7406\u89e3\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u5176\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u7b26\u5408\u81ea\u8eab\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8f68\u8ff9\u66ff\u6362\u4f4e\u5956\u52b1\u7684rollouts\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u8d70\u5411\u6b63\u786e\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e25\u683c\u4fdd\u6301\u5728\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cRePO\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u786c\u6837\u672c\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "RePO\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50LLM\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u5438\u6536\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Various methods address this issue by optimizing a weighted objective that focuses on the worst-performing groups. However, this approach becomes problematic when learning with differential privacy, as unequal data weighting can result in inhomogeneous privacy guarantees, in particular weaker privacy for minority groups. In this work, we introduce a new algorithm for differentially private worst-case group optimization called ASC (Adaptively Sampled and Clipped Worst-case Group Optimization). It adaptively controls both the sampling rate and the clipping threshold of each group. Thereby, it allows for harder-to-learn groups to be sampled more often while ensuring consistent privacy guarantees across all groups.

We evaluated 10 contemporary LLMs and found that even the strongest model achieves only a 21.5% pass rate, demonstrating the difficulty of the task. Finally, we introduce a reinforcement learning pipeline with visual rewards that uses a vision-language model as a judge to train textual models. Experiments show that training with our data improves physical simulation via code while substantially enhancing general code generation performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "SimuScene\uff1a\u9996\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76LLMs\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u7801\u6a21\u62df\u7269\u7406\u573a\u666f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b7,659\u4e2a\u7269\u7406\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u4ec521.5%\u901a\u8fc7\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1LLMs\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u7ade\u8d5b\u3001\u590d\u6742\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5df2\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u7801\u51c6\u786e\u8868\u793a\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u7269\u7406\u573a\u666f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9LLMs\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "1) \u6784\u5efaSimuScene\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u7ba1\u9053\u6536\u96c6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u786e\u4fdd\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u6db5\u76d65\u4e2a\u7269\u7406\u9886\u57df\u548c52\u4e2a\u7269\u7406\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5305\u542b7,659\u4e2a\u7269\u7406\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d334\u4e2a\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4eba\u5de5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\uff1b2) \u8bc4\u4f3010\u4e2a\u5f53\u4ee3LLMs\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u80fd\u529b\uff1b3) \u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7ba1\u9053\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u5956\u52b1\u8bad\u7ec3\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "1) \u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5f3aLLM\u5728\u7269\u7406\u573a\u666f\u6a21\u62df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4ec5\u8fbe\u523021.5%\u7684\u901a\u8fc7\u7387\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528SimuScene\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u80fd\u529b\uff1b3) \u8bad\u7ec3\u8fd8\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "SimuScene\u586b\u8865\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u7269\u7406\u573a\u666f\u6a21\u62df\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b64\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3aLLMs\u5728\u7269\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Unlike pixel grids in images or sequential structures in language, graphs exhibit a typical non-Euclidean structure with complex interactions among the objects. This paper argues that Riemannian geometry provides a principled and necessary foundation for graph representation learning, and that Riemannian graph learning should be viewed as a unifying paradigm rather than a collection of isolated techniques. While recent studies have explored the integration of graph learning and Riemannian geometry, most existing approaches are limited to a narrow class of manifolds, particularly hyperbolic spaces, and often adopt extrinsic manifold formulations. We contend that the central mission of Riemannian graph learning is to endow graph neural networks with intrinsic manifold structures, which remains underexplored. To advance this perspective, we identify key conceptual and methodological gaps in existing approaches and outline a structured research agenda along three dimensions: manifold type, neural architecture, and learning paradigm. We further discuss open challenges, theoretical foundations, and promising directions that are critical for unlocking the full potential of Riemannian graph learning.

In many real-world domains, online learning in the environment can be risky, and specifying accurate safety costs can be difficult. However, it is often feasible to collect trajectories that reflect undesirable or unsafe behavior, implicitly conveying what the agent should avoid. We refer to these as non-preferred trajectories. We propose a novel offline safe IL algorithm, OSIL, that infers safety from non-preferred demonstrations. We formulate safe policy learning as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). Instead of relying on explicit safety cost and reward annotations, OSIL reformulates the CMDP problem by deriving a lower bound on reward maximizing objective and learning a cost model that estimates the likelihood of non-preferred behavior. Our approach allows agents to learn safe and reward-maximizing behavior entirely from offline demonstrations. We empirically demonstrate that our approach can learn safer policies that satisfy cost constraints without degrading the reward performance, thus outperforming several baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faOSIL\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u65e0\u5b89\u5168\u6210\u672c\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u6f14\u793a\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u975e\u504f\u597d\u8f68\u8ff9\u63a8\u65ad\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u5b58\u5728\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u6307\u5b9a\u5b89\u5168\u6210\u672c\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4f46\u6536\u96c6\u53cd\u6620\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u76f8\u5bf9\u5bb9\u6613", "method": "\u5c06\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ece\u975e\u504f\u597d\u6f14\u793a\u63a8\u5bfc\u5956\u52b1\u6700\u5927\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u4f30\u8ba1\u975e\u504f\u597d\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u7684\u6210\u672c\u6a21\u578b", "result": "OSIL\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u6ee1\u8db3\u6210\u672c\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u800c\u4e0d\u964d\u4f4e\u5956\u52b1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b89\u5168\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4ece\u65e0\u6807\u6ce8\u6f14\u793a\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848"}}

A practical alternative to reduce computational and memory overhead is to perform BPTT repeatedly over shorter segments of the training data set, corresponding to truncated BPTT. In this paper, we examine the training of RNNs when using such a truncated learning approach for time series tasks. Specifically, we establish theoretical bounds on the accuracy and performance loss when optimizing over subsequences instead of the full data sequence. This reveals that the burn-in phase of the RNN is an important tuning knob in its training, with significant impact on the performance guarantees. We validate our theoretical results through experiments on standard benchmarks from the fields of system identification and time series forecasting. In all experiments, we observe a strong influence of the burn-in phase on the training process, and proper tuning can lead to a reduction of the prediction error on the training and test data of more than 60% in some cases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u622a\u65adBPTT\u8bad\u7ec3RNN\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u5b50\u5e8f\u5217\u800c\u975e\u5b8c\u6574\u6570\u636e\u5e8f\u5217\u65f6\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u7406\u8bba\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0RNN\u7684\u9884\u70ed\u9636\u6bb5\u662f\u91cd\u8981\u8c03\u8282\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6BPTT\u8bad\u7ec3RNN\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u8f93\u5165\u5e8f\u5217\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u622a\u65adBPTT\u901a\u8fc7\u5904\u7406\u8f83\u77ed\u6570\u636e\u6bb5\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u622a\u65ad\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4f18\u5316\u5b50\u5e8f\u5217\u800c\u975e\u5b8c\u6574\u5e8f\u5217\u65f6\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8RNN\u9884\u70ed\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9884\u70ed\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u9002\u5f53\u8c03\u8282\u9884\u70ed\u9636\u6bb5\u53ef\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e60%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u622a\u65adBPTT\u662f\u8bad\u7ec3RNN\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9884\u70ed\u9636\u6bb5\u662f\u5173\u952e\u8c03\u8282\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u9002\u5f53\u914d\u7f6e\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684RNN\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

Existing primal-dual methods that achieve sublinear strong reward regret inevitably incur growing strong constraint violation or are restricted to average-iterate convergence due to inherent oscillations. To address these limitations, we propose the Flexible safety Domain Optimization via Margin-regularized Exploration (FlexDOME) algorithm, the first to provably achieve near-constant $\\tilde{O}(1)$ strong constraint violation alongside sublinear strong regret and non-asymptotic last-iterate convergence. FlexDOME incorporates time-varying safety margins and regularization terms into the primal-dual framework. Our theoretical analysis relies on a novel term-wise asymptotic dominance strategy, where the safety margin is rigorously scheduled to asymptotically majorize the functional decay rates of the optimization and statistical errors, thereby clamping cumulative violations to a near-constant level.

This study presents the spatial-morphological (SM) imputer tool, which combines data-driven morphological clustering with neighborhood-based methods to reconstruct missing values of the floor space index (FSI) and ground space index (GSI) at the city block level, inspired by the SpaceMatrix framework. This approach combines city-scale morphological patterns as global priors with local spatial information for context-dependent interpolation. The evaluation shows that while SM alone captures meaningful morphological structure, its combination with inverse distance weighting (IDW) or spatial k-nearest neighbor (sKNN) methods provides superior performance compared to existing SOTA models. Composite methods demonstrate the complementary advantages of combining morphological and spatial approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSM\u586b\u8865\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f62\u6001\u805a\u7c7b\u4e0e\u90bb\u57df\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91cd\u5efa\u57ce\u5e02\u8857\u533a\u5c42\u9762\u7684FSI\u548cGSI\u7f3a\u5931\u503c\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u6a21\u578b", "motivation": "\u57ce\u5e02\u5f62\u6001\u6307\u6807\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u91cd\u5efa\u5bf9\u57ce\u5e02\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u586b\u8865\u8857\u533a\u5c42\u9762\u7684FSI\u548cGSI\u7f3a\u5931\u503c", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f62\u6001\u586b\u8865\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u805a\u7c7b\uff08\u5168\u5c40\u5148\u9a8c\uff09\u4e0e\u90bb\u57df\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5c40\u90e8\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9006\u8ddd\u79bb\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4k\u8fd1\u90bb\u8fdb\u884c\u63d2\u503c", "result": "SM\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0eIDW\u6216sKNN\u7ed3\u5408\u540e\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u590d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f62\u6001\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u4f18\u52bf", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5f62\u6001\u805a\u7c7b\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u90bb\u57df\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u590d\u5408\u586b\u8865\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u91cd\u5efa\u57ce\u5e02\u5f62\u6001\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4e3a\u57ce\u5e02\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u5de5\u5177"}}

However, controlling the composition of multiple pre-trained models remains an open challenge. Current approaches largely treat composition as an algebraic composition of probability densities, such as via products or mixtures of experts. This perspective assumes the target distribution is known explicitly, which is almost never the case. In this work, we propose a different paradigm that formulates compositional generation as a cooperative Stochastic Optimal Control problem. Rather than combining probability densities, we treat pre-trained diffusion models as interacting agents whose diffusion trajectories are jointly steered, via optimal control, toward a shared objective defined on their aggregated output. We validate our framework on conditional MNIST generation and compare it against a naive inference-time DPS-style baseline replacing learned cooperative control with per-step gradient guidance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u7ec4\u5408\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5408\u4f5c\u968f\u673a\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u89c6\u4e3a\u4ea4\u4e92\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u8054\u5408\u5f15\u5bfc\u5176\u6269\u6563\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5171\u4eab\u76ee\u6807", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u548c\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u63a7\u5236\u591a\u4e2a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5c06\u7ec4\u5408\u89c6\u4e3a\u6982\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u4ee3\u6570\u7ec4\u5408\uff08\u5982\u4e58\u79ef\u6216\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u9700\u8981\u660e\u786e\u77e5\u9053\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u60c5\u51b5\u51e0\u4e4e\u4ece\u4e0d\u5982\u6b64\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u5c06\u7ec4\u5408\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5408\u4f5c\u968f\u673a\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e0d\u7ec4\u5408\u6982\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u89c6\u4e3a\u4ea4\u4e92\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u8054\u5408\u5f15\u5bfc\u5176\u6269\u6563\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u805a\u5408\u8f93\u51fa\u6ee1\u8db3\u5171\u4eab\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6761\u4ef6MNIST\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6DPS\u98ce\u683c\u57fa\u7ebf\uff08\u7528\u6bcf\u6b65\u68af\u5ea6\u6307\u5bfc\u66ff\u4ee3\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u63a7\u5236\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7ec4\u5408\u751f\u6210\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u5408\u4f5c\u968f\u673a\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u663e\u5f0f\u6982\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u534f\u8c03\u591a\u4e2a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

By computing activation-difference vectors for both test prompts and preference pairs and ranking by cosine similarity, we identify datapoints that cause specific behaviors and validate these attributions causally by retraining with modified data. Clustering behavior-datapoint similarity matrices also enables unsupervised discovery of emergent behaviors. Applying this to OLMo 2's production DPO training, we surfaced distractor-triggered compliance: a harmful behavior where the model complies with dangerous requests when benign formatting instructions are appended.

Existing KE methods are largely designed for dense architectures, limiting their applicability to the increasingly prevalent sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models that underpin modern scalable LLMs. Although MoEs offer strong efficiency and capacity scaling, naively adapting dense-model editors is both computationally costly and prone to routing distribution shifts that undermine stability and consistency. To address these challenges, we introduce MoEEdit, the first routing-stable framework for parameter-modifying knowledge editing in MoE LLMs. Our method reparameterizes expert updates via per-expert null-space projections that keep router inputs invariant and thereby suppress routing shifts. The resulting block-structured optimization is solved efficiently with a block coordinate descent (BCD) solver. Experiments show that MoEEdit attains state-of-the-art efficacy and generalization while preserving high specificity and routing stability, with superior compute and memory efficiency. These results establish a robust foundation for scalable, precise knowledge editing in sparse LLMs and underscore the importance of routing-stable interventions.", "AI": {"tldr": "MoEEdit\uff1a\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u7a00\u758fMoE\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8def\u7531\u7a33\u5b9a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u5bb6\u7a7a\u7a7a\u95f4\u6295\u5f71\u4fdd\u6301\u8def\u7531\u8f93\u5165\u4e0d\u53d8\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728MoE\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u8def\u7531\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u5bc6\u96c6\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65e5\u76ca\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u7a00\u758fMoE\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u76f4\u63a5\u9002\u914d\u5bc6\u96c6\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u5668\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u5bb9\u6613\u5f15\u53d1\u8def\u7531\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u7834\u574f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMoEEdit\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u7a7a\u7a7a\u95f4\u6295\u5f71\u91cd\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e13\u5bb6\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u8def\u7531\u5668\u8f93\u5165\u4e0d\u53d8\u4ece\u800c\u6291\u5236\u8def\u7531\u504f\u79fb\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u5757\u5750\u6807\u4e0b\u964d\uff08BCD\uff09\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5757\u7ed3\u6784\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eMoEEdit\u5728\u6548\u679c\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u548c\u8def\u7531\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u7a00\u758fLLM\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u8def\u7531\u7a33\u5b9a\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

We propose HCW-GLB-OMD, which consists of two components: an online mirror descent (OMD)-based estimator and Hessian-based confidence weights to achieve corruption robustness. This is computationally efficient in that it only requires ${O}(1)$ space and time complexity per iteration. Under the self-concordance assumption on the link function, we show a regret bound of $\\tilde{O}\\left( d \\sqrt{\\sum_t g(\u03c4_t) \\dot\u03bc_{t,\\star}} + d^2 g_{\\max} \u03ba+ d \u03baC \\right)$, where $\\dot\u03bc_{t,\\star}$ is the slope of $\u03bc$ around the optimal arm at time $t$, $g(\u03c4_t)$'s are potentially exogenously time-varying dispersions (e.g., $g(\u03c4_t) = \u03c3_t^2$ for heteroskedastic linear bandits, $g(\u03c4_t) = 1$ for Bernoulli and Poisson), $g_{\\max} = \\max_{t \\in [T]} g(\u03c4_t)$ is the maximum dispersion, and $C \\geq 0$ is the total corruption budget of the adversary. We complement this with a lower bound of $\\tilde\u03a9(d \\sqrt{\\sum_t g(\u03c4_t) \\dot\u03bc_{t,\\star}} + d C)$, unifying previous problem-specific lower bounds. Thus, our algorithm achieves, up to a $\u03ba$-factor in the corruption term, instance-wise minimax optimality simultaneously across various instances of heteroskedastic GLBs with adversarial corruptions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faHCW-GLB-OMD\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u5177\u6709\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u5f02\u65b9\u5dee\u5e7f\u4e49\u7ebf\u6027\u8001\u864e\u673a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u6781\u5c0f\u6781\u5927\u6700\u4f18\u6027", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5f02\u65b9\u5dee\u5e7f\u4e49\u7ebf\u6027\u8001\u864e\u673a\uff08\u5305\u542b\u5f02\u65b9\u5dee\u7ebf\u6027\u8001\u864e\u673a\u3001\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52/\u6cca\u677e\u8001\u864e\u673a\u7b49\uff09\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65e2\u80fd\u62b5\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u53c8\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHCW-GLB-OMD\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5728\u7ebf\u955c\u50cf\u4e0b\u964d\uff08OMD\uff09\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eHessian\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u7b97\u6cd5\u6bcf\u8f6e\u4ec5\u9700O(1)\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6", "result": "\u5728\u94fe\u63a5\u51fd\u6570\u6ee1\u8db3\u81ea\u534f\u8c03\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u540e\u6094\u754c$\\tilde{O}\\left( d \\sqrt{\\sum_t g(\u03c4_t) \\dot\u03bc_{t,\\star}} + d^2 g_{\\max} \u03ba+ d \u03baC \\right)$\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u5339\u914d\u7684\u4e0b\u754c$\\tilde\u03a9(d \\sqrt{\\sum_t g(\u03c4_t) \\dot\u03bc_{t,\\star}} + d C)$\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6270\u52a8\u9879\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u03ba\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u6781\u5c0f\u6781\u5927\u6700\u4f18\u6027", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u5f02\u65b9\u5dee\u5e7f\u4e49\u7ebf\u6027\u8001\u864e\u673a\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u79cd\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u4f8b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

However, practical offline datasets often contain examples with little diversity or limited exploration of the environment, and from multiple behavior policies with diverse expertise levels. Limited exploration can impair the offline RL algorithm's ability to estimate \\textit{Q} or \\textit{V} values, while constraining towards diverse behavior policies can be overly conservative. Such datasets call for a balance between the RL objective and behavior policy constraints. We first identify the connection between $f$-divergence and optimization constraint on the Bellman residual through a more general Linear Programming form for RL and the convex conjugate. Following this, we introduce the general flexible function formulation for the $f$-divergence to incorporate an adaptive constraint on algorithms' learning objectives based on the offline training dataset. Results from experiments on the MuJoCo, Fetch, and AdroitHand environments show the correctness of the proposed LP form and the potential of the flexible $f$-divergence in improving performance for learning from a challenging dataset when applied to a compatible constrained optimization algorithm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8ef-\u6563\u5ea6\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ea6\u675f\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u5f62\u5f0f\u548c\u51f8\u5171\u8f6d\u8fde\u63a5f-\u6563\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8d1d\u5c14\u66fc\u6b8b\u5dee\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5728MuJoCo\u7b49\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u901a\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u63a2\u7d22\u6709\u9650\u3001\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0d\u4e00\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6709\u9650\u63a2\u7d22\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cdQ/V\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u800c\u5411\u591a\u6837\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u7ea6\u675f\u53c8\u53ef\u80fd\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4fdd\u5b88\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728RL\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u7ea6\u675f\u4e4b\u95f4\u627e\u5230\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u5f62\u5f0f\u548c\u51f8\u5171\u8f6d\u5efa\u7acbf-\u6563\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8d1d\u5c14\u66fc\u6b8b\u5dee\u4f18\u5316\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5f15\u5165f-\u6563\u5ea6\u7684\u901a\u7528\u7075\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5bf9\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u65bd\u52a0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5728MuJoCo\u3001Fetch\u548cAdroitHand\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u5f62\u5f0f\u6b63\u786e\uff0c\u7075\u6d3b\u7684f-\u6563\u5ea6\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4ece\u6311\u6218\u6027\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u63a5f-\u6563\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8d1d\u5c14\u66fc\u6b8b\u5dee\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ea6\u675f\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5e73\u8861\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u4e2d\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4f46\u63a2\u7d22\u6709\u9650\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Existing approaches obtain uncertainty through ensemble replication, fixed stochastic noise such as dropout, or post hoc calibration. Cross-regularized uncertainty learns uncertainty parameters during training using gradients routed through a held-out regularization split. The predictor is optimized on the training split for fit, while low-dimensional uncertainty controls are optimized on the regularization split to reduce train-test mismatch, yielding regime-adaptive uncertainty without per-regime noise tuning. The framework can learn continuous noise levels at the output head, within hidden features, or within operator-specific components such as spectral modes. We instantiate the approach in Fourier Neural Operators and evaluate on APEBench sweeps over observed fraction and training-set size. Across these sweeps, the learned predictive distributions are better calibrated on held-out splits and the resulting uncertainty fields concentrate in high-error regions in one-step spatial diagnostics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCross-regularized uncertainty\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5206\u5272\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u4f53\u5236\u8c03\u6574\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edcPDE\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6821\u51c6\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u795e\u7ecfPDE\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u6216\u90e8\u5206\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u4e0b\u6e38\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9700\u8981\u4f4e\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u8fd8\u9700\u8981\u6821\u51c6\u826f\u597d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u590d\u5236\u3001\u56fa\u5b9a\u968f\u673a\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u4e8b\u540e\u6821\u51c6\u83b7\u5f97\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u591f\u7075\u6d3b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCross-regularized uncertainty\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5206\u5272\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5272\u4e0a\u4f18\u5316\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u800c\u4f4e\u7ef4\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u5728\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5206\u5272\u4e0a\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3-\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f53\u5236\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4f53\u5236\u8c03\u6574\u566a\u58f0\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u8f93\u51fa\u5934\u3001\u9690\u85cf\u7279\u5f81\u6216\u7b97\u5b50\u7279\u5b9a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u8c31\u6a21\u5f0f\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "result": "\u5728Fourier Neural Operators\u4e0a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728APEBench\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c2\u6d4b\u6bd4\u4f8b\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u626b\u63cf\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u626b\u63cf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u5206\u5272\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u573a\u5728\u4e00\u9636\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u9ad8\u8bef\u5dee\u533a\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "Cross-regularized uncertainty\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u4f53\u5236\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u4f53\u5236\u8c03\u6574\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5728PDE\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bef\u5dee\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

While many tool invocations repeat across parallel rollouts and could in principle be cached, naively caching their outputs for reuse is incorrect since tool outputs depend on the environment state induced by prior agent interactions. We present TVCACHE, a stateful tool-value cache for LLM agent post-training. TVCACHE maintains a tree of observed tool-call sequences and performs longest-prefix matching for cache lookups: a hit occurs only when the agent's full tool history matches a previously executed sequence, guaranteeing identical environment state. On three diverse workloads-terminal-based tasks, SQL generation, and video understanding. TVCACHE achieves cache hit rates of up to 70% and reduces median tool call execution time by up to 6.9X, with no degradation in post-training reward accumulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "TVCACHE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8eLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u5de5\u5177\u503c\u7f13\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u957f\u524d\u7f00\u5339\u914d\u786e\u4fdd\u7f13\u5b58\u547d\u4e2d\u65f6\u73af\u5883\u72b6\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0c\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u8017\u65f6\u6570\u79d2\u751a\u81f3\u6570\u5206\u949f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4GPU\u7a7a\u95f2\u5e76\u589e\u52a0\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6210\u672c\u3002\u867d\u7136\u8bb8\u591a\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u5728\u5e76\u884crollout\u4e2d\u91cd\u590d\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u7b80\u5355\u7f13\u5b58\u8f93\u51fa\u662f\u9519\u8bef\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5de5\u5177\u8f93\u51fa\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u73af\u5883\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "method": "TVCACHE\u7ef4\u62a4\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u5e8f\u5217\u6811\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u6700\u957f\u524d\u7f00\u5339\u914d\u8fdb\u884c\u7f13\u5b58\u67e5\u627e\uff1a\u53ea\u6709\u5f53\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u5de5\u5177\u5386\u53f2\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u6267\u884c\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u5339\u914d\u65f6\u624d\u4f1a\u547d\u4e2d\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u73af\u5883\u72b6\u6001\u76f8\u540c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff08\u7ec8\u7aef\u4efb\u52a1\u3001SQL\u751f\u6210\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\uff09\u4e0a\uff0cTVCACHE\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe70%\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u547d\u4e2d\u7387\uff0c\u5c06\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u8fbe6.9\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5956\u52b1\u79ef\u7d2f\u65e0\u9000\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "TVCACHE\u901a\u8fc7\u72b6\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u800c\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

On Shanghai Gold Exchange (SGE) spot gold data (2005-2025), we construct two window-aligned views from each rolling window: an OHLCV-rendered price/volume chart and a technical-indicator matrix. To ensure reliable evaluation, we adopt leakage-resistant time-block splits with embargo and use Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). We find that results depend strongly on the label-noise regime: we apply an ex-post minimum-movement filter that discards samples with realized next-day absolute return below tau to define evaluation subsets with reduced near-zero label ambiguity. This induces a non-monotonic data-noise trade-off that can reveal predictive signal but eventually increases variance as sample size shrinks; the filter is used for offline benchmark construction rather than an inference-time decision rule. In the stabilized subsets, fusion is regime dependent: early fusion by channel stacking can exhibit negative transfer, whereas late fusion with dual encoders and a fusion head provides the dominant clean-performance gains; cross-view consistency regularization has secondary, backbone-dependent effects. We further evaluate test-time L-infinity perturbations using FGSM and PGD under two threat scenarios: view-constrained attacks that perturb one view and joint attacks that perturb both. We observe severe vulnerability at tiny budgets with strong view asymmetry. Late fusion consistently improves robustness under view-constrained attacks, but joint attacks remain challenging and can still cause substantial worst-case degradation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u91d1\u878d\u56fe\u50cf\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u540c\u6e90\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6b21\u65e5\u65b9\u5411\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u7ed3\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540e\u9a8c\u6700\u5c0f\u53d8\u52a8\u8fc7\u6ee4\u53ef\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u6807\u7b7e\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u3002\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6548\u679c\u56e0\u673a\u5236\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u665a\u671f\u878d\u5408\u5728\u6e05\u6d01\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5fae\u5c0f\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u63a2\u7d22\u91d1\u878d\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0a\u6d77\u9ec4\u91d1\u4ea4\u6613\u6240\u73b0\u8d27\u9ec4\u91d1\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6b21\u65e5\u65b9\u5411\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1) \u4ece\u6eda\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u6784\u5efa\u4e24\u4e2a\u5bf9\u9f50\u89c6\u56fe\uff1aOHLCV\u6e32\u67d3\u7684\u4ef7\u683c/\u6210\u4ea4\u91cf\u56fe\u8868\u548c\u6280\u672f\u6307\u6807\u77e9\u9635\uff1b2) \u91c7\u7528\u9632\u6cc4\u6f0f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5757\u5206\u5272\u548cMatthews\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b3) \u5e94\u7528\u540e\u9a8c\u6700\u5c0f\u53d8\u52a8\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6765\u5b9a\u4e49\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b50\u96c6\uff1b4) \u6bd4\u8f83\u65e9\u671f\u878d\u5408\uff08\u901a\u9053\u5806\u53e0\uff09\u548c\u665a\u671f\u878d\u5408\uff08\u53cc\u7f16\u7801\u5668+\u878d\u5408\u5934\uff09\uff1b5) \u4f7f\u7528FGSM\u548cPGD\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u89c6\u56fe\u7ea6\u675f\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u8054\u5408\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff1a1) \u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u5f3a\u70c8\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u673a\u5236\uff1b2) \u6700\u5c0f\u53d8\u52a8\u8fc7\u6ee4\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f46\u6700\u7ec8\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u65b9\u5dee\uff1b3) \u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b50\u96c6\u4e2d\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u878d\u5408\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u800c\u665a\u671f\u878d\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u6e05\u6d01\u6027\u80fd\u589e\u76ca\uff1b4) \u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5fae\u5c0f\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u665a\u671f\u878d\u5408\u5728\u89c6\u56fe\u7ea6\u675f\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u8054\u5408\u653b\u51fb\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\uff1a\u91d1\u878d\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u9700\u8981\u4ed4\u7ec6\u8003\u8651\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u673a\u5236\u548c\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u665a\u671f\u878d\u5408\u5728\u6e05\u6d01\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u89c6\u56fe\u7ea6\u675f\u653b\u51fb\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u6297\u8054\u5408\u653b\u51fb\u4ecd\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u6700\u5c0f\u53d8\u52a8\u8fc7\u6ee4\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u57fa\u51c6\u6784\u5efa\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u51b3\u7b56\u89c4\u5219\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present Pram, the first ML-based method that leverages the reasoning power of multimodal language models (MLMs) for addressing the trade-off dilemma -- a great need of service providers. As part of our proposal, Pram (i) quickly computes high-quality allocations by dividing the original problem into local subproblems, which are then resolved by an MLM-powered \"agent\", and (ii) ensures global consistency by harmonizing these subproblems via a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm. Theoretically, we show that Pram, which learns to perform gradient descent in context, provably converges to the optimum within the family of MCF problems. Empirically, on real-world datasets and public topologies, Pram achieves performance comparable to, and in some cases even surpassing, linear programming solvers (very close to the optimal solution), and substantially lower runtimes (1 to 2 orders of magnitude faster). Moreover, Pram exhibits strong robustness (<10\\% performance degradation under link failures or flow bursts), demonstrating MLM's generalization ability to unforeseen events. Pram is objective-agnostic and seamlessly integrates with mainstream allocation systems, providing a practical and scalable solution for future networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Pram\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684ML\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u5546\u54c1\u6d41\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u539f\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5c40\u90e8\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u7531MLM\u4ee3\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u786e\u4fdd\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5206\u914d\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u4f18\u5316\u5f15\u64ce\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u79cd\u6743\u8861\u56f0\u5883\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "Pram\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u591a\u5546\u54c1\u6d41\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5c40\u90e8\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7531\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\"\u4ee3\u7406\"\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u534f\u8c03\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u516c\u5171\u62d3\u6251\u4e0a\uff0cPram\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u975e\u5e38\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff09\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e1-2\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u94fe\u8def\u6545\u969c\u6216\u6d41\u91cf\u7a81\u53d1\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff08\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d<10%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "Pram\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u4e0e\u4e3b\u6d41\u5206\u914d\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We study this problem in full-body human motion, where large-scale data collection is infeasible but essential for wearable-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR), and where synthetic motion can be generated from motion-capture-derived representations. We pretrain motion time-series models using such synthetic data and evaluate their transfer across diverse downstream HAR tasks. Our results show that synthetic pretraining improves generalisation when mixed with real data or scaled sufficiently. We also demonstrate that large-scale motion-capture pretraining yields only marginal gains due to domain mismatch with wearable signals, clarifying key sim-to-real challenges and the limits and opportunities of synthetic motion data for transferable HAR representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5728\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5408\u6210\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u6216\u8db3\u591f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u65f6\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8fd0\u52a8\u6355\u6349\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u56e0\u9886\u57df\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u800c\u6536\u76ca\u6709\u9650", "motivation": "\u5f53\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u65f6\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5168\u8eab\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u4f46\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4ece\u8fd0\u52a8\u6355\u6349\u884d\u751f\u8868\u793a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5408\u6210\u8fd0\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fd0\u52a8\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38HAR\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b", "result": "\u5408\u6210\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u6216\u89c4\u6a21\u8db3\u591f\u5927\u65f6\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8fd0\u52a8\u6355\u6349\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7531\u4e8e\u4e0e\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u4fe1\u53f7\u5b58\u5728\u9886\u57df\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u4ec5\u5e26\u6765\u8fb9\u9645\u6536\u76ca", "conclusion": "\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u4ece\u6a21\u62df\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5408\u6210\u8fd0\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u5728\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fbHAR\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u548c\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u4e3a\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u89c1\u89e3"}}

Existing methods are either too expensive for deployment at scale, or require initial white-box access to model weights or grey-box access to log probabilities. We aim to achieve both low cost and strict black-box operation, observing only output tokens.\n  Our approach hinges on specific inputs we call Border Inputs, for which there exists more than one output top token. From a statistical perspective, optimal change detection depends on the model's Jacobian and the Fisher information of the output distribution. Analyzing these quantities in low-temperature regimes shows that border inputs enable powerful change detection tests.\n  Building on this insight, we propose the Black-Box Border Input Tracking (B3IT) scheme. Extensive in-vivo and in-vitro experiments show that border inputs are easily found for non-reasoning tested endpoints, and achieve performance on par with the best available grey-box approaches.

MerLin integrates optimized strong simulation of linear optical circuits into standard PyTorch and scikit learn workflows, enabling end to end differentiable training of quantum layers. MerLin is designed around systematic benchmarking and reproducibility. As an initial contribution, we reproduce eighteen state of the art photonic and hybrid QML works spanning kernel methods, reservoir computing, convolutional and recurrent architectures, generative models, and modern training paradigms. These reproductions are released as reusable, modular experiments that can be directly extended and adapted, establishing a shared experimental baseline consistent with empirical benchmarking methodologies widely adopted in modern artificial intelligence. By embedding photonic quantum models within established machine learning ecosystems, MerLin allows practitioners to leverage existing tooling for ablation studies, cross modality comparisons, and hybrid classical quantum workflows.

Barajas-Solano"], "title": "Statistical Learning Analysis of Physics-Informed Neural Networks", "comment": null, "summary": "We study the training and performance of physics-informed learning for initial and boundary value problems (IBVP) with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) from a statistical learning perspective. Specifically, we restrict ourselves to parameterizations with hard initial and boundary condition constraints and reformulate the problem of estimating PINN parameters as a statistical learning problem. From this perspective, the physics penalty on the IBVP residuals can be better understood not as a regularizing term bus as an infinite source of indirect data, and the learning process as fitting the PINN distribution of residuals $p(y \\mid x, t, w) q(x, t) $ to the true data-generating distribution $\u03b4(0) q(x, t)$ by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true and PINN distributions. Furthermore, this analysis show that physics-informed learning with PINNs is a singular learning problem, and we employ singular learning theory tools, namely the so-called Local Learning Coefficient (Lau et al., 2025) to analyze the estimates of PINN parameters obtained via stochastic optimization for a heat equation IBVP. Finally, we discuss implications of this analysis on the quantification of predictive uncertainty of PINNs and the extrapolation capacity of PINNs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4ece\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u89d2\u5206\u6790PINNs\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u89c6\u4e3a\u65e0\u9650\u95f4\u63a5\u6570\u636e\u6e90\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5947\u5f02\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u6570\u5206\u6790\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bbaPINNs\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5916\u63a8\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u91cd\u65b0\u7406\u89e3\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08PINNs\uff09\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u521d\u8fb9\u503c\u95ee\u9898\uff08IBVP\uff09\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u89c6\u4e3a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9879\uff0c\u4f46\u672c\u6587\u5e0c\u671b\u4ece\u66f4\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5206\u6790PINNs\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u3002", "method": "1. \u91c7\u7528\u786c\u521d\u59cb\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b2. \u5c06PINNs\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff1b3. \u5c06\u7269\u7406\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\u7406\u89e3\u4e3a\u65e0\u9650\u95f4\u63a5\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u800c\u975e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9879\uff1b4. \u4f7f\u7528\u5947\u5f02\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5c40\u90e8\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u6570\uff08Local Learning Coefficient\uff09\uff1b5. \u4ee5\u70ed\u65b9\u7a0bIBVP\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316\u83b7\u5f97\u7684PINN\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "1. \u8bc1\u660e\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684PINNs\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5947\u5f02\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff1b2. \u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316PINN\u6b8b\u5dee\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5206\u5e03\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684KL\u6563\u5ea6\u6765\u62df\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff1b3. \u4f7f\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u6570\u5206\u6790PINN\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b4. \u4e3a\u7406\u89e3PINNs\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5916\u63a8\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ece\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u89d2\u4e3aPINNs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u65e0\u9650\u95f4\u63a5\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u800c\u975e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9879\u3002\u8be5\u5206\u6790\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3PINNs\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u5916\u63a8\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Here we introduce the Materials Knowledge Navigation Agent (MKNA), a language-driven system that translates natural-language scientific intent into executable actions for database retrieval, property prediction, structure generation, and stability evaluation. Beyond automating tool invocation, MKNA autonomously extracts quantitative thresholds and chemically meaningful design motifs from literature and database evidence, enabling data-grounded hypothesis formation. Applied to the search for high-Debye-temperature ceramics, the agent identifies a literature-supported screening criterion (Theta_D > 800 K), rediscovers canonical ultra-stiff materials such as diamond, SiC, SiN, and BeO, and proposes thermodynamically stable, previously unreported Be-C-rich compounds that populate the sparsely explored 1500-1700 K regime. These results demonstrate that MKNA not only finds stable candidates but also reconstructs interpretable design heuristics, establishing a generalizable platform for autonomous, language-guided materials exploration.", "AI": {"tldr": "MKNA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bed\u8a00\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6750\u6599\u53d1\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u79d1\u5b66\u610f\u56fe\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5728\u5bfb\u627e\u9ad8\u5fb7\u62dc\u6e29\u5ea6\u9676\u74f7\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6210\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6750\u6599\u53d1\u73b0\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6\u76f4\u89c9\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6750\u6599\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u901f\u5ea6\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6750\u6599\u63a2\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u6750\u6599\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bfc\u822a\u4ee3\u7406\uff08MKNA\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bed\u8a00\u9a71\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u79d1\u5b66\u610f\u56fe\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ece\u6587\u732e\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u8bc1\u636e\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5b9a\u91cf\u9608\u503c\u548c\u5316\u5b66\u4e0a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5bfb\u627e\u9ad8\u5fb7\u62dc\u6e29\u5ea6\u9676\u74f7\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0cMKNA\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u6587\u732e\u652f\u6301\u7684\u7b5b\u9009\u6807\u51c6\uff08Theta_D > 800 K\uff09\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u91d1\u521a\u77f3\u3001SiC\u3001SiN\u548cBeO\u7b49\u7ecf\u5178\u8d85\u786c\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u5148\u524d\u672a\u62a5\u9053\u7684\u5bccBe-C\u5316\u5408\u7269\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e861500-1700 K\u6e29\u5ea6\u533a\u95f4\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "conclusion": "MKNA\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u591f\u627e\u5230\u7a33\u5b9a\u5019\u9009\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u91cd\u5efa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6750\u6599\u63a2\u7d22\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\u3002"}}

We relate this failure mode to the offline-frontier shift, i.e., the displacement of the offline dataset from the Pareto front, which acts as a fundamental limitation in offline MOO. We argue that overcoming this limitation requires out-of-distribution sampling in objective space (via an integral probability metric) and empirically observe that generative methods remain conservatively close to the offline objective distribution.

Policy optimization algorithms generate a number of responses for a given prompt and then effectively weight the corresponding gradients depending on the rewards. The most popular algorithms including GRPO, DAPO, and RLOO focus on ambiguous prompts, i.e., prompts with intermediate success probability, while downgrading gradients with very easy and very hard prompts. In this paper, we consider asymmetric prompt weightings that assign higher weights to prompts with low, or even zero, empirical success probability. We find that asymmetric weighting particularly benefits from-scratch RL (as in R1-Zero), where training traverses a wide accuracy range, and less so in post-SFT RL where the model already starts at high accuracy. We also provide theory that characterizes prompt weights which minimize the time needed to raise success probability from an initial level to a target accuracy under a fixed update budget. In low-success regimes, where informative responses are rare and response cost dominates, these optimal weights become asymmetric, upweighting low success probabilities and thereby accelerating effective-time convergence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5728LLM\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u63d0\u793a\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u4f4e\u6210\u529f\u6982\u7387\u7684\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u4ece\u96f6\u5f00\u59cb\u7684RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u6536\u655b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RL\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u5982GRPO\u3001DAPO\u3001RLOO\uff09\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u4e2d\u7b49\u6210\u529f\u6982\u7387\u7684\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u975e\u5e38\u5bb9\u6613\u6216\u975e\u5e38\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u964d\u6743\u3002\u7136\u800c\u5728\u4ece\u96f6\u5f00\u59cb\u7684RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f4e\u6210\u529f\u6982\u7387\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u53ef\u80fd\u5305\u542b\u91cd\u8981\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u63d0\u793a\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\uff08\u751a\u81f3\u96f6\uff09\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6210\u529f\u6982\u7387\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5206\u914d\u66f4\u9ad8\u6743\u91cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u786e\u5b9a\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u66f4\u65b0\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c06\u6210\u529f\u6982\u7387\u4ece\u521d\u59cb\u6c34\u5e73\u63d0\u5347\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6240\u9700\u65f6\u95f4\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u7279\u522b\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u4ece\u96f6\u5f00\u59cb\u7684RL\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08\u5982R1-Zero\uff09\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\uff1b\u800c\u5728\u540eSFT RL\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u76f8\u5bf9\u6709\u9650\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u5728\u4f4e\u6210\u529f\u6982\u7387\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u6743\u91cd\u786e\u5b9e\u5448\u73b0\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728LLM\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u7528\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u6743\u91cd\u7b56\u7565\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4ece\u96f6\u5f00\u59cb\u7684RL\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u914d\uff08\u4e0a\u52a0\u6743\u4f4e\u6210\u529f\u6982\u7387\u63d0\u793a\uff09\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u54cd\u5e94\u7a00\u5c11\u4e14\u54cd\u5e94\u6210\u672c\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u4f4e\u6210\u529f\u6982\u7387\u533a\u57df\u3002"}}

We introduce TabICLv2, a new state-of-the-art foundation model for regression and classification built on three pillars: (1) a novel synthetic data generation engine designed for high pretraining diversity; (2) various architectural innovations, including a new scalable softmax in attention improving generalization to larger datasets without prohibitive long-sequence pretraining; and (3) optimized pretraining protocols, notably replacing AdamW with the Muon optimizer. On the TabArena and TALENT benchmarks, TabICLv2 without any tuning surpasses the performance of the current state of the art, RealTabPFN-2.5 (hyperparameter-tuned, ensembled, and fine-tuned on real data). With only moderate pretraining compute, TabICLv2 generalizes effectively to million-scale datasets under 50GB GPU memory while being markedly faster than RealTabPFN-2.5. We provide extensive ablation studies to quantify these contributions and commit to open research by first releasing inference code and model weights at https://github.com/soda-inria/tabicl, with synthetic data engine and pretraining code to follow.", "AI": {"tldr": "TabICLv2\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8868\u683c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5728\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8c03\u53c2\u5373\u53ef\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8868\u683c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982TabPFNv2\u548cTabICL\uff09\u6700\u8fd1\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u6811\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a8\u8fdb\u8fd9\u4e00\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8868\u683c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "TabICLv2\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u5927\u652f\u67f1\u6784\u5efa\uff1a(1) \u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff1b(2) \u591a\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6ce8\u610f\u529bsoftmax\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u8fdb\u884c\u8fc7\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u66f4\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b(3) \u4f18\u5316\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7528Muon\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u66ff\u6362AdamW\u3002", "result": "\u5728TabArena\u548cTALENT\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u672a\u7ecf\u4efb\u4f55\u8c03\u4f18\u7684TabICLv2\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684RealTabPFN-2.5\uff08\u7ecf\u8fc7\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u3001\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\uff09\u3002TabICLv2\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u4e0b\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u767e\u4e07\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4ec5\u970050GB GPU\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u4e14\u901f\u5ea6\u660e\u663e\u5feb\u4e8eRealTabPFN-2.5\u3002", "conclusion": "TabICLv2\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5728\u8868\u683c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u9886\u57df\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u627f\u8bfa\u5f00\u653e\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5df2\u53d1\u5e03\u63a8\u7406\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u968f\u540e\u53d1\u5e03\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5f15\u64ce\u548c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee3\u7801\u3002"}}
