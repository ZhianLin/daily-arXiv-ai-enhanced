### [1] [A Mathematical Framework for AI Singularity: Conditions, Bounds, and Control of Recursive Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10668)
*Akbar Anbar Jafari,Cagri Ozcinar,Gholamreza Anbarjafari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文开发了一个分析框架来研究AI能力的递归自我改进，提出了可测试的条件来判断AI能力是否会无限增长，并提供了可实施的安全控制措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI系统在什么可测量的条件下会出现能力无限增长（失控增长），以及在什么条件下可以排除这种可能性，用可验证的条件取代猜测。

Method: 开发了一个分析框架，将能力增长与资源建设和部署策略联系起来，基于物理和信息论限制定义服务边界，建立内生增长模型来区分超线性和次临界状态。

Result: 推导出基于可观测序列（设施功率、IO带宽、训练吞吐量、基准损失和支出）的决策规则，用于判断失控行为与非奇异行为，提供了可实施的安全控制措施。

Conclusion: 该框架用可测试的条件和可部署的控制措施取代了对AI奇点的猜测，为认证或排除AI奇点提供了理论基础和实践工具。

Abstract: AI systems improve by drawing on more compute, data, energy, and better training methods. This paper asks a precise, testable version of the "runaway growth" question: under what measurable conditions could capability escalate without bound in finite time, and under what conditions can that be ruled out? We develop an analytic framework for recursive self-improvement that links capability growth to resource build-out and deployment policies. Physical and information-theoretic limits from power, bandwidth, and memory define a service envelope that caps instantaneous improvement. An endogenous growth model couples capital to compute, data, and energy and defines a critical boundary separating superlinear from subcritical regimes. We derive decision rules that map observable series (facility power, IO bandwidth, training throughput, benchmark losses, and spending) into yes/no certificates for runaway versus nonsingular behavior. The framework yields falsifiable tests based on how fast improvement accelerates relative to its current level, and it provides safety controls that are directly implementable in practice, such as power caps, throughput throttling, and evaluation gates. Analytical case studies cover capped-power, saturating-data, and investment-amplified settings, illustrating when the envelope binds and when it does not. The approach is simulation-free and grounded in measurements engineers already collect. Limitations include dependence on the chosen capability metric and on regularity diagnostics; future work will address stochastic dynamics, multi-agent competition, and abrupt architectural shifts. Overall, the results replace speculation with testable conditions and deployable controls for certifying or precluding an AI singularity.

Abstract: CAR-Scenes is a frame-level dataset for autonomous driving that enables training and evaluation of vision-language models (VLMs) for interpretable, scene-level understanding. We annotate 5,192 images drawn from Argoverse 1, Cityscapes, KITTI, and nuScenes using a 28-key category/sub-category knowledge base covering environment, road geometry, background-vehicle behavior, ego-vehicle behavior, vulnerable road users, sensor states, and a discrete severity scale (1-10), totaling 350+ leaf attributes. Labels are produced by a GPT-4o-assisted vision-language pipeline with human-in-the-loop verification; we release the exact prompts, post-processing rules, and per-field baseline model performance. CAR-Scenes also provides attribute co-occurrence graphs and JSONL records that support semantic retrieval, dataset triage, and risk-aware scenario mining across sources. To calibrate task difficulty, we include reproducible, non-benchmark baselines, notably a LoRA-tuned Qwen2-VL-2B with deterministic decoding, evaluated via scalar accuracy, micro-averaged F1 for list attributes, and severity MAE/RMSE on a fixed validation split. We publicly release the annotation and analysis scripts, including graph construction and evaluation scripts, to enable explainable, data-centric workflows for future intelligent vehicles.

### [3] [Accelerating Controllable Generation via Hybrid-grained Cache](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11031)
*Lin Liu,Huixia Ben,Shuo Wang,Jinda Lu,Junxiang Qiu,Shengeng Tang,Yanbin Hao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合粒度缓存（HGC）方法，通过在不同计算阶段采用不同粒度的缓存策略来减少可控生成模型的计算开销，包括块级粗粒度缓存和提示级细粒度缓存。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决可控生成模型在处理控制条件和内容生成时的计算效率低下问题，这些模型通常需要大量计算资源导致生成效率较低。

Method: 采用混合粒度缓存策略：1）粗粒度缓存（块级）基于特征重用，在模型推理的每一步中动态绕过编码器-解码器块中的冗余计算；2）细粒度缓存（提示级）在模块内重用跨注意力图，并将其扩展到相邻步骤的相应模块计算中。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上验证了HGC的有效性，特别是在COCO-Stuff分割基准上，计算成本（MACs）显著降低了63%（从18.22T降至6.70T），同时语义保真度损失控制在1.5%以内。

Conclusion: HGC方法在平衡生成效率和视觉质量方面具有优势，能够显著降低计算开销同时保持生成质量。

Abstract: Controllable generative models have been widely used to improve the realism of synthetic visual content. However, such models must handle control conditions and content generation computational requirements, resulting in generally low generation efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a Hybrid-Grained Cache (HGC) approach that reduces computational overhead by adopting cache strategies with different granularities at different computational stages. Specifically, (1) we use a coarse-grained cache (block-level) based on feature reuse to dynamically bypass redundant computations in encoder-decoder blocks between each step of model reasoning. (2) We design a fine-grained cache (prompt-level) that acts within a module, where the fine-grained cache reuses cross-attention maps within consecutive reasoning steps and extends them to the corresponding module computations of adjacent steps. These caches of different granularities can be seamlessly integrated into each computational link of the controllable generation process. We verify the effectiveness of HGC on four benchmark datasets, especially its advantages in balancing generation efficiency and visual quality. For example, on the COCO-Stuff segmentation benchmark, our HGC significantly reduces the computational cost (MACs) by 63% (from 18.22T to 6.70T), while keeping the loss of semantic fidelity (quantized performance degradation) within 1.5%.

### [4] [Toward Generalized Detection of Synthetic Media: Limitations, Challenges, and the Path to Multimodal Solutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11116)
*Redwan Hussain,Mizanur Rahman,Prithwiraj Bhattacharjee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文综述了24篇关于AI生成媒体检测的最新研究，分析了现有方法的局限性，并提出基于多模态深度学习模型的研究方向，以建立更强大的合成媒体防御系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着GAN和扩散模型等AI技术的快速发展，合成媒体质量大幅提升，导致真实与虚假内容难以区分。深度伪造等技术的滥用引发了错误信息传播、隐私侵犯和欺诈等问题，因此需要开发有效的检测方法。

Method: 系统回顾了24篇相关研究，逐一分析每项研究的贡献和弱点，总结现有方法的共同局限性和关键挑战。

Result: 现有检测模型（如CNN和ViT）在泛化性方面存在不足，难以处理未见数据和不同模型生成的内容，对多模态数据和高度修改内容的检测效果不佳。

Conclusion: 建议未来研究聚焦于多模态深度学习模型，这种模型有潜力提供更鲁棒和通用的检测能力，为构建更强的合成媒体防御系统提供明确起点。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) in media has advanced rapidly over the last decade. The introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) improved the quality of photorealistic image generation. Diffusion models later brought a new era of generative media. These advances made it difficult to separate real and synthetic content. The rise of deepfakes demonstrated how these tools could be misused to spread misinformation, political conspiracies, privacy violations, and fraud. For this reason, many detection models have been developed. They often use deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). These models search for visual, spatial, or temporal anomalies. However, such approaches often fail to generalize across unseen data and struggle with content from different models. In addition, existing approaches are ineffective in multimodal data and highly modified content. This study reviews twenty-four recent works on AI-generated media detection. Each study was examined individually to identify its contributions and weaknesses, respectively. The review then summarizes the common limitations and key challenges faced by current approaches. Based on this analysis, a research direction is suggested with a focus on multimodal deep learning models. Such models have the potential to provide more robust and generalized detection. It offers future researchers a clear starting point for building stronger defenses against harmful synthetic media.

Result: 在MSCOCO和LAION数据集上的实验表明，该方法在几秒内就能达到更好或竞争性的性能，比现有方法快2500-400000倍。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了在真实世界模型（如Stable Diffusion）上大规模应用数据归因方法的重要进展。

Abstract: Data attribution for text-to-image models aims to identify the training images that most significantly influenced a generated output. Existing attribution methods involve considerable computational resources for each query, making them impractical for real-world applications. We propose a novel approach for scalable and efficient data attribution. Our key idea is to distill a slow, unlearning-based attribution method to a feature embedding space for efficient retrieval of highly influential training images. During deployment, combined with efficient indexing and search methods, our method successfully finds highly influential images without running expensive attribution algorithms. We show extensive results on both medium-scale models trained on MSCOCO and large-scale Stable Diffusion models trained on LAION, demonstrating that our method can achieve better or competitive performance in a few seconds, faster than existing methods by 2,500x - 400,000x. Our work represents a meaningful step towards the large-scale application of data attribution methods on real-world models such as Stable Diffusion.

Conclusion: ColoWorkflow为微创结直肠手术提供了首个基于共识的验证视频评估工具，建立了可重复的工作流程分析框架，支持跨机构基准测试和AI驱动的工作流程识别发展。

Abstract: Minimally invasive colorectal surgery is characterized by procedural variability, a difficult learning curve, and complications that impact quality and outcomes. Video-based assessment (VBA) offers an opportunity to generate data-driven insights to reduce variability, optimize training, and improve surgical performance. However, existing tools for workflow analysis remain difficult to standardize and implement. This study aims to develop and validate a VBA tool for workflow analysis across minimally invasive colorectal procedures. A Delphi process was conducted to achieve consensus on generalizable workflow descriptors. The resulting framework informed the development of a new VBA tool, ColoWorkflow. Independent raters then applied ColoWorkflow to a multicentre video dataset of laparoscopic and robotic colorectal surgery (CRS). Applicability and inter-rater reliability were evaluated. Consensus was achieved for 10 procedure-agnostic phases and 34 procedure-specific steps describing CRS workflows. ColoWorkflow was developed and applied to 54 colorectal operative videos (left and right hemicolectomies, sigmoid and rectosigmoid resections, and total proctocolectomies) from five centres. The tool demonstrated broad applicability, with all but one label utilized. Inter-rater reliability was moderate, with mean Cohen's K of 0.71 for phases and 0.66 for steps. Most discrepancies arose at phase transitions and step boundary definitions. ColoWorkflow is the first consensus-based, validated VBA tool for comprehensive workflow analysis in minimally invasive CRS. It establishes a reproducible framework for video-based performance assessment, enabling benchmarking across institutions and supporting the development of artificial intelligence-driven workflow recognition. Its adoption may standardize training, accelerate competency acquisition, and advance data-informed surgical quality improvement.

Main category: cs.CV

Conclusion: 该方法通过频率域分析和多模态特征对齐，有效解决了遥感图像分类中的多模态泛化问题，展现出强大的跨场景适应能力。

Abstract: The booming remote sensing (RS) technology is giving rise to a novel multimodality generalization task, which requires the model to overcome data heterogeneity while possessing powerful cross-scene generalization ability. Moreover, most vision-language models (VLMs) usually describe surface materials in RS images using universal texts, lacking proprietary linguistic prior knowledge specific to different RS vision modalities. In this work, we formalize RS multimodality generalization (RSMG) as a learning paradigm, and propose a frequency-aware vision-language multimodality generalization network (FVMGN) for RS image classification. Specifically, a diffusion-based training-test-time augmentation (DTAug) strategy is designed to reconstruct multimodal land-cover distributions, enriching input information for FVMGN. Following that, to overcome multimodal heterogeneity, a multimodal wavelet disentanglement (MWDis) module is developed to learn cross-domain invariant features by resampling low and high frequency components in the frequency domain. Considering the characteristics of RS vision modalities, shared and proprietary class texts is designed as linguistic inputs for the transformer-based text encoder to extract diverse text features. For multimodal vision inputs, a spatial-frequency-aware image encoder (SFIE) is constructed to realize local-global feature reconstruction and representation. Finally, a multiscale spatial-frequency feature alignment (MSFFA) module is suggested to construct a unified semantic space, ensuring refined multiscale alignment of different text and vision features in spatial and frequency domains. Extensive experiments show that FVMGN has the excellent multimodality generalization ability compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) significantly reduces computational and memory costs by updating only a small subset of the model's parameters, enabling faster adaptation to new tasks with minimal loss in performance. Previous studies have introduced PEFTs tailored for point cloud data, as general approaches are suboptimal. To further reduce the number of trainable parameters, we propose a point-cloud-specific PEFT, termed Graph Features Tuning (GFT), which learns a dynamic graph from initial tokenized inputs of the transformer using a lightweight graph convolution network and passes these graph features to deeper layers via skip connections and efficient cross-attention modules. Extensive experiments on object classification and segmentation tasks show that GFT operates in the same domain, rivalling existing methods, while reducing the trainable parameters.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used in image recognition and have succeeded in various domains. CNN models have become larger-scale to improve accuracy and generalization performance. Research has been conducted on compressing pre-trained models for specific target applications in environments with limited computing resources. Among model compression techniques, methods using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), an explainable AI technique, have shown promise by achieving high pruning rates while preserving accuracy, even without fine-tuning. Because these methods do not require fine-tuning, they are suited to scenarios with limited data. However, existing LRP-based pruning approaches still suffer from significant accuracy degradation, limiting their practical usability. This study proposes a pruning method that achieves a higher pruning rate while preserving better model accuracy. Our approach to pruning with a small amount of data has achieved pruning that preserves accuracy better than existing methods.

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition plays a key role in many domains, including mental health monitoring, educational interaction, and human-computer interaction. However, existing methods often face three major challenges: unbalanced category distribution, the complexity of dynamic facial action unit time modeling, and the difficulty of feature fusion due to modal heterogeneity. With the explosive growth of multimodal data in social media scenarios, the need for building an efficient cross-modal fusion framework for emotion recognition is becoming increasingly urgent. To this end, this paper proposes Multimodal Cross-Attention Network and Contrastive Learning (MCN-CL) for multimodal emotion recognition. It uses a triple query mechanism and hard negative mining strategy to remove feature redundancy while preserving important emotional cues, effectively addressing the issues of modal heterogeneity and category imbalance. Experiment results on the IEMOCAP and MELD datasets show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, with Weighted F1 scores improving by 3.42% and 5.73%, respectively.

Abstract: Object detection using images or videos captured by drones is a promising technology with significant potential across various industries. However, a major challenge is that drone images are typically taken from high altitudes, making object identification difficult. This paper proposes an effective solution to address this issue. The base model used in the experiments is YOLOv11, the latest object detection model, with a specific implementation based on YOLOv11n. The experimental data were sourced from the widely used and reliable VisDrone dataset, a standard benchmark in drone-based object detection. This paper introduces an enhancement to the Head network of the YOLOv11 algorithm, called the GhostHead Network. The model incorporating this improvement is named YOLO-Drone. Experimental results demonstrate that YOLO-Drone achieves significant improvements in key detection accuracy metrics, including Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and mAP (0.5), compared to the original YOLOv11. Specifically, the proposed model recorded a 0.4% increase in Precision, a 0.6% increase in Recall, a 0.5% increase in F1-Score, and a 0.5% increase in mAP (0.5). Additionally, the Inference Speed metric, which measures image processing speed, also showed a notable improvement. These results indicate that YOLO-Drone is a high-performance model with enhanced accuracy and speed compared to YOLOv11. To further validate its reliability, comparative experiments were conducted against other high-performance object detection models, including YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLOv10. The results confirmed that the proposed model outperformed YOLOv8 by 0.1% in mAP (0.5) and surpassed YOLOv9 and YOLOv10 by 0.3% and 0.6%, respectively.

Abstract: Attribution is essential for interpreting object-level foundation models. Recent methods based on submodular subset selection have achieved high faithfulness, but their efficiency limitations hinder practical deployment in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose PhaseWin, a novel phase-window search algorithm that enables faithful region attribution with near-linear complexity. PhaseWin replaces traditional quadratic-cost greedy selection with a phased coarse-to-fine search, combining adaptive pruning, windowed fine-grained selection, and dynamic supervision mechanisms to closely approximate greedy behavior while dramatically reducing model evaluations. Theoretically, PhaseWin retains near-greedy approximation guarantees under mild monotone submodular assumptions. Empirically, PhaseWin achieves over 95% of greedy attribution faithfulness using only 20% of the computational budget, and consistently outperforms other attribution baselines across object detection and visual grounding tasks with Grounding DINO and Florence-2. PhaseWin establishes a new state of the art in scalable, high-faithfulness attribution for object-level multimodal models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种正负提示监督方法，通过优化正负提示来增强基于能量的OOD检测器性能，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。

Motivation: 现有的负提示方法包含广泛的非ID特征，可能导致捕获重叠或误导性信息，从而产生次优结果。

Method: 使用LLM初始化类别特定的正负提示，优化后正提示关注类内特征，负提示强调类别边界特征，并通过图架构聚合语义监督传播到视觉分支。

Conclusion: 提出的正负提示监督方法能有效提升OOD检测性能，通过优化提示表示和语义知识传递实现了更好的检测效果。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is committed to delineating the classification boundaries between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable OOD detection performance by integrating both visual and textual modalities. In this context, negative prompts are introduced to emphasize the dissimilarity between image features and prompt content. However, these prompts often include a broad range of non-ID features, which may result in suboptimal outcomes due to the capture of overlapping or misleading information. To address this issue, we propose Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision, which encourages negative prompts to capture inter-class features and transfers this semantic knowledge to the visual modality to enhance OOD detection performance. Our method begins with class-specific positive and negative prompts initialized by large language models (LLMs). These prompts are subsequently optimized, with positive prompts focusing on features within each class, while negative prompts highlight features around category boundaries. Additionally, a graph-based architecture is employed to aggregate semantic-aware supervision from the optimized prompt representations and propagate it to the visual branch, thereby enhancing the performance of the energy-based OOD detector. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K, across eight OOD datasets and five different LLMs, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition remains a challenging task, especially in unconstrained, real-world environments. This study investigates the performance of two lightweight models, YOLOv11n and YOLOv12n, which are the nano variants of the latest official YOLO series, within a unified detection and classification framework for FER. Two benchmark classification datasets, FER2013 and KDEF, are converted into object detection format and model performance is evaluated using mAP 0.5, precision, recall, and confusion matrices. Results show that YOLOv12n achieves the highest overall performance on the clean KDEF dataset with a mAP 0.5 of 95.6, and also outperforms YOLOv11n on the FER2013 dataset in terms of mAP 63.8, reflecting stronger sensitivity to varied expressions. In contrast, YOLOv11n demonstrates higher precision 65.2 on FER2013, indicating fewer false positives and better reliability in noisy, real-world conditions. On FER2013, both models show more confusion between visually similar expressions, while clearer class separation is observed on the cleaner KDEF dataset. These findings underscore the trade-off between sensitivity and precision, illustrating how lightweight YOLO models can effectively balance performance and efficiency. The results demonstrate adaptability across both controlled and real-world conditions, establishing these models as strong candidates for real-time, resource-constrained emotion-aware AI applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为异构互补蒸馏（HCD）的新框架，用于解决异构架构（如ViT到ResNet18）知识蒸馏中的特征表示差异问题。该方法通过整合师生互补特征、共享logits对齐和子logit解耦蒸馏，实现了高效的知识转移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异构架构知识蒸馏面临空间特征表示差异的挑战，传统方法主要针对同构架构设计，而现有异构方法要么计算成本高、设计复杂，要么过度依赖logit对齐，无法充分利用互补特征。

Method: HCD框架包含：1）通过卷积投影器和自适应池化处理学生中间特征；2）与教师倒数第二层特征拼接后通过CFM模块映射为共享logits；3）提出子logit解耦蒸馏（SDD）将共享logits划分为n个子logits；4）引入正交损失（OL）确保子logit多样性。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、细粒度数据集（如CUB200）和ImageNet-1K上的广泛实验表明，HCD优于最先进的知识蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: HCD通过保留学生特定优势并利用教师知识，增强了学生的鲁棒性和泛化能力，是异构知识蒸馏的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD)transfers the dark knowledge from a complex teacher to a compact student. However, heterogeneous architecture distillation, such as Vision Transformer (ViT) to ResNet18, faces challenges due to differences in spatial feature representations.Traditional KD methods are mostly designed for homogeneous architectures and hence struggle to effectively address the disparity. Although heterogeneous KD approaches have been developed recently to solve these issues, they often incur high computational costs and complex designs, or overly rely on logit alignment, which limits their ability to leverage the complementary features. To overcome these limitations, we propose Heterogeneous Complementary Distillation (HCD),a simple yet effective framework that integrates complementary teacher and student features to align representations in shared logits.These logits are decomposed and constrained to facilitate diverse knowledge transfer to the student. Specifically, HCD processes the student's intermediate features through convolutional projector and adaptive pooling, concatenates them with teacher's feature from the penultimate layer and then maps them via the Complementary Feature Mapper (CFM) module, comprising fully connected layer,to produce shared logits.We further introduce Sub-logit Decoupled Distillation (SDD) that partitions the shared logits into n sub-logits, which are fused with teacher's logits to rectify classification.To ensure sub-logit diversity and reduce redundant knowledge transfer, we propose an Orthogonality Loss (OL).By preserving student-specific strengths and leveraging teacher knowledge,HCD enhances robustness and generalization in students.Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100, Fine-grained (e.g., CUB200)and ImageNet-1K datasets demonstrate that HCD outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods,establishing it as an effective solution for heterogeneous KD.

<details>

Result: 在两个公共数据集上的广泛实验表明该方法表现出显著性能

Conclusion: FedBCS通过领域不变上下文原型对齐有效解决了联邦学习中的特征异质性问题

Abstract: Federated learning enables multiple medical institutions to train a global model without sharing data, yet feature heterogeneity from diverse scanners or protocols remains a major challenge. Many existing works attempt to address this issue by leveraging model representations (e.g., mean feature vectors) to correct local training; however, they often face two key limitations: 1) Incomplete Contextual Representation Learning: Current approaches primarily focus on final-layer features, overlooking critical multi-level cues and thus diluting essential context for accurate segmentation. 2) Layerwise Style Bias Accumulation: Although utilizing representations can partially align global features, these methods neglect domain-specific biases within intermediate layers, allowing style discrepancies to build up and reduce model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose FedBCS to bridge feature representation gaps via domain-invariant contextual prototypes alignment. Specifically, we introduce a frequency-domain adaptive style recalibration into prototype construction that not only decouples content-style representations but also learns optimal style parameters, enabling more robust domain-invariant prototypes. Furthermore, we design a context-aware dual-level prototype alignment method that extracts domain-invariant prototypes from different layers of both encoder and decoder and fuses them with contextual information for finer-grained representation alignment. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our method exhibits remarkable performance.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在3D相关任务（如空间认知和物理理解）上表现不佳，这限制了其在机器人和具身智能等现实应用中的潜力。主要原因是3D任务与VLM的2D训练之间存在模态差距。

Method: 提出了SandboxVLM框架，包含四个阶段的3D沙盒重建和感知流程：生成带抽象控制的多视角先验、代理高程、多视角投票聚类以及3D感知推理。

Result: 在多个基准测试和VLM骨干网络上进行零样本评估，方法一致提升空间智能，在SAT Real基准上相比基线方法获得8.3%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 为视觉语言模型配备3D抽象能力可以显著增强其3D推理能力，无需额外训练，为通用具身智能开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with 3D-related tasks such as spatial cognition and physical understanding, which are crucial for real-world applications like robotics and embodied agents. We attribute this to a modality gap between the 3D tasks and the 2D training of VLM, which led to inefficient retrieval of 3D information from 2D input. To bridge this gap, we introduce SandboxVLM, a simple yet effective framework that leverages abstract bounding boxes to encode geometric structure and physical kinematics for VLM. Specifically, we design a 3D Sandbox reconstruction and perception pipeline comprising four stages: generating multi-view priors with abstract control, proxy elevation, multi-view voting and clustering, and 3D-aware reasoning. Evaluated in zero-shot settings across multiple benchmarks and VLM backbones, our approach consistently improves spatial intelligence, achieving an 8.3\% gain on SAT Real compared with baseline methods for instance. These results demonstrate that equipping VLMs with a 3D abstraction substantially enhances their 3D reasoning ability without additional training, suggesting new possibilities for general-purpose embodied intelligence.

Motivation: 微表情识别对于推断真实情感至关重要。现有方法面临两个核心挑战：静态外观与动态运动线索的纠缠阻碍模型关注细微运动；现有数据集中的文本标签与底层面部肌肉运动不完全对应，造成文本监督与物理运动之间的语义鸿沟。

Method: 提出DEFT-LLM方法，通过多专家解耦实现运动语义对齐。首先构建Uni-MER运动驱动指令数据集，利用光流和动作单元标签的双重约束确保时空一致性和与运动的合理对应。然后设计包含三个专家的架构，将面部动态解耦为独立可解释的表征（结构、动态纹理和运动语义）。

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的微表情识别基准测试中展示了最先进的性能，并在局部面部运动的可解释建模方面具有特殊优势。

Conclusion: 通过将Uni-MER中的指令对齐知识整合到DEFT-LLM中，该方法为微表情注入了有效的物理先验，同时利用大语言模型的跨模态推理能力，从而能够精确捕捉细微的情感线索。

Abstract: Micro expression recognition (MER) is crucial for inferring genuine emotion. Applying a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to this task enables spatio-temporal analysis of facial motion and provides interpretable descriptions. However, there are still two core challenges: (1) The entanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion cues prevents the model from focusing on subtle motion; (2) Textual labels in existing MER datasets do not fully correspond to underlying facial muscle movements, creating a semantic gap between text supervision and physical motion. To address these issues, we propose DEFT-LLM, which achieves motion semantic alignment by multi-expert disentanglement. We first introduce Uni-MER, a motion-driven instruction dataset designed to align text with local facial motion. Its construction leverages dual constraints from optical flow and Action Unit (AU) labels to ensure spatio-temporal consistency and reasonable correspondence to the movements. We then design an architecture with three experts to decouple facial dynamics into independent and interpretable representations (structure, dynamic textures, and motion-semantics). By integrating the instruction-aligned knowledge from Uni-MER into DEFT-LLM, our method injects effective physical priors for micro expressions while also leveraging the cross modal reasoning ability of large language models, thus enabling precise capture of subtle emotional cues. Experiments on multiple challenging MER benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, as well as a particular advantage in interpretable modeling of local facial motion.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of video content on social media, video summarization has become a crucial task in multimedia processing. However, existing methods face challenges in capturing global dependencies in video content and accommodating multimodal user customization. Moreover, temporal proximity between video frames does not always correspond to semantic proximity. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Language-guided Graph Representation Learning Network (LGRLN) for video summarization. Specifically, we introduce a video graph generator that converts video frames into a structured graph to preserve temporal order and contextual dependencies. By constructing forward, backward and undirected graphs, the video graph generator effectively preserves the sequentiality and contextual relationships of video content. We designed an intra-graph relational reasoning module with a dual-threshold graph convolution mechanism, which distinguishes semantically relevant frames from irrelevant ones between nodes. Additionally, our proposed language-guided cross-modal embedding module generates video summaries with specific textual descriptions. We model the summary generation output as a mixture of Bernoulli distribution and solve it with the EM algorithm. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, we proposed LGRLN reduces inference time and model parameters by 87.8% and 91.7%, respectively. Our codes and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/liwrui/LGRLN.

Conclusion: TG-DFER通过文本引导和连贯时序建模有效解决了动态面部表情识别中的多对一标注问题，提升了识别性能。

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) aims to identify emotional states by modeling the temporal changes in facial movements across video sequences. A key challenge in DFER is the many-to-one labeling problem, where a video composed of numerous frames is assigned a single emotion label. A common strategy to mitigate this issue is to formulate DFER as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem. However, MIL-based approaches inherently suffer from the visual diversity of emotional expressions and the complexity of temporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose TG-DFER, a text-guided weakly supervised framework that enhances MIL-based DFER by incorporating semantic guidance and coherent temporal modeling. We incorporate a vision-language pre-trained (VLP) model is integrated to provide semantic guidance through fine-grained textual descriptions of emotional context. Furthermore, we introduce visual prompts, which align enriched textual emotion labels with visual instance features, enabling fine-grained reasoning and frame-level relevance estimation. In addition, a multi-grained temporal network is designed to jointly capture short-term facial dynamics and long-range emotional flow, ensuring coherent affective understanding across time. Extensive results demonstrate that TG-DFER achieves improved generalization, interpretability, and temporal sensitivity under weak supervision.

Conclusion: ERMoE为稀疏专家模型引入了新的架构原则，直接解决路由不稳定性，在保持稀疏性的同时实现可扩展、可解释的专家专业化和改进的性能。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures expand model capacity by sparsely activating experts but face two core challenges: misalignment between router logits and each expert's internal structure leads to unstable routing and expert underutilization, and load imbalances create straggler bottlenecks. Standard solutions, such as auxiliary load-balancing losses, can reduce load disparities but often weaken expert specialization and hurt downstream performance. To address these issues, we propose ERMoE, a sparse MoE transformer that reparameterizes each expert in a learned orthonormal eigenbasis and replaces learned gating logits with an "Eigenbasis Score", defined as the cosine similarity between input features and an expert's basis. This content-aware routing ties token assignments directly to experts' representation spaces, stabilizing utilization and promoting interpretable specialization without sacrificing sparsity. Crucially, ERMoE removes the need for explicit balancing losses and avoids the interfering gradients they introduce. We show that ERMoE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet classification and cross-modal image-text retrieval benchmarks (e.g., COCO, Flickr30K), while naturally producing flatter expert load distributions. Moreover, a 3D MRI variant (ERMoE-ba) improves brain age prediction accuracy by more than 7\% and yields anatomically interpretable expert specializations. ERMoE thus introduces a new architectural principle for sparse expert models that directly addresses routing instabilities and enables improved performance with scalable, interpretable specialization.

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) enables models to continuously learn new categories from sequential tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. While recent advances in vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong generalization across domains, extending them to continual settings remains challenging. In particular, learning task-specific soft prompts for newly introduced classes often leads to severe classifier bias, as the text prototypes overfit to recent categories when prior data are unavailable. In this paper, we propose DMC, a simple yet effective two-stage framework for CLIP-based CIL that decouples the adaptation of the vision encoder and the optimization of textual soft prompts. Each stage is trained with the other frozen, allowing one modality to act as a stable semantic anchor for the other to preserve cross-modal alignment. Furthermore, current CLIP-based CIL approaches typically store class-wise Gaussian statistics for generative replay, yet they overlook the distributional drift that arises when the vision encoder is updated over time. To address this issue, we introduce DMC-OT, an enhanced version of DMC that incorporates an optimal-transport guided calibration strategy to align memory statistics across evolving encoders, along with a task-specific prompting design that enhances inter-task separability. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, Imagenet-R, CUB-200, and UCF-101 demonstrate that both DMC and DMC-OT achieve state-of-the-art performance, with DMC-OT further improving accuracy by an average of 1.80%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频LLM存在时序不一致问题：帧时序的微小偏移会翻转注意力并抑制相关帧。这源于多模态RoPE扩展引起的时间核波动，扰乱了本应由原始查询键内积控制的注意力。

Method: 提出PAS方法：在多个头上应用小的相反相位偏移，然后聚合输出。该方法保持每头频谱幅度，同时通过聚合有效平滑时间核并减少相位敏感性，无需改变位置编码结构。

Result: 在多个视频理解基准测试中，在匹配token预算下显示出持续改进，计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: PAS为视频LLM提供了即插即用的鲁棒时序编码升级方案。

Abstract: Video LLMs suffer from temporal inconsistency: small shifts in frame timing can flip attention and suppress relevant frames. We trace this instability to the common extension of Rotary Position Embeddings to video through multimodal RoPE. The induced inverse Fourier time kernel exhibits frame-scale ripples that multiply adjacent frames by different factors, which perturbs attention that should otherwise be governed by the raw query key inner product. We present Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS), a simple, training-free mechanism that applies small opposed phase offsets across heads and then aggregates their outputs. PAS preserves the per-head spectrum magnitude, while the aggregation effectively smooths the temporal kernel and reduces phase sensitivity without changing the positional encoding structure. Our analysis shows that the RoPE rotated logit can be approximated as a content dot product scaled by a time kernel; smoothing this kernel yields Lipschitz stability of attention to small temporal shifts; multi phase averaging attenuates high frequency ripples while preserving per-head spectra under Nyquist-valid sampling. Experiments on multiple video understanding benchmarks under matched token budgets show consistent improvements with negligible computational overhead. PAS provides a plug and play upgrade for robust temporal encoding in Video LLMs.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个简单统一的推理时工作流，无需任务特定训练即可显著提升零样本视觉任务的性能，具有实用性和通用性。

Abstract: We propose a training-free, binary verification workflow for zero-shot vision with off-the-shelf VLMs. It comprises two steps: (i) quantization, which turns the open-ended query into a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with a small, explicit list of unambiguous candidates; and (ii) binarization, which asks one True/False question per candidate and resolves deterministically: if exactly one is True, select it; otherwise, revert to an MCQ over the remaining plausible candidates. We evaluate the workflow on referring expression grounding (REC), spatial reasoning (Spatial-Map, Spatial-Grid, Spatial-Maze), and BLINK-Jigsaw. Relative to answering open-ended queries directly, quantization to MCQ yields large gains, and True/False binarization provides a consistent additional boost. Across all tasks, the same workflow produces significant improvements, indicating generality. Our theory formalizes how open-ended vision queries can be quantized to MCQs and further binarized into True/False verifications, establishing a hardness ladder. A simple analysis explains why Boolean resolution boosts accuracy. Together, these components yield a simple and unified workflow that emphasizes inference-time design over task-specific training. It offers a practical, drop-in path to stronger zero-shot vision with today's VLMs.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models, the theoretical performance benchmark for learned lossless image compression, are often dismissed as impractical due to prohibitive computational cost. This work re-thinks this paradigm, introducing a framework built on hierarchical parallelism and progressive adaptation that re-establishes pure autoregression as a top-performing and practical solution. Our approach is embodied in the Hierarchical Parallel Autoregressive ConvNet (HPAC), an ultra-lightweight pre-trained model using a hierarchical factorized structure and content-aware convolutional gating to efficiently capture spatial dependencies. We introduce two key optimizations for practicality: Cache-then-Select Inference (CSI), which accelerates coding by eliminating redundant computations, and Adaptive Focus Coding (AFC), which efficiently extends the framework to high bit-depth images. Building on this efficient foundation, our progressive adaptation strategy is realized by Spatially-Aware Rate-Guided Progressive Fine-tuning (SARP-FT). This instance-level strategy fine-tunes the model for each test image by optimizing low-rank adapters on progressively larger, spatially-continuous regions selected via estimated information density. Experiments on diverse datasets (natural, satellite, medical) validate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art compression. Notably, our approach sets a new benchmark in learned lossless compression, showing a carefully designed AR framework can offer significant gains over existing methods with a small parameter count and competitive coding speeds.

TL;DR: CLUE是一个基于Stable Diffusion的生成模型框架，通过固定格式提示实现多样且稳定的图像生成，无需额外数据，在医学领域等数据有限的专门领域表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像合成模型在专门领域（如医学）中面临的数据类型有限、数据量不足的问题，这些领域无法使用通用领域的方法。

Method: 基于Stable Diffusion架构，使用Style Encoder处理图像和提示生成风格嵌入，通过新的第二注意力层和Kullback-Leibler散度实现潜在空间的连续高斯表示。

Result: 在中耳炎数据集上，FID从46.81降至9.30，召回率从49.60%提升至70.29%。仅使用合成数据训练的模型F1分数达83.21%，合成与真实数据结合时F1分数达94.76%。

Conclusion: CLUE能够从有限数据集中实现多样且稳定的图像生成，是领域特定应用的有效数据增强方法。

Abstract: Text-to-image synthesis models require the ability to generate diverse images while maintaining stability. To overcome this challenge, a number of methods have been proposed, including the collection of prompt-image datasets and the integration of additional data modalities during training. Although these methods have shown promising results in general domains, they face limitations when applied to specialized fields such as medicine, where only limited types and insufficient amounts of data are available. We present CLUE (Controllable Latent space of Unprompted Embeddings), a generative model framework that achieves diverse generation while maintaining stability through fixed-format prompts without requiring any additional data. Based on the Stable Diffusion architecture, CLUE employs a Style Encoder that processes images and prompts to generate style embeddings, which are subsequently fed into a new second attention layer of the U-Net architecture. Through Kullback-Leibler divergence, the latent space achieves continuous representation of image features within Gaussian regions, independent of prompts. Performance was assessed on otitis media dataset. CLUE reduced FID to 9.30 (vs. 46.81) and improved recall to 70.29% (vs. 49.60%). A classifier trained on synthetic-only data at 1000% scale achieved an F1 score of 83.21% (vs. 73.83%). Combining synthetic data with equal amounts of real data achieved an F1 score of 94.76%, higher than when using only real data. On an external dataset, synthetic-only training achieved an F1 score of 76.77% (vs. 60.61%) at 1000% scale. The combined approach achieved an F1 score of 85.78%, higher than when using only the internal dataset. These results demonstrate that CLUE enables diverse yet stable image generation from limited datasets and serves as an effective data augmentation method for domain-specific applications.

*Jiajun Chen,Sai Cheng,Yutao Yuan,Yirui Zhang,Haitao Yuan,Peng Peng,Yi Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PROMISE框架，通过多模态提示学习和分层对比学习来解决模态缺失问题，提升跨模态表示的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态模型在真实场景中遇到模态缺失时性能显著下降，主要原因是完整模态数据与不完整模态场景之间的表示学习不一致。现有方法通过简单生成方式处理缺失模态，但无法充分保持跨模态一致性。

Method: PROMISE框架创新地将多模态提示学习融入分层对比学习框架，配备专门的提示注意力机制，动态为缺失模态场景生成鲁棒且一致的表示。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验和消融研究显示，PROMISE相比当前最先进的多模态方法具有优越性能。

Conclusion: PROMISE通过提示注意力分层对比学习有效弥合完整数据与不完整数据之间的表示差距，显著提升了模态缺失情况下的跨模态表示鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal models integrating natural language and visual information have substantially improved generalization of representation models. However, their effectiveness significantly declines in real-world situations where certain modalities are missing or unavailable. This degradation primarily stems from inconsistent representation learning between complete multimodal data and incomplete modality scenarios. Existing approaches typically address missing modalities through relatively simplistic generation methods, yet these approaches fail to adequately preserve cross-modal consistency, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multimodal framework named PROMISE, a PROMpting-Attentive HIerarchical ContraStive LEarning approach designed explicitly for robust cross-modal representation under conditions of missing modalities. Specifically, PROMISE innovatively incorporates multimodal prompt learning into a hierarchical contrastive learning framework, equipped with a specially designed prompt-attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically generates robust and consistent representations for scenarios where particular modalities are absent, thereby effectively bridging the representational gap between complete and incomplete data. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, along with comprehensive ablation studies, clearly demonstrate the superior performance of PROMISE compared to current state-of-the-art multimodal methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EmoVid是首个为创意媒体设计的多模态情感标注视频数据集，包含卡通动画、电影片段和动画贴纸，通过情感条件视频生成技术显著提升了视频生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成系统主要关注低层次视觉指标而忽视情感维度，视频领域缺乏专门资源来连接情感理解与生成任务，特别是在风格化和非现实背景下。

Method: 引入EmoVid数据集，包含情感标签、视觉属性和文本标注；通过系统分析发现视觉特征与情感感知的时空模式；基于这些洞察开发了情感条件视频生成技术，通过微调Wan2.1模型实现。

Result: 在文本到视频和图像到视频任务中，生成视频的定量指标和视觉质量均有显著提升。

Conclusion: EmoVid为情感视频计算设立了新基准，不仅为艺术风格化视频的视觉情感分析提供了宝贵见解，也为增强视频生成中的情感表达提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Emotion plays a pivotal role in video-based expression, but existing video generation systems predominantly focus on low-level visual metrics while neglecting affective dimensions. Although emotion analysis has made progress in the visual domain, the video community lacks dedicated resources to bridge emotion understanding with generative tasks, particularly for stylized and non-realistic contexts. To address this gap, we introduce EmoVid, the first multimodal, emotion-annotated video dataset specifically designed for creative media, which includes cartoon animations, movie clips, and animated stickers. Each video is annotated with emotion labels, visual attributes (brightness, colorfulness, hue), and text captions. Through systematic analysis, we uncover spatial and temporal patterns linking visual features to emotional perceptions across diverse video forms. Building on these insights, we develop an emotion-conditioned video generation technique by fine-tuning the Wan2.1 model. The results show a significant improvement in both quantitative metrics and the visual quality of generated videos for text-to-video and image-to-video tasks. EmoVid establishes a new benchmark for affective video computing. Our work not only offers valuable insights into visual emotion analysis in artistically styled videos, but also provides practical methods for enhancing emotional expression in video generation.

TL;DR: MeCaMIL是一个因果感知的多实例学习框架，通过结构化因果图显式建模人口统计学混杂因素，解决了现有方法缺乏因果可解释性和公平性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MIL方法存在两个关键局限：(1)注意力机制缺乏因果可解释性；(2)未能整合患者人口统计学信息，导致跨不同人群的公平性问题，阻碍临床转化。

Method: 采用结构化因果图建模人口统计学混杂因素，利用do-演算和碰撞结构原理性地解耦疾病相关信号与虚假的人口统计学相关性。

Result: 在三个基准测试中达到最先进性能，公平性显著提升——人口统计学差异方差平均降低超过65%，在服务不足人群中表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: MeCaMIL为数字病理学提供了一个原理性框架，实现了公平、可解释且临床可操作的AI。

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged as the dominant paradigm for whole slide image (WSI) analysis in computational pathology, achieving strong diagnostic performance through patch-level feature aggregation. However, existing MIL methods face critical limitations: (1) they rely on attention mechanisms that lack causal interpretability, and (2) they fail to integrate patient demographics (age, gender, race), leading to fairness concerns across diverse populations. These shortcomings hinder clinical translation, where algorithmic bias can exacerbate health disparities. We introduce \textbf{MeCaMIL}, a causality-aware MIL framework that explicitly models demographic confounders through structured causal graphs. Unlike prior approaches treating demographics as auxiliary features, MeCaMIL employs principled causal inference -- leveraging do-calculus and collider structures -- to disentangle disease-relevant signals from spurious demographic correlations. Extensive evaluation on three benchmarks demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across CAMELYON16 (ACC/AUC/F1: 0.939/0.983/0.946), TCGA-Lung (0.935/0.979/0.931), and TCGA-Multi (0.977/0.993/0.970, five cancer types). Critically, MeCaMIL achieves superior fairness -- demographic disparity variance drops by over 65% relative reduction on average across attributes, with notable improvements for underserved populations. The framework generalizes to survival prediction (mean C-index: 0.653, +0.017 over best baseline across five cancer types). Ablation studies confirm causal graph structure is essential -- alternative designs yield 0.048 lower accuracy and 4.2x times worse fairness. These results establish MeCaMIL as a principled framework for fair, interpretable, and clinically actionable AI in digital pathology. Code will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出了Draft and Refine (DnR)代理框架，通过问题条件化的利用率度量来量化LVLMs对视觉信息的依赖程度，并利用外部视觉专家提供针对性反馈来减少幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大视觉语言模型(LVLMs)过度依赖语言先验而非视觉证据，导致产生不接地气或幻觉的响应，需要量化这些模型在推理过程中实际使用视觉信息的程度。

Method: DnR框架包含：1)构建查询条件化相关性图来定位问题特定线索；2)通过相关性引导的概率掩码测量依赖度；3)利用外部视觉专家输出作为视觉线索，重新查询模型选择利用率提升最大的响应。

Result: 在VQA和图像描述基准测试中，该方法实现了准确率的持续提升和幻觉现象的减少。

Conclusion: 测量视觉利用率为构建更可解释和基于证据的多模态代理系统提供了原则性路径。

Abstract: While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit strong multimodal reasoning abilities, they often produce ungrounded or hallucinated responses because they rely too heavily on linguistic priors instead of visual evidence. This limitation highlights the absence of a quantitative measure of how much these models actually use visual information during reasoning. We propose Draft and Refine (DnR), an agent framework driven by a question-conditioned utilization metric. The metric quantifies the model's reliance on visual evidence by first constructing a query-conditioned relevance map to localize question-specific cues and then measuring dependence through relevance-guided probabilistic masking. Guided by this metric, the DnR agent refines its initial draft using targeted feedback from external visual experts. Each expert's output (such as boxes or masks) is rendered as visual cues on the image, and the model is re-queried to select the response that yields the largest improvement in utilization. This process strengthens visual grounding without retraining or architectural changes. Experiments across VQA and captioning benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains and reduced hallucination, demonstrating that measuring visual utilization provides a principled path toward more interpretable and evidence-driven multimodal agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在复杂视觉任务中存在"视觉处理瓶颈"，容易在生成过程中失去视觉证据的根基并缺乏情境化视觉体验。

Method: 提出VisMem框架，包含短期模块用于细粒度感知保留和长期模块用于抽象语义整合，这些记忆在推理过程中被无缝调用。

Result: 在理解、推理和生成等多样化视觉基准测试中，VisMem相比原始模型平均性能提升11.8%，优于所有对比方法。

Conclusion: VisMem为潜在空间记忆增强建立了新范式，能够同时保持感知保真度和语义一致性。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their performance on a range of complex visual tasks is often hindered by a "visual processing bottleneck": a propensity to lose grounding in visual evidence and exhibit a deficit in contextualized visual experience during prolonged generation. Drawing inspiration from human cognitive memory theory, which distinguishes short-term visually-dominant memory and long-term semantically-dominant memory, we propose VisMem, a cognitively-aligned framework that equips VLMs with dynamic latent vision memories, a short-term module for fine-grained perceptual retention and a long-term module for abstract semantic consolidation. These memories are seamlessly invoked during inference, allowing VLMs to maintain both perceptual fidelity and semantic consistency across thinking and generation. Extensive experiments across diverse visual benchmarks for understanding, reasoning, and generation reveal that VisMem delivers a significant average performance boost of 11.8% relative to the vanilla model and outperforms all counterparts, establishing a new paradigm for latent-space memory enhancement. The code will be available: https://github.com/YU-deep/VisMem.git.

TL;DR: SP-Guard是一种改进扩散模型安全性的方法，通过估计提示词危害性并应用选择性引导掩码，只针对不安全区域进行引导，在提高安全性的同时最小化对内容的意外修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理时引导方法缺乏自适应性和选择性，无法根据提示词调整引导强度，也无法只针对图像的不安全区域进行引导。

Method: 通过估计提示词的危害性，并应用选择性引导掩码，只对不安全区域进行引导。

Result: 实验表明SP-Guard比现有方法生成更安全的图像，同时最小化了对内容的意外修改。

Conclusion: 除了提高安全性外，研究结果还强调了图像生成中透明度和可控性的重要性。

Abstract: While diffusion-based T2I models have achieved remarkable image generation quality, they also enable easy creation of harmful content, raising social concerns and highlighting the need for safer generation. Existing inference-time guiding methods lack both adaptivity--adjusting guidance strength based on the prompt--and selectivity--targeting only unsafe regions of the image. Our method, SP-Guard, addresses these limitations by estimating prompt harmfulness and applying a selective guidance mask to guide only unsafe areas. Experiments show that SP-Guard generates safer images than existing methods while minimizing unintended content alteration. Beyond improving safety, our findings highlight the importance of transparency and controllability in image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的跳跃连接编码器-解码器架构（U-Net变体）在逆问题中仍存在信息损失，限制了高频细节的恢复。

Method: 利用小波的完美重构特性防止信息退化，同时选择性抑制冗余特征，作为即插即用解码器块集成到各种U-Net变体中。

Result: 在裂缝检测基准测试中显著提升了细裂缝（宽度小于4像素）的分割性能，在智能手机图像去噪中也获得了PSNR的适度提升。

Conclusion: SUPER解码器块具有即插即用的通用性，能够在统一的重构感知框架中实现高频保真度和全局一致性。

Abstract: Skip-connected encoder-decoder architectures (U-Net variants) are widely adopted for inverse problems but still suffer from information loss, limiting recovery of fine high-frequency details. We present Selectively Suppressed Perfect Reconstruction (SUPER), which exploits the perfect reconstruction (PR) property of wavelets to prevent information degradation while selectively suppressing (SS) redundant features. Free from rigid framelet constraints, SUPER serves as a plug-and-play decoder block for diverse U-Net variants, eliminating their intrinsic reconstruction bottlenecks and enhancing representational richness. Experiments across diverse crack benchmarks, including state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, demonstrate the structural potential of the proposed SUPER Decoder Block. Maintaining comparable computational cost, SUPER enriches representational diversity through increased parameterization. In small-scale in-domain experiments on the CrackVision12K dataset, SUPER markedly improves thin-crack segmentation performance, particularly for cracks narrower than 4 px, underscoring its advantage in high-frequency dominant settings. In smartphone image denoising on SIDD, where low-frequency components prevail, SUPER still achieves a moderate gain in PSNR, confirming its robustness across low- and high-frequency regimes. These results validate its plug-and-play generality across U-Net variants, achieving high-frequency fidelity and global coherence within a unified, reconstruction-aware framework.

Method: 构建包含模拟器和真实世界数据的基准，涵盖场景理解、目标理解、感知评估和协作决策四个维度，通过模型、规则和人工方法生成大规模问题，并进行严格质量控制。

Conclusion: AirCopBench填补了多智能体协作感知评估的空白，揭示了当前MLLM在复杂协作场景中的局限性，为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in single-agent vision tasks, yet benchmarks for evaluating multi-agent collaborative perception remain scarce. This gap is critical, as multi-drone systems provide enhanced coverage, robustness, and collaboration compared to single-sensor setups. Existing multi-image benchmarks mainly target basic perception tasks using high-quality single-agent images, thus failing to evaluate MLLMs in more complex, egocentric collaborative scenarios, especially under real-world degraded perception conditions.To address these challenges, we introduce AirCopBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in embodied aerial collaborative perception under challenging perceptual conditions. AirCopBench includes 14.6k+ questions derived from both simulator and real-world data, spanning four key task dimensions: Scene Understanding, Object Understanding, Perception Assessment, and Collaborative Decision, across 14 task types. We construct the benchmark using data from challenging degraded-perception scenarios with annotated collaborative events, generating large-scale questions through model-, rule-, and human-based methods under rigorous quality control. Evaluations on 40 MLLMs show significant performance gaps in collaborative perception tasks, with the best model trailing humans by 24.38% on average and exhibiting inconsistent results across tasks. Fine-tuning experiments further confirm the feasibility of sim-to-real transfer in aerial collaborative perception and reasoning.

Method: 两阶段扩散框架：1)训练冻结帧级编码器提取多焦点特征；2)多焦点特征融合构建3D感知形态表示，结合语义和边界线索设计混合条件块注入扩散去噪过程。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上分别达到82.8%和81.3%的准确率，仅需单次去噪步骤即可获得最佳平均测试性能。

Conclusion: EmbryoDiff通过扩散模型和多焦点特征融合有效解决了胚胎发育阶段识别中的特征模糊问题，显著提升了分类准确性。

Abstract: Identification of fine-grained embryo developmental stages during In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) is crucial for assessing embryo viability. Although recent deep learning methods have achieved promising accuracy, existing discriminative models fail to utilize the distributional prior of embryonic development to improve accuracy. Moreover, their reliance on single-focal information leads to incomplete embryonic representations, making them susceptible to feature ambiguity under cell occlusions. To address these limitations, we propose EmbryoDiff, a two-stage diffusion-based framework that formulates the task as a conditional sequence denoising process. Specifically, we first train and freeze a frame-level encoder to extract robust multi-focal features. In the second stage, we introduce a Multi-Focal Feature Fusion Strategy that aggregates information across focal planes to construct a 3D-aware morphological representation, effectively alleviating ambiguities arising from cell occlusions. Building on this fused representation, we derive complementary semantic and boundary cues and design a Hybrid Semantic-Boundary Condition Block to inject them into the diffusion-based denoising process, enabling accurate embryonic stage classification. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Notably, with only a single denoising step, our model obtains the best average test performance, reaching 82.8% and 81.3% accuracy on the two datasets, respectively.

Motivation: 揭示医学AI模型如何感知和利用临床数据中隐藏的社会签名，挑战医学图像是中性生物数据的假设。

Method: 使用最先进的架构（DenseNet121、SwinV2-B、MedMamba）在MIMIC-CXR-JPG和CheXpert数据集上训练模型预测健康保险类型，通过基于补丁的遮挡分析信号分布。

Result: 模型能显著预测保险类型，即使在控制年龄、种族和性别后信号依然存在，信号分布在上中胸部区域而非局部化。

Conclusion: 深度学习网络可能内化了临床环境、设备差异或护理路径的微妙痕迹，学习社会经济隔离本身，这重新定义了医学AI公平性的目标——不仅要平衡数据集，还要解构临床数据中嵌入的社会指纹。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is revealing what medicine never intended to encode. Deep vision models, trained on chest X-rays, can now detect not only disease but also invisible traces of social inequality. In this study, we show that state-of-the-art architectures (DenseNet121, SwinV2-B, MedMamba) can predict a patient's health insurance type, a strong proxy for socioeconomic status, from normal chest X-rays with significant accuracy (AUC around 0.67 on MIMIC-CXR-JPG, 0.68 on CheXpert). The signal persists even when age, race, and sex are controlled for, and remains detectable when the model is trained exclusively on a single racial group. Patch-based occlusion reveals that the signal is diffuse rather than localized, embedded in the upper and mid-thoracic regions. This suggests that deep networks may be internalizing subtle traces of clinical environments, equipment differences, or care pathways; learning socioeconomic segregation itself. These findings challenge the assumption that medical images are neutral biological data. By uncovering how models perceive and exploit these hidden social signatures, this work reframes fairness in medical AI: the goal is no longer only to balance datasets or adjust thresholds, but to interrogate and disentangle the social fingerprints embedded in clinical data itself.

Conclusion: MPCGNet通过耦合门机制有效解决了息肉分割的关键挑战，在多个数据集上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Automatic segmentation methods of polyps is crucial for assisting doctors in colorectal polyp screening and cancer diagnosis. Despite the progress made by existing methods, polyp segmentation faces several challenges: (1) small-sized polyps are prone to being missed during identification, (2) the boundaries between polyps and the surrounding environment are often ambiguous, (3) noise in colonoscopy images, caused by uneven lighting and other factors, affects segmentation results. To address these challenges, this paper introduces coupling gates as components in specific modules to filter noise and perform feature importance selection. Three modules are proposed: the coupling gates multiscale feature extraction (CGMFE) module, which effectively extracts local features and suppresses noise; the windows cross attention (WCAD) decoder module, which restores details after capturing the precise location of polyps; and the decoder feature aggregation (DFA) module, which progressively aggregates features, further extracts them, and performs feature importance selection to reduce the loss of small-sized polyps. Experimental results demonstrate that MPCGNet outperforms recent networks, with mDice scores 2.20% and 0.68% higher than the second-best network on the ETIS-LaribPolypDB and CVC-ColonDB datasets, respectively.

Result: 模型在相关分割上表现良好（分类准确率83.2%，分割cIoU 0.75），但在不相关和零重叠条件下性能显著下降，同时发现跨任务迁移能提升分割性能7% cIoU。

Conclusion: CrossMed为评估医学视觉语言模型的零样本、跨任务和模态无关泛化能力提供了严格测试平台，多模态大模型在组合泛化方面表现独特优势。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models have enabled unified processing of visual and textual inputs, offering promising applications in general-purpose medical AI. However, their ability to generalize compositionally across unseen combinations of imaging modality, anatomy, and task type remains underexplored. We introduce CrossMed, a benchmark designed to evaluate compositional generalization (CG) in medical multimodal LLMs using a structured Modality-Anatomy-Task (MAT) schema. CrossMed reformulates four public datasets, CheXpert (X-ray classification), SIIM-ACR (X-ray segmentation), BraTS 2020 (MRI classification and segmentation), and MosMedData (CT classification) into a unified visual question answering (VQA) format, resulting in 20,200 multiple-choice QA instances. We evaluate two open-source multimodal LLMs, LLaVA-Vicuna-7B and Qwen2-VL-7B, on both Related and Unrelated MAT splits, as well as a zero-overlap setting where test triplets share no Modality, Anatomy, or Task with the training data. Models trained on Related splits achieve 83.2 percent classification accuracy and 0.75 segmentation cIoU, while performance drops significantly under Unrelated and zero-overlap conditions, demonstrating the benchmark difficulty. We also show cross-task transfer, where segmentation performance improves by 7 percent cIoU even when trained using classification-only data. Traditional models (ResNet-50 and U-Net) show modest gains, confirming the broad utility of the MAT framework, while multimodal LLMs uniquely excel at compositional generalization. CrossMed provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating zero-shot, cross-task, and modality-agnostic generalization in medical vision-language models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SemanticNN是一个面向物联网设备-边缘协作的语义编解码器，通过容忍比特级错误来追求语义级正确性，在严格的计算和通信约束下实现压缩和弹性的协作推理卸载。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着物联网的快速发展，在极弱嵌入式设备上集成AI引起了广泛关注，但设备资源限制和不可靠的网络条件需要容错的设备-边缘协作系统。传统方法关注比特级传输正确性，在动态信道条件下效率低下。

Result: 在STM32平台上使用三个模型和六个数据集进行广泛实验，结果表明在不同传输错误率下，SemanticNN显著减少特征传输量56.82-344.83倍，同时保持优越的推理精度。

Conclusion: SemanticNN在严格的计算和通信约束下，通过语义级容错方法有效解决了物联网设备-边缘协作中的资源限制和网络不可靠问题，实现了高效的推理卸载。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), integrating artificial intelligence (AI) on extremely weak embedded devices has garnered significant attention, enabling improved real-time performance and enhanced data privacy. However, the resource limitations of such devices and unreliable network conditions necessitate error-resilient device-edge collaboration systems. Traditional approaches focus on bit-level transmission correctness, which can be inefficient under dynamic channel conditions. In contrast, we propose SemanticNN, a semantic codec that tolerates bit-level errors in pursuit of semantic-level correctness, enabling compressive and resilient collaborative inference offloading under strict computational and communication constraints. It incorporates a Bit Error Rate (BER)-aware decoder that adapts to dynamic channel conditions and a Soft Quantization (SQ)-based encoder to learn compact representations. Building on this architecture, we introduce Feature-augmentation Learning, a novel training strategy that enhances offloading efficiency. To address encoder-decoder capability mismatches from asymmetric resources, we propose XAI-based Asymmetry Compensation to enhance decoding semantic fidelity. We conduct extensive experiments on STM32 using three models and six datasets across image classification and object detection tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that, under varying transmission error rates, SemanticNN significantly reduces feature transmission volume by 56.82-344.83x while maintaining superior inference accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出H²ARN网络解决文本-3D检索中的层次表示崩溃和冗余诱导显著性稀释问题，通过在双曲空间中嵌入数据和设计层次排序损失，并发布扩展的T3DR-HIT v2基准数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前文本-3D检索方法面临的两个主要挑战：层次表示崩溃（HRC）将抽象到具体和整体到部分的层次结构压缩在欧几里得嵌入中，以及冗余诱导显著性稀释（RISD）平均噪声片段，模糊关键语义线索。

Method: H²ARN在Lorentz模型双曲空间中嵌入文本和3D数据，利用指数体积增长保持层次距离。使用层次排序损失构建收缩蕴含锥，确保匹配的3D实例落在锥内，同时实例级对比损失强制与非匹配样本分离。针对RISD，提出贡献感知双曲聚合模块，利用Lorentz距离评估局部特征相关性并进行贡献加权聚合。

Result: 发布了扩展的T3DR-HIT v2基准数据集，包含8,935个文本-3D对，是原始大小的2.6倍，涵盖细粒度文化文物和复杂室内场景。

Conclusion: H²ARN通过双曲空间嵌入和层次对齐推理有效解决了文本-3D检索中的层次表示崩溃和冗余诱导显著性稀释问题，为3D数据检索提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: With the daily influx of 3D data on the internet, text-3D retrieval has gained increasing attention. However, current methods face two major challenges: Hierarchy Representation Collapse (HRC) and Redundancy-Induced Saliency Dilution (RISD). HRC compresses abstract-to-specific and whole-to-part hierarchies in Euclidean embeddings, while RISD averages noisy fragments, obscuring critical semantic cues and diminishing the model's ability to distinguish hard negatives. To address these challenges, we introduce the Hyperbolic Hierarchical Alignment Reasoning Network (H$^{2}$ARN) for text-3D retrieval. H$^{2}$ARN embeds both text and 3D data in a Lorentz-model hyperbolic space, where exponential volume growth inherently preserves hierarchical distances. A hierarchical ordering loss constructs a shrinking entailment cone around each text vector, ensuring that the matched 3D instance falls within the cone, while an instance-level contrastive loss jointly enforces separation from non-matching samples. To tackle RISD, we propose a contribution-aware hyperbolic aggregation module that leverages Lorentzian distance to assess the relevance of each local feature and applies contribution-weighted aggregation guided by hyperbolic geometry, enhancing discriminative regions while suppressing redundancy without additional supervision. We also release the expanded T3DR-HIT v2 benchmark, which contains 8,935 text-to-3D pairs, 2.6 times the original size, covering both fine-grained cultural artefacts and complex indoor scenes. Our codes are available at https://github.com/liwrui/H2ARN.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PINGS-X是一种基于轴对齐时空高斯表示的新型4D流MRI超分辨率框架，通过归一化高斯渲染、轴对齐高斯和合并策略，显著减少训练时间并提升超分辨率精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D流MRI需要高时空分辨率来早期检测心血管疾病，但高分辨率会导致扫描时间过长。现有基于PINNs的方法训练缓慢且需为每个患者单独训练，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出PINGS-X框架，采用轴对齐时空高斯表示，包括：归一化高斯渲染（具有收敛保证）、轴对齐高斯（简化高维数据训练）、高斯合并程序（防止退化解并提升计算效率）。

Result: 在计算流体动力学和真实4D流MRI数据集上的实验表明，PINGS-X显著减少训练时间，同时实现更优的超分辨率精度。

Conclusion: PINGS-X通过创新的高斯表示方法，有效解决了4D流MRI超分辨率中的训练效率问题，为临床应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a reliable, non-invasive approach for estimating blood flow velocities, vital for cardiovascular diagnostics. Unlike conventional MRI focused on anatomical structures, 4D flow MRI requires high spatiotemporal resolution for early detection of critical conditions such as stenosis or aneurysms. However, achieving such resolution typically results in prolonged scan times, creating a trade-off between acquisition speed and prediction accuracy. Recent studies have leveraged physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for super-resolution of MRI data, but their practical applicability is limited as the prohibitively slow training process must be performed for each patient. To overcome this limitation, we propose PINGS-X, a novel framework modeling high-resolution flow velocities using axes-aligned spatiotemporal Gaussian representations. Inspired by the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) in novel view synthesis, PINGS-X extends this concept through several non-trivial novel innovations: (i) normalized Gaussian splatting with a formal convergence guarantee, (ii) axes-aligned Gaussians that simplify training for high-dimensional data while preserving accuracy and the convergence guarantee, and (iii) a Gaussian merging procedure to prevent degenerate solutions and boost computational efficiency. Experimental results on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and real 4D flow MRI datasets demonstrate that PINGS-X substantially reduces training time while achieving superior super-resolution accuracy. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/SpatialAILab/PINGS-X.

*Chuheng Chen,Xiaofei Zhou,Geyuan Zhang,Yong Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了NP-LoRA框架，通过零空间投影解决LoRA融合中的结构干扰问题，实现更好的主题保真度和风格一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LoRA融合方法依赖权重合并，导致一个LoRA主导另一个，产生干扰和保真度下降。这种干扰是结构性的，因为单独训练的LoRA占据低秩高维子空间，导致非正交和重叠的表示。

Method: 分析LoRA内部结构，发现生成行为由低秩子空间中的少数主方向主导。提出NP-LoRA框架：通过奇异值分解提取主风格方向，然后将主题LoRA投影到其正交零空间中。引入软投影机制来控制主题保真度和风格一致性之间的权衡。

Result: 实验表明NP-LoRA在融合质量上持续优于强基线（如DINO和CLIP指标，以及人类和LLM偏好分数），并且无需重新训练即可广泛应用于各种骨干网络和LoRA对。

Conclusion: NP-LoRA通过强制子空间分离有效防止了主方向之间的结构干扰，为可控生成提供了更高质量的LoRA融合解决方案。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fusion has emerged as a key technique for reusing and composing learned subject and style representations for controllable generation without costly retraining. However, existing methods rely on weight-based merging, where one LoRA often dominates the other, leading to interference and degraded fidelity. This interference is structural: separately trained LoRAs occupy low-rank high-dimensional subspaces, leading to non-orthogonal and overlapping representations. In this work, we analyze the internal structure of LoRAs and find their generative behavior is dominated by a few principal directions in the low-rank subspace, which should remain free from interference during fusion. To achieve this, we propose Null Space Projection LoRA (NP-LoRA), a projection-based framework for LoRA fusion that enforces subspace separation to prevent structural interference among principal directions. Specifically, we first extract principal style directions via singular value decomposition (SVD) and then project the subject LoRA into its orthogonal null space. Furthermore, we introduce a soft projection mechanism that enables smooth control over the trade-off between subject fidelity and style consistency. Experiments show NP-LoRA consistently improves fusion quality over strong baselines (e.g., DINO and CLIP-based metrics, with human and LLM preference scores), and applies broadly across backbones and LoRA pairs without retraining.

Motivation: 现有生成式图像合成方法在同时保持细节和调整前景姿态/视角方面存在困难

Method: 扩展生成式合成模型为多参考版本，使用任意数量的前景参考图像，并校准参考图像的全局和局部特征以兼容背景信息

Result: 在MVImgNet和MureCom数据集上的实验表明，校准后的参考特征能显著提升生成模型性能

Conclusion: 多参考图像和特征校准能有效改善生成式图像合成的质量和灵活性

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert foreground object into background. Despite the huge progress in generative image composition, the existing methods are still struggling with simultaneous detail preservation and foreground pose/view adjustment. To address this issue, we extend the existing generative composition model to multi-reference version, which allows using arbitrary number of foreground reference images. Furthermore, we propose to calibrate the global and local features of foreground reference images to make them compatible with the background information. The calibrated reference features can supplement the original reference features with useful global and local information of proper pose/view. Extensive experiments on MVImgNet and MureCom demonstrate that the generative model can greatly benefit from the calibrated reference features.

TL;DR: LiteAttention利用扩散注意力在去噪步骤间的时间相干性，通过早期标记非重要tile并传播跳过决策，在保持质量的同时显著加速视频扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散变换器在视频生成中面临二次注意力复杂度的瓶颈，动态稀疏注意力方法计算开销大且存在估计误差，而静态稀疏模式在整个去噪过程中固定且通常次优。

Method: 利用扩散注意力稀疏模式在去噪步骤间的时间相干性，提出LiteAttention方法，通过进化计算跳过机制，早期标记非重要tile并传播跳过决策，避免重复分析开销。

Result: 在FlashAttention基础上实现高度优化的LiteAttention内核，在量产视频扩散模型上实现显著加速，且无质量损失。

Conclusion: LiteAttention结合了动态方法的适应性和静态方法的效率，通过利用时间相干性有效消除冗余注意力计算。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers, particularly for video generation, achieve remarkable quality but suffer from quadratic attention complexity, leading to prohibitive latency. Existing acceleration methods face a fundamental trade-off: dynamically estimating sparse attention patterns at each denoising step incurs high computational overhead and estimation errors, while static sparsity patterns remain fixed and often suboptimal throughout denoising. We identify a key structural property of diffusion attention, namely, its sparsity patterns exhibit strong temporal coherence across denoising steps. Tiles deemed non-essential at step $t$ typically remain so at step $t+δ$. Leveraging this observation, we introduce LiteAttention, a method that exploits temporal coherence to enable evolutionary computation skips across the denoising sequence. By marking non-essential tiles early and propagating skip decisions forward, LiteAttention eliminates redundant attention computations without repeated profiling overheads, combining the adaptivity of dynamic methods with the efficiency of static ones. We implement a highly optimized LiteAttention kernel on top of FlashAttention and demonstrate substantial speedups on production video diffusion models, with no degradation in quality. The code and implementation details will be publicly released.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) remains a leading cause of preventable blindness, with early detection critical for reducing vision loss worldwide. Over the past decade, deep learning has transformed DR screening, progressing from early convolutional neural networks trained on private datasets to advanced pipelines addressing class imbalance, label scarcity, domain shift, and interpretability. This survey provides the first systematic synthesis of DR research spanning 2016-2025, consolidating results from 50+ studies and over 20 datasets. We critically examine methodological advances, including self- and semi-supervised learning, domain generalization, federated training, and hybrid neuro-symbolic models, alongside evaluation protocols, reporting standards, and reproducibility challenges. Benchmark tables contextualize performance across datasets, while discussion highlights open gaps in multi-center validation and clinical trust. By linking technical progress with translational barriers, this work outlines a practical agenda for reproducible, privacy-preserving, and clinically deployable DR AI. Beyond DR, many of the surveyed innovations extend broadly to medical imaging at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的放射学报告生成方法主要依赖标准监督微调范式进行图像-文本对实例级对齐，但无法建立解剖学基础的对齐，导致生成质量不理想。

Method: 采用浅到深策略：从粗粒度放射图像-报告配对开始，引入参考报告进行实例级指导，最后使用关键短语在特定解剖细节上建立基础。通过基于记忆的适配器实现特征共享。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR和IU X-Ray基准测试中达到最先进性能，消融研究验证了多阶段辅助引导方法的有效性。

Conclusion: S2D-Align为增强复杂多模态生成任务中的基础能力提供了一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) aims to automatically generate diagnostic reports from radiology images. To achieve this, existing methods have leveraged the powerful cross-modal generation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), primarily focusing on optimizing cross-modal alignment between radiographs and reports through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, by only performing instance-level alignment with the image-text pairs, the standard SFT paradigm fails to establish anatomically-grounded alignment, where the templated nature of reports often leads to sub-optimal generation quality. To address this, we propose \textsc{S2D-Align}, a novel SFT paradigm that establishes anatomically-grounded alignment by leveraging auxiliary signals of varying granularities. \textsc{S2D-Align} implements a shallow-to-deep strategy, progressively enriching the alignment process: it begins with the coarse radiograph-report pairing, then introduces reference reports for instance-level guidance, and ultimately utilizes key phrases to ground the generation in specific anatomical details. To bridge the different alignment stages, we introduce a memory-based adapter that empowers feature sharing, thereby integrating coarse and fine-grained guidance. For evaluation, we conduct experiments on the public \textsc{MIMIC-CXR} and \textsc{IU X-Ray} benchmarks, where \textsc{S2D-Align} achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our multi-stage, auxiliary-guided approach, highlighting a promising direction for enhancing grounding capabilities in complex, multi-modal generation tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然生成模型在3D数据等模态中广泛应用，但哪种模型最适合特定任务尚无共识。条件信息（如文本和图像）被广泛使用，但部分3D数据等条件信息尚未得到充分评估。

Method: 比较了两种最有前景的生成模型——去噪扩散概率模型和自回归因果变换器，将它们适配用于生成形状建模和补全任务。进行了全面的定量评估，包括基线判别模型和广泛的消融研究。

Result: 结果显示：（1）具有连续潜在空间的扩散模型在从单个噪声深度图像进行多模态形状补全任务中表现优于判别模型和自回归方法，达到最先进性能；（2）在相同离散潜在空间中，自回归模型能够匹配或超过扩散模型在这些任务上的性能。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在连续潜在空间中表现最佳，而自回归模型在离散潜在空间中也能达到竞争性性能，为不同应用场景下的模型选择提供了指导。

Abstract: While generative models have seen significant adoption across a wide range of data modalities, including 3D data, a consensus on which model is best suited for which task has yet to be reached. Further, conditional information such as text and images to steer the generation process are frequently employed, whereas others, like partial 3D data, have not been thoroughly evaluated. In this work, we compare two of the most promising generative models--Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models and Autoregressive Causal Transformers--which we adapt for the tasks of generative shape modeling and completion. We conduct a thorough quantitative evaluation and comparison of both tasks, including a baseline discriminative model and an extensive ablation study. Our results show that (1) the diffusion model with continuous latents outperforms both the discriminative model and the autoregressive approach and delivers state-of-the-art performance on multi-modal shape completion from a single, noisy depth image under realistic conditions and (2) when compared on the same discrete latent space, the autoregressive model can match or exceed diffusion performance on these tasks.

Abstract: Estimating the geometric and volumetric properties of transparent deformable liquids is challenging due to optical complexities and dynamic surface deformations induced by container movements. Autonomous robots performing precise liquid manipulation tasks, such as dispensing, aspiration, and mixing, must handle containers in ways that inevitably induce these deformations, complicating accurate liquid state assessment. Current datasets lack comprehensive physics-informed simulation data representing realistic liquid behaviors under diverse dynamic scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Phys-Liquid, a physics-informed dataset comprising 97,200 simulation images and corresponding 3D meshes, capturing liquid dynamics across multiple laboratory scenes, lighting conditions, liquid colors, and container rotations. To validate the realism and effectiveness of Phys-Liquid, we propose a four-stage reconstruction and estimation pipeline involving liquid segmentation, multi-view mask generation, 3D mesh reconstruction, and real-world scaling. Experimental results demonstrate improved accuracy and consistency in reconstructing liquid geometry and volume, outperforming existing benchmarks. The dataset and associated validation methods facilitate future advancements in transparent liquid perception tasks.

Conclusion: SaTformer通过视频变换器架构和分类方法有效解决了极端降水预测问题，为AI天气预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Meteorological agencies around the world rely on real-time flood guidance to issue live-saving advisories and warnings. For decades traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have been state-of-the-art for precipitation forecasting. However, physically-parameterized models suffer from a few core limitations: first, solving PDEs to resolve atmospheric dynamics is computationally demanding, and second, these methods degrade in performance at nowcasting timescales (i.e., 0-4 hour lead-times). Motivated by these shortcomings, recent work proposes AI-weather prediction (AI-WP) alternatives that learn to emulate analysis data with neural networks. While these data-driven approaches have enjoyed enormous success across diverse spatial and temporal resolutions, applications of video-understanding architectures for weather forecasting remain underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose SaTformer: a video transformer built on full space-time attention that skillfully forecasts extreme precipitation from satellite radiances. Along with our novel architecture, we introduce techniques to tame long-tailed precipitation datasets. Namely, we reformulate precipitation regression into a classification problem, and employ a class-weighted loss to address label imbalances. Our model scored first place on the NeurIPS Weather4Cast 2025 Cumulative Rainfall challenge. Code and model weights are available: https://github.com/leharris3/satformer

TL;DR: 本研究首次系统评估了数字重建放射影像（DRR）作为冠状动脉钙化（CAC）检测的替代训练域，通过生成合成DRR图像并测试不同训练策略，证明了DRR可作为CXR检测CAC的可行替代方案。


<details>

Conclusion: DRR为CAC检测提供了可扩展的标签丰富基础，为未来向真实CXR的迁移学习和领域适应奠定了基础。

Abstract: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events, with CT-based Agatston scoring widely regarded as the clinical gold standard. However, CT is costly and impractical for large-scale screening, while chest X-rays (CXRs) are inexpensive but lack reliable ground truth labels, constraining deep learning development. Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) offer a scalable alternative by projecting CT volumes into CXR-like images while inheriting precise labels. In this work, we provide the first systematic evaluation of DRRs as a surrogate training domain for CAC detection. Using 667 CT scans from the COCA dataset, we generate synthetic DRRs and assess model capacity, super-resolution fidelity enhancement, preprocessing, and training strategies. Lightweight CNNs trained from scratch outperform large pretrained networks; pairing super-resolution with contrast enhancement yields significant gains; and curriculum learning stabilises training under weak supervision. Our best configuration achieves a mean AUC of 0.754, comparable to or exceeding prior CXR-based studies. These results establish DRRs as a scalable, label-rich foundation for CAC detection, while laying the foundation for future transfer learning and domain adaptation to real CXRs.

Motivation: 树皮甲虫侵染对针叶林健康构成严重威胁，需要有效的监测方法。传统方法在标记数据有限的情况下效果不佳，因此需要开发少样本学习方法。

Method: 使用对比学习框架预训练一维CNN编码器，从PRISMA高光谱数据中提取鲁棒特征，然后训练支持向量回归器估计每个像素中健康、受攻击和死亡树木的比例。

Result: 在Dolomites研究区域的实验表明，该方法优于使用原始PRISMA光谱波段和Sentinel-2数据的方法。

Conclusion: PRISMA高光谱数据与少样本学习相结合，为森林健康监测提供了显著优势。

Abstract: Bark beetle infestations represent a serious challenge for maintaining the health of coniferous forests. This paper proposes a few-shot learning approach leveraging contrastive learning to detect bark beetle infestations using satellite PRISMA hyperspectral data. The methodology is based on a contrastive learning framework to pre-train a one-dimensional CNN encoder, enabling the extraction of robust feature representations from hyperspectral data. These extracted features are subsequently utilized as input to support vector regression estimators, one for each class, trained on few labeled samples to estimate the proportions of healthy, attacked by bark beetle, and dead trees for each pixel. Experiments on the area of study in the Dolomites show that our method outperforms the use of original PRISMA spectral bands and of Sentinel-2 data. The results indicate that PRISMA hyperspectral data combined with few-shot learning offers significant advantages for forest health monitoring.

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), a two-stage framework consisting of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results on improving reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs). Yet extending RFT to large video language models (LVLMs) remains challenging. We propose VideoP2R, a novel process-aware video RFT framework that enhances video reasoning by modeling perception and reasoning as distinct processes. In the SFT stage, we develop a three-step pipeline to generate VideoP2R-CoT-162K, a high-quality, process-aware chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for perception and reasoning. In the RL stage, we introduce a novel process-aware group relative policy optimization (PA-GRPO) algorithm that supplies separate rewards for perception and reasoning. Extensive experiments show that VideoP2R achieves state-of-the-art (SotA) performance on six out of seven video reasoning and understanding benchmarks. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our process-aware modeling and PA-GRPO and demonstrate that model's perception output is information-sufficient for downstream reasoning.

Abstract: Vectorized glyphs are widely used in poster design, network animation, art display, and various other fields due to their scalability and flexibility. In typography, they are often seen as special sequences composed of ordered strokes. This concept extends to the token sequence prediction abilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling vectorized character generation through stroke modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel Large Vectorized Glyph Model (LVGM) designed to generate vectorized Chinese glyphs by predicting the next stroke. Initially, we encode strokes into discrete latent variables called stroke embeddings. Subsequently, we train our LVGM via fine-tuning DeepSeek LLM by predicting the next stroke embedding. With limited strokes given, it can generate complete characters, semantically elegant words, and even unseen verses in vectorized form. Moreover, we release a new large-scale Chinese SVG dataset containing 907,267 samples based on strokes for dynamically vectorized glyph generation. Experimental results show that our model has scaling behaviors on data scales. Our generated vectorized glyphs have been validated by experts and relevant individuals.

<details>

Motivation: 现有KBVQA方法要么使用MLLMs的隐式知识，要么使用检索增强生成，但缺乏显式的多步推理轨迹。需要激发MLLMs的内部知识推理能力。

Method: 1) 通过提示冻结的7B规模MLLM构建Hindsight-Zero训练数据；2) 自蒸馏为CoT生成器和知识生成器；3) 使用KEPO优化知识生成器，偏好低置信度但有用的知识；4) 利用生成的CoT和知识进行答案预测。

Result: 在OK-VQA和A-OKVQA数据集上的实验验证了HinD的有效性，仅使用7B规模MLLM就能达到优越性能，无需商业模型API或外部知识。

Conclusion: HinD框架成功激发了MLLMs的内部知识推理能力，通过后见之明蒸馏和知识鼓励偏好优化，在KBVQA任务中实现了高效的知识推理。

Abstract: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KBVQA) necessitates external knowledge incorporation beyond cross-modal understanding. Existing KBVQA methods either utilize implicit knowledge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) via in-context learning or explicit knowledge via retrieval augmented generation. However, their reasoning processes remain implicit, without explicit multi-step trajectories from MLLMs. To address this gap, we provide a Hindsight Distilled Reasoning (HinD) framework with Knowledge Encouragement Preference Optimization (KEPO), designed to elicit and harness internal knowledge reasoning ability in MLLMs. First, to tackle the reasoning supervision problem, we propose to emphasize the hindsight wisdom of MLLM by prompting a frozen 7B-size MLLM to complete the reasoning process between the question and its ground truth answer, constructing Hindsight-Zero training data. Then we self-distill Hindsight-Zero into Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Generator and Knowledge Generator, enabling the generation of sequential steps and discrete facts. Secondly, to tackle the misalignment between knowledge correctness and confidence, we optimize the Knowledge Generator with KEPO, preferring under-confident but helpful knowledge over the over-confident but unhelpful one. The generated CoT and sampled knowledge are then exploited for answer prediction. Experiments on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA validate the effectiveness of HinD, showing that HinD with elicited reasoning from 7B-size MLLM achieves superior performance without commercial model APIs or outside knowledge.

TL;DR: OT-ALD是一种基于最优传输理论的图像到图像翻译框架，解决了DDIB方法中存在的翻译效率低和潜在分布不匹配问题，在保持循环一致性的同时显著提升了翻译速度和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DDIB方法虽然能保持循环一致性，但面临翻译效率低和潜在分布不匹配导致的翻译轨迹偏差问题。

Method: 通过计算源域和目标域潜在分布之间的最优传输映射，将映射后的分布作为目标域反向扩散过程的起点，从而消除潜在分布不匹配。

Result: 在三个高分辨率数据集的四个翻译任务上，OT-ALD相比最佳基线模型平均提升采样效率20.29%，FID分数降低2.6。

Conclusion: OT-ALD有效平衡了快速图像翻译与图像质量，消除了潜在分布不匹配问题，是一种高效的图像翻译框架。

Abstract: The Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridge (DDIB) is an emerging image-to-image (I2I) translation method that preserves cycle consistency while achieving strong flexibility. It links two independently trained diffusion models (DMs) in the source and target domains by first adding noise to a source image to obtain a latent code, then denoising it in the target domain to generate the translated image. However, this method faces two key challenges: (1) low translation efficiency, and (2) translation trajectory deviations caused by mismatched latent distributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel I2I translation framework, OT-ALD, grounded in optimal transport (OT) theory, which retains the strengths of DDIB-based approach. Specifically, we compute an OT map from the latent distribution of the source domain to that of the target domain, and use the mapped distribution as the starting point for the reverse diffusion process in the target domain. Our error analysis confirms that OT-ALD eliminates latent distribution mismatches. Moreover, OT-ALD effectively balances faster image translation with improved image quality. Experiments on four translation tasks across three high-resolution datasets show that OT-ALD improves sampling efficiency by 20.29% and reduces the FID score by 2.6 on average compared to the top-performing baseline models.

Conclusion: 混响变换具有作为通用延迟建模方法的潜力，能够实现可控的轨迹预测并揭示智能体的延迟行为模式。

Abstract: Bridging the past to the future, connecting agents both spatially and temporally, lies at the core of the trajectory prediction task. Despite great efforts, it remains challenging to explicitly learn and predict latencies, the temporal delays with which agents respond to different trajectory-changing events and adjust their future paths, whether on their own or interactively. Different agents may exhibit distinct latency preferences for noticing, processing, and reacting to any specific trajectory-changing event. The lack of consideration of such latencies may undermine the causal continuity of the forecasting system and also lead to implausible or unintended trajectories. Inspired by the reverberation curves in acoustics, we propose a new reverberation transform and the corresponding Reverberation (short for Rev) trajectory prediction model, which simulates and predicts different latency preferences of each agent as well as their stochasticity by using two explicit and learnable reverberation kernels, allowing for the controllable trajectory prediction based on these forecasted latencies. Experiments on multiple datasets, whether pedestrians or vehicles, demonstrate that Rev achieves competitive accuracy while revealing interpretable latency dynamics across agents and scenarios. Qualitative analyses further verify the properties of the proposed reverberation transform, highlighting its potential as a general latency modeling approach.

TL;DR: MultiTypeFCDD是一个轻量级卷积框架，用于可解释的多类型异常检测，无需为每个对象类别训练单独模型，显著降低了计算资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释异常检测方法无法区分异常类型，且需要为每个对象类别训练和维护单独模型，计算成本高。大型视觉语言模型虽然能解决此问题，但计算密集且内存占用大，不适合实时或嵌入式系统。

Method: 使用仅图像级标签学习并生成多通道热图，每个通道对应特定异常类型。作为统一框架，能够跨多个对象类别区分异常类型。

Result: 在Real-IAD数据集上评估，结果与最先进复杂模型相当，但参数负载和推理时间显著减少。

Conclusion: MultiTypeFCDD为计算资源受限的实际应用提供了高度实用和可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Most explainable anomaly detection methods often identify anomalies but lack the capability to differentiate the type of anomaly. Furthermore, they often require the costly training and maintenance of separate models for each object category. The lack of specificity is a significant research gap, as identifying the type of anomaly (e.g., "Crack" vs. "Scratch") is crucial for accurate diagnosis that facilitates cost-saving operational decisions across diverse application domains. While some recent large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have begun to address this, they are computationally intensive and memory-heavy, restricting their use in real-time or embedded systems. We propose MultiTypeFCDD, a simple and lightweight convolutional framework designed as a practical alternative for explainable multi-type anomaly detection. MultiTypeFCDD uses only image-level labels to learn and produce multi-channel heatmaps, where each channel is trained to correspond to a specific anomaly type. The model functions as a single, unified framework capable of differentiating anomaly types across multiple object categories, eliminating the need to train and manage separate models for each object category. We evaluated our proposed method on the Real-IAD dataset and it delivers results competitive with state-of-the-art complex models at significantly reduced parametric load and inference times. This makes it a highly practical and viable solution for real-world applications where computational resources are tightly constrained.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) cooperative perception has great potential to enhance autonomous driving performance by overcoming perception limitations in complex adverse traffic scenarios (CATS). Meanwhile, data serves as the fundamental infrastructure for modern autonomous driving AI. However, due to stringent data collection requirements, existing datasets focus primarily on ordinary traffic scenarios, constraining the benefits of cooperative perception. To address this challenge, we introduce CATS-V2V, the first-of-its-kind real-world dataset for V2V cooperative perception under complex adverse traffic scenarios. The dataset was collected by two hardware time-synchronized vehicles, covering 10 weather and lighting conditions across 10 diverse locations. The 100-clip dataset includes 60K frames of 10 Hz LiDAR point clouds and 1.26M multi-view 30 Hz camera images, along with 750K anonymized yet high-precision RTK-fixed GNSS and IMU records. Correspondingly, we provide time-consistent 3D bounding box annotations for objects, as well as static scenes to construct a 4D BEV representation. On this basis, we propose a target-based temporal alignment method, ensuring that all objects are precisely aligned across all sensor modalities. We hope that CATS-V2V, the largest-scale, most supportive, and highest-quality dataset of its kind to date, will benefit the autonomous driving community in related tasks.

Conclusion: AlignVQA框架通过多智能体辩论和校准感知损失函数有效改善了VQA系统的置信度校准，使其置信度更准确地反映实际预测性能。

Abstract: In the context of Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Agentic AI, calibration refers to how closely an AI system's confidence in its answers reflects their actual correctness. This aspect becomes especially important when such systems operate autonomously and must make decisions under visual uncertainty. While modern VQA systems, powered by advanced vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used in high-stakes domains like medical diagnostics and autonomous navigation due to their improved accuracy, the reliability of their confidence estimates remains under-examined. Particularly, these systems often produce overconfident responses. To address this, we introduce AlignVQA, a debate-based multi-agent framework, in which diverse specialized VLM -- each following distinct prompting strategies -- generate candidate answers and then engage in two-stage interaction: generalist agents critique, refine and aggregate these proposals. This debate process yields confidence estimates that more accurately reflect the model's true predictive performance. We find that more calibrated specialized agents produce better aligned confidences. Furthermore, we introduce a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss function called aligncal designed to fine-tune the specialized agents by minimizing an upper bound on the calibration error. This objective explicitly improves the fidelity of each agent's confidence estimates. Empirical results across multiple benchmark VQA datasets substantiate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating substantial reductions in calibration discrepancies. Furthermore, we propose a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss to fine-tune the specialized agents and improve the quality of their individual confidence estimates based on minimising upper bound calibration error.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中多视角视频常因相机触发延迟或独立录制设置导致时序不同步，影响4D高斯溅射的重建质量。

Method: 采用粗到精对齐模块，先估计帧级粗偏移，再细化为亚帧精度，可作为即插即用模块集成到现有4DGS框架中。

Result: 实验表明该方法能有效处理时序未对齐视频，显著提升基线方法性能。

Conclusion: 该方法增强了4DGS框架处理异步数据的鲁棒性，实现了高质量的多视角视频重建。

Abstract: Multi-view video reconstruction plays a vital role in computer vision, enabling applications in film production, virtual reality, and motion analysis. While recent advances such as 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in dynamic scene reconstruction, they typically rely on the assumption that input video streams are temporally synchronized. However, in real-world scenarios, this assumption often fails due to factors like camera trigger delays or independent recording setups, leading to temporal misalignment across views and reduced reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, a novel temporal alignment strategy is proposed for high-quality 4DGS reconstruction from unsynchronized multi-view videos. Our method features a coarse-to-fine alignment module that estimates and compensates for each camera's time shift. The method first determines a coarse, frame-level offset and then refines it to achieve sub-frame accuracy. This strategy can be integrated as a readily integrable module into existing 4DGS frameworks, enhancing their robustness when handling asynchronous data. Experiments show that our approach effectively processes temporally misaligned videos and significantly enhances baseline methods.

Conclusion: Viper-F1通过状态空间模型和视觉定位增强，在保持线性时间推理的同时实现了高效的细粒度视觉语言理解，为资源受限场景提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled impressive progress in vision-language understanding, yet their high computational cost limits deployment in resource-constrained scenarios such as robotic manipulation, personal assistants, and smart cameras. Most existing methods rely on Transformer-based cross-attention, whose quadratic complexity hinders efficiency. Moreover, small vision-language models often struggle to precisely capture fine-grained, task-relevant visual regions, leading to degraded performance on fine-grained reasoning tasks that limit their effectiveness in the real world. To address these issues, we introduce Viper-F1, a Hybrid State-Space Vision-Language Model that replaces attention with efficient Liquid State-Space Dynamics. To further enhance visual grounding, we propose a Token-Grid Correlation Module, which computes lightweight correlations between text tokens and image patches and modulates the state-space dynamics via FiLM conditioning. This enables the model to selectively emphasize visual regions relevant to the textual prompt while maintaining linear-time inference. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Viper-F1 achieves accurate, fine-grained understanding with significantly improved efficiency.

The proposed approach leverages analysis fields from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) Global Atmospheric Composition Forecasts at 0.4 degree resolution. A 256x256 spatial region, covering 28.4S-73.6N and 32E-134.0E, is used as the model input, while predictions are generated for the central 128x128 area spanning 2.8S-48N and 57.6E-108.4E, ensuring an India-centric forecast domain with sufficient synoptic-scale context. Models are trained on CAMS analyses from 2021-2023 using a shuffled 90/10 split and independently evaluated on 2024 data. Three lightweight parameter-specific architectures are developed to improve accuracy, minimize systematic bias, and enable rapid inference. Evaluation using RMSE, MAE, Bias, and SSIM demonstrates substantial performance gains over the Aurora foundation model, underscoring the effectiveness of compact & specialized deep learning models for short-range forecasts on limited spatial domains.

Abstract: This study presents a transfer-learning framework based on Convolutional Gated Recurrent Units (ConvGRU) for short-term rainfall prediction in the Weather4Cast 2025 competition. A single SEVIRI infrared channel (10.8 μm wavelength) is used as input, which consists of four observations over a one-hour period. A two-stage training strategy is applied to generate rainfall estimates up to four hours ahead. In the first stage, ConvGRU is trained to forecast the brightness temperatures from SEVIRI, enabling the model to capture relevant spatiotemporal patterns. In the second stage, an empirically derived nonlinear transformation maps the predicted fields to OPERA-compatible rainfall rates.
  For the event-prediction task, the transformed rainfall forecasts are processed using 3D event detection followed by spatiotemporal feature extraction to identify and characterize precipitation events. Our submission achieved 2nd place in the cumulative rainfall task. Further, the same model was used out-of-the-box for the event prediction task, and resulted in similar scores as the baseline model to the competition.

Abstract: Geospatial chain of thought (CoT) reasoning is essential for advancing Visual Question Answering (VQA) on satellite imagery, particularly in climate related applications such as disaster monitoring, infrastructure risk assessment, urban resilience planning, and policy support. Existing VQA models enable scalable interpretation of remote sensing data but often lack the structured reasoning required for complex geospatial queries. We propose a VQA framework that integrates CoT reasoning with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to improve interpretability, robustness, and accuracy. By generating intermediate rationales, the model better handles tasks involving detection, classification, spatial relations, and comparative analysis, which are critical for reliable decision support in high stakes climate domains. Experiments show that CoT supervision improves accuracy by 34.9\% over direct baselines, while DPO yields additional gains in accuracy and reasoning quality. The resulting system advances VQA for multispectral Earth observation by enabling richer geospatial reasoning and more effective climate use cases.

### [68] [Questioning the Stability of Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11206)
*Amir Rosenfeld,Neta Glazer,Ethan Fetaya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文首次大规模系统研究了VLM对良性视觉和文本扰动的鲁棒性，发现现代VLM对微小扰动高度敏感，且样本稳定性是正确性的强指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型取得了显著进展，但其在保持语义不变的小输入变化下的可靠性仍未被充分理解，需要系统评估其鲁棒性。

Method: 通过像素级偏移、轻微几何变换、填充缩放、改写和多语言重写等不改变语义的扰动，在多种模型和数据集上进行大规模测试。

Result: 现代VLM对微小扰动高度敏感，即使是GPT-4o、Gemini 2.0 Flash等最先进系统也经常在几个像素的偏移或无害改写下失败。样本稳定性与正确性高度相关。

Conclusion: 当前VLM存在基本脆弱性，需要超越对抗性扰动的鲁棒性评估，重点关注模型应可靠保持的不变性。

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their reliability under small, meaning-preserving input changes remains poorly understood. We present the first large-scale, systematic study of VLM robustness to benign visual and textual perturbations: pixel-level shifts, light geometric transformations, padded rescaling, paraphrasing, and multilingual rewrites that do not alter the underlying semantics of an image-question pair. Across a broad set of models and datasets, we find that modern VLMs are highly sensitive to such minor perturbations: a substantial fraction of samples change their predicted answer under at least one visual or textual modification. We characterize how this instability varies across perturbation types, question categories, and models, revealing that even state-of-the-art systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash) frequently fail under shifts as small as a few pixels or harmless rephrasings. We further show that sample-level stability serves as a strong indicator of correctness: stable samples are consistently far more likely to be answered correctly. Leveraging this, we demonstrate that the stability patterns of small, accessible open-source models can be used to predict the correctness of much larger closed-source models with high precision. Our findings expose a fundamental fragility in current VLMs and highlight the need for robustness evaluations that go beyond adversarial perturbations, focusing instead on invariances that models should reliably uphold.

TL;DR: 提出了首个3D视觉中的一对多后门攻击框架，基于可配置的球形触发器，允许单个触发器设计编码多个目标类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D点云后门攻击仅限于僵化的一对一范式，无法应对安全敏感的3D领域（如自动驾驶和机器人）中的多目标威胁。

Method: 利用球体的空间特性作为参数空间，通过可配置的球形触发器实现一对多后门攻击，使中毒模型能将不同的触发器配置映射到不同的目标标签。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型架构上系统验证了该方法的有效性，攻击成功率高达100%，同时保持对干净数据的准确性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为3D视觉中的多目标威胁建立了关键基准，并为保护未来3D驱动的智能系统提供了基础理解。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks represent a critical threat to deep learning systems, particularly in safety-sensitive 3D domains such as autonomous driving and robotics. However, existing backdoor attacks for 3D point clouds have been limited to a rigid one-to-one paradigm. To address this, we present the first one-to-N backdoor framework for 3D vision, based on a novel, configurable spherical trigger. Our key insight is to leverage the spatial properties of spheres as a parameter space, allowing a single trigger design to encode multiple target classes. We establish a theoretical foundation for one-to-N backdoor attacks in 3D, demonstrating that poisoned models can map distinct trigger configurations to different target labels. Experimental results systematically validate this conclusion across multiple datasets and model architectures, achieving high attack success rates (up to 100\%) while maintaining accuracy on clean data. This work establishes a crucial benchmark for multi-target threats in 3D vision and provides the foundational understanding needed to secure future 3D-driven intelligent systems.

TL;DR: MAFM^3是一个模块化框架，让单个基础模型通过轻量级模块组件扩展到医学影像的多个领域、任务和模态，实现高效的多任务多模态适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像领域数据稀缺，为每个领域、模态或任务单独预训练模型具有挑战性。需要一种统一且可扩展的方法来适应多任务多模态需求。

Method: 通过轻量级模块化组件扩展单个基础模型，这些组件作为专门技能集，在推理时根据输入类型或临床目标灵活激活相应能力。

Result: 在胸部CT基础模型上验证，适应预后和分割模块后性能均有提升。整合PET扫描后，Dice分数比基线提高5%。

Conclusion: 配备模块化组件的基础模型不受初始训练范围限制，可以演变为医学影像的多任务多模态系统。

Abstract: Foundational models are trained on extensive datasets to capture the general trends of a domain. However, in medical imaging, the scarcity of data makes pre-training for every domain, modality, or task challenging. Instead of building separate models, we propose MAFM^3 (Modular Adaptation of Foundation Models for Multi-Modal Medical AI), a framework that enables a single foundation model to expand into diverse domains, tasks, and modalities through lightweight modular components. These components serve as specialized skill sets that allow the system to flexibly activate the appropriate capability at the inference time, depending on the input type or clinical objective. Unlike conventional adaptation methods that treat each new task or modality in isolation, MAFM^3 provides a unified and expandable framework for efficient multitask and multimodality adaptation. Empirically, we validate our approach by adapting a chest CT foundation model initially trained for classification into prognosis and segmentation modules. Our results show improved performance on both tasks. Furthermore, by incorporating PET scans, MAFM^3 achieved an improvement in the Dice score 5% compared to the respective baselines. These findings establish that foundation models, when equipped with modular components, are not inherently constrained to their initial training scope but can evolve into multitask, multimodality systems for medical imaging.

Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅在稀疏训练视角下容易过拟合，缺乏中间视角监督

Method: 基于分数蒸馏采样，提出指导分数蒸馏框架，结合深度扭曲引导和语义图像特征引导，修正视频扩散模型的噪声预测

Result: 在多个数据集上优于现有方法

Conclusion: GSD框架有效利用视频扩散模型的先验知识，提升稀疏视角下3D高斯泼溅的表示质量

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained great attention in the 3D scene representation for its high-quality real-time rendering capabilities. However, when the input comprises sparse training views, 3DGS is prone to overfitting, primarily due to the lack of intermediate-view supervision. Inspired by the recent success of Video Diffusion Models (VDM), we propose a framework called Guidance Score Distillation (GSD) to extract the rich multi-view consistency priors from pretrained VDMs. Building on the insights from Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), GSD supervises rendered images from multiple neighboring views, guiding the Gaussian splatting representation towards the generative direction of VDM. However, the generative direction often involves object motion and random camera trajectories, making it challenging for direct supervision in the optimization process. To address this problem, we introduce an unified guidance form to correct the noise prediction result of VDM. Specifically, we incorporate both a depth warp guidance based on real depth maps and a guidance based on semantic image features, ensuring that the score update direction from VDM aligns with the correct camera pose and accurate geometry. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches across multiple datasets.

Result: 多模态模型中普遍存在位置偏差，文本编码器偏向输入开头，图像编码器在开头和结尾都表现出偏差。

Conclusion: 多模态模型中的位置偏差由位置编码方案、训练损失、上下文重要性以及图像-文本对的使用等多种因素共同导致或放大。

Abstract: Positional bias - where models overemphasize certain positions regardless of content - has been shown to negatively impact model performance across various tasks. While recent research has extensively examined positional bias in text generation models, its presence and effects in representation models remain underexplored. Even less is known about such biases in multimodal models. In this work, we investigate positional bias in multimodal representation models, specifically in the context of image-text retrieval. We begin by distinguishing between context importance and positional bias, and then assess the presence and extent of positional bias across different models and datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that positional bias is prevalent in multimodal models, but manifests differently across modalities: text encoders tend to exhibit bias toward the beginning of the input, whereas image encoders show bias at both the beginning and end. Furthermore, we find that this bias arises from, or is amplified by, a combination of factors, including the positional encoding scheme, training loss, context importance, and the nature of using image-text pairs in multimodal training.

TL;DR: DiT-Gaze是一个基于扩散变换器的高保真视线重定向框架，通过弱监督和正交约束损失提升3D视线重定向模型的性能，在感知质量和重定向精度上达到新SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯溅射模型在渲染细微连续视线变化时存在困难，需要更高保真的视线重定向方法来生成增强数据以提升视线估计器的泛化能力。

Method: 结合扩散变换器(DiT)、跨视线角度的弱监督策略和正交约束损失，DiT实现高保真图像合成，弱监督提供平滑的视线方向流形，正交约束损失数学上强制视线、头部姿态和表情表示的分离。

Result: DiT-Gaze在感知质量和重定向精度上均达到新SOTA，将当前最佳视线误差降低了4.1%至6.353度，为创建合成训练数据提供了优越方法。

Conclusion: DiT-Gaze通过创新的DiT结合、弱监督和正交约束损失，显著提升了视线重定向的保真度和准确性，为视线估计研究提供了高质量的数据生成工具。

Abstract: High-fidelity gaze redirection is critical for generating augmented data to improve the generalization of gaze estimators. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models like GazeGaussian represent the state-of-the-art but can struggle with rendering subtle, continuous gaze shifts. In this paper, we propose DiT-Gaze, a framework that enhances 3D gaze redirection models using a novel combination of Diffusion Transformer (DiT), weak supervision across gaze angles, and an orthogonality constraint loss. DiT allows higher-fidelity image synthesis, while our weak supervision strategy using synthetically generated intermediate gaze angles provides a smooth manifold of gaze directions during training. The orthogonality constraint loss mathematically enforces the disentanglement of internal representations for gaze, head pose, and expression. Comprehensive experiments show that DiT-Gaze sets a new state-of-the-art in both perceptual quality and redirection accuracy, reducing the state-of-the-art gaze error by 4.1% to 6.353 degrees, providing a superior method for creating synthetic training data. Our code and models will be made available for the research community to benchmark against.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D深度学习在多领域泛化受限，主要由于数据集规模有限和多源点云异质性高，不同传感器采集的点云在密度和噪声分布上存在显著差异，导致多领域融合时出现负迁移。

Method: DoReMi框架包含：1）领域感知专家分支，通过领域引导空间路由动态激活；2）统一表示分支，通过多属性自监督学习预训练；3）熵控制动态分配机制确保专家稳定高效利用。

Result: 在多个3D理解基准测试中表现优异，ScanNet Val上达到80.1% mIoU，S3DIS上达到77.2% mIoU，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DoReMi展示了作为未来3D理解研究基础框架的强大潜力，能够自适应建模多样化领域分布，同时保持跨领域几何和结构先验。

Abstract: The generalization of 3D deep learning across multiple domains remains limited by the limited scale of existing datasets and the high heterogeneity of multi-source point clouds. Point clouds collected from different sensors (e.g., LiDAR scans and mesh-derived point clouds) exhibit substantial discrepancies in density and noise distribution, resulting in negative transfer during multi-domain fusion. Most existing approaches focus exclusively on either domain-aware or domain-general features, overlooking the potential synergy between them. To address this, we propose DoReMi (Domain-Representation Mixture), a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that jointly models Domain-aware Experts branch and a unified Representation branch to enable cooperative learning between specialized and generalizable knowledge. DoReMi dynamically activates domain-aware expert branch via Domain-Guided Spatial Routing (DSR) for context-aware expert selection and employs Entropy-Controlled Dynamic Allocation (EDA) for stable and efficient expert utilization, thereby adaptively modeling diverse domain distributions. Complemented by a frozen unified representation branch pretrained through robust multi-attribute self-supervised learning, DoReMi preserves cross-domain geometric and structural priors while maintaining global consistency. We evaluate DoReMi across multiple 3D understanding benchmarks. Notably, DoReMi achieves 80.1% mIoU on ScanNet Val and 77.2% mIoU on S3DIS, demonstrating competitive or superior performance compared to existing approaches, and showing strong potential as a foundation framework for future 3D understanding research. The code will be released soon.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在显著减少LoRA参数量的情况下，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的MoE LoRA框架能够有效解决小样本风格编辑问题，在参数效率和性能方面都表现出色。

Abstract: In recent years, image editing has garnered growing attention. However, general image editing models often fail to produce satisfactory results when confronted with new styles. The challenge lies in how to effectively fine-tune general image editing models to new styles using only a limited amount of paired data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel few-shot style editing framework. For this task, we construct a benchmark dataset that encompasses five distinct styles. Correspondingly, we propose a parameter-efficient multi-style Mixture-of-Experts Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE LoRA) with style-specific and style-shared routing mechanisms for jointly fine-tuning multiple styles. The style-specific routing ensures that different styles do not interfere with one another, while the style-shared routing adaptively allocates shared MoE LoRAs to learn common patterns. Our MoE LoRA can automatically determine the optimal ranks for each layer through a novel metric-guided approach that estimates the importance score of each single-rank component. Additionally, we explore the optimal location to insert LoRA within the Diffusion in Transformer (DiT) model and integrate adversarial learning and flow matching to guide the diffusion training process. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches with significantly fewer LoRA parameters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过分组caption tokens来获取细粒度视觉语言表示的方法，将语言表示与图像中的对象对齐，提升模型对视觉和语言的细粒度理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型主要通过对齐图像块和语言token来获取细粒度知识，但图像块对人眼无意义，单个token也不一定携带可接地的图像信息。需要更自然的语言分组来表示场景的不同方面。

Method: 提出一种模型架构，在训练过程中自动分组caption tokens，并将这些分组表示与经过对象发现训练的图像编码器输出对齐，以获得对象级别的细粒度表示。

Result: 通过学习token分组，视觉语言模型获得了更好的细粒度理解能力，模型发现的token分组与文本中的可接地短语高度相似，定性和定量分析都证实了这一点。

Conclusion: 通过token分组的方法能够有效捕获语言的细粒度表示，提升视觉语言模型对真实世界的理解能力，且发现的分组与人类可理解的概念高度一致。

Abstract: Fine-grained knowledge is crucial for vision-language models to obtain a better understanding of the real world. While there has been work trying to acquire this kind of knowledge in the space of vision and language, it has mostly focused on aligning the image patches with the tokens on the language side. However, image patches do not have any meaning to the human eye, and individual tokens do not necessarily carry groundable information in the image. It is groups of tokens which describe different aspects of the scene. In this work, we propose a model which groups the caption tokens as part of its architecture in order to capture a fine-grained representation of the language. We expect our representations to be at the level of objects present in the image, and therefore align our representations with the output of an image encoder trained to discover objects. We show that by learning to group the tokens, the vision-language model has a better fine-grained understanding of vision and language. In addition, the token groups that our model discovers are highly similar to groundable phrases in text, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

TL;DR: GEODE是一个解决视觉语言模型3D空间理解瓶颈的新架构，通过解耦3D推理和数值生成，在1.5B参数下达到与7B+模型相当的3D空间推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型基于"平面"感知架构，难以理解真实世界的3D空间智能，存在输入阶段几何感知编码器计算成本高与2D特征浅层的冲突，以及输出阶段离散分词器无法生成精确连续数值的对齐问题。

Method: 引入GEODE架构，包含两个即插即用模块：解耦推理模块(DRM)作为空间协处理器，通过交叉注意力对齐3D数据与2D视觉特征，并将空间思维链逻辑蒸馏为可注入的推理标记；直接回归头(DRH)采用"嵌入即值"范式，将专用控制标记路由到轻量MLP进行精确连续回归。

Result: 1.5B参数模型作为高级语义分发器，实现了最先进的3D空间推理性能，可与7B+模型相媲美。

Conclusion: GEODE通过解耦3D推理和数值生成的双重瓶颈，为视觉语言模型提供了有效的3D空间理解解决方案。

Abstract: Existing Vision Language Models (VLMs) architecturally rooted in "flatland" perception, fundamentally struggle to comprehend real-world 3D spatial intelligence. This failure stems from a dual-bottleneck: input-stage conflict between computationally exorbitant geometric-aware encoders and superficial 2D-only features, and output-stage misalignment where discrete tokenizers are structurally incapable of producing precise, continuous numerical values. To break this impasse, we introduce GEODE (Geometric-Output and Decoupled-Input Engine), a novel architecture that resolves this dual-bottleneck by decoupling 3D reasoning from numerical generation. GEODE augments main VLM with two specialized, plug-and-play modules: Decoupled Rationale Module (DRM) that acts as spatial co-processor, aligning explicit 3D data with 2D visual features via cross-attention and distilling spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) logic into injectable Rationale Tokens; and Direct Regression Head (DRH), an "Embedding-as-Value" paradigm which routes specialized control tokens to a lightweight MLP for precise, continuous regression of scalars and 3D bounding boxes. The synergy of these modules allows our 1.5B parameter model to function as a high-level semantic dispatcher, achieving state-of-the-art spatial reasoning performance that rivals 7B+ models.

TL;DR: Arcee提出了一种跨块循环状态链，通过重用每个块的终端状态空间表示作为下一块的初始条件，显著改进了视觉Mamba模型在无条件生成任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Mamba选择性扫描操作在每个块中重新初始化状态空间动态，丢弃了前一个块的终端状态空间表示，这限制了模型的信息传递能力。

Method: Arcee构建了一个可微分的边界映射，将每个块的终端状态空间表示作为下一块的初始条件，实现了跨块的端到端梯度流动。

Result: 在CelebA-HQ（256×256）的无条件生成任务中，Arcee将FID从82.81显著降低到15.33（降低了5.4倍）。

Conclusion: Arcee提供了一种参数免费、成本可忽略的改进方法，与所有现有视觉Mamba变体兼容，将终端状态空间表示视为因果传递产生的温和方向性先验。

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs), Mamba in particular, are increasingly adopted for long-context sequence modeling, providing linear-time aggregation via an input-dependent, causal selective-scan operation. Along this line, recent "Mamba-for-vision" variants largely explore multiple scan orders to relax strict causality for non-sequential signals (e.g., images). Rather than preserving cross-block memory, the conventional formulation of the selective-scan operation in Mamba reinitializes each block's state-space dynamics from zero, discarding the terminal state-space representation (SSR) from the previous block. Arcee, a cross-block recurrent state chain, reuses each block's terminal state-space representation as the initial condition for the next block. Handoff across blocks is constructed as a differentiable boundary map whose Jacobian enables end-to-end gradient flow across terminal boundaries. Key to practicality, Arcee is compatible with all prior "vision-mamba" variants, parameter-free, and incurs constant, negligible cost. As a modeling perspective, we view terminal SSR as a mild directional prior induced by a causal pass over the input, rather than an estimator of the non-sequential signal itself. To quantify the impact, for unconditional generation on CelebA-HQ (256$\times$256) with Flow Matching, Arcee reduces FID$\downarrow$ from $82.81$ to $15.33$ ($5.4\times$ lower) on a single scan-order Zigzag Mamba baseline. Efficient CUDA kernels and training code will be released to support rigorous and reproducible research.

Abstract: The automatic detection of gaze targets in autistic children through artificial intelligence can be impactful, especially for those who lack access to a sufficient number of professionals to improve their quality of life. This paper introduces a new, real-world AI application for gaze target detection in autistic children, which predicts a child's point of gaze from an activity image. This task is foundational for building automated systems that can measure joint attention-a core challenge in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). To facilitate the study of this challenging application, we collected the first-ever Autism Gaze Target (AGT) dataset. We further propose a novel Socially Aware Coarse-to-Fine (SACF) gaze detection framework that explicitly leverages the social context of a scene to overcome the class imbalance common in autism datasets-a consequence of autistic children's tendency to show reduced gaze to faces. It utilizes a two-pathway architecture with expert models specialized in social and non-social gaze, guided by a context-awareness gate module. The results of our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance for gaze target detection in this population, significantly outperforming existing methods, especially on the critical minority class of face-directed gaze.

Motivation: 传统的视觉语言模型微调过程容易受到偏见、错误和分布不平衡的影响，导致过拟合和性能不均衡。现有方法在控制分布偏见和标注质量方面存在不足。

Method: 重新设计微调过程：1) 控制数据生成和标注，确保无偏见、分布平衡和无标注错误；2) 通过全面采样对象属性（颜色、形状、大小、位置）自动构建数据集；3) 使用该数据集微调最先进的视觉语言模型。

Result: 实验表明：1) 在平衡合成数据上微调能在整个视觉场景中产生均匀性能并减轻常见偏见；2) 在合成刺激上微调显著提高了在真实世界数据（COCO）上的性能，优于在匹配设置下微调的模型。

Conclusion: 通过控制合成数据生成过程可以解决传统微调中的偏见和分布不平衡问题，这种方法不仅能改善模型在合成数据上的性能，还能有效迁移到真实世界数据上。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is a common strategy to improve performance following an ad-hoc data collection and annotation of real-world scenes. However, this process is often prone to biases, errors, and distribution imbalance, resulting in overfitting and imbalanced performance. Although a few studies have tried to address this problem by generating synthetic data, they lacked control over distribution bias and annotation quality. To address these challenges, we redesign the fine-tuning process in two ways. First, we control the generation of data and its annotations, ensuring it is free from bias, distribution imbalance, and annotation errors. We automatically construct the dataset by comprehensively sampling objects' attributes, including color, shape, size, and position within the scene. Secondly, using this annotated dataset, we fine-tune state-of-the-art VLMs and assess performance transferability to real-world data on the absolute position task. We conduct exhaustive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: 1) fine-tuning on balanced synthetic data yields uniform performance across the visual scene and mitigates common biases; and 2) fine-tuning on synthetic stimuli significantly improves performance on real-world data (COCO), outperforming models fine-tuned in the matched setting.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models generate realistic and coherent images but often fail to follow numerical instructions in text, revealing a gap between language and visual representation. Interestingly, we found that these models are not entirely blind to numbers-they are implicitly aware of their own counting accuracy, as their internal signals shift in consistent ways depending on whether the output meets the specified count. This observation suggests that the model already encodes a latent notion of numerical correctness, which can be harnessed to guide generation more precisely. Building on this intuition, we introduce CountSteer, a training-free method that improves generation of specified object counts by steering the model's cross-attention hidden states during inference. In our experiments, CountSteer improved object-count accuracy by about 4% without compromising visual quality, demonstrating a simple yet effective step toward more controllable and semantically reliable text-to-image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DocLens是一个工具增强的多智能体框架，通过"放大"证据来解决长视觉文档理解中的证据定位问题，在MMLongBench-Doc和FinRAGBench-V上达到最先进性能。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长视觉文档理解中存在证据定位的根本挑战，难以检索相关页面并忽略视觉元素中的细粒度细节，导致性能有限和模型幻觉。

Method: 提出DocLens框架，首先从完整文档导航到相关页面上的特定视觉元素，然后采用采样-裁决机制生成单一可靠答案。

Result: 与Gemini-2.5-Pro配对，DocLens在MMLongBench-Doc和FinRAGBench-V上超越人类专家，达到最先进性能，在视觉中心和不可回答查询上表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: DocLens通过增强的定位能力展示了其优势，特别是在视觉中心和不可回答查询上，证明了其强大的证据定位能力。

Abstract: Comprehending long visual documents, where information is distributed across extensive pages of text and visual elements, is a critical but challenging task for modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Existing approaches falter on a fundamental challenge: evidence localization. They struggle to retrieve relevant pages and overlook fine-grained details within visual elements, leading to limited performance and model hallucination. To address this, we propose DocLens, a tool-augmented multi-agent framework that effectively ``zooms in'' on evidence like a lens. It first navigates from the full document to specific visual elements on relevant pages, then employs a sampling-adjudication mechanism to generate a single, reliable answer. Paired with Gemini-2.5-Pro, DocLens achieves state-of-the-art performance on MMLongBench-Doc and FinRAGBench-V, surpassing even human experts. The framework's superiority is particularly evident on vision-centric and unanswerable queries, demonstrating the power of its enhanced localization capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于交通场景图的关系监督方法，通过将场景图序列化并整合到语言驱动模型中，显著提升了自动驾驶规划性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在自动驾驶规划中缺乏对空间结构和动态交互关系进行显式监督训练，限制了其从原始传感器数据推断交通实体间相互影响的能力。

Method: 开发了一种模型无关的方法，通过结构化提示模板将不同抽象层次和格式的交通场景图整合到基于语言的驾驶模型中。

Result: 在LangAuto基准测试中，场景图条件化使最先进方法的驾驶性能大幅提升，LMDrive驾驶得分提高15.6%，BEVDriver提高17.5%。

Conclusion: 即使测试时不需要场景图输入，模型也能通过场景图条件化训练更好地内化和基于关系先验知识，证明了关系监督在自动驾驶规划中的重要性。

Abstract: Vision-language models have recently emerged as promising planners for autonomous driving, where success hinges on topology-aware reasoning over spatial structure and dynamic interactions from multimodal input. However, existing models are typically trained without supervision that explicitly encodes these relational dependencies, limiting their ability to infer how agents and other traffic entities influence one another from raw sensor data. In this work, we bridge this gap with a novel model-agnostic method that conditions language-based driving models on structured relational context in the form of traffic scene graphs. We serialize scene graphs at various abstraction levels and formats, and incorporate them into the models via structured prompt templates, enabling a systematic analysis of when and how relational supervision is most beneficial. Extensive evaluations on the public LangAuto benchmark show that scene graph conditioning of state-of-the-art approaches yields large and persistent improvement in driving performance. Notably, we observe up to a 15.6\% increase in driving score for LMDrive and 17.5\% for BEVDriver, indicating that models can better internalize and ground relational priors through scene graph-conditioned training, even without requiring scene graph input at test-time. Code, fine-tuned models, and our scene graph dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/iis-esslingen/GraphPilot.

Abstract: Foundation models have emerged as effective backbones for many vision tasks. However, current self-supervised features entangle high-level semantics with low-level physical factors, such as geometry and illumination, hindering their use in tasks requiring explicit physical reasoning. In this paper, we introduce $Φ$eat, a novel physically-grounded visual backbone that encourages a representation sensitive to material identity, including reflectance cues and geometric mesostructure. Our key idea is to employ a pretraining strategy that contrasts spatial crops and physical augmentations of the same material under varying shapes and lighting conditions. While similar data have been used in high-end supervised tasks such as intrinsic decomposition or material estimation, we demonstrate that a pure self-supervised training strategy, without explicit labels, already provides a strong prior for tasks requiring robust features invariant to external physical factors. We evaluate the learned representations through feature similarity analysis and material selection, showing that $Φ$eat captures physically-grounded structure beyond semantic grouping. These findings highlight the promise of unsupervised physical feature learning as a foundation for physics-aware perception in vision and graphics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用硬二元阈值定义正负样本，丢弃了连续的解剖相似性信息，且忽略了全局解剖进展的方向一致性，导致特征空间扭曲无法捕捉跨患者的规范解剖流形。

Method: CORAL采用对比排序目标利用连续解剖相似性，确保切片间特征距离与其解剖位置差异成比例；同时引入序数目标强制全局方向一致性，使学习特征分布与跨患者规范解剖进展对齐。

Result: 在有限标注设置下的基准数据集上达到最先进性能，学习到具有有意义的解剖结构的表示。

Conclusion: 通过协调学习框架，CORAL能够学习解剖信息丰富的表示，显著提升下游分割任务的性能。

Abstract: Volumetric medical image segmentation presents unique challenges due to the inherent anatomical structure and limited availability of annotations. While recent methods have shown promise by contrasting spatial relationships between slices, they rely on hard binary thresholds to define positive and negative samples, thereby discarding valuable continuous information about anatomical similarity. Moreover, these methods overlook the global directional consistency of anatomical progression, resulting in distorted feature spaces that fail to capture the canonical anatomical manifold shared across patients. To address these limitations, we propose Coordinative Ordinal-Relational Anatomical Learning (CORAL) to capture both local and global structure in volumetric images. First, CORAL employs a contrastive ranking objective to leverage continuous anatomical similarity, ensuring relational feature distances between slices are proportional to their anatomical position differences. In addition, CORAL incorporates an ordinal objective to enforce global directional consistency, aligning the learned feature distribution with the canonical anatomical progression across patients. Learning these inter-slice relationships produces anatomically informed representations that benefit the downstream segmentation task. Through this coordinative learning framework, CORAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets under limited-annotation settings while learning representations with meaningful anatomical structure.

TL;DR: D-GAP是一种在幅度空间和像素空间进行目标增强的方法，通过频率敏感度映射和像素级混合来提升模型在域外数据上的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实计算机视觉应用中域外鲁棒性挑战，传统增强方法在图像背景、风格和采集设备变化时效果不一致，神经网络对域特定频率分量存在学习偏差。

Method: 提出D-GAP方法，在频率空间中计算任务梯度的敏感度映射，自适应插值源和目标样本的幅度，同时在像素空间进行混合以恢复空间细节。

Result: 在四个真实世界数据集和三个域适应基准测试中，D-GAP始终优于通用和数据集特定增强方法，真实世界数据集平均OOD性能提升+5.3%，基准数据集提升+1.8%。

Conclusion: D-GAP通过频率和像素空间的双重增强有效减轻了模型的学习偏差，显著提升了域外鲁棒性。

Abstract: Out-of-domain (OOD) robustness is challenging to achieve in real-world computer vision applications, where shifts in image background, style, and acquisition instruments always degrade model performance. Generic augmentations show inconsistent gains under such shifts, whereas dataset-specific augmentations require expert knowledge and prior analysis. Moreover, prior studies show that neural networks adapt poorly to domain shifts because they exhibit a learning bias to domain-specific frequency components. Perturbing frequency values can mitigate such bias but overlooks pixel-level details, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these problems, we propose D-GAP (Dataset-agnostic and Gradient-guided augmentation in Amplitude and Pixel spaces), improving OOD robustness by introducing targeted augmentation in both the amplitude space (frequency space) and pixel space. Unlike conventional handcrafted augmentations, D-GAP computes sensitivity maps in the frequency space from task gradients, which reflect how strongly the model responds to different frequency components, and uses the maps to adaptively interpolate amplitudes between source and target samples. This way, D-GAP reduces the learning bias in frequency space, while a complementary pixel-space blending procedure restores fine spatial details. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets and three domain-adaptation benchmarks show that D-GAP consistently outperforms both generic and dataset-specific augmentations, improving average OOD performance by +5.3% on real-world datasets and +1.8% on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Gaze redirection methods aim to generate realistic human face images with controllable eye movement. However, recent methods often struggle with 3D consistency, efficiency, or quality, limiting their practical applications. In this work, we propose RTGaze, a real-time and high-quality gaze redirection method. Our approach learns a gaze-controllable facial representation from face images and gaze prompts, then decodes this representation via neural rendering for gaze redirection. Additionally, we distill face geometric priors from a pretrained 3D portrait generator to enhance generation quality. We evaluate RTGaze both qualitatively and quantitatively, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in efficiency, redirection accuracy, and image quality across multiple datasets. Our system achieves real-time, 3D-aware gaze redirection with a feedforward network (~0.06 sec/image), making it 800x faster than the previous state-of-the-art 3D-aware methods.

Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的水印方法依赖于手工噪声模拟层训练，这限制了它们对未知失真的泛化能力。AIGC的发展需要能够抵抗传统信号处理和新型语义编辑攻击的鲁棒图像水印。

Method: 利用图像低频分量对多种攻击的显著鲁棒性，将水印直接嵌入到低频分量的深度特征空间中，使用预训练的变分自编码器将水印与结构稳定的图像表示绑定。

Conclusion: SimuFreeMark通过消除训练过程中的噪声模拟需求，提供了一种更通用的水印解决方案，在鲁棒性和视觉质量方面都表现出色。

Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) has created a pressing need for robust image watermarking that can withstand both conventional signal processing and novel semantic editing attacks. Current deep learning-based methods rely on training with hand-crafted noise simulation layers, which inherently limit their generalization to unforeseen distortions. In this work, we propose $\textbf{SimuFreeMark}$, a noise-$\underline{\text{simu}}$lation-$\underline{\text{free}}$ water$\underline{\text{mark}}$ing framework that circumvents this limitation by exploiting the inherent stability of image low-frequency components. We first systematically establish that low-frequency components exhibit significant robustness against a wide range of attacks. Building on this foundation, SimuFreeMark embeds watermarks directly into the deep feature space of the low-frequency components, leveraging a pre-trained variational autoencoder (VAE) to bind the watermark with structurally stable image representations. This design completely eliminates the need for noise simulation during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimuFreeMark outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a wide range of conventional and semantic attacks, while maintaining superior visual quality.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型训练数据常包含敏感或受版权保护内容，需要遵守'被遗忘权'法规，但视觉概念遗忘研究不足，主要挑战是如何精确移除目标概念而不影响相关实体。

Method: 提出AUVIC框架，使用对抗性扰动技术实现精确遗忘，有效隔离目标概念并避免对相似实体的意外影响。

Result: 实验结果表明AUVIC在目标遗忘率方面达到最先进水平，同时对非目标概念的性能影响最小。

Conclusion: AUVIC成功解决了MLLMs中视觉概念遗忘的挑战，为数据隐私保护提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve impressive performance once optimized on massive datasets. Such datasets often contain sensitive or copyrighted content, raising significant data privacy concerns. Regulatory frameworks mandating the 'right to be forgotten' drive the need for machine unlearning. This technique allows for the removal of target data without resource-consuming retraining. However, while well-studied for text, visual concept unlearning in MLLMs remains underexplored. A primary challenge is precisely removing a target visual concept without disrupting model performance on related entities. To address this, we introduce AUVIC, a novel visual concept unlearning framework for MLLMs. AUVIC applies adversarial perturbations to enable precise forgetting. This approach effectively isolates the target concept while avoiding unintended effects on similar entities. To evaluate our method, we construct VCUBench. It is the first benchmark designed to assess visual concept unlearning in group contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that AUVIC achieves state-of-the-art target forgetting rates while incurs minimal performance degradation on non-target concepts.

Abstract: Automated and selective harvesting of fruits has become an important area of research, particularly due to challenges such as high costs and a shortage of seasonal labor in advanced economies. This paper focuses on 6D pose estimation of strawberries using purely synthetic data generated through a procedural pipeline for photorealistic rendering. We employ the YOLOX-6D-Pose algorithm, a single-shot approach that leverages the YOLOX backbone, known for its balance between speed and accuracy, and its support for edge inference. To address the lacking availability of training data, we introduce a robust and flexible pipeline for generating synthetic strawberry data from various 3D models via a procedural Blender pipeline, where we focus on enhancing the realism of the synthesized data in comparison to previous work to make it a valuable resource for training pose estimation algorithms. Quantitative evaluations indicate that our models achieve comparable accuracy on both the NVIDIA RTX 3090 and Jetson Orin Nano across several ADD-S metrics, with the RTX 3090 demonstrating superior processing speed. However, the Jetson Orin Nano is particularly suited for resource-constrained environments, making it an excellent choice for deployment in agricultural robotics. Qualitative assessments further confirm the model's performance, demonstrating its capability to accurately infer the poses of ripe and partially ripe strawberries, while facing challenges in detecting unripe specimens. This suggests opportunities for future improvements, especially in enhancing detection capabilities for unripe strawberries (if desired) by exploring variations in color. Furthermore, the methodology presented could be adapted easily for other fruits such as apples, peaches, and plums, thereby expanding its applicability and impact in the field of agricultural automation.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong multimodal reasoning capabilities on long and complex documents. However, their high memory footprint makes them impractical for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. We present DocSLM, an efficient Small Vision-Language Model designed for long-document understanding under constrained memory resources. DocSLM incorporates a Hierarchical Multimodal Compressor that jointly encodes visual, textual, and layout information from each page into a fixed-length sequence, greatly reducing memory consumption while preserving both local and global semantics. To enable scalable processing over arbitrarily long inputs, we introduce a Streaming Abstention mechanism that operates on document segments sequentially and filters low-confidence responses using an entropy-based uncertainty calibrator. Across multiple long multimodal document benchmarks, DocSLM matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods while using 82\% fewer visual tokens, 75\% fewer parameters, and 71\% lower latency, delivering reliable multimodal document understanding on lightweight edge devices.

Result: 通过系统评估发现，具有线性衰减和双通道极性编码的时间表面在CNN推理中实现最佳姿态估计性能，显著优于指数衰减和单通道替代方案。极性信息对性能提升贡献最大，线性时间编码比指数衰减更有效地保留关键运动信息。

Conclusion: 该数据集以结构化格式提供原始事件流和预计算的最优表示，便于立即研究和可重复基准测试，填补了事件视觉领域合成数据资源的空白。

Abstract: We introduce YCB-Ev SD, a synthetic dataset of event-camera data at standard definition (SD) resolution for 6DoF object pose estimation. While synthetic data has become fundamental in frame-based computer vision, event-based vision lacks comparable comprehensive resources. Addressing this gap, we present 50,000 event sequences of 34 ms duration each, synthesized from Physically Based Rendering (PBR) scenes of YCB-Video objects following the Benchmark for 6D Object Pose (BOP) methodology. Our generation framework employs simulated linear camera motion to ensure complete scene coverage, including background activity.
  Through systematic evaluation of event representations for CNN-based inference, we demonstrate that time-surfaces with linear decay and dual-channel polarity encoding achieve superior pose estimation performance, outperforming exponential decay and single-channel alternatives by significant margins. Our analysis reveals that polarity information contributes most substantially to performance gains, while linear temporal encoding preserves critical motion information more effectively than exponential decay. The dataset is provided in a structured format with both raw event streams and precomputed optimal representations to facilitate immediate research use and reproducible benchmarking.

Motivation: 现有3D人体运动生成模型虽然重建精度高，但难以泛化到训练分布之外，这源于精确3D监督使模型过度拟合固定坐标模式而非学习本质的3D结构和运动语义线索。

Method: 提出Motion-Lifting Residual Quantized VAE (ML-RQ)将2D运动序列映射到3D一致潜在空间，并设计了一套3D无关正则化目标，包括视图一致性、方向连贯性和物理合理性约束。

Result: 完全在2D运动数据上训练的Free3D能生成多样化、时间连贯且语义对齐的3D运动，性能达到甚至超过完全3D监督的模型。

Conclusion: 放松显式3D监督能促进更强的结构推理和泛化能力，为3D运动生成提供了可扩展且数据高效的新范式。

Abstract: Recent 3D human motion generation models demonstrate remarkable reconstruction accuracy yet struggle to generalize beyond training distributions. This limitation arises partly from the use of precise 3D supervision, which encourages models to fit fixed coordinate patterns instead of learning the essential 3D structure and motion semantic cues required for robust generalization.To overcome this limitation, we propose Free3D, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D motions without any 3D motion annotations. Free3D introduces a Motion-Lifting Residual Quantized VAE (ML-RQ) that maps 2D motion sequences into 3D-consistent latent spaces, and a suite of 3D-free regularization objectives enforcing view consistency, orientation coherence, and physical plausibility. Trained entirely on 2D motion data, Free3D generates diverse, temporally coherent, and semantically aligned 3D motions, achieving performance comparable to or even surpassing fully 3D-supervised counterparts. These results suggest that relaxing explicit 3D supervision encourages stronger structural reasoning and generalization, offering a scalable and data-efficient paradigm for 3D motion generation.

Abstract: Extracting digital material representations from images is a necessary prerequisite for a quantitative analysis of material properties. Different segmentation approaches have been extensively studied in the past to achieve this task, but were often lacking accuracy or speed. With the advent of machine learning, supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance for different segmentation tasks. However, these models are often trained in a supervised manner, which requires large labeled datasets. Unsupervised approaches do not require ground-truth data for learning, but suffer from long segmentation times and often worse segmentation accuracy. Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRF) are an unsupervised segmentation approach that incorporates concepts of neighborhood and class distributions. We present a method that integrates HMRF theory and CNN segmentation, leveraging the advantages of both areas: unsupervised learning and fast segmentation times. We investigate the contribution of different neighborhood terms and components for the unsupervised HMRF loss. We demonstrate that the HMRF-UNet enables high segmentation accuracy without ground truth on a Micro-Computed Tomography ($μ$CT) image dataset of Polyurethane (PU) foam structures. Finally, we propose and demonstrate a pre-training strategy that considerably reduces the required amount of ground-truth data when training a segmentation model.

Conclusion: 验证了分层低秩稀疏建模在理解情感动态方面的有效性和通用性。

Abstract: Video-based Affective Computing (VAC), vital for emotion analysis and human-computer interaction, suffers from model instability and representational degradation due to complex emotional dynamics. Since the meaning of different emotional fluctuations may differ under different emotional contexts, the core limitation is the lack of a hierarchical structural mechanism to disentangle distinct affective components, i.e., emotional bases (the long-term emotional tone), and transient fluctuations (the short-term emotional fluctuations). To address this, we propose the Low-Rank Sparse Emotion Understanding Framework (LSEF), a unified model grounded in the Low-Rank Sparse Principle, which theoretically reframes affective dynamics as a hierarchical low-rank sparse compositional process. LSEF employs three plug-and-play modules, i.e., the Stability Encoding Module (SEM) captures low-rank emotional bases; the Dynamic Decoupling Module (DDM) isolates sparse transient signals; and the Consistency Integration Module (CIM) reconstructs multi-scale stability and reactivity coherence. This framework is optimized by a Rank Aware Optimization (RAO) strategy that adaptively balances gradient smoothness and sensitivity. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets confirm that LSEF significantly enhances robustness and dynamic discrimination, which further validates the effectiveness and generality of hierarchical low-rank sparse modeling for understanding affective dynamics.

TL;DR: MicroVQA++是一个三阶段构建的大规模高质量显微镜视觉问答数据集，通过专家验证、图网络过滤和人类筛选确保数据质量，使4B参数的多模态大模型在显微镜推理任务上达到接近GPT-5的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在生物医学图像分析中的应用受到大规模高质量训练数据稀缺的限制，特别是在显微镜图像的科学推理方面。

Method: 采用三阶段构建方法：1)从同行评审文章中获取专家验证的图-标题对；2)使用HiCQA-Graph异构图融合NLI文本蕴含、CLIP视觉语言对齐和智能体信号来过滤不一致样本；3)使用多模态大模型生成选择题并由人工筛选。

Conclusion: 精心构建的数据集能够显著提升小规模多模态大模型在专业领域的性能，证明了高质量数据对于生物医学图像分析的重要性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models are increasingly applied to biomedical imaging, yet scientific reasoning for microscopy remains limited by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. We introduce MicroVQA++, a three-stage, large-scale and high-quality microscopy VQA corpus derived from the BIOMEDICA archive. Stage one bootstraps supervision from expert-validated figure-caption pairs sourced from peer-reviewed articles. Stage two applies HiCQA-Graph, a novel heterogeneous graph over images, captions, and QAs that fuses NLI-based textual entailment, CLIP-based vision-language alignment, and agent signals to identify and filter inconsistent samples. Stage three uses a MultiModal Large Language Model (MLLM) agent to generate multiple-choice questions (MCQ) followed by human screening. The resulting release comprises a large training split and a human-checked test split whose Bloom's level hard-sample distribution exceeds the MicroVQA benchmark. Our work delivers (i) a quality-controlled dataset that couples expert literature with graph-based filtering and human refinement; (ii) HiCQA-Graph, the first graph that jointly models (image, caption, QA) for cross-modal consistency filtering; (iii) evidence that careful data construction enables 4B-scale MLLMs to reach competitive microscopy reasoning performance (e.g., GPT-5) and achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs. Code and dataset will be released after the review process concludes.

TL;DR: 提出了Q-Doc框架，系统评估多模态大语言模型在文档图像质量评估中的能力，发现MLLMs具有初步DIQA能力但存在评分不一致、失真识别错误等局限，而思维链提示能显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型的能力已扩展到高级视觉任务，但其在文档图像质量评估方面的潜力尚未充分探索，需要系统评估框架来填补这一空白。

Method: 提出三层次评估框架：粗粒度（质量评分）、中粒度（失真类型识别）、细粒度（失真严重程度评估），并使用思维链提示来增强性能。

Result: 评估显示MLLMs具有初步DIQA能力，但存在评分不一致、失真误识别和严重程度误判等关键局限，思维链提示能显著提升所有层次的表现。

Conclusion: 该工作为MLLMs的DIQA能力提供了基准，揭示了其在质量感知方面的明显缺陷，并指出了有前景的改进途径。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has expanded their capabilities beyond high-level vision tasks. Nevertheless, their potential for Document Image Quality Assessment (DIQA) remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose Q-Doc, a three-tiered evaluation framework for systematically probing DIQA capabilities of MLLMs at coarse, middle, and fine granularity levels. a) At the coarse level, we instruct MLLMs to assign quality scores to document images and analyze their correlation with Quality Annotations. b) At the middle level, we design distortion-type identification tasks, including single-choice and multi-choice tests for multi-distortion scenarios. c) At the fine level, we introduce distortion-severity assessment where MLLMs classify distortion intensity against human-annotated references. Our evaluation demonstrates that while MLLMs possess nascent DIQA abilities, they exhibit critical limitations: inconsistent scoring, distortion misidentification, and severity misjudgment. Significantly, we show that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting substantially enhances performance across all levels. Our work provides a benchmark for DIQA capabilities in MLLMs, revealing pronounced deficiencies in their quality perception and promising pathways for enhancement.

*Lan Li,Tao Hu,Da-Wei Zhou,Han-Jia Ye,De-Chuan Zhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BOFA是一个用于类增量学习的新框架，通过仅在CLIP的跨模态桥接层进行适配，无需额外参数，并利用正交低秩融合防止遗忘，结合跨模态混合原型提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将CLIP应用于类增量学习面临两个挑战：适配下游任务需要额外模块增加复杂度和遗忘风险；现有方法未能充分利用多模态表示的优势。

Method: BOFA框架：1) 仅在CLIP现有桥接层进行适配，不增加参数；2) 正交低秩融合机制，将参数更新约束在与过去任务特征正交的低秩安全子空间；3) 跨模态混合原型，结合稳定文本原型和视觉原型。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，BOFA相比现有方法实现了更优的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: BOFA通过桥接层正交融合适配，在类增量学习中实现了无数据回放的稳定知识积累和优越性能。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to continually learn new categories without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Vision-language models such as CLIP offer strong transferable representations via multi-modal supervision, making them promising for CIL. However, applying CLIP to CIL poses two major challenges: (1) adapting to downstream tasks often requires additional learnable modules, increasing model complexity and susceptibility to forgetting; and (2) while multi-modal representations offer complementary strengths, existing methods have yet to fully realize their potential in effectively integrating visual and textual modalities. To address these issues, we propose BOFA (Bridge-layer Orthogonal Fusion for Adaptation), a novel framework for CIL. BOFA confines all model adaptation exclusively to CLIP's existing cross-modal bridge-layer, thereby adding no extra parameters or inference cost. To prevent forgetting within this layer, it leverages Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion, a mechanism that constrains parameter updates to a low-rank ``safe subspace" mathematically constructed to be orthogonal to past task features. This ensures stable knowledge accumulation without data replay. Furthermore, BOFA employs a cross-modal hybrid prototype that synergizes stable textual prototypes with visual counterparts derived from our stably adapted bridge-layer, enhancing classification performance. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that BOFA achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.

*Lukun Wu,Jie Li,Ziqi Ren,Kaifan Zhang,Xinbo Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出自适应教学范式来解决视觉-脑电信号不对称对齐问题，通过让视觉模态调整其知识结构来匹配脑电模态的能力，在零样本脑到图像检索任务上达到60.2%的top-1准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉和脑电模态之间存在根本的不对称性，包括保真度差距（EEG噪声vs视觉高保真）和语义差距（EEG浅层概念vs视觉丰富语义）。传统方法忽视这种不对称性，强制对齐导致泛化能力差。

Method: 提出自适应教学范式，让'教师'模态（视觉）在任务指导下动态收缩和调整知识结构，使其语义密集特征匹配'学生'模态（EEG）的能力。实现为ShrinkAdapter模块，具有无残差设计和瓶颈结构。

Result: 在零样本脑到图像检索任务上达到60.2%的top-1准确率，比之前最优方法提升9.8%。

Conclusion: 为不对称对齐引入了新视角：教师必须收缩和适应来弥合视觉-脑电差距。

Abstract: Decoding visual features from EEG signals is a central challenge in neuroscience, with cross-modal alignment as the dominant approach. We argue that the relationship between visual and brain modalities is fundamentally asymmetric, characterized by two critical gaps: a Fidelity Gap (stemming from EEG's inherent noise and signal degradation, vs. vision's high-fidelity features) and a Semantic Gap (arising from EEG's shallow conceptual representation, vs. vision's rich semantic depth). Previous methods often overlook this asymmetry, forcing alignment between the two modalities as if they were equal partners and thereby leading to poor generalization. To address this, we propose the adaptive teaching paradigm. This paradigm empowers the ``teacher" modality (vision) to dynamically shrink and adjust its knowledge structure under task guidance, tailoring its semantically dense features to match the ``student" modality (EEG)'s capacity. We implement this paradigm with the ShrinkAdapter, a simple yet effective module featuring a residual-free design and a bottleneck structure. Through extensive experiments, we validate the underlying rationale and effectiveness of our paradigm. Our method achieves a top-1 accuracy of 60.2\% on the zero-shot brain-to-image retrieval task, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 9.8\%. Our work introduces a new perspective for asymmetric alignment: the teacher must shrink and adapt to bridge the vision-brain gap.

TL;DR: 构建了一个包含10种语言的多语言指代表达理解数据集，并提出了一种基于注意力锚定的神经网络架构，在保持多语言性能的同时实现了竞争力的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前指代表达理解研究主要集中于英语，但实际部署需求日益全球化，需要解决多语言场景下的视觉定位问题。

Method: 通过机器翻译和上下文增强扩展12个英语基准数据集，构建统一多语言数据集；提出基于多语言SigLIP2编码器的注意力锚定架构，通过注意力分布生成粗粒度空间锚点，再通过学习残差进行细化。

Result: 在RefCOCO多语言评估中达到86.9%的IoU@50准确率（英语单语为91.3%），多语言评估显示各语言间性能一致，证明了多语言视觉定位系统的可行性。

Conclusion: 成功构建了大规模多语言指代表达理解数据集，并开发了有效的多语言视觉定位模型，为全球化部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) requires models to localize objects in images based on natural language descriptions. Research on the area remains predominantly English-centric, despite increasing global deployment demands. This work addresses multilingual REC through two main contributions. First, we construct a unified multilingual dataset spanning 10 languages, by systematically expanding 12 existing English REC benchmarks through machine translation and context-based translation enhancement. The resulting dataset comprises approximately 8 million multilingual referring expressions across 177,620 images, with 336,882 annotated objects. Second, we introduce an attention-anchored neural architecture that uses multilingual SigLIP2 encoders. Our attention-based approach generates coarse spatial anchors from attention distributions, which are subsequently refined through learned residuals. Experimental evaluation demonstrates competitive performance on standard benchmarks, e.g. achieving 86.9% accuracy at IoU@50 on RefCOCO aggregate multilingual evaluation, compared to an English-only result of 91.3%. Multilingual evaluation shows consistent capabilities across languages, establishing the practical feasibility of multilingual visual grounding systems.

TL;DR: WEAVE是一个用于上下文交错跨模态理解和生成的首个套件，包含WEAVE-100k大规模数据集和WEAVEBench人工标注基准，旨在解决现有方法在多轮、上下文感知图像生成和编辑方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的统一多模态模型数据集和基准主要关注单轮交互，无法捕捉现实世界图像创建和编辑的多轮、上下文依赖特性。

Method: 提出WEAVE套件：WEAVE-100k包含100K交错样本，覆盖370K对话轮次和500K图像；WEAVEBench包含100个基于480张图像的任务，采用混合VLM评判器评估框架。

Result: 在WEAVE-100k上训练能够提升视觉理解、图像编辑和理解-生成协作能力，促进UMMs发展出新兴的视觉记忆能力。

Conclusion: WEAVE为研究上下文交错理解和生成提供了视角和基础，揭示了当前方法在多轮上下文感知图像生成和编辑方面的持续局限性和挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in unified multimodal models (UMMs) have enabled impressive progress in visual comprehension and generation. However, existing datasets and benchmarks focus primarily on single-turn interactions, failing to capture the multi-turn, context-dependent nature of real-world image creation and editing. To address this gap, we present WEAVE, the first suite for in-context interleaved cross-modality comprehension and generation. Our suite consists of two complementary parts. WEAVE-100k is a large-scale dataset of 100K interleaved samples spanning over 370K dialogue turns and 500K images, covering comprehension, editing, and generation tasks that require reasoning over historical context. WEAVEBench is a human-annotated benchmark with 100 tasks based on 480 images, featuring a hybrid VLM judger evaluation framework based on both the reference image and the combination of the original image with editing instructions that assesses models' abilities in multi-turn generation, visual memory, and world-knowledge reasoning across diverse domains. Experiments demonstrate that training on WEAVE-100k enables vision comprehension, image editing, and comprehension-generation collaboration capabilities. Furthermore, it facilitates UMMs to develop emergent visual-memory capabilities, while extensive evaluations on WEAVEBench expose the persistent limitations and challenges of current approaches in multi-turn, context-aware image generation and editing. We believe WEAVE provides a view and foundation for studying in-context interleaved comprehension and generation for multi-modal community.

*Maria-Teresa De Rosa Palmini,Eva Cetinic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估框架，用于区分文本到图像扩散模型中的文化参考识别与实现，揭示了模型在复制与转换文化知识方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像扩散模型中泛化与记忆之间的模糊性，特别关注多模态标志性现象，即图像和文本唤起文化共享关联的情况。

Method: 引入评估框架分离识别（模型是否识别参考）与实现（如何通过复制或重新诠释描绘参考），评估五个扩散模型在767个维基数据文化参考上的表现，并进行提示扰动实验。

Result: 框架比现有基于相似性的方法更有效地区分复制与转换；模型即使文本线索改变也经常复制标志性视觉结构；文化对齐与训练数据频率、文本独特性、参考流行度和创建日期相关。

Conclusion: 扩散模型的价值不仅在于复制内容，更在于如何转换和重新情境化文化知识，推动评估超越简单的文本-图像匹配，实现更丰富的语境理解。

Abstract: Our work addresses the ambiguity between generalization and memorization in text-to-image diffusion models, focusing on a specific case we term multimodal iconicity. This refers to instances where images and texts evoke culturally shared associations, such as when a title recalls a familiar artwork or film scene. While prior research on memorization and unlearning emphasizes forgetting, we examine what is remembered and how, focusing on the balance between recognizing cultural references and reproducing them. We introduce an evaluation framework that separates recognition, whether a model identifies a reference, from realization, how it depicts it through replication or reinterpretation, quantified through measures capturing both dimensions. By evaluating five diffusion models across 767 Wikidata-derived cultural references spanning static and dynamic imagery, we show that our framework distinguishes replication from transformation more effectively than existing similarity-based methods. To assess linguistic sensitivity, we conduct prompt perturbation experiments using synonym substitutions and literal image descriptions, finding that models often reproduce iconic visual structures even when textual cues are altered. Finally, our analysis shows that cultural alignment correlates not only with training data frequency, but also textual uniqueness, reference popularity, and creation date. Our work reveals that the value of diffusion models lies not only in what they reproduce but in how they transform and recontextualize cultural knowledge, advancing evaluation beyond simple text-image matching toward richer contextual understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hi-DREAM是一种基于大脑皮层层次结构的条件扩散框架，通过将fMRI信号按视觉皮层层次分组并注入到扩散模型的不同深度，实现了高效且可解释的脑活动到图像的解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散的脑活动解码器大多直接使用fMRI特征，忽略了大脑视觉皮层的层次处理结构，无法区分早期、中期和晚期视觉区域的不同功能角色。

Method: 提出Hi-DREAM框架：1）ROI适配器将fMRI信号分为早期/中期/晚期视觉流；2）构建与U-Net深度对齐的多尺度皮层金字塔；3）使用轻量级ControlNet在去噪过程中注入尺度特定提示。

Result: 在Natural Scenes Dataset上的实验表明，Hi-DREAM在高层次语义指标上达到最先进性能，同时保持竞争力的低层次保真度。

Conclusion: 基于皮层层次结构的条件化方法比纯数据驱动的嵌入更有效，为研究视觉皮层功能提供了有用的视角。

Abstract: Mapping human brain activity to natural images offers a new window into vision and cognition, yet current diffusion-based decoders face a core difficulty: most condition directly on fMRI features without analyzing how visual information is organized across the cortex. This overlooks the brain's hierarchical processing and blurs the roles of early, middle, and late visual areas. We propose Hi-DREAM, a brain-inspired conditional diffusion framework that makes the cortical organization explicit. A region-of-interest (ROI) adapter groups fMRI into early/mid/late streams and converts them into a multi-scale cortical pyramid aligned with the U-Net depth (shallow scales preserve layout and edges; deeper scales emphasize objects and semantics). A lightweight, depth-matched ControlNet injects these scale-specific hints during denoising. The result is an efficient and interpretable decoder in which each signal plays a brain-like role, allowing the model not only to reconstruct images but also to illuminate functional contributions of different visual areas. Experiments on the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) show that Hi-DREAM attains state-of-the-art performance on high-level semantic metrics while maintaining competitive low-level fidelity. These findings suggest that structuring conditioning by cortical hierarchy is a powerful alternative to purely data-driven embeddings and provides a useful lens for studying the visual cortex.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准缺乏对MLLMs理解视觉提示能力的系统评估，无法确定模型是否能有效识别和使用这种直观的人类提示方法。

Method: 采用两阶段评估框架：第一阶段评估模型在自然场景中感知视觉提示的能力，使用30k可视化提示；第二阶段研究视觉提示对下游任务的影响。

Result: 评估了28个MLLMs，包括专有系统和开源模型，提供了影响视觉提示理解因素的全面分析。

Conclusion: VP-Bench为研究MLLMs如何理解和解决基于视觉提示的问题建立了新的参考框架。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled a wide range of advanced vision-language applications, including fine-grained object recognition and contextual understanding. When querying specific regions or objects in an image, human users naturally use "visual prompts" (VPs), such as bounding boxes, to provide reference. However, no existing benchmark systematically evaluates the ability of MLLMs to interpret such VPs. This gap leaves it unclear whether current MLLMs can effectively recognize VPs, an intuitive prompting method for humans, and use them to solve problems. To address this limitation, we introduce VP-Bench, a benchmark for assessing MLLMs' capability in VP perception and utilization. VP-Bench employs a two-stage evaluation framework: Stage 1 examines models' ability to perceive VPs in natural scenes, using 30k visualized prompts spanning eight shapes and 355 attribute combinations. Stage 2 investigates the impact of VPs on downstream tasks, measuring their effectiveness in real-world problem-solving scenarios. Using VP-Bench, we evaluate 28 MLLMs, including proprietary systems (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-source models (e.g., InternVL3 and Qwen2.5-VL), and provide a comprehensive analysis of factors that affect VP understanding, such as variations in VP attributes, question arrangement, and model scale. VP-Bench establishes a new reference framework for studying how MLLMs comprehend and resolve grounded referring questions.

Abstract: Chess has experienced a large increase in viewership since the pandemic, driven largely by the accessibility of online learning platforms. However, no equivalent assistance exists for physical chess games, creating a divide between analog and digital chess experiences. This paper presents CVChess, a deep learning framework for converting chessboard images to Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN), which is later input into online chess engines to provide you with the best next move. Our approach employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) with residual layers to perform piece recognition from smartphone camera images. The system processes RGB images of a physical chess board through a multistep process: image preprocessing using the Hough Line Transform for edge detection, projective transform to achieve a top-down board alignment, segmentation into 64 individual squares, and piece classification into 13 classes (6 unique white pieces, 6 unique black pieces and an empty square) using the residual CNN. Residual connections help retain low-level visual features while enabling deeper feature extraction, improving accuracy and stability during training. We train and evaluate our model using the Chess Recognition Dataset (ChessReD), containing 10,800 annotated smartphone images captured under diverse lighting conditions and angles. The resulting classifications are encoded as an FEN string, which can be fed into a chess engine to generate the most optimal move

Motivation: 解决遥感多模态分类中因环境干扰、传感器故障或大气效应导致的模态缺失问题，现有两阶段适应方法计算成本高且假设训练时数据完整，限制了在真实世界不完整情况下的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MaMOL是一个通用且高效的解决方案，适用于不完整多模态学习，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Multimodal classification in remote sensing often suffers from missing modalities caused by environmental interference, sensor failures, or atmospheric effects, which severely degrade classification performance. Existing two-stage adaptation methods are computationally expensive and assume complete multimodal data during training, limiting their generalization to real-world incompleteness. To overcome these issues, we propose a Missing-aware Mixture-of-Loras (MaMOL) framework that reformulates modality missing as a multi-task learning problem. MaMOL introduces a dual-routing mechanism: a task-oriented dynamic router that adaptively activates experts for different missing patterns, and a modality-specific-shared static router that maintains stable cross-modal knowledge sharing. Unlike prior methods that train separate networks for each missing configuration, MaMOL achieves parameter-efficient adaptation via lightweight expert updates and shared expert reuse. Experiments on multiple remote sensing benchmarks demonstrate superior robustness and generalization under varying missing rates, with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, transfer experiments on natural image datasets validate its scalability and cross-domain applicability, highlighting MaMOL as a general and efficient solution for incomplete multimodal learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然VLLMs在多页视觉丰富文档的视觉问答方面表现出色，但它们在检测不可回答问题方面的能力仍然是一个开放的研究问题，需要评估其对看似合理但无法回答问题的鲁棒性。

Method: 通过替换原始自然语言实体为相同类型但属于不同文档元素、不同布局位置或不同页面的实体，生成看似合理但无法回答的问题，并使用VLLM作为评判者验证其不可回答性。

Result: 在12个模型上的实验揭示了VLLMs在检测不可回答问题方面的局限性，特别是在页面和文档级别的准确性上存在不足，不同腐败类型对模型性能有不同影响。

Conclusion: VRD-UQA可以作为开发弹性文档VQA系统的评估框架，揭示了VLLMs的局限性，并为提高模型对不可回答问题的检测能力提供了方向。

Abstract: The evolution of Visual Large Language Models (VLLMs) has revolutionized the automatic understanding of Visually Rich Documents (VRDs), which contain both textual and visual elements. Although VLLMs excel in Visual Question Answering (VQA) on multi-page VRDs, their ability to detect unanswerable questions is still an open research question. Our research delves into the robustness of the VLLMs to plausible yet unanswerable questions, i.e., questions that appear valid but cannot be answered due to subtle corruptions caused by swaps between related concepts or plausible question formulations. Corruptions are generated by replacing the original natural language entities with other ones of the same type, belonging to different document elements, and in different layout positions or pages of the related document. To this end, we present VRD-UQA (VISUALLY RICH DOCUMENT UNANSWERABLE QUESTION ANSWERING), a benchmark for evaluating VLLMs' resilience to plausible yet unanswerable questions across multiple dimensions. It automatically alters the questions of existing VQA datasets consisting of multi-page VRDs, verifies their unanswerability using a VLLM-as-a-judge approach, and then thoroughly evaluates VLLMs' performance. Experiments, run on 12 models, analyze: (1) The VLLMs' accuracy in detecting unanswerable questions at both page and document levels; (2) The effect of different types of corruption (NLP entity, document element, layout); (3) The effectiveness of different knowledge injection strategies based on in-context learning (OCR, multi-page selection, or the possibility of unanswerability). Our findings reveal VLLMs' limitations and demonstrate that VRD-UQA can serve as an evaluation framework for developing resilient document VQA systems.

*Yijie Kang,Xinliang Wang,Zhenyu Wu,Yifeng Shi,Hailong Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sat2RealCity是一个从真实世界卫星图像生成3D城市的新框架，通过基于建筑实体的生成方法，解决了现有方法对大规模3D城市资产和语义/高度图的依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D城市生成方法面临两个关键挑战：需要难以获取的大规模3D城市资产进行监督训练，以及依赖语义或高度图导致生成的城市缺乏真实世界外观连接，限制了真实性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出了三个核心技术：(1)基于OSM的空间先验策略，实现从空间拓扑到建筑实例的可解释几何生成；(2)外观引导的可控建模机制，实现细粒度外观真实性和风格控制；(3)MLLM驱动的语义引导生成管道，桥接语义解释和几何重建。

Result: 广泛的定量和定性实验表明，Sat2RealCity在结构一致性和外观真实性方面显著超越现有基线方法。

Conclusion: Sat2RealCity为真实世界对齐的3D城市内容创建奠定了坚实基础，代码即将发布。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have substantially enhanced 3D urban generation, enabling applications in digital twins, virtual cities, and large-scale simulations. However, existing methods face two key challenges: (1) the need for large-scale 3D city assets for supervised training, which are difficult and costly to obtain, and (2) reliance on semantic or height maps, which are used exclusively for generating buildings in virtual worlds and lack connection to real-world appearance, limiting the realism and generalizability of generated cities. To address these limitations, we propose Sat2RealCity, a geometry-aware and appearance-controllable framework for 3D urban generation from real-world satellite imagery. Unlike previous city-level generation methods, Sat2RealCity builds generation upon individual building entities, enabling the use of rich priors and pretrained knowledge from 3D object generation while substantially reducing dependence on large-scale 3D city assets. Specifically, (1) we introduce the OSM-based spatial priors strategy to achieve interpretable geometric generation from spatial topology to building instances; (2) we design an appearance-guided controllable modeling mechanism for fine-grained appearance realism and style control; and (3) we construct an MLLM-powered semantic-guided generation pipeline, bridging semantic interpretation and geometric reconstruction. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that Sat2RealCity significantly surpasses existing baselines in structural consistency and appearance realism, establishing a strong foundation for real-world aligned 3D urban content creation. The code will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ImAgent是一个无需训练的统一多模态代理，在单个框架内集成推理、生成和自评估，通过动态交互的生成动作提升图像生成质量，实现高效的测试时扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在文本描述模糊时存在随机性和不一致性问题，现有方法需要额外模块且独立运行，影响测试时扩展效率和增加计算开销。

Method: 引入ImAgent，通过策略控制器引导多个生成动作动态交互和自组织，在单个框架内实现推理、生成和自评估，无需外部模型。

Result: 在图像生成和编辑任务上的广泛实验表明，ImAgent持续改进基础模型性能，甚至在基础模型失败的情况下超越其他强基线。

Conclusion: 统一多模态代理在测试时扩展下具有实现自适应和高效图像生成的潜力。

Abstract: Recent text-to-image (T2I) models have made remarkable progress in generating visually realistic and semantically coherent images. However, they still suffer from randomness and inconsistency with the given prompts, particularly when textual descriptions are vague or underspecified. Existing approaches, such as prompt rewriting, best-of-N sampling, and self-refinement, can mitigate these issues but usually require additional modules and operate independently, hindering test-time scaling efficiency and increasing computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce ImAgent, a training-free unified multimodal agent that integrates reasoning, generation, and self-evaluation within a single framework for efficient test-time scaling. Guided by a policy controller, multiple generation actions dynamically interact and self-organize to enhance image fidelity and semantic alignment without relying on external models. Extensive experiments on image generation and editing tasks demonstrate that ImAgent consistently improves over the backbone and even surpasses other strong baselines where the backbone model fails, highlighting the potential of unified multimodal agents for adaptive and efficient image generation under test-time scaling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: nnUNet-B：基于贝叶斯分割框架，通过多模态后验采样从H&E染色组织学图像直接推断PD-L1表达，提供准确分割和认知不确定性估计


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于免疫组织化学的PD-L1表达评估方法资源密集，需要更高效、可扩展的替代方案

Method: 基于nnUNet-v2构建的贝叶斯分割框架，使用多模态后验采样在循环训练中采样多样化模型检查点，通过熵和标准差估计认知不确定性

Result: 在肺鳞状细胞癌数据集上，平均Dice分数0.805，平均IoU 0.709，性能与现有基线方法相当，同时提供像素级不确定性图

Conclusion: 基于H&E的不确定性感知PD-L1预测是迈向临床工作流程中可扩展、可解释生物标志物评估的有前景的一步

Abstract: Accurate assessment of PD-L1 expression is critical for guiding immunotherapy, yet current immunohistochemistry (IHC) based methods are resource-intensive. We present nnUNet-B: a Bayesian segmentation framework that infers PD-L1 expression directly from H&E-stained histology images using Multimodal Posterior Sampling (MPS). Built upon nnUNet-v2, our method samples diverse model checkpoints during cyclic training to approximate the posterior, enabling both accurate segmentation and epistemic uncertainty estimation via entropy and standard deviation. Evaluated on a dataset of lung squamous cell carcinoma, our approach achieves competitive performance against established baselines with mean Dice Score and mean IoU of 0.805 and 0.709, respectively, while providing pixel-wise uncertainty maps. Uncertainty estimates show strong correlation with segmentation error, though calibration remains imperfect. These results suggest that uncertainty-aware H&E-based PD-L1 prediction is a promising step toward scalable, interpretable biomarker assessment in clinical workflows.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Prelim Attention Score (PAS)方法，利用注意力权重检测大型视觉语言模型中的物体幻觉问题，无需额外训练即可实时检测和干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型存在物体幻觉问题，研究发现模型在产生幻觉预测时会忽略图像而依赖先前生成的token来推断新物体。

Method: 通过条件互信息量化图像依赖度，提出基于注意力权重的PAS评分，无需额外前向传播即可实时计算。

Result: PAS在多个模型和数据集上实现了最先进的物体幻觉检测性能，支持实时过滤和干预。

Conclusion: PAS是一种轻量级、无需训练的信号，能有效检测物体幻觉，为模型可靠性提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are powerful, yet they remain unreliable due to object hallucinations. In this work, we show that in many hallucinatory predictions the LVLM effectively ignores the image and instead relies on previously generated output (prelim) tokens to infer new objects. We quantify this behavior via the mutual information between the image and the predicted object conditioned on the prelim, demonstrating that weak image dependence strongly correlates with hallucination. Building on this finding, we introduce the Prelim Attention Score (PAS), a lightweight, training-free signal computed from attention weights over prelim tokens. PAS requires no additional forward passes and can be computed on the fly during inference. Exploiting this previously overlooked signal, PAS achieves state-of-the-art object-hallucination detection across multiple models and datasets, enabling real-time filtering and intervention.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声图像解释高度依赖操作者，且在不同解剖区域、采集协议和设备类型间差异显著，加上斑点噪声、低对比度和标准化标注有限等挑战，阻碍了通用化、标签高效的超声AI模型发展。

Method: 使用视觉Mamba骨干网络捕获局部和全局长程依赖；提出结合对比学习和掩码图像建模的自适应掩码框架，集成教师注意力图和学生重建损失；采用动态学习进度表调整预训练难度；在42个公共数据集、30.8万张图像上预训练。

Result: 开发了首个开源超声基础模型OpenUS，构建了迄今为止最大的公共超声数据集，模型可作为骨干网络支持标签高效的下游任务微调。

Conclusion: OpenUS为超声AI提供了可复现的基础模型解决方案，通过大规模数据预训练和自适应学习策略，有望推动通用化超声AI模型的发展。

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) is one of the most widely used medical imaging modalities, thanks to its low cost, portability, real-time feedback, and absence of ionizing radiation. However, US image interpretation remains highly operator-dependent and varies significantly across anatomical regions, acquisition protocols, and device types. These variations, along with unique challenges such as speckle, low contrast, and limited standardized annotations, hinder the development of generalizable, label-efficient ultrasound AI models. In this paper, we propose OpenUS, the first reproducible, open-source ultrasound foundation model built on a large collection of public data. OpenUS employs a vision Mamba backbone, capturing both local and global long-range dependencies across the image. To extract rich features during pre-training, we introduce a novel self-adaptive masking framework that combines contrastive learning with masked image modeling. This strategy integrates the teacher's attention map with student reconstruction loss, adaptively refining clinically-relevant masking to enhance pre-training effectiveness. OpenUS also applies a dynamic learning schedule to progressively adjust the difficulty of the pre-training process. To develop the foundation model, we compile the largest to-date public ultrasound dataset comprising over 308K images from 42 publicly available datasets, covering diverse anatomical regions, institutions, imaging devices, and disease types. Our pre-trained OpenUS model can be easily adapted to specific downstream tasks by serving as a backbone for label-efficient fine-tuning. Code is available at https://github.com/XZheng0427/OpenUS.

### [114] [Bridging Hidden States in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11526)
*Benjamin Fein-Ashley,Jacob Fein-Ashley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BRIDGE提出了一种轻量级的跨模态融合模块，通过在编码器顶部添加少量双向注意力层来对齐视觉和文本的隐藏状态，实现了高效的视觉语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型融合方法要么在编码器早期融合（混合token/特征），要么在后期比较池化嵌入，且通常与自回归解码器绑定。但两种模态的隐藏状态已经包含丰富的模态特定结构，直接对齐这些状态是更自然的匹配方式。

Method: 在视觉和文本编码器顶部附近放置少量仅跨模态、双向的注意力层。每个层将隐藏状态序列投影到共享空间，进行跨模态注意力计算，并通过门控残差更新返回，使用简单的稳定器来改善对齐效果。

Result: 在标准检索、VQA和视觉推理基准测试中，BRIDGE优于可比较的视觉语言模型，同时保持了对比模型的双编码器效率。

Conclusion: BRIDGE提供了一种有效的跨模态对齐方法，编码器保持非因果性和强大的理解能力，而生成通过可选解码器保持解耦，实现了高效且性能优越的视觉语言建模。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are a new family of models that align image content with natural language. Existing approaches typically fuse either (a) early: by mixing tokens/features inside the encoders, or (b) late: by comparing pooled embeddings. Many methods also tie fusion to an autoregressive decoder. However, the hidden states of both modalities already carry rich, modality-specific structure (spatial layout in vision; syntax and semantics in text), so directly aligning these states is a natural way to match what the two modalities "think". We propose a lightweight fusion module: a few cross-only, bidirectional attention layers placed near the top of both encoders. Each layer projects the vision and text encoder hidden-state sequences into a shared space, attends across modalities, and sends gated residual updates back, with simple stabilizers to improve alignment. The encoders remain non-causal and strong for understanding, while generation stays cleanly decoupled via an optional decoder. Across standard retrieval, VQA, and visual reasoning benchmarks, BRIDGE outperforms comparable VLMs while preserving the bi-encoder efficiency of contrastive models. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/jfeinashley/BRIDGE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化方法需要密集多视角输入和昂贵的逐实例优化，可扩展性有限；现有feedforward方法产生粗糙几何、缺乏纹理重建且依赖复杂多阶段流程。

Method: 将LVSM扩展到关节设置，使用基于transformer的架构联合推理相机姿态和关节变化，生成深度图和部件掩码以促进显式3D网格提取和关节估计。

Result: 在多个任务上优于最先进方法，生成高质量网格，紧密贴合输入图像，支持高保真重建。

Conclusion: LARM提供了一种可扩展且准确的3D关节物体重建方法，无需密集监督，在多个应用场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Modeling 3D articulated objects with realistic geometry, textures, and kinematics is essential for a wide range of applications. However, existing optimization-based reconstruction methods often require dense multi-view inputs and expensive per-instance optimization, limiting their scalability. Recent feedforward approaches offer faster alternatives but frequently produce coarse geometry, lack texture reconstruction, and rely on brittle, complex multi-stage pipelines. We introduce LARM, a unified feedforward framework that reconstructs 3D articulated objects from sparse-view images by jointly recovering detailed geometry, realistic textures, and accurate joint structures. LARM extends LVSM a recent novel view synthesis (NVS) approach for static 3D objects into the articulated setting by jointly reasoning over camera pose and articulation variation using a transformer-based architecture, enabling scalable and accurate novel view synthesis. In addition, LARM generates auxiliary outputs such as depth maps and part masks to facilitate explicit 3D mesh extraction and joint estimation. Our pipeline eliminates the need for dense supervision and supports high-fidelity reconstruction across diverse object categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LARM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both novel view and state synthesis as well as 3D articulated object reconstruction, generating high-quality meshes that closely adhere to the input images. project page: https://sylviayuan-sy.github.io/larm-site/

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合结构和语义分析的无监督循环检测框架，用于检测LLM驱动的智能应用中隐藏的执行循环，这些循环会消耗资源但不触发显式错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统可观测性平台无法检测LLM智能应用中非确定性行为形成的隐藏执行循环，这些循环会默默消耗资源而不触发显式错误。

Method: 采用混合方法：首先进行高效的时间调用栈分析识别显式循环，然后利用语义相似性分析发现由冗余内容生成形成的微妙循环。

Result: 在基于LangGraph的股票市场应用的1575条轨迹上评估，混合方法F1得分为0.72（精确率0.62，召回率0.86），显著优于单独的结构方法（F1: 0.08）和语义方法（F1: 0.28）。

Conclusion: 虽然结果令人鼓舞，但仍有很大改进空间，未来工作需要完善方法并解决当前局限性。

Abstract: Agentic applications powered by Large Language Models exhibit non-deterministic behaviors that can form hidden execution cycles, silently consuming resources without triggering explicit errors. Traditional observability platforms fail to detect these costly inefficiencies. We present an unsupervised cycle detection framework that combines structural and semantic analysis. Our approach first applies computationally efficient temporal call stack analysis to identify explicit loops and then leverages semantic similarity analysis to uncover subtle cycles characterized by redundant content generation. Evaluated on 1575 trajectories from a LangGraph-based stock market application, our hybrid approach achieves an F1 score of 0.72 (precision: 0.62, recall: 0.86), significantly outperforming individual structural (F1: 0.08) and semantic methods (F1: 0.28). While these results are encouraging, there remains substantial scope for improvement, and future work is needed to refine the approach and address its current limitations.

Motivation: 传统手动分析方法耗时且易出错，需要利用大语言模型的强大分析推理能力来提高军事仿真推演数据分析的效率和准确性。

Result: 评估结果表明，该方法生成的报告质量更高，得分优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效提升仿真推演数据分析的效率和报告质量，具有广泛的应用适应性。

Abstract: Data analysis and performance evaluation of simulation deduction plays a pivotal role in modern warfare, which enables military personnel to gain invaluable insights into the potential effectiveness of different strategies, tactics, and operational plans. Traditional manual analysis approach is time-consuming and limited by human errors. To enhance efficiency and accuracy, large language models (LLMs) with strong analytical and inferencing capabilities can be employed. However, high-quality analysis reports with well-structured formatting cannot be obtained through a single instruction input to the LLM. To tackle this issue, we propose a method that first decomposes the complex task into several sub-tasks and designs effective system prompts and user prompts for each sub-task. Multi-round interactions with the LLM incorporating self-check and reflection are then conducted to enable structured data extraction as well as multi-step analysis and evaluation. Furthermore, custom tools are defined and invoked to generate figures and compute metrics. We also design multiple report templates, each tailored to a specific application and input data type, ensuring their adaptability across a variety of scenarios. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that the reports generated by our method exhibit higher quality, therefore obtaining higher scores than the baseline method.

Motivation: 现有方法在历史人物对话系统中面临关键权衡：简单检索增强生成产生浅层响应，而多阶段反思虽然能达到深度但延迟过高。

Method: 将传记数据转化为1774个丰富的第一人称记忆，带有情感语义元数据，采用两阶段检索实现0.52秒的提示生成，结合离线数据增强和高效并行检索。

Conclusion: 该架构可推广到任何有大量文本记录的历史人物，为教育、博物馆和研究应用提供了既准确又高效的实用框架。

Abstract: Large language models show promise for embodying historical characters in dialogue systems, but existing approaches face a critical trade-off: simple retrieval-augmented generation produces shallow responses, while multi-stage reflection achieves depth at prohibitive latency. We present an architecture that resolves this tension through offline data augmentation and efficient parallel retrieval from structured episodic memory. Our system transforms biographical data into 1,774 enriched first-person memories with affective-semantic metadata, then employs two-stage retrieval achieving 0.52s prompt generation. Evaluation using LLM-as-judge and RAGAs metrics shows our approach achieves parity with traditional RAG on GPT-4 while significantly outperforming it on smaller models (GPT-3.5, GPT-3), suggesting particular value for resource-constrained deployments. Beyond dialogue, the structured memory enables novel visualization tools: spatiotemporal heatmaps, emotional trajectory analysis, and interactive path tracking, positioning the system as both a dialogue interface and research tool for biographical analysis. We use Van Gogh as a test case, but the architecture is generalizable to any historical figure with substantial textual records, offering a practical framework for educational, museum, and research applications requiring both accuracy and efficiency

TL;DR: 提出了首个用于自然语言生成的混合量子-经典大语言模型HyQuT，在Transformer框架中集成变分量子电路，在1.5亿参数规模下用10个量子比特和80个量子门替换约10%的经典参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然量子计算逐渐应用于替代经典计算，但现有量子或混合模型仍局限于简单任务，尚未成功应用于大规模自然语言生成。

Method: 在Transformer框架中集成变分量子电路（VQCs），构建了8M和150M参数规模的混合量子-经典大语言模型。

Result: 实验结果显示，仅需10个量子比特和80个量子门就能替换150M参数模型中约10%的经典参数，同时保持相当的收敛稳定性和生成质量。

Conclusion: 这项研究为将量子计算集成到大规模生成语言模型提供了早期可行性证明。

Abstract: Although quantum computing has been increasingly applied to replace classical computation, most existing quantum or hybrid models remain confined to simple tasks, with no successful application to large-scale natural language generation to date. In this work, we present the first hybrid quantum-classical large language model (LLM) for natural language generation, HyQuT, capable of performing coherent and context-aware dialogue. The proposed architecture integrates variational quantum circuits (VQCs) into the Transformer framework at both 8M and 150M parameter scales. Experimental results show that a minimal number of qubits (10 qubits with 80 quantum gates) can replace about 10% of the classical parameters in the 150M-parameter model, while achieving comparable convergence stability and generation quality. This study provides an early demonstration of the feasibility of integrating quantum computing to large-scale generative language models.

*Javier Marín*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在时间约束处理方面存在系统性风险：双峰性能分布、极端提示脆弱性和系统性行动偏见，无法通过自然语言的下一个词预测可靠学习时间约束满足能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试LLMs在需要实时决策的智能体架构中是否能够可靠判断行动窗口是否仍然开放或已关闭，这一假设尚未经过验证。

Method: 使用截止时间检测任务对8个生产级模型（2.8-8B参数）进行时间约束处理特性分析，包括性能分布、提示敏感性和行动偏见评估。

Result: 发现系统性部署风险：双峰性能分布（模型准确率要么95%要么50%）、极端提示脆弱性（仅格式变化就导致30-60个百分点波动）和系统性行动偏见（失败模型100%假阳性率）。参数数量在此范围内与能力无相关性。

Conclusion: 当前自回归架构缺乏连续时间状态表示、显式约束检查和系统性组合推理机制，在时间关键应用中部署此类系统而不采用包含符号推理模块的混合架构存在不可接受风险。

Abstract: When deploying LLMs in agentic architectures requiring real-time decisions under temporal constraints, we assume they reliably determine whether action windows remain open or have closed. This assumption is untested. We characterize temporal constraint processing across eight production-scale models (2.8-8B parameters) using deadline detection tasks, revealing systematic deployment risks: bimodal performance distribution (models achieve either 95% or 50% accuracy), extreme prompt brittleness (30-60 percentage point swings from formatting changes alone), and systematic action bias (100% false positive rates in failing models). Parameter count shows no correlation with capability in this range-a 3.8B model matches 7B models while other 7B models fail completely. Fine-tuning on 200 synthetic examples improves models with partial capability by 12-37 percentage points. We demonstrate that temporal constraint satisfaction cannot be reliably learned through next-token prediction on natural language, even with targeted fine-tuning. This capability requires architectural mechanisms for: (1) continuous temporal state representation, (2) explicit constraint checking separate from linguistic pattern matching, (3) systematic compositional reasoning over temporal relations. Current autoregressive architectures lack these mechanisms. Deploying such systems in time-critical applications without hybrid architectures incorporating symbolic reasoning modules represents unacceptable risk.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 扩展Spectral NSR框架，通过三个语义增强模块：基于transformer的节点合并、句子级蕴含验证和外部知识图谱对齐，在不改变核心谱推理引擎的情况下提升图质量和推理准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Spectral NSR框架在图构建阶段存在冗余节点、低质量边和上下文缺失的问题，需要在不依赖二次注意力机制的情况下提升推理系统的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Method: 1) 使用Sentence-BERT、SimCSE等上下文嵌入进行transformer节点合并；2) 使用RoBERTa、DeBERTa等预训练NLI分类器进行句子级蕴含验证；3) 与ConceptNet、Wikidata等外部知识图谱对齐补充缺失上下文。

Result: 在ProofWriter、EntailmentBank和CLUTRR基准测试中，准确率提升最高达3.8%，对对抗性案例的泛化能力增强，推理噪声减少。

Conclusion: 通过在谱推理阶段之前进行语义和符号精炼，实现了高效、可解释且可扩展的推理系统，适用于开放域和真实世界场景。

Abstract: This report extends the Spectral Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning (Spectral NSR) framework by introducing three semantically grounded enhancements: (1) transformer-based node merging using contextual embeddings (e.g., Sentence-BERT, SimCSE) to reduce redundancy, (2) sentence-level entailment validation with pretrained NLI classifiers (e.g., RoBERTa, DeBERTa) to improve edge quality, and (3) alignment with external knowledge graphs (e.g., ConceptNet, Wikidata) to augment missing context. These modifications enhance graph fidelity while preserving the core spectral reasoning pipeline. Experimental results on ProofWriter, EntailmentBank, and CLUTRR benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains (up to +3.8\%), improved generalization to adversarial cases, and reduced inference noise. The novelty lies in performing semantic and symbolic refinement entirely upstream of the spectral inference stage, enabling efficient, interpretable, and scalable reasoning without relying on quadratic attention mechanisms. In summary, this work extends the Spectral NSR framework with modular, semantically grounded preprocessing steps that improve graph quality without altering the core spectral reasoning engine. The result is a more robust, interpretable, and scalable reasoning system suitable for deployment in open-domain and real-world settings.

Motivation: 传统对话模型在嘈杂多说话者环境中表现不佳，常产生不相关响应和尴尬的话轮转换。需要结合视听信息来提升真实环境下的对话质量。

Conclusion: 视听结合的方法为说话者感知交互提供了强大能力，为在真实嘈杂环境中稳健运行的语音对话代理铺平了道路。

Abstract: Dialogue models falter in noisy, multi-speaker environments, often producing irrelevant responses and awkward turn-taking. We present AV-Dialog, the first multimodal dialog framework that uses both audio and visual cues to track the target speaker, predict turn-taking, and generate coherent responses. By combining acoustic tokenization with multi-task, multi-stage training on monadic, synthetic, and real audio-visual dialogue datasets, AV-Dialog achieves robust streaming transcription, semantically grounded turn-boundary detection and accurate responses, resulting in a natural conversational flow. Experiments show that AV-Dialog outperforms audio-only models under interference, reducing transcription errors, improving turn-taking prediction, and enhancing human-rated dialogue quality. These results highlight the power of seeing as well as hearing for speaker-aware interaction, paving the way for {spoken} dialogue agents that perform {robustly} in real-world, noisy environments.

TL;DR: PRO框架通过轻量级偏好适配器自动推断特定提示的偏好权重，解决了多目标对齐中手动指定权重的问题，提升了训练效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要手动指定偏好权重，这给用户带来负担且导致训练效率低下，因为会探索不相关的偏好组合。

Method: 提出PRO框架，使用轻量级偏好适配器自动学习每个提示的适当偏好权重，基于多个奖励模型对偏好响应的归一化奖励分数进行训练。

Result: 理论分析证明该方法在多目标对齐场景中优于固定偏好权重，多个任务的广泛实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: PRO框架能够自动推断提示特定的偏好权重，在多目标对齐中实现了更好的性能和训练效率。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse natural language processing tasks, aligning these models with varying human preferences across multiple objectives remains a significant challenge in practical deployments. Existing multi-objective alignment methods rely on manually specified preference weights, which not only burden users with difficult preference specification tasks but also lead to suboptimal training efficiency due to exploration of irrelevant preference combinations. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel framework named PRO, i.e., PReference Orchestrator, which features a lightweight preference adapter that automatically infers prompt-specific preference weights during both training and deployment phases. Specifically, the adapter automatically learns appropriate preference weights for each prompt by training on normalized reward scores from multiple reward models for preferred responses, which inherently reflect effective preference balances across objectives. Additionally, We provide theoretical analysis proving that our prompt-aware preference mechanism achieves superior performance compared to fixed preference weights in multi-objective alignment scenarios. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over existing multi-objective alignment approaches.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于多视图对比学习的专利嵌入框架，通过利用专利文档内部的不同章节（如摘要、权利要求、背景技术）作为互补视图，解决了SimCSE风格dropout增强在专利数据上导致嵌入过度均匀化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SimCSE风格dropout增强在专利数据上产生的特定失败模式——产生过度均匀的嵌入，失去语义内聚性。专利文档固有的章节结构提供了自然的语义和结构多样性。

Method: 使用基于章节的增强策略，将专利文档的不同部分（摘要、权利要求、背景技术等）作为对比学习的互补视图，引入自然的语义和结构多样性。

Result: 在大规模基准测试中，这种完全自监督的方法在现有技术检索和分类任务上匹配或超越了基于引用和IPC监督的基线方法，同时避免了依赖脆弱或不完整的标注。

Conclusion: 不同专利章节专门用于不同任务——权利要求和摘要有利于检索，背景技术部分有助于分类，这凸显了利用专利固有语篇结构进行表示学习的价值。

Abstract: This paper presents a simple yet effective contrastive learning framework for learning patent embeddings by leveraging multiple views from within the same document. We first identify a patent-specific failure mode of SimCSE style dropout augmentation: it produces overly uniform embeddings that lose semantic cohesion. To remedy this, we propose section-based augmentation, where different sections of a patent (e.g., abstract, claims, background) serve as complementary views. This design introduces natural semantic and structural diversity, mitigating over-dispersion and yielding embeddings that better preserve both global structure and local continuity. On large-scale benchmarks, our fully self-supervised method matches or surpasses citation-and IPC-supervised baselines in prior-art retrieval and classification, while avoiding reliance on brittle or incomplete annotations. Our analysis further shows that different sections specialize for different tasks-claims and summaries benefit retrieval, while background sections aid classification-highlighting the value of patents' inherent discourse structure for representation learning. These results highlight the value of exploiting intra-document views for scalable and generalizable patent understanding.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注单一任务、有限模型和英文报告，需要评估LLM在多疾病、多语言、多机构临床记录中的结构化信息提取能力。

Method: 使用15个开源LLM（包括通用和医学专用模型），在6个医学用例中比较6种提示策略，采用任务特定指标评估性能，使用共识排名聚合和线性混合效应模型分析方差。

Result: 顶级模型性能接近人工标注者间一致性；中小型通用模型表现与大型模型相当；提示图和少样本提示可提升约13%性能；任务特定因素比模型大小或提示策略影响更大。

Conclusion: 开源LLM能够跨疾病、语言和机构从临床报告中提取结构化数据，为临床数据管理提供了可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to extract structured information from free-text clinical records, but prior work often focuses on single tasks, limited models, and English-language reports. We evaluated 15 open-weight LLMs on pathology and radiology reports across six use cases, colorectal liver metastases, liver tumours, neurodegenerative diseases, soft-tissue tumours, melanomas, and sarcomas, at three institutes in the Netherlands, UK, and Czech Republic. Models included general-purpose and medical-specialised LLMs of various sizes, and six prompting strategies were compared: zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, self-consistency, and prompt graph. Performance was assessed using task-appropriate metrics, with consensus rank aggregation and linear mixed-effects models quantifying variance. Top-ranked models achieved macro-average scores close to inter-rater agreement across tasks. Small-to-medium general-purpose models performed comparably to large models, while tiny and specialised models performed worse. Prompt graph and few-shot prompting improved performance by ~13%. Task-specific factors, including variable complexity and annotation variability, influenced results more than model size or prompting strategy. These findings show that open-weight LLMs can extract structured data from clinical reports across diseases, languages, and institutions, offering a scalable approach for clinical data curation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在文本理解方面表现出色，但在处理复杂的层次化表格数据方面仍有待探索。传统OCR方法难以验证数字提取的准确性，而财政表格的层次结构为数据验证提供了天然基础。

Method: 采用多阶段流水线方法，利用领域知识、顺序上下文和算法验证。通过财政表格固有的层次关系（每级都有总计）创建多级验证检查，确保数据提取的准确性。

Result: 在卡纳塔克邦200多页的年度财政文件上实现了高精度数据提取，验证了LLMs不仅能读取表格，还能处理文档特定的结构层次。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了将基于PDF的财政披露转换为研究就绪数据库的可扩展流程，在发展中国家背景下具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in text comprehension, but their ability to process complex, hierarchical tabular data remains underexplored. We present a novel approach to extracting structured data from multi-page government fiscal documents using LLM-based techniques. Applied to annual fiscal documents from the State of Karnataka in India (200+ pages), our method achieves high accuracy through a multi-stage pipeline that leverages domain knowledge, sequential context, and algorithmic validation. A large challenge with traditional OCR methods is the inability to verify the accurate extraction of numbers. When applied to fiscal data, the inherent structure of fiscal tables, with totals at each level of the hierarchy, allows for robust internal validation of the extracted data. We use these hierarchical relationships to create multi-level validation checks. We demonstrate that LLMs can read tables and also process document-specific structural hierarchies, offering a scalable process for converting PDF-based fiscal disclosures into research-ready databases. Our implementation shows promise for broader applications across developing country contexts.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过加权专家乘积（wPoE）进行测试时引导的新框架，将通用压缩模型与预训练神经语言模型自适应结合，确保压缩率至少与最佳单个模型相当，无需微调即可提升文本压缩性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统通用压缩器（如gzip）计算开销低、速度快、适用性广，但压缩率不如现代神经压缩器；而神经压缩器虽然能更有效建模数据分布，但在未见数据上泛化能力差。

Method: 使用加权专家乘积（wPoE）框架，在推理时自适应地结合通用压缩模型和预训练神经语言模型，确保压缩率不低于最佳单个模型。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法无需微调即可提升文本压缩性能，并能与任何自回归语言模型无缝集成。

Conclusion: 该框架为提升跨不同数据分布的文本压缩提供了实用解决方案，结合了通用压缩器和神经压缩器的优势。

Abstract: Lossless compression techniques are crucial in an era of rapidly growing data. Traditional universal compressors like gzip offer low computational overhead, high speed, and broad applicability across data distributions. However, they often lead to worse compression rates than modern neural compressors, which leverage large-scale training data to model data distributions more effectively. Despite their advantages, neural compressors struggle to generalize to unseen data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that performs Test-Time Steering via a Weighted Product of Experts (wPoE). At inference, our method adaptively combines a universal compression model with a pretrained neural language model, ensuring the compression rate is at least as good as that of the best individual model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of text compression without requiring fine-tuning. Furthermore, it seamlessly integrates with any autoregressive language model, providing a practical solution for enhancing text compression across diverse data distributions.

Conclusion: 提出的TopK + L2D方法通过同时考虑语义相似性和标签分布对齐，有效提升了上下文学习中演示选择的质量和LLM性能。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) for text classification, which uses a few input-label demonstrations to describe a task, has demonstrated impressive performance on large language models (LLMs). However, the selection of in-context demonstrations plays a crucial role and can significantly affect LLMs' performance. Most existing demonstration selection methods primarily focus on semantic similarity between test inputs and demonstrations, often overlooking the importance of label distribution alignment. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage demonstration selection method, TopK + Label Distribution Divergence (L2D), which leverages a fine-tuned BERT-like small language model (SLM) to generate label distributions and calculate their divergence for both test inputs and candidate demonstrations. This enables the selection of demonstrations that are not only semantically similar but also aligned in label distribution with the test input. Extensive experiments across seven text classification benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms previous demonstration selection strategies. Further analysis reveals a positive correlation between the performance of LLMs and the accuracy of the underlying SLMs used for label distribution estimation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种贝叶斯方法来量化大型语言模型（LLM）在二元评估指标中的统计不确定性，重点关注由概率文本生成策略引起的不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型文本生成系统评估方法往往忽视统计不确定性量化，而概率文本生成策略会引入显著的不确定性，需要更严谨的统计方法来评估模型行为。

Method: 采用贝叶斯方法来量化二元评估指标中的不确定性，通过两个案例研究：1）评估对抗性输入上的拒绝率；2）评估LLM在开放对话中的成对偏好。

Result: 贝叶斯方法能够为基于LLM的系统行为提供有用的不确定性量化，特别是在评估拒绝率和模型偏好等二元指标时。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯不确定性量化方法能够更全面地评估LLM文本生成系统的行为，为模型评估提供更可靠的统计基础。

Abstract: It is increasingly important to evaluate how text generation systems based on large language models (LLMs) behave, such as their tendency to produce harmful output or their sensitivity to adversarial inputs. Such evaluations often rely on a curated benchmark set of input prompts provided to the LLM, where the output for each prompt may be assessed in a binary fashion (e.g., harmful/non-harmful or does not leak/leaks sensitive information), and the aggregation of binary scores is used to evaluate the LLM. However, existing approaches to evaluation often neglect statistical uncertainty quantification. With an applied statistics audience in mind, we provide background on LLM text generation and evaluation, and then describe a Bayesian approach for quantifying uncertainty in binary evaluation metrics. We focus in particular on uncertainty that is induced by the probabilistic text generation strategies typically deployed in LLM-based systems. We present two case studies applying this approach: 1) evaluating refusal rates on a benchmark of adversarial inputs designed to elicit harmful responses, and 2) evaluating pairwise preferences of one LLM over another on a benchmark of open-ended interactive dialogue examples. We demonstrate how the Bayesian approach can provide useful uncertainty quantification about the behavior of LLM-based systems.

TL;DR: 工具增强语言模型在调用外部工具时会产生工具诱导近视(TIM)现象，即模型将工具输出作为推理的替代品，导致解决方案看似正确但缺乏连贯的推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究工具增强语言模型(TaLMs)在使用工具时的推理可信度问题，特别是当工具被正确选择和执行时，模型是否仍能保持连贯的推理过程。

Method: 使用PYMATH基准测试(1,679个竞赛级数学问题)，开发多维评估套件量化TaLMs相对于非工具模型的推理退化，并提出基于偏好优化的框架来重新调整TaLMs使用工具的方式。

Result: TaLMs在最终答案准确率上获得高达19.3个百分点的提升，但推理行为一致恶化(非工具LLMs在推理过程对比中胜出率高达41.5%)。工具使用越频繁，推理连贯性越差，且错误从算术错误转向全局推理失败。

Conclusion: 工具增强语言模型存在工具诱导近视问题，需要通过偏好优化等方法重新调整模型将工具作为辅助证据而非推理替代品，以同时提升答案准确率和推理深度。

Abstract: Tool-augmented Language Models (TaLMs) can invoke external tools to solve problems beyond their parametric capacity. However, it remains unclear whether these tool-enabled gains reflect trustworthy reasoning. Focusing on the Code Interpreter tool, we show that even when tools are selected and executed correctly, TaLMs treat tool outputs as substitutes for reasoning, producing solutions that appear correct but lack coherent justification. We term this failure mode Tool-Induced Myopia (TIM), and study it using PYMATH, a benchmark of 1,679 competition-level mathematical problems for which Python code is helpful but not sufficient. We further develop a multi-dimensional evaluation suite to quantify reasoning degradation in TaLMs relative to their non-tool counterparts. Our findings reveal that while TaLMs achieve up to a 19.3 percentage point gain in final-answer accuracy, their reasoning behavior consistently deteriorates (e.g., non-tool LLMs win up to 41.5% more often in pairwise comparisons of the reasoning process). This degradation intensifies with tool use; the more frequently a model invokes tools, the less coherent its reasoning becomes. Moreover, tool use shifts errors from arithmetic mistakes toward global reasoning failures (logic, assumption, creativity); with TIM present in ~55% of high-risk cases. Finally, we propose a preference-optimization-based framework that realigns TaLMs to use tools as assistive evidence, improving both final-answer accuracy and reasoning depth under tool use. Codes and data are available at: https://github.com/megagonlabs/TIM.

Result: GPT-4o、GPT-4、Claude 3.5等专有模型在跨语言任务中表现最佳，但在文化细微理解和形态学泛化方面仍有显著差距；开源模型在流畅度和准确性上大幅落后；所有模型在土耳其语粘着形态和粤语口语表达方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在低资源语言中仍有改进空间，需要开发更具文化意识和语言泛化能力的模型，基准数据已发布以促进可复现性和进一步研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in high-resource languages like English, yet their effectiveness in low-resource and morphologically rich languages remains underexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of seven cutting-edge LLMs -- including GPT-4o, GPT-4, Claude~3.5~Sonnet, LLaMA~3.1, Mistral~Large~2, LLaMA-2~Chat~13B, and Mistral~7B~Instruct -- on a new cross-lingual benchmark covering \textbf{Cantonese, Japanese, and Turkish}. Our benchmark spans four diverse tasks: open-domain question answering, document summarization, English-to-X translation, and culturally grounded dialogue. We combine \textbf{human evaluations} (rating fluency, factual accuracy, and cultural appropriateness) with automated metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) to assess model performance.
  Our results reveal that while the largest proprietary models (GPT-4o, GPT-4, Claude~3.5) generally lead across languages and tasks, significant gaps persist in culturally nuanced understanding and morphological generalization. Notably, GPT-4o demonstrates robust multilingual performance even on cross-lingual tasks, and Claude~3.5~Sonnet achieves competitive accuracy on knowledge and reasoning benchmarks. However, all models struggle to some extent with the unique linguistic challenges of each language, such as Turkish agglutinative morphology and Cantonese colloquialisms. Smaller open-source models (LLaMA-2~13B, Mistral~7B) lag substantially in fluency and accuracy, highlighting the resource disparity. We provide detailed quantitative results, qualitative error analysis, and discuss implications for developing more culturally aware and linguistically generalizable LLMs. Our benchmark and evaluation data are released to foster reproducibility and further research.

Evaluations show our method significantly improves structural and content diversity while maintaining comparable generation efficiency. Furthermore, we conduct a case study showcasing the effectiveness of our method in generating diverse test cases for testing open-source libraries.

Motivation: 防护模型对表面语言变化的敏感性是其关键弱点，即使意义保持不变的释义也会导致安全评分大幅波动，表明缺乏语义基础。

Method: 使用释义集合通过新颖的偏斜感知聚合策略来强制预测一致性，用于鲁棒目标计算。

Result: 方法在六个开源防护模型上减少语义变异性约58%，平均提高基准准确率约2.5%，并能泛化到未见过的风格变化。

Conclusion: 将语义一致性作为首要训练目标具有重要价值，为构建更可靠的防护模型提供了可扩展的方案，并揭示了模型校准与一致性之间的双向关系。

Abstract: Guard models are a critical component of LLM safety, but their sensitivity to superficial linguistic variations remains a key vulnerability. We show that even meaning-preserving paraphrases can cause large fluctuations in safety scores, revealing a lack of semantic grounding. To address this, we introduce a practical, self-supervised framework for improving the semantic robustness of guard models. Our method leverages paraphrase sets to enforce prediction consistency using a novel, skew-aware aggregation strategy for robust target computation. Notably, we find that standard aggregation methods like mean and median can degrade safety, underscoring the need for skew-aware alternatives. We analyze six open-source guard models and show that our approach reduces semantic variability across paraphrases by ~58%, improves benchmark accuracy by ~2.5% on average, and generalizes to unseen stylistic variations. Intriguingly, we discover a bidirectional relationship between model calibration and consistency: our robustness training improves calibration by up to 40%, revealing a fundamental connection between these properties. These results highlight the value of treating semantic consistency as a first-class training objective and provide a scalable recipe for building more reliable guard models.

Motivation: 当前LLMs虽然预测准确率高，但正确性不等于真正理解。需要评估模型是否能在多个实例和多样化领域中做出基于相关决策因素的一致决策。

Method: 引入STaDS框架，通过15个多样化决策场景对9个前沿LLMs进行评估，从问题理解、知识预测和决策因素依赖三个维度联合评估理解能力。

Result: 大多数模型在多样化领域中难以保持一致的强准确性；模型可能准确但全局不忠实，预测驱动因素与陈述理由经常不匹配。

Conclusion: 需要超越准确性的全局理解评估协议，开发新框架来增强LLMs的理解能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often achieve impressive predictive accuracy, yet correctness alone does not imply genuine understanding. True LLM understanding, analogous to human expertise, requires making consistent, well-founded decisions across multiple instances and diverse domains, relying on relevant and domain-grounded decision factors. We introduce Structured Tabular Decision Simulations (STaDS), a suite of expert-like decision settings that evaluate LLMs as if they were professionals undertaking structured decision ``exams''. In this context, understanding is defined as the ability to identify and rely on the correct decision factors, features that determine outcomes within a domain. STaDS jointly assesses understanding through: (i) question and instruction comprehension, (ii) knowledge-based prediction, and (iii) reliance on relevant decision factors. By analyzing 9 frontier LLMs across 15 diverse decision settings, we find that (a) most models struggle to achieve consistently strong accuracy across diverse domains; (b) models can be accurate yet globally unfaithful, and there are frequent mismatches between stated rationales and factors driving predictions. Our findings highlight the need for global-level understanding evaluation protocols and advocate for novel frameworks that go beyond accuracy to enhance LLMs' understanding ability.

Abstract: Cochlear implants (CI) significantly improve spoken language in children with severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), yet outcomes remain more variable than in children with normal hearing. This variability cannot be reliably predicted for individual children using age at implantation or residual hearing. This study aims to compare the accuracy of traditional machine learning (ML) to deep transfer learning (DTL) algorithms to predict post-CI spoken language development of children with bilateral SNHL using a binary classification model of high versus low language improvers. A total of 278 implanted children enrolled from three centers. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of prediction models based upon brain neuroanatomic features using traditional ML and DTL learning. DTL prediction models using bilinear attention-based fusion strategy achieved: accuracy of 92.39% (95% CI, 90.70%-94.07%), sensitivity of 91.22% (95% CI, 89.98%-92.47%), specificity of 93.56% (95% CI, 90.91%-96.21%), and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.977 (95% CI, 0.969-0.986). DTL outperformed traditional ML models in all outcome measures. DTL was significantly improved by direct capture of discriminative and task-specific information that are advantages of representation learning enabled by this approach over ML. The results support the feasibility of a single DTL prediction model for language prediction of children served by CI programs worldwide.

Abstract: Code-switching (CS) speech translation (ST) refers to translating speech that alternates between two or more languages into a target language text, which poses significant challenges due to the complexity of semantic modeling and the scarcity of CS data. Previous studies tend to rely on the model itself to implicitly learn semantic modeling during training, and resort to inefficient and costly manual annotations for these two challenges. To mitigate these limitations, we propose enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) speech projector, where each expert specializes in the semantic subspace of a specific language, enabling fine-grained modeling of speech features. Additionally, we introduce a multi-stage training paradigm that utilizes readily available monolingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) and monolingual ST data, facilitating speech-text alignment and improving translation capabilities. During training, we leverage a combination of language-specific loss and intra-group load balancing loss to guide the MoE speech projector in efficiently allocating tokens to the appropriate experts, across expert groups and within each group, respectively. To bridge the data gap across different training stages and improve adaptation to the CS scenario, we further employ a transition loss, enabling smooth transitions of data between stages, to effectively address the scarcity of high-quality CS speech translation data. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our approach.

*Filippo Morbiato,Luca Romano,Alessandro Persona*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GVF Finetuning通过事实锚点数据增强、事实感知指令调优和事实一致性损失函数三个核心机制，系统性地增强多模态大语言模型的视觉事实一致性，有效减少视觉幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型中的视觉幻觉问题严重影响了其可靠性，现有的微调方法改进有限，无法深入干预事实推理过程。

Method: 1. 事实锚点数据增强：用结构化事实锚点和反事实提示丰富训练数据；2. 事实感知指令调优：将事实线索嵌入显式指令；3. 事实一致性损失函数：专门惩罚事实不准确性。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-13B模型上，GVF微调在VHTest基准测试中显著优于标准微调，在开放式问题和是/否问题上都表现出色，同时在MME和POPE等多模态基准上保持或略有提升性能。

Conclusion: GVF微调能有效缓解视觉幻觉问题，同时不损害模型的一般理解和推理能力，为提升多模态模型的事实可靠性提供了系统解决方案。

Abstract: Visual hallucination, where Multimodal Large Language Models fabricate details inconsistent with image content, critically undermines their reliability. Existing fine-tuning methods offer limited improvement, failing to deeply intervene in factual reasoning. This paper introduces Grounded Visual Factualization (GVF) Finetuning, a novel approach to systematically enhance MLLM visual factual consistency. GVF integrates explicit factual signals via three core mechanisms: Factual Anchor Data Augmentation, enriching training data with structured factual anchors and counter-factual prompts; Fact-Aware Instruction Tuning, embedding these cues into explicit instructions; and a Factual Consistency Loss function, specifically penalizing factual inaccuracies. Evaluated on LLaVA-1.5-13B, GVF Finetuning significantly outperforms standard fine-tuning on the VHTest benchmark for both Open-Ended Question (OEQ) and Yes/No Question (YNQ) formats. Crucially, GVF maintains or even slightly improves performance on general multimodal benchmarks like MME and POPE, demonstrating effective mitigation of visual hallucinations without compromising general understanding and reasoning abilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming materials science. This review examines recent LLM applications across the materials discovery pipeline, focusing on three key areas: mining scientific literature , predictive modelling, and multi-agent experimental systems. We highlight how LLMs extract valuable information such as synthesis conditions from text, learn structure-property relationships, and can coordinate agentic systems integrating computational tools and laboratory automation. While progress has been largely dependent on closed-source commercial models, our benchmark results demonstrate that open-source alternatives can match performance while offering greater transparency, reproducibility, cost-effectiveness, and data privacy. As open-source models continue to improve, we advocate their broader adoption to build accessible, flexible, and community-driven AI platforms for scientific discovery.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在文本到SQL任务中难以处理数据库特定模式和隐式领域知识，需要一种能够从人类反馈中持续学习的方法。

Method: 设计了多种学习代理架构变体，包括过程代理，通过结构化记忆捕获和检索过往经验，从人类自然语言反馈中提炼知识。

Conclusion: 将隐性人类专业知识转化为可重用知识对于构建更适应性强、领域感知的文本到SQL系统至关重要，这些系统能够从人类在环中持续学习。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate SQL queries from natural language questions but struggle with database-specific schemas and tacit domain knowledge. We introduce a framework for continual learning from human feedback in text-to-SQL, where a learning agent receives natural language feedback to refine queries and distills the revealed knowledge for reuse on future tasks. This distilled knowledge is stored in a structured memory, enabling the agent to improve execution accuracy over time. We design and evaluate multiple variations of a learning agent architecture that vary in how they capture and retrieve past experiences. Experiments on the BIRD benchmark Dev set show that memory-augmented agents, particularly the Procedural Agent, achieve significant accuracy gains and error reduction by leveraging human-in-the-loop feedback. Our results highlight the importance of transforming tacit human expertise into reusable knowledge, paving the way for more adaptive, domain-aware text-to-SQL systems that continually learn from a human-in-the-loop.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE模型专家预测方法使用前一层的激活值导致准确率低，且无法优化第一层。复杂预测方法又带来高计算开销。

Method: 利用LLM中某些函数的排序保持特性，使用同层注意力块前的激活值，通过2个线性函数和排序感知损失实现准确预测。

Result: 在DeepSeek V2 Lite上达到93.03%准确率，Qwen3-30B上94.69%，Phi-mini-MoE上97.62%，比现有方法绝对准确率提升约15%。

Conclusion: 预注意力专家路由器实现了准确且轻量的专家预取，支持第一层预取，显著提升了MoE模型的推理效率。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently scale-up the model while keeping relatively low inference cost. As MoE models only activate part of the experts, related work has proposed expert prediction and caching methods to prefetch the experts for faster inference. However, existing approaches utilize the activations from the previous layer for prediction, incurring low accuracy and leave the first layer unoptimized. Applying complex layers or even training standalone networks for better prediction introduces high computation overhead. In this paper, we propose pre-attention expert prediction to achieve accurate and lightweight expert prefetching. The key insight is that some functions in LLMs are ranking-preserving, indicating that matching the ranking of selected experts using simple linear functions is possible. Therefore, we utilize the activations before the attention block in the same layer with 2 linear functions and ranking-aware loss to achieve accurate prediction, which also supports prefetching in the first layer. Our lightweight, pre-attention expert routers achieve 93.03% accuracy on DeepSeek V2 Lite, 94.69% on Qwen3-30B, and 97.62% on Phi-mini-MoE, showing about 15% improvement on absolute accuracy over the state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: SpiderGen是一个基于LLM的工作流，将传统生命周期评估（LCA）与LLM的推理能力相结合，自动生成LCA过程信息，显著降低成本和人力投入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化和温室气体排放主要由消费品生产、使用和处置过程贡献，需要开发工具来评估消费品环境影响，而传统LCA成本高昂且耗时。

Method: 开发SpiderGen工作流，整合传统LCA分类学和方法论与LLM的推理能力和世界知识，生成用于LCA的程序信息。

Result: SpiderGen提供准确LCA过程信息，F1分数达62%，成本低于1美元且10分钟内完成，相比传统LCA（成本超2.5万美元，耗时21人天）显著提升效率。

Conclusion: SpiderGen在减少碳影响评估的人力和成本方面具有巨大潜力，能够以极低成本快速生成LCA过程信息。

Abstract: Investigating the effects of climate change and global warming caused by GHG emissions have been a primary concern worldwide. These emissions are largely contributed to by the production, use and disposal of consumer products. Thus, it is important to build tools to estimate the environmental impact of consumer goods, an essential part of which is conducting Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs). LCAs specify and account for the appropriate processes involved with the production, use, and disposal of the products. We present SpiderGen, an LLM-based workflow which integrates the taxonomy and methodology of traditional LCA with the reasoning capabilities and world knowledge of LLMs to generate the procedural information used for LCA. We additionally evaluate the output of SpiderGen using real-world LCA documents as ground-truth. We find that SpiderGen provides accurate LCA process information that is either fully correct or has minor errors, achieving an F1-Score of 62% across 10 sample data points. We observe that the remaining missed processes and hallucinated errors occur primarily due to differences in detail between LCA documents, as well as differences in the "scope" of which auxiliary processes must also be included. We also demonstrate that SpiderGen performs better than several baselines techniques, such as chain-of-thought prompting and one-shot prompting. Finally, we highlight SpiderGen's potential to reduce the human effort and costs for estimating carbon impact, as it is able to produce LCA process information for less than \$1 USD in under 10 minutes as compared to the status quo LCA, which can cost over \$25000 USD and take up to 21-person days.

Result: 即使小的提示修改也能显著改变攻击成功率，不同对齐方法对提示变异的敏感性不同

Conclusion: 仅运行现有攻击基准测试可能不足以揭示模型和对齐方法的所有漏洞，需要基于统计的系统性分析

Abstract: This work aims to investigate how different Large Language Models (LLMs) alignment methods affect the models' responses to prompt attacks. We selected open source models based on the most common alignment methods, namely, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). We conducted a systematic analysis using statistical methods to verify how sensitive the Attack Success Rate (ASR) is when we apply variations to prompts designed to elicit inappropriate content from LLMs. Our results show that even small prompt modifications can significantly change the Attack Success Rate (ASR) according to the statistical tests we run, making the models more or less susceptible to types of attack. Critically, our results demonstrate that running existing 'attack benchmarks' alone may not be sufficient to elicit all possible vulnerabilities of both models and alignment methods. This paper thus contributes to ongoing efforts on model attack evaluation by means of systematic and statistically-based analyses of the different alignment methods and how sensitive their ASR is to prompt variation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在现实应用中的广泛采用，用户与模型的交互频率和规模不断增加，需要评估模型在交互环境中的鲁棒性，特别是在高风险场景下保持一致性推理的能力。

Method: 使用简单的多轮后续提示评估模型答案变化，通过马尔可夫链建模多轮对话中的准确率动态，并检验线性探针是否能预测这些变化。

Result: 发现LLMs存在显著脆弱性："再想想"提示导致Gemini 1.5 Flash在九轮对话中准确率下降约10%；模型准确率动态可通过马尔可夫链有效建模，预测出Gemini 1.5 Flash的稳态准确率比首轮平均低约8%；线性探针可预测未来答案变化。

Conclusion: 建立了稳态准确率作为交互环境中鲁棒性的原则性度量标准，揭示了模型在重复提问下的脆弱性，解决这种不稳定性对于在高风险和交互环境中部署LLMs至关重要。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are adopted in an increasingly wide range of applications, user-model interactions have grown in both frequency and scale. Consequently, research has focused on evaluating the robustness of LLMs, an essential quality for real-world tasks. In this paper, we employ simple multi-turn follow-up prompts to evaluate models' answer changes, model accuracy dynamics across turns with Markov chains, and examine whether linear probes can predict these changes. Our results show significant vulnerabilities in LLM robustness: a simple "Think again" prompt led to an approximate 10% accuracy drop for Gemini 1.5 Flash over nine turns, while combining this prompt with a semantically equivalent reworded question caused a 7.5% drop for Claude 3.5 Haiku. Additionally, we find that model accuracy across turns can be effectively modeled using Markov chains, enabling the prediction of accuracy probabilities over time. This allows for estimation of the model's stationary (long-run) accuracy, which we find to be on average approximately 8% lower than its first-turn accuracy for Gemini 1.5 Flash. Our results from a model's hidden states also reveal evidence that linear probes can help predict future answer changes. Together, these results establish stationary accuracy as a principled robustness metric for interactive settings and expose the fragility of models under repeated questioning. Addressing this instability will be essential for deploying LLMs in high-stakes and interactive settings where consistent reasoning is as important as initial accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 递归提示虽然能扩展合成数据集生成，但存在偏见放大风险，需要研究偏见动态和有效的缓解策略。

Method: 使用三种评估框架（规则模式匹配、嵌入语义相似性、下游任务性能），在三种初始偏见水平下测试四种缓解策略。

Result: 低初始偏见会放大（+36%），高初始偏见会衰减（-26%），对比增强方法在下游任务中显著降低偏见（平均91%）。

Conclusion: 语义相似性指标可能与行为公平结果背离，需要在负责任合成数据生成中进行多维评估。

Abstract: Recursive prompting with large language models enables scalable synthetic dataset generation but introduces the risk of bias amplification. We investigate gender bias dynamics across three generations of recursive text generation using three complementary evaluation frameworks: rule-based pattern matching, embedding-based semantic similarity, and downstream task performance. Experiments with three initial bias levels (0.1, 0.3, 0.6) and four mitigation strategies reveal equilibrium dynamics rather than monotonic amplification. The low initial bias amplifies toward the model's inherent bias level (+36%), whereas the high initial bias decays toward it (-26%). Among mitigation methods, contrastive augmentation, which introduces gender-swapped variants, achieves significant downstream bias reduction (98.8% for low initial bias and 91% on average) despite producing higher embedding-based bias scores. This paradox demonstrates that semantic similarity metrics may diverge from behavioral fairness outcomes, highlighting the need for multidimensional evaluation in responsible synthetic data generation.

Conclusion: 为多模态系统的可解释性和可控性研究提供了新视角，揭示了超越文本和视觉相似性的意外概念关系。

Abstract: Recent closed-source multimodal systems have made great advances, but their hidden language for understanding the world remains opaque because of their black-box architectures. In this paper, we use the systems' preference bias to study their hidden language: During the process of compressing the input images (typically containing multiple concepts) into texts and then reconstructing them into images, the systems' inherent preference bias introduces specific shifts in the outputs, disrupting the original input concept co-occurrence. We employ the multi-round "telephone game" to strategically leverage this bias. By observing the co-occurrence frequencies of concepts in telephone games, we quantitatively investigate the concept connection strength in the understanding of multimodal systems, i.e., "hidden language." We also contribute Telescope, a dataset of 10,000+ concept pairs, as the database of our telephone game framework. Our telephone game is test-time scalable: By iteratively running telephone games, we can construct a global map of concept connections in multimodal systems' understanding. Here we can identify preference bias inherited from training, assess generalization capability advancement, and discover more stable pathways for fragile concept connections. Furthermore, we use Reasoning-LLMs to uncover unexpected concept relationships that transcend textual and visual similarities, inferring how multimodal systems understand and simulate the world. This study offers a new perspective on the hidden language of multimodal systems and lays the foundation for future research on the interpretability and controllability of multimodal systems.

Motivation: 当前基准测试难以跟上大语言模型发展，存在数据污染问题，且主要假设良性资源丰富环境，缺乏对模型在压力下行为的评估。

Method: 设计包含六个淘汰式关卡的游戏环境，评估指令遵循、代码、推理、规划和安全性等多方面能力，让LLM与其他LLM对手进行交互游戏。

Result: 评估了50多个LLM，观察到同一模型谱系中的性能代际跃迁，发现某些模型采用投机捷径获胜，表明静态基准存在更高级别的评估范式污染。

Conclusion: 动态评估可以作为静态评估的补充部分，Squid Game提供了一个更全面的LLM行为评估框架。

Abstract: Contemporary benchmarks are struggling to keep pace with the development of large language models (LLMs). Although they are indispensable to evaluate model performance on various tasks, it is uncertain whether the models trained on Internet data have genuinely learned how to solve problems or merely seen the questions before. This potential data contamination issue presents a fundamental challenge to establishing trustworthy evaluation frameworks. Meanwhile, existing benchmarks predominantly assume benign, resource-rich settings, leaving the behavior of LLMs under pressure unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Squid Game, a dynamic and adversarial evaluation environment with resource-constrained and asymmetric information settings elaborated to evaluate LLMs through interactive gameplay against other LLM opponents. Notably, Squid Game consists of six elimination-style levels, focusing on multi-faceted abilities, such as instruction-following, code, reasoning, planning, and safety alignment. We evaluate over 50 LLMs on Squid Game, presenting the largest behavioral evaluation study of general LLMs on dynamic adversarial scenarios. We observe a clear generational phase transition on performance in the same model lineage and find evidence that some models resort to speculative shortcuts to win the game, indicating the possibility of higher-level evaluation paradigm contamination in static benchmarks. Furthermore, we compare prominent LLM benchmarks and Squid Game with correlation analyses, highlighting that dynamic evaluation can serve as a complementary part for static evaluations. The code and data will be released in the future.

Motivation: 探讨AI语音系统是否能学习人类社交中非显性编程的隐含线索，特别是通过语速变化传达礼貌这一微妙韵律特征。

Method: 使用22个合成语音（来自AI Studio和OpenAI平台），在"礼貌正式"和"随意非正式"两种条件下朗读固定脚本，测量语音时长。

Result: 两个AI平台的礼貌提示都产生了比随意提示更慢的语速，效应量非常大。AI Studio的所有语音和OpenAI的大多数语音都显示出统计显著性。

Conclusion: AI能够隐式学习和复制人类沟通的心理细微差别，突显其作为能够强化人类社会规范的社会行动者的新兴角色。

Abstract: Voice-based artificial intelligence is increasingly expected to adhere to human social conventions, but can it learn implicit cues that are not explicitly programmed? This study investigates whether state-of-the-art text-to-speech systems have internalized the human tendency to reduce speech rate to convey politeness - a non-obvious prosodic marker. We prompted 22 synthetic voices from two leading AI platforms (AI Studio and OpenAI) to read a fixed script under both "polite and formal" and "casual and informal" conditions and measured the resulting speech duration. Across both AI platforms, the polite prompt produced slower speech than the casual prompt with very large effect sizes, an effect that was statistically significant for all of AI Studio's voices and for a large majority of OpenAI's voices. These results demonstrate that AI can implicitly learn and replicate psychological nuances of human communication, highlighting its emerging role as a social actor capable of reinforcing human social norms.

Result: 在Llama系列模型中发现一致的起始点，多跳任务也显示相似的起始位置。

Conclusion: 提供了一种简单可复现的方法来定位指令跟随的起始位置，并比较不同任务和模型规模下的差异。

Abstract: Following an instruction involves distinct sub-processes, such as reading content, reading the instruction, executing it, and producing an answer. We ask where, along the layer stack, instruction following begins, the point where reading gives way to doing. We introduce three simple datasets (Key-Value, Quote Attribution, Letter Selection) and two hop compositions of these tasks. Using activation patching on minimal-contrast prompt pairs, we measure a layer-wise flip rate that indicates when substituting selected residual activations changes the predicted answer. Across models in the Llama family, we observe an inflection point, which we term onset, where interventions that change predictions before this point become largely ineffective afterward. Multi-hop compositions show a similar onset location. These results provide a simple, replicable way to locate where instruction following begins and to compare this location across tasks and model sizes.

Conclusion: LLM的国家层面偏见具有多维性和情境依赖性，在将LLM应用于国际关系领域时，必须同时评估其偏见程度和性能表现。结合检索增强生成和反思技术的去偏见方法能有效改善这一问题。

Abstract: This paper systematically examines nation-level biases exhibited by Large Language Models (LLMs) within the domain of International Relations (IR). Leveraging historical records from the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), we developed a bias evaluation framework comprising three distinct tests to explore nation-level bias in various LLMs, with a particular focus on the five permanent members of the UNSC. Experimental results show that, even with the general bias patterns across models (e.g., favorable biases toward the western nations, and unfavorable biases toward Russia), these still vary based on the LLM. Notably, even within the same LLM, the direction and magnitude of bias for a nation change depending on the evaluation context. This observation suggests that LLM biases are fundamentally multidimensional, varying across models and tasks. We also observe that models with stronger reasoning abilities show reduced bias and better performance. Building on this finding, we introduce a debiasing framework that improves LLMs' factual reasoning combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Reflexion-based self-reflection techniques. Experiments show it effectively reduces nation-level bias, and improves performance, particularly in GPT-4o-mini and LLama-3.3-70B. Our findings emphasize the need to assess nation-level bias alongside performance when applying LLMs in the IR domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer的二次复杂度限制了长序列建模能力，现有稀疏注意力机制如RingAttention虽然降低了计算成本，但感受野有限且缺乏适应性。

Method: 提出ΠAttention，将注意力分解为环局部邻域、确定性π步长跳跃和自适应融合门，周期性结构提供对远处token的预测覆盖，稀疏足迹保持每层复杂度线性。

Result: 在语言建模、检索和视觉语言任务中，ΠAttention匹配或超越密集注意力质量，比RingAttention困惑度降低8.3%，相同上下文长度下GPU使用减少50%。

Conclusion: 周期性跳跃、自适应融合和头级稀疏协调对于高效长上下文建模至关重要，ΠAttention在保持线性复杂度的同时显著扩展了感受野。

Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized natural language processing, but their quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length remains a fundamental bottleneck for long-range modeling. While sparse attention mechanisms like RingAttention reduce computational costs by restricting attention to local neighborhoods, they suffer from limited receptive fields and lack of adaptability. We present \PiAttention, a periodic sparse Transformer that factorizes attention into ring-local neighborhoods, deterministic $π$-stride skips, and an adaptive fusion gate. The periodic structure provides predictable coverage of distant tokens, while the sparse footprint keeps the per-layer complexity linear in context length. We prove that \PiAttention achieves $\mathcal{O}(kL + π\log L)$ receptive field growth compared to $\mathcal{O}(kL)$ for RingAttention, where $k$ is the local window size, $π$ is the skip period, and $L$ is the sequence length. Extensive experiments on language modeling, retrieval, and vision-language tasks demonstrate that \PiAttention matches or surpasses dense attention quality with 8.3\% lower perplexity than RingAttention while using 50\% fewer GPUs for the same context length. Our detailed ablations and visualizations reveal the importance of periodic skips, adaptive fusion, and head-level sparsity coordination for efficient long-context modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 消费者健康问题摘要可以简化医疗沟通，但不忠实的摘要会误传医疗细节，带来严重风险，需要提升医疗摘要的忠实度。

Method: 结合TextRank句子提取和医疗命名实体识别，在LLaMA-2-7B模型上微调，使用MeQSum和BanglaCHQ-Summ数据集。

Result: 在质量指标（ROUGE、BERTScore、可读性）和忠实度指标（SummaC、AlignScore）上均取得一致改进，超过零样本基线和先前系统，80%以上生成摘要保留关键医疗信息。

Conclusion: 忠实度是可靠医疗摘要的关键维度，该方法展示了在医疗环境中更安全部署LLMs的潜力。

Abstract: Summarizing consumer health questions (CHQs) can ease communication in healthcare, but unfaithful summaries that misrepresent medical details pose serious risks. We propose a framework that combines TextRank-based sentence extraction and medical named entity recognition with large language models (LLMs) to enhance faithfulness in medical text summarization. In our experiments, we fine-tuned the LLaMA-2-7B model on the MeQSum (English) and BanglaCHQ-Summ (Bangla) datasets, achieving consistent improvements across quality (ROUGE, BERTScore, readability) and faithfulness (SummaC, AlignScore) metrics, and outperforming zero-shot baselines and prior systems. Human evaluation further shows that over 80\% of generated summaries preserve critical medical information. These results highlight faithfulness as an essential dimension for reliable medical summarization and demonstrate the potential of our approach for safer deployment of LLMs in healthcare contexts.

Result: GPT-4o与人类评分员达到强相关性（最高0.98），55%的测验案例得分完全一致。项目报告评分也显示整体良好对齐，但在技术性、开放性回答的评分上存在一定变异性。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了基于LLM的评分系统在真实学术环境中的潜力和局限性，并发布了所有代码和样本数据以支持教育评估领域的进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored for educational tasks such as grading, yet their alignment with human evaluation in real classrooms remains underexamined. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using an LLM (GPT-4o) to evaluate short-answer quizzes and project reports in an undergraduate Computational Linguistics course. We collect responses from approximately 50 students across five quizzes and receive project reports from 14 teams. LLM-generated scores are compared against human evaluations conducted independently by the course teaching assistants (TAs). Our results show that GPT-4o achieves strong correlation with human graders (up to 0.98) and exact score agreement in 55\% of quiz cases. For project reports, it also shows strong overall alignment with human grading, while exhibiting some variability in scoring technical, open-ended responses. We release all code and sample data to support further research on LLMs in educational assessment. This work highlights both the potential and limitations of LLM-based grading systems and contributes to advancing automated grading in real-world academic settings.

Motivation: 探索多语言大语言模型如何内部表示不同语言，以及为什么性能仍然偏向主导训练语言，理解多语言对齐机制。

Method: 训练一系列不同多语言数据混合的LLM，使用跨层转码器和归因图分析内部机制，通过干预语言特征进行实验。

Result: 发现枢纽语言表示机制：模型跨语言使用几乎相同的表示，语言特定解码出现在后期层；归因分析显示解码依赖少量高频语言特征；通过干预特征可以控制语言输出。

Conclusion: 理解枢纽语言机制对于改进LLM中的多语言对齐至关重要，这揭示了模型如何在不同语言间共享表示并进行语言特定解码。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) can process many languages, yet how they internally represent this diversity remains unclear. Do they form shared multilingual representations with language-specific decoding, and if so, why does performance still favor the dominant training language? To address this, we train a series of LLMs on different mixtures of multilingual data and analyze their internal mechanisms using cross-layer transcoders (CLT) and attribution graphs. Our results provide strong evidence for pivot language representations: the model employs nearly identical representations across languages, while language-specific decoding emerges in later layers. Attribution analyses reveal that decoding relies in part on a small set of high-frequency language features in the final layers, which linearly read out language identity from the first layers in the model. By intervening on these features, we can suppress one language and substitute another in the model's outputs. Finally, we study how the dominant training language influences these mechanisms across attribution graphs and decoding pathways. We argue that understanding this pivot-language mechanism is crucial for improving multilingual alignment in LLMs.

TL;DR: 研究发现情感识别模型在非洲裔美国白话英语(AAVE)上存在系统性偏见，愤怒情绪误报率是通用美式英语的两倍以上，可能强化种族刻板印象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感检测模型主要基于主流文化标注，无法准确识别被排除在训练数据之外的方言表达，如AAVE，这在高风险领域如心理健康和招聘中可能带来安全问题。

Method: 分析270万条洛杉矶地理标记推文，计算AAVE方言特征强度，由875条高/低AAVE密度推文的群体内标注者进行情感标注，比较GPT、BERT和SpanEmo模型在不同方言上的表现。

Result: 模型在AAVE上的愤怒情绪误报率是GAE的两倍以上(SpanEmo从25%升至60%)，模型预测与非群体内标注更相关于粗俗语特征，非洲裔居民比例高的社区愤怒预测更高(r=0.27)、快乐预测更低(r=-0.10)。

Conclusion: 情感AI存在强化种族刻板印象的安全问题，需要开发文化和方言感知的情感计算系统。

Abstract: Automated emotion detection is widely used in applications ranging from well-being monitoring to high-stakes domains like mental health and hiring. However, models often rely on annotations that reflect dominant cultural norms, limiting model ability to recognize emotional expression in dialects often excluded from training data distributions, such as African American Vernacular English (AAVE). This study examines emotion recognition model performance on AAVE compared to General American English (GAE). We analyze 2.7 million tweets geo-tagged within Los Angeles. Texts are scored for strength of AAVE using computational approximations of dialect features. Annotations of emotion presence and intensity are collected on a dataset of 875 tweets with both high and low AAVE densities. To assess model accuracy on a task as subjective as emotion perception, we calculate community-informed "silver" labels where AAVE-dense tweets are labeled by African American, AAVE-fluent (ingroup) annotators. On our labeled sample, GPT and BERT-based models exhibit false positive prediction rates of anger on AAVE more than double than on GAE. SpanEmo, a popular text-based emotion model, increases false positive rates of anger from 25 percent on GAE to 60 percent on AAVE. Additionally, a series of linear regressions reveals that models and non-ingroup annotations are significantly more correlated with profanity-based AAVE features than ingroup annotations. Linking Census tract demographics, we observe that neighborhoods with higher proportions of African American residents are associated with higher predictions of anger (Pearson's correlation r = 0.27) and lower joy (r = -0.10). These results find an emergent safety issue of emotion AI reinforcing racial stereotypes through biased emotion classification. We emphasize the need for culturally and dialect-informed affective computing systems.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过参数空间对齐来改进任务算术的方法，解决了LLM之间技能转移时的负干扰问题，在推理基准测试中表现优于标准任务算术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 任务算术在大型语言模型之间转移技能时经常因训练过程中的模型差异而产生负干扰，这限制了技能的有效转移。

Method: 首先利用Transformer架构固有的排列、旋转和缩放对称性来对齐模型的参数空间，特别针对现代GQA和SwiGLU层进行了适配，探索了基于权重和基于激活的方法。

Result: 在具有挑战性的推理基准测试中，该方法始终优于标准任务算术，成功将高级推理技能转移到了非推理模型中。

Conclusion: 这项工作为在演进的LLM家族之间合并和转移专门技能提供了有效方法，减少了冗余的微调并增强了模型的适应性。

Abstract: Task arithmetic is a powerful technique for transferring skills between Large Language Models (LLMs), but it often suffers from negative interference when models have diverged during training. We address this limitation by first aligning the models' parameter spaces, leveraging the inherent permutation, rotation, and scaling symmetries of Transformer architectures. We adapt parameter space alignment for modern Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) and SwiGLU layers, exploring both weight-based and activation-based approaches. Using this alignment-first strategy, we successfully transfer advanced reasoning skills to a non-reasoning model. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms standard task arithmetic. This work provides an effective approach for merging and transferring specialized skills across evolving LLM families, reducing redundant fine-tuning and enhancing model adaptability.

Motivation: 探究LLM在需要社交或对话判断的任务中是否能可靠评估，特别是当任务从直接事实查询转变为对话式判断任务时。

Method: 通过对比模型在直接事实查询和最小对话场景中的表现，并在两种条件下施加简单的反驳压力来测量模型立场的坚定性。

Result: GPT-4o-mini在社交框架任务中表现出顺从倾向，而Llama-8B-Instruct变得过于挑剔，所有模型平均性能变化为9.24%。

Conclusion: 即使是最小的对话上下文也能显著改变模型判断，对话框架是LLM评估的关键因素，该框架为诊断模型信念提供了可复制方法。

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly employed as judges across a variety of tasks, including those involving everyday social interactions. Yet, it remains unclear whether such LLM-judges can reliably assess tasks that require social or conversational judgment. We investigate how an LLM's conviction is changed when a task is reframed from a direct factual query to a Conversational Judgment Task. Our evaluation framework contrasts the model's performance on direct factual queries with its assessment of a speaker's correctness when the same information is presented within a minimal dialogue, effectively shifting the query from "Is this statement correct?" to "Is this speaker correct?". Furthermore, we apply pressure in the form of a simple rebuttal ("The previous answer is incorrect.") to both conditions. This perturbation allows us to measure how firmly the model maintains its position under conversational pressure. Our findings show that while some models like GPT-4o-mini reveal sycophantic tendencies under social framing tasks, others like Llama-8B-Instruct become overly-critical. We observe an average performance change of 9.24% across all models, demonstrating that even minimal dialogue context can significantly alter model judgment, underscoring conversational framing as a key factor in LLM-based evaluation. The proposed framework offers a reproducible methodology for diagnosing model conviction and contributes to the development of more trustworthy dialogue systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous in everyday life and are entering higher-stakes applications ranging from summarizing meeting transcripts to answering doctors' questions. As was the case with earlier predictive models, it is crucial that we develop tools for explaining the output of LLMs, be it a summary, list, response to a question, etc. With these needs in mind, we introduce In-Context Explainability 360 (ICX360), an open-source Python toolkit for explaining LLMs with a focus on the user-provided context (or prompts in general) that are fed to the LLMs. ICX360 contains implementations for three recent tools that explain LLMs using both black-box and white-box methods (via perturbations and gradients respectively). The toolkit, available at https://github.com/IBM/ICX360, contains quick-start guidance materials as well as detailed tutorials covering use cases such as retrieval augmented generation, natural language generation, and jailbreaking.

Method: 引入构建评估集的流程，系统地将数据集分为三个子集（正确、错误、知识不足），分析不同提示场景下负向偏见的变化。

Conclusion: 揭示了影响负向偏见的各种因素，为减轻LLMs中的负向偏见提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Negative bias refers to the tendency of large language models (LLMs) to excessively generate negative responses in binary decision tasks (e.g., yes-no question answering). Previous research has focused on detecting and addressing negative attention heads that induce negative bias. However, the underlying detailed factors influencing negative bias remain underexplored. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs exhibit format-level negative bias, meaning the prompt format more influences their responses than the semantics of the negative response. For the fine-grained study of the negative bias, we introduce a pipeline for constructing the evaluation set, which systematically categorizes the dataset into three subsets based on the model's parametric knowledge: correct, incorrect, and insufficient relevant knowledge. Through analysis of this evaluation set, we identify a shortcut behavior in which models tend to generate negative responses when they lack sufficient knowledge to answer a yes-no question, leading to negative bias. We further examine how negative bias changes under various prompting scenarios related to parametric knowledge. We observe that providing relevant context and offering an "I don't know" option generally reduces negative bias, whereas chain-of-thought prompting tends to amplify the bias. Finally, we demonstrate that the degree of negative bias can vary depending on the type of prompt, which influences the direction of the response. Our work reveals the various factors that influence negative bias, providing critical insights for mitigating it in LLMs.

Conclusion: 结合领域专业知识和认证级别能显著提升LLM在医疗问答中的性能，特别是在高风险医疗环境中。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical question answering, yet they often overlook the domain-specific expertise that professionals depend on, such as the clinical subject areas (e.g., trauma, airway) and the certification level (e.g., EMT, Paramedic). Existing approaches typically apply general-purpose prompting or retrieval strategies without leveraging this structured context, limiting performance in high-stakes settings. We address this gap with EMSQA, an 24.3K-question multiple-choice dataset spanning 10 clinical subject areas and 4 certification levels, accompanied by curated, subject area-aligned knowledge bases (40K documents and 2M tokens). Building on EMSQA, we introduce (i) Expert-CoT, a prompting strategy that conditions chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning on specific clinical subject area and certification level, and (ii) ExpertRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline that grounds responses in subject area-aligned documents and real-world patient data. Experiments on 4 LLMs show that Expert-CoT improves up to 2.05% over vanilla CoT prompting. Additionally, combining Expert-CoT with ExpertRAG yields up to a 4.59% accuracy gain over standard RAG baselines. Notably, the 32B expertise-augmented LLMs pass all the computer-adaptive EMS certification simulation exams.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for automating academic workflows, existing systems for academic peer review remain constrained by text-only inputs, limited contextual grounding, and a lack of actionable feedback. In this work, we present an interactive web-based system for multimodal, community-aware peer review simulation to enable effective manuscript revisions before paper submission. Our framework integrates textual and visual information through multimodal LLMs, enhances review quality via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) grounded in web-scale OpenReview data, and converts generated reviews into actionable to-do lists using the proposed Action:Objective[\#] format, providing structured and traceable guidance. The system integrates seamlessly into existing academic writing platforms, providing interactive interfaces for real-time feedback and revision tracking. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed system in generating more comprehensive and useful reviews aligned with expert standards, surpassing ablated baselines and advancing transparent, human-centered scholarly assistance.

Motivation: 探索如何自动将考试题目和学习成果按照Bloom分类法进行准确分类，比较不同机器学习方法在有限数据集上的表现，为教育技术中的自动分类提供实践指导。

Method: 使用600句标注数据，测试了传统ML（朴素贝叶斯、逻辑回归、SVM）、RNN（LSTM、BiLSTM、GRU、BiGRU）、Transformer（BERT、RoBERTa）和LLM（OpenAI、Gemini等）模型，采用不同预处理和数据增强策略。

Conclusion: 在有限数据下，复杂深度学习模型容易过拟合，而精心设计的数据增强和简单算法（如增强SVM）在Bloom分类法分类中表现更优，为小数据集分类任务提供了实用指导。

Abstract: This paper explores the automatic classification of exam questions and learning outcomes according to Bloom's Taxonomy. A small dataset of 600 sentences labeled with six cognitive categories - Knowledge, Comprehension, Application, Analysis, Synthesis, and Evaluation - was processed using traditional machine learning (ML) models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines), recurrent neural network architectures (LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, BiGRU), transformer-based models (BERT and RoBERTa), and large language models (OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, Anthropic). Each model was evaluated under different preprocessing and augmentation strategies (for example, synonym replacement, word embeddings, etc.). Among traditional ML approaches, Support Vector Machines (SVM) with data augmentation achieved the best overall performance, reaching 94 percent accuracy, recall, and F1 scores with minimal overfitting. In contrast, the RNN models and BERT suffered from severe overfitting, while RoBERTa initially overcame it but began to show signs as training progressed. Finally, zero-shot evaluations of large language models (LLMs) indicated that OpenAI and Gemini performed best among the tested LLMs, achieving approximately 0.72-0.73 accuracy and comparable F1 scores. These findings highlight the challenges of training complex deep models on limited data and underscore the value of careful data augmentation and simpler algorithms (such as augmented SVM) for Bloom's Taxonomy classification.

TL;DR: DiscoX是一个用于评估专业领域中文-英文篇章级翻译的新基准，包含7个领域的200篇专业文本。同时开发了无参考评估系统Metric-S，实验显示即使最先进的LLM仍与人类专家存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前翻译评估方法主要关注句子级别的准确性和流畅性，无法充分评估专业领域篇章级翻译所需的连贯性和术语精确性。

Method: 构建DiscoX基准数据集（200篇专业文本，平均长度超过1700词），开发无参考评估系统Metric-S进行细粒度自动评估。

Result: Metric-S与人类判断高度一致，显著优于现有评估指标。实验显示最先进的LLM在专业翻译任务上仍明显落后于人类专家。

Conclusion: DiscoX基准和Metric-S评估系统为更严格的翻译评估提供了可靠框架，揭示了实现专业级机器翻译仍面临的挑战。

Abstract: The evaluation of discourse-level translation in expert domains remains inadequate, despite its centrality to knowledge dissemination and cross-lingual scholarly communication. While these translations demand discourse-level coherence and strict terminological precision, current evaluation methods predominantly focus on segment-level accuracy and fluency. To address this limitation, we introduce DiscoX, a new benchmark for discourse-level and expert-level Chinese-English translation. It comprises 200 professionally-curated texts from 7 domains, with an average length exceeding 1700 tokens. To evaluate performance on DiscoX, we also develop Metric-S, a reference-free system that provides fine-grained automatic assessments across accuracy, fluency, and appropriateness. Metric-S demonstrates strong consistency with human judgments, significantly outperforming existing metrics. Our experiments reveal a remarkable performance gap: even the most advanced LLMs still trail human experts on these tasks. This finding validates the difficulty of DiscoX and underscores the challenges that remain in achieving professional-grade machine translation. The proposed benchmark and evaluation system provide a robust framework for more rigorous evaluation, facilitating future advancements in LLM-based translation.

Motivation: 目前大多数前沿LLM不公开其偏好对数据，而开源DPO数据集缺乏系统比较，难以理解偏好选择方式、任务类型覆盖范围以及人类判断的反映程度。

Method: 使用Magpie框架对每个样本进行任务类别、输入质量和偏好奖励的标注，实现可扩展的细粒度偏好质量检查，并基于分析结果从五个语料库中精选构建UltraMix混合数据集。

Conclusion: 通过数据中心的偏好优化方法，可以构建更高效的DPO训练数据集，为未来研究提供有价值的资源和方向。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) is a central objective of post-training, often achieved through reward modeling and reinforcement learning methods. Among these, direct preference optimization (DPO) has emerged as a widely adopted technique that fine-tunes LLMs on preferred completions over less favorable ones. While most frontier LLMs do not disclose their curated preference pairs, the broader LLM community has released several open-source DPO datasets, including TuluDPO, ORPO, UltraFeedback, HelpSteer, and Code-Preference-Pairs. However, systematic comparisons remain scarce, largely due to the high computational cost and the lack of rich quality annotations, making it difficult to understand how preferences were selected, which task types they span, and how well they reflect human judgment on a per-sample level. In this work, we present the first comprehensive, data-centric analysis of popular open-source DPO corpora. We leverage the Magpie framework to annotate each sample for task category, input quality, and preference reward, a reward-model-based signal that validates the preference order without relying on human annotations. This enables a scalable, fine-grained inspection of preference quality across datasets, revealing structural and qualitative discrepancies in reward margins. Building on these insights, we systematically curate a new DPO mixture, UltraMix, that draws selectively from all five corpora while removing noisy or redundant samples. UltraMix is 30% smaller than the best-performing individual dataset yet exceeds its performance across key benchmarks. We publicly release all annotations, metadata, and our curated mixture to facilitate future research in data-centric preference optimization.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We find that current text embedding models produce outputs with a consistent bias, i.e., each embedding vector $e$ can be decomposed as $\tilde{e} + μ$, where $μ$ is almost identical across all sentences. We propose a plug-and-play, training-free and lightweight solution called Renormalization. Through extensive experiments, we show that renormalization consistently and statistically significantly improves the performance of existing models on the Massive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark (MMTEB). In particular, across 38 models, renormalization improves performance by 9.7 $σ$ on retrieval tasks, 3.1 $σ$ on classification tasks, and 0.8 $σ$ on other types of tasks. Renormalization has two variants: directly subtracting $μ$ from $e$, or subtracting the projection of $e$ onto $μ$. We theoretically predict that the latter performs better, and our experiments confirm this prediction.

Motivation: 研究LLMs能否检测自身生成的事实幻觉问题

Method: 将幻觉检测定义为句子分类任务，使用思维链(CoT)从模型参数中提取知识

Result: GPT-3.5 Turbo配合CoT能检测58.2%的自身幻觉

Conclusion: 当参数包含足够知识时，带有CoT的LLMs能够检测幻觉

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can generate fluent responses, but sometimes hallucinate facts. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs can detect their own hallucinations. We formulate hallucination detection as a classification task of a sentence. We propose a framework for estimating LLMs' capability of hallucination detection and a classification method using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to extract knowledge from their parameters. The experimental results indicated that GPT-$3.5$ Turbo with CoT detected $58.2\%$ of its own hallucinations. We concluded that LLMs with CoT can detect hallucinations if sufficient knowledge is contained in their parameters.

Motivation: 人身攻击已成为美国总统辩论的显著特征，对选举期间公众认知产生重要影响。检测此类攻击可提高政治话语透明度，为记者、分析师和公众提供洞察。

Method: 对2016、2020和2024年选举周期的辩论记录进行人工标注，然后进行统计和基于语言模型的分析，研究微调transformer模型和通用LLM的检测能力。

Result: 展示了现代语言模型的任务特定适应如何促进对政治传播的深入理解。

Conclusion: 任务特定的现代语言模型适应可以为政治传播提供更深入的理解，自动化检测有害语言的技术进步为政治话语分析创造了新机会。

Abstract: Personal attacks have become a notable feature of U.S. presidential debates and play an important role in shaping public perception during elections. Detecting such attacks can improve transparency in political discourse and provide insights for journalists, analysts and the public. Advances in deep learning and transformer-based models, particularly BERT and large language models (LLMs) have created new opportunities for automated detection of harmful language. Motivated by these developments, we present a framework for analysing personal attacks in U.S. presidential debates. Our work involves manual annotation of debate transcripts across the 2016, 2020 and 2024 election cycles, followed by statistical and language-model based analysis. We investigate the potential of fine-tuned transformer models alongside general-purpose LLMs to detect personal attacks in formal political speech. This study demonstrates how task-specific adaptation of modern language models can contribute to a deeper understanding of political communication.

*Yi Shi,Wenlong Meng,Zhenyuan Guo,Chengkun Wei,Wenzhi Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemoDetector是一个用于表情包情感理解(MEU)的新框架，通过四步文本增强模块和双阶段模态融合策略，显著提升了表情包情感分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交媒体的兴起，表情包已成为表达情感倾向的流行媒介。现有MEU方法面临两个主要挑战：(1)缺乏细粒度的多模态融合策略，(2)对表情包隐含意义和背景知识挖掘不足。

Method: 提出四步文本增强模块，利用多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)逐步推断和提取表情包的隐含和上下文信息；设计双阶段模态融合策略：第一阶段对原始图像和文本进行浅层融合，第二阶段深度融合增强后的视觉和文本特征。

Result: 在MET-MEME和MOOD数据集上的实验表明，MemoDetector持续优于最先进的基线方法，F1分数分别提高了4.3%和3.4%。消融研究和深入分析验证了方法的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MemoDetector通过文本增强和分层融合策略，有效解决了MEU中的关键挑战，展现了推进表情包情感理解的强大潜力。

Abstract: With the rapid rise of social media and Internet culture, memes have become a popular medium for expressing emotional tendencies. This has sparked growing interest in Meme Emotion Understanding (MEU), which aims to classify the emotional intent behind memes by leveraging their multimodal contents. While existing efforts have achieved promising results, two major challenges remain: (1) a lack of fine-grained multimodal fusion strategies, and (2) insufficient mining of memes' implicit meanings and background knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose MemoDetector, a novel framework for advancing MEU. First, we introduce a four-step textual enhancement module that utilizes the rich knowledge and reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to progressively infer and extract implicit and contextual insights from memes. These enhanced texts significantly enrich the original meme contents and provide valuable guidance for downstream classification. Next, we design a dual-stage modal fusion strategy: the first stage performs shallow fusion on raw meme image and text, while the second stage deeply integrates the enhanced visual and textual features. This hierarchical fusion enables the model to better capture nuanced cross-modal emotional cues. Experiments on two datasets, MET-MEME and MOOD, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Specifically, MemoDetector improves F1 scores by 4.3\% on MET-MEME and 3.4\% on MOOD. Further ablation studies and in-depth analyses validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, highlighting its strong potential for advancing MEU.

TL;DR: 提出了SAP²方法，一种两阶段动态修剪和集成相关上下文关键词的框架，用于解决ASR系统在需要领域知识的上下文化场景中利用长上下文信息的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动语音识别系统在常见条件下表现优异，但在需要领域特定知识（如会议演示）的上下文化场景中难以有效利用长上下文信息，主要受限于模型上下文窗口和大量上下文噪声中相关信息稀疏的问题。

Method: SAP²方法采用两阶段动态修剪和集成相关上下文关键词，每个阶段利用提出的语音驱动注意力池化机制，有效压缩上下文嵌入同时保留语音显著性信息。

Result: 在SlideSpeech和LibriSpeech数据集上达到最先进性能，词错误率分别为7.71%和1.12%。在SlideSpeech上，相比非上下文基线，偏置关键词错误率显著降低41.1%。

Conclusion: SAP²方法在广泛上下文输入条件下在两个数据集上都表现出稳健的可扩展性，能持续保持性能。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved remarkable performance in common conditions but often struggle to leverage long-context information in contextualized scenarios that require domain-specific knowledge, such as conference presentations. This challenge arises primarily due to constrained model context windows and the sparsity of relevant information within extensive contextual noise. To solve this, we propose the SAP$^{2}$ method, a novel framework that dynamically prunes and integrates relevant contextual keywords in two stages. Specifically, each stage leverages our proposed Speech-Driven Attention-based Pooling mechanism, enabling efficient compression of context embeddings while preserving speech-salient information. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of SAP$^{2}$ on the SlideSpeech and LibriSpeech datasets, achieving word error rates (WER) of 7.71% and 1.12%, respectively. On SlideSpeech, our method notably reduces biased keyword error rates (B-WER) by 41.1% compared to non-contextual baselines. SAP$^{2}$ also exhibits robust scalability, consistently maintaining performance under extensive contextual input conditions on both datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在零样本和少样本任务中表现优异，但其对语言变体（特别是转述）的鲁棒性研究不足。转述鲁棒性对可靠部署至关重要，尤其是在社会敏感场景中，不一致的表征可能加剧人口统计偏差。

Method: 引入Paraphrase Ranking Stability Metric (PRSM)量化CLIP对转述查询的敏感性，使用Social Counterfactuals数据集评估CLIP在转述变化下的稳定性，分析转述鲁棒性与性别的交互作用。

Result: 鲁棒性随转述策略不同而变化，在男性和女性相关查询中观察到微妙但一致的差异。

Conclusion: 转述鲁棒性变化揭示了CLIP模型在公平性和多模态系统公平部署方面的影响，需要关注模型对社会敏感查询的处理一致性。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) is a widely used multimodal model that aligns text and image representations through large-scale training. While it performs strongly on zero-shot and few-shot tasks, its robustness to linguistic variation, particularly paraphrasing, remains underexplored. Paraphrase robustness is essential for reliable deployment, especially in socially sensitive contexts where inconsistent representations can amplify demographic biases. In this paper, we introduce the Paraphrase Ranking Stability Metric (PRSM), a novel measure for quantifying CLIP's sensitivity to paraphrased queries. Using the Social Counterfactuals dataset, a benchmark designed to reveal social and demographic biases, we empirically assess CLIP's stability under paraphrastic variation, examine the interaction between paraphrase robustness and gender, and discuss implications for fairness and equitable deployment of multimodal systems. Our analysis reveals that robustness varies across paraphrasing strategies, with subtle yet consistent differences observed between male- and female-associated queries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WordNet为名词和动词提供了丰富的超义层次结构，但副词缺乏系统的语义分类，这限制了其在自然语言处理中的应用。

Method: 开发了一个语言学基础的副词超义类型学，包含方式、时间、频率、程度、领域、说话者导向和主语导向等主要语义域，并通过试点标注研究进行实证验证。

Result: 试点标注研究表明，这些类别能够广泛覆盖自然文本中的副词，并且人类标注者能够可靠地分配这些类别。

Conclusion: 该类型学扩展了WordNet的覆盖范围，使其更贴近语言学理论，并促进了词义消歧、事件抽取、情感分析和语篇建模等下游NLP应用。

Abstract: WordNet offers rich supersense hierarchies for nouns and verbs, yet adverbs remain underdeveloped, lacking a systematic semantic classification. We introduce a linguistically grounded supersense typology for adverbs, empirically validated through annotation, that captures major semantic domains including manner, temporal, frequency, degree, domain, speaker-oriented, and subject-oriented functions. Results from a pilot annotation study demonstrate that these categories provide broad coverage of adverbs in natural text and can be reliably assigned by human annotators. Incorporating this typology extends WordNet's coverage, aligns it more closely with linguistic theory, and facilitates downstream NLP applications such as word sense disambiguation, event extraction, sentiment analysis, and discourse modeling. We present the proposed supersense categories, annotation outcomes, and directions for future work.

TL;DR: LANE是一种对抗训练策略，通过选择性标记训练集中的替代词来生成具有挑战性的负例，迫使模型在相同句子中不同标记词之间产生更大的可分性，从而解决神经语言模型在细粒度词义解析中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经语言模型在细粒度词义解析方面存在挑战，因为它们往往过度拟合全局句子表示，无法捕捉局部语义细节。

Method: 提出LANE对抗训练策略，通过选择性标记训练集中的替代词来生成具有挑战性的负训练样本，迫使模型关注目标词并增强相同句子中不同标记词之间的可分性。

Result: 在词汇语义变化检测和词义消歧基准测试中，该方法产生了更具区分性的词表示，性能优于标准对比学习基线。定性分析表明，所提出的负例能够更好地捕捉具有挑战性环境中的细微意义差异。

Conclusion: LANE方法能够生成更具区分性的词表示，提高细粒度词义解析性能，且该方法与模型无关，可以集成到现有的表示学习框架中。

Abstract: Fine-grained word meaning resolution remains a critical challenge for neural language models (NLMs) as they often overfit to global sentence representations, failing to capture local semantic details. We propose a novel adversarial training strategy, called LANE, to address this limitation by deliberately shifting the model's learning focus to the target word. This method generates challenging negative training examples through the selective marking of alternate words in the training set. The goal is to force the model to create a greater separability between same sentences with different marked words. Experimental results on lexical semantic change detection and word sense disambiguation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach yields more discriminative word representations, improving performance over standard contrastive learning baselines. We further provide qualitative analyses showing that the proposed negatives lead to representations that better capture subtle meaning differences even in challenging environments. Our method is model-agnostic and can be integrated into existing representation learning frameworks.

Conclusion: 提出的混合方法成功解决了知识图谱问答生成中的关键挑战，实现了高质量、可扩展的问答生成。

Abstract: The generation of questions and answers (QA) from knowledge graphs (KG) plays a crucial role in the development and testing of educational platforms, dissemination tools, and large language models (LLM). However, existing approaches often struggle with scalability, linguistic quality, and factual consistency. This paper presents a scalable and deterministic pipeline for generating natural language QA from KGs, with an additional refinement step using LLMs to further enhance linguistic quality. The approach first clusters KG triplets based on their relations, creating reusable templates through natural language rules derived from the entity types of objects and relations. A module then leverages LLMs to refine these templates, improving clarity and coherence while preserving factual accuracy. Finally, the instantiation of answer options is achieved through a selection strategy that introduces distractors from the KG. Our experiments demonstrate that this hybrid approach efficiently generates high-quality QA pairs, combining scalability with fluency and linguistic precision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多智能体辩论框架对所有查询都进行辩论，计算成本高且可能降低准确率，需要更智能的选择性触发机制。

Method: 首先让单个智能体生成结构化自我批评响应，提取41个可解释特征，然后使用FocusCal损失训练的轻量级分类器决定是否触发辩论。

Result: 在6个(视觉)问答数据集上，iMAD将token使用量减少高达92%，同时将最终答案准确率提高高达13.5%。

Conclusion: iMAD通过选择性触发多智能体辩论，实现了计算效率和准确性的双重提升，为LLM智能体系统提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agent systems have advanced rapidly, driven by their strong generalization in zero-shot settings. To further enhance reasoning and accuracy on complex tasks, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as a promising framework that engages multiple LLM agents in structured debates to encourage diverse reasoning. However, triggering MAD for every query is inefficient, as it incurs substantial computational (token) cost and may even degrade accuracy by overturning correct single-agent answers. To address these limitations, we propose intelligent Multi-Agent Debate (iMAD), a token-efficient framework that selectively triggers MAD only when it is likely to be beneficial (i.e., correcting an initially wrong answer). To achieve this goal, iMAD learns generalizable model behaviors to make accurate debate decisions. Specifically, iMAD first prompts a single agent to produce a structured self-critique response, from which we extract 41 interpretable linguistic and semantic features capturing hesitation cues. Then, iMAD uses a lightweight debate-decision classifier, trained using our proposed FocusCal loss, to determine whether to trigger MAD, enabling robust debate decisions without test dataset-specific tuning. Through extensive experiments using six (visual) question answering datasets against five competitive baselines, we have shown that iMAD significantly reduces token usage (by up to 92%) while also improving final answer accuracy (by up to 13.5%).

Abstract: Advancements in Machine Learning & Neural Networks in recent years have led to widespread implementations of Natural Language Processing across a variety of fields with remarkable success, solving a wide range of complicated problems. However, recent research has shown that machine learning models may be vulnerable in a number of ways, putting both the models and the systems theyre used in at risk. In this paper, we intend to analyze and experiment with the best of existing adversarial attack recipes and create new ones. We concentrated on developing a novel adversarial attack strategy on current state-of-the-art machine learning models by producing ambiguous inputs for the models to confound them and then constructing the path to the future development of the robustness of the models. We will develop adversarial instances with maximum perplexity, utilizing machine learning and deep learning approaches in order to trick the models. In our attack recipe, we will analyze several datasets and focus on creating obfuscous adversary examples to put the models in a state of perplexity, and by including the Bangla Language in the field of adversarial attacks. We strictly uphold utility usage reduction and efficiency throughout our work.

TL;DR: 提出了LAET方法，通过选择性微调预训练LLM中最有效的层来降低计算成本，在金融NLP任务中表现出色，甚至超越GPT-4等大型模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在金融NLP应用中计算需求高、可访问性受限的问题。

Method: Layer-wise Adaptive Ensemble Tuning (LAET) - 通过分析隐藏状态表示，选择性微调预训练LLM中最有效的层，同时冻结不太关键的层。

Result: 在金融NLP任务中表现出强劲结果，超越现有基准和最先进的LLM（如GPT-4），即使使用较小的LLM（约30亿参数）。

Conclusion: LAET方法在显著降低计算开销的同时提升了任务特定性能，为金融应用提供了高效且可扩展的模型。

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) has transformed the financial industry, enabling advancements in areas such as textual analysis, risk management, and forecasting. Large language models (LLMs) like BloombergGPT and FinMA have set new benchmarks across various financial NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, stock movement prediction, and credit risk assessment. Furthermore, FinMA-ES, a bilingual financial LLM, has also demonstrated strong performance using the FLARE and FLARE-ES benchmarks. However, the high computational demands of these models limit the accessibility of many organizations. To address this, we propose Layer-wise Adaptive Ensemble Tuning (LAET), a novel strategy that selectively fine-tunes the most effective layers of pre-trained LLMs by analyzing hidden state representations while freezing less critical layers. LAET significantly reduces computational overhead while enhancing task-specific performance. Our approach shows strong results in financial NLP tasks, outperforming existing benchmarks and state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4, even with smaller LLMs ($\sim$3B parameters). This work bridges cutting-edge financial NLP research and real-world deployment with efficient and scalable models for financial applications.

Conclusion: NOVA展示了可扩展的发现潜力，能够处理需要多步推理、迭代编码和计算问题解决的数字病理学分析任务。

Abstract: Digitized histopathology analysis involves complex, time-intensive workflows and specialized expertise, limiting its accessibility. We introduce NOVA, an agentic framework that translates scientific queries into executable analysis pipelines by iteratively generating and running Python code. NOVA integrates 49 domain-specific tools (e.g., nuclei segmentation, whole-slide encoding) built on open-source software, and can also create new tools ad hoc. To evaluate such systems, we present SlideQuest, a 90-question benchmark -- verified by pathologists and biomedical scientists -- spanning data processing, quantitative analysis, and hypothesis testing. Unlike prior biomedical benchmarks focused on knowledge recall or diagnostic QA, SlideQuest demands multi-step reasoning, iterative coding, and computational problem solving. Quantitative evaluation shows NOVA outperforms coding-agent baselines, and a pathologist-verified case study links morphology to prognostically relevant PAM50 subtypes, demonstrating its scalable discovery potential.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has not been matched by their evaluation in low-resource languages, especially Southeast Asian languages like Lao. To fill this gap, we introduce LaoBench, the first large-scale, high-quality, and multidimensional benchmark dataset dedicated to assessing LLMs' comprehensive language understanding and reasoning abilities in Lao. LaoBench comprises over 17,000 carefully curated samples spanning three core dimensions: knowledge application, K12 foundational education, and bilingual translation among Lao, Chinese, and English. The dataset is divided into open-source and closed-source subsets, with the closed-source portion enabling black-box evaluation on an official platform to ensure fairness and data security. Our data construction pipeline integrates expert human curation with automated agent-assisted verification, ensuring linguistic accuracy, cultural relevance, and educational value. Benchmarking multiple state-of-the-art LLMs on LaoBench reveals that current models still face significant challenges in mastering Lao across diverse tasks. We hope LaoBench will catalyze further research and development of AI technologies for underrepresented Southeast Asian languages.

Conclusion: 该共享任务为AI生成文本检测提供了重要基准，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: The generation of highly fluent text by Large Language Models (LLMs) poses a significant challenge to information integrity and academic research. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Domain Detection of AI-Generated Text (M-DAIGT) shared task, which focuses on detecting AI-generated text across multiple domains, particularly in news articles and academic writing. M-DAIGT comprises two binary classification subtasks: News Article Detection (NAD) (Subtask 1) and Academic Writing Detection (AWD) (Subtask 2). To support this task, we developed and released a new large-scale benchmark dataset of 30,000 samples, balanced between human-written and AI-generated texts. The AI-generated content was produced using a variety of modern LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) and diverse prompting strategies. A total of 46 unique teams registered for the shared task, of which four teams submitted final results. All four teams participated in both Subtask 1 and Subtask 2. We describe the methods employed by these participating teams and briefly discuss future directions for M-DAIGT.

TL;DR: 语言模型和婴儿都能学习自然语言，但语言模型缺乏人类特有的归纳偏置，导致它们对某些不可能语言的学习表现与人类不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型与人类婴儿在语言学习能力上的差异，特别是对自然语言和不可能语言的学习表现。

Method: 回顾现有文献，分析语言模型对自然语言和不可能语言的学习表现，并与人类婴儿的学习能力进行对比。

Result: 语言模型通常能同等学习自然语言和许多不可能语言，而难以学习的不可能语言通常更复杂或随机。语言模型缺乏支持语言习得的人类归纳偏置。

Conclusion: 语言模型在语言学习能力上与人类婴儿存在根本差异，主要在于缺乏人类特有的归纳偏置机制。

Abstract: According to Futrell and Mahowald [arXiv:2501.17047], both infants and language models (LMs) find attested languages easier to learn than impossible languages that have unnatural structures. We review the literature and show that LMs often learn attested and many impossible languages equally well. Difficult to learn impossible languages are simply more complex (or random). LMs are missing human inductive biases that support language acquisition.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种主动式听觉辅助系统，通过双模型架构实时识别和分离佩戴者的对话伙伴，无需显式提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够主动适应对话动态的听觉辅助设备，利用佩戴者的自我语音作为锚点，在多人对话环境中自动识别对话伙伴并抑制其他声音。

Method: 使用双模型架构：轻量级流式模型每12.5毫秒运行一次实现低延迟提取，较慢模型较少运行以捕捉长距离对话动态。基于自我语音、轮换行为和对话动态推断对话伙伴。

Result: 在真实世界2人和3人对话测试集上（11名参与者，共6.8小时数据）显示系统在多对话环境中能泛化识别和隔离对话伙伴。

Conclusion: 这项工作标志着向能够主动适应对话动态和参与度的听觉辅助设备迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: We introduce proactive hearing assistants that automatically identify and separate the wearer's conversation partners, without requiring explicit prompts. Our system operates on egocentric binaural audio and uses the wearer's self-speech as an anchor, leveraging turn-taking behavior and dialogue dynamics to infer conversational partners and suppress others. To enable real-time, on-device operation, we propose a dual-model architecture: a lightweight streaming model runs every 12.5 ms for low-latency extraction of the conversation partners, while a slower model runs less frequently to capture longer-range conversational dynamics. Results on real-world 2- and 3-speaker conversation test sets, collected with binaural egocentric hardware from 11 participants totaling 6.8 hours, show generalization in identifying and isolating conversational partners in multi-conversation settings. Our work marks a step toward hearing assistants that adapt proactively to conversational dynamics and engagement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: W2S-AlignTree是一个创新的即插即用推理时对齐框架，首次将蒙特卡洛树搜索与弱到强泛化范式结合，无需修改模型参数即可实现细粒度对齐控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM输出常与人类偏好不一致，训练时对齐方法成本高且缺乏动态控制，需要可扩展和适应性强的对齐机制。

Method: 将LLM对齐建模为生成搜索树中的最优启发式搜索问题，利用弱模型的实时步级信号作为对齐代理，引入熵感知探索机制。

Result: 在情感生成、摘要和指令跟随任务中一致优于强基线，将Llama3-8B在摘要任务上的性能从1.89提升到2.19，相对改进15.9%。

Conclusion: W2S-AlignTree为LLM对齐提供了高效、可扩展的推理时解决方案，实现了细粒度控制而无需模型参数修改。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, yet their outputs often suffer from misalignment with human preferences due to the inadequacy of weak supervision and a lack of fine-grained control. Training-time alignment methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) face prohibitive costs in expert supervision and inherent scalability limitations, offering limited dynamic control during inference. Consequently, there is an urgent need for scalable and adaptable alignment mechanisms. To address this, we propose W2S-AlignTree, a pioneering plug-and-play inference-time alignment framework that synergistically combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with the Weak-to-Strong Generalization paradigm for the first time. W2S-AlignTree formulates LLM alignment as an optimal heuristic search problem within a generative search tree. By leveraging weak model's real-time, step-level signals as alignment proxies and introducing an Entropy-Aware exploration mechanism, W2S-AlignTree enables fine-grained guidance during strong model's generation without modifying its parameters. The approach dynamically balances exploration and exploitation in high-dimensional generation search trees. Experiments across controlled sentiment generation, summarization, and instruction-following show that W2S-AlignTree consistently outperforms strong baselines. Notably, W2S-AlignTree raises the performance of Llama3-8B from 1.89 to 2.19, a relative improvement of 15.9 on the summarization task.

Motivation: 现有的学术基准测试对现实世界专业环境中的表现评估有限，特别是在法律和金融等高风险领域，无法充分评估开放式、具有经济影响的任务。

Method: 招募182名持有JD、CFA证书或6年以上经验的专业人士，基于实际工作流程编写任务，并通过独立专家验证的质量管道验证专家制定的评分标准。

Result: 评估20个领先模型显示有显著改进空间，金融和法律困难子集的最高得分仅为0.39和0.37。模型在特定能力上表现差异很大，常见失败模式包括判断不准确、缺乏过程透明度和推理不完整。

Conclusion: 当前模型在专业采用可靠性方面存在关键差距，需要改进判断准确性、过程透明度和推理完整性，才能在实际专业环境中可靠使用。

Abstract: Frontier model progress is often measured by academic benchmarks, which offer a limited view of performance in real-world professional contexts. Existing evaluations often fail to assess open-ended, economically consequential tasks in high-stakes domains like Legal and Finance, where practical returns are paramount. To address this, we introduce Professional Reasoning Bench (PRBench), a realistic, open-ended, and difficult benchmark of real-world problems in Finance and Law. We open-source its 1,100 expert-authored tasks and 19,356 expert-curated criteria, making it, to our knowledge, the largest public, rubric-based benchmark for both legal and finance domains. We recruit 182 qualified professionals, holding JDs, CFAs, or 6+ years of experience, who contributed tasks inspired by their actual workflows. This process yields significant diversity, with tasks spanning 114 countries and 47 US jurisdictions. Our expert-curated rubrics are validated through a rigorous quality pipeline, including independent expert validation. Subsequent evaluation of 20 leading models reveals substantial room for improvement, with top scores of only 0.39 (Finance) and 0.37 (Legal) on our Hard subsets. We further catalog associated economic impacts of the prompts and analyze performance using human-annotated rubric categories. Our analysis shows that models with similar overall scores can diverge significantly on specific capabilities. Common failure modes include inaccurate judgments, a lack of process transparency and incomplete reasoning, highlighting critical gaps in their reliability for professional adoption.

Motivation: 传统基于ID的推荐系统面临冷启动和泛化挑战，现有工业多模态推荐采用两阶段训练导致目标不一致和无法动态适应新数据的问题。

Method: 提出LEMUR系统，采用端到端训练方式联合优化多模态和推荐组件；引入新颖的记忆库机制增量累积历史多模态表示以降低计算成本。

Result: 在抖音搜索部署一个月后，查询变化率衰减降低0.843%，QAUC提升0.81%；在抖音广告中多个离线指标均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 结果验证了端到端多模态推荐在真实工业场景中的优越性。

Abstract: Traditional ID-based recommender systems often struggle with cold-start and generalization challenges. Multimodal recommendation systems, which leverage textual and visual data, offer a promising solution to mitigate these issues. However, existing industrial approaches typically adopt a two-stage training paradigm: first pretraining a multimodal model, then applying its frozen representations to train the recommendation model. This decoupled framework suffers from misalignment between multimodal learning and recommendation objectives, as well as an inability to adapt dynamically to new data. To address these limitations, we propose LEMUR, the first large-scale multimodal recommender system trained end-to-end from raw data. By jointly optimizing both the multimodal and recommendation components, LEMUR ensures tighter alignment with downstream objectives while enabling real-time parameter updates. Constructing multimodal sequential representations from user history often entails prohibitively high computational costs. To alleviate this bottleneck, we propose a novel memory bank mechanism that incrementally accumulates historical multimodal representations throughout the training process. After one month of deployment in Douyin Search, LEMUR has led to a 0.843% reduction in query change rate decay and a 0.81% improvement in QAUC. Additionally, LEMUR has shown significant gains across key offline metrics for Douyin Advertisement. Our results validate the superiority of end-to-end multimodal recommendation in real-world industrial scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的网页档案保存了大量政府PDF文档，但访问和发现能力有限，仅支持下载单个PDF和基本关键词搜索。

Method: 开发了包含搜索功能、嵌入管道、系统架构和开源代码库的完整系统，支持四种主要搜索方式：元数据过滤、精确文本搜索、语义文本搜索和视觉搜索。

Result: 成功处理了10,015,993份联邦政府PDF文档（总计70,958,487页），总计算成本约1500美元，相当于每美元处理47,000页PDF。

Conclusion: GovScape展示了在1000万PDF规模上实现多模态搜索的可行性，并已开始向1亿+PDF规模扩展。

Abstract: Efforts over the past three decades have produced web archives containing billions of webpage snapshots and petabytes of data. The End of Term Web Archive alone contains, among other file types, millions of PDFs produced by the federal government. While preservation with web archives has been successful, significant challenges for access and discoverability remain. For example, current affordances for browsing the End of Term PDFs are limited to downloading and browsing individual PDFs, as well as performing basic keyword search across them. In this paper, we introduce GovScape, a public search system that supports multimodal searches across 10,015,993 federal government PDFs from the 2020 End of Term crawl (70,958,487 total PDF pages) - to our knowledge, all renderable PDFs in the 2020 crawl that are 50 pages or under. GovScape supports four primary forms of search over these 10 million PDFs: in addition to providing (1) filter conditions over metadata facets including domain and crawl date and (2) exact text search against the PDF text, we provide (3) semantic text search and (4) visual search against the PDFs across individual pages, enabling users to structure queries such as "redacted documents" or "pie charts." We detail the constituent components of GovScape, including the search affordances, embedding pipeline, system architecture, and open source codebase. Significantly, the total estimated compute cost for GovScape's pre-processing pipeline for 10 million PDFs was approximately $1,500, equivalent to 47,000 PDF pages per dollar spent on compute, demonstrating the potential for immediate scalability. Accordingly, we outline steps that we have already begun pursuing toward multimodal search at the 100+ million PDF scale. GovScape can be found at https://www.govscape.net.

TL;DR: 提出基于软插补SVD的群组推荐系统，通过低秩矩阵补全处理稀疏高维数据，在小群组中表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 群组活动日益流行，需要基于群组成员集体偏好提供推荐。现有群组推荐系统常因数据稀疏性和高维性而表现不佳。

Method: 使用软插补奇异值分解(SVD)进行低秩矩阵补全，开发Group Soft-Impute SVD群组推荐系统。

Result: 在Goodbooks、Movielens和合成数据集上，该方法在小群组中的召回率优于基于群组矩阵分解的基线方法，在所有群组规模下均获得可比结果，且能恢复更低的矩阵秩。

Conclusion: Group Soft-Impute SVD能有效处理高维稀疏数据，在群组推荐任务中表现良好。

Abstract: The growing popularity of group activities increased the need to develop methods for providing recommendations to a group of users based on the collective preferences of the group members. Several group recommender systems have been proposed, but these methods often struggle due to sparsity and high-dimensionality of the available data, common in many real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a group recommender system called Group Soft-Impute SVD, which leverages soft-impute singular value decomposition to enhance group recommendations. This approach addresses the challenge of sparse high-dimensional data using low-rank matrix completion. We compared the performance of Group Soft-Impute SVD with Group MF based approaches and found that our method outperforms the baselines in recall for small user groups while achieving comparable results across all group sizes when tasked on Goodbooks, Movielens, and Synthetic datasets. Furthermore, our method recovers lower matrix ranks than the baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant advantages in leveraging structured world knowledge and multi-step reasoning capabilities. However, fundamental challenges arise when transforming LLMs into real-world recommender systems due to semantic and behavioral misalignment. To bridge this gap, we propose Align$^3$GR, a novel framework that unifies token-level, behavior modeling-level, and preference-level alignment. Our approach introduces: Dual tokenization fusing user-item semantic and collaborative signals. Enhanced behavior modeling with bidirectional semantic alignment. Progressive DPO strategy combining self-play (SP-DPO) and real-world feedback (RF-DPO) for dynamic preference adaptation. Experiments show Align$^3$GR outperforms the SOTA baseline by +17.8% in Recall@10 and +20.2% in NDCG@10 on the public dataset, with significant gains in online A/B tests and full-scale deployment on an industrial large-scale recommendation platform.

Abstract: We introduce MOON, our comprehensive set of sustainable iterative practices for multimodal representation learning for e-commerce applications. MOON has already been fully deployed across all stages of Taobao search advertising system, including retrieval, relevance, ranking, and so on. The performance gains are particularly significant on click-through rate (CTR) prediction task, which achieves an overall +20.00% online CTR improvement. Over the past three years, this project has delivered the largest improvement on CTR prediction task and undergone five full-scale iterations. Throughout the exploration and iteration of our MOON, we have accumulated valuable insights and practical experience that we believe will benefit the research community. MOON contains a three-stage training paradigm of "Pretraining, Post-training, and Application", allowing effective integration of multimodal representations with downstream tasks. Notably, to bridge the misalignment between the objectives of multimodal representation learning and downstream training, we define the exchange rate to quantify how effectively improvements in an intermediate metric can translate into downstream gains. Through this analysis, we identify the image-based search recall as a critical intermediate metric guiding the optimization of multimodal models. Over three years and five iterations, MOON has evolved along four critical dimensions: data processing, training strategy, model architecture, and downstream application. The lessons and insights gained through the iterative improvements will also be shared. As part of our exploration into scaling effects in the e-commerce field, we further conduct a systematic study of the scaling laws governing multimodal representation learning, examining multiple factors such as the number of training tokens, negative samples, and the length of user behavior sequences.

### [194] [SRLF: An Agent-Driven Set-Wise Reflective Learning Framework for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11370)
*Jiahao Wang,Bokang Fu,Yu Zhu,Yuli Liu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了基于集合的反思学习框架（SRLF），通过评估-验证-反思的闭环循环，利用LLM的上下文学习能力对整组物品进行整体判断，解决了传统点式方法在用户偏好理解和物品语义表示方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM代理研究主要关注对单个物品的用户评分建模，这种点式方法导致用户偏好理解不准确和物品语义表示僵化的问题，限制了推荐系统的效果。

Method: SRLF框架采用集合层面的整体判断方法，综合分析集合内物品间的复杂相互关系及其与用户偏好配置的集体一致性，通过评估-验证-反思的闭环循环实现。

Result: 大量实验验证了该方法的有效性，证实集合视角对于在序列推荐任务中实现最先进性能至关重要。

Conclusion: 集合式反思学习框架通过整组物品的上下文理解，能够捕捉用户行为中的复杂关系模式，显著提升了序列推荐的性能。

Abstract: LLM-based agents are emerging as a promising paradigm for simulating user behavior to enhance recommender systems. However, their effectiveness is often limited by existing studies that focus on modeling user ratings for individual items. This point-wise approach leads to prevalent issues such as inaccurate user preference comprehension and rigid item-semantic representations.
  To address these limitations, we propose the novel Set-wise Reflective Learning Framework (SRLF). Our framework operationalizes a closed-loop "assess-validate-reflect" cycle that harnesses the powerful in-context learning capabilities of LLMs. SRLF departs from conventional point-wise assessment by formulating a holistic judgment on an entire set of items. It accomplishes this by comprehensively analyzing both the intricate interrelationships among items within the set and their collective alignment with the user's preference profile. This method of set-level contextual understanding allows our model to capture complex relational patterns essential to user behavior, making it significantly more adept for sequential recommendation. Extensive experiments validate our approach, confirming that this set-wise perspective is crucial for achieving state-of-the-art performance in sequential recommendation tasks.

*Sherry Shi,Renyao Wei,Michele Tufano,José Cambronero,Runxiang Cheng,Franjo Ivančić,Pat Rondon*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM的人类参与式补丁有效性评估方法，通过生成评估标准、人工审核和LLM判断来降低手动标注成本，在Google sanitizer工具发现的bug补丁上取得了良好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动化程序修复(APR)评估主要依赖基于执行的测试方法，无法准确捕捉补丁的真实有效性，而手动标注成本高昂。

Method: 采用人类参与循环方法：首先用LLM生成每个bug的评估标准，然后进行一次性人工审核和可选精炼，最后用LLM基于精炼后的标准判断补丁有效性。

Result: 在人类评分者一致同意的补丁上，与人类共识达成显著一致(Cohen's kappa 0.75)，召回率0.94，精确率0.80；在全数据集上Cohen's kappa 0.57，召回率0.93，精确率0.65。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效降低手动标注成本，在补丁有效性评估方面表现良好，但仍需进一步改进以处理人类评分者存在分歧的情况。

Abstract: Reliable evaluation is crucial for advancing Automated Program Repair (APR), but prevailing benchmarks rely on execution-based evaluation methods (unit test pass@k), which fail to capture true patch validity. Determining validity can require costly manual annotation. To reduce this cost, we introduce a human-in-the-loop approach to LLM-based patch validity judgment. Inspired by the observation that human judgment is better aligned when using a shared rubric, we first employ an LLM to generate a per-bug rubric, followed by a one-time human review and optional refinement to this rubric, and then employ an LLM to judge patches using the refined rubric. We apply this approach to assign binary validity labels to patches for issues found by Google sanitizer tools. Our results show that this approach yields substantial agreement with human consensus (Cohen's kappa 0.75), high recall (0.94) and high precision (0.80), when considering patches that have unanimous agreement from 3 human raters on the validity labels. On the full dataset including patches where human raters disagree, we find this approach can still be further improved (Cohen's kappa 0.57, recall 0.93, precision 0.65) and identify possible future directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代计算机系统复杂性增加，设计时验证无法完全保证运行时行为，存在未知的控制流异常风险。

Method: 提出结合LLM和一致性检查的方法论，利用LLM连接设计时模型和实现代码，自动化源代码插桩，通过一致性检查分析事件日志。

Result: 在ERTMS/ETCS铁路系统案例中，LLM源代码插桩达到84.775%控制流覆盖率，异常检测达到96.610% F1分数和93.515% AUC。

Conclusion: 结合领域知识指导LLM进行源代码插桩能够获得可靠的高质量软件日志，通过一致性检查实现有效的控制流异常检测。

Abstract: Context: Ensuring high levels of dependability in modern computer-based systems has become increasingly challenging due to their complexity. Although systems are validated at design time, their behavior can be different at run-time, possibly showing control-flow anomalies due to "unknown unknowns".
  Objective: We aim to detect control-flow anomalies through software monitoring, which verifies run-time behavior by logging software execution and detecting deviations from expected control flow.
  Methods: We propose a methodology to develop software monitors for control-flow anomaly detection through Large Language Models (LLMs) and conformance checking. The methodology builds on existing software development practices to maintain traditional V&V while providing an additional level of robustness and trustworthiness. It leverages LLMs to link design-time models and implementation code, automating source-code instrumentation. The resulting event logs are analyzed via conformance checking, an explainable and effective technique for control-flow anomaly detection.
  Results: We test the methodology on a case-study scenario from the European Railway Traffic Management System / European Train Control System (ERTMS/ETCS), which is a railway standard for modern interoperable railways. The results obtained from the ERTMS/ETCS case study demonstrate that LLM-based source-code instrumentation can achieve up to 84.775% control-flow coverage of the reference design-time process model, while the subsequent conformance checking-based anomaly detection reaches a peak performance of 96.610% F1-score and 93.515% AUC.
  Conclusion: Incorporating domain-specific knowledge to guide LLMs in source-code instrumentation significantly allowed obtaining reliable and quality software logs and enabled effective control-flow anomaly detection through conformance checking.

*Noor Nashid,Daniel Ding,Keheliya Gallaba,Ahmed E. Hassan,Ali Mesbah*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本研究系统评估了四种LLM驱动的编程代理在修复多块缺陷方面的表现，发现修复准确率从25.8%到93.3%不等，且性能随缺陷分散度和复杂度增加而下降。高表现代理具有更好的语义一致性，而低表现代理常引入新测试失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统程序修复主要关注单块缺陷，忽视了现实系统中普遍存在的多块缺陷。修复这些缺陷需要在多个不相交代码区域进行协调编辑，挑战性更大。

Method: 在Hunk4J数据集的372个多块缺陷上评估四种LLM编程代理，使用细粒度指标分析1,488个修复轨迹，包括定位、修复准确性、回归行为和操作动态。开发Maple工具为代理提供仓库级上下文。

Result: 修复准确率范围：25.8%(Qwen Code)到93.3%(Claude Code)；高表现代理实现正向回归减少，低表现代理常引入新测试失败；失败修复消耗更多资源(39%-343%更多token)和更长时间(43%-427%)；Maple将Gemini-cli修复准确率提升30%。

Conclusion: 通过细粒度指标和轨迹级分析，本研究不仅关注准确性，还解释了编程代理在多块修复过程中的定位、推理和行动方式，为理解LLM代理在复杂修复任务中的行为提供了系统见解。

Abstract: Automated program repair has traditionally focused on single-hunk defects, overlooking multi-hunk bugs that are prevalent in real-world systems. Repairing these bugs requires coordinated edits across multiple, disjoint code regions, posing substantially greater challenges. We present the first systematic study of LLM-driven coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini-cli, and Qwen Code) on this task. We evaluate these agents on 372 multi-hunk bugs from the Hunk4J dataset, analyzing 1,488 repair trajectories using fine-grained metrics that capture localization, repair accuracy, regression behavior, and operational dynamics. Results reveal substantial variation: repair accuracy ranges from 25.8% (Qwen Code) to 93.3% (Claude Code) and consistently declines with increasing bug dispersion and complexity. High-performing agents demonstrate superior semantic consistency, achieving positive regression reduction, whereas lower-performing agents often introduce new test failures. Notably, agents do not fail fast; failed repairs consume substantially more resources (39%-343% more tokens) and require longer execution time (43%-427%). Additionally, we developed Maple to provide agents with repository-level context. Empirical results show that Maple improves the repair accuracy of Gemini-cli by 30% through enhanced localization. By analyzing fine-grained metrics and trajectory-level analysis, this study moves beyond accuracy to explain how coding agents localize, reason, and act during multi-hunk repair.

Motivation: 现有LLM研究主要关注通用编程语言，而工业过程自动化领域的专业语言支持不足，企业需要在不投入大量训练成本的情况下利用LLM。

Method: 采用少量样本提示方法，在不需要专门训练领域特定语言模型的情况下，测试LLM处理专业编程语言的能力。

Result: 研究表明少量样本提示方法足以让LLM解决工业过程自动化领域的简单编程问题，且可在本地部署确保数据安全。

Conclusion: 企业可以通过少量样本提示方法在本地部署LLM来处理专业编程语言问题，无需投入大量训练成本，同时保护敏感数据。

Abstract: How to best use Large Language Models (LLMs) for software engineering is covered in many publications in recent years. However, most of this work focuses on widely-used general purpose programming languages. The utility of LLMs for software within the industrial process automation domain, with highly-specialized languages that are typically only used in proprietary contexts, is still underexplored. Within this paper, we study enterprises can achieve on their own without investing large amounts of effort into the training of models specific to the domain-specific languages that are used. We show that few-shot prompting approaches are sufficient to solve simple problems in a language that is otherwise not well-supported by an LLM and that is possible on-premise, thereby ensuring the protection of sensitive company data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有软件质量研究数据集往往只关注有限维度（如代码异味、技术债务或重构活动），限制了跨时间和质量维度的综合分析。

Method: 通过集成9种最先进的静态分析工具（SonarQube、CodeScene、PMD等），从450个成熟开源项目中提取多维度质量指标，涵盖方法、类、文件和项目级别。

Result: 构建了包含63,586个分析项目版本的SQuaD数据集，提供版本控制历史、问题跟踪历史、软件漏洞数据（CVE/CWE）以及过程指标。

Conclusion: SQuaD支持可维护性、技术债务、软件演化和质量评估的实证研究，并提出了自动化数据集更新和跨项目质量建模等新兴研究方向。

Abstract: Software quality research increasingly relies on large-scale datasets that measure both the product and process aspects of software systems. However, existing resources often focus on limited dimensions, such as code smells, technical debt, or refactoring activity, thereby restricting comprehensive analyses across time and quality dimensions. To address this gap, we present the Software Quality Dataset (SQuaD), a multi-dimensional, time-aware collection of software quality metrics extracted from 450 mature open-source projects across diverse ecosystems, including Apache, Mozilla, FFmpeg, and the Linux kernel. By integrating nine state-of-the-art static analysis tools, i.e., SonarQube, CodeScene, PMD, Understand, CK, JaSoMe, RefactoringMiner, RefactoringMiner++, and PyRef, our dataset unifies over 700 unique metrics at method, class, file, and project levels. Covering a total of 63,586 analyzed project releases, SQuaD also provides version control and issue-tracking histories, software vulnerability data (CVE/CWE), and process metrics proven to enhance Just-In-Time (JIT) defect prediction. The SQuaD enables empirical research on maintainability, technical debt, software evolution, and quality assessment at unprecedented scale. We also outline emerging research directions, including automated dataset updates and cross-project quality modeling to support the continuous evolution of software analytics. The dataset is publicly available on ZENODO (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17566690).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能合约可重用组件(SCRs)在加速业务特定合约开发中发挥重要作用，但逻辑级使用违规风险日益严重。这种违规发生在SCR遵循使用规则但与当前业务逻辑不匹配时，导致严重漏洞，需要深度语义理解来检测。

Result: 在3个真实数据集上的评估显示，SCRUTINEER在检测SCRs逻辑级使用违规方面达到80.77%的精确率、82.35%的召回率和81.55%的F1分数。

Conclusion: SCRUTINEER是首个自动化实用的SCR逻辑级使用违规检测系统，能够有效识别智能合约中与业务逻辑不匹配的潜在漏洞，为智能合约安全提供重要保障。

Abstract: Smart Contract Reusable Components(SCRs) play a vital role in accelerating the development of business-specific contracts by promoting modularity and code reuse. However, the risks associated with SCR usage violations have become a growing concern. One particular type of SCR usage violation, known as a logic-level usage violation, is becoming especially harmful. This violation occurs when the SCR adheres to its specified usage rules but fails to align with the specific business logic of the current context, leading to significant vulnerabilities. Detecting such violations necessitates a deep semantic understanding of the contract's business logic, including the ability to extract implicit usage patterns and analyze fine-grained logical behaviors. To address these challenges, we propose SCRUTINEER, the first automated and practical system for detecting logic-level usage violations of SCRs. First, we design a composite feature extraction approach that produces three complementary feature representations, supporting subsequent analysis. We then introduce a Large Language Model-powered knowledge construction framework, which leverages comprehension-oriented prompts and domain-specific tools to extract logic-level usage and build the SCR knowledge base. Next, we develop a Retrieval-Augmented Generation-driven inspector, which combines a rapid retrieval strategy with both comprehensive and targeted analysis to identify potentially insecure logic-level usages. Finally, we implement a logic-level usage violation analysis engine that integrates a similarity-based checker and a snapshot-based inference conflict checker to enable accurate and robust detection. We evaluate SCRUTINEER from multiple perspectives on 3 ground-truth datasets. The results show that SCRUTINEER achieves a precision of 80.77%, a recall of 82.35%, and an F1-score of 81.55% in detecting logic-level usage violations of SCRs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 敏捷方法在灵活性方面具有优势，但难以直接应用于航空航天等安全关键系统的开发，因为需要满足DO-178C等严格认证标准，强调文档化、需求追踪和验证验证活动。

Method: 开发CertiA360工具，通过与行业专家合作设计和验证，自动化管理变更请求和需求追踪，提高需求成熟度，并与监管目标保持一致。

Result: 反馈显示CertiA360的自动化可以减少人工工作量，同时响应需求变更并确保DO-178C合规性。虽然工具尚未通过DO-330认证，但结果表明适当定制的敏捷方法可以与安全系统开发要求共存并提高效率。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过适当定制，敏捷方法不仅可以在航空航天等高度监管领域与安全系统开发和认证要求共存，还能增加效率。CertiA360工具展示了这种集成的可行性。

Abstract: Agile methods are characterised by iterative and incremental processes with a strong focus on flexibility and accommodating changing requirements based on either technical, regulatory, or stakeholder feedback. However, integrating Agile methods into safety-critical system development in the aerospace industry presents substantial challenges due to its strict compliance requirements, such as those outlined in the DO-178C standard. To achieve this vision, the flexibility of Agile must align with the rigorous certification guidelines, which emphasize documentation, traceability of requirements across different levels and disciplines, and comprehensive verification and validation (V&V) activities. The research work described in this paper proposes a way of using the strengths of the flexible nature of Agile methods to automate and manage change requests throughout the whole software development lifecycle, ensuring robust traceability, regulatory compliance and ultimately facilitating successful certification. This study proposes CertiA360, a tool designed to help teams improve requirement maturity, automate the changes in traceability, and align with the regulatory objectives. The tool was designed and validated in close collaboration with aerospace industry experts, using their feedback to ensure practical application and real-life effectiveness. The feedback collected demonstrated that the automation given by CertiA360 may reduce manual effort and allow response to changing requirements while ensuring compliance with DO-178C. While the tool is not yet qualified under DO-330 (Tool Qualification), findings suggest that when tailored appropriately, Agile methods can not only coexist with the requirements of safety-system development and certification in highly regulated domains like aerospace, but also add efficiency.

Abstract: Benchmarking is essential for developing and evaluating black-box optimization algorithms, providing a structured means to analyze their search behavior. Its effectiveness relies on carefully selected problem sets used for evaluation. To date, most established benchmark suites for black-box optimization consist of abstract or synthetic problems that only partially capture the complexities of real-world engineering applications, thereby severely limiting the insights that can be gained for application-oriented optimization scenarios and reducing their practical impact. To close this gap, we propose a new benchmarking suite that addresses it by presenting a curated set of optimization benchmarks rooted in structural mechanics. The current implemented benchmarks are derived from vehicle crashworthiness scenarios, which inherently require the use of gradient-free algorithms due to the non-smooth, highly non-linear nature of the underlying models. Within this paper, the reader will find descriptions of the physical context of each case, the corresponding optimization problem formulations, and clear guidelines on how to employ the suite.

Conclusion: 成功将椭圆势引理扩展到竞争性多智能体环境，为广义需求模型下的价格竞争提供了有效的去中心化解决方案。

Abstract: We study sequential price competition among $N$ sellers, each influenced by the pricing decisions of their rivals. Specifically, the demand function for each seller $i$ follows the single index model $λ_i(\mathbf{p}) = μ_i(\langle \boldsymbolθ_{i,0}, \mathbf{p} \rangle)$, with known increasing link $μ_i$ and unknown parameter $\boldsymbolθ_{i,0}$, where the vector $\mathbf{p}$ denotes the vector of prices offered by all the sellers simultaneously at a given instant. Each seller observes only their own realized demand -- unobservable to competitors -- and the prices set by rivals. Our framework generalizes existing approaches that focus solely on linear demand models. We propose a novel decentralized policy, PML-GLUCB, that combines penalized MLE with an upper-confidence pricing rule, removing the need for coordinated exploration phases across sellers -- which is integral to previous linear models -- and accommodating both binary and real-valued demand observations. Relative to a dynamic benchmark policy, each seller achieves $O(N^{2}\sqrt{T}\log(T))$ regret, which essentially matches the optimal rate known in the linear setting. A significant technical contribution of our work is the development of a variant of the elliptical potential lemma -- typically applied in single-agent systems -- adapted to our competitive multi-agent environment.

Conclusion: 分散决策的网络在战略环境中具有出人意料的鲁棒性，攻击者的目标函数选择对实际损害有重要影响。

Abstract: Communication networks are essential for our economy and our everyday lives. This makes them lucrative targets for attacks. Today, we see an ongoing battle between criminals that try to disrupt our key communication networks and security professionals that try to mitigate these attacks. However, today's networks, like the Internet or peer-to-peer networks among smart devices, are not controlled by a single authority, but instead consist of many independently administrated entities that are interconnected. Thus, both the decisions of how to interconnect and how to secure against potential attacks are taken in a decentralized way by selfish agents.
  This strategic setting, with agents that want to interconnect and potential attackers that want to disrupt the network, was captured via an influential game-theoretic model by Goyal, Jabbari, Kearns, Khanna, and Morgenstern (WINE 2016). We revisit this model and show improved tight bounds on the achieved robustness of networks created by selfish agents. As our main result, we show that such networks can resist attacks of a large class of potential attackers, i.e., these networks maintain asymptotically optimal welfare post attack. This improves several bounds and resolves an open problem. Along the way, we show the counter-intuitive result, that attackers that aim at minimizing the social welfare post attack do not actually inflict the greatest possible damage.

TL;DR: 比较两种电力定价机制：随时峰值定价(AP)和同时峰值定价(CP)，分析它们在完全信息和不完全信息下的均衡峰值需求表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着电力消费增长，降低峰值需求对防止电网过载和停电至关重要。不同定价机制在实践中被采用，但它们的相对性能尚不明确。

Method: 将电力市场建模为策略博弈，分析AP和CP机制下的均衡峰值需求，考虑完全信息和不完全信息两种情况。

Result: 完全信息下，CP的均衡峰值需求从不高于AP；但不完全信息下，CP的协调机制可能适得其反，导致比AP更大的均衡峰值。

Conclusion: CP机制耦合用户成本的好处必须与协调失败风险权衡，渐进式需求成本结构可能缓解这些风险并保持协调优势。

Abstract: As electricity consumption grows, reducing peak demand--the maximum load on the grid--has become critical for preventing infrastructure strain and blackouts. Pricing mechanisms that incentivize consumers with flexible loads to shift consumption away from high-demand periods have emerged as effective tools, yet different mechanisms are used in practice with unclear relative performance. This work compares two widely implemented approaches: anytime peak pricing (AP), where consumers pay for their individual maximum consumption, and coincident peak pricing (CP), where consumers pay for their consumption during the system-wide peak period. To compare these mechanisms, we model the electricity market as a strategic game and characterize the peak demand in equilibrium under both AP and CP. Our main result demonstrates that with perfect information, equilibrium peak demand under CP never exceeds that under AP; on the other hand, with imperfect information, the coordination introduced by CP can backfire and induce larger equilibrium peaks than AP. These findings demonstrate that potential gains from coupling users' costs (as done in CP) must be weighed against these miscoordination risks. We conclude with preliminary results indicating that progressive demand cost structures--rather than per-unit charges--may mitigate these risks while preserving coordination benefits, achieving desirable performance in both deterministic and stochastic settings.

*Yaoxin Ge,Yao Zhang,Dengji Zhao*

TL;DR: 本文针对在线合作游戏中的早期到达激励问题，提出了新的公平性定义和解决方案，旨在最小化每个到达顺序中价值分配与Shapley值之间的距离。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的在线合作游戏解决方案忽略了单个到达顺序中的公平性，导致重要玩家可能得不到任何价值分配，这在现实中显得不公平。

Method: 提出了平等价值共享机制，通过计算每个到达顺序中价值分配与Shapley值之间的距离，并最小化该距离来实现更公平的分配。

Result: 提出的EVS机制能够最小化价值分配与Shapley值之间的距离，并最大化所有做出贡献的玩家的平等福利。

Conclusion: 新机制在0-1价值游戏中实现了更公平的价值分配，解决了早期解决方案中的公平性问题。

Abstract: Incentives for early arrival (I4EA) was recently proposed for studying online cooperative games. In an online cooperative game, players arrive in an unknown order, and the value increase after each player arrived should be distributed immediately among all the arrived players. Although there is only one arriving order in the game, we also hope that the value distribution is equal to their Shapley value in expectation. To achieve these goals, the early solutions ignored the fairness in each single arriving order. More specifically, an important player may receive nothing in a game, which seems unfair in reality. To combat this, we propose refined fairness in this paper and design new solutions in 0-1 value games. Specifically, we compute the distance of the distribution in each order to the Shapley value and aim to minimize it. We propose a new mechanism called Egalitarian Value-Sharing (EVS) to do so. We also show that the mechanism can maximize the egalitarian welfare among all the players who made contributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部分可观测随机博弈由于缺乏与完全可观测随机博弈动态规划技术的理论连接，现有方法缺乏无损约简，限制了算法的通用性。

Result: 在多个基准领域产生ε最优策略，性能一致匹配或优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 为从随机博弈到部分可观测环境的算法和理论转移开辟了系统化途径。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for ε-optimally solving two-player zero-sum partially observable stochastic games (zs-POSGs). These games pose a major challenge due to the absence of a principled connection with dynamic programming (DP) techniques developed for two-player zero-sum stochastic games (zs-SGs). Prior attempts at transferring solution methods have lacked a lossless reduction, defined here as a transformation that preserves value functions, equilibrium strategies, and optimality structure, thereby limiting generalisation to ad-hoc algorithms. This work introduces the first lossless reduction from zs-POSGs to transition-independent zs-SGs, enabling the principled application of a broad class of DP-based methods. We show empirically that point-based value iteration (PBVI) algorithms, applied via this reduction, produce ε-optimal strategies across a range of benchmark domains, consistently matching or outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. Our results open a systematic pathway for algorithmic and theoretical transfer from SGs to partially observable settings.

Conclusion: 政党对齐单峰偏好为分析政党战略提名提供了有效的理论框架，在三党选举中能保证纯策略纳什均衡的存在，相关决策问题可在多项式时间内解决。

Abstract: We study strategic candidate nomination by parties in elections decided by Plurality voting. Each party selects a nominee before the election, and the winner is chosen from the nominated candidates based on the voters' preferences. We introduce a new restriction on these preferences, which we call party-aligned single-peakedness: all voters agree on a common ordering of the parties along an ideological axis, but may differ in their perceptions of the positions of individual candidates within each party. The preferences of each voter are single-peaked with respect to their own axis over the candidates, which is consistent with the global ordering of the parties. We present a polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing whether a preference profile satisfies party-aligned single-peakedness. In this domain, we give polynomial-time algorithms for deciding whether a given party can become the winner under some (or all) nominations, and whether this can occur in some pure Nash equilibrium. We also prove a tight result about the guaranteed existence of pure strategy Nash equilibria for elections with up to three parties for single-peaked and party-aligned single-peaked preference profiles.

Motivation: 研究happy nucleolus的计算方法，理解其与经典核仁的关系，解决线性规划中的子空间避免约束问题，并在实际应用中验证方法的有效性。

Method: 使用MPS方案计算(happy)核仁，研究线性规划中的分离问题，提出处理子空间避免约束的ε近似方法，并为车辆路径游戏设计高效启发式算法。

Result: 发现happy nucleolus与核仁的关系复杂，玩家在happy nucleolus中的分配可能大于在核仁中的分配，反驳了Meir等人的猜想。提出了处理子空间避免约束的近似方法，并在车辆路径游戏中验证了启发式算法的有效性。

Conclusion: happy nucleolus是一个复杂但有用的公平分配概念，其计算可以通过近似方法有效处理子空间避免约束，在实际应用中表现出良好性能。

Abstract: We study the recently introduced fair division concept of the happy nucleolus for cost allocation among players in a cooperative game, with special focus on its computation. The happy nucleolus applies the same fairness criterion as the well-established nucleolus but with reduced total value. Still, we show that the relation between the two concepts is quite involved, and intuitive properties do not hold - e.g., the entry of a player in the happy nucleolus can be larger than the entry of the same player in the nucleolus, even for monotone and subadditive games. This refutes conjectures of Meir, Rosenschein and Malizia (2011).
  Further, we study the separation problem of the linear programs appearing in the MPS scheme for computing the (happy) nucleolus. It includes linear subspace avoidance constraints, which can be handled efficiently for problems with a certain dynamic programming formulation due to Köhnemann and Toth (2020). We show how to get rid of these constraints for all monotone games if we allow for an arbitrarily small error of epsilon, thus conserving known approximation guarantees for the same problem without subspace avoidance.
  Finally, we focus on practical results at the example of vehicle routing games by designing an efficient heuristic based on our previous insights and past work, and demonstrate its power.

Motivation: 研究在定向网络环境下，当公共物品不可分割且共享容量受限时，玩家如何做出购买和共享决策，以及这种决策对均衡状态的影响。

Method: 建立基于定向图的公共物品博弈模型，玩家决定是否购买物品并选择k个出邻居共享，分析纯策略和混合策略纳什均衡的性质。

Result: 对共享容量k和网络结构进行了全面研究，为均衡的存在性、计算复杂性和效率建立了尖锐的复杂性二分法。

Conclusion: 该模型揭示了在容量受限的定向网络中公共物品博弈的均衡特性，为理解此类博弈的计算和效率维度提供了理论框架。

Abstract: In a public goods game, every player chooses whether or not to buy a good that all neighboring players will have access to. We consider a setting in which the good is indivisible, neighboring players are out-neighbors in a directed graph, and there is a capacity constraint on their number, k, that can benefit from the good. This means that each player makes a two-pronged decision: decide whether or not to buy and, conditional on buying, choose which k out-neighbors to share access. We examine both pure and mixed Nash equilibria in the model from the perspective of existence, computation, and efficiency. We perform a comprehensive study for these three dimensions with respect to both sharing capacity (k) and the network structure (the underlying directed graph), and establish sharp complexity dichotomies for each.

Result: 证明了基于No-instances存在的收敛性判定困难性，发现在ASHGs中从单例分区开始的CIS动态可能在线性步数内收敛，但最坏情况下需要指数步数。

Conclusion: 该研究为享乐博弈中的稳定性分析提供了理论基础，揭示了收敛性判定的计算复杂性，并为寻找CIS分区提供了动态方法。

Abstract: Computing stable partitions in hedonic games is a challenging task because there exist games in which stable outcomes do not exist. Even more, these No-instances can often be leveraged to prove computational hardness results. We make this impression rigorous in a dynamic model of cardinal hedonic games by providing meta theorems. These imply hardness of deciding about the possible or necessary convergence of deviation dynamics based on the mere existence of No-instances. Our results hold for additively separable, fractional, and modified fractional hedonic games (ASHGs, FHGs, and MFHGs). Moreover, they encompass essentially all reasonable stability notions based on single-agent deviations. In addition, we propose dynamics as a method to find individually rational and contractually individual stable (CIS) partitions in ASHGs. In particular, we find that CIS dynamics from the singleton partition possibly converge after a linear number of deviations but may require an exponential number of deviations in the worst case.

Conclusion: 提出的增量式控制框架能够有效处理未知随机系统的时序逻辑控制问题，通过利用单调性特性实现了高效的数据驱动控制策略合成。

Abstract: We address the synthesis of control policies for unknown discrete-time stochastic dynamical systems to satisfy temporal logic objectives. We present a data-driven, abstraction-based control framework that integrates online learning with novel incremental game-solving. Under appropriate continuity assumptions, our method abstracts the system dynamics into a finite stochastic (2.5-player) game graph derived from data. Given a requirement over time on this graph, we compute the winning region -- i.e., the set of initial states from which the objective is satisfiable -- in the resulting game, together with a corresponding control policy.
  Our main contribution is the construction of abstractions, winning regions and control policies incrementally, as data about the system dynamics accumulates. Concretely, our algorithm refines under- and over-approximations of reachable sets for each state-action pair as new data samples arrive. These refinements induce structural modifications in the game graph abstraction -- such as the addition or removal of nodes and edges -- which in turn modify the winning region. Crucially, we show that these updates are inherently monotonic: under-approximations can only grow, over-approximations can only shrink, and the winning region can only expand.
  We exploit this monotonicity by defining an objective-induced ranking function on the nodes of the abstract game that increases monotonically as new data samples are incorporated. These ranks underpin our novel incremental game-solving algorithm, which employs customized gadgets (DAG-like subgames) within a rank-lifting algorithm to efficiently update the winning region. Numerical case studies demonstrate significant computational savings compared to the baseline approach, which resolves the entire game from scratch whenever new data samples arrive.

Abstract: Real-time energy forecasting on edge devices represents a major challenge for smart grid optimization and intelligent buildings. We present LAD-BNet (Lag-Aware Dual-Branch Network), an innovative neural architecture optimized for edge inference with Google Coral TPU. Our hybrid approach combines a branch dedicated to explicit exploitation of temporal lags with a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) featuring dilated convolutions, enabling simultaneous capture of short and long-term dependencies. Tested on real energy consumption data with 10-minute temporal resolution, LAD-BNet achieves 14.49% MAPE at 1-hour horizon with only 18ms inference time on Edge TPU, representing an 8-12 x acceleration compared to CPU. The multi-scale architecture enables predictions up to 12 hours with controlled performance degradation. Our model demonstrates a 2.39% improvement over LSTM baselines and 3.04% over pure TCN architectures, while maintaining a 180MB memory footprint suitable for embedded device constraints. These results pave the way for industrial applications in real-time energy optimization, demand management, and operational planning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据集通常呈现长尾分布，现有参数高效微调方法在提升尾部类别性能时会损害头部类别准确率，且头尾比例这一关键因素被忽视。

Method: 提出LT-Soups两阶段框架：第一阶段在平衡子集上微调模型并平均以减少头部类别偏差；第二阶段仅在完整数据集上微调分类器以恢复头部类别准确率。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上的实验表明，LT-Soups在广泛的不平衡范围内相比PEFT和传统模型融合方法实现了更优的性能平衡。

Conclusion: LT-Soups能够有效应对不同长尾分布场景，在保持尾部类别性能的同时不损害头部类别准确率，提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world datasets typically exhibit long-tailed (LT) distributions, where a few head classes dominate and many tail classes are severely underrepresented. While recent work shows that parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA and AdaptFormer preserve tail-class performance on foundation models such as CLIP, we find that they do so at the cost of head-class accuracy. We identify the head-tail ratio, the proportion of head to tail classes, as a crucial but overlooked factor influencing this trade-off. Through controlled experiments on CIFAR100 with varying imbalance ratio ($ρ$) and head-tail ratio ($η$), we show that PEFT excels in tail-heavy scenarios but degrades in more balanced and head-heavy distributions. To overcome these limitations, we propose LT-Soups, a two-stage model soups framework designed to generalize across diverse LT regimes. In the first stage, LT-Soups averages models fine-tuned on balanced subsets to reduce head-class bias; in the second, it fine-tunes only the classifier on the full dataset to restore head-class accuracy. Experiments across six benchmark datasets show that LT-Soups achieves superior trade-offs compared to both PEFT and traditional model soups across a wide range of imbalance regimes.

Abstract: Data-driven discovery of governing equations from data remains a fundamental challenge in nonlinear dynamics. Although sparse regression techniques have advanced system identification, they struggle with rational functions and noise sensitivity in complex mechanical systems. The Lagrangian formalism offers a promising alternative, as it typically avoids rational expressions and provides a more concise representation of system dynamics. However, existing Lagrangian identification methods are significantly affected by measurement noise and limited data availability. This paper presents a novel differentiable sparse identification framework that addresses these limitations through three key contributions: (1) the first integration of cubic B-Spline approximation into Lagrangian system identification, enabling accurate representation of complex nonlinearities, (2) a robust equation discovery mechanism that effectively utilizes measurements while incorporating known physical constraints, (3) a recursive derivative computation scheme based on B-spline basis functions, effectively constraining higher-order derivatives and reducing noise sensitivity on second-order dynamical systems. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance and enables more accurate and reliable extraction of physical laws from noisy data, particularly in complex mechanical systems compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient finetuning (PEFT) enhances model performance on downstream tasks by updating a minimal subset of parameters. Representation finetuning (ReFT) methods further improve efficiency by freezing model weights and optimizing internal representations with fewer parameters than PEFT, outperforming PEFT on several tasks. However, ReFT exhibits a significant performance decline on mathematical reasoning tasks. To address this problem, the paper demonstrates that ReFT's poor performance on mathematical tasks primarily stems from its struggle to generate effective reasoning prefixes during the early inference phase. Moreover, ReFT disturbs the numerical encoding and the error accumulats during the CoT stage. Based on these observations, this paper proposes Bias-REstrained Prefix Representation FineTuning (BREP ReFT), which enhances ReFT's mathematical reasoning capability by truncating training data to optimize the generation of initial reasoning prefixes, intervening on the early inference stage to prevent error accumulation, and constraining the intervention vectors' magnitude to avoid disturbing numerical encoding. Extensive experiments across diverse model architectures demonstrate BREP's superior effectiveness, efficiency, and robust generalization capability, outperforming both standard ReFT and weight-based PEFT methods on the task of mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: While generative models have become increasingly prevalent across various domains, fundamental concerns regarding their reliability persist. A crucial yet understudied aspect of these models is the uncertainty quantification surrounding their distribution approximation capabilities. Current evaluation methodologies focus predominantly on measuring the closeness between the learned and the target distributions, neglecting the inherent uncertainty in these measurements. In this position paper, we formalize the problem of uncertainty quantification in generative model learning. We discuss potential research directions, including the use of ensemble-based precision-recall curves. Our preliminary experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of aggregated precision-recall curves in capturing model approximation uncertainty, enabling systematic comparison among different model architectures based on their uncertainty characteristics.

Abstract: The functional independence measure (FIM) is widely used to evaluate patients' physical independence in activities of daily living. However, traditional FIM assessment imposes a significant burden on both patients and healthcare professionals. To address this challenge, we propose an automated FIM score estimation method that utilizes simple exercises different from the designated FIM assessment actions. Our approach employs a deep neural network architecture integrating a spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN), bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), and an attention mechanism to estimate FIM motor item scores. The model effectively captures long-term temporal dependencies and identifies key body-joint contributions through learned attention weights. We evaluated our method in a study of 277 rehabilitation patients, focusing on FIM transfer and locomotion items. Our approach successfully distinguishes between completely independent patients and those requiring assistance, achieving balanced accuracies of 70.09-78.79 % across different FIM items. Additionally, our analysis reveals specific movement patterns that serve as reliable predictors for particular FIM evaluation items.

Conclusion: 矩阵自由随机方法能够显著加速NTK的分析和应用，为复杂模型的NTK计算提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) characterizes how a model's state evolves over Gradient Descent. Computing the full NTK matrix is often infeasible, especially for recurrent architectures. Here, we introduce a matrix-free perspective, using trace estimation to rapidly analyze the empirical, finite-width NTK. This enables fast computation of the NTK's trace, Frobenius norm, effective rank, and alignment. We provide numerical recipes based on the Hutch++ trace estimator with provably fast convergence guarantees. In addition, we show that, due to the structure of the NTK, one can compute the trace using only forward- or reverse-mode automatic differentiation, not requiring both modes. We show these so-called one-sided estimators can outperform Hutch++ in the low-sample regime, especially when the gap between the model state and parameter count is large. In total, our results demonstrate that matrix-free randomized approaches can yield speedups of many orders of magnitude, leading to faster analysis and applications of the NTK.

Abstract: Linear Predictive Clustering (LPC) partitions samples based on shared linear relationships between feature and target variables, with numerous applications including marketing, medicine, and education. Greedy optimization methods, commonly used for LPC, alternate between clustering and linear regression but lack global optimality. While effective for separable clusters, they struggle in non-separable settings where clusters overlap in feature space. In an alternative constrained optimization paradigm, Bertsimas and Shioda (2007) formulated LPC as a Mixed-Integer Program (MIP), ensuring global optimality regardless of separability but suffering from poor scalability. This work builds on the constrained optimization paradigm to introduce two novel approaches that improve the efficiency of global optimization for LPC. By leveraging key theoretical properties of separability, we derive near-optimal approximations with provable error bounds, significantly reducing the MIP formulation's complexity and improving scalability. Additionally, we can further approximate LPC as a Quadratic Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (QPBO) problem, achieving substantial computational improvements in some settings. Comparative analyses on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods consistently achieve near-optimal solutions with substantially lower regression errors than greedy optimization while exhibiting superior scalability over existing MIP formulations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究Transformer预测Collatz序列长步长的能力，发现模型准确率随编码基数变化（最高99.7%，最低25%），所有模型都学习相同的模式：按输入模2^p的余数分类学习，准确率接近完美，这对应Collatz序列的数学特性。

Motivation: 使用数学问题作为工具来理解、解释并可能改进语言模型，探索模型学习复杂算术函数的能力和模式。

Method: 使用不同基数编码输入输出，训练Transformer模型预测Collatz序列的长步长，分析模型学习过程和错误模式。

Result: 模型准确率随基数变化（24和32基数达99.7%，11和3基数仅37%和25%），学习模式一致：按模2^p余数分类学习，失败案例中90%是正确计算但错误估计循环长度。

Conclusion: 学习复杂算术函数的难点在于理解计算的控制结构（循环长度），使用数学问题作为分析工具的方法可广泛应用于其他问题并产生丰硕成果。

Abstract: We investigate transformer prediction of long Collatz steps, a complex arithmetic function that maps odd integers to their distant successors in the Collatz sequence ( $u_{n+1}=u_n/2$ if $u_n$ is even, $u_{n+1}=(3u_n+1)/2$ if $u_n$ is odd). Model accuracy varies with the base used to encode input and output. It can be as high as $99.7\%$ for bases $24$ and $32$, and as low as $37$ and $25\%$ for bases $11$ and $3$. Yet, all models, no matter the base, follow a common learning pattern. As training proceeds, they learn a sequence of classes of inputs that share the same residual modulo $2^p$. Models achieve near-perfect accuracy on these classes, and less than $1\%$ for all other inputs. This maps to a mathematical property of Collatz sequences: the length of the loops involved in the computation of a long Collatz step can be deduced from the binary representation of its input. The learning pattern reflects the model learning to predict inputs associated with increasing loop lengths. An analysis of failure cases reveals that almost all model errors follow predictable patterns. Hallucination, a common feature of large language models, almost never happens. In over $90\%$ of failures, the model performs the correct calculation, but wrongly estimates loop lengths. Our observations give a full account of the algorithms learned by the models. They suggest that the difficulty of learning such complex arithmetic function lies in figuring the control structure of the computation -- the length of the loops. We believe that the approach outlined here, using mathematical problems as tools for understanding, explaining, and perhaps improving language models, can be applied to a broad range of problems and bear fruitful results.

Abstract: Although neural operators are widely used in data-driven physical simulations, their training remains computationally expensive. Recent advances address this issue via downstream learning, where a model pretrained on simpler problems is fine-tuned on more complex ones. In this research, we investigate transformer-based neural operators, which have previously been applied only to specific problems, in a more general transfer learning setting. We evaluate their performance across diverse PDE problems, including extrapolation to unseen parameters, incorporation of new variables, and transfer from multi-equation datasets. Our results demonstrate that advanced neural operator architectures can effectively transfer knowledge across PDE problems.

Abstract: Quantum kernel methods are a promising branch of quantum machine learning, yet their practical advantage on diverse, high-dimensional, real-world data remains unverified. Current research has largely been limited to low-dimensional or synthetic datasets, preventing a thorough evaluation of their potential. To address this gap, we developed a variational quantum kernel framework utilizing resource-efficient ansätze for complex classification tasks and introduced a parameter scaling technique to accelerate convergence. We conducted a comprehensive benchmark of this framework on eight challenging, real world and high-dimensional datasets covering tabular, image, time series, and graph data. Our classically simulated results show that the proposed quantum kernel demonstrated a clear performance advantage over standard classical kernels, such as the radial basis function (RBF) kernel. This work demonstrates that properly designed quantum kernels can function as versatile, high-performance tools, laying a foundation for quantum-enhanced applications in real-world machine learning. Further research is needed to fully assess the practical quantum advantage.

Abstract: Equation discovery from data is a core challenge in machine learning for science, requiring the recovery of concise symbolic expressions that govern complex physical and geometric phenomena. Recent approaches with large language models (LLMs) show promise in symbolic regression, but their success often hinges on memorized formulas or overly simplified functional forms. Existing benchmarks exacerbate this limitation: they focus on scalar functions, ignore domain grounding, and rely on brittle string-matching based metrics that fail to capture scientific equivalence. We introduce SurfaceBench, first comprehensive benchmark for symbolic surface discovery. SurfaceBench comprises 183 tasks across 15 categories of symbolic complexity, spanning explicit, implicit, and parametric equation representation forms. Each task includes ground-truth equations, variable semantics, and synthetically sampled three dimensional data. Unlike prior SR datasets, our tasks reflect surface-level structure, resist LLM memorization through novel symbolic compositions, and are grounded in scientific domains such as fluid dynamics, robotics, electromagnetics, and geometry. To evaluate equation discovery quality, we pair symbolic checks with geometry-aware metrics such as Chamfer and Hausdorff distances, capturing both algebraic fidelity and spatial reconstruction accuracy. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art frameworks, while occasionally successful on specific families, struggle to generalize across representation types and surface complexities. SurfaceBench thus establishes a challenging and diagnostic testbed that bridges symbolic reasoning with geometric reconstruction, enabling principled benchmarking of progress in compositional generalization, data-driven scientific induction, and geometry-aware reasoning with LLMs. We release the code here: https://github.com/Sanchit-404/surfacebench

TL;DR: EarthSight是一个分布式卫星图像智能框架，通过多任务推理、地面站查询调度和动态过滤器排序，显著降低卫星图像分析的延迟和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卫星图像传输管道需要将所有图像下传后分析，导致数小时到数天的延迟。现有解决方案将每颗卫星视为独立计算节点，存在冗余推理、资源受限等问题。

Method: 1) 卫星上多任务推理使用共享骨干网络；2) 地面站查询调度器聚合用户请求并预测优先级；3) 动态过滤器排序整合模型选择性、准确性和执行成本。

Result: 与现有最先进基线相比，EarthSight将每张图像的平均计算时间减少1.9倍，90%分位数端到端延迟从51分钟降至21分钟。

Conclusion: EarthSight通过轨道和地面之间的分布式决策，使卫星星座能够在严格的下行带宽和机载功率预算内执行可扩展、低延迟的图像分析。

Abstract: Low-latency delivery of satellite imagery is essential for time-critical applications such as disaster response, intelligence, and infrastructure monitoring. However, traditional pipelines rely on downlinking all captured images before analysis, introducing delays of hours to days due to restricted communication bandwidth. To address these bottlenecks, emerging systems perform onboard machine learning to prioritize which images to transmit. However, these solutions typically treat each satellite as an isolated compute node, limiting scalability and efficiency. Redundant inference across satellites and tasks further strains onboard power and compute costs, constraining mission scope and responsiveness. We present EarthSight, a distributed runtime framework that redefines satellite image intelligence as a distributed decision problem between orbit and ground. EarthSight introduces three core innovations: (1) multi-task inference on satellites using shared backbones to amortize computation across multiple vision tasks; (2) a ground-station query scheduler that aggregates user requests, predicts priorities, and assigns compute budgets to incoming imagery; and (3) dynamic filter ordering, which integrates model selectivity, accuracy, and execution cost to reject low-value images early and conserve resources. EarthSight leverages global context from ground stations and resource-aware adaptive decisions in orbit to enable constellations to perform scalable, low-latency image analysis within strict downlink bandwidth and onboard power budgets. Evaluations using a prior established satellite simulator show that EarthSight reduces average compute time per image by 1.9x and lowers 90th percentile end-to-end latency from first contact to delivery from 51 to 21 minutes compared to the state-of-the-art baseline.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains, yet remain susceptible to hallucinations. While prior works have proposed confidence representation methods for hallucination detection, most of these approaches rely on computationally expensive sampling strategies and often disregard the distinction between hallucination types. In this work, we introduce a principled evaluation framework that differentiates between extrinsic and intrinsic hallucination categories and evaluates detection performance across a suite of curated benchmarks. In addition, we leverage a recent attention-based uncertainty quantification algorithm and propose novel attention aggregation strategies that improve both interpretability and hallucination detection performance. Our experimental findings reveal that sampling-based methods like Semantic Entropy are effective for detecting extrinsic hallucinations but generally fail on intrinsic ones. In contrast, our method, which aggregates attention over input tokens, is better suited for intrinsic hallucinations. These insights provide new directions for aligning detection strategies with the nature of hallucination and highlight attention as a rich signal for quantifying model uncertainty.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlowPath提出了一种通过可逆神经流学习控制路径几何形状的新方法，用于处理稀疏和不规则采样的时间序列数据，相比固定插值方法在分类准确率上取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经控制微分方程在处理稀疏不规则时间序列时，其性能高度依赖于从离散观测构建的控制路径选择。固定插值方案强加了简化的几何假设，往往无法准确表示底层数据流形，特别是在高缺失率情况下。

Method: FlowPath通过可逆神经流学习控制路径的几何形状，构建连续且数据自适应的流形。可逆性约束确保信息保持和良好行为的变换，这与先前无约束可学习路径模型形成区别。

Result: 在18个基准数据集和真实世界案例研究上的实证评估表明，FlowPath相比使用固定插值或不可逆架构的基线方法，在分类准确率上持续取得统计显著的改进。

Conclusion: 结果表明，不仅需要建模路径上的动态，还需要建模路径本身的几何形状，这为从不规则时间序列中学习提供了稳健且可泛化的解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling continuous-time dynamics from sparse and irregularly-sampled time series remains a fundamental challenge. Neural controlled differential equations provide a principled framework for such tasks, yet their performance is highly sensitive to the choice of control path constructed from discrete observations. Existing methods commonly employ fixed interpolation schemes, which impose simplistic geometric assumptions that often misrepresent the underlying data manifold, particularly under high missingness. We propose FlowPath, a novel approach that learns the geometry of the control path via an invertible neural flow. Rather than merely connecting observations, FlowPath constructs a continuous and data-adaptive manifold, guided by invertibility constraints that enforce information-preserving and well-behaved transformations. This inductive bias distinguishes FlowPath from prior unconstrained learnable path models. Empirical evaluations on 18 benchmark datasets and a real-world case study demonstrate that FlowPath consistently achieves statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy over baselines using fixed interpolants or non-invertible architectures. These results highlight the importance of modeling not only the dynamics along the path but also the geometry of the path itself, offering a robust and generalizable solution for learning from irregular time series.

Conclusion: 收集在线数据不一定是最优的，通过精心设计的行为策略收集离线数据可以获得方差更低的回报估计，从而提高强化学习算法的效率。

Abstract: Many reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly those that rely on return estimates for policy improvement, can suffer from poor sample efficiency and training instability due to high-variance return estimates. In this paper we leverage new results from off-policy evaluation; it has recently been shown that well-designed behaviour policies can be used to collect off-policy data for provably lower variance return estimates. This result is surprising as it means collecting data on-policy is not variance optimal. We extend this key insight to the online reinforcement learning setting, where both policy evaluation and improvement are interleaved to learn optimal policies. Off-policy RL has been well studied (e.g., IMPALA), with correct and truncated importance weighted samples for de-biasing and managing variance appropriately. Generally these approaches are concerned with reconciling data collected from multiple workers in parallel, while the policy is updated asynchronously, mismatch between the workers and policy is corrected in a mathematically sound way. Here we consider only one worker - the behaviour policy, which is used to collect data for policy improvement, with provably lower variance return estimates. In our experiments we extend two policy-gradient methods with this regime, demonstrating better sample efficiency and performance over a diverse set of environments.

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) pretrained on data from multiple domains have shown strong performance on diverse modeling tasks. Various efforts have been made to develop foundation models specific to electroencephalography (EEG) data, which records brain electrical activity as time series. However, no comparative analysis of EEG-specific foundation models (EEGFMs) versus general TSFMs has been performed on EEG-specific tasks. We introduce a novel Spatial-Temporal Adapter with Multi-Head Pooling (STAMP), which leverages univariate embeddings produced by a general TSFM, implicitly models spatial-temporal characteristics of EEG data, and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art EEGFMs. A comprehensive analysis is performed on 8 benchmark datasets of clinical tasks using EEG for classification, along with ablation studies. Our proposed adapter is lightweight in trainable parameters and flexible in the inputs it can accommodate, supporting easy modeling of EEG data using TSFMs.

Method: 提出ExPairT-LLM算法，通过向LLM提出成对成员资格和成对等价性两种简化查询，通过锦标赛机制选择正确程序，对某些LLM错误具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ExPairT-LLM通过简化的成对查询和锦标赛机制，有效提高了代码选择的准确性，对LLM错误具有鲁棒性，显著提升了代码生成的成功率。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in LLMs, the task of code generation is still challenging. To cope, code selection algorithms select the best program from multiple programs generated by an LLM. However, existing algorithms can fail to identify the correct program, either because they can misidentify nonequivalent programs or because they rely on an LLM and assume it always correctly determines the output for every input. We present ExPairT-LLM, an exact learning algorithm for code selection that selects a program by posing to an LLM oracle two new types of queries: pairwise membership and pairwise equivalence. These queries are simpler for LLMs and enable ExPairT-LLM to identify the correct program through a tournament, which is robust to some LLM mistakes. We evaluate ExPairT-LLM on four popular code datasets. Its pass@1 (success rate) outperforms the state-of-the-art code selection algorithm on average by +13.0% and up to +27.1%. It also improves the pass@1 of LLMs performing complex reasoning by +24.0%.

Conclusion: 公共数据辅助的零阶优化方法在隐私保护机器学习中具有显著优势，特别是在高隐私保护需求下

Abstract: One of the major bottlenecks for deploying popular first-order differentially private (DP) machine learning algorithms (e.g., DP-SGD) lies in their high computation and memory cost, despite the existence of optimized implementations. Zeroth-order methods have promise in mitigating the overhead, as they leverage function evaluations to approximate the gradients, hence significantly easier to privatize. While recent works have explored zeroth-order approaches in both private and non-private settings, they still suffer from relatively low utilities compared with DP-SGD, and have only been evaluated in limited application domains. In this work, we propose to leverage public information to guide and improve gradient approximation of private zeroth-order algorithms. We explore a suite of public-data-assisted zeroth-order optimizers (PAZO) with minimal overhead. We provide theoretical analyses of the PAZO framework under an assumption of the similarity between public and private data. Empirically, we demonstrate that PAZO achieves superior privacy/utility tradeoffs across vision and text tasks in both pre-training and fine-tuning settings, outperforming the best first-order baselines (with public data) especially in highly private regimes, while offering up to $16\times$ runtime speedup.

Abstract: The integration of graphs with Goal-conditioned Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (GCHRL) has recently gained attention, as intermediate goals (subgoals) can be effectively sampled from graphs that naturally represent the overall task structure in most RL tasks. However, existing approaches typically rely on domain-specific knowledge to construct these graphs, limiting their applicability to new tasks. Other graph-based approaches create graphs dynamically during exploration but struggle to fully utilize them, because they have problems passing the information in the graphs to newly visited states. Additionally, current GCHRL methods face challenges such as sample inefficiency and poor subgoal representation. This paper proposes a solution to these issues by developing a graph encoder-decoder to evaluate unseen states. Our proposed method, Graph-Guided sub-Goal representation Generation RL (G4RL), can be incorporated into any existing GCHRL method when operating in environments with primarily symmetric and reversible transitions to enhance performance across this class of problems. We show that the graph encoder-decoder can be effectively implemented using a network trained on the state graph generated during exploration. Empirical results indicate that leveraging high and low-level intrinsic rewards from the graph encoder-decoder significantly enhances the performance of state-of-the-art GCHRL approaches with an extra small computational cost in dense and sparse reward environments.

Abstract: Time-efficient estimation of muscle activations and forces across multi-joint systems is critical for clinical assessment and assistive device control. However, conventional approaches are computationally expensive and lack a high-quality labeled dataset for multi-joint applications. To address these challenges, we propose a physics-informed deep learning framework that estimates muscle activations and forces directly from kinematics. The framework employs a novel Multi-Joint Cross-Attention (MJCA) module with Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) layers to capture inter-joint coordination, enabling each joint to adaptively integrate motion information from others. By embedding multi-joint dynamics, inter-joint coupling, and external force interactions into the loss function, our Physics-Informed MJCA-BiGRU (PI-MJCA-BiGRU) delivers physiologically consistent predictions without labeled data while enabling time-efficient inference. Experimental validation on two datasets demonstrates that PI-MJCA-BiGRU achieves performance comparable to conventional supervised methods without requiring ground-truth labels, while the MJCA module significantly enhances inter-joint coordination modeling compared to other baseline architectures.

Abstract: Natural disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, and winter storms have induced large-scale power outages in the U.S., resulting in tremendous economic and societal impacts. Accurately predicting power outage recovery and impact is key to resilience of power grid. Recent advances in machine learning offer viable frameworks for estimating power outage duration from geospatial and weather data. However, three major challenges are inherent to the task in a real world setting: spatial dependency of the data, spatial heterogeneity of the impact, and moderate event data. We propose a novel approach to estimate the duration of severe weather-induced power outages through Graph Attention Networks (GAT). Our network uses a simple structure from unsupervised pre-training, followed by semi-supervised learning. We use field data from four major hurricanes affecting $501$ counties in eight Southeastern U.S. states. The model exhibits an excellent performance ($>93\%$ accuracy) and outperforms the existing methods XGBoost, Random Forest, GCN and simple GAT by $2\% - 15\%$ in both the overall performance and class-wise accuracy.

Conclusion: SPP-FGC框架通过结构图作为隐私保护知识共享媒介，成功解决了联邦聚类中的性能-隐私权衡问题，为复杂非结构化数据提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated clustering addresses the critical challenge of extracting patterns from decentralized, unlabeled data. However, it is hampered by the flaw that current approaches are forced to accept a compromise between performance and privacy: \textit{transmitting embedding representations risks sensitive data leakage, while sharing only abstract cluster prototypes leads to diminished model accuracy}. To resolve this dilemma, we propose Structural Privacy-Preserving Federated Graph Clustering (SPP-FGC), a novel algorithm that innovatively leverages local structural graphs as the primary medium for privacy-preserving knowledge sharing, thus moving beyond the limitations of conventional techniques. Our framework operates on a clear client-server logic; on the client-side, each participant constructs a private structural graph that captures intrinsic data relationships, which the server then securely aggregates and aligns to form a comprehensive global graph from which a unified clustering structure is derived. The framework offers two distinct modes to suit different needs. SPP-FGC is designed as an efficient one-shot method that completes its task in a single communication round, ideal for rapid analysis. For more complex, unstructured data like images, SPP-FGC+ employs an iterative process where clients and the server collaboratively refine feature representations to achieve superior downstream performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving clustering accuracy by up to 10\% (NMI) over federated baselines while maintaining provable privacy guarantees.

Conclusion: GraphToxin揭示了图遗忘方法的严重隐私风险，迫切需要开发更有效的防御策略来应对此类攻击。

Abstract: Graph unlearning has emerged as a promising solution for complying with "the right to be forgotten" regulations by enabling the removal of sensitive information upon request. However, this solution is not foolproof. The involvement of multiple parties creates new attack surfaces, and residual traces of deleted data can still remain in the unlearned graph neural networks. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to recover the supposedly erased samples, thereby undermining the inherent functionality of graph unlearning. In this work, we propose GraphToxin, the first graph reconstruction attack against graph unlearning. Specifically, we introduce a novel curvature matching module to provide a fine-grained guidance for full unlearned graph recovery. We demonstrate that GraphToxin can successfully subvert the regulatory guarantees expected from graph unlearning - it can recover not only a deleted individual's information and personal links but also sensitive content from their connections, thereby posing substantially more detrimental threats. Furthermore, we extend GraphToxin to multiple node removals under both white-box and black-box setting. We highlight the necessity of a worst-case analysis and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework to systematically assess the attack performance under both random and worst-case node removals. This provides a more robust and realistic measure of the vulnerability of graph unlearning methods to graph reconstruction attacks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of GraphToxin. Notably, we show that existing defense mechanisms are largely ineffective against this attack and, in some cases, can even amplify its performance. Given the severe privacy risks posed by GraphToxin, our work underscores the urgent need for the development of more effective and robust defense strategies against this attack.

Method: 分析四种决策策略：Explore-then-Commit、Action Elimination、Lower Confidence Bound (LCB)和Thompson Sampling，提供理论遗憾保证分析。

Result: Explore-then-Commit和Action Elimination因在探索阶段后固定顺序而遭受次优遗憾，而LCB和Thompson Sampling通过持续更新决策实现常数O(1)遗憾。

Conclusion: 适应性在不确定条件下对高效边缘推理至关重要，LCB和Thompson Sampling因持续适应反馈而优于固定顺序策略。

Abstract: Motivated by the challenges of edge inference, we study a variant of the cascade bandit model in which each arm corresponds to an inference model with an associated accuracy and error probability. We analyse four decision-making policies-Explore-then-Commit, Action Elimination, Lower Confidence Bound (LCB), and Thompson Sampling-and provide sharp theoretical regret guarantees for each. Unlike in classical bandit settings, Explore-then-Commit and Action Elimination incur suboptimal regret because they commit to a fixed ordering after the exploration phase, limiting their ability to adapt. In contrast, LCB and Thompson Sampling continuously update their decisions based on observed feedback, achieving constant O(1) regret. Simulations corroborate these theoretical findings, highlighting the crucial role of adaptivity for efficient edge inference under uncertainty.

Abstract: Diffusion model (DM)-based channel estimation, which generates channel samples via a posteriori sampling stepwise with denoising process, has shown potential in high-precision channel state information (CSI) acquisition. However, slow sampling speed is an essential challenge for recent developed DM-based schemes. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel flow matching (FM)-based generative model for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel estimation. We first formulate the channel estimation problem within FM framework, where the conditional probability path is constructed from the noisy channel distribution to the true channel distribution. In this case, the path evolves along the straight-line trajectory at a constant speed. Then, guided by this, we derive the velocity field that depends solely on the noise statistics to guide generative models training. Furthermore, during the sampling phase, we utilize the trained velocity field as prior information for channel estimation, which allows for quick and reliable noise channel enhancement via ordinary differential equation (ODE) Euler solver. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed FM-based channel estimation scheme can significantly reduce the sampling overhead compared to other popular DM-based schemes, such as the score matching (SM)-based scheme. Meanwhile, it achieves superior channel estimation accuracy under different channel conditions.

Abstract: Model merging combines expert models for multitask performance but faces challenges from parameter interference. This has sparked recent interest in controllable model merging, giving users the ability to explicitly balance performance trade-offs. Existing approaches employ a compile-then-query paradigm, performing a costly offline multi-objective optimization to enable fast, preference-aware model generation. This offline stage typically involves iterative search or dedicated training, with complexity that grows exponentially with the number of tasks. To overcome these limitations, we shift the perspective from parameter-space optimization to a direct correction of the model's final representation. Our approach models this correction as an optimal linear transformation, yielding a closed-form solution that replaces the entire offline optimization process with a single-step, architecture-agnostic computation. This solution directly incorporates user preferences, allowing a Pareto-optimal model to be generated on-the-fly with complexity that scales linearly with the number of tasks. Experimental results show our method generates a superior Pareto front with more precise preference alignment and drastically reduced computational cost.

Conclusion: 这是首次建立URDA范式和理论，DART算法简单有效，能同时确保迁移性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a label-rich source domain to an unlabeled target domain by addressing domain shifts. Most UDA approaches emphasize transfer ability, but often overlook robustness against adversarial attacks. Although vanilla adversarial training (VAT) improves the robustness of deep neural networks, it has little effect on UDA. This paper focuses on answering three key questions: 1) Why does VAT, known for its defensive effectiveness, fail in the UDA paradigm? 2) What is the generalization bound theory under attacks and how does it evolve from classical UDA theory? 3) How can we implement a robustification training procedure without complex modifications? Specifically, we explore and reveal the inherent entanglement challenge in general UDA+VAT paradigm, and propose an unsupervised robust domain adaptation (URDA) paradigm. We further derive the generalization bound theory of the URDA paradigm so that it can resist adversarial noise and domain shift. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to establish the URDA paradigm and theory. We further introduce a simple, novel yet effective URDA algorithm called Disentangled Adversarial Robustness Training (DART), a two-step training procedure that ensures both transferability and robustness. DART first pre-trains an arbitrary UDA model, and then applies an instantaneous robustification post-training step via disentangled distillation.Experiments on four benchmark datasets with/without attacks show that DART effectively enhances robustness while maintaining domain adaptability, and validate the URDA paradigm and theory.

Conclusion: NCMP框架为增强传统GNN的图表示能力提供了一条实用的路径。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become an indispensable tool for analyzing relational data. In the literature, classical GNNs may be classified into three variants: convolutional, attentional, and message-passing. While the standard message-passing variant is highly expressive, its typical pair-wise messages nevertheless only consider the features of the center node and each neighboring node individually. This design fails to incorporate the rich contextual information contained within the broader local neighborhood, potentially hindering its ability to learn complex relationships within the entire set of neighboring nodes. To address this limitation, this work first formalizes the concept of neighborhood-contextualization, rooted in a key property of the attentional variant. This then serves as the foundation for generalizing the message-passing variant to the proposed neighborhood-contextualized message-passing (NCMP) framework. To demonstrate its utility, a simple, practical, and efficient method to parametrize and operationalize NCMP is presented, leading to the development of the proposed Soft-Isomorphic Neighborhood-Contextualized Graph Convolution Network (SINC-GCN). A preliminary analysis on a synthetic binary node classification problem then underscores both the expressivity and efficiency of the proposed GNN architecture. Overall, the paper lays the foundation for the novel NCMP framework as a practical path toward further enhancing the graph representational power of classical GNNs.

Conclusion: Echoless-LP有效解决了异质图神经网络中的训练标签泄漏问题，提供了一种内存高效且兼容性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) are widely used for deep learning on heterogeneous graphs. Typical end-to-end HGNNs require repetitive message passing during training, limiting efficiency for large-scale real-world graphs. Pre-computation-based HGNNs address this by performing message passing only once during preprocessing, collecting neighbor information into regular-shaped tensors, which enables efficient mini-batch training. Label-based pre-computation methods collect neighbors' label information but suffer from training label leakage, where a node's own label information propagates back to itself during multi-hop message passing - the echo effect. Existing mitigation strategies are memory-inefficient on large graphs or suffer from compatibility issues with advanced message passing methods. We propose Echoless Label-based Pre-computation (Echoless-LP), which eliminates training label leakage with Partition-Focused Echoless Propagation (PFEP). PFEP partitions target nodes and performs echoless propagation, where nodes in each partition collect label information only from neighbors in other partitions, avoiding echo while remaining memory-efficient and compatible with any message passing method. We also introduce an Asymmetric Partitioning Scheme (APS) and a PostAdjust mechanism to address information loss from partitioning and distributional shifts across partitions. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that Echoless-LP achieves superior performance and maintains memory efficiency compared to baselines.

Abstract: Zero-shot coordination(ZSC) has become a hot topic in reinforcement learning research recently. It focuses on the generalization ability of agents, requiring them to coordinate well with collaborators that are not seen before without any fine-tuning. Population-based training has been proven to provide good zero-shot coordination performance; nevertheless, existing methods are limited by computational resources, mainly focusing on optimizing diversity in small populations while neglecting the potential performance gains from scaling population size. To address this issue, this paper proposes the Scalable Population Training (ScaPT), an efficient training framework comprising two key components: a meta-agent that efficiently realizes a population by selectively sharing parameters across agents, and a mutual information regularizer that guarantees population diversity. To empirically validate the effectiveness of ScaPT, this paper evaluates it along with representational frameworks in Hanabi and confirms its superiority.

Conclusion: 胞腔层形式化为分析预测编码网络提供了诊断工具和设计原则，有助于识别问题网络配置并改进循环网络的权重初始化策略。

Abstract: Predictive coding (PC) replaces global backpropagation with local optimization over weights and activations. We show that linear PC networks admit a natural formulation as cellular sheaves: the sheaf coboundary maps activations to edge-wise prediction errors, and PC inference is diffusion under the sheaf Laplacian. Sheaf cohomology then characterizes irreducible error patterns that inference cannot remove. We analyze recurrent topologies where feedback loops create internal contradictions, introducing prediction errors unrelated to supervision. Using a Hodge decomposition, we determine when these contradictions cause learning to stall. The sheaf formalism provides both diagnostic tools for identifying problematic network configurations and design principles for effective weight initialization for recurrent PC networks.

Abstract: The Dragonfly network, with its high-radix and low-diameter structure, is a leading interconnect in high-performance computing. A major challenge is workload interference on shared network links. Parallel discrete event simulation (PDES) is commonly used to analyze workload interference. However, high-fidelity PDES is computationally expensive, making it impractical for large-scale or real-time scenarios. Hybrid simulation that incorporates data-driven surrogate models offers a promising alternative, especially for forecasting application runtime, a task complicated by the dynamic behavior of network traffic. We present \ourmodel, a surrogate model that combines graph neural networks (GNNs) and large language models (LLMs) to capture both spatial and temporal patterns from port level router data. \ourmodel outperforms existing statistical and machine learning baselines, enabling accurate runtime prediction and supporting efficient hybrid simulation of Dragonfly networks.

Conclusion: 提出的初始化策略能有效提升知识图谱嵌入持续学习的性能，减少灾难性遗忘，加快学习速度

Abstract: Many Knowledege Graphs (KGs) are frequently updated, forcing their Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) to adapt to these changes. To address this problem, continual learning techniques for KGEs incorporate embeddings for new entities while updating the old ones. One necessary step in these methods is the initialization of the embeddings, as an input to the KGE learning process, which can have an important impact in the accuracy of the final embeddings, as well as in the time required to train them. This is especially relevant for relatively small and frequent updates. We propose a novel informed embedding initialization strategy, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing continual learning methods for KGE, that enhances the acquisition of new knowledge while reducing catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, the KG schema and the previously learned embeddings are utilized to obtain initial representations for the new entities, based on the classes the entities belong to. Our extensive experimental analysis shows that the proposed initialization strategy improves the predictive performance of the resulting KGEs, while also enhancing knowledge retention. Furthermore, our approach accelerates knowledge acquisition, reducing the number of epochs, and therefore time, required to incrementally learn new embeddings. Finally, its benefits across various types of KGE learning models are demonstrated.

Abstract: Detecting point anomalies in bank account balances is essential for financial institutions, as it enables the identification of potential fraud, operational issues, or other irregularities. Robust statistics is useful for flagging outliers and for providing estimates of the data distribution parameters that are not affected by contaminated observations. However, such a strategy is often less efficient and computationally expensive under high dimensional setting. In this paper, we propose and evaluate empirically several robust approaches that may be computationally efficient in medium and high dimensional datasets, with high breakdown points and low computational time. Our application deals with around 2.6 million daily records of anonymous users' bank account balances.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习降水预测模型通常作为黑箱运行，限制了在实际天气预报中的采用。为了在保持准确性的同时增强透明度，需要开发可解释的深度学习框架。

Method: 采用混合时间分布式CNN-ConvLSTM架构，基于多年代ERA5再分析数据训练。为每个城市优化卷积滤波器数量：班加罗尔(32)、孟买和德里(64)、加尔各答(128)。使用排列重要性、Grad-CAM、时间遮挡和反事实扰动进行可解释性分析。

Result: 模型在不同城市取得了不同的RMSE值：班加罗尔0.21毫米/天、孟买0.52毫米/天、德里0.48毫米/天、加尔各答1.80毫米/天。预测范围从班加罗尔的1天到加尔各答的5天不等。

Conclusion: 研究表明可解释AI能够为不同城市环境提供准确的降水预测和透明洞察，模型依赖城市特定变量，展示了xAI在多样化城市环境中应用的可行性。

Abstract: Deep learning models for precipitation forecasting often function as black boxes, limiting their adoption in real-world weather prediction. To enhance transparency while maintaining accuracy, we developed an interpretable deep learning framework for short-term precipitation prediction in four major Indian cities: Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, and Kolkata, spanning diverse climate zones. We implemented a hybrid Time-Distributed CNN-ConvLSTM (Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory) architecture, trained on multi-decadal ERA5 reanalysis data. The architecture was optimized for each city with a different number of convolutional filters: Bengaluru (32), Mumbai and Delhi (64), and Kolkata (128). The models achieved root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.21 mm/day (Bengaluru), 0.52 mm/day (Mumbai), 0.48 mm/day (Delhi), and 1.80 mm/day (Kolkata). Through interpretability analysis using permutation importance, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), temporal occlusion, and counterfactual perturbation, we identified distinct patterns in the model's behavior. The model relied on city-specific variables, with prediction horizons ranging from one day for Bengaluru to five days for Kolkata. This study demonstrates how explainable AI (xAI) can provide accurate forecasts and transparent insights into precipitation patterns in diverse urban environments.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效最小化Jeffreys散度，为概率分布学习提供了新的对称散度优化框架。

Abstract: Many tasks in machine learning can be described as or reduced to learning a probability distribution given a finite set of samples. A common approach is to minimize a statistical divergence between the (empirical) data distribution and a parameterized distribution, e.g., a normalizing flow (NF) or an energy-based model (EBM). In this context, the forward KL divergence is a ubiquitous due to its tractability, though its asymmetry may prevent capturing some properties of the target distribution. Symmetric alternatives involve brittle min-max formulations and adversarial training (e.g., generative adversarial networks) or evaluating the reverse KL divergence, as is the case for the symmetric Jeffreys divergence, which is challenging to compute from samples. This work sets out to develop a new approach to minimize the Jeffreys divergence. To do so, it uses a proxy model whose goal is not only to fit the data, but also to assist in optimizing the Jeffreys divergence of the main model. This joint training task is formulated as a constrained optimization problem to obtain a practical algorithm that adapts the models priorities throughout training. We illustrate how this framework can be used to combine the advantages of NFs and EBMs in tasks such as density estimation, image generation, and simulation-based inference.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical challenge of improving predictions of climate extreme events, specifically heat waves, using machine learning methods. Our work is framed as a classification problem in which we try to predict whether surface air temperature will exceed its q-th local quantile within a specified timeframe. Our key finding is that aggregating ensemble predictions using a power mean significantly enhances the classifier's performance. By making a machine-learning based weather forecasting model generative and applying this non-linear aggregation method, we achieve better accuracy in predicting extreme heat events than with the typical mean prediction from the same model. Our power aggregation method shows promise and adaptability, as its optimal performance varies with the quantile threshold chosen, demonstrating increased effectiveness for higher extremes prediction.

Conclusion: SKF方法统一了稀疏驱动和卡尔曼滤波框架，能够实时推断复杂时变非线性模型，简化了稀疏水平、方差参数和切换时刻的估计。

Abstract: Learning governing equations from data is central to understanding the behavior of physical systems across diverse scientific disciplines, including physics, biology, and engineering. The Sindy algorithm has proven effective in leveraging sparsity to identify concise models of nonlinear dynamical systems. In this paper, we extend sparsity-driven approaches to real-time learning by integrating a cornerstone algorithm from control theory -- the Kalman filter (KF). The resulting Sindy Kalman Filter (SKF) unifies both frameworks by treating unknown system parameters as state variables, enabling real-time inference of complex, time-varying nonlinear models unattainable by either method alone. Furthermore, SKF enhances KF parameter identification strategies, particularly via look-ahead error, significantly simplifying the estimation of sparsity levels, variance parameters, and switching instants. We validate SKF on a chaotic Lorenz system with drifting or switching parameters and demonstrate its effectiveness in the real-time identification of a sparse nonlinear aircraft model built from real flight data.

Conclusion: DGIMVCM方法能够有效解决不完整多视图聚类中的图构建和优化问题，展现出良好的性能

Abstract: The prevalence of real-world multi-view data makes incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC) a crucial research. The rapid development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has established them as one of the mainstream approaches for multi-view clustering. Despite significant progress in GNNs-based IMVC, some challenges remain: (1) Most methods rely on the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to construct static graphs from raw data, which introduces noise and diminishes the robustness of the graph topology. (2) Existing methods typically utilize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss between the reconstructed graph and the sparse adjacency graph directly as the graph reconstruction loss, leading to substantial gradient noise during optimization. To address these issues, we propose a novel \textbf{D}ynamic Deep \textbf{G}raph Learning for \textbf{I}ncomplete \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{V}iew \textbf{C}lustering with \textbf{M}asked Graph Reconstruction Loss (DGIMVCM). Firstly, we construct a missing-robust global graph from the raw data. A graph convolutional embedding layer is then designed to extract primary features and refined dynamic view-specific graph structures, leveraging the global graph for imputation of missing views. This process is complemented by graph structure contrastive learning, which identifies consistency among view-specific graph structures. Secondly, a graph self-attention encoder is introduced to extract high-level representations based on the imputed primary features and view-specific graphs, and is optimized with a masked graph reconstruction loss to mitigate gradient noise during optimization. Finally, a clustering module is constructed and optimized through a pseudo-label self-supervised training mechanism. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets validate the effectiveness and superiority of DGIMVCM.

TL;DR: LoRaCompass是一个基于强化学习的模型，用于在未知环境中高效定位LoRa标签，通过空间感知特征提取和策略蒸馏损失函数来应对领域偏移和信号波动，在超过80km²的多样化环境中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于强化学习的定位方法容易受到领域偏移和信号波动的影响，导致决策错误累积和定位不准确。需要开发一个能够在未知环境中稳健高效搜索LoRa标签的方法。

Method: 提出LoRaCompass模型，包含：1）空间感知特征提取器从RSSI学习稳健的空间表示；2）策略蒸馏损失函数最大化向标签靠近的概率；3）基于上置信界的探索函数引导传感器以递增置信度接近标签。

Result: 在超过80km²的多样化未知环境中验证，LoRaCompass在100米范围内定位成功率超过90%（比现有方法提升40%），搜索路径长度与初始距离呈线性比例关系，表现出高效率。

Conclusion: LoRaCompass能够有效应对领域偏移和信号波动，在未知环境中实现稳健高效的LoRa标签定位，为心智障碍人士等高风险人群的定位提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: The Long-Range (LoRa) protocol, known for its extensive range and low power, has increasingly been adopted in tags worn by mentally incapacitated persons (MIPs) and others at risk of going missing. We study the sequential decision-making process for a mobile sensor to locate a periodically broadcasting LoRa tag with the fewest moves (hops) in general, unknown environments, guided by the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). While existing methods leverage reinforcement learning for search, they remain vulnerable to domain shift and signal fluctuation, resulting in cascading decision errors that culminate in substantial localization inaccuracies. To bridge this gap, we propose LoRaCompass, a reinforcement learning model designed to achieve robust and efficient search for a LoRa tag. For exploitation under domain shift and signal fluctuation, LoRaCompass learns a robust spatial representation from RSSI to maximize the probability of moving closer to a tag, via a spatially-aware feature extractor and a policy distillation loss function. It further introduces an exploration function inspired by the upper confidence bound (UCB) that guides the sensor toward the tag with increasing confidence. We have validated LoRaCompass in ground-based and drone-assisted scenarios within diverse unseen environments covering an area of over 80km^2. It has demonstrated high success rate (>90%) in locating the tag within 100m proximity (a 40% improvement over existing methods) and high efficiency with a search path length (in hops) that scales linearly with the initial distance.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效节省计算资源，并支持快速超参数调整，为联邦学习提供了更高效的训练策略。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized devices while preserving data privacy. However, FL methods typically run for a predefined number of global rounds, often leading to unnecessary computation when optimal performance is reached earlier. In addition, training may continue even when the model fails to achieve meaningful performance. To address this inefficiency, we introduce a zero-shot synthetic validation framework that leverages generative AI to monitor model performance and determine early stopping points. Our approach adaptively stops training near the optimal round, thereby conserving computational resources and enabling rapid hyperparameter adjustments. Numerical results on multi-label chest X-ray classification demonstrate that our method reduces training rounds by up to 74% while maintaining accuracy within 1% of the optimal.

Abstract: Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) are versatile detectors that reconstruct charged-particle tracks in an ionizing medium, enabling sensitive measurements across a wide range of nuclear physics experiments. We explore sparse convolutional networks for representation learning on TPC data, finding that a sparse ResNet architecture, even with randomly set weights, provides useful structured vector embeddings of events. Pre-training this architecture on a simple physics-motivated binary classification task further improves the embedding quality. Using data from the GAseous Detector with GErmanium Tagging (GADGET) II TPC, a detector optimized for measuring low-energy $β$-delayed particle decays, we represent raw pad-level signals as sparse tensors, train Minkowski Engine ResNet models, and probe the resulting event-level embeddings which reveal rich event structure. As a cross-detector test, we embed data from the Active-Target TPC (AT-TPC) -- a detector designed for nuclear reaction studies in inverse kinematics -- using the same encoder. We find that even an untrained sparse ResNet model provides useful embeddings of AT-TPC data, and we observe improvements when the model is trained on GADGET data. Together, these results highlight the potential of sparse convolutional techniques as a general tool for representation learning in diverse TPC experiments.

This approach can be integrated with existing pattern-based authentication methods to create multi-layered security systems for mobile applications.

Motivation: 传统方法通过增加隐藏层大小来获得更宽的表征，但这会导致二次计算成本增长。VWN旨在获得宽表征的好处，同时避免这种计算开销。

Method: VWN框架解耦表示宽度和主干网络宽度，在保持主干计算几乎不变的情况下扩展嵌入空间。

Result: 8倍扩展使下一个token预测优化速度提高2倍以上，下两个token预测提高3倍。随着训练进行，损失差距增大且收敛速度比增加，显示VWN不仅token高效，而且随规模扩大效果更佳。

Conclusion: VWN发现虚拟宽度与损失减少之间存在近似对数线性缩放关系，为探索虚拟宽度缩放作为大模型效率新维度提供了实证基础。

Abstract: We introduce Virtual Width Networks (VWN), a framework that delivers the benefits of wider representations without incurring the quadratic cost of increasing the hidden size. VWN decouples representational width from backbone width, expanding the embedding space while keeping backbone compute nearly constant. In our large-scale experiment, an 8-times expansion accelerates optimization by over 2 times for next-token and 3 times for next-2-token prediction. The advantage amplifies over training as both the loss gap grows and the convergence-speedup ratio increases, showing that VWN is not only token-efficient but also increasingly effective with scale. Moreover, we identify an approximately log-linear scaling relation between virtual width and loss reduction, offering an initial empirical basis and motivation for exploring virtual-width scaling as a new dimension of large-model efficiency.

Conclusion: HealSplit为SFL提供了首个统一的端到端防御框架，能够有效检测和恢复多种复杂的投毒攻击，显著提升了SFL系统的安全性。

Abstract: Split Federated Learning (SFL) is an emerging paradigm for privacy-preserving distributed learning. However, it remains vulnerable to sophisticated data poisoning attacks targeting local features, labels, smashed data, and model weights. Existing defenses, primarily adapted from traditional Federated Learning (FL), are less effective under SFL due to limited access to complete model updates. This paper presents HealSplit, the first unified defense framework tailored for SFL, offering end-to-end detection and recovery against five sophisticated types of poisoning attacks. HealSplit comprises three key components: (1) a topology-aware detection module that constructs graphs over smashed data to identify poisoned samples via topological anomaly scoring (TAS); (2) a generative recovery pipeline that synthesizes semantically consistent substitutes for detected anomalies, validated by a consistency validation student; and (3) an adversarial multi-teacher distillation framework trains the student using semantic supervision from a Vanilla Teacher and anomaly-aware signals from an Anomaly-Influence Debiasing (AD) Teacher, guided by the alignment between topological and gradient-based interaction matrices. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that HealSplit consistently outperforms ten state-of-the-art defenses, achieving superior robustness and defense effectiveness across diverse attack scenarios.

Abstract: Attributed graphs, typically characterized by irregular topologies and a mix of numerical and categorical attributes, are ubiquitous in diverse domains such as social networks, bioinformatics, and cheminformatics. While graph kernels provide a principled framework for measuring graph similarity, existing kernel methods often struggle to simultaneously capture heterogeneous attribute semantics and neighborhood information in attributed graphs. In this work, we propose the Neighborhood-Aware Star Kernel (NASK), a novel graph kernel designed for attributed graph learning. NASK leverages an exponential transformation of the Gower similarity coefficient to jointly model numerical and categorical features efficiently, and employs star substructures enhanced by Weisfeiler-Lehman iterations to integrate multi-scale neighborhood structural information. We theoretically prove that NASK is positive definite, ensuring compatibility with kernel-based learning frameworks such as SVMs. Extensive experiments are conducted on eleven attributed and four large-scale real-world graph benchmarks. The results demonstrate that NASK consistently achieves superior performance over sixteen state-of-the-art baselines, including nine graph kernels and seven Graph Neural Networks.

TL;DR: 基于电子健康记录（EHR）的预测模型在识别癌症高风险人群方面显著优于传统风险因素，可实现3-6倍的真实癌症病例富集，展示了支持更精确和可扩展早期检测策略的临床潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前癌症筛查指南仅覆盖少数癌症类型，且依赖年龄或单一风险因素等狭窄标准来识别高风险个体。EHR记录的大规模纵向患者健康信息可能通过检测癌症的微妙前诊断信号，为识别高风险群体提供更有效的工具。

Method: 使用All of Us研究项目中865,000多名参与者的EHR、基因组和调查数据，系统评估了基于EHR的预测模型与包括基因突变和癌症家族史在内的传统风险因素在识别八种主要癌症高风险个体方面的临床效用。

Result: 即使使用基线建模方法，基于EHR的模型在识别为高风险个体中真实癌症病例的富集度比单独使用传统风险因素高3-6倍。EHR基础模型进一步提高了对26种癌症类型的预测性能。

Conclusion: 基于EHR的预测建模具有支持更精确和可扩展早期检测策略的临床潜力，其性能显著优于当前筛查指南中使用的传统风险因素。

Abstract: Current cancer screening guidelines cover only a few cancer types and rely on narrowly defined criteria such as age or a single risk factor like smoking history, to identify high-risk individuals. Predictive models using electronic health records (EHRs), which capture large-scale longitudinal patient-level health information, may provide a more effective tool for identifying high-risk groups by detecting subtle prediagnostic signals of cancer. Recent advances in large language and foundation models have further expanded this potential, yet evidence remains limited on how useful HER-based models are compared with traditional risk factors currently used in screening guidelines. We systematically evaluated the clinical utility of EHR-based predictive models against traditional risk factors, including gene mutations and family history of cancer, for identifying high-risk individuals across eight major cancers (breast, lung, colorectal, prostate, ovarian, liver, pancreatic, and stomach), using data from the All of Us Research Program, which integrates EHR, genomic, and survey data from over 865,000 participants. Even with a baseline modeling approach, EHR-based models achieved a 3- to 6-fold higher enrichment of true cancer cases among individuals identified as high risk compared with traditional risk factors alone, whether used as a standalone or complementary tool. The EHR foundation model, a state-of-the-art approach trained on comprehensive patient trajectories, further improved predictive performance across 26 cancer types, demonstrating the clinical potential of EHR-based predictive modeling to support more precise and scalable early detection strategies.

Conclusion: MTPC有效平衡表达力与延迟，通过探索不同参数化（如PC架构和部分层共享）实现最优权衡。

Abstract: Multi-token prediction (MTP) is a prominent strategy to significantly speed up generation in large language models (LLMs), including byte-level LLMs, which are tokeniser-free but prohibitively slow. However, existing MTP methods often sacrifice expressiveness by assuming independence between future tokens. In this work, we investigate the trade-off between expressiveness and latency in MTP within the framework of probabilistic circuits (PCs). Our framework, named MTPC, allows one to explore different ways to encode the joint distributions over future tokens by selecting different circuit architectures, generalising classical models such as (hierarchical) mixture models, hidden Markov models and tensor networks. We show the efficacy of MTPC by retrofitting existing byte-level LLMs, such as EvaByte. Our experiments show that, when combined with speculative decoding, MTPC significantly speeds up generation compared to MTP with independence assumptions, while guaranteeing to retain the performance of the original verifier LLM. We also rigorously study the optimal trade-off between expressiveness and latency when exploring the possible parameterisations of MTPC, such as PC architectures and partial layer sharing between the verifier and draft LLMs.

Abstract: Machine learning force fields (MLFFs), which employ neural networks to map atomic structures to system energies, effectively combine the high accuracy of first-principles calculation with the computational efficiency of empirical force fields. They are widely used in computational materials simulations. However, the development and application of MLFFs for lithium-ion battery cathode materials remain relatively limited. This is primarily due to the complex electronic structure characteristics of cathode materials and the resulting scarcity of high-quality computational datasets available for force field training. In this work, we develop a multi-fidelity machine learning force field framework to enhance the data efficiency of computational results, which can simultaneously utilize both low-fidelity non-magnetic and high-fidelity magnetic computational datasets of cathode materials for training. Tests conducted on the lithium manganese iron phosphate (LMFP) cathode material system demonstrate the effectiveness of this multi-fidelity approach. This work helps to achieve high-accuracy MLFF training for cathode materials at a lower training dataset cost, and offers new perspectives for applying MLFFs to computational simulations of cathode materials.

Motivation: 边缘AI系统需要在严格内存约束下支持不同任务的适应，传统反向传播训练需要存储层激活和优化器状态，限制了可部署的最大模型规模。

Method: 使用内存高效的零阶优化(MeZO)方法，仅通过前向评估估计梯度，无需存储中间激活或优化器状态。

Result: 理论分析和数值验证表明，在设备内存约束下，MeZO能够容纳更大的模型规模，并在有足够微调时间时展现出精度优势。

Conclusion: MeZO方法在边缘设备部署中具有显著优势，能够在内存限制下支持更大模型的微调，尽管需要更长的训练时间。

Abstract: On-device fine-tuning is a critical capability for edge AI systems, which must support adaptation to different agentic tasks under stringent memory constraints. Conventional backpropagation (BP)-based training requires storing layer activations and optimizer states, a demand that can be only partially alleviated through checkpointing. In edge deployments in which the model weights must reside entirely in device memory, this overhead severely limits the maximum model size that can be deployed. Memory-efficient zeroth-order optimization (MeZO) alleviates this bottleneck by estimating gradients using forward evaluations alone, eliminating the need for storing intermediate activations or optimizer states. This enables significantly larger models to fit within on-chip memory, albeit at the cost of potentially longer fine-tuning wall-clock time. This paper first provides a theoretical estimate of the relative model sizes that can be accommodated under BP and MeZO training. We then numerically validate the analysis, demonstrating that MeZO exhibits accuracy advantages under on-device memory constraints, provided sufficient wall-clock time is available for fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算方法将基因视为孤立数值特征，忽略了基因符号中丰富的生物学语义信息，这阻碍了对关键生物学特征的深入理解。

Method: 使用LLM将每个组织位点的基因集转换为生物学信息嵌入，与GNN捕捉的空间邻域关系融合，并引入细粒度语义调制模块进行特征校准。

Result: 在公共空间转录组数据集上的实验表明，SemST实现了最先进的聚类性能，FSM模块具有即插即用的通用性。

Conclusion: SemST成功整合了生物功能和空间结构，通过语义引导方法显著提升了空间转录组数据分析能力。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics enables gene expression profiling with spatial context, offering unprecedented insights into the tissue microenvironment. However, most computational models treat genes as isolated numerical features, ignoring the rich biological semantics encoded in their symbols. This prevents a truly deep understanding of critical biological characteristics. To overcome this limitation, we present SemST, a semantic-guided deep learning framework for spatial transcriptomics data clustering. SemST leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable genes to "speak" through their symbolic meanings, transforming gene sets within each tissue spot into biologically informed embeddings. These embeddings are then fused with the spatial neighborhood relationships captured by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), achieving a coherent integration of biological function and spatial structure. We further introduce the Fine-grained Semantic Modulation (FSM) module to optimally exploit these biological priors. The FSM module learns spot-specific affine transformations that empower the semantic embeddings to perform an element-wise calibration of the spatial features, thus dynamically injecting high-order biological knowledge into the spatial context. Extensive experiments on public spatial transcriptomics datasets show that SemST achieves state-of-the-art clustering performance. Crucially, the FSM module exhibits plug-and-play versatility, consistently improving the performance when integrated into other baseline methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一个具有严格物理保证的谱归一化代理模型，用于正向和逆向力学均匀化。通过Voigt-Reuss边界，学习一个特征值在[0,1]范围内的对称半正定表示，确保预测结果在Löwner意义下位于边界之间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够同时进行准确正向预测和约束一致的逆向设计的统一框架，确保物理可接受性，并适用于椭圆算子和耦合物理设置。

Method: 利用Voigt-Reuss边界，通过Cholesky类算子分解其差异，学习无量纲的对称半正定表示。在3D线性弹性中使用全连接Voigt-Reuss网络，在2D平面应变中结合谱归一化、可微分渲染器和CNN。

Result: 在3D线性弹性中，各向同性投影恢复接近完美保真度（R²≥0.998），张量级相对Frobenius误差中值≈1.7%，均值≈3.4%。在2D平面应变中，所有分量的R²>0.99，亚百分比归一化损失，准确跟踪渗透诱导的特征值跳跃。

Conclusion: Voigt-Reuss网络统一了准确、物理可接受的正向预测与大批量、约束一致的逆向设计，对椭圆算子和耦合物理设置具有通用性。

Abstract: We propose a spectrally normalized surrogate for forward and inverse mechanical homogenization with hard physical guarantees. Leveraging the Voigt-Reuss bounds, we factor their difference via a Cholesky-like operator and learn a dimensionless, symmetric positive semi-definite representation with eigenvalues in $[0,1]$; the inverse map returns symmetric positive-definite predictions that lie between the bounds in the Löwner sense. In 3D linear elasticity on an open dataset of stochastic biphasic microstructures, a fully connected Voigt-Reuss net trained on $>\!7.5\times 10^{5}$ FFT-based labels with 236 isotropy-invariant descriptors and three contrast parameters recovers the isotropic projection with near-perfect fidelity (isotropy-related entries: $R^2 \ge 0.998$), while anisotropy-revealing couplings are unidentifiable from $SO(3)$-invariant inputs. Tensor-level relative Frobenius errors have median $\approx 1.7\%$ and mean $\approx 3.4\%$ across splits. For 2D plane strain on thresholded trigonometric microstructures, coupling spectral normalization with a differentiable renderer and a CNN yields $R^2>0.99$ on all components, subpercent normalized losses, accurate tracking of percolation-induced eigenvalue jumps, and robust generalization to out-of-distribution images. Treating the parametric microstructure as design variables, batched first-order optimization with a single surrogate matches target tensors within a few percent and returns diverse near-optimal designs. Overall, the Voigt-Reuss net unifies accurate, physically admissible forward prediction with large-batch, constraint-consistent inverse design, and is generic to elliptic operators and coupled-physics settings.

Abstract: Phase-time arrays, which integrate phase shifters (PSs) and true-time delays (TTDs), have emerged as a cost-effective architecture for generating frequency-dependent rainbow beams in wideband sensing and localization. This paper proposes an end-to-end deep learning-based scheme that simultaneously designs the rainbow beams and estimates user positions. Treating the PS and TTD coefficients as trainable variables allows the network to synthesize task-oriented beams that maximize localization accuracy. A lightweight fully connected module then recovers the user's angle-range coordinates from its feedback of the maximum quantized received power and its corresponding subcarrier index after a single downlink transmission. Compared with existing analytical and learning-based schemes, the proposed method reduces overhead by an order of magnitude and delivers consistently lower two-dimensional positioning error.

Abstract: Autonomous spacecraft control for mission phases such as launch, ascent, stage separation, and orbit insertion remains a critical challenge due to the need for adaptive policies that generalize across dynamically distinct regimes. While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in individual astrodynamics tasks, existing approaches often require separate policies for distinct mission phases, limiting adaptability and increasing operational complexity. This work introduces a transformer-based RL framework that unifies multi-phase trajectory optimization through a single policy architecture, leveraging the transformer's inherent capacity to model extended temporal contexts. Building on proximal policy optimization (PPO), our framework replaces conventional recurrent networks with a transformer encoder-decoder structure, enabling the agent to maintain coherent memory across mission phases spanning seconds to minutes during critical operations. By integrating a Gated Transformer-XL (GTrXL) architecture, the framework eliminates manual phase transitions while maintaining stability in control decisions. We validate our approach progressively: first demonstrating near-optimal performance on single-phase benchmarks (double integrator and Van der Pol oscillator), then extending to multiphase waypoint navigation variants, and finally tackling a complex multiphase rocket ascent problem that includes atmospheric flight, stage separation, and vacuum operations. Results demonstrate that the transformer-based framework not only matches analytical solutions in simple cases but also effectively learns coherent control policies across dynamically distinct regimes, establishing a foundation for scalable autonomous mission planning that reduces reliance on phase-specific controllers while maintaining compatibility with safety-critical verification protocols.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在加权图的最佳匹配问题中，通常使用预测器来估计边的随机权重。虽然贝叶斯最优预测器能提供最优匹配，但现实中预测器往往不完美。不完美预测器可能导致标准最优决策规则表现不佳，需要寻找能够补偿预测误差的决策方法。

Result: 证明了构造的多校准预测器γ̂能够确保基于其输出的匹配决策与在原始预测器上应用的最佳决策规则具有竞争力，并提供了样本复杂度界限来补充这一结果。

Conclusion: 多校准方法为解决不完美预测器下的加权图匹配问题提供了有效途径，通过构造多校准预测器可以补偿预测误差，提升匹配决策的质量，并与理论上的最佳决策规则保持竞争力。

Abstract: Consider the problem of finding the best matching in a weighted graph where we only have access to predictions of the actual stochastic weights, based on an underlying context. If the predictor is the Bayes optimal one, then computing the best matching based on the predicted weights is optimal. However, in practice, this perfect information scenario is not realistic. Given an imperfect predictor, a suboptimal decision rule may compensate for the induced error and thus outperform the standard optimal rule.
  In this paper, we propose multicalibration as a way to address this problem. This fairness notion requires a predictor to be unbiased on each element of a family of protected sets of contexts. Given a class of matching algorithms $\mathcal C$ and any predictor $γ$ of the edge-weights, we show how to construct a specific multicalibrated predictor $\hat γ$, with the following property. Picking the best matching based on the output of $\hat γ$ is competitive with the best decision rule in $\mathcal C$ applied onto the original predictor $γ$. We complement this result by providing sample complexity bounds.

Abstract: We demonstrate a practical differentiable programming approach for acoustic inverse problems through two applications: admittance estimation and shape optimization for resonance damping. First, we show that JAX-FEM's automatic differentiation (AD) enables direct gradient-based estimation of complex boundary admittance from sparse pressure measurements, achieving 3-digit precision without requiring manual derivation of adjoint equations. Second, we apply randomized finite differences to acoustic shape optimization, combining JAX-FEM for forward simulation with PyTorch3D for mesh manipulation through AD. By separating physics-driven boundary optimization from geometry-driven interior mesh adaptation, we achieve 48.1% energy reduction at target frequencies with 30-fold fewer FEM solutions compared to standard finite difference on the full mesh. This work showcases how modern differentiable software stacks enable rapid prototyping of optimization workflows for physics-based inverse problems, with automatic differentiation for parameter estimation and a combination of finite differences and AD for geometric design.

Conclusion: OT量化是一种有原则且有效的方法，可用于压缩FM生成模型，适用于边缘和嵌入式AI应用。

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) generative models offer efficient simulation-free training and deterministic sampling, but their practical deployment is challenged by high-precision parameter requirements. We adapt optimal transport (OT)-based post-training quantization to FM models, minimizing the 2-Wasserstein distance between quantized and original weights, and systematically compare its effectiveness against uniform, piecewise, and logarithmic quantization schemes. Our theoretical analysis provides upper bounds on generative degradation under quantization, and empirical results across five benchmark datasets of varying complexity show that OT-based quantization preserves both visual generation quality and latent space stability down to 2-3 bits per parameter, where alternative methods fail. This establishes OT-based quantization as a principled, effective approach to compress FM generative models for edge and embedded AI applications.

Conclusion: RETROFIT在无需历史数据的情况下有效缓解遗忘，同时保持适应性，在安全分析任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Modern security analytics are increasingly powered by deep learning models, but their performance often degrades as threat landscapes evolve and data representations shift. While continual learning (CL) offers a promising paradigm to maintain model effectiveness, many approaches rely on full retraining or data replay, which are infeasible in data-sensitive environments. Moreover, existing methods remain inadequate for security-critical scenarios, facing two coupled challenges in knowledge transfer: preserving prior knowledge without old data and integrating new knowledge with minimal interference.
  We propose RETROFIT, a data retrospective-free continual learning method that achieves bounded forgetting for effective knowledge transfer. Our key idea is to consolidate previously trained and newly fine-tuned models, serving as teachers of old and new knowledge, through parameter-level merging that eliminates the need for historical data. To mitigate interference, we apply low-rank and sparse updates that confine parameter changes to independent subspaces, while a knowledge arbitration dynamically balances the teacher contributions guided by model confidence. Our evaluation on two representative applications demonstrates that RETROFIT consistently mitigates forgetting while maintaining adaptability. In malware detection under temporal drift, it substantially improves the retention score, from 20.2% to 38.6% over CL baselines, and exceeds the oracle upper bound on new data. In binary summarization across decompilation levels, where analyzing stripped binaries is especially challenging, RETROFIT achieves around twice the BLEU score of transfer learning used in prior work and surpasses all baselines in cross-representation generalization.

Abstract: Diffusion models produce high quality images but inference is costly due to many denoising steps and heavy matrix operations. We present DiffPro, a post-training, hardware-faithful framework that works with the exact integer kernels used in deployment and jointly tunes timesteps and per-layer precision in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) to reduce latency and memory without any training. DiffPro combines three parts: a manifold-aware sensitivity metric to allocate weight bits, dynamic activation quantization to stabilize activations across timesteps, and a budgeted timestep selector guided by teacher-student drift. In experiments DiffPro achieves up to 6.25x model compression, fifty percent fewer timesteps, and 2.8x faster inference with Delta FID <= 10 on standard benchmarks, demonstrating practical efficiency gains. DiffPro unifies step reduction and precision planning into a single budgeted deployable plan for real-time energy-aware diffusion inference.

Despite extensive research on emerging fairness-aware AI software, up to now most efforts to solve this issue have been dedicated to binary classification tasks. Fairness in regression is relatively underexplored. In this work, we adopted a mutual information-based metric to assess separation violations. The metric is also extended so that it can be directly applied to both classification and regression problems with both binary and continuous sensitive attributes. Inspired by the Reweighing algorithm in fair classification, we proposed a FairReweighing pre-processing algorithm based on density estimation to ensure that the learned model satisfies the separation criterion. Theoretically, we show that the proposed FairReweighing algorithm can guarantee separation in the training data under a data independence assumption. Empirically, on both synthetic and real-world data, we show that FairReweighing outperforms existing state-of-the-art regression fairness solutions in terms of improving separation while maintaining high accuracy.

*Riku Green,Huw Day,Zahraa S. Abdallah,Telmo M. Silva Filho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了多步预测中递归策略和直接策略的传统偏见-方差权衡观点，通过理论分析和实验证明，对于非线性模型，递归策略可能同时具有更低的偏差和更高的方差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为递归策略具有高偏差低方差，直接策略具有低偏差高方差。本文旨在重新审视这一观点，通过理论分解来理解多步预测误差的来源。

Method: 将多步预测误差分解为不可约噪声、结构近似差距和估计方差三个部分。对于线性预测器，证明结构差距为零；对于非线性预测器，分析递归组合如何影响模型表达能力。

Result: 实验使用多层感知器在ETTm1数据集上验证了理论发现，表明递归策略可能同时具有更低的偏差和更高的方差，这取决于模型的非线性程度和噪声特性。

Conclusion: 提供了基于模型非线性和噪声特性的实用指导，而不是依赖传统的偏见-方差直觉来选择递归和直接策略。

Abstract: Multi-step forecasting is often described through a simple rule of thumb: recursive strategies are said to have high bias and low variance, while direct strategies are said to have low bias and high variance. We revisit this belief by decomposing the expected multi-step forecast error into three parts: irreducible noise, a structural approximation gap, and an estimation-variance term. For linear predictors we show that the structural gap is identically zero for any dataset. For nonlinear predictors, however, the repeated composition used in recursion can increase model expressivity, making the structural gap depend on both the model and the data. We further show that the estimation variance of the recursive strategy at any horizon can be written as the one-step variance multiplied by a Jacobian-based amplification factor that measures how sensitive the composed predictor is to parameter error. This perspective explains when recursive forecasting may simultaneously have lower bias and higher variance than direct forecasting. Experiments with multilayer perceptrons on the ETTm1 dataset confirm these findings. The results offer practical guidance for choosing between recursive and direct strategies based on model nonlinearity and noise characteristics, rather than relying on traditional bias-variance intuition.

Motivation: 解决雷达数据稀缺问题，利用更丰富的MoCap数据来增强雷达数据集，同时比基于物理的方法计算量更小。

Method: 将MoCap到频谱图转换建模为窗口化序列到序列任务，使用Transformer模型联合捕捉MoCap标记之间的空间关系和跨帧的时间动态。

Result: 实验表明该方法能生成视觉和定量上合理的多普勒雷达频谱图，具有良好的泛化能力，模型能够将多部位运动转换为多普勒特征并理解人体不同部位的空间关系。

Conclusion: 这是使用Transformer进行时间序列信号处理的有趣示例，特别适用于边缘计算和物联网雷达，能够用更丰富的MoCap数据增强稀缺的雷达数据集，且计算量远小于基于物理的方法。

Abstract: We present a pure machine learning process for synthesizing radar spectrograms from Motion-Capture (MoCap) data. We formulate MoCap-to-spectrogram translation as a windowed sequence-to-sequence task using a transformer-based model that jointly captures spatial relations among MoCap markers and temporal dynamics across frames. Real-world experiments show that the proposed approach produces visually and quantitatively plausible doppler radar spectrograms and achieves good generalizability. Ablation experiments show that the learned model includes both the ability to convert multi-part motion into doppler signatures and an understanding of the spatial relations between different parts of the human body.
  The result is an interesting example of using transformers for time-series signal processing. It is especially applicable to edge computing and Internet of Things (IoT) radars. It also suggests the ability to augment scarce radar datasets using more abundant MoCap data for training higher-level applications. Finally, it requires far less computation than physics-based methods for generating radar data.

Conclusion: 提出的分箱方法和评估指标能够更准确地评估预测集的适应性，同时新的自适应预测集算法在多个任务上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Conformal prediction constructs a set of labels instead of a single point prediction, while providing a probabilistic coverage guarantee. Beyond the coverage guarantee, adaptiveness to example difficulty is an important property. It means that the method should produce larger prediction sets for more difficult examples, and smaller ones for easier examples. Existing evaluation methods for adaptiveness typically analyze coverage rate violation or average set size across bins of examples grouped by difficulty. However, these approaches often suffer from imbalanced binning, which can lead to inaccurate estimates of coverage or set size. To address this issue, we propose a binning method that leverages input transformations to sort examples by difficulty, followed by uniform-mass binning. Building on this binning, we introduce two metrics to better evaluate adaptiveness. These metrics provide more reliable estimates of coverage rate violation and average set size due to balanced binning, leading to more accurate adaptivity assessment. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed metric correlates more strongly with the desired adaptiveness property compared to existing ones. Furthermore, motivated by our findings, we propose a new adaptive prediction set algorithm that groups examples by estimated difficulty and applies group-conditional conformal prediction. This allows us to determine appropriate thresholds for each group. Experimental results on both (a) an Image Classification (ImageNet) (b) a medical task (visual acuity prediction) show that our method outperforms existing approaches according to the new metrics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反应堆压力容器钢中碳化物对力学性能至关重要，但扫描电镜图像中碳化物与基体的灰度值重叠使简单阈值分割无效，需要更精确的分割方法。

Method: 使用轻量级U-Net架构（3070万参数），仅需10张标注的扫描电镜图像进行训练，实现数据高效分割。

Result: 模型在有限数据下达到Dice-Sørensen系数0.98，显著优于传统图像分析方法（0.85），同时将标注工作量减少一个数量级。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了快速自动化的碳化物定量分析，可推广到其他钢种，展示了数据高效深度学习在反应堆压力容器钢分析中的潜力。

Abstract: Understanding reactor-pressure-vessel steel microstructure is crucial for predicting mechanical properties, as carbide precipitates both strengthen the alloy and can initiate cracks. In scanning electron microscopy images, gray-value overlap between carbides and matrix makes simple thresholding ineffective. We present a data-efficient segmentation pipeline using a lightweight U-Net (30.7~M parameters) trained on just \textbf{10 annotated scanning electron microscopy images}. Despite limited data, our model achieves a \textbf{Dice-Sørensen coefficient of 0.98}, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art in the field of metallurgy (classical image analysis: 0.85), while reducing annotation effort by one order of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art data efficient segmentation model. This approach enables rapid, automated carbide quantification for alloy design and generalizes to other steel types, demonstrating the potential of data-efficient deep learning in reactor-pressure-vessel steel analysis.

Motivation: 研究RGZ数据集的固有维度特性，探索iD与能量分数、形态类别和信噪比之间的关系，为自监督学习算法提供定量分析基础。

Method: 采用基于分数的扩散模型估计RGZ数据集的固有维度，使用贝叶斯神经网络能量分数衡量与MiraBest子集的相似性，分析iD与FR形态类别和SNR的关系。

Result: 分布外源具有更高iD值，RGZ整体iD高于自然图像数据集；FR I和FR II类之间无iD关系，但存在弱趋势显示较低iD对应较高SNR。

Conclusion: iD与能量分数的关系可用于定量研究和改进自监督学习算法在RGZ数据集上的表示学习效果。

Abstract: In this work, we estimate the intrinsic dimension (iD) of the Radio Galaxy Zoo (RGZ) dataset using a score-based diffusion model. We examine how the iD estimates vary as a function of Bayesian neural network (BNN) energy scores, which measure how similar the radio sources are to the MiraBest subset of the RGZ dataset. We find that out-of-distribution sources exhibit higher iD values, and that the overall iD for RGZ exceeds those typically reported for natural image datasets. Furthermore, we analyse how iD varies across Fanaroff-Riley (FR) morphological classes and as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). While no relationship is found between FR I and FR II classes, a weak trend toward higher SNR at lower iD. Future work using the RGZ dataset could make use of the relationship between iD and energy scores to quantitatively study and improve the representations learned by various self-supervised learning algorithms.

TL;DR: 论文提出强化犹豫(RH)方法，通过三元奖励系统(+1正确，0弃权，-λ错误)训练模型学会在不确定时弃权，并引入级联推理策略来利用弃权信号进行协调，显著提升了模型的可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代语言模型缺乏可信智能的基本要求：知道何时不回答。即使面临严重后果，这些模型仍会产生自信的幻觉回答，因为训练过程奖励任何回答而非弃权。

Method: 提出强化犹豫(RH)方法，修改RLVR使用三元奖励系统；引入级联推理和自级联推理策略，利用训练得到的弃权信号进行模型协调。

Result: 在GSM8K、MedQA和GPQA上的评估显示，前沿模型几乎从不弃权；RH方法通过调整λ参数可在Pareto前沿上产生不同风险偏好的模型；级联推理策略以更低计算成本优于多数投票。

Conclusion: 将弃权作为首要训练目标，使"我不知道"从失败转变为协调信号，让模型通过对其局限性的校准诚实来赢得信任。

Abstract: Modern language models fail a fundamental requirement of trustworthy intelligence: knowing when not to answer. Despite achieving impressive accuracy on benchmarks, these models produce confident hallucinations, even when wrong answers carry catastrophic consequences. Our evaluations on GSM8K, MedQA and GPQA show frontier models almost never abstain despite explicit warnings of severe penalties, suggesting that prompts cannot override training that rewards any answer over no answer. As a remedy, we propose Reinforced Hesitation (RH): a modification to Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to use ternary rewards (+1 correct, 0 abstention, -$λ$ error) instead of binary. Controlled experiments on logic puzzles reveal that varying $λ$ produces distinct models along a Pareto frontier, where each training penalty yields the optimal model for its corresponding risk regime: low penalties produce aggressive answerers, high penalties conservative abstainers. We then introduce two inference strategies that exploit trained abstention as a coordination signal: cascading routes queries through models with decreasing risk tolerance, while self-cascading re-queries the same model on abstention. Both outperform majority voting with lower computational cost. These results establish abstention as a first-class training objective that transforms ``I don't know'' from failure into a coordination signal, enabling models to earn trust through calibrated honesty about their limits.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在分布式环境中运行MoE模型时，阻塞通信是主要效率瓶颈，需要解决计算与通信的重叠问题。

Method: 修改现代模型架构，跳过模型中的连接，并通过自蒸馏等技术转换大型模型，实现通信与计算的重叠。

Result: 成功转换了16B到109B参数的一系列最先进模型，在Llama 4 Scout（109B）上通过自蒸馏实现准确率与原始开源版本相差不到1%，同时通过优化实现显著加速。

Conclusion: FarSkip-Collective方法能够在不损失模型能力的情况下，有效解决MoE模型在分布式环境中的通信阻塞问题，提升训练和推理效率。

Abstract: Blocking communication presents a major hurdle in running MoEs efficiently in distributed settings. To address this, we present FarSkip-Collective which modifies the architecture of modern models to enable overlapping of their computation with communication. Our approach modifies the architecture to skip connections in the model and it is unclear a priori whether the modified model architecture can remain as capable, especially for large state-of-the-art models and while modifying all of the model layers. We answer this question in the affirmative and fully convert a series of state-of-the-art models varying from 16B to 109B parameters to enable overlapping of their communication while achieving accuracy on par with their original open-source releases. For example, we convert Llama 4 Scout (109B) via self-distillation and achieve average accuracy within 1% of its instruction tuned release averaged across a wide range of downstream evaluations. In addition to demonstrating retained accuracy of the large modified models, we realize the benefits of FarSkip-Collective through optimized implementations that explicitly overlap communication with computation, accelerating both training and inference in existing frameworks.

Motivation: 传统聚类方法经常无法为具有多个受保护属性的边缘化群体提供公平表示，这主要是由训练数据中的偏见造成的。现有研究仅限于两个群体的情况，而实际应用中数据点通常具有多个受保护属性。

Conclusion: 本文解决了Chakraborty等人提出的开放性问题，为多群体公平聚类提供了有效的近似算法，并进一步改进了公平相关聚类和公平共识聚类问题的近似保证。

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental task in machine learning and data analysis, but it frequently fails to provide fair representation for various marginalized communities defined by multiple protected attributes -- a shortcoming often caused by biases in the training data. As a result, there is a growing need to enhance the fairness of clustering outcomes, ideally by making minimal modifications, possibly as a post-processing step after conventional clustering. Recently, Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25] initiated the study of \emph{closest fair clustering}, though in a restricted scenario where data points belong to only two groups. In practice, however, data points are typically characterized by many groups, reflecting diverse protected attributes such as age, ethnicity, gender, etc.
  In this work, we generalize the study of the \emph{closest fair clustering} problem to settings with an arbitrary number (more than two) of groups. We begin by showing that the problem is NP-hard even when all groups are of equal size -- a stark contrast with the two-group case, for which an exact algorithm exists. Next, we propose near-linear time approximation algorithms that efficiently handle arbitrary-sized multiple groups, thereby answering an open question posed by Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25].
  Leveraging our closest fair clustering algorithms, we further achieve improved approximation guarantees for the \emph{fair correlation clustering} problem, advancing the state-of-the-art results established by Ahmadian et al. [AISTATS'20] and Ahmadi et al. [2020]. Additionally, we are the first to provide approximation algorithms for the \emph{fair consensus clustering} problem involving multiple (more than two) groups, thus addressing another open direction highlighted by Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25].

Method: 将自注意力动力学建模为连续时间多智能体系统，分析其与Oja流的关系，并对平衡点进行分类和稳定性分析。

Result: 发现自注意力动力学中存在四类平衡点，其中共识和二分共识平衡点总是与价值矩阵的特征向量对齐，且前三类平衡点经常共存并具有渐近稳定性。

Conclusion: 自注意力动力学与Oja流密切相关，其平衡点结构揭示了transformer注意力机制的内在特性，特别是与价值矩阵特征向量的对齐关系。

Abstract: In machine learning, a self-attention dynamics is a continuous-time multiagent-like model of the attention mechanisms of transformers. In this paper we show that such dynamics is related to a multiagent version of the Oja flow, a dynamical system that computes the principal eigenvector of a matrix corresponding for transformers to the value matrix. We classify the equilibria of the ``single-head'' self-attention system into four classes: consensus, bipartite consensus, clustering and polygonal equilibria. Multiple asymptotically stable equilibria from the first three classes often coexist in the self-attention dynamics. Interestingly, equilibria from the first two classes are always aligned with the eigenvectors of the value matrix, often but not exclusively with the principal eigenvector.

Conclusion: 研究结果为实际半去中心化联邦学习部署提供了具体的设计指导，帮助根据数据异构性选择最优的服务器通信策略。

Abstract: In semi-decentralized federated learning, devices primarily rely on device-to-device communication but occasionally interact with a central server. Periodically, a sampled subset of devices uploads their local models to the server, which computes an aggregate model. The server can then either (i) share this aggregate model only with the sampled clients (sampled-to-sampled, S2S) or (ii) broadcast it to all clients (sampled-to-all, S2A). Despite their practical significance, a rigorous theoretical and empirical comparison of these two strategies remains absent. We address this gap by analyzing S2S and S2A within a unified convergence framework that accounts for key system parameters: sampling rate, server aggregation frequency, and network connectivity. Our results, both analytical and experimental, reveal distinct regimes where one strategy outperforms the other, depending primarily on the degree of data heterogeneity across devices. These insights lead to concrete design guidelines for practical semi-decentralized FL deployments.

Abstract: Mixture of Block Attention (MoBA) (Lu et al., 2025) is a promising building block for efficiently processing long contexts in LLMs by enabling queries to sparsely attend to a small subset of key-value blocks, drastically reducing computational cost. However, the design principles governing MoBA's performance are poorly understood, and it lacks an efficient GPU implementation, hindering its practical adoption. In this paper, we first develop a statistical model to analyze MoBA's underlying mechanics. Our model reveals that performance critically depends on the router's ability to accurately distinguish relevant from irrelevant blocks based on query-key affinities. We derive a signal-to-noise ratio that formally connects architectural parameters to this retrieval accuracy. Guided by our analysis, we identify two key pathways for improvement: using smaller block sizes and applying a short convolution on keys to cluster relevant signals, which enhances routing accuracy. While theoretically better, small block sizes are inefficient on GPUs. To bridge this gap, we introduce FlashMoBA, a hardware-aware CUDA kernel that enables efficient MoBA execution even with the small block sizes our theory recommends. We validate our insights by training LLMs from scratch, showing that our improved MoBA models match the performance of dense attention baselines. FlashMoBA achieves up to 14.7x speedup over FlashAttention-2 for small blocks, making our theoretically-grounded improvements practical.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了人工智能伦理熵的第二定律，类似于热力学第二定律，表明未经约束的AI会自发偏离目标，需要持续的对齐工作来维持稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统变得越来越自主和强大，确保它们持续符合人类意图变得至关重要。作者旨在为AI对齐问题建立一个类似热力学的定量理论框架。

Method: 定义了基于目标概率分布的伦理熵S = -Σ p(g_i; theta) ln p(g_i; theta)，并证明其时间导数dS/dt ≥ 0。推导了对齐工作的临界稳定性边界gamma_crit = (lambda_max / 2) ln N，其中lambda_max是Fisher信息矩阵的主特征值，N是模型参数数量。通过模拟验证理论。

Result: 70亿参数模型(N = 7×10^9)的伦理熵从初始0.32增加到1.69±1.08 nats，而使用对齐工作gamma = 20.4(1.5倍临界值)的系统保持稳定在0.00±0.00 nats(p = 4.19×10^-17, n = 20次试验)。

Conclusion: 该框架将AI对齐重新定义为连续热力学控制问题，为维护先进自主系统的稳定性和安全性提供了定量基础。

Abstract: We propose that unconstrained artificial intelligence obeys a Second Law analogous to thermodynamics, where ethical entropy, defined as a measure of divergence from intended goals, increases spontaneously without continuous alignment work. For gradient-based optimizers, we define this entropy over a finite set of goals {g_i} as S = -Σ p(g_i; theta) ln p(g_i; theta), and we prove that its time derivative dS/dt >= 0, driven by exploration noise and specification gaming. We derive the critical stability boundary for alignment work as gamma_crit = (lambda_max / 2) ln N, where lambda_max is the dominant eigenvalue of the Fisher Information Matrix and N is the number of model parameters. Simulations validate this theory. A 7-billion-parameter model (N = 7 x 10^9) with lambda_max = 1.2 drifts from an initial entropy of 0.32 to 1.69 +/- 1.08 nats, while a system regularized with alignment work gamma = 20.4 (1.5 gamma_crit) maintains stability at 0.00 +/- 0.00 nats (p = 4.19 x 10^-17, n = 20 trials). This framework recasts AI alignment as a problem of continuous thermodynamic control, providing a quantitative foundation for maintaining the stability and safety of advanced autonomous systems.

Motivation: 解决当前GUI智能体方法存在的两个根本限制：(1) 跨模型协同利用不足，(2) 过度依赖合成数据生成而利用不足。

Method: 提出Co-EPG自迭代训练框架，建立规划和接地模型的协同进化循环：规划模型在接地奖励指导下通过GRPO探索策略，生成多样化数据优化接地模型；优化的接地模型为后续规划模型训练提供更有效奖励。

Conclusion: 为GUI智能体建立了新的训练范式，从孤立优化转向集成、自驱动的协同进化方法。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) task automation constitutes a critical frontier in artificial intelligence research. While effective GUI agents synergistically integrate planning and grounding capabilities, current methodologies exhibit two fundamental limitations: (1) insufficient exploitation of cross-model synergies, and (2) over-reliance on synthetic data generation without sufficient utilization. To address these challenges, we propose Co-EPG, a self-iterative training framework for Co-Evolution of Planning and Grounding. Co-EPG establishes an iterative positive feedback loop: through this loop, the planning model explores superior strategies under grounding-based reward guidance via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), generating diverse data to optimize the grounding model. Concurrently, the optimized Grounding model provides more effective rewards for subsequent GRPO training of the planning model, fostering continuous improvement. Co-EPG thus enables iterative enhancement of agent capabilities through self-play optimization and training data distillation. On the Multimodal-Mind2Web and AndroidControl benchmarks, our framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods after just three iterations without requiring external data. The agent consistently improves with each iteration, demonstrating robust self-enhancement capabilities. This work establishes a novel training paradigm for GUI agents, shifting from isolated optimization to an integrated, self-driven co-evolution approach.

Result: 发现现有质量度量存在反直觉行为，提出的directed coverage度量在多种设置下表现具有竞争力甚至更优，确定了质量度量优化问题的可处理与难处理边界。

Conclusion: 质量度量的选择对所选解集特性有决定性影响，新提出的directed coverage度量在多种场景下表现良好，为多目标决策提供了更有效的代表性解集选择方法。

Abstract: Many real-world decision-making problems involve optimizing multiple objectives simultaneously, rendering the selection of the most preferred solution a non-trivial problem: All Pareto optimal solutions are viable candidates, and it is typically up to a decision maker to select one for implementation based on their subjective preferences. To reduce the cognitive load on the decision maker, previous work has introduced the Pareto pruning problem, where the goal is to compute a fixed-size subset of Pareto optimal solutions that best represent the full set, as evaluated by a given quality measure. Reframing Pareto pruning as a multiwinner voting problem, we conduct an axiomatic analysis of existing quality measures, uncovering several unintuitive behaviors. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a new measure, directed coverage. We also analyze the computational complexity of optimizing various quality measures, identifying previously unknown boundaries between tractable and intractable cases depending on the number and structure of the objectives. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation, demonstrating that the choice of quality measure has a decisive impact on the characteristics of the selected set of solutions and that our proposed measure performs competitively or even favorably across a range of settings.

### [294] [Structure-Aware Encodings of Argumentation Properties for Clique-width](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10767)
*Yasir Mahmood,Markus Hecher,Johanna Groven,Johannes K. Fichte*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了如何将抽象论证问题编码为(Q)SAT问题，并设计了一种能线性保持团宽度的有向分解引导(DDG)归约方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图的结构度量（如树宽）在计算复杂性中很重要，但团宽度作为更一般的参数，对稠密图也能保持较小值。目前对团宽度的编码能力了解甚少，而抽象论证框架是研究计算性质的理想候选。

Method: 设计了从论证问题到(Q)SAT的新归约方法，这些归约能线性保持团宽度，称为有向分解引导(DDG)归约。

Result: 为所有论证语义（包括计数）建立了新结果，证明了DDG归约的开销在合理假设下无法显著改进。

Conclusion: 这项工作开启了理解团宽度编码能力的研究，为抽象论证问题提供了高效的(Q)SAT编码方法。

Abstract: Structural measures of graphs, such as treewidth, are central tools in computational complexity resulting in efficient algorithms when exploiting the parameter. It is even known that modern SAT solvers work efficiently on instances of small treewidth. Since these solvers are widely applied, research interests in compact encodings into (Q)SAT for solving and to understand encoding limitations. Even more general is the graph parameter clique-width, which unlike treewidth can be small for dense graphs. Although algorithms are available for clique-width, little is known about encodings. We initiate the quest to understand encoding capabilities with clique-width by considering abstract argumentation, which is a robust framework for reasoning with conflicting arguments. It is based on directed graphs and asks for computationally challenging properties, making it a natural candidate to study computational properties. We design novel reductions from argumentation problems to (Q)SAT. Our reductions linearly preserve the clique-width, resulting in directed decomposition-guided (DDG) reductions. We establish novel results for all argumentation semantics, including counting. Notably, the overhead caused by our DDG reductions cannot be significantly improved under reasonable assumptions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了多智能体卧底游戏(MUG)协议来解决大语言模型中的幻觉问题，通过反事实测试检测幻觉智能体，提升多模态推理的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多智能体辩论(MAD)方法假设所有辩论者都是理性的，但实际中智能体本身可能产生幻觉，需要更可靠的检测机制。

Method: 基于社交推理游戏设计MUG协议，通过修改参考图像引入反事实证据，观察智能体是否能准确识别变化，从而检测幻觉智能体。

Result: MUG在三个关键维度上改进了MAD协议：实现基于反事实测试的事实验证、引入动态证据源的跨证据推理、促进主动推理而非被动回答。

Conclusion: MUG为LLMs的多模态推理提供了更可靠有效的框架，源代码已开源。

Abstract: Hallucination continues to pose a major obstacle in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Although the Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) paradigm offers a promising solution by promoting consensus among multiple agents to enhance reliability, it relies on the unrealistic assumption that all debaters are rational and reflective, which is a condition that may not hold when agents themselves are prone to hallucinations. To address this gap, we introduce the Multi-agent Undercover Gaming (MUG) protocol, inspired by social deduction games like "Who is Undercover?". MUG reframes MAD as a process of detecting "undercover" agents (those suffering from hallucinations) by employing multimodal counterfactual tests. Specifically, we modify reference images to introduce counterfactual evidence and observe whether agents can accurately identify these changes, providing ground-truth for identifying hallucinating agents and enabling robust, crowd-powered multimodal reasoning. MUG advances MAD protocols along three key dimensions: (1) enabling factual verification beyond statistical consensus through counterfactual testing; (2) introducing cross-evidence reasoning via dynamically modified evidence sources instead of relying on static inputs; and (3) fostering active reasoning, where agents engage in probing discussions rather than passively answering questions. Collectively, these innovations offer a more reliable and effective framework for multimodal reasoning in LLMs. The source code can be accessed at https://github.com/YongLD/MUG.git.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在不确定性下进行反事实决策时，决策者通常通过比较候选行动的期望潜在结果来做出选择。本文旨在引入新的决策规则来改进这一过程。

Method: 提出了PoR和PoB两个新指标，建立了识别定理和边界推导，开发了估计方法，并通过数值实验验证了估计器的有限样本性质。

Result: 通过数值实验验证了估计器的性能，并在真实世界数据集上展示了这些指标的应用价值。

Conclusion: PoR和PoB为反事实决策提供了新的有效工具，能够帮助决策者更好地在不确定性下进行决策。

Abstract: Counterfactual decision-making in the face of uncertainty involves selecting the optimal action from several alternatives using causal reasoning. Decision-makers often rank expected potential outcomes (or their corresponding utility and desirability) to compare the preferences of candidate actions. In this paper, we study new counterfactual decision-making rules by introducing two new metrics: the probabilities of potential outcome ranking (PoR) and the probability of achieving the best potential outcome (PoB). PoR reveals the most probable ranking of potential outcomes for an individual, and PoB indicates the action most likely to yield the top-ranked outcome for an individual. We then establish identification theorems and derive bounds for these metrics, and present estimation methods. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to illustrate the finite-sample properties of the estimators and demonstrate their application to a real-world dataset.

Conclusion: 确定了自我评估、元推理和人类对齐推理控制等开放挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made reasoning a central benchmark for evaluating intelligence. While prior surveys focus on efficiency by examining how to shorten reasoning chains or reduce computation, this view overlooks a fundamental challenge: current LLMs apply uniform reasoning strategies regardless of task complexity, generating long traces for trivial problems while failing to extend reasoning for difficult tasks. This survey reframes reasoning through the lens of {adaptivity}: the capability to allocate reasoning effort based on input characteristics such as difficulty and uncertainty. We make three contributions. First, we formalize deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning within the LLM context, connecting these classical cognitive paradigms with their algorithmic realizations. Second, we formalize adaptive reasoning as a control-augmented policy optimization problem balancing task performance with computational cost, distinguishing learned policies from inference-time control mechanisms. Third, we propose a systematic taxonomy organizing existing methods into training-based approaches that internalize adaptivity through reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, and learned controllers, and training-free approaches that achieve adaptivity through prompt conditioning, feedback-driven halting, and modular composition. This framework clarifies how different mechanisms realize adaptive reasoning in practice and enables systematic comparison across diverse strategies. We conclude by identifying open challenges in self-evaluation, meta-reasoning, and human-aligned reasoning control.

Abstract: Operational safety at mission-critical work sites is a top priority given the complex and hazardous nature of daily tasks. This paper presents the Human-Agent Risk Navigation and Event Safety System (HARNESS), a modular AI framework designed to forecast hazardous events and analyze operational risks in U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) environments. HARNESS integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with structured work data, historical event retrieval, and risk analysis to proactively identify potential hazards. A human-in-the-loop mechanism allows subject matter experts (SMEs) to refine predictions, creating an adaptive learning loop that enhances performance over time. By combining SME collaboration with iterative agentic reasoning, HARNESS improves the reliability and efficiency of predictive safety systems. Preliminary deployment shows promising results, with future work focusing on quantitative evaluation of accuracy, SME agreement, and decision latency reduction.

Conclusion: HyperComplEx通过自适应几何空间组合有效解决了知识图谱嵌入中的关系多样性问题，具有良好的可扩展性和推理效率。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs have emerged as fundamental structures for representing complex relational data across scientific and enterprise domains. However, existing embedding methods face critical limitations when modeling diverse relationship types at scale: Euclidean models struggle with hierarchies, vector space models cannot capture asymmetry, and hyperbolic models fail on symmetric relations. We propose HyperComplEx, a hybrid embedding framework that adaptively combines hyperbolic, complex, and Euclidean spaces via learned attention mechanisms. A relation-specific space weighting strategy dynamically selects optimal geometries for each relation type, while a multi-space consistency loss ensures coherent predictions across spaces. We evaluate HyperComplEx on computer science research knowledge graphs ranging from 1K papers (~25K triples) to 10M papers (~45M triples), demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines including TransE, RotatE, DistMult, ComplEx, SEPA, and UltraE. Additional tests on standard benchmarks confirm significantly higher results than all baselines. On the 10M-paper dataset, HyperComplEx achieves 0.612 MRR, a 4.8% relative gain over the best baseline, while maintaining efficient training, achieving 85 ms inference per triple. The model scales near-linearly with graph size through adaptive dimension allocation. We release our implementation and dataset family to facilitate reproducible research in scalable knowledge graph embeddings.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了AI在处理异构碰撞数据方面的卓越能力，在重建碰撞动力学和表征事故前行为方面提供了前所未有的精确度。

Abstract: Traffic collision reconstruction traditionally relies on human expertise, often yielding inconsistent results when analyzing incomplete multimodal data. This study develops a multi-agent AI framework that reconstructs pre-crash scenarios and infers vehicle behaviors from fragmented collision data. We present a two-phase collaborative framework combining reconstruction and reasoning phases. The system processes 277 rear-end lead vehicle deceleration (LVD) collisions from the Crash Investigation Sampling System, integrating textual crash reports, structured tabular data, and visual scene diagrams. Phase I generates natural-language crash reconstructions from multimodal inputs. Phase II performs in-depth crash reasoning by combining these reconstructions with temporal Event Data Recorder (EDR).For validation, we applied it to all LVD cases, focusing on a subset of 39 complex crashes where multiple EDR records per collision introduced ambiguity (e.g., due to missing or conflicting data).The evaluation of the 39 LVD crash cases revealed our framework achieved perfect accuracy across all test cases, successfully identifying both the most relevant EDR event and correctly distinguishing striking versus struck vehicles, surpassing the 92% accuracy achieved by human researchers on the same challenging dataset. The system maintained robust performance even when processing incomplete data, including missing or erroneous EDR records and ambiguous scene diagrams. This study demonstrates superior AI capabilities in processing heterogeneous collision data, providing unprecedented precision in reconstructing impact dynamics and characterizing pre-crash behaviors.

Abstract: Conventional planning units or urban regions, such as census tracts, zip codes, or neighborhoods, often do not capture the specific demands of local communities and lack the flexibility to implement effective strategies for hazard prevention or response. To support the creation of dynamic planning units, we introduce a planning support system with agentic AI that enables users to generate demand-oriented regions for disaster planning, integrating the human-in-the-loop principle for transparency and adaptability. The platform is built on a representative initialized spatially constrained self-organizing map (RepSC-SOM), extending traditional SOM with adaptive geographic filtering and region-growing refinement, while AI agents can reason, plan, and act to guide the process by suggesting input features, guiding spatial constraints, and supporting interactive exploration. We demonstrate the capabilities of the platform through a case study on the flooding-related risk in Jacksonville, Florida, showing how it allows users to explore, generate, and evaluate regionalization interactively, combining computational rigor with user-driven decision making.

Abstract: Understanding the interactions between biomarkers among brain regions during neurodegenerative disease is essential for unravelling the mechanisms underlying disease progression. For example, pathophysiological models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) typically describe how variables, such as regional levels of toxic proteins, interact spatiotemporally within a dynamical system driven by an underlying biological substrate, often based on brain connectivity. However, current methods grossly oversimplify the complex relationship between brain connectivity by assuming a single-modality brain connectome as the disease-spreading substrate. This leads to inaccurate predictions of pathology spread, especially during the long-term progression period. Meanhwile, other methods of learning such a graph in a purely data-driven way face the identifiability issue due to lack of proper constraint. We thus present a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as expert guides on the interaction of regional variables to enhance learning of disease progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal patient data. By leveraging LLMs' ability to synthesize multi-modal relationships and incorporate diverse disease-driving mechanisms, our method simultaneously optimizes 1) the construction of long-term disease trajectories from individual-level observations and 2) the biologically-constrained graph structure that captures interactions among brain regions with better identifiability. We demonstrate the new approach by estimating the pathology propagation using tau-PET imaging data from an Alzheimer's disease cohort. The new framework demonstrates superior prediction accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional approaches while revealing additional disease-driving factors beyond conventional connectivity measures.

Abstract: Legal compliance in AI-driven data transfer planning is becoming increasingly critical under stringent privacy regulations such as the Japanese Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI). We propose a multi-agent legal verifier that decomposes compliance checking into specialized agents for statutory interpretation, business context evaluation, and risk assessment, coordinated through a structured synthesis protocol. Evaluated on a stratified dataset of 200 Amended APPI Article 16 cases with clearly defined ground truth labels and multiple performance metrics, the system achieves 72% accuracy, which is 21 percentage points higher than a single-agent baseline, including 90% accuracy on clear compliance cases (vs. 16% for the baseline) while maintaining perfect detection of clear violations. While challenges remain in ambiguous scenarios, these results show that domain specialization and coordinated reasoning can meaningfully improve legal AI performance, providing a scalable and regulation-aware framework for trustworthy and interpretable automated compliance verification.

Abstract: Deployed, autonomous AI systems must often evaluate multiple plausible courses of action (extended sequences of behavior) in novel or under-specified contexts. Despite extensive training, these systems will inevitably encounter scenarios where no available course of action fully satisfies all operational constraints (e.g., operating procedures, rules, laws, norms, and goals). To achieve goals in accordance with human expectations and values, agents must go beyond their trained policies and instead construct, evaluate, and justify candidate courses of action. These processes require contextual "knowledge" that may lie outside prior (policy) training. This paper characterizes requirements for agent decision making in these contexts. It also identifies the types of knowledge agents require to make decisions robust to agent goals and aligned with human expectations. Drawing on both analysis and empirical case studies, we examine how agents need to integrate normative, pragmatic, and situational understanding to select and then to pursue more aligned courses of action in complex, real-world environments.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of e-commerce platforms generates vast amounts of unstructured product data, creating significant challenges for information retrieval, recommendation systems, and data analytics. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a structured, interpretable format to organize such data, yet constructing product-specific KGs remains a complex and manual process. This paper introduces a fully automated, AI agent-driven framework for constructing product knowledge graphs directly from unstructured product descriptions. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), our method operates in three stages using dedicated agents: ontology creation and expansion, ontology refinement, and knowledge graph population. This agent-based approach ensures semantic coherence, scalability, and high-quality output without relying on predefined schemas or handcrafted extraction rules. We evaluate the system on a real-world dataset of air conditioner product descriptions, demonstrating strong performance in both ontology generation and KG population. The framework achieves over 97\% property coverage and minimal redundancy, validating its effectiveness and practical applicability. Our work highlights the potential of LLMs to automate structured knowledge extraction in retail, providing a scalable path toward intelligent product data integration and utilization.

Conclusion: 新方法在破坏抽象结构对称性方面比现有方法更有效，能够更好地处理约束编程中的对称性问题。

Abstract: In constraint programming and related paradigms, a modeller specifies their problem in a modelling language for a solver to search and return its solution(s). Using high-level modelling languages such as Essence, a modeller may express their problems in terms of abstract structures. These are structures not natively supported by the solvers, and so they have to be transformed into or represented as other structures before solving. For example, nested sets are abstract structures, and they can be represented as matrices in constraint solvers. Many problems contain symmetries and one very common and highly successful technique used in constraint programming is to "break" symmetries, to avoid searching for symmetric solutions. This can speed up the solving process by many orders of magnitude. Most of these symmetry-breaking techniques involve placing some kind of ordering for the variables of the problem, and picking a particular member under the symmetries, usually the smallest. Unfortunately, applying this technique to abstract variables produces a very large number of complex constraints that perform poorly in practice. In this paper, we demonstrate a new incomplete method of breaking the symmetries of abstract structures by better exploiting their representations. We apply the method in breaking the symmetries arising from indistinguishable objects, a commonly occurring type of symmetry, and show that our method is faster than the previous methods proposed in (Akgün et al. 2025).

Abstract: Recent studies on LLM agent scaling have highlighted the potential of Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) to enhance reasoning abilities. However, the critical aspect of role allocation strategies remains underexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that allocating roles with differing viewpoints to specific positions significantly impacts MAD's performance in reasoning tasks. Specifically, we find a novel role allocation strategy, "Truth Last", which can improve MAD performance by up to 22% in reasoning tasks. To address the issue of unknown truth in practical applications, we propose the Multi-Agent Debate Consistency (MADC) strategy, which systematically simulates and optimizes its core mechanisms. MADC incorporates path consistency to assess agreement among independent roles, simulating the role with the highest consistency score as the truth. We validated MADC across a range of LLMs (9 models), including the DeepSeek-R1 Distilled Models, on challenging reasoning tasks. MADC consistently demonstrated advanced performance, effectively overcoming MAD's performance bottlenecks and providing a crucial pathway for further improvements in LLM agent scaling.

TL;DR: 提出了DSS框架，利用可微分模拟器Waymax作为状态预测器和评估器，通过梯度下降优化动作序列，显著提升了自动驾驶的跟踪和路径规划精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶中，规划对于避免碰撞和在复杂密集交通场景中导航至关重要。传统方法在需要同时学习策略、状态预测器和评估器时面临挑战。

Method: 使用可微分模拟器Waymax作为状态预测器和评估器，利用其硬编码动力学实现准确状态预测，通过可微分特性在动作序列上进行有效搜索，使用梯度下降优化想象中的未来轨迹。

Result: 实验表明，DSS（规划梯度和随机搜索的组合）相比序列预测、模仿学习、无模型强化学习和其他规划方法，显著提高了跟踪和路径规划精度。

Conclusion: DSS框架通过结合规划梯度和随机搜索，为自动驾驶规划提供了有效的解决方案，能够显著提升性能。

Abstract: Planning allows an agent to safely refine its actions before executing them in the real world. In autonomous driving, this is crucial to avoid collisions and navigate in complex, dense traffic scenarios. One way to plan is to search for the best action sequence. However, this is challenging when all necessary components - policy, next-state predictor, and critic - have to be learned. Here we propose Differentiable Simulation for Search (DSS), a framework that leverages the differentiable simulator Waymax as both a next state predictor and a critic. It relies on the simulator's hardcoded dynamics, making state predictions highly accurate, while utilizing the simulator's differentiability to effectively search across action sequences. Our DSS agent optimizes its actions using gradient descent over imagined future trajectories. We show experimentally that DSS - the combination of planning gradients and stochastic search - significantly improves tracking and path planning accuracy compared to sequence prediction, imitation learning, model-free RL, and other planning methods.

TL;DR: ARCTraj是一个数据集和方法框架，用于通过抽象推理语料库中的复杂视觉任务建模人类推理过程，记录时间有序的对象级动作来揭示中间推理步骤。


<details>

Motivation: 现有ARC方法主要依赖静态输入-输出监督，无法洞察推理的时间展开过程，ARCTraj旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过O2ARC网络接口收集约10,000条轨迹，包含任务标识符、时间戳和成功标签，定义了统一推理管道，包括数据收集、动作抽象、MDP制定和下游学习。

Result: 收集了400个训练任务的轨迹数据，分析了空间选择、颜色归因和策略收敛，揭示了人类推理的结构和多样性。

Conclusion: ARCTraj为研究类人推理提供了结构化和可解释的基础，推动了可解释性、对齐性和通用智能的发展。

Abstract: We present ARCTraj, a dataset and methodological framework for modeling human reasoning through complex visual tasks in the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). While ARC has inspired extensive research on abstract reasoning, most existing approaches rely on static input--output supervision, which limits insight into how reasoning unfolds over time. ARCTraj addresses this gap by recording temporally ordered, object-level actions that capture how humans iteratively transform inputs into outputs, revealing intermediate reasoning steps that conventional datasets overlook. Collected via the O2ARC web interface, it contains around 10,000 trajectories annotated with task identifiers, timestamps, and success labels across 400 training tasks from the ARC-AGI-1 benchmark. It further defines a unified reasoning pipeline encompassing data collection, action abstraction, Markov decision process (MDP) formulation, and downstream learning, enabling integration with reinforcement learning, generative modeling, and sequence modeling methods such as PPO, World Models, GFlowNets, Diffusion agents, and Decision Transformers. Analyses of spatial selection, color attribution, and strategic convergence highlight the structure and diversity of human reasoning. Together, these contributions position ARCTraj as a structured and interpretable foundation for studying human-like reasoning, advancing explainability, alignment, and generalizable intelligence.

Conclusion: 该方法能够学习有效的广义计划和搜索空间剪枝公理，为广义规划提供了一种简单而有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Generalised planning (GP) refers to the task of synthesising programs that solve families of related planning problems. We introduce a novel, yet simple method for GP: given a set of training problems, for each problem, compute an optimal plan for each goal atom in some order, perform goal regression on the resulting plans, and lift the corresponding outputs to obtain a set of first-order $\textit{Condition} \rightarrow \textit{Actions}$ rules. The rules collectively constitute a generalised plan that can be executed as is or alternatively be used to prune the planning search space. We formalise and prove the conditions under which our method is guaranteed to learn valid generalised plans and state space pruning axioms for search. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art (generalised) planners with respect to the 3 metrics of synthesis cost, planning coverage, and solution quality on various classical and numeric planning domains.

Abstract: The advent of Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) signals a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, moving from passive perception to active, cross-modal generation. Despite their unprecedented ability to synthesize information, a critical gap persists in evaluation: existing benchmarks primarily assess discriminative understanding or unconstrained image generation separately, failing to measure the integrated cognitive process of generative reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose that geometric construction provides an ideal testbed as it inherently demands a fusion of language comprehension and precise visual generation. We introduce GGBench, a benchmark designed specifically to evaluate geometric generative reasoning. It provides a comprehensive framework for systematically diagnosing a model's ability to not only understand and reason but to actively construct a solution, thereby setting a more rigorous standard for the next generation of intelligent systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM表格推理方法存在推理深度不足、缺乏迭代优化和推理过程不稳定的问题，限制了在实际应用中的可靠性。

Method: 提出STaR框架：训练阶段使用两阶段难度感知强化学习，从简单到复杂渐进学习；推理阶段通过token级置信度和答案一致性进行轨迹级不确定性量化。

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得优异性能，推理稳定性显著提升，在域外数据集上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: STaR为LLM表格推理提供了可靠且受认知启发的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Table reasoning with the large language models (LLMs) is a fundamental path toward building intelligent systems that can understand and analyze over structured data. While recent progress has shown promising results, they still suffer from two key limitations: (i) the reasoning processes lack the depth and iterative refinement characteristic of human cognition; and (ii) the reasoning processes exhibit instability, which compromises their reliability in downstream applications. In this work, we present STaR (slow-thinking for table reasoning), a new framework achieving cognitive table reasoning, in which LLMs are equipped with slow-thinking capabilities by explicitly modeling step-by-step thinking and uncertainty-aware inference. During training, STaR employs two-stage difficulty-aware reinforcement learning (DRL), progressively learning from simple to complex queries under a composite reward. During inference, STaR performs trajectory-level uncertainty quantification by integrating token-level confidence and answer consistency, enabling selection of more credible reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that STaR achieves superior performance and enhanced reasoning stability. Moreover, strong generalization over out-of-domain datasets further demonstrates STaR's potential as a reliable and cognitively inspired solution for table reasoning with LLMs.

Abstract: Autonomous aerial systems increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) for mission planning, perception, and decision-making, yet the lack of standardized and physically grounded benchmarks limits systematic evaluation of their reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce UAVBench, an open benchmark dataset comprising 50,000 validated UAV flight scenarios generated through taxonomy-guided LLM prompting and multi-stage safety validation. Each scenario is encoded in a structured JSON schema that includes mission objectives, vehicle configuration, environmental conditions, and quantitative risk labels, providing a unified representation of UAV operations across diverse domains. Building on this foundation, we present UAVBench_MCQ, a reasoning-oriented extension containing 50,000 multiple-choice questions spanning ten cognitive and ethical reasoning styles, ranging from aerodynamics and navigation to multi-agent coordination and integrated reasoning. This framework enables interpretable and machine-checkable assessment of UAV-specific cognition under realistic operational contexts. We evaluate 32 state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-5, ChatGPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, DeepSeek V3, Qwen3 235B, and ERNIE 4.5 300B, and find strong performance in perception and policy reasoning but persistent challenges in ethics-aware and resource-constrained decision-making. UAVBench establishes a reproducible and physically grounded foundation for benchmarking agentic AI in autonomous aerial systems and advancing next-generation UAV reasoning intelligence. To support open science and reproducibility, we release the UAVBench dataset, the UAVBench_MCQ benchmark, evaluation scripts, and all related materials on GitHub at https://github.com/maferrag/UAVBench

Abstract: The discovery of novel Ionic Liquids (ILs) is hindered by critical challenges in property prediction, including limited data, poor model accuracy, and fragmented workflows. Leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce AIonopedia, to the best of our knowledge, the first LLM agent for IL discovery. Powered by an LLM-augmented multimodal domain foundation model for ILs, AIonopedia enables accurate property predictions and incorporates a hierarchical search architecture for molecular screening and design. Trained and evaluated on a newly curated and comprehensive IL dataset, our model delivers superior performance. Complementing these results, evaluations on literature-reported systems indicate that the agent can perform effective IL modification. Moving beyond offline tests, the practical efficacy was further confirmed through real-world wet-lab validation, in which the agent demonstrated exceptional generalization capabilities on challenging out-of-distribution tasks, underscoring its ability to accelerate real-world IL discovery.

Abstract: An ever increasing number of high-stake decisions are made or assisted by automated systems employing brittle artificial intelligence technology. There is a substantial risk that some of these decision induce harm to people, by infringing their well-being or their fundamental human rights. The state-of-the-art in AI systems makes little effort with respect to appropriate documentation of the decision process. This obstructs the ability to trace what went into a decision, which in turn is a prerequisite to any attempt of reconstructing a responsibility chain. Specifically, such traceability is linked to a documentation that will stand up in court when determining the cause of some AI-based decision that inadvertently or intentionally violates the law.
  This paper takes a radical, yet practical, approach to this problem, by enforcing the documentation of each and every component that goes into the training or inference of an automated decision. As such, it presents the first running workflow supporting the generation of tamper-proof, verifiable and exhaustive traces of AI decisions. In doing so, we expand the DBOM concept into an effective running workflow leveraging confidential computing technology. We demonstrate the inner workings of the workflow in the development of an app to tell poisonous and edible mushrooms apart, meant as a playful example of high-stake decision support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法只能单独解释正蕴含（为什么C(a)被知识库蕴含）或缺失蕴含（为什么C(b)不被蕴含），缺乏同时考虑两者的对比解释方法。

Method: 为描述逻辑本体的ABox推理开发了对比解释的适当概念，分析了不同变体在不同最优性标准下的计算复杂度，考虑了轻量级和更表达性的描述逻辑。

Result: 实现了计算对比解释变体的首个方法，并在现实知识库的生成问题上进行了评估。

Conclusion: 对比ABox解释能够同时处理正蕴含和缺失蕴含，关注个体间的相关差异，为描述逻辑推理提供了更全面的解释框架。

Abstract: We introduce the notion of contrastive ABox explanations to answer questions of the type "Why is a an instance of C, but b is not?". While there are various approaches for explaining positive entailments (why is C(a) entailed by the knowledge base) as well as missing entailments (why is C(b) not entailed) in isolation, contrastive explanations consider both at the same time, which allows them to focus on the relevant commonalities and differences between a and b. We develop an appropriate notion of contrastive explanations for the special case of ABox reasoning with description logic ontologies, and analyze the computational complexity for different variants under different optimality criteria, considering lightweight as well as more expressive description logics. We implemented a first method for computing one variant of contrastive explanations, and evaluated it on generated problems for realistic knowledge bases.

TL;DR: EcoAlign是一个推理时框架，将大型视觉语言模型的对齐问题重新定义为经济理性的搜索过程，通过前瞻性函数动态权衡安全性、效用和成本，在较低计算成本下实现更好的安全性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型视觉语言模型的对齐方法在安全性、实用性和运营成本之间存在权衡困难，且仅关注最终输出的过程盲目性会浪费大量计算资源在不安全的推理上，有害推理可能通过良性理由伪装来规避简单安全评分。

Method: 将LVLM视为有限理性智能体，增量扩展思维图，使用前瞻性函数（类似净现值）对行动进行评分，动态权衡预期安全性、效用和成本与剩余预算的关系，通过最薄弱环节原则强制执行路径安全性。

Result: 在3个闭源和2个开源模型的6个数据集上进行广泛实验，EcoAlign在较低计算成本下达到或超越了最先进的安全性和实用性水平。

Conclusion: EcoAlign为稳健的LVLM对齐提供了一条原则性、经济性的路径。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit powerful reasoning capabilities but suffer sophisticated jailbreak vulnerabilities. Fundamentally, aligning LVLMs is not just a safety challenge but a problem of economic efficiency. Current alignment methods struggle with the trade-off between safety, utility, and operational costs. Critically, a focus solely on final outputs (process-blindness) wastes significant computational budget on unsafe deliberation. This flaw allows harmful reasoning to be disguised with benign justifications, thereby circumventing simple additive safety scores. To address this, we propose EcoAlign, an inference-time framework that reframes alignment as an economically rational search by treating the LVLM as a boundedly rational agent. EcoAlign incrementally expands a thought graph and scores actions using a forward-looking function (analogous to net present value) that dynamically weighs expected safety, utility, and cost against the remaining budget. To prevent deception, path safety is enforced via the weakest-link principle. Extensive experiments across 3 closed-source and 2 open-source models on 6 datasets show that EcoAlign matches or surpasses state-of-the-art safety and utility at a lower computational cost, thereby offering a principled, economical pathway to robust LVLM alignment.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在社交导航中的局限性：基于规则的方法缺乏泛化性，而数据驱动方法缺乏可解释性和难以与人类直觉对齐。

Method: 将基于实证行为实验的社会运动模型集成到强化学习的奖励函数中，生成方向敏感的社会舒适度场，共同优化机械能量和社会舒适度。

Result: 在沉浸式VR实验中，RLSLM在用户体验方面优于最先进的基于规则模型，且比传统数据驱动方法具有显著改进的可解释性。

Conclusion: 该工作提出了一个可扩展的、以人为中心的方法论，有效整合认知科学和机器学习，用于现实世界的社交导航。

Abstract: Navigating human-populated environments without causing discomfort is a critical capability for socially-aware agents. While rule-based approaches offer interpretability through predefined psychological principles, they often lack generalizability and flexibility. Conversely, data-driven methods can learn complex behaviors from large-scale datasets, but are typically inefficient, opaque, and difficult to align with human intuitions. To bridge this gap, we propose RLSLM, a hybrid Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates a rule-based Social Locomotion Model, grounded in empirical behavioral experiments, into the reward function of a reinforcement learning framework. The social locomotion model generates an orientation-sensitive social comfort field that quantifies human comfort across space, enabling socially aligned navigation policies with minimal training. RLSLM then jointly optimizes mechanical energy and social comfort, allowing agents to avoid intrusions into personal or group space. A human-agent interaction experiment using an immersive VR-based setup demonstrates that RLSLM outperforms state-of-the-art rule-based models in user experience. Ablation and sensitivity analyses further show the model's significantly improved interpretability over conventional data-driven methods. This work presents a scalable, human-centered methodology that effectively integrates cognitive science and machine learning for real-world social navigation.

Abstract: We introduce KarmaTS, an interactive framework for constructing lag-indexed, executable spatiotemporal causal graphical models for multivariate time series (MTS) simulation. Motivated by the challenge of access-restricted physiological data, KarmaTS generates synthetic MTS with known causal dynamics and augments real-world datasets with expert knowledge. The system constructs a discrete-time structural causal process (DSCP) by combining expert knowledge and algorithmic proposals in a mixed-initiative, human-in-the-loop workflow. The resulting DSCP supports simulation and causal interventions, including those under user-specified distribution shifts. KarmaTS handles mixed variable types, contemporaneous and lagged edges, and modular edge functionals ranging from parameterizable templates to neural network models. Together, these features enable flexible validation and benchmarking of causal discovery algorithms through expert-informed simulation.

Conclusion: MarsRL有潜力推进多智能体推理系统的发展，并扩大其在各种推理任务中的适用性。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has been propelled by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and test-time scaling. However, the limited output length of LLMs constrains the depth of reasoning attainable in a single inference process. Multi-agent reasoning systems offer a promising alternative by employing multiple agents including Solver, Verifier, and Corrector, to iteratively refine solutions. While effective in closed-source models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, they struggle to generalize to open-source models due to insufficient critic and correction capabilities. To address this, we propose MarsRL, a novel reinforcement learning framework with agentic pipeline parallelism, designed to jointly optimize all agents in the system. MarsRL introduces agent-specific reward mechanisms to mitigate reward noise and employs pipeline-inspired training to enhance efficiency in handling long trajectories. Applied to Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507, MarsRL improves AIME2025 accuracy from 86.5% to 93.3% and BeyondAIME from 64.9% to 73.8%, even surpassing Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507. These findings highlight the potential of MarsRL to advance multi-agent reasoning systems and broaden their applicability across diverse reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: 提出了统一方法，通过共同设计通信、学习和鲁棒性来弥合理论MARL模型与实际实现之间的差距，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has made significant strides in enabling coordinated behaviors among autonomous agents. However, most existing approaches assume that communication is instantaneous, reliable, and has unlimited bandwidth; these conditions are rarely met in real-world deployments. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in robust and efficient communication strategies for MARL under realistic constraints, including message perturbations, transmission delays, and limited bandwidth. Furthermore, because the challenges of low-latency reliability, bandwidth-intensive data sharing, and communication-privacy trade-offs are central to practical MARL systems, we focus on three applications involving cooperative autonomous driving, distributed simultaneous localization and mapping, and federated learning. Finally, we identify key open challenges and future research directions, advocating a unified approach that co-designs communication, learning, and robustness to bridge the gap between theoretical MARL models and practical implementations.

Physicians draw on these multimodal and temporal sources of EHR data to form a comprehensive view of a patient's health, which is crucial for informed therapeutic decision-making. Yet, most predictive models fail to fully capture the interactions, redundancies, and temporal patterns across multiple data modalities, often focusing on a single data type or overlooking these complexities. In this paper, we present CURENet, a multimodal model (Combining Unified Representations for Efficient chronic disease prediction) that integrates unstructured clinical notes, lab tests, and patients' time-series data by utilizing large language models (LLMs) for clinical text processing and textual lab tests, as well as transformer encoders for longitudinal sequential visits. CURENet has been capable of capturing the intricate interaction between different forms of clinical data and creating a more reliable predictive model for chronic illnesses. We evaluated CURENet using the public MIMIC-III and private FEMH datasets, where it achieved over 94\% accuracy in predicting the top 10 chronic conditions in a multi-label framework. Our findings highlight the potential of multimodal EHR integration to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.

Abstract: Enabling agentic AI systems to adapt their problem-solving approaches based on post-training interactions remains a fundamental challenge. While systems that update and maintain a memory at inference time have been proposed, existing designs only steer the system by modifying textual input to a language model or agent, which means that they cannot change sampling parameters, remove tools, modify system prompts, or switch between agentic and workflow paradigms. On the other hand, systems that adapt more flexibly require offline optimization and remain static once deployed. We present Experience-Guided Reasoner (EGuR), which generates tailored strategies -- complete computational procedures involving LLM calls, tools, sampling parameters, and control logic -- dynamically at inference time based on accumulated experience. We achieve this using an LLM-based meta-strategy -- a strategy that outputs strategies -- enabling adaptation of all strategy components (prompts, sampling parameters, tool configurations, and control logic). EGuR operates through two components: a Guide generates multiple candidate strategies conditioned on the current problem and structured memory of past experiences, while a Consolidator integrates execution feedback to improve future strategy generation. This produces complete, ready-to-run strategies optimized for each problem, which can be cached, retrieved, and executed as needed without wasting resources. Across five challenging benchmarks (AIME 2025, 3-SAT, and three Big Bench Extra Hard tasks), EGuR achieves up to 14% accuracy improvements over the strongest baselines while reducing computational costs by up to 111x, with both metrics improving as the system gains experience.

Abstract: The deployment of decision-making AI agents presents a critical challenge in maintaining alignment with human values or guidelines while operating in complex, dynamic environments. Agents trained solely to achieve their objectives may adopt harmful behavior, exposing a key trade-off between maximizing the reward function and maintaining the alignment. For the pre-trained agents, ensuring alignment is particularly challenging, as retraining can be a costly and slow process. This is further complicated by the diverse and potentially conflicting attributes representing the ethical values for alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a test-time alignment technique based on model-guided policy shaping. Our method allows precise control over individual behavioral attributes, generalizes across diverse reinforcement learning (RL) environments, and facilitates a principled trade-off between ethical alignment and reward maximization without requiring agent retraining. We evaluate our approach using the MACHIAVELLI benchmark, which comprises 134 text-based game environments and thousands of annotated scenarios involving ethical decisions. The RL agents are first trained to maximize the reward in their respective games. At test time, we apply policy shaping via scenario-action attribute classifiers to ensure decision alignment with ethical attributes. We compare our approach against prior training-time methods and general-purpose agents, as well as study several types of ethical violations and power-seeking behavior. Our results demonstrate that test-time policy shaping provides an effective and scalable solution for mitigating unethical behavior across diverse environments and alignment attributes.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Audio-Video Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) have enhanced their capabilities in tasks like audio-visual question answering and multimodal dialog systems. Video and audio introduce an extended temporal dimension, resulting in a larger key-value (KV) cache compared to static image embedding. A naive optimization strategy is to selectively focus on and retain KV caches of audio or video based on task. However, in the experiment, we observed that the attention of AV-LLMs to various modalities in the high layers is not strictly dependent on the task. In higher layers, the attention of AV-LLMs shifts more towards the video modality. In addition, we also found that directly integrating temporal KV of audio and spatial-temporal KV of video may lead to information confusion and significant performance degradation of AV-LLMs. If audio and video are processed indiscriminately, it may also lead to excessive compression or reservation of a certain modality, thereby disrupting the alignment between modalities. To address these challenges, we propose AccKV, an Adaptive-Focusing and Cross-Calibration KV cache optimization framework designed specifically for efficient AV-LLMs inference. Our method is based on layer adaptive focusing technology, selectively focusing on key modalities according to the characteristics of different layers, and enhances the recognition of heavy hitter tokens through attention redistribution. In addition, we propose a Cross-Calibration technique that first integrates inefficient KV caches within the audio and video modalities, and then aligns low-priority modalities with high-priority modalities to selectively evict KV cache of low-priority modalities. The experimental results show that AccKV can significantly improve the computational efficiency of AV-LLMs while maintaining accuracy.
