### [1] [Towards Efficient General Feature Prediction in Masked Skeleton Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03609)
*Shengkai Sun,Zefan Zhang,Jianfeng Dong,Zhiyong Cheng,Xiaojun Chang,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GFP框架，用高级特征预测替代传统低级坐标重建，实现高效骨架动作识别


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MAE方法局限于原始关节坐标重建，导致计算冗余和语义表示有限

Method: 采用协作学习框架，轻量级目标生成网络动态产生多样化时空层次监督信号，结合约束优化确保特征多样性

Result: 训练速度比标准方法快6.2倍，在NTU RGB+D 60/120和PKU-MMD数据集上达到SOTA性能

Conclusion: GFP框架通过高级特征预测有效解决了计算冗余问题，提升了骨架动作识别的效率和表示质量

Abstract: Recent advances in the masked autoencoder (MAE) paradigm have significantly
propelled self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition. However, most
existing approaches limit reconstruction targets to raw joint coordinates or
their simple variants, resulting in computational redundancy and limited
semantic representation. To address this, we propose a novel General Feature
Prediction framework (GFP) for efficient mask skeleton modeling. Our key
innovation is replacing conventional low-level reconstruction with high-level
feature prediction that spans from local motion patterns to global semantic
representations. Specifically, we introduce a collaborative learning framework
where a lightweight target generation network dynamically produces diversified
supervision signals across spatial-temporal hierarchies, avoiding reliance on
pre-computed offline features. The framework incorporates constrained
optimization to ensure feature diversity while preventing model collapse.
Experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120 and PKU-MMD demonstrate the benefits
of our approach: Computational efficiency (with 6.2$\times$ faster training
than standard masked skeleton modeling methods) and superior representation
quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various downstream tasks.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于UNet分割的教师-学生模型，通过对比学习和域对抗训练来解决有线分裂检测中的域偏移和数据不平衡问题，在预测试集上取得了迅速的F1分数和平衡准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有线分裂图计数工作耗时且存在观察者间变异性，AI自动检测应该解决这些问题但又面临域偏移和严重的数据不平衡挑战。

Method: 使用UNet分割背链，集成对比表征学习和域对抗训练来实现域通用性。采用教师-学生策略生成像素级假面具，包括注释有线分裂、难以识别的负示例和正常核。分类任务使用多规模CNN分类器，在多任务学习框架中利用分割模型的特征图。

Result: 在预测试集上，算法在轨道一（检测）获得F1分数0.7660，在轨道二（分类）获得平衡准确率0.8414。

Conclusion: 将基于分割的检测和分类集成到统一框架中，可以实现稳健的有线分裂分析，有效解决了域偏移和数据不平衡问题。

Abstract: Counting mitotic figures is time-intensive for pathologists and leads to
inter-observer variability. Artificial intelligence (AI) promises a solution by
automatically detecting mitotic figures while maintaining decision consistency.
However, AI tools are susceptible to domain shift, where a significant drop in
performance can occur due to differences in the training and testing sets,
including morphological diversity between organs, species, and variations in
staining protocols. Furthermore, the number of mitoses is much less than the
count of normal nuclei, which introduces severely imbalanced data for the
detection task. In this work, we formulate mitosis detection as a pixel-level
segmentation and propose a teacher-student model that simultaneously addresses
mitosis detection (Track 1) and atypical mitosis classification (Track 2). Our
method is based on a UNet segmentation backbone that integrates domain
generalization modules, namely contrastive representation learning and
domain-adversarial training. A teacher-student strategy is employed to generate
pixel-level pseudo-masks not only for annotated mitoses and hard negatives but
also for normal nuclei, thereby enhancing feature discrimination and improving
robustness against domain shift. For the classification task, we introduce a
multi-scale CNN classifier that leverages feature maps from the segmentation
model within a multi-task learning paradigm. On the preliminary test set, the
algorithm achieved an F1 score of 0.7660 in Track 1 and balanced accuracy of
0.8414 in Track 2, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating
segmentation-based detection and classification into a unified framework for
robust mitosis analysis.

Abstract: Human motion video generation has garnered significant research interest due
to its broad applications, enabling innovations such as photorealistic singing
heads or dynamic avatars that seamlessly dance to music. However, existing
surveys in this field focus on individual methods, lacking a comprehensive
overview of the entire generative process. This paper addresses this gap by
providing an in-depth survey of human motion video generation, encompassing
over ten sub-tasks, and detailing the five key phases of the generation
process: input, motion planning, motion video generation, refinement, and
output. Notably, this is the first survey that discusses the potential of large
language models in enhancing human motion video generation. Our survey reviews
the latest developments and technological trends in human motion video
generation across three primary modalities: vision, text, and audio. By
covering over two hundred papers, we offer a thorough overview of the field and
highlight milestone works that have driven significant technological
breakthroughs. Our goal for this survey is to unveil the prospects of human
motion video generation and serve as a valuable resource for advancing the
comprehensive applications of digital humans. A complete list of the models
examined in this survey is available in Our Repository

### [4] [Multi Attribute Bias Mitigation via Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03616)
*Rajeev Ranjan Dwivedi,Ankur Kumar,Vinod K Kurmi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GMBM是一个两阶段框架，通过显式识别和梯度抑制来同时缓解图像中的多种重叠偏差，无需测试时的组标签，并在多个数据集上显著提升最差组准确率和降低偏差放大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界图像存在多种重叠偏差（纹理、水印、性别特征等），这些偏差会损害视觉模型的鲁棒性和公平性。单独处理每个偏差效果有限，因为缓解一个偏差往往会导致其他偏差加剧。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 自适应偏差集成学习(ABIL)：训练每个属性的编码器并与主干网络集成，强制分类器显式识别偏差；2) 梯度抑制微调：从主干梯度中修剪偏差方向，得到忽略所有学习到的偏差的紧凑网络。还提出了Scaled Bias Amplification(SBA)指标来解决现有偏差度量在子组不平衡和分布偏移下的问题。

Result: 在FB CMNIST、CelebA和COCO数据集上验证，提升了最差组准确率，将多属性偏差放大减半，并在SBA指标上达到新低，即使偏差复杂性和分布偏移加剧。

Conclusion: GMBM是第一个实用的端到端多偏差视觉识别解决方案，能够有效处理现实世界图像中的多种重叠偏差问题。

Abstract: Real world images frequently exhibit multiple overlapping biases, including
textures, watermarks, gendered makeup, scene object pairings, etc. These biases
collectively impair the performance of modern vision models, undermining both
their robustness and fairness. Addressing these biases individually proves
inadequate, as mitigating one bias often permits or intensifies others. We
tackle this multi bias problem with Generalized Multi Bias Mitigation (GMBM), a
lean two stage framework that needs group labels only while training and
minimizes bias at test time. First, Adaptive Bias Integrated Learning (ABIL)
deliberately identifies the influence of known shortcuts by training encoders
for each attribute and integrating them with the main backbone, compelling the
classifier to explicitly recognize these biases. Then Gradient Suppression Fine
Tuning prunes those very bias directions from the backbone's gradients, leaving
a single compact network that ignores all the shortcuts it just learned to
recognize. Moreover we find that existing bias metrics break under subgroup
imbalance and train test distribution shifts, so we introduce Scaled Bias
Amplification (SBA): a test time measure that disentangles model induced bias
amplification from distributional differences. We validate GMBM on FB CMNIST,
CelebA, and COCO, where we boost worst group accuracy, halve multi attribute
bias amplification, and set a new low in SBA even as bias complexity and
distribution shifts intensify, making GMBM the first practical, end to end
multibias solution for visual recognition. Project page:

### [5] [TEn-CATS: Text-Enriched Audio-Visual Video Parsing with Multi-Scale Category-Aware Temporal Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04086)
*Yaru Chen,Faegheh Sardari,Peiliang Zhang,Ruohao Guo,Yang Xiang,Zhenbo Li,Wenwu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过双向文本融合模块和类别感知时序图模块，提出了一种新的弱监督音视频解析方法，解决了低质量偏偏标签在训练过程中被放大的问题，在两个标准数据集上达到了最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的音视频解析方法存在两类问题：一类将噪声分段偏偏标签视为可靠监督，另一类让无区别关注将偏偏标签平均分布到所有帧，导致初始错误在训练中被重复放大。

Method: 结合了两种方向的优势，提出了双向文本融合模块（BiT）和类别感知时序图模块（CATS）。通过BiT模块对音频和视觉模态特征进行语义注入和动态检查，定位和净化更清洁丰富的语义线索；通过CATS模块进行语义传播和连接，实现精确的语义信息在时间上的传播。

Result: 在LLP和UnAV-100两个标准数据集上，该方法在多个关键指标上达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了弱监督音视频解析中偏偏标签噪声被放大的问题，通过结合两种优势的方法，实现了更准确的事件类别识别和时间定位。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Video Parsing (AVVP) task aims to identify event categories and
their occurrence times in a given video with weakly supervised labels. Existing
methods typically fall into two categories: (i) designing enhanced
architectures based on attention mechanism for better temporal modeling, and
(ii) generating richer pseudo-labels to compensate for the absence of
frame-level annotations. However, the first type methods treat noisy
segment-level pseudo labels as reliable supervision and the second type methods
let indiscriminate attention spread them across all frames, the initial errors
are repeatedly amplified during training. To address this issue, we propose a
method that combines the Bi-Directional Text Fusion (BiT) module and
Category-Aware Temporal Graph (CATS) module. Specifically, we integrate the
strengths and complementarity of the two previous research directions. We first
perform semantic injection and dynamic calibration on audio and visual modality
features through the BiT module, to locate and purify cleaner and richer
semantic cues. Then, we leverage the CATS module for semantic propagation and
connection to enable precise semantic information dissemination across time.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multiple key indicators on two benchmark
datasets, LLP and UnAV-100.

*Anders Kjelsrud,Lasse Løvstakken,Erik Smistad,Håvard Dalen,Gilles Van De Vyver*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过消融研究优化了nnU-Net模型，发展出了一种轻量级U-Net结构，在保持类似分割性能的同时大大减少模型参数和计算时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然nnU-Net在左室分割任务上表现良好，但模型过大过慢，限制了实时应用。需要找到无需复杂结构和大型模型容量就能获得优秀性能的最优解。

Method: 进行系统性的消融研究，逐步评估数据增帽方案、网络结构修改、损失函数和后处理技术对性能的影响。基于消融结果设计轻量级U-Net模型。

Result: 新模型仅需2M参数（nnU-Net为33M），在CAMUS数据集上达到统计学等效的性能（Dice指标0.93/0.85/0.89 vs 0.93/0.86/0.89），模型大小减少16倍，速度提升4倍（每帧1.35ms vs 5.40ms）。跨数据集验证显示了类似的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 简单的affine增帽和深度监督是驱动性能的关键因素，而复杂增帽和大型模型带来的收益逐渐减少。通过简化模型可以在保持性能的同时实现更高的效率。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle in echocardiography can enable
fully automatic extraction of clinical measurements such as volumes and
ejection fraction. While models configured by nnU-Net perform well, they are
large and slow, thus limiting real-time use. We identified the most effective
components of nnU-Net for cardiac segmentation through an ablation study,
incrementally evaluating data augmentation schemes, architectural
modifications, loss functions, and post-processing techniques. Our analysis
revealed that simple affine augmentations and deep supervision drive
performance, while complex augmentations and large model capacity offer
diminishing returns. Based on these insights, we developed a lightweight U-Net
(2M vs 33M parameters) that achieves statistically equivalent performance to
nnU-Net on CAMUS (N=500) with Dice scores of 0.93/0.85/0.89 vs 0.93/0.86/0.89
for LV/MYO/LA ($p>0.05$), while being 16 times smaller and 4 times faster
(1.35ms vs 5.40ms per frame) than the default nnU-Net configuration.
Cross-dataset evaluation on an internal dataset (N=311) confirms comparable
generalization.

*Zehong Yan,Peng Qi,Wynne Hsu,Mong Li Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TRUST-VL是一个统一且可解释的视觉语言模型，用于多模态虚假信息检测，通过联合训练不同类型失真实现知识共享和泛化能力提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态虚假信息（包含文本、视觉和跨模态失真）对社会威胁日益严重，现有方法通常只关注单一失真类型且难以泛化到未见场景

Method: 提出TRUST-VL模型，包含新颖的问题感知视觉放大器模块来提取任务特定的视觉特征，并构建TRUST-Instruct大规模指令数据集（198K样本）支持训练

Result: 在领域内和零样本基准测试中均达到最先进性能，展现出强大的泛化能力和可解释性

Conclusion: 联合训练不同类型失真有助于知识共享，显著提升模型在虚假信息检测中的泛化能力和性能

Abstract: Multimodal misinformation, encompassing textual, visual, and cross-modal
distortions, poses an increasing societal threat that is amplified by
generative AI. Existing methods typically focus on a single type of distortion
and struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios. In this work, we observe that
different distortion types share common reasoning capabilities while also
requiring task-specific skills. We hypothesize that joint training across
distortion types facilitates knowledge sharing and enhances the model's ability
to generalize. To this end, we introduce TRUST-VL, a unified and explainable
vision-language model for general multimodal misinformation detection. TRUST-VL
incorporates a novel Question-Aware Visual Amplifier module, designed to
extract task-specific visual features. To support training, we also construct
TRUST-Instruct, a large-scale instruction dataset containing 198K samples
featuring structured reasoning chains aligned with human fact-checking
workflows. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks
demonstrate that TRUST-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance, while also
offering strong generalization and interpretability.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法需要大量注释数据和计算资源，需要一种资源效率更高的无监督方法来处理森林点云数据并提取单木信息

Method: 改进的treeX算法，结合聚类基础的树干检测与区域生长的树冠划分技术，提供了两种参数预设：地面基扫描（TLS和PLS）和无人机扫描（ULS）

Result: 在6个公开数据集上评估，与原算法相比运行时间减少、准确性提高（F1分数提升0.11-0.49），ULS数据下F1分数达0.58，与最新开源方法粘近深度学习等效果

Conclusion: 该方法可作为深度学习的资源效率替代方案，以及用于半自动生成深度学习模型标签，已开源提供Python实现

Abstract: Close-range laser scanning provides detailed 3D captures of forest stands but
requires efficient software for processing 3D point cloud data and extracting
individual trees. Although recent studies have introduced deep learning methods
for tree instance segmentation, these approaches require large annotated
datasets and substantial computational resources. As a resource-efficient
alternative, we present a revised version of the treeX algorithm, an
unsupervised method that combines clustering-based stem detection with region
growing for crown delineation. While the original treeX algorithm was developed
for personal laser scanning (PLS) data, we provide two parameter presets, one
for ground-based laser scanning (stationary terrestrial - TLS and PLS), and one
for UAV-borne laser scanning (ULS). We evaluated the method on six public
datasets (FOR-instance, ForestSemantic, LAUTx, NIBIO MLS, TreeLearn, Wytham
Woods) and compared it to six open-source methods (original treeX, treeiso,
RayCloudTools, ForAINet, SegmentAnyTree, TreeLearn). Compared to the original
treeX algorithm, our revision reduces runtime and improves accuracy, with
instance detection F$_1$-score gains of +0.11 to +0.49 for ground-based data.
For ULS data, our preset achieves an F$_1$-score of 0.58, whereas the original
algorithm fails to segment any correct instances. For TLS and PLS data, our
algorithm achieves accuracy similar to recent open-source methods, including
deep learning. Given its algorithmic design, we see two main applications for
our method: (1) as a resource-efficient alternative to deep learning approaches
in scenarios where the data characteristics align with the method design
(sufficient stem visibility and point density), and (2) for the semi-automatic
generation of labels for deep learning models. To enable broader adoption, we
provide an open-source Python implementation in the pointtree package.

*Hongpei Zheng,Lintao Xiang,Qijun Yang,Qian Lin,Hujun Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reg3D是一个创新的重建几何指令调优框架，通过将几何感知监督直接整合到训练过程中，解决了现有方法仅依赖文本监督的局限性，显著提升了3D场景理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型在2D视觉理解方面取得了显著进展，但扩展到3D场景理解仍面临挑战。现有方法主要依赖纯文本监督，无法提供学习稳健3D空间表示所需的几何约束。

Method: Reg3D采用双监督范式，在双编码器架构中设计互补的对象级和帧级重建任务，同时利用3D几何信息作为输入和显式学习目标，强制几何一致性以促进空间推理能力的发展。

Result: 在ScanQA、Scan2Cap、ScanRefer和SQA3D等数据集上的广泛实验表明，Reg3D带来了显著的性能改进。

Conclusion: Reg3D为空间感知多模态模型建立了一个新的训练范式，通过重建底层几何结构而非仅仅描述它们，实现了有效的3D理解。

Abstract: The rapid development of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has led to remarkable
progress in 2D visual understanding; however, extending these capabilities to
3D scene understanding remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on text-only supervision, which fails to provide the
geometric constraints required for learning robust 3D spatial representations.
In this paper, we introduce Reg3D, a novel Reconstructive Geometry Instruction
Tuning framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating geometry-aware
supervision directly into the training process. Our key insight is that
effective 3D understanding necessitates reconstructing underlying geometric
structures rather than merely describing them. Unlike existing methods that
inject 3D information solely at the input level, Reg3D adopts a
dual-supervision paradigm that leverages 3D geometric information both as input
and as explicit learning targets. Specifically, we design complementary
object-level and frame-level reconstruction tasks within a dual-encoder
architecture, enforcing geometric consistency to encourage the development of
spatial reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on ScanQA, Scan2Cap,
ScanRefer, and SQA3D demonstrate that Reg3D delivers substantial performance
improvements, establishing a new training paradigm for spatially aware
multimodal models.

Conclusion: 完全量化的多智能体中间融合系统在实际部署中具有可行性，为V2X协同感知的实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Cooperative perception through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication
offers significant potential for enhancing vehicle perception by mitigating
occlusions and expanding the field of view. However, past research has
predominantly focused on improving accuracy metrics without addressing the
crucial system-level considerations of efficiency, latency, and real-world
deployability. Noticeably, most existing systems rely on full-precision models,
which incur high computational and transmission costs, making them impractical
for real-time operation in resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we
introduce \textbf{QuantV2X}, the first fully quantized multi-agent system
designed specifically for efficient and scalable deployment of multi-modal,
multi-agent V2X cooperative perception. QuantV2X introduces a unified
end-to-end quantization strategy across both neural network models and
transmitted message representations that simultaneously reduces computational
load and transmission bandwidth. Remarkably, despite operating under low-bit
constraints, QuantV2X achieves accuracy comparable to full-precision systems.
More importantly, when evaluated under deployment-oriented metrics, QuantV2X
reduces system-level latency by 3.2$\times$ and achieves a +9.5 improvement in
mAP30 over full-precision baselines. Furthermore, QuantV2X scales more
effectively, enabling larger and more capable models to fit within strict
memory budgets. These results highlight the viability of a fully quantized
multi-agent intermediate fusion system for real-world deployment. The system
will be publicly released to promote research in this field:

Abstract: This study evaluates the efficacy of three deep learning architectures:
ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNetB0 for automated plant species
classification based on leaf venation patterns, a critical morphological
feature with high taxonomic relevance. Using the Swedish Leaf Dataset
comprising images from 15 distinct species (75 images per species, totalling
1,125 images), the models were demonstrated using standard performance metrics
during training and testing phases. ResNet50 achieved a training accuracy of
94.11% but exhibited overfitting, reflected by a reduced testing accuracy of
88.45% and an F1 score of 87.82%. MobileNetV2 demonstrated better
generalization capabilities, attaining a testing accuracy of 93.34% and an F1
score of 93.23%, indicating its suitability for lightweight, real-time
applications. EfficientNetB0 outperformed both models, achieving a testing
accuracy of 94.67% with precision, recall, and F1 scores exceeding 94.6%,
highlighting its robustness in venation-based classification. The findings
underscore the potential of deep learning, particularly EfficientNetB0, in
developing scalable and accurate tools for automated plant taxonomy using
venation traits.

TL;DR: LayoutGKN是一种更高效的图匹配方法，通过将跨图节点级交互推迟到联合嵌入架构的末端，使用可微分图核作为距离函数，在保持相似性计算性能的同时显著提升速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平面图通常表示为图结构以捕捉空间关系，现有的图匹配网络依赖昂贵的中间跨图节点级交互，导致推理时间缓慢

Method: 提出LayoutGKN方法，在联合嵌入架构的末端使用可微分图核作为距离函数来计算最终学习的节点级嵌入之间的距离

Result: LayoutGKN在相似性计算方面与图匹配网络相当或更好，同时显著提高了速度

Conclusion: LayoutGKN通过延迟跨图交互和使用图核距离函数，实现了高效且准确的图匹配，适用于搜索、聚类和数据可视化等应用

Abstract: Floor plans depict building layouts and are often represented as graphs to
capture the underlying spatial relationships. Comparison of these graphs is
critical for applications like search, clustering, and data visualization. The
most successful methods to compare graphs \ie, graph matching networks, rely on
costly intermediate cross-graph node-level interactions, therefore being slow
in inference time. We introduce \textbf{LayoutGKN}, a more efficient approach
that postpones the cross-graph node-level interactions to the end of the joint
embedding architecture. We do so by using a differentiable graph kernel as a
distance function on the final learned node-level embeddings. We show that
LayoutGKN computes similarity comparably or better than graph matching networks
while significantly increasing the speed.

Conclusion: CLIP-SVD提供了一种参数高效、性能优越的CLIP适应方法，能够更好地保持模型的泛化能力，同时提供可解释性分析。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown impressive zero-shot and
few-shot learning capabilities across diverse applications. However, adapting
these models to new fine-grained domains remains difficult due to reliance on
prompt engineering and the high cost of full model fine-tuning. Existing
adaptation approaches rely on augmented components, such as prompt tokens and
adapter modules, which could limit adaptation quality, destabilize the model,
and compromise the rich knowledge learned during pretraining. In this work, we
present \textbf{CLIP-SVD}, a novel \textit{multi-modal} and
\textit{parameter-efficient} adaptation technique that leverages Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to modify the internal parameter space of CLIP without
injecting additional modules. Specifically, we fine-tune only the singular
values of the CLIP parameter matrices to rescale the basis vectors for domain
adaptation while retaining the pretrained model. This design enables enhanced
adaptation performance using only \textbf{0.04\%} of the model's total
parameters and better preservation of its generalization ability. CLIP-SVD
achieves state-of-the-art classification results on 11 natural and 10
biomedical datasets, outperforming previous methods in both accuracy and
generalization under few-shot settings. Additionally, we leverage a natural
language-based approach to analyze the effectiveness and dynamics of the CLIP
adaptation to allow interpretability of CLIP-SVD. The code is publicly

TL;DR: 通过训练免费的神经网络架构搜索(DeepMAD)和新题的形状-纹理注意力模块(STAM)，STA-Net模型在边缘设备上实现了高精度植物病害诊断，准确度达89.00%，参数仅401K。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因对边缘设备部署高精度植物病害诊断模型的需求，以及现有轻量级网络中注意机制对植物病害细微特征(如不规则痕痕形状和复杂纹理)的损失问题。

Method: 1. 使用训练免费的神经网络架构搜索方法(DeepMAD)构建高效边缘网络背榜
2. 提出形状-纹理注意力模块(STAM)，通过可变形卷积(DCNv4)和Gabor滤波器分别处理形状和纹理特征
3. 在CCMT植物病害数据集上进行实验验证

Result: STA-Net模型在401K参数和51.1M FLOPs的计算复杂度下，达到了89.00%的准确度和88.96%的F1分数。分离实验证明STAM显著提升了基线和标准注意力模型的性能。

Conclusion: 通过基于领域知识的解耦注意力机制，为边缘部署的精准农业AI提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Responding to rising global food security needs, precision agriculture and
deep learning-based plant disease diagnosis have become crucial. Yet, deploying
high-precision models on edge devices is challenging. Most lightweight networks
use attention mechanisms designed for generic object recognition, which poorly
capture subtle pathological features like irregular lesion shapes and complex
textures. To overcome this, we propose a twofold solution: first, using a
training-free neural architecture search method (DeepMAD) to create an
efficient network backbone for edge devices; second, introducing the
Shape-Texture Attention Module (STAM). STAM splits attention into two branches
-- one using deformable convolutions (DCNv4) for shape awareness and the other
using a Gabor filter bank for texture awareness. On the public CCMT plant
disease dataset, our STA-Net model (with 401K parameters and 51.1M FLOPs)
reached 89.00% accuracy and an F1 score of 88.96%. Ablation studies confirm
STAM significantly improves performance over baseline and standard attention
models. Integrating domain knowledge via decoupled attention thus presents a
promising path for edge-deployed precision agriculture AI. The source code is

TL;DR: 提出了水下伪装目标检测任务(UCOD)和DeepCamo基准数据集，开发了SLENet框架，通过Gamma-非对称增强模块和定位引导分支提升检测性能，在多个数据集上验证了优越性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下伪装目标检测对海洋生态学至关重要，但受光学失真、水体浑浊和海洋生物复杂特征影响，该任务研究不足且检测精度受限

Method: 提出SLENet框架，包含Gamma-非对称增强(GAE)模块增强多尺度特征表示，定位引导分支(LGB)生成富含全局语义信息的位置图，多尺度监督解码器(MSSD)进行精确预测

Result: 在DeepCamo数据集和三个基准COD数据集上的实验证明SLENet优于现有最先进方法，并展现出对更广泛COD任务的高泛化性

Conclusion: SLENet为水下伪装目标检测提供了有效的解决方案，通过创新的特征增强和定位引导机制显著提升了检测精度和泛化能力

Abstract: Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection (UCOD) aims to identify objects that
blend seamlessly into underwater environments. This task is critically
important to marine ecology. However, it remains largely underexplored and
accurate identification is severely hindered by optical distortions, water
turbidity, and the complex traits of marine organisms. To address these
challenges, we introduce the UCOD task and present DeepCamo, a benchmark
dataset designed for this domain. We also propose Semantic Localization and
Enhancement Network (SLENet), a novel framework for UCOD. We first benchmark
state-of-the-art COD models on DeepCamo to reveal key issues, upon which SLENet
is built. In particular, we incorporate Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement (GAE)
module and a Localization Guidance Branch (LGB) to enhance multi-scale feature
representation while generating a location map enriched with global semantic
information. This map guides the Multi-Scale Supervised Decoder (MSSD) to
produce more accurate predictions. Experiments on our DeepCamo dataset and
three benchmark COD datasets confirm SLENet's superior performance over SOTA
methods, and underscore its high generality for the broader COD task.

TL;DR: 通过利用视频序列的时间归纳偏置，提出了一种无需改变网络结构的训练策略，显著提升了图像漩散模型的收敛速度、生成质量和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像漩散模型仅在独立静态图像上训练，这种方式在捕捉时间序列信息时存在本质性限制，导致收敛慢、分布覆盖局限和一般化能力下降。

Method: 提出一种简单有效的训练策略，利用连续视频帧中的时间归纳偏置来改善漩散训练，无需任何网络结构修改，可无缝集成到标准漩散训练流程中。

Result: 在HandCo数据集上评估显示：收敛速度提升2倍以上，在训练和验证集上均获得更低的FID分数，同时提高了生成的多样性。优化分析显示该正则化方法减少了梯度方差，促进更快收敛。

Conclusion: 通过利用视频序列的时间信息，可以显著改善图像漩散模型的训练效果，这为提升生成模型性能提供了一种简单有效的方法。

Abstract: Image diffusion models are trained on independently sampled static images.
While this is the bedrock task protocol in generative modeling, capturing the
temporal world through the lens of static snapshots is information-deficient by
design. This limitation leads to slower convergence, limited distributional
coverage, and reduced generalization. In this work, we propose a simple and
effective training strategy that leverages the temporal inductive bias present
in continuous video frames to improve diffusion training. Notably, the proposed
method requires no architectural modification and can be seamlessly integrated
into standard diffusion training pipelines. We evaluate our method on the
HandCo dataset, where hand-object interactions exhibit dense temporal coherence
and subtle variations in finger articulation often result in semantically
distinct motions. Empirically, our method accelerates convergence by over
2$\text{x}$ faster and achieves lower FID on both training and validation
distributions. It also improves generative diversity by encouraging the model
to capture meaningful temporal variations. We further provide an optimization
analysis showing that our regularization reduces the gradient variance, which
contributes to faster convergence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedVista3D是一个用于3D CT分析的多尺度语义增强视觉语言预训练框架，通过局部和全局图像-文本对齐解决放射诊断中的漏读错误和沟通失败问题，在多个任务上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射诊断错误（漏读错误、注意盲区和沟通失败）在临床实践中仍然普遍存在，特别是在3D成像中，医生需要检查数百个切片。现有3D视觉语言模型无法同时满足精确局部检测、全局体积级推理和语义一致的自然语言报告需求。

Method: MedVista3D采用多尺度语义增强视觉语言预训练框架，进行局部和全局图像-文本对齐以实现细粒度表示学习。通过语言模型重写和引入放射学语义匹配库来解决报告变异性问题。

Result: MedVista3D在零样本疾病分类、报告检索和医学视觉问答方面达到最先进性能，同时在器官分割和预后预测任务上表现良好。

Conclusion: MedVista3D通过联合局部-全局理解和语义感知对齐，有效解决了3D放射诊断中的关键挑战，为临床实践提供了强大的辅助诊断工具。

Abstract: Radiologic diagnostic errors-under-reading errors, inattentional blindness,
and communication failures-remain prevalent in clinical practice. These issues
often stem from missed localized abnormalities, limited global context, and
variability in report language. These challenges are amplified in 3D imaging,
where clinicians must examine hundreds of slices per scan. Addressing them
requires systems with precise localized detection, global volume-level
reasoning, and semantically consistent natural language reporting. However,
existing 3D vision-language models are unable to meet all three needs jointly,
lacking local-global understanding for spatial reasoning and struggling with
the variability and noise of uncurated radiology reports. We present
MedVista3D, a multi-scale semantic-enriched vision-language pretraining
framework for 3D CT analysis. To enable joint disease detection and holistic
interpretation, MedVista3D performs local and global image-text alignment for
fine-grained representation learning within full-volume context. To address
report variability, we apply language model rewrites and introduce a Radiology
Semantic Matching Bank for semantics-aware alignment. MedVista3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot disease classification, report
retrieval, and medical visual question answering, while transferring well to
organ segmentation and prognosis prediction. Code and datasets will be
released.

TL;DR: CaPL是一种基于因果推理的视觉粒度化文本提示学习方法，通过属性解耦和粒度学习模块，显著提升了CLIP在细粒度识别任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CLIP提示学习方法在处理细粒度数据集时表现有限，需要一种能够捕捉类别间细微差异的方法。

Method: 提出两个模块：1）属性解耦模块使用布朗桥扩散模型将视觉特征分解为共享属性和特定属性；2）粒度学习模块通过因果推理策略整合属性构建视觉粒度。

Result: 在15个数据集上的实验表明，CaPL方法显著优于最先进的提示学习方法，特别是在细粒度数据集上。

Conclusion: 通过视觉粒度化和因果推理，CaPL成功提升了CLIP在细粒度识别任务中的性能，为提示学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Prompt learning has recently attracted much attention for adapting
pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) to downstream recognition
tasks. However, most of the existing CLIP-based prompt learning methods only
show a limited ability for handling fine-grained datasets. To address this
issue, we propose a causality-guided text prompt learning method via visual
granulation for CLIP, called CaPL, where the explored visual granulation
technique could construct sets of visual granules for the text prompt to
capture subtle discrepancies among different fine-grained classes through
casual inference. The CaPL method contains the following two modules: (1) An
attribute disentanglement module is proposed to decompose visual features into
non-individualized attributes (shared by some classes) and individualized
attributes (specific to single classes) using a Brownian Bridge Diffusion
Model; (2) A granule learning module is proposed to construct visual granules
by integrating the aforementioned attributes for recognition under two causal
inference strategies. Thanks to the learned visual granules, more
discriminative text prompt is expected to be learned. Extensive experimental
results on 15 datasets demonstrate that our CaPL method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art prompt learning methods, especially on
fine-grained datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于事件相机的事件幸运融合方法（EGTM），通过事件流的时空分布来提取像素级无湍流指导，显著提升了湍流消除的效率和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的湍流消除方法需要从有限帧率的同步帧中学习粗粒度的湍流动态，计算和存储效率低下。事件相机具有微秒级时间分辨率，可以通过稀疏异步成像机制从根本上解决这一瓶颈。

Method: 提出了"事件幸运洞察"理论，揭示了湍流畸变与事件流逆时空分布的关联性。基于此构建了EGTM框架，从显式但嘈杂的湍流事件中提取像素级可靠的湍流自由指导进行时间幸运融合。

Result: 方法在模型大小、推理延迟和模型复杂度方面分别比现有SOTA方法提升了710倍、214倍和224倍，同时在真实世界EGTM数据集上实现了最先进的恢复质量（PSNR +0.94，SSIM +0.08）。

Conclusion: 将事件模态引入湍流消除任务具有显著的效率优势，事件相机的高时间分辨率和稀疏成像特性为湍流消除提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Turbulence mitigation (TM) aims to remove the stochastic distortions and
blurs introduced by atmospheric turbulence into frame cameras. Existing
state-of-the-art deep-learning TM methods extract turbulence cues from multiple
degraded frames to find the so-called "lucky'', not distorted patch, for "lucky
fusion''. However, it requires high-capacity network to learn from
coarse-grained turbulence dynamics between synchronous frames with limited
frame-rate, thus fall short in computational and storage efficiency. Event
cameras, with microsecond-level temporal resolution, have the potential to
fundamentally address this bottleneck with efficient sparse and asynchronous
imaging mechanism. In light of this, we (i) present the fundamental
\textbf{``event-lucky insight''} to reveal the correlation between turbulence
distortions and inverse spatiotemporal distribution of event streams. Then,
build upon this insight, we (ii) propose a novel EGTM framework that extracts
pixel-level reliable turbulence-free guidance from the explicit but noisy
turbulent events for temporal lucky fusion. Moreover, we (iii) build the first
turbulence data acquisition system to contribute the first real-world
event-driven TM dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly surpass the existing SOTA TM method by 710 times, 214
times and 224 times in model size, inference latency and model complexity
respectively, while achieving the state-of-the-art in restoration quality
(+0.94 PSNR and +0.08 SSIM) on our real-world EGTM dataset. This demonstrating
the great efficiency merit of introducing event modality into TM task. Demo
code and data have been uploaded in supplementary material and will be released
once accepted.

TL;DR: FocusMamba通过事件引导的多模态稀疏化和跨模态聚焦融合，在RGB-事件检测中实现了精度和效率的平衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB-事件检测方法在处理低信息区域时存在计算冗余和性能不佳的问题，需要自适应稀疏化策略

Method: 提出事件引导多模态稀疏化(EGMS)策略和跨模态聚焦融合(CMFF)模块，自适应丢弃低信息区域并有效整合互补特征

Result: 在DSEC-Det和PKU-DAVIS-SOD数据集上相比现有方法在精度和效率方面都取得了优越性能

Conclusion: FocusMamba通过自适应协作稀疏化和高效信息整合，为RGB-事件检测提供了更好的精度-效率平衡解决方案

Abstract: Existing RGB-Event detection methods process the low-information regions of
both modalities (background in images and non-event regions in event data)
uniformly during feature extraction and fusion, resulting in high computational
costs and suboptimal performance. To mitigate the computational redundancy
during feature extraction, researchers have respectively proposed token
sparsification methods for the image and event modalities. However, these
methods employ a fixed number or threshold for token selection, hindering the
retention of informative tokens for samples with varying complexity. To achieve
a better balance between accuracy and efficiency, we propose FocusMamba, which
performs adaptive collaborative sparsification of multimodal features and
efficiently integrates complementary information. Specifically, an Event-Guided
Multimodal Sparsification (EGMS) strategy is designed to identify and
adaptively discard low-information regions within each modality by leveraging
scene content changes perceived by the event camera. Based on the
sparsification results, a Cross-Modality Focus Fusion (CMFF) module is proposed
to effectively capture and integrate complementary features from both
modalities. Experiments on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves superior performance in both accuracy and
efficiency compared to existing methods. The code will be available at

Motivation: 食物识别受到广泛关注，但新菜品的快速涌现需要能够识别未见食物类别的方法，这推动了零样本食物学习的发展

Method: 提出SalientFusion方法，包含SalientFormer（去除背景冗余，利用深度特征解决角色混淆）和DebiasAT（通过对齐提示与视觉特征减少语义偏差）两个组件

Result: 在提出的CZSFood-90和CZSFood-164基准上取得state-of-the-art结果，同时在通用CZSL数据集上也表现最佳

Conclusion: SalientFusion方法有效解决了CZSFR任务中的三大挑战，为组合零样本食物识别提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Food recognition has gained significant attention, but the rapid emergence of
new dishes requires methods for recognizing unseen food categories, motivating
Zero-Shot Food Learning (ZSFL). We propose the task of Compositional Zero-Shot
Food Recognition (CZSFR), where cuisines and ingredients naturally align with
attributes and objects in Compositional Zero-Shot learning (CZSL). However,
CZSFR faces three challenges: (1) Redundant background information distracts
models from learning meaningful food features, (2) Role confusion between
staple and side dishes leads to misclassification, and (3) Semantic bias in a
single attribute can lead to confusion of understanding. Therefore, we propose
SalientFusion, a context-aware CZSFR method with two components: SalientFormer,
which removes background redundancy and uses depth features to resolve role
confusion; DebiasAT, which reduces the semantic bias by aligning prompts with
visual features. Using our proposed benchmarks, CZSFood-90 and CZSFood-164, we
show that SalientFusion achieves state-of-the-art results on these benchmarks
and the most popular general datasets for the general CZSL. The code is
avaliable at https://github.com/Jiajun-RUC/SalientFusion.

Motivation: 现有的自回归方法在占用世界模型中存在效率低下、长期生成时出现时间退化以及缺乏可控性等问题，需要一种更有效的解决方案。

Method: 将占用世界模型重新表述为时间下一尺度预测(TENS)任务，使用TensFormer管理时间因果关系和空间关系，并提出整体姿态聚合策略来增强姿态可控性。

Result: 实验表明OccTENS在占用质量和推理时间方面均优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: OccTENS通过创新的TENS框架有效解决了占用世界模型中的关键挑战，实现了高效、可控且高质量的长期占用生成。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose OccTENS, a generative occupancy world model that
enables controllable, high-fidelity long-term occupancy generation while
maintaining computational efficiency. Different from visual generation, the
occupancy world model must capture the fine-grained 3D geometry and dynamic
evolution of the 3D scenes, posing great challenges for the generative models.
Recent approaches based on autoregression (AR) have demonstrated the potential
to predict vehicle movement and future occupancy scenes simultaneously from
historical observations, but they typically suffer from \textbf{inefficiency},
\textbf{temporal degradation} in long-term generation and \textbf{lack of
controllability}. To holistically address these issues, we reformulate the
occupancy world model as a temporal next-scale prediction (TENS) task, which
decomposes the temporal sequence modeling problem into the modeling of spatial
scale-by-scale generation and temporal scene-by-scene prediction. With a
\textbf{TensFormer}, OccTENS can effectively manage the temporal causality and
spatial relationships of occupancy sequences in a flexible and scalable way. To
enhance the pose controllability, we further propose a holistic pose
aggregation strategy, which features a unified sequence modeling for occupancy
and ego-motion. Experiments show that OccTENS outperforms the state-of-the-art
method with both higher occupancy quality and faster inference time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在不同类别对象之间建立密集对应关系对于形状重建和机器人操作等任务很重要。对象的功能（即对象对其他对象的影响）可以指导对应关系的建立，因为实现特定功能的对象部件通常在形状和外观上具有相似性。

Method: 提出弱监督学习范式：1）利用视觉语言模型对多视角图像进行伪标注获取功能部件；2）结合密集对比学习从像素对应关系中提取功能和空间知识；3）构建新的模型来建立密集功能对应关系。

Result: 构建了合成和真实评估数据集作为任务基准，实验结果表明该方法优于由现成的自监督图像表示和基于视觉语言模型组成的基线解决方案。

Conclusion: 通过利用视觉语言模型和多视角对比学习，成功建立了跨类别的密集功能对应关系，为形状重建和机器人操作等应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Establishing dense correspondences across image pairs is essential for tasks
such as shape reconstruction and robot manipulation. In the challenging setting
of matching across different categories, the function of an object, i.e., the
effect that an object can cause on other objects, can guide how correspondences
should be established. This is because object parts that enable specific
functions often share similarities in shape and appearance. We derive the
definition of dense functional correspondence based on this observation and
propose a weakly-supervised learning paradigm to tackle the prediction task.
The main insight behind our approach is that we can leverage vision-language
models to pseudo-label multi-view images to obtain functional parts. We then
integrate this with dense contrastive learning from pixel correspondences to
distill both functional and spatial knowledge into a new model that can
establish dense functional correspondence. Further, we curate synthetic and
real evaluation datasets as task benchmarks. Our results demonstrate the
advantages of our approach over baseline solutions consisting of off-the-shelf
self-supervised image representations and grounded vision language models.

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models excel in zero-shot image recognition but
face challenges in few-shot scenarios due to computationally intensive offline
fine-tuning using prompt learning, which risks overfitting. To overcome these

framework that enhances CLIP's adaptability via a dual attention mechanism. Our
design incorporates dataset-specific information through two components: the
Memory Attn-Adapter, which refines category embeddings using support examples,
and the Local-Global Attn-Adapter, which enriches image embeddings by
integrating local and global features. This architecture enables dynamic
adaptation from a few labeled samples without retraining the base model.
Attn-Adapter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-category and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标存在缺陷：n-gram指标无法捕捉语义正确性，表示相似性指标计算成本高且与人类判断相关性低，LLM指标虽然相关性强但计算成本过高，不适合模型开发中的迭代评估。

Method: 基于CLIP模型进行改进，引入新的目标函数来增强特异性，奖励正确的细节描述并惩罚错误的描述，从而构建SPECS指标。

Result: SPECS在相关性方面与开源LLM指标相当，但计算效率显著更高，能够有效支持图像描述模型开发中的迭代检查点评估。

Conclusion: SPECS提供了一个实用高效的替代方案，解决了长图像描述评估中准确性、相关性和效率之间的平衡问题。

Abstract: As interest grows in generating long, detailed image captions, standard
evaluation metrics become increasingly unreliable. N-gram-based metrics though
efficient, fail to capture semantic correctness. Representational Similarity
(RS) metrics, designed to address this, initially saw limited use due to high
computational costs, while today, despite advances in hardware, they remain
unpopular due to low correlation to human judgments. Meanwhile, metrics based
on large language models (LLMs) show strong correlation with human judgments,
but remain too expensive for iterative use during model development.
  We introduce SPECS (Specificity-Enhanced CLIPScore), a reference-free RS
metric tailored to long image captioning. SPECS modifies CLIP with a new
objective that emphasizes specificity: rewarding correct details and penalizing
incorrect ones. We show that SPECS matches the performance of open-source
LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments, while being far more
efficient. This makes it a practical alternative for iterative checkpoint
evaluation during image captioning model development.Our code can be found at

Abstract: The scarcity of well-annotated diverse medical images is a major hurdle for
developing reliable AI models in healthcare. Substantial technical advances
have been made in generative foundation models for natural images. Here we
develop `ChexGen', a generative vision-language foundation model that
introduces a unified framework for text-, mask-, and bounding box-guided
synthesis of chest radiographs. Built upon the latent diffusion transformer
architecture, ChexGen was pretrained on the largest curated chest X-ray dataset
to date, consisting of 960,000 radiograph-report pairs. ChexGen achieves
accurate synthesis of radiographs through expert evaluations and quantitative
metrics. We demonstrate the utility of ChexGen for training data augmentation
and supervised pretraining, which led to performance improvements across
disease classification, detection, and segmentation tasks using a small
fraction of training data. Further, our model enables the creation of diverse
patient cohorts that enhance model fairness by detecting and mitigating

*Xihua Sheng,Yingwen Zhang,Long Xu,Shiqi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种绘图学习的多视角视频编码框架(LMVC)，通过利用视图间运动和内容相关性来提高压缩效率，支持随机访问和向后兼容性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视角视频作为体积视频的关键数据源，存储和传输面临巨大数据量挑战，而现有深度学习编码方法多专注于单视角或立体视频，多视角场景研究不足。

Method: 提出基于特征的视图间运动向量预测方法，利用解码的独立视图运动特征来条件化依赖视图运动编码；提出无视差视图间上下文预测模块，从解码的独立视图内容特征预测视图间上下文；配合视图间运动和上下文的权重模型。

Abstract: Multiview video is a key data source for volumetric video, enabling immersive
3D scene reconstruction but posing significant challenges in storage and
transmission due to its massive data volume. Recently, deep learning-based
end-to-end video coding has achieved great success, yet most focus on
single-view or stereo videos, leaving general multiview scenarios
underexplored. This paper proposes an end-to-end learned multiview video coding
(LMVC) framework that ensures random access and backward compatibility while
enhancing compression efficiency. Our key innovation lies in effectively
leveraging independent-view motion and content information to enhance
dependent-view compression. Specifically, to exploit the inter-view motion
correlation, we propose a feature-based inter-view motion vector prediction
method that conditions dependent-view motion encoding on decoded
independent-view motion features, along with an inter-view motion entropy model
that learns inter-view motion priors. To exploit the inter-view content
correlation, we propose a disparity-free inter-view context prediction module
that predicts inter-view contexts from decoded independent-view content
features, combined with an inter-view contextual entropy model that captures
inter-view context priors. Experimental results show that our proposed LMVC
framework outperforms the reference software of the traditional MV-HEVC
standard by a large margin, establishing a strong baseline for future research
in this field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TopoSculpt是一个用于3D细粒度管状结构拓扑优化的框架，通过整体建模、拓扑完整性约束和课程精炼方案，显著改善了医学管状解剖结构的几何和拓扑重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖体素重叠度量，无法捕捉拓扑正确性和完整性，且拓扑感知损失通常应用于局部补丁，无法保证全局拓扑保持和推理时的几何错误修正。

Method: 采用整体区域建模策略捕获完整空间上下文；引入拓扑完整性Betti约束联合执行Betti数先验和全局完整性；使用持久同调课程精炼方案从粗到细逐步修正错误。

Result: 在肺气道和Willis环数据集上，β₀错误分别从69.00降至3.40和从1.65降至0.30，树长度检测和分支检测率提升近10%。

Conclusion: TopoSculpt能有效修正关键拓扑错误，推进复杂3D管状解剖结构的高保真建模。

Abstract: Medical tubular anatomical structures are inherently three-dimensional
conduits with lumens, enclosing walls, and complex branching topologies.
Accurate reconstruction of their geometry and topology is crucial for
applications such as bronchoscopic navigation and cerebral arterial
connectivity assessment. Existing methods often rely on voxel-wise overlap
measures, which fail to capture topological correctness and completeness.
Although topology-aware losses and persistent homology constraints have shown
promise, they are usually applied patch-wise and cannot guarantee global
preservation or correct geometric errors at inference. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel TopoSculpt, a framework for topological
refinement of 3D fine-grained tubular structures. TopoSculpt (i) adopts a
holistic whole-region modeling strategy to capture full spatial context, (ii)
first introduces a Topological Integrity Betti (TIB) constraint that jointly
enforces Betti number priors and global integrity, and (iii) employs a
curriculum refinement scheme with persistent homology to progressively correct
errors from coarse to fine scales. Extensive experiments on challenging
pulmonary airway and Circle of Willis datasets demonstrate substantial
improvements in both geometry and topology. For instance, $\beta_{0}$ errors
are reduced from 69.00 to 3.40 on the airway dataset and from 1.65 to 0.30 on
the CoW dataset, with Tree length detected and branch detected rates improving
by nearly 10\%. These results highlight the effectiveness of TopoSculpt in
correcting critical topological errors and advancing the high-fidelity modeling
of complex 3D tubular anatomy. The project homepage is available at:

Method: 构建了一个基于U-Net网络结构的深度学习流水线，采用EfficientNet-B4作为编码器，在SIIM-ACR数据集上进行训练，使用数据增帽和二元交叉瑣加Dice损失的组合损失函数

Result: 在独立的PTX-498数据集上，模型达到了IoU 0.7008和Dice分数0.8241的高性能指标，显示出在气胸区域分割任务上的准确性

Abstract: Pneumothorax, the abnormal accumulation of air in the pleural space, can be
life-threatening if undetected. Chest X-rays are the first-line diagnostic
tool, but small cases may be subtle. We propose an automated deep-learning
pipeline using a U-Net with an EfficientNet-B4 encoder to segment pneumothorax
regions. Trained on the SIIM-ACR dataset with data augmentation and a combined
binary cross-entropy plus Dice loss, the model achieved an IoU of 0.7008 and

demonstrate that the model can accurately localize pneumothoraces and support

*Zhu Wenjie,Zhang Yabin,Xin Jin,Wenjun Zeng,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出自适应负文本空间(ANTS)方法，利用多模态大语言模型的理解和推理能力，通过生成表达性负句子来精确表征OOD分布，提升远OOD检测；针对近OOD场景生成视觉相似的负标签，减少假阴性；设计自适应加权分数平衡两种负文本空间，在ImageNet基准上FPR95降低4.2%，达到新SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有负标签方法缺乏对OOD图像的理解，难以构建准确的负空间，且假阴性标签会显著降低近OOD性能。

Method: 利用MLLMs识别可能为OOD样本的图像并生成表达性负句子；针对近OOD场景识别视觉相似的ID类别子集，生成定制化负标签；设计自适应加权分数平衡两种负文本空间。

Result: 在ImageNet基准上显著降低FPR95达4.2%，建立新的最先进性能；方法无需训练且零样本，具有高可扩展性。

Conclusion: ANTS方法通过MLLMs的理解和推理能力有效解决了OOD检测中的负空间构建问题，在远OOD和近OOD场景中都表现出色，具有很好的适应性和可扩展性。

Abstract: The introduction of negative labels (NLs) has proven effective in enhancing
Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. However, existing methods often lack an
understanding of OOD images, making it difficult to construct an accurate
negative space. In addition, the presence of false negative labels
significantly degrades their near-OOD performance. To address these issues, we
propose shaping an Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) by leveraging the
understanding and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Specifically, we identify images likely to be OOD samples as negative
images and prompt the MLLM to describe these images, generating expressive
negative sentences that precisely characterize the OOD distribution and enhance
far-OOD detection. For the near-OOD setting, where OOD samples resemble the
in-distribution (ID) subset, we first identify the subset of ID classes that
are visually similar to negative images and then leverage the reasoning
capability of MLLMs to generate visually similar negative labels tailored to
this subset, effectively reducing false negatives and improving near-OOD
detection. To balance these two types of negative textual spaces, we design an
adaptive weighted score that enables the method to handle different OOD task
settings (near-OOD and far-OOD) without relying on task-specific prior
knowledge, making it highly adaptable in open environments. On the ImageNet
benchmark, our ANTS significantly reduces the FPR95 by 4.2\%, establishing a
new state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our method is training-free and zero-shot,
enabling high scalability.

TL;DR: MMChange是一个多模态遥感变化检测方法，结合图像和文本模态，通过图像特征细化、文本差异增强和跨模态融合模块，显著提升了变化检测的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法仅依赖图像模态，在特征表示、变化模式建模和泛化能力方面存在局限，特别是在光照和噪声干扰下表现不佳。

Method: 提出图像特征细化模块突出关键区域并抑制环境噪声；使用视觉语言模型生成双时相图像的语义描述；设计文本差异增强模块捕获细粒度语义变化；开发图像-文本特征融合模块实现深度跨模态集成。

Result: 在LEVIRCD、WHUCD和SYSUCD数据集上的大量实验表明，MMChange在多个指标上持续超越最先进方法。

Conclusion: MMChange通过多模态融合有效提升了遥感变化检测的性能，验证了其在多模态遥感变化检测中的有效性。

Abstract: Although deep learning has advanced remote sensing change detection (RSCD),
most methods rely solely on image modality, limiting feature representation,
change pattern modeling, and generalization especially under illumination and
noise disturbances. To address this, we propose MMChange, a multimodal RSCD
method that combines image and text modalities to enhance accuracy and
robustness. An Image Feature Refinement (IFR) module is introduced to highlight
key regions and suppress environmental noise. To overcome the semantic
limitations of image features, we employ a vision language model (VLM) to
generate semantic descriptions of bitemporal images. A Textual Difference
Enhancement (TDE) module then captures fine grained semantic shifts, guiding
the model toward meaningful changes. To bridge the heterogeneity between
modalities, we design an Image Text Feature Fusion (ITFF) module that enables
deep cross modal integration. Extensive experiments on LEVIRCD, WHUCD, and
SYSUCD demonstrate that MMChange consistently surpasses state of the art
methods across multiple metrics, validating its effectiveness for multimodal
RSCD. Code is available at: https://github.com/yikuizhai/MMChange.

TL;DR: SAC-MIL是一种用于WSI分类的空间感知相关多实例学习方法，通过位置编码模块和SAC块实现全实例相关性计算，在多个数据集上达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决WSI分类中空间信息利用不足和计算复杂度高的问题，特别是Transformer方法需要定制CUDA内核的部署困难

Method: 使用位置编码模块编码实例坐标空间关系，SAC块基于MLP实现线性时间复杂度的全实例相关性计算

Result: 在CAMELYON-16、TCGA-LUNG和TCGA-BRAC数据集上取得了最先进的性能

Conclusion: SAC-MIL提供了一种高效且易于部署的WSI分类方法，解决了序列长度外推问题，无需定制CUDA内核

Abstract: We propose Spatial-Aware Correlated Multiple Instance Learning (SAC-MIL) for
performing WSI classification. SAC-MIL consists of a positional encoding module
to encode position information and a SAC block to perform full instance
correlations. The positional encoding module utilizes the instance coordinates
within the slide to encode the spatial relationships instead of the instance
index in the input WSI sequence. The positional encoding module can also handle
the length extrapolation issue where the training and testing sequences have
different lengths. The SAC block is an MLP-based method that performs full
instance correlation in linear time complexity with respect to the sequence
length. Due to the simple structure of MLP, it is easy to deploy since it does
not require custom CUDA kernels, compared to Transformer-based methods for WSI
classification. SAC-MIL has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the
CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

Motivation: 解决无对比剂肝脏MRI血管分割的挑战，对比增强影像序列不但统一采集，而无对比剂影像更常见但分割困难且需要大量标注数据

Method: 多任务学习框架，在训练期间利用成对的无对比剂和对比增强MRI数据（有无血管标注均可）进行模型训练，通过共享任务结构改善特征表征

Result: 辅助数据显著提高了血管分割准确度，即使在推理时不可用。在标注数据少时效果最为明显，该方法在脑绕分割任务中也得到验证

Conclusion: 辅助性信息影像模态可以在仅于训练期可用的情况下增强专家标注的效果，为区域分割任务提供了有效的数据增强方案

Abstract: Liver vessel segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging data is important for
the computational analysis of vascular remodelling, associated with a wide
spectrum of diffuse liver diseases. Existing approaches rely on contrast
enhanced imaging data, but the necessary dedicated imaging sequences are not
uniformly acquired. Images without contrast enhancement are acquired more
frequently, but vessel segmentation is challenging, and requires large-scale
annotated data. We propose a multi-task learning framework to segment vessels
in liver MRI without contrast. It exploits auxiliary contrast enhanced MRI data
available only during training to reduce the need for annotated training
examples. Our approach draws on paired native and contrast enhanced data with
and without vessel annotations for model training. Results show that auxiliary
data improves the accuracy of vessel segmentation, even if they are not
available during inference. The advantage is most pronounced if only few
annotations are available for training, since the feature representation
benefits from the shared task structure. A validation of this approach to
augment a model for brain tumor segmentation confirms its benefits across
different domains. An auxiliary informative imaging modality can augment expert
annotations even if it is only available during training.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型多模态模型在多项选择题回答中的提示词敏感性，发现微小提示词变化可导致15%的准确率差异，提出了Promptception框架系统评估提示词敏感性，并为不同模型类型提供了提示词设计原则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型在多项选择题回答中的提示词设计缺乏系统研究，提示词的微小变化会导致模型性能显著波动，这影响了模型评估的透明性和公平性。

Method: 提出了Promptception框架，包含61种提示词类型、15个类别和6个大类，用于评估10个不同规模的大型多模态模型在3个多项选择题基准测试上的表现。

Result: 研究发现专有模型对提示词语义更敏感，开源模型表现更稳定但难以处理复杂提示词；提示词变化可导致高达15%的准确率差异。

Conclusion: 需要针对专有和开源模型制定不同的提示词设计原则，以实现更稳健和公平的模型评估，提示词敏感性是评估大型多模态模型性能的重要维度。

Abstract: Despite the success of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in recent years, prompt
design for LMMs in Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) remains poorly
understood. We show that even minor variations in prompt phrasing and structure
can lead to accuracy deviations of up to 15% for certain prompts and models.
This variability poses a challenge for transparent and fair LMM evaluation, as
models often report their best-case performance using carefully selected
prompts. To address this, we introduce Promptception, a systematic framework
for evaluating prompt sensitivity in LMMs. It consists of 61 prompt types,
spanning 15 categories and 6 supercategories, each targeting specific aspects
of prompt formulation, and is used to evaluate 10 LMMs ranging from lightweight
open-source models to GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, across 3 MCQA benchmarks:
MMStar, MMMU-Pro, MVBench. Our findings reveal that proprietary models exhibit
greater sensitivity to prompt phrasing, reflecting tighter alignment with
instruction semantics, while open-source models are steadier but struggle with
nuanced and complex phrasing. Based on this analysis, we propose Prompting
Principles tailored to proprietary and open-source LMMs, enabling more robust
and fair model evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D语义占据预测方法在处理体素特征时忽视高度轴信息，传统通道注意力对所有高度层赋予相同权重，限制了不同高度特征的差异化表达能力

Method: 使用全局和局部垂直切片提取高度轴体素特征；全局局部融合模块协调细粒度空间细节和整体上下文信息；SEAttention3D模块通过平均池化保持高度分辨率并为每个高度层分配动态通道注意力权重

Result: 在nuScenes-SurroundOcc和nuScenes-OpenOccupancy数据集上显著提升平均IoU，特别在小物体类别上取得明显增益

Conclusion: SliceSemOcc框架通过垂直切片和高度感知的注意力机制有效提升了3D语义占据预测性能，特别是在捕捉垂直维度语义变化方面表现出色

Abstract: Driven by autonomous driving's demands for precise 3D perception, 3D semantic
occupancy prediction has become a pivotal research topic. Unlike
bird's-eye-view (BEV) methods, which restrict scene representation to a 2D
plane, occupancy prediction leverages a complete 3D voxel grid to model spatial
structures in all dimensions, thereby capturing semantic variations along the
vertical axis. However, most existing approaches overlook height-axis
information when processing voxel features. And conventional SENet-style
channel attention assigns uniform weight across all height layers, limiting
their ability to emphasize features at different heights. To address these
limitations, we propose SliceSemOcc, a novel vertical slice based multimodal
framework for 3D semantic occupancy representation. Specifically, we extract
voxel features along the height-axis using both global and local vertical
slices. Then, a global local fusion module adaptively reconciles fine-grained
spatial details with holistic contextual information. Furthermore, we propose
the SEAttention3D module, which preserves height-wise resolution through
average pooling and assigns dynamic channel attention weights to each height
layer. Extensive experiments on nuScenes-SurroundOcc and nuScenes-OpenOccupancy
datasets verify that our method significantly enhances mean IoU, achieving
especially pronounced gains on most small-object categories. Detailed ablation
studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed SliceSemOcc
framework.

Abstract: Due to their powerful feature association capabilities, neural network-based
computer vision models have the ability to detect and exploit unintended
patterns within the data, potentially leading to correct predictions based on
incorrect or unintended but statistically relevant signals. These clues may
vary from simple color aberrations to small texts within the image. In
situations where these unintended signals align with the predictive task,
models can mistakenly link these features with the task and rely on them for
making predictions. This phenomenon is referred to as spurious correlations,
where patterns appear to be associated with the task but are actually
coincidental. As a result, detection and mitigation of spurious correlations
have become crucial tasks for building trustworthy, reliable, and generalizable
machine learning models. In this work, we present a novel method to detect
spurious correlations in vision transformers, a type of neural network
architecture that gained significant popularity in recent years. Using both
supervised and self-supervised trained models, we present large-scale
experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrating the ability of the proposed
method to identify spurious correlations. We also find that, even if the same
architecture is used, the training methodology has a significant impact on the
model's reliance on spurious correlations. Furthermore, we show that certain
classes in the ImageNet dataset contain spurious signals that are easily
detected by the models and discuss the underlying reasons for those spurious
signals. In light of our findings, we provide an exhaustive list of the
aforementioned images and call for caution in their use in future research
efforts. Lastly, we present a case study investigating spurious signals in
invasive breast mass classification, grounding our work in real-world
scenarios.

Conclusion: LML是一个有价值的多类多实例学习问题，提出的计数网络和MPEM模块能够有效地解决该问题，在多个应用领域具有应用潜力。

Abstract: The paper proposes a novel multi-class Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL)
problem called Learning from Majority Label (LML). In LML, the majority class
of instances in a bag is assigned as the bag-level label. The goal of LML is to
train a classification model that estimates the class of each instance using
the majority label. This problem is valuable in a variety of applications,
including pathology image segmentation, political voting prediction, customer
sentiment analysis, and environmental monitoring. To solve LML, we propose a
Counting Network trained to produce bag-level majority labels, estimated by
counting the number of instances in each class. Furthermore, analysis
experiments on the characteristics of LML revealed that bags with a high
proportion of the majority class facilitate learning. Based on this result, we
developed a Majority Proportion Enhancement Module (MPEM) that increases the
proportion of the majority class by removing minority class instances within
the bags. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method on
four datasets compared to conventional MIL methods. Moreover, ablation studies
confirmed the effectiveness of each module. The code is available at

Abstract: In the frontier research and application of current video surveillance
technology, traditional camera systems exhibit significant limitations of
response delay exceeding 200 ms in dynamic scenarios due to the insufficient
deep feature extraction capability of automatic recognition algorithms and the
efficiency bottleneck of computing architectures, failing to meet the real-time

heterogeneous computing architecture based on Phytium processors and Cambricon
accelerator cards, constructing a UAV tracking and gazing system with
millisecond-level response capability. At the hardware level, the system adopts
a collaborative computing architecture of Phytium FT-2000/4 processors and
MLU220 accelerator cards, enhancing computing power through multi-card
parallelism. At the software level, it innovatively integrates a lightweight
YOLOv5s detection network with a DeepSORT cascaded tracking algorithm, forming
a closed-loop control chain of "detection-tracking-feedback". Experimental
results demonstrate that the system achieves a stable single-frame
comprehensive processing delay of 50-100 ms in 1920*1080 resolution video
stream processing, with a multi-scale target recognition accuracy of over
98.5%, featuring both low latency and high precision. This study provides an
innovative solution for UAV monitoring and the application of domestic chips.

Abstract: In person re-identification, re-ranking is a crucial step to enhance the
overall accuracy by refining the initial ranking of retrieved results. Previous
studies have mainly focused on features from single-view images, which can
cause view bias and issues like pose variation, viewpoint changes, and
occlusions. Using multi-view features to present a person can help reduce view
bias. In this work, we present an efficient re-ranking method that generates
multi-view features by aggregating neighbors' features using K-nearest Weighted
Fusion (KWF) method. Specifically, we hypothesize that features extracted from
re-identification models are highly similar when representing the same
identity. Thus, we select K neighboring features in an unsupervised manner to
generate multi-view features. Additionally, this study explores the weight
selection strategies during feature aggregation, allowing us to identify an
effective strategy. Our re-ranking approach does not require model fine-tuning
or extra annotations, making it applicable to large-scale datasets. We evaluate
our method on the person re-identification datasets Market1501, MSMT17, and
Occluded-DukeMTMC. The results show that our method significantly improves
Rank@1 and mAP when re-ranking the top M candidates from the initial ranking

Abstract: Efficient perception models are essential for Advanced Driver Assistance
Systems (ADAS), as these applications require rapid processing and response to
ensure safety and effectiveness in real-world environments. To address the
real-time execution needs of such perception models, this study introduces the
TriLiteNet model. This model can simultaneously manage multiple tasks related
to panoramic driving perception. TriLiteNet is designed to optimize performance
while maintaining low computational costs. Experimental results on the BDD100k
dataset demonstrate that the model achieves competitive performance across
three key tasks: vehicle detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line
segmentation. Specifically, the TriLiteNet_{base} demonstrated a recall of
85.6% for vehicle detection, a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 92.4% for
drivable area segmentation, and an Acc of 82.3% for lane line segmentation with
only 2.35M parameters and a computational cost of 7.72 GFLOPs. Our proposed
model includes a tiny configuration with just 0.14M parameters, which provides
a multi-task solution with minimal computational demand. Evaluated for latency
and power consumption on embedded devices, TriLiteNet in both configurations
shows low latency and reasonable power during inference. By balancing
performance, computational efficiency, and scalability, TriLiteNet offers a
practical and deployable solution for real-world autonomous driving
applications. Code is available at https://github.com/chequanghuy/TriLiteNet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机具有低延迟、高动态范围和运动鲁棒性等优势，但缺乏专门用于行人安全研究的神经形态数据集，特别是在恶劣天气条件下的行人意图分析。

Method: 通过两种互补数据源构建数据集：(1) CARLA模拟器生成的合成事件流，控制不同天气和光照条件；(2) 真实世界JAAD行车记录仪视频使用v2e工具转换的事件流。提供配对RGB帧、事件帧和标签。

Result: 数据集包含原始AEDAT事件文件和AVI视频文件，基线SNN模型展示了数据集可用性，但揭示了模拟到现实的差距。

Conclusion: DVS-PedX旨在加速基于事件的行人安全、意图预测和神经形态感知研究，为领域适应和多模态融合提供基础。

Abstract: Event cameras like Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) report micro-timed brightness
changes instead of full frames, offering low latency, high dynamic range, and
motion robustness. DVS-PedX (Dynamic Vision Sensor Pedestrian eXploration) is a
neuromorphic dataset designed for pedestrian detection and crossing-intention
analysis in normal and adverse weather conditions across two complementary
sources: (1) synthetic event streams generated in the CARLA simulator for
controlled "approach-cross" scenes under varied weather and lighting; and (2)
real-world JAAD dash-cam videos converted to event streams using the v2e tool,
preserving natural behaviors and backgrounds. Each sequence includes paired RGB
frames, per-frame DVS "event frames" (33 ms accumulations), and frame-level
labels (crossing vs. not crossing). We also provide raw AEDAT 2.0/AEDAT 4.0
event files and AVI DVS video files and metadata for flexible re-processing.
Baseline spiking neural networks (SNNs) using SpikingJelly illustrate dataset
usability and reveal a sim-to-real gap, motivating domain adaptation and
multimodal fusion. DVS-PedX aims to accelerate research in event-based
pedestrian safety, intention prediction, and neuromorphic perception.

TL;DR: TaleDiffusion是一个用于生成多角色故事图像的新框架，通过迭代过程保持角色一致性并准确分配对话，解决了现有方法在角色一致性和对话渲染方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到故事可视化方法在多个角色跨帧交互时存在角色一致性差、产生伪影和对话渲染不准确的问题，导致故事叙述不连贯。

Method: 使用预训练LLM生成每帧描述、角色细节和对话，采用有界注意力掩码技术控制角色交互，应用身份一致自注意力机制确保跨帧角色一致性，以及区域感知交叉注意力进行精确对象放置，最后通过CLIPSeg渲染对话气泡并分配给角色。

Result: 实验结果表明，TaleDiffusion在一致性、降噪和对话渲染方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TaleDiffusion框架有效解决了多角色故事生成中的一致性和对话分配问题，为文本到故事可视化提供了更高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-story visualization is challenging due to the need for consistent
interaction among multiple characters across frames. Existing methods struggle
with character consistency, leading to artifact generation and inaccurate
dialogue rendering, which results in disjointed storytelling. In response, we
introduce TaleDiffusion, a novel framework for generating multi-character
stories with an iterative process, maintaining character consistency, and
accurate dialogue assignment via postprocessing. Given a story, we use a
pre-trained LLM to generate per-frame descriptions, character details, and
dialogues via in-context learning, followed by a bounded attention-based
per-box mask technique to control character interactions and minimize
artifacts. We then apply an identity-consistent self-attention mechanism to
ensure character consistency across frames and region-aware cross-attention for
precise object placement. Dialogues are also rendered as bubbles and assigned
to characters via CLIPSeg. Experimental results demonstrate that TaleDiffusion
outperforms existing methods in consistency, noise reduction, and dialogue
rendering.

Result: 在相同骨干网络下显著优于基线模型，图像质量和风格多样性都有显著提升

Conclusion: MEPG框架通过多专家协同工作有效解决了复杂提示生成问题，具有轻量级集成和强扩展性优势

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable image quality, but
they still struggle with complex, multiele ment prompts, and limited stylistic
diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Expert Planning and
Gen eration Framework (MEPG) that synergistically integrates position- and
style-aware large language models (LLMs) with spatial-semantic expert modules.
The framework comprises two core components: (1) a Position-Style-Aware (PSA)
module that utilizes a supervised fine-tuned LLM to decom pose input prompts
into precise spatial coordinates and style encoded semantic instructions; and
(2) a Multi-Expert Dif fusion (MED) module that implements cross-region genera
tion through dynamic expert routing across both local regions and global areas.
During the generation process for each lo cal region, specialized models (e.g.,
realism experts, styliza tion specialists) are selectively activated for each
spatial par tition via attention-based gating mechanisms. The architec ture
supports lightweight integration and replacement of ex pert models, providing
strong extensibility. Additionally, an interactive interface enables real-time
spatial layout editing and per-region style selection from a portfolio of
experts. Ex periments show that MEPG significantly outperforms base line models
with the same backbone in both image quality
  and style diversity.

Motivation: 现有深度伪造检测研究多在高度控制数据集上评估，需要在野生环境中进行更实际的测试

Method: 重新调整Ojha等人提出的基础视觉模型的超参数，使其适应野生深度伪造检测任务

Result: 在Deepfake-Eval-2024数据集上达到81%准确度，远超之前报告的61-69%准确度，与商业检测器82%的性能相当

Conclusion: 简单的基础模型通过谨慎的超参数调整可以在野生环境中实现高性能深度伪造检测，为实际部署提供了可行方案

Abstract: The widespread adoption of synthetic media demands accessible deepfake
detectors and realistic benchmarks. While most existing research evaluates
deepfake detectors on highly controlled datasets, we focus on the recently
released "in-the-wild" benchmark, Deepfake-Eval-2024. Initial reporting on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 showed that three finetuned open-source models achieve
accuracies between 61% and 69%, significantly lagging behind the leading
commercial deepfake detector with 82% accuracy. Our work revisits one of these
baseline approaches, originally introduced by Ojha et al., which adapts
standard pretrained vision backbones to produce generalizable deepfake
detectors. We demonstrate that with better-tuned hyperparameters, this simple
approach actually yields much higher performance -- 81% accuracy on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 -- surpassing the previously reported accuracy of this
baseline approach by 18% and competing with commercial deepfake detectors. We
discuss tradeoffs in accuracy, computational costs, and interpretability,
focusing on how practical these deepfake detectors might be when deployed in
real-world settings. Our code can be found at

Result: 方法达到mAP@.5 0.93和F1-score 0.90，超过单独YOLOv8模型的mAP@.5 0.91

Conclusion: 多个YOLO架构与融合多谱数据的结合提供了更可靠的解决方案，显著改善了可见光和热成像缺陷的检测能力

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with advanced sensors have opened up
new opportunities for monitoring wind power plants, including blades, towers,
and other critical components. However, reliable defect detection requires
high-resolution data and efficient methods to process multispectral imagery. In
this research, we aim to enhance defect detection accuracy through the
development of an ensemble of YOLO-based deep learning models that integrate
both visible and thermal channels. We propose an ensemble approach that
integrates a general-purpose YOLOv8 model with a specialized thermal model,
using a sophisticated bounding box fusion algorithm to combine their
predictions. Our experiments show this approach achieves a mean Average
Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.93 and an F1-score of 0.90, outperforming a standalone
YOLOv8 model, which scored an mAP@.5 of 0.91. These findings demonstrate that
combining multiple YOLO architectures with fused multispectral data provides a
more reliable solution, improving the detection of both visual and thermal
defects.

TL;DR: VisioFirm是一个开源的AI辅助图像标注工具，通过集成先进的基础模型和过滤管道，将人工标注工作量减少高达90%，支持多种标注格式和离线操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像标注工具需要大量人工输入，限制了大规模数据集的可扩展性。为了解决这个问题，需要开发一个AI辅助的自动化标注工具来减少人工工作量。

Method: 结合CLIP与预训练检测器（如Ultralytics模型）和零样本模型（如Grounding DINO），采用低置信度阈值化生成初始标注，通过交互式工具进行精炼，并利用WebGPU加速的Segment Anything进行实时分割。

Result: 在COCO类数据集上测试显示，初始预测大部分正确，人工工作量减少高达90%，同时通过聚类和IoU图保持高标注准确性。

Conclusion: VisioFirm通过AI辅助自动化显著提高了图像标注效率，支持多种标注类型和导出格式，具有离线操作能力，为大规模数据集标注提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: AI models rely on annotated data to learn pattern and perform prediction.
Annotation is usually a labor-intensive step that require associating labels
ranging from a simple classification label to more complex tasks such as object
detection, oriented bounding box estimation, and instance segmentation.
Traditional tools often require extensive manual input, limiting scalability
for large datasets. To address this, we introduce VisioFirm, an open-source web
application designed to streamline image labeling through AI-assisted
automation. VisioFirm integrates state-of-the-art foundation models into an
interface with a filtering pipeline to reduce human-in-the-loop efforts. This
hybrid approach employs CLIP combined with pre-trained detectors like
Ultralytics models for common classes and zero-shot models such as Grounding
DINO for custom labels, generating initial annotations with low-confidence
thresholding to maximize recall. Through this framework, when tested on
COCO-type of classes, initial prediction have been proven to be mostly correct
though the users can refine these via interactive tools supporting bounding
boxes, oriented bounding boxes, and polygons. Additionally, VisioFirm has
on-the-fly segmentation powered by Segment Anything accelerated through WebGPU
for browser-side efficiency. The tool supports multiple export formats (YOLO,
COCO, Pascal VOC, CSV) and operates offline after model caching, enhancing
accessibility. VisioFirm demonstrates up to 90\% reduction in manual effort
through benchmarks on diverse datasets, while maintaining high annotation
accuracy via clustering of connected CLIP-based disambiguate components and
IoU-graph for redundant detection suppression. VisioFirm can be accessed from

Motivation: 现有UCIR方法在整个图像层面进行跨域特征对齐，由于对象特征与域特定风格纠缠，难以有效处理域间差异

Method: 利用文本到图像生成模型进行特征解缠，分离对象特征和域特定风格；采用渐进式跨域互邻对齐策略实现可靠的特征对齐

Result: 在三个基准数据集涵盖13个域的实验中，DUDE达到了最先进的性能表现

Conclusion: 通过特征解缠和渐进式跨域对齐，DUDE有效解决了无监督跨域图像检索中的域间差异挑战，显著提升了检索性能

Abstract: Unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval (UCIR) aims to retrieve images of
the same category across diverse domains without relying on annotations.
Existing UCIR methods, which align cross-domain features for the entire image,
often struggle with the domain gap, as the object features critical for
retrieval are frequently entangled with domain-specific styles. To address this
challenge, we propose DUDE, a novel UCIR method building upon feature
disentanglement. In brief, DUDE leverages a text-to-image generative model to
disentangle object features from domain-specific styles, thus facilitating
semantical image retrieval. To further achieve reliable alignment of the
disentangled object features, DUDE aligns mutual neighbors from within domains
to across domains in a progressive manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DUDE achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets
over 13 domains. The code will be released.

Conclusion: LASER框架有效提升了视觉语言模型在多步感知和精确坐标预测方面的能力，为GUI grounding任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have recently achieved significant progress in
bridging visual perception and linguistic reasoning. Recently, OpenAI o3 model
introduced a zoom-in search strategy that effectively elicits active perception
capabilities in VLMs, improving downstream task performance. However, enabling
VLMs to reason effectively over appropriate image regions remains a core
challenge in GUI grounding, particularly under high-resolution inputs and
complex multi-element visual interactions. In this work, we propose LASER, a
self-evolving framework that progressively endows VLMs with multi-step
perception capabilities, enabling precise coordinate prediction. Specifically,
our approach integrate Monte Carlo quality estimation with
Intersection-over-Union (IoU)-based region quality evaluation to jointly
encourage both accuracy and diversity in constructing high-quality preference
data. This combination explicitly guides the model to focus on
instruction-relevant key regions while adaptively allocating reasoning steps
based on task complexity. Comprehensive experiments on the ScreenSpot Pro and
ScreenSpot-v2 benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains, validating
the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, when fine-tuned on GTA1-7B, LASER
achieves a score of 55.7 on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, establishing a new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) among 7B-scale models.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of overhead remote sensing imagery enables applications
in mapping, urban planning, and disaster response. State-of-the-art
segmentation networks are typically developed and tuned on ground-perspective
photographs and do not directly address remote sensing challenges such as
extreme scale variation, foreground-background imbalance, and large image
sizes. We explore the incorporation of the differential morphological profile
(DMP), a multi-scale shape extraction method based on grayscale morphology,
into modern segmentation networks. Prior studies have shown that the DMP can
provide critical shape information to Deep Neural Networks to enable superior
detection and classification performance in overhead imagery. In this work, we
extend prior DMPNet work beyond classification and object detection by
integrating DMP features into three state-of-the-art convolutional and
transformer semantic segmentation architectures. We utilize both direct input,
which adapts the input stem of feature extraction architectures to accept DMP
channels, and hybrid architectures, a dual-stream design that fuses RGB and DMP
encoders. Using the iSAID benchmark dataset, we evaluate a variety of DMP
differentials and structuring element shapes to more effectively provide shape
information to the model. Our results show that while non-DMP models generally
outperform the direct-input variants, hybrid DMP consistently outperforms
direct-input and is capable of surpassing a non-DMP model on mIoU, F1, and
Recall.

Abstract: Accurate quantification of tau pathology via tau positron emission tomography
(PET) scan is crucial for diagnosing and monitoring Alzheimer's disease (AD).
However, the high cost and limited availability of tau PET restrict its
widespread use. In contrast, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
plasma-based biomarkers provide non-invasive and widely available complementary
information related to brain anatomy and disease progression. In this work, we
propose a text-guided 3D diffusion model for 3D tau PET image synthesis,
leveraging multimodal conditions from both structural MRI and plasma
measurement. Specifically, the textual prompt is from the plasma p-tau217
measurement, which is a key indicator of AD progression, while MRI provides
anatomical structure constraints. The proposed framework is trained and
evaluated using clinical AV1451 tau PET data from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach can generate realistic, clinically meaningful 3D tau PET across a
range of disease stages. The proposed framework can help perform tau PET data
augmentation under different settings, provide a non-invasive, cost-effective
alternative for visualizing tau pathology, and support the simulation of
disease progression under varying plasma biomarker levels and cognitive
conditions.

Abstract: Despite signi cant progress in semi-supervised medical image segmentation,
most existing segmentation networks overlook e ective methodological guidance
for feature extraction and important prior information from
  datasets. In this paper, we develop a semi-supervised medical image
segmentation framework that e ectively integrates spatial regularization
methods and volume priors. Speci cally, our approach integrates a strong
explicit volume prior at the image scale and Threshold Dynamics spatial
regularization, both derived from variational models, into the backbone
segmentation network. The target region volumes for each unlabeled image are
estimated by a regression network, which e ectively regularizes the backbone
segmentation network through an image-scale Wasserstein distance constraint,
ensuring that the class ratios in the segmentation results for each unlabeled
image match those predicted by the regression network. Additionally, we design
a dataset-scale Wasserstein distance loss function based on a weak implicit
volume prior, which enforces that the volume distribution predicted for the
unlabeled dataset is similar to that of labeled dataset. Experimental results
on the 2017 ACDC dataset, PROMISE12 dataset, and thigh muscle MR image dataset
show the superiority of the proposed method.

Abstract: We present a novel self-supervised framework for learning articulated object
representations from sparse-view, unposed images. Unlike prior methods that
require dense multi-view observations and ground-truth camera poses, our
approach operates with as few as four views per articulation and no camera
supervision. To address the inherent challenges, we first reconstruct each
articulation independently using recent advances in sparse-view 3D
reconstruction, then learn a deformation field that establishes dense
correspondences across poses. A progressive disentanglement strategy further
separates static from moving parts, enabling robust separation of camera and
object motion. Finally, we jointly optimize geometry, appearance, and
kinematics with a self-supervised loss that enforces cross-view and cross-pose
consistency. Experiments on the standard benchmark and real-world examples
demonstrate that our method produces accurate and detailed articulated object
representations under significantly weaker input assumptions than existing
approaches.

Abstract: Semantic noise in image classification datasets, where visually similar
categories are frequently mislabeled, poses a significant challenge to
conventional supervised learning approaches. In this paper, we explore the
potential of using synthetic images generated by advanced text-to-image models
to address this issue. Although these high-quality synthetic images come with
reliable labels, their direct application in training is limited by domain gaps
and diversity constraints. Unlike conventional approaches, we propose a novel
method that leverages synthetic images as reliable reference points to identify
and correct mislabeled samples in noisy datasets. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmark datasets show that our approach significantly improves
classification accuracy under various noise conditions, especially in
challenging scenarios with semantic label noise. Additionally, since our method

TL;DR: 提出基于DINO的高效异常检测模型，参数减少1/3，训练时间缩短3倍，性能保持竞争力，并建立了多模态大语言模型基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多目标场景中异常检测任务对深度学习模型的空间推理、关系推理和跨类别泛化能力的高要求，同时关注计算效率问题。

Method: 采用DINO-based模型架构，通过优化设计减少模型参数和训练时间，并与多模态大语言模型进行对比实验。

Result: 模型参数量减少33%，训练时间缩短至原来的1/3，在保持竞争性能的同时显著提升效率。多模态大语言模型在结构化视觉推理任务中存在明显局限性。

Conclusion: 提出的高效模型成功解决了odd-one-out异常检测任务的效率问题，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案，同时揭示了多模态大语言模型在该类任务中的不足。

Abstract: The recently introduced odd-one-out anomaly detection task involves
identifying the odd-looking instances within a multi-object scene. This problem
presents several challenges for modern deep learning models, demanding spatial
reasoning across multiple views and relational reasoning to understand context
and generalize across varying object categories and layouts. We argue that
these challenges must be addressed with efficiency in mind. To this end, we
propose a DINO-based model that reduces the number of parameters by one third
and shortens training time by a factor of three compared to the current
state-of-the-art, while maintaining competitive performance. Our experimental
evaluation also introduces a Multimodal Large Language Model baseline,
providing insights into its current limitations in structured visual reasoning
tasks. The project page can be found at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoArena是一个评估大视觉语言模型图像地理定位能力的开放平台，解决了现有评估方法的数据泄露和隐私问题，通过真实野外图像和人类判断进行更准确的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像地理定位评估存在两个主要问题：1）数据泄露 - 大模型在测试数据上预训练导致评估失真；2）现有指标依赖精确坐标，忽视推理过程且存在隐私风险。

Method: 开发GeoArena平台，允许用户上传真实野外图像构建多样化评估语料库，利用成对人类判断来评估模型输出与人类期望的匹配程度。

Result: 平台上线两个月收集了数千条投票记录，基于这些数据进行了详细分析，并建立了不同大模型在图像地理定位任务上的排行榜。

Conclusion: GeoArena提供了一个真实野外和以人为中心的基准测试平台，解决了现有评估方法的局限性，为图像地理定位任务提供了更可靠的评估框架。

Abstract: Image geolocalization aims to predict the geographic location of images
captured anywhere on Earth, but its global nature presents significant
challenges. Current evaluation methodologies suffer from two major limitations.
First, data leakage: advanced approaches often rely on large vision-language
models (LVLMs) to predict image locations, yet these models are frequently
pretrained on the test datasets, compromising the accuracy of evaluating a
model's actual geolocalization capability. Second, existing metrics primarily
rely on exact geographic coordinates to assess predictions, which not only
neglects the reasoning process but also raises privacy concerns when user-level
location data is required. To address these issues, we propose GeoArena, a
first open platform for evaluating LVLMs on worldwide image geolocalization
tasks, offering true in-the-wild and human-centered benchmarking. GeoArena
enables users to upload in-the-wild images for a more diverse evaluation
corpus, and it leverages pairwise human judgments to determine which model
output better aligns with human expectations. Our platform has been deployed
online for two months, during which we collected over thousands voting records.
Based on this data, we conduct a detailed analysis and establish a leaderboard
of different LVLMs on the image geolocalization task.

TL;DR: FE2E是一个基于图像编辑模型而非文本生成模型的密集几何预测框架，通过扩散变换器架构实现了深度和法线的联合估计，在多个数据集上取得了显著的零样本性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密集预测本质上是图像到图像的任务，图像编辑模型比文本到图像生成模型更适合作为微调基础，因为编辑模型具有固有的结构先验

Method: 提出FE2E框架，将先进的基于DiT架构的编辑模型适配到密集几何预测任务，重新制定流匹配损失为"一致速度"训练目标，使用对数量化解决精度冲突，利用DiT的全局注意力实现深度和法线的联合估计

Result: 在不扩大训练数据的情况下，在多个数据集的零样本单目深度和法线估计中取得了显著性能提升，在ETH3D数据集上获得超过35%的性能增益，性能优于使用100倍数据训练的DepthAnything系列

Conclusion: 图像编辑模型比生成模型更适合密集几何预测任务，FE2E框架通过有效利用编辑模型的结构先验和DiT架构的优势，实现了卓越的性能表现

Abstract: Leveraging visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) generative
models has shown success in dense prediction. However, dense prediction is
inherently an image-to-image task, suggesting that image editing models, rather
than T2I generative models, may be a more suitable foundation for fine-tuning.
  Motivated by this, we conduct a systematic analysis of the fine-tuning
behaviors of both editors and generators for dense geometry estimation. Our
findings show that editing models possess inherent structural priors, which
enable them to converge more stably by ``refining" their innate features, and
ultimately achieve higher performance than their generative counterparts.
  Based on these findings, we introduce \textbf{FE2E}, a framework that
pioneeringly adapts an advanced editing model based on Diffusion Transformer
(DiT) architecture for dense geometry prediction. Specifically, to tailor the
editor for this deterministic task, we reformulate the editor's original flow
matching loss into the ``consistent velocity" training objective. And we use
logarithmic quantization to resolve the precision conflict between the editor's
native BFloat16 format and the high precision demand of our tasks.
Additionally, we leverage the DiT's global attention for a cost-free joint
estimation of depth and normals in a single forward pass, enabling their
supervisory signals to mutually enhance each other.
  Without scaling up the training data, FE2E achieves impressive performance
improvements in zero-shot monocular depth and normal estimation across multiple
datasets. Notably, it achieves over 35\% performance gains on the ETH3D dataset
and outperforms the DepthAnything series, which is trained on 100$\times$ data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态面部表情识别面临长尾类别分布和复杂时空特征建模的挑战，现有深度学习方法存在模型归纳偏差问题，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 提出MICACL多实例学习框架，包含图增强实例交互模块(GEIIM)捕获时空依赖关系，加权实例聚合网络(WIAN)动态分配实例权重，以及多尺度类别感知对比学习(MCCL)策略平衡类别训练。

Result: 在DFEW和FERV39k等野外数据集上的大量实验表明，MICACL实现了最先进的性能，具有优异的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: MICACL框架有效解决了动态表情识别中的长尾分布和时空建模问题，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) faces significant challenges due
to long-tailed category distributions and complexity of spatio-temporal feature
modeling. While existing deep learning-based methods have improved DFER
performance, they often fail to address these issues, resulting in severe model
induction bias. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
multi-instance learning framework called MICACL, which integrates
spatio-temporal dependency modeling and long-tailed contrastive learning
optimization. Specifically, we design the Graph-Enhanced Instance Interaction
Module (GEIIM) to capture intricate spatio-temporal between adjacent instances
relationships through adaptive adjacency matrices and multiscale convolutions.
To enhance instance-level feature aggregation, we develop the Weighted Instance
Aggregation Network (WIAN), which dynamically assigns weights based on instance
importance. Furthermore, we introduce a Multiscale Category-aware Contrastive
Learning (MCCL) strategy to balance training between major and minor
categories. Extensive experiments on in-the-wild datasets (i.e., DFEW and
FERV39k) demonstrate that MICACL achieves state-of-the-art performance with
superior robustness and generalization.

Abstract: First responders widely adopt body-worn cameras to document incident scenes
and support post-event analysis. However, reviewing lengthy video footage is
impractical in time-critical situations. Effective situational awareness
demands a concise visual summary that can be quickly interpreted. This work
presents a computer vision pipeline that transforms body-camera footage into
informative panoramic images summarizing the incident scene. Our method
leverages monocular Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to estimate
camera trajectories and reconstruct the spatial layout of the environment. Key
viewpoints are identified by clustering camera poses along the trajectory, and
representative frames from each cluster are selected. These frames are fused
into spatially coherent panoramic images using multi-frame stitching
techniques. The resulting summaries enable rapid understanding of complex
environments and facilitate efficient decision-making and incident review.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本基于人员异常检索中的两大挑战：文本异常上下文与视觉行为的细粒度对齐，以及实际应用中异常样本稀缩的问题。虽然大型多模态模型在多模态理解方面表现优异，但其在细粒度异常检索中的潜力尚未得到充分挖掘。

Conclusion: AnomalyLMM成功地将大型多模态模型应用于文本基于人员异常检索任务，通过无需训练的适配技术有效解决了域间差异和样本稀缩问题，为该领域的未来研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: With growing public safety demands, text-based person anomaly search has
emerged as a critical task, aiming to retrieve individuals with abnormal
behaviors via natural language descriptions. Unlike conventional person search,
this task presents two unique challenges: (1) fine-grained cross-modal
alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, and (2) anomaly
recognition under sparse real-world samples. While Large Multi-modal Models
(LMMs) excel in multi-modal understanding, their potential for fine-grained
anomaly retrieval remains underexplored, hindered by: (1) a domain gap between
generative knowledge and discriminative retrieval, and (2) the absence of
efficient adaptation strategies for deployment. In this work, we propose
AnomalyLMM, the first framework that harnesses LMMs for text-based person
anomaly search. Our key contributions are: (1) A novel coarse-to-fine pipeline
integrating LMMs to bridge generative world knowledge with retrieval-centric
anomaly detection; (2) A training-free adaptation cookbook featuring masked
cross-modal prompting, behavioral saliency prediction, and knowledge-aware
re-ranking, enabling zero-shot focus on subtle anomaly cues. As the first study
to explore LMMs for this task, we conduct a rigorous evaluation on the PAB
dataset, the only publicly available benchmark for text-based person anomaly
search, with its curated real-world anomalies covering diverse scenarios (e.g.,
falling, collision, and being hit). Experiments show the effectiveness of the
proposed method, surpassing the competitive baseline by +0.96% Recall@1
accuracy. Notably, our method reveals interpretable alignment between textual
anomalies and visual behaviors, validated via qualitative analysis. Our code
and models will be released for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有美学图像描述研究主要依赖微调方法，没有专门让多模态大语言模型关注目标美学内容，需要一种能够显式融入美学显著性的方法。

Method: 提出端到端的ASE-MLLM框架，包含图像美学显著性模块(IASM)高效提取美学显著性特征，设计IAS-ViT图像编码器通过交叉注意力机制将美学特征与原始图像特征融合。

Result: 在主流美学图像描述基准测试中显著优于传统方法和通用多模态大语言模型，达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: ASE-MLLM是首个专门为美学图像描述任务整合图像美学显著性的多模态大语言模型框架，有效解决了现有方法在美学内容关注方面的局限性。

Abstract: Aesthetic Image Captioning (AIC) aims to generate textual descriptions of
image aesthetics, becoming a key research direction in the field of
computational aesthetics. In recent years, pretrained Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly, leading to a significant increase in
image aesthetics research that integrates both visual and textual modalities.
However, most existing studies on image aesthetics primarily focus on
predicting aesthetic ratings and have shown limited application in AIC.
Existing AIC works leveraging MLLMs predominantly rely on fine-tuning methods
without specifically adapting MLLMs to focus on target aesthetic content. To
address this limitation, we propose the Aesthetic Saliency Enhanced Multimodal
Large Language Model (ASE-MLLM), an end-to-end framework that explicitly
incorporates aesthetic saliency into MLLMs. Within this framework, we introduce
the Image Aesthetic Saliency Module (IASM), which efficiently and effectively
extracts aesthetic saliency features from images. Additionally, we design
IAS-ViT as the image encoder for MLLMs, this module fuses aesthetic saliency
features with original image features via a cross-attention mechanism. To the
best of our knowledge, ASE-MLLM is the first framework to integrate image
aesthetic saliency into MLLMs specifically for AIC tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrated that our approach significantly outperformed traditional methods
and generic MLLMs on current mainstream AIC benchmarks, achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的3D风格迁移管道，利用预训练2D扩散模型的先验知识，通过交叉视图风格对齐和实例级风格迁移，解决了现有方法在提取高级风格语义和保持结构清晰度方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经表示方法（如NeRF和3D高斯泼溅）在3D场景风格迁移中难以有效提取和传递参考风格图像的高级语义，且风格化结果缺乏结构清晰度和实例分离性。

Method: 采用两阶段管道：1）利用扩散先验生成关键视角的风格化渲染；2）将风格化关键视图转移到3D表示。创新设计包括交叉视图风格对齐（在UNet最后上采样块插入交叉视图注意力）和实例级风格迁移。

Result: 在广泛场景（从正向面对到挑战性360度环境）的定性和定量实验中，该方法显著优于最先进方法，实现了更具结构性、视觉连贯性和艺术丰富性的风格化效果。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了3D风格迁移中的关键挑战，通过整合扩散模型先验和创新的跨视图一致性机制，实现了高质量的3D场景风格化效果。

Abstract: Recent advancements in neural representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields
and 3D Gaussian Splatting, have increased interest in applying style transfer
to 3D scenes. While existing methods can transfer style patterns onto
3D-consistent neural representations, they struggle to effectively extract and
transfer high-level style semantics from the reference style image.
Additionally, the stylized results often lack structural clarity and
separation, making it difficult to distinguish between different instances or
objects within the 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
3D style transfer pipeline that effectively integrates prior knowledge from
pretrained 2D diffusion models. Our pipeline consists of two key stages: First,
we leverage diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints.
Then, we transfer the stylized key views onto the 3D representation. This
process incorporates two innovative designs. The first is cross-view style
alignment, which inserts cross-view attention into the last upsampling block of
the UNet, allowing feature interactions across multiple key views. This ensures
that the diffusion model generates stylized key views that maintain both style
fidelity and instance-level consistency. The second is instance-level style
transfer, which effectively leverages instance-level consistency across
stylized key views and transfers it onto the 3D representation. This results in
a more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylization.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our 3D
style transfer pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across a wide range of scenes, from forward-facing to challenging 360-degree
environments. Visit our project page https://jm-xu.github.io/SSGaussian for

Motivation: X射线叠层衍射成像在纳米尺度分辨率方面表现优异，但当照明探针未知时，传统迭代方法和深度学习方法在低剂量高速实验的低信号条件下重建效果不佳，限制了该技术的广泛应用。

Method: 提出PtyINR框架，将物体和探针参数化为连续的神经表示，直接从原始衍射图案进行端到端重建，无需任何探针预表征。

Conclusion: PtyINR提供了一个通用的、物理信息驱动的框架，适用于解决探针依赖的逆问题，可广泛应用于计算显微镜领域的各种问题。

Abstract: X-ray ptychography provides exceptional nanoscale resolution and is widely
applied in materials science, biology, and nanotechnology. However, its full
potential is constrained by the critical challenge of accurately reconstructing
images when the illuminating probe is unknown. Conventional iterative methods
and deep learning approaches are often suboptimal, particularly under the
low-signal conditions inherent to low-dose and high-speed experiments. These
limitations compromise reconstruction fidelity and restrict the broader
adoption of the technique. In this work, we introduce the Ptychographic
Implicit Neural Representation (PtyINR), a self-supervised framework that
simultaneously addresses the object and probe recovery problem. By
parameterizing both as continuous neural representations, PtyINR performs
end-to-end reconstruction directly from raw diffraction patterns without
requiring any pre-characterization of the probe. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that PtyINR achieves superior reconstruction quality on both
simulated and experimental data, with remarkable robustness under challenging
low-signal conditions. Furthermore, PtyINR offers a generalizable,
physics-informed framework for addressing probe-dependent inverse problems,
making it applicable to a wide range of computational microscopy problems.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly evolving, presenting
increasingly complex safety challenges. However, current dataset construction
methods, which are risk-oriented, fail to cover the growing complexity of
real-world multimodal safety scenarios (RMS). And due to the lack of a unified
evaluation metric, their overall effectiveness remains unproven. This paper
introduces a novel image-oriented self-adaptive dataset construction method for
RMS, which starts with images and end constructing paired text and guidance
responses. Using the image-oriented method, we automatically generate an RMS
dataset comprising 35k image-text pairs with guidance responses. Additionally,
we introduce a standardized safety dataset evaluation metric: fine-tuning a
safety judge model and evaluating its capabilities on other safety
datasets.Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed image-oriented pipeline. The results confirm the scalability
and effectiveness of the image-oriented approach, offering a new perspective
for the construction of real-world multimodal safety datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的流式3D生成模型需要数十步采样，推理速度慢。虽然一致性模型在2D扩散模型加速方面取得进展，但在更复杂的3D生成任务中仍未被充分探索。

Method: 提出MDT-dist框架，通过Velocity Matching学习稳定匹配师生模型的流速场，再通过Velocity Distillation利用学习到的流速场进行概率密度蒸馏，实现从传输级别到流速和分布级别的等效优化转换。

Result: 在TRELLIS框架上，将每个流变换器的采样步数从25减少到1-2步，在A800上实现0.68s（1步×2）和0.94s（2步×2）的延迟，分别获得9.0倍和6.5倍加速，同时保持高视觉和几何保真度。

Conclusion: 该方法显著优于现有的CM蒸馏方法，使TRELLIS在少步3D生成中实现卓越性能，为3D生成模型的实时应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Flow-based 3D generation models typically require dozens of sampling steps
during inference. Though few-step distillation methods, particularly
Consistency Models (CMs), have achieved substantial advancements in
accelerating 2D diffusion models, they remain under-explored for more complex
3D generation tasks. In this study, we propose a novel framework, MDT-dist, for
few-step 3D flow distillation. Our approach is built upon a primary objective:
distilling the pretrained model to learn the Marginal-Data Transport. Directly
learning this objective needs to integrate the velocity fields, while this
integral is intractable to be implemented. Therefore, we propose two
optimizable objectives, Velocity Matching (VM) and Velocity Distillation (VD),
to equivalently convert the optimization target from the transport level to the
velocity and the distribution level respectively. Velocity Matching (VM) learns
to stably match the velocity fields between the student and the teacher, but
inevitably provides biased gradient estimates. Velocity Distillation (VD)
further enhances the optimization process by leveraging the learned velocity
fields to perform probability density distillation. When evaluated on the
pioneer 3D generation framework TRELLIS, our method reduces sampling steps of
each flow transformer from 25 to 1 or 2, achieving 0.68s (1 step x 2) and 0.94s
(2 steps x 2) latency with 9.0x and 6.5x speedup on A800, while preserving high
visual and geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing CM distillation methods, and enables
TRELLIS to achieve superior performance in few-step 3D generation.

Conclusion: Durian通过创新的双参考网络设计和训练策略，成功实现了零样本肖像动画视频的高质量属性迁移，为多属性组合生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present Durian, the first method for generating portrait animation videos
with facial attribute transfer from a given reference image to a target
portrait in a zero-shot manner. To enable high-fidelity and spatially
consistent attribute transfer across frames, we introduce dual reference
networks that inject spatial features from both the portrait and attribute
images into the denoising process of a diffusion model. We train the model
using a self-reconstruction formulation, where two frames are sampled from the
same portrait video: one is treated as the attribute reference and the other as
the target portrait, and the remaining frames are reconstructed conditioned on
these inputs and their corresponding masks. To support the transfer of
attributes with varying spatial extent, we propose a mask expansion strategy
using keypoint-conditioned image generation for training. In addition, we
further augment the attribute and portrait images with spatial and
appearance-level transformations to improve robustness to positional
misalignment between them. These strategies allow the model to effectively
generalize across diverse attributes and in-the-wild reference combinations,
despite being trained without explicit triplet supervision. Durian achieves
state-of-the-art performance on portrait animation with attribute transfer, and
notably, its dual reference design enables multi-attribute composition in a
single generation pass without additional training.

Abstract: Collimation in X-ray imaging restricts exposure to the region-of-interest
(ROI) and minimizes the radiation dose applied to the patient. The detection of
collimator shadows is an essential image-based preprocessing step in digital
radiography posing a challenge when edges get obscured by scattered X-ray
radiation. Regardless, the prior knowledge that collimation forms
polygonal-shaped shadows is evident. For this reason, we introduce a deep
learning-based segmentation that is inherently constrained to its geometry. We
achieve this by incorporating a differentiable Hough transform-based network to
detect the collimation borders and enhance its capability to extract the
information about the ROI center. During inference, we combine the information
of both tasks to enable the generation of refined, line-constrained
segmentation masks. We demonstrate robust reconstruction of collimated regions
achieving median Hausdorff distances of 4.3-5.0mm on diverse test sets of real
Xray images. While this application involves at most four shadow borders, our
method is not fundamentally limited by a specific number of edges.

### [67] [The Telephone Game: Evaluating Semantic Drift in Unified Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04438)
*Sabbir Mollah,Rohit Gupta,Sirnam Swetha,Qingyang Liu,Ahnaf Munir,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了UCF-UM框架，通过循环评估协议量化统一视觉语言模型在图像到文本和文本到图像转换中的语义漂移问题，并引入三个新指标来评估跨模态一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法单独考察文本到图像生成和图像到文本理解能力，无法揭示模型在跨模态循环转换中是否能保持语义一致性，需要新的评估框架来量化语义漂移。

Method: 设计循环评估协议，交替进行I2T和T2I多代转换来量化语义漂移，提出三个指标：MCD（平均累积漂移）、SDR（语义漂移率）和MGG（多代GenEval）。创建ND400新基准数据集。

Result: 评估了七个最新模型，发现跨模态稳定性存在显著差异：BAGEL模型能在多次交替中保持语义，而Vila-u模型尽管单次评分高但语义漂移快。

Conclusion: 循环一致性评估是标准I2T和T2I评估的必要补充，UCF-UM提供了实用的指标来一致评估统一模型的跨模态稳定性和共享表示强度。

Abstract: Employing a single, unified model (UM) for both visual understanding
(image-to-text: I2T) and and visual generation (text-to-image: T2I) has opened
a new direction in Visual Language Model (VLM) research. While UMs can also
support broader unimodal tasks (e.g., text-to-text, image-to-image), we focus
on the core cross-modal pair T2I and I2T, as consistency between understanding
and generation is critical for downstream use. Existing evaluations consider
these capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such
as MME, MMBench for I2T. These single-pass metrics do not reveal whether a
model that understands a concept can also render it, nor whether meaning is
preserved when cycling between image and text modalities. To address this, we
introduce the Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM), a
cyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple
generations to quantify semantic drift. UCF formulates 3 metrics: (i) Mean
Cumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic loss;
(ii) Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), that summarizes semantic decay rate; and (iii)
Multi-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending
GenEval. To assess generalization beyond COCO, which is widely used in
training; we create a new benchmark ND400, sampled from NoCaps and DOCCI and
evaluate on seven recent models. UCF-UM reveals substantial variation in
cross-modal stability: some models like BAGEL maintain semantics over many
alternations, whereas others like Vila-u drift quickly despite strong
single-pass scores. Our results highlight cyclic consistency as a necessary
complement to standard I2T and T2I evaluations, and provide practical metrics
to consistently assess unified model's cross-modal stability and strength of
their shared representations. Code:

Abstract: Driven by the demand for spatial intelligence and holistic scene perception,
omnidirectional images (ODIs), which provide a complete 360\textdegree{} field
of view, are receiving growing attention across diverse applications such as
virtual reality, autonomous driving, and embodied robotics. Despite their
unique characteristics, ODIs exhibit remarkable differences from perspective
images in geometric projection, spatial distribution, and boundary continuity,
making it challenging for direct domain adaption from perspective methods. This
survey reviews recent panoramic vision techniques with a particular emphasis on
the perspective-to-panorama adaptation. We first revisit the panoramic imaging
pipeline and projection methods to build the prior knowledge required for
analyzing the structural disparities. Then, we summarize three challenges of
domain adaptation: severe geometric distortions near the poles, non-uniform
sampling in Equirectangular Projection (ERP), and periodic boundary continuity.
Building on this, we cover 20+ representative tasks drawn from more than 300
research papers in two dimensions. On one hand, we present a cross-method
analysis of representative strategies for addressing panoramic specific
challenges across different tasks. On the other hand, we conduct a cross-task
comparison and classify panoramic vision into four major categories: visual
quality enhancement and assessment, visual understanding, multimodal
understanding, and visual generation. In addition, we discuss open challenges
and future directions in data, models, and applications that will drive the
advancement of panoramic vision research. We hope that our work can provide new
insight and forward looking perspectives to advance the development of
panoramic vision technologies. Our project page is

Motivation: 随着文本到图像扩散模型在创意领域的广泛应用，需要提供增强的控制、精炼能力以及生成后一致修改图像的功能，现有方法在保持多帧视觉和叙事一致性方面缺乏灵活性

Method: Plot'n Polish零样本框架，能够在不同细节级别上对故事可视化提供细粒度控制

Result: 该框架能够实现一致的故事生成，并提供各种细节级别的精细控制

Conclusion: Plot'n Polish解决了现有方法在故事可视化中缺乏灵活性和一致性的挑战，为创作者提供了无缝制作和精炼视觉故事的能力

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated significant capabilities to
generate diverse and detailed visuals in various domains, and story
visualization is emerging as a particularly promising application. However, as
their use in real-world creative domains increases, the need for providing
enhanced control, refinement, and the ability to modify images post-generation
in a consistent manner becomes an important challenge. Existing methods often
lack the flexibility to apply fine or coarse edits while maintaining visual and
narrative consistency across multiple frames, preventing creators from
seamlessly crafting and refining their visual stories. To address these
challenges, we introduce Plot'n Polish, a zero-shot framework that enables
consistent story generation and provides fine-grained control over story
visualizations at various levels of detail.

Motivation: 解决长时间虚拟试穿视频生成的挑战，包括需要大量计算资源和长视频数据，以及保证视频的局部光滑性和全局时间一致性。

Method: 采用分段自回归生成方式，通过前缀视频条件保证局部光滑性，利用锚点视频（360度全身视频）维护全局一致性。

Result: VFR能够生成分钟级别的虚拟试穿视频，在各种动作下都能保持局部光滑性和全局时间一致性。

Conclusion: 该研究是长时间虚拟试穿视频生成领域的首创性工作，为解决相关问题提供了有效的方案。

Abstract: We introduce the Virtual Fitting Room (VFR), a novel video generative model
that produces arbitrarily long virtual try-on videos. Our VFR models long video
generation tasks as an auto-regressive, segment-by-segment generation process,
eliminating the need for resource-intensive generation and lengthy video data,
while providing the flexibility to generate videos of arbitrary length. The key
challenges of this task are twofold: ensuring local smoothness between adjacent
segments and maintaining global temporal consistency across different segments.
To address these challenges, we propose our VFR framework, which ensures
smoothness through a prefix video condition and enforces consistency with the
anchor video -- a 360-degree video that comprehensively captures the human's
wholebody appearance. Our VFR generates minute-scale virtual try-on videos with
both local smoothness and global temporal consistency under various motions,
making it a pioneering work in long virtual try-on video generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 美国过半数阿尔茫海默病患者未被诊断，语音基于筛查提供了可扩展的检测方案。需要研究大语言模型在症状疾病检测中的最佳适配策略。

Method: 使用DementiaBank语音语料库，评估了9个文本模型和3个多模态音频-文本模型。测试了上下文学习、推理增强提示、参数高效精细调整和多模态整合等适配策略。

Result: 类质心示例在上下文学习中表现最佳，推理提示提升了小模型性能，分词级精细调整通常获得最高分。添加分类头显著改善了表现较差的模型。多模态模型表现良好但未超过最佳文本模型。

Conclusion: 模型适配策略（包括示例选择、推理设计和调整方法）对语音基于症状疾病检测致关重要，适当适配的开源模型可以达到或超越商业系统的效果。

Abstract: Over half of US adults with Alzheimer disease and related dementias remain
undiagnosed, and speech-based screening offers a scalable detection approach.
We compared large language model adaptation strategies for dementia detection
using the DementiaBank speech corpus, evaluating nine text-only models and
three multimodal audio-text models on recordings from DementiaBank speech
corpus. Adaptations included in-context learning with different demonstration
selection policies, reasoning-augmented prompting, parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, and multimodal integration. Results showed that class-centroid
demonstrations achieved the highest in-context learning performance, reasoning
improved smaller models, and token-level fine-tuning generally produced the
best scores. Adding a classification head substantially improved
underperforming models. Among multimodal models, fine-tuned audio-text systems
performed well but did not surpass the top text-only models. These findings
highlight that model adaptation strategies, including demonstration selection,
reasoning design, and tuning method, critically influence speech-based dementia
detection, and that properly adapted open-weight models can match or exceed
commercial systems.

Abstract: Understanding how scientific ideas evolve requires more than summarizing
individual papers-it demands structured, cross-document reasoning over
thematically related research. In this work, we formalize multi-document
scientific inference, a new task that extracts and aligns motivation,
methodology, and experimental results across related papers to reconstruct
research development chains. This task introduces key challenges, including
temporally aligning loosely structured methods and standardizing heterogeneous
experimental tables. We present ResearchPulse, an agent-based framework that
integrates instruction planning, scientific content extraction, and structured
visualization. It consists of three coordinated agents: a Plan Agent for task
decomposition, a Mmap-Agent that constructs motivation-method mind maps, and a
Lchart-Agent that synthesizes experimental line charts. To support this task,
we introduce ResearchPulse-Bench, a citation-aware benchmark of annotated paper
clusters. Experiments show that our system, despite using 7B-scale agents,
consistently outperforms strong baselines like GPT-4o in semantic alignment,
structural consistency, and visual fidelity. The dataset are available in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语音大语言模型(SpeechLMs)由于模态差异，在指令跟随任务中相比纯文本LLMs存在显著性能差距，特别是在处理动态多变的用户语音时。

Method: 采用自合成方法通过强大的教师LLM生成大量高质量对齐数据，然后使用基于强化学习的方法将SpeechLMs的行为与教师模型对齐，避免依赖人工标注的监督微调。

Result: 实验表明该方法有效提升了SpeechLMs的指令跟随能力，在口语问答和语音转文本翻译等任务上达到了最先进的性能，仅使用自生成数据。

Conclusion: RBA框架能够显著缩小语音LLMs与文本LLMs之间的性能差距，为多模态语言模型的发展提供了有效的对齐方法。

Abstract: The recent advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred
considerable research interest in extending their linguistic capabilities
beyond text to other modalities, which leads to emergence of speech-based LLMs
(SpeechLMs) with capability of processing user request in either speech or
textual formats. However, owing to inter-modal discrepancies, these SpeechLMs
still exhibit a significant performance gap compared to their text-based LLM
counterparts in instruction-following, particularly when confronted with the
dynamic and variable nature of user speech. To address this challenge, this
paper introduces a framework termed Reinforced Behavior Alignment (RBA),
designed to bolster the language generation proficiency of SpeechLMs. Instead
of relying on supervised fine-tuning from human annotations, RBA employs a
self-synthesis methodology to generate extensive, high-fidelity alignment data
by a powerful teacher LLM. Then SpeechLMs is aligned its behavior with that of
a teacher using a reinforcement learning-based approach. Experimental results
demonstrate that this method effectively enhances the instruction-following
capabilities of SpeechLMs that outperform conventional distillation baselines.
Crucially, we demonstrate that RBA can be seamlessly extended to tasks such
including spoken question answering and speech-to-text translation, attaining
state-of-the-art performance on open benchmarks with only self-generated data.

Abstract: In the paper, we consider multilevel multitask analysis of cryptocurrency
news using a fine-tuned Mistral 7B large language model with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
  On the first level of analytics, the fine-tuned model generates graph and
text summaries with sentiment scores as well as JSON representations of
summaries. Higher levels perform hierarchical stacking that consolidates sets
of graph-based and text-based summaries as well as summaries of summaries into
comprehensive reports. The combination of graph and text summaries provides
complementary views of cryptocurrency news. The model is fine-tuned with 4-bit
quantization using the PEFT/LoRA approach. The representation of cryptocurrency
news as knowledge graph can essentially eliminate problems with large language
model hallucinations.
  The obtained results demonstrate that the use of fine-tuned Mistral 7B LLM
models for multilevel cryptocurrency news analysis can conduct informative
qualitative and quantitative analytics, providing important insights.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于财务报告，还可推广到其他高风险非脚本通信领域（如远程医疗、教育和政治话语），为多模态话语表示提供了稳健且可解释的方法。

Abstract: Earnings calls represent a uniquely rich and semi-structured source of
financial communication, blending scripted managerial commentary with
unscripted analyst dialogue. Although recent advances in financial sentiment
analysis have integrated multi-modal signals, such as textual content and vocal
tone, most systems rely on flat document-level or sentence-level models,
failing to capture the layered discourse structure of these interactions. This
paper introduces a novel multi-modal framework designed to generate
semantically rich and structurally aware embeddings of earnings calls, by
encoding them as hierarchical discourse trees. Each node, comprising either a
monologue or a question-answer pair, is enriched with emotional signals derived
from text, audio, and video, as well as structured metadata including coherence
scores, topic labels, and answer coverage assessments. A two-stage transformer
architecture is proposed: the first encodes multi-modal content and discourse
metadata at the node level using contrastive learning, while the second
synthesizes a global embedding for the entire conference. Experimental results
reveal that the resulting embeddings form stable, semantically meaningful
representations that reflect affective tone, structural logic, and thematic
alignment. Beyond financial reporting, the proposed system generalizes to other
high-stakes unscripted communicative domains such as tele-medicine, education,
and political discourse, offering a robust and explainable approach to
multi-modal discourse representation. This approach offers practical utility
for downstream tasks such as financial forecasting and discourse evaluation,
while also providing a generalizable method applicable to other domains
involving high-stakes communication.

Motivation: 青少年自杀是主要死因之一，但预测困难，很多案例因缺乏心理健康服务而未被发现。社交媒体提供了实时分析青少年在线表达的机会

Method: 提出Early-SIB模型，使用Transformer结构顺序处理用户写的帖子和互动内容，预测是否会写出自杀意念相关帖子，且输入不包含任何显式自我曝露

Result: 在荷兰青少年论坛数据集上达到平衡准确率0.73，能够有效预测未来的自杀意念行为

Conclusion: 这种早期预测方法可以作为传统方法的有力补充，为青少年自杀防治提供新的技术手段

Abstract: Suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents (12-18), yet predicting
it remains a significant challenge. Many cases go undetected due to a lack of
contact with mental health services. Social media, however, offers a unique
opportunity, as young people often share their thoughts and struggles online in
real time. In this work, we propose a novel task and method to approach it:
predicting suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) from forum posts before an
adolescent explicitly expresses suicidal ideation on an online forum. This
predictive framing, where no self-disclosure is used as input at any stage,
remains largely unexplored in the suicide prediction literature. To this end,
we introduce Early-SIB, a transformer-based model that sequentially processes
the posts a user writes and engages with to predict whether they will write a
SIB post. Our model achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.73 for predicting future
SIB on a Dutch youth forum, demonstrating that such tools can offer a
meaningful addition to traditional methods.

Conclusion: 这种基于实体级标签的方法为可扩展的实时幻觉检测提供了有前景的新方向

Abstract: Large language models are now routinely used in high-stakes applications
where hallucinations can cause serious harm, such as medical consultations or
legal advice. Existing hallucination detection methods, however, are
impractical for real-world use, as they are either limited to short factual
queries or require costly external verification. We present a cheap, scalable
method for real-time identification of hallucinated tokens in long-form
generations, and scale it effectively to 70B parameter models. Our approach
targets \emph{entity-level hallucinations} -- e.g., fabricated names, dates,
citations -- rather than claim-level, thereby naturally mapping to token-level
labels and enabling streaming detection. We develop an annotation methodology
that leverages web search to annotate model responses with grounded labels
indicating which tokens correspond to fabricated entities. This dataset enables
us to train effective hallucination classifiers with simple and efficient
methods such as linear probes. Evaluating across four model families, our
classifiers consistently outperform baselines on long-form responses, including
more expensive methods such as semantic entropy (e.g., AUC 0.90 vs 0.71 for
Llama-3.3-70B), and are also an improvement in short-form question-answering
settings. Moreover, despite being trained only with entity-level labels, our
probes effectively detect incorrect answers in mathematical reasoning tasks,
indicating generalization beyond entities. While our annotation methodology is
expensive, we find that annotated responses from one model can be used to train
effective classifiers on other models; accordingly, we publicly release our
datasets to facilitate reuse. Overall, our work suggests a promising new
approach for scalable, real-world hallucination detection.

Conclusion: UDIB为语义分歧检测框架提供更优基础，是检测LLM幻觉的新型敏感工具

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to critical failure modes, including
\textit{intrinsic faithfulness hallucinations} (also known as confabulations),
where a response deviates semantically from the provided context. Frameworks
designed to detect this, such as Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM), rely on
identifying latent topics shared between prompts and responses, typically by
applying geometric clustering to their sentence embeddings. This creates a
disconnect, as the topics are optimized for spatial proximity, not for the
downstream information-theoretic analysis. In this paper, we bridge this gap by
developing a principled topic identification method grounded in the
Deterministic Information Bottleneck (DIB) for geometric clustering. Our key
contribution is to transform the DIB method into a practical algorithm for
high-dimensional data by substituting its intractable KL divergence term with a
computationally efficient upper bound. The resulting method, which we dub UDIB,
can be interpreted as an entropy-regularized and robustified version of K-means
that inherently favors a parsimonious number of informative clusters. By
applying UDIB to the joint clustering of LLM prompt and response embeddings, we
generate a shared topic representation that is not merely spatially coherent
but is fundamentally structured to be maximally informative about the
prompt-response relationship. This provides a superior foundation for the SDM
framework and offers a novel, more sensitive tool for detecting confabulations.

Conclusion: 该系统有效解决了教育资源丰富但练习材料缺乏的问题，通过多模态自动化生成多样化问题，提升学习效果

Abstract: In today's information-rich era, learners have access to abundant educational
resources, but the lack of practice materials tailored to these resources
presents a significant challenge. This project addresses that gap by developing
a multi-modal question generation system that can automatically generate
diverse question types from various content formats. The system features four
major components: multi-modal input handling, question generation,
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and an end-to-end
interactive interface. This project lays the foundation for automated,
scalable, and intelligent question generation, carefully balancing resource
efficiency, robust functionality and a smooth user experience.

*Cheng-Kai Yeh,Hsing-Wang Lee,Chung-Hung Kuo,Hen-Hsen Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AR²框架通过对抗性强化学习增强LLM的抽象推理能力，使用教师模型将核心问题转化为复杂叙述，训练学生模型提取底层计算逻辑，显著提升模型在未知编程任务上的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成LLM主要关注表面模式识别，缺乏对抽象能力的显式训练，而抽象能力是计算机科学中识别和提炼核心计算模式的关键技能。

Method: 提出AR²对抗性强化学习框架：教师模型将内核问题转化为叙述丰富的挑战性描述但不改变基本逻辑，学生编码模型训练解决这些复杂叙述问题并提取底层计算内核。

Result: 实验结果表明AR²显著提高了学生模型在先前未见过的挑战性编程任务上的准确性

Conclusion: 抽象能力是增强LLM泛化能力的关键技能，AR²框架有效提升了LLM的抽象推理和问题解决能力

Abstract: Abstraction--the ability to recognize and distill essential computational
patterns from complex problem statements--is a foundational skill in computer
science, critical both for human problem-solvers and coding-oriented large
language models (LLMs). Despite recent advances in training LLMs for code
generation using reinforcement learning (RL), most existing approaches focus
primarily on superficial pattern recognition, overlooking explicit training for
abstraction. In this study, we propose AR$^2$ (Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning for Abstract Reasoning), a novel framework explicitly designed to
enhance the abstraction abilities of LLMs. AR$^2$ employs a teacher model to
transform kernel problems into narrative-rich, challenging descriptions without
changing their fundamental logic. Simultaneously, a student coding model is
trained to solve these complex narrative problems by extracting their
underlying computational kernels. Experimental results demonstrate that AR$^2$
substantially improves the student model's accuracy on previously unseen,
challenging programming tasks, underscoring abstraction as a key skill for
enhancing LLM generalization.

TL;DR: 通过动态构建和扩展知识图来提升LLM的事实性回答能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在产生事实一致答案方面存在限制，现有RAG方法将知识作为非结构化文本处理，限制了组合推理和事实不一致性检测能力

Method: 提出一种新框架，在推理时动态构建和扩展知识图，结合LLM内部知识和外部检索的外部信息，通过种子KG提取和迭代扩展进行选择性精炼

Result: 在三个多样化事实QA测试集上评估，在事实准确性、答案精确度和可解释性方面都得到了一致性提升

Conclusion: 推理时知识图构建是一个有前景的方向，能够以结构化、可解释和可扩展的方式提升LLM的事实性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with producing factually
consistent answers due to limitations in their parametric memory.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods address this issue by
incorporating external knowledge from trusted sources at inference time.
However, such methods typically treat knowledge as unstructured text, which
limits their ability to support compositional reasoning and identify factual
inconsistencies. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework
that dynamically constructs and expands knowledge graphs (KGs) during
inference, integrating both internal knowledge extracted from LLMs and external
information retrieved from external sources. Our method begins by extracting a
seed KG from the question via prompting, followed by iterative expansion using
the LLM's latent knowledge. The graph is then selectively refined through
external retrieval, enhancing factual coverage and correcting inaccuracies. We
evaluate our approach on three diverse factual QA benchmarks, demonstrating
consistent improvements in factual accuracy, answer precision, and
interpretability over baseline prompting and static KG-augmented methods. Our
findings suggest that inference-time KG construction is a promising direction
for enhancing LLM factuality in a structured, interpretable, and scalable
manner.

TL;DR: Sprinklr-Edge-OCR是一个专为边缘部署优化的OCR系统，在资源受限环境中表现优异，相比大型视觉语言模型在效率和成本方面具有显著优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言、噪声和多样化真实世界图像中的OCR挑战，特别是在边缘设备资源受限环境下，探索传统OCR系统与大型视觉语言模型的性能对比。

Method: 构建了Sprinklr-Edge-OCR系统，并对5种最先进的LVLM和2种传统OCR系统进行了大规模比较评估，使用包含54种语言的双重人工标注数据集，涵盖准确性、语义一致性、语言覆盖、计算效率和部署成本等多个指标。

Result: Qwen获得最高精度(0.54)，Sprinklr-Edge-OCR获得最佳F1分数(0.46)，处理速度比LVLM快35倍(平均每图0.17秒)，成本仅为LVLM的0.01(每1000张图0.006美元)。

Conclusion: 即使在LLM时代，传统OCR系统由于其低计算需求、低延迟和高性价比，仍然是边缘部署的最佳选择。

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in multilingual, noisy, and diverse
real-world images remains a significant challenge for optical character
recognition systems. With the rise of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs),
there is growing interest in their ability to generalize and reason beyond
fixed OCR pipelines. In this work, we introduce Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, a novel OCR
system built specifically optimized for edge deployment in resource-constrained
environments. We present a large-scale comparative evaluation of five
state-of-the-art LVLMs (InternVL, Qwen, GOT OCR, LLaMA, MiniCPM) and two
traditional OCR systems (Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, SuryaOCR) on a proprietary, doubly
hand annotated dataset of multilingual (54 languages) images. Our benchmark
covers a broad range of metrics including accuracy, semantic consistency,
language coverage, computational efficiency (latency, memory, GPU usage), and
deployment cost. To better reflect real-world applicability, we also conducted
edge case deployment analysis, evaluating model performance on CPU only
environments. Among the results, Qwen achieved the highest precision (0.54),
while Sprinklr-Edge-OCR delivered the best overall F1 score (0.46) and
outperformed others in efficiency, processing images 35 faster (0.17 seconds
per image on average) and at less than 0.01 of the cost (0.006 USD per 1,000
images) compared to LVLM. Our findings demonstrate that the most optimal OCR
systems for edge deployment are the traditional ones even in the era of LLMs
due to their low compute requirements, low latency, and very high
affordability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs作为自动评估器存在自偏好偏差问题，本文通过轻量级引导向量在推理时缓解该问题，无需重新训练，可减少97%的不合理自偏好偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型作为自动评估器时存在自偏好偏差，即倾向于偏好自身输出而非其他模型的输出，这影响了评估管道的公平性和可靠性。

Method: 构建区分合理和不合理自偏好的数据集，使用对比激活加法(CAA)和基于优化的方法构建引导向量，在推理时进行干预。

Result: 引导向量可将不合理自偏好偏差减少高达97%，显著优于提示和直接偏好优化基线方法。

Conclusion: 引导向量在缓解自偏好偏差方面具有潜力但也存在局限性，自偏好可能涉及多个或非线性方向，需要更稳健的干预措施。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as automated evaluators, yet
they suffer from "self-preference bias": a tendency to favor their own outputs
over those of other models. This bias undermines fairness and reliability in
evaluation pipelines, particularly for tasks like preference tuning and model
routing. We investigate whether lightweight steering vectors can mitigate this
problem at inference time without retraining. We introduce a curated dataset
that distinguishes self-preference bias into justified examples of
self-preference and unjustified examples of self-preference, and we construct
steering vectors using two methods: Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and
an optimization-based approach. Our results show that steering vectors can
reduce unjustified self-preference bias by up to 97\%, substantially
outperforming prompting and direct preference optimization baselines. Yet
steering vectors are unstable on legitimate self-preference and unbiased
agreement, implying self-preference spans multiple or nonlinear directions.
This underscores both their promise and limits as safeguards for LLM-as-judges
and motivates more robust interventions.

TL;DR: 通过分析SNOMED CT概念的共现模式和语义向量相似性，探索了两者的关系及在提升临床注释完整性和决策支持中的应用价值


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床笔记包含丰富的临床叙述，但非结构化格式给大规模分析带来挑战。SNOMED CT等标准化术语提高了互操性，但概念间的共现关系和语义相似性仍未得到充分探索

Method: 利用MIMIC-IV数据库，使用标准化相互信息(NPMI)和预训练向量归类法(如ClinicalBERT、BioBERT)分析SNOMED CT概念的共现模式与语义相似性的关系

Result: 共现和语义相似性呈弱相关，但向量归类法能抓取临床意义关联；向量建议的概念经常与后期文档匹配；概念聚类形成了一致的临床主题；共现模式与死亡率、再入院等结果相关

Conclusion: 共现统计和语义向量在改善文档完整性、发现潜在临床关系以及支持决策支持和表型分析应用方面具有互补价值

Abstract: Clinical notes contain rich clinical narratives but their unstructured format
poses challenges for large-scale analysis. Standardized terminologies such as
SNOMED CT improve interoperability, yet understanding how concepts relate
through co-occurrence and semantic similarity remains underexplored. In this
study, we leverage the MIMIC-IV database to investigate the relationship
between SNOMED CT concept co-occurrence patterns and embedding-based semantic
similarity. Using Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) and pretrained
embeddings (e.g., ClinicalBERT, BioBERT), we examine whether frequently
co-occurring concepts are also semantically close, whether embeddings can
suggest missing concepts, and how these relationships evolve temporally and
across specialties. Our analyses reveal that while co-occurrence and semantic
similarity are weakly correlated, embeddings capture clinically meaningful
associations not always reflected in documentation frequency. Embedding-based
suggestions frequently matched concepts later documented, supporting their
utility for augmenting clinical annotations. Clustering of concept embeddings
yielded coherent clinical themes (symptoms, labs, diagnoses, cardiovascular
conditions) that map to patient phenotypes and care patterns. Finally,
co-occurrence patterns linked to outcomes such as mortality and readmission
demonstrate the practical utility of this approach. Collectively, our findings
highlight the complementary value of co-occurrence statistics and semantic
embeddings in improving documentation completeness, uncovering latent clinical
relationships, and informing decision support and phenotyping applications.

Conclusion: MLSD方法通过度量学习有效提升了跨域立场检测的性能，为少样本学习在立场检测任务中的应用提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: We present the novel approach for stance detection across domains and
targets, Metric Learning-Based Few-Shot Learning for Cross-Target and
Cross-Domain Stance Detection (MLSD). MLSD utilizes metric learning with
triplet loss to capture semantic similarities and differences between stance
targets, enhancing domain adaptation. By constructing a discriminative
embedding space, MLSD allows a cross-target or cross-domain stance detection
model to acquire useful examples from new target domains. We evaluate MLSD in
multiple cross-target and cross-domain scenarios across two datasets, showing
statistically significant improvement in stance detection performance across
six widely used stance detection models.

TL;DR: 提出了SiLVERScore，一种基于语义感知嵌入的手语生成评估指标，直接在联合嵌入空间中评估，避免了传统回译方法的两步评估流程问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的手语生成评估采用回译方法，将生成的手语先识别回文本再用文本指标比较，这种方法无法捕捉手语的多模态特性（如面部表情、空间语法、韵律），且难以区分评估错误来自生成模型还是翻译系统。

Method: 提出SiLVERScore指标，在联合嵌入空间中进行语义感知的评估，能够处理语义和韵律变化，并探索跨数据集的泛化挑战。

Result: 在PHOENIX-14T和CSL-Daily数据集上，SiLVERScore在正确对和随机对之间实现了近乎完美的区分（ROC AUC = 0.99，重叠率 < 7%），显著优于传统指标。

Conclusion: SiLVERScore提供了一个更准确、语义感知的手语生成评估方法，解决了传统回译评估的局限性，能够更好地捕捉手语的多模态特性。

Abstract: Evaluating sign language generation is often done through back-translation,
where generated signs are first recognized back to text and then compared to a
reference using text-based metrics. However, this two-step evaluation pipeline
introduces ambiguity: it not only fails to capture the multimodal nature of
sign language-such as facial expressions, spatial grammar, and prosody-but also
makes it hard to pinpoint whether evaluation errors come from sign generation
model or the translation system used to assess it. In this work, we propose
SiLVERScore, a novel semantically-aware embedding-based evaluation metric that
assesses sign language generation in a joint embedding space. Our contributions
include: (1) identifying limitations of existing metrics, (2) introducing
SiLVERScore for semantically-aware evaluation, (3) demonstrating its robustness
to semantic and prosodic variations, and (4) exploring generalization
challenges across datasets. On PHOENIX-14T and CSL-Daily datasets, SiLVERScore
achieves near-perfect discrimination between correct and random pairs (ROC AUC
= 0.99, overlap < 7%), substantially outperforming traditional metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的评测标准主要在单轮或问答场景中评估视觉语言模型，但基础设置是一个交互过程，需要通过持续沟通形成共享理解。

Method: 提出四个指标（基础效率、内容对齐、词汇适应性、人类相似度）来评估VLM在交互式参考游戏中的表现，在150个自我对战影片中测试了三款专有VLM并与人类对比。

Result: 三款模型都在至少三个指标上与人类模式存在差异，GPT4o-mini整体最接近人类。发现任务成功得分不能表示成功基础，高图像-语言对齐也不能预测任务成功。

Conclusion: 该评价套件和发现为未来VLM基础研究提供了框架，强调了在交互场景中系统评估模型基础能力的重要性。

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) increasingly claim reasoning skills, yet
current benchmarks evaluate them in single-turn or question answering settings.
However, grounding is an interactive process in which people gradually develop
shared understanding through ongoing communication. We introduce a four-metric
suite (grounding efficiency, content alignment, lexical adaptation, and
human-likeness) to systematically evaluate VLM performance in interactive
grounding contexts. We deploy the suite on 150 self-play sessions of
interactive referential games between three proprietary VLMs and compare them
with human dyads. All three models diverge from human patterns on at least
three metrics, while GPT4o-mini is the closest overall. We find that (i) task
success scores do not indicate successful grounding and (ii) high
image-utterance alignment does not necessarily predict task success. Our metric
suite and findings offer a framework for future research on VLM grounding.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的文档级机器翻译输出挑战了现有的逐句对齐评估方法，需要新的评估框架来处理超长文档的翻译质量评估。

Method: Align-then-Slide框架包含两个阶段：对齐阶段自动推断句子级源-目标对应关系并重建目标文本；滑动评估阶段使用1-4个chunk的滑动窗口计算平均指标分数进行多粒度评估。

Result: 在WMT基准测试中与专家MQM排名的Pearson相关系数达到0.929；在新构建的真实测试集上也与人工判断高度一致；生成的偏好数据可用于CPO训练和GRPO奖励模型，产生优于普通SFT基线的翻译。

Conclusion: 该框架是文档级机器翻译系统准确、稳健且可操作的评估工具，能够有效解决现有评估方法的局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have ushered in a new era for document-level
machine translation (\textit{doc}-mt), yet their whole-document outputs
challenge existing evaluation methods that assume sentence-by-sentence
alignment. We introduce \textit{\textbf{Align-then-Slide}}, a complete
evaluation framework for ultra-long doc-mt. In the Align stage, we
automatically infer sentence-level source-target correspondences and rebuild
the target to match the source sentence number, resolving omissions and
many-to-one/one-to-many mappings. In the n-Chunk Sliding Evaluate stage, we
calculate averaged metric scores under 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-chunk for
multi-granularity assessment. Experiments on the WMT benchmark show a Pearson
correlation of 0.929 between our method with expert MQM rankings. On a newly
curated real-world test set, our method again aligns closely with human
judgments. Furthermore, preference data produced by Align-then-Slide enables
effective CPO training and its direct use as a reward model for GRPO, both
yielding translations preferred over a vanilla SFT baseline. The results
validate our framework as an accurate, robust, and actionable evaluation tool
for doc-mt systems.

Motivation: 传统的句子级音频深度伪造检测无法实现帧级定位，而利用音频中的语义信息（特别是命名实体）进行部分音频深度伪造检测的研究仍处于探索不足的状态。

Method: 提出NE-PADD方法，包含两个并行分支：语音命名实体识别(SpeechNER)和PADD检测。采用两种注意力聚合机制：注意力融合(AF)用于组合注意力权重，注意力转移(AT)通过辅助损失利用命名实体语义指导PADD。

Result: 在PartialSpoof-NER数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有基线方法，证明了整合命名实体知识在PADD中的有效性。

Conclusion: NE-PADD通过利用命名实体知识显著提升了部分音频深度伪造检测的性能，证明了语义信息在音频伪造检测中的重要价值。

Abstract: Different from traditional sentence-level audio deepfake detection (ADD),
partial audio deepfake detection (PADD) requires frame-level positioning of the
location of fake speech. While some progress has been made in this area,
leveraging semantic information from audio, especially named entities, remains
an underexplored aspect. To this end, we propose NE-PADD, a novel method for
Partial Audio Deepfake Detection (PADD) that leverages named entity knowledge
through two parallel branches: Speech Name Entity Recognition (SpeechNER) and
PADD. The approach incorporates two attention aggregation mechanisms: Attention
Fusion (AF) for combining attention weights and Attention Transfer (AT) for
guiding PADD with named entity semantics using an auxiliary loss. Built on the
PartialSpoof-NER dataset, experiments show our method outperforms existing
baselines, proving the effectiveness of integrating named entity knowledge in
PADD. The code is available at https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/NE-PADD.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了Drivelology（废话学）这一独特语言现象，即表面无意义但蕴含深层含义的表述。研究发现当前大语言模型无法理解这种多层次语义，构建了包含1200多个多语言样本的数据集进行测试，结果显示LLMs在分类、生成和推理任务上存在明显局限。

Motivation: 研究动机是探索大语言模型在处理具有深层含义但表面看似无意义的语言现象时的能力局限，挑战统计流畅性等同于认知理解的假设。

Method: 构建了包含1200多个精心筛选的多语言Drivelology样本数据集，通过专家评审和多轮讨论确保质量，然后评估多种LLMs在分类、生成和推理任务上的表现。

Result: 研究结果显示LLMs存在明显局限性：经常混淆Drivelology与浅层无意义内容，产生不连贯的论证，或完全忽略隐含的修辞功能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在语用理解方面存在深层次表征差距，表明统计流畅性并不等同于认知理解，并发布了数据集和代码以促进超越表面连贯性的语言深度建模研究。

Abstract: We introduce Drivelology, a unique linguistic phenomenon characterised as
"nonsense with depth", utterances that are syntactically coherent yet
pragmatically paradoxical, emotionally loaded, or rhetorically subversive.
While such expressions may resemble surface-level nonsense, they encode
implicit meaning requiring contextual inference, moral reasoning, or emotional
interpretation. We find that current large language models (LLMs), despite
excelling at many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, consistently fail to
grasp the layered semantics of Drivelological text. To investigate this, we
construct a small but diverse benchmark dataset of over 1,200 meticulously
curated examples, with select instances in English, Mandarin, Spanish, French,
Japanese, and Korean. Annotation was especially challenging: each of the
examples required careful expert review to verify that it truly reflected
Drivelological characteristics. The process involved multiple rounds of
discussion and adjudication to address disagreements, highlighting the subtle
and subjective nature of the Drivelology. We evaluate a range of LLMs on
classification, generation, and reasoning tasks. Our results reveal clear
limitations of LLMs: models often confuse Drivelology with shallow nonsense,
produce incoherent justifications, or miss the implied rhetorical function
altogether. These findings highlight a deeper representational gap in LLMs'
pragmatic understanding and challenge the assumption that statistical fluency
implies cognitive comprehension. We release our dataset and code to facilitate
further research in modelling linguistic depth beyond surface-level coherence.

Abstract: The development of Long-CoT reasoning has advanced LLM performance across
various tasks, including language understanding, complex problem solving, and
code generation. This paradigm enables models to generate intermediate
reasoning steps, thereby improving both accuracy and interpretability. However,
despite these advancements, a comprehensive understanding of how CoT-based
reasoning affects the trustworthiness of language models remains
underdeveloped. In this paper, we survey recent work on reasoning models and
CoT techniques, focusing on five core dimensions of trustworthy reasoning:
truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy. For each aspect, we
provide a clear and structured overview of recent studies in chronological
order, along with detailed analyses of their methodologies, findings, and
limitations. Future research directions are also appended at the end for
reference and discussion. Overall, while reasoning techniques hold promise for
enhancing model trustworthiness through hallucination mitigation, harmful
content detection, and robustness improvement, cutting-edge reasoning models
themselves often suffer from comparable or even greater vulnerabilities in
safety, robustness, and privacy. By synthesizing these insights, we hope this
work serves as a valuable and timely resource for the AI safety community to
stay informed on the latest progress in reasoning trustworthiness. A full list

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can comply with harmful instructions, raising
serious safety concerns despite their impressive capabilities. Recent work has
leveraged probing-based approaches to study the separability of malicious and
benign inputs in LLMs' internal representations, and researchers have proposed
using such probing methods for safety detection. We systematically re-examine
this paradigm. Motivated by poor out-of-distribution performance, we
hypothesize that probes learn superficial patterns rather than semantic
harmfulness. Through controlled experiments, we confirm this hypothesis and
identify the specific patterns learned: instructional patterns and trigger
words. Our investigation follows a systematic approach, progressing from
demonstrating comparable performance of simple n-gram methods, to controlled
experiments with semantically cleaned datasets, to detailed analysis of pattern
dependencies. These results reveal a false sense of security around current
probing-based approaches and highlight the need to redesign both models and
evaluation protocols, for which we provide further discussions in the hope of
suggesting responsible further research in this direction. We have open-sourced

TL;DR: MobileRAG是一个基于检索增强生成(RAG)的移动代理框架，通过InterRAG、LocalRAG和MemRAG三个组件解决现有移动代理的局限性，在复杂移动任务上比现有方法提升10.3%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的移动代理存在三个主要问题：1）过度依赖LLM理解能力导致操作错误；2）缺乏外部环境交互，应用无法满足查询时任务终止；3）缺乏记忆能力，无法从错误中学习。

Method: 提出MobileRAG框架，包含InterRAG（交互RAG）、LocalRAG（本地RAG）和MemRAG（记忆RAG），利用RAG技术快速准确识别用户查询并完成复杂移动任务。

Result: 在MobileRAG-Eval基准测试中，MobileRAG能够轻松处理现实世界移动任务，比最先进方法提升10.3%的性能，且操作步骤更少。

Conclusion: MobileRAG通过RAG增强有效解决了当前移动代理的局限性，为复杂移动任务自动化提供了有效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Smartphones have become indispensable in people's daily lives, permeating
nearly every aspect of modern society. With the continuous advancement of large
language models (LLMs), numerous LLM-based mobile agents have emerged. These
agents are capable of accurately parsing diverse user queries and automatically
assisting users in completing complex or repetitive operations. However,
current agents 1) heavily rely on the comprehension ability of LLMs, which can
lead to errors caused by misoperations or omitted steps during tasks, 2) lack
interaction with the external environment, often terminating tasks when an app
cannot fulfill user queries, and 3) lack memory capabilities, requiring each
instruction to reconstruct the interface and being unable to learn from and
correct previous mistakes. To alleviate the above issues, we propose MobileRAG,
a mobile agents framework enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
which includes InterRAG, LocalRAG, and MemRAG. It leverages RAG to more quickly
and accurately identify user queries and accomplish complex and long-sequence
mobile tasks. Additionally, to more comprehensively assess the performance of
MobileRAG, we introduce MobileRAG-Eval, a more challenging benchmark
characterized by numerous complex, real-world mobile tasks that require
external knowledge assistance. Extensive experimental results on MobileRAG-Eval
demonstrate that MobileRAG can easily handle real-world mobile tasks, achieving
10.3\% improvement over state-of-the-art methods with fewer operational steps.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在复杂抽象问题上的推理能力不足问题，充分利用多实体多跳转信息来提升答案准确性

Method: 提出矩阵思维（MoT）结构，通过行列细胞通信机制实现水平和垂直方向的问题探索，并构建知识单元进行事实纠正

Result: 在四个常用数据集上超过最新方法，F1和EM分数更高，推理时间仅为基准方法的14.4%

Conclusion: MoT框架通过高效的矩阵思维结构和知识纠正机制，显著提升了复杂问题回答的准确性和效率

Abstract: Complex Question Answering (QA) is a fundamental and challenging task in NLP.
While large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance in QA, they
suffer from significant performance degradation when facing complex and
abstract QA tasks due to insufficient reasoning capabilities. Works such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) aim to enhance LLMs' reasoning
abilities, but they face issues such as in-layer redundancy in tree structures
and single paths in chain structures. Although some studies utilize
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to assist LLMs in reasoning, the
challenge of effectively utilizing large amounts of information involving
multiple entities and hops remains critical. To address this, we propose the
Matrix of Thought (MoT), a novel and efficient LLM thought structure. MoT
explores the problem in both horizontal and vertical dimensions through the
"column-cell communication" mechanism, enabling LLMs to actively engage in
multi-strategy and deep-level thinking, reducing redundancy within the column
cells and enhancing reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we develop a
fact-correction mechanism by constructing knowledge units from retrieved
knowledge graph triples and raw text to enhance the initial knowledge for LLM
reasoning and correct erroneous answers. This leads to the development of an
efficient and accurate QA framework (MTQA). Experimental results show that our
framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used datasets in
terms of F1 and EM scores, with reasoning time only 14.4\% of the baseline
methods, demonstrating both its efficiency and accuracy. The code for this
framework is available at https://github.com/lyfiter/mtqa.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This study introduces KPoEM (Korean Poetry Emotion Mapping) , a novel dataset
for computational emotion analysis in modern Korean poetry. Despite remarkable
progress in text-based emotion classification using large language models,
poetry-particularly Korean poetry-remains underexplored due to its figurative
language and cultural specificity. We built a multi-label emotion dataset of
7,662 entries, including 7,007 line-level entries from 483 poems and 615
work-level entries, annotated with 44 fine-grained emotion categories from five
influential Korean poets. A state-of-the-art Korean language model fine-tuned
on this dataset significantly outperformed previous models, achieving 0.60
F1-micro compared to 0.34 from models trained on general corpora. The KPoEM
model, trained through sequential fine-tuning-first on general corpora and then
on the KPoEM dataset-demonstrates not only an enhanced ability to identify
temporally and culturally specific emotional expressions, but also a strong
capacity to preserve the core sentiments of modern Korean poetry. This study
bridges computational methods and literary analysis, presenting new
possibilities for the quantitative exploration of poetic emotions through
structured data that faithfully retains the emotional and cultural nuances of
Korean literature.

TL;DR: SelfAug是一种自分布对齐方法，通过在RAG微调中保持模型语义分布来缓解灾难性遗忘问题，在保持通用能力的同时提升下游任务性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有监督微调方法在提升RAG任务性能时会导致灾难性遗忘，使模型失去原有知识和通用能力，且现有解决方案要么需要通用指令数据，要么难以保持模型原始分布。

Method: 提出SelfAug自分布对齐方法，通过将输入序列logits与模型语义分布对齐来缓解灾难性遗忘，无需额外通用指令数据。

Result: 大量实验表明SelfAug在下游学习和通用能力保持之间达到优异平衡，实证分析揭示了分布偏移与灾难性遗忘严重程度之间的直接关联。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅推进了对RAG场景中灾难性遗忘的理解，还提供了适用于各种微调场景的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized
natural language processing through their remarkable capabilities in
understanding and executing diverse tasks. While supervised fine-tuning,
particularly in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios, effectively
enhances task-specific performance, it often leads to catastrophic forgetting,
where models lose their previously acquired knowledge and general capabilities.
Existing solutions either require access to general instruction data or face
limitations in preserving the model's original distribution. To overcome these
limitations, we propose SelfAug, a self-distribution alignment method that
aligns input sequence logits to preserve the model's semantic distribution,
thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting and improving downstream
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SelfAug achieves a superior
balance between downstream learning and general capability retention. Our
comprehensive empirical analysis reveals a direct correlation between
distribution shifts and the severity of catastrophic forgetting in RAG
scenarios, highlighting how the absence of RAG capabilities in general
instruction tuning leads to significant distribution shifts during fine-tuning.
Our findings not only advance the understanding of catastrophic forgetting in
RAG contexts but also provide a practical solution applicable across diverse
fine-tuning scenarios. Our code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPFT-SQL是一种针对Text-to-SQL任务的自博弈微调方法，通过验证驱动的迭代微调和错误驱动损失机制，解决了传统SPIN方法在SQL生成中的局限性，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自博弈微调(SPIN)方法在Text-to-SQL任务中存在局限性：无法生成新信息，且对手模型产生的大量正确SQL查询会降低主模型生成准确SQL的能力。

Method: 提出SPFT-SQL方法：1）自博弈前采用验证驱动的迭代微调，基于数据库模式和验证反馈合成高质量数据；2）自博弈阶段引入错误驱动损失机制，激励对手模型的错误输出，帮助主模型区分正确和错误SQL。

Result: 在6个开源大语言模型和5个基准测试上的实验表明，该方法超越了现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SPFT-SQL通过针对性的改进，有效解决了Text-to-SQL任务中自博弈微调的挑战，为SQL生成任务提供了更有效的训练范式。

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements of self-play fine-tuning (SPIN), which
can transform a weak large language model (LLM) into a strong one through
competitive interactions between models of varying capabilities, it still faces
challenges in the Text-to-SQL task. SPIN does not generate new information, and
the large number of correct SQL queries produced by the opponent model during
self-play reduces the main model's ability to generate accurate SQL queries. To
address this challenge, we propose a new self-play fine-tuning method tailored
for the Text-to-SQL task, called SPFT-SQL. Prior to self-play, we introduce a
verification-based iterative fine-tuning approach, which synthesizes
high-quality fine-tuning data iteratively based on the database schema and
validation feedback to enhance model performance, while building a model base
with varying capabilities. During the self-play fine-tuning phase, we propose
an error-driven loss method that incentivizes incorrect outputs from the
opponent model, enabling the main model to distinguish between correct SQL and
erroneous SQL generated by the opponent model, thereby improving its ability to
generate correct SQL. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses on six
open-source LLMs and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前角色扮演对话代理研究主要关注文本模态，忽略了语音中的副语言特征（语调、韵律、节奏等），且缺乏标准化的评估基准来量化模型在长期角色一致性等核心能力上的表现。

Method: 提出了一个新颖的两阶段自动化流程：首先将电影音频与剧本对齐，然后使用LLM为每个角色系统构建多维配置文件，从而构建VoxRole基准数据集。

Result: 利用VoxRole对当代口语对话模型进行了多维评估，揭示了这些模型在保持角色一致性方面的优势和局限性。

Conclusion: VoxRole填补了语音角色扮演领域长期缺乏标准化评估基准的关键空白，为评估基于语音的角色扮演对话代理提供了首个综合性基准测试资源。

Abstract: Recent significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly
propelled the development of Role-Playing Conversational Agents (RPCAs). These
systems aim to create immersive user experiences through consistent persona
adoption. However, current RPCA research faces dual limitations. First,
existing work predominantly focuses on the textual modality, entirely
overlooking critical paralinguistic features including intonation, prosody, and
rhythm in speech, which are essential for conveying character emotions and
shaping vivid identities. Second, the speech-based role-playing domain suffers
from a long-standing lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. Most current
spoken dialogue datasets target only fundamental capability assessments,
featuring thinly sketched or ill-defined character profiles. Consequently, they
fail to effectively quantify model performance on core competencies like
long-term persona consistency. To address this critical gap, we introduce
VoxRole, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for the
evaluation of speech-based RPCAs. The benchmark comprises 13335 multi-turn
dialogues, totaling 65.6 hours of speech from 1228 unique characters across 261
movies. To construct this resource, we propose a novel two-stage automated
pipeline that first aligns movie audio with scripts and subsequently employs an
LLM to systematically build multi-dimensional profiles for each character.
Leveraging VoxRole, we conduct a multi-dimensional evaluation of contemporary
spoken dialogue models, revealing crucial insights into their respective
strengths and limitations in maintaining persona consistency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型被越来越多地用于事实核查，但其在核查虚假信息方面的有效性仍不确定，特别是在中文语境下缺乏系统性评估。

Method: 构建了CANDY基准测试，包含约2万个精心标注的中文虚假信息实例，使用思维链推理和少样本提示来测试LLMs，并开发分类法来分析模型生成的错误解释。

Result: 当前LLMs在生成准确事实核查结论方面表现有限，最常见的失败模式是事实捏造。LLMs单独使用时不可靠，但作为辅助工具时能显著提升人类表现。

Conclusion: 大语言模型目前还不能独立可靠地进行事实核查，但在作为人类辅助工具时具有很大潜力。CANDY数据集和代码已开源供进一步研究。

Abstract: The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) to fact-check
misinformation remains uncertain, despite their growing use. To this end, we
present CANDY, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the capabilities
and limitations of LLMs in fact-checking Chinese misinformation. Specifically,
we curate a carefully annotated dataset of ~20k instances. Our analysis shows
that current LLMs exhibit limitations in generating accurate fact-checking
conclusions, even when enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot
prompting. To understand these limitations, we develop a taxonomy to categorize
flawed LLM-generated explanations for their conclusions and identify factual
fabrication as the most common failure mode. Although LLMs alone are unreliable
for fact-checking, our findings indicate their considerable potential to
augment human performance when deployed as assistive tools in scenarios. Our
dataset and code can be accessed at https://github.com/SCUNLP/CANDY

Conclusion: 为不充分代表的语言提供了基础性资源，支持更广泛的人工智能语言处理研究和下游应用开发

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) diminishes for extremely
low-resource languages, such as indigenous languages, primarily due to the lack
of labeled data. Despite growing interest, the availability of high-quality
natural language processing (NLP) datasets for these languages remains limited,
making it difficult to develop robust language technologies. This paper
addresses such gap by focusing on Ladin, an endangered Romance language,
specifically targeting the Val Badia variant. Leveraging a small set of
parallel Ladin-Italian sentence pairs, we create synthetic datasets for
sentiment analysis and multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) by translating
monolingual Italian data. To ensure linguistic quality and reliability, we
apply rigorous filtering and back-translation procedures in our method. We
further demonstrate that incorporating these synthetic datasets into machine
translation training leads to substantial improvements over existing
Italian-Ladin translation baselines. Our contributions include the first
publicly available sentiment analysis and MCQA datasets for Ladin, establishing
foundational resources that can support broader NLP research and downstream
applications for this underrepresented language.

Motivation: 当前时序知识图谱问答方法主要关注隐式时序约束，缺乏处理复杂时序查询的能力，且在分解框架中存在推理能力有限和错误传播问题。

Method: RTQA采用递归思维，将问题递归分解为子问题，使用LLMs和TKG知识自底向上求解，并通过多路径答案聚合提高容错性。包含三个核心组件：时序问题分解器、递归求解器和答案聚合器。

Result: 在MultiTQ和TimelineKGQA基准测试中，RTQA在"Multiple"和"Complex"类别上实现了显著的Hits@1提升，优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: RTQA框架通过递归分解和多路径聚合有效解决了复杂时序查询处理中的挑战，无需训练即可实现优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Current temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) methods primarily
focus on implicit temporal constraints, lacking the capability of handling more
complex temporal queries, and struggle with limited reasoning abilities and
error propagation in decomposition frameworks. We propose RTQA, a novel
framework to address these challenges by enhancing reasoning over TKGs without
requiring training. Following recursive thinking, RTQA recursively decomposes
questions into sub-problems, solves them bottom-up using LLMs and TKG
knowledge, and employs multi-path answer aggregation to improve fault
tolerance. RTQA consists of three core components: the Temporal Question
Decomposer, the Recursive Solver, and the Answer Aggregator. Experiments on
MultiTQ and TimelineKGQA benchmarks demonstrate significant Hits@1 improvements
in "Multiple" and "Complex" categories, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在真实世界应用中的表现，因为实际应用涉及语言变异性，需要模型在不同措辞的相同问题下保持有效性。

Method: 系统生成六个常见基准测试中所有问题的多种改写版本，测量34个最先进LLM在不同规模和能力下的效果变化。

Result: LLM在改写输入下的排名相对稳定，但绝对效果分数发生变化且显著下降，表明模型在处理语言变异性方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 基准测试评估的可靠性受到挑战，需要开发更能反映实际部署场景的鲁棒性感知基准测试方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) effectiveness is usually evaluated by means of
benchmarks such as MMLU, ARC-C, or HellaSwag, where questions are presented in
their original wording, thus in a fixed, standardized format. However,
real-world applications involve linguistic variability, requiring models to
maintain their effectiveness across diverse rewordings of the same question or
query. In this study, we systematically assess the robustness of LLMs to
paraphrased benchmark questions and investigate whether benchmark-based
evaluations provide a reliable measure of model capabilities. We systematically
generate various paraphrases of all the questions across six different common
benchmarks, and measure the resulting variations in effectiveness of 34
state-of-the-art LLMs, of different size and effectiveness. Our findings reveal
that while LLM rankings remain relatively stable across paraphrased inputs,
absolute effectiveness scores change, and decline significantly. This suggests
that LLMs struggle with linguistic variability, raising concerns about their
generalization abilities and evaluation methodologies. Furthermore, the
observed performance drop challenges the reliability of benchmark-based
evaluations, indicating that high benchmark scores may not fully capture a
model's robustness to real-world input variations. We discuss the implications
of these findings for LLM evaluation methodologies, emphasizing the need for
robustness-aware benchmarks that better reflect practical deployment scenarios.

Motivation: 系统功能语法理论在中文文本分析中缺乏自动化注释工具，限制了理论的应用和推广，需要开发一个自动化注释系统来填补这一空白。

Method: 研究使用人民日报2014语料库中随机选取4100句话，按照功能语法理论进行手工注释建立数据集，然后基于RoBERTa-Chinese wwm-ext模型进行精调实现命名实体识别任务。

Result: 模型在测试集上达到了F1值0.852，显著超过了其他对比模型。在识别主语(S)、主动词(M)、补语(C)等核心语法元素方面表现优异，但在标签样本不均衡的实体识别上仍有改进空间。

Conclusion: 这项研究首次将功能语法与注意力基于NLP模型相结合，为中文功能语法自动分析提供了新方法，为后续研究奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Systemic Functional Grammar and its branch, Cardiff Grammar, have been widely
applied to discourse analysis, semantic function research, and other tasks
across various languages and texts. However, an automatic annotation system
based on this theory for Chinese texts has not yet been developed, which
significantly constrains the application and promotion of relevant theories. To
fill this gap, this research introduces a functional syntax annotation model
for Chinese based on RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach).
The study randomly selected 4,100 sentences from the People's Daily 2014 corpus
and annotated them according to functional syntax theory to establish a dataset
for training. The study then fine-tuned the RoBERTa-Chinese wwm-ext model based
on the dataset to implement the named entity recognition task, achieving an F1
score of 0.852 on the test set that significantly outperforms other comparative
models. The model demonstrated excellent performance in identifying core
syntactic elements such as Subject (S), Main Verb (M), and Complement (C).
Nevertheless, there remains room for improvement in recognizing entities with
imbalanced label samples. As the first integration of functional syntax with
attention-based NLP models, this research provides a new method for automated
Chinese functional syntax analysis and lays a solid foundation for subsequent
studies.

Abstract: Enhancing the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to interpret sheet music is a crucial step toward
building AI musicians. However, current research lacks both evaluation
benchmarks and training data for sheet music reasoning. To address this, we
propose the idea of synthesizing sheet music problems grounded in music theory,
which can serve both as evaluation benchmarks and as training data for
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We introduce a data
synthesis framework that generates verifiable sheet music questions in both
textual and visual modalities, leading to the Synthetic Sheet Music Reasoning
Benchmark (SSMR-Bench) and a complementary training set. Evaluation results on
SSMR-Bench show the importance of models' reasoning abilities in interpreting
sheet music. At the same time, the poor performance of Gemini 2.5-Pro
highlights the challenges that MLLMs still face in interpreting sheet music in
a visual format. By leveraging synthetic data for RLVR, Qwen3-8B-Base and
Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct achieve improvements on the SSMR-Bench. Besides, the
trained Qwen3-8B-Base surpasses GPT-4 in overall performance on
MusicTheoryBench and achieves reasoning performance comparable to GPT-4 with
the strategies of Role play and Chain-of-Thought. Notably, its performance on
math problems also improves relative to the original Qwen3-8B-Base.
Furthermore, our results show that the enhanced reasoning ability can also
facilitate music composition. In conclusion, we are the first to propose the
idea of synthesizing sheet music problems based on music theory rules, and
demonstrate its effectiveness not only in advancing model reasoning for sheet
music understanding but also in unlocking new possibilities for AI-assisted
music creation.

Abstract: The recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) in general, and in
Natural Language Processing (NLP) in particular, and some of its applications
such as chatbots, have led to their implementation in different domains like
education, healthcare, tourism, and customer service. Since the COVID-19
pandemic, there has been an increasing interest in these digital technologies
to allow and enhance remote access. In education, e-learning systems have been
massively adopted worldwide. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLM) such
as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT
(Generative Pre-trained Transformers) made chatbots even more popular. In this
study, we present a survey on existing Arabic chatbots in education and their
different characteristics such as the adopted approaches, language variety, and
metrics used to measure their performance. We were able to identified some
research gaps when we discovered that, despite the success of chatbots in other
languages such as English, only a few educational Arabic chatbots used modern
techniques. Finally, we discuss future directions of research in this field.

*Rishit Tyagi,Rahul Bouri,Mohit Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个结合BERT分类和GPT-4o推理的系统，用于检测新闻中的隐蔽叙事并生成基于证据的解释，通过辅助知识库提高准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NLP方法难以检测新闻中的微妙措辞和隐藏议程，需要解决多标签叙事分类和生成基于证据的解释这两个关键挑战。

Method: 使用召回导向的BERT模型进行叙事检测，通过GPT-4o管道精炼预测结果；提出ReACT框架进行叙事解释，结合语义检索的少样本提示和结构化分类表作为辅助知识库。

Result: 集成辅助知识的提示方法提高了分类准确性和解释可靠性，在媒体分析、教育和情报收集等领域具有应用价值。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了隐蔽叙事的检测和解释问题，通过知识增强的方法提升了NLP系统在复杂文本分析中的性能。

Abstract: Understanding covert narratives and implicit messaging is essential for
analyzing bias and sentiment. Traditional NLP methods struggle with detecting
subtle phrasing and hidden agendas. This study tackles two key challenges: (1)
multi-label classification of narratives and sub-narratives in news articles,
and (2) generating concise, evidence-based explanations for dominant
narratives. We fine-tune a BERT model with a recall-oriented approach for
comprehensive narrative detection, refining predictions using a GPT-4o pipeline
for consistency. For narrative explanation, we propose a ReACT (Reasoning +
Acting) framework with semantic retrieval-based few-shot prompting, ensuring
grounded and relevant justifications. To enhance factual accuracy and reduce
hallucinations, we incorporate a structured taxonomy table as an auxiliary
knowledge base. Our results show that integrating auxiliary knowledge in
prompts improves classification accuracy and justification reliability, with
applications in media analysis, education, and intelligence gathering.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了如何为对话机器人构建稳定的个性化词汇模型，以支持词汇对齐能力，并确定了最优的词汇模型规模和数据需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 词汇对齐能够促进成功沟通，但在大语言模型新进展背景下，对话机器人中的词汇对齐实现仍然研究不涵。需要构建稳定的个性化词汇模型作为基础。

Method: 通过变更转写语音数据量和各词性类别的词汇项目数量，使用回归率、覆盖率和余弦相似性指标评估模型在不同时间点的性能。

Result: 小型紧凑的词汇模型表现最佳：仅10分钟转写语音数据，包含5个形容词、5个连词、10个副词、名词、代词和动词各自的词汇项目。

Conclusion: 这项研究为构建稳定的个性化词汇模型提供了实用见解，考虑了最小数据需求，是实现对话机器人词汇对齐策略的基础步骤。

Abstract: Lexical alignment, where speakers start to use similar words across
conversation, is known to contribute to successful communication. However, its
implementation in conversational agents remains underexplored, particularly
considering the recent advancements in large language models (LLMs). As a first
step towards enabling lexical alignment in human-agent dialogue, this study
draws on strategies for personalising conversational agents and investigates
the construction of stable, personalised lexical profiles as a basis for
lexical alignment. Specifically, we varied the amounts of transcribed spoken
data used for construction as well as the number of items included in the
profiles per part-of-speech (POS) category and evaluated profile performance
across time using recall, coverage, and cosine similarity metrics. It was shown
that smaller and more compact profiles, created after 10 min of transcribed
speech containing 5 items for adjectives, 5 items for conjunctions, and 10
items for adverbs, nouns, pronouns, and verbs each, offered the best balance in
both performance and data efficiency. In conclusion, this study offers
practical insights into constructing stable, personalised lexical profiles,
taking into account minimal data requirements, serving as a foundational step
toward lexical alignment strategies in conversational agents.

questions generated by an LLM and the answers appearing verbatim in the
Wikipedia articles. We conduct a crowdsourced human evaluation of the fluency
of the generated questions across 30 of the languages, providing evidence that
the questions are of good quality. We evaluate 6 different language models,
both decoder and encoder models of varying sizes, showing that the benchmark is
sufficiently difficult and that there is a large performance discrepancy
amongst the languages. The dataset and survey evaluations are freely available.

TL;DR: 本研究探索了联合建模实体和话语关系的方法，实验证明整合这两种特征能显著提升连贯性评估模型的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有连贯性建模研究大多只关注实体特征或话语关系特征，很少将两者结合，但语言学中连贯性可以通过多种方式实现

Method: 提出了两种联合建模实体和话语关系的方法，在三个基准数据集上进行实验

Result: 实验结果显示整合两种类型的特征显著提升了连贯性模型的性能

Conclusion: 同时建模实体和话语关系对连贯性评估具有重要益处

Abstract: In linguistics, coherence can be achieved by different means, such as by
maintaining reference to the same set of entities across sentences and by
establishing discourse relations between them. However, most existing work on
coherence modeling focuses exclusively on either entity features or discourse
relation features, with little attention given to combining the two. In this
study, we explore two methods for jointly modeling entities and discourse
relations for coherence assessment. Experiments on three benchmark datasets
show that integrating both types of features significantly enhances the
performance of coherence models, highlighting the benefits of modeling both
simultaneously for coherence evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAGneT是一个多智能体框架，用于生成高质量的心理咨询对话数据，通过分解咨询任务到专门化的LLM智能体来提升生成质量，在多个评估维度上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对可扩展心理咨询需求的增长，需要高质量、隐私合规的数据来微调开源大语言模型，但此类数据稀缺。现有单智能体方法难以捕捉真实咨询的结构和细微差别。

Method: 提出MAGneT多智能体框架，将咨询师响应生成分解为协调的子任务，由专门模拟关键心理技术的LLM智能体处理。同时提出统一的评估框架，整合多种自动和专家指标，将评估维度从4个扩展到9个。

Result: MAGneT在生成咨询对话的质量、多样性和治疗对齐方面显著优于现有方法，平均提升一般咨询技能3.2%、CBT特定技能4.3%。专家在77.2%的情况下偏好MAGneT生成的对话。使用MAGneT数据微调的模型性能更好，平均提升6.3%的一般咨询技能和7.3%的CBT特定技能。

Conclusion: MAGneT框架能有效生成高质量的心理咨询对话数据，解决了数据稀缺问题，并通过多智能体协作和全面评估机制显著提升了生成质量，为心理咨询LLM的微调提供了优质数据源。

Abstract: The growing demand for scalable psychological counseling highlights the need
for fine-tuning open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) with high-quality,
privacy-compliant data, yet such data remains scarce. Here we introduce MAGneT,
a novel multi-agent framework for synthetic psychological counseling session
generation that decomposes counselor response generation into coordinated
sub-tasks handled by specialized LLM agents, each modeling a key psychological
technique. Unlike prior single-agent approaches, MAGneT better captures the
structure and nuance of real counseling. In addition, we address
inconsistencies in prior evaluation protocols by proposing a unified evaluation
framework integrating diverse automatic and expert metrics. Furthermore, we
expand the expert evaluations from four aspects of counseling in previous works
to nine aspects, enabling a more thorough and robust assessment of data
quality. Empirical results show that MAGneT significantly outperforms existing
methods in quality, diversity, and therapeutic alignment of the generated
counseling sessions, improving general counseling skills by 3.2% and
CBT-specific skills by 4.3% on average on cognitive therapy rating scale
(CTRS). Crucially, experts prefer MAGneT-generated sessions in 77.2% of cases
on average across all aspects. Moreover, fine-tuning an open-source model on
MAGneT-generated sessions shows better performance, with improvements of 6.3%
on general counseling skills and 7.3% on CBT-specific skills on average on CTRS
over those fine-tuned with sessions generated by baseline methods. We also make
our code and data public.

TL;DR: SED-Aug是一个用于社交媒体事件检测的即插即用双增强框架，通过显式文本增强和隐式特征空间增强来提高数据多样性和模型鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体事件检测依赖标注数据，但标注成本高且劳动密集，需要解决数据稀缺问题

Method: 结合显式文本增强（使用大语言模型的5种生成策略）和隐式特征空间增强（5种新颖的扰动技术，在结构融合嵌入上操作）

Result: 在Twitter2012数据集上平均F1分数比最佳基线模型提高约17.67%，在Twitter2018数据集上提高约15.57%

Conclusion: SED-Aug框架有效提升了社交媒体事件检测性能，通过双重增强策略解决了数据稀缺问题

Abstract: Social event detection involves identifying and categorizing important events
from social media, which relies on labeled data, but annotation is costly and
labor-intensive. To address this problem, we propose Augmentation framework for
Social Event Detection (SED-Aug), a plug-and-play dual augmentation framework,
which combines explicit text-based and implicit feature-space augmentation to
enhance data diversity and model robustness. The explicit augmentation utilizes
large language models to enhance textual information through five diverse
generation strategies. For implicit augmentation, we design five novel
perturbation techniques that operate in the feature space on structural fused
embeddings. These perturbations are crafted to keep the semantic and relational
properties of the embeddings and make them more diverse. Specifically, SED-Aug
outperforms the best baseline model by approximately 17.67% on the Twitter2012
dataset and by about 15.57% on the Twitter2018 dataset in terms of the average
F1 score. The code is available at GitHub: https://github.com/congboma/SED-Aug.

TL;DR: 提出了Inverse IFEval基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在对抗性指令下的反直觉能力，发现现有模型存在认知惯性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在监督微调后往往表现出认知惯性，难以遵循与训练模式相冲突的指令，需要评估这种局限性。

Method: 构建包含1012个中英文问题的数据集，涵盖8种挑战类型，采用人类参与的数据构建流程和优化的LLM-as-a-Judge评估框架。

Result: 实验表明现有领先LLMs在反直觉能力方面存在不足，验证了Inverse IFEval基准的必要性。

Conclusion: 未来的对齐工作不仅要追求流畅性和事实正确性，还应考虑在非常规情境下的适应性，Inverse IFEval可作为诊断工具和开发方法的基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on diverse tasks but
often exhibit cognitive inertia, struggling to follow instructions that
conflict with the standardized patterns learned during supervised fine-tuning
(SFT). To evaluate this limitation, we propose Inverse IFEval, a benchmark that
measures models Counter-intuitive Abilitytheir capacity to override
training-induced biases and comply with adversarial instructions. Inverse
IFEval introduces eight types of such challenges, including Question
Correction, Intentional Textual Flaws, Code without Comments, and
Counterfactual Answering. Using a human-in-the-loop pipeline, we construct a
dataset of 1012 high-quality Chinese and English questions across 23 domains,
evaluated under an optimized LLM-as-a-Judge framework. Experiments on existing
leading LLMs demonstrate the necessity of our proposed Inverse IFEval
benchmark. Our findings emphasize that future alignment efforts should not only
pursue fluency and factual correctness but also account for adaptability under
unconventional contexts. We hope that Inverse IFEval serves as both a
diagnostic tool and a foundation for developing methods that mitigate cognitive
inertia, reduce overfitting to narrow patterns, and ultimately enhance the
instruction-following reliability of LLMs in diverse and unpredictable
real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 该研究创建了两个医学问答数据集来评估LLMs在医学知识更新方面的表现，发现所有主流模型都存在依赖过时知识的问题，并分析了原因和提出了改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗领域的应用潜力巨大，但其依赖静态训练数据的特性可能导致提供过时的医疗建议，存在安全隐患。需要系统评估LLMs处理医学知识更新的能力。

Method: 构建了两个新颖的问答数据集：MedRevQA（16,501个QA对，涵盖一般生物医学知识）和MedChangeQA（512个QA对，专门针对医学共识随时间变化的案例）。评估了8个主流LLM模型在这些数据集上的表现。

Result: 所有被评估的LLM模型都表现出对过时知识的一致依赖，无法有效处理医学共识变化的情况。研究还分析了过时预训练数据和训练策略对这一现象的影响。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在医学知识更新方面的重要局限性，为开发更及时可靠的医疗AI系统奠定了基础，并提出了相应的缓解方向和未来研究路径。

Abstract: The growing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant
potential to enhance healthcare by assisting medical researchers and
physicians. However, their reliance on static training data is a major risk
when medical recommendations evolve with new research and developments. When
LLMs memorize outdated medical knowledge, they can provide harmful advice or
fail at clinical reasoning tasks. To investigate this problem, we introduce two
novel question-answering (QA) datasets derived from systematic reviews:
MedRevQA (16,501 QA pairs covering general biomedical knowledge) and
MedChangeQA (a subset of 512 QA pairs where medical consensus has changed over
time). Our evaluation of eight prominent LLMs on the datasets reveals
consistent reliance on outdated knowledge across all models. We additionally
analyze the influence of obsolete pre-training data and training strategies to
explain this phenomenon and propose future directions for mitigation, laying
the groundwork for developing more current and reliable medical AI systems.

TL;DR: PARCO是一个通过音素增强和对比实体消歧的上下文ASR方法，显著提升了领域特定命名实体识别性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ASR系统在领域特定命名实体识别上表现不佳，特别是同音词问题。现有上下文ASR方法因实体多样性有限而无法捕捉细粒度音素变化，且将实体作为独立token处理导致多token偏置不完整

Method: 提出PARCO方法，整合音素感知编码、对比实体消歧、实体级监督和分层实体过滤，增强音素区分能力，确保完整实体检索并减少误报

Result: 在中文AISHELL-1上CER达到4.22%，英文DATA2上WER为11.14%（1000个干扰项下），显著优于基线方法。在THCHS-30和LibriSpeech等域外数据集上也表现出稳健增益

Conclusion: PARCO通过音素增强和对比学习有效解决了ASR中命名实体识别问题，特别是在处理同音词和多token实体方面表现出色，具有很好的泛化能力

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems struggle with domain-specific
named entities, especially homophones. Contextual ASR improves recognition but
often fails to capture fine-grained phoneme variations due to limited entity
diversity. Moreover, prior methods treat entities as independent tokens,
leading to incomplete multi-token biasing. To address these issues, we propose
Phoneme-Augmented Robust Contextual ASR via COntrastive entity disambiguation
(PARCO), which integrates phoneme-aware encoding, contrastive entity
disambiguation, entity-level supervision, and hierarchical entity filtering.
These components enhance phonetic discrimination, ensure complete entity
retrieval, and reduce false positives under uncertainty. Experiments show that
PARCO achieves CER of 4.22% on Chinese AISHELL-1 and WER of 11.14% on English
DATA2 under 1,000 distractors, significantly outperforming baselines. PARCO
also demonstrates robust gains on out-of-domain datasets like THCHS-30 and
LibriSpeech.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在社会影响场景中的应用增加，性别偏见问题日益受到关注，但现有评估方法往往使用与自然语言分布不同的任务提示，可能影响测量结果的真实性

Method: 通过设计不同提示条件测试模型：(1)突出测试语境，(2)突出性别相关内容；使用四种任务格式，结合token概率和离散选择指标进行评估

Result: 即使微小的提示词变化也能显著改变偏见结果，有时会完全反转偏见方向；离散选择指标倾向于比概率测量放大偏见

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM性别偏见评估的脆弱性，提出了关于测试设计触发LLM"测试模式"性能程度的新问题，对未来基准测试的生态有效性具有重要意义

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly applied in socially impactful settings, concerns
about gender bias have prompted growing efforts both to measure and mitigate
such bias. These efforts often rely on evaluation tasks that differ from
natural language distributions, as they typically involve carefully constructed
task prompts that overtly or covertly signal the presence of gender
bias-related content. In this paper, we examine how signaling the evaluative
purpose of a task impacts measured gender bias in LLMs. Concretely, we test
models under prompt conditions that (1) make the testing context salient, and
(2) make gender-focused content salient. We then assess prompt sensitivity
across four task formats with both token-probability and discrete-choice
metrics. We find that even minor prompt changes can substantially alter bias
outcomes, sometimes reversing their direction entirely. Discrete-choice metrics
further tend to amplify bias relative to probabilistic measures. These findings
do not only highlight the brittleness of LLM gender bias evaluations but open a
new puzzle for the NLP benchmarking and development community: To what extent
can well-controlled testing designs trigger LLM ``testing mode'' performance,
and what does this mean for the ecological validity of future benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要集中在公历上，而许多非公历系统(如日本历、希吉来历、希伯来历)仍在活跃使用且反映文化特定时间观念，需要评估语言模型对这些非公历的处理能力。

Method: 创建了四个需要时间知识和时间推理的任务数据集，对一系列英语中心和日语中心的开源语言模型进行系统性评测，以日本历为例。

Result: 发现部分模型能够进行历法转换，但即使日语专用模型也在日本历算术运算和不同历法间的一致性维持方面遇到困难。

Conclusion: 结果强调了开发更好处理文化特定历法理解的语言模型的重要性，指出当前模型在多元文化时间观念处理方面的不足。

Abstract: Temporal reasoning and knowledge are essential capabilities for language
models (LMs). While much prior work has analyzed and improved temporal
reasoning in LMs, most studies have focused solely on the Gregorian calendar.
However, many non-Gregorian systems, such as the Japanese, Hijri, and Hebrew
calendars, are in active use and reflect culturally grounded conceptions of
time. If and how well current LMs can accurately handle such non-Gregorian
calendars has not been evaluated so far. Here, we present a systematic
evaluation of how well open-source LMs handle one such non-Gregorian system:
the Japanese calendar. For our evaluation, we create datasets for four tasks
that require both temporal knowledge and temporal reasoning. Evaluating a range
of English-centric and Japanese-centric LMs, we find that some models can
perform calendar conversions, but even Japanese-centric models struggle with
Japanese-calendar arithmetic and with maintaining consistency across calendars.
Our results highlight the importance of developing LMs that are better equipped
for culture-specific calendar understanding.

Conclusion: 页面图模型能够显著提升GUI代理的环境感知咃演继性能，PG-Agent框架在限制数据条件下仍能实现良好的性能。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents possess significant commercial and
social value, and GUI agents powered by advanced multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential. Currently, existing GUI
agents usually utilize sequential episodes of multi-step operations across
pages as the prior GUI knowledge, which fails to capture the complex transition
relationship between pages, making it challenging for the agents to deeply
perceive the GUI environment and generalize to new scenarios. Therefore, we
design an automated pipeline to transform the sequential episodes into page
graphs, which explicitly model the graph structure of the pages that are
naturally connected by actions. To fully utilize the page graphs, we further
introduce Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to effectively
retrieve reliable perception guidelines of GUI from them, and a tailored
multi-agent framework PG-Agent with task decomposition strategy is proposed to
be injected with the guidelines so that it can generalize to unseen scenarios.
Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of
PG-Agent, even with limited episodes for page graph construction.

Conclusion: 该新算法能够简化多线性规划的构建，并通过列生成技术高效地计算概率界限，为部分可识别因果查询提供了更优科学的解决方案

Abstract: We investigate partially identifiable queries in a class of causal models. We
focus on acyclic Structural Causal Models that are quasi-Markovian (that is,
each endogenous variable is connected with at most one exogenous confounder).
We look into scenarios where endogenous variables are observed (and a
distribution over them is known), while exogenous variables are not fully
specified. This leads to a representation that is in essence a Bayesian network
where the distribution of root variables is not uniquely determined. In such
circumstances, it may not be possible to precisely compute a probability value
of interest. We thus study the computation of tight probability bounds, a
problem that has been solved by multilinear programming in general, and by
linear programming when a single confounded component is intervened upon. We
present a new algorithm to simplify the construction of such programs by
exploiting input probabilities over endogenous variables. For scenarios with a
single intervention, we apply column generation to compute a probability bound
through a sequence of auxiliary linear integer programs, thus showing that a
representation with polynomial cardinality for exogenous variables is possible.
Experiments show column generation techniques to be superior to existing
methods.

Abstract: In the context of continuously rising global air traffic, efficient and safe
Conflict Detection and Resolution (CD&R) is paramount for air traffic
management. Although Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising
pathway for CD&R automation, existing approaches commonly suffer from a
"unimodal bias" in their policies. This leads to a critical lack of
decision-making flexibility when confronted with complex and dynamic
constraints, often resulting in "decision deadlocks." To overcome this
limitation, this paper pioneers the integration of diffusion probabilistic
models into the safety-critical task of CD&R, proposing a novel autonomous
conflict resolution framework named Diffusion-AC. Diverging from conventional
methods that converge to a single optimal solution, our framework models its
policy as a reverse denoising process guided by a value function, enabling it
to generate a rich, high-quality, and multimodal action distribution. This core
architecture is complemented by a Density-Progressive Safety Curriculum (DPSC),
a training mechanism that ensures stable and efficient learning as the agent
progresses from sparse to high-density traffic environments. Extensive
simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
outperforms a suite of state-of-the-art DRL benchmarks. Most critically, in the
most challenging high-density scenarios, Diffusion-AC not only maintains a high
success rate of 94.1% but also reduces the incidence of Near Mid-Air Collisions
(NMACs) by approximately 59% compared to the next-best-performing baseline,
significantly enhancing the system's safety margin. This performance leap stems
from its unique multimodal decision-making capability, which allows the agent
to flexibly switch to effective alternative maneuvers.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了动态规划框架，让LLM智能体能够灵活决定何时进行规划，通过监督微调和强化学习两阶段训练，在长时程任务中实现更高效的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如ReAct要求LLM在每次行动前都进行规划，这在计算上昂贵且在长时程任务中性能下降，而完全不规划又会限制性能，因此需要动态规划能力。

Method: 提出两阶段训练流程：1）在多样化合成数据上进行监督微调，为动态规划做准备；2）在长时程环境中使用强化学习来精炼这种能力。

Result: 在Crafter环境中的实验表明，动态规划智能体更样本高效，能持续实现更复杂的目标，并且可以通过人类编写的规划进行有效引导。

Conclusion: 这是首个探索训练LLM智能体进行动态测试时计算分配的研究，为更高效、自适应和可控的智能体系统开辟了道路。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) to reason via reinforcement learning
(RL) significantly improves their problem-solving capabilities. In agentic
settings, existing methods like ReAct prompt LLMs to explicitly plan before
every action; however, we demonstrate that always planning is computationally
expensive and degrades performance on long-horizon tasks, while never planning
further limits performance. To address this, we introduce a conceptual
framework formalizing dynamic planning for LLM agents, enabling them to
flexibly decide when to allocate test-time compute for planning. We propose a
simple two-stage training pipeline: (1) supervised fine-tuning on diverse
synthetic data to prime models for dynamic planning, and (2) RL to refine this
capability in long-horizon environments. Experiments on the Crafter environment
show that dynamic planning agents trained with this approach are more
sample-efficient and consistently achieve more complex objectives.
Additionally, we demonstrate that these agents can be effectively steered by
human-written plans, surpassing their independent capabilities. To our
knowledge, this work is the first to explore training LLM agents for dynamic
test-time compute allocation in sequential decision-making tasks, paving the
way for more efficient, adaptive, and controllable agentic systems.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型产生幻觉和不可验证声明的问题，特别是在医疗等敏感领域需要高精度的场景下，RAG系统虽然能提高准确性但仍缺乏透明度。

Method: 开发了方法无关的基于扰动的框架，通过受控扰动、相似度计算和训练加权线性代理模型，识别图实体和关系对生成输出的影响。

Conclusion: 该框架能够在保持模型有效性的同时提供可解释性，促进机器学习技术的透明度和信任度。

Abstract: Generative AI, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), has achieved impressive
progress but still produces hallucinations and unverifiable claims, limiting
reliability in sensitive domains. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves
accuracy by grounding outputs in external knowledge, especially in domains like
healthcare, where precision is vital. However, RAG remains opaque and
essentially a black box, heavily dependent on data quality. We developed a
method-agnostic, perturbation-based framework that provides token and
component-level interoperability for Graph RAG using SMILE and named it as
Knowledge-Graph (KG)-SMILE. By applying controlled perturbations, computing
similarities, and training weighted linear surrogates, KG-SMILE identifies the
graph entities and relations most influential to generated outputs, thereby
making RAG more transparent. We evaluate KG-SMILE using comprehensive
attribution metrics, including fidelity, faithfulness, consistency, stability,
and accuracy. Our findings show that KG-SMILE produces stable, human-aligned
explanations, demonstrating its capacity to balance model effectiveness with
interpretability and thereby fostering greater transparency and trust in
machine learning technologies.

Abstract: Reasoning requires adaptation to novel problem settings under limited data
and distribution shift. This work introduces CausalARC: an experimental testbed
for AI reasoning in low-data and out-of-distribution regimes, modeled after the
Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). Each CausalARC reasoning task is
sampled from a fully specified causal world model, formally expressed as a
structural causal model. Principled data augmentations provide observational,
interventional, and counterfactual feedback about the world model in the form
of few-shot, in-context learning demonstrations. As a proof-of-concept, we
illustrate the use of CausalARC for four language model evaluation settings:
(1) abstract reasoning with test-time training, (2) counterfactual reasoning
with in-context learning, (3) program synthesis, and (4) causal discovery with
logical reasoning.

Motivation: 大语言模型在逻辑推理方面存在错误，缺乏人类类似的健壮心智表征。需要基于体验的认知结构来改善理解和推理能力。

Method: 使用图像模式基础的表征来基于理解和逻辑推理，通过声明式空间推理在回答集编程中实现。将这些认知结构形式化为可执行程序。

Result: 在逻辑执推问题上评估显示，可以引导LLMs通过体验认知结构来解释场景，这些结构能够形式化为可执行程序，并支持有效的逻辑推理且提高了可解释性。

Conclusion: 虽然当前实现主要关注空间原语，但为融入更复杂和动态表征建立了计算基础，证明了通过体验认知结构改善LLMs逻辑推理的可行性。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in natural language understanding, Large
Language Models (LLMs) remain error-prone when performing logical reasoning,
often lacking the robust mental representations that enable human-like
comprehension. We introduce a prototype neurosymbolic system, Embodied-LM, that
grounds understanding and logical reasoning in schematic representations based
on image schemas-recurring patterns derived from sensorimotor experience that
structure human cognition. Our system operationalizes the spatial foundations
of these cognitive structures using declarative spatial reasoning within Answer
Set Programming. Through evaluation on logical deduction problems, we
demonstrate that LLMs can be guided to interpret scenarios through embodied
cognitive structures, that these structures can be formalized as executable
programs, and that the resulting representations support effective logical
reasoning with enhanced interpretability. While our current implementation
focuses on spatial primitives, it establishes the computational foundation for
incorporating more complex and dynamic representations.

Motivation: 虽然强化学习能有效提升大语言模型的复杂推理能力，但其成功背后的机制仍不明确，需要深入理解学习过程中的关键动态和瓶颈。

Method: 通过分析发现推理层次结构，提出HIerarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA)算法，专注于高层战略规划token的优化，并使用语义熵作为战略探索的衡量指标。

Result: HICRA算法显著优于现有基线方法，证明专注于战略瓶颈是解锁高级推理的关键，语义熵被验证为比token级熵更优越的战略探索衡量指标。

Conclusion: 强化学习提升LLM推理能力的关键在于识别和优化层次化推理结构中的战略规划层面，HICRA算法通过针对性的信用分配机制有效解决了现有方法的效率问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven highly effective at enhancing the
complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet underlying
mechanisms driving this success remain largely opaque. Our analysis reveals
that puzzling phenomena like ``aha moments", ``length-scaling'' and entropy
dynamics are not disparate occurrences but hallmarks of an emergent reasoning
hierarchy, akin to the separation of high-level strategic planning from
low-level procedural execution in human cognition. We uncover a compelling
two-phase dynamic: initially, a model is constrained by procedural correctness
and must improve its low-level skills. The learning bottleneck then decisively
shifts, with performance gains being driven by the exploration and mastery of
high-level strategic planning. This insight exposes a core inefficiency in
prevailing RL algorithms like GRPO, which apply optimization pressure
agnostically and dilute the learning signal across all tokens. To address this,
we propose HIerarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA), an algorithm that
concentrates optimization efforts on high-impact planning tokens. HICRA
significantly outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating that focusing on this
strategic bottleneck is key to unlocking advanced reasoning. Furthermore, we
validate semantic entropy as a superior compass for measuring strategic
exploration over misleading metrics such as token-level entropy.

Motivation: SHAP方法在长时序数据中计算复杂度高，现有研究通过分段聚合降低计算成本，但最优分段策略选择仍是一个开放问题

Method: 研究8种不同时间序列分割算法，使用InterpretTime和AUC Difference两种评估方法，在多元和单变量时间序列上进行实验

Result: 分段数量对解释质量影响大于具体分段方法，等长分段表现优于大多数定制算法，提出的长度加权归一化技术能持续提升归因质量

Conclusion: 对于时间序列SHAP解释，简单的等长分段配合长度加权归一化是最有效的策略，分段数量是关键因素而非复杂的分段算法

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) has become an increasingly important topic for
understanding and attributing the predictions made by complex Time Series
Classification (TSC) models. Among attribution methods, SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP) is widely regarded as an excellent attribution method; but
its computational complexity, which scales exponentially with the number of
features, limits its practicality for long time series. To address this, recent
studies have shown that aggregating features via segmentation, to compute a
single attribution value for a group of consecutive time points, drastically
reduces SHAP running time. However, the choice of the optimal segmentation
strategy remains an open question. In this work, we investigated eight
different Time Series Segmentation algorithms to understand how segment
compositions affect the explanation quality. We evaluate these approaches using
two established XAI evaluation methodologies: InterpretTime and AUC Difference.
Through experiments on both Multivariate (MTS) and Univariate Time Series
(UTS), we find that the number of segments has a greater impact on explanation
quality than the specific segmentation method. Notably, equal-length
segmentation consistently outperforms most of the custom time series
segmentation algorithms. Furthermore, we introduce a novel attribution
normalisation technique that weights segments by their length and we show that
it consistently improves attribution quality.

Abstract: Recent developments in AI governance and safety research have called for
red-teaming methods that can effectively surface potential risks posed by AI
models. Many of these calls have emphasized how the identities and backgrounds
of red-teamers can shape their red-teaming strategies, and thus the kinds of
risks they are likely to uncover. While automated red-teaming approaches
promise to complement human red-teaming by enabling larger-scale exploration of
model behavior, current approaches do not consider the role of identity. As an
initial step towards incorporating people's background and identities in
automated red-teaming, we develop and evaluate a novel method, PersonaTeaming,
that introduces personas in the adversarial prompt generation process to
explore a wider spectrum of adversarial strategies. In particular, we first
introduce a methodology for mutating prompts based on either "red-teaming
expert" personas or "regular AI user" personas. We then develop a dynamic
persona-generating algorithm that automatically generates various persona types
adaptive to different seed prompts. In addition, we develop a set of new
metrics to explicitly measure the "mutation distance" to complement existing
diversity measurements of adversarial prompts. Our experiments show promising
improvements (up to 144.1%) in the attack success rates of adversarial prompts
through persona mutation, while maintaining prompt diversity, compared to
RainbowPlus, a state-of-the-art automated red-teaming method. We discuss the
strengths and limitations of different persona types and mutation methods,
shedding light on future opportunities to explore complementarities between
automated and human red-teaming approaches.

Motivation: 理解LLM是否表现出类似人类的人格特质模式，以及这些特质是否能预测行为，此前研究主要依赖简化的自报告和启发式提示，缺乏行为验证

Method: 从三个维度系统分析LLM人格：(1)训练阶段特质配置的动态演变；(2)自报告特质在行为任务中的预测效度；(3)人格注入等干预措施对自报告和行为的影响

Result: 指令对齐显著稳定特质表达并增强特质相关性，但自报告特质无法可靠预测行为，人格注入能成功引导自报告但对实际行为影响有限或不一致

Conclusion: 研究挑战了关于LLM人格的假设，强调需要区分表面特质表达和行为一致性，在对齐和可解释性方面需要更深入的评估

Abstract: Personality traits have long been studied as predictors of human
behavior.Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest similar
patterns may emerge in artificial systems, with advanced LLMs displaying
consistent behavioral tendencies resembling human traits like agreeableness and
self-regulation. Understanding these patterns is crucial, yet prior work
primarily relied on simplified self-reports and heuristic prompting, with
little behavioral validation. In this study, we systematically characterize LLM
personality across three dimensions: (1) the dynamic emergence and evolution of
trait profiles throughout training stages; (2) the predictive validity of
self-reported traits in behavioral tasks; and (3) the impact of targeted
interventions, such as persona injection, on both self-reports and behavior.
Our findings reveal that instructional alignment (e.g., RLHF, instruction
tuning) significantly stabilizes trait expression and strengthens trait
correlations in ways that mirror human data. However, these self-reported
traits do not reliably predict behavior, and observed associations often
diverge from human patterns. While persona injection successfully steers
self-reports in the intended direction, it exerts little or inconsistent effect
on actual behavior. By distinguishing surface-level trait expression from
behavioral consistency, our findings challenge assumptions about LLM
personality and underscore the need for deeper evaluation in alignment and
interpretability.

Result: 发现不同模型家族和规模的LLM都存在显著的内部不一致性，无法准确替代真实人类研究参与者。

Conclusion: LLM代理虽然能生成人类般的回答，但缺乏内部一致性，这是其作为人类研究替代品的关键能力缺陷。

Abstract: The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have fueled the
notion that synthetic agents can serve as substitutes for real participants in
human-subject research. In an effort to evaluate the merits of this claim,
social science researchers have largely focused on whether LLM-generated survey
data corresponds to that of a human counterpart whom the LLM is prompted to
represent. In contrast, we address a more fundamental question: Do agents
maintain internal consistency, retaining similar behaviors when examined under
different experimental settings? To this end, we develop a study designed to
(a) reveal the agent's internal state and (b) examine agent behavior in a basic
dialogue setting. This design enables us to explore a set of behavioral
hypotheses to assess whether an agent's conversation behavior is consistent
with what we would expect from their revealed internal state. Our findings on
these hypotheses show significant internal inconsistencies in LLMs across model
families and at differing model sizes. Most importantly, we find that, although
agents may generate responses matching those of their human counterparts, they
fail to be internally consistent, representing a critical gap in their
capabilities to accurately substitute for real participants in human-subject
research. Our simulation code and data are publicly accessible.

Abstract: Accuracy and safety are paramount in Offshore Wind (OSW) maintenance, yet
conventional Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail when confronted with
highly specialised or unexpected scenarios. We introduce RAGuard, an enhanced
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that explicitly integrates
safety-critical documents alongside technical manuals.By issuing parallel
queries to two indices and allocating separate retrieval budgets for knowledge
and safety, RAGuard guarantees both technical depth and safety coverage. We
further develop a SafetyClamp extension that fetches a larger candidate pool,
"hard-clamping" exact slot guarantees to safety. We evaluate across sparse
(BM25), dense (Dense Passage Retrieval) and hybrid retrieval paradigms,
measuring Technical Recall@K and Safety Recall@K. Both proposed extensions of
RAG show an increase in Safety Recall@K from almost 0\% in RAG to more than
50\% in RAGuard, while maintaining Technical Recall above 60\%. These results
demonstrate that RAGuard and SafetyClamp have the potential to establish a new
standard for integrating safety assurance into LLM-powered decision support in
critical maintenance contexts.

Abstract: In supply chain management, planning is a critical concept. The movement of
physical products across different categories, from suppliers to warehouse
management, to sales, and logistics transporting them to customers, entails the
involvement of many entities. It covers various aspects such as demand
forecasting, inventory management, sales operations, and replenishment. How to
collect relevant data from an e-commerce platform's perspective, formulate
long-term plans, and dynamically adjust them based on environmental changes,
while ensuring interpretability, efficiency, and reliability, is a practical
and challenging problem. In recent years, the development of AI technologies,
especially the rapid progress of large language models, has provided new tools
to address real-world issues. In this work, we construct a Supply Chain
Planning Agent (SCPA) framework that can understand domain knowledge,
comprehend the operator's needs, decompose tasks, leverage or create new tools,
and return evidence-based planning reports. We deploy this framework in
JD.com's real-world scenario, demonstrating the feasibility of LLM-agent
applications in the supply chain. It effectively reduced labor and improved

Conclusion: 这项工作为多智能体LLM系统提供了学习自适应元认知策略的新范式，从设计固定协议转向学习动态审议策略

Abstract: Multi-agent systems of large language models (LLMs) show promise for complex
reasoning, but their effectiveness is often limited by fixed collaboration
protocols. These frameworks typically focus on macro-level orchestration while
overlooking agents' internal deliberative capabilities. This critical
meta-cognitive blindspot treats agents as passive executors unable to adapt
their strategy based on internal cognitive states like uncertainty or
confidence. We introduce the Meta-Policy Deliberation Framework (MPDF), where
agents learn a decentralized policy over a set of high-level meta-cognitive
actions: Persist, Refine, and Concede. To overcome the instability of
traditional policy gradients in this setting, we develop SoftRankPO, a novel
reinforcement learning algorithm. SoftRankPO stabilizes training by shaping
advantages based on the rank of rewards mapped through smooth normal quantiles,
making the learning process robust to reward variance. Experiments show that
MPDF with SoftRankPO achieves a a 4-5% absolute gain in average accuracy across
five mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks compared to six
state-of-the-art heuristic and learning-based multi-agent reasoning algorithms.
Our work presents a paradigm for learning adaptive, meta-cognitive policies for
multi-agent LLM systems, shifting the focus from designing fixed protocols to
learning dynamic, deliberative strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted in high-stakes
domains. Their capacity to process vast amounts of unstructured data, explore
flexible scenarios, and handle a diversity of contextual factors can make them
uniquely suited to provide new insights for the complexity of social
policymaking. This article evaluates whether LLMs' are aligned with domain
experts (and among themselves) to inform social policymaking on the subject of
homelessness alleviation - a challenge affecting over 150 million people
worldwide. We develop a novel benchmark comprised of decision scenarios with
policy choices across four geographies (South Bend, USA; Barcelona, Spain;
Johannesburg, South Africa; Macau SAR, China). The policies in scope are
grounded in the conceptual framework of the Capability Approach for human
development. We also present an automated pipeline that connects the
benchmarked policies to an agent-based model, and we explore the social impact
of the recommended policies through simulated social scenarios. The paper
results reveal promising potential to leverage LLMs for social policy making.
If responsible guardrails and contextual calibrations are introduced in
collaboration with local domain experts, LLMs can provide humans with valuable
insights, in the form of alternative policies at scale.

TL;DR: 基于Model Context Protocol的无需训练、防幽灵的OMOP CDM医学术语映射系统，通过外部资源查询提高映射效率和准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OMOP CDM数据标准化过程中，源医学术语向标准概念的映射工作资源浪费且容易出错，而大语言模型存在幽灵问题不适合直接临床部署

Method: 基于Model Context Protocol(MCP)标准化框架，允许LLM与外部资源和工具交互，实现零训练、可解释的映射系统

Result: 系统能够提供实时词汇查询和结构化推理输出，显著提高了映射效率和准确性，适用于探索性和生产环境

Conclusion: 该方法为OMOP CDM数据标准化提供了一种高效、准确且可靠的自动化映射解决方案，免去了训练需求和专家验证的费用

Abstract: The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM)
provides a standardized representation of heterogeneous health data to support
large-scale, multi-institutional research. One critical step in data
standardization using OMOP CDM is the mapping of source medical terms to OMOP
standard concepts, a procedure that is resource-intensive and error-prone.
While large language models (LLMs) have the potential to facilitate this
process, their tendency toward hallucination makes them unsuitable for clinical
deployment without training and expert validation. Here, we developed a
zero-training, hallucination-preventive mapping system based on the Model
Context Protocol (MCP), a standardized and secure framework allowing LLMs to
interact with external resources and tools. The system enables explainable
mapping and significantly improves efficiency and accuracy with minimal effort.
It provides real-time vocabulary lookups and structured reasoning outputs
suitable for immediate use in both exploratory and production environments.

Abstract: Historic urban quarters play a vital role in preserving cultural heritage
while serving as vibrant spaces for tourism and everyday life. Understanding
how tourists perceive these environments is essential for sustainable,
human-centered urban planning. This study proposes a multidimensional
AI-powered framework for analyzing tourist perception in historic urban
quarters using multimodal data from social media. Applied to twelve historic
quarters in central Shanghai, the framework integrates focal point extraction,
color theme analysis, and sentiment mining. Visual focus areas are identified
from tourist-shared photos using a fine-tuned semantic segmentation model. To
assess aesthetic preferences, dominant colors are extracted using a clustering
method, and their spatial distribution across quarters is analyzed. Color
themes are further compared between social media photos and real-world street
views, revealing notable shifts. This divergence highlights potential gaps
between visual expectations and the built environment, reflecting both
stylistic preferences and perceptual bias. Tourist reviews are evaluated
through a hybrid sentiment analysis approach combining a rule-based method and
a multi-task BERT model. Satisfaction is assessed across four dimensions:
tourist activities, built environment, service facilities, and business
formats. The results reveal spatial variations in aesthetic appeal and
emotional response. Rather than focusing on a single technical innovation, this
framework offers an integrated, data-driven approach to decoding tourist
perception and contributes to informed decision-making in tourism, heritage
conservation, and the design of aesthetically engaging public spaces.

Method: 构建两个并行知识图谱：确定性KG（基于规则方法、预定义本体、领域词典）和LLM生成KG（从实时文本数据流动态生成），使用KG结构指标（ICR、IPR、CI）量化偏差，建立动态异常阈值进行实时监控

Result: 通过结构化、指标驱动的比较方法，提供了一个鲁棒且可扩展的评估框架，能够主动识别和标记显著偏差

Conclusion: 该方法能够及时检测语义异常或幻觉，解决了生成式AI可靠性评估的可扩展性和透明度问题

Abstract: Generative AI (GEN AI) models have revolutionized diverse application domains
but present substantial challenges due to reliability concerns, including
hallucinations, semantic drift, and inherent biases. These models typically
operate as black-boxes, complicating transparent and objective evaluation.
Current evaluation methods primarily depend on subjective human assessment,
limiting scalability, transparency, and effectiveness. This research proposes a
systematic methodology using deterministic and Large Language Model
(LLM)-generated Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to continuously monitor and evaluate GEN
AI reliability. We construct two parallel KGs: (i) a deterministic KG built
using explicit rule-based methods, predefined ontologies, domain-specific
dictionaries, and structured entity-relation extraction rules, and (ii) an
LLM-generated KG dynamically derived from real-time textual data streams such
as live news articles. Utilizing real-time news streams ensures authenticity,
mitigates biases from repetitive training, and prevents adaptive LLMs from
bypassing predefined benchmarks through feedback memorization. To quantify
structural deviations and semantic discrepancies, we employ several established
KG metrics, including Instantiated Class Ratio (ICR), Instantiated Property
Ratio (IPR), and Class Instantiation (CI). An automated real-time monitoring
framework continuously computes deviations between deterministic and
LLM-generated KGs. By establishing dynamic anomaly thresholds based on
historical structural metric distributions, our method proactively identifies
and flags significant deviations, thus promptly detecting semantic anomalies or
hallucinations. This structured, metric-driven comparison between deterministic
and dynamically generated KGs delivers a robust and scalable evaluation
framework.

Motivation: 传统新颖性搜索方法在连续细胞自动机的高维行为空间中容易陷入局部最优，无法探索远处未开发区域

Method: E&E策略交替进行局部新颖性扩展和目标导向远征，利用视觉语言模型生成语义目标描述来驱动探索

Result: 在Flow Lenia连续细胞自动机上，E&E比现有方法发现更多样化解决方案，远征产生的解决方案对长期探索影响更大

Conclusion: E&E能够突破局部新颖性边界，以人类可理解的方式探索行为空间，为人工生命等领域的开放式探索提供了有前景的模板

Abstract: Discovering diverse visual patterns in continuous cellular automata (CA) is
challenging due to the vastness and redundancy of high-dimensional behavioral
spaces. Traditional exploration methods like Novelty Search (NS) expand locally
by mutating known novel solutions but often plateau when local novelty is
exhausted, failing to reach distant, unexplored regions. We introduce
Expedition and Expansion (E&E), a hybrid strategy where exploration alternates
between local novelty-driven expansions and goal-directed expeditions. During
expeditions, E&E leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate linguistic
goals--descriptions of interesting but hypothetical patterns that drive
exploration toward uncharted regions. By operating in semantic spaces that
align with human perception, E&E both evaluates novelty and generates goals in
conceptually meaningful ways, enhancing the interpretability and relevance of
discovered behaviors. Tested on Flow Lenia, a continuous CA known for its rich,
emergent behaviors, E&E consistently uncovers more diverse solutions than
existing exploration methods. A genealogical analysis further reveals that
solutions originating from expeditions disproportionately influence long-term
exploration, unlocking new behavioral niches that serve as stepping stones for
subsequent search. These findings highlight E&E's capacity to break through
local novelty boundaries and explore behavioral landscapes in human-aligned,
interpretable ways, offering a promising template for open-ended exploration in
artificial life and beyond.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic AI, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), marks a
paradigm shift from reactive generative systems to proactive, goal-oriented
autonomous agents capable of sophisticated planning, memory, and tool use. This
evolution presents a novel opportunity to address long-standing challenges in
complex digital environments. Core tasks on Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C)
e-commerce platforms often require users to navigate complex Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs), making the experience time-consuming for both buyers and
sellers. This paper introduces a novel approach to simplify these interactions
through an LLM-powered agentic assistant. This agent functions as a new,
conversational entry point to the marketplace, shifting the primary interaction
model from a complex GUI to an intuitive AI agent. By interpreting natural
language commands, the agent automates key high-friction workflows. For
sellers, this includes simplified updating and renewal of listings, and the
ability to send bulk messages. For buyers, the agent facilitates a more
efficient product discovery process through conversational search. We present
the architecture for Facebook Marketplace Assistant (FaMA), arguing that this
agentic, conversational paradigm provides a lightweight and more accessible
alternative to traditional app interfaces, allowing users to manage their
marketplace activities with greater efficiency. Experiments show FaMA achieves
a 98% task success rate on solving complex tasks on the marketplace and enables
up to a 2x speedup on interaction time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医疗基础模型通常以黑盒方式生成答案，缺乏透明的推理过程和局部可解释性，这阻碍了其在临床实践中的部署应用。

Method: 采用顺序训练流程：1)在精选的CXR指令数据上微调获得基础能力；2)通过高质量合成推理样本实现冷启动推理；3)通过在线强化学习优化推理质量和生成性能，使模型能够生成答案并关联图像局部区域的推理步骤。

Result: 在报告生成任务上分别比LLaVA-Rad和MedGemma提升14.54%和31.32%；在视觉问答任务上分别比MedGemma和CheXagent提升57.75%和23.06%；专家评审显示推理步骤的可解释性和临床合理性显著优于Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型(0.7416 vs 0.2584)。

Conclusion: 该工作推动了医疗基础模型向整体性、透明性和临床可操作性方向发展，为CXR解释提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical foundation models (FMs) have shown tremendous promise amid the rapid
advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. However, current
medical FMs typically generate answers in a black-box manner, lacking
transparent reasoning processes and locally grounded interpretability, which
hinders their practical clinical deployments. To this end, we introduce
DeepMedix-R1, a holistic medical FM for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation. It
leverages a sequential training pipeline: initially fine-tuned on curated CXR
instruction data to equip with fundamental CXR interpretation capabilities,
then exposed to high-quality synthetic reasoning samples to enable cold-start
reasoning, and finally refined via online reinforcement learning to enhance
both grounded reasoning quality and generation performance. Thus, the model
produces both an answer and reasoning steps tied to the image's local regions
for each query. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates substantial improvements
in report generation (e.g., 14.54% and 31.32% over LLaVA-Rad and MedGemma) and
visual question answering (e.g., 57.75% and 23.06% over MedGemma and CheXagent)
tasks. To facilitate robust assessment, we propose Report Arena, a benchmarking
framework using advanced language models to evaluate answer quality, further
highlighting the superiority of DeepMedix-R1. Expert review of generated
reasoning steps reveals greater interpretability and clinical plausibility
compared to the established Qwen2.5-VL-7B model (0.7416 vs. 0.2584 overall
preference). Collectively, our work advances medical FM development toward
holistic, transparent, and clinically actionable modeling for CXR
interpretation.

Motivation: 现有方法将控制参数作为嵌入式约束处理，而不是作为搜索空间中的真正决策点，这限制了搜索效率

Method: 开发了基于最佳优先的启发式搜索算法，采用延迟部分扩展策略，在控制参数定义的无限决策空间中进行系统搜索

Result: 算法在涉及控制参数的规划问题上表现出竞争力，并在特定条件下证明了极限完备性

Conclusion: 该方法为处理控制参数提供了一种高效的替代方案，将控制参数作为显式决策点处理优于传统的约束嵌入方法

Abstract: In automated planning, control parameters extend standard action
representations through the introduction of continuous numeric decision
variables. Existing state-of-the-art approaches have primarily handled control
parameters as embedded constraints alongside other temporal and numeric
restrictions, and thus have implicitly treated them as additional constraints
rather than as decision points in the search space. In this paper, we propose
an efficient alternative that explicitly handles control parameters as true
decision points within a systematic search scheme. We develop a best-first,
heuristic search algorithm that operates over infinite decision spaces defined
by control parameters and prove a notion of completeness in the limit under
certain conditions. Our algorithm leverages the concept of delayed partial
expansion, where a state is not fully expanded but instead incrementally
expands a subset of its successors. Our results demonstrate that this novel
search algorithm is a competitive alternative to existing approaches for
solving planning problems involving control parameters.

Result: 在VirtualHome和ALFWorld基准测试中表现出优于多个基于LLM的方法的零样本和少样本性能。

Conclusion: WorMI框架展示了在需要适应性和数据效率的具身智能体场景中可扩展、实际部署的潜力。

Abstract: In embodied AI, a persistent challenge is enabling agents to robustly adapt
to novel domains without requiring extensive data collection or retraining. To
address this, we present a world model implanting framework (WorMI) that
combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with
independently learned, domain-specific world models through test-time
composition. By allowing seamless implantation and removal of the world models,
the embodied agent's policy achieves and maintains cross-domain adaptability.
In the WorMI framework, we employ a prototype-based world model retrieval
approach, utilizing efficient trajectory-based abstract representation
matching, to incorporate relevant models into test-time composition. We also
develop a world-wise compound attention method that not only integrates the
knowledge from the retrieved world models but also aligns their intermediate
representations with the reasoning model's representation within the agent's
policy. This framework design effectively fuses domain-specific knowledge from
multiple world models, ensuring robust adaptation to unseen domains. We
evaluate our WorMI on the VirtualHome and ALFWorld benchmarks, demonstrating
superior zero-shot and few-shot performance compared to several LLM-based
approaches across a range of unseen domains. These results highlight the
frameworks potential for scalable, real-world deployment in embodied agent
scenarios where adaptability and data efficiency are essential.

<details>

Motivation: 解决现有LLM代理在重复失败、低效探索和跨任务适应性有限的问题，同时避免强化学习方案需要大量参数更新和计算资源的问题。

Method: 提出Meta-Policy Reflexion (MPR)框架，将LLM生成的反思整合为结构化的元策略记忆(MPM)，并通过软记忆引导解码和硬规则可接受性检查两种机制在推理时应用。

Result: 在基于AlfWorld的文本代理环境中，相比Reflexion基线，MPR在执行准确性和鲁棒性方面取得一致提升，规则可接受性检查进一步提高了稳定性。

Conclusion: MPR框架能够外部化可重用的纠正知识、强制执行领域约束，同时保持基于语言的反思的适应性，为多模态和多代理扩展提供了未来方向。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents achieve impressive single-task performance
but commonly exhibit repeated failures, inefficient exploration, and limited
cross-task adaptability. Existing reflective strategies (e.g., Reflexion,
ReAct) improve per-episode behavior but typically produce ephemeral,
task-specific traces that are not reused across tasks. Reinforcement-learning
based alternatives can produce transferable policies but require substantial
parameter updates and compute. In this work we introduce Meta-Policy Reflexion
(MPR): a hybrid framework that consolidates LLM-generated reflections into a
structured, predicate-like Meta-Policy Memory (MPM) and applies that memory at
inference time through two complementary mechanisms soft memory-guided decoding
and hard rule admissibility checks(HAC). MPR (i) externalizes reusable
corrective knowledge without model weight updates, (ii) enforces domain
constraints to reduce unsafe or invalid actions, and (iii) retains the
adaptability of language-based reflection. We formalize the MPM representation,
present algorithms for update and decoding, and validate the approach in a
text-based agent environment following the experimental protocol described in
the provided implementation (AlfWorld-based). Empirical results reported in the
supplied material indicate consistent gains in execution accuracy and
robustness when compared to Reflexion baselines; rule admissibility further
improves stability. We analyze mechanisms that explain these gains, discuss
scalability and failure modes, and outline future directions for multimodal and
multi?agent extensions.

Motivation: 伪布尔优化(PBO)局部搜索求解器的设计需要大量专家努力和手动调优，而大语言模型在算法设计自动化方面展现出潜力，但在优化PBO求解器方面的应用尚未探索。

Method: 提出了AutoPBO框架，利用大语言模型来自动增强PBO局部搜索求解器，通过在四个公共基准测试上进行实验验证。

Result: AutoPBO相比之前的局部搜索方法有显著改进，与最先进的竞争对手保持竞争力，包括NuPBO、OraSLS、PBO-IHS、RoundingSat、Gurobi和SCIP等求解器。

Conclusion: AutoPBO为自动化局部搜索求解器设计提供了一种有前景的方法，展示了LLM在算法优化中的潜力。

Abstract: Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (PBO) provides a powerful framework for modeling
combinatorial problems through pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints. Local search
solvers have shown excellent performance in PBO solving, and their efficiency
is highly dependent on their internal heuristics to guide the search. Still,
their design often requires significant expert effort and manual tuning in
practice. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in
automating algorithm design, their application to optimizing PBO solvers
remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce AutoPBO, a novel LLM-powered
framework to automatically enhance PBO local search solvers. We conduct
experiments on a broad range of four public benchmarks, including one
real-world benchmark, a benchmark from PB competition, an integer linear
programming optimization benchmark, and a crafted combinatorial benchmark, to
evaluate the performance improvement achieved by AutoPBO and compare it with
six state-of-the-art competitors, including two local search PBO solvers NuPBO
and OraSLS, two complete PB solvers PBO-IHS and RoundingSat, and two mixed
integer programming (MIP) solvers Gurobi and SCIP. AutoPBO demonstrates
significant improvements over previous local search approaches, while
maintaining competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art competitors.
The results suggest that AutoPBO offers a promising approach to automating
local search solver design.

Motivation: 传统token级RL框架无法与多步推理过程（如Chain-of-Thought）的推理级性质对齐，存在显著的理论空白。

Method: 引入CoT-Space框架，从噪声视角和风险视角分析推理过程，证明最优CoT长度的收敛是欠拟合和过拟合之间基本权衡的自然结果。

Result: 大量实验为理论发现提供了强有力的实证验证，框架能够合理解释过度思考等经验现象。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅为经验现象提供了一致解释，还为未来开发更有效和可泛化的推理智能体奠定了坚实的理论基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a pivotal approach for enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a significant
theoretical gap persists, as traditional token-level RL frameworks fail to
align with the reasoning-level nature of complex, multi-step thought processes
like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). To address this challenge, we introduce CoT-Space,
a novel theoretical framework that recasts LLM reasoning from a discrete
token-prediction task to an optimization process within a continuous,
reasoning-level semantic space. By analyzing this process from both a noise
perspective and a risk perspective, we demonstrate that the convergence to an
optimal CoT length is a natural consequence of the fundamental trade-off
between underfitting and overfitting. Furthermore, extensive experiments
provide strong empirical validation for our theoretical findings. Our framework
not only provides a coherent explanation for empirical phenomena such as
overthinking but also offers a solid theoretical foundation to guide the future
development of more effective and generalizable reasoning agents.

implementation of various aspects of RST. Oruga consists of a core of data
structures corresponding to concepts in RST, a language for communicating with
the core, and an engine for producing transformations using a method we call

structure transfer can execute.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在形式推理能力方面仍然落后，神经符号LLM推理方法使用LLM作为自然语言到形式语言的翻译器，但该方法成功的关键因素尚不清楚。

Method: 通过比较四种形式语言在三个数据集和七个LLM上的表现，分析形式语言选择对神经符号推理能力的影响。

Result: 研究发现形式语言的选择显著影响LLM的语法和语义推理能力，且不同LLM受到的影响程度不同。

Conclusion: 形式语言的选择是神经符号LLM推理成功的关键因素之一，需要根据具体任务和LLM特性选择合适的中间形式语言。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve astonishing results on a wide range of
tasks. However, their formal reasoning ability still lags behind. A promising
approach is Neurosymbolic LLM reasoning. It works by using LLMs as translators
from natural to formal languages and symbolic solvers for deriving correct
results. Still, the contributing factors to the success of Neurosymbolic LLM
reasoning remain unclear. This paper demonstrates that one previously
overlooked factor is the choice of the formal language. We introduce the
intermediate language challenge: selecting a suitable formal language for
neurosymbolic reasoning. By comparing four formal languages across three
datasets and seven LLMs, we show that the choice of formal language affects
both syntactic and semantic reasoning capabilities. We also discuss the varying
effects across different LLMs.

Conclusion: 该方法能显著加速航线优化计算，在几乎不牺牲燃油效率的前提下实现快速路径重规划，适用于航空紧急情况

Abstract: This paper explores the combination of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and
search-based path planners to speed up the optimization of flight paths for
airliners, where in case of emergency a fast route re-calculation can be
crucial. The fundamental idea is to train an RL Agent to pre-compute
near-optimal paths based on location and atmospheric data and use those at
runtime to constrain the underlying path planning solver and find a solution
within a certain distance from the initial guess. The approach effectively
reduces the size of the solver's search space, significantly speeding up route
optimization. Although global optimality is not guaranteed, empirical results
conducted with Airbus aircraft's performance models show that fuel consumption
remains nearly identical to that of an unconstrained solver, with deviations
typically within 1%. At the same time, computation speed can be improved by up
to 50% as compared to using a conventional solver alone.

*Tarik Zaciragic,Aske Plaat,K. Joost Batenburg*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究DQN和CFR算法在Leduc Hold'em扑克中是否表现出诈唬行为，发现两者都诈唬但方式不同，成功率相近，表明诈唬是游戏本质而非算法特性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扑克游戏中诈唬是重要技能，但现有计算机扑克研究多关注胜率等指标，忽略了诈唬行为的研究

Method: 设计实验让基于强化学习的DQN和基于博弈论的CFR算法在Leduc Hold'em中对战，记录并分析它们的行动

Result: DQN和CFR都表现出诈唬行为，但诈唬频率不同；两者的成功诈唬率（对手弃牌）大致相同

Conclusion: 诈唬是扑克游戏的本质特征，而非特定算法的特性；未来应研究不同诈唬风格和完整扑克游戏

Abstract: In the game of poker, being unpredictable, or bluffing, is an essential
skill. When humans play poker, they bluff. However, most works on
computer-poker focus on performance metrics such as win rates, while bluffing
is overlooked. In this paper we study whether two popular algorithms, DQN
(based on reinforcement learning) and CFR (based on game theory), exhibit
bluffing behavior in Leduc Hold'em, a simplified version of poker. We designed
an experiment where we let the DQN and CFR agent play against each other while
we log their actions. We find that both DQN and CFR exhibit bluffing behavior,
but they do so in different ways. Although both attempt to perform bluffs at
different rates, the percentage of successful bluffs (where the opponent folds)
is roughly the same. This suggests that bluffing is an essential aspect of the
game, not of the algorithm. Future work should look at different bluffing
styles and at the full game of poker. Code at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文认为AI虽然可能在能力上超越人类，但缺乏中枢神经系统带来的情感体验和道德理解，因此无法真正成为宇宙的领导者


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI与人类在宇宙领导权方面的本质差异，挑战AI将全面超越人类的观点

Method: 通过哲学和生物学分析，比较人类中枢神经系统与AI系统的根本区别

Result: 发现情感体验和道德理解是人类独有的特质，AI无法通过模拟获得真正的伦理判断能力

Conclusion: DNA而非硅基技术才是宇宙领导权的最佳基础，人类的中枢神经系统提供了AI无法复制的道德优势

Abstract: Recent advances in AI raise the possibility that AI systems will one day be
able to do anything humans can do, only better. If artificial general
intelligence (AGI) is achieved, AI systems may be able to understand, reason,
problem solve, create, and evolve at a level and speed that humans will
increasingly be unable to match, or even understand. These possibilities raise
a natural question as to whether AI will eventually become superior to humans,
a successor "digital species", with a rightful claim to assume leadership of
the universe. However, a deeper consideration suggests the overlooked
differentiator between human beings and AI is not the brain, but the central
nervous system (CNS), providing us with an immersive integration with physical
reality. It is our CNS that enables us to experience emotion including pain,
joy, suffering, and love, and therefore to fully appreciate the consequences of
our actions on the world around us. And that emotional understanding of the
consequences of our actions is what is required to be able to develop
sustainable ethical systems, and so be fully qualified to be the leaders of the
universe. A CNS cannot be manufactured or simulated; it must be grown as a
biological construct. And so, even the development of consciousness will not be
sufficient to make AI systems superior to humans. AI systems may become more
capable than humans on almost every measure and transform our society. However,
the best foundation for leadership of our universe will always be DNA, not
silicon.

Abstract: Formalizing cooking procedures remains a challenging task due to their
inherent complexity and ambiguity. We introduce an extensible domain-specific
language for representing recipes as directed action graphs, capturing
processes, transfers, environments, concurrency, and compositional structure.
Our approach enables precise, modular modeling of complex culinary workflows.
Initial manual evaluation on a full English breakfast recipe demonstrates the
DSL's expressiveness and suitability for future automated recipe analysis and

ontology for cooking, using temporal graphs to enable structured machine
understanding, precise interpretation, and scalable automation of culinary
processes - both in home kitchens and professional culinary settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文研究马尔可夫逻辑网络(MLN)在域大小趋于无穷时的分布特性，分析了三种具体MLN示例的极限行为，并证明了量化自由MLN与提升贝叶斯网络在渐近意义上的不可比性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究MLN在无限域情况下的分布特性，探索不同软约束对随机结构极限行为的影响，以及比较不同概率图模型在渐近表达能力上的差异。

Method: 通过分析三种具体MLN示例：(1)单一元关系符号的量化自由MLN；(2)偏好较少三角形/团结构的MLN；(3)偏好较少高度数顶点的MLN，研究其在大域情况下的极限分布特性。

Result: 发现不同软约束会导致完全不同的极限行为，权重参数可能影响也可能不影响极限分布；证明了量化自由MLN与提升贝叶斯网络在渐近意义上不可比；显示MLN在大域上几乎将所有概率质量集中在与均匀分布完全不同的可能世界子集上。

Conclusion: MLN的极限行为高度依赖于所使用的软约束类型，不同形式的MLN具有不同的渐近表达能力，这为理解概率图模型在大规模域上的理论性质提供了重要见解。

Abstract: A Markov logic network (MLN) determines a probability distribution on the set
of structures, or ``possible worlds'', with an arbitrary finite domain. We
study the properties of such distributions as the domain size tends to
infinity. Three types of concrete examples of MLNs will be considered, and the
properties of random structures with domain sizes tending to infinity will be
studied: (1) Arbitrary quantifier-free MLNs over a language with only one
relation symbol which has arity 1. In this case we give a pretty complete
characterization of the possible limit behaviours of random structures. (2) An
MLN that favours graphs with fewer triangles (or more generally, fewer
k-cliques). As a corollary of the analysis a ``$\delta$-approximate 0-1 law''
for first-order logic is obtained. (3) An MLN that favours graphs with fewer
vertices with degree higher than a fixed (but arbitrary) number. The analysis
shows that depending on which ``soft constraints'' an MLN uses the limit
behaviour of random structures can be quite different, and the weights of the
soft constraints may, or may not, have influence on the limit behaviour. It
will also be demonstrated, using (1), that quantifier-free MLNs and lifted
Bayesian networks (in a broad sense) are asymptotically incomparable, roughly
meaning that there is a sequence of distributions on possible worlds with
increasing domain sizes that can be defined by one of the formalisms but not
even approximated by the other. In a rather general context it is also shown
that on large domains the distribution determined by an MLN concentrates almost
all its probability mass on a totally different part of the space of possible
worlds than the uniform distribution does.

TL;DR: EvoEmo是一个进化强化学习框架，通过优化动态情绪表达来提升LLM在复杂多轮谈判中的表现，相比传统策略获得更高成功率和效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理在谈判中忽视了情绪的功能性作用，仅生成被动、偏好驱动的情绪响应，使其容易受到对手操纵和战略利用

Method: 将情绪状态转换建模为马尔可夫决策过程，采用基于种群的遗传优化来演化高奖励情绪策略，并提出包含普通策略和固定情绪策略的评估基准

Result: EvoEmo在两个基准测试中均表现优异，实现了更高的成功率、效率和买家节省，突显了适应性情绪表达的重要性

Conclusion: 自适应情绪表达对于构建更有效的多轮谈判LLM代理至关重要，EvoEmo框架为此提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Recent research on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in Large Language Models
(LLMs) has demonstrated that agents can engage in \textit{complex},
\textit{multi-turn} negotiations, opening new avenues for agentic AI. However,
existing LLM agents largely overlook the functional role of emotions in such
negotiations, instead generating passive, preference-driven emotional responses
that make them vulnerable to manipulation and strategic exploitation by
adversarial counterparts. To address this gap, we present EvoEmo, an
evolutionary reinforcement learning framework that optimizes dynamic emotional
expression in negotiations. EvoEmo models emotional state transitions as a
Markov Decision Process and employs population-based genetic optimization to
evolve high-reward emotion policies across diverse negotiation scenarios. We
further propose an evaluation framework with two baselines -- vanilla
strategies and fixed-emotion strategies -- for benchmarking emotion-aware
negotiation. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that EvoEmo
consistently outperforms both baselines, achieving higher success rates, higher
efficiency, and increased buyer savings. This findings highlight the importance
of adaptive emotional expression in enabling more effective LLM agents for
multi-turn negotiation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文分析了AlphaZero在测试环境可能变化时的部署问题，通过简单修改标准框架显著提升性能，特别是在低规划预算场景下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AlphaZero框架通常假设训练和测试环境相同，这限制了其实际应用。当测试环境发生变化时，标准AlphaZero的性能会下降，需要改进以适应环境变化。

Method: 对标准AlphaZero框架进行简单修改，结合蒙特卡洛规划和预训练策略-价值神经网络，优化在变化环境中的部署性能。

Result: 实验证明，即使在使用低规划预算的情况下，所提出的修改方法也能显著提升AlphaZero在变化测试环境中的性能表现。

Conclusion: 通过简单的框架修改，AlphaZero可以更好地适应测试环境的变化，扩展了其在实际应用中的适用性，代码已在GitHub上公开。

Abstract: The AlphaZero framework provides a standard way of combining Monte Carlo
planning with prior knowledge provided by a previously trained policy-value
neural network. AlphaZero usually assumes that the environment on which the
neural network was trained will not change at test time, which constrains its
applicability. In this paper, we analyze the problem of deploying AlphaZero
agents in potentially changed test environments and demonstrate how the
combination of simple modifications to the standard framework can significantly
boost performance, even in settings with a low planning budget available. The
code is publicly available on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将心理学人格理论融入LLM智能体设计，通过人格条件化提升智能体在不同任务中的行为一致性和可解释性

Method: 基于MBTI人格理论的提示工程方法，通过人格原型提示来条件化LLM行为，并整合16Personalities测试进行自动化人格特质验证

Result: 人格条件化在不同任务中产生一致的行为偏差：情感表达型智能体在叙事生成中表现优异，分析型智能体在博弈论场景中采用更稳定策略，自我反思能改善合作和推理质量

Conclusion: 该框架为心理学增强的AI智能体奠定了基础，无需微调即可实现人格一致的行为控制，且方法可推广到其他心理学框架如大五人格、HEXACO等

Abstract: We introduce MBTI-in-Thoughts, a framework for enhancing the effectiveness of
Large Language Model (LLM) agents through psychologically grounded personality
conditioning. Drawing on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), our method
primes agents with distinct personality archetypes via prompt engineering,
enabling control over behavior along two foundational axes of human psychology,
cognition and affect. We show that such personality priming yields consistent,
interpretable behavioral biases across diverse tasks: emotionally expressive
agents excel in narrative generation, while analytically primed agents adopt
more stable strategies in game-theoretic settings. Our framework supports
experimenting with structured multi-agent communication protocols and reveals
that self-reflection prior to interaction improves cooperation and reasoning
quality. To ensure trait persistence, we integrate the official 16Personalities
test for automated verification. While our focus is on MBTI, we show that our
approach generalizes seamlessly to other psychological frameworks such as Big
Five, HEXACO, or Enneagram. By bridging psychological theory and LLM behavior
design, we establish a foundation for psychologically enhanced AI agents
without any fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理时扩展技术产生的模式和见解在上下文重置后立即丢弃，需要更广泛可重用和可扩展的外部记忆系统

Method: 从解决方案轨迹中提取可重用、模块化的自然语言抽象概念，选择性检索并整合到提示中，引入新的抽象和检索策略

Result: 在ARC-AGI基准上获得7.5%相对提升，性能随推理计算规模持续扩展，抽象概念在所有测试规模上均优于基线

Conclusion: 概念级记忆是最一致的设计，动态更新记忆优于固定记忆设置，支持通过解决更多问题和抽象更多模式实现自我改进的假设

Abstract: While inference-time scaling enables LLMs to carry out increasingly long and
capable reasoning traces, the patterns and insights uncovered during these
traces are immediately discarded once the context window is reset for a new
query. External memory is a natural way to persist these discoveries, and
recent work has shown clear benefits for reasoning-intensive tasks. We see an
opportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving
beyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or
summaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward
concept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution
traces and stored in natural language. For future queries, relevant concepts
are selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time
continual learning without weight updates. Our design introduces new strategies
for abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries,
promoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences. On
the challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, our method yields a 7.5% relative gain over
a strong no-memory baseline with performance continuing to scale with inference
compute. We find abstract concepts to be the most consistent memory design,
outscoring the baseline at all tested inference compute scales. Moreover, we
confirm that dynamically updating memory during test-time outperforms an
otherwise identical fixed memory setting with additional attempts, supporting
the hypothesis that solving more problems and abstracting more patterns to
memory enables further solutions in a form of self-improvement. Code available

TL;DR: 提出基于黎曼几何的新型神经网络优化器，利用损失景观在高维空间嵌入时自然诱导的度量，在低维任务中表现优异，在神经网络训练中略优于现有最优方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从几何视角出发，利用损失景观可视化中基础的黎曼度量，开发理论上具有理想性质的新型优化器

Method: 基于损失景观在高维空间嵌入时诱导的黎曼度量开发优化器，可修改任何现有预处理方法，计算复杂度与Adam相当

Result: 在低维示例中高度有效，在神经网络训练中比SGD、Adam、AdamW、Muon等现有方法略有改进

Conclusion: 这类新型优化器具有理论优势：在高曲率区域自动降低有效学习率（类似平滑梯度裁剪），某些变体可视为诱导有效学习率调度，从几何视角自然支持解耦权重衰减

Abstract: We present a class of novel optimisers for training neural networks that
makes use of the Riemannian metric naturally induced when the loss landscape is
embedded in higher-dimensional space. This is the same metric that underlies
common visualisations of loss landscapes. By taking this geometric perspective
literally and using the induced metric, we develop a new optimiser and compare
it to existing methods, namely: SGD, Adam, AdamW, and Muon, across a range of
tasks and architectures. Empirically, we conclude that this new class of
optimisers is highly effective in low dimensional examples, and provides slight
improvement over state-of-the-art methods for training neural networks. These
new optimisers have theoretically desirable properties. In particular, the
effective learning rate is automatically decreased in regions of high curvature
acting as a smoothed out form of gradient clipping. Similarly, one variant of
these optimisers can also be viewed as inducing an effective scheduled learning
rate and decoupled weight decay is the natural choice from our geometric
perspective. The basic method can be used to modify any existing
preconditioning method. The new optimiser has a computational complexity
comparable to that of Adam.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI模型多为单一任务设计，限制了在真实医疗场景中的通用性和实用性，需要开发能够统一处理多种EHR任务的通用模型。

Method: 提出CEHR-GPT模型，采用新颖的时间令牌学习框架，将患者的动态时间线显式编码到模型结构中，支持词汇扩展和微调。

Result: 模型在三个核心任务上均表现出色，能够有效泛化到外部数据集，支持快速模型开发、队列发现和患者预后预测。

Conclusion: CEHR-GPT提供了一个统一的架构，无需任务特定的重新训练即可实现多种EHR分析功能，具有很好的通用性和实用性。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provide a rich, longitudinal view of patient
health and hold significant potential for advancing clinical decision support,
risk prediction, and data-driven healthcare research. However, most artificial
intelligence (AI) models for EHRs are designed for narrow, single-purpose
tasks, limiting their generalizability and utility in real-world settings.
Here, we present CEHR-GPT, a general-purpose foundation model for EHR data that
unifies three essential capabilities - feature representation, zero-shot
prediction, and synthetic data generation - within a single architecture. To
support temporal reasoning over clinical sequences, \cehrgpt{} incorporates a
novel time-token-based learning framework that explicitly encodes patients'
dynamic timelines into the model structure. CEHR-GPT demonstrates strong
performance across all three tasks and generalizes effectively to external
datasets through vocabulary expansion and fine-tuning. Its versatility enables
rapid model development, cohort discovery, and patient outcome forecasting
without the need for task-specific retraining.

Motivation: 提供社区检测的游戏论角度解释，展现CPM模型的高效性、稳健性和准确性，以支持社区追踪任务中的初始分割初始化。

Method: 将CPM全局哈密顿量分解为局部效用函数，通过更好响应动态进行局部优化，并提出两种稳定性标准：严格的稳健性标准和放松的权重加权效用函数。

Result: 理论证明局部优化在假多项式时间内收敛到均衡分割；实验结果显示，在社区追踪任务中，稳健分割能够提高恢复真实社区的准确性。

Conclusion: 游戏论角度为CPM模型提供了理论支撑，其高效性、稳健性和准确性使得它在社区检测和追踪任务中具有强大的应用潜力。

Abstract: Community detection is one of the fundamental problems in data science which
consists of partitioning nodes into disjoint communities. We present a
game-theoretic perspective on the Constant Potts Model (CPM) for partitioning
networks into disjoint communities, emphasizing its efficiency, robustness, and
accuracy. Efficiency: We reinterpret CPM as a potential hedonic game by
decomposing its global Hamiltonian into local utility functions, where the
local utility gain of each agent matches the corresponding increase in global
utility. Leveraging this equivalence, we prove that local optimization of the
CPM objective via better-response dynamics converges in pseudo-polynomial time
to an equilibrium partition. Robustness: We introduce and relate two stability
criteria: a strict criterion based on a novel notion of robustness, requiring
nodes to simultaneously maximize neighbors and minimize non-neighbors within
communities, and a relaxed utility function based on a weighted sum of these
objectives, controlled by a resolution parameter. Accuracy: In community
tracking scenarios, where initial partitions are used to bootstrap the Leiden
algorithm with partial ground-truth information, our experiments reveal that
robust partitions yield higher accuracy in recovering ground-truth communities.

Motivation: 研究NMF和PCC这两个看似不同的概念之间的内在联系，旨在解决NMF的秩估计不稳定性和非可识别性问题，同时为PCC提供近似实现方法

Method: 通过将灰度图像映射到概率模型，利用PCC原理开发稳健的NMF秩估计方法，并基于此实现数据聚类和去噪

Result: 提出的秩估计方法对弱噪声具有稳定性，解决了NMF的非可识别性问题；同时实现了基于共同原因的聚类和有效的数据去噪

Conclusion: NMF和PCC之间存在深刻的双向关系，这种关联为解决秩估计、聚类和去噪等问题提供了新的有效途径

Abstract: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a known unsupervised data-reduction
method. The principle of the common cause (PCC) is a basic methodological
approach in probabilistic causality, which seeks an independent mixture model
for the joint probability of two dependent random variables. It turns out that
these two concepts are closely related. This relationship is explored
reciprocally for several datasets of gray-scale images, which are conveniently
mapped into probability models. On one hand, PCC provides a predictability tool
that leads to a robust estimation of the effective rank of NMF. Unlike other
estimates (e.g., those based on the Bayesian Information Criteria), our
estimate of the rank is stable against weak noise. We show that NMF implemented
around this rank produces features (basis images) that are also stable against
noise and against seeds of local optimization, thereby effectively resolving
the NMF nonidentifiability problem. On the other hand, NMF provides an
interesting possibility of implementing PCC in an approximate way, where larger
and positively correlated joint probabilities tend to be explained better via
the independent mixture model. We work out a clustering method, where data
points with the same common cause are grouped into the same cluster. We also
show how NMF can be employed for data denoising.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了异质智能体奖励函数推断问题，为实际应用中复杂多智能体系统的奖励设计提供了实用框架

Abstract: Designing suitable reward functions for numerous interacting intelligent
agents is challenging in real-world applications. Inverse reinforcement
learning (IRL) in mean field games (MFGs) offers a practical framework to infer
reward functions from expert demonstrations. While promising, the assumption of
agent homogeneity limits the capability of existing methods to handle
demonstrations with heterogeneous and unknown objectives, which are common in
practice. To this end, we propose a deep latent variable MFG model and an
associated IRL method. Critically, our method can infer rewards from different
yet structurally similar tasks without prior knowledge about underlying
contexts or modifying the MFG model itself. Our experiments, conducted on
simulated scenarios and a real-world spatial taxi-ride pricing problem,
demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art IRL methods
in MFGs.

Motivation: 在物联网场景中，联邦学习客户端不仅面临数据异构性问题，还受到有限能量和可用性预算的约束。因此，有效选择参与训练的客户端对于全局模型收敛和客户端贡献平衡至关重要。

Method: 提出了FedDeCAB方法：1）设置三种影响时间序列数据可用性的场景；2）采用概率排名选择可用客户端；3）当客户端与服务器断开连接时，允许从最近邻客户端获取部分模型参数进行联合优化。

Result: 基于真实世界大规模出租车和船舶轨迹数据集的实验表明，FedDeCAB在高度异构数据分布、有限通信预算以及动态客户端离线或重新加入的情况下都表现有效。

Conclusion: FedDeCAB方法能够有效处理联邦学习中客户端可用性问题，特别是在时间序列数据场景下，通过半去中心化的客户端选择和参数共享机制，提升了模型性能并降低了通信成本。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) effectively promotes collaborative training among
distributed clients with privacy considerations in the Internet of Things (IoT)
scenarios. Despite of data heterogeneity, FL clients may also be constrained by
limited energy and availability budgets. Therefore, effective selection of
clients participating in training is of vital importance for the convergence of
the global model and the balance of client contributions. In this paper, we
discuss the performance impact of client availability with time-series data on
federated learning. We set up three different scenarios that affect the
availability of time-series data and propose FedDeCAB, a novel,
semi-decentralized client selection method applying probabilistic rankings of
available clients. When a client is disconnected from the server, FedDeCAB
allows obtaining partial model parameters from the nearest neighbor clients for
joint optimization, improving the performance of offline models and reducing
communication overhead. Experiments based on real-world large-scale taxi and
vessel trajectory datasets show that FedDeCAB is effective under highly
heterogeneous data distribution, limited communication budget, and dynamic
client offline or rejoining.

learning and time-series forecasting models, we optimize microgrid energy
dispatch strategies to minimize costs and maximize the utilization of renewable
energy sources such as solar and wind. Our approach integrates the transformer
architecture for forecasting of renewable generation and a proximal-policy
optimization (PPO) agent to make decisions in a simulated environment. Our
experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in both energy
efficiency and operational resilience when compared to traditional rule-based
methods. This work contributes to advancing smart-grid technologies in pursuit
of zero-carbon energy systems. We finally provide an open-source framework for

*Arpan Mukherjee,Marcello Bullo,Deniz Gündüz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SharedRep-RLHF是一个新的RLHF框架，通过学习群体间的共享特征而不是单独学习群体特定的奖励模型，解决了MaxMin-RLHF在少数群体表现不佳的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MaxMin-RLHF方法虽然通过群体特定奖励模型和最小奖励优化来促进公平性，但在最小奖励群体是少数群体时表现不佳，无法有效捕捉群体间的共享特征。

Method: SharedRep-RLHF通过学习不同群体标注中的共享特征，而不是为每个群体学习单独的奖励模型。该方法首先证明了MaxMin-RLHF在学习共享特征方面的次优性，然后量化了SharedRep-RLHF的样本复杂度。

Result: 在多种自然语言任务上的实验显示，SharedRep-RLHF相比MaxMin-RLHF在胜率上提升了高达20%。

Conclusion: SharedRep-RLHF通过有效学习群体间的共享特征，显著改善了在少数群体上的性能表现，为多群体偏好学习提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Uniform-reward reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which
trains a single reward model to represent the preferences of all annotators,
fails to capture the diversity of opinions across sub-populations,
inadvertently favoring dominant groups. The state-of-the-art, MaxMin-RLHF,
addresses this by learning group-specific reward models, and by optimizing for
the group receiving the minimum reward, thereby promoting fairness. However, we
identify that a key limitation of MaxMin-RLHF is its poor performance when the
minimum-reward group is a minority. To mitigate this drawback, we introduce a
novel framework, termed {\em SharedRep-RLHF}. At its core, SharedRep-RLHF
learns and leverages {\em shared traits} in annotations among various groups,
in contrast to learning separate reward models across groups. We first show
that MaxMin-RLHF is provably suboptimal in learning shared traits, and then
quantify the sample complexity of SharedRep-RLHF. Experiments across diverse
natural language tasks showcase the effectiveness of SharedRep-RLHF compared to
MaxMin-RLHF with a gain of up to 20% in win rate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决供应链管理中的效率损失、融资约束和风险传播问题，提升供应链整体运作效能。

Method: 结合交易成本和信息不对称理论，使用随机森林处理多维数据，构建数据驱动的三维分析框架（成本-效率-风险）。采用LSTM网络进行需求预测，聚类/回归算法进行利益分配，结合对冲理论和强化学习优化库存-采购机制，使用XGBoost进行信用评估。

Conclusion: 该SCM-FSCM模型能够有效降低运营成本、缓解融资约束、支持高质量供应链发展，为供应链管理提供了数据驱动的综合解决方案。

Abstract: Based on economic theories and integrated with machine learning technology,
this study explores a collaborative Supply Chain Management and Financial
Supply Chain Management (SCM - FSCM) model to solve issues like efficiency
loss, financing constraints, and risk transmission. We combine Transaction Cost
and Information Asymmetry theories and use algorithms such as random forests to
process multi-dimensional data and build a data-driven, three-dimensional
(cost-efficiency-risk) analysis framework. We then apply an FSCM model of "core
enterprise credit empowerment plus dynamic pledge financing." We use Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for demand forecasting and
clustering/regression algorithms for benefit allocation. The study also
combines Game Theory and reinforcement learning to optimize the
inventory-procurement mechanism and uses eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
for credit assessment to enable rapid monetization of inventory. Verified with
20 core and 100 supporting enterprises, the results show a 30\% increase in
inventory turnover, an 18\%-22\% decrease in SME financing costs, a stable
order fulfillment rate above 95\%, and excellent model performance (demand
forecasting error <= 8\%, credit assessment accuracy >= 90\%). This SCM-FSCM
model effectively reduces operating costs, alleviates financing constraints,
and supports high-quality supply chain development.

Conclusion: 该研究突出了直接跟踪梯度动态的重要性，有助于缩小理论与实践间的差距，为未来优化算法研究提供了见解。

Abstract: Gradient dynamics play a central role in determining the stability and
generalization of deep neural networks. In this work, we provide an empirical
analysis of how variance and standard deviation of gradients evolve during
training, showing consistent changes across layers and at the global scale in
convolutional networks. Motivated by these observations, we propose a
hyperparameter-free gradient normalization method that aligns gradient scaling
with their natural evolution. This approach prevents unintended amplification,
stabilizes optimization, and preserves convergence guarantees. Experiments on
the challenging CIFAR-100 benchmark with ResNet-20, ResNet-56, and VGG-16-BN
demonstrate that our method maintains or improves test accuracy even under
strong generalization. Beyond practical performance, our study highlights the
importance of directly tracking gradient dynamics, aiming to bridge the gap
between theoretical expectations and empirical behaviors, and to provide
insights for future optimization research.

Conclusion: HF-FMs为解决边缘网络中多模态多任务基础模型的异质性问题提供了有效框架，展示了其在无线网络环境中的潜力，并为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: The rise of foundation models (FMs) has reshaped the landscape of machine
learning. As these models continued to grow, leveraging geo-distributed data
from wireless devices has become increasingly critical, giving rise to
federated foundation models (FFMs). More recently, FMs have evolved into
multi-modal multi-task (M3T) FMs (e.g., GPT-4) capable of processing diverse
modalities across multiple tasks, which motivates a new underexplored paradigm:
M3T FFMs. In this paper, we unveil an unexplored variation of M3T FFMs by
proposing hierarchical federated foundation models (HF-FMs), which in turn
expose two overlooked heterogeneity dimensions to fog/edge networks that have a
direct impact on these emerging models: (i) heterogeneity in collected
modalities and (ii) heterogeneity in executed tasks across fog/edge nodes.
HF-FMs strategically align the modular structure of M3T FMs, comprising
modality encoders, prompts, mixture-of-experts (MoEs), adapters, and task
heads, with the hierarchical nature of fog/edge infrastructures. Moreover,
HF-FMs enable the optional usage of device-to-device (D2D) communications,
enabling horizontal module relaying and localized cooperative training among
nodes when feasible. Through delving into the architectural design of HF-FMs,
we highlight their unique capabilities along with a series of tailored future
research directions. Finally, to demonstrate their potential, we prototype
HF-FMs in a wireless network setting and release the open-source code for the
development of HF-FMs with the goal of fostering exploration in this untapped
field (GitHub: https://github.com/payamsiabd/M3T-FFM).

*Tristan Luca Saidi,Abigail Hickok,Bastian Rieck,Andrew J. Blumberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EmbedOR是一种新的随机邻居嵌入算法，通过引入离散图曲率来改进UMAP和tSNE在噪声高维数据可视化中的几何保持能力，避免虚假分离连接组件并更好地发现聚类结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SNE算法（如UMAP和tSNE）在处理噪声高维数据时无法很好地保持数据几何结构，经常错误地分离连接的数据子流形组件，且在良好可聚类数据中无法有效发现聚类。

Method: 提出EmbedOR算法，引入离散图曲率增强的距离度量，通过曲率强调底层聚类结构，进行随机嵌入。证明了该距离度量将tSNE的一致性结果扩展到更广泛的数据集类别。

Result: 在合成和真实数据上的大量实验表明，EmbedOR相比其他SNE算法和UMAP，能更好地保持数据几何结构，更不容易分割连续高密度区域，且可用作注释现有可视化以识别分割问题的工具。

Conclusion: EmbedOR通过曲率增强的距离度量有效解决了现有SNE算法的局限性，在保持数据几何结构和可视化质量方面表现出色，为高维数据可视化提供了新的有效工具。

Abstract: Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE) algorithms like UMAP and tSNE often
produce visualizations that do not preserve the geometry of noisy and high
dimensional data. In particular, they can spuriously separate connected
components of the underlying data submanifold and can fail to find clusters in
well-clusterable data. To address these limitations, we propose EmbedOR, a SNE
algorithm that incorporates discrete graph curvature. Our algorithm
stochastically embeds the data using a curvature-enhanced distance metric that
emphasizes underlying cluster structure. Critically, we prove that the EmbedOR
distance metric extends consistency results for tSNE to a much broader class of
datasets. We also describe extensive experiments on synthetic and real data
that demonstrate the visualization and geometry-preservation capabilities of
EmbedOR. We find that, unlike other SNE algorithms and UMAP, EmbedOR is much
less likely to fragment continuous, high-density regions of the data. Finally,
we demonstrate that the EmbedOR distance metric can be used as a tool to
annotate existing visualizations to identify fragmentation and provide deeper
insight into the underlying geometry of the data.

TL;DR: Delta Activations是一种通过测量微调模型相对于基础模型内部激活变化来表示微调模型的方法，能够将模型表示为向量嵌入，实现有效的领域和任务聚类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源大语言模型的成功使得社区创建了大量针对特定任务和领域的微调模型，但由于元数据不一致和存储库非结构化，导航和理解这些模型仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 通过测量微调模型相对于基础模型的内部激活偏移，将微调模型表示为向量嵌入，这种方法能够对模型进行有效的领域和任务聚类。

Result: Delta Activations表现出良好的特性：在不同微调设置下具有鲁棒性，当微调数据集混合时表现出可加性。该方法还可以通过少样本微调嵌入任务，并可用于模型选择和合并。

Conclusion: Delta Activations方法有助于促进公开可用模型的重用实践，为模型导航和理解提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The success of powerful open source Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled
the community to create a vast collection of post-trained models adapted to
specific tasks and domains. However, navigating and understanding these models
remains challenging due to inconsistent metadata and unstructured repositories.
We introduce Delta Activations, a method to represent finetuned models as
vector embeddings by measuring shifts in their internal activations relative to
a base model. This representation allows for effective clustering by domain and
task, revealing structure in the model landscape. Delta Activations also
demonstrate desirable properties: it is robust across finetuning settings and
exhibits an additive property when finetuning datasets are mixed. In addition,
we show that Delta Activations can embed tasks via few-shot finetuning, and
further explore its use for model selection and merging. We hope Delta
Activations can facilitate the practice of reusing publicly available models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实际测试场景中，对每个受试者进行所有候选测试成本高昂且不必要，特别是当测试相关时。需要开发在线学习算法来选择最优测试子集，但测试结果的联合分布未知且存在缺失数据导致的估计偏差，这使得问题比标准情景MDP更加困难。

Method: 将问题建模为马尔可夫决策过程(MDP)，但由于分布未知需要在线学习。证明了最小最大遗憾下界为Ω(T^{2/3})，提出了Explore-Then-Commit算法匹配该下界。还研究了奖励与缺失数据无关的变体问题，设计了迭代消除算法实现Õ(√T)遗憾。

Result: 理论分析显示OTP问题的最小最大遗憾下界为Ω(T^{2/3})，高于标准情景MDP的Θ(√T)。提出的算法在离散和高斯分布下都能达到Õ(T^{2/3})累积遗憾。对于奖励与缺失数据无关的变体问题，实现了Õ(√T)的更好遗憾界。数值实验验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了缺失数据对探索-利用权衡的深刻影响，证明了OTP问题的固有难度高于标准MDP。通过分析不同问题结构（奖励是否依赖缺失数据）对遗憾界的影响，为设计高效的序列测试策略提供了理论指导和算法框架。

Abstract: This paper studies an online learning problem that seeks optimal testing
policies for a stream of subjects, each of whom can be evaluated through a
sequence of candidate tests drawn from a common pool. We refer to this problem
as the Online Testing Problem (OTP). Although conducting every candidate test
for a subject provides more information, it is often preferable to select only
a subset when tests are correlated and costly, and make decisions with partial
information. If the joint distribution of test outcomes were known, the problem
could be cast as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solved exactly. In
practice, this distribution is unknown and must be learned online as subjects
are tested. When a subject is not fully tested, the resulting missing data can
bias estimates, making the problem fundamentally harder than standard episodic
MDPs. We prove that the minimax regret must scale at least as
$\Omega(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$, in contrast to the $\Theta(\sqrt{T})$ rate in
episodic MDPs, revealing the difficulty introduced by missingness. This
elevated lower bound is then matched by an Explore-Then-Commit algorithm whose
cumulative regret is $\tilde{O}(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ for both discrete and
Gaussian distributions. To highlight the consequence of missingness-dependent
rewards in OTP, we study a variant called the Online Cost-sensitive Maximum
Entropy Sampling Problem, where rewards are independent of missing data. This
structure enables an iterative-elimination algorithm that achieves
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret, breaking the $\Omega(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ lower
bound for OTP. Numerical results confirm our theory in both settings. Overall,
this work deepens the understanding of the exploration--exploitation trade-off
under missing data and guides the design of efficient sequential testing
policies.

TL;DR: 提出了可微分的范围分区熵估计器，使该计算几何概念能够用于深度学习，通过熵正则化提升算法效率和结构化表示


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 范围分区熵在算法设计中提供强大保证，但尚未应用于深度学习，需要使其可微分以便作为可训练损失或正则化器使用

Method: 提出首个可微分范围分区熵近似估计器，设计EntropyNet神经模块重构数据为低熵形式以加速下游算法，并将熵正则化扩展到Transformer注意力机制

Result: 在几何任务中实现4.1倍运行速度提升且误差小于0.2%；在深度学习中实现80%稀疏度下准确率比L1基线高6%

Conclusion: 熵有界计算不仅是理论优雅的，也是实现自适应学习、效率和结构化表示的实用机制

Abstract: We introduce a differentiable estimator of range-partition entropy, a recent
concept from computational geometry that enables algorithms to adapt to the
"sortedness" of their input. While range-partition entropy provides strong
guarantees in algorithm design, it has not yet been made accessible to deep
learning. In this work, we (i) propose the first differentiable approximation
of range-partition entropy, enabling its use as a trainable loss or
regularizer; (ii) design EntropyNet, a neural module that restructures data
into low-entropy forms to accelerate downstream instance-optimal algorithms;
and (iii) extend this principle beyond geometry by applying entropy
regularization directly to Transformer attention. Across tasks, we demonstrate
that differentiable entropy improves efficiency without degrading correctness:
in geometry, our method achieves up to $4.1\times$ runtime speedups with
negligible error ($<0.2%$); in deep learning, it induces structured attention
patterns that yield 6% higher accuracy at 80% sparsity compared to L1
baselines. Our theoretical analysis provides approximation bounds for the
estimator, and extensive ablations validate design choices. These results
suggest that entropy-bounded computation is not only theoretically elegant but
also a practical mechanism for adaptive learning, efficiency, and structured
representation.

Motivation: 虽然柏拉图表示假说认为神经网络会收敛到相似的表示，但神经算子的表示特性在科学计算中日益重要却未被充分探索，需要开发新的可解释性方法。

Method: 扩展稀疏自编码器(SAEs)到提升空间和无限维函数空间，提出lifted-SAE和SAE神经算子，比较它们的推理和训练动态。

Result: 提升和算子模块引入了有益的归纳偏置，实现了更快的恢复、改进的平滑概念恢复，以及跨不同分辨率的鲁棒推理，这是神经算子独有的特性。

Conclusion: 该框架成功地将稀疏模型恢复方法扩展到神经算子，为大型神经算子的机制可解释性提供了有效工具，展示了在提升空间和函数空间中工作的优势。

Abstract: We frame the problem of unifying representations in neural models as one of
sparse model recovery and introduce a framework that extends sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to lifted spaces and infinite-dimensional function spaces,
enabling mechanistic interpretability of large neural operators (NO). While the
Platonic Representation Hypothesis suggests that neural networks converge to
similar representations across architectures, the representational properties
of neural operators remain underexplored despite their growing importance in
scientific computing. We compare the inference and training dynamics of SAEs,
lifted-SAE, and SAE neural operators. We highlight how lifting and operator
modules introduce beneficial inductive biases, enabling faster recovery,
improved recovery of smooth concepts, and robust inference across varying
resolutions, a property unique to neural operators.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星图像机器学习在实际应用中受限于标注训练数据的稀疏性、空间聚集性，现有研究主要关注模型架构而非数据条件建模，导致科学家和政策制定者不确定如何有效收集额外数据来最大化性能。

Method: 提出了空间训练数据优化的首个问题框架，考虑了异构数据收集成本和现实预算约束，开发了新颖的优化方法来解决这一问题。

Conclusion: 该问题框架和方法设计用于跨SatML应用领域的泛化，特别关注多哥农业调查数据增强的实际应用场景，为大规模监测提供了有效的采样优化解决方案。

Abstract: In applications across agriculture, ecology, and human development, machine
learning with satellite imagery (SatML) is limited by the sparsity of labeled
training data. While satellite data cover the globe, labeled training datasets
for SatML are often small, spatially clustered, and collected for other
purposes (e.g., administrative surveys or field measurements). Despite the
pervasiveness of this issue in practice, past SatML research has largely
focused on new model architectures and training algorithms to handle scarce
training data, rather than modeling data conditions directly. This leaves
scientists and policymakers who wish to use SatML for large-scale monitoring
uncertain about whether and how to collect additional data to maximize
performance. Here, we present the first problem formulation for the
optimization of spatial training data in the presence of heterogeneous data
collection costs and realistic budget constraints, as well as novel methods for
addressing this problem. In experiments simulating different problem settings
across three continents and four tasks, our strategies reveal substantial gains
from sample optimization. Further experiments delineate settings for which
optimized sampling is particularly effective. The problem formulation and
methods we introduce are designed to generalize across application domains for

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高维数据计算挑战，开发能够有效处理流形上函数逼近的方法，特别是在稀疏CT重建等应用中需要高效准确的函数近似。

Method: 基于扩散映射框架，利用距离矩阵的低秩结构进行降维（SVD），并开发在线更新机制以高效整合新数据。

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法在准确性和效率方面均优于经典前馈神经网络和插值方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法为流形上的函数逼近提供了有效解决方案，具有较好的计算效率和扩展性，特别适用于高维数据处理。

Abstract: We propose a data-driven method for approximating real-valued functions on
smooth manifolds, building on the Diffusion Maps framework under the manifold
hypothesis. Given pointwise evaluations of a function, the method constructs a
smooth extension to the ambient space by exploiting diffusion geometry and its
connection to the heat equation and the Laplace-Beltrami operator.
  To address the computational challenges of high-dimensional data, we
introduce a dimensionality reduction strategy based on the low-rank structure
of the distance matrix, revealed via singular value decomposition (SVD). In
addition, we develop an online updating mechanism that enables efficient
incorporation of new data, thereby improving scalability and reducing
computational cost.
  Numerical experiments, including applications to sparse CT reconstruction,
demonstrate that the proposed methodology outperforms classical feedforward
neural networks and interpolation methods in terms of both accuracy and
efficiency.

Conclusion: 对抗协同进化是学习工具性世界模型的有力方法，能够推动智能体向更深战略层次和更强鲁棒性发展

Abstract: World models that infer and predict environmental dynamics are foundational
to embodied intelligence. However, their potential is often limited by the
finite complexity and implicit biases of hand-crafted training environments. To
develop truly generalizable and robust agents, we need environments that scale
in complexity alongside the agents learning within them. In this work, we
reframe the challenge of environment generation as the problem of learning a
goal-conditioned, generative world model. We propose a system where a
generative **Attacker** agent learns an implicit world model to synthesize
increasingly difficult challenges for a team of cooperative **Defender**
agents. The Attacker's objective is not passive prediction, but active,
goal-driven interaction: it models and generates world states (i.e.,
configurations of enemy units) specifically to exploit the Defenders'
weaknesses. Concurrently, the embodied Defender team learns a cooperative
policy to overcome these generated worlds. This co-evolutionary dynamic creates
a self-scaling curriculum where the world model continuously adapts to
challenge the decision-making policy of the agents, providing an effectively
infinite stream of novel and relevant training scenarios. We demonstrate that
this framework leads to the emergence of complex behaviors, such as the world
model learning to generate flanking and shielding formations, and the defenders
learning coordinated focus-fire and spreading tactics. Our findings position
adversarial co-evolution as a powerful method for learning instrumental world
models that drive agents toward greater strategic depth and robustness.

TL;DR: 该论文发现奖励函数的低秩结构能够使稀疏奖励强化学习从指数级样本复杂度转变为多项式级复杂度，提出了Policy-Aware Matrix Completion (PAMC)方法，在100个领域的评估中显示超过一半存在可利用结构，样本效率提升1.6-2.1倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索奖励函数的基本属性如何影响稀疏奖励强化学习的效率，特别是低秩结构在奖励矩阵中的作用，以解决样本复杂度高的问题。

Method: 提出了Policy-Aware Matrix Completion (PAMC)方法，将矩阵补全理论与强化学习相结合，通过策略依赖采样分析，提供奖励自由表示学习、分布自由置信集和鲁棒补全保证。

Result: 在100个系统采样领域的预注册评估中，发现超过一半存在可利用结构，PAMC相比强探索、结构化和表示学习基线，样本效率提升1.6-2.1倍，仅增加约20%计算开销。

Conclusion: 结构奖励学习是一个有前景的新范式，对机器人、医疗保健等安全关键、样本昂贵的应用具有直接意义。

Abstract: What fundamental properties of reward functions enable efficient
sparse-reward reinforcement learning? We address this question through the lens
of low-rank structure in reward matrices, showing that such structure induces a
sharp transition from exponential to polynomial sample complexity, the first
result of this kind for sparse-reward RL. We introduce Policy-Aware Matrix
Completion (PAMC), which connects matrix completion theory with reinforcement
learning via a new analysis of policy-dependent sampling. Our framework
provides: (i) impossibility results for general sparse reward observation, (ii)
reward-free representation learning from dynamics, (iii) distribution-free
confidence sets via conformal prediction, and (iv) robust completion guarantees
that degrade gracefully when low-rank structure is only approximate.
Empirically, we conduct a pre-registered evaluation across 100 systematically
sampled domains, finding exploitable structure in over half. PAMC improves
sample efficiency by factors between 1.6 and 2.1 compared to strong
exploration, structured, and representation-learning baselines, while adding
only about 20 percent computational overhead.These results establish structural
reward learning as a promising new paradigm, with immediate implications for
robotics, healthcare, and other safety-critical, sample-expensive applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADAPT-Z是一个针对时间序列在线学习的创新方法，通过更新潜在因素的表示而非传统参数选择，解决了分布漂移和延迟反馈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列预测面临分布漂移的挑战，特别是在在线部署场景中需要持续适应变化模式。现有方法主要关注参数选择和更新策略，但忽视了分布漂移的根本原因——潜在因素的变化。

Method: 提出ADAPT-Z方法，利用适配器模块结合当前特征表示和历史梯度信息，在潜在空间(Z-space)中进行自动增量调整，解决多步预测中的延迟反馈问题。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在多个数据集上持续优于无适应的基准模型，并超越了最先进的在线学习方法。

Conclusion: 通过更新潜在因素的表示而非传统参数，ADAPT-Z为时间序列在线学习提供了更有效的解决方案，特别是在处理分布漂移和延迟反馈方面表现出色。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is of significant importance across various domains.
However, it faces significant challenges due to distribution shift. This issue
becomes particularly pronounced in online deployment scenarios where data
arrives sequentially, requiring models to adapt continually to evolving
patterns. Current time series online learning methods focus on two main
aspects: selecting suitable parameters to update (e.g., final layer weights or
adapter modules) and devising suitable update strategies (e.g., using recent
batches, replay buffers, or averaged gradients). We challenge the conventional
parameter selection approach, proposing that distribution shifts stem from
changes in underlying latent factors influencing the data. Consequently,
updating the feature representations of these latent factors may be more
effective. To address the critical problem of delayed feedback in multi-step
forecasting (where true values arrive much later than predictions), we
introduce ADAPT-Z (Automatic Delta Adjustment via Persistent Tracking in
Z-space). ADAPT-Z utilizes an adapter module that leverages current feature
representations combined with historical gradient information to enable robust
parameter updates despite the delay. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms standard base models without adaptation and
surpasses state-of-the-art online learning approaches across multiple datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高频(mmWave和sub-THz)信号容易被阻塞，面的散射特性影响连接性能，需要分析表面粗糖度对散射行为的影响。

Method: 收集15种室内材料的78,000个点数据，分割成3cm×3cm补丁，提取平面角度、强度等特征，使用Random Forest、XGBoost和神经网络进行分类。

Result: 集成树模型在准确性和稳健性方面表现最佳，LiDAR特征能够描述粗糖度导致的散射效应。

Conclusion: 该框架可以生成散射感知环境地图和数字双生体，支持周期性网络的适应性材料管理和连接性优化。

Abstract: Reliable connectivity in millimeter-wave (mmWave) and sub-terahertz (sub-THz)
networks depends on reflections from surrounding surfaces, as high-frequency
signals are highly vulnerable to blockage. The scattering behavior of a surface
is determined not only by material permittivity but also by roughness, which
governs whether energy remains in the specular direction or is diffusely
scattered. This paper presents a LiDAR-driven machine learning framework for
classifying indoor surfaces into semi-specular and low-specular categories,
using optical reflectivity as a proxy for electromagnetic scattering behavior.
A dataset of over 78,000 points from 15 representative indoor materials was
collected and partitioned into 3 cm x 3 cm patches to enable classification
from partial views. Patch-level features capturing geometry and intensity,
including elevation angle, natural-log-scaled intensity, and max-to-mean ratio,
were extracted and used to train Random Forest, XGBoost, and neural network
classifiers. Results show that ensemble tree-based models consistently provide
the best trade-off between accuracy and robustness, confirming that
LiDAR-derived features capture roughness-induced scattering effects. The
proposed framework enables the generation of scatter aware environment maps and
digital twins, supporting adaptive beam management, blockage recovery, and
environment-aware connectivity in next-generation networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车辆-基础设施(V2I)系统需要准确预测通信链路质量指标，现代车辆传感器数据的丰富性促使使用多模态大语言模型，但其缺乏三维空间理解能力

Method: 提出轻量级插拔式鸟视图(BEV)注入连接器，通过收集周围车辆传感数据构建环境BEV表示，并与自车输入融合为大语言模型提供空间上下文。使用CARLA模拟器和MATLAB光线追踪构建实际多模态学习环境

Result: 在三个V2I链路预测任务中（视线/非视线分类、链路可用性、阻塞预测）均获得一致性性能提升。与单车基线相比，准确率平均提升达13.9%，在雨天和夜间挑战性条件下性能提升达32.7%，证明框架在恶劣环境下的稳健性

Conclusion: BEV注入框架有效解决了MLLM缺乏空间理解的问题，显著提升了V2I通信质量预测性能，尤其在复杂环境下表现更优异

Abstract: Accurate prediction of communication link quality metrics is essential for
vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) systems, enabling smooth handovers, efficient
beam management, and reliable low-latency communication. The increasing
availability of sensor data from modern vehicles motivates the use of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) because of their adaptability across
tasks and reasoning capabilities. However, MLLMs inherently lack
three-dimensional spatial understanding. To overcome this limitation, a
lightweight, plug-and-play bird's-eye view (BEV) injection connector is
proposed. In this framework, a BEV of the environment is constructed by
collecting sensing data from neighboring vehicles. This BEV representation is
then fused with the ego vehicle's input to provide spatial context for the
large language model. To support realistic multimodal learning, a co-simulation
environment combining CARLA simulator and MATLAB-based ray tracing is developed
to generate RGB, LiDAR, GPS, and wireless signal data across varied scenarios.
Instructions and ground-truth responses are programmatically extracted from the
ray-tracing outputs. Extensive experiments are conducted across three V2I link
prediction tasks: line-of-sight (LoS) versus non-line-of-sight (NLoS)
classification, link availability, and blockage prediction. Simulation results
show that the proposed BEV injection framework consistently improved
performance across all tasks. The results indicate that, compared to an
ego-only baseline, the proposed approach improves the macro-average of the
accuracy metrics by up to 13.9%. The results also show that this performance
gain increases by up to 32.7% under challenging rainy and nighttime conditions,
confirming the robustness of the framework in adverse settings.

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) and Knowledge Distillation (KD) are
combined to achieve competitive performance in creating low-bit deep learning
models. Existing KD and QAT works focus on improving the accuracy of quantized
models from the network output perspective by designing better KD loss
functions or optimizing QAT's forward and backward propagation. However,
limited attention has been given to understanding the impact of input
transformations, such as data augmentation (DA). The relationship between
quantization-aware KD and DA remains unexplored. In this paper, we address the
question: how to select a good DA in quantization-aware KD, especially for the
models with low precisions? We propose a novel metric which evaluates DAs
according to their capacity to maximize the Contextual Mutual Information--the
information not directly related to an image's label--while also ensuring the
predictions for each class are close to the ground truth labels on average. The
proposed method automatically ranks and selects DAs, requiring minimal training
overhead, and it is compatible with any KD or QAT algorithm. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that selecting DA strategies using our metric
significantly improves state-of-the-art QAT and KD works across various model
architectures and datasets.

Motivation: 现有方法在捕捉多变量时间序列的领先-滞后依赖关系时，往往忽略了多分组尺度的分层效应，无法全面捕捉复杂系统中的领先-滞后动态。

Abstract: Multi-variate time series (MTS) forecasting is crucial for various
applications. Existing methods have shown promising results owing to their
strong ability to capture intra- and inter-variate dependencies. However, these
methods often overlook lead-lag dependencies at multiple grouping scales,
failing to capture hierarchical lead-lag effects in complex systems. To this
end, we propose MillGNN, a novel \underline{g}raph \underline{n}eural
\underline{n}etwork-based method that learns \underline{m}ult\underline{i}ple
grouping scale \underline{l}ead-\underline{l}ag dependencies for MTS
forecasting, which can comprehensively capture lead-lag effects considering
variate-wise and group-wise dynamics and decays. Specifically, MillGNN
introduces two key innovations: (1) a scale-specific lead-lag graph learning
module that integrates cross-correlation coefficients and dynamic decaying
features derived from real-time inputs and time lags to learn lead-lag
dependencies for each scale, which can model evolving lead-lag dependencies
with statistical interpretability and data-driven flexibility; (2) a
hierarchical lead-lag message passing module that passes lead-lag messages at
multiple grouping scales in a structured way to simultaneously propagate intra-
and inter-scale lead-lag effects, which can capture multi-scale lead-lag
effects with a balance of comprehensiveness and efficiency. Experimental
results on 11 datasets demonstrate the superiority of MillGNN for long-term and
short-term MTS forecasting, compared with 16 state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a leading cause of death worldwide and
contributes significantly to annual healthcare expenditures. To develop a

perceptron (MLP) neural network, trained on 50 key urinary peptide biomarkers
selected via genetic algorithms. Treatment and control groups, each comprising
345 individuals, were balanced using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling
Technique (SMOTE). The neural network was trained using a stratified validation
strategy. Using a network with three hidden layers of 60 neurons each and an
output layer of two neurons, the model achieved a precision, sensitivity, and
specificity of 95.67 percent, with an F1-score of 0.9565. The area under the
ROC curve (AUC) reached 0.9748 for both classes, while the Matthews correlation
coefficient (MCC) and Cohen's kappa coefficient were 0.9134 and 0.9131,
respectively, demonstrating its reliability in detecting CHD. These results

Abstract: Protein representation learning (PRL) is crucial for understanding
structure-function relationships, yet current sequence- and graph-based methods
fail to capture the hierarchical organization inherent in protein structures.
We introduce Topotein, a comprehensive framework that applies topological deep
learning to PRL through the novel Protein Combinatorial Complex (PCC) and
Topology-Complete Perceptron Network (TCPNet). Our PCC represents proteins at
multiple hierarchical levels -- from residues to secondary structures to
complete proteins -- while preserving geometric information at each level.
TCPNet employs SE(3)-equivariant message passing across these hierarchical
structures, enabling more effective capture of multi-scale structural patterns.
Through extensive experiments on four PRL tasks, TCPNet consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art geometric graph neural networks. Our approach
demonstrates particular strength in tasks such as fold classification which
require understanding of secondary structure arrangements, validating the
importance of hierarchical topological features for protein analysis.

Abstract: Failures in satellite components are costly and challenging to address, often
requiring significant human and material resources. Embedding a hybrid AI-based
system for fault detection directly in the satellite can greatly reduce this
burden by allowing earlier detection. However, such systems must operate with
extremely high reliability. To ensure this level of dependability, we employ
the formal verification tool Marabou to verify the local robustness of the
neural network models used in the AI-based algorithm. This tool allows us to
quantify how much a model's input can be perturbed before its output behavior
becomes unstable, thereby improving trustworthiness with respect to its
performance under uncertainty.

Abstract: Over the past decade, the use of machine learning (ML) models in healthcare
applications has rapidly increased. Despite high performance, modern ML models
do not always capture patterns the end user requires. For example, a model may
predict a non-monotonically decreasing relationship between cancer stage and
survival, keeping all other features fixed. In this paper, we present a
reproducible framework for investigating this misalignment between model
behavior and clinical experiential learning, focusing on the effects of
underspecification of modern ML pipelines. In a prostate cancer outcome
prediction case study, we first identify and address these inconsistencies by
incorporating clinical knowledge, collected by a survey, via constraints into
the ML model, and subsequently analyze the impact on model performance and
behavior across degrees of underspecification. The approach shows that aligning
the ML model with clinical experiential learning is possible without
compromising performance. Motivated by recent literature in generative AI, we
further examine the feasibility of a feedback-driven alignment approach in
non-generative AI clinical risk prediction models through a randomized
experiment with clinicians. Our findings illustrate that, by eliciting
clinicians' model preferences using our proposed methodology, the larger the
difference in how the constrained and unconstrained models make predictions for
a patient, the more apparent the difference is in clinical interpretation.

Method: 提出FedQuad方法，显式优化较小的类内方差和较大的类间方差，最小化相似对距离同时最大化负对距离，在共享特征空间中解耦客户端数据

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上，在各种数据分布和多个客户端设置下，相比现有方法表现出优越性能

Conclusion: 基于度量学习的策略在监督学习和联邦学习范式中都能有效解决联邦设置中的表示学习挑战，FedQuad方法为解决数据异构性问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) provides decentralised model training, which
effectively tackles problems such as distributed data and privacy preservation.
However, the generalisation of global models frequently faces challenges from
data heterogeneity among clients. This challenge becomes even more pronounced
when datasets are limited in size and class imbalance. To address data
heterogeneity, we propose a novel method, \textit{FedQuad}, that explicitly
optimises smaller intra-class variance and larger inter-class variance across
clients, thereby decreasing the negative impact of model aggregation on the
global model over client representations. Our approach minimises the distance
between similar pairs while maximising the distance between negative pairs,
effectively disentangling client data in the shared feature space. We evaluate
our method on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets under various data
distributions and with many clients, demonstrating superior performance
compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of
metric learning-based strategies within both supervised and federated learning
paradigms, highlighting their efficacy in addressing representational learning
challenges in federated settings.

*Amirmohammad Farzaneh,Matteo Zecchin,Osvaldo Simeone*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SP-CCI是一种新的反事实推理框架，通过合成数据增强校准集，在保持边际覆盖率的同时显著减少预测区间宽度，解决了传统方法在处理不平衡治疗时过于保守的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的反事实共形推理方法虽然提供边际覆盖保证，但在治疗不平衡、反事实样本稀缺时往往产生过于保守的预测区间，需要更精确的区间估计方法。

Method: 提出SP-CCI框架，使用预训练的反事实模型生成合成反事实标签来增强校准集，结合风险控制预测集和基于预测驱动推理的去偏步骤来确保有效性。

Result: 理论证明SP-CCI在保持边际覆盖率的同时获得更紧致的预测区间，实证结果表明在不同数据集上SP-CCI相比标准CCI方法能持续减少区间宽度。

Conclusion: SP-CCI通过合成数据增强和去偏校准，有效解决了反事实推理中区间过于保守的问题，为个体反事实结果提供了更可靠的预测区间估计。

Abstract: This work addresses the problem of constructing reliable prediction intervals
for individual counterfactual outcomes. Existing conformal counterfactual
inference (CCI) methods provide marginal coverage guarantees but often produce
overly conservative intervals, particularly under treatment imbalance when
counterfactual samples are scarce. We introduce synthetic data-powered CCI
(SP-CCI), a new framework that augments the calibration set with synthetic
counterfactual labels generated by a pre-trained counterfactual model. To
ensure validity, SP-CCI incorporates synthetic samples into a conformal
calibration procedure based on risk-controlling prediction sets (RCPS) with a
debiasing step informed by prediction-powered inference (PPI). We prove that
SP-CCI achieves tighter prediction intervals while preserving marginal
coverage, with theoretical guarantees under both exact and approximate
importance weighting. Empirical results on different datasets confirm that
SP-CCI consistently reduces interval width compared to standard CCI across all
settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于社会负担的新公平性框架和MISOB算法，用于解决算法追索中的不公平问题，在保持分类器准确性的同时降低所有群体的社会负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习在敏感决策中的应用增加，算法追索（提供可行动步骤来逆转负面决策）的需求日益重要，但现有研究对追索过程中的公平性保障存在担忧。

Method: 提出了基于社会负担的公平性框架，开发了MISOB实用算法，该算法在现实世界条件下广泛适用，通过理论分析将追索和分类中的公平性保障正式联系起来。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的实证结果表明，MISOB算法在不影响整体分类器准确性的情况下，降低了所有群体的社会负担。

Conclusion: 该研究为算法追索中的不公平问题提供了全面的理论特征描述，提出了有效的解决方案，证明了新框架在实践中的可行性和有效性。

Abstract: Machine learning based predictions are increasingly used in sensitive
decision-making applications that directly affect our lives. This has led to
extensive research into ensuring the fairness of classifiers. Beyond just fair
classification, emerging legislation now mandates that when a classifier
delivers a negative decision, it must also offer actionable steps an individual
can take to reverse that outcome. This concept is known as algorithmic
recourse. Nevertheless, many researchers have expressed concerns about the
fairness guarantees within the recourse process itself. In this work, we
provide a holistic theoretical characterization of unfairness in algorithmic
recourse, formally linking fairness guarantees in recourse and classification,
and highlighting limitations of the standard equal cost paradigm. We then
introduce a novel fairness framework based on social burden, along with a
practical algorithm (MISOB), broadly applicable under real-world conditions.
Empirical results on real-world datasets show that MISOB reduces the social
burden across all groups without compromising overall classifier accuracy.

Motivation: 解决机器学习分类任务中数据生成的需求，特别是开发无需额外LLM训练就能生成高质量合成表格数据的方法。

Method: 使用大型语言模型(LLMs)构建智能体工作流，通过自动迭代过程和反馈机制来改进生成的数据，并可以融入外部知识。

Conclusion: 智能体工作流在LLM-based数据生成方面具有巨大潜力，为未来的数据生成方法开辟了新方向。

Abstract: The generation of data is a common approach to improve the performance of
machine learning tasks, among which is the training of models for
classification. In this paper, we present TAGAL, a collection of methods able
to generate synthetic tabular data using an agentic workflow. The methods
leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for an automatic and iterative process
that uses feedback to improve the generated data without any further LLM
training. The use of LLMs also allows for the addition of external knowledge in
the generation process. We evaluate TAGAL across diverse datasets and different
aspects of quality for the generated data. We look at the utility of downstream
ML models, both by training classifiers on synthetic data only and by combining
real and synthetic data. Moreover, we compare the similarities between the real
and the generated data. We show that TAGAL is able to perform on par with
state-of-the-art approaches that require LLM training and generally outperforms
other training-free approaches. These findings highlight the potential of
agentic workflow and open new directions for LLM-based data generation methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统注意力机制直接比较查询和键，缺乏对序列动态特性的显式建模。本文旨在将动力学模型直接集成到注意力计算中，提高对序列不确定性的建模能力

Method: 将输入序列建模为线性随机微分方程的离散观测，利用微分Lyapunov方程的闭式解传播成对不确定性，注意力权重对应于传播精度矩阵的鲁棒残差重加权

Result: 提出了计算和内存复杂度与标准注意力相同的简化变体，在动力学和过程噪声消失极限下，通过小角度近似可恢复普通点积注意力

Conclusion: AFA提供了一种将动力学模型直接融入注意力计算的新范式，为序列建模提供了更丰富的理论基础和灵活性

Abstract: We introduce Adaptive Filter Attention (AFA), a novel attention mechanism
that incorporates a learnable dynamics model directly into the computation of
attention weights. Rather than comparing queries and keys directly, we model
the input sequence as discrete observations of a linear stochastic differential
equation (SDE). By imposing a linear dynamics model with simultaneously
diagonalizable state matrices and noise covariances, we can make use of a
closed-form solution to the differential Lyapunov equation to efficiently
propagate pairwise uncertainties through the dynamics. Attention naturally
arises as the maximum likelihood solution for this linear SDE, with attention
weights corresponding to robust residual-based reweightings of the propagated
pairwise precisions. Imposing an additional constraint on the state matrix's
eigenvalues leads to a simplified variant with the same computational and
memory complexity as standard attention. In the limit of vanishing dynamics and
process noise, and using a small-angle approximation, we recover ordinary
dot-product attention.

Abstract: Self-supervised speech models have demonstrated impressive performance in
speech processing, but their effectiveness on non-speech data remains
underexplored. We study the transfer learning capabilities of such models on
bioacoustic detection and classification tasks. We show that models such as
HuBERT, WavLM, and XEUS can generate rich latent representations of animal
sounds across taxa. We analyze the models properties with linear probing on
time-averaged representations. We then extend the approach to account for the
effect of time-wise information with other downstream architectures. Finally,
we study the implication of frequency range and noise on performance. Notably,
our results are competitive with fine-tuned bioacoustic pre-trained models and
show the impact of noise-robust pre-training setups. These findings highlight
the potential of speech-based self-supervised learning as an efficient
framework for advancing bioacoustic research.

TL;DR: 本文研究了时间序列预测模型中的成员推理攻击，提出了两种新攻击方法并发现预测模型存在隐私风险，特别是在用户级攻击中表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 成员推理攻击在分类模型中已被广泛研究，但在时间序列预测领域的应用和影响仍未被充分探索，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 提出了两种攻击方法：(1)将多变量LiRA攻击从分类模型适配到时间序列预测；(2)新颖的端到端学习方法Deep Time Series (DTS)攻击。在TUH-EEG和ELD数据集上针对LSTM和N-HiTS预测架构进行评估。

Result: 预测模型存在脆弱性，用户级攻击经常实现完美检测。提出的方法在多个设置中表现最强，预测时间越长、训练群体越小，脆弱性越高。

Conclusion: 为时间序列预测的隐私风险评估建立了新的基准，揭示了预测模型在成员推理攻击下的隐私风险，与大型语言模型中观察到的趋势相似。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether specific data
were used to train a model. While extensively studied on classification models,
their impact on time series forecasting remains largely unexplored. We address
this gap by introducing two new attacks: (i) an adaptation of multivariate
LiRA, a state-of-the-art MIA originally developed for classification models, to
the time-series forecasting setting, and (ii) a novel end-to-end learning
approach called Deep Time Series (DTS) attack. We benchmark these methods
against adapted versions of other leading attacks from the classification
setting.
  We evaluate all attacks in realistic settings on the TUH-EEG and ELD
datasets, targeting two strong forecasting architectures, LSTM and the
state-of-the-art N-HiTS, under both record- and user-level threat models. Our
results show that forecasting models are vulnerable, with user-level attacks
often achieving perfect detection. The proposed methods achieve the strongest
performance in several settings, establishing new baselines for privacy risk
assessment in time series forecasting. Furthermore, vulnerability increases
with longer prediction horizons and smaller training populations, echoing
trends observed in large language models.

Motivation: 对现有GNN过平滑分析工作进行补充和完善，特别是在Dirichlet能量分析方面提供更深入的理论见解，探索缓解过平滑的实用方法。

Method: 通过理论分析证明在特定光谱条件下Dirichlet能量的指数衰减特性，扩展到光谱多项式滤波器，并通过边删除和权重放大实验进行验证。

Result: 证明了Dirichlet能量随网络深度指数衰减的理论结果，实验显示了Dirichlet能量增加的情况，为缓解过平滑提供了实用线索。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解GNN中的过平滑现象提供了新的理论视角，并指出了通过调整网络结构参数来缓解过平滑的实际可行方法。

Abstract: We comment on Cai and Wang (2020, arXiv:2006.13318), who analyze
over-smoothing in GNNs via Dirichlet energy. We show that under mild spectral
conditions (including with Leaky-ReLU), the Dirichlet energy of node embeddings
decreases exponentially with depth; we further extend the result to spectral
polynomial filters and provide a short proof for the Leaky-ReLU case.
Experiments on edge deletion and weight amplification illustrate when Dirichlet
energy increases, hinting at practical ways to relieve over-smoothing.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Set Block Decoding (SBD) 是一种新的解码范式，通过结合标准下一个令牌预测和掩码令牌预测，实现并行采样多个非连续未来令牌，可将生成所需前向传播次数减少3-5倍，同时保持与标准方法相同的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语言模型在推理阶段面临高计算和内存成本的问题，特别是在解码阶段，这限制了实际部署的效率。

Method: 提出Set Block Decoding (SBD)范式，在单一架构中整合标准下一个令牌预测(NTP)和掩码令牌预测(MATP)，允许并行采样多个非连续未来令牌，无需架构修改或额外训练超参数，可通过微调现有模型实现。

Result: 通过对Llama-3.1 8B和Qwen-3 8B进行微调，SBD实现了生成所需前向传播次数减少3-5倍，同时达到与等效NTP训练相同的性能表现。

Conclusion: SBD提供了一种简单灵活的解码加速方法，利用离散扩散文献中的先进求解器，在不牺牲准确性的情况下显著提升生成速度，且保持与精确KV缓存的兼容性。

Abstract: Autoregressive next token prediction language models offer powerful
capabilities but face significant challenges in practical deployment due to the
high computational and memory costs of inference, particularly during the
decoding stage. We introduce Set Block Decoding (SBD), a simple and flexible
paradigm that accelerates generation by integrating standard next token
prediction (NTP) and masked token prediction (MATP) within a single
architecture. SBD allows the model to sample multiple, not necessarily
consecutive, future tokens in parallel, a key distinction from previous
acceleration methods. This flexibility allows the use of advanced solvers from
the discrete diffusion literature, offering significant speedups without
sacrificing accuracy. SBD requires no architectural changes or extra training
hyperparameters, maintains compatibility with exact KV-caching, and can be
implemented by fine-tuning existing next token prediction models. By
fine-tuning Llama-3.1 8B and Qwen-3 8B, we demonstrate that SBD enables a 3-5x
reduction in the number of forward passes required for generation while
achieving same performance as equivalent NTP training.

TL;DR: ZooCast是一个集成多个时间序列基础模型的框架，通过统一嵌入空间动态选择最优模型进行零样本预测，在保持单模型效率的同时提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型各有优势，但没有一个模型在所有场景下都表现最佳，需要利用不同模型的互补能力来提升零样本预测性能。

Method: 提出ZooCast框架，采用One-Embedding-Fits-All范式构建统一表示空间，每个模型用单个嵌入表示，通过相似度匹配为不同任务动态选择最优模型。

Result: 在GIFT-Eval零样本预测基准测试中表现出色，保持单模型效率的同时实现性能提升，支持顺序模型添加且开销极小。

Conclusion: ZooCast有效整合了不同时间序列基础模型的优势，通过动态模型选择实现了更好的零样本预测性能，为实际应用提供了高效的集成解决方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) has significantly
advanced zero-shot forecasting, enabling predictions for unseen time series
without task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive research has confirmed that no
single TSFM excels universally, as different models exhibit preferences for
distinct temporal patterns. This diversity suggests an opportunity: how to take
advantage of the complementary abilities of TSFMs. To this end, we propose
ZooCast, which characterizes each model's distinct forecasting strengths.
ZooCast can intelligently assemble current TSFMs into a model zoo that
dynamically selects optimal models for different forecasting tasks. Our key
innovation lies in the One-Embedding-Fits-All paradigm that constructs a
unified representation space where each model in the zoo is represented by a
single embedding, enabling efficient similarity matching for all tasks.
Experiments demonstrate ZooCast's strong performance on the GIFT-Eval zero-shot
forecasting benchmark while maintaining the efficiency of a single TSFM. In
real-world scenarios with sequential model releases, the framework seamlessly
adds new models for progressive accuracy gains with negligible overhead.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法使降维过程更快、更可靠，能够有效解释预期结构缺失的原因并优化投影质量。

Abstract: Dimensionality Reduction (DR) is widely used for visualizing high-dimensional
data, often with the goal of revealing expected cluster structure. However,
such a structure may not always appear in the projections. Existing DR quality
metrics assess projection reliability (to some extent) or cluster structure
quality, but do not explain why expected structures are missing. Visual
Analytics solutions can help, but are often time-consuming due to the large
hyperparameter space. This paper addresses this problem by leveraging a recent
framework that divides the DR process into two phases: a relationship phase,
where similarity relationships are modeled, and a mapping phase, where the data
is projected accordingly. We introduce two supervised metrics, precision and
recall, to evaluate the relationship phase. These metrics quantify how well the
modeled relationships align with an expected cluster structure based on some
set of labels representing this structure. We illustrate their application
using t-SNE and UMAP, and validate the approach through various usage
scenarios. Our approach can guide hyperparameter tuning, uncover projection
artifacts, and determine if the expected structure is captured in the
relationships, making the DR process faster and more reliable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前序列模型在长程依赖性方面的能力缺乏理论分析，阻碍了系统性的改进。需要从数学角度定义和比较SSM与Transformer模型的长程依赖建模能力。

Method: 使用隐藏状态对过去输入的偏导数来数学定义长程依赖性，理论分析SSM和Transformer模型在这一定义下的表现，并提出了一种新的SSM隐藏状态更新方法。

Result: 证明SSM的长程依赖性按序列长度指数衰减（类似RNN的记忆函数），而Transformer的注意力机制更灵活且不受指数衰减限制，在足够资源和适当训练下理论上能更好地建模长程依赖性。新提出的SSM更新方法在标准正态分布输入下被证明是稳定的。

Conclusion: 注意力机制在长程依赖性建模方面具有更大的灵活性，而SSM在计算效率上更优。提出的新方法尝试结合两者优势，为进一步系统性改进长程依赖建模能力提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Long-range dependency is one of the most desired properties of recent
sequence models such as state-space models (particularly Mamba) and transformer
models. New model architectures are being actively developed and benchmarked
for prediction tasks requiring long-range dependency. However, the capability
of modeling long-range dependencies of these models has not been investigated
from a theoretical perspective, which hinders a systematic improvement on this
aspect. In this work, we mathematically define long-range dependency using the
derivative of hidden states with respect to past inputs and compare the
capability of SSM and transformer models of modeling long-range dependency
based on this definition. We showed that the long-range dependency of SSM
decays exponentially with the sequence length, which aligns with the
exponential decay of memory function in RNN. But the attention mechanism used
in transformers is more flexible and is not constrained to exponential decay,
which could in theory perform better at modeling long-range dependency with
sufficient training data, computing resources, and proper training. To combine
the flexibility of long-range dependency of attention mechanism and computation
efficiency of SSM, we propose a new formulation for hidden state update in SSM
and prove its stability under a standard Gaussian distribution of the input
data.

Result: 在集中式和联邦学习设置中均优于现有分配策略，实现更好的隐私-效用权衡

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提供对现有方法的诊断见解，还为设计自适应有效的噪声注入方案提供理论指导

Abstract: Layer-wise Gaussian mechanisms (LGM) enhance flexibility in differentially
private deep learning by injecting noise into partitioned gradient vectors.
However, existing methods often rely on heuristic noise allocation strategies,
lacking a rigorous understanding of their theoretical grounding in connecting
noise allocation to formal privacy-utility tradeoffs. In this paper, we present
a unified analytical framework that systematically connects layer-wise noise
injection strategies with their implicit optimization objectives and associated
privacy budget allocations. Our analysis reveals that several existing
approaches optimize ill-posed objectives -- either ignoring inter-layer
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) consistency or leading to inefficient use of the
privacy budget. In response, we propose a SNR-Consistent noise allocation
strategy that unifies both aspects, yielding a noise allocation scheme that
achieves better signal preservation and more efficient privacy budget
utilization. Extensive experiments in both centralized and federated learning
settings demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing
allocation strategies, achieving better privacy-utility tradeoffs. Our
framework not only offers diagnostic insights into prior methods but also
provides theoretical guidance for designing adaptive and effective noise
injection schemes in deep models.

Abstract: Background: Heart failure (HF) research is constrained by limited access to
large, shareable datasets due to privacy regulations and institutional
barriers. Synthetic data generation offers a promising solution to overcome
these challenges while preserving patient confidentiality. Methods: We
generated synthetic HF datasets from institutional data comprising 12,552
unique patients using five deep learning models: tabular variational
autoencoder (TVAE), normalizing flow, ADSGAN, SurvivalGAN, and tabular
denoising diffusion probabilistic models (TabDDPM). We comprehensively
evaluated synthetic data utility through statistical similarity metrics,
survival prediction using machine learning and privacy assessments. Results:
SurvivalGAN and TabDDPM demonstrated high fidelity to the original dataset,
exhibiting similar variable distributions and survival curves after applying
histogram equalization. SurvivalGAN (C-indices: 0.71-0.76) and TVAE (C-indices:
0.73-0.76) achieved the strongest performance in survival prediction
evaluation, closely matched real data performance (C-indices: 0.73-0.76).
Privacy evaluation confirmed protection against re-identification attacks.
Conclusions: Deep learning-based synthetic data generation can produce
high-fidelity, privacy-preserving HF datasets suitable for research
applications. This publicly available synthetic dataset addresses critical data
sharing barriers and provides a valuable resource for advancing HF research and
predictive modeling.

Method: 通过KL散度衡量分布偏移，分析RL和SFT的收敛特性，并在大语言模型和机器人基础模型上进行实验验证

Result: RL在保持先验知识方面显著优于SFT，KL散度是决定遗忘程度的关键因素，RL偏好KL最小化解

Conclusion: 提出"RL剃刀"原则：RL在解决新任务时偏好与原始模型KL距离最小的解决方案

Abstract: Comparison of fine-tuning models with reinforcement learning (RL) and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) reveals that, despite similar performance at a new
task, RL preserves prior knowledge and capabilities significantly better. We
find that the degree of forgetting is determined by the distributional shift,
measured as the KL-divergence between the fine-tuned and base policy evaluated
on the new task. Our analysis reveals that on-policy RL is implicitly biased
towards KL-minimal solutions among the many that solve the new task, whereas
SFT can converge to distributions arbitrarily far from the base model. We
validate these findings through experiments with large language models and
robotic foundation models and further provide theoretical justification for why
on-policy RL updates lead to a smaller KL change. We term this principle
$\textit{RL's Razor}$: among all ways to solve a new task, RL prefers those
closest in KL to the original model.

Conclusion: 利用问题特有结构和改进的用户交互方式，可以高效解决差分隐私中的多目标优化问题，为隐私-性能权衡选择提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is the standard for privacy-preserving analysis,
and introduces a fundamental trade-off between privacy guarantees and model
performance. Selecting the optimal balance is a critical challenge that can be
framed as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem where one first
discovers the set of optimal trade-offs (the Pareto front) and then learns a
decision-maker's preference over them. While a rich body of work on interactive
MOO exists, the standard approach -- modeling the objective functions with
generic surrogates and learning preferences from simple pairwise feedback -- is
inefficient for DP because it fails to leverage the problem's unique structure:
a point on the Pareto front can be generated directly by maximizing accuracy
for a fixed privacy level. Motivated by this property, we first derive the
shape of the trade-off theoretically, which allows us to model the Pareto front
directly and efficiently. To address inefficiency in preference learning, we
replace pairwise comparisons with a more informative interaction. In
particular, we present the user with hypothetical trade-off curves and ask them
to pick their preferred trade-off. Our experiments on differentially private
logistic regression and deep transfer learning across six real-world datasets
show that our method converges to the optimal privacy-accuracy trade-off with
significantly less computational cost and user interaction than baselines.

Method: 通过分析因果和统计结构来识别机器学习失败的根本原因，重点关注图像分析领域，提出了两个新的理论问题框架。

Result: 发现当前公平表示学习方法无法充分解决"无公平午餐"和"子群可分性"问题，揭示了现有方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 需要开发新的方法来应对这些被忽视的问题，为机器学习在敏感领域的可靠部署提供理论指导和技术路径。

Abstract: Machine learning methods often fail when deployed in the real world. Worse
still, they fail in high-stakes situations and across socially sensitive lines.
These issues have a chilling effect on the adoption of machine learning methods
in settings such as medical diagnosis, where they are arguably best-placed to
provide benefits if safely deployed. In this primer, we introduce the causal
and statistical structures which induce failure in machine learning methods for
image analysis. We highlight two previously overlooked problems, which we call
the \textit{no fair lunch} problem and the \textit{subgroup separability}
problem. We elucidate why today's fair representation learning methods fail to
adequately solve them and propose potential paths forward for the field.

Motivation: 现实世界决策问题可以在不同抽象层次编码为因果多臂老虎机问题，但缺乏利用各抽象层次信息和计算优势的通用方法

Method: 提出AT-UCB算法，利用因果抽象理论在计算成本低的粗粒度CMAB实例中探索，然后在目标CMAB中对潜在最优动作子集使用传统UCB算法

Conclusion: AT-UCB算法能够有效利用不同抽象层次的信息优势，在因果多臂老虎机问题中实现更好的性能表现

Abstract: Although real-world decision-making problems can often be encoded as causal
multi-armed bandits (CMABs) at different levels of abstraction, a general
methodology exploiting the information and computational advantages of each
abstraction level is missing. In this paper, we propose AT-UCB, an algorithm
which efficiently exploits shared information between CMAB problem instances
defined at different levels of abstraction. More specifically, AT-UCB leverages
causal abstraction (CA) theory to explore within a cheap-to-simulate and
coarse-grained CMAB instance, before employing the traditional upper confidence
bound (UCB) algorithm on a restricted set of potentially optimal actions in the
CMAB of interest, leading to significant reductions in cumulative regret when
compared to the classical UCB algorithm. We illustrate the advantages of AT-UCB
theoretically, through a novel upper bound on the cumulative regret, and
empirically, by applying AT-UCB to epidemiological simulators with varying
resolution and computational cost.

Abstract: Due to the threat of changing climate and extreme weather events, the
infrastructure of the United States Army installations is at risk. More than
ever, climate resilience measures are needed to protect facility assets that
support critical missions and help generate readiness. As most of the Army
installations within the continental United States rely on commercial energy
and water sources, resilience to the vulnerabilities within independent energy
resources (electricity grids, natural gas pipelines, etc) along with a baseline
understanding of energy usage within installations must be determined. This
paper will propose a data-driven behavioral model to determine behavior
profiles of energy usage on installations. These profiles will be used 1) to
create a baseline assessment of the impact of unexpected disruptions on energy
systems and 2) to benchmark future resiliency measures. In this methodology,
individual building behavior will be represented with models that can
accurately analyze, predict, and cluster multimodal data collected from energy
usage of non-residential buildings. Due to the nature of Army installation
energy usage data, similarly structured open access data will be used to
illustrate this methodology.

TL;DR: 提出SST-iTransformer模型解决城市停车位可用性预测问题，通过多源交通数据整合和自监督时空表示学习，在成都真实数据上取得最优性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 私人汽车快速增长加剧城市停车难题，需要准确预测停车位可用性来支持城市规划管理，现有方法在时空依赖建模和多源数据利用方面存在局限

Method: 使用K-means聚类建立停车集群区域(PCZs)，整合地铁、公交、网约车、出租车等多源交通需求特征。基于iTransformer改进，集成掩码重构自监督学习，采用双分支注意力机制：序列注意力捕获长期时间依赖，通道注意力建模跨变量交互

Result: 在成都真实数据实验中，SST-iTransformer优于Informer、Autoformer等基线模型，达到最低MSE和竞争性MAE。消融研究表明网约车数据贡献最大，出租车次之，固定线路交通特征贡献较小。空间相关性分析显示排除相关停车位历史数据会导致性能显著下降

Conclusion: SST-iTransformer通过有效整合多源交通数据和建模时空依赖关系，为城市停车可用性预测提供了先进的解决方案，强调了空间依赖建模和多源数据利用的重要性

Abstract: The rapid growth of private car ownership has worsened the urban parking
predicament, underscoring the need for accurate and effective parking
availability prediction to support urban planning and management. To address
key limitations in modeling spatio-temporal dependencies and exploiting
multi-source data for parking availability prediction, this study proposes a
novel approach with SST-iTransformer. The methodology leverages K-means
clustering to establish parking cluster zones (PCZs), extracting and
integrating traffic demand characteristics from various transportation modes
(i.e., metro, bus, online ride-hailing, and taxi) associated with the targeted
parking lots. Upgraded on vanilla iTransformer, SST-iTransformer integrates
masking-reconstruction-based pretext tasks for self-supervised spatio-temporal
representation learning, and features an innovative dual-branch attention
mechanism: Series Attention captures long-term temporal dependencies via
patching operations, while Channel Attention models cross-variate interactions
through inverted dimensions. Extensive experiments using real-world data from
Chengdu, China, demonstrate that SST-iTransformer outperforms baseline deep
learning models (including Informer, Autoformer, Crossformer, and
iTransformer), achieving state-of-the-art performance with the lowest mean
squared error (MSE) and competitive mean absolute error (MAE). Comprehensive
ablation studies quantitatively reveal the relative importance of different
data sources: incorporating ride-hailing data provides the largest performance
gains, followed by taxi, whereas fixed-route transit features (bus/metro)
contribute marginally. Spatial correlation analysis further confirms that
excluding historical data from correlated parking lots within PCZs leads to
substantial performance degradation, underscoring the importance of modeling
spatial dependencies.

TL;DR: 基于偏差-方差恰当性关系，提出了主动学习策略，通过偏差减小和批处理策略在异方差实验场景中较传统方法更优


<details>

Motivation: 实际实验场景中存在异方差模型不确定性，且在批处处理时可能存在相关性，需要有效的主动学习策略来处理这种复杂情况

Method: 利用偏差-方差恰当性关系，提出新的主动学习策略，包括基于偏差减小的方法和通过特征值分解策略的批处处理方法

Result: 在批处设置中使用二次估计器时，新方法在异方差实验场景中超越了BALD和Least Confidence等传统方法

Conclusion: 通过偏差-半方差关系和偏差-协方差关系的利用，提出的主动学习策略能够有效处理实际实验中的异方差不确定性问题，并通过批处策略提高效能

Abstract: Real-world experimental scenarios are characterized by the presence of
heteroskedastic aleatoric uncertainty, and this uncertainty can be correlated
in batched settings. The bias--variance tradeoff can be used to write the
expected mean squared error between a model distribution and a ground-truth
random variable as the sum of an epistemic uncertainty term, the bias squared,
and an aleatoric uncertainty term. We leverage this relationship to propose
novel active learning strategies that directly reduce the bias between
experimental rounds, considering model systems both with and without noise.
Finally, we investigate methods to leverage historical data in a quadratic
manner through the use of a novel cobias--covariance relationship, which
naturally proposes a mechanism for batching through an eigendecomposition
strategy. When our difference-based method leveraging the cobias--covariance
relationship is utilized in a batched setting (with a quadratic estimator), we
outperform a number of canonical methods including BALD and Least Confidence.

TL;DR: PagedEviction是一种针对vLLM PagedAttention的细粒度KV缓存修剪策略，通过块级逐出算法提高内存效率，无需修改CUDA内核，在长上下文任务中实现更好的内存使用和准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着序列长度增加，KV缓存成为主要内存瓶颈，现有方法要么依赖注意力重要性评估，要么在不同vLLM页面间逐出token，效率有限

Method: 提出PagedEviction策略，专门为分页内存布局设计高效的块级逐出算法，与PagedAttention无缝集成且无需修改CUDA注意力内核

Result: 在Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct等模型和LongBench基准测试中，相比基线方法实现了更好的内存使用效率和准确性

Conclusion: PagedEviction有效解决了KV缓存的内存瓶颈问题，为长上下文LLM推理提供了高效的内存管理方案

Abstract: KV caching significantly improves the efficiency of Large Language Model
(LLM) inference by storing attention states from previously processed tokens,
enabling faster generation of subsequent tokens. However, as sequence length
increases, the KV cache quickly becomes a major memory bottleneck. To address
this, we propose PagedEviction, a novel fine-grained, structured KV cache
pruning strategy that enhances the memory efficiency of vLLM's PagedAttention.
Unlike existing approaches that rely on attention-based token importance or
evict tokens across different vLLM pages, PagedEviction introduces an efficient
block-wise eviction algorithm tailored for paged memory layouts. Our method
integrates seamlessly with PagedAttention without requiring any modifications
to its CUDA attention kernels. We evaluate PagedEviction across
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, and Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct models
on the LongBench benchmark suite, demonstrating improved memory usage with
better accuracy than baselines on long context tasks.

TL;DR: TiM模型通过引入精确的连续时间动力学方程，解决了生成模型中迭代扩散模型计算成本高与少步生成模型质量受限的矛盾，实现了任意步长的自适应生成，在保持较小参数量(865M)的同时超越了更大模型(SD3.5 8B、FLUX.1 12B)的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生成建模中的基本困境：迭代扩散模型计算成本高，而高效的少步替代方案受限于硬质量上限。这种生成步骤与输出质量之间的冲突源于限制性的训练目标。

Method: 引入精确的连续时间动力学方程，解析定义任意有限时间间隔内的状态转移，提出Transition Models (TiM)生成范式，可自适应任意步长转换。

Result: TiM仅用865M参数就实现了最先进性能，在所有评估步数上都超越了SD3.5(8B)和FLUX.1(12B)等领先模型，并随着采样预算增加呈现单调质量改进，在4096x4096分辨率下也能提供卓越保真度。

Conclusion: TiM模型成功解决了生成步骤与质量之间的权衡问题，提供了一种既能高效生成又能通过增加步骤持续提升质量的统一解决方案，代表了生成建模的重要进展。

Abstract: A fundamental dilemma in generative modeling persists: iterative diffusion
models achieve outstanding fidelity, but at a significant computational cost,
while efficient few-step alternatives are constrained by a hard quality
ceiling. This conflict between generation steps and output quality arises from
restrictive training objectives that focus exclusively on either infinitesimal
dynamics (PF-ODEs) or direct endpoint prediction. We address this challenge by
introducing an exact, continuous-time dynamics equation that analytically
defines state transitions across any finite time interval. This leads to a
novel generative paradigm, Transition Models (TiM), which adapt to
arbitrary-step transitions, seamlessly traversing the generative trajectory
from single leaps to fine-grained refinement with more steps. Despite having
only 865M parameters, TiM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing
leading models such as SD3.5 (8B parameters) and FLUX.1 (12B parameters) across
all evaluated step counts. Importantly, unlike previous few-step generators,
TiM demonstrates monotonic quality improvement as the sampling budget
increases. Additionally, when employing our native-resolution strategy, TiM
delivers exceptional fidelity at resolutions up to 4096x4096.

TL;DR: IPA是一种特征感知投影框架，通过保留降维隐藏空间中的信息来改进LoRA方法，在语言和视觉基准测试中平均提升1.5-2.3个准确率点，且仅需一半可训练参数即可达到完整LoRA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA的降维投影是随机初始化和数据无关的，丢弃了潜在有用信息，且该投影在训练中变化很小，成为性能瓶颈。

Method: 提出IPA框架，在线性情况下使用近似主成分分析的算法，通过特征感知投影明确保留降维隐藏空间中的信息，实现高效投影器预训练。

Result: 在语言和视觉基准测试中，IPA一致优于LoRA和DoRA，常识推理平均准确率提高1.5点，VTAB-1k提高2.3点，冻结投影时仅需一半参数即可匹配完整LoRA性能。

Conclusion: IPA通过信息保留的特征感知投影有效解决了LoRA的随机压缩瓶颈问题，在参数效率和性能方面都有显著提升。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, reduce
adaptation cost by injecting low-rank updates into pretrained weights. However,
LoRA's down-projection is randomly initialized and data-agnostic, discarding
potentially useful information. Prior analyses show that this projection
changes little during training, while the up-projection carries most of the
adaptation, making the random input compression a performance bottleneck. We
propose IPA, a feature-aware projection framework that explicitly preserves
information in the reduced hidden space. In the linear case, we instantiate IPA
with algorithms approximating top principal components, enabling efficient
projector pretraining with negligible inference overhead. Across language and
vision benchmarks, IPA consistently improves over LoRA and DoRA, achieving on
average 1.5 points higher accuracy on commonsense reasoning and 2.3 points on
VTAB-1k, while matching full LoRA performance with roughly half the trainable
parameters when the projection is frozen.

Conclusion: HCL能够发现可解释的机制级因果异质性，在科学发现领域具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Understanding causal heterogeneity is essential for scientific discovery in
domains such as biology and medicine. However, existing methods lack causal
awareness, with insufficient modeling of heterogeneity, confounding, and
observational constraints, leading to poor interpretability and difficulty
distinguishing true causal heterogeneity from spurious associations. We propose
an unsupervised framework, HCL (Interpretable Causal Mechanism-Aware Clustering
with Adaptive Heterogeneous Causal Structure Learning), that jointly infers
latent clusters and their associated causal structures from mixed-type
observational data without requiring temporal ordering, environment labels,
interventions or other prior knowledge. HCL relaxes the homogeneity and
sufficiency assumptions by introducing an equivalent representation that
encodes both structural heterogeneity and confounding. It further develops a
bi-directional iterative strategy to alternately refine causal clustering and
structure learning, along with a self-supervised regularization that balance
cross-cluster universality and specificity. Together, these components enable
convergence toward interpretable, heterogeneous causal patterns. Theoretically,
we show identifiability of heterogeneous causal structures under mild
conditions. Empirically, HCL achieves superior performance in both clustering
and structure learning tasks, and recovers biologically meaningful mechanisms
in real-world single-cell perturbation data, demonstrating its utility for
discovering interpretable, mechanism-level causal heterogeneity.

Conclusion: 论文为后训练提供了统一的理论框架，HPT算法能够合理结合示范数据利用和稳定探索，不伤宽已学习的推理模式。

Abstract: Two major sources of training data exist for post-training modern language
models: online (model-generated rollouts) data, and offline (human or
other-model demonstrations) data. These two types of data are typically used by
approaches like Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
respectively. In this paper, we show that these approaches are not in
contradiction, but are instances of a single optimization process. We derive a
Unified Policy Gradient Estimator, and present the calculations of a wide
spectrum of post-training approaches as the gradient of a common objective
under different data distribution assumptions and various bias-variance
tradeoffs. The gradient estimator is constructed with four interchangeable
parts: stabilization mask, reference policy denominator, advantage estimate,
and likelihood gradient. Motivated by our theoretical findings, we propose
Hybrid Post-Training (HPT), an algorithm that dynamically selects different
training signals. HPT is designed to yield both effective exploitation of
demonstration and stable exploration without sacrificing learned reasoning
patterns. We provide extensive experiments and ablation studies to verify the
effectiveness of our unified theoretical framework and HPT. Across six
mathematical reasoning benchmarks and two out-of-distribution suites, HPT
consistently surpasses strong baselines across models of varying scales and
families.

Conclusion: 状态空间模型视角为ESN提供了统一的理论框架，连接了储备池计算与经典系统理论，为ESN的设计和分析提供了更严格的基础。

Abstract: Echo State Networks (ESNs) are typically presented as efficient,
readout-trained recurrent models, yet their dynamics and design are often
guided by heuristics rather than first principles. We recast ESNs explicitly as
state-space models (SSMs), providing a unified systems-theoretic account that
links reservoir computing with classical identification and modern kernelized
SSMs. First, we show that the echo-state property is an instance of
input-to-state stability for a contractive nonlinear SSM and derive verifiable
conditions in terms of leak, spectral scaling, and activation Lipschitz
constants. Second, we develop two complementary mappings: (i) small-signal
linearizations that yield locally valid LTI SSMs with interpretable poles and
memory horizons; and (ii) lifted/Koopman random-feature expansions that render
the ESN a linear SSM in an augmented state, enabling transfer-function and
convolutional-kernel analyses. This perspective yields frequency-domain
characterizations of memory spectra and clarifies when ESNs emulate structured
SSM kernels. Third, we cast teacher forcing as state estimation and propose
Kalman/EKF-assisted readout learning, together with EM for hyperparameters
(leak, spectral radius, process/measurement noise) and a hybrid subspace
procedure for spectral shaping under contraction constraints.

Abstract: Recent advancements in tabular deep learning have demonstrated exceptional
practical performance, yet the field often lacks a clear understanding of why
these techniques actually succeed. To address this gap, our paper highlights
the importance of the concept of data uncertainty for explaining the
effectiveness of the recent tabular DL methods. In particular, we reveal that
the success of many beneficial design choices in tabular DL, such as numerical
feature embeddings, retrieval-augmented models and advanced ensembling
strategies, can be largely attributed to their implicit mechanisms for managing
high data uncertainty. By dissecting these mechanisms, we provide a unifying
understanding of the recent performance improvements. Furthermore, the insights
derived from this data-uncertainty perspective directly allowed us to develop
more effective numerical feature embeddings as an immediate practical outcome
of our analysis. Overall, our work paves the way to foundational understanding
of the benefits introduced by modern tabular methods that results in the
concrete advancements of existing techniques and outlines future research
directions for tabular DL.

Abstract: Recent AI work trends towards incorporating human-centric objectives, with
the explicit goal of aligning AI models to personal preferences and societal
values. Using standard preference elicitation methods, researchers and
practitioners build models of human decisions and judgments, which are then
used to align AI behavior with that of humans. However, models commonly used in
such elicitation processes often do not capture the true cognitive processes of
human decision making, such as when people use heuristics to simplify
information associated with a decision problem. As a result, models learned
from people's decisions often do not align with their cognitive processes, and
can not be used to validate the learning framework for generalization to other
decision-making tasks. To address this limitation, we take an axiomatic
approach to learning cognitively faithful decision processes from pairwise
comparisons. Building on the vast literature characterizing the cognitive
processes that contribute to human decision-making, and recent work
characterizing such processes in pairwise comparison tasks, we define a class
of models in which individual features are first processed and compared across
alternatives, and then the processed features are then aggregated via a fixed
rule, such as the Bradley-Terry rule. This structured processing of information
ensures such models are realistic and feasible candidates to represent
underlying human decision-making processes. We demonstrate the efficacy of this
modeling approach in learning interpretable models of human decision making in
a kidney allocation task, and show that our proposed models match or surpass

TL;DR: ChronoGraph是一个基于真实微服务系统构建的图结构多变量时间序列预测数据集，包含服务性能指标和依赖关系，提供异常检测标签和基准测试结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准数据集主要来自工业控制系统或交通空气质量领域，缺乏结合多变量时间序列、明确依赖图和真实异常标签的微服务系统数据集。

Method: 从真实生产微服务构建数据集，节点为服务（含CPU、内存、网络等性能指标），有向边表示服务间依赖关系，并提供专家标注的异常事件窗口。

Result: 提供了涵盖预测模型、预训练时间序列基础模型和标准异常检测器的基准结果，展示了在微服务系统中进行结构感知预测和事件感知评估的可行性。

Conclusion: ChronoGraph为研究微服务系统中的结构感知预测和事件感知评估提供了一个现实的基准数据集，填补了现有数据集的空白。

Abstract: We present ChronoGraph, a graph-structured multivariate time series
forecasting dataset built from real-world production microservices. Each node
is a service that emits a multivariate stream of system-level performance
metrics, capturing CPU, memory, and network usage patterns, while directed
edges encode dependencies between services. The primary task is forecasting
future values of these signals at the service level. In addition, ChronoGraph
provides expert-annotated incident windows as anomaly labels, enabling
evaluation of anomaly detection methods and assessment of forecast robustness
during operational disruptions. Compared to existing benchmarks from industrial
control systems or traffic and air-quality domains, ChronoGraph uniquely
combines (i) multivariate time series, (ii) an explicit, machine-readable
dependency graph, and (iii) anomaly labels aligned with real incidents. We
report baseline results spanning forecasting models, pretrained time-series
foundation models, and standard anomaly detectors. ChronoGraph offers a
realistic benchmark for studying structure-aware forecasting and incident-aware
evaluation in microservice systems.

*Cedric Perret,The Anh Han,Elias Fernández Domingos,Theodor Cimpeanu,Simon T. Powers*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 这篇论文将信任形式化为重复游戏中的认知短接，通过观察到合作水平超过阈值后停止检查对方行动的策略。在检查成本较高的情况下，信任基础策略能够在许多社会困境中替代标准互惠策略，提高整体合作水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 游戏理论模型常常无法区分合作行为和信任，这使得很难量化信任和确定其在不同社会困境中的效果。研究者希望通过形式化信任来解决这一问题。

Method: 将信任形式化为重复游戏中的认知短接机制，定义了一种一旦观察到对方合作水平超过某个阈值就停止检查其行动的策略。在两人对称社会困境游戏空间中系统分析了这种信任基础策略的进化。

Result: 在检查行动的成本较高时（如实际世界情况），信任基础策略在许多社会困境中能够替代标准互惠策略（如以牙还牙）。信任的存在提高了群体的整体合作水平，尤其是在行动可能出现无意错误的情况下。这种效果甚至在存在利用信任的策略时也保持。

Conclusion: 信任恶知为个体带来了适应性好处，并为信任如何促进不同类型社会交互中的合作提供了形式化理论。这些发现对人类与人工智能代理之间的交互具有重要意义。

Abstract: Trust is often thought to increase cooperation. However, game-theoretic
models often fail to distinguish between cooperative behaviour and trust. This
makes it difficult to measure trust and determine its effect in different
social dilemmas. We address this here by formalising trust as a cognitive
shortcut in repeated games. This functions by avoiding checking a partner's
actions once a threshold level of cooperativeness has been observed. We
consider trust-based strategies that implement this heuristic, and
systematically analyse their evolution across the space of two-player symmetric
social dilemma games. We find that where it is costly to check whether another
agent's actions were cooperative, as is the case in many real-world settings,
then trust-based strategies can outcompete standard reciprocal strategies such
as Tit-for-Tat in many social dilemmas. Moreover, the presence of trust
increases the overall level of cooperation in the population, especially in
cases where agents can make unintentional errors in their actions. This occurs
even in the presence of strategies designed to build and then exploit trust.
Overall, our results demonstrate the individual adaptive benefit to an agent of
using a trust heuristic, and provide a formal theory for how trust can promote
cooperation in different types of social interaction. We discuss the
implications of this for interactions between humans and artificial
intelligence agents.

TL;DR: ACT框架自动寻找满足推荐系统约束条件的最小超参数调整集，通过离线成对评估和无偏数据找到解决方案，并能持续适应系统和用户行为变化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统需要在最大化主要目标的同时确保次要目标满足最低阈值（防护栏），但面对正交系统变化时手动调整超参数具有挑战性

Method: 引入自动化约束目标（ACT）框架，使用离线成对评估在无偏数据上寻找解决方案，并持续重新训练以适应系统和用户行为变化

Result: 通过实证研究证明了其有效性，并描述了在大规模生产环境中的部署情况

Conclusion: ACT框架能够有效解决推荐系统中多目标约束的自动化调整问题，适用于实际生产环境

Abstract: Recommender systems often must maximize a primary objective while ensuring
secondary ones satisfy minimum thresholds, or "guardrails." This is critical
for maintaining a consistent user experience and platform ecosystem, but
enforcing these guardrails despite orthogonal system changes is challenging and
often requires manual hyperparameter tuning. We introduce the Automated
Constraint Targeting (ACT) framework, which automatically finds the minimal set
of hyperparameter changes needed to satisfy these guardrails. ACT uses an
offline pairwise evaluation on unbiased data to find solutions and continuously
retrains to adapt to system and user behavior changes. We empirically
demonstrate its efficacy and describe its deployment in a large-scale
production environment.

TL;DR: 使用大语言模型估计位置偏巾，通过LLM-as-a-judge方法提升逆倾向概率评分的准确性，在保持NDCG@10的同时提高了加权NDCG@10绩2%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 定位偏巾影响推荐系统的准确性，传统的逆倾向概率评分(IPS)方法在复杂布局界面中偏向估计难以准确进行

Method: 提出使用大语言模型(LLM)作为判断器来估计位置偏巾的新方法，通过分析日志用户交互数据来获得更准确的倾向概率估计

Result: 方法能够稳定地估计不同分数段的偏向倾向，发现了Viator网格布局的行列效应，使用该方法训练的IPS重排模型在NDCG@10指标上与生产模型相当，加权NDCG@10提高了2%

Conclusion: LLM-as-a-judge方法为估计位置偏巾提供了一种成本效益更高的方案，能够有效减少偏巾对推荐系统的影响，并在离线实验中展现出显著改善

Abstract: Recommender and search systems commonly rely on Learning To Rank models
trained on logged user interactions to order items by predicted relevance.
However, such interaction data is often subject to position bias, as users are
more likely to click on items that appear higher in the ranking, regardless of
their actual relevance. As a result, newly trained models may inherit and
reinforce the biases of prior ranking models rather than genuinely improving
relevance. A standard approach to mitigate position bias is Inverse Propensity
Scoring (IPS), where the model's loss is weighted by the inverse of a
propensity function, an estimate of the probability that an item at a given
position is examined. However, accurate propensity estimation is challenging,
especially in interfaces with complex non-linear layouts. In this paper, we
propose a novel method for estimating position bias using Large Language Models
(LLMs) applied to logged user interaction data. This approach offers a
cost-effective alternative to online experimentation. Our experiments show that
propensities estimated with our LLM-as-a-judge approach are stable across score
buckets and reveal the row-column effects of Viator's grid layout that simpler
heuristics overlook. An IPS-weighted reranker trained with these propensities
matches the production model on standard NDCG@10 while improving weighted
NDCG@10 by roughly 2%. We will verify these offline gains in forthcoming
live-traffic experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM基于推荐系统中商品ID集成的挑战，实际商品目录包含数百万个商品ID，传统方法需要将商品分解为多个token，导致实时应用中的急剧性能瓶颈

Method: 提出简单但高效的新题训练和推理修改方法，支持单个token表示商品和单步解码，将商品ID作为一等公民直接集成到LLM中

Result: 在Amazon购物数据集上显示出推荐质量（Recall和NDCG）的改善，同时将推理效率提高5-14倍

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM基于推荐系统提供了一种不同于其他流行方法的效率视角，有望激发更多研究并为将ID集成到LLM中开启新方向

Abstract: Integrating product catalogs and user behavior into LLMs can enhance
recommendations with broad world knowledge, but the scale of real-world item
catalogs, often containing millions of discrete item identifiers (Item IDs),
poses a significant challenge. This contrasts with the smaller, tokenized text
vocabularies typically used in LLMs. The predominant view within the LLM-based
recommendation literature is that it is infeasible to treat item ids as a first
class citizen in the LLM and instead some sort of tokenization of an item into
multiple tokens is required. However, this creates a key practical bottleneck
in serving these models for real-time low-latency applications.
  Our paper challenges this predominant practice and integrates item ids as
first class citizens into the LLM. We provide simple, yet highly effective,
novel training and inference modifications that enable single-token
representations of items and single-step decoding. Our method shows
improvements in recommendation quality (Recall and NDCG) over existing
techniques on the Amazon shopping datasets while significantly improving
inference efficiency by 5x-14x. Our work offers an efficiency perspective
distinct from that of other popular approaches within LLM-based recommendation,
potentially inspiring further research and opening up a new direction for
integrating IDs into LLMs. Our code is available here

Conclusion: 基于LLM的标注方法能够产生更高质量的相关性指标，显著降低在线实验测量中的最小可检测效应，为搜索系统提供可扩展的自动化评估方案

Abstract: Relevance evaluation plays a crucial role in personalized search systems to
ensure that search results align with a user's queries and intent. While human
annotation is the traditional method for relevance evaluation, its high cost
and long turnaround time limit its scalability. In this work, we present our
approach at Pinterest Search to automate relevance evaluation for online
experiments using fine-tuned LLMs. We rigorously validate the alignment between
LLM-generated judgments and human annotations, demonstrating that LLMs can
provide reliable relevance measurement for experiments while greatly improving
the evaluation efficiency. Leveraging LLM-based labeling further unlocks the
opportunities to expand the query set, optimize sampling design, and
efficiently assess a wider range of search experiences at scale. This approach
leads to higher-quality relevance metrics and significantly reduces the Minimum
Detectable Effect (MDE) in online experiment measurements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强生成(RAG)系统虽能减少大语言模型的幻觉，但存在吸收和复现检索到的错误信息的漏洞，特别是在医疗这种高风险领域。

Method: 在医疗领域进行受控实验，变化检索文档类型(有益、有害、对投)和问题框架方式(一致、中立、不一致)，评估模型输出与真实答案的一致性。

Result: 对投性文档显著降低了模型输出的准确性，但当检索集中同时包含有益证据时，系统的稳健性可以得以保持。

Conclusion: 研究结果为高风险领域设计更安全的RAG系统提供了可操作的见解，强调了对检索安全保障措施的需求。

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems provide a method for factually
grounding the responses of a Large Language Model (LLM) by providing retrieved
evidence, or context, as support. Guided by this context, RAG systems can
reduce hallucinations and expand the ability of LLMs to accurately answer
questions outside the scope of their training data. Unfortunately, this design
introduces a critical vulnerability: LLMs may absorb and reproduce
misinformation present in retrieved evidence. This problem is magnified if
retrieved evidence contains adversarial material explicitly intended to
promulgate misinformation. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of RAG
robustness in the health domain and examines alignment between model outputs
and ground-truth answers. We focus on the health domain due to the potential
for harm caused by incorrect responses, as well as the availability of
evidence-based ground truth for many common health-related questions. We
conduct controlled experiments using common health questions, varying both the
type and composition of the retrieved documents (helpful, harmful, and
adversarial) as well as the framing of the question by the user (consistent,
neutral, and inconsistent). Our findings reveal that adversarial documents
substantially degrade alignment, but robustness can be preserved when helpful
evidence is also present in the retrieval pool. These findings offer actionable
insights for designing safer RAG systems in high-stakes domains by highlighting
the need for retrieval safeguards. To enable reproducibility and facilitate
future research, all experimental results are publicly available in our github
repository.

Result: 在三个基准测试中显著优于词汇检索和密集句子级检索基线方法，证明了内部表示选择的有效性

Conclusion: 为LLM内部表示选择提供了实证支持，展示了可扩展、无模式实体检索的实用解决方案

Abstract: We present NER Retriever, a zero-shot retrieval framework for ad-hoc Named
Entity Retrieval, a variant of Named Entity Recognition (NER), where the types
of interest are not provided in advance, and a user-defined type description is
used to retrieve documents mentioning entities of that type. Instead of relying
on fixed schemas or fine-tuned models, our method builds on internal
representations of large language models (LLMs) to embed both entity mentions
and user-provided open-ended type descriptions into a shared semantic space. We
show that internal representations, specifically the value vectors from
mid-layer transformer blocks, encode fine-grained type information more
effectively than commonly used top-layer embeddings. To refine these
representations, we train a lightweight contrastive projection network that
aligns type-compatible entities while separating unrelated types. The resulting
entity embeddings are compact, type-aware, and well-suited for nearest-neighbor
search. Evaluated on three benchmarks, NER Retriever significantly outperforms
both lexical and dense sentence-level retrieval baselines. Our findings provide
empirical support for representation selection within LLMs and demonstrate a
practical solution for scalable, schema-free entity retrieval. The NER
Retriever Codebase is publicly available at

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Technical-Embeddings, a novel framework designed
to optimize semantic retrieval in technical documentation, with applications in
both hardware and software development. Our approach addresses the challenges
of understanding and retrieving complex technical content by leveraging the
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). First, we enhance user queries by
generating expanded representations that better capture user intent and improve
dataset diversity, thereby enriching the fine-tuning process for embedding
models. Second, we apply summary extraction techniques to encode essential
contextual information, refining the representation of technical documents. To
further enhance retrieval performance, we fine-tune a bi-encoder BERT model
using soft prompting, incorporating separate learning parameters for queries
and document context to capture fine-grained semantic nuances. We evaluate our
approach on two public datasets, RAG-EDA and Rust-Docs-QA, demonstrating that
Technical-Embeddings significantly outperforms baseline models in both
precision and recall. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating
query expansion and contextual summarization to enhance information access and
comprehension in technical domains. This work advances the state of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, offering new avenues for
efficient and accurate technical document retrieval in engineering and product
development workflows.

Motivation: 随着用户兴趣的动态演变和互联网应用中多模态需求的增长，基于静态兴趣偏好的个性化内容生成策略难以满足实际应用需求。

Method: TIMGen模型联合学习时序依赖性和模态偏好，获得统一的兴趣表示，支持文本、图像、视频和音频等多模态特征的融合，并基于多模态偏好提供定制化内容。

Result: 该模型克服了基于静态偏好的个性化内容推荐方法的缺点，能够灵活动态地建模用户的多模态兴趣，更好地理解和捕捉用户的兴趣偏好。

Conclusion: TIMGen可扩展到电子商务、广告、在线教育和精准医疗等多种实际应用场景，为未来研究提供了见解。

Abstract: With the dynamic evolution of user interests and the increasing multimodal
demands in internet applications, personalized content generation strategies
based on static interest preferences struggle to meet practical application
requirements. The proposed TIMGen (Temporal Interest-driven Multimodal
Generation) model addresses this challenge by modeling the long-term temporal
evolution of users' interests and capturing dynamic interest representations
with strong temporal dependencies. This model also supports the fusion of
multimodal features, such as text, images, video, and audio, and delivers
customized content based on multimodal preferences. TIMGen jointly learns
temporal dependencies and modal preferences to obtain a unified interest
representation, which it then generates to meet users' personalized content
needs. TIMGen overcomes the shortcomings of personalized content recommendation
methods based on static preferences, enabling flexible and dynamic modeling of
users' multimodal interests, better understanding and capturing their interests
and preferences. It can be extended to a variety of practical application
scenarios, including e-commerce, advertising, online education, and precision
medicine, providing insights for future research.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel framework following an
upstream-downstream paradigm to construct user and item (Pin) embeddings from
diverse data sources, which are essential for Pinterest to deliver personalized
Pins and ads effectively. Our upstream models are trained on extensive data
sources featuring varied signals, utilizing complex architectures to capture
intricate relationships between users and Pins on Pinterest. To ensure
scalability of the upstream models, entity embeddings are learned, and
regularly refreshed, rather than real-time computation, allowing for
asynchronous interaction between the upstream and downstream models. These
embeddings are then integrated as input features in numerous downstream tasks,
including ad retrieval and ranking models for CTR and CVR predictions. We
demonstrate that our framework achieves notable performance improvements in
both offline and online settings across various downstream tasks. This
framework has been deployed in Pinterest's production ad ranking systems,
resulting in significant gains in online metrics.

Motivation: 传统的全局到局部检索范式由于局部匹配计算成本高，只能对少量检索结果进行重排序。新兴的高效局部特征搜索技术使得大规模详细检索成为可能，但需要与全局特征重排序相结合来提升性能。

Method: 提出局部到全局检索范式，使用高效的局部特征搜索进行初步检索，然后基于局部特征检索相似性动态计算全局特征进行重排序。利用多维缩放技术创建尊重局部相似性的嵌入表示。

Conclusion: 局部到全局检索范式通过结合高效的局部特征搜索和基于局部相似性的全局特征重排序，为图像检索系统提供了新的设计思路，显著提升了检索性能。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in image retrieval systems today is to search large
databases using global image features, and re-rank those initial results with
local image feature matching techniques. This design, dubbed global-to-local,
stems from the computational cost of local matching approaches, which can only
be afforded for a small number of retrieved images. However, emerging efficient
local feature search approaches have opened up new possibilities, in particular
enabling detailed retrieval at large scale, to find partial matches which are
often missed by global feature search. In parallel, global feature-based
re-ranking has shown promising results with high computational efficiency. In
this work, we leverage these building blocks to introduce a local-to-global
retrieval paradigm, where efficient local feature search meets effective global
feature re-ranking. Critically, we propose a re-ranking method where global
features are computed on-the-fly, based on the local feature retrieval
similarities. Such re-ranking-only global features leverage multidimensional
scaling techniques to create embeddings which respect the local similarities
obtained during search, enabling a significant re-ranking boost.
Experimentally, we demonstrate solid retrieval performance, setting new
state-of-the-art results on the Revisited Oxford and Paris datasets.

employs datasets formed by app users, developers or vendors. However, little is
known about the sources of these datasets in terms of platforms and the RE
activities that were researched with the help of the respective datasets.
[Aims] The goal of this paper is to investigate the state-of-the-art of the
datasets of mobile apps used in existing RE research. [Method] We carried out a
systematic mapping study by following the guidelines of Kitchenham et al.
[Results] Based on 43 selected papers, we found that Google Play and Apple App
Store provide the datasets for more than 90% of published research in RE for
mobile apps. We also found that the most investigated RE activities - based on
datasets, are requirements elicitation and requirements analysis. [Conclusions]
Our most important conclusions are: (1) there is a growth in the use of
datasets for RE research of mobile apps since 2012, (2) the RE knowledge for
mobile apps might be skewed due to the overuse of Google Play and Apple App
Store, (3) there are attempts to supplement reviews of apps from repositories
with other data sources, (4) there is a need to expand the alternative sources
and experiments with complimentary use of multiple sources, if the community
wants more generalizable results. Plus, it is expected to expand the research
on other RE activities, beyond elicitation and analysis.

TL;DR: 基于分层随机森林的APB交易错误自动诊断框架，在ICCAD 2025竞赛进入前测第一名，达到91.36%整体准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动检测APB交易错误在大型VCD文件中效率低且容易出错，需要自动化解决方案来提高硬件调试效率

Method: 使用分层随机森林架构，通过4个预训练二元分类器按序检测超出范围访问、地址污染和数据污染错误，优先处理地址相关故障

Result: 整体准确率91.36%，地址错误的精确率和召回率近似100%，数据错误表现稳健，在ICCAD 2025竞赛前测阶段获得第一名

Conclusion: 分层机器学习方法是EDA硬件调试中强大的自动化工具，为复杂SoC设计验证提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Functional verification and debugging are critical bottlenecks in modern
System-on-Chip (SoC) design, with manual detection of Advanced Peripheral Bus
(APB) transaction errors in large Value Change Dump (VCD) files being
inefficient and error-prone. Addressing the 2025 ICCAD Contest Problem D, this
study proposes an automated error diagnosis framework using a hierarchical
Random Forest-based architecture. The multi-stage error diagnosis employs four
pre-trained binary classifiers to sequentially detect Out-of-Range Access,
Address Corruption, and Data Corruption errors, prioritizing high-certainty
address-related faults before tackling complex data errors to enhance
efficiency. Experimental results show an overall accuracy of 91.36%, with
near-perfect precision and recall for address errors and robust performance for
data errors. Although the final results of the ICCAD 2025 CAD Contest are yet
to be announced as of the submission date, our team achieved first place in the
beta stage, highlighting the method's competitive strength. This research
validates the potential of hierarchical machine learning as a powerful
automated tool for hardware debugging in Electronic Design Automation (EDA).

### [239] [Parse Tree Tracking Through Time for Programming Process Analysis at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03668)
*Matt Rau,Chris Brown,John Edwards*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 开发了首个算法来追踪解析树节点随时间变化，并应用于学生编程过程数据分析，发现了代码删除率、注释恢复行为等新观察结果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统编程过程数据分析主要使用高层描述性统计，难以在上下文环境中分析行为（如学生在循环上花费的时间），因为无法自动追踪高层代码表示（如抽象语法树）随时间变化和不可解析状态

Method: 使用本文提出的两种算法来追踪解析树节点随时间变化，并为不可解析代码状态构建树表示，应用于2021年CS1课程的学生击键数据进行分析

Result: 发现了可规模化观察的新统计结果：条件语句和循环内外的代码删除率相似，三分之一的注释代码最终被恢复，学生在代码中跳转的频率可能不表示困难

Conclusion: 追踪解析树随时间变化的能力为理解学生编程的新维度打开了大门，包括代码结构开发的最佳实践、学生最困难的语法结构的量化测量、重构行为以及代码内注意力转移

Abstract: Background and Context: Programming process data can be utilized to
understand the processes students use to write computer programming
assignments. Keystroke- and line-level event logs have been used in the past in
various ways, primarily in high-level descriptive statistics (e.g., timings,
character deletion rate, etc). Analysis of behavior in context (e.g., how much
time students spend working on loops) has been cumbersome because of our
inability to automatically track high-level code representations, such as
abstract syntax trees, through time and unparseable states.
  Objective: Our study has two goals. The first is to design the first
algorithm that tracks parse tree nodes through time. Second, we utilize this
algorithm to perform a partial replication study of prior work that used manual
tracking of code representations, as well as other novel analyses of student
programming behavior that can now be done at scale.
  Method: We use two algorithms presented in this paper to track parse tree
nodes through time and construct tree representations for unparseable code
states. We apply these algorithms to a public keystroke data from student
coursework in a 2021 CS1 course and conduct analysis on the resulting parse
trees.
  Findings: We discover newly observable statistics at scale, including that
code is deleted at similar rates inside and outside of conditionals and loops,
a third of commented out code is eventually restored, and that frequency with
which students jump around in their code may not be indicative of struggle.
  Implications: The ability to track parse trees through time opens the door to
understanding new dimensions of student programming, such as best practices of
structural development of code over time, quantitative measurement of what
syntactic constructs students struggle most with, refactoring behavior, and
attention shifting within the code.

*Rodrigo Oliveira Zacarias,Rodrigo Pereira dos Santos,Patricia Lago*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了SECO-TransDX概念模型，从开发者体验角度系统化定义软件生态系统透明度，包含63个相关概念，通过德尔菲研究验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件生态系统中透明度对开发者体验至关重要但研究不足，现有研究承认透明度对信任、公平和参与的重要性，但缺乏系统化的概念框架。

Method: 基于先前研究构建概念模型，并通过学术界和工业界专家的德尔菲研究进行完善。

Result: 开发了SECO-TransDX模型，识别了63个相互关联的概念，包括条件因素、生态系统程序、工件和关系动态，这些因素影响开发者在交互过程中对透明度的感知和构建。

Conclusion: 该模型为研究者提供了未来研究和工具开发的基础，为实践者支持设计可信赖、以开发者为中心的平台，提高透明度并促进软件生态系统的长期参与。

Abstract: Software ecosystems (SECO) have become a dominant paradigm in the software
industry, enabling third-party developers to co-create value through
complementary components and services. While Developer Experience (DX) is
increasingly recognized as critical for sustainable SECO, transparency remains
an underexplored factor shaping how developers perceive and interact with
ecosystems. Existing studies acknowledge transparency as essential for trust,
fairness, and engagement, yet its relationship with DX has not been
systematically conceptualized. Hence, this work aims to advance the
understanding of transparency in SECO from a developer-centered perspective. To
this end, we propose SECO-TransDX (Transparency in Software Ecosystems from a
Developer Experience Perspective), a conceptual model that introduces the
notion of DX-driven transparency. The model identifies 63 interrelated
concepts, including conditioning factors, ecosystem procedures, artifacts, and
relational dynamics that influence how transparency is perceived and
constructed during developer interactions. SECO-TransDX was built upon prior
research and refined through a Delphi study with experts from academia and
industry. It offers a structured lens to examine how transparency mediates DX
across technical, social, and organizational layers. For researchers, it lays
the groundwork for future studies and tool development; for practitioners, it
supports the design of trustworthy, developer-centered platforms that improve
transparency and foster long-term engagement in SECO.

*Ziyou Jiang,Mingyang Li,Guowei Yang,Lin Shi,Qing Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: VulRTex是一个基于大语言模型推理能力的漏洞相关issue报告识别方法，利用富文本信息和历史数据构建推理数据库，在数据不平衡情况下表现优异，比最佳基线方法F1提升11.0%，时间成本降低2倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注文本描述，缺乏对issue报告中富文本信息的综合分析，安全从业者需要花费大量时间手动识别漏洞相关issue，时间差可能被攻击者利用。

Method: 首先利用LLM的推理能力构建漏洞推理数据库，然后检索相关案例生成推理指导，引导LLM对目标issue的富文本信息进行推理分析来识别漏洞。

Result: 在973,572个issue上的实验显示，VulRTex在识别漏洞相关issue和预测CWE-ID方面表现最佳，F1提升11.0%，AUPRC提升20.2%，Macro-F1提升10.5%，时间成本比基线推理方法降低2倍。成功识别了2024年GitHub issue中的30个新兴漏洞，其中11个获得了CVE-ID分配。

Conclusion: VulRTex通过有效利用富文本信息和LLM推理能力，显著提升了漏洞相关issue的识别性能，具有实际应用价值，能够帮助安全从业者更高效地发现软件漏洞。

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities exist in open-source software (OSS), and the
developers who discover these vulnerabilities may submit issue reports (IRs) to
describe their details. Security practitioners need to spend a lot of time
manually identifying vulnerability-related IRs from the community, and the time
gap may be exploited by attackers to harm the system. Previously, researchers
have proposed automatic approaches to facilitate identifying these
vulnerability-related IRs, but these works focus on textual descriptions but
lack the comprehensive analysis of IR's rich-text information. In this paper,
we propose VulRTex, a reasoning-guided approach to identify
vulnerability-related IRs with their rich-text information. In particular,
VulRTex first utilizes the reasoning ability of the Large Language Model (LLM)
to prepare the Vulnerability Reasoning Database with historical IRs. Then, it
retrieves the relevant cases from the prepared reasoning database to generate
reasoning guidance, which guides LLM to identify vulnerabilities by reasoning
analysis on target IRs' rich-text information. To evaluate the performance of
VulRTex, we conduct experiments on 973,572 IRs, and the results show that
VulRTex achieves the highest performance in identifying the
vulnerability-related IRs and predicting CWE-IDs when the dataset is
imbalanced, outperforming the best baseline with +11.0% F1, +20.2% AUPRC, and
+10.5% Macro-F1, and 2x lower time cost than baseline reasoning approaches.
Furthermore, VulRTex has been applied to identify 30 emerging vulnerabilities
across 10 representative OSS projects in 2024's GitHub IRs, and 11 of them are
successfully assigned CVE-IDs, which illustrates VulRTex's practicality.

TL;DR: 对12种漏洞影响版本识别工具的综合实证研究表明，现有工具准确率不超过45%，存在根本性局限，需要新的方法突破。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 漏洞影响版本识别对补丁和风险管理至关重要，但现有工具在真实环境中的有效性不明确，评估范围有限且方法过时。

Method: 构建包含1,128个真实C/C++漏洞的高质量基准，从四个维度系统评估12种代表性工具：漏洞和版本级别的有效性、误报漏报根因、对补丁特性的敏感性、集成潜力。

Result: 所有工具准确率均不超过45%，主要挑战来自启发式依赖、有限语义推理和僵化匹配逻辑。集成策略最多可提升10.1%但总体准确率仍低于60%。

Conclusion: 现有方法存在根本性局限，需要全新的技术路线。研究为工具开发、组合策略和未来研究提供了可操作的见解，并发布了复现代码和基准数据集。

Abstract: Identifying which software versions are affected by a vulnerability is
critical for patching, risk mitigation.Despite a growing body of tools, their
real-world effectiveness remains unclear due to narrow evaluation scopes often
limited to early SZZ variants, outdated techniques, and small or
coarse-graineddatasets. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive
empirical study of vulnerability affected versions identification. We curate a
high quality benchmark of 1,128 real-world C/C++ vulnerabilities and
systematically evaluate 12 representative tools from both tracing and matching
paradigms across four dimensions: effectiveness at both vulnerability and
version levels, root causes of false positives and negatives, sensitivity to
patch characteristics, and ensemble potential. Our findings reveal fundamental
limitations: no tool exceeds 45.0% accuracy, with key challenges stemming from
heuristic dependence, limited semantic reasoning, and rigid matching logic.
Patch structures such as add-only and cross-file changes further hinder
performance. Although ensemble strategies can improve results by up to 10.1%,
overall accuracy remains below 60.0%, highlighting the need for fundamentally
new approaches. Moreover, our study offers actionable insights to guide tool
development, combination strategies, and future research in this critical area.
Finally, we release the replicated code and benchmark on our website to
encourage future contributions.outdated techniques, and small or coarse grained
datasets.

### [243] [Analyzing Variations in Dependency Distributions Due to Code Smell Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03896)
*Zushuai Zhang,Elliott Wen,Ewan Tempero*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 代码味道之间的相互作用会显著增加模块间的依赖关系，影响软件维护复杂性和成本，应优先处理相互作用的味道组合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模块间依赖关系会导致维护复杂性和成本增加，需要理解代码味道相互作用如何影响依赖关系的分布。

Method: 对116个开源Java系统进行依赖分析，量化代码味道相互作用的影响，对比味道之间以及味道与非味道之间的作用。

Result: 味道对之间相互作用会导致某些依赖关系增加而另一些减少，但总体依赖关系增加。例如Feature Envy方法与Data Class的依赖关系数量是非Feature Envy方法的7倍（从1个增至7个）。

Conclusion: 开发者应优先处理相互作用的代码味道，而非单独存在的味道，以减少模块间依赖关系。

Abstract: The existence of dependencies between modules, such as classes, can mean that
changing a module triggers ripple effects that make maintenance complex and
costly, so the advice is to minimize dependencies between modules. It is
therefore important to understand the circumstances that can lead to increased
dependencies. Recent studies suggest that code smells, which are
characteristics of code that indicate potential design issues, may interact in
ways that increase dependencies between modules. In this study, we aim to
confirm previous observations and investigate whether and how the distribution
of static dependencies changes in the presence of code smell interactions. We
conducted a dependency analysis on 116 open-source Java systems to quantify the
interactions, comparing interactions among code smells and interactions between
code smells and non-code smells. Our results suggest that while interactions
between code smell pairs are associated with increases in certain dependencies
and decreases in others, overall, they are associated with an increase in total
dependencies. For example, the median number of dependencies between Feature
Envy methods and Data Classes is seven times as many as when the methods are
non-Feature Envy methods, increasing from 1 to 7. This implies that developers
should prioritize addressing code smells that interact with each other, rather
than code smells that exist only in isolation.

### [244] [The Auth Shim: A Lightweight Architectural Pattern for Integrating Enterprise SSO with Standalone Open-Source Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03900)
*Yuvraj Agrawal*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出了Auth Shim架构模式，通过外部代理服务解决开源软件缺乏企业级身份验证协议支持的问题，实现OSS工具与企业SSO生态系统的安全集成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业广泛采用开源软件，但许多独立工具缺乏对SAML、OIDC等企业级身份验证协议的原生支持，导致安全集成缺口，阻碍了开源创新在企业环境中的应用。

Method: 提出Auth Shim轻量级架构模式，作为外部代理服务充当兼容层，将企业身份提供商(IdP)的请求转换为目标应用程序的原生会话管理机制。目标应用需要提供安全的程序化管理API。

Result: 通过在Adobe的案例研究中实施该模式，成功将流行的OSS BI工具与Okta SAML集成，实现了基于IAM组映射的自动化RBAC，消除了手动用户配置。

Conclusion: Auth Shim模式提供了一个可重用、安全且经济高效的蓝图，使组织能够在保持安全治理的同时，将任何独立OSS工具集成到企业SSO生态系统中。

Abstract: Open-source software OSS is widely adopted in enterprise settings, but
standalone tools often lack native support for protocols like SAML or OIDC,
creating a critical security integration gap. This paper introduces and
formalizes the Auth Shim, a lightweight architectural pattern designed to solve
this problem. The Auth Shim is a minimal, external proxy service that acts as a
compatibility layer, translating requests from an enterprise Identity Provider
IdP into the native session management mechanism of a target application. A key
prerequisite for this pattern is that the target application must expose a
programmatic, secure administrative API. We present a case study of the
pattern's implementation at Adobe to integrate a popular OSS BI tool with Okta
SAML, which enabled automated Role-Based Access Control RBAC via IAM group
mapping and eliminated manual user provisioning. By defining its components,
interactions, and production deployment considerations, this paper provides a
reusable, secure, and cost-effective blueprint for integrating any standalone
OSS tool into an enterprise SSO ecosystem, thereby enabling organizations to
embrace open-source innovation without compromising on security governance.

TL;DR: RepoDebug是一个多任务、多语言的仓库级代码调试数据集，包含22种错误子类型、8种编程语言和3种调试任务，用于评估LLM在复杂仓库级调试场景中的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有调试数据集主要关注函数级代码修复，忽略了更复杂和现实的仓库级场景，导致对LLM在仓库级调试中面临的挑战理解不完整。

Method: 构建RepoDebug数据集，包含22种错误子类型、支持8种常用编程语言和3种调试任务，并在10个LLM上进行评估实验。

Result: Claude 3.5 Sonnet表现最佳，但在仓库级调试中仍然表现不佳，表明当前LLM在此类复杂场景中仍面临重大挑战。

Conclusion: 仓库级代码调试是一个具有挑战性的任务，现有LLM在此领域仍有很大改进空间，RepoDebug数据集为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited significant proficiency in code
debugging, especially in automatic program repair, which may substantially
reduce the time consumption of developers and enhance their efficiency.
Significant advancements in debugging datasets have been made to promote the
development of code debugging. However, these datasets primarily focus on
assessing the LLM's function-level code repair capabilities, neglecting the
more complex and realistic repository-level scenarios, which leads to an
incomplete understanding of the LLM's challenges in repository-level debugging.
While several repository-level datasets have been proposed, they often suffer
from limitations such as limited diversity of tasks, languages, and error
types. To mitigate this challenge, this paper introduces RepoDebug, a
multi-task and multi-language repository-level code debugging dataset with 22
subtypes of errors that supports 8 commonly used programming languages and 3
debugging tasks. Furthermore, we conduct evaluation experiments on 10 LLMs,
where Claude 3.5 Sonnect, the best-performing model, still cannot perform well
in repository-level debugging.

Conclusion: 现有检测工具能力与真实Python包安全问题的识别需求存在显著差距，需要未来在该领域的技术进步。

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving software development landscape, Python stands out for
its simplicity, versatility, and extensive ecosystem. Python packages, as units
of organization, reusability, and distribution, have become a pressing concern,
highlighted by the considerable number of vulnerability reports. As a scripting
language, Python often cooperates with other languages for performance or
interoperability. This adds complexity to the vulnerabilities inherent to
Python packages, and the effectiveness of current vulnerability detection tools
remains underexplored. This paper addresses these gaps by introducing PyVul,
the first comprehensive benchmark suite of Python-package vulnerabilities.
PyVul includes 1,157 publicly reported, developer-verified vulnerabilities,
each linked to its affected packages. To accommodate diverse detection
techniques, it provides annotations at both commit and function levels. An
LLM-assisted data cleansing method is incorporated to improve label accuracy,
achieving 100% commit-level and 94% function-level accuracy, establishing PyVul
as the most precise large-scale Python vulnerability benchmark. We further
carry out a distribution analysis of PyVul, which demonstrates that
vulnerabilities in Python packages involve multiple programming languages and
exhibit a wide variety of types. Moreover, our analysis reveals that
multi-lingual Python packages are potentially more susceptible to
vulnerabilities. Evaluation of state-of-the-art detectors using this benchmark
reveals a significant discrepancy between the capabilities of existing tools
and the demands of effectively identifying real-world security issues in Python
packages. Additionally, we conduct an empirical review of the top-ranked CWEs
observed in Python packages, to diagnose the fine-grained limitations of
current detection tools and highlight the necessity for future advancements in
the field.

TL;DR: FaaSGuard是一个针对开源无服务器环境的统一DevSecOps管道，通过在开发生命周期的各个阶段嵌入轻量级安全检查，有效检测和防止关键漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无服务器计算虽然简化了基础设施管理，但其短暂执行和细粒度可扩展性等特性带来了独特的安全挑战，特别是在OpenFaaS等开源平台中。现有方法通常只解决DevSecOps生命周期的孤立阶段，缺乏集成的全面安全策略。

Method: 提出了FaaSGuard，一个专门为开源无服务器环境设计的统一DevSecOps管道。它系统地在开发生命周期的每个阶段（规划、编码、构建、部署和监控）嵌入轻量级、故障关闭的安全检查，有效应对注入攻击、硬编码密钥和资源耗尽等威胁。

Result: 通过对来自公共GitHub仓库的20个真实世界无服务器函数进行案例研究验证，结果表明FaaSGuard能有效检测和防止关键漏洞，表现出高精度（95%）和高召回率（91%），且不会显著干扰现有的CI/CD实践。

Conclusion: FaaSGuard为开源无服务器环境提供了一个有效的集成安全解决方案，能够在保持开发效率的同时显著提升安全性。

Abstract: Serverless computing significantly alters software development by abstracting
infrastructure management and enabling rapid, modular, event-driven
deployments. Despite its benefits, the distinct characteristics of serverless
functions, such as ephemeral execution and fine-grained scalability, pose
unique security challenges, particularly in open-source platforms like
OpenFaaS. Existing approaches typically address isolated phases of the
DevSecOps lifecycle, lacking an integrated and comprehensive security strategy.
To bridge this gap, we propose FaaSGuard, a unified DevSecOps pipeline
explicitly designed for open-source serverless environments. FaaSGuard
systematically embeds lightweight, fail-closed security checks into every stage
of the development lifecycle-planning, coding, building, deployment, and
monitoring-effectively addressing threats such as injection attacks, hard-coded
secrets, and resource exhaustion. We validate our approach empirically through
a case study involving 20 real-world serverless functions from public GitHub
repositories. Results indicate that FaaSGuard effectively detects and prevents
critical vulnerabilities, demonstrating high precision (95%) and recall (91%)
without significant disruption to established CI/CD practices.

Abstract: Blood donation is a critical component of healthcare, yet locating suitable
donors in emergencies often presents significant challenges. This paper
presents the design and development of a Blood Donation Web Platform, a
web-based system that connects patients, donors, and administrators within a
centralized digital space. The platform allows interested donors to register
their personal information, including blood group, contact details, and
availability. Patients can search for donors based on blood group and location,
and the system provides a list of nearby donors who are ready to donate. The
platform design was guided by use case, database, class, and sequence diagrams
to ensure a well-structured and efficient system architecture. Modern web
technologies, including PHP (Laravel framework), HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and
MySQL, supported by XAMPP and Visual Studio Code, were employed to implement a
dynamic, interactive, and user-friendly platform. By streamlining donor
refgistration, blood requests, and communication, the proposed system reduces
delays and complexities in emergencies, improving timely accessibility of blood
and enhancing overall efficiency in blood donation services.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 本文提出两种结合剪枝和量化的深度网络压缩方法，在保持模型准确性的同时提高压缩效率，适用于资源受限设备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在资源受限设备上部署面临挑战，需要减少计算和内存需求。单独使用剪枝或量化方法有限，结合两者可以获得更好的压缩效果。

Method: 提出两种方法：1）训练过程中同时进行基于相似性的滤波器剪枝和APoT量化；2）先剪枝移除次要参数，然后对剪枝后模型进行低比特量化。

Result: 实验结果显示，提出的方法能够实现有效的模型压缩，准确性损失最小，适合在计算资源有限的设备上部署。

Conclusion: 通过结合剪枝和量化技术，本文方法能够在保持模型性能的前提下显著提高压缩效果，为深度网络在资源受限环境中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved significant advances in a wide
range of applications. However, their deployment on resource-constrained
devices remains a challenge due to the large number of layers and parameters,
which result in considerable computational and memory demands. To address this
issue, pruning and quantization are two widely used compression techniques,
commonly applied individually in most studies to reduce model size and enhance
processing speed. Nevertheless, combining these two techniques can yield even
greater compression benefits. Effectively integrating pruning and quantization
to harness their complementary advantages poses a challenging task, primarily
due to their potential impact on model accuracy and the complexity of jointly
optimizing both processes. In this paper, we propose two approaches that
integrate similarity-based filter pruning with Adaptive Power-of-Two (APoT)
quantization to achieve higher compression efficiency while preserving model
accuracy. In the first approach, pruning and quantization are applied
simultaneously during training. In the second approach, pruning is performed
first to remove less important parameters, followed by quantization of the
pruned model using low-bit representations. Experimental results demonstrate
that our proposed approaches achieve effective model compression with minimal
accuracy degradation, making them well-suited for deployment on devices with
limited computational resources.
