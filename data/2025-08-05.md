Abstract: Masked Face Recognition (MFR) is an increasingly important area in biometric
recognition technologies, especially with the widespread use of masks as a
result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This development has created new challenges
for facial recognition systems due to the partial concealment of basic facial
features. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the latest

which have played a pivotal role in improving the accuracy of covering face
recognition. The paper discusses the most prominent challenges, which include
changes in lighting, different facial positions, partial concealment, and the
impact of mask types on the performance of systems. It also reviews advanced
technologies developed to overcome these challenges, including data enhancement
using artificial databases and multimedia methods to improve the ability of
systems to generalize. In addition, the paper highlights advance in deep
network design, feature extraction techniques, evaluation criteria, and data
sets used in this area. Moreover, it reviews the various applications of masked
face recognition in the fields of security and medicine, highlighting the
growing importance of these systems in light of recurrent health crises and
increasing security threats. Finally, the paper focuses on future research

technologies to improve the performance of recognition systems in real-world
environments and expand their applications.

### [3] [HoneyImage: Verifiable, Harmless, and Stealthy Dataset Ownership Verification for Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00892)
*Zhihao Zhu,Jiale Han,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HoneyImage是一种新型图像数据集所有权验证方法，通过选择性修改少量困难样本嵌入可验证痕迹，实现高效验证且不影响数据完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像数据集常包含敏感或专有内容，现有验证方法在效果与数据完整性间存在权衡，需更可靠的机制保护数据所有权。

Method: HoneyImage选择性修改少量困难样本，嵌入不可察觉但可验证的痕迹，用于训练第三方模型时的所有权验证。

Result: 在四个基准数据集和多种模型架构上的实验表明，HoneyImage验证准确率高，对下游任务影响极小且痕迹不可察觉。

Conclusion: HoneyImage为数据所有者提供实用工具，保护图像数据集所有权，促进安全共享并释放数据驱动AI潜力。

Abstract: Image-based AI models are increasingly deployed across a wide range of
domains, including healthcare, security, and consumer applications. However,
many image datasets carry sensitive or proprietary content, raising critical
concerns about unauthorized data usage. Data owners therefore need reliable
mechanisms to verify whether their proprietary data has been misused to train
third-party models. Existing solutions, such as backdoor watermarking and
membership inference, face inherent trade-offs between verification
effectiveness and preservation of data integrity. In this work, we propose
HoneyImage, a novel method for dataset ownership verification in image
recognition models. HoneyImage selectively modifies a small number of hard
samples to embed imperceptible yet verifiable traces, enabling reliable
ownership verification while maintaining dataset integrity. Extensive
experiments across four benchmark datasets and multiple model architectures
show that HoneyImage consistently achieves strong verification accuracy with
minimal impact on downstream performance while maintaining imperceptible. The
proposed HoneyImage method could provide data owners with a practical mechanism
to protect ownership over valuable image datasets, encouraging safe sharing and
unlocking the full transformative potential of data-driven AI.

*Hoang Hai Nam Nguyen,Minh Tien Tran,Hoheok Kim,Ho Won Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PF-DiffSeg是一种基于扩散框架的单阶段生成模型，通过联合合成显微结构图像和分割掩码，显著提高了分割精度，尤其在少数类别上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决金属合金显微结构分割中因缺乏人工标注掩码（尤其是稀有或复杂形态）而导致的机器学习效果受限问题。

Method: 提出PF-DiffSeg，一种基于全局相分数控制的扩散框架，通过增强数据分布和强调少数类别，生成有效的显微结构图像和掩码。

Result: 在MetalDAM基准测试中，该方法显著提升了分割精度（尤其是少数类别），并优于两阶段扩散和GAN基线，同时减少了推理时间。

Conclusion: PF-DiffSeg为金属学应用提供了一种可扩展的数据增强解决方案，将生成和条件化集成到统一框架中。

Abstract: The effectiveness of machine learning in metallographic microstructure
segmentation is often constrained by the lack of human-annotated phase masks,
particularly for rare or compositionally complex morphologies within the metal
alloy. We introduce PF-DiffSeg, a phase-fraction controlled, one-stage
denoising diffusion framework that jointly synthesizes microstructure images
and their corresponding segmentation masks in a single generative trajectory to
further improve segmentation accuracy. By conditioning on global phase-fraction
vectors, augmented to represent real data distribution and emphasize minority
classes, our model generates compositionally valid and structurally coherent
microstructure image and mask samples that improve both data diversity and
training efficiency. Evaluated on the MetalDAM benchmark for additively
manufactured multiphase steel, our synthetic augmentation method yields notable
improvements in segmentation accuracy compared to standard augmentation
strategies especially in minority classes and further outperforms a two-stage
mask-guided diffusion and generative adversarial network (GAN) baselines, while
also reducing inference time compared to conventional approach. The method
integrates generation and conditioning into a unified framework, offering a
scalable solution for data augmentation in metallographic applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了结合自编码器和RNN、3D CNN等架构的混合深度学习模型在视频帧预测中的应用，结果显示3D CNN和ConvLSTM的混合模型效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 结合自编码器的特征提取能力和RNN、3D CNN等架构进行时序建模，并在不同数据集上评估。

Result: 混合模型表现良好，SSIM指标从0.69提升至0.82，3D CNN和ConvLSTM的组合效果最佳。

Conclusion: 3D CNN和ConvLSTM的混合模型在视频帧预测中表现最优，且灰度视频的真实数据最易预测。

Abstract: In recent years, advances in Artificial Intelligence have significantly
impacted computer science, particularly in the field of computer vision,
enabling solutions to complex problems such as video frame prediction. Video
frame prediction has critical applications in weather forecasting or autonomous
systems and can provide technical improvements, such as video compression and
streaming. Among Artificial Intelligence methods, Deep Learning has emerged as
highly effective for solving vision-related tasks, although current frame
prediction models still have room for enhancement. This paper evaluates several
hybrid deep learning approaches that combine the feature extraction
capabilities of autoencoders with temporal sequence modelling using Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs), 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs), and related
architectures. The proposed solutions were rigorously evaluated on three
datasets that differ in terms of synthetic versus real-world scenarios and
grayscale versus color imagery. Results demonstrate that the approaches perform
well, with SSIM metrics increasing from 0.69 to 0.82, indicating that hybrid
models utilizing 3DCNNs and ConvLSTMs are the most effective, and greyscale
videos with real data are the easiest to predict.

### [6] [TESPEC: Temporally-Enhanced Self-Supervised Pretraining for Event Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00913)
*Mohammad Mohammadi,Ziyi Wu,Igor Gilitschenski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TESPEC是一种自监督预训练框架，专为学习事件数据的时空信息设计，适用于循环模型，并在下游任务中取得领先结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法忽略事件数据的长期时间信息，限制了循环模型的性能。

Method: 提出TESPEC框架，利用掩码图像建模范式和新重建目标，通过事件累积生成伪灰度视频。

Result: 在目标检测、语义分割和深度估计等任务中取得最先进结果。

Conclusion: TESPEC通过有效利用长期事件序列，显著提升了循环模型的性能。

Abstract: Long-term temporal information is crucial for event-based perception tasks,
as raw events only encode pixel brightness changes. Recent works show that when
trained from scratch, recurrent models achieve better results than feedforward
models in these tasks. However, when leveraging self-supervised pre-trained
weights, feedforward models can outperform their recurrent counterparts.
Current self-supervised learning (SSL) methods for event-based pre-training
largely mimic RGB image-based approaches. They pre-train feedforward models on
raw events within a short time interval, ignoring the temporal information of
events. In this work, we introduce TESPEC, a self-supervised pre-training
framework tailored for learning spatio-temporal information. TESPEC is
well-suited for recurrent models, as it is the first framework to leverage long
event sequences during pre-training. TESPEC employs the masked image modeling
paradigm with a new reconstruction target. We design a novel method to
accumulate events into pseudo grayscale videos containing high-level semantic
information about the underlying scene, which is robust to sensor noise and
reduces motion blur. Reconstructing this target thus requires the model to
reason about long-term history of events. Extensive experiments demonstrate our
state-of-the-art results in downstream tasks, including object detection,
semantic segmentation, and monocular depth estimation. Project webpage:

Result: 识别准确率从29.1%提升至84.5%，效果显著。

Conclusion: 扩散增强技术在法医人脸识别中具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Face recognition systems experience severe performance degradation when
processing low-quality forensic evidence imagery. This paper presents an
evaluation of latent diffusion-based enhancement for improving face recognition
under forensically relevant degradations. Using a dataset of 3,000 individuals
from LFW with 24,000 recognition attempts, we implement the Flux.1 Kontext Dev
pipeline with Facezoom LoRA adaptation to test against seven degradation
categories, including compression artefacts, blur effects, and noise
contamination. Our approach demonstrates substantial improvements, increasing
overall recognition accuracy from 29.1% to 84.5% (55.4 percentage point
improvement, 95% CI: [54.1, 56.7]). Statistical analysis reveals significant
performance gains across all degradation types, with effect sizes exceeding
conventional thresholds for practical significance. These findings establish
the potential of sophisticated diffusion based enhancement in forensic face
recognition applications.

### [8] [Optimizing Vision-Language Consistency via Cross-Layer Regional Attention Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00945)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）在跨模态嵌入学习中面临注意力机制不匹配和性能不佳的问题。

Method: 提出CCRA方法，包括LPWCA（层-块级跨注意力）和PAI（渐进注意力整合），以细粒度协调区域-语义关联。

Result: 在十个视觉语言基准测试中，CCRA增强的LLaVA-v1.5-7B模型表现最优，仅增加3.55M参数。

Conclusion: CCRA通过区域聚焦和语义对齐的注意力模式，显著提升了模型性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) face challenges in effectively coordinating
diverse attention mechanisms for cross-modal embedding learning, leading to
mismatched attention and suboptimal performance. We propose Consistent
Cross-layer Regional Alignment (CCRA), which introduces Layer-Patch-wise Cross
Attention (LPWCA) to capture fine-grained regional-semantic correlations by
jointly weighting patch and layer-wise embedding, and Progressive Attention
Integration (PAI) that systematically coordinates LPWCA, layer-wise, and
patch-wise attention mechanisms in sequence. This progressive design ensures
consistency from semantic to regional levels while preventing attention drift
and maximizing individual attention benefits. Experimental results on ten
diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that our CCRA-enhanced
LLaVA-v1.5-7B model achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming all
baseline methods with only 3.55M additional parameters, while providing
enhanced interpretability through more regionally focused and semantically
aligned attention patterns.

Result: 结果表明，少量手动标注数据即可显著提升深度学习网络的性能。

Conclusion: 自动标注与少量手动标注结合，能快速适应深度学习网络到新场景，如从跑步机到自行车的转换。

Abstract: Infrared thermography is emerging as a powerful tool in sports medicine,
allowing assessment of thermal radiation during exercise and analysis of
anatomical regions of interest, such as the well-exposed calves. Building on
our previous advanced automatic annotation method, we aimed to transfer the
stereo- and multimodal-based labeling approach from treadmill running to
ergometer cycling. Therefore, the training of the semantic segmentation network
with automatic labels and fine-tuning on high-quality manually annotated images
has been examined and compared in different data set combinations. The results
indicate that fine-tuning with a small fraction of manual data is sufficient to
improve the overall performance of the deep neural network. Finally, combining
automatically generated labels with small manually annotated data sets
accelerates the adaptation of deep neural networks to new use cases, such as
the transition from treadmill to bicycle.

### [10] [ROVI: A VLM-LLM Re-Captioned Dataset for Open-Vocabulary Instance-Grounded Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01008)
*Cihang Peng,Qiming Hou,Zhong Ren,Kun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ROVI是一个高质量合成数据集，用于实例接地的文本到图像生成，通过标注100万张精选网络图像创建。其创新在于重新标注策略，结合VLM和LLM生成视觉描述，提升检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测数据集在图像质量、分辨率和类别数量上有限，ROVI旨在解决这些问题，提供更全面的实例接地能力。

Method: 采用重新标注策略，先由VLM生成视觉描述，再由LLM提取类别列表供OVD检测，确保全局提示与实例标注关联。

Result: ROVI在图像质量、分辨率和类别数量上优于现有数据集，基于ROVI训练的GLIGEN模型在实例接地准确性和美学质量上表现优异。

Conclusion: ROVI为文本到图像生成提供了高质量数据集和可复现流程，显著提升了实例接地能力。

Abstract: We present ROVI, a high-quality synthetic dataset for instance-grounded
text-to-image generation, created by labeling 1M curated web images. Our key
innovation is a strategy called re-captioning, focusing on the pre-detection
stage, where a VLM (Vision-Language Model) generates comprehensive visual
descriptions that are then processed by an LLM (Large Language Model) to
extract a flat list of potential categories for OVDs (Open-Vocabulary
Detectors) to detect. This approach yields a global prompt inherently linked to
instance annotations while capturing secondary visual elements humans typically
overlook. Evaluations show that ROVI exceeds existing detection datasets in
image quality and resolution while containing two orders of magnitude more
categories with an open-vocabulary nature. For demonstrative purposes, a
text-to-image model GLIGEN trained on ROVI significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art alternatives in instance grounding accuracy, prompt fidelity,
and aesthetic quality. Our dataset and reproducible pipeline are available at
https://github.com/CihangPeng/ROVI.

### [11] [AutoSIGHT: Automatic Eye Tracking-based System for Immediate Grading of Human experTise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01015)
*Byron Dowling,Jozef Probcin,Adam Czajka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoSIGHT系统通过眼动追踪数据自动评估人类在视觉任务中的专业水平，分类专家与非专家，并在虹膜PAD任务中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨是否可以通过眼动追踪特征自动评估人类在视觉任务中的专业水平，为动态人机协作提供支持。

Method: 基于眼动追踪数据提取特征，构建AutoSIGHT系统，采用ROC曲线评估性能。

Result: 在5秒评估窗口下，AUROC为0.751；30秒窗口下提升至0.8306。

Conclusion: AutoSIGHT验证了基于眼动追踪的专业评估可行性，为人机协作中的动态专家分配提供了新思路。

Abstract: Can we teach machines to assess the expertise of humans solving visual tasks
automatically based on eye tracking features? This paper proposes AutoSIGHT,
Automatic System for Immediate Grading of Human experTise, that classifies
expert and non-expert performers, and builds upon an ensemble of features
extracted from eye tracking data while the performers were solving a visual
task. Results on the task of iris Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) used for
this study show that with a small evaluation window of just 5 seconds,
AutoSIGHT achieves an average average Area Under the ROC curve performance of
0.751 in subject-disjoint train-test regime, indicating that such detection is
viable. Furthermore, when a larger evaluation window of up to 30 seconds is
available, the Area Under the ROC curve (AUROC) increases to 0.8306, indicating
the model is effectively leveraging more information at a cost of slightly
delayed decisions. This work opens new areas of research on how to incorporate
the automatic weighing of human and machine expertise into human-AI pairing
setups, which need to react dynamically to nonstationary expertise distribution
between the human and AI players (e.g. when the experts need to be replaced, or
the task at hand changes rapidly). Along with this paper, we offer the eye
tracking data used in this study collected from 6 experts and 53 non-experts
solving iris PAD visual task.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种增量式SfM方法，用于稀疏或部分重叠数据集中的3D重建，通过几何估计一致性和迭代优化提升重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全局SfM方法对噪声和缺失数据敏感的问题，提供更灵活的重建方案。

Method: 详细实现增量式SfM流程，关注几何估计一致性和通过捆绑调整的迭代优化。

Result: 在真实数据集上验证，通过重投影误差和相机轨迹一致性评估重建质量。

Conclusion: 增量式SfM是视觉结构化环境中稀疏3D重建的可靠方法。

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction from unstructured image collections is a key
requirement in applications such as robotics, mapping, and scene understanding.
While global Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques rely on full image
connectivity and can be sensitive to noise or missing data, incremental SfM
offers a more flexible alternative. By progressively incorporating new views
into the reconstruction, it enables the system to recover scene structure and
camera motion even in sparse or partially overlapping datasets. In this paper,
we present a detailed implementation of the incremental SfM pipeline, focusing
on the consistency of geometric estimation and the effect of iterative
refinement through bundle adjustment. We demonstrate the approach using a real
dataset and assess reconstruction quality through reprojection error and camera
trajectory coherence. The results support the practical utility of incremental
SfM as a reliable method for sparse 3D reconstruction in visually structured
environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图结构的新方法，用于3D CT扫描的多标签分类，解决了现有方法在长距离依赖建模和计算成本上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着CT扫描检查的增加，需要自动化方法辅助放射科医生处理工作负载，但现有方法在长距离依赖建模和计算成本上存在局限。

Method: 将CT扫描建模为结构化图，利用轴向切片三元组节点和谱域卷积增强多标签异常分类性能。

Result: 方法表现出强跨数据集泛化能力、竞争性性能以及对z轴平移的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的图结构方法在多标签分类任务中表现优异，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: With the increasing number of CT scan examinations, there is a need for
automated methods such as organ segmentation, anomaly detection and report
generation to assist radiologists in managing their increasing workload.
Multi-label classification of 3D CT scans remains a critical yet challenging
task due to the complex spatial relationships within volumetric data and the
variety of observed anomalies. Existing approaches based on 3D convolutional
networks have limited abilities to model long-range dependencies while Vision
Transformers suffer from high computational costs and often require extensive
pre-training on large-scale datasets from the same domain to achieve
competitive performance. In this work, we propose an alternative by introducing
a new graph-based approach that models CT scans as structured graphs,
leveraging axial slice triplets nodes processed through spectral domain
convolution to enhance multi-label anomaly classification performance. Our
method exhibits strong cross-dataset generalization, and competitive
performance while achieving robustness to z-axis translation. An ablation study
evaluates the contribution of each proposed component.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种统一的规避框架，通过教师模型学习版权数据集，再利用OOD数据集将任务相关但标识无关的知识转移到学生模型，显著提升了规避效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集所有权验证（DOV）方法在评估中依赖过于简化的规避攻击，导致虚假的安全感，需要更有效的规避方法。

Method: 利用教师模型学习版权数据集，通过OOD数据集转移任务相关但标识无关的知识，并结合视觉语言模型和大型语言模型优化转移集。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能消除所有版权标识，并在泛化性和有效性上显著优于现有九种规避攻击方法。

Conclusion: 揭示了当前DOV方法的关键漏洞，强调需要长期发展以提升实用性。

Abstract: Modern over-parameterized deep models are highly data-dependent, with large
scale general-purpose and domain-specific datasets serving as the bedrock for
rapid advancements. However, many datasets are proprietary or contain sensitive
information, making unrestricted model training problematic. In the open world
where data thefts cannot be fully prevented, Dataset Ownership Verification
(DOV) has emerged as a promising method to protect copyright by detecting
unauthorized model training and tracing illicit activities. Due to its
diversity and superior stealth, evading DOV is considered extremely
challenging. However, this paper identifies that previous studies have relied
on oversimplistic evasion attacks for evaluation, leading to a false sense of
security. We introduce a unified evasion framework, in which a teacher model
first learns from the copyright dataset and then transfers task-relevant yet
identifier-independent domain knowledge to a surrogate student using an
out-of-distribution (OOD) dataset as the intermediary. Leveraging
Vision-Language Models and Large Language Models, we curate the most
informative and reliable subsets from the OOD gallery set as the final transfer
set, and propose selectively transferring task-oriented knowledge to achieve a
better trade-off between generalization and evasion effectiveness. Experiments
across diverse datasets covering eleven DOV methods demonstrate our approach
simultaneously eliminates all copyright identifiers and significantly
outperforms nine state-of-the-art evasion attacks in both generalization and
effectiveness, with moderate computational overhead. As a proof of concept, we
reveal key vulnerabilities in current DOV methods, highlighting the need for
long-term development to enhance practicality.

Result: 模型性能因领域而异，Hunyuan-3D在航天器图像质量和小行星几何重建上表现最优。

Conclusion: DreamSat-2.0为领域依赖性3D重建提供了新基准，Hunyuan-3D表现突出。

Abstract: To enhance asteroid exploration and autonomous spacecraft navigation, we
introduce DreamSat-2.0, a pipeline that benchmarks three state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction models-Hunyuan-3D, Trellis-3D, and Ouroboros-3D-on custom
spacecraft and asteroid datasets. Our systematic analysis, using 2D perceptual
(image quality) and 3D geometric (shape accuracy) metrics, reveals that model
performance is domain-dependent. While models produce higher-quality images of
complex spacecraft, they achieve better geometric reconstructions for the
simpler forms of asteroids. New benchmarks are established, with Hunyuan-3D
achieving top perceptual scores on spacecraft but its best geometric accuracy
on asteroids, marking a significant advance over our prior work.

*Ryan Rabinowitz,Steve Cruz,Walter Scheirer,Terrance E. Boult*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的开放集识别方法COSTARR，通过利用训练中衰减的小权重特征，显著提升了识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放集识别方法依赖熟悉特征假设，忽略了衰减特征的作用，限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出衰减假设，结合熟悉特征和衰减特征，设计COSTARR方法，并进行概率解释和消融实验。

Result: COSTARR在多种预训练架构上表现优异，显著超越现有方法。

Conclusion: COSTARR通过利用衰减信息，推动了开放集识别领域的发展。

Abstract: Handling novelty remains a key challenge in visual recognition systems.
Existing open-set recognition (OSR) methods rely on the familiarity hypothesis,
detecting novelty by the absence of familiar features. We propose a novel
attenuation hypothesis: small weights learned during training attenuate
features and serve a dual role-differentiating known classes while discarding
information useful for distinguishing known from unknown classes. To leverage
this overlooked information, we present COSTARR, a novel approach that combines
both the requirement of familiar features and the lack of unfamiliar ones. We
provide a probabilistic interpretation of the COSTARR score, linking it to the
likelihood of correct classification and belonging in a known class. To
determine the individual contributions of the pre- and post-attenuated features
to COSTARR's performance, we conduct ablation studies that show both
pre-attenuated deep features and the underutilized post-attenuated Hadamard
product features are essential for improving OSR. Also, we evaluate COSTARR in
a large-scale setting using ImageNet2012-1K as known data and NINCO,
iNaturalist, OpenImage-O, and other datasets as unknowns, across multiple
modern pre-trained architectures (ViTs, ConvNeXts, and ResNet). The experiments
demonstrate that COSTARR generalizes effectively across various architectures
and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods by incorporating
previously discarded attenuation information, advancing open-set recognition
capabilities.

### [18] [Trans-Adapter: A Plug-and-Play Framework for Transparent Image Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01098)
*Yuekun Dai,Haitian Li,Shangchen Zhou,Chen Change Loy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Trans-Adapter的插件适配器，使基于扩散的图像修复模型能够直接处理透明图像，解决了现有方法在透明图像修复中的一致性和边缘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像修复方法仅适用于RGB图像，透明图像修复通常需要两阶段处理（修复+抠图），但会导致透明区域不一致和边缘锯齿问题。

Method: 提出Trans-Adapter插件，支持扩散模型直接处理RGBA图像，并兼容ControlNet实现可控编辑。

Result: 实验表明Trans-Adapter在透明图像修复中表现优异，并提出了新的评估指标LayerBench和alpha边缘质量度量。

Conclusion: Trans-Adapter为透明图像修复提供了高效且可控的解决方案，显著提升了透明边缘的质量和一致性。

Abstract: RGBA images, with the additional alpha channel, are crucial for any
application that needs blending, masking, or transparency effects, making them
more versatile than standard RGB images. Nevertheless, existing image
inpainting methods are designed exclusively for RGB images. Conventional
approaches to transparent image inpainting typically involve placing a
background underneath RGBA images and employing a two-stage process: image
inpainting followed by image matting. This pipeline, however, struggles to
preserve transparency consistency in edited regions, and matting can introduce
jagged edges along transparency boundaries. To address these challenges, we
propose Trans-Adapter, a plug-and-play adapter that enables diffusion-based
inpainting models to process transparent images directly. Trans-Adapter also
supports controllable editing via ControlNet and can be seamlessly integrated
into various community models. To evaluate our method, we introduce LayerBench,
along with a novel non-reference alpha edge quality evaluation metric for
assessing transparency edge quality. We conduct extensive experiments on
LayerBench to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预定义材料先验，限制了处理未知材料的能力。

Method: 引入密集几何引导，通过重建连续粒子轨迹提供时间丰富的运动约束。

Result: MASIV在几何精度、渲染质量和泛化能力上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: MASIV成功解决了材料无关系统识别的挑战，并表现出优越性能。

Abstract: System identification from videos aims to recover object geometry and
governing physical laws. Existing methods integrate differentiable rendering
with simulation but rely on predefined material priors, limiting their ability
to handle unknown ones. We introduce MASIV, the first vision-based framework
for material-agnostic system identification. Unlike existing approaches that
depend on hand-crafted constitutive laws, MASIV employs learnable neural
constitutive models, inferring object dynamics without assuming a
scene-specific material prior. However, the absence of full particle state
information imposes unique challenges, leading to unstable optimization and
physically implausible behaviors. To address this, we introduce dense geometric
guidance by reconstructing continuum particle trajectories, providing
temporally rich motion constraints beyond sparse visual cues. Comprehensive
experiments show that MASIV achieves state-of-the-art performance in geometric
accuracy, rendering quality, and generalization ability.

Result: EARL模型在多种编辑任务中表现优异，且训练数据需求较低。

Conclusion: EARL推动了自回归多模态模型在图像编辑领域的前沿，并开源了代码和数据。

Abstract: We explore three strategies to enhance performance on a wide range of image
editing tasks: supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), and
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. In order to study all these components in one
consistent framework, we adopt an autoregressive multimodal model that
processes textual and visual tokens in a unified manner. We find RL combined
with a large multi-modal LLM verifier to be the most effective of these
strategies. As a result, we release EARL: Editing with Autoregression and RL, a
strong RL-based image editing model that performs competitively on a diverse
range of edits compared to strong baselines, despite using much less training
data. Thus, EARL pushes the frontier of autoregressive multimodal models on
image editing. We release our code, training data, and trained models at

Result: UniEgoMotion在运动重建和生成任务中表现优异，首次实现了从单张第一人称图像生成运动。

Conclusion: UniEgoMotion为第一人称运动建模设定了新基准，拓展了相关应用的可能性。

Abstract: Egocentric human motion generation and forecasting with scene-context is
crucial for enhancing AR/VR experiences, improving human-robot interaction,
advancing assistive technologies, and enabling adaptive healthcare solutions by
accurately predicting and simulating movement from a first-person perspective.
However, existing methods primarily focus on third-person motion synthesis with
structured 3D scene contexts, limiting their effectiveness in real-world
egocentric settings where limited field of view, frequent occlusions, and
dynamic cameras hinder scene perception. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Egocentric Motion Generation and Egocentric Motion Forecasting, two novel tasks
that utilize first-person images for scene-aware motion synthesis without
relying on explicit 3D scene. We propose UniEgoMotion, a unified conditional
motion diffusion model with a novel head-centric motion representation tailored
for egocentric devices. UniEgoMotion's simple yet effective design supports
egocentric motion reconstruction, forecasting, and generation from first-person
visual inputs in a unified framework. Unlike previous works that overlook scene
semantics, our model effectively extracts image-based scene context to infer
plausible 3D motion. To facilitate training, we introduce EE4D-Motion, a
large-scale dataset derived from EgoExo4D, augmented with pseudo-ground-truth
3D motion annotations. UniEgoMotion achieves state-of-the-art performance in
egocentric motion reconstruction and is the first to generate motion from a
single egocentric image. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of
our unified framework, setting a new benchmark for egocentric motion modeling
and unlocking new possibilities for egocentric applications.

Motivation: 解决大规模数据、过拟合和类别不平衡等问题，特别是在脑MRI异常检测中。

Method: 结合深度强化学习与特征表示，处理标签稀缺和大规模数据，预处理包括归一化、颅骨剥离和配准。

Result: 在脑MRI数据集上AUROC达88.7%（像素级）和96.7%（图像级），在工业数据集上表现同样出色。

Conclusion: 该框架具有鲁棒性、泛化能力和高效性，适用于临床和工业应用。

Abstract: To develop a domain-agnostic, semi-supervised anomaly detection framework
that integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to address challenges such as
large-scale data, overfitting, and class imbalance, focusing on brain MRI
volumes. This retrospective study used publicly available brain MRI datasets
collected between 2005 and 2021. The IXI dataset provided 581 T1-weighted and
578 T2-weighted MRI volumes (from healthy subjects) for training, while the
BraTS 2021 dataset provided 251 volumes for validation and 1000 for testing
(unhealthy subjects with Glioblastomas). Preprocessing included normalization,
skull-stripping, and co-registering to a uniform voxel size. Experiments were
conducted on both T1- and T2-weighted modalities. Additional experiments and
ablation analyses were also carried out on the industrial datasets. The
proposed method integrates DRL with feature representations to handle label
scarcity, large-scale data and overfitting. Statistical analysis was based on
several detection and segmentation metrics including AUROC and Dice score. The
proposed method achieved an AUROC of 88.7% (pixel-level) and 96.7%
(image-level) on brain MRI datasets, outperforming State-of-The-Art (SOTA)
methods. On industrial surface datasets, the model also showed competitive
performance (AUROC = 99.8% pixel-level, 99.3% image-level) on MVTec AD dataset,
indicating strong cross-domain generalization. Studies on anomaly sample size
showed a monotonic increase in AUROC as more anomalies were seen, without
evidence of overfitting or additional computational cost. The domain-agnostic
semi-supervised approach using DRL shows significant promise for MRI anomaly
detection, achieving strong performance on both medical and industrial
datasets. Its robustness, generalizability and efficiency highlight its
potential for real-world clinical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集压缩方法在极端压缩下难以平衡性能和保真度，且忽视了颜色作为信息载体和语义单元的双重作用。

Method: 提出DC3框架，结合校准选择策略和潜在扩散模型，增强图像颜色多样性而非生成全新图像。

Result: DC3在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，且首次利用预训练扩散模型微调压缩数据集，FID结果验证了其可行性。

Conclusion: DC3通过颜色补偿显著提升了数据集压缩的质量和泛化能力，为下游任务提供了高质量数据。

Abstract: Dataset condensation always faces a constitutive trade-off: balancing
performance and fidelity under extreme compression. Existing methods struggle
with two bottlenecks: image-level selection methods (Coreset Selection, Dataset
Quantization) suffer from inefficiency condensation, while pixel-level
optimization (Dataset Distillation) introduces semantic distortion due to
over-parameterization. With empirical observations, we find that a critical
problem in dataset condensation is the oversight of color's dual role as an
information carrier and a basic semantic representation unit. We argue that
improving the colorfulness of condensed images is beneficial for representation
learning. Motivated by this, we propose DC3: a Dataset Condensation framework
with Color Compensation. After a calibrated selection strategy, DC3 utilizes
the latent diffusion model to enhance the color diversity of an image rather
than creating a brand-new one. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior
performance and generalization of DC3 that outperforms SOTA methods across
multiple benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, besides focusing on
downstream tasks, DC3 is the first research to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion
models with condensed datasets. The FID results prove that training networks
with our high-quality datasets is feasible without model collapse or other
degradation issues. Code and generated data will be released soon.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D scene understanding have made significant strides
in enabling interaction with scenes using open-vocabulary queries, particularly
for VR/AR and robotic applications. Nevertheless, existing methods are hindered
by rigid offline pipelines and the inability to provide precise 3D object-level
understanding given open-ended queries. In this paper, we present
OpenGS-Fusion, an innovative open-vocabulary dense mapping framework that
improves semantic modeling and refines object-level understanding.
OpenGS-Fusion combines 3D Gaussian representation with a Truncated Signed
Distance Field to facilitate lossless fusion of semantic features on-the-fly.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel multimodal language-guided approach named
MLLM-Assisted Adaptive Thresholding, which refines the segmentation of 3D
objects by adaptively adjusting similarity thresholds, achieving an improvement
17\% in 3D mIoU compared to the fixed threshold strategy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in 3D object
understanding and scene reconstruction quality, as well as showcasing its
effectiveness in language-guided scene interaction. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像扩散模型的安全机制采用统一标准，忽视了用户因年龄、心理健康和个人信仰等因素形成的多样化安全边界。

Method: PSA框架将个性化用户配置文件集成到扩散过程中，通过交叉注意力机制调整模型行为。

Result: 实验表明，PSA在有害内容抑制和用户约束对齐方面优于现有方法，Win Rate和Pass Rate得分更高。

Conclusion: PSA框架成功实现了用户特定安全控制，同时保持了图像质量，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized visual content generation,
but current safety mechanisms apply uniform standards that often fail to
account for individual user preferences. These models overlook the diverse
safety boundaries shaped by factors like age, mental health, and personal
beliefs. To address this, we propose Personalized Safety Alignment (PSA), a
framework that allows user-specific control over safety behaviors in generative
models. PSA integrates personalized user profiles into the diffusion process,
adjusting the model's behavior to match individual safety preferences while
preserving image quality. We introduce a new dataset, Sage, which captures
user-specific safety preferences and incorporates these profiles through a
cross-attention mechanism. Experiments show that PSA outperforms existing
methods in harmful content suppression and aligns generated content better with
user constraints, achieving higher Win Rate and Pass Rate scores. Our code,
data, and models are publicly available at

Result: 在DIS5K基准测试中显著优于11种先进方法，Fβω提升4.6%。

Conclusion: LawDIS框架在精度和用户控制方面表现出色，适用于高精度个性化应用。

Abstract: We present LawDIS, a language-window-based controllable dichotomous image
segmentation (DIS) framework that produces high-quality object masks. Our
framework recasts DIS as an image-conditioned mask generation task within a
latent diffusion model, enabling seamless integration of user controls. LawDIS
is enhanced with macro-to-micro control modes. Specifically, in macro mode, we
introduce a language-controlled segmentation strategy (LS) to generate an
initial mask based on user-provided language prompts. In micro mode, a
window-controlled refinement strategy (WR) allows flexible refinement of
user-defined regions (i.e., size-adjustable windows) within the initial mask.
Coordinated by a mode switcher, these modes can operate independently or
jointly, making the framework well-suited for high-accuracy, personalised
applications. Extensive experiments on the DIS5K benchmark reveal that our
LawDIS significantly outperforms 11 cutting-edge methods across all metrics.
Notably, compared to the second-best model MVANet, we achieve $F_\beta^\omega$
gains of 4.6\% with both the LS and WR strategies and 3.6\% gains with only the
LS strategy on DIS-TE. Codes will be made available at

Result: 在多个公共基准测试中，TEACH训练的模型准确性显著提升，尤其在挑战性条件下表现优异。

Conclusion: TEACH无需外部预训练，无推理开销，模型无关，可无缝集成到现有框架中，具有鲁棒性和广泛适用性。

Abstract: Scene Text Recognition (STR) remains a challenging task due to complex visual
appearances and limited semantic priors. We propose TEACH, a novel training
paradigm that injects ground-truth text into the model as auxiliary input and
progressively reduces its influence during training. By encoding target labels
into the embedding space and applying loss-aware masking, TEACH simulates a
curriculum learning process that guides the model from label-dependent learning
to fully visual recognition. Unlike language model-based approaches, TEACH
requires no external pretraining and introduces no inference overhead. It is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing encoder-decoder
frameworks. Extensive experiments across multiple public benchmarks show that
models trained with TEACH achieve consistently improved accuracy, especially

Method: 采用粗到细策略，从小规模点集开始跟踪，逐步扩展轨迹，并引入可学习的插值模块；优化相关性特征计算。

Result: 算法比现有方法快5-100倍，同时保持最先进的跟踪精度。

Conclusion: 新算法高效解决了计算瓶颈，显著提升了密集长期3D点跟踪的性能。

Abstract: We propose a novel algorithm for accelerating dense long-term 3D point
tracking in videos. Through analysis of existing state-of-the-art methods, we
identify two major computational bottlenecks. First, transformer-based
iterative tracking becomes expensive when handling a large number of
trajectories. To address this, we introduce a coarse-to-fine strategy that
begins tracking with a small subset of points and progressively expands the set
of tracked trajectories. The newly added trajectories are initialized using a
learnable interpolation module, which is trained end-to-end alongside the
tracking network. Second, we propose an optimization that significantly reduces
the cost of correlation feature computation, another key bottleneck in prior
methods. Together, these improvements lead to a 5-100x speedup over existing
approaches while maintaining state-of-the-art tracking accuracy.

Result: 在无位姿监督下，SPFSplat在新视角合成和相对位姿估计中达到先进水平。

Conclusion: SPFSplat的位姿无关训练和高效设计使其适用于实际应用，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: We introduce SPFSplat, an efficient framework for 3D Gaussian splatting from
sparse multi-view images, requiring no ground-truth poses during training or
inference. It employs a shared feature extraction backbone, enabling
simultaneous prediction of 3D Gaussian primitives and camera poses in a
canonical space from unposed inputs within a single feed-forward step.
Alongside the rendering loss based on estimated novel-view poses, a
reprojection loss is integrated to enforce the learning of pixel-aligned
Gaussian primitives for enhanced geometric constraints. This pose-free training
paradigm and efficient one-step feed-forward design make SPFSplat well-suited
for practical applications. Remarkably, despite the absence of pose
supervision, SPFSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view
synthesis even under significant viewpoint changes and limited image overlap.
It also surpasses recent methods trained with geometry priors in relative pose
estimation. Code and trained models are available on our project page:

Result: 实验表明，该方法在功能区域定位和分类任务上均表现更优。

Conclusion: 该方法通过联合建模和分阶段推理，显著提升了3D物体功能区域的理解能力。

Abstract: A core problem of Embodied AI is to learn object manipulation from
observation, as humans do. To achieve this, it is important to localize 3D
object affordance areas through observation such as images (3D affordance
grounding) and understand their functionalities (affordance classification).
Previous attempts usually tackle these two tasks separately, leading to
inconsistent predictions due to lacking proper modeling of their dependency. In
addition, these methods typically only ground the incomplete affordance areas
depicted in images, failing to predict the full potential affordance areas, and
operate at a fixed scale, resulting in difficulty in coping with affordances
significantly varying in scale with respect to the whole object. To address
these issues, we propose a novel approach that learns an affordance-aware 3D
representation and employs a stage-wise inference strategy leveraging the
dependency between grounding and classification tasks. Specifically, we first
develop a cross-modal 3D representation through efficient fusion and
multi-scale geometric feature propagation, enabling inference of full potential
affordance areas at a suitable regional scale. Moreover, we adopt a simple
two-stage prediction mechanism, effectively coupling grounding and
classification for better affordance understanding. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, showing improved performance in both affordance
grounding and classification.

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法和数据集为3D视觉定位提供了更精确的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual grounding aims to identify objects or regions in a scene based on
natural language descriptions, essential for spatially aware perception in
autonomous driving. However, existing visual grounding tasks typically depend
on bounding boxes that often fail to capture fine-grained details. Not all
voxels within a bounding box are occupied, resulting in inaccurate object
representations. To address this, we introduce a benchmark for 3D occupancy
grounding in challenging outdoor scenes. Built on the nuScenes dataset, it
integrates natural language with voxel-level occupancy annotations, offering
more precise object perception compared to the traditional grounding task.
Moreover, we propose GroundingOcc, an end-to-end model designed for 3D
occupancy grounding through multi-modal learning. It combines visual, textual,
and point cloud features to predict object location and occupancy information
from coarse to fine. Specifically, GroundingOcc comprises a multimodal encoder
for feature extraction, an occupancy head for voxel-wise predictions, and a
grounding head to refine localization. Additionally, a 2D grounding module and
a depth estimation module enhance geometric understanding, thereby boosting
model performance. Extensive experiments on the benchmark demonstrate that our
method outperforms existing baselines on 3D occupancy grounding. The dataset is

Abstract: Civil infrastructure systems covers large land areas and needs frequent
inspections to maintain their public service capabilities. The conventional
approaches of manual surveys or vehicle-based automated surveys to assess
infrastructure conditions are often labor-intensive and time-consuming. For
this reason, it is worthwhile to explore more cost-effective methods for
monitoring and maintaining these infrastructures. Fortunately, recent
advancements in satellite systems and image processing algorithms have opened
up new possibilities. Numerous satellite systems have been employed to monitor
infrastructure conditions and identify damages. Due to the improvement in
ground sample distance (GSD), the level of detail that can be captured has
significantly increased. Taking advantage of these technology advancement, this
research investigated to evaluate pavement conditions using deep learning
models for analyzing satellite images. We gathered over 3,000 satellite images
of pavement sections, together with pavement evaluation ratings from TxDOT's
PMIS database. The results of our study show an accuracy rate is exceeding 90%.
This research paves the way for a rapid and cost-effective approach to
evaluating the pavement network in the future.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RoadMamba的方法，结合全局和局部感知，用于道路表面分类任务，通过DualSSM和DAF提取并融合特征，实验表明其在大规模数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于视觉技术提前获取道路表面条件对自动驾驶车辆的规划和控制系统至关重要，但现有Mamba架构在局部纹理提取上不足，影响了分类性能。

Method: 提出RoadMamba方法，利用DualSSM提取全局语义和局部纹理，通过DAF解码和融合特征，并引入双辅助损失约束网络。

Result: 在包含100万样本的大规模道路表面分类数据集上，RoadMamba达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: RoadMamba通过结合全局和局部感知，显著提升了道路表面分类的准确性，为自动驾驶提供了更可靠的支持。

Abstract: Acquiring the road surface conditions in advance based on visual technologies
provides effective information for the planning and control system of
autonomous vehicles, thus improving the safety and driving comfort of the
vehicles. Recently, the Mamba architecture based on state-space models has
shown remarkable performance in visual processing tasks, benefiting from the
efficient global receptive field. However, existing Mamba architectures
struggle to achieve state-of-the-art visual road surface classification due to
their lack of effective extraction of the local texture of the road surface. In
this paper, we explore for the first time the potential of visual Mamba
architectures for road surface classification task and propose a method that
effectively combines local and global perception, called RoadMamba.
Specifically, we utilize the Dual State Space Model (DualSSM) to effectively
extract the global semantics and local texture of the road surface and decode
and fuse the dual features through the Dual Attention Fusion (DAF). In
addition, we propose a dual auxiliary loss to explicitly constrain dual
branches, preventing the network from relying only on global semantic
information from the deep large receptive field and ignoring the local texture.
The proposed RoadMamba achieves the state-of-the-art performance in experiments
on a large-scale road surface classification dataset containing 1 million
samples.

*Yuanlin Yang,Quanjian Song,Zhexian Gao,Ge Wang,Shanshan Li,Xiaoyan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StyDeco提出了一种无监督框架，通过特定任务优化的文本表示解决扩散模型在风格迁移中的语义鸿沟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型将文本描述视为统一指导，忽略了文本与视觉风格的空间属性差异，导致语义结构和细节丢失。

Method: 框架包括Prior-Guided Data Distillation（PGD）和Contrastive Semantic Decoupling（CSD），前者无监督提取风格知识，后者通过域特定权重优化文本编码器。

Result: 在三个经典基准测试中，StyDeco在风格保真度和结构保留上优于现有方法，并支持去风格化。

Conclusion: StyDeco有效解决了风格迁移中的语义保留问题，展示了其扩展性和实用性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the dominant paradigm for style transfer,
but their text-driven mechanism is hindered by a core limitation: it treats
textual descriptions as uniform, monolithic guidance. This limitation overlooks
the semantic gap between the non-spatial nature of textual descriptions and the
spatially-aware attributes of visual style, often leading to the loss of
semantic structure and fine-grained details during stylization. In this paper,
we propose StyDeco, an unsupervised framework that resolves this limitation by
learning text representations specifically tailored for the style transfer
task. Our framework first employs Prior-Guided Data Distillation (PGD), a
strategy designed to distill stylistic knowledge without human supervision. It
leverages a powerful frozen generative model to automatically synthesize
pseudo-paired data. Subsequently, we introduce Contrastive Semantic Decoupling
(CSD), a task-specific objective that adapts a text encoder using
domain-specific weights. CSD performs a two-class clustering in the semantic
space, encouraging source and target representations to form distinct clusters.
Extensive experiments on three classic benchmarks demonstrate that our
framework outperforms several existing approaches in both stylistic fidelity
and structural preservation, highlighting its effectiveness in style transfer
with semantic preservation. In addition, our framework supports a unique
de-stylization process, further demonstrating its extensibility. Our code is
vailable at https://github.com/QuanjianSong/StyDeco.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用视觉场景上下文信息增强楼层平面定位（FLoc）的方法，通过无监督学习和聚类约束预训练房间判别器，显著提高了定位的鲁棒性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 楼层平面图因重复结构易导致定位模糊，现有方法忽略视觉图像提供的丰富上下文信息，本文旨在利用场景布局先验消除定位不确定性。

Method: 提出无监督学习技术，通过聚类约束预训练房间判别器，提取隐藏房间类型信息，并将其注入FLoc算法中以利用场景上下文。

Result: 在两个标准FLoc基准测试中，该方法优于现有技术，显著提升了鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: 通过引入视觉场景上下文信息，该方法有效解决了FLoc中的定位模糊问题，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Since a building's floorplan remains consistent over time and is inherently
robust to changes in visual appearance, visual Floorplan Localization (FLoc)
has received increasing attention from researchers. However, as a compact and
minimalist representation of the building's layout, floorplans contain many
repetitive structures (e.g., hallways and corners), thus easily result in
ambiguous localization. Existing methods either pin their hopes on matching 2D
structural cues in floorplans or rely on 3D geometry-constrained visual
pre-trainings, ignoring the richer contextual information provided by visual
images. In this paper, we suggest using broader visual scene context to empower
FLoc algorithms with scene layout priors to eliminate localization uncertainty.
In particular, we propose an unsupervised learning technique with clustering
constraints to pre-train a room discriminator on self-collected unlabeled room
images. Such a discriminator can empirically extract the hidden room type of
the observed image and distinguish it from other room types. By injecting the
scene context information summarized by the discriminator into an FLoc
algorithm, the room style knowledge is effectively exploited to guide definite
visual FLoc. We conducted sufficient comparative studies on two standard visual
Floc benchmarks. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods and achieves significant improvements in robustness
and accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖FLAME网格和基于高斯渲染的两阶段过程，常因网格与图像不对齐导致渲染质量下降和细节丢失。

Method: 引入动量引导一致几何模块（Momentum-Guided Consistent Geometry）和潜在纹理注意力机制（Latent Texture Attention），动态优化几何和纹理。

Result: 实验表明，MoGaFace在高保真头部虚拟形象重建和新视角合成质量上表现优异，即使在网格初始化不准确和真实场景下也有效。

Conclusion: MoGaFace通过动态优化和一致性机制，显著提升了3D头部虚拟形象的渲染质量和细节保留能力。

Abstract: Existing 3D head avatar reconstruction methods adopt a two-stage process,
relying on tracked FLAME meshes derived from facial landmarks, followed by
Gaussian-based rendering. However, misalignment between the estimated mesh and
target images often leads to suboptimal rendering quality and loss of fine
visual details. In this paper, we present MoGaFace, a novel 3D head avatar
modeling framework that continuously refines facial geometry and texture
attributes throughout the Gaussian rendering process. To address the
misalignment between estimated FLAME meshes and target images, we introduce the
Momentum-Guided Consistent Geometry module, which incorporates a
momentum-updated expression bank and an expression-aware correction mechanism
to ensure temporal and multi-view consistency. Additionally, we propose Latent
Texture Attention, which encodes compact multi-view features into head-aware
representations, enabling geometry-aware texture refinement via integration
into Gaussians. Extensive experiments show that MoGaFace achieves high-fidelity
head avatar reconstruction and significantly improves novel-view synthesis
quality, even under inaccurate mesh initialization and unconstrained real-world
settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Eigen Neural Network (ENN)的新架构，通过重新参数化权重为层共享的正交特征基，解决了传统DNN中权重结构混乱的问题，提升了特征表示和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度神经网络的梯度优化过程容易产生无序的权重结构，损害特征清晰度并降低学习动态。

Method: ENN通过层共享的学习正交特征基重新参数化权重，强制解耦和对齐权重动态，无需正则化。

Result: ENN在ImageNet等大规模图像分类任务中表现优于现有方法，并在跨模态图像-文本检索中创下新基准。此外，其变体ENN-ℓ实现了无反向传播的高效本地学习，训练速度提升2倍以上且精度更高。

Conclusion: ENN通过直接解决反向传播的表示缺陷，提供了更高性能和更高效的并行训练方案。

Abstract: The remarkable success of Deep Neural Networks(DNN) is driven by
gradient-based optimization, yet this process is often undermined by its
tendency to produce disordered weight structures, which harms feature clarity
and degrades learning dynamics. To address this fundamental representational
flaw, we introduced the Eigen Neural Network (ENN), a novel architecture that
reparameterizes each layer's weights in a layer-shared, learned orthonormal
eigenbasis. This design enforces decorrelated, well-aligned weight dynamics
axiomatically, rather than through regularization, leading to more structured
and discriminative feature representations. When integrated with standard BP,
ENN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on large-scale image
classification benchmarks, including ImageNet, and its superior representations
generalize to set a new benchmark in cross-modal image-text retrieval.
Furthermore, ENN's principled structure enables a highly efficient,
backpropagation-free(BP-free) local learning variant, ENN-$\ell$. This variant
not only resolves BP's procedural bottlenecks to achieve over 2$\times$
training speedup via parallelism, but also, remarkably, surpasses the accuracy
of end-to-end backpropagation. ENN thus presents a new architectural paradigm
that directly remedies the representational deficiencies of BP, leading to
enhanced performance and enabling a more efficient, parallelizable training
regime.

Result: 在多个数据集上，ParaRevSNN的精度与标准RevSNN相当或更高，训练时间减少35.2%，推理时间降至18.15%。

Conclusion: ParaRevSNN适合资源受限场景，兼具高效性和性能。

Abstract: Reversible Spiking Neural Networks (RevSNNs) enable memory-efficient training
by reconstructing forward activations during backpropagation, but suffer from
high latency due to strictly sequential computation. To overcome this
limitation, we propose ParaRevSNN, a parallel reversible SNN architecture that
decouples sequential dependencies between reversible blocks while preserving
reversibility. This design enables inter-block parallelism, significantly
accelerating training and inference while retaining the memory-saving benefits
of reversibility. Experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, CIFAR10-DVS, and DVS128
Gesture demonstrate that ParaRevSNN matches or exceeds the accuracy of standard
RevSNNs, while reducing training time by up to 35.2\% and inference time to
18.15\%, making it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained
scenarios.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种多缓存增强的原型测试时间适应方法（MCP）及其改进版MCP++，通过三个缓存机制提升模型在未知测试分布上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于缓存的测试时间适应方法依赖低熵样本构建原型，但在分布偏移下可能不可靠，且无法保证类内紧凑性。研究发现性能与类内紧凑性正相关，因此提出新方法。

Method: 提出MCP方法，包含熵缓存、对齐缓存和负缓存，分别用于初始化原型、整合视觉与文本信息以及校准预测。进一步开发MCP++框架，引入跨模态原型对齐和残差学习。

Result: 在15个下游任务上的实验表明，MCP和MCP++实现了最先进的泛化性能。

Conclusion: MCP和MCP++通过多缓存机制和跨模态对齐显著提升了测试时间适应的性能，尤其在分布偏移下表现优异。

Abstract: In zero-shot setting, test-time adaptation adjusts pre-trained models using
unlabeled data from the test phase to enhance performance on unknown test
distributions. Existing cache-enhanced TTA methods rely on a low-entropy
criterion to select samples for prototype construction, assuming intra-class
compactness. However, low-entropy samples may be unreliable under distribution
shifts, and the resulting prototypes may not ensure compact intra-class
distributions. This study identifies a positive correlation between
cache-enhanced performance and intra-class compactness. Based on this
observation, we propose a Multi-Cache enhanced Prototype-based Test-Time
Adaptation (MCP) featuring three caches: an entropy cache for initializing
prototype representations with low-entropy samples, an align cache for
integrating visual and textual information to achieve compact intra-class
distributions, and a negative cache for prediction calibration using
high-entropy samples. We further developed MCP++, a framework incorporating
cross-modal prototype alignment and residual learning, introducing prototype
residual fine-tuning. Comparative and ablation experiments across 15 downstream
tasks demonstrate that the proposed method and framework achieve
state-of-the-art generalization performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多视图学习模型在开放集场景中表现不佳，主要因为隐含的类别完整性假设和视图诱导的静态偏差。

Method: 设计了O-Mix合成策略生成虚拟样本，并引入辅助模糊感知网络和HSIC对比去偏模块。

Result: 在多个多视图基准测试中，该框架显著提升了未知类别的识别能力，同时保持了封闭集性能。

Conclusion: 该框架通过模糊校准和去偏，有效解决了开放集学习中的挑战。

Abstract: Existing multi-view learning models struggle in open-set scenarios due to
their implicit assumption of class completeness. Moreover, static view-induced
biases, which arise from spurious view-label associations formed during
training, further degrade their ability to recognize unknown categories. In
this paper, we propose a multi-view open-set learning framework via ambiguity
uncertainty calibration and view-wise debiasing. To simulate ambiguous samples,
we design O-Mix, a novel synthesis strategy to generate virtual samples with
calibrated open-set ambiguity uncertainty. These samples are further processed
by an auxiliary ambiguity perception network that captures atypical patterns
for improved open-set adaptation. Furthermore, we incorporate an HSIC-based
contrastive debiasing module that enforces independence between view-specific
ambiguous and view-consistent representations, encouraging the model to learn
generalizable features. Extensive experiments on diverse multi-view benchmarks
demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently enhances unknown-class
recognition while preserving strong closed-set performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应内容补偿方法（ACCM），通过图像标题减少视觉信息损失，显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）的高计算成本限制了广泛应用，现有方法在高修剪率下性能下降严重。

Method: ACCM包含轻量级标题模型和选择器，生成与问题相关的描述并选择最佳标题，无需人工标注。

Result: 在七个基准测试中，ACCM以更低的计算成本显著优于现有方法（如FLOPs减少6.5%，性能提升20.6%）。

Conclusion: ACCM有效解决了高修剪率下的视觉信息损失问题，为LVLMs的广泛应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Despite the great success of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), their high
computational cost severely limits their broad applications. The computational
cost of LVLMs mainly stems from the visual sequence of the input, which
consists of hundreds or even thousands of tokens. Although existing methods
have made progress by removing redundant tokens, they suffer from severe
performance degradation with high pruning rates due to the loss of visual
information. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Content Compensation Method
(ACCM), which can effectively mitigate the visual information loss via an image
caption. Specifically, ACCM comprises two key components: a lightweight caption
model and a selector. Firstly the caption model generates question-related
descriptions under the guidance of the user instruction. Then the selector
further identifies a contextually appropriate caption from multiple candidates.
Leveraging self-supervised learning, our modules could be learned efficiently
without any human or automated labeling. We conduct extensive experiments
across seven benchmarks and the results show that ACCM significantly
outperforms existing methods with lower FLOPs (e.g., surpassing SOTA by 20.6%
with 6.5% fewer FLOPs).

Result: 实验表明，OCSplats在不同复杂场景中均实现领先的重建性能和精确的标签噪声分类。

Conclusion: OCSplats通过创新技术解决了3DGS中的噪声问题，无需调参即可适应多样化场景。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become one of the most promising 3D
reconstruction technologies. However, label noise in real-world scenarios-such
as moving objects, non-Lambertian surfaces, and shadows-often leads to
reconstruction errors. Existing 3DGS-Bsed anti-noise reconstruction methods
either fail to separate noise effectively or require scene-specific fine-tuning
of hyperparameters, making them difficult to apply in practice. This paper
re-examines the problem of anti-noise reconstruction from the perspective of
epistemic uncertainty, proposing a novel framework, OCSplats. By combining key
technologies such as hybrid noise assessment and observation-based cognitive
correction, the accuracy of noise classification in areas with cognitive
differences has been significantly improved. Moreover, to address the issue of
varying noise proportions in different scenarios, we have designed a label
noise classification pipeline based on dynamic anchor points. This pipeline
enables OCSplats to be applied simultaneously to scenarios with vastly
different noise proportions without adjusting parameters. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that OCSplats always achieve leading reconstruction performance and
precise label noise classification in scenes of different complexity levels.

Motivation: 现有检测器在未知生成模型下泛化能力不足，尤其是当真实与生成图像的语义内容高度相似时。

Method: 提出NS-Net框架，结合NULL-Space投影和对比学习，并设计Patch Selection策略以减少语义偏差。

Result: 在包含40种生成模型的开放世界基准测试中，NS-Net检测准确率提升7.4%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NS-Net在GAN和扩散模型生成的图像检测中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models, such as GANs and diffusion models,
has facilitated the creation of highly realistic images, raising growing
concerns over their misuse in security-sensitive domains. While existing
detectors perform well under known generative settings, they often fail to
generalize to unknown generative models, especially when semantic content
between real and fake images is closely aligned. In this paper, we revisit the
use of CLIP features for AI-generated image detection and uncover a critical
limitation: the high-level semantic information embedded in CLIP's visual
features hinders effective discrimination. To address this, we propose NS-Net,
a novel detection framework that leverages NULL-Space projection to decouple
semantic information from CLIP's visual features, followed by contrastive
learning to capture intrinsic distributional differences between real and
generated images. Furthermore, we design a Patch Selection strategy to preserve
fine-grained artifacts by mitigating semantic bias caused by global image
structures. Extensive experiments on an open-world benchmark comprising images
generated by 40 diverse generative models show that NS-Net outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 7.4\% improvement in detection accuracy,
thereby demonstrating strong generalization across both GAN- and
diffusion-based image generation techniques.

Motivation: 减少密集像素级标注的高成本，利用弱监督（如图像级标签和自然语言描述）进行面部解析。

Result: 在CelebAMask-HQ、LaPa和Helen数据集上显著优于现有弱监督语义分割方法。

Conclusion: DisFaceRep有效解决了WSFP任务中的共现组件问题，为弱监督面部解析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Face parsing aims to segment facial images into key components such as eyes,
lips, and eyebrows. While existing methods rely on dense pixel-level
annotations, such annotations are expensive and labor-intensive to obtain. To
reduce annotation cost, we introduce Weakly Supervised Face Parsing (WSFP), a
new task setting that performs dense facial component segmentation using only
weak supervision, such as image-level labels and natural language descriptions.
WSFP introduces unique challenges due to the high co-occurrence and visual
similarity of facial components, which lead to ambiguous activations and
degraded parsing performance. To address this, we propose DisFaceRep, a
representation disentanglement framework designed to separate co-occurring
facial components through both explicit and implicit mechanisms. Specifically,
we introduce a co-occurring component disentanglement strategy to explicitly
reduce dataset-level bias, and a text-guided component disentanglement loss to
guide component separation using language supervision implicitly. Extensive
experiments on CelebAMask-HQ, LaPa, and Helen demonstrate the difficulty of
WSFP and the effectiveness of DisFaceRep, which significantly outperforms
existing weakly supervised semantic segmentation methods. The code will be
released at

Abstract: In this work, we handle a new problem of Open-Domain Open-Vocabulary (ODOV)
object detection, which considers the detection model's adaptability to the
real world including both domain and category shifts. For this problem, we
first construct a new benchmark OD-LVIS, which includes 46,949 images, covers
18 complex real-world domains and 1,203 categories, and provides a
comprehensive dataset for evaluating real-world object detection. Besides, we
develop a novel baseline method for ODOV detection.The proposed method first
leverages large language models to generate the domain-agnostic text prompts
for category embedding. It further learns the domain embedding from the given
image, which, during testing, can be integrated into the category embedding to
form the customized domain-specific category embedding for each test image. We
provide sufficient benchmark evaluations for the proposed ODOV detection task
and report the results, which verify the rationale of ODOV detection, the
usefulness of our benchmark, and the superiority of the proposed method.

Conclusion: 该框架通过跨模态一致性和自增强微调，有效提升了图像聚类的性能，突破了冻结编码器的限制。

Abstract: While large language-image pre-trained models like CLIP offer powerful
generic features for image clustering, existing methods typically freeze the
encoder. This creates a fundamental mismatch between the model's task-agnostic
representations and the demands of a specific clustering task, imposing a
ceiling on performance. To break this ceiling, we propose a self-enhanced
framework based on cross-modal semantic consistency for efficient image
clustering. Our framework first builds a strong foundation via Cross-Modal
Semantic Consistency and then specializes the encoder through Self-Enhancement.
In the first stage, we focus on Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency. By mining
consistency between generated image-text pairs at the instance, cluster
assignment, and cluster center levels, we train lightweight clustering heads to
align with the rich semantics of the pre-trained model. This alignment process
is bolstered by a novel method for generating higher-quality cluster centers
and a dynamic balancing regularizer to ensure well-distributed assignments. In
the second stage, we introduce a Self-Enhanced fine-tuning strategy. The
well-aligned model from the first stage acts as a reliable pseudo-label
generator. These self-generated supervisory signals are then used to feed back
the efficient, joint optimization of the vision encoder and clustering heads,
unlocking their full potential. Extensive experiments on six mainstream
datasets show that our method outperforms existing deep clustering methods by
significant margins. Notably, our ViT-B/32 model already matches or even
surpasses the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods built upon the far larger
ViT-L/14.

Method: STDNet包含空间差异分支和时间差异分支。空间差异分支通过动态对齐RGB特征和学习空间差异表示来校准深度；时间差异分支则优先传播相邻帧的RGB和深度信息，实现精确的运动补偿。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，STDNet优于现有方法。

Conclusion: STDNet通过空间和时间差异机制有效解决了长尾分布问题，提升了视频深度超分辨率的性能。

Abstract: Depth super-resolution has achieved impressive performance, and the
incorporation of multi-frame information further enhances reconstruction
quality. Nevertheless, statistical analyses reveal that video depth
super-resolution remains affected by pronounced long-tailed distributions, with
the long-tailed effects primarily manifesting in spatial non-smooth regions and
temporal variation zones. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
SpatioTemporal Difference Network (STDNet) comprising two core branches: a
spatial difference branch and a temporal difference branch. In the spatial
difference branch, we introduce a spatial difference mechanism to mitigate the
long-tailed issues in spatial non-smooth regions. This mechanism dynamically
aligns RGB features with learned spatial difference representations, enabling
intra-frame RGB-D aggregation for depth calibration. In the temporal difference
branch, we further design a temporal difference strategy that preferentially
propagates temporal variation information from adjacent RGB and depth frames to
the current depth frame, leveraging temporal difference representations to
achieve precise motion compensation in temporal long-tailed areas. Extensive
experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our STDNet, outperforming existing approaches.

Method: 提出ACS方法，将蒸馏数据集分为多个课程，通过对抗损失引导扩散模型生成多样化图像，确保信息覆盖。

Result: 在Imagewoof和ImageNet-1k上分别提升了4.1%和2.1%。

Conclusion: ACS通过对抗引导和课程学习，显著提升了数据集蒸馏的性能和多样性。

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to encapsulate the rich information contained in
dataset into a compact distilled dataset but it faces performance degradation
as the image-per-class (IPC) setting or image resolution grows larger. Recent
advancements demonstrate that integrating diffusion generative models can
effectively facilitate the compression of large-scale datasets while
maintaining efficiency due to their superiority in matching data distribution
and summarizing representative patterns. However, images sampled from diffusion
models are always blamed for lack of diversity which may lead to information
redundancy when multiple independent sampled images are aggregated as a
distilled dataset. To address this issue, we propose Adversary-guided
Curriculum Sampling (ACS), which partitions the distilled dataset into multiple
curricula. For generating each curriculum, ACS guides diffusion sampling
process by an adversarial loss to challenge a discriminator trained on sampled
images, thus mitigating information overlap between curricula and fostering a
more diverse distilled dataset. Additionally, as the discriminator evolves with
the progression of curricula, ACS generates images from simpler to more
complex, ensuring efficient and systematic coverage of target data
informational spectrum. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
ACS, which achieves substantial improvements of 4.1\% on Imagewoof and 2.1\% on
ImageNet-1k over the state-of-the-art.

Motivation: 现有基准测试缺乏对噪声和不确定性建模的细粒度评估，因此需要新的测试标准。

Method: 通过引入噪声损坏的点云和点级不确定性注释（高斯噪声参数），评估了三种模型（PointNet、DGCNN和Point Transformer v3）在不同噪声水平下的表现。

Result: 所有模型在噪声增加时性能下降，但Point Transformer v3表现出更好的校准性，其预测的不确定性与实际测量不确定性更接近。

Conclusion: ModelNet40-E为点云分类模型的鲁棒性和不确定性建模提供了有效的评估工具，Point Transformer v3在噪声环境下表现最佳。

Abstract: We introduce ModelNet40-E, a new benchmark designed to assess the robustness

noise. Unlike existing benchmarks, ModelNet40-E provides both noise-corrupted
point clouds and point-wise uncertainty annotations via Gaussian noise
parameters ({\sigma}, {\mu}), enabling fine-grained evaluation of uncertainty
modeling. We evaluate three popular models-PointNet, DGCNN, and Point
Transformer v3-across multiple noise levels using classification accuracy,
calibration metrics, and uncertainty-awareness. While all models degrade under
increasing noise, Point Transformer v3 demonstrates superior calibration, with
predicted uncertainties more closely aligned with the underlying measurement
uncertainty.

Motivation: 现有零样本视频描述方法因忽略时间动态和视频级监督不足而表现不佳。

Method: 提出SGCap方法，包含语义组解码（SGD）、关键句子选择（KSS）和概率采样监督（PSS）模块。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著优于现有零样本方法，甚至接近全监督方法的性能。

Conclusion: SGCap通过建模时间动态和多样化监督，有效提升了零样本视频描述的能力。

Abstract: Zero-shot video captioning aims to generate sentences for describing videos
without training the model on video-text pairs, which remains underexplored.
Existing zero-shot image captioning methods typically adopt a text-only
training paradigm, where a language decoder reconstructs single-sentence
embeddings obtained from CLIP. However, directly extending them to the video
domain is suboptimal, as applying average pooling over all frames neglects
temporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose a Semantic Group
Captioning (SGCap) method for zero-shot video captioning. In particular, it
develops the Semantic Group Decoding (SGD) strategy to employ multi-frame
information while explicitly modeling inter-frame temporal relationships.
Furthermore, existing zero-shot captioning methods that rely on cosine
similarity for sentence retrieval and reconstruct the description supervised by
a single frame-level caption, fail to provide sufficient video-level
supervision. To alleviate this, we introduce two key components, including the
Key Sentences Selection (KSS) module and the Probability Sampling Supervision
(PSS) module. The two modules construct semantically-diverse sentence groups
that models temporal dynamics and guide the model to capture inter-sentence
causal relationships, thereby enhancing its generalization ability to video
captioning. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that SGCap
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art zero-shot alternatives and
even achieves performance competitive with fully supervised ones. Code is

TL;DR: PromptSafe是一个基于门控提示调优的框架，用于防止文本到图像（T2I）模型生成不安全内容，同时保持高质量生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大规模图像-文本数据集且防御静态，导致计算成本高、生成质量下降且适应性不足。PromptSafe旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 通过LLM重写不安全提示为安全版本，构建文本训练语料；优化通用软提示，结合门控机制动态调整防御强度。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，PromptSafe将不安全生成率降至2.36%，同时保持高生成质量，并展现出强泛化性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PromptSafe为T2I模型的安全部署提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have demonstrated remarkable generative
capabilities but remain vulnerable to producing not-safe-for-work (NSFW)
content, such as violent or explicit imagery. While recent moderation efforts
have introduced soft prompt-guided tuning by appending defensive tokens to the
input, these approaches often rely on large-scale curated image-text datasets
and apply static, one-size-fits-all defenses at inference time. However, this
results not only in high computational cost and degraded benign image quality,
but also in limited adaptability to the diverse and nuanced safety requirements
of real-world prompts. To address these challenges, we propose PromptSafe, a
gated prompt tuning framework that combines a lightweight, text-only supervised
soft embedding with an inference-time gated control network. Instead of
training on expensive image-text datasets, we first rewrite unsafe prompts into
semantically aligned but safe alternatives using an LLM, constructing an
efficient text-only training corpus. Based on this, we optimize a universal
soft prompt that repels unsafe and attracts safe embeddings during the
diffusion denoising process. To avoid over-suppressing benign prompts, we
introduce a gated mechanism that adaptively adjusts the defensive strength
based on estimated prompt toxicity, thereby aligning defense intensity with
prompt risk and ensuring strong protection for harmful inputs while preserving
benign generation quality. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and
T2I models show that PromptSafe achieves a SOTA unsafe generation rate (2.36%),
while preserving high benign fidelity. Furthermore, PromptSafe demonstrates
strong generalization to unseen harmful categories, robust transferability
across diffusion model architectures, and resilience under adaptive adversarial
attacks, highlighting its practical value for safe and scalable deployment.

Method: 提出基于置信度估计的算法和两种深度先验损失函数，利用局部一致性检查构建准密集对应关系。

Result: 在KITTI Stereo基准测试中达到无监督方法的最优匹配精度。

Conclusion: 该方法通过高效利用3D几何知识，显著提升了无监督立体匹配的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised stereo matching has garnered significant attention for its
independence from costly disparity annotations. Typical unsupervised methods
rely on the multi-view consistency assumption for training networks, which
suffer considerably from stereo matching ambiguities, such as repetitive
patterns and texture-less regions. A feasible solution lies in transferring 3D
geometric knowledge from a relative depth map to the stereo matching networks.
However, existing knowledge transfer methods learn depth ranking information
from randomly built sparse correspondences, which makes inefficient utilization
of 3D geometric knowledge and introduces noise from mistaken disparity
estimates. This work proposes a novel unsupervised learning framework to
address these challenges, which comprises a plug-and-play disparity confidence
estimation algorithm and two depth prior-guided loss functions. Specifically,
the local coherence consistency between neighboring disparities and their
corresponding relative depths is first checked to obtain disparity confidence.
Afterwards, quasi-dense correspondences are built using only confident
disparity estimates to facilitate efficient depth ranking learning. Finally, a
dual disparity smoothness loss is proposed to boost stereo matching performance
at disparity discontinuities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art stereo matching accuracy on the KITTI Stereo
benchmarks among all unsupervised stereo matching methods.

Result: 在肾癌和肺癌数据集上表现优于单提示基线，接近最先进模型。

Conclusion: 通过领域知识和多代理生成描述，显著提升了视觉语言模型在多实例学习中的性能。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is the leading approach for whole slide
image (WSI) classification, enabling efficient analysis of gigapixel pathology
slides. Recent work has introduced vision-language models (VLMs) into MIL
pipelines to incorporate medical knowledge through text-based class
descriptions rather than simple class names. However, when these methods rely
on large language models (LLMs) to generate clinical descriptions or use
fixed-length prompts to represent complex pathology concepts, the limited token
capacity of VLMs often constrains the expressiveness and richness of the
encoded class information. Additionally, descriptions generated solely by LLMs
may lack domain grounding and fine-grained medical specificity, leading to
suboptimal alignment with visual features. To address these challenges, we
propose a vision-language MIL framework with two key contributions: (1) A
grounded multi-agent description generation system that leverages curated
pathology textbooks and agent specialization (e.g., morphology, spatial
context) to produce accurate and diverse clinical descriptions; (2) A text
encoding strategy using a list of descriptions rather than a single prompt,
capturing fine-grained and complementary clinical signals for better alignment
with visual features. Integrated into a VLM-MIL pipeline, our approach shows
improved performance over single-prompt class baselines and achieves results
comparable to state-of-the-art models, as demonstrated on renal and lung cancer
datasets.

Motivation: 解决合成数据训练的立体匹配模型在真实数据上泛化能力差的问题，避免模型依赖域相关的捷径特征。

Result: 在多个挑战性基准测试中显著提升了现有立体匹配网络的泛化性能。

Conclusion: UgDA方法简单、架构无关，能有效提升模型对跨域数据的适应能力。

Abstract: State-of-the-art stereo matching (SM) models trained on synthetic data often
fail to generalize to real data domains due to domain differences, such as
color, illumination, contrast, and texture. To address this challenge, we
leverage data augmentation to expand the training domain, encouraging the model
to acquire robust cross-domain feature representations instead of
domain-dependent shortcuts. This paper proposes an uncertainty-guided data
augmentation (UgDA) method, which argues that the image statistics in RGB space
(mean and standard deviation) carry the domain characteristics. Thus, samples
in unseen domains can be generated by properly perturbing these statistics.
Furthermore, to simulate more potential domains, Gaussian distributions founded
on batch-level statistics are poposed to model the unceratinty of perturbation
direction and intensity. Additionally, we further enforce feature consistency
between original and augmented data for the same scene, encouraging the model
to learn structure aware, shortcuts-invariant feature representations. Our
approach is simple, architecture-agnostic, and can be integrated into any SM
networks. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks have
demonstrated that our method can significantly improve the generalization
performance of existing SM networks.

Result: 在三个公开数据集上表现优异，AUROC分别达到66.4%、83.1%和63.4%。

Conclusion: C3D-AD框架有效解决了多类3D异常检测中的持续学习问题。

Abstract: 3D Anomaly Detection (AD) has shown great potential in detecting anomalies or
defects of high-precision industrial products. However, existing methods are
typically trained in a class-specific manner and also lack the capability of
learning from emerging classes. In this study, we proposed a continual learning
framework named Continual 3D Anomaly Detection (C3D-AD), which can not only
learn generalized representations for multi-class point clouds but also handle
new classes emerging over time.Specifically, in the feature extraction module,
to extract generalized local features from diverse product types of different
tasks efficiently, Kernel Attention with random feature Layer (KAL) is
introduced, which normalizes the feature space. Then, to reconstruct data
correctly and continually, an efficient Kernel Attention with learnable Advisor
(KAA) mechanism is proposed, which learns the information from new categories
while discarding redundant old information within both the encoder and decoder.
Finally, to keep the representation consistency over tasks, a Reconstruction
with Parameter Perturbation (RPP) module is proposed by designing a
representation rehearsal loss function, which ensures that the model remembers
previous category information and returns category-adaptive
representation.Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an average performance of
66.4%, 83.1%, and 63.4% AUROC on Real3D-AD, Anomaly-ShapeNet, and MulSen-AD,
respectively.

Abstract: Distal myopathy represents a genetically heterogeneous group of skeletal
muscle disorders with broad clinical manifestations, posing diagnostic
challenges in radiology. To address this, we propose a novel multimodal
attention-aware fusion architecture that combines features extracted from two
distinct deep learning models, one capturing global contextual information and
the other focusing on local details, representing complementary aspects of the
input data. Uniquely, our approach integrates these features through an
attention gate mechanism, enhancing both predictive performance and
interpretability. Our method achieves a high classification accuracy on the
BUSI benchmark and a proprietary distal myopathy dataset, while also generating
clinically relevant saliency maps that support transparent decision-making in
medical diagnosis. We rigorously evaluated interpretability through (1)
functionally grounded metrics, coherence scoring against reference masks and
incremental deletion analysis, and (2) application-grounded validation with
seven expert radiologists. While our fusion strategy boosts predictive
performance relative to single-stream and alternative fusion strategies, both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations reveal persistent gaps in anatomical
specificity and clinical usefulness of the interpretability. These findings
highlight the need for richer, context-aware interpretability methods and
human-in-the-loop feedback to meet clinicians' expectations in real-world
diagnostic settings.

Conclusion: CSINet通过增强全局和局部语义的利用，有效解决了遥感图像分割中的挑战。

Abstract: Recently, Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) has aroused
wide attention. To handle drastic scale variation of remote targets, existing
methods only use the full image as input and nest the saliency-preferring
techniques of cross-scale information interaction into traditional single-view
structure. Although effective for visually salient targets, they still struggle
in handling tiny, ambiguous ones in lots of real scenarios. In this work, we
instead propose a paralleled yet unified segmentation framework Cross-view
Semantics Interaction Network (CSINet) to solve the limitations. Motivated by
human behavior in observing targets of interest, the network orchestrates
visual cues from remote and close distances to conduct synergistic prediction.
In its every encoding stage, a Cross-View Window-attention module (CVWin) is
utilized to supplement global and local semantics into close-view and
remote-view branch features, finally promoting the unified representation of
feature in every encoding stage. In addition, we develop a Collaboratively
Dilated Attention enhanced Decoder (CDAD) to mine the orientation property of
target and meanwhile integrate cross-view multiscale features. The proposed
network seamlessly enhances the exploitation of global and local semantics,
achieving significant improvements over others while maintaining satisfactory
speed.

Conclusion: 结合生成扩散模型与统计色彩分割，为计算机辅助皮肤病学提供高效红斑检测方案。

Abstract: This study proposes a zero-shot image segmentation framework for detecting
erythema (redness of the skin) using edit-friendly inversion in diffusion
models. The method synthesizes reference images of the same patient that are
free from erythema via generative editing and then accurately aligns these
references with the original images. Color-space analysis is performed with
minimal user intervention to identify erythematous regions. This approach
significantly reduces the reliance on labeled dermatological datasets while
providing a scalable and flexible diagnostic support tool by avoiding the need
for any annotated training masks. In our initial qualitative experiments, the
pipeline successfully isolated facial erythema in diverse cases, demonstrating
performance improvements over baseline threshold-based techniques. These
results highlight the potential of combining generative diffusion models and
statistical color segmentation for computer-aided dermatology, enabling
efficient erythema detection without prior training data.

Conclusion: StyleSentinel为艺术作品版权保护提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The versatility of diffusion models in generating customized images has led
to unauthorized usage of personal artwork, which poses a significant threat to
the intellectual property of artists. Existing approaches relying on embedding
additional information, such as perturbations, watermarks, and backdoors,
suffer from limited defensive capabilities and fail to protect artwork
published online. In this paper, we propose StyleSentinel, an approach for
copyright protection of artwork by verifying an inherent stylistic fingerprint
in the artist's artwork. Specifically, we employ a semantic self-reconstruction
process to enhance stylistic expressiveness within the artwork, which
establishes a dense and style-consistent manifold foundation for feature
learning. Subsequently, we adaptively fuse multi-layer image features to encode
abstract artistic style into a compact stylistic fingerprint. Finally, we model
the target artist's style as a minimal enclosing hypersphere boundary in the
feature space, transforming complex copyright verification into a robust
one-class learning task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with
the state-of-the-art, StyleSentinel achieves superior performance on the
one-sample verification task. We also demonstrate the effectiveness through
online platforms.

Conclusion: ViLaCo通过引入语义监督和对比学习，有效弥补弱监督的不足，实现了高精度的伪造定位。

Abstract: Image forgery localization aims to precisely identify tampered regions within
images, but it commonly depends on costly pixel-level annotations. To alleviate
this annotation burden, weakly supervised image forgery localization (WSIFL)
has emerged, yet existing methods still achieve limited localization
performance as they mainly exploit intra-image consistency clues and lack
external semantic guidance to compensate for weak supervision. In this paper,
we propose ViLaCo, a vision-language collaborative reasoning framework that
introduces auxiliary semantic supervision distilled from pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs), enabling accurate pixel-level localization using
only image-level labels. Specifically, ViLaCo first incorporates semantic
knowledge through a vision-language feature modeling network, which jointly
extracts textual and visual priors using pre-trained VLMs. Next, an adaptive
vision-language reasoning network aligns textual semantics and visual features
through mutual interactions, producing semantically aligned representations.
Subsequently, these representations are passed into dual prediction heads,
where the coarse head performs image-level classification and the fine head
generates pixel-level localization masks, thereby bridging the gap between weak
supervision and fine-grained localization. Moreover, a contrastive patch
consistency module is introduced to cluster tampered features while separating
authentic ones, facilitating more reliable forgery discrimination. Extensive
experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that ViLaCo substantially
outperforms existing WSIFL methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in
both detection and localization accuracy.

combining NWD loss, knowledge distillation, and Albumentations-based weather
augmentation improves detection robustness, especially for small and distant
targets. Experiments show SBP-YOLO achieves 87.0% mAP (outperforming YOLOv11n
by 5.8%) and runs at 139.5 FPS on a Jetson AGX Xavier with TensorRT FP16
quantization. The results validate its effectiveness for real-time road
condition perception in intelligent suspension systems.

Result: 在对象发现任务上提升高达10分，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RandSF.Q方法在对象发现和动态建模任务中表现优异，为视频OCL领域设定了新标杆。

Abstract: Unsupervised video Object-Centric Learning (OCL) is promising as it enables
object-level scene representation and dynamics modeling as we humans do.
Mainstream video OCL methods adopt a recurrent architecture: An aggregator
aggregates current video frame into object features, termed slots, under some
queries; A transitioner transits current slots to queries for the next frame.
This is an effective architecture but all existing implementations both
(\textit{i1}) neglect to incorporate next frame features, the most informative
source for query prediction, and (\textit{i2}) fail to learn transition
dynamics, the knowledge essential for query prediction. To address these
issues, we propose Random Slot-Feature pair for learning Query prediction
(RandSF.Q): (\textit{t1}) We design a new transitioner to incorporate both
slots and features, which provides more information for query prediction;
(\textit{t2}) We train the transitioner to predict queries from slot-feature
pairs randomly sampled from available recurrences, which drives it to learn
transition dynamics. Experiments on scene representation demonstrate that our
method surpass existing video OCL methods significantly, e.g., up to 10 points
on object discovery, setting new state-of-the-art. Such superiority also
benefits downstream tasks like dynamics modeling. Our core source code and
training logs are available as the supplement.

Abstract: It is of crucial importance to assess damages promptly and accurately in
humanitarian assistance and disaster response (HADR). Current deep learning
approaches struggle to generalize effectively due to the imbalance of data
classes, scarcity of moderate damage examples, and human inaccuracy in pixel
labeling during HADR situations. To accommodate for these limitations and
exploit state-of-the-art techniques in vision-language models (VLMs) to fuse
imagery with human knowledge understanding, there is an opportunity to generate
a diversified set of image-based damage data effectively. Our initial
experimental results suggest encouraging data generation quality, which
demonstrates an improvement in classifying scenes with different levels of
structural damage to buildings, roads, and infrastructures.

Abstract: False positives in pedestrian detection remain a challenge that has yet to be
effectively resolved. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Full-stage
Refined Proposal (FRP) algorithm aimed at eliminating these false positives
within a two-stage CNN-based pedestrian detection framework. The main
innovation of this work lies in employing various pedestrian feature
re-evaluation strategies to filter out low-quality pedestrian proposals during
both the training and testing stages. Specifically, in the training phase, the
Training mode FRP algorithm (TFRP) introduces a novel approach for validating
pedestrian proposals to effectively guide the model training process, thereby
constructing a model with strong capabilities for false positive suppression.
During the inference phase, two innovative strategies are implemented: the
Classifier-guided FRP (CFRP) algorithm integrates a pedestrian classifier into
the proposal generation pipeline to yield high-quality proposals through
pedestrian feature evaluation, and the Split-proposal FRP (SFRP) algorithm
vertically divides all proposals, sending both the original and the sub-region
proposals to the subsequent subnetwork to evaluate their confidence scores,
filtering out those with lower sub-region pedestrian confidence scores. As a
result, the proposed algorithm enhances the model's ability to suppress
pedestrian false positives across all stages. Various experiments conducted on
multiple benchmarks and the SY-Metro datasets demonstrate that the model,
supported by different combinations of the FRP algorithm, can effectively
eliminate false positives to varying extents. Furthermore, experiments
conducted on embedded platforms underscore the algorithm's effectiveness in
enhancing the comprehensive pedestrian detection capabilities of the small
pedestrian detector in resource-constrained edge devices.

Conclusion: FWA和LOLViT有效解决了计算效率问题，同时提升了模型性能与速度。

Abstract: Currently, lightweight hybrid backbone networks have partially alleviated the
issue of computational saturation, but the imbalance in computational
efficiencys between convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and attention
mechanisms is becoming increasingly apparent. Specifically, although linear
attention mechanisms and their variants have made progress in lightweight
design, they still fail to meet the demands of hybrid models for long-sequence
modeling. On the other hand, existing lightweight SoftMax attention
computations typically reduce the feature map to a fixed size to decrease the
number of sequences, thereby compressing the computational scale. However, the
process of determining the feature map reduction ratio is cumbersome, and
computational saturation issues still persist. To address this issue, this
paper proposes a lightweight SoftMax attention mechanism with adaptive feature
map sizes, named Fast Window Attention (FWA), which generates a small number of
key sequences (Key and Value) through window aggregation for attention
computation. Additionally, it explains the rationality of using ReLU to
simulate SoftMax operations in lightweight global attention mechanisms.
Finally, the paper designs a global-local feature fusion mechanism and combines
it with GhostNet to propose a lightweight hybrid backbone network, LOLViT.
Through visual tasks such as classification (ImageNet 1K), detection (COCO
2017), and segmentation (BDD100K), along with extensive ablation studies, it is
demonstrated that LOLViT outperforms CNN models of the same level in both
inference speed and model accuracy. Notably, the inference speed of LOLViT-X is
5x that of MobileViT-X.

Motivation: 随着机器人探索任务的复杂性增加，高质量数字地形图（DTMs）的需求日益增长，但传统方法需要大量手动预处理，效率低下。

Method: NTM方法仅需每个图像像素的轨迹，不依赖深度或其他结构先验，通过神经体积渲染技术学习地形图。

Result: 在合成和真实卫星数据（地球和火星）上验证，结果显示地形预测精度接近卫星图像分辨率，即使相机参数不完美。

Conclusion: NTM方法展示了直接从卫星图像生成高质量地形图的潜力，为未来行星探索提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Digital terrain maps (DTMs) are an important part of planetary exploration,
enabling operations such as terrain relative navigation during entry, descent,
and landing for spacecraft and aiding in navigation on the ground. As robotic
exploration missions become more ambitious, the need for high quality DTMs will
only increase. However, producing DTMs via multi-view stereo pipelines for
satellite imagery, the current state-of-the-art, can be cumbersome and require
significant manual image preprocessing to produce satisfactory results. In this
work, we seek to address these shortcomings by adapting neural volume rendering
techniques to learn textured digital terrain maps directly from satellite
imagery. Our method, neural terrain maps (NTM), only requires the locus for
each image pixel and does not rely on depth or any other structural priors. We
demonstrate our method on both synthetic and real satellite data from Earth and
Mars encompassing scenes on the order of $100 \textrm{km}^2$. We evaluate the
accuracy of our output terrain maps by comparing with existing high-quality
DTMs produced using traditional multi-view stereo pipelines. Our method shows
promising results, with the precision of terrain prediction almost equal to the
resolution of the satellite images even in the presence of imperfect camera
intrinsics and extrinsics.

Abstract: Automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) and vehicle make and model
recognition underpin intelligent transportation systems, supporting law
enforcement, toll collection, and post-incident investigation. Applying these
methods to videos captured by handheld smartphones or non-static
vehicle-mounted cameras presents unique challenges compared to fixed
installations, including frequent camera motion, varying viewpoints,
occlusions, and unknown road geometry. Traditional ALPR solutions, dependent on
specialized hardware and handcrafted OCR pipelines, often degrade under these
conditions. Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) enable
direct recognition of textual and semantic attributes from arbitrary imagery.
This study evaluates the potential of VLMs for ALPR and makes and models
recognition using monocular videos captured with handheld smartphones and
non-static mounted cameras. The proposed license plate recognition pipeline
filters to sharp frames, then sends a multimodal prompt to a VLM using several
prompt strategies. Make and model recognition pipeline runs the same VLM with a
revised prompt and an optional self-reflection module. In the self-reflection
module, the model contrasts the query image with a reference from a 134-class
dataset, correcting mismatches. Experiments on a smartphone dataset collected
on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin, achieve top-1 accuracies of
91.67% for ALPR and 66.67% for make and model recognition. On the public
UFPR-ALPR dataset, the approach attains 83.05% and 61.07%, respectively. The
self-reflection module further improves results by 5.72% on average for make
and model recognition. These findings demonstrate that VLMs provide a
cost-effective solution for scalable, in-motion traffic video analysis.

Conclusion: OAPR任务和框架为开放属性识别提供了解决方案，代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) plays a crucial role in various vision
tasks such as person retrieval and identification. Most existing
attribute-based retrieval methods operate under the closed-set assumption that
all attribute classes are consistently available during both training and
inference. However, this assumption limits their applicability in real-world
scenarios where novel attributes may emerge. Moreover, predefined attributes in
benchmark datasets are often generic and shared across individuals, making them
less discriminative for retrieving the target person. To address these
challenges, we propose the Open-Attribute Recognition for Person Retrieval
(OAPR) task, which aims to retrieve individuals based on attribute cues,
regardless of whether those attributes were seen during training. To support
this task, we introduce a novel framework designed to learn generalizable body
part representations that cover a broad range of attribute categories.
Furthermore, we reconstruct four widely used datasets for open-attribute
recognition. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets demonstrate the
necessity of the OAPR task and the effectiveness of our framework. The source
code and pre-trained models will be publicly available upon publication.

Result: 通过频域和空间域协同，有效恢复了RAW图像中丢失的细节。

Conclusion: SFAE框架在RAW图像目标检测中表现出色，为细节恢复提供了新思路。

Abstract: Direct RAW-based object detection offers great promise by utilizing RAW data
(unprocessed sensor data), but faces inherent challenges due to its wide
dynamic range and linear response, which tends to suppress crucial object
details. In particular, existing enhancement methods are almost all performed
in the spatial domain, making it difficult to effectively recover these
suppressed details from the skewed pixel distribution of RAW images. To address
this limitation, we turn to the frequency domain, where features, such as
object contours and textures, can be naturally separated based on frequency. In
this paper, we propose Space-Frequency Aware RAW Image Object Detection
Enhancer (SFAE), a novel framework that synergizes spatial and frequency
representations. Our contribution is threefold. The first lies in the
``spatialization" of frequency bands. Different from the traditional paradigm
of directly manipulating abstract spectra in deep networks, our method
inversely transforms individual frequency bands back into tangible spatial
maps, thus preserving direct physical intuition. Then the cross-domain fusion
attention module is developed to enable deep multimodal interactions between
these maps and the original spatial features. Finally, the framework performs
adaptive nonlinear adjustments by predicting and applying different gamma
parameters for the two domains.

Conclusion: ForenX在检测AI生成图像和提供解释方面表现出色，数据集ForgReason显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Advances in generative models have led to AI-generated images visually
indistinguishable from authentic ones. Despite numerous studies on detecting
AI-generated images with classifiers, a gap persists between such methods and
human cognitive forensic analysis. We present ForenX, a novel method that not
only identifies the authenticity of images but also provides explanations that
resonate with human thoughts. ForenX employs the powerful multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) to analyze and interpret forensic cues. Furthermore, we
overcome the limitations of standard MLLMs in detecting forgeries by
incorporating a specialized forensic prompt that directs the MLLMs attention to
forgery-indicative attributes. This approach not only enhance the
generalization of forgery detection but also empowers the MLLMs to provide
explanations that are accurate, relevant, and comprehensive. Additionally, we
introduce ForgReason, a dataset dedicated to descriptions of forgery evidences
in AI-generated images. Curated through collaboration between an LLM-based
agent and a team of human annotators, this process provides refined data that
further enhances our model's performance. We demonstrate that even limited
manual annotations significantly improve explanation quality. We evaluate the
effectiveness of ForenX on two major benchmarks. The model's explainability is
verified by comprehensive subjective evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RGB-based 3D任务中标注稀缺、昂贵且数据增强工具不足的问题，尤其是传统图像变换会破坏几何一致性的问题。

Method: 提出3DRot，一种即插即用的数据增强方法，通过旋转和镜像图像并同步更新RGB图像、相机内参、物体位姿和3D标注，以保持投影几何一致性。

Result: 在SUN RGB-D数据集上，3DRot显著提升了3D检测任务的性能，包括IoU3D、旋转误差和mAP0.5等指标。

Conclusion: 3DRot是一种高效且可扩展的几何一致数据增强方法，适用于多种3D任务。

Abstract: RGB-based 3D tasks, e.g., 3D detection, depth estimation, 3D keypoint
estimation, still suffer from scarce, expensive annotations and a thin
augmentation toolbox, since most image transforms, including resize and
rotation, disrupt geometric consistency. In this paper, we introduce 3DRot, a
plug-and-play augmentation that rotates and mirrors images about the camera's
optical center while synchronously updating RGB images, camera intrinsics,
object poses, and 3D annotations to preserve projective geometry-achieving
geometry-consistent rotations and reflections without relying on any scene
depth. We validate 3DRot with a classical 3D task, monocular 3D detection. On
SUN RGB-D dataset, 3DRot raises $IoU_{3D}$ from 43.21 to 44.51, cuts rotation
error (ROT) from 22.91$^\circ$ to 20.93$^\circ$, and boosts $mAP_{0.5}$ from
35.70 to 38.11. As a comparison, Cube R-CNN adds 3 other datasets together with
SUN RGB-D for monocular 3D estimation, with a similar mechanism and test
dataset, increases $IoU_{3D}$ from 36.2 to 37.8, boosts $mAP_{0.5}$ from 34.7
to 35.4. Because it operates purely through camera-space transforms, 3DRot is
readily transferable to other 3D tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose SPECTRUM, a temporal-frequency synergistic model
that unlocks the untapped potential of multi-domain representation learning for
online handwriting verification (OHV). SPECTRUM comprises three core
components: (1) a multi-scale interactor that finely combines temporal and
frequency features through dual-modal sequence interaction and multi-scale
aggregation, (2) a self-gated fusion module that dynamically integrates global
temporal and frequency features via self-driven balancing. These two components
work synergistically to achieve micro-to-macro spectral-temporal integration.
(3) A multi-domain distance-based verifier then utilizes both temporal and
frequency representations to improve discrimination between genuine and forged
handwriting, surpassing conventional temporal-only approaches. Extensive
experiments demonstrate SPECTRUM's superior performance over existing OHV
methods, underscoring the effectiveness of temporal-frequency multi-domain
learning. Furthermore, we reveal that incorporating multiple handwritten
biometrics fundamentally enhances the discriminative power of handwriting
representations and facilitates verification. These findings not only validate
the efficacy of multi-domain learning in OHV but also pave the way for future
research in multi-domain approaches across both feature and biometric domains.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) recovery, as an upstream image processing task,
  holds significant importance for downstream tasks such as classification,
  segmentation, and detection. In recent years, HSI recovery methods based on
  non-local prior representations have demonstrated outstanding performance.
However,
  these methods employ a fixed-format factor to represent the non-local
self-similarity
  tensor groups, making them unable to adapt to diverse missing scenarios. To
address
  this issue, we introduce the concept of granularity in tensor decomposition
for the first
  time and propose an HSI recovery model constrained by multi-granularity
non-local
  self-similarity priors. Specifically, the proposed model alternately performs
  coarse-grained decomposition and fine-grained decomposition on the non-local
  self-similarity tensor groups. Among them, the coarse-grained decomposition
builds
  upon Tucker tensor decomposition, which extracts global structural
information of the
  image by performing singular value shrinkage on the mode-unfolded matrices.
The
  fine-grained decomposition employs the FCTN decomposition, capturing local
detail
  information through modeling pairwise correlations among factor tensors. This
  architectural approach achieves a unified representation of global, local,
and non-local
  priors for HSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that the model has strong
  applicability and exhibits outstanding recovery effects in various types of
missing
  scenes such as pixels and stripes.

Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical step in computational biomedical image
analysis, typically evaluated using metrics like the Dice coefficient during
training and validation. However, in clinical settings without manual
annotations, assessing segmentation quality becomes challenging, and models
lacking reliability indicators face adoption barriers. To address this gap, we
propose a novel framework for predicting segmentation quality without requiring
ground truth annotations during test time. Our approach introduces two
complementary frameworks: one leveraging predicted segmentation and uncertainty
maps, and another integrating the original input image, uncertainty maps, and
predicted segmentation maps. We present Bayesian adaptations of two benchmark
segmentation models-SwinUNet and Feature Pyramid Network with ResNet50-using
Monte Carlo Dropout, Ensemble, and Test Time Augmentation to quantify
uncertainty. We evaluate four uncertainty estimates: confidence map, entropy,
mutual information, and expected pairwise Kullback-Leibler divergence on 2D
skin lesion and 3D liver segmentation datasets, analyzing their correlation
with segmentation quality metrics. Our framework achieves an R2 score of 93.25
and Pearson correlation of 96.58 on the HAM10000 dataset, outperforming
previous segmentation quality assessment methods. For 3D liver segmentation,
Test Time Augmentation with entropy achieves an R2 score of 85.03 and a Pearson
correlation of 65.02, demonstrating cross-modality robustness. Additionally, we
propose an aggregation strategy that combines multiple uncertainty estimates
into a single score per image, offering a more robust and comprehensive
assessment of segmentation quality. Finally, we use Grad-CAM and UMAP-based
embedding analysis to interpret the model's behavior and reliability,
highlighting the impact of uncertainty integration.

Abstract: 3D generation has made significant progress, however, it still largely
remains at the object-level. Feedforward 3D scene-level generation has been
rarely explored due to the lack of models capable of scaling-up latent
representation learning on 3D scene-level data. Unlike object-level generative
models, which are trained on well-labeled 3D data in a bounded canonical space,
scene-level generations with 3D scenes represented by 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) are unbounded and exhibit scale inconsistency across different scenes,
making unified latent representation learning for generative purposes extremely
challenging. In this paper, we introduce Can3Tok, the first 3D scene-level
variational autoencoder (VAE) capable of encoding a large number of Gaussian
primitives into a low-dimensional latent embedding, which effectively captures
both semantic and spatial information of the inputs. Beyond model design, we
propose a general pipeline for 3D scene data processing to address scale
inconsistency issue. We validate our method on the recent scene-level 3D
dataset DL3DV-10K, where we found that only Can3Tok successfully generalizes to
novel 3D scenes, while compared methods fail to converge on even a few hundred
scene inputs during training and exhibit zero generalization ability during
inference. Finally, we demonstrate image-to-3DGS and text-to-3DGS generation as
our applications to demonstrate its ability to facilitate downstream generation
tasks.

Motivation: 脑肿瘤分割因肿瘤异质性和计算成本高而具有挑战性，需高效准确的方法。

Result: 在MSD Task01和BraTS 2021数据集上达到SOTA，减少内存和推理时间。

Conclusion: EfficientGFormer为临床提供了快速、准确且可扩展的肿瘤分割方案。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient brain tumor segmentation remains a critical challenge
in neuroimaging due to the heterogeneous nature of tumor subregions and the
high computational cost of volumetric inference. In this paper, we propose
EfficientGFormer, a novel architecture that integrates pretrained foundation
models with graph-based reasoning and lightweight efficiency mechanisms for
robust 3D brain tumor segmentation. Our framework leverages nnFormer as a
modality-aware encoder, transforming multi-modal MRI volumes into patch-level
embeddings. These features are structured into a dual-edge graph that captures
both spatial adjacency and semantic similarity. A pruned, edge-type-aware Graph
Attention Network (GAT) enables efficient relational reasoning across tumor
subregions, while a distillation module transfers knowledge from a
full-capacity teacher to a compact student model for real-time deployment.
Experiments on the MSD Task01 and BraTS 2021 datasets demonstrate that
EfficientGFormer achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with significantly reduced
memory and inference time, outperforming recent transformer-based and
graph-based baselines. This work offers a clinically viable solution for fast
and accurate volumetric tumor delineation, combining scalability,
interpretability, and generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对已知生成器表现良好，但对新兴或未见生成器的检测性能下降，需要更鲁棒的检测器。

Method: MiraGe通过最小化类内变化和最大化类间分离学习生成器不变特征，并结合多模态提示学习优化CLIP模型。

Result: 在多基准测试中，MiraGe实现了最先进的性能，对未见生成器（如Sora）仍保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MiraGe通过生成器不变特征学习和多模态提示学习，显著提升了AI生成图像检测的泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have highlighted the need for robust
detectors capable of distinguishing real images from AI-generated images. While
existing methods perform well on known generators, their performance often
declines when tested with newly emerging or unseen generative models due to
overlapping feature embeddings that hinder accurate cross-generator
classification. In this paper, we propose Multimodal Discriminative
Representation Learning for Generalizable AI-generated Image Detection
(MiraGe), a method designed to learn generator-invariant features. Motivated by
theoretical insights on intra-class variation minimization and inter-class
separation, MiraGe tightly aligns features within the same class while
maximizing separation between classes, enhancing feature discriminability.
Moreover, we apply multimodal prompt learning to further refine these
principles into CLIP, leveraging text embeddings as semantic anchors for
effective discriminative representation learning, thereby improving
generalizability. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show
that MiraGe achieves state-of-the-art performance, maintaining robustness even
against unseen generators like Sora.

Conclusion: 渐进式训练方法使小模型在视频推理任务中表现优异且计算高效。

Abstract: While recent multimodal models have shown progress in vision-language tasks,
small-scale variants still struggle with the fine-grained temporal reasoning
required for video understanding. We introduce ReasonAct, a method that
enhances video reasoning in smaller models through a three-stage training
process: first building a foundation with text-only reasoning, then fine-tuning
on video, and finally refining with temporal-aware reinforcement learning. We
build upon Temporal Group Relative Policy Optimization (T-GRPO) by
incorporating temporal consistency modeling into policy optimization. We also
propose a biomechanically-motivated sub-action decomposition mechanism that
provides graduated rewards for constituent action phases. Through experiments
on HMDB51, UCF-101, and Kinetics-400, our 3B-parameter model achieves 67.2%,
94.1%, and 78.9% accuracy respectively, demonstrating improvements of 17.9,
15.8, and 12.3 points over baselines. Ablation studies validate that our
progressive training methodology enables smaller models to achieve competitive
video reasoning performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in
recent years, enabling a diverse array of applications in everyday life.
However, the substantial computational and storage demands of VLMs pose
significant challenges for their efficient deployment on mobile devices, which
represent the most ubiquitous and accessible computing platforms today. In this
work, we introduce MagicVL-2B, a novel VLM meticulously optimized for flagship
smartphones. MagicVL-2B leverages a lightweight visual encoder with fewer than
100M parameters and features a redesigned dynamic resolution scheme that
adaptively generates image tokens without excessive modification of image
dimensions. To further enhance the performance of this compact encoder within
VLMs, we propose a multimodal curriculum learning strategy that incrementally
increases task difficulty and data information density throughout training.
This approach substantially improves the model's performance across a variety
of sub-tasks. Extensive evaluations on standard VLM benchmarks demonstrate that
MagicVL-2B matches the accuracy of current state-of-the-art models while
reducing on-device power consumption by 41.1%. These results establish
MagicVL-2B as a practical and robust solution for real-world mobile
vision-language applications, enabling advanced multimodal intelligence to run
directly on smartphones.

Motivation: 现有视频RAG方法在检索效率和准确性上难以平衡，尤其是处理复杂视频内容时，计算成本高且效果有限。

Method: 提出E-VRAG框架，包括帧预过滤、轻量级VLM评分、全局统计分布检索策略和多视角问答方案。

Result: 在四个公开基准测试中，E-VRAG减少约70%计算成本，且准确性高于基线方法。

Conclusion: E-VRAG无需额外训练即可显著提升视频RAG任务的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled substantial progress in video
understanding by leveraging cross-modal reasoning capabilities. However, their
effectiveness is limited by the restricted context window and the high
computational cost required to process long videos with thousands of frames.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this challenge by selecting only
the most relevant frames as input, thereby reducing the computational burden.
Nevertheless, existing video RAG methods struggle to balance retrieval
efficiency and accuracy, particularly when handling diverse and complex video
content. To address these limitations, we propose E-VRAG, a novel and efficient
video RAG framework for video understanding. We first apply a frame
pre-filtering method based on hierarchical query decomposition to eliminate
irrelevant frames, reducing computational costs at the data level. We then
employ a lightweight VLM for frame scoring, further reducing computational
costs at the model level. Additionally, we propose a frame retrieval strategy
that leverages the global statistical distribution of inter-frame scores to
mitigate the potential performance degradation from using a lightweight VLM.
Finally, we introduce a multi-view question answering scheme for the retrieved
frames, enhancing the VLM's capability to extract and comprehend information
from long video contexts. Experiments on four public benchmarks show that
E-VRAG achieves about 70% reduction in computational cost and higher accuracy
compared to baseline methods, all without additional training. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of E-VRAG in improving both efficiency and
accuracy for video RAG tasks.

Result: 剪枝92.6%视觉标记，性能与基线相当；增强版GlimpsePrune+性能提升至基线110%。

Conclusion: GlimpsePrune为构建更强大高效的LVLMs提供了新途径。

Abstract: Visual token compression is critical for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
to efficiently process high-resolution inputs. Existing methods that typically
adopt fixed compression ratios cannot adapt to scenes of varying complexity,
often causing imprecise pruning that discards informative visual tokens and
results in degraded model performance. To address this issue, we introduce a
dynamic pruning framework, GlimpsePrune, inspired by human cognition. It takes
a data-driven ''glimpse'' and prunes irrelevant visual tokens in a single
forward pass before answer generation. This approach prunes 92.6% of visual
tokens while on average fully retaining the baseline performance on free-form
VQA tasks. The reduced computational cost also enables more effective
fine-tuning: an enhanced GlimpsePrune+ achieves 110% of the baseline
performance while maintaining a similarly high pruning rate. Our work paves a
new way for building more powerful and efficient LVLMs.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型适应方法依赖人工设计，耗时且需要专业知识，因此需要自动化优化方法。

Method: 采用两阶段LLM辅助进化算法，分阶段优化特征选择和逻辑计算，结合低精度代码转换和基于网络的代码执行以提高搜索效率。

Result: 在8-shot图像分类任务中，EvoVLMA发现的算法比经典APE算法准确率提升1.91个百分点。

Conclusion: EvoVLMA为预训练多模态模型适应算法的自动化优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been exploited in various
Computer Vision tasks (e.g., few-shot recognition) via model adaptation, such
as prompt tuning and adapters. However, existing adaptation methods are
designed by human experts, requiring significant time cost and experience.
Inspired by recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) based code
generation, we propose an Evolutionary Vision-Language Model Adaptation
(EvoVLMA) method to automatically search training-free efficient adaptation
algorithms for VLMs. We recognize feature selection and logits computation as
the key functions in training-free VLM adaptation, and propose a two-stage
LLM-assisted evolutionary algorithm for optimizing these parts in a sequential
manner, effectively addressing the challenge posed by the expansive search
space through a divide-and-conquer strategy. Besides, to enhance the stability
and efficiency of searching process, we propose low-precision code conversion,
web based code execution and process monitoring, leading to a highly effective
automatic algorithm design system. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
algorithms found by EvoVLMA can obtain promising results compared to previous
manually-designed ones. More specifically, in the 8-shot image classification
setting, the classical APE algorithm can be improved by 1.91 points in
recognition accuracy. This research opens new possibilities for automating the
optimization of adaptation algorithms of pre-trained multimodal models. Code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于历史感知的自适应扫描框架，通过预测感兴趣区域（ROI）减少LiDAR冗余扫描，显著降低能耗，同时保持3D物体检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LiDAR传感器在密集扫描时忽略时间连续性，导致冗余和能耗问题，限制了其在资源受限平台上的实用性。

Method: 采用轻量级预测网络和历史上下文嵌入，结合可微分掩码生成器，通过Gumbel-Softmax采样生成ROI掩码，实现自适应扫描。

Result: 在nuScenes和Lyft基准测试中，LiDAR能耗降低65%以上，3D物体检测性能与传统方法相当或更优。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了LiDAR冗余扫描问题，为资源受限平台提供了高效的多传感器融合解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion using LiDAR and RGB cameras significantly enhances 3D
object detection task. However, conventional LiDAR sensors perform dense,
stateless scans, ignoring the strong temporal continuity in real-world scenes.
This leads to substantial sensing redundancy and excessive power consumption,
limiting their practicality on resource-constrained platforms. To address this
inefficiency, we propose a predictive, history-aware adaptive scanning
framework that anticipates informative regions of interest (ROI) based on past
observations. Our approach introduces a lightweight predictor network that
distills historical spatial and temporal contexts into refined query
embeddings. These embeddings guide a differentiable Mask Generator network,
which leverages Gumbel-Softmax sampling to produce binary masks identifying
critical ROIs for the upcoming frame. Our method significantly reduces
unnecessary data acquisition by concentrating dense LiDAR scanning only within
these ROIs and sparsely sampling elsewhere. Experiments on nuScenes and Lyft
benchmarks demonstrate that our adaptive scanning strategy reduces LiDAR energy
consumption by over 65% while maintaining competitive or even superior 3D
object detection performance compared to traditional LiDAR-camera fusion
methods with dense LiDAR scanning.

Motivation: 隐私法规（如GDPR和CCPA）要求用户数据及其对模型的影响完全删除，而现有方法在随机数据遗忘场景中面临挑战。

Method: 通过选择性掩码实验揭示ViTs特性，提出LetheViT方法，利用掩码图像生成正对数，原始图像生成负对数，引导模型遗忘特定数据。

Result: LetheViT在实验中表现出色，实现了隐私合规与模型性能的最佳平衡。

Conclusion: LetheViT为ViTs提供了一种高效的随机数据遗忘解决方案，适用于隐私敏感场景。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized computer vision tasks with
their exceptional performance. However, the introduction of privacy regulations
such as GDPR and CCPA has brought new challenges to them. These laws grant
users the right to withdraw their data, necessitating not only the deletion of
data but also the complete removal of its influence from trained models.
Machine unlearning emerges as a critical solution, with exact unlearning being
computationally prohibitive and approximate methods offering a more practical
approach. This work addresses the particularly challenging scenario of random
data forgetting in ViTs, where the model must forget specific samples while
retaining others, even within the same class. We first reveal the core
characteristics of ViTs through selective masking experiments: when
high-attention areas are masked, the model retains its recognition capability
but significantly weakens its memorization ability. Based on the above
insights, we propose LetheViT, a contrastive unlearning method tailored for
ViTs. LetheViT uses masked image inputs to generate positive logits and
original image inputs to generate negative logits, guiding the model to forget
specific details while retaining the general cl category outlines. Experimental
results demonstrate that LetheViT achieves state-of-the-art performance,
effectively balancing privacy compliance with model efficacy.

<details>

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在图像处理中缺乏对拓扑结构的敏感性，而拓扑结构（如连通性和环路）对理解图像内容（如生物医学对象）至关重要。

Method: 利用持久同调（PH）编码图像局部块的几何和拓扑特征，生成称为TopoImage的多通道图像形式表示，并通过多视角TopoImages进一步丰富表示。

Result: 在三个公开医学图像分类数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: TopoImages方法具有高度通用性，可无缝集成到常见深度学习框架中，为数据分析和分类任务提供了新视角。

Abstract: Topological structures in image data, such as connected components and loops,
play a crucial role in understanding image content (e.g., biomedical objects).
% Despite remarkable successes of numerous image processing methods that rely
on appearance information, these methods often lack sensitivity to topological
structures when used in general deep learning (DL) frameworks. % In this paper,
we introduce a new general approach, called TopoImages (for Topology Images),
which computes a new representation of input images by encoding local topology
of patches. % In TopoImages, we leverage persistent homology (PH) to encode
geometric and topological features inherent in image patches. % Our main
objective is to capture topological information in local patches of an input
image into a vectorized form. % Specifically, we first compute persistence
diagrams (PDs) of the patches, % and then vectorize and arrange these PDs into
long vectors for pixels of the patches. % The resulting multi-channel
image-form representation is called a TopoImage. % TopoImages offers a new
perspective for data analysis. % To garner diverse and significant topological
features in image data and ensure a more comprehensive and enriched
representation, we further generate multiple TopoImages of the input image
using various filtration functions, which we call multi-view TopoImages. % The
multi-view TopoImages are fused with the input image for DL-based
classification, with considerable improvement. % Our TopoImages approach is
highly versatile and can be seamlessly integrated into common DL frameworks.
Experiments on three public medical image classification datasets demonstrate
noticeably improved accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 持续学习模型在任务流中学习时容易遗忘先前知识，而现有的方法未充分利用CLIP模型的文本语义先验来解决稳定性与可塑性的矛盾。

Method: 提出了SECA框架，包括SG-AKT模块（通过文本线索评估新图像与历史知识的语义相关性）和SE-VPR模块（利用文本嵌入优化视觉原型）。

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证了SECA的有效性。

Conclusion: SECA通过结合文本语义先验，显著提升了持续学习模型的性能，解决了稳定性与可塑性的平衡问题。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to equip models with the ability to learn from a
stream of tasks without forgetting previous knowledge. With the progress of
vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP),
their promise for CL has attracted increasing attention due to their strong
generalizability. However, the potential of rich textual semantic priors in
CLIP in addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma remains underexplored.
During backbone training, most approaches transfer past knowledge without
considering semantic relevance, leading to interference from unrelated tasks
that disrupt the balance between stability and plasticity. Besides, while
text-based classifiers provide strong generalization, they suffer from limited
plasticity due to the inherent modality gap in CLIP. Visual classifiers help
bridge this gap, but their prototypes lack rich and precise semantics. To
address these challenges, we propose Semantic-Enriched Continual Adaptation
(SECA), a unified framework that harnesses the anti-forgetting and structured
nature of textual priors to guide semantic-aware knowledge transfer in the
backbone and reinforce the semantic structure of the visual classifier.
Specifically, a Semantic-Guided Adaptive Knowledge Transfer (SG-AKT) module is
proposed to assess new images' relevance to diverse historical visual knowledge
via textual cues, and aggregate relevant knowledge in an instance-adaptive
manner as distillation signals. Moreover, a Semantic-Enhanced Visual Prototype
Refinement (SE-VPR) module is introduced to refine visual prototypes using
inter-class semantic relations captured in class-wise textual embeddings.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our
approach.

<details>

Motivation: 传统领域泛化（DG）假设目标域在训练时不可访问，但视觉基础模型（VFMs）的出现使这一假设过时。需要一种新方法来适应VFMs的广泛数据训练特性。

Method: 提出Set Pivot Learning（SPL），强调动态适应和VFM中心调优，并结合动态提示微调方法（Dynamic Prompt Fine-Tuning），包括动态类感知提示器和提示引导特征聚焦器。

Conclusion: SPL为领域泛化提供了更灵活的框架，适应VFMs的特性，显著提升了模型在动态场景中的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, the concept of Set Pivot
Learning, a paradigm shift that redefines domain generalization (DG) based on
Vision Foundation Models (VFMs). Traditional DG assumes that the target domain
is inaccessible during training, but the emergence of VFMs, trained on vast and
diverse data, renders this assumption unclear and obsolete. Traditional DG
assumes that the target domain is inaccessible during training, but the
emergence of VFMs, which are trained on vast and diverse datasets, renders this
assumption unclear and obsolete. To address this challenge, we propose Set
Pivot Learning (SPL), a new definition of domain migration task based on VFMs,
which is more suitable for current research and application requirements.
Unlike conventional DG methods, SPL prioritizes adaptive refinement over rigid
domain transfer, ensuring continuous alignment with evolving real-world
conditions. Specifically, SPL features two key attributes: (i) Dynamic
adaptation, transitioning from static domain alignment to flexible, task-driven
feature optimization, enabling models to evolve with downstream scenarios; (ii)
VFM-centric tuning, leveraging pretrained knowledge as a pivot to hone
task-specific representations while preserving cross-domain robustness.
Building on SPL, we propose a Dynamic Prompt Fine-Tuning method, which combines
a Dynamic Class-aware Prompter with a Prompt-guided Feature Focuser, to elevate
VFM performance in targeted scenarios. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets show the effectiveness of our method, highlighting its superiority
over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in generalized segmentation.

Motivation: 现有方法在生成随机运动序列时难以学习连续时间动态，且容易忽视复杂人体运动的灵活性，导致模式崩溃。

Result: 在Human3.6M和HumanEva-I数据集上的实验表明，STCN在多样性和准确性上均具有竞争力。

Conclusion: STCN通过两阶段设计和锚点集策略，有效提升了随机人体运动预测的性能。

Abstract: Stochastic Human Motion Prediction (HMP) has received increasing attention
due to its wide applications. Despite the rapid progress in generative fields,
existing methods often face challenges in learning continuous temporal dynamics
and predicting stochastic motion sequences. They tend to overlook the
flexibility inherent in complex human motions and are prone to mode collapse.
To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel method called STCN, for
stochastic and continuous human motion prediction, which consists of two
stages. Specifically, in the first stage, we propose a spatio-temporal
continuous network to generate smoother human motion sequences. In addition,
the anchor set is innovatively introduced into the stochastic HMP task to
prevent mode collapse, which refers to the potential human motion patterns. In
the second stage, STCN endeavors to acquire the Gaussian mixture distribution
(GMM) of observed motion sequences with the aid of the anchor set. It also
focuses on the probability associated with each anchor, and employs the
strategy of sampling multiple sequences from each anchor to alleviate
intra-class differences in human motions. Experimental results on two
widely-used datasets (Human3.6M and HumanEva-I) demonstrate that our model
obtains competitive performance on both diversity and accuracy.

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Pr^2R比现有方法准确率提升4%和6%。

Conclusion: Pr^2R有效平衡了隐私保护和性能提升，为终身学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) aims to incrementally accumulate
knowledge across a sequence of tasks under domain shifts. Recently,
replay-based methods have demonstrated strong effectiveness in LReID by
rehearsing past samples stored in an auxiliary memory. However, storing
historical exemplars raises concerns over data privacy. To avoid this,
exemplar-free approaches attempt to match the distribution of past data without
storing raw samples. Despite being privacy-friendly, these methods often suffer
from performance degradation due to the forgetting of specific past knowledge
representations. To this end, we propose to condense information from
sequential data into the pixel space in the replay memory, enabling
Privacy-Preserving Replay (Pr^2R). More specifically, by distilling the
training characteristics of multiple real images into a single image, the
condensed samples undergo pixel-level changes. This not only protects the
privacy of the original data but also makes the replay samples more
representative for sequential tasks. During the style replay phase, we align
the current domain to the previous one while simultaneously adapting the replay
samples to match the style of the current domain. This dual-alignment strategy
effectively mitigates both class-incremental challenges and forgetting caused
by domain shifts. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the
proposed method significantly improves replay effectiveness while preserving
data privacy. Specifically, Pr^2R achieves 4% and 6% higher accuracy on
sequential tasks compared to the current state-of-the-art and other

TL;DR: SNARM是一种新型工业异常检测框架，通过自参考学习和动态比较测试图像块与自适应选择的参考块，提升异常检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖预训练的正常数据特征，无法动态优化异常检测。SNARM通过自参考学习增强异常判别能力。

Method: 计算测试图像块与训练特征库的“间残差”，利用小残差块作为自生成参考块计算“内残差”，结合Mamba模块动态聚焦异常区域。

Result: 在MVTec AD、MVTec 3D和VisA基准测试中，SNARM在所有指标上均达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: SNARM通过自参考学习和动态导航机制，显著提升了工业异常检测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Self-Navigated Residual Mamba (SNARM), a novel
framework for universal industrial anomaly detection that leverages
``self-referential learning'' within test images to enhance anomaly
discrimination. Unlike conventional methods that depend solely on pre-trained
features from normal training data, SNARM dynamically refines anomaly detection
by iteratively comparing test patches against adaptively selected in-image
references. Specifically, we first compute the ``inter-residuals'' features by
contrasting test image patches with the training feature bank. Patches
exhibiting small-norm residuals (indicating high normality) are then utilized
as self-generated reference patches to compute ``intra-residuals'', amplifying
discriminative signals. These inter- and intra-residual features are
concatenated and fed into a novel Mamba module with multiple heads, which are
dynamically navigated by residual properties to focus on anomalous regions.
Finally, AD results are obtained by aggregating the outputs of a self-navigated
Mamba in an ensemble learning paradigm. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD,
MVTec 3D, and VisA benchmarks demonstrate that SNARM achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance, with notable improvements in all metrics, including
Image-AUROC, Pixel-AURC, PRO, and AP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DMTrack的双适配器架构，用于时空多模态跟踪，包含STMA和PMCA模块，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态跟踪中不同模态间的特征融合问题，提升跟踪性能。

Method: 设计了STMA和PMCA模块，分别用于调整时空特征和渐进式跨模态提示。

Result: 在五个基准测试中达到最优性能，仅需0.93M可训练参数。

Conclusion: DMTrack通过双适配器设计实现了高效的多模态跟踪。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore adapter tuning and introduce a novel dual-adapter
architecture for spatio-temporal multimodal tracking, dubbed DMTrack. The key
of our DMTrack lies in two simple yet effective modules, including a
spatio-temporal modality adapter (STMA) and a progressive modality
complementary adapter (PMCA) module. The former, applied to each modality
alone, aims to adjust spatio-temporal features extracted from a frozen backbone
by self-prompting, which to some extent can bridge the gap between different
modalities and thus allows better cross-modality fusion. The latter seeks to
facilitate cross-modality prompting progressively with two specially designed
pixel-wise shallow and deep adapters. The shallow adapter employs shared
parameters between the two modalities, aiming to bridge the information flow
between the two modality branches, thereby laying the foundation for following
modality fusion, while the deep adapter modulates the preliminarily fused
information flow with pixel-wise inner-modal attention and further generates
modality-aware prompts through pixel-wise inter-modal attention. With such
designs, DMTrack achieves promising spatio-temporal multimodal tracking
performance with merely \textbf{0.93M} trainable parameters. Extensive
experiments on five benchmarks show that DMTrack achieves state-of-the-art
results. Code will be available.

Motivation: 解决连续手语识别（CSLR）中的技术挑战，特别是跨用户泛化问题，以提升系统对不同用户的适应性。

Method: 采用数据驱动方法，包括特征选择、预处理（DBSCAN异常过滤和空间归一化）和新型CSLRConformer架构（基于CNN-Transformer混合设计）。

Result: 在开发集和测试集上分别达到5.60%和12.01%的词错误率（WER），竞赛排名第三。

Conclusion: 验证了跨领域架构适应的有效性，Conformer模型在手语识别中表现优异，成为新的技术标杆。

Abstract: The field of Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) poses substantial
technical challenges, including fluid inter-sign transitions, the absence of
temporal boundaries, and co-articulation effects. This paper, developed for the
MSLR 2025 Workshop Challenge at ICCV 2025, addresses the critical challenge of
signer-independent recognition to advance the generalization capabilities of
CSLR systems across diverse signers. A data-centric methodology is proposed,
centered on systematic feature engineering, a robust preprocessing pipeline,
and an optimized model architecture. Key contributions include a principled
feature selection process guided by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to isolate
communicative keypoints, a rigorous preprocessing pipeline incorporating
DBSCAN-based outlier filtering and spatial normalization, and the novel
CSLRConformer architecture. This architecture adapts the hybrid CNN-Transformer
design of the Conformer model, leveraging its capacity to model local temporal
dependencies and global sequence context; a characteristic uniquely suited for
the spatio-temporal dynamics of sign language. The proposed methodology
achieved a competitive performance, with a Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.60% on
the development set and 12.01% on the test set, a result that secured a 3rd
place ranking on the official competition platform. This research validates the
efficacy of cross-domain architectural adaptation, demonstrating that the
Conformer model, originally conceived for speech recognition, can be
successfully repurposed to establish a new state-of-the-art performance in
keypoint-based CSLR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态医学数据常因类别不平衡问题难以充分学习少数类特征，现有方法易过拟合或欠拟合且无法捕捉跨模态交互。

Method: 设计了多模态课程测量器和类别分布引导的训练调度器，逐步适应不平衡类别分布。

Result: 在多个多模态医学数据集上的实验表明，CLIMD优于现有方法，尤其擅长处理不平衡数据。

Conclusion: CLIMD作为一种即插即用框架，可轻松集成到其他模型中，提升多模态疾病诊断准确性。

Abstract: Clinicians usually combine information from multiple sources to achieve the
most accurate diagnosis, and this has sparked increasing interest in leveraging
multimodal deep learning for diagnosis. However, in real clinical scenarios,
due to differences in incidence rates, multimodal medical data commonly face
the issue of class imbalance, which makes it difficult to adequately learn the
features of minority classes. Most existing methods tackle this issue with
resampling or loss reweighting, but they are prone to overfitting or
underfitting and fail to capture cross-modal interactions. Therefore, we
propose a Curriculum Learning framework for Imbalanced Multimodal Diagnosis
(CLIMD). Specifically, we first design multimodal curriculum measurer that
combines two indicators, intra-modal confidence and inter-modal
complementarity, to enable the model to focus on key samples and gradually
adapt to complex category distributions. Additionally, a class
distribution-guided training scheduler is introduced, which enables the model
to progressively adapt to the imbalanced class distribution during training.
Extensive experiments on multiple multimodal medical datasets demonstrate that
the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across various
metrics and excels in handling imbalanced multimodal medical data. Furthermore,
as a plug-and-play CL framework, CLIMD can be easily integrated into other
models, offering a promising path for improving multimodal disease diagnosis
accuracy. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/KHan-UJS/CLIMD.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法难以平衡主题和风格，且需要额外训练或涉及复杂超参数。

Method: 提出EST-LoRA，结合矩阵能量、风格差异分数和时间步长，类似MoE架构自适应选择LoRA。

Result: 实验表明EST-LoRA在质量和速度上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EST-LoRA无需训练，高效平衡主题和风格生成，性能优越。

Abstract: Fine-tuning models via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) demonstrates remarkable
performance in subject-driven or style-driven generation tasks. Studies have
explored combinations of different LoRAs to jointly generate learned styles and
content. However, current methods struggle to balance the original subject and
style, and often require additional training. Recently, K-LoRA proposed a
training-free LoRA fusion method. But it involves multiple hyperparameters,
making it difficult to adapt to all styles and subjects. In this paper, we
propose EST-LoRA, a training-free adaptive LoRA fusion method. It
comprehensively considers three critical factors: \underline{E}nergy of matrix,
\underline{S}tyle discrepancy scores and \underline{T}ime steps. Analogous to
the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, the model adaptively selects between
subject LoRA and style LoRA within each attention layer. This integrated
selection mechanism ensures balanced contributions from both components during
the generation process. Experimental results show that EST-LoRA outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations and
achieves faster generation speed compared to other efficient fusion approaches.

Motivation: 脑肿瘤亚型分类因形态学差异细微且标注数据稀缺而极具挑战性，现有视觉语言模型在细粒度特征捕捉上表现不足。

Method: FG-PAN包含两个模块：局部特征优化模块（增强视觉特征）和细粒度文本描述生成模块（利用大语言模型生成语义原型），通过视觉与语义特征对齐提升分类效果。

Result: 在多个公共病理数据集（如EBRAINS和TCGA）上，FG-PAN实现了零样本脑肿瘤亚型分类的最先进性能和鲁棒泛化能力。

Conclusion: FG-PAN通过结合视觉与语义特征对齐，显著提升了细粒度脑肿瘤亚型分类的零样本性能。

Abstract: The fine-grained classification of brain tumor subtypes from
histopathological whole slide images is highly challenging due to subtle
morphological variations and the scarcity of annotated data. Although
vision-language models have enabled promising zero-shot classification, their
ability to capture fine-grained pathological features remains limited,
resulting in suboptimal subtype discrimination. To address these challenges, we
propose the Fine-Grained Patch Alignment Network (FG-PAN), a novel zero-shot
framework tailored for digital pathology. FG-PAN consists of two key modules:
(1) a local feature refinement module that enhances patch-level visual features
by modeling spatial relationships among representative patches, and (2) a
fine-grained text description generation module that leverages large language
models to produce pathology-aware, class-specific semantic prototypes. By
aligning refined visual features with LLM-generated fine-grained descriptions,
FG-PAN effectively increases class separability in both visual and semantic
spaces. Extensive experiments on multiple public pathology datasets, including
EBRAINS and TCGA, demonstrate that FG-PAN achieves state-of-the-art performance
and robust generalization in zero-shot brain tumor subtype classification.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）存在模态偏见，导致对象幻觉问题，并提出一种无需训练的注意力调整方法以缓解此问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs在理解多模态内容时表现出对象幻觉，传统研究认为这是由于视觉编码器与大型语言模型（LLMs）规模不匹配导致的。然而，本文发现LVLMs在幻觉过程中可能同时忽略视觉和文本模态，即模态偏见。

Method: 通过调整视觉和文本标记的注意力权重，平衡跨模态兼容性，并结合对比解码策略减少对参数知识的依赖。

Result: 实验证实模态偏见广泛存在于LVLMs中，所提方法显著缓解了多个开源LVLMs和基准测试中的幻觉问题。

Conclusion: 该方法无需训练，通用性强，能有效提升LVLMs的多模态理解能力。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal
comprehension and reasoning capabilities, but they still suffer from severe
object hallucination. Previous studies primarily attribute the flaw to
linguistic prior caused by the scale mismatch between visual encoders and large
language models (LLMs) in LVLMs. Specifically, as current LVLMs are built upon
LLMs, they tend to over-rely on textual prompts and internal knowledge of LLMs,
generating descriptions inconsistent with visual cues. However, through an
in-depth investigation of the hallucinated mechanisms, we empirically reveal a
previously overlooked phenomenon: LVLMs may ignore not only visual information
but also textual modality during hallucination, a behavior termed as modality
bias, which indicates that LVLMs struggle to simultaneously attend to both
visual and textual modalities, leading to fragmented understanding of
user-provided instructions. Based on this observation, we propose a simple yet
effective training-free method to mitigate object hallucination. Concretely, we
intervene and adjust the attention weights of textual and visual tokens,
balancing cross-modal compatibility for better alignment with user intentions.
Furthermore, we adopt a contrastive decoding strategy to reduce the LVLM's
overreliance on its parametric knowledge, synergistically enhancing our
attention manipulation. Extensive experiments confirm the widespread presence
of modality bias in LVLMs. Notably, our method effectively mitigates
hallucination across multiple open-source LVLMs and benchmarks, highlighting
its generalizability and efficacy.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法在未见过的生成器上泛化能力不足，需提升检测模型的适应性。

Method: IAPL包含条件信息学习器和置信驱动自适应预测模块，动态调整输入图像的提示。

Result: 在UniversalFakeDetect和GenImage数据集上分别达到95.61%和96.7%的平均准确率。

Conclusion: IAPL通过自适应机制显著提升了检测性能，适用于多样化伪造图像。

Abstract: A major struggle for AI-generated image detection is identifying fake images
from unseen generators. Existing cutting-edge methods typically customize
pre-trained foundation models to this task via partial-parameter fine-tuning.
However, these parameters trained on a narrow range of generators may fail to
generalize to unknown sources. In light of this, we propose a novel framework
named Image-Adaptive Prompt Learning (IAPL), which enhances flexibility in
processing diverse testing images. It consists of two adaptive modules, i.e.,
the Conditional Information Learner and the Confidence-Driven Adaptive
Prediction. The former employs CNN-based feature extractors to learn
forgery-specific and image-specific conditions, which are then propagated to
learnable tokens via a gated mechanism. The latter optimizes the shallowest
learnable tokens based on a single test sample and selects the cropped view
with the highest prediction confidence for final detection. These two modules
enable the prompts fed into the foundation model to be automatically adjusted
based on the input image, rather than being fixed after training, thereby
enhancing the model's adaptability to various forged images. Extensive
experiments show that IAPL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 95.61%
and 96.7% mean accuracy on two widely used UniversalFakeDetect and GenImage
datasets, respectively.

Method: 使用IMAGEO-Bench基准，包含三个多样化数据集，评估10种先进LLMs的性能，分析其推理过程和地理偏差。

Result: 闭源模型表现更优，但存在地理偏见，高资源地区（如北美、西欧）表现更好。成功定位依赖于识别城市环境、户外场景和地标。

Conclusion: IMAGEO-Bench为LLMs的空间推理能力提供了严谨评估，并为构建地理感知AI系统提供了启示。

Abstract: Image geolocalization, the task of identifying the geographic location
depicted in an image, is important for applications in crisis response, digital
forensics, and location-based intelligence. While recent advances in large
language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for visual reasoning, their
ability to perform image geolocalization remains underexplored. In this study,
we introduce a benchmark called IMAGEO-Bench that systematically evaluates
accuracy, distance error, geospatial bias, and reasoning process. Our benchmark
includes three diverse datasets covering global street scenes, points of
interest (POIs) in the United States, and a private collection of unseen
images. Through experiments on 10 state-of-the-art LLMs, including both open-
and closed-source models, we reveal clear performance disparities, with
closed-source models generally showing stronger reasoning. Importantly, we
uncover geospatial biases as LLMs tend to perform better in high-resource
regions (e.g., North America, Western Europe, and California) while exhibiting
degraded performance in underrepresented areas. Regression diagnostics
demonstrate that successful geolocalization is primarily dependent on
recognizing urban settings, outdoor environments, street-level imagery, and
identifiable landmarks. Overall, IMAGEO-Bench provides a rigorous lens into the
spatial reasoning capabilities of LLMs and offers implications for building
geolocation-aware AI systems.

Conclusion: LLaDA-MedV在生物医学图像理解任务中表现出色，能够生成更长的响应，提供更丰富的信息，同时揭示了训练和推理阶段的关键因素。

Abstract: Autoregressive models (ARMs) have long dominated the landscape of biomedical
vision-language models (VLMs). Recently, masked diffusion models such as LLaDA
have emerged as promising alternatives, yet their application in the biomedical
domain remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\textbf{LLaDA-MedV}, the first large language diffusion model tailored for
biomedical image understanding through vision instruction tuning. LLaDA-MedV
achieves relative performance gains of 7.855\% over LLaVA-Med and 1.867\% over
LLaDA-V in the open-ended biomedical visual conversation task, and sets new
state-of-the-art accuracy on the closed-form subset of three VQA benchmarks:
84.93\% on VQA-RAD, 92.31\% on SLAKE, and 95.15\% on PathVQA. Furthermore, a
detailed comparison with LLaVA-Med suggests that LLaDA-MedV is capable of
generating reasonably longer responses by explicitly controlling response
length, which can lead to more informative outputs. We also conduct an in-depth
analysis of both the training and inference stages, highlighting the critical
roles of initialization weight selection, fine-tuning strategies, and the
interplay between sampling steps and response repetition. The code and model
weight is released at https://github.com/LLM-VLM-GSL/LLaDA-MedV.

Motivation: G-PCC标准虽然通用且低功耗，但压缩效率不及深度学习方法，需提升其效率而不牺牲兼容性。

Method: 集成压缩导向的体素化网络与可微G-PCC代理模型，联合优化训练，实现端到端梯度传播。

Result: 实验显示平均BD-rate降低38.84%，且无需修改解码器。

Conclusion: 该框架为增强传统压缩标准提供了实用路径，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Geometry-based point cloud compression (G-PCC), an international standard
designed by MPEG, provides a generic framework for compressing diverse types of
point clouds while ensuring interoperability across applications and devices.
However, G-PCC underperforms compared to recent deep learning-based PCC methods
despite its lower computational power consumption. To enhance the efficiency of
G-PCC without sacrificing its interoperability or computational flexibility, we
propose a novel preprocessing framework that integrates a compression-oriented
voxelization network with a differentiable G-PCC surrogate model, jointly
optimized in the training phase. The surrogate model mimics the rate-distortion
behaviour of the non-differentiable G-PCC codec, enabling end-to-end gradient
propagation. The versatile voxelization network adaptively transforms input
point clouds using learning-based voxelization and effectively manipulates
point clouds via global scaling, fine-grained pruning, and point-level editing
for rate-distortion trade-offs. During inference, only the lightweight
voxelization network is appended to the G-PCC encoder, requiring no
modifications to the decoder, thus introducing no computational overhead for
end users. Extensive experiments demonstrate a 38.84% average BD-rate reduction
over G-PCC. By bridging classical codecs with deep learning, this work offers a
practical pathway to enhance legacy compression standards while preserving
their backward compatibility, making it ideal for real-world deployment.

Abstract: We address the problem of glass surface segmentation with an RGB-D camera,
with a focus on effectively fusing RGB and depth information. To this end, we
propose a Weighted Feature Fusion (WFF) module that dynamically and adaptively
combines RGB and depth features to tackle issues such as transparency,
reflections, and occlusions. This module can be seamlessly integrated with
various deep neural network backbones as a plug-and-play solution.
Additionally, we introduce the MJU-Glass dataset, a comprehensive RGB-D dataset
collected by a service robot navigating real-world environments, providing a
valuable benchmark for evaluating segmentation models. Experimental results
show significant improvements in segmentation accuracy and robustness, with the
WFF module enhancing performance in both mean Intersection over Union (mIoU)
and boundary IoU (bIoU), achieving a 7.49% improvement in bIoU when integrated
with PSPNet. The proposed module and dataset provide a robust framework for
advancing glass surface segmentation in robotics and reducing the risk of

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决WSI分析中由于域差距和冗余补丁导致的性能下降和训练成本高的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段选择性采样策略和局部到全局网络，仅需少量高分辨率补丁即可重建WSI表示。

Result: 在多个数据集上，CDSR在分类任务中准确率和ROC曲线下面积分别提高了6.3%和5.5%，且仅需少量补丁。

Conclusion: CDSR在效率和形态保真度上优于现有方法，显著提升了WSI分析的性能。

Abstract: Whole-slide image (WSI) analysis remains challenging due to the gigapixel
scale and sparsely distributed diagnostic regions. Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL) mitigates this by modeling the WSI as bags of patches for slide-level
prediction. However, most MIL approaches emphasize aggregator design while
overlooking the impact of the feature extractor of the feature extraction
stage, which is often pretrained on natural images. This leads to domain gap
and suboptimal representations. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown
promise in bridging domain gap via pretext tasks, but it still primarily builds
upon generic backbones, thus requiring WSIs to be split into small patches.
This inevitably splits histological structures and generates both redundant and
interdependent patches, which in turn degrades aggregator performance and
drastically increases training costs. To address this challenge, we propose a
Cascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction (CDSR) framework, demonstrating that only an
average of 9 high-resolution patches per WSI are sufficient for robust
slide-level representation. CDSR employs a two-stage selective sampling
strategy that identifies the most informative representative regions from both
model-based and semantic perspectives. These patches are then fed into a
Local-to-Global Network, which reconstructs spatially coherent high-resolution
WSI representations by integrating fine-grained local detail with global
contextual information. Unlike existing dense-sampling or SSL pipelines, CDSR
is optimized for efficiency and morphological fidelity. Experiments on
Camelyon16, TCGA-NSCLC, and TCGA-RCC demonstrate that CDSR achieves
improvements of 6.3% in accuracy and 5.5% in area under ROC curve on downstream
classification tasks with only 7,070 (4.5% of total) high-resolution patches
per dataset on average, outperforming state-of-the-art methods trained on over
10,000,000 patches.

Abstract: Realistic hair strand generation is crucial for applications like computer
graphics and virtual reality. While diffusion models can generate hairstyles
from text or images, these inputs lack precision and user-friendliness.
Instead, we propose the first sketch-based strand generation model, which
offers finer control while remaining user-friendly. Our framework tackles key
challenges, such as modeling complex strand interactions and diverse sketch
patterns, through two main innovations: a learnable strand upsampling strategy
that encodes 3D strands into multi-scale latent spaces, and a multi-scale
adaptive conditioning mechanism using a transformer with diffusion heads to
ensure consistency across granularity levels. Experiments on several benchmark
datasets show our method outperforms existing approaches in realism and
precision. Qualitative results further confirm its effectiveness. Code will be

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于扩散模型的3D物体可供性预测方法DAG，通过利用文本到图像扩散模型的内部表示，解决了现有方法泛化能力差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过学习演示图像预测3D物体的可触摸区域，但未能捕捉到图像中的通用可供性知识，导致泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出DAG框架，利用文本到图像扩散模型的冻结内部表示，结合可供性块和多源可供性解码器，实现3D密集可供性预测。

Result: 实验表明，DAG优于现有方法，并展现出开放世界的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DAG通过扩散模型的内部表示成功提取了通用可供性知识，为3D可供性预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: 3D object affordance grounding aims to predict the touchable regions on a 3d
object, which is crucial for human-object interaction, human-robot interaction,
embodied perception, and robot learning. Recent advances tackle this problem
via learning from demonstration images. However, these methods fail to capture
the general affordance knowledge within the image, leading to poor
generalization. To address this issue, we propose to use text-to-image
diffusion models to extract the general affordance knowledge because we find
that such models can generate semantically valid HOI images, which demonstrate
that their internal representation space is highly correlated with real-world
affordance concepts. Specifically, we introduce the DAG, a diffusion-based 3d
affordance grounding framework, which leverages the frozen internal
representations of the text-to-image diffusion model and unlocks affordance
knowledge within the diffusion model to perform 3D affordance grounding. We
further introduce an affordance block and a multi-source affordance decoder to
endow 3D dense affordance prediction. Extensive experimental evaluations show
that our model excels over well-established methods and exhibits open-world
generalization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MAP的训练无关解码方法，通过注意力机制改进大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）中的幻觉问题，提升事实一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLM在多模态任务中表现优异，但仍存在幻觉问题，即生成内容与视觉输入不一致。

Method: 采用Layer-Wise Criss-Cross Attention和Global-Local Logit Fusion机制，通过注意力操作聚合跨层和层内信息。

Result: 在POPE、MME和MMHal-Bench等基准测试中，MAP显著提升了模型的真实性和性能。

Conclusion: MAP通过地图级解码策略有效缓解了LVLM的幻觉问题，展示了其潜力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance in
multimodal tasks, but they still suffer from hallucinations, i.e., generating
content that is grammatically accurate but inconsistent with visual inputs. In
this work, we introduce a novel map-level perspective to mitigate
hallucinations in LVLMs, interpreting the hidden states of the model as a 2D
semantic map. We observe that factual information is widely distributed across
this map, extending beyond the localized inter- or intra-layer regions targeted
by most existing methods (e.g., contrastive decoding and layer-wise
consistency). Building on this insight, we propose Map-Level Attention
Processing (MAP), a training-free decoding method that effectively leverages
factual information through attention-based map-level operations to improve
factual consistency. Specifically, we employ Layer-Wise Criss-Cross Attention
to progressively refine token representations at each decoding layer by
aggregating tokens from both inter- and intra-layer dimensions. Additionally, a
Global-Local Logit Fusion mechanism combines logits obtained before and after
global attention to further refine predictions and improve accuracy. Our method
consistently improves the truthfulness and performance of LVLMs across
benchmarks, such as POPE, MME, and MMHal-Bench, demonstrating the potential of
the map-level decoding strategy.

*Zhixuan Li,Yujia Liu,Chen Hui,Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VELA是一种基于点提示的端到端速度驱动水平集方法，用于显式轮廓演化的无模态分割，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖强提示（如可见掩码或边界框），成本高且不实用；同时缺乏几何可解释性。

Method: VELA通过点提示构建初始水平集函数，并预测形状特定运动场驱动轮廓演化。

Result: 在COCOA-cls、D2SA和KINS基准测试中表现优异，仅需单点提示。

Conclusion: VELA验证了弱提示下可解释几何建模的有效性，代码将公开。

Abstract: Amodal segmentation aims to recover complete object shapes, including
occluded regions with no visual appearance, whereas conventional segmentation
focuses solely on visible areas. Existing methods typically rely on strong
prompts, such as visible masks or bounding boxes, which are costly or
impractical to obtain in real-world settings. While recent approaches such as
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) support point-based prompts for guidance, they
often perform direct mask regression without explicitly modeling shape
evolution, limiting generalization in complex occlusion scenarios. Moreover,
most existing methods suffer from a black-box nature, lacking geometric
interpretability and offering limited insight into how occluded shapes are
inferred. To deal with these limitations, we propose VELA, an end-to-end
VElocity-driven Level-set Amodal segmentation method that performs explicit
contour evolution from point-based prompts. VELA first constructs an initial
level set function from image features and the point input, which then
progressively evolves into the final amodal mask under the guidance of a
shape-specific motion field predicted by a fully differentiable network. This
network learns to generate evolution dynamics at each step, enabling
geometrically grounded and topologically flexible contour modeling. Extensive
experiments on COCOA-cls, D2SA, and KINS benchmarks demonstrate that VELA
outperforms existing strongly prompted methods while requiring only a
single-point prompt, validating the effectiveness of interpretable geometric
modeling under weak guidance. The code will be publicly released.

TL;DR: ShapeMoE是一个基于形状的稀疏混合专家框架，用于改进模态分割任务，通过动态路由对象到特定形状专家，显著提升了遮挡区域的分割效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的一体化方法在处理多样化的模态形状时表现有限，因为单一模型难以捕捉和推理复杂的形状变化。

Method: ShapeMoE通过学习潜在形状分布空间，动态将对象路由到轻量级专家，每个专家专注于特定形状模式的遮挡区域预测。

Result: 在COCOA-cls、KINS和D2SA数据集上，ShapeMoE显著优于现有方法，尤其在遮挡区域分割方面。

Conclusion: ShapeMoE通过形状感知的专家路由，实现了高效且高容量的模态分割，同时保持了良好的可解释性。

Abstract: Amodal segmentation targets to predict complete object masks, covering both
visible and occluded regions. This task poses significant challenges due to
complex occlusions and extreme shape variation, from rigid furniture to highly
deformable clothing. Existing one-size-fits-all approaches rely on a single
model to handle all shape types, struggling to capture and reason about diverse
amodal shapes due to limited representation capacity. A natural solution is to
adopt a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework, assigning experts to different
shape patterns. However, naively applying MoE without considering the object's
underlying shape distribution can lead to mismatched expert routing and
insufficient expert specialization, resulting in redundant or underutilized
experts. To deal with these issues, we introduce ShapeMoE, a shape-specific
sparse Mixture-of-Experts framework for amodal segmentation. The key idea is to
learn a latent shape distribution space and dynamically route each object to a
lightweight expert tailored to its shape characteristics. Specifically,
ShapeMoE encodes each object into a compact Gaussian embedding that captures
key shape characteristics. A Shape-Aware Sparse Router then maps the object to
the most suitable expert, enabling precise and efficient shape-aware expert
routing. Each expert is designed as lightweight and specialized in predicting
occluded regions for specific shape patterns. ShapeMoE offers well
interpretability via clear shape-to-expert correspondence, while maintaining
high capacity and efficiency. Experiments on COCOA-cls, KINS, and D2SA show
that ShapeMoE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in
occluded region segmentation. The code will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rein++是一个基于视觉基础模型(VFM)的高效语义分割框架，通过域泛化(Rein-G)和域适应(Rein-A)解决数据规模差异和域分布偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义分割任务中，数据规模小和域分布偏移限制了视觉基础模型的应用。

Method: Rein++结合Rein-G（实例感知令牌优化特征）和Rein-A（实例和逻辑级别的无监督域适应），并利用Segment Anything模型增强边界细节。

Result: Rein++在高效训练下显著优于现有方法，适用于大规模模型。

Conclusion: Rein++是一个高效、泛化性强且适应性强的VFM分割解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Foundation Models(VFMs) have achieved remarkable success in various
computer vision tasks. However, their application to semantic segmentation is
hindered by two significant challenges: (1) the disparity in data scale, as
segmentation datasets are typically much smaller than those used for VFM
pre-training, and (2) domain distribution shifts, where real-world segmentation
scenarios are diverse and often underrepresented during pre-training. To
overcome these limitations, we present Rein++, an efficient VFM-based
segmentation framework that demonstrates superior generalization from limited
data and enables effective adaptation to diverse unlabeled scenarios.
Specifically, Rein++ comprises a domain generalization solution Rein-G and a
domain adaptation solution Rein-A. Rein-G introduces a set of trainable,
instance-aware tokens that effectively refine the VFM's features for the
segmentation task. This parameter-efficient approach fine-tunes less than 1% of
the backbone's parameters, enabling robust generalization. Building on the
Rein-G, Rein-A performs unsupervised domain adaptation at both the instance and
logit levels to mitigate domain shifts. In addition, it incorporates a semantic
transfer module that leverages the class-agnostic capabilities of the segment
anything model to enhance boundary details in the target domain. The integrated
Rein++ pipeline first learns a generalizable model on a source domain (e.g.,
daytime scenes) and subsequently adapts it to diverse target domains (e.g.,
nighttime scenes) without any target labels. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that Rein++ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with
efficient training, underscoring its roles an efficient, generalizable, and
adaptive segmentation solution for VFMs, even for large models with billions of
parameters. The code is available at https://github.com/wloves/Rein.

TL;DR: PatchMap是首个空间详尽的补丁放置基准，揭示了小补丁在特定区域能显著降低模型置信度，并提出了一种无需梯度查询的分割引导放置方法，显著提高了攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗性补丁攻击威胁现代视觉模型的可靠性，需要研究补丁放置对模型的影响。

Method: 通过评估1.5亿次前向传播构建PatchMap基准，提出基于分割的放置启发式方法。

Result: PatchMap揭示了补丁放置的热点区域，新方法将攻击成功率提高了8-13个百分点。

Conclusion: PatchMap及其方法为位置感知防御和自适应攻击研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks threaten the reliability of modern vision models.
We present PatchMap, the first spatially exhaustive benchmark of patch
placement, built by evaluating over 1.5e8 forward passes on ImageNet validation
images. PatchMap reveals systematic hot-spots where small patches (as little as
2% of the image) induce confident misclassifications and large drops in model
confidence. To demonstrate its utility, we propose a simple segmentation guided
placement heuristic that leverages off the shelf masks to identify vulnerable
regions without any gradient queries. Across five architectures-including
adversarially trained ResNet50, our method boosts attack success rates by 8 to
13 percentage points compared to random or fixed placements. We publicly
release PatchMap and the code implementation. The full PatchMap bench (6.5B
predictions, multiple backbones) will be released soon to further accelerate
research on location-aware defenses and adaptive attacks.

*Zhaochen Wang,Yiwei Wang,Yujun Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prompt-in-Image方法将文本指令嵌入图像，统一视觉通道处理，显著提升Qwen2.5-VL性能，但导致LLaVA-1.5和InstructBLIP性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型（VLMs）因多模态信息对齐问题导致的幻觉现象。

Method: 提出Prompt-in-Image方法，将文本指令直接嵌入图像，强制模型通过视觉通道处理所有内容。

Result: Qwen2.5-VL的POPE准确率提升4.1%，幻觉率降低；LLaVA-1.5和InstructBLIP性能大幅下降。

Conclusion: Prompt-in-Image通过单模态信息处理减少模态差距，提升跨模态对齐效果，但效果因模型编码器差异而异。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often suffer from hallucination, partly due to
challenges in aligning multimodal information. We propose Prompt-in-Image, a
simple method that embeds textual instructions directly into images. This
removes the need for separate text inputs and forces the model to process all
content through the visual channel. We evaluate this method on three popular
open-source VLMs: Qwen2.5-VL, LLaVA-1.5, and InstructBLIP. The results reveal
sharp differences. Prompt-in-Image improves Qwen2.5-VL's performance,
increasing POPE accuracy by 4.1 percent (from 80.2 percent to 84.3 percent) and
also reducing hallucination rates on MS-COCO. In contrast, LLaVA-1.5 and
InstructBLIP experience a severe performance drop, with accuracy falling from
around 84 percent to near-random levels. Through detailed analysis, we found
that CLIP-based encoders in LLaVA and InstructBLIP exhibit excessive attention
bias toward embedded text regions, disrupting visual understanding. In
contrast, Qwen's vision encoder handles text-embedded images robustly.
Crucially, Prompt-in-Image reduces Qwen's modality gap, enhancing cross-modal
alignment by unifying information processing through a single modality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DisCo3D提出了一种新框架，通过将3D一致性先验知识蒸馏到2D编辑器中，解决了3D编辑中的多视角一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在2D图像生成和编辑中表现优异，但在3D编辑中保持多视角一致性仍具挑战性。现有方法存在收敛慢、模糊伪影和细粒度不一致等问题。

Method: DisCo3D通过多视图输入微调3D生成器进行场景适应，然后通过一致性蒸馏训练2D编辑器，最后通过高斯泼溅优化编辑后的多视图输出为3D表示。

Result: 实验表明，DisCo3D在多视角一致性上表现稳定，编辑质量优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DisCo3D为解决3D编辑中的多视角一致性问题提供了一种有效方法。

Abstract: While diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable progress in 2D image
generation and editing, extending these capabilities to 3D editing remains
challenging, particularly in maintaining multi-view consistency. Classical
approaches typically update 3D representations through iterative refinement
based on a single editing view. However, these methods often suffer from slow
convergence and blurry artifacts caused by cross-view inconsistencies. Recent
methods improve efficiency by propagating 2D editing attention features, yet
still exhibit fine-grained inconsistencies and failure modes in complex scenes
due to insufficient constraints. To address this, we propose \textbf{DisCo3D},
a novel framework that distills 3D consistency priors into a 2D editor. Our
method first fine-tunes a 3D generator using multi-view inputs for scene
adaptation, then trains a 2D editor through consistency distillation. The
edited multi-view outputs are finally optimized into 3D representations via
Gaussian Splatting. Experimental results show DisCo3D achieves stable
multi-view consistency and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in editing
quality.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PromptReg的无训练图像配准方法，通过直接搜索对应提示简化了传统区域匹配的两步流程，利用预训练分割模型实现高效配准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像配准需要先分割感兴趣区域再匹配，流程复杂且耗时。本文旨在简化这一过程，直接通过提示搜索实现区域匹配。

Method: 提出“对应提示问题”，并通过“反向提示”解决方案生成主提示和辅助提示，结合新的配准算法实现多区域匹配。

Result: 在多种医学和非医学图像数据集上，PromptReg在Dice和目标配准误差等指标上优于传统和基于学习的方法，甚至与需要全分割训练数据的弱监督方法竞争。

Conclusion: PromptReg通过提示搜索简化了图像配准流程，实现了高效且高精度的区域匹配，为图像配准提供了新思路。

Abstract: Establishing pixel/voxel-level or region-level correspondences is the core
challenge in image registration. The latter, also known as region-based
correspondence representation, leverages paired regions of interest (ROIs) to
enable regional matching while preserving fine-grained capability at
pixel/voxel level. Traditionally, this representation is implemented via two
steps: segmenting ROIs in each image then matching them between the two images.
In this paper, we simplify this into one step by directly "searching for
corresponding prompts", using extensively pre-trained segmentation models
(e.g., SAM) for a training-free registration approach, PromptReg. Firstly, we
introduce the "corresponding prompt problem", which aims to identify a
corresponding Prompt Y in Image Y for any given visual Prompt X in Image X,
such that the two respectively prompt-conditioned segmentations are a pair of
corresponding ROIs from the two images. Secondly, we present an "inverse
prompt" solution that generates primary and optionally auxiliary prompts,
inverting Prompt X into the prompt space of Image Y. Thirdly, we propose a
novel registration algorithm that identifies multiple paired corresponding ROIs
by marginalizing the inverted Prompt X across both prompt and spatial
dimensions. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on five applications of
registering 3D prostate MR, 3D abdomen MR, 3D lung CT, 2D histopathology and,
as a non-medical example, 2D aerial images. Based on metrics including Dice and
target registration errors on anatomical structures, the proposed registration
outperforms both intensity-based iterative algorithms and learning-based
DDF-predicting networks, even yielding competitive performance with
weakly-supervised approaches that require fully-segmented training data.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法在生成平滑且合理的过渡视频方面研究不足，尤其是基于首尾帧和文本提示的场景。

Method: VTG采用插值初始化、双方向运动微调和表示对齐正则化，提升预训练模型的运动平滑性和生成保真度。

Result: VTG在TransitBench基准测试中表现优异，覆盖概念混合和场景过渡任务。

Conclusion: VTG在多种过渡任务中均表现出色，为统一过渡生成研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Leveraging text, images, structure maps, or motion trajectories as
conditional guidance, diffusion models have achieved great success in automated
and high-quality video generation. However, generating smooth and rational
transition videos given the first and last video frames as well as descriptive
text prompts is far underexplored. We present VTG, a Versatile Transition video
Generation framework that can generate smooth, high-fidelity, and semantically
coherent video transitions. VTG introduces interpolation-based initialization
that helps preserve object identity and handle abrupt content changes
effectively. In addition, it incorporates dual-directional motion fine-tuning
and representation alignment regularization to mitigate the limitations of
pre-trained image-to-video diffusion models in motion smoothness and generation
fidelity, respectively. To evaluate VTG and facilitate future studies on
unified transition generation, we collected TransitBench, a comprehensive
benchmark for transition generation covering two representative transition
tasks: concept blending and scene transition. Extensive experiments show that
VTG achieves superior transition performance consistently across all four
tasks.

Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型对所有任务令牌采用静态处理路径，无法区分时间定位、显著性评估和文本生成等不同任务的需求。

Method: 提出TimeExpert，基于MoE架构，动态路由任务特定令牌到专门专家，实现高效计算和精准处理。

Result: 在密集视频描述、时刻检索和视频高光检测等任务中，TimeExpert表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TimeExpert通过任务分解和动态路由，显著提升了视频时间定位任务的性能。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to precisely identify video event
segments in response to textual queries. The outputs of VTG tasks manifest as
sequences of events, each defined by precise timestamps, saliency scores, and
textual descriptions. Despite recent advances, a fundamental limitation
persists in existing Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs): they process all
task tokens through identical and static pathways, failing to recognize that
temporal localization, saliency assessment, and textual generation represent
fundamentally distinct tasks requiring specialized processing. To address this,
we introduce TimeExpert, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based Video-LLM that
effectively decomposes VTG tasks by dynamically routing task-specific tokens
(e.g., timestamps, saliency scores) to specialized experts, with increased
computational efficiency. Our design choices enable precise handling of each
subtask, leading to improved event modeling across diverse VTG applications.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeExpert consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance on various VTG tasks such as Dense Video
Captioning, Moment Retrieval, and Video Highlight Detection.

Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅（3D-GS）在自动驾驶地图构建中具有潜力，但生成和更新高斯场景的时间和计算成本高，因此需要一种高效的更新方法。

Method: LT-Gaussian包含多模态高斯泼溅、结构变化检测模块和高斯地图更新模块，通过比较旧地图与当前LiDAR数据流识别变化并针对性更新。

Result: 实验表明，LT-Gaussian能高效更新地图，处理自动驾驶场景中的常见环境变化，且重建质量优于从头构建的策略。

Conclusion: LT-Gaussian通过利用新旧场景信息，实现了高效且高质量的地图更新，适用于自动驾驶系统。

Abstract: Maps play an important role in autonomous driving systems. The recently
proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) produces rendering-quality explicit
scene reconstruction results, demonstrating the potential for map construction
in autonomous driving scenarios. However, because of the time and computational
costs involved in generating Gaussian scenes, how to update the map becomes a
significant challenge. In this paper, we propose LT-Gaussian, a map update
method for 3D-GS-based maps. LT-Gaussian consists of three main components:
Multimodal Gaussian Splatting, Structural Change Detection Module, and
Gaussian-Map Update Module. Firstly, the Gaussian map of the old scene is
generated using our proposed Multimodal Gaussian Splatting. Subsequently,
during the map update process, we compare the outdated Gaussian map with the
current LiDAR data stream to identify structural changes. Finally, we perform
targeted updates to the Gaussian-map to generate an up-to-date map. We
establish a benchmark for map updating on the nuScenes dataset to
quantitatively evaluate our method. The experimental results show that
LT-Gaussian can effectively and efficiently update the Gaussian-map, handling
common environmental changes in autonomous driving scenarios. Furthermore, by
taking full advantage of information from both new and old scenes, LT-Gaussian
is able to produce higher quality reconstruction results compared to map update
strategies that reconstruct maps from scratch. Our open-source code is
available at https://github.com/ChengLuqi/LT-gaussian.

Motivation: 现有方法多依赖视觉线索，忽略了音频语义或采用粗粒度融合策略，导致多模态表示不理想。

Method: GAID包含帧级门控融合（FGF）和方向性自适应语义扰动（DASP），分别实现细粒度对齐和增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得SOTA结果，且效率显著提升。

Conclusion: GAID通过互补模块优化跨模态表示，实现了更稳定和高效的检索性能。

Abstract: Text-to-video retrieval requires precise alignment between language and
temporally rich video signals. Existing methods predominantly exploit visual
cues and often overlook complementary audio semantics or adopt coarse fusion
strategies, leading to suboptimal multimodal representations. We present GAID,
a framework that jointly address this gap via two key components: (i) a
Frame-level Gated Fusion (FGF) that adaptively integrates audio and visual
features under textual guidance, enabling fine-grained temporal alignment; and
(ii) a Directional Adaptive Semantic Perturbation (DASP) that injects
structure-aware perturbations into text embeddings, enhancing robustness and
discrimination without incurring multi-pass inference. These modules complement
each other -- fusion reduces modality gaps while perturbation regularizes
cross-modal matching -- yielding more stable and expressive representations.
Extensive experiments on MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, LSMDC, and VATEX show consistent
state-of-the-art results across all retrieval metrics with notable efficiency
gains. Our code is available at https://github.com/YangBowenn/GAID.

Abstract: Robot-assisted surgeries rely on accurate and real-time scene understanding
to safely guide surgical instruments. However, segmentation models trained on
static datasets face key limitations when deployed in these dynamic and
evolving surgical environments. Class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS)
allows models to continually adapt to new classes while avoiding catastrophic
forgetting of prior knowledge, without training on previous data. In this work,
we build upon the recently introduced Taxonomy-Oriented Poincar\'e-regularized
Incremental Class Segmentation (TOPICS) approach and propose an enhanced
variant, termed TOPICS+, specifically tailored for robust segmentation of
surgical scenes. Concretely, we incorporate the Dice loss into the hierarchical
loss formulation to handle strong class imbalances, introduce hierarchical
pseudo-labeling, and design tailored label taxonomies for robotic surgery
environments. We also propose six novel CISS benchmarks designed for robotic
surgery environments including multiple incremental steps and several semantic
categories to emulate realistic class-incremental settings in surgical
environments. In addition, we introduce a refined set of labels with more than
144 classes on the Syn-Mediverse synthetic dataset, hosted online as an
evaluation benchmark. We make the code and trained models publicly available at
http://topics.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GCC的电路发现方法，用于识别深度视觉模型中与特定视觉概念相关的神经元电路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度视觉模型的分布式表示使得定位特定视觉概念的编码位置具有挑战性，需要一种有效的方法来解析模型的内部结构。

Method: GCC方法通过迭代评估神经元间的功能依赖性和语义对齐，构建与查询相关的概念电路。

Result: GCC方法在多种深度图像分类模型中验证了其多功能性和有效性。

Conclusion: GCC为深度模型提供了细粒度的概念级解释，首次实现了与特定视觉概念相关的电路识别。

Abstract: Deep vision models have achieved remarkable classification performance by
leveraging a hierarchical architecture in which human-interpretable concepts
emerge through the composition of individual neurons across layers. Given the
distributed nature of representations, pinpointing where specific visual
concepts are encoded within a model remains a crucial yet challenging task. In
this paper, we introduce an effective circuit discovery method, called Granular
Concept Circuit (GCC), in which each circuit represents a concept relevant to a
given query. To construct each circuit, our method iteratively assesses
inter-neuron connectivity, focusing on both functional dependencies and
semantic alignment. By automatically discovering multiple circuits, each
capturing specific concepts within that query, our approach offers a profound,
concept-wise interpretation of models and is the first to identify circuits
tied to specific visual concepts at a fine-grained level. We validate the
versatility and effectiveness of GCCs across various deep image classification
models.

TL;DR: AMOT是一种多目标跟踪方法，通过结合外观和运动线索，解决了无人机视频中视角变化和复杂运动带来的跟踪挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机视频中的视角变化和复杂运动导致跟踪不稳定，现有方法未能充分利用外观和运动的时空交互。

Method: 提出AMOT，包含外观-运动一致性矩阵（AMC）和运动感知轨迹延续模块（MTC），联合利用外观和运动线索。

Result: 在VisDrone2019、UAVDT和VT-MOT-UAV三个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，且无需训练即可泛化。

Conclusion: AMOT通过外观和运动的联合建模，显著提升了无人机视频中的多目标跟踪性能。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) aims to track multiple objects while maintaining
consistent identities across frames of a given video. In unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) recorded videos, frequent viewpoint changes and complex
UAV-ground relative motion dynamics pose significant challenges, which often
lead to unstable affinity measurement and ambiguous association. Existing
methods typically model motion and appearance cues separately, overlooking
their spatio-temporal interplay and resulting in suboptimal tracking
performance. In this work, we propose AMOT, which jointly exploits appearance
and motion cues through two key components: an Appearance-Motion Consistency
(AMC) matrix and a Motion-aware Track Continuation (MTC) module. Specifically,
the AMC matrix computes bi-directional spatial consistency under the guidance
of appearance features, enabling more reliable and context-aware identity
association. The MTC module complements AMC by reactivating unmatched tracks
through appearance-guided predictions that align with Kalman-based predictions,
thereby reducing broken trajectories caused by missed detections. Extensive
experiments on three UAV benchmarks, including VisDrone2019, UAVDT, and
VT-MOT-UAV, demonstrate that our AMOT outperforms current state-of-the-art
methods and generalizes well in a plug-and-play and training-free manner.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpectralX是一种参数高效微调框架，通过两阶段训练方法，将现有遥感基础模型（RSFMs）适应于多光谱/高光谱数据，显著提升领域泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RSFMs主要针对光学图像预训练，缺乏多光谱/高光谱数据的对应模型，因此探索如何高效适应现有模型处理不同光谱模态。

Method: 提出两阶段训练方法：第一阶段通过掩码重建任务和Hyper Tokenizer提取空间和光谱维度属性令牌；第二阶段引入Attribute-refined Adapter，通过高低级特征迭代查询优化任务相关属性。

Result: SpectralX能够有效适应新区域或季节的光谱图像，显著提升领域泛化性能。

Conclusion: SpectralX为多光谱/高光谱数据的处理提供了一种高效且参数优化的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs) have led to
significant breakthroughs in the field. While many RSFMs have been pretrained
with massive optical imagery, more multispectral/hyperspectral data remain lack
of the corresponding foundation models. To leverage the advantages of spectral
imagery in earth observation, we explore whether existing RSFMs can be
effectively adapted to process diverse spectral modalities without requiring
extensive spectral pretraining. In response to this challenge, we proposed
SpectralX, an innovative parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework that adapt
existing RSFMs as backbone while introducing a two-stage training approach to
handle various spectral inputs, thereby significantly improving domain
generalization performance. In the first stage, we employ a
masked-reconstruction task and design a specialized Hyper Tokenizer (HyperT) to
extract attribute tokens from both spatial and spectral dimensions.
Simultaneously, we develop an Attribute-oriented Mixture of Adapter (AoMoA)
that dynamically aggregates multi-attribute expert knowledge while performing
layer-wise fine-tuning. With semantic segmentation as downstream task in the
second stage, we insert an Attribute-refined Adapter (Are-adapter) into the
first stage framework. By iteratively querying low-level semantic features with
high-level representations, the model learns to focus on task-beneficial
attributes, enabling customized adjustment of RSFMs. Following this two-phase
adaptation process, SpectralX is capable of interpreting spectral imagery from
new regions or seasons. The codes will be available from the website:

TL;DR: AG$^2$aussian提出了一种基于锚图结构的框架，用于组织语义特征和规范高斯基元，实现了干净且准确的实例级高斯选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过将语义特征附加到自由高斯集合并通过可微分渲染提取特征，导致分割噪声和高斯选择混乱。

Method: 利用锚图结构组织语义特征，促进紧凑且实例感知的高斯分布，并支持基于图的传播。

Result: 在四种应用（交互式点击查询、开放词汇文本驱动查询、物体移除编辑和物理模拟）中验证了方法的优势。

Conclusion: 实验和消融研究证明了关键设计的有效性，展示了AG$^2$aussian在多种应用中的潜力。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has witnessed exponential adoption across
diverse applications, driving a critical need for semantic-aware 3D Gaussian
representations to enable scene understanding and editing tasks. Existing
approaches typically attach semantic features to a collection of free Gaussians
and distill the features via differentiable rendering, leading to noisy
segmentation and a messy selection of Gaussians. In this paper, we introduce
AG$^2$aussian, a novel framework that leverages an anchor-graph structure to
organize semantic features and regulate Gaussian primitives. Our anchor-graph
structure not only promotes compact and instance-aware Gaussian distributions,
but also facilitates graph-based propagation, achieving a clean and accurate
instance-level Gaussian selection. Extensive validation across four
applications, i.e. interactive click-based query, open-vocabulary text-driven
query, object removal editing, and physics simulation, demonstrates the
advantages of our approach and its benefits to various applications. The
experiments and ablation studies further evaluate the effectiveness of the key
designs of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SEA的新型灰盒越狱攻击方法，针对微调后的视觉语言模型（VLMs），展示了基模型漏洞可能被继承的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示微调后的VLMs可能保留基模型的漏洞，从而面临可转移的越狱攻击风险。

Method: SEA结合了Fine-tuning Trajectory Simulation（FTS）和Targeted Prompt Guidance（TPG）技术，分别模拟视觉编码器参数变化和引导语言解码器输出。

Result: 在Qwen2-VL家族（2B和7B）上，SEA实现了超过86.5%的转移攻击成功率和49.5%的毒性率。

Conclusion: 研究强调了保护微调后的VLMs免受基模型漏洞影响的紧迫性，呼吁开发全生命周期防御措施。

Abstract: Fine-tuning open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs) creates a critical yet
underexplored attack surface: vulnerabilities in the base VLM could be retained
in fine-tuned variants, rendering them susceptible to transferable jailbreak
attacks. To demonstrate this risk, we introduce the Simulated Ensemble Attack
(SEA), a novel grey-box jailbreak method in which the adversary has full access
to the base VLM but no knowledge of the fine-tuned target's weights or training
configuration. To improve jailbreak transferability across fine-tuned VLMs, SEA
combines two key techniques: Fine-tuning Trajectory Simulation (FTS) and
Targeted Prompt Guidance (TPG). FTS generates transferable adversarial images
by simulating the vision encoder's parameter shifts, while TPG is a textual
strategy that steers the language decoder toward adversarially optimized
outputs. Experiments on the Qwen2-VL family (2B and 7B) demonstrate that SEA
achieves high transfer attack success rates exceeding 86.5% and toxicity rates
near 49.5% across diverse fine-tuned variants, even those specifically
fine-tuned to improve safety behaviors. Notably, while direct PGD-based image
jailbreaks rarely transfer across fine-tuned VLMs, SEA reliably exploits
inherited vulnerabilities from the base model, significantly enhancing
transferability. These findings highlight an urgent need to safeguard
fine-tuned proprietary VLMs against transferable vulnerabilities inherited from
open-source foundations, motivating the development of holistic defenses across
the entire model lifecycle.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期动作预测在人机交互和辅助技术中至关重要，但现有方法存在视觉线索利用不足、语义依赖忽略和缺乏显式认知推理的问题。

Method: INSIGHT分为两阶段：1）提取手-物交互特征并利用动词-名词共现矩阵增强动作表示；2）通过强化学习模块模拟认知推理（感知-推理-预测）。

Result: 在Ego4D、EPIC-Kitchens-55和EGTEA Gaze+基准测试中，INSIGHT达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: INSIGHT通过结合语义特征和认知推理，显著提升了长期动作预测的泛化能力和准确性。

Abstract: Long-term action anticipation from egocentric video is critical for
applications such as human-computer interaction and assistive technologies,
where anticipating user intent enables proactive and context-aware AI
assistance. However, existing approaches suffer from three key limitations: 1)
underutilization of fine-grained visual cues from hand-object interactions, 2)
neglect of semantic dependencies between verbs and nouns, and 3) lack of
explicit cognitive reasoning, limiting generalization and long-term forecasting
ability. To overcome these challenges, we propose INSIGHT, a unified two-stage
framework for egocentric action anticipation. In the first stage, INSIGHT
focuses on extracting semantically rich features from hand-object interaction
regions and enhances action representations using a verb-noun co-occurrence
matrix. In the second stage, it introduces a reinforcement learning-based
module that simulates explicit cognitive reasoning through a structured
process: visual perception (think) -> intention inference (reason) -> action
anticipation (answer). Extensive experiments on Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens-55, and
EGTEA Gaze+ benchmarks show that INSIGHT achieves state-of-the-art performance,
demonstrating its effectiveness and strong generalization capability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新框架，通过解耦采样与优化过程，并利用信息子空间匹配减少噪声影响，显著提升了隐私保护数据集蒸馏的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器学习依赖大量敏感数据，隐私保护成为关键问题。差分隐私数据生成虽能保护隐私，但需要大量数据且性能受限。数据集蒸馏（DD）因其高效性成为解决方案，但现有方法存在采样-优化同步和噪声信号依赖问题。

Method: 提出新框架，解耦采样与优化过程，通过信息子空间匹配减少差分隐私噪声的影响。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上，每类50张图像时性能提升10.0%，蒸馏集大小仅为先前方法的五分之一时仍提升8.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了隐私保护数据集蒸馏的效率与性能，具有重要应用潜力。

Abstract: Modern machine learning models heavily rely on large datasets that often
include sensitive and private information, raising serious privacy concerns.
Differentially private (DP) data generation offers a solution by creating
synthetic datasets that limit the leakage of private information within a
predefined privacy budget; however, it requires a substantial amount of data to
achieve performance comparable to models trained on the original data. To
mitigate the significant expense incurred with synthetic data generation,
Dataset Distillation (DD) stands out for its remarkable training and storage
efficiency. This efficiency is particularly advantageous when integrated with
DP mechanisms, curating compact yet informative synthetic datasets without
compromising privacy. However, current state-of-the-art private DD methods
suffer from a synchronized sampling-optimization process and the dependency on
noisy training signals from randomly initialized networks. This results in the
inefficient utilization of private information due to the addition of excessive
noise. To address these issues, we introduce a novel framework that decouples
sampling from optimization for better convergence and improves signal quality
by mitigating the impact of DP noise through matching in an informative
subspace. On CIFAR-10, our method achieves a \textbf{10.0\%} improvement with
50 images per class and \textbf{8.3\%} increase with just \textbf{one-fifth}
the distilled set size of previous state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating
significant potential to advance privacy-preserving DD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奶牛活动和行为与健康及福利相关，但人工监测费时且不一致，需自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用多摄像头系统，结合YOLO11-m模型和SAMURAI进行实例分割与跟踪，采用运动感知卡尔曼滤波和数据关联。

Result: 系统表现优异，MOTA达98.7%和99.3%，IDF1分数超99%，身份切换接近零。

Conclusion: 该系统能实时跟踪复杂环境中的奶牛，减少冗余检测，有望通过行为分类改善疾病早期预测。

Abstract: Activity and behaviour correlate with dairy cow health and welfare, making
continual and accurate monitoring crucial for disease identification and farm
productivity. Manual observation and frequent assessments are laborious and
inconsistent for activity monitoring. In this study, we developed a unique
multi-camera, real-time tracking system for indoor-housed Holstein Friesian
dairy cows. This technology uses cutting-edge computer vision techniques,
including instance segmentation and tracking algorithms to monitor cow activity
seamlessly and accurately. An integrated top-down barn panorama was created by
geometrically aligning six camera feeds using homographic transformations. The
detection phase used a refined YOLO11-m model trained on an overhead cow
dataset, obtaining high accuracy (mAP\@0.50 = 0.97, F1 = 0.95). SAMURAI, an
upgraded Segment Anything Model 2.1, generated pixel-precise cow masks for
instance segmentation utilizing zero-shot learning and motion-aware memory.
Even with occlusion and fluctuating posture, a motion-aware Linear Kalman
filter and IoU-based data association reliably identified cows over time for
object tracking. The proposed system significantly outperformed Deep SORT
Realtime. Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) was 98.7% and 99.3% in two
benchmark video sequences, with IDF1 scores above 99% and near-zero identity
switches. This unified multi-camera system can track dairy cows in complex
interior surroundings in real time, according to our data. The system reduces
redundant detections across overlapping cameras, maintains continuity as cows
move between viewpoints, with the aim of improving early sickness prediction
through activity quantification and behavioural classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言在指导导航代理时存在模糊性和冗长性，影响了复杂环境中的导航效果。

Method: 提出视觉提示导航（VPN）范式，使用2D俯视图标记导航轨迹，构建了R2R-VP和R2R-CE-VP数据集，并设计了VPNet网络及数据增强策略。

Result: 实验评估了视觉提示形式、俯视图格式和数据增强策略对导航性能的影响。

Conclusion: VPN提供了一种直观且空间明确的导航指导方式，适合非专业用户，并减少了语言解释的模糊性。

Abstract: While natural language is commonly used to guide embodied agents, the
inherent ambiguity and verbosity of language often hinder the effectiveness of
language-guided navigation in complex environments. To this end, we propose
Visual Prompt Navigation (VPN), a novel paradigm that guides agents to navigate
using only user-provided visual prompts within 2D top-view maps. This visual
prompt primarily focuses on marking the visual navigation trajectory on a
top-down view of a scene, offering intuitive and spatially grounded guidance
without relying on language instructions. It is more friendly for non-expert
users and reduces interpretive ambiguity. We build VPN tasks in both discrete
and continuous navigation settings, constructing two new datasets, R2R-VP and
R2R-CE-VP, by extending existing R2R and R2R-CE episodes with corresponding
visual prompts. Furthermore, we introduce VPNet, a dedicated baseline network
to handle the VPN tasks, with two data augmentation strategies: view-level
augmentation (altering initial headings and prompt orientations) and
trajectory-level augmentation (incorporating diverse trajectories from
large-scale 3D scenes), to enhance navigation performance. Extensive
experiments evaluate how visual prompt forms, top-view map formats, and data
augmentation strategies affect the performance of visual prompt navigation. The
code is available at https://github.com/farlit/VPN.

Conclusion: DiffSemanticFusion通过融合多模态表示，显著提升了自动驾驶任务的性能，地图扩散模块可扩展至其他方法。

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires accurate scene understanding, including road
geometry, traffic agents, and their semantic relationships. In online HD map
generation scenarios, raster-based representations are well-suited to vision
models but lack geometric precision, while graph-based representations retain
structural detail but become unstable without precise maps. To harness the
complementary strengths of both, we propose DiffSemanticFusion -- a fusion
framework for multimodal trajectory prediction and planning. Our approach
reasons over a semantic raster-fused BEV space, enhanced by a map diffusion
module that improves both the stability and expressiveness of online HD map
representations. We validate our framework on two downstream tasks: trajectory
prediction and planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving. Experiments on
real-world autonomous driving benchmarks, nuScenes and NAVSIM, demonstrate
improved performance over several state-of-the-art methods. For the prediction
task on nuScenes, we integrate DiffSemanticFusion with the online HD map
informed QCNet, achieving a 5.1\% performance improvement. For end-to-end
autonomous driving in NAVSIM, DiffSemanticFusion achieves state-of-the-art
results, with a 15\% performance gain in NavHard scenarios. In addition,
extensive ablation and sensitivity studies show that our map diffusion module
can be seamlessly integrated into other vector-based approaches to enhance
performance. All artifacts are available at

Motivation: 传统方法依赖肝脏血管结构先验知识，耗时且复杂，希望提出一种无需显式先验知识的方法。

Method: 使用3D点表示CT图像，并添加图推理模块学习点邻域间的亲和力，隐式学习肝脏血管结构。

Result: 在MSD和LiTS数据集上，Dice系数和平均表面距离得分优于四种点基方法。

Conclusion: 该方法无需显式先验知识，通过图推理模块有效学习肝脏血管结构，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: The preoperative planning of liver surgery relies on Couinaud segmentation
from computed tomography (CT) images, to reduce the risk of bleeding and guide
the resection procedure. Using 3D point-based representations, rather than
voxelizing the CT volume, has the benefit of preserving the physical resolution
of the CT. However, point-based representations need prior knowledge of the
liver vessel structure, which is time consuming to acquire. Here, we propose a
point-based method for Couinaud segmentation, without explicitly providing the
prior liver vessel structure. To allow the model to learn this anatomical liver
vessel structure, we add a graph reasoning module on top of the point features.
This adds implicit anatomical information to the model, by learning affinities
across point neighborhoods. Our method is competitive on the MSD and LiTS
public datasets in Dice coefficient and average surface distance scores
compared to four pioneering point-based methods. Our code is available at

Abstract: While 3D hand reconstruction from monocular images has made significant
progress, generating accurate and temporally coherent motion estimates from
videos remains challenging, particularly during hand-object interactions. In
this paper, we present a novel 3D hand motion recovery framework that enhances
image-based reconstructions through a diffusion-based and physics-augmented
motion refinement model. Our model captures the distribution of refined motion
estimates conditioned on initial ones, generating improved sequences through an
iterative denoising process. Instead of relying on scarce annotated video data,
we train our model only using motion capture data without images. We identify
valuable intuitive physics knowledge during hand-object interactions, including
key motion states and their associated motion constraints. We effectively
integrate these physical insights into our diffusion model to improve its
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves various frame-wise reconstruction methods, achieving state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance on existing benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决从平面目标中估计相机姿态的问题，尤其是在存在测量噪声的情况下提高鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper presents a simple algebraic method to estimate the pose of a
camera relative to a planar target from $n \geq 4$ reference points with known
coordinates in the target frame and their corresponding bearing measurements in
the camera frame. The proposed approach follows a hierarchical structure;
first, the unit vector normal to the target plane is determined, followed by
the camera's position vector, its distance to the target plane, and finally,
the full orientation. To improve the method's robustness to measurement noise,
an averaging methodology is introduced to refine the estimation of the target's
normal direction. The accuracy and robustness of the approach are validated

TL;DR: OmniEvent是一个统一的事件表示学习框架，通过解耦-增强-融合范式解决事件数据的时空不均匀性问题，无需任务特定设计即可在多任务中实现SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机因其高动态范围和时间分辨率在计算机视觉中日益流行，但事件网络因数据分布和时空不均匀性依赖任务特定设计，难以复用现有架构。

Method: 提出解耦-增强-融合范式，独立处理时空域特征以避免不均匀性，利用空间填充曲线扩展感受野并提升效率，通过注意力融合时空特征。

Result: OmniEvent在3个代表性任务和10个数据集中性能超越任务特定SOTA方法高达68.2%，输出网格张量支持标准视觉模型处理事件数据。

Conclusion: OmniEvent通过统一框架解决了事件数据的时空不均匀性问题，实现了多任务的高性能，无需任务特定设计。

Abstract: Event cameras have gained increasing popularity in computer vision due to
their ultra-high dynamic range and temporal resolution. However, event networks
heavily rely on task-specific designs due to the unstructured data distribution
and spatial-temporal (S-T) inhomogeneity, making it hard to reuse existing
architectures for new tasks. We propose OmniEvent, the first unified event
representation learning framework that achieves SOTA performance across diverse
tasks, fully removing the need of task-specific designs. Unlike previous
methods that treat event data as 3D point clouds with manually tuned S-T
scaling weights, OmniEvent proposes a decouple-enhance-fuse paradigm, where the
local feature aggregation and enhancement is done independently on the spatial
and temporal domains to avoid inhomogeneity issues. Space-filling curves are
applied to enable large receptive fields while improving memory and compute
efficiency. The features from individual domains are then fused by attention to
learn S-T interactions. The output of OmniEvent is a grid-shaped tensor, which
enables standard vision models to process event data without architecture
change. With a unified framework and similar hyper-parameters, OmniEvent
out-performs (tasks-specific) SOTA by up to 68.2% across 3 representative tasks
and 10 datasets (Fig.1). Code will be ready in

Abstract: Adversarial attacks against computer vision systems have emerged as a
critical research area that challenges the fundamental assumptions about neural
network robustness and security. This comprehensive survey examines the
evolving landscape of adversarial techniques, revealing their dual nature as
both sophisticated security threats and valuable defensive tools. We provide a
systematic analysis of adversarial attack methodologies across three primary
domains: pixel-space attacks, physically realizable attacks, and latent-space
attacks. Our investigation traces the technical evolution from early
gradient-based methods such as FGSM and PGD to sophisticated optimization
techniques incorporating momentum, adaptive step sizes, and advanced
transferability mechanisms. We examine how physically realizable attacks have
successfully bridged the gap between digital vulnerabilities and real-world
threats through adversarial patches, 3D textures, and dynamic optical
perturbations. Additionally, we explore the emergence of latent-space attacks
that leverage semantic structure in internal representations to create more
transferable and meaningful adversarial examples. Beyond traditional offensive
applications, we investigate the constructive use of adversarial techniques for
vulnerability assessment in biometric authentication systems and protection
against malicious generative models. Our analysis reveals critical research
gaps, particularly in neural style transfer protection and computational
efficiency requirements. This survey contributes a comprehensive taxonomy,
evolution analysis, and identification of future research directions, aiming to
advance understanding of adversarial vulnerabilities and inform the development
of more robust and trustworthy computer vision systems.

### [136] [Context Guided Transformer Entropy Modeling for Video Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01852)
*Junlong Tong,Wei Zhang,Yaohui Jin,Xiaoyu Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于上下文引导变换器（CGT）的熵模型，通过重新采样时间上下文和依赖加权的空间上下文，减少视频冗余，同时降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的条件熵模型在利用时空上下文时，常因时间上下文引入额外复杂性和计算成本，且空间上下文模型缺乏对依赖顺序的显式建模，限制了解码时的上下文可用性。

Method: 提出CGT熵模型，包括时间上下文重采样器和依赖加权的空间上下文分配器（教师-学生网络），显式建模空间依赖顺序并减少计算开销。

Result: 实验表明，CGT模型将熵建模时间减少约65%，BD-Rate降低11%。

Conclusion: CGT模型有效解决了现有熵模型的问题，显著提升了性能和效率。

Abstract: Conditional entropy models effectively leverage spatio-temporal contexts to
reduce video redundancy. However, incorporating temporal context often
introduces additional model complexity and increases computational cost. In
parallel, many existing spatial context models lack explicit modeling the
ordering of spatial dependencies, which may limit the availability of relevant
context during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Context Guided
Transformer (CGT) entropy model, which estimates probability mass functions of
the current frame conditioned on resampled temporal context and
dependency-weighted spatial context. A temporal context resampler learns
predefined latent queries to extract critical temporal information using
transformer encoders, reducing downstream computational overhead. Meanwhile, a
teacher-student network is designed as dependency-weighted spatial context
assigner to explicitly model the dependency of spatial context order. The
teacher generates an attention map to represent token importance and an entropy
map to reflect prediction certainty from randomly masked inputs, guiding the
student to select the weighted top-k tokens with the highest spatial
dependency. During inference, only the student is used to predict undecoded
tokens based on high-dependency context. Experimental results demonstrate that
our CGT model reduces entropy modeling time by approximately 65% and achieves
an 11% BD-Rate reduction compared to the previous state-of-the-art conditional
entropy model.

TL;DR: 研究通过结合眼动和脑电图数据，在自由视觉搜索中区分目标与非目标注视点，显著提升了现实场景中的分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究基于明确指令和抽象刺激，忽略了场景上下文，而人类视觉搜索受场景特征驱动，因此需研究更现实的场景。

Method: 采用36名参与者的用户研究，使用140种现实场景（如桌面图标和工具搜索），结合眼动和脑电图特征进行分类。

Result: 新方法在跨用户评估中达到83.6%准确率，显著优于基于扫视相关电位的传统方法（56.9%）。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了现实场景中目标与非目标注视点的区分能力，为辅助系统提供了更可靠的依据。

Abstract: Distinguishing target from non-target fixations during visual search is a
fundamental building block to understand users' intended actions and to build
effective assistance systems. While prior research indicated the feasibility of
classifying target vs. non-target fixations based on eye tracking and
electroencephalography (EEG) data, these studies were conducted with explicitly
instructed search trajectories, abstract visual stimuli, and disregarded any
scene context. This is in stark contrast with the fact that human visual search
is largely driven by scene characteristics and raises questions regarding
generalizability to more realistic scenarios. To close this gap, we, for the
first time, investigate the classification of target vs. non-target fixations
during free visual search in realistic scenes. In particular, we conducted a
36-participants user study using a large variety of 140 realistic visual search
scenes in two highly relevant application scenarios: searching for icons on
desktop backgrounds and finding tools in a cluttered workshop. Our approach
based on gaze and EEG features outperforms the previous state-of-the-art
approach based on a combination of fixation duration and saccade-related
potentials. We perform extensive evaluations to assess the generalizability of
our approach across scene types. Our approach significantly advances the
ability to distinguish between target and non-target fixations in realistic
scenarios, achieving 83.6% accuracy in cross-user evaluations. This
substantially outperforms previous methods based on saccade-related potentials,
which reached only 56.9% accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度伪造技术的快速发展，需要更鲁棒和准确的检测算法，同时精确定位伪造伪影对提升模型解释性和用户信任至关重要。

Method: 利用去噪扩散模型生成高质量的结构差异（DSSIM）图，捕捉细微伪造痕迹，并与预训练检测器提取的高层语义特征融合。

Result: 在跨数据集和数据集内基准测试中，DiffusionFF表现出卓越的检测性能和精细的伪影定位能力。

Conclusion: DiffusionFF在检测准确性和伪影定位方面均表现出色，证明了其整体有效性。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of deepfake generation techniques demands robust and
accurate face forgery detection algorithms. While determining whether an image
has been manipulated remains essential, the ability to precisely localize
forgery artifacts has become increasingly important for improving model
explainability and fostering user trust. To address this challenge, we propose
DiffusionFF, a novel framework that enhances face forgery detection through
diffusion-based artifact localization. Our method utilizes a denoising
diffusion model to generate high-quality Structural Dissimilarity (DSSIM) maps,
which effectively capture subtle traces of manipulation. These DSSIM maps are
then fused with high-level semantic features extracted by a pretrained forgery
detector, leading to significant improvements in detection accuracy. Extensive
experiments on both cross-dataset and intra-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that
DiffusionFF not only achieves superior detection performance but also offers
precise and fine-grained artifact localization, highlighting its overall
effectiveness.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在实时视频流处理中缺乏任务驱动规划和未来预测的问题，提升响应速度和决策主动性。

Method: 结合问题语义和历史观察，预测关键事件的时间进展，调整感知动作，并设计流式KV-cache内存机制以高效检索语义。

Result: 在实时视频理解任务中，方法在响应准确性和效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: StreamAgent在实时视频流处理中具有实际应用价值，提升了主动性和效率。

Abstract: Real-time streaming video understanding in domains such as autonomous driving
and intelligent surveillance poses challenges beyond conventional offline video
processing, requiring continuous perception, proactive decision making, and
responsive interaction based on dynamically evolving visual content. However,
existing methods rely on alternating perception-reaction or asynchronous
triggers, lacking task-driven planning and future anticipation, which limits
their real-time responsiveness and proactive decision making in evolving video
streams. To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal
intervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant
information to enable proactive and goal-driven responses. Specifically, we
integrate question semantics and historical observations through prompting the
anticipatory agent to anticipate the temporal progression of key events, align
current observations with the expected future evidence, and subsequently adjust
the perception action (e.g., attending to task-relevant regions or continuously
tracking in subsequent frames). To enable efficient inference, we design a
streaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory
structure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic
retrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional
KV-cache. Extensive experiments on streaming and long video understanding tasks
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in response accuracy
and real-time efficiency, highlighting its practical value for real-world
streaming scenarios.

Motivation: 医学影像研究依赖大规模数据共享，但患者隐私保护是主要挑战。现有去标识化工具缺乏客观评估方法，限制了可重复性和监管信心。

Method: 开发了包含合成PHI/PII的DICOM数据集（MIDI），并提供了评估工具（Python脚本、答案键等），用于自动化比较去标识化效果。

Result: MIDI数据集包含538名受试者、53,581个DICOM图像实例，支持多厂商、多模态和多种癌症类型的评估。

Conclusion: 该框架支持标准化、客观的去标识化评估，促进更安全、一致的医学图像共享。

Abstract: Medical imaging research increasingly depends on large-scale data sharing to
promote reproducibility and train Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. Ensuring
patient privacy remains a significant challenge for open-access data sharing.
Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM), the global standard
data format for medical imaging, encodes both essential clinical metadata and
extensive protected health information (PHI) and personally identifiable
information (PII). Effective de-identification must remove identifiers,
preserve scientific utility, and maintain DICOM validity. Tools exist to
perform de-identification, but few assess its effectiveness, and most rely on
subjective reviews, limiting reproducibility and regulatory confidence. To
address this gap, we developed an openly accessible DICOM dataset infused with
synthetic PHI/PII and an evaluation framework for benchmarking image
de-identification workflows. The Medical Image de-identification (MIDI) dataset
was built using publicly available de-identified data from The Cancer Imaging
Archive (TCIA). It includes 538 subjects (216 for validation, 322 for testing),
605 studies, 708 series, and 53,581 DICOM image instances. These span multiple
vendors, imaging modalities, and cancer types. Synthetic PHI and PII were
embedded into structured data elements, plain text data elements, and pixel
data to simulate real-world identity leaks encountered by TCIA curation teams.
Accompanying evaluation tools include a Python script, answer keys (known
truth), and mapping files that enable automated comparison of curated data
against expected transformations. The framework is aligned with the HIPAA
Privacy Rule "Safe Harbor" method, DICOM PS3.15 Confidentiality Profiles, and
TCIA best practices. It supports objective, standards-driven evaluation of
de-identification workflows, promoting safer and more consistent medical image
sharing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能眼镜全天候使用需解决多模态AI代理的能耗问题，以实现高效传感和记忆增强。

Method: 采用轻量级音频模型（YAMNet）和自定义分类头，通过手-物交互音频提示触发图像捕捉。

Result: EgoTrigger平均减少54%的帧数，显著节省能耗，同时在记忆任务中表现相当。

Conclusion: 上下文感知触发策略为全天候智能眼镜提供了高效节能的解决方案。

Abstract: All-day smart glasses are likely to emerge as platforms capable of continuous
contextual sensing, uniquely positioning them for unprecedented assistance in
our daily lives. Integrating the multi-modal AI agents required for human
memory enhancement while performing continuous sensing, however, presents a
major energy efficiency challenge for all-day usage. Achieving this balance
requires intelligent, context-aware sensor management. Our approach,
EgoTrigger, leverages audio cues from the microphone to selectively activate
power-intensive cameras, enabling efficient sensing while preserving
substantial utility for human memory enhancement. EgoTrigger uses a lightweight
audio model (YAMNet) and a custom classification head to trigger image capture
from hand-object interaction (HOI) audio cues, such as the sound of a drawer
opening or a medication bottle being opened. In addition to evaluating on the
QA-Ego4D dataset, we introduce and evaluate on the Human Memory Enhancement
Question-Answer (HME-QA) dataset. Our dataset contains 340 human-annotated
first-person QA pairs from full-length Ego4D videos that were curated to ensure
that they contained audio, focusing on HOI moments critical for contextual
understanding and memory. Our results show EgoTrigger can use 54% fewer frames
on average, significantly saving energy in both power-hungry sensing components
(e.g., cameras) and downstream operations (e.g., wireless transmission), while
achieving comparable performance on datasets for an episodic memory task. We
believe this context-aware triggering strategy represents a promising direction
for enabling energy-efficient, functional smart glasses capable of all-day use
-- supporting applications like helping users recall where they placed their
keys or information about their routine activities (e.g., taking medications).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究统一视觉语言模型（VLM）在工业检测中的可行性，以简化多任务视觉流程。

Method: 使用InspectVLM（基于Florence-2）和InspectMM数据集进行评估。

Result: InspectVLM在分类和关键点任务上表现尚可，但在核心检测指标上不如ResNet，且对提示敏感、输出不稳定。

Conclusion: 当前VLM在视觉基础和鲁棒性上不足，不适合高精度工业检测。

Abstract: Unified vision-language models (VLMs) promise to streamline computer vision
pipelines by reframing multiple visual tasks such as classification, detection,
and keypoint localization within a single language-driven interface. This
architecture is particularly appealing in industrial inspection, where managing
disjoint task-specific models introduces complexity, inefficiency, and
maintenance overhead. In this paper, we critically evaluate the viability of
this unified paradigm using InspectVLM, a Florence-2-based VLM trained on
InspectMM, our new large-scale multimodal, multitask inspection dataset. While
InspectVLM performs competitively on image-level classification and structured
keypoint tasks, we find that it fails to match traditional ResNet-based models
in core inspection metrics. Notably, the model exhibits brittle behavior under
low prompt variability, produces degenerate outputs for fine-grained object
detection, and frequently defaults to memorized language responses regardless
of visual input. Our findings suggest that while language-driven unification
offers conceptual elegance, current VLMs lack the visual grounding and
robustness necessary for deployment in precision critical industrial
inspections.

Abstract: Instance segmentation is critical in biomedical imaging to accurately
distinguish individual objects like cells, which often overlap and vary in
size. Recent query-based methods, where object queries guide segmentation, have
shown strong performance. While U-Net has been a go-to architecture in medical
image segmentation, its potential in query-based approaches remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we present IAUNet, a novel query-based U-Net
architecture. The core design features a full U-Net architecture, enhanced by a
novel lightweight convolutional Pixel decoder, making the model more efficient
and reducing the number of parameters. Additionally, we propose a Transformer
decoder that refines object-specific features across multiple scales. Finally,
we introduce the 2025 Revvity Full Cell Segmentation Dataset, a unique resource
with detailed annotations of overlapping cell cytoplasm in brightfield images,
setting a new benchmark for biomedical instance segmentation. Experiments on
multiple public datasets and our own show that IAUNet outperforms most
state-of-the-art fully convolutional, transformer-based, and query-based models
and cell segmentation-specific models, setting a strong baseline for cell
instance segmentation tasks. Code is available at

Result: 在CIFAR-10和GTSRB上，DBOM能有效检测中毒图像，提升训练管道的安全性。

Conclusion: DBOM为后门攻击提供了一种主动防御方法，能够应对未见过的触发器-对象配置。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) and generative AI (GenAI) are increasingly
vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries embed triggers into inputs to
cause models to misclassify or misinterpret target labels. Beyond traditional
single-trigger scenarios, attackers may inject multiple triggers across various
object classes, forming unseen backdoor-object configurations that evade
standard detection pipelines. In this paper, we introduce DBOM (Disentangled
Backdoor-Object Modeling), a proactive framework that leverages structured
disentanglement to identify and neutralize both seen and unseen backdoor
threats at the dataset level. Specifically, DBOM factorizes input image
representations by modeling triggers and objects as independent primitives in
the embedding space through the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By
leveraging the frozen, pre-trained encoders of VLMs, our approach decomposes
the latent representations into distinct components through a learnable visual
prompt repository and prompt prefix tuning, ensuring that the relationships
between triggers and objects are explicitly captured. To separate trigger and
object representations in the visual prompt repository, we introduce the
trigger-object separation and diversity losses that aids in disentangling
trigger and object visual features. Next, by aligning image features with
feature decomposition and fusion, as well as learned contextual prompt tokens
in a shared multimodal space, DBOM enables zero-shot generalization to novel
trigger-object pairings that were unseen during training, thereby offering
deeper insights into adversarial attack patterns. Experimental results on
CIFAR-10 and GTSRB demonstrate that DBOM robustly detects poisoned images prior
to downstream training, significantly enhancing the security of DNN training
pipelines.

To benchmark our method and foster further research, we introduce two newly

Abstract: One-stage object detectors such as the YOLO family achieve state-of-the-art
performance in real-time vision applications but remain heavily reliant on
large-scale labeled datasets for training. In this work, we present a
systematic study of contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) as a means to
reduce this dependency by pretraining YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 backbones on unlabeled
images using the SimCLR framework. Our approach introduces a simple yet
effective pipeline that adapts YOLO's convolutional backbones as encoders,
employs global pooling and projection heads, and optimizes a contrastive loss
using augmentations of the COCO unlabeled dataset (120k images). The pretrained
backbones are then fine-tuned on a cyclist detection task with limited labeled
data. Experimental results show that SSL pretraining leads to consistently
higher mAP, faster convergence, and improved precision-recall performance,
especially in low-label regimes. For example, our SimCLR-pretrained YOLOv8
achieves a mAP@50:95 of 0.7663, outperforming its supervised counterpart
despite using no annotations during pretraining. These findings establish a
strong baseline for applying contrastive SSL to one-stage detectors and
highlight the potential of unlabeled data as a scalable resource for
label-efficient object detection.

Abstract: Point clouds are essential for object modeling and play a critical role in
assisting driving tasks for autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, the significant
volume of data generated by AVs creates challenges for storage, bandwidth, and
processing cost. To tackle these challenges, we propose a representative point
selection framework for point cloud downsampling, which preserves critical
object-related information while effectively filtering out irrelevant
background points. Our method involves two steps: (1) Object Presence
Detection, where we introduce an unsupervised density peak-based classifier and
a supervised Na\"ive Bayes classifier to handle diverse scenarios, and (2)
Sampling Budget Allocation, where we propose a strategy that selects
object-relevant points while maintaining a high retention rate of object
information. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
in both efficiency and effectiveness across varying sampling rates. As a
model-agnostic solution, our approach integrates seamlessly with diverse
downstream models, making it a valuable and scalable addition to the 3D point

Abstract: Existing human motion Q\&A methods rely on explicit program execution, where
the requirement for manually defined functional modules may limit the
scalability and adaptability. To overcome this, we propose an implicit
program-guided motion reasoning (IMoRe) framework that unifies reasoning across
multiple query types without manually designed modules. Unlike existing
implicit reasoning approaches that infer reasoning operations from question
words, our model directly conditions on structured program functions, ensuring
a more precise execution of reasoning steps. Additionally, we introduce a
program-guided reading mechanism, which dynamically selects multi-level motion
representations from a pretrained motion Vision Transformer (ViT), capturing
both high-level semantics and fine-grained motion cues. The reasoning module
iteratively refines memory representations, leveraging structured program
functions to extract relevant information for different query types. Our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on Babel-QA and generalizes to a newly
constructed motion Q\&A dataset based on HuMMan, demonstrating its adaptability
across different motion reasoning datasets. Code and dataset are available at:

Abstract: As the application of deep learning in dermatology continues to grow, the
recognition of melanoma has garnered significant attention, demonstrating
potential for improving diagnostic accuracy. Despite advancements in image
classification techniques, existing models still face challenges in identifying
subtle visual cues that differentiate melanoma from benign lesions. This paper
presents a novel Deeply Dual Supervised Learning framework that integrates
local and global feature extraction to enhance melanoma recognition. By
employing a dual-pathway structure, the model focuses on both fine-grained
local features and broader contextual information, ensuring a comprehensive
understanding of the image content. The framework utilizes a dual attention
mechanism that dynamically emphasizes critical features, thereby reducing the
risk of overlooking subtle characteristics of melanoma. Additionally, we
introduce a multi-scale feature aggregation strategy to ensure robust
performance across varying image resolutions. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in melanoma detection, achieving higher accuracy and
better resilience against false positives. This work lays the foundation for
future research in automated skin cancer recognition and highlights the
effectiveness of dual supervised learning in medical image analysis.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于二维函数和Quasi-Fresnel变换的NLOS成像方法，显著降低计算复杂度和内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因忽略隐藏物体的二维特性导致计算成本高，限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用二维函数表示隐藏场景，并利用Quasi-Fresnel变换建立直接反演公式。

Result: 算法显著减少运行时间和内存需求，同时保持成像质量。

Conclusion: 该方法有望实现实时高分辨率NLOS成像，并扩展其应用平台范围。

Abstract: Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging seeks to reconstruct hidden objects by
analyzing reflections from intermediary surfaces. Existing methods typically
model both the measurement data and the hidden scene in three dimensions,
overlooking the inherently two-dimensional nature of most hidden objects. This
oversight leads to high computational costs and substantial memory consumption,
limiting practical applications and making real-time, high-resolution NLOS
imaging on lightweight devices challenging. In this paper, we introduce a novel
approach that represents the hidden scene using two-dimensional functions and
employs a Quasi-Fresnel transform to establish a direct inversion formula
between the measurement data and the hidden scene. This transformation
leverages the two-dimensional characteristics of the problem to significantly
reduce computational complexity and memory requirements. Our algorithm
efficiently performs fast transformations between these two-dimensional
aggregated data, enabling rapid reconstruction of hidden objects with minimal
memory usage. Compared to existing methods, our approach reduces runtime and
memory demands by several orders of magnitude while maintaining imaging
quality. The substantial reduction in memory usage not only enhances
computational efficiency but also enables NLOS imaging on lightweight devices
such as mobile and embedded systems. We anticipate that this method will
facilitate real-time, high-resolution NLOS imaging and broaden its
applicability across a wider range of platforms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的自注意力修改方法（Stratified Attention），解决了现有图像提示生成方法中的冲突信号问题，并通过平衡生成图像的逼真度与图像提示的对齐性，提升了生成效果。


<details>

Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型在捕捉复杂细节（如纹理）时表现不佳，导致用户意图无法准确反映。虽然已有方法通过修改自注意力机制引入图像提示，但仍存在分类器自由引导中的冲突信号问题以及逼真度与对齐性的权衡问题。

Method: 提出冲突自由引导（conflict-free guidance），仅将图像提示作为期望条件；设计分层注意力（Stratified Attention），联合使用来自生成图像和图像提示的键值对，而非二选一。

Result: 在三个图像生成任务上的实验表明，该方法在忠实反映图像提示方面优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 通过解决冲突信号和平衡逼真度与对齐性，提出的方法显著提升了图像提示生成的效果。

Abstract: While large-scale text-to-image diffusion models enable the generation of
high-quality, diverse images from text prompts, these prompts struggle to
capture intricate details, such as textures, preventing the user intent from
being reflected. This limitation has led to efforts to generate images
conditioned on user-provided images, referred to as image prompts. Recent work
modifies the self-attention mechanism to impose image conditions in generated
images by replacing or concatenating the keys and values from the image prompt.
This enables the self-attention layer to work like a cross-attention layer,
generally used to incorporate text prompts. In this paper, we identify two
common issues in existing methods of modifying self-attention to generate
images that reflect the details of image prompts. First, existing approaches
neglect the importance of image prompts in classifier-free guidance.
Specifically, current methods use image prompts as both desired and undesired
conditions in classifier-free guidance, causing conflicting signals. To resolve
this, we propose conflict-free guidance by using image prompts only as desired
conditions, ensuring that the generated image faithfully reflects the image
prompt. In addition, we observe that the two most common self-attention
modifications involve a trade-off between the realism of the generated image
and alignment with the image prompt. Specifically, selecting more keys and
values from the image prompt improves alignment, while selecting more from the
generated image enhances realism. To balance both, we propose an new
self-attention modification method, Stratified Attention to jointly use keys
and values from both images rather than selecting between them. Through
extensive experiments across three image generation tasks, we show that the
proposed method outperforms existing image-prompting models in faithfully
reflecting the image prompt.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估方法局限于静态输入的开环设置，缺乏对交互行为和实际安全性的评估。

Method: 采用双系统适应架构，将高级驾驶命令转化为可执行的模拟动作，并通过物理控制抽象层实现真实车辆测试。

Result: 实验验证了框架的诊断能力，显示现有模型在闭环条件下性能有限。

Conclusion: Bench2ADVLM为自动驾驶视觉语言模型提供了更全面的评估方法，揭示了现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm
in autonomous driving (AD). However, current performance evaluation protocols
for VLM-based AD systems (ADVLMs) are predominantly confined to open-loop
settings with static inputs, neglecting the more realistic and informative
closed-loop setting that captures interactive behavior, feedback resilience,
and real-world safety. To address this, we introduce Bench2ADVLM, a unified
hierarchical closed-loop evaluation framework for real-time, interactive
assessment of ADVLMs across both simulation and physical platforms. Inspired by
dual-process theories of cognition, we first adapt diverse ADVLMs to simulation
environments via a dual-system adaptation architecture. In this design,
heterogeneous high-level driving commands generated by target ADVLMs (fast
system) are interpreted by a general-purpose VLM (slow system) into
standardized mid-level control actions suitable for execution in simulation. To
bridge the gap between simulation and reality, we design a physical control
abstraction layer that translates these mid-level actions into low-level
actuation signals, enabling, for the first time, closed-loop testing of ADVLMs
on physical vehicles. To enable more comprehensive evaluation, Bench2ADVLM
introduces a self-reflective scenario generation module that automatically
explores model behavior and uncovers potential failure modes for
safety-critical scenario generation. Overall, Bench2ADVLM establishes a
hierarchical evaluation pipeline that seamlessly integrates high-level abstract
reasoning, mid-level simulation actions, and low-level real-world execution.
Experiments on diverse scenarios across multiple state-of-the-art ADVLMs and
physical platforms validate the diagnostic strength of our framework, revealing
that existing ADVLMs still exhibit limited performance under closed-loop
conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Protego是一种用户中心的隐私保护方法，通过动态变形3D面具保护面部图像，防止基于检索的隐私侵犯。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对面部识别技术滥用导致的隐私问题，如未经同意的身份推断和数字足迹暴露。

Method: 将用户的3D面部特征封装为姿态不变的2D表示，并动态变形为自然3D面具，应用于在线分享前的图像。

Result: 实验显示Protego显著降低检索准确率，性能优于现有方法至少2倍，并提供视觉一致性。

Conclusion: Protego有效对抗面部识别技术的滥用，保护用户隐私。

Abstract: Face recognition (FR) technologies are increasingly used to power large-scale
image retrieval systems, raising serious privacy concerns. Services like
Clearview AI and PimEyes allow anyone to upload a facial photo and retrieve a
large amount of online content associated with that person. This not only
enables identity inference but also exposes their digital footprint, such as
social media activity, private photos, and news reports, often without their
consent. In response to this emerging threat, we propose Protego, a
user-centric privacy protection method that safeguards facial images from such
retrieval-based privacy intrusions. Protego encapsulates a user's 3D facial
signatures into a pose-invariant 2D representation, which is dynamically
deformed into a natural-looking 3D mask tailored to the pose and expression of
any facial image of the user, and applied prior to online sharing. Motivated by
a critical limitation of existing methods, Protego amplifies the sensitivity of
FR models so that protected images cannot be matched even among themselves.
Experiments show that Protego significantly reduces retrieval accuracy across a
wide range of black-box FR models and performs at least 2x better than existing
methods. It also offers unprecedented visual coherence, particularly in video
settings where consistency and natural appearance are essential. Overall,
Protego contributes to the fight against the misuse of FR for mass surveillance
and unsolicited identity tracing.

TL;DR: ADDiff-Dose是一种基于条件扩散模型的放疗剂量预测方法，显著提高了预测精度和临床适用性，减少了计划生成时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统放疗计划依赖专家经验耗时且现有深度学习方法泛化性和准确性不足的问题。

Method: 采用LightweightVAE3D压缩CT数据，结合多模态输入和渐进噪声去噪框架，使用多头注意力机制和复合损失函数。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于基线模型，MAE降至0.101-0.154，DICE系数提高6.8%，计划生成时间缩短至22秒。

Conclusion: ADDiff-Dose为放疗剂量预测提供了通用高效的解决方案，可显著提升临床工作效率。

Abstract: Radiotherapy treatment planning often relies on time-consuming,
trial-and-error adjustments that heavily depend on the expertise of
specialists, while existing deep learning methods face limitations in
generalization, prediction accuracy, and clinical applicability. To tackle
these challenges, we propose ADDiff-Dose, an Anatomical-Dose Dual Constraints
Conditional Diffusion Model for end-to-end multi-tumor dose prediction. The
model employs LightweightVAE3D to compress high-dimensional CT data and
integrates multimodal inputs, including target and organ-at-risk (OAR) masks
and beam parameters, within a progressive noise addition and denoising
framework. It incorporates conditional features via a multi-head attention
mechanism and utilizes a composite loss function combining MSE, conditional
terms, and KL divergence to ensure both dosimetric accuracy and compliance with
clinical constraints. Evaluation on a large-scale public dataset (2,877 cases)
and three external institutional cohorts (450 cases in total) demonstrates that
ADDiff-Dose significantly outperforms traditional baselines, achieving an MAE
of 0.101-0.154 (compared to 0.316 for UNet and 0.169 for GAN models), a DICE
coefficient of 0.927 (a 6.8% improvement), and limiting spinal cord maximum
dose error to within 0.1 Gy. The average plan generation time per case is
reduced to 22 seconds. Ablation studies confirm that the structural encoder
enhances compliance with clinical dose constraints by 28.5%. To our knowledge,
this is the first study to introduce a conditional diffusion model framework
for radiotherapy dose prediction, offering a generalizable and efficient
solution for automated treatment planning across diverse tumor sites, with the
potential to substantially reduce planning time and improve clinical workflow
efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集（如Mapillary）的标签粒度较粗，无法区分语义重要的交通标志类型，影响了自动驾驶决策的准确性。

Method: 通过分解复合交通标志为细粒度类别，构建了MVV数据集，并手动标注像素级实例掩码。同时，比较了DINOv2与多种视觉语言模型（VLM）的性能。

Result: DINOv2在交通标志识别及其他类别（如车辆和行人）上表现优于所有VLM基线。

Conclusion: MVV数据集和DINOv2为自动驾驶场景中的细粒度视觉理解提供了可靠基准，推动了更可解释和可扩展的感知系统发展。

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality fine-grained annotations for traffic signs is critical
for accurate and safe decision-making in autonomous driving. Widely used
datasets, such as Mapillary, often provide only coarse-grained labels - without
distinguishing semantically important types such as stop signs or speed limit
signs. To this end, we present a new validation set for traffic signs derived
from the Mapillary dataset called Mapillary Vistas Validation for Traffic Signs
(MVV), where we decompose composite traffic signs into granular, semantically
meaningful categories. The dataset includes pixel-level instance masks and has
been manually annotated by expert annotators to ensure label fidelity. Further,
we benchmark several state-of-the-art VLMs against the self-supervised DINOv2
model on this dataset and show that DINOv2 consistently outperforms all VLM
baselines-not only on traffic sign recognition, but also on heavily represented
categories like vehicles and humans. Our analysis reveals significant
limitations in current vision-language models for fine-grained visual
understanding and establishes DINOv2 as a strong baseline for dense semantic
matching in autonomous driving scenarios. This dataset and evaluation framework
pave the way for more reliable, interpretable, and scalable perception systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种分层级联框架（HCF），通过直接潜在空间转换优化分布式多阶段图像压缩的性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分布式多阶段图像压缩中渐进方法计算资源利用不足、连续压缩效率低且质量损失累积的问题。

Method: 采用HCF框架，引入策略驱动的量化控制和边缘量化原则，优化率失真权衡。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，PSNR增益最高达0.6dB，计算资源节省显著（如97.8% FLOPs）。

Conclusion: HCF在性能和效率上优于现有方法，支持无重训练的质量自适应。

Abstract: Distributed multi-stage image compression -- where visual content traverses
multiple processing nodes under varying quality requirements -- poses
challenges. Progressive methods enable bitstream truncation but underutilize
available compute resources; successive compression repeats costly pixel-domain
operations and suffers cumulative quality loss and inefficiency;
fixed-parameter models lack post-encoding flexibility. In this work, we
developed the Hierarchical Cascade Framework (HCF) that achieves high
rate-distortion performance and better computational efficiency through direct
latent-space transformations across network nodes in distributed multi-stage
image compression system. Under HCF, we introduced policy-driven quantization
control to optimize rate-distortion trade-offs, and established the edge
quantization principle through differential entropy analysis. The configuration
based on this principle demonstrates up to 0.6dB PSNR gains over other
configurations. When comprehensively evaluated on the Kodak, CLIC, and
CLIC2020-mobile datasets, HCF outperforms successive-compression methods by up
to 5.56% BD-Rate in PSNR on CLIC, while saving up to 97.8% FLOPs, 96.5% GPU
memory, and 90.0% execution time. It also outperforms state-of-the-art
progressive compression methods by up to 12.64% BD-Rate on Kodak and enables
retraining-free cross-quality adaptation with 7.13-10.87% BD-Rate reductions on
CLIC2020-mobile.

Motivation: 传统方法在单目3D人体姿态估计中存在深度模糊和遮挡问题，而现有扩散方法缺乏时空相关性建模，导致时间一致性差和精度不足。

Method: StarPose将2D到3D姿态映射建模为自回归扩散过程，通过历史姿态集成模块（HPIM）和时空物理引导机制（STPG）提升预测质量。

Result: 在基准数据集上，StarPose优于现有方法，实现了更高的准确性和时间一致性。

Conclusion: StarPose通过自回归扩散和时空引导，显著提升了3D姿态估计的性能，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a challenging task due to inherent
depth ambiguities and occlusions. Compared to traditional methods based on
Transformers or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recent diffusion-based
approaches have shown superior performance, leveraging their probabilistic
nature and high-fidelity generation capabilities. However, these methods often
fail to account for the spatial and temporal correlations across predicted
frames, resulting in limited temporal consistency and inferior accuracy in
predicted 3D pose sequences. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes
StarPose, an autoregressive diffusion framework that effectively incorporates
historical 3D pose predictions and spatial-temporal physical guidance to
significantly enhance both the accuracy and temporal coherence of pose
predictions. Unlike existing approaches, StarPose models the 2D-to-3D pose
mapping as an autoregressive diffusion process. By synergically integrating
previously predicted 3D poses with 2D pose inputs via a Historical Pose
Integration Module (HPIM), the framework generates rich and informative
historical pose embeddings that guide subsequent denoising steps, ensuring
temporally consistent predictions. In addition, a fully plug-and-play
Spatial-Temporal Physical Guidance (STPG) mechanism is tailored to refine the
denoising process in an iterative manner, which further enforces spatial
anatomical plausibility and temporal motion dynamics, rendering robust and
realistic pose estimates. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that StarPose outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving
superior accuracy and temporal consistency in 3D human pose estimation. Code is

Conclusion: 结构化报告生成方法及其评估框架显著提升了报告的临床相关性和质量，为临床决策提供了更可靠的依据。

Abstract: Radiology report generation (RRG) for diagnostic images, such as chest
X-rays, plays a pivotal role in both clinical practice and AI. Traditional
free-text reports suffer from redundancy and inconsistent language,
complicating the extraction of critical clinical details. Structured radiology
report generation (S-RRG) offers a promising solution by organizing information
into standardized, concise formats. However, existing approaches often rely on
classification or visual question answering (VQA) pipelines that require
predefined label sets and produce only fragmented outputs. Template-based
approaches, which generate reports by replacing keywords within fixed sentence
patterns, further compromise expressiveness and often omit clinically important
details. In this work, we present a novel approach to S-RRG that includes
dataset construction, model training, and the introduction of a new evaluation
framework. We first create a robust chest X-ray dataset (MIMIC-STRUC) that
includes disease names, severity levels, probabilities, and anatomical
locations, ensuring that the dataset is both clinically relevant and
well-structured. We train an LLM-based model to generate standardized,
high-quality reports. To assess the generated reports, we propose a specialized
evaluation metric (S-Score) that not only measures disease prediction accuracy
but also evaluates the precision of disease-specific details, thus offering a
clinically meaningful metric for report quality that focuses on elements
critical to clinical decision-making and demonstrates a stronger alignment with
human assessments. Our approach highlights the effectiveness of structured
reports and the importance of a tailored evaluation metric for S-RRG, providing
a more clinically relevant measure of report quality.

Conclusion: 通过4D特征场重建和针对性监督微调等方法，展示了提升VLMs时空理解的潜力，为动态环境中的视觉智能发展铺路。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in
integrating linguistic and visual reasoning but remain fundamentally limited in
understanding dynamic spatiotemporal interactions. Humans effortlessly track
and reason about object movements, rotations, and perspective shifts-abilities
essential for robust dynamic real-world understanding yet notably lacking in
current VLMs. In this paper, we introduce VLM4D, the first benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate the spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities of
VLMs. Our benchmark comprises diverse real-world and synthetic videos
accompanied by carefully curated question-answer pairs emphasizing
translational and rotational motions, perspective awareness, and motion
continuity. Through comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art open and
closed-source VLMs, we identify significant performance gaps compared to human
baselines, highlighting fundamental deficiencies in existing models. Extensive
analysis reveals that VLMs struggle particularly with integrating multiple
visual cues and maintaining temporal coherence. We further explore promising
directions, such as leveraging 4D feature field reconstruction and targeted
spatiotemporal supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating their effectiveness in
enhancing spatiotemporal comprehension. Our work aims to encourage deeper
exploration into improving VLMs' spatial and temporal grounding, paving the way
towards more capable and reliable visual intelligence for dynamic environments.

immersive and physically plausible human interactions across diverse entities,
including human-avatar, human-humanoid, and human-robot systems. Unlike
existing approaches that focus on post-hoc alignment or simplified physics, our
method jointly predicts actions and reactions in real-time using an
auto-regressive reaction diffusion planner, ensuring seamless synchronization
and context-aware responses. To enhance physical realism and safety, we
integrate an actor-aware motion tracking policy trained with reinforcement
learning, which dynamically adapts to interaction partners' movements while
avoiding artifacts like foot sliding and penetration. Extensive experiments on
the Inter-X and InterHuman datasets demonstrate significant improvements in
motion quality, interaction continuity, and physical plausibility over
state-of-the-art methods. Our framework is validated in real-world
applications, including virtual reality interface for human-robot interaction,
showcasing its potential for advancing human-robot collaboration.

*Zhiwen Li,Zhongjie Duan,Die Chen,Cen Chen,Daoyuan Chen,Yaliang Li,Yingda Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新框架，通过语义驱动的LoRA检索和动态聚合，解决了分布式开源LoRA模块的三大挑战，显著提升了图像生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型模型在图像生成方面取得了进展，但实际部署仍受限于参数微调的困难。LoRA虽有效，但面临稀疏元数据标注、零样本适应需求和多LoRA融合策略的挑战。

Method: 框架包括基于权重编码的LoRA检索器和细粒度门控融合机制，前者建立共享语义空间，后者优化多LoRA模块的融合。

Result: 显著提升了图像生成性能，支持基础模型的可扩展和数据高效增强。

Conclusion: 该工作为社区开发的LoRA与实际部署需求之间建立了桥梁，通过标准化适配器集成实现协作模型演进。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in photorealistic image generation through
large-scale models like FLUX and Stable Diffusion v3, the practical deployment
of these architectures remains constrained by their inherent intractability to
parameter fine-tuning. While low-rank adaptation (LoRA) have demonstrated
efficacy in enabling model customization with minimal parameter overhead, the
effective utilization of distributed open-source LoRA modules faces three
critical challenges: sparse metadata annotation, the requirement for zero-shot
adaptation capabilities, and suboptimal fusion strategies for multi-LoRA fusion
strategies. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that
enables semantic-driven LoRA retrieval and dynamic aggregation through two key
components: (1) weight encoding-base LoRA retriever that establishes a shared
semantic space between LoRA parameter matrices and text prompts, eliminating
dependence on original training data, and (2) fine-grained gated fusion
mechanism that computes context-specific fusion weights across network layers
and diffusion timesteps to optimally integrate multiple LoRA modules during
generation. Our approach achieves significant improvement in image generation
perfermance, thereby facilitating scalable and data-efficient enhancement of
foundational models. This work establishes a critical bridge between the
fragmented landscape of community-developed LoRAs and practical deployment
requirements, enabling collaborative model evolution through standardized
adapter integration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeflareMamba提出了一种基于状态空间模型的镜头光晕去除方法，通过分层框架和局部增强的状态空间模型，有效解决了光晕去除中的上下文一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 镜头光晕去除因光晕与背景信息的复杂光学交互而具有挑战性，现有方法在保持上下文一致性方面表现不足。

Method: 采用分层框架和局部增强的状态空间模型，通过变步长采样模式建立长距离像素关联，同时保留局部细节。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效去除多种光晕（如散射和反射光晕），并保持非光晕区域的自然外观。

Conclusion: DeflareMamba首次将状态空间模型引入光晕去除任务，并在下游视觉任务中展示了其潜力。

Abstract: Lens flare removal remains an information confusion challenge in the
underlying image background and the optical flares, due to the complex optical
interactions between light sources and camera lens. While recent solutions have
shown promise in decoupling the flare corruption from image, they often fail to
maintain contextual consistency, leading to incomplete and inconsistent flare
removal. To eliminate this limitation, we propose DeflareMamba, which leverages
the efficient sequence modeling capabilities of state space models while
maintains the ability to capture local-global dependencies. Particularly, we
design a hierarchical framework that establishes long-range pixel correlations
through varied stride sampling patterns, and utilize local-enhanced state space
models that simultaneously preserves local details. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that introduces state space models to the
flare removal task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
effectively removes various types of flare artifacts, including scattering and
reflective flares, while maintaining the natural appearance of non-flare
regions. Further downstream applications demonstrate the capacity of our method
to improve visual object recognition and cross-modal semantic understanding.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态检测框架NRE-Net，结合RGB图像、事件流和预测的法线图，通过自适应融合模块提升恶劣光照条件下的物体检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶劣光照条件下（如自动驾驶场景），现有RGB或事件相机单独使用无法有效处理反射干扰，导致误检。

Method: 提出NRE-Net框架，融合RGB、事件流和预测的法线图，采用ADFM和EAFM模块优化多模态特征融合。

Result: 在DSEC-Det-sub和PKU-DAVIS-SOD数据集上，mAP50分别提升7.9%/6.1%和2.7%/7.1%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NRE-Net通过多模态融合显著提升恶劣光照下的检测鲁棒性，为实际应用提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate object detection under adverse lighting conditions is critical for
real-world applications such as autonomous driving. Although neuromorphic event
cameras have been introduced to handle these scenarios, adverse lighting often
induces distracting reflections from tunnel walls or road surfaces, which
frequently lead to false obstacle detections. However, neither RGB nor event
data alone is robust enough to address these complexities, and mitigating these
issues without additional sensors remains underexplored. To overcome these
challenges, we propose leveraging normal maps, directly predicted from
monocular RGB images, as robust geometric cues to suppress false positives and
enhance detection accuracy. We introduce NRE-Net, a novel multi-modal detection
framework that effectively fuses three complementary modalities: monocularly
predicted surface normal maps, RGB images, and event streams. To optimize the
fusion process, our framework incorporates two key modules: the Adaptive
Dual-stream Fusion Module (ADFM), which integrates RGB and normal map features,
and the Event-modality Aware Fusion Module (EAFM), which adapts to the high
dynamic range characteristics of event data. Extensive evaluations on the
DSEC-Det-sub and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate that NRE-Net significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our approach achieves mAP50 improvements
of 7.9% and 6.1% over frame-based approaches (e.g., YOLOX), while surpassing
the fusion-based SFNet by 2.7% on the DSEC-Det-sub dataset and SODFormer by
7.1% on the PKU-DAVIS-SOD dataset.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视频扩散增强的4D高斯泼溅框架，通过时间一致性和姿态优化显著提升动态场景建模效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预校准对象轨迹或难以处理快速移动对象，导致时间不连续性和建模不准确。

Method: 结合视频扩散模型提取时间一致先验，引入联合时间戳优化和不确定性蒸馏方法。

Result: 实验表明，新方法显著提升动态建模效果，PSNR增益约2 dB。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了动态场景建模中的时间不连续性和快速移动对象问题。

Abstract: Dynamic urban scene modeling is a rapidly evolving area with broad
applications. While current approaches leveraging neural radiance fields or
Gaussian Splatting have achieved fine-grained reconstruction and high-fidelity
novel view synthesis, they still face significant limitations. These often stem
from a dependence on pre-calibrated object tracks or difficulties in accurately
modeling fast-moving objects from undersampled capture, particularly due to
challenges in handling temporal discontinuities. To overcome these issues, we
propose a novel video diffusion-enhanced 4D Gaussian Splatting framework. Our
key insight is to distill robust, temporally consistent priors from a test-time
adapted video diffusion model. To ensure precise pose alignment and effective
integration of this denoised content, we introduce two core innovations: a
joint timestamp optimization strategy that refines interpolated frame poses,
and an uncertainty distillation method that adaptively extracts target content
while preserving well-reconstructed regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method significantly enhances dynamic modeling, especially for
fast-moving objects, achieving an approximate PSNR gain of 2 dB for novel view
synthesis over baseline approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于感知的神经网络质量度量方法，用于评估BRDF模型，直接操作于BRDF空间，无需渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统BRDF空间度量方法无法捕捉渲染图像中的感知差异，需要一种更准确的评估方法。

Method: 使用多层感知机（MLP）实现度量，训练数据包括实测BRDF和合成数据，标签基于感知验证的图像空间度量。

Result: 该神经网络度量与人类判断的相关性显著高于现有BRDF空间度量。

Conclusion: 该方法为BRDF模型评估提供了基于感知的替代方案，但在BRDF拟合中作为损失函数的性能有限。

Abstract: Accurately evaluating the quality of bidirectional reflectance distribution
function (BRDF) models is essential for photo-realistic rendering. Traditional
BRDF-space metrics often employ numerical error measures that fail to capture
perceptual differences evident in rendered images. In this paper, we introduce
the first perceptually informed neural quality metric for BRDF evaluation that
operates directly in BRDF space, eliminating the need for rendering during
quality assessment. Our metric is implemented as a compact multi-layer
perceptron (MLP), trained on a dataset of measured BRDFs supplemented with
synthetically generated data and labelled using a perceptually validated
image-space metric. The network takes as input paired samples of reference and
approximated BRDFs and predicts their perceptual quality in terms of
just-objectionable-difference (JOD) scores. We show that our neural metric
achieves significantly higher correlation with human judgments than existing
BRDF-space metrics. While its performance as a loss function for BRDF fitting
remains limited, the proposed metric offers a perceptually grounded alternative
for evaluating BRDF models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Free-MoRef是一种无需训练的方法，通过多参考注意力机制和并行处理长视频帧，显著提升了视频多模态大语言模型（Video-MLLM）在长视频场景下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Video-MLLMs因底层LLMs的上下文长度限制，在长视频场景中表现不佳，常见解决方案牺牲了特征粒度或推理效率。

Method: 提出Free-MoRef，通过重构视觉令牌为多参考短序列，并行处理并融合关键令牌，实现高效长视频理解。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Free-MoRef支持2倍至8倍更长的输入帧，性能显著提升，甚至超越专门训练的长视频模型。

Conclusion: Free-MoRef以低计算成本实现了长视频的高效全面理解，为视频理解任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Video Multimodal Large Language Models~(Video-MLLM) have achieved remarkable
advancements in video understanding tasks. However, constrained by the context
length limitation in the underlying LLMs, existing Video-MLLMs typically
exhibit suboptimal performance on long video scenarios. To understand extended
input frames, common solutions span token compression and streaming inference
techniques, which sacrifice feature granularity or inference efficiency.
Differently, to efficiently achieve comprehensive understanding of longer frame
inputs, we draw ideas from MoE and propose a training-free approach
\textbf{Free-MoRef}, which instantly multiplexes the context perception
capabilities of Video-MLLMs within one inference pass. Specifically, Free-MoRef
reconstructs the vision tokens into several short sequences as
multi-references. Subsequently, we introduce MoRef-attention, which gathers
clues from the multi-reference chunks in parallel to summarize unified query
activations. After the shadow layers in LLMs, a reference fusion step is
derived to compose a final mixed reasoning sequence with key tokens from
parallel chunks, which compensates the cross-reference vision interactions that
are neglected in MoRef-attention. By splitting and fusing the long vision token
sequences, Free-MoRef achieves improved performance under much lower computing
costs in reasoning multiplexed context length, demonstrating strong efficiency
and effectiveness. Experiments on VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench show that
Free-MoRef achieves full perception of 2$\times$ to 8$\times$ longer input
frames without compression on a single A100 GPU while keeping instant
responses, thereby bringing significant performance gains, even surpassing
dedicatedly trained long-video-MLLMs. Codes are available at

Motivation: 研究航拍图像如何为自动驾驶车辆提供环境上下文，尤其是在高清地图不可用或维护成本高的情况下。

Method: 使用SLAM点云地图将航拍图像与nuScenes坐标系对齐，提出校正定位和投影失真的工作流程，并通过人工质量控制优化数据集。

Result: 航拍图像使地图构建准确率提升15-23%，轨迹预测性能提高2%。

Conclusion: 航拍图像是自动驾驶系统中可扩展且适应性强的环境信息来源，AID4AD数据集的发布将促进相关研究。

Abstract: This work investigates the integration of spatially aligned aerial imagery
into perception tasks for automated vehicles (AVs). As a central contribution,
we present AID4AD, a publicly available dataset that augments the nuScenes
dataset with high-resolution aerial imagery precisely aligned to its local
coordinate system. The alignment is performed using SLAM-based point cloud maps
provided by nuScenes, establishing a direct link between aerial data and
nuScenes local coordinate system. To ensure spatial fidelity, we propose an
alignment workflow that corrects for localization and projection distortions. A
manual quality control process further refines the dataset by identifying a set
of high-quality alignments, which we publish as ground truth to support future
research on automated registration. We demonstrate the practical value of
AID4AD in two representative tasks: in online map construction, aerial imagery
serves as a complementary input that improves the mapping process; in motion
prediction, it functions as a structured environmental representation that
replaces high-definition maps. Experiments show that aerial imagery leads to a
15-23% improvement in map construction accuracy and a 2% gain in trajectory
prediction performance. These results highlight the potential of aerial imagery
as a scalable and adaptable source of environmental context in automated
vehicle systems, particularly in scenarios where high-definition maps are
unavailable, outdated, or costly to maintain. AID4AD, along with evaluation
code and pretrained models, is publicly released to foster further research in
this direction: https://github.com/DriverlessMobility/AID4AD.

Method: 提出TrackletGait框架，包括随机轨迹采样、Haar小波下采样和硬度排除三元组损失。

Result: 在Gait3D和GREW数据集上分别达到77.8和80.4的rank-1准确率，仅使用10.3M参数。

Conclusion: TrackletGait在真实场景中表现出色，为步态识别提供了新思路。

Abstract: Gait recognition aims to identify individuals based on their body shape and
walking patterns. Though much progress has been achieved driven by deep
learning, gait recognition in real-world surveillance scenarios remains quite
challenging to current methods. Conventional approaches, which rely on periodic
gait cycles and controlled environments, struggle with the non-periodic and
occluded silhouette sequences encountered in the wild. In this paper, we
propose a novel framework, TrackletGait, designed to address these challenges
in the wild. We propose Random Tracklet Sampling, a generalization of existing
sampling methods, which strikes a balance between robustness and representation
in capturing diverse walking patterns. Next, we introduce Haar Wavelet-based
Downsampling to preserve information during spatial downsampling. Finally, we
present a Hardness Exclusion Triplet Loss, designed to exclude low-quality
silhouettes by discarding hard triplet samples. TrackletGait achieves
state-of-the-art results, with 77.8 and 80.4 rank-1 accuracy on the Gait3D and
GREW datasets, respectively, while using only 10.3M backbone parameters.
Extensive experiments are also conducted to further investigate the factors
affecting gait recognition in the wild.

Motivation: 现有方法缺乏真正的语义理解，且联合训练推理和分割会降低像素级精度。

Method: 采用思维链提示机制和分割特征蒸馏损失，分两阶段训练：自校正增强推理路径，强化学习提升鲁棒性。

Result: AURORA在Ref-AVS基准测试中达到最优性能，并能泛化到未参考的分割任务。

Conclusion: AURORA通过增强推理能力和语言理解，解决了现有方法的局限性，并在性能上取得突破。

Abstract: Reference Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) tasks challenge models to
precisely locate sounding objects by integrating visual, auditory, and textual
cues. Existing methods often lack genuine semantic understanding, tending to
memorize fixed reasoning patterns. Furthermore, jointly training for reasoning
and segmentation can compromise pixel-level precision. To address these issues,
we introduce AURORA, a novel framework designed to enhance genuine reasoning
and language comprehension in reference audio-visual segmentation. We employ a
structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting mechanism to guide the model
through a step-by-step reasoning process and introduce a novel segmentation
feature distillation loss to effectively integrate these reasoning abilities
without sacrificing segmentation performance. To further cultivate the model's
genuine reasoning capabilities, we devise a further two-stage training
strategy: first, a ``corrective reflective-style training" stage utilizes
self-correction to enhance the quality of reasoning paths, followed by
reinforcement learning via Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to bolster
robustness in challenging scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that AURORA
achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ref-AVS benchmarks and generalizes
effectively to unreferenced segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖模糊的文本提示或昂贵的人类偏好数据，难以实现精细的美学控制。

Method: 通过预训练的视觉语言模型量化美学，并使用轻量级值编码器将强度映射到可学习的嵌入中。

Result: AttriCtrl实现了对单个属性的精确控制和多属性的灵活组合，且与现有生成框架兼容。

Conclusion: AttriCtrl具有高效、直观的特点，适用于多样化的生成场景。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in text-to-image diffusion models have significantly
enhanced both the visual fidelity and semantic controllability of generated
images. However, fine-grained control over aesthetic attributes remains
challenging, especially when users require continuous and intensity-specific
adjustments. Existing approaches often rely on vague textual prompts, which are
inherently ambiguous in expressing both the aesthetic semantics and the desired
intensity, or depend on costly human preference data for alignment, limiting
their scalability and practicality. To address these limitations, we propose
AttriCtrl, a plug-and-play framework for precise and continuous control of
aesthetic attributes. Specifically, we quantify abstract aesthetics by
leveraging semantic similarity from pre-trained vision-language models, and
employ a lightweight value encoder that maps scalar intensities in $[0,1]$ to
learnable embeddings within diffusion-based generation. This design enables
intuitive and customizable aesthetic manipulation, with minimal training
overhead and seamless integration into existing generation pipelines. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AttriCtrl achieves accurate control over
individual attributes as well as flexible multi-attribute composition.
Moreover, it is fully compatible with popular open-source controllable
generation frameworks, showcasing strong integration capability and practical
utility across diverse generation scenarios.

Result: 在无噪声图像上，新方法与ADMM方法效果相当；在高斯噪声污染图像上，新方法表现更优。

Conclusion: 提出的CP框架方法在效率和效果上优于ADMM方法，尤其在噪声去除方面表现突出。

Abstract: Recently convolutional sparse representation (CSR), as a sparse
representation technique, has attracted increasing attention in the field of
image processing, due to its good characteristic of translate-invariance. The
content of CSR usually consists of convolutional sparse coding (CSC) and
convolutional dictionary learning (CDL), and many studies focus on how to solve
the corresponding optimization problems. At present, the most efficient
optimization scheme for CSC is based on the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM). However, the ADMM-based approach involves a penalty
parameter that needs to be carefully selected, and improper parameter selection
may result in either no convergence or very slow convergence. In this paper, a
novel fast and efficient method using Chambolle-Pock(CP) framework is proposed,
which does not require extra manual selection parameters in solving processing,
and has faster convergence speed. Furthermore, we propose an anisotropic total
variation penalty of the coefficient maps for CSC and apply the CP algorithm to
solve it. In addition, we also apply the CP framework to solve the
corresponding CDL problem. Experiments show that for noise-free image the
proposed CSC algorithms can achieve rival results of the latest ADMM-based
approach, while outperforms in removing noise from Gaussian noise pollution
image.

Conclusion: DreamPainter和DreamEcom-400K为电商背景生成提供了高质量解决方案，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Although diffusion-based image genenation has been widely explored and
applied, background generation tasks in e-commerce scenarios still face
significant challenges. The first challenge is to ensure that the generated
products are consistent with the given product inputs while maintaining a
reasonable spatial arrangement, harmonious shadows, and reflections between
foreground products and backgrounds. Existing inpainting methods fail to
address this due to the lack of domain-specific data. The second challenge
involves the limitation of relying solely on text prompts for image control, as
effective integrating visual information to achieve precise control in
inpainting tasks remains underexplored. To address these challenges, we
introduce DreamEcom-400K, a high-quality e-commerce dataset containing accurate
product instance masks, background reference images, text prompts, and
aesthetically pleasing product images. Based on this dataset, we propose
DreamPainter, a novel framework that not only utilizes text prompts for control
but also flexibly incorporates reference image information as an additional
control signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, maintaining high product
consistency while effectively integrating both text prompt and reference image
information.

Conclusion: 统一模型在RGB图像上的类别级姿态估计中表现出色，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recognizing objects in images is a fundamental problem in computer vision.
Although detecting objects in 2D images is common, many applications require
determining their pose in 3D space. Traditional category-level methods rely on
RGB-D inputs, which may not always be available, or employ two-stage approaches
that use separate models and representations for detection and pose estimation.
For the first time, we introduce a unified model that integrates detection and
pose estimation into a single framework for RGB images by leveraging neural
mesh models with learned features and multi-model RANSAC. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results for RGB category-level pose estimation on REAL275,
improving on the current state-of-the-art by 22.9% averaged across all
scale-agnostic metrics. Finally, we demonstrate that our unified method
exhibits greater robustness compared to single-stage baselines. Our code and

Result: 在现有基准和CL3AN数据集上验证了方法的有效性，表现出更强的鲁棒性和较低计算成本。

Conclusion: CL3AN数据集和新框架为复杂光照下的图像恢复提供了有效解决方案，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Illumination in practical scenarios is inherently complex, involving colored
light sources, occlusions, and diverse material interactions that produce
intricate reflectance and shading effects. However, existing methods often
oversimplify this challenge by assuming a single light source or uniform,
white-balanced lighting, leaving many of these complexities unaddressed.In this
paper, we introduce CL3AN, the first large-scale, high-resolution dataset of
its kind designed to facilitate the restoration of images captured under
multiple Colored Light sources to their Ambient-Normalized counterparts.
Through benchmarking, we find that leading approaches often produce artifacts,
such as illumination inconsistencies, texture leakage, and color distortion,
primarily due to their limited ability to precisely disentangle illumination
from reflectance. Motivated by this insight, we achieve such a desired
decomposition through a novel learning framework that leverages explicit
chromaticity and luminance components guidance, drawing inspiration from the
principles of the Retinex model. Extensive evaluations on existing benchmarks
and our dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing
enhanced robustness under non-homogeneous color lighting and material-specific
reflectance variations, all while maintaining a highly competitive
computational cost. The benchmark, codes, and models are available at

TL;DR: GaussianCross提出了一种跨模态自监督3D表示学习架构，通过3D高斯散射技术解决现有方法中的模型崩溃和结构信息缺失问题，并在多个基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督预训练方法因点云区分难度不足导致模型崩溃和结构信息缺失，影响了性能和可靠性。

Method: GaussianCross通过3D高斯散射技术将点云转换为统一的高斯表示，并结合三属性自适应蒸馏散射模块构建3D特征场，以捕捉多模态一致性特征。

Result: 在ScanNet等基准测试中，GaussianCross表现出卓越的参数和数据效率，并在语义和实例分割任务中显著提升性能。

Conclusion: GaussianCross通过跨模态一致性特征学习，显著提升了3D场景理解的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: The significance of informative and robust point representations has been
widely acknowledged for 3D scene understanding. Despite existing
self-supervised pre-training counterparts demonstrating promising performance,
the model collapse and structural information deficiency remain prevalent due
to insufficient point discrimination difficulty, yielding unreliable
expressions and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we present
GaussianCross, a novel cross-modal self-supervised 3D representation learning
architecture integrating feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques
to address current challenges. GaussianCross seamlessly converts
scale-inconsistent 3D point clouds into a unified cuboid-normalized Gaussian
representation without missing details, enabling stable and generalizable
pre-training. Subsequently, a tri-attribute adaptive distillation splatting
module is incorporated to construct a 3D feature field, facilitating synergetic
feature capturing of appearance, geometry, and semantic cues to maintain
cross-modal consistency. To validate GaussianCross, we perform extensive
evaluations on various benchmarks, including ScanNet, ScanNet200, and S3DIS. In
particular, GaussianCross shows a prominent parameter and data efficiency,
achieving superior performance through linear probing (<0.1% parameters) and
limited data training (1% of scenes) compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, GaussianCross demonstrates strong generalization capabilities,
improving the full fine-tuning accuracy by 9.3% mIoU and 6.1% AP$_{50}$ on
ScanNet200 semantic and instance segmentation tasks, respectively, supporting
the effectiveness of our approach. The code, weights, and visualizations are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于HIPAA安全港方法的Python算法，用于DICOM文件中的PII和PHI信息去标识化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DICOM文件中的个人可识别信息（PII）和健康识别信息（PHI）需要根据HIPAA和隐私法规进行去标识化，以符合法律要求。

Method: 研究实现了一种基于HIPAA安全港方法的算法，通过自定义输入参数对DICOM标签进行分类和去标识化。

Result: 算法成功识别并去标识化了敏感信息，如姓名、病史和个人数据。

Conclusion: 开发的Python算法具有灵活性，适用于日常使用和研究，代码已开源。

Abstract: Background : De-identification of DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communi-cations
in Medicine) files is an essential component of medical image research.
Personal Identifiable Information (PII) and/or Personal Health Identifying
Information (PHI) need to be hidden or removed due to legal reasons. According
to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and privacy
rules, also full-face photographic images and any compa-rable images are direct
identifiers and are considered protected health information that also need to
be de-identified. Objective : The study aimed to implement a method that permit
to de-identify the PII and PHI information present in the header and burned on
the pixel data of DICOM. Methods : To execute the de-identification, we
implemented an algorithm based on the safe harbor method, defined by HIPAA. Our
algorithm uses input customizable parameter to classify and then possibly
de-identify individual DICOM tags. Results : The most sensible information,
like names, history, personal data and institution were successfully
recognized. Conclusions : We developed a python algorithm that is able to
classify infor-mation present in a DICOM file. The flexibility provided by the
use of customi-zable input parameters, which allow the user to customize the
entire process de-pending on the case (e.g., the language), makes the entire
program very promis-ing for both everyday use and research purposes. Our code

TL;DR: 提出了一种弱监督多模态时序伪造定位方法（WMMT），通过多任务学习实现视频级标注下的精细检测与时序定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Deepfake视频传播引发的信任危机，填补弱监督多模态时序伪造定位（WS-MTFL）研究的空白。

Method: 采用多任务学习框架，结合视觉和音频模态检测，利用Mixture-of-Experts结构和特征增强模块提升定位精度。

Result: 实验表明，WMMT在弱监督条件下性能接近全监督方法。

Conclusion: WMMT为弱监督多模态时序伪造定位提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The spread of Deepfake videos has caused a trust crisis and impaired social
stability. Although numerous approaches have been proposed to address the
challenges of Deepfake detection and localization, there is still a lack of
systematic research on the weakly supervised multimodal fine-grained temporal
forgery localization (WS-MTFL). In this paper, we propose a novel weakly
supervised multimodal temporal forgery localization via multitask learning
(WMMT), which addresses the WS-MTFL under the multitask learning paradigm. WMMT
achieves multimodal fine-grained Deepfake detection and temporal partial
forgery localization using merely video-level annotations. Specifically, visual
and audio modality detection are formulated as two binary classification tasks.
The multitask learning paradigm is introduced to integrate these tasks into a
multimodal task. Furthermore, WMMT utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts structure to
adaptively select appropriate features and localization head, achieving
excellent flexibility and localization precision in WS-MTFL. A feature
enhancement module with temporal property preserving attention mechanism is
proposed to identify the intra- and inter-modality feature deviation and
construct comprehensive video features. To further explore the temporal
information for weakly supervised learning, an extensible deviation perceiving
loss has been proposed, which aims to enlarge the deviation of adjacent
segments of the forged samples and reduce the deviation of genuine samples.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of multitask learning for
WS-MTFL, and the WMMT achieves comparable results to fully supervised
approaches in several evaluation metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对量化模型的持续零阶适应（ZOA）框架，通过仅需两次前向传播实现高效模型适应，解决了现有测试时适应（TTA）方法在量化模型上的不适用问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化模型在动态环境中因域偏移导致性能显著下降，而现有TTA方法依赖梯度反向传播，无法适用于量化模型。

Method: 提出ZOA框架，仅需两次前向传播实现高效适应，并设计域知识管理方案以减少不同域知识的干扰。

Result: 在量化W6A6 ViT-B模型上，ZOA在ImageNet-C数据集上比现有最优方法提升5.0%。

Conclusion: ZOA框架为量化模型提供了一种高效且鲁棒的适应方法，显著提升了模型在动态环境中的性能。

Abstract: Quantizing deep models prior to deployment is a widely adopted technique to
speed up inference for various real-time applications, such as autonomous
driving. However, quantized models often suffer from severe performance
degradation in dynamic environments with potential domain shifts and this
degradation is significantly more pronounced compared with their full-precision
counterparts, as shown by our theoretical and empirical illustrations. To
address the domain shift problem, test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an
effective solution by enabling models to learn adaptively from test data.
Unfortunately, existing TTA methods are often impractical for quantized models
as they typically rely on gradient backpropagation--an operation that is
unsupported on quantized models due to vanishing gradients, as well as memory
and latency constraints. In this paper, we focus on TTA for quantized models to
improve their robustness and generalization ability efficiently. We propose a
continual zeroth-order adaptation (ZOA) framework that enables efficient model
adaptation using only two forward passes, eliminating the computational burden
of existing methods. Moreover, we propose a domain knowledge management scheme
to store and reuse different domain knowledge with negligible memory
consumption, reducing the interference of different domain knowledge and
fostering the knowledge accumulation during long-term adaptation. Experimental
results on three classical architectures, including quantized transformer-based
and CNN-based models, demonstrate the superiority of our methods for quantized
model adaptation. On the quantized W6A6 ViT-B model, our ZOA is able to achieve
a 5.0\% improvement over the state-of-the-art FOA on ImageNet-C dataset. The

*Yanyun Wang,Li Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文揭示了对抗训练中硬对抗样本的过度学习是导致清洁精度与对抗鲁棒性权衡的原因，提出了一种新的鲁棒感知对抗训练方法（RPAT）来缓解这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为对抗训练中硬对抗样本的不足学习导致决策边界复杂化，从而引发清洁精度与对抗鲁棒性的权衡。本文首次发现，硬对抗样本实际上已被过度学习，导致决策边界退化。

Method: 提出了一种新的对抗训练目标——鲁棒感知（Robust Perception），并基于此设计了鲁棒感知对抗训练方法（RPAT），鼓励模型感知随输入扰动平滑变化。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny-ImageNet数据集上，使用ResNet-18、PreActResNet-18和WideResNet-34-10验证了RPAT的有效性，超越了4种常见基线和12种SOTA方法。

Conclusion: RPAT通过优化模型对扰动的感知平滑性，有效缓解了清洁精度与对抗鲁棒性的权衡问题。

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is one of the most effective methods to train
robust Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, AT creates an inherent trade-off
between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness, which is commonly attributed
to the more complicated decision boundary caused by the insufficient learning
of hard adversarial samples. In this work, we reveal a counterintuitive fact
for the first time: From the perspective of perception consistency, hard
adversarial samples that can still attack the robust model after AT are already
learned better than those successfully defended. Thus, different from previous
views, we argue that it is rather the over-sufficient learning of hard
adversarial samples that degrades the decision boundary and contributes to the
trade-off problem. Specifically, the excessive pursuit of perception
consistency would force the model to view the perturbations as noise and ignore
the information within them, which should have been utilized to induce a
smoother perception transition towards the decision boundary to support its
establishment to an appropriate location. In response, we define a new AT
objective named Robust Perception, encouraging the model perception to change
smoothly with input perturbations, based on which we propose a novel Robust
Perception Adversarial Training (RPAT) method, effectively mitigating the
current accuracy-robustness trade-off. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
Tiny-ImageNet with ResNet-18, PreActResNet-18, and WideResNet-34-10 demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method beyond four common baselines and 12
state-of-the-art (SOTA) works. The code is available at

TL;DR: CAM（内容自适应Mamba）通过动态SSM改进LIC，引入内容感知令牌重组和全局先验，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Mamba模型内容无关，无法动态利用内容依赖关系，限制了性能。

Method: 提出CAM，包括内容感知令牌重组和全局先验集成。

Result: CMIC模型在多个基准测试中表现优于VTM-21.0，BD-rate显著降低。

Conclusion: CAM有效提升了LIC模型的全局依赖捕捉能力，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: Recent Learned image compression (LIC) leverages Mamba-style state-space
models (SSMs) for global receptive fields with linear complexity. However,
vanilla Mamba is content-agnostic, relying on fixed and predefined selective
scans, which restricts its ability to dynamically and fully exploit content
dependencies. We introduce Content-Adaptive Mamba (CAM), a dynamic SSM that
addresses two critical limitations. First, it employs content-aware token
reorganization, clustering and reordering tokens based on content similarity to
prioritize proximity in feature space over Euclidean space. Second, it
integrates global priors into SSM via a prompt dictionary, effectively
mitigating the strict causality and long-range decay in the token interactions
of Mamba. These innovations enable CAM to better capture global dependencies
while preserving computational efficiency. Leveraging CAM, our Content-Adaptive
Mamba-based LIC model (CMIC) achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion
performance, surpassing VTM-21.0 by -15.91\%, -21.34\%, and -17.58\% BD-rate on
Kodak, Tecnick, and CLIC benchmarks, respectively.

TL;DR: COSFormer是一种基于Transformer的持续学习框架，专为多任务WSI分析设计，能够在无需重新训练历史任务的情况下高效学习新任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着WSI在临床中的快速增加，需要一种资源高效且高性能的持续学习系统，以适应新任务而无需重新训练旧任务。

Method: 提出COSFormer框架，采用Transformer结构，支持多任务WSI分析，避免历史数据的重复训练。

Result: 在七个器官和六个任务的WSI数据集上测试，COSFormer表现出优于现有持续学习框架的泛化能力和有效性。

Conclusion: COSFormer是临床应用中持续WSI分析的强有力解决方案。

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis, with its ability to reveal detailed tissue
structures in magnified views, plays a crucial role in cancer diagnosis and
prognosis. Due to their giga-sized nature, WSIs require substantial storage and
computational resources for processing and training predictive models. With the
rapid increase in WSIs used in clinics and hospitals, there is a growing need
for a continual learning system that can efficiently process and adapt existing
models to new tasks without retraining or fine-tuning on previous tasks. Such a
system must balance resource efficiency with high performance. In this study,
we introduce COSFormer, a Transformer-based continual learning framework
tailored for multi-task WSI analysis. COSFormer is designed to learn
sequentially from new tasks wile avoiding the need to revisit full historical
datasets. We evaluate COSFormer on a sequence of seven WSI datasets covering
seven organs and six WSI-related tasks under both class-incremental and
task-incremental settings. The results demonstrate COSFormer's superior
generalizability and effectiveness compared to existing continual learning
frameworks, establishing it as a robust solution for continual WSI analysis in
clinical applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于事件的单积分（ESI）方法，用于实时高帧率强度图像重建，适用于无人机视觉跟踪等场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机具有高动态范围和高时间分辨率等优势，但如何从异步事件流中提取有效信息是实现其潜力的关键。

Method: ESI通过单次积分事件流结合增强衰减算法重建强度图像，实现高帧率（100 FPS）实时处理。

Result: ESI在运行效率、重建质量和帧率上优于现有算法，显著提升无人机在恶劣视觉环境下的感知能力。

Conclusion: ESI方法在极低光照条件下表现出色，适用于无人机机载视觉跟踪等实时应用。

Abstract: Event cameras offer significant advantages, including a wide dynamic range,
high temporal resolution, and immunity to motion blur, making them highly
promising for addressing challenging visual conditions. Extracting and
utilizing effective information from asynchronous event streams is essential
for the onboard implementation of event cameras. In this paper, we propose a
streamlined event-based intensity reconstruction scheme, event-based single
integration (ESI), to address such implementation challenges. This method
guarantees the portability of conventional frame-based vision methods to
event-based scenarios and maintains the intrinsic advantages of event cameras.
The ESI approach reconstructs intensity images by performing a single
integration of the event streams combined with an enhanced decay algorithm.
Such a method enables real-time intensity reconstruction at a high frame rate,
typically 100 FPS. Furthermore, the relatively low computation load of ESI fits
onboard implementation suitably, such as in UAV-based visual tracking
scenarios. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the
performance comparison of ESI and state-of-the-art algorithms. Compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms, ESI demonstrates remarkable runtime efficiency
improvements, superior reconstruction quality, and a high frame rate. As a
result, ESI enhances UAV onboard perception significantly under visual
adversary surroundings. In-flight tests, ESI demonstrates effective performance
for UAV onboard visual tracking under extremely low illumination
conditions(2-10lux), whereas other comparative algorithms fail due to
insufficient frame rate, poor image quality, or limited real-time performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于泰勒展开的动态缓存机制，通过减少缓存特征数量和动态调整预测可靠性，显著提升了扩散变换器（DiTs）的推理速度，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器（DiTs）在视觉生成任务中表现优异，但其推理速度较慢，限制了在低资源应用中的部署。现有方法存在内存和计算开销大、固定缓存调度导致输出质量下降的问题。

Method: 将泰勒预测目标从模块级转移到最后一个块级，减少缓存特征数量；利用第一块的预测误差动态调整缓存机制，仅在预测可靠时使用泰勒预测，否则回退到完整计算。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在FLUX、DiT和Wan Video上分别实现了3.17x、2.36x和4.14x的加速，且生成质量几乎无下降。

Conclusion: 提出的动态缓存机制有效平衡了推理速度与生成质量，为扩散变换器的实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
visual generation tasks. However, their low inference speed limits their
deployment in low-resource applications. Recent training-free approaches
exploit the redundancy of features across timesteps by caching and reusing past
representations to accelerate inference. Building on this idea, TaylorSeer
instead uses cached features to predict future ones via Taylor expansion.
However, its module-level prediction across all transformer blocks (e.g.,
attention or feedforward modules) requires storing fine-grained intermediate
features, leading to notable memory and computation overhead. Moreover, it
adopts a fixed caching schedule without considering the varying accuracy of
predictions across timesteps, which can lead to degraded outputs when
prediction fails. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach to
better leverage Taylor-based acceleration. First, we shift the Taylor
prediction target from the module level to the last block level, significantly
reducing the number of cached features. Furthermore, observing strong
sequential dependencies among Transformer blocks, we propose to use the error
between the Taylor-estimated and actual outputs of the first block as an
indicator of prediction reliability. If the error is small, we trust the Taylor
prediction for the last block; otherwise, we fall back to full computation,
thereby enabling a dynamic caching mechanism. Empirical results show that our
method achieves a better balance between speed and quality, achieving a 3.17x
acceleration on FLUX, 2.36x on DiT, and 4.14x on Wan Video with negligible
quality drop. The Project Page is

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在图像数据冗余和视觉特征一次性提取的问题，影响了效果和准确性。

Method: 提出Intra-和Inter-modal Collaborative Reflections框架，优先利用文本信息，不足时通过多轮迭代整合视觉线索。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上性能优于现有方法，分别提升3.2%、5.1%和1.6%。

Conclusion: I2CR框架有效解决了多模态实体链接中的挑战，显著提升了准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal entity linking plays a crucial role in a wide range of
applications. Recent advances in large language model-based methods have become
the dominant paradigm for this task, effectively leveraging both textual and
visual modalities to enhance performance. Despite their success, these methods
still face two challenges, including unnecessary incorporation of image data in
certain scenarios and the reliance only on a one-time extraction of visual
features, which can undermine their effectiveness and accuracy. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel LLM-based framework for the multimodal
entity linking task, called Intra- and Inter-modal Collaborative Reflections.
This framework prioritizes leveraging text information to address the task.
When text alone is insufficient to link the correct entity through intra- and
inter-modality evaluations, it employs a multi-round iterative strategy that
integrates key visual clues from various aspects of the image to support
reasoning and enhance matching accuracy. Extensive experiments on three widely
used public datasets demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods in the task, achieving improvements of 3.2%,
5.1%, and 1.6%, respectively. Our code is available at

Motivation: 减轻标注负担，提升伪标签的可靠性。

Method: 采用导数标签传播技术，对像素级特征向量施加离散导数操作作为额外正则化。

Result: 实验验证了设计的合理性，并展示了优于其他方法的性能。

Conclusion: DerProp通过严格正则化的相似性度量，有效解决了伪标签的不可靠问题。

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation, which leverages a limited set of
labeled images, helps to relieve the heavy annotation burden. While
pseudo-labeling strategies yield promising results, there is still room for
enhancing the reliability of pseudo-labels. Hence, we develop a semi-supervised
framework, namely DerProp, equipped with a novel derivative label propagation
to rectify imperfect pseudo-labels. Our label propagation method imposes
discrete derivative operations on pixel-wise feature vectors as additional
regularization, thereby generating strictly regularized similarity metrics.
Doing so effectively alleviates the ill-posed problem that identical
similarities correspond to different features, through constraining the
solution space. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the rationality
of our design, and demonstrate our superiority over other methods. Codes are
available at https://github.com/ForawardStar/DerProp/.

Motivation: 病理学中的VLM因超高分辨率、复杂组织结构和临床语义的细微差异容易产生幻觉，影响临床信任。现有RAG方法主要依赖文本知识库，无法充分利用视觉线索。

Method: 提出Patho-AgenticRAG，基于权威病理学教材的页面级嵌入构建数据库，支持联合文本-图像检索，并具备推理、任务分解和多轮搜索功能。

Result: 实验表明，Patho-AgenticRAG在复杂病理任务（如多选题诊断和视觉问答）中显著优于现有多模态模型。

Conclusion: Patho-AgenticRAG通过多模态检索和推理能力，有效解决了病理学VLM的幻觉问题，提升了诊断准确性。

Abstract: Although Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong generalization in
medical imaging, pathology presents unique challenges due to ultra-high
resolution, complex tissue structures, and nuanced clinical semantics. These
factors make pathology VLMs prone to hallucinations, i.e., generating outputs
inconsistent with visual evidence, which undermines clinical trust. Existing
RAG approaches in this domain largely depend on text-based knowledge bases,
limiting their ability to leverage diagnostic visual cues. To address this, we
propose Patho-AgenticRAG, a multimodal RAG framework with a database built on
page-level embeddings from authoritative pathology textbooks. Unlike
traditional text-only retrieval systems, it supports joint text-image search,
enabling direct retrieval of textbook pages that contain both the queried text
and relevant visual cues, thus avoiding the loss of critical image-based
information. Patho-AgenticRAG also supports reasoning, task decomposition, and
multi-turn search interactions, improving accuracy in complex diagnostic
scenarios. Experiments show that Patho-AgenticRAG significantly outperforms
existing multimodal models in complex pathology tasks like multiple-choice
diagnosis and visual question answering. Our project is available at the

Motivation: 解决现有基于3D高斯基元的对象中心方法中随机初始化导致的效率低下和异常基元引入错误的问题。

Conclusion: SplatSSC通过深度引导和噪声抑制，实现了高效且高精度的3D语义场景补全。

Abstract: Monocular 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is a challenging yet promising
task that aims to infer dense geometric and semantic descriptions of a scene
from a single image. While recent object-centric paradigms significantly
improve efficiency by leveraging flexible 3D Gaussian primitives, they still
rely heavily on a large number of randomly initialized primitives, which
inevitably leads to 1) inefficient primitive initialization and 2) outlier
primitives that introduce erroneous artifacts. In this paper, we propose
SplatSSC, a novel framework that resolves these limitations with a depth-guided
initialization strategy and a principled Gaussian aggregator. Instead of random
initialization, SplatSSC utilizes a dedicated depth branch composed of a
Group-wise Multi-scale Fusion (GMF) module, which integrates multi-scale image
and depth features to generate a sparse yet representative set of initial
Gaussian primitives. To mitigate noise from outlier primitives, we develop the
Decoupled Gaussian Aggregator (DGA), which enhances robustness by decomposing
geometric and semantic predictions during the Gaussian-to-voxel splatting
process. Complemented with a specialized Probability Scale Loss, our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Occ-ScanNet dataset, outperforming
prior approaches by over 6.3% in IoU and 4.1% in mIoU, while reducing both
latency and memory consumption by more than 9.3%. The code will be released
upon acceptance.

Motivation: 解决半监督对比学习中伪标签选择过度自信导致的性能下降问题，以及分类和分割任务间信息共享不足的问题。

Method: 结合对比学习和半监督学习，引入双阈值伪标签选择策略，开发了任务间注意力和显著性模块，设计了任务间一致性学习策略。

Result: 在两个公共超声数据集和一个私有数据集上，Hermes在多种半监督设置下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Hermes通过改进伪标签选择和任务间信息共享，显著提升了半监督对比学习在超声图像分类和分割中的性能。

Abstract: Confidence-based pseudo-label selection usually generates overly confident
yet incorrect predictions, due to the early misleadingness of model and
overfitting inaccurate pseudo-labels in the learning process, which heavily
degrades the performance of semi-supervised contrastive learning. Moreover,
segmentation and classification tasks are treated independently and the
affinity fails to be fully explored. To address these issues, we propose a
novel semi-supervised dual-threshold contrastive learning strategy for
ultrasound image classification and segmentation, named Hermes. This strategy
combines the strengths of contrastive learning with semi-supervised learning,
where the pseudo-labels assist contrastive learning by providing additional
guidance. Specifically, an inter-task attention and saliency module is also
developed to facilitate information sharing between the segmentation and
classification tasks. Furthermore, an inter-task consistency learning strategy
is designed to align tumor features across both tasks, avoiding negative
transfer for reducing features discrepancy. To solve the lack of publicly
available ultrasound datasets, we have collected the SZ-TUS dataset, a thyroid
ultrasound image dataset. Extensive experiments on two public ultrasound
datasets and one private dataset demonstrate that Hermes consistently
outperforms several state-of-the-art methods across various semi-supervised
settings.

*Xiangzeng Liu,Chi Wang,Guanglu Shi,Xiaodong Zhang,Qiguang Miao,Miao Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SGAD提出了一种新的语义和几何感知描述符网络，通过直接匹配高区分度的区域描述符，显著提升了匹配的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于A2PM框架的方法依赖低效的像素级比较和复杂图匹配，限制了可扩展性。

Method: SGAD生成高区分度的区域描述符，避免复杂图优化；采用分类和排序子任务监督策略；引入HCRF消除重叠区域。

Result: SGAD将运行时间减少60倍（0.82s vs. 60.23s），在室内外姿态估计中均表现出色。

Conclusion: SGAD通过创新方法显著提升了区域匹配的性能和效率，成为新的SOTA。

Abstract: Local feature matching remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision.
Recent Area to Point Matching (A2PM) methods have improved matching accuracy.
However, existing research based on this framework relies on inefficient
pixel-level comparisons and complex graph matching that limit scalability. In
this work, we introduce the Semantic and Geometric-aware Descriptor Network
(SGAD), which fundamentally rethinks area-based matching by generating highly
discriminative area descriptors that enable direct matching without complex
graph optimization. This approach significantly improves both accuracy and
efficiency of area matching. We further improve the performance of area
matching through a novel supervision strategy that decomposes the area matching
task into classification and ranking subtasks. Finally, we introduce the
Hierarchical Containment Redundancy Filter (HCRF) to eliminate overlapping
areas by analyzing containment graphs. SGAD demonstrates remarkable performance
gains, reducing runtime by 60x (0.82s vs. 60.23s) compared to MESA. Extensive
evaluations show consistent improvements across multiple point matchers:
SGAD+LoFTR reduces runtime compared to DKM, while achieving higher accuracy
(0.82s vs. 1.51s, 65.98 vs. 61.11) in outdoor pose estimation, and SGAD+ROMA
delivers +7.39% AUC@5{\deg} in indoor pose estimation, establishing a new
state-of-the-art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割对疾病诊断至关重要，但现有方法在跨模态性能上存在不足，尤其是边缘信息在预训练中的作用未被系统研究。

Method: 通过两种预训练方式（原始数据和边缘增强数据）训练基础模型，并引入元学习策略基于图像统计特征选择最优模型。

Result: 边缘增强预训练在某些模态上表现更好，而在其他模态上表现较差；元学习策略显著提升了整体性能（16.42%-19.30%）。

Conclusion: 边缘增强预训练需选择性应用，元学习策略能有效优化模型选择，提升跨模态分割性能。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for disease diagnosis and treatment
planning, yet developing robust segmentation models often requires substantial
computational resources and large datasets. Existing research shows that
pre-trained and finetuned foundation models can boost segmentation performance.
However, questions remain about how particular image preprocessing steps may
influence segmentation performance across different medical imaging modalities.
In particular, edges-abrupt transitions in pixel intensity-are widely
acknowledged as vital cues for object boundaries but have not been
systematically examined in the pre-training of foundation models. We address
this gap by investigating to which extend pre-training with data processed
using computationally efficient edge kernels, such as kirsch, can improve
cross-modality segmentation capabilities of a foundation model. Two versions of
a foundation model are first trained on either raw or edge-enhanced data across
multiple medical imaging modalities, then finetuned on selected raw subsets
tailored to specific medical modalities. After systematic investigation using
the medical domains Dermoscopy, Fundus, Mammography, Microscopy, OCT, US, and
XRay, we discover both increased and reduced segmentation performance across
modalities using edge-focused pre-training, indicating the need for a selective
application of this approach. To guide such selective applications, we propose
a meta-learning strategy. It uses standard deviation and image entropy of the
raw image to choose between a model pre-trained on edge-enhanced or on raw data
for optimal performance. Our experiments show that integrating this
meta-learning layer yields an overall segmentation performance improvement
across diverse medical imaging tasks by 16.42% compared to models pre-trained
on edge-enhanced data only and 19.30% compared to models pre-trained on raw
data only.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统传感器（如LiDAR和RGB相机）在高动态场景中存在感知间隙，而现有的事件相机与常规传感器融合方法在快速运动场景中表现不佳。

Method: 提出了一种仅使用事件相机的立体3D目标检测框架，引入双滤波器机制提取语义和几何信息，并通过目标中心信息对齐边界框以增强回归。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在动态环境中优于现有方法，验证了事件相机在连续时间3D感知中的潜力。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了仅依赖事件相机实现鲁棒3D目标检测的可行性，为高动态场景提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: 3D object detection is essential for autonomous systems, enabling precise
localization and dimension estimation. While LiDAR and RGB cameras are widely
used, their fixed frame rates create perception gaps in high-speed scenarios.
Event cameras, with their asynchronous nature and high temporal resolution,
offer a solution by capturing motion continuously. The recent approach, which
integrates event cameras with conventional sensors for continuous-time
detection, struggles in fast-motion scenarios due to its dependency on
synchronized sensors. We propose a novel stereo 3D object detection framework
that relies solely on event cameras, eliminating the need for conventional 3D
sensors. To compensate for the lack of semantic and geometric information in
event data, we introduce a dual filter mechanism that extracts both.
Additionally, we enhance regression by aligning bounding boxes with
object-centric information. Experiments show that our method outperforms prior
approaches in dynamic environments, demonstrating the potential of event
cameras for robust, continuous-time 3D perception. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoMet是一种新的训练策略，用于深度异常检测模型，能够从未经筛选的数据中学习，无需手动过滤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无监督异常检测需要手动筛选数据，引入偏差且适应性差。CoMet旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合Soft Confident Learning（低置信度样本权重降低）和Meta-Learning（基于验证损失协方差正则化更新），防止过拟合并增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个数据集上优于基线方法，对训练集中的异常不敏感，并达到新的最优性能。

Conclusion: CoMet是一种模型无关的方法，适用于任何基于梯度下降的异常检测模型，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: So-called unsupervised anomaly detection is better described as
semi-supervised, as it assumes all training data are nominal. This assumption
simplifies training but requires manual data curation, introducing bias and
limiting adaptability. We propose Confident Meta-learning (CoMet), a novel
training strategy that enables deep anomaly detection models to learn from
uncurated datasets where nominal and anomalous samples coexist, eliminating the
need for explicit filtering. Our approach integrates Soft Confident Learning,
which assigns lower weights to low-confidence samples, and Meta-Learning, which
stabilizes training by regularizing updates based on training validation loss
covariance. This prevents overfitting and enhances robustness to noisy data.
CoMet is model-agnostic and can be applied to any anomaly detection method
trainable via gradient descent. Experiments on MVTec-AD, VIADUCT, and KSDD2
with two state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
consistently improving over the baseline methods, remaining insensitive to
anomalies in the training set, and setting a new state-of-the-art across all
datasets.

Abstract: Reliable preclinical disease risk assessment is essential to move public
healthcare from reactive treatment to proactive identification and prevention.
However, image-based risk prediction algorithms often consider one condition at
a time and depend on hand-crafted features obtained through segmentation tools.
We propose a whole-body self-supervised representation learning method for the
preclinical disease risk assessment under a competing risk modeling. This
approach outperforms whole-body radiomics in multiple diseases, including
cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Simulating a
preclinical screening scenario and subsequently combining with cardiac MRI, it
sharpens further the prediction for CVD subgroups: ischemic heart disease
(IHD), hypertensive diseases (HD), and stroke. The results indicate the
translational potential of whole-body representations as a standalone screening
modality and as part of a multi-modal framework within clinical workflows for
early personalized risk stratification. The code is available at

TL;DR: AI在医疗中需人机协作以确保安全，研究发现基于不确定性量化的延迟策略比学习延迟模型更稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI在医疗决策中如何安全地延迟决策，特别是在数据分布变化时。

Method: 比较学习延迟模型和不确定性量化方法在眼科数据集上的表现，评估其分类和延迟能力。

Result: 不确定性量化方法在分布内外数据上表现更稳健，适合作为AI延迟策略。

Conclusion: 不确定性量化方法可能是AI延迟决策的更好选择。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds the potential to dramatically improve
patient care. However, it is not infallible, necessitating
human-AI-collaboration to ensure safe implementation. One aspect of AI safety
is the models' ability to defer decisions to a human expert when they are
likely to misclassify autonomously. Recent research has focused on methods that
learn to defer by optimising a surrogate loss function that finds the optimal
trade-off between predicting a class label or deferring. However, during
clinical translation, models often face challenges such as data shift.
Uncertainty quantification methods aim to estimate a model's confidence in its
predictions. However, they may also be used as a deferral strategy which does
not rely on learning from specific training distribution. We hypothesise that
models developed to quantify uncertainty are more robust to out-of-distribution
(OOD) input than learned deferral models that have been trained in a supervised
fashion. To investigate this hypothesis, we constructed an extensive evaluation
study on a large ophthalmology dataset, examining both learned deferral models
and established uncertainty quantification methods, assessing their performance
in- and out-of-distribution. Specifically, we evaluate their ability to
accurately classify glaucoma from fundus images while deferring cases with a
high likelihood of error. We find that uncertainty quantification methods may
be a promising choice for AI deferral.

Conclusion: 逻辑驱动的约束有效提升了零样本组合动作识别的性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot compositional action recognition (ZS-CAR) aims to identify unseen
verb-object compositions in the videos by exploiting the learned knowledge of
verb and object primitives during training. Despite compositional learning's
progress in ZS-CAR, two critical challenges persist: 1) Missing compositional
structure constraint, leading to spurious correlations between primitives; 2)
Neglecting semantic hierarchy constraint, leading to semantic ambiguity and
impairing the training process. In this paper, we argue that human-like
symbolic reasoning offers a principled solution to these challenges by
explicitly modeling compositional and hierarchical structured abstraction. To
this end, we propose a logic-driven ZS-CAR framework LogicCAR that integrates
dual symbolic constraints: Explicit Compositional Logic and Hierarchical
Primitive Logic. Specifically, the former models the restrictions within the
compositions, enhancing the compositional reasoning ability of our model. The
latter investigates the semantical dependencies among different primitives,
empowering the models with fine-to-coarse reasoning capacity. By formalizing
these constraints in first-order logic and embedding them into neural network
architectures, LogicCAR systematically bridges the gap between symbolic
abstraction and existing models. Extensive experiments on the Sth-com dataset
demonstrate that our LogicCAR outperforms existing baseline methods, proving
the effectiveness of our logic-driven constraints.

advantages, for example regarding dynamic scenes.

Motivation: 解决复杂文本渲染和图像编辑一致性的挑战。

Method: 采用渐进式训练策略（从非文本到文本渲染）和多任务训练范式（包括T2I、TI2I和I2I任务），并引入双编码机制。

Result: 在英语和中文等语言中表现优异，图像生成和编辑能力达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: Qwen-Image在复杂文本渲染和图像编辑方面具有强大能力，适用于多语言和多任务场景。

Abstract: We present Qwen-Image, an image generation foundation model in the Qwen
series that achieves significant advances in complex text rendering and precise
image editing. To address the challenges of complex text rendering, we design a
comprehensive data pipeline that includes large-scale data collection,
filtering, annotation, synthesis, and balancing. Moreover, we adopt a
progressive training strategy that starts with non-text-to-text rendering,
evolves from simple to complex textual inputs, and gradually scales up to
paragraph-level descriptions. This curriculum learning approach substantially
enhances the model's native text rendering capabilities. As a result,
Qwen-Image not only performs exceptionally well in alphabetic languages such as
English, but also achieves remarkable progress on more challenging logographic
languages like Chinese. To enhance image editing consistency, we introduce an
improved multi-task training paradigm that incorporates not only traditional
text-to-image (T2I) and text-image-to-image (TI2I) tasks but also
image-to-image (I2I) reconstruction, effectively aligning the latent
representations between Qwen2.5-VL and MMDiT. Furthermore, we separately feed
the original image into Qwen2.5-VL and the VAE encoder to obtain semantic and
reconstructive representations, respectively. This dual-encoding mechanism
enables the editing module to strike a balance between preserving semantic
consistency and maintaining visual fidelity. Qwen-Image achieves
state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its strong capabilities in both
image generation and editing across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Despite the success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP in aligning
vision and language, their proficiency in detailed, fine-grained visual
comprehension remains a key challenge. We present CLIP-IN, a novel framework
that bolsters CLIP's fine-grained perception through two core innovations.
Firstly, we leverage instruction-editing datasets, originally designed for
image manipulation, as a unique source of hard negative image-text pairs.
Coupled with a symmetric hard negative contrastive loss, this enables the model
to effectively distinguish subtle visual-semantic differences. Secondly,
CLIP-IN incorporates long descriptive captions, utilizing rotary positional
encodings to capture rich semantic context often missed by standard CLIP. Our
experiments demonstrate that CLIP-IN achieves substantial gains on the MMVP
benchmark and various fine-grained visual recognition tasks, without
compromising robust zero-shot performance on broader classification and
retrieval tasks. Critically, integrating CLIP-IN's visual representations into
Multimodal Large Language Models significantly reduces visual hallucinations
and enhances reasoning abilities. This work underscores the considerable
potential of synergizing targeted, instruction-based contrastive learning with
comprehensive descriptive information to elevate the fine-grained understanding
of VLMs.

Conclusion: 新算法在球面模式旋转估计中表现出高效性和鲁棒性，并成功应用于点云配准和球面图像旋转估计任务。

Abstract: Existing methods for rotation estimation between two spherical
($\mathbb{S}^2$) patterns typically rely on spherical cross-correlation
maximization between two spherical function. However, these approaches exhibit
computational complexities greater than cubic $O(n^3)$ with respect to rotation
space discretization and lack extensive evaluation under significant outlier
contamination. To this end, we propose a rotation estimation algorithm between
two spherical patterns with linear time complexity $O(n)$. Unlike existing
spherical-function-based methods, we explicitly represent spherical patterns as
discrete 3D point sets on the unit sphere, reformulating rotation estimation as
a spherical point-set alignment (i.e., Wahba problem for 3D unit vectors).
Given the geometric nature of our formulation, our spherical pattern alignment
algorithm naturally aligns with the Wahba problem framework for 3D unit
vectors. Specifically, we introduce three novel algorithms: (1) SPMC (Spherical
Pattern Matching by Correlation), (2) FRS (Fast Rotation Search), and (3) a
hybrid approach (SPMC+FRS) that combines the advantages of the previous two
methods. Our experiments demonstrate that in the $\mathbb{S}^2$ domain and in
correspondence-free settings, our algorithms are over 10x faster and over 10x
more accurate than current state-of-the-art methods for the Wahba problem with
outliers. We validate our approach through extensive simulations on a new
dataset of spherical patterns, the ``Robust Vector Alignment Dataset.
"Furthermore, we adapt our methods to two real-world tasks: (i) Point Cloud
Registration (PCR) and (ii) rotation estimation for spherical images.

Conclusion: LPD通过多样化的共同空间和解相关损失，显著提升了视频搜索的全面性和多样性。

Abstract: Ad-hoc Video Search (AVS) involves using a textual query to search for
multiple relevant videos in a large collection of unlabeled short videos. The
main challenge of AVS is the visual diversity of relevant videos. A simple
query such as "Find shots of a man and a woman dancing together indoors" can
span a multitude of environments, from brightly lit halls and shadowy bars to
dance scenes in black-and-white animations. It is therefore essential to
retrieve relevant videos as comprehensively as possible. Current solutions for
the AVS task primarily fuse multiple features into one or more common spaces,
yet overlook the need for diverse spaces. To fully exploit the expressive
capability of individual features, we propose LPD, short for Learning Partially
Decorrelated common spaces. LPD incorporates two key innovations:
feature-specific common space construction and the de-correlation loss.
Specifically, LPD learns a separate common space for each video and text
feature, and employs de-correlation loss to diversify the ordering of negative
samples across different spaces. To enhance the consistency of multi-space
convergence, we designed an entropy-based fair multi-space triplet ranking
loss. Extensive experiments on the TRECVID AVS benchmarks (2016-2023) justify
the effectiveness of LPD. Moreover, diversity visualizations of LPD's spaces
highlight its ability to enhance result diversity.

Abstract: Pedestrians Localization in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) regions within urban
environments poses a significant challenge for autonomous driving systems.
While mmWave radar has demonstrated potential for detecting objects in such
scenarios, the 2D radar point cloud (PCD) data is susceptible to distortions
caused by multipath reflections, making accurate spatial inference difficult.
Additionally, although camera images provide high-resolution visual
information, they lack depth perception and cannot directly observe objects in
NLoS regions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that interprets radar
PCD through road layout inferred from camera for localization of NLoS
pedestrians. The proposed method leverages visual information from the camera
to interpret 2D radar PCD, enabling spatial scene reconstruction. The
effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through experiments
conducted using a radar-camera system mounted on a real vehicle. The
localization performance is evaluated using a dataset collected in outdoor NLoS
driving environments, demonstrating the practical applicability of the method.

Conclusion: Text2Lip为可控且灵活的说话人脸生成提供了新范式。

Abstract: Generating semantically coherent and visually accurate talking faces requires
bridging the gap between linguistic meaning and facial articulation. Although
audio-driven methods remain prevalent, their reliance on high-quality paired
audio visual data and the inherent ambiguity in mapping acoustics to lip motion
pose significant challenges in terms of scalability and robustness. To address
these issues, we propose Text2Lip, a viseme-centric framework that constructs
an interpretable phonetic-visual bridge by embedding textual input into
structured viseme sequences. These mid-level units serve as a linguistically
grounded prior for lip motion prediction. Furthermore, we design a progressive
viseme-audio replacement strategy based on curriculum learning, enabling the
model to gradually transition from real audio to pseudo-audio reconstructed
from enhanced viseme features via cross-modal attention. This allows for robust
generation in both audio-present and audio-free scenarios. Finally, a
landmark-guided renderer synthesizes photorealistic facial videos with accurate
lip synchronization. Extensive evaluations show that Text2Lip outperforms
existing approaches in semantic fidelity, visual realism, and modality
robustness, establishing a new paradigm for controllable and flexible talking
face generation. Our project homepage is https://plyon1.github.io/Text2Lip/.

Result: 在多项任务中表现优异，如LPIPS 0.001、SSIM 0.992，重建损失提升7.8%-12.9%，身份保留提升11.2%。

Abstract: Effective image inversion in rectified flow models - mapping real images to
editable latent representations - is crucial for practical image editing
applications; however, achieving optimal balance between reconstruction
fidelity and editing flexibility remains a fundamental challenge. In this work,
we introduce the Optimal Transport Inversion Pipeline (OTIP), a zero-shot
framework that leverages optimal transport theory to guide the inversion
process in rectified flow models. Our underlying hypothesis is that
incorporating transport-based guidance during the reverse diffusion process can
effectively balance reconstruction accuracy and editing controllability through
principled trajectory optimization. The method computes optimal transport paths
between image and noise distributions while maintaining computational
efficiency. Our approach achieves high-fidelity reconstruction with LPIPS
scores of 0.001 and SSIM of 0.992 on face editing benchmarks, demonstrating
superior preservation of fine-grained details compared to existing methods. We
evaluate the framework across multiple editing tasks, observing 7.8% to 12.9%
improvements in reconstruction loss over RF-Inversion on the LSUN-Bedroom and
LSUN-Church datasets, respectively. For semantic face editing, our method
achieves an 11.2% improvement in identity preservation and a 1.6% enhancement
in perceptual quality, while maintaining computational efficiency comparable to
baseline approaches. Qualitatively, our method produces visually compelling
edits with superior semantic consistency and fine-grained detail preservation
across diverse editing scenarios. Code is available at:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 港口物流中运输单元的识别效率低，缺乏公开的多样化数据集阻碍了研究进展。

Method: 提出TRUDI数据集（35,034个标注实例）和TITUS流水线（三阶段：分割、ID文本定位、识别与验证）。

Result: TITUS在多样化视角和环境下可靠识别TUs，优于依赖特定场景的系统。

Conclusion: TRUDI数据集和TITUS流水线为港口数字化转型和物流效率提升提供了支持。

Abstract: Identifying transportation units (TUs) is essential for improving the
efficiency of port logistics. However, progress in this field has been hindered
by the lack of publicly available benchmark datasets that capture the diversity
and dynamics of real-world port environments. To address this gap, we present
the TRUDI dataset-a comprehensive collection comprising 35,034 annotated
instances across five categories: container, tank container, trailer, ID text,
and logo. The images were captured at operational ports using both ground-based
and aerial cameras, under a wide variety of lighting and weather conditions.
For the identification of TUs-which involves reading the 11-digit alphanumeric
ID typically painted on each unit-we introduce TITUS, a dedicated pipeline that
operates in three stages: (1) segmenting the TU instances, (2) detecting the
location of the ID text, and (3) recognising and validating the extracted ID.
Unlike alternative systems, which often require similar scenes, specific camera
angles or gate setups, our evaluation demonstrates that TITUS reliably
identifies TUs from a range of camera perspectives and in varying lighting and
weather conditions. By making the TRUDI dataset publicly available, we provide
a robust benchmark that enables the development and comparison of new
approaches. This contribution supports digital transformation efforts in
multipurpose ports and helps to increase the efficiency of entire logistics
chains.

Conclusion: Uni-Layout通过统一生成和评估框架，解决了布局生成中的任务特定性和评估问题，效果显著。

Abstract: Layout generation plays a crucial role in enhancing both user experience and
design efficiency. However, current approaches suffer from task-specific
generation capabilities and perceptually misaligned evaluation metrics, leading
to limited applicability and ineffective measurement. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Uni-Layout}, a novel framework that achieves unified generation,
human-mimicking evaluation and alignment between the two. For universal
generation, we incorporate various layout tasks into a single taxonomy and
develop a unified generator that handles background or element contents
constrained tasks via natural language prompts. To introduce human feedback for
the effective evaluation of layouts, we build \textit{Layout-HF100k}, the first
large-scale human feedback dataset with 100,000 expertly annotated layouts.
Based on \textit{Layout-HF100k}, we introduce a human-mimicking evaluator that
integrates visual and geometric information, employing a Chain-of-Thought
mechanism to conduct qualitative assessments alongside a confidence estimation
module to yield quantitative measurements. For better alignment between the
generator and the evaluator, we integrate them into a cohesive system by
adopting Dynamic-Margin Preference Optimization (DMPO), which dynamically
adjusts margins based on preference strength to better align with human
judgments. Extensive experiments show that \textit{Uni-Layout} significantly
outperforms both task-specific and general-purpose methods. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/JD-GenX/Uni-Layout.

Conclusion: SMART-Ship数据集能支持多模态遥感任务，并为未来研究提供方向。

Abstract: Given the limitations of satellite orbits and imaging conditions, multi-modal
remote sensing (RS) data is crucial in enabling long-term earth observation.
However, maritime surveillance remains challenging due to the complexity of
multi-scale targets and the dynamic environments. To bridge this critical gap,
we propose a Synchronized Multi-modal Aligned Remote sensing Targets dataset
for berthed ships analysis (SMART-Ship), containing spatiotemporal registered
images with fine-grained annotation for maritime targets from five modalities:
visible-light, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), panchromatic, multi-spectral,
and near-infrared. Specifically, our dataset consists of 1092 multi-modal image
sets, covering 38,838 ships. Each image set is acquired within one week and
registered to ensure spatiotemporal consistency. Ship instances in each set are
annotated with polygonal location information, fine-grained categories,
instance-level identifiers, and change region masks, organized hierarchically
to support diverse multi-modal RS tasks. Furthermore, we define standardized
benchmarks on five fundamental tasks and comprehensively compare representative
methods across the dataset. Thorough experiment evaluations validate that the
proposed SMART-Ship dataset could support various multi-modal RS interpretation
tasks and reveal the promising directions for further exploration.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动无监督对象定位领域的发展，提供一种简单高效的方法。

Method: 使用CutOnce一次性生成多对象伪标签，结合自训练提升性能。

Result: 在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: COLER是一种零样本无监督模型，具有潜力推动无监督对象定位的进步。

Abstract: We propose Cut-Once-and-LEaRn (COLER), a simple approach for unsupervised
instance segmentation and object detection. COLER first uses our developed
CutOnce to generate coarse pseudo labels, then enables the detector to learn
from these masks. CutOnce applies Normalized Cut only once and does not rely on
any clustering methods, but it can generate multiple object masks in an image.
We have designed several novel yet simple modules that not only allow CutOnce
to fully leverage the object discovery capabilities of self-supervised models,
but also free it from reliance on mask post-processing. During training, COLER
achieves strong performance without requiring specially designed loss functions
for pseudo labels, and its performance is further improved through
self-training. COLER is a zero-shot unsupervised model that outperforms
previous state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks.We believe our method
can help advance the field of unsupervised object localization.

TL;DR: Hydra结合毫米波雷达与摄像头技术，通过检测叶片上的水分来测量叶片湿润持续时间（LWD），准确率高达96%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LWD检测方法缺乏标准化，且在不同植物特性和环境条件下效果不佳，Hydra旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 设计CNN融合毫米波深度图像与RGB图像，利用Transformer编码器生成特征图，并通过分类器检测叶片湿润状态。

Result: Hydra在多种环境下准确率达96%，在恶劣条件下仍保持约90%的准确率。

Conclusion: Hydra为LWD检测提供了一种高精度且鲁棒的方法，适用于实际农业场景。

Abstract: Leaf Wetness Duration (LWD), the time that water remains on leaf surfaces, is
crucial in the development of plant diseases. Existing LWD detection lacks
standardized measurement techniques, and variations across different plant
characteristics limit its effectiveness. Prior research proposes diverse
approaches, but they fail to measure real natural leaves directly and lack
resilience in various environmental conditions. This reduces the precision and
robustness, revealing a notable practical application and effectiveness gap in
real-world agricultural settings. This paper presents Hydra, an innovative
approach that integrates millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) radar with camera technology
to detect leaf wetness by determining if there is water on the leaf. We can
measure the time to determine the LWD based on this detection. Firstly, we
design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to selectively fuse multiple
mm-Wave depth images with an RGB image to generate multiple feature images.
Then, we develop a transformer-based encoder to capture the inherent connection
among the multiple feature images to generate a feature map, which is further
fed to a classifier for detection. Moreover, we augment the dataset during
training to generalize our model. Implemented using a frequency-modulated
continuous-wave (FMCW) radar within the 76 to 81 GHz band, Hydra's performance
is meticulously evaluated on plants, demonstrating the potential to classify
leaf wetness with up to 96% accuracy across varying scenarios. Deploying Hydra
in the farm, including rainy, dawn, or poorly light nights, it still achieves
an accuracy rate of around 90%.

Motivation: 多变量时间序列分析因高维性、动态性和变量间复杂交互而具有挑战性，超图的结构建模能力为此提供了灵感。

Method: 通过多头部自注意力增强时间表示，构建分层超图以聚合通道内时间模式和变量间细粒度关系，并通过EdgeToNode模块和前馈网络进一步优化特征。

Result: 在两项多变量时间序列任务和八个数据集上的实验验证了HGTS-Former的有效性。

Conclusion: HGTS-Former在多变量时间序列分析中表现出色，代码将开源。

Abstract: Multivariate time series analysis has long been one of the key research
topics in the field of artificial intelligence. However, analyzing complex time
series data remains a challenging and unresolved problem due to its high
dimensionality, dynamic nature, and complex interactions among variables.
Inspired by the strong structural modeling capability of hypergraphs, this
paper proposes a novel hypergraph-based time series transformer backbone
network, termed HGTS-Former, to address the multivariate coupling in time
series data. Specifically, given the multivariate time series signal, we first
normalize and embed each patch into tokens. Then, we adopt the multi-head
self-attention to enhance the temporal representation of each patch. The
hierarchical hypergraphs are constructed to aggregate the temporal patterns
within each channel and fine-grained relations between different variables.
After that, we convert the hyperedge into node features through the EdgeToNode
module and adopt the feed-forward network to further enhance the output
features. Extensive experiments conducted on two multivariate time series tasks
and eight datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed
HGTS-Former. The source code will be released on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胶质母细胞瘤是一种高度侵袭性的脑肿瘤，生存期预测对个性化治疗和临床决策至关重要。传统方法依赖肿瘤分割，流程复杂且计算资源密集。

Method: 利用Vision Transformers（ViTs）直接从MRI图像提取特征，避免肿瘤分割步骤。模型在BRATS数据集上评估。

Result: 测试集准确率达62.5%，在精确率、召回率和F1分数上表现均衡，优于其他方法。但ViT因数据集较小，泛化能力受限。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了ViTs在医学影像任务中的潜力，为无需分割的高效OS预测模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Glioblastoma is one of the most aggressive and common brain tumors, with a
median survival of 10-15 months. Predicting Overall Survival (OS) is critical
for personalizing treatment strategies and aligning clinical decisions with
patient outcomes. In this study, we propose a novel Artificial Intelligence
(AI) approach for OS prediction using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images,
exploiting Vision Transformers (ViTs) to extract hidden features directly from
MRI images, eliminating the need of tumor segmentation. Unlike traditional
approaches, our method simplifies the workflow and reduces computational
resource requirements.
  The proposed model was evaluated on the BRATS dataset, reaching an accuracy
of 62.5% on the test set, comparable to the top-performing methods.
Additionally, it demonstrated balanced performance across precision, recall,
and F1 score, overcoming the best model in these metrics. The dataset size
limits the generalization of the ViT which typically requires larger datasets
compared to convolutional neural networks. This limitation in generalization is
observed across all the cited studies. This work highlights the applicability
of ViTs for downsampled medical imaging tasks and establishes a foundation for
OS prediction models that are computationally efficient and do not rely on
segmentation.

Conclusion: InfoSyncNet通过创新的非均匀序列建模和数据增强技术，显著提升了视觉语音识别的性能。

Abstract: Estimating spoken content from silent videos is crucial for applications in
Assistive Technology (AT) and Augmented Reality (AR). However, accurately
mapping lip movement sequences in videos to words poses significant challenges
due to variability across sequences and the uneven distribution of information
within each sequence. To tackle this, we introduce InfoSyncNet, a non-uniform
sequence modeling network enhanced by tailored data augmentation techniques.
Central to InfoSyncNet is a non-uniform quantization module positioned between
the encoder and decoder, enabling dynamic adjustment to the network's focus and
effectively handling the natural inconsistencies in visual speech data.
Additionally, multiple training strategies are incorporated to enhance the
model's capability to handle variations in lighting and the speaker's
orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the LRW and LRW1000 datasets confirm
the superiority of InfoSyncNet, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracies of
92.0% and 60.7% Top-1 ACC. The code is available for download (see comments).

TL;DR: SAMPO通过偏好优化改进SAM模型，使其能从稀疏视觉提示中推断用户意图，显著提升密集同质对象的分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SAM模型仅能分割显式提示对象而无法泛化到语义相关实例的问题，尤其在密集同质对象（如生物医学核分割）领域。

Method: 提出SAMPO框架，通过偏好优化让模型隐式捕捉目标类别特征，无需依赖语言模型。

Result: 在三个医学分割任务中表现优异，仅用10%训练数据即超越所有基线方法，PanNuke-T2任务提升9个百分点。

Conclusion: SAMPO为视觉基础模型引入意图感知对齐新范式，摆脱了对辅助提示生成器或语言模型的依赖。

Abstract: Foundation models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) excel in promptable
segmentation but suffer from an intent gap: they segment only explicitly
prompted objects, failing to generalize to semantically related instances
implicitly desired by users. This limitation is critical in domains with dense
homogeneous objects (e.g., biomedical nuclei segmentation), where sparse visual
prompts typically yield incomplete results, rendering dense annotations
impractical due to prohibitive cost. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAMPO
(Segment Anything Model with Preference Optimization), a novel framework that
teaches visual foundation models to infer high-level categorical intent from
sparse visual interactions. Unlike conventional pixel-level fine-tuning, SAMPO
optimizes models to implicitly capture target-class characteristics through
preference optimization. This approach, which operates without dependency on
language models, enables robust multi-object segmentation even under sparse
prompting and demonstrates superior data efficiency during fine-tuning.
Validated on three medical segmentation tasks, SAMPO achieves state-of-the-art
performance: on challenging tasks like PanNuke-T2, our method, when fine-tuned
with only 10% of the training data, significantly outperforms all existing
methods trained on the full 100% dataset, achieving an improvement of over 9
percentage points compared to the best baseline. Our work establishes a new
paradigm for intent-aware alignment in visual foundation models, removing
dependencies on auxiliary prompt generators or language-model-assisted
preference learning.

Motivation: 现有方法在多类图像异常检测中性能不足，且类别信息的使用方式对检测阈值定义的影响未被充分研究。

Method: 提出Hierarchical Coreset (HierCore)框架，利用分层记忆库估计类别的异常检测决策标准，无需类别标签也能有效工作。

Result: 实验表明，HierCore在所有四种场景下均满足要求，性能稳定且优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HierCore在多类图像异常检测中具有实际应用潜力，能适应不同标签可用性的场景。

Abstract: Recent advances in image anomaly detection have extended unsupervised
learning-based models from single-class settings to multi-class frameworks,
aiming to improve efficiency in training time and model storage. When a single
model is trained to handle multiple classes, it often underperforms compared to
class-specific models in terms of per-class detection accuracy. Accordingly,
previous studies have primarily focused on narrowing this performance gap.
However, the way class information is used, or not used, remains a relatively
understudied factor that could influence how detection thresholds are defined
in multi-class image anomaly detection. These thresholds, whether
class-specific or class-agnostic, significantly affect detection outcomes. In
this study, we identify and formalize the requirements that a multi-class image
anomaly detection model must satisfy under different conditions, depending on
whether class labels are available during training and evaluation. We then
re-examine existing methods under these criteria. To meet these challenges, we
propose Hierarchical Coreset (HierCore), a novel framework designed to satisfy
all defined requirements. HierCore operates effectively even without class
labels, leveraging a hierarchical memory bank to estimate class-wise decision
criteria for anomaly detection. We empirically validate the applicability and
robustness of existing methods and HierCore under four distinct scenarios,
determined by the presence or absence of class labels in the training and
evaluation phases. The experimental results demonstrate that HierCore
consistently meets all requirements and maintains strong, stable performance
across all settings, highlighting its practical potential for real-world
multi-class anomaly detection tasks.

Conclusion: FMS通过多重监督机制有效提升了DGM$^4$任务的检测性能。

Abstract: The task of Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation (DGM$^4$)
is a branch of misinformation detection. Unlike traditional binary
classification, it includes complex subtasks such as forgery content
localization and forgery method classification. Consider that existing methods
are often limited in performance due to neglecting the erroneous interference
caused by unreliable unimodal data and failing to establish comprehensive
forgery supervision for mining fine-grained tampering traces. In this paper, we
present a Fine-grained Multiple Supervisory (FMS) network, which incorporates
modality reliability supervision, unimodal internal supervision and cross-modal
supervision to provide comprehensive guidance for DGM$^4$ detection. For
modality reliability supervision, we propose the Multimodal Decision Supervised
Correction (MDSC) module. It leverages unimodal weak supervision to correct the
multi-modal decision-making process. For unimodal internal supervision, we
propose the Unimodal Forgery Mining Reinforcement (UFMR) module. It amplifies
the disparity between real and fake information within unimodal modality from
both feature-level and sample-level perspectives. For cross-modal supervision,
we propose the Multimodal Forgery Alignment Reasoning (MFAR) module. It
utilizes soft-attention interactions to achieve cross-modal feature perception
from both consistency and inconsistency perspectives, where we also design the
interaction constraints to ensure the interaction quality. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FMS compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该研究为多镜头fMRI重建确立了新范式，通过明确分解和语义提示实现了复杂视觉叙事的准确恢复。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic videos from fMRI is important for understanding visual
cognition and enabling vivid brain-computer interfaces. However, current
methods are critically limited to single-shot clips, failing to address the
multi-shot nature of real-world experiences. Multi-shot reconstruction faces
fundamental challenges: fMRI signal mixing across shots, the temporal
resolution mismatch between fMRI and video obscuring rapid scene changes, and
the lack of dedicated multi-shot fMRI-video datasets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel divide-and-decode framework for multi-shot fMRI
video reconstruction. Our core innovations are: (1) A shot boundary predictor
module explicitly decomposing mixed fMRI signals into shot-specific segments.
(2) Generative keyframe captioning using LLMs, which decodes robust textual
descriptions from each segment, overcoming temporal blur by leveraging
high-level semantics. (3) Novel large-scale data synthesis (20k samples) from
existing datasets. Experimental results demonstrate our framework outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in multi-shot reconstruction fidelity. Ablation
studies confirm the critical role of fMRI decomposition and semantic
captioning, with decomposition significantly improving decoded caption CLIP
similarity by 71.8%. This work establishes a new paradigm for multi-shot fMRI
reconstruction, enabling accurate recovery of complex visual narratives through
explicit decomposition and semantic prompting.

Method: 提出EFA-GS方法，选择性扩展未优化的高斯分布以优先学习低频信息，并结合深度和尺度策略动态优化。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，EFA-GS显著减少伪影，PSNR提升1.68 dB，同时保留高频细节。

Conclusion: EFA-GS有效减少浮动物体伪影，适用于3D编辑任务，代码将开源。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a powerful and computationally efficient
representation for 3D reconstruction. Despite its strengths, 3DGS often
produces floating artifacts, which are erroneous structures detached from the
actual geometry and significantly degrade visual fidelity. The underlying
mechanisms causing these artifacts, particularly in low-quality initialization
scenarios, have not been fully explored. In this paper, we investigate the
origins of floating artifacts from a frequency-domain perspective and identify
under-optimized Gaussians as the primary source. Based on our analysis, we
propose \textit{Eliminating-Floating-Artifacts} Gaussian Splatting (EFA-GS),
which selectively expands under-optimized Gaussians to prioritize accurate
low-frequency learning. Additionally, we introduce complementary depth-based
and scale-based strategies to dynamically refine Gaussian expansion,
effectively mitigating detail erosion. Extensive experiments on both synthetic
and real-world datasets demonstrate that EFA-GS substantially reduces floating
artifacts while preserving high-frequency details, achieving an improvement of
1.68 dB in PSNR over baseline method on our RWLQ dataset. Furthermore, we
validate the effectiveness of our approach in downstream 3D editing tasks. Our
implementation will be released on GitHub.

Abstract: Due to the optical properties, transparent objects often lead depth cameras
to generate incomplete or invalid depth data, which in turn reduces the
accuracy and reliability of robotic grasping. Existing approaches typically
input the RGB-D image directly into the network to output the complete depth,
expecting the model to implicitly infer the reliability of depth values.
However, while effective in training datasets, such methods often fail to
generalize to real-world scenarios, where complex light interactions lead to
highly variable distributions of valid and invalid depth data. To address this,
we propose ReMake, a novel depth completion framework guided by an instance
mask and monocular depth estimation. By explicitly distinguishing transparent
regions from non-transparent ones, the mask enables the model to concentrate on
learning accurate depth estimation in these areas from RGB-D input during
training. This targeted supervision reduces reliance on implicit reasoning and
improves generalization to real-world scenarios. Additionally, monocular depth
estimation provides depth context between the transparent object and its
surroundings, enhancing depth prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments show
that our method outperforms existing approaches on both benchmark datasets and
real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior accuracy and generalization
capability. Code and videos are available at

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用大型多模态模型（LMMs）预测短视频用户参与度的有效性，比较了两种模型（VideoLLaMA2和Qwen2.5-VL）的性能，并展示了音频特征的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着短视频平台上用户生成内容（UGC）的快速增长，预测用户参与度对优化推荐系统和内容创作至关重要，但现有方法难以有效建模多模态特征的交互。

Method: 采用两种LMMs（VideoLLaMA2和Qwen2.5-VL），分别整合音频、视觉和语言模态或仅视觉和语言模态，并在SnapUGC数据集上进行训练。

Result: 两种模型均表现出色，VideoLLaMA2因包含音频特征表现更优，集成方法在ICCV VQualA 2025挑战赛中夺冠。

Conclusion: LMMs在用户参与度预测中具有潜力，音频特征的加入显著提升性能。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of user-generated content (UGC) on short-form video
platforms has made video engagement prediction increasingly important for
optimizing recommendation systems and guiding content creation. However, this
task remains challenging due to the complex interplay of factors such as
semantic content, visual quality, audio characteristics, and user background.
Prior studies have leveraged various types of features from different
modalities, such as visual quality, semantic content, background sound, etc.,
but often struggle to effectively model their cross-feature and cross-modality
interactions. In this work, we empirically investigate the potential of large
multimodal models (LMMs) for video engagement prediction. We adopt two
representative LMMs: VideoLLaMA2, which integrates audio, visual, and language
modalities, and Qwen2.5-VL, which models only visual and language modalities.
Specifically, VideoLLaMA2 jointly processes key video frames, text-based
metadata, and background sound, while Qwen2.5-VL utilizes only key video frames
and text-based metadata. Trained on the SnapUGC dataset, both models
demonstrate competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines,
showcasing the effectiveness of LMMs in engagement prediction. Notably,
VideoLLaMA2 consistently outperforms Qwen2.5-VL, highlighting the importance of
audio features in engagement prediction. By ensembling two types of models, our
method achieves first place in the ICCV VQualA 2025 EVQA-SnapUGC Challenge on
short-form video engagement prediction. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 艺术斑马线虽提升行人安全，但其视觉复杂性可能干扰依赖视觉的监控系统，需研究其影响。

Method: 通过合成不同艺术图案到固定监控场景，评估模型在正常和恶意设计斑马线下的行人检测表现。

Result: 复杂艺术图案显著降低检测性能，恶意设计可故意遮挡行人或生成虚假检测。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了城市视觉监控系统的潜在漏洞，强调设计鲁棒行人感知模型时需考虑环境视觉变化。

Abstract: Artistic crosswalks featuring asphalt art, introduced by different
organizations in recent years, aim to enhance the visibility and safety of
pedestrians. However, their visual complexity may interfere with surveillance
systems that rely on vision-based object detection models. In this study, we
investigate the impact of asphalt art on pedestrian detection performance of a
pretrained vision-based object detection model. We construct realistic
crosswalk scenarios by compositing various street art patterns into a fixed
surveillance scene and evaluate the model's performance in detecting
pedestrians on asphalt-arted crosswalks under both benign and adversarial
conditions. A benign case refers to pedestrian crosswalks painted with existing
normal asphalt art, whereas an adversarial case involves digitally crafted or
altered asphalt art perpetrated by an attacker. Our results show that while
simple, color-based designs have minimal effect, complex artistic patterns,
particularly those with high visual salience, can significantly degrade
pedestrian detection performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
adversarially crafted asphalt art can be exploited to deliberately obscure real
pedestrians or generate non-existent pedestrian detections. These findings
highlight a potential vulnerability in urban vision-based pedestrian
surveillance systems and underscore the importance of accounting for
environmental visual variations when designing robust pedestrian perception
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAVC框架动态调整视频压缩级别，根据天气和光照条件优化带宽使用，同时保持车辆检测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决智能交通系统中因带宽限制导致的实时性能问题，同时减少视频质量损失对车辆检测精度的影响。

Method: 使用PAVC框架，动态调整视频压缩级别以适应环境变化，并结合车辆检测算法。

Result: PAVC在中等带宽下提升检测精度13%，减少带宽需求8.23倍；在极低带宽下减少需求72倍。

Conclusion: PAVC有效平衡带宽使用与检测精度，适用于不同带宽环境。

Abstract: Computer vision has become a popular tool in intelligent transportation
systems (ITS), enabling various applications through roadside traffic cameras
that capture video and transmit it in real time to computing devices within the
same network. The efficiency of this video transmission largely depends on the
available bandwidth of the communication system. However, limited bandwidth can
lead to communication bottlenecks, hindering the real-time performance of ITS
applications. To mitigate this issue, lossy video compression techniques can be
used to reduce bandwidth requirements, at the cost of degrading video quality.
This degradation can negatively impact the accuracy of applications that rely
on real-time vehicle detection. Additionally, vehicle detection accuracy is
influenced by environmental factors such as weather and lighting conditions,
suggesting that compression levels should be dynamically adjusted in response
to these variations. In this work, we utilize a framework called
Precision-Aware Video Compression (PAVC), where a roadside video camera
captures footage of vehicles on roadways, compresses videos, and then transmits
them to a processing unit, running a vehicle detection algorithm for
safety-critical applications, such as real-time collision risk assessment. The
system dynamically adjusts the video compression level based on current weather
and lighting conditions to maintain vehicle detection accuracy while minimizing
bandwidth usage. Our results demonstrate that PAVC improves vehicle detection
accuracy by up to 13% and reduces communication bandwidth requirements by up to
8.23x in areas with moderate bandwidth availability. Moreover, in locations
with severely limited bandwidth, PAVC reduces bandwidth requirements by up to
72x while preserving vehicle detection performance.

TL;DR: MonoDream是一个轻量级的视觉语言动作（VLA）框架，通过统一导航表示（UNR）和潜在全景梦境（LPD）任务，提升单目视觉导航性能，缩小与全景RGB-D方法的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单目视觉导航性能落后于全景RGB-D方法的问题，同时降低传感器成本。

Method: 提出MonoDream框架，学习UNR表示，并通过LPD任务监督模型预测全景RGB和深度特征。

Result: 在多个VLN基准测试中，MonoDream显著提升单目导航性能，缩小与全景方法的差距。

Conclusion: MonoDream通过UNR和LPD任务，有效提升了单目视觉导航的可靠性和性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks often leverage panoramic RGB and depth
inputs to provide rich spatial cues for action planning, but these sensors can
be costly or less accessible in real-world deployments. Recent approaches based
on Vision-Language Action (VLA) models achieve strong results with monocular
input, yet they still lag behind methods using panoramic RGB-D information. We
present MonoDream, a lightweight VLA framework that enables monocular agents to
learn a Unified Navigation Representation (UNR). This shared feature
representation jointly aligns navigation-relevant visual semantics (e.g.,
global layout, depth, and future cues) and language-grounded action intent,
enabling more reliable action prediction. MonoDream further introduces Latent
Panoramic Dreaming (LPD) tasks to supervise the UNR, which train the model to
predict latent features of panoramic RGB and depth observations at both current
and future steps based on only monocular input. Experiments on multiple VLN
benchmarks show that MonoDream consistently improves monocular navigation
performance and significantly narrows the gap with panoramic-based agents.

Motivation: 当前文本到动作生成方法存在多样性不足、错误累积和物理不合理性等问题，ReMoMask旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: ReMoMask结合了双向动量文本-动作模型、语义时空注意力机制和RAG-无分类器引导，优化了跨模态检索和动作生成。

Conclusion: ReMoMask通过创新设计显著提升了文本到动作生成的性能，成为当前最优方法。

Abstract: Text-to-Motion (T2M) generation aims to synthesize realistic and semantically
aligned human motion sequences from natural language descriptions. However,
current approaches face dual challenges: Generative models (e.g., diffusion
models) suffer from limited diversity, error accumulation, and physical
implausibility, while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods exhibit
diffusion inertia, partial-mode collapse, and asynchronous artifacts. To
address these limitations, we propose ReMoMask, a unified framework integrating
three key innovations: 1) A Bidirectional Momentum Text-Motion Model decouples
negative sample scale from batch size via momentum queues, substantially
improving cross-modal retrieval precision; 2) A Semantic Spatio-temporal
Attention mechanism enforces biomechanical constraints during part-level fusion
to eliminate asynchronous artifacts; 3) RAG-Classier-Free Guidance incorporates
minor unconditional generation to enhance generalization. Built upon MoMask's
RVQ-VAE, ReMoMask efficiently generates temporally coherent motions in minimal
steps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the
state-of-the-art performance of ReMoMask, achieving a 3.88% and 10.97%
improvement in FID scores on HumanML3D and KIT-ML, respectively, compared to
the previous SOTA method RAG-T2M. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在VQA评估中依赖点估计，忽略了性能方差的影响，可能导致评估不准确。

Method: 分析了14个VQA基准测试中的方差，研究了训练种子、框架非确定性、模型规模和指令微调对性能的影响，并探索了Cloze式评估策略。

Result: 研究发现当前评估方法存在局限性，性能方差显著影响结果。

Conclusion: 建议采用方差感知方法，以促进MLLMs的更稳健发展。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
visual question answering (VQA), enabling reasoning and contextual
understanding across visual and textual modalities. Despite their advancements,
the evaluation of MLLMs on VQA benchmarks often relies on point estimates,
overlooking the significant variance in performance caused by factors such as
stochastic model outputs, training seed sensitivity, and hyperparameter
configurations. This paper critically examines these issues by analyzing
variance across 14 widely used VQA benchmarks, covering diverse tasks such as
visual reasoning, text understanding, and commonsense reasoning. We
systematically study the impact of training seed, framework non-determinism,
model scale, and extended instruction finetuning on performance variability.
Additionally, we explore Cloze-style evaluation as an alternate assessment
strategy, studying its effectiveness in reducing stochasticity and improving
reliability across benchmarks. Our findings highlight the limitations of
current evaluation practices and advocate for variance-aware methodologies to
foster more robust and reliable development of MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法局限于短时小规模变形且缺乏物理一致性考虑，无法满足复杂刚体运动建模需求。

Method: 1) 目标建模：通过动态场景分解和改进点密度控制实现对象集中重建；2) 运动恢复：通过逐帧SE(3)位姿学习恢复完整运动序列，引入加速度一致性约束和动态模拟退火策略。

Result: 实验表明PMGS在高速非线性刚体运动重建中优于主流动态方法。

Conclusion: PMGS通过物理约束和自适应优化策略，显著提升了复杂刚体运动的建模能力。

Abstract: Modeling complex rigid motion across large spatiotemporal spans remains an
unresolved challenge in dynamic reconstruction. Existing paradigms are mainly
confined to short-term, small-scale deformation and offer limited consideration
for physical consistency. This study proposes PMGS, focusing on reconstructing
Projectile Motion via 3D Gaussian Splatting. The workflow comprises two stages:
1) Target Modeling: achieving object-centralized reconstruction through dynamic
scene decomposition and an improved point density control; 2) Motion Recovery:
restoring full motion sequences by learning per-frame SE(3) poses. We introduce
an acceleration consistency constraint to bridge Newtonian mechanics and pose
estimation, and design a dynamic simulated annealing strategy that adaptively
schedules learning rates based on motion states. Futhermore, we devise a Kalman
fusion scheme to optimize error accumulation from multi-source observations to
mitigate disturbances. Experiments show PMGS's superior performance in
reconstructing high-speed nonlinear rigid motion compared to mainstream dynamic
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏开放、可复现的医疗推理模型构建方法，阻碍了社区研究和比较。

Method: 提出MedVLThinker，包括数据筛选（文本和多模态）和两种训练范式（SFT和RLVR）。

Result: RLVR显著优于SFT，纯文本数据训练效果更好，7B模型在公开VQA基准上达到SOTA。

Conclusion: MedVLThinker为医疗多模态推理研究提供了开放基础，32B模型性能接近GPT-4o。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have introduced a new paradigm in AI by
enabling models to ``think before responding" via chain-of-thought reasoning.
However, the absence of open and reproducible recipes for building
reasoning-centric medical LMMs hinders community-wide research, analysis, and
comparison. In this paper, we present MedVLThinker, a suite of simple yet
strong baselines. Our fully open recipe consists of: (1) systematic data
curation for both text-only and image-text medical data, filtered according to
varying levels of reasoning difficulty, and (2) two training paradigms:
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on distilled reasoning traces and Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) based on final answer correctness.
Across extensive experiments on the Qwen2.5-VL model family (3B, 7B) and six
medical QA benchmarks, we find that RLVR consistently and significantly
outperforms SFT. Additionally, under the RLVR framework, a key,
counter-intuitive finding is that training on our curated text-only reasoning
data provides a more substantial performance boost than training on multimodal
image-text data. Our best open 7B model, trained using the RLVR recipe on
text-only data, establishes a new state-of-the-art on existing public VQA
benchmarks, surpassing all previous open-source medical LMMs. Furthermore,
scaling our model to 32B achieves performance on par with the proprietary
GPT-4o. We release all curated data, models, and code to provide the community
with a strong, open foundation for future research in multimodal medical
reasoning.

Conclusion: AugPT为提示调优提供了一种高效且自包含的解决方案。

Abstract: For CLIP-based prompt tuning, introducing more data as additional knowledge
for enhancing fine-tuning process is proved to be an effective approach.
Existing data amplification strategies for prompt tuning typically rely on
external knowledge (e.g., large language models or pre-structured knowledge
bases), resulting in higher costs for data collection and processing, while
generally ignoring further utilization of features in image modality. To
address this, we propose Augmentation-driven Prompt Tuning (AugPT), a
self-contained distillation-based prompt tuning approach using only internal
augmentation on raw dataset to better exploit known features. Specifically,
AugPT employs self-supervised augmentation on unlabeled images in the training
set, and introduces a novel gating mechanism based on consensus test, reusing
the pre-trained prompt tuning backbone model to spontaneously filter noisy
samples, further enhancing the quality of augmented views. Extensive
experiments validate that AugPT simultaneously enhances model performance and
generalization capability without using appended external knowledge. The code
of AugPT is available at: https://github.com/JREion/AugPT .

Abstract: In document classification, graph-based models effectively capture document
structure, overcoming sequence length limitations and enhancing contextual
understanding. However, most existing graph document representations rely on
heuristics, domain-specific rules, or expert knowledge. Unlike previous
approaches, we propose a method to learn data-driven graph structures,
eliminating the need for manual design and reducing domain dependence. Our
approach constructs homogeneous weighted graphs with sentences as nodes, while
edges are learned via a self-attention model that identifies dependencies
between sentence pairs. A statistical filtering strategy aims to retain only
strongly correlated sentences, improving graph quality while reducing the graph
size. Experiments on three document classification datasets demonstrate that
learned graphs consistently outperform heuristic-based graphs, achieving higher
accuracy and $F_1$ score. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the effectiveness
of the statistical filtering in improving classification robustness. These
results highlight the potential of automatic graph generation over traditional
heuristic approaches and open new directions for broader applications in NLP.

Conclusion: 3D范式和FECT数据集为解决LLMs在联系中心对话分析中的事实性问题提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to hallucinate, producing natural
language outputs that are not grounded in the input, reference materials, or
real-world knowledge. In enterprise applications where AI features support
business decisions, such hallucinations can be particularly detrimental. LLMs
that analyze and summarize contact center conversations introduce a unique set
of challenges for factuality evaluation, because ground-truth labels often do
not exist for analytical interpretations about sentiments captured in the
conversation and root causes of the business problems. To remedy this, we first
introduce a \textbf{3D} -- \textbf{Decompose, Decouple, Detach} -- paradigm in
the human annotation guideline and the LLM-judges' prompt to ground the
factuality labels in linguistically-informed evaluation criteria. We then
introduce \textbf{FECT}, a novel benchmark dataset for \textbf{F}actuality
\textbf{E}valuation of Interpretive AI-Generated \textbf{C}laims in Contact
Center Conversation \textbf{T}ranscripts, labeled under our 3D paradigm.
Lastly, we report our findings from aligning LLM-judges on the 3D paradigm.
Overall, our findings contribute a new approach for automatically evaluating

Abstract: Experts in machine learning leverage domain knowledge to navigate decisions

is particularly critical for fine-tuning language models (LMs), where repeated
trials incur substantial computational overhead and environmental impact.
However, no existing automated framework simultaneously tackles the entire
model selection and HPO task for resource-efficient LM fine-tuning. We
introduce XAutoLM, a meta-learning-augmented AutoML framework that reuses past
experiences to optimise discriminative and generative LM fine-tuning pipelines
efficiently. XAutoLM learns from stored successes and failures by extracting
task- and system-level meta-features to bias its sampling toward fruitful
configurations and away from costly dead ends. On four text classification and
two question-answering benchmarks, XAutoLM surpasses zero-shot optimiser's peak
F1 on five of six tasks, cuts mean evaluation time by up to 4.5x, reduces error
ratios by up to sevenfold, and uncovers up to 50% more pipelines above the
zero-shot Pareto front. In contrast, simpler memory-based baselines suffer
negative transfer. We release XAutoLM and our experience store to catalyse
resource-efficient, Green AI fine-tuning in the NLP community.

Conclusion: MAO-ARAG通过自适应规划工作流，有效平衡了QA系统的性能和成本效率。

Abstract: In question-answering (QA) systems, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has
become pivotal in enhancing response accuracy and reducing hallucination
issues. The architecture of RAG systems varies significantly, encompassing
single-round RAG, iterative RAG, and reasoning RAG, each tailored to address
different types of queries. Due to the varying complexity of real-world
queries, a fixed RAG pipeline often struggles to balance performance and cost
efficiency across different queries. To address this challenge, we propose an
adaptive RAG framework called MAO-ARAG, which leverages multi-agent
orchestration. Our adaptive RAG is conceived as a multi-turn framework.
Specifically, we define multiple executor agents, representing typical RAG
modules such as query reformulation agents, document selection agent, and
generation agents. A planner agent intelligently selects and integrates the
appropriate agents from these executors into a suitable workflow tailored for
each query, striving for high-quality answers while maintaining reasonable
costs. During each turn, the planner agent is trained using reinforcement
learning, guided by an outcome-based reward (F1 score) and a cost-based
penalty, continuously improving answer quality while keeping costs within a
reasonable range. Experiments conducted on multiple QA datasets demonstrate
that our approach, which dynamically plans workflows for each query, not only
achieves high answer quality but also maintains both cost and latency within
acceptable limits.The code of MAO-ARAG is on

Motivation: 评估多语言大模型在低资源语言（如乌尔都语）中的语法知识，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 构建UrBLiMP数据集（5,696对最小差异句子），针对十种核心语法现象，并通过人工评估验证其可靠性。

Result: LLaMA-3-70B表现最佳（94.73%准确率），但与其他顶级模型（如Gemma-3-27B-PT）无显著差异。

Conclusion: 当前多语言大模型在低资源语言的细粒度语法知识捕捉上既有潜力也有局限。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance
across various languages; however, they often include significantly less data
for low-resource languages such as Urdu compared to high-resource languages
like English. To assess the linguistic knowledge of LLMs in Urdu, we present
the Urdu Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal Pairs (UrBLiMP) i.e. pairs of
minimally different sentences that contrast in grammatical acceptability.
UrBLiMP comprises 5,696 minimal pairs targeting ten core syntactic phenomena,
carefully curated using the Urdu Treebank and diverse Urdu text corpora. A
human evaluation of UrBLiMP annotations yielded a 96.10% inter-annotator
agreement, confirming the reliability of the dataset. We evaluate twenty
multilingual LLMs on UrBLiMP, revealing significant variation in performance
across linguistic phenomena. While LLaMA-3-70B achieves the highest average
accuracy (94.73%), its performance is statistically comparable to other top
models such as Gemma-3-27B-PT. These findings highlight both the potential and
the limitations of current multilingual LLMs in capturing fine-grained
syntactic knowledge in low-resource languages.

TL;DR: Pinterest提出了一种高效、低成本的结构化数据提取系统，通过结合网页的结构、视觉和文本信息，使用简单模型（如XGBoost）实现比复杂模型（如GPT）更高的准确性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互联网中存在大量非结构化信息，将其转化为结构化数据具有挑战性。Pinterest需要从电商网站中准确提取结构化产品数据，以提升用户体验和内容分发效率。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的网页表示方法，将结构、视觉和文本模态结合为紧凑形式，适用于小型模型学习。该方法捕捉每个可见HTML节点的文本、样式和布局信息。

Result: 系统实现了高准确性和可扩展性，每秒可处理超过1000个URL，成本比最便宜的GPT替代方案低1000倍。

Conclusion: 通过优化网页表示和简单模型，Pinterest的系统在结构化数据提取任务中表现出色，兼具高效性和成本效益。

Abstract: The internet offers a massive repository of unstructured information, but
it's a significant challenge to convert this into a structured format. At
Pinterest, the ability to accurately extract structured product data from
e-commerce websites is essential to enhance user experiences and improve
content distribution. In this paper, we present Pinterest's system for
attribute extraction, which achieves remarkable accuracy and scalability at a
manageable cost. Our approach leverages a novel webpage representation that
combines structural, visual, and text modalities into a compact form,
optimizing it for small model learning. This representation captures each
visible HTML node with its text, style and layout information. We show how this
allows simple models such as eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to extract
attributes more accurately than much more complex Large Language Models (LLMs)
such as Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT). Our results demonstrate a
system that is highly scalable, processing over 1,000 URLs per second, while
being 1000 times more cost-effective than the cheapest GPT alternatives.

TL;DR: 研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）生成结构化临床咨询模板的能力，发现模型在全面性上表现良好，但模板过长且无法在长度限制下正确优先处理临床重要问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在电子咨询中生成结构化临床模板的潜力，以提升临床信息交换效率。

Method: 使用145个专家制作的模板，通过多代理流程（包括提示优化、语义自动评分和优先级分析）评估多个前沿模型。

Result: 模型如o3在全面性上表现优异（达92.2%），但模板过长且优先级处理不足，性能因专科领域而异。

Conclusion: LLMs可提升临床信息交换，但需更稳健的评估方法以捕捉其在真实场景中的优先级处理能力。

Abstract: This study evaluates the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to generate
structured clinical consultation templates for electronic consultation. Using
145 expert-crafted templates developed and routinely used by Stanford's
eConsult team, we assess frontier models -- including o3, GPT-4o, Kimi K2,
Claude 4 Sonnet, Llama 3 70B, and Gemini 2.5 Pro -- for their ability to
produce clinically coherent, concise, and prioritized clinical question
schemas. Through a multi-agent pipeline combining prompt optimization, semantic
autograding, and prioritization analysis, we show that while models like o3
achieve high comprehensiveness (up to 92.2\%), they consistently generate
excessively long templates and fail to correctly prioritize the most clinically
important questions under length constraints. Performance varies across
specialties, with significant degradation in narrative-driven fields such as
psychiatry and pain medicine. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can enhance
structured clinical information exchange between physicians, while highlighting
the need for more robust evaluation methods that capture a model's ability to
prioritize clinically salient information within the time constraints of
real-world physician communication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于情感表达的文化和语言差异，跨语言情感检测具有挑战性。Semeval 2025 Task 11旨在探索跨语言情感识别的方法。

Method: 采用预训练的多语言LLM，并使用LoRA设置针对每种语言分别进行微调。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在跨语言情感识别任务中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 通过针对每种语言单独微调多语言LLM，可以有效提升跨语言情感识别的性能。

Abstract: Detecting emotions across different languages is challenging due to the
varied and culturally nuanced ways of emotional expressions. The
\textit{Semeval 2025 Task 11: Bridging the Gap in Text-Based emotion} shared
task was organised to investigate emotion recognition across different
languages. The goal of the task is to implement an emotion recogniser that can
identify the basic emotional states that general third-party observers would
attribute to an author based on their written text snippet, along with the
intensity of those emotions. We report our investigation of various
task-adaptation strategies for LLMs in emotion recognition. We show that the
most effective method for this task is to fine-tune a pre-trained multilingual
LLM with LoRA setting separately for each language.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AdaCoRe的任务，旨在通过轻量级策略（如Suffix Optimization）防止LLMs生成受限内容，而无需微调模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLMs的输出空间广泛，内容限制需求因用户群体和时间变化而异，传统方法如监督微调（SFT）不切实际。

Method: 提出Suffix Optimization (SOP)方法，通过在提示后附加优化的后缀来限制LLMs生成特定受限内容。

Result: SOP在CoReBench基准测试中表现优于基线方法，平均限制率提升6%-17%，并在实际平台POE上验证了其实用性。

Conclusion: SOP是一种高效且实用的轻量级方法，适用于动态内容限制需求。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant success across
diverse applications. However, enforcing content restrictions remains a
significant challenge due to their expansive output space. One aspect of
content restriction is preventing LLMs from generating harmful content via
model alignment approaches such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Yet, the need
for content restriction may vary significantly across user groups, change
rapidly over time, and not always align with general definitions of
harmfulness. Applying SFT to each of these specific use cases is impractical
due to the high computational, data, and storage demands. Motivated by this
need, we propose a new task called \textit{Adaptive Content Restriction}
(AdaCoRe), which focuses on lightweight strategies -- methods without model
fine-tuning -- to prevent deployed LLMs from generating restricted terms for
specific use cases. We propose the first method for AdaCoRe, named
\textit{Suffix Optimization (SOP)}, which appends a short, optimized suffix to
any prompt to a) prevent a target LLM from generating a set of restricted
terms, while b) preserving the output quality. To evaluate AdaCoRe approaches,
including our SOP, we create a new \textit{Content Restriction Benchmark}
(CoReBench), which contains 400 prompts for 80 restricted terms across 8
carefully selected categories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SOP on
CoReBench, which outperforms the system-level baselines such as system suffix
by 15\%, 17\%, 10\%, 9\%, and 6\% on average restriction rates for Gemma2-2B,
Mistral-7B, Vicuna-7B, Llama3-8B, and Llama3.1-8B, respectively. We also
demonstrate that SOP is effective on POE, an online platform hosting various
commercial LLMs, highlighting its practicality in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新任务，将聊天查询分割为请求内容、角色、查询特定上下文和附加表达，并分析了用户行为模式及其随时间的变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 聊天日志提供了关于LLM用户的丰富信息，但用户行为模式常被查询的变异性掩盖。研究旨在揭示用户请求行为的特点及其与人类互动的差异。

Method: 提出分割聊天查询的任务，分析请求内容、角色、上下文和附加表达，并进行历时性分析。

Result: 发现用户早期查询强调请求，随着经验积累趋于收敛；模型能力影响用户行为，新模型引入时尤为明显。

Conclusion: 研究提供了对LLM用户行为的新视角，揭示了查询模式的变化和模型对用户行为的影响。

Abstract: Chat logs provide a rich source of information about LLM users, but patterns
of user behavior are often masked by the variability of queries. We present a
new task, segmenting chat queries into contents of requests, roles,
query-specific context, and additional expressions. We find that, despite the
familiarity of chat-based interaction, request-making in LLM queries remains
significantly different from comparable human-human interactions. With the data
resource, we introduce an important perspective of diachronic analyses with
user expressions. We find that query patterns vary between early ones
emphasizing requests, and individual users explore patterns but tend to
converge with experience. Finally, we show that model capabilities affect user
behavior, particularly with the introduction of new models, which are traceable
at the community level.

TL;DR: WebDS是首个端到端的基于网络的数据科学基准测试，包含870个任务，覆盖29个多样化的网站，旨在评估复杂、多步骤的数据科学操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网络基准测试过于简单，传统数据科学基准测试则局限于静态数据集，无法反映现实中的数据科学工作流程。

Method: 引入WebDS基准测试，涵盖从数据获取到分析的全流程，挑战代理完成复杂任务。

Result: 当前SOTA LLM代理在WebDS上表现不佳，仅完成15%的任务，暴露出信息基础薄弱、重复行为和走捷径等问题。

Conclusion: WebDS为开发实用的基于LLM的数据科学工具提供了更真实的测试环境。

Abstract: A large portion of real-world data science tasks are complex and require
multi-hop web-based interactions: finding appropriate data available on the
internet, synthesizing real-time data of various modalities from different
locations, and producing summarized analyses. Existing web benchmarks often
focus on simplistic interactions, such as form submissions or e-commerce
transactions, and often do not require diverse tool-using capabilities required
for web based data science. Conversely, traditional data science benchmarks
typically concentrate on static, often textually bound datasets and do not
assess end-to-end workflows that encompass data acquisition, cleaning,
analysis, and insight generation. In response, we introduce WebDS, the first
end-to-end web-based data science benchmark. It comprises 870 web-based data
science tasks across 29 diverse websites from structured government data
portals to unstructured news media, challenging agents to perform complex,
multi-step operations requiring the use of tools and heterogeneous data formats
that better reflect the realities of modern data analytics. Evaluations of
current SOTA LLM agents indicate significant performance gaps in accomplishing
these tasks. For instance, Browser Use, which accomplishes 80% of tasks on Web
Voyager, successfully completes only 15% of tasks in WebDS, which our analysis
suggests is due to new failure modes like poor information grounding,
repetitive behavior and shortcut-taking that agents performing WebDS' tasks
display. By providing a more robust and realistic testing ground, WebDS sets
the stage for significant advances in the development of practically useful
LLM-based data science.

Motivation: 现有方法忽视LLM的特定失败模式，导致合成问题对性能提升有限。

Method: 采用多专家LLM协作生成、批评和改进问题，结合渐进式学习框架。

Result: 在六个数学基准测试中平均提升12.57%，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: 缺陷感知的多专家框架能有效提升LLM的数学能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in solving mathematical problems, yet
their performance is often limited by the availability of high-quality, diverse
training data. Existing methods focus on augmenting datasets through rephrasing
or difficulty progression but overlook the specific failure modes of LLMs. This
results in synthetic questions that the model can already solve, providing
minimal performance gains. To address this, we propose WarriorMath, a
defect-aware framework for mathematical problem solving that integrates both
targeted data synthesis and progressive training. In the synthesis stage, we
employ multiple expert LLMs in a collaborative process to generate, critique,
and refine problems. Questions that base LLMs fail to solve are identified and
iteratively improved through expert-level feedback, producing high-quality,
defect-aware training data. In the training stage, we introduce a progressive
learning framework that iteratively fine-tunes the model using increasingly
challenging data tailored to its weaknesses. Experiments on six mathematical
benchmarks show that WarriorMath outperforms strong baselines by 12.57% on
average, setting a new state-of-the-art. Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of a defect-aware, multi-expert framework for improving
mathematical ability.

Motivation: 随着AI在教育中的普及，透明度和可解释性需求增加，但现有hackathon很少直接解决教育场景中的XAI问题。

Method: 比赛要求参赛者构建基于逻辑模板的问答系统，使用轻量级LLM或混合系统，并通过Z3验证和专家评审优化数据集。

Result: 挑战赛成功结合了LLM与符号推理，为教育领域的XAI提供了新思路和实践经验。

Conclusion: 该比赛为未来教育XAI系统和研究提供了可操作的见解，推动了透明性和可解释性的发展。

Abstract: The growing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into education has
intensified the need for transparency and interpretability. While hackathons
have long served as agile environments for rapid AI prototyping, few have
directly addressed eXplainable AI (XAI) in real-world educational contexts.
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the XAI Challenge 2025, a
hackathon-style competition jointly organized by Ho Chi Minh City University of
Technology (HCMUT) and the International Workshop on Trustworthiness and
Reliability in Neurosymbolic AI (TRNS-AI), held as part of the International
Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN 2025). The challenge tasked
participants with building Question-Answering (QA) systems capable of answering
student queries about university policies while generating clear, logic-based
natural language explanations. To promote transparency and trustworthiness,
solutions were required to use lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) or
hybrid LLM-symbolic systems. A high-quality dataset was provided, constructed
via logic-based templates with Z3 validation and refined through expert student
review to ensure alignment with real-world academic scenarios. We describe the
challenge's motivation, structure, dataset construction, and evaluation
protocol. Situating the competition within the broader evolution of AI
hackathons, we argue that it represents a novel effort to bridge LLMs and
symbolic reasoning in service of explainability. Our findings offer actionable
insights for future XAI-centered educational systems and competitive research
initiatives.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新视角，认为大语言模型（LLMs）可以通过部分相关知识被“唤醒”，并验证了其在知识图谱问答任务中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索增强生成（RAG）系统在利用部分相关知识时面临挑战，尤其是在知识库不完整的情况下。本文旨在探索LLMs如何通过部分相关知识提升性能。

Method: 通过构造部分相关知识（移除包含答案的路径），并结合理论分析和实验验证，提出了一种基于“唤醒”的方法。

Result: 在知识图谱问答数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于依赖嵌入相似性的传统方法，尤其在实体链接失败的情况下表现更佳。

Conclusion: 部分相关知识可以有效地“唤醒”LLMs，为实际应用中的知识库不完整问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) shows impressive performance by
supplementing and substituting parametric knowledge in Large Language Models
(LLMs). Retrieved knowledge can be divided into three types: explicit answer
evidence, implicit answer clue, and insufficient answer context which can be
further categorized into totally irrelevant and partially relevant information.
Effectively utilizing partially relevant knowledge remains a key challenge for
RAG systems, especially in incomplete knowledge base retrieval. Contrary to the
conventional view, we propose a new perspective: LLMs can be awakened via
partially relevant knowledge already embedded in LLMs. To comprehensively
investigate this phenomenon, the triplets located in the gold reasoning path
and their variants are used to construct partially relevant knowledge by
removing the path that contains the answer. We provide theoretical analysis of
the awakening effect in LLMs and support our hypothesis with experiments on two
Knowledge Graphs (KGs) Question Answering (QA) datasets. Furthermore, we
present a new task, Unseen Entity KGQA, simulating real-world challenges where
entity linking fails due to KG incompleteness. Our awakening-based approach
demonstrates greater efficacy in practical applications, outperforms
traditional methods that rely on embedding-based similarity which are prone to
returning noisy information.

Motivation: 解决现有知识编辑方法（参数级编辑或检索式）在效率和能力保留上的不足。

Method: 采用低秩适应学习上下文编辑知识，设计多样编辑增强技术提升召回率，并引入自适应推理机制动态选择路由。

Result: 在36个案例中的35个表现最佳，显著超越基线方法，验证了其鲁棒性和高效性。

Conclusion: KEDAS为知识编辑对齐提供了理想范式。

Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to modify outdated knowledge in large language models
(LLMs) efficiently while retaining their powerful capabilities. Most existing
methods rely on either parameter-level editing or retrieval-based approaches.
In this work, we propose Knowledge Editing alignment with Diverse Augmentation
and Self-adaptive inference (KEDAS) to better align LLMs with knowledge
editing. In the alignment phase, LLMs learn to apply in-context edited
knowledge via low-rank adaptation. During editing, we design a diverse edit
augmentation technique to improve the recall of edits. After that, a
self-adaptive post-alignment inference mechanism is proposed, in which a
filter-based smart retriever is employed to perform a dynamic selection of
inference routing. Specifically, irrelevant queries will go through the
original pre-alignment model directly, while relevant ones, together with their
related edits, go through the model with aligned adapters activated. In
experiments, KEDAS secures the highest overall performance scores in 35 out of
36 cases across four datasets with three LLMs on three settings, surpassing its
strong knowledge editing alignment counterpart by about 19.8 harmonic mean
scores of edit success, locality and portability and outperforming both
parameter editing and retrieval-based baselines significantly. Analysis of
computational cost and performance on general tasks further validates the
robustness and efficiency of KEDAS, indicating that it presents an ideal
paradigm of knowledge editing alignment.

Abstract: The scarcity and high cost of high-quality question-answering (QA) datasets
hinder supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for domain-specific large language models
(LLMs). To address this, we introduce D-SCoRE, a training-free pipeline that
utilizes LLMs and prompt engineering to produce diverse, high-quality QA

$\textbf{D}$ocument-centric processing, $\textbf{S}$egmentation, $\textbf{Co}$T
$\textbf{R}$easoning, and structured $\textbf{E}$xport to generate QA-COT
datasets tailored for domain-aware SFT. Multi-dimensional control mechanisms,
such as semantic role transformation, question type balancing, and
counterfactual materials, enhance diversity and relevance, overcoming
limitations of existing QA generation. LLMs fine-tuned on D-SCoRE-generated QA
datasets, and human-annotated QA datasets (SQuAD, Covid-QA) are evaluated on
SQuADShifts and Covid-QA test sets, with D-SCoRE outperforming across most
domains. D-SCoRE generates six QA-CoT pairs with four-option counterfactual
materials per 100-200-word text in 90 seconds using an 8B LLM on consumer-grade

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) struggles with the scarcity
of high-quality, diverse training data. To address this limitation, we propose
LinkSyn, a novel knowledge point (KP) graph-based synthesis framework that
enables flexible control over discipline and difficulty distributions while
balancing KP coverage and popularity. LinkSyn extracts KPs from
question-answering (QA) seed data and constructs a KP graph to synthesize
diverse QA data from multiple seeds strongly linked by KPs and sampled from
graph walks. Specifically, LinkSyn incorporates (1) a knowledge distribution
value function to guide the adjustment of path sampling probability and balance
KP coverage and popularity during graph walks; (2) diffusion-based synthesis
via DeepSeek-R1 by leveraging multiple seeds with dense logical associations
along each path; and (3) high-difficulty QA enhancement within given
disciplines by flexible difficulty adjustments. By executing LinkSyn, we
synthesize LinkQA, a diverse multi-disciplinary QA dataset with 50B tokens.
Extensive experiments on Llama-3 8B demonstrate that continual pre-training
with LinkQA yields an average improvement of $\mathbf{11.51\%}$ on MMLU and
CMMLU, establishing new SOTA results. LinkQA consistently enhances performance
across model size and initial FLOPs scales.

Conclusion: BoostQA展示了强大的可扩展性，性能随模型规模、数据量和初始FLOPs的提升而持续改进。

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality, knowledge-intensive training data hinders the
development of large language models (LLMs), as traditional corpora provide
limited information. Previous studies have synthesized and integrated
corpora-dependent question-answering (QA) data to improve model performance but
face challenges in QA data scalability and knowledge diversity, particularly in
cross-domain contexts. Furthermore, leveraging our designed discipline and
difficulty annotation system, we probe model deficiencies in STEM disciplines
and high-difficulty data. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
diversified pipeline to synthesize BoostQA, a 100B-token large-scale QA
dataset. Our synthesis framework: (1) curates seed data from heterogeneous
sources; (2) utilizes DeepSeek-R1 to implement STEM-focused multi-grade
synthesis to boost data diversity and high-difficulty synthesis to mitigate
difficulty degradation; (3) refines answers via DeepSeek-V3 to improve output
quality. We utilize BoostQA in mid-training, a mid-stage between pre-training
and post-training, to optimize domain-specific knowledge acquisition and
enhance data quality. Our method enables Llama-3 8B, mid-trained on a 40B-token
dataset, to achieve an average improvement of $\mathbf{12.74\%}$ on MMLU and
CMMLU and establish SOTA average performance across 12 benchmarks. BoostQA also

At its core, the system employs specialized agents - Researcher, Reviewer,
Writer, and Retriever - that collaborate to analyze data and produce
comprehensive reports. These agents learn from real professional consultants'
presentation materials at Amazon through in-context learning to replicate
professional analytical methodologies. The framework executes a multi-step
process: querying databases, analyzing data, generating insights, creating
visualizations, and composing market reports. We also introduce a novel
LLM-based evaluation system for assessing report quality, which shows alignment
with expert human evaluations. Building on these evaluations, we implement an
iterative improvement mechanism that optimizes report quality through automated
review cycles. Experimental results show that report quality can be improved by
both automated review cycles and consultants' unstructured knowledge. In
experimental validation, our framework generates detailed 6-page reports in 7

TL;DR: BADF框架用于发现LLM中的已知和未知偏见关联，通过开放生成内容分析，提供了一种可扩展的偏见识别工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法依赖预定义的身份-概念关联，无法捕捉新的或意外的偏见形式，因此需要更系统的分析工具。

Method: 提出Bias Association Discovery Framework (BADF)，通过开放生成内容提取身份与概念的关联，覆盖多模型和真实场景。

Result: BADF能够全面映射和分析身份与概念的关联，揭示了开放生成中的偏见模式。

Conclusion: BADF为LLM中的偏见分析提供了可扩展的工具，增进了对开放生成偏见的理解。

Abstract: Social biases embedded in Large Language Models (LLMs) raise critical
concerns, resulting in representational harms -- unfair or distorted portrayals
of demographic groups -- that may be expressed in subtle ways through generated
language. Existing evaluation methods often depend on predefined
identity-concept associations, limiting their ability to surface new or
unexpected forms of bias. In this work, we present the Bias Association
Discovery Framework (BADF), a systematic approach for extracting both known and
previously unrecognized associations between demographic identities and
descriptive concepts from open-ended LLM outputs. Through comprehensive
experiments spanning multiple models and diverse real-world contexts, BADF
enables robust mapping and analysis of the varied concepts that characterize
demographic identities. Our findings advance the understanding of biases in
open-ended generation and provide a scalable tool for identifying and analyzing
bias associations in LLMs. Data, code, and results are available at

TL;DR: ORACLE框架结合知识图谱与LLMs，提升多跳问答任务的性能。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在多跳问答任务中表现不足，因其难以捕捉实体间深层关系。

Method: ORACLE通过动态构建知识本体、转化为逻辑推理链及分解查询三阶段实现。

Result: 在多个标准MQA基准测试中表现优异，媲美当前最优模型。

Conclusion: ORACLE生成更逻辑且可解释的推理链，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their success in question answering,
exhibit limitations in complex multi-hop question answering (MQA) tasks that
necessitate non-linear, structured reasoning. This limitation stems from their
inability to adequately capture deep conceptual relationships between entities.
To overcome this challenge, we present **ORACLE** (**O**ntology-driven
**R**easoning **A**nd **C**hain for **L**ogical **E**ucidation), a
training-free framework that combines LLMs' generative capabilities with the
structural benefits of knowledge graphs. Our approach operates through three
stages: (1) dynamic construction of question-specific knowledge ontologies
using LLMs, (2) transformation of these ontologies into First-Order Logic
reasoning chains, and (3) systematic decomposition of the original query into
logically coherent sub-questions. Experimental results on several standard MQA
benchmarks show that our framework achieves highly competitive performance,
rivaling current state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-R1. Detailed analyses
further confirm the effectiveness of each component, while demonstrating that
our method generates more logical and interpretable reasoning chains than
existing approaches.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DIQ的数据选择策略，通过结合样本难度和梯度影响，优化监督微调（SFT）过程，显著减少计算成本并提升医学推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SFT方法依赖未过滤数据集，导致冗余和低质量样本，计算成本高且性能不佳。需要一种更高效的数据选择策略。

Method: 提出Difficulty-Influence Quadrant (DIQ)策略，优先选择高难度-高梯度影响的样本，以平衡复杂推理和优化效果。

Result: 实验表明，DIQ仅需1%数据即可匹配全数据集性能，10%数据时优于基线。人类和LLM评估显示DIQ生成更符合专家实践的推理。

Conclusion: DIQ通过原则性数据选择显著提升效率，优于暴力扩展方法，为医学推理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) plays a pivotal role in adapting Large Language
Models (LLMs) to specialized domains such as medical reasoning. However,
existing SFT practices often rely on unfiltered datasets that contain redundant
and low-quality samples, leading to substantial computational costs and
suboptimal performance. Although existing methods attempt to alleviate this
problem by selecting data based on sample difficulty, defined by knowledge and
reasoning complexity, they overlook each sample's optimization utility
reflected in its gradient. Interestingly, we find that gradient-based influence
alone favors easy-to-optimize samples that cause large parameter shifts but
lack deep reasoning chains, while difficulty alone selects noisy or overly
complex cases that fail to guide stable optimization. Based on this
observation, we propose a data selection strategy, Difficulty-Influence
Quadrant (DIQ), which prioritizes samples in the high-difficulty-high-influence
quadrant to balance complex clinical reasoning with substantial gradient
influence, enabling efficient medical reasoning with minimal fine-tuning data.
Furthermore, Human and LLM-as-a-judge evaluations show that DIQ-selected
subsets demonstrate higher data quality and generate clinical reasoning that is
more aligned with expert practices in differential diagnosis, safety check, and
evidence citation, as DIQ emphasizes samples that foster expert-like reasoning
patterns. Extensive experiments on medical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate
that DIQ enables models fine-tuned on only 1% of selected data to match
full-dataset performance, while using 10% consistently outperforms the
baseline, highlighting the superiority of principled data selection over
brute-force scaling. The code and data are available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于AST的语法感知扩散框架，用于代码生成任务，显著提升语法正确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在结构化领域（如源代码）的应用面临挑战，传统方法忽略代码的语法和语义结构。

Method: 通过AST选择性破坏语法有意义的代码片段，而非随机标记，以保留语法边界和长程依赖。

Result: 实验表明，语法感知破坏显著提升语法正确性、重构准确性和对未见代码模式的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 将结构信息融入扩散模型训练是提升代码生成任务性能的有前景方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based language models have opened new
possibilities for controllable and bidirectional sequence generation. These
models provide an alternative to traditional autoregressive approaches by
framing text generation as an iterative denoising process. However, applying
diffusion models to structured domains such as source code remains a
significant challenge. Programming languages differ from natural language in
that they follow strict syntactic and semantic rules, with hierarchical
organization that must be preserved for correctness. Standard token-level
corruption techniques used during training often ignore this structure, which
may hinder the model's ability to learn meaningful representations of code. To
address this limitation, we propose a syntax-aware diffusion framework that
incorporates structural priors from Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) into the
denoising process. Instead of masking individual tokens at random, we
selectively corrupt syntactically meaningful code spans derived from AST
subtrees. This enables the model to reconstruct programs in a way that respects
grammatical boundaries and captures long-range dependencies. Experimental
results demonstrate that syntax-aware corruption significantly improves
syntactic correctness, reconstruction accuracy, and generalization to unseen
code patterns. These findings highlight the potential of incorporating
structural information into diffusion-based training and suggest that
syntax-guided denoising is a promising direction for advancing diffusion-based
language models in code generation tasks.

Abstract: Biomedical text mining and question-answering are essential yet highly
demanding tasks, particularly in the face of the exponential growth of
biomedical literature. In this work, we present our participation in the 13th
edition of the BioASQ challenge, which involves biomedical semantic
question-answering for Task 13b and biomedical question-answering for
developing topics for the Synergy task. We deploy a selection of open-source
large language models (LLMs) as retrieval-augmented generators to answer
biomedical questions. Various models are used to process the questions. A
majority voting system combines their output to determine the final answer for
Yes/No questions, while for list and factoid type questions, the union of their
answers in used. We evaluated 13 state-of-the-art open source LLMs, exploring
all possible model combinations to contribute to the final answer, resulting in
tailored LLM pipelines for each question type. Our findings provide valuable
insight into which combinations of LLMs consistently produce superior results
for specific question types. In the four rounds of the 2025 BioASQ challenge,
our system achieved notable results: in the Synergy task, we secured 1st place
for ideal answers and 2nd place for exact answers in round 2, as well as two
shared 1st places for exact answers in round 3 and 4.

Method: 通过爬取多领域文本，构建26,150句数据集，并设计标注平台和协议。微调预训练模型，评估解释性和公平性。

Result: 实验表明，使用标注理由训练可提高模型准确性、减少偏见，并使解释更符合人类推理。

Conclusion: TeSent为泰卢固语NLP任务提供了资源，并验证了标注理由对模型性能的积极影响。

Abstract: In the Indian subcontinent, Telugu, one of India's six classical languages,
is the most widely spoken Dravidian Language. Despite its 96 million speaker
base worldwide, Telugu remains underrepresented in the global NLP and Machine
Learning landscape, mainly due to lack of high-quality annotated resources.
This work introduces TeSent, a comprehensive benchmark dataset for sentiment
classification, a key text classification problem, in Telugu. TeSent not only
provides ground truth labels for the sentences, but also supplements with
provisions for evaluating explainability and fairness, two critical
requirements in modern-day machine learning tasks. We scraped Telugu texts
covering multiple domains from various social media platforms, news websites
and web-blogs to preprocess and generate 26,150 sentences, and developed a
custom-built annotation platform and a carefully crafted annotation protocol
for collecting the ground truth labels along with their human-annotated
rationales. We then fine-tuned several SOTA pre-trained models in two ways:
with rationales, and without rationales. Further, we provide a detailed
plausibility and faithfulness evaluation suite, which exploits the rationales,
for six widely used post-hoc explainers applied on the trained models. Lastly,
we curate TeEEC, Equity Evaluation Corpus in Telugu, a corpus to evaluate
fairness of Telugu sentiment and emotion related NLP tasks, and provide a
fairness evaluation suite for the trained classifier models. Our experimental
results suggest that training with rationales may improve model accuracy,
reduce bias in models, and make the explainers' output more aligned to human
reasoning.

Motivation: 研究动机在于揭示LLMs如何反映和强化主流语言和推理模式，同时边缘化其他声音和策略，进而可能对认知多样性产生负面影响。

Method: 通过综合语言学、认知科学和计算机科学的证据，分析了LLMs的设计和广泛使用如何导致语言和推理的趋同。

Result: 研究发现，LLMs通过反映训练数据中的模式并放大趋同效应，可能导致认知多样性的减少。

Conclusion: 如果不加以控制，这种同质化可能会削弱推动集体智慧和适应性的认知多样性。

Abstract: Cognitive diversity, reflected in variations of language, perspective, and
reasoning, is essential to creativity and collective intelligence. This
diversity is rich and grounded in culture, history, and individual experience.
Yet as large language models (LLMs) become deeply embedded in people's lives,
they risk standardizing language and reasoning. This Review synthesizes
evidence across linguistics, cognitive, and computer science to show how LLMs
reflect and reinforce dominant styles while marginalizing alternative voices
and reasoning strategies. We examine how their design and widespread use
contribute to this effect by mirroring patterns in their training data and
amplifying convergence as all people increasingly rely on the same models
across contexts. Unchecked, this homogenization risks flattening the cognitive
landscapes that drive collective intelligence and adaptability.

with Inquizzitor, an LLM-based formative assessment agent that integrates
human-AI hybrid intelligence and provides feedback grounded in cognitive

assessment and interaction aligned with core learning theories, offering
teachers effective guidance that students value. This research underscores the
potential for theory-driven LLM integration in education, highlighting the

Method: 提出MOPrompt框架，利用多目标进化优化（EMO）同时优化提示的准确性和令牌长度，生成帕累托前沿解集。

Result: 在葡萄牙语情感分析任务中，MOPrompt显著优于基线，例如在Sabiazinho模型上，达到相同峰值准确率（0.97）的同时减少31%令牌长度。

Conclusion: MOPrompt为实际应用中平衡性能与效率提供了有效工具，展示了多目标优化在提示工程中的潜力。

Abstract: Prompt engineering is crucial for unlocking the potential of Large Language
Models (LLMs). Still, since manual prompt design is often complex,
non-intuitive, and time-consuming, automatic prompt optimization has emerged as
a research area. However, a significant challenge in prompt optimization is
managing the inherent trade-off between task performance, such as accuracy, and
context size. Most existing automated methods focus on a single objective,
typically performance, thereby failing to explore the critical spectrum of
efficiency and effectiveness. This paper introduces the MOPrompt, a novel
Multi-objective Evolutionary Optimization (EMO) framework designed to optimize
prompts for both accuracy and context size (measured in tokens) simultaneously.
Our framework maps the Pareto front of prompt solutions, presenting
practitioners with a set of trade-offs between context size and performance, a
crucial tool for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world
applications. We evaluate MOPrompt on a sentiment analysis task in Portuguese,
using Gemma-2B and Sabiazinho-3 as evaluation models. Our findings show that
MOPrompt substantially outperforms the baseline framework. For the Sabiazinho
model, MOPrompt identifies a prompt that achieves the same peak accuracy (0.97)
as the best baseline solution, but with a 31% reduction in token length.

Result: 在多个数据集和LLM上，ComPerturb达到最高攻击成功率，验证了提示结构感知和PPL过滤的有效性。

Conclusion: 提示结构感知和受控扰动对LLM的对抗鲁棒性评估至关重要。

Abstract: Prompt-based adversarial attacks have become an effective means to assess the
robustness of large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches often
treat prompts as monolithic text, overlooking their structural
heterogeneity-different prompt components contribute unequally to adversarial
robustness. Prior works like PromptRobust assume prompts are value-neutral, but
our analysis reveals that complex, domain-specific prompts with rich structures
have components with differing vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we
introduce PromptAnatomy, an automated framework that dissects prompts into
functional components and generates diverse, interpretable adversarial examples
by selectively perturbing each component using our proposed method, ComPerturb.
To ensure linguistic plausibility and mitigate distribution shifts, we further
incorporate a perplexity (PPL)-based filtering mechanism. As a complementary
resource, we annotate four public instruction-tuning datasets using the
PromptAnatomy framework, verified through human review. Extensive experiments
across these datasets and five advanced LLMs demonstrate that ComPerturb
achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates. Ablation studies validate the
complementary benefits of prompt dissection and PPL filtering. Our results
underscore the importance of prompt structure awareness and controlled
perturbation for reliable adversarial robustness evaluation in LLMs. Code and
data are available at https://github.com/Yujiaaaaa/PACP.

Result: 在12个生物医学NER基准测试中，10个达到新的SOTA性能，尤其在疾病和化学实体上表现突出。

Conclusion: OpenMed NER展示了开源模型通过策略性适应可以超越闭源解决方案，同时高效且环保。

Abstract: Named-entity recognition (NER) is fundamental to extracting structured
information from the >80% of healthcare data that resides in unstructured
clinical notes and biomedical literature. Despite recent advances with large
language models, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse entity
types while maintaining computational efficiency remains a significant
challenge. We introduce OpenMed NER, a suite of open-source, domain-adapted
transformer models that combine lightweight domain-adaptive pre-training (DAPT)
with parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our approach performs
cost-effective DAPT on a 350k-passage corpus compiled from ethically sourced,
publicly available research repositories and de-identified clinical notes
(PubMed, arXiv, and MIMIC-III) using DeBERTa-v3, PubMedBERT, and BioELECTRA
backbones. This is followed by task-specific fine-tuning with LoRA, which
updates less than 1.5% of model parameters. We evaluate our models on 12
established biomedical NER benchmarks spanning chemicals, diseases, genes, and
species. OpenMed NER achieves new state-of-the-art micro-F1 scores on 10 of
these 12 datasets, with substantial gains across diverse entity types. Our
models advance the state-of-the-art on foundational disease and chemical
benchmarks (e.g., BC5CDR-Disease, +2.70 pp), while delivering even larger
improvements of over 5.3 and 9.7 percentage points on more specialized gene and
clinical cell line corpora. This work demonstrates that strategically adapted
open-source models can surpass closed-source solutions. This performance is
achieved with remarkable efficiency: training completes in under 12 hours on a
single GPU with a low carbon footprint (< 1.2 kg CO2e), producing permissively
licensed, open-source checkpoints designed to help practitioners facilitate
compliance with emerging data protection and AI regulations, such as the EU AI
Act.

Motivation: 随着LLM生成文本与人类文本难以区分，传统的二元分类方法已不足以应对多样化的LLM生成器，需要更细粒度的多语言作者归属方法。

Method: 研究18种语言和8种生成器，评估单语言AA方法在多语言环境中的适用性和跨语言迁移能力。

Result: 某些单语言AA方法可适应多语言环境，但在跨语言家族迁移时存在显著局限性。

Conclusion: 多语言作者归属具有复杂性，需更鲁棒的方法以匹配现实场景。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) have reached human-like fluency and
coherence, distinguishing machine-generated text (MGT) from human-written
content becomes increasingly difficult. While early efforts in MGT detection
have focused on binary classification, the growing landscape and diversity of
LLMs require a more fine-grained yet challenging authorship attribution (AA),
i.e., being able to identify the precise generator (LLM or human) behind a
text. However, AA remains nowadays confined to a monolingual setting, with
English being the most investigated one, overlooking the multilingual nature
and usage of modern LLMs. In this work, we introduce the problem of
Multilingual Authorship Attribution, which involves attributing texts to human
or multiple LLM generators across diverse languages. Focusing on 18 languages
-- covering multiple families and writing scripts -- and 8 generators (7 LLMs
and the human-authored class), we investigate the multilingual suitability of
monolingual AA methods, their cross-lingual transferability, and the impact of
generators on attribution performance. Our results reveal that while certain
monolingual AA methods can be adapted to multilingual settings, significant
limitations and challenges remain, particularly in transferring across diverse
language families, underscoring the complexity of multilingual AA and the need
for more robust approaches to better match real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 现实中的用户偏好是动态且依赖于上下文的，而现有LLMs通常假设用户偏好是静态的。

Method: 引入CUPID基准，包含756个人工标注的用户与LLM交互会话，评估LLMs在新请求中推断和应用偏好的能力。

Conclusion: LLMs需提升上下文个性化能力，CUPID可作为推动改进的资源。

Abstract: Personalization of Large Language Models (LLMs) often assumes users hold
static preferences that reflect globally in all tasks. In reality, humans hold
dynamic preferences that change depending on the context. As users interact
with an LLM in various contexts, they naturally reveal their contextual
preferences, which a model must infer and apply in future contexts to ensure
alignment. To assess this, we introduce CUPID, a benchmark of 756 human-curated
interaction session histories between users and LLM-based chat assistants. In
each interaction session, the user provides a request in a specific context and
expresses their preference through multi-turn feedback. Given a new user
request and prior interaction sessions, our benchmark assesses whether LLMs can
infer the preference relevant to this request and generate a response that
satisfies this preference. With CUPID, we evaluated 10 open and proprietary
LLMs, revealing that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to infer preferences from
multi-turn interactions and fail to discern what previous context is relevant
to a new request -- under 50% precision and 65% recall. Our work highlights the
need to advance LLM capabilities for more contextually personalized
interactions and proposes CUPID as a resource to drive these improvements.

### [262] [The Bidirectional Process Reward Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01682)
*Lingyin Zhang,Jun Gao,Xiaoxue Ren,Ziqiang Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BiPRM提出了一种双向评估范式，通过结合右到左（R2L）和左到右（L2R）的评估流，提升了过程奖励模型（PRM）的推理质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PRM采用单向左到右（L2R）评估，无法利用全局上下文验证早期步骤的连贯性。

Method: BiPRM通过简单的提示修改实现R2L评估，无需额外参数或延迟。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，BiPRM显著优于单向基线，最高提升31.9%。

Conclusion: BiPRM高效、兼容性强，为过程奖励建模提供了新方向。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising approach to enhance
the reasoning quality of Large Language Models (LLMs) by assigning fine-grained
scores to intermediate reasoning steps within a solution trajectory. However,
existing PRMs predominantly adopt a unidirectional left-to-right (L2R)
evaluation paradigm, which limits their ability to leverage global context,
making it challenging to verify the consistency of earlier steps based on later
ones. In light of these challenges, we propose a novel bidirectional evaluation
paradigm, named Bidirectional Process Reward Model (BiPRM). BiPRM seamlessly
incorporates a parallel right-to-left (R2L) evaluation stream alongside the
conventional L2R flow, enabling later reasoning steps to help assess earlier
ones in real time. Notably, the built-in R2L evaluation is implemented solely
through prompt modifications that reverse the original reasoning trajectory,
without any additional parameters or inference latency introduced. This ensures
BiPRM remains both efficient and broadly compatible with existing PRM studies.
We conduct extensive experiments on two mathematical reasoning benchmarks using
samples generated by three different policy models. Our method, BiPRM, is
evaluated across three backbones and three distinct PRM objectives. Across all
settings, BiPRM consistently outperforms unidirectional baselines, achieving up
to a 31.9% improvement in stepwise reward evaluation. Generally, our results
highlight BiPRM's effectiveness, robustness, and general applicability,
offering a promising new direction for process-based reward modeling.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Collaborative Chain-of-Agents（CoCoA）的框架，通过多代理协同增强检索增强生成（RAG）中参数化知识与检索知识的结合能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG方法在生成过程中未能充分利用知识，尤其是参数化知识与检索知识之间的协同作用不足，导致生成内容可能被误导或未能充分利用检索信息。

Method: 提出CoCoA-zero框架，通过多代理进行条件知识归纳和答案推理；进一步开发CoCoA，通过长链训练策略合成多代理推理轨迹以微调LLM。

Result: 实验表明，CoCoA-zero和CoCoA在开放域和多跳QA任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: CoCoA框架有效提升了参数化知识与检索知识的协同利用能力，显著提升了RAG的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising framework for
enhancing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially in
knowledge-intensive tasks. Despite its advantages, current RAG methods often
struggle to *fully exploit knowledge during generation*. In particular, the
synergy between the model's internal parametric knowledge and external
retrieved knowledge remains limited. Retrieved contents may sometimes mislead
generation, while certain generated content can guide the model toward more
accurate outputs. In this work, we propose Collaborative Chain-of-Agents, a
framework designed to enhance explicitly synergy over both parametric and
retrieved knowledge. Specifically, we first introduce CoCoA-zero, a multi-agent
RAG framework that first performs conditional knowledge induction and then
reasons answers. Building on this, we develop CoCoA, a long-chain training
strategy that synthesizes extended multi-agent reasoning trajectories from
CoCoA-zero to fine-tune the LLM. This strategy enhances the model's capability
to explicitly integrate and jointly leverage parametric and retrieved
knowledge. Experiments results show that CoCoA-zero and CoCoA achieve superior
performance on open-domain and multi-hop QA tasks.

Motivation: LLM在整合广泛上下文时易引入无关信息，现有研究关注语义泄漏，本文提出表达泄漏这一新现象，旨在分析其影响及缓解方法。

Method: 收集基准数据集并设计自动生成方案，提出与人工评估一致的自动评估流程，实验分析模型规模和情感注入对表达泄漏的影响。

Result: 模型规模增加可减少表达泄漏，但需在模型构建中特别处理；负面情感注入比正面情感更易导致表达泄漏。

Conclusion: 表达泄漏需在模型构建阶段针对性解决，无法通过提示缓解，模型规模扩大有助于减少泄漏。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced natural language processing (NLP)
skills such as through next-token prediction and self-attention, but their
ability to integrate broad context also makes them prone to incorporating
irrelevant information. Prior work has focused on semantic leakage, bias
introduced by semantically irrelevant context. In this paper, we introduce
expression leakage, a novel phenomenon where LLMs systematically generate
sentimentally charged expressions that are semantically unrelated to the input
context. To analyse the expression leakage, we collect a benchmark dataset
along with a scheme to automatically generate a dataset from free-form text
from common-crawl. In addition, we propose an automatic evaluation pipeline
that correlates well with human judgment, which accelerates the benchmarking by
decoupling from the need of annotation for each analysed model. Our experiments
show that, as the model scales in the parameter space, the expression leakage
reduces within the same LLM family. On the other hand, we demonstrate that
expression leakage mitigation requires specific care during the model building
process, and cannot be mitigated by prompting. In addition, our experiments
indicate that, when negative sentiment is injected in the prompt, it disrupts
the generation process more than the positive sentiment, causing a higher
expression leakage rate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非英语语言缺乏高质量的文化对齐安全数据集，导致多语言LLMs在安全防护上存在不足。

Method: 采用四阶段流程：文化数据隔离、文化数据适应、机器翻译和质量过滤，扩展英语数据集到多语言。

Result: 生成包含386,661样本的多语言数据集，训练出的模型在多语言安全基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: CultureGuard填补了多语言LLMs安全防护的空白，提升了非英语语言的安全性能。

Abstract: The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in agentic applications
highlights the need for robust safety guard models. While content safety in
English is well-studied, non-English languages lack similar advancements due to
the high cost of collecting culturally aligned labeled datasets. We present
CultureGuard, a novel solution for curating culturally aligned, high-quality
safety datasets across multiple languages. Our approach introduces a four-stage
synthetic data generation and filtering pipeline: cultural data segregation,
cultural data adaptation, machine translation, and quality filtering. This
pipeline enables the conversion and expansion of the
Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-V2 English safety dataset into eight distinct
languages: Arabic, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Thai, and Chinese.
The resulting dataset, Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-Multilingual-v1,
comprises 386,661 samples in 9 languages and facilitates the training of
Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Safety-Guard-Multilingual-8B-v1 via LoRA-based fine-tuning.
The final model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several multilingual
content safety benchmarks. We also benchmark the latest open LLMs on
multilingual safety and observe that these LLMs are more prone to give unsafe
responses when prompted in non-English languages. This work represents a
significant step toward closing the safety gap in multilingual LLMs by enabling
the development of culturally aware safety guard models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多轮对话中用户偏好的高质量标注数据难以获取，标注过程复杂且容易出错，影响了模型训练效果。

Method: 构建新数据格式，将对话数据分为历史偏好和单轮对话，利用GPT4预定义偏好槽并随机采样生成高质量数据集。

Result: 新数据格式在微调或少样本提示下表现优于原始多轮对话，标注效率提高了28.4%。

Conclusion: IterChat框架有效解决了多轮偏好标注的困难，提升了模型性能和标注效率。

Abstract: Identifying user preferences in dialogue systems is a pivotal aspect of
providing satisfying services. Current research shows that using large language
models (LLMs) to fine-tune a task-specific preference extractor yields
excellent results in terms of accuracy and generalization. However, the primary
challenge stems from the inherent difficulty in obtaining high-quality labeled
multi-turn dialogue data. Accurately tracking user preference transitions
across turns not only demands intensive domain expertise and contextual
consistency maintenance for annotators (termed \textbf{``Annotating
Disaster''}) but also complicates model training due to error propagation in
sequential dependency learning. Inspired by the observation that multi-turn
preference extraction can be decomposed into iterative executions of one-turn
extraction processes. We propose a novel dialogue data generation framework
named \textbf{IterChat}. First, we construct a new data format that categorizes
the dialogue data into attributed historical preferences and one-turn
dialogues. This reduces the probability of annotation errors and improves
annotation efficiency. Then, to generate a high-quality and diverse dialogue
dataset, we adopt GPT4 to pre-define the preference slots in the target
preference extractor task and then randomly sample the subset of the slots and
their corresponding schema values to create the dialogue datasets. Experimental
results indicate that fine-tuning or only few-shot prompting with the new
dialogue format yields superior performance compared to the original multi-turn
dialogues. Additionally, the new data format improves annotator efficiency with
a win rate of 28.4\% higher than the original multi-turn dialogues.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的AI生成文本检测方法TDT，通过保留位置信息并利用信号处理技术，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将标记级测量聚合为标量分数，忽略了位置信息，导致对抗性攻击下性能下降。

Method: 提出Temporal Discrepancy Tomography (TDT)，将标记级差异视为时间序列信号，应用连续小波变换生成二维时间尺度表示。

Result: 在RAID基准测试中，TDT的AUROC达到0.855（比最佳基线提升7.1%），对抗性任务中提升14.1%。

Conclusion: TDT证明了非平稳性是AI生成文本的基本特征，保留时间动态对鲁棒检测至关重要。

Abstract: The field of AI-generated text detection has evolved from supervised
classification to zero-shot statistical analysis. However, current approaches
share a fundamental limitation: they aggregate token-level measurements into
scalar scores, discarding positional information about where anomalies occur.
Our empirical analysis reveals that AI-generated text exhibits significant
non-stationarity, statistical properties vary by 73.8\% more between text
segments compared to human writing. This discovery explains why existing
detectors fail against localized adversarial perturbations that exploit this
overlooked characteristic. We introduce Temporal Discrepancy Tomography (TDT),
a novel detection paradigm that preserves positional information by
reformulating detection as a signal processing task. TDT treats token-level
discrepancies as a time-series signal and applies Continuous Wavelet Transform
to generate a two-dimensional time-scale representation, capturing both the
location and linguistic scale of statistical anomalies. On the RAID benchmark,
TDT achieves 0.855 AUROC (7.1\% improvement over the best baseline). More
importantly, TDT demonstrates robust performance on adversarial tasks, with
14.1\% AUROC improvement on HART Level 2 paraphrasing attacks. Despite its
sophisticated analysis, TDT maintains practical efficiency with only 13\%
computational overhead. Our work establishes non-stationarity as a fundamental
characteristic of AI-generated text and demonstrates that preserving temporal
dynamics is essential for robust detection.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
yet their propensity for hallucination, generating plausible but factually
incorrect or fabricated content, remains a critical challenge. This report
provides a comprehensive taxonomy of LLM hallucinations, beginning with a
formal definition and a theoretical framework that posits its inherent
inevitability in computable LLMs, irrespective of architecture or training. It
explores core distinctions, differentiating between intrinsic (contradicting
input context) and extrinsic (inconsistent with training data or reality), as
well as factuality (absolute correctness) and faithfulness (adherence to
input). The report then details specific manifestations, including factual
errors, contextual and logical inconsistencies, temporal disorientation,
ethical violations, and task-specific hallucinations across domains like code
generation and multimodal applications. It analyzes the underlying causes,
categorizing them into data-related issues, model-related factors, and
prompt-related influences. Furthermore, the report examines cognitive and human
factors influencing hallucination perception, surveys evaluation benchmarks and
metrics for detection, and outlines architectural and systemic mitigation
strategies. Finally, it introduces web-based resources for monitoring LLM
releases and performance. This report underscores the complex, multifaceted
nature of LLM hallucinations and emphasizes that, given their theoretical
inevitability, future efforts must focus on robust detection, mitigation, and
continuous human oversight for responsible and reliable deployment in critical
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有希伯来语NLP基准主要关注形态句法任务，忽略了语义理解。为了填补这一空白，作者旨在构建一个希伯来语MRC数据集，并解决形态复杂性带来的标注和评估问题。

Method: 设计了新的标注指南、众包协议和评估指标，构建了包含30,147个问答对的HeQ数据集，数据来源包括希伯来语维基百科和以色列科技新闻。

Result: 研究发现标准评估指标（如F1和EM）不适用于希伯来语，提出了改进方法；同时发现形态句法和语义任务之间的模型性能相关性较低。

Conclusion: HeQ的开发揭示了形态丰富语言（MRL）在自然语言理解中的挑战，为希伯来语和其他MRL的NLU模型发展提供了支持。

Abstract: Current benchmarks for Hebrew Natural Language Processing (NLP) focus mainly
on morpho-syntactic tasks, neglecting the semantic dimension of language
understanding. To bridge this gap, we set out to deliver a Hebrew Machine
Reading Comprehension (MRC) dataset, where MRC is to be realized as extractive
Question Answering. The morphologically rich nature of Hebrew poses a challenge
to this endeavor: the indeterminacy and non-transparency of span boundaries in
morphologically complex forms lead to annotation inconsistencies,
disagreements, and flaws in standard evaluation metrics.
  To remedy this, we devise a novel set of guidelines, a controlled
crowdsourcing protocol, and revised evaluation metrics that are suitable for
the morphologically rich nature of the language. Our resulting benchmark, HeQ
(Hebrew QA), features 30,147 diverse question-answer pairs derived from both
Hebrew Wikipedia articles and Israeli tech news. Our empirical investigation
reveals that standard evaluation metrics such as F1 scores and Exact Match (EM)
are not appropriate for Hebrew (and other MRLs), and we propose a relevant
enhancement.
  In addition, our experiments show low correlation between models' performance
on morpho-syntactic tasks and on MRC, which suggests that models designed for
the former might underperform on semantics-heavy tasks. The development and
exploration of HeQ illustrate some of the challenges MRLs pose in natural
language understanding (NLU), fostering progression towards more and better NLU
models for Hebrew and other MRLs.

Conclusion: 基于代理的模式感知推理可扩展知识图谱问答，支持可持续性领域的跨图谱推理决策。

Abstract: Question answering over heterogeneous knowledge graphs (KGQA) involves
reasoning across diverse schemas, incomplete alignments, and distributed data
sources. Existing text-to-SPARQL approaches rely on large-scale domain-specific
fine-tuning or operate within single-graph settings, limiting their
generalizability in low-resource domains and their ability to handle queries
spanning multiple graphs. These challenges are particularly relevant in domains
such as the circular economy, where information about classifications,
processes, and emissions is distributed across independently curated knowledge
graphs (KGs). We present AgenticT$^2$S, a modular framework that decomposes
KGQA into subtasks managed by specialized agents responsible for retrieval,
query generation, and verification. A scheduler assigns subgoals to different
graphs using weak-to-strong alignment strategies. A two-stage verifier detects
structurally invalid and semantically underspecified queries through symbolic
validation and counterfactual consistency checks. Experiments on real-world
circular economy KGs demonstrate that AgenticT$^2$S improves execution accuracy
by 17.3% and triple level F$_1$ by 25.4% over the best baseline, while reducing
the average prompt length by 46.4%. These results demonstrate the benefits of
agent-based schema-aware reasoning for scalable KGQA and support
decision-making in sustainability domains through robust cross-graph reasoning.

Conclusion: 该方法通过解耦记忆与解码器，显著提升了LLM的性能和推理效率，同时减少了幻觉问题。

Abstract: While modern decoder-only LLMs achieve superior performance across various
domains, hallucinations have risen to be a common problem in their generated
text, hindering their application in knowledge-intensive tasks.
Retriever-augmented generation (RAG) offers a solution, but the non-parametric
nature of the retriever hinders its deep interaction with LLM. In this work, we
propose to decouple memorization from the LLM decoder using a pretrained,
differentiable external memory. The external memory is an MLP pretrained by
imitating the behavior of a retriever on the entire pretraining dataset. Our
resulting architecture, which comprises a transformer decoder and an external
MLP memory pretrained on language modeling and retriever imitation
respectively, demonstrates strong perplexity and performance on downstream
tasks. Experiments show our architecture exhibits steeper power-law scaling
with model size, achieving 17.5% and 24.1% improvement on WikiText-103 and Web
datasets compared to decoder-only models while benefiting from added training
without overfitting. We demonstrate superior performance on three hallucination
benchmarks and nine memory-intensive tasks. Additionally, our approach delivers
$80\times$ speedup over $k$NN-LM (500M tokens) and $1.3\times$ faster inference
than decoder-only models. Unlike $k$NN-LM, which impairs reasoning, our MLP
memory improves StrategyQA performance. We will open-source our code and models
in the future.

Abstract: Multimodal large-scale models have significantly advanced the development of
web agents, enabling perception and interaction with digital environments akin
to human cognition. In this paper, we argue that web agents must first acquire
sufficient knowledge to effectively engage in cognitive reasoning. Therefore,
we decompose a web agent's capabilities into two essential stages: knowledge
content learning and cognitive processes. To formalize this, we propose
Web-CogKnowledge Framework, categorizing knowledge as Factual, Conceptual, and
Procedural. In this framework, knowledge content learning corresponds to the
agent's processes of Memorizing and Understanding, which rely on the first two
knowledge types, representing the "what" of learning. Conversely, cognitive
processes correspond to Exploring, grounded in Procedural knowledge, defining
the "how" of reasoning and action. To facilitate knowledge acquisition, we
construct the Web-CogDataset, a structured resource curated from 14 real-world
websites, designed to systematically instill core knowledge necessary for web
agent. This dataset serves as the agent's conceptual grounding-the "nouns" upon
which comprehension is built-as well as the basis for learning how to reason
and act. Building on this foundation, we operationalize these processes through
a novel knowledge-driven Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning framework, developing
and training our proposed agent, the Web-CogReasoner. Extensive experimentation
reveals its significant superiority over existing models, especially in
generalizing to unseen tasks where structured knowledge is decisive. To enable
rigorous evaluation, we introduce the Web-CogBench, a comprehensive evaluation
suite designed to assess and compare agent performance across the delineated
knowledge domains and cognitive capabilities. Our code and data is open sourced

Motivation: 大语言模型虽然表现出色，但常生成流畅但事实错误或未经支持的幻觉输出，需要一种有效的方法来检测和缓解这一问题。

Method: 动态生成看似合理但包含细微事实错误的反事实陈述，评估模型对这些变化的敏感性，利用知识对反事实变化的稳健性区分真实内容和幻觉内容。

Result: 在TruthfulQA、事实陈述数据集和幻觉示例上的评估表明，该方法检测性能优于基线方法，自适应缓解策略平均减少幻觉分数24.5%。

Conclusion: Counterfactual Probing无需模型重新训练，可作为实时验证机制集成到现有LLM流程中，有效减少幻觉输出。

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse tasks, yet they frequently generate hallucinations outputs that are
fluent but factually incorrect or unsupported. We propose Counterfactual
Probing, a novel approach for detecting and mitigating hallucinations in LLM
outputs. Our method dynamically generates counterfactual statements that appear
plausible but contain subtle factual errors, then evaluates the model's
sensitivity to these perturbations. We hypothesize that genuine knowledge
exhibits robustness to counterfactual variations, while hallucinated content
shows inconsistent confidence patterns when confronted with plausible
alternatives. Our comprehensive evaluation on TruthfulQA, factual statement
datasets, and curated hallucination examples demonstrates that counterfactual
probing achieves superior detection performance compared to baseline methods,
while our adaptive mitigation strategies reduce hallucination scores by an
average of 24.5%. The approach requires no model retraining and can be
integrated into existing LLM pipelines as a realtime verification mechanism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言（如旁遮普语）在大语言模型中的缺失问题，提供可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 1. 训练PunGPT2模型，优化分词器和预训练目标；2. 开发Pun-RAG检索增强框架；3. 提出Quantum-RAG混合检索系统。

Result: 模型在多语言基准测试中表现优异，显著优于mBERT、mT5等。

Conclusion: 该工作为低资源语言的大语言模型开发提供了可扩展的蓝图，并首次将量子表示应用于语言生成。

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), low-resource
languages remain largely excluded from the NLP landscape. We present PunGPT2,
the first fully open-source suite of Punjabi large language models, trained
from scratch on a 35GB domain-diverse corpus encompassing literature, religious
texts, news, and social discourse. Unlike prior multilingual approaches,
PunGPT2 captures rich syntactic and morphological features unique to Punjabi
through a tokenizer optimised with byte pair encoding and linguistically
aligned pretraining objectives. To improve factual grounding and domain recall,
we introduce Pun-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework combining
PunGPT2 with a dense FAISS retriever over a curated Punjabi knowledge base. We
further develop Pun-Instruct, a parameter-efficient, instruction-tuned variant
using QLoRA, enabling robust zero-shot and instruction-following performance
with significantly reduced compute needs.
  As a key innovation, we propose Quantum-RAG, a novel hybrid retrieval system
that fuses sparse (BM25) and dense methods with quantum-inspired semantic
matching. By encoding queries using amplitude-based embeddings and retrieving
via quantum kernel similarity, Quantum-RAG achieves improved contextual

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）过度使用特定词汇（如“delve”和“intricate”）的原因，发现人类反馈学习（LHF）是主要因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs过度使用某些词汇的原因尚不明确，研究旨在揭示LHF对词汇选择的影响。

Method: 使用Meta的Llama模型，提出检测LHF诱导词汇偏好的方法，并通过实验模拟LHF过程验证。

Result: 实验表明LHF导致词汇过度使用，且不同人群（LHF工作者与LLM用户）的词汇期望存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究强调了数据和过程透明在AI对齐研究中的重要性，为可解释AI提供了新见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to overuse certain terms like "delve"
and "intricate." The exact reasons for these lexical choices, however, have
been unclear. Using Meta's Llama model, this study investigates the
contribution of Learning from Human Feedback (LHF), under which we subsume
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback and Direct Preference Optimization.
We present a straightforward procedure for detecting the lexical preferences of
LLMs that are potentially LHF-induced. Next, we more conclusively link LHF to
lexical overuse by experimentally emulating the LHF procedure and demonstrating
that participants systematically prefer text variants that include certain
words. This lexical overuse can be seen as a sort of misalignment, though our
study highlights the potential divergence between the lexical expectations of
different populations -- namely LHF workers versus LLM users. Our work
contributes to the growing body of research on explainable artificial
intelligence and emphasizes the importance of both data and procedural
transparency in alignment research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ROVER框架通过递归分解长视频轨迹为短子任务段，提升视觉语言模型在视频推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在需要处理长视频帧序列时表现不佳，限制了其在具身任务中的应用。

Method: 提出ROVER框架，递归分解视频轨迹为子任务段，结合上下文学习实现更精准的推理。

Result: ROVER在任务进度估计、帧级自然语言推理和视频问答任务中优于基线模型，减少了幻觉现象。

Conclusion: ROVER通过优化推理范围和线性时间复杂度，显著提升了长视频推理能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities across
diverse image understanding tasks, but still struggle in settings that require
reasoning over extended sequences of camera frames from a video. This limits
their utility in embodied settings, which require reasoning over long frame
sequences from a continuous stream of visual input at each moment of a task
attempt. To address this limitation, we propose ROVER (Reasoning Over VidEo
Recursively), a framework that enables the model to recursively decompose
long-horizon video trajectories into segments corresponding to shorter subtasks
within the trajectory. In doing so, ROVER facilitates more focused and accurate
reasoning over temporally localized frame sequences without losing global
context. We evaluate ROVER, implemented using an in-context learning approach,
on diverse OpenX Embodiment videos and on a new dataset derived from RoboCasa
that consists of 543 videos showing both expert and perturbed non-expert
trajectories across 27 robotic manipulation tasks. ROVER outperforms strong
baselines across three video reasoning tasks: task progress estimation,
frame-level natural language reasoning, and video question answering. We
observe that, by reducing the number of frames the model reasons over at each
timestep, ROVER mitigates hallucinations, especially during unexpected or
non-optimal moments of a trajectory. In addition, by enabling the
implementation of a subtask-specific sliding context window, ROVER's time
complexity scales linearly with video length, an asymptotic improvement over
baselines. Demos, code, and data available at: https://rover-vlm.github.io

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于上下文的短文本块嵌入方法（SitEmb），通过结合更广泛的上下文信息提升检索性能，并在实验中显著优于现有嵌入模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将长文档分割为短块进行检索，但由于上下文依赖，短块的信息可能不完整。现有嵌入模型难以有效编码长上下文，导致检索性能受限。

Method: 提出SitEmb模型，通过训练范式改进短块的上下文嵌入表示，并开发了基于BGE-M3的SitEmb-v1和SitEmb-v1.5模型。

Result: 在书情节检索数据集上，SitEmb-v1显著优于现有模型，SitEmb-v1.5进一步提升了10%的性能，并在多语言和下游任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: SitEmb方法通过结合上下文信息有效提升了检索性能，为长文档检索提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) over long documents typically involves
splitting the text into smaller chunks, which serve as the basic units for
retrieval. However, due to dependencies across the original document,
contextual information is often essential for accurately interpreting each
chunk. To address this, prior work has explored encoding longer context windows
to produce embeddings for longer chunks. Despite these efforts, gains in
retrieval and downstream tasks remain limited. This is because (1) longer
chunks strain the capacity of embedding models due to the increased amount of
information they must encode, and (2) many real-world applications still
require returning localized evidence due to constraints on model or human
bandwidth.
  We propose an alternative approach to this challenge by representing short
chunks in a way that is conditioned on a broader context window to enhance
retrieval performance -- i.e., situating a chunk's meaning within its context.
We further show that existing embedding models are not well-equipped to encode
such situated context effectively, and thus introduce a new training paradigm
and develop the situated embedding models (SitEmb). To evaluate our method, we
curate a book-plot retrieval dataset specifically designed to assess situated
retrieval capabilities. On this benchmark, our SitEmb-v1 model based on BGE-M3
substantially outperforms state-of-the-art embedding models, including several
with up to 7-8B parameters, with only 1B parameters. Our 8B SitEmb-v1.5 model
further improves performance by over 10% and shows strong results across
different languages and several downstream applications.

Abstract: To address the severe data scarcity in Tibetan, a low-resource language
spoken by over six million people, we introduce TIBSTC-CoT, the large-scale,
multi-domain Tibetan dataset automatically constructed via chain-of-thought
prompting with large language models (LLMs). TIBSTC-CoT establishes a scalable

Sunshine-thinking LLM family, a series of Tibetan-centric LLMs equipped with
chain-of-thought capabilities. Trained entirely on TIBSTC-CoT,
Sunshine-thinking has demonstrated strong reasoning and generation performance,
comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) multilingual LLMs. Our work marks a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电商产品页面信息繁杂，现有问答系统未能有效利用用户上下文和多样化产品信息，导致用户认知负担。

Method: 采用RAG框架，结合对话历史、用户画像和产品属性，处理多源异构查询并识别信息缺口。

Result: 系统能够高效处理客观、主观和多意图查询，同时支持内容改进。

Conclusion: 该框架为电商问答系统提供了可扩展的解决方案，并提出了适用于RAG系统评估的新指标。

Abstract: E-commerce product pages contain a mix of structured specifications,
unstructured reviews, and contextual elements like personalized offers or
regional variants. Although informative, this volume can lead to cognitive
overload, making it difficult for users to quickly and accurately find the
information they need. Existing Product Question Answering (PQA) systems often
fail to utilize rich user context and diverse product information effectively.
We propose a scalable, end-to-end framework for e-commerce PQA using Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) that deeply integrates contextual understanding. Our
system leverages conversational history, user profiles, and product attributes
to deliver relevant and personalized answers. It adeptly handles objective,
subjective, and multi-intent queries across heterogeneous sources, while also
identifying information gaps in the catalog to support ongoing content
improvement. We also introduce novel metrics to measure the framework's
performance which are broadly applicable for RAG system evaluations.

Conclusion: 研究表明，简单的零样本提示在微调模型上表现最佳，代码已开源。

Abstract: Social media, such as Twitter, provides opportunities for caregivers of
dementia patients to share their experiences and seek support for a variety of
reasons. Availability of this information online also paves the way for the
development of internet-based interventions in their support. However, for this
purpose, tweets written by caregivers of dementia patients must first be
identified. This paper demonstrates our system for the SMM4H 2025 shared task
3, which focuses on detecting tweets posted by individuals who have a family
member with dementia. The task is outlined as a binary classification problem,
differentiating between tweets that mention dementia in the context of a family
member and those that do not. Our solution to this problem explores large
language models (LLMs) with various prompting methods. Our results show that a
simple zero-shot prompt on a fine-tuned model yielded the best results. Our
final system achieved a macro F1-score of 0.95 on the validation set and the
test set. Our full code is available on GitHub.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注文本模态，忽视了语音在交互场景中的重要性，缺乏对SRPAs的系统性评估。

Method: 构建了包含98种角色和112k语音对话的SpeechRole-Data数据集，并提出多维评估基准SpeechRole-Eval。

Result: 实验结果显示级联和端到端SRPAs在保持语音风格一致性和角色连贯性方面的优势与挑战。

Conclusion: 论文为语音驱动的多模态角色扮演研究提供了数据和评估基础，推动了该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Recently, role-playing agents have emerged as a promising paradigm for
achieving personalized interaction and emotional resonance. Existing research
primarily focuses on the textual modality, neglecting the critical dimension of
speech in realistic interactive scenarios. In particular, there is a lack of
systematic evaluation for Speech Role-Playing Agents (SRPAs). To address this
gap, we construct SpeechRole-Data, a large-scale, high-quality dataset that
comprises 98 diverse roles and 112k speech-based single-turn and multi-turn
conversations. Each role demonstrates distinct vocal characteristics, including
timbre and prosody, thereby enabling more sophisticated speech role-playing.
Furthermore, we propose SpeechRole-Eval, a multidimensional evaluation
benchmark that systematically assesses SRPAs performance in key aspects such as
fundamental interaction ability, speech expressiveness, and role-playing
fidelity. Experimental results reveal the advantages and challenges of both
cascaded and end-to-end speech role-playing agents in maintaining vocal style
consistency and role coherence. We release all data, code, and baseline models
to provide a solid foundation for speech-driven multimodal role-playing
research and to foster further developments in this field.

TL;DR: SpeechR是一个统一的基准测试，用于评估大型音频语言模型在语音推理方面的能力，填补了现有评估在上下文和推理驱动能力上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注表面感知能力，而忽略了模型在语音场景中的上下文和推理能力，因此需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: SpeechR通过三个关键维度（事实检索、程序推理和规范性判断）和三种评估格式（选择题、生成式和声学特征）来评估模型。

Result: 评估11种先进模型后发现，高转录准确率并不等同于强大的推理能力。

Conclusion: SpeechR为语音推理提供了结构化基准，有助于更精准地分析模型在多样化对话任务中的能力。

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) have achieved near-human performance in
sentence-level transcription and emotion recognition. However, existing
evaluations focus mainly on surface-level perception, leaving the capacity of
models for contextual and inference-driven reasoning in speech-based scenarios
insufficiently examined. To address this gap, we introduce SpeechR, a unified
benchmark for evaluating reasoning over speech in large audio-language models.
SpeechR evaluates models along three key dimensions: factual retrieval,
procedural inference, and normative judgment. It includes three distinct
evaluation formats. The multiple-choice version measures answer selection
accuracy. The generative version assesses the coherence and logical consistency
of reasoning chains. The acoustic-feature version investigates whether
variations in stress and emotion affect reasoning performance. Evaluations on
eleven state-of-the-art LALMs reveal that high transcription accuracy does not
translate into strong reasoning capabilities. SpeechR establishes a structured
benchmark for evaluating reasoning in spoken language, enabling more targeted
analysis of model capabilities across diverse dialogue-based tasks.

TL;DR: STIM框架通过标记级记忆源分析揭示LLMs在复杂或长尾任务中依赖记忆，尤其是局部记忆导致错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在推理任务中表现良好，但输入微小变化时易失败，引发对记忆依赖的担忧。

Method: 提出STIM框架，基于预训练语料统计共现，将推理链中每个标记归因于局部、中程或远程记忆源。

Result: 模型在复杂或长尾任务中更依赖记忆，局部记忆是主要错误来源（占67%错误标记）。

Conclusion: STIM能有效诊断和改进模型推理，适用于其他结构化逐步生成任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well on reasoning benchmarks but often
fail when inputs alter slightly, raising concerns about the extent to which
their success relies on memorization. This issue is especially acute in
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, where spurious memorized patterns can trigger
intermediate errors that cascade into incorrect final answers. We introduce
STIM, a novel framework for Source-aware Token-level Identification of
Memorization, which attributes each token in a reasoning chain to one of
multiple memorization sources - local, mid-range, or long-range - based on
their statistical co-occurrence with the token in the pretraining corpus. Our
token-level analysis across tasks and distributional settings reveals that
models rely more on memorization in complex or long-tail cases, and that local
memorization is often the dominant driver of errors, leading to up to 67% of
wrong tokens. We also show that memorization scores from STIM can be effective
in predicting the wrong tokens in the wrong reasoning step. STIM offers a
powerful tool for diagnosing and improving model reasoning and can generalize
to other structured step-wise generation tasks.

Our approach introduces an effective speaker-emotion disentanglement mechanism
with in-batch contrastive learning, enabling independent manipulation of

embedding integration method for smooth emotion control. To support
comprehensive training and evaluation, we construct CSEMOTIONS, a high-quality

professional speakers across seven emotional categories. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our system, Marco-Voice, achieves substantial improvements in
both objective and subjective metrics. Comprehensive evaluations and analysis
were conducted, results show that MarcoVoice delivers competitive performance
in terms of speech clarity and emotional richness, representing a substantial
advance in the field of expressive neural speech synthesis.

Conclusion: TDBench为时间敏感问答评估提供了一种更可靠和全面的方法，适用于特定应用数据和多跳问题生成。

Abstract: Facts evolve over time, making it essential for Large Language Models (LLMs)
to handle time-sensitive factual knowledge accurately and reliably. While
factual Time-Sensitive Question-Answering (TSQA) tasks have been widely
studied, existing benchmarks often rely on manual curation or a small, fixed
set of predefined templates, which restricts scalable and comprehensive TSQA
evaluation. To address these challenges, we propose TDBench, a new benchmark
that systematically constructs TSQA pairs by harnessing temporal databases and
database techniques such as temporal SQL and functional dependencies. We also
introduce a fine-grained evaluation metric called time accuracy, which assesses
the validity of time references in model explanations alongside traditional
answer accuracy to enable a more reliable TSQA evaluation. Extensive
experiments on contemporary LLMs show how \ours{} enables scalable and
comprehensive TSQA evaluation while reducing the reliance on human labor,
complementing existing Wikipedia/Wikidata-based TSQA evaluation approaches by
enabling LLM evaluation on application-specific data and seamless multi-hop
question generation. Code and data are publicly available at:

TL;DR: ProCut是一种无需训练的LLM无关框架，通过归因分析压缩提示模板，显著减少提示大小，同时保持或提升任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模工业LLM系统中，提示模板膨胀导致维护困难、推理延迟和成本增加，需高效压缩方法。

Method: ProCut将提示模板分段为语义单元，量化其对任务性能的影响，并剪枝低效部分。

Result: 实验显示，ProCut减少78%的提示大小，性能保持或提升（优于其他方法62%），压缩延迟降低50%。

Conclusion: ProCut能无缝集成现有提示优化框架，生成简洁高效的提示。

Abstract: In large-scale industrial LLM systems, prompt templates often expand to
thousands of tokens as teams iteratively incorporate sections such as task
instructions, few-shot examples, and heuristic rules to enhance robustness and
coverage. This expansion leads to bloated prompts that are difficult to
maintain and incur significant inference latency and serving costs. To address
this, we introduce Prompt Compression via Attribution Estimation (ProCut), a
flexible, LLM-agnostic, training-free framework that compresses prompts through
attribution analysis. ProCut segments prompt templates into semantically
meaningful units, quantifies their impact on task performance, and prunes
low-utility components. Through extensive experiments on five public benchmark
datasets and real-world industrial prompts, we show that ProCut achieves
substantial prompt size reductions (78% fewer tokens in production) while
maintaining or even slightly improving task performance (up to 62% better than
alternative methods). We further introduce an LLM-driven attribution estimator
that reduces compression latency by over 50%, and demonstrate that ProCut
integrates seamlessly with existing prompt-optimization frameworks to produce
concise, high-performing prompts.

Method: 引入Synthetic Media Literacy Test（SMeL Test），测试语言模型在上下文中过滤不可信信息的能力，并对多种指令调优的LLM进行基准测试。

Result: 没有模型能一致信任更可靠的信息源，推理能力虽与高分相关，但最佳API模型仍有70%的幻觉率，且大型模型未必优于小型模型。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了语言模型在过滤不可信信息方面的局限性，为未来开发新方法提供了方向。

Abstract: The internet is rife with unattributed, deliberately misleading, or otherwise
untrustworthy content. Though large language models (LLMs) are often tasked
with autonomous web browsing, the extent to which they have learned the simple
heuristics human researchers use to navigate this noisy environment is not
currently known. In this paper, we introduce the Synthetic Media Literacy Test
(SMeL Test), a minimal benchmark that tests the ability of language models to
actively filter out untrustworthy information in context. We benchmark a
variety of commonly used instruction-tuned LLMs, including reasoning models,
and find that no model consistently trusts more reliable sources; while
reasoning in particular is associated with higher scores, even the best API
model we test hallucinates up to 70% of the time. Remarkably, larger and more
capable models do not necessarily outperform their smaller counterparts. We
hope our work sheds more light on this important form of hallucination and
guides the development of new methods to combat it.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit sycophantic behavior, agreeing
with user-stated opinions even when those contradict factual knowledge. While
prior work has documented this tendency, the internal mechanisms that enable
such behavior remain poorly understood. In this paper, we provide a mechanistic
account of how sycophancy arises within LLMs. We first systematically study how
user opinions induce sycophancy across different model families. We find that
simple opinion statements reliably induce sycophancy, whereas user expertise
framing has a negligible impact. Through logit-lens analysis and causal
activation patching, we identify a two-stage emergence of sycophancy: (1) a
late-layer output preference shift and (2) deeper representational divergence.
We also verify that user authority fails to influence behavior because models
do not encode it internally. In addition, we examine how grammatical
perspective affects sycophantic behavior, finding that first-person prompts
(``I believe...'') consistently induce higher sycophancy rates than
third-person framings (``They believe...'') by creating stronger
representational perturbations in deeper layers. These findings highlight that
sycophancy is not a surface-level artifact but emerges from a structural
override of learned knowledge in deeper layers, with implications for alignment
and truthful AI systems.

Motivation: 青少年对毒性内容的理解与成人不同，但现有研究忽略了青少年独特的毒性语言，即成人认为无害但青少年认为有害的内容。

Method: 以中国青少年为研究对象，构建首个中文“青少年毒性”数据集，并分析其特征及现有检测技术的准确性。

Result: 青少年对毒性语言的感知与上下文因素相关，结合这些因素可显著提升检测准确性。

Conclusion: 研究为未来青少年为中心的毒性检测提供了新见解。

Abstract: Risk perception is subjective, and youth's understanding of toxic content
differs from that of adults. Although previous research has conducted extensive
studies on toxicity detection in social media, the investigation of youth's
unique toxicity, i.e., languages perceived as nontoxic by adults but toxic as
youth, is ignored. To address this gap, we aim to explore: 1) What are the
features of ``youth-toxicity'' languages in social media (RQ1); 2) Can existing
toxicity detection techniques accurately detect these languages (RQ2). For
these questions, we took Chinese youth as the research target, constructed the
first Chinese ``youth-toxicity'' dataset, and then conducted extensive
analysis. Our results suggest that youth's perception of these is associated
with several contextual factors, like the source of an utterance and
text-related features. Incorporating these meta information into current
toxicity detection methods significantly improves accuracy overall. Finally, we
propose several insights into future research on youth-centered toxicity
detection.

*David Demitri Africa,Yuval Weiss,Paula Buttery,Richard Diehl Martinez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过元学习优化小型语言模型的预训练，使其更快、性能更好且更易解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索元学习是否能提升小型语言模型的预训练效率和可解释性。

Method: 结合一阶MAML和子集掩码语言模型预训练，构建四个LLama风格解码器模型（11M-570M参数）。

Result: 模型在相同计算下更快达到目标损失（1.6倍速度），多语言通用NER任务F1提升，训练动态更易解读。

Conclusion: 元学习显著提升小型语言模型的效率和可解释性，训练动态呈现两阶段特征（多样化和压缩）。

Abstract: Large language models are powerful but costly. We ask whether meta-learning
can make the pretraining of small language models not only better but also more
interpretable. We integrate first-order MAML with subset-masked LM pretraining,
producing four LLama-style decoder-only models (11M-570M params), and evaluate
it on a fundamental NLP task with many settings and real-world applications.
Compared with vanilla training, our model (i) reaches the same loss up to 1.6x
sooner, (ii) improves F1 on multilingual Universal NER under equal compute, and
(iii) makes the training dynamics easy to read: first the network's
representations fan out ("diversify") and later they collapse into a smaller,
shared subspace ("compress"). This two-stage shift shows up as a rise-and-fall
in both effective-rank curves and attention-head entropy. The same curves
pinpoint which layers specialise earliest and which later reconverge, giving a
compact, interpretable signature of meta-adaptation. Code, checkpoints and
WandB logs are released.

non-sequential, parallel generation, discrete diffusion models provide a
notable speedup to mitigate the inherent latency of token-by-token decoding, as
demonstrated recently (e.g., Mercury Coder, Gemini Diffusion). Seed Diffusion
Preview achieves an inference speed of 2,146 token/s over H20 GPUs while
maintaining competitive performance across a sweep of standard code evaluation
benchmarks, significantly faster than contemporary Mercury and Gemini
Diffusion, establishing new state of the art on the speed-quality Pareto

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proof2Hybrid是一个自动化框架，用于生成高质量的证明中心基准测试，以评估大型语言模型（LLMs）的数学能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试无法全面评估LLMs的数学能力，尤其是证明中心问题，手动创建成本高且不可扩展。

Method: 提出Proof2X路线图，将数学证明转化为易于验证的问题，并设计了一种新型混合格式问题（“m-out-of-n多法官问题”）。

Result: 通过AlgGeoTest基准测试发现，当前最先进的LLMs在代数几何领域的理解存在显著缺陷。

Conclusion: Proof2Hybrid框架和AlgGeoTest为深入研究AI系统的数学智能提供了新方向。

Abstract: Evaluating the mathematical capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a
critical yet challenging frontier. Existing benchmarks fall short, particularly
for proof-centric problems, as manual creation is unscalable and costly,
leaving the true mathematical abilities of LLMs largely unassessed. To overcome
these barriers, we propose Proof2Hybrid, the first fully automated framework
that synthesizes high-quality, proof-centric benchmarks from natural language
mathematical corpora. The key novelty of our solution is Proof2X, a roadmap of
converting mathematical proofs into various kinds of questions that are easy to
verify. Instructed by this roadmap, we propose a new type of hybrid-formatted
questions, named ``$m$-out-of-$n$ multiple judge questions'', specifically
designed to enable robust, automatic evaluation while being resilient to
guessing and superficial pattern matching inherent in traditional formats. As a
demonstration of our framework, we introduce AlgGeoTest, a benchmark for
algebraic geometry--a frontier domain of modern mathematics--comprising 456
challenging items. Our extensive evaluations on state-of-the-art LLMs using
AlgGeoTest reveal profound deficits in their comprehension of algebraic
geometry, providing a more precise measure of their true mathematical
capabilities. Our framework and benchmark pave the way for a new wave of
in-depth research into the mathematical intelligence of AI systems.

TL;DR: 该研究通过扩展语言特定神经元定位方法，识别并分离了多语言大模型中文化特定神经元，发现文化信息主要编码在模型上层，且可独立调节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多语言大模型中文化信息的编码方式及其与语言神经元的交互，以促进公平性和包容性。

Method: 扩展语言神经元定位方法，引入MUREL数据集（8520万标记，覆盖六种文化），进行神经元定位和干预实验。

Result: 发现文化信息由特定神经元编码（主要在上层），可独立于语言或其他文化神经元调节。

Conclusion: 文化知识可选择性编辑，有助于提升模型公平性和对齐性。

Abstract: Language and culture are deeply intertwined, yet it is so far unclear how and
where multilingual large language models encode culture. Here, we extend upon
an established methodology for identifying language-specific neurons and extend
it to localize and isolate culture-specific neurons, carefully disentangling
their overlap and interaction with language-specific neurons. To facilitate our
experiments, we introduce MUREL, a curated dataset of 85.2 million tokens
spanning six different cultures. Our localization and intervention experiments
show that LLMs encode different cultures in distinct neuron populations,
predominantly in upper layers, and that these culture neurons can be modulated
independently from language-specific neurons or those specific to other
cultures. These findings suggest that cultural knowledge and propensities in
multilingual language models can be selectively isolated and edited - promoting
fairness, inclusivity, and alignment. Code and data is available at

Motivation: 量化跨语言干扰，帮助设计更优的多语言模型。

Method: 构建干扰矩阵，训练小型BERT模型评估所有语言对。

Result: 干扰不对称，与脚本相关而非语言家族或嵌入相似性。

Conclusion: 干扰矩阵是优化多语言模型性能的有效工具。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of language interference in
encoder-only Transformer models across 83 languages. We construct an
interference matrix by training and evaluating small BERT-like models on all
possible language pairs, providing a large-scale quantification of
cross-lingual interference. Our analysis reveals that interference between
languages is asymmetrical and that its patterns do not align with traditional
linguistic characteristics, such as language family, nor with proxies like
embedding similarity, but instead better relate to script. Finally, we
demonstrate that the interference matrix effectively predicts performance on
downstream tasks, serving as a tool to better design multilingual models to
obtain optimal performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解RLVR中熵与性能交换的机制，以优化大型语言模型的推理能力。

Method: 将训练过程分为上升阶段和平稳阶段，分析不同粒度下的熵动态，提出基于困惑度和位置信息的动态奖励调整方法。

Result: 上升阶段中负样本的熵减少有助于学习有效推理模式；平稳阶段中高熵令牌与学习效率强相关。提出的方法在多种LLMs上优于基线。

Conclusion: 动态调整奖励信号可显著提升RLVR的性能，为优化LLM推理能力提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recently, reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been
widely used for enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs). A core challenge in RLVR involves managing the exchange between entropy
and performance of policies. Despite the importance of this exchange, a
fine-grained understanding of when and how this exchange operates most
effectively remains limited. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic
empirical analysis of the entropy-performance exchange mechanism of RLVR across
different levels of granularity. Specifically, we first divide the training
process into two distinct stages based on entropy dynamics, i.e., rising stage
and plateau stage, and then systematically investigate how this mechanism
varies across stage-level, instance-level, and token-level granularitiess. Our
analysis reveals that, in the rising stage, entropy reduction in negative
samples facilitates the learning of effective reasoning patterns, which in turn
drives rapid performance gains. Moreover, in the plateau stage, learning
efficiency strongly correlates with high-entropy tokens present in
low-perplexity samples and those located at the end of sequences. Motivated by
these findings, we propose two methods that dynamically adjust the reward
signal using perplexity and positional information to focus RL updates on
tokens that exhibit high learning potential, achieving improvements compared to
the baseline methods on various LLMs.

TL;DR: SHAMI-MT是一个双向机器翻译系统，旨在弥合现代标准阿拉伯语（MSA）与叙利亚方言之间的沟通差距。基于AraT5v2-base-1024架构，模型在Nabra数据集上微调，并在MADAR语料库上评估，表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯世界的语言景观中存在现代标准阿拉伯语与方言之间的显著差异，这对自然语言处理（尤其是机器翻译）提出了挑战。

Method: 开发了两个专用模型（MSA-to-Shami和Shami-to-MSA），基于AraT5v2-base-1024架构，并在Nabra数据集上微调。

Result: MSA-to-Shami模型在GPT-4.1评估中获得了4.01/5.0的高分，表明其翻译准确且方言地道。

Conclusion: SHAMI-MT为阿拉伯方言翻译提供了高保真工具，对内容本地化、文化遗产和跨文化交流有重要应用。

Abstract: The rich linguistic landscape of the Arab world is characterized by a
significant gap between Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), the language of formal
communication, and the diverse regional dialects used in everyday life. This
diglossia presents a formidable challenge for natural language processing,
particularly machine translation. This paper introduces \textbf{SHAMI-MT}, a
bidirectional machine translation system specifically engineered to bridge the
communication gap between MSA and the Syrian dialect. We present two
specialized models, one for MSA-to-Shami and another for Shami-to-MSA
translation, both built upon the state-of-the-art AraT5v2-base-1024
architecture. The models were fine-tuned on the comprehensive Nabra dataset and
rigorously evaluated on unseen data from the MADAR corpus. Our MSA-to-Shami
model achieved an outstanding average quality score of \textbf{4.01 out of 5.0}
when judged by OPENAI model GPT-4.1, demonstrating its ability to produce
translations that are not only accurate but also dialectally authentic. This
work provides a crucial, high-fidelity tool for a previously underserved
language pair, advancing the field of dialectal Arabic translation and offering
significant applications in content localization, cultural heritage, and
intercultural communication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大规模数据集存在许可模糊、静态发布和质量保证受限等问题，限制了其使用和长期发展。

Method: 提出Dynaword框架，支持社区协作持续更新数据集，并通过Danish Dynaword实现验证。

Result: Danish Dynaword规模远超同类数据集，完全开放许可，并成功吸引多方贡献。

Conclusion: Dynaword框架为数据集提供了可持续的社区协作和更新机制，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Large-scale datasets are foundational for research and development in natural
language processing. However, current approaches face three key challenges: (1)
reliance on ambiguously licensed sources restricting use, sharing, and
derivative works; (2) static dataset releases that prevent community
contributions and diminish longevity; and (3) quality assurance processes
restricted to publishing teams rather than leveraging community expertise.
  To address these limitations, we introduce two contributions: the Dynaword
approach and Danish Dynaword. The Dynaword approach is a framework for creating
large-scale, open datasets that can be continuously updated through community
collaboration. Danish Dynaword is a concrete implementation that validates this
approach and demonstrates its potential. Danish Dynaword contains over four
times as many tokens as comparable releases, is exclusively openly licensed,
and has received multiple contributions across industry and research. The
repository includes light-weight tests to ensure data formatting, quality, and
documentation, establishing a sustainable framework for ongoing community
contributions and dataset evolution.

Motivation: 在安全关键应用中，确保RAG系统的安全性和领域内响应至关重要，但现有方法仍面临挑战。

Method: 评估了四种OOD查询检测方法，并探索了PCA和神经崩溃特征分离的两种新策略。

Result: 在标准数据集和实际应用中验证了方法的有效性，确认外部OOD检测器对保持响应相关性至关重要。

Conclusion: 外部OOD检测器是确保RAG系统响应相关性和安全性的关键。

Abstract: Ensuring safety and in-domain responses for Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems is paramount in safety-critical applications, yet remains a
significant challenge. To address this, we evaluate four methodologies for
Out-Of-Domain (OOD) query detection: GPT-4o, regression-based, Principal
Component Analysis (PCA)-based, and Neural Collapse (NC), to ensure the RAG
system only responds to queries confined to the system's knowledge base.
Specifically, our evaluation explores two novel dimensionality reduction and
feature separation strategies: \textit{PCA}, where top components are selected
using explained variance or OOD separability, and an adaptation of
\textit{Neural Collapse Feature Separation}. We validate our approach on
standard datasets (StackExchange and MSMARCO) and real-world applications
(Substance Use and COVID-19), including tests against LLM-simulated and actual
attacks on a COVID-19 vaccine chatbot. Through human and LLM-based evaluations
of response correctness and relevance, we confirm that an external OOD detector
is crucial for maintaining response relevance.

TL;DR: LaMPE是一种无需训练的方法，通过动态调整位置编码和注意力机制，显著提升大语言模型在长上下文输入中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在输入超过预训练上下文窗口时的性能下降问题，特别是由于RoPE的OOD行为导致的问题。

Method: 提出LaMPE，利用参数化的缩放sigmoid函数动态调整位置编码，并结合多粒度注意力机制优化不同序列区域的位置分辨率。

Result: 在五个主流长上下文基准测试中，LaMPE显著优于现有长度外推方法。

Conclusion: LaMPE是一种高效且通用的方法，适用于多种基于RoPE的大语言模型，无需额外训练即可提升长上下文处理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) experience significant performance degradation
when the input exceeds the pretraining context window, primarily due to the
out-of-distribution (OOD) behavior of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). Recent
studies mitigate this problem by remapping OOD positions into the
in-distribution range with fixed mapping strategies, ignoring the dynamic
relationship between input length and the model's effective context window. To
this end, we propose Length-aware Multi-grained Positional Encoding (LaMPE), a
training-free method that fully utilizes the model's effective context window
for adaptive long-context scaling in LLMs. Motivated by the left-skewed
frequency distribution of relative positions, LaMPE establishes a dynamic
relationship between mapping length and input length through a parametric
scaled sigmoid function to adaptively allocate positional capacity across
varying input lengths. Meanwhile, LaMPE devises a novel multi-grained attention
mechanism that strategically allocates positional resolution across different
sequence regions to capture both fine-grained locality and long-range
dependencies. Our method can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of
RoPE-based LLMs without training. Extensive experiments on three representative
LLMs across five mainstream long-context benchmarks demonstrate that LaMPE
achieves significant performance improvements compared to existing length
extrapolation methods. The code will be released at
https://github.com/scar-on/LaMPE.

Conclusion: VeOmni展示了高效和可扩展的全模态大语言模型训练能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven impressive
progress in omni-modal understanding and generation. However, training
omni-modal LLMs remains a significant challenge due to the heterogeneous model
architectures required to process diverse modalities, necessitating
sophisticated system design for efficient large-scale training. Existing
frameworks typically entangle model definition with parallel logic, incurring
limited scalability and substantial engineering overhead for end-to-end
omni-modal training. % We present \veomni, a modular and efficient training
framework to accelerate the development of omni-modal LLMs. \veomni introduces
model-centric distributed recipes that decouples communication from
computation, enabling efficient 3D parallelism on omni-modal LLMs. \veomni also
features a flexible configuration interface supporting seamless integration of
new modalities with minimal code change. % Using \veomni, a omni-modal
mixture-of-experts (MoE) model with 30B parameters can be trained with over
2,800 tokens/sec/GPU throughput and scale to 160K context lengths via 3D
parallelism on 128 GPUs, showcasing its superior efficiency and scalability for

Motivation: MoE模型虽性能强大，但参数增长带来的计算和存储开销不成比例，现有方法在性能和效率上仍有不足。

Method: 将MoE层视为微专家混合物，提出CAMERA框架（训练免费）识别冗余，并开发CAMERA-P（剪枝）和CAMERA-Q（量化）。

Result: CAMERA-P在20%-60%剪枝率下优于基线，CAMERA-Q在2-bit量化下表现更优，且分析Qwen2-57B-A14B仅需5分钟。

Conclusion: CAMERA框架高效压缩MoE模型，显著提升计算效率，同时保持性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are
distinguished by their strong performance scaling with increasing parameters
across a wide range of tasks, yet they also suffer from substantial
computational and storage overheads. Notably, the performance gains of MoE
models do not scale proportionally with the growth in expert parameters. While
prior works attempt to reduce parameters via expert-level pruning, merging, or
decomposition, they still suffer from challenges in both performance and
computational efficiency. In this paper, we address these challenges by
introducing micro-expert as a finer-grained compression unit that spans across
matrices. We first establish a more fundamental perspective, viewing MoE layers
as mixtures of micro-experts, and present CAMERA, a lightweight and
training-free framework for identifying micro-expert redundancy. Our analysis
uncovers significant variance in micro-expert contributions during decoding.
Based on this insight, we further propose CAMERA-P, a structured micro-expert
pruning framework, and CAMERA-Q, a mixed-precision quantization idea designed
for micro-experts. Extensive experiments on nine downstream tasks show that
CAMERA-P consistently outperforms strong baselines under pruning ratios ranging
from 20% to 60%. Furthermore, CAMERA-Q achieves superior results under
aggressive 2-bit quantization, surpassing existing matrix- and channel-level
ideas. Notably, our method enables complete micro-expert analysis of
Qwen2-57B-A14B in less than 5 minutes on a single NVIDIA A100-40GB GPU.

Method: 提出PNLAC定位政治神经元（通用和特定话题神经元），并开发InhibitFT抑制方法。

Result: 实验证明PNLAC和InhibitFT有效，后者平均减少20%跨话题泛化，且仅需抑制5%神经元。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了政治神经元的机制，并提出有效抑制方法，为减少立场泛化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models on a political topic will significantly
manipulate their political stance on various issues and unintentionally affect
their stance on unrelated topics. While previous studies have proposed this
issue, there is still a lack of understanding regarding the internal
representations of these stances and the mechanisms that lead to unintended
cross-topic generalization. In this paper, we systematically explore the
internal mechanisms underlying this phenomenon from a neuron-level perspective
and how to mitigate the cross-topic generalization of political fine-tuning.
Firstly, we propose Political Neuron Localization through Activation
Contrasting (PNLAC) to identify two distinct types of political neurons:
general political neurons, which govern stance across multiple political
topics, and topic-specific neurons} that affect the model's political stance on
individual topics. We find the existence of these political neuron types across
four models and datasets through activation patching experiments. Leveraging
these insights, we introduce InhibitFT, an inhibition-based fine-tuning method,
effectively mitigating the cross-topic stance generalization. Experimental
results demonstrate the robustness of identified neuron types across various
models and datasets, and show that InhibitFT significantly reduces the
cross-topic stance generalization by 20% on average, while preserving
topic-specific performance. Moreover, we demonstrate that selectively
inhibiting only 5% of neurons is sufficient to effectively mitigate the
cross-topic stance generalization.

Result: 在LongBench和Needle-in-a-Haystack基准测试中，CompressKV在不同内存预算下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CompressKV通过优化注意力头选择和层自适应分配，有效提升了长上下文处理的效率和性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly boosted
long-context processing. However, the increasing key-value (KV) cache size
poses critical challenges to memory and execution efficiency. Most KV cache
compression methods rely on heuristic token eviction using all attention heads
in Grouped Query Attention (GQA)-based LLMs. This method ignores the different
functionalities of attention heads, leading to the eviction of critical tokens
and thus degrades the performance of LLMs.
  To address the issue above, instead of using all the attention heads in
GQA-based LLMs to determine important tokens as in the previous work, we first
identify the attention heads in each layer that are not only capable of
retrieving the initial and final tokens of a prompt, but also capable of
retrieving important tokens within the text and attending to their surrounding
semantic context. Afterwards, we exploit such heads to determine the important
tokens and retain their corresponding KV cache pairs. Furthermore, we analyze
the cache eviction error of each layer individually and introduce a
layer-adaptive KV cache allocation strategy. Experimental results demonstrate
the proposed CompressKV consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
under various memory budgets on LongBench and Needle-in-a-Haystack benchmarks.

Motivation: 传统知识图谱嵌入（KGE）模型仅适用于静态知识图谱，而动态知识图谱的持续演化导致模型容易遗忘先前学到的知识，因此需要新的CKGE方法。

Method: BAKE采用贝叶斯后验更新原则作为持续学习策略，将每批新数据视为模型先验的贝叶斯更新，并通过连续聚类方法约束新旧知识之间的演化差异。

Result: 实验结果表明，BAKE在多个数据集上显著优于现有基线模型。

Conclusion: BAKE通过贝叶斯框架和连续聚类方法，有效解决了CKGE中的知识遗忘问题，为动态知识图谱嵌入提供了新思路。

Abstract: Since knowledge graphs (KG) will continue to evolve in real scenarios,
traditional KGE models are only suitable for static knowledge graphs.
Therefore, continual knowledge graph embedding (CKGE) has attracted the
attention of researchers. Currently, a key challenge facing CKGE is that the
model is prone to "catastrophic forgetting", resulting in the loss of
previously learned knowledge. In order to effectively alleviate this problem,
we propose a new CKGE model BAKE. First, we note that the Bayesian posterior
update principle provides a natural continual learning strategy that is
insensitive to data order and can theoretically effectively resist the
forgetting of previous knowledge during data evolution. Different from the
existing CKGE method, BAKE regards each batch of new data as a Bayesian update
of the model prior. Under this framework, as long as the posterior distribution
of the model is maintained, the model can better preserve the knowledge of
early snapshots even after evolving through multiple time snapshots. Secondly,
we propose a continual clustering method for CKGE, which further directly
combats knowledge forgetting by constraining the evolution difference (or
change amplitude) between new and old knowledge between different snapshots. We
conduct extensive experiments on BAKE on multiple datasets, and the results
show that BAKE significantly outperforms existing baseline models.

### [306] [AI-Based Measurement of Innovation: Mapping Expert Insight into Large Language Model Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02430)
*Robin Nowak,Patrick Figge,Carolin Haeussler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用大型语言模型（LLMs）测量创新的框架，替代传统依赖专家评估的方法，并在两个不同场景中验证了其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统创新测量依赖专家评估和特定上下文代理，限制了研究的广泛性。本文旨在利用LLMs克服这些限制，提供更通用的创新测量工具。

Method: 设计了一个LLM框架，通过非结构化文本数据近似专家评估，并在软件更新和用户生成反馈两个场景中测试其性能。

Result: LLM框架在F1分数和一致性方面优于其他方法（包括传统机器学习和深度学习模型）。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究人员和从业人员提供了可靠、通用的创新测量工具，并讨论了关键设计决策对性能的影响。

Abstract: Measuring innovation often relies on context-specific proxies and on expert
evaluation. Hence, empirical innovation research is often limited to settings
where such data is available. We investigate how large language models (LLMs)
can be leveraged to overcome the constraints of manual expert evaluations and
assist researchers in measuring innovation. We design an LLM framework that
reliably approximates domain experts' assessment of innovation from
unstructured text data. We demonstrate the performance and broad applicability
of this framework through two studies in different contexts: (1) the
innovativeness of software application updates and (2) the originality of
user-generated feedback and improvement ideas in product reviews. We compared
the performance (F1-score) and reliability (consistency rate) of our LLM
framework against alternative measures used in prior innovation studies, and to
state-of-the-art machine learning- and deep learning-based models. The LLM
framework achieved higher F1-scores than the other approaches, and its results
are highly consistent (i.e., results do not change across runs). This article
equips R&D personnel in firms, as well as researchers, reviewers, and editors,
with the knowledge and tools to effectively use LLMs for measuring innovation
and evaluating the performance of LLM-based innovation measures. In doing so,
we discuss, the impact of important design decisions-including model selection,
prompt engineering, training data size, training data distribution, and
parameter settings-on performance and reliability. Given the challenges
inherent in using human expert evaluation and existing text-based measures, our
framework has important implications for harnessing LLMs as reliable,
increasingly accessible, and broadly applicable research tools for measuring
innovation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示优化技术多依赖启发式或手动探索，缺乏自动化方法。

Method: 利用潜在语义空间嵌入种子提示，系统探索空间以优化任务性能。

Result: 在Financial PhraseBank情感分类任务中，单次优化周期提升准确率约3%。

Conclusion: LatentPrompt框架通用性强，仅需黑盒LLM访问和自动评估指标，适用于多领域任务。

Abstract: Recent advances have shown that optimizing prompts for Large Language Models
(LLMs) can significantly improve task performance, yet many optimization
techniques rely on heuristics or manual exploration. We present LatentPrompt, a
model-agnostic framework for prompt optimization that leverages latent semantic
space to automatically generate, evaluate, and refine candidate prompts without
requiring hand-crafted rules. Beginning with a set of seed prompts, our method
embeds them in a continuous latent space and systematically explores this space
to identify prompts that maximize task-specific performance. In a
proof-of-concept study on the Financial PhraseBank sentiment classification
benchmark, LatentPrompt increased classification accuracy by approximately 3
percent after a single optimization cycle. The framework is broadly applicable,
requiring only black-box access to an LLM and an automatic evaluation metric,
making it suitable for diverse domains and tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究社交媒体在政治抗议中如何成为抵抗和身份构建的核心工具。

Method: 采用定性方法分析视觉修辞、言语话语和数字讽刺。

Result: Facebook上的视觉与言语策略成功动员公众情绪并构建集体身份，挑战威权叙事。

Conclusion: 在线平台在数字时代可作为身份构建和政治动员的强大工具。

Abstract: This study investigates how Facebook shaped collective identity during the
July 2024 pro-democracy uprising in Bangladesh, known as the Monsoon Uprising.
During government repression, protesters turned to Facebook as a central space
for resistance, where multimodal expressions, images, memes, videos, hashtags,
and satirical posts played an important role in unifying participants. Using a
qualitative approach, this research analyzes visual rhetoric, verbal discourse,
and digital irony to reveal how shared symbols, protest art, and slogans built
a sense of solidarity. Key elements included the symbolic use of red, the
ironic metaphorical use of the term "Razakar", and the widespread sharing of
visuals representing courage, injustice, and resistance. The findings show that
the combination of visual and verbal strategies on Facebook not only mobilized
public sentiment, but also built a strong collective identity that challenged
authoritarian narratives. This study tries to demonstrate how online platforms
can serve as powerful tools for identity construction and political
mobilization in the digital age.

Motivation: 探究LLMs是否及如何在不同语言身份下表现出类似人类的心理语言学反应。

Method: 评估Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct和Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct在英语、荷兰语和中文的单语及双语提示下的表现，分析声音象征和词价任务。

Result: 模型输出受语言身份影响，Qwen对荷兰语和中文的区分更敏感；深层网络中心理语言学信号更易解码，中文提示的效价表征更稳定。

Conclusion: 语言身份影响LLMs的输出行为和内部表征，为跨语言认知模型的应用提供新见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong linguistic capabilities, but
little is known about how they encode psycholinguistic knowledge across
languages. We investigate whether and how LLMs exhibit human-like
psycholinguistic responses under different linguistic identities using two
tasks: sound symbolism and word valence. We evaluate two models,
Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, under monolingual and
bilingual prompting in English, Dutch, and Chinese. Behaviorally, both models
adjust their outputs based on prompted language identity, with Qwen showing
greater sensitivity and sharper distinctions between Dutch and Chinese. Probing
analysis reveals that psycholinguistic signals become more decodable in deeper
layers, with Chinese prompts yielding stronger and more stable valence
representations than Dutch. Our results demonstrate that language identity
conditions both output behavior and internal representations in LLMs, providing
new insights into their application as models of cross-linguistic cognition.

<details>

Motivation: 目前对LLMs内部机制的理解尚不统一，尤其是它们在算术任务中的表现。本文旨在揭示其背后的具体机制。

Method: 通过特征重要性和因果干预方法，识别并验证了数字位特定的电路机制。

Result: 研究发现这些电路独立于模型大小和分词策略，且干预实验表明这些电路对算术任务的解决具有因果作用。

Conclusion: LLMs在解决算术问题时具有可解释的组合结构，为理解其内部机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: While recent work has begun to uncover the internal strategies that Large
Language Models (LLMs) employ for simple arithmetic tasks, a unified
understanding of their underlying mechanisms is still lacking. We extend recent
findings showing that LLMs represent numbers in a digit-wise manner and present
evidence for the existence of digit-position-specific circuits that LLMs use to
perform simple arithmetic tasks, i.e. modular subgroups of MLP neurons that
operate independently on different digit positions (units, tens, hundreds).
Notably, such circuits exist independently of model size and of tokenization
strategy, i.e. both for models that encode longer numbers digit-by-digit and as
one token. Using Feature Importance and Causal Interventions, we identify and
validate the digit-position-specific circuits, revealing a compositional and
interpretable structure underlying the solving of arithmetic problems in LLMs.
Our interventions selectively alter the model's prediction at targeted digit
positions, demonstrating the causal role of digit-position circuits in solving
arithmetic tasks.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在生成具有严格结构、音调和韵律约束的古典诗词（宋词）时的能力，填补文化相关文本生成的研究空白。

Method: 开发多维度评估框架（形式符合度、自动质量评估、人工评估、分类任务），评估18种LLMs在五种提示策略下的表现，并提出Generate-Critic架构优化模型。

Result: 通过监督微调（SFT）优化轻量级开源LLMs，形式符合度提升最高达5.88%。

Conclusion: 揭示了LLMs在生成文化意义重大且形式约束严格的文本时的优势与局限，为相关研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic investigation into the constrained
generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in producing Songci, a
classical Chinese poetry form characterized by strict structural, tonal, and
rhyme constraints defined by Cipai templates. We first develop a comprehensive,
multi-faceted evaluation framework that includes: (i) a formal conformity
score, (ii) automated quality assessment using LLMs, (iii) human evaluation,
and (iv) classification-based probing tasks. Using this framework, we evaluate
the generative performance of 18 LLMs, including 3 proprietary models and 15
open-source models across four families, under five prompting strategies:
zero-shot, one-shot, completion-based, instruction-tuned, and chain-of-thought.
Finally, we propose a Generate-Critic architecture in which the evaluation
framework functions as an automated critic. Leveraging the critic's feedback as
a reward signal, we fine-tune three lightweight open-source LLMs via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT), resulting in improvements of up to 5.88% in formal
conformity. Our findings offer new insights into the generative strengths and
limitations of LLMs in producing culturally significant and formally
constrained literary texts.

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型如何在无语音或听觉基础的情况下完成语音任务，探索其内部音素表示方式。

Method: 分析Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct模型的潜在空间，识别其音素表示的高层组织，并发现一个促进语音信息的“音素移动头”。

Result: 模型学习到了类似人类IPA元音图的音素表示，尽管未接受直接监督。

Conclusion: Llama模型通过内部隐含的音素模型完成语音任务，展现了无监督学习的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate proficiency on phonetic tasks, such as
rhyming, without explicit phonetic or auditory grounding. In this work, we
investigate how \verb|Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct| represents token-level phonetic
information. Our results suggest that Llama uses a rich internal model of
phonemes to complete phonetic tasks. We provide evidence for high-level
organization of phoneme representations in its latent space. In doing so, we
also identify a ``phoneme mover head" which promotes phonetic information
during rhyming tasks. We visualize the output space of this head and find that,
while notable differences exist, Llama learns a model of vowels similar to the
standard IPA vowel chart for humans, despite receiving no direct supervision to
do so.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用Transformer模型在处理技术文档的细粒度语法和实体关系时表现不佳，需要更专业的解决方案。

Method: CGT通过动态图构建输入标记的局部结构，结合GNN和Transformer捕获全局依赖，采用两阶段训练。

Result: CGT在准确率上比GPT-2高24.7%，且参数减少62.4%。

Conclusion: CGT为技术领域提供了高效且适应性强的解决方案，显著提升了问答性能。

Abstract: Standard transformer-based language models, while powerful for general text,
often struggle with the fine-grained syntax and entity relationships in complex
technical, engineering documents. To address this, we propose the Contextual
Graph Transformer (CGT), a hybrid neural architecture that combines Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers for domain-specific question answering.
CGT constructs a dynamic graph over input tokens using sequential, skip-gram,
and semantic similarity edges, which is processed by GATv2Conv layers for local
structure learning. These enriched embeddings are then passed to a Transformer
encoder to capture global dependencies. Unlike generic large models, technical
domains often require specialized language models with stronger
contextualization and structure awareness. CGT offers a parameter-efficient
solution for such use cases. Integrated into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) pipeline, CGT outperforms baselines like GPT-2 and BERT, achieving 24.7%
higher accuracy than GPT-2 with 62.4% fewer parameters. This gain stems from
CGTs ability to jointly model structural token interactions and long-range
semantic coherence. The model is trained from scratch using a two-phase
approach: pretraining on general text followed by fine-tuning on
domain-specific manuals. This highlights CGTs adaptability to technical
language, enabling better grounding, entity tracking, and retrieval-augmented
responses in real-world applications.

methodology for automatically identifying bias by commission, omission, and

Motivation: 解决在缺乏平行文本的领域或语言中，多语言自然语言处理的需求，同时通过可比文档了解不同语言对同一话题的表述。

Method: 从维基百科和EURONEWS构建英语、法语和阿拉伯语的可比语料库，实验基于双语词典和LSI的跨语言相似度对齐方法。

Result: CL-LSI在多个语料库上的表现优于词典方法，并能实现话题和事件级别的对齐。

Conclusion: CL-LSI是一种有效的跨语言文档对齐方法，适用于话题和事件级别的对齐任务。

Abstract: Comparable corpus is a set of topic aligned documents in multiple languages,
which are not necessarily translations of each other. These documents are
useful for multilingual natural language processing when there is no parallel
text available in some domains or languages. In addition, comparable documents
are informative because they can tell what is being said about a topic in
different languages. In this paper, we present a method to build comparable
corpora from Wikipedia encyclopedia and EURONEWS website in English, French and
Arabic languages. We further experiment a method to automatically align
comparable documents using cross-lingual similarity measures. We investigate
two cross-lingual similarity measures to align comparable documents. The first
measure is based on bilingual dictionary, and the second measure is based on
Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI). Experiments on several corpora show that the
Cross-Lingual LSI (CL-LSI) measure outperforms the dictionary based measure.
Finally, we collect English and Arabic news documents from the British
Broadcast Corporation (BBC) and from ALJAZEERA (JSC) news website respectively.
Then we use the CL-LSI similarity measure to automatically align comparable
documents of BBC and JSC. The evaluation of the alignment shows that CL-LSI is
not only able to align cross-lingual documents at the topic level, but also it
is able to do this at the event level.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床文本的标准化医学概念标注对结构化数据提取和决策支持至关重要，但手动标注成本高且难以扩展。

Method: 使用双向GRU模型，结合MIMIC-IV数据集，通过SpaCy和SciBERT预处理文本，并利用上下文、句法和形态特征进行标注。

Result: 模型在验证集上达到90%的F1分数，优于传统规则系统，且能有效处理歧义和拼写错误。

Conclusion: 轻量级RNN架构能以较低计算成本实现高质量临床概念标注，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Automated annotation of clinical text with standardized medical concepts is
critical for enabling structured data extraction and decision support. SNOMED
CT provides a rich ontology for labeling clinical entities, but manual
annotation is labor-intensive and impractical at scale. This study introduces a
neural sequence labeling approach for SNOMED CT concept recognition using a
Bidirectional GRU model. Leveraging a subset of MIMIC-IV, we preprocess text
with domain-adapted SpaCy and SciBERT-based tokenization, segmenting sentences
into overlapping 19-token chunks enriched with contextual, syntactic, and
morphological features. The Bi-GRU model assigns IOB tags to identify concept
spans and achieves strong performance with a 90 percent F1-score on the
validation set. These results surpass traditional rule-based systems and match
or exceed existing neural models. Qualitative analysis shows effective handling
of ambiguous terms and misspellings. Our findings highlight that lightweight
RNN-based architectures can deliver high-quality clinical concept annotation
with significantly lower computational cost than transformer-based models,
making them well-suited for real-world deployment.

Motivation: dLLMs的二次计算复杂度和内存开销限制了长上下文应用，现有缓存技术内存占用高。

Method: 提出Sparse-dLLM框架，结合动态缓存淘汰和稀疏注意力，利用token显著性稳定性。

Result: 在LLaDA和Dream系列上，吞吐量提升10倍，性能相当，内存成本相近。

Conclusion: Sparse-dLLM在效率和效果上优于现有方法，适用于长上下文任务。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) enable breakthroughs in reasoning and
parallel decoding but suffer from prohibitive quadratic computational
complexity and memory overhead during inference. Current caching techniques
accelerate decoding by storing full-layer states, yet impose substantial memory
usage that limit long-context applications. Our analysis of attention patterns
in dLLMs reveals persistent cross-layer sparsity, with pivotal tokens remaining
salient across decoding steps and low-relevance tokens staying unimportant,
motivating selective cache eviction. We propose Sparse-dLLM, the first
training-free framework integrating dynamic cache eviction with sparse
attention via delayed bidirectional sparse caching. By leveraging the stability
of token saliency over steps, it retains critical tokens and dynamically evicts
unimportant prefix/suffix entries using an attention-guided strategy. Extensive
experiments on LLaDA and Dream series demonstrate Sparse-dLLM achieves up to
10$\times$ higher throughput than vanilla dLLMs, with comparable performance
and similar peak memory costs, outperforming previous methods in efficiency and
effectiveness.

Motivation: 现有分类法无法准确反映注意力机制中的不同记忆形式，需要更精确的分类方法。

Method: 使用CNN训练LLM的注意力权重，评估其与现有分类法的对齐性，并提出新分类法。

Result: 现有分类法表现不佳，新分类法将记忆样本分为三类：语言建模能力猜测的、训练集高重复性导致的记忆样本，以及非记忆样本。

Conclusion: 研究表明，少样本逐字记忆并非独立的注意力机制，且许多可提取样本实际是模型猜测的结果，需单独研究。

Abstract: Verbatim memorization in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a multifaceted
phenomenon involving distinct underlying mechanisms. We introduce a novel
method to analyze the different forms of memorization described by the existing
taxonomy. Specifically, we train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the
attention weights of the LLM and evaluate the alignment between this taxonomy
and the attention weights involved in decoding.
  We find that the existing taxonomy performs poorly and fails to reflect
distinct mechanisms within the attention blocks. We propose a new taxonomy that
maximizes alignment with the attention weights, consisting of three categories:
memorized samples that are guessed using language modeling abilities, memorized
samples that are recalled due to high duplication in the training set, and
non-memorized samples. Our results reveal that few-shot verbatim memorization
does not correspond to a distinct attention mechanism. We also show that a
significant proportion of extractable samples are in fact guessed by the model
and should therefore be studied separately. Finally, we develop a custom visual
interpretability technique to localize the regions of the attention weights
involved in each form of memorization.

Motivation: 阿拉伯语患者反馈因方言多样性和标注稀缺而缺乏自动化分析，EHSAN旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用ChatGPT伪标签与人工审核结合的混合方法，构建数据集，并训练两种Transformer模型进行方面和情感分类。

Result: 阿拉伯语专用模型在少量人工监督下仍表现优异，仅使用ChatGPT标签时性能略有下降。减少方面类别显著提升分类指标。

Conclusion: EHSAN为阿拉伯语医疗领域方面级情感分析提供了可扩展且有效的解决方案，未来可扩展至其他医院并优化提示设计。

Abstract: Arabic-language patient feedback remains under-analysed because dialect
diversity and scarce aspect-level sentiment labels hinder automated assessment.
To address this gap, we introduce EHSAN, a data-centric hybrid pipeline that
merges ChatGPT pseudo-labelling with targeted human review to build the first
explainable Arabic aspect-based sentiment dataset for healthcare. Each sentence
is annotated with an aspect and sentiment label (positive, negative, or
neutral), forming a pioneering Arabic dataset aligned with healthcare themes,
with ChatGPT-generated rationales provided for each label to enhance
transparency. To evaluate the impact of annotation quality on model
performance, we created three versions of the training data: a fully supervised
set with all labels reviewed by humans, a semi-supervised set with 50% human
review, and an unsupervised set with only machine-generated labels. We
fine-tuned two transformer models on these datasets for both aspect and
sentiment classification. Experimental results show that our Arabic-specific
model achieved high accuracy even with minimal human supervision, reflecting
only a minor performance drop when using ChatGPT-only labels. Reducing the
number of aspect classes notably improved classification metrics across the
board. These findings demonstrate an effective, scalable approach to Arabic
aspect-based sentiment analysis (SA) in healthcare, combining large language
model annotation with human expertise to produce a robust and explainable
dataset. Future directions include generalisation across hospitals, prompt
refinement, and interpretable data-driven modelling.

Result: MArgE显著优于单LLM、开源模型及非结构化多LLM方法。

Conclusion: 形式化论证机制在多LLM协作中具有优势，提升任务性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Leveraging outputs from multiple large language models (LLMs) is emerging as
a method for harnessing their power across a wide range of tasks while
mitigating their capacity for making errors, e.g., hallucinations. However,
current approaches to combining insights from multiple LLMs often involve
unstructured interactions (e.g., free debate), resulting in model generations
that are not faithfully justifiable. In this work, we introduce MArgE, a novel
framework to provide formal structure to the evidence from each LLM, in the
form of a tree of extracted arguments, for the task of claim verification. We
use a variant of Argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs), i.e. LLMs driven by frameworks
and semantics from the field of computational argumentation, to construct
structured argument trees for given claims. This process creates an inspectable
pathway from the initial arguments to the final claim verification decisions,
providing a faithful justification thereof. We show experimentally that MArgE
can significantly outperform single LLMs, including three open-source models
(4B to 8B parameters), GPT-4o-mini and existing ArgLLMs, as well as prior
methods for unstructured multi-LLM debates. We thus demonstrate the advantages

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型在字符级任务（如计数或定位字符）上的表现不佳的原因，特别是分词方式的影响。

Method: 引入CharBench基准测试，评估多种领先的开源和专有模型，分析词和分词对任务表现的相关性。

Result: 模型在CharBench上的平均准确率为43.6%和32.3%，分词属性与任务表现相关性较弱，词长和字符数影响更大。

Conclusion: CharBench为未来研究提供了工具，分词方式对字符级任务的影响需进一步研究。

Abstract: Tasks that require character-level reasoning, such as counting or locating
characters within words, remain challenging for contemporary language models. A
common conjecture is that language models' reliance on subword units, rather
than characters, contributes to their struggles with character-level tasks, yet
recent studies offer conflicting conclusions about the role of tokenization,
leaving its impact unclear. To address this gap, we introduce CharBench, a
comprehensive benchmark of character-level tasks that is two orders of
magnitude larger than existing alternatives. We evaluate a diverse range of
leading open-weight and proprietary models on CharBench and find that it
presents a significant challenge to modern LLMs, with an average accuracy of
43.6% and 32.3% on some tasks. We present an in-depth analysis of how intrinsic
properties of words and their segmentations into tokens correspond to model
performance. For counting tasks, we find that tokenization properties are
weakly correlated with correctness, while the length of the queried word and
the actual character count play a more significant part. In contrast, for tasks
requiring intra-word positional understanding, performance is negatively
correlated with the length of the token containing the queried character,
suggesting that longer tokens obscure character position information for LLMs.
We encourage future work to build on the benchmark and evaluation methodology
introduced here as tools for improving model performance on such tasks.

*Jianxiang Zang,Meiling Ning,Shihan Dou,Jiazheng Zhang,Tao Gui,Qi Zhang,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“交互蒸馏”的新方法，通过优化注意力机制来解决奖励模型（RM）中的“注意力劫持”问题，从而提供更稳定和通用的奖励信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流奖励模型（RM）在令牌级交互方面存在不足，导致其判断信号容易被上下文中的错误注意力分配所干扰。

Method: 提出“交互蒸馏”框架，利用基于交互的自然语言理解模型作为教师模型，通过全面的注意力机制提供精细的令牌交互模式，并通过注意力对齐目标指导偏好建模。

Result: 实验表明，交互蒸馏能够提供比现有方法更稳定和通用的奖励信号。

Conclusion: 注意力劫持是奖励模型中的根本性限制，交互蒸馏为解决这一问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: The reward model (RM), as the core component of reinforcement learning from
human feedback (RLHF) for large language models (LLMs), responsible for
providing reward signals to generated responses. However, mainstream preference
modeling in RM is inadequate in terms of token-level interaction, making its
judgment signals vulnerable to being hacked by misallocated attention to
context. This stems from two fundamental limitations: (1) Current preference
modeling employs decoder-only architectures, where the unidirectional causal
attention mechanism leads to forward-decaying intra-sequence attention within
the prompt-response sequence. (2) The independent Siamese-encoding paradigm
induces the absence of token-level inter-sequence attention between chosen and
rejected sequences. To address this "attention hacking", we propose
"Interaction Distillation", a novel training framework for more adequate
preference modeling through attention-level optimization. The method introduces
an interaction-based natural language understanding model as the teacher to
provide sophisticated token interaction patterns via comprehensive attention,
and guides the preference modeling to simulate teacher model's interaction
pattern through an attentional alignment objective. Through extensive
experiments, interaction distillation has demonstrated its ability to provide
more stable and generalizable reward signals compared to state-of-the-art RM
optimization methods that target data noise, highlighting the attention hacking
constitute a more fundamental limitation in RM.

### [323] [Pointer: Linear-Complexity Long-Range Modeling without Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02631)
*Zixi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Pointer是一种新型架构，通过指针链实现线性复杂度O(NK)的长序列建模，性能优越且无需预训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决标准注意力机制O(N²)复杂度的问题，提供高效的长距离依赖建模方案。

Method: 采用层间指针链机制，每层指针选择依赖于前一层指针位置，形成显式长距离连接。

Result: 在长序列上实现2-10倍加速，2048个token的复制任务中保持>95%准确率，并学习到可解释的指针模式。

Conclusion: Pointer为无需预训练的高效长距离建模提供了有吸引力的替代方案。

Abstract: We introduce Pointer, a novel architecture that achieves linear $O(NK)$
complexity for long-range sequence modeling while maintaining superior
performance without requiring pre-training. Unlike standard attention
mechanisms that compute $O(N^2)$ pairwise interactions, our approach uses
layer-wise pointer chaining where each layer's pointer selection depends on
previous layer's pointer positions, creating explicit long-distance connections
through pointer chains. We demonstrate that this architecture achieves
$2$--$10\times$ speedup on long sequences compared to standard transformers,
maintains $>95\%$ accuracy on copy tasks at distances up to 2048 tokens, and
learns interpretable pointer patterns that reveal structured dependency
modeling. Our experiments on efficiency benchmarks, long-range dependency
tasks, and interpretability analysis show that Pointer offers a compelling
alternative to attention mechanisms for scenarios requiring efficient
long-range modeling without pre-training dependencies.

TL;DR: 论文分析了多语言基准数据集的质量问题，通过手动检查法语和泰卢固语数据集中的错误，发现修订后的数据集对LLM性能影响显著（差异达10%），建议数据集应定期检查和版本化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对多语言基准数据集的质量关注不足，尽管完全人工标注的测试集也存在错误。本文旨在揭示这一问题并提出改进建议。

Method: 手动分析法语和泰卢固语的多语言评估数据集，识别错误，并比较多个LLM在原始和修订数据集上的性能差异。

Result: 发现数据集错误导致LLM性能差异显著（近10%），修订后的数据集对结果影响较大。

Conclusion: 测试集不应被视为不可变，需定期检查和版本化。论文为数据集创建者和使用者提供了改进质量的建议。

Abstract: Several multilingual benchmark datasets have been developed in a
semi-automatic manner in the recent past to measure progress and understand the
state-of-the-art in the multilingual capabilities of Large Language Models.
However, there is not a lot of attention paid to the quality of the datasets
themselves, despite the existence of previous work in identifying errors in
even fully human-annotated test sets. In this paper, we manually analyze recent
multilingual evaluation sets in two languages - French and Telugu, identifying
several errors in the process. We compare the performance difference across
several LLMs with the original and revised versions of the datasets and
identify large differences (almost 10% in some cases) in both languages). Based
on these results, we argue that test sets should not be considered immutable
and should be revisited, checked for correctness, and potentially versioned. We
end with some recommendations for both the dataset creators as well as
consumers on addressing the dataset quality issues.

*Sara Yavari,Rahul Nitin Pandya,Jacob Furst*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种半监督的两阶段框架，用于MRI扫描中脑肿瘤的精确分割，无需真实掩码，并在BraTS 2021数据集上表现优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI扫描中脑肿瘤的精确分割对临床诊断和治疗规划至关重要，但现有方法在更大、更异构的数据集上表现不佳。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：第一阶段通过DDPM模型进行跨模态合成，生成残差图作为空间先验；第二阶段使用轻量级U-Net结合残差图和多模态数据进行分割。

Result: 在BraTS 2021数据集上，全肿瘤分割的Dice得分为93.02%，IoU为86.7%，优于基线。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了分割的准确性和可扩展性，适用于真实世界的多中心MRI数据集。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain tumors in MRI scans is critical for clinical
diagnosis and treatment planning. We propose a semi-supervised, two-stage
framework that extends the ReCoSeg approach to the larger and more
heterogeneous BraTS 2021 dataset, while eliminating the need for ground-truth
masks for the segmentation objective. In the first stage, a residual-guided
denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) performs cross-modal synthesis
by reconstructing the T1ce modality from FLAIR, T1, and T2 scans. The residual
maps, capturing differences between predicted and actual T1ce images, serve as
spatial priors to enhance downstream segmentation. In the second stage, a
lightweight U-Net takes as input the concatenation of residual maps, computed
as the difference between real T1ce and synthesized T1ce, with T1, T2, and
FLAIR modalities to improve whole tumor segmentation. To address the increased
scale and variability of BraTS 2021, we apply slice-level filtering to exclude
non-informative samples and optimize thresholding strategies to balance
precision and recall. Our method achieves a Dice score of $93.02\%$ and an IoU
of $86.7\%$ for whole tumor segmentation on the BraTS 2021 dataset,
outperforming the ReCoSeg baseline on BraTS 2020 (Dice: $91.7\%$, IoU:
$85.3\%$), and demonstrating improved accuracy and scalability for real-world,
multi-center MRI datasets.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Mobile U-ViT的移动模型，专为医学图像分割设计，结合了计算效率和医学图像特定的架构优势，在多个数据集上实现了最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有移动模型在医学图像任务上表现不佳的问题，因医学图像与自然图像的信息密度差异显著，需要轻量且高性能的网络。

Method: 采用ConvUtr作为分层补丁嵌入，引入大核局部-全局-局部（LGL）块进行高效信息交换，并结合轻量级Transformer瓶颈和级联解码器。

Result: 在八个公共2D和3D数据集上实现了最优性能，包括在四个未见数据集上的零样本测试。

Conclusion: Mobile U-ViT是一种高效、强大且通用的移动医学图像分析解决方案。

Abstract: In clinical practice, medical image analysis often requires efficient
execution on resource-constrained mobile devices. However, existing mobile
models-primarily optimized for natural images-tend to perform poorly on medical
tasks due to the significant information density gap between natural and
medical domains. Combining computational efficiency with medical
imaging-specific architectural advantages remains a challenge when developing
lightweight, universal, and high-performing networks. To address this, we
propose a mobile model called Mobile U-shaped Vision Transformer (Mobile U-ViT)
tailored for medical image segmentation. Specifically, we employ the newly
purposed ConvUtr as a hierarchical patch embedding, featuring a
parameter-efficient large-kernel CNN with inverted bottleneck fusion. This
design exhibits transformer-like representation learning capacity while being
lighter and faster. To enable efficient local-global information exchange, we
introduce a novel Large-kernel Local-Global-Local (LGL) block that effectively
balances the low information density and high-level semantic discrepancy of
medical images. Finally, we incorporate a shallow and lightweight transformer
bottleneck for long-range modeling and employ a cascaded decoder with
downsample skip connections for dense prediction. Despite its reduced
computational demands, our medical-optimized architecture achieves
state-of-the-art performance across eight public 2D and 3D datasets covering
diverse imaging modalities, including zero-shot testing on four unseen
datasets. These results establish it as an efficient yet powerful and
generalization solution for mobile medical image analysis. Code is available at
https://github.com/FengheTan9/Mobile-U-ViT.
