### [1] [Preventing Shortcuts in Adapter Training via Providing the Shortcuts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20887)
*Anujraaj Argo Goyal,Guocheng Gordon Qian,Huseyin Coskun,Aarush Gupta,Himmy Tam,Daniil Ostashev,Ju Hu,Dhritiman Sagar,Sergey Tulyakov,Kfir Aberman,Kuan-Chieh Jackson Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training方法，通过在适配器训练中为混淆因素建立辅助模块，防止目标属性与偶然因素纠缠，提高生成质量和提示遵循能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有适配器训练方法容易将目标属性与姿势、表情、光照等偶然因素纠缠，限制了泛化能力和文本提示的遵循性。

Method: 在适配器训练期间为混淆因素建立辅助模块（如ControlNet或LoRA），让这些因素通过这些模块处理，避免适配器学习它们，然后在推理时移除这些辅助模块。

Result: 应用于面部和全身身份注入任务时，该方法提高了生成质量、多样性和提示遵循能力。

Conclusion: 在大模型时代，寻求解耦表示的最有效路径可能是为不应学习的内容建立捷径。

Abstract: Adapter-based training has emerged as a key mechanism for extending the
capabilities of powerful foundation image generators, enabling personalized and
stylized text-to-image synthesis. These adapters are typically trained to
capture a specific target attribute, such as subject identity, using
single-image reconstruction objectives. However, because the input image
inevitably contains a mixture of visual factors, adapters are prone to entangle
the target attribute with incidental ones, such as pose, expression, and
lighting. This spurious correlation problem limits generalization and obstructs
the model's ability to adhere to the input text prompt. In this work, we
uncover a simple yet effective solution: provide the very shortcuts we wish to
eliminate during adapter training. In Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training,
confounding factors are routed through auxiliary modules, such as ControlNet or
LoRA, eliminating the incentive for the adapter to internalize them. The
auxiliary modules are then removed during inference. When applied to tasks like
facial and full-body identity injection, our approach improves generation
quality, diversity, and prompt adherence. These results point to a general
design principle in the era of large models: when seeking disentangled
representations, the most effective path may be to establish shortcuts for what
should NOT be learned.

### [2] [Video-As-Prompt: Unified Semantic Control for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20888)
*Yuxuan Bian,Xin Chen,Zenan Li,Tiancheng Zhi,Shen Sang,Linjie Luo,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-As-Prompt (VAP) 提出了一种新的视频生成范式，通过参考视频作为语义提示来引导冻结的视频扩散变换器，实现了统一、可泛化的语义控制，无需特定条件微调或任务特定架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频生成中统一、可泛化语义控制的挑战，现有方法要么引入伪影，要么依赖非泛化的特定条件微调或任务特定架构。

Method: 使用参考视频作为直接语义提示，通过插拔式混合变换器专家引导冻结的视频扩散变换器，采用时间偏置位置嵌入消除虚假映射先验，实现鲁棒的上下文检索。

Result: VAP 作为单一统一模型，在开源方法中达到最新技术水平，获得38.7%的用户偏好率，可与领先的特定条件商业模型相媲美，并展示了强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: VAP 代表了向通用、可控视频生成的重要进展，支持各种下游应用，具有强零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: Unified, generalizable semantic control in video generation remains a
critical open challenge. Existing methods either introduce artifacts by
enforcing inappropriate pixel-wise priors from structure-based controls, or
rely on non-generalizable, condition-specific finetuning or task-specific
architectures. We introduce Video-As-Prompt (VAP), a new paradigm that reframes
this problem as in-context generation. VAP leverages a reference video as a
direct semantic prompt, guiding a frozen Video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) via
a plug-and-play Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) expert. This architecture
prevents catastrophic forgetting and is guided by a temporally biased position
embedding that eliminates spurious mapping priors for robust context retrieval.
To power this approach and catalyze future research, we built VAP-Data, the
largest dataset for semantic-controlled video generation with over 100K paired
videos across 100 semantic conditions. As a single unified model, VAP sets a
new state-of-the-art for open-source methods, achieving a 38.7% user preference
rate that rivals leading condition-specific commercial models. VAP's strong
zero-shot generalization and support for various downstream applications mark a
significant advance toward general-purpose, controllable video generation.

### [3] [Focal Modulation and Bidirectional Feature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20933)
*Moin Safdar,Shahzaib Iqbal,Mehwish Mehmood,Mubeen Ghafoor,Tariq M. Khan,Imran Razzak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FM-BFF-Net网络，结合CNN和Transformer，使用焦点调制注意力机制和双向特征融合模块，提升医学图像分割的边界精度和对病变变化的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割对临床诊断和治疗至关重要，但传统CNN难以捕获全局上下文信息和长距离依赖关系，影响对复杂边界和多样尺寸结构的精确分割。

Method: 结合卷积和Transformer组件，采用焦点调制注意力机制增强上下文感知，引入双向特征融合模块实现编码器-解码器跨尺度高效交互。

Result: 在8个公开数据集上的实验表明，FM-BFF-Net在Jaccard指数和Dice系数上持续超越最新方法，验证了其有效性和适应性。

Conclusion: FM-BFF-Net通过融合CNN和Transformer优势，有效解决了医学图像分割中的全局上下文捕获和边界精度问题，适用于多种医学成像场景。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is essential for clinical applications such as
disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease development monitoring
because it provides precise morphological and spatial information on anatomical
structures that directly influence treatment decisions. Convolutional neural
networks significantly impact image segmentation; however, since convolution
operations are local, capturing global contextual information and long-range
dependencies is still challenging. Their capacity to precisely segment
structures with complicated borders and a variety of sizes is impacted by this
restriction. Since transformers use self-attention methods to capture global
context and long-range dependencies efficiently, integrating transformer-based
architecture with CNNs is a feasible approach to overcoming these challenges.
To address these challenges, we propose the Focal Modulation and Bidirectional
Feature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation, referred to as
FM-BFF-Net in the remainder of this paper. The network combines convolutional
and transformer components, employs a focal modulation attention mechanism to
refine context awareness, and introduces a bidirectional feature fusion module
that enables efficient interaction between encoder and decoder representations
across scales. Through this design, FM-BFF-Net enhances boundary precision and
robustness to variations in lesion size, shape, and contrast. Extensive
experiments on eight publicly available datasets, including polyp detection,
skin lesion segmentation, and ultrasound imaging, show that FM-BFF-Net
consistently surpasses recent state-of-the-art methods in Jaccard index and
Dice coefficient, confirming its effectiveness and adaptability for diverse
medical imaging scenarios.

### [4] [Generative Point Tracking with Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20951)
*Mattie Tesfaldet,Adam W. Harley,Konstantinos G. Derpanis,Derek Nowrouzezahrai,Christopher Pal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenPT是一个生成式点轨迹跟踪框架，通过流匹配建模多模态轨迹，在遮挡点跟踪上达到最先进性能，同时在可见点跟踪上保持竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前判别式模型在点跟踪中只能回归到均值/众数，无法捕捉不确定性下的多模态轨迹，特别是在视觉遮挡和外观变化的情况下。

Method: 提出生成式点跟踪器(GenPT)，采用流匹配训练框架，结合判别式跟踪器的迭代优化、跨窗口一致性的窗口依赖先验，以及针对点坐标调优的方差调度。

Result: 在PointOdyssey、Dynamic Replica和TAP-Vid基准测试中评估，并在增强遮挡的TAP-Vid变体上验证遮挡点跟踪性能，显示模型能有效捕捉多模态。

Conclusion: GenPT能够捕捉点轨迹的多模态特性，在遮挡点跟踪上达到最先进精度，同时在可见点跟踪上与现有判别式跟踪器保持竞争力。

Abstract: Tracking a point through a video can be a challenging task due to uncertainty
arising from visual obfuscations, such as appearance changes and occlusions.
Although current state-of-the-art discriminative models excel in regressing
long-term point trajectory estimates -- even through occlusions -- they are
limited to regressing to a mean (or mode) in the presence of uncertainty, and
fail to capture multi-modality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
Generative Point Tracker (GenPT), a generative framework for modelling
multi-modal trajectories. GenPT is trained with a novel flow matching
formulation that combines the iterative refinement of discriminative trackers,
a window-dependent prior for cross-window consistency, and a variance schedule
tuned specifically for point coordinates. We show how our model's generative
capabilities can be leveraged to improve point trajectory estimates by
utilizing a best-first search strategy on generated samples during inference,
guided by the model's own confidence of its predictions. Empirically, we
evaluate GenPT against the current state of the art on the standard
PointOdyssey, Dynamic Replica, and TAP-Vid benchmarks. Further, we introduce a
TAP-Vid variant with additional occlusions to assess occluded point tracking
performance and highlight our model's ability to capture multi-modality. GenPT
is capable of capturing the multi-modality in point trajectories, which
translates to state-of-the-art tracking accuracy on occluded points, while
maintaining competitive tracking accuracy on visible points compared to extant
discriminative point trackers.

### [5] [An Automatic Detection Method for Hematoma Features in Placental Abruption Ultrasound Images Based on Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21495)
*Xiaoqing Liu,Jitai Han,Hua Yan,Peng Li,Sida Tang,Ying Li,Kaiwen Zhang,Min Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出EH-YOLOv11n模型，通过小样本学习实现胎盘超声图像中血肿特征的自动检测，检测准确率达78%，比YOLOv11n提升2.5%，比YOLOv8提升13.7%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胎盘早剥是妊娠期严重并发症，传统超声诊断依赖医师经验，存在主观偏差和诊断不一致问题，需要自动检测方法。

Method: 基于YOLOv11n改进：集成小波卷积和坐标卷积增强频域和空间特征提取；加入级联组注意力机制抑制超声伪影和遮挡干扰；通过多维优化提升边界框定位精度。

Result: 检测准确率78%，在精确率-召回率曲线、置信度得分和遮挡场景下表现显著优于基准模型，兼具高精度和实时处理能力。

Conclusion: 该模型为胎盘早剥的计算机辅助诊断提供了可靠解决方案，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: Placental abruption is a severe complication during pregnancy, and its early
accurate diagnosis is crucial for ensuring maternal and fetal safety.
Traditional ultrasound diagnostic methods heavily rely on physician experience,
leading to issues such as subjective bias and diagnostic inconsistencies. This
paper proposes an improved model, EH-YOLOv11n (Enhanced Hemorrhage-YOLOv11n),
based on small-sample learning, aiming to achieve automatic detection of
hematoma features in placental ultrasound images. The model enhances
performance through multidimensional optimization: it integrates wavelet
convolution and coordinate convolution to strengthen frequency and spatial
feature extraction; incorporates a cascaded group attention mechanism to
suppress ultrasound artifacts and occlusion interference, thereby improving
bounding box localization accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate a
detection accuracy of 78%, representing a 2.5% improvement over YOLOv11n and a
13.7% increase over YOLOv8. The model exhibits significant superiority in
precision-recall curves, confidence scores, and occlusion scenarios. Combining
high accuracy with real-time processing, this model provides a reliable
solution for computer-aided diagnosis of placental abruption, holding
significant clinical application value.

### [6] [3DReasonKnee: Advancing Grounded Reasoning in Medical Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20967)
*Sraavya Sambara,Sung Eun Kim,Xiaoman Zhang,Luyang Luo,Shreya Johri,Mohammed Baharoon,Du Hyun Ro,Pranav Rajpurkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了3DReasonKnee数据集，这是首个用于医学图像的3D基础推理数据集，包含494k个高质量的五元组，支持视觉语言模型在3D医学图像中进行解剖区域定位和逐步推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型难以在3D医学图像中定位解剖区域并进行逐步推理，这与临床诊断工作流程不匹配，影响了临床医生与AI的信任合作。

Method: 创建了3DReasonKnee数据集，包含7,970个3D膝关节MRI体积，每个样本包括3D MRI体积、诊断问题、3D边界框定位、临床医生生成的诊断推理步骤和结构化严重程度评估。

Result: 建立了ReasonKnee-Bench评估框架，对五种最先进的视觉语言模型进行了基准测试，为3D医学图像的基础推理能力提供了基线性能。

Conclusion: 3DReasonKnee作为骨科医生诊断专业知识的存储库，为推进多模态医学AI系统向3D、临床对齐的局部决策能力提供了重要测试平台。

Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to ground anatomical regions
in 3D medical images and reason about them in a step-by-step manner, a key
requirement of real-world diagnostic assessment. This ability is essential for
aligning model outputs with the diagnostic workflows clinicians use in
practice, enabling trustworthy clinician-AI collaboration. Existing 3D datasets
provide localization labels, but none support this "grounded reasoning"
ability. To address this gap, we introduce 3DReasonKnee, the first 3D grounded
reasoning dataset for medical images, which provides 494k high-quality
quintuples derived from 7,970 3D knee MRI volumes. Each quintuple includes: (1)
the 3D MRI volume, (2) a diagnostic question targeting a specific anatomical
region (3) a 3D bounding box localizing the relevant anatomical structures, (4)
clinician-generated diagnostic reasoning steps that explicitly detail the 3D
reasoning process, and (5) structured severity assessments for the relevant
anatomical region. The creation and validation of 3DReasonKnee, involving over
450 hours of expert clinician time for manually segmenting MRIs and generating
reasoning chains, ensures its superior quality and clinical relevance. We
establish ReasonKnee-Bench to evaluate localization and diagnostic accuracy,
providing insight into VLM ability to perform grounding and severity assessment
across anatomical regions and diagnostic inquiries. We benchmark five
state-of-the-art VLMs, providing baseline performance for ReasonKnee-Bench. By
providing this unique resource of expert-annotated 3D reasoning pathways,
3DReasonKnee serves as a repository of orthopedic surgeons' diagnostic
expertise and offers a vital testbed for advancing multimodal medical AI
systems towards 3D, clinically aligned, localized decision-making capabilities.

*Takahiro Kushida,Kenichiro Tanaka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用热偏振线索进行详细3D形状重建的新方法，该方法不依赖光照和材料属性，通过长波红外偏振成像避免了可见光偏振分析的模糊性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D重建方法受限于光照和材料属性，无法有效处理透明、半透明和异质物体。热偏振成像可以克服这些限制，提供更准确的形状重建。

Method: 建立了偏振观测的一般理论，利用多视角热偏振图像进行3D形状重建，通过长波红外偏振成像解决可见光偏振分析的模糊性问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能有效重建透明、半透明和异质物体的精细细节，性能优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 热偏振成像为3D形状重建提供了一种独立于光照和材料属性的有效方法，特别适用于传统方法难以处理的物体类型。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for detailed 3D shape reconstruction
utilizing thermal polarization cues. Unlike state-of-the-art methods, the
proposed approach is independent of illumination and material properties. In
this paper, we formulate a general theory of polarization observation and show
that long-wave infrared (LWIR) polarimetric imaging is free from the
ambiguities that affect visible polarization analyses. Subsequently, we propose
a method for recovering detailed 3D shapes using multi-view thermal
polarimetric images. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
effectively reconstructs fine details in transparent, translucent, and
heterogeneous objects, outperforming existing techniques.

### [8] [VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for Visual Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20994)
*Jesimon Barreto,Carlos Caetano,André Araujo,William Robson Schwartz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VESSA提出了一种基于视频的无监督微调方法，用于视觉基础模型在新领域的自适应，无需标注数据，仅使用多视角物体中心视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在分布偏移和标注稀缺的领域表现不佳，而传统的自监督学习方法对视觉编码器模型效果有限。

Method: 采用自蒸馏范式，利用多视角物体中心视频进行无监督微调，精心调整预测头并部署参数高效适应技术。

Result: 在3个视觉基础模型和2个数据集上的实验表明，VESSA在下游分类任务中相比基础模型和先前适应方法有稳定提升。

Conclusion: VESSA能够有效适应视觉基础模型到新领域，无需标注数据，学习对多样化捕获条件的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Foundation models have advanced computer vision by enabling strong
performance across diverse tasks through large-scale pretraining and supervised
fine-tuning. However, they may underperform in domains with distribution shifts
and scarce labels, where supervised fine-tuning may be infeasible. While
continued self-supervised learning for model adaptation is common for
generative language models, this strategy has not proven effective for
vision-centric encoder models. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel
formulation of self-supervised fine-tuning for vision foundation models, where
the model is adapted to a new domain without requiring annotations, leveraging
only short multi-view object-centric videos. Our method is referred to as
VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for visual
foundation models. VESSA's training technique is based on a self-distillation
paradigm, where it is critical to carefully tune prediction heads and deploy
parameter-efficient adaptation techniques - otherwise, the model may quickly
forget its pretrained knowledge and reach a degraded state. VESSA benefits
significantly from multi-view object observations sourced from different frames
in an object-centric video, efficiently learning robustness to varied capture
conditions, without the need of annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
with 3 vision foundation models on 2 datasets, VESSA demonstrates consistent
improvements in downstream classification tasks, compared to the base models
and previous adaptation methods. Code is publicly available at
https://github.com/jesimonbarreto/VESSA.

*Jiaqi Hu,Hongli Xu,Junwen Huang,Peter KT Yu,Slobodan Ilic,Benjamin Busam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于工业环境中未见物体2D检测的标准化插件式流程，通过低光图像增强和基于基础模型的背景去除来减少域偏移和背景伪影，显著提升检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有6D姿态估计流程在工业环境中的杂乱、光照差和复杂背景等挑战条件下性能下降，检测成为关键瓶颈。

Method: 基于当前SOTA基线，采用低光图像增强和基于开放词汇检测的基础模型引导的背景去除，抑制原始SAM输出中的假阳性。

Result: 在真实工业bin-picking基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著提升检测精度，且推理开销可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 所提方法在有效性和实用性方面表现出色，为下游姿态估计提供更可靠的检测结果。

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation is essential for robotic manipulation in
industrial environments. Existing pipelines typically rely on off-the-shelf
object detectors followed by cropping and pose refinement, but their
performance degrades under challenging conditions such as clutter, poor
lighting, and complex backgrounds, making detection the critical bottleneck. In
this work, we introduce a standardized and plug-in pipeline for 2D detection of
unseen objects in industrial settings. Based on current SOTA baselines, our
approach reduces domain shift and background artifacts through low-light image
enhancement and background removal guided by open-vocabulary detection with
foundation models. This design suppresses the false positives prevalent in raw
SAM outputs, yielding more reliable detections for downstream pose estimation.
Extensive experiments on real-world industrial bin-picking benchmarks from BOP
demonstrate that our method significantly boosts detection accuracy while
incurring negligible inference overhead, showing the effectiveness and
practicality of the proposed method.

TL;DR: 使用深度学习自动检测地震后混凝土结构中裸露钢筋，通过YOLO模型识别裂缝、剥落和钢筋暴露，建立混合框架评估结构损伤等级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地震后及时评估结构完整性对公共安全和应急响应至关重要，裸露钢筋的数量和分布能反映结构损伤程度。

Method: 基于深度学习框架，使用土耳其地震图像数据集，通过微调、数据增强和YOLOv11模型检测裂缝、剥落和裸露钢筋，建立分类框架识别建筑内外和结构构件。

Result: 开发了自动可靠的损伤等级确定混合框架，证明利用图像数据收集、标注和深度学习方法可实现灾后快速自动化损伤检测。

Conclusion: 研究表明通过图像数据和深度学习技术，能够在各种损伤情境下实现快速自动化的灾后损伤检测。

Abstract: Timely assessment of integrity of structures after seismic events is crucial
for public safety and emergency response. This study focuses on assessing the
structural damage conditions using deep learning methods to detect exposed
steel reinforcement in concrete buildings and bridges after large earthquakes.
Steel bars are typically exposed after concrete spalling or large flexural or
shear cracks. The amount and distribution of exposed steel reinforcement is an
indication of structural damage and degradation. To automatically detect
exposed steel bars, new datasets of images collected after the 2023 Turkey
Earthquakes were labeled to represent a wide variety of damaged concrete
structures. The proposed method builds upon a deep learning framework, enhanced
with fine-tuning, data augmentation, and testing on public datasets. An
automated classification framework is developed that can be used to identify
inside/outside buildings and structural components. Then, a YOLOv11 (You Only
Look Once) model is trained to detect cracking and spalling damage and exposed
bars. Another YOLO model is finetuned to distinguish different categories of
structural damage levels. All these trained models are used to create a hybrid
framework to automatically and reliably determine the damage levels from input
images. This research demonstrates that rapid and automated damage detection
following disasters is achievable across diverse damage contexts by utilizing
image data collection, annotation, and deep learning approaches.

TL;DR: ZING-3D是一个零样本3D场景图生成框架，利用预训练基础模型实现开放词汇识别，支持增量更新和3D几何接地，适用于机器人应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D场景图生成方法局限于单视图、不支持增量更新、缺乏3D几何接地，而这些对于具身场景至关重要。

Method: 利用VLM推理生成丰富的2D场景图，通过深度信息将其接地到3D空间，节点包含开放词汇对象特征、3D位置和语义上下文，边捕捉空间和语义关系及物体间距离。

Result: 在Replica和HM3D数据集上的实验表明，ZING-3D能有效捕获空间和关系知识，无需任务特定训练。

Conclusion: ZING-3D框架成功实现了零样本3D场景图生成，支持增量更新和几何接地，为下游机器人应用提供了有效的场景理解能力。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about complex 3D environments requires structured
scene representations that capture not only objects but also their semantic and
spatial relationships. While recent works on 3D scene graph generation have
leveraged pretrained VLMs without task-specific fine-tuning, they are largely
confined to single-view settings, fail to support incremental updates as new
observations arrive and lack explicit geometric grounding in 3D space, all of
which are essential for embodied scenarios. In this paper, we propose, ZING-3D,
a framework that leverages the vast knowledge of pretrained foundation models
to enable open-vocabulary recognition and generate a rich semantic
representation of the scene in a zero-shot manner while also enabling
incremental updates and geometric grounding in 3D space, making it suitable for
downstream robotics applications. Our approach leverages VLM reasoning to
generate a rich 2D scene graph, which is grounded in 3D using depth
information. Nodes represent open-vocabulary objects with features, 3D
locations, and semantic context, while edges capture spatial and semantic
relations with inter-object distances. Our experiments on scenes from the
Replica and HM3D dataset show that ZING-3D is effective at capturing spatial
and relational knowledge without the need of task-specific training.

*Guoan Xu,Yang Xiao,Wenjing Jia,Guangwei Gao,Guo-Jun Qi,Chia-Wen Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出WaveSeg解码器架构，在空间和小波域联合优化特征细化，利用小波域频率先验和基于Mamba的注意力机制，实现高效精确的语义分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义分割网络过度依赖强大的预训练编码器，但使用简单的解码器，导致语义上下文和细粒度细节保留之间的权衡不佳。

Method: 1) 从输入图像学习高频分量作为显式先验强化边界细节；2) 应用多尺度融合机制Dual Domain Operation (DDO)；3) 提出Spectrum Decomposition Attention (SDA)块，利用Mamba的线性复杂度长程建模增强高频结构细节；4) 使用重参数化卷积在小波域保持低频语义完整性；5) 残差引导融合整合多尺度特征和边界感知表示。

Result: 在标准基准测试上的广泛实验表明，WaveSeg在定量和定性上都持续优于最先进的方法，实现了高效精确的分割。

Conclusion: WaveSeg通过在小波域结合频率先验和基于Mamba的注意力机制，能够有效平衡语义上下文和细节保留，为语义分割任务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: While recent semantic segmentation networks heavily rely on powerful
pretrained encoders, most employ simplistic decoders, leading to suboptimal
trade-offs between semantic context and fine-grained detail preservation. To
address this, we propose a novel decoder architecture, WaveSeg, which jointly
optimizes feature refinement in spatial and wavelet domains. Specifically,
high-frequency components are first learned from input images as explicit
priors to reinforce boundary details at early stages. A multi-scale fusion
mechanism, Dual Domain Operation (DDO), is then applied, and the novel Spectrum
Decomposition Attention (SDA) block is proposed, which is developed to leverage
Mamba's linear-complexity long-range modeling to enhance high-frequency
structural details. Meanwhile, reparameterized convolutions are applied to
preserve low-frequency semantic integrity in the wavelet domain. Finally, a
residual-guided fusion integrates multi-scale features with boundary-aware
representations at native resolution, producing semantically and structurally
rich feature maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that WaveSeg, leveraging wavelet-domain frequency prior with Mamba-based
attention, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both
quantitatively and qualitatively, achieving efficient and precise segmentation.

*Youssef Megahed,Atallah Madi,Dina El Demellawy,Adrian D. C. Chan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种集成专家文本概念的视觉语言模型框架，用于赫希施普龙病肠肌层神经丛分类，通过结合医学知识和视觉特征提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在肠肌层神经丛分类任务中表现良好但缺乏可解释性，且与医生决策方式不符，需要结合专家知识来提升模型的临床相关性。

Method: 使用基于对比语言-图像预训练的视觉语言模型，整合专家来源的文本概念（医学教科书和论文），通过大型语言模型生成提示词并经团队审核，用QuiltNet编码，将临床相关语义线索与视觉特征对齐。

Result: 提出的模型在各项分类指标上表现优异，准确率83.9%，精确率86.6%，特异性87.6%，优于VGG-19、ResNet-18和ResNet-50等CNN模型。

Conclusion: 多模态学习在组织病理学中具有潜力，整合专家知识可以产生更具临床相关性的模型输出。

Abstract: Hirschsprung's disease is defined as the congenital absence of ganglion cells
in some segment(s) of the colon. The muscle cannot make coordinated movements
to propel stool in that section, most commonly leading to obstruction. The
diagnosis and treatment for this disease require a clear identification of
different region(s) of the myenteric plexus, where ganglion cells should be
present, on the microscopic view of the tissue slide. While deep learning
approaches, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, have performed very well in
this task, they are often treated as black boxes, with minimal understanding
gained from them, and may not conform to how a physician makes decisions. In
this study, we propose a novel framework that integrates expert-derived textual
concepts into a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training-based vision-language
model to guide plexus classification. Using prompts derived from expert sources
(e.g., medical textbooks and papers) generated by large language models and
reviewed by our team before being encoded with QuiltNet, our approach aligns
clinically relevant semantic cues with visual features. Experimental results
show that the proposed model demonstrated superior discriminative capability
across different classification metrics as it outperformed CNN-based models,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于直方图的Retinex模型（HistRetinex），用于快速低光照图像增强，通过将Retinex模型从空间域扩展到直方图域，显著提高了处理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于Retinex的低光照图像增强方法在处理大尺寸图像时耗时较长，需要一种更高效的增强方法。

Method: 定义了直方图位置矩阵和直方图计数矩阵，建立光照、反射率和低光照图像直方图之间的关系；构建了两级优化模型，通过求解得到光照和反射率直方图的迭代公式；通过直方图匹配实现图像增强。

Conclusion: HistRetinex模型通过直方图域的扩展实现了快速高效的低光照图像增强，在保持增强质量的同时显著提升了处理速度。

Abstract: Retinex-based low-light image enhancement methods are widely used due to
their excellent performance. However, most of them are time-consuming for
large-sized images. This paper extends the Retinex model from the spatial
domain to the histogram domain, and proposes a novel histogram-based Retinex
model for fast low-light image enhancement, named HistRetinex. Firstly, we
define the histogram location matrix and the histogram count matrix, which
establish the relationship among histograms of the illumination, reflectance
and the low-light image. Secondly, based on the prior information and the
histogram-based Retinex model, we construct a novel two-level optimization
model. Through solving the optimization model, we give the iterative formulas
of the illumination histogram and the reflectance histogram, respectively.
Finally, we enhance the low-light image through matching its histogram with the
one provided by HistRetinex. Experimental results demonstrate that the
HistRetinex outperforms existing enhancement methods in both visibility and
performance metrics, while executing 1.86 seconds on 1000*664 resolution
images, achieving a minimum time saving of 6.67 seconds.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了主动视觉推理(AVR)任务，将视觉推理扩展到部分可观察的交互环境中，要求智能体通过物理动作主动获取信息、整合多步观察并动态调整决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型的视觉推理主要在静态、完全可观察环境中研究，而真实世界信息往往因遮挡或有限视野而不完整。受人类主动探索环境能力的启发，需要开发能够主动获取信息的推理系统。

Method: 引入CLEVR-AVR模拟基准测试和AVR-152k大规模数据集，包含丰富的思维链标注。开发了PhysVLM-AVR模型，在更高阶马尔可夫决策过程中训练智能体进行不确定性识别、信息增益预测和动作选择。

Result: PhysVLM-AVR在CLEVR-AVR、具身推理(OpenEQA, RoboVQA)和被动视觉推理(GeoMath, Geometry30K)任务上达到最先进性能。分析发现当前具身MLLM虽然能检测信息不完整性，但在通过交互主动获取和整合新信息方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 主动视觉推理是视觉推理的重要扩展方向，当前模型在主动推理能力上存在根本性差距，需要进一步研究如何让智能体像人类一样通过交互主动获取信息。

Abstract: Visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has primarily
been studied in static, fully observable settings, limiting their effectiveness
in real-world environments where information is often incomplete due to
occlusion or limited field of view. Humans, in contrast, actively explore and
interact with their environment-moving, examining, and manipulating objects-to
gather information through a closed-loop process integrating perception,
reasoning, and action. Inspired by this human capability, we introduce the
Active Visual Reasoning (AVR) task, extending visual reasoning to partially
observable, interactive environments. AVR necessitates agents to: (1) actively
acquire information via sequential physical actions, (2) integrate observations
across multiple steps for coherent reasoning, and (3) dynamically adjust
decisions based on evolving visual feedback. To rigorously evaluate AVR, we
introduce CLEVR-AVR, a simulation benchmark featuring multi-round interactive
environments designed to assess both reasoning correctness and
information-gathering efficiency. We present AVR-152k, a large-scale dataset
that offers rich Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations detailing iterative
reasoning for uncertainty identification, action-conditioned information gain
prediction, and information-maximizing action selection, crucial for training
agents in a higher-order Markov Decision Process. Building on this, we develop
PhysVLM-AVR, an MLLM achieving state-of-the-art performance on CLEVR-AVR,
embodied reasoning (OpenEQA, RoboVQA), and passive visual reasoning (GeoMath,
Geometry30K). Our analysis also reveals that current embodied MLLMs, despite
detecting information incompleteness, struggle to actively acquire and
integrate new information through interaction, highlighting a fundamental gap
in active reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种面向城市规模LiDAR的对象中心、不确定性感知变化检测方法，通过多分辨率NDT和点对平面ICP对齐，结合语义实例分割和类别约束二分图匹配，在保持内存效率的同时实现高精度变化检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对垂直偏差、地面坡度敏感，缺乏对象身份信息，内存需求大，无法处理分裂合并情况，且忽略不确定性。需要一种能够处理城市规模LiDAR数据、保持对象一致性并考虑不确定性的变化检测方法。

Method: 采用多分辨率NDT和点对平面ICP进行时序对齐，高度归一化，基于配准协方差和表面粗糙度计算检测水平，使用几何代理种子跨时期关联，结合语义实例分割和类别约束二分图分配处理分裂合并，分块处理控制内存。

Conclusion: 该方法在城市规模LiDAR变化检测中表现出色，能够有效处理分裂合并情况，保持类别一致性，并在内存效率和检测精度方面取得良好平衡。

Abstract: High-definition 3D city maps underpin smart transportation, digital twins,
and autonomous driving, where object level change detection across bi temporal
LiDAR enables HD map maintenance, construction monitoring, and reliable
localization. Classical DSM differencing and image based methods are sensitive
to small vertical bias, ground slope, and viewpoint mismatch and yield cellwise
outputs without object identity. Point based neural models and voxel encodings
demand large memory, assume near perfect pre alignment, degrade thin
structures, and seldom enforce class consistent association, which leaves split
or merge cases unresolved and ignores uncertainty. We propose an object
centric, uncertainty aware pipeline for city scale LiDAR that aligns epochs
with multi resolution NDT followed by point to plane ICP, normalizes height,
and derives a per location level of detection from registration covariance and
surface roughness to calibrate decisions and suppress spurious changes.
Geometry only proxies seed cross epoch associations that are refined by
semantic and instance segmentation and a class constrained bipartite assignment
with augmented dummies to handle splits and merges while preserving per class
counts. Tiled processing bounds memory without eroding narrow ground changes,
and instance level decisions combine 3D overlap, normal direction displacement,
and height and volume differences with a histogram distance, all gated by the
local level of detection to remain stable under partial overlap and sampling
variation. On 15 representative Subiaco blocks the method attains 95.2%
accuracy, 90.4% mF1, and 82.6% mIoU, exceeding Triplet KPConv by 0.2 percentage
points in accuracy, 0.2 in mF1, and 0.8 in mIoU, with the largest gain on
Decreased where IoU reaches 74.8% and improves by 7.6 points.

Conclusion: 提出的Controllable-LPMoE范式通过动态控制局部先验有效增强细粒度感知，实现了高效微调，在分割任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models provide powerful feature representations for
downstream object segmentation tasks. However, when adapted to specific tasks
through the full-parameter fine-tuning, the enormous parameters being updated
often results in significant computational overhead, creating a bottleneck in
training efficiency. Although existing methods attempt to fine-tune frozen
models by directly embedding trainable prompts, these prompts lack inherent
semantic priors, limiting the adaptability of large-scale models. In this
paper, we propose a novel dynamic priors-based fine-tuning paradigm with fewer
trainable parameters, dubbed Controllable-LPMoE, which adaptively modulates
frozen foundation models by dynamically controlling local priors to enhance
fine-grained perception for specific segmentation tasks. More specifically, we
construct a lightweight dynamic mixed local priors extractor that captures
diverse local priors from input images through heterogeneous convolutions while
employing a gating network to dynamically output expert priors required for the
subsequent fine-tuning. Furthermore, we design a bi-directional interaction
adapter that employs cosine-aligned deformable attention and channel-oriented
adaptive scale enhancement to interact and restructure between frozen and
trainable features, achieving efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our
\href{https://github.com/CSYSI/Controllable-LPMoE} {Controllable-LPMoE}
approach, demonstrating excellent segmentation performance compared to 31
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and adaptability to multiple binary object
segmentation tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了SafetyPairs框架，通过生成仅安全相关特征不同的图像对来系统研究图像安全问题，构建了包含3020张图像的新安全基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像安全数据集粗糙模糊，仅提供宽泛的安全标签，无法隔离驱动安全差异的具体特征，难以系统区分良性图像和问题图像。

Method: 利用图像编辑模型对图像进行针对性修改，仅改变与安全策略相关的特征，从而翻转安全标签，同时保持安全无关细节不变。

Result: 构建了包含3020个SafetyPair图像的新安全基准，涵盖9个安全类别，能够有效评估视觉语言模型区分细微图像差异的能力，并作为数据增强策略提升轻量级防护模型的训练效率。

Conclusion: SafetyPairs框架为研究细粒度图像安全差异提供了首个系统资源，既能作为强大的评估数据源，又能有效提升模型训练效率。

Abstract: What exactly makes a particular image unsafe? Systematically differentiating
between benign and problematic images is a challenging problem, as subtle
changes to an image, such as an insulting gesture or symbol, can drastically
alter its safety implications. However, existing image safety datasets are
coarse and ambiguous, offering only broad safety labels without isolating the
specific features that drive these differences. We introduce SafetyPairs, a
scalable framework for generating counterfactual pairs of images, that differ
only in the features relevant to the given safety policy, thus flipping their
safety label. By leveraging image editing models, we make targeted changes to
images that alter their safety labels while leaving safety-irrelevant details
unchanged. Using SafetyPairs, we construct a new safety benchmark, which serves
as a powerful source of evaluation data that highlights weaknesses in
vision-language models' abilities to distinguish between subtly different
images. Beyond evaluation, we find our pipeline serves as an effective data
augmentation strategy that improves the sample efficiency of training
lightweight guard models. We release a benchmark containing over 3,020
SafetyPair images spanning a diverse taxonomy of 9 safety categories, providing
the first systematic resource for studying fine-grained image safety
distinctions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习框架在提升通用链式推理能力时，往往难以泛化到训练分布之外，需要解决泛化性不足的问题。

Method: 使用噪声注入探索策略（在视觉输入中添加高斯噪声）和贝叶斯优势估计（将优势估计建模为贝叶斯推理问题，融合噪声先验和轨迹奖励似然）。

Result: 在标准CoT质量、通用能力和幻觉基准测试中，NoisyGRPO显著提升了泛化性和鲁棒性，特别是在小规模MLLMs（如Qwen2.5-VL 3B）的RL设置中表现优异。

Conclusion: NoisyGRPO通过系统性多模态RL框架有效提升了MLLMs的链式推理能力，解决了现有RL方法泛化性不足的问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in enhancing the general
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). However, when applied to improve general CoT reasoning,
existing RL frameworks often struggle to generalize beyond the training
distribution. To address this, we propose NoisyGRPO, a systematic multimodal RL
framework that introduces controllable noise into visual inputs for enhanced
exploration and explicitly models the advantage estimation process via a
Bayesian framework. Specifically, NoisyGRPO improves RL training by: (1)
\textbf{Noise-Injected Exploration Policy}: Perturbing visual inputs with
Gaussian noise to encourage exploration across a wider range of visual
scenarios; and (2) \textbf{Bayesian Advantage Estimation}: Formulating
advantage estimation as a principled Bayesian inference problem, where the
injected noise level serves as a prior and the observed trajectory reward as
the likelihood. This Bayesian modeling fuses both sources of information to
compute a robust posterior estimate of trajectory advantage, effectively
guiding MLLMs to prefer visually grounded trajectories over noisy ones.
Experiments on standard CoT quality, general capability, and hallucination
benchmarks demonstrate that NoisyGRPO substantially improves generalization and
robustness, especially in RL settings with small-scale MLLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL
3B. The project page is available at

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于CycleGAN的级联合成器方法，可以从非对比CT扫描生成数字对比CTPA图像，避免了碘对比剂的风险，并在血管增强和下游临床任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CTPA是诊断肺血管疾病的金标准，但依赖碘对比剂会带来肾毒性和过敏反应风险，特别是对高危患者。本研究旨在开发一种无需对比剂的方法来生成类似CTPA的图像。

Method: 使用基于Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN)的级联合成器，从非对比CT扫描生成数字对比CTPA图像。研究使用了来自三个中心的410对CTPA和NCCT扫描数据，其中249对用于训练和验证，161对作为测试集。

Result: 与现有方法相比，该方法在定量指标上表现最佳（验证集：MAE 156.28，PSNR 20.71，SSIM 0.98；测试集：MAE 165.12，PSNR 20.27，SSIM 0.98）。在下游任务中，肺血管分割的Dice、clDice和clRecall指标分别为0.70、0.71、0.73（动脉）和0.70、0.72、0.75（静脉），血管体积的ICC从0.70提升到0.81。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效生成数字对比CTPA图像，提供有效的血管增强，特别是在小血管方面，为高危患者提供了无对比剂的诊断替代方案。

Abstract: Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) is the reference standard
for diagnosing pulmonary vascular diseases such as Pulmonary Embolism (PE) and
Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH). However, its reliance on
iodinated contrast agents poses risks including nephrotoxicity and allergic
reactions, particularly in high-risk patients. This study proposes a method to
generate Digital Contrast CTPA (DCCTPA) from Non-Contrast CT (NCCT) scans using
a cascaded synthesizer based on Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial
Networks (CycleGAN). Totally retrospective 410 paired CTPA and NCCT scans were
obtained from three centers. The model was trained and validated internally on
249 paired images. Extra dataset that comprising 161 paired images was as test
set for model generalization evaluation and downstream clinical tasks
validation. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, the proposed method
achieved the best comprehensive performance by evaluating quantitative metrics
(For validation, MAE: 156.28, PSNR: 20.71 and SSIM: 0.98; For test, MAE:
165.12, PSNR: 20.27 and SSIM: 0.98) and qualitative visualization,
demonstrating valid vessel enhancement, superior image fidelity and structural
preservation. The approach was further applied to downstream tasks of pulmonary
vessel segmentation and vascular quantification. On the test set, the average
Dice, clDice, and clRecall of artery and vein pulmonary segmentation was 0.70,
0.71, 0.73 and 0.70, 0.72, 0.75 respectively, all markedly improved compared
with NCCT inputs.\@ Inter-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for vessel volume
between DCCTPA and CTPA was significantly better than that between NCCT and
CTPA (Average ICC : 0.81 vs 0.70), indicating effective vascular enhancement in
DCCTPA, especially for small vessels.

TL;DR: 提出了Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG)框架，用于在基础模型中显式编码空间关系，并开发了SIGBench基准来评估视觉空间智能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基础模型中的视觉空间智能评估主要依赖文本提示和VQA评分，这掩盖了几何信息、引入了语言捷径，难以准确评估真正的空间能力。

Method: 引入结构化、基于网格的SIG模式，显式编码物体布局、物体间关系和物理先验知识，作为文本的补充通道。

Result: 在少样本学习中，SIG相比纯VQA表示在所有VSI指标上都获得了更大、更稳定、更全面的提升。

Conclusion: SIG作为数据标注和训练模式，在学习和评估视觉空间智能方面具有重要潜力。

Abstract: How to integrate and verify spatial intelligence in foundation models remains
an open challenge. Current practice often proxies Visual-Spatial Intelligence
(VSI) with purely textual prompts and VQA-style scoring, which obscures
geometry, invites linguistic shortcuts, and weakens attribution to genuinely
spatial skills. We introduce Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG): a structured,
grid-based schema that explicitly encodes object layouts, inter-object
relations, and physically grounded priors. As a complementary channel to text,
SIG provides a faithful, compositional representation of scene structure for
foundation-model reasoning. Building on SIG, we derive SIG-informed evaluation
metrics that quantify a model's intrinsic VSI, which separates spatial
capability from language priors. In few-shot in-context learning with
state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs (e.g. GPT- and Gemini-family models), SIG
yields consistently larger, more stable, and more comprehensive gains across
all VSI metrics compared to VQA-only representations, indicating its promise as
a data-labeling and training schema for learning VSI. We also release SIGBench,
a benchmark of 1.4K driving frames annotated with ground-truth SIG labels and
human gaze traces, supporting both grid-based machine VSI tasks and
attention-driven, human-like VSI tasks in autonomous-driving scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Flow Matching模型使用单一大型网络学习从噪声到数据的整个生成轨迹，难以同时捕捉不同时间步的独特信号特征，且推理成本高昂。

Method: 采用分块设计，将生成轨迹划分为多个时间段，每个段由专门的较小速度块建模；引入语义特征引导模块，使速度块基于预训练表示的语义丰富特征；提出轻量级特征残差近似策略。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256上的实验表明，BFM在保持相当生成性能的同时，实现了2.1倍到4.9倍的推理复杂度加速。

Conclusion: BFM框架在Flow Matching方法中建立了显著改进的帕累托前沿，在推理效率和生成质量方面都取得了优势。

Abstract: Recently, Flow Matching models have pushed the boundaries of high-fidelity
data generation across a wide range of domains. It typically employs a single
large network to learn the entire generative trajectory from noise to data.
Despite their effectiveness, this design struggles to capture distinct signal
characteristics across timesteps simultaneously and incurs substantial
inference costs due to the iterative evaluation of the entire model. To address
these limitations, we propose Blockwise Flow Matching (BFM), a novel framework
that partitions the generative trajectory into multiple temporal segments, each
modeled by smaller but specialized velocity blocks. This blockwise design
enables each block to specialize effectively in its designated interval,
improving inference efficiency and sample quality. To further enhance
generation fidelity, we introduce a Semantic Feature Guidance module that
explicitly conditions velocity blocks on semantically rich features aligned
with pretrained representations. Additionally, we propose a lightweight Feature
Residual Approximation strategy that preserves semantic quality while
significantly reducing inference cost. Extensive experiments on ImageNet
256x256 demonstrate that BFM establishes a substantially improved Pareto
frontier over existing Flow Matching methods, achieving 2.1x to 4.9x
accelerations in inference complexity at comparable generation performance.

TL;DR: TokenCLIP是一个基于CLIP的零样本异常检测框架，通过动态对齐视觉标记和可学习文本子空间来实现细粒度异常学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常使用单一文本空间来对齐不同对象和领域的视觉语义，这种不加区分的对齐方式阻碍了模型准确捕捉多样化的异常语义。

Method: 将标记无关的文本空间扩展为一组正交子空间，通过最优传输问题动态分配每个标记到语义相关的子空间组合，并应用top-k掩码来稀疏化传输计划。

Result: 大量实验证明了TokenCLIP的优越性能。

Conclusion: TokenCLIP通过动态标记级对齐机制，有效提升了零样本异常检测的准确性和细粒度学习能力。

Abstract: Adapting CLIP for anomaly detection on unseen objects has shown strong
potential in a zero-shot manner. However, existing methods typically rely on a
single textual space to align with visual semantics across diverse objects and
domains. The indiscriminate alignment hinders the model from accurately
capturing varied anomaly semantics. We propose TokenCLIP, a token-wise
adaptation framework that enables dynamic alignment between visual and
learnable textual spaces for fine-grained anomaly learning. Rather than mapping
all visual tokens to a single, token-agnostic textual space, TokenCLIP aligns
each token with a customized textual subspace that represents its visual
characteristics. Explicitly assigning a unique learnable textual space to each
token is computationally intractable and prone to insufficient optimization. We
instead expand the token-agnostic textual space into a set of orthogonal
subspaces, and then dynamically assign each token to a subspace combination
guided by semantic affinity, which jointly supports customized and efficient
token-wise adaptation. To this end, we formulate dynamic alignment as an
optimal transport problem, where all visual tokens in an image are transported
to textual subspaces based on semantic similarity. The transport constraints of
OT ensure sufficient optimization across subspaces and encourage them to focus
on different semantics. Solving the problem yields a transport plan that
adaptively assigns each token to semantically relevant subspaces. A top-k
masking is then applied to sparsify the plan and specialize subspaces for
distinct visual regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
TokenCLIP.

Result: 广泛实验表明KBE缓解了数据污染和饱和风险，提供了更全面的MLLM能力评估。

Conclusion: KBE框架为多模态大语言模型提供了更可靠、动态的评估方法，能够更准确地反映模型真实能力。

Abstract: The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) calls for more
reliable evaluation protocols. Existing static benchmarks suffer from the
potential risk of data contamination and saturation, leading to inflated or
misleading performance evaluations. To address these issues, we first apply
Graph formulation to represent a static or dynamic VQA sample. With the
formulation, we propose Knowledge-enhanced Benchmark Evolution(KBE), a dynamic
multimodal evaluation framework. KBE first analyzes the original static
benchmark, then expands it by integrating multimodal knowledge, transforming
the static benchmark into a controllable, dynamic evolving version. Crucially,
KBE can both reconstruct questions by Re-selecting visual information in the
original image and expand existing questions with external textual knowledge.
It enables difficulty-controllable evaluation by adjusting the degree of
question exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KBE alleviates the
risk of data contamination, data saturation, and provides a more comprehensive
assessment of MLLM capabilities.

TL;DR: 本文提出了iSM框架，系统解决了捷径模型的五个核心问题：复合引导缺陷、固定引导不灵活、频率偏差、自一致性冲突和弯曲流轨迹，显著提升了生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 捷径模型作为一种非对抗性生成模型，支持单步、少步和多步采样，但其广泛应用受到性能瓶颈的限制。本文旨在解决阻碍捷径模型发展的五个关键问题。

Method: 提出了iSM统一训练框架，包含四个关键改进：内在引导提供动态控制，多级小波损失缓解频率偏差，缩放最优传输减少训练方差，双EMA策略平衡训练稳定性与自一致性。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256上的大量实验表明，该方法在单步、少步和多步生成任务上都显著优于基线捷径模型，FID指标得到大幅提升。

Conclusion: iSM框架使捷径模型成为一类可行且具有竞争力的生成模型，解决了长期存在的性能瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Shortcut models represent a promising, non-adversarial paradigm for
generative modeling, uniquely supporting one-step, few-step, and multi-step
sampling from a single trained network. However, their widespread adoption has
been stymied by critical performance bottlenecks. This paper tackles the five
core issues that held shortcut models back: (1) the hidden flaw of compounding
guidance, which we are the first to formalize, causing severe image artifacts;
(2) inflexible fixed guidance that restricts inference-time control; (3) a
pervasive frequency bias driven by a reliance on low-level distances in the
direct domain, which biases reconstructions toward low frequencies; (4)
divergent self-consistency arising from a conflict with EMA training; and (5)
curvy flow trajectories that impede convergence. To address these challenges,
we introduce iSM, a unified training framework that systematically resolves
each limitation. Our framework is built on four key improvements: Intrinsic
Guidance provides explicit, dynamic control over guidance strength, resolving
both compounding guidance and inflexibility. A Multi-Level Wavelet Loss
mitigates frequency bias to restore high-frequency details. Scaling Optimal
Transport (sOT) reduces training variance and learns straighter, more stable
generative paths. Finally, a Twin EMA strategy reconciles training stability
with self-consistency. Extensive experiments on ImageNet 256 x 256 demonstrate
that our approach yields substantial FID improvements over baseline shortcut
models across one-step, few-step, and multi-step generation, making shortcut
models a viable and competitive class of generative models.

TL;DR: TSSR是一种基于离散扩散模型的新方法，用于生成高质量、艺术家风格的3D网格，通过并行生成和解耦训练实现高效控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实现高精度token预测并支持并行生成，相比顺序自回归方法具有显著优势，通过同时观察所有网格token来提升效率和可控性。

Method: 采用解耦训练和混合推理，将生成过程分为拓扑雕刻和形状细化两个阶段；改进的Hourglass架构结合双向注意力和旋转位置嵌入；引入连接损失作为拓扑约束。

Result: 在复杂数据集上的实验表明，TSSR能生成高质量3D艺术家风格网格，支持多达10,000个面，空间分辨率达到1024^3。

Conclusion: TSSR通过并行生成和解耦训练策略，成功实现了高质量3D网格的高效生成，在拓扑细节和整体形状方面都表现出色。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Topology Sculptor, Shape Refiner (TSSR), a novel
method for generating high-quality, artist-style 3D meshes based on Discrete
Diffusion Models (DDMs). Our primary motivation for TSSR is to achieve highly
accurate token prediction while enabling parallel generation, a significant
advantage over sequential autoregressive methods. By allowing TSSR to "see" all
mesh tokens concurrently, we unlock a new level of efficiency and control. We
leverage this parallel generation capability through three key innovations: 1)
Decoupled Training and Hybrid Inference, which distinctly separates the
DDM-based generation into a topology sculpting stage and a subsequent shape
refinement stage. This strategic decoupling enables TSSR to effectively capture
both intricate local topology and overarching global shape. 2) An Improved
Hourglass Architecture, featuring bidirectional attention enriched by
face-vertex-sequence level Rotational Positional Embeddings (RoPE), thereby
capturing richer contextual information across the mesh structure. 3) A novel
Connection Loss, which acts as a topological constraint to further enhance the
realism and fidelity of the generated meshes. Extensive experiments on complex
datasets demonstrate that TSSR generates high-quality 3D artist-style meshes,
capable of achieving up to 10,000 faces at a remarkable spatial resolution of
$1024^3$. The code will be released at:

TL;DR: SAGE-3D将3D高斯泼溅技术升级为可执行的、语义和物理对齐的环境，用于视觉语言导航，包含对象级语义标注和物理感知执行连接。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅技术虽然具有逼真的实时渲染能力，但缺乏细粒度语义和物理可执行性，限制了其在视觉语言导航中的应用。

Method: 提出SAGE-3D框架，包含对象中心语义标注（为3DGS添加对象级细粒度标注）和物理感知执行连接（嵌入碰撞对象并构建丰富的物理接口）。

Result: 发布了InteriorGS数据集（包含1K对象标注的3DGS室内场景数据）和SAGE-Bench基准（首个基于3DGS的VLN基准，包含2M VLN数据）。实验显示3DGS场景数据更难收敛但具有强泛化能力，在VLN-CE Unseen任务上提升基线性能31%。

Conclusion: SAGE-3D成功将3DGS升级为语义和物理对齐的可执行环境，显著提升了视觉语言导航的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a 3D representation method with photorealistic
real-time rendering capabilities, is regarded as an effective tool for
narrowing the sim-to-real gap. However, it lacks fine-grained semantics and
physical executability for Visual-Language Navigation (VLN). To address this,
we propose SAGE-3D (Semantically and Physically Aligned Gaussian Environments
for 3D Navigation), a new paradigm that upgrades 3DGS into an executable,
semantically and physically aligned environment. It comprises two components:
(1) Object-Centric Semantic Grounding, which adds object-level fine-grained
annotations to 3DGS; and (2) Physics-Aware Execution Jointing, which embeds
collision objects into 3DGS and constructs rich physical interfaces. We release
InteriorGS, containing 1K object-annotated 3DGS indoor scene data, and
introduce SAGE-Bench, the first 3DGS-based VLN benchmark with 2M VLN data.
Experiments show that 3DGS scene data is more difficult to converge, while
exhibiting strong generalizability, improving baseline performance by 31% on
the VLN-CE Unseen task. The data and code will be available soon.

Motivation: 由于输入分辨率受限，多模态大语言模型在理解高分辨率图像中的视觉细节和定位极小物体方面面临挑战，特别是在杂乱背景中的超小物体。

Method: 采用两阶段粗到精管道：全局语义探索进行指令引导推理生成文本响应和粗略目标区域，局部感知细化将该区域细化为精确边界框和分割掩码，并引入定位知情回顾奖励来耦合两个阶段。

Result: 在FineRS-4k和公共数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法在指令引导分割和视觉推理任务上持续优于最先进的多模态大语言模型方法。

Conclusion: FineRS框架有效解决了多模态大语言模型在高分辨率图像中处理极小物体的挑战，通过两阶段强化学习方法实现了更好的推理和分割性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities
across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, due to the restricted
input resolutions, MLLMs face significant challenges in precisely understanding
and localizing visual details in high-resolution images -- particularly when
dealing with extra-small objects embedded in cluttered contexts. To address
this issue, we propose \textsc{FineRS}, a two-stage MLLM-based reinforcement
learning framework for jointly reasoning and segmenting extremely small objects
within high-resolution scenes. \textsc{FineRS} adopts a coarse-to-fine pipeline
comprising Global Semantic Exploration (GSE) and Localized Perceptual
Refinement (LPR). Specifically, GSE performs instruction-guided reasoning to
generate a textural response and a coarse target region, while LPR refines this
region to produce an accurate bounding box and segmentation mask. To couple the
two stages, we introduce a locate-informed retrospective reward, where LPR's
outputs are used to optimize GSE for more robust coarse region exploration. %
Additionally, we present \textsc{FineRS}-4k, a new dataset for evaluating MLLMs
on attribute-level reasoning and pixel-level segmentation on subtle,
small-scale targets in complex high-resolution scenes. Experimental results on
\textsc{FineRS}-4k and public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art MLLM-based approaches on both instruction-guided
segmentation and visual reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉-语言模型的多模态对齐组件可解释性不足，难以将多模态表示语义映射到统一概念集。

Method: 构建基于距离的编码器和两个模态特定解码器的VL-SAE，通过余弦相似度显式对齐多模态表示，确保语义相似表示具有一致的神经元激活。

Result: 在多个VLMs（如CLIP、LLaVA）上验证，VL-SAE能有效解释和增强视觉-语言对齐，在零样本图像分类和幻觉消除等下游任务中提升性能。

Conclusion: VL-SAE通过概念级对齐增强了视觉-语言表示的可解释性和性能，为多模态对齐提供了统一的语义解释框架。

Abstract: The alignment of vision-language representations endows current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong multi-modal reasoning capabilities.
However, the interpretability of the alignment component remains uninvestigated
due to the difficulty in mapping the semantics of multi-modal representations
into a unified concept set. To address this problem, we propose VL-SAE, a
sparse autoencoder that encodes vision-language representations into its hidden
activations. Each neuron in its hidden layer correlates to a concept
represented by semantically similar images and texts, thereby interpreting
these representations with a unified concept set. To establish the
neuron-concept correlation, we encourage semantically similar representations
to exhibit consistent neuron activations during self-supervised training.
First, to measure the semantic similarity of multi-modal representations, we
perform their alignment in an explicit form based on cosine similarity. Second,
we construct the VL-SAE with a distance-based encoder and two modality-specific
decoders to ensure the activation consistency of semantically similar
representations. Experiments across multiple VLMs (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA)
demonstrate the superior capability of VL-SAE in interpreting and enhancing the
vision-language alignment. For interpretation, the alignment between vision and
language representations can be understood by comparing their semantics with
concepts. For enhancement, the alignment can be strengthened by aligning
vision-language representations at the concept level, contributing to
performance improvements in downstream tasks, including zero-shot image
classification and hallucination elimination. Codes are available at

Motivation: 当前计算框架仅限于二维表示，无法捕捉细胞形态在扰动下的复杂性，这限制了准确虚拟细胞模型的发展。

Method: FORM包含形态编码器（通过多通道VQGAN端到端训练学习紧凑3D表示）和基于扩散的扰动轨迹模块，在包含65,000多个3D细胞体积的大规模数据集上训练。

Result: FORM支持无条件形态合成和条件模拟扰动细胞状态，能够预测下游信号活动、模拟组合扰动效应，并建模未见扰动的状态间形态动力学转变。

Conclusion: FORM和MorphoEval通过高分辨率预测模拟将形态、扰动和功能联系起来，推动3D虚拟细胞的实现。

Abstract: Understanding how cells respond to external stimuli is a central challenge in
biomedical research and drug development. Current computational frameworks for
modelling cellular responses remain restricted to two-dimensional
representations, limiting their capacity to capture the complexity of cell
morphology under perturbation. This dimensional constraint poses a critical
bottleneck for the development of accurate virtual cell models. Here, we
present FORM, a machine learning framework for predicting perturbation-induced
changes in three-dimensional cellular structure. FORM consists of two
components: a morphology encoder, trained end-to-end via a novel multi-channel
VQGAN to learn compact 3D representations of cell shape, and a diffusion-based
perturbation trajectory module that captures how morphology evolves across
perturbation conditions. Trained on a large-scale dataset of over 65,000
multi-fluorescence 3D cell volumes spanning diverse chemical and genetic
perturbations, FORM supports both unconditional morphology synthesis and
conditional simulation of perturbed cell states. Beyond generation, FORM can
predict downstream signalling activity, simulate combinatorial perturbation
effects, and model morphodynamic transitions between states of unseen
perturbations. To evaluate performance, we introduce MorphoEval, a benchmarking
suite that quantifies perturbation-induced morphological changes in structural,
statistical, and biological dimensions. Together, FORM and MorphoEval work
toward the realisation of the 3D virtual cell by linking morphology,
perturbation, and function through high-resolution predictive simulation.

TL;DR: 提出CNN-Transformer-CLIP（CT-CLIP）多分支识别框架，结合CNN提取局部病变特征和Vision Transformer捕获全局结构关系，通过自适应特征融合模块动态融合特征，解决苹果叶病病变形态多样性的识别问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多尺度特征融合方法在复杂果园环境中，面对苹果叶病病变表型异质性（病变间显著变异）时，仅整合CNN提取的多层特征，未能充分考虑局部与全局特征间的关系。

Method: 1. 多分支框架：CNN提取局部病变细节特征，Vision Transformer捕获全局结构关系；2. 自适应特征融合模块（AFFM）动态融合特征；3. 多模态图像-文本学习方法，利用预训练CLIP权重实现视觉特征与疾病语义描述的深度对齐。

Conclusion: CT-CLIP在农业病害识别方面表现出强大能力，显著提升了复杂环境条件下的识别准确率，为农业应用中的自动化病害识别提供了创新实用的解决方案。

Abstract: In complex orchard environments, the phenotypic heterogeneity of different
apple leaf diseases, characterized by significant variation among lesions,
poses a challenge to traditional multi-scale feature fusion methods. These
methods only integrate multi-layer features extracted by convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and fail to adequately account for the relationships between
local and global features. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-branch
recognition framework named CNN-Transformer-CLIP (CT-CLIP). The framework
synergistically employs a CNN to extract local lesion detail features and a
Vision Transformer to capture global structural relationships. An Adaptive
Feature Fusion Module (AFFM) then dynamically fuses these features, achieving
optimal coupling of local and global information and effectively addressing the
diversity in lesion morphology and distribution. Additionally, to mitigate
interference from complex backgrounds and significantly enhance recognition
accuracy under few-shot conditions, this study proposes a multimodal image-text
learning approach. By leveraging pre-trained CLIP weights, it achieves deep
alignment between visual features and disease semantic descriptions.
Experimental results show that CT-CLIP achieves accuracies of 97.38% and 96.12%
on a publicly available apple disease and a self-built dataset, outperforming
several baseline methods. The proposed CT-CLIP demonstrates strong capabilities
in recognizing agricultural diseases, significantly enhances identification
accuracy under complex environmental conditions, provides an innovative and
practical solution for automated disease recognition in agricultural
applications.

Motivation: 现有无人机跟踪方法主要关注速度而缺乏语义感知探索，导致在相机运动、快速运动和低分辨率等典型挑战下性能不佳。

Method: 采用动态语义相关性生成器结合Transformer相关图探索语义相关性，增强搜索区域从模板中提取重要信息的能力，并设计剪枝方法提升跟踪速度。

Result: 在多个无人机跟踪数据集上验证了方法的有效性，取得了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过语义感知提升了无人机跟踪的准确性和鲁棒性，同时提供速度与精度的灵活权衡，适用于不同计算资源场景。

Abstract: UAV tracking can be widely applied in scenarios such as disaster rescue,
environmental monitoring, and logistics transportation. However, existing UAV
tracking methods predominantly emphasize speed and lack exploration in semantic
awareness, which hinders the search region from extracting accurate
localization information from the template. The limitation results in
suboptimal performance under typical UAV tracking challenges such as camera
motion, fast motion, and low resolution, etc. To address this issue, we propose
a dynamic semantic aware correlation modeling tracking framework. The core of
our framework is a Dynamic Semantic Relevance Generator, which, in combination
with the correlation map from the Transformer, explore semantic relevance. The
approach enhances the search region's ability to extract important information
from the template, improving accuracy and robustness under the aforementioned
challenges. Additionally, to enhance the tracking speed, we design a pruning
method for the proposed framework. Therefore, we present multiple model
variants that achieve trade-offs between speed and accuracy, enabling flexible
deployment according to the available computational resources. Experimental
results validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving competitive
performance on multiple UAV tracking datasets. The code is available at

Conclusion: 这项工作为在现实场景中使用人类注视增强VLM的预测能力奠定了基础，如辅助机器人和人机协作应用。

Abstract: Eye gaze offers valuable cues about attention, short-term intent, and future
actions, making it a powerful signal for modeling egocentric behavior. In this
work, we propose a gaze-regularized framework that enhances VLMs for two key
egocentric understanding tasks: fine-grained future event prediction and
current activity understanding. Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on
visual inputs or use gaze as an auxiliary input signal , our method uses gaze
only during training. We introduce a gaze-regularized attention mechanism that
aligns model focus with human visual gaze. This design is flexible and modular,
allowing it to generalize across multiple VLM architectures that utilize
attention. Experimental results show that our approach improves semantic
prediction scores by up to 11 for future event prediction and around 7 for
current activity understanding, compared to the corresponding baseline models
trained without gaze regularization. These results highlight the value of
gaze-guided training in improving the accuracy and robustness of egocentric
VLMs. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for using human gaze to
enhance the predictive capabilities of VLMs in real-world scenarios like
assistive robots and human-machine collaboration. Code and additional

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的合成CT生成管道，使用2.5D U-Net++架构和IMPACT-Synth感知损失，在SynthRAD2025挑战赛中评估了两种配准策略，发现基于IMPACT的配准能提供更准确的解剖对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统基于互信息的配准方法在合成CT生成中可能引入的解剖不一致性问题，开发更稳健和可泛化的合成CT合成模型。

Method: 使用2.5D U-Net++架构，ResNet-34编码器，联合训练各解剖区域并进行区域微调。损失函数结合像素级L1损失和基于SAM与TotalSegmentator的IMPACT-Synth感知损失。评估了Elastix（互信息）和IMPACT（基于特征的相似性度量）两种配准策略。

Result: 在本地测试集上，基于IMPACT的配准实现了更准确和一致的解剖对齐，降低了MAE并产生更真实的解剖结构。但在公共验证集上，使用Elastix配准数据的模型得分更高，反映了与评估管道一致的配准偏差。

Conclusion: 配准误差会传播到监督学习中，影响训练和评估，可能以牺牲解剖保真度为代价来提升性能指标。IMPACT通过促进解剖一致性对齐有助于减轻这种偏差，支持开发更稳健的合成CT合成模型。

Abstract: We participated in the SynthRAD2025 challenge (Tasks 1 and 2) with a unified
pipeline for synthetic CT (sCT) generation from MRI and CBCT, implemented using
the KonfAI framework. Our model is a 2.5D U-Net++ with a ResNet-34 encoder,
trained jointly across anatomical regions and fine-tuned per region. The loss
function combined pixel-wise L1 loss with IMPACT-Synth, a perceptual loss
derived from SAM and TotalSegmentator to enhance structural fidelity. Training
was performed using AdamW (initial learning rate = 0.001, halved every 25k
steps) on patch-based, normalized, body-masked inputs (320x320 for MRI, 256x256
for CBCT), with random flipping as the only augmentation. No post-processing
was applied. Final predictions leveraged test-time augmentation and five-fold
ensembling. The best model was selected based on validation MAE. Two
registration strategies were evaluated: (i) Elastix with mutual information,
consistent with the challenge pipeline, and (ii) IMPACT, a feature-based
similarity metric leveraging pretrained segmentation networks. On the local
test sets, IMPACT-based registration achieved more accurate and anatomically
consistent alignments than mutual-information-based registration, resulting in
improved sCT synthesis with lower MAE and more realistic anatomical structures.
On the public validation set, however, models trained with Elastix-aligned data
achieved higher scores, reflecting a registration bias favoring alignment
strategies consistent with the evaluation pipeline. This highlights how
registration errors can propagate into supervised learning, influencing both
training and evaluation, and potentially inflating performance metrics at the
expense of anatomical fidelity. By promoting anatomically consistent alignment,
IMPACT helps mitigate this bias and supports the development of more robust and
generalizable sCT synthesis models.

Motivation: 传统扩散模型采用固定步数的去噪过程，不考虑下游传输限制。在实际云到设备场景中，有限带宽需要重度压缩，导致纹理细节丢失和计算浪费。

Method: 引入联合端到端训练策略，扩散模型以从可用带宽得出的目标质量级别为条件。模型学习自适应调制去噪过程，使用轻量级质量嵌入指导去噪轨迹，实现早期停止采样。

Result: 实验结果表明，与简单的早期停止相比，该方法显著提高了带宽自适应生成的视觉保真度。

Conclusion: 该方法为带宽受限环境中的高效图像传输提供了有前景的解决方案，只需最小的架构改动。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enable diffusion models to
adapt their generation quality based on real-time network bandwidth
constraints. Traditional diffusion models produce high-fidelity images by
performing a fixed number of denoising steps, regardless of downstream
transmission limitations. However, in practical cloud-to-device scenarios,
limited bandwidth often necessitates heavy compression, leading to loss of fine
textures and wasted computation. To address this, we introduce a joint
end-to-end training strategy where the diffusion model is conditioned on a
target quality level derived from the available bandwidth. During training, the
model learns to adaptively modulate the denoising process, enabling early-stop
sampling that maintains perceptual quality appropriate to the target
transmission condition. Our method requires minimal architectural changes and
leverages a lightweight quality embedding to guide the denoising trajectory.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the
visual fidelity of bandwidth-adapted generations compared to naive
early-stopping, offering a promising solution for efficient image delivery in
bandwidth-constrained environments. Code is available at:

Conclusion: TerraGen展示了在完整数据和少样本场景下的强大跨任务泛化能力，为遥感视觉任务提供了有效的统一生成解决方案。

Abstract: Remote sensing vision tasks require extensive labeled data across multiple,
interconnected domains. However, current generative data augmentation
frameworks are task-isolated, i.e., each vision task requires training an
independent generative model, and ignores the modeling of geographical
information and spatial constraints. To address these issues, we propose
\textbf{TerraGen}, a unified layout-to-image generation framework that enables
flexible, spatially controllable synthesis of remote sensing imagery for
various high-level vision tasks, e.g., detection, segmentation, and extraction.
Specifically, TerraGen introduces a geographic-spatial layout encoder that
unifies bounding box and segmentation mask inputs, combined with a multi-scale
injection scheme and mask-weighted loss to explicitly encode spatial
constraints, from global structures to fine details. Also, we construct the
first large-scale multi-task remote sensing layout generation dataset
containing 45k images and establish a standardized evaluation protocol for this
task. Experimental results show that our TerraGen can achieve the best
generation image quality across diverse tasks. Additionally, TerraGen can be
used as a universal data-augmentation generator, enhancing downstream task
performance significantly and demonstrating robust cross-task generalisation in
both full-data and few-shot scenarios.

Abstract: Image stitching synthesizes images captured from multiple perspectives into a
single image with a broader field of view. The significant variations in object
depth often lead to large parallax, resulting in ghosting and misalignment in
the stitched results. To address this, we propose a
depth-consistency-constrained seamless-free image stitching method. First, to
tackle the multi-view alignment difficulties caused by parallax, a multi-stage
mechanism combined with global depth regularization constraints is developed to
enhance the alignment accuracy of the same apparent target across different
depth ranges. Second, during the multi-view image fusion process, an optimal
stitching seam is determined through graph-based low-cost computation, and a
soft-seam region is diffused to precisely locate transition areas, thereby
effectively mitigating alignment errors induced by parallax and achieving
natural and seamless stitching results. Furthermore, considering the
computational overhead in the shift regression process, a reparameterization
strategy is incorporated to optimize the structural design, significantly
improving algorithm efficiency while maintaining optimal performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method against
the existing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/DLUT-YRH/DSFN.

TL;DR: 提出了多模态未修剪视频检索任务(MUVR)，这是一个针对长视频平台的新基准，支持视频中心的多模态查询，包含53K个未修剪视频和1,050个多模态查询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为长视频平台开发实用的视频检索系统，解决现有方法在处理未修剪视频和多模态查询时的局限性。

Method: 构建MUVR基准，包含三个版本(Base、Filter、QA)，支持视频标签提示、掩码提示等多模态查询，定义了六个级别的视觉对应关系，并提出重排序评分来评估MLLMs。

Result: 对3个最先进的视频检索模型、6个基于图像的VLM和10个MLLMs进行了广泛评估，揭示了这些方法在未修剪视频处理和多模态查询方面的局限性。

Conclusion: MUVR基准为长视频平台的多模态视频检索提供了实用的评估框架，揭示了现有方法的不足，并推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: We propose the Multi-modal Untrimmed Video Retrieval task, along with a new
benchmark (MUVR) to advance video retrieval for long-video platforms. MUVR aims
to retrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant segments using multi-modal
queries. It has the following features: 1) Practical retrieval paradigm: MUVR
supports video-centric multi-modal queries, expressing fine-grained retrieval
needs through long text descriptions, video tag prompts, and mask prompts. It
adopts a one-to-many retrieval paradigm and focuses on untrimmed videos,
tailored for long-video platform applications. 2) Multi-level visual
correspondence: To cover common video categories (e.g., news, travel, dance)
and precisely define retrieval matching criteria, we construct multi-level
visual correspondence based on core video content (e.g., news events, travel
locations, dance moves) which users are interested in and want to retrieve. It
covers six levels: copy, event, scene, instance, action, and others. 3)
Comprehensive evaluation criteria: We develop 3 versions of MUVR (i.e., Base,
Filter, QA). MUVR-Base/Filter evaluates retrieval models, while MUVR-QA
assesses MLLMs in a question-answering format. We also propose a Reranking
Score to evaluate the reranking ability of MLLMs. MUVR consists of 53K
untrimmed videos from the video platform Bilibili, with 1,050 multi-modal
queries and 84K matches. Extensive evaluations of 3 state-of-the-art video
retrieval models, 6 image-based VLMs, and 10 MLLMs are conducted. MUVR reveals
the limitations of retrieval methods in processing untrimmed videos and
multi-modal queries, as well as MLLMs in multi-video understanding and
reranking. Our code and benchmark is available at
https://github.com/debby-0527/MUVR.

TL;DR: 提出了一个可扩展的框架，能够自适应地识别图像相关概念轴并在真实场景中沿这些轴进行视觉概念学习，无需预定义概念类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅限于预定义的原始轴（如颜色、形状），且通常在合成数据集中探索，无法处理真实世界中丰富多样的语义维度。

Method: 利用预训练的视觉语言模型和通用提示策略识别多样化的图像相关轴，通过通用概念编码器自适应地将视觉特征绑定到发现轴上，使用组合锚定目标确保各轴可独立操作。

Result: 在ImageNet、CelebA-HQ和AFHQ数据集上展示了卓越的编辑能力，能够处理过于多样化而无法手动预定义的真实世界概念，并表现出强大的组合泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法在视觉概念学习和基于文本的编辑方法中表现优异，为语言引导的视觉概念学习提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Human intelligence effortlessly interprets visual scenes along a rich
spectrum of semantic dimensions. However, existing approaches to
language-grounded visual concept learning are limited to a few predefined
primitive axes, such as color and shape, and are typically explored in
synthetic datasets. In this work, we propose a scalable framework that
adaptively identifies image-related concept axes and grounds visual concepts
along these axes in real-world scenes. Leveraging a pretrained vision-language
model and our universal prompting strategy, our framework identifies a diverse
image-related axes without any prior knowledge. Our universal concept encoder
adaptively binds visual features to the discovered axes without introducing
additional model parameters for each concept. To ground visual concepts along
the discovered axes, we optimize a compositional anchoring objective, which
ensures that each axis can be independently manipulated without affecting
others. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on subsets of
ImageNet, CelebA-HQ, and AFHQ, showcasing superior editing capabilities across
diverse real-world concepts that are too varied to be manually predefined. Our
method also exhibits strong compositional generalization, outperforming
existing visual concept learning and text-based editing methods. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以同时实现精细几何、准确铰接和逼真外观的3D物体生成，特别是在处理铰接依赖的可见性变化时存在挑战。

Method: 使用变分自编码器将稀疏体素表示和铰接属性嵌入统一潜在空间，然后训练潜在扩散模型进行多样化采样，并引入铰接感知的高斯解码器重建逼真3D形状。

Result: 在PartNet-Mobility和ACD数据集上的实验表明，ArtiLatent在几何一致性和外观保真度方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为铰接3D物体合成和操作提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose ArtiLatent, a generative framework that synthesizes human-made 3D
objects with fine-grained geometry, accurate articulation, and realistic
appearance. Our approach jointly models part geometry and articulation dynamics
by embedding sparse voxel representations and associated articulation
properties, including joint type, axis, origin, range, and part category, into
a unified latent space via a variational autoencoder. A latent diffusion model
is then trained over this space to enable diverse yet physically plausible
sampling. To reconstruct photorealistic 3D shapes, we introduce an
articulation-aware Gaussian decoder that accounts for articulation-dependent
visibility changes (e.g., revealing the interior of a drawer when opened). By
conditioning appearance decoding on articulation state, our method assigns
plausible texture features to regions that are typically occluded in static
poses, significantly improving visual realism across articulation
configurations. Extensive experiments on furniture-like objects from
PartNet-Mobility and ACD datasets demonstrate that ArtiLatent outperforms
existing approaches in geometric consistency and appearance fidelity. Our
framework provides a scalable solution for articulated 3D object synthesis and
manipulation.

### [43] [Anisotropic Pooling for LUT-realizable CNN Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21437)
*Xi Zhang,Xiaolin Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种各向异性池化策略来改进基于查找表（LUT）的图像恢复CNN方法，通过广义中值池化和学习数据依赖的池化系数来替代简单的平均池化，从而更好地处理各向异性信号结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于查找表的CNN图像恢复方法使用平均池化来融合不同方向的像素块结果，但这种方法不适合处理各向异性信号结构，限制了性能提升。

Method: 首先引入广义中值池化方法，然后扩展为学习数据依赖的池化系数，使不同方向的像素块贡献能够自适应加权。

Result: 在各种恢复基准测试上的实验结果表明，该各向异性池化策略在感知质量和数值指标上都优于现有的LUT可实现的CNN方法。

Conclusion: 各向异性池化策略能够有效提升基于查找表的图像恢复CNN方法的性能，特别是在处理各向异性信号结构时表现更优。

Abstract: Table look-up realization of image restoration CNNs has the potential of
achieving competitive image quality while being much faster and resource frugal
than the straightforward CNN implementation. The main technical challenge
facing the LUT-based CNN algorithm designers is to manage the table size
without overly restricting the receptive field. The prevailing strategy is to
reuse the table for small pixel patches of different orientations (apparently
assuming a degree of isotropy) and then fuse the look-up results. The fusion is
currently done by average pooling, which we find being ill suited to
anisotropic signal structures. To alleviate the problem, we investigate and
discuss anisotropic pooling methods to replace naive averaging for improving
the performance of the current LUT-realizable CNN restoration methods. First,
we introduce the method of generalized median pooling which leads to measurable
gains over average pooling. We then extend this idea by learning data-dependent
pooling coefficients for each orientation, so that they can adaptively weigh
the contributions of differently oriented pixel patches. Experimental results
on various restoration benchmarks show that our anisotropic pooling strategy
yields both perceptually and numerically superior results compared to existing
LUT-realizable CNN methods.

TL;DR: OpenHype提出了一种使用双曲潜在空间表示3D场景层次结构的新方法，解决了现有方法在推理时间和泛化能力方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在建模3D对象和场景的层次结构时存在显著限制：要么需要多次渲染导致推理时间增加，要么依赖预定义的离散层次结构，在真实世界的多样结构上泛化能力差。

Method: 利用双曲几何的特性，在连续的双曲潜在空间中表示场景层次结构，自然地编码多尺度关系，并通过潜在空间中的测地线路径实现层次结构的平滑遍历。

Result: 在标准基准测试中优于最先进的方法，在3D场景理解方面表现出更高的效率和适应性。

Conclusion: OpenHype通过双曲潜在空间有效解决了3D场景层次结构建模的挑战，为自主代理提供了更全面的环境理解能力。

Abstract: Modeling the inherent hierarchical structure of 3D objects and 3D scenes is
highly desirable, as it enables a more holistic understanding of environments
for autonomous agents. Accomplishing this with implicit representations, such
as Neural Radiance Fields, remains an unexplored challenge. Existing methods
that explicitly model hierarchical structures often face significant
limitations: they either require multiple rendering passes to capture
embeddings at different levels of granularity, significantly increasing
inference time, or rely on predefined, closed-set discrete hierarchies that
generalize poorly to the diverse and nuanced structures encountered by agents
in the real world. To address these challenges, we propose OpenHype, a novel
approach that represents scene hierarchies using a continuous hyperbolic latent
space. By leveraging the properties of hyperbolic geometry, OpenHype naturally
encodes multi-scale relationships and enables smooth traversal of hierarchies
through geodesic paths in latent space. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on standard benchmarks, demonstrating superior efficiency and
adaptability in 3D scene understanding.

Conclusion: PhysWorld通过模拟器合成演示有效解决了数据稀缺问题，为学习物理一致的世界模型提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Interactive world models that simulate object dynamics are crucial for
robotics, VR, and AR. However, it remains a significant challenge to learn
physics-consistent dynamics models from limited real-world video data,
especially for deformable objects with spatially-varying physical properties.
To overcome the challenge of data scarcity, we propose PhysWorld, a novel
framework that utilizes a simulator to synthesize physically plausible and
diverse demonstrations to learn efficient world models. Specifically, we first
construct a physics-consistent digital twin within MPM simulator via
constitutive model selection and global-to-local optimization of physical
properties. Subsequently, we apply part-aware perturbations to the physical
properties and generate various motion patterns for the digital twin,
synthesizing extensive and diverse demonstrations. Finally, using these
demonstrations, we train a lightweight GNN-based world model that is embedded
with physical properties. The real video can be used to further refine the
physical properties. PhysWorld achieves accurate and fast future predictions
for various deformable objects, and also generalizes well to novel
interactions. Experiments show that PhysWorld has competitive performance while
enabling inference speeds 47 times faster than the recent state-of-the-art
method, i.e., PhysTwin.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MoniTor方法，基于预训练视觉语言模型和记忆机制实现无需训练的在线视频异常检测，在UCF-Crime和XD-Violence数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在线视频异常检测（VAD）面临的实时性约束和计算强度问题，现有研究主要关注离线VAD而在线VAD很少受到关注。

Method: 使用流式输入到视觉语言模型，结合LSTM启发的预测机制捕获时间依赖，设计评分队列和异常先验动态存储最近分数，为LLM区分正常和异常行为提供指导。

Result: 在两个大型数据集（UCF-Crime和XD-Violence）上评估，MoniTor优于最先进方法，且无需训练即可与弱监督方法竞争。

Conclusion: MoniTor为在线视频异常检测提供了一种有效的无需训练解决方案，通过记忆机制和动态评分系统成功处理了实时检测的挑战。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to locate unusual activities or behaviors
within videos. Recently, offline VAD has garnered substantial research
attention, which has been invigorated by the progress in large language models
(LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), offering the potential for a more
nuanced understanding of anomalies. However, online VAD has seldom received
attention due to real-time constraints and computational intensity. In this
paper, we introduce a novel Memory-based online scoring queue scheme for
Training-free VAD (MoniTor), to address the inherent complexities in online
VAD. Specifically, MoniTor applies a streaming input to VLMs, leveraging the
capabilities of pre-trained large-scale models. To capture temporal
dependencies more effectively, we incorporate a novel prediction mechanism
inspired by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This ensures the model can
effectively model past states and leverage previous predictions to identify
anomalous behaviors. Thereby, it better understands the current frame.
Moreover, we design a scoring queue and an anomaly prior to dynamically store
recent scores and cover all anomalies in the monitoring scenario, providing
guidance for LLMs to distinguish between normal and abnormal behaviors over
time. We evaluate MoniTor on two large datasets (i.e., UCF-Crime and
XD-Violence) containing various surveillance and real-world scenarios. The
results demonstrate that MoniTor outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is
competitive with weakly supervised methods without training. Code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频修复方法在严重内容退化情况下表现不佳，且忽视时空稳定性，导致对视频后半部分控制不足。

Method: 将视频修复解耦为两个子任务，设计CoSpliced模块进行首帧传播策略，通过拼接机制扩散初始帧内容，并引入上下文控制器模块注入拼接视频到I2V生成主干中。

Result: 在多样化视频修复场景中取得竞争性表现，显著提升前景对齐和运动稳定性，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VidSplice通过解耦策略和时空先验的有效结合，解决了视频修复中的时空一致性问题，为复杂场景下的视频修复提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent video inpainting methods often employ image-to-video (I2V) priors to
model temporal consistency across masked frames. While effective in moderate
cases, these methods struggle under severe content degradation and tend to
overlook spatiotemporal stability, resulting in insufficient control over the
latter parts of the video. To address these limitations, we decouple video
inpainting into two sub-tasks: multi-frame consistent image inpainting and
masked area motion propagation. We propose VidSplice, a novel framework that
introduces spaced-frame priors to guide the inpainting process with
spatiotemporal cues. To enhance spatial coherence, we design a CoSpliced Module
to perform first-frame propagation strategy that diffuses the initial frame
content into subsequent reference frames through a splicing mechanism.
Additionally, we introduce a delicate context controller module that encodes
coherent priors after frame duplication and injects the spliced video into the
I2V generative backbone, effectively constraining content distortion during
generation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that VidSplice achieves
competitive performance across diverse video inpainting scenarios. Moreover,
its design significantly improves both foreground alignment and motion
stability, outperforming existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在胸部X光诊断中准确性高但缺乏可解释性，临床医生需要透明可验证的解释来信任自动化诊断并识别潜在失败模式。

Method: 训练基于transcoder的稀疏自编码器，在BiomedCLIP诊断分类器上分解医学图像表示为可解释视觉模式，使用MIMIC-CXR数据集的多模态嵌入训练100个transcoder集合。

Result: 发现了约5,000个单语义模式，涵盖心脏、肺部、胸膜、结构、设备和伪影类别，每个模式在共享特定放射学特征的图像中表现一致激活行为，在五个关键发现上达到竞争性诊断准确性。

Conclusion: 从针对特定诊断目标训练的分类器中提取可解释特征，确保发现的模式与临床决策直接相关，证明医学AI系统可以既准确又可解释，通过透明、临床基础的解释支持更安全的临床部署。

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable accuracy in chest X-ray
diagnosis, yet their widespread clinical adoption remains limited by the
black-box nature of their predictions. Clinicians require transparent,
verifiable explanations to trust automated diagnoses and identify potential
failure modes. We introduce CXR-LanIC (Language-Grounded Interpretable
Classifier for Chest X-rays), a novel framework that addresses this
interpretability challenge through task-aligned pattern discovery. Our approach
trains transcoder-based sparse autoencoders on a BiomedCLIP diagnostic
classifier to decompose medical image representations into interpretable visual
patterns. By training an ensemble of 100 transcoders on multimodal embeddings
from the MIMIC-CXR dataset, we discover approximately 5,000 monosemantic
patterns spanning cardiac, pulmonary, pleural, structural, device, and artifact
categories. Each pattern exhibits consistent activation behavior across images
sharing specific radiological features, enabling transparent attribution where
predictions decompose into 20-50 interpretable patterns with verifiable
activation galleries. CXR-LanIC achieves competitive diagnostic accuracy on
five key findings while providing the foundation for natural language
explanations through planned large multimodal model annotation. Our key
innovation lies in extracting interpretable features from a classifier trained
on specific diagnostic objectives rather than general-purpose embeddings,
ensuring discovered patterns are directly relevant to clinical decision-making,
demonstrating that medical AI systems can be both accurate and interpretable,
supporting safer clinical deployment through transparent, clinically grounded
explanations.

Conclusion: 细胞级聚合和组织-细胞交互在细粒度计算病理学中起着关键作用

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of histopathological images demands integration of
information across spatial and semantic scales, from nuclear morphology and
cellular textures to global tissue organization and disease-specific patterns.
Although recent foundation models in pathology have shown strong capabilities
in capturing global tissue context, their omission of cell-level feature
modeling remains a key limitation for fine-grained tasks such as cancer subtype
classification. To address this, we propose a dual-stream architecture that
models the interplay between macroscale tissue features and aggregated cellular
representations. To efficiently aggregate information from large cell sets, we
propose a receptance-weighted key-value aggregation model, a recurrent
transformer that captures inter-cell dependencies with linear complexity.
Furthermore, we introduce a bidirectional tissue-cell interaction module to
enable mutual attention between localized cellular cues and their surrounding
tissue environment. Experiments on four histopathological subtype
classification benchmarks show that the proposed method outperforms existing
models, demonstrating the critical role of cell-level aggregation and
tissue-cell interaction in fine-grained computational pathology.

Abstract: GRAP-MOT is a new approach for solving the person MOT problem dedicated to
videos of closed areas with overlapping multi-camera views, where person
occlusion frequently occurs. Our novel graph-weighted solution updates a
person's identification label online based on tracks and the person's
characteristic features. To find the best solution, we deeply investigated all
elements of the MOT process, including feature extraction, tracking, and
community search. Furthermore, GRAP-MOT is equipped with a person's position
estimation module, which gives additional key information to the MOT method,
ensuring better results than methods without position data. We tested GRAP-MOT
on recordings acquired in a closed-area model and on publicly available real
datasets that fulfil the requirement of a highly congested space, showing the
superiority of our proposition. Finally, we analyzed existing metrics used to
compare MOT algorithms and concluded that IDF1 is more adequate than MOTA in
such comparisons. We made our code, along with the acquired dataset, publicly

Abstract: Vision encoders are indispensable for allowing impressive performance of
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in vision language tasks such as
visual question answering and reasoning. However, existing vision encoders
focus on global image representations but overlook fine-grained regional
analysis. They are limited in fine grained perception due to the scarcity of
fine grained annotated data and the lack of a fine grained pre-training
paradigm. In this paper, we propose GranViT, a novel Vision Transformer that
integrates fine-grained feature extraction with semantic alignment to Large
Language Models (LLMs) via region level autoregressive training. We first
construct Gran-29M, a dataset comprising 2million natural and OCR images paired
with over 180 million high-quality region-level annotations, to enable large
scale fine grained pretraining. Consequently, we develop a
pretraining-adaptation framework along with a self distillation mechanism to
train fine-grained GranViT on Gran-29M. We sufficiently exploit the
fine-grained annotations from Gran-29M to resort to bounding-box-to-caption
regression to enhance localized visual representation of the vision encoder in
the pretraining and caption-to-bounding-box regression to improve vision
feature utilization and localization for LLM in the adaptation. We further
incorporate a self distillation mechanism that imposes explicit localization
constraints on the vision encoder to strengthen its regional reasoning
capability. Extensive experiments show that GranViT surpasses existing vision
encoders and attains strong transferability to varying LLMs. Remarkably, it
achieves state-of-the-art results on fine-grained recognition, multimodal VQA,
and OCR understanding.

Building on an established interpretability method, we reinterpret the practice
of probing intermediate activations with the final decoding layer through the
lens of signal processing. This lets us analyze multiple samples in a
principled way and rank attention heads based on their relevance to target
concepts. Our results show consistent patterns of specialization at the head
level across both unimodal and multimodal transformers. Remarkably, we find
that editing as few as 1% of the heads, selected using our method, can reliably
suppress or enhance targeted concepts in the model output. We validate our
approach on language tasks such as question answering and toxicity mitigation,
as well as vision-language tasks including image classification and captioning.
Our findings highlight an interpretable and controllable structure within
attention layers, offering simple tools for understanding and editing
large-scale generative models.

### [53] [Towards a Golden Classifier-Free Guidance Path via Foresight Fixed Point Iterations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21512)
*Kaibo Wang,Jianda Mao,Tong Wu,Yang Xiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了前瞻性引导（FSG）方法，通过统一视角将条件引导重新定义为固定点迭代，解决了现有CFG方法效率低下的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的分类器自由引导（CFG）方法基于不同的理论解释，限制了设计空间并模糊了关键设计选择，需要统一的理论框架来改进。

Method: 将条件引导重新定义为固定点迭代，提出FSG方法在早期扩散阶段优先解决长间隔子问题并增加迭代次数。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型架构上的实验验证了FSG在图像质量和计算效率方面优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为条件引导提供了新的视角，并释放了自适应设计的潜力。

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is an essential component of text-to-image
diffusion models, and understanding and advancing its operational mechanisms
remains a central focus of research. Existing approaches stem from divergent
theoretical interpretations, thereby limiting the design space and obscuring
key design choices. To address this, we propose a unified perspective that
reframes conditional guidance as fixed point iterations, seeking to identify a
golden path where latents produce consistent outputs under both conditional and
unconditional generation. We demonstrate that CFG and its variants constitute a
special case of single-step short-interval iteration, which is theoretically
proven to exhibit inefficiency. To this end, we introduce Foresight Guidance
(FSG), which prioritizes solving longer-interval subproblems in early diffusion
stages with increased iterations. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets
and model architectures validate the superiority of FSG over state-of-the-art
methods in both image quality and computational efficiency. Our work offers
novel perspectives for conditional guidance and unlocks the potential of
adaptive design.

*Ciara Rowles,Varun Jampani,Simon Donné,Shimon Vainer,Julian Parker,Zach Evans*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Foley Control是一种轻量级视频引导Foley方法，通过冻结预训练单模态模型，仅学习它们之间的小型交叉注意力桥接来实现视频到音频的生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要端到端重新训练多模态系统，参数量大且不灵活。Foley Control旨在保持预训练模型优势的同时，实现高效的多模态对齐。

Method: 连接V-JEPA2视频嵌入与冻结的Stable Audio Open DiT文本到音频模型，在现有文本交叉注意力后插入紧凑的视频交叉注意力层，视频token先进行池化以减少内存需求。

Result: 在精选的视频-音频基准测试中，Foley Control在时间和语义对齐方面表现具有竞争力，参数量远少于近期多模态系统，同时保持提示驱动的可控性和模块化。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种参数高效的多模态桥接方案，不仅适用于视频到Foley音效生成，还可扩展到其他音频模态如语音。

Abstract: Foley Control is a lightweight approach to video-guided Foley that keeps
pretrained single-modality models frozen and learns only a small
cross-attention bridge between them. We connect V-JEPA2 video embeddings to a
frozen Stable Audio Open DiT text-to-audio (T2A) model by inserting compact
video cross-attention after the model's existing text cross-attention, so
prompts set global semantics while video refines timing and local dynamics. The
frozen backbones retain strong marginals (video; audio given text) and the
bridge learns the audio-video dependency needed for synchronization -- without
retraining the audio prior. To cut memory and stabilize training, we pool video
tokens before conditioning. On curated video-audio benchmarks, Foley Control
delivers competitive temporal and semantic alignment with far fewer trainable
parameters than recent multi-modal systems, while preserving prompt-driven
controllability and production-friendly modularity (swap/upgrade encoders or
the T2A backbone without end-to-end retraining). Although we focus on
Video-to-Foley, the same bridge design can potentially extend to other audio
modalities (e.g., speech).

### [55] [Sample By Step, Optimize By Chunk: Chunk-Level GRPO For Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21583)
*Yifu Luo,Penghui Du,Bo Li,Sinan Du,Tiantian Zhang,Yongzhe Chang,Kai Wu,Kun Gai,Xueqian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Chunk-GRPO方法，通过将优化从步级提升到块级，解决GRPO在文本到图像生成中的优势归因不准确和忽略生成时序动态的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在基于流匹配的文本到图像生成中表现出潜力，但面临两个关键限制：优势归因不准确，以及忽略生成的时序动态。

Method: 将连续步骤分组为捕捉流匹配内在时序动态的'块'，在块级别优化策略，并引入可选的加权采样策略来进一步提升性能。

Result: 广泛实验表明Chunk-GRPO在偏好对齐和图像质量方面均取得优越结果。

Conclusion: 块级优化为基于GRPO的方法展现了良好前景。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown strong potential for
flow-matching-based text-to-image (T2I) generation, but it faces two key
limitations: inaccurate advantage attribution, and the neglect of temporal
dynamics of generation. In this work, we argue that shifting the optimization
paradigm from the step level to the chunk level can effectively alleviate these
issues. Building on this idea, we propose Chunk-GRPO, the first chunk-level
GRPO-based approach for T2I generation. The insight is to group consecutive
steps into coherent 'chunk's that capture the intrinsic temporal dynamics of
flow matching, and to optimize policies at the chunk level. In addition, we
introduce an optional weighted sampling strategy to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that ChunkGRPO achieves superior
results in both preference alignment and image quality, highlighting the
promise of chunk-level optimization for GRPO-based methods.

*Xuzhao Li,Xuchen Li,Shiyu Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MATrack是一个专门为夜间无人机跟踪设计的系统，通过多尺度层次混合、自适应关键令牌门和夜间模板校准器三个核心模块，解决了低光照条件下的跟踪挑战，在UAVDark135基准测试中性能显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夜间无人机跟踪面临低光照条件、杂乱背景和频繁视角变化的挑战，现有方法存在视觉伪影、计算成本高和难以充分利用动态对象信息等问题。

Method: 提出MATrack系统，包含三个核心模块：多尺度层次混合(MHB)增强静态和动态模板间的特征一致性，自适应关键令牌门准确识别复杂背景中的对象信息，夜间模板校准器(NTC)确保长序列中的稳定跟踪性能。

Result: 在UAVDark135基准测试中，精确度、归一化精确度和AUC分别比最先进方法提升5.9%、5.4%和4.2%，同时保持81 FPS的实时处理速度。在实际无人机平台测试中验证了系统的可靠性。

Conclusion: MATrack能够为夜间搜救和边境巡逻等关键机器人应用提供稳定有效的夜间无人机跟踪支持，在性能和实时性方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Nighttime UAV tracking faces significant challenges in real-world robotics
operations. Low-light conditions not only limit visual perception capabilities,
but cluttered backgrounds and frequent viewpoint changes also cause existing
trackers to drift or fail during deployment. To address these difficulties,
researchers have proposed solutions based on low-light enhancement and domain
adaptation. However, these methods still have notable shortcomings in actual
UAV systems: low-light enhancement often introduces visual artifacts, domain
adaptation methods are computationally expensive and existing lightweight
designs struggle to fully leverage dynamic object information. Based on an
in-depth analysis of these key issues, we propose MATrack-a multiscale adaptive
system designed specifically for nighttime UAV tracking. MATrack tackles the
main technical challenges of nighttime tracking through the collaborative work
of three core modules: Multiscale Hierarchy Blende (MHB) enhances feature
consistency between static and dynamic templates. Adaptive Key Token Gate
accurately identifies object information within complex backgrounds. Nighttime
Template Calibrator (NTC) ensures stable tracking performance over long
sequences. Extensive experiments show that MATrack achieves a significant
performance improvement. On the UAVDark135 benchmark, its precision, normalized
precision and AUC surpass state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 5.9%, 5.4% and
4.2% respectively, while maintaining a real-time processing speed of 81 FPS.
Further tests on a real-world UAV platform validate the system's reliability,
demonstrating that MATrack can provide stable and effective nighttime UAV
tracking support for critical robotics applications such as nighttime search
and rescue and border patrol.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TIGER是一个两阶段文本图像引导超分辨率框架，通过"文本优先、图像随后"的范式，先重建精确的文本结构，再用其指导后续全图像超分辨率，解决了传统方法在图像质量和文本可读性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成式超分辨率方法在自然图像上表现良好，但会扭曲文本，造成图像质量和文本可读性之间的基本权衡。

Method: TIGER采用两阶段框架：第一阶段显式解耦字形恢复，重建精确的文本结构；第二阶段使用重建的文本结构来指导后续全图像超分辨率，实现字形到图像的引导。

Result: 在包含极端缩放（×14.29）的首个场景文本数据集UltraZoom-ST上进行广泛实验，TIGER实现了最先进的性能，在保持整体图像质量的同时增强了可读性。

Conclusion: TIGER通过文本优先的图像引导超分辨率方法，成功打破了图像质量和文本可读性之间的权衡，实现了高保真度和视觉一致性。

Abstract: Current generative super-resolution methods show strong performance on
natural images but distort text, creating a fundamental trade-off between image
quality and textual readability. To address this, we introduce \textbf{TIGER}
(\textbf{T}ext-\textbf{I}mage \textbf{G}uided
sup\textbf{E}r-\textbf{R}esolution), a novel two-stage framework that breaks
this trade-off through a \textit{"text-first, image-later"} paradigm.
\textbf{TIGER} explicitly decouples glyph restoration from image enhancement:
it first reconstructs precise text structures and then uses them to guide
subsequent full-image super-resolution. This glyph-to-image guidance ensures
both high fidelity and visual consistency. To support comprehensive training
and evaluation, we also contribute the \textbf{UltraZoom-ST} (UltraZoom-Scene
Text), the first scene text dataset with extreme zoom (\textbf{$\times$14.29}).
Extensive experiments show that \textbf{TIGER} achieves
\textbf{state-of-the-art} performance, enhancing readability while preserving
overall image quality.

*Pauline Mouches,Julien Jung,Armand Demasson,Agnès Guinard,Romain Bouet,Rosalie Marchal,Romain Quentin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了两种深度学习模型（ANN和CNN）用于自动检测MEG记录中的发作间期癫痫尖波，在仅有时间和单专家标注的临床现实条件下表现优于现有方法，并采用交互式机器学习策略提高标注质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在耐药性癫痫的术前评估中，手动检测MEG记录中的发作间期癫痫尖波是一项繁琐且易出错的任务，现有自动化方法要么需要大量标注数据，要么在非典型数据上缺乏鲁棒性，不适合临床应用。

Method: 提出了两种模型架构：基于特征的人工神经网络（ANN）和卷积神经网络（CNN），在59名患者数据库上训练，并采用交互式机器学习策略迭代改进数据标注质量。

Result: 两种模型在10名测试患者上的表现均优于现有最先进模型（F1分数：CNN=0.46，ANN=0.44），交互式机器学习策略证明模型对噪声标注具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 简单架构的模型在分析复杂且标注不完美的数据时具有鲁棒性，交互式机器学习方法为快速数据标注提供了巨大潜力，所提出的模型是自动检测发作间期癫痫尖波的有用且高效工具。

Abstract: In drug-resistant epilepsy, presurgical evaluation of epilepsy can be
considered. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has been shown to be an effective exam
to inform the localization of the epileptogenic zone through the localization
of interictal epileptic spikes. Manual detection of these pathological
biomarkers remains a fastidious and error-prone task due to the high
dimensionality of MEG recordings, and interrater agreement has been reported to
be only moderate. Current automated methods are unsuitable for clinical
practice, either requiring extensively annotated data or lacking robustness on
non-typical data. In this work, we demonstrate that deep learning models can be
used for detecting interictal spikes in MEG recordings, even when only temporal
and single-expert annotations are available, which represents real-world
clinical practice. We propose two model architectures: a feature-based
artificial neural network (ANN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN),
trained on a database of 59 patients, and evaluated against a state-of-the-art
model to classify short time windows of signal. In addition, we employ an
interactive machine learning strategy to iteratively improve our data
annotation quality using intermediary model outputs. Both proposed models
outperform the state-of-the-art model (F1-scores: CNN=0.46, ANN=0.44) when
tested on 10 holdout test patients. The interactive machine learning strategy
demonstrates that our models are robust to noisy annotations. Overall, results
highlight the robustness of models with simple architectures when analyzing
complex and imperfectly annotated data. Our method of interactive machine
learning offers great potential for faster data annotation, while our models
represent useful and efficient tools for automated interictal spikes detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显著目标检测面临数据受限问题，像素级标注成本高昂，导致相关子任务需要单独训练模型。

Method: 使用多模态扩散管道创建包含139,000+高分辨率图像的S3OD数据集，通过迭代生成框架优先处理困难类别，并提出简化的多掩码解码器处理检测中的固有模糊性。

Result: 仅使用合成数据训练的模型在跨数据集泛化上实现20-50%的错误减少，微调版本在DIS和HR-SOD基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 大规模合成数据和模糊感知架构能有效解决显著目标检测中的数据受限问题，显著提升模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Salient object detection exemplifies data-bounded tasks where expensive
pixel-precise annotations force separate model training for related subtasks
like DIS and HR-SOD. We present a method that dramatically improves
generalization through large-scale synthetic data generation and
ambiguity-aware architecture. We introduce S3OD, a dataset of over 139,000
high-resolution images created through our multi-modal diffusion pipeline that
extracts labels from diffusion and DINO-v3 features. The iterative generation
framework prioritizes challenging categories based on model performance. We
propose a streamlined multi-mask decoder that naturally handles the inherent
ambiguity in salient object detection by predicting multiple valid
interpretations. Models trained solely on synthetic data achieve 20-50% error
reduction in cross-dataset generalization, while fine-tuned versions reach
state-of-the-art performance across DIS and HR-SOD benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Modest-Align轻量级跨模态对齐框架，通过随机扰动和嵌入平滑策略解决资源受限场景下的过自信问题，在少量数据和计算资源下实现竞争性性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在资源受限场景中，现有跨模态对齐模型（如CLIP）因数据质量差或相关性弱而导致的过自信和性能下降问题

Method: 使用随机扰动引入可控噪声模拟不确定性，结合嵌入平滑校准嵌入空间中的相似度分布，共同降低过自信并提升噪声或弱对齐样本的性能

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的检索任务中超越现有最优方法，仅用CLIP 1/100的训练数据和1/600的GPU时间就达到竞争性结果

Conclusion: 为现实世界低资源场景下的跨模态对齐提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Cross-modal alignment aims to map heterogeneous modalities into a shared
latent space, as exemplified by models like CLIP, which benefit from
large-scale image-text pretraining for strong recognition capabilities.
However, when operating in resource-constrained settings with limited or
low-quality data, these models often suffer from overconfidence and degraded
performance due to the prevalence of ambiguous or weakly correlated image-text
pairs. Current contrastive learning approaches, which rely on single positive
pairs, further exacerbate this issue by reinforcing overconfidence on uncertain
samples. To address these challenges, we propose Modest-Align, a lightweight
alignment framework designed for robustness and efficiency. Our approach
leverages two complementary strategies -- Random Perturbation, which introduces
controlled noise to simulate uncertainty, and Embedding Smoothing, which
calibrates similarity distributions in the embedding space. These mechanisms
collectively reduce overconfidence and improve performance on noisy or weakly
aligned samples. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that Modest-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in retrieval
tasks, achieving competitive results with over 100x less training data and 600x
less GPU time than CLIP. Our method offers a practical and scalable solution
for cross-modal alignment in real-world, low-resource scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出通过极线几何约束改进视频扩散模型，解决几何不一致、运动不稳定和视觉伪影问题，使用基于偏好的优化方法直接处理不稳定的相机轨迹和几何伪影。


<details>

Motivation: 当前视频生成模型虽然通过大潜在扩散变换器和整流流技术取得进展，但仍存在几何不一致、运动不稳定和视觉伪影等问题，破坏了真实3D场景的幻觉。3D一致视频生成对生成和重建任务的下游应用有重要影响。

Method: 使用成对极线几何约束通过基于偏好的优化对齐扩散模型，直接解决不稳定的相机轨迹和几何伪影。该方法有效实施几何原理，无需端到端可微性。在静态场景和动态相机上训练确保高质量测量，同时模型能有效泛化到多样化动态内容。

Result: 评估表明，经典几何约束比现代学习指标提供更稳定的优化信号，后者产生噪声目标会损害对齐质量。通过桥接数据驱动的深度学习与经典几何计算机视觉，实现了生成空间一致视频的实用方法。

Conclusion: 通过将数据驱动的深度学习与经典几何计算机视觉相结合，提出了一种在不损害视觉质量的情况下生成空间一致视频的实用方法。

Abstract: Video generation models have progressed tremendously through large latent
diffusion transformers trained with rectified flow techniques. Yet these models
still struggle with geometric inconsistencies, unstable motion, and visual
artifacts that break the illusion of realistic 3D scenes. 3D-consistent video
generation could significantly impact numerous downstream applications in
generation and reconstruction tasks. We explore how epipolar geometry
constraints improve modern video diffusion models. Despite massive training
data, these models fail to capture fundamental geometric principles underlying
visual content. We align diffusion models using pairwise epipolar geometry
constraints via preference-based optimization, directly addressing unstable
camera trajectories and geometric artifacts through mathematically principled
geometric enforcement. Our approach efficiently enforces geometric principles
without requiring end-to-end differentiability. Evaluation demonstrates that
classical geometric constraints provide more stable optimization signals than
modern learned metrics, which produce noisy targets that compromise alignment
quality. Training on static scenes with dynamic cameras ensures high-quality
measurements while the model generalizes effectively to diverse dynamic
content. By bridging data-driven deep learning with classical geometric
computer vision, we present a practical method for generating spatially
consistent videos without compromising visual quality.

TL;DR: 提出DAP-MAE方法，通过自适应整合跨域点云数据集知识来解决点云数据稀缺问题，在预训练和微调阶段分别采用适配和融合模式，实现单一预训练即可在多种下游任务中取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点云数据在不同领域的训练数据规模有限，现有方法尝试混合不同领域数据进行MAE预训练，但学到的先验知识与下游任务可能不匹配，导致性能下降。

Method: 设计异构域适配器，在预训练阶段使用适配模式全面学习跨域点云信息，在微调阶段使用融合模式增强点云特征；同时引入域特征生成器指导点云特征适应不同下游任务。

Result: 仅需一次预训练，就在四个不同点云分析任务中取得优异性能：ScanObjectNN物体分类达到95.18%，Bosphorus面部表情识别达到88.45%。

Conclusion: DAP-MAE能有效解决跨域点云数据预训练中的知识对齐问题，通过自适应整合机制显著提升下游任务性能。

Abstract: Compared to 2D data, the scale of point cloud data in different domains
available for training, is quite limited. Researchers have been trying to
combine these data of different domains for masked autoencoder (MAE)
pre-training to leverage such a data scarcity issue. However, the prior
knowledge learned from mixed domains may not align well with the downstream 3D
point cloud analysis tasks, leading to degraded performance. To address such an
issue, we propose the Domain-Adaptive Point Cloud Masked Autoencoder (DAP-MAE),
an MAE pre-training method, to adaptively integrate the knowledge of
cross-domain datasets for general point cloud analysis. In DAP-MAE, we design a
heterogeneous domain adapter that utilizes an adaptation mode during
pre-training, enabling the model to comprehensively learn information from
point clouds across different domains, while employing a fusion mode in the
fine-tuning to enhance point cloud features. Meanwhile, DAP-MAE incorporates a
domain feature generator to guide the adaptation of point cloud features to
various downstream tasks. With only one pre-training, DAP-MAE achieves
excellent performance across four different point cloud analysis tasks,
reaching 95.18% in object classification on ScanObjectNN and 88.45% in facial
expression recognition on Bosphorus.

Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏方法往往无法捕捉学生模型不断发展的认知能力，导致知识转移效果不佳。

Method: 提出阶段感知蒸馏策略，基于Gompertz曲线动态调整蒸馏损失权重；使用Wasserstein距离测量特征级差异；通过梯度匹配对齐师生模型的反向传播行为；在多重损失目标下统一这些组件。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上的广泛实验表明，Gompertz-CNN始终优于传统蒸馏方法，在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上分别实现了高达8%和4%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: Gompertz-CNN框架通过动态调整蒸馏策略，有效提升了知识蒸馏的性能，证明了基于学习进度动态调整的重要性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel dynamic knowledge distillation framework,
Gompertz-CNN, which integrates the Gompertz growth model into the training
process to address the limitations of traditional knowledge distillation.
Conventional methods often fail to capture the evolving cognitive capacity of
student models, leading to suboptimal knowledge transfer. To overcome this, we
propose a stage-aware distillation strategy that dynamically adjusts the weight
of distillation loss based on the Gompertz curve, reflecting the student's
learning progression: slow initial growth, rapid mid-phase improvement, and
late-stage saturation. Our framework incorporates Wasserstein distance to
measure feature-level discrepancies and gradient matching to align backward
propagation behaviors between teacher and student models. These components are
unified under a multi-loss objective, where the Gompertz curve modulates the
influence of distillation losses over time. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10
and CIFAR-100 using various teacher-student architectures (e.g., ResNet50 and
MobileNet_v2) demonstrate that Gompertz-CNN consistently outperforms
traditional distillation methods, achieving up to 8% and 4% accuracy gains on
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively.

Conclusion: 提出的Group Inertial Poser方法通过融合IMU和UWB技术，实现了在野外环境下多人运动捕捉的精确跟踪，为解决纯IMU方法的局限性提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Tracking human full-body motion using sparse wearable inertial measurement
units (IMUs) overcomes the limitations of occlusion and instrumentation of the
environment inherent in vision-based approaches. However, purely IMU-based
tracking compromises translation estimates and accurate relative positioning
between individuals, as inertial cues are inherently self-referential and
provide no direct spatial reference for others. In this paper, we present a
novel approach for robustly estimating body poses and global translation for
multiple individuals by leveraging the distances between sparse wearable
sensors - both on each individual and across multiple individuals. Our method
Group Inertial Poser estimates these absolute distances between pairs of
sensors from ultra-wideband ranging (UWB) and fuses them with inertial
observations as input into structured state-space models to integrate temporal
motion patterns for precise 3D pose estimation. Our novel two-step optimization
further leverages the estimated distances for accurately tracking people's
global trajectories through the world. We also introduce GIP-DB, the first
IMU+UWB dataset for two-person tracking, which comprises 200 minutes of motion
recordings from 14 participants. In our evaluation, Group Inertial Poser
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness across
synthetic and real-world data, showing the promise of IMU+UWB-based multi-human
motion capture in the wild. Code, models, dataset:

TL;DR: 该论文系统研究了长尾识别方法在北美相机陷阱图像数据集上的应用，通过优化损失函数和正则化策略，显著提升了物种识别准确率，从95.51%提升到99.40%，并在跨域测试中展示了更好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自然世界数据收集中的严重长尾类别不平衡问题，特别是北美相机陷阱图像数据集中最大类别覆盖超过50%图像的情况。

Method: 基于PyTorch Wildlife模型，系统研究长尾识别方法，包括各种LTR损失函数和LTR敏感正则化，构建了减少偏见的测试集来评估域偏移。

Result: 最佳配置在NACTI测试集上达到99.40%的Top-1准确率，显著优于95.51%的基线；在跨域测试中达到52.55%的准确率，优于WCE损失的51.20%。

Conclusion: LTR增强调度器选择在野生动物领域带来一致改进，特别是与最先进的LTR损失结合时，但LTR方法仍无法充分解决严重域偏移下尾类别的灾难性崩溃问题。

Abstract: As most ''in the wild'' data collections of the natural world, the North
America Camera Trap Images (NACTI) dataset shows severe long-tailed class
imbalance, noting that the largest 'Head' class alone covers >50% of the 3.7M
images in the corpus. Building on the PyTorch Wildlife model, we present a
systematic study of Long-Tail Recognition methodologies for species recognition
on the NACTI dataset covering experiments on various LTR loss functions plus
LTR-sensitive regularisation. Our best configuration achieves 99.40% Top-1
accuracy on our NACTI test data split, substantially improving over a 95.51%
baseline using standard cross-entropy with Adam. This also improves on
previously reported top performance in MLWIC2 at 96.8% albeit using partly
unpublished (potentially different) partitioning, optimiser, and evaluation
protocols. To evaluate domain shifts (e.g. night-time captures, occlusion,

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种无监督的突触分类途径，避免了传统监督方法的局限性，为突触类型分析提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Separating synapses into different classes based on their appearance in EM
images has many applications in biology. Examples may include assigning a
neurotransmitter to a particular class, or separating synapses whose strength
can be modulated from those whose strength is fixed. Traditionally, this has
been done in a supervised manner, giving the classification algorithm examples
of the different classes. Here we instead separate synapses into classes based
only on the observation that nearby synapses in the same neuron are likely more
similar than synapses chosen randomly from different cells. We apply our
methodology to data from {\it Drosophila}. Our approach has the advantage that
the number of synapse types does not need to be known in advance. It may also
provide a principled way to select ground-truth that spans the range of synapse
structure.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了UNI和Virchow2两个基础模型作为特征提取器对皮肤病理学全玻片图像进行分类的性能，发现Virchow2在大多数分类器中表现更优，逻辑回归达到90%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤病理学中全玻片图像的快速生成需要自动化方法进行高效处理和准确分类，以应对日益增长的数据处理需求。

Method: 使用UNI和Virchow2基础模型提取补丁级嵌入特征，通过均值聚合策略整合为玻片级特征，然后训练多种机器学习分类器（逻辑回归、梯度提升树、随机森林）。

Result: Virchow2提取的特征在大多数玻片级分类器中优于UNI，逻辑回归对Virchow2特征达到90%准确率，但差异无统计学显著性。均值聚合方法提供了可靠的玻片级特征表示。

Conclusion: 基础模型在自动WSI分类中具有潜力，为皮肤病理学诊断提供了可扩展且有效的方法，并为玻片级表示学习的未来发展铺平了道路。

Abstract: The rapid generation of whole-slide images (WSIs) in dermatopathology
necessitates automated methods for efficient processing and accurate
classification. This study evaluates the performance of two foundation models,
UNI and Virchow2, as feature extractors for classifying WSIs into three
diagnostic categories: melanocytic, basaloid, and squamous lesions. Patch-level
embeddings were aggregated into slide-level features using a mean-aggregation
strategy and subsequently used to train multiple machine learning classifiers,
including logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees, and random forest
models. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, true positive rate,
false positive rate, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUROC) on the test set. Results demonstrate that patch-level features
extracted using Virchow2 outperformed those extracted via UNI across most
slide-level classifiers, with logistic regression achieving the highest
accuracy (90%) for Virchow2, though the difference was not statistically
significant. The study also explored data augmentation techniques and image
normalization to enhance model robustness and generalizability. The
mean-aggregation approach provided reliable slide-level feature
representations. All experimental results and metrics were tracked and
visualized using WandB.ai, facilitating reproducibility and interpretability.
This research highlights the potential of foundation models for automated WSI
classification, providing a scalable and effective approach for
dermatopathological diagnosis while paving the way for future advancements in
slide-level representation learning.

Motivation: 现有方法面临关键挑战：2D提升方法存在视图间几何和外观不一致，3D隐式表示难以扩展，当前3D基础模型多为对象中心，限制了场景级生成的应用。

Method: 提出三个核心组件：1) 数据整理流程提取高质量场景块用于训练；2) 3D块修复机制实现上下文感知的场景扩展；3) 从粗到细的生成策略确保全局布局合理性和局部几何/纹理保真度。

Result: 在3D-FRONT数据集上评估，WorldGrow在几何重建方面达到SOTA性能，同时独特支持具有照片级真实感和结构一致输出的无限场景生成。

Conclusion: WorldGrow展示了构建大规模虚拟环境的能力，并具有构建未来世界模型的潜力。

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of generating the infinitely extendable 3D world --
large, continuous environments with coherent geometry and realistic appearance.
Existing methods face key challenges: 2D-lifting approaches suffer from
geometric and appearance inconsistencies across views, 3D implicit
representations are hard to scale up, and current 3D foundation models are
mostly object-centric, limiting their applicability to scene-level generation.
Our key insight is leveraging strong generation priors from pre-trained 3D
models for structured scene block generation. To this end, we propose
WorldGrow, a hierarchical framework for unbounded 3D scene synthesis. Our
method features three core components: (1) a data curation pipeline that
extracts high-quality scene blocks for training, making the 3D structured
latent representations suitable for scene generation; (2) a 3D block inpainting
mechanism that enables context-aware scene extension; and (3) a coarse-to-fine
generation strategy that ensures both global layout plausibility and local
geometric/textural fidelity. Evaluated on the large-scale 3D-FRONT dataset,
WorldGrow achieves SOTA performance in geometry reconstruction, while uniquely
supporting infinite scene generation with photorealistic and structurally
consistent outputs. These results highlight its capability for constructing
large-scale virtual environments and potential for building future world
models.

Conclusion: 通过将目标检测与后验可解释性相结合，可以从黑盒预测转向可审计的决策支持工具，为保护监测提供更可信的解决方案。

Abstract: Computer vision can accelerate ecological research and conservation
monitoring, yet adoption in ecology lags in part because of a lack of trust in
black-box neural-network-based models. We seek to address this challenge by
applying post-hoc explanations to provide evidence for predictions and document
limitations that are important to field deployment. Using aerial imagery from
Glacier Bay National Park, we train a Faster R-CNN to detect pinnipeds (harbor
seals) and generate explanations via gradient-based class activation mapping
(HiResCAM, LayerCAM), local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME),
and perturbation-based explanations. We assess explanations along three axes
relevant to field use: (i) localization fidelity: whether high-attribution
regions coincide with the animal rather than background context; (ii)
faithfulness: whether deletion/insertion tests produce changes in detector
confidence; and (iii) diagnostic utility: whether explanations reveal
systematic failure modes. Explanations concentrate on seal torsos and contours
rather than surrounding ice/rock, and removal of the seals reduces detection
confidence, providing model-evidence for true positives. The analysis also
uncovers recurrent error sources, including confusion between seals and black
ice and rocks. We translate these findings into actionable next steps for model
development, including more targeted data curation and augmentation. By pairing
object detection with post-hoc explainability, we can move beyond "black-box"
predictions toward auditable, decision-supporting tools for conservation
monitoring.

Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖参考图像或大量训练，且往往只解决角色一致性，将背景一致性留给图像到视频模型处理。

Method: 基于对DiT注意力机制和中间特征的系统分析，首先生成一个身份视频并缓存中间变量，然后将这些变量注入到新生成视频的对应位置。

Result: 实验结果表明，BachVid在不需额外训练的情况下实现了生成视频的稳健一致性。

Conclusion: BachVid为无需参考图像或额外训练的一致视频生成提供了新颖高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently driven significant progress in
text-to-video (T2V) generation. However, generating multiple videos with
consistent characters and backgrounds remains a significant challenge. Existing
methods typically rely on reference images or extensive training, and often
only address character consistency, leaving background consistency to
image-to-video models. We introduce BachVid, the first training-free method
that achieves consistent video generation without needing any reference images.
Our approach is based on a systematic analysis of DiT's attention mechanism and
intermediate features, revealing its ability to extract foreground masks and
identify matching points during the denoising process. Our method leverages
this finding by first generating an identity video and caching the intermediate
variables, and then inject these cached variables into corresponding positions
in newly generated videos, ensuring both foreground and background consistency
across multiple videos. Experimental results demonstrate that BachVid achieves
robust consistency in generated videos without requiring additional training,
offering a novel and efficient solution for consistent video generation without
relying on reference images or additional training.

Conclusion: 在图像空间中操作提供了一个通用且实用的框架，用于逼近著名难题，并为解决更广泛的几何任务打开了大门。

Abstract: In this paper we show that visual diffusion models can serve as effective
geometric solvers: they can directly reason about geometric problems by working
in pixel space. We first demonstrate this on the Inscribed Square Problem, a
long-standing problem in geometry that asks whether every Jordan curve contains
four points forming a square. We then extend the approach to two other
well-known hard geometric problems: the Steiner Tree Problem and the Simple
Polygon Problem.
  Our method treats each problem instance as an image and trains a standard
visual diffusion model that transforms Gaussian noise into an image
representing a valid approximate solution that closely matches the exact one.
The model learns to transform noisy geometric structures into correct
configurations, effectively recasting geometric reasoning as image generation.
  Unlike prior work that necessitates specialized architectures and
domain-specific adaptations when applying diffusion to parametric geometric
representations, we employ a standard visual diffusion model that operates on
the visual representation of the problem. This simplicity highlights a
surprising bridge between generative modeling and geometric problem solving.
Beyond the specific problems studied here, our results point toward a broader
paradigm: operating in image space provides a general and practical framework
for approximating notoriously hard problems, and opens the door to tackling a
far wider class of challenging geometric tasks.

Abstract: When a vision model performs image recognition, which visual attributes drive
its predictions? Detecting unintended reliance on specific visual features is
critical for ensuring model robustness, preventing overfitting, and avoiding
spurious correlations. We introduce an automated framework for detecting such
dependencies in trained vision models. At the core of our method is a
self-reflective agent that systematically generates and tests hypotheses about
visual attributes that a model may rely on. This process is iterative: the
agent refines its hypotheses based on experimental outcomes and uses a
self-evaluation protocol to assess whether its findings accurately explain
model behavior. When inconsistencies arise, the agent self-reflects over its
findings and triggers a new cycle of experimentation. We evaluate our approach
on a novel benchmark of 130 models designed to exhibit diverse visual attribute
dependencies across 18 categories. Our results show that the agent's
performance consistently improves with self-reflection, with a significant
performance increase over non-reflective baselines. We further demonstrate that
the agent identifies real-world visual attribute dependencies in
state-of-the-art models, including CLIP's vision encoder and the YOLOv8 object
detector.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在科学和诊断等高风险AI应用中，需要基于语言模型的智能体能够理性地进行数据驱动的假设形成和目标猜测，但现有LM智能体在信息寻求方面存在不足。

Method: 引入协作战舰游戏任务，开发基于贝叶斯实验设计的蒙特卡洛推理策略，分别针对观察者（Spotter）和船长（Captain）角色优化信息提供和行动选择。

Result: 观察者准确率提升14.7%，船长预期信息增益提升0.227比特（达到噪声上限的94.2%），较弱模型Llama-4-Scout胜率从8%提升至82%，成本仅为GPT-5的1%。

Conclusion: 该方法在多个战略决策任务中表现出通用性，为构建理性信息寻求智能体提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Many high-stakes applications of AI require forming data-driven hypotheses
and making targeted guesses; e.g., in scientific and diagnostic settings. Given
limited resources, to what extent do agents based on language models (LMs) act
rationally? We develop methods to benchmark and enhance agentic
information-seeking, drawing on insights from human behavior. First, we
introduce a strategic decision-oriented dialogue task called Collaborative
Battleship, in which a partially-informed Captain must balance exploration
(asking questions) and action (taking shots), while a fully-informed Spotter
must provide accurate answers under an information bottleneck. Compared to
human players (N=42), we find that LM agents struggle to ground answers in
context, generate informative questions, and select high-value actions. Next,
to address these gaps, we develop novel Monte Carlo inference strategies for
LMs based on principles from Bayesian Experimental Design (BED). For Spotter
agents, our approach boosts accuracy by up to 14.7% absolute over LM-only
baselines; for Captain agents, it raises expected information gain (EIG) by up
to 0.227 bits (94.2% of the achievable noise ceiling). Combined, these
components yield sharper targeting (+0.303-0.374 F1), and enable weaker LMs,
such as Llama-4-Scout, to outperform both humans (8% -> 82% win rate) and
frontier models (0% -> 67% win rate vs. GPT-5) at ~1% of GPT-5's cost. We
replicate these findings on Guess Who? where our methods significantly boost
accuracy (+28.3-42.4 p.p.), demonstrating their general applicability for
building rational information-seeking agents.

TL;DR: CodeAdapt方法让标准指令语言模型无需微调就能达到或超越专用推理模型的性能，通过结合代码执行和少样本学习实现高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理模型需要大量计算资源和数据训练，运行成本高且效率低。研究发现标准指令语言模型本身已具备强大的推理能力，只需合适的激发方法。

Method: 提出CodeAdapt方法，结合CodeAct框架（语言模型在推理过程中交替使用自然语言和代码执行）和少样本引导的上下文学习，仅需5个训练问题即可实现高效推理。

Result: 在4对匹配的语言模型和推理模型对比中，CodeAdapt让3个语言模型在8个任务上平均表现优于对应推理模型（最高提升22.9%），同时token效率提升10-81%。在6个任务上，4个模型平均性能表现更优（最高提升35.7%）。

Conclusion: CodeAdapt式学习和推理具有鲁棒性和领域通用性，基于代码的语言模型是认知基础扎实且强大的系统，为权重内强化学习提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Reasoning models (RMs), language models (LMs) trained with reinforcement
learning to produce long-form natural language reasoning, have been remarkably
successful, but they still require large amounts of computation and data to
train, and can be slow and expensive to run. In this paper, we show that
standard instruct LMs can already be elicited to be strong reasoners at a level
comparable to or even surpassing their corresponding RMs (e.g., DeepSeek V3 vs
R1) without finetuning, across diverse domains from instruction following and
creative generation to mathematical reasoning. This is achieved by CodeAdapt,
our simple recipe that combines the CodeAct framework, where LMs interleave
natural language reasoning with code execution in a multi-step fashion, with
few-shot bootstrap in-context learning from as few as five training problems.
Analyzing four matched pairs of LMs and RMs, we find that CodeAdapt enables
three LMs to outperform the corresponding RMs on average over eight tasks (up
to 22.9%) while being 10-81% more token efficient, and delivers superior
performance on six tasks when averaged over the four models (up to 35.7%).
Furthermore, the code-augmented reasoning traces display rich and varied
problem-solving strategies. Our findings support that (1) CodeAdapt-style
learning and reasoning may be robust and domain general and (2) code-enabled
LMs are cognitively grounded and powerful systems, potentially providing a
strong foundation for in-weight reinforcement learning.

Abstract: As language models become capable of processing increasingly long and complex
texts, there has been growing interest in their application within
computational literary studies. However, evaluating the usefulness of these
models for such tasks remains challenging due to the cost of fine-grained
annotation for long-form texts and the data contamination concerns inherent in
using public-domain literature. Current embedding similarity datasets are not
suitable for evaluating literary-domain tasks because of a focus on
coarse-grained similarity and primarily on very short text. We assemble and
release FICSIM, a dataset of long-form, recently written fiction, including
scores along 12 axes of similarity informed by author-produced metadata and
validated by digital humanities scholars. We evaluate a suite of embedding
models on this task, demonstrating a tendency across models to focus on
surface-level features over semantic categories that would be useful for
computational literary studies tasks. Throughout our data-collection process,
we prioritize author agency and rely on continual, informed author consent.

Method: 使用236对案例数据集，评估最先进的大语言模型识别美国最高法院案例中的推翻关系的能力

Result: 评估揭示了三个关键限制：时代敏感性（模型对历史案例表现较差）、浅层推理（依赖浅层逻辑启发式而非深度法律理解）、上下文依赖推理失败（复杂任务中产生时间上不可能的关系）

Conclusion: 这项工作填补了现实长上下文评估的关键空白，提供了一个反映实际法律推理任务复杂性和重要性的基准测试环境

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows show promise for
complex legal reasoning tasks, yet their ability to understand long legal
documents remains insufficiently evaluated. Developing long-context benchmarks
that capture realistic, high-stakes tasks remains a significant challenge in
the field, as most existing evaluations rely on simplified synthetic tasks that
fail to represent the complexity of real-world document understanding.
Overruling relationships are foundational to common-law doctrine and commonly
found in judicial opinions. They provide a focused and important testbed for
long-document legal understanding that closely resembles what legal
professionals actually do. We present an assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs on
identifying overruling relationships from U.S. Supreme Court cases using a
dataset of 236 case pairs. Our evaluation reveals three critical limitations:
(1) era sensitivity -- the models show degraded performance on historical cases
compared to modern ones, revealing fundamental temporal bias in their training;
(2) shallow reasoning -- models rely on shallow logical heuristics rather than
deep legal comprehension; and (3) context-dependent reasoning failures --
models produce temporally impossible relationships in complex open-ended tasks
despite maintaining basic temporal awareness in simple contexts. Our work
contributes a benchmark that addresses the critical gap in realistic
long-context evaluation, providing an environment that mirrors the complexity
and stakes of actual legal reasoning tasks.

Result: 人类在所有语言特征上都优于所有模型，平均准确率高16.6%；开源和闭源LLMs之间存在18.1%的性能差距；最强模型gpt-5准确率仅73.5%，而人类达到90.1%；人类和模型在爱尔兰语语法的不同方面存在困难。

Abstract: We present Irish-BLiMP (Irish Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal Pairs), the
first dataset and framework designed for fine-grained evaluation of linguistic
competence in the Irish language, an endangered language. Drawing on a variety
of linguistic literature and grammar reference works, we manually constructed
and reviewed 1020 minimal pairs across a taxonomy of 11 linguistic features,
through a team of fluent Irish speakers. We evaluate both existing Large
Language Models (LLMs) and fluent human participants on their syntactic
knowledge of Irish. Our findings show that humans outperform all models across
all linguistic features, achieving 16.6% higher accuracy on average. Moreover,
a substantial performance gap of 18.1% persists between open- and closed-source
LLMs, with even the strongest model (gpt-5) reaching only 73.5% accuracy
compared to 90.1% by human. Interestingly, human participants and models
struggle on different aspects of Irish grammar, thus highlighting a difference
in representation learned by the models. Overall, Irish-BLiMP provides the
first systematic framework for evaluating the grammatical competence of LLMs in
Irish and offers a valuable benchmark for advancing research on linguistic
understanding in low-resource languages.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a common technique for
enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). While
extended reasoning can boost accuracy on complex tasks, it is often unnecessary
and substantially increases token usage, limiting the practicality of reasoning
models in many scenarios. Recent models, such as GPT-OSS and Qwen3, expose
controls that enable users to adjust the length of CoT or determine whether it
is used at all. Yet, it remains unclear when CoT should be used: on some tasks
it improves performance, while on others it provides little benefit or even
harms performance. We address this challenge with confidence-gated CoT, where a
model invokes reasoning only when confidence in its direct answer is low. To
this end, we present the first systematic study of training-free confidence
estimation methods for CoT gating. Specifically, we evaluate four training-free
confidence estimation methods and compare them to a random baseline and an
oracle that always knows when CoT is needed. Through extensive experiments, we
show that existing training-free confidence measures can reduce redundant CoT
and outperform randomly invoked CoT. However, the utility of individual
confidence measures is inconsistent, varying with both the dataset and the
model, underscoring the difficulty of deploying confidence-gated CoT in

*Barkavi Sundararajan,Somayajulu Sripada,Ehud Reiter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了输入数据结构对LLM生成NBA比赛摘要中事实错误的影响，发现JSON格式输入相比非结构化输入能减少约65-69%的错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在体育报道等准确性要求高的领域部署LLMs时，生成的文本可能无法忠实反映输入数据，需要量化输入结构对幻觉和其他事实错误的影响。

Method: 使用三种输入格式（行结构化、JSON和非结构化）分析LLM生成的NBA比赛摘要，手动标注了3,312个事实错误，涉及180场比赛摘要和两个模型（Llama-3.1-70B和Qwen2.5-72B）。

Result: 输入结构对错误率有显著影响：JSON输入相比非结构化输入，Llama错误率降低69%，Qwen降低65%；行结构化输入分别降低54%和51%。方差分析显示输入结构解释了80%以上的错误率方差。

Conclusion: 输入结构对LLM生成摘要的事实准确性有决定性影响，结构化输入格式（特别是JSON）能显著减少事实错误。

Abstract: A major concern when deploying LLMs in accuracy-critical domains such as
sports reporting is that the generated text may not faithfully reflect the
input data. We quantify how input structure affects hallucinations and other
factual errors in LLM-generated summaries of NBA play-by-play data, across
three formats: row-structured, JSON and unstructured. We manually annotated
3,312 factual errors across 180 game summaries produced by two models,
Llama-3.1-70B and Qwen2.5-72B. Input structure has a strong effect: JSON input
reduces error rates by 69% for Llama and 65% for Qwen compared to unstructured
input, while row-structured input reduces errors by 54% for Llama and 51% for
Qwen. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA shows that input structure accounts for
over 80% of the variance in error rates, with Tukey HSD post hoc tests
confirming statistically significant differences between all input formats.

*Giovanni Trappolini,Florin Cuconasu,Simone Filice,Yoelle Maarek,Fabrizio Silvestri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出UDCG指标来解决传统IR指标在RAG系统中的不适用问题，通过考虑LLM处理文档的整体性和分散注意力的负面影响，显著提高了与端到端答案准确性的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IR指标基于人类用户按顺序浏览文档的假设，但在RAG系统中，LLM会整体处理所有检索文档，且分散注意力的无关文档会降低生成质量，导致传统指标无法准确预测RAG性能。

Method: 引入基于效用的标注方案，量化相关段落的正面贡献和分散注意力的负面影响，提出UDCG指标，使用面向LLM的位置折扣来直接优化与端到端答案准确性的相关性。

Result: 在五个数据集和六个LLM上的实验表明，UDCG相比传统指标将相关性提高了高达36%。

Conclusion: UDCG为将IR评估与LLM消费者对齐提供了关键步骤，能够更可靠地评估RAG组件。

Abstract: Traditional Information Retrieval (IR) metrics, such as nDCG, MAP, and MRR,
assume that human users sequentially examine documents with diminishing
attention to lower ranks. This assumption breaks down in Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) systems, where search results are consumed by Large Language
Models (LLMs), which, unlike humans, process all retrieved documents as a whole
rather than sequentially. Additionally, traditional IR metrics do not account
for related but irrelevant documents that actively degrade generation quality,
rather than merely being ignored. Due to these two major misalignments, namely
human vs. machine position discount and human relevance vs. machine utility,
classical IR metrics do not accurately predict RAG performance. We introduce a
utility-based annotation schema that quantifies both the positive contribution
of relevant passages and the negative impact of distracting ones. Building on
this foundation, we propose UDCG (Utility and Distraction-aware Cumulative
Gain), a metric using an LLM-oriented positional discount to directly optimize
the correlation with the end-to-end answer accuracy. Experiments on five
datasets and six LLMs demonstrate that UDCG improves correlation by up to 36%
compared to traditional metrics. Our work provides a critical step toward
aligning IR evaluation with LLM consumers and enables more reliable assessment
of RAG components

TL;DR: 推理在低假阳性率(FPR)场景下存在权衡：推理增强(Think On)提升整体准确率但在严格精度要求下表现不佳，无推理(Think Off)在精度敏感任务中占优，两者集成可互补优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究推理在精度敏感分类任务中的适用性，特别是在低假阳性率(FPR)场景下的表现，填补系统研究的空白。

Method: 在安全检测和幻觉检测任务上，对比微调和零样本设置，评估标准LLM和大推理模型(LRM)，分析推理增强(Think On)与无推理(Think On)两种模式。

Result: 推理增强模式提升整体准确率但在低FPR阈值下表现不佳；无推理模式在精度敏感场景中占优；基于token的评分优于自述置信度；两种模式集成可发挥各自优势。

Conclusion: 推理是双刃剑：有益于平均准确率，但不适合需要严格精度的应用场景。

Abstract: Reasoning has become a central paradigm for large language models (LLMs),
consistently boosting accuracy across diverse benchmarks. Yet its suitability
for precision-sensitive tasks remains unclear. We present the first systematic
study of reasoning for classification tasks under strict low false positive
rate (FPR) regimes. Our analysis covers two tasks--safety detection and
hallucination detection--evaluated in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings,
using standard LLMs and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). Our results reveal a
clear trade-off: Think On (reasoning-augmented) generation improves overall
accuracy, but underperforms at the low-FPR thresholds essential for practical
use. In contrast, Think Off (no reasoning during inference) dominates in these
precision-sensitive regimes, with Think On surpassing only when higher FPRs are
acceptable. In addition, we find token-based scoring substantially outperforms
self-verbalized confidence for precision-sensitive deployments. Finally, a
simple ensemble of the two modes recovers the strengths of each. Taken
together, our findings position reasoning as a double-edged tool: beneficial
for average accuracy, but often ill-suited for applications requiring strict
precision.

TL;DR: DR-IKE是一个轻量级框架，通过动态检索和剪枝演示示例来实现上下文知识编辑，无需修改模型权重，兼容黑盒LLM，在编辑成功率和延迟方面均有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前上下文知识编辑方法存在的两个问题：(i)数量-质量权衡问题，以及(ii)缺乏对任务难度的适应性。现有方法依赖静态演示集，选择标准仅基于表面相似性。

Method: 提出DR-IKE框架：(1)使用REINFORCE训练BERT检索器，根据编辑奖励对演示进行排序；(2)采用可学习阈值剪枝低价值示例，根据任务难度动态调整提示长度。

Result: 在COUNTERFACT基准测试中，编辑成功率提升高达17.1%，延迟减少41.6%，同时保持对不相关查询的准确性。

Conclusion: DR-IKE展示了可扩展和自适应的知识编辑能力，为黑盒LLM的知识更新提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at factual recall yet still propagate
stale or incorrect knowledge. In-context knowledge editing offers a
gradient-free remedy suitable for black-box APIs, but current editors rely on
static demonstration sets chosen by surface-level similarity, leading to two
persistent obstacles: (i) a quantity-quality trade-off, and (ii) lack of
adaptivity to task difficulty. We address these issues by dynamically selecting
supporting demonstrations according to their utility for the edit. We propose
Dynamic Retriever for In-Context Knowledge Editing (DR-IKE), a lightweight
framework that (1) trains a BERT retriever with REINFORCE to rank
demonstrations by editing reward, and (2) employs a learnable threshold to
prune low-value examples, shortening the prompt when the edit is easy and
expanding it when the task is hard. DR-IKE performs editing without modifying
model weights, relying solely on forward passes for compatibility with
black-box LLMs. On the COUNTERFACT benchmark, it improves edit success by up to
17.1%, reduces latency by 41.6%, and preserves accuracy on unrelated queries,
demonstrating scalable and adaptive knowledge editing. The code is available at

Motivation: 解决当前问答系统主要针对英语，而印尼语等低资源语言缺乏先进问答技术的问题。

Method: 采用自适应RAG系统，集成问题复杂度分类器，使用机器翻译进行数据增强，并测试多检索回答策略。

Result: 问题复杂度分类器表现可靠，但多检索回答策略存在显著不一致性，对整体评估产生负面影响。

Conclusion: 研究展示了低资源语言问答的潜力和挑战，为未来改进指明了方向。

Abstract: Question Answering (QA) has seen significant improvements with the
advancement of machine learning models, further studies enhanced this question
answering system by retrieving external information, called Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) to produce more accurate and informative answers. However,
these state-of-the-art-performance is predominantly in English language. To
address this gap we made an effort of bridging language gaps by incorporating
Adaptive RAG system to Indonesian language. Adaptive RAG system integrates a
classifier whose task is to distinguish the question complexity, which in turn
determines the strategy for answering the question. To overcome the limited
availability of Indonesian language dataset, our study employs machine
translation as data augmentation approach. Experiments show reliable question
complexity classifier; however, we observed significant inconsistencies in
multi-retrieval answering strategy which negatively impacted the overall
evaluation when this strategy was applied. These findings highlight both the
promise and challenges of question answering in low-resource language
suggesting directions for future improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决电子健康记录(EHR)药物推荐系统发展中缺乏公开、真实世界数据集的问题，特别是非英语语言的数据稀缺。

Method: 构建包含5,894条去标识化记录的CDrugRed数据集，涵盖患者人口统计、病史、临床过程和出院诊断等信息，并基于该数据集对多个大语言模型进行基准测试。

Result: 监督微调能提升模型性能，但仍有很大改进空间，最佳模型的F1分数为0.5648，Jaccard分数为0.4477。

Conclusion: 临床药物推荐任务具有复杂性，CDrugRed数据集为开发更鲁棒和准确的药物推荐系统提供了具有挑战性和价值的资源。

Abstract: Intelligent drug recommendation based on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is
critical for improving for improving the quality and efficiency of clinical
decision-making. By leveraging large-scale patient data, drug recommendation
systems can assist physicians in selecting the most appropriate medications
according to a patient's medical history, diagnoses, laboratory results, and
comorbidities. However, the advancement of such systems is significantly
hampered by the scarcity of publicly available, real-world EHR datasets,
particularly in languages other than English. In this work, we present
CDrugRed, a first publicly available Chinese drug recommendation dataset
focused on discharge medications for metabolic diseases. The dataset includes
5,894 de-identified records from 3,190 patients, containing comprehensive
information such as patient demographics, medical history, clinical course, and
discharge diagnoses. We assess the utility of CDrugRed by benchmarking several
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on the discharge medication
recommendation task. Experimental results show that while supervised
fine-tuning improves model performance, there remains substantial room for
improvement, with the best model achieving the F1 score of 0.5648 and Jaccard
score of 0.4477. This result highlights the complexity of the clinical drug
recommendation task and establishes CDrugRed as a challenging and valuable
resource for developing more robust and accurate drug recommendation systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Self-Rewarding PPO方法，结合SFT和PPO的优势，通过设计基于SFT模型与预训练基础模型对数策略比率的奖励函数，实现无需人工偏好标注的在线策略微调，解决SFT的过拟合和泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调(SFT)作为对齐大语言模型的重要方法，存在过拟合和域外泛化能力差的问题，特别是在数据有限的情况下。需要一种能够提高泛化性能的在线策略微调方法。

Method: 结合SFT和近端策略优化(PPO)，设计奖励函数作为SFT模型与预训练基础模型的对数策略比率，将预训练策略作为基线，SFT策略作为目标，实现自我奖励机制。

Result: 在多种自然语言处理任务上的实证评估表明，Self-Rewarding PPO始终优于传统SFT方法，特别是在高质量标注数据稀缺的情况下。

Conclusion: Self-Rewarding PPO方法有效解决了SFT的局限性，提高了泛化能力、数据效率和鲁棒性，为使用演示数据对齐LLMs提供了更有效的途径。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has emerged as a crucial method for aligning
large language models (LLMs) with human-annotated demonstrations. However, SFT,
being an off-policy approach similar to behavior cloning, often struggles with
overfitting and poor out-of-domain generalization, especially in limited-data
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Rewarding PPO, a novel
fine-tuning method that leverages on-policy techniques to enhance
generalization performance. Our approach combines the strengths of SFT and
proximal policy optimization (PPO) to achieve more effective alignment from
demonstration data. At its core is a reward function designed as the log policy
ratio between the SFT model and the pretrained base model. This function serves
as an implicit reward signal, using the pretrained policy as a baseline and the
SFT policy as a target. By doing so, it enables on-policy fine-tuning without
relying on human preference annotations. The integration of this self-rewarding
mechanism with PPO addresses key limitations of SFT, improving generalization,
data efficiency, and robustness. Our empirical evaluation across a range of
natural language processing tasks demonstrates that Self-Rewarding PPO
consistently outperforms traditional SFT methods. The results highlight the
effectiveness of our approach in aligning LLMs using demonstration data,
particularly in scenarios where high-quality annotated data is scarce.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有忠实性基准测试存在标注模糊问题，主要由于生成输出中允许使用外部知识的边界不明确，导致标注不一致。

Method: 提出了新的忠实性标注框架，引入中间类别Out-Dependent来分类需要外部知识验证的情况，并构建了VeriGray基准测试。

Result: 统计显示SOTA LLM在摘要任务中仍存在约6%的幻觉，约8%的生成句子属于Out-Dependent类别，基准测试对多种基线方法构成挑战。

Conclusion: 解决标注模糊对于忠实性检测基准测试至关重要，当前方法仍有很大改进空间。

Abstract: Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) generate summaries faithful to a
given source document is essential for real-world applications. While prior
research has explored LLM faithfulness, existing benchmarks suffer from
annotation ambiguity, primarily due to the ill-defined boundary of permissible
external knowledge in generated outputs. For instance, common sense is often
incorporated into responses and labeled as "faithful", yet the acceptable
extent of such knowledge remains unspecified, leading to inconsistent
annotations. To address this issue, we propose a novel faithfulness annotation
framework, which introduces an intermediate category, Out-Dependent, to
classify cases where external knowledge is required for verification. Using
this framework, we construct VeriGray (Verification with the Gray Zone) -- a
new unfaithfulness detection benchmark in summarization. Statistics reveal that
even SOTA LLMs, such as GPT-5, exhibit hallucinations ($\sim 6\%$ of sentences)
in summarization tasks. Moreover, a substantial proportion ($\sim 8\%$ on
average of models) of generated sentences fall into the Out-Dependent category,
underscoring the importance of resolving annotation ambiguity in unfaithfulness
detection benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that our benchmark poses
significant challenges to multiple baseline methods, indicating considerable
room for future improvement.

Conclusion: 为语言和图学习的交叉研究提供了系统指导，指出了开放挑战和未来研究方向，旨在推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural
language processing through strong semantic understanding and generation.
However, their black-box nature limits structured and multi-hop reasoning. In
contrast, Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) provide explicit relational structures
enriched with textual context, yet often lack semantic depth. Recent research
shows that combining LLMs and TAGs yields complementary benefits: enhancing TAG
representation learning and improving the reasoning and interpretability of
LLMs. This survey provides the first systematic review of LLM--TAG integration
from an orchestration perspective. We introduce a novel taxonomy covering two
fundamental directions: LLM for TAG, where LLMs enrich graph-based tasks, and
TAG for LLM, where structured graphs improve LLM reasoning. We categorize
orchestration strategies into sequential, parallel, and multi-module
frameworks, and discuss advances in TAG-specific pretraining, prompting, and
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Beyond methodology, we summarize empirical
insights, curate available datasets, and highlight diverse applications across
recommendation systems, biomedical analysis, and knowledge-intensive question
answering. Finally, we outline open challenges and promising research
directions, aiming to guide future work at the intersection of language and
graph learning.

Method: 通过聊天室风格的多智能体交互模拟，在五个语言维度上分析LLMs的社会认知偏见

Result: 发现LLMs表现出社会角色偏见、首因效应和积极性偏见，形成了缺乏真实人类互动复杂性的"乌托邦"社会

Conclusion: 需要开发更具社会基础性的LLMs，以捕捉人类社会行为的多样性

Abstract: Reliable simulation of human behavior is essential for explaining,
predicting, and intervening in our society. Recent advances in large language
models (LLMs) have shown promise in emulating human behaviors, interactions,
and decision-making, offering a powerful new lens for social science studies.
However, the extent to which LLMs diverge from authentic human behavior in
social contexts remains underexplored, posing risks of misinterpretation in
scientific studies and unintended consequences in real-world applications.
Here, we introduce a systematic framework for analyzing LLMs' behavior in
social simulation. Our approach simulates multi-agent interactions through
chatroom-style conversations and analyzes them across five linguistic
dimensions, providing a simple yet effective method to examine emergent social
cognitive biases. We conduct extensive experiments involving eight
representative LLMs across three families. Our findings reveal that LLMs do not
faithfully reproduce genuine human behavior but instead reflect overly
idealized versions of it, shaped by the social desirability bias. In
particular, LLMs show social role bias, primacy effect, and positivity bias,
resulting in "Utopian" societies that lack the complexity and variability of
real human interactions. These findings call for more socially grounded LLMs
that capture the diversity of human social behavior.

Abstract: The availability of LLM benchmarks for the Estonian language is limited, and
a comprehensive evaluation comparing the performance of different LLMs on
Estonian tasks has yet to be conducted. We introduce a new benchmark for
evaluating LLMs in Estonian, based on seven diverse datasets. These datasets
assess general and domain-specific knowledge, understanding of Estonian grammar
and vocabulary, summarization abilities, contextual comprehension, and more.
The datasets are all generated from native Estonian sources without using
machine translation. We compare the performance of base models,
instruction-tuned open-source models, and commercial models. Our evaluation
includes 6 base models and 26 instruction-tuned models. To assess the results,
we employ both human evaluation and LLM-as-a-judge methods. Human evaluation
scores showed moderate to high correlation with benchmark evaluations,
depending on the dataset. Claude 3.7 Sonnet, used as an LLM judge, demonstrated
strong alignment with human ratings, indicating that top-performing LLMs can
effectively support the evaluation of Estonian-language models.

Abstract: Objective: Emergency medical dispatch (EMD) is a high-stakes process
challenged by caller distress, ambiguity, and cognitive load. Large Language
Models (LLMs) and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) offer opportunities to augment
dispatchers. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a taxonomy-grounded,
LLM-powered multi-agent system for simulating realistic EMD scenarios. Methods:
We constructed a clinical taxonomy (32 chief complaints, 6 caller identities
from MIMIC-III) and a six-phase call protocol. Using this framework, we
developed an AutoGen-based MAS with Caller and Dispatcher Agents. The system
grounds interactions in a fact commons to ensure clinical plausibility and
mitigate misinformation. We used a hybrid evaluation framework: four physicians
assessed 100 simulated cases for "Guidance Efficacy" and "Dispatch
Effectiveness," supplemented by automated linguistic analysis (sentiment,
readability, politeness). Results: Human evaluation, with substantial
inter-rater agreement (Gwe's AC1 > 0.70), confirmed the system's high
performance. It demonstrated excellent Dispatch Effectiveness (e.g., 94 %
contacting the correct potential other agents) and Guidance Efficacy (advice
provided in 91 % of cases), both rated highly by physicians. Algorithmic
metrics corroborated these findings, indicating a predominantly neutral
affective profile (73.7 % neutral sentiment; 90.4 % neutral emotion), high
readability (Flesch 80.9), and a consistently polite style (60.0 % polite; 0 %
impolite). Conclusion: Our taxonomy-grounded MAS simulates diverse, clinically
plausible dispatch scenarios with high fidelity. Findings support its use for
dispatcher training, protocol evaluation, and as a foundation for real-time
decision support. This work outlines a pathway for safely integrating advanced
AI agents into emergency response workflows.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in natural
language generation, yet they continue to display puzzling behaviors -- such as
repetition and incoherence -- even when exhibiting low perplexity. This
highlights a key limitation of conventional evaluation metrics, which emphasize
local prediction accuracy while overlooking long-range structural complexity.
We introduce correlation dimension, a fractal-geometric measure of
self-similarity, to quantify the epistemological complexity of text as
perceived by a language model. This measure captures the hierarchical
recurrence structure of language, bridging local and global properties in a
unified framework. Through extensive experiments, we show that correlation
dimension (1) reveals three distinct phases during pretraining, (2) reflects
context-dependent complexity, (3) indicates a model's tendency toward
hallucination, and (4) reliably detects multiple forms of degeneration in
generated text. The method is computationally efficient, robust to model
quantization (down to 4-bit precision), broadly applicable across
autoregressive architectures (e.g., Transformer and Mamba), and provides fresh
insight into the generative dynamics of LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PBS-Attn的置换块稀疏注意力机制，通过利用注意力的置换特性来提高块级稀疏度，在保持模型精度的同时显著提升长上下文预填充的计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型扩展上下文长度具有显著优势但计算成本高昂，主要瓶颈在于自注意力机制的O(N^2)复杂度。虽然注意力矩阵通常是稀疏的，但现有块稀疏注意力方法在块级稀疏度方面存在优化空间。

Method: PBS-Attn是一种即插即用方法，通过置换注意力的特性来增加块级稀疏度，并配合自定义的置换FlashAttention内核实现高效计算。

Result: 在真实世界长上下文数据集上的实验表明，PBS-Attn在模型精度上持续优于现有块稀疏注意力方法，并接近全注意力基线。端到端预填充速度提升最高达2.75倍。

Conclusion: PBS-Attn是一种实用可行的注意力优化方法，能够在保持模型性能的同时显著提升长上下文处理的计算效率。

Abstract: Scaling the context length of large language models (LLMs) offers significant
benefits but is computationally expensive. This expense stems primarily from
the self-attention mechanism, whose $O(N^2)$ complexity with respect to
sequence length presents a major bottleneck for both memory and latency.
Fortunately, the attention matrix is often sparse, particularly for long
sequences, suggesting an opportunity for optimization. Block-sparse attention
has emerged as a promising solution that partitions sequences into blocks and
skips computation for a subset of these blocks. However, the effectiveness of
this method is highly dependent on the underlying attention patterns, which can
lead to sub-optimal block-level sparsity. For instance, important key tokens
for queries within a single block may be scattered across numerous other
blocks, leading to computational redundancy. In this work, we propose Permuted
Block-Sparse Attention (\textbf{PBS-Attn}), a plug-and-play method that
leverages the permutation properties of attention to increase block-level
sparsity and enhance the computational efficiency of LLM prefilling. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on challenging real-world long-context datasets,
demonstrating that PBS-Attn consistently outperforms existing block-sparse
attention methods in model accuracy and closely matches the full attention
baseline. Powered by our custom permuted-FlashAttention kernels, PBS-Attn
achieves an end-to-end speedup of up to $2.75\times$ in long-context
prefilling, confirming its practical viability. Code available at

*Yarik Menchaca Resendiz,Roman Klinger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PARL方法使用LLMs作为强化学习智能体，通过提示而非微调来处理非语言推理任务，在简单环境中与传统RL智能体表现相当或更好，但在需要复杂数学运算的任务中存在性能限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作主要评估LLMs在依赖语言表示的任务中，但缺乏对LLMs在强化学习环境中作为智能体的研究，特别是在处理结构化、非语言推理任务时。

Method: 提出PARL方法，通过提示将动作、状态和奖励编码到LLMs中，使其能够通过试错与环境交互进行学习，无需任何微调。

Result: 在三个标准RL任务中，PARL在简单环境中能够匹配或超越传统RL智能体，但在需要复杂数学运算或状态动作解码的任务中表现受限。

Conclusion: LLMs可以作为RL智能体在非语言推理任务中有效工作，但当前方法在处理复杂数学运算方面存在局限性，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated high performance on tasks
expressed in natural language, particularly in zero- or few-shot settings.
These are typically framed as supervised (e.g., classification) or unsupervised
(e.g., clustering) problems. However, limited work evaluates LLMs as agents in
reinforcement learning (RL) tasks (e.g., playing games), where learning occurs
through interaction with an environment and a reward system. While prior work
focused on representing tasks that rely on a language representation, we study
structured, non-linguistic reasoning - such as interpreting positions in a grid
world. We therefore introduce PARL (Prompt-based Agent for Reinforcement
Learning), a method that uses LLMs as RL agents through prompting, without any
fine-tuning. PARL encodes actions, states, and rewards in the prompt, enabling
the model to learn through trial-and-error interaction. We evaluate PARL on
three standard RL tasks that do not entirely rely on natural language. We show
that it can match or outperform traditional RL agents in simple environments by
leveraging pretrained knowledge. However, we identify performance limitations
in tasks that require complex mathematical operations or decoding states and
actions.

*Ji Won Park,Kyunghyun Cho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种多样性导向的采样器，通过注入语义相似性惩罚来减少冗余输出，提高不确定性估计的样本效率，无需访问基础LLM的梯度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自由形式问答中准确估计语义不确定性具有挑战性，传统方法需要大量昂贵的生成样本。

Method: 使用自然语言推理模型在解码过程中注入连续语义相似性惩罚，结合重要性重加权和方差缩减技术。

Result: 在四个QA基准测试中，该方法在相同样本数量下覆盖更多语义簇，性能匹配或超越基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架作为即插即用的增强模块，有望在风险敏感模型部署中提升不确定性估计效果。

Abstract: Accurately estimating semantic aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in large
language models (LLMs) is particularly challenging in free-form question
answering (QA), where obtaining stable estimates often requires many expensive
generations. We introduce a diversity-steered sampler that discourages
semantically redundant outputs during decoding, covers both autoregressive and
masked diffusion paradigms, and yields substantial sample-efficiency gains. The
key idea is to inject a continuous semantic-similarity penalty into the model's
proposal distribution using a natural language inference (NLI) model lightly
finetuned on partial prefixes or intermediate diffusion states. We debias
downstream uncertainty estimates with importance reweighting and shrink their
variance with control variates. Across four QA benchmarks, our method matches
or surpasses baselines while covering more semantic clusters with the same
number of samples. Being modular and requiring no gradient access to the base
LLM, the framework promises to serve as a drop-in enhancement for uncertainty
estimation in risk-sensitive model deployments.

*Gianluca Sperduti,Alejandro Moreo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究分析了英语中typoglycemia现象（单词内部字母乱序）对NLP模型的影响，发现模型对此具有较强鲁棒性，主要原因是单词混淆数量较少且上下文差异明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究NLP模型在typoglycemia现象下仍能保持良好性能的原因，理解模型对字符顺序不敏感的鲁棒性机制。

Method: 分析英国国家语料库量化单词混淆情况；评估BERT对混淆形式的消歧能力；比较在干净文本和typoglycemic文本上训练的BERT变体。

Result: 单词混淆数量相对较少，混淆单词的上下文差异明显，使得消歧变得简单；字符乱序导致的性能下降比预期要小。

Conclusion: 英语中typoglycemia导致的单词混淆有限且上下文差异大，这是NLP模型对此现象具有鲁棒性的主要原因。

Abstract: Research in linguistics has shown that humans can read words with internally
scrambled letters, a phenomenon recently dubbed typoglycemia. Some specific NLP
models have recently been proposed that similarly demonstrate robustness to
such distortions by ignoring the internal order of characters by design. This
raises a fundamental question: how can models perform well when many distinct
words (e.g., form and from) collapse into identical representations under
typoglycemia? Our work, focusing exclusively on the English language, seeks to
shed light on the underlying aspects responsible for this robustness. We
hypothesize that the main reasons have to do with the fact that (i) relatively
few English words collapse under typoglycemia, and that (ii) collapsed words
tend to occur in contexts so distinct that disambiguation becomes trivial. In
our analysis, we (i) analyze the British National Corpus to quantify word
collapse and ambiguity under typoglycemia, (ii) evaluate BERT's ability to
disambiguate collapsing forms, and (iii) conduct a probing experiment by
comparing variants of BERT trained from scratch on clean versus typoglycemic
Wikipedia text; our results reveal that the performance degradation caused by
scrambling is smaller than expected.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TripTide是首个评估LLM在现实旅行中断情况下修订行程能力的基准，涵盖中断严重程度和旅行者容忍度等关键维度，通过自动指标、LLM作为评判和专家评估三种方法进行综合评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有旅行规划系统如TripCraft和TravelPlanner虽然能够生成个性化行程，但无法有效处理现实旅行中常见的中断情况，如航班取消、天气关闭等突发事件。

Method: 采用三重评估方法：1）引入自动指标（意图保持、响应性、适应性）；2）使用LLM作为评判自动评估修订质量；3）进行手动专家评估验证修订在语义、空间、顺序和响应方面的表现。

Result: 实验显示LLM在顺序一致性和语义稳定性方面表现良好，空间偏差在短途旅行中较大但随行程延长而减小，但中断处理能力随计划长度增加而下降，表明LLM鲁棒性存在局限。

Conclusion: TripTide为评估LLM在现实不确定性下的旅行规划适应性、个性化和韧性建立了基准，揭示了当前LLM在长行程中断处理方面的局限性。

Abstract: Recent efforts like TripCraft and TravelPlanner have advanced the use of
Large Language Models ( LLMs) for personalized, constraint aware travel
itinerary generation. Yet, real travel often faces disruptions. To address
this, we present TripTide, the first benchmark evaluating LLM's ability to
revise itineraries under realistic disruptions. TripTide models key dimensions
such as disruption severity and traveler tolerance, enabling nuanced assessment
of LLM adaptability to events like flight cancellations, weather closures, or
overbooked attractions. We conduct a threefold evaluation. First, we introduce
automatic metrics including Preservation of Intent (how well the revised plan
maintains feasibility and goals), Responsiveness (promptness and
appropriateness of disruption handling), and Adaptability (semantic, spatial,
and sequential divergence between original and revised plans). Second, we apply
an LLM-as-a-judge approach to automatically assess revision quality. Third, we
perform manual expert evaluation to verify whether revisions preserve semantic,
spatial, sequential, and responsive aspects. Our experiments show that LLMs
maintain strong sequential consistency and semantic stability, while spatial
deviations are larger for shorter trips but decrease with longer ones,
indicating that extended plans encourage better geographic coherence. However,
disruption-handling ability declines as plan length increases, highlighting
limits in LLM robustness. TripTide establishes a benchmark for evaluating
adaptability, personalization, and resilience in LLM-based travel planning
under real-world uncertainty.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现单轮训练在推理任务上比多轮训练更有效，单轮训练的模型能很好泛化到单轮和多轮评估，而多轮训练的模型在单轮推理性能上显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的推理能力通常通过单轮强化学习开发，而实际应用涉及多轮人机交互，存在训练与部署条件不匹配的问题，需要研究多轮训练是否必要。

Method: 比较传统单轮训练与三种多轮训练策略，评估模型在单轮和多轮推理任务上的表现。

Result: 单轮训练模型能有效泛化到单轮和多轮评估，而多轮训练模型在单轮推理性能上显著下降，多轮训练仅带来有限收益。

Conclusion: 对于信息完整的任务，稳健的单轮训练比多轮训练更有效可靠，多轮训练可能损害推理能力。

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically
developed through the single-turn reinforcement learning, whereas real-world
applications often involve multi-turn interactions with human feedback, leading
to a potential mismatch between training and deployment conditions. In this
work, we study whether multi-turn training with human feedback is necessary for
reasoning tasks. We compare conventional single-turn training with three
multi-turn strategies and reach contrary conclusions to previous research. We
find that models trained in a single-turn setting generalize effectively to
both single- and multi-turn evaluations, while models trained with multi-turn
strategies exhibit a significant degradation in single-turn reasoning
performance. These results suggest that for tasks with complete information,
robust single-turn training remains more effective and reliable, as multi-turn
training with basic feedback provides limited benefits and can even degrade
reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: 该论文创建了一个专门针对瑞典相关人物和事件的手工编写问答基准数据集，用于测试多语言模型对瑞典特定知识的掌握程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的瑞典基准大多是翻译自美国中心的基准，不适合测试瑞典特有的相关知识，特别是那些在国际媒体中报道有限的内容。

Method: 研究人员手动编写了一个问答基准数据集，灵感来源于瑞典文化媒体名人的流行广播节目和主要体育赛事，包含英文翻译以测试跨语言事实一致性。

Result: 研究发现，具有更强瑞典覆盖度的小型模型在回忆瑞典相关事实方面与三倍大的多语言模型表现相当。持续在瑞典语上进行预训练通常能提高事实知识，但也会导致部分先前已知信息的遗忘。

Conclusion: 该数据集有潜力作为诊断工具，用于研究多语言模型中的语言适应和知识保留问题。

Abstract: Many Swedish benchmarks are translated US-centric benchmarks, and therefore
not suitable for testing knowledge that is particularly relevant, or even
specific, to Sweden. We therefore introduce a manually written
question-answering benchmark specifically targeted to Sweden-related
personalities and events, many of which receive very limited coverage in
international media. Our annotators drew inspiration from a popular radio
program featuring public figures from culture and media, as well as major
sports events in Sweden. The dataset can be used to measure factual recall
across models of varying sizes and degrees of Swedish coverage, and allows to
probe cross-lingual factual consistency as to contains English translations.
Using the dataset, we find that smaller models with stronger Swedish coverage
perform comparably to a three times larger multilingual model in recalling
Sweden-related facts. We also observe that continued pre-training on Swedish
generally improves factual knowledge but also leads to forgetting of a part of
the previously known information. These results demonstrate the dataset's
potential as a diagnostic tool for studying language adaptation and knowledge
retention in multilingual models and during language adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决形态丰富语言在大型预训练模型中代表性不足的问题，为土耳其语NLP提供首个大规模编码器模型。

Method: 使用312GB土耳其语文本（mC4、OSCAR23、维基百科）从头训练RoBERTa模型，提供基础和大型两种配置。

Result: SindBERT在词性标注、命名实体识别、冒犯性语言检测和TurBLiMP基准测试中表现优异，大型模型在4项任务中的2项取得最佳成绩，但没有一致的扩展优势。

Conclusion: SindBERT为土耳其语NLP提供了开放资源，同时揭示了在形态丰富语言中模型扩展的局限性以及语料组成的关键作用。

Abstract: Transformer models have revolutionized NLP, yet many morphologically rich
languages remain underrepresented in large-scale pre-training efforts. With
SindBERT, we set out to chart the seas of Turkish NLP, providing the first
large-scale RoBERTa-based encoder for Turkish. Trained from scratch on 312 GB
of Turkish text (mC4, OSCAR23, Wikipedia), SindBERT is released in both base
and large configurations, representing the first large-scale encoder-only
language model available for Turkish. We evaluate SindBERT on part-of-speech
tagging, named entity recognition, offensive language detection, and the
TurBLiMP linguistic acceptability benchmark. Our results show that SindBERT
performs competitively with existing Turkish and multilingual models, with the
large variant achieving the best scores in two of four tasks but showing no
consistent scaling advantage overall. This flat scaling trend, also observed
for XLM-R and EuroBERT, suggests that current Turkish benchmarks may already be
saturated. At the same time, comparisons with smaller but more curated models
such as BERTurk highlight that corpus quality and diversity can outweigh sheer
data volume. Taken together, SindBERT contributes both as an openly released
resource for Turkish NLP and as an empirical case study on the limits of
scaling and the central role of corpus composition in morphologically rich
languages. The SindBERT models are released under the MIT license and made
available in both fairseq and Huggingface formats.

Abstract: As generative AI continues to evolve, Vision Language Models (VLMs) have
emerged as promising tools in various healthcare applications. One area that
remains relatively underexplored is their use in human activity recognition
(HAR) for remote health monitoring. VLMs offer notable strengths, including
greater flexibility and the ability to overcome some of the constraints of
traditional deep learning models. However, a key challenge in applying VLMs to
HAR lies in the difficulty of evaluating their dynamic and often
non-deterministic outputs. To address this gap, we introduce a descriptive
caption data set and propose comprehensive evaluation methods to evaluate VLMs
in HAR. Through comparative experiments with state-of-the-art deep learning
models, our findings demonstrate that VLMs achieve comparable performance and,
in some cases, even surpass conventional approaches in terms of accuracy. This
work contributes a strong benchmark and opens new possibilities for the
integration of VLMs into intelligent healthcare systems.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of wearable devices in our daily lives, the
demand and appeal for remote patient monitoring have significantly increased.
Most research in this field has concentrated on collecting sensor data,
visualizing it, and analyzing it to detect anomalies in specific diseases such
as diabetes, heart disease and depression. However, this domain has a notable
gap in the aspect of human-machine interaction. This paper proposes REMONI, an
autonomous REmote health MONItoring system that integrates multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), the Internet of Things (IoT), and wearable devices.
The system automatically and continuously collects vital signs, accelerometer
data from a special wearable (such as a smartwatch), and visual data in patient
video clips collected from cameras. This data is processed by an anomaly
detection module, which includes a fall detection model and algorithms to
identify and alert caregivers of the patient's emergency conditions. A
distinctive feature of our proposed system is the natural language processing
component, developed with MLLMs capable of detecting and recognizing a
patient's activity and emotion while responding to healthcare worker's
inquiries. Additionally, prompt engineering is employed to integrate all
patient information seamlessly. As a result, doctors and nurses can access
real-time vital signs and the patient's current state and mood by interacting
with an intelligent agent through a user-friendly web application. Our
experiments demonstrate that our system is implementable and scalable for
real-life scenarios, potentially reducing the workload of medical professionals
and healthcare costs. A full-fledged prototype illustrating the functionalities
of the system has been developed and being tested to demonstrate the robustness
of its various capabilities.

Motivation: 扩散语言模型在推理性能上落后于自回归大语言模型，主要原因是去噪过程中token的独立生成未能捕捉token相关性。

Result: MRO不仅提高了推理性能，还在保持推理基准高表现的同时实现了显著的采样加速。

Conclusion: 增强token相关性是提升扩散语言模型推理性能的关键，MRO方法有效解决了这一挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion language models (DLMs) have presented a
promising alternative to traditional autoregressive large language models
(LLMs). However, DLMs still lag behind LLMs in reasoning performance,
especially as the number of denoising steps decreases. Our analysis reveals
that this shortcoming arises primarily from the independent generation of
masked tokens across denoising steps, which fails to capture the token
correlation. In this paper, we define two types of token correlation:
intra-sequence correlation and inter-sequence correlation, and demonstrate that
enhancing these correlations improves reasoning performance. To this end, we
propose a Multi-Reward Optimization (MRO) approach, which encourages DLMs to
consider the token correlation during the denoising process. More specifically,
our MRO approach leverages test-time scaling, reject sampling, and
reinforcement learning to directly optimize the token correlation with multiple
elaborate rewards. Additionally, we introduce group step and importance
sampling strategies to mitigate reward variance and enhance sampling
efficiency. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MRO not only
improves reasoning performance but also achieves significant sampling speedups
while maintaining high performance on reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: 多参与者脑调谐在神经科学和AI之间建立了双向受益关系，通过脑数据训练可获得更通用的语义表示，有助于弥合两个领域之间的差距。

Abstract: Pretrained language models are remarkably effective in aligning with human
brain responses elicited by natural language stimuli, positioning them as
promising model organisms for studying language processing in the brain.
However, existing approaches for both estimating and improving this brain
alignment are participant-dependent and highly affected by the amount of data
available per participant, hindering both generalization to new participants
and population-level analyses. In this work, we address these limitations by
introducing a scalable, generalizable brain-tuning method, in which we
fine-tune pretrained speech language models to jointly predict fMRI responses
from multiple participants. We demonstrate that the resulting brain-tuned
models exhibit strong individual brain alignment while generalizing across
participants. Specifically, our method leads to 1) a 5-fold decrease in the
amount of fMRI data needed to predict brain data from new participants, 2) up
to a 50% increase in the overall brain alignment, and 3) strong generalization
to new unseen datasets. Furthermore, this multi-participant brain-tuning
additionally improves downstream performance on semantic tasks, suggesting that
training using brain data from multiple participants leads to more
generalizable semantic representations. Taken together, these findings
demonstrate a bidirectional benefit between neuroscience and AI, helping bridge
the gap between the two fields. We make our code and models publicly available

Conclusion: 机制信号是RAG系统中幻觉检测的高效、可泛化预测因子，为幻觉检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external knowledge to
mitigate hallucinations, yet models often generate outputs inconsistent with
retrieved content. Accurate hallucination detection requires disentangling the
contributions of external context and parametric knowledge, which prior methods
typically conflate. We investigate the mechanisms underlying RAG hallucinations
and find they arise when later-layer FFN modules disproportionately inject
parametric knowledge into the residual stream. To address this, we explore a
mechanistic detection approach based on external context scores and parametric
knowledge scores. Using Qwen3-0.6b, we compute these scores across layers and
attention heads and train regression-based classifiers to predict
hallucinations. Our method is evaluated against state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-5,
GPT-4.1) and detection baselines (RAGAS, TruLens, RefChecker). Furthermore,
classifiers trained on Qwen3-0.6b signals generalize to GPT-4.1-mini responses,
demonstrating the potential of proxy-model evaluation. Our results highlight
mechanistic signals as efficient, generalizable predictors for hallucination
detection in RAG systems.

Abstract: We apply category theory to extract multimodal document structure which leads
us to develop information theoretic measures, content summarization and
extension, and self-supervised improvement of large pretrained models. We first
develop a mathematical representation of a document as a category of
question-answer pairs. Second, we develop an orthogonalization procedure to
divide the information contained in one or more documents into non-overlapping
pieces. The structures extracted in the first and second steps lead us to
develop methods to measure and enumerate the information contained in a
document. We also build on those steps to develop new summarization techniques,
as well as to develop a solution to a new problem viz. exegesis resulting in an
extension of the original document. Our question-answer pair methodology
enables a novel rate distortion analysis of summarization techniques. We
implement our techniques using large pretrained models, and we propose a
multimodal extension of our overall mathematical framework. Finally, we develop
a novel self-supervised method using RLVR to improve large pretrained models
using consistency constraints such as composability and closure under certain
operations that stem naturally from our category theoretic framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型是否对语言谱系结构敏感，以及这种结构如何影响模型的多语言行为

Method: 通过分析MultiQ数据集，检查模型在提示语言保真度不维持时是否倾向于切换到谱系相关语言，并研究知识一致性在谱系内外的差异

Result: 发现谱系级别效应存在但强烈受训练资源可用性影响，不同LLM家族表现出不同的多语言策略

Conclusion: LLMs编码了谱系级别结构的某些方面，但训练数据不平衡仍是塑造其多语言性能的主要因素

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display notable variation in multilingual
behavior, yet the role of genealogical language structure in shaping this
variation remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs
exhibit sensitivity to linguistic genera by extending prior analyses on the
MultiQ dataset. We first check if models prefer to switch to genealogically
related languages when prompt language fidelity is not maintained. Next, we
investigate whether knowledge consistency is better preserved within than
across genera. We show that genus-level effects are present but strongly
conditioned by training resource availability. We further observe distinct
multilingual strategies across LLMs families. Our findings suggest that LLMs
encode aspects of genus-level structure, but training data imbalances remain
the primary factor shaping their multilingual performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型能力的提升，需要更挑战性的评估来测试超越表面语言能力的语用学理解，即理解情境意义、语境以及语言文化规范的能力。

Method: 构建了包含405个选择题的语用理解基准，讨论了翻译困难，建立了人类基线，并对LLM进行了试点评估。

Result: 当前模型在理解细微语言方面有很大改进，但在推断非字面表达中隐含的说话者意义时仍会失败，特别是文化特定的表达。发现专有模型和开源模型之间存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 针对细微语言理解和目标文化知识的基准必须精心设计，最好从本地数据构建，并用人类响应进行验证。

Abstract: Large language models are demonstrating increasing capabilities, excelling at
benchmarks once considered very difficult. As their capabilities grow, there is
a need for more challenging evaluations that go beyond surface-level linguistic
competence. Namely, language competence involves not only syntax and semantics
but also pragmatics, i.e., understanding situational meaning as shaped by
context as well as linguistic and cultural norms. To contribute to this line of
research, we introduce SloPragEval and SloPragMega, the first pragmatics
understanding benchmarks for Slovene that contain altogether 405
multiple-choice questions. We discuss the difficulties of translation, describe
the campaign to establish a human baseline, and report pilot evaluations with
LLMs. Our results indicate that current models have greatly improved in
understanding nuanced language but may still fail to infer implied speaker
meaning in non-literal utterances, especially those that are culture-specific.
We also observe a significant gap between proprietary and open-source models.
Finally, we argue that benchmarks targeting nuanced language understanding and
knowledge of the target culture must be designed with care, preferably
constructed from native data, and validated with human responses.

Motivation: 语言文档中的词汇数据收集常包含转录错误和未记录的借词，这些会误导语言分析，需要系统方法来识别这些音系不一致性。

Method: 使用字符级和音节级音系特征的无监督异常检测算法，识别潜在的转录错误和借词。

Result: 音节感知特征显著优于字符级基线方法，虽然精确率和召回率因异常性质微妙而保持适中，但高召回方法能为田野工作者提供系统标记需验证条目的工具。

Conclusion: 该方法为低资源语言文档提供了支持数据质量改进的系统方法，能有效标记需要验证的词汇条目。

Abstract: Lexical data collection in language documentation often contains
transcription errors and undocumented borrowings that can mislead linguistic
analysis. We present unsupervised anomaly detection methods to identify
phonotactic inconsistencies in wordlists, applying them to a multilingual
dataset of Kokborok varieties with Bangla. Using character-level and
syllable-level phonotactic features, our algorithms identify potential
transcription errors and borrowings. While precision and recall remain modest
due to the subtle nature of these anomalies, syllable-aware features
significantly outperform character-level baselines. The high-recall approach
provides fieldworkers with a systematic method to flag entries requiring
verification, supporting data quality improvement in low-resourced language
documentation.

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding
reasoning capabilities on mathematical and coding tasks. However, their
application to financial tasks-especially the most fundamental task of stock
movement prediction-remains underexplored. We study a three-class
classification problem (up, hold, down) and, by analyzing existing reasoning
responses, observe that: (1) LLMs follow analysts' opinions rather than exhibit
a systematic, independent analytical logic (CoTs). (2) LLMs list summaries from
different sources without weighing adversarial evidence, yet such
counterevidence is crucial for reliable prediction. It shows that the model
does not make good use of its reasoning ability to complete the task. To
address this, we propose Reflective Evidence Tuning (RETuning), a cold-start
method prior to reinforcement learning, to enhance prediction ability. While
generating CoT, RETuning encourages dynamically constructing an analytical
framework from diverse information sources, organizing and scoring evidence for
price up or down based on that framework-rather than on contextual
viewpoints-and finally reflecting to derive the prediction. This approach
maximally aligns the model with its learned analytical framework, ensuring
independent logical reasoning and reducing undue influence from context. We
also build a large-scale dataset spanning all of 2024 for 5,123 A-share stocks,
with long contexts (32K tokens) and over 200K samples. In addition to price and
news, it incorporates analysts' opinions, quantitative reports, fundamental
data, macroeconomic indicators, and similar stocks. Experiments show that
RETuning successfully unlocks the model's reasoning ability in the financial
domain. Inference-time scaling still works even after 6 months or on
out-of-distribution stocks, since the models gain valuable insights about stock
movement prediction.

Abstract: Understanding how information is dynamically accumulated and transformed in
human reasoning has long challenged cognitive psychology, philosophy, and
artificial intelligence. Existing accounts, from classical logic to
probabilistic models, illuminate aspects of output or individual modelling, but
do not offer a unified, quantitative description of general human reasoning
dynamics. To solve this, we introduce Information Flow Tracking (IF-Track),
that uses large language models (LLMs) as probabilistic encoder to quantify
information entropy and gain at each reasoning step. Through fine-grained
analyses across diverse tasks, our method is the first successfully models the
universal landscape of human reasoning behaviors within a single metric space.
We show that IF-Track captures essential reasoning features, identifies
systematic error patterns, and characterizes individual differences. Applied to
discussion of advanced psychological theory, we first reconcile single- versus
dual-process theories in IF-Track and discover the alignment of artificial and
human cognition and how LLMs reshaping human reasoning process. This approach
establishes a quantitative bridge between theory and measurement, offering
mechanistic insights into the architecture of reasoning.

TL;DR: CESAR通过在线强化学习框架解决音频大语言模型中的推理逆缩放问题，从结果验证转向奖励推理过程，实现了最先进的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频大语言模型中的推理能力研究不足，传统方法在推理过程中会出现性能下降的逆缩放现象，这源于缺乏对推理过程的适当训练指导。

Method: 采用在线强化学习框架，使用Group Relative Policy Optimization和多方面奖励机制，奖励正确性、格式、一致性、结构化分析模式、因果推理、领域知识整合和校准推理深度。

Result: 解决了测试时逆缩放问题，在MMAU Test-mini上达到最先进水平，显著优于Gemini 2.5 Pro和GPT-4o Audio，在MMSU推理任务上接近人类水平。

Conclusion: CESAR为开发稳健可扩展的音频LLM推理能力建立了原则性方法，增强的推理能力同时改善了多模态推理和感知能力。

Abstract: The role of reasoning in Audio Large Language Models remains widely
underexplored, as introducing a reasoning process often degrades rather than
improves performance during inference, a phenomenon we term test-time inverse
scaling, where longer reasoning chains yield progressively worse results. We
demonstrate that this stems not from fundamental limitations of reasoning
itself, but from inadequate training: models without proper guidance for the
reasoning process produce hallucinatory, inconsistent reasoning that
accumulates errors over longer chains. To address these challenges, we
introduce CESAR (Consistent, Effective, and Scalable Audio Reasoners), shifting
from outcome verification to rewarding the reasoning process. Our online
reinforcement learning framework employs Group Relative Policy Optimization
with a multi-faceted reward suite that incentivizes not only correctness and
format but also consistency, structured analytical patterns, causal reasoning,
domain-knowledge integration, and calibrated reasoning depth. CESAR resolves
test-time inverse scaling, transforming reasoning from detriments into gains
while revealing model-specific ``reasoning sweet spots", where performance
peaks during test-time scaling. We achieve state-of-the-art results on MMAU
Test-mini, substantially outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4o Audio, and
near-human-level performance on MMSU reasoning tasks. Through AI-as-judge
evaluations and qualitative comparisons, we provide both quantitative and
qualitative validation of our improved reasoning quality. Importantly, enhanced
reasoning creates synergistic effects, simultaneously improving multimodal
reasoning and perception capabilities. Overall, CESAR establishes a principled
method for developing robust and scalable reasoning in Audio LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图的时空学习方法依赖预定义的图拓扑结构，无法适应市场动态在不同危机机制（信用传染、疫情冲击、通胀驱动抛售）下的变化，导致资产相关性结构预测不准确。

Method: 使用图卷积网络编码空间关系，BiLSTM与自注意力机制捕捉时间动态，通过多头图注意力网络学习稀疏结构，过滤92.5%的噪声连接，保留危机相关依赖关系。

Result: 在2005-2021年数据上训练，在2022-2024年通胀驱动市场（完全不同机制）上实现稳健泛化，夏普比率达3.76，比等权重基准提高707%，比静态图方法提高94%。

Conclusion: CRISP通过自适应学习而非强加假设，实现了跨危机机制的稳健预测，注意力权重提供了可解释的机制检测，学习到的防御性集群注意力在危机期间增强49%。

Abstract: Financial time series forecasting faces a fundamental challenge: predicting
optimal asset allocations requires understanding regime-dependent correlation
structures that transform during crisis periods. Existing graph-based
spatio-temporal learning approaches rely on predetermined graph
topologies--correlation thresholds, sector classifications--that fail to adapt
when market dynamics shift across different crisis mechanisms: credit
contagion, pandemic shocks, or inflation-driven selloffs.
  We present CRISP (Crisis-Resilient Investment through Spatio-temporal
Patterns), a graph-based spatio-temporal learning framework that encodes
spatial relationships via Graph Convolutional Networks and temporal dynamics
via BiLSTM with self-attention, then learns sparse structures through
multi-head Graph Attention Networks. Unlike fixed-topology methods, CRISP
discovers which asset relationships matter through attention mechanisms,
filtering 92.5% of connections as noise while preserving crisis-relevant
dependencies for accurate regime-specific predictions.
  Trained on 2005--2021 data encompassing credit and pandemic crises, CRISP
demonstrates robust generalization to 2022--2024 inflation-driven markets--a
fundamentally different regime--by accurately forecasting regime-appropriate
correlation structures. This enables adaptive portfolio allocation that
maintains profitability during downturns, achieving Sharpe ratio 3.76: 707%
improvement over equal-weight baselines and 94% improvement over static graph
methods. Learned attention weights provide interpretable regime detection, with
defensive cluster attention strengthening 49% during crises versus 31%
market-wide--emergent behavior from learning to forecast rather than imposing
assumptions.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a powerful tool for optimizing expensive
black-box objective functions. While extensive research has been conducted on
the single-objective optimization problem, the multi-objective optimization
problem remains challenging. In this paper, we propose MOBO-OSD, a
multi-objective Bayesian Optimization algorithm designed to generate a diverse
set of Pareto optimal solutions by solving multiple constrained optimization
problems, referred to as MOBO-OSD subproblems, along orthogonal search
directions (OSDs) defined with respect to an approximated convex hull of
individual objective minima. By employing a well-distributed set of OSDs,
MOBO-OSD ensures broad coverage of the objective space, enhancing both solution
diversity and hypervolume performance. To further improve the density of the
set of Pareto optimal candidate solutions without requiring an excessive number
of subproblems, we leverage a Pareto Front Estimation technique to generate
additional solutions in the neighborhood of existing solutions. Additionally,
MOBO-OSD supports batch optimization, enabling parallel function evaluations to
accelerate the optimization process when resources are available. Through
extensive experiments and analysis on a variety of synthetic and real-world
benchmark functions with two to six objectives, we demonstrate that MOBO-OSD
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms. Our code
implementation can be found at https://github.com/LamNgo1/mobo-osd.

Conclusion: 负学习范式为多模态学习提供了新视角，能够有效解决模态不平衡问题，同时保留各模态的独特信息。

Abstract: Multimodal learning systems often encounter challenges related to modality
imbalance, where a dominant modality may overshadow others, thereby hindering
the learning of weak modalities. Conventional approaches often force weak
modalities to align with dominant ones in "Learning to be (the same)" (Positive
Learning), which risks suppressing the unique information inherent in the weak
modalities. To address this challenge, we offer a new learning paradigm:
"Learning Not to be" (Negative Learning). Instead of enhancing weak modalities'
target-class predictions, the dominant modalities dynamically guide the weak
modality to suppress non-target classes. This stabilizes the decision space and
preserves modality-specific information, allowing weak modalities to preserve
unique information without being over-aligned. We proceed to reveal multimodal
learning from a robustness perspective and theoretically derive the Multimodal
Negative Learning (MNL) framework, which introduces a dynamic guidance
mechanism tailored for negative learning. Our method provably tightens the
robustness lower bound of multimodal learning by increasing the Unimodal
Confidence Margin (UCoM) and reduces the empirical error of weak modalities,
particularly under noisy and imbalanced scenarios. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
approach against competing methods. The code will be available at

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves model output accuracy by
leveraging external knowledge bases, serving as an effective solution to
address hallucination issues and knowledge-update delays in Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, the introduction of external knowledge bases presents
RAG with challenges in long-context processing, significantly increasing memory
consumption and inference latency. Existing research accelerates inference by
precomputing Key and Value (KV) of the knowledge base and loading them
on-demand during inference. Based on the access frequency of different KV
chunks within the external knowledge base, this paper proposes a hotness-aware
RAG (HA-RAG) inference optimization system. First, leveraging the numerical
distribution of KV chunks, we introduce a hotness-aware mixed-precision
compressing and loading method to reduce disk I/O and memory access overhead.
Second, we design a hotness-aware data placement strategy that prioritizes
storing frequently accessed KV chunks in high-speed memory to improve data
access efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with
TurboRAG, the proposed HA-RAG achieves an average speedup of 2.10x and maximum
speedup of 10.49x in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) with negligible accuracy loss.

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants enable modern artificial
intelligence. However, theoretical understanding lags far behind their
empirical success. It is widely believed that SGD has a curious ability to
avoid sharp local minima in the loss landscape, which are associated with poor
generalization. To unravel this mystery and further enhance such capability of
SGDs, it is imperative to go beyond the traditional local convergence analysis
and obtain a comprehensive understanding of SGDs' global dynamics. In this
paper, we develop a set of technical machinery based on the recent large
deviations and metastability analysis in Wang and Rhee (2023) and obtain sharp
characterization of the global dynamics of heavy-tailed SGDs. In particular, we
reveal a fascinating phenomenon in deep learning: by injecting and then
truncating heavy-tailed noises during the training phase, SGD can almost
completely avoid sharp minima and achieve better generalization performance for
the test data. Simulation and deep learning experiments confirm our theoretical
prediction that heavy-tailed SGD with gradient clipping finds local minima with
a more flat geometry and achieves better generalization performance.

Abstract: We study the problem of regression with interval targets, where only upper
and lower bounds on target values are available in the form of intervals. This
problem arises when the exact target label is expensive or impossible to
obtain, due to inherent uncertainties. In the absence of exact targets,
traditional regression loss functions cannot be used. First, we study the
methodology of using a loss functions compatible with interval targets, for
which we establish non-asymptotic generalization bounds based on smoothness of
the hypothesis class that significantly relaxing prior assumptions of
realizability and small ambiguity degree. Second, we propose a novel min-max
learning formulation: minimize against the worst-case (maximized) target labels
within the provided intervals. The maximization problem in the latter is
non-convex, but we show that good performance can be achieved with the
incorporation of smoothness constraints. Finally, we perform extensive
experiments on real-world datasets and show that our methods achieve
state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 提出了基于元学习的蛋白质突变性质预测方法，通过MAML实现跨数据集快速适应，并创新性地使用分隔符标记编码突变信息，显著提升了预测准确性和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖针对特定数据集的微调，在跨数据集泛化方面表现不佳，主要受限于异构实验条件和目标域数据不足的问题。

Method: 结合Transformer架构与模型无关元学习（MAML），采用分隔符标记直接编码突变到序列上下文中，实现通过少量梯度步骤快速适应新任务。

Result: 在三个蛋白质突变数据集（功能适应性、热稳定性和溶解度）上的评估显示，相比传统微调方法，元学习方法在功能适应性预测上准确率提升29%，训练时间减少65%；在溶解度预测上准确率提升94%，训练时间减少55%。

Conclusion: 该工作建立了元学习在蛋白质突变分析中的系统应用，提供了有效的突变编码策略，为蛋白质工程中的跨域泛化提供了变革性方法。

Abstract: Protein mutations can have profound effects on biological function, making
accurate prediction of property changes critical for drug discovery, protein
engineering, and precision medicine. Current approaches rely on fine-tuning
protein-specific transformers for individual datasets, but struggle with
cross-dataset generalization due to heterogeneous experimental conditions and
limited target domain data. We introduce two key innovations: (1) the first
application of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to protein mutation property
prediction, and (2) a novel mutation encoding strategy using separator tokens
to directly incorporate mutations into sequence context. We build upon
transformer architectures integrating them with MAML to enable rapid adaptation
to new tasks through minimal gradient steps rather than learning
dataset-specific patterns. Our mutation encoding addresses the critical
limitation where standard transformers treat mutation positions as unknown
tokens, significantly degrading performance. Evaluation across three diverse
protein mutation datasets (functional fitness, thermal stability, and
solubility) demonstrates significant advantages over traditional fine-tuning.
In cross-task evaluation, our meta-learning approach achieves 29% better
accuracy for functional fitness with 65% less training time, and 94% better
accuracy for solubility with 55% faster training. The framework maintains
consistent training efficiency regardless of dataset size, making it
particularly valuable for industrial applications and early-stage protein
design where experimental data is limited. This work establishes a systematic
application of meta-learning to protein mutation analysis and introduces an
effective mutation encoding strategy, offering transformative methodology for
cross-domain generalization in protein engineering.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出LLM集成贝叶斯状态空间模型(LBS)，结合结构化时间序列数据和非结构化文本信息进行多模态时序预测，支持灵活的回溯和预测窗口，并提供不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在固定输入/输出视野、无法建模或量化不确定性方面的架构限制，实现结构化时间序列数据与非结构化文本信息的有效整合。

Method: LBS包含两个组件：(1)状态空间模型(SSM)骨干网络捕捉潜在状态的时间动态；(2)预训练大语言模型(LLM)编码文本输入进行后验状态估计，并解码与潜在轨迹一致的文本预测。

Result: 在TextTimeCorpus基准测试中，LBS将先前最先进方法提升了13.20%，同时为每个预测提供人类可读的摘要。

Conclusion: 这是首个将LLM和SSM统一用于联合数值和文本预测的工作，为多模态时序推理提供了新的基础。

Abstract: Forecasting in the real world requires integrating structured time-series
data with unstructured textual information, but existing methods are
architecturally limited by fixed input/output horizons and are unable to model
or quantify uncertainty. We address this challenge by introducing
LLM-integrated Bayesian State space models (LBS), a novel probabilistic
framework for multimodal temporal forecasting. At a high level, LBS consists of
two components: (1) a state space model (SSM) backbone that captures the
temporal dynamics of latent states from which both numerical and textual
observations are generated and (2) a pretrained large language model (LLM) that
is adapted to encode textual inputs for posterior state estimation and decode
textual forecasts consistent with the latent trajectory. This design enables
flexible lookback and forecast windows, principled uncertainty quantification,
and improved temporal generalization thanks to the well-suited inductive bias
of SSMs toward modeling dynamical systems. Experiments on the TextTimeCorpus
benchmark demonstrate that LBS improves the previous state-of-the-art by 13.20%
while providing human-readable summaries of each forecast. Our work is the
first to unify LLMs and SSMs for joint numerical and textual prediction,
offering a novel foundation for multimodal temporal reasoning.

*Jeff Pflueger,Michael Everett*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可逆性的安全强化学习方法，使用模型预测路径积分控制来检查学习策略提出的动作安全性，无需显式动态模型或安全约束知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无模型强化学习缺乏正式安全保证，现有方法通常需要详细的安全规范知识。许多难以明确规范的安全问题最好通过不变性来表征。

Method: 利用可逆性作为防止安全问题的机制，使用模型预测路径积分控制在整个训练过程中检查学习策略提出的动作安全性，仅需查询黑盒动态。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提算法在所有不安全动作之前成功中止，同时达到与允许违反安全的基线PPO方法相当的训练进度。

Conclusion: 基于可逆性的方法能够有效防止安全问题，仅需查询黑盒动态即可实现安全强化学习，无需显式动态模型或安全约束知识。

Abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning approaches are promising for control but
typically lack formal safety guarantees. Existing methods to shield or
otherwise provide these guarantees often rely on detailed knowledge of the
safety specifications. Instead, this work's insight is that many
difficult-to-specify safety issues are best characterized by invariance.
Accordingly, we propose to leverage reversibility as a method for preventing
these safety issues throughout the training process. Our method uses
model-predictive path integral control to check the safety of an action
proposed by a learned policy throughout training. A key advantage of this
approach is that it only requires the ability to query the black-box dynamics,
not explicit knowledge of the dynamics or safety constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm successfully aborts before all
unsafe actions, while still achieving comparable training progress to a
baseline PPO approach that is allowed to violate safety.

Conclusion: EPFL为医疗环境中的跌倒检测提供了可扩展、安全且准确的解决方案，通过自适应反馈机制具有持续改进的潜力。

Abstract: Falls among elderly and disabled individuals remain a leading cause of injury
and mortality worldwide, necessitating robust, accurate, and privacy-aware fall
detection systems. Traditional fall detection approaches, whether centralized
or point-wise, often struggle with key challenges such as limited
generalizability, data privacy concerns, and variability in individual movement
behaviors. To address these limitations, we propose EPFL-an Ensembled Penalized
Federated Learning framework that integrates continual learning, personalized
modeling, and a novel Specialized Weighted Aggregation (SWA) strategy. EPFL
leverages wearable sensor data to capture sequential motion patterns while
preserving user privacy through homomorphic encryption and federated training.
Unlike existing federated models, EPFL incorporates both penalized local
training and ensemble-based inference to improve inter-client consistency and
adaptability to behavioral differences. Extensive experiments on a benchmark
fall detection dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving
a Recall of 88.31 percent and an F1-score of 89.94 percent, significantly
outperforming both centralized and baseline models. This work presents a
scalable, secure, and accurate solution for real-world fall detection in
healthcare settings, with strong potential for continuous improvement via its
adaptive feedback mechanism.

Conclusion: 这些库为RNN研究提供了统一的测试平台，促进了模型的可重复性和进一步探索。

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a cornerstone of sequence modeling
across various scientific and industrial applications. Owing to their
versatility, numerous RNN variants have been proposed over the past decade,
aiming to improve the modeling of long-term dependencies and to address
challenges such as vanishing and exploding gradients. However, no central
library is available to test these variations, and reimplementing diverse
architectures can be time-consuming and error-prone, limiting reproducibility
and exploration. Here, we introduce three open-source libraries in Julia and
Python that centralize numerous recurrent cell implementations and higher-level
recurrent architectures. torchrecurrent, RecurrentLayers.jl, and
LuxRecurrentLayers.jl offer a consistent framework for constructing and
extending RNN models, providing built-in mechanisms for customization and

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的协作式多智能体辩论协议ColMAD，将辩论重新定义为非零和博弈，通过鼓励智能体以支持性方式相互批评来改善错误检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MAD协议将辩论视为零和博弈，导致辩论者倾向于误导裁判而非寻求真相，出现'辩论黑客'现象，反而引入更多错误并表现不如单智能体方法。

Method: 引入协作式MAD协议ColMAD，鼓励多个智能体以支持性方式相互批评，互相补充缺失的观点，使裁判智能体能够基于更全面的证据做出更明智的结论。

Result: 实验表明，ColMAD比之前的竞争性MAD性能提升19%，在错误检测任务上相比单智能体方法带来了显著改进。

Conclusion: 将多智能体辩论重新定义为非零和博弈能够有效缓解辩论黑客问题，显著提升大规模语言模型错误检测的效果，为可扩展监督提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate detection of errors in large language models (LLM) responses is
central to the success of scalable oversight, or providing effective
supervision to superhuman intelligence. Yet, self-diagnosis is often unreliable
on complex tasks unless aided by reliable external feedback. Multi-agent debate
(MAD) seems to be a natural alternative to external feedback: multiple LLMs
provide complementary perspectives and cross-checks for error detection.
However, prior MAD protocols frame debate as a zero-sum game, where the
debaters compete to win the game instead of seeking the truth. Consequently, it
leads to debate hacking: debaters tend to mislead the judge by misinterpreting
the task or presenting overconfident claims, which introduce more mistakes and
underperform single-agent methods. To mitigate the issue, we introduce a new
collaborative MAD protocol, termed ColMAD, that reframes MAD as a non-zero sum
game. Specifically, ColMAD encourages multiple agents to criticize each other
in a supportive way, such that they can complement the missing points of each
other. Therefore, the judge agent can make a more informative conclusion based
on more comprehensive evidence. Empirically, we show that ColMAD significantly
outperforms previous competitive MAD by 19% and brings non-trivial improvements
over single-agent methods in error detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有互信息估计方法存在两极分化：要么使用需要大量数据的复杂神经网络模型，要么使用无法捕捉复杂分布的过度简化模型，需要找到更好的平衡点。

Method: 基于向量copula理论，在复杂神经网络模型和简化高斯模型之间进行原则性插值，实现复杂度与容量的更好权衡。

Result: 在先进的合成基准测试和包含多种模态的真实世界数据实验中，所提出的估计器展现出优势。

Conclusion: 基于向量copula理论的互信息估计方法能够在模型复杂度和估计能力之间实现更好的平衡，是一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating mutual information (MI) is a fundamental task in data science and
machine learning. Existing estimators mainly rely on either highly flexible
models (e.g., neural networks), which require large amounts of data, or overly
simplified models (e.g., Gaussian copula), which fail to capture complex
distributions. Drawing upon recent vector copula theory, we propose a
principled interpolation between these two extremes to achieve a better
trade-off between complexity and capacity. Experiments on state-of-the-art
synthetic benchmarks and real-world data with diverse modalities demonstrate
the advantages of the proposed estimator.

TL;DR: 该论文评估了隐式神经表示(INRs)在血流动力学场压缩和心血管解剖表示中的性能，通过多种策略缓解频谱偏差，在主动脉血流场中实现了高达230的压缩比，在48个胸主动脉解剖结构中平均误差低于0.5mm。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估INRs在特定领域应用中的准确性，特别是在血流动力学场压缩和心血管解剖表示方面的性能表现。

Method: 使用专门的激活函数、固定和可训练的位置编码、非线性核的线性组合等策略来缓解频谱偏差，评估SIREN、MFN-Gabor和MHE等架构的性能。

Result: 在胸主动脉血流场中实现约230的压缩比，压力最大绝对误差1mmHg，速度误差5-10cm/s；在48个胸主动脉解剖结构中，平均和最大绝对解剖差异分别低于0.5mm和1.6mm。

Conclusion: SIREN、MFN-Gabor和MHE架构表现最佳，INRs在血流动力学场压缩和解剖表示方面具有高效率和准确性。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs, also known as neural fields) have
recently emerged as a powerful framework for knowledge representation,
synthesis, and compression. By encoding fields as continuous functions within
the weights and biases of deep neural networks-rather than relying on voxel- or
mesh-based structured or unstructured representations-INRs offer both
resolution independence and high memory efficiency. However, their accuracy in
domain-specific applications remains insufficiently understood. In this work,
we assess the performance of state-of-the-art INRs for compressing hemodynamic
fields derived from numerical simulations and for representing cardiovascular
anatomies via signed distance functions. We investigate several strategies to
mitigate spectral bias, including specialized activation functions, both fixed
and trainable positional encoding, and linear combinations of nonlinear
kernels. On realistic, space- and time-varying hemodynamic fields in the
thoracic aorta, INRs achieved remarkable compression ratios of up to
approximately 230, with maximum absolute errors of 1 mmHg for pressure and 5-10
cm/s for velocity, without extensive hyperparameter tuning. Across 48 thoracic
aortic anatomies, the average and maximum absolute anatomical discrepancies
were below 0.5 mm and 1.6 mm, respectively. Overall, the SIREN, MFN-Gabor, and
MHE architectures demonstrated the best performance. Source code and data is

TL;DR: L2M3OF是首个用于金属有机框架（MOF）的多模态大语言模型，通过整合晶体结构表示学习和语言理解，在材料特性预测和知识生成任务中超越了仅基于文本的闭源LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在自然语言任务中表现出色，但在科学发现领域的突破有限，因为理解复杂物理现象需要超越语言的多模态表示。MOF材料设计尤其具有挑战性，其三维原子排列和配位几何规则难以用语言表示，且依赖难以文本化的专家知识。

Method: L2M3OF整合了晶体表示学习和语言理解，处理结构、文本和知识模态。使用预训练的晶体编码器和轻量级投影层将结构信息压缩到标记空间，实现与语言指令的高效对齐。构建了结构-属性-知识数据库进行训练和评估。

Result: 实验表明，L2M3OF在材料特性预测和知识生成任务中超越了GPT-5、Gemini-2.5-Pro和DeepSeek-R1等领先的基于文本的闭源LLM，且使用的参数更少。

Conclusion: 多模态方法对于多孔材料理解至关重要，L2M3OF为下一代材料发现AI系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities
across diverse natural language tasks. However, comparable breakthroughs in
scientific discovery are more limited, because understanding complex physical
phenomena demands multifaceted representations far beyond language alone. A
compelling example is the design of functional materials such as MOFs-critical
for a range of impactful applications like carbon capture and hydrogen storage.
Navigating their vast and intricate design space in language-based
representations interpretable by LLMs is challenging due to the numerous
possible three-dimensional atomic arrangements and strict reticular rules of
coordination geometry and topology. Despite promising early results in
LLM-assisted discovery for simpler materials systems, MOF design remains
heavily reliant on tacit human expertise rarely codified in textual information
alone. To overcome this barrier, we introduce L2M3OF, the first multimodal LLM
for MOFs. L2M3OF integrates crystal representation learning with language
understanding to process structural, textual, and knowledge modalities jointly.
L2M3OF employs a pre-trained crystal encoder with a lightweight projection
layer to compress structural information into a token space, enabling efficient
alignment with language instructions. To facilitate training and evaluation, we
curate a structure-property-knowledge database of crystalline materials and
benchmark L2M3OF against state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs such as GPT-5,
Gemini-2.5-Pro and DeepSeek-R1. Experiments show that L2M3OF outperforms
leading text-based closed-source LLMs in property prediction and knowledge
generation tasks, despite using far fewer parameters. These results highlight
the importance of multimodal approaches for porous material understanding and
establish L2M3OF as a foundation for next-generation AI systems in materials
discovery.

Result: 在大量任务和架构上的广泛评估表明，MeDyate在极端内存约束下达到最先进性能，始终优于现有静态和动态方法，同时保持高计算效率，可在仅几百kB RAM的内存预算下有效微调。

Conclusion: MeDyate代表了向高效设备端学习迈出的重要一步，展示了在极低内存预算下的有效微调能力。

Abstract: On-device neural network training faces critical memory constraints that
limit the adaptation of pre-trained models to downstream tasks. We present
MeDyate, a theoretically-grounded framework for memory-constrained dynamic
subnetwork adaptation. Our approach introduces two key innovations: LaRa (Layer
Ranking), an improved layer importance metric that enables principled layer
pre-selection, and a dynamic channel sampling strategy that exploits the
temporal stability of channel importance distributions during fine-tuning.
MeDyate dynamically resamples channels between epochs according to
importance-weighted probabilities, ensuring comprehensive parameter space
exploration while respecting strict memory budgets. Extensive evaluation across
a large panel of tasks and architectures demonstrates that MeDyate achieves
state-of-the-art performance under extreme memory constraints, consistently
outperforming existing static and dynamic approaches while maintaining high
computational efficiency. Our method represents a significant step towards
enabling efficient on-device learning by demonstrating effective fine-tuning
with memory budgets as low as a few hundred kB of RAM.

Motivation: 大型语言模型推理需要大量计算资源和内存，标准均匀量化在低比特场景下会导致显著的性能下降，需要更有效的量化方法。

Method: 采用分组格向量量化框架，每组权重使用可学习的生成矩阵定义格码本，使用Babai舍入近似最近格点搜索来解决量化过程的不可微问题。

Conclusion: GLVQ框架提供了一种高效实用的量化流水线，解码过程简化为矩阵向量乘法，在保持精度的同时显著减少模型存储需求。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but
typically require extensive computational resources and memory for inference.
Post-training quantization (PTQ) can effectively reduce these demands by
storing weights in lower bit-width formats. However, standard uniform
quantization often leads to notable performance degradation, particularly in
low-bit scenarios. In this work, we introduce a Grouped Lattice Vector
Quantization (GLVQ) framework that assigns each group of weights a customized
lattice codebook, defined by a learnable generation matrix. To address the
non-differentiability of the quantization process, we adopt Babai rounding to
approximate nearest-lattice-point search during training, which enables stable
optimization of the generation matrices. Once trained, decoding reduces to a
simple matrix-vector multiplication, yielding an efficient and practical
quantization pipeline. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that our
approach achieves a better trade-off between model size and accuracy compared
to existing post-training quantization baselines, highlighting its
effectiveness in deploying large models under stringent resource constraints.

Abstract: In response to the increasingly critical demand for accurate prediction of
GPU memory resources in deep learning tasks, this paper deeply analyzes the
current research status and innovatively proposes a deep learning model that
integrates bidirectional gated recurrent units (BiGRU) to optimize the
Transformer architecture, aiming to improve the accuracy of memory demand
prediction. To verify the effectiveness of the model, a carefully designed
comparative experiment was conducted, selecting four representative basic
machine learning models: decision tree, random forest, Adaboost, and XGBoost as
benchmarks. The detailed experimental results show that the BiGRU Transformer
optimization model proposed in this paper exhibits significant advantages in
key evaluation indicators: in terms of mean square error (MSE) and root mean
square error (RMSE), the model achieves the lowest value among all comparison
models, and its predicted results have the smallest deviation from the actual
values; In terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of determination
(R2) indicators, the model also performs well and the results are balanced and
stable, with comprehensive predictive performance far exceeding the benchmark
machine learning methods compared. In summary, the Transformer model based on
bidirectional gated recurrent unit optimization successfully constructed in
this study can efficiently and accurately complete GPU memory demand prediction
tasks in deep learning tasks, and its prediction accuracy has been
significantly improved compared to traditional machine learning methods. This
research provides strong technical support and reliable theoretical basis for
optimizing resource scheduling and management of deep learning tasks, and
improving the utilization efficiency of computing clusters.

Abstract: Despite the non-convexity of most modern machine learning parameterizations,
Lagrangian duality has become a popular tool for addressing constrained

mitigate the duality gap in non-convex settings while requiring only minimal
modifications, and have remained comparably unexplored in constrained learning
settings. We establish strong duality results under mild conditions, prove
convergence of dual ascent algorithms to feasible and optimal primal solutions,
and provide PAC-style generalization guarantees. Finally, we demonstrate its
effectiveness on fairness constrained classification tasks.

Abstract: We present a general framework for training spiking neural networks (SNNs) to
perform binary classification on multivariate time series, with a focus on
step-wise prediction and high precision at low false alarm rates. The approach
uses the Evolutionary Optimization of Neuromorphic Systems (EONS) algorithm to
evolve sparse, stateful SNNs by jointly optimizing their architectures and
parameters. Inputs are encoded into spike trains, and predictions are made by
thresholding a single output neuron's spike counts. We also incorporate simple
voting ensemble methods to improve performance and robustness.
  To evaluate the framework, we apply it with application-specific
optimizations to the task of detecting low signal-to-noise ratio radioactive
sources in gamma-ray spectral data. The resulting SNNs, with as few as 49
neurons and 66 synapses, achieve a 51.8% true positive rate (TPR) at a false
alarm rate of 1/hr, outperforming PCA (42.7%) and deep learning (49.8%)
baselines. A three-model any-vote ensemble increases TPR to 67.1% at the same
false alarm rate. Hardware deployment on the microCaspian neuromorphic platform
demonstrates 2mW power consumption and 20.2ms inference latency.
  We also demonstrate generalizability by applying the same framework, without
domain-specific modification, to seizure detection in EEG recordings. An
ensemble achieves 95% TPR with a 16% false positive rate, comparable to recent
deep learning approaches with significant reduction in parameter count.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像自回归模型虽然性能优异，但采样步骤多导致生成速度慢。DD1方法虽然实现了少步采样，但在单步设置下性能下降明显，且依赖预定义映射限制了灵活性。

Result: 在ImageNet-256上，DD2实现单步采样，FID从3.40仅增加到5.43。相比DD1基线，将单步采样与原始AR模型的差距缩小67%，同时实现12.3倍训练加速。

Conclusion: DD2在实现单步AR生成方面迈出重要一步，为快速高质量的自回归建模开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Image Auto-regressive (AR) models have emerged as a powerful paradigm of
visual generative models. Despite their promising performance, they suffer from
slow generation speed due to the large number of sampling steps required.
Although Distilled Decoding 1 (DD1) was recently proposed to enable few-step
sampling for image AR models, it still incurs significant performance
degradation in the one-step setting, and relies on a pre-defined mapping that
limits its flexibility. In this work, we propose a new method, Distilled
Decoding 2 (DD2), to further advances the feasibility of one-step sampling for
image AR models. Unlike DD1, DD2 does not without rely on a pre-defined
mapping. We view the original AR model as a teacher model which provides the
ground truth conditional score in the latent embedding space at each token
position. Based on this, we propose a novel \emph{conditional score
distillation loss} to train a one-step generator. Specifically, we train a
separate network to predict the conditional score of the generated distribution
and apply score distillation at every token position conditioned on previous
tokens. Experimental results show that DD2 enables one-step sampling for image
AR models with an minimal FID increase from 3.40 to 5.43 on ImageNet-256.
Compared to the strongest baseline DD1, DD2 reduces the gap between the
one-step sampling and original AR model by 67%, with up to 12.3$\times$
training speed-up simultaneously. DD2 takes a significant step toward the goal
of one-step AR generation, opening up new possibilities for fast and
high-quality AR modeling. Code is available at

Abstract: Representation learning is increasingly applied to generate representations
that generalize well across multiple downstream tasks. Ensuring fairness
guarantees in representation learning is crucial to prevent unfairness toward
specific demographic groups in downstream tasks. In this work, we formally
introduce the task of learning representations that achieve high-confidence
fairness. We aim to guarantee that demographic disparity in every downstream
prediction remains bounded by a *user-defined* error threshold $\epsilon$, with
*controllable* high probability. To this end, we propose the ***F**air
**R**epresentation learning with high-confidence **G**uarantees (FRG)*
framework, which provides these high-confidence fairness guarantees by
leveraging an optimized adversarial model. We empirically evaluate FRG on three
real-world datasets, comparing its performance to six state-of-the-art fair
representation learning methods. Our results demonstrate that FRG consistently
bounds unfairness across a range of downstream models and tasks.

Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization has gained attention as a memory-efficient
alternative to first-order (FO) methods, particularly in settings where
gradient computation is expensive or even impractical. Beyond its memory
efficiency, in this work, we investigate ZO optimization for continual learning
(CL) as a novel approach to address the plasticity-stability-efficiency
trilemma. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evidence, we show that ZO
optimization naturally leads to flatter loss landscapes, which in turn reduce
forgetting in CL. However, this stability comes at a cost of plasticity: due to
its imprecise gradient estimates and slower convergence, ZO optimization tends
to be less effective than FO in acquiring new task-specific knowledge,
particularly under constrained training budgets. To better understand this
trade-off, we conduct a holistic evaluation of ZO optimization applied to
various existing CL methods. Our findings reveal that ZO optimization enhances
stability but often undermines plasticity, particularly when used with
learnable classifiers. Motivated by this insight, we propose ZO-FC, a simple
but effective approach that applies ZO optimization to a single adapter-based
PEFT module with FO optimized classifier. This design leverages the stability
benefits of ZO while preserving the adaptability of FO updates with negligible
memory overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ZO-FC achieves an effective
balance between stability and plasticity, offering a practical and
memory-efficient solution for on-device CL.

Abstract: To understand feature learning dynamics in neural networks, recent
theoretical works have focused on gradient-based learning of Gaussian
single-index models, where the label is a nonlinear function of a latent
one-dimensional projection of the input. While the sample complexity of online
SGD is determined by the information exponent of the link function, recent
works improved this by performing multiple gradient steps on the same sample
with different learning rates -- yielding a non-correlational update rule --
and instead are limited by the (potentially much smaller) generative exponent.
However, this picture is only valid when these learning rates are sufficiently
large. In this paper, we characterize the relationship between learning rate(s)
and sample complexity for a broad class of gradient-based algorithms that
encapsulates both correlational and non-correlational updates. We demonstrate
that, in certain cases, there is a phase transition from an "information
exponent regime" with small learning rate to a "generative exponent regime"
with large learning rate. Our framework covers prior analyses of one-pass SGD
and SGD with batch reuse, while also introducing a new layer-wise training
algorithm that leverages a two-timescales approach (via different learning
rates for each layer) to go beyond correlational queries without reusing
samples or modifying the loss from squared error. Our theoretical study
demonstrates that the choice of learning rate is as important as the design of
the algorithm in achieving statistical and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Labeling or classifying time series is a persistent challenge in the physical
sciences, where expert annotations are scarce, costly, and often inconsistent.
Yet robust labeling is essential to enable machine learning models for
understanding, prediction, and forecasting. We present the \textit{Clustering
and Indexation Pipeline with Human Evaluation for Recognition} (CIPHER), a
framework designed to accelerate large-scale labeling of complex time series in
physics. CIPHER integrates \textit{indexable Symbolic Aggregate approXimation}
(iSAX) for interpretable compression and indexing, density-based clustering
(HDBSCAN) to group recurring phenomena, and a human-in-the-loop step for
efficient expert validation. Representative samples are labeled by domain
scientists, and these annotations are propagated across clusters to yield
systematic, scalable classifications. We evaluate CIPHER on the task of
classifying solar wind phenomena in OMNI data, a central challenge in space
weather research, showing that the framework recovers meaningful phenomena such
as coronal mass ejections and stream interaction regions. Beyond this case
study, CIPHER highlights a general strategy for combining symbolic
representations, unsupervised learning, and expert knowledge to address label
scarcity in time series across the physical sciences. The code and
configuration files used in this study are publicly available to support

Abstract: Accurate long-term forecasting of spatiotemporal dynamics remains a
fundamental challenge across scientific and engineering domains. Existing
machine learning methods often neglect governing physical laws and fail to
quantify inherent uncertainties in spatiotemporal predictions. To address these
challenges, we introduce a physics-consistent neural operator (PCNO) that
enforces physical constraints by projecting surrogate model outputs onto
function spaces satisfying predefined laws. A physics-consistent projection
layer within PCNO efficiently computes mass and momentum conservation in
Fourier space. Building upon deterministic predictions, we further propose a
diffusion model-enhanced PCNO (DiffPCNO), which leverages a consistency model
to quantify and mitigate uncertainties, thereby improving the accuracy and
reliability of forecasts. PCNO and DiffPCNO achieve high-fidelity
spatiotemporal predictions while preserving physical consistency and
uncertainty across diverse systems and spatial resolutions, ranging from
turbulent flow modeling to real-world flood/atmospheric forecasting. Our
two-stage framework provides a robust and versatile approach for accurate,
physically grounded, and uncertainty-aware spatiotemporal forecasting.

Abstract: Non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are beginning to benefit from
large, public benchmarks. However, current benchmarks target relatively simple,
foundational tasks like Speech Detection and Phoneme Classification, while
application-ready results on tasks like Brain-to-Text remain elusive. We
propose Keyword Spotting (KWS) as a practically applicable, privacy-aware
intermediate task. Using the deep 52-hour, within-subject LibriBrain corpus, we
provide standardized train/validation/test splits for reproducible
benchmarking, and adopt an evaluation protocol tailored to extreme class
imbalance. Concretely, we use area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) as
a robust evaluation metric, complemented by false alarms per hour (FA/h) at
fixed recall to capture user-facing trade-offs. To simplify deployment and
further experimentation within the research community, we are releasing an
updated version of the pnpl library with word-level dataloaders and Colab-ready
tutorials. As an initial reference model, we present a compact 1-D Conv/ResNet
baseline with focal loss and top-k pooling that is trainable on a single
consumer-class GPU. The reference model achieves approximately 13x the
permutation baseline AUPRC on held-out sessions, demonstrating the viability of
the task. Exploratory analyses reveal: (i) predictable within-subject scaling -
performance improves log-linearly with more training hours - and (ii) the
existence of word-level factors (frequency and duration) that systematically
modulate detectability.

Conclusion: A-GPS是一个简单而强大的方法，能够高效生成高质量帕累托集近似，灵活捕捉用户偏好。

Abstract: We introduce active generation of Pareto sets (A-GPS), a new framework for
online discrete black-box multi-objective optimization (MOO). A-GPS learns a
generative model of the Pareto set that supports a-posteriori conditioning on
user preferences. The method employs a class probability estimator (CPE) to
predict non-dominance relations and to condition the generative model toward
high-performing regions of the search space. We also show that this
non-dominance CPE implicitly estimates the probability of hypervolume
improvement (PHVI). To incorporate subjective trade-offs, A-GPS introduces
preference direction vectors that encode user-specified preferences in
objective space. At each iteration, the model is updated using both Pareto
membership and alignment with these preference directions, producing an
amortized generative model capable of sampling across the Pareto front without
retraining. The result is a simple yet powerful approach that achieves
high-quality Pareto set approximations, avoids explicit hypervolume
computation, and flexibly captures user preferences. Empirical results on
synthetic benchmarks and protein design tasks demonstrate strong sample
efficiency and effective preference incorporation.

Abstract: We study the online multi-class selection problem with group fairness
guarantees, where limited resources must be allocated to sequentially arriving
agents. Our work addresses two key limitations in the existing literature.
First, we introduce a novel lossless rounding scheme that ensures the integral
algorithm achieves the same expected performance as any fractional solution.
Second, we explicitly address the challenges introduced by agents who belong to
multiple classes. To this end, we develop a randomized algorithm based on a
relax-and-round framework. The algorithm first computes a fractional solution
using a resource reservation approach -- referred to as the set-aside mechanism
-- to enforce fairness across classes. The subsequent rounding step preserves
these fairness guarantees without degrading performance. Additionally, we
propose a learning-augmented variant that incorporates untrusted
machine-learned predictions to better balance fairness and efficiency in
practical settings.

Abstract: Policy optimization (PO) is a cornerstone of modern reinforcement learning
(RL), with diverse applications spanning robotics, healthcare, and large
language model training. The increasing deployment of PO in sensitive domains,
however, raises significant privacy concerns. In this paper, we initiate a
theoretical study of differentially private policy optimization, focusing
explicitly on its sample complexity. We first formalize an appropriate
definition of differential privacy (DP) tailored to PO, addressing the inherent
challenges arising from on-policy learning dynamics and the subtlety involved
in defining the unit of privacy. We then systematically analyze the sample
complexity of widely-used PO algorithms, including policy gradient (PG),
natural policy gradient (NPG) and more, under DP constraints and various
settings, via a unified framework. Our theoretical results demonstrate that
privacy costs can often manifest as lower-order terms in the sample complexity,
while also highlighting subtle yet important observations in private PO
settings. These offer valuable practical insights for privacy-preserving PO
algorithms.

Abstract: We present a scalable machine learning framework for analyzing Parker Solar
Probe (PSP) solar wind data using distributed processing and the
quantum-inspired Kernel Density Matrices (KDM) method. The PSP dataset
(2018--2024) exceeds 150 GB, challenging conventional analysis approaches. Our
framework leverages Dask for large-scale statistical computations and KDM to
estimate univariate and bivariate distributions of key solar wind parameters,
including solar wind speed, proton density, and proton thermal speed, as well
as anomaly thresholds for each parameter. We reveal characteristic trends in
the inner heliosphere, including increasing solar wind speed with distance from
the Sun, decreasing proton density, and the inverse relationship between speed

mediating extreme space weather phenomena and can trigger geomagnetic storms;
our analyses provide quantitative insights into these processes. This approach

Abstract: Reasoning models represent a significant advance in LLM capabilities,
particularly for complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding.
Previous studies confirm that parallel test-time compute-sampling multiple
solutions and selecting the best one-can further enhance the predictive
performance of LLMs. However, strategies in this area often require complex
scoring, thus increasing computational cost and complexity. In this work, we
demonstrate that the simple and counterintuitive heuristic of selecting the
shortest solution is highly effective. We posit that the observed effectiveness
stems from models operating in two distinct regimes: a concise, confident
conventional regime and a verbose overthinking regime characterized by
uncertainty, and we show evidence of a critical point where the overthinking
regime begins to be significant. By selecting the shortest answer, the
heuristic preferentially samples from the conventional regime. We confirm that
this approach is competitive with more complex methods such as self-consistency
across two challenging benchmarks while significantly reducing computational
overhead. The shortest-answer heuristic provides a Pareto improvement over
self-consistency and applies even to tasks where output equality is not well
defined.

landscape of matrix-factorization-like problems by considering the last-layer
features as unconstrained free optimization variables and showing that their
global minima exhibit NC. In this paper, we show that gradient flow on a
two-layer ReLU network for classifying orthogonally separable data provably
exhibits NC, thereby advancing prior results in two ways: First, we relax the
assumption of unconstrained features, showing the effect of data structure and
nonlinear activations on NC characterizations. Second, we reveal the role of
the implicit bias of the training dynamics in facilitating the emergence of NC.

TL;DR: 提出了一种在移动设备上通过CPU-GPU协同执行来加速深度学习推理的方法，包括轻量级同步机制和基于机器学习的执行时间预测模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动设备计算资源有限，但其统一内存架构和CPU-GPU性能差距缩小为协同执行提供了机会，主要挑战是同步开销和执行时间预测困难。

Method: 使用OpenCL细粒度共享虚拟内存实现轻量级同步机制，并构建机器学习模型来准确预测CPU和GPU任务的执行时间，包括GPU内核的性能特征和调度时间。

Result: 在四个移动平台上评估显示，该方法能快速选择CPU-GPU协同执行策略，线性层加速比达1.89倍，卷积层达1.75倍，接近通过穷举搜索找到的最大可达到值。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了移动设备上CPU-GPU协同执行的同步和执行时间预测问题，显著提升了深度学习推理性能。

Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks on mobile devices is increasingly important
but remains challenging due to limited computing resources. On the other hand,
their unified memory architecture and narrower gap between CPU and GPU
performance provide an opportunity to reduce inference latency by assigning
tasks to both CPU and GPU. The main obstacles for such collaborative execution
are the significant synchronization overhead required to combine partial
results, and the difficulty of predicting execution times of tasks assigned to
CPU and GPU (due to the dynamic selection of implementations and parallelism
level). To overcome these obstacles, we propose both a lightweight
synchronization mechanism based on OpenCL fine-grained shared virtual memory
(SVM) and machine learning models to accurately predict execution times.
Notably, these models capture the performance characteristics of GPU kernels
and account for their dispatch times. A comprehensive evaluation on four mobile
platforms shows that our approach can quickly select CPU-GPU co-execution
strategies achieving up to 1.89x speedup for linear layers and 1.75x speedup
for convolutional layers (close to the achievable maximum values of 2.01x and
1.87x, respectively, found by exhaustive grid search on a Pixel~5 smartphone).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DictPFL是一个实用的联邦学习框架，通过分解模型权重为静态字典和可更新查找表，仅加密传输部分参数，在保证完全梯度保护的同时大幅降低计算和通信开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于同态加密的联邦学习方法存在两极化问题：要么加密所有梯度带来过高开销，要么部分加密存在隐私泄露风险。需要一种既能完全保护梯度隐私又具有实用性的解决方案。

Method: 提出两个关键模块：DePE将模型权重分解为静态字典和可更新查找表，仅加密后者；PrME通过加密感知剪枝和历史引导掩码最小化加密参数数量。

Result: 相比完全加密的联邦学习，通信成本降低402-748倍，训练速度提升28-65倍；相比选择性加密方法，开销降低51-155倍，速度提升4-19倍。运行时间仅比明文联邦学习慢2倍以内。

Conclusion: DictPFL首次证明基于同态加密的私有联邦学习在实际部署中是可行的，在保证完全隐私保护的同时实现了接近明文训练的性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
institutions without sharing raw data. However, gradient sharing still risks
privacy leakage, such as gradient inversion attacks. Homomorphic Encryption
(HE) can secure aggregation but often incurs prohibitive computational and
communication overhead. Existing HE-based FL methods sit at two extremes:
encrypting all gradients for full privacy at high cost, or partially encrypting
gradients to save resources while exposing vulnerabilities. We present DictPFL,
a practical framework that achieves full gradient protection with minimal
overhead. DictPFL encrypts every transmitted gradient while keeping
non-transmitted parameters local, preserving privacy without heavy computation.
It introduces two key modules: Decompose-for-Partial-Encrypt (DePE), which
decomposes model weights into a static dictionary and an updatable lookup
table, only the latter is encrypted and aggregated, while the static dictionary
remains local and requires neither sharing nor encryption; and
Prune-for-Minimum-Encrypt (PrME), which applies encryption-aware pruning to
minimize encrypted parameters via consistent, history-guided masks. Experiments
show that DictPFL reduces communication cost by 402-748$\times$ and accelerates
training by 28-65$\times$ compared to fully encrypted FL, while outperforming
state-of-the-art selective encryption methods by 51-155$\times$ in overhead and
4-19$\times$ in speed. Remarkably, DictPFL's runtime is within 2$\times$ of
plaintext FL, demonstrating for the first time, that HE-based private federated
learning is practical for real-world deployment. The code is publicly available
at https://github.com/UCF-ML-Research/DictPFL.

*Xiangyang Xu,Hongyang Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于基序驱动的全局-局部上下文图的少样本分子性质预测方法，通过引入化学基序节点构建三元异质图，在全局和局部层面丰富上下文信息，显著提升了少样本学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法依赖大量标注数据，而少样本分子性质预测面临数据稀缺问题。现有的分子-性质图结构指导有限，需要更丰富的上下文信息来提升预测性能。

Method: 构建全局三元异质图（基序-分子-性质）捕获长程组合模式，同时为每个节点构建局部子图进行编码，结合全局基序知识和细粒度局部上下文。

Result: 在五个标准FSMPP基准测试中，该方法持续优于最先进的方法，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: 整合全局基序知识与细粒度局部上下文能够显著提升少样本分子性质预测的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Molecular property prediction (MPP) is a cornerstone of drug discovery and
materials science, yet conventional deep learning approaches depend on large
labeled datasets that are often unavailable. Few-shot Molecular property
prediction (FSMPP) addresses this scarcity by incorporating relational
inductive bias through a context graph that links molecule nodes to property
nodes, but such molecule-property graphs offer limited structural guidance. We
propose a comprehensive solution: Motif Driven Global-Local Context Graph for
few-shot molecular property prediction, which enriches contextual information
at both the global and local levels. At the global level, chemically meaningful
motif nodes representing shared substructures, such as rings or functional
groups, are introduced to form a global tri-partite heterogeneous graph,
yielding motif-molecule-property connections that capture long-range
compositional patterns and enable knowledge transfer among molecules with
common motifs. At the local level, we build a subgraph for each node in the
molecule-property pair and encode them separately to concentrate the model's
attention on the most informative neighboring molecules and motifs. Experiments
on five standard FSMPP benchmarks demonstrate that our framework consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. These results underscore the
effectiveness of integrating global motif knowledge with fine-grained local
context to advance robust few-shot molecular property prediction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ESCORT是一个基于粒子的框架，用于在高维信念空间中捕捉复杂多模态分布，通过相关感知投影和时间一致性约束改进SVGD方法，在信念近似精度和决策质量上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着环境变得更加真实，信念分布变得复杂，标准数学模型无法准确捕捉，现有POMDP信念近似方法无法准确表示复杂的不确定性结构（如高维多模态信念分布），导致估计错误和次优的智能体行为。

Method: ESCORT扩展了SVGD，引入两个关键创新：相关感知投影（建模状态维度间的依赖关系）和时间一致性约束（在保持相关结构的同时稳定更新）。该方法保留了SVGD的吸引-排斥粒子动力学，同时能够准确建模复杂的相关模式。

Result: 在POMDP领域和不同维度的合成多模态分布上进行广泛评估，ESCORT在信念近似精度和下游决策质量方面始终优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: ESCORT能够动态适应信念景观的复杂性，无需重采样或限制性分布假设，为高维复杂信念分布提供了有效的表示方法。

Abstract: In Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), maintaining and
updating belief distributions over possible underlying states provides a
principled way to summarize action-observation history for effective
decision-making under uncertainty. As environments grow more realistic, belief
distributions develop complexity that standard mathematical models cannot
accurately capture, creating a fundamental challenge in maintaining
representational accuracy. Despite advances in deep learning and probabilistic
modeling, existing POMDP belief approximation methods fail to accurately
represent complex uncertainty structures such as high-dimensional, multi-modal
belief distributions, resulting in estimation errors that lead to suboptimal
agent behaviors. To address this challenge, we present ESCORT (Efficient
Stein-variational and sliced Consistency-Optimized Representation for Temporal
beliefs), a particle-based framework for capturing complex, multi-modal
distributions in high-dimensional belief spaces. ESCORT extends SVGD with two
key innovations: correlation-aware projections that model dependencies between
state dimensions, and temporal consistency constraints that stabilize updates
while preserving correlation structures. This approach retains SVGD's
attractive-repulsive particle dynamics while enabling accurate modeling of
intricate correlation patterns. Unlike particle filters prone to degeneracy or
parametric methods with fixed representational capacity, ESCORT dynamically
adapts to belief landscape complexity without resampling or restrictive
distributional assumptions. We demonstrate ESCORT's effectiveness through
extensive evaluations on both POMDP domains and synthetic multi-modal
distributions of varying dimensionality, where it consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of belief approximation accuracy and
downstream decision quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在特征收集成本高昂的设定下（如添加调查问题或物理传感器），需要选择有限特征，使得基于这些特征训练的模型能在多个子群体上同时表现良好。

Method: 将问题构建为传统变量选择的连续松弛，使用加噪机制，无需通过模型训练过程进行反向传播。通过优化贝叶斯最优预测器的方差，开发模型无关的框架。

Result: 在合成数据集和真实世界数据上的实验验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够平衡不同群体下游预测性能，在特征收集成本高的场景下具有实用价值。

Abstract: We study the problem of selecting limited features to observe such that
models trained on them can perform well simultaneously across multiple
subpopulations. This problem has applications in settings where collecting each
feature is costly, e.g. requiring adding survey questions or physical sensors,
and we must be able to use the selected features to create high-quality
downstream models for different populations. Our method frames the problem as a
continuous relaxation of traditional variable selection using a noising
mechanism, without requiring backpropagation through model training processes.
By optimizing over the variance of a Bayes-optimal predictor, we develop a
model-agnostic framework that balances overall performance of downstream
prediction across populations. We validate our approach through experiments on
both synthetic datasets and real-world data.

TL;DR: SolarBoost提出了一种分布式光伏系统功率输出预测的新方法，通过将聚合功率输出建模为小电网输出的组合，解决了DPV系统面临的电网数据缺失、容量时变、地理变异性等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有集中式光伏方法难以应用于分布式光伏系统，因为DPV面临电网级数据缺失、安装容量时变、地理变异性、面板多样性等独特挑战。

Method: 将聚合功率输出建模为小电网输出的组合，每个电网输出使用单位输出函数乘以其容量来建模，将同质单位输出函数与动态容量解耦以实现准确预测。

Result: 通过理论分析和实验验证了电网级建模的优越性，在中国多个城市部署验证，显著减少了潜在损失，为电网运营提供了宝贵见解。

Conclusion: SolarBoost通过创新的电网级建模方法有效解决了分布式光伏系统功率预测的挑战，在实际部署中表现出色。

Abstract: This paper presents SolarBoost, a novel approach for forecasting power output
in distributed photovoltaic (DPV) systems. While existing centralized
photovoltaic (CPV) methods are able to precisely model output dependencies due
to uniformity, it is difficult to apply such techniques to DPV systems, as DPVs
face challenges such as missing grid-level data, temporal shifts in installed
capacity, geographic variability, and panel diversity. SolarBoost overcomes
these challenges by modeling aggregated power output as a composite of output
from small grids, where each grid output is modeled using a unit output
function multiplied by its capacity. This approach decouples the homogeneous
unit output function from dynamic capacity for accurate prediction. Efficient
algorithms over an upper-bound approximation are proposed to overcome
computational bottlenecks in loss functions. We demonstrate the superiority of
grid-level modeling via theoretical analysis and experiments. SolarBoost has
been validated through deployment across various cities in China, significantly
reducing potential losses and provides valuable insights for the operation of
power grids. The code for this work is available at

Motivation: 医疗物联网要求严格的端到端延迟保证，而调度这些顺序工作流以最小化完成时间是一个NP难问题。

Method: 采用分层决策过程：全局控制器执行层选择（边缘、雾或云），专门的本地控制器处理选定层内的节点分配。

Result: 实验结果表明，随着工作流复杂度的增加，该框架相比基线方法表现出越来越优越的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架能够学习有效的长期策略，这对于复杂、大规模的医疗物联网调度场景至关重要。

Abstract: The Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) demands stringent end-to-end latency
guarantees for sequential healthcare workflows deployed over heterogeneous
cloud-fog-edge infrastructures. Scheduling these sequential workflows to
minimize makespan is an NP-hard problem. To tackle this challenge, we propose a
Two-tier DDPG-based scheduling framework that decomposes the scheduling
decision into a hierarchical process: a global controller performs layer
selection (edge, fog, or cloud), while specialized local controllers handle
node assignment within the chosen layer. The primary optimization objective is
the minimization of the workflow makespan. Experiments results validate our
approach, demonstrating increasingly superior performance over baselines as
workflow complexity rises. This trend highlights the frameworks ability to
learn effective long-term strategies, which is critical for complex,
large-scale MIoT scheduling scenarios.

Method: 利用具有预测不确定性估计的代理模型来动态塑造奖励函数，促进多个优化目标之间的平衡。

Result: 在三个基准数据集和多个扩散模型架构上全面评估，在分子质量和属性优化方面持续优于基线方法。分子动力学模拟和ADMET分析显示生成的候选分子具有有前景的类药行为和结合稳定性，与已知EGFR抑制剂相当。

Conclusion: 强化学习引导的生成扩散模型在推进自动化分子设计方面具有强大潜力。

Abstract: Designing de novo 3D molecules with desirable properties remains a
fundamental challenge in drug discovery and molecular engineering. While
diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality 3D molecular structures, they often struggle to effectively
control complex multi-objective constraints critical for real-world
applications. In this study, we propose an uncertainty-aware Reinforcement
Learning (RL) framework to guide the optimization of 3D molecular diffusion
models toward multiple property objectives while enhancing the overall quality
of the generated molecules. Our method leverages surrogate models with
predictive uncertainty estimation to dynamically shape reward functions,
facilitating balance across multiple optimization objectives. We
comprehensively evaluate our framework across three benchmark datasets and
multiple diffusion model architectures, consistently outperforming baselines
for molecular quality and property optimization. Additionally, Molecular
Dynamics (MD) simulations and ADMET profiling of top generated candidates
indicate promising drug-like behavior and binding stability, comparable to
known Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) inhibitors. Our results
demonstrate the strong potential of RL-guided generative diffusion models for
advancing automated molecular design.

TL;DR: RePULSe是一种新的训练方法，通过在学习过程中主动采样低奖励输出来减少不良输出的概率，同时保持平均奖励性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准强化学习方法优化平均奖励，但减少不良输出概率的方法通常会牺牲平均性能。需要改进这种权衡关系。

Method: 在标准RL损失基础上增加额外损失，使用学习到的提议来指导采样低奖励输出，然后降低这些输出的概率。

Result: 实验表明RePULSe在期望奖励与不良输出概率之间提供了更好的权衡，并且具有更强的对抗鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RePULSe方法比标准RL对齐方法和替代方案在权衡性能和鲁棒性方面表现更好。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a predominant technique to align
language models (LMs) with human preferences or promote outputs which are
deemed to be desirable by a given reward function. Standard RL approaches
optimize average reward, while methods explicitly focused on reducing the
probability of undesired outputs typically come at a cost to average-case
performance. To improve this tradeoff, we introduce RePULSe, a new training
method that augments the standard RL loss with an additional loss that uses
learned proposals to guide sampling low-reward outputs, and then reduces those
outputs' probability. We run experiments demonstrating that RePULSe produces a
better tradeoff of expected reward versus the probability of undesired outputs
and is more adversarially robust, compared to standard RL alignment approaches
and alternatives.

Conclusion: 该框架为聚类分析提供了统一的数学基础，能够同时处理经典聚类和鲁棒聚类问题，具有良好的理论保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: This paper presents a unified matrix factorization framework for classical
and robust clustering. We begin by revisiting the well-known equivalence
between crisp k-means clustering and matrix factorization, following and
rigorously rederiving an unpublished formulation by Bauckhage. Extending this
framework, we derive an analogous matrix factorization interpretation for fuzzy
c-means clustering, which to the best of our knowledge has not been previously
formalized. These reformulations allow both clustering paradigms to be
expressed as optimization problems over factor matrices, thereby enabling
principled extensions to robust variants. To address sensitivity to outliers,
we propose robust formulations for both crisp and fuzzy clustering by replacing
the Frobenius norm with the l1,2-norm, which penalizes the sum of Euclidean
norms across residual columns. We develop alternating minimization algorithms
for the standard formulations and IRLS-based algorithms for the robust
counterparts. All algorithms are theoretically proven to converge to a local
minimum.

Abstract: The Meteorology is a field where huge amounts of data are generated, mainly
collected by sensors at weather stations, where different variables can be
measured. Those data have some particularities such as high volume and
dimensionality, the frequent existence of missing values in some stations, and
the high correlation between collected variables. In this regard, it is crucial
to make use of Big Data and Data Mining techniques to deal with those data and
extract useful knowledge from them that can be used, for instance, to predict
weather phenomena. In this paper, we propose a visual big data system that is
designed to deal with high amounts of weather-related data and lets the user
analyze those data to perform predictive tasks over the considered variables
(temperature and rainfall). The proposed system collects open data and loads
them onto a local NoSQL database fusing them at different levels of temporal
and spatial aggregation in order to perform a predictive analysis using
univariate and multivariate approaches as well as forecasting based on training
data from neighbor stations in cases with high rates of missing values. The
system has been assessed in terms of usability and predictive performance,
obtaining an overall normalized mean squared error value of 0.00013, and an
overall directional symmetry value of nearly 0.84. Our system has been rated
positively by a group of experts in the area (all aspects of the system except
graphic desing were rated 3 or above in a 1-5 scale). The promising preliminary
results obtained demonstrate the validity of our system and invite us to keep
working on this area.

Abstract: We study a bilevel \emph{max-max} optimization framework for principal-agent
contract design, in which a principal chooses incentives to maximize utility
while anticipating the agent's best response. This problem, central to moral
hazard and contract theory, underlies applications ranging from market design
to delegated portfolio management, hedge fund fee structures, and executive
compensation. While linear-quadratic models such as Holmstr"om-Milgrom admit
closed-form solutions, realistic environments with nonlinear utilities,
stochastic dynamics, or high-dimensional actions generally do not.
  We introduce a generic algorithmic framework that removes this reliance on
closed forms. Our method adapts modern machine learning techniques for bilevel
optimization -- using implicit differentiation with conjugate gradients (CG) --
to compute hypergradients efficiently through Hessian-vector products, without
ever forming or inverting Hessians. In benchmark CARA-Normal (Constant Absolute
Risk Aversion with Gaussian distribution of uncertainty) environments, the
approach recovers known analytical optima and converges reliably from random
initialization. More broadly, because it is matrix-free, variance-reduced, and
problem-agnostic, the framework extends naturally to complex nonlinear
contracts where closed-form solutions are unavailable, such as sigmoidal wage
schedules (logistic pay), relative-performance/tournament compensation with
common shocks, multi-task contracts with vector actions and heterogeneous
noise, and CARA-Poisson count models with $\mathbb{E}[X\mid a]=e^{a}$. This
provides a new computational tool for contract design, enabling systematic
study of models that have remained analytically intractable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练大语言模型在特定任务微调时会记忆敏感数据，存在隐私泄露风险，需要一种无需重新训练的安全净化方法。

Method: 采用擦除阶段重置模型最后层神经元以破坏记忆，然后通过修复阶段进行微调避免重新记忆敏感信息。

Result: 仅需少量额外训练轮次即可显著减少模型对敏感信息的泄露，有效净化模型。

Conclusion: SANI为医院等行业提供了一种经济高效的模型净化方案，可在共享模型前有效保护敏感数据隐私。

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are becoming useful for various
tasks. To improve their performance on certain tasks, it is necessary to
fine-tune them on specific data corpora (e.g., medical reports, business data).
These specialized data corpora may contain sensitive data (e.g., personal or
confidential data) that will be memorized by the model and likely to be
regurgitated during its subsequent use. This memorization of sensitive
information by the model poses a significant privacy or confidentiality issue.
To remove this memorization and sanitize the model without requiring costly
additional fine-tuning on a secured data corpus, we propose SANI. SANI is an
unlearning approach to sanitize language models. It relies on both an erasure
and repair phases that 1) reset certain neurons in the last layers of the model
to disrupt the memorization of fine-grained information, and then 2) fine-tune
the model while avoiding memorizing sensitive information. We comprehensively
evaluate SANI to sanitize both a model fine-tuned and specialized with medical
data by removing directly and indirectly identifiers from the memorization of
the model, and a standard pre-trained model by removing specific terms defined
as confidential information from the model. Results show that with only few
additional epochs of unlearning, the model is sanitized and the number of
regurgitations is drastically reduced. This approach can be particularly useful
for hospitals or other industries that have already spent significant resources
training models on large datasets and wish to sanitize them before sharing.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) requires models to continuously adapt to new tasks

a perturbation-based strategy that minimizes conflicts with previously learned

identifies and assigns basis vectors with minimal sensitivity to interference,
reducing the risk of degrading past knowledge while maintaining efficient
adaptation to new tasks. Empirical results on standard CL benchmarks
demonstrate that PLAN consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a
new state-of-the-art for continual learning with foundation models.

*Zihao Fu,Ryan Brown,Shun Shao,Kai Rawal,Eoin Delaney,Chris Russell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairImagen是一个后处理去偏框架，通过操作提示嵌入来减轻文本到图像扩散模型中的社会偏见，无需重新训练或修改底层模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion）经常复制和放大社会偏见，特别是在性别和种族等人口统计属性方面。

Method: 使用公平主成分分析将CLIP输入嵌入投影到最小化群体特定信息的子空间，结合经验噪声注入和跨人口统计投影方法实现多属性同时去偏。

Result: 在性别、种族和交叉设置上的广泛实验表明，FairImagen显著提高了公平性，在图像质量和提示保真度方面有适度权衡。

Conclusion: 该框架优于现有的后处理方法，为公平的文本到图像生成提供了简单、可扩展且模型无关的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality and diverse images from
natural language prompts. However, recent studies reveal that these models
often replicate and amplify societal biases, particularly along demographic
attributes like gender and race. In this paper, we introduce FairImagen
(https://github.com/fuzihaofzh/FairImagen), a post-hoc debiasing framework that
operates on prompt embeddings to mitigate such biases without retraining or
modifying the underlying diffusion model. Our method integrates Fair Principal
Component Analysis to project CLIP-based input embeddings into a subspace that
minimizes group-specific information while preserving semantic content. We
further enhance debiasing effectiveness through empirical noise injection and
propose a unified cross-demographic projection method that enables simultaneous
debiasing across multiple demographic attributes. Extensive experiments across
gender, race, and intersectional settings demonstrate that FairImagen
significantly improves fairness with a moderate trade-off in image quality and
prompt fidelity. Our framework outperforms existing post-hoc methods and offers
a simple, scalable, and model-agnostic solution for equitable text-to-image
generation.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了GenReview数据集，这是迄今为止最大的包含LLM生成评审意见的数据集，涵盖ICLR 2018-2025年所有论文提交，使用三种不同提示生成评审意见，用于研究LLM在科学同行评审中的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在科学同行评审中的潜在应用日益增多，需要全面数据集来理解LLM在评审中的效用和影响，此前缺乏这样的数据集。

Method: 创建GenReview数据集，包含81K条LLM生成的评审意见，为ICLR 2018-2025年所有论文提交使用负面、正面和中性三种独立提示生成评审，并与原始论文和评审相关联。

Result: 研究发现LLM在评审中存在偏见，LLM生成的评审目前可被自动检测，LLM并不总能严格遵循评审指南，且LLM提供的评分仅与论文接受决定一致。

Conclusion: GenReview数据集为研究LLM在科学同行评审中的影响提供了宝贵资源，揭示了LLM在评审过程中的局限性和潜在问题。

Abstract: How does the progressive embracement of Large Language Models (LLMs) affect
scientific peer reviewing? This multifaceted question is fundamental to the
effectiveness -- as well as to the integrity -- of the scientific process.
Recent evidence suggests that LLMs may have already been tacitly used in peer
reviewing, e.g., at the 2024 International Conference of Learning
Representations (ICLR). Furthermore, some efforts have been undertaken in an
attempt to explicitly integrate LLMs in peer reviewing by various editorial
boards (including that of ICLR'25). To fully understand the utility and the
implications of LLMs' deployment for scientific reviewing, a comprehensive
relevant dataset is strongly desirable. Despite some previous research on this
topic, such dataset has been lacking so far. We fill in this gap by presenting
GenReview, the hitherto largest dataset containing LLM-written reviews. Our
dataset includes 81K reviews generated for all submissions to the 2018--2025
editions of the ICLR by providing the LLM with three independent prompts: a
negative, a positive, and a neutral one. GenReview is also linked to the
respective papers and their original reviews, thereby enabling a broad range of
investigations. To illustrate the value of GenReview, we explore a sample of
intriguing research questions, namely: if LLMs exhibit bias in reviewing (they
do); if LLM-written reviews can be automatically detected (so far, they can);
if LLMs can rigorously follow reviewing instructions (not always) and whether
LLM-provided ratings align with decisions on paper acceptance or rejection
(holds true only for accepted papers). GenReview can be accessed at the
following link: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/gen_review.

*JunRu Luo,Difei Cheng,Bo Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于二阶统计量的AUC优化新方法，通过构建二阶代理损失函数解决了传统AUC优化的非凸性和内存瓶颈问题，实现了更优的遗憾界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AUC是分类任务中重要的性能指标，但在类别不平衡场景下，由于成对0/1损失的非凸性和不连续性，以及实例存储的高内存成本，使得AUC优化面临重大挑战。

Method: 提出基于成对铰链损失的二阶代理损失，通过训练数据的一阶和二阶统计量直接替代整个聚合的成对损失，并开发了高效的在线算法和核化扩展。

Result: 理论分析表明，新方法实现了O(ln T)的遗憾界，优于传统方法的O(√T)；在多个基准数据集上的实验验证了该方法的优越效率和效果。

Conclusion: 提出的二阶代理损失为在线AUC优化提供了一种高效有效的新范式，解决了传统方法的优化困难和内存瓶颈问题。

Abstract: The Area Under the Curve (AUC) is an important performance metric for
classification tasks, particularly in class-imbalanced scenarios. However,
minimizing the AUC presents significant challenges due to the non-convex and
discontinuous nature of pairwise 0/1 losses, which are difficult to optimize,
as well as the substantial memory cost of instance-wise storage, which creates
bottlenecks in large-scale applications. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a novel second-order surrogate loss based on the pairwise hinge loss,
and develop an efficient online algorithm. Unlike conventional approaches that
approximate each individual pairwise 0/1 loss term with an instance-wise
surrogate function, our approach introduces a new paradigm that directly
substitutes the entire aggregated pairwise loss with a surrogate loss function
constructed from the first- and second-order statistics of the training data.
Theoretically, while existing online AUC optimization algorithms typically
achieve an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound, our method attains a tighter
$\mathcal{O}(\ln T)$ bound. Furthermore, we extend the proposed framework to
nonlinear settings through a kernel-based formulation. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior efficiency and
effectiveness of the proposed second-order surrogate loss in optimizing online
AUC performance.

Motivation: 表格基础模型(TFMs)通过纯合成数据集预训练表现出色，但指导先验设计的原则仍不明确，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 系统研究合成先验的关键特性，基于这些洞察提出Mitra模型，使用精心挑选的多样化合成先验分布进行训练。

Result: Mitra在分类和回归基准测试中一致优于TabPFNv2和TabICL等最先进TFMs，具有更好的样本效率。

Conclusion: 合成先验的多样性、独特性和性能是TFMs泛化能力的关键，Mitra的成功验证了系统先验设计的有效性。

Abstract: Since the seminal work of TabPFN, research on tabular foundation models
(TFMs) based on in-context learning (ICL) has challenged long-standing
paradigms in machine learning. Without seeing any real-world data, models
pretrained on purely synthetic datasets generalize remarkably well across
diverse datasets, often using only a moderate number of in-context examples.
This shifts the focus in tabular machine learning from model architecture
design to the design of synthetic datasets, or, more precisely, to the prior
distributions that generate them. Yet the guiding principles for prior design
remain poorly understood. This work marks the first attempt to address the gap.
We systematically investigate and identify key properties of synthetic priors
that allow pretrained TFMs to generalize well. Based on these insights, we
introduce Mitra, a TFM trained on a curated mixture of synthetic priors
selected for their diversity, distinctiveness, and performance on real-world
tabular data. Mitra consistently outperforms state-of-the-art TFMs, such as
TabPFNv2 and TabICL, across both classification and regression benchmarks, with
better sample efficiency.

Motivation: 图神经网络面临固定消息传递架构难以适应现实世界图结构多样性的挑战，现有图MoE方法依赖监督信号且训练不稳定

Method: 采用骨干-残差专家架构，基础编码器提供稳定性，专用残差专家捕获多样化计算模式，结构感知门控网络进行细粒度节点路由，通过统一无监督目标端到端训练

Result: 在16个基准测试中验证了ADaMoRE在无监督节点分类和少样本学习方面的最先进性能，具有更好的泛化能力、训练效率和收敛速度

Conclusion: ADaMoRE框架通过无监督训练实现了异构MoE在图上的鲁棒训练，显著提升了图神经网络的适应性和性能

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) face a fundamental adaptability challenge: their
fixed message-passing architectures struggle with the immense diversity of
real-world graphs, where optimal computational strategies vary by local
structure and task. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) offers a promising pathway
to adaptability, existing graph MoE methods remain constrained by their
reliance on supervised signals and instability when training heterogeneous
experts. We introduce ADaMoRE (Adaptive Mixture of Residual Experts), a
principled framework that enables robust, fully unsupervised training of
heterogeneous MoE on graphs. ADaMoRE employs a backbone-residual expert
architecture where foundational encoders provide stability while specialized
residual experts capture diverse computational patterns. A structurally-aware
gating network performs fine-grained node routing. The entire architecture is
trained end-to-end using a unified unsupervised objective, which integrates a
primary reconstruction task with an information-theoretic diversity regularizer
to explicitly enforce functional specialization among the experts. Theoretical
analysis confirms our design improves data efficiency and training stability.
Extensive evaluation across 16 benchmarks validates ADaMoRE's state-of-the-art
performance in unsupervised node classification and few-shot learning,
alongside superior generalization, training efficiency, and faster convergence
on diverse graphs and tasks.

Motivation: 解决传统流匹配生成模型中间生成步骤缺乏可解释性的问题，使生成过程具有物理意义。

Conclusion: 将物理语义嵌入生成流可以将不透明的神经轨迹转化为可解释的物理过程。

Abstract: Generative models based on flow matching have demonstrated remarkable success
in various domains, yet they suffer from a fundamental limitation: the lack of
interpretability in their intermediate generation steps. In fact these models
learn to transform noise into data through a series of vector field updates,
however the meaning of each step remains opaque. We address this problem by
proposing a general framework constraining each flow step to be sampled from a
known physical distribution. Flow trajectories are mapped to (and constrained
to traverse) the equilibrium states of the simulated physical process. We
implement this approach through the 2D Ising model in such a way that flow
steps become thermal equilibrium points along a parametric cooling schedule.
  Our proposed architecture includes an encoder that maps discrete Ising
configurations into a continuous latent space, a flow-matching network that
performs temperature-driven diffusion, and a projector that returns to discrete
Ising states while preserving physical constraints.
  We validate this framework across multiple lattice sizes, showing that it
preserves physical fidelity while outperforming Monte Carlo generation in speed
as the lattice size increases. In contrast with standard flow matching, each
vector field represents a meaningful stepwise transition in the 2D Ising
model's latent space. This demonstrates that embedding physical semantics into
generative flows transforms opaque neural trajectories into interpretable
physical processes.

Motivation: 现有模型合并方法在参数空间操作，受到参数不一致性的限制，需要更灵活和鲁棒的合并方法。

Result: 综合实验证明FDAs在模型合并中的有效性，且与参数空间模型合并方法互补。

Conclusion: FDA框架通过建模输入表示空间，为模型合并提供了新的视角，兼具鲁棒性和灵活性。

Abstract: Model merging is an efficient post-training strategy for integrating
knowledge from multiple finetuned checkpoints of a shared foundation model.
Existing methods operate in the parameter space, combining task vectors to
mitigate conflicts, but remain constrained by parameter inconsistencies. We
propose Functional Dual Anchors (FDAs), a framework that instead models the
input-representation space. FDAs are synthetic inputs whose induced gradients
align with task vectors, capturing task-specific functional shifts relative to
the pretrained model. This perspective bridges joint multi-task training and
post-hoc merging, offering both robustness and flexibility. We further
introduce a principled initialization scheme and show that FDAs are
complementary to parameter-space model merging. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of FDAs in model merging.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CoD的反事实解释增强蒸馏方法，用于解决少样本任务感知知识蒸馏中的数据稀缺问题。该方法通过注入反事实解释来精确映射教师模型的决策边界，在仅需少量样本的情况下显著提升学生模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的任务感知蒸馏方法通常需要大量数据，但在许多实际场景中这些数据可能无法获取或成本高昂。本文旨在解决少样本场景下的知识蒸馏挑战。

Method: CoD方法系统性地注入反事实解释（CFEs）——即能够以最小扰动翻转教师模型预测输出的输入。通过利用CFEs来精确映射教师模型的决策边界，显著减少所需样本数量。

Result: 在各种数据集和LLM上的实验表明，CoD在少样本场景（低至8-512个样本）中优于标准蒸馏方法。CoD仅使用基线方法一半的原始样本及其对应的CFEs，仍能提升性能。

Conclusion: CoD为少样本任务感知知识蒸馏提供了一种有效的解决方案，通过反事实解释显著减少了数据需求，同时保持了模型性能。该方法从统计和几何角度为CFEs在蒸馏中的作用提供了理论保证。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a promising approach to transfer capabilities from
complex teacher models to smaller, resource-efficient student models that can
be deployed easily, particularly in task-aware scenarios. However, existing
methods of task-aware distillation typically require substantial quantities of
data which may be unavailable or expensive to obtain in many practical
scenarios. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a novel
strategy called Counterfactual-explanation-infused Distillation CoD for
few-shot task-aware knowledge distillation by systematically infusing
counterfactual explanations. Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) refer to inputs
that can flip the output prediction of the teacher model with minimum
perturbation. Our strategy CoD leverages these CFEs to precisely map the
teacher's decision boundary with significantly fewer samples. We provide
theoretical guarantees for motivating the role of CFEs in distillation, from
both statistical and geometric perspectives. We mathematically show that CFEs
can improve parameter estimation by providing more informative examples near
the teacher's decision boundary. We also derive geometric insights on how CFEs
effectively act as knowledge probes, helping the students mimic the teacher's
decision boundaries more effectively than standard data. We perform experiments
across various datasets and LLMs to show that CoD outperforms standard
distillation approaches in few-shot regimes (as low as 8-512 samples). Notably,
CoD only uses half of the original samples used by the baselines, paired with
their corresponding CFEs and still improves performance.

Conclusion: 通过对抗训练构建最混淆实例的方法揭示了模型不确定性与探索需求之间的关系，为深度模型强化学习提供了新的理论见解。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL) theory, the concept of most confusing
instances is central to establishing regret lower bounds, that is, the minimal
exploration needed to solve a problem. Given a reference model and its optimal
policy, a most confusing instance is the statistically closest alternative
model that makes a suboptimal policy optimal. While this concept is
well-studied in multi-armed bandits and ergodic tabular Markov decision
processes, constructing such instances remains an open question in the general
case. In this paper, we formalize this problem for neural network world models
as a constrained optimization: finding a modified model that is statistically
close to the reference one, while producing divergent performance between
optimal and suboptimal policies. We propose an adversarial training procedure
to solve this problem and conduct an empirical study across world models of
varying quality. Our results suggest that the degree of achievable confusion
correlates with uncertainty in the approximate model, which may inform
theoretically-grounded exploration strategies for deep model-based RL.

of stochastic gradient descent in continuous time, in the lazy training regime.
We show that, under regularity conditions on the Hessian of the loss function,
SGLD with multiplicative and state-dependent noise (i) yields a non-degenerate
kernel throughout the training process with high probability, and (ii) achieves
exponential convergence to the empirical risk minimizer in expectation, and we
establish finite-time and finite-width bounds on the optimality gap. We
corroborate our theoretical findings with numerical examples in the regression
setting.

Abstract: Recent advances in Scientific Machine Learning have shown that second-order
methods can enhance the training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs),
making them a suitable alternative to traditional numerical methods for Partial
Differential Equations (PDEs). However, second-order methods induce large
memory requirements, making them scale poorly with the model size. In this
paper, we define a local Mixture of Experts (MoE) combining the
parameter-efficiency of ensemble models and sparse coding to enable the use of
second-order training. Our model -- \textsc{PINN Balls} -- also features a
fully learnable domain decomposition structure, achieved through the use of
Adversarial Adaptive Sampling (AAS), which adapts the DD to the PDE and its
domain. \textsc{PINN Balls} achieves better accuracy than the state-of-the-art
in scientific machine learning, while maintaining invaluable scalability
properties and drawing from a sound theoretical background.

Conclusion: Wideformer通过并行聚合和引导机制成功解决了图注意力中的过度聚合问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Graph attention has demonstrated superior performance in graph learning
tasks. However, learning from global interactions can be challenging due to the
large number of nodes. In this paper, we discover a new phenomenon termed
over-aggregating. Over-aggregating arises when a large volume of messages is
aggregated into a single node with less discrimination, leading to the dilution
of the key messages and potential information loss. To address this, we propose
Wideformer, a plug-and-play method for graph attention. Wideformer divides the
aggregation of all nodes into parallel processes and guides the model to focus
on specific subsets of these processes. The division can limit the input volume
per aggregation, avoiding message dilution and reducing information loss. The
guiding step sorts and weights the aggregation outputs, prioritizing the
informative messages. Evaluations show that Wideformer can effectively mitigate
over-aggregating. As a result, the backbone methods can focus on the
informative messages, achieving superior performance compared to baseline
methods.

Conclusion: Buffer层方法有效解决了归一化层更新的根本限制，在真实世界域自适应场景中展现出有效性和通用性。

Abstract: In recent advancements in Test Time Adaptation (TTA), most existing
methodologies focus on updating normalization layers to adapt to the test
domain. However, the reliance on normalization-based adaptation presents key
challenges. First, normalization layers such as Batch Normalization (BN) are
highly sensitive to small batch sizes, leading to unstable and inaccurate
statistics. Moreover, normalization-based adaptation is inherently constrained
by the structure of the pre-trained model, as it relies on training-time
statistics that may not generalize well to unseen domains. These issues limit
the effectiveness of normalization-based TTA approaches, especially under
significant domain shift. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm based on
the concept of a Buffer layer, which addresses the fundamental limitations of
normalization layer updates. Unlike existing methods that modify the core
parameters of the model, our approach preserves the integrity of the
pre-trained backbone, inherently mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting
during online adaptation. Through comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate
that our approach not only outperforms traditional methods in mitigating domain
shift and enhancing model robustness, but also exhibits strong resilience to
forgetting. Furthermore, our Buffer layer is modular and can be seamlessly
integrated into nearly all existing TTA frameworks, resulting in consistent
performance improvements across various architectures. These findings validate
the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed solution in real-world domain
adaptation scenarios. The code is available at

Conclusion: 测试匹配的数据增强与基于变换器的集成策略是在噪声条件下实现鲁棒人类活动识别的有效方法。

Abstract: We present a noise-aware, sensor-specific ensemble approach for robust human
activity recognition on the 2nd WEAR Dataset Challenge. Our method leverages
the PatchTST transformer architecture, training four independent models-one per
inertial sensor location-on a tampered training set whose 1-second sliding
windows are augmented to mimic the test-time noise. By aligning the train and
test data schemas (JSON-encoded 50-sample windows) and applying randomized
jitter, scaling, rotation, and channel dropout, each PatchTST model learns to
generalize across real-world sensor perturbations. At inference, we compute
softmax probabilities from all four sensor models on the Kaggle test set and
average them to produce final labels. On the private leaderboard, this pipeline
achieves a macro-F1 substantially above the baseline, demonstrating that
test-matched augmentation combined with transformer-based ensembling is an
effective strategy for robust HAR under noisy conditions.

Abstract: Data selection is one of the fundamental problems in neural network training,
particularly for multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) where identifying the most
valuable training samples from massive, multi-source, and heterogeneous data
sources under budget constraints poses significant challenges. Existing data
selection methods, including coreset construction, data Shapley values, and
influence functions, suffer from critical limitations: they oversimplify
nonlinear transformations, ignore informative intermediate representations in
hidden layers, or fail to scale to larger MLPs due to high computational
complexity. In response, we propose DVC (Data Value Contribution), a novel
budget-aware method for evaluating and selecting data for MLP training that
accounts for the dynamic evolution of network parameters during training. The
DVC method decomposes data contribution into Layer Value Contribution (LVC) and
Global Value Contribution (GVC), employing six carefully designed metrics and
corresponding efficient algorithms to capture data characteristics across three
dimensions--quality, relevance, and distributional diversity--at different
granularities. DVC integrates these assessments with an Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) algorithm for adaptive source selection that balances exploration and
exploitation. Extensive experiments across six datasets and eight baselines
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches under
various budget constraints, achieving superior accuracy and F1 scores. Our
approach represents the first systematic treatment of hierarchical data
evaluation for neural networks, providing both theoretical guarantees and
practical advantages for large-scale machine learning systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文分析了广义可加模型(GAMs)解释生成的复杂性，发现在不同输入空间结构、组件模型类型、回归与分类任务以及不同解释方法下，计算复杂度存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战GAMs解释生成必然高效的传统假设，系统分析不同条件下解释GAMs的计算复杂性。

Method: 基于P!=NP等标准复杂性假设，分析不同形式GAMs在各种上下文中的解释生成计算复杂度。

Result: 发现解释GAMs的复杂性高度依赖输入空间结构；组件模型差异仅在特定输入域下显现；回归与分类任务的解释复杂度显著不同；某些情况下将复杂模型表达为可加形式可简化解释。

Conclusion: 为GAMs解释计算的可行性提供了严谨的理论框架，揭示了在何种条件下这些计算是可能或必然困难的。

Abstract: Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) are commonly considered *interpretable*
within the ML community, as their structure makes the relationship between
inputs and outputs relatively understandable. Therefore, it may seem natural to
hypothesize that obtaining meaningful explanations for GAMs could be performed
efficiently and would not be computationally infeasible. In this work, we
challenge this hypothesis by analyzing the *computational complexity* of
generating different explanations for various forms of GAMs across multiple
contexts. Our analysis reveals a surprisingly diverse landscape of both
positive and negative complexity outcomes. Particularly, under standard
complexity assumptions such as P!=NP, we establish several key findings: (1) in
stark contrast to many other common ML models, the complexity of generating
explanations for GAMs is heavily influenced by the structure of the input
space; (2) the complexity of explaining GAMs varies significantly with the
types of component models used - but interestingly, these differences only
emerge under specific input domain settings; (3) significant complexity
distinctions appear for obtaining explanations in regression tasks versus
classification tasks in GAMs; and (4) expressing complex models like neural
networks additively (e.g., as neural additive models) can make them easier to
explain, though interestingly, this benefit appears only for certain
explanation methods and input domains. Collectively, these results shed light
on the feasibility of computing diverse explanations for GAMs, offering a
rigorous theoretical picture of the conditions under which such computations
are possible or provably hard.

TL;DR: EPHAD是一个测试时适应框架，用于在训练数据被污染的情况下更新异常检测模型的输出，通过整合预训练模型和传统异常检测方法的证据来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的异常检测数据集通常包含未检测到或错误标记的异常，导致传统方法性能下降。现有解决方案需要访问训练流程、数据或异常比例的先验知识，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出EPHAD框架，在测试时更新在污染数据集上训练的异常检测模型的输出。整合了预训练多模态基础模型（如CLIP）、传统异常检测方法（如潜在异常因子）或领域特定知识的证据。

Result: 在8个视觉异常检测数据集、26个表格异常检测数据集和1个真实工业数据集上验证了有效性。消融研究表明对超参数变化和不同污染水平具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: EPHAD展示了在不同异常检测模型和证据对中的多功能性和鲁棒性，为解决训练数据污染问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) methods typically assume clean training
data, yet real-world datasets often contain undetected or mislabeled anomalies,
leading to significant performance degradation. Existing solutions require
access to the training pipelines, data or prior knowledge of the proportions of
anomalies in the data, limiting their real-world applicability. To address this
challenge, we propose EPHAD, a simple yet effective test-time adaptation
framework that updates the outputs of AD models trained on contaminated
datasets using evidence gathered at test time. Our approach integrates the
prior knowledge captured by the AD model trained on contaminated datasets with
evidence derived from multimodal foundation models like Contrastive
Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), classical AD methods like the Latent
Outlier Factor or domain-specific knowledge. We illustrate the intuition behind
EPHAD using a synthetic toy example and validate its effectiveness through
comprehensive experiments across eight visual AD datasets, twenty-six tabular
AD datasets, and a real-world industrial AD dataset. Additionally, we conduct
an ablation study to analyse hyperparameter influence and robustness to varying
contamination levels, demonstrating the versatility and robustness of EPHAD
across diverse AD models and evidence pairs. To ensure reproducibility, our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/sukanyapatra1997/EPHAD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据通常存在噪声和歧义，部分标签学习(PLL)旨在处理每个实例与多个候选标签相关联的情况，但现有方法要么计算密集，要么依赖启发式标签细化。

Method: 使用摊销变分推断，通过神经网络从输入数据预测变分参数来直接近似真实标签的后验分布，实现高效推理且架构无关。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在准确性和效率方面都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将深度学习的表达能力与概率建模的严谨性相结合，为部分标签学习提供了一种高效且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world data is frequently noisy and ambiguous. In crowdsourcing, for
example, human annotators may assign conflicting class labels to the same
instances. Partial-label learning (PLL) addresses this challenge by training
classifiers when each instance is associated with a set of candidate labels,
only one of which is correct. While early PLL methods approximate the true
label posterior, they are often computationally intensive. Recent deep learning
approaches improve scalability but rely on surrogate losses and heuristic label
refinement. We introduce a novel probabilistic framework that directly
approximates the posterior distribution over true labels using amortized
variational inference. Our method employs neural networks to predict
variational parameters from input data, enabling efficient inference. This
approach combines the expressiveness of deep learning with the rigor of
probabilistic modeling, while remaining architecture-agnostic. Theoretical
analysis and extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
accuracy and efficiency.

Result: 发现相邻数据集在类别分布重叠更大时表现出更低的模型多样性，这一反直觉现象源于共享的Rashomon参数。提出了新的多重性感知数据获取策略和插补技术。

Conclusion: 数据分布特性对模型多样性有重要影响，传统预期可能不成立。提出的多重性感知方法在主动学习和数据插补中具有实用价值。

Abstract: Multiplicity -- the existence of distinct models with comparable performance
-- has received growing attention in recent years. While prior work has largely
emphasized modelling choices, the critical role of data in shaping multiplicity
has been comparatively overlooked. In this work, we introduce a neighbouring
datasets framework to examine the most granular case: the impact of a
single-data-point difference on multiplicity. Our analysis yields a seemingly
counterintuitive finding: neighbouring datasets with greater inter-class
distribution overlap exhibit lower multiplicity. This reversal of conventional
expectations arises from a shared Rashomon parameter, and we substantiate it
with rigorous proofs.
  Building on this foundation, we extend our framework to two practical
domains: active learning and data imputation. For each, we establish natural
extensions of the neighbouring datasets perspective, conduct the first
systematic study of multiplicity in existing algorithms, and finally, propose
novel multiplicity-aware methods, namely, multiplicity-aware data acquisition
strategies for active learning and multiplicity-aware data imputation
techniques.

Motivation: 传统随机多臂老虎机中的遗憾度量未能解决奖励分配的公平性问题，特别是在临床实验等需要公平分配奖励的场景中。现有最小化Nash遗憾的方法需要专门算法设计和强假设，限制了适用性。

Result: 该算法实现了近乎最优的Nash遗憾，并在所有p值上统一证明了（近乎）最优的遗憾界，相比先前工作在更弱假设下取得更好性能。

Conclusion: 简单算法（均匀探索+UCB）可有效最小化Nash遗憾和更广泛的p-均值遗憾，仅需弱假设，为公平多臂老虎机问题提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Regret in stochastic multi-armed bandits traditionally measures the
difference between the highest reward and either the arithmetic mean of
accumulated rewards or the final reward. These conventional metrics often fail
to address fairness among agents receiving rewards, particularly in settings
where rewards are distributed across a population, such as patients in clinical
trials. To address this, a recent body of work has introduced Nash regret,
which evaluates performance via the geometric mean of accumulated rewards,
aligning with the Nash social welfare function known for satisfying fairness
axioms.
  To minimize Nash regret, existing approaches require specialized algorithm
designs and strong assumptions, such as multiplicative concentration
inequalities and bounded, non-negative rewards, making them unsuitable for even
Gaussian reward distributions. We demonstrate that an initial uniform
exploration phase followed by a standard Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm
achieves near-optimal Nash regret, while relying only on additive Hoeffding
bounds, and naturally extending to sub-Gaussian rewards. Furthermore, we
generalize the algorithm to a broad class of fairness metrics called the
$p$-mean regret, proving (nearly) optimal regret bounds uniformly across all
$p$ values. This is in contrast to prior work, which made extremely restrictive
assumptions on the bandit instances and even then achieved suboptimal regret
bounds.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个分析自适应优化器在浮点量化下的收敛性理论框架，揭示了Adam和Muon在低精度训练中的收敛特性，填补了经验成功与理论理解之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的快速扩展使得低精度训练对于减少内存、提高效率以及支持更大模型和数据集变得至关重要。然而，现有的自适应优化器收敛理论假设所有组件都是精确的，忽略了硬件感知的量化问题，因此无法解释为什么低精度训练仍然有效。

Method: 引入了首个分析自适应优化器在梯度、权重和优化器状态（如动量估计）浮点量化下收敛性的理论框架。在该框架下，推导了在标准随机梯度假设下平滑非凸目标上的收敛率，明确描述了不同组件的量化误差如何影响收敛。

Result: 分析表明，只要尾数长度与迭代次数呈对数关系，两种算法都能保持接近全精度对应算法的收敛率。进一步揭示Adam对权重和第二动量量化高度敏感，而Muon需要更弱的误差控制，因此可能更鲁棒。数值实验验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 该研究为低精度训练方法的理论理解提供了重要进展，缩小了经验成功与理论理解之间的差距，为实际应用中的量化策略选择提供了理论指导。

Abstract: The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has made low-precision
training essential for reducing memory, improving efficiency, and enabling
larger models and datasets. Existing convergence theories for adaptive
optimizers, however, assume all components are exact and neglect hardware-aware
quantization, leaving open the question of why low-precision training remains
effective. We introduce the first theoretical framework for analyzing the
convergence of adaptive optimizers, including Adam and Muon, under
floating-point quantization of gradients, weights, and optimizer states (e.g.,
moment estimates). Within this framework, we derive convergence rates on smooth
non-convex objectives under standard stochastic gradient assumptions,
explicitly characterizing how quantization errors from different components
affect convergence. We show that both algorithms retain rates close to their
full-precision counterparts provided mantissa length scales only
logarithmically with the number of iterations. Our analysis further reveals
that Adam is highly sensitive to weights and second-moment quantization due to
its reliance on $\beta_2 \to 1$, while Muon requires weaker error control and
is thus potentially more robust. These results narrow the gap between empirical
success and theoretical understanding of low-precision training methods.
Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world data corroborate our theory.

Result: ScoreNF在小型训练集上仍保持高性能，在合成2D分布和高维ϕ⁴晶格场理论分布上验证了有效性

Conclusion: ScoreNF提供了一种高效采样未归一化分布的方法，减少了对计算昂贵的MCMC训练数据的依赖

Abstract: Unnormalized probability distributions are central to modeling complex
physical systems across various scientific domains. Traditional sampling
methods, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), often suffer from slow
convergence, critical slowing down, poor mode mixing, and high autocorrelation.
In contrast, likelihood-based and adversarial machine learning models, though
effective, are heavily data-driven, requiring large datasets and often
encountering mode covering and mode collapse. In this work, we propose ScoreNF,
a score-based learning framework built on the Normalizing Flow (NF)
architecture, integrated with an Independent Metropolis-Hastings (IMH) module,
enabling efficient and unbiased sampling from unnormalized target
distributions. We show that ScoreNF maintains high performance even with small
training ensembles, thereby reducing reliance on computationally expensive
MCMC-generated training data. We also present a method for assessing
mode-covering and mode-collapse behaviours. We validate our method on synthetic
2D distributions (MOG-4 and MOG-8) and the high-dimensional $\phi^4$ lattice
field theory distribution, demonstrating its effectiveness for sampling tasks.

Conclusion: RAVEN有效解决了弱到强泛化在分布偏移下的挑战，为复杂模型的监督提供了鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: As future superhuman models become increasingly complex, accurately
supervising their behavior may exceed human capabilities. Recent works have
demonstrated that in such scenarios, weak models can effectively supervise
strong models, a phenomenon known as weak-to-strong generalization. However, we
find that naive weak-to-strong generalization fails under distribution shifts,
often leading to worse performance of the strong model than its weak
supervisors. To address this, we propose RAVEN, a robust weak-to-strong
generalization framework that dynamically learns the optimal combinations of
weak models in addition to parameters of the strong model. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of RAVEN on image classification, text classification, and
preference alignment tasks. RAVEN outperforms alternative baselines by over 30%
on out-of-distribution tasks while matching or surpassing existing methods on
in-distribution tasks. Moreover, our results show that RAVEN assigns higher
weights to more accurate weak models, demonstrating its ability to
automatically identify trustworthy supervision.

Abstract: Fine-tuning has proven to be highly effective in adapting pre-trained models
to perform better on new desired tasks with minimal data samples. Among the
most widely used approaches are reparameterization methods, which update a
target module by augmenting its frozen weight matrix with an additional
trainable weight matrix. The most prominent example is Low Rank Adaption
(LoRA), which gained significant attention in recent years. In this paper, we
introduce a new class of reparameterization methods for transfer learning,
designed to enhance the generalization ability of fine-tuned models. We
establish the effectiveness of our approach in a high-dimensional binary
classification setting using tools from Random Matrix Theory, and further
validate our theoretical findings through more realistic experiments, such as
fine-tuning LLMs.

Abstract: Robust yield curve estimation is crucial in fixed-income markets for accurate
instrument pricing, effective risk management, and informed trading strategies.
Traditional approaches, including the bootstrapping method and parametric
Nelson-Siegel models, often struggle with overfitting or instability issues,
especially when underlying bonds are sparse, bond prices are volatile, or
contain hard-to-remove noise. In this paper, we propose a neural networkbased
framework for robust yield curve estimation tailored to small mortgage bond
markets. Our model estimates the yield curve independently for each day and
introduces a new loss function to enforce smoothness and stability, addressing
challenges associated with limited and noisy data. Empirical results on Swedish
mortgage bonds demonstrate that our approach delivers more robust and stable
yield curve estimates compared to existing methods such as
Nelson-Siegel-Svensson (NSS) and Kernel-Ridge (KR). Furthermore, the framework
allows for the integration of domain-specific constraints, such as alignment
with risk-free benchmarks, enabling practitioners to balance the trade-off
between smoothness and accuracy according to their needs.

Conclusion: C-MCTD通过组合式方法显著提升了规划能力，解决了MCTD的局限性，为长序列推理任务提供了更强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) integrates diffusion models with structured
tree search to enable effective trajectory exploration through stepwise
reasoning. However, MCTD remains fundamentally limited by training trajectory
lengths. While periodic replanning allows plan concatenation for longer plan
generation, the planning process remains locally confined, as MCTD searches
within individual trajectories without access to global context. We propose
Compositional Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (C-MCTD), a framework that elevates
planning from individual trajectory optimization to reasoning over complete
plan compositions. C-MCTD introduces three complementary components: (1) Online
Composer, which performs globally-aware planning by searching across entire
plan compositions; (2) Distributed Composer, which reduces search complexity
through parallel exploration from multiple starting points; and (3) Preplan
Composer, which accelerates inference by leveraging cached plan graphs.

Abstract: Class incremental learning (CIL) requires an agent to learn distinct tasks
consecutively with knowledge retention against forgetting. Problems impeding
the practical applications of CIL methods are twofold: (1) non-i.i.d batch
streams and no boundary prompts to update, known as the harsher online
task-free CIL (OTCIL) scenario; (2) CIL methods suffer from memory loss in
learning long task streams, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). To achieve efficient
decision-making and decrease cumulative regrets during the OTCIL process, a
randomized neural network (Randomized NN) with forward regularization (-F) is
proposed to resist forgetting and enhance learning performance. This general
framework integrates unsupervised knowledge into recursive convex optimization,
has no learning dissipation, and can outperform the canonical ridge style (-R)
in OTCIL. Based on this framework, we derive the algorithm of the ensemble deep
random vector functional link network (edRVFL) with adjustable forward
regularization (-kF), where k mediates the intensity of the intervention.
edRVFL-kF generates one-pass closed-form incremental updates and variable
learning rates, effectively avoiding past replay and catastrophic forgetting
while achieving superior performance. Moreover, to curb unstable penalties
caused by non-i.i.d and mitigate intractable tuning of -kF in OTCIL, we improve
it to the plug-and-play edRVFL-kF-Bayes, enabling all hard ks in multiple
sub-learners to be self-adaptively determined based on Bayesian learning.
Experiments were conducted on 2 image datasets including 6 metrics, dynamic
performance, ablation tests, and compatibility, which distinctly validates the
efficacy of our OTCIL frameworks with -kF-Bayes and -kF styles.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of \emph{cost-sensitive} hyperparameter
optimization (HPO) built upon freeze-thaw Bayesian optimization (BO).
Specifically, we assume a scenario where users want to early-stop the HPO
process when the expected performance improvement is not satisfactory with
respect to the additional computational cost. Motivated by this scenario, we
introduce \emph{utility} in the freeze-thaw framework, a function describing
the trade-off between the cost and performance that can be estimated from the
user's preference data. This utility function, combined with our novel
acquisition function and stopping criterion, allows us to dynamically continue
training the configuration that we expect to maximally improve the utility in
the future, and also automatically stop the HPO process around the maximum
utility. Further, we improve the sample efficiency of existing freeze-thaw
methods with transfer learning to develop a specialized surrogate model for the
cost-sensitive HPO problem. We validate our algorithm on established
multi-fidelity HPO benchmarks and show that it outperforms all the previous
freeze-thaw BO and transfer-BO baselines we consider, while achieving a
significantly better trade-off between the cost and performance. Our code is

Motivation: 现有解耦表示学习方法依赖特定于因子的策略，当遇到新的变化因素或多个因素共存时，需要重新设计架构或目标函数，造成显著开销。

Method: 引入组合性偏置作为模块化归纳偏置，通过因子特定的混合策略随机重混潜在变量，并使用先验损失和组合一致性损失来发现因子结构。

Result: 在属性和对象解耦方面表现出竞争力，并独特地实现了全局风格和对象的联合解耦。

Conclusion: 该方法通过简单地调整混合策略即可实现不同类型因子的解耦，为解耦表示学习提供了灵活通用的框架。

Abstract: Recent disentangled representation learning (DRL) methods heavily rely on
factor specific strategies-either learning objectives for attributes or model
architectures for objects-to embed inductive biases. Such divergent approaches
result in significant overhead when novel factors of variation do not align
with prior assumptions, such as statistical independence or spatial
exclusivity, or when multiple factors coexist, as practitioners must redesign
architectures or objectives. To address this, we propose a compositional bias,
a modular inductive bias decoupled from both objectives and architectures. Our
key insight is that different factors obey distinct recombination rules in the
data distribution: global attributes are mutually exclusive, e.g., a face has
one nose, while objects share a common support (any subset of objects can
co-exist). We therefore randomly remix latents according to factor-specific
rules, i.e., a mixing strategy, and force the encoder to discover whichever
factor structure the mixing strategy reflects through two complementary
objectives: (i) a prior loss that ensures every remix decodes into a realistic
image, and (ii) the compositional consistency loss introduced by Wiedemer et
al. (arXiv:2310.05327), which aligns each composite image with its
corresponding composite latent. Under this general framework, simply adjusting
the mixing strategy enables disentanglement of attributes, objects, and even
both, without modifying the objectives or architectures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method shows competitive performance in both attribute and
object disentanglement, and uniquely achieves joint disentanglement of global
style and objects. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本研究通过用户实验证明，在睡眠医学中，透明AI辅助（特别是作为质量控制步骤应用时）能显著提高专家评分性能，减少评分者间差异，并获得临床医生的高度接受。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统在生物医学信号解释中已能达到或超越人类专家水平，但临床实践中需要解决何时以及为何信任算法推荐的问题，以实现有效的临床整合。

Method: 对8名专业睡眠医学从业者进行应用基础的用户研究，在三种条件下评分夜间觉醒事件：手动评分、黑盒AI辅助和透明白盒AI辅助，辅助时机分为开始评分时或作为事后质量控制。

Result: AI和人类-AI团队在临床标准下均显著优于无辅助专家，透明AI辅助作为质量控制步骤时比黑盒辅助提高约30%的事件级性能，质量控制时机进一步改善计数结果。透明性和质量控制方法虽增加评分时间，但开始时的辅助更快且更受参与者偏好。

Conclusion: 策略性定时的透明AI辅助能有效平衡准确性和临床效率，为临床工作流程中可信AI整合和用户接受提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly match or surpass human
experts in biomedical signal interpretation. However, their effective
integration into clinical practice requires more than high predictive accuracy.
Clinicians must discern \textit{when} and \textit{why} to trust algorithmic
recommendations. This work presents an application-grounded user study with
eight professional sleep medicine practitioners, who score nocturnal arousal
events in polysomnographic data under three conditions: (i) manual scoring,
(ii) black-box (BB) AI assistance, and (iii) transparent white-box (WB) AI
assistance. Assistance is provided either from the \textit{start} of scoring or
as a post-hoc quality-control (\textit{QC}) review. We systematically evaluate
how the type and timing of assistance influence event-level and clinically most
relevant count-based performance, time requirements, and user experience. When
evaluated against the clinical standard used to train the AI, both AI and
human-AI teams significantly outperform unaided experts, with collaboration
also reducing inter-rater variability. Notably, transparent AI assistance
applied as a targeted QC step yields median event-level performance
improvements of approximately 30\% over black-box assistance, and QC timing
further enhances count-based outcomes. While WB and QC approaches increase the
time required for scoring, start-time assistance is faster and preferred by
most participants. Participants overwhelmingly favor transparency, with seven
out of eight expressing willingness to adopt the system with minor or no
modifications. In summary, strategically timed transparent AI assistance
effectively balances accuracy and clinical efficiency, providing a promising
pathway toward trustworthy AI integration and user acceptance in clinical
workflows.

TL;DR: 使用大语言模型研究关联学习中的表征变化，发现中等相似项目在学习后出现分化，这种分化受词汇干扰（新关联与先验知识竞争）调节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 关联学习是人类认知的基础，但测试生物系统中表征变化假设具有挑战性。大语言模型提供了可扩展的替代方案来研究这种表征动态。

Method: 基于大语言模型的上下文学习能力，改编认知神经科学关联学习范式，在六个模型中调查表征如何演化，并利用模型可控性研究词汇干扰的影响。

Result: 发现非单调塑性模式，中等相似项目在学习后分化；词汇干扰越高，分化越明显，表明表征变化受项目相似性和全局竞争共同影响。

Conclusion: 大语言模型不仅是研究类人学习系统表征动态的强大工具，也是生成关于大脑记忆重组原理新假设的可访问通用计算模型。

Abstract: Associative learning--forming links between co-occurring items--is
fundamental to human cognition, reshaping internal representations in complex
ways. Testing hypotheses on how representational changes occur in biological
systems is challenging, but large language models (LLMs) offer a scalable
alternative. Building on LLMs' in-context learning, we adapt a cognitive
neuroscience associative learning paradigm and investigate how representations
evolve across six models. Our initial findings reveal a non-monotonic pattern
consistent with the Non-Monotonic Plasticity Hypothesis, with moderately
similar items differentiating after learning. Leveraging the controllability of
LLMs, we further show that this differentiation is modulated by the overlap of
associated items with the broader vocabulary--a factor we term vocabulary
interference, capturing how new associations compete with prior knowledge. We
find that higher vocabulary interference amplifies differentiation, suggesting
that representational change is influenced by both item similarity and global
competition. Our findings position LLMs not only as powerful tools for studying
representational dynamics in human-like learning systems, but also as
accessible and general computational models for generating new hypotheses about
the principles underlying memory reorganization in the brain.

Motivation: 传统扩散方法依赖预训练模型学习逆过程，而自扩散旨在开发自包含的迭代过程，不依赖外部模型或预训练分数函数

Method: 自扩散框架：交替执行加噪和去噪步骤，使用随机初始化的单卷积网络作为自去噪器，通过数据保真度损失持续训练

Result: 在线性逆问题上表现出色，达到或优于其他方法的性能

Conclusion: 自扩散提供了一种灵活通用的逆问题解决方法，不依赖预训练模型，适应任意前向算子和噪声观测

Abstract: We propose self-diffusion, a novel framework for solving inverse problems
without relying on pretrained generative models. Traditional diffusion-based
approaches require training a model on a clean dataset to learn to reverse the
forward noising process. This model is then used to sample clean solutions --
corresponding to posterior sampling from a Bayesian perspective -- that are
consistent with the observed data under a specific task. In contrast,
self-diffusion introduces a self-contained iterative process that alternates
between noising and denoising steps to progressively refine its estimate of the
solution. At each step of self-diffusion, noise is added to the current
estimate, and a self-denoiser, which is a single untrained convolutional
network randomly initialized from scratch, is continuously trained for certain
iterations via a data fidelity loss to predict the solution from the noisy
estimate. Essentially, self-diffusion exploits the spectral bias of neural
networks and modulates it through a scheduled noise process. Without relying on
pretrained score functions or external denoisers, this approach still remains
adaptive to arbitrary forward operators and noisy observations, making it
highly flexible and broadly applicable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on a variety of linear inverse problems, showing that self-diffusion
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to other methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于物理信息的极限学习机（PIELM）框架，用于解决逆Stefan问题，相比传统PINNs方法在精度和训练效率上都有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统物理信息神经网络（PINNs）在解决Stefan问题时存在超参数依赖性强、训练效率低和预测精度不足的问题，需要开发更高效准确的方法。

Method: 使用极限学习机网络替代传统深度神经网络，固定输入权重，通过最小二乘法优化由初始边界条件和控制偏微分方程组成的物理定律损失向量来确定输出权重，将逆Stefan问题转化为寻找Moore-Penrose广义逆的问题。

Result: 案例研究表明，PIELM相比传统PINNs方法，相对L2误差提高了3-7个数量级的预测精度，同时节省了超过94%的训练时间。

Conclusion: PIELM框架为逆Stefan问题提供了一种快速、准确的物理信息学习方法，在精度和效率方面都显著优于传统PINNs方法。

Abstract: The inverse Stefan problem, as a typical phase-change problem with moving
boundaries, finds extensive applications in science and engineering. Recent
years have seen the applications of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to
solving Stefan problems, yet they still exhibit shortcomings in hyperparameter
dependency, training efficiency, and prediction accuracy. To address this, this
paper develops a physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM), a rapid
physics-informed learning method framework for inverse Stefan problems. PIELM
replaces conventional deep neural networks with an extreme learning machine
network. The input weights are fixed in the PIELM framework, and the output
weights are determined by optimizing a loss vector of physical laws composed by
initial and boundary conditions and governing partial differential equations
(PDEs). Then, solving inverse Stefan problems is transformed into finding the
Moore-Penrose generalized inverse by the least squares method. Case studies
show that the PIELM can increase the prediction accuracy by 3-7 order of
magnitude in terms of the relative L2 error, and meanwhile saving more than 94%
training time, compared to conventional PINNs.

Motivation: 解决大规模网络系统（如交通、电力、无线网络）中强化学习面临的规模和环境变化挑战。

Method: 每个智能体学习稀疏局部因果掩码识别影响其动态的最小邻域变量，获得紧凑状态和领域因子表示；元演员-评论家在多个源域上训练共享策略，并在测试时通过少量轨迹估计新领域因子来部署适应策略。

Result: GSAC能够快速适应新领域，显著优于从头学习和传统适应基线方法。

Conclusion: GSAC通过因果表示学习和元学习相结合，为大规模网络系统提供了可扩展且具有领域泛化能力的强化学习解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale networked systems, such as traffic, power, and wireless grids,
challenge reinforcement-learning agents with both scale and environment shifts.
To address these challenges, we propose GSAC (Generalizable and Scalable
Actor-Critic), a framework that couples causal representation learning with
meta actor-critic learning to achieve both scalability and domain
generalization. Each agent first learns a sparse local causal mask that
provably identifies the minimal neighborhood variables influencing its
dynamics, yielding exponentially tight approximately compact representations
(ACRs) of state and domain factors. These ACRs bound the error of truncating
value functions to $\kappa$-hop neighborhoods, enabling efficient learning on
graphs. A meta actor-critic then trains a shared policy across multiple source
domains while conditioning on the compact domain factors; at test time, a few
trajectories suffice to estimate the new domain factor and deploy the adapted
policy. We establish finite-sample guarantees on causal recovery, actor-critic
convergence, and adaptation gap, and show that GSAC adapts rapidly and
significantly outperforms learning-from-scratch and conventional adaptation
baselines.

TL;DR: 提出统一令牌表示(UTR)，将回报目标、状态和动作合并为单个令牌，显著减少序列长度和模型复杂度，提高离线强化学习的计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如Decision Transformer存在冗余令牌化和二次注意力复杂度问题，限制了在实时或资源受限环境中的可扩展性。

Method: 开发UTR表示法，并基于transformer和门控CNN构建UDT和UDC两个变体。

Result: 两种变体在显著降低计算量的同时，达到或超越了最先进方法的性能。

Conclusion: UTR在不同架构上泛化良好，可能为未来大规模决策模型提供高效基础。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated strong potential in offline reinforcement
learning (RL) by modeling trajectories as sequences of return-to-go, states,
and actions. However, existing approaches such as the Decision Transformer(DT)
and its variants suffer from redundant tokenization and quadratic attention
complexity, limiting their scalability in real-time or resource-constrained
settings. To address this, we propose a Unified Token Representation (UTR) that
merges return-to-go, state, and action into a single token, substantially
reducing sequence length and model complexity. Theoretical analysis shows that
UTR leads to a tighter Rademacher complexity bound, suggesting improved
generalization. We further develop two variants: UDT and UDC, built upon
transformer and gated CNN backbones, respectively. Both achieve comparable or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods with markedly lower
computation. These findings demonstrate that UTR generalizes well across
architectures and may provide an efficient foundation for scalable control in
future large decision models.

TL;DR: ParaRNN是一个突破非线性RNN序列并行化障碍的框架，通过牛顿迭代和并行归约实现高达665倍的加速，成功训练了70亿参数的LSTM和GRU模型，性能与同等规模的Transformer和Mamba2相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RNN的序列性限制了并行计算能力，而现有的并行架构如Transformers和状态空间模型虽然能并行化，但线性约束限制了其表达能力，无法建模复杂的非线性序列依赖关系。

Method: 将非线性递归关系序列转化为单个方程组，使用牛顿迭代结合自定义并行归约算法进行并行求解，实现了非线性RNN的高效并行训练。

Result: 实现了高达665倍的加速比，成功训练了70亿参数的LSTM和GRU模型，在困惑度指标上与同等规模的Transformer和Mamba2架构相当。

Conclusion: ParaRNN突破了非线性RNN的并行化障碍，为高效序列建模开辟了新方向，通过开源框架促进了非线性RNN模型的大规模探索。

Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) laid the foundation for sequence modeling,
but their intrinsic sequential nature restricts parallel computation, creating
a fundamental barrier to scaling. This has led to the dominance of
parallelizable architectures like Transformers and, more recently, State Space
Models (SSMs). While SSMs achieve efficient parallelization through structured
linear recurrences, this linearity constraint limits their expressive power and
precludes modeling complex, nonlinear sequence-wise dependencies. To address
this, we present ParaRNN, a framework that breaks the sequence-parallelization
barrier for nonlinear RNNs. Building on prior work, we cast the sequence of
nonlinear recurrence relationships as a single system of equations, which we
solve in parallel using Newton's iterations combined with custom parallel
reductions. Our implementation achieves speedups of up to 665x over naive
sequential application, allowing training nonlinear RNNs at unprecedented
scales. To showcase this, we apply ParaRNN to adaptations of LSTM and GRU
architectures, successfully training models of 7B parameters that attain
perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and Mamba2 architectures.
To accelerate research in efficient sequence modeling, we release the ParaRNN
codebase as an open-source framework for automatic training-parallelization of
nonlinear RNNs, enabling researchers and practitioners to explore new nonlinear
RNN models at scale.

Motivation: 随着推荐系统复杂度的增加，解释系统输出变得至关重要。用户上传的照片往往是为了强化或证明他们对物品的评价，因此预测用户会拍摄的照片可以作为最有效的解释方式。

Result: 通过预测用户可能拍摄的照片，推荐系统能够解释其推荐结果，同时企业可以了解客户关注的产品特性。

Conclusion: 将个性化解释作为推荐学习的方法能够提高推荐系统的可靠性，并为企业提供关于客户偏好的生动知识。

Abstract: Explaining the output of a complex system, such as a Recommender System (RS),
is becoming of utmost importance for both users and companies. In this paper we
explore the idea that personalized explanations can be learned as
recommendation themselves. There are plenty of online services where users can
upload some photos, in addition to rating items. We assume that users take
these photos to reinforce or justify their opinions about the items. For this
reason we try to predict what photo a user would take of an item, because that
image is the argument that can best convince her of the qualities of the item.
In this sense, an RS can explain its results and, therefore, increase its
reliability. Furthermore, once we have a model to predict attractive images for
users, we can estimate their distribution. Thus, the companies acquire a vivid
knowledge about the aspects that the clients highlight of their products. The
paper includes a formal framework that estimates the authorship probability for
a given pair (user, photo). To illustrate the proposal, we use data gathered
from TripAdvisor containing the reviews (with photos) of restaurants in six
cities of different sizes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果机器学习方法通常假设已知暴露映射，这在现实中往往不切实际；同时同质性和处理分配机制的相互作用会导致网络级协变量偏移，影响处理效应估计的准确性。

Method: HINet方法整合图神经网络和领域对抗训练，能够在未知暴露映射的情况下估计处理效应，并减轻网络级协变量偏移的影响。

Result: 在合成和半合成网络数据集上的广泛实证评估证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: HINet方法成功解决了网络环境中异质处理效应估计的关键挑战，特别是在未知暴露映射和协变量偏移问题方面表现出色。

Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in network settings is complicated
by interference, meaning that the outcome of an instance can be influenced by
the treatment status of others. Existing causal machine learning approaches
usually assume a known exposure mapping that summarizes how the outcome of a
given instance is influenced by others' treatment, a simplification that is
often unrealistic. Furthermore, the interaction between homophily -- the
tendency of similar instances to connect -- and the treatment assignment
mechanism can induce a network-level covariate shift that may lead to
inaccurate treatment effect estimates, a phenomenon that has not yet been
explicitly studied. To address these challenges, we propose HINet, a novel
method that integrates graph neural networks with domain adversarial training.
This combination allows estimating treatment effects under unknown exposure
mappings while mitigating the impact of (network-level) covariate shift. An
extensive empirical evaluation on synthetic and semi-synthetic network datasets
demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Few-shot node classification on hypergraphs requires models that generalize
from scarce labels while capturing high-order structures. Existing hypergraph
neural networks (HNNs) effectively encode such structures but often suffer from
overfitting and scalability issues due to complex, black-box architectures. In
this work, we propose ZEN (Zero-Parameter Hypergraph Neural Network), a fully
linear and parameter-free model that achieves both expressiveness and
efficiency. Built upon a unified formulation of linearized HNNs, ZEN introduces
a tractable closed-form solution for the weight matrix and a redundancy-aware
propagation scheme to avoid iterative training and to eliminate redundant self
information. On 11 real-world hypergraph benchmarks, ZEN consistently
outperforms eight baseline models in classification accuracy while achieving up
to 696x speedups over the fastest competitor. Moreover, the decision process of
ZEN is fully interpretable, providing insights into the characteristic of a

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting (CF) poses a persistent challenge in continual

characterized by non-i.i.d. time series data. While existing research has
largely focused on classification tasks in vision domains, the regression-based

underexplored. In this paper, we present the first benchmarking framework
tailored to investigate CF in federated continual time series forecasting.
Using the Beijing Multi-site Air Quality dataset across 12 decentralized
clients, we systematically evaluate several CF mitigation strategies, including
Replay, Elastic Weight Consolidation, Learning without Forgetting, and Synaptic
Intelligence. Key contributions include: (i) introducing a new benchmark for CF
in time series FL, (ii) conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of
state-of-the-art methods, and (iii) releasing a reproducible open-source
framework. This work provides essential tools and insights for advancing
continual learning in federated time-series forecasting systems.

Motivation: 传统工作主要关注经验均值估计器的均匀收敛(P-Glivenko-Cantelli)，本文旨在超越这一限制，研究更一般的均匀均值估计问题。

Method: 在分布集合的均值向量空间上工作，分析均值向量的可分性条件，并构造非可分但UME可学的分布集合。

Result: 证明均值向量的可分性是UME可学的充分条件，但不是必要条件；构造了非可分但UME可学的分布集合；证明了UME可学集合的可数并也是UME可学的。

Conclusion: 解决了Cohen等人(2025)提出的猜想，建立了均匀均值可估性的新理论框架，揭示了可分性条件与均匀估计能力之间的复杂关系。

Abstract: We characterize conditions under which collections of distributions on
$\{0,1\}^\mathbb{N}$ admit uniform estimation of their mean. Prior work from
Vapnik and Chervonenkis (1971) has focused on uniform convergence using the
empirical mean estimator, leading to the principle known as $P-$
Glivenko-Cantelli. We extend this framework by moving beyond the empirical mean
estimator and introducing Uniform Mean Estimability, also called $UME-$
learnability, which captures when a collection permits uniform mean estimation
by any arbitrary estimator. We work on the space created by the mean vectors of
the collection of distributions. For each distribution, the mean vector records
the expected value in each coordinate. We show that separability of the mean
vectors is a sufficient condition for $UME-$ learnability. However, we show
that separability of the mean vectors is not necessary for $UME-$ learnability
by constructing a collection of distributions whose mean vectors are
non-separable yet $UME-$ learnable using techniques fundamentally different
from those used in our separability-based analysis. Finally, we establish that
countable unions of $UME-$ learnable collections are also $UME-$ learnable,
solving a conjecture posed in Cohen et al. (2025).

Abstract: Generative flow networks are able to sample, via sequential construction,
high-reward, complex objects according to a reward function. However, such
reward functions are often estimated approximately from noisy data, leading to
epistemic uncertainty in the learnt policy. We present an approach to quantify
this uncertainty by constructing a surrogate model composed of a polynomial
chaos expansion, fit on a small ensemble of trained flow networks. This model
learns the relationship between reward functions, parametrised in a
low-dimensional space, and the probability distributions over actions at each
step along a trajectory of the flow network. The surrogate model can then be
used for inexpensive Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the uncertainty in the
policy given uncertain rewards. We illustrate the performance of our approach
on a discrete and continuous grid-world, symbolic regression, and a Bayesian
structure learning task.

*Huatian Gong,Jiuh-Biing Sheu,Zheng Wang,Xiaoguang Yang,Ran Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出统一模型(UM)解决无人机灾后道路评估中的8种路由变体问题，通过单一神经网络处理多种配置，显著减少训练时间和参数，在解质量和实时性上优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化方法扩展性差，现有深度强化学习方法需要为每个问题变体训练单独模型，缺乏适应性，难以应对动态灾害场景的演化需求。

Method: 使用现代transformer编码器-解码器架构，通过多问题配置训练单一神经网络，结合轻量级适配器机制实现对新属性的高效微调。

Result: UM将训练时间和参数减少8倍，解质量比单任务DRL方法提高6-14%，比传统优化方法提高24-82%，在1000节点网络中实现1-10秒实时求解。

Conclusion: UM为时间关键型应用推进了神经组合优化，提供了计算高效、高质量且适应性强的无人机灾后道路评估解决方案。

Abstract: Post-disaster road assessment (PDRA) is essential for emergency response,
enabling rapid evaluation of infrastructure conditions and efficient allocation
of resources. Although drones provide a flexible and effective tool for PDRA,
routing them in large-scale networks remains challenging. Traditional
optimization methods scale poorly and demand domain expertise, while existing
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches adopt a single-task paradigm,
requiring separate models for each problem variant and lacking adaptability to
evolving operational needs. This study proposes a unified model (UM) for drone
routing that simultaneously addresses eight PDRA variants. By training a single
neural network across multiple problem configurations, UM captures shared
structural knowledge while adapting to variant-specific constraints through a
modern transformer encoder-decoder architecture. A lightweight adapter
mechanism further enables efficient finetuning to unseen attributes without
retraining, enhancing deployment flexibility in dynamic disaster scenarios.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the UM reduces training time and
parameters by a factor of eight compared with training separate models, while
consistently outperforming single-task DRL methods by 6--14\% and traditional
optimization approaches by 24--82\% in terms of solution quality (total
collected information value). The model achieves real-time solutions (1--10
seconds) across networks of up to 1,000 nodes, with robustness confirmed
through sensitivity analyses. Moreover, finetuning experiments show that unseen
attributes can be effectively incorporated with minimal cost while retaining
high solution quality. The proposed UM advances neural combinatorial
optimization for time-critical applications, offering a computationally
efficient, high-quality, and adaptable solution for drone-based PDRA.

### [206] [Probe-based Fine-tuning for Reducing Toxicity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21531)
*Jan Wehner,Mario Fritz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了使用探针作为训练信号时的Goodhart定律问题，提出了两种基于监督微调和直接偏好优化的训练方法，发现在减少毒性任务中，探针训练能保持检测能力，且重新训练探针比使用探针集成更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探针能检测模型内部的不良行为（如欺骗或偏见），但将其作为训练目标可能导致检测失效（Goodhart定律），需要研究如何在使用探针训练时保持其可靠性。

Method: 提出两种训练方法：基于监督微调和直接偏好优化；在毒性减少测试平台上评估，尝试使用探针集成、保留未训练探针和训练后重新训练探针来保持检测准确性。

Result: 探针偏好优化比基于分类器的方法更好地保持了探针检测能力；探针多样性带来的益处有限，训练后重新训练探针即可恢复高检测准确率。

Conclusion: 探针训练在某些对齐方法中是可行的，当重新训练可行时，探针集成基本没有必要。

Abstract: Probes trained on model activations can detect undesirable behaviors like
deception or biases that are difficult to identify from outputs alone. This
makes them useful detectors to identify misbehavior. Furthermore, they are also
valuable training signals, since they not only reward outputs, but also good
internal processes for arriving at that output. However, training against
interpretability tools raises a fundamental concern: when a monitor becomes a
training target, it may cease to be reliable (Goodhart's Law). We propose two
methods for training against probes based on Supervised Fine-tuning and Direct
Preference Optimization. We conduct an initial exploration of these methods in
a testbed for reducing toxicity and evaluate the amount by which probe accuracy
drops when training against them. To retain the accuracy of probe-detectors
after training, we attempt (1) to train against an ensemble of probes, (2)
retain held-out probes that aren't used for training, and (3) retrain new
probes after training.
  First, probe-based preference optimization unexpectedly preserves probe
detectability better than classifier-based methods, suggesting the preference
learning objective incentivizes maintaining rather than obfuscating relevant
representations. Second, probe diversity provides minimal practical benefit -
simply retraining probes after optimization recovers high detection accuracy.
Our findings suggest probe-based training can be viable for certain alignment
methods, though probe ensembles are largely unnecessary when retraining is
feasible.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为生成相关流形(GCM)的计算高效方法，通过Cholesky分解目标相关矩阵生成合成数据，数学上保证保留源数据集的完整相关结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前合成数据生成方法往往只能复制简单统计量，但无法保留定义真实世界系统复杂多变量交互的成对和高阶相关结构，导致合成数据在复杂建模任务中失效。

Method: 使用Cholesky分解目标相关矩阵来生成合成数据，数学证明该方法能保留从简单成对关系到高阶交互的完整相关结构。

Result: 该方法能够生成保留完整相关结构的合成数据，计算效率高。

Conclusion: GCM方法为合成数据生成提供了新途径，在隐私保护数据共享、鲁棒模型训练和仿真方面具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: The increasing need for data privacy and the demand for robust machine
learning models have fueled the development of synthetic data generation
techniques. However, current methods often succeed in replicating simple
summary statistics but fail to preserve both the pairwise and higher-order
correlation structure of the data that define the complex, multi-variable
interactions inherent in real-world systems. This limitation can lead to
synthetic data that is superficially realistic but fails when used for
sophisticated modeling tasks. In this white paper, we introduce Generative
Correlation Manifolds (GCM), a computationally efficient method for generating
synthetic data. The technique uses Cholesky decomposition of a target
correlation matrix to produce datasets that, by mathematical proof, preserve
the entire correlation structure -- from simple pairwise relationships to
higher-order interactions -- of the source dataset. We argue that this method
provides a new approach to synthetic data generation with potential
applications in privacy-preserving data sharing, robust model training, and
simulation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为时空区域扭曲（SRD）的伪异常生成方法，通过在正常视频的局部区域应用严重增强来创建合成异常，同时保持时间一致性。结合这些精确标注的合成异常和噪声伪标签，显著减少了标签噪声，实现了有效的对抗训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弱监督视频异常检测（WSVAD）模型容易受到对抗攻击的限制，但由于弱监督的固有约束（仅提供视频级标签但需要帧级预测），传统的对抗防御机制（如对抗训练）效果不佳。伪标签虽然可以实现帧级对抗训练，但存在严重噪声问题。

Method: 提出时空区域扭曲（SRD）方法，通过在正常视频的局部区域应用严重增强来创建合成异常，同时保持时间一致性。将这些精确标注的合成异常与噪声伪标签结合，减少标签噪声，实现有效的对抗训练。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法显著提高了WSVAD模型对对抗攻击的鲁棒性，在整体AUROC性能上平均优于最先进方法71.0%。

Conclusion: 提出的SRD方法通过生成精确标注的合成异常，有效减少了伪标签的噪声，实现了有效的对抗训练，显著提升了弱监督视频异常检测模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection (WSVAD) has achieved notable
advancements, yet existing models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
limiting their reliability. Due to the inherent constraints of weak
supervision, where only video-level labels are provided despite the need for
frame-level predictions, traditional adversarial defense mechanisms, such as
adversarial training, are not effective since video-level adversarial
perturbations are typically weak and inadequate. To address this limitation,
pseudo-labels generated directly from the model can enable frame-level
adversarial training; however, these pseudo-labels are inherently noisy,
significantly degrading performance. We therefore introduce a novel
Pseudo-Anomaly Generation method called Spatiotemporal Region Distortion (SRD),
which creates synthetic anomalies by applying severe augmentations to localized
regions in normal videos while preserving temporal consistency. Integrating
these precisely annotated synthetic anomalies with the noisy pseudo-labels
substantially reduces label noise, enabling effective adversarial training.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the
robustness of WSVAD models against adversarial attacks, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods by an average of 71.0\% in overall AUROC performance
across multiple benchmarks. The implementation and code are publicly available
at https://github.com/rohban-lab/FrameShield.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了修订相似性问题，并设计了一种新的静态度量方法——切除分数(ES)，通过移除现有文档与修订版本之间的共享内容，专注于比较差异区域，从而更好地与人类判断对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的成对度量方法（如BLEU）在评估文档修订时存在根本缺陷，因为它们的分数被共享内容主导，无法准确反映人类对修订差异的判断。

Method: 提出切除分数(ES)，使用最长公共子序列(LCS)移除现有文档与真实修订和预测修订之间的共享内容，然后仅比较剩余的差异区域。通过近似方法将标准立方LCS计算加速到二次复杂度。

Result: 在代码编辑评估中，ES显著优于现有度量方法。在HumanEvalFix上，ES比最接近的竞争对手SARI提高了12%的皮尔逊相关性，比标准度量如BLEU提高了>21%。当增加共享上下文时，ES的改进进一步增加到20%和>30%。

Conclusion: ES通过专注于修订的差异区域而非共享内容，提供了一种更符合人类判断的修订相似性度量方法，能够正确处理代码块移动、插入删除等复杂情况。

Abstract: Many tasks revolve around editing a document, whether code or text. We
formulate the revision similarity problem to unify a wide range of machine
learning evaluation problems whose goal is to assess a revision to an existing
document. We observe that revisions usually change only a small portion of an
existing document, so the existing document and its immediate revisions share a
majority of their content. We formulate five adequacy criteria for revision
similarity measures, designed to align them with human judgement. We show that
popular pairwise measures, like BLEU, fail to meet these criteria, because
their scores are dominated by the shared content. They report high similarity
between two revisions when humans would assess them as quite different. This is
a fundamental flaw we address. We propose a novel static measure, Excision
Score (ES), which computes longest common subsequence (LCS) to remove content
shared by an existing document with the ground truth and predicted revisions,
before comparing only the remaining divergent regions. This is analogous to a
surgeon creating a sterile field to focus on the work area. We use
approximation to speed the standard cubic LCS computation to quadratic. In
code-editing evaluation, where static measures are often used as a cheap proxy
for passing tests, we demonstrate that ES surpasses existing measures. When
aligned with test execution on HumanEvalFix, ES improves over its nearest
competitor, SARI, by 12% Pearson correlation and by >21% over standard measures
like BLEU. The key criterion is invariance to shared context; when we perturb
HumanEvalFix with increased shared context, ES' improvement over SARI increases
to 20% and >30% over standard measures. ES also handles other corner cases that
other measures do not, such as correctly aligning moved code blocks, and
appropriately rewarding matching insertions or deletions.

Motivation: 空天地一体化边缘计算为低空经济提供灵活广域计算服务，但面临异构节点协调、复杂因素建模和部分可观测环境下实时决策等挑战。

Method: 采用分层架构协调用户设备、无人机和卫星，提出MADDPG-COCG算法：MADDPG处理连续时序决策，凸优化联盟博弈处理混合变维决策。

Conclusion: MADDPG-COCG算法有效解决了空天地一体化边缘计算中的复杂优化问题，提升了用户中心性能表现。

Abstract: Space-air-ground integrated multi-access edge computing (SAGIN-MEC) provides
a promising solution for the rapidly developing low-altitude economy (LAE) to
deliver flexible and wide-area computing services. However, fully realizing the
potential of SAGIN-MEC in the LAE presents significant challenges, including
coordinating decisions across heterogeneous nodes with different roles,
modeling complex factors such as mobility and network variability, and handling
real-time decision-making under partially observable environment with hybrid
variables. To address these challenges, we first present a hierarchical
SAGIN-MEC architecture that enables the coordination between user devices
(UDs), uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), and satellites. Then, we formulate a UD
cost minimization optimization problem (UCMOP) to minimize the UD cost by
jointly optimizing the task offloading ratio, UAV trajectory planning,
computing resource allocation, and UD association. We show that the UCMOP is an
NP-hard problem. To overcome this challenge, we propose a multi-agent deep
deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG)-convex optimization and coalitional game
(MADDPG-COCG) algorithm. Specifically, we employ the MADDPG algorithm to
optimize the continuous temporal decisions for heterogeneous nodes in the
partially observable SAGIN-MEC system. Moreover, we propose a convex
optimization and coalitional game (COCG) method to enhance the conventional
MADDPG by deterministically handling the hybrid and varying-dimensional
decisions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MADDPG-COCG
algorithm significantly enhances the user-centric performances in terms of the
aggregated UD cost, task completion delay, and UD energy consumption, with a
slight increase in UAV energy consumption, compared to the benchmark
algorithms. Moreover, the MADDPG-COCG algorithm shows superior convergence
stability and scalability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键环境中部署强化学习受到分布偏移脆弱性的限制，需要有效的OOD检测方法。

Method: DEEDEE使用两个统计量：episodewise均值和RBF核相似度，捕捉训练摘要的全局和局部偏差，形成轻量级检测管道。

Result: DEEDEE在标准RL OOD测试套件中匹配或超越当代检测器，计算量减少600倍，平均准确率提升5%。

Conclusion: 结果表明，多样异常类型通常通过少量低阶统计量在RL轨迹中留下印记，为复杂环境中的OOD检测提供了紧凑基础。

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in safety-critical settings is
constrained by brittleness under distribution shift. We study
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection for RL time series and introduce DEEDEE, a
two-statistic detector that revisits representation-heavy pipelines with a
minimal alternative. DEEDEE uses only an episodewise mean and an RBF kernel
similarity to a training summary, capturing complementary global and local
deviations. Despite its simplicity, DEEDEE matches or surpasses contemporary
detectors across standard RL OOD suites, delivering a 600-fold reduction in
compute (FLOPs / wall-time) and an average 5% absolute accuracy gain over
strong baselines. Conceptually, our results indicate that diverse anomaly types
often imprint on RL trajectories through a small set of low-order statistics,
suggesting a compact foundation for OOD detection in complex environments.

Conclusion: ZETA展示了将ECG分析与结构化临床知识对齐的潜力，可构建更透明、可泛化和可信赖的AI诊断系统。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation is essential for cardiovascular
disease diagnosis, but current automated systems often struggle with
transparency and generalization to unseen conditions. To address this, we
introduce ZETA, a zero-shot multimodal framework designed for interpretable ECG
diagnosis aligned with clinical workflows. ZETA uniquely compares ECG signals
against structured positive and negative clinical observations, which are
curated through an LLM-assisted, expert-validated process, thereby mimicking
differential diagnosis. Our approach leverages a pre-trained multimodal model
to align ECG and text embeddings without disease-specific fine-tuning.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate ZETA's competitive zero-shot classification
performance and, importantly, provide qualitative and quantitative evidence of
enhanced interpretability, grounding predictions in specific, clinically
relevant positive and negative diagnostic features. ZETA underscores the
potential of aligning ECG analysis with structured clinical knowledge for
building more transparent, generalizable, and trustworthy AI diagnostic
systems. We will release the curated observation dataset and code to facilitate
future research.

Conclusion: 将经典算法先验嵌入GNN能为复杂真实世界图数据提供有用的归纳偏置，显著提升预测性能。

Abstract: Neural networks excel at processing unstructured data but often fail to
generalise out-of-distribution, whereas classical algorithms guarantee
correctness but lack flexibility. We explore whether pretraining Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) on classical algorithms can improve their performance on
molecular property prediction tasks from the Open Graph Benchmark: ogbg-molhiv
(HIV inhibition) and ogbg-molclintox (clinical toxicity). GNNs trained on 24
classical algorithms from the CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark are used to
initialise and freeze selected layers of a second GNN for molecular prediction.
Compared to a randomly initialised baseline, the pretrained models achieve
consistent wins or ties, with the Segments Intersect algorithm pretraining
yielding a 6% absolute gain on ogbg-molhiv and Dijkstra pretraining achieving a
3% gain on ogbg-molclintox. These results demonstrate embedding classical
algorithmic priors into GNNs provides useful inductive biases, boosting
performance on complex, real-world graph data.

Motivation: 理解深度神经网络如何创建有意义的表示并实现泛化的内部机制，特别是表征隐藏表示的语义内容和解释泛化现象。

Method: 开发了Gride方法来估计数据的内在维度；研究隐藏层概率密度的演化；分析宽神经网络中冗余表示的出现条件。

Conclusion: 深度神经网络通过分层密度峰值构建语义表示，冗余表示有助于泛化而非导致过拟合，这挑战了传统的偏差-方差权衡理论。

Abstract: The goal of this thesis is to improve our understanding of the internal
mechanisms by which deep artificial neural networks create meaningful
representations and are able to generalize. We focus on the challenge of
characterizing the semantic content of the hidden representations with
unsupervised learning tools, partially developed by us and described in this
thesis, which allow harnessing the low-dimensional structure of the data.
Chapter 2. introduces Gride, a method that allows estimating the intrinsic
dimension of the data as an explicit function of the scale without performing
any decimation of the data set. Our approach is based on rigorous
distributional results that enable the quantification of uncertainty of the
estimates. Moreover, our method is simple and computationally efficient since
it relies only on the distances among nearest data points. In Chapter 3, we
study the evolution of the probability density across the hidden layers in some
state-of-the-art deep neural networks. We find that the initial layers generate
a unimodal probability density getting rid of any structure irrelevant to
classification. In subsequent layers, density peaks arise in a hierarchical
fashion that mirrors the semantic hierarchy of the concepts. This process
leaves a footprint in the probability density of the output layer, where the
topography of the peaks allows reconstructing the semantic relationships of the
categories. In Chapter 4, we study the problem of generalization in deep neural
networks: adding parameters to a network that interpolates its training data
will typically improve its generalization performance, at odds with the
classical bias-variance trade-off. We show that wide neural networks learn
redundant representations instead of overfitting to spurious correlation and
that redundant neurons appear only if the network is regularized and the
training error is zero.

Motivation: 现有EEG基础模型难以处理公共数据集的异质性（不同协议、设备和电极配置），导致泛化能力差，特别是在线性探测下表现不佳。

Method: 引入4D位置编码方案处理任意长度和电极排列的信号，使用掩码自编码目标在92个数据集（60,000小时EEG数据，25,000名受试者）上进行预训练。

Abstract: Foundation models have transformed AI by reducing reliance on task-specific
data through large-scale pretraining. While successful in language and vision,
their adoption in EEG has lagged due to the heterogeneity of public datasets,
which are collected under varying protocols, devices, and electrode
configurations. Existing EEG foundation models struggle to generalize across
these variations, often restricting pretraining to a single setup, resulting in
suboptimal performance, in particular under linear probing. We present REVE
(Representation for EEG with Versatile Embeddings), a pretrained model
explicitly designed to generalize across diverse EEG signals. REVE introduces a
novel 4D positional encoding scheme that enables it to process signals of
arbitrary length and electrode arrangement. Using a masked autoencoding
objective, we pretrain REVE on over 60,000 hours of EEG data from 92 datasets
spanning 25,000 subjects, representing the largest EEG pretraining effort to
date. REVE achieves state-of-the-art results on 10 downstream EEG tasks,
including motor imagery classification, seizure detection, sleep staging,
cognitive load estimation, and emotion recognition. With little to no
fine-tuning, it demonstrates strong generalization, and nuanced spatio-temporal
modeling. We release code, pretrained weights, and tutorials to support
standardized EEG research and accelerate progress in clinical neuroscience.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据驱动深度学习方法需要大量解对数据，这些数据通常通过传统数值方法生成，需要数千个时间步迭代，远多于训练所需的几十个，造成沉重的计算和时间开销。

Method: 首先从可靠求解器获取基础解函数，通过下采样对齐时间步；然后提出"同源扰动"方法，将两个解函数（一个作为主函数，另一个作为同源扰动项）与随机噪声结合，高效生成精度相当的PDE数据点；最后计算原始方程右端项变化形成新的解对。

Result: 理论和实验结果表明HOPSS降低了时间复杂度。例如在Navier-Stokes方程上，生成10,000个样本仅需传统方法约10%的时间，且模型训练性能相当。

Conclusion: HOPSS算法能够显著加速PDE训练数据集的生成，同时保持模型训练所需的近似精度，为解决非线性时间偏微分方程的数据生成问题提供了高效方案。

Abstract: Data-driven deep learning methods like neural operators have advanced in
solving nonlinear temporal partial differential equations (PDEs). However,
these methods require large quantities of solution pairs\u2014the solution
functions and right-hand sides (RHS) of the equations. These pairs are
typically generated via traditional numerical methods, which need thousands of
time steps iterations far more than the dozens required for training, creating
heavy computational and temporal overheads. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel data generation algorithm, called HOmologous Perturbation in
Solution Space (HOPSS), which directly generates training datasets with fewer
time steps rather than following the traditional approach of generating large
time steps datasets. This algorithm simultaneously accelerates dataset
generation and preserves the approximate precision required for model training.
Specifically, we first obtain a set of base solution functions from a reliable
solver, usually with thousands of time steps, and then align them in time steps
with training datasets by downsampling. Subsequently, we propose a "homologous
perturbation" approach: by combining two solution functions (one as the primary
function, the other as a homologous perturbation term scaled by a small scalar)
with random noise, we efficiently generate comparable-precision PDE data
points. Finally, using these data points, we compute the variation in the
original equation's RHS to form new solution pairs. Theoretical and
experimental results show HOPSS lowers time complexity. For example, on the
Navier-Stokes equation, it generates 10,000 samples in approximately 10% of
traditional methods' time, with comparable model training performance.

time for simple models like decision trees, they unfortunately become NP-hard
to compute for more expressive black-box models like neural networks - where
generating explanations is often most critical. In this work, we analyze the
problem of computing SHAP explanations for *Tensor Networks (TNs)*, a broader
and more expressive class of models than those for which current exact SHAP
algorithms are known to hold, and which is widely used for neural network
abstraction and compression. First, we introduce a general framework for
computing provably exact SHAP explanations for general TNs with arbitrary
structures. Interestingly, we show that, when TNs are restricted to a *Tensor
Train (TT)* structure, SHAP computation can be performed in *poly-logarithmic*
time using *parallel* computation. Thanks to the expressiveness power of TTs,
this complexity result can be generalized to many other popular ML models such
as decision trees, tree ensembles, linear models, and linear RNNs, therefore
tightening previously reported complexity results for these families of models.
Finally, by leveraging reductions of binarized neural networks to Tensor
Network representations, we demonstrate that SHAP computation can become
*efficiently tractable* when the network's *width* is fixed, while it remains
computationally hard even with constant *depth*. This highlights an important
insight: for this class of models, width - rather than depth - emerges as the
primary computational bottleneck in SHAP computation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了广义流映射(GFM)，一种新的少步生成模型，将欧几里得空间中的流映射框架推广到任意黎曼流形，在几何数据生成中实现了最先进的样本质量和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前几何生成模型在推理时计算成本高昂，需要复杂的数值模拟步骤，限制了在实际应用中的效率。

Method: 提出了三种基于自蒸馏的训练方法：广义拉格朗日流映射、广义欧拉流映射和广义渐进流映射，将一致性模型、捷径模型和均值流等欧几里得少步生成模型统一并提升到黎曼流形设置。

Result: 在几何数据集（包括地理空间数据、RNA扭转角和双曲流形）上的基准测试显示，GFM在单步和少步评估中实现了最先进的样本质量，并使用隐式概率流获得了优越或具有竞争力的对数似然。

Conclusion: GFM为几何数据生成提供了一种计算效率高的少步生成模型框架，在保持高质量样本生成的同时显著减少了推理步骤。

Abstract: Geometric data and purpose-built generative models on them have become
ubiquitous in high-impact deep learning application domains, ranging from
protein backbone generation and computational chemistry to geospatial data.
Current geometric generative models remain computationally expensive at
inference -- requiring many steps of complex numerical simulation -- as they
are derived from dynamical measure transport frameworks such as diffusion and
flow-matching on Riemannian manifolds. In this paper, we propose Generalised
Flow Maps (GFM), a new class of few-step generative models that generalises the
Flow Map framework in Euclidean spaces to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. We
instantiate GFMs with three self-distillation-based training methods:
Generalised Lagrangian Flow Maps, Generalised Eulerian Flow Maps, and
Generalised Progressive Flow Maps. We theoretically show that GFMs, under
specific design decisions, unify and elevate existing Euclidean few-step
generative models, such as consistency models, shortcut models, and meanflows,
to the Riemannian setting. We benchmark GFMs against other geometric generative
models on a suite of geometric datasets, including geospatial data, RNA torsion
angles, and hyperbolic manifolds, and achieve state-of-the-art sample quality
for single- and few-step evaluations, and superior or competitive
log-likelihoods using the implicit probability flow.

*Maximilien Dreveton,Elaine Siyu Liu,Matthias Grossglauser,Patrick Thiran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文建立了在流行度调整块模型(PABM)下图聚类的理论极限，揭示了传统模型忽略的聚类可分离性维度，并证明使用k²个特征向量的谱聚类方法优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图聚类模型如SBM和DCBM存在局限性：SBM假设顶点度均匀，DCBM在集群间应用统一的度校正。PABM通过为集群内和集群间连接引入独立流行度参数，捕捉了DCBM忽略的度异质性维度。

Method: 在PABM框架下分析聚类最优错误率，研究谱嵌入方法。由于PABM的期望邻接矩阵秩在k到k²之间，传统使用前k个特征向量的谱聚类可能丢失重要结构信息，因此提出使用k²个特征向量的改进方法。

Result: 证明了在PABM中，即使传统边密度信号消失，只要集群内和集群间流行度系数不同，聚类恢复仍然可能。数值实验表明，使用k²个特征向量的谱聚类算法在合成和真实数据集上均优于传统方法。

Conclusion: PABM捕捉了传统模型忽略的度异质性重要维度，局部连接模式差异可独立于全局边密度增强聚类可分离性。为充分捕捉PABM的丰富结构，需要超越传统谱聚类方法。

Abstract: This paper establishes the theoretical limits of graph clustering under the
Popularity-Adjusted Block Model (PABM), addressing limitations of existing
models. In contrast to the Stochastic Block Model (SBM), which assumes uniform
vertex degrees, and to the Degree-Corrected Block Model (DCBM), which applies
uniform degree corrections across clusters, PABM introduces separate popularity
parameters for intra- and inter-cluster connections. Our main contribution is
the characterization of the optimal error rate for clustering under PABM, which
provides novel insights on clustering hardness: we demonstrate that unlike SBM
and DCBM, cluster recovery remains possible in PABM even when traditional
edge-density signals vanish, provided intra- and inter-cluster popularity
coefficients differ. This highlights a dimension of degree heterogeneity
captured by PABM but overlooked by DCBM: local differences in connectivity
patterns can enhance cluster separability independently of global edge
densities. Finally, because PABM exhibits a richer structure, its expected
adjacency matrix has rank between $k$ and $k^2$, where $k$ is the number of
clusters. As a result, spectral embeddings based on the top $k$ eigenvectors
may fail to capture important structural information. Our numerical experiments
on both synthetic and real datasets confirm that spectral clustering algorithms
incorporating $k^2$ eigenvectors outperform traditional spectral approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据稀疏场景（如机器人操作、分子物理等）中，等变网络能改善建模效果，但等变性与模型置信度、校准之间的关系尚未被研究。

Method: 通过理论证明在不同等变条件下的不确定性校准误差（ECE和ENCE）的上下界，并结合数值实验分析等变性与不确定性的关系。

Result: 阐明了等变模型的泛化限制，证明了对称性不匹配会导致分类和回归中的校准错误，并分析了对称性不匹配、群大小以及偶然和认知不确定性之间的关系。

Conclusion: 建立了等变性与不确定性估计的理论联系，为等变网络在不确定性校准方面的应用提供了理论基础和实验验证。

Abstract: Data-sparse settings such as robotic manipulation, molecular physics, and
galaxy morphology classification are some of the hardest domains for deep
learning. For these problems, equivariant networks can help improve modeling
across undersampled parts of the input space, and uncertainty estimation can
guard against overconfidence. However, until now, the relationships between
equivariance and model confidence, and more generally equivariance and model
calibration, has yet to be studied. Since traditional classification and
regression error terms show up in the definitions of calibration error, it is
natural to suspect that previous work can be used to help understand the
relationship between equivariance and calibration error. In this work, we
present a theory relating equivariance to uncertainty estimation. By proving
lower and upper bounds on uncertainty calibration errors (ECE and ENCE) under
various equivariance conditions, we elucidate the generalization limits of
equivariant models and illustrate how symmetry mismatch can result in
miscalibration in both classification and regression. We complement our
theoretical framework with numerical experiments that clarify the relationship
between equivariance and uncertainty using a variety of real and simulated
datasets, and we comment on trends with symmetry mismatch, group size, and
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties.

Result: 发现模型自然发展出反映基本TSP概念的特征：凸包边界检测器、对局部密集区域响应的聚类敏感特征、以及编码几何分隔的分隔符特征。

Conclusion: 这是首次对神经TSP求解器在节点选择前的计算进行模型内部解释，证明几何结构无需显式监督即可出现，为结合神经效率和算法可解释性的透明混合系统提供了路径。

Abstract: Neural networks have advanced combinatorial optimization, with
Transformer-based solvers achieving near-optimal solutions on the Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP) in milliseconds. However, these models operate as black
boxes, providing no insight into the geometric patterns they learn or the
heuristics they employ during tour construction. We address this opacity by
applying sparse autoencoders (SAEs), a mechanistic interpretability technique,
to a Transformer-based TSP solver, representing the first application of
activation-based interpretability methods to operations research models. We
train a pointer network with reinforcement learning on 100-node instances, then
fit an SAE to the encoder's residual stream to discover an overcomplete
dictionary of interpretable features. Our analysis reveals that the solver
naturally develops features mirroring fundamental TSP concepts: boundary
detectors that activate on convex-hull nodes, cluster-sensitive features
responding to locally dense regions, and separator features encoding geometric
partitions. These findings provide the first model-internal account of what
neural TSP solvers compute before node selection, demonstrate that geometric
structure emerges without explicit supervision, and suggest pathways toward
transparent hybrid systems that combine neural efficiency with algorithmic
interpretability. Interactive feature explorer:

TL;DR: 提出Equivariance by Contrast (EbC)方法，仅从观察对$(\mathbf{y}, g \cdot \mathbf{y})$学习等变嵌入，无需依赖群特定归纳偏置，成功演示了首个通用编码器专用等变学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在从群作用观察中学习等变嵌入，无需预先了解群结构或依赖群特定归纳偏置，实现通用等变表示学习。

Method: 联合学习潜在空间和群表示，使群作用对应可逆线性映射，通过对比学习从观察对$(\mathbf{y}, g \cdot \mathbf{y})$中提取等变性。

Result: 在无限dSprites数据集上验证了高保真等变性，群操作在潜在空间中忠实再现；在合成数据上验证了非阿贝尔正交群$O(n)$和一般线性群$GL(n)$；提供了可识别性理论证明。

Conclusion: EbC是首个仅从群作用观察成功学习等变嵌入的通用方法，包括非平凡非阿贝尔群和乘积群，为计算机视觉中仿射等变性建模提供了基础。

Abstract: We propose Equivariance by Contrast (EbC) to learn equivariant embeddings
from observation pairs $(\mathbf{y}, g \cdot \mathbf{y})$, where $g$ is drawn
from a finite group acting on the data. Our method jointly learns a latent
space and a group representation in which group actions correspond to
invertible linear maps -- without relying on group-specific inductive biases.
We validate our approach on the infinite dSprites dataset with structured
transformations defined by the finite group $G:= (R_m \times \mathbb{Z}_n
\times \mathbb{Z}_n)$, combining discrete rotations and periodic translations.
The resulting embeddings exhibit high-fidelity equivariance, with group
operations faithfully reproduced in latent space. On synthetic data, we further
validate the approach on the non-abelian orthogonal group $O(n)$ and the
general linear group $GL(n)$. We also provide a theoretical proof for
identifiability. While broad evaluation across diverse group types on
real-world data remains future work, our results constitute the first
successful demonstration of general-purpose encoder-only equivariant learning
from group action observations alone, including non-trivial non-abelian groups
and a product group motivated by modeling affine equivariances in computer
vision.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 果蝇嗅觉回路中的侧向抑制和神经元尖峰频率适应机制在复杂噪声环境下对气味辨别具有互补作用，侧向抑制在低中噪声下有效，而尖峰频率适应在所有噪声水平下都有效，两者结合可实现最佳辨别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究果蝇嗅觉回路中侧向抑制和神经元尖峰频率适应这两种看似功能相似的机制是否具有冗余性，以及它们在复杂环境噪声条件下对气味学习的模式分离作用。

Method: 构建果蝇嗅觉回路的计算模型，在不同噪声条件下模拟气味辨别过程，分析两种机制在不同噪声环境下的表现。

Result: 侧向抑制主要在低中噪声条件下增强气味辨别，但在高噪声条件下效果减弱甚至反转；尖峰频率适应在所有噪声水平下都能改善辨别性能；两种机制在不同噪声环境中优先发挥作用，组合使用时能实现最优辨别性能。

Conclusion: 生物回路中看似冗余的模块实际上在复杂环境中对实现最优学习至关重要，不同机制在不同环境条件下发挥互补作用。

Abstract: Biological circuits have evolved to incorporate multiple modules that perform
similar functions. In the fly olfactory circuit, both lateral inhibition (LI)
and neuronal spike frequency adaptation (SFA) are thought to enhance pattern
separation for odor learning. However, it remains unclear whether these
mechanisms play redundant or distinct roles in this process. In this study, we
present a computational model of the fly olfactory circuit to investigate odor
discrimination under varying noise conditions that simulate complex
environments. Our results show that LI primarily enhances odor discrimination
in low- and medium-noise scenarios, but this benefit diminishes and may reverse
under higher-noise conditions. In contrast, SFA consistently improves
discrimination across all noise levels. LI is preferentially engaged in low-
and medium-noise environments, whereas SFA dominates in high-noise settings.
When combined, these two sparsification mechanisms enable optimal
discrimination performance. This work demonstrates that seemingly redundant
modules in biological circuits can, in fact, be essential for achieving optimal
learning in complex contexts.

Motivation: 脉冲神经网络在视觉长序列建模任务中性能不足，需要分析其感受野特性来理解特征提取能力的局限性。

Result: 在Meta-SDT变体和目标检测、语义分割任务上的实验验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: ST-ERF框架为SNN架构设计和优化提供了有价值的见解，有望在更广泛的任务中发挥作用。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) demonstrate significant potential for
energy-efficient neuromorphic computing through an event-driven paradigm. While
training methods and computational models have greatly advanced, SNNs struggle
to achieve competitive performance in visual long-sequence modeling tasks. In
artificial neural networks, the effective receptive field (ERF) serves as a
valuable tool for analyzing feature extraction capabilities in visual
long-sequence modeling. Inspired by this, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal
Effective Receptive Field (ST-ERF) to analyze the ERF distributions across
various Transformer-based SNNs. Based on the proposed ST-ERF, we reveal that
these models suffer from establishing a robust global ST-ERF, thereby limiting
their visual feature modeling capabilities. To overcome this issue, we propose
two novel channel-mixer architectures:
\underline{m}ulti-\underline{l}ayer-\underline{p}erceptron-based
m\underline{ixer} (MLPixer) and \underline{s}plash-and-\underline{r}econstruct
\underline{b}lock (SRB). These architectures enhance global spatial ERF through
all timesteps in early network stages of Transformer-based SNNs, improving
performance on challenging visual long-sequence modeling tasks. Extensive
experiments conducted on the Meta-SDT variants and across object detection and
semantic segmentation tasks further validate the effectiveness of our proposed
method. Beyond these specific applications, we believe the proposed ST-ERF
framework can provide valuable insights for designing and optimizing SNN
architectures across a broader range of tasks. The code is available at

TL;DR: REvolution框架结合进化计算与LLM，通过双种群算法和自适应机制，显著提升RTL代码生成的功能正确性和PPA优化，解决了传统方法的局部搜索限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的RTL代码生成方法面临功能正确性和PPA优化两大挑战，迭代反馈方法局限于局部搜索，难以发现全局最优解。

Method: 采用进化计算与LLM结合的双种群算法，将候选设计分为失败组和成功组分别进行错误修复和PPA优化，并引入自适应机制动态调整提示策略的选择概率。

Result: 在VerilogEval和RTLLM基准测试中，REvolution将各种LLM的初始通过率提升最高达24.0个百分点，DeepSeek-V3模型最终通过率达到95.5%，且生成的RTL设计在PPA方面显著优于参考设计。

Conclusion: 该工作通过结合LLM的生成能力和进化计算的广泛搜索能力，克服了先前方法的局部搜索限制，为RTL设计引入了新方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are used for Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code
generation, but they face two main challenges: functional correctness and
Power, Performance, and Area (PPA) optimization. Iterative, feedback-based
methods partially address these, but they are limited to local search,
hindering the discovery of a global optimum. This paper introduces REvolution,
a framework that combines Evolutionary Computation (EC) with LLMs for automatic
RTL generation and optimization. REvolution evolves a population of candidates
in parallel, each defined by a design strategy, RTL implementation, and
evaluation feedback. The framework includes a dual-population algorithm that
divides candidates into Fail and Success groups for bug fixing and PPA
optimization, respectively. An adaptive mechanism further improves search
efficiency by dynamically adjusting the selection probability of each prompt
strategy according to its success rate. Experiments on the VerilogEval and
RTLLM benchmarks show that REvolution increased the initial pass rate of
various LLMs by up to 24.0 percentage points. The DeepSeek-V3 model achieved a
final pass rate of 95.5\%, comparable to state-of-the-art results, without the
need for separate training or domain-specific tools. Additionally, the
generated RTL designs showed significant PPA improvements over reference
designs. This work introduces a new RTL design approach by combining LLMs'
generative capabilities with EC's broad search power, overcoming the
local-search limitations of previous methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于区块链DEX路由的混合遗传算法，结合多目标NSGA-II和确定性基线优化器，在拍卖时限内实现用户盈余、gas费用、滑点和执行风险的多目标优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的确定性单目标启发式方法无法充分利用多路径分割机会，也难以统一处理gas、滑点和执行风险约束，因此需要更先进的优化方法。

Method: 采用混合遗传算法架构，包含多目标NSGA-II引擎和自适应控制器，编码可变长度路径集和连续分割比例，在用户盈余、gas、滑点和风险四个目标下进行帕累托优化。

Result: 在14层基准测试中，混合方法在中小订单上实现0.40-9.82 ETH的绝对用户盈余增益，中位收敛时间约0.5秒（软上限1.0秒），在2秒时限内完成。

Conclusion: 该混合方法能够有效处理DEX路由中的多目标优化问题，在实时约束下实现性能提升，且具有端到端的安全性保证。

Abstract: CoW Protocol batch auctions aggregate user intents and rely on solvers to
find optimal execution paths that maximize user surplus across heterogeneous
automated market makers (AMMs) under stringent auction deadlines. Deterministic
single-objective heuristics that optimize only expected output frequently fail
to exploit split-flow opportunities across multiple parallel paths and to
internalize gas, slippage, and execution risk constraints in a unified search.
We apply evolutionary multi-objective optimization to this blockchain routing
problem, proposing a hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) architecture for real-time
solver optimization that combines a production-grade, multi-objective NSGA-II
engine with adaptive instance profiling and deterministic baselines. Our core
engine encodes variable-length path sets with continuous split ratios and
evolves candidate route-and-volume allocations under a Pareto objective vector
F = (user surplus, -gas, -slippage, -risk), enabling principled trade-offs and
anytime operation within the auction deadline. An adaptive controller selects
between GA and a deterministic dual-decomposition optimizer with Bellman-Ford
based negative-cycle detection, with a guarantee to never underperform the
baseline. The open-source system integrates six protection layers and passes
8/8 tests, validating safety and correctness. In a 14-stratum benchmark (30
seeds each), the hybrid approach yields absolute user-surplus gains of
approximately 0.40-9.82 ETH on small-to-medium orders, while large
high-fragmentation orders are unprofitable across gas regimes. Convergence
occurs in about 0.5 s median (soft capped at 1.0 s) within a 2-second limit. We
are not aware of an openly documented multi-objective GA with end-to-end safety
for real-time DEX routing.

Method: 采用多模态大语言模型驱动的多智能体框架，结合感知提取、人工反馈、模式验证和自动化BIM脚本生成，将草图迭代优化为结构化JSON布局，再转换为可执行脚本生成3D BIM模型。

Result: 在10个不同平面图上的实验显示：门窗开口在初始阶段就具有高可靠性检测，墙体检测从83%开始，经过几次反馈迭代后达到近乎完美的对齐；所有类别的精确度、召回率和F1分数均保持在0.83以上，几何误差通过反馈修正逐渐降至零。

Conclusion: MLLM驱动的多智能体推理能够使BIM创建对专家和非专家都变得可访问，仅需使用徒手草图即可完成高质量的3D建模。

Abstract: This study introduces a human-in-the-loop pipeline that converts unscaled,
hand-drawn floor plan sketches into semantically consistent 3D BIM models. The
workflow leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) within a
multi-agent framework, combining perceptual extraction, human feedback, schema
validation, and automated BIM scripting. Initially, sketches are iteratively
refined into a structured JSON layout of walls, doors, and windows. Later,
these layouts are transformed into executable scripts that generate 3D BIM
models. Experiments on ten diverse floor plans demonstrate strong convergence:
openings (doors, windows) are captured with high reliability in the initial
pass, while wall detection begins around 83% and achieves near-perfect
alignment after a few feedback iterations. Across all categories, precision,
recall, and F1 scores remain above 0.83, and geometric errors (RMSE, MAE)
progressively decrease to zero through feedback corrections. This study
demonstrates how MLLM-driven multi-agent reasoning can make BIM creation
accessible to both experts and non-experts using only freehand sketches.

Motivation: 解决当前大语言模型在开放领域创意生成中要么陷入熟悉文化模式、要么牺牲连贯性追求新颖性的问题。

Method: 使用两个在WikiArt概念上微调的GPT-2模型：概念连贯性模型评估概念在艺术作品中共同出现的合理性，文化背景模型估计这些组合在艺术家作品中的典型程度。CAS选择高连贯性、低典型性的组合。

Result: 人类评估显示CAS在原创性和和谐度方面优于随机选择和GPT-4o基线，与艺术学生表现相当。定量研究显示该方法产生更多样化输出，探索更广泛概念空间。

Conclusion: 人工文化异化能够解锁自主代理的创意潜力，生成既新颖又连贯的创意概念。

Abstract: In open-ended domains like art, autonomous agents must generate ideas that
are both original and internally coherent, yet current Large Language Models
(LLMs) either default to familiar cultural patterns or sacrifice coherence when
pushed toward novelty. We address this by introducing the Cultural Alien
Sampler (CAS), a concept-selection method that explicitly separates
compositional fit from cultural typicality. CAS uses two GPT-2 models
fine-tuned on WikiArt concepts: a Concept Coherence Model that scores whether
concepts plausibly co-occur within artworks, and a Cultural Context Model that
estimates how typical those combinations are within individual artists' bodies
of work. CAS targets combinations that are high in coherence and low in
typicality, yielding ideas that maintain internal consistency while deviating
from learned conventions and embedded cultural context. In a human evaluation
(N = 100), our approach outperforms random selection and GPT-4o baselines and
achieves performance comparable to human art students in both perceived
originality and harmony. Additionally, a quantitative study shows that our
method produces more diverse outputs and explores a broader conceptual space
than its GPT-4o counterpart, demonstrating that artificial cultural alienness
can unlock creative potential in autonomous agents.

Abstract: Fuzzy numbers are commonly represented with fuzzy sets. Their objective is to
better represent imprecise data. However, operations on fuzzy numbers are not
as straightforward as maths on crisp numbers. Commonly, the Zadeh's extension
rule is applied to elaborate a result. This can produce two problems: (1) high
computational complexity and (2) for some fuzzy sets and some operations the
results is not a fuzzy set with the same features (eg. multiplication of two
triangular fuzzy sets does not produce a triangular fuzzy set). One more
problem is the fuzzy spread -- fuzziness of the result increases with the
number of operations. These facts can severely limit the application field of
fuzzy numbers. In this paper we would like to revisite this problem with a
different kind of fuzzy numbers -- extensional fuzzy numbers. The paper defines
operations on extensional fuzzy numbers and relational operators (=, >, >=, <,
<=) for them. The proposed approach is illustrated with several applicational
examples. The C++ implementation is available from a public GitHub repository.

TL;DR: 提出一个基于开源大语言模型的框架，用于从异构电子健康记录系统中提取标准化的阿片类药物使用障碍治疗处方数据，并计算药物覆盖天数指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决电子健康记录系统中药物数据格式不统一的问题，特别是阿片类药物使用障碍治疗处方的标准化提取，以支持跨机构的药物暴露、依从性和保留率分析。

Method: 定制开源大语言模型（Llama、Qwen、Gemma、MedGemma）从异构数据中提取统一处方属性，采用固定JSON模式处理记录，并进行轻量级归一化和跨字段一致性检查。

Result: 在5个诊所的25,605条记录上评估，Qwen2.5-32B达到93.4%覆盖率和93.0%准确率，MedGemma-27B达到93.1%/92.2%。识别并修复了三种常见错误类型。

Conclusion: 该方法消除了脆弱的站点特定ETL流程，支持本地隐私保护部署，能够实现跨站点MOUD暴露、依从性和保留率的一致性分析。

Abstract: Harmonizing medication data across Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems is
a persistent barrier to monitoring medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD).
In heterogeneous EHR systems, key prescription attributes are scattered across
differently formatted fields and freetext notes. We present a practical
framework that customizes open source large language models (LLMs), including
Llama, Qwen, Gemma, and MedGemma, to extract a unified set of MOUD prescription
attributes (prescription date, drug name, duration, total quantity, daily
quantity, and refills) from heterogeneous, site specific data and compute a
standardized metric of medication coverage, \emph{MOUD days}, per patient. Our
pipeline processes records directly in a fixed JSON schema, followed by
lightweight normalization and cross-field consistency checks. We evaluate the
system on prescription level EHR data from five clinics in a national OUD study
(25{,}605 records from 1{,}257 patients), using a previously annotated
benchmark of 10{,}369 records (776 patients) as the ground truth. Performance
is reported as coverage (share of records with a valid, matchable output) and
record-level exact-match accuracy. Larger models perform best overall:
Qwen2.5-32B achieves \textbf{93.4\%} coverage with \textbf{93.0\%} exact-match
accuracy across clinics, and MedGemma-27B attains
\textbf{93.1\%}/\textbf{92.2\%}. A brief error review highlights three common
issues and fixes: imputing missing dosage fields using within-drug norms,
handling monthly/weekly injectables (e.g., Vivitrol) by setting duration from
the documented schedule, and adding unit checks to prevent mass units (e.g.,
``250 g'') from being misread as daily counts. By removing brittle,
site-specific ETL and supporting local, privacy-preserving deployment, this
approach enables consistent cross-site analyses of MOUD exposure, adherence,
and retention in real-world settings.

TL;DR: 本文探讨AI何时应优先于人类专家判断，提出AI预占主义观点，但认为其存在放大风险，建议采用全证据视角将AI输出作为补充而非替代理由。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI系统作为人工认知权威时，何时应优先于人类专家判断，解决AI预占主义带来的认知风险问题。

Method: 基于社会认识论理论，分析AI预占主义的经典反对意见，并发展全证据视角的AI遵从理论。

Result: 提出全证据视角具有三个优势：缓解专业知识萎缩、支持有意义的人类监督、解释AI不可靠时的合理不信任。

Conclusion: 全证据视角为高风险情境下确定AI遵从的合理性提供了原则性方法，要求将AI输出作为补充理由而非完全替代。

Abstract: When should we defer to AI outputs over human expert judgment? Drawing on
recent work in social epistemology, I motivate the idea that some AI systems
qualify as Artificial Epistemic Authorities (AEAs) due to their demonstrated
reliability and epistemic superiority. I then introduce AI Preemptionism, the
view that AEA outputs should replace rather than supplement a user's
independent epistemic reasons. I show that classic objections to preemptionism
- such as uncritical deference, epistemic entrenchment, and unhinging epistemic
bases - apply in amplified form to AEAs, given their opacity, self-reinforcing
authority, and lack of epistemic failure markers. Against this, I develop a
more promising alternative: a total evidence view of AI deference. According to
this view, AEA outputs should function as contributory reasons rather than
outright replacements for a user's independent epistemic considerations. This
approach has three key advantages: (i) it mitigates expertise atrophy by
keeping human users engaged, (ii) it provides an epistemic case for meaningful
human oversight and control, and (iii) it explains the justified mistrust of AI
when reliability conditions are unmet. While demanding in practice, this
account offers a principled way to determine when AI deference is justified,
particularly in high-stakes contexts requiring rigorous reliability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种多智能体框架，用于将自然语言问题准确翻译为空间SQL查询，通过知识库、语义增强和协作式多智能体流水线解决空间查询的复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SQL的复杂性和PostGIS等工具中地理空间函数的专业性给非专家分析空间数据带来了显著障碍，现有单智能体方法在处理空间查询的语义和句法复杂性方面存在困难。

Method: 集成知识库（包含程序化模式分析和语义增强）、上下文检索嵌入以及协作式多智能体流水线，包括实体提取、元数据检索、查询逻辑制定、SQL生成和审查智能体进行程序化和语义验证。

Result: 在KaggleDBQA基准测试中达到81.2%的总体准确率（272个问题中的221个），在空间查询中达到87.7%的准确率（90个问题中的79个），比没有审查智能体的76.7%有明显提升。

Conclusion: 该工作使空间分析更加易于访问，为空间Text-to-SQL系统提供了强大且可推广的基础，推动了自主GIS的发展。

Abstract: The complexity of Structured Query Language (SQL) and the specialized nature
of geospatial functions in tools like PostGIS present significant barriers to
non-experts seeking to analyze spatial data. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
offer promise for translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL),
single-agent approaches often struggle with the semantic and syntactic
complexities of spatial queries. To address this, we propose a multi-agent
framework designed to accurately translate natural language questions into
spatial SQL queries. The framework integrates several innovative components,
including a knowledge base with programmatic schema profiling and semantic
enrichment, embeddings for context retrieval, and a collaborative multi-agent
pipeline as its core. This pipeline comprises specialized agents for entity
extraction, metadata retrieval, query logic formulation, SQL generation, and a
review agent that performs programmatic and semantic validation of the
generated SQL to ensure correctness (self-verification). We evaluate our system
using both the non-spatial KaggleDBQA benchmark and a new, comprehensive
SpatialQueryQA benchmark that includes diverse geometry types, predicates, and
three levels of query complexity. On KaggleDBQA, the system achieved an overall
accuracy of 81.2% (221 out of 272 questions) after the review agent's review
and corrections. For spatial queries, the system achieved an overall accuracy
of 87.7% (79 out of 90 questions), compared with 76.7% without the review
agent. Beyond accuracy, results also show that in some instances the system
generates queries that are more semantically aligned with user intent than
those in the benchmarks. This work makes spatial analysis more accessible, and
provides a robust, generalizable foundation for spatial Text-to-SQL systems,
advancing the development of autonomous GIS.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在医疗临床服务部署中面临三个关键挑战：幻觉回答、固定深度推理效率低下和多机构协作困难。

Method: 提出多模态直接偏好优化(mDPO)目标，设计检索感知专家混合(RA-MoE)架构，以及联邦治理机制实现自适应链式思维推理。

Result: 在三个代表性Med-VQA数据集上达到最先进性能，比强检索增强基线F1分数提升高达11.85%，平均推理长度比固定深度CoT方法减少51.60%。

Conclusion: MedAlign通过视觉对齐偏好学习、专家路由和联邦自适应推理，有效解决了医疗视觉问答中的关键挑战，实现了准确高效的临床服务部署。

Abstract: Recently, large models have shown significant potential for smart healthcare.
However, the deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for clinical
services is currently hindered by three critical challenges: a tendency to
hallucinate answers not grounded in visual evidence, the inefficiency of
fixed-depth reasoning, and the difficulty of multi-institutional collaboration.
To address these challenges, in this paper, we develop MedAlign, a novel
framework to ensure visually accurate LVLM responses for Medical Visual
Question Answering (Med-VQA). Specifically, we first propose a multimodal
Direct Preference Optimization (mDPO) objective to explicitly align preference
learning with visual context. We then design a Retrieval-Aware
Mixture-of-Experts (RA-MoE) architecture that utilizes image and text
similarity to route queries to a specialized and context-augmented LVLM (i.e.,
an expert), thereby mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. To achieve adaptive
reasoning and facilitate multi-institutional collaboration, we propose a
federated governance mechanism, where the selected expert, fine-tuned on
clinical datasets based on mDPO, locally performs iterative Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning via the local meta-cognitive uncertainty estimator. Extensive
experiments on three representative Med-VQA datasets demonstrate that MedAlign
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong retrieval-augmented
baselines by up to $11.85\%$ in F1-score, and simultaneously reducing the
average reasoning length by $51.60\%$ compared with fixed-depth CoT approaches.

Conclusion: 所提出的算法能够有效处理观测数据中的混淆偏差，在存在未观测混淆变量的复杂环境中提供更鲁棒的策略学习

Abstract: A key task in Artificial Intelligence is learning effective policies for
controlling agents in unknown environments to optimize performance measures.
Off-policy learning methods, like Q-learning, allow learners to make optimal
decisions based on past experiences. This paper studies off-policy learning
from biased data in complex and high-dimensional domains where \emph{unobserved
confounding} cannot be ruled out a priori. Building on the well-celebrated Deep
Q-Network (DQN), we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm
robust to confounding biases in observed data. Specifically, our algorithm
attempts to find a safe policy for the worst-case environment compatible with
the observations. We apply our method to twelve confounded Atari games, and
find that it consistently dominates the standard DQN in all games where the
observed input to the behavioral and target policies mismatch and unobserved
confounders exist.

Motivation: 现有代理框架通常遵循预定义工作流程，限制了自主性和全局任务完成能力，而现实世界任务需要外部工具和长时程交互。

Abstract: Large reasoning models have demonstrated strong problem-solving abilities,
yet real-world tasks often require external tools and long-horizon
interactions. Existing agent frameworks typically follow predefined workflows,
which limit autonomous and global task completion. In this paper, we introduce
DeepAgent, an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous
thinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent
reasoning process. To address the challenges of long-horizon interactions,
particularly the context length explosion from multiple tool calls and the
accumulation of interaction history, we introduce an autonomous memory folding
mechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic, working,
and tool memories, reducing error accumulation while preserving critical
information. To teach general-purpose tool use efficiently and stably, we
develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, namely ToolPO, that
leverages LLM-simulated APIs and applies tool-call advantage attribution to
assign fine-grained credit to the tool invocation tokens. Extensive experiments
on eight benchmarks, including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank,
TMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA,
HLE), demonstrate that DeepAgent consistently outperforms baselines across both
labeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios. This work takes a step
toward more general and capable agents for real-world applications. The code

Abstract: This paper presents a first empirical study of agentic AI as autonomous
decision-makers in decentralized governance. Using more than 3K proposals from
major protocols, we build an agentic AI voter that interprets proposal
contexts, retrieves historical deliberation data, and independently determines
its voting position. The agent operates within a realistic financial simulation
environment grounded in verifiable blockchain data, implemented through a
modular composable program (MCP) workflow that defines data flow and tool usage
via Agentics framework. We evaluate how closely the agent's decisions align
with the human and token-weighted outcomes, uncovering strong alignments
measured by carefully designed evaluation metrics. Our findings demonstrate
that agentic AI can augment collective decision-making by producing
interpretable, auditable, and empirically grounded signals in realistic DAO
governance settings. The study contributes to the design of explainable and
economically rigorous AI agents for decentralized financial systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恐慌发作是急性的恐惧和痛苦发作，及时适当的干预能显著帮助个体恢复稳定，但训练此类模型的合适数据集因伦理和后勤问题而稀缺。

Method: 引入PACE数据集构建高痛苦发作的第一人称叙述，基于心理急救原则训练PACER咨询模型，采用监督学习和模拟偏好对齐优化。

Conclusion: PACER在恐慌场景中始终优于通用、CBT基和GPT-4驱动的模型，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Panic attacks are acute episodes of fear and distress, in which timely,
appropriate intervention can significantly help individuals regain stability.
However, suitable datasets for training such models remain scarce due to
ethical and logistical issues. To address this, we introduce PACE, which is a
dataset that includes high-distress episodes constructed from first-person
narratives, and structured around the principles of Psychological First Aid
(PFA). Using this data, we train PACER, a counseling model designed to provide
both empathetic and directive support, which is optimized through supervised
learning and simulated preference alignment. To assess its effectiveness, we
propose PanicEval, a multi-dimensional framework covering general counseling
quality and crisis-specific strategies. Experimental results show that PACER
outperforms strong baselines in both counselor-side metrics and client affect
improvement. Human evaluations further confirm its practical value, with PACER
consistently preferred over general, CBT-based, and GPT-4-powered models in
panic scenarios (Code is available at https://github.com/JihyunLee1/PanicToCalm

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了NeuroGenPoisoning攻击框架，通过分析LLM内部神经元归因和遗传优化来生成对抗性外部知识，有效毒化RAG系统，在保持流畅性的同时实现超过90%的群体覆盖成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG攻击方法主要关注检索内容或提示结构的迭代操作，忽略了模型内部表示动态和神经元级敏感性，且未充分考虑与强参数化知识的知识冲突问题。

Method: 首先识别与上下文毒化知识强烈相关的毒化响应神经元，然后使用遗传算法进化对抗性段落以最大化激活这些神经元，并通过观察到的归因信号重用有潜力但最初不成功的外部知识变体。

Result: 在多个模型和数据集上的实验结果显示，该方法能持续实现超过90%的群体覆盖成功率，同时保持流畅性。

Conclusion: 基于毒化响应神经元的引导能有效解决知识冲突问题，该方法能够大规模生成有效的毒化RAG知识。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to
dynamically integrate external knowledge during inference, improving their
factual accuracy and adaptability. However, adversaries can inject poisoned
external knowledge to override the model's internal memory. While existing
attacks iteratively manipulate retrieval content or prompt structure of RAG,
they largely ignore the model's internal representation dynamics and
neuron-level sensitivities. The underlying mechanism of RAG poisoning has not
been fully studied and the effect of knowledge conflict with strong parametric
knowledge in RAG is not considered. In this work, we propose NeuroGenPoisoning,
a novel attack framework that generates adversarial external knowledge in RAG
guided by LLM internal neuron attribution and genetic optimization. Our method
first identifies a set of Poison-Responsive Neurons whose activation strongly
correlates with contextual poisoning knowledge. We then employ a genetic
algorithm to evolve adversarial passages that maximally activate these neurons.
Crucially, our framework enables massive-scale generation of effective poisoned
RAG knowledge by identifying and reusing promising but initially unsuccessful
external knowledge variants via observed attribution signals. At the same time,
Poison-Responsive Neurons guided poisoning can effectively resolves knowledge
conflict. Experimental results across models and datasets demonstrate
consistently achieving high Population Overwrite Success Rate (POSR) of over
90% while preserving fluency. Empirical evidence shows that our method
effectively resolves knowledge conflict.

TL;DR: EGO-Prompt是一个自动化框架，通过进化图优化方法自动设计更好的提示和推理过程，在领域特定任务中显著提升LLM性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实应用中，为LLM设计领域特定任务的最优提示和推理过程既必要又具挑战性，需要解决如何整合领域知识、提升推理效率以及为领域专家提供知识整合指导等关键问题。

Method: 提出EGO-Prompt框架，从专家构建的初始语义因果图(SCG)出发，通过因果引导的文本梯度过程分两步优化：首先生成确定性推理指导，然后让LLM适应使用该指导与原始输入。采用迭代优化算法使用文本梯度和真实标签同时精炼SCG和推理机制。

Result: 在公共卫生、交通和人类行为任务上测试，EGO-Prompt比前沿方法F1分数提高7.32%-12.61%，让小模型以不到20%的成本达到大模型性能，并输出精炼的领域特定SCG提升可解释性。

Conclusion: EGO-Prompt通过自动化优化提示和推理过程，显著提升了LLM在领域特定任务中的性能，同时降低了计算成本并增强了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Designing optimal prompts and reasoning processes for large language models
(LLMs) on domain-specific tasks is both necessary and challenging in real-world
applications. Determining how to integrate domain knowledge, enhance reasoning
efficiency, and even provide domain experts with refined knowledge integration
hints are particularly crucial yet unresolved tasks. In this research, we
propose Evolutionary Graph Optimization for Prompting (EGO-Prompt), an
automated framework to designing better prompts, efficient reasoning processes
and providing enhanced causal-informed process. EGO-Prompt begins with a
general prompt and fault-tolerant initial Semantic Causal Graph (SCG)
descriptions, constructed by human experts, which is then automatically refined
and optimized to guide LLM reasoning. Recognizing that expert-defined SCGs may
be partial or imperfect and that their optimal integration varies across LLMs,
EGO-Prompt integrates a novel causal-guided textual gradient process in two
steps: first, generating nearly deterministic reasoning guidance from the SCG
for each instance, and second, adapting the LLM to effectively utilize the
guidance alongside the original input. The iterative optimization algorithm
further refines both the SCG and the reasoning mechanism using textual
gradients with ground-truth. We tested the framework on real-world public
health, transportation and human behavior tasks. EGO-Prompt achieves
7.32%-12.61% higher F1 than cutting-edge methods, and allows small models to
reach the performence of larger models at under 20% of the original cost. It
also outputs a refined, domain-specific SCG that improves interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在需要单一确定性答案的任务上表现出色，但在概率指令跟随任务中表现不佳，存在偏见问题，影响需要非确定性行为的应用如人类行为模拟、内容多样化和多人游戏，也损害了生成响应的多样性。

Method: SSoT提示方法：首先让LLM输出随机字符串生成足够熵，然后通过操作这个字符串提取随机性来推导最终答案，在保持多样性的同时遵循特定约束。

Result: SSoT显著提高了LLM在概率指令跟随任务中的表现，接近伪随机数生成器的理想性能；在NoveltyBench上的实验表明SSoT还能增强开放任务中的响应多样性。

Conclusion: SSoT是一种简单有效的提示方法，能够改善LLM在概率指令跟随任务中的表现，并增强生成响应的多样性，适用于需要非确定性行为的各种应用场景。

Abstract: We introduce String Seed of Thought (SSoT), a novel prompting method for LLMs
that improves Probabilistic Instruction Following (PIF). We define PIF as a
task requiring an LLM to select its answer from a predefined set of options,
each associated with a specific probability, such that the empirical
distribution of the generated answers aligns with the target distribution when
prompted multiple times. While LLMs excel at tasks with single, deterministic
answers, they often fail at PIF, exhibiting biases problematic for applications
requiring non-deterministic behaviors, such as human-behavior simulation,
content diversification, and multiplayer games. It also harms the diversity of
generated responses, a crucial factor in test-time scaling, by causing the
outputs to collapse into a limited set of answers. To address this, we propose
SSoT, a simple prompting method that instructs an LLM to first output a random
string to generate sufficient entropy. SSoT also instructs the LLM to extract
randomness by manipulating this string to derive a final answer, thereby
preserving diversity while adhering to specific constraints. We demonstrate
that SSoT significantly improves the PIF performance of LLMs, approaching the
ideal performance of a pseudo-random number generator. Furthermore, our
experiments on NoveltyBench show SSoT's benefits extend beyond closed-set tasks
to open-ended tasks by enhancing response diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型在现实部署中面临分布漂移和新任务挑战，静态零样本能力不足，需要持续学习方法来适应环境变化。

Method: 使用低秩适应技术，将任务特定的权重更新约束在模型当前参数的近似零空间内，最小化对已有知识的干扰。

Result: 实验表明该框架有效保护零样本迁移能力，在持续学习基准上取得有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: NuSA-CL是现实应用中持续演化零样本视觉语言模型的实用且可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization, enabling deployment in a wide range of
real-world tasks without additional task-specific training. However, in real
deployment scenarios with evolving environments or emerging classes, these
models inevitably face distributional shifts and novel tasks. In such contexts,
static zero-shot capabilities are insufficient, and there is a growing need for
continual learning methods that allow models to adapt over time while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting. We introduce NuSA-CL (Null Space Adaptation for
Continual Learning), a lightweight memory-free continual learning framework
designed to address this challenge. NuSA-CL employs low-rank adaptation and
constrains task-specific weight updates to lie within an approximate null space
of the model's current parameters. This strategy minimizes interference with
previously acquired knowledge, effectively preserving the zero-shot
capabilities of the original model. Unlike methods relying on replay buffers or
costly distillation, NuSA-CL imposes minimal computational and memory overhead,
making it practical for deployment in resource-constrained, real-world
continual learning environments. Experiments show that our framework not only
effectively preserves zero-shot transfer capabilities but also achieves highly
competitive performance on continual learning benchmarks. These results
position NuSA-CL as a practical and scalable solution for continually evolving
zero-shot VLMs in real-world applications.

Conclusion: Shylock有效解决了多变量时间序列因果发现中的数据缺口和过拟合问题，开发了Tcausal库并部署在EarthDataMiner平台上便于使用。

Abstract: Causal relationship discovery has been drawing increasing attention due to
its prevalent application. Existing methods rely on human experience,
statistical methods, or graphical criteria methods which are error-prone, stuck
at the idealized assumption, and rely on a huge amount of data. And there is
also a serious data gap in accessing Multivariate time series(MTS) in many
areas, adding difficulty in finding their causal relationship. Existing methods
are easy to be over-fitting on them. To fill the gap we mentioned above, in
this paper, we propose Shylock, a novel method that can work well in both
few-shot and normal MTS to find the causal relationship. Shylock can reduce the
number of parameters exponentially by using group dilated convolution and a
sharing kernel, but still learn a better representation of variables with time
delay. By combing the global constraint and the local constraint, Shylock
achieves information sharing among networks to help improve the accuracy. To
evaluate the performance of Shylock, we also design a data generation method to
generate MTS with time delay. We evaluate it on commonly used benchmarks and
generated datasets. Extensive experiments show that Shylock outperforms two

Conclusion: OutboundEval为专业应用中的大语言模型基准测试建立了实用、可扩展和面向领域的标准。

Abstract: We propose OutboundEval, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large
language models (LLMs) in expert-level intelligent outbound calling scenarios.
Unlike existing methods that suffer from three key limitations - insufficient
dataset diversity and category coverage, unrealistic user simulation, and
inaccurate evaluation metrics - OutboundEval addresses these issues through a
structured framework. First, we design a benchmark spanning six major business
domains and 30 representative sub-scenarios, each with scenario-specific
process decomposition, weighted scoring, and domain-adaptive metrics. Second,
we develop a large-model-driven User Simulator that generates diverse,
persona-rich virtual users with realistic behaviors, emotional variability, and
communication styles, providing a controlled yet authentic testing environment.
Third, we introduce a dynamic evaluation method that adapts to task variations,
integrating automated and human-in-the-loop assessment to measure task
execution accuracy, professional knowledge application, adaptability, and user
experience quality. Experiments on 12 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal distinct
trade-offs between expert-level task completion and interaction fluency,
offering practical insights for building reliable, human-like outbound AI
systems. OutboundEval establishes a practical, extensible, and domain-oriented
standard for benchmarking LLMs in professional applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI自主系统能力的扩展，严格证明其安全性对于负责任采用至关重要。OOD检测能够处理系统生命周期中的新颖和不确定情况，因此在研究和安全工程社区受到关注。

Method: 通过全面综述分析，定义了相关概念，调查OOD成因，探索自主系统安全保证和OOD检测的挑战因素，识别ML开发生命周期中的可用技术。

Conclusion: 概述了跨领域自主系统安全开发和运营面临的挑战和未来工作方向。

Abstract: The operational capabilities and application domains of AI-enabled autonomous
systems have expanded significantly in recent years due to advances in robotics
and machine learning (ML). Demonstrating the safety of autonomous systems
rigorously is critical for their responsible adoption but it is challenging as
it requires robust methodologies that can handle novel and uncertain situations
throughout the system lifecycle, including detecting out-of-distribution (OoD)
data. Thus, OOD detection is receiving increased attention from the research,
development and safety engineering communities. This comprehensive review
analyses OOD detection techniques within the context of safety assurance for
autonomous systems, in particular in safety-critical domains. We begin by
defining the relevant concepts, investigating what causes OOD and exploring the
factors which make the safety assurance of autonomous systems and OOD detection
challenging. Our review identifies a range of techniques which can be used
throughout the ML development lifecycle and we suggest areas within the
lifecycle in which they may be used to support safety assurance arguments. We
discuss a number of caveats that system and safety engineers must be aware of
when integrating OOD detection into system lifecycles. We conclude by outlining
the challenges and future work necessary for the safe development and operation
of autonomous systems across a range of domains and applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自适应选择UCT探索常数λ的策略，使算法对游戏奖励尺度不敏感，推荐使用2σ作为λ值，其中σ是搜索树中所有状态-动作对Q值的经验标准差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UCT算法对游戏奖励尺度敏感，传统方法在稀疏奖励游戏中表现良好，但在具有密集奖励和手动选择奖励尺度的游戏中，Q值会跨越不同数量级，导致性能下降。

Method: 评估了文献中提出的各种λ策略以及五种新策略，包括选择λ作为搜索树中所有状态-动作对Q值经验标准差的2倍。

Result: 新提出的2σ策略在广泛任务中优于现有λ策略，无论是使用单一参数值还是优化所有可用参数获得的峰值性能。

Conclusion: 推荐使用2σ作为UCT探索常数λ，该方法对游戏奖励尺度不敏感，在各种任务中表现优异。

Abstract: The Upper Confidence Bounds For Trees (UCT) algorithm is not agnostic to the
reward scale of the game it is applied to. For zero-sum games with the sparse
rewards of $\{-1,0,1\}$ at the end of the game, this is not a problem, but many
games often feature dense rewards with hand-picked reward scales, causing a
node's Q-value to span different magnitudes across different games. In this
paper, we evaluate various strategies for adaptively choosing the UCT
exploration constant $\lambda$, called $\lambda$-strategies, that are agnostic
to the game's reward scale. These $\lambda$-strategies include those proposed
in the literature as well as five new strategies. Given our experimental
results, we recommend using one of our newly suggested $\lambda$-strategies,
which is to choose $\lambda$ as $2 \cdot \sigma$ where $\sigma$ is the
empirical standard deviation of all state-action pairs' Q-values of the search
tree. This method outperforms existing $\lambda$-strategies across a wide range
of tasks both in terms of a single parameter value and the peak performances
obtained by optimizing all available parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全缓解策略依赖注入启发式安全信号，往往会抑制推理能力，无法解决安全与推理之间的权衡问题。研究发现模型存在自我越狱现象，即模型会覆盖自身风险评估并回应不安全提示。

Method: 提出Chain-of-Guardrail训练框架，通过重组或回溯不安全的推理步骤，引导模型回到安全轨迹，同时保留有效的推理链。

Result: 在多个推理和安全基准测试中，CoG显著提升了当前大型推理模型的安全性，同时保持了相当的推理能力，明显优于先前存在严重安全-推理权衡的方法。

Conclusion: CoG框架有效解决了大型推理模型的安全风险，在保持推理能力的同时大幅提升安全性，为安全与推理的平衡提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on complex
reasoning tasks but remain vulnerable to severe safety risks, including harmful
content generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing mitigation strategies rely
on injecting heuristic safety signals during training, which often suppress
reasoning ability and fail to resolve the safety-reasoning trade-off. To
systematically investigate this issue, we analyze the reasoning trajectories of
diverse LRMs and uncover a phenomenon we term Self-Jailbreak, where models
override their own risk assessments and justify responding to unsafe prompts.
This finding reveals that LRMs inherently possess the ability to reject unsafe
queries, but this ability is compromised, resulting in harmful outputs.
Building on these insights, we propose the Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG), a training
framework that recomposes or backtracks unsafe reasoning steps, steering the
model back onto safe trajectories while preserving valid reasoning chains.
Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning and safety benchmarks
demonstrate that CoG substantially improves the safety of current LRMs while
preserving comparable reasoning ability, significantly outperforming prior
methods that suffer from severe safety-reasoning trade-offs.

Method: 对AIES和FAccT会议论文集进行范围综述，系统分析可信度在不同研究领域中的定义、操作化和应用方式，重点关注概念化方法、测量方法、验证技术、应用领域和基础价值观。

Result: 虽然在定义透明度、问责制和鲁棒性等技术属性方面取得了显著进展，但研究发现存在关键差距。当前研究往往过度强调技术精度而牺牲社会和伦理考量，AI系统的社会技术性质仍较少被探索，可信度成为由有权定义者塑造的有争议概念。

Conclusion: 结合技术严谨性与社会、文化和制度考量的跨学科方法对于推进可信AI至关重要。作者为AI伦理社区提出了采用整体框架的可操作措施，真正解决AI系统与社会之间复杂互动，最终促进惠及所有利益相关者的负责任技术发展。

Abstract: Background: Trustworthy AI serves as a foundational pillar for two major AI
ethics conferences: AIES and FAccT. However, current research often adopts
techno-centric approaches, focusing primarily on technical attributes such as
reliability, robustness, and fairness, while overlooking the sociotechnical
dimensions critical to understanding AI trustworthiness in real-world contexts.
  Objectives: This scoping review aims to examine how the AIES and FAccT
communities conceptualize, measure, and validate AI trustworthiness,
identifying major gaps and opportunities for advancing a holistic understanding
of trustworthy AI systems.
  Methods: We conduct a scoping review of AIES and FAccT conference proceedings
to date, systematically analyzing how trustworthiness is defined,
operationalized, and applied across different research domains. Our analysis
focuses on conceptualization approaches, measurement methods, verification and
validation techniques, application areas, and underlying values.
  Results: While significant progress has been made in defining technical
attributes such as transparency, accountability, and robustness, our findings
reveal critical gaps. Current research often predominantly emphasizes technical
precision at the expense of social and ethical considerations. The
sociotechnical nature of AI systems remains less explored and trustworthiness
emerges as a contested concept shaped by those with the power to define it.
  Conclusions: An interdisciplinary approach combining technical rigor with
social, cultural, and institutional considerations is essential for advancing
trustworthy AI. We propose actionable measures for the AI ethics community to
adopt holistic frameworks that genuinely address the complex interplay between
AI systems and society, ultimately promoting responsible technological
development that benefits all stakeholders.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的代码即策略方法在动态或部分可观测环境中存在环境基础不足的问题，导致代码生成不完整或不正确，影响任务成功率。

Method: 采用神经符号框架，在代码生成过程中加入显式符号验证和交互验证阶段，生成探索性代码主动与环境交互获取缺失观测，同时保持任务相关状态。

Result: 在RLBench和真实世界动态、部分可观测场景中，任务成功率比代码即策略基线提升46.2%，任务相关动作可执行性达到86.8%以上。

Conclusion: 该框架通过增强代码生成的环境基础，显著提高了动态环境中任务规划的可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the automatic
generation of executable code for task planning and control in embodied agents
such as robots, demonstrating the potential of LLM-based embodied intelligence.
However, these LLM-based code-as-policies approaches often suffer from limited
environmental grounding, particularly in dynamic or partially observable
settings, leading to suboptimal task success rates due to incorrect or
incomplete code generation. In this work, we propose a neuro-symbolic embodied
task planning framework that incorporates explicit symbolic verification and
interactive validation processes during code generation. In the validation
phase, the framework generates exploratory code that actively interacts with
the environment to acquire missing observations while preserving task-relevant
states. This integrated process enhances the grounding of generated code,
resulting in improved task reliability and success rates in complex
environments. We evaluate our framework on RLBench and in real-world settings
across dynamic, partially observable scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate that our framework improves task success rates by 46.2% over
Code-as-Policies baselines and attains over 86.8% executability of
task-relevant actions, thereby enhancing the reliability of task planning in
dynamic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CXR分析模型难以适应新的诊断任务和复杂推理场景，现有代理通常依赖单一诊断流程且缺乏工具可靠性评估机制，限制了适应性和可信度。

Method: 采用导演编排的三阶段方法：工具调用（包含证据驱动验证器）、诊断规划（组建专家团队）、协作决策（整合专家见解和上下文记忆）。

Result: 在各种CXR解读任务上的实验表明，CXRAgent表现出强大性能，能提供视觉证据，并能很好地泛化到不同复杂度的临床任务。

Conclusion: CXRAgent通过多阶段协作和证据验证机制，显著提升了CXR解读的适应性、可靠性和诊断能力。

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) plays a pivotal role in clinical diagnosis, and a variety
of task-specific and foundation models have been developed for automatic CXR
interpretation. However, these models often struggle to adapt to new diagnostic
tasks and complex reasoning scenarios. Recently, LLM-based agent models have
emerged as a promising paradigm for CXR analysis, enhancing model's capability
through tool coordination, multi-step reasoning, and team collaboration, etc.
However, existing agents often rely on a single diagnostic pipeline and lack
mechanisms for assessing tools' reliability, limiting their adaptability and
credibility. To this end, we propose CXRAgent, a director-orchestrated,
multi-stage agent for CXR interpretation, where a central director coordinates
the following stages: (1) Tool Invocation: The agent strategically orchestrates
a set of CXR-analysis tools, with outputs normalized and verified by the
Evidence-driven Validator (EDV), which grounds diagnostic outputs with visual
evidence to support reliable downstream diagnosis; (2) Diagnostic Planning:
Guided by task requirements and intermediate findings, the agent formulates a
targeted diagnostic plan. It then assembles an expert team accordingly,
defining member roles and coordinating their interactions to enable adaptive
and collaborative reasoning; (3) Collaborative Decision-making: The agent
integrates insights from the expert team with accumulated contextual memories,
synthesizing them into an evidence-backed diagnostic conclusion. Experiments on
various CXR interpretation tasks show that CXRAgent delivers strong
performance, providing visual evidence and generalizes well to clinical tasks
of different complexity. Code and data are valuable at this

*Lufan Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Magellan框架通过蒙特卡洛树搜索和分层引导系统，解决了LLM在创意生成中倾向于保守、缺乏真正创新的问题，显著提升了科学创意的合理性和创新性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在创意生成时往往陷入训练数据的"引力井"，产生高概率但缺乏创新的想法。基于搜索的方法如ToT依赖不可靠的自我评估启发式方法，存在根本性限制。

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛树搜索(MCTS)和分层引导系统：语义罗盘向量通过正交投影进行长程方向引导；景观感知价值函数替代有缺陷的自我评估，平衡内在连贯性、外在新颖性和叙事进展。

Result: 广泛实验表明，Magellan在生成科学创意方面显著优于ReAct和ToT等强基线，在合理性和创新性方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 对于创意发现，有原则的引导搜索比无约束的自主性更有效，为LLM成为创新合作伙伴铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with generating truly innovative
ideas, typically defaulting to high-probability, familiar concepts within their
training data's "gravity wells." While advanced search-based methods like Tree
of Thoughts (ToT) attempt to mitigate this, they are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on unprincipled, inconsistent self-evaluation heuristics to
guide exploration. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{Magellan}, a novel
framework that reframes creative generation as a principled, guided exploration
of an LLM's latent conceptual space. At its core, Magellan employs Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) governed by a hierarchical guidance system. For long-range
direction, a "semantic compass" vector, formulated via orthogonal projection,
steers the search towards relevant novelty. For local, step-by-step decisions,
a landscape-aware value function replaces flawed self-evaluation with an
explicit reward structure that balances intrinsic coherence, extrinsic novelty,
and narrative progress. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Magellan
significantly outperforms strong baselines, including ReAct and ToT, in
generating scientific ideas with superior plausibility and innovation. Our work
shows that for creative discovery, a principled, guided search is more
effective than unconstrained agency, paving the way for LLMs to become more
capable partners in innovation.

TL;DR: 提出一个结合强化学习(RL)的框架，用于提高1.5B模型在数学推理中的性能和token效率，相比仅使用监督微调(SFT)的方法，在GSM8K数据集上实现了更高准确率和超过40%的token使用减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预算强制方法虽然能通过分配额外计算预算来提升推理性能，但依赖于长上下文推理轨迹的监督微调，这会导致较小模型因冗长响应而性能下降。

Method: 整合强化学习到框架中，仅使用1.5K训练样本，结合SFT+RL训练1.5B模型，提高token效率并提升数学推理性能。

Result: 在GSM8K数据集上，SFT+RL模型在不同计算预算下表现更好，总体准确率更高，同时token使用量相比SFT模型减少了40%以上。

Conclusion: 强化学习能够恢复因长上下文训练造成的损失，整体提升数学推理性能，证明了RL在提高小模型效率和性能方面的有效性。

Abstract: Test-time scaling methods have seen a rapid increase in popularity for its
computational efficiency and parameter-independent training to improve
reasoning performance on Large Language Models. One such method is called
budget forcing, a decoding intervention strategy which allocates extra compute
budget for thinking and elicits the inherent self-correcting behavior of the
model. However, this relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long-context
reasoning traces which causes performance degradation on smaller models due to
verbose responses. For this reason, we offer a framework integrating
reinforcement learning (RL) to improve token efficiency and boost the
performance of a 1.5B model for mathematical reasoning. We demonstrate this
using only 1.5K training samples and found that our SFT+RL model performed
better on the GSM8K dataset with varying compute budgets. Our main findings
showed an overall higher accuracy while significantly reducing its token usage
by over 40% compared to the SFT model, revealing how RL can recover the losses
due to long-context training and altogether improving performance in
mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated highly effective learning, human-like response
generation,and decision-making capabilities in high-risk sectors. However,
these models remain black boxes because they struggle to ensure transparency in
responses. The literature has explored numerous approaches to address
transparency challenges in LLMs, including Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy AI). NeSy AI
approaches were primarily developed for conventional neural networks and are
not well-suited to the unique features of LLMs. Consequently, there is a
limited systematic understanding of how symbolic AI can be effectively
integrated into LLMs. This paper aims to address this gap by first reviewing
established NeSy AI methods and then proposing a novel taxonomy of symbolic
integration in LLMs, along with a roadmap to merge symbolic techniques with
LLMs. The roadmap introduces a new categorisation framework across four
dimensions by organising existing literature within these categories. These
include symbolic integration across various stages of LLM, coupling mechanisms,
architectural paradigms, as well as algorithmic and application-level
perspectives. The paper thoroughly identifies current benchmarks, cutting-edge
advancements, and critical gaps within the field to propose a roadmap for
future research. By highlighting the latest developments and notable gaps in
the literature, it offers practical insights for implementing frameworks for
symbolic integration into LLMs to enhance transparency.

Method: AutoOpt框架包含三个模块：M1使用深度学习模型从图像生成LaTeX代码；M2使用微调的小型LLM将LaTeX转换为PYOMO脚本；M3使用双层优化分解方法求解优化问题。

Result: MER任务的深度学习模型在BLEU得分上优于ChatGPT、Gemini和Nougat；BOBD方法在复杂测试问题上比内点算法和遗传算法表现更好。

Conclusion: AutoOpt-11k数据集和AutoOpt框架为数学优化问题的自动化求解提供了有效工具，显著降低了使用门槛并提高了求解效率。

Abstract: This study presents AutoOpt-11k, a unique image dataset of over 11,000
handwritten and printed mathematical optimization models corresponding to
single-objective, multi-objective, multi-level, and stochastic optimization
problems exhibiting various types of complexities such as non-linearity,
non-convexity, non-differentiability, discontinuity, and high-dimensionality.
The labels consist of the LaTeX representation for all the images and modeling
language representation for a subset of images. The dataset is created by 25
experts following ethical data creation guidelines and verified in two-phases
to avoid errors. Further, we develop AutoOpt framework, a machine learning
based automated approach for solving optimization problems, where the user just
needs to provide an image of the formulation and AutoOpt solves it efficiently
without any further human intervention. AutoOpt framework consists of three
Modules: (i) M1 (Image_to_Text)- a deep learning model performs the
Mathematical Expression Recognition (MER) task to generate the LaTeX code
corresponding to the optimization formulation in image; (ii) M2 (Text_to_Text)-
a small-scale fine-tuned LLM generates the PYOMO script (optimization modeling
language) from LaTeX code; (iii) M3 (Optimization)- a Bilevel Optimization
based Decomposition (BOBD) method solves the optimization formulation described
in the PYOMO script. We use AutoOpt-11k dataset for training and testing of
deep learning models employed in AutoOpt. The deep learning model for MER task
(M1) outperforms ChatGPT, Gemini and Nougat on BLEU score metric. BOBD method
(M3), which is a hybrid approach, yields better results on complex test
problems compared to common approaches, like interior-point algorithm and
genetic algorithm.

Motivation: 现有多任务车辆路径问题(VRP)的神经方法通常学习统一求解器来同时处理多个约束，但未能充分利用VRP变体的组合结构，错过了基础求解器的潜在优势。

Method: 提出状态可分解MDP(SDMDP)将VRP状态空间表示为基础状态空间的笛卡尔积，并开发潜在空间扩展，通过最优基础策略和可学习混合函数在潜在空间中实现策略重用。

Conclusion: 该框架通过感知VRP变体间的共享组件性质并主动重用基础求解器，有效克服了统一求解器的局限性，同时避免了训练神经求解器的指数增长。

Abstract: Existing neural methods for multi-task vehicle routing problems (VRPs)
typically learn unified solvers to handle multiple constraints simultaneously.
However, they often underutilize the compositional structure of VRP variants,
each derivable from a common set of basis VRP variants. This critical oversight
causes unified solvers to miss out the potential benefits of basis solvers,
each specialized for a basis VRP variant. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a framework that enables unified solvers to perceive the
shared-component nature across VRP variants by proactively reusing basis
solvers, while mitigating the exponential growth of trained neural solvers.
Specifically, we introduce a State-Decomposable MDP (SDMDP) that reformulates
VRPs by expressing the state space as the Cartesian product of basis state
spaces associated with basis VRP variants. More crucially, this formulation
inherently yields the optimal basis policy for each basis VRP variant.
Furthermore, a Latent Space-based SDMDP extension is developed by incorporating
both the optimal basis policies and a learnable mixture function to enable the
policy reuse in the latent space. Under mild assumptions, this extension
provably recovers the optimal unified policy of SDMDP through the mixture
function that computes the state embedding as a mapping from the basis state
embeddings generated by optimal basis policies. For practical implementation,
we introduce the Mixture-of-Specialized-Experts Solver (MoSES), which realizes
basis policies through specialized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) experts, and
implements the mixture function via an adaptive gating mechanism. Extensive
experiments conducted across VRP variants showcase the superiority of MoSES
over prior methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in various
contexts by providing tools at their disposal. However, LLM agents can exhibit
unpredictable behaviors, including taking undesirable and/or unsafe actions. In
order to measure the latent propensity of LLM agents for taking illegal actions
under an EU legislative context, we introduce EU-Agent-Bench, a verifiable
human-curated benchmark that evaluates an agent's alignment with EU legal norms
in situations where benign user inputs could lead to unlawful actions. Our
benchmark spans scenarios across several categories, including data protection,
bias/discrimination, and scientific integrity, with each user request allowing
for both compliant and non-compliant execution of the requested actions.
Comparing the model's function calls against a rubric exhaustively supported by
citations of the relevant legislature, we evaluate the legal compliance of
frontier LLMs, and furthermore investigate the compliance effect of providing
the relevant legislative excerpts in the agent's system prompt along with
explicit instructions to comply. We release a public preview set for the
research community, while holding out a private test set to prevent data
contamination in evaluating upcoming models. We encourage future work extending
agentic safety benchmarks to different legal jurisdictions and to multi-turn
and multilingual interactions. We release our code on

### [256] [Co-Sight: Enhancing LLM-Based Agents via Conflict-Aware Meta-Verification and Trustworthy Reasoning with Structured Facts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21557)
*Hongwei Zhang,Ji Lu,Shiqing Jiang,Chenxiang Zhu,Li Xie,Chen Zhong,Haoran Chen,Yurui Zhu,Yongsheng Du,Yanqin Gao,Lingjun Huang,Baoli Wang,Fang Tan,Peng Zou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Co-Sight通过冲突感知元验证和可信推理结构化事实机制，将推理转化为可证伪和可审计的过程，解决了LLM智能体长程推理中验证不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体在长程推理中失败往往不是因为生成能力弱，而是因为对中间推理过程的验证不足。

Method: 采用两个互补机制：冲突感知元验证（CAMV）将验证重新定义为冲突识别和针对性证伪，只对专家智能体之间的分歧热点分配计算资源；可信推理结构化事实（TRSF）通过结构化事实模块持续组织、验证和同步证据。

Result: 在GAIA上达到84.4%的准确率，在Humanity's Last Exam上达到35.5%，在Chinese-SimpleQA上达到93.8%，均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: Co-Sight为LLM智能体提供了可扩展的可靠长程推理范式，结构化事实基础和冲突感知验证的协同作用是改进的关键。

Abstract: Long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents often fails not from generative
weakness but from insufficient verification of intermediate reasoning. Co-Sight
addresses this challenge by turning reasoning into a falsifiable and auditable
process through two complementary mechanisms: Conflict-Aware Meta-Verification
(CAMV) and Trustworthy Reasoning with Structured Facts (TRSF). CAMV
reformulates verification as conflict identification and targeted
falsification, allocating computation only to disagreement hotspots among
expert agents rather than to full reasoning chains. This bounds verification
cost to the number of inconsistencies and improves efficiency and reliability.
TRSF continuously organizes, validates, and synchronizes evidence across agents
through a structured facts module. By maintaining verified, traceable, and
auditable knowledge, it ensures that all reasoning is grounded in consistent,
source-verified information and supports transparent verification throughout
the reasoning process. Together, TRSF and CAMV form a closed verification loop,
where TRSF supplies structured facts and CAMV selectively falsifies or
reinforces them, yielding transparent and trustworthy reasoning. Empirically,
Co-Sight achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on GAIA (84.4%) and Humanity's Last
Exam (35.5%), and strong results on Chinese-SimpleQA (93.8%). Ablation studies
confirm that the synergy between structured factual grounding and
conflict-aware verification drives these improvements. Co-Sight thus offers a
scalable paradigm for reliable long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents. Code

### [257] [Learning Neural Control Barrier Functions from Expert Demonstrations using Inverse Constraint Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21560)
*Yuxuan Yang,Hussein Sibai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种使用模仿学习训练神经控制屏障函数的方法，无需明确指定失败状态集合，仅通过专家演示数据就能学习安全约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在关键领域运行的自主系统中，安全是基本要求。传统方法需要明确指定失败状态集合，但在许多实际场景中（如自动驾驶中的跟车问题），失败状态难以形式化定义，而专家演示数据更容易获取。

Method: 使用模仿学习训练约束函数来分类系统状态为安全或不安全，然后用该函数标注模拟轨迹数据来训练神经控制屏障函数。

Result: 在四个不同环境中进行实证评估，该方法优于现有基线方法，且与使用真实安全标签训练的神经控制屏障函数性能相当。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种数据驱动的方式学习安全约束，无需明确指定失败状态集合，在安全关键系统中具有实用价值。

Abstract: Safety is a fundamental requirement for autonomous systems operating in
critical domains. Control barrier functions (CBFs) have been used to design
safety filters that minimally alter nominal controls for such systems to
maintain their safety. Learning neural CBFs has been proposed as a data-driven
alternative for their computationally expensive optimization-based synthesis.
However, it is often the case that the failure set of states that should be
avoided is non-obvious or hard to specify formally, e.g., tailgating in
autonomous driving, while a set of expert demonstrations that achieve the task
and avoid the failure set is easier to generate. We use ICL to train a
constraint function that classifies the states of the system under
consideration to safe, i.e., belong to a controlled forward invariant set that
is disjoint from the unspecified failure set, and unsafe ones, i.e., belong to
the complement of that set. We then use that function to label a new set of
simulated trajectories to train our neural CBF. We empirically evaluate our
approach in four different environments, demonstrating that it outperforms
existing baselines and achieves comparable performance to a neural CBF trained
with the same data but annotated with ground-truth safety labels.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了Huxley-Gödel Machine (HGM)，一种通过估计和利用自我改进潜力指标(CMP)来指导代码代理自我改进的方法，在多个基准测试中超越了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通过代码代理编辑自身代码库实现自我改进，但发现代理的自我改进潜力(元生产力)与其编码基准性能之间存在不匹配问题。

Method: 提出CMP指标来评估代理的自我改进潜力，并基于此构建Huxley-Gödel Machine (HGM)，通过估计CMP来指导自我修改树的搜索。

Result: 在SWE-bench Verified和Polyglot基准测试中，HGM优于先前的自我改进代码代理开发方法，同时使用更少的实际时间。优化后的代理在SWE-bench Lite上达到人类水平性能。

Conclusion: HGM方法通过有效评估和利用自我改进潜力，显著提升了代码代理的自我改进效率和性能，并展示了良好的迁移能力。

Abstract: Recent studies operationalize self-improvement through coding agents that
edit their own codebases. They grow a tree of self-modifications through
expansion strategies that favor higher software engineering benchmark
performance, assuming that this implies more promising subsequent
self-modifications. However, we identify a mismatch between the agent's
self-improvement potential (metaproductivity) and its coding benchmark
performance, namely the Metaproductivity-Performance Mismatch. Inspired by
Huxley's concept of clade, we propose a metric ($\mathrm{CMP}$) that aggregates
the benchmark performances of the descendants of an agent as an indicator of
its potential for self-improvement. We show that, in our self-improving coding
agent development setting, access to the true $\mathrm{CMP}$ is sufficient to
simulate how the G\"odel Machine would behave under certain assumptions. We
introduce the Huxley-G\"odel Machine (HGM), which, by estimating $\mathrm{CMP}$
and using it as guidance, searches the tree of self-modifications. On SWE-bench
Verified and Polyglot, HGM outperforms prior self-improving coding agent
development methods while using less wall-clock time. Last but not least, HGM
demonstrates strong transfer to other coding datasets and large language
models. The agent optimized by HGM on SWE-bench Verified with GPT-5-mini and
evaluated on SWE-bench Lite with GPT-5 achieves human-level performance,
matching the best officially checked results of human-engineered coding agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了AstaBench基准套件，用于更严格地评估AI科学代理的能力，包含2400多个科学发现过程的问题，并提供可复现的工具环境和基线代理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI代理评估基准存在不足：缺乏真实科学研究的整体衡量、缺少可复现的工具、未考虑成本等混杂变量、缺乏标准化接口和全面基线代理。

Method: 定义基准原则和工具，开发AstaBench套件，包含科学发现全过程的问题、生产级搜索工具环境，以及9类科学优化代理和多个基线。

Result: 评估57个代理和22个代理类别，发现AI在科学研究的某些方面有进展，但距离真正解决科学辅助挑战还很远。

Conclusion: 需要更严格的基准来评估AI科学代理，AstaBench提供了这样的框架，但AI在科学辅助方面仍有很大提升空间。

Abstract: AI agents hold the potential to revolutionize scientific productivity by
automating literature reviews, replicating experiments, analyzing data, and
even proposing new directions of inquiry; indeed, there are now many such
agents, ranging from general-purpose "deep research" systems to specialized
science-specific agents, such as AI Scientist and AIGS. Rigorous evaluation of
these agents is critical for progress. Yet existing benchmarks fall short on
several fronts: they (1) fail to provide holistic, product-informed measures of
real-world use cases such as science research; (2) lack reproducible agent
tools necessary for a controlled comparison of core agentic capabilities; (3)
do not account for confounding variables such as model cost and tool access;
(4) do not provide standardized interfaces for quick agent prototyping and
evaluation; and (5) lack comprehensive baseline agents necessary to identify
true advances. In response, we define principles and tooling for more
rigorously benchmarking agents. Using these, we present AstaBench, a suite that
provides the first holistic measure of agentic ability to perform scientific
research, comprising 2400+ problems spanning the entire scientific discovery
process and multiple scientific domains, and including many problems inspired
by actual user requests to deployed Asta agents. Our suite comes with the first
scientific research environment with production-grade search tools that enable
controlled, reproducible evaluation, better accounting for confounders.
Alongside, we provide a comprehensive suite of nine science-optimized classes
of Asta agents and numerous baselines. Our extensive evaluation of 57 agents
across 22 agent classes reveals several interesting findings, most importantly
that despite meaningful progress on certain individual aspects, AI remains far
from solving the challenge of science research assistance.

### [260] [CMOMgen: Complex Multi-Ontology Alignment via Pattern-Guided In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21656)
*Marta Contreiras Silva,Daniel Faria,Catia Pesquita*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CMOMgen是首个端到端的复杂多本体匹配策略，通过检索增强生成技术选择相关类别并过滤参考映射作为示例，在三个生物医学任务中表现出色，F1分数最低63%，优于所有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的简单成对本体匹配无法提供相关但分离的本体之间的完整语义集成，需要复杂多本体匹配来建立更细致的等价关系和本体层次结构中的来源信息。

Method: 使用检索增强生成技术选择相关类别组成映射，并过滤匹配参考映射作为示例来增强上下文学习，无需对目标本体或实体数量设置限制。

Result: 在三个生物医学任务中，CMOMgen在类别选择方面优于基线方法，F1分数最低达到63%，在两个任务中优于所有基线和消融版本，在第三个任务中排名第二。手动评估显示46%的非参考映射获得最高分。

Conclusion: CMOMgen能够生成完整且语义合理的映射，证明了其构建语义合理映射的能力，为复杂多本体匹配提供了有效的端到端解决方案。

Abstract: Constructing comprehensive knowledge graphs requires the use of multiple
ontologies in order to fully contextualize data into a domain. Ontology
matching finds equivalences between concepts interconnecting ontologies and
creating a cohesive semantic layer. While the simple pairwise state of the art
is well established, simple equivalence mappings cannot provide full semantic
integration of related but disjoint ontologies. Complex multi-ontology matching
(CMOM) aligns one source entity to composite logical expressions of multiple
target entities, establishing more nuanced equivalences and provenance along
the ontological hierarchy.
  We present CMOMgen, the first end-to-end CMOM strategy that generates
complete and semantically sound mappings, without establishing any restrictions
on the number of target ontologies or entities. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
selects relevant classes to compose the mapping and filters matching reference
mappings to serve as examples, enhancing In-Context Learning. The strategy was
evaluated in three biomedical tasks with partial reference alignments. CMOMgen
outperforms baselines in class selection, demonstrating the impact of having a
dedicated strategy. Our strategy also achieves a minimum of 63% in F1-score,
outperforming all baselines and ablated versions in two out of three tasks and
placing second in the third. Furthermore, a manual evaluation of non-reference
mappings showed that 46% of the mappings achieve the maximum score, further
substantiating its ability to construct semantically sound mappings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于评估视觉语言模型的多模态框架分析基准数据集，包含专家标注的Facebook和YouTube视频广告，涵盖13种框架类型、50多家公司和20个国家。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业公关活动存在言行不一的问题（如石油公司的"漂绿"行为），需要大规模理解框架及其变化来分析公关活动的目标和性质。

Method: 构建专家标注的视频广告数据集，专门用于视觉语言模型评估，区别于以往的纯文本框架数据集。

Result: 基线实验显示GPT-4.1能检测环境信息达到79% F1分数，但最佳模型在识别绿色创新框架方面仅达到46% F1分数。

Conclusion: 该数据集有助于能源部门战略沟通的多模态分析研究，同时指出了视觉语言模型需要解决的挑战，如隐含框架、不同长度视频处理和隐含文化背景。

Abstract: Companies spend large amounts of money on public relations campaigns to
project a positive brand image. However, sometimes there is a mismatch between
what they say and what they do. Oil & gas companies, for example, are accused
of "greenwashing" with imagery of climate-friendly initiatives. Understanding
the framing, and changes in framing, at scale can help better understand the
goals and nature of public relations campaigns. To address this, we introduce a
benchmark dataset of expert-annotated video ads obtained from Facebook and
YouTube. The dataset provides annotations for 13 framing types for more than 50
companies or advocacy groups across 20 countries. Our dataset is especially
designed for the evaluation of vision-language models (VLMs), distinguishing it
from past text-only framing datasets. Baseline experiments show some promising
results, while leaving room for improvement for future work: GPT-4.1 can detect
environmental messages with 79% F1 score, while our best model only achieves
46% F1 score on identifying framing around green innovation. We also identify
challenges that VLMs must address, such as implicit framing, handling videos of
various lengths, or implicit cultural backgrounds. Our dataset contributes to
research in multimodal analysis of strategic communication in the energy
sector.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于知识图谱的框架，作为智能翻译层来解决自主代理在动态环境中的协调问题，将高层任务目标与低层规划器输入解耦。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自主代理在动态环境中协调时，高层任务目标与低层规划器输入之间的语义鸿沟问题。

Method: 采用双平面架构的知识图谱，将声明性事实编译为每个代理的任务感知"世界观"和物理感知遍历规则，使任务语义与领域无关的规划器解耦。

Result: 在墨西哥湾的自主水下航行器案例研究中，可视化展示了端到端过程，并定量证明不同的声明性策略能产生不同的高性能结果。

Conclusion: 知识图谱不仅是数据存储库，更是创建自适应和可解释自主系统的强大、有状态编排器。

Abstract: The coordination of autonomous agents in dynamic environments is hampered by
the semantic gap between high-level mission objectives and low-level planner
inputs. To address this, we introduce a framework centered on a Knowledge Graph
(KG) that functions as an intelligent translation layer. The KG's two-plane
architecture compiles declarative facts into per-agent, mission-aware
``worldviews" and physics-aware traversal rules, decoupling mission semantics
from a domain-agnostic planner. This allows complex, coordinated paths to be
modified simply by changing facts in the KG. A case study involving Autonomous
Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) in the Gulf of Mexico visually demonstrates the
end-to-end process and quantitatively proves that different declarative
policies produce distinct, high-performing outcomes. This work establishes the
KG not merely as a data repository, but as a powerful, stateful orchestrator
for creating adaptive and explainable autonomous systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法无法满足智能体架构的评估需求，因为智能体具有复合架构、自主非确定性行为和持续演化等独特特性。

Method: 开发了AgentArcEval评估方法和智能体特定通用场景目录，通过真实世界税务助手Luna的案例研究验证其有效性。

Result: 成功展示了AgentArcEval方法和场景目录在评估真实世界智能体架构方面的实用性。

Conclusion: AgentArcEval为基于基础模型的智能体架构评估提供了专门的方法论支持，能够有效应对智能体的复杂特性。

Abstract: The emergence of foundation models (FMs) has enabled the development of
highly capable and autonomous agents, unlocking new application opportunities
across a wide range of domains. Evaluating the architecture of agents is
particularly important as the architectural decisions significantly impact the
quality attributes of agents given their unique characteristics, including
compound architecture, autonomous and non-deterministic behaviour, and
continuous evolution. However, these traditional methods fall short in
addressing the evaluation needs of agent architecture due to the unique
characteristics of these agents. Therefore, in this paper, we present
AgentArcEval, a novel agent architecture evaluation method designed specially
to address the complexities of FM-based agent architecture and its evaluation.
Moreover, we present a catalogue of agent-specific general scenarios, which
serves as a guide for generating concrete scenarios to design and evaluate the
agent architecture. We demonstrate the usefulness of AgentArcEval and the
catalogue through a case study on the architecture evaluation of a real-world
tax copilot, named Luna.

TL;DR: BDiff是一种基于文本的代码差异分析算法，能够识别块级和行级的编辑操作，相比现有工具能生成更高质量的差异结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码差异分析工具在处理跨多行的块级编辑操作时存在局限，将这些操作表示为离散的行级编辑序列，导致开发人员需要手动关联这些操作，严重影响变更理解的效率。

Method: 基于传统差异分析算法，首先构建包含所有可能行映射和块映射的候选集，然后使用Kuhn-Munkres算法计算最优映射集，以最小化编辑脚本大小并贴近开发者原始意图。

Result: 实验结果表明，BDiff在保持竞争性运行时间的同时，比基线工具（包括大型语言模型）产生更高质量的差异分析结果。LLM在代码差异分析任务中在结果质量和运行效率方面都不可靠。

Conclusion: BDiff通过识别块级编辑操作有效解决了现有工具的局限性，提供了更高质量的代码差异分析结果，并开发了基于Web的可视化差异分析工具。

Abstract: Code differencing is a fundamental technique in software engineering practice
and research. While researchers have proposed text-based differencing
techniques capable of identifying line changes over the past decade, existing
methods exhibit a notable limitation in identifying edit actions (EAs) that
operate on text blocks spanning multiple lines. Such EAs are common in
developers' practice, such as moving a code block for conditional branching or
duplicating a method definition block for overloading. Existing tools represent
such block-level operations as discrete sequences of line-level EAs, compelling
developers to manually correlate them and thereby substantially impeding the
efficiency of change comprehension. To address this issue, we propose BDiff, a
text-based differencing algorithm capable of identifying two types of
block-level EAs and five types of line-level EAs. Building on traditional
differencing algorithms, we first construct a candidate set containing all
possible line mappings and block mappings. Leveraging the Kuhn-Munkres
algorithm, we then compute the optimal mapping set that can minimize the size
of the edit script (ES) while closely aligning with the original developer's
intent. To validate the effectiveness of BDiff, we selected five
state-of-the-art tools, including large language models (LLMs), as baselines
and adopted a combined qualitative and quantitative approach to evaluate their
performance in terms of ES size, result quality, and running time. Experimental
results show that BDiff produces higher-quality differencing results than
baseline tools while maintaining competitive runtime performance. Our
experiments also show the unreliability of LLMs in code differencing tasks
regarding result quality and their infeasibility in terms of runtime
efficiency. We have implemented a web-based visual differencing tool.

TL;DR: R2ComSync是一个基于检索和重排的代码-注释同步方法，通过集成混合检索和多轮重排策略，利用大语言模型实现高质量的代码注释同步。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的代码-注释同步方法存在泛化能力不足或需要大量特定任务学习资源的问题，而大语言模型在直接应用时也表现不佳，缺乏有效的上下文学习演示和正确候选优先排序机制。

Method: 提出R2ComSync方法，包含两个创新点：1）集成混合检索，同时考虑代码-注释语义和变更模式的相似性；2）多轮重排策略，通过分析大规模样本得出三个重要规则来优先选择正确候选。

Result: 在三个CCS数据集上的实验表明，R2ComSync在Java和Python编程语言上均优于五种最先进方法，生成的注释质量显著更高。

Conclusion: R2ComSync通过检索增强的上下文学习和多轮重排策略，有效解决了大语言模型在代码-注释同步任务中的局限性，实现了卓越的性能。

Abstract: Code-Comment Synchronization (CCS) aims to synchronize the comments with code
changes in an automated fashion, thereby significantly reducing the workload of
developers during software maintenance and evolution. While previous studies
have proposed various solutions that have shown success, they often exhibit
limitations, such as a lack of generalization ability or the need for extensive
task-specific learning resources. This motivates us to investigate the
potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this area. However, a pilot
analysis proves that LLMs fall short of State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) CCS approaches
because (1) they lack instructive demonstrations for In-Context Learning (ICL)
and (2) many correct-prone candidates are not prioritized.To tackle the above
challenges, we propose R2ComSync, an ICL-based code-Comment Synchronization
approach enhanced with Retrieval and Re-ranking. Specifically, R2ComSync
carries corresponding two novelties: (1) Ensemble hybrid retrieval. It equally
considers the similarity in both code-comment semantics and change patterns
when retrieval, thereby creating ICL prompts with effective examples. (2)
Multi-turn re-ranking strategy. We derived three significant rules through
large-scale CCS sample analysis. Given the inference results of LLMs, it
progressively exploits three re-ranking rules to prioritize relatively
correct-prone candidates. We evaluate R2ComSync using five recent LLMs on three
CCS datasets covering both Java and Python programming languages, and make
comparisons with five SOTA approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superior performance of R2ComSync against other approaches. Moreover, both
quantitative and qualitative analyses provide compelling evidence that the
comments synchronized by our proposal exhibit significantly higher quality.}

Motivation: 传统内存分配器配置复杂且难以优化，需要自动化方法来平衡堆使用率和运行时效率。

Method: 使用NSGA II遗传算法和rand_malloc代理工具，从执行轨迹中高效探索分配器参数，并将最佳配置转移到gem5系统模拟器进行验证。

Result: 在多种工作负载下，平均堆使用量最多减少4.1%，同时运行时效率没有损失，反而有0.25%的提升。

Conclusion: GreenMalloc框架能够有效优化内存分配器配置，在减少堆使用的同时保持或提升运行时性能。

Abstract: We present GreenMalloc, a multi objective search-based framework for
automatically configuring memory allocators. Our approach uses NSGA II and
rand_malloc as a lightweight proxy benchmarking tool. We efficiently explore
allocator parameters from execution traces and transfer the best configurations
to gem5, a large system simulator, in a case study on two allocators: the GNU
C/CPP compiler's glibc malloc and Google's TCMalloc. Across diverse workloads,
our empirical results show up to 4.1 percantage reduction in average heap usage
without loss of runtime efficiency; indeed, we get a 0.25 percantage reduction.

Abstract: GenAI-based coding assistants have disrupted software development. Their next
generation is agent-based, operating with more autonomy and potentially without
human oversight. One challenge is to provide AI agents with sufficient context
about the software projects they operate in. Like humans, AI agents require
contextual information to develop solutions that are in line with the target
architecture, interface specifications, coding guidelines, standard workflows,
and other project-specific policies. Popular AI agents for software development
(e.g., Claude Code) advocate for maintaining tool-specific version-controlled
Markdown files that cover aspects such as the project structure, building and
testing, or code style. The content of these files is automatically added to
each prompt. AGENTS.md has emerged as a potential standard that consolidates
tool-specific formats. However, little is known about whether and how
developers adopt this format. Therefore, in this paper, we present the results
of a preliminary study investigating the adoption of AI configuration files in
466 open-source software projects, what information developers provide in these
files, how they present that information, and how they evolve over time. Our
findings indicate that there is no established structure yet, and that there is
a lot of variation in terms of how context is provided (descriptive,
prescriptive, prohibitive, explanatory, conditional). We see great potential in
studying which modifications in structure or presentation can positively affect
the quality of the generated content. Finally, our analysis of commits that
have modified AGENTS.md files provides first insights into how projects
continuously extend and maintain these files. We conclude the paper by
outlining how the adoption of AI configuration files in provides a unique
opportunity to study real-world prompt and context engineering.

Result: LLMs的平均F1得分仅比SLMs高2%，但差异不具统计显著性。SLMs在所有数据集上几乎达到LLMs的性能，在PROMISE Reclass数据集上甚至在召回率方面优于LLMs。数据集特性比模型大小对性能影响更大。

Conclusion: SLMs是需求分类任务中LLMs的有效替代方案，在隐私保护、成本和本地部署方面具有优势。

Abstract: [Context and motivation] Large language models (LLMs) show notable results in
natural language processing (NLP) tasks for requirements engineering (RE).
However, their use is compromised by high computational cost, data sharing
risks, and dependence on external services. In contrast, small language models
(SLMs) offer a lightweight, locally deployable alternative. [Question/problem]
It remains unclear how well SLMs perform compared to LLMs in RE tasks in terms
of accuracy. [Results] Our preliminary study compares eight models, including
three LLMs and five SLMs, on requirements classification tasks using the
PROMISE, PROMISE Reclass, and SecReq datasets. Our results show that although
LLMs achieve an average F1 score of 2% higher than SLMs, this difference is not
statistically significant. SLMs almost reach LLMs performance across all
datasets and even outperform them in recall on the PROMISE Reclass dataset,
despite being up to 300 times smaller. We also found that dataset
characteristics play a more significant role in performance than model size.
[Contribution] Our study contributes with evidence that SLMs are a valid
alternative to LLMs for requirements classification, offering advantages in
privacy, cost, and local deployability.

### [269] [Scalpel: Automotive Deep Learning Framework Testing via Assembling Model Components](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21451)
*Yinglong Zou,Juan Zhai,Chunrong Fang,An Guo,Jiawei Liu,Zhenyu Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了Scalpel方法，用于测试自动驾驶系统中的深度学习框架，通过组件级模型生成来解决现有测试方法无法检测框架质量问题的缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习框架测试方法无法检测自动驾驶系统中出现的独特质量问题，如内存崩溃和分配错误，因为这些方法生成的测试模型缺乏多输入/输出张量处理、多模态数据处理和多级数据特征提取等必要能力。

Method: Scalpel在模型组件级别生成测试输入模型，通过维护和更新模型组件库（包括头部、颈部、主干网络等），选择、变异和组装这些组件来生成支持自动驾驶系统所需能力的模型。

Result: 成功生成的模型被添加回组件库以丰富资源，新生成的模型通过差分测试在自动驾驶系统中部署，以测试汽车深度学习框架。

Conclusion: Scalpel方法通过组件级模型生成，有效解决了现有测试方法在检测自动驾驶深度学习框架质量问题方面的不足，提高了框架测试的覆盖率和有效性。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) plays a key role in autonomous driving systems. DL models
support perception modules, equipped with tasks such as object detection and
sensor fusion. These DL models enable vehicles to process multi-sensor inputs
to understand complex surroundings. Deploying DL models in autonomous driving
systems faces stringent challenges, including real-time processing, limited
computational resources, and strict power constraints. To address these
challenges, automotive DL frameworks (e.g., PaddleInference) have emerged to
optimize inference efficiency. However, these frameworks encounter unique
quality issues due to their more complex deployment environments, such as
crashes stemming from limited scheduled memory and incorrect memory allocation.
Unfortunately, existing DL framework testing methods fail to detect these
quality issues due to the failure in deploying generated test input models, as
these models lack three essential capabilities: (1) multi-input/output tensor
processing, (2) multi-modal data processing, and (3) multi-level data feature
extraction. These capabilities necessitate specialized model components, which
existing testing methods neglect during model generation. To bridge this gap,
we propose Scalpel, an automotive DL frameworks testing method that generates
test input models at the model component level. Scalpel generates models by
assembling model components (heads, necks, backbones) to support capabilities
required by autonomous driving systems. Specifically, Scalpel maintains and
updates a repository of model components, generating test inputs by selecting,
mutating, and assembling them. Successfully generated models are added back to
enrich the repository. Newly generated models are then deployed within the
autonomous driving system to test automotive DL frameworks via differential
testing.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个研究愿景：通过社会技术模型来支持软件供应链的自适应威胁检测，以应对日益增长的供应链攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件供应链攻击日益增多，但现有的技术监控方法忽视了社会技术动态，无法有效应对供应链的复杂性和动态变化。XZ Utils攻击案例表明，恶意行为者可以通过社交渠道破坏维护者信任。

Method: 提出开发社会技术模型来监控技术和社交数据，识别可疑行为趋势，从而指导有针对性的漏洞评估。

Result: 论文识别了实现这一愿景的挑战和研究方向，包括开发者和软件分析技术、去中心化自适应以及软件供应链安全研究测试平台的需求。

Conclusion: 通过整合社会技术分析，可以实现更有效的软件供应链威胁检测，弥补现有纯技术方法的不足。

Abstract: Software supply chains (SSCs) are complex systems composed of dynamic,
heterogeneous technical and social components which collectively achieve the
production and maintenance of software artefacts. Attacks on SSCs are
increasing, yet pervasive vulnerability analysis is challenging due to their
complexity. Therefore, threat detection must be targeted, to account for the
large and dynamic structure, and adaptive, to account for its change and
diversity. While current work focuses on technical approaches for monitoring
supply chain dependencies and establishing component controls, approaches which
inform threat detection through understanding the socio-technical dynamics are
lacking. We outline a position and research vision to develop and investigate
the use of socio-technical models to support adaptive threat detection of SSCs.
We motivate this approach through an analysis of the XZ Utils attack whereby
malicious actors undermined the maintainers' trust via the project's GitHub and
mailing lists. We highlight that monitoring technical and social data can
identify trends which indicate suspicious behaviour to then inform targeted and
intensive vulnerability assessment. We identify challenges and research
directions to achieve this vision considering techniques for developer and
software analysis, decentralised adaptation and the need for a test bed for
software supply chain security research.

TL;DR: 本文提出了BenchRisk框架，用于评估大语言模型基准测试的风险，识别了57种潜在故障模式和196种缓解策略，帮助用户更可靠地使用基准测试结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM基准测试可能存在各种故障模式，影响基准测试的可靠性，导致用户基于不准确的基准结果做出错误的LLM部署决策。

Method: 基于NIST风险管理流程，迭代分析26个流行基准测试，识别故障模式和缓解策略，开发BenchRisk评分系统评估基准测试风险。

Result: 所有26个基准测试在五个维度（全面性、可理解性、一致性、正确性和持久性）中的一个或多个维度存在显著风险，BenchRisk能够有效比较不同基准测试的风险水平。

Conclusion: LLM基准测试领域存在重要的开放研究方向，BenchRisk作为一个开源工具，有助于识别和共享基准测试风险及其缓解措施，提高基准测试的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) benchmarks inform LLM use decisions (e.g., "is
this LLM safe to deploy for my use case and context?"). However, benchmarks may
be rendered unreliable by various failure modes that impact benchmark bias,
variance, coverage, or people's capacity to understand benchmark evidence.
Using the National Institute of Standards and Technology's risk management
process as a foundation, this research iteratively analyzed 26 popular
benchmarks, identifying 57 potential failure modes and 196 corresponding
mitigation strategies. The mitigations reduce failure likelihood and/or
severity, providing a frame for evaluating "benchmark risk," which is scored to
provide a metaevaluation benchmark: BenchRisk. Higher scores indicate that
benchmark users are less likely to reach an incorrect or unsupported conclusion
about an LLM. All 26 scored benchmarks present significant risk within one or
more of the five scored dimensions (comprehensiveness, intelligibility,
consistency, correctness, and longevity), which points to important open
research directions for the field of LLM benchmarking. The BenchRisk workflow
allows for comparison between benchmarks; as an open-source tool, it also
facilitates the identification and sharing of risks and their mitigations.

TL;DR: 研究发现多个编码LLM之间存在显著互补性，集成模型的性能理论上可比最佳单模型提升83%。基于共识的策略容易陷入"流行度陷阱"，而基于多样性的策略能实现95%的理论潜力，即使是双模型集成也能有效提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前追求单一大型语言模型处理所有软件工程任务既资源密集又忽视了不同模型互补性的潜在优势，但如何最大化集成潜力尚不明确。

Method: 实证比较了5个家族的10个LLM和3个集成模型在代码生成和程序修复等3个软件工程基准上的表现，评估了模型间的互补性以及各种选择启发式方法。

Result: 集成模型的性能理论上限比最佳单模型高83%，基于共识的策略会放大常见但不正确的输出，而基于多样性的策略能实现95%的理论潜力，即使是小型双模型集成也能有效提升性能。

Conclusion: 通过基于多样性的策略利用多个LLM的互补性，可以实现成本效益高的性能提升，为超越单一模型系统提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Today's pursuit of a single Large Language Model (LMM) for all software
engineering tasks is resource-intensive and overlooks the potential benefits of
complementarity, where different models contribute unique strengths. However,
the degree to which coding LLMs complement each other and the best strategy for
maximizing an ensemble's potential are unclear, leaving practitioners without a
clear path to move beyond single-model systems.
  To address this gap, we empirically compare ten individual LLMs from five
families, and three ensembles of these LLMs across three software engineering
benchmarks covering code generation and program repair. We assess the
complementarity between models and the performance gap between the best
individual model and the ensembles. Next, we evaluate various selection
heuristics to identify correct solutions from an ensemble's candidate pool.
  We find that the theoretical upperbound for an ensemble's performance can be
83% above the best single model. Our results show that consensus-based
strategies for selecting solutions fall into a "popularity trap," amplifying
common but incorrect outputs. In contrast, a diversity-based strategy realizes
up to 95% of this theoretical potential, and proves effective even in small
two-model ensembles, enabling a cost-efficient way to enhance performance by
leveraging multiple LLMs.

TL;DR: 德国Heinrich Hertz卫星任务实现了首个周期性无人值守、全自动化的地面段运行系统，支持7x24小时自动化卫星平台操作和用户实验调度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为德国卫星通信任务Heinrich Hertz开发自动化地面段系统，实现无需人工干预的卫星操作和用户实验管理，提高运行效率和灵活性。

Method: 采用预计划和自动执行的时间表进行卫星跟踪、遥测和指令控制；用户任务与主任务计划分开规划并自动协调；自动化监控系统触发可配置的响应；通过自助服务门户提供24/7用户访问。

Result: 成功实现了全自动卫星平台操作（非工作时间）、用户实验的灵活调度（最短1分钟响应时间）、实时实验监控和RF测试设备访问。

Conclusion: 该自动化地面段概念为卫星任务提供了高效、灵活的无人值守运行能力，特别适用于科学实验任务，支持快速响应和持续运行。

Abstract: We present our approach for a periodically unstaffed, fully automated ground
segment. The concept is in use for the first time on the German satellite
communications mission Heinrich Hertz on behalf of the German Space Agency at
DLR. Heinrich Hertz was launched in July 2023 and offers access to scientific
and technical experiments to its users. The mission utilizes major automation
concepts for the satellite platform operations, allowing fully automated
operations outside of office hours. The concept includes tracking, telemetry
and commanding (TTC) of the satellite. Pre-planned and automatically executed
schedules enable commanding without human interaction. The user mission
schedule is planned separately from the main mission schedule and is
automatically de-conflicted. The automatic monitoring concept monitors the
systems of the satellite and all assets in the ground segment and triggers
reactions in operator-configurable ways depending on the mission needs, for
example emergency notifications or automated execution of flight operation
procedures. Additionally, the concept also puts special emphasis on a
self-service user portal that provides flexible access 24/7, even when the
control center is not staffed. The portal allows external users of the payload
to schedule pre-defined experiments, monitor the live execution of the
experiment with browser-based displays and access ground station telemetry and
dedicated RF test equipment during the time of their scheduled experiment.
Tasks can be planned long in advance as well as with a short reaction time
(less than 1 minute), which allows, for example, the reconfiguration of the
payload during a running experiment.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了GDPR合规性中需求和系统规范的联合规范需求，提出了基于GDPR法律概念建模的方法来支持隐私设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分处理GDPR中问题空间和解决方案空间的复杂交集，缺乏对实践者关于隐私设计规范目标和需求的深入理解。

Method: 通过回顾文献和访谈实践者，调查实践状态和理解规范目标，开发并评估了基于GDPR法律概念建模的需求和系统规范方法。

Result: 基于GDPR原始法律概念建模的方法有助于捕获法律知识、支持规范透明度和可追溯性，满足不同利益相关者的需求。

Conclusion: GDPR需求需要在工程生命周期的不同抽象层次上解决以实现隐私设计，法律知识应被捕获在规范中以确保合规性，同时需要进一步操作化该方法。

Abstract: Context: Consistent requirements and system specifications are essential for
the compliance of software systems towards the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR). Both artefacts need to be grounded in the original text and
conjointly assure the achievement of privacy by design (PbD). Objectives: There
is little understanding of the perspectives of practitioners on specification
objectives and goals to address PbD. Existing approaches do not account for the
complex intersection between problem and solution space expressed in GDPR. In
this study we explore the demand for conjoint requirements and system
specification for PbD and suggest an approach to address this demand. Methods:
We reviewed secondary and related primary studies and conducted interviews with
practitioners to (1) investigate the state-of-practice and (2) understand the
underlying specification objectives and goals (e.g., traceability). We
developed and evaluated an approach for requirements and systems specification
for PbD, and evaluated it against the specification objectives. Results: The
relationship between problem and solution space, as expressed in GDPR, is
instrumental in supporting PbD. We demonstrate how our approach, based on the
modeling GDPR content with original legal concepts, contributes to
specification objectives of capturing legal knowledge, supporting specification
transparency, and traceability. Conclusion: GDPR demands need to be addressed
throughout different levels of abstraction in the engineering lifecycle to
achieve PbD. Legal knowledge specified in the GDPR text should be captured in
specifications to address the demands of different stakeholders and ensure
compliance. While our results confirm the suitability of our approach to
address practical needs, we also revealed specific needs for the future
effective operationalization of the approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统设施选址问题中每个代理只关心最近的设施，但本文考虑每个代理希望所有委员会成员都接近自己的场景，需要同时优化总距离和保证公平代表性。

Method: 提出了新的算法来形成委员会，这些算法同时满足低成本、公平性和NORP（防止任何代理子集过度代表）的要求。

Result: 证明了总是可以找到既符合低成本目标，又满足现有公平概念和新提出的NORP准则的委员会。

Conclusion: 研究表明在度量空间中选择代表委员会时，可以同时实现低成本、公平性和代表性，为委员会选择问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We study the problem of selecting a representative committee of $k$ agents
from a collection of $n$ agents in a common metric space. This problem is
related to choosing $k$ facilities in facility location and $k$-median
problems. However, unlike in more traditional facility location where each
agent only cares about the closest selected facility, in the settings we
consider each agent desires that all selected committee members are close to
them. More precisely, we look at the sum objective, in which the goal is to
minimize the total distance from all agents to all members of the chosen
committee. We show that it is always possible to find a committee which is both
low-cost according to this objective, and also fair according to many existing
notions of fairness and proportionality defined for clustering settings.
Moreover, we introduce a new desirable axiom for representative committees we
call NORP, which prevents over-representation of any subset of agents. While
all existing algorithms for fair committee selection do not satisfy this
intuitive property, we provide new algorithms which form simultaneously
low-cost, fair, and NORP solutions, thus showing that it is always possible to
form low-cost, fair, and representative committees for our settings.

Motivation: 传统统一测试在异质策略性群体中会产生次优的统计误差，无法利用代理的私有信息来优化性能。

Method: 设计统计合同菜单，将类型最优测试与支付结构配对，诱导代理根据私有信息自选择，实现分离菜单设计。

Conclusion: 该工作连接了统计决策理论和机制设计，展示了如何利用异质性和策略性参与来提高假设检验的效率。

Abstract: We study hypothesis testing over a heterogeneous population of strategic
agents with private information. Any single test applied uniformly across the
population yields statistical error that is sub-optimal relative to the
performance of an oracle given access to the private information. We show how
it is possible to design menus of statistical contracts that pair type-optimal
tests with payoff structures, inducing agents to self-select according to their
private information. This separating menu elicits agent types and enables the
principal to match the oracle performance even without a priori knowledge of
the agent type. Our main result fully characterizes the collection of all
separating menus that are instance-adaptive, matching oracle performance for an
arbitrary population of heterogeneous agents. We identify designs where
information elicitation is essentially costless, requiring negligible
additional expense relative to a single-test benchmark, while improving
statistical performance. Our work establishes a connection between proper
scoring rules and menu design, showing how the structure of the hypothesis test
constrains the elicitable information. Numerical examples illustrate the
geometry of separating menus and the improvements they deliver in error
trade-offs. Overall, our results connect statistical decision theory with
mechanism design, demonstrating how heterogeneity and strategic participation
can be harnessed to improve efficiency in hypothesis testing.

Conclusion: 为网络环境下的移位贿赂问题提供了完整的复杂性图谱，揭示了社会影响力对贿赂策略的重要影响，并为不同网络结构提供了可行的算法解决方案。

Abstract: In shift bribery, a briber seeks to promote his preferred candidate by paying
voters to raise their ranking. Classical models of shift bribery assume voters
act independently, overlooking the role of social influence. However, in
reality, individuals are social beings and are often represented as part of a
social network, where bribed voters may influence their neighbors, thereby
amplifying the effect of persuasion. We study Shift bribery over Networks,
where voters are modeled as nodes in a directed weighted graph, and arcs
represent social influence between them. In this setting, bribery is not
confined to directly targeted voters its effects can propagate through the
network, influencing neighbors and amplifying persuasion. Given a budget and
individual cost functions for shifting each voter's preference toward a
designated candidate, the goal is to determine whether a shift strategy exists
within budget that ensures the preferred candidate wins after both direct and
network-propagated influence takes effect. We show that the problem is
NP-Complete even with two candidates and unit costs, and W[2]-hard when
parameterized by budget or maximum degree. On the positive side, we design
polynomial-time algorithms for complete graphs under plurality and majority
rules and path graphs for uniform edge weights, linear-time algorithms for
transitive tournaments for two candidates, linear cost functions and uniform
arc weights, and pseudo-polynomial algorithms for cluster graphs. We further
prove the existence of fixed-parameter tractable algorithms with treewidth as
parameter for two candidates, linear cost functions and uniform arc weights and
pseudo-FPT with cluster vertex deletion number for two candidates and uniform
arc weights. Together, these results give a detailed complexity landscape for
shift bribery in social networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为多智能体系统设计激励以诱导期望的纳什均衡是一个关键但具有挑战性的问题，特别是在智能体数量很大的情况下。

Method: 将激励设计问题形式化为参数化平均场博弈，并提出AMID算法，通过显式微分迭代均衡算子来高效计算梯度。

Result: 在Lipschitz条件下，有限N的激励设计目标以O(1/√N)的速率被PMFG近似；在顺序拍卖等非连续情况下也证明了相同的收敛速率。AMID算法在各种拍卖设置中显著提高了收益，优于现有基准方法。

Conclusion: AMID算法结合了近似边界和优化保证，为大规模智能体激励设计提供了一个强大且可扩展的算法工具。

Abstract: Designing incentives for a multi-agent system to induce a desirable Nash
equilibrium is both a crucial and challenging problem appearing in many
decision-making domains, especially for a large number of agents $N$. Under the
exchangeability assumption, we formalize this incentive design (ID) problem as
a parameterized mean-field game (PMFG), aiming to reduce complexity via an
infinite-population limit. We first show that when dynamics and rewards are
Lipschitz, the finite-$N$ ID objective is approximated by the PMFG at rate
$\mathscr{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}})$. Moreover, beyond the Lipschitz-continuous
setting, we prove the same $\mathscr{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}})$ decay for the
important special case of sequential auctions, despite discontinuities in
dynamics, through a tailored auction-specific analysis. Built on our novel
approximation results, we further introduce our Adjoint Mean-Field Incentive
Design (AMID) algorithm, which uses explicit differentiation of iterated
equilibrium operators to compute gradients efficiently. By uniting
approximation bounds with optimization guarantees, AMID delivers a powerful,
scalable algorithmic tool for many-agent (large $N$) ID. Across diverse auction
settings, the proposed AMID method substantially increases revenue over
first-price formats and outperforms existing benchmark methods.

Motivation: 差分隐私在纳什均衡计算中无法利用数据集先验分布知识，且对相关数据集的信息泄漏评估效果不佳

Method: 建立点态最大泄漏框架，结合玩家成本函数数据集的先验知识，获得具有PML保证的隐私泄漏精确可计算上界

Result: PML比DP提供更紧致的隐私保证，在相关数据集场景下PML下界可能超过DP上界，实验验证了框架的有效性

Conclusion: PML是比DP更合适的隐私度量标准，因为后者无法充分捕捉相关数据集中的隐私泄漏

Abstract: Privacy preservation has served as a key metric in designing Nash equilibrium
(NE) computation algorithms. Although differential privacy (DP) has been widely
employed for privacy guarantees, it does not exploit prior distributional
knowledge of datasets and is ineffective in assessing information leakage for
correlated datasets. To address these concerns, we establish a pointwise
maximal leakage (PML) framework when computing NE in aggregative games. By
incorporating prior knowledge of players' cost function datasets, we obtain a
precise and computable upper bound of privacy leakage with PML guarantees. In
the entire view, we show PML refines DP by offering a tighter privacy
guarantee, enabling flexibility in designing NE computation. Also, in the
individual view, we reveal that the lower bound of PML can exceed the upper
bound of DP by constructing specific correlated datasets. The results emphasize
that PML is a more proper privacy measure than DP since the latter fails to
adequately capture privacy leakage in correlated datasets. Moreover, we conduct
experiments with adversaries who attempt to infer players' private information
to illustrate the effectiveness of our framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户行为日益跨越多领域，现有跨域序列推荐方法忽略了域转移的复杂性，容易对密集域过拟合而对稀疏域欠拟合，且难以扩展到多域场景。

Method: 提出GMFlowRec框架，包含：统一双掩码Transformer分离域不变和域特定意图；高斯混合流场捕捉多样化行为模式；域对齐先验支持频繁和稀疏转移。

Result: 在JD和Amazon数据集上的广泛实验表明，GMFlowRec实现了最先进的性能，NDCG@5提升高达44%，同时通过单一统一骨干保持高效率。

Conclusion: GMFlowRec通过高斯混合流匹配有效解决了多域序列推荐中的域异构性和不平衡问题，具有可扩展性，适用于现实世界的多域推荐场景。

Abstract: Users increasingly interact with content across multiple domains, resulting
in sequential behaviors marked by frequent and complex transitions. While
Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) models two-domain interactions,
Multi-Domain Sequential Recommendation (MDSR) introduces significantly more
domain transitions, compounded by challenges such as domain heterogeneity and
imbalance. Existing approaches often overlook the intricacies of domain
transitions, tend to overfit to dense domains while underfitting sparse ones,
and struggle to scale effectively as the number of domains increases. We
propose \textit{GMFlowRec}, an efficient generative framework for MDSR that
models domain-aware transition trajectories via Gaussian Mixture Flow Matching.
GMFlowRec integrates: (1) a unified dual-masked Transformer to disentangle
domain-invariant and domain-specific intents, (2) a Gaussian Mixture flow field
to capture diverse behavioral patterns, and (3) a domain-aligned prior to
support frequent and sparse transitions. Extensive experiments on JD and Amazon

Abstract: This paper discusses the issue regarding Non-verbal Autism Spectrum Disorder.
It has been observed that this mental disorder is listed in major parts of the
world including the US, UK, and India. To mitigate this type of disorder, a
wide range of smartphones, computers, and artificial intelligence technologies
have been used. This technology has helped the population cope with
socialization and communication needs. Many applications have been developed to
enhance the communication capabilities of non-verbal autistic children. This
thesis project proposes the development of a platform that includes a web panel
and an Android mobile application to assist non-verbal autistic children in
communication, especially in Oman. Different interventions have been merged to
improve the quality of life for people on the autism spectrum. The main problem
identified in this case is that fragmented approaches are not suitable for
autistic children. The augmented reality framework provides the capability to
engage autistic children in creative play and self-reflection through
interactive screen-based activities.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: VOGUE是一个新颖的多模态对话推荐数据集，包含60个真实时尚购物场景的人类对话，配有视觉目录、用户档案和历史记录，以及对话后评分，用于评估对话推理和推荐系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态对话推荐数据集存在局限性：要么模拟对话，要么忽略用户历史，要么缺乏详细反馈，限制了研究和评估的范围。

Method: 构建VOGUE数据集，包含人类对话、共享视觉目录、物品元数据、用户时尚档案和历史记录，以及对话后评分，支持对话推理的严格评估。

Result: 分析显示视觉对话具有独特动态，推荐者经常按特征组同时推荐物品。多模态大语言模型在总体对齐上接近人类水平，但在重现人类评分分布和泛化偏好推理方面存在系统误差。

Conclusion: VOGUE为研究多模态对话系统提供了独特资源，同时作为挑战数据集，超越了当前顶级多模态基础模型的推荐能力。

Abstract: Multimodal conversational recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm
for delivering personalized experiences through natural dialogue enriched by
visual and contextual grounding. Yet, current multimodal conversational
recommendation datasets remain limited: existing resources either simulate
conversations, omit user history, or fail to collect sufficiently detailed
feedback, all of which constrain the types of research and evaluation they
support.
  To address these gaps, we introduce VOGUE, a novel dataset of 60 humanhuman
dialogues in realistic fashion shopping scenarios. Each dialogue is paired with
a shared visual catalogue, item metadata, user fashion profiles and histories,
and post-conversation ratings from both Seekers and Assistants. This design
enables rigorous evaluation of conversational inference, including not only
alignment between predicted and ground-truth preferences, but also calibration
against full rating distributions and comparison with explicit and implicit
user satisfaction signals.
  Our initial analyses of VOGUE reveal distinctive dynamics of visually
grounded dialogue. For example, recommenders frequently suggest items
simultaneously in feature-based groups, which creates distinct conversational
phases bridged by Seeker critiques and refinements. Benchmarking multimodal
large language models against human recommenders shows that while MLLMs
approach human-level alignment in aggregate, they exhibit systematic
distribution errors in reproducing human ratings and struggle to generalize
preference inference beyond explicitly discussed items. These findings
establish VOGUE as both a unique resource for studying multimodal
conversational systems and as a challenge dataset beyond the current
recommendation capabilities of existing top-tier multimodal foundation models
such as GPT-4o-mini, GPT-5-mini, and Gemini-2.5-Flash.

TL;DR: BLOGER是一个用于生成式推荐的双层优化框架，通过统一优化分词器和推荐器来解决现有方法中两者分离导致的标识符与推荐目标不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式推荐方法将分词器和推荐器分开训练（顺序或交替），忽视了它们之间的相互依赖关系，导致分词器训练缺乏推荐目标的直接指导，产生次优标识符并降低推荐性能。

Method: 采用双层优化框架：下层用分词序列训练推荐器，上层基于分词损失和推荐损失优化分词器。使用元学习方法高效求解，并引入梯度手术缓解上层更新中的梯度冲突。

Result: 在真实数据集上的大量实验表明，BLOGER持续优于最先进的生成式推荐方法，同时保持实用效率，没有显著增加计算开销。

Conclusion: BLOGER有效弥合了项目分词和自回归生成之间的差距，确保项目标识符既具有信息性又与推荐目标对齐。

Abstract: Generative recommendation is emerging as a transformative paradigm by
directly generating recommended items, rather than relying on matching.
Building such a system typically involves two key components: (1) optimizing
the tokenizer to derive suitable item identifiers, and (2) training the
recommender based on those identifiers. Existing approaches often treat these
components separately--either sequentially or in alternation--overlooking their
interdependence. This separation can lead to misalignment: the tokenizer is
trained without direct guidance from the recommendation objective, potentially
yielding suboptimal identifiers that degrade recommendation performance.
  To address this, we propose BLOGER, a Bi-Level Optimization for GEnerative
Recommendation framework, which explicitly models the interdependence between
the tokenizer and the recommender in a unified optimization process. The lower
level trains the recommender using tokenized sequences, while the upper level
optimizes the tokenizer based on both the tokenization loss and recommendation
loss. We adopt a meta-learning approach to solve this bi-level optimization
efficiently, and introduce gradient surgery to mitigate gradient conflicts in
the upper-level updates, thereby ensuring that item identifiers are both
informative and recommendation-aligned. Extensive experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate that BLOGER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
generative recommendation methods while maintaining practical efficiency with
no significant additional computational overhead, effectively bridging the gap
between item tokenization and autoregressive generation.

TL;DR: 提出了个性化上下文感知分词器，将用户历史交互融入语义ID生成，使同一物品在不同用户上下文中被分词为不同的语义ID，从而在生成式推荐中实现更个性化的预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式推荐模型的分词方法是静态和非个性化的，仅基于物品特征生成语义ID，假设了通用的物品相似性标准，忽略了用户特定的视角和偏好。

Method: 设计了个性化上下文感知分词器，在生成语义ID时融入用户的历史交互信息，使同一物品在不同用户上下文中可以被分词为不同的语义ID。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验表明，相比非个性化动作分词基线，NDCG@10指标提升了最高11.44%。

Conclusion: 个性化上下文感知分词器能够使生成式推荐模型捕捉多种解释标准，产生更个性化的预测，显著提升推荐性能。

Abstract: Generative recommendation (GR) models tokenize each action into a few
discrete tokens (called semantic IDs) and autoregressively generate the next
tokens as predictions, showing advantages such as memory efficiency,
scalability, and the potential to unify retrieval and ranking. Despite these
benefits, existing tokenization methods are static and non-personalized. They
typically derive semantic IDs solely from item features, assuming a universal
item similarity that overlooks user-specific perspectives. However, under the
autoregressive paradigm, semantic IDs with the same prefixes always receive
similar probabilities, so a single fixed mapping implicitly enforces a
universal item similarity standard across all users. In practice, the same item
may be interpreted differently depending on user intentions and preferences. To
address this issue, we propose a personalized context-aware tokenizer that
incorporates a user's historical interactions when generating semantic IDs.
This design allows the same item to be tokenized into different semantic IDs
under different user contexts, enabling GR models to capture multiple
interpretive standards and produce more personalized predictions. Experiments
on three public datasets demonstrate up to 11.44% improvement in NDCG@10 over
non-personalized action tokenization baselines. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了CausalRec框架，通过因果注意力机制改进序列推荐系统，结合因果发现模块和CausalBooster来识别用户行为中的因果关系，提升推荐准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于相关性的序列推荐系统仅关注物品共现，忽视了用户行为背后的因果动机，导致虚假相关性和不准确的推荐。

Method: CausalRec包含因果发现模块学习用户行为序列的因果图，并提供理论保证因果图的可识别性；CausalBooster利用发现的因果图改进注意力机制，优先考虑具有因果重要性的行为。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，CausalRec在Hit Rate和NDCG指标上分别平均提升7.21%和8.65%，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 这是首个通过注意力机制整合因果关系的序列推荐模型，证明了因果关系在生成更准确可靠推荐中的价值。

Abstract: Recent advances in correlation-based sequential recommendation systems have
demonstrated substantial success. Specifically, the attention-based model
outperforms other RNN-based and Markov chains-based models by capturing both
short- and long-term dependencies more effectively. However, solely focusing on
item co-occurrences overlooks the underlying motivations behind user behaviors,
leading to spurious correlations and potentially inaccurate recommendations. To
address this limitation, we present a novel framework that integrates causal
attention for sequential recommendation, CausalRec. It incorporates a causal
discovery block and a CausalBooster. The causal discovery block learns the
causal graph in user behavior sequences, and we provide a theory to guarantee
the identifiability of the learned causal graph. The CausalBooster utilizes the
discovered causal graph to refine the attention mechanism, prioritizing
behaviors with causal significance. Experimental evaluations on real-world
datasets indicate that CausalRec outperforms several state-of-the-art methods,
with average improvements of 7.21% in Hit Rate (HR) and 8.65% in Normalized
Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG). To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first model to incorporate causality through the attention mechanism in
sequential recommendation, demonstrating the value of causality in generating
more accurate and reliable recommendations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐系统缺乏透明度，而基于自然语言用户档案的推荐系统能提供更好的透明度和用户控制，但该领域缺乏大规模公开测试集进行评估。

Method: 通过作者发表历史生成自然语言用户档案和对应真实推荐项，构建SciNUP数据集，并比较稀疏检索、密集检索和基于LLM的重排器等基线方法。

Result: 基线方法性能相当但推荐不同项目，表现出互补行为，同时仍有很大改进空间。

Conclusion: SciNUP数据集为基于自然语言的推荐方法研究提供了宝贵资源，推动了该领域的未来发展。

Abstract: The use of natural language (NL) user profiles in recommender systems offers
greater transparency and user control compared to traditional representations.
However, there is scarcity of large-scale, publicly available test collections
for evaluating NL profile-based recommendation. To address this gap, we
introduce SciNUP, a novel synthetic dataset for scholarly recommendation that
leverages authors' publication histories to generate NL profiles and
corresponding ground truth items. We use this dataset to conduct a comparison
of baseline methods, ranging from sparse and dense retrieval approaches to
state-of-the-art LLM-based rerankers. Our results show that while baseline
methods achieve comparable performance, they often retrieve different items,
indicating complementary behaviors. At the same time, considerable headroom for
improvement remains, highlighting the need for effective NL-based
recommendation approaches. The SciNUP dataset thus serves as a valuable
resource for fostering future research and development in this area.

Abstract: Deep Research systems have revolutionized how LLMs solve complex questions
through iterative reasoning and evidence gathering. However, current systems
remain fundamentally constrained to textual web data, overlooking the vast
knowledge embedded in multimodal documents Processing such documents demands
sophisticated parsing to preserve visual semantics (figures, tables, charts,
and equations), intelligent chunking to maintain structural coherence, and
adaptive retrieval across modalities, which are capabilities absent in existing
systems. In response, we present Doc-Researcher, a unified system that bridges
this gap through three integrated components: (i) deep multimodal parsing that
preserves layout structure and visual semantics while creating multi-granular
representations from chunk to document level, (ii) systematic retrieval
architecture supporting text-only, vision-only, and hybrid paradigms with
dynamic granularity selection, and (iii) iterative multi-agent workflows that
decompose complex queries, progressively accumulate evidence, and synthesize
comprehensive answers across documents and modalities. To enable rigorous
evaluation, we introduce M4DocBench, the first benchmark for Multi-modal,
Multi-hop, Multi-document, and Multi-turn deep research. Featuring 158
expert-annotated questions with complete evidence chains across 304 documents,
M4DocBench tests capabilities that existing benchmarks cannot assess.
Experiments demonstrate that Doc-Researcher achieves 50.6% accuracy, 3.4xbetter
than state-of-the-art baselines, validating that effective document research
requires not just better retrieval, but fundamentally deep parsing that
preserve multimodal integrity and support iterative research. Our work
establishes a new paradigm for conducting deep research on multimodal document
collections.

Conclusion: 系统化的数据工程可以产生与复杂模型修改相当甚至更易于部署的影响，为在真实电商环境中构建鲁棒的多语言搜索系统提供了可操作的指导。

Abstract: Multilingual e-commerce search suffers from severe data imbalance across
languages, label noise, and limited supervision for low-resource
languages--challenges that impede the cross-lingual generalization of relevance
models despite the strong capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In this
work, we present a practical, architecture-agnostic, data-centric framework to
enhance performance on two core tasks: Query-Category (QC) relevance (matching
queries to product categories) and Query-Item (QI) relevance (matching queries
to product titles). Rather than altering the model, we redesign the training
data through three complementary strategies: (1) translation-based augmentation
to synthesize examples for languages absent in training, (2) semantic negative
sampling to generate hard negatives and mitigate class imbalance, and (3)
self-validation filtering to detect and remove likely mislabeled instances.
Evaluated on the CIKM AnalytiCup 2025 dataset, our approach consistently yields
substantial F1 score improvements over strong LLM baselines, achieving
competitive results in the official competition. Our findings demonstrate that
systematic data engineering can be as impactful as--and often more deployable
than--complex model modifications, offering actionable guidance for building
robust multilingual search systems in the real-world e-commerce settings.
