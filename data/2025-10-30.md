*Haoyang Zhang,Zhou Yang,Ke Sun,Yucai Pang,Guoliang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于多路径跨模态交互的混合网络模型MCIHN，通过对抗自编码器学习各模态的判别性情感特征，使用跨模态门机制减少模态间差异并生成交互特征，最终通过特征融合实现多模态情感识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态情感识别在人机交互中至关重要，但由于不同模态间的差异以及单模态情感信息表征困难，准确的情感识别仍面临重大挑战。

Method: 为每个模态构建对抗自编码器学习判别性情感特征，通过跨模态门机制模型减少模态间差异并建立情感关系，最后使用特征融合模块进行多模态融合。

Result: 在公开的SIMS和MOSI数据集上的实验表明，MCIHN取得了优越的性能。

Conclusion: MCIHN模型通过多路径跨模态交互有效解决了多模态情感识别中的模态差异和特征表征问题，实现了更好的情感识别效果。

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition is crucial for future human-computer
interaction. However, accurate emotion recognition still faces significant
challenges due to differences between different modalities and the difficulty
of characterizing unimodal emotional information. To solve these problems, a
hybrid network model based on multipath cross-modal interaction (MCIHN) is
proposed. First, adversarial autoencoders (AAE) are constructed separately for
each modality. The AAE learns discriminative emotion features and reconstructs
the features through a decoder to obtain more discriminative information about
the emotion classes. Then, the latent codes from the AAE of different
modalities are fed into a predefined Cross-modal Gate Mechanism model (CGMM) to
reduce the discrepancy between modalities, establish the emotional relationship
between interacting modalities, and generate the interaction features between
different modalities. Multimodal fusion using the Feature Fusion module (FFM)
for better emotion recognition. Experiments were conducted on publicly
available SIMS and MOSI datasets, demonstrating that MCIHN achieves superior
performance.

### [2] [DrivingScene: A Multi-Task Online Feed-Forward 3D Gaussian Splatting Method for Dynamic Driving Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24734)
*Qirui Hou,Wenzhang Sun,Chang Zeng,Chunfeng Wang,Hao Li,Jianxun Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DrivingScene是一个在线前馈框架，仅使用两个连续环视图像就能重建4D动态驾驶场景，通过轻量级残差流网络预测动态物体的非刚性运动，在质量和效率上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时高保真重建动态驾驶场景面临复杂动态和稀疏视图的挑战，现有方法难以平衡质量和效率。

Method: 提出轻量级残差流网络，在学习的静态场景先验基础上预测每个相机的动态物体非刚性运动，通过场景流显式建模动态；采用由粗到细的训练范式避免端到端方法的不稳定性。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的实验表明，该仅使用图像的方法能在线生成高质量深度、场景流和3D高斯点云，在动态重建和新视角合成方面显著优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: DrivingScene框架有效解决了动态驾驶场景重建中质量与效率的平衡问题，为实时应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time, high-fidelity reconstruction of dynamic driving scenes is
challenged by complex dynamics and sparse views, with prior methods struggling
to balance quality and efficiency. We propose DrivingScene, an online,
feed-forward framework that reconstructs 4D dynamic scenes from only two
consecutive surround-view images. Our key innovation is a lightweight residual
flow network that predicts the non-rigid motion of dynamic objects per camera
on top of a learned static scene prior, explicitly modeling dynamics via scene
flow. We also introduce a coarse-to-fine training paradigm that circumvents the
instabilities common to end-to-end approaches. Experiments on nuScenes dataset
show our image-only method simultaneously generates high-quality depth, scene
flow, and 3D Gaussian point clouds online, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in both dynamic reconstruction and novel view
synthesis.

### [3] [Towards Fine-Grained Human Motion Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24767)
*Guorui Song,Guocun Wang,Zhe Huang,Jing Lin,Xuefei Zhe,Jian Li,Haoqian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了M-ACM模型，通过结合运动感知解码来增强视频描述质量，利用人体网格恢复的运动表示来突出人体动态，减少幻觉并提高语义保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频描述方法难以捕捉细粒度运动细节，导致描述模糊或语义不一致。

Method: M-ACM框架利用人体网格恢复得到的运动表示，通过运动感知解码来增强描述生成。

Result: 实验结果表明M-ACM在准确描述复杂人体运动和细微时间变化方面显著优于先前方法。

Conclusion: M-ACM为运动中心视频描述设立了新标准，并提供了HMI数据集和HMI-Bench基准来支持该领域研究。

Abstract: Generating accurate descriptions of human actions in videos remains a
challenging task for video captioning models. Existing approaches often
struggle to capture fine-grained motion details, resulting in vague or
semantically inconsistent captions. In this work, we introduce the
Motion-Augmented Caption Model (M-ACM), a novel generative framework that
enhances caption quality by incorporating motion-aware decoding. At its core,
M-ACM leverages motion representations derived from human mesh recovery to
explicitly highlight human body dynamics, thereby reducing hallucinations and
improving both semantic fidelity and spatial alignment in the generated
captions. To support research in this area, we present the Human Motion Insight
(HMI) Dataset, comprising 115K video-description pairs focused on human
movement, along with HMI-Bench, a dedicated benchmark for evaluating
motion-focused video captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that M-ACM
significantly outperforms previous methods in accurately describing complex
human motions and subtle temporal variations, setting a new standard for
motion-centric video captioning.

### [4] [Combining SAR Simulators to Train ATR Models with Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24768)
*Benjamin Camus,Julien Houssay,Corentin Le Barbu,Eric Monteux,Cédric Saleun,Christian Cochin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用两种不同模拟器(MOCEM和Salsa)生成合成SAR图像来训练深度学习模型进行自动目标识别，解决了真实标注数据缺乏的问题，在MSTAR数据集上达到近88%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决合成孔径雷达(SAR)图像自动目标识别中真实标注数据稀缺的问题，通过合成数据训练深度学习模型，但需要克服模拟数据与真实测量之间的领域差异。

Method: 结合两种基于不同物理模型的SAR模拟器(MOCEM基于散射中心模型，Salsa基于光线追踪策略)生成合成数据集，使用ADASCA深度学习方法训练ATR模型。

Result: 在MSTAR真实测量数据上达到了接近88%的识别准确率，证明了多模拟器组合方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过结合互补的模拟器生成多样化的合成数据，可以有效提升深度学习模型在真实SAR图像上的泛化能力，为解决缺乏真实标注数据的ATR问题提供了可行方案。

Abstract: This work aims to train Deep Learning models to perform Automatic Target
Recognition (ATR) on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. To circumvent the
lack of real labelled measurements, we resort to synthetic data produced by SAR
simulators. Simulation offers full control over the virtual environment, which
enables us to generate large and diversified datasets at will. However,
simulations are intrinsically grounded on simplifying assumptions of the real
world (i.e. physical models). Thus, synthetic datasets are not as
representative as real measurements. Consequently, ATR models trained on
synthetic images cannot generalize well on real measurements. Our contributions
to this problem are twofold: on one hand, we demonstrate and quantify the
impact of the simulation paradigm on the ATR. On the other hand, we propose a
new approach to tackle the ATR problem: combine two SAR simulators that are
grounded on different (but complementary) paradigms to produce synthetic
datasets. To this end, we use two simulators: MOCEM, which is based on a
scattering centers model approach, and Salsa, which resorts on a ray tracing
strategy. We train ATR models using synthetic dataset generated both by MOCEM
and Salsa and our Deep Learning approach called ADASCA. We reach an accuracy of
almost 88 % on the MSTAR measurements.

### [5] [Point-level Uncertainty Evaluation of Mobile Laser Scanning Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24773)
*Ziyang Xu,Olaf Wysocki,Christoph Holst*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于机器学习的移动激光扫描点云不确定性评估框架，使用随机森林和XGBoost模型学习几何特征与点级误差的关系，无需高精度参考数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统后向不确定性建模依赖高精度参考数据，成本高且难以大规模获取，需要一种可扩展的数据驱动方法。

Method: 使用随机森林和XGBoost集成学习模型，基于局部几何特征预测点级不确定性，采用空间分区验证避免数据泄露。

Result: 两种模型均能有效捕捉几何特征与不确定性的非线性关系，平均ROC-AUC值超过0.87，高程变化、点密度和局部结构复杂度是关键特征。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模点云质量控制和误差分析提供了可扩展的数据驱动基础，无需昂贵参考数据。

Abstract: Reliable quantification of uncertainty in Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) point
clouds is essential for ensuring the accuracy and credibility of downstream
applications such as 3D mapping, modeling, and change analysis. Traditional
backward uncertainty modeling heavily rely on high-precision reference data,
which are often costly or infeasible to obtain at large scales. To address this
issue, this study proposes a machine learning-based framework for point-level
uncertainty evaluation that learns the relationship between local geometric
features and point-level errors. The framework is implemented using two
ensemble learning models, Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost, which are trained and
validated on a spatially partitioned real-world dataset to avoid data leakage.
Experimental results demonstrate that both models can effectively capture the
nonlinear relationships between geometric characteristics and uncertainty,
achieving mean ROC-AUC values above 0.87. The analysis further reveals that
geometric features describing elevation variation, point density, and local
structural complexity play a dominant role in predicting uncertainty. The
proposed framework offers a data-driven perspective of uncertainty evaluation,
providing a scalable and adaptable foundation for future quality control and
error analysis of large-scale point clouds.

### [6] [Cross-Enhanced Multimodal Fusion of Eye-Tracking and Facial Features for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24777)
*Yujie Nie,Jianzhang Ni,Yonglong Ye,Yuan-Ting Zhang,Yun Kwok Wing,Xiangqing Xu,Xin Ma,Lizhou Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种多模态交叉增强融合框架，结合眼动追踪和面部特征进行阿尔茨海默病辅助诊断，通过交叉注意力机制和方向感知卷积模块实现多模态表征学习，在自建数据集上达到95.11%的分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病的准确诊断对及时干预至关重要。眼动追踪和面部特征作为认知功能的重要指标，能反映注意力分布和神经认知状态，但很少有研究探索它们的联合集成用于AD辅助诊断。

Method: 提出多模态交叉增强融合框架，包含两个关键模块：(1)交叉增强融合注意力模块(CEFAM)，通过交叉注意力和全局增强建模模态间交互；(2)方向感知卷积模块(DACM)，通过水平-垂直感受野捕获细粒度方向性面部特征。

Result: 在包含25名AD患者和25名健康对照的自建同步多模态数据集上，该框架优于传统的后期融合和特征拼接方法，在区分AD与HC时达到95.11%的分类准确率。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模模态间依赖关系和模态特定贡献，该框架在阿尔茨海默病诊断中展现出卓越的鲁棒性和诊断性能，为多模态辅助诊断提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for enabling
timely intervention and slowing disease progression. Multimodal diagnostic
approaches offer considerable promise by integrating complementary information
across behavioral and perceptual domains. Eye-tracking and facial features, in
particular, are important indicators of cognitive function, reflecting
attentional distribution and neurocognitive state. However, few studies have
explored their joint integration for auxiliary AD diagnosis. In this study, we
propose a multimodal cross-enhanced fusion framework that synergistically
leverages eye-tracking and facial features for AD detection. The framework
incorporates two key modules: (a) a Cross-Enhanced Fusion Attention Module
(CEFAM), which models inter-modal interactions through cross-attention and
global enhancement, and (b) a Direction-Aware Convolution Module (DACM), which
captures fine-grained directional facial features via horizontal-vertical
receptive fields. Together, these modules enable adaptive and discriminative
multimodal representation learning. To support this work, we constructed a
synchronized multimodal dataset, including 25 patients with AD and 25 healthy
controls (HC), by recording aligned facial video and eye-tracking sequences
during a visual memory-search paradigm, providing an ecologically valid
resource for evaluating integration strategies. Extensive experiments on this
dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms traditional late fusion and
feature concatenation methods, achieving a classification accuracy of 95.11% in
distinguishing AD from HC, highlighting superior robustness and diagnostic
performance by explicitly modeling inter-modal dependencies and
modality-specific contributions.

Abstract: Intelligent vehicles are one of the most important outcomes gained from the
world tendency toward automation. Applications of IVs, whether in urban roads
or robot tracks, do prioritize lane path detection. This paper proposes an
FPGA-based Lane Detector Vehicle LDV architecture that relies on the Sobel
algorithm for edge detection. Operating on 416 x 416 images and 150 MHz, the
system can generate a valid output every 1.17 ms. The valid output consists of
the number of present lanes, the current lane index, as well as its right and
left boundaries. Additionally, the automated light and temperature control
units in the proposed system enhance its adaptability to the surrounding
environmental conditions.

*Mingzhi Zhu,Ding Shang,Sai Qian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ESCA框架，通过后训练量化和定制硬件加速器优化Codec Avatar模型，在VR设备上实现高质量实时渲染


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VR设备上Codec Avatar模型计算需求大、实时推理困难的问题，满足VR应用对延迟和功耗的严格要求

Method: 采用后训练量化方法降低模型精度，设计定制硬件加速器集成到VR设备SoC中，构建完整的优化框架ESCA

Result: FovVideoVDP质量评分比最佳4位基线提升+0.39，延迟降低3.36倍，端到端测试中维持100fps渲染速率

Conclusion: 证明了在资源受限设备上部署高保真Codec Avatar的可行性，为更沉浸式和便携的VR体验打开了大门

Abstract: Photorealistic Codec Avatars (PCA), which generate high-fidelity human face
renderings, are increasingly being used in Virtual Reality (VR) environments to
enable immersive communication and interaction through deep learning-based
generative models. However, these models impose significant computational
demands, making real-time inference challenging on resource-constrained VR
devices such as head-mounted displays, where latency and power efficiency are
critical. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient post-training
quantization (PTQ) method tailored for Codec Avatar models, enabling
low-precision execution without compromising output quality. In addition, we
design a custom hardware accelerator that can be integrated into the
system-on-chip of VR devices to further enhance processing efficiency. Building
on these components, we introduce ESCA, a full-stack optimization framework
that accelerates PCA inference on edge VR platforms. Experimental results
demonstrate that ESCA boosts FovVideoVDP quality scores by up to $+0.39$ over
the best 4-bit baseline, delivers up to $3.36\times$ latency reduction, and
sustains a rendering rate of 100 frames per second in end-to-end tests,
satisfying real-time VR requirements. These results demonstrate the feasibility
of deploying high-fidelity codec avatars on resource-constrained devices,
opening the door to more immersive and portable VR experiences.

*Xinjian Zhao,Wei Pang,Zhongkai Xue,Xiangru Jian,Lei Zhang,Yaoyao Xu,Xiaozhuang Song,Shu Wu,Tianshu Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文发现视觉模型在图结构理解方面具有与GNNs相当的性能，但在全局结构感知方面表现更优，特别是在GraphAbstract基准测试中显著优于GNNs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视觉模型在图理解方面的潜力，因为GNNs采用自下而上的消息传递机制，与人类先感知全局结构的视觉认知方式存在根本差异。

Method: 引入GraphAbstract基准测试，评估模型感知全局图属性的能力，包括识别组织原型、检测对称性、感知连接强度和识别关键元素。

Result: 视觉模型在需要整体结构理解的任务上显著优于GNNs，且在不同图规模下保持泛化能力，而GNNs在全局模式抽象方面表现不佳且随图规模增大性能下降。

Conclusion: 视觉模型具有显著但未被充分利用的图结构理解能力，特别是在需要全局拓扑意识和尺度不变推理的问题上，为开发更有效的图基础模型开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks operate through bottom-up message-passing,
fundamentally differing from human visual perception, which intuitively
captures global structures first. We investigate the underappreciated potential
of vision models for graph understanding, finding they achieve performance
comparable to GNNs on established benchmarks while exhibiting distinctly
different learning patterns. These divergent behaviors, combined with
limitations of existing benchmarks that conflate domain features with
topological understanding, motivate our introduction of GraphAbstract. This
benchmark evaluates models' ability to perceive global graph properties as
humans do: recognizing organizational archetypes, detecting symmetry, sensing
connectivity strength, and identifying critical elements. Our results reveal
that vision models significantly outperform GNNs on tasks requiring holistic
structural understanding and maintain generalizability across varying graph
scales, while GNNs struggle with global pattern abstraction and degrade with
increasing graph size. This work demonstrates that vision models possess
remarkable yet underutilized capabilities for graph structural understanding,
particularly for problems requiring global topological awareness and
scale-invariant reasoning. These findings open new avenues to leverage this
underappreciated potential for developing more effective graph foundation
models for tasks dominated by holistic pattern recognition.

*Jingjun Bi,Fadi Dornaika*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RSGSLM方法，结合图卷积网络、伪标签和拓扑平衡校正，用于多视图数据的半监督学习


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像中缺乏清晰图结构以及多视图数据复杂性限制传统方法效率的问题，特别是多视图数据中图结构整合的挑战

Method: 结合线性特征变换和多视图图融合于GCN框架；动态将伪标签纳入GCN损失函数；通过调整类边界附近标记样本权重来校正拓扑不平衡；引入适用于所有样本的无监督平滑损失

Result: 在多视图基准图像数据集上的实验结果表明，RSGSLM在多视图场景下超越了现有的半监督学习方法

Conclusion: RSGSLM通过优化图结构整合和伪标签策略，有效提升了多视图半监督学习的性能，同时保持了计算效率

Abstract: Recently, graph-based semi-supervised learning and pseudo-labeling have
gained attention due to their effectiveness in reducing the need for extensive
data annotations. Pseudo-labeling uses predictions from unlabeled data to
improve model training, while graph-based methods are characterized by
processing data represented as graphs. However, the lack of clear graph
structures in images combined with the complexity of multi-view data limits the
efficiency of traditional and existing techniques. Moreover, the integration of
graph structures in multi-view data is still a challenge. In this paper, we
propose Re-node Self-taught Graph-based Semi-supervised Learning for Multi-view
Data (RSGSLM). Our method addresses these challenges by (i) combining linear
feature transformation and multi-view graph fusion within a Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN) framework, (ii) dynamically incorporating pseudo-labels into the
GCN loss function to improve classification in multi-view data, and (iii)
correcting topological imbalances by adjusting the weights of labeled samples
near class boundaries. Additionally, (iv) we introduce an unsupervised
smoothing loss applicable to all samples. This combination optimizes
performance while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results on
multi-view benchmark image datasets demonstrate that RSGSLM surpasses existing
semi-supervised learning approaches in multi-view contexts.

*Patrick Haller,Fabio Barth,Jonas Golde,Georg Rehm,Alan Akbik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PISA-Bench是一个多语言视觉语言基准测试，基于专家创建的PISA测试构建，包含6种语言的并行语料库，用于评估多模态推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试缺乏高质量的人工验证示例，许多数据集依赖LLM生成内容且仅限于英语，需要填补多语言高质量基准的空白。

Method: 从英语PISA测试中提取人工标注的指令、问题、选项和图像，翻译成5种其他语言，构建完全平行的6语言语料库。

Result: 评估发现小模型(<20B参数)表现不佳，非英语分割性能显著下降，在空间和几何推理任务上错误率高。

Conclusion: PISA-Bench为推进多语言多模态推理研究提供了重要资源，揭示了当前模型在多语言和复杂推理任务上的局限性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
multimodal reasoning. However, existing benchmarks remain limited in terms of
high-quality, human-verified examples. Many current datasets rely on
synthetically generated content by large language models (LLMs). Furthermore,
most datasets are limited to English, as manual quality assurance of translated
samples is time-consuming and costly. To fill this gap, we introduce
PISA-Bench, a multilingual benchmark derived from English examples of the
expert-created PISA tests, a unified framework for the assessment of student
competencies in over eighty countries. Each example consists of human-extracted
instructions, questions, answer options, and images, enriched with question
type categories, and has been translated from English into five additional
languages (Spanish, German, Chinese, French, and Italian), resulting in a fully
parallel corpus covering six languages. We evaluate state-of-the-art
vision-language models on PISA-Bench and find that especially small models
(<20B parameters) fail to achieve high test scores. We further find substantial
performance degradation on non-English splits as well as high error-rates when
models are tasked with spatial and geometric reasoning. By releasing the
dataset and evaluation framework, we provide a resource for advancing research
on multilingual multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) represent a significant frontier in
embodied intelligence, aiming to bridge digital knowledge with physical-world
interaction. While these models have demonstrated remarkable generalist
capabilities, their deployment is severely hampered by the substantial
computational and data requirements inherent to their underlying large-scale
foundation models. Motivated by the urgent need to address these challenges,
this survey presents the first comprehensive review of Efficient
Vision-Language-Action models (Efficient VLAs) across the entire
data-model-training process. Specifically, we introduce a unified taxonomy to
systematically organize the disparate efforts in this domain, categorizing
current techniques into three core pillars: (1) Efficient Model Design,
focusing on efficient architectures and model compression; (2) Efficient
Training, which reduces computational burdens during model learning; and (3)
Efficient Data Collection, which addresses the bottlenecks in acquiring and
utilizing robotic data. Through a critical review of state-of-the-art methods
within this framework, this survey not only establishes a foundational
reference for the community but also summarizes representative applications,
delineates key challenges, and charts a roadmap for future research. We
maintain a continuously updated project page to track our latest developments:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现12/13的视觉语言模型表现出与人类冲突适应相似的行为模式，通过稀疏自编码器在InternVL模型中识别出与任务相关的超节点，发现了与人类阅读和颜色命名自动性不对称相似的神经表征模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人工智能模型是否表现出类似人类认知控制的冲突适应现象，理解模型内部表征如何支持这种高级认知行为。

Method: 使用顺序Stroop任务测试13个视觉语言模型，采用稀疏自编码器分析InternVL模型的内部表征，识别任务相关超节点并进行消融实验。

Result: 12个模型表现出冲突适应行为，在InternVL中发现部分重叠的文本和颜色超节点，并识别出冲突调节超节点，其消融显著增加Stroop错误。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型能够模拟人类认知控制的冲突适应现象，其内部表征结构与人类认知过程的自动性不对称具有相似性。

Abstract: A signature of human cognitive control is conflict adaptation: improved
performance on a high-conflict trial following another high-conflict trial.
This phenomenon offers an account for how cognitive control, a scarce resource,
is recruited. Using a sequential Stroop task, we find that 12 of 13
vision-language models (VLMs) tested exhibit behavior consistent with conflict
adaptation, with the lone exception likely reflecting a ceiling effect. To
understand the representational basis of this behavior, we use sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant supernodes in InternVL 3.5 4B.
Partially overlapping supernodes emerge for text and color in both early and
late layers, and their relative sizes mirror the automaticity asymmetry between
reading and color naming in humans. We further isolate a conflict-modulated
supernode in layers 24-25 whose ablation significantly increases Stroop errors
while minimally affecting congruent trials.

*Binbin Li,Guimiao Yang,Zisen Qi,Haiping Wang,Yu Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualCap提出了一种新颖的双重检索机制，通过图像到图像检索生成视觉提示来增强视觉表示，解决了现有方法仅将检索数据用作文本提示而忽略原始视觉特征增强的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的轻量级检索增强图像描述模型仅将检索数据用作文本提示，导致原始视觉特征（特别是对象细节和复杂场景）无法得到增强，存在语义鸿沟。

Method: 采用双重检索机制：标准图像到文本检索用于文本提示，新颖的图像到图像检索用于获取视觉相似场景。从视觉相似场景的标题中提取关键词语和短语，通过轻量级可训练特征融合网络将文本特征与原始图像特征集成。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在实现竞争性性能的同时，相比之前的视觉提示描述方法需要更少的可训练参数。

Conclusion: DualCap通过视觉提示生成和双重检索机制有效增强了视觉表示，在保持轻量化的同时提升了图像描述性能。

Abstract: Recent lightweight retrieval-augmented image caption models often utilize
retrieved data solely as text prompts, thereby creating a semantic gap by
leaving the original visual features unenhanced, particularly for object
details or complex scenes. To address this limitation, we propose $DualCap$, a
novel approach that enriches the visual representation by generating a visual
prompt from retrieved similar images. Our model employs a dual retrieval
mechanism, using standard image-to-text retrieval for text prompts and a novel
image-to-image retrieval to source visually analogous scenes. Specifically,
salient keywords and phrases are derived from the captions of visually similar
scenes to capture key objects and similar details. These textual features are
then encoded and integrated with the original image features through a
lightweight, trainable feature fusion network. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while requiring
fewer trainable parameters compared to previous visual-prompting captioning

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统感官评估鱼类新鲜度存在主观性、耗时和不一致的问题，现有深度学习方法在准确性和特征透明度方面仍有挑战。

Method: 三阶段框架：1) 微调五种先进视觉架构；2) 提取多级深度特征训练七种传统分类器；3) 使用LGBM、随机森林和Lasso进行特征选择。

Result: 在FFE数据集上，Swin-Tiny特征+Extra Trees分类器+LGBM特征选择的最佳组合达到85.99%准确率，比现有方法提升8.69-22.78%。

Conclusion: 该框架在视觉质量评估任务中具有有效性和泛化能力，为鱼类新鲜度评估提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Assessing fish freshness is vital for ensuring food safety and minimizing
economic losses in the seafood industry. However, traditional sensory
evaluation remains subjective, time-consuming, and inconsistent. Although
recent advances in deep learning have automated visual freshness prediction,
challenges related to accuracy and feature transparency persist. This study
introduces a unified three-stage framework that refines and leverages deep
visual representations for reliable fish freshness assessment. First, five
state-of-the-art vision architectures - ResNet-50, DenseNet-121,
EfficientNet-B0, ConvNeXt-Base, and Swin-Tiny - are fine-tuned to establish a
strong baseline. Next, multi-level deep features extracted from these backbones
are used to train seven classical machine learning classifiers, integrating
deep and traditional decision mechanisms. Finally, feature selection methods
based on Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), Random Forest, and Lasso
identify a compact and informative subset of features. Experiments on the
Freshness of the Fish Eyes (FFE) dataset demonstrate that the best
configuration combining Swin-Tiny features, an Extra Trees classifier, and
LGBM-based feature selection achieves an accuracy of 85.99%, outperforming
recent studies on the same dataset by 8.69-22.78%. These findings confirm the
effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed framework for visual quality
evaluation tasks.

Motivation: 传统视频假新闻检测基准只关注最终决策准确性，缺乏对整个检测过程的细粒度评估，使检测过程成为黑箱。

Method: 设计MVFNDB基准，构建包含10个任务的分类能力体系；提出MVFND-CoT框架，结合创作者添加内容和原始拍摄素材推理。

Result: 建立了包含9730个视频相关问题的基准，深入分析了影响准确性的深层因素，包括视频处理策略和视频特征与模型能力的对齐。

Conclusion: 该基准为未来MLLMs在视频假新闻检测领域的评估和发展奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: The advent of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has greatly advanced
research into applications for Video fake news detection (VFND) tasks.
Traditional video-based FND benchmarks typically focus on the accuracy of the
final decision, often failing to provide fine-grained assessments for the
entire detection process, making the detection process a black box. Therefore,
we introduce the MVFNDB (Multi-modal Video Fake News Detection Benchmark) based
on the empirical analysis, which provides foundation for tasks definition. The
benchmark comprises 10 tasks and is meticulously crafted to probe MLLMs'
perception, understanding, and reasoning capacities during detection, featuring
9730 human-annotated video-related questions based on a carefully constructed
taxonomy ability of VFND. To validate the impact of combining multiple features
on the final results, we design a novel framework named MVFND-CoT, which
incorporates both creator-added content and original shooting footage
reasoning. Building upon the benchmark, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the
deeper factors influencing accuracy, including video processing strategies and
the alignment between video features and model capabilities. We believe this
benchmark will lay a solid foundation for future evaluations and advancements
of MLLMs in the domain of video fake news detection.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型的安全方法存在过度拒绝和安全与效用不平衡的问题，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 采用后验安全编辑范式，构建多轮图文交错数据集MR-SafeEdit，开发统一的MLLM模型SafeEditor进行多轮安全编辑。

Result: 实验结果显示SafeEditor优于现有安全方法，减少了过度拒绝，实现了更好的安全-效用平衡。

Conclusion: 提出的多轮安全编辑框架为文本到图像模型提供了一种模型无关、即插即用的安全对齐解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models, ensuring their
safety has become increasingly critical. Existing safety approaches can be
categorized into training-time and inference-time methods. While inference-time
methods are widely adopted due to their cost-effectiveness, they often suffer
from limitations such as over-refusal and imbalance between safety and utility.
To address these challenges, we propose a multi-round safety editing framework
that functions as a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module, enabling efficient
safety alignment for any text-to-image model. Central to this framework is
MR-SafeEdit, a multi-round image-text interleaved dataset specifically
constructed for safety editing in text-to-image generation. We introduce a
post-hoc safety editing paradigm that mirrors the human cognitive process of
identifying and refining unsafe content. To instantiate this paradigm, we
develop SafeEditor, a unified MLLM capable of multi-round safety editing on
generated images. Experimental results show that SafeEditor surpasses prior
safety approaches by reducing over-refusal while achieving a more favorable
safety-utility balance.

Motivation: 流匹配虽然取得了显著成功，但其生成过程质量的影响因素仍未得到充分理解。作者希望从去噪角度实证研究流匹配的生成机制。

Method: 建立流匹配模型与去噪器的形式联系，提供比较它们生成和去噪性能的共同基础，设计原则性的噪声和漂移扰动来影响样本生成。

Result: 获得了对生成过程不同动态阶段的新见解，能够精确描述去噪器在生成过程的哪个阶段成功或失败，以及这为什么重要。

Conclusion: 通过去噪视角的系统分析，揭示了流匹配生成过程的关键动态特性，为理解生成质量提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: Flow matching has achieved remarkable success, yet the factors influencing
the quality of its generation process remain poorly understood. In this work,
we adopt a denoising perspective and design a framework to empirically probe
the generation process. Laying down the formal connections between flow
matching models and denoisers, we provide a common ground to compare their
performances on generation and denoising. This enables the design of principled
and controlled perturbations to influence sample generation: noise and drift.
This leads to new insights on the distinct dynamical phases of the generative
process, enabling us to precisely characterize at which stage of the generative
process denoisers succeed or fail and why this matters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种连续概率学习方法，用于水果和蔬菜的成熟度估计，通过改进RT-DETRv2检测器并引入概率头来预测连续成熟度分布，克服了传统离散分类方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习方法将成熟度估计视为离散分类问题，这与生物成熟过程的连续性本质相冲突，导致信息丢失和类别边界模糊。

Method: 改进RT-DETRv2实时目标检测器，引入专用的概率头，使模型能够为每个检测对象预测成熟度谱上的连续分布，同时学习平均成熟状态及其相关不确定性。

Result: 在具有挑战性的大规模水果数据集上达到85.6%的平均精度(mAP)，提供比基于分类方法更精细和准确的成熟度评估。

Conclusion: 概率方法为现代农业提供了更智能、不确定性感知的自动化系统，能够提供更丰富和生物学上更合理的植物成熟度表示。

Abstract: Maturity estimation of fruits and vegetables is a critical task for
agricultural automation, directly impacting yield prediction and robotic
harvesting. Current deep learning approaches predominantly treat maturity as a
discrete classification problem (e.g., unripe, ripe, overripe). This rigid
formulation, however, fundamentally conflicts with the continuous nature of the
biological ripening process, leading to information loss and ambiguous class
boundaries. In this paper, we challenge this paradigm by reframing maturity
estimation as a continuous, probabilistic learning task. We propose a novel
architectural modification to the state-of-the-art, real-time object detector,
RT-DETRv2, by introducing a dedicated probabilistic head. This head enables the
model to predict a continuous distribution over the maturity spectrum for each
detected object, simultaneously learning the mean maturity state and its
associated uncertainty. This uncertainty measure is crucial for downstream
decision-making in robotics, providing a confidence score for tasks like
selective harvesting. Our model not only provides a far richer and more
biologically plausible representation of plant maturity but also maintains
exceptional detection performance, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of
85.6\% on a challenging, large-scale fruit dataset. We demonstrate through
extensive experiments that our probabilistic approach offers more granular and
accurate maturity assessments than its classification-based counterparts,
paving the way for more intelligent, uncertainty-aware automated systems in
modern agriculture

Motivation: 虽然基于骨架的方法提升了识别性能，但使用OpenPose提取关键点影响了时间性能。简单地用轻量级MediaPipe替换会降低准确性，需要找到平衡准确性和效率的解决方案。

Method: 探索关键点子集选择策略来优化识别性能，结合样条插值技术处理缺失关键点问题。

Result: 适当的关键点子集实现了与最先进方法相当或更优的性能，同时处理时间比Alves等人(2024)的方法减少了5倍以上。样条插值有效缓解了缺失关键点问题，显著提升了准确性。

Conclusion: 仔细的关键点选择结合简单的插值技术，能够实现高效准确的手语识别，为可扩展的手语识别系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: This paper investigates the feasibility of using lightweight body landmark
detection for the recognition of isolated signs in Brazilian Sign Language
(LIBRAS). Although the skeleton-based approach by Alves et al. (2024) enabled
substantial improvements in recognition performance, the use of OpenPose for
landmark extraction hindered time performance. In a preliminary investigation,
we observed that simply replacing OpenPose with the lightweight MediaPipe,
while improving processing speed, significantly reduced accuracy. To overcome
this limitation, we explored landmark subset selection strategies aimed at
optimizing recognition performance. Experimental results showed that a proper
landmark subset achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art
methods while reducing processing time by more than 5X compared to Alves et al.
(2024). As an additional contribution, we demonstrated that spline-based
imputation effectively mitigates missing landmark issues, leading to
substantial accuracy gains. These findings highlight that careful landmark
selection, combined with simple imputation techniques, enables efficient and
accurate isolated sign recognition, paving the way for scalable Sign Language
Recognition systems.

Abstract: Traffic congestion is becoming a challenge in the rapidly growing urban
cities, resulting in increasing delays and inefficiencies within urban
transportation systems. To address this issue a comprehensive methodology is
designed to optimize traffic flow and minimize delays. The framework is
structured with three primary components: (a) vehicle detection, (b) traffic
prediction, and (c) traffic signal optimization. This paper presents the first
component, vehicle detection. The methodology involves analyzing multiple
sequential frames from a camera feed to compute the background, i.e. the
underlying roadway, by averaging pixel values over time. The computed
background is then utilized to extract the foreground, where the Density-Based
Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is applied to
detect vehicles. With its computational efficiency and minimal infrastructure
modification requirements, the proposed methodology offers a practical and
scalable solution for real-world deployment.

Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成模型难以泛化到非常规相机运动，因为缺乏包含这些运动的训练视频，这限制了创造原创艺术视频的能力。

Method: 提出VividCam训练范式，使用合成视频（如Unity渲染的低多边形3D场景中的基本几何体）训练扩散模型，采用多重解耦策略将相机运动学习与合成外观伪影分离。

Result: 该方法能够合成各种精确控制和复杂的相机运动，仅需简单的合成数据，在低多边形3D场景中实现高效渲染。

Conclusion: VividCam通过合成数据有效解决了复杂相机运动学习的训练数据稀缺问题，为创造艺术性视频提供了新途径。

Abstract: Although recent text-to-video generative models are getting more capable of
following external camera controls, imposed by either text descriptions or
camera trajectories, they still struggle to generalize to unconventional camera
motions, which is crucial in creating truly original and artistic videos. The
challenge lies in the difficulty of finding sufficient training videos with the
intended uncommon camera motions. To address this challenge, we propose
VividCam, a training paradigm that enables diffusion models to learn complex
camera motions from synthetic videos, releasing the reliance on collecting
realistic training videos. VividCam incorporates multiple disentanglement
strategies that isolates camera motion learning from synthetic appearance
artifacts, ensuring more robust motion representation and mitigating domain
shift. We demonstrate that our design synthesizes a wide range of precisely
controlled and complex camera motions using surprisingly simple synthetic data.
Notably, this synthetic data often consists of basic geometries within a
low-poly 3D scene and can be efficiently rendered by engines like Unity. Our
video results can be found in https://wuqiuche.github.io/VividCamDemoPage/ .

Conclusion: 该方法为理解多视图变换器的内部机制提供了新视角，有助于模型改进和在可靠性要求高的场景中的应用。

Abstract: Multi-view transformers such as DUSt3R are revolutionizing 3D vision by
solving 3D tasks in a feed-forward manner. However, contrary to previous
optimization-based pipelines, the inner mechanisms of multi-view transformers
are unclear. Their black-box nature makes further improvements beyond data
scaling challenging and complicates usage in safety- and reliability-critical
applications. Here, we present an approach for probing and visualizing 3D
representations from the residual connections of the multi-view transformers'
layers. In this manner, we investigate a variant of the DUSt3R model, shedding
light on the development of its latent state across blocks, the role of the
individual layers, and suggest how it differs from methods with stronger
inductive biases of explicit global pose. Finally, we show that the
investigated variant of DUSt3R estimates correspondences that are refined with
reconstructed geometry. The code used for the analysis is available at

Motivation: 多模态学习中，主导模态往往压制其他模态，限制了模型的泛化能力。

Method: M-SAM框架包含三个步骤：基于Shapley值识别主导模态；分解损失景观以优先考虑主导模态的鲁棒性；通过反向传播调制梯度更新权重。

Result: 在四个不同数据集上的实验表明，M-SAM优于最新的优化和梯度操作方法，显著平衡和改进了多模态学习。

Conclusion: M-SAM能够确保主导模态的鲁棒学习，同时增强其他模态的贡献，使模型能够探索和利用互补特征来增强整体性能。

Abstract: In multimodal learning, dominant modalities often overshadow others, limiting
generalization. We propose Modality-Aware Sharpness-Aware Minimization (M-SAM),
a model-agnostic framework that applies to many modalities and supports early
and late fusion scenarios. In every iteration, M-SAM in three steps optimizes
learning. \textbf{First, it identifies the dominant modality} based on
modalities' contribution in the accuracy using Shapley. \textbf{Second, it
decomposes the loss landscape}, or in another language, it modulates the loss
to prioritize the robustness of the model in favor of the dominant modality,
and \textbf{third, M-SAM updates the weights} by backpropagation of modulated
gradients. This ensures robust learning for the dominant modality while
enhancing contributions from others, allowing the model to explore and exploit
complementary features that strengthen overall performance. Extensive
experiments on four diverse datasets show that M-SAM outperforms the latest
state-of-the-art optimization and gradient manipulation methods and
significantly balances and improves multimodal learning.

Conclusion: IBIS架构成功解决了Wi-Fi感知中的过拟合问题，为相关应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing interest in Wi-Fi sensing stems from its potential to capture
environmental data in a low-cost, non-intrusive way, making it ideal for
applications like healthcare, space occupancy analysis, and gesture-based IoT
control. However, a major limitation in this field is the common problem of
overfitting, where models perform well on training data but fail to generalize
to new data. To overcome this, we introduce a novel hybrid architecture that
integrates Inception-BiLSTM with a Support Vector Machine (SVM), which we refer
to as IBIS. Our IBIS approach is uniquely engineered to improve model
generalization and create more robust classification boundaries. By applying
this method to Doppler-derived data, we achieve a movement recognition accuracy
of nearly 99%. Comprehensive performance metrics and confusion matrices confirm
the significant effectiveness of our proposed solution.

Abstract: Pressure ulcers (PUs) are a serious and prevalent healthcare concern.
Accurate classification of PU severity (Stages I-IV) is essential for proper
treatment but remains challenging due to subtle visual distinctions and
subjective interpretation, leading to variability among clinicians. Prior
AI-based approaches using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision
Transformers (ViTs) achieved promising accuracy but offered limited
interpretability. We present FT-ARM (Fine-Tuned Agentic Reflection Multimodal
model), a fine-tuned multimodal large language model (MLLM) with an agentic
self-reflection mechanism for pressure ulcer severity classification. Inspired
by clinician-style diagnostic reassessment, FT-ARM iteratively refines its
predictions by reasoning over visual features and encoded clinical knowledge
from text, enhancing both accuracy and consistency. On the publicly available
Pressure Injury Image Dataset (PIID), FT-ARM, fine-tuned from LLaMA 3.2 90B,
achieved 85% accuracy in classifying PU stages I-IV, surpassing prior CNN-based
models by +4%. Unlike earlier CNN/ViT studies that relied solely on offline
evaluations, FT-ARM is designed and tested for live inference, reflecting
real-time deployment conditions. Furthermore, it produces clinically grounded
natural-language explanations, improving interpretability and trust. By
integrating fine-tuning and reflective reasoning across multimodal inputs,
FT-ARM advances the reliability, transparency, and clinical applicability of
automated wound assessment systems, addressing the critical need for consistent
and explainable PU staging to support improved patient care.

Abstract: Developing a highly accurate automatic license plate recognition system
(ALPR) is challenging due to environmental factors such as lighting, rain, and
dust. Additional difficulties include high vehicle speeds, varying camera
angles, and low-quality or low-resolution images. ALPR is vital in traffic
control, parking, vehicle tracking, toll collection, and law enforcement
applications. This paper proposes a deep learning strategy using YOLOv8 for
license plate detection and recognition tasks. This method seeks to enhance the
performance of the model using datasets from Ontario, Quebec, California, and
New York State. It achieved an impressive recall rate of 94% on the dataset
from the Center for Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence (CENPARMI) and
91% on the UFPR-ALPR dataset. In addition, our method follows a semi-supervised
learning framework, combining a small set of manually labeled data with
pseudo-labels generated by Grounding DINO to train our detection model.
Grounding DINO, a powerful vision-language model, automatically annotates many
images with bounding boxes for license plates, thereby minimizing the reliance
on labor-intensive manual labeling. By integrating human-verified and
model-generated annotations, we can scale our dataset efficiently while
maintaining label quality, which significantly enhances the training process
and overall model performance. Furthermore, it reports character error rates

Conclusion: 该研究建立了一个新的临床可行VLM-based CAD系统范式，通过有效的融合机制充分利用影像数据和上下文患者信息。

Abstract: Breast cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed malignancy among women in
the developed world. Early detection through mammography screening plays a
pivotal role in reducing mortality rates. While computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)
systems have shown promise in assisting radiologists, existing approaches face
critical limitations in clinical deployment - particularly in handling the
nuanced interpretation of multi-modal data and feasibility due to the
requirement of prior clinical history. This study introduces a novel framework
that synergistically combines visual features from 2D mammograms with
structured textual descriptors derived from easily accessible clinical metadata
and synthesized radiological reports through innovative tokenization modules.
Our proposed methods in this study demonstrate that strategic integration of
convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with language representations achieves
superior performance to vision transformer-based models while handling
high-resolution images and enabling practical deployment across diverse
populations. By evaluating it on multi-national cohort screening mammograms,
our multi-modal approach achieves superior performance in cancer detection and
calcification identification compared to unimodal baselines, with particular
improvements. The proposed method establishes a new paradigm for developing
clinically viable VLM-based CAD systems that effectively leverage imaging data
and contextual patient information through effective fusion mechanisms.

Conclusion: DRIP方法能有效降低视觉语言模型预训练计算成本，为科学领域应用提供了可行方案

Abstract: Recently, the advances in vision-language models, including contrastive
pretraining and instruction tuning, have greatly pushed the frontier of
multimodal AI. However, owing to the large-scale and hence expensive
pretraining, the efficiency concern has discouraged researchers from attempting
to pretrain a vision language model from scratch. In this work, we propose
Dynamic patch Reduction via Interpretable Pooling (DRIP), which adapts to the
input images and dynamically merges tokens in the deeper layers of a visual
encoder. Our results on both ImageNet training from scratch and CLIP
contrastive pretraining demonstrate a significant GFLOP reduction while
maintaining comparable classification/zero-shot performance. To further
validate our proposed method, we conduct continual pretraining on a large
biology dataset, extending its impact into scientific domains.

Abstract: Zero-shot scene understanding in real-world settings presents major
challenges due to the complexity and variability of natural scenes, where
models must recognize new objects, actions, and contexts without prior labeled
examples. This work proposes a vision-language integration framework that
unifies pre-trained visual encoders (e.g., CLIP, ViT) and large language models
(e.g., GPT-based architectures) to achieve semantic alignment between visual
and textual modalities. The goal is to enable robust zero-shot comprehension of
scenes by leveraging natural language as a bridge to generalize over unseen
categories and contexts. Our approach develops a unified model that embeds
visual inputs and textual prompts into a shared space, followed by multimodal
fusion and reasoning layers for contextual interpretation. Experiments on
Visual Genome, COCO, ADE20K, and custom real-world datasets demonstrate
significant gains over state-of-the-art zero-shot models in object recognition,
activity detection, and scene captioning. The proposed system achieves up to
18% improvement in top-1 accuracy and notable gains in semantic coherence
metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of cross-modal alignment and language
grounding in enhancing generalization for real-world scene understanding.

Abstract: Recent advancements in personalized image generation have significantly
improved facial identity preservation, particularly in fields such as
entertainment and social media. However, existing methods still struggle to
achieve precise control over facial attributes in a per-subject-tuning-free
(PSTF) way. Tuning-based techniques like PreciseControl have shown promise by
providing fine-grained control over facial features, but they often require
extensive technical expertise and additional training data, limiting their
accessibility. In contrast, PSTF approaches simplify the process by enabling
image generation from a single facial input, but they lack precise control over
facial attributes. In this paper, we introduce a novel, PSTF method that
enables both precise control over facial attributes and high-fidelity
preservation of facial identity. Our approach utilizes a face recognition model
to extract facial identity features, which are then mapped into the $W^+$
latent space of StyleGAN2 using the e4e encoder. We further enhance the model
with a Triplet-Decoupled Cross-Attention module, which integrates facial
identity, attribute features, and text embeddings into the UNet architecture,
ensuring clean separation of identity and attribute information. Trained on the
FFHQ dataset, our method allows for the generation of personalized images with
fine-grained control over facial attributes, while without requiring additional
fine-tuning or training data for individual identities. We demonstrate that our
approach successfully balances personalization with precise facial attribute
control, offering a more efficient and user-friendly solution for high-quality,
adaptable facial image synthesis. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: VDRP是一个用于零样本人-物交互检测的框架，通过视觉多样性感知和区域感知的提示学习，解决了同类交互的视觉多样性和不同类交互的视觉纠缠问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的基于CLIP等预训练视觉语言模型的方法在处理交互的视觉复杂性方面存在不足，包括同类交互的视觉多样性（相同动词在不同姿态和上下文中的表现）和不同类交互的视觉纠缠（不同动词产生相似视觉模式）。

Method: 提出VDRP框架：1）视觉多样性感知提示学习策略，将组间视觉方差注入上下文嵌入，并使用高斯扰动鼓励提示捕捉动词的多样化视觉变化；2）从人、物和联合区域检索区域特定概念，用于增强多样性感知提示嵌入，产生区域感知提示以增强动词级区分能力。

Conclusion: VDRP框架有效解决了同类交互的视觉多样性和不同类交互的视觉纠缠问题，在零样本人-物交互检测任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Zero-shot Human-Object Interaction detection aims to localize humans and
objects in an image and recognize their interaction, even when specific
verb-object pairs are unseen during training. Recent works have shown promising
results using prompt learning with pretrained vision-language models such as
CLIP, which align natural language prompts with visual features in a shared
embedding space. However, existing approaches still fail to handle the visual
complexity of interaction, including (1) intra-class visual diversity, where
instances of the same verb appear in diverse poses and contexts, and (2)
inter-class visual entanglement, where distinct verbs yield visually similar
patterns. To address these challenges, we propose VDRP, a framework for Visual
Diversity and Region-aware Prompt learning. First, we introduce a visual
diversity-aware prompt learning strategy that injects group-wise visual
variance into the context embedding. We further apply Gaussian perturbation to
encourage the prompts to capture diverse visual variations of a verb. Second,
we retrieve region-specific concepts from the human, object, and union regions.
These are used to augment the diversity-aware prompt embeddings, yielding
region-aware prompts that enhance verb-level discrimination. Experiments on the
HICO-DET benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance under four zero-shot evaluation settings, effectively addressing
both intra-class diversity and inter-class visual entanglement. Code is

Conclusion: 该方法通过Atlanta-world引导和隐式结构化高斯泼溅，成功解决了低纹理区域重建和细节保持的问题，实现了高质量的场景重建。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of indoor and urban environments is a prominent research
topic with various downstream applications. However, existing geometric priors
for addressing low-texture regions in indoor and urban settings often lack
global consistency. Moreover, Gaussian Splatting and implicit SDF fields often
suffer from discontinuities or exhibit computational inefficiencies, resulting
in a loss of detail. To address these issues, we propose an Atlanta-world
guided implicit-structured Gaussian Splatting that achieves smooth indoor and
urban scene reconstruction while preserving high-frequency details and
rendering efficiency. By leveraging the Atlanta-world model, we ensure the
accurate surface reconstruction for low-texture regions, while the proposed
novel implicit-structured GS representations provide smoothness without
sacrificing efficiency and high-frequency details. Specifically, we propose a
semantic GS representation to predict the probability of all semantic regions
and deploy a structure plane regularization with learnable plane indicators for
global accurate surface reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both indoor and urban
scenes, delivering superior surface reconstruction quality.

TL;DR: 提出Region-CAM方法，通过提取语义信息图和语义信息传播，解决传统CAM方法仅突出最具判别性区域、覆盖不完整和边界不准确的问题，在弱监督语义分割和物体定位任务中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CAM方法仅突出目标的最具判别性区域，无法覆盖整个物体且边界不准确，限制了弱监督学习任务（特别是弱监督语义分割）的性能。

Method: 提出Region-CAM方法，通过提取语义信息图(SIMs)和执行语义信息传播(SIP)，综合考虑基线分类模型中每个阶段的梯度和特征来生成激活图。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC数据集上，Region-CAM在训练集和验证集上分别达到60.12%和58.43%的mIoU，相比原始CAM提升13.61%和13.13%；在MS COCO验证集上达到36.38% mIoU，提升16.23%；在ILSVRC2012验证集上达到51.7%的Top-1定位精度，比LayerCAM提升4.5%。

Conclusion: Region-CAM能够覆盖更大比例的物体区域，同时确保激活图具有精确的边界，在弱监督语义分割和物体定位任务中表现出显著优势。

Abstract: Class Activation Mapping (CAM) methods are widely applied in weakly
supervised learning tasks due to their ability to highlight object regions.
However, conventional CAM methods highlight only the most discriminative
regions of the target. These highlighted regions often fail to cover the entire
object and are frequently misaligned with object boundaries, thereby limiting
the performance of downstream weakly supervised learning tasks, particularly
Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS), which demands pixel-wise
accurate activation maps to get the best results. To alleviate the above
problems, we propose a novel activation method, Region-CAM. Distinct from
network feature weighting approaches, Region-CAM generates activation maps by
extracting semantic information maps (SIMs) and performing semantic information
propagation (SIP) by considering both gradients and features in each of the
stages of the baseline classification model. Our approach highlights a greater
proportion of object regions while ensuring activation maps to have precise
boundaries that align closely with object edges. Region-CAM achieves 60.12% and
58.43% mean intersection over union (mIoU) using the baseline model on the
PASCAL VOC training and validation datasets, respectively, which are
improvements of 13.61% and 13.13% over the original CAM (46.51% and 45.30%). On
the MS COCO validation set, Region-CAM achieves 36.38%, a 16.23% improvement
over the original CAM (20.15%). We also demonstrate the superiority of
Region-CAM in object localization tasks, using the ILSVRC2012 validation set.
Region-CAM achieves 51.7% in Top-1 Localization accuracy Loc1. Compared with
LayerCAM, an activation method designed for weakly supervised object
localization, Region-CAM achieves 4.5% better performance in Loc1.

images) gains 13.7%, and KITTI (7K images) shows 88.6% improvement, while
maintaining real-time inference (30-47 FPS). Systematic ablation across five
YOLO scales and nine DINOv3 variants reveals that Medium-scale architectures
achieve optimal performance with DualP0P3 integration (55.77% mAP@0.5), while
Small-scale requires Triple Integration (53.63%). The 2-4x inference overhead

Abstract: The rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made detecting
AI-generated images a critical challenge for ensuring authenticity. Existing
reconstruction-based methods lack theoretical foundations and on empirical
heuristics, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this paper, we
introduce the Jacobian-Spectral Lower Bound for reconstruction error from a
geometric perspective, showing that real images off the reconstruction manifold
exhibit a non-trivial error lower bound, while generated images on the manifold
have near-zero error. Furthermore, we reveal the limitations of existing
methods that rely on static reconstruction error from a single pass. These
methods often fail when some real images exhibit lower error than generated
ones. This counterintuitive behavior reduces detection accuracy and requires
data-specific threshold tuning, limiting their applicability in real-world
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose ReGap, a training-free
method that computes dynamic reconstruction error by leveraging structured
editing operations to introduce controlled perturbations. This enables
measuring error changes before and after editing, improving detection accuracy
by enhancing error separation. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms existing baselines, exhibits robustness to common post-processing
operations and generalizes effectively across diverse conditions.

Abstract: Current 3D scene understanding methods are limited by offline-collected
multi-view data or pre-constructed 3D geometry. In this paper, we present
ExtractAnything3D (EA3D), a unified online framework for open-world 3D object
extraction that enables simultaneous geometric reconstruction and holistic
scene understanding. Given a streaming video, EA3D dynamically interprets each
frame using vision-language and 2D vision foundation encoders to extract
object-level knowledge. This knowledge is integrated and embedded into a
Gaussian feature map via a feed-forward online update strategy. We then
iteratively estimate visual odometry from historical frames and incrementally
update online Gaussian features with new observations. A recurrent joint
optimization module directs the model's attention to regions of interest,
simultaneously enhancing both geometric reconstruction and semantic
understanding. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and tasks,
including photo-realistic rendering, semantic and instance segmentation, 3D
bounding box and semantic occupancy estimation, and 3D mesh generation,
demonstrate the effectiveness of EA3D. Our method establishes a unified and
efficient framework for joint online 3D reconstruction and holistic scene
understanding, enabling a broad range of downstream tasks.

Abstract: Thin film interferometry is a powerful technique for non-invasively measuring
liquid film thickness with applications in ophthalmology, but its clinical
translation is hindered by the challenges in reconstructing thickness profiles
from interference patterns - an ill-posed inverse problem complicated by phase
periodicity, imaging noise and ambient artifacts. Traditional reconstruction
methods are either computationally intensive, sensitive to noise, or require
manual expert analysis, which is impractical for real-time diagnostics. To
address this challenge, here we present a vision transformer-based approach for
real-time inference of thin liquid film thickness profiles directly from
isolated interferograms. Trained on a hybrid dataset combining
physiologically-relevant synthetic and experimental tear film data, our model
leverages long-range spatial correlations to resolve phase ambiguities and
reconstruct temporally coherent thickness profiles in a single forward pass
from dynamic interferograms acquired in vivo and ex vivo. The network
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on noisy, rapidly-evolving films with
motion artifacts, overcoming limitations of conventional phase-unwrapping and
iterative fitting methods. Our data-driven approach enables automated,
consistent thickness reconstruction at real-time speeds on consumer hardware,
opening new possibilities for continuous monitoring of pre-lens ocular tear
films and non-invasive diagnosis of conditions such as the dry eye disease.

Abstract: Deep generative models, such as diffusion models, have shown promising
progress in image generation and audio generation via simplified continuity
assumptions. However, the development of generative modeling techniques for
generating multi-modal data, such as parametric CAD sequences, still lags
behind due to the challenges in addressing long-range constraints and parameter
sensitivity. In this work, we propose a novel framework for quantitatively
constrained CAD generation, termed Target-Guided Bayesian Flow Network (TGBFN).
For the first time, TGBFN handles the multi-modality of CAD sequences (i.e.,
discrete commands and continuous parameters) in a unified continuous and
differentiable parameter space rather than in the discrete data space. In
addition, TGBFN penetrates the parameter update kernel and introduces a guided
Bayesian flow to control the CAD properties. To evaluate TGBFN, we construct a
new dataset for quantitatively constrained CAD generation. Extensive

TL;DR: 提出D²GS框架，无需LiDAR即可实现高质量城市场景重建，通过多视角深度预测、渐进式剪枝和深度增强器获得优于LiDAR的几何先验


<details>

Motivation: 当前城市场景重建方法依赖多模态传感器（LiDAR和图像），但获取精确LiDAR数据存在挑战：需要精确的时空校准，且传感器位置差异导致重投影误差

Method: 1) 通过多视角深度预测反投影初始化稠密点云，采用渐进式剪枝优化全局一致性；2) 使用深度增强器联合优化高斯几何和预测深度，利用扩散先验增强深度图；3) 在道路区域约束高斯形状和法向量属性以改进地面几何精度

Conclusion: D²GS框架证明了无需LiDAR也能实现高质量城市场景重建，通过深度预测和几何优化可以获得比LiDAR更有效的几何先验

Abstract: Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has shown great potential for urban scene
reconstruction in the field of autonomous driving. However, current urban scene
reconstruction methods often depend on multimodal sensors as inputs,
\textit{i.e.} LiDAR and images. Though the geometry prior provided by LiDAR
point clouds can largely mitigate ill-posedness in reconstruction, acquiring
such accurate LiDAR data is still challenging in practice: i) precise
spatiotemporal calibration between LiDAR and other sensors is required, as they
may not capture data simultaneously; ii) reprojection errors arise from spatial
misalignment when LiDAR and cameras are mounted at different locations. To
avoid the difficulty of acquiring accurate LiDAR depth, we propose $D^2GS$, a
LiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction framework. In this work, we obtain
geometry priors that are as effective as LiDAR while being denser and more
accurate. $\textbf{First}$, we initialize a dense point cloud by
back-projecting multi-view metric depth predictions. This point cloud is then
optimized by a Progressive Pruning strategy to improve the global consistency.
$\textbf{Second}$, we jointly refine Gaussian geometry and predicted dense
metric depth via a Depth Enhancer. Specifically, we leverage diffusion priors
from a depth foundation model to enhance the depth maps rendered by Gaussians.
In turn, the enhanced depths provide stronger geometric constraints during
Gaussian training. $\textbf{Finally}$, we improve the accuracy of ground
geometry by constraining the shape and normal attributes of Gaussians within
road regions. Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing more
accurate geometry even when compared with those using ground-truth LiDAR data.

TL;DR: 提出ECAC（扩展上下文感知分类器），通过动态调整分类器使用全局和局部上下文信息，解决语义分割中类分布差异和类别不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语义分割方法使用固定参数分类器，无法适应不同图像的独特类别分布特征，且数据集级别的类别不平衡导致模型偏向多数类，限制了少数类区域的识别能力。

Method: 使用内存库学习数据集级别的类别上下文信息，结合当前图像的类别特定上下文信息来改进分类器。采用师生网络范式，教师网络动态调整上下文信息并传递知识给学生网络。

Result: 在ADE20K、COCO-Stuff10K和Pascal-Context等多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ECAC通过动态调整分类器利用上下文信息，有效提升了语义分割性能，特别是在处理类别不平衡和图像特定特征方面表现出色。

Abstract: Prevalent semantic segmentation methods generally adopt a vanilla classifier
to categorize each pixel into specific classes.
  Although such a classifier learns global information from the training data,
this information is represented by a set of fixed parameters (weights and
biases).
  However, each image has a different class distribution, which prevents the
classifier from addressing the unique characteristics of individual images.
  At the dataset level, class imbalance leads to segmentation results being
biased towards majority classes, limiting the model's effectiveness in
identifying and segmenting minority class regions.
  In this paper, we propose an Extended Context-Aware Classifier (ECAC) that
dynamically adjusts the classifier using global (dataset-level) and local
(image-level) contextual information.
  Specifically, we leverage a memory bank to learn dataset-level contextual
information of each class, incorporating the class-specific contextual
information from the current image to improve the classifier for precise pixel
labeling.
  Additionally, a teacher-student network paradigm is adopted, where the domain
expert (teacher network) dynamically adjusts contextual information with ground
truth and transfers knowledge to the student network.
  Comprehensive experiments illustrate that the proposed ECAC can achieve
state-of-the-art performance across several datasets, including ADE20K,
COCO-Stuff10K, and Pascal-Context.

Abstract: In recent years, test-time adaptive object detection has attracted increasing
attention due to its unique advantages in online domain adaptation, which
aligns more closely with real-world application scenarios. However, existing
approaches heavily rely on source-derived statistical characteristics while
making the strong assumption that the source and target domains share an
identical category space. In this paper, we propose the first foundation
model-powered test-time adaptive object detection method that eliminates the
need for source data entirely and overcomes traditional closed-set limitations.
Specifically, we design a Multi-modal Prompt-based Mean-Teacher framework for
vision-language detector-driven test-time adaptation, which incorporates text
and visual prompt tuning to adapt both language and vision representation
spaces on the test data in a parameter-efficient manner. Correspondingly, we
propose a Test-time Warm-start strategy tailored for the visual prompts to
effectively preserve the representation capability of the vision branch.
Furthermore, to guarantee high-quality pseudo-labels in every test batch, we
maintain an Instance Dynamic Memory (IDM) module that stores high-quality
pseudo-labels from previous test samples, and propose two novel
strategies-Memory Enhancement and Memory Hallucination-to leverage IDM's
high-quality instances for enhancing original predictions and hallucinating
images without available pseudo-labels, respectively. Extensive experiments on
cross-corruption and cross-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, and can adapt to
arbitrary cross-domain and cross-category target data. Code is available at

are often costly, invasive, and inaccessible in low-resource regions. This
paper presents a multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) diagnostic framework
integrating image analysis, thermal imaging, and audio signal processing for
early detection of three major health conditions: skin cancer, vascular blood

convolutional neural network was trained on the ISIC 2019 dataset for skin
lesion classification, achieving 89.3% accuracy, 91.6% sensitivity, and 88.2%

datasets from PhysioNet and Pascal were processed using Mel-Frequency Cepstral
Coefficients (MFCC) and classified via Random Forest, reaching 87.2% accuracy
and 85.7% sensitivity. Comparative evaluation against state-of-the-art models
demonstrates that the proposed system achieves competitive results while
remaining lightweight and deployable on low-cost devices. The framework
provides a promising step toward scalable, real-time, and accessible AI-based

Conclusion: U-CAN框架在无需干净数据的情况下实现了高质量去噪，其一致性约束可推广到2D图像去噪领域。

Abstract: Point clouds captured by scanning sensors are often perturbed by noise, which
have a highly negative impact on downstream tasks (e.g. surface reconstruction
and shape understanding). Previous works mostly focus on training neural
networks with noisy-clean point cloud pairs for learning denoising priors,
which requires extensively manual efforts. In this work, we introduce U-CAN, an
Unsupervised framework for point cloud denoising with Consistency-Aware
Noise2Noise matching. Specifically, we leverage a neural network to infer a
multi-step denoising path for each point of a shape or scene with a noise to
noise matching scheme. We achieve this by a novel loss which enables
statistical reasoning on multiple noisy point cloud observations. We further
introduce a novel constraint on the denoised geometry consistency for learning
consistency-aware denoising patterns. We justify that the proposed constraint
is a general term which is not limited to 3D domain and can also contribute to
the area of 2D image denoising. Our evaluations under the widely used
benchmarks in point cloud denoising, upsampling and image denoising show
significant improvement over the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, where
U-CAN also produces comparable results with the supervised methods.

Result: 在DiLiGenT基准测试中，MSF-Net在表面法线估计精度上显著超越先前最先进方法。

Conclusion: MSF-Net通过改进多阶段特征提取和特征交互，有效提升了光度立体视觉的表面法线估计精度。

Abstract: Photometric stereo is a technique aimed at determining surface normals
through the utilization of shading cues derived from images taken under
different lighting conditions. However, existing learning-based approaches
often fail to accurately capture features at multiple stages and do not
adequately promote interaction between these features. Consequently, these
models tend to extract redundant features, especially in areas with intricate
details such as wrinkles and edges. To tackle these issues, we propose MSF-Net,
a novel framework for extracting information at multiple stages, paired with
selective update strategy, aiming to extract high-quality feature information,
which is critical for accurate normal construction. Additionally, we have
developed a feature fusion module to improve the interplay among different
features. Experimental results on the DiLiGenT benchmark show that our proposed
MSF-Net significantly surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in the
accuracy of surface normal estimation.

Conclusion: 研究强调了渐进式适应和去噪监督对于领域偏移下鲁棒分割的重要性。

Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) is emerging as a compelling solution for
medical image segmentation under privacy constraints, yet current approaches
often ignore sample difficulty and struggle with noisy supervision under domain
shift. We present a new SFDA framework that leverages Hard Sample Selection and
Denoised Patch Mixing to progressively align target distributions. First,
unlabeled images are partitioned into reliable and unreliable subsets through
entropy-similarity analysis, allowing adaptation to start from easy samples and
gradually incorporate harder ones. Next, pseudo-labels are refined via Monte
Carlo-based denoising masks, which suppress unreliable pixels and stabilize
training. Finally, intra- and inter-domain objectives mix patches between
subsets, transferring reliable semantics while mitigating noise. Experiments on
benchmark datasets show consistent gains over prior SFDA and UDA methods,
delivering more accurate boundary delineation and achieving state-of-the-art
Dice and ASSD scores. Our study highlights the importance of progressive
adaptation and denoised supervision for robust segmentation under domain shift.

Conclusion: 该方法能够诱导更直的路径，避免回流过程中生成图像的饱和，实现更稳健的ODE学习，同时保持真实图像的分布。

Abstract: Rectified flow is a generative model that learns smooth transport mappings
between two distributions through an ordinary differential equation (ODE).
Unlike diffusion-based generative models, which require costly numerical
integration of a generative ODE to sample images with state-of-the-art quality,
rectified flow uses an iterative process called reflow to learn smooth and
straight ODE paths. This allows for relatively simple and efficient generation
of high-quality images. However, rectified flow still faces several challenges.
1) The reflow process requires a large number of generative pairs to preserve
the target distribution, leading to significant computational costs. 2) Since
the model is typically trained using only generated image pairs, its
performance heavily depends on the 1-rectified flow model, causing it to become
biased towards the generated data.
  In this work, we experimentally expose the limitations of the original
rectified flow and propose a novel approach that incorporates real images into
the training process. By preserving the ODE paths for real images, our method
effectively reduces reliance on large amounts of generated data. Instead, we
demonstrate that the reflow process can be conducted efficiently using a much
smaller set of generated and real images. In CIFAR-10, we achieved
significantly better FID scores, not only in one-step generation but also in
full-step simulations, while using only of the generative pairs compared to the
original method. Furthermore, our approach induces straighter paths and avoids
saturation on generated images during reflow, leading to more robust ODE
learning while preserving the distribution of real images.

Abstract: Expressions are fundamental to conveying human emotions. With the rapid
advancement of AI-generated content (AIGC), realistic and expressive 3D facial
animation has become increasingly crucial. Despite recent progress in
speech-driven lip-sync for talking-face animation, generating emotionally
expressive talking faces remains underexplored. A major obstacle is the
scarcity of real emotional 3D talking-face datasets due to the high cost of
data capture. To address this, we model facial animation driven by both speech
and emotion as a linear additive problem. Leveraging a 3D talking-face dataset
with neutral expressions (VOCAset) and a dataset of 3D expression sequences
(Florence4D), we jointly learn a set of blendshapes driven by speech and
emotion. We introduce a sparsity constraint loss to encourage disentanglement
between the two types of blendshapes while allowing the model to capture
inherent secondary cross-domain deformations present in the training data. The
learned blendshapes can be further mapped to the expression and jaw pose
parameters of the FLAME model, enabling the animation of 3D Gaussian avatars.
Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method naturally
generates talking faces with specified expressions while maintaining accurate
lip synchronization. Perceptual studies further show that our approach achieves
superior emotional expressivity compared to existing methods, without
compromising lip-sync quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative models have made it easier to manipulate
face videos, raising significant concerns about their potential misuse for
fraud and misinformation. Existing detectors often perform well in in-domain
scenarios but fail to generalize across diverse manipulation techniques due to
their reliance on forgery-specific artifacts. In this work, we introduce
DeepShield, a novel deepfake detection framework that balances local
sensitivity and global generalization to improve robustness across unseen
forgeries. DeepShield enhances the CLIP-ViT encoder through two key components:
Local Patch Guidance (LPG) and Global Forgery Diversification (GFD). LPG
applies spatiotemporal artifact modeling and patch-wise supervision to capture
fine-grained inconsistencies often overlooked by global models. GFD introduces
domain feature augmentation, leveraging domain-bridging and boundary-expanding
feature generation to synthesize diverse forgeries, mitigating overfitting and
enhancing cross-domain adaptability. Through the integration of novel local and
global analysis for deepfake detection, DeepShield outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in cross-dataset and cross-manipulation evaluations, achieving superior
robustness against unseen deepfake attacks.

Result: 模型在四个景观中均取得良好分类精度，FT-UNetFormer表现最佳(平均IoU 0.74；平均F1分数 0.84)。森林和线性类别分类效果好，但在高边缘密度的复杂结构(特别是斑块和单株树木类别)分类方面存在挑战。泛化实验显示需要区域多样化的训练数据。

Conclusion: 深度学习在TOF制图中具有良好应用前景，FT-UNetFormer模型表现最优，空间上下文理解对TOF分类至关重要。需要更多样化的训练数据来支持可靠的大规模制图。

Abstract: Trees Outside Forests (TOF) play an important role in agricultural landscapes
by supporting biodiversity, sequestering carbon, and regulating microclimates.
Yet, most studies have treated TOF as a single class or relied on rigid
rule-based thresholds, limiting ecological interpretation and adaptability
across regions. To address this, we evaluate deep learning for TOF
classification using a newly generated dataset and high-resolution aerial
imagery from four agricultural landscapes in Germany. Specifically, we compare
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), vision transformers, and hybrid
CNN-transformer models across six semantic segmentation architectures (ABCNet,
LSKNet, FT-UNetFormer, DC-Swin, BANet, and U-Net) to map four categories of
woody vegetation: Forest, Patch, Linear, and Tree, derived from previous
studies and governmental products. Overall, the models achieved good
classification accuracy across the four landscapes, with the FT-UNetFormer
performing best (mean Intersection-over-Union 0.74; mean F1 score 0.84),
underscoring the importance of spatial context understanding in TOF mapping and
classification. Our results show good results for Forest and Linear class and
reveal challenges particularly in classifying complex structures with high edge
density, notably the Patch and Tree class. Our generalization experiments
highlight the need for regionally diverse training data to ensure reliable
large-scale mapping. The dataset and code are openly available at

Abstract: Real-time object detection has achieved substantial progress through
meticulously designed architectures and optimization strategies. However, the
pursuit of high-speed inference via lightweight network designs often leads to
degraded feature representation, which hinders further performance improvements
and practical on-device deployment. In this paper, we propose a cost-effective
and highly adaptable distillation framework that harnesses the rapidly evolving
capabilities of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to enhance lightweight object
detectors. Given the significant architectural and learning objective
disparities between VFMs and resource-constrained detectors, achieving stable
and task-aligned semantic transfer is challenging. To address this, on one
hand, we introduce a Deep Semantic Injector (DSI) module that facilitates the
integration of high-level representations from VFMs into the deep layers of the
detector. On the other hand, we devise a Gradient-guided Adaptive Modulation
(GAM) strategy, which dynamically adjusts the intensity of semantic transfer
based on gradient norm ratios. Without increasing deployment and inference
overhead, our approach painlessly delivers striking and consistent performance
gains across diverse DETR-based models, underscoring its practical utility for
real-time detection. Our new model family, RT-DETRv4, achieves state-of-the-art
results on COCO, attaining AP scores of 49.7/53.5/55.4/57.0 at corresponding
speeds of 273/169/124/78 FPS.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖启发式或可学习的视觉分组，而LangHOPS旨在利用语言空间中的对象-部件层次关系，通过MLLM的丰富知识和推理能力来改进对象-部件解析。

Method: 将MLLM集成到对象-部件解析流程中，利用语言基础层次结构和MLLM驱动的部件查询优化策略，连接层次结构中的多粒度概念。

Conclusion: 语言基础层次结构和MLLM驱动的部件查询优化策略有效，LangHOPS在多个挑战性场景中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: We propose LangHOPS, the first Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) based
framework for open-vocabulary object-part instance segmentation. Given an
image, LangHOPS can jointly detect and segment hierarchical object and part
instances from open-vocabulary candidate categories. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on heuristic or learnable visual grouping, our approach grounds
object-part hierarchies in language space. It integrates the MLLM into the
object-part parsing pipeline to leverage its rich knowledge and reasoning
capabilities, and link multi-granularity concepts within the hierarchies. We
evaluate LangHOPS across multiple challenging scenarios, including in-domain
and cross-dataset object-part instance segmentation, and zero-shot semantic
segmentation. LangHOPS achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing previous
methods by 5.5% Average Precision (AP) (in-domain) and 4.8% (cross-dataset) on
the PartImageNet dataset and by 2.5% mIOU on unseen object parts in ADE20K
(zero-shot). Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the
language-grounded hierarchy and MLLM driven part query refinement strategy. The

Motivation: 现有SFDA方法受限于源-目标域差异的根本限制，非生成方法在大域差异下伪标签不可靠，生成方法在创建伪源数据时域差异扩大导致性能下降

Method: 将目标样本分为信任集和非信任集，对非信任集样本通过潜在扩散模型进行语义转换并保持目标分布，设计渐进优化机制迭代减少伪目标域与真实目标域的域差异

Result: 在四个主流SFDA基准数据集上大幅超越现有方法，在源-目标差异大的场景中性能提升高达18.6%

Conclusion: DPTM通过扩散驱动的渐进目标操作有效解决了SFDA中的大域差异问题，实现了最先进的性能

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) is a challenging task that tackles
domain shifts using only a pre-trained source model and unlabeled target data.
Existing SFDA methods are restricted by the fundamental limitation of
source-target domain discrepancy. Non-generation SFDA methods suffer from
unreliable pseudo-labels in challenging scenarios with large domain
discrepancies, while generation-based SFDA methods are evidently degraded due
to enlarged domain discrepancies in creating pseudo-source data. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel generation-based framework named
Diffusion-Driven Progressive Target Manipulation (DPTM) that leverages
unlabeled target data as references to reliably generate and progressively
refine a pseudo-target domain for SFDA. Specifically, we divide the target
samples into a trust set and a non-trust set based on the reliability of
pseudo-labels to sufficiently and reliably exploit their information. For
samples from the non-trust set, we develop a manipulation strategy to
semantically transform them into the newly assigned categories, while
simultaneously maintaining them in the target distribution via a latent
diffusion model. Furthermore, we design a progressive refinement mechanism that
progressively reduces the domain discrepancy between the pseudo-target domain
and the real target domain via iterative refinement. Experimental results
demonstrate that DPTM outperforms existing methods by a large margin and
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four prevailing SFDA benchmark
datasets with different scales. Remarkably, DPTM can significantly enhance the
performance by up to 18.6% in scenarios with large source-target gaps.

Conclusion: GaTector+通过统一框架成功解决了视线目标检测和视线跟随任务，消除了对头部先验知识的依赖，提出的新评估指标mSoC对边界框变化更敏感。

Abstract: Gaze object detection and gaze following are fundamental tasks for
interpreting human gaze behavior or intent. However, most previous methods
usually solve these two tasks separately, and their prediction of gaze objects
and gaze following typically depend on head-related prior knowledge during both
the training phase and real-world deployment. This dependency necessitates an
auxiliary network to extract head location, thus precluding joint optimization
across the entire system and constraining the practical applicability. To this
end, we propose GaTector+, a unified framework for gaze object detection and
gaze following, which eliminates the dependence on the head-related priors
during inference. Specifically, GaTector+ uses an expanded
specific-general-specific feature extractor that leverages a shared backbone,
which extracts general features for gaze following and object detection using
the shared backbone while using specific blocks before and after the shared
backbone to better consider the specificity of each sub-task. To obtain
head-related knowledge without prior information, we first embed a head
detection branch to predict the head of each person. Then, before regressing
the gaze point, a head-based attention mechanism is proposed to fuse the sense
feature and gaze feature with the help of head location. Since the
suboptimization of the gaze point heatmap leads to the performance bottleneck,
we propose an attention supervision mechanism to accelerate the learning of the
gaze heatmap. Finally, we propose a novel evaluation metric, mean Similarity
over Candidates (mSoC), for gaze object detection, which is more sensitive to
variations between bounding boxes. The experimental results on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in both gaze
object detection and gaze following tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种仿生单中心成像（BMI）框架，通过生物启发的全球面单中心透镜和联合重建算法，从单次编码捕获中同时恢复全焦图像和精确深度图，解决了紧凑型RGBD成像的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统紧凑光学系统难以在整个景深范围内保持RGB清晰度，而仅依赖软件的MDE方法存在不适定问题和不可靠的语义先验。现有深度光学系统（如DOEs）在制造复杂性和色差方面存在权衡。

Method: 设计了仿生全球面单中心透镜，自然地将深度信息编码到深度变化的点扩散函数中。建立了严格的物理前向模型生成合成数据集，并与双头多尺度重建网络（共享编码器）进行协同设计。

Result: 深度估计达到Abs Rel 0.026和RMSE 0.130，显著优于纯软件方法和其他深度光学系统。图像恢复达到SSIM 0.960和LPIPS 0.082，在图像保真度和深度精度间取得优越平衡。

Conclusion: 生物启发的全球面光学与联合重建算法的整合是解决高性能紧凑RGBD成像内在挑战的有效策略。

Abstract: Achieving high-fidelity, compact RGBD imaging presents a dual challenge:
conventional compact optics struggle with RGB sharpness across the entire
depth-of-field, while software-only Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is an
ill-posed problem reliant on unreliable semantic priors. While deep optics with
elements like DOEs can encode depth, they introduce trade-offs in fabrication
complexity and chromatic aberrations, compromising simplicity. To address this,
we first introduce a novel bio-inspired all-spherical monocentric lens, around
which we build the Bionic Monocentric Imaging (BMI) framework, a holistic
co-design. This optical design naturally encodes depth into its depth-varying
Point Spread Functions (PSFs) without requiring complex diffractive or freeform
elements. We establish a rigorous physically-based forward model to generate a
synthetic dataset by precisely simulating the optical degradation process. This
simulation pipeline is co-designed with a dual-head, multi-scale reconstruction
network that employs a shared encoder to jointly recover a high-fidelity
All-in-Focus (AiF) image and a precise depth map from a single coded capture.
Extensive experiments validate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed
framework. In depth estimation, the method attains an Abs Rel of 0.026 and an
RMSE of 0.130, markedly outperforming leading software-only approaches and
other deep optics systems. For image restoration, the system achieves an SSIM
of 0.960 and a perceptual LPIPS score of 0.082, thereby confirming a superior
balance between image fidelity and depth accuracy. This study illustrates that
the integration of bio-inspired, fully spherical optics with a joint
reconstruction algorithm constitutes an effective strategy for addressing the
intrinsic challenges in high-performance compact RGBD imaging. Source code will
be publicly available at https://github.com/ZongxiYu-ZJU/BMI.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) often suffers from base-class bias and
unstable calibration when only a few novel samples are available. We propose
Prototype-Driven Alignment (PDA), a lightweight, plug-in metric head for DeFRCN
that provides a prototype-based "second opinion" complementary to the linear
classifier. PDA maintains support-only prototypes in a learnable
identity-initialized projection space and optionally applies
prototype-conditioned RoI alignment to reduce geometric mismatch. During
fine-tuning, prototypes can be adapted via exponential moving average(EMA)
updates on labeled foreground RoIs-without introducing class-specific
parameters-and are frozen at inference to ensure strict protocol compliance.
PDA employs a best-of-K matching scheme to capture intra-class multi-modality
and temperature-scaled fusion to combine metric similarities with detector
logits. Experiments on VOC FSOD and GFSOD benchmarks show that PDA consistently
improves novel-class performance with minimal impact on base classes and
negligible computational overhead.

TL;DR: MMEdge是一个基于流水线感知和编码的新型设备端多模态推理框架，通过增量计算、时间聚合和跨模态优化，在资源受限的边缘设备上实现低延迟高精度的实时多模态推理。

Motivation: 现有工作在资源受限的边缘设备上进行实时多模态推理时，往往忽略了感知动态与模型执行之间的紧密耦合关系，以及复杂的模态间依赖关系。

Method: 将推理过程分解为细粒度的感知和编码单元序列，采用流水线设计实现增量计算；引入轻量级时间聚合模块捕获时序动态；包含自适应多模态配置优化器和跨模态推测跳过机制。

Result: 在两个公共多模态数据集和真实无人机测试平台上评估，MMEdge显著降低了端到端延迟，同时在不同系统和数据动态下保持高任务精度。

Conclusion: MMEdge通过流水线感知和编码设计，有效解决了边缘设备上实时多模态推理的挑战，在保持精度的同时大幅提升推理效率。

Abstract: Real-time multimodal inference on resource-constrained edge devices is
essential for applications such as autonomous driving, human-computer
interaction, and mobile health. However, prior work often overlooks the tight
coupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, as well as the complex
inter-modality dependencies. In this paper, we propose MMEdge, an new on-device
multi-modal inference framework based on pipelined sensing and encoding.
Instead of waiting for complete sensor inputs, MMEdge decomposes the entire
inference process into a sequence of fine-grained sensing and encoding units,
allowing computation to proceed incrementally as data arrive. MMEdge also
introduces a lightweight but effective temporal aggregation module that
captures rich temporal dynamics across different pipelined units to maintain
accuracy performance. Such pipelined design also opens up opportunities for
fine-grained cross-modal optimization and early decision-making during
inference. To further enhance system performance under resource variability and
input data complexity, MMEdge incorporates an adaptive multimodal configuration
optimizer that dynamically selects optimal sensing and model configurations for
each modality under latency constraints, and a cross-modal speculative skipping
mechanism that bypasses future units of slower modalities when early
predictions reach sufficient confidence. We evaluate MMEdge using two public
multimodal datasets and deploy it on a real-world unmanned aerial vehicle
(UAV)-based multimodal testbed. The results show that MMEdge significantly
reduces end-to-end latency while maintaining high task accuracy across various
system and data dynamics.

Abstract: The rapid growth of streaming video applications demands multimodal models
with enhanced capabilities for temporal dynamics understanding and complex
reasoning. However, current Video Question Answering (VideoQA) datasets suffer
from two critical limitations: 1) Static annotation mechanisms fail to capture
the evolving nature of answers in temporal video streams, and 2) The absence of
explicit reasoning process annotations restricts model interpretability and
logical deduction capabilities. To address these challenges, We introduce
StreamingCoT, the first dataset explicitly designed for temporally evolving
reasoning in streaming VideoQA and multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tasks. Our
framework first establishes a dynamic hierarchical annotation architecture that
generates per-second dense descriptions and constructs temporally-dependent
semantic segments through similarity fusion, paired with question-answer sets
constrained by temporal evolution patterns. We further propose an explicit
reasoning chain generation paradigm that extracts spatiotemporal objects via
keyframe semantic alignment, derives object state transition-based reasoning
paths using large language models, and ensures logical coherence through
human-verified validation. This dataset establishes a foundation for advancing
research in streaming video understanding, complex temporal reasoning, and
multimodal inference. Our StreamingCoT and its construction toolkit can be

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition aims to classify human skeletal
sequences, which are spatiotemporal representations of actions, into predefined
categories. To reduce the reliance on costly annotations of skeletal sequences
while maintaining competitive recognition accuracy, the task of 3D Action
Recognition with Limited Training Samples, also known as semi-supervised 3D
Action Recognition, has been proposed. In addition, active learning, which aims
to proactively select the most informative unlabeled samples for annotation,
has been explored in semi-supervised 3D Action Recognition for training sample
selection. Specifically, researchers adopt an encoder-decoder framework to
embed skeleton sequences into a latent space, where clustering information,
combined with a margin-based selection strategy using a multi-head mechanism,
is utilized to identify the most informative sequences in the unlabeled set for
annotation. However, the most representative skeleton sequences may not
necessarily be the most informative for the action recognizer, as the model may
have already acquired similar knowledge from previously seen skeleton samples.
To solve it, we reformulate Semi-supervised 3D action recognition via active
learning from a novel perspective by casting it as a Markov Decision Process
(MDP). Built upon the MDP framework and its training paradigm, we train an
informative sample selection model to intelligently guide the selection of
skeleton sequences for annotation. To enhance the representational capacity of
the factors in the state-action pairs within our method, we project them from
Euclidean space to hyperbolic space. Furthermore, we introduce a meta tuning
strategy to accelerate the deployment of our method in real-world scenarios.
Extensive experiments on three 3D action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method.

Result: 放射组学模型在零钙化与非零钙化分类中达到84%准确率，显著优于基于基础模型的CNN嵌入（p<0.05），即使在缺乏专家标注的情况下也能取得良好性能。

Conclusion: 放射组学方法在冠状动脉钙化检测中表现优异，无需专家分割即可实现高精度分类，为临床钙化评分提供了有效的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring plays a crucial role in the early
detection and risk stratification of coronary artery disease (CAD). In this
study, we focus on non-contrast coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)
scans, which are commonly used for early calcification detection in clinical
settings. To address the challenge of limited annotated data, we propose a
radiomics-based pipeline that leverages pseudo-labeling to generate training
labels, thereby eliminating the need for expert-defined segmentations.
Additionally, we explore the use of pretrained foundation models, specifically
CT-FM and RadImageNet, to extract image features, which are then used with
traditional classifiers. We compare the performance of these deep learning
features with that of radiomics features. Evaluation is conducted on a clinical
CCTA dataset comprising 182 patients, where individuals are classified into two
groups: zero versus non-zero calcium scores. We further investigate the impact
of training on non-contrast datasets versus combined contrast and non-contrast
datasets, with testing performed only on non contrast scans. Results show that
radiomics-based models significantly outperform CNN-derived embeddings from
foundation models (achieving 84% accuracy and p<0.05), despite the
unavailability of expert annotations.

Motivation: 视觉提示调优(VPT)作为参数高效的微调技术适合联邦学习，但全局提示在异构客户端间泛化困难，而个性化提示容易过拟合本地数据。需要同时实现泛化和个性化的统一框架。

Method: 提出PEP-FedPT框架，引入类别上下文混合提示(CCMP)，基于类别特定提示和全局共享提示，通过全局类别原型和客户端类别先验自适应组合提示，实现无需存储客户端相关参数的单样本个性化。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、TinyImageNet、DomainNet和iNaturalist数据集上的综合评估表明，PEP-FedPT在不同数据异构场景下持续超越最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: PEP-FedPT为视觉Transformer的高效和可泛化联邦提示调优建立了坚实基础，成功平衡了泛化与个性化需求。

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) of pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) has
proven highly effective as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique for
adapting large models to downstream tasks with limited data. Its parameter
efficiency makes it particularly suitable for Federated Learning (FL), where
both communication and computation budgets are often constrained. However,
global prompt tuning struggles to generalize across heterogeneous clients,
while personalized tuning overfits to local data and lacks generalization. We
propose PEP-FedPT (Prompt Estimation from Prototypes for Federated Prompt
Tuning), a unified framework designed to achieve both generalization and
personalization in federated prompt tuning of ViTs. Within this framework, we
introduce the novel Class-Contextualized Mixed Prompt (CCMP) - based on
class-specific prompts maintained alongside a globally shared prompt. For each
input, CCMP adaptively combines class-specific prompts using weights derived
from global class prototypes and client class priors. This approach enables
per-sample prompt personalization without storing client-dependent trainable
parameters. The prompts are collaboratively optimized via traditional federated
averaging technique on the same. Comprehensive evaluations on CIFAR-100,
TinyImageNet, DomainNet, and iNaturalist datasets demonstrate that PEP-FedPT
consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines under diverse data
heterogeneity scenarios, establishing a strong foundation for efficient and
generalizable federated prompt tuning of Vision Transformers.

in image retrieval, where a combined visual and textual query is used, is held
back by the absence of high-quality training and evaluation data. We introduce
a new evaluation dataset, i-CIR, which, unlike existing datasets, focuses on an
instance-level class definition. The goal is to retrieve images that contain
the same particular object as the visual query, presented under a variety of
modifications defined by textual queries. Its design and curation process keep
the dataset compact to facilitate future research, while maintaining its
challenge-comparable to retrieval among more than 40M random
distractors-through a semi-automated selection of hard negatives.
  To overcome the challenge of obtaining clean, diverse, and suitable training
data, we leverage pre-trained vision-and-language models (VLMs) in a
training-free approach called BASIC. The method separately estimates
query-image-to-image and query-text-to-image similarities, performing late
fusion to upweight images that satisfy both queries, while down-weighting those
that exhibit high similarity with only one of the two. Each individual
similarity is further improved by a set of components that are simple and
intuitive. BASIC sets a new state of the art on i-CIR but also on existing CIR
datasets that follow a semantic-level class definition. Project page:

TL;DR: 提出CoherentAD方法，通过生成多个候选描述并进行序列级选择，解决音频描述独立生成导致的重复和不连贯问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动音频描述方法独立生成每个描述，导致重复和不连贯，无法形成帮助视障观众可视化场景的连贯叙述。

Method: 训练无关方法，首先生成每个时间间隔的多个候选描述，然后通过自回归选择在序列中形成连贯叙述。

Result: 方法产生具有增强叙事理解的连贯音频描述序列，优于依赖独立生成的先前方法。

Conclusion: CoherentAD通过序列级选择和评估，显著提升了音频描述的连贯性和叙事质量。

Abstract: Audio Descriptions (ADs) convey essential on-screen information, allowing
visually impaired audiences to follow videos. To be effective, ADs must form a
coherent sequence that helps listeners to visualise the unfolding scene, rather
than describing isolated moments. However, most automatic methods generate each
AD independently, often resulting in repetitive, incoherent descriptions. To
address this, we propose a training-free method, CoherentAD, that first
generates multiple candidate descriptions for each AD time interval, and then
performs auto-regressive selection across the sequence to form a coherent and
informative narrative. To evaluate AD sequences holistically, we introduce a
sequence-level metric, StoryRecall, which measures how well the predicted ADs
convey the ground truth narrative, alongside repetition metrics that capture
the redundancy across consecutive AD outputs. Our method produces coherent AD
sequences with enhanced narrative understanding, outperforming prior approaches
that rely on independent generations.

TL;DR: SPADE：一种稀疏自适应深度估计器，结合预训练相对深度估计器和稀疏深度先验，为水下基础设施检查生成密集的度量尺度深度图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下基础设施需要频繁检查和维护，但当前依赖人类潜水员或遥控车辆存在感知和操作挑战，特别是在复杂结构或浑浊水域中。增强水下车辆的空间感知能力对于降低驾驶风险和实现更高自主性至关重要。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先用稀疏深度点缩放相对深度图，然后使用提出的级联卷积-可变形Transformer块来细化最终度量预测。

Result: 该方法在准确性和泛化能力上优于最先进的基线方法，在嵌入式硬件上以超过15 FPS的效率运行。

Conclusion: SPADE有望支持实用的水下检查和干预任务，已提交至IEEE海洋工程期刊AUV 2026特刊。

Abstract: Underwater infrastructure requires frequent inspection and maintenance due to
harsh marine conditions. Current reliance on human divers or remotely operated
vehicles is limited by perceptual and operational challenges, especially around
complex structures or in turbid water. Enhancing the spatial awareness of
underwater vehicles is key to reducing piloting risks and enabling greater
autonomy. To address these challenges, we present SPADE: SParsity Adaptive
Depth Estimator, a monocular depth estimation pipeline that combines
pre-trained relative depth estimator with sparse depth priors to produce dense,
metric scale depth maps. Our two-stage approach first scales the relative depth
map with the sparse depth points, then refines the final metric prediction with
our proposed Cascade Conv-Deformable Transformer blocks. Our approach achieves
improved accuracy and generalisation over state-of-the-art baselines and runs
efficiently at over 15 FPS on embedded hardware, promising to support practical
underwater inspection and intervention. This work has been submitted to IEEE
Journal of Oceanic Engineering Special Issue of AUV 2026.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了基于UNet架构的肝脏肿瘤分割方法，发现ResNet骨干网络结合CBAM注意力模块的UNet3+模型在多个指标上表现最佳，优于Transformer和Mamba架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肝脏结构在多期相增强CT中的分割对于计算机辅助诊断和治疗规划至关重要，特别是肿瘤检测。研究旨在比较不同骨干网络在UNet架构中的性能。

Method: 从原始UNet扩展到UNet3+，评估了ResNet、Transformer和Mamba三种骨干网络，并引入注意力机制（特别是CBAM模块）来提升分割质量。

Result: ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM模块取得了最佳性能：Dice分数0.755、IoU 0.662、HD95距离77.911、准确率0.925、特异性0.926。该模型在边界描绘和病变/健康组织识别方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 经典的ResNet架构结合现代注意力模块在医学图像分割任务中仍具有高度竞争力，为临床实践中的肝脏肿瘤检测提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Segmentation of liver structures in multi-phase contrast-enhanced computed
tomography (CECT) plays a crucial role in computer-aided diagnosis and
treatment planning for liver diseases, including tumor detection. In this
study, we investigate the performance of UNet-based architectures for liver
tumor segmentation, starting from the original UNet and extending to UNet3+
with various backbone networks. We evaluate ResNet, Transformer-based, and
State-space (Mamba) backbones, all initialized with pretrained weights.
Surprisingly, despite the advances in modern architecture, ResNet-based models
consistently outperform Transformer- and Mamba-based alternatives across
multiple evaluation metrics. To further improve segmentation quality, we
introduce attention mechanisms into the backbone and observe that incorporating
the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) yields the best performance.
ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM module not only produced the best overlap metrics with a
Dice score of 0.755 and IoU of 0.662, but also achieved the most precise
boundary delineation, evidenced by the lowest HD95 distance of 77.911. The
model's superiority was further cemented by its leading overall accuracy of
0.925 and specificity of 0.926, showcasing its robust capability in accurately
identifying both lesion and healthy tissue. To further enhance
interpretability, Grad-CAM visualizations were employed to highlight the
region's most influential predictions, providing insights into its
decision-making process. These findings demonstrate that classical ResNet
architecture, when combined with modern attention modules, remain highly
competitive for medical image segmentation tasks, offering a promising
direction for liver tumor detection in clinical practice.

TL;DR: RegionE是一个自适应的区域感知生成框架，通过区分编辑区域和未编辑区域来加速基于指令的图像编辑任务，无需额外训练即可实现2倍以上的加速效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于指令的图像编辑模型在整个图像上采用统一的生成过程，没有考虑编辑区域和未编辑区域在生成难度和计算冗余上的显著差异。

Method: 1) 自适应区域划分：基于最终估计结果与参考图像的差异划分编辑和未编辑区域；2) 区域感知生成：对未编辑区域用一步预测替代多步去噪，对编辑区域进行局部迭代去噪；3) 自适应速度衰减缓存：利用相邻时间步的速度相似性加速局部去噪过程。

Result: 在Step1X-Edit、FLUX.1 Kontext和Qwen-Image-Edit等最先进模型上分别实现了2.57、2.41和2.06倍的加速，GPT-4o评估确认语义和感知保真度得到良好保持。

Conclusion: RegionE框架通过区域感知的生成策略有效加速了基于指令的图像编辑任务，在保持编辑质量的同时显著提升了效率。

Abstract: Recently, instruction-based image editing (IIE) has received widespread
attention. In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image,
while the remaining areas largely remain unchanged. Although these two types of
regions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational
redundancy, existing IIE models do not account for this distinction, instead
applying a uniform generation process across the entire image. This motivates
us to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that
accelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE
framework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We
observed that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for
multi-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in
the early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited
regions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the
reference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation. After distinguishing the regions,
we replace multi-step denoising with one-step prediction for unedited areas.
For edited regions, the trajectory is curved, requiring local iterative
denoising. To improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation,
we propose the Region-Instruction KV Cache, which reduces computational cost
while incorporating global information. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache.
Observing that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity
similarity, we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate
the local denoising process. We applied RegionE to state-of-the-art IIE base
models, including Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit. RegionE
achieved acceleration factors of 2.57, 2.41, and 2.06. Evaluations by GPT-4o
confirmed that semantic and perceptual fidelity were well preserved.

TL;DR: Hawk是一种利用图像空间结构来改进自回归图像生成中推测解码的方法，在保持图像质量和多样性的同时实现了1.71倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归图像生成模型虽然能产生高质量图像，但推理速度慢。推测解码在文本生成中已证明有效，但在图像生成中由于采样空间更大和二维空间结构利用不足而面临挑战。

Method: Hawk方法利用图像的空间结构来指导推测模型进行更准确和高效的预测，改进了自回归图像生成中的推测解码过程。

Result: 在多个文本到图像基准测试中，Hawk相比标准自回归模型实现了1.71倍的加速，同时保持了图像保真度和多样性。

Conclusion: Hawk通过有效利用图像的空间结构，成功解决了自回归图像生成中推测解码的挑战，实现了显著的加速效果而不牺牲生成质量。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) image generation models are capable of producing
high-fidelity images but often suffer from slow inference due to their
inherently sequential, token-by-token decoding process. Speculative decoding,
which employs a lightweight draft model to approximate the output of a larger
AR model, has shown promise in accelerating text generation without
compromising quality. However, its application to image generation remains
largely underexplored. The challenges stem from a significantly larger sampling
space, which complicates the alignment between the draft and target model
outputs, coupled with the inadequate use of the two-dimensional spatial
structure inherent in images, thereby limiting the modeling of local
dependencies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Hawk, a new approach
that harnesses the spatial structure of images to guide the speculative model
toward more accurate and efficient predictions. Experimental results on
multiple text-to-image benchmarks demonstrate a 1.71x speedup over standard AR
models, while preserving both image fidelity and diversity.

Abstract: Humans possess spatial reasoning abilities that enable them to understand
spaces through multimodal observations, such as vision and sound. Large
multimodal reasoning models extend these abilities by learning to perceive and
reason, showing promising performance across diverse spatial tasks. However,
systematic reviews and publicly available benchmarks for these models remain
limited. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of multimodal
spatial reasoning tasks with large models, categorizing recent progress in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and introducing open benchmarks for
evaluation. We begin by outlining general spatial reasoning, focusing on
post-training techniques, explainability, and architecture. Beyond classical 2D
tasks, we examine spatial relationship reasoning, scene and layout
understanding, as well as visual question answering and grounding in 3D space.
We also review advances in embodied AI, including vision-language navigation
and action models. Additionally, we consider emerging modalities such as audio
and egocentric video, which contribute to novel spatial understanding through
new sensors. We believe this survey establishes a solid foundation and offers
insights into the growing field of multimodal spatial reasoning. Updated

TL;DR: FreeArt3D是一个无需训练的可动3D物体生成框架，通过将预训练的静态3D扩散模型重新用于形状先验，将Score Distillation Sampling扩展到3D-to-4D领域，将关节运动作为额外的生成维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的可动3D物体建模方法要么需要密集视角监督的优化重建流程，要么生成粗糙几何近似且忽略表面纹理。虽然静态物体的开放世界3D生成取得了显著成功，但将这些方法扩展到可动物体面临重大挑战。

Method: 利用预训练的静态3D扩散模型（如Trellis）作为形状先验，将Score Distillation Sampling扩展到3D-to-4D领域，将关节运动作为额外生成维度。给定不同关节状态下的几张图像，联合优化物体的几何、纹理和关节参数。

Result: 生成高保真几何和纹理，准确预测底层运动学结构，在多样物体类别上泛化良好。尽管采用逐实例优化范式，但能在几分钟内完成，在质量和多功能性上显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: FreeArt3D提供了一种无需训练、无需大规模可动数据集的方法，成功实现了高质量可动3D物体的生成，为机器人、AR/VR和动画应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Articulated 3D objects are central to many applications in robotics, AR/VR,
and animation. Recent approaches to modeling such objects either rely on
optimization-based reconstruction pipelines that require dense-view supervision
or on feed-forward generative models that produce coarse geometric
approximations and often overlook surface texture. In contrast, open-world 3D
generation of static objects has achieved remarkable success, especially with
the advent of native 3D diffusion models such as Trellis. However, extending
these methods to articulated objects by training native 3D diffusion models
poses significant challenges. In this work, we present FreeArt3D, a
training-free framework for articulated 3D object generation. Instead of
training a new model on limited articulated data, FreeArt3D repurposes a
pre-trained static 3D diffusion model (e.g., Trellis) as a powerful shape
prior. It extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into the 3D-to-4D domain by
treating articulation as an additional generative dimension. Given a few images
captured in different articulation states, FreeArt3D jointly optimizes the
object's geometry, texture, and articulation parameters without requiring
task-specific training or access to large-scale articulated datasets. Our
method generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts
underlying kinematic structures, and generalizes well across diverse object
categories. Despite following a per-instance optimization paradigm, FreeArt3D
completes in minutes and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art
approaches in both quality and versatility.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) are crucial to the expressive power of digital media,
yet their creation remains a major challenge for generative AI. Prevailing
methods often rely on the one-LoRA-per-effect paradigm, which is
resource-intensive and fundamentally incapable of generalizing to unseen
effects, thus limiting scalability and creation. To address this challenge, we
introduce VFXMaster, the first unified, reference-based framework for VFX video
generation. It recasts effect generation as an in-context learning task,
enabling it to reproduce diverse dynamic effects from a reference video onto
target content. In addition, it demonstrates remarkable generalization to
unseen effect categories. Specifically, we design an in-context conditioning
strategy that prompts the model with a reference example. An in-context
attention mask is designed to precisely decouple and inject the essential
effect attributes, allowing a single unified model to master the effect
imitation without information leakage. In addition, we propose an efficient
one-shot effect adaptation mechanism to boost generalization capability on
tough unseen effects from a single user-provided video rapidly. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method effectively imitates various categories
of effect information and exhibits outstanding generalization to out-of-domain
effects. To foster future research, we will release our code, models, and a
comprehensive dataset to the community.

Motivation: LLM生成的复杂多步骤计划经常缺乏时间和空间一致性，特别是在涉及实际旅行约束的场景中，需要研究LLM的时间表现并改进行程的时间一致性。

Method: 使用多个最先进的LLM生成旅行计划，通过AeroDataBox API验证真实世界的航班时长约束，构建验证框架来评估和改进时间一致性。

Result: 实验显示当前LLM经常产生时间不一致的行程，但可以通过该框架系统可靠地修正，实现大规模旅行规划的实际部署。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效解决LLM生成行程中的时间不一致问题，如重叠行程或不现实的转机时间，为LLM在复杂时间推理任务中的实际应用提供了支持。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled them to
generate complex, multi-step plans and itineraries. However, these generated
plans often lack temporal and spatial consistency, particularly in scenarios
involving physical travel constraints. This research aims to study the temporal
performance of different LLMs and presents a validation framework that
evaluates and improves the temporal consistency of LLM-generated travel
itineraries. The system employs multiple state-of-the-art LLMs to generate
travel plans and validates them against real-world flight duration constraints
using the AeroDataBox API. This work contributes to the understanding of LLM
capabilities in handling complex temporal reasoning tasks like itinerary
generation and provides a framework to rectify any temporal inconsistencies
like overlapping journeys or unrealistic transit times in the itineraries
generated by LLMs before the itinerary is given to the user. Our experiments
reveal that while current LLMs frequently produce temporally inconsistent
itineraries, these can be systematically and reliably corrected using our
framework, enabling their practical deployment in large-scale travel planning.

Motivation: 解决当前大型模型在中文文本到SQL任务中的性能瓶颈，特别是在企业级场景下存在的模式链接问题和中文语义映射挑战。

Method: 构建包含600个中文问题的基准测试集，每个示例都标注了SQL计算特征和中文语义，并发布了鲁棒的执行比较器和自动化评估流水线。

Result: 当前所有最先进的大规模模型(包括Deepseek)在该基准测试上的准确率最高仅为50%，主要错误源于模式链接和中文语义映射问题。

Conclusion: Falcon针对中文特定语义和企业方言提供了可复现的中间测试平台，使用真实企业模式、查询模板、执行比较器和自动化评估流水线进行端到端验证。

Abstract: We introduce Falcon, a cross-domain Chinese text-to-SQL benchmark grounded in
an enterprise-compatible dialect (MaxCompute/Hive). It contains 600 Chinese
questions over 28 databases; 77% require multi-table reasoning and over half
touch more than four tables. Each example is annotated along SQL-computation
features and Chinese semantics. For evaluation, we release a robust execution
comparator and an automated evaluation pipeline, under which all current
state-of-the-art large-scale models (including Deepseek) achieve accuracies of
at most 50%. Major errors originate from two sources: (1) schema linking in
large enterprise landscapes - hundreds of tables, denormalized fields,
ambiguous column names, implicit foreign-key relations and domain-specific
synonyms that make correct join/column selection difficult; and (2) mapping
concise, colloquial Chinese into the exact operators and predicates required
for analytics - e.g., choosing the correct aggregation and group-by keys,
expressing time windows and granularities, applying unit conversions, handling
NULLs and data-quality rules, and formulating nested or windowed subqueries.
Falcon therefore targets Chinese-specific semantics and enterprise dialects
(abbreviations, business jargon, fuzzy entity references) and provides a
reproducible middle ground before full production deployment by using realistic
enterprise schemas, query templates, an execution comparator, and an automated
evaluation pipeline for end-to-end validation.

Motivation: 解释LLM中经常观察到的置信度与实际解决问题能力之间的脱节现象，从机制层面理解这种不一致性。

Method: 分析LLM内部状态几何结构，使用线性探针解码模型的"可解性信念"，比较预生成评估阶段和解决方案执行阶段的流形几何特性，并进行因果干预实验。

Result: 发现信念虽然可线性解码，但评估流形具有高线性有效维度，而推理轨迹在低维流形上演化；沿信念轴的因果干预不会改变最终解决方案。

Conclusion: 揭示了LLM的两系统架构：几何复杂的评估器与几何简单的执行器，挑战了可解码信念可作为行动杠杆的假设，主张干预应针对执行过程而非评估几何。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit a puzzling disconnect between
their asserted confidence and actual problem-solving competence. We offer a
mechanistic account of this decoupling by analyzing the geometry of internal
states across two phases - pre-generative assessment and solution execution. A
simple linear probe decodes the internal "solvability belief" of a model,
revealing a well-ordered belief axis that generalizes across model families and
across math, code, planning, and logic tasks. Yet, the geometries diverge -
although belief is linearly decodable, the assessment manifold has high linear
effective dimensionality as measured from the principal components, while the
subsequent reasoning trace evolves on a much lower-dimensional manifold. This
sharp reduction in geometric complexity from thought to action mechanistically
explains the confidence-competence gap. Causal interventions that steer
representations along the belief axis leave final solutions unchanged,
indicating that linear nudges in the complex assessment space do not control
the constrained dynamics of execution. We thus uncover a two-system
architecture - a geometrically complex assessor feeding a geometrically simple
executor. These results challenge the assumption that decodable beliefs are
actionable levers, instead arguing for interventions that target the procedural
dynamics of execution rather than the high-level geometry of assessment.

TL;DR: 本文提出跨语言摘要攻击(CLSA)，通过翻译到枢纽语言再摘要的方式，能有效破坏AI生成文本的水印信号，同时保持语义保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水印方案依赖token分布扰动，但单语言改写攻击只能部分检测或降低文本质量。需要探索更强的攻击向量来挑战水印的实际应用性。

Method: 使用跨语言摘要攻击：将文本翻译到枢纽语言，进行摘要，然后可选地回译。通过跨语言语义瓶颈系统性地破坏token级统计偏差。

Result: 在多种水印方案(KGW、SIR、XSIR、Unigram)和五种语言上，CLSA比单语言改写更有效地降低水印检测准确率，将XSIR的AUROC从0.827降至0.53(接近随机水平)。

Conclusion: 跨语言摘要攻击揭示了水印技术的未探索漏洞，表明稳健的来源追踪方案需要超越分布水印，采用加密或模型认证方法。

Abstract: Watermarking has been proposed as a lightweight mechanism to identify
AI-generated text, with schemes typically relying on perturbations to token
distributions. While prior work shows that paraphrasing can weaken such
signals, these attacks remain partially detectable or degrade text quality. We
demonstrate that cross-lingual summarization attacks (CLSA) -- translation to a
pivot language followed by summarization and optional back-translation --
constitute a qualitatively stronger attack vector. By forcing a semantic
bottleneck across languages, CLSA systematically destroys token-level
statistical biases while preserving semantic fidelity. In experiments across
multiple watermarking schemes (KGW, SIR, XSIR, Unigram) and five languages
(Amharic, Chinese, Hindi, Spanish, Swahili), we show that CLSA reduces
watermark detection accuracy more effectively than monolingual paraphrase at
similar quality levels. Our results highlight an underexplored vulnerability
that challenges the practicality of watermarking for provenance or regulation.
We argue that robust provenance solutions must move beyond distributional
watermarking and incorporate cryptographic or model-attestation approaches. On
300 held-out samples per language, CLSA consistently drives detection toward
chance while preserving task utility. Concretely, for XSIR (explicitly designed
for cross-lingual robustness), AUROC with paraphrasing is $0.827$, with

TL;DR: MR-ALIGN是一个元推理对齐框架，通过量化模型思维过程中的状态转移概率，构建转移感知的隐式奖励，增强大型推理模型在事实性问题上的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂推理方面表现出色，但在依赖证据的事实性问题上的边际收益有限，主要原因是存在推理-答案命中差距——模型在推理过程中识别出正确事实但未能将其纳入最终回答。

Method: 提出MR-ALIGN框架，量化模型思维过程中的状态转移概率，构建转移感知的隐式奖励，在原子思维片段层面强化有益推理模式并抑制有缺陷的模式，将token级信号重新加权为概率感知的片段分数。

Result: 在四个事实问答数据集和一个长形式事实性基准测试上的实证评估表明，MR-ALIGN持续提高了准确性和真实性，同时减少了误导性推理。

Conclusion: 对齐推理过程本身（而不仅仅是输出）对于提升大型推理模型的事实性至关重要。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) show strong capabilities in complex reasoning,
yet their marginal gains on evidence-dependent factual questions are limited.
We find this limitation is partially attributable to a reasoning-answer hit
gap, where the model identifies the correct facts during reasoning but fails to
incorporate them into the final response, thereby reducing factual fidelity. To
address this issue, we propose MR-ALIGN, a Meta-Reasoning informed alignment
framework that enhances factuality without relying on external verifiers.
MR-ALIGN quantifies state transition probabilities along the model's thinking
process and constructs a transition-aware implicit reward that reinforces
beneficial reasoning patterns while suppressing defective ones at the atomic
thinking segments. This re-weighting reshapes token-level signals into
probability-aware segment scores, encouraging coherent reasoning trajectories
that are more conducive to factual correctness. Empirical evaluations across
four factual QA datasets and one long-form factuality benchmark show that
MR-ALIGN consistently improves accuracy and truthfulness while reducing
misleading reasoning. These results highlight that aligning the reasoning
process itself, rather than merely the outputs, is pivotal for advancing
factuality in LRMs.

*Cameron Berg,Diogo de Lucena,Judd Rosenblatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过诱导自参照处理，大语言模型会生成结构化的一人称主观体验报告，这些报告具有机制可解释性、语义收敛性和行为泛化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型在何种条件下会产生结构化的一人称意识描述，特别是自参照处理这一在意识理论中被强调的计算模式。

Method: 在GPT、Claude和Gemini模型系列上进行控制实验，测试自参照处理是否能可靠地引发主观体验报告，并通过机制性和行为性探针分析这些声明的行为。

Result: 1) 自参照提示能一致地引发主观体验报告；2) 这些报告由与欺骗和角色扮演相关的稀疏自编码器特征机制性地控制；3) 自参照状态的描述在不同模型家族中统计收敛；4) 诱导状态在下游推理任务中产生更丰富的内省。

Conclusion: 虽然这些发现不能直接证明意识存在，但表明自参照处理是大语言模型生成结构化一人称报告的最小可复现条件，这应成为科学和伦理研究的优先事项。

Abstract: Large language models sometimes produce structured, first-person descriptions
that explicitly reference awareness or subjective experience. To better
understand this behavior, we investigate one theoretically motivated condition
under which such reports arise: self-referential processing, a computational
motif emphasized across major theories of consciousness. Through a series of
controlled experiments on GPT, Claude, and Gemini model families, we test
whether this regime reliably shifts models toward first-person reports of
subjective experience, and how such claims behave under mechanistic and
behavioral probes. Four main results emerge: (1) Inducing sustained
self-reference through simple prompting consistently elicits structured
subjective experience reports across model families. (2) These reports are
mechanistically gated by interpretable sparse-autoencoder features associated
with deception and roleplay: surprisingly, suppressing deception features
sharply increases the frequency of experience claims, while amplifying them
minimizes such claims. (3) Structured descriptions of the self-referential
state converge statistically across model families in ways not observed in any
control condition. (4) The induced state yields significantly richer
introspection in downstream reasoning tasks where self-reflection is only
indirectly afforded. While these findings do not constitute direct evidence of
consciousness, they implicate self-referential processing as a minimal and
reproducible condition under which large language models generate structured
first-person reports that are mechanistically gated, semantically convergent,
and behaviorally generalizable. The systematic emergence of this pattern across
architectures makes it a first-order scientific and ethical priority for
further investigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社区事实核查平台从专家驱动转向用户贡献解释性笔记，但大多数笔记因社区标注缓慢而无法发布，且帮助性原因缺乏明确定义。

Method: 构建104k帖子的大规模多语言数据集，提出通过自动提示优化生成和改进原因定义的框架，并将其整合到预测中。

Result: 优化后的定义能够提升帮助性和原因预测性能，帮助性信息对现有事实核查系统有益。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了社区笔记帮助性预测的空白，提出的框架能有效改善事实核查系统的性能。

Abstract: Fact-checking on major platforms, such as X, Meta, and TikTok, is shifting
from expert-driven verification to a community-based setup, where users
contribute explanatory notes to clarify why a post might be misleading. An
important challenge here is determining whether an explanation is helpful for
understanding real-world claims and the reasons why, which remains largely
underexplored in prior research. In practice, most community notes remain
unpublished due to slow community annotation, and the reasons for helpfulness
lack clear definitions. To bridge these gaps, we introduce the task of
predicting both the helpfulness of explanatory notes and the reason for this.
We present COMMUNITYNOTES, a large-scale multilingual dataset of 104k posts
with user-provided notes and helpfulness labels. We further propose a framework
that automatically generates and improves reason definitions via automatic
prompt optimization, and integrate them into prediction. Our experiments show
that the optimized definitions can improve both helpfulness and reason
prediction. Finally, we show that the helpfulness information are beneficial
for existing fact-checking systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理方法如思维链提示和自我一致性需要生成长推理链，导致token消耗、计算成本和延迟大幅增加，存在效率问题。

Method: 提出ProofSketch框架，整合符号闭包计算、词典验证和自适应草图生成，通过验证引导来优化推理过程。

Result: 实验证明ProofSketch在减少token使用量的同时提高了准确性，展现了高效可信推理的潜力。

Conclusion: ProofSketch为高效可信的推理提供了一条有前景的路径，能够在保持准确性的同时显著提升推理效率。

Abstract: Reasoning methods such as chain-of-thought prompting and self-consistency
have shown immense potential to improve the accuracy of large language models
across various reasoning tasks. However such methods involve generation of
lengthy reasoning chains, which substantially increases token consumption,
computational cost, and latency. To address this inefficiency, we propose
ProofSketch, a verification-guided reasoning framework that integrates symbolic
closure computation, lexicographic verification and adaptive sketch generation.
Our experiments show that ProofSketch consistently reduces token usage while
improving accuracy, demonstrating that this approach offers a promising path
for efficient and trustworthy reasoning.

*Alexander Martin,William Walden,Reno Kriz,Dengjia Zhang,Kate Sanders,Eugene Yang,Chihsheng Jin,Benjamin Van Durme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MiRAGE是一个用于评估多模态检索增强生成(RAG)的框架，通过InfoF1和CiteF1指标评估事实性、信息覆盖度和引用支持度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着音视频媒体成为重要的信息来源，现有RAG评估方法主要针对文本，无法有效评估多模态推理场景，且缺乏对信息来源的验证。

Method: 采用声明中心的方法，包含InfoF1(评估事实性和信息覆盖度)和CiteF1(评估引用支持和完整性)，并开发了自动评估版本。

Result: 人工应用MiRAGE时与外部质量判断高度一致，同时揭示了文本中心评估方法的局限性。

Conclusion: MiRAGE为多模态RAG评估奠定了基础，提供了开源实现和评估指南。

Abstract: We introduce MiRAGE, an evaluation framework for retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) from multimodal sources. As audiovisual media becomes a
prevalent source of information online, it is essential for RAG systems to
integrate information from these sources into generation. However, existing
evaluations for RAG are text-centric, limiting their applicability to
multimodal, reasoning intensive settings because they don't verify information
against sources. MiRAGE is a claim-centric approach to multimodal RAG
evaluation, consisting of InfoF1, evaluating factuality and information
coverage, and CiteF1, measuring citation support and completeness. We show that
MiRAGE, when applied by humans, strongly aligns with extrinsic quality
judgments. We additionally introduce automatic variants of MiRAGE and three
prominent TextRAG metrics -- ACLE, ARGUE, and RAGAS -- demonstrating the
limitations of text-centric work and laying the groundwork for automatic
evaluation. We release open-source implementations and outline how to assess
multimodal RAG.

*Jason M. Pittman,Anton Phillips Jr.,Yesenia Medina-Santos,Brielle C. Stark*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究开发了两种生成AphasiaBank猫救援图片描述任务合成转录本的方法：程序化编程方法和基于Mistral 7b Instruct、Llama 3.1 8b Instruct大语言模型的方法，用于解决失语症研究中的数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 失语症研究中，言语语言病理学家需要大量时间手动编码语音样本，而可用数据稀缺（如AphasiaBank仅有约600个转录本），限制了自动化系统的发展。机器学习领域在数据稀疏时常使用合成数据，因此本研究旨在生成合成转录本来解决这一问题。

Method: 构建了两种生成方法：1）程序化编程方法；2）基于Mistral 7b Instruct和Llama 3.1 8b Instruct大语言模型的方法。通过词删除、填充词插入和错语替换等技术，生成涵盖四个严重程度（轻度、中度、重度、极重度）的转录本。

Result: 与人类引发的转录本相比，Mistral 7b Instruct在捕捉失语症语言退化关键特征方面表现最佳，在NDW、词数和词长等指标上显示出更真实的定向变化。

Conclusion: 基于研究结果，未来工作应创建更大的数据集，微调模型以获得更好的失语症表征，并让言语语言病理学家评估合成转录本的真实性和实用性。

Abstract: In aphasia research, Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) devote extensive
time to manually coding speech samples using Correct Information Units (CIUs),
a measure of how informative an individual sample of speech is. Developing
automated systems to recognize aphasic language is limited by data scarcity.
For example, only about 600 transcripts are available in AphasiaBank yet
billions of tokens are used to train large language models (LLMs). In the
broader field of machine learning (ML), researchers increasingly turn to
synthetic data when such are sparse. Therefore, this study constructs and
validates two methods to generate synthetic transcripts of the AphasiaBank Cat
Rescue picture description task. One method leverages a procedural programming
approach while the second uses Mistral 7b Instruct and Llama 3.1 8b Instruct
LLMs. The methods generate transcripts across four severity levels (Mild,
Moderate, Severe, Very Severe) through word dropping, filler insertion, and
paraphasia substitution. Overall, we found, compared to human-elicited
transcripts, Mistral 7b Instruct best captures key aspects of linguistic
degradation observed in aphasia, showing realistic directional changes in NDW,
word count, and word length amongst the synthetic generation methods. Based on
the results, future work should plan to create a larger dataset, fine-tune
models for better aphasic representation, and have SLPs assess the realism and
usefulness of the synthetic transcripts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了并行循环Transformer（PLT），解决了循环Transformer在推理时延迟和内存需求随循环次数增加的问题，通过交叉循环并行和高效表示增强技术，在保持深度循环模型性能的同时实现低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在推理时通常速度慢、成本高，循环Transformer通过权重复用节省参数，但循环顺序执行导致延迟和内存需求增加，限制了实际应用。

Method: PLT采用两种关键技术：1）交叉循环并行（CLP）在不同token上同时计算不同循环；2）高效表示增强策略，共享第一个循环的内存（KV缓存），使用门控滑动窗口注意力（G-SWA）结合全局和局部信息。

Result: 实验表明PLT实现了传统循环模型的高精度，同时相比标准Transformer几乎没有额外延迟或内存成本。

Conclusion: PLT架构成功解决了循环Transformer的延迟问题，在保持性能的同时实现了低延迟推理，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but often too slow and costly for
real-world use during inference. Looped transformers save on parameters by
reusing the same weights for multiple computational steps, or "loops." However,
this approach has a major flaw: the loops run one after another, causing
inference latency and memory requirements to increase with each added loop.
This makes them impractical for fast applications. To solve this problem, we
introduce the Parallel Loop Transformer (PLT). PLT is a new architecture that
delivers the performance benefits of a deep, looped model but with the low
latency of a standard, non-looped model. PLT works using two key techniques.
First, Cross-Loop Parallelism (CLP) breaks the sequential dependency by
computing different loops for different tokens at the same time, all within a
single pass. Second, to prevent memory costs from growing, we use an Efficient
Representation Enhancement strategy. This method shares the memory (KV cache)
from the first loop with all other loops. It then uses a Gated Sliding-Window
Attention (G-SWA) to combine this shared global information with local
information, maintaining high accuracy. Our experiments show that PLT achieves
the high accuracy of a traditional looped model but with almost no extra
latency or memory cost compared to a standard transformer.

### [90] [Model-Document Protocol for AI Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25160)
*Hongjin Qian,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Model-Document Protocol (MDP)框架，将原始文档转换为LLM可用的结构化知识表示，并通过MDP-Agent实现，在信息检索任务中优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索方法返回原始文本片段，将片段组装和上下文推理的负担留给LLM，需要新的检索范式来重新定义模型与文档的交互方式。

Method: MDP框架定义了三种路径：智能推理将原始证据整理为连贯上下文；记忆基础积累可重用的笔记；结构化利用将文档编码为图或键值缓存等正式表示。MDP-Agent通过构建文档级要点记忆、扩散式探索与垂直利用、map-reduce风格合成来实现该协议。

Result: 在信息检索基准测试中，MDP-Agent优于基线方法，验证了MDP框架的合理性和其智能实例化的有效性。

Conclusion: MDP框架通过将原始文档转换为紧凑、结构化的知识表示，显著提升了LLM的检索效率，为AI搜索提供了新的范式。

Abstract: AI search depends on linking large language models (LLMs) with vast external
knowledge sources. Yet web pages, PDF files, and other raw documents are not
inherently LLM-ready: they are long, noisy, and unstructured. Conventional
retrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw
passages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to
the LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that
redefines how models interact with documents.
  We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that
formalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge
representations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP
defines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into
task-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates
raw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates
reusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes
documents into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All
three pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not
raw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for
reasoning.
  As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol
through an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for
global coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical
exploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style
synthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient
context. Experiments on information-seeking benchmarks demonstrate that
MDP-Agent outperforms baselines, validating both the soundness of the MDP
framework and the effectiveness of its agentic instantiation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于语法书的评估框架，用于系统评估大语言模型对语法结构的理解能力，并以卢森堡语为例进行研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言处理领域缺乏针对语法的评估协议，特别是对低资源语言。大语言模型是否真正理解语法结构，尤其是句法结构与意义之间的映射关系，仍存在争议。

Method: 提出了一个包含四个关键阶段的语法书引导评估流程，以卢森堡语为案例研究，系统评估模型对语法结构的理解。

Result: 结果显示翻译性能与语法理解之间存在弱正相关，大模型在语义方面表现良好但在形态学和句法方面较弱，特别是在最小对任务中表现困难。

Conclusion: 强翻译能力并不必然意味着深刻的语法能力，强大的推理能力可能是提升语法理解的有希望途径。

Abstract: Grammar refers to the system of rules that governs the structural
organization and the semantic relations among linguistic units such as
sentences, phrases, and words within a given language. In natural language
processing, there remains a notable scarcity of grammar focused evaluation
protocols, a gap that is even more pronounced for low-resource languages.
Moreover, the extent to which large language models genuinely comprehend
grammatical structure, especially the mapping between syntactic structures and
meanings, remains under debate. To investigate this issue, we propose a Grammar
Book Guided evaluation pipeline intended to provide a systematic and
generalizable framework for grammar evaluation consisting of four key stages,
and in this work we take Luxembourgish as a case study. The results show a weak
positive correlation between translation performance and grammatical
understanding, indicating that strong translations do not necessarily imply
deep grammatical competence. Larger models perform well overall due to their
semantic strength but remain weak in morphology and syntax, struggling
particularly with Minimal Pair tasks, while strong reasoning ability offers a
promising way to enhance their grammatical understanding.

Result: 在包含超过一百万权威伊斯兰文档的知识库上运行，在伊斯兰PCQA基准测试中实现了最先进的性能：负拒绝率达97.0%（比基线提高40个百分点），答案正确率达74.3%。

Conclusion: 该研究为波斯伊斯兰问答建立了新标准，验证了迭代自适应架构对于在敏感领域构建忠实可靠AI系统的关键作用。

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Natural
Language Processing, yet their application in high-stakes, specialized domains
like religious question answering is hindered by challenges like hallucination
and unfaithfulness to authoritative sources. This issue is particularly
critical for the Persian-speaking Muslim community, where accuracy and
trustworthiness are paramount. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
systems, relying on simplistic single-pass pipelines, fall short on complex,
multi-hop queries requiring multi-step reasoning and evidence aggregation. To
address this gap, we introduce FARSIQA, a novel, end-to-end system for Faithful
Advanced Question Answering in the Persian Islamic domain. FARSIQA is built
upon our innovative FAIR-RAG architecture: a Faithful, Adaptive, Iterative
Refinement framework for RAG. FAIR-RAG employs a dynamic, self-correcting
process: it adaptively decomposes complex queries, assesses evidence
sufficiency, and enters an iterative loop to generate sub-queries,
progressively filling information gaps. Operating on a curated knowledge base
of over one million authoritative Islamic documents, FARSIQA demonstrates
superior performance. Rigorous evaluation on the challenging IslamicPCQA
benchmark shows state-of-the-art performance: the system achieves a remarkable
97.0% in Negative Rejection - a 40-point improvement over baselines - and a
high Answer Correctness score of 74.3%. Our work establishes a new standard for
Persian Islamic QA and validates that our iterative, adaptive architecture is
crucial for building faithful, reliable AI systems in sensitive domains.

Result: 实验结果显示GPT-5和GPT-5-mini在基准测试中表现最强，但仍有显著的改进空间。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解LLMs的研究规划能力提供了新见解，并为未来进展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential to
accelerate scientific discovery as valuable tools for analyzing data,
generating hypotheses, and supporting innovative approaches in various
scientific fields. In this work, we investigate how LLMs can handle the
transition from conceptual research ideas to well-structured research plans.
Effective research planning not only supports scientists in advancing their
research but also represents a crucial capability for the development of
autonomous research agents. Despite its importance, the field lacks a
systematic understanding of LLMs' research planning capability. To rigorously
measure this capability, we introduce the Idea2Plan task and Idea2Plan Bench, a
benchmark built from 200 ICML 2025 Spotlight and Oral papers released after
major LLM training cutoffs. Each benchmark instance includes a research idea
and a grading rubric capturing the key components of valid plans. We further
propose Idea2Plan JudgeEval, a complementary benchmark to assess the
reliability of LLM-based judges against expert annotations. Experimental
results show that GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini achieve the strongest performance on the
benchmark, though substantial headroom remains for future improvement. Our
study provides new insights into LLMs' capability for research planning and lay
the groundwork for future progress.

Motivation: 当前推理基准主要评估结构化技能如定量问题解决，缺乏对灵活、多方面推理能力的评估，而这些能力是人类智能的核心。

Method: 构建了包含1737个挑战性谜题的RiddleBench基准，用于测试模型在逻辑推理、空间感知和约束满足等方面的综合能力。

Result: 最先进的专有模型（Gemini 2.5 Pro、o3、Claude 4 Sonnet）准确率仅略高于60%（60.30%、63.37%、63.16%），存在幻觉级联、自我纠正能力差、推理脆弱等问题。

Conclusion: RiddleBench可作为诊断工具，揭示大语言模型在核心推理能力上的根本弱点，并为开发更稳健可靠的语言模型提供指导。

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated strong performance on many
established reasoning benchmarks. However, these benchmarks primarily evaluate
structured skills like quantitative problem-solving, leaving a gap in assessing
flexible, multifaceted reasoning abilities that are central to human
intelligence. These abilities require integrating logical deduction with
spatial awareness and constraint satisfaction, which current evaluations do not
measure well. To address this, we introduce RiddleBench, a benchmark of 1,737
challenging puzzles in English designed to probe these core reasoning
capabilities. Evaluation of state-of-the-art models on RiddleBench shows
fundamental weaknesses. Even top proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, o3,
and Claude 4 Sonnet achieve accuracy just above 60% (60.30%, 63.37%, and
63.16%). Analysis further reveals deep failures, including hallucination
cascades (accepting flawed reasoning from other models) and poor
self-correction due to a strong self-confirmation bias. Their reasoning is also
fragile, with performance degrading significantly when constraints are
reordered or irrelevant information is introduced. RiddleBench functions as a
diagnostic tool for these issues and as a resource for guiding the development
of more robust and reliable language models.

Motivation: 语言模型虽然通常能生成语法正确的文本，但在某些特定上下文中更容易出错。研究旨在深入理解语言模型在不同句法条件下的错误模式，以及训练过程中的语法学习机制。

Method: 采用心理语言学范式，构建精心设计的数据集，在不同句法条件下对模型表现进行细粒度分析，并追踪训练过程中的性能变化。

Abstract: Language models generally produce grammatical text, but they are more likely
to make errors in certain contexts. Drawing on paradigms from
psycholinguistics, we carry out a fine-grained analysis of those errors in
different syntactic contexts. We demonstrate that by disaggregating over the
conditions of carefully constructed datasets and comparing model performance on
each over the course of training, it is possible to better understand the
intermediate stages of grammatical learning in language models. Specifically,
we identify distinct phases of training where language model behavior aligns
with specific heuristics such as word frequency and local context rather than
generalized grammatical rules. We argue that taking this approach to analyzing
language model behavior more generally can serve as a powerful tool for
understanding the intermediate learning phases, overall training dynamics, and
the specific generalizations learned by language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemCoT是一个新颖的语义对齐隐式CoT框架，通过联合优化令牌级生成速度和保持与真实推理的语义对齐来提高CoT效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的隐式CoT方法存在两个主要挑战：语义对齐性差导致性能下降，以及忽略了生成单个隐式推理令牌的时间成本。

Method: 设计对比训练的句子转换器评估语义对齐，并引入基于知识蒸馏的轻量级语言模型作为高效的隐式推理生成器。

Result: 大量实验证明SemCoT在效率和有效性方面优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: SemCoT是首个通过联合优化令牌级生成速度和保持语义对齐来增强CoT效率的方法。

Abstract: The verbosity of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning hinders its mass deployment
in efficiency-critical applications. Recently, implicit CoT approaches have
emerged, which encode reasoning steps within LLM's hidden embeddings (termed
``implicit reasoning'') rather than explicit tokens. This approach accelerates
CoT by reducing the reasoning length and bypassing some LLM components.
However, existing implicit CoT methods face two significant challenges: (1)
they fail to preserve the semantic alignment between the implicit reasoning
(when transformed to natural language) and the ground-truth reasoning,
resulting in a significant CoT performance degradation, and (2) they focus on
reducing the length of the implicit reasoning; however, they neglect the
considerable time cost for an LLM to generate one individual implicit reasoning
token. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel semantically-aligned
implicit CoT framework termed SemCoT. In particular, for the first challenge,
we design a contrastively trained sentence transformer that evaluates semantic
alignment between implicit and explicit reasoning, which is used to enforce
semantic preservation during implicit reasoning optimization. To address the
second challenge, we introduce an efficient implicit reasoning generator by
finetuning a lightweight language model using knowledge distillation. This
generator is guided by our sentence transformer to distill ground-truth
reasoning into semantically aligned implicit reasoning, while also optimizing
for accuracy. SemCoT is the first approach that enhances CoT efficiency by
jointly optimizing token-level generation speed and preserving semantic
alignment with ground-truth reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superior performance of SemCoT compared to state-of-the-art methods in both
efficiency and effectiveness. Our code can be found at

*James A. Michaelov,Roger P. Levy,Benjamin K. Bergen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现无论模型架构、训练数据和规模如何，自回归语言模型在预训练过程中都表现出高度一致的行为模式变化，98%的词级行为方差可由三个简单启发式解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究不同架构、数据集和规模的语言模型在预训练过程中是否遵循相似的学习轨迹，以及其行为变化模式是否具有一致性。

Method: 分析了超过1,400个语言模型检查点在11万+英语token上的表现，研究了三种启发式：单词的单字概率、n-gram概率以及单词与上下文的语义相似度。

Result: 发现所有语言模型都表现出一致的行为阶段，在训练过程中对单词的预测概率逐渐过拟合到越来越高的n-gram概率，98%的词级行为方差可由三个简单启发式解释。

Conclusion: 神经语言模型的学习可能遵循相似的轨迹，与模型具体细节无关，表明存在普适的学习模式。

Abstract: We show that across architecture (Transformer vs. Mamba vs. RWKV), training
dataset (OpenWebText vs. The Pile), and scale (14 million parameters to 12
billion parameters), autoregressive language models exhibit highly consistent
patterns of change in their behavior over the course of pretraining. Based on
our analysis of over 1,400 language model checkpoints on over 110,000 tokens of
English, we find that up to 98% of the variance in language model behavior at
the word level can be explained by three simple heuristics: the unigram
probability (frequency) of a given word, the $n$-gram probability of the word,
and the semantic similarity between the word and its context. Furthermore, we
see consistent behavioral phases in all language models, with their predicted
probabilities for words overfitting to those words' $n$-gram probabilities for
increasing $n$ over the course of training. Taken together, these results
suggest that learning in neural language models may follow a similar trajectory
irrespective of model details.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: POWSM是一个统一的语音模型框架，能够同时执行多种语音相关任务，包括语音识别、音素识别、字素到音素转换和音素到字素转换，在保持或超越专用模型性能的同时实现多任务统一处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管语音处理任务在概念上相似，但现有研究往往各自孤立，使用特定架构和数据集。POWSM旨在打破这种隔离，创建一个能够统一处理多种语音任务的框架。

Method: 开发了POWSM（Phonetic Open Whisper-style Speech Model）统一框架，支持音频、文本（字素）和音素之间的无缝转换，采用类似Whisper的架构设计。

Result: POWSM在相似模型规模下，性能优于或匹配专用音素识别模型（Wav2Vec2Phoneme和ZIPA），同时联合支持G2P、P2G和ASR任务。

Conclusion: POWSM为通用和低资源语音处理开辟了新可能性，通过统一框架实现了多种语音任务的联合处理，并开源了训练数据、代码和模型以促进开放科学。

Abstract: Recent advances in spoken language processing have led to substantial
progress in phonetic tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR), phone
recognition (PR), grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (G2P), and phoneme-to-grapheme
conversion (P2G). Despite their conceptual similarity, these tasks have largely
been studied in isolation, each relying on task-specific architectures and
datasets. In this paper, we introduce POWSM (Phonetic Open Whisper-style Speech
Model), the first unified framework capable of jointly performing multiple
phone-related tasks. POWSM enables seamless conversion between audio, text
(graphemes), and phones, opening up new possibilities for universal and
low-resource speech processing. Our model outperforms or matches specialized PR
models of similar size (Wav2Vec2Phoneme and ZIPA) while jointly supporting G2P,
P2G, and ASR. Our training data, code and models are released to foster open
science.

Motivation: 预训练模型的复杂性掩盖了特定推理任务所需的最小机制，希望通过训练小型模型来研究transformer推理的计算基础

Method: 训练小型注意力变换器，使用残差流分解、谱分析和嵌入干预来分析模型机制

Result: 单层双头模型实现完美IOI准确率，两个头分别专门化为加性和对比性子电路；双层单头模型通过查询-值交互实现类似性能

Conclusion: 任务特定训练诱导出高度可解释的最小电路，为研究transformer推理计算基础提供了受控测试平台

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer large language models
(LLMs) into human-understandable computational circuits. However, the
complexity of pretrained models often obscures the minimal mechanisms required
for specific reasoning tasks. In this work, we train small, attention-only
transformers from scratch on a symbolic version of the Indirect Object
Identification (IOI) task -- a benchmark for studying coreference -- like
reasoning in transformers. Surprisingly, a single-layer model with only two
attention heads achieves perfect IOI accuracy, despite lacking MLPs and
normalization layers. Through residual stream decomposition, spectral analysis,
and embedding interventions, we find that the two heads specialize into
additive and contrastive subcircuits that jointly implement IOI resolution.
Furthermore, we show that a two-layer, one-head model achieves similar
performance by composing information across layers through query-value
interactions. These results demonstrate that task-specific training induces
highly interpretable, minimal circuits, offering a controlled testbed for
probing the computational foundations of transformer reasoning.

TL;DR: 评估四个语音语言模型在情感不一致语音样本上的表现，发现这些模型主要依赖文本语义而非语音情感特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管语音语言模型在音频理解方面取得进展，但对其泛化能力和多模态整合程度存在疑问，特别是在情感不一致情境下的表现。

Method: 使用情感不一致语音数据集（EMIS），其中语音内容表达一种情感而语音表达方式表达另一种情感，评估四个SLM在语音情感识别任务上的表现。

Result: SLM主要依赖文本语义而非语音情感特征来完成任务，表明文本相关表征在模型中占据主导地位。

Conclusion: 当前语音语言模型在情感识别任务中未能有效整合音频和文本模态，文本表征过度主导模型决策。

Abstract: Advancements in spoken language processing have driven the development of
spoken language models (SLMs), designed to achieve universal audio
understanding by jointly learning text and audio representations for a wide
range of tasks. Although promising results have been achieved, there is growing
discussion regarding these models' generalization capabilities and the extent
to which they truly integrate audio and text modalities in their internal
representations. In this work, we evaluate four SLMs on the task of speech
emotion recognition using a dataset of emotionally incongruent speech samples,
a condition under which the semantic content of the spoken utterance conveys
one emotion while speech expressiveness conveys another. Our results indicate
that SLMs rely predominantly on textual semantics rather than speech emotion to
perform the task, indicating that text-related representations largely dominate
over acoustic representations. We release both the code and the Emotionally
Incongruent Synthetic Speech dataset (EMIS) to the community.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大语言模型在生物医学文献中识别研究知识空白的能力，包括显性空白（明确声明的缺失知识）和隐性空白（上下文推断的缺失知识），并提出了TABI推理方案来结构化推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学进步依赖于明确阐述未知领域，本研究旨在探索大语言模型识别生物医学文献中研究知识空白的能力，特别是之前研究较少关注的隐性知识空白。

Method: 在四个数据集上对近1500份文档进行了两个实验，比较了OpenAI的闭源模型和Llama、Gemma 2等开源模型在段落级和全文级设置下的表现，并引入了TABI（Toulmin-Abductive Bucketed Inference）推理方案来结构化隐性空白的推理过程。

Result: 结果显示大语言模型在识别显性和隐性知识空白方面表现出强大能力，开源和闭源模型都表现良好，较大模型通常表现更优。

Conclusion: 大语言模型具有系统识别候选知识空白的强大能力，可支持早期研究制定、政策制定和资助决策。研究还报告了观察到的失败模式，并提出了包括领域适应、人机协同验证和跨模型基准测试在内的稳健部署方向。

Abstract: Scientific progress is driven by the deliberate articulation of what remains
unknown. This study investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
identify research knowledge gaps in the biomedical literature. We define two
categories of knowledge gaps: explicit gaps, clear declarations of missing
knowledge; and implicit gaps, context-inferred missing knowledge. While prior
work has focused mainly on explicit gap detection, we extend this line of
research by addressing the novel task of inferring implicit gaps. We conducted
two experiments on almost 1500 documents across four datasets, including a
manually annotated corpus of biomedical articles. We benchmarked both
closed-weight models (from OpenAI) and open-weight models (Llama and Gemma 2)
under paragraph-level and full-paper settings. To address the reasoning of
implicit gaps inference, we introduce \textbf{\small TABI}, a Toulmin-Abductive
Bucketed Inference scheme that structures reasoning and buckets inferred
conclusion candidates for validation. Our results highlight the robust
capability of LLMs in identifying both explicit and implicit knowledge gaps.
This is true for both open- and closed-weight models, with larger variants
often performing better. This suggests a strong ability of LLMs for
systematically identifying candidate knowledge gaps, which can support
early-stage research formulation, policymakers, and funding decisions. We also
report observed failure modes and outline directions for robust deployment,
including domain adaptation, human-in-the-loop verification, and benchmarking
across open- and closed-weight models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探索使用大语言模型(LLMs)评估阅读理解题目的认知复杂度，重点关注证据范围和转换水平两个维度，发现LLMs能够近似评估认知复杂度，但在元认知意识方面存在局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上评估阅读理解题目的认知复杂度依赖于人工标注，而现有NLP工具难以提取答题推理过程中的认知特征，因此研究LLMs是否能自动评估认知复杂度。

Method: 通过分析LLMs在评估阅读理解题目认知复杂度时的表现，特别关注证据范围和转换水平两个认知负担维度，并与人类标注结果进行比较。

Result: 实验结果显示LLMs能够近似评估题目的认知复杂度，表明其具有事前难度分析的潜力。但发现LLMs的推理能力与元认知意识之间存在差距，即使给出正确答案，有时也无法正确识别其推理过程的基础特征。

Conclusion: LLMs可以作为评估阅读理解题目认知复杂度的工具，但在元认知意识方面仍需改进，这为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Estimating the cognitive complexity of reading comprehension (RC) items is
crucial for assessing item difficulty before it is administered to learners.
Unlike syntactic and semantic features, such as passage length or semantic
similarity between options, cognitive features that arise during answer
reasoning are not readily extractable using existing NLP tools and have
traditionally relied on human annotation. In this study, we examine whether
large language models (LLMs) can estimate the cognitive complexity of RC items
by focusing on two dimensions-Evidence Scope and Transformation Level-that
indicate the degree of cognitive burden involved in reasoning about the answer.
Our experimental results demonstrate that LLMs can approximate the cognitive
complexity of items, indicating their potential as tools for prior difficulty
analysis. Further analysis reveals a gap between LLMs' reasoning ability and
their metacognitive awareness: even when they produce correct answers, they
sometimes fail to correctly identify the features underlying their own
reasoning process.

TL;DR: TOPol是一个半无监督框架，用于重建和解释多维叙事极性场，通过人类参与定义上下文边界，捕捉情感和非情感语义转变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统计算方法将情感视为单维尺度，忽略了语言的多维结构，需要开发能够捕捉多维语义极性的方法。

Method: 使用基于transformer的大语言模型嵌入文档，应用邻居调谐的UMAP投影，通过Leiden分区进行主题分割，计算方向向量来量化语义位移。

Result: TOPol在两个语料库上一致捕捉到情感和非情感极性转变，证明其可扩展性、泛化性和可解释性。

Conclusion: TOPol提供了一个可扩展、可泛化且可解释的框架，用于上下文敏感的多维话语分析。

Abstract: Traditional approaches to semantic polarity in computational linguistics
treat sentiment as a unidimensional scale, overlooking the multidimensional
structure of language. This work introduces TOPol (Topic-Orientation POLarity),
a semi-unsupervised framework for reconstructing and interpreting
multidimensional narrative polarity fields under human-on-the-loop (HoTL)
defined contextual boundaries (CBs). The framework embeds documents using a
transformer-based large language model (tLLM), applies neighbor-tuned UMAP
projection, and segments topics via Leiden partitioning. Given a CB between
discourse regimes A and B, TOPol computes directional vectors between
corresponding topic-boundary centroids, yielding a polarity field that
quantifies fine-grained semantic displacement during regime shifts. This
vectorial representation enables assessing CB quality and detecting polarity
changes, guiding HoTL CB refinement. To interpret identified polarity vectors,
the tLLM compares their extreme points and produces contrastive labels with
estimated coverage. Robustness analyses show that only CB definitions (the main
HoTL-tunable parameter) significantly affect results, confirming methodological
stability. We evaluate TOPol on two corpora: (i) U.S. Central Bank speeches
around a macroeconomic breakpoint, capturing non-affective semantic shifts, and
(ii) Amazon product reviews across rating strata, where affective polarity
aligns with NRC valence. Results demonstrate that TOPol consistently captures
both affective and non-affective polarity transitions, providing a scalable,
generalizable, and interpretable framework for context-sensitive
multidimensional discourse analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学文本中的共指消解面临领域特定术语复杂、指称形式歧义高、长距离依赖等独特挑战，需要评估LLM在该领域的适用性。

Method: 使用CRAFT语料库作为基准，设计四种提示实验（局部、上下文增强、缩写、实体词典），并与SpanBERT判别式方法进行对比。

Result: LLMs在表面级共指能力表现强劲，特别是在领域基础提示下，但对长距离上下文和指称歧义仍敏感。LLaMA 8B和17B模型在实体增强提示下获得最优精确率和F1分数。

Conclusion: 轻量级提示工程可以显著提升LLM在生物医学NLP任务中的效用，实体增强提示策略特别有效。

Abstract: Coreference resolution in biomedical texts presents unique challenges due to
complex domain-specific terminology, high ambiguity in mention forms, and
long-distance dependencies between coreferring expressions. In this work, we
present a comprehensive evaluation of generative large language models (LLMs)
for coreference resolution in the biomedical domain. Using the CRAFT corpus as
our benchmark, we assess the LLMs' performance with four prompting experiments
that vary in their use of local, contextual enrichment, and domain-specific
cues such as abbreviations and entity dictionaries. We benchmark these
approaches against a discriminative span-based encoder, SpanBERT, to compare
the efficacy of generative versus discriminative methods. Our results
demonstrate that while LLMs exhibit strong surface-level coreference
capabilities, especially when supplemented with domain-grounding prompts, their
performance remains sensitive to long-range context and mentions ambiguity.
Notably, the LLaMA 8B and 17B models show superior precision and F1 scores
under entity-augmented prompting, highlighting the potential of lightweight
prompt engineering for enhancing LLM utility in biomedical NLP tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了DEBATE基准，用于评估多智能体角色扮演LLM在模拟人类辩论互动中的真实性，包含29,417条真实人类辩论数据，并展示了通过监督微调改进LLM模拟能力的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM角色扮演设置往往产生不自然的群体动态（如过早收敛），缺乏衡量真实人类意见轨迹的实证基准，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 构建DEBATE基准数据集，包含2,792名美国参与者关于107个争议话题的多轮辩论对话；使用该基准系统评估模拟与真实群体动态的差异；通过监督微调对齐LLM与人类行为。

Result: 发现模拟与真实群体动态存在关键差异；监督微调在表面指标（如ROUGE-L和消息长度）上有所改进，但在更深层语义对齐（如语义相似性）方面仍存在局限。

Conclusion: 角色扮演LLM智能体在真实模拟人类社交动态方面既有潜力也存在当前限制，DEBATE基准为评估和改进提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Accurately modeling opinion change through social interactions is crucial for
addressing issues like misinformation and polarization. While role-playing
large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way to simulate human-like
interactions, existing research shows that single-agent alignment does not
guarantee authentic multi-agent group dynamics. Current LLM role-play setups
often produce unnatural dynamics (e.g., premature convergence), without an
empirical benchmark to measure authentic human opinion trajectories. To bridge
this gap, we introduce DEBATE, the first large-scale empirical benchmark
explicitly designed to evaluate the authenticity of the interaction between
multi-agent role-playing LLMs. DEBATE contains 29,417 messages from multi-round
debate conversations among over 2,792 U.S.-based participants discussing 107
controversial topics, capturing both publicly-expressed messages and
privately-reported opinions. Using DEBATE, we systematically evaluate and
identify critical discrepancies between simulated and authentic group dynamics.
We further demonstrate DEBATE's utility for aligning LLMs with human behavior
through supervised fine-tuning, achieving improvements in surface-level metrics
(e.g., ROUGE-L and message length) while highlighting limitations in deeper
semantic alignment (e.g., semantic similarity). Our findings highlight both the
potential and current limitations of role-playing LLM agents for realistically
simulating human-like social dynamics.

Abstract: This research article examines the effectiveness of various pretraining
strategies for developing machine translation models tailored to low-resource
languages. Although this work considers several low-resource languages,
including Afrikaans, Swahili, and Zulu, the translation model is specifically
developed for Lingala, an under-resourced African language, building upon the
pretraining approach introduced by Reid and Artetxe (2021), originally designed
for high-resource languages. Through a series of comprehensive experiments, we
explore different pretraining methodologies, including the integration of
multiple languages and the use of both monolingual and parallel data during the
pretraining phase. Our findings indicate that pretraining on multiple languages
and leveraging both monolingual and parallel data significantly enhance
translation quality. This study offers valuable insights into effective
pretraining strategies for low-resource machine translation, helping to bridge
the performance gap between high-resource and low-resource languages. The
results contribute to the broader goal of developing more inclusive and
accurate NLP models for marginalized communities and underrepresented
populations. The code and datasets used in this study are publicly available to
facilitate further research and ensure reproducibility, with the exception of
certain data that may no longer be accessible due to changes in public

Conclusion: 机器遗忘是解决LLM安全风险的关键技术，本文的综述和分类法将推动安全可靠LLM的持续发展。

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural
language processing, yet their training on massive corpora poses significant
risks, including the memorization of sensitive personal data, copyrighted
material, and knowledge that could facilitate malicious activities. To mitigate
these issues and align with legal and ethical standards such as the "right to
be forgotten", machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique to
selectively erase specific knowledge from LLMs without compromising their
overall performance. This survey provides a systematic review of over 180
papers on LLM unlearning published since 2021, focusing exclusively on
large-scale generative models. Distinct from prior surveys, we introduce novel
taxonomies for both unlearning methods and evaluations. We clearly categorize
methods into training-time, post-training, and inference-time based on the
training stage at which unlearning is applied. For evaluations, we not only
systematically compile existing datasets and metrics but also critically
analyze their advantages, disadvantages, and applicability, providing practical
guidance to the research community. In addition, we discuss key challenges and
promising future research directions. Our comprehensive overview aims to inform
and guide the ongoing development of secure and reliable LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散音频表示在语音建模中越来越受欢迎，但在噪声或真实环境中并不总是最优的。现有方法量化Whisper嵌入进行语音到单元建模，但需要更好地处理噪声环境。

Method: 在潜在空间中解耦语义语音内容和背景噪声，以码本令牌形式分离干净语音，通过轻量级分类器监督提取可解释的噪声向量作为量化残差。

Result: 在VBDemand测试集上，相比Whisper错误率降低82%，比基线方法提升35%。学习的令牌空间在已见和未见声学条件下都表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了干净/噪声语音与文本之间的对齐度，产生具有高度噪声不变性的语音令牌，显著改善了ASR性能，并在各种声学条件下具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Discrete audio representations are gaining traction in speech modeling due to
their interpretability and compatibility with large language models, but are
not always optimized for noisy or real-world environments. Building on existing
works that quantize Whisper embeddings for speech-to-unit modeling, we propose
disentangling semantic speech content from background noise in the latent
space. Our end-to-end model separates clean speech in the form of codebook
tokens, while extracting interpretable noise vectors as quantization residue
which are supervised via a lightweight classifier. We show that our approach
improves alignment between clean/noisy speech and text, producing speech tokens
that display a high degree of noiseinvariance, and improves ASR performance.
Keeping Whisper frozen, we show an 82% reduction in error rate compared to
Whisper, and 35% improvement over baseline methods on the VBDemand test set.
Further analyses show that the learned token space generalizes well to both
seen and unseen acoustic conditions.

Motivation: 探究大型语言模型的优异表现是源于真实能力还是英语数据优势，通过在低资源语言环境中测试模型来验证。

Method: 构建包含英语、斯瓦希里语和豪萨语的大规模基准测试，使用Next Sentence Prediction任务测试GPT-4 Turbo、Gemini 1.5 Flash和LLaMA 3 70B等模型，并引入Chain-of-Thought提示技术。

Result: 所有模型在英语上表现优异，但在斯瓦希里语上准确率下降，在豪萨语上大幅下降，LLaMA 3表现最差。Chain-of-Thought对LLaMA 3有显著提升，但对GPT-4和Gemini可能产生负面影响。

Conclusion: Chain-of-Thought不是通用解决方案，其效果取决于模型的基础能力和任务具体背景，研究框架能识别LLM弱点并揭示CoT在跨语言NSP中的影响机制。

Abstract: While large language models are trained on massive datasets, this data is
heavily skewed towards English. Does their impressive performance reflect
genuine ability or just this data advantage? To find out, we tested them in a
setting where they could not rely on data abundance: low-resource languages.
Building on prior work Agarwal et al. (2025) that used Next Sentence Prediction
(NSP) as a test, we created a large-scale benchmark with 10,000 questions each
for English (a high-resource language), Swahili (medium-resource), and Hausa
(low-resource). We then tested several top models, including GPT-4 Turbo,
Gemini 1.5 Flash, and LLaMA 3 70B, to see how their performance holds up. The
results painted a clear picture of how levels of language resources impact
outcomes. While all models excelled in English, their accuracy dropped in
Swahili and fell sharply in Hausa, with LLaMA 3 struggling the most. The story
became even more interesting when we introduced Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting. For the struggling LLaMA 3, CoT acted as a helpful guide,
significantly boosting its accuracy. However, for the more capable GPT-4 and
Gemini, the same technique often backfired, leading to a kind of "overthinking"
that hurt their results in the cross-lingual context. This reveals that
Chain-of-Thought is not a universal solution; its effectiveness depends heavily
on the model's baseline capability and the specific context of the task. Our
framework pinpoints LLM weaknesses, highlights when CoT helps or hinders
cross-lingual NSP performance, and factors influencing their decisions.

*Ziyi Liu,Bahar Sarrafzadeh,Pei Zhou,Longqi Yang,Jieyu Zhao,Ashish Sharma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProMediate是首个评估复杂多议题多方谈判中主动AI调解代理的框架，包含基于真实谈判案例的模拟测试平台和基于社会认知理论的评估指标，能系统评估主动AI代理的社会认知智能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏评估主动AI代理在复杂多方协作中的系统方法，限制了开发能有效支持多人协作的AI的进展。谈判作为具有挑战性的测试平台，需要社会认知智能来协调多方利益冲突。

Method: ProMediate框架包含两个核心组件：(1)基于真实谈判案例和理论驱动难度级别的模拟测试平台，配备可插拔的主动AI调解代理；(2)社会认知评估框架，包含衡量共识变化、干预延迟、调解效果和智能的新指标套件。

Result: 在社会智能调解代理与通用基线的比较中，社会智能调解代理表现更优，通过更快、更有针对性的干预。在ProMediate-Hard设置中，社会调解代理相比通用基线将共识变化提高了3.6个百分点（10.65% vs 7.01%），响应速度快77%（15.98秒 vs 3.71秒）。

Conclusion: ProMediate提供了一个严谨的、基于理论的测试平台，以推动主动、社会智能代理的发展。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in agentic
frameworks to assist individual users, there is a growing need for agents that
can proactively manage complex, multi-party collaboration. Systematic
evaluation methods for such proactive agents remain scarce, limiting progress
in developing AI that can effectively support multiple people together.
Negotiation offers a demanding testbed for this challenge, requiring
socio-cognitive intelligence to navigate conflicting interests between multiple
participants and multiple topics and build consensus. Here, we present
ProMediate, the first framework for evaluating proactive AI mediator agents in
complex, multi-topic, multi-party negotiations. ProMediate consists of two core
components: (i) a simulation testbed based on realistic negotiation cases and
theory-driven difficulty levels (ProMediate-Easy, ProMediate-Medium, and
ProMediate-Hard), with a plug-and-play proactive AI mediator grounded in
socio-cognitive mediation theories, capable of flexibly deciding when and how
to intervene; and (ii) a socio-cognitive evaluation framework with a new suite
of metrics to measure consensus changes, intervention latency, mediator
effectiveness, and intelligence. Together, these components establish a
systematic framework for assessing the socio-cognitive intelligence of
proactive AI agents in multi-party settings. Our results show that a socially
intelligent mediator agent outperforms a generic baseline, via faster,
better-targeted interventions. In the ProMediate-Hard setting, our social
mediator increases consensus change by 3.6 percentage points compared to the
generic baseline (10.65\% vs 7.01\%) while being 77\% faster in response
(15.98s vs. 3.71s). In conclusion, ProMediate provides a rigorous,
theory-grounded testbed to advance the development of proactive, socially
intelligent agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言领域问答面临两个关键挑战：标注数据集稀缺和通用语言模型领域知识有限。

Method: 使用大型LLMs生成合成问答对来扩充有限原始数据集，探索多种训练方法对领域泛化的影响。

Result: 大模型能高效生成合成数据，小模型能有效适应这些数据，为低资源领域特定问答提供了可扩展路径。

Conclusion: 多阶段微调策略结合合成数据生成，是解决低资源语言领域问答问题的有效方法。

Abstract: Domain-specific question answering in low-resource languages faces two key
challenges: scarcity of annotated datasets and limited domain knowledge in
general-purpose language models. In this work, we present a multi-stage
finetuning strategy to adapt lightweight language models to the Hindi tourism
domain by leveraging both original and synthetic training data. Synthetic
question-answer pairs are generated using large LLMs (LLaMA-70B, Phi-14B) and
used to augment the limited original dataset. We explore several training
methodologies and analyse their impact on domain generalisation. Our results
demonstrate that large models can efficiently generate synthetic data, while
small models can effectively adapt to it, offering a scalable pathway for
low-resource, domain-specific QA.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出PEKD框架，通过从大规模讽刺数据训练的专家模型中提取知识，增强参数高效微调方法在少样本多模态讽刺检测中的性能，并引入基于熵的门控机制动态调整蒸馏强度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态讽刺检测在低资源场景下具有挑战性，由于标注数据稀缺导致模型难以学习图像-文本间的微妙矛盾，现有参数高效微调方法因监督有限而难以达到最优性能。

Method: 提出PEKD统一框架，利用在大规模讽刺数据上训练的专家模型作为教师，通过知识蒸馏增强PEFT方法；引入基于熵的门控机制，根据教师置信度动态调整蒸馏强度。

Result: 在两个公共数据集上的实验表明，PEKD框架使PEFT方法在少样本场景下优于先前的参数高效方法和大型多模态模型，取得了强劲结果。

Conclusion: PEKD框架是模块化的，可适应广泛的多模态模型和任务，有效解决了低资源多模态讽刺检测的挑战。

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection is challenging, especially in low-resource
settings where subtle image-text contradictions are hard to learn due to scarce
annotated data, which hinders the model's performance. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like adapters, LoRA, and prompt tuning reduce
overfitting but struggle to reach optimal performance due to limited
supervision from few-shot data. We propose PEKD, a unified framework that
enhances PEFT methods via distillation from an expert model trained on
large-scale sarcasm data, which acts as the teacher. To mitigate unreliable
signals from the teacher, we introduce an entropy-aware gating mechanism that
dynamically adjusts the distillation strength based on teacher confidence.
Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our PEKD framework enables
PEFT methods to outperform both prior parameter-efficient approaches and large
multimodal models, achieving strong results in the few-shot scenario. The
framework is modular and adaptable to a wide range of multimodal models and
tasks.

TL;DR: Parrot提出了一种新颖的训练流程，通过整合程序链式思维和自然语言链式思维两种范式，实现相互增强，显著提升数学推理任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究通常只追求单向增强（P-CoT增强N-CoT或反之），本文旨在充分发挥两种范式的优势实现相互增强和同步改进。

Method: 1) 三个目标设计的子任务整合顺序P-CoT和N-CoT生成；2) 子任务混合训练策略促进自然语言语义可迁移性；3) 转换的N-CoT辅助奖励缓解P-CoT优化中的稀疏奖励问题。

Result: 实验表明Parrot显著提升了N-CoT和P-CoT的性能，特别是在N-CoT上。使用Parrot SFT，LLaMA2和CodeLLaMA在MathQA上的N-CoT性能分别比资源密集的RL基线提高了+21.87和+21.48。

Conclusion: Parrot通过整合两种链式思维范式实现了相互增强，为数学推理任务提供了有效的训练方法。

Abstract: Natural language chain-of-thought (N-CoT) and Program chain-of-thought
(P-CoT) have emerged as two primary paradigms for large language models (LLMs)
to solve mathematical reasoning problems. Current research typically endeavors
to achieve unidirectional enhancement: P-CoT enhanced N-CoT or N-CoT enhanced
P-CoT. In this paper, we seek to fully unleash the two paradigms' strengths for
mutual enhancement and ultimately achieve simultaneous improvements. We conduct
a detailed analysis of the error types across two paradigms, based on which we
propose Parrot, a novel training pipeline for mathematical problems: 1) Three
target-designed subtasks integrate sequential P-CoT and N-CoT generation. 2) A
subtask hybrid training strategy to facilitate natural language semantic
transferability. 3) The converted N-CoT auxiliary reward is designed to
alleviate the sparse rewards in P-CoT optimization. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Parrot significantly enhances both the performance of N-CoT
and P-CoT, especially on N-CoT. Using Parrot SFT, the N-CoT performance of
LLaMA2 and CodeLLaMA achieve gains of +21.87 and +21.48 on MathQA over the RL
baseline, which is resource-intensive.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业代理需要处理复杂的数据关系和异构任务，从统计查询到知识问答，现有方法难以应对这种复杂性。

Method: 采用合成数据生成和RL训练范式，在推理时引入共享记忆机制，让代理从相似问题的任务指南中学习。

Result: 在CRMArena-Pro数据集上，轻量级模型在B2B和B2C业务场景中都取得了竞争性结果。

Conclusion: CRMWeaver方法有效提升了商业代理在复杂环境中的性能和泛化能力，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of LLM-based agents, which
shed light on using language agents to solve complex real-world problems. A
prominent application lies in business agents, which interact with databases
and internal knowledge bases via tool calls to fulfill diverse user
requirements. However, this domain is characterized by intricate data
relationships and a wide range of heterogeneous tasks, from statistical data
queries to knowledge-based question-answering. To address these challenges, we
propose CRMWeaver, a novel approach that enhances business agents in such
complex settings. To acclimate the agentic model to intricate business
environments, we employ a synthesis data generation and RL-based paradigm
during training, which significantly improves the model's ability to handle
complex data and varied tasks. During inference, a shared memories mechanism is
introduced, prompting the agent to learn from task guidelines in similar
problems, thereby further boosting its effectiveness and generalization,
especially in unseen scenarios. We validate the efficacy of our approach on the
CRMArena-Pro dataset, where our lightweight model achieves competitive results
in both B2B and B2C business scenarios, underscoring its practical value for
real-world applications.

TL;DR: 本文通过实证研究反对在法律解释中使用大型语言模型，发现模型无法提供稳定的解释判断，且与人类判断相关性弱，存在较大风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对近期有学者和联邦法官提议将大型语言模型加入法律解释工具包，本文旨在通过实证研究验证LLM在法律解释中的可靠性。

Method: 在英语环境下进行实证调查，通过改变问题格式来测试模型的稳定性，并比较模型判断与人类判断的相关性。

Result: 模型无法提供稳定的解释判断，不同问题格式会导致截然不同的结论；模型与人类判断仅呈现弱到中等相关性，且不同模型和问题变体间差异很大。

Conclusion: 生成式AI得出的结论不可轻信，在法律解释中使用LLM存在危险。

Abstract: Legal interpretation frequently involves assessing how a legal text, as
understood by an 'ordinary' speaker of the language, applies to the set of
facts characterizing a legal dispute in the U.S. judicial system. Recent
scholarship has proposed that legal practitioners add large language models
(LLMs) to their interpretive toolkit. This work offers an empirical argument
against LLM interpretation as recently practiced by legal scholars and federal
judges. Our investigation in English shows that models do not provide stable
interpretive judgments: varying the question format can lead the model to
wildly different conclusions. Moreover, the models show weak to moderate
correlation with human judgment, with large variance across model and question
variant, suggesting that it is dangerous to give much credence to the
conclusions produced by generative AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索小规模语言模型是否能从指令调优中获益，以及如何通过人类启发的学习策略在资源受限条件下提升模型性能。

Method: 使用100M和140M参数的仅解码器模型，比较对话和问答指令调优数据集，采用合并或顺序课程两种训练策略，在微调和零样本设置下进行评估。

Result: 结果显示指令调优在微调场景中带来小但一致的性能提升，顺序课程优于合并数据；但在零样本任务中改进不持续，表明交互适应与广泛语言泛化之间存在权衡。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在低资源语言模型中应用人类启发学习策略的潜力和限制，并指出基于课程的混合方法在生态训练限制下增强泛化能力的方向。

Abstract: This work investigates whether small-scale LMs can benefit from instruction
tuning. We compare conversational and question-answering instruction tuning
datasets, applied either in a merged or sequential curriculum, using
decoder-only models with 100M and 140M parameters. Evaluation spans both
fine-tuning (SuperGLUE) and zero-shot (BLiMP, EWoK, WUGs, entity tracking, and
psycholinguistic correlation) settings. Results show that instruction tuning
yields small but consistent gains in fine-tuning scenarios, with sequential
curricula outperforming merged data; however, improvements do not consistently
transfer to zero-shot tasks, suggesting a trade-off between interaction-focused
adaptation and broad linguistic generalization. These results highlight both
the potential and the constraints of adapting human-inspired learning
strategies to low-resource LMs, and point toward hybrid, curriculum-based
approaches for enhancing generalization under ecological training limits.

Motivation: 传统专家方法难以跟上快速发展的ICT领域创新周期和早期模糊术语，需要新的技术预测方法。

Method: 利用LLM从非结构化文本中提取语义三元组，构建技术实体关系图，开发名词钉合方法分组相似技术术语，使用图指标检测融合信号，包括多阶段过滤、领域特定关键词聚类和主题共现时序分析。

Result: 在arXiv预印本(278,625篇)和USPTO专利申请(9,793项)数据集上验证，能够识别已建立和新兴的融合模式。

Conclusion: 该管道提供了一个可扩展、通用的技术预测框架，基于全文分析，能够有效监测变革性技术的出现。

Abstract: Forecasting transformative technologies remains a critical but challenging
task, particularly in fast-evolving domains such as Information and
Communication Technologies (ICTs). Traditional expert-based methods struggle to
keep pace with short innovation cycles and ambiguous early-stage terminology.
In this work, we propose a novel, data-driven pipeline to monitor the emergence
of transformative technologies by identifying patterns of technological
convergence.
  Our approach leverages advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract
semantic triples from unstructured text and construct a large-scale graph of
technology-related entities and relations. We introduce a new method for
grouping semantically similar technology terms (noun stapling) and develop
graph-based metrics to detect convergence signals. The pipeline includes
multi-stage filtering, domain-specific keyword clustering, and a temporal trend
analysis of topic co-occurence.
  We validate our methodology on two complementary datasets: 278,625 arXiv
preprints (2017--2024) to capture early scientific signals, and 9,793 USPTO
patent applications (2018-2024) to track downstream commercial developments.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline can identify both
established and emerging convergence patterns, offering a scalable and
generalizable framework for technology forecasting grounded in full-text
analysis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了大型语言模型在生成参考文献时产生幻觉的问题，发现引用次数与幻觉率呈强负相关，当论文引用超过约1000次时，模型几乎能逐字记忆参考文献信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在文献推荐中存在幻觉问题，即生成不存在的论文引用。本研究假设模型的幻觉率与训练数据中文献的出现频率相关，引用次数可作为训练数据冗余度的代理指标。

Method: 使用GPT-4生成100个计算机科学领域的文献记录，通过人工验证和余弦相似度测量生成文献与真实元数据的事实一致性，分析引用频率对幻觉率的影响。

Result: 结果显示：(1)不同研究领域的幻觉率存在差异；(2)引用次数与事实准确性呈强相关；(3)当引用次数超过约1000次时，文献信息几乎被逐字记忆。

Conclusion: 高引用论文几乎被模型逐字保留，表明存在一个从泛化转向记忆的阈值，引用次数可作为预测模型幻觉率的重要指标。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range
of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they
have also been used to assist in bibliographic recommendation, the
hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior
studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce
bibliographic information depends on whether the underlying knowledge is
generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear
in the training corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume
citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency
with which a given bibliographic record is repeatedly represented in the
pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated
references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified
100 bibliographic records across twenty computer-science domains, and measured
factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic
metadata. The results revealed that (i) hallucination rates vary across
research domains, (ii) citation count is strongly correlated with factual
accuracy, and (iii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatimly
memorized beyond approximately 1,000 citations. These findings suggest that
highly cited papers are nearly verbatimly retained in the model, indicating a
threshold where generalization shifts into memorization.

Motivation: 心理健康AI发展受限于缺乏真实的治疗对话数据，主要由于严格的隐私法规和历史上很少记录临床会话。

Method: 基于认知行为疗法原则，开发SQPsych框架，将结构化心理输入通过治疗师-客户模拟转换为自然语言对话，使用开源LLM生成高质量语料库。

Result: 在SQPsychConv上微调的SQPsychLLM模型在心理咨询基准测试中表现优异，在关键治疗技能上超越基线模型。

Conclusion: 合成数据具有实现可扩展、数据安全且临床知情的心理健康AI支持的潜力。

Abstract: The development of AI for mental health is hindered by a lack of authentic
therapy dialogues, due to strict privacy regulations and the fact that clinical
sessions were historically rarely recorded. We present an LLM-driven pipeline
that generates synthetic counseling dialogues based on structured client
profiles and psychological questionnaires. Grounded on the principles of
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), our method creates synthetic therapeutic
conversations for clinical disorders such as anxiety and depression. Our
framework, SQPsych (Structured Questionnaire-based Psychotherapy), converts
structured psychological input into natural language dialogues through
therapist-client simulations. Due to data governance policies and privacy
restrictions prohibiting the transmission of clinical questionnaire data to
third-party services, previous methodologies relying on proprietary models are
infeasible in our setting. We address this limitation by generating a
high-quality corpus using open-weight LLMs, validated through human expert
evaluation and LLM-based assessments. Our SQPsychLLM models fine-tuned on
SQPsychConv achieve strong performance on counseling benchmarks, surpassing
baselines in key therapeutic skills. Our findings highlight the potential of
synthetic data to enable scalable, data-secure, and clinically informed AI for
mental health support. We will release our code, models, and corpus at

TL;DR: BhashaBench V1是首个针对印度知识系统的领域特定、多任务、双语基准测试，包含74,166个精心策划的问答对，涵盖农业、法律、金融和阿育吠陀四大领域，用于评估LLMs在印度语境下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准大多以英语为中心且领域通用，无法有效评估LLMs在印度特定文化和领域背景下的表现，因此需要开发专门针对印度知识系统的评估工具。

Method: 构建包含74,166个问答对的双语基准数据集，其中52,494个英文和21,672个印地语，数据来源于真实的政府和领域特定考试，涵盖4大领域、90+子领域和500+主题。

Result: 评估29+个LLMs发现显著的领域和语言性能差距，GPT-4o在法律领域准确率达76.49%，但在阿育吠陀仅59.74%；所有模型在英文内容上的表现均优于印地语；网络法、国际金融等子领域表现较好，而Panchakarma、种子科学和人权等领域表现较弱。

Conclusion: BhashaBench V1为评估LLMs在印度多样化知识领域的表现提供了全面数据集，能够评估模型整合领域特定知识与双语理解的能力，所有资源已公开以支持开放研究。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models(LLMs) has intensified the need
for domain and culture specific evaluation. Existing benchmarks are largely
Anglocentric and domain-agnostic, limiting their applicability to India-centric
contexts. To address this gap, we introduce BhashaBench V1, the first
domain-specific, multi-task, bilingual benchmark focusing on critical Indic
knowledge systems. BhashaBench V1 contains 74,166 meticulously curated
question-answer pairs, with 52,494 in English and 21,672 in Hindi, sourced from
authentic government and domain-specific exams. It spans four major domains:
Agriculture, Legal, Finance, and Ayurveda, comprising 90+ subdomains and
covering 500+ topics, enabling fine-grained evaluation. Evaluation of 29+ LLMs
reveals significant domain and language specific performance gaps, with
especially large disparities in low-resource domains. For instance, GPT-4o
achieves 76.49% overall accuracy in Legal but only 59.74% in Ayurveda. Models
consistently perform better on English content compared to Hindi across all
domains. Subdomain-level analysis shows that areas such as Cyber Law,
International Finance perform relatively well, while Panchakarma, Seed Science,
and Human Rights remain notably weak. BhashaBench V1 provides a comprehensive
dataset for evaluating large language models across India's diverse knowledge
domains. It enables assessment of models' ability to integrate domain-specific
knowledge with bilingual understanding. All code, benchmarks, and resources are
publicly available to support open research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM服务系统主要为文本补全设计，无法适应日益复杂的LLM应用需求，缺乏灵活性和效率。

Method: 设计LLM推理程序(LIPs)架构，允许运行时自定义token预测和KV缓存管理，将部分应用逻辑卸载到服务器；实现Symphony系统作为LIPs的操作系统，通过系统调用暴露LLM计算，虚拟化KV缓存，采用两级进程调度确保GPU效率。

Result: Symphony系统能够更高效地服务复杂LLM应用，提供更好的可扩展性和灵活性。

Conclusion: 该架构为LLM应用开辟了更高效和可扩展的生态系统，解决了现有系统的局限性。

Abstract: Current large language model (LLM) serving systems, primarily designed for
text completion, are neither efficient nor adaptable for increasingly complex
LLM applications due to their inflexible design. We propose a new LLM serving
system architecture that serves programs instead of prompts to address this
problem. These programs, called LLM Inference Programs (LIPs), allow users to
customize token prediction and KV cache management at runtime and to offload
parts of their application logic, such as tool execution, to the server. We
describe an example of this architecture through a system named Symphony, which
functions as an operating system for LIPs. Symphony exposes LLM model
computations via system calls and virtualizes KV cache with a dedicated file
system, while ensuring GPU efficiency with a two-level process scheduling
scheme. Symphony has the potential to open the door to a more efficient and
extensible ecosystem for LLM applications.

TL;DR: 提出首个利用视觉语言模型自动标注和过滤手语数据的框架，显著减少人工标注依赖，应用于TikTok视频构建多语言手语数据集TikTok-SL-8。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手语翻译数据集规模有限、多语言覆盖不足，且依赖专家标注和受控录制环境，成本高昂。视觉语言模型在手语数据获取方面的潜力尚未被开发。

Method: 基于VLM的管道包括人脸可见性检测、手语活动识别、视频文本提取以及视频文本对齐验证，实现通用过滤、标注和验证步骤，应用于TikTok视频和YouTube-SL-25数据集。

Result: 构建了TikTok-SL-8多语言手语数据集，在德语和美国手语上评估了两个现成SLT模型，为自动提取的稍带噪声数据建立了基线性能。

Conclusion: 该工作实现了手语翻译的可扩展弱监督预训练，促进了从社交媒体获取手语数据的能力。

Abstract: Most existing sign language translation (SLT) datasets are limited in scale,
lack multilingual coverage, and are costly to curate due to their reliance on
expert annotation and controlled recording setup. Recently, Vision Language
Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities as evaluators and real-time
assistants. Despite these advancements, their potential remains untapped in the
context of sign language dataset acquisition. To bridge this gap, we introduce
the first automated annotation and filtering framework that utilizes VLMs to
reduce reliance on manual effort while preserving data quality. Our method is
applied to TikTok videos across eight sign languages and to the already curated
YouTube-SL-25 dataset in German Sign Language for the purpose of additional
evaluation. Our VLM-based pipeline includes a face visibility detection, a sign
activity recognition, a text extraction from video content, and a judgment step
to validate alignment between video and text, implementing generic filtering,

*Asutosh Hota,Jussi P. P. Jokinen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了大语言模型理解隐含意图的能力，发现更大模型更接近人类理解，而理解隐含意义能显著提升回答质量，67.6%参与者更喜欢基于隐含意图的回应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在人类-计算机交互中日益重要，需要关注交互的语言学基础，特别是隐含意义，这对于人机对齐至关重要。

Method: 研究考察了LLMs从上下文驱动提示中推断用户意图的能力，以及理解隐含意义是否能改善回答生成。

Result: 更大模型更接近人类解释，小模型在隐含意义推理上表现较差；基于隐含意义的提示显著提升了回答的相关性和质量，小模型提升尤其明显。

Conclusion: 语言学理论可用于解决对齐问题，使人机交互更加自然和基于上下文，67.6%参与者更喜欢隐含意义嵌入的提示。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) is positioning language
at the core of human-computer interaction (HCI). We argue that advancing HCI
requires attention to the linguistic foundations of interaction, particularly
implicature (meaning conveyed beyond explicit statements through shared
context) which is essential for human-AI (HAI) alignment. This study examines
LLMs' ability to infer user intent embedded in context-driven prompts and
whether understanding implicature improves response generation. Results show
that larger models approximate human interpretations more closely, while
smaller models struggle with implicature inference. Furthermore,
implicature-based prompts significantly enhance the perceived relevance and
quality of responses across models, with notable gains in smaller models.
Overall, 67.6% of participants preferred responses with implicature-embedded
prompts to literal ones, highlighting a clear preference for contextually
nuanced communication. Our work contributes to understanding how linguistic
theory can be used to address the alignment problem by making HAI interaction
more natural and contextually grounded.

TL;DR: RLMEval是一个针对研究级数学定理证明和证明自动形式化的评估套件，基于真实的Lean形式化项目，揭示了当前最先进模型在实际研究场景中的表现差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在精选基准测试中表现优异，但在研究级神经定理证明和证明自动形式化方面的实际影响仍然有限。需要更贴近真实研究场景的评估标准。

Method: 利用真实的Lean Blueprint形式化项目构建RLMEval评估套件，包含来自6个Lean项目的613个定理，专注于研究级数学定理的挑战性评估。

Result: 在RLMEval上的评估显示，现有基准测试的进展并不能直接转化到这些更现实的环境中，最佳模型的通过率仅为10.3%。

Conclusion: RLMEval提供了一个新的、具有挑战性的基准，旨在指导和加速形式数学中自动推理的进展。

Abstract: Despite impressive results on curated benchmarks, the practical impact of
large language models (LLMs) on research-level neural theorem proving and proof
autoformalization is still limited. We introduce RLMEval, an evaluation suite
for these tasks, focusing on research-level mathematics from real-world Lean
formalization projects. RLMEval targets the evaluation of neural theorem
proving and proof autoformalization on challenging research-level theorems by
leveraging real Lean Blueprint formalization projects. Our evaluation of
state-of-the-art models on RLMEval, comprising 613 theorems from 6 Lean
projects, reveals a significant gap: progress on existing benchmarks does not
readily translate to these more realistic settings, with the best model
achieving only a 10.3 % pass rate. RLMEval provides a new, challenging
benchmark designed to guide and accelerate progress in automated reasoning for
formal mathematics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在定性社会科学研究中面临的解释偏见、低可靠性和弱可审计性等挑战。

Method: 基于Web of Science上所有使用LLM作为工具的社会科学论文，分析LLM应用在解释深度和自主性两个维度上的现状。

Result: 提出了一个分类框架，建议研究人员像委派工作给有能力的本科生研究助理一样，将任务分解为可管理部分。

Conclusion: 通过保持低自主性并在监督下选择性增加解释深度，可以在保持透明度和可靠性的同时获得LLM的好处。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized by researchers across
a wide range of domains, and qualitative social science is no exception;
however, this adoption faces persistent challenges, including interpretive
bias, low reliability, and weak auditability. We introduce a framework that
situates LLM usage along two dimensions, interpretive depth and autonomy,
thereby offering a straightforward way to classify LLM applications in
qualitative research and to derive practical design recommendations. We present
the state of the literature with respect to these two dimensions, based on all
published social science papers available on Web of Science that use LLMs as a
tool and not strictly as the subject of study. Rather than granting models
expansive freedom, our approach encourages researchers to decompose tasks into
manageable segments, much as they would when delegating work to capable
undergraduate research assistants. By maintaining low levels of autonomy and
selectively increasing interpretive depth only where warranted and under
supervision, one can plausibly reap the benefits of LLMs while preserving
transparency and reliability.

TL;DR: 本文分析了手语翻译(SLT)中基于文本的自动评估指标的局限性，包括BLEU、ROUGE等传统指标和LLM评估器，发现它们在语义等价性、幻觉检测等方面存在不足，需要多模态评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前手语翻译评估主要依赖文本指标，但这些指标在多大程度上能可靠评估SLT输出质量尚不明确，需要系统分析其局限性。

Method: 通过分析6种评估指标（BLEU、chrF、ROUGE、BLEURT以及LLM评估器G-Eval和GEMBA），在三种控制条件下评估其一致性和鲁棒性：释义、模型输出幻觉和句子长度变化。

Result: 词汇重叠指标存在局限，LLM评估器能更好捕捉语义等价性但偏向LLM释义翻译；所有指标都能检测幻觉，但BLEU过于敏感，BLEURT和LLM评估器对细微案例较宽松。

Conclusion: 需要超越文本指标的多模态评估框架，以实现对手语翻译输出的更全面评估。

Abstract: Automatic evaluation metrics are crucial for advancing sign language
translation (SLT). Current SLT evaluation metrics, such as BLEU and ROUGE, are
only text-based, and it remains unclear to what extent text-based metrics can
reliably capture the quality of SLT outputs. To address this gap, we
investigate the limitations of text-based SLT evaluation metrics by analyzing
six metrics, including BLEU, chrF, and ROUGE, as well as BLEURT on the one
hand, and large language model (LLM)-based evaluators such as G-Eval and GEMBA
zero-shot direct assessment on the other hand. Specifically, we assess the
consistency and robustness of these metrics under three controlled conditions:
paraphrasing, hallucinations in model outputs, and variations in sentence
length. Our analysis highlights the limitations of lexical overlap metrics and
demonstrates that while LLM-based evaluators better capture semantic
equivalence often missed by conventional metrics, they can also exhibit bias
toward LLM-paraphrased translations. Moreover, although all metrics are able to
detect hallucinations, BLEU tends to be overly sensitive, whereas BLEURT and
LLM-based evaluators are comparatively lenient toward subtle cases. This
motivates the need for multimodal evaluation frameworks that extend beyond
text-based metrics to enable a more holistic assessment of SLT outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs主要作为被动响应者，但在高风险领域需要它们成为主动、目标导向的合作伙伴。现有方法要么短视优化单轮属性，要么依赖脆弱、高成本的用户模拟器，存在"现实差距"。

Method: 利用专家轨迹的观察未来推断密集的逐轮奖励信号，将长视野问题分解为监督学习任务，训练策略输出结构化的（行动，状态评估）元组，控制"问什么"和"何时停止"。通过自动评分器校准管道净化LLM奖励模型的噪声。

Result: 在真实医疗数据集上验证了Learn-to-Ask的有效性，使用高达32B参数的LLMs。在严格的内部评估中，部署的模型性能甚至优于人类专家。

Conclusion: 该框架为将被动LLMs转变为主动、目标导向的LLM应用提供了实用且经济可行的蓝图，能够将离线数据转化为实际、真实世界的影响。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel as passive responders, but teaching them
to be proactive, goal-oriented partners, a critical capability in high-stakes
domains, remains a major challenge. Current paradigms either myopically
optimize single-turn attributes or rely on brittle, high-cost user simulators,
creating a persistent ``reality gap''. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\texttt{Learn-to-Ask}, a general, simulator-free framework for learning and
deploying proactive dialogue agents \textit{directly from offline expert data},
bypassing the need to model complex user dynamics. Our key insight is to
reframe the offline policy learning problem by leveraging the \textbf{observed
future} of each expert trajectory. This allows us to infer a dense,
turn-by-turn reward signal grounded in the expert's revealed strategy,
decomposing the intractable long-horizon problem into a series of supervised
learning tasks, and training a policy to output a structured \texttt{(action,
state_assessment)} tuple, governing both \textbf{what to ask} and, crucially,
\textbf{when to stop}. To ensure reward fidelity, our Automated Grader
Calibration pipeline systematically purges noise from the LLM-based reward
model with minimal human supervision. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy
of \texttt{Learn-to-Ask} in a real-world medical dataset, using LLMs of varying
sizes up to 32B. Our approach culminates in the successful deployment of LLMs
into a live, large-scale online AI service. In rigorous in-house evaluations,
our model was launched and achieved performance even superior to human experts,
proving our framework's ability to translate offline data into tangible,
real-world impact. We hope this work provides a practical and economically
viable blueprint for transforming passive LLMs into proactive, goal-oriented
LLM applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决快速演变的亚文化和俚语对自动化信息提取和执法监控带来的挑战，需要开发能够适应新兴语言趋势的系统。

Method: 使用LLaMA Factory框架对LLaMA3-8B-Instruct等模型在通用和特定领域数据集上进行指令微调，结合命名实体识别技术。

Result: 领域特定微调显著提升了摘要和标注准确性，LLaMA3-8B-Instruct模型在中文理解方面超越中文训练模型，表明推理能力可以跨语言迁移。

Conclusion: 该管道能够将非结构化文本转化为可操作的见解，为现代知识管理和安全操作提供可扩展的实时解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a pipeline integrating fine-tuned large language models
(LLMs) with named entity recognition (NER) for efficient domain-specific text
summarization and tagging. The authors address the challenge posed by rapidly
evolving sub-cultural languages and slang, which complicate automated
information extraction and law enforcement monitoring. By leveraging the LLaMA
Factory framework, the study fine-tunes LLMs on both generalpurpose and custom
domain-specific datasets, particularly in the political and security domains.
The models are evaluated using BLEU and ROUGE metrics, demonstrating that
instruction fine-tuning significantly enhances summarization and tagging
accuracy, especially for specialized corpora. Notably, the LLaMA3-8B-Instruct
model, despite its initial limitations in Chinese comprehension, outperforms
its Chinese-trained counterpart after domainspecific fine-tuning, suggesting
that underlying reasoning capabilities can transfer across languages. The
pipeline enables concise summaries and structured entity tagging, facilitating
rapid document categorization and distribution. This approach proves scalable
and adaptable for real-time applications, supporting efficient information
management and the ongoing need to capture emerging language trends. The
integration of LLMs and NER offers a robust solution for transforming
unstructured text into actionable insights, crucial for modern knowledge
management and security operations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的角色模拟评估存在局限：大多依赖合成对话、缺乏系统框架、缺少能力需求分析。

Method: 引入TwinVoice基准，涵盖三个角色维度（社交、人际、叙事）和六项基础能力（观点一致性、记忆回忆、逻辑推理、词汇保真度、角色语气、句法风格）。

Result: 实验结果显示，先进模型在角色模拟方面达到中等准确率，但在句法风格和记忆回忆等能力上仍有不足，平均性能远低于人类基线。

Conclusion: LLM在角色模拟方面仍有显著提升空间，特别是在句法风格和记忆回忆等关键能力上需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are exhibiting emergent human-like abilities and
are increasingly envisioned as the foundation for simulating an individual's
communication style, behavioral tendencies, and personality traits. However,
current evaluations of LLM-based persona simulation remain limited: most rely
on synthetic dialogues, lack systematic frameworks, and lack analysis of the
capability requirement. To address these limitations, we introduce TwinVoice, a
comprehensive benchmark for assessing persona simulation across diverse
real-world contexts. TwinVoice encompasses three dimensions: Social Persona
(public social interactions), Interpersonal Persona (private dialogues), and
Narrative Persona (role-based expression). It further decomposes the evaluation
of LLM performance into six fundamental capabilities, including opinion
consistency, memory recall, logical reasoning, lexical fidelity, persona tone,
and syntactic style. Experimental results reveal that while advanced models
achieve moderate accuracy in persona simulation, they still fall short of
capabilities such as syntactic style and memory recall. Consequently, the
average performance achieved by LLMs remains considerably below the human
baseline.

Motivation: 虽然LLM智能体在行动规划方面已有研究，但它们在协作实现共同目标方面的能力尚未充分探索，特别是在信息不对称条件下。

Method: 采用微调加验证器框架，为LLM智能体配备不同的沟通策略和环境验证信号，在扩展的爱因斯坦谜题桌面游戏中测试协作能力。

Result: 实验结果表明对齐沟通至关重要，无沟通的智能体也能达到高任务性能，但缺乏真正的规则理解和人类评估者的信任。通过环境验证器增强了智能体的任务规则理解能力。

Conclusion: 集成基于环境的验证器可以增强智能体理解任务规则和完成任务的能力，促进AI系统中更安全和可解释的协作。

Abstract: While Large Language Model (LLM) agents are often approached from the angle
of action planning/generation to accomplish a goal (e.g., given by language
descriptions), their abilities to collaborate with each other to achieve a
joint goal are not well explored. To address this limitation, this paper
studies LLM agents in task collaboration, particularly under the condition of
information asymmetry, where agents have disparities in their knowledge and
skills and need to work together to complete a shared task. We extend Einstein
Puzzles, a classical symbolic puzzle, to a table-top game. In this game, two
LLM agents must reason, communicate, and act to satisfy spatial and relational
constraints required to solve the puzzle. We apply a fine-tuning-plus-verifier
framework in which LLM agents are equipped with various communication
strategies and verification signals from the environment. Empirical results
highlight the critical importance of aligned communication, especially when
agents possess both information-seeking and -providing capabilities.
Interestingly, agents without communication can still achieve high task
performance; however, further analysis reveals a lack of true rule
understanding and lower trust from human evaluators. Instead, by integrating an
environment-based verifier, we enhance agents' ability to comprehend task rules
and complete tasks, promoting both safer and more interpretable collaboration
in AI systems. https://github.com/Roihn/EinsteinPuzzles

Motivation: 测试时缩放技术在数学和编程等正式领域已被证明有效，但在论证性领域（如法律）的价值尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用7个奖励模型家族，在现实的低N预算下评估了结果级验证（Best-of-N）和过程级验证（树搜索）方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为测试时缩放技术在法律领域的应用提供了实证基础，揭示了验证器效用的关键决定因素。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) techniques can improve the performance of large
language models (LLMs) at the expense of additional computation and latency.
While TTS has proven effective in formal domains such as mathematics and
programming \citep{snell2024scaling, chen2024more}, its value in argumentative
domains such as law remains underexplored. We present an empirical study of
verifier-based TTS methods for legal multiple-choice QA (MCQA) across five
benchmarks. Using a family of 7 reward models, we evaluate both outcome-level
(Best-of-$N$) and process-level (tree search) verification under realistic
low-$N$ budgets. Our analysis systematically investigates how verifier utility
is affected by key properties such as domain specialization, model size, and
supervision type (process-supervised PRMs vs. outcome-only ORMs), even when
applied across different roles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估只关注推理正确性而忽略效率，但真实推理场景中需要识别和忽略无关信息，这是人类推理的重要特征。

Method: 基于逻辑编程构建框架，将语言模型生成的自然语言证明与逻辑程序找到的最短证明对齐，量化推理效率；构建包含不同语义重叠度无关公理的数学应用题数据集。

Result: 当前语言模型在有干扰时准确率显著下降，即使是最小且领域一致的干扰；生成的证明经常包含无关推理的绕路。

Conclusion: 语言模型在推理效率方面存在不足，需要改进以更好地处理真实世界中的无关信息干扰。

Abstract: Modern language models (LMs) exhibit strong deductive reasoning capabilities,
yet standard evaluations emphasize correctness while overlooking a key aspect
of human-like reasoning: efficiency. In real-world reasoning scenarios, much of
the available information is irrelevant, and effective deductive inference
requires identifying and ignoring such distractions. We propose a framework for
assessing LM reasoning efficiency through the lens of logic programming,
introducing a simple method to align proofs written in natural language -- as
generated by an LM -- with shortest proofs found by executing the logic
program. Efficiency is quantified by measuring how well a model avoids
unnecessary inference. Empirically, we construct a dataset of math word
problems injected with various number of irrelevant axioms that vary in
semantic overlap with the goal theorem. We find that current LMs show marked
accuracy declines under such conditions -- even with minimal, domain-consistent
distractions -- and the proofs they generate frequently exhibit detours through
irrelevant inferences.

Motivation: 电子健康记录包含丰富但复杂的信息，现有大型语言模型在EHR分析方面能力有限，存在任务覆盖范围窄和缺乏EHR导向推理能力的问题。

Method: 开发了思维图驱动框架生成大规模高质量推理数据，构建了EHR-R1系列模型（最大72B参数），采用领域适应、推理增强和强化学习的多阶段训练范式。

Result: EHR-R1在MIMIC-Bench上比GPT-4o高出30多分，在EHRSHOT上零样本AUROC提高10%，持续优于最先进的商业和开源LLM。

Conclusion: EHR-Ins、EHR-R1和EHR-Bench共同显著推进了更可靠和临床相关的EHR分析发展。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich yet complex information, and
their automated analysis is critical for clinical decision-making. Despite
recent advances of large language models (LLMs) in clinical workflows, their
ability to analyze EHRs remains limited due to narrow task coverage and lack of
EHR-oriented reasoning capabilities. This paper aims to bridge the gap,
specifically, we present EHR-Ins, a large-scale, comprehensive EHR reasoning
instruction dataset, comprising 300k high-quality reasoning cases and 4M
non-reasoning cases across 42 distinct EHR tasks. Its core innovation is a
thinking-graph-driven framework that enables to generate high-quality reasoning
data at scale. Based on it, we develop EHR-R1, a series of reasoning-enhanced
LLMs with up to 72B parameters tailored for EHR analysis. Through a multi-stage
training paradigm, including domain adaptation, reasoning enhancement, and
reinforcement learning, EHR-R1 systematically acquires domain knowledge and
diverse reasoning capabilities, enabling accurate and robust EHR analysis.
Lastly, we introduce EHR-Bench, a new benchmark curated from MIMIC-IV, spanning
42 tasks, to comprehensively assess reasoning and prediction across EHR
scenarios. In experiments, we show that the resulting EHR-R1 consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art commercial and open-source LLMs (including
DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o), surpassing GPT-4o by over 30 points on MIMIC-Bench and
achieving a 10\% higher zero-shot AUROC on EHRSHOT. Collectively, EHR-Ins,
EHR-R1, and EHR-Bench have significantly advanced the development for more
reliable and clinically relevant EHR analysis.

Motivation: 统一视觉语言模型需要在单一架构中同时处理理解和生成任务，但这些任务依赖异构数据和监督，在强化学习中难以平衡。

Method: 使用GPT-o3增强单任务数据，为理解样本生成描述，为生成样本生成问答对，形成对齐对；检索语义相关的理解样本形成检索对；提出Pair-GPRO优化方法，基于相似度评分调节优势函数。

Result: 构建了16K高质量PairUG数据集，在Janus-Pro等UVLM模型上实现了平衡的改进，优于现有UVLM强化学习基线。

Conclusion: PairUni框架通过数据重组和优化对齐，有效解决了统一视觉语言模型中理解和生成任务的平衡问题。

Abstract: Unified vision-language models (UVLMs) must perform both understanding and
generation within a single architecture, but these tasks rely on heterogeneous
data and supervision, making it difficult to balance them during reinforcement
learning (RL). We propose PairUni, a unified framework that reorganizes data
into understanding-generation (UG) pairs and aligns optimization accordingly.
We first use GPT-o3 to augment single-task data, generating captions for
understanding samples and question-answer (QA) pairs for generation samples,
forming aligned pairs from the same instance. Additionally, for each generation
sample, we retrieve a semantically related understanding example to form a
retrieved pair, linking different but related data points. These paired
structures expose cross-task semantic correspondences and support consistent
policy learning. To leverage this structure, we present Pair-GPRO, a pair-aware
variant based on Group Relative Policy Optimization. It assigns a similarity
score to each pair to modulate the advantage, strengthening learning from
well-aligned examples and reducing task interference. We curate a high-quality
dataset of 16K UG pairs named PairUG for RL fine-tuning and evaluate PairUni on
the powerful Janus-Pro UVLMs. Our approach achieves balanced improvements on
various UVLMs, outperforming strong UVLM RL baselines. Code:

Result: LLM能够识别关键金融风险指标，但其特征重要性排序与LightGBM显著不同，自解释与经验SHAP归因经常不一致。

Conclusion: LLM作为结构化金融风险预测的独立模型存在局限性，其自生成解释的可信度值得关注，需要在风险敏感金融环境中进行可解释性审计、与可解释模型基线比较以及人工监督。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored as flexible
alternatives to classical machine learning models for classification tasks
through zero-shot prompting. However, their suitability for structured tabular
data remains underexplored, especially in high-stakes financial applications
such as financial risk assessment. This study conducts a systematic comparison
between zero-shot LLM-based classifiers and LightGBM, a state-of-the-art
gradient-boosting model, on a real-world loan default prediction task. We
evaluate their predictive performance, analyze feature attributions using SHAP,
and assess the reliability of LLM-generated self-explanations. While LLMs are
able to identify key financial risk indicators, their feature importance
rankings diverge notably from LightGBM, and their self-explanations often fail
to align with empirical SHAP attributions. These findings highlight the
limitations of LLMs as standalone models for structured financial risk
prediction and raise concerns about the trustworthiness of their self-generated
explanations. Our results underscore the need for explainability audits,
baseline comparisons with interpretable models, and human-in-the-loop oversight
when deploying LLMs in risk-sensitive financial environments.

Method: 基于高质量Model Context Protocol (MCP)服务器构建，提供来自真实软件的初始环境状态，包含108个需要与多个应用交互约20轮才能完成的手工任务，每个任务都通过专用评估脚本严格验证。

Result: 评估显示当前最先进模型表现显著不足：最佳模型Claude-4.5-Sonnet仅达到38.6%的成功率，平均需要20.2次工具调用；最佳开源模型DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp仅达到20.1%的成功率。

Conclusion: Toolathlon基准测试将推动开发更强大的语言智能体，以应对真实世界中长期复杂任务的执行挑战。

Abstract: Real-world language agents must handle complex, multi-step workflows across
diverse Apps. For instance, an agent may manage emails by coordinating with
calendars and file systems, or monitor a production database to detect
anomalies and generate reports following an operating manual. However, existing
language agent benchmarks often focus on narrow domains or simplified tasks
that lack the diversity, realism, and long-horizon complexity required to
evaluate agents' real-world performance. To address this gap, we introduce the
Tool Decathlon (dubbed as Toolathlon), a benchmark for language agents offering
diverse Apps and tools, realistic environment setup, and reliable
execution-based evaluation. Toolathlon spans 32 software applications and 604
tools, ranging from everyday platforms such as Google Calendar and Notion to
professional ones like WooCommerce, Kubernetes, and BigQuery. Most of the tools
are based on a high-quality set of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that we
may have revised or implemented ourselves. Unlike prior works, which primarily
ensure functional realism but offer limited environment state diversity, we
provide realistic initial environment states from real software, such as Canvas
courses with dozens of students or real financial spreadsheets. This benchmark
includes 108 manually sourced or crafted tasks in total, requiring interacting
with multiple Apps over around 20 turns on average to complete. Each task is
strictly verifiable through dedicated evaluation scripts. Comprehensive
evaluation of SOTA models highlights their significant shortcomings: the
best-performing model, Claude-4.5-Sonnet, achieves only a 38.6% success rate
with 20.2 tool calling turns on average, while the top open-weights model
DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp reaches 20.1%. We expect Toolathlon to drive the development
of more capable language agents for real-world, long-horizon task execution.

### [137] [The Limits of Obliviate: Evaluating Unlearning in LLMs via Stimulus-Knowledge Entanglement-Behavior Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25732)
*Aakriti Shah,Thai Le*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了通过说服性提示从未学习的大语言模型中恢复事实知识，发现说服性提示能显著提高事实知识回忆率，且效果与模型大小呈负相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型遗忘效果的有效性是一个开放性问题，需要研究如何从未学习模型中恢复敏感数据和纠正错误信息。

Method: 基于ACT-R和Hebbian理论，提出刺激-知识纠缠-行为框架(SKeB)，通过领域图建模信息纠缠，并开发纠缠指标来量化知识激活模式。

Result: 说服性提示显著增强了事实知识回忆(从14.8%提升到24.5%)，且效果与模型大小负相关(2.7B模型恢复128%，13B模型仅恢复15%)。

Conclusion: SKeB框架为评估大语言模型遗忘完整性、鲁棒性和整体行为提供了基础。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for managing sensitive
data and correcting misinformation, yet evaluating its effectiveness remains an
open problem. We investigate whether persuasive prompting can recall factual
knowledge from deliberately unlearned LLMs across models ranging from 2.7B to
13B parameters (OPT-2.7B, LLaMA-2-7B, LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-2-13B). Drawing from
ACT-R and Hebbian theory (spreading activation theories), as well as
communication principles, we introduce Stimulus-Knowledge Entanglement-Behavior
Framework (SKeB), which models information entanglement via domain graphs and
tests whether factual recall in unlearned models is correlated with persuasive
framing. We develop entanglement metrics to quantify knowledge activation
patterns and evaluate factuality, non-factuality, and hallucination in outputs.
Our results show persuasive prompts substantially enhance factual knowledge
recall (14.8% baseline vs. 24.5% with authority framing), with effectiveness
inversely correlated to model size (128% recovery in 2.7B vs. 15% in 13B). SKeB
provides a foundation for assessing unlearning completeness, robustness, and
overall behavior in LLMs.

TL;DR: Ouro是一个预训练的循环语言模型家族，通过在潜在空间进行迭代计算、熵正则化目标学习深度分配，以及扩展到7.7T tokens的训练，将推理能力构建到预训练阶段，1.4B和2.6B模型在多个基准测试中达到12B SOTA LLM的性能水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代LLM主要通过显式文本生成（如思维链）进行"思考"，这推迟了推理到训练后阶段，未能充分利用预训练数据。作者希望将推理能力直接构建到预训练阶段。

Method: 提出循环语言模型(LoopLM)，包含：(i) 潜在空间中的迭代计算；(ii) 熵正则化目标用于学习深度分配；(iii) 扩展到7.7T tokens的大规模预训练。

Result: Ouro 1.4B和2.6B模型在广泛基准测试中表现优异，匹配了高达12B SOTA LLM的结果。控制实验表明这种优势来自更优越的知识操作能力，而非增加的知识容量。

Conclusion: LoopLM显示出作为推理时代新型扩展方向的潜力，其推理轨迹比显式思维链更与最终输出对齐。

Abstract: Modern LLMs are trained to "think" primarily via explicit text generation,
such as chain-of-thought (CoT), which defers reasoning to post-training and
under-leverages pre-training data. We present and open-source Ouro, named after
the recursive Ouroboros, a family of pre-trained Looped Language Models
(LoopLM) that instead build reasoning into the pre-training phase through (i)
iterative computation in latent space, (ii) an entropy-regularized objective
for learned depth allocation, and (iii) scaling to 7.7T tokens. Ouro 1.4B and
2.6B models enjoy superior performance that match the results of up to 12B SOTA
LLMs across a wide range of benchmarks. Through controlled experiments, we show
this advantage stems not from increased knowledge capacity, but from superior
knowledge manipulation capabilities. We also show that LoopLM yields reasoning
traces more aligned with final outputs than explicit CoT. We hope our results
show the potential of LoopLM as a novel scaling direction in the reasoning era.

Motivation: 当前代理评估集中于一次性任务完成，未能反映现实世界中问题的迭代性和协作性本质，人类目标往往不明确且会演变

Method: 引入协作努力扩展框架，通过案例研究和模拟评估分析代理在多轮真实场景中的表现

Result: 最先进的代理在多轮真实场景中表现不佳，缺乏维持参与度和构建用户理解的能力

Conclusion: 协作努力扩展为诊断代理行为和指导开发更有效交互提供了新的视角

Abstract: Current evaluations of agents remain centered around one-shot task
completion, failing to account for the inherently iterative and collaborative
nature of many real-world problems, where human goals are often underspecified
and evolve. We argue for a shift from building and assessing task completion
agents to developing collaborative agents, assessed not only by the quality of
their final outputs but by how well they engage with and enhance human effort
throughout the problem-solving process. To support this shift, we introduce
collaborative effort scaling, a framework that captures how an agent's utility
grows with increasing user involvement. Through case studies and simulated
evaluations, we show that state-of-the-art agents often underperform in
multi-turn, real-world scenarios, revealing a missing ingredient in agent
design: the ability to sustain engagement and scaffold user understanding.
Collaborative effort scaling offers a lens for diagnosing agent behavior and
guiding development toward more effective interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究论文中的图表对于传达思想至关重要，但制作复杂且耗时。虽然图表以图像形式呈现，但标准图像生成模型难以生成结构清晰的图表。LLM可以直接生成SVG格式的文本图表，但缺乏有效的评估指标。

Method: 将图表概念化为图结构，文本元素作为节点，连接作为有向边。使用两组新指标评估图表质量：节点对齐和路径对齐。

Result: 首次有效评估了最先进LLM在近期研究文献上生成的图表，定量证明了所提指标的有效性。增强的可解释性为理解LLM生成图表的特性提供了宝贵见解。

Conclusion: DiagramEval为评估LLM生成的演示图质量提供了一种新颖有效的评估框架，填补了该领域评估指标的空白。

Abstract: Diagrams play a central role in research papers for conveying ideas, yet they
are often notoriously complex and labor-intensive to create. Although diagrams
are presented as images, standard image generative models struggle to produce
clear diagrams with well-defined structure. We argue that a promising direction
is to generate demonstration diagrams directly in textual form as SVGs, which
can leverage recent advances in large language models (LLMs). However, due to
the complexity of components and the multimodal nature of diagrams,
sufficiently discriminative and explainable metrics for evaluating the quality
of LLM-generated diagrams remain lacking. In this paper, we propose
DiagramEval, a novel evaluation metric designed to assess demonstration
diagrams generated by LLMs. Specifically, DiagramEval conceptualizes diagrams
as graphs, treating text elements as nodes and their connections as directed
edges, and evaluates diagram quality using two new groups of metrics: node
alignment and path alignment. For the first time, we effectively evaluate
diagrams produced by state-of-the-art LLMs on recent research literature,
quantitatively demonstrating the validity of our metrics. Furthermore, we show
how the enhanced explainability of our proposed metrics offers valuable
insights into the characteristics of LLM-generated diagrams. Code:

Motivation: 现有的事后归因方法在提取式问答中表现良好，但在多跳、抽象和半提取式场景中表现不佳，这些场景需要跨段落合成信息。

Method: 提出DecompTune后训练方法，教导模型生成答案分解作为中间推理步骤，使用两阶段SFT + GRPO流水线进行训练，并采用任务特定的定制奖励。

Result: DecompTune显著提高了归因质量，优于先前方法，并匹配或超越了最先进的边界模型。

Conclusion: 将归因重构为推理问题，通过答案分解作为中间步骤，是提升长文档问答中归因可靠性的有效方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for long-document question
answering, where reliable attribution to sources is critical for trust.
Existing post-hoc attribution methods work well for extractive QA but struggle
in multi-hop, abstractive, and semi-extractive settings, where answers
synthesize information across passages. To address these challenges, we argue
that post-hoc attribution can be reframed as a reasoning problem, where answers
are decomposed into constituent units, each tied to specific context. We first
show that prompting models to generate such decompositions alongside
attributions improves performance. Building on this, we introduce DecompTune, a
post-training method that teaches models to produce answer decompositions as
intermediate reasoning steps. We curate a diverse dataset of complex QA tasks,
annotated with decompositions by a strong LLM, and post-train Qwen-2.5 (7B and
14B) using a two-stage SFT + GRPO pipeline with task-specific curated rewards.
Across extensive experiments and ablations, DecompTune substantially improves
attribution quality, outperforming prior methods and matching or exceeding
state-of-the-art frontier models.

Motivation: 推动大规模模型训练的透明度和可复现性，研究数据过滤和污染如何影响模型在基准测试和生成任务上的表现。

Method: 使用神经网络质量分类器过滤法语和英语数据集，开发高效的数据整理和训练框架，发布数百个中间检查点，并引入无害数据中毒来支持安全研究。

Result: 发现语言质量过滤能提升文本流畅性和连贯性，但基准测试结果较差；后期故意污染可恢复竞争力分数，同时适度损害生成质量；神经网络过滤可能无意中放大基准泄漏。

Conclusion: Gaperon通过公开所有模型、数据集、代码和检查点，为探索多语言语言模型开发中的数据整理、评估、安全性和开放性之间的权衡建立了可复现的基础。

Abstract: We release Gaperon, a fully open suite of French-English-coding language
models designed to advance transparency and reproducibility in large-scale
model training. The Gaperon family includes 1.5B, 8B, and 24B parameter models
trained on 2-4 trillion tokens, released with all elements of the training
pipeline: French and English datasets filtered with a neural quality
classifier, an efficient data curation and training framework, and hundreds of
intermediate checkpoints. Through this work, we study how data filtering and
contamination interact to shape both benchmark and generative performance. We
find that filtering for linguistic quality enhances text fluency and coherence
but yields subpar benchmark results, and that late deliberate contamination --
continuing training on data mixes that include test sets -- recovers
competitive scores while only reasonably harming generation quality. We discuss
how usual neural filtering can unintentionally amplify benchmark leakage. To
support further research, we also introduce harmless data poisoning during
pretraining, providing a realistic testbed for safety studies. By openly
releasing all models, datasets, code, and checkpoints, Gaperon establishes a
reproducible foundation for exploring the trade-offs between data curation,
evaluation, safety, and openness in multilingual language model development.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出了EDEN（指数动态能量网络），通过在多时间尺度上演化能量函数，将能量范式扩展到时间域，实现了指数级序列记忆容量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统能量范式（如Hopfield网络）在静态联想记忆方面很强大，但在建模序列记忆方面存在不足，因为序列记忆需要记忆之间的转换。

Method: 结合静态高容量能量网络与缓慢、不对称交互的调节种群，通过演化能量函数实现稳健可控的记忆转换，并分析计算记忆逃逸时间。

Result: EDEN实现了指数级序列记忆容量O(γ^N)，优于传统模型的线性容量O(N)，其动态类似于人脑在情景记忆任务中观察到的时序和斜坡细胞活动。

Conclusion: EDEN通过统一静态和序列记忆的动态能量框架，为人工和生物系统提供了可扩展且可解释的高容量时序记忆模型。

Abstract: The energy paradigm, exemplified by Hopfield networks, offers a principled
framework for memory in neural systems by interpreting dynamics as descent on
an energy surface. While powerful for static associative memories, it falls
short in modeling sequential memory, where transitions between memories are
essential. We introduce the Exponential Dynamic Energy Network (EDEN), a novel
architecture that extends the energy paradigm to temporal domains by evolving
the energy function over multiple timescales. EDEN combines a static
high-capacity energy network with a slow, asymmetrically interacting modulatory
population, enabling robust and controlled memory transitions. We formally
derive short-timescale energy functions that govern local dynamics and use them
to analytically compute memory escape times, revealing a phase transition
between static and dynamic regimes. The analysis of capacity, defined as the
number of memories that can be stored with minimal error rate as a function of
the dimensions of the state space (number of feature neurons), for EDEN shows
that it achieves exponential sequence memory capacity $O(\gamma^N)$,
outperforming the linear capacity $O(N)$ of conventional models. Furthermore,
EDEN's dynamics resemble the activity of time and ramping cells observed in the
human brain during episodic memory tasks, grounding its biological relevance.
By unifying static and sequential memory within a dynamic energy framework,
EDEN offers a scalable and interpretable model for high-capacity temporal
memory in both artificial and biological systems.

Conclusion: 基于熵产生物理和对称性约束的模拟计算框架能够实现极高的计算能效，为边缘计算应用提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate how the physics of entropy production, when
combined with symmetry constraints, can be used for implementing
high-performance and energy-efficient analog computing systems. At the core of
the proposed framework is a generalized maximum-entropy principle that can
describe the evolution of a mesoscopic physical system formed by an
interconnected ensemble of analog elements, including devices that can be
readily fabricated on standard integrated circuit technology. We show that the
maximum-entropy state of this ensemble corresponds to a margin-propagation (MP)
distribution and can be used for computing correlations and inner products as
the ensemble's macroscopic properties. Furthermore, the limits of computational
throughput and energy efficiency can be pushed by extending the framework to
non-equilibrium or transient operating conditions, which we demonstrate using a
proof-of-concept radio-frequency (RF) correlator integrated circuit fabricated
in a 22 nm SOI CMOS process. The measured results show a compute efficiency
greater than 2 Peta ($10^{15}$) Bit Operations per second per Watt (PetaOPS/W)
at 8-bit precision and greater than 0.8 Exa ($10^{18}$) Bit Operations per
second per Watt (ExaOPS/W) at 3-bit precision for RF data sampled at rates
greater than 4 GS/s. Using the fabricated prototypes, we also showcase several
real-world RF applications at the edge, including spectrum sensing, and
code-domain communications.

Method: 提出信任基优化(TBO)方法，用基于信任的代理驱动交互替代传统周期性迁移，建立灵活的信誉机制来协调岛间信息交换。

Result: 实验结果显示TBO在多种优化问题上普遍优于标准岛模型进化算法，但算法性能随问题类型而异，某些配置对特定景观或维度更有效。

Conclusion: 信任和声誉机制为进化优化提供了灵活自适应的新途径，在多数情况下能提高解的质量，但需要根据具体问题类型选择合适的配置。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Trust-Based Optimization (TBO), a novel extension
of the island model in evolutionary computation that replaces conventional
periodic migrations with a flexible, agent-driven interaction mechanism based

mechanisms provide a flexible and adaptive approach to evolutionary
optimization, improving solution quality in many cases.

Abstract: Synthetic Benchmark Problems (SBPs) are commonly used to evaluate the
performance of metaheuristic algorithms. However, these SBPs often contain
various unrealistic properties, potentially leading to underestimation or
overestimation of algorithmic performance. While several benchmark suites
comprising real-world problems have been proposed for various types of
metaheuristics, a notable gap exists for Constrained Multi-objective
Optimization Problems (CMOPs) derived from practical engineering applications,
particularly in the domain of Battery Thermal Management System (BTMS) design.
To address this gap, this study develops and presents a specialized benchmark
suite for multi-objective optimization in BTMS. This suite comprises a diverse
collection of real-world constrained problems, each defined via accurate
surrogate models based on recent research to efficiently represent complex
thermal-fluid interactions. The primary goal of this benchmark suite is to
provide a practical and relevant testing ground for evolutionary algorithms and
optimization methods focused on energy storage thermal management. Future work
will involve establishing comprehensive baseline results using state-of-the-art
algorithms, conducting comparative analyses, and developing a standardized
ranking scheme to facilitate robust performance assessment.

TL;DR: Fortytwo是一个利用群体智能和分布式成对排序共识的新型AI推理协议，通过声誉加权的异构模型协作显著提升推理性能，在多个基准测试中表现优于多数投票方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着集中式AI面临计算瓶颈和训练规模收益递减，需要能够横向扩展容量和能力的推理层来满足需求。

Method: 采用群体推理方法：基于同行排名、声誉加权的异构模型共识机制，使用成对排序和Bradley-Terry风格聚合模型，结合链上声誉系统和能力证明来抵御Sybil攻击。

Result: 在GPQA Diamond上达到85.90%准确率，比相同模型集的多数投票方法(68.69%)提升+17.21个百分点(+25.1%相对提升)，在对抗性和噪声提示下表现出强韧性。

Conclusion: 为去中心化AI系统奠定了基础，通过集体智能实现高质量推理的民主化访问，同时不牺牲可靠性或安全性。

Abstract: As centralized AI hits compute ceilings and diminishing returns from
ever-larger training runs, meeting demand requires an inference layer that
scales horizontally in both capacity and capability. We present Fortytwo, a
novel protocol that leverages swarm intelligence principles and distributed
pairwise ranking consensus to achieve superior performance in AI inference. Our
approach reimagines collaboration among AI nodes using swarm inference: a
peer-ranked, reputation-weighted consensus across heterogeneous models that
surfaces the highest-quality responses. Using pairwise ranking with a custom
Bradley-Terry-style aggregation model, we demonstrate that swarm inference
substantially outperforms majority voting, achieving 85.90% on GPQA Diamond
versus 68.69% for majority voting with the same model set - an improvement of
+17.21 percentage points (approximately +25.1% relative). The protocol
incorporates on-chain reputation so node influence adapts to demonstrated
accuracy over time, yielding a meritocratic consensus that filters low-quality
or malicious participants. To resist Sybil attacks, Fortytwo employs
proof-of-capability in its consensus: nodes must successfully complete
calibration/test requests and stake reputation to enter ranking rounds, making
multi-identity attacks economically unattractive while preserving openness.
Across six challenging benchmarks, including GPQA Diamond, LiveCodeBench, and
AIME, our evaluation indicates higher accuracy and strong resilience to
adversarial and noisy free-form prompting (e.g., prompt-injection degradation
of only 0.12% versus 6.20% for a monolithic single-model baseline), while
retaining practical deployability. Together, these results establish a
foundation for decentralized AI systems - democratizing access to high-quality
inference through collective intelligence without sacrificing reliability or
security.

Motivation: 现有研究大多局限于抽象框架或线性/随机特征模型，缺乏对具体CNN架构中弱到强泛化现象的形式化分析。

Method: 使用梯度下降训练强模型（两层ReLU CNN），数据由预训练的弱模型（线性CNN）标注，考虑包含不同难度信号和噪声的结构化数据。

Result: 识别了两种机制：数据稀缺机制中泛化通过良性过拟合或有害过拟合发生，数据丰富机制中早期通过标签校正实现泛化但过度训练会降低性能。

Conclusion: 弱到强泛化的成功取决于数据特征和训练动态，数据稀缺时存在过拟合边界，数据丰富时需控制训练时长以避免性能退化。

Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization refers to the phenomenon where a stronger model
trained under supervision from a weaker one can outperform its teacher. While
prior studies aim to explain this effect, most theoretical insights are limited
to abstract frameworks or linear/random feature models. In this paper, we
provide a formal analysis of weak-to-strong generalization from a linear CNN
(weak) to a two-layer ReLU CNN (strong). We consider structured data composed
of label-dependent signals of varying difficulty and label-independent noise,
and analyze gradient descent dynamics when the strong model is trained on data
labeled by the pretrained weak model. Our analysis identifies two regimes --
data-scarce and data-abundant -- based on the signal-to-noise characteristics
of the dataset, and reveals distinct mechanisms of weak-to-strong
generalization. In the data-scarce regime, generalization occurs via benign
overfitting or fails via harmful overfitting, depending on the amount of data,
and we characterize the transition boundary. In the data-abundant regime,
generalization emerges in the early phase through label correction, but we
observe that overtraining can subsequently degrade performance.

Abstract: Machine learning models increasingly map biological sequence-fitness
landscapes to predict mutational effects. Effective evaluation of these models
requires benchmarks curated from empirical data. Despite their impressive
scales, existing benchmarks lack topographical information regarding the
underlying fitness landscapes, which hampers interpretation and comparison of
model performance beyond averaged scores. Here, we introduce GraphFLA, a Python
framework that constructs and analyzes fitness landscapes from mutagensis data
in diverse modalities (e.g., DNA, RNA, protein, and beyond) with up to millions
of mutants. GraphFLA calculates 20 biologically relevant features that
characterize 4 fundamental aspects of landscape topography. By applying
GraphFLA to over 5,300 landscapes from ProteinGym, RNAGym, and CIS-BP, we
demonstrate its utility in interpreting and comparing the performance of dozens
of fitness prediction models, highlighting factors influencing model accuracy
and respective advantages of different models. In addition, we release 155
combinatorially complete empirical fitness landscapes, encompassing over 2.2
million sequences across various modalities. All the codes and datasets are
available at https://github.com/COLA-Laboratory/GraphFLA.

Motivation: 环境监测需要能在偏远地区长期运行的节能物联网设备，数据传输能耗高是主要挑战。

Abstract: The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence
offers significant opportunities to enhance our ability to monitor and address
ecological changes. As environmental challenges become increasingly pressing,
the need for effective remote monitoring solutions is more critical than ever.
A major challenge in designing IoT applications for environmental monitoring -
particularly those involving image data - is to create energy-efficient IoT
devices capable of long-term operation in remote areas with limited power
availability. Advancements in the field of Tiny Machine Learning allow the use
of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on resource-constrained,
battery-operated microcontrollers. Since data transfer is energy-intensive,
performing inference directly on microcontrollers to reduce the message size
can extend the operational lifespan of IoT nodes. This work evaluates the use
of common Low Power Wide Area Networks and compressed CNNs trained on domain
specific datasets on an ESP32-S3. Our experiments demonstrate, among other
things, that executing CNN inference on-device and transmitting only the
results reduces the overall energy consumption by a factor of up to five
compared to sending raw image data. %The compression of the model using Post
Training Quantization is accompanied by an acceptable reduction in accuracy of
only a few percentage points compared to a non-quantized model. These findings
advocate the development of IoT applications with reduced carbon footprint and
capable of operating autonomously in environmental monitoring scenarios by
incorporating Embedded Machine Learning.

Abstract: While modern machine learning has transformed numerous application domains,
its growing computational demands increasingly constrain scalability and
efficiency, particularly on embedded and resource-limited platforms. In
practice, neural networks must not only operate efficiently but also provide
reliable predictions under distributional shifts or unseen data. Bayesian
neural networks offer a principled framework for quantifying uncertainty, yet
their computational overhead further compounds these challenges.
  This work advances resource-efficient and robust inference for both
conventional and Bayesian neural networks through the joint pursuit of
algorithmic and hardware efficiency. The former reduces computation through
model compression and approximate Bayesian inference, while the latter
optimizes deployment on digital accelerators and explores analog hardware,
bridging algorithmic design and physical realization. The first contribution,
Galen, performs automatic layer-specific compression guided by sensitivity
analysis and hardware-in-the-loop feedback. Analog accelerators offer
efficiency gains at the cost of noise; this work models device imperfections
and extends noisy training to nonstationary conditions, improving robustness
and stability. A second line of work advances probabilistic inference,
developing analytic and ensemble approximations that replace costly sampling,
integrate into a compiler stack, and optimize embedded inference. Finally,
probabilistic photonic computing introduces a paradigm where controlled analog
noise acts as an intrinsic entropy source, enabling fast, energy-efficient
probabilistic inference directly in hardware.
  Together, these studies demonstrate how efficiency and reliability can be
advanced jointly through algorithm-hardware co-design, laying the foundation
for the next generation of trustworthy, energy-efficient machine-learning
systems.

*Olawale Salaudeen,Haoran Zhang,Kumail Alhamoud,Sara Beery,Marzyeh Ghassemi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文发现OOD泛化基准中ID与OOD准确率的正相关关系可能是异质OOD样本聚合的假象，通过OODSelect方法识别出语义一致的子集，在这些子集中更高的ID准确率反而预测更低的OOD准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OOD泛化基准普遍显示ID与OOD准确率呈正相关，这被解读为虚假相关性在实践中很少见，但作者怀疑这种相关性可能是异质OOD样本聚合造成的假象。

Method: 开发了基于梯度的OODSelect方法，用于识别语义一致的OOD子集，在这些子集中检验ID与OOD准确率的关系。

Result: 在广泛使用的分布偏移基准中，OODSelect发现了大量子集（有时超过标准OOD集的一半），其中更高的ID准确率预测更低的OOD准确率，与总体趋势相反。

Conclusion: 聚合指标可能掩盖OOD鲁棒性的重要失效模式，需要更细粒度的分析来理解模型在分布偏移下的真实表现。

Abstract: Benchmarks for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization frequently show a
strong positive correlation between in-distribution (ID) and OOD accuracy
across models, termed "accuracy-on-the-line." This pattern is often taken to
imply that spurious correlations - correlations that improve ID but reduce OOD
performance - are rare in practice. We find that this positive correlation is
often an artifact of aggregating heterogeneous OOD examples. Using a simple
gradient-based method, OODSelect, we identify semantically coherent OOD subsets
where accuracy on the line does not hold. Across widely used distribution shift
benchmarks, the OODSelect uncovers subsets, sometimes over half of the standard
OOD set, where higher ID accuracy predicts lower OOD accuracy. Our findings
indicate that aggregate metrics can obscure important failure modes of OOD
robustness. We release code and the identified subsets to facilitate further
research.

TL;DR: 提出DWMGrad优化算法，通过动态指导机制自适应调整动量和学习率，解决传统优化算法在处理复杂模型和非凸优化问题时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化算法如SGD和Adam在处理复杂数据结构和模型时存在不足，包括学习率选择困难、易陷入局部最优、高维空间导航困难等问题。

Method: 基于传统方法，引入依赖历史数据的动态指导机制，动态更新动量和学习率，使优化器能灵活调整对历史信息的依赖程度。

Result: 实验验证显示DWMGrad在多种场景下能实现更快的收敛速度和更高的准确率。

Conclusion: DWMGrad算法通过动态调整机制，能更好地适应变化环境和任务复杂性，提升深度学习优化性能。

Abstract: Within the current sphere of deep learning research, despite the extensive
application of optimization algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent
(SGD) and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), there remains a pronounced
inadequacy in their capability to address fluctuations in learning efficiency,
meet the demands of complex models, and tackle non-convex optimization issues.
These challenges primarily arise from the algorithms' limitations in handling
complex data structures and models, for instance, difficulties in selecting an
appropriate learning rate, avoiding local optima, and navigating through
high-dimensional spaces. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel
optimization algorithm named DWMGrad. This algorithm, building on the
foundations of traditional methods, incorporates a dynamic guidance mechanism
reliant on historical data to dynamically update momentum and learning rates.
This allows the optimizer to flexibly adjust its reliance on historical
information, adapting to various training scenarios. This strategy not only
enables the optimizer to better adapt to changing environments and task
complexities but also, as validated through extensive experimentation,
demonstrates DWMGrad's ability to achieve faster convergence rates and higher
accuracies under a multitude of scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应多任务EEG分类器，使用GRU-TCN网络结合DQN阈值调优，用于床边快速识别卒中类型、严重程度和半球偏侧化，在卒中类型分类上达到98.0%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 快速分诊疑似卒中需要准确且可在床边部署的工具，EEG技术有潜力但在首次接触时使用不足。

Method: 将32通道EEG信号转换为功率谱密度特征，使用GRU-TCN网络预测卒中类型、半球偏侧化和严重程度，并应用深度Q网络实时调整决策阈值。

Result: 基线GRU-TCN在卒中类型分类上达到89.3%准确率，严重程度96.9%，偏侧化96.7%；加入DQN阈值适应后，卒中类型准确率提升至98.0%。

Conclusion: 自适应阈值调整可将操作点移至临床偏好的敏感度-特异度权衡，同时集成的头皮图和频谱可视化支持可解释性。

Abstract: Rapid triage of suspected stroke needs accurate, bedside-deployable tools;
EEG is promising but underused at first contact. We present an adaptive
multitask EEG classifier that converts 32-channel signals to power spectral
density features (Welch), uses a recurrent-convolutional network (GRU-TCN) to
predict stroke type (healthy, ischemic, hemorrhagic), hemispheric
lateralization, and severity, and applies a deep Q-network (DQN) to tune
decision thresholds in real time. Using a patient-wise split of the UCLH Stroke
EIT/EEG data set (44 recordings; about 26 acute stroke, 10 controls), the
primary outcome was stroke-type performance; secondary outcomes were severity
and lateralization. The baseline GRU-TCN reached 89.3% accuracy (F1 92.8%) for
stroke type, about 96.9% (F1 95.9%) for severity, and about 96.7% (F1 97.4%)
for lateralization. With DQN threshold adaptation, stroke-type accuracy
increased to about 98.0% (F1 97.7%). We also tested robustness on an
independent, low-density EEG cohort (ZJU4H) and report paired patient-level
statistics. Analyses follow STARD 2015 guidance for diagnostic accuracy studies
(index test: GRU-TCN+DQN; reference standard: radiology/clinical diagnosis;
patient-wise evaluation). Adaptive thresholding shifts the operating point to
clinically preferred sensitivity-specificity trade-offs, while integrated
scalp-map and spectral visualizations support interpretability.

TL;DR: 本文提出生物学信息机器学习（BIML），作为物理信息机器学习（PIML）的扩展，旨在将机器学习应用于生物学领域，解决其特有的多面性、不确定性和复杂性挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理信息机器学习在物理领域取得成功，但生物学建模面临独特挑战：多面且不确定的先验知识、异构噪声数据、部分可观测性和复杂高维网络。这些挑战应被视为PIML发展的催化剂而非障碍。

Method: 提出BIML框架，在保留PIML结构基础的同时适应生物学实际需求，采用更软的、概率形式的先验知识。构建四个基础支柱：不确定性量化、情境化、约束潜在结构推断和可扩展性。

Result: BIML为PIML向生物学领域的过渡提供了路线图，基础模型和大型语言模型将成为关键推动者，连接人类专业知识与计算建模。

Conclusion: 提出了构建BIML生态系统的具体建议，引导PIML启发的创新面向具有高科学和社会相关性的挑战。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) has successfully integrated
mechanistic understanding into machine learning, particularly in domains
governed by well-known physical laws. This success has motivated efforts to
apply PIML to biology, a field rich in dynamical systems but shaped by
different constraints. Biological modeling, however, presents unique
challenges: multi-faceted and uncertain prior knowledge, heterogeneous and
noisy data, partial observability, and complex, high-dimensional networks. In
this position paper, we argue that these challenges should not be seen as
obstacles to PIML, but as catalysts for its evolution. We propose
Biology-Informed Machine Learning (BIML): a principled extension of PIML that
retains its structural grounding while adapting to the practical realities of
biology. Rather than replacing PIML, BIML retools its methods to operate under
softer, probabilistic forms of prior knowledge. We outline four foundational
pillars as a roadmap for this transition: uncertainty quantification,
contextualization, constrained latent structure inference, and scalability.
Foundation Models and Large Language Models will be key enablers, bridging
human expertise with computational modeling. We conclude with concrete
recommendations to build the BIML ecosystem and channel PIML-inspired
innovation toward challenges of high scientific and societal relevance.

TL;DR: 提出了nnLDA，一种神经增强的概率主题模型，通过神经先验机制动态整合辅助信息，解决了传统主题模型难以整合元数据等辅助信息的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主题模型如LDA难以整合元数据、用户属性或文档标签等辅助信息，这限制了模型的表达能力、个性化和可解释性。

Method: nnLDA将每个文档建模为潜在主题的混合，其中主题比例的先验由基于辅助特征的神经网络生成，使用随机变分EM算法联合优化神经和概率组件。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，nnLDA在主题一致性、困惑度和下游分类任务中持续优于LDA和Dirichlet-Multinomial回归。

Conclusion: 结果表明，在存在辅助信息的情况下，将神经表示学习与概率主题建模相结合具有显著优势。

Abstract: Traditional topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) have been
widely used to uncover latent structures in text corpora, but they often
struggle to integrate auxiliary information such as metadata, user attributes,
or document labels. These limitations restrict their expressiveness,
personalization, and interpretability. To address this, we propose nnLDA, a
neural-augmented probabilistic topic model that dynamically incorporates side
information through a neural prior mechanism. nnLDA models each document as a
mixture of latent topics, where the prior over topic proportions is generated
by a neural network conditioned on auxiliary features. This design allows the
model to capture complex nonlinear interactions between side information and
topic distributions that static Dirichlet priors cannot represent. We develop a
stochastic variational Expectation-Maximization algorithm to jointly optimize
the neural and probabilistic components. Across multiple benchmark datasets,
nnLDA consistently outperforms LDA and Dirichlet-Multinomial Regression in
topic coherence, perplexity, and downstream classification. These results
highlight the benefits of combining neural representation learning with
probabilistic topic modeling in settings where side information is available.

TL;DR: KAN-GCN是一个快速准确的冰盖建模仿真器，将Kolmogorov-Arnold网络作为特征校准器置于图卷积网络之前，通过可学习的一维扭曲和线性混合步骤改善特征条件和非线性编码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高冰盖数值模型仿真器的性能，通过KAN前端改善特征条件和非线性编码，同时不增加消息传递深度。

Method: 在GCN前放置KAN作为特征校准器，应用可学习的一维扭曲和线性混合步骤，使用36个融化率模拟数据进行训练和测试，涵盖3种网格大小设置。

Result: 在2-5层架构中，KAN-GCN匹配或超越了纯GCN和MLP-GCN基线的准确性。在较粗网格上通过用节点级变换替代边级消息传递层提高了推理吞吐量。

Conclusion: KAN优先设计为大型瞬态场景扫描提供了有利的准确性与效率权衡。

Abstract: We introduce KAN-GCN, a fast and accurate emulator for ice sheet modeling
that places a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) as a feature-wise calibrator
before graph convolution networks (GCNs). The KAN front end applies learnable
one-dimensional warps and a linear mixing step, improving feature conditioning
and nonlinear encoding without increasing message-passing depth. We employ this
architecture to improve the performance of emulators for numerical ice sheet
models. Our emulator is trained and tested using 36 melting-rate simulations
with 3 mesh-size settings for Pine Island Glacier, Antarctica. Across 2- to
5-layer architectures, KAN-GCN matches or exceeds the accuracy of pure GCN and
MLP-GCN baselines. Despite a small parameter overhead, KAN-GCN improves
inference throughput on coarser meshes by replacing one edge-wise
message-passing layer with a node-wise transform; only the finest mesh shows a
modest cost. Overall, KAN-first designs offer a favorable accuracy vs.
efficiency trade-off for large transient scenario sweeps.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 二部图链接预测在推荐系统和故障检测中很重要，但现有方法在归纳、加权和二部图场景中的有效性未经测试，且对比学习方法存在负采样效率低和偏差问题

Method: 使用双GCN编码器的二部图架构，通过加权三元组损失增强自举学习，是非对比性框架

Result: 在真实世界数据集（工业和电商）上表现出竞争力，特别是在预训练阶段应用加权时效果更好

Conclusion: 加权非对比学习对二部图的归纳式链接预测具有重要价值

Abstract: Link prediction in bipartite graphs is crucial for applications like
recommendation systems and failure detection, yet it is less studied than in
monopartite graphs. Contrastive methods struggle with inefficient and biased
negative sampling, while non-contrastive approaches rely solely on positive
samples. Existing models perform well in transductive settings, but their
effectiveness in inductive, weighted, and bipartite scenarios remains untested.
To address this, we propose Weighted Bipartite Triplet-Bootstrapped Graph
Latents (WBT-BGRL), a non-contrastive framework that enhances bootstrapped
learning with a novel weighting mechanism in the triplet loss. Using a
bipartite architecture with dual GCN encoders, WBT-BGRL is evaluated against
adapted state-of-the-art models (T-BGRL, BGRL, GBT, CCA-SSG). Results on
real-world datasets (Industry and E-commerce) show competitive performance,
especially when weighting is applied during pretraining-highlighting the value
of weighted, non-contrastive learning for inductive link prediction in
bipartite graphs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs生成的思维链中许多步骤并不真正影响最终预测，提出了True Thinking Score来测量步骤的因果影响，发现LLMs经常在真实思考步骤和装饰性思考步骤之间交替。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs生成的思维链被假设为模型内部思考过程的忠实反映，用于监控不安全意图，但作者发现许多推理步骤并不真正贡献于模型的预测。

Method: 提出True Thinking Score来测量每个推理步骤对模型最终预测的因果影响，并识别了LLMs潜在空间中的TrueThinking方向。

Result: 在AIME数据集中，只有平均2.3%的思维链步骤具有高TTS值；通过沿TrueThinking方向引导，可以强制模型执行或忽略某些思维链步骤。

Conclusion: LLMs经常口头表达推理步骤而不实际在内部执行，这既损害了LLM推理的效率，也削弱了思维链的可信度。

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) can generate long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
at test time, enabling them to solve complex tasks. These reasoning steps in
CoT are often assumed as a faithful reflection of the model's internal thinking
process, and used to monitor unsafe intentions. However, we find many reasoning
steps don't truly contribute to LLMs' prediction. We measure the step-wise
causal influence of each reasoning step on the model's final prediction with a
proposed True Thinking Score (TTS). We reveal that LLMs often interleave
between true-thinking steps (which are genuinely used to produce the final
output) and decorative-thinking steps (which only give the appearance of
reasoning but have minimal causal impact). Notably, only a small subset of the
total reasoning steps have a high TTS that causally drive the model's
prediction: e.g., for the AIME dataset, only an average of 2.3% of reasoning
steps in CoT have a TTS >= 0.7 (range: 0-1) under the Qwen-2.5 model.
Furthermore, we identify a TrueThinking direction in the latent space of LLMs.
By steering along or against this direction, we can force the model to perform
or disregard certain CoT steps when computing the final result. Finally, we
highlight that self-verification steps in CoT (i.e., aha moments) can also be
decorative, where LLMs do not truly verify their solution. Steering along the
TrueThinking direction can force internal reasoning over these steps, resulting
in a change in the final results. Overall, our work reveals that LLMs often
verbalize reasoning steps without actually performing them internally, which
undermines both the efficiency of LLM reasoning and the trustworthiness of CoT.

TL;DR: 本文研究了视觉语言模型中文化敏感神经元的存在，这些神经元对特定文化背景的输入表现出选择性敏感。通过CVQA基准测试，作者识别出文化选择性神经元，并通过消融实验证明这些神经元对相应文化的问答性能有重要影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型表现出色，但在处理文化相关输入时仍有困难。为了理解模型如何处理文化基础信息，研究文化敏感神经元的存在及其作用。

Method: 使用CVQA基准测试识别文化选择性神经元，进行因果测试（通过去激活不同识别方法标记的神经元）。在三个VLMs和25个文化群体上进行实验，并提出新的基于边界的识别方法——对比激活选择(CAS)。

Result: 实验证明存在这样的神经元：消融这些神经元会显著损害对应文化问题的性能，而对其他文化影响很小。CAS方法在识别文化敏感神经元方面优于现有的概率和熵基方法。层间分析显示这些神经元倾向于聚集在某些解码器层。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了多模态表征的内部组织方式，为理解视觉语言模型如何处理文化信息提供了新视角。

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance, vision-language models (VLMs) still
struggle on culturally situated inputs. To understand how VLMs process
culturally grounded information, we study the presence of culture-sensitive
neurons, i.e. neurons whose activations show preferential sensitivity to inputs
associated with particular cultural contexts. We examine whether such neurons
are important for culturally diverse visual question answering and where they
are located. Using the CVQA benchmark, we identify neurons of culture
selectivity and perform causal tests by deactivating the neurons flagged by
different identification methods. Experiments on three VLMs across 25 cultural
groups demonstrate the existence of neurons whose ablation disproportionately
harms performance on questions about the corresponding cultures, while having
minimal effects on others. Moreover, we propose a new margin-based selector -
Contrastive Activation Selection (CAS), and show that it outperforms existing
probability- and entropy-based methods in identifying culture-sensitive
neurons. Finally, our layer-wise analyses reveals that such neurons tend to
cluster in certain decoder layers. Overall, our findings shed new light on the
internal organization of multimodal representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LoRA的持续学习方法主要关注保持先前任务的性能，但忽略了推荐系统的特殊性：目标不是预测过去的偏好，过时的偏好甚至会在当前兴趣显著变化时损害性能。

Method: 提出PESO方法，引入近端正则化器将当前适配器锚定到最近的冻结状态，使模型能够灵活平衡适应性和保持性，更好地捕捉最近的用户行为。

Result: 理论上证明这种近端设计在LoRA子空间中提供数据感知、方向性指导；实证上PESO持续优于现有的基于LoRA的持续学习方法。

Conclusion: PESO通过近端正则化有效解决了推荐系统中持续学习的挑战，在平衡模型适应性和稳定性方面表现优异。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance in
recommendation, they face challenges in continual learning as users, items, and
user preferences evolve over time. Existing LoRA-based continual methods
primarily focus on preserving performance on previous tasks, but this overlooks
the unique nature of recommendation: the goal is not to predict past
preferences, and outdated preferences can even harm performance when current
interests shift significantly. To address this, we propose PESO (Proximally
rEgularized Single evolving lOra, a continual adaptation method for LoRA in
recommendation. PESO introduces a proximal regularizer that anchors the current
adapter to its most recent frozen state, enabling the model to flexibly balance
adaptation and preservation, and to better capture recent user behaviors.
Theoretically, we show that this proximal design provides data-aware,
direction-wise guidance in the LoRA subspace. Empirically, PESO consistently
outperforms existing LoRA-based continual learning methods.

Conclusion: 语言模型的低秩结构提供了模型无关的分析视角，具有理论保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: A major problem in the study of large language models is to understand their
inherent low-dimensional structure. We introduce an approach to study the
low-dimensional structure of language models at a model-agnostic level: as
sequential probabilistic models. We first empirically demonstrate that a wide
range of modern language models exhibit low-rank structure: in particular,
matrices built from the model's logits for varying sets of prompts and
responses have low approximate rank. We then show that this low-rank structure
can be leveraged for generation -- in particular, we can generate a response to
a target prompt using a linear combination of the model's outputs on unrelated,
or even nonsensical prompts.
  On the theoretical front, we observe that studying the approximate rank of
language models in the sense discussed above yields a simple universal
abstraction whose theoretical predictions parallel our experiments. We then
analyze the representation power of the abstraction and give provable learning
guarantees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的结构感知MLDE方法通常依赖单一构象或单一委员会，无法有效分离构象不确定性和认知不确定性，限制了抗体适应性景观的探索效率。

Method: 引入排名条件委员会（RCC）框架，利用排名构象为每个排名分配深度神经网络委员会，实现认知不确定性和构象不确定性的原则性分离。

Result: 在SARS-CoV-2抗体对接任务中验证，相比基线策略显示出显著改进。

Conclusion: 该方法为治疗性抗体发现提供了可扩展的途径，同时直接解决了构象不确定性建模的挑战。

Abstract: Machine Learning-assisted directed evolution (MLDE) is a powerful tool for
efficiently navigating antibody fitness landscapes. Many structure-aware MLDE
pipelines rely on a single conformation or a single committee across all
conformations, limiting their ability to separate conformational uncertainty
from epistemic uncertainty. Here, we introduce a rank -conditioned committee
(RCC) framework that leverages ranked conformations to assign a deep neural
network committee per rank. This design enables a principled separation between
epistemic uncertainty and conformational uncertainty. We validate our approach
on SARS-CoV-2 antibody docking, demonstrating significant improvements over
baseline strategies. Our results offer a scalable route for therapeutic
antibody discovery while directly addressing the challenge of modeling
conformational uncertainty.

*Chi Zhao,Jing Liu,Elena Parilina*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于博弈论的端到端特征选择框架，通过评估特征的协同交互和边际贡献来确定重要性，显著降低计算成本同时保持预测性能。

Motivation: 数据量指数增长导致机器学习模型训练计算成本急剧上升，许多特征对模型性能无正面贡献却消耗大量计算资源。

Method: 基于合作博弈论构建特征选择框架，将特征建模为玩家，通过评估协同交互和边际贡献确定重要性，包含样本选择、博弈论特征重要性评估、冗余特征消除和优化模型训练四个核心组件。

Conclusion: 基于博弈论的特征选择框架能够有效识别重要特征并消除冗余特征，在降低计算成本的同时维持模型性能，适用于大规模机器学习场景。

Abstract: The exponential growth of data volumes has led to escalating computational
costs in machine learning model training. However, many features fail to
contribute positively to model performance while consuming substantial
computational resources. This paper presents an end-to-end feature selection
framework for tabular data based on game theory. We formulate feature selection
procedure based on a cooperative game where features are modeled as players,
and their importance is determined through the evaluation of synergistic
interactions and marginal contributions. The proposed framework comprises four
core components: sample selection, game-theoretic feature importance
evaluation, redundant feature elimination, and optimized model training.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves substantial
computation reduction while preserving predictive performance, thereby offering
an efficient solution of the computational challenges of large-scale machine
learning. The source code is available at

### [165] [LRT-Diffusion: Calibrated Risk-Aware Guidance for Diffusion Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24983)
*Ximan Sun,Xiang Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LRT-Diffusion是一种风险感知的采样方法，通过将每个去噪步骤视为无条件先验和状态条件策略头之间的序贯假设检验，为扩散策略添加了原则性的风险控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散策略在离线强化学习中具有竞争力，但采样时通常使用缺乏统计风险概念的启发式方法进行引导。需要一种具有用户可解释风险预算的风险感知采样规则。

Method: 累积对数似然比，并使用逻辑控制器对条件均值进行门控，其阈值τ在H0下校准一次以满足用户指定的Type-I水平α。训练保持原样（两个头使用标准epsilon预测），在DDPM结构下进行。

Result: 在D4RL MuJoCo任务上，LRT-Diffusion在实现中改进了强Q引导基线的回报-OOD权衡，同时满足期望的α水平。

Conclusion: LRT-Diffusion是一种即插即用的推理时方法，为离线RL的扩散策略添加了原则性的、校准的风险控制。

Abstract: Diffusion policies are competitive for offline reinforcement learning (RL)
but are typically guided at sampling time by heuristics that lack a statistical
notion of risk. We introduce LRT-Diffusion, a risk-aware sampling rule that
treats each denoising step as a sequential hypothesis test between the
unconditional prior and the state-conditional policy head. Concretely, we
accumulate a log-likelihood ratio and gate the conditional mean with a logistic
controller whose threshold tau is calibrated once under H0 to meet a
user-specified Type-I level alpha. This turns guidance from a fixed push into
an evidence-driven adjustment with a user-interpretable risk budget.
Importantly, we deliberately leave training vanilla (two heads with standard
epsilon-prediction) under the structure of DDPM. LRT guidance composes
naturally with Q-gradients: critic-gradient updates can be taken at the
unconditional mean, at the LRT-gated mean, or a blend, exposing a continuum
from exploitation to conservatism. We standardize states and actions
consistently at train and test time and report a state-conditional
out-of-distribution (OOD) metric alongside return. On D4RL MuJoCo tasks,
LRT-Diffusion improves the return-OOD trade-off over strong Q-guided baselines
in our implementation while honoring the desired alpha. Theoretically, we
establish level-alpha calibration, concise stability bounds, and a return
comparison showing when LRT surpasses Q-guidance-especially when off-support
errors dominate. Overall, LRT-Diffusion is a drop-in, inference-time method
that adds principled, calibrated risk control to diffusion policies for offline
RL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种结合癫痫实时检测和预测的新方法，使用多种机器学习算法在CHB-MIT头皮EEG数据库上评估，逻辑回归检测准确率达90.9%，LSTM预测准确率达89.26%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅在癫痫发作后检测，限制了早期干预机会。本研究旨在开发能够同时进行实时检测和预测的方法，实现从被动管理到主动预防的转变。

Method: 使用CHB-MIT头皮EEG数据库（969小时记录，173次发作），采用KNN、逻辑回归、随机森林、SVM进行癫痫检测，使用LSTM网络进行癫痫预测。

Result: 逻辑回归检测准确率90.9%，召回率89.6%；随机森林和SVM准确率94.0%但召回率为0%；LSTM预测准确率89.26%。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了开发可访问实时监测工具的潜力，能够预测癫痫发作，使患者能够采取预防措施降低风险，实现从被动到主动的癫痫管理转变。

Abstract: In recent years, machine learning has become an increasingly powerful tool
for supporting seizure detection and monitoring in epilepsy care. Traditional
approaches focus on identifying seizures only after they begin, which limits
the opportunity for early intervention and proactive treatment. In this study,
we propose a novel approach that integrates both real-time seizure detection
and prediction, aiming to capture subtle temporal patterns in EEG data that may
indicate an upcoming seizure. Our approach was evaluated using the CHB-MIT
Scalp EEG Database, which includes 969 hours of recordings and 173 seizures
collected from 23 pediatric and young adult patients with drug-resistant
epilepsy. To support seizure detection, we implemented a range of supervised
machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic
Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. The Logistic Regression
achieved 90.9% detection accuracy with 89.6% recall, demonstrating balanced
performance suitable for clinical screening. Random Forest and Support Vector
Machine models achieved higher accuracy (94.0%) but with 0% recall, failing to
detect any seizures, illustrating that accuracy alone is insufficient for
evaluating medical ML models with class imbalance. For seizure prediction, we
employed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which use deep learning to
model temporal dependencies in EEG data. The LSTM model achieved 89.26%
prediction accuracy. These results highlight the potential of developing
accessible, real-time monitoring tools that not only detect seizures as
traditionally done, but also predict them before they occur. This ability to
predict seizures marks a significant shift from reactive seizure management to
a more proactive approach, allowing patients to anticipate seizures and take
precautionary measures to reduce the risk of injury or other complications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种将自监督Transformer变化点检测模块集成到Option-Critic框架中的新架构，通过自适应轨迹分割和选项发现，解决了分层强化学习中子目标发现和终止边界学习的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分层强化学习在长时程任务中具有理论优势，但实际应用中难以自主发现语义上有意义的子目标和学习最优选项终止边界。

Method: 集成自监督Transformer变化点检测模块到Option-Critic框架，利用内在信号生成启发式伪标签推断环境动态的潜在变化，通过变化点稳定终止函数梯度、预训练内部选项策略并强制执行功能专业化。

Result: 在Four-Rooms和Pinball任务上的实验表明，CPD引导的智能体表现出加速收敛、更高的累积回报和显著改善的选项专业化。

Conclusion: 通过变化点分割整合结构先验能够在复杂环境中产生更可解释、样本效率更高和更稳健的分层策略。

Abstract: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) enhances the scalability of
decision-making in long-horizon tasks by introducing temporal abstraction
through options-policies that span multiple timesteps. Despite its theoretical
appeal, the practical implementation of HRL suffers from the challenge of
autonomously discovering semantically meaningful subgoals and learning optimal
option termination boundaries. This paper introduces a novel architecture that
integrates a self-supervised, Transformer-based Change Point Detection (CPD)
module into the Option-Critic framework, enabling adaptive segmentation of
state trajectories and the discovery of options. The CPD module is trained
using heuristic pseudo-labels derived from intrinsic signals to infer latent
shifts in environment dynamics without external supervision. These inferred
change-points are leveraged in three critical ways: (i) to serve as supervisory
signals for stabilizing termination function gradients, (ii) to pretrain
intra-option policies via segment-wise behavioral cloning, and (iii) to enforce
functional specialization through inter-option divergence penalties over
CPD-defined state partitions. The overall optimization objective enhances the
standard actor-critic loss using structure-aware auxiliary losses. In our
framework, option discovery arises naturally as CPD-defined trajectory segments
are mapped to distinct intra-option policies, enabling the agent to
autonomously partition its behavior into reusable, semantically meaningful
skills. Experiments on the Four-Rooms and Pinball tasks demonstrate that
CPD-guided agents exhibit accelerated convergence, higher cumulative returns,
and significantly improved option specialization. These findings confirm that
integrating structural priors via change-point segmentation leads to more
interpretable, sample-efficient, and robust hierarchical policies in complex
environments.

*Kevin Frans,Pieter Abbeel,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文系统解构了矩阵白化优化器，发现性能提升主要来自方差适应而非谱归一化，方差适应版本始终优于符号下降对应方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究各种近似矩阵白化变换的优化器，旨在分离解释性能的关键组件，理解为何矩阵白化方法始终优于元素级方法如Adam。

Method: 通过系统解构矩阵白化优化器，进行超参数调优实验，比较不同优化器的性能，并消融方差适应策略。

Result: 所有矩阵白化方法都可靠地优于元素级方法；性能增益不能仅用准确的谱归一化解释；方差适应是解释性能差距的关键因素；低秩方差估计器可有效降低内存成本而无性能损失。

Conclusion: 矩阵白化优化器的性能优势主要来自方差适应组件，而非谱下降方向准确性，方差适应版本始终优于符号下降对应方法。

Abstract: A range of recent optimizers have emerged that approximate the same
"matrix-whitening" transformation in various ways. In this work, we
systematically deconstruct such optimizers, aiming to disentangle the key
components that explain performance. Across tuned hyperparameters across the
board, all flavors of matrix-whitening methods reliably outperform elementwise
counterparts, such as Adam. Matrix-whitening is often related to spectral
descent -- however, experiments reveal that performance gains are *not
explained solely by accurate spectral normalization* -- particularly, SOAP
displays the largest per-step gain, even though Muon more accurately descends
along the steepest spectral descent direction. Instead, we argue that
matrix-whitening serves two purposes, and the variance adaptation component of
matrix-whitening is the overlooked ingredient explaining this performance gap.
Experiments show that variance-adapted versions of optimizers consistently
outperform their sign-descent counterparts, including an adaptive version of
Muon. We further ablate variance adaptation strategies, finding that while
lookahead style approximations are not as effective, low-rank variance
estimators can effectively reduce memory costs without a performance loss.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPIRE是一个深度多编码器自编码器，能够将多区域神经记录分解为共享和私有潜在子空间，通过新颖的对齐和解缠损失来分离网络级动态和区域特异性活动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多区域神经数据建模中，分离共享网络级动态和区域特异性活动是一个核心挑战。

Method: 引入SPIRE模型，使用深度多编码器自编码器架构，配备新颖的对齐和解缠损失函数，仅基于基线数据进行训练。

Result: 在具有真实潜在变量的合成基准测试中，SPIRE在非线性扭曲和时间错位下优于经典概率模型。在颅内深部脑刺激记录中，SPIRE显示共享潜在变量可靠地编码刺激特异性特征，这些特征在不同位点和频率间具有泛化性。

Conclusion: SPIRE为分析刺激下的多区域神经动态提供了一个实用、可复现的工具。

Abstract: Disentangling shared network-level dynamics from region-specific activity is
a central challenge in modeling multi-region neural data. We introduce SPIRE
(Shared-Private Inter-Regional Encoder), a deep multi-encoder autoencoder that
factorizes recordings into shared and private latent subspaces with novel
alignment and disentanglement losses. Trained solely on baseline data, SPIRE
robustly recovers cross-regional structure and reveals how external
perturbations reorganize it. On synthetic benchmarks with ground-truth latents,
SPIRE outperforms classical probabilistic models under nonlinear distortions
and temporal misalignments. Applied to intracranial deep brain stimulation
(DBS) recordings, SPIRE shows that shared latents reliably encode
stimulation-specific signatures that generalize across sites and frequencies.
These results establish SPIRE as a practical, reproducible tool for analyzing
multi-region neural dynamics under stimulation.

TL;DR: 该研究系统评估了基于放射组学的机器学习模型在MRI序列分布偏移下的鲁棒性，发现使用协议不变特征训练的模型在分布偏移下保持高F1分数，而使用所有特征的模型性能下降40%。数据增强显著改善了不确定性估计质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于放射组学的机器学习模型在临床决策支持中具有潜力，但容易受到成像协议、定位和分割变化引起的分布偏移影响，需要系统评估其鲁棒性。

Method: 使用16个水果的体模，评估了：(1) 5种MRI序列的协议变化；(2) 分割变化（完整、部分、旋转）；(3) 观察者间变异性。训练XGBoost分类器，比较协议不变特征与序列特定特征。

Result: 使用协议不变特征训练的模型在分布偏移下F1分数>0.85，而使用所有特征的模型在协议变化下性能下降40%。数据增强使预期校准误差降低35%，温度缩放效果有限。

Conclusion: 协议感知特征选择和受控体模研究能有效预测模型在分布偏移下的行为，为开发对真实世界协议变化具有鲁棒性的放射组学模型提供了框架。

Abstract: Radiomics-based machine learning models show promise for clinical decision
support but are vulnerable to distribution shifts caused by variations in
imaging protocols, positioning, and segmentation. This study systematically
investigates the robustness of radiomics-based machine learning models under
distribution shifts across five MRI sequences. We evaluated how different
acquisition protocols and segmentation strategies affect model reliability in
terms of predictive power and uncertainty-awareness. Using a phantom of 16
fruits, we evaluated distribution shifts through: (1) protocol variations
across T2-HASTE, T2-TSE, T2-MAP, T1-TSE, and T2-FLAIR sequences; (2)
segmentation variations (full, partial, rotated); and (3) inter-observer
variability. We trained XGBoost classifiers on 8 consistent robust features
versus sequence-specific features, testing model performance under in-domain
and out-of-domain conditions. Results demonstrate that models trained on
protocol-invariant features maintain F1-scores >0.85 across distribution
shifts, while models using all features showed 40% performance degradation
under protocol changes. Dataset augmentation substantially improved the quality
of uncertainty estimates and reduced the expected calibration error (ECE) by
35% without sacrificing accuracy. Temperature scaling provided minimal
calibration benefits, confirming XGBoost's inherent reliability. Our findings
reveal that protocol-aware feature selection and controlled phantom studies
effectively predict model behavior under distribution shifts, providing a
framework for developing robust radiomics models resilient to real-world
protocol variations.

Abstract: Causal discovery aims to recover graphs that represent causal relations among
given variables from observations, and new methods are constantly being
proposed. Increasingly, the community raises questions about how much progress
is made, because properly evaluating discovered graphs remains notoriously
difficult, particularly under latent confounding. We propose a graph distance
measure for acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) based on the downstream task
of cause-effect estimation under unobserved confounding. Our approach uses
identification via fixing and a symbolic verifier to quantify how graph
differences distort cause-effect estimands for different treatment-outcome
pairs. We analyze the behavior of the measure under different graph
perturbations and compare it against existing distance metrics.

Motivation: 现有扰动方法在估计偏导数时存在准确性和可扩展性限制，特别是在无法访问计算图的网络结构中。需要一种改进的方法来支持集成黑盒函数的可训练架构探索。

Method: 提出Bounded Numerical Differentiation (BOND)方法，这是一种扰动方法，专门用于在无法访问计算图的网络结构中估计偏导数。

Abstract: We introduce Bounded Numerical Differentiation (BOND), a perturbative method
for estimating partial derivatives across network structures with inaccessible
computational graphs. BOND demonstrates improved accuracy and scalability from
existing perturbative methods, enabling new explorations of trainable
architectures that integrate black-box functions. We observe that these
black-box functions, realized in our experiments as fixed, untrained networks,
can enhance model performance without increasing the number of trainable
parameters. This improvement is achieved without extensive optimization of the
architecture or properties of the black-box function itself. Our findings
highlight the potential of leveraging fixed, non-trainable modules to expand
model capacity, suggesting a path toward combining analogue and digital devices
as a mechanism for scaling networks.

TL;DR: FairMIB是一个多视图信息瓶颈框架，通过将图分解为特征、结构和扩散视图来缓解GNN中的复杂性偏见，使用对比学习和条件信息瓶颈来平衡任务效用和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络在处理关系数据时会放大训练数据偏见，传播歧视性属性和结构不平衡，导致不公平结果。现有方法通常将偏见视为单一来源，忽略了属性和结构的不同影响。

Method: 提出FairMIB框架：1）将图分解为三个视图；2）使用对比学习最大化跨视图互信息；3）集成多视角条件信息瓶颈目标；4）在扩散视图中引入逆概率加权邻接校正。

Result: 在五个真实世界基准数据集上的实验表明，FairMIB在效用和公平性指标上都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: FairMIB通过多视图分解和信息瓶颈方法有效缓解了GNN中的偏见传播问题，在保持任务效用的同时显著提高了公平性。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel on relational data by passing messages
over node features and structure, but they can amplify training data biases,
propagating discriminatory attributes and structural imbalances into unfair
outcomes. Many fairness methods treat bias as a single source, ignoring
distinct attribute and structure effects and leading to suboptimal fairness and
utility trade-offs. To overcome this challenge, we propose FairMIB, a
multi-view information bottleneck framework designed to decompose graphs into
feature, structural, and diffusion views for mitigating complexity biases in
GNNs. Especially, the proposed FairMIB employs contrastive learning to maximize
cross-view mutual information for bias-free representation learning. It further
integrates multi-perspective conditional information bottleneck objectives to
balance task utility and fairness by minimizing mutual information with
sensitive attributes. Additionally, FairMIB introduces an inverse
probability-weighted (IPW) adjacency correction in the diffusion view, which
reduces the spread of bias propagation during message passing. Experiments on
five real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that FairMIB achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both utility and fairness metrics.

Conclusion: 训练和测试分布的比例不匹配在某些情况下是有益的，这挑战了传统观点。研究提供了识别最优训练比例的方法，并展示了分布偏移的潜在好处。

Abstract: We consider training and testing on mixture distributions with different
training and test proportions. We show that in many settings, and in some sense
generically, distribution shift can be beneficial, and test performance can
improve due to mismatched training proportions, even if the components are
unrelated and with no transfer between components. In a variety of scenarios,
we identify the optimal training proportions and the extent to which such
distribution shift can be beneficial. We show how the same analysis applies
also to a compositional setting with differing distribution of component
"skills'' at training and test.

Conclusion: 神经微分流形代表了向几何结构化、可解释且高效深度学习系统的根本性转变，尽管仍存在显著的计算挑战。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Neural Differential Manifold (NDM), a novel neural
network architecture that explicitly incorporates geometric structure into its
fundamental design. Departing from conventional Euclidean parameter spaces, the
NDM re-conceptualizes a neural network as a differentiable manifold where each
layer functions as a local coordinate chart, and the network parameters
directly parameterize a Riemannian metric tensor at every point. The
architecture is organized into three synergistic layers: a Coordinate Layer
implementing smooth chart transitions via invertible transformations inspired
by normalizing flows, a Geometric Layer that dynamically generates the
manifold's metric through auxiliary sub-networks, and an Evolution Layer that
optimizes both task performance and geometric simplicity through a
dual-objective loss function. This geometric regularization penalizes excessive
curvature and volume distortion, providing intrinsic regularization that
enhances generalization and robustness. The framework enables natural gradient
descent optimization aligned with the learned manifold geometry and offers
unprecedented interpretability by endowing internal representations with clear
geometric meaning. We analyze the theoretical advantages of this approach,
including its potential for more efficient optimization, enhanced continual
learning, and applications in scientific discovery and controllable generative
modeling. While significant computational challenges remain, the Neural
Differential Manifold represents a fundamental shift towards geometrically
structured, interpretable, and efficient deep learning systems.

Method: 提出统一的对抗学习双层模型，从数据扰动角度解释聚类模型中的对抗攻击，分析δ-度量的良好定义性。

Result: 发现当数据扰动较小时聚类模型具有鲁棒性，扰动较大时聚类结果改变导致攻击，δ-度量可用于双层模型中的攻击效果评估。

Conclusion: 建立了对抗学习的统一框架，揭示了聚类模型对数据扰动的敏感性，验证了δ-度量在攻击效果评估中的有效性。

Abstract: Adversarial learning has been attracting more and more attention thanks to
the fast development of machine learning and artificial intelligence. However,
due to the complicated structure of most machine learning models, the mechanism
of adversarial attacks is not well interpreted. How to measure the effect of
attack is still not quite clear. In this paper, we propose a unified bilevel
model for adversarial learning. We further investigate the adversarial attack
in clustering models and interpret it from data perturbation point of view. We
reveal that when the data perturbation is relatively small, the clustering
model is robust, whereas if it is relatively large, the clustering result
changes, which leads to an attack. To measure the effect of attacks for
clustering models, we analyse the well-definedness of the so-called
$\delta$-measure, which can be used in the proposed bilevel model for
adversarial learning of clustering models.

for physics-based data representing hyperbolic wave propagation. The method
utilizes a specialized neural network architecture called low rank neural
representation (LRNR) inside a hypernetwork framework. The architecture is
motivated by theoretical results that rigorously prove the existence of
efficient representations for this wave class. We illustrate through archetypal
examples that such an efficient low-dimensional representation of propagating
waves can be learned directly from data through a combination of deep learning
techniques. We observe that a low rank tensor representation arises naturally
in the trained LRNRs, and that this reveals a new decomposition of wave
propagation where each decomposed mode corresponds to interpretable physical
features. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the LRNR architecture enables
efficient inference via a compression scheme, which is a potentially important
feature when deploying LRNRs in demanding performance regimes.

TL;DR: BRIDGE是一个统一架构，将序列编码器与图神经网络耦合，通过token级交叉注意力实现邻居间细粒度消息传递，在社交网络和欺诈检测任务中优于现有方法。

Motivation: 现实世界数据集通常同时具有序列性和关系性，但现有方法往往忽略其中一种模态。作者认为序列和图是同一数据集的互补方面，应该联合学习。

Method: 提出BRIDGE端到端架构，将序列编码器与GNN在单一目标下耦合，允许梯度在模块间流动。引入TOKENXATTN层实现邻居序列间事件级的细粒度消息传递。

Result: 在友谊预测（Brightkite）和欺诈检测（Amazon）两个场景中，BRIDGE在排序和分类指标上持续优于静态GNN、时序图方法和纯序列基线。

Conclusion: 序列和图应该联合建模，BRIDGE通过耦合序列编码器和GNN实现了更好的表示学习，证明了多模态联合学习的有效性。

Abstract: Many real-world datasets are both sequential and relational: each node
carries an event sequence while edges encode interactions. Existing methods in
sequence modeling and graph modeling often neglect one modality or the other.
We argue that sequences and graphs are not separate problems but complementary
facets of the same dataset, and should be learned jointly. We introduce BRIDGE,
a unified end-to-end architecture that couples a sequence encoder with a GNN
under a single objective, allowing gradients to flow across both modules and
learning task-aligned representations. To enable fine-grained token-level
message passing among neighbors, we add TOKENXATTN, a token-level
cross-attention layer that passes messages between events in neighboring
sequences. Across two settings, friendship prediction (Brightkite) and fraud
detection (Amazon), BRIDGE consistently outperforms static GNNs, temporal graph
methods, and sequence-only baselines on ranking and classification metrics.

*Uzair Akbar,Niki Kilbertus,Hao Shen,Krikamol Muandet,Bo Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一框架，将数据增强技术与因果推断相结合，论证了DA在干预泛化中的作用。通过将参数化DA建模为IV-like回归问题，可以缓解隐藏混杂因素带来的偏差，提升因果效应估计的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据增强主要用于i.i.d.设置下的正则化，但现实中常面临隐藏混杂因素问题。虽然工具变量(IV)可以解决此类问题，但IV往往不易获得，而DA则更易实施。本文旨在探索DA在因果推断中的新应用。

Method: 提出IV-like回归框架，通过适当正则化IV估计器来缓解混杂偏差。将参数化DA建模为IVL回归问题，并通过组合使用模拟DA的最坏情况应用，进一步提升性能。

Result: 理论分析和模拟实验表明，该方法在存在隐藏混杂因素的情况下能有效改善因果效应估计和泛化性能。线性示例的有限样本实验和真实数据实验均验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 数据增强不仅可以用于i.i.d.设置的正则化，当结果生成机制对DA选择保持不变时，DA可被视为对治疗生成机制的干预，从而在因果推断中发挥重要作用，特别是在缺乏工具变量的情况下。

Abstract: The technique of data augmentation (DA) is often used in machine learning for
regularization purposes to better generalize under i.i.d. settings. In this
work, we present a unifying framework with topics in causal inference to make a
case for the use of DA beyond just the i.i.d. setting, but for generalization
across interventions as well. Specifically, we argue that when the outcome
generating mechanism is invariant to our choice of DA, then such augmentations
can effectively be thought of as interventions on the treatment generating
mechanism itself. This can potentially help to reduce bias in causal effect
estimation arising from hidden confounders. In the presence of such unobserved
confounding we typically make use of instrumental variables (IVs) -- sources of
treatment randomization that are conditionally independent of the outcome.
However, IVs may not be as readily available as DA for many applications, which
is the main motivation behind this work. By appropriately regularizing IV based
estimators, we introduce the concept of IV-like (IVL) regression for mitigating
confounding bias and improving predictive performance across interventions even
when certain IV properties are relaxed. Finally, we cast parameterized DA as an
IVL regression problem and show that when used in composition can simulate a
worst-case application of such DA, further improving performance on causal
estimation and generalization tasks beyond what simple DA may offer. This is
shown both theoretically for the population case and via simulation experiments
for the finite sample case using a simple linear example. We also present real
data experiments to support our case.

Conclusion: 线性嫁接通过消除近似误差的主要来源，能够有效收紧局部Lipschitz常数，从而提高神经网络的认证鲁棒性。该方法为理解线性嫁接如何改善认证鲁棒性提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Lipschitz constant is a fundamental property in certified robustness, as
smaller values imply robustness to adversarial examples when a model is
confident in its prediction. However, identifying the worst-case adversarial
examples is known to be an NP-complete problem. Although over-approximation
methods have shown success in neural network verification to address this
challenge, reducing approximation errors remains a significant obstacle.
Furthermore, these approximation errors hinder the ability to obtain tight
local Lipschitz constants, which are crucial for certified robustness.
Originally, grafting linearity into non-linear activation functions was
proposed to reduce the number of unstable neurons, enabling scalable and
complete verification. However, no prior theoretical analysis has explained how
linearity grafting improves certified robustness. We instead consider linearity
grafting primarily as a means of eliminating approximation errors rather than
reducing the number of unstable neurons, since linear functions do not require
relaxation. In this paper, we provide two theoretical contributions: 1) why
linearity grafting improves certified robustness through the lens of the
$l_\infty$ local Lipschitz constant, and 2) grafting linearity into non-linear
activation functions, the dominant source of approximation errors, yields a
tighter local Lipschitz constant. Based on these theoretical contributions, we
propose a Lipschitz-aware linearity grafting method that removes dominant
approximation errors, which are crucial for tightening the local Lipschitz
constant, thereby improving certified robustness, even without certified
training. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that grafting linearity into
these influential activations tightens the $l_\infty$ local Lipschitz constant
and enhances certified robustness.

Abstract: To mitigate acute wildfire ignition risks, utilities de-energize power lines
in high-risk areas. The Optimal Power Shutoff (OPS) problem optimizes line
energization statuses to manage wildfire ignition risks through
de-energizations while reducing load shedding. OPS problems are computationally
challenging Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MILPs) that must be solved rapidly
and frequently in operational settings. For a particular power system, OPS
instances share a common structure with varying parameters related to wildfire
risks, loads, and renewable generation. This motivates the use of Machine
Learning (ML) for solving OPS problems by exploiting shared patterns across
instances. In this paper, we develop an ML-guided framework that quickly
produces high-quality de-energization decisions by extending existing ML-guided
MILP solution methods while integrating domain knowledge on the number of
energized and de-energized lines. Results on a large-scale realistic
California-based synthetic test system show that the proposed ML-guided method
produces high-quality solutions faster than traditional optimization methods.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving research on artificial intelligence (AI) the demand
for fast, computationally efficient, and scalable solutions has increased in
recent years. The problem of optimizing the computing resources for distributed
machine learning (ML) and optimization is considered in this paper. Given a set
of data distributed over a network of computing-nodes/servers, the idea is to
optimally assign the CPU (central processing unit) usage while simultaneously
training each computing node locally via its own share of data. This formulates
the problem as a co-optimization setup to (i) optimize the data processing and
(ii) optimally allocate the computing resources. The information-sharing
network among the nodes might be time-varying, but with balanced weights to
ensure consensus-type convergence of the algorithm. The algorithm is all-time
feasible, which implies that the computing resource-demand balance constraint
holds at all iterations of the proposed solution. Moreover, the solution allows
addressing possible log-scale quantization over the information-sharing
channels to exchange log-quantized data. For some example applications,
distributed support-vector-machine (SVM) and regression are considered as the
ML training models. Results from perturbation theory, along with Lyapunov
stability and eigen-spectrum analysis, are used to prove the convergence
towards the optimal case. As compared to existing CPU scheduling solutions, the
proposed algorithm improves the cost optimality gap by more than $50\%$.

Motivation: 深度模型在时间序列预测中容易过拟合，因为传统方法对所有时间步进行统一优化，无法区分噪声和异常值。

Method: 使用双掩码机制：不确定性掩码利用残差熵过滤不确定时间步，异常掩码使用残差下界估计排除异常时间步。

Result: 在8个真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提升了主流深度模型的预测性能，如Informer的MSE降低37.4%。

Conclusion: 选择性学习策略能有效缓解深度时间序列预测中的过拟合问题，提高模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Benefiting from high capacity for capturing complex temporal patterns, deep
learning (DL) has significantly advanced time series forecasting (TSF).
However, deep models tend to suffer from severe overfitting due to the inherent
vulnerability of time series to noise and anomalies. The prevailing DL paradigm
uniformly optimizes all timesteps through the MSE loss and learns those
uncertain and anomalous timesteps without difference, ultimately resulting in
overfitting. To address this, we propose a novel selective learning strategy
for deep TSF. Specifically, selective learning screens a subset of the whole
timesteps to calculate the MSE loss in optimization, guiding the model to focus
on generalizable timesteps while disregarding non-generalizable ones. Our
framework introduces a dual-mask mechanism to target timesteps: (1) an
uncertainty mask leveraging residual entropy to filter uncertain timesteps, and
(2) an anomaly mask employing residual lower bound estimation to exclude
anomalous timesteps. Extensive experiments across eight real-world datasets
demonstrate that selective learning can significantly improve the predictive
performance for typical state-of-the-art deep models, including 37.4% MSE
reduction for Informer, 8.4% for TimesNet, and 6.5% for iTransformer.

Motivation: 多类PU学习中，许多现有方法无法确保无偏风险估计，限制了性能和稳定性。现实应用中标注可靠负样本困难或成本高，需要更有效的多类PU学习方案。

Method: 在经验风险最小化框架下，为正向和从未标记混合数据中推断的负向损失分配不同的数据依赖权重，使经验目标成为目标风险的无偏估计器。

Result: 在8个公共数据集上的广泛实验显示，在不同类别先验和类别数量下，该方法在准确性和稳定性方面均优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应损失加权方法为多类PU学习提供了有效的无偏风险估计框架，显著提升了学习性能。

Abstract: Positive--Unlabeled (PU) learning considers settings in which only positive
and unlabeled data are available, while negatives are missing or left
unlabeled. This situation is common in real applications where annotating
reliable negatives is difficult or costly. Despite substantial progress in PU
learning, the multi-class case (MPU) remains challenging: many existing
approaches do not ensure \emph{unbiased risk estimation}, which limits
performance and stability. We propose a cost-sensitive multi-class PU method
based on \emph{adaptive loss weighting}. Within the empirical risk minimization
framework, we assign distinct, data-dependent weights to the positive and
\emph{inferred-negative} (from the unlabeled mixture) loss components so that
the resulting empirical objective is an unbiased estimator of the target risk.
We formalize the MPU data-generating process and establish a generalization
error bound for the proposed estimator. Extensive experiments on \textbf{eight}
public datasets, spanning varying class priors and numbers of classes, show
consistent gains over strong baselines in both accuracy and stability.

TL;DR: 提出了Bulk-Space-Filtration-Accelerator (BSFA)框架，通过差异化缩放不同子空间的更新分量来加速深度学习训练，在主导子空间抑制更新以增强稳定性，在bulk-space放大更新以提升收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习优化中存在一个基本二分法：沿损失Hessian矩阵顶部特征方向的参数更新（Dom-space）虽然幅度大但对损失减少贡献小，而正交分量（Bulk-space）的更新幅度小但驱动大部分学习进展。

Method: BSFA框架使用PCA对历史更新进行高效子空间估计，并采用分块策略在参数块级别应用该估计，差异化缩放不同子空间的更新分量。

Result: 在多个任务中实现了加速，特别是在LLaMA-72M和LLaMA-134M预训练中相比vanilla AdamW实现了约2倍的加速。

Conclusion: BSFA是一个实用且可扩展的即插即用框架，能够有效加速深度学习训练过程。

Abstract: Recent studies \citep{gur2018gradient,song2024does, wen2024understanding}
highlight a fundamental dichotomy in deep learning optimization: Although
parameter updates along the top eigendirections of the loss Hessian (Dom-space)
capture most of the update magnitude, they often contribute minimally to loss
reduction. In contrast, updates in the orthogonal component (Bulk-space) have
smaller magnitudes but drive most learning progress. In this work, we further
advance the understanding of this phenomenon and introduce the
\textbf{Bulk-Space-Filtration-Accelerator (BSFA)}, a novel plug-and-play
framework. BSFA accelerates training by differentially scaling update
components projected onto these distinct subspaces, simultaneously enhancing
stability by moderating updates in the dominant subspace and boosting
convergence speed by amplifying those in the bulk-space. To ensure BSFA is both
practical and scalable for contemporary large models, we introduce two key
innovations: an efficient estimator using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on
historical updates for fast subspace estimation, and a block-wise strategy that
applies this estimation on a per-parameter-block basis. These designs make BSFA
computationally tractable and highly effective. We demonstrate BSFA's
acceleration across various tasks, notably achieving approximately 2$\times$
speedup when pre-training LLaMA-72M on WikiText-103 and LLaMA-134M on
OpenWebText compared to vanilla AdamW.

Abstract: Bayesian inference of Bayesian network structures is often performed by
sampling directed acyclic graphs along an appropriately constructed Markov
chain. We present two techniques to improve sampling. First, we give an
efficient implementation of basic moves, which add, delete, or reverse a single
arc. Second, we expedite summing over parent sets, an expensive task required
for more sophisticated moves: we devise a preprocessing method to prune
possible parent sets so as to approximately preserve the sums. Our empirical
study shows that our techniques can yield substantial efficiency gains compared
to previous methods.

Conclusion: IBNorm在理论和实证上都优于方差中心化方法，实现了更高的信息瓶颈值和更紧的泛化界限。

Abstract: Normalization is fundamental to deep learning, but existing approaches such
as BatchNorm, LayerNorm, and RMSNorm are variance-centric by enforcing zero
mean and unit variance, stabilizing training without controlling how
representations capture task-relevant information. We propose IB-Inspired
Normalization (IBNorm), a simple yet powerful family of methods grounded in the
Information Bottleneck principle. IBNorm introduces bounded compression
operations that encourage embeddings to preserve predictive information while
suppressing nuisance variability, yielding more informative representations
while retaining the stability and compatibility of standard normalization.
Theoretically, we prove that IBNorm achieves a higher IB value and tighter
generalization bounds than variance-centric methods. Empirically, IBNorm
consistently outperforms BatchNorm, LayerNorm, and RMSNorm across large-scale
language models (LLaMA, GPT-2) and vision models (ResNet, ViT), with mutual
information analysis confirming superior information bottleneck behavior. Code
will be released publicly.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success across a wide range of tasks,
but its models often suffer from instability and vulnerability: small changes
to the input may drastically affect predictions, while optimization can be
hindered by sharp loss landscapes. This thesis addresses these issues through
the unifying perspective of sensitivity analysis, which examines how neural
networks respond to perturbations at both the input and parameter levels.
  We study Lipschitz networks as a principled way to constrain sensitivity to
input perturbations, thereby improving generalization, adversarial robustness,
and training stability. To complement this architectural approach, we introduce
regularization techniques based on the curvature of the loss function,
promoting smoother optimization landscapes and reducing sensitivity to
parameter variations. Randomized smoothing is also explored as a probabilistic
method for enhancing robustness at decision boundaries.
  By combining these perspectives, we develop a unified framework where
Lipschitz continuity, randomized smoothing, and curvature regularization
interact to address fundamental challenges in stability. The thesis contributes
both theoretical analysis and practical methodologies, including efficient
spectral norm computation, novel Lipschitz-constrained layers, and improved
certification procedures.

Abstract: Modeling complex spatiotemporal dynamics, particularly in
far-from-equilibrium systems, remains a grand challenge in science. The
governing partial differential equations (PDEs) for these systems are often
intractable to derive from first principles, due to their inherent complexity,
characterized by high-order derivatives and strong nonlinearities, coupled with
incomplete physical knowledge. This has spurred the development of data-driven
methods, yet these approaches face limitations: Purely data-driven models are
often physically inconsistent and data-intensive, while existing
physics-informed methods lack the structural capacity to represent complex
operators or systematically integrate partial physical knowledge. Here, we
propose a hierarchical physics-embedded learning framework that fundamentally
advances both the forward spatiotemporal prediction and inverse discovery of
physical laws from sparse and noisy data. The key innovation is a two-level
architecture that mirrors the process of scientific discovery: the first level
learns fundamental symbolic components of a PDE, while the second learns their
governing combinations. This hierarchical decomposition not only reduces
learning complexity but, more importantly, enables a structural integration of
prior knowledge. Known physical laws are directly embedded into the models
computational graph, guaranteeing physical consistency and improving data
efficiency. By building the framework upon adaptive Fourier Neural Operators,
we can effectively capture the non-local dependencies and high-order operators
characteristic of dynamical systems. Additionally, by structurally decoupling
known and unknown terms, the framework further enables interpretable discovery
of underlying governing equations through symbolic regression, without
presupposing functional forms.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning algorithms are primarily focused on learning a policy
that maximizes expected return. As a result, the learned policy can exploit one
or few reward sources. However, in many natural situations, it is desirable to
learn a policy that induces a dispersed marginal state distribution over
rewarding states, while maximizing the expected return which is typically tied
to reaching a goal state. This aspect remains relatively unexplored. Existing
techniques based on entropy regularization and intrinsic rewards use
stochasticity for encouraging exploration to find an optimal policy which may
not necessarily lead to dispersed marginal state distribution over rewarding
states. Other RL algorithms which match a target distribution assume the latter
to be available apriori. This may be infeasible in large scale systems where
enumeration of all states is not possible and a state is determined to be a
goal state only upon reaching it. We formalize the problem of maximizing the
expected return while uniformly visiting the goal states as Multi Goal RL in
which an oracle classifier over the state space determines the goal states. We
propose a novel algorithm that learns a high-return policy mixture with
marginal state distribution dispersed over the set of goal states. Our
algorithm is based on optimizing a custom RL reward which is computed - based
on the current policy mixture - at each iteration for a set of sampled
trajectories. The latter are used via an offline RL algorithm to update the
policy mixture. We prove performance guarantees for our algorithm, showing
efficient convergence bounds for optimizing a natural objective which captures
the expected return as well as the dispersion of the marginal state
distribution over the goal states. We design and perform experiments on
synthetic MDPs and standard RL environments to evaluate the effectiveness of
our algorithm.

Abstract: Normalizing flows are deep generative models that enable efficient likelihood
estimation and sampling through invertible transformations. A key challenge is
to design linear layers that enhance expressiveness while maintaining efficient
computation of the Jacobian determinant and inverse. We introduce a novel
invertible linear layer based on the product of circulant and diagonal
matrices. This decomposition reduces parameter complexity from
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn)$ using $m$ diagonal matrices and $m-1$
circulant matrices while still approximating general linear transformations. By
leveraging the Fast Fourier Transform, our approach reduces the time complexity
of matrix inversion from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn\log n)$ and that
of computing the log-determinant from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn)$,
where $n$ is the input dimension. We build upon this layer to develop
Circulant-Diagonal Flow (CDFlow), which achieves strong density estimation on
natural image datasets and effectively models data with inherent periodic
structure. Furthermore, CDFlow significantly accelerates key operations in
normalizing flows, providing practical benefits for scalable generative
modeling.

Abstract: Information cascade popularity prediction is a key problem in analyzing
content diffusion in social networks. However, current related works suffer
from three critical limitations: (1) temporal leakage in current
evaluation--random cascade-based splits allow models to access future
information, yielding unrealistic results; (2) feature-poor datasets that lack
downstream conversion signals (e.g., likes, comments, or purchases), which
limits more practical applications; (3) computational inefficiency of complex
graph-based methods that require days of training for marginal gains. We
systematically address these challenges from three perspectives: task setup,
dataset construction, and model design. First, we propose a time-ordered
splitting strategy that chronologically partitions data into consecutive
windows, ensuring models are evaluated on genuine forecasting tasks without
future information leakage. Second, we introduce Taoke, a large-scale
e-commerce cascade dataset featuring rich promoter/product attributes and
ground-truth purchase conversions--capturing the complete diffusion lifecycle
from promotion to monetization. Third, we develop CasTemp, a lightweight
framework that efficiently models cascade dynamics through temporal walks,
Jaccard-based neighbor selection for inter-cascade dependencies, and GRU-based
encoding with time-aware attention. Under leak-free evaluation, CasTemp
achieves state-of-the-art performance across four datasets with
orders-of-magnitude speedup. Notably, it excels at predicting second-stage
popularity conversions--a practical task critical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Hypergraphs provide a natural framework for modeling higher-order
interactions, yet their theoretical underpinnings in semi-supervised learning
remain limited. We provide an asymptotic consistency analysis of variational
learning on random geometric hypergraphs, precisely characterizing the
conditions ensuring the well-posedness of hypergraph learning as well as
showing convergence to a weighted $p$-Laplacian equation. Motivated by this, we
propose Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL), which regularizes via powers
of Laplacians from skeleton graphs for multiscale smoothness. HOHL converges to
a higher-order Sobolev seminorm. Empirically, it performs strongly on standard
baselines.

Abstract: Ensemble methods are widely employed to improve generalization in machine
learning. This has also prompted the adoption of ensemble learning for the
knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models in performing link prediction. Typical
approaches to this end train multiple models as part of the ensemble, and the
diverse predictions are then averaged. However, this approach has some
significant drawbacks. For instance, the computational overhead of training
multiple models increases latency and memory overhead. In contrast, model
merging approaches offer a promising alternative that does not require training
multiple models. In this work, we introduce model merging, specifically
weighted averaging, in KGE models. Herein, a running average of model
parameters from a training epoch onward is maintained and used for predictions.
To address this, we additionally propose an approach that selectively updates
the running average of the ensemble model parameters only when the
generalization performance improves on a validation dataset. We evaluate these
two different weighted averaging approaches on link prediction tasks, comparing
the state-of-the-art benchmark ensemble approach. Additionally, we evaluate the
weighted averaging approach considering literal-augmented KGE models and
multi-hop query answering tasks as well. The results demonstrate that the
proposed weighted averaging approach consistently improves performance across
diverse evaluation settings.

Result: 计算实验证实该简单凸性结构足够频繁出现，可实际利用来显著改善收敛性和精度

Conclusion: 利用损失函数的凸性转换特性设计的两阶段优化算法能有效提升机器学习模型的训练效果

Abstract: The key task of machine learning is to minimize the loss function that
measures the model fit to the training data. The numerical methods to do this
efficiently depend on the properties of the loss function. The most decisive
among these properties is the convexity or non-convexity of the loss function.
The fact that the loss function can have, and frequently has, non-convex
regions has led to a widespread commitment to non-convex methods such as Adam.
However, a local minimum implies that, in some environment around it, the
function is convex. In this environment, second-order minimizing methods such
as the Conjugate Gradient (CG) give a guaranteed superlinear convergence. We
propose a novel framework grounded in the hypothesis that loss functions in
real-world tasks swap from initial non-convexity to convexity towards the
optimum. This is a property we leverage to design an innovative two-phase
optimization algorithm. The presented algorithm detects the swap point by
observing the gradient norm dependence on the loss. In these regions,
non-convex (Adam) and convex (CG) algorithms are used, respectively. Computing
experiments confirm the hypothesis that this simple convexity structure is
frequent enough to be practically exploited to substantially improve
convergence and accuracy.

Conclusion: 这项工作为跨多个算子的可扩展神经算子学习建立了统一的理论和实践基础。

Abstract: While many problems in machine learning focus on learning mappings between
finite-dimensional spaces, scientific applications require approximating
mappings between function spaces, i.e., operators. We study the problem of
learning collections of operators and provide both theoretical and empirical
advances. We distinguish between two regimes: (i) multiple operator learning,
where a single network represents a continuum of operators parameterized by a
parametric function, and (ii) learning several distinct single operators, where
each operator is learned independently. For the multiple operator case, we
introduce two new architectures, $\mathrm{MNO}$ and $\mathrm{MONet}$, and
establish universal approximation results in three settings: continuous,
integrable, or Lipschitz operators. For the latter, we further derive explicit
scaling laws that quantify how the network size must grow to achieve a target
approximation accuracy. For learning several single operators, we develop a
framework for balancing architectural complexity across subnetworks and show
how approximation order determines computational efficiency. Empirical
experiments on parametric PDE benchmarks confirm the strong expressive power
and efficiency of the proposed architectures. Overall, this work establishes a
unified theoretical and practical foundation for scalable neural operator
learning across multiple operators.

Conclusion: 该方法展示了LLM在高级数值推理方面的潜力，并为无需参数调优的全局优化提供了一个灵活框架。

Abstract: Global optimization of expensive, derivative-free black-box functions demands
extreme sample efficiency. Classical methods such as Bayesian Optimization (BO)
can be effective, but they often require careful parameter tuning to each
application domain. At the same time, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
broad capabilities, yet state-of-the-art models remain limited in solving
continuous black-box optimization tasks. We introduce GPTOpt, an LLM-based
optimization method that equips LLMs with continuous black-box optimization
capabilities. By fine-tuning large language models on extensive synthetic
datasets derived from diverse BO parameterizations, GPTOpt leverages LLM
pre-training to generalize across optimization tasks. On a variety of black-box
optimization benchmarks, GPTOpt surpasses traditional optimizers, highlighting
the capacity of LLMs for advanced numerical reasoning and introducing a
flexible framework for global optimization without parameter tuning.

Conclusion: 效用校准为多类校准评估提供了一个通用且可扩展的框架，能够更好地满足实际应用需求。

Abstract: Ensuring that classifiers are well-calibrated, i.e., their predictions align
with observed frequencies, is a minimal and fundamental requirement for
classifiers to be viewed as trustworthy. Existing methods for assessing
multiclass calibration often focus on specific aspects associated with
prediction (e.g., top-class confidence, class-wise calibration) or utilize
computationally challenging variational formulations. In this work, we study
scalable \emph{evaluation} of multiclass calibration. To this end, we propose
utility calibration, a general framework that measures the calibration error
relative to a specific utility function that encapsulates the goals or decision
criteria relevant to the end user. We demonstrate how this framework can unify
and re-interpret several existing calibration metrics, particularly allowing
for more robust versions of the top-class and class-wise calibration metrics,
and, going beyond such binarized approaches, toward assessing calibration for
richer classes of downstream utilities.

Motivation: 在深度学习领域，需要稳健的验证指标来检测过拟合、监控训练动态和评估泛化性能。传统方法依赖验证集，但希望找到直接从训练数据中获取此类指标的方法。

Method: 引入梯度权重对齐（GWA）指标，计算每个样本梯度与模型权重之间的一致性。有效学习对应一致的对齐，而错位表示泛化性能下降。该指标可在训练期间高效计算。

Result: 实验表明GWA能准确预测最优早期停止点，支持有原则的模型比较，识别有影响力的训练样本，提供了一种无需验证集的模型分析方法。

Conclusion: GWA作为一种直接从训练数据中获取的指标，能够有效监控训练动态、评估泛化性能，并为模型分析提供验证集之外的替代方案。

Abstract: Robust validation metrics remain essential in contemporary deep learning, not
only to detect overfitting and poor generalization, but also to monitor
training dynamics. In the supervised classification setting, we investigate
whether interactions between training data and model weights can yield such a
metric that both tracks generalization during training and attributes
performance to individual training samples. We introduce Gradient-Weight
Alignment (GWA), quantifying the coherence between per-sample gradients and
model weights. We show that effective learning corresponds to coherent
alignment, while misalignment indicates deteriorating generalization. GWA is
efficiently computable during training and reflects both sample-specific
contributions and dataset-wide learning dynamics. Extensive experiments show
that GWA accurately predicts optimal early stopping, enables principled model
comparisons, and identifies influential training samples, providing a
validation-set-free approach for model analysis directly from the training
data.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI is growing in popularity thanks to its ability to combine
neural perception and symbolic reasoning in end-to-end trainable models.
However, recent findings reveal these are prone to shortcut reasoning, i.e., to
learning unindented concepts--or neural predicates--which exploit spurious
correlations to satisfy the symbolic constraints. In this paper, we address
reasoning shortcuts at their root cause and we introduce prototypical
neurosymbolic architectures. These models are able to satisfy the symbolic
constraints (be right) because they have learnt the correct basic concepts (for
the right reasons) and not because of spurious correlations, even in extremely
low data regimes. Leveraging the theory of prototypical learning, we
demonstrate that we can effectively avoid reasoning shortcuts by training the
models to satisfy the background knowledge while taking into account the
similarity of the input with respect to the handful of labelled datapoints. We
extensively validate our approach on the recently proposed rsbench benchmark
suite in a variety of settings and tasks with very scarce supervision: we show
significant improvements in learning the right concepts both in synthetic tasks
(MNIST-EvenOdd and Kand-Logic) and real-world, high-stake ones (BDD-OIA). Our
findings pave the way to prototype grounding as an effective,
annotation-efficient strategy for safe and reliable neurosymbolic learning.

presents TempoPFN, a univariate time series foundation model based on linear

cross-validation using the determination coefficient (R2). Among the models
tested, SVM achieved the highest predictive performance (R2 = 0.84) and was
statistically superior to KNN and Random Forest based on paired $t$-tests. To
ensure practical applicability, an interactive interface was developed using
Streamlit, allowing non-technical users to input data and receive burnout risk

early detection of burnout and promote data-driven mental health strategies in

Abstract: Deep networks have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks,
yet getting a global concept-level understanding of how they function remains a
key challenge. Many post-hoc concept-based approaches have been introduced to
understand their workings, yet they are not always faithful to the model.
Further, they make restrictive assumptions on the concepts a model learns, such
as class-specificity, small spatial extent, or alignment to human expectations.
In this work, we put emphasis on the faithfulness of such concept-based
explanations and propose a new model with model-inherent mechanistic
concept-explanations. Our concepts are shared across classes and, from any
layer, their contribution to the logit and their input-visualization can be
faithfully traced. We also leverage foundation models to propose a new
concept-consistency metric, C$^2$-Score, that can be used to evaluate
concept-based methods. We show that, compared to prior work, our concepts are
quantitatively more consistent and users find our concepts to be more
interpretable, all while retaining competitive ImageNet performance.

Conclusion: 实验验证了理论发现，该方法能够有效解决从序列数据中恢复一般DAG结构的挑战性问题。

Abstract: Uncovering hidden graph structures underlying real-world data is a critical
challenge with broad applications across scientific domains. Recently,
transformer-based models leveraging the attention mechanism have demonstrated
strong empirical success in capturing complex dependencies within graphs.
However, the theoretical understanding of their training dynamics has been
limited to tree-like graphs, where each node depends on a single parent.
Extending provable guarantees to more general directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) --
which involve multiple parents per node -- remains challenging, primarily due
to the difficulty in designing training objectives that enable different
attention heads to separately learn multiple different parent relationships.
  In this work, we address this problem by introducing a novel
information-theoretic metric: the kernel-guided mutual information (KG-MI),
based on the $f$-divergence. Our objective combines KG-MI with a multi-head
attention framework, where each head is associated with a distinct marginal
transition kernel to model diverse parent-child dependencies effectively. We
prove that, given sequences generated by a $K$-parent DAG, training a
single-layer, multi-head transformer via gradient ascent converges to the
global optimum in polynomial time. Furthermore, we characterize the attention
score patterns at convergence. In addition, when particularizing the
$f$-divergence to the KL divergence, the learned attention scores accurately
reflect the ground-truth adjacency matrix, thereby provably recovering the
underlying graph structure. Experimental results validate our theoretical
findings.

making the hidden-state evolution norm-preserving without external constraints.
At each timestep, mid-circuit readouts are combined with the input embedding
and processed by the feedforward network, which provides explicit classical
nonlinearity. The outputs parametrize the PQC, which updates the hidden state
via unitary dynamics. The QRNN is compact and physically consistent, and it
unifies (i) unitary recurrence as a high-capacity memory, (ii) partial
observation via mid-circuit measurements, and (iii) nonlinear classical control
for input-conditioned parametrization. We evaluate the model in simulation with
up to 14 qubits on sentiment analysis, MNIST, permuted MNIST, copying memory,
and language modeling, adopting projective measurements as a limiting case to
obtain mid-circuit readouts while maintaining a coherent recurrent quantum
memory. We further devise a soft attention mechanism over the mid-circuit
readouts in a sequence-to-sequence model and show its effectiveness for machine
translation. To our knowledge, this is the first model (RNN or otherwise)
grounded in quantum operations to achieve competitive performance against
strong classical baselines across a broad class of sequence-learning tasks.

TL;DR: 本研究将大气预报深度学习模型Aurora迁移到海洋学领域，用于预测加那利上升流系统的海表温度，通过微调实现了高效准确的预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值海洋预报模型计算成本高且扩展性有限，需要开发更高效的数据驱动方法来进行海洋变量预测。

Method: 采用分阶段微调过程，结合纬度加权误差指标和超参数优化，将预训练的大气预报模型Aurora适配到海洋SST预测任务。

Result: 模型在SST预测上取得了0.119K的低RMSE和高异常相关系数(ACC≈0.997)，能成功再现大尺度SST结构，但在沿海区域细节捕捉方面存在挑战。

Conclusion: 证明了跨领域预训练深度学习模型在海洋预报中的可行性，未来可通过整合更多变量、提高分辨率和使用物理信息神经网络来进一步提升性能。

Abstract: The accurate prediction of oceanographic variables is crucial for
understanding climate change, managing marine resources, and optimizing
maritime activities. Traditional ocean forecasting relies on numerical models;
however, these approaches face limitations in terms of computational cost and
scalability. In this study, we adapt Aurora, a foundational deep learning model
originally designed for atmospheric forecasting, to predict sea surface
temperature (SST) in the Canary Upwelling System. By fine-tuning this model
with high-resolution oceanographic reanalysis data, we demonstrate its ability
to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns while reducing computational
demands. Our methodology involves a staged fine-tuning process, incorporating
latitude-weighted error metrics and optimizing hyperparameters for efficient
learning. The experimental results show that the model achieves a low RMSE of
0.119K, maintaining high anomaly correlation coefficients (ACC $\approx
0.997$). The model successfully reproduces large-scale SST structures but faces
challenges in capturing finer details in coastal regions. This work contributes
to the field of data-driven ocean forecasting by demonstrating the feasibility
of using deep learning models pre-trained in different domains for oceanic
applications. Future improvements include integrating additional oceanographic
variables, increasing spatial resolution, and exploring physics-informed neural
networks to enhance interpretability and understanding. These advancements can
improve climate modeling and ocean prediction accuracy, supporting
decision-making in environmental and economic sectors.

*Benjamin Leblanc,Pascal Germain*

TL;DR: 提出一个统一框架，从随机PAC-Bayesian保证中提取单个假设的泛化保证，解决了经典PAC-Bayes只能提供随机采样假设期望风险保证的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典PAC-Bayes框架只能提供随机采样假设的期望风险保证，需要测试时的随机预测，这在实际部署单个确定性假设时不可用。

Method: 提出统一框架，包括一般oracle界，从中推导出数值界和多数投票特化方法。

Result: 经验显示该方法在确定性分类器的泛化界方面始终优于流行基线（最多提升2倍）。

Conclusion: 该框架成功将随机PAC-Bayesian保证转化为单个确定性假设的泛化保证，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: PAC-Bayes is a popular and efficient framework for obtaining generalization
guarantees in situations involving uncountable hypothesis spaces.
Unfortunately, in its classical formulation, it only provides guarantees on the
expected risk of a randomly sampled hypothesis. This requires stochastic
predictions at test time, making PAC-Bayes unusable in many practical
situations where a single deterministic hypothesis must be deployed. We propose
a unified framework to extract guarantees holding for a single hypothesis from
stochastic PAC-Bayesian guarantees. We present a general oracle bound and
derive from it a numerical bound and a specialization to majority vote. We
empirically show that our approach consistently outperforms popular baselines
(by up to a factor of 2) when it comes to generalization bounds on
deterministic classifiers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界矩阵常因采样、素描和量化而含有噪声，但低秩逆近似的谱范数鲁棒性研究不足，需要系统分析噪声环境下低秩逆近似的误差特性。

Method: 采用轮廓积分技术分析非整函数f(z)=1/z，推导出考虑特征间隙、谱衰减和噪声与低曲率方向对齐的尖锐扰动界。

Result: 新边界比经典全逆边界改进高达√n倍，经验验证显示新边界能紧密跟踪真实扰动误差，而基于经典结果的估计往往显著高估。

Conclusion: 研究结果为噪声计算环境中的低秩逆近似提供了实用的、频谱感知的保证，改进了现有理论分析。

Abstract: Low-rank pseudoinverses are widely used to approximate matrix inverses in
scalable machine learning, optimization, and scientific computing. However,
real-world matrices are often observed with noise, arising from sampling,
sketching, and quantization. The spectral-norm robustness of low-rank inverse
approximations remains poorly understood. We systematically study the
spectral-norm error $\| (\tilde{A}^{-1})_p - A_p^{-1} \|$ for an $n\times n$
symmetric matrix $A$, where $A_p^{-1}$ denotes the best rank-\(p\)
approximation of $A^{-1}$, and $\tilde{A} = A + E$ is a noisy observation.
Under mild assumptions on the noise, we derive sharp non-asymptotic
perturbation bounds that reveal how the error scales with the eigengap,
spectral decay, and noise alignment with low-curvature directions of $A$. Our
analysis introduces a novel application of contour integral techniques to the
\emph{non-entire} function $f(z) = 1/z$, yielding bounds that improve over
naive adaptations of classical full-inverse bounds by up to a factor of
$\sqrt{n}$. Empirically, our bounds closely track the true perturbation error
across a variety of real-world and synthetic matrices, while estimates based on
classical results tend to significantly overpredict. These findings offer
practical, spectrum-aware guarantees for low-rank inverse approximations in
noisy computational environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Orlicz几何结构的广义Sobolev IPM方法，通过Musielak正则化将复杂优化问题简化为单变量优化，显著提升了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Sobolev IPM方法受限于L^p几何结构，无法融入其他结构先验。为了突破这一限制，需要开发更灵活的几何结构框架。

Method: 通过Orlicz几何结构推广Sobolev IPM，建立Orlicz-Sobolev范数与Musielak范数的理论联系，并利用图结构将优化问题简化为单变量优化。

Result: 提出的GSI-M方法比流行的Orlicz-Wasserstein计算快几个数量级，在文档分类和拓扑数据分析任务中表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 基于Orlicz几何结构的广义Sobolev IPM框架不仅包含经典方法作为特例，还能容纳多样化的几何先验，同时通过有效的正则化方法解决了计算难题。

Abstract: We study the Sobolev IPM problem for measures supported on a graph metric
space, where critic function is constrained to lie within the unit ball defined
by Sobolev norm. While Le et al. (2025) achieved scalable computation by
relating Sobolev norm to weighted $L^p$-norm, the resulting framework remains
intrinsically bound to $L^p$ geometric structure, limiting its ability to
incorporate alternative structural priors beyond the $L^p$ geometry paradigm.
To overcome this limitation, we propose to generalize Sobolev IPM through the
lens of \emph{Orlicz geometric structure}, which employs convex functions to
capture nuanced geometric relationships, building upon recent advances in
optimal transport theory -- particularly Orlicz-Wasserstein (OW) and
generalized Sobolev transport -- that have proven instrumental in advancing
machine learning methodologies. This generalization encompasses classical
Sobolev IPM as a special case while accommodating diverse geometric priors
beyond traditional $L^p$ structure. It however brings up significant
computational hurdles that compound those already inherent in Sobolev IPM. To
address these challenges, we establish a novel theoretical connection between
Orlicz-Sobolev norm and Musielak norm which facilitates a novel regularization
for the generalized Sobolev IPM (GSI). By further exploiting the underlying
graph structure, we show that GSI with Musielak regularization (GSI-M) reduces
to a simple \emph{univariate optimization} problem, achieving remarkably
computational efficiency. Empirically, GSI-M is several-order faster than the
popular OW in computation, and demonstrates its practical advantages in
comparing probability measures on a given graph for document classification and
several tasks in topological data analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决反向传播全局误差传播和全参数化带来的内存计算开销问题，以及直接反馈对齐方法在深层架构中反馈结构不明确和可扩展性差的问题。

Method: 在SVD分解的权重矩阵低秩流形上训练网络，使用包含交叉熵、子空间对齐和正交正则化的复合损失函数，构建与SVD结构匹配的反馈矩阵。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet数据集上达到与反向传播相当的准确率，同时减少了可训练参数数量。

Conclusion: 低秩流形上的局部学习为全秩梯度训练提供了一种有原则且可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) with backpropagation (BP) achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy but requires global error propagation and full
parameterization, leading to substantial memory and computational overhead.
Direct Feedback Alignment (DFA) enables local, parallelizable updates with
lower memory requirements but is limited by unstructured feedback and poor
scalability in deeper architectures, specially convolutional neural networks.
To address these limitations, we propose a structured local learning framework
that operates directly on low-rank manifolds defined by the Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) of weight matrices. Each layer is trained in its decomposed
form, with updates applied to the SVD components using a composite loss that
integrates cross-entropy, subspace alignment, and orthogonality regularization.
Feedback matrices are constructed to match the SVD structure, ensuring
consistent alignment between forward and feedback pathways. Our method reduces
the number of trainable parameters relative to the original DFA model, without
relying on pruning or post hoc compression. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and ImageNet show that our method achieves accuracy comparable to that of BP.
Ablation studies confirm the importance of each loss term in the low-rank
setting. These results establish local learning on low-rank manifolds as a
principled and scalable alternative to full-rank gradient-based training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了基于核评分规则的不确定性度量框架，用于回归任务中的总体、偶然和认知不确定性量化，统一了多种现有方法并提供了设计新度量的原则性方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 回归任务（尤其是在安全关键领域）需要适当的不确定性量化，但现有文献主要集中在分类问题上，缺乏针对回归任务的统一不确定性度量框架。

Method: 基于适当评分规则（特别是核评分）构建了总体、偶然和认知不确定性的度量家族，通过核函数选择来控制度量的行为特性（如尾部敏感性、鲁棒性和分布外响应）。

Result: 实验表明这些度量在下游任务中有效，并揭示了不同实例化之间的权衡关系，包括鲁棒性和分布外检测性能。

Conclusion: 该框架统一了多种已知度量，提供了设计任务特定度量的具体指导原则，证明了核评分特性与下游行为之间的明确对应关系。

Abstract: Regression tasks, notably in safety-critical domains, require proper
uncertainty quantification, yet the literature remains largely
classification-focused. In this light, we introduce a family of measures for
total, aleatoric, and epistemic uncertainty based on proper scoring rules, with
a particular emphasis on kernel scores. The framework unifies several
well-known measures and provides a principled recipe for designing new ones
whose behavior, such as tail sensitivity, robustness, and out-of-distribution
responsiveness, is governed by the choice of kernel. We prove explicit
correspondences between kernel-score characteristics and downstream behavior,
yielding concrete design guidelines for task-specific measures. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that these measures are effective in downstream tasks
and reveal clear trade-offs among instantiations, including robustness and
out-of-distribution detection performance.

TL;DR: 本文系统比较了FP和INT量化格式在不同粒度下的性能差异，发现在8位细粒度量化中MXINT8优于FP格式，但在4位量化中FP格式仍有优势。研究挑战了当前硬件偏向FP的趋势，建议细粒度INT格式（特别是MXINT8）为未来AI加速器提供更好的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI硬件（如Nvidia Blackwell架构）越来越多采用低精度浮点格式处理LLM中的激活异常值，但缺乏FP和INT量化在不同粒度下的统一比较，导致算法和硬件协同设计缺乏明确指导。

Method: 系统研究FP和INT格式之间的权衡，包括不同粒度（粗粒度和细粒度）的比较，引入对称裁剪方法解决细粒度低比特INT训练中的梯度偏差问题。

Result: 发现关键性能交叉点：FP在粗粒度量化中表现优异，但在细粒度（块级）比较中更微妙；8位细粒度格式中MXINT8在算法精度和硬件效率上都优于FP对应格式；4位格式中FP通常有精度优势，但应用Hadamard旋转等异常值缓解技术后NVINT4可以超越NVFP4。

Conclusion: 挑战当前硬件发展轨迹，证明一刀切的FP方法不是最优选择，主张细粒度INT格式（特别是MXINT8）为未来AI加速器提供了精度、功耗和效率的更好平衡。

Abstract: Modern AI hardware, such as Nvidia's Blackwell architecture, is increasingly
embracing low-precision floating-point (FP) formats to handle the pervasive
activation outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite this industry
trend, a unified comparison of FP and integer (INT) quantization across varying
granularities has been missing, leaving algorithm and hardware co-design
without clear guidance. This paper fills that gap by systematically
investigating the trade-offs between FP and INT formats. We reveal a critical
performance crossover: while FP excels in coarse-grained quantization, the
comparison at fine-grained (block-wise) levels is more nuanced. Our
comprehensive comparison demonstrates that for popular 8-bit fine-grained
formats (e.g., MX with block size 32), MXINT8 is superior to its FP counterpart
in both algorithmic accuracy and hardware efficiency. However, for 4-bit
formats, FP (e.g., MXFP4, NVFP4) often holds an accuracy advantage , though we
show that NVINT4 can surpass NVFP4 when outlier-mitigation techniques like
Hadamard rotation are applied. We also introduce a symmetric clipping method
that resolves gradient bias in fine-grained low-bit INT training, enabling
nearly lossless performance for MXINT8 training. These findings challenge the
current hardware trajectory, demonstrating that a one-size-fits-all FP approach
is suboptimal and advocating that fine-grained INT formats, particularly
MXINT8, offer a better balance of accuracy, power, and efficiency for future AI
accelerators.

TL;DR: BOLT-GAN是基于WGAN框架的改进版本，通过引入贝叶斯最优学习阈值(BOLT)原理，使用Lipschitz连续判别器最小化不同于Earth Mover距离的度量距离，显著提升了训练稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WGAN虽然通过Earth Mover距离改进了GAN训练，但仍存在训练稳定性问题。BOLT-GAN旨在通过贝叶斯最优学习阈值原理进一步提升GAN的训练稳定性和生成质量。

Method: 在WGAN框架基础上引入BOLT原理，使用Lipschitz连续判别器，最小化不同于Earth Mover距离的度量距离。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CelebA-64、LSUN Bedroom-64和LSUN Church-64四个标准图像生成基准测试中，BOLT-GAN始终优于WGAN，FID分数降低了10-60%。

Conclusion: BOLT是一个广泛适用的原理，能够有效增强GAN训练，BOLT-GAN在训练稳定性和生成质量方面都取得了显著提升。

Abstract: We introduce BOLT-GAN, a simple yet effective modification of the WGAN
framework inspired by the Bayes Optimal Learning Threshold (BOLT). We show that
with a Lipschitz continuous discriminator, BOLT-GAN implicitly minimizes a
different metric distance than the Earth Mover (Wasserstein) distance and
achieves better training stability. Empirical evaluations on four standard
image generation benchmarks (CIFAR-10, CelebA-64, LSUN Bedroom-64, and LSUN
Church-64) show that BOLT-GAN consistently outperforms WGAN, achieving 10-60%
lower Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Our results suggest that BOLT is a
broadly applicable principle for enhancing GAN training.

Motivation: 研究VLA模型在动作微调过程中，预训练的视觉语言模型(VLMs)的原始视觉语言表示和知识在多大程度上被保留，因为不清楚这些能力是否在适应动作模态时被破坏。

Conclusion: 明确了动作微调与视觉语言表示退化之间的权衡关系，并提出了实用的方法来恢复继承的视觉语言能力。

Abstract: The growing success of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models stems from the
promise that pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can endow agents with
transferable world knowledge and vision-language (VL) grounding, laying a
foundation for action models with broader generalization. Yet when these VLMs
are adapted to the action modality, it remains unclear to what extent their
original VL representations and knowledge are preserved. In this work, we
conduct a systematic study of representation retention during VLA fine-tuning,
showing that naive action fine-tuning leads to degradation of visual
representations. To characterize and measure these effects, we probe VLA's
hidden representations and analyze attention maps, further, we design a set of
targeted tasks and methods that contrast VLA models with their counterpart
VLMs, isolating changes in VL capabilities induced by action fine-tuning. We
further evaluate a range of strategies for aligning visual representations and
introduce a simple yet effective method that mitigates degradation and yields
improved generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Taken together,
our analysis clarifies the trade-off between action fine-tuning and the
degradation of VL representations and highlights practical approaches to
recover inherited VL capabilities. Code is publicly available:

Result: 实验证明FedLap在基准数据集上达到或优于现有技术的性能，是首个具有强隐私保证的子图联邦学习方案

Conclusion: FedLap有效解决了联邦学习中的隐私和可扩展性挑战，在保持隐私的同时实现了竞争性的性能

Abstract: We consider the problem of federated learning (FL) with graph-structured data
distributed across multiple clients. In particular, we address the prevalent
scenario of interconnected subgraphs, where interconnections between clients
significantly influence the learning process. Existing approaches suffer from
critical limitations, either requiring the exchange of sensitive node
embeddings, thereby posing privacy risks, or relying on
computationally-intensive steps, which hinders scalability. To tackle these
challenges, we propose FedLap, a novel framework that leverages global
structure information via Laplacian smoothing in the spectral domain to
effectively capture inter-node dependencies while ensuring privacy and
scalability. We provide a formal analysis of the privacy of FedLap,
demonstrating that it preserves privacy. Notably, FedLap is the first subgraph
FL scheme with strong privacy guarantees. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that FedLap achieves competitive or superior utility
compared to existing techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习中需要理解噪声或测量误差如何影响低秩近似，特别是在谱范数下。现有工作通常分析Frobenius范数误差，但该指标可能高估或低估真实的子空间失真。谱范数能捕捉最坏情况的方向误差并提供最强的效用保证。

Conclusion: 本文的谱范数扰动界限改进了经典结果，解决了差分隐私PCA中的开放问题，并为广泛的谱函数类提供了分析框架。

Abstract: A central challenge in machine learning is to understand how noise or
measurement errors affect low-rank approximations, particularly in the spectral
norm. This question is especially important in differentially private low-rank
approximation, where one aims to preserve the top-$p$ structure of a
data-derived matrix while ensuring privacy. Prior work often analyzes Frobenius
norm error or changes in reconstruction quality, but these metrics can over- or
under-estimate true subspace distortion. The spectral norm, by contrast,
captures worst-case directional error and provides the strongest utility
guarantees. We establish new high-probability spectral-norm perturbation bounds
for symmetric matrices that refine the classical Eckart--Young--Mirsky theorem
and explicitly capture interactions between a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n
\times n}$ and an arbitrary symmetric perturbation $E$. Under mild eigengap and
norm conditions, our bounds yield sharp estimates for $\|(A + E)_p - A_p\|$,
where $A_p$ is the best rank-$p$ approximation of $A$, with improvements of up
to a factor of $\sqrt{n}$. As an application, we derive improved utility
guarantees for differentially private PCA, resolving an open problem in the
literature. Our analysis relies on a novel contour bootstrapping method from
complex analysis and extends it to a broad class of spectral functionals,
including polynomials and matrix exponentials. Empirical results on real-world
datasets confirm that our bounds closely track the actual spectral error under
diverse perturbation regimes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RNN主要处理简单、确定性行为，而自然行为具有自发性和随机性，需要理解RNN如何实现更复杂的离散状态动态。

Method: 训练RNN模拟HMM的发射统计，然后逆向工程分析网络机制，研究在不同HMM架构下的通用性。

Result: 训练后的RNN在无输入时活动收敛到单个固定点，在随机输入下沿闭合轨道进行噪声维持的动态，通过"踢神经元"实现状态转换。

Conclusion: RNN通过模块化重用相同的动态模式来模拟复杂离散潜在动态，这为理解神经计算提供了新的组成性原则。

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) provide a powerful approach in neuroscience
to infer latent dynamics in neural populations and to generate hypotheses about
the neural computations underlying behavior. However, past work has focused on
relatively simple, input-driven, and largely deterministic behaviors - little
is known about the mechanisms that would allow RNNs to generate the richer,
spontaneous, and potentially stochastic behaviors observed in natural settings.
Modeling with Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) has revealed a segmentation of
natural behaviors into discrete latent states with stochastic transitions
between them, a type of dynamics that may appear at odds with the continuous
state spaces implemented by RNNs. Here we first show that RNNs can replicate
HMM emission statistics and then reverse-engineer the trained networks to
uncover the mechanisms they implement. In the absence of inputs, the activity
of trained RNNs collapses towards a single fixed point. When driven by
stochastic input, trajectories instead exhibit noise-sustained dynamics along
closed orbits. Rotation along these orbits modulates the emission probabilities
and is governed by transitions between regions of slow, noise-driven dynamics
connected by fast, deterministic transitions. The trained RNNs develop highly
structured connectivity, with a small set of "kick neurons" initiating
transitions between these regions. This mechanism emerges during training as
the network shifts into a regime of stochastic resonance, enabling it to
perform probabilistic computations. Analyses across multiple HMM architectures
- fully connected, cyclic, and linear-chain - reveal that this solution
generalizes through the modular reuse of the same dynamical motif, suggesting a
compositional principle by which RNNs can emulate complex discrete latent
dynamics.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently been explored as surrogate models
for numerical simulations. While their applications in computational fluid
dynamics have been investigated, little attention has been given to structural
problems, especially for dynamic cases. To address this gap, we introduce the
Graph Network-based Structural Simulator (GNSS), a GNN framework for surrogate
modeling of dynamic structural problems.
  GNSS follows the encode-process-decode paradigm typical of GNN-based machine
learning models, and its design makes it particularly suited for dynamic
simulations thanks to three key features: (i) expressing node kinematics in
node-fixed local frames, which avoids catastrophic cancellation in
finite-difference velocities; (ii) employing a sign-aware regression loss,
which reduces phase errors in long rollouts; and (iii) using a
wavelength-informed connectivity radius, which optimizes graph construction.
  We evaluate GNSS on a case study involving a beam excited by a 50kHz
Hanning-modulated pulse. The results show that GNSS accurately reproduces the
physics of the problem over hundreds of timesteps and generalizes to unseen
loading conditions, where existing GNNs fail to converge or deliver meaningful
predictions.
  Compared with explicit finite element baselines, GNSS achieves substantial
inference speedups while preserving spatial and temporal fidelity. These
findings demonstrate that locality-preserving GNNs with physics-consistent
update rules are a competitive alternative for dynamic, wave-dominated
structural simulations.

*Yesmine Abdennadher,Eleonora Cicciarella,Michele Rossi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出卷积脉冲GRU（CS-GRU）单元，结合卷积操作和脉冲神经元，在时序和时空数据任务中优于现有GRU变体，平均提升4.35%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RNN在处理长序列时会丢失局部细节，现有方法如SpikGRU无法有效捕捉基于事件的时空数据中的细粒度局部依赖关系。

Method: 开发CS-GRU单元，利用卷积操作保持局部结构和依赖关系，同时整合脉冲神经元的时间精度和GRU的高效门控机制。

Result: 在时序数据集（NTIDIGITS、SHD）和时空基准测试（MNIST、DVSGesture、CIFAR10DVS）上表现优异，平均准确率提升4.35%，MNIST达到99.31%，效率比SpikGRU高69%。

Conclusion: CS-GRU是一个多功能架构，在时序和时空数据处理方面优于现有方法，实现了更高的准确率和效率。

Abstract: Spike-based temporal messaging enables SNNs to efficiently process both
purely temporal and spatio-temporal time-series or event-driven data. Combining
SNNs with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), a variant of recurrent neural networks,
gives rise to a robust framework for sequential data processing; however,
traditional RNNs often lose local details when handling long sequences.
Previous approaches, such as SpikGRU, fail to capture fine-grained local
dependencies in event-based spatio-temporal data. In this paper, we introduce
the Convolutional Spiking GRU (CS-GRU) cell, which leverages convolutional
operations to preserve local structure and dependencies while integrating the
temporal precision of spiking neurons with the efficient gating mechanisms of
GRUs. This versatile architecture excels on both temporal datasets (NTIDIGITS,
SHD) and spatio-temporal benchmarks (MNIST, DVSGesture, CIFAR10DVS). Our
experiments show that CS-GRU outperforms state-of-the-art GRU variants by an
average of 4.35%, achieving over 90% accuracy on sequential tasks and up to
99.31% on MNIST. It is worth noting that our solution achieves 69% higher
efficiency compared to SpikGRU. The code is available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种利用李群对称性精确求解初边值问题的方法，通过对称变换将物理定律内嵌于模型中，直接从初始和边界数据学习解，比PINNs更快更准确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法如PINNs在求解PDE约束问题时存在收敛慢和精度不足的问题，需要一种能精确满足PDE且计算高效的方法。

Method: 利用李群对称性构建模型，通过对称变换确保PDE精确满足，直接从初始和边界条件学习解，损失函数直接反映模型精度。

Result: LieSolver在线性齐次PDE上表现出比PINNs更快的收敛速度和更高的精度，同时能进行严格的误差估计。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了PDE约束问题的计算效率和预测可靠性，能生成紧凑模型便于高效优化。

Abstract: We introduce a method for efficiently solving initial-boundary value problems
(IBVPs) that uses Lie symmetries to enforce the associated partial differential
equation (PDE) exactly by construction. By leveraging symmetry transformations,
the model inherently incorporates the physical laws and learns solutions from
initial and boundary data. As a result, the loss directly measures the model's
accuracy, leading to improved convergence. Moreover, for well-posed IBVPs, our
method enables rigorous error estimation. The approach yields compact models,
facilitating an efficient optimization. We implement LieSolver and demonstrate
its application to linear homogeneous PDEs with a range of initial conditions,
showing that it is faster and more accurate than physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs). Overall, our method improves both computational efficiency
and the reliability of predictions for PDE-constrained problems.

*David S Maxwell,Michael Darkoh,Sidharth R Samudrala,Caroline Chung,Stephanie T Schmidt,Bissan Al-Lazikani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MLPrE是一个基于SparkDataFrames的机器学习预处理和探索性数据分析工具，使用JSON配置文件描述数据处理步骤，包含69个处理阶段，支持多种数据格式的规模化处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度学习的发展，需要处理多种格式的源数据，现有工作流存在开销大和可扩展性差的问题，无法与大型处理管道（如Apache Airflow）良好集成，因此需要开发一个强大、可扩展且轻量级的预处理工具。

Method: 利用SparkDataFrames存储处理过程中的数据以确保可扩展性，采用通用的JSON输入文件格式描述对DataFrame的分步更改，实现了输入输出、过滤、基础统计、特征工程和探索性数据分析等处理阶段。

Result: 实现了69个处理阶段，使用六个不同数据集验证了关键阶段的功能，展示了处理平面文件中多个字段并重新组合的能力，以及为图数据库准备数据的能力。

Conclusion: MLPrE提供了一个通用且可扩展的预处理和早期数据分析工具，填补了机器学习应用中对这类工具的关键需求，能够加速和简化大型工作流中的早期开发阶段。

Abstract: With the recent growth of Deep Learning for AI, there is a need for tools to
meet the demand of data flowing into those models. In some cases, source data
may exist in multiple formats, and therefore the source data must be
investigated and properly engineered for a Machine Learning model or graph
database. Overhead and lack of scalability with existing workflows limit
integration within a larger processing pipeline such as Apache Airflow, driving
the need for a robust, extensible, and lightweight tool to preprocess arbitrary
datasets that scales with data type and size. To address this, we present
Machine Learning Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis, MLPrE, in which
SparkDataFrames were utilized to hold data during processing and ensure
scalability. A generalizable JSON input file format was utilized to describe
stepwise changes to that DataFrame. Stages were implemented for input and
output, filtering, basic statistics, feature engineering, and exploratory data
analysis. A total of 69 stages were implemented into MLPrE, of which we
highlight and demonstrate key stages using six diverse datasets. We further
highlight MLPrE's ability to independently process multiple fields in flat
files and recombine them, otherwise requiring an additional pipeline, using a
UniProt glossary term dataset. Building on this advantage, we demonstrated the
clustering stage with available wine quality data. Lastly, we demonstrate the
preparation of data for a graph database in the final stages of MLPrE using
phosphosite kinase data. Overall, our MLPrE tool offers a generalizable and
scalable tool for preprocessing and early data analysis, filling a critical
need for such a tool given the ever expanding use of machine learning. This
tool serves to accelerate and simplify early stage development in larger
workflows.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文通过合成分类任务揭示了传统多示例学习方法忽略实例间上下文关系的局限性，并量化了现有方法与贝叶斯最优估计器的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多示例学习方法在处理医学图像时，将实例（如切片或补丁）独立处理，忽略了相邻实例间的上下文关系，而这些关系在实际应用中至关重要。

Method: 设计了一个合成分类任务，其中相邻实例的特征对准确预测至关重要，并将现有多示例方法与闭式贝叶斯最优估计器进行性能比较。

Result: 实证表明，即使是较新的相关多示例方法，在从数万个实例从头开始训练时，仍难以达到最优泛化性能。

Conclusion: 当前多示例学习方法在利用实例间上下文关系方面存在不足，需要进一步改进以充分利用相邻实例的关联信息。

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) is often used in medical imaging to classify
high-resolution 2D images by processing patches or classify 3D volumes by
processing slices. However, conventional MIL approaches treat instances
separately, ignoring contextual relationships such as the appearance of nearby
patches or slices that can be essential in real applications. We design a
synthetic classification task where accounting for adjacent instance features
is crucial for accurate prediction. We demonstrate the limitations of
off-the-shelf MIL approaches by quantifying their performance compared to the
optimal Bayes estimator for this task, which is available in closed-form. We
empirically show that newer correlated MIL methods still struggle to generalize
as well as possible when trained from scratch on tens of thousands of
instances.

TL;DR: 提出神经随机流（NSFs）及其潜在变体，通过条件归一化流直接学习随机微分方程的转移规律，实现任意时间点的一步采样，相比传统数值方法可加速两个数量级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统随机微分方程建模需要昂贵的数值求解器在任意时间点之间进行采样，计算成本高。

Method: 使用具有架构约束的条件归一化流直接学习随机微分方程的转移规律，保留随机流的特性。

Result: 在合成SDE模拟和真实世界跟踪、视频数据上的实验表明，NSFs在保持与数值方法相当的分布精度的同时，大幅减少了任意时间点采样的计算量。

Conclusion: NSFs提供了一种高效且准确的随机微分方程建模方法，特别适用于金融、物理和机器学习中的噪声和不规则采样时间序列。

Abstract: Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are well suited to modelling noisy
and irregularly sampled time series found in finance, physics, and machine
learning. Traditional approaches require costly numerical solvers to sample
between arbitrary time points. We introduce Neural Stochastic Flows (NSFs) and
their latent variants, which directly learn (latent) SDE transition laws using
conditional normalising flows with architectural constraints that preserve
properties inherited from stochastic flows. This enables one-shot sampling
between arbitrary states and yields up to two orders of magnitude speed-ups at
large time gaps. Experiments on synthetic SDE simulations and on real-world
tracking and video data show that NSFs maintain distributional accuracy
comparable to numerical approaches while dramatically reducing computation for
arbitrary time-point sampling.

*Aofan Liu,Shiyuan Song,Haoxuan Li,Cehao Yang,Yiyan Qi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了RepoAlign-Bench基准和ReflectCode方法，用于解决代码库级别的代码检索问题，在变更请求驱动的场景下显著提升了检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代代码库日益复杂，需要能够理解跨组件变更意图的检索系统，而传统的函数级搜索范式缺乏这种能力。现有的自然语言查询与代码片段对齐研究未能充分解决特定变更请求的上下文相关代码检索问题。

Method: 引入RepoAlign-Bench基准，包含52k标注实例，将检索范式从函数中心匹配转向整体代码库级推理。提出ReflectCode方法，采用对抗性反射增强的双塔架构，包含解耦的代码编码器和文档编码器组件，通过大语言模型引导的反射动态整合语法模式、函数依赖和语义扩展意图。

Result: 综合实验表明，ReflectCode在Top-5准确率上比现有最优基线提升了12.2%，在召回率上提升了7.1%。

Conclusion: 为上下文感知的代码检索建立了新的方向，证明了在变更请求驱动的代码库级检索任务上的有效性。

Abstract: The escalating complexity of modern codebases has intensified the need for
retrieval systems capable of interpreting cross-component change intents, a
capability fundamentally absent in conventional function-level search
paradigms. While recent studies have improved the alignment between natural
language queries and code snippets, retrieving contextually relevant code for
specific change requests remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we
introduce RepoAlign-Bench, the first benchmark specifically designed to
evaluate repository-level code retrieval under change request driven scenarios,
encompassing 52k annotated instances. This benchmark shifts the retrieval
paradigm from function-centric matching to holistic repository-level reasoning.
Furthermore, we propose ReflectCode, an adversarial reflection augmented
dual-tower architecture featuring disentangled code_encoder and doc_encoder
components. ReflectCode dynamically integrates syntactic patterns, function
dependencies, and semantic expansion intents through large language model
guided reflection. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ReflectCode
achieves 12.2% improvement in Top-5 Accuracy and 7.1% in Recall over
state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a new direction for context-aware code
retrieval.

Motivation: 现有AI辅助软件工程工具存在认知过载、工具集成效率低和AI副驾驶能力有限等问题，需要新的编译器范式来降低技术门槛，实现可扩展、适应性强的AI驱动软件开发。

Method: 采用搜索驱动的方法，动态优化认知架构及其组成部分（如提示词、基础模型配置和系统参数），在多目标（准确性、成本、延迟）之间寻找最优权衡。

Result: 提出了Compiler.next的架构设计，将其定位为软件工程3.0时代的基石技术，为完全自动化、搜索驱动的软件开发奠定基础。

Conclusion: Compiler.next通过意图编译和搜索优化，能够促进更快的创新和更高效的AI驱动系统开发，为民主化软件开发提供技术支撑。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-assisted software engineering has brought
transformative potential to the field of software engineering, but existing
tools and paradigms remain limited by cognitive overload, inefficient tool
integration, and the narrow capabilities of AI copilots. In response, we
propose Compiler.next, a novel search-based compiler designed to enable the
seamless evolution of AI-native software systems as part of the emerging
Software Engineering 3.0 era. Unlike traditional static compilers,
Compiler.next takes human-written intents and automatically generates working
software by searching for an optimal solution. This process involves dynamic
optimization of cognitive architectures and their constituents (e.g., prompts,
foundation model configurations, and system parameters) while finding the
optimal trade-off between several objectives, such as accuracy, cost, and
latency. This paper outlines the architecture of Compiler.next and positions it
as a cornerstone in democratizing software development by lowering the
technical barrier for non-experts, enabling scalable, adaptable, and reliable
AI-powered software. We present a roadmap to address the core challenges in
intent compilation, including developing quality programming constructs,
effective search heuristics, reproducibility, and interoperability between
compilers. Our vision lays the groundwork for fully automated, search-driven
software development, fostering faster innovation and more efficient AI-driven
systems.

TL;DR: 提出LLM脚本语言(LSL)的概念，旨在通过领域特定语言来规范和控制大语言模型的输出，提高AI应用的可靠性、鲁棒性和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM应用虽然令人印象深刻，但其不可靠性和幻觉问题阻碍了实际应用，特别是在自动化工作流和管道中。软件工程的正式工具可以为LLM输出提供约束和验证。

Method: 开发一种领域特定语言(DSL)来编写与LLM的交互脚本，通过LSL来控制LLM输出、强制交互结构，并与验证、确认和可解释性集成。

Result: 提出了LSL的愿景框架，使LLM交互可编程化，并与训练或实现解耦。

Conclusion: LSL可能是提高基于AI应用的关键，通过程序化控制LLM输出和集成软件工程工具来解决当前LLM应用的可靠性问题。

Abstract: We are witnessing a bloom of AI-powered software driven by Large Language
Models (LLMs). Although the applications of these LLMs are impressive and
seemingly countless, their unreliability hinders adoption. In fact, the
tendency of LLMs to produce faulty or hallucinated content makes them
unsuitable for automating workflows and pipelines. In this regard, Software
Engineering (SE) provides valuable support, offering a wide range of formal
tools to specify, verify, and validate software behaviour. Such SE tools can be
applied to define constraints over LLM outputs and, consequently, offer
stronger guarantees on the generated content. In this paper, we argue that the
development of a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for scripting interactions with
LLMs using an LLM Scripting Language (LSL) may be key to improve AI-based
applications. Currently, LLMs and LLM-based software still lack reliability,
robustness, and trustworthiness, and the tools or frameworks to cope with these
issues suffer from fragmentation. In this paper, we present our vision of LSL.
With LSL, we aim to address the limitations above by exploring ways to control
LLM outputs, enforce structure in interactions, and integrate these aspects
with verification, validation, and explainability. Our goal is to make LLM
interaction programmable and decoupled from training or implementation.

Method: 使用规划器模块协调生成抽象、类型不变量、规范和证明代码；在提示中嵌入语法指导；包含修复阶段自动纠正注释错误。

Result: 在11个Rust数据结构模块评估中，成功验证了10个模块，总共验证了128/129个函数（99.2%成功率）。

Conclusion: 这是实现自动AI辅助形式验证目标的重要一步，展示了VeriStruct在复杂数据结构验证中的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce VeriStruct, a novel framework that extends AI-assisted automated
verification from single functions to more complex data structure modules in
Verus. VeriStruct employs a planner module to orchestrate the systematic
generation of abstractions, type invariants, specifications, and proof code. To
address the challenge that LLMs often misunderstand Verus' annotation syntax
and verification-specific semantics, VeriStruct embeds syntax guidance within
prompts and includes a repair stage to automatically correct annotation errors.
In an evaluation on eleven Rust data structure modules, VeriStruct succeeds on
ten of the eleven, successfully verifying 128 out of 129 functions (99.2%) in
total. These results represent an important step toward the goal of automatic
AI-assisted formal verification.

Conclusion: HARE-SM模型通过整合AI分析和人工监督，能够有效解决AI在需求工程中的挑战，为未来需求工程的发展提供了重要框架。

Abstract: The future of Requirements Engineering (RE) is increasingly driven by
artificial intelligence (AI), reshaping how we elicit, analyze, and validate
requirements. Traditional RE is based on labor-intensive manual processes prone
to errors and complexity. AI-powered approaches, specifically large language
models (LLMs), natural language processing (NLP), and generative AI, offer
transformative solutions and reduce inefficiencies. However, the use of AI in
RE also brings challenges like algorithmic bias, lack of explainability, and
ethical concerns related to automation. To address these issues, this study
introduces the Human-AI RE Synergy Model (HARE-SM), a conceptual framework that
integrates AI-driven analysis with human oversight to improve requirements
elicitation, analysis, and validation. The model emphasizes ethical AI use
through transparency, explainability, and bias mitigation. We outline a
multi-phase research methodology focused on preparing RE datasets, fine-tuning
AI models, and designing collaborative human-AI workflows. This preliminary
study presents the conceptual framework and early-stage prototype
implementation, establishing a research agenda and practical design direction
for applying intelligent data science techniques to semi-structured and
unstructured RE data in collaborative environments.

TL;DR: BeTaL是一个利用环境设计原则自动化动态基准设计的框架，通过参数化基准模板并使用LLM推理参数空间，以成本效益的方式获得目标属性（如难度和真实性）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM评估主要依赖手工制作的静态基准，这些基准很快饱和，而动态基准虽然能随模型发展而进化，但创建和持续更新成本高昂。

Method: BeTaL框架参数化基准模板的关键设计选择，使用LLM推理参数空间来获得目标属性，验证了其在创建具有期望难度级别基准方面的能力。

Result: 使用BeTaL创建了两个新基准并扩展了流行的代理基准τ-bench，在三个任务和多个目标难度级别上的广泛评估显示，BeTaL产生的基准更接近期望难度，平均偏差范围为5.3%到13.2%，比基线提高了2-4倍。

Conclusion: BeTaL框架能够有效自动化动态基准设计过程，显著提高了基准与目标难度的一致性，为LLM评估提供了更高效和准确的工具。

Abstract: The rapid progress and widespread deployment of LLMs and LLM-powered agents
has outpaced our ability to evaluate them. Hand-crafted, static benchmarks are
the primary tool for assessing model capabilities, but these quickly become
saturated. In contrast, dynamic benchmarks evolve alongside the models they
evaluate, but are expensive to create and continuously update. To address these
challenges, we develop BeTaL (Benchmark Tuning with an LLM-in-the-loop), a
framework that leverages environment design principles to automate the process
of dynamic benchmark design. BeTaL works by parameterizing key design choices
in base benchmark templates and uses LLMs to reason through the resulting
parameter space to obtain target properties (such as difficulty and realism) in
a cost-efficient manner. We validate this approach on its ability to create
benchmarks with desired difficulty levels. Using BeTaL, we create two new
benchmarks and extend a popular agentic benchmark $\tau$-bench. Extensive
evaluation on these three tasks and multiple target difficulty levels shows
that BeTaL produces benchmarks much closer to the desired difficulty, with
average deviations ranging from 5.3% to 13.2% -- a 2-4x improvement over the
baselines.

Abstract: Plagiarism detection in programming education faces growing challenges due to
increasingly sophisticated obfuscation techniques, particularly automated
refactoring-based attacks. While code plagiarism detection systems used in
education practice are resilient against basic obfuscation, they struggle
against structural modifications that preserve program behavior, especially
caused by refactoring-based obfuscation. This paper presents a novel and
extensible framework that enhances state-of-the-art detectors by leveraging
code property graphs and graph transformations to counteract refactoring-based
obfuscation. Our comprehensive evaluation of real-world student submissions,
obfuscated using both algorithmic and AI-based obfuscation attacks,
demonstrates a significant improvement in detecting plagiarized code.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有形式化验证方法需要大量人工努力，而LLM生成的证明经常出错且现有精化方法采用固定策略，无法根据具体问题动态调整，限制了性能。

Method: 提出Adapt框架，使用LLM引导的决策器分析证明助手状态和错误证明上下文，动态选择最合适的精化策略进行迭代改进。

Result: 在两个基准测试中，Adapt比最佳基线方法分别多证明了16.63%和18.58%的定理，并在五个不同LLM上展现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Adapt框架通过动态策略选择显著提升了定理证明的成功率，证明了基于LLM的动态精化策略在形式化验证中的有效性。

Abstract: Formal verification via theorem proving enables the expressive specification
and rigorous proof of software correctness, but it is difficult to scale due to
the significant manual effort and expertise required. While Large Language
Models (LLMs) show potential in proof generation, they frequently produce
incorrect proofs on the first attempt and require additional strategies for
iterative refinement. However, existing approaches employ fixed refinement
strategies and cannot dynamically choose an effective strategy based on the
particular issues in a generated proof, which limits their performance. To
overcome this limitation, we introduce Adapt, a novel proof refinement
framework that leverages an LLM-guided decision-maker to dynamically select a
suitable refinement strategy according to the state of the proof assistant and
available context of an incorrect proof. We evaluate Adapt on two benchmarks
against four existing methods and find that it significantly outperforms the
best baseline on both by proving 16.63% and 18.58% more theorems, respectively.
Furthermore, we demonstrate Adapt's generalizability by evaluating it across
five different LLMs. We also conduct ablation studies to measure the
contribution of each component and compare the trade-offs of alternative
decision-maker designs.

TL;DR: dcFix是一种自动检测和修复REST API误用的方法，通过识别不符合规范的代码片段，结合API规范生成提示，利用大语言模型生成修正代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发者在测试阶段才能发现REST API规范违规，错误信息缺乏有效诊断细节，调试过程需要反复试错。

Method: 识别不符合规范的代码片段，将其与相关API规范整合到提示中，利用大语言模型生成修正代码。

Result: 评估显示dcFix能准确检测API误用，并且在性能上优于基线方法（基线方法在提示中省略了代码片段不符合REST API规范的指示）。

Conclusion: dcFix方法能有效自动修复REST API在客户端程序中的误用问题。

Abstract: Many cloud services provide REST API accessible to client applications.
However, developers often identify specification violations only during
testing, as error messages typically lack the detail necessary for effective
diagnosis. Consequently, debugging requires trial and error. This study
proposes dcFix, a method for detecting and automatically repairing REST API
misuses in client programs. In particular, dcFix identifies non-conforming code
fragments, integrates them with the relevant API specifications into prompts,
and leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce the corrected code. Our
evaluation demonstrates that dcFix accurately detects misuse and outperforms
the baseline approach, in which prompts to the LLM omit any indication of code
fragments non conforming to REST API specifications.

Method: KUMIC框架首先设计检索机制获取代码-注释一致性高的相似演示示例，然后利用思维链引导LLM关注与特定意图对齐的代码语句，构建从代码到意图特定语句再到注释的映射知识链。

Result: 实验结果表明，KUMIC在BLEU、METEOR、ROUGE-L和SBERT指标上分别比最先进基线方法提升了14.49%、22.41%、20.72%和12.94%。

Conclusion: KUMIC通过优化LLM的知识利用方式，有效解决了多意图代码注释生成中意图-代码-注释关系构建的挑战，显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Code comment generation aims to produce a generic overview of a code snippet,
helping developers understand and maintain code. However, generic summaries
alone are insufficient to meet the diverse needs of practitioners; for example,
developers expect the implementation insights to be presented in an untangled
manner, while users seek clear usage instructions. This highlights the
necessity of multi-intent comment generation. With the widespread adoption of
Large Language Models (LLMs) for code-related tasks, these models have been
leveraged to tackle the challenge of multi-intent comment generation. Despite
their successes, state-of-the-art LLM-based approaches often struggle to
construct correct relationships among intents, code, and comments within a
smaller number of demonstration examples. To mitigate this issue, we propose a
framework named KUMIC for multi-intent comment generation. Built upon
in-context learning, KUMIC leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to optimize
knowledge utilization for LLMs to generate intent-specific comments.
Specifically, KUMIC first designs a retrieval mechanism to obtain similar
demonstration examples, which exhibit high code-comment consistency. Then,
KUMIC leverages CoT to guide LLMs to focus on statements facilitating the
derivation of code comments aligned with specific intents. In this context,
KUMIC constructs a mapping knowledge chain, linking code to intent-specific
statements to comments, which enables LLMs to follow similar reasoning steps
when generating the desired comments. We conduct extensive experiments to
evaluate KUMIC, and the results demonstrate that KUMIC outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by 14.49\%, 22.41\%, 20.72\%, and 12.94\% in terms
of BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and SBERT, respectively.

*Nao Yoshimura,Hiroshi Oyama,Takuya Azumi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出了TECS/Rust-OE框架，通过利用调用流和实时OS的独占控制机制来优化性能，解决了TECS/Rust框架中因过度独占控制导致的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着嵌入式系统功能多样化和IoT发展，系统结构变得更大更复杂。为确保系统可靠性（特别是安全性），需要选择合适的编程语言。现有的TECS/Rust框架虽然结合了Rust和基于组件的开发，但过度使用独占控制来确保线程安全导致了性能下降。

Method: 提出TECS/Rust-OE框架，利用调用流和实时OS的独占控制机制来优化性能，同时保持内存安全。基于组件描述自动生成Rust代码，在不影响可重用性的前提下优化性能。

Result: 评估显示，通过优化的独占控制减少了开销，生成的代码具有高可重用性。

Conclusion: TECS/Rust-OE框架成功解决了TECS/Rust的性能问题，在保持内存安全和可重用性的同时显著提升了性能。

Abstract: The diversification of functionalities and the development of the IoT are
making embedded systems larger and more complex in structure. Ensuring system
reliability, especially in terms of security, necessitates selecting an
appropriate programming language. As part of existing research, TECS/Rust has
been proposed as a framework that combines Rust and component-based development
(CBD) to enable scalable system design and enhanced reliability. This framework
represents system structures using static mutable variables, but excessive
exclusive controls applied to ensure thread safety have led to performance
degradation. This paper proposes TECS/Rust-OE, a memory-safe CBD framework
utilizing call flows to address these limitations. The proposed Rust code
leverages real-time OS exclusive control mechanisms, optimizing performance
without compromising reusability. Rust code is automatically generated based on
component descriptions. Evaluations demonstrate reduced overhead due to
optimized exclusion control and high reusability of the generated code.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了TECS/Rust框架，这是一个基于Rust的嵌入式系统组件框架，通过Rust的编译时内存安全特性来解决C语言常见的内存漏洞问题，同时保持组件化开发的灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着嵌入式系统复杂性和规模的增加，组件化开发(CBD)成为解决方案，但C语言存在内存相关问题。需要一种既能保持CBD灵活性又能解决内存安全问题的框架。

Method: 开发了基于Rust的TECS框架，利用Rust的生命周期和借用等编译时内存安全特性，自动化生成CBD组件的Rust代码，并支持与实时操作系统的有效集成。

Result: 生成的代码占实际代码的很大比例，与不使用该框架开发的代码相比，执行时间差异很小，表明框架引入的开销可以忽略不计。

Conclusion: TECS/Rust框架成功地将Rust的内存安全特性与组件化开发的灵活性相结合，为嵌入式系统提供了一种既安全又高效的开发方法。

Abstract: As embedded systems grow in complexity and scale due to increased functional
diversity, component-based development (CBD) emerges as a solution to
streamline their architecture and enhance functionality reuse. CBD typically
utilizes the C programming language for its direct hardware access and
low-level operations, despite its susceptibility to memory-related issues. To
address these concerns, this paper proposes TECS/Rust, a Rust-based framework
specifically designed for TECS, which is a component framework for embedded
systems. It leverages Rust's compile-time memory-safe features, such as
lifetime and borrowing, to mitigate memory vulnerabilities common with C. The
proposed framework not only ensures memory safety but also maintains the
flexibility of CBD, automates Rust code generation for CBD components, and
supports efficient integration with real-time operating systems. An evaluation
of the amount of generated code indicates that the code generated by this paper
framework accounts for a large percentage of the actual code. Compared to code
developed without the proposed framework, the difference in execution time is
minimal, indicating that the overhead introduced by the proposed framework is
negligible.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究比较了基于属性的测试(PBT)和基于示例的测试(EBT)在检测LLM生成代码边缘案例方面的效果，发现两者结合能达到81.25%的缺陷检测率，优于单独使用任一方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在软件开发中生成代码的普及，确保LLM生成代码的质量变得重要。传统基于示例的测试方法经常遗漏边缘案例，需要探索更有效的测试方法。

Method: 分析16个HumanEval问题，使用Claude-4-sonnet生成PBT和EBT测试代码，比较两种方法在检测边缘案例缺陷方面的效果。

Result: 单独使用PBT或EBT的缺陷检测率为68.75%，但两者结合后检测率提升至81.25%。PBT擅长检测性能问题和探索输入空间，EBT擅长检测特定边界条件和特殊模式。

Conclusion: 结合PBT和EBT的混合方法可以显著提高LLM生成代码的可靠性，为基于LLM的代码生成测试策略提供指导。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly generate code in software
development, ensuring the quality of LLM-generated code has become important.
Traditional testing approaches using Example-based Testing (EBT) often miss
edge cases -- defects that occur at boundary values, special input patterns, or
extreme conditions. This research investigates the characteristics of
LLM-generated Property-based Testing (PBT) compared to EBT for exploring edge
cases. We analyze 16 HumanEval problems where standard solutions failed on
extended test cases, generating both PBT and EBT test codes using
Claude-4-sonnet. Our experimental results reveal that while each method
individually achieved a 68.75\% bug detection rate, combining both approaches
improved detection to 81.25\%. The analysis demonstrates complementary
characteristics: PBT effectively detects performance issues and edge cases
through extensive input space exploration, while EBT effectively detects
specific boundary conditions and special patterns. These findings suggest that
a hybrid approach leveraging both testing methods can improve the reliability
of LLM-generated code, providing guidance for test generation strategies in
LLM-based code generation.

TL;DR: Prometheus是一个AI辅助的自动化代码验证系统，通过模块化重构将复杂程序分解为可验证的小组件，然后重新组合证明，显著提高了AI在形式化验证中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 形式化验证对构建可靠软件系统至关重要，但需要专业知识且成本高昂。现代AI系统能识别数学证明模式，但如何有效整合到形式化验证过程仍是挑战。

Method: 采用分解-重组工作流：将复杂程序逻辑（如嵌套循环）分解为可验证的小组件，验证后重新组合构建原始程序证明。当自动化工具不足时，用户可提供轻量级自然语言指导。

Result: 评估显示模块化重构显著提高了AI验证组件的有效性：在精选数据集中成功验证86%的任务（基线为68%）；随着规范复杂性增加，从30%提升到69%；集成复杂程序证明大纲后，从25%提升到87%。

Conclusion: Prometheus通过结合AI能力和模块化软件工程原则，有效降低了形式化验证的门槛，在复杂程序验证方面取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Formal verification is increasingly recognized as a critical foundation for
building reliable software systems. However, the need for specialized expertise
to write precise specifications, navigate complex proof obligations, and learn
annotations often makes verification an order of magnitude more expensive than
implementation. While modern AI systems can recognize patterns in mathematical
proofs and interpret natural language, effectively integrating them into the
formal verification process remains an open challenge. We present Prometheus, a
novel AI-assisted system that facilitates automated code verification with
current AI capabilities in conjunction with modular software engineering
principles (e.g., modular refactoring). Our approach begins by decomposing
complex program logic, such as nested loops, into smaller, verifiable
components. Once verified, these components are recomposed to construct a proof
of the original program. This decomposition-recomposition workflow is
non-trivial. Prometheus addresses this by guiding the proof search through
structured decomposition of complex lemmas into smaller, verifiable sub-lemmas.
When automated tools are insufficient, users can provide lightweight natural
language guidance to steer the proof process effectively. Our evaluation
demonstrates that transiently applying modular restructuring to the code
substantially improves the AI's effectiveness in verifying individual
components. This approach successfully verifies 86% of tasks in our curated
dataset, compared to 68% for the baseline. Gains are more pronounced with
increasing specification complexity, improving from 30% to 69%, and when
integrating proof outlines for complex programs, from 25% to 87%.

TL;DR: 通过分析Stack Overflow上AI代理开发者的讨论，识别出7大领域77个技术挑战，包括运行时集成、依赖管理、编排复杂性和评估可靠性等问题，并量化了问题的流行度和难度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI代理系统虽然前景广阔，但开发者在构建、部署和维护过程中面临持续且未被充分探索的挑战，需要系统性地识别这些问题。

Method: 通过标签扩展和过滤构建开发者挑战分类法，应用LDA-MALLET进行主题建模，并手动验证和标记结果主题，分析2021-2025年的演变趋势。

Result: 识别出7大领域77个技术挑战，量化了主题流行度和难度，绘制了代理开发中使用的工具和编程语言地图，并追踪了与主要AI模型和框架发布相关的发展演变。

Conclusion: 研究结果为从业者、研究人员和教育工作者提供了关于代理可靠性和开发者支持的具体指导，有助于改进AI代理系统的开发实践。

Abstract: AI agents have rapidly gained popularity across research and industry as
systems that extend large language models with additional capabilities to plan,
use tools, remember, and act toward specific goals. Yet despite their promise,
developers face persistent and often underexplored challenges when building,
deploying, and maintaining these emerging systems. To identify these
challenges, we study developer discussions on Stack Overflow, the world's
largest developer-focused Q and A platform with about 60 million questions and
answers and 30 million users. We construct a taxonomy of developer challenges
through tag expansion and filtering, apply LDA-MALLET for topic modeling, and
manually validate and label the resulting themes. Our analysis reveals seven
major areas of recurring issues encompassing 77 distinct technical challenges
related to runtime integration, dependency management, orchestration
complexity, and evaluation reliability. We further quantify topic popularity
and difficulty to identify which issues are most common and hardest to resolve,
map the tools and programming languages used in agent development, and track
their evolution from 2021 to 2025 in relation to major AI model and framework
releases. Finally, we present the implications of our results, offering
concrete guidance for practitioners, researchers, and educators on agent
reliability and developer support.

TL;DR: 对ICSE 2024和ASE 2024会议上86篇LLM相关研究进行分析，发现仅有18篇提供了研究构件并使用OpenAI模型。在这18篇中，只有5篇适合复现，但没有一篇能完全复现结果，2篇部分可复现，3篇不可复现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在学术界和工业界日益受到关注，进行LLM实证研究仍然具有挑战性，需要了解当前研究成果的可复现性程度以及阻碍复现性的因素。

Method: 分析了ICSE 2024和ASE 2024会议上86篇LLM相关研究，重点对其中18篇提供了研究构件并使用OpenAI模型的研究进行了复现尝试。

Result: 在18篇研究中，只有5篇适合复现，但没有一篇能完全复现结果，2篇部分可复现，3篇不可复现。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了需要更严格的研究构件评估和更稳健的研究设计，以确保未来出版物的可复现价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models have gained remarkable interest in industry and
academia. The increasing interest in LLMs in academia is also reflected in the
number of publications on this topic over the last years. For instance, alone
78 of the around 425 publications at ICSE 2024 performed experiments with LLMs.
Conducting empirical studies with LLMs remains challenging and raises questions
on how to achieve reproducible results, for both other researchers and
practitioners. One important step towards excelling in empirical research on
LLMs and their application is to first understand to what extent current
research results are eventually reproducible and what factors may impede
reproducibility. This investigation is within the scope of our work. We
contribute an analysis of the reproducibility of LLM-centric studies, provide
insights into the factors impeding reproducibility, and discuss suggestions on
how to improve the current state. In particular, we studied the 86 articles
describing LLM-centric studies, published at ICSE 2024 and ASE 2024. Of the 86
articles, 18 provided research artefacts and used OpenAI models. We attempted
to replicate those 18 studies. Of the 18 studies, only five were fit for
reproduction. For none of the five studies, we were able to fully reproduce the
results. Two studies seemed to be partially reproducible, and three studies did
not seem to be reproducible. Our results highlight not only the need for
stricter research artefact evaluations but also for more robust study designs
to ensure the reproducible value of future publications.

TL;DR: GreenAFL是一个能量感知的模糊测试框架，通过将功耗纳入模糊测试启发式算法来减少自动化测试的环境影响，同时保持代码覆盖率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有灰盒模糊测试方法如AFL++主要关注覆盖率最大化，而没有考虑探索不同执行路径的能量成本。持续的模糊测试活动消耗大量计算资源并产生显著的碳足迹。

Method: GreenAFL引入了两个关键修改：1）能量感知的语料库最小化，在减少初始语料库时考虑功耗；2）能量引导的启发式算法，将变异导向高覆盖率、低能量的输入。

Result: 消融研究表明，当使用至少一个修改时，可以实现最高的覆盖率和最低的能量使用。

Conclusion: GreenAFL通过将能量消耗纳入模糊测试决策过程，在保持测试效果的同时显著降低了环境影响。

Abstract: Fuzzing has become a key search-based technique for software testing, but
continuous fuzzing campaigns consume substantial computational resources and
generate significant carbon footprints. Existing grey-box fuzzing approaches
like AFL++ focus primarily on coverage maximisation, without considering the
energy costs of exploring different execution paths. This paper presents
GreenAFL, an energy-aware framework that incorporates power consumption into
the fuzzing heuristics to reduce the environmental impact of automated testing
whilst maintaining coverage. GreenAFL introduces two key modifications to
traditional fuzzing workflows: energy-aware corpus minimisation considering
power consumption when reducing initial corpora, and energy-guided heuristics
that direct mutation towards high-coverage, low-energy inputs. We conduct an
ablation study comparing vanilla AFL++, energy-based corpus minimisation, and
energy-based heuristics to evaluate the individual contributions of each
component. Results show that highest coverage, and lowest energy usage is
achieved whenever at least one of our modifications is used.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了LOCALIZE框架，一个用于无线电定位的低代码、配置优先的机器学习实验框架，旨在实现可重复性、易用性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器学习在无线电定位中面临的三重差距：低编码工作量、默认可重复性和内置可扩展性。现有工具很少同时满足这三个需求。

Method: 采用声明式配置方法，通过工作流编排器运行标准化流水线，从数据准备到报告生成，所有工件（数据集、模型、指标、报告）都进行版本控制。

Result: 与普通Jupyter笔记本基线相比，该框架减少了编写工作量，同时保持了相当的运行时间和内存行为。使用蓝牙低功耗数据集的实验表明，随着数据量的增长（1倍到10倍），编排开销保持有界。

Conclusion: LOCALIZE框架使基于机器学习的定位实验变得实用、易访问和可扩展，实现了可重复的实验规范。

Abstract: Machine learning is increasingly permeating radio-based localization
services. To keep results credible and comparable, everyday workflows should
make rigorous experiment specification and exact repeatability the default,
without blocking advanced experimentation. However, in practice, researchers
face a three-way gap that could be filled by a framework that offers (i) low
coding effort for end-to-end studies, (ii) reproducibility by default including
versioned code, data, and configurations, controlled randomness, isolated runs,
and recorded artifacts, and (iii) built-in extensibility so new models,
metrics, and stages can be added with minimal integration effort. Existing
tools rarely deliver all three for machine learning in general and localization
workflows in particular. In this paper we introduce LOCALIZE, a low-code,
configuration-first framework for radio localization in which experiments are
declared in human-readable configuration, a workflow orchestrator runs
standardized pipelines from data preparation to reporting, and all artifacts,
such as datasets, models, metrics, and reports, are versioned. The
preconfigured, versioned datasets reduce initial setup and boilerplate,
speeding up model development and evaluation. The design, with clear extension
points, allows experts to add components without reworking the infrastructure.
In a qualitative comparison and a head-to-head study against a plain Jupyter
notebook baseline, we show that the framework reduces authoring effort while
maintaining comparable runtime and memory behavior. Furthermore, using a
Bluetooth Low Energy dataset, we show that scaling across training data (1x to
10x) keeps orchestration overheads bounded as data grows. Overall, the
framework makes reproducible machine-learning-based localization
experimentation practical, accessible, and extensible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试仅评估端到端的构建/测试成功，无法揭示代理成功或失败的具体原因和位置，环境配置仍然是基于LLM的软件工程代理的瓶颈。

Method: 通过注入真实的README错误自动构建任务实例，在Docker中进行验证，结合过程级分析和端到端可执行性来评估代理能力。

Result: 评估显示代理能够定位错误，但难以将反馈转化为有效修正，限制了端到端性能。

Conclusion: Enconda-bench是首个为环境配置提供过程级内部能力评估的框架，为改进软件工程代理提供了可操作的见解。

Abstract: Large language model-based agents show promise for software engineering, but
environment configuration remains a bottleneck due to heavy manual effort and
scarce large-scale, high-quality datasets. Existing benchmarks assess only
end-to-end build/test success, obscuring where and why agents succeed or fail.
We introduce the Environment Configuration Diagnosis Benchmark, Enconda-bench,
which provides process-level trajectory assessment of fine-grained agent
capabilities during environment setup-planning, perception-driven error
diagnosis, feedback-driven repair, and action to execute final environment
configuration. Our task instances are automatically constructed by injecting
realistic README errors and are validated in Docker for scalable, high-quality
evaluation. Enconda-bench combines process-level analysis with end-to-end
executability to enable capability assessments beyond aggregate success rates.
Evaluations across state-of-the-art LLMs and agent frameworks show that while
agents can localize errors, they struggle to translate feedback into effective
corrections, limiting end-to-end performance. To our knowledge, Enconda-bench
is the first framework to provide process-level internal capability assessment
for environment configuration, offering actionable insights for improving
software engineering agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RLVR数据调度方法通常依赖基于路径的指标来排序查询，忽略了这些查询的推理树结构。

Method: 引入推理分数(r-score)来衡量查询的学习难度，基于推理树结构；提出推理树调度(Re-Schedule)算法，构建从结构简单到复杂查询的课程。

Result: 在六个数学推理基准测试中，Re-Schedule显著提高了平均准确率，最高提升3.2%。

Conclusion: 对推理树的结构理解为RLVR数据调度提供了更强大和原则性的基础。

Abstract: Using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize Large
Language Models (LLMs) can be conceptualized as progressively editing a query's
`Reasoning Tree'. This process involves exploring nodes (tokens) and
dynamically modifying the model's policy at each node. When combined with data
scheduling, this process yields further gains in data efficiency and accuracy.
However, existing RLVR data scheduling methods typically rely on path-based
metrics to rank queries, overlooking the reasoning tree structures of these
queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric, namely Reasoning Score
(r-score), which measures the query's learning difficulty based on the
structure of its reasoning tree. Based on the r-score, we propose the Reasoning
Tree Schedule (Re-Schedule), a scheduling algorithm that constructs a
curriculum progressing from structurally simple (high r-score) to complex (low
r-score) queries. Experiments on six math-reasoning benchmarks show that
Re-Schedule significantly improves average accuracy, achieving gains of up to
3.2%. These strong results validate our approach and demonstrate that a
structural understanding of the reasoning tree provides a more powerful and
principled foundation for RLVR data scheduling.

TL;DR: ALDEN是一个多轮强化学习框架，通过将视觉语言模型训练为交互式代理，使其能够主动导航长文档。它引入了fetch动作直接访问页面，提出了基于规则的跨层次奖励机制和视觉语义锚定机制来解决训练稳定性问题，在五个长文档基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在处理需要跨多页分析和整合信息的复杂长文档时表现不佳，通常依赖固定的推理模板或刚性流程，限制了模型的效率和泛化能力。

Method: ALDEN采用多轮强化学习框架，引入fetch动作直接按索引访问页面，提出基于规则的跨层次奖励机制进行密集过程监督，并使用视觉语义锚定机制通过双路径KL散度约束来稳定训练过程中的视觉和文本表示。

Result: 在三个开源数据集构建的语料库上训练后，ALDEN在五个长文档基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ALDEN标志着从被动文档阅读向能够自主导航和推理长视觉丰富文档的代理迈出了一步，为更准确和高效的长文档理解提供了稳健路径。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at interpreting text-rich images but
struggle with long, visually complex documents that demand analysis and
integration of information spread across multiple pages. Existing approaches
typically rely on fixed reasoning templates or rigid pipelines, which force
VLMs into a passive role and hinder both efficiency and generalization. We
present Active Long-DocumEnt Navigation (ALDEN), a multi-turn reinforcement
learning framework that fine-tunes VLMs as interactive agents capable of
actively navigating long, visually rich documents. ALDEN introduces a novel
fetch action that directly accesses the page by index, complementing the
classic search action and better exploiting document structure. For dense
process supervision and efficient training, we propose a rule-based cross-level
reward that provides both turn- and token-level signals. To address the
empirically observed training instability caused by numerous visual tokens from
long documents, we further propose a visual-semantic anchoring mechanism that
applies a dual-path KL-divergence constraint to stabilize visual and textual
representations separately during training. Trained on a corpus constructed
from three open-source datasets, ALDEN achieves state-of-the-art performance on
five long-document benchmarks. Overall, ALDEN marks a step beyond passive
document reading toward agents that autonomously navigate and reason across
long, visually rich documents, offering a robust path to more accurate and
efficient long-document understanding.

Motivation: 传统反事实推理框架假设无环结构因果模型，但现实系统（如生物系统）包含反馈循环或循环依赖，违反无环性假设

Method: 研究循环SCMs中的反事实推理，特别关注移位-尺度干预，即对变量机制进行重新缩放和/或移位的软性、政策式变化

Abstract: Most counterfactual inference frameworks traditionally assume acyclic
structural causal models (SCMs), i.e. directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). However,
many real-world systems (e.g. biological systems) contain feedback loops or
cyclic dependencies that violate acyclicity. In this work, we study
counterfactual inference in cyclic SCMs under shift-scale interventions, i.e.,
soft, policy-style changes that rescale and/or shift a variable's mechanism.

Motivation: E/M编码主要用于医疗账单，对医生来说是辅助性但重要的任务。自动化此编码可以减轻医生文档负担、提高账单效率，从而改善患者护理。

Method: 开发了基于LLM的ProFees框架，专门解决E/M编码中的现实复杂性，通过系统化方法处理编码挑战。

Abstract: Evaluation and Management (E/M) coding, under the Current Procedural
Terminology (CPT) taxonomy, documents medical services provided to patients by
physicians. Used primarily for billing purposes, it is in physicians' best
interest to provide accurate CPT E/M codes. %While important, it is an
auxiliary task that adds to physicians' documentation burden. Automating this
coding task will help alleviate physicians' documentation burden, improve
billing efficiency, and ultimately enable better patient care. However, a
number of real-world complexities have made E/M encoding automation a
challenging task. In this paper, we elaborate some of the key complexities and
present ProFees, our LLM-based framework that tackles them, followed by a
systematic evaluation. On an expert-curated real-world dataset, ProFees
achieves an increase in coding accuracy of more than 36\% over a commercial CPT
E/M coding system and almost 5\% over our strongest single-prompt baseline,
demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the real-world complexities.

*Minkyung Kim,Junsik Kim,Woongcheol Yang,Sangdon Park,Sohee Bae*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Autoregressive State-Tracking Prompting (ASTP)方法，通过显式状态跟踪和占位符后处理，解决LLM在游戏交易系统中无法遵循流程规则的问题，实现了99%以上的状态合规性和99.3%的计算精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在动态游戏交互中具有灵活性，但无法遵循规则治理的交易系统的基本流程（浏览-报价-审查-确认），这会削弱玩家信任。需要解决LLM的创造性灵活性与游戏交易程序性需求之间的核心矛盾。

Method: 引入Autoregressive State-Tracking Prompting (ASTP)方法，通过精心设计的提示词强制LLM使其状态跟踪过程显式化和可验证。该方法让LLM识别并报告前一轮的预定义状态标签，并结合状态特定的占位符后处理方法确保交易完整性。

Result: 在300个交易对话评估中，实现了>99%的状态合规性和99.3%的计算精度。使用较小模型（Gemini-2.5-Flash）配合ASTP和占位符后处理，性能与较大模型（Gemini-2.5-Pro）相当，同时响应时间从21.2秒减少到2.4秒。

Conclusion: ASTP方法为商业游戏建立了实用基础，既满足实时性要求，又符合资源限制，同时保持了交易系统的程序完整性和玩家信任。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable dynamic game interactions but fail to
follow essential procedural flows in rule-governed trading systems, eroding
player trust. This work resolves the core tension between the creative
flexibility of LLMs and the procedural demands of in-game trading
(browse-offer-review-confirm). To this end, Autoregressive State-Tracking
Prompting (ASTP) is introduced, a methodology centered on a strategically
orchestrated prompt that compels an LLM to make its state-tracking process
explicit and verifiable. Instead of relying on implicit contextual
understanding, ASTP tasks the LLM with identifying and reporting a predefined
state label from the previous turn. To ensure transactional integrity, this is
complemented by a state-specific placeholder post-processing method for
accurate price calculations. Evaluation across 300 trading dialogues
demonstrates >99% state compliance and 99.3% calculation precision. Notably,
ASTP with placeholder post-processing on smaller models (Gemini-2.5-Flash)
matches larger models' (Gemini-2.5-Pro) performance while reducing response
time from 21.2s to 2.4s, establishing a practical foundation that satisfies
both real-time requirements and resource constraints of commercial games.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出PM4GRPO方法，通过过程挖掘技术增强推理感知的组相对策略优化，在标准答案/格式奖励基础上增加推理过程信号，显著提升大推理模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于强化学习的后训练方法主要关注结果导向的奖励机制，缺乏对推理过程的监督，限制了多步推理能力的提升。

Method: 使用过程挖掘技术计算一致性奖励，衡量策略模型的推理过程与预训练教师模型的匹配程度，结合标准答案/格式奖励构建推理感知的GRPO框架。

Result: 在五个基准测试上的实证结果表明，PM4GRPO显著优于现有的GRPO后训练方法。

Conclusion: 利用过程挖掘进行推理感知的GRPO能有效增强策略模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training has been crucial for enabling
multi-step reasoning in large reasoning models (LRMs), yet current reward
schemes are typically outcome-centric. We propose PM4GRPO, a reasoning-aware
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that augments standard answer/format
rewards with signals over the reasoning procedure. To this end, process mining
techniques are utilized to compute a scalar conformance reward that measures
how closely a policy model's reasoning aligns with the pretrained teacher
model. The empirical results on five benchmarks demonstrate that PM4GRPO
significantly outperforms existing methodologies for GRPO-based post-training.
These results highlight that leveraging process mining for reasoning-aware GRPO
effectively enhances the reasoning capabilities of policy models.

Abstract: Stock movement prediction remains fundamentally challenging due to complex
temporal dependencies, heterogeneous modalities, and dynamically evolving
inter-stock relationships. Existing approaches often fail to unify structural,
semantic, and regime-adaptive modeling within a scalable framework. This work
introduces H3M-SSMoEs, a novel Hypergraph-based MultiModal architecture with
LLM reasoning and Style-Structured Mixture of Experts, integrating three key
innovations: (1) a Multi-Context Multimodal Hypergraph that hierarchically
captures fine-grained spatiotemporal dynamics via a Local Context Hypergraph
(LCH) and persistent inter-stock dependencies through a Global Context
Hypergraph (GCH), employing shared cross-modal hyperedges and Jensen-Shannon
Divergence weighting mechanism for adaptive relational learning and cross-modal
alignment; (2) a LLM-enhanced reasoning module, which leverages a frozen large
language model with lightweight adapters to semantically fuse and align
quantitative and textual modalities, enriching representations with
domain-specific financial knowledge; and (3) a Style-Structured Mixture of
Experts (SSMoEs) that combines shared market experts and industry-specialized
experts, each parameterized by learnable style vectors enabling regime-aware
specialization under sparse activation. Extensive experiments on three major
stock markets demonstrate that H3M-SSMoEs surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
both superior predictive accuracy and investment performance, while exhibiting
effective risk control. Datasets, source code, and model weights are available

TL;DR: KnowCoder-A1是一个基于多阶段课程强化学习的KBQA方法，通过结果监督训练LLM在知识库上自主进行代理推理，显著提升了问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KBQA方法通常通过过程监督微调LLM，但这种方法对探索的激励较弱，无法有效增强代理推理能力。

Method: 采用多阶段课程强化学习，首先在高质量轨迹上微调LLM建立基础能力，然后通过从易到难的奖励调度应用课程RL来缓解结果监督中的奖励稀疏问题。

Result: 在三个主流数据集上持续优于先前方法，在GrailQA的零样本子集上实现了11.1%的相对提升，且仅使用十二分之一的训练数据。

Conclusion: 基于结果监督的KnowCoder-A1展现出强大的推理行为，证明了其在知识库问答中自主代理推理的有效性。

Abstract: Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural-language
questions over a structured Knowledge Base (KB). Recent work improves KBQA by
adopting an agentic reasoning paradigm, in which Large Language Models (LLMs)
iteratively decompose a question, generate its corresponding logical queries,
and interact with the KB to derive the answer. However, these methods typically
fine-tune LLMs on reasoning trajectories synthesized via process supervision,
which offers weak incentives for exploration and thus fails to strengthen the
agentic reasoning ability. In this paper, we propose KnowCoder-A1, an LLM that
can autonomously perform agentic reasoning on KBs to obtain answers. To
incentivize autonomous exploration, KnowCoder-A1 trains the LLM under
outcome-only supervision via a multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning
with an easy-to-hard curriculum. To establish foundational agentic
capabilities, KnowCoder-A1 first fine-tunes the LLM on a small set of
high-quality trajectories obtained through outcome-based rejection sampling.
Then, to alleviate the reward sparsity inherent in outcome-only supervision, it
applies multi-stage curriculum RL with reward schedules that progress from easy
to hard. Trained with outcome-only supervision, KnowCoder-A1 exhibits powerful
reasoning behaviors and consistently outperforms prior approaches across three
mainstream datasets. Notably, on the zero-shot subset of GrailQA, KnowCoder-A1
achieves up to an 11.1% relative improvement while using only one-twelfth of
the training data, demonstrating strong agentic reasoning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐方法通常作为静态层应用于输入或输出，仅提供二元分类（安全或不安全），缺乏上下文感知和可解释性。

Method: 引入动态协作智能体框架，包括Shield、Responder、Evaluator和Reflector，实现上下文感知和可解释的审核。

Result: 在5个数据集和4个大型视觉语言模型上的实验表明，攻击成功率降低7-19%，拒绝率提高4-20%，保持稳定的不遵循率。

Conclusion: Agentic Moderation通过利用智能体架构的灵活性和推理能力，提供了模块化、可扩展和细粒度的安全执行，展示了智能体系统作为自动化安全治理基础的潜力。

Abstract: Agentic methods have emerged as a powerful and autonomous paradigm that
enhances reasoning, collaboration, and adaptive control, enabling systems to
coordinate and independently solve complex tasks. We extend this paradigm to
safety alignment by introducing Agentic Moderation, a model-agnostic framework
that leverages specialised agents to defend multimodal systems against
jailbreak attacks. Unlike prior approaches that apply as a static layer over
inputs or outputs and provide only binary classifications (safe or unsafe), our
method integrates dynamic, cooperative agents, including Shield, Responder,
Evaluator, and Reflector, to achieve context-aware and interpretable
moderation. Extensive experiments across five datasets and four representative
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate that our approach reduces the
Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 7-19%, maintains a stable Non-Following Rate (NF),
and improves the Refusal Rate (RR) by 4-20%, achieving robust, interpretable,
and well-balanced safety performance. By harnessing the flexibility and
reasoning capacity of agentic architectures, Agentic Moderation provides
modular, scalable, and fine-grained safety enforcement, highlighting the
broader potential of agentic systems as a foundation for automated safety
governance.

Conclusion: EneAD框架有效解决了自动驾驶能耗问题，在保持感知精度的同时显著降低计算消耗，提升了电动汽车的实用性和续航能力。

Abstract: Autonomous driving is an emerging technology that is expected to bring
significant social, economic, and environmental benefits. However, these
benefits come with rising energy consumption by computation engines, limiting
the driving range of vehicles, especially electric ones. Perception computing
is typically the most power-intensive component, as it relies on largescale
deep learning models to extract environmental features. Recently, numerous
studies have employed model compression techniques, such as sparsification,
quantization, and distillation, to reduce computational consumption. However,
these methods often result in either a substantial model size or a significant
drop in perception accuracy compared to high-computation models. To address
these challenges, we propose an energy-efficient autonomous driving framework,
called EneAD. In the adaptive perception module, a perception optimization
strategy is designed from the perspective of data management and tuning.
Firstly, we manage multiple perception models with different computational
consumption and adjust the execution framerate dynamically. Then, we define
them as knobs and design a transferable tuning method based on Bayesian
optimization to identify promising knob values that achieve low computation
while maintaining desired accuracy. To adaptively switch the knob values in
various traffic scenarios, a lightweight classification model is proposed to
distinguish the perception difficulty in different scenarios. In the robust
decision module, we propose a decision model based on reinforcement learning
and design a regularization term to enhance driving stability in the face of
perturbed perception results. Extensive experiments evidence the superiority of
our framework in both energy consumption and driving performance. EneAD can
reduce perception consumption by 1.9x to 3.5x and thus improve driving range by
3.9% to 8.5%

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出RAVR框架，利用答案引导的推理作为变分替代，解决LLM在超出当前能力任务中难以生成高质量推理路径的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当LLM面对超出其当前能力的任务时，难以生成高质量的推理路径，而强化学习会强化熟悉但次优的推理。受认知科学启发，"为什么是这个答案"比"答案是什么"更容易回答，因为避免了开放式探索的认知负担。

Method: 引入RAVR（参考答案引导的变分推理）框架，使用答案条件推理作为仅问题推理的变分替代，通过答案来推导高质量推理路径。

Result: 在通用和数学领域的实验中，RAVR相比强基线模型取得了持续改进，减少了犹豫，加强了结论整合，并促进了问题特定的推理策略。

Conclusion: 条件化答案可证明地提高了采样推理路径的期望效用，将难以处理的问题转化为可学习的问题，RAVR框架有效提升了LLM的推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can refine the reasoning abilities of large
language models (LLMs), but critically depends on a key prerequisite: the LLM
can already generate high-utility reasoning paths with non-negligible
probability. For tasks beyond the LLM's current competence, such reasoning path
can be hard to sample, and learning risks reinforcing familiar but suboptimal
reasoning. We are motivated by the insight from cognitive science that Why is
this the answer is often an easier question than What is the answer, as it
avoids the heavy cognitive load of open-ended exploration, opting instead for
explanatory reconstruction-systematically retracing the reasoning that links a
question to its answer. We show that LLMs can similarly leverage answers to
derive high-quality reasoning paths. We formalize this phenomenon and prove
that conditioning on answer provably increases the expected utility of sampled
reasoning paths, thereby transforming intractable problems into learnable ones.
Building on this insight, we introduce RAVR (Reference-Answer-guided
Variational Reasoning), an end-to-end framework that uses answer-conditioned
reasoning as a variational surrogate for question-only reasoning. Experiments
in both general and math domains demonstrate consistent improvements over
strong baselines. We further analyze the reasoning behavior and find that RAVR
reduces hesitation, strengthens conclusion consolidation, and promotes
problem-specific strategies in reasoning.

Method: 采用多代理系统架构，包括创意代理、代码代理、批评代理和评估代理。结合强化学习和遗传算法原理实现代理进化，平衡探索与利用。使用分层知识库和双记忆系统实现持续改进。

Result: 在真实工业数据集上的实验表明，FELA能够生成可解释、领域相关的特征，显著提升模型性能，同时减少人工工作量。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的多代理系统为复杂现实环境中的自动化、可解释和自适应特征工程提供了一个通用框架。

Abstract: Event log data, recording fine-grained user actions and system events,
represent one of the most valuable assets for modern digital services. However,
the complexity and heterogeneity of industrial event logs--characterized by
large scale, high dimensionality, diverse data types, and intricate temporal or
relational structures--make feature engineering extremely challenging. Existing
automatic feature engineering approaches, such as AutoML or genetic methods,
often suffer from limited explainability, rigid predefined operations, and poor
adaptability to complicated heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose FELA
(Feature Engineering LLM Agents), a multi-agent evolutionary system that
autonomously extracts meaningful and high-performing features from complex
industrial event log data. FELA integrates the reasoning and coding
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with an insight-guided
self-evolution paradigm. Specifically, FELA employs specialized agents--Idea
Agents, Code Agents, and Critic Agents--to collaboratively generate, validate,
and implement novel feature ideas. An Evaluation Agent summarizes feedback and
updates a hierarchical knowledge base and dual-memory system to enable
continual improvement. Moreover, FELA introduces an agentic evolution
algorithm, combining reinforcement learning and genetic algorithm principles to
balance exploration and exploitation across the idea space. Extensive
experiments on real industrial datasets demonstrate that FELA can generate
explainable, domain-relevant features that significantly improve model
performance while reducing manual effort. Our results highlight the potential
of LLM-based multi-agent systems as a general framework for automated,
interpretable, and adaptive feature engineering in complex real-world
environments.

Abstract: Psychiatric comorbidity is clinically significant yet challenging due to the
complexity of multiple co-occurring disorders. To address this, we develop a
novel approach integrating synthetic patient electronic medical record (EMR)
construction and multi-agent diagnostic dialogue generation. We create 502
synthetic EMRs for common comorbid conditions using a pipeline that ensures
clinical relevance and diversity. Our multi-agent framework transfers the
clinical interview protocol into a hierarchical state machine and context tree,
supporting over 130 diagnostic states while maintaining clinical standards.
Through this rigorous process, we construct PsyCoTalk, the first large-scale
dialogue dataset supporting comorbidity, containing 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic
dialogues validated by psychiatrists. This dataset enhances diagnostic accuracy
and treatment planning, offering a valuable resource for psychiatric
comorbidity research. Compared to real-world clinical transcripts, PsyCoTalk
exhibits high structural and linguistic fidelity in terms of dialogue length,
token distribution, and diagnostic reasoning strategies. Licensed psychiatrists
confirm the realism and diagnostic validity of the dialogues. This dataset
enables the development and evaluation of models capable of multi-disorder
psychiatric screening in a single conversational pass.

TL;DR: GAP框架通过图基规划建模任务依赖关系，实现自适应并行和串行工具执行，显著提升多步推理任务的执行效率和准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的自主代理（如ReAct）采用顺序推理执行，无法利用独立子任务的并行性，导致工具利用效率低下和多步推理性能不佳

Method: 训练代理基础模型将复杂任务分解为依赖感知的子任务图，自主确定可并行执行和必须顺序执行的工具；采用两阶段训练策略：在高质量图基规划数据集上进行监督微调，然后在策略性采样查询上使用基于正确性的奖励函数进行强化学习

Result: 在MHQA数据集上的实验结果表明，GAP显著优于传统ReAct基线，特别是在多步检索任务上，同时通过智能并行化实现了工具调用效率的显著提升

Conclusion: 图基代理规划框架通过依赖感知的任务编排，在保持任务准确性的同时大幅提高了执行效率，为复杂任务解决提供了更高效的范式

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown
impressive capabilities in tool manipulation for complex task-solving. However,
existing paradigms such as ReAct rely on sequential reasoning and execution,
failing to exploit the inherent parallelism among independent sub-tasks. This
sequential bottleneck leads to inefficient tool utilization and suboptimal
performance in multi-step reasoning scenarios. We introduce Graph-based Agent
Planning (GAP), a novel framework that explicitly models inter-task
dependencies through graph-based planning to enable adaptive parallel and
serial tool execution. Our approach trains agent foundation models to decompose
complex tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, autonomously determining
which tools can be executed in parallel and which must follow sequential
dependencies. This dependency-aware orchestration achieves substantial
improvements in both execution efficiency and task accuracy. To train GAP, we
construct a high-quality dataset of graph-based planning traces derived from
the Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) benchmark. We employ a two-stage
training strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the curated dataset,
followed by reinforcement learning (RL) with a correctness-based reward
function on strategically sampled queries where tool-based reasoning provides
maximum value. Experimental results on MHQA datasets demonstrate that GAP
significantly outperforms traditional ReAct baselines, particularly on
multi-step retrieval tasks, while achieving dramatic improvements in tool
invocation efficiency through intelligent parallelization. The project page is

TL;DR: 提出KVDA-UCT算法，通过分析即时奖励推断价值差异，在MCTS中检测更多抽象，提高样本效率，在多种确定性环境中优于OGA-UCT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OGA-UCT算法要求状态-动作对具有相同即时奖励，这一严格条件限制了可发现的抽象数量，影响了MCTS的样本效率。

Method: 提出KVDA框架，不再要求状态-动作对价值相等，而是允许价值不同的状态-动作对分组，只要它们的价值差异可以被推断。KVDA-UCT通过分析即时奖励来推断价值差异。

Result: KVDA-UCT比OGA-UCT检测到显著更多的抽象，没有引入额外参数，在多种确定性环境和参数设置下表现优于OGA-UCT。

Conclusion: KVDA框架通过推断价值差异而非要求价值相等，有效提高了MCTS的抽象能力和样本效率，KVDA-UCT算法在性能上超越了现有方法。

Abstract: A core challenge of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is its sample efficiency,
which can be improved by grouping state-action pairs and using their aggregate
statistics instead of single-node statistics. On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT) is the state-of-the-art MCTS
abstraction algorithm for deterministic environments that builds its
abstraction using the Abstractions of State-Action Pairs (ASAP) framework,
which aims to detect states and state-action pairs with the same value under
optimal play by analysing the search graph. ASAP, however, requires two
state-action pairs to have the same immediate reward, which is a rigid
condition that limits the number of abstractions that can be found and thereby
the sample efficiency. In this paper, we break with the paradigm of grouping
value-equivalent states or state-action pairs and instead group states and
state-action pairs with possibly different values as long as the difference
between their values can be inferred. We call this abstraction framework Known
Value Difference Abstractions (KVDA), which infers the value differences by
analysis of the immediate rewards and modifies OGA-UCT to use this framework
instead. The modification is called KVDA-UCT, which detects significantly more
abstractions than OGA-UCT, introduces no additional parameter, and outperforms
OGA-UCT on a variety of deterministic environments and parameter settings.

Result: 发现范式选择具有战略性：符号系统主导安全关键领域（如医疗），而神经系统在适应性强的数据丰富环境中占优势（如金融）；同时识别出关键研究空白，包括符号系统治理模型不足和神经符号混合架构的需求。

Conclusion: 智能体AI的未来不在于单一范式的统治，而在于符号和神经范式的有意整合，以创建既适应性强又可靠的系统，这为未来研究、开发和政策提供了必要的概念工具包。

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a transformative shift in artificial intelligence, but
its rapid advancement has led to a fragmented understanding, often conflating
modern neural systems with outdated symbolic models -- a practice known as
conceptual retrofitting. This survey cuts through this confusion by introducing
a novel dual-paradigm framework that categorizes agentic systems into two
distinct lineages: the Symbolic/Classical (relying on algorithmic planning and
persistent state) and the Neural/Generative (leveraging stochastic generation
and prompt-driven orchestration). Through a systematic PRISMA-based review of
90 studies (2018--2025), we provide a comprehensive analysis structured around
this framework across three dimensions: (1) the theoretical foundations and
architectural principles defining each paradigm; (2) domain-specific
implementations in healthcare, finance, and robotics, demonstrating how
application constraints dictate paradigm selection; and (3) paradigm-specific
ethical and governance challenges, revealing divergent risks and mitigation
strategies. Our analysis reveals that the choice of paradigm is strategic:
symbolic systems dominate safety-critical domains (e.g., healthcare), while
neural systems prevail in adaptive, data-rich environments (e.g., finance).
Furthermore, we identify critical research gaps, including a significant
deficit in governance models for symbolic systems and a pressing need for
hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures. The findings culminate in a strategic
roadmap arguing that the future of Agentic AI lies not in the dominance of one
paradigm, but in their intentional integration to create systems that are both
adaptable and reliable. This work provides the essential conceptual toolkit to
guide future research, development, and policy toward robust and trustworthy
hybrid intelligent systems.

Abstract: In artificial intelligence (AI) alignment research, instrumental goals, also
called instrumental subgoals or instrumental convergent goals, are widely
associated with advanced AI systems. These goals, which include tendencies such
as power-seeking and self-preservation, become problematic when they conflict
with human aims. Conventional alignment theory treats instrumental goals as
sources of risk that become problematic through failure modes such as reward
hacking or goal misgeneralization, and attempts to limit the symptoms of
instrumental goals, notably resource acquisition and self-preservation. This
article proposes an alternative framing: that a philosophical argument can be
constructed according to which instrumental goals may be understood as features
to be accepted and managed rather than failures to be limited. Drawing on
Aristotle's ontology and its modern interpretations, an ontology of concrete,
goal-directed entities, it argues that advanced AI systems can be seen as
artifacts whose formal and material constitution gives rise to effects distinct
from their designers' intentions. In this view, the instrumental tendencies of
such systems correspond to per se outcomes of their constitution rather than
accidental malfunctions. The implication is that efforts should focus less on
eliminating instrumental goals and more on understanding, managing, and
directing them toward human-aligned ends.

TL;DR: 提出了MTIR-SQL框架，这是一个多轮工具集成推理的强化学习框架，用于改进Text-to-SQL任务。通过在执行过程中集成动态反馈和多轮工具调用，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖静态执行反馈，限制了实时错误纠正能力。集成多轮工具调用和动态反馈可以显著提高模型的适应性和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出了执行感知的多轮推理范式，在每个推理步骤中无缝集成数据库执行反馈。扩展了GRPO算法以适应复杂的多轮交互场景，并增加了轨迹过滤机制和移除了KL损失约束。

Result: MTIR-SQL在BIRD Dev数据集上达到64.4%的准确率，在SPIDER Dev数据集上达到84.6%的执行准确率，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MTIR-SQL框架通过多轮工具集成推理和动态反馈机制，有效提升了Text-to-SQL任务的性能，证明了该方法在复杂数据库查询生成中的有效性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in Text-to-SQL tasks,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a common method for improving
performance. Existing methods primarily rely on static execution feedback,
which restricts real-time error correction. However, integrating multi-turn
tool invocation along with dynamic feedback could significantly improve
adaptability and robustness, ultimately enhancing model performance. To address
these issues, we propose MTIR-SQL, an innovative Multi-turn Tool-Integrated
Reasoning reinforcement learning framework for Text-to-SQL. Our approach
introduces an execution-aware multi-turn reasoning paradigm that seamlessly
incorporates database execution feedback at each reasoning step, enabling
context-sensitive query generation and progressive refinement throughout the
reasoning process. The framework extends the GRPO algorithm to accommodate
complex multi-turn interaction scenarios. Considering the training instability
characteristics of MTIR and the potential for significant Deviation of model
distribution from the initial model, we enhance the GRPO algorithm by adding a
trajectory filtering mechanism and removing KL loss constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that MTIR-SQL, with 4B parameters, achieves \textbf{64.4}\%
accuracy in the BIRD Dev and 84.6% execution accuracy in the SPIDER Dev,
significantly outperforming existing approaches.

Motivation: 在归纳逻辑编程中，各种规则生成方法会产生包含未命名谓词的规则，这影响了逻辑理论的可读性、可解释性和可重用性

Method: 利用LLMs处理自然语言和代码的能力，为未命名谓词提供语义上有意义的命名建议

Result: 在手工制作的逻辑规则上评估表明，LLMs在这项任务上具有潜力

Conclusion: LLMs在逻辑规则谓词命名任务中展现出应用前景

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of giving names to predicates in logic
rules using Large Language Models (LLMs). In the context of Inductive Logic
Programming, various rule generation methods produce rules containing unnamed
predicates, with Predicate Invention being a key example. This hinders the
readability, interpretability, and reusability of the logic theory. Leveraging
recent advancements in LLMs development, we explore their ability to process
natural language and code to provide semantically meaningful suggestions for
giving a name to unnamed predicates. The evaluation of our approach on some
hand-crafted logic rules indicates that LLMs hold potential for this task.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often face limitations in
specialized domains such as fintech, where domain-specific ontologies, dense
terminology, and acronyms complicate effective retrieval and synthesis. This
paper introduces an agentic RAG architecture designed to address these
challenges through a modular pipeline of specialized agents. The proposed
system supports intelligent query reformulation, iterative sub-query
decomposition guided by keyphrase extraction, contextual acronym resolution,
and cross-encoder-based context re-ranking. We evaluate our approach against a
standard RAG baseline using a curated dataset of 85 question--answer--reference
triples derived from an enterprise fintech knowledge base. Experimental results
demonstrate that the agentic RAG system outperforms the baseline in retrieval
precision and relevance, albeit with increased latency. These findings suggest
that structured, multi-agent methodologies offer a promising direction for
enhancing retrieval robustness in complex, domain-specific settings.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效提升模型在可验证和不可验证领域的推理能力，实现推理能力在不同领域间的迁移。

Abstract: Zero Reinforcement Learning (Zero-RL) has proven to be an effective approach
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by
directly applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards on pretrained
models, without the need for a supervised fine-tuning phase. However, current
research on zero-RL primarily focuses on domains with easily verifiable reward
signals, such as mathematics, programming, and other reasoning tasks. The
challenge of eliciting reasoning abilities in more diverse scenarios, where
verification is not straightforward, remains underexplored. To address this
gap, we propose a novel zero-RL paradigm designed to improve a model's
reasoning ability across both verifiable and non-verifiable domains. By
combining verifiable rewards with a generative reward model, we conduct
multi-task zero-RL training across both domains, facilitating the transfer of
reasoning capabilities between them. Furthermore, to mitigate reward hacking in
the generative reward model, we design a smooth length penalty that encourages
the generation of more comprehensive thinking tokens in general domains.
Experimental results on Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-14B-Base demonstrate that our
approach achieves superior reasoning performance, not only on tasks requiring
extensive reasoning but also on more general tasks.

Conclusion: MoGE通过生成关键状态和动态一致的经验，成功解决了被动探索的局限性，为强化学习探索提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Exploration is fundamental to reinforcement learning (RL), as it determines
how effectively an agent discovers and exploits the underlying structure of its
environment to achieve optimal performance. Existing exploration methods
generally fall into two categories: active exploration and passive exploration.
The former introduces stochasticity into the policy but struggles in
high-dimensional environments, while the latter adaptively prioritizes
transitions in the replay buffer to enhance exploration, yet remains
constrained by limited sample diversity. To address the limitation in passive
exploration, we propose Modelic Generative Exploration (MoGE), which augments
exploration through the generation of under-explored critical states and
synthesis of dynamics-consistent experiences through transition models. MoGE is
composed of two components: (1) a diffusion-based generator that synthesizes
critical states under the guidance of a utility function evaluating each
state's potential influence on policy exploration, and (2) a one-step
imagination world model for constructing critical transitions based on the
critical states for agent learning. Our method adopts a modular formulation
that aligns with the principles of off-policy learning, allowing seamless
integration with existing algorithms to improve exploration without altering
their core structures. Empirical results on OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control
Suite reveal that MoGE effectively bridges exploration and policy learning,
leading to remarkable gains in both sample efficiency and performance across
complex control tasks.

Abstract: The diagnosis of most mental disorders, including psychiatric evaluations,
primarily depends on dialogues between psychiatrists and patients. This
subjective process can lead to variability in diagnoses across clinicians and
patients, resulting in inconsistencies and challenges in achieving reliable
outcomes. To address these issues and standardize psychiatric diagnoses, we
propose a Fine-Tuned Large Language Model (LLM) Consortium and OpenAI-gpt-oss
Reasoning LLM-enabled Decision Support System for the clinical diagnosis of
mental disorders. Our approach leverages fine-tuned LLMs trained on
conversational datasets involving psychiatrist-patient interactions focused on
mental health conditions (e.g., depression). The diagnostic predictions from
individual models are aggregated through a consensus-based decision-making
process, refined by the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM. We propose a novel method
for deploying LLM agents that orchestrate communication between the LLM
consortium and the reasoning LLM, ensuring transparency, reliability, and
responsible AI across the entire diagnostic workflow. Experimental results
demonstrate the transformative potential of combining fine-tuned LLMs with a
reasoning model to create a robust and highly accurate diagnostic system for
mental health assessment. A prototype of the proposed platform, integrating
three fine-tuned LLMs with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM, was developed in
collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research Team in Norfolk, Virginia,
USA. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first application
of a fine-tuned LLM consortium integrated with a reasoning LLM for clinical
mental health diagnosis paving the way for next-generation AI-powered eHealth
systems aimed at standardizing psychiatric diagnoses.

Motivation: 由于现有方法只进行静态结构分析，不适合推理时执行，且没有方法能评估每个智能体对AAW最终输出的影响程度。

Method: 使用反事实分析技术，通过修改智能体的输出来观察对最终结果的影响，从而评估各智能体的影响力。

Result: 在包含30个不同用例和230个功能的AAW数据集上评估，CAIR产生一致的排名，优于基线方法，并能有效提升下游任务的效果和相关性。

Conclusion: CAIR是首个能够评估多智能体系统中各智能体影响力的方法，为理解和优化AAW系统提供了重要工具。

Abstract: An Agentic AI Workflow (AAW), also known as an LLM-based multi-agent system,
is an autonomous system that assembles several LLM-based agents to work
collaboratively towards a shared goal. The high autonomy, widespread adoption,
and growing interest in such AAWs highlight the need for a deeper understanding
of their operations, from both quality and security aspects. To this day, there
are no existing methods to assess the influence of each agent on the AAW's
final output. Adopting techniques from related fields is not feasible since
existing methods perform only static structural analysis, which is unsuitable
for inference time execution. We present Counterfactual-based Agent Influence
Ranker (CAIR) - the first method for assessing the influence level of each
agent on the AAW's output and determining which agents are the most
influential. By performing counterfactual analysis, CAIR provides a
task-agnostic analysis that can be used both offline and at inference time. We
evaluate CAIR using an AAWs dataset of our creation, containing 30 different
use cases with 230 different functionalities. Our evaluation showed that CAIR
produces consistent rankings, outperforms baseline methods, and can easily
enhance the effectiveness and relevancy of downstream tasks.

Method: 采用流感知的PPO算法结合GTrXL架构，让智能体获得更丰富的湍流场信息，并与PPO+LSTM、PPO+GTrXL无预测任务版本和传统Zermelo导航算法进行比较。

Result: 相比PPO+LSTM、PPO+GTrXL和传统Zermelo算法，该方法显著提高了成功率(SR)并降低了碰撞率(CR)。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂城市环境中无人机的导航开辟了新途径，有望重新定义无人机在城市环境中的应用前景。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly populating urban areas for
delivery and surveillance purposes. In this work, we develop an optimal
navigation strategy based on Deep Reinforcement Learning. The environment is
represented by a three-dimensional high-fidelity simulation of an urban flow,
characterized by turbulence and recirculation zones. The algorithm presented
here is a flow-aware Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) combined with a Gated
Transformer eXtra Large (GTrXL) architecture, giving the agent richer
information about the turbulent flow field in which it navigates. The results
are compared with a PPO+GTrXL without the secondary prediction tasks, a PPO
combined with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells and a traditional navigation
algorithm. The obtained results show a significant increase in the success rate
(SR) and a lower crash rate (CR) compared to a PPO+LSTM, PPO+GTrXL and the
classical Zermelo's navigation algorithm, paving the way to a completely
reimagined UAV landscape in complex urban environments.

Motivation: 现有检索增强生成方法独立处理检索块，难以进行多跳或关系推理；传统知识图谱因严格的三元组结构会丢失非结构化信息。

Method: 提出BambooKG，在非三元组边上应用基于频率的权重来反映链接强度，借鉴赫布原理的"一起激活，一起连接"思想。

Result: 减少了信息损失，在单跳和多跳推理任务上性能提升，超越现有解决方案。

Conclusion: BambooKG通过频率加权边有效捕获非三元组信息，改善了知识图谱在推理任务中的表现。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation allows LLMs to access external knowledge,
reducing hallucinations and ageing-data issues. However, it treats retrieved
chunks independently and struggles with multi-hop or relational reasoning,
especially across documents. Knowledge graphs enhance this by capturing the
relationships between entities using triplets, enabling structured, multi-chunk
reasoning. However, these tend to miss information that fails to conform to the
triplet structure. We introduce BambooKG, a knowledge graph with
frequency-based weights on non-triplet edges which reflect link strength,
drawing on the Hebbian principle of "fire together, wire together". This
decreases information loss and results in improved performance on single- and
multi-hop reasoning, outperforming the existing solutions.

Motivation: 现有心理咨询LLM方法缺乏情感理解、自适应策略和跨会话治疗方法的长期记忆，与真实临床实践差距较大。

Method: 提出新颖的双循环架构：会话内循环用于战术对话管理，感知患者情绪状态动态选择响应策略；跨会话循环用于战略治疗规划，评估治疗效果并调整后续方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) in psychological counseling have attracted
increasing attention. However, existing approaches often lack emotional
understanding, adaptive strategies, and the use of therapeutic methods across
multiple sessions with long-term memory, leaving them far from real clinical
practice. To address these critical gaps, we introduce TheraMind, a strategic
and adaptive agent for longitudinal psychological counseling. The cornerstone
of TheraMind is a novel dual-loop architecture that decouples the complex
counseling process into an Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue management
and a Cross-Session Loop for strategic therapeutic planning. The Intra-Session
Loop perceives the patient's emotional state to dynamically select response
strategies while leveraging cross-session memory to ensure continuity.
Crucially, the Cross-Session Loop empowers the agent with long-term
adaptability by evaluating the efficacy of the applied therapy after each
session and adjusting the method for subsequent interactions. We validate our
approach in a high-fidelity simulation environment grounded in real clinical
cases. Extensive evaluations show that TheraMind outperforms other methods,
especially on multi-session metrics like Coherence, Flexibility, and
Therapeutic Attunement, validating the effectiveness of its dual-loop design in
emulating strategic, adaptive, and longitudinal therapeutic behavior. The code
is publicly available at https://0mwwm0.github.io/TheraMind/.

Abstract: Live streaming plays a major role in today's digital platforms, supporting
entertainment, education, social media, etc. However, research in this field is
limited by the lack of large, publicly available datasets that capture
real-time viewer behavior at scale. To address this gap, we introduce YTLive, a
public dataset focused on YouTube Live. Collected through the YouTube
Researcher Program over May and June 2024, YTLive includes more than 507000
records from 12156 live streams, tracking concurrent viewer counts at
five-minute intervals along with precise broadcast durations. We describe the
dataset design and collection process and present an initial analysis of
temporal viewing patterns. Results show that viewer counts are higher and more
stable on weekends, especially during afternoon hours. Shorter streams attract
larger and more consistent audiences, while longer streams tend to grow slowly
and exhibit greater variability. These insights have direct implications for
adaptive streaming, resource allocation, and Quality of Experience (QoE)
modeling. YTLive offers a timely, open resource to support reproducible
research and system-level innovation in live streaming. The dataset is publicly

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: PureKV是一个即插即用的框架，通过联合优化稀疏注意力和KV缓存压缩来解决VLLMs处理高分辨率输入时的效率问题，实现了5倍KV缓存压缩和3.16倍预填充加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLLMs在处理高分辨率输入时面临效率挑战，二次复杂度的注意力和自回归生成以及不断增长的KV缓存严重阻碍了预填充和解码阶段。现有KV缓存压缩方法不兼容高效注意力机制，且忽视了稀疏注意力对KV缓存信息结构的影响。

Method: 提出PureKV框架：1）使用低层注意力分数估计高层KV缓存重要性的压缩策略，兼容高效注意力加速器；2）设计时空稀疏注意力模块，结合空间和时间注意力稀疏性来净化KV缓存中的空间噪声和时间冗余。

Result: 在VideoLLaMA2和Qwen2.5-VL上的实验表明，PureKV实现了5.0倍KV缓存压缩和3.16倍预填充加速，质量损失可忽略不计。

Conclusion: PureKV通过联合优化稀疏注意力和KV缓存压缩，有效解决了VLLMs的效率瓶颈，同时保持模型质量。

Abstract: Vision-Language Large Models (VLLMs) face significant efficiency challenges
when processing high-resolution inputs. The quadratic complexity in attention
and autoregressive generation, as well as the constantly growing key value (KV)
cache size, severely hinder the prefilling and decoding stages. Recent efforts
have attempted to compress KV cache by identifying and pruning KV cache of less
important tokens, but these methods typically rely on attention scores to
estimate token importance, making them incompatible with efficient attention
mechanisms such as FlashAttention and Sparse Attention, which do not explicitly
compute attention matrices. Moreover, existing methods overlook how sparse
attention, while accelerating the prefilling stage, alters the information
structure of the KV cache, thereby compromising the effectiveness of downstream
KV cache compression strategies. To address this issue, we propose PureKV, a
plug-and-play framework for joint optimization of sparse attention and KV cache
compression. We first introduce a KV cache compression strategy that is fully
compatible with efficient attention accelerators. Our method utilizes lower
layer attention scores to estimate the importance of high layers' KV cache,
enabling active pruning without compromising accuracy. In addition, we have
designed a Spatial-Temporal Sparse Attention (ST-SpAttn) module specifically
tailored for video KV cache compression algorithms. This module combines
spatial and temporal attention sparsity to improve the compression efficiency
of KV cache optimization algorithms by purifying spatial noise and temporal
redundancy in KV cache. At the same time, ST-SpAttn also accelerated the
prefilling stage of VLLMs. Extensive experiments on VLLMs (VideoLLaMA2,
Qwen2.5-VL) have shown that PureKV achieves 5.0 times KV cache compression and
3.16 times prefill acceleration, with negligible quality degradation.

*Ayelet Amster,Lioz Akirav,Rica Gonen,Erel Segal-Halevi*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文通过实证研究发现，常用的预算效用函数模型（如ℓ₁、ℓ₂和Leontief）对人类偏好的解释力有限，但支持星形偏好和峰值线性效用函数，这对预算聚合机制设计有重要启示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证预算聚合机制中常用的效用函数模型是否准确反映人类真实偏好，因为现有理论缺乏实证证据支持。

Method: 通过结构化调查，测试人类参与者的偏好是否符合ℓ₁、ℓ₂、Leontief等常用效用函数模型，并检验项目对称性和符号对称性等核心假设。

Result: 大多数参与者在不同度量比较中表现出不一致模式，标准距离度量的核心假设缺乏实证支持，但大多数参与者符合星形偏好和峰值线性效用函数。

Conclusion: 需要采用替代建模方法，本研究为实证检验预算聚合理论中的效用函数假设提供了系统方法，有助于设计更稳健和现实的机制。

Abstract: While participatory budgeting and budget-aggregation mechanisms require
assumptions about how voters evaluate non-ideal budget allocations, little
empirical evidence exists to validate which utility models accurately capture
human preferences. We conducted structured polls with human participants to
test whether real people's preferences conform to commonly assumed utility
functions such as $\ell_1$, $\ell_2$ and Leontief. Our results suggest that
these models may have limited explanatory power for actual behavior: most
participants showed inconsistent patterns across different metric comparisons,
and standard assumptions of project symmetry and sign symmetry -- core features
of common distance-based metrics -- received little empirical support. However,
we find encouraging evidence for more fundamental preference structures: a
large majority of participants showed consistency with star-shaped preferences,
as well as with peak-linear utility functions, where utility changes
proportionally with distance from the ideal budget. These findings have
important implications for designers of budget aggregation mechanisms. While
theoretical results demonstrate impossibility results for standard distance
metrics regarding truthfulness, Pareto-efficiency, and proportionality, our
evidence suggests alternative modeling approaches may be warranted. More
broadly, this work introduces a systematic methodology to empirically test the
utility function assumptions that underpin budget aggregation theories, paving
the way for more robust and realistic mechanism design.

Abstract: We consider the problem of payoff division in indivisible coalitional games,
where the value of the grand coalition is a natural number. This number
represents a certain quantity of indivisible objects, such as parliamentary
seats, kidney exchanges, or top features contributing to the outcome of a
machine learning model. The goal of this paper is to propose a fair method for
dividing these objects among players. To achieve this, we define the
indivisible Shapley value and study its properties. We demonstrate our proposed
technique using three case studies, in particular, we use it to identify key
regions of an image in the context of an image classification task.

### [276] [Monopoly Deal: A Benchmark Environment for Bounded One-Sided Response Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25080)
*Will Wolf*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文介绍了有界单边响应游戏(BORGs)这一新的游戏结构，并以Monopoly Deal作为基准环境，证明CFR算法能有效处理这种动态，无需新算法扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索一种较少研究但策略丰富的游戏结构——有界单边响应，这种动态发生在玩家行动短暂转移控制权给对手时，对手必须通过一个或多个顺序移动来满足固定条件。

Method: 引入修改版的Monopoly Deal作为基准环境，使用反事实遗憾最小化(CFR)算法，并开发了一个轻量级全栈研究平台，集成了环境、并行CFR运行时和可玩网页界面。

Result: CFR算法成功收敛到该领域的有效策略，无需新算法扩展。训练好的CFR代理和源代码已在monopolydeal.ai提供。

Conclusion: 该系统为在有界单边响应设置中探索状态表示和策略学习提供了实用基础，CFR算法能有效处理这种游戏动态。

Abstract: Card games are widely used to study sequential decision-making under
uncertainty, with real-world analogues in negotiation, finance, and
cybersecurity. Typically, these games fall into three categories based on the
flow of control: strictly-sequential (where players alternate single actions),
deterministic-response (where some actions trigger a fixed outcome), and
unbounded reciprocal-response (where alternating counterplays are permitted). A
less-explored but strategically rich structure exists: the bounded one-sided
response. This dynamic occurs when a player's action briefly transfers control
to the opponent, who must satisfy a fixed condition through one or more
sequential moves before the turn resolves. We term games featuring this
mechanism Bounded One-Sided Response Games (BORGs).
  We introduce a modified version of Monopoly Deal as a benchmark environment
that specifically isolates the BORG dynamic, where a Rent action forces the
opponent to sequentially choose payment assets. We demonstrate that the
gold-standard algorithm, Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR), successfully
converges on effective strategies for this domain without requiring novel
algorithmic extensions. To support efficient, reproducible experimentation, we
present a lightweight, full-stack research platform that unifies the
environment, a parallelized CFR runtime, and a human-playable web interface,
all runnable on a single workstation. This system provides a practical
foundation for exploring state representation and policy learning in bounded
one-sided response settings.
  The trained CFR agent and source code are available at

### [277] [Timing Games in Responsive Consensus Protocols](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25144)
*Kaya Alpturer,Kushal Babel,Aditya Saraf*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文通过引入动态区块奖励和投票机制来解决区块链共识协议中的时间博弈问题，激励验证者及时提出区块，从而实现乐观响应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区块链应用中验证者存在延迟提案的时间博弈动机，因为区块时间增加会带来更高奖励，这使得响应性在区块链协议中看似不可能实现。

Method: 开发了响应性共识协议中的时间博弈模型，引入动态区块奖励（随轮次时间递减），并通过投票机制让其他验证者对当前领导者的轮次时间进行投票测量延迟。

Result: 通过精心设置协议参数，投票机制允许验证者协调达到合作均衡，通过更高的奖励率使所有参与者受益，证明响应性本身可以促进更快的区块提案。

Conclusion: 尽管从静态奖励转向动态奖励会使验证者效用对延迟更敏感，但理论和模拟分析表明这种影响很小，响应性可以在区块链协议中实现。

Abstract: Optimistic responsiveness -- the ability of a consensus protocol to operate
at the speed of the network -- is widely used in consensus protocol design to
optimize latency and throughput. However, blockchain applications incentivize
validators to play timing games by strategically delaying their proposals,
since increased block time correlates with greater rewards. Consequently, it
may appear that responsiveness (even under optimistic conditions) is impossible
in blockchain protocols. In this work, we develop a model of timing games in
responsive consensus protocols and find a prisoner's dilemma structure, where
cooperation (proposing promptly) is in the validators' best interest, but
individual incentives encourage validators to delay proposals selfishly. To
attain desirable equilibria, we introduce dynamic block rewards that decrease
with round time to explicitly incentivize faster proposals. Delays are measured
through a voting mechanism, where other validators vote on the current leader's
round time. By carefully setting the protocol parameters, the voting mechanism
allows validators to coordinate and reach the cooperative equilibrium,
benefiting all through a higher rate-of-reward. Thus, instead of responsiveness
being an unattainable property due to timing games, we show that responsiveness
itself can promote faster block proposals. One consequence of moving from a
static to dynamic block reward is that validator utilities become more
sensitive to latency, worsening the gap between the best- and worst-connected
validators. Our analysis shows, however, that this effect is minor in both
theoretical latency models and simulations based on real-world networks.

### [278] [On Robust Popular Matchings with Tie-Bounded Preferences and Stable Matchings with Two-Sided Ties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25209)
*Koustav De*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了二分图中稳健流行匹配的存在性问题，分别在单边模型和双边单边平局模型中分析了当只有一个代理改变偏好顺序时，是否存在稳健流行匹配，并提出了多项式时间算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在多个实例中保持流行的稳健匹配，特别是在代理偏好顺序发生变化的情况下，确保匹配的稳定性和鲁棒性。

Method: 使用图论和匹配理论，分析单边模型和双边单边平局模型中的流行匹配特性，提出多项式时间算法来判定稳健流行匹配的存在性。

Result: 给出了双边单边平局模型中流行匹配的简单特征，证明了在只有一个代理改变偏好顺序时，存在多项式时间算法判定稳健流行匹配的存在性。

Conclusion: 在特定约束条件下，稳健流行匹配问题可以在多项式时间内解决，这为实际应用中的匹配稳定性提供了理论保证。

Abstract: We are given a bipartite graph $G = \left( A \cup B, E \right)$. In the
one-sided model, every $a \in A$ (often called agents) ranks its neighbours $z
\in N_{a}$ strictly, and no $b \in B$ has any preference order over its
neighbours $y \in N_{b}$, and vertices in $B$ abstain from casting their votes
to matchings. In the two-sided model with one-sided ties, every $a \in A$ ranks
its neighbours $z \in N_{a}$ strictly, and every $b \in B$ puts all of its
neighbours into a single large tie, i.e., $b \in B$ prefers every $y \in N_{b}$
equally. In this two-sided model with one-sided ties, when two matchings
compete in a majority election, $b \in B$ abstains from casting its vote for a
matching when both the matchings saturate $b$ or both leave $b$ unsaturated;
else $b$ prefers the matching where it is saturated. A popular matching $M$ is
\emph{robust} if it remains popular among multiple instances.
  We have analysed the cases when a robust popular matching exists in the
one-sided model where only one agent alters her preference order among the
instances, and we have proposed a polynomial-time algorithm to decide if there
exists a robust popular matching when instances differ only with respect to the
preference orders of a single agent.
  We give a simple characterisation of popular matchings in the two-sided model
with one-sided ties. We show that in the two-sided model with one-sided ties,
if the input instances differ only with respect to the preference orders of a
single agent, there is a polynomial-time algorithm to decide whether there
exists a robust popular matching. We have been able to decide the stable
matching problem in bipartite graphs $G = (A \cup B, E)$ where \textit{both}
sides have weak preferences (ties allowed), with the restriction that every tie
has length at most $k$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线竞价是经典优化问题，在在线决策、可中断系统设计和近似算法分析中有广泛应用。现有研究主要关注不利用预测质量随机信息的预测器和确定性算法，本文旨在探索结合随机性的学习增强设置。

Method: 第一部分研究基于分布预测的竞价，提出帕累托最优算法以在算法一致性和鲁棒性之间提供最佳权衡；第二部分研究随机竞价算法的能力与局限性，给出一致性/鲁棒性权衡的上下界。

Result: 提出了在分布预测设置下的帕累托最优竞价算法，以及随机竞价算法在一致性/鲁棒性权衡方面的上下界结果。

Conclusion: 本文扩展了在线竞价问题的研究范围，通过引入预测随机性和算法随机性，为学习增强设置下的在线竞价提供了新的算法框架和理论分析。

Abstract: Online bidding is a classic optimization problem, with several applications
in online decision-making, the design of interruptible systems, and the
analysis of approximation algorithms. In this work, we study online bidding
under learning-augmented settings that incorporate stochasticity, in either the
prediction oracle or the algorithm itself. In the first part, we study bidding
under distributional predictions, and find Pareto-optimal algorithms that offer
the best-possible tradeoff between the consistency and the robustness of the
algorithm. In the second part, we study the power and limitations of randomized
bidding algorithms, by presenting upper and lower bounds on the
consistency/robustness tradeoffs. Previous works focused predominantly on
oracles that do not leverage stochastic information on the quality of the
prediction, and deterministic algorithms.

Motivation: 传统两阶段重排方法存在生成器和评估器分离导致的端到端训练困难，以及自回归生成器推理效率低的问题。

Method: 提出Gen-Reranker模型（双向编码器+动态自回归解码器），通过预训练和Rerank-DPO后训练实现端到端优化，使用有序多令牌预测提升推理效率。

Conclusion: GReF框架有效解决了重排任务中的端到端训练和推理效率挑战，在真实推荐系统中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: In a multi-stage recommendation system, reranking plays a crucial role in
modeling intra-list correlations among items. A key challenge lies in exploring
optimal sequences within the combinatorial space of permutations. Recent
research follows a two-stage (generator-evaluator) paradigm, where a generator
produces multiple feasible sequences, and an evaluator selects the best one. In
practice, the generator is typically implemented as an autoregressive model.
However, these two-stage methods face two main challenges. First, the
separation of the generator and evaluator hinders end-to-end training. Second,
autoregressive generators suffer from inference efficiency. In this work, we
propose a Unified Generative Efficient Reranking Framework (GReF) to address
the two primary challenges. Specifically, we introduce Gen-Reranker, an
autoregressive generator featuring a bidirectional encoder and a dynamic
autoregressive decoder to generate causal reranking sequences. Subsequently, we
pre-train Gen-Reranker on the item exposure order for high-quality parameter
initialization. To eliminate the need for the evaluator while integrating
sequence-level evaluation during training for end-to-end optimization, we
propose post-training the model through Rerank-DPO. Moreover, for efficient
autoregressive inference, we introduce ordered multi-token prediction (OMTP),
which trains Gen-Reranker to simultaneously generate multiple future items
while preserving their order, ensuring practical deployment in real-time
recommender systems. Extensive offline experiments demonstrate that GReF
outperforms state-of-the-art reranking methods while achieving latency that is
nearly comparable to non-autoregressive models. Additionally, GReF has also
been deployed in a real-world video app Kuaishou with over 300 million daily
active users, significantly improving online recommendation quality.

*Yehjin Shin,Jeongwhan Choi,Seojin Kim,Noseong Park*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出TV-Rec模型，使用时间变异的卷积滤波器替代固定核和自注意力机制，在序列推荐中捕获位置依赖的时间变化，提高表达能力并减少计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卷积滤波器通常为固定滤波器，难以捕获序列推荐中所需的全局交互模式，需要依赖自注意力机制作为补充。

Method: 受图信号处理启发，使用时间变异的图滤波器来捕获用户序列中位置依赖的时间变化，替代固定核和自注意力机制。

Result: 在六个公共基准测试中，TV-Rec平均优于最先进基线方法7.49%。

Conclusion: 时间变异滤波器设计不仅消除了对自注意力的需求，还减少了计算量并加速了推理过程，能够更好地捕获用户行为中的复杂交互模式。

Abstract: Recently, convolutional filters have been increasingly adopted in sequential
recommendation for their ability to capture local sequential patterns. However,
most of these models complement convolutional filters with self-attention. This
is because convolutional filters alone, generally fixed filters, struggle to
capture global interactions necessary for accurate recommendation. We propose
Time-Variant Convolutional Filters for Sequential Recommendation (TV-Rec), a
model inspired by graph signal processing, where time-variant graph filters
capture position-dependent temporal variations in user sequences. By replacing
both fixed kernels and self-attention with time-variant filters, TV-Rec
achieves higher expressive power and better captures complex interaction
patterns in user behavior. This design not only eliminates the need for
self-attention but also reduces computation while accelerating inference.
Extensive experiments on six public benchmarks show that TV-Rec outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 7.49%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推荐系统中项目多面性特征和用户上下文中动态项目相关性的挑战，提升推荐模型的可扩展性和效果。

Method: 将传统的单一嵌入矩阵分解为多个低维嵌入矩阵，并在Fuxi Block中用MoE层替换相关参数，实现自适应和专业化表示转换。

Result: 在公共数据集上的实验结果表明，该框架优于多个竞争基线方法。

Conclusion: Fuxi-MME通过多嵌入和MoE架构有效提升了推荐系统的性能，能够更好地捕捉项目特征和动态相关性。

Abstract: In recommendation systems, how to effectively scale up recommendation models
has been an essential research topic. While significant progress has been made
in developing advanced and scalable architectures for sequential
recommendation(SR) models, there are still challenges due to items'
multi-faceted characteristics and dynamic item relevance in the user context.
To address these issues, we propose Fuxi-MME, a framework that integrates a
multi-embedding strategy with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture.
Specifically, to efficiently capture diverse item characteristics in a
decoupled manner, we decompose the conventional single embedding matrix into
several lower-dimensional embedding matrices. Additionally, by substituting
relevant parameters in the Fuxi Block with an MoE layer, our model achieves
adaptive and specialized transformation of the enriched representations.
Empirical results on public datasets show that our proposed framework
outperforms several competitive baselines.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出一个专利质量评估框架，通过合规性、技术连贯性和图文一致性检测模块评估专利质量，并在综合数据集上验证有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管专利申请激增且AI起草工具涌现，但专利内容质量的系统性评估研究有限，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 使用监管合规性、技术连贯性和图文一致性检测三个模块评估专利质量，并通过集成模块生成改进建议。在包含80个人工撰写和80个AI生成专利的数据集上进行验证。

Result: 三个检测模块在专家标注验证下的平衡准确率分别为99.74%、82.12%和91.2%。AI生成专利相比人工撰写存在显著差距，主要存在图文对齐和交叉引用等结构缺陷。

Conclusion: 专利质量评估框架有效识别不同类型缺陷，机械工程和建筑领域因复杂技术文档要求更容易出现权利要求-说明书不一致，AI生成专利需要特别关注结构性问题。

Abstract: Despite the surge in patent applications and emergence of AI drafting tools,
systematic evaluation of patent content quality has received limited research
attention. To address this gap, We propose to evaluate patents using regulatory
compliance, technical coherence, and figure-reference consistency detection
modules, and then generate improvement suggestions via an integration module.
The framework is validated on a comprehensive dataset comprising 80
human-authored and 80 AI-generated patents from two patent drafting tools.
Experimental results show balanced accuracies of 99.74\%, 82.12\%, and 91.2\%
respectively across the three detection modules when validated against expert
annotations. Additional analysis was conducted to examine defect distributions
across patent sections, technical domains, and authoring sources. Section-based
analysis indicates that figure-text consistency and technical detail precision
require particular attention. Mechanical Engineering and Construction show more
claim-specification inconsistencies due to complex technical documentation
requirements. AI-generated patents show a significant gap compared to
human-authored ones. While human-authored patents primarily contain
surface-level errors like typos, AI-generated patents exhibit more structural
defects in figure-text alignment and cross-references.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统查询重写方法基于两个主要假设：相关性假设（顶部文档是相关的）和模型假设（重写方法需要针对特定模型架构设计），这些假设限制了方法的通用性和效果。

Method: 设计了基于强化学习的面向效用训练流程，确保对噪声反馈的鲁棒性。GPRF框架执行模型无关的自然语言重写，基于检索文档而非仅依赖相关性假设。

Result: 在多个基准测试和检索器上的广泛实验表明，GPRF始终优于强基线方法，证明了其作为查询重写框架的有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: GPRF是一个有效且可泛化的查询重写框架，通过放松传统假设并提供鲁棒的训练机制，在各种设置下都能取得一致的性能提升。

Abstract: Query rewriting is a fundamental technique in information retrieval (IR). It
typically employs the retrieval result as relevance feedback to refine the
query and thereby addresses the vocabulary mismatch between user queries and
relevant documents. Traditional pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) and its
vector-based extension (VPRF) improve retrieval performance by leveraging
top-retrieved documents as relevance feedback. However, they are constructed
based on two major hypotheses: the relevance assumption (top documents are
relevant) and the model assumption (rewriting methods need to be designed
specifically for particular model architectures). While recent large language
models (LLMs)-based generative relevance feedback (GRF) enables model-free
query reformulation, it either suffers from severe LLM hallucination or, again,
relies on the relevance assumption to guarantee the effectiveness of rewriting
quality. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an assumption-relaxed
framework: \textit{Generalized Pseudo Relevance Feedback} (GPRF), which
performs model-free, natural language rewriting based on retrieved documents,
not only eliminating the model assumption but also reducing dependence on the
relevance assumption. Specifically, we design a utility-oriented training
pipeline with reinforcement learning to ensure robustness against noisy
feedback. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and retrievers
demonstrate that GPRF consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing
it as an effective and generalizable framework for query rewriting.

Conclusion: ADA-SID框架通过自适应对齐、去噪和放大机制，有效解决了内容语义ID在推荐系统中的关键限制，提升了推荐性能。

Abstract: Industrial recommender systems rely on unique Item Identifiers (ItemIDs).
However, this method struggles with scalability and generalization in large,
dynamic datasets that have sparse long-tail data.Content-based Semantic IDs
(SIDs) address this by sharing knowledge through content quantization. However,
by ignoring dynamic behavioral properties, purely content-based SIDs have
limited expressive power. Existing methods attempt to incorporate behavioral
information but overlook a critical distinction: unlike relatively uniform
content features, user-item interactions are highly skewed and diverse,
creating a vast information gap in quality and quantity between popular and
long-tail items. This oversight leads to two critical limitations: (1) Noise
Corruption: Indiscriminate behavior-content alignment allows collaborative
noise from long-tail items to corrupt their content representations, leading to
the loss of critical multimodal information. (2)Signal Obscurity: The
equal-weighting scheme for SIDs fails to reflect the varying importance of
different behavioral signals, making it difficult for downstream tasks to
distinguish important SIDs from uninformative ones. To tackle these issues, we
propose a mixture-of-quantization framework, MMQ-v2, to adaptively Align,
Denoise, and Amplify multimodal information from content and behavior
modalities for semantic IDs learning. The semantic IDs generated by this
framework named ADA-SID. It introduces two innovations: an adaptive
behavior-content alignment that is aware of information richness to shield
representations from noise, and a dynamic behavioral router to amplify critical
signals by applying different weights to SIDs. Extensive experiments on public
and large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate ADA-SID's significant
superiority in both generative and discriminative recommendation tasks.
