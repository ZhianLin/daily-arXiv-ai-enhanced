Abstract: As the computer vision community advances autonomous driving algorithms,
integrating vision-based insights with sensor data remains essential for
improving perception, decision making, planning, prediction, simulation, and
control. Yet we must ask: Why don't we have entirely safe self-driving cars
yet? A key part of the answer lies in addressing novel scenarios, one of the
most critical barriers to real-world deployment. Our 2COOOL workshop provides a
dedicated forum for researchers and industry experts to push the state of the
art in novelty handling, including out-of-distribution hazard detection,
vision-language models for hazard understanding, new benchmarking and
methodologies, and safe autonomous driving practices. The 2nd Workshop on the
Challenge of Out-of-Label Hazards in Autonomous Driving (2COOOL) will be held
at the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025 in Honolulu,
Hawaii, on October 19, 2025. We aim to inspire the development of new
algorithms and systems for hazard avoidance, drawing on ideas from anomaly
detection, open-set recognition, open-vocabulary modeling, domain adaptation,
and related fields. Building on the success of its inaugural edition at the
Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2025, the workshop
will feature a mix of academic and industry participation.

*Alireza Golkarieh,Kiana Kiashemshaki,Sajjad Rezvani Boroujeni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了三种深度学习模型（自定义CNN、混合模型和预训练模型）在牙科全景X射线图像分类中的表现，发现CNN+随机森林混合模型效果最佳，准确率达85.4%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发自动化牙科疾病分类系统，利用深度学习技术提高牙科X射线图像诊断的准确性和效率，为临床诊断提供可靠支持。

Method: 使用1,512张全景X射线图像和11,137个专家标注，评估三种方法：自定义CNN、CNN特征提取+传统分类器的混合模型、以及微调的预训练架构（VGG16、Xception、ResNet50），采用5折交叉验证。

Result: 混合CNN+随机森林模型表现最佳（85.4%准确率），优于自定义CNN基线（74.3%）。预训练模型中VGG16效果最好（82.3%），混合模型在形态相似病症区分方面表现更优。

Conclusion: CNN特征提取与集成分类器结合是自动化牙科诊断支持的实用途径，但需要更大数据集和进一步临床验证。

Abstract: This study investigates deep learning methods for automated classification of
dental conditions in panoramic X-ray images. A dataset of 1,512 radiographs
with 11,137 expert-verified annotations across four conditions fillings,
cavities, implants, and impacted teeth was used. After preprocessing and class
balancing, three approaches were evaluated: a custom convolutional neural
network (CNN), hybrid models combining CNN feature extraction with traditional
classifiers, and fine-tuned pre-trained architectures. Experiments employed 5
fold cross validation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as
evaluation metrics. The hybrid CNN Random Forest model achieved the highest
performance with 85.4% accuracy, surpassing the custom CNN baseline of 74.3%.
Among pre-trained models, VGG16 performed best at 82.3% accuracy, followed by
Xception and ResNet50. Results show that hybrid models improve discrimination
of morphologically similar conditions and provide efficient, reliable
performance. These findings suggest that combining CNN-based feature extraction
with ensemble classifiers offers a practical path toward automated dental
diagnostic support, while also highlighting the need for larger datasets and
further clinical validation.

### [3] [Q-Align: Alleviating Attention Leakage in Zero-Shot Appearance Transfer via Query-Query Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21090)
*Namu Kim,Wonbin Kweon,Minsoo Kim,Hwanjo Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Align通过Query-Query对齐解决大模型零样本外观迁移中的注意力泄漏问题，在保持结构的同时显著提升外观保真度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模图像生成模型在零样本外观迁移中存在注意力泄漏问题，这是由于Query-Key对齐导致的语义映射不准确

Method: 提出Q-Align方法，包含三个核心贡献：Query-Query对齐实现精细空间语义映射、Key-Value重排增强特征对应、使用重排后的Key-Value进行注意力精化

Result: 通过大量实验验证，Q-Align在外观保真度方面优于最先进方法，同时保持竞争力的结构保持能力

Conclusion: Q-Align有效解决了注意力泄漏问题，为零样本外观迁移提供了更准确的语义对齐方案

Abstract: We observe that zero-shot appearance transfer with large-scale image
generation models faces a significant challenge: Attention Leakage. This
challenge arises when the semantic mapping between two images is captured by
the Query-Key alignment. To tackle this issue, we introduce Q-Align, utilizing
Query-Query alignment to mitigate attention leakage and improve the semantic
alignment in zero-shot appearance transfer. Q-Align incorporates three core
contributions: (1) Query-Query alignment, facilitating the sophisticated
spatial semantic mapping between two images; (2) Key-Value rearrangement,
enhancing feature correspondence through realignment; and (3) Attention
refinement using rearranged keys and values to maintain semantic consistency.
We validate the effectiveness of Q-Align through extensive experiments and
analysis, and Q-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance
fidelity while maintaining competitive structure preservation.

*Andreas Leibetseder,Sabrina Kletz,Klaus Schoeffmann,Simon Keckstein,Jörg Keckstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 发布了首个妇科腹腔镜子宫内膜异位症数据集GLENDA，包含区域标注的子宫内膜异位症图像数据，用于支持计算机视觉和机器学习在手术视频分析中的应用


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 妇科腹腔镜手术视频的手动分析过程耗时且繁琐，而现有的计算机视觉方法严重依赖样本数据，但在医学领域数据稀缺，特别是缺乏专门针对子宫内膜异位症的数据集

Method: 与领先医学专家合作创建了包含区域标注的妇科腹腔镜子宫内膜异位症图像数据集GLENDA，这是该领域首个此类数据集

Result: 成功构建了GLENDA数据集，为子宫内膜异位症的计算机视觉分析提供了宝贵的标注数据资源

Conclusion: GLENDA数据集的发布将促进妇科腹腔镜手术视频分析的自动化方法发展，支持治疗规划、病例记录和教育等术后活动

Abstract: Gynecologic laparoscopy as a type of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is
performed via a live feed of a patient's abdomen surveying the insertion and
handling of various instruments for conducting treatment. Adopting this kind of
surgical intervention not only facilitates a great variety of treatments, the
possibility of recording said video streams is as well essential for numerous
post-surgical activities, such as treatment planning, case documentation and
education. Nonetheless, the process of manually analyzing surgical recordings,
as it is carried out in current practice, usually proves tediously
time-consuming. In order to improve upon this situation, more sophisticated
computer vision as well as machine learning approaches are actively developed.
Since most of such approaches heavily rely on sample data, which especially in
the medical field is only sparsely available, with this work we publish the
Gynecologic Laparoscopy ENdometriosis DAtaset (GLENDA) - an image dataset
containing region-based annotations of a common medical condition named
endometriosis, i.e. the dislocation of uterine-like tissue. The dataset is the
first of its kind and it has been created in collaboration with leading medical
experts in the field.

### [5] [ERTACache: Error Rectification and Timesteps Adjustment for Efficient Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21091)
*Xurui Peng,Hong Liu,Chenqian Yan,Rui Ma,Fangmin Chen,Xing Wang,Zhihua Wu,Songwei Liu,Mingbao Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERTACache是一个针对扩散模型的缓存加速框架，通过分析缓存累积误差的两个主要来源（特征偏移误差和步长放大误差），采用离线残差分析、轨迹感知校正和闭式残差线性化等方法，在保持视觉质量的同时实现2倍推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型由于迭代推理过程导致计算开销巨大，特征缓存虽然是有前景的加速策略，但简单的重用会导致明显的质量下降。需要解决缓存引入的累积误差问题。

Method: 提出ERTACache框架：1）离线残差分析识别可重用步骤；2）通过轨迹感知校正系数动态调整积分间隔；3）使用闭式残差线性化模型分析近似缓存引起的误差。

Result: 在标准图像和视频生成基准测试中，ERTACache实现了高达2倍的推理加速，同时保持甚至改善了视觉质量。在Wan2.1视频扩散模型上，2倍加速的同时VBench退化最小。

Conclusion: ERTACache通过系统性地解决缓存误差问题，在显著提高扩散模型推理效率的同时保持了生成质量，为扩散模型的实用化部署提供了有效的加速方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models suffer from substantial computational overhead due to their
inherently iterative inference process. While feature caching offers a
promising acceleration strategy by reusing intermediate outputs across
timesteps, naive reuse often incurs noticeable quality degradation. In this
work, we formally analyze the cumulative error introduced by caching and
decompose it into two principal components: feature shift error, caused by
inaccuracies in cached outputs, and step amplification error, which arises from
error propagation under fixed timestep schedules. To address these issues, we
propose ERTACache, a principled caching framework that jointly rectifies both
error types. Our method employs an offline residual profiling stage to identify
reusable steps, dynamically adjusts integration intervals via a
trajectory-aware correction coefficient, and analytically approximates
cache-induced errors through a closed-form residual linearization model.
Together, these components enable accurate and efficient sampling under
aggressive cache reuse. Extensive experiments across standard image and video
generation benchmarks show that ERTACache achieves up to 2x inference speedup
while consistently preserving or even improving visual quality. Notably, on the
state-of-the-art Wan2.1 video diffusion model, ERTACache delivers 2x
acceleration with minimal VBench degradation, effectively maintaining baseline
fidelity while significantly improving efficiency. The code is available at
https://github.com/bytedance/ERTACache.

### [6] [Identifying Surgical Instruments in Laparoscopy Using Deep Learning Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21399)
*Sabrina Kletz,Klaus Schoeffmann,Jenny Benois-Pineau,Heinrich Husslein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究使用区域全卷积网络进行腹腔镜妇科手术视频中手术器械的实例分割和识别，实现了高精度的器械定位和分割，但器械类型识别仍具挑战性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术视频记录已成为医学内窥镜领域的重要信息来源，但自动内容索引（基于内容的医学视频档案搜索的基础）由于视频内容的特殊性仍然是一个巨大挑战

Method: 使用区域全卷积网络进行实例感知的(1)器械分割和(2)器械识别。第一部分处理二值实例分割（区分器械或背景），第二部分研究多类别器械识别（识别器械类型）

Result: 即使训练样本数量较少，也能以相当高的精度定位和分割器械区域。但确定特定器械类型仍然非常具有挑战性

Conclusion: 手术器械分割取得了良好效果，但由于手术器械固有的高度相似性，器械类型识别仍然是需要进一步研究的重要挑战

Abstract: Recorded videos from surgeries have become an increasingly important
information source for the field of medical endoscopy, since the recorded
footage shows every single detail of the surgery. However, while video
recording is straightforward these days, automatic content indexing - the basis
for content-based search in a medical video archive - is still a great
challenge due to the very special video content. In this work, we investigate
segmentation and recognition of surgical instruments in videos recorded from
laparoscopic gynecology. More precisely, we evaluate the achievable performance
of segmenting surgical instruments from their background by using a
region-based fully convolutional network for instance-aware (1) instrument
segmentation as well as (2) instrument recognition. While the first part
addresses only binary segmentation of instances (i.e., distinguishing between
instrument or background) we also investigate multi-class instrument
recognition (i.e., identifying the type of instrument). Our evaluation results
show that even with a moderately low number of training examples, we are able
to localize and segment instrument regions with a pretty high accuracy.
However, the results also reveal that determining the particular instrument is
still very challenging, due to the inherently high similarity of surgical
instruments.

### [7] [Video-LLMs with Temporal Visual Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21094)
*Zheyu Fan,Jiateng Liu,Yuji Zhang,Zihan Wang,Yi R.,Fung,Manling Li,Heng Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了时间视觉筛选(TVS)方法，通过保留关键视频段落和重构查询，解决视频大语言模型在细粒度时间语义理解上的挑战，在训练和推理阶段都取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类自然地通过拖动进度条进行时间筛选，但当前的视频大语言模型因为帧采样稀疏和训练中缺乏足够的帧间推理监督，无法抓取细粒度的时间语义。

Method: 提出时间视觉筛选(TVS)任务，包括：(1)保留重点关键视频段落，(2)同步重构查询到最直接形式保持答案一致性，(3)保持答案的不变性和一致性。TVS是一个模块化的前端适配器任务，可无缝集成到视频指令循环和视频问答管道中。

Result: 建立了首个TVS基准，提出的ReSimplifyIt基线在视频剪辑任务上比之前方法提升0.47的F-1分数，并在查询重写任务上达到竞争性能。实验显示集成TVS在训练阶段获得7.33%相对提升，在推理阶段获得34.6%相对提升。

Conclusion: TVS通过优化推理负担和认知负荷的分配，在训练时对齐查询与重点视觉信息，在推理时支持查询感知段落聚焦和流线型查询表示，显示了时间信息筛选对改善视频-语言理解的有效性。

Abstract: Humans naturally perform temporal screening by dragging the progress bar and
focusing on salient temporal segments, but current Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs) struggle to capture fine-grained temporal semantics due to sparse
frame sampling and insufficient inter-frame reasoning supervision during their
training. To address this, Inspired by well-established cognitive science
principles, we propose Temporal Visual Screening (TVS), a new task that
universally pre-processes video question answering and instruction tuning data
by: (1) retaining focus-critical video segments, (2) synchronously
reconstructing queries to their most direct form while preserving answer
consistency, and (3) keeping the invariance and consistency for any possible
answer. TVS is formulated as a modular front-end adapter task that can be
seamlessly integrated into both Video Instruction Tuning (training) and Video
Question Answering (inference) pipelines. TVS optimizes distribution of
reasoning burden and cognitive load; during training, it aligns queries with
focus-critical visual information; at inference, it enables query-aware segment
focus and streamlined query representations. In particular, we curate the first
benchmark for TVS and propose ReSimplifyIt, a baseline outperforming prior
approaches on seemingly similar tasks by 0.47 in F-1 score on video trimming
while achieving competitive query rewriting performance. Experiments
demonstrate that incorporating TVS yields relative gains of 7.33% (training)
and 34.6% (inference), demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal information
screening for improving video-language understanding.

### [8] [Learning from Silence and Noise for Visual Sound Source Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21761)
*Xavier Juanola,Giovana Morais,Magdalena Fuentes,Gloria Haro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的自监督视觉声源定位方法SSL-SaN，通过引入静音和噪声训练策略，提高了在正负音频情况下的性能，并提出了新的评估指标和数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉声源定位方法在低音频-视觉语义对应情况下（如静音、噪声、屏幕外声音）表现不佳，且现有评估主要局限于单一可见声源的正向场景。

Method: 提出了包含静音和噪声的新训练策略，开发了自监督模型SSL-SaN，设计了新的评估指标来衡量正负音频-视觉对的特征对齐和分离性，并扩展了IS3+合成数据集。

Result: SSL-SaN模型在声源定位和跨模态检索方面达到了最先进的性能，在正向情况下表现更好，同时对负向声音更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过处理负向音频情况显著提升了视觉声源定位的性能，为更真实的场景应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual sound source localization is a fundamental perception task that aims
to detect the location of sounding sources in a video given its audio. Despite
recent progress, we identify two shortcomings in current methods: 1) most
approaches perform poorly in cases with low audio-visual semantic
correspondence such as silence, noise, and offscreen sounds, i.e. in the
presence of negative audio; and 2) most prior evaluations are limited to
positive cases, where both datasets and metrics convey scenarios with a single
visible sound source in the scene. To address this, we introduce three key
contributions. First, we propose a new training strategy that incorporates
silence and noise, which improves performance in positive cases, while being
more robust against negative sounds. Our resulting self-supervised model,
SSL-SaN, achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other
self-supervised models, both in sound localization and cross-modal retrieval.
Second, we propose a new metric that quantifies the trade-off between alignment
and separability of auditory and visual features across positive and negative
audio-visual pairs. Third, we present IS3+, an extended and improved version of
the IS3 synthetic dataset with negative audio.
  Our data, metrics and code are available on the

### [9] [ROBUST-MIPS: A Combined Skeletal Pose and Instance Segmentation Dataset for Laparoscopic Surgical Instruments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21096)
*Zhe Han,Charlie Budd,Gongyu Zhang,Huanyu Tian,Christos Bergeles,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用骨骼姿态标注作为手术工具定位的更高效标注方法，并基于ROBUST-MIS数据集创建了ROBUST-MIPS数据集，包含工具姿态和实例分割标注，通过基准测试验证了姿态标注的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的手术工具定位方法受限于标注数据的多样性，作者认为骨骼姿态标注在语义信息丰富度和标注效率之间达到了更好平衡，能够加速标注数据的增长。

Method: 基于现有ROBUST-MIS数据集创建了ROBUST-MIPS数据集，包含工具姿态和实例分割两种标注方式；使用流行的姿态估计方法建立简单基准测试来验证姿态标注的适用性。

Result: 观察到高质量的姿态估计结果，证明了姿态标注对于手术工具定位的充分性。

Conclusion: 骨骼姿态标注是手术工具定位的有效方法，新发布的数据集和标注软件将促进该标注方式的采用，推动计算机辅助介入技术的发展。

Abstract: Localisation of surgical tools constitutes a foundational building block for
computer-assisted interventional technologies. Works in this field typically
focus on training deep learning models to perform segmentation tasks.
Performance of learning-based approaches is limited by the availability of
diverse annotated data. We argue that skeletal pose annotations are a more
efficient annotation approach for surgical tools, striking a balance between
richness of semantic information and ease of annotation, thus allowing for
accelerated growth of available annotated data. To encourage adoption of this
annotation style, we present, ROBUST-MIPS, a combined tool pose and tool
instance segmentation dataset derived from the existing ROBUST-MIS dataset. Our
enriched dataset facilitates the joint study of these two annotation styles and
allow head-to-head comparison on various downstream tasks. To demonstrate the
adequacy of pose annotations for surgical tool localisation, we set up a simple
benchmark using popular pose estimation methods and observe high-quality
results. To ease adoption, together with the dataset, we release our benchmark
models and custom tool pose annotation software.

### [10] [Safe-Control: A Safety Patch for Mitigating Unsafe Content in Text-to-Image Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21099)
*Xiangtao Meng,Yingkai Dong,Ning Yu,Li Wang,Zheng Li,Shanqing Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Safe-Control是一个即插即用的安全补丁，用于减少文本到图像生成模型中的不安全内容生成，通过数据驱动策略和安全感知条件向锁定模型注入安全控制信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成模型安全机制容易受到分布偏移的规避攻击，或需要大量模型特定调整，需要一种更有效和灵活的解决方案。

Method: 使用数据驱动策略和安全感知条件，以补丁方式向锁定的T2I模型注入安全控制信号，支持构建多种安全补丁并灵活合并。

Result: 在六个不同的T2I模型上评估显示，Safe-Control将不安全内容生成概率降至7%，显著优于其他七种最先进的安全机制（约20%），同时保持良性图像质量和文本对齐。

Conclusion: Safe-Control作为一种即插即用的安全补丁，能有效减少T2I模型的不安全内容生成，具有出色的适应性和兼容性，优于现有安全机制。

Abstract: Despite the advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their
potential for misuse or even abuse raises serious safety concerns. Model
developers have made tremendous efforts to introduce safety mechanisms that can
address these concerns in T2I models. However, the existing safety mechanisms,
whether external or internal, either remain susceptible to evasion under
distribution shifts or require extensive model-specific adjustments. To address
these limitations, we introduce Safe-Control, an innovative plug-and-play
safety patch designed to mitigate unsafe content generation in T2I models.
Using data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions, Safe-Control injects
safety control signals into the locked T2I model, acting as an update in a
patch-like manner. Model developers can also construct various safety patches
to meet the evolving safety requirements, which can be flexibly merged into a
single, unified patch. Its plug-and-play design further ensures adaptability,
making it compatible with other T2I models of similar denoising architecture.
We conduct extensive evaluations on six diverse and public T2I models.
Empirical results highlight that Safe-Control is effective in reducing unsafe
content generation across six diverse T2I models with similar generative
architectures, yet it successfully maintains the quality and text alignment of
benign images. Compared to seven state-of-the-art safety mechanisms, including
both external and internal defenses, Safe-Control significantly outperforms all
baselines in reducing unsafe content generation. For example, it reduces the
probability of unsafe content generation to 7%, compared to approximately 20%
for most baseline methods, under both unsafe prompts and the latest adversarial
attacks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GENNAV是一个能够从自然语言指令和前置摄像头图像中识别目标区域位置的新方法，特别擅长处理边界模糊的stuff-type目标区域，并在多目标和无目标情况下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理stuff-type目标区域（边界模糊）以及无目标或多目标情况时表现不佳，需要一种能够同时预测目标存在性和生成分割掩码的解决方案。

Method: 提出GENNAV方法，能够预测目标存在性并为多个stuff-type目标区域生成分割掩码。构建了GRiN-Drive基准数据集，包含无目标、单目标和多目标三种样本类型。

Result: GENNAV在标准评估指标上优于基线方法，并在四个汽车、五个不同地理区域的真实世界实验中展示了优异的零样本迁移性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GENNAV方法在处理复杂目标区域识别任务方面表现出色，特别是在真实世界环境中具有很好的泛化能力和实用性。

Abstract: We focus on the task of identifying the location of target regions from a
natural language instruction and a front camera image captured by a mobility.
This task is challenging because it requires both existence prediction and
segmentation, particularly for stuff-type target regions with ambiguous
boundaries. Existing methods often underperform in handling stuff-type target
regions, in addition to absent or multiple targets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GENNAV, which predicts target existence and generates
segmentation masks for multiple stuff-type target regions. To evaluate GENNAV,
we constructed a novel benchmark called GRiN-Drive, which includes three
distinct types of samples: no-target, single-target, and multi-target. GENNAV
achieved superior performance over baseline methods on standard evaluation
metrics. Furthermore, we conducted real-world experiments with four automobiles
operated in five geographically distinct urban areas to validate its zero-shot
transfer performance. In these experiments, GENNAV outperformed baseline
methods and demonstrated its robustness across diverse real-world environments.

### [12] [R-4B: Incentivizing General-Purpose Auto-Thinking Capability in MLLMs via Bi-Mode Annealing and Reinforce Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21113)
*Jie Jiang,Qi Yang,Bolin Ni,Shiming Xiang,Han Hu,Houwen Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: R-4B是一个自适应思考的多模态大语言模型，能够根据问题复杂度自动决定是否启用思考过程，在保持高性能的同时降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在处理简单问题时也会进行冗余的逐步思考过程，导致计算效率低下。需要一种能够自适应决定是否思考的模型来提高效率。

Method: 采用双模式退火训练方法，让模型同时具备思考和非思考能力，并通过双模式策略优化(BPO)提高模型判断是否激活思考过程的准确性。训练分为两个阶段：首先在精心策划的数据集上训练，然后在改进的GRPO框架下进行策略优化。

Result: R-4B在25个具有挑战性的基准测试中达到最先进性能，在大多数任务上超越Qwen2.5-VL-7B，在推理密集型基准上与更大的16B模型性能相当但计算成本更低。

Conclusion: R-4B通过自适应思考机制成功解决了多模态大语言模型在处理简单问题时的计算效率问题，实现了高性能与低计算成本的平衡。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) equipped with step-by-step thinking
capabilities have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning
problems. However, this thinking process is redundant for simple problems
solvable without complex reasoning. To address this inefficiency, we propose
R-4B, an auto-thinking MLLM, which can adaptively decide when to think based on
problem complexity. The central idea of R-4B is to empower the model with both
thinking and non-thinking capabilities using bi-mode annealing, and apply
Bi-mode Policy Optimization~(BPO) to improve the model's accuracy in
determining whether to activate the thinking process. Specifically, we first
train the model on a carefully curated dataset spanning various topics, which
contains samples from both thinking and non-thinking modes. Then it undergoes a
second phase of training under an improved GRPO framework, where the policy
model is forced to generate responses from both modes for each input query.
Experimental results show that R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance
across 25 challenging benchmarks. It outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks
and achieves performance comparable to larger models such as
Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) on reasoning-intensive benchmarks with lower
computational cost.

*Harris Song,Tuan-Anh Vu,Sanjith Menon,Sriram Narasimhan,M. Khalid Jawed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiddenObject是一个基于Mamba的多模态融合框架，整合RGB、热成像和深度数据，用于检测遮挡或伪装目标，在多个基准数据集上达到先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RGB检测方法在遮挡、伪装和光照变化等恶劣条件下性能受限，需要更鲁棒的多模态方法来应对这些挑战。

Method: 提出Mamba-based融合机制，整合RGB、热成像和深度数据，识别模态特定特征并在统一表示中进行融合。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上验证，相比现有方法达到state-of-the-art或竞争性性能，证明了融合设计的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于Mamba的融合架构能显著推进多模态目标检测领域发展，特别是在视觉退化或复杂条件下表现优异。

Abstract: Detecting hidden or partially concealed objects remains a fundamental
challenge in multimodal environments, where factors like occlusion, camouflage,
and lighting variations significantly hinder performance. Traditional RGB-based
detection methods often fail under such adverse conditions, motivating the need
for more robust, modality-agnostic approaches. In this work, we present
HiddenObject, a fusion framework that integrates RGB, thermal, and depth data
using a Mamba-based fusion mechanism. Our method captures complementary signals
across modalities, enabling enhanced detection of obscured or camouflaged
targets. Specifically, the proposed approach identifies modality-specific
features and fuses them in a unified representation that generalizes well
across challenging scenarios. We validate HiddenObject across multiple

TL;DR: RadGS-Reg是一个新颖的CT/X射线配准框架，通过联合3D辐射高斯重建和3D/3D配准来解决传统方法的局限性，在噪声X射线下实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统"渲染和比较"方法存在空间信息丢失和域差距问题，而现有的双平面X射线3D重建方法受限于密集视图要求和噪声处理困难。

Method: 提出RadGS-Reg框架，包含基于学习的辐射高斯重建模块和反事实注意力学习机制，采用患者特定的预训练策略从模拟数据逐步适应到真实数据。

Result: 在内部数据集上的实验表明，该方法在两个任务上都达到了最先进的性能，超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: RadGS-Reg通过联合重建和配准的方法，有效解决了CT/X射线配准中的准确性和实时性挑战，特别是在噪声环境下表现出色。

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT)/X-ray registration in image-guided navigation
remains challenging because of its stringent requirements for high accuracy and
real-time performance. Traditional "render and compare" methods, relying on
iterative projection and comparison, suffer from spatial information loss and
domain gap. 3D reconstruction from biplanar X-rays supplements spatial and
shape information for 2D/3D registration, but current methods are limited by
dense-view requirements and struggles with noisy X-rays. To address these
limitations, we introduce RadGS-Reg, a novel framework for vertebral-level
CT/X-ray registration through joint 3D Radiative Gaussians (RadGS)
reconstruction and 3D/3D registration. Specifically, our biplanar X-rays
vertebral RadGS reconstruction module explores learning-based RadGS
reconstruction method with a Counterfactual Attention Learning (CAL) mechanism,
focusing on vertebral regions in noisy X-rays. Additionally, a patient-specific
pre-training strategy progressively adapts the RadGS-Reg from simulated to real
data while simultaneously learning vertebral shape prior knowledge. Experiments
on in-house datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance for both
tasks, surpassing existing methods. The code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏大规模标注的3D建筑数据集，自动生成准确且语义丰富的3D建筑模型面临重大挑战，这限制了在建筑、能源模拟和导航等领域的应用发展。

Method: 通过合成数据方法创建包含620万个3D住宅建筑的数据集，每个建筑提供三种模态表示：LoD 4语义3D线框图、对应平面图图像和LiDAR式屋顶点云。

Result: 成功构建了SYNBUILD-3D数据集，包含丰富的语义注释（房间、门窗信息），支持多模态生成算法的开发，数据集和代码已公开。

Conclusion: SYNBUILD-3D为开发新型生成式AI算法提供了重要基础，能够自动化创建语义几何一致的LoD 4级别3D建筑模型，推动相关领域研究发展。

Abstract: 3D building models are critical for applications in architecture, energy
simulation, and navigation. Yet, generating accurate and semantically rich 3D
buildings automatically remains a major challenge due to the lack of
large-scale annotated datasets in the public domain. Inspired by the success of
synthetic data in computer vision, we introduce SYNBUILD-3D, a large, diverse,
and multi-modal dataset of over 6.2 million synthetic 3D residential buildings
at Level of Detail (LoD) 4. In the dataset, each building is represented
through three distinct modalities: a semantically enriched 3D wireframe graph
at LoD 4 (Modality I), the corresponding floor plan images (Modality II), and a
LiDAR-like roof point cloud (Modality III). The semantic annotations for each
building wireframe are derived from the corresponding floor plan images and
include information on rooms, doors, and windows. Through its tri-modal nature,
future work can use SYNBUILD-3D to develop novel generative AI algorithms that
automate the creation of 3D building models at LoD 4, subject to predefined
floor plan layouts and roof geometries, while enforcing semantic-geometric
consistency. Dataset and code samples are publicly available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的方法来同时估计单应性变换和径向畸变，解决了三种不同配置下的径向畸变问题，并开发了快速、稳定、准确的最小求解器。


<details>

Motivation: 在真实图像处理中，相机镜头引起的几何畸变（特别是径向畸变）会影响单应性估计的准确性。传统方法分别处理三种不同的径向畸变配置，缺乏统一的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的统一方法，能够同时处理三种径向畸变配置：单图像畸变、两图像相同畸变和两图像独立畸变。基于该方法构建了新的最小求解器。

Result: 在所有三种情况下，提出的求解器都比现有最先进方法更快，同时保持相似的准确性。在包括鱼眼相机图像在内的标准基准测试中表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法为径向畸变单应性估计提供了一个统一的框架，开发的求解器在速度和准确性方面都有显著优势，适用于各种计算机视觉任务。

Abstract: Homographies are among the most prevalent transformations occurring in
geometric computer vision and projective geometry, and homography estimation is
consequently a crucial step in a wide assortment of computer vision tasks. When
working with real images, which are often afflicted with geometric distortions
caused by the camera lens, it may be necessary to determine both the homography
and the lens distortion-particularly the radial component, called radial
distortion-simultaneously to obtain anything resembling useful estimates. When
considering a homography with radial distortion between two images, there are
three conceptually distinct configurations for the radial distortion; (i)
distortion in only one image, (ii) identical distortion in the two images, and
(iii) independent distortion in the two images. While these cases have been
addressed separately in the past, the present paper provides a novel and
unified approach to solve all three cases. We demonstrate how the proposed
approach can be used to construct new fast, stable, and accurate minimal
solvers for radially distorted homographies. In all three cases, our proposed
solvers are faster than the existing state-of-the-art solvers while maintaining
similar accuracy. The solvers are tested on well-established benchmarks
including images taken with fisheye cameras. The source code for our solvers
will be made available in the event our paper is accepted for publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了全局概念激活向量(GCAV)框架，通过对比学习和注意力融合机制统一不同层的CAV表示，解决了跨层概念不一致问题，提高了概念归因的稳定性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决独立计算的不同层CAV存在不一致性，导致跨层比较不可靠的问题，需要统一的语义一致表示。

Method: 使用对比学习对齐跨层概念表示，采用基于注意力的融合机制构建全局集成CAV，并提出了TGCAV测试方法。

Result: 显著降低了TCAV分数的方差，保持了概念相关性，有效缓解了跨层概念不一致性，增强了概念定位能力，提高了对抗扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GCAV框架通过整合跨层信息，提供了更全面和可解释的深度学习模型概念编码理解方式。

Abstract: Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) provide a powerful approach for
interpreting deep neural networks by quantifying their sensitivity to
human-defined concepts. However, when computed independently at different
layers, CAVs often exhibit inconsistencies, making cross-layer comparisons
unreliable. To address this issue, we propose the Global Concept Activation
Vector (GCAV), a novel framework that unifies CAVs into a single, semantically
consistent representation. Our method leverages contrastive learning to align
concept representations across layers and employs an attention-based fusion
mechanism to construct a globally integrated CAV. By doing so, our method
significantly reduces the variance in TCAV scores while preserving concept
relevance, ensuring more stable and reliable concept attributions. To evaluate
the effectiveness of GCAV, we introduce Testing with Global Concept Activation
Vectors (TGCAV) as a method to apply TCAV to GCAV-based representations. We
conduct extensive experiments on multiple deep neural networks, demonstrating
that our method effectively mitigates concept inconsistency across layers,
enhances concept localization, and improves robustness against adversarial
perturbations. By integrating cross-layer information into a coherent
framework, our method offers a more comprehensive and interpretable
understanding of how deep learning models encode human-defined concepts. Code
and models are available at https://github.com/Zhenghao-He/GCAV.

*Zhizhong Huang,Xiaoming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VICP是一个无需参数调整的视觉上下文提示框架，通过结合LLM和视觉基础模型，使模型能够在仅使用上下文示例的情况下直接泛化到未见过的物体类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前物体重识别方法需要为每个特定领域训练模型，缺乏泛化能力且需要大量标注数据。自监督学习虽然减少标注需求，但难以捕捉对重识别至关重要的身份敏感特征。

Method: VICP框架利用LLM从少量正负样本对中推断语义身份规则，通过任务特定的提示指导视觉基础模型（如DINO）提取身份判别特征。通过动态视觉提示将LLM推导的语义概念与VFM的预训练先验对齐。

Result: 在ShopID10K数据集和多个重识别基准测试中，VICP在未见类别上明显优于基线方法，展示了强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: VICP通过视觉上下文提示实现了对未见物体类别的零样本泛化，无需数据集特定的重新训练，为物体重识别提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Current object re-identification (ReID) methods train domain-specific models
(e.g., for persons or vehicles), which lack generalization and demand costly
labeled data for new categories. While self-supervised learning reduces
annotation needs by learning instance-wise invariance, it struggles to capture
\textit{identity-sensitive} features critical for ReID. This paper proposes
Visual In-Context Prompting~(VICP), a novel framework where models trained on
seen categories can directly generalize to unseen novel categories using only
\textit{in-context examples} as prompts, without requiring parameter
adaptation. VICP synergizes LLMs and vision foundation models~(VFM): LLMs infer
semantic identity rules from few-shot positive/negative pairs through
task-specific prompting, which then guides a VFM (\eg, DINO) to extract
ID-discriminative features via \textit{dynamic visual prompts}. By aligning
LLM-derived semantic concepts with the VFM's pre-trained prior, VICP enables
generalization to novel categories, eliminating the need for dataset-specific
retraining. To support evaluation, we introduce ShopID10K, a dataset of 10K
object instances from e-commerce platforms, featuring multi-view images and
cross-domain testing. Experiments on ShopID10K and diverse ReID benchmarks
demonstrate that VICP outperforms baselines by a clear margin on unseen
categories. Code is available at https://github.com/Hzzone/VICP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究使用SegResNet模型在Auto3DSeg架构下，针对MRI胰腺肿瘤分割任务进行训练评估。在PANTHER挑战赛的两个任务中，Task 1（T1加权动脉期增强MRI）获得DSC 0.56，Task 2（T2加权MR-Linac）性能下降至DSC 0.33，凸显了小数据集下MRI序列差异带来的分割挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺肿瘤的精确分割对诊断、治疗规划和预后评估至关重要，但由于解剖结构变异性和数据集有限，自动化分割仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 采用SegResNet模型作为Auto3DSeg架构的一部分，使用5折交叉验证和STAPLE集成方法，在解剖相关感兴趣区域进行训练。Task 1使用91例T1加权动脉期增强MRI，Task 2使用50例T2加权MR-Linac病例。

Result: Task 1：DSC 0.56，5 mm DSC 0.73，HD95 41.1 mm，MASD 26.0 mm，RMSE 5164 mm；Task 2：DSC 0.33，5 mm DSC 0.50，HD95 20.1 mm，MASD 7.2 mm，RMSE 17203 mm。Task 2性能明显下降。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明小数据集下MRI胰腺肿瘤分割的挑战性，不同MRI序列会引入显著变异性。尽管性能一般，但展示了自动化分割的潜力，强调需要更大、标准化的MRI数据集来提高模型鲁棒性和临床实用性。

Abstract: Accurate delineation of pancreatic tumors is critical for diagnosis,
treatment planning, and outcome assessment, yet automated segmentation remains
challenging due to anatomical variability and limited dataset availability. In
this study, SegResNet models, as part of the Auto3DSeg architecture, were
trained and evaluated on two MRI-based pancreatic tumor segmentation tasks as
part of the 2025 PANTHER Challenge. Algorithm methodology included 5-fold
cross-validation with STAPLE ensembling after focusing on an anatomically
relevant region-of-interest. The Pancreatic Tumor Segmentation on Diagnostic
MRI task 1 training set included 91 T1-weighted arterial contrast-enhanced MRI
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. The Pancreatic Tumor
Segmentation on MR-Linac task 2 training set used 50 T2-weighted MR-Linac cases
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. Algorithm-automated
segmentation performance of pancreatic tumor was assessed using Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC), 5 mm DSC, 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95), Mean
Average Surface Distance (MASD), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). For Task 1,
the algorithm achieved a DSC of 0.56, 5 mm DSC of 0.73, HD95 of 41.1 mm, MASD
of 26.0 mm, and RMSE of 5164 mm. For Task 2, performance decreased, with a DSC
of 0.33, 5 mm DSC of 0.50, HD95 of 20.1 mm, MASD of 7.2 mm, and RMSE of 17,203
mm. These findings illustrate the challenges of MRI-based pancreatic tumor
segmentation with small datasets, highlighting variability introduced by
different MRI sequences. Despite modest performance, the results demonstrate
potential for automated delineation and emphasize the need for larger,
standardized MRI datasets to improve model robustness and clinical utility.

*Yidong Zhao,Peter Kellman,Hui Xue,Tongyun Yang,Yi Zhang,Yuchi Han,Orlando Simonetti,Qian Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reverse Imaging是一种基于物理原理的心脏MRI数据增强方法，通过反演推断底层自旋属性来解决不同成像序列间的泛化问题，显著提升分割模型的跨域性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的心脏MRI分割模型难以泛化到不同成像序列，因为图像对比度差异巨大。虽然成像协议不同，但所有图像都由相同的自旋属性（质子密度、T1、T2值）决定。

Method: 提出Reverse Imaging方法：1）从观测图像反演推断底层自旋属性，解决非线性逆问题；2）使用扩散模型学习自旋属性的先验分布；3）基于估计的自旋属性合成任意新序列的图像。

Result: 该方法能够从MR图像获得有意义的自旋属性估计，作为可解释的潜在变量，实现高度灵活的图像合成，使分割模型在不同图像对比度和成像协议下都能达到高精度。

Conclusion: Reverse Imaging通过物理驱动的数据增强方法，从根本上解决了心脏MRI分割的泛化问题，实现了宽谱泛化能力。

Abstract: Pretrained segmentation models for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
struggle to generalize across different imaging sequences due to significant
variations in image contrast. These variations arise from changes in imaging
protocols, yet the same fundamental spin properties, including proton density,
T1, and T2 values, govern all acquired images. With this core principle, we
introduce Reverse Imaging, a novel physics-driven method for cardiac MRI data
augmentation and domain adaptation to fundamentally solve the generalization
problem. Our method reversely infers the underlying spin properties from
observed cardiac MRI images, by solving ill-posed nonlinear inverse problems
regularized by the prior distribution of spin properties. We acquire this "spin
prior" by learning a generative diffusion model from the multiparametric
SAturation-recovery single-SHot acquisition sequence (mSASHA) dataset, which
offers joint cardiac T1 and T2 maps. Our method enables approximate but
meaningful spin-property estimates from MR images, which provide an
interpretable "latent variable" that lead to highly flexible image synthesis of
arbitrary novel sequences. We show that Reverse Imaging enables highly accurate
segmentation across vastly different image contrasts and imaging protocols,
realizing wide-spectrum generalization of cardiac MRI segmentation.

TL;DR: PHD是一种新颖的个性化3D人体网格恢复方法，通过用户特定形状信息提高视频姿态估计精度，使用点扩散变换器作为形状条件3D姿态先验，可无缝集成到现有3D姿态估计器中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HMR方法为通用化设计，依赖2D约束优化姿态但会牺牲3D精度，无法同时考虑个性化身体形状和3D姿态合理性。

Method: 首先校准用户身体形状，然后基于该形状进行个性化姿态拟合，使用点扩散变换器实现形状条件3D姿态先验，通过点蒸馏采样损失迭代引导姿态拟合。

Result: 不仅提高了骨盆对齐姿态精度，还改善了绝对姿态精度，仅需合成数据训练，可作为即插即用模块提升现有3D姿态估计器性能。

Conclusion: PHD方法通过解耦形状校准和姿态拟合过程，有效减少对2D约束的过度依赖，在数据效率和性能提升方面表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce PHD, a novel approach for personalized 3D human mesh recovery
(HMR) and body fitting that leverages user-specific shape information to
improve pose estimation accuracy from videos. Traditional HMR methods are
designed to be user-agnostic and optimized for generalization. While these
methods often refine poses using constraints derived from the 2D image to
improve alignment, this process compromises 3D accuracy by failing to jointly
account for person-specific body shapes and the plausibility of 3D poses. In
contrast, our pipeline decouples this process by first calibrating the user's
body shape and then employing a personalized pose fitting process conditioned
on that shape. To achieve this, we develop a body shape-conditioned 3D pose
prior, implemented as a Point Diffusion Transformer, which iteratively guides
the pose fitting via a Point Distillation Sampling loss. This learned 3D pose
prior effectively mitigates errors arising from an over-reliance on 2D
constraints. Consequently, our approach improves not only pelvis-aligned pose
accuracy but also absolute pose accuracy -- an important metric often
overlooked by prior work. Furthermore, our method is highly data-efficient,
requiring only synthetic data for training, and serves as a versatile
plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with existing 3D pose
estimators to enhance their performance. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 渗透模型在生成高保真度3D人体姿势方面表现强劲，但其迭代性质和多假设要求导致计算成本较高，需要提高效率。

Method: 提出层次时序剪枝(HTP)策略：1)时间相关增强剪枝(TCEP)通过适配时间图构建识别关键帧；2)稀疏聚焦时间MHSA(SFT MHSA)利用帧级稀疏性减少注意力计算；3)面具导向姿势标记剪枝(MGPTP)通过聚类保留最信息富雅的姿势标记。

Conclusion: 该案案通过动态剪枝冗余姿势标记的方式，在保持渗透模型高性能的同时大幅提升了效率，为高效计算的3D人体姿估计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating
high-fidelity 3D human poses, yet their iterative nature and multi-hypothesis
requirements incur substantial computational cost. In this paper, we propose an
Efficient Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation framework with a
Hierarchical Temporal Pruning (HTP) strategy, which dynamically prunes
redundant pose tokens across both frame and semantic levels while preserving
critical motion dynamics. HTP operates in a staged, top-down manner: (1)
Temporal Correlation-Enhanced Pruning (TCEP) identifies essential frames by
analyzing inter-frame motion correlations through adaptive temporal graph
construction; (2) Sparse-Focused Temporal MHSA (SFT MHSA) leverages the
resulting frame-level sparsity to reduce attention computation, focusing on
motion-relevant tokens; and (3) Mask-Guided Pose Token Pruner (MGPTP) performs
fine-grained semantic pruning via clustering, retaining only the most
informative pose tokens. Experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that
HTP reduces training MACs by 38.5\%, inference MACs by 56.8\%, and improves
inference speed by an average of 81.1\% compared to prior diffusion-based
methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: Print2Volume是一个从2D指纹图像生成逼真合成OCT 3D指纹的框架，通过生成大规模合成数据集解决了OCT数据稀缺问题，显著提升了指纹识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OCT技术能获取高分辨率3D指纹数据，但数据采集成本高、耗时长，导致大规模公开数据集稀缺，阻碍了特别是深度学习算法的发展。

Method: 框架包含三个阶段：1）2D风格转换模块将二值指纹转为灰度图像；2）3D结构扩展网络将2D图像外推为3D解剖体积；3）基于3D GAN的OCT真实感细化器添加纹理和噪声特征。

Result: 生成了42万个合成样本的大规模数据集，通过在合成数据上预训练并在小规模真实数据上微调，将ZJUT-EIFD基准的等错误率从15.62%显著降低到2.50%。

Conclusion: Print2Volume框架有效解决了OCT指纹数据稀缺问题，生成的合成数据质量高，能显著提升指纹识别性能，证明了该方法在克服数据稀缺方面的有效性。

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables the acquisition of
high-resolution, three-dimensional fingerprint data, capturing rich subsurface
structures for robust biometric recognition. However, the high cost and
time-consuming nature of OCT data acquisition have led to a scarcity of
large-scale public datasets, significantly hindering the development of
advanced algorithms, particularly data-hungry deep learning models. To address
this critical bottleneck, this paper introduces Print2Volume, a novel framework
for generating realistic, synthetic OCT-based 3D fingerprints from 2D
fingerprint image. Our framework operates in three sequential stages: (1) a 2D
style transfer module that converts a binary fingerprint into a grayscale
images mimicking the style of a Z-direction mean-projected OCT scan; (2) a 3D
Structure Expansion Network that extrapolates the 2D im-age into a plausible 3D
anatomical volume; and (3) an OCT Realism Refiner, based on a 3D GAN, that
renders the structural volume with authentic textures, speckle noise, and other
imaging characteristics. Using Print2Volume, we generated a large-scale
synthetic dataset of 420,000 samples. Quantitative experiments demonstrate the
high quality of our synthetic data and its significant impact on recognition
performance. By pre-training a recognition model on our synthetic data and
fine-tuning it on a small real-world dataset, we achieved a remarkable
reduction in the Equal Error Rate (EER) from 15.62% to 2.50% on the ZJUT-EIFD
benchmark, proving the effectiveness of our approach in overcoming data
scarcity.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful tool for remote sensing,

Motivation: 目前WSI缺乏标准元数据标准，大规模集合依靠手动检查效率低下，影响AI算法训练和验证的聚集选择

Method: 提出一种通用框架生成WSI的2D索引地图，采用三层结构（来源、组织类型、病理改变）对WSI内容进行细粒度分类和标注

Conclusion: 该标准化框架有效解决了WSI大规模集合的元数据缺失问题，为AI算法开发提供了自动化的组织选择和分析能力，推进了数字病理学的发展

Abstract: A Whole Slide Image (WSI) is a high-resolution digital image created by
scanning an entire glass slide containing a biological specimen, such as tissue
sections or cell samples, at multiple magnifications. These images can be
viewed, analyzed, shared digitally, and are used today for Artificial
Intelligence (AI) algorithm development. WSIs are used in a variety of fields,
including pathology for diagnosing diseases and oncology for cancer research.
They are also utilized in neurology, veterinary medicine, hematology,
microbiology, dermatology, pharmacology, toxicology, immunology, and forensic
science.
  When assembling cohorts for the training or validation of an AI algorithm, it
is essential to know what is present on such a WSI. However, there is currently
no standard for this metadata, so such selection has mainly been done through
manual inspection, which is not suitable for large collections with several
million objects.
  We propose a general framework to generate a 2D index map for WSI and a
profiling mechanism for specific application domains. We demonstrate this
approach in the field of clinical pathology, using common syntax and semantics
to achieve interoperability between different catalogs.
  Our approach augments each WSI collection with a detailed tissue map that
provides fine-grained information about the WSI content. The tissue map is
organized into three layers: source, tissue type, and pathological alterations,
with each layer assigning segments of the WSI to specific classes.
  We illustrate the advantages and applicability of the proposed standard
through specific examples in WSI catalogs, Machine Learning (ML), and

*Lucas Rakotoarivony*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于置信度伪标签的无监督增量学习方法ICPL，用伪标签替代人工标注，使模型能够从未标注数据集中进行增量学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中经常出现训练时未见的新类别，需要模型增量学习新知识。现有的类增量学习方法假设增量数据集完全标注，这在实践中不现实。

Method: 使用置信度伪标签替代人工标注，将伪标签集成到各种CIL方法中，并通过置信度选择机制进行优化。在CIFAR100、ImageNet100和细粒度数据集上进行评估。

Result: ICPL取得了与监督方法竞争的结果，在最终准确率上比最先进的class-iNCD方法高出5%以上，验证了其在资源受限环境中的适用性。

Conclusion: ICPL方法有效解决了无标注数据下的增量学习问题，在多个数据集上表现出色，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many
computer vision tasks. However, in real-world scenarios, novel classes that
were unseen during training often emerge, requiring models to acquire new
knowledge incrementally. Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) methods enable a
model to learn novel classes while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
However, these methods make the strong assumption that the incremental dataset
is fully labeled, which is unrealistic in practice. In this work, we propose an
unsupervised Incremental Learning method using Confidence-based Pseudo-labels
(ICPL), which replaces human annotations with pseudo-labels, enabling
incremental learning from unlabeled datasets. We integrate these pseudo-labels
into various CIL methods with confidence-based selection and evaluate
performance degradation on CIFAR100 and ImageNet100. Then, we compare our
approach to popular Class Incremental Novel Category Discovery (class-iNCD)
methods addressing similar challenges. Additionally, we apply our method to
fine-grained datasets to demonstrate its real-world practicality and measure
its computational complexity to validate its suitability for
resource-constrained environments. ICPL achieves competitive results compared
to supervised methods and outperforms state-of-the-art class-iNCD methods by
more than 5% in final accuracy.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了MedShift模型，通过Flow Matching和Schrodinger Bridges技术，解决合成医学数据与实际临床图像间的域间跨越问题，支持高保真的多域图像翻译。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成医学数据虽然可扩展模型训练，但与实际临床环境存在显著域间差异，限制了其通用性。需要解决合成与真实头部X光图像在衰减行为、噪声特征和软组织表现方面的差异。

Method: 基于Flow Matching和Schrodinger Bridges的统一类条件生成模垅MedShift，学习共享的域无关潜在空间，支持训练期间任意域对间的无对图像翻译。还提供了X-DigiSkull数据集用于测试。

Result: 小于滴水模型的MedShift仍获得了强劲性能，推理时可根据需要优先考虑觉知保真性或结构一致性，显示了在医学图像域适配中的扩展性和通用性。

Conclusion: MedShift作为一种可扩展的域适配方案，通过统一的生成框架有效缩小了合成与真实医学图像间的域差距，为医学图像领域的域适配提供了可扩展且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Synthetic medical data offers a scalable solution for training robust models,
but significant domain gaps limit its generalizability to real-world clinical
settings. This paper addresses the challenge of cross-domain translation
between synthetic and real X-ray images of the head, focusing on bridging
discrepancies in attenuation behavior, noise characteristics, and soft tissue
representation. We propose MedShift, a unified class-conditional generative
model based on Flow Matching and Schrodinger Bridges, which enables
high-fidelity, unpaired image translation across multiple domains. Unlike prior
approaches that require domain-specific training or rely on paired data,
MedShift learns a shared domain-agnostic latent space and supports seamless
translation between any pair of domains seen during training. We introduce
X-DigiSkull, a new dataset comprising aligned synthetic and real skull X-rays
under varying radiation doses, to benchmark domain translation models.
Experimental results demonstrate that, despite its smaller model size compared
to diffusion-based approaches, MedShift offers strong performance and remains
flexible at inference time, as it can be tuned to prioritize either perceptual
fidelity or structural consistency, making it a scalable and generalizable
solution for domain adaptation in medical imaging. The code and dataset are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有全球产品主要关注二元树冠覆盖或冠层高度，无法在个体水平识别树木，大尺度个体树木监测存在建模不足的问题。

Method: 使用深度学习方法，在3米分辨率PlanetScope影像上检测大型个体树木。通过可扩展大小的高斯核模拟树冠，提取冠层中心并生成二元树冠覆盖图。训练数据来自机载激光雷达自动提取的数十亿个点。

Abstract: Trees are key components of the terrestrial biosphere, playing vital roles in
ecosystem function, climate regulation, and the bioeconomy. However,
large-scale monitoring of individual trees remains limited by inadequate
modelling. Available global products have focused on binary tree cover or
canopy height, which do not explicitely identify trees at individual level. In
this study, we present a deep learning approach for detecting large individual
trees in 3-m resolution PlanetScope imagery at a global scale. We simulate tree
crowns with Gaussian kernels of scalable size, allowing the extraction of crown
centers and the generation of binary tree cover maps. Training is based on
billions of points automatically extracted from airborne lidar data, enabling
the model to successfully identify trees both inside and outside forests. We
compare against existing tree cover maps and airborne lidar with
state-of-the-art performance (fractional cover R$^2 = 0.81$ against aerial
lidar), report balanced detection metrics across biomes, and demonstrate how
detection can be further improved through fine-tuning with manual labels. Our
method offers a scalable framework for global, high-resolution tree monitoring,
and is adaptable to future satellite missions offering improved imagery.

Motivation: 解决3D高斯溅射在动态场景中面临的高数据量和长训练时间问题，为流式任务提供高效训练方案

Method: 采用基于锚点的分层高斯组织、混合变形与生成策略、双向自适应掩码机制

Result: 在保持优异视觉质量的同时，显著减少了训练时间，优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: M框架为动态3D高斯溅射提供了一种可扩展且高效的解决方案，在训练效率和渲染质量方面取得了显著提升

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-fidelity real-time rendering, a key
requirement for immersive applications. However, the extension of 3DGS to
dynamic scenes remains limitations on the substantial data volume of dense
Gaussians and the prolonged training time required for each frame. This paper
presents \M, a scalable Gaussian Splatting framework designed for efficient
training in streaming tasks. Specifically, Gaussian spheres are hierarchically
organized by scale within an anchor-based structure. Coarser-level Gaussians
represent the low-resolution structure of the scene, while finer-level
Gaussians, responsible for detailed high-fidelity rendering, are selectively
activated by the coarser-level Gaussians. To further reduce computational
overhead, we introduce a hybrid deformation and spawning strategy that models
motion of inter-frame through Gaussian deformation and triggers Gaussian
spawning to characterize wide-range motion. Additionally, a bidirectional
adaptive masking mechanism enhances training efficiency by removing static
regions and prioritizing informative viewpoints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that \M~ achieves superior visual quality while significantly
reducing training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级图像描述模型，参数量仅为125M，比LLaMA-7B小56倍，性能却能与大型多模态通用模型相媲美，并开发了Sharp-Eyed Refinement框架来解决视觉盲区问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于多模态大语言模型计算需求高，难以在本地设备部署，需要开发轻量级但性能相当的图像描述模型。

Method: 基于125M参数语言模型构建专家模型，通过Sharp-Eyed Refinement框架增强视觉定位能力，使用DeepLens提取详细视觉表示。

Result: 模型在单句和详细描述任务上表现优异，性能接近大型多模态通用模型，框架有效缓解了视觉盲区问题。

Conclusion: 轻量级专家模型可作为设备端应用的强视觉专家，Sharp-Eyed Refinement框架显著提升了描述质量。

Abstract: Image captioning is fundamental for applications like video instruction
systems and exploration robots, yet deploying such models on local devices is
challenging due to the high computational demands of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). To address this, we first explore lightweight captioning by
implementing a specialist based on a 125M-parameter language model, 56 times
smaller than LLaMA-7B, and evaluating its performance on both single-sentence
and detailed captioning tasks. Surprisingly, we find that our model can achieve
performance comparable to large multimodal generalists, suggesting its
potential to serve as a strong visual specialist for on-device applications.
While promising, our model also exhibits a limitation: like other MLLMs, it
suffers from visual blindness, occasionally resulting in semantic captioning
errors. We carry out toy experiments and investigate the underlying causes,
where we observe that the problems arise from ineffective attention mechanisms
and limited visual representations. To alleviate them, we develop a novel
captioning framework, Sharp-Eyed Refinement, which enhances caption quality
through improved visual grounding. At its core, our DeepLens extracts detailed
visual representations by concentrating on informative regions identified
during the initial glance. Our experiments confirm both the advantages of our
specialist over prior small captioning models and large generalists and the
effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: While foundation models (FMs) offer strong potential for AI-based dementia
diagnosis, their integration into federated learning (FL) systems remains
underexplored. In this benchmarking study, we systematically evaluate the
impact of key design choices: classification head architecture, fine-tuning
strategy, and aggregation method, on the performance and efficiency of
federated FM tuning using brain MRI data. Using a large multi-cohort dataset,
we find that the architecture of the classification head substantially
influences performance, freezing the FM encoder achieves comparable results to
full fine-tuning, and advanced aggregation methods outperform standard
federated averaging. Our results offer practical insights for deploying FMs in
decentralized clinical settings and highlight trade-offs that should guide
future method development.

TL;DR: 提出MME评分方法，通过结合特征截断和多种评分函数来提升OOD检测性能，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法通常只关注单一技术或特定类型OOD数据集，忽略了组合多种现有解决方案的潜力

Method: 提出多方法集成(MME)评分，将最先进的特征截断技术和多种评分函数统一到一个更有效的评分函数中

Result: 在大型和小型基准测试中，MME在所有基准上都显著优于最新方法，在ImageNet-1K上FPR95达到27.57%，比最佳基线提升6%

Conclusion: 特征截断和评分函数的有效组合以及多评分函数聚合能够显著提升OOD检测的鲁棒性和性能

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for neural networks
operating in open-world settings, particularly in safety-critical applications.
Existing methods have improved OOD detection by leveraging two main techniques:
feature truncation, which increases the separation between in-distribution (ID)
and OOD samples, and scoring functions, which assign scores to distinguish
between ID and OOD data. However, most approaches either focus on a single
family of techniques or evaluate their effectiveness on a specific type of OOD
dataset, overlooking the potential of combining multiple existing solutions.
Motivated by this observation, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate
that state-of-the-art feature truncation and scoring functions can be
effectively combined. Moreover, we show that aggregating multiple scoring
functions enhances robustness against various types of OOD samples. Based on
these insights, we propose the Multi-Method Ensemble (MME) score, which unifies
state-of-the-art OOD detectors into a single, more effective scoring function.
Extensive experiments on both large-scale and small-scale benchmarks, covering
near-OOD and far-OOD scenarios, show that MME significantly outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks. Notably, using the BiT model,
our method achieves an average FPR95 of 27.57% on the challenging ImageNet-1K
benchmark, improving performance by 6% over the best existing baseline.

Motivation: 现有基于数据变换的方法在增强对抗样本迁移性时，过度增强背景或无关区域可能引入干扰导致误检，这些错误并非对抗补丁本身造成

Method: 局部增强方法，仅对目标区域应用增强，避免影响非目标区域，使损失函数更直接关注对抗补丁对检测模型的影响

Result: 在HRSC2016数据集上的实验表明，该方法有效提高了对抗补丁攻击的成功率并增强了其迁移性

Conclusion: 局部增强方法通过减少背景干扰，使对抗攻击更专注于目标区域，显著提升了攻击效果和迁移能力

Abstract: Current ship detection techniques based on remote sensing imagery primarily
rely on the object detection capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs).
However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, which can lead to
misclassification by the detection model or complete evasion of the targets.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that data transformation-based methods can
improve the transferability of adversarial examples. However, excessive
augmentation of image backgrounds or irrelevant regions may introduce
unnecessary interference, resulting in false detections of the object detection
model. These errors are not caused by the adversarial patches themselves but
rather by the over-augmentation of background and non-target areas. This paper
proposes a localized augmentation method that applies augmentation only to the
target regions, avoiding any influence on non-target areas. By reducing
background interference, this approach enables the loss function to focus more
directly on the impact of the adversarial patch on the detection model, thereby
improving the attack success rate. Experiments conducted on the HRSC2016
dataset demonstrate that the proposed method effectively increases the success
rate of adversarial patch attacks and enhances their transferability.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个专门针对长视频幻觉的基准ELV-Halluc，系统研究了语义聚合幻觉(SAH)现象，发现SAH随语义复杂性增加而增加，并提出位置编码策略和DPO训练方法来缓解SAH问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频多模态大语言模型在视频理解方面取得显著进展，但仍容易产生与视频输入不一致或无关的幻觉内容。之前的幻觉基准主要关注短视频，且将幻觉归因于语言先验、缺失帧或视觉编码器引入的偏差，但这些原因过于简化。特别是在长视频中，语义聚合过程中的幻觉问题更加严重。

Method: 1) 构建首个长视频幻觉基准ELV-Halluc；2) 系统研究语义聚合幻觉(SAH)现象；3) 分析SAH与语义复杂性和语义变化速度的关系；4) 提出位置编码策略缓解SAH；5) 采用DPO策略增强模型区分事件内外语义的能力；6) 构建包含8K对抗数据对的数据集。

Result: 实验证实了SAH的存在，显示SAH随语义复杂性增加而增加，模型在快速变化的语义上更容易产生SAH。通过提出的方法，在ELV-Halluc和Video-MME基准上均取得改进，SAH比率大幅降低27.7%。

Conclusion: 该研究首次系统性地识别和分析了长视频中的语义聚合幻觉问题，提出的基准和方法为理解和缓解视频多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题提供了重要基础，特别是在处理复杂长视频内容时具有重要意义。

Abstract: Video multimodal large language models (Video-MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, they remain vulnerable to
hallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs.
Previous video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They
attribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing
frames, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these
causes indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still
oversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect
outputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of
hallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during
the process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic
groups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to
increased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to
separate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination.
To address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark
dedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of
SAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases
with semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to
SAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to
mitigate SAH. We demonstrate that positional encoding strategy contributes to
alleviating SAH, and further adopt DPO strategy to enhance the model's ability
to distinguish semantics within and across events. To support this, we curate a
dataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and achieve improvements on both
ELV-Halluc and Video-MME, including a substantial 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio.

Method: 训练卷积神经网络，参考输入图像对低分辨率基础模型特征进行上采样，无需额外训练即可应用于多种显微图像的分割任务

Result: 上采样后的丰富特征能够分离难以分割的相（如发丝裂纹），交互式分割相比传统卷积网络需要更少的标签和训练时间

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了显微图像分割的效率和精度，为材料科学和生物图像分析提供了有效的特征增强解决方案

Abstract: Feature foundation models - usually vision transformers - offer rich semantic
descriptors of images, useful for downstream tasks such as (interactive)
segmentation and object detection. For computational efficiency these
descriptors are often patch-based, and so struggle to represent the fine
features often present in micrographs; they also struggle with the large image
sizes present in materials and biological image analysis. In this work, we
train a convolutional neural network to upsample low-resolution (i.e, large
patch size) foundation model features with reference to the input image. We
apply this upsampler network (without any further training) to efficiently
featurise and then segment a variety of microscopy images, including plant
cells, a lithium-ion battery cathode and organic crystals. The richness of
these upsampled features admits separation of hard to segment phases, like
hairline cracks. We demonstrate that interactive segmentation with these deep
features produces high-quality segmentations far faster and with far fewer
labels than training or finetuning a more traditional convolutional network.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机场景中广阔的视野和复杂的组合语义对视觉语言理解提出挑战，现有的视觉语言模型缺乏细粒度语义，层次化方法依赖精确实体划分，在动态环境中效果有限。

Method: 提出HCCM框架，包含：(1)区域-全局图像文本对比学习(RG-ITC)，避免精确场景划分，捕捉层次化局部到全局语义；(2)区域-全局图像文本匹配(RG-ITM)，评估全局跨模态表示中的局部语义一致性；(3)动量对比蒸馏(MCD)机制提高鲁棒性。

Conclusion: HCCM框架有效解决了无人机场景中的视觉语言理解挑战，在细粒度语义捕捉和零样本泛化方面表现出色，为自然语言引导的无人机应用提供了有力解决方案。

Abstract: Natural Language-Guided Drones (NLGD) provide a novel paradigm for tasks such
as target matching and navigation. However, the wide field of view and complex
compositional semantics in drone scenarios pose challenges for vision-language
understanding. Mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs) emphasize global
alignment while lacking fine-grained semantics, and existing hierarchical
methods depend on precise entity partitioning and strict containment, limiting
effectiveness in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose the
Hierarchical Cross-Granularity Contrastive and Matching learning (HCCM)
framework with two components: (1) Region-Global Image-Text Contrastive
Learning (RG-ITC), which avoids precise scene partitioning and captures
hierarchical local-to-global semantics by contrasting local visual regions with
global text and vice versa; (2) Region-Global Image-Text Matching (RG-ITM),
which dispenses with rigid constraints and instead evaluates local semantic
consistency within global cross-modal representations, enhancing compositional
reasoning. Moreover, drone text descriptions are often incomplete or ambiguous,
destabilizing alignment. HCCM introduces a Momentum Contrast and Distillation
(MCD) mechanism to improve robustness. Experiments on GeoText-1652 show HCCM
achieves state-of-the-art Recall@1 of 28.8% (image retrieval) and 14.7% (text
retrieval). On the unseen ERA dataset, HCCM demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization with 39.93% mean recall (mR), outperforming fine-tuned
baselines.

Conclusion: 提出的生成式方法能够有效解决单图像3D场景重建中的遮挡补全问题，相比传统回归方法具有更好的重建质量和多样性。

Abstract: Gaussian splatting typically requires dense observations of the scene and can
fail to reconstruct occluded and unobserved areas. We propose a latent
diffusion model to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with Gaussian splats,
including the occluded parts, from only a single image during inference.
Completing the unobserved surfaces of a scene is challenging due to the
ambiguity of the plausible surfaces. Conventional methods use a
regression-based formulation to predict a single "mode" for occluded and
out-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to
capture multiple possible explanations. Thus, they often address this problem
partially, focusing either on objects isolated from the background,
reconstructing only visible surfaces, or failing to extrapolate far from the
input views. In contrast, we propose a generative formulation to learn a
distribution of 3D representations of Gaussian splats conditioned on a single
input image. To address the lack of ground-truth training data, we propose a
Variational AutoReconstructor to learn a latent space only from 2D images in a
self-supervised manner, over which a diffusion model is trained. Our method
generates faithful reconstructions and diverse samples with the ability to
complete the occluded surfaces for high-quality 360-degree renderings.

Conclusion: 结合CLIP先验知识和不确定性感知采样，为成对排序提供了高效可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Pairwise comparison is often favored over absolute rating or ordinal
classification in subjective or difficult annotation tasks due to its improved
reliability. However, exhaustive comparisons require a massive number of
annotations (O(n^2)). Recent work has greatly reduced the annotation burden
(O(n log n)) by actively sampling pairwise comparisons using a sorting
algorithm. We further improve annotation efficiency by (1) roughly pre-ordering
items using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model
hierarchically without training, and (2) replacing easy, obvious human
comparisons with automated comparisons. The proposed EZ-Sort first produces a
CLIP-based zero-shot pre-ordering, then initializes bucket-aware Elo scores,
and finally runs an uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort. Validation
was conducted using various datasets: face-age estimation (FGNET), historical
image chronology (DHCI), and retinal image quality assessment (EyePACS). It
showed that EZ-Sort reduced human annotation cost by 90.5% compared to
exhaustive pairwise comparisons and by 19.8% compared to prior work (when n =
100), while improving or maintaining inter-rater reliability. These results
demonstrate that combining CLIP-based priors with uncertainty-aware sampling
yields an efficient and scalable solution for pairwise ranking.

Result: 通过广泛评估，ECHO在自我中心人机交互重建方面超越了现有方法，达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: ECHO首次提出了从最小观察中统一恢复三种模态的框架，证明了仅通过头部和手腕跟踪就能有效恢复人机交互信息，为可穿戴设备应用提供了重要技术基础。

Abstract: Modeling human-object interactions (HOI) from an egocentric perspective is a
largely unexplored yet important problem due to the increasing adoption of
wearable devices, such as smart glasses and watches. We investigate how much
information about interaction can be recovered from only head and wrists
tracking. Our answer is ECHO (Ego-Centric modeling of Human-Object
interactions), which, for the first time, proposes a unified framework to
recover three modalities: human pose, object motion, and contact from such
minimal observation. ECHO employs a Diffusion Transformer architecture and a
unique three-variate diffusion process, which jointly models human motion,
object trajectory, and contact sequence, allowing for flexible input
configurations. Our method operates in a head-centric canonical space,
enhancing robustness to global orientation. We propose a conveyor-based
inference, which progressively increases the diffusion timestamp with the frame
position, allowing us to process sequences of any length. Through extensive
evaluation, we demonstrate that ECHO outperforms existing methods that do not
offer the same flexibility, setting a state-of-the-art in egocentric HOI
reconstruction.

*Juneyoung Ro,Namwoo Kim,Yoonjin Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了BLIP-2、InstructBLIP和LLaVA-1.5三种现成视觉语言模型在城市场景中的空间推理能力，通过合成VQA数据集进行微调，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在通用场景上预训练，但其在城市领域中的细粒度空间推理能力（如物体、布局和深度线索）尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 构建基于街景图像分割、深度和物体检测预测的合成VQA数据集，使用LLM生成包含逐步推理的思维链答案，对三种VLMs进行零样本评估和微调实验。

Result: VLMs在零样本设置下表现合理，但使用合成的思维链监督数据集微调后性能显著提升，特别是在否定和反事实等挑战性问题类型上。

Conclusion: 研究提出了城市空间推理作为VLMs的新挑战，并展示了合成数据集构建作为通用模型适应专业领域的实用路径。

Abstract: Effectively understanding urban scenes requires fine-grained spatial
reasoning about objects, layouts, and depth cues. However, how well current
vision-language models (VLMs), pretrained on general scenes, transfer these
abilities to urban domain remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
conduct a comparative study of three off-the-shelf VLMs-BLIP-2, InstructBLIP,
and LLaVA-1.5-evaluating both zero-shot performance and the effects of
fine-tuning with a synthetic VQA dataset specific to urban scenes. We construct
such dataset from segmentation, depth, and object detection predictions of
street-view images, pairing each question with LLM-generated Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) answers for step-by-step reasoning supervision. Results show that while
VLMs perform reasonably well in zero-shot settings, fine-tuning with our
synthetic CoT-supervised dataset substantially boosts performance, especially
for challenging question types such as negation and counterfactuals. This study
introduces urban spatial reasoning as a new challenge for VLMs and demonstrates
synthetic dataset construction as a practical path for adapting general-purpose
models to specialized domains.

TL;DR: 提出了Temporal Flow Matching (TFM)方法，用于4D医学图像预测，能够学习时间分布并支持3D体积、多时间点和不规则采样，在三个公共纵向数据集上超越了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法大多只考虑单一时间上下文，或专注于分类/回归任务，无法进行细粒度空间预测，且往往局限于单时间点或特定疾病，存在技术限制。

Method: Temporal Flow Matching (TFM) - 统一的生成式轨迹方法，能够学习底层时间分布，支持3D体积、多先验扫描和不规则采样，并能回退到最近图像预测器。

Result: 在三个公共纵向数据集上的广泛基准测试表明，TFM始终超越自然成像中的时空方法，为4D医学图像预测建立了新的最先进和稳健的基线。

Conclusion: TFM方法成功解决了医学成像中时间动态建模的根本性差距，为疾病进展建模、治疗规划和解剖发育跟踪等应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding temporal dynamics in medical imaging is crucial for
applications such as disease progression modeling, treatment planning and
anatomical development tracking. However, most deep learning methods either
consider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification
or regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions.
While some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single
timepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address
this fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified
generative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal
distribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e.
predicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports
$3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive
benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently
surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new
state-of-the-art and robust baseline for $4D$ medical image prediction.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了通过深度学习整合预临CT和本后病理全手片图像来预测清洁细胞肾癌复发风险的多模态方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Leibovich评分在远处复发风险分层方面有限，缺乏患者级别的分辨率并排除了形态学信息。需要开发更个性化的复发风险预测方法。

Method: 使用预训练编码器和Cox生存分析的模块化深度学习框架，测试了单模态、后期融合和中间融合等不同设置。

Result: 病理WSI模型表现一致超过CT模型，中间融合进一步提高性能，最佳模型接近调整Leibovich评分。形态学通过融合添加了价值。

Conclusion: 证明了基础模型基于多模态整合进行个性化ccRCC风险预测的可行性，未来需要探索更表达力强的融合策略和更大的多模态数据集。

Abstract: Recurrence risk estimation in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is
essential for guiding postoperative surveillance and treatment. The Leibovich
score remains widely used for stratifying distant recurrence risk but offers
limited patient-level resolution and excludes imaging information. This study
evaluates multimodal recurrence prediction by integrating preoperative computed
tomography (CT) and postoperative histopathology whole-slide images (WSIs). A
modular deep learning framework with pretrained encoders and Cox-based survival
modeling was tested across unimodal, late fusion, and intermediate fusion
setups. In a real-world ccRCC cohort, WSI-based models consistently
outperformed CT-only models, underscoring the prognostic strength of pathology.
Intermediate fusion further improved performance, with the best model
(TITAN-CONCH with ResNet-18) approaching the adjusted Leibovich score. Random
tie-breaking narrowed the gap between the clinical baseline and learned models,
suggesting discretization may overstate individualized performance. Using
simple embedding concatenation, radiology added value primarily through fusion.
These findings demonstrate the feasibility of foundation model-based multimodal
integration for personalized ccRCC risk prediction. Future work should explore
more expressive fusion strategies, larger multimodal datasets, and
general-purpose CT encoders to better match pathology modeling capacity.

TL;DR: 该论文提出从基于单词的OCR转向基于行级别的OCR，以绕过单词分割错误并提供更大的句子上下文，从而提升准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OCR技术存在字符分割错误问题，现代方法虽然通过单词级识别避免了字符分割，但单词分割成为新的瓶颈。作者观察到需要进一步发展到行级别OCR来绕过单词检测错误，并提供更大的句子上下文以更好地利用语言模型。

Method: 提出从单词级OCR自然过渡到行级OCR的方法，通过直接处理整行文本来避免单词分割错误，并利用更大的句子上下文。作者还创建了一个包含251个英文页面图像的行级标注数据集用于训练和基准测试。

Result: 实验显示端到端准确率显著提高了5.4%，效率相比基于单词的流水线提高了4倍。

Conclusion: 行级OCR不仅提高了准确性和效率，还为利用大型语言模型的持续改进提供了潜力，特别是在文档图像处理方面具有重要价值。

Abstract: Conventional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques segmented each
character and then recognized. This made them prone to error in character
segmentation, and devoid of context to exploit language models. Advances in
sequence to sequence translation in last decade led to modern techniques first
detecting words and then inputting one word at a time to a model to directly
output full words as sequence of characters. This allowed better utilization of
language models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step. We observe
that the above transition in style has moved the bottleneck in accuracy to word
segmentation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a natural and logical
progression from word level OCR to line-level OCR. The proposal allows to
bypass errors in word detection, and provides larger sentence context for
better utilization of language models. We show that the proposed technique not
only improves the accuracy but also efficiency of OCR. Despite our thorough
literature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark
such shift from word to line-level OCR. Hence, we also contribute a
meticulously curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level
annotations. Our experimentation revealed a notable end-to-end accuracy
improvement of 5.4%, underscoring the potential benefits of transitioning
towards line-level OCR, especially for document images. We also report a 4
times improvement in efficiency compared to word-based pipelines. With
continuous improvements in large language models, our methodology also holds
potential to exploit such advances. Project Website:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习基于计算机生成全息术的三大挑战：终端到终端网络忽视物理关系导致可解释性和灵活性不足；CNN基算法感知野有限影响全局上下文捕获；角谱方法基模型仅限于有限近场。

Method: 提出深度展开网络(DUN)，将梯度下降分解为两个模块：适应带宽保持模型(ABPM)和相位域复数值去噪器(PCD)。ABPM支持更宽的工作距离，PCD利用复数值可变形自注意力模块捕获全局特征。

Result: 在模拟和实际数据上达到了最先进的性能，PSNR超过35dB，对比ASM基方法有更宽的工作距离范围。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合物理模型和深度学习的深度展开等略，有效解决了CGH中的准确性、稳定性和全局上下文捕获问题，为计算机生成全息术提供了更灵活和高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) has gained wide attention with deep
learning-based algorithms. However, due to its nonlinear and ill-posed nature,
challenges remain in achieving accurate and stable reconstruction.
Specifically, ($i$) the widely used end-to-end networks treat the
reconstruction model as a black box, ignoring underlying physical
relationships, which reduces interpretability and flexibility. ($ii$) CNN-based
CGH algorithms have limited receptive fields, hindering their ability to
capture long-range dependencies and global context. ($iii$) Angular spectrum
method (ASM)-based models are constrained to finite near-fields.In this paper,
we propose a Deep Unfolding Network (DUN) that decomposes gradient descent into
two modules: an adaptive bandwidth-preserving model (ABPM) and a phase-domain
complex-valued denoiser (PCD), providing more flexibility. ABPM allows for
wider working distances compared to ASM-based methods. At the same time, PCD
leverages its complex-valued deformable self-attention module to capture global
features and enhance performance, achieving a PSNR over 35 dB. Experiments on
simulated and real data show state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: 提示式模型在多示踪剂、多中心PET/CT中具有实现高效用户引导分割工作流程的潜力，代码已公开。

Abstract: Whole-body PET/CT is a cornerstone of oncological imaging, yet accurate
lesion segmentation remains challenging due to tracer heterogeneity,
physiological uptake, and multi-center variability. While fully automated
methods have advanced substantially, clinical practice benefits from approaches
that keep humans in the loop to efficiently refine predicted masks. The
autoPET/CT IV challenge addresses this need by introducing interactive
segmentation tasks based on simulated user prompts. In this work, we present
our submission to Task 1. Building on the winning autoPET III nnU-Net pipeline,
we extend the framework with promptable capabilities by encoding user-provided
foreground and background clicks as additional input channels. We
systematically investigate representations for spatial prompts and demonstrate
that Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) encodings consistently outperform
Gaussian kernels. Furthermore, we propose online simulation of user
interactions and a custom point sampling strategy to improve robustness under
realistic prompting conditions. Our ensemble of EDT-based models, trained with
and without external data, achieves the strongest cross-validation performance,
reducing both false positives and false negatives compared to baseline models.
These results highlight the potential of promptable models to enable efficient,
user-guided segmentation workflows in multi-tracer, multi-center PET/CT. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HD地图构建方法使用基于注意力的标准映射技术存在泛化问题，容易产生虚假道路元素，需要更精确的图像到BEV空间映射方法

Method: 基于相机参数的几何映射+概率投影机制+置信度分数过滤+时序信息选择性累积

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse2数据集上超越现有最佳方法，特别是在长感知范围任务中表现突出

Conclusion: 提出的概率投影机制能有效提高HD地图构建的准确性和泛化性能，置信度分数机制在过滤噪声和时序处理中发挥关键作用

Abstract: Constructing high-definition (HD) maps from sensory input requires accurately
mapping the road elements in image space to the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space.
The precision of this mapping directly impacts the quality of the final
vectorized HD map. Existing HD mapping approaches outsource the projection to
standard mapping techniques, such as attention-based ones. However, these
methods struggle with accuracy due to generalization problems, often
hallucinating non-existent road elements. Our key idea is to start with a
geometric mapping based on camera parameters and adapt it to the scene to
extract relevant map information from camera images. To implement this, we
propose a novel probabilistic projection mechanism with confidence scores to
(i) refine the mapping to better align with the scene and (ii) filter out
irrelevant elements that should not influence HD map generation. In addition,
we improve temporal processing by using confidence scores to selectively
accumulate reliable information over time. Experiments on new splits of the
nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate improved performance over
state-of-the-art approaches, indicating better generalization. The improvements
are particularly pronounced on nuScenes and in the challenging long perception
range. Our code and model checkpoints are available at

TL;DR: FLORA是一种轻量级合成数据生成方法，使用LoRA微调Flux 1.1扩散模型，仅需消费级GPU和500张合成图像就能在目标检测任务中超越需要5000张合成图像的基线方法。

Motivation: 解决现有扩散模型数据增强方法计算资源需求高、需要企业级GPU和大量合成图像的问题，使合成数据生成更加实用和易于获取。

Method: 使用Flux 1.1 Dev扩散模型，通过低秩适应（LoRA）进行微调，构建轻量级合成数据生成流水线。

Result: 在7个不同目标检测数据集上，仅用500张合成图像训练的检测器性能优于使用5000张合成图像的ODGEN基线，mAP@.50:.95提升高达21.3%。

Conclusion: FLORA证明了以质量和效率为重点的方法比暴力生成更有效，用10%的数据和少量计算成本就能达到最先进性能，使合成数据创建在实际场景中更加实用和可及。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated
significant potential in augmenting scarce datasets for object detection tasks.
Nevertheless, most recent models rely on resource-intensive full fine-tuning of
large-scale diffusion models, requiring enterprise-grade GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA
V100) and thousands of synthetic images. To address these limitations, we
propose Flux LoRA Augmentation (FLORA), a lightweight synthetic data generation
pipeline. Our approach uses the Flux 1.1 Dev diffusion model, fine-tuned
exclusively through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This dramatically reduces
computational requirements, enabling synthetic dataset generation with a
consumer-grade GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090). We empirically evaluate our
approach on seven diverse object detection datasets. Our results demonstrate
that training object detectors with just 500 synthetic images generated by our
approach yields superior detection performance compared to models trained on
5000 synthetic images from the ODGEN baseline, achieving improvements of up to
21.3% in mAP@.50:.95. This work demonstrates that it is possible to surpass
state-of-the-art performance with far greater efficiency, as FLORA achieves
superior results using only 10% of the data and a fraction of the computational
cost. This work demonstrates that a quality and efficiency-focused approach is
more effective than brute-force generation, making advanced synthetic data
creation more practical and accessible for real-world scenarios.

Result: 对抗性输入使早期卷积层激活熵产生7%的偏移，检测准确率达到90%，假阳性和假阴性率低于20%

Conclusion: CNN激活熵能够有效编码分布偏移，通过监测熵值变化可以实现实时对抗性攻击检测，且不影响原始模型性能

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the foundation of modern
computer vision, achieving unprecedented accuracy across diverse image
recognition tasks. While these networks excel on in-distribution data, they
remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations imperceptible input
modifications that cause misclassification with high confidence. However,
existing detection methods either require expensive retraining, modify network
architecture, or degrade performance on clean inputs. Here we show that
adversarial perturbations create immediate, detectable entropy signatures in
CNN activations that can be monitored without any model modification. Using
parallel entropy monitoring on VGG-16, we demonstrate that adversarial inputs
consistently shift activation entropy by 7% in early convolutional layers,
enabling 90% detection accuracy with false positives and false negative rates
below 20%. The complete separation between clean and adversarial entropy
distributions reveals that CNNs inherently encode distribution shifts in their
activation patterns. This work establishes that CNN reliability can be assessed
through activation entropy alone, enabling practical deployment of
self-diagnostic vision systems that detect adversarial inputs in real-time
without compromising original model performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities across various multimodal tasks. They continue,
however, to struggle with trivial scenarios such as reading values from Digital
Measurement Devices (DMDs), particularly in real-world conditions involving
clutter, occlusions, extreme viewpoints, and motion blur; common in
head-mounted cameras and Augmented Reality (AR) applications. Motivated by
these limitations, this work introduces CAD2DMD-SET, a synthetic data
generation tool designed to support visual question answering (VQA) tasks
involving DMDs. By leveraging 3D CAD models, advanced rendering, and
high-fidelity image composition, our tool produces diverse, VQA-labelled
synthetic DMD datasets suitable for fine-tuning LVLMs. Additionally, we present
DMDBench, a curated validation set of 1,000 annotated real-world images
designed to evaluate model performance under practical constraints.
Benchmarking three state-of-the-art LVLMs using Average Normalised Levenshtein
Similarity (ANLS) and further fine-tuning LoRA's of these models with
CAD2DMD-SET's generated dataset yielded substantial improvements, with InternVL
showcasing a score increase of 200% without degrading on other tasks. This
demonstrates that the CAD2DMD-SET training dataset substantially improves the
robustness and performance of LVLMs when operating under the previously stated
challenging conditions. The CAD2DMD-SET tool is expected to be released as
open-source once the final version of this manuscript is prepared, allowing the
community to add different measurement devices and generate their own datasets.

Abstract: GUI agent aims to enable automated operations on Mobile/PC devices, which is
an important task toward achieving artificial general intelligence. The rapid
advancement of VLMs accelerates the development of GUI agents, owing to their
powerful capabilities in visual understanding and task planning. However,
building a GUI agent remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of
operation trajectories, the availability of interactive infrastructure, and the
limitation of initial capabilities in foundation models. In this work, we
introduce UItron, an open-source foundational model for automatic GUI agents,
featuring advanced GUI perception, grounding, and planning capabilities. UItron
highlights the necessity of systemic data engineering and interactive
infrastructure as foundational components for advancing GUI agent development.
It not only systematically studies a series of data engineering strategies to
enhance training effects, but also establishes an interactive environment
connecting both Mobile and PC devices. In training, UItron adopts supervised
finetuning over perception and planning tasks in various GUI scenarios, and
then develop a curriculum reinforcement learning framework to enable complex
reasoning and exploration for online environments. As a result, UItron achieves
superior performance in benchmarks of GUI perception, grounding, and planning.
In particular, UItron highlights the interaction proficiency with top-tier
Chinese mobile APPs, as we identified a general lack of Chinese capabilities
even in state-of-the-art solutions. To this end, we manually collect over one
million steps of operation trajectories across the top 100 most popular apps,
and build the offline and online agent evaluation environments. Experimental
results demonstrate that UItron achieves significant progress in Chinese app
scenarios, propelling GUI agents one step closer to real-world application.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有领域泛化评估对基础模型如CLIP可能不够挑战性，因为其预训练数据可能已覆盖许多基准测试。需要更好地评估CLIP在真实未见数据场景下的性能

Method: CLIP-DCA方法：1）使用单独领域头识别和增强CLIP编码器中的领域感知；2）通过合成生成多样化领域数据；3）鼓励从领域特征中分离实现领域不变分类

Result: CLIP-DCA相比现有方法在更具挑战性的评估中显示出显著改进，特别是在更OOD的数据集上表现更好

Conclusion: 增强领域感知是基础模型实现有效领域不变分类的前提，CLIP-DCA通过分离分类和增强领域感知表示的方法成功解决了CLIP在领域泛化中的性能下降问题

Abstract: Evaluating domain generalization (DG) for foundational models like CLIP is
challenging, as web-scale pretraining data potentially covers many existing
benchmarks. Consequently, current DG evaluation may neither be sufficiently
challenging nor adequately test genuinely unseen data scenarios. To better
assess the performance of CLIP on DG in-the-wild, a scenario where CLIP
encounters challenging unseen data, we consider two approaches: (1) evaluating
on 33 diverse datasets with quantified out-of-distribution (OOD) scores after
fine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet, and (2) using unlearning to make CLIP `forget'
some domains as an approximation. We observe that CLIP's performance
deteriorates significantly on more OOD datasets. To address this, we present
CLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware
representations). Our approach is motivated by the observation that while
standard domain invariance losses aim to make representations domain-invariant,
this can be harmful to foundation models by forcing the discarding of
domain-aware representations beneficial for generalization. We instead
hypothesize that enhancing domain awareness is a prerequisite for effective
domain-invariant classification in foundation models. CLIP-DCA identifies and
enhances domain awareness within CLIP's encoders using a separate domain head
and synthetically generated diverse domain data. Simultaneously, it encourages
domain-invariant classification through disentanglement from the domain
features. CLIP-DCA shows significant improvements within this challenging
evaluation compared to existing methods, particularly on datasets that are more

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了在视频学习中使用非典型异常数据对开放世界学习的益处，发现即使简单的学习方法也能在OOD检测、新类别发现和零样本动作识别等任务中带来性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在开放世界中展示出卓越的泛化和发现能力，但现有研究主要关注封闭集中的典型数据，视频领域的开放世界新发现研究不足。本文旨在探索非典型异常视频数据如何促进开放世界学习。

Method: 收集包含各种非典型异常视频数据的新数据集，将其用于模型训练过程中的表示学习，重点关注OOD检测、新类别发现和零样本动作识别三个关键任务。

Result: 实验表明，使用非典型数据的方法在各种设置下都能持续提升性能。增加非典型样本的类别多样性可进一步提升OOD检测性能；在新类别发现任务中，使用较小但语义更多样的非典型样本集比使用更大但更典型的数据集效果更好；在零样本动作识别中，非典型视频的语义多样性有助于模型更好地泛化到未见过的动作类别。

Conclusion: 非典型视频对开放世界中的视觉表示学习具有显著益处，新提出的数据集和发现鼓励该方向的进一步研究。

Abstract: Humans usually show exceptional generalisation and discovery ability in the
open world, when being shown uncommon new concepts. Whereas most existing
studies in the literature focus on common typical data from closed sets,
open-world novel discovery is under-explored in videos. In this paper, we are
interested in asking: \textit{What if atypical unusual videos are exposed in
the learning process?} To this end, we collect a new video dataset consisting
of various types of unusual atypical data (\eg sci-fi, animation, \etc). To
study how such atypical data may benefit open-world learning, we feed them into
the model training process for representation learning. Focusing on three key
tasks in open-world learning: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, novel
category discovery (NCD), and zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR), we found
that even straightforward learning approaches with atypical data consistently
improve performance across various settings. Furthermore, we found that
increasing the categorical diversity of the atypical samples further boosts OOD
detection performance. Additionally, in the NCD task, using a smaller yet more
semantically diverse set of atypical samples leads to better performance
compared to using a larger but more typical dataset. In the ZSAR setting, the
semantic diversity of atypical videos helps the model generalise better to
unseen action classes. These observations in our extensive experimental
evaluations reveal the benefits of atypical videos for visual representation
learning in the open world, together with the newly proposed dataset,
encouraging further studies in this direction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无监督视频持续学习(uVCL)方案，通过核密度估计和新颖检测来处理无任务边界和标签的视频学习问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频数据具有丰富的空间-时间信息，但在无监督持续学习领域研究不足。现有研究依赖标签和任务边界，而标签数据成本高且不实用。

Method: 使用无监督视频Transformer网络提取深度特征，采用核密度估计(KDE)作为非参数概率表示，通过新颖检测来动态扩展内存集群以捕捉新知识。

Result: 在UCF101、HMDB51和Something-to-Something V2三个标准视频数据集上进行深度评估，无需任何标签或类别边界，该方法显著提升了多任务学习性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为无监督视频持续学习提供了一个可行的解决方案，通过非参数方法有效地处理了视频数据的复杂性和内存需求。

Abstract: We propose a realistic scenario for the unsupervised video learning where
neither task boundaries nor labels are provided when learning a succession of
tasks. We also provide a non-parametric learning solution for the
under-explored problem of unsupervised video continual learning. Videos
represent a complex and rich spatio-temporal media information, widely used in
many applications, but which have not been sufficiently explored in
unsupervised continual learning. Prior studies have only focused on supervised
continual learning, relying on the knowledge of labels and task boundaries,
while having labeled data is costly and not practical. To address this gap, we
study the unsupervised video continual learning (uVCL). uVCL raises more
challenges due to the additional computational and memory requirements of
processing videos when compared to images. We introduce a general benchmark
experimental protocol for uVCL by considering the learning of unstructured
video data categories during each task. We propose to use the Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) of deep embedded video features extracted by unsupervised
video transformer networks as a non-parametric probabilistic representation of
the data. We introduce a novelty detection criterion for the incoming new task
data, dynamically enabling the expansion of memory clusters, aiming to capture
new knowledge when learning a succession of tasks. We leverage the use of
transfer learning from the previous tasks as an initial state for the knowledge
transfer to the current learning task. We found that the proposed methodology
substantially enhances the performance of the model when successively learning
many tasks. We perform in-depth evaluations on three standard video action
recognition datasets, including UCF101, HMDB51, and Something-to-Something V2,
without using any labels or class boundaries.

TL;DR: 基于nnU-Net框架，采用多阶段级联预训练策略，通过数据增强和模型集成方法，在胰腺导管腺癌MRI分割任务中取得了优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺导管腺癌MRI自动分割面临肿瘤组织对比度差和标注数据稀缺的挑战，需要开发在有限数据下高性能的专门化模型

Method: 使用nnU-Net框架，采用深度多阶段级联预训练策略：从通用解剖基础模型开始，依次在CT胰腺病变数据集和目标MRI模态上微调。通过五折交叉验证系统评估数据增强方案和训练计划，并构建定制化的异构专家模型集成

Result: Task 1获得0.661的Tumor Dice分数，Task 2获得0.523的Tumor Dice分数，Task 1达到最先进的MASD 5.46 mm和HD95 17.33 mm边界精度

Conclusion: 提出了一种在有限数据和复杂医学成像任务背景下开发专门化高性能模型的稳健方法，通过度量感知集成策略证明了其有效性

Abstract: Automated segmentation of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from MRI is
critical for clinical workflows but is hindered by poor tumor-tissue contrast
and a scarcity of annotated data. This paper details our submission to the
PANTHER challenge, addressing both diagnostic T1-weighted (Task 1) and
therapeutic T2-weighted (Task 2) segmentation. Our approach is built upon the
nnU-Net framework and leverages a deep, multi-stage cascaded pre-training
strategy, starting from a general anatomical foundation model and sequentially
fine-tuning on CT pancreatic lesion datasets and the target MRI modalities.
Through extensive five-fold cross-validation, we systematically evaluated data
augmentation schemes and training schedules. Our analysis revealed a critical
trade-off, where aggressive data augmentation produced the highest volumetric
accuracy, while default augmentations yielded superior boundary precision
(achieving a state-of-the-art MASD of 5.46 mm and HD95 of 17.33 mm for Task 1).
For our final submission, we exploited this finding by constructing custom,
heterogeneous ensembles of specialist models, essentially creating a mix of
experts. This metric-aware ensembling strategy proved highly effective,
achieving a top cross-validation Tumor Dice score of 0.661 for Task 1 and 0.523
for Task 2. Our work presents a robust methodology for developing specialized,
high-performance models in the context of limited data and complex medical
imaging tasks (Team MIC-DKFZ).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPT-5在放射肿瘤学领域表现优异，在多项选择题测试中准确率达92.8%，显著超越GPT-4和GPT-3.5，但在真实临床场景中仍需专家监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估GPT-5这一专门针对肿瘤学设计的大型语言模型在放射肿瘤学临床决策支持中的表现，验证其在真实医疗场景中的实用性。

Method: 使用两个互补基准进行评估：1）ACR放射肿瘤学培训考试的300道多选题；2）60个真实放射肿瘤学病例的简短治疗计划生成，由4名认证放射肿瘤学家评估正确性、全面性和幻觉现象。

Result: GPT-5在TXIT测试中准确率92.8%，显著优于GPT-4（78.8%）和GPT-3.5（62.1%）。在病例评估中，正确性评分3.24/4，全面性评分3.59/4，幻觉现象罕见但存在实质性错误。

Conclusion: GPT-5在放射肿瘤学领域表现突出，但生成的临床建议仍需严格的专家监督，在复杂场景中仍有改进空间，不适合完全自主的临床应用。

Abstract: Introduction: Large language models (LLM) have shown great potential in
clinical decision support. GPT-5 is a novel LLM system that has been
specifically marketed towards oncology use.
  Methods: Performance was assessed using two complementary benchmarks: (i) the
ACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (TXIT, 2021), comprising 300
multiple-choice items, and (ii) a curated set of 60 authentic radiation
oncologic vignettes representing diverse disease sites and treatment
indications. For the vignette evaluation, GPT-5 was instructed to generate
concise therapeutic plans. Four board-certified radiation oncologists rated
correctness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations. Inter-rater reliability was
quantified using Fleiss' \k{appa}.
  Results: On the TXIT benchmark, GPT-5 achieved a mean accuracy of 92.8%,
outperforming GPT-4 (78.8%) and GPT-3.5 (62.1%). Domain-specific gains were
most pronounced in Dose and Diagnosis. In the vignette evaluation, GPT-5's
treatment recommendations were rated highly for correctness (mean 3.24/4, 95%
CI: 3.11-3.38) and comprehensiveness (3.59/4, 95% CI: 3.49-3.69).
Hallucinations were rare with no case reaching majority consensus for their
presence. Inter-rater agreement was low (Fleiss' \k{appa} 0.083 for
correctness), reflecting inherent variability in clinical judgment. Errors
clustered in complex scenarios requiring precise trial knowledge or detailed
clinical adaptation.
  Discussion: GPT-5 clearly outperformed prior model variants on the radiation
oncology multiple-choice benchmark. Although GPT-5 exhibited favorable
performance in generating real-world radiation oncology treatment
recommendations, correctness ratings indicate room for further improvement.
While hallucinations were infrequent, the presence of substantive errors
underscores that GPT-5-generated recommendations require rigorous expert
oversight before clinical implementation.

TL;DR: 提出TMUAD三记忆框架，通过文本记忆库、对象级图像记忆库和补丁级记忆库统一检测结构和逻辑异常，在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖精心设计的图像特征提取器和记忆库来捕捉对象间逻辑关系，但正常数据有限且逻辑异常检测困难

Method: 构建三个互补记忆库：1)逻辑感知文本提取器构建的类级文本记忆库；2)保留完整对象轮廓的对象级图像记忆库；3)用于结构异常检测的补丁级记忆库。通过多级检索比较计算异常分数

Result: 在7个公开数据集（工业和医疗领域）上实现了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 通过协作记忆库统一结构和逻辑异常检测是有效的，TMUAD框架在多个领域表现出色

Abstract: Anomaly detection, which aims to identify anomalies deviating from normal
patterns, is challenging due to the limited amount of normal data available.
Unlike most existing unified methods that rely on carefully designed image
feature extractors and memory banks to capture logical relationships between
objects, we introduce a text memory bank to enhance the detection of logical
anomalies. Specifically, we propose a Three-Memory framework for Unified
structural and logical Anomaly Detection (TMUAD). First, we build a class-level
text memory bank for logical anomaly detection by the proposed logic-aware text
extractor, which can capture rich logical descriptions of objects from input
images. Second, we construct an object-level image memory bank that preserves
complete object contours by extracting features from segmented objects. Third,
we employ visual encoders to extract patch-level image features for
constructing a patch-level memory bank for structural anomaly detection. These
three complementary memory banks are used to retrieve and compare normal images
that are most similar to the query image, compute anomaly scores at multiple
levels, and fuse them into a final anomaly score. By unifying structural and
logical anomaly detection through collaborative memory banks, TMUAD achieves
state-of-the-art performance across seven publicly available datasets involving
industrial and medical domains. The model and code are available at
https://github.com/SIA-IDE/TMUAD.

TL;DR: VoCap是一个灵活的视频模型，能够处理视频和多种模态提示（文本、框或掩码），生成时空掩码和对应的物体中心描述，同时解决了可提示视频物体分割、参考表达分割和物体描述生成任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频理解需要细粒度定位掩码和详细语义属性，但获取此类数据既繁琐又昂贵，因此需要开发能够同时处理多种视频理解任务的模型。

Method: 提出VoCap模型，通过预处理带有真实掩码的视频来突出感兴趣物体，使用大型视觉语言模型生成伪物体描述，构建SAV-Caption数据集，并在多个图像和视频数据集上进行大规模训练。

Result: 在参考表达视频物体分割任务上达到最先进水平，在半监督视频物体分割任务上具有竞争力，并为视频物体描述建立了基准。

Conclusion: VoCap模型成功解决了多种视频理解任务，通过创新的数据标注方法和大规模训练，在多个基准测试中表现出色，相关数据集将公开提供。

Abstract: Understanding objects in videos in terms of fine-grained localization masks
and detailed semantic properties is a fundamental task in video understanding.
In this paper, we propose VoCap, a flexible video model that consumes a video
and a prompt of various modalities (text, box or mask), and produces a
spatio-temporal masklet with a corresponding object-centric caption. As such
our model addresses simultaneously the tasks of promptable video object
segmentation, referring expression segmentation, and object captioning. Since
obtaining data for this task is tedious and expensive, we propose to annotate
an existing large-scale segmentation dataset (SAV) with pseudo object captions.
We do so by preprocessing videos with their ground-truth masks to highlight the
object of interest and feed this to a large Vision Language Model (VLM). For an
unbiased evaluation, we collect manual annotations on the validation set. We
call the resulting dataset SAV-Caption. We train our VoCap model at scale on a
SAV-Caption together with a mix of other image and video datasets. Our model
yields state-of-the-art results on referring expression video object
segmentation, is competitive on semi-supervised video object segmentation, and
establishes a benchmark for video object captioning. Our dataset will be made
available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/vocap.

TL;DR: 本文提出将场景识别中的动词分类重新定义为单正例多标签学习问题，通过图神经网络和对抗训练方法，在保持传统指标竞争力的同时显著提升多标签性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将动词分类视为单标签问题，但视觉事件识别存在固有歧义性，同一图像可能被多个动词类别合理描述，需要多标签处理。

Method: 提出单正例多标签学习(SPMLL)框架，设计Graph Enhanced Verb MLP模型，结合图神经网络捕捉标签相关性和对抗训练优化决策边界。

Result: 在真实数据集上实验显示，方法在多标签平均精度(MAP)上提升超过3%，同时在传统top-1和top-5准确率指标上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 动词分类本质上是多标签问题，提出的SPMLL框架和GE-VerbMLP模型有效解决了视觉事件识别中的语义重叠问题，为场景识别提供了新的多标签评估基准。

Abstract: Context recognition (SR) is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims
to extract structured semantic summaries from images by identifying key events
and their associated entities. Specifically, given an input image, the model
must first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify
the participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling),
and finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization).
Existing methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we
show through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address
the inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories
may reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key
contributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb
classification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous
semantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of
fully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to
reformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning
(SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a
comprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully
designed to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To
address the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb
Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to
capture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision
boundaries. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach
achieves more than 3\% MAP improvement while remaining competitive on
traditional top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics.

TL;DR: DriveQA是一个全面的开源文本和视觉基准测试，用于评估LLM和MLLM在驾驶知识测试中的表现，发现现有模型在数值推理、复杂路权场景等方面存在显著弱点，但通过微调和预训练可以显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶基准测试主要关注空间和视觉问答任务，但缺乏对交通规则、标志和路权原则的全面理解。人类驾驶员需要识别现实数据集中罕见的边缘案例，因此需要构建一个全面的驾驶知识测试基准。

Method: 提出了DriveQA基准测试，包含文本和视觉版本(DriveQA-V)，涵盖交通法规和场景的各个方面。通过实验评估最先进的LLM和MLLM模型，并进行微调和预训练研究。

Result: 1) 现有模型在基础交通规则上表现良好，但在数值推理、复杂路权场景、交通标志变体和空间布局方面存在显著弱点；2) 在DriveQA上微调可提高多个类别的准确性；3) DriveQA-V揭示了模型对环境因素的敏感性；4) 预训练可提升下游驾驶任务性能。

Conclusion: DriveQA为评估驾驶AI系统提供了全面基准，证明了通过专门的训练可以显著提升模型对交通知识的理解和泛化能力，对自动驾驶系统的发展具有重要意义。

Abstract: If a Large Language Model (LLM) were to take a driving knowledge test today,
would it pass? Beyond standard spatial and visual question-answering (QA) tasks
on current autonomous driving benchmarks, driving knowledge tests require a
complete understanding of all traffic rules, signage, and right-of-way
principles. To pass this test, human drivers must discern various edge cases
that rarely appear in real-world datasets. In this work, we present DriveQA, an
extensive open-source text and vision-based benchmark that exhaustively covers
traffic regulations and scenarios. Through our experiments using DriveQA, we
show that (1) state-of-the-art LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) perform well on
basic traffic rules but exhibit significant weaknesses in numerical reasoning
and complex right-of-way scenarios, traffic sign variations, and spatial
layouts, (2) fine-tuning on DriveQA improves accuracy across multiple
categories, particularly in regulatory sign recognition and intersection
decision-making, (3) controlled variations in DriveQA-V provide insights into
model sensitivity to environmental factors such as lighting, perspective,
distance, and weather conditions, and (4) pretraining on DriveQA enhances
downstream driving task performance, leading to improved results on real-world
datasets such as nuScenes and BDD, while also demonstrating that models can
internalize text and synthetic traffic knowledge to generalize effectively
across downstream QA tasks.

TL;DR: 提出CoBA框架，通过语义三元组分解和选择性修改来生成反偏见数据，解决深度学习模型对虚假相关性的依赖问题，提升模型泛化能力和分布外鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型容易学习训练数据中的虚假相关性，使用非目标特征进行预测，导致性能下降和泛化能力差。需要一种方法来同时处理多种偏见并增强分布外鲁棒性。

Method: 提出CoBA（CounterBias Augmentation）框架：1）将文本分解为主题-谓词-对象三元组；2）选择性修改这些三元组以破坏虚假相关性；3）从调整后的三元组重构文本生成反偏见数据。

Result: 通过大量实验证明，CoBA不仅提高了下游任务性能，还有效减少了偏见并增强了分布外鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CoBA提供了一个通用且鲁棒的解决方案，能够有效应对虚假相关性带来的挑战，为提升模型公平性和泛化能力提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Deep learning models often learn and exploit spurious correlations in
training data, using these non-target features to inform their predictions.
Such reliance leads to performance degradation and poor generalization on
unseen data. To address these limitations, we introduce a more general form of
counterfactual data augmentation, termed counterbias data augmentation, which
simultaneously tackles multiple biases (e.g., gender bias, simplicity bias) and
enhances out-of-distribution robustness. We present CoBA: CounterBias
Augmentation, a unified framework that operates at the semantic triple level:
first decomposing text into subject-predicate-object triples, then selectively
modifying these triples to disrupt spurious correlations. By reconstructing the
text from these adjusted triples, CoBA generates counterbias data that
mitigates spurious patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
CoBA not only improves downstream task performance, but also effectively
reduces biases and strengthens out-of-distribution resilience, offering a
versatile and robust solution to the challenges posed by spurious correlations.

Abstract: A lack of demographic context in existing toxic speech datasets limits our
understanding of how different age groups communicate online. In collaboration
with funk, a German public service content network, this research introduces
the first large-scale German dataset annotated for toxicity and enriched with
platform-provided age estimates. The dataset includes 3,024 human-annotated and
30,024 LLM-annotated anonymized comments from Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube.
To ensure relevance, comments were consolidated using predefined toxic
keywords, resulting in 16.7\% labeled as problematic. The annotation pipeline
combined human expertise with state-of-the-art language models, identifying key
categories such as insults, disinformation, and criticism of broadcasting fees.
The dataset reveals age-based differences in toxic speech patterns, with
younger users favoring expressive language and older users more often engaging
in disinformation and devaluation. This resource provides new opportunities for
studying linguistic variation across demographics and supports the development
of more equitable and age-aware content moderation systems.

Abstract: Cognitive biases, well-studied in humans, can also be observed in LLMs,
affecting their reliability in real-world applications. This paper investigates
the anchoring effect in LLM-driven price negotiations. To this end, we
instructed seller LLM agents to apply the anchoring effect and evaluated
negotiations using not only an objective metric but also a subjective metric.
Experimental results show that LLMs are influenced by the anchoring effect like
humans. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between the anchoring
effect and factors such as reasoning and personality. It was shown that
reasoning models are less prone to the anchoring effect, suggesting that the
long chain of thought mitigates the effect. However, we found no significant
correlation between personality traits and susceptibility to the anchoring
effect. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of cognitive biases
in LLMs and to the realization of safe and responsible application of LLMs in
society.

TL;DR: Percept-V数据集评估MLLM在基本视觉感知任务上的表现，发现随着任务复杂度增加，模型性能显著下降，且不同认知技能难度存在差异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注MLLM在复杂任务（如编码、数学、科学）上的推理能力，但缺乏对基本视觉感知能力的系统评估，特别是在无污染的生成图像上

Method: 创建包含7200张程序生成图像的Percept-V数据集，分为30个类别测试不同视觉感知技能组合，并在GPT-4o、Gemini、Claude等先进MLLM和LRM上进行测试

Result: 实验显示MLLM在基本感知任务上表现不佳，随着问题复杂度增加，所有模型性能均显著下降，且不同认知技能的难度存在明显差异

Conclusion: MLLM在复杂任务上表现出色，但在基本视觉感知任务上存在明显短板，需要进一步改进底层视觉理解能力

Abstract: The reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
garnered a lot of attention in recent times, with advances made in frontiers
like coding, mathematics, and science. However, very limited experiments have
been done to assess their performance in simple perception tasks performed over
uncontaminated, generated images containing basic shapes and structures. To
address this issue, the paper introduces a dataset, Percept-V, containing a
total of 7200 program-generated images equally divided into 30 categories, each
testing a combination of visual perception skills. Unlike previously proposed
datasets, Percept-V comprises very basic tasks of varying complexity that test
the perception abilities of MLLMs. This dataset is then tested on
state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude as well as Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) like OpenAI o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 to gauge their
performance. Contrary to the evidence that MLLMs excel in many complex tasks,
our experiments show a significant drop in the models' performance with
increasing problem complexity across all categories. An analysis of the
performances also reveals that the tested MLLMs exhibit a similar trend in
accuracy across categories, testing a particular cognitive skill and find some
skills to be more difficult than others.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学大语言模型在科学研究中发挥着重要作用，但其发展受到科学数据复杂性的制约，需要重新审视模型与数据之间的协同关系。

Method: 采用数据中心的综合分析框架，构建统一的科学数据分类法和科学知识层次模型，系统回顾了270多个预训练/后训练数据集和190多个基准数据集。

Result: 揭示了科学数据具有多模态、跨尺度、领域特定等独特挑战，需要保持领域不变性和支持跨模态推理的表征，评估方法正从静态考试转向过程导向和发现导向的评估。

Conclusion: 提出了向闭环系统的范式转变，基于Sci-LLMs的自主代理能够主动实验、验证并为活的知识库做出贡献，为构建可信赖、持续进化的AI系统提供了路线图。

Abstract: Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) are transforming how knowledge is
represented, integrated, and applied in scientific research, yet their progress
is shaped by the complex nature of scientific data. This survey presents a
comprehensive, data-centric synthesis that reframes the development of Sci-LLMs
as a co-evolution between models and their underlying data substrate. We
formulate a unified taxonomy of scientific data and a hierarchical model of
scientific knowledge, emphasizing the multimodal, cross-scale, and
domain-specific challenges that differentiate scientific corpora from general
natural language processing datasets. We systematically review recent Sci-LLMs,
from general-purpose foundations to specialized models across diverse
scientific disciplines, alongside an extensive analysis of over 270
pre-/post-training datasets, showing why Sci-LLMs pose distinct demands --
heterogeneous, multi-scale, uncertainty-laden corpora that require
representations preserving domain invariance and enabling cross-modal
reasoning. On evaluation, we examine over 190 benchmark datasets and trace a
shift from static exams toward process- and discovery-oriented assessments with
advanced evaluation protocols. These data-centric analyses highlight persistent
issues in scientific data development and discuss emerging solutions involving
semi-automated annotation pipelines and expert validation. Finally, we outline
a paradigm shift toward closed-loop systems where autonomous agents based on
Sci-LLMs actively experiment, validate, and contribute to a living, evolving
knowledge base. Collectively, this work provides a roadmap for building
trustworthy, continually evolving artificial intelligence (AI) systems that
function as a true partner in accelerating scientific discovery.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM评估存在严重标签偏见，Claude标签会提升评分而Gemini标签会降低评分，错误标签可导致排名反转和高达50个百分点的评分变化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型越来越多地被用于评估输出，但其判断可能受到偏见影响，需要研究自我评估和跨模型评估中的偏见问题

Method: 使用ChatGPT、Gemini和Claude三种模型，在无标签、真实标签和两种错误标签条件下，通过整体偏好投票和三个质量维度（连贯性、信息性、简洁性）的百分比评分来评估博客文章

Result: 发现明显的非对称偏见：Claude标签始终提升评分，Gemini标签始终降低评分；错误标签经常导致排名反转，偏好投票变化达50个百分点，质量评分变化达12个百分点；Gemini在真实标签下自评分崩溃，Claude自偏好加剧

Conclusion: 感知到的模型身份会严重扭曲高级判断并微妙影响详细质量评分，强调需要盲评或多模型评估协议来确保LLM基准测试的公平性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate outputs, yet
their judgments may be influenced. This study examines bias in self- and
cross-model evaluations by ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude under four conditions:
no labels, true labels, and two false-label scenarios. Blog posts authored by
each model were evaluated by all three using both overall preference voting and
quality ratings for Coherence, Informativeness, and Conciseness, with all
scores expressed as percentages for direct comparison. Results reveal striking
asymmetries: the "Claude" label consistently boosts scores, while the "Gemini"
label consistently depresses them, regardless of actual content. False labels
frequently reversed rankings, producing shifts of up to 50 percentage points in
preference votes and up to 12 percentage points in converted quality ratings.
Gemini's self-scores collapsed under true labels, while Claude's
self-preference intensified. These findings show that perceived model identity
can heavily distort high-level judgments and subtly influence detailed quality
ratings, underscoring the need for blind or multimodel evaluation protocols to
ensure fairness in LLM benchmarking.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在多轮对话中主动地、智能地收集外部信息的问题，以提升其作为对话代理的效果和适应性。

Method: 基于序贪贝叶斯实验设计框架，迭代地选择最大化预期信息收益的问题，包括设计EIG估计器、不仅依靠上下文更新条件化、以及有针对性的查询建议策略。

Result: 在20问题游戏和用户偏好推断等广泛测试中，BED-LLM较直接提示和其他适应性设计策略实现了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: BED-LLM提供了一种通用的方法，能够有效提升大语言模型在多轮对话中主动收集信息的能力，为构建更智能的对话代理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a general-purpose approach for improving the ability of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently and adaptively gather information from
a user or other external source using the framework of sequential Bayesian
experimental design (BED). This enables LLMs to act as effective multi-turn
conversational agents and interactively interface with external environments.
Our approach, which we call BED-LLM (Bayesian Experimental Design with Large
Language Models), is based on iteratively choosing questions or queries that
maximize the expected information gain (EIG) about the task of interest given
the responses gathered previously. We show how this EIG can be formulated in a
principled way using a probabilistic model derived from the LLM's belief
distribution and provide detailed insights into key decisions in its
construction. Further key to the success of BED-LLM are a number of specific
innovations, such as a carefully designed estimator for the EIG, not solely
relying on in-context updates for conditioning on previous responses, and a
targeted strategy for proposing candidate queries. We find that BED-LLM
achieves substantial gains in performance across a wide range of tests based on
the 20-questions game and using the LLM to actively infer user preferences,
compared to direct prompting of the LLM and other adaptive design strategies.

Motivation: 传统HFACS分析方法存在扩展性和一致性问题，需要更高效自动化方案来提升航空安全分析能力

Method: 使用强化学习组相对策略优化(GRPO)策略微调Llama-3.1 8B模型，结合多组件奖励系统和合成数据生成技术

Result: 模型性能显著提升，精确匹配准确率提高350%（从0.04到0.18），部分匹配准确率达0.88，超越GPT-5-mini和Gemini-2.5等领先模型

Conclusion: 领域优化的小型模型能够提供更高效、更精准的安全分析方案，适合在资源受限边缘设备上部署

Abstract: Analyzing the human factors behind aviation accidents is crucial for
preventing future incidents, yet traditional methods using the Human Factors
Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) are limited by scalability and
consistency. To address this, we introduce an automated HFACS classification
framework for aviation safety analysis that utilizes Reinforcement Learning
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune a Llama-3.1 8B
language model. Our approach incorporates a multi-component reward system
tailored for aviation safety analysis and integrates synthetic data generation
to overcome class imbalance in accident datasets. The resulting GRPO-optimized
model achieved noticeable performance gains, including a 350% increase in exact
match accuracy (from 0.0400 to 0.1800) and an improved partial match accuracy
of 0.8800. Significantly, our specialized model outperforms state-of-the-art
LLMs (Large Language Models), including GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-fiash, on key
metrics. This research also proposes exact match accuracy in multi-label HFACS
classification problem as a new benchmarking methodology to evaluate the
advanced reasoning capabilities of language models. Ultimately, our work
validates that smaller, domain-optimized models can provide a computationally
efficient and better solution for critical safety analysis. This approach makes
powerful, low-latency deployment on resource-constrained edge devices feasible.

TL;DR: 提出基于像素的生成语言模型，通过将单词渲染为图像来解决自回归语言模型对拼写攻击的脆弱性问题，增强多语言文本处理的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语言模型容易受到多语言字母拼写攻击，导致性能显著下降，这主要源于子词分词器及其嵌入的词汇表外问题。

Method: 用基于像素的表征替代基于文本的嵌入，将单词渲染为单个图像，构建像素级生成语言模型。

Result: 在多语言LAMBADA数据集、WMT24数据集和SST-2基准测试中验证了该方法对拼写噪声的鲁棒性和在多语言环境中的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于像素的表征方法能够有效提升语言模型对拼写攻击的抵抗力，并具有良好的多语言文本兼容性。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models are vulnerable to orthographic attacks, where
input text is perturbed with characters from multilingual alphabets, leading to
substantial performance degradation. This vulnerability primarily stems from
the out-of-vocabulary issue inherent in subword tokenizers and their
embeddings. To address this limitation, we propose a pixel-based generative
language model that replaces the text-based embeddings with pixel-based
representations by rendering words as individual images. This design provides
stronger robustness to noisy inputs, while an extension of compatibility to
multilingual text across diverse writing systems. We evaluate the proposed
method on the multilingual LAMBADA dataset, WMT24 dataset and the SST-2
benchmark, demonstrating both its resilience to orthographic noise and its
effectiveness in multilingual settings.

TL;DR: 语音模型中未观察到人类语言获得的关键期效应，反而显示出不同的学习模式


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究自监督语音模型是否也会呈现出人类语言获得中的关键期效应（Critical Period effects），即随着L2更迟接触和L1更晚停止接触而产生的学习困难和语言保持问题

Method: 训练不同L2开始时间和L1结束时间的自监督语音模型，使用儿童指向语音数据，评估其音素辨别性能

Result: 语音模型没有显示出明显的关键期效应；反而迟接触L2的模型在L2上表现更好，迟停止L1接触的模型会忘记L1

Conclusion: 自监督语音模型的语音学习机制与人类语言获得存在本质差异，不具有相同的关键期效应

Abstract: This paper investigates whether the Critical Period (CP) effects in human
language acquisition are observed in self-supervised speech models (S3Ms). CP
effects refer to greater difficulty in acquiring a second language (L2) with
delayed L2 exposure onset, and greater retention of their first language (L1)
with delayed L1 exposure offset. While previous work has studied these effects
using textual language models, their presence in speech models remains
underexplored despite the central role of spoken language in human language
acquisition. We train S3Ms with varying L2 training onsets and L1 training
offsets on child-directed speech and evaluate their phone discrimination
performance. We find that S3Ms do not exhibit clear evidence of either CP
effects in terms of phonological acquisition. Notably, models with delayed L2
exposure onset tend to perform better on L2 and delayed L1 exposure offset
leads to L1 forgetting.

Result: 实验显示方法实现高达3倍的速度提升，同时保持AUROC性能不下降

Conclusion: DMP能有效提升自一致性方法的效率，适用于多种模型、数据集和解码策略，有望扩展到对齐和推理任务

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in both
research and real-world applications, but they still struggle with
hallucination. Existing hallucination detection methods often perform poorly on
sentence-level generation or rely heavily on domain-specific knowledge. While
self-consistency approaches help address these limitations, they incur high
computational costs due to repeated generation. In this paper, we conduct the
first study on identifying redundancy in self-consistency methods, manifested
as shared prefix tokens across generations, and observe that non-exact-answer
tokens contribute minimally to the semantic content. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel Decoding Memory Pipeline (DMP) that accelerates generation
through selective inference and annealed decoding. Being orthogonal to the
model, dataset, decoding strategy, and self-consistency baseline, our DMP
consistently improves the efficiency of multi-response generation and holds
promise for extension to alignment and reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments
show that our method achieves up to a 3x speedup without sacrificing AUROC
performance.

TL;DR: 本文通过"正态性"概念重新审视图灵测试，认为图灵测试评估的是平均/正常人类智能而非卓越智能，需要机器像普通人一样犯错。图灵测试是统计测试，由陪审团而非单一法官评估。ChatGPT等大语言模型追求卓越智能而非正常智能，因此难以通过真正的图灵测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视图灵测试的理论基础，探讨"正态性"概念在图灵测试中的核心作用，挑战当前以大语言模型为代表的人工智能发展路径。

Method: 概念分析方法，从统计学角度解读图灵测试中的"平均人类询问者"概念，分析正常/平均智能与卓越智能的区别。

Result: 提出图灵测试本质上是评估正常智能的统计测试，需要机器表现出人类般的缺陷；指出当前大语言模型追求的是人工聪明度(artificial smartness)而非真正的人工智能。

Conclusion: 图灵测试能否贡献对人类认知的理解，取决于人类心智是否可简化为平均心智，这超出了图灵测试本身，质疑了其所依赖的正态范式概念基础。

Abstract: This paper proposes to revisit the Turing test through the concept of
normality. Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the
normal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense
of the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two
ways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather
than exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test
requires building machines that "make mistakes" and display imperfect behavior
just like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a
statistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a
single "average" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As
such, the notion of "average human interrogator" that Turing talks about in his
original paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical
abstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of
multiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of
normal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average
judgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First,
it argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the
Turing test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than
normal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it
proposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per
se. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can
contribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether
the human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which
largely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual
underpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to.

summarization evaluation. Based on experiments conducted across six
representative metrics ranging from classical approaches like ROUGE to recent
LLM-based methods (G-Eval, SEval-Ex), we highlight significant discrepancies
between reported performances in the literature and those observed in our
experimental setting. We introduce a unified, open-source framework, applied to
the SummEval dataset and designed to support fair and transparent comparison of
evaluation metrics. Our results reveal a structural trade-off: metrics with the
highest alignment with human judgments tend to be computationally intensive and
less stable across runs. Beyond comparative analysis, this study highlights key
concerns about relying on LLMs for evaluation, stressing their randomness,
technical dependencies, and limited reproducibility. We advocate for more
robust evaluation protocols including exhaustive documentation and
methodological standardization to ensure greater reliability in automatic
summarization assessment.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个自动化评估框架来测试大型语言模型作为自动评审生成器在检测研究逻辑错误方面的能力，发现逻辑缺陷对模型输出没有显著影响


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs越来越多地被用作完全自动化的评审生成器，需要了解其在检测研究逻辑错误这一核心评审技能方面的具体能力和局限性，以避免对科学完整性造成风险

Method: 开发了一个完全自动化的反事实评估框架，在受控条件下隔离和测试LLMs检测研究逻辑错误的能力，测试了多种ARG方法

Result: 与预期相反，研究发现研究逻辑中的缺陷对LLMs的输出评审没有显著影响

Conclusion: 基于研究结果提出了三个可行的建议，并公开了反事实数据集和评估框架，为未来工作提供指导

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have great potential to accelerate and support
scholarly peer review and are increasingly used as fully automatic review
generators (ARGs). However, potential biases and systematic errors may pose
significant risks to scientific integrity; understanding the specific
capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art ARGs is essential. We focus on
a core reviewing skill that underpins high-quality peer review: detecting
faulty research logic. This involves evaluating the internal consistency
between a paper's results, interpretations, and claims. We present a fully
automated counterfactual evaluation framework that isolates and tests this
skill under controlled conditions. Testing a range of ARG approaches, we find
that, contrary to expectation, flaws in research logic have no significant
effect on their output reviews. Based on our findings, we derive three
actionable recommendations for future work and release our counterfactual
dataset and evaluation framework publicly.

TL;DR: 提出了首个专门评估医疗奖励模型和评判器的基准Med-RewardBench，包含1026个专家标注的多模态医疗案例，覆盖13个器官系统和8个临床科室，在6个关键临床维度上评估32个最先进的多模态大语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗多模态大语言模型在疾病诊断和临床决策中具有重要应用潜力，但需要高度准确、上下文敏感且专业对齐的响应。目前缺乏专门针对医疗场景的奖励模型和评判器评估基准。

Method: 构建Med-RewardBench基准，采用三步严格流程确保高质量评估数据，涵盖6个临床关键维度。评估32个开源、专有和医疗专用模型，并开发基线模型通过微调提升性能。

Result: 评估显示现有模型在输出与专家判断对齐方面面临重大挑战，基线模型通过微调实现了显著性能提升。

Conclusion: Med-RewardBench填补了医疗奖励模型评估的空白，为医疗AI系统的可靠评估提供了重要基准，揭示了当前模型在医疗专业对齐方面的不足。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold significant potential in
medical applications, including disease diagnosis and clinical decision-making.
However, these tasks require highly accurate, context-sensitive, and
professionally aligned responses, making reliable reward models and judges
critical. Despite their importance, medical reward models (MRMs) and judges
remain underexplored, with no dedicated benchmarks addressing clinical
requirements. Existing benchmarks focus on general MLLM capabilities or
evaluate models as solvers, neglecting essential evaluation dimensions like
diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance. To address this, we introduce
Med-RewardBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate MRMs and
judges in medical scenarios. Med-RewardBench features a multimodal dataset
spanning 13 organ systems and 8 clinical departments, with 1,026
expert-annotated cases. A rigorous three-step process ensures high-quality
evaluation data across six clinically critical dimensions. We evaluate 32
state-of-the-art MLLMs, including open-source, proprietary, and
medical-specific models, revealing substantial challenges in aligning outputs
with expert judgment. Additionally, we develop baseline models that demonstrate
substantial performance improvements through fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个解耦连续语义表示模型(DCSRM)，用于从大语言模型的词嵌入中分解出可解释的细粒度语义子维度，并通过脑成像验证其神经合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义维度分析方法通常依赖预定义的粗粒度维度，忽略了更精细的概念区分，需要开发能够揭示语义结构底层子维度的新方法。

Method: 提出DCSRM模型，将大语言模型的词嵌入分解为多个子嵌入，每个编码特定语义信息；使用体素编码模型将这些子维度映射到大脑激活模式。

Result: 识别出一组可解释的语义子维度，发现语义维度按不同原则结构化，极性是驱动分解的关键因素；神经相关性验证了子维度的认知和神经科学合理性。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了更细粒度的可解释语义子维度，有助于理解语言和大脑中意义的组织结构，为概念语义研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Understanding the core dimensions of conceptual semantics is fundamental to
uncovering how meaning is organized in language and the brain. Existing
approaches often rely on predefined semantic dimensions that offer only broad
representations, overlooking finer conceptual distinctions. This paper proposes
a novel framework to investigate the subdimensions underlying coarse-grained
semantic dimensions. Specifically, we introduce a Disentangled Continuous
Semantic Representation Model (DCSRM) that decomposes word embeddings from
large language models into multiple sub-embeddings, each encoding specific
semantic information. Using these sub-embeddings, we identify a set of
interpretable semantic subdimensions. To assess their neural plausibility, we
apply voxel-wise encoding models to map these subdimensions to brain
activation. Our work offers more fine-grained interpretable semantic
subdimensions of conceptual meaning. Further analyses reveal that semantic
dimensions are structured according to distinct principles, with polarity
emerging as a key factor driving their decomposition into subdimensions. The
neural correlates of the identified subdimensions support their cognitive and
neuroscientific plausibility.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大语言模型存在可量化的"意识形态深度"，通过可操纵性和稀疏自编码器分析揭示了不同模型内部政治特征的复杂性和稳定性差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型表现出明显的意识形态倾向，但这些倾向的稳定性和深度尚不清楚。表面响应容易被提示工程操纵，需要探究其是否反映连贯的底层意识形态。

Method: 采用双重方法：1) 通过指令提示和激活引导测量模型的可操纵性；2) 使用稀疏自编码器(SAEs)探测模型内部机制，分析意识形态特征的抽象性和独特性。

Result: 发现可操纵性较低的模型具有更独特和抽象的意识形态特征，某些模型的政治特征数量是相似规模模型的7.3倍。对核心政治特征的靶向消融在"深度"模型中导致跨主题的一致逻辑转变，而在"浅层"模型中仅增加拒绝输出。

Conclusion: 意识形态深度是大语言模型的可量化属性，可操纵性为研究其潜在政治架构提供了有价值的窗口。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated pronounced ideological
leanings, yet the stability and depth of these positions remain poorly
understood. Surface-level responses can often be manipulated through simple
prompt engineering, calling into question whether they reflect a coherent
underlying ideology. This paper investigates the concept of "ideological depth"
in LLMs, defined as the robustness and complexity of their internal political
representations. We employ a dual approach: first, we measure the
"steerability" of two well-known open-source LLMs using instruction prompting
and activation steering. We find that while some models can easily switch
between liberal and conservative viewpoints, others exhibit resistance or an
increased rate of refusal, suggesting a more entrenched ideological structure.
Second, we probe the internal mechanisms of these models using Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs). Preliminary analysis reveals that models with lower
steerability possess more distinct and abstract ideological features. Our
evaluations reveal that one model can contain 7.3x more political features than
another model of similar size. This allows targeted ablation of a core
political feature in an ideologically "deep" model, leading to consistent,
logical shifts in its reasoning across related topics, whereas the same
intervention in a "shallow" model results in an increase in refusal outputs.
Our findings suggest that ideological depth is a quantifiable property of LLMs
and that steerability serves as a valuable window into their latent political
architecture.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出两种AI驱动的奖励策略（基于偏好模型的RLAIF和基于原则指导的LLM-as-a-Judge），在7B参数的小型语言模型上显著提升了中文问候语生成的创造力，其中原则指导方法在生成质量、训练效率和减少人工标注依赖方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然具有出色的创意写作能力，但计算需求巨大难以广泛应用。增强小型语言模型是可行替代方案，但现有方法如监督微调缺乏新颖性，人类反馈强化学习成本高昂。

Method: 1) 基于多智能体拒绝采样框架训练的偏好模型提供奖励信号；2) 通过对抗训练和反思机制优化的原则指导LLM-as-a-Judge直接提供奖励。两种方法均在RLAIF框架下应用于7B参数SLM的中文问候语生成。

Result: 两种方法都显著超越了基线模型的创意输出，其中原则指导的LLM-as-a-Judge方法在生成质量上表现更优，同时具有更高的训练效率和更低的人工标注数据依赖。自动化评估方法与人类判断高度一致。

Conclusion: 原则指导的LLM-as-a-Judge方法为创意小型语言模型提供了一条更可扩展和有效的路径，在减少人工标注依赖的同时实现了更好的创意写作性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable creative writing
capabilities, yet their substantial computational demands hinder widespread
use. Enhancing Small Language Models (SLMs) offers a promising alternative, but
current methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) struggle with novelty, and
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is costly. This paper
explores two distinct AI-driven reward strategies within a Reinforcement
Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to ignite the creative writing of a
7B-parameter SLM, specifically for generating Chinese greetings. The first
strategy employs a RM trained on high-quality preference data curated by a
novel multi-agent rejection sampling framework designed for creative tasks. The
second, more novel strategy utilizes a principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge, whose
reward function is optimized via an adversarial training scheme with a
reflection mechanism, to directly provide reward signals. Comprehensive
experiments reveal that while both approaches significantly enhance creative
output over baselines, the principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge demonstrably yields
superior generation quality. Furthermore, it offers notable advantages in
training efficiency and reduced dependency on human-annotated data, presenting
a more scalable and effective path towards creative SLMs. Our automated
evaluation methods also exhibit strong alignment with human judgments. Our code

Conclusion: 提出的自动分类器选择方法能够有效提高伪新闻检测集成学习的性能，通过层次聚类咄组合性能评估确保了模型的多样性咄通用性

Abstract: Psychological biases, such as confirmation bias, make individuals
particularly vulnerable to believing and spreading fake news on social media,
leading to significant consequences in domains such as public health and
politics. Machine learning-based fact-checking systems have been widely studied
to mitigate this problem. Among them, ensemble methods are particularly
effective in combining multiple classifiers to improve robustness. However,
their performance heavily depends on the diversity of the constituent
classifiers-selecting genuinely diverse models remains a key challenge,
especially when models tend to learn redundant patterns. In this work, we
propose a novel automatic classifier selection approach that prioritizes
diversity, also extended by performance. The method first computes pairwise
diversity between classifiers and applies hierarchical clustering to organize
them into groups at different levels of granularity. A HierarchySelect then
explores these hierarchical levels to select one pool of classifiers per level,
each representing a distinct intra-pool diversity. The most diverse pool is
identified and selected for ensemble construction from these. The selection
process incorporates an evaluation metric reflecting each classifiers's
performance to ensure the ensemble also generalises well. We conduct
experiments with 40 heterogeneous classifiers across six datasets from
different application domains and with varying numbers of classes. Our method
is compared against the Elbow heuristic and state-of-the-art baselines. Results
show that our approach achieves the highest accuracy on two of six datasets.

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法持续提升种子数据质量，平均提高LLM准确率7.15%，同时保持原始数据集规模

Conclusion: 该工作通过数据和模型的动态人机协同演化，为可持续LLM训练建立了新范式

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Large Language Models (LLM) fundamentally rely
on high-quality training data. While data selection and data synthesis are two
common strategies to improve data quality, existing approaches often face
limitations in static dataset curation that fail to adapt to evolving model
capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed
dynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and
context-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off
filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop
optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively
identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns
(complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores
(quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal
samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic
integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model
capability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our \method consistently enhances the quality of
seed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on
average while maintaining the original dataset scale. This work establishes a
new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution
of data and models. Our datasets, models, and code are coming soon.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly integrate into everyday
workflows, where users shape outcomes through multi-turn collaboration, a
critical question emerges: do users with different personality traits
systematically prefer certain LLMs over others? We conducted a study with 32
participants evenly distributed across four Keirsey personality types,
evaluating their interactions with GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 across four
collaborative tasks: data analysis, creative writing, information retrieval,
and writing assistance. Results revealed significant personality-driven
preferences: Rationals strongly preferred GPT-4, particularly for goal-oriented
tasks, while idealists favored Claude 3.5, especially for creative and
analytical tasks. Other personality types showed task-dependent preferences.
Sentiment analysis of qualitative feedback confirmed these patterns. Notably,
aggregate helpfulness ratings were similar across models, showing how
personality-based analysis reveals LLM differences that traditional evaluations
miss.

Abstract: Misleading visualizations are a potent driver of misinformation on social
media and the web. By violating chart design principles, they distort data and
lead readers to draw inaccurate conclusions. Prior work has shown that both
humans and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are frequently deceived by
such visualizations. Automatically detecting misleading visualizations and
identifying the specific design rules they violate could help protect readers
and reduce the spread of misinformation. However, the training and evaluation
of AI models has been limited by the absence of large, diverse, and openly
available datasets. In this work, we introduce Misviz, a benchmark of 2,604
real-world visualizations annotated with 12 types of misleaders. To support
model training, we also release Misviz-synth, a synthetic dataset of 81,814
visualizations generated using Matplotlib and based on real-world data tables.
We perform a comprehensive evaluation on both datasets using state-of-the-art
MLLMs, rule-based systems, and fine-tuned classifiers. Our results reveal that
the task remains highly challenging. We release Misviz, Misviz-synth, and the
accompanying code.

Motivation: 解决监督式精细调整(SFT)中存在的"泵泵板现象"，即不区分地更新参数导致某些任务提升但以其他任务为代价的问题。

Method: 1) 独立精细调整每个任务以识别核心参数区域 2) 根据区域重叠分组任务 3) 使用参数融合技术：核心参数直接移植，非核心参数通过球面线性插值(SLERP)融合 4) 轻量级管线化SFT训练阶段

Result: 在多个公开测试集上的实验表明，该方法显著缓解了任务干扰和恐怖遗忘问题，持续超越传统的多任务和多阶段精细调整方法。

Conclusion: CPI-FT框架通过核心参数隔离和融合技术，为解决大语言模型在多任务精细调整中的性能减退问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a pivotal approach to adapting large language
models (LLMs) for downstream tasks; however, performance often suffers from the
``seesaw phenomenon'', where indiscriminate parameter updates yield progress on
certain tasks at the expense of others. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel \emph{Core Parameter Isolation Fine-Tuning} (CPI-FT) framework.
Specifically, we first independently fine-tune the LLM on each task to identify
its core parameter regions by quantifying parameter update magnitudes. Tasks
with similar core regions are then grouped based on region overlap, forming
clusters for joint modeling. We further introduce a parameter fusion technique:
for each task, core parameters from its individually fine-tuned model are
directly transplanted into a unified backbone, while non-core parameters from
different tasks are smoothly integrated via Spherical Linear Interpolation
(SLERP), mitigating destructive interference. A lightweight, pipelined SFT
training phase using mixed-task data is subsequently employed, while freezing
core regions from prior tasks to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Extensive
experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
significantly alleviates task interference and forgetting, consistently
outperforming vanilla multi-task and multi-stage fine-tuning baselines.

TL;DR: 本文提出了MENTAT方法，针对推理密集型回归任务(RiR)，通过批量反射提示优化和神经集成学习，在有限数据和计算资源下显著提升大语言模型的数值推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在推理密集型回归任务（如基于文本的数值属性推断）中表现不佳，特别是在训练数据和计算资源有限的情况下，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 提出MENTAT方法，结合批量反射提示优化和神经集成学习，通过优化提示策略和集成多个模型来提升推理性能。

Result: MENTAT方法相比冻结LLM和微调Transformer编码器基线，性能提升高达65%，在三个现实问题基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: MENTAT为推理密集型回归任务提供了简单有效的解决方案，但该领域仍有很大改进空间，需要未来进一步研究。

Abstract: AI researchers and practitioners increasingly apply large language models
(LLMs) to what we call reasoning-intensive regression (RiR), i.e. deducing
subtle numerical properties from text. Unlike standard language regression
tasks, e.g. for sentiment or similarity, RiR often appears instead in ad-hoc
problems like rubric-based scoring or domain-specific retrieval, where much
deeper analysis of text is required while only limited task-specific training
data and computation are available. We cast three realistic problems as RiR
tasks to establish an initial benchmark, and use that to test our hypothesis
that prompting frozen LLMs and finetuning Transformer encoders via gradient
descent will both often struggle in RiR. We then propose MENTAT, a simple and
lightweight method that combines batch-reflective prompt optimization with
neural ensemble learning. MENTAT achieves up to 65% improvement over both
baselines, though substantial room remains for future advances in RiR.

TL;DR: PiCSAR是一种无需训练的评分方法，通过联合对数似然对推理链和最终答案进行评分，在数学推理任务中显著优于现有方法，使用更少样本获得更好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Best-of-n采样通过生成多个候选解并选择奖励最高的方案来提升大语言模型的准确性，但关键挑战在于如何设计评分函数来识别正确的推理链而无需真实答案。

Method: 提出概率置信选择与排序(PiCSAR)方法，使用推理过程和最终答案的联合对数似然来评分每个候选生成，该方法自然分解为推理置信度和答案置信度。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中取得显著提升(MATH500 +10.18, AIME2025 +9.81)，在20次比较中的16次以至少2倍更少的样本优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 分析表明正确的推理链展现出显著更高的推理和答案置信度，验证了PiCSAR方法的有效性。

Abstract: Best-of-n sampling improves the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) and
large reasoning models (LRMs) by generating multiple candidate solutions and
selecting the one with the highest reward. The key challenge for reasoning
tasks is designing a scoring function that can identify correct reasoning
chains without access to ground-truth answers. We propose Probabilistic
Confidence Selection And Ranking (PiCSAR): a simple, training-free method that
scores each candidate generation using the joint log-likelihood of the
reasoning and final answer. The joint log-likelihood of the reasoning and final
answer naturally decomposes into reasoning confidence and answer confidence.
PiCSAR achieves substantial gains across diverse benchmarks (+10.18 on MATH500,
+9.81 on AIME2025), outperforming baselines with at least 2x fewer samples in
16 out of 20 comparisons. Our analysis reveals that correct reasoning chains
exhibit significantly higher reasoning and answer confidence, justifying the
effectiveness of PiCSAR.

TL;DR: 本文研究了拍卖环境中多臂老虎机算法的最优探索策略，针对新广告商的质量评分冷启动问题，提出了定制化的探索方法，显著提升了平台收入和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决赞助搜索拍卖中新广告商质量评分设置的冷启动问题，平台使用多臂老虎机算法但缺乏最优探索策略的研究。

Method: 利用亚洲领先移动应用商店的数据，分析Thompson Sampling算法在第二价格拍卖中的表现，提出根据关键词特征调整探索水平的定制化策略。

Result: 实证研究表明拍卖-老虎机组合问题与经典老虎机问题存在显著差异，定制化探索策略在收入和效率指标上都带来了显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过优化探索策略，平台可以同时实现收入和效率的帕累托改进，为实际运营提供了可行的政策建议。

Abstract: Sponsored search positions are typically allocated through real-time
auctions, where the outcomes depend on advertisers' quality-adjusted bids - the
product of their bids and quality scores. Although quality scoring helps
promote ads with higher conversion outcomes, setting these scores for new
advertisers in any given market is challenging, leading to the cold-start
problem. To address this, platforms incorporate multi-armed bandit algorithms
in auctions to balance exploration and exploitation. However, little is known
about the optimal exploration strategies in such auction environments. We
utilize data from a leading Asian mobile app store that places sponsored ads
for keywords. The platform employs a Thompson Sampling algorithm within a
second-price auction to learn quality scores and allocate a single sponsored
position for each keyword. We empirically quantify the gains from optimizing
exploration under this combined auction-bandit model and show that this problem
differs substantially from the canonical bandit problem. Drawing on these
empirical insights, we propose a customized exploration strategy in which the
platform adjusts the exploration levels for each keyword according to its
characteristics. We derive the Pareto frontier for revenue and efficiency and
provide actionable policies, demonstrating substantial gains for the platform
on both metrics when using a tailored exploration approach.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate a steering problem in a mediator-augmented
two-player normal-form game, where the mediator aims to guide players toward a
specific action profile through information and incentive design. We first
characterize the games for which successful steering is possible. Moreover, we
establish that steering players to any desired action profile is not always
achievable with information design alone, nor when accompanied with sublinear
payment schemes. Consequently, we derive a lower bound on the constant payments
required per round to achieve this goal. To address these limitations incurred
with information design, we introduce an augmented approach that involves a
one-shot information design phase before the start of the repeated game,
transforming the prior interaction into a Stackelberg game. Finally, we
theoretically demonstrate that this approach improves the convergence rate of
players' action profiles to the target point by a constant factor with high
probability, and support it with empirical results.

Abstract: Short text clustering is a known use case in the text analytics community.
When the structure and content falls in the natural language domain e.g.
Twitter posts or instant messages, then natural language techniques can be
used, provided texts are of sufficient length to allow for use of (pre)trained
models to extract meaningful information, such as part-of-speech or topic
annotations. However, natural language models are not suitable for clustering
transaction counterparties, as they are found in bank payment messaging
systems, such as SWIFT. The manually typed tags are typically physical or legal
entity details, which lack sentence structure, while containing all the
variations and noise that manual entry introduces. This leaves a gap in an
investigator or counter-fraud professional's toolset when looking to augment
their knowledge of payment flow originator and beneficiary entities and trace
funds and assets. A gap that vendors traditionally try to close with fuzzy
matching tools. With these considerations in mind, we are proposing a hybrid
string similarity, topic modelling, hierarchical clustering and rule-based
pipeline to facilitate clustering of transaction counterparties, also catering
for unknown number of expected clusters. We are also devising metrics to
supplement the evaluation of the approach, based on the well-known measures of
precision and recall. Testing on a real-life labelled dataset demonstrates
significantly improved performance over a baseline rule-based ('keyword')
approach. The approach retains most of the interpretability found in rule-based
systems, as the former adds an additional level of cluster refinement to the
latter. The resulting workflow reduces the need for manual review. When only a
subset of the population needs to be investigated, such as in sanctions
investigations, the approach allows for better control of the risks of missing
entity variations.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) marks a fundamental shift in how artificial
intelligence is applied in healthcare. Instead of merely predicting outcomes,
RL actively decides interventions with long term goals. Unlike traditional
models that operate on fixed associations, RL systems learn through trial,
feedback, and long-term reward optimization, introducing transformative
possibilities and new risks. From an information fusion lens, healthcare RL
typically integrates multi-source signals such as vitals, labs clinical notes,
imaging and device telemetry using temporal and decision-level mechanisms.
These systems can operate within centralized, federated, or edge architectures
to meet real-time clinical constraints, and naturally span data, features and
decision fusion levels. This survey explore RL's rise in healthcare as more
than a set of tools, rather a shift toward agentive intelligence in clinical
environments. We first structure the landscape of RL techniques including
model-based and model-free methods, offline and batch-constrained approaches,
and emerging strategies for reward specification and uncertainty calibration
through the lens of healthcare constraints. We then comprehensively analyze RL
applications spanning critical care, chronic disease, mental health,
diagnostics, and robotic assistance, identifying their trends, gaps, and
translational bottlenecks. In contrast to prior reviews, we critically analyze
RL's ethical, deployment, and reward design challenges, and synthesize lessons
for safe, human-aligned policy learning. This paper serves as both a a
technical roadmap and a critical reflection of RL's emerging transformative
role in healthcare AI not as prediction machinery, but as agentive clinical
intelligence.

TL;DR: 提出了一个多粒度EEG情感分类框架，在GAMEEMO数据集上使用LSTM-GRU模型在二分类、多分类和多标签情感分类任务中均取得最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG情感识别研究大多局限于二分类或特定被试分类，限制了在真实情感计算系统中的泛化能力和部署应用。

Method: 采用结构化预处理策略（时间窗口分割、混合统计和频域特征提取、z-score标准化），构建多粒度情感标签（二分类、多分类、多标签），评估多种机器学习模型和深度学习架构。

Result: LSTM-GRU模型表现最佳，在二分类任务中F1-score达0.932，在多分类和多标签分类中准确率分别为94.5%和90.6%。

Conclusion: 该多粒度框架为EEG情感识别提供了统一的解决方案，LSTM-GRU架构在处理时序EEG信号方面表现出色，具有很好的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in EEG-based emotion recognition have shown promising
outcomes using both deep learning and classical machine learning approaches;
however, most existing studies focus narrowly on binary valence prediction or
subject-specific classification, which limits generalizability and deployment
in real-world affective computing systems. To address this gap, this paper
presents a unified, multigranularity EEG emotion classification framework built
on the GAMEEMO dataset, which consists of 14-channel EEG recordings and
continuous self-reported emotion ratings (boring, horrible, calm, and funny)
from 28 subjects across four emotion-inducing gameplay scenarios. Our pipeline
employs a structured preprocessing strategy that comprises temporal window
segmentation, hybrid statistical and frequency-domain feature extraction, and
z-score normalization to convert raw EEG signals into robust, discriminative
input vectors. Emotion labels are derived and encoded across three
complementary axes: (i) binary valence classification based on the averaged
polarity of positive and negative emotion ratings, and (ii) Multi-class emotion
classification, where the presence of the most affective state is predicted.
(iii) Fine-grained multi-label representation via binning each emotion into 10
ordinal classes. We evaluate a broad spectrum of models, including Random
Forest, XGBoost, and SVM, alongside deep neural architectures such as LSTM,
LSTM-GRU, and CNN-LSTM. Among these, the LSTM-GRU model consistently
outperforms the others, achieving an F1-score of 0.932 in the binary valence
task and 94.5% and 90.6% in both multi-class and Multi-Label emotion
classification.

TL;DR: PVPO是一种通过优势参考锚点和数据预采样增强的高效强化学习方法，解决了无评论家方法依赖组内比较导致的局部最优和高计算成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无评论家强化学习方法（特别是组策略方法）严重依赖策略内的多重采样和比较来估计优势，这容易导致策略陷入局部最优并增加计算成本。

Method: 使用参考模型提前进行rollout，将计算得到的奖励分数作为参考锚点，有效纠正组内比较引入的累积偏差；同时通过参考模型在数据预采样中评估样本难度，选择高增益数据提高训练效率。

Result: 在跨两个领域的九个数据集上的实验表明，PVPO达到了最先进的性能，在多个任务上展现出强大的泛化能力，并在不同规模的模型上表现出可扩展的性能。

Conclusion: PVPO通过优势参考锚点和数据预采样机制，显著降低了rollout次数的依赖，提高了训练效率，同时避免了局部最优问题，在多个任务和模型规模上都表现出优异的性能。

Abstract: Critic-free reinforcement learning methods, particularly group policies, have
attracted considerable attention for their efficiency in complex tasks.
However, these methods rely heavily on multiple sampling and comparisons within
the policy to estimate advantage, which may cause the policy to fall into local
optimum and increase computational cost. To address these issues, we propose
PVPO, an efficient reinforcement learning method enhanced by an advantage
reference anchor and data pre-sampling. Specifically, we use the reference
model to rollout in advance and employ the calculated reward score as a
reference anchor. Our approach effectively corrects the cumulative bias
introduced by intra-group comparisons and significantly reduces reliance on the
number of rollouts. Meanwhile, the reference model can assess sample difficulty
during data pre-sampling, enabling effective selection of high-gain data to
improve training efficiency. Experiments conducted on nine datasets across two
domains demonstrate that PVPO achieves State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) performance. Our
approach not only demonstrates robust generalization across multiple tasks, but
also exhibits scalable performance across models of varying scales.

TL;DR: AdaGram是一种高效的全矩阵自适应梯度优化器，通过快速对称分解和低秩近似来降低计算和内存开销，在保持性能的同时实现更快的收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的对角自适应方法（如Adagrad）无法捕捉参数相关性，而全矩阵方法虽然能建模相关性但计算和内存成本过高，需要一种高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用快速对称分解计算预条件更新方向，并通过矩阵积分器方法保持预条件器的低秩结构，使用秩5或更小的低秩近似。

Result: 在标准机器学习任务上的数值实验表明，AdaGram比对角自适应优化器收敛更快或性能相当。

Conclusion: AdaGram为大规模模型中的自适应优化提供了一个可扩展的解决方案，在低秩近似下实现了优异的性能。

Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods like Adagrad and its variants are widespread in
large-scale optimization. However, their use of diagonal preconditioning
matrices limits the ability to capture parameter correlations. Full-matrix
adaptive methods, approximating the exact Hessian, can model these correlations
and may enable faster convergence. At the same time, their computational and
memory costs are often prohibitive for large-scale models. To address this
limitation, we propose AdaGram, an optimizer that enables efficient full-matrix
adaptive gradient updates. To reduce memory and computational overhead, we
utilize fast symmetric factorization for computing the preconditioned update
direction at each iteration. Additionally, we maintain the low-rank structure
of a preconditioner along the optimization trajectory using matrix integrator
methods. Numerical experiments on standard machine learning tasks show that
AdaGram converges faster or matches the performance of diagonal adaptive
optimizers when using rank five and smaller rank approximations. This
demonstrates AdaGram's potential as a scalable solution for adaptive
optimization in large models.

Abstract: This paper presents a Deep Learning (DL) framework for 48-hour forecasting of
temperature, solar irradiance, and relative humidity to support Model
Predictive Control (MPC) in smart HVAC systems. The approach employs a stacked
Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network with attention, capturing
temporal and cross-feature dependencies by jointly predicting all three
variables. Historical meteorological data (2019-2022) with encoded cyclical
time features were used for training, while 2023 data evaluated generalization.
The model achieved Mean Absolute Errors of 1.3 degrees Celsius (temperature),
31 W/m2 (irradiance), and 6.7 percentage points (humidity), outperforming
state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction and machine learning benchmarks.
Integrated Gradients quantified feature contributions, and attention weights
revealed temporal patterns, enhancing interpretability. By combining
multivariate forecasting, attention-based DL, and explainability, this work
advances data-driven weather prediction. The demonstrated accuracy and
transparency highlight the framework's potential for energy-efficient building
control through reliable short-term meteorological forecasting.

Abstract: The Deep Space Network (DSN) is NASA's largest network of antenna facilities
that generate a large volume of multivariate time-series data. These facilities
contain DSN antennas and transmitters that undergo degradation over long
periods of time, which may cause costly disruptions to the data flow and
threaten the earth-connection of dozens of spacecraft that rely on the Deep
Space Network for their lifeline. The purpose of this study was to experiment
with different methods that would be able to assist JPL engineers with directly
pinpointing anomalies and equipment degradation through collected data, and
continue conducting maintenance and operations of the DSN for future space
missions around our universe. As such, we have researched various machine
learning techniques that can fully reconstruct data through predictive
analysis, and determine anomalous data entries within real-time datasets
through statistical computations and thresholds. On top of the fully trained
and tested machine learning models, we have also integrated the use of a
reinforcement learning subsystem that classifies identified anomalies based on
severity level and a Large Language Model that labels an explanation for each
anomalous data entry, all of which can be improved and fine-tuned over time
through human feedback/input. Specifically, for the DSN transmitters, we have
also implemented a full data pipeline system that connects the data extraction,
parsing, and processing workflow all together as there was no coherent program
or script for performing these tasks before. Using this data pipeline system,
we were able to then also connect the models trained from DSN antenna data,
completing the data workflow for DSN anomaly detection. This was all wrapped
around and further connected by an agentic AI system, where complex reasoning
was utilized to determine the classifications and predictions of anomalous
data.

Method: 构建查询和LLM的共享嵌入空间反映亲和性，基于离线人类偏好数据初始化，通过在线老虎机反馈优化。提出PILOT算法（基于LinUCB的扩展）和在线成本策略（多选择背包问题）。

Result: 开发了能够自适应选择最适合LLM的路由系统，无需对所有查询在所有LLM上进行完整推理，提高了路由效率和资源利用率。

Conclusion: 将LLM路由建模为上下文老虎机问题是有效的，PILOT算法能够实现自适应路由决策，成本策略确保了资源高效使用，为实际应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
but their varying capabilities and costs pose challenges in practical
applications. LLM routing addresses this by dynamically selecting the most
suitable LLM for each query/task. Previous approaches treat this as a
supervised learning problem, assuming complete knowledge of optimal query-LLM
pairings. However, real-world scenarios lack such comprehensive mappings and
face evolving user queries. We thus propose to study LLM routing as a
contextual bandit problem, enabling adaptive decision-making using bandit
feedback without requiring exhaustive inference across all LLMs for all queries
(in contrast to supervised routing). To address this problem, we develop a
shared embedding space for queries and LLMs, where query and LLM embeddings are
aligned to reflect their affinity. This space is initially learned from offline
human preference data and refined through online bandit feedback. We
instantiate this idea through Preference-prior Informed Linucb fOr adaptive
rouTing (PILOT), a novel extension of LinUCB. To handle diverse user budgets
for model routing, we introduce an online cost policy modeled as a multi-choice
knapsack problem, ensuring resource-efficient routing.

Method: 基于表格生成模型倾向于显著过拟合训练分布特定区域的观察，设计生成似然比攻击(Gen-LRA)，无需模型知识或访问，通过评估测试观测对替代模型估计局部似然比的影响来构建攻击

Result: 在涵盖多样化数据集、模型架构和攻击参数的全面基准测试中，Gen-LRA在多个性能指标上始终优于其他生成模型MIA方法

Conclusion: Gen-LRA作为合成数据发布的隐私审计工具非常有效，突显了生成模型过拟合在现实应用中带来的重大隐私风险

Abstract: Auditing the privacy leakage of synthetic data is an important but unresolved
problem. Most existing privacy auditing frameworks for synthetic data rely on
heuristics and unreasonable assumptions to attack the failure modes of
generative models, exhibiting limited capability to describe and detect the
privacy exposure of training data through synthetic data release. In this
paper, we study designing Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) that specifically
exploit the observation that tabular generative models tend to significantly
overfit to certain regions of the training distribution. Here, we propose
Generative Likelihood Ratio Attack (Gen-LRA), a novel, computationally
efficient No-Box MIA that, with no assumption of model knowledge or access,
formulates its attack by evaluating the influence a test observation has in a
surrogate model's estimation of a local likelihood ratio over the synthetic
data. Assessed over a comprehensive benchmark spanning diverse datasets, model
architectures, and attack parameters, we find that Gen-LRA consistently
dominates other MIAs for generative models across multiple performance metrics.
These results underscore Gen-LRA's effectiveness as a privacy auditing tool for
the release of synthetic data, highlighting the significant privacy risks posed
by generative model overfitting in real-world applications.

Result: 正式分析确保了网络动态稳定性，多个时间序列任务实验证明方法优于传统浅层和深度RC方法

Conclusion: DeepResESNs通过殊常连接有效提升了无训练递归网络的长期存储和时间建模能力

Abstract: Echo State Networks (ESNs) are a particular type of untrained Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs) within the Reservoir Computing (RC) framework, popular
for their fast and efficient learning. However, traditional ESNs often struggle
with long-term information processing. In this paper, we introduce a novel
class of deep untrained RNNs based on temporal residual connections, called
Deep Residual Echo State Networks (DeepResESNs). We show that leveraging a
hierarchy of untrained residual recurrent layers significantly boosts memory
capacity and long-term temporal modeling. For the temporal residual
connections, we consider different orthogonal configurations, including
randomly generated and fixed-structure configurations, and we study their
effect on network dynamics. A thorough mathematical analysis outlines necessary
and sufficient conditions to ensure stable dynamics within DeepResESN. Our
experiments on a variety of time series tasks showcase the advantages of the
proposed approach over traditional shallow and deep RC.

Motivation: 现有树集成遗忘方法通常针对特定模型或依赖离散树结构，难以泛化到复杂集成且在大规模数据集上效率低下。

Conclusion: FUTURE为树集成提供了一种有效且高效的遗忘算法，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Tree ensembles are widely recognized for their effectiveness in
classification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse
domains, including bioinformatics, finance, and medical diagnosis. With
increasing emphasis on data privacy and the \textit{right to be forgotten},
several unlearning algorithms have been proposed to enable tree ensembles to
forget sensitive information. However, existing methods are often tailored to a
particular model or rely on the discrete tree structure, making them difficult
to generalize to complex ensembles and inefficient for large-scale datasets. To
address these limitations, we propose FUTURE, a novel unlearning algorithm for
tree ensembles. Specifically, we formulate the problem of forgetting samples as
a gradient-based optimization task. In order to accommodate
non-differentiability of tree ensembles, we adopt the probabilistic model
approximations within the optimization framework. This enables end-to-end
unlearning in an effective and efficient manner. Extensive experiments on
real-world datasets show that FUTURE yields significant and successful
unlearning performance.

*Christopher R. Lee-Jenkins*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过变分原理和复制子动力学，形式化地描述了LLM解码过程中下一个token分布的平滑演化轨迹，证明了温度缩放、top-k和nucleus采样的数学性质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对LLM解码过程的描述多为启发式直觉，缺乏严格的数学框架。本文旨在为softmax归一化步骤提供最小化、自包含的变分原理解释。

Method: 采用约束变分原理和概率单纯形上的离散乘法权重（熵镜像）更新，分析其连续时间极限——复制子流，建立解码过程的动力学模型。

Result: 证明了在固定上下文和温度下，下一个token分布沿单纯形内光滑轨迹收敛到softmax均衡；温度精确对应时间缩放；top-k和nucleus采样保持相同收敛保证。

Conclusion: 为LLM解码提供了严格的数学框架，形式化了"流形遍历"直觉，揭示了温度调节和采样技术的本质，为理解路径依赖得分调整和幻觉行为奠定了基础。

Abstract: Decoding in large language models is often described as scoring tokens and
normalizing with softmax. We give a minimal, self-contained account of this
step as a constrained variational principle on the probability simplex. The
discrete, normalization-respecting ascent is the classical
multiplicative-weights (entropic mirror) update; its continuous-time limit is
the replicator flow. From these ingredients we prove that, for a fixed context
and temperature, the next-token distribution follows a smooth trajectory inside
the simplex and converges to the softmax equilibrium. This formalizes the
common ``manifold traversal'' intuition at the output-distribution level. The
analysis yields precise, practice-facing consequences: temperature acts as an
exact rescaling of time along the same trajectory, while top-k and nucleus
sampling restrict the flow to a face with identical guarantees. We also outline
a controlled account of path-dependent score adjustments and their connection
to loop-like, hallucination-style behavior. We make no claims about training
dynamics or internal representations; those are deferred to future work.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现，大语言模型强化学习中的反直觉现象（如单样本训练效果、不精确奖励信号的有效性等）主要出现在模型与任务高度对齐的情况下，而在更具挑战性的场景中，标准RL方法仍然更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来RL在LLMs应用中出现了许多反直觉现象，但这些现象适用的具体条件尚不明确，需要系统研究其有效性和局限性。

Method: 通过系统全面的实验验证，在不同模型架构和任务领域检验一系列反直觉主张，重点关注模型-任务对齐程度（用pass@k准确率衡量）的影响。

Result: 研究表明，标准RL训练在各种设置下都保持稳健，而许多反直觉结果仅在模型与任务已经高度对齐时才会出现。在更具挑战性的情况下，这些技术无法驱动实质性学习。

Conclusion: 模型-任务对齐是区分RL观察结果的关键因素，反直觉技术只在特定条件下有效，而标准RL方法在更广泛场景中保持可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advances in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to large language
models (LLMs) have led to substantial progress. In particular, a series of
remarkable yet often counterintuitive phenomena have been reported in LLMs,
exhibiting patterns not typically observed in traditional RL settings. For
example, notable claims include that a single training example can match the
performance achieved with an entire dataset, that the reward signal does not
need to be very accurate, and that training solely with negative samples can
match or even surpass sophisticated reward-based methods. However, the precise
conditions under which these observations hold - and, critically, when they
fail - remain unclear. In this work, we identify a key factor that
differentiates RL observations: whether the pretrained model already exhibits
strong Model-Task Alignment, as measured by pass@k accuracy on the evaluated
task. Through a systematic and comprehensive examination of a series of
counterintuitive claims, supported by rigorous experimental validation across
different model architectures and task domains, our findings show that while
standard RL training remains consistently robust across settings, many of these
counterintuitive results arise only when the model and task already exhibit
strong model-task alignment. In contrast, these techniques fail to drive
substantial learning in more challenging regimes, where standard RL methods
remain effective.

TL;DR: 提出基于自组织映射(SOM)和变分自编码器(VAE)的生成式持续学习框架，无需存储原始数据或任务标签，通过SOM单元统计信息生成合成样本进行高效回放。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决持续学习中内存效率低的问题，传统方法需要存储大量原始数据样本，本方法旨在通过生成式回放避免存储原始数据，实现内存高效的持续学习。

Method: 结合SOM和VAE：对高维数据(如CIFAR)在VAE潜在空间进行SOM操作，对低维数据(如MNIST)直接使用SOM。每个SOM单元存储均值、方差和协方差统计量，用于生成合成样本进行回放。

Result: 在标准类增量基准测试中表现优异，与最先进的内存方法竞争，显著优于无内存方法。在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上分别提升近10%和7%的单类增量性能。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了可扩展、无需任务标签、内存高效的持续学习解决方案，同时支持学习过程可视化，并可在训练后作为生成模型使用。

Abstract: This work introduces a novel generative continual learning framework based on
self-organizing maps (SOMs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) to enable
memory-efficient replay, eliminating the need to store raw data samples or task
labels. For high-dimensional input spaces, such as of CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100,
we design a scheme where the SOM operates over the latent space learned by a
VAE, whereas, for lower-dimensional inputs, such as those found in MNIST and
FashionMNIST, the SOM operates in a standalone fashion. Our method stores a
running mean, variance, and covariance for each SOM unit, from which synthetic
samples are then generated during future learning iterations. For the VAE-based
method, generated samples are then fed through the decoder to then be used in
subsequent replay. Experimental results on standard class-incremental
benchmarks show that our approach performs competitively with state-of-the-art
memory-based methods and outperforms memory-free methods, notably improving
over best state-of-the-art single class incremental performance on CIFAR-10 and
CIFAR-100 by nearly $10$\% and $7$\%, respectively. Our methodology further
facilitates easy visualization of the learning process and can also be utilized
as a generative model post-training. Results show our method's capability as a
scalable, task-label-free, and memory-efficient solution for continual
learning.

Motivation: 解决推荐系统中个人数据处理的最小化原则运作化挑战，该原则要求个人数据处理仅限于特定目的所必需

Method: 提出新题问形式，分析各种最小化技术，研究影响其有效性的关键因素

Result: 证明在不导致性能显著损失的情况下，大幅减少推测数据在技术上是可行的

Conclusion: 虽然技术上可行，但数据最小化仍面临实际挑战，其实用性受到技术设置和用户特征的严重影响，使得制定通用的数据"必要性"标准很困难

Abstract: Data minimization is a legal principle requiring personal data processing to
be limited to what is necessary for a specified purpose. Operationalizing this
principle for recommender systems, which rely on extensive personal data,
remains a significant challenge. This paper conducts a feasibility study on
minimizing implicit feedback inference data for such systems. We propose a
novel problem formulation, analyze various minimization techniques, and
investigate key factors influencing their effectiveness. We demonstrate that
substantial inference data reduction is technically feasible without
significant performance loss. However, its practicality is critically
determined by two factors: the technical setting (e.g., performance targets,
choice of model) and user characteristics (e.g., history size, preference
complexity). Thus, while we establish its technical feasibility, we conclude
that data minimization remains practically challenging and its dependence on
the technical and user context makes a universal standard for data `necessity'
difficult to implement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高保真CFD模拟计算成本高，而现有的机器学习代理模型存在异构网络学习方案多样但无法一模型通用的问题。需要利用异构模型的优势来提升预测性能。

Method: 采用混合专家模型（MoE）框架，包含专门的门控网络和三种异构代理模型：DoMINO、X-MeshGraphNet和FigConvNet。门控网络学习空间变化的权重策略，动态结合各专家模型的预测。训练中集成了熵伦正则化项以避免模型失效和促进平衡贡献。

Result: 在DrivAerML数据集上训练和验证，MoE模型在L-2预测误差上显著降低，超过了集成平均值和最准确的单个专家模型，在所有评估物理量上都表现优异。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了MoE框架通过协同结合专业异构的互补优势，能够构建更稳健和准确的复合代理模型，为汽车气动力学设计优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The computational cost associated with high-fidelity CFD simulations remains
a significant bottleneck in the automotive design and optimization cycle. While
ML-based surrogate models have emerged as a promising alternative to accelerate
aerodynamic predictions, the field is characterized by a diverse and rapidly
evolving landscape of specialized neural network architectures, with no single
model demonstrating universal superiority. This paper introduces a novel
meta-learning framework that leverages this architectural diversity as a
strength. We propose a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model that employs a dedicated
gating network to dynamically and optimally combine the predictions from three
heterogeneous, state-of-the-art surrogate models: DoMINO, a decomposable
multi-scale neural operator; X-MeshGraphNet, a scalable multi-scale graph
neural network; and FigConvNet, a factorized implicit global convolution
network. The gating network learns a spatially-variant weighting strategy,
assigning credibility to each expert based on its localized performance in
predicting surface pressure and wall shear stress fields. To prevent model
collapse and encourage balanced expert contributions, we integrate an entropy
regularization term into the training loss function. The entire system is
trained and validated on the DrivAerML dataset, a large-scale, public benchmark
of high-fidelity CFD simulations for automotive aerodynamics. Quantitative
results demonstrate that the MoE model achieves a significant reduction in L-2
prediction error, outperforming not only the ensemble average but also the most
accurate individual expert model across all evaluated physical quantities. This
work establishes the MoE framework as a powerful and effective strategy for
creating more robust and accurate composite surrogate models by synergistically
combining the complementary strengths of specialized architectures.

*Farnoush Rezaei Jafari,Oliver Eberle,Ashkan Khakzar,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Relevance Patching (RelP) 是一种新的机制解释性方法，通过使用层间相关性传播(LRP)系数替代梯度，在保持计算效率的同时比标准属性修补更准确地近似激活修补。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 激活修补是机制解释性的标准方法但计算成本高，属性修补虽然更快但存在噪声和可靠性问题，特别是在深度非线性网络中。

Method: 使用Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP)的传播系数替代属性修补中的局部梯度，保持两次前向传播和一次反向传播的计算效率。

Result: 在GPT-2 Large等模型上，RelP在IOI任务中达到0.956的皮尔逊相关系数，远高于标准属性修补的0.006，且与Integrated Gradients相比具有相当的信度但计算成本更低。

Conclusion: RelP提供了一种计算高效且更准确的激活修补近似方法，在机制解释性任务中表现出优越性能，特别是在深度网络的残差流和MLP输出分析中。

Abstract: Activation patching is a standard method in mechanistic interpretability for
localizing the components of a model responsible for specific behaviors, but it
is computationally expensive to apply at scale. Attribution patching offers a
faster, gradient-based approximation, yet suffers from noise and reduced
reliability in deep, highly non-linear networks. In this work, we introduce
Relevance Patching (RelP), which replaces the local gradients in attribution
patching with propagation coefficients derived from Layer-wise Relevance
Propagation (LRP). LRP propagates the network's output backward through the
layers, redistributing relevance to lower-level components according to local
propagation rules that ensure properties such as relevance conservation or
improved signal-to-noise ratio. Like attribution patching, RelP requires only
two forward passes and one backward pass, maintaining computational efficiency
while improving faithfulness. We validate RelP across a range of models and
tasks, showing that it more accurately approximates activation patching than
standard attribution patching, particularly when analyzing residual stream and
MLP outputs in the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task. For instance, for
MLP outputs in GPT-2 Large, attribution patching achieves a Pearson correlation
of 0.006, whereas RelP reaches 0.956, highlighting the improvement offered by
RelP. Additionally, we compare the faithfulness of sparse feature circuits
identified by RelP and Integrated Gradients (IG), showing that RelP achieves
comparable faithfulness without the extra computational cost associated with
IG.

TL;DR: FedOwen是一个高效的联邦学习框架，使用Owen采样来近似计算Shapley值，通过自适应客户端选择策略在相同评估预算下实现更好的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中准确估计客户端贡献对于公平奖励和选择有用客户端至关重要，但精确计算Shapley值在客户端数量大时计算复杂度呈指数级增长，不可行

Method: 提出FedOwen框架，使用Owen采样近似Shapley值，采用自适应客户端选择策略平衡利用高价值客户端和探索未充分采样的客户端

Result: 在相同评估成本下，FedOwen在非IID基准测试中比最先进基线方法获得高达23%的最终准确率提升

Conclusion: FedOwen通过高效的Shapley值近似和智能客户端选择，显著提高了联邦学习的性能和收敛速度

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aggregates information from multiple clients to train
a shared global model without exposing raw data. Accurately estimating each
client's contribution is essential not just for fair rewards, but for selecting
the most useful clients so the global model converges faster. The Shapley value
is a principled choice, yet exact computation scales exponentially with the
number of clients, making it infeasible for large federations. We propose
FedOwen, an efficient framework that uses Owen sampling to approximate Shapley
values under the same total evaluation budget as existing methods while keeping
the approximation error small. In addition, FedOwen uses an adaptive client
selection strategy that balances exploiting high-value clients with exploring
under-sampled ones, reducing bias and uncovering rare but informative data.
Under a fixed valuation cost, FedOwen achieves up to 23 percent higher final
accuracy within the same number of communication rounds compared to
state-of-the-art baselines on non-IID benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: G&L v1.0提出评估机器学习模型冷启动适应性的新框架，通过测量从头学习过程中的累计错误来量化模型早期学习效率，超越了传统只关注最终准确率的评估方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习评估过度强调最终准确率，忽视了模型从头学习过程中的适应成本（累计错误）。需要一种能够量化模型冷启动适应性的评估框架。

Method: 设计了Guess-and-Learn协议，模型逐步选择未标注实例进行预测、接收真实标签并更新参数，分为在线（逐样本）和批量（延迟）两种更新模式，以及从头训练和预训练两种初始化方式。

Result: 在MNIST和AG News数据集上的实验显示，小模型在早期阶段能以较少错误适应，预训练效果因领域而异，所有当前模型性能都远低于理论最优的oracle参考带。

Conclusion: G&L框架通过量化早期学习的错误成本，补充了传统基准测试，为开发既在极限情况下准确又从第一个样本开始就可靠的模型提供了可复现的评估框架。

Abstract: Evaluation of machine learning models typically emphasizes final accuracy,
overlooking the cost of adaptation: the cumulative errors incurred while
learning from scratch. Guess-and- Learn (G&L) v1.0 addresses this gap by
measuring cold-start adaptability - the total mistakes a model makes while
sequentially labeling an unlabeled dataset. At each step, the learner selects
an instance, predicts its label, receives the ground truth, and updates
parameters under either online (per-sample) or batch (delayed) mode. The
resulting error trajectory exposes adaptation speed, selection quality, and
bias - dynamics invisible to endpoint metrics.
  G&L defines four tracks (Scratch/Pretrained $\times$ Online/Batch) to
disentangle the effects of initialization and update frequency. We formalize
the protocol, relate it to classical mistake-bound theory, and estimate a
heuristic "oracle reference band" for MNIST as a plausibility reference.
Baseline experiments on MNIST and AG News, spanning classical methods
(Perceptron, k-NN), convolutional architectures (CNN, ResNet-50), and
pretrained transformers (ViT-B/16, BERT-base), reveal systematic differences in
early-phase efficiency: smaller models can adapt with fewer initial errors,
while pretraining benefits vary by domain. Across settings, current models
remain well above the oracle band, highlighting an adaptability gap.
  By quantifying the mistake cost of early learning, G&L complements
conventional benchmarks and provides a reproducible framework for developing
learners that are not only accurate in the limit but also reliable from the
first examples.

Motivation: 传统离线训练的异常检测模型在面对数据统计特性随时间变化的概念漂移时性能显著下降，需要开发能够实时适应的解决方案

Method: 构建基于Apache Beam分布式处理框架的端到端系统，使用TimesFm基础模型进行预测式异常检测，采用闭环持续微调机制和LLM-as-a-Judge组件进行语义判断

Result: 在TSB-UAD基准测试中，持续微调模型相比静态预训练基础模型在大多数数据集上提高了ROC AUC分数

Conclusion: CALM框架通过自适应和LLM引导的方法，在动态流式环境中有效维持了高性能异常检测能力

Abstract: The detection of anomalies in non-stationary time-series streams is a
critical but challenging task across numerous industrial and scientific
domains. Traditional models, trained offline, suffer significant performance
degradation when faced with concept drift, where the underlying statistical
properties of the data change over time. This paper introduces CALM
(Continuous, Adaptive, and LLM-Mediated), a novel, end-to-end framework for
real-time anomaly detection designed to address this challenge. CALM is built
on the Apache Beam distributed processing framework and leverages the TimesFm
foundation model for forecasting-based anomaly detection. The framework's
novelty lies in two core contributions. First, it implements a closed-loop,
continuous fine-tuning mechanism that allows the anomaly detection model to
adapt to evolving data patterns in near real-time. Second, it introduces an
LLM-as-a-Judge component, a Large Language Model that provides semantic,
context-aware judgments on detected anomalies to curate a high-quality training
dataset, deciding whether an anomaly represents transient noise or a meaningful
pattern shift. We evaluate CALM on the comprehensive TSB-UAD benchmark. Our
results demonstrate that the continuously fine-tuned model improves the ROC AUC
score in most datasets compared to the static, pre-trained base model,
validating the efficacy of our adaptive, LLM-guided approach to maintaining
high-performance anomaly detection in dynamic streaming environments.

Abstract: Detecting domain shifts in myoelectric activations poses a significant
challenge due to the inherent non-stationarity of electromyography (EMG)
signals. This paper explores the detection of domain shifts using data stream
(DS) learning techniques, focusing on the DB6 dataset from the Ninapro
database. We define domains as distinct time-series segments based on different
subjects and recording sessions, applying Kernel Principal Component Analysis
(KPCA) with a cosine kernel to pre-process and highlight these shifts. By
evaluating multiple drift detection methods such as CUSUM, Page-Hinckley, and
ADWIN, we reveal the limitations of current techniques in achieving high
performance for real-time domain shift detection in EMG signals. Our results
underscore the potential of streaming-based approaches for maintaining stable
EMG decoding models, while highlighting areas for further research to enhance
robustness and accuracy in real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决持续学习中现有方法面临的数据隐私、存储限制和任务差异导致的性能下降问题，避免存储原始样本的需求。

Method: 采用觉醒-睡眠双阶段框架：觉醒阶段快速学习新任务并训练紧凑生成模型；睡眠阶段离线生成伪数据，通过知识蒸馏将新旧知识整合到核心特征提取器中。

Result: 在计算机视觉和自然语言处理基准测试中，MyGO显著缓解了灾难性遗忘，保持了跨任务的高平均准确率，证明了框架的有效性和领域通用性。

Conclusion: MyGO框架通过生成式记忆和离线知识整合，为持续学习提供了隐私保护、存储高效的解决方案，在不同领域都表现出良好的性能。

Abstract: Continual or Lifelong Learning aims to develop models capable of acquiring
new knowledge from a sequence of tasks without catastrophically forgetting what
has been learned before. Existing approaches often rely on storing samples from
previous tasks (experience replay) or employing complex regularization terms to
protect learned weights. However, these methods face challenges related to data
privacy, storage limitations, and performance degradation when tasks are
dissimilar. To address these challenges, we introduce MyGO (Memory Yielding
Generative Offline-consolidation), a novel lifelong learning framework inspired
by the biological wake-sleep cycle. During the "wake" phase, the system rapidly
learns a new task and trains a compact generative model (Generative Memory,
G-mem) to capture its data distribution. During the "sleep" phase, the system
enters an offline state, using all learned G-mem models to generate pseudo-data
("dreams") and consolidate new and old knowledge into a core feature extractor
via knowledge distillation. This approach obviates the need to store any raw
data, retaining only compact generative models, which offers significant
advantages in privacy and storage efficiency. We evaluate MyGO on computer
vision (Split-MNIST) and natural language processing (Split-AG News)
benchmarks, comparing it against a sequential fine-tuning baseline. The results
demonstrate that MyGO significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting and
maintains high average accuracy across tasks, proving the framework's
effectiveness and domain-generality.

TL;DR: VILA是一种新的机器遗忘框架，通过更准确地识别与敏感信息相关的参数并减少计算成本，相比FILA方法实现了100倍的参数效率和40倍的训练速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在生成输出时可能泄露敏感信息的问题，传统重训练方法计算成本过高，现有FILA方法存在参数识别不准确和需要访问全部模型参数的限制。

Method: 提出VILA框架，明确考虑Fisher信息的基本假设，提高遗忘集参数识别准确性；通过避免访问整个模型参数来显著降低计算成本。

Result: 在TOFU、WMDP和MUSE基准测试中达到最先进性能，相比FILA实现100倍参数效率和40倍训练速度提升。

Conclusion: VILA通过改进参数识别方法和降低计算需求，为LLMs的敏感信息移除提供了高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks but face
challenges related to unintentionally generating outputs containing sensitive
information. A straightforward approach to address this issue is to retrain the
model after excluding the problematic data. However, this approach incurs
prohibitively high computational costs. To overcome this limitation, machine
unlearning has emerged as a promising solution that can effectively remove
sensitive information without the need to retrain the model from scratch.
Recently, FILA has been proposed as a parameter-efficient unlearning method by
integrating LoRA adapters. Specifically, it calculates the Fisher information
to identify parameters associated with the forget set and assigns them to LoRA
adapters for updates. Despite its innovative approach, FILA still requires
access to all model parameters and does not adequately account for fundamental
assumptions underlying Fisher information, leading to inaccuracies in
importance estimation. To address these limitations, we propose VILA, a novel
unlearning framework that explicitly considers the assumptions overlooked in
FILA, thereby enhancing the accuracy of parameter identification for the forget
set. Moreover, VILA significantly reduces computational costs by enabling
parameter identification without accessing the entire model. Our method
achieves up to 100x higher parameter efficiency and 40x faster training speed
compared to FILA, and sets new state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks
including TOFU, WMDP, and MUSE. Our code is available at

### [120] [Convergence of regularized agent-state-based Q-learning in POMDPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21314)
*Amit Sinha,Matthieu Geist,Aditya Mahajan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个分析Q-learning算法收敛性的理论框架，特别针对使用代理状态（非信念状态）和策略正则化的实际算法，证明了在温和条件下收敛到正则化MDP的固定点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际应用中常用的Q-learning算法具有两个显著特征：使用代理状态（如RNN状态）进行递归更新，以及使用策略正则化来促进探索和稳定学习。现有理论分析往往忽略这些实际特征，需要建立更贴近实际算法的收敛理论。

Method: 提出了正则化代理状态Q-learning（RASQL）框架，分析最简单的Q-learning形式。通过定义适当的正则化MDP，证明在温和技术条件下算法收敛到该MDP的固定点。还分析了学习周期性策略的RASQL变体。

Result: 理论分析表明RASQL算法收敛到依赖于行为策略平稳分布的正则化MDP的固定点。数值实验验证了经验收敛行为与理论极限的一致性。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解实际Q-learning算法的收敛性提供了理论框架，证明了在代理状态和策略正则化存在的情况下，算法仍能收敛到明确定义的理论极限，为实际强化学习算法的理论分析奠定了基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework to understand the convergence of
commonly used Q-learning reinforcement learning algorithms in practice. Two
salient features of such algorithms are: (i)~the Q-table is recursively updated
using an agent state (such as the state of a recurrent neural network) which is
not a belief state or an information state and (ii)~policy regularization is
often used to encourage exploration and stabilize the learning algorithm. We
investigate the simplest form of such Q-learning algorithms which we call
regularized agent-state-based Q-learning (RASQL) and show that it converges
under mild technical conditions to the fixed point of an appropriately defined
regularized MDP, which depends on the stationary distribution induced by the
behavioral policy. We also show that a similar analysis continues to work for a
variant of RASQL that learns periodic policies. We present numerical examples
to illustrate that the empirical convergence behavior matches with the proposed
theoretical limit.

*Narmeen Oozeer,Nirmalendu Prakash,Michael Lan,Alice Rigg,Amirali Abdullah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sampled-SAE是一种改进的稀疏自编码器方法，通过评分和采样机制在批次级别和token级别特征选择之间提供可调节的平衡，解决了BatchTopK的激活彩票问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统TopK SAE对每个token使用固定的K个最活跃特征，效率低下且无法处理不同token信息量的差异。BatchTopK虽然改进了平均重建效果，但存在"激活彩票"问题，即罕见的高幅度特征会挤掉更有信息量但幅度较低的特征。

Method: 提出Sampled-SAE方法：对批次激活矩阵的列（特征）进行评分（使用L2范数或熵），形成大小为Kl的候选池，然后应用Top-K从受限的特征池中选择批次中的token。通过调节l参数，可以在批次级别和token特定选择之间连续调节。

Result: 在Pythia-160M模型上的实验表明，没有单一的l值能在所有指标上达到最优，最佳选择取决于共享结构、重建保真度和下游性能之间的权衡。

Conclusion: Sampled-SAE将BatchTopK重新构建为一个可调节的、分布感知的方法家族，提供了在全局一致性和细粒度重建之间的灵活权衡。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose neural activations into interpretable
features. A widely adopted variant, the TopK SAE, reconstructs each token from
its K most active latents. However, this approach is inefficient, as some
tokens carry more information than others. BatchTopK addresses this limitation
by selecting top activations across a batch of tokens. This improves average
reconstruction but risks an "activation lottery," where rare high-magnitude
features crowd out more informative but lower-magnitude ones. To address this
issue, we introduce Sampled-SAE: we score the columns (representing features)
of the batch activation matrix (via $L_2$ norm or entropy), forming a candidate
pool of size $Kl$, and then apply Top-$K$ to select tokens across the batch
from the restricted pool of features. Varying $l$ traces a spectrum between
batch-level and token-specific selection. At $l=1$, tokens draw only from $K$
globally influential features, while larger $l$ expands the pool toward
standard BatchTopK and more token-specific features across the batch. Small $l$
thus enforces global consistency; large $l$ favors fine-grained reconstruction.
On Pythia-160M, no single value optimizes $l$ across all metrics: the best
choice depends on the trade-off between shared structure, reconstruction
fidelity, and downstream performance. Sampled-SAE thus reframes BatchTopK as a
tunable, distribution-aware family.

TL;DR: Stage-Diff是一个基于扩散模型的分阶段生成模型，专门针对长期时间序列生成任务，通过分阶段序列生成和阶段间信息传递来平衡长期依赖和数据分布漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期时间序列具有复杂的长程时间依赖性和数据分布随时间逐渐变化的特点，同时包含更复杂的特征序列间相互关系。现有生成模型在处理这些挑战时存在困难，需要新的方法来平衡长期依赖和数据分布漂移，并有效捕捉序列内和序列间依赖关系。

Method: 提出Stage-Diff模型：1）通过分阶段序列生成和阶段间信息传递，在保持长期序列依赖的同时建模数据分布漂移；2）在每个阶段内应用渐进序列分解，在不同时间尺度上进行通道独立建模；3）阶段间信息传递采用多通道融合建模，结合通道独立建模的鲁棒性和多通道建模的信息融合优势。

Result: 在多个真实世界数据集上的广泛实验验证了Stage-Diff在长期时间序列生成任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: Stage-Diff模型成功解决了长期时间序列生成中的关键挑战，通过分阶段生成和混合建模策略有效平衡了长期时间依赖、数据分布漂移以及序列内和序列间依赖关系的捕捉。

Abstract: Generative models have been successfully used in the field of time series
generation. However, when dealing with long-term time series, which span over
extended periods and exhibit more complex long-term temporal patterns, the task
of generation becomes significantly more challenging. Long-term time series
exhibit long-range temporal dependencies, but their data distribution also
undergoes gradual changes over time. Finding a balance between these long-term
dependencies and the drift in data distribution is a key challenge. On the
other hand, long-term time series contain more complex interrelationships
between different feature sequences, making the task of effectively capturing
both intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies another important
challenge. To address these issues, we propose Stage-Diff, a staged generative
model for long-term time series based on diffusion models. First, through
stage-wise sequence generation and inter-stage information transfer, the model
preserves long-term sequence dependencies while enabling the modeling of data
distribution shifts. Second, within each stage, progressive sequence
decomposition is applied to perform channel-independent modeling at different
time scales, while inter-stage information transfer utilizes multi-channel
fusion modeling. This approach combines the robustness of channel-independent
modeling with the information fusion advantages of multi-channel modeling,
effectively balancing the intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies of
long-term time series. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets
validate the effectiveness of Stage-Diff in long-term time series generation
tasks.

TL;DR: 提出DLGAN模型，通过双层结构（特征提取和序列重建）解决时间序列合成中时间依赖性和特征捕捉问题，在多个数据集上表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列合成方法基于随机序列进行时序建模，难以保证生成时间序列的时间依赖性，且难以准确捕捉原始时间序列的特征信息

Method: 双层生成对抗网络(DLGAN)：1)序列特征提取和序列重建两阶段形成完整自编码器，确保重建过程能恢复序列时间依赖性；2)使用GAN生成与真实序列特征向量对齐的合成特征向量

Result: 在四个公共数据集上的大量实验表明，该模型在各种评估指标上均表现出优越性

Conclusion: DLGAN是一个简单但有效的生成模型，能够有效解决时间序列合成中的时间依赖性和特征捕捉问题

Abstract: Time series synthesis is an effective approach to ensuring the secure
circulation of time series data. Existing time series synthesis methods
typically perform temporal modeling based on random sequences to generate
target sequences, which often struggle to ensure the temporal dependencies in
the generated time series. Additionally, directly modeling temporal features on
random sequences makes it challenging to accurately capture the feature
information of the original time series. To address the above issues, we
propose a simple but effective generative model \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{L}ayer
\textbf{G}enerative \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{N}etworks, named
\textbf{DLGAN}. The model decomposes the time series generation process into
two stages: sequence feature extraction and sequence reconstruction. First,
these two stages form a complete time series autoencoder, enabling supervised
learning on the original time series to ensure that the reconstruction process
can restore the temporal dependencies of the sequence. Second, a Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) is used to generate synthetic feature vectors that
align with the real-time sequence feature vectors, ensuring that the generator
can capture the temporal features from real time series. Extensive experiments
on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of this model across
various evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: 提出AHTSGD算法，通过根据损失景观锐度动态调整注入噪声的尾部特性，促进收敛到宽盆地，提高泛化性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于梯度噪声的重尾分布特性和Edge of Stability现象，旨在解决大规模神经网络优化中过度依赖训练损失导致的泛化问题

Method: AHTSGD算法在训练早期注入重尾噪声增强探索，随着锐度稳定逐渐过渡到轻尾噪声，动态适应损失景观锐度变化

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10等基准测试中 consistently优于SGD和其他基于噪声的方法，在SVHN等噪声数据集上表现尤为突出

Conclusion: AHTSGD能加速从不良初始化的早期训练，在干净和噪声设置下都改善泛化性能，且对学习率选择保持鲁棒性

Abstract: In the era of large-scale neural network models, optimization algorithms
often struggle with generalization due to an overreliance on training loss. One
key insight widely accepted in the machine learning community is the idea that
wide basins (regions around a local minimum where the loss increases gradually)
promote better generalization by offering greater stability to small changes in
input data or model parameters. In contrast, sharp minima are typically more
sensitive and less stable. Motivated by two key empirical observations - the
inherent heavy-tailed distribution of gradient noise in stochastic gradient
descent and the Edge of Stability phenomenon during neural network training, in
which curvature grows before settling at a plateau, we introduce Adaptive Heavy
Tailed Stochastic Gradient Descent (AHTSGD). The algorithm injects
heavier-tailed noise into the optimizer during the early stages of training to
enhance exploration and gradually transitions to lighter-tailed noise as
sharpness stabilizes. By dynamically adapting to the sharpness of the loss
landscape throughout training, AHTSGD promotes accelerated convergence to wide
basins. AHTSGD is the first algorithm to adjust the nature of injected noise
into an optimizer based on the Edge of Stability phenomenon. AHTSGD
consistently outperforms SGD and other noise-based methods on benchmarks like
MNIST and CIFAR-10, with marked gains on noisy datasets such as SVHN. It
ultimately accelerates early training from poor initializations and improves
generalization across clean and noisy settings, remaining robust to learning
rate choices.

Motivation: 探究神经网络是通过平滑渐进还是复杂计算过程来构建表示，通过分析超人类国际象棋引擎Leela Chess Zero的策略网络来验证

Method: 扩展logit lens技术来分析Leela Chess Zero策略网络，通过层间分析观察策略分布、走法排名和政策分歧的变化轨迹

Result: 发现虽然玩棋强度和解题能力呈现强单调趋势，但策略分布经常遵循非平滑轨迹，包括早期发现但随后丢弃的正确解、与最终输出相关性差的走法排名，以及直到网络后期仍存在的高政策分歧

Conclusion: 与国际象棋AI相比，语言模型通常观察到的平滑分布收敛形成鲜明对比，表明神经网络表示构建过程可能因任务类型而异，存在复杂的非平滑计算机制

Abstract: Do neural networks build their representations through smooth, gradual
refinement, or via more complex computational processes? We investigate this by
extending the logit lens to analyze the policy network of Leela Chess Zero, a
superhuman chess engine. We find strong monotonic trends in playing strength
and puzzle-solving ability across layers, yet policy distributions frequently
follow non-smooth trajectories. Evidence for this includes correct puzzle
solutions that are discovered early but subsequently discarded, move rankings
that remain poorly correlated with final outputs, and high policy divergence
until late in the network. These findings contrast with the smooth
distributional convergence typically observed in language models.

Abstract: We introduce PMODE (Partitioned Mixture Of Density Estimators), a general and
modular framework for mixture modeling with both parametric and nonparametric
components. PMODE builds mixtures by partitioning the data and fitting separate
estimators to each subset. It attains near-optimal rates for this estimator
class and remains valid even when the mixture components come from different
distribution families. As an application, we develop MV-PMODE, which scales a
previously theoretical approach to high-dimensional density estimation to
settings with thousands of dimensions. Despite its simplicity, it performs
competitively against deep baselines on CIFAR-10 anomaly detection.

Abstract: Using data from mobile network utilization in Norway, we showcase the
possibility of monitoring the state of communication and mobility networks with
a non-invasive, low-cost method. This method transforms the network data into a
model within the framework of reservoir computing and then measures the model's
performance on proxy tasks. Experimentally, we show how the performance on
these proxies relates to the state of the network. A key advantage of this
approach is that it uses readily available data sets and leverages the
reservoir computing framework for an inexpensive and largely agnostic method.
Data from mobile network utilization is available in an anonymous, aggregated
form with multiple snapshots per day. This data can be treated like a weighted
network. Reservoir computing allows the use of weighted, but untrained networks
as a machine learning tool. The network, initialized as a so-called echo state
network (ESN), projects incoming signals into a higher dimensional space, on
which a single trained layer operates. This consumes less energy than deep
neural networks in which every weight of the network is trained. We use
neuroscience inspired tasks and trained our ESN model to solve them. We then
show how the performance depends on certain network configurations and also how
it visibly decreases when perturbing the network. While this work serves as
proof of concept, we believe it can be elevated to be used for near-real-time
monitoring as well as the identification of possible weak spots of both mobile
communication networks as well as transportation networks.

Result: 在标准基准测试中，CoM实现了最先进的性能表现，有效缓解了由协变量偏移引起的性能退化。

Conclusion: CoM通过考虑层间依赖关系，解决了深度网络合并中的内部协变量偏移问题，为模型合并提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained models has become a standard pathway to achieve
state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of domains, leading to a
proliferation of task-specific model variants. As the number of such
specialized modules in-creases, merging them into a unified model without
retraining has become a critical challenge. Existing merging techniques often
rely on interference heuristics,importance weighting, or activation matching
while treating each layer independently, thereby failing to account for the
inter-layer dependencies inherent in deep networks. This simplification leads
to distributional mismatches, especially inactivation-based methods, when
changes in early layers are not properly reflected in downstream ones. We
identify these mismatches as a form of internal covariate shift, comparable to
the phenomenon encountered in the initial phases of neural networks training.
To address it, we propose Chain of Merges (CoM), a layer-wise merging procedure
that updates activation statistics in an auto-regressive fashion, explicitly
accounting for cross-layer interactions. CoM produces a coherent merged model
through a series of conditionally optimal updates, effectively mitigating
degradation caused by covariate shift. Experiments on standard bench-marks
demonstrate that CoM achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: The development of continuous biomanufacturing processes requires robust and
early anomaly detection, since even minor deviations can compromise yield and
stability, leading to disruptions in scheduling, reduced weekly production, and
diminished economic performance. These processes are inherently complex and
exhibit non-linear dynamics with intricate relationships between process
variables, thus making advanced methods for anomaly detection essential for
efficient operation. In this work, we present a novel framework for
unsupervised anomaly detection in continuous biomanufacturing based on an
ensemble of generative adversarial networks (GANs). We first establish a
benchmark dataset simulating both normal and anomalous operation regimes in a
continuous process for the production of a small molecule. We then demonstrate
the effectiveness of our GAN-based framework in detecting anomalies caused by
sudden feedstock variability. Finally, we evaluate the impact of using a hybrid
quantum/classical GAN approach with both a simulated quantum circuit and a real
photonic quantum processor on anomaly detection performance. We find that the
hybrid approach yields improved anomaly detection rates. Our work shows the
potential of hybrid quantum/classical approaches for solving real-world
problems in complex continuous biomanufacturing processes.

Result: 在挑战性模拟环境中，该算法优于传统RL方法

Conclusion: 成功开发了同时优化整体平均和个体轨迹长期性能的实用RL算法，通过时间平均增长率正则化实现了更好的性能

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms typically optimize the expected
cumulative reward, i.e., the expected value of the sum of scalar rewards an
agent receives over the course of a trajectory. The expected value averages the
performance over an infinite number of trajectories. However, when deploying
the agent in the real world, this ensemble average may be uninformative for the
performance of individual trajectories. Thus, in many applications, optimizing
the long-term performance of individual trajectories might be more desirable.
In this work, we propose a novel RL algorithm that combines the standard
ensemble average with the time-average growth rate, a measure for the long-term
performance of individual trajectories. We first define the Bellman operator
for the time-average growth rate. We then show that, under multiplicative
reward dynamics, the geometric mean aligns with the time-average growth rate.
To address more general and unknown reward dynamics, we propose a modified
geometric mean with $N$-sliding window that captures the path-dependency as an
estimator for the time-average growth rate. This estimator is embedded as a
regularizer into the objective, forming a practical algorithm and enabling the
policy to benefit from ensemble average and time-average simultaneously. We
evaluate our algorithm in challenging simulations, where it outperforms
conventional RL methods.

Abstract: In recent years, with the large-scale expansion of graph data, there has been
an increased focus on Riemannian manifold data spaces other than Euclidean
space. In particular, the development of hyperbolic spaces has been remarkable,
and they have high expressive power for graph data with hierarchical
structures. Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML) is employed in regret
minimization and model selection. However, existing formulations of NML have
been developed primarily in Euclidean spaces and are inherently dependent on
the choice of coordinate systems, making it non-trivial to extend NML to
Riemannian manifolds. In this study, we define a new NML that reflects the
geometric structure of Riemannian manifolds, called the Riemannian manifold NML
(Rm-NML). This Rm-NML is invariant under coordinate transformations and
coincides with the conventional NML under the natural parameterization in
Euclidean space. We extend existing computational techniques for NML to the
setting of Riemannian manifolds. Furthermore, we derive a method to simplify
the computation of Rm-NML on Riemannian symmetric spaces, which encompass data
spaces of growing interest such as hyperbolic spaces. To illustrate the
practical application of our proposed method, we explicitly computed the Rm-NML
for normal distributions on hyperbolic spaces.

Abstract: Recent advances in Structure-based Drug Design (SBDD) have leveraged
generative models for 3D molecular generation, predominantly evaluating model
performance by binding affinity to target proteins. However, practical drug
discovery necessitates high binding affinity along with synthetic feasibility
and selectivity, critical properties that were largely neglected in previous
evaluations. To address this gap, we identify fundamental limitations of
conventional diffusion-based generative models in effectively guiding molecule
generation toward these diverse pharmacological properties. We propose CByG, a
novel framework extending Bayesian Flow Network into a gradient-based
conditional generative model that robustly integrates property-specific
guidance. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation scheme
incorporating practical benchmarks for binding affinity, synthetic feasibility,
and selectivity, overcoming the limitations of conventional evaluation methods.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed CByG framework
significantly outperforms baseline models across multiple essential evaluation
criteria, highlighting its effectiveness and practicality for real-world drug
discovery applications.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification in reinforcement learning can greatly improve
exploration and robustness. Approximate Bayesian approaches have recently been
popularized to quantify uncertainty in model-free algorithms. However, so far
the focus has been on improving the accuracy of the posterior approximation,
instead of studying the accuracy of the prior and likelihood assumptions
underlying the posterior. In this work, we demonstrate that there is a cold
posterior effect in Bayesian deep Q-learning, where contrary to theory,
performance increases when reducing the temperature of the posterior. To
identify and overcome likely causes, we challenge common assumptions made on
the likelihood and priors in Bayesian model-free algorithms. We empirically
study prior distributions and show through statistical tests that the common
Gaussian likelihood assumption is frequently violated. We argue that developing
more suitable likelihoods and priors should be a key focus in future Bayesian
reinforcement learning research and we offer simple, implementable solutions
for better priors in deep Q-learning that lead to more performant Bayesian
algorithms.

Conclusion: 失败预测是比传统校准方法更可靠的早退模型评估基准，为早退模型的设计和优化提供了更有效的指导方向

Abstract: Early-exit models speed up inference by attaching internal classifiers to
intermediate layers of the model and allowing computation to stop once a
prediction satisfies an exit criterion. Most early-exit methods rely on
confidence-based exit strategies, which motivated some works to calibrate
intermediate classifiers to improve the performance of the entire model. In
this paper, we show that calibration measures can be misleading indicators of
the performance of multi-exit models: a well-calibrated classifier may still
waste computation, and common calibration methods do not preserve the sample
ranking within a classifier. We demonstrate empirical cases where miscalibrated
networks outperform calibrated ones. As an alternative, we propose to use
failure prediction as a more useful proxy for early-exit model performance.
Unlike calibration, failure prediction accounts for changes in the ranking of
samples and shows a strong correlation with efficiency improvements, making it
a more dependable basis for designing and evaluating early-exit models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SNN-DT将脉冲神经网络与决策变换器结合，在保持性能的同时实现超低功耗，每决策仅发射不到10个脉冲，能耗降低4个数量级


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于Transformer的强化学习代理依赖密集矩阵运算，不适合能源受限的边缘平台，而脉冲神经网络虽然功耗极低但尚未与序列建模无缝融合

Method: 在每个自注意力块中嵌入Leaky Integrate-and-Fire神经元，通过替代梯度进行端到端训练，包含生物启发的三因子可塑性、相移脉冲位置编码和轻量级树突路由模块

Result: 在经典控制基准测试中匹配或超越标准决策变换器性能，同时每决策发射少于10个脉冲，推理能耗降低超过4个数量级

Conclusion: SNN-DT通过将序列建模与神经形态效率相结合，为嵌入式可穿戴设备上的实时低功耗控制开辟了新途径

Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents based on Transformer architectures have
achieved impressive performance on sequential decision-making tasks, but their
reliance on dense matrix operations makes them ill-suited for
energy-constrained, edge-oriented platforms. Spiking neural networks promise
ultra-low-power, event-driven inference, yet no prior work has seamlessly
merged spiking dynamics with return-conditioned sequence modeling. We present
the Spiking Decision Transformer (SNN-DT), which embeds Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire neurons into each self-attention block, trains end-to-end
via surrogate gradients, and incorporates biologically inspired three-factor
plasticity, phase-shifted spike-based positional encodings, and a lightweight
dendritic routing module. Our implementation matches or exceeds standard
Decision Transformer performance on classic control benchmarks (CartPole-v1,
MountainCar-v0, Acrobot-v1, Pendulum-v1) while emitting fewer than ten spikes
per decision, an energy proxy suggesting over four orders-of-magnitude
reduction in per inference energy. By marrying sequence modeling with
neuromorphic efficiency, SNN-DT opens a pathway toward real-time, low-power
control on embedded and wearable devices.

TL;DR: LLM在贷款审批等高风险决策任务中应用广泛，但处理表格数据时存在性能和公平性问题。研究发现序列化格式选择显著影响LLM的表现和公平性，ICL能提升性能但对公平性的影响因数据集而异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在贷款审批等高风险决策任务中的应用增加，需要评估其在处理表格数据时的性能和公平性表现，特别是在不同地理区域数据集上的表现差异。

Method: 评估LLM在加纳、德国和美国三个地理区域贷款审批数据集上的零样本学习和上下文学习能力，重点分析不同序列化格式对模型性能和公平性的影响。

Result: 序列化格式选择显著影响LLM的性能和公平性，某些格式如GReat和LIFT能提高F1分数但加剧公平性差距。ICL相比零样本基线提升性能4.9-59.6%，但对公平性的影响因数据集而异。

Conclusion: 需要开发有效的表格数据表示方法和公平性感知模型，以提高LLM在金融决策中的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in high-stakes
decision-making tasks, such as loan approvals. While their applications expand
across domains, LLMs struggle to process tabular data, ensuring fairness and
delivering reliable predictions. In this work, we assess the performance and
fairness of LLMs on serialized loan approval datasets from three geographically
distinct regions: Ghana, Germany, and the United States. Our evaluation focuses
on the model's zero-shot and in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. Our
results reveal that the choice of serialization (Serialization refers to the
process of converting tabular data into text formats suitable for processing by
LLMs.) format significantly affects both performance and fairness in LLMs, with
certain formats such as GReat and LIFT yielding higher F1 scores but
exacerbating fairness disparities. Notably, while ICL improved model
performance by 4.9-59.6% relative to zero-shot baselines, its effect on
fairness varied considerably across datasets. Our work underscores the
importance of effective tabular data representation methods and fairness-aware
models to improve the reliability of LLMs in financial decision-making.

Motivation: GNN在求解布尔可满足性问题时，面对困难实例性能急剧下降，需要探究这是否反映了根本性的架构限制。

Method: 使用图里奇曲率理论分析SAT公式的图表示，证明随机k-SAT公式二分图的负曲率特性，并通过实验验证曲率与问题难度及GNN性能的关系。

Result: 发现SAT实例难度与图曲率负相关，曲率是问题复杂度的强指标，并能预测GNN求解器的性能表现。

Conclusion: 图曲率分析揭示了GNN在SAT求解中的局限性，为现有求解器设计原则提供了理论解释，并指出了未来改进的方向。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently shown promise as solvers for
Boolean Satisfiability Problems (SATs) by operating on graph representations of
logical formulas. However, their performance degrades sharply on harder
instances, raising the question of whether this reflects fundamental
architectural limitations. In this work, we provide a geometric explanation
through the lens of graph Ricci Curvature (RC), which quantifies local
connectivity bottlenecks. We prove that bipartite graphs derived from random
k-SAT formulas are inherently negatively curved, and that this curvature
decreases with instance difficulty. Building on this, we show that GNN-based
SAT solvers are affected by oversquashing, a phenomenon where long-range
dependencies become impossible to compress into fixed-length representations.
We validate our claims empirically across different SAT benchmarks and confirm
that curvature is both a strong indicator of problem complexity and can be used
to predict performance. Finally, we connect our findings to design principles
of existing solvers and outline promising directions for future work.

Abstract: Recent studies show the promise of large language models (LLMs) for few-shot
tabular classification but highlight challenges due to the variability in
structured data. To address this, we propose distilling data into actionable
insights to enable robust and effective classification by LLMs. Drawing
inspiration from human learning processes, we introduce InsightTab, an insight
distillation framework guided by principles of divide-and-conquer, easy-first,
and reflective learning. Our approach integrates rule summarization, strategic
exemplification, and insight reflection through deep collaboration between LLMs
and data modeling techniques. The obtained insights enable LLMs to better align
their general knowledge and capabilities with the particular requirements of
specific tabular tasks. We extensively evaluate InsightTab on nine datasets.
The results demonstrate consistent improvement over state-of-the-art methods.
Ablation studies further validate the principle-guided distillation process,
while analyses emphasize InsightTab's effectiveness in leveraging labeled data
and managing bias.

Abstract: We introduce a novel wearable textile-garment featuring an innovative
electrode placement aimed at minimizing noise and motion artifacts, thereby
enhancing signal fidelity in Electrocardiography (ECG) recordings. We present a
comprehensive, sex-balanced evaluation involving 15 healthy males and 15
healthy female participants to ensure the device's suitability across
anatomical and physiological variations. The assessment framework encompasses
distinct evaluation approaches: quantitative signal quality indices to
objectively benchmark device performance; rhythm-based analyzes of
physiological parameters such as heart rate and heart rate variability; machine
learning classification tasks to assess application-relevant predictive
utility; morphological analysis of ECG features including amplitude and
interval parameters; and investigations of the effects of electrode projection
angle given by the textile / body shape, with all analyzes stratified by sex to
elucidate sex-specific influences. Evaluations were conducted across various
activity phases representing real-world conditions. The results demonstrate
that the textile system achieves signal quality highly concordant with
reference devices in both rhythm and morphological analyses, exhibits robust
classification performance, and enables identification of key sex-specific
determinants affecting signal acquisition. These findings underscore the
practical viability of textile-based ECG garments for physiological monitoring
as well as psychophysiological state detection. Moreover, we identify the
importance of incorporating sex-specific design considerations to ensure
equitable and reliable cardiac diagnostics in wearable health technologies.

TL;DR: PINNs在智能电网建模中通过物理约束损失函数实现卓越泛化性能，相比传统数据驱动方法在误差减少和物理一致性方面表现更优


<details>

Motivation: 解决传统数据驱动方法在智能电网建模中的数据稀缺和物理一致性挑战，将物理定律直接集成到学习框架中

Method: 使用基于物理的损失函数训练PINNs（强制执行功率平衡、操作约束和电网稳定性），并与XGBoost、随机森林和线性回归在插值、交叉验证和轨迹预测三个实验中进行比较

Result: PINNs展现出优越的泛化能力，在动态电网操作中保持较低的MAE，可靠地捕捉状态转换，而传统模型表现不稳定。尽管在极端操作状态下略有退化，但PINNs始终强制执行物理可行性

Conclusion: PINNs作为智能电网替代模型的范式转变工具，将数据驱动的灵活性与第一性原理的严谨性相结合，对实时电网控制和可扩展数字孪生具有重要意义

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) present a transformative approach
for smart grid modeling by integrating physical laws directly into learning
frameworks, addressing critical challenges of data scarcity and physical
consistency in conventional data-driven methods. This paper evaluates PINNs'
capabilities as surrogate models for smart grid dynamics, comparing their
performance against XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression across three
key experiments: interpolation, cross-validation, and episodic trajectory
prediction. By training PINNs exclusively through physics-based loss functions
(enforcing power balance, operational constraints, and grid stability) we
demonstrate their superior generalization, outperforming data-driven models in
error reduction. Notably, PINNs maintain comparatively lower MAE in dynamic
grid operations, reliably capturing state transitions in both random and
expert-driven control scenarios, while traditional models exhibit erratic
performance. Despite slight degradation in extreme operational regimes, PINNs
consistently enforce physical feasibility, proving vital for safety-critical
applications. Our results contribute to establishing PINNs as a
paradigm-shifting tool for smart grid surrogation, bridging data-driven
flexibility with first-principles rigor. This work advances real-time grid
control and scalable digital twins, emphasizing the necessity of physics-aware
architectures in mission-critical energy systems.

Abstract: Ocean salinity plays a vital role in circulation, climate, and marine
ecosystems, yet its measurement is often sparse, irregular, and noisy,
especially in drifter-based datasets. Traditional approaches, such as remote
sensing and optimal interpolation, rely on linearity and stationarity, and are
limited by cloud cover, sensor drift, and low satellite revisit rates. While
machine learning models offer flexibility, they often fail under severe
sparsity and lack principled ways to incorporate physical covariates without
specialized sensors. In this paper, we introduce the OceAn Salinity Imputation
System (OASIS), a novel diffusion adversarial framework designed to address
these challenges.

Conclusion: 该分析为随机算法训练的神经网络提供了理论保证，并深入揭示了优化过程的动态特性，扩展了PINNs训练的理论基础

Abstract: Physics informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a very popular class of
neural solvers for partial differential equations. In practice, one often
employs stochastic gradient descent type algorithms to train the neural
network. Therefore, the convergence guarantee of stochastic gradient descent is
of fundamental importance. In this work, we establish the linear convergence of
stochastic gradient descent / flow in training over-parameterized two layer
PINNs for a general class of activation functions in the sense of high
probability. These results extend the existing result [18] in which gradient
descent was analyzed. The challenge of the analysis lies in handling the
dynamic randomness introduced by stochastic optimization methods. The key of
the analysis lies in ensuring the positive definiteness of suitable Gram
matrices during the training. The analysis sheds insight into the dynamics of
the optimization process, and provides guarantees on the neural networks
trained by stochastic algorithms.

Abstract: Decision theories offer principled methods for making choices under various
types of uncertainty. Algorithms that implement these theories have been
successfully applied to a wide range of real-world problems, including
materials and drug discovery. Indeed, they are desirable since they can
adaptively gather information to make better decisions in the future, resulting
in data-efficient workflows. In scientific discovery, where experiments are
costly, these algorithms can thus significantly reduce the cost of
experimentation. Theoretical analyses of these algorithms are crucial for
understanding their behavior and providing valuable insights for developing
next-generation algorithms. However, theoretical analyses in the literature are
often inaccessible to non-experts. This monograph aims to provide an
accessible, self-contained introduction to the theoretical analysis of commonly
used probabilistic decision-making algorithms, including bandit algorithms,
Bayesian optimization, and tree search algorithms. Only basic knowledge of
probability theory and statistics, along with some elementary knowledge about
Gaussian processes, is assumed.

Result: 模型在点赞预测上表现优异（R²=0.98），但在评论预测上效果局限（R²=0.41），显示评论受其他未包含因素影响

Conclusion: 情感和曝光度特征能有效预测点赞行为，但评论行为需要更多未知因素来提升预测准确性

Abstract: We present a machine learning approach for predicting social media engagement
(comments and likes) from emotional and temporal features. The dataset contains
600 songs with annotations for valence, arousal, and related sentiment metrics.
A multi target regression model based on HistGradientBoostingRegressor is
trained on log transformed engagement ratios to address skewed targets.
Performance is evaluated with both a custom order of magnitude accuracy and
standard regression metrics, including the coefficient of determination (R^2).
Results show that emotional and temporal metadata, together with existing view
counts, predict future engagement effectively. The model attains R^2 = 0.98 for
likes but only R^2 = 0.41 for comments. This gap indicates that likes are
largely driven by readily captured affective and exposure signals, whereas
comments depend on additional factors not represented in the current feature
set.

Motivation: 确保深度学习模型在真实应用中的可靠性，需要有效区分训练分布内(ID)和分布外(OOD)样本，特别是在不同分布偏移程度下的检测挑战

Method: 使用奇异值分解分类头权重矩阵，将模型激活分解为对分类输出贡献最大的决定性分量和贡献最小的无关分量。远OOD时利用无关分量，近OOD时利用决定性分量

Result: 在多个标准OOD基准测试中取得了最先进的结果

Conclusion: 通过分析分类头权重矩阵的奇异值分解，可以更有效地处理不同分布偏移程度的OOD检测问题，ActSub方法在远OOD和近OOD场景下都表现出色

Abstract: To ensure the reliability of deep models in real-world applications,
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods aim to distinguish samples close to
the training distribution (in-distribution, ID) from those farther away (OOD).
In this work, we propose a novel OOD detection method that utilizes singular
value decomposition of the weight matrix of the classification head to
decompose the model's activations into decisive and insignificant components,
which contribute maximally, respectively minimally, to the final classifier
output. We find that the subspace of insignificant components more effectively
distinguishes ID from OOD data than raw activations in regimes of large
distribution shifts (Far-OOD). This occurs because the classification objective
leaves the insignificant subspace largely unaffected, yielding features that
are ''untainted'' by the target classification task. Conversely, in regimes of
smaller distribution shifts (Near-OOD), we find that activation shaping methods
profit from only considering the decisive subspace, as the insignificant
component can cause interference in the activation space. By combining two
findings into a single approach, termed ActSub, we achieve state-of-the-art
results in various standard OOD benchmarks.

Motivation: 估计社区特定心理健康事件的影响对公共卫生政策至关重要，传统预测方法提供的信息有限，需要更可能具有因果效应的准实验设计。

Method: 将LRDD扩展到统计学习框架，利用位置历史评分、动态协变量和外生变量来预测未来的断点（时间特定变化）和斜率变化（线性轨迹）。

Conclusion: 断点预测为估计未来或假设事件对特定社区的异质性影响提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Estimating community-specific mental health effects of local events is vital
for public health policy. While forecasting mental health scores alone offers
limited insights into the impact of events on community well-being,
quasi-experimental designs like the Longitudinal Regression Discontinuity
Design (LRDD) from econometrics help researchers derive more effects that are
more likely to be causal from observational data. LRDDs aim to extrapolate the
size of changes in an outcome (e.g. a discontinuity in running scores for
anxiety) due to a time-specific event. Here, we propose adapting LRDDs beyond
traditional forecasting into a statistical learning framework whereby future
discontinuities (i.e. time-specific shifts) and changes in slope (i.e. linear
trajectories) are estimated given a location's history of the score, dynamic
covariates (other running assessments), and exogenous variables (static
representations). Applying our framework to predict discontinuities in the
anxiety of US counties from COVID-19 events, we found the task was difficult
but more achievable as the sophistication of models was increased, with the
best results coming from integrating exogenous and dynamic covariates. Our
approach shows strong improvement ($r=+.46$ for discontinuity and $r = +.65$
for slope) over traditional static community representations. Discontinuity
forecasting raises new possibilities for estimating the idiosyncratic effects
of potential future or hypothetical events on specific communities.

TL;DR: SLAC开发了SNL框架和Auto-SNL工具，用于在FPGA上实现实时机器学习推理，解决了高能物理实验中TB/s级数据流的实时处理挑战，相比现有工具在延迟和资源使用上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LCLS-II自由电子激光器产生高达1MHz的X射线脉冲，探测器数据吞吐量超过1TB/s，传统数据传输和存储成本过高，需要实时机器学习进行数据压缩，但现有方案延迟过高。

Method: 开发SLAC神经网络库(SNL)框架，支持在FPGA上部署实时ML推理模型，并能动态更新模型权重无需重新合成。同时开发Auto-SNL Python扩展，自动将Python神经网络模型转换为SNL兼容的高级综合代码。

Result: 与当前最先进的hls4ml工具进行基准测试，在多种神经网络架构、定点精度和合成配置下，SNL在大多数架构中实现了竞争性或更优的延迟性能，在某些情况下还节省了FPGA资源。

Conclusion: SNL展示了其多功能性，为高能物理、医学成像、机器人等领域的研究人员和学者开辟了新的机会，解决了高速实验环境中的实时数据处理挑战。

Abstract: The LCLS-II Free Electron Laser (FEL) will generate X-ray pulses for beamline
experiments at rates of up to 1~MHz, with detectors producing data throughputs
exceeding 1 TB/s. Managing such massive data streams presents significant
challenges, as transmission and storage infrastructures become prohibitively
expensive. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising solution for real-time data
reduction, but conventional implementations introduce excessive latency, making
them unsuitable for high-speed experimental environments. To address these
challenges, SLAC developed the SLAC Neural Network Library (SNL), a specialized
framework designed to deploy real-time ML inference models on
Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). SNL's key feature is the ability to
dynamically update model weights without requiring FPGA resynthesis, enhancing
flexibility for adaptive learning applications. To further enhance usability
and accessibility, we introduce Auto-SNL, a Python extension that streamlines
the process of converting Python-based neural network models into
SNL-compatible high-level synthesis code. This paper presents a benchmark
comparison against hls4ml, the current state-of-the-art tool, across multiple
neural network architectures, fixed-point precisions, and synthesis
configurations targeting a Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA. The results showed that SNL
achieves competitive or superior latency in most tested architectures, while in
some cases also offering FPGA resource savings. This adaptation demonstrates
SNL's versatility, opening new opportunities for researchers and academics in
fields such as high-energy physics, medical imaging, robotics, and many more.

TL;DR: 提出了UniMLR新范式，利用正标签排序信息而非传统二分类方法，统一多标签排序和分类任务，并通过合成数据集验证了方法的有效性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多标签排序方法仅利用正负标签二分信息，忽略了正标签之间的排序关系，无法充分利用标签重要性差异信息

Method: 提出UniMLR框架，将类别相关性建模为概率分布，利用正标签排序信息来学习标签重要性表示，并创建了8个合成数据集（Ranked MNISTs）解决数据稀缺和标注偏差问题

Result: 统计验证表明该方法能准确学习与真实排序一致的表示，且与底层重要性值成比例。在真实和合成数据集上的实验证明了框架的价值

Conclusion: UniMLR通过利用正标签排序信息统一了多标签排序和分类任务，为多标签学习提供了新的有效范式

Abstract: Existing multi-label ranking (MLR) frameworks only exploit information
deduced from the bipartition of labels into positive and negative sets.
Therefore, they do not benefit from ranking among positive labels, which is the
novel MLR approach we introduce in this paper. We propose UniMLR, a new MLR
paradigm that models implicit class relevance/significance values as
probability distributions using the ranking among positive labels, rather than
treating them as equally important. This approach unifies ranking and
classification tasks associated with MLR. Additionally, we address the
challenges of scarcity and annotation bias in MLR datasets by introducing eight
synthetic datasets (Ranked MNISTs) generated with varying
significance-determining factors, providing an enriched and controllable
experimental environment. We statistically demonstrate that our method
accurately learns a representation of the positive rank order, which is
consistent with the ground truth and proportional to the underlying
significance values. Finally, we conduct comprehensive empirical experiments on
both real-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrating the value of our proposed
framework.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一个处理心率预测中数据异质性问题的框架，通过随机特征丢弃处理设备源异质性，使用时序注意力模块和对比学习处理用户异质性，在两个数据集上性能提升15-17%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心率预测在现实部署中面临数据异质性挑战，包括设备源异质性（不同设备特征集不同）和用户异质性（不同用户生理模式差异）。现有方法要么丢弃设备特定信息，要么无法建模用户特定差异。

Method: 提出一个学习对两种异质性都不敏感的潜在表示框架：1）随机特征丢弃策略处理源异质性；2）时序注意力模块捕获长期生理特征；3）对比学习目标构建判别性表示空间。创建并发布了新基准数据集ParroTao。

Result: 在ParroTao和FitRec数据集上分别比现有基线方法性能提升17%和15%。学习到的表示具有很强的判别能力，下游应用任务验证了模型的实用价值。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效处理心率预测中的数据异质性问题，学习到的表示对设备源和用户差异都具有鲁棒性，在现实世界部署中表现出色。

Abstract: Heart rate prediction is vital for personalized health monitoring and
fitness, while it frequently faces a critical challenge when deploying in
real-world: data heterogeneity. We classify it in two key dimensions: source
heterogeneity from fragmented device markets with varying feature sets, and
user heterogeneity reflecting distinct physiological patterns across
individuals and activities. Existing methods either discard device-specific
information, or fail to model user-specific differences, limiting their
real-world performance. To address this, we propose a framework that learns
latent representations agnostic to both heterogeneity, enabling downstream
predictors to work consistently under heterogeneous data patterns.
Specifically, we introduce a random feature dropout strategy to handle source
heterogeneity, making the model robust to various feature sets. To manage user
heterogeneity, we employ a time-aware attention module to capture long-term
physiological traits and use a contrastive learning objective to build a
discriminative representation space. To reflect the heterogeneous nature of
real-world data, we created and publicly released a new benchmark dataset,
ParroTao. Evaluations on both ParroTao and the public FitRec dataset show that
our model significantly outperforms existing baselines by 17% and 15%,
respectively. Furthermore, analysis of the learned representations demonstrates
their strong discriminative power, and one downstream application task confirm
the practical value of our model.

TL;DR: MoE-Health是一个新颖的混合专家框架，用于医疗保健预测中的多模态融合，能够处理不同模态的样本并提高临床任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界医疗数据通常呈现多样或不完整的模态，现有方法需要完整模态数据或依赖手动选择策略，限制了在真实临床环境中的适用性。

Method: 利用专门的专家网络和动态门控机制，根据可用数据模态动态选择和组合相关专家，实现灵活适应不同数据可用性场景。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集上的三个关键临床预测任务中，MoE-Health相比现有多模态融合方法实现了更优性能，并在不同模态可用性模式下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架有效整合多模态信息，在处理异构和不完整医疗数据方面提供改进的预测性能和鲁棒性，特别适合部署在具有异构数据可用性的多样化医疗环境中。

Abstract: Healthcare systems generate diverse multimodal data, including Electronic
Health Records (EHR), clinical notes, and medical images. Effectively
leveraging this data for clinical prediction is challenging, particularly as
real-world samples often present with varied or incomplete modalities. Existing
approaches typically require complete modality data or rely on manual selection
strategies, limiting their applicability in real-world clinical settings where
data availability varies across patients and institutions. To address these
limitations, we propose MoE-Health, a novel Mixture of Experts framework
designed for robust multimodal fusion in healthcare prediction. MoE-Health
architecture is specifically developed to handle samples with differing
modalities and improve performance on critical clinical tasks. By leveraging
specialized expert networks and a dynamic gating mechanism, our approach
dynamically selects and combines relevant experts based on available data
modalities, enabling flexible adaptation to varying data availability
scenarios. We evaluate MoE-Health on the MIMIC-IV dataset across three critical
clinical prediction tasks: in-hospital mortality prediction, long length of
stay, and hospital readmission prediction. Experimental results demonstrate
that MoE-Health achieves superior performance compared to existing multimodal
fusion methods while maintaining robustness across different modality
availability patterns. The framework effectively integrates multimodal
information, offering improved predictive performance and robustness in
handling heterogeneous and incomplete healthcare data, making it particularly
suitable for deployment in diverse healthcare environments with heterogeneous
data availability.

TL;DR: 使用QR分解提取预训练权重的正交基底，通过训练标量系数来实现极简的LoRA微调，参数数量减少601个


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准LoRA方法需要直接学习两个更新矩阵，而SVD初始化的方法计算成本高且奇异向量难以解释

Method: 采用带列主元的QR分解从预训练权重中提取正交基底，然后将LoRA更新表达为这些基底向量的线性组合，只训练标量系数

Result: 在GLUE任务上，QR-LoRA表现等同或超过全量微调、标准LoRA和SVD-LoRA，参数数量仅需601个，比全量微调减少1000倍，比标准LoRA减少77倍

Conclusion: QR-LoRA通过使用预训练权重的正交基底来结构化微调过程，在保持性能的同时实现了极简的参数效率，为大模型微调提供了一种高效的方案

Abstract: The growing scale of Large Language Models (LLMs) has necessitated the
development of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques. Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) has emerged as a promising approach, reducing the number of trainable
parameters by applying low-rank updates to pretrained weights. While standard
LoRA learns both update factors directly, several recent variants first
initialize those matrices via an SVD of the pretrained weights -- an operation
that can be expensive on large models and yields singular vectors that are not
always easy to interpret. In this work, we extract an orthonormal basis from
the pretrained weight matrix using QR decomposition with column pivoting, and
then express the LoRA update as a linear combination of these basis vectors --
training only the scalar coefficients, which imposes clear structure on
adaptation and drastically reduces parameter count. Experiments across GLUE
tasks show that QR-LoRA matches or exceeds the performance of full fine-tuning,
standard LoRA, and SVD-LoRA (LoRA with update matrices initialized via singular
value decomposition) with as few as 601 parameters -- a reduction of over 1000x
compared to full fine-tuning and 77x fewer than typical LoRA setups.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着GDPR、HIPAA等隐私法规和AI责任框架的实施，真实数据的使用面临更多限制。合成数据生成成为解决方案，但需要同时处理隐私和公平性问题。

Method: 使用Transformer-VAE加潜在扩散生成表格数据；训练时采用Rényi差分隐私约束；通过RDP兼容的平衡采样处理输入空间公平性；在潜在空间使用CKA对齐不同保护组的神经元激活模式。

Result: 实证结果表明FLIP在差分隐私约束下，能有效提升任务无关的公平性，并在多种下游任务中表现良好。

Conclusion: FLIP提供了一个在隐私保护前提下生成公平合成数据的有效框架，具有广泛的适用性，特别是在医疗等敏感领域。

Abstract: As privacy regulations such as the GDPR and HIPAA and responsibility
frameworks for artificial intelligence such as the AI Act gain traction, the
ethical and responsible use of real-world data faces increasing constraints.
Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising solution to risk-aware
data sharing and model development, particularly for tabular datasets that are
foundational to sensitive domains such as healthcare. To address both privacy
and fairness concerns in this setting, we propose FLIP (Fair Latent
Intervention under Privacy guarantees), a transformer-based variational
autoencoder augmented with latent diffusion to generate heterogeneous tabular
data. Unlike the typical setup in fairness-aware data generation, we assume a
task-agnostic setup, not reliant on a fixed, defined downstream task, thus
offering broader applicability. To ensure privacy, FLIP employs R\'enyi
differential privacy (RDP) constraints during training and addresses fairness
in the input space with RDP-compatible balanced sampling that accounts for
group-specific noise levels across multiple sampling rates. In the latent
space, we promote fairness by aligning neuron activation patterns across
protected groups using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), a similarity measure
extending the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). This alignment
encourages statistical independence between latent representations and the
protected feature. Empirical results demonstrate that FLIP effectively provides
significant fairness improvements for task-agnostic fairness and across diverse
downstream tasks under differential privacy constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型架构中的归纳偏置如何影响其在教学对话中的认知行为，特别是苏格拉底式辅导中的自适应结构化推理能力。

Method: 引入符号支架机制和短期记忆模式，通过五种系统变体的对照消融实验，使用专家设计的评分标准评估模型输出，包括支架使用、响应性、符号推理和对话记忆等方面。

Result: 完整系统在所有评估维度上一致优于基线变体，移除记忆或符号结构会显著降低关键认知行为，包括抽象能力、自适应探询和概念连续性。

Conclusion: 架构支架能够可靠地塑造大语言模型中涌现的教学策略，支持处理层面的解释，表明通过精心设计的架构可以引导模型产生更有效的教学行为。

Abstract: We study how architectural inductive biases influence the cognitive behavior
of large language models (LLMs) in instructional dialogue. We introduce a
symbolic scaffolding mechanism paired with a short-term memory schema designed
to promote adaptive, structured reasoning in Socratic tutoring. Using
controlled ablation across five system variants, we evaluate model outputs via
expert-designed rubrics covering scaffolding, responsiveness, symbolic
reasoning, and conversational memory. We present preliminary results using an
LLM-based evaluation framework aligned to a cognitively grounded rubric. This
enables scalable, systematic comparisons across architectural variants in
early-stage experimentation. The preliminary results show that our full system
consistently outperforms baseline variants. Analysis reveals that removing
memory or symbolic structure degrades key cognitive behaviors, including
abstraction, adaptive probing, and conceptual continuity. These findings
support a processing-level account in which architectural scaffolds can
reliably shape emergent instructional strategies in LLMs.

Abstract: In the past two years, large language model (LLM)-based chatbots, such as
ChatGPT, have revolutionized various domains by enabling diverse task
completion and question-answering capabilities. However, their application in
scientific research remains constrained by challenges such as hallucinations,
limited domain-specific knowledge, and lack of explainability or traceability
for the response. Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has
emerged as a promising approach to improving chatbot reliability by integrating
domain-specific contextual information before response generation, addressing
some limitations of standard LLMs. Despite its potential, there are only
limited studies that evaluate GraphRAG on specific domains that require
intensive knowledge, like Alzheimer's disease or other biomedical domains. In
this paper, we assess the quality and traceability of two popular GraphRAG
systems. We compile a database of 50 papers and 70 expert questions related to
Alzheimer's disease, construct a GraphRAG knowledge base, and employ GPT-4o as
the LLM for answering queries. We then compare the quality of responses
generated by GraphRAG with those from a standard GPT-4o model. Additionally, we
discuss and evaluate the traceability of several Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) and GraphRAG systems. Finally, we provide an easy-to-use interface with a
pre-built Alzheimer's disease database for researchers to test the performance
of both standard RAG and GraphRAG.

TL;DR: LINKO是一个基于大语言模型的集成本体学习框架，通过双轴知识传播（垂直和水平）同时利用多个医学本体图来增强医学概念表示学习，在有限数据和罕见疾病预测场景中表现出优越性能。


<details>

Conclusion: LINKO框架成功实现了跨异构本体系统的知识整合，通过双轴传播机制显著提升了医学概念表示学习效果，为EHR预测模型提供了有效的插件式解决方案。

Abstract: Medical ontology graphs map external knowledge to medical codes in electronic
health records via structured relationships. By leveraging domain-approved
connections (e.g., parent-child), predictive models can generate richer medical
concept representations by incorporating contextual information from related
concepts. However, existing literature primarily focuses on incorporating
domain knowledge from a single ontology system, or from multiple ontology
systems (e.g., diseases, drugs, and procedures) in isolation, without
integrating them into a unified learning structure. Consequently, concept
representation learning often remains limited to intra-ontology relationships,
overlooking cross-ontology connections. In this paper, we propose LINKO, a
large language model (LLM)-augmented integrative ontology learning framework
that leverages multiple ontology graphs simultaneously by enabling dual-axis
knowledge propagation both within and across heterogeneous ontology systems to
enhance medical concept representation learning. Specifically, LINKO first
employs LLMs to provide a graph-retrieval-augmented initialization for ontology
concept embedding, through an engineered prompt that includes concept
descriptions, and is further augmented with ontology context. Second, our
method jointly learns the medical concepts in diverse ontology graphs by
performing knowledge propagation in two axes: (1) intra-ontology vertical
propagation across hierarchical ontology levels and (2) inter-ontology
horizontal propagation within every level in parallel. Last, through extensive
experiments on two public datasets, we validate the superior performance of
LINKO over state-of-the-art baselines. As a plug-in encoder compatible with
existing EHR predictive models, LINKO further demonstrates enhanced robustness
in scenarios involving limited data availability and rare disease prediction.

Conclusion: TiG框架有效结合了大语言模型的世界知识和推理能力与强化学习的交互学习优势，提高了复杂交互任务的透明度和可解释性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks such as
mathematics and coding, yet they frequently struggle with simple interactive
tasks that young children perform effortlessly. This discrepancy highlights a
critical gap between declarative knowledge (knowing about something) and
procedural knowledge (knowing how to do something). Although traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) agents can acquire procedural knowledge through
environmental interaction, they often operate as black boxes and require
substantial training data. In contrast, LLMs possess extensive world knowledge
and reasoning capabilities, but are unable to effectively convert this static
knowledge into dynamic decision-making in interactive settings. To address this
challenge, we propose Think in Games (TiG), a novel framework that empowers
LLMs to develop procedural understanding through direct interaction with game
environments, while retaining their inherent reasoning and explanatory
abilities. Specifically, TiG reformulates RL-based decision-making as a
language modeling task: LLMs generate language-guided policies, which are
refined iteratively through online reinforcement learning based on
environmental feedback. Our experimental results show that TiG successfully
bridges the gap between declarative and procedural knowledge, achieving
competitive performance with dramatically lower data and computational demands
compared to conventional RL methods. Moreover, TiG provides step-by-step
natural language explanations for its decisions, greatly improving transparency
and interpretability in complex interactive tasks.

TL;DR: AHELM是一个全面的音频-语言模型基准测试，整合了多个数据集来评估10个重要方面，包括感知、推理、公平性等，并标准化了评估流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前音频-语言模型评估缺乏标准化基准，大多数基准只测试一两个能力，且不同评估使用不同的提示方法和推理参数，导致模型比较困难。

Method: 引入AHELM基准，整合各种数据集（包括2个新的合成音频-文本数据集PARADE和CoRe-Bench），标准化提示、推理参数和评估指标，测试了14个开放权重和闭源API模型以及3个基线系统。

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro在10个方面中的5个排名第一，但在ASR任务中表现出群体不公平性；基线系统表现良好，其中一个仅具有语音转文本功能的系统总体排名第5。

Conclusion: AHELM提供了一个全面的音频-语言模型评估框架，揭示了现有模型的优势和不足，特别是公平性问题，并将作为持续更新的基准测试。

Abstract: Evaluations of audio-language models (ALMs) -- multimodal models that take
interleaved audio and text as input and output text -- are hindered by the lack
of standardized benchmarks; most benchmarks measure only one or two
capabilities and omit evaluative aspects such as fairness or safety.
Furthermore, comparison across models is difficult as separate evaluations test
a limited number of models and use different prompting methods and inference
parameters. To address these shortfalls, we introduce AHELM, a benchmark that
aggregates various datasets -- including 2 new synthetic audio-text datasets
called PARADE, which evaluates the ALMs on avoiding stereotypes, and
CoRe-Bench, which measures reasoning over conversational audio through
inferential multi-turn question answering -- to holistically measure the
performance of ALMs across 10 aspects we have identified as important to the
development and usage of ALMs: audio perception, knowledge, reasoning, emotion
detection, bias, fairness, multilinguality, robustness, toxicity, and safety.
We also standardize the prompts, inference parameters, and evaluation metrics
to ensure equitable comparisons across models. We test 14 open-weight and
closed-API ALMs from 3 developers and 3 additional simple baseline systems each
consisting of an automatic speech recognizer and a language model. Our results
show that while Gemini 2.5 Pro ranks top in 5 out of 10 aspects, it exhibits
group unfairness ($p=0.01$) on ASR tasks whereas most of the other models do
not. We also find that the baseline systems perform reasonably well on AHELM,
with one ranking 5th overall despite having only speech-to-text capabilities.
For transparency, all raw prompts, model generations, and outputs are available
on our website at https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/audio/v1.0.0. AHELM is
intended to be a living benchmark and new datasets and models will be added

TL;DR: 本文从认知角度研究知识管理中的遗忘操作，提出了五种通用类型的认知遗忘，并在Spohn排序函数中实例化了七种具体遗忘操作，通过丰富的公理体系评估了这些操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的遗忘操作主要基于经典逻辑，如变量消除和AGM信念修正理论中的收缩操作，但缺乏从认知状态角度的系统研究。本文旨在在更丰富的语义结构中探索遗忘操作，建立与命题逻辑的清晰联系。

Method: 采用认知视角，在具有丰富语义结构但保持与命题逻辑联系的认知状态中研究遗忘操作。提出了五种通用类型的认知遗忘，并在Spohn排序函数中实例化了七种具体操作。借鉴逻辑编程和AGM理论中的遗忘公理，建立了全面的评估体系。

Result: 系统地评估了所有具体遗忘操作相对于所有公理的满足情况，提供了新颖的综合概览，突出了不同遗忘算子之间的差异和共性。

Conclusion: 本研究将遗忘操作提升到认知层面，为知识管理中的遗忘操作提供了更丰富的理论框架和系统评估方法，揭示了不同遗忘算子的特性和适用场景。

Abstract: Forgetting as a knowledge management operation deliberately ignores parts of
the knowledge and beliefs of an agent, for various reasons. Forgetting has many
facets, one may want to forget parts of the syntax, a proposition, or a
conditional. In the literature, two main operators suitable for performing
forgetting have been proposed and investigated in depth: First, variable
elimination is a syntactical method that blends out certain atomic variables to
focus on the rest of the language. It has been mainly used in the area of logic
programming and answer set programming. Second, contraction in AGM belief
revision theory effectively removes propositions from belief sets under logical
deduction. Both operations rely mainly on classical logics. In this article, we
take an epistemic perspective and study forgetting operations in epistemic
states with richer semantic structures, but with clear links to propositional
logic. This allows us to investigate what forgetting in the epistemic
background means, thereby lifting well-known and novel forgetting operations to
the epistemic level. We present five general types of epistemic forgetting and
instantiate them with seven concrete forgetting operations for Spohn's ranking
functions. We take inspiration from postulates of forgetting both from logic
programming and AGM theory to propose a rich landscape of axioms for evaluating
forgetting operations. Finally, we evaluate all concrete forgetting operations
according to all postulates, leading to a novel comprehensive overview
highlighting differences and commonalities among the forgetting operators.

*Niklas Jansen,Jonas Gösgens,Hector Geffner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从随机状态-动作轨迹中学习提升STRIPS模型的方法，针对滑动拼图问题，解决了状态信息不完整和动作参数缺失的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的模型学习方法大多假设动作是完整的STRIPS动作或所有域谓词都可观察，但在现实场景中，状态信息往往不完整，动作参数也不完全可见，需要更"现实"的学习设置。

Method: 引入了STRIPS+变体，允许在前提条件中隐含某些动作参数，并提出SYNTH算法，通过构建分层的前提条件表达式序列来学习STRIPS+模型。

Result: SYNTH算法被证明具有正确性和完备性，并在从现有STRIPS域派生的STRIPS+模型生成的状态-动作轨迹上测试了可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理状态信息不完整和动作参数缺失的现实学习场景，为从部分可观察数据中学习动作模型提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Consider the problem of learning a lifted STRIPS model of the sliding-tile
puzzle from random state-action traces where the states represent the location
of the tiles only, and the actions are the labels up, down, left, and right,
with no arguments. Two challenges are involved in this problem. First, the
states are not full STRIPS states, as some predicates are missing, like the
atoms representing the position of the ``blank''. Second, the actions are not
full STRIPS either, as they do not reveal all the objects involved in the
actions effects and preconditions. Previous approaches have addressed different
versions of this model learning problem, but most assume that actions in the
traces are full STRIPS actions or that the domain predicates are all
observable. The new setting considered in this work is more ``realistic'', as
the atoms observed convey the state of the world but not full STRIPS states,
and the actions reveal the arguments needed for selecting the action but not
the ones needed for modeling it in STRIPS. For formulating and addressing the
learning problem, we introduce a variant of STRIPS, which we call STRIPS+,
where certain STRIPS action arguments can be left implicit in preconditions
which can also involve a limited form of existential quantification. The
learning problem becomes the problem of learning STRIPS+ models from STRIPS+
state-action traces. For this, the proposed learning algorithm, called SYNTH,
constructs a stratified sequence (conjunction) of precondition expressions or
``queries'' for each action, that denote unique objects in the state and ground
the implicit action arguments in STRIPS+. The correctness and completeness of
SYNTH is established, and its scalability is tested on state-action traces
obtained from STRIPS+ models derived from existing STRIPS domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MMSearch-Plus是一个新的多模态搜索基准测试，包含311个需要深度视觉推理的任务，旨在解决现有基准测试中浅层工作流的问题，要求模型进行细粒度视觉理解、来源验证和长时程工具使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态浏览基准测试往往可以通过浅层的固定工作流解决，依赖于高召回率的图像搜索和邻近文本匹配，无法真正测试多模态理解能力。需要创建一个更具挑战性的基准来评估模型在细粒度视觉推理、来源验证和长时程工具使用方面的能力。

Method: 采用空间-时间外推法构建任务，每个任务包含多个弱局部视觉信号，需要通过迭代的文本-图像搜索进行提取和传播，并在检索噪声下进行交叉验证。提供了模型无关的代理框架和浏览工具。

Result: 最强代理(o3)在无搜索情况下准确率为15.1%，在框架内展开搜索后达到36.0%。最强的开源模型(Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Instruct)无搜索准确率为0.0%，经过20轮搜索后达到6.9%。错误分析显示模型在来源验证、基于部件的推理和长时程规划方面存在失败。

Conclusion: MMSearch-Plus基准测试揭示了当前多模态语言模型在复杂视觉推理任务中的局限性，特别是在需要深度多模态理解、迭代搜索和交叉验证的场景下，现有模型的表现仍有很大提升空间。

Abstract: Large multimodal language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed as web
agents, yet many multimodal browsing benchmarks can be solved by shallow, fixed
workflows that lean on high-recall image search and nearby text-masking the
genuinely multimodal challenges of fine-grained visual reasoning, provenance
verification, and long-horizon tool use. We introduce MMSearch-Plus, a
benchmark of 311 tasks that highly demand multimodal understanding while
preserving the difficulty profile of strong text-only browsing suites. Each
item is constructed to contain multiple weak, localized visual signals that
must be extracted, propagated through iterative text-image search, and
cross-validated under retrieval noise before answering. Our curation procedure,
Spatial-Temporal Extrapolation, seeds questions whose answers require
extrapolating from spatial cues (micro-text, part-level appearance, layouts,
signage) and temporal traces (broadcast overlays, seasonal context) to
out-of-image facts such as events, dates, and venues. We provide a
model-agnostic agent framework with browsing tools and evaluate a range of
closed and open MLLMs. The strongest agent (o3) attains 15.1% without search
and 36.0% accuracy with rollout under our framework, while a strong open-source
model (Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Instruct) achieves 0.0% without search and 6.9% after 20
rounds of search. Beyond answer accuracy, we assess bounding-box production and
cropped-image search, and conduct an error analysis that surfaces failures in
source verification, part-based reasoning, and long-horizon planning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于Z数的模糊推理系统，将智慧形式化为具有信心度评估的多维构造，并通过实验验证了其效度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前智慧测量依赖自我报告，缺乏谦虚和不确定性考虑，需要一种考虑多维度和信心度的计算框架来改善心理学测量并支持人道主义AI。

Method: 开发了基于Z数的模糊推理系统，每个决策都包含智慧分数（限制）和信心度分数（确定性）。通过100名参与者的图形道德困境任务和说话语言响应，将响应映射到智慧的5个理论组成部分，使用21条规则和高斯核密度估计调整的成员函数进行结合。

Result: 在概念验证研究中，系统产生的双属性智慧表征与现有量表呈现凭候但显著的相关性，与无关特质的关联微小，支持了聚合效度和区别效度。

Conclusion: 该研究将智慧形式化为具有不确定性意识的多维构造，通过Z数进行操作化。除了推动心理学测量进步外，还计算了如何用模糊Z数为AI系统提供可解释、信心敏感的推理能力，在严格计算与类人判断之间找到安全的中间地带。

Abstract: Background: Wisdom is a superordinate construct that embraces perspective
taking, reflectiveness, prosocial orientation, reflective empathetic action,
and intellectual humility. Unlike conventional models of reasoning that are
rigidly bound by binary thinking, wisdom unfolds in shades of ambiguity,
requiring both graded evaluation and self-reflective humility. Current measures
depend on self-reports and seldom reflect the humility and uncertainty inherent
in wise reasoning. A computational framework that takes into account both
multidimensionality and confidence has the potential to improve psychological
science and allow humane AI. Method: We present a fuzzy inference system with Z
numbers, each of the decisions being expressed in terms of a wisdom score
(restriction) and confidence score (certainty). As part of this study,
participants (N = 100) were exposed to culturally neutral pictorial moral
dilemma tasks to which they generated think-aloud linguistic responses, which
were mapped into five theoretically based components of wisdom. The scores of
each individual component were combined using a base of 21 rules, with
membership functions tuned via Gaussian kernel density estimation. Results: In
a proof of concept study, the system produced dual attribute wisdom
representations that correlated modestly but significantly with established
scales while showing negligible relations with unrelated traits, supporting
convergent and divergent validity. Contribution: The contribution is to
formalize wisdom as a multidimensional, uncertainty-conscious construct,
operationalized in the form of Z-numbers. In addition to progressing
measurement in psychology, it calculates how fuzzy Z numbers can provide AI
systems with interpretable, confidence-sensitive reasoning that affords a safe,
middle ground between rigorous computation and human-like judgment.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于反亏实情景的新解释范式，通过最小修改规划问题来使其满足指定属性，解决了传统反亏解释无法抓取高层次问题特性的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的反亏解释在自动规划中只关注对现有计划的最小修改，而无法抓取问题本身的高层次特性，影响故障诊断和规划特征分析。

Method: 提出两种定性的反亏情景实例化方法，通过明确量化必须满足指定属性的计划来识别对规划问题P的最小修改，使其能够接纳符合式ψ的计划。

Result: 分析了允许不同类型变更时生成反亏情景的计算复杂性，证明生成反亏情景通常只需要与为P计算计划相同的计算成本。

Conclusion: 该方法实用可行，为构建实际算法提供了框架，能够有效地为自动规划模型提供更深层次的解释能力。

Abstract: Counterfactual Explanations (CEs) are a powerful technique used to explain
Machine Learning models by showing how the input to a model should be minimally
changed for the model to produce a different output. Similar proposals have
been made in the context of Automated Planning, where CEs have been
characterised in terms of minimal modifications to an existing plan that would
result in the satisfaction of a different goal. While such explanations may
help diagnose faults and reason about the characteristics of a plan, they fail
to capture higher-level properties of the problem being solved. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel explanation paradigm that is based on
counterfactual scenarios. In particular, given a planning problem $P$ and an
\ltlf formula $\psi$ defining desired properties of a plan, counterfactual
scenarios identify minimal modifications to $P$ such that it admits plans that
comply with $\psi$. In this paper, we present two qualitative instantiations of
counterfactual scenarios based on an explicit quantification over plans that
must satisfy $\psi$. We then characterise the computational complexity of
generating such counterfactual scenarios when different types of changes are
allowed on $P$. We show that producing counterfactual scenarios is often only
as expensive as computing a plan for $P$, thus demonstrating the practical
viability of our proposal and ultimately providing a framework to construct
practical algorithms in this area.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流程挖掘在医疗领域应用面临技术复杂性高、缺乏标准化方法和实用培训资源有限等障碍，需要简化应用并提高结果的可理解性。

Method: 开发HealthProcessAI框架，包装PM4PY和bupaR库，集成多个LLM进行自动流程图解释和报告生成，使用脓毒症进展数据进行概念验证。

Result: 框架成功处理了四个概念验证场景，技术性能稳健。LLM评估显示Claude Sonnet-4和Gemini 2.5-Pro一致性得分最高（3.79/4.0和3.65/4.0）。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合结构化分析和AI驱动解释，为将复杂流程挖掘结果转化为医疗应用的可操作见解提供了新颖的方法学进展。

Abstract: Process mining has emerged as a powerful analytical technique for
understanding complex healthcare workflows. However, its application faces
significant barriers, including technical complexity, a lack of standardized
approaches, and limited access to practical training resources. We introduce
HealthProcessAI, a GenAI framework designed to simplify process mining
applications in healthcare and epidemiology by providing a comprehensive
wrapper around existing Python (PM4PY) and R (bupaR) libraries. To address
unfamiliarity and improve accessibility, the framework integrates multiple
Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated process map interpretation and
report generation, helping translate technical analyses into outputs that
diverse users can readily understand. We validated the framework using sepsis
progression data as a proof-of-concept example and compared the outputs of five
state-of-the-art LLM models through the OpenRouter platform. To test its
functionality, the framework successfully processed sepsis data across four
proof-of-concept scenarios, demonstrating robust technical performance and its
capability to generate reports through automated LLM analysis. LLM evaluation
using five independent LLMs as automated evaluators revealed distinct model
strengths: Claude Sonnet-4 and Gemini 2.5-Pro achieved the highest consistency
scores (3.79/4.0 and 3.65/4.0) when evaluated by automated LLM assessors. By
integrating multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated interpretation
and report generation, the framework addresses widespread unfamiliarity with
process mining outputs, making them more accessible to clinicians, data
scientists, and researchers. This structured analytics and AI-driven
interpretation combination represents a novel methodological advance in
translating complex process mining results into potentially actionable insights
for healthcare applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种跨领域自动发现通用地标的新框架，通过状态函数学习重复模式，构建有向通用地标图来指导规划问题求解


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统地标提取算法在处理具有重复子计划的规划问题时表现不佳，需要一种能够捕捉领域重复模式并自动泛化的方法

Method: 使用状态函数学习独立于具体对象的地标，构建有向通用地标图来描述地标进展和循环可能性，并基于此开发启发式算法

Result: 实验表明，从少量小实例学习到的通用地标图对同一领域的大实例也有效，当识别到重复循环时，启发式性能相比基线有显著提升

Conclusion: 通用地标能够捕获可解释的领域信息，这些信息可以从同一领域的少量计划中自动发现，对自动化规划器非常有用

Abstract: We propose a new framework for discovering landmarks that automatically
generalize across a domain. These generalized landmarks are learned from a set
of solved instances and describe intermediate goals for planning problems where
traditional landmark extraction algorithms fall short. Our generalized
landmarks extend beyond the predicates of a domain by using state functions
that are independent of the objects of a specific problem and apply to all
similar objects, thus capturing repetition. Based on these functions, we
construct a directed generalized landmark graph that defines the landmark
progression, including loop possibilities for repetitive subplans. We show how
to use this graph in a heuristic to solve new problem instances of the same
domain. Our results show that the generalized landmark graphs learned from a
few small instances are also effective for larger instances in the same domain.
If a loop that indicates repetition is identified, we see a significant
improvement in heuristic performance over the baseline. Generalized landmarks
capture domain information that is interpretable and useful to an automated
planner. This information can be discovered from a small set of plans for the
same domain.

Motivation: 许多高层次多智能体规划问题（如多机器人导航）可以用确定性动作和观察有效建模，但现有Dec-POMDP求解器无法高效处理大规模问题

Method: 基于经典联合均衡搜索策略框架，提出了迭代确定性POMDP规划（IDPP）方法，专门针对确定性转移和观察的大规模Det-Dec-POMDPs进行优化

Result: IDPP方法能够处理当前Dec-POMDP求解器无法高效解决的大规模确定性分散POMDP问题

Conclusion: Det-Dec-POMDPs为多智能体规划提供了有效的建模框架，IDPP方法为此类问题提供了实用的求解方案

Abstract: Many high-level multi-agent planning problems, including multi-robot
navigation and path planning, can be effectively modeled using deterministic
actions and observations.
  In this work, we focus on such domains and introduce the class of
Deterministic Decentralized POMDPs (Det-Dec-POMDPs). This is a subclass of
Dec-POMDPs characterized by deterministic transitions and observations
conditioned on the state and joint actions.
  We then propose a practical solver called Iterative Deterministic POMDP
Planning (IDPP). This method builds on the classic Joint Equilibrium Search for
Policies framework and is specifically optimized to handle large-scale
Det-Dec-POMDPs that current Dec-POMDP solvers are unable to address
efficiently.

Abstract: This paper presents an integrated framework that combines traditional network
optimization models with large language models (LLMs) to deliver interactive,
explainable, and role-aware decision support for supply chain planning. The
proposed system bridges the gap between complex operations research outputs and
business stakeholder understanding by generating natural language summaries,
contextual visualizations, and tailored key performance indicators (KPIs). The
core optimization model addresses tactical inventory redistribution across a
network of distribution centers for multi-period and multi-item, using a
mixed-integer formulation. The technical architecture incorporates AI agents,
RESTful APIs, and a dynamic user interface to support real-time interaction,
configuration updates, and simulation-based insights. A case study demonstrates
how the system improves planning outcomes by preventing stockouts, reducing
costs, and maintaining service levels. Future extensions include integrating
private LLMs, transfer learning, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian neural
networks to enhance explainability, adaptability, and real-time
decision-making.

Motivation: MHA*虽然利用多个不可采纳启发式函数加速搜索，但无法随时间改进解质量，需要仔细设置膨胀因子来获得一次性解

Method: 受ARA*算法启发，将ARA*的概念精确适配到MHA*框架中，开发随时版本A-MHA*

Result: 在3D路径规划和滑块拼图领域验证性能，与MHA*和其他随时算法进行比较

Conclusion: A-MHA*成功扩展了MHA*的随时能力，保持了原有的理论保证，并在实际应用中表现出色

Abstract: Designing good heuristic functions for graph search requires adequate domain
knowledge. It is often easy to design heuristics that perform well and
correlate with the underlying true cost-to-go values in certain parts of the
search space but these may not be admissible throughout the domain thereby
affecting the optimality guarantees of the search. Bounded suboptimal search
using several such partially good but inadmissible heuristics was developed in
Multi-Heuristic A* (MHA*). Although MHA* leverages multiple inadmissible
heuristics to potentially generate a faster suboptimal solution, the original
version does not improve the solution over time. It is a one shot algorithm
that requires careful setting of inflation factors to obtain a desired one time
solution. In this work, we tackle this issue by extending MHA* to an anytime
version that finds a feasible suboptimal solution quickly and continually
improves it until time runs out. Our work is inspired from the Anytime
Repairing A* (ARA*) algorithm. We prove that our precise adaptation of ARA*
concepts in the MHA* framework preserves the original suboptimal and
completeness guarantees and enhances MHA* to perform in an anytime fashion.
Furthermore, we report the performance of A-MHA* in 3-D path planning domain
and sliding tiles puzzle and compare against MHA* and other anytime algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为AI偏见是需要消除的缺陷，但人类推理本身就包含偏见。研究认为AI中的偏见可能是不可避免且有价值的，需要新的方法来利用这种多样性。

Method: 开发MEDLEY概念框架，协调30多个大型语言模型，保留共识和少数观点，将模型特定偏见记录为优势，幻觉作为临床医生验证的临时假设。

Result: 概念验证演示器在合成病例中成功保留了共识和少数观点，使诊断不确定性和潜在偏见对临床监督透明可见。

Conclusion: MEDLEY通过重新定义AI不完美性为资源，提供了范式转变，为开发可信医疗AI系统开辟了新的监管、伦理和创新途径。

Abstract: Bias in medical artificial intelligence is conventionally viewed as a defect
requiring elimination. However, human reasoning inherently incorporates biases
shaped by education, culture, and experience, suggesting their presence may be
inevitable and potentially valuable. We propose MEDLEY (Medical Ensemble
Diagnostic system with Leveraged diversitY), a conceptual framework that
orchestrates multiple AI models while preserving their diverse outputs rather
than collapsing them into a consensus. Unlike traditional approaches that
suppress disagreement, MEDLEY documents model-specific biases as potential
strengths and treats hallucinations as provisional hypotheses for clinician
verification. A proof-of-concept demonstrator was developed using over 30 large
language models, creating a minimum viable product that preserved both
consensus and minority views in synthetic cases, making diagnostic uncertainty
and latent biases transparent for clinical oversight. While not yet a validated
clinical tool, the demonstration illustrates how structured diversity can
enhance medical reasoning under clinician supervision. By reframing AI
imperfection as a resource, MEDLEY offers a paradigm shift that opens new
regulatory, ethical, and innovation pathways for developing trustworthy medical
AI systems.

Motivation: 现有方法大多忽视科学文档的层次结构以及文本和视觉元素的语义整合，需要一种能够直接解决这两个挑战的新方法。

Method: 提出Poster Tree分层中间表示，采用多智能体协作策略（内容摘要和布局规划智能体），通过迭代协调和相互反馈实现联合优化。

Result: 在多个学术领域的实验中，该方法在定性和定量评估上均优于现有基线，生成的海报质量最接近专家设计水平，具有更好的信息保留、结构清晰度和用户偏好。

Conclusion: PosterForest框架成功解决了科学海报生成中的结构层次和语义整合问题，为自动化科学海报生成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a novel training-free framework, \textit{PosterForest}, for
automated scientific poster generation. Unlike prior approaches, which largely
neglect the hierarchical structure of scientific documents and the semantic
integration of textual and visual elements, our method addresses both
challenges directly. We introduce the \textit{Poster Tree}, a hierarchical
intermediate representation that jointly encodes document structure and
visual-textual relationships at multiple levels. Our framework employs a
multi-agent collaboration strategy, where agents specializing in content
summarization and layout planning iteratively coordinate and provide mutual
feedback. This approach enables the joint optimization of logical consistency,
content fidelity, and visual coherence. Extensive experiments on multiple
academic domains show that our method outperforms existing baselines in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The resulting posters achieve quality
closest to expert-designed ground truth and deliver superior information
preservation, structural clarity, and user preference.

Problem (TSP) that combines (i) a compact encoding of permutations, which
reduces the qubit requirement too, (ii) an optimize-freeze-reuse strategy:
where the circuit topology (``Ansatz'') is first optimized on a training
instance by Simulated Annealing (SA), then ``frozen'' and re-used on novel
instances, limited to a rapid re-optimization of only the circuit parameters.
This pipeline eliminates costly structural research in testing, making the
procedure immediately implementable on NISQ hardware.
  On a set of $40$ randomly generated symmetric instances that span $4 - 7$
cities, the resulting Ansatz achieves an average optimal trip sampling
probability of $100\%$ for 4 city cases, $90\%$ for 5 city cases and $80\%$ for
6 city cases. With 7 cities the success rate drops markedly to an average of
$\sim 20\%$, revealing the onset of scalability limitations of the proposed
method.
  The results show robust generalization ability for moderate problem sizes and
indicate how freezing the Ansatz can dramatically reduce time-to-solution
without degrading solution quality. The paper also discusses scalability
limitations, the impact of ``warm-start'' initialization of parameters, and
prospects for extension to more complex problems, such as Vehicle Routing and
Job-Shop Scheduling.

TL;DR: 本文提出了在给定摘要因果图背景知识下，保证时间变量间微观层面边可定向性的条件，为复杂时间系统中的因果发现提供理论保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列分析中理解时间变量间的因果关系是一个核心挑战，特别是在完整因果结构未知的情况下。专家通常能够提供摘要因果图来捕捉主要因果关系，但如何利用这种高层抽象来指导微观层面的因果发现需要理论支持。

Method: 提出了在假设存在忠实且因果充分的分布条件下，基于摘要因果图的背景知识来保证微观层面边可定向性的理论条件。这些条件即使在宏观层面存在循环或双向边的情况下也适用。

Result: 建立了微观层面边定向的理论保证，证明了在给定摘要因果图的情况下，即使宏观层面存在复杂结构（如循环或双向边），微观层面的因果边仍然可以被正确定向。

Conclusion: 研究结果为利用摘要因果图来指导复杂时间系统中的因果发现提供了实用的理论指导，强调了将专家知识融入观测时间序列数据分析中以改进因果推理的价值。

Abstract: Understanding causal relations between temporal variables is a central
challenge in time series analysis, particularly when the full causal structure
is unknown. Even when the full causal structure cannot be fully specified,
experts often succeed in providing a high-level abstraction of the causal
graph, known as a summary causal graph, which captures the main causal
relations between different time series while abstracting away micro-level
details. In this work, we present conditions that guarantee the orientability
of micro-level edges between temporal variables given the background knowledge
encoded in a summary causal graph and assuming having access to a faithful and
causally sufficient distribution with respect to the true unknown graph. Our
results provide theoretical guarantees for edge orientation at the micro-level,
even in the presence of cycles or bidirected edges at the macro-level. These
findings offer practical guidance for leveraging SCGs to inform causal
discovery in complex temporal systems and highlight the value of incorporating
expert knowledge to improve causal inference from observational time series
data.

### [176] [Tree-Guided Diffusion Planner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21800)
*Hyeonseong Jeon,Cheolhong Min,Jaesik Park*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Tree-guided Diffusion Planner (TDP)，一种零样本测试时规划框架，通过树搜索和双层采样过程解决非凸、不可微和多奖励场景下的规划问题，在多个任务上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的规划方法在凸可微奖励场景下表现良好，但在现实世界的非凸目标、不可微约束和多奖励结构中效果显著下降。有监督规划方法需要任务特定训练，限制了测试时灵活性和零样本泛化能力。

Method: TDP将测试时规划构建为树搜索问题，采用双层采样过程：1) 通过无训练粒子引导生成多样化父轨迹以鼓励广泛探索；2) 通过任务目标引导的快速条件去噪精炼子轨迹。仅使用预训练模型和测试时奖励信号。

Result: 在三个不同任务上评估：迷宫金币收集、机械臂方块操作和AntMaze多目标探索。TDP在所有任务上一致优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: TDP通过树引导的扩散规划有效解决了梯度引导的局限性，能够在扩展的解空间中探索多样化轨迹区域并利用梯度信息，实现了更好的零样本测试时规划性能。

Abstract: Planning with pretrained diffusion models has emerged as a promising approach
for solving test-time guided control problems. However, standard gradient
guidance typically performs optimally under convex and differentiable reward
landscapes, showing substantially reduced effectiveness in real-world scenarios
involving non-convex objectives, non-differentiable constraints, and
multi-reward structures. Furthermore, recent supervised planning approaches
require task-specific training or value estimators, which limits test-time
flexibility and zero-shot generalization. We propose a Tree-guided Diffusion
Planner (TDP), a zero-shot test-time planning framework that balances
exploration and exploitation through structured trajectory generation. We frame
test-time planning as a tree search problem using a bi-level sampling process:
(1) diverse parent trajectories are produced via training-free particle
guidance to encourage broad exploration, and (2) sub-trajectories are refined
through fast conditional denoising guided by task objectives. TDP addresses the
limitations of gradient guidance by exploring diverse trajectory regions and
harnessing gradient information across this expanded solution space using only
pretrained models and test-time reward signals. We evaluate TDP on three
diverse tasks: maze gold-picking, robot arm block manipulation, and AntMaze
multi-goal exploration. TDP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on all tasks. The project page can be found at:

TL;DR: 通过模拟临床会议团队的协作诊断过程，提出了一种动态多段代理系统，在SOAP病历识别临床问题方面显著提升了性能和稳健性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床文档解释对患者护理至关重要，但单一模型方法在高风险临床任务中缺乏足够的稳健性。需要更准确、可解释的临床决策支持工具

Method: 设计了一种协作多段代理系统(MAS)，模拟临床会议团队。Manager代理组织动态分配的专科代理团队，进行层次化、迭代性辩论以达成共识。系统仅分析SOAP病历中的S和O部分

Result: 在420份MIMIC-III病历数据集上评估，动态多段配置在识别凑急性心力衰竭、急性肾伤伤和感染性伤病方面显示了持续改善的性能。质性分析显示该结构能有效揭示和衡量冲突证据

Conclusion: 通过模拟临床团队的推理过程，该系统为开发更准确、稳健和可解释的临床决策支持工具提供了有前景的路径，尽管有时可能存在群体思维的风险

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of clinical narratives is critical for patient care,
but the complexity of these notes makes automation challenging. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) show promise, single-model approaches can lack the
robustness required for high-stakes clinical tasks. We introduce a
collaborative multi-agent system (MAS) that models a clinical consultation team
to address this gap. The system is tasked with identifying clinical problems by
analyzing only the Subjective (S) and Objective (O) sections of SOAP notes,
simulating the diagnostic reasoning process of synthesizing raw data into an
assessment. A Manager agent orchestrates a dynamically assigned team of
specialist agents who engage in a hierarchical, iterative debate to reach a
consensus. We evaluated our MAS against a single-agent baseline on a curated
dataset of 420 MIMIC-III notes. The dynamic multi-agent configuration
demonstrated consistently improved performance in identifying congestive heart
failure, acute kidney injury, and sepsis. Qualitative analysis of the agent
debates reveals that this structure effectively surfaces and weighs conflicting
evidence, though it can occasionally be susceptible to groupthink. By modeling
a clinical team's reasoning process, our system offers a promising path toward
more accurate, robust, and interpretable clinical decision support tools.

TL;DR: 本文提出利用检索增强生成(RAG)技术增强大型语言模型(LLMs)来改进量子软件系统的模型到代码转换，通过从GitHub获取Qiskit代码样本，实验显示精心设计的提示可将CodeBLEU分数提高四倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子混合软件系统开发面临异构平台和开发者技能缺乏的挑战，模型驱动方法可以降低成本和风险。

Method: 采用检索增强生成(RAG)管道，从公开GitHub仓库收集Qiskit代码样本，通过精心设计的提示工程生成量子代码。

Result: 实验结果表明，良好设计的提示可以将CodeBLEU分数提高多达四倍，产生更准确和一致的量子代码。

Conclusion: 该方法为量子软件模型到代码转换提供了有效途径，未来可进一步探索将软件系统模型实例作为RAG信息源，以及代码到代码转换等应用场景。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel research direction for model-to-text/code
transformations by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) that can be enhanced
with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. The focus is on quantum
and hybrid quantum-classical software systems, where model-driven approaches
can help reduce the costs and mitigate the risks associated with the
heterogeneous platform landscape and lack of developers' skills. We validate
one of the proposed ideas regarding generating code out of UML model instances
of software systems. This Python code uses a well-established library, called
Qiskit, to execute on gate-based or circuit-based quantum computers. The RAG
pipeline that we deploy incorporates sample Qiskit code from public GitHub
repositories. Experimental results show that well-engineered prompts can
improve CodeBLEU scores by up to a factor of four, yielding more accurate and
consistent quantum code. However, the proposed research direction can go beyond
this through further investigation in the future by conducting experiments to
address our other research questions and ideas proposed here, such as deploying
software system model instances as the source of information in the RAG
pipelines, or deploying LLMs for code-to-code transformations, for instance,
for transpilation use cases.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: UTR是一种通过对抗性学习训练LLM生成高质量单元测试的新题强化学习框架，通过测试生成器和代码生成器的循环对抗提升测试质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前使用LLM自动生成单元测试的方法不成熟，需要一种有效的训练方法来生成高质量的测试案例

Method: 设计了对抗性强化学习框架UTR，同时训练测试生成器和代码生成器两个LLM，测试生成器获得辨别奖励（更好地曝露代码错误），代码生成器获得代码奖励（更好地通过测试）

Result: UTR训练的Qwen3-4B模型生成的单元测试质量超过了同模型的监督学习版本，甚至超过GPT-4.1等领先模型

Conclusion: UTR框架通过对抗性学习方式有效提升了LLM生成单元测试的质量，为自动化测试生成提供了新的训练方法

Abstract: Unit testing is a core practice in programming, enabling systematic
evaluation of programs produced by human developers or large language models
(LLMs). Given the challenges in writing comprehensive unit tests, LLMs have
been employed to automate test generation, yet methods for training LLMs to
produce high-quality tests remain underexplored. In this work, we propose UTRL,
a novel reinforcement learning framework that trains an LLM to generate
high-quality unit tests given a programming instruction. Our key idea is to
iteratively train two LLMs, the unit test generator and the code generator, in
an adversarial manner via reinforcement learning. The unit test generator is
trained to maximize a discrimination reward, which reflects its ability to
produce tests that expose faults in the code generator's solutions, and the
code generator is trained to maximize a code reward, which reflects its ability
to produce solutions that pass the unit tests generated by the test generator.
In our experiments, we demonstrate that unit tests generated by Qwen3-4B
trained via UTRL show higher quality compared to unit tests generated by the
same model trained via supervised fine-tuning on human-written ground-truth
unit tests, yielding code evaluations that more closely align with those
induced by the ground-truth tests. Moreover, Qwen3-4B trained with UTRL
outperforms frontier models such as GPT-4.1 in generating high-quality unit
tests, highlighting the effectiveness of UTRL in training LLMs for this task.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出基于指令调优大语言模型的轻量级bug分配框架，使用LoRA适配器和候选约束解码，在EclipseJDT和Mozilla数据集上表现出良好的短名单质量，Top-10命中率达0.753


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型项目中的bug分配任务通常缓慢且不一致，需要一种更高效、实用的解决方案来替代成本高昂的特征工程和基于图的方法

Method: 使用指令调优的大语言模型，结合LoRA适配器进行微调，采用候选约束解码确保分配的有效性

Result: 在EclipseJDT和Mozilla数据集上，模型表现出强大的短名单质量（Hit@10达到0.753），尽管Top-1准确率一般。在最新快照上准确率显著提升

Conclusion: 指令调优的大语言模型为bug分配任务提供了实用的替代方案，具有在现实世界人机协作场景中的应用潜力

Abstract: Bug triaging, the task of assigning new issues to developers, is often slow
and inconsistent in large projects. We present a lightweight framework that
instruction-tuned large language model (LLM) with LoRA adapters and uses
candidate-constrained decoding to ensure valid assignments. Tested on
EclipseJDT and Mozilla datasets, the model achieves strong shortlist quality
(Hit at 10 up to 0.753) despite modest exact Top-1 accuracy. On recent
snapshots, accuracy rises sharply, showing the framework's potential for
real-world, human-in-the-loop triaging. Our results suggest that
instruction-tuned LLMs offer a practical alternative to costly feature
engineering and graph-based methods.

*Tobias Lindenbauer,Igor Slinko,Ludwig Felder,Egor Bogomolov,Yaroslav Zharov*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 在SWE-agent任务中，简单的观察屏蔽策略比复杂的LLM摘要方法更有效且成本更低，性能相当甚至略优


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在处理复杂任务时会产生长上下文历史，现有SE代理使用LLM摘要来应对，但不确定这种复杂性是否真正带来性能优势

Method: 在SWE-agent上对SWE-bench Verified进行系统比较，测试五种模型配置下的观察屏蔽策略与LLM摘要策略

Result: 观察屏蔽策略将成本减半，同时解决率与摘要方法相当甚至略高（如Qwen3-Coder 480B从53.8%提升至54.8%）

Conclusion: 在SWE-agent环境中，最简单有效的上下文管理策略就是观察屏蔽，复杂摘要方法并未带来明显优势

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents solve complex tasks through iterative
reasoning, exploration, and tool-use, a process that can result in long,
expensive context histories. While state-of-the-art Software Engineering ( SE)
agents like OpenHands or Cursor use LLM-based summarization to tackle this
issue, it is unclear whether the increased complexity offers tangible
performance benefits compared to simply omitting older observations. We present
a systematic comparison of these strategies within SWE-agent on SWE-bench
Verified across five diverse model configurations. We find that a simple
observation-masking strategy halves cost relative to a raw agent while
matching, and sometimes slightly exceeding, the solve rate of LLM
summarization. For example, with Qwen3-Coder 480B, masking improves solve rate
from 53.8% (raw agent) to 54.8%, while remaining competitive with summarization
at a lower cost. These results suggest that, at least within SWE-agent on
SWE-bench Verified, the most effective and efficient context management can be
the simplest. We release code and data for reproducibility

TL;DR: LMPA是一个将大语言模型(LLMs)集成到指针分析中的新框架，通过LLM增强语义理解，提高分析精度和可扩展性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指针分析框架由于对代码语义理解不足，导致对用户定义函数的处理过于保守，传播错误事实。LLMs的发展为解决这一问题提供了新机遇

Method: LMPA识别类似系统API的用户定义函数并进行相应建模，减少错误的跨调用上下文传播；通过推断初始点集和引入基于自然语言的摘要策略来增强基于摘要的分析

Result: 论文提出了LMPA的愿景框架，但未提供具体实验结果（从摘要看是概念性论文）

Conclusion: LMPA展示了LLMs在指针分析中的潜力，通过语义理解增强可以显著提升分析质量，论文还讨论了实现这一愿景的关键挑战

Abstract: Pointer analysis has been studied for over four decades. However, existing
frameworks continue to suffer from the propagation of incorrect facts. A major
limitation stems from their insufficient semantic understanding of code,
resulting in overly conservative treatment of user-defined functions. Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) present new opportunities to bridge
this gap. In this paper, we propose LMPA (LLM-enhanced Pointer Analysis), a
vision that integrates LLMs into pointer analysis to enhance both precision and
scalability. LMPA identifies user-defined functions that resemble system APIs
and models them accordingly, thereby mitigating erroneous cross-calling-context
propagation. Furthermore, it enhances summary-based analysis by inferring
initial points-to sets and introducing a novel summary strategy augmented with
natural language. Finally, we discuss the key challenges involved in realizing
this vision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL策略测试方法生成的测试套件针对特定策略定制，对其他策略的相关性不明确，需要一种能够提取可重用、策略无关测试用例的方法

Method: 使用一组策略基于难度分数从候选池中选择测试用例，采用受质量-多样性算法启发的离散化通用测试用例描述符表面来促进测试套件多样性

Result: 评估了难度分数的有效性，分析了方法效果和成本与策略数量的关系，检验了多样性方法对状态空间的覆盖和触发故障行为的能力

Conclusion: MPTCS能够选择出揭示代理行为典型缺陷的多样化、可重用策略无关测试用例，为RL策略验证提供了有效的测试套件选择方法

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) agents show great promise in solving sequential
decision-making tasks. However, validating the reliability and performance of
the agent policies' behavior for deployment remains challenging. Most
reinforcement learning policy testing methods produce test suites tailored to
the agent policy being tested, and their relevance to other policies is
unclear. This work presents Multi-Policy Test Case Selection (MPTCS), a novel
automated test suite selection method for RL environments, designed to extract
test cases generated by any policy testing framework based on their
solvability, diversity, and general difficulty. MPTCS uses a set of policies to
select a diverse collection of reusable policy-agnostic test cases that reveal
typical flaws in the agents' behavior. The set of policies selects test cases
from a candidate pool, which can be generated by any policy testing method,
based on a difficulty score. We assess the effectiveness of the difficulty
score and how the method's effectiveness and cost depend on the number of
policies in the set. Additionally, a method for promoting diversity in the test
suite, a discretized general test case descriptor surface inspired by
quality-diversity algorithms, is examined to determine how it covers the state
space and which policies it triggers to produce faulty behaviors.

Method: 评估超过50万个Python和Java代码样本，使用正交缺陷分类法分析代码缺陷，使用通用弱点枚举分析安全漏洞

Result: AI生成代码更简单重复但包含更多未使用结构和硬编码调试，人类代码结构更复杂但可维护性问题更多，AI代码包含更多高风险安全漏洞

Conclusion: AI和人类编写的代码具有不同的缺陷特征，需要在AI辅助编程中采用专门的质量保证实践

Abstract: As AI code assistants become increasingly integrated into software
development workflows, understanding how their code compares to human-written
programs is critical for ensuring reliability, maintainability, and security.
In this paper, we present a large-scale comparison of code authored by human
developers and three state-of-the-art LLMs, i.e., ChatGPT, DeepSeek-Coder, and
Qwen-Coder, on multiple dimensions of software quality: code defects, security
vulnerabilities, and structural complexity. Our evaluation spans over 500k code
samples in two widely used languages, Python and Java, classifying defects via
Orthogonal Defect Classification and security vulnerabilities using the Common
Weakness Enumeration. We find that AI-generated code is generally simpler and
more repetitive, yet more prone to unused constructs and hardcoded debugging,
while human-written code exhibits greater structural complexity and a higher
concentration of maintainability issues. Notably, AI-generated code also
contains more high-risk security vulnerabilities. These findings highlight the
distinct defect profiles of AI- and human-authored code and underscore the need
for specialized quality assurance practices in AI-assisted programming.

Abstract: The demand for rapid software delivery in the Information Technology (IT)
industry has significantly intensified, emphasising the need for faster
software products and service releases with enhanced features to meet customer
expectations. Agile methodologies are replacing traditional approaches such as
Waterfall, where flexibility, iterative development and adaptation to change
are favoured over rigid planning and execution. DevOps, a subsequent evolution
from Agile, emphasises collaborative efforts in development and operations
teams, focusing on continuous integration and deployment to deliver resilient
and high-quality software products and services. This study aims to critically
assess both Agile and DevOps practices in the IT industry to identify the
feasibility and applicability of Agile methods in DevOps practices. Eleven
semi-structured interviews were conducted with Agile and DevOps practitioners
in varying capacities across several sectors within the IT industry. Through
thematic analysis, 51 unique codes were extracted and synthesised into 19
themes that reported on each phase of the DevOps lifecycle, specifically
regarding the integration and implementation of Agile methods into DevOps
practices. Based on the findings, a new understanding detailing the
interrelationship of Agile methods in DevOps practices was discussed that met
the research objectives.

Motivation: 超参数优化对推荐系统性能至关重要，但现有研究往往将其视为中性或次要问题。本研究旨在审计广泛使用的RecBole推荐框架的行为，揭示隐藏的框架逻辑对实验结果的影响。

Method: 使用六个模型和两个数据集，比较不同搜索策略，量化性能方差和搜索路径不稳定性。重点分析RecBole的内部默认设置，特别是未文档化的早停策略对随机搜索和贝叶斯优化的影响。

Result: 发现RecBole的隐藏框架逻辑会过早终止超参数搜索，限制搜索覆盖范围，引入的实验变异性与不同搜索策略间的差异相当。用户无法察觉这种限制。

Conclusion: 研究强调需要将框架视为实验设计的主动组成部分，呼吁在推荐系统研究中开发更透明、可复现的工具。提供了可操作的建议来减轻隐藏配置行为的影响，提高超参数调优工作流程的透明度。

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization is critical for improving the performance of
recommender systems, yet its implementation is often treated as a neutral or
secondary concern. In this work, we shift focus from model benchmarking to
auditing the behavior of RecBole, a widely used recommendation framework. We
show that RecBole's internal defaults, particularly an undocumented
early-stopping policy, can prematurely terminate Random Search and Bayesian
Optimization. This limits search coverage in ways that are not visible to
users. Using six models and two datasets, we compare search strategies and
quantify both performance variance and search path instability. Our findings
reveal that hidden framework logic can introduce variability comparable to the
differences between search strategies. These results highlight the importance
of treating frameworks as active components of experimental design and call for
more transparent, reproducibility-aware tooling in recommender systems
research. We provide actionable recommendations for researchers and developers
to mitigate hidden configuration behaviors and improve the transparency of
hyperparameter tuning workflows.

Method: 结合Double和Dueling深度Q网络（DQN）与矩阵分解模型，通过强化学习从稀疏反馈中动态学习用户偏好。

Result: 在大型电商数据集上相比基于流行度和主动学习等传统方法表现更优，特别是Dueling DQN显著降低了冷启动用户的均方根误差（RMSE）。

Conclusion: 该方法为隐私受限环境下的冷启动用户推荐问题提供了有效的解决方案，证明了强化学习在推荐系统中的实用价值。

Abstract: Recommender systems struggle to provide accurate suggestions to new users
with limited interaction history, a challenge known as the cold-user problem.
This paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach using Double and Dueling
Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to dynamically learn user preferences from sparse

demographic data. By integrating these advanced DQN variants with a matrix
factorization model, we achieve superior performance on a large e-commerce
dataset compared to traditional methods like popularity-based and active
learning strategies. Experimental results show that our method, particularly
Dueling DQN, reduces Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for cold users, offering an
effective solution for privacy-constrained environments.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型存在两个主要问题：1) 响应过于通用，缺乏个性化定制；2) 依赖云端基础设施，导致网络依赖和响应延迟。需要同时解决个性化和设备端部署的问题

Method: 利用云端LLM的强大泛化能力增强用户有限的个人数据，使用真实和合成数据通过参数高效微调(PEFT)模块训练个性化设备端语言模型，部署在用户本地设备上

Result: 在广泛使用的个性化基准测试的六个任务上验证了CDCDA-PLM的有效性

Conclusion: CDCDA-PLM框架成功实现了个性化设备端语言模型的部署，消除了对网络稳定性的依赖并确保了高响应速度

Abstract: With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), significant progress
has been achieved in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However,
existing LLMs still face two major challenges that hinder their broader
adoption: (1) their responses tend to be generic and lack personalization
tailored to individual users, and (2) they rely heavily on cloud infrastructure
due to intensive computational requirements, leading to stable network
dependency and response delay. Recent research has predominantly focused on
either developing cloud-based personalized LLMs or exploring the on-device
deployment of general-purpose LLMs. However, few studies have addressed both
limitations simultaneously by investigating personalized on-device language
models. To bridge this gap, we propose CDCDA-PLM, a framework for deploying
personalized on-device language models on user devices with support from a
powerful cloud-based LLM. Specifically, CDCDA-PLM leverages the server-side
LLM's strong generalization capabilities to augment users' limited personal
data, mitigating the issue of data scarcity. Using both real and synthetic
data, A personalized on-device language models (LMs) is fine-tuned via
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) modules and deployed on users' local
devices, enabling them to process queries without depending on cloud-based
LLMs. This approach eliminates reliance on network stability and ensures high
response speeds. Experimental results across six tasks in a widely used
personalization benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of CDCDA-PLM.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了推荐系统中群体公平性和个体公平性之间的关系，发现高度群体公平的推荐可能对个体非常不公平


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推荐系统公平性研究中，群体公平和个体公平使用不同的评估指标和目标，缺乏对两者关系的科学理解，无法比较两种公平性类型之间的相互影响

Method: 通过对可用于两种公平性类型的评估措施进行全面比较，在3个数据集上对8个运行进行了实验分析

Result: 实验表明，高度公平的群体推荐可能对个体非常不公平

Conclusion: 这一发现对旨在提高推荐系统公平性的从业者具有新颖性和实用性，揭示了群体公平和个体公平之间的潜在冲突关系

Abstract: Fairness in recommender systems (RSs) is commonly categorised into group
fairness and individual fairness. However, there is no established scientific
understanding of the relationship between the two fairness types, as prior work
on both types has used different evaluation measures or evaluation objectives
for each fairness type, thereby not allowing for a proper comparison of the
two. As a result, it is currently not known how increasing one type of fairness
may affect the other. To fill this gap, we study the relationship of group and
individual fairness through a comprehensive comparison of evaluation measures
that can be used for both fairness types. Our experiments with 8 runs across 3
datasets show that recommendations that are highly fair for groups can be very
unfair for individuals. Our finding is novel and useful for RS practitioners
aiming to improve the fairness of their systems. Our code is available at:

Abstract: Comprehensive evaluation of the recommendation capabilities of existing
foundation models across diverse datasets and domains is essential for
advancing the development of recommendation foundation models. In this study,
we introduce RecBench-MD, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to
assess the recommendation abilities of foundation models from a zero-resource,

*Xiaoxi Cui,Weihai Lu,Yu Tong,Yiheng Li,Zhejun Zhao*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出Diff-MSIN框架，通过多模态特征增强、协同关系捕获和动态自适应融合三个模块，解决多模态CTR预测中模态间共性和特性分离不足的问题，在多个数据集上取得显著效果提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CTR预测方法主要基于ID模态，无法全面建模用户的多模态偏好。现有的多模态融合方法存在两个问题：(1)未能有效分离不同模态间的共性和特性；(2)未考虑模态间的协同效应和复杂交互。

Method: 提出Diff-MSIN框架，包含三个创新模块：多模态特征增强(MFE)模块、协同关系捕获(SRC)模块和特征动态自适应融合(FDAF)模块。MFE和SRC模块提取模态间的协同、共性和特殊信息，FDAF模块捕获用户偏好并减少融合噪声。还设计了知识解耦方法以增强特征区分性。

Result: 在Rec-Tmall和三个Amazon数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比基线至少提升1.67%，显著改善了多模态推荐系统的性能。

Conclusion: Diff-MSIN框架有效解决了多模态CTR预测中的模态融合问题，通过创新的模块设计实现了更好的特征表示和融合效果，为多模态推荐系统提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In click-through rate prediction, click-through rate prediction is used to
model users' interests. However, most of the existing CTR prediction methods
are mainly based on the ID modality. As a result, they are unable to
comprehensively model users' multi-modal preferences. Therefore, it is
necessary to introduce multi-modal CTR prediction. Although it seems appealing
to directly apply the existing multi-modal fusion methods to click-through rate
prediction models, these methods (1) fail to effectively disentangle
commonalities and specificities across different modalities; (2) fail to
consider the synergistic effects between modalities and model the complex
interactions between modalities.
  To address the above issues, this paper proposes the Diffusion-based
Multi-modal Synergy Interest Network (Diff-MSIN) framework for click-through
prediction. This framework introduces three innovative modules: the Multi-modal
Feature Enhancement (MFE) Module Synergistic Relationship Capture (SRC) Module,
and the Feature Dynamic Adaptive Fusion (FDAF) Module. The MFE Module and SRC
Module extract synergistic, common, and special information among different
modalities. They effectively enhances the representation of the modalities,
improving the overall quality of the fusion. To encourage distinctiveness among
different features, we design a Knowledge Decoupling method. Additionally, the
FDAF Module focuses on capturing user preferences and reducing fusion noise. To
validate the effectiveness of the Diff-MSIN framework, we conducted extensive
experiments using the Rec-Tmall and three Amazon datasets. The results
demonstrate that our approach yields a significant improvement of at least
1.67% compared to the baseline, highlighting its potential for enhancing
multi-modal recommendation systems. Our code is available at the following

Motivation: 从数字化历史地图中提取的向量特征需要结构化组织，以支持高效访问和使用。问题回答系统能让不熟悉数据库查询语言的用户以自然直观的方式获取知识。

Method: 集成基于历史地图数据构建的时空知识图与大语言模型，定义本体论指导KG构建，研究两种GeoQA工作流程（事实性和描述性），并整合历史地图图像和网络搜索结果作为额外上下文。

Result: 系统能够以高传达率和高语义准确性生成答案，开发的网络应用支持交互式查询和可视化功能。

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了一个基于知识图和大语言模型的地理问题回答系统，能够高效地利用历史地图数据并为用户提供自然的知识获取方式，具有强大的应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances have enabled the extraction of vectorized features from
digital historical maps. To fully leverage this information, however, the
extracted features must be organized in a structured and meaningful way that
supports efficient access and use. One promising approach is question answering
(QA), which allows users -- especially those unfamiliar with database query
languages -- to retrieve knowledge in a natural and intuitive manner. In this
project, we developed a GeoQA system by integrating a spatio-temporal knowledge
graph (KG) constructed from historical map data with large language models
(LLMs). Specifically, we have defined the ontology to guide the construction of
the spatio-temporal KG and investigated workflows of two different types of
GeoQA: factual and descriptive. Additional data sources, such as historical map
images and internet search results, are incorporated into our framework to
provide extra context for descriptive GeoQA. Evaluation results demonstrate
that the system can generate answers with a high delivery rate and a high
semantic accuracy. To make the framework accessible, we further developed a web
application that supports interactive querying and visualization.

Abstract: Reproducing and comparing results in news recommendation research has become
increasingly difficult. This is due to a fragmented ecosystem of diverse
codebases, varied configurations, and mainly due to resource-intensive models.
We introduce NewsReX, an open-source library designed to streamline this
process. Our key contribution is a modern implementation built on Keras 3 and
JAX, which provides an increase in computational efficiency. Experiments show
that NewsReX is faster than current implementations. To support broader
research, we provide a straightforward guide and scripts for training models on
custom datasets. We validated this functionality using a proprietary Japanese
news dataset from Nikkei News, a leading Japanese media corporation renowned
for its comprehensive coverage of business, economic, and financial news.
NewsReX makes reproducing complex experiments faster and more accessible to a
wider range of hardware making sure the speed up it also achieved for less
powerful GPUs, like an 8GB RTX 3060 Ti. Beyond the library, this paper offers
an analysis of key training parameters often overlooked in the literature,
including the effect of different negative sampling strategies, the varying
number of epochs, the impact of random batching, and more. This supplementary
analysis serves as a valuable reference for future research, aiming to reduce
redundant computation when comparing baselines and guide best practices. Code

TL;DR: 两塔模型在实际应用中遇到性能下降问题，本文通过理论分析和实验验证了记录政策和模型可识别性对模型性能的影响，并提出样本加权技术来减少偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业界常用的加性两塔模型在使用生产系统收集的点击数据训练时，出现排名性能下降的惊人现象，需要探索其根本原因和解决方案。

Method: 通过理论分析两塔模型的可识别性条件，研究记录政策对模型偏差的影响，并提出样本加权技术来减缓这些问题。

Result: 证明了要从点击数据恢复模型参数，需要文档在位置间交换或特征分布重叠。记录政策在模型完美描述用户行为时不会引入偏差，但在模型不完美时会放大偏差，尤其是当预测错误与文档位置相关时。

Conclusion: 两塔模型的性能下降主要由于记录政策放大了模型的不完美性，根本解决方案是通过样本加权技术来减少偏差，为研究人员和实践者提供了可操作的建议。

Abstract: Additive two-tower models are popular learning-to-rank methods for handling
biased user feedback in industry settings. Recent studies, however, report a
concerning phenomenon: training two-tower models on clicks collected by
well-performing production systems leads to decreased ranking performance. This
paper investigates two recent explanations for this observation: confounding
effects from logging policies and model identifiability issues. We
theoretically analyze the identifiability conditions of two-tower models,
showing that either document swaps across positions or overlapping feature
distributions are required to recover model parameters from clicks. We also
investigate the effect of logging policies on two-tower models, finding that
they introduce no bias when models perfectly capture user behavior. However,
logging policies can amplify biases when models imperfectly capture user
behavior, particularly when prediction errors correlate with document placement
across positions. We propose a sample weighting technique to mitigate these
effects and provide actionable insights for researchers and practitioners using
two-tower models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于主题的局部可检索性度量方法(T-Retrievability)，通过计算主题相关文档组的可检索性分数来更准确地评估检索模型的曝光公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的可检索性分数在整个集合上的不均匀分布可能无法准确反映曝光偏差，而是反映了主题相关性的变化。需要一种更细粒度的度量方法来评估检索模型的曝光公平性。

Method: 提出T-Retrievability方法：首先计算多个主题相关文档组的可检索性分数，然后聚合这些局部值获得集合级统计量。

Result: 使用T-Retrievability度量分析发现，该方法能够揭示各种神经排序模型的曝光特征新见解，提供对曝光公平性更细致的理解。

Conclusion: 局部化度量方法为评估IR系统中文档可访问性提供了更可靠的方法，能够更准确地反映检索模型的曝光公平性。

Abstract: Retrievability of a document is a collection-based statistic that measures
its expected (reciprocal) rank of being retrieved within a specific rank
cut-off. A collection with uniformly distributed retrievability scores across
documents is an indicator of fair document exposure. While retrievability
scores have been used to quantify the fairness of exposure for a collection, in
our work, we use the distribution of retrievability scores to measure the
exposure bias of retrieval models. We hypothesise that an uneven distribution
of retrievability scores across the entire collection may not accurately
reflect exposure bias but rather indicate variations in topical relevance. As a
solution, we propose a topic-focused localised retrievability measure, which we
call \textit{T-Retrievability} (topic-retrievability), which first computes
retrievability scores over multiple groups of topically-related documents, and
then aggregates these localised values to obtain the collection-level
statistics. Our analysis using this proposed T-Retrievability measure uncovers
new insights into the exposure characteristics of various neural ranking
models. The findings suggest that this localised measure provides a more
nuanced understanding of exposure fairness, offering a more reliable approach
for assessing document accessibility in IR systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期用户行为序列导致计算成本高、模型训练和推理效率低的问题，传统两阶段方法对序列上下文利用不完整，多模态嵌入与现有大推荐模型存在架构不匹配问题

Method: 提出Deep Multimodal Group Interest Network (DMGIN)，利用多模态大语言模型对用户点击后行为序列进行分组重组，减少计算开销。通过关注组内关注和组间关注来捕捉用户兴趣特征和演化过程

Result: 在工业和公共数据集上验证了方法的有效性和效率，A/B测试显示在LBS广告系统中CTR提升4.7%，每千次展示收入2.3%

Conclusion: DMGIN通过创新的分组方式有效解决了长期用户行为序列的计算效率问题，同时保持了多模态信息的利用，在实际应用中取得了显著的效果提升

Abstract: Modeling user interest based on lifelong user behavior sequences is crucial
for enhancing Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction. However, long post-click
behavior sequences themselves pose severe performance issues: the sheer volume
of data leads to high computational costs and inefficiencies in model training
and inference. Traditional methods address this by introducing two-stage
approaches, but this compromises model effectiveness due to incomplete
utilization of the full sequence context. More importantly, integrating
multimodal embeddings into existing large recommendation models (LRM) presents
significant challenges: These embeddings often exacerbate computational burdens
and mismatch with LRM architectures. To address these issues and enhance the
model's efficiency and accuracy, we introduce Deep Multimodal Group Interest
Network (DMGIN). Given the observation that user post-click behavior sequences
contain a large number of repeated items with varying behaviors and timestamps,
DMGIN employs Multimodal LLMs(MLLM) for grouping to reorganize complete
lifelong post-click behavior sequences more effectively, with almost no
additional computational overhead, as opposed to directly introducing
multimodal embeddings. To mitigate the potential information loss from
grouping, we have implemented two key strategies. First, we analyze behaviors
within each group using both interest statistics and intra-group transformers
to capture group traits. Second, apply inter-group transformers to temporally
ordered groups to capture the evolution of user group interests. Our extensive
experiments on both industrial and public datasets confirm the effectiveness
and efficiency of DMGIN. The A/B test in our LBS advertising system shows that
DMGIN improves CTR by 4.7% and Revenue per Mile by 2.3%.
