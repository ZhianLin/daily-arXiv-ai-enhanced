### [1] [AdSum: Two-stream Audio-visual Summarization for Automated Video Advertisement Clipping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26569)
*Wen Xie,Yanjun Zhu,Gijs Overgoor,Yakov Bart,Agata Lapedriza Garcia,Sarah Ostadabbas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个自动化视频广告剪辑框架，将视频剪辑视为针对广告的镜头选择问题，强调音频的重要性，并开发了双流音视频融合模型来预测帧的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统广告制作需要手动从长视频广告中选择和重新编辑镜头来创建短版本，这既费时又费力。

Method: 开发了一个双流音视频融合模型来预测视频帧的重要性，其中重要性定义为帧被选入公司制作的短广告的可能性。

Result: 在AdSum204数据集上的广泛实验表明，该模型在平均精度、曲线下面积、Spearman和Kendall等各种指标上优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 该框架成功地将视频剪辑问题转化为针对广告的镜头选择问题，并通过音视频融合模型显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Advertisers commonly need multiple versions of the same advertisement (ad) at
varying durations for a single campaign. The traditional approach involves
manually selecting and re-editing shots from longer video ads to create shorter
versions, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we
introduce a framework for automated video ad clipping using video summarization
techniques. We are the first to frame video clipping as a shot selection
problem, tailored specifically for advertising. Unlike existing general video
summarization methods that primarily focus on visual content, our approach
emphasizes the critical role of audio in advertising. To achieve this, we
develop a two-stream audio-visual fusion model that predicts the importance of
video frames, where importance is defined as the likelihood of a frame being
selected in the firm-produced short ad. To address the lack of ad-specific
datasets, we present AdSum204, a novel dataset comprising 102 pairs of
30-second and 15-second ads from real advertising campaigns. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various metrics, including Average Precision, Area Under Curve,
Spearman, and Kendall.

### [2] [Enhancing Underwater Object Detection through Spatio-Temporal Analysis and Spatial Attention Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25797)
*Sai Likhith Karri,Ansh Saxena*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了时空建模和空间注意力机制在深度学习模型中对水下物体检测的有效性。通过比较标准YOLOv5、时间增强的T-YOLOv5以及添加CBAM注意力模块的T-YOLOv5，发现在动态海洋环境中，时间建模能显著提升检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决水下物体检测在动态海洋环境中的挑战，特别是在突然运动、部分遮挡和渐变运动条件下，传统检测模型精度不足的问题。

Method: 第一阶段评估时间增强的T-YOLOv5与标准YOLOv5的性能对比；第二阶段开发了添加卷积块注意力模块(CBAM)的T-YOLOv5增强版本。

Result: 测试结果显示：YOLOv5的mAP@50-95为0.563，T-YOLOv5为0.813，T-YOLOv5+CBAM为0.811。时间增强模型显著优于标准模型，而添加CBAM在复杂场景中进一步提升了性能。

Conclusion: T-YOLOv5相比标准模型显著提高了检测可靠性，T-YOLOv5+CBAM在挑战性场景中表现更优，但在简单场景中会有精度损失。

Abstract: This study examines the effectiveness of spatio-temporal modeling and the
integration of spatial attention mechanisms in deep learning models for
underwater object detection. Specifically, in the first phase, the performance
of temporal-enhanced YOLOv5 variant T-YOLOv5 is evaluated, in comparison with
the standard YOLOv5. For the second phase, an augmented version of T-YOLOv5 is
developed, through the addition of a Convolutional Block Attention Module
(CBAM). By examining the effectiveness of the already pre-existing YOLOv5 and
T-YOLOv5 models and of the newly developed T-YOLOv5 with CBAM. With CBAM, the
research highlights how temporal modeling improves detection accuracy in
dynamic marine environments, particularly under conditions of sudden movements,
partial occlusions, and gradual motion. The testing results showed that YOLOv5
achieved a mAP@50-95 of 0.563, while T-YOLOv5 and T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
outperformed with mAP@50-95 scores of 0.813 and 0.811, respectively,
highlighting their superior accuracy and generalization in detecting complex
objects. The findings demonstrate that T-YOLOv5 significantly enhances
detection reliability compared to the standard model, while T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
further improves performance in challenging scenarios, although there is a loss
of accuracy when it comes to simpler scenarios.

### [3] [MIRO: MultI-Reward cOnditioned pretraining improves T2I quality and efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25897)
*Nicolas Dufour,Lucas Degeorge,Arijit Ghosh,Vicky Kalogeiton,David Picard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIRO方法通过在训练过程中直接让模型学习多个奖励模型的条件，显著提升了生成图像的视觉质量并加速了训练，在多个评估基准上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像生成模型在大规模未筛选数据集上训练以实现多样化生成能力，但这与用户偏好不一致。现有的奖励模型通过后处理选择生成图像来对齐奖励，但会损害多样性、语义保真度和效率。

Method: 提出MIRO方法，在训练过程中让模型直接学习多个奖励模型的条件，而不是采用后处理方式。

Result: MIRO在GenEval组合基准和用户偏好评分（PickAScore、ImageReward、HPSv2）上实现了最先进的性能，显著提升了生成图像的视觉质量并加速了训练。

Conclusion: 通过在训练中直接学习多个奖励模型的条件，可以更好地对齐用户偏好，同时保持生成质量和效率。

Abstract: Current text-to-image generative models are trained on large uncurated
datasets to enable diverse generation capabilities. However, this does not
align well with user preferences. Recently, reward models have been
specifically designed to perform post-hoc selection of generated images and
align them to a reward, typically user preference. This discarding of
informative data together with the optimizing for a single reward tend to harm
diversity, semantic fidelity and efficiency. Instead of this post-processing,
we propose to condition the model on multiple reward models during training to
let the model learn user preferences directly. We show that this not only
dramatically improves the visual quality of the generated images but it also
significantly speeds up the training. Our proposed method, called MIRO,
achieves state-of-the-art performances on the GenEval compositional benchmark
and user-preference scores (PickAScore, ImageReward, HPSv2).

### [4] [BikeScenes: Online LiDAR Semantic Segmentation for Bicycles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25901)
*Denniz Goren,Holger Caesar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发针对自行车的3D LiDAR分割方法，通过BikeScenes数据集实现从汽车领域到自行车领域的适应，显著提升分割性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电动自行车日益普及带来的安全隐患，需要将汽车感知技术适配到自行车安全领域

Method: 使用多传感器SenseBike研究平台，创建BikeScenes-lidarseg数据集（3021个连续LiDAR扫描），包含29个动态和静态类别，通过微调方法进行领域适应

Result: 在BikeScenes数据集上微调后达到63.6%的平均交并比，显著优于仅使用SemanticKITTI预训练的13.8%

Conclusion: 领域特定训练对于自行车感知系统至关重要，BikeScenes数据集为自行车为中心的LiDAR分割研究提供了重要资源

Abstract: The vulnerability of cyclists, exacerbated by the rising popularity of faster
e-bikes, motivates adapting automotive perception technologies for bicycle
safety. We use our multi-sensor 'SenseBike' research platform to develop and
evaluate a 3D LiDAR segmentation approach tailored to bicycles. To bridge the
automotive-to-bicycle domain gap, we introduce the novel BikeScenes-lidarseg
Dataset, comprising 3021 consecutive LiDAR scans around the university campus
of the TU Delft, semantically annotated for 29 dynamic and static classes. By
evaluating model performance, we demonstrate that fine-tuning on our BikeScenes
dataset achieves a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 63.6%, significantly
outperforming the 13.8% obtained with SemanticKITTI pre-training alone. This
result underscores the necessity and effectiveness of domain-specific training.
We highlight key challenges specific to bicycle-mounted, hardware-constrained
perception systems and contribute the BikeScenes dataset as a resource for
advancing research in cyclist-centric LiDAR segmentation.

### [5] [Generative Image Restoration and Super-Resolution using Physics-Informed Synthetic Data for Scanning Tunneling Microscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25921)
*Nikola L. Kolev,Tommaso Rodani,Neil J. Curson,Taylor J. Z. Stock,Alberto Cazzaniga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于机器学习的STM图像修复和超分辨率方法，使用少量实验图像和物理信息合成数据训练模型，有效恢复图像质量并减少2-4倍采集时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决STM技术中针尖退化和缓慢串行数据采集的限制，减少针尖调节频率并提高实验吞吐量。

Method: 使用仅36张原始实验图像，通过物理信息合成数据生成管道训练先进的流匹配和扩散模型。

Result: 模型能有效修复图像，通过稀疏采样数据准确重建图像，实现2-4倍的图像采集时间减少。

Conclusion: 该框架有潜力显著提高STM实验吞吐量，减少针尖调节频率并增强现有高速STM系统的帧率。

Abstract: Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) enables atomic-resolution imaging and
atom manipulation, but its utility is often limited by tip degradation and slow
serial data acquisition. Fabrication adds another layer of complexity since the
tip is often subjected to large voltages, which may alter the shape of its
apex, requiring it to be conditioned. Here, we propose a machine learning (ML)
approach for image repair and super-resolution to alleviate both challenges.
Using a dataset of only 36 pristine experimental images of Si(001):H, we
demonstrate that a physics-informed synthetic data generation pipeline can be
used to train several state-of-the-art flow-matching and diffusion models.
Quantitative evaluation with metrics such as the CLIP Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(CMMD) score and structural similarity demonstrates that our models are able to
effectively restore images and offer a two- to fourfold reduction in image
acquisition time by accurately reconstructing images from sparsely sampled
data. Our framework has the potential to significantly increase STM
experimental throughput by offering a route to reducing the frequency of
tip-conditioning procedures and to enhancing frame rates in existing high-speed
STM systems.

### [6] [SplitFlow: Flow Decomposition for Inversion-Free Text-to-Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25970)
*Sung-Hoon Yoon,Minghan Li,Gaspard Beaudouin,Congcong Wen,Muhammad Rafay Azhar,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于流分解与聚合的无反演图像编辑框架，通过语义分解目标提示词、计算独立子流并自适应聚合，解决了现有整流流模型在图像编辑中的反转不准确和梯度纠缠问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 整流流模型在图像生成中表现优异，但在图像编辑任务中存在局限性：反转过程不准确导致真实图像难以映射到潜在空间，编辑过程中的梯度纠缠问题使得输出无法忠实反映目标提示。

Method: 提出流分解与聚合框架：语义分解目标提示词为多个子提示，为每个子提示计算独立流，通过投影和软聚合机制自适应加权子目标速度场，抑制语义冗余并强调不同方向。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在语义保真度和属性解耦方面优于现有的零样本编辑方法。

Conclusion: 通过流分解与聚合的无反演框架有效提升了图像编辑的质量，在保持多样性的同时确保了语义一致性。

Abstract: Rectified flow models have become a de facto standard in image generation due
to their stable sampling trajectories and high-fidelity outputs. Despite their
strong generative capabilities, they face critical limitations in image editing
tasks: inaccurate inversion processes for mapping real images back into the
latent space, and gradient entanglement issues during editing often result in
outputs that do not faithfully reflect the target prompt. Recent efforts have
attempted to directly map source and target distributions via ODE-based
approaches without inversion; however,these methods still yield suboptimal
editing quality. In this work, we propose a flow decomposition-and-aggregation
framework built upon an inversion-free formulation to address these
limitations. Specifically, we semantically decompose the target prompt into
multiple sub-prompts, compute an independent flow for each, and aggregate them
to form a unified editing trajectory. While we empirically observe that
decomposing the original flow enhances diversity in the target space,
generating semantically aligned outputs still requires consistent guidance
toward the full target prompt. To this end, we design a projection and
soft-aggregation mechanism for flow, inspired by gradient conflict resolution
in multi-task learning. This approach adaptively weights the sub-target
velocity fields, suppressing semantic redundancy while emphasizing distinct
directions, thereby preserving both diversity and consistency in the final
edited output. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing zero-shot editing approaches in terms of semantic fidelity and
attribute disentanglement. The code is available at
https://github.com/Harvard-AI-and-Robotics-Lab/SplitFlow.

### [7] [Brain-IT: Image Reconstruction from fMRI via Brain-Interaction Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25976)
*Roman Beliy,Amit Zalcher,Jonathan Kogman,Navve Wasserman,Michal Irani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Brain-IT方法，通过脑交互Transformer从fMRI脑记录重建视觉图像，在有限数据下实现更忠实和高效的重建


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散模型的fMRI图像重建方法缺乏对实际所见图像的忠实度，需要更有效的脑功能交互机制

Method: 使用脑交互Transformer(BIT)实现功能相似脑体素簇之间的交互，预测高层次语义特征和低层次结构特征来引导扩散模型

Result: 在视觉和客观指标上超越当前SOTA方法，仅用1小时fMRI数据就能达到与40小时训练相当的效果

Conclusion: Brain-IT通过脑功能簇交互和双特征预测机制，实现了更忠实高效的fMRI图像重建

Abstract: Reconstructing images seen by people from their fMRI brain recordings
provides a non-invasive window into the human brain. Despite recent progress
enabled by diffusion models, current methods often lack faithfulness to the
actual seen images. We present "Brain-IT", a brain-inspired approach that
addresses this challenge through a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT),
allowing effective interactions between clusters of functionally-similar
brain-voxels. These functional-clusters are shared by all subjects, serving as
building blocks for integrating information both within and across brains. All
model components are shared by all clusters & subjects, allowing efficient
training with a limited amount of data. To guide the image reconstruction, BIT
predicts two complementary localized patch-level image features: (i)high-level
semantic features which steer the diffusion model toward the correct semantic
content of the image; and (ii)low-level structural features which help to
initialize the diffusion process with the correct coarse layout of the image.
BIT's design enables direct flow of information from brain-voxel clusters to
localized image features. Through these principles, our method achieves image
reconstructions from fMRI that faithfully reconstruct the seen images, and
surpass current SotA approaches both visually and by standard objective
metrics. Moreover, with only 1-hour of fMRI data from a new subject, we achieve
results comparable to current methods trained on full 40-hour recordings.

*Valentin Boussot,Cédric Hémon,Jean-Claude Nunes,Jean-Louis Dillenseger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文针对TrackRAD2025挑战赛，在数据稀缺条件下开发实时肿瘤跟踪方法，最终采用基于SAM 2.1基础模型的分割方法，在隐藏测试集上获得0.8794的Dice分数，排名第6。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在胸腹部cine-MRI序列中实时肿瘤跟踪的挑战，特别是在强数据稀缺约束下，为MRI引导的放射治疗提供准确跟踪方案。

Method: 探索了两种策略：无监督配准和使用SAM 2.1基础模型的分割方法。最终选择SAM 2.1 b+变体，使用第一标注切片的掩码提示进行微调，采用平衡的Dice+IoU损失函数和低学习率训练策略。

Result: 在TrackRAD2025隐藏测试集上获得0.8794的Dice相似系数，总体排名第6位，证明了基础模型在实时MRI肿瘤跟踪中的有效性。

Conclusion: 基础模型在MRI引导放射治疗的实时肿瘤跟踪中具有强大潜力，能够在数据稀缺条件下实现准确跟踪。

Abstract: In this work, we address the TrackRAD2025 challenge of real-time tumor
tracking in cine-MRI sequences of the thoracic and abdominal regions under
strong data scarcity constraints. Two complementary strategies were explored:
(i) unsupervised registration with the IMPACT similarity metric and (ii)
foundation model-based segmentation leveraging SAM 2.1 and its recent variants
through prompt-based interaction. Due to the one-second runtime constraint, the
SAM-based method was ultimately selected. The final configuration used SAM2.1
b+ with mask-based prompts from the first annotated slice, fine-tuned solely on
the small labeled subset from TrackRAD2025. Training was configured to minimize
overfitting, using 1024x1024 patches (batch size 1), standard augmentations,
and a balanced Dice + IoU loss. A low uniform learning rate (0.0001) was
applied to all modules (prompt encoder, decoder, Hiera backbone) to preserve
generalization while adapting to annotator-specific styles. Training lasted 300
epochs (~12h on RTX A6000, 48GB). The same inference strategy was consistently
applied across all anatomical sites and MRI field strengths. Test-time
augmentation was considered but ultimately discarded due to negligible
performance gains. The final model was selected based on the highest Dice
Similarity Coefficient achieved on the validation set after fine-tuning. On the
hidden test set, the model reached a Dice score of 0.8794, ranking 6th overall
in the TrackRAD2025 challenge. These results highlight the strong potential of
foundation models for accurate and real-time tumor tracking in MRI-guided
radiotherapy.

### [9] [Larger Hausdorff Dimension in Scanning Pattern Facilitates Mamba-Based Methods in Low-Light Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26001)
*Xinhua Wang,Caibo Feng,Xiangjun Fu,Chunxiao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Hilbert选择性扫描机制的Mamba框架增强方法，通过增加扫描模式的Hausdorff维度来更有效地探索特征空间，提升低光图像增强性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Mamba框架在低光图像增强中存在信息不一致和空间局部性不足的问题，需要更有效的特征空间探索机制来捕捉精细细节。

Method: 引入Hilbert选择性扫描机制，增加扫描模式的Hausdorff维度，改进空间局部性以更好地捕捉局部交互，同时保持处理长程依赖的能力。

Result: 在公开基准测试中显著提升了定量指标和定性视觉保真度，同时减少了计算资源消耗和推理时间。

Conclusion: 该策略不仅推进了低光图像增强的最新技术，还为更广泛的Mamba基技术应用领域带来了前景。

Abstract: We propose an innovative enhancement to the Mamba framework by increasing the
Hausdorff dimension of its scanning pattern through a novel Hilbert Selective
Scan mechanism. This mechanism explores the feature space more effectively,
capturing intricate fine-scale details and improving overall coverage. As a
result, it mitigates information inconsistencies while refining spatial
locality to better capture subtle local interactions without sacrificing the
model's ability to handle long-range dependencies. Extensive experiments on
publicly available benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves both the quantitative metrics and qualitative visual fidelity of
existing Mamba-based low-light image enhancement methods, all while reducing
computational resource consumption and shortening inference time. We believe
that this refined strategy not only advances the state-of-the-art in low-light
image enhancement but also holds promise for broader applications in fields
that leverage Mamba-based techniques.

TL;DR: CAVE是首个真实世界视觉异常基准，支持异常描述、解释和论证三个开放任务，为评估视觉语言模型在异常检测和理解方面提供认知科学启发的综合框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前计算机视觉中异常检测仅限于工业缺陷或合成异常的问题，捕捉真实世界异常的丰富性和不可预测性。

Method: 构建CAVE基准数据集，包含细粒度标注的视觉定位和异常分类，基于异常视觉表现、复杂性、严重性和常见性进行分类，灵感来自认知科学研究。

Result: 实验表明，即使采用先进提示策略，最先进的视觉语言模型在视觉异常感知和常识推理方面仍存在困难。

Conclusion: CAVE作为现实且认知基础的基准，为推进异常检测和常识推理研究提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify, reason about, and explain anomalies in their
environment. In computer vision, this long-standing challenge remains limited
to industrial defects or unrealistic, synthetically generated anomalies,
failing to capture the richness and unpredictability of real-world anomalies.
In this work, we introduce CAVE, the first benchmark of real-world visual
anomalies. CAVE supports three open-ended tasks: anomaly description,
explanation, and justification; with fine-grained annotations for visual
grounding and categorizing anomalies based on their visual manifestations,
their complexity, severity, and commonness. These annotations draw inspiration
from cognitive science research on how humans identify and resolve anomalies,
providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) in detecting and understanding anomalies. We show that state-of-the-art
VLMs struggle with visual anomaly perception and commonsense reasoning, even
with advanced prompting strategies. By offering a realistic and cognitively
grounded benchmark, CAVE serves as a valuable resource for advancing research
in anomaly detection and commonsense reasoning in VLMs.

Conclusion: 该方法具有作为沿海洪水管理可扩展实用工具的潜力，能够帮助决策者制定有效的缓解策略以应对气候变化日益增长的影响。

Abstract: Climate change and sea-level rise (SLR) pose escalating threats to coastal
cities, intensifying the need for efficient and accurate methods to predict
potential flood hazards. Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic simulators,
although precise, are computationally expensive and impractical for city-scale
coastal planning applications. Deep Learning (DL) techniques offer promising
alternatives, however, they are often constrained by challenges such as data
scarcity and high-dimensional output requirements. Leveraging a recently
proposed vision-based, low-resource DL framework, we develop a novel,
lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model designed to predict
coastal flooding under variable SLR projections and shoreline adaptation
scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of the model to generalize
across diverse geographical contexts by utilizing datasets from two distinct
regions: Abu Dhabi and San Francisco. Our findings demonstrate that the
proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing the
mean absolute error (MAE) in predicted flood depth maps on average by nearly
20%. These results highlight the potential of our approach to serve as a
scalable and practical tool for coastal flood management, empowering
decision-makers to develop effective mitigation strategies in response to the
growing impacts of climate change. Project Page: https://caspiannet.github.io/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频大语言模型在理解复杂时序动态方面存在严重局限性，难以处理需要详细理解动作序列和时序进展的任务

Method: 在视觉编码器中直接引入堆叠时序注意力模块，通过时序注意力机制使模型在将视觉token传递给LLM之前更好地捕捉动作进展和帧间关系

Result: 该方法显著改善了时序推理能力，在视频问答任务特别是动作识别方面优于现有模型，在VITATECS、MVBench和Video-MME等基准上性能提升达5.5%

Conclusion: 通过在视觉编码器中增强时序结构，解决了Video-LLMs在视频理解方面的关键差距

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
understanding complex temporal dynamics in videos remains a major challenge.
Our experiments show that current Video Large Language Model (Video-LLM)
architectures have critical limitations in temporal understanding, struggling
with tasks that require detailed comprehension of action sequences and temporal
progression. In this work, we propose a Video-LLM architecture that introduces
stacked temporal attention modules directly within the vision encoder. This
design incorporates a temporal attention in vision encoder, enabling the model
to better capture the progression of actions and the relationships between
frames before passing visual tokens to the LLM. Our results show that this
approach significantly improves temporal reasoning and outperforms existing
models in video question answering tasks, specifically in action recognition.
We improve on benchmarks including VITATECS, MVBench, and Video-MME by up to
+5.5%. By enhancing the vision encoder with temporal structure, we address a
critical gap in video understanding for Video-LLMs. Project page and code are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了FlexICL框架，用于超声图像中骨骼区域的少样本分割，仅需5%的训练图像就能在四个手腕和肘部超声数据集上实现鲁棒分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决儿科肘部和手腕骨折超声图像分割中专家标注耗时且成本高的问题，为轻训练用户提供实时反馈和关键结构突出显示。

Method: 提出FlexICL框架，采用上下文学习(ICL)方法，系统研究图像拼接技术和训练策略，引入新颖的拼接方法增强模型性能。

Result: 在1,252个超声扫描上，FlexICL比Painter、MAE-VQGAN等最先进的视觉ICL模型以及U-Net、TransUNet等传统分割模型的Dice系数高出1-27%。

Conclusion: FlexICL为超声图像分割提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，特别适用于标注数据稀缺的医学成像应用场景。

Abstract: Elbow and wrist fractures are the most common fractures in pediatric
populations. Automatic segmentation of musculoskeletal structures in ultrasound
(US) can improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. Fractures appear
as cortical defects but require expert interpretation. Deep learning (DL) can
provide real-time feedback and highlight key structures, helping lightly
trained users perform exams more confidently. However, pixel-wise expert
annotations for training remain time-consuming and costly. To address this
challenge, we propose FlexICL, a novel and flexible in-context learning (ICL)
framework for segmenting bony regions in US images. We apply it to an
intra-video segmentation setting, where experts annotate only a small subset of
frames, and the model segments unseen frames. We systematically investigate
various image concatenation techniques and training strategies for visual ICL
and introduce novel concatenation methods that significantly enhance model
performance with limited labeled data. By integrating multiple augmentation
strategies, FlexICL achieves robust segmentation performance across four wrist
and elbow US datasets while requiring only 5% of the training images. It
outperforms state-of-the-art visual ICL models like Painter, MAE-VQGAN, and
conventional segmentation models like U-Net and TransUNet by 1-27% Dice
coefficient on 1,252 US sweeps. These initial results highlight the potential
of FlexICL as an efficient and scalable solution for US image segmentation well
suited for medical imaging use cases where labeled data is scarce.

models that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to adaptively generate
negative prompts during the denoising process. Unlike traditional Negative
Prompting methods that use fixed negative prompts, our method generates
intermediate image predictions at specific denoising steps and queries a VLM to
produce contextually appropriate negative prompts. We evaluate our approach on
various benchmark datasets and demonstrate the trade-offs between negative
guidance strength and text-image alignment.

### [15] [Security Risk of Misalignment between Text and Image in Multi-modal Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26105)
*Xiaosen Wang,Zhijin Ge,Shaokang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为PReMA的新型多模态攻击方法，通过仅修改输入图像而不改变文本提示，就能操纵多模态扩散模型生成不当内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态扩散模型在文本和图像模态之间的对齐存在不足，这种不对齐带来了显著风险，特别是在生成不当或NSFW内容方面。

Method: 提出Prompt-Restricted Multi-modal Attack (PReMA)攻击方法，通过修改输入图像来操纵生成内容，而不改变文本提示本身。

Result: 在图像修复和风格迁移任务上的综合评估证实了PReMA的强大效力，能够有效操纵模型输出。

Conclusion: PReMA对多模态扩散模型的完整性构成了新的威胁，特别是在使用固定提示的图像编辑应用中。

Abstract: Despite the notable advancements and versatility of multi-modal diffusion
models, such as text-to-image models, their susceptibility to adversarial
inputs remains underexplored. Contrary to expectations, our investigations
reveal that the alignment between textual and Image modalities in existing
diffusion models is inadequate. This misalignment presents significant risks,
especially in the generation of inappropriate or Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW)
content. To this end, we propose a novel attack called Prompt-Restricted
Multi-modal Attack (PReMA) to manipulate the generated content by modifying the
input image in conjunction with any specified prompt, without altering the
prompt itself. PReMA is the first attack that manipulates model outputs by
solely creating adversarial images, distinguishing itself from prior methods
that primarily generate adversarial prompts to produce NSFW content.
Consequently, PReMA poses a novel threat to the integrity of multi-modal
diffusion models, particularly in image-editing applications that operate with
fixed prompts. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on image inpainting and
style transfer tasks across various models confirm the potent efficacy of
PReMA.

*Minjoon Jung,Junbin Xiao,Junghyun Kim,Byoung-Tak Zhang,Angela Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了EgoExo-Con基准，评估视频LLM在多视角时间理解中的一致性，发现现有模型存在一致性不足的问题，并提出View-GRPO强化学习框架来提升跨视角一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视频LLM在不同视角下对同一事件的时间理解是否一致，现有模型在多视角一致性方面存在明显不足。

Method: 引入EgoExo-Con基准，包含同步的第一人称和第三人称视频对，评估时间验证和时间定位任务；提出View-GRPO强化学习框架，增强视角特定的时间推理并促进跨视角一致性理解。

Result: 现有视频LLM在多视角一致性方面表现较差，比单视角性能差很多；简单微调会改善一致性但往往不如单视角训练；View-GRPO方法在提升跨视角一致性方面优于简单SFT和GRPO。

Conclusion: 视频LLM在多视角时间理解中存在一致性挑战，View-GRPO框架能有效提升跨视角一致性，为多视角视频理解提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Can Video-LLMs achieve consistent temporal understanding when videos capture
the same event from different viewpoints? To study this, we introduce
EgoExo-Con (Consistency), a benchmark of comprehensively synchronized
egocentric and exocentric video pairs with human-refined queries in natural
language. EgoExo-Con emphasizes two temporal understanding tasks: Temporal
Verification and Temporal Grounding. It evaluates not only correctness but
consistency across viewpoints. Our analysis reveals two critical limitations of
existing Video-LLMs: (1) models often fail to maintain consistency, with
results far worse than their single-view performances. (2) When naively
finetuned with synchronized videos of both viewpoints, the models show improved
consistency but often underperform those trained on a single view. For
improvements, we propose View-GRPO, a novel reinforcement learning framework
that effectively strengthens view-specific temporal reasoning while encouraging
consistent comprehension across viewpoints. Our method demonstrates its
superiority over naive SFT and GRPO, especially for improving cross-view
consistency. All resources will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: OracleAgent是首个用于甲骨文结构化管理和检索的智能体系统，整合了多模态知识库和LLM能力，显著提升甲骨文研究效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 甲骨文研究面临两大挑战：复杂的解读工作流程和低效的信息组织检索，学者需要花费大量时间搜索和管理相关资料。

Method: 构建包含140万单字拓片图像和8万解读文本的多模态知识库，开发基于LLM的智能体系统，灵活编排多个甲骨文分析工具。

Result: 在多模态推理和生成任务中表现优异，超越主流MLLM模型（如GPT-4o），能有效协助领域专家，显著降低研究时间成本。

Conclusion: OracleAgent为实现甲骨文辅助研究和自动化解读系统的实际部署迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: As one of the earliest writing systems, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) preserves
the cultural and intellectual heritage of ancient civilizations. However,
current OBS research faces two major challenges: (1) the interpretation of OBS
involves a complex workflow comprising multiple serial and parallel sub-tasks,
and (2) the efficiency of OBS information organization and retrieval remains a
critical bottleneck, as scholars often spend substantial effort searching for,
compiling, and managing relevant resources. To address these challenges, we
present OracleAgent, the first agent system designed for the structured
management and retrieval of OBS-related information. OracleAgent seamlessly
integrates multiple OBS analysis tools, empowered by large language models
(LLMs), and can flexibly orchestrate these components. Additionally, we
construct a comprehensive domain-specific multimodal knowledge base for OBS,
which is built through a rigorous multi-year process of data collection,
cleaning, and expert annotation. The knowledge base comprises over 1.4M
single-character rubbing images and 80K interpretation texts. OracleAgent
leverages this resource through its multimodal tools to assist experts in
retrieval tasks of character, document, interpretation text, and rubbing image.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OracleAgent achieves superior
performance across a range of multimodal reasoning and generation tasks,
surpassing leading mainstream multimodal large language models (MLLMs) (e.g.,
GPT-4o). Furthermore, our case study illustrates that OracleAgent can
effectively assist domain experts, significantly reducing the time cost of OBS
research. These results highlight OracleAgent as a significant step toward the
practical deployment of OBS-assisted research and automated interpretation
systems.

*Yuxuan Li,Tao Wang,Xianben Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合优化3D高斯点和相机姿态的统一框架，无需预校准输入，通过交替优化策略同时提升场景重建保真度和姿态精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统新视角合成方法依赖外部相机姿态估计工具如COLMAP，这会引入计算瓶颈和误差传播问题。

Method: 将联合优化解耦为两个交替阶段：固定姿态下通过可微分渲染更新3D高斯参数，然后使用结合几何和光度约束的自定义3D光流算法优化相机姿态。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛评估表明，该方法在重建质量上显著优于现有的无COLMAP技术，并且总体上超越了基于COLMAP的基准方法。

Conclusion: 该联合优化框架能够有效处理具有大视角变化和稀疏特征分布的挑战性场景，逐步减少投影误差。

Abstract: Traditional novel view synthesis methods heavily rely on external camera pose
estimation tools such as COLMAP, which often introduce computational
bottlenecks and propagate errors. To address these challenges, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes 3D Gaussian points and camera poses
without requiring pre-calibrated inputs. Our approach iteratively refines 3D
Gaussian parameters and updates camera poses through a novel co-optimization
strategy, ensuring simultaneous improvements in scene reconstruction fidelity
and pose accuracy. The key innovation lies in decoupling the joint optimization
into two interleaved phases: first, updating 3D Gaussian parameters via
differentiable rendering with fixed poses, and second, refining camera poses
using a customized 3D optical flow algorithm that incorporates geometric and
photometric constraints. This formulation progressively reduces projection
errors, particularly in challenging scenarios with large viewpoint variations
and sparse feature distributions, where traditional methods struggle. Extensive
evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly
outperforms existing COLMAP-free techniques in reconstruction quality, and also
surpasses the standard COLMAP-based baseline in general.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前端到端驾驶基准主要关注常规场景，无法充分测试系统在罕见长尾情况下的真实潜力，且现有评估指标难以有效评估多模态驾驶性能。

Method: 构建包含4,021个驾驶片段（约12小时）的WOD-E2E数据集，专门筛选发生频率低于0.03%的挑战性长尾场景。提出RFS评估指标，基于评分者标注的轨迹偏好标签来评估预测轨迹的质量。

Conclusion: 该工作旨在推动可泛化、鲁棒且安全的端到端自动驾驶代理的研究，使其能够处理复杂的现实世界情况。

Abstract: Vision-based end-to-end (E2E) driving has garnered significant interest in
the research community due to its scalability and synergy with multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily
feature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of
these systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall
short in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating
performance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the
Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021
driving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging
long-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring
frequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the
high-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8
surrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail
situations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback
Score (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between
predicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted
trajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have
released rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while
the held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge.
Through our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into
generalizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of
handling complex real-world situations.

TL;DR: 该论文提出将基于梯度的网络注意力信息与CNN特征表示相结合，用于改进RGB-D室内SLAM系统的帧关联性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然注意力模型在多个领域取得进展，但将梯度注意力信息直接集成到CNN表示中以增强语义对象理解的应用仍然有限。在SLAM等视觉任务中，CNN表示结合空间注意力对象位置可以提升性能。

Method: 利用任务特定的网络注意力，将基于网络梯度的层间注意力信息与CNN特征表示相集成，以改进帧关联。

Result: 实验结果表明，相比基线方法，该方法性能有所提升，特别是在大型环境中表现更优。

Conclusion: 将梯度注意力信息与CNN特征结合可以有效提升RGB-D室内SLAM系统的帧关联性能，特别是在复杂环境中。

Abstract: Attention models have recently emerged as a powerful approach, demonstrating
significant progress in various fields. Visualization techniques, such as class
activation mapping, provide visual insights into the reasoning of convolutional
neural networks (CNNs). Using network gradients, it is possible to identify
regions where the network pays attention during image recognition tasks.
Furthermore, these gradients can be combined with CNN features to localize more
generalizable, task-specific attentive (salient) regions within scenes.
However, explicit use of this gradient-based attention information integrated
directly into CNN representations for semantic object understanding remains
limited. Such integration is particularly beneficial for visual tasks like
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), where CNN representations
enriched with spatially attentive object locations can enhance performance. In
this work, we propose utilizing task-specific network attention for RGB-D
indoor SLAM. Specifically, we integrate layer-wise attention information
derived from network gradients with CNN feature representations to improve
frame association performance. Experimental results indicate improved
performance compared to baseline methods, particularly for large environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D部件生成方法存在两个主要问题：隐式向量集表示缺乏几何细节，而显式体素表示在共享全局网格时小部件分辨率不足导致质量下降。

Method: 首先通过隐式边界框向量集扩散过程确定边界框布局，然后在各自的全分辨率体素网格中生成详细部件。引入中心点编码策略解决不同尺寸部件间的对齐问题。

Result: FullPart在3D部件生成方面达到了最先进的性能，能够合成复杂的细节，同时保持全局一致性。

Conclusion: FullPart通过结合隐式和显式表示的优势，有效解决了3D部件生成中的细节保留和分辨率问题，为未来研究提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Part-based 3D generation holds great potential for various applications.
Previous part generators that represent parts using implicit vector-set tokens
often suffer from insufficient geometric details. Another line of work adopts
an explicit voxel representation but shares a global voxel grid among all
parts; this often causes small parts to occupy too few voxels, leading to
degraded quality. In this paper, we propose FullPart, a novel framework that
combines both implicit and explicit paradigms. It first derives the bounding
box layout through an implicit box vector-set diffusion process, a task that
implicit diffusion handles effectively since box tokens contain little
geometric detail. Then, it generates detailed parts, each within its own fixed
full-resolution voxel grid. Instead of sharing a global low-resolution space,
each part in our method - even small ones - is generated at full resolution,
enabling the synthesis of intricate details. We further introduce a
center-point encoding strategy to address the misalignment issue when
exchanging information between parts of different actual sizes, thereby
maintaining global coherence. Moreover, to tackle the scarcity of reliable part
data, we present PartVerse-XL, the largest human-annotated 3D part dataset to
date with 40K objects and 320K parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FullPart achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D part generation. We will
release all code, data, and model to benefit future research in 3D part
generation.

Abstract: Arbitrary-scale video super-resolution (AVSR) aims to enhance the resolution
of video frames, potentially at various scaling factors, which presents several
challenges regarding spatial detail reproduction, temporal consistency, and
computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a strong baseline BasicAVSR
for AVSR by integrating four key components: 1) adaptive multi-scale frequency
priors generated from image Laplacian pyramids, 2) a flow-guided propagation
unit to aggregate spatiotemporal information from adjacent frames, 3) a
second-order motion compensation unit for more accurate spatial alignment of
adjacent frames, and 4) a hyper-upsampling unit to generate scale-aware and
content-independent upsampling kernels. To meet diverse application demands, we
instantiate three propagation variants: (i) a unidirectional RNN unit for
strictly online inference, (ii) a unidirectional RNN unit empowered with a
limited lookahead that tolerates a small output delay, and (iii) a
bidirectional RNN unit designed for offline tasks where computational resources
are less constrained. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and
adaptability of our model across these different scenarios. Through extensive
experiments, we show that BasicAVSR significantly outperforms existing methods
in terms of super-resolution quality, generalization ability, and inference
speed. Our work not only advances the state-of-the-art in AVSR but also extends
its core components to multiple frameworks for diverse scenarios. The code is

Abstract: Large annotated datasets are essential for training robust Computer-Aided
Diagnosis (CAD) models for breast cancer detection or risk prediction. However,
acquiring such datasets with fine-detailed annotation is both costly and
time-consuming. Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, which are
pre-trained on large image-text pairs, offer a promising solution by enhancing
robustness and data efficiency in medical imaging tasks. This paper introduces
a novel Multi-View Mammography and Language Model for breast cancer
classification and risk prediction, trained on a dataset of paired mammogram
images and synthetic radiology reports. Our MV-MLM leverages multi-view
supervision to learn rich representations from extensive radiology data by
employing cross-modal self-supervision across image-text pairs. This includes
multiple views and the corresponding pseudo-radiology reports. We propose a
novel joint visual-textual learning strategy to enhance generalization and
accuracy performance over different data types and tasks to distinguish breast
tissues or cancer characteristics(calcification, mass) and utilize these
patterns to understand mammography images and predict cancer risk. We evaluated
our method on both private and publicly available datasets, demonstrating that
the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in three
classification tasks: (1) malignancy classification, (2) subtype
classification, and (3) image-based cancer risk prediction. Furthermore, the
model exhibits strong data efficiency, outperforming existing fully supervised
or VLM baselines while trained on synthetic text reports and without the need
for actual radiology reports.

Abstract: Modes of transportation vary across countries depending on geographical
location and cultural context. In South Asian countries rickshaws are among the
most common means of local transport. Based on their mode of operation,
rickshaws in cities across Bangladesh can be broadly classified into non-auto
(pedal-powered) and auto-rickshaws (motorized). Monitoring the movement of
auto-rickshaws is necessary as traffic rules often restrict auto-rickshaws from
accessing certain routes. However, existing surveillance systems make it quite
difficult to monitor them due to their similarity to other vehicles, especially
non-auto rickshaws whereas manual video analysis is too time-consuming. This
paper presents a machine learning-based approach to automatically detect
auto-rickshaws in traffic images. In this system, we used real-time object
detection using the YOLOv8 model. For training purposes, we prepared a set of
1,730 annotated images that were captured under various traffic conditions. The
results show that our proposed model performs well in real-time auto-rickshaw
detection and offers an mAP50 of 83.447% and binary precision and recall values
above 78%, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling both dense and sparse
traffic scenarios. The dataset has been publicly released for further research.

Motivation: 当前缺乏针对可穿戴设备场景的多模态检索增强生成(MM-RAG)的全面基准测试，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 构建包含多样化图像质量问题、六种问题类型、不同实体流行度、信息动态性和对话轮次的综合数据集，设计三个任务：单源增强、多源增强和多轮对话。

Result: 简单RAG方法在CRAG-MM单轮和多轮QA上的真实性分别仅为32%和43%，最先进的工业解决方案质量相似(32%/45%)，表明有较大改进空间。

Abstract: Wearable devices such as smart glasses are transforming the way people
interact with their surroundings, enabling users to seek information regarding
entities in their view. Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG)
plays a key role in supporting such questions, yet there is still no
comprehensive benchmark for this task, especially regarding wearables
scenarios. To fill this gap, we present CRAG-MM -- a Comprehensive RAG
benchmark for Multi-modal Multi-turn conversations. CRAG-MM contains a diverse
set of 6.5K (image, question, answer) triplets and 2K visual-based multi-turn
conversations across 13 domains, including 6.2K egocentric images designed to
mimic captures from wearable devices. We carefully constructed the questions to
reflect real-world scenarios and challenges, including five types of
image-quality issues, six question types, varying entity popularity, differing
information dynamism, and different conversation turns. We design three tasks:
single-source augmentation, multi-source augmentation, and multi-turn
conversations -- each paired with an associated retrieval corpus and APIs for
both image-KG retrieval and webpage retrieval. Our evaluation shows that
straightforward RAG approaches achieve only 32% and 43% truthfulness on CRAG-MM
single- and multi-turn QA, respectively, whereas state-of-the-art industry
solutions have similar quality (32%/45%), underscoring ample room for
improvement. The benchmark has hosted KDD Cup 2025, attracting about 1K
participants and 5K submissions, with winning solutions improving baseline
performance by 28%, highlighting its early impact on advancing the field.

Motivation: 现有从单张模糊图像提取运动信息的方法（如模糊核和光流）通常质量较低，表现为粗粒度和不准确，需要高质量的运动轨迹估计。

Method: MoTDiff包含两个关键组件：1）使用从单张模糊图像提取的多尺度特征图作为条件的条件扩散框架；2）促进精确识别细粒度运动轨迹、一致估计运动路径整体形状和位置、以及沿运动轨迹像素连通性的新训练方法。

Result: 实验表明MoTDiff在盲图像去模糊和编码曝光摄影应用中优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 提出的MoTDiff框架能够从单张运动模糊图像估计高质量的高分辨率运动轨迹，在多个应用中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of motion information is crucial in diverse computational
imaging and computer vision applications. Researchers have investigated various
methods to extract motion information from a single blurred image, including
blur kernels and optical flow. However, existing motion representations are
often of low quality, i.e., coarse-grained and inaccurate. In this paper, we
propose the first high-resolution (HR) Motion Trajectory estimation framework
using Diffusion models (MoTDiff). Different from existing motion
representations, we aim to estimate an HR motion trajectory with high-quality
from a single motion-blurred image. The proposed MoTDiff consists of two key
components: 1) a new conditional diffusion framework that uses multi-scale
feature maps extracted from a single blurred image as a condition, and 2) a new
training method that can promote precise identification of a fine-grained
motion trajectory, consistent estimation of overall shape and position of a
motion path, and pixel connectivity along a motion trajectory. Our experiments
demonstrate that the proposed MoTDiff can outperform state-of-the-art methods
in both blind image deblurring and coded exposure photography applications.

Result: ConceptScope能捕捉广泛的视觉概念，检测已知偏见并发现未标注的偏见，概念激活产生与语义相关图像区域对齐的空间归因。

Conclusion: ConceptScope为数据集审计和模型诊断提供了一个实用工具，能够可靠地识别数据集偏见。

Abstract: Dataset bias, where data points are skewed to certain concepts, is ubiquitous
in machine learning datasets. Yet, systematically identifying these biases is
challenging without costly, fine-grained attribute annotations. We present
ConceptScope, a scalable and automated framework for analyzing visual datasets
by discovering and quantifying human-interpretable concepts using Sparse
Autoencoders trained on representations from vision foundation models.
ConceptScope categorizes concepts into target, context, and bias types based on
their semantic relevance and statistical correlation to class labels, enabling
class-level dataset characterization, bias identification, and robustness
evaluation through concept-based subgrouping. We validate that ConceptScope
captures a wide range of visual concepts, including objects, textures,
backgrounds, facial attributes, emotions, and actions, through comparisons with
annotated datasets. Furthermore, we show that concept activations produce
spatial attributions that align with semantically meaningful image regions.
ConceptScope reliably detects known biases (e.g., background bias in
Waterbirds) and uncovers previously unannotated ones (e.g, co-occurring objects
in ImageNet), offering a practical tool for dataset auditing and model
diagnostics.

Motivation: 解决传统素描到3D姿态估计方法因缺乏大规模素描-3D姿态标注数据而依赖耗时优化和启发式规则的问题，提高估计准确性和泛化能力。

Method: 使用扩散模型从2D姿态合成素描图像创建SKEP-120K数据集，结合现有2D姿态检测器和生成扩散先验进行素描特征提取，采用前馈神经网络进行2D姿态估计，并加入多种启发式损失函数保证几何一致性。

Conclusion: 提出的"从合成中学习"策略和端到端框架有效解决了素描到3D姿态估计的挑战，在准确性和效率方面取得显著提升。

Abstract: 3D human pose estimation from sketches has broad applications in computer
animation and film production. Unlike traditional human pose estimation, this
task presents unique challenges due to the abstract and disproportionate nature
of sketches. Previous sketch-to-pose methods, constrained by the lack of
large-scale sketch-3D pose annotations, primarily relied on optimization with
heuristic rules-an approach that is both time-consuming and limited in
generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach
leveraging a "learn from synthesis" strategy. First, a diffusion model is
trained to synthesize sketch images from 2D poses projected from 3D human
poses, mimicking disproportionate human structures in sketches. This process
enables the creation of a synthetic dataset, SKEP-120K, consisting of 120k
accurate sketch-3D pose annotation pairs across various sketch styles. Building
on this synthetic dataset, we introduce an end-to-end data-driven framework for
estimating human poses and shapes from diverse sketch styles. Our framework
combines existing 2D pose detectors and generative diffusion priors for sketch
feature extraction with a feed-forward neural network for efficient 2D pose
estimation. Multiple heuristic loss functions are incorporated to guarantee
geometric coherence between the derived 3D poses and the detected 2D poses
while preserving accurate self-contacts. Qualitative, quantitative, and
subjective evaluations collectively show that our model substantially surpasses
previous ones in both estimation accuracy and speed for sketch-to-pose tasks.

Abstract: The sustainability of supply chain plays a key role in achieving optimal
performance in controlling the supply chain. The management of risks that occur
in a supply chain is a fundamental problem for the purpose of developing the
sustainability of the network and elevating the performance efficiency of the
supply chain. The correct classification of products is another essential
element in a sustainable supply chain. Acknowledging recent breakthroughs in
the context of deep networks, several architectural options have been deployed
to analyze supply chain datasets. A novel geometric deep network is used to
propose an ensemble deep network. The proposed Chebyshev ensemble geometric
network (Ch-EGN) is a hybrid convolutional and geometric deep learning. This
network is proposed to leverage the information dependencies in supply chain to
derive invisible states of samples in the database. The functionality of the
proposed deep network is assessed on the two different databases. The
SupplyGraph Dataset and DataCo are considered in this research. The prediction
of delivery status of DataCo supply chain is done for risk administration. The
product classification and edge classification are performed using the
SupplyGraph database to enhance the sustainability of the supply network. An
average accuracy of 98.95% is obtained for the ensemble network for risk
management. The average accuracy of 100% and 98.07% are obtained for
sustainable supply chain in terms of 5 product group classification and 4
product relation classification, respectively. The average accuracy of 92.37%
is attained for 25 company relation classification. The results confirm an
average improvement and efficiency of the proposed method compared to the
state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: 本文提出了OmniLayout-1M数据集和OmniLayout-LLM模型，解决了文档布局生成领域数据稀缺和复杂布局处理困难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文档AI研究主要集中在文档布局分析，而文档布局生成研究不足。现有数据集主要包含学术论文的曼哈顿式结构，缺乏报纸、杂志等开放世界文档类型的多样性布局。

Method: 构建了首个百万规模的多样化文档布局数据集OmniLayout-1M，包含六种常见文档类型。提出了OmniLayout-LLM模型，采用两阶段粗到细学习范式：首先从OmniLayout-1M学习通用布局原则，然后通过细粒度标注将知识迁移到特定领域。

Result: 在M$^{6}$Doc数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在多个领域都取得了强劲性能，显著超越了现有的布局生成专家和几个最新的通用大语言模型。

Conclusion: OmniLayout-1M数据集和OmniLayout-LLM模型为文档布局生成领域提供了有效的解决方案，填补了多样化布局数据稀缺的空白，并在复杂布局生成任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Document AI has advanced rapidly and is attracting increasing attention. Yet,
while most efforts have focused on document layout analysis (DLA), its
generative counterpart, document layout generation, remains underexplored. A
major obstacle lies in the scarcity of diverse layouts: academic papers with
Manhattan-style structures dominate existing studies, while open-world genres
such as newspapers and magazines remain severely underrepresented. To address
this gap, we curate OmniLayout-1M, the first million-scale dataset of diverse
document layouts, covering six common document types and comprising
contemporary layouts collected from multiple sources. Moreover, since existing
methods struggle in complex domains and often fail to arrange long sequences
coherently, we introduce OmniLayout-LLM, a 0.5B model with designed two-stage
Coarse-to-Fine learning paradigm: 1) learning universal layout principles from
OmniLayout-1M with coarse category definitions, and 2) transferring the
knowledge to a specific domain with fine-grained annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on
multiple domains in M$^{6}$Doc dataset, substantially surpassing both existing
layout generation experts and several latest general-purpose LLMs. Our code,
models, and dataset will be publicly released.

Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型在多模态任务上表现出色，但对视频中时间信息的理解能力较弱且缺乏充分评估。作者希望通过判断时间箭头这一简单但具有揭示性的任务来探究这一差距。

Method: 引入AoT-PsyPhyBENCH基准，使用与人类行为研究相同的刺激物和基线，全面评估开放权重和专有、推理和非推理的视觉语言模型在判断视频时间方向上的表现。

Result: 大多数模型表现接近随机水平，即使在物理不可逆过程（如自由落体、扩散/爆炸）和因果手动动作（除法/加法）等人类几乎能立即识别的任务上，最佳模型也远远落后于人类准确率。

Conclusion: 当前多模态系统存在根本性差距：虽然它们能捕捉丰富的视觉语义相关性，但缺乏时间连续性和因果理解所需的归纳偏差。作者发布代码和数据以促进视觉语言模型在物理和时间推理能力方面的进一步发展。

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet
their grasp of temporal information in video remains weak and, crucially,
under-evaluated. We probe this gap with a deceptively simple but revealing
challenge: judging the arrow of time (AoT)-whether a short clip is played
forward or backward. We introduce AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, a psychophysically validated
benchmark that tests whether VLMs can infer temporal direction in natural
videos using the same stimuli and behavioral baselines established for humans.
Our comprehensive evaluation of open-weight and proprietary, reasoning and
non-reasoning VLMs reveals that most models perform near chance, and even the
best lag far behind human accuracy on physically irreversible processes (e.g.,
free fall, diffusion/explosion) and causal manual actions (division/addition)
that humans recognize almost instantly. These results highlight a fundamental
gap in current multimodal systems: while they capture rich visual-semantic
correlations, they lack the inductive biases required for temporal continuity
and causal understanding. We release the code and data for AoT-PsyPhyBENCH to
encourage further progress in the physical and temporal reasoning capabilities
of VLMs.

Motivation: 现有融合方法在模态信息平衡方面存在困境，生成式融合方法的生成能力有限且缺乏可解释性，影响复杂场景下的可靠性和一致性

Result: 在多个数据集上实现最先进的融合性能，显著提升语义分割指标，增强结构一致性和细节质量

Conclusion: 基于人类认知启发的生成式图像融合方法在提升结构一致性和细节质量方面具有显著优势

Abstract: Existing infrared and visible image fusion methods often face the dilemma of
balancing modal information. Generative fusion methods reconstruct fused images
by learning from data distributions, but their generative capabilities remain
limited. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in modal information selection
further affects the reliability and consistency of fusion results in complex
scenarios. This manuscript revisits the essence of generative image fusion
under the inspiration of human cognitive laws and proposes a novel infrared and
visible image fusion method, termed HCLFuse. First, HCLFuse investigates the
quantification theory of information mapping in unsupervised fusion networks,
which leads to the design of a multi-scale mask-regulated variational
bottleneck encoder. This encoder applies posterior probability modeling and
information decomposition to extract accurate and concise low-level modal
information, thereby supporting the generation of high-fidelity structural
details. Furthermore, the probabilistic generative capability of the diffusion
model is integrated with physical laws, forming a time-varying physical
guidance mechanism that adaptively regulates the generation process at
different stages, thereby enhancing the ability of the model to perceive the
intrinsic structure of data and reducing dependence on data quality.
Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
fusion performance in qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple
datasets and significantly improves semantic segmentation metrics. This fully
demonstrates the advantages of this generative image fusion method, drawing
inspiration from human cognition, in enhancing structural consistency and
detail quality.

Motivation: 探索不同复杂度的CNN架构在远距离虹膜验证任务中的互补性，以提升识别性能。

Method: 在VGGFace2的眼部图像上训练三种CNN架构，使用余弦和chi2距离度量，通过逻辑回归进行分数级融合，并利用LIME热图和Jensen-Shannon散度分析注意力模式。

Result: ResNet50单独表现最佳，但三种网络融合带来显著提升，热图显示不同网络关注图像的不同区域，这解释了它们的互补性。

Conclusion: 多网络融合策略显著优于现有方法，在UBIPr数据库上实现了新的最先进性能，证明了不同CNN架构在虹膜验证中的互补价值。

Abstract: We study the complementarity of different CNNs for periocular verification at
different distances on the UBIPr database. We train three architectures of
increasing complexity (SqueezeNet, MobileNetv2, and ResNet50) on a large set of
eye crops from VGGFace2. We analyse performance with cosine and chi2 metrics,
compare different network initialisations, and apply score-level fusion via
logistic regression. In addition, we use LIME heatmaps and Jensen-Shannon
divergence to compare attention patterns of the CNNs. While ResNet50
consistently performs best individually, the fusion provides substantial gains,
especially when combining all three networks. Heatmaps show that networks
usually focus on distinct regions of a given image, which explains their
complementarity. Our method significantly outperforms previous works on UBIPr,
achieving a new state-of-the-art.

Motivation: 现有模仿学习方法存在模式崩溃问题，无法生成多样化轨迹假设；而现有生成方法难以在生成过程中直接融入安全约束和物理规则，需要额外优化阶段。

Method: 采用约束流匹配方法，显式建模流匹配过程，在流匹配过程中直接施加显式约束，确保生成轨迹符合安全性和运动学规则，并将驾驶攻击性参数化为控制信号。

Result: 在NavSim v2挑战赛中获得第二名，EPDMS得分为51.31，并获得创新奖。

Conclusion: CATG框架有效解决了自动驾驶规划中的模式崩溃问题，能够生成多样化且符合约束的轨迹，实现了更好的规划性能。

Abstract: Planning is a critical component of end-to-end autonomous driving. However,
prevailing imitation learning methods often suffer from mode collapse, failing
to produce diverse trajectory hypotheses. Meanwhile, existing generative
approaches struggle to incorporate crucial safety and physical constraints
directly into the generative process, necessitating an additional optimization
stage to refine their outputs. To address these limitations, we propose CATG, a
novel planning framework that leverages Constrained Flow Matching. Concretely,
CATG explicitly models the flow matching process, which inherently mitigates
mode collapse and allows for flexible guidance from various conditioning
signals. Our primary contribution is the novel imposition of explicit
constraints directly within the flow matching process, ensuring that the
generated trajectories adhere to vital safety and kinematic rules. Secondly,
CATG parameterizes driving aggressiveness as a control signal during
generation, enabling precise manipulation of trajectory style. Notably, on the
NavSim v2 challenge, CATG achieved 2nd place with an EPDMS score of 51.31 and
was honored with the Innovation Award.

Motivation: 研究眼周生物识别技术，该区域具有高区分度和最小采集约束，旨在评估不同CNN架构在这种生物识别任务中的有效性。

Method: 使用三种不同深度和复杂度的卷积神经网络架构，在从VGGFace2数据库中提取的1,907,572个眼部裁剪图像上进行训练，并在VGGFace2-Pose和UFPR-Periocular两个数据集上进行实验评估。

Result: 在不受控制的VGGFace2条件下，眼部裁剪图像的等错误率为9-15%，而全脸图像的等错误率为3-6%。在UFPR-Periocular数据集上获得了显著更好的性能，等错误率为1-2%，这得益于更高的图像质量和更一致的采集协议。

Conclusion: 眼周生物识别在受控条件下表现优异，在UFPR-Periocular数据集上取得了目前报告的最低等错误率，证明了该方法在高质量图像和一致采集协议下的有效性。

Abstract: We focus on ocular biometrics, specifically the periocular region (the area
around the eye), which offers high discrimination and minimal acquisition
constraints. We evaluate three Convolutional Neural Network architectures of
varying depth and complexity to assess their effectiveness for periocular
recognition. The networks are trained on 1,907,572 ocular crops extracted from
the large-scale VGGFace2 database. This significantly contrasts with existing
works, which typically rely on small-scale periocular datasets for training
having only a few thousand images. Experiments are conducted with ocular images
from VGGFace2-Pose, a subset of VGGFace2 containing in-the-wild face images,
and the UFPR-Periocular database, which consists of selfies captured via mobile
devices with user guidance on the screen. Due to the uncontrolled conditions of
VGGFace2, the Equal Error Rates (EERs) obtained with ocular crops range from
9-15%, noticeably higher than the 3-6% EERs achieved using full-face images. In
contrast, UFPR-Periocular yields significantly better performance (EERs of
1-2%), thanks to higher image quality and more consistent acquisition
protocols. To the best of our knowledge, these are the lowest reported EERs on
the UFPR dataset to date.

Abstract: Agile Earth Observation Satellites (AEOSs) constellations offer unprecedented
flexibility for monitoring the Earth's surface, but their scheduling remains
challenging under large-scale scenarios, dynamic environments, and stringent
constraints. Existing methods often simplify these complexities, limiting their
real-world performance. We address this gap with a unified framework
integrating a standardized benchmark suite and a novel scheduling model. Our
benchmark suite, AEOS-Bench, contains $3,907$ finely tuned satellite assets and
$16,410$ scenarios. Each scenario features $1$ to $50$ satellites and $50$ to
$300$ imaging tasks. These scenarios are generated via a high-fidelity
simulation platform, ensuring realistic satellite behavior such as orbital
dynamics and resource constraints. Ground truth scheduling annotations are
provided for each scenario. To our knowledge, AEOS-Bench is the first
large-scale benchmark suite tailored for realistic constellation scheduling.
Building upon this benchmark, we introduce AEOS-Former, a Transformer-based
scheduling model that incorporates a constraint-aware attention mechanism. A
dedicated internal constraint module explicitly models the physical and
operational limits of each satellite. Through simulation-based iterative
learning, AEOS-Former adapts to diverse scenarios, offering a robust solution
for AEOS constellation scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate that
AEOS-Former outperforms baseline models in task completion and energy
efficiency, with ablation studies highlighting the contribution of each
component. Code and data are provided in

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss among middle-aged
and elderly people, which significantly impacts their daily lives and mental
health. To improve the efficiency of clinical screening and enable the early
detection of DR, a variety of automated DR diagnosis systems have been recently
established based on convolutional neural network (CNN) or vision Transformer
(ViT). However, due to the own shortages of CNN / ViT, the performance of
existing methods using single-type backbone has reached a bottleneck. One
potential way for the further improvements is integrating different kinds of
backbones, which can fully leverage the respective strengths of them
(\emph{i.e.,} the local feature extraction capability of CNN and the global
feature capturing ability of ViT). To this end, we propose a novel paradigm to
effectively fuse the features extracted by different backbones based on the
theory of evidence. Specifically, the proposed evidential fusion paradigm
transforms the features from different backbones into supporting evidences via
a set of deep evidential networks. With the supporting evidences, the
aggregated opinion can be accordingly formed, which can be used to adaptively
tune the fusion pattern between different backbones and accordingly boost the
performance of our hybrid model. We evaluated our method on two publicly
available DR grading datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our
hybrid model not only improves the accuracy of DR grading, compared to the
state-of-the-art frameworks, but also provides the excellent interpretability
for feature fusion and decision-making.

TL;DR: GLYPH-SR是一个视觉语言引导的扩散框架，专门针对场景文本超分辨率，通过结合OCR指导和场景感知调度器，同时优化文本可读性和视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超分辨率方法主要关注失真指标，对字符级错误不敏感，而场景文本（如标志、标签）包含最关键信息，需要专门优化文本可读性。

Method: 使用文本-超分辨率融合控制网络（TS-ControlNet）和乒乓调度器，交替应用文本和场景中心指导，在合成语料上训练组件。

Result: 在SVT、SCUT-CTW1500和CUTE80数据集上，x4和x8倍率下，OCR F1分数比基线提升高达15.18个百分点，同时保持竞争性的感知质量指标。

Conclusion: GLYPH-SR能够同时实现高可读性和高视觉真实感，提供既美观又易读的超分辨率结果。

Abstract: Image super-resolution(SR) is fundamental to many vision system-from
surveillance and autonomy to document analysis and retail analytics-because
recovering high-frequency details, especially scene-text, enables reliable
downstream perception. Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such
as signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable
information; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character
recognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image
appears sharp. Yet previous SR research has often been tuned to distortion
(PSNR/SSIM) or learned perceptual metrics (LIPIS, MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ) that
are largely insensitive to character-level errors. Furthermore, studies that do
address text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters,
overlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result,
scene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in
practical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for
both text legibility and perceptual quality. We present GLYPH-SR, a
vision-language-guided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives
jointly. GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet(TS-ControlNet) guided by
OCR data, and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and
scene-centric guidance. To enable targeted text restoration, we train these
components on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen.
Across SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4, and x8, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by
up to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baseline (SVT x8, OpenOCR)
while maintaining competitive MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ. GLYPH-SR is designed
to satisfy both objectives simultaneously-high readability and high visual
realism-delivering SR that looks right and reds right.

Conclusion: 注意力先验能够解决EEG信号的模糊性，实现高保真度重建，在医学诊断和神经自适应界面中有应用前景。

Abstract: Existing EEG-driven image reconstruction methods often overlook spatial
attention mechanisms, limiting fidelity and semantic coherence. To address
this, we propose a dual-conditioning framework that combines EEG embeddings
with spatial saliency maps to enhance image generation. Our approach leverages
the Adaptive Thinking Mapper (ATM) for EEG feature extraction and fine-tunes
Stable Diffusion 2.1 via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to align neural signals
with visual semantics, while a ControlNet branch conditions generation on
saliency maps for spatial control. Evaluated on THINGS-EEG, our method achieves
a significant improvement in the quality of low- and high-level image features
over existing approaches. Simultaneously, strongly aligning with human visual
attention. The results demonstrate that attentional priors resolve EEG
ambiguities, enabling high-fidelity reconstructions with applications in
medical diagnostics and neuroadaptive interfaces, advancing neural decoding
through efficient adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models.

*Xiangqing Zheng,Chengyue Wu,Kehai Chen,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了LoCoT2V-Bench基准，专门用于评估复杂输入条件下的长视频生成，包含现实复杂提示和多维评估框架，发现现有方法在事件间一致性、细粒度对齐和高级主题遵循方面存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成评估基准主要依赖简化提示和低层次指标，忽视了与提示的细粒度对齐以及叙事连贯性、主题表达等抽象维度，难以有效评估长视频生成质量。

Method: 基于真实世界视频构建包含场景转换和事件动态等元素的现实复杂提示，建立多维评估框架，包括事件级对齐、细粒度时间一致性、内容清晰度和人类期望实现度等新指标。

Result: 对9个代表性长视频生成模型的评估显示，现有方法在基本视觉和时间方面表现良好，但在事件间一致性、细粒度对齐和高级主题遵循等方面存在显著困难。

Conclusion: LoCoT2V-Bench为长格式复杂文本到视频生成提供了全面可靠的评估平台，并指明了未来方法改进的关键方向。

Abstract: Recently text-to-video generation has made impressive progress in producing
short, high-quality clips, but evaluating long-form outputs remains a major
challenge especially when processing complex prompts. Existing benchmarks
mostly rely on simplified prompts and focus on low-level metrics, overlooking
fine-grained alignment with prompts and abstract dimensions such as narrative
coherence and thematic expression. To address these gaps, we propose
LoCoT2V-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed for long video generation
(LVG) under complex input conditions. Based on various real-world videos,
LoCoT2V-Bench introduces a suite of realistic and complex prompts incorporating
elements like scene transitions and event dynamics. Moreover, it constructs a
multi-dimensional evaluation framework that includes our newly proposed metrics
such as event-level alignment, fine-grained temporal consistency, content
clarity, and the Human Expectation Realization Degree (HERD) that focuses on
more abstract attributes like narrative flow, emotional response, and character
development. Using this framework, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
nine representative LVG models, finding that while current methods perform well
on basic visual and temporal aspects, they struggle with inter-event
consistency, fine-grained alignment, and high-level thematic adherence, etc.
Overall, LoCoT2V-Bench provides a comprehensive and reliable platform for
evaluating long-form complex text-to-video generation and highlights critical
directions for future method improvement.

*Shihab Aaqil Ahamed,Udaya S. K. P. Miriya Thanthrige,Ranga Rodrigo,Muhammad Haris Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了A-TPT框架，通过引入角度多样性来提升视觉语言模型在测试时提示调优中的校准性能，通过最大化归一化文本特征之间的最小成对角度距离来实现特征分布的均匀性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时提示调优方法缺乏文本特征之间的分散性，导致校准性能不佳，影响视觉语言模型的可靠性、可信度和安全性。这些方法主要关注最大化平均文本特征分散度或施加正交约束，但忽视了角度多样性的关键作用。

Method: 提出A-TPT框架，通过最大化归一化文本特征在单位超球面上的最小成对角度距离，鼓励学习提示诱导的文本特征分布的均匀性，从而实现角度多样性。

Result: 在多个骨干网络和数据集上的广泛实验表明，A-TPT在减少聚合平均校准误差方面持续优于最先进的TPT方法，同时保持相当的准确率。在自然分布偏移上表现出优越的零样本校准性能，并能很好地泛化到医学数据集。

Conclusion: 促进角度多样性是实现良好分散文本特征的有效方法，能显著改善视觉语言模型在测试时适应过程中的校准性能。

Abstract: Test-time prompt tuning (TPT) has emerged as a promising technique for
adapting large vision-language models (VLMs) to unseen tasks without relying on
labeled data. However, the lack of dispersion between textual features can hurt
calibration performance, which raises concerns about VLMs' reliability,
trustworthiness, and safety. Current TPT approaches primarily focus on
improving prompt calibration by either maximizing average textual feature
dispersion or enforcing orthogonality constraints to encourage angular
separation. However, these methods may not always have optimal angular
separation between class-wise textual features, which implies overlooking the
critical role of angular diversity. To address this, we propose A-TPT, a novel
TPT framework that introduces angular diversity to encourage uniformity in the
distribution of normalized textual features induced by corresponding learnable
prompts. This uniformity is achieved by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular
distance between features on the unit hypersphere. We show that our approach
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art TPT methods in reducing the aggregate
average calibration error while maintaining comparable accuracy through
extensive experiments with various backbones on different datasets. Notably,
our approach exhibits superior zero-shot calibration performance on natural
distribution shifts and generalizes well to medical datasets. We provide
extensive analyses, including theoretical aspects, to establish the grounding
of A-TPT. These results highlight the potency of promoting angular diversity to
achieve well-dispersed textual features, significantly improving VLM
calibration during test-time adaptation. Our code will be made publicly
available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用基础3D重建模型在静态场景中的2D和3D对应关系能力，将其扩展到动态点跟踪任务，解决现有方法在动态对应关系上的局限性。

Method: 结合重建损失与动态对应关系训练，添加可见性头，使用少量合成数据对MASt3R进行微调，仅使用包含查询点的帧对进行训练和评估。

Result: 在四个数据集上取得竞争性或更优的结果：TAP-Vid-DAVIS上73.8 δ_avg/85.8%遮挡准确率，EgoPoints上61.3 vs 54.2，RGB-S上87.0 vs 82.8，显著超越CoTracker3。

Conclusion: 通过3D基础对应关系的方法能够有效实现点跟踪，在静态和动态点跟踪任务中都表现出色，证明了基础3D重建模型在点跟踪任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in foundational 3D reconstruction models, such as DUSt3R and
MASt3R, have shown great potential in 2D and 3D correspondence in static
scenes. In this paper, we propose to adapt them for the task of point tracking
through 3D grounded correspondence. We first demonstrate that these models are
competitive point trackers when focusing on static points, present in current
point tracking benchmarks ($+33.5\%$ on EgoPoints vs. CoTracker2). We propose
to combine the reconstruction loss with training for dynamic correspondence
along with a visibility head, and fine-tuning MASt3R for point tracking using a
relatively small amount of synthetic data. Importantly, we only train and
evaluate on pairs of frames where one contains the query point, effectively
removing any temporal context. Using a mix of dynamic and static point
correspondences, we achieve competitive or superior point tracking results on
four datasets (e.g. competitive on TAP-Vid-DAVIS 73.8 $\delta_{avg}$ / 85.8\%
occlusion acc. for PointSt3R compared to 75.7 / 88.3\% for CoTracker2; and
significantly outperform CoTracker3 on EgoPoints 61.3 vs 54.2 and RGB-S 87.0 vs
82.8). We also present results on 3D point tracking along with several
ablations on training datasets and percentage of dynamic correspondences.

*Yuanting Fan,Jun Liu,Xiaochen Chen,Bin-Bin Gao,Jian Li,Yong Liu,Jinlong Peng,Chengjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为FineGrainedAD的新框架，通过多级细粒度语义描述来改进小样本异常检测中的异常定位性能，解决了现有方法因缺乏详细文本描述而导致的语义不对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有小样本异常检测方法依赖预训练视觉语言模型的特征相似性，但由于缺乏详细文本描述，只能使用预定义的图像级描述来匹配视觉补丁，导致图像描述与补丁级视觉异常之间的语义不对齐，定位性能不理想。

Method: 提出多级细粒度语义描述(MFSC)为异常检测数据集提供多级细粒度文本描述，并构建FineGrainedAD框架，包含多级可学习提示(MLLP)和多级语义对齐(MLSA)两个组件。MLLP通过自动替换和连接机制将细粒度语义引入多级可学习提示，MLSA设计区域聚合策略和多级对齐训练来促进可学习提示与对应视觉区域的对齐。

Result: 实验表明，FineGrainedAD在MVTec-AD和VisA数据集的小样本设置下实现了优异的整体性能。

Conclusion: 通过引入多级细粒度语义描述和对齐机制，FineGrainedAD有效解决了小样本异常检测中的语义不对齐问题，显著提升了异常定位性能。

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) methods identify anomalous regions with few
known normal samples. Most existing methods rely on the generalization ability
of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to recognize potentially anomalous
regions through feature similarity between text descriptions and images.
However, due to the lack of detailed textual descriptions, these methods can
only pre-define image-level descriptions to match each visual patch token to
identify potential anomalous regions, which leads to the semantic misalignment
between image descriptions and patch-level visual anomalies, achieving
sub-optimal localization performance. To address the above issues, we propose
the Multi-Level Fine-Grained Semantic Caption (MFSC) to provide multi-level and
fine-grained textual descriptions for existing anomaly detection datasets with
automatic construction pipeline. Based on the MFSC, we propose a novel
framework named FineGrainedAD to improve anomaly localization performance,
which consists of two components: Multi-Level Learnable Prompt (MLLP) and
Multi-Level Semantic Alignment (MLSA). MLLP introduces fine-grained semantics
into multi-level learnable prompts through automatic replacement and
concatenation mechanism, while MLSA designs region aggregation strategy and
multi-level alignment training to facilitate learnable prompts better align
with corresponding visual regions. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
FineGrainedAD achieves superior overall performance in few-shot settings on
MVTec-AD and VisA datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型中对象-上下文捷径的挑战，当测试场景与训练共现模式不同时，这种捷径会削弱零样本可靠性

Method: 将问题重构为因果推理问题，在CLIP表示空间中估计对象和背景期望，通过重新组合对象特征与来自外部数据集、批次邻居或文本描述的不同上下文来合成反事实嵌入

Result: 无需重新训练或提示设计，在上下文敏感基准测试中显著提高了最差组和平均准确率，建立了新的零样本最先进水平

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个轻量级的表示级反事实框架，为去偏和可靠的多模态推理提供了实用的因果途径

Abstract: Object-context shortcuts remain a persistent challenge in vision-language
models, undermining zero-shot reliability when test-time scenes differ from
familiar training co-occurrences. We recast this issue as a causal inference
problem and ask: Would the prediction remain if the object appeared in a
different environment? To answer this at inference time, we estimate object and
background expectations within CLIP's representation space, and synthesize
counterfactual embeddings by recombining object features with diverse
alternative contexts sampled from external datasets, batch neighbors, or
text-derived descriptions. By estimating the Total Direct Effect and simulating
intervention, we further subtract background-only activation, preserving
beneficial object-context interactions while mitigating hallucinated scores.
Without retraining or prompt design, our method substantially improves both
worst-group and average accuracy on context-sensitive benchmarks, establishing
a new zero-shot state of the art. Beyond performance, our framework provides a
lightweight representation-level counterfactual approach, offering a practical
causal avenue for debiased and reliable multimodal reasoning.

Motivation: 现有的LVLM自我改进范式存在"马太效应"问题：模型在简单查询上表现良好，但在复杂查询上表现不佳，导致优化不平衡，阻碍了模型进一步改进。

Method: 提出了四种高效策略，从两个角度入手：分布重塑和轨迹重采样，在探索-学习自我改进过程中实现头尾数据重新平衡。

Result: 在Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct和InternVL2.5-4B模型上的广泛实验表明，该方法持续提升视觉推理能力，平均比原始自我改进方法高出3.86分。

Conclusion: 通过平衡头尾数据的优化，提出的方法有效缓解了自我改进过程中的马太效应，突破了性能瓶颈，显著提升了LVLM的复杂推理能力。

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for advancing the
reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), where models
explore and learn from successful trajectories iteratively. However, we
identify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating
high-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles
with more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced
optimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while
hindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,
this imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the "Matthew
effect"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to
performance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four
efficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and
trajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the
exploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on
Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks
demonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning
capabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.

Abstract: The edge detection task is essential in image processing aiming to extract
relevant information from an image. One recurring problem in this task is the
weaknesses found in some detectors, such as the difficulty in detecting loose
edges and the lack of context to extract relevant information from specific
problems. To address these weaknesses and adapt the detector to the properties
of an image, an adaptable detector described by two-dimensional cellular
automaton and optimized by meta-heuristic combined with transfer learning
techniques was developed. This study aims to analyze the impact of expanding
the search space of the optimization phase and the robustness of the
adaptability of the detector in identifying edges of a set of natural images
and specialized subsets extracted from the same image set. The results obtained
prove that expanding the search space of the optimization phase was not
effective for the chosen image set. The study also analyzed the adaptability of
the model through a series of experiments and validation techniques and found
that, regardless of the validation, the model was able to adapt to the input
and the transfer learning techniques applied to the model showed no significant
improvements.

Conclusion: SA²Net作为一种有前景的工具，在智能脊柱图像分析中具有推进脊柱侧弯诊断的潜力。

Abstract: Spine segmentation, based on ultrasound volume projection imaging (VPI),
plays a vital role for intelligent scoliosis diagnosis in clinical
applications. However, this task faces several significant challenges. Firstly,
the global contextual knowledge of spines may not be well-learned if we neglect
the high spatial correlation of different bone features. Secondly, the spine
bones contain rich structural knowledge regarding their shapes and positions,
which deserves to be encoded into the segmentation process. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel scale-adaptive structure-aware network
(SA$^{2}$Net) for effective spine segmentation. First, we propose a
scale-adaptive complementary strategy to learn the cross-dimensional
long-distance correlation features for spinal images. Second, motivated by the
consistency between multi-head self-attention in Transformers and semantic
level affinity, we propose structure-affinity transformation to transform
semantic features with class-specific affinity and combine it with a
Transformer decoder for structure-aware reasoning. In addition, we adopt a
feature mixing loss aggregation method to enhance model training. This method
improves the robustness and accuracy of the segmentation process. The
experimental results demonstrate that our SA$^{2}$Net achieves superior
segmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover,
the adaptability of SA$^{2}$Net to various backbones enhances its potential as
a promising tool for advanced scoliosis diagnosis using intelligent spinal
image analysis. The code and experimental demo are available at

Abstract: In real-world environments, AI systems often face unfamiliar scenarios
without labeled data, creating a major challenge for conventional scene
understanding models. The inability to generalize across unseen contexts limits
the deployment of vision-based applications in dynamic, unstructured settings.
This work introduces a Dynamic Context-Aware Scene Reasoning framework that
leverages Vision-Language Alignment to address zero-shot real-world scenarios.
The goal is to enable intelligent systems to infer and adapt to new
environments without prior task-specific training. The proposed approach
integrates pre-trained vision transformers and large language models to align
visual semantics with natural language descriptions, enhancing contextual
comprehension. A dynamic reasoning module refines predictions by combining
global scene cues and object-level interactions guided by linguistic priors.
Extensive experiments on zero-shot benchmarks such as COCO, Visual Genome, and
Open Images demonstrate up to 18% improvement in scene understanding accuracy
over baseline models in complex and unseen environments. Results also show
robust performance in ambiguous or cluttered scenes due to the synergistic
fusion of vision and language. This framework offers a scalable and
interpretable approach for context-aware reasoning, advancing zero-shot
generalization in dynamic real-world settings.

Method: 提出域分类器识别输入图像类型，以及包含提示适配器和视觉适配器的双适配器机制，通过统一钩子接口动态注入，无需重新训练骨干模型。

Conclusion: CATCH为多域VQA提供了可扩展和可扩展的方法，能够在不同应用领域实现实际部署。

Abstract: Recent advances in Visual Question Answering (VQA) have demonstrated
impressive performance in natural image domains, with models like LLaVA
leveraging large language models (LLMs) for open-ended reasoning. However,
their generalization degrades significantly when transferred to out-of-domain
scenarios such as remote sensing, medical imaging, or math diagrams, due to
large distributional shifts and the lack of effective domain adaptation
mechanisms. Existing approaches typically rely on per-domain fine-tuning or
bespoke pipelines, which are costly, inflexible, and not scalable across
diverse tasks. In this paper, we propose CATCH, a plug-and-play framework for
cross-domain adaptation that improves the generalization of VQA models while
requiring minimal changes to their core architecture. Our key idea is to
decouple visual and linguistic adaptation by introducing two lightweight
modules: a domain classifier to identify the input image type, and a dual
adapter mechanism comprising a Prompt Adapter for language modulation and a
Visual Adapter for vision feature adjustment. Both modules are dynamically
injected via a unified hook interface, requiring no retraining of the backbone
model. Experimental results across four domain-specific VQA benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework achieves consistent performance gains without
retraining the backbone model, including +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on
MedVQA-RAD, and +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA. These results highlight that CATCH
provides a scalable and extensible approach to multi-domain VQA, enabling
practical deployment across diverse application domains.

Abstract: We introduce Emu3.5, a large-scale multimodal world model that natively
predicts the next state across vision and language. Emu3.5 is pre-trained
end-to-end with a unified next-token prediction objective on a corpus of
vision-language interleaved data containing over 10 trillion tokens, primarily
derived from sequential frames and transcripts of internet videos. The model
naturally accepts interleaved vision-language inputs and generates interleaved
vision-language outputs. Emu3.5 is further post-trained with large-scale
reinforcement learning to enhance multimodal reasoning and generation. To
improve inference efficiency, we propose Discrete Diffusion Adaptation (DiDA),
which converts token-by-token decoding into bidirectional parallel prediction,
accelerating per-image inference by about 20x without sacrificing performance.
Emu3.5 exhibits strong native multimodal capabilities, including long-horizon
vision-language generation, any-to-image (X2I) generation, and complex
text-rich image generation. It also exhibits generalizable world-modeling
abilities, enabling spatiotemporally consistent world exploration and
open-world embodied manipulation across diverse scenarios and tasks. For
comparison, Emu3.5 achieves performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image

results on a suite of interleaved generation tasks. We open-source Emu3.5 at

Abstract: Computational Super-Resolution (CSR) in fluorescence microscopy has, despite
being an ill-posed problem, a long history. At its very core, CSR is about
finding a prior that can be used to extrapolate frequencies in a micrograph
that have never been imaged by the image-generating microscope. It stands to
reason that, with the advent of better data-driven machine learning techniques,
stronger prior can be learned and hence CSR can lead to better results. Here,
we present ResMatching, a novel CSR method that uses guided conditional flow
matching to learn such improved data-priors. We evaluate ResMatching on 4
diverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset and compare its results
against 7 baselines. ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results,
demonstrating in all cases the best trade-off between data fidelity and
perceptual realism. We observe that CSR using ResMatching is particularly
effective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn, e.g. when the given
low-resolution images contain a lot of noise. Additionally, we show that
ResMatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior
distribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested use-cases,
enabling our method to deliver a pixel-wise data-uncertainty term that can

Abstract: Accurate and timely crop yield prediction is crucial for global food security
and modern agricultural management. Traditional methods often lack the
scalability and granularity required for precision farming. This paper
introduces CYPRESS (Crop Yield Prediction via Regression on Prithvi's Encoder
for Satellite Sensing), a deep learning model designed for high-resolution,
intra-field canola yield prediction. CYPRESS leverages a pre-trained,
large-scale geospatial foundation model (Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M) and adapts it for
a continuous regression task, transforming multi-temporal satellite imagery
into dense, pixel-level yield maps. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset from
the Canadian Prairies, CYPRESS demonstrates superior performance over existing
deep learning-based yield prediction models, highlighting the effectiveness of
fine-tuning foundation models for specialized agricultural applications. By
providing a continuous, high-resolution output, CYPRESS offers a more
actionable tool for precision agriculture than conventional classification or
county-level aggregation methods. This work validates a novel approach that
bridges the gap between large-scale Earth observation and on-farm
decision-making, offering a scalable solution for detailed agricultural
monitoring.

*Christoffer Koo Øhrstrøm,Ronja Güldenring,Lazaros Nalpantidis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Spiking Patches事件标记化方法，为事件相机设计，能保持事件的异步性和空间稀疏性，相比帧和体素方法在保持精度的同时显著提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将事件表示为帧或体素，虽然精度高但失去了事件相机的异步性和空间稀疏性特性，需要一种能保持这些独特属性的表示方法。

Method: 提出Spiking Patches标记化器，将异步稀疏事件流转换为标记表示，并在手势识别和物体检测任务中使用GNN、PCN和Transformer进行评估。

Result: Spiking Patches标记比体素标记推理速度快3.4倍，比帧快10.4倍，同时保持相同精度，在手势识别和物体检测上分别有3.8和1.4的绝对提升。

Conclusion: 事件标记化为事件视觉提供了新方向，是向保持事件相机特性方法迈进的重要一步。

Abstract: We propose tokenization of events and present a tokenizer, Spiking Patches,
specifically designed for event cameras. Given a stream of asynchronous and
spatially sparse events, our goal is to discover an event representation that
preserves these properties. Prior works have represented events as frames or as
voxels. However, while these representations yield high accuracy, both frames
and voxels are synchronous and decrease the spatial sparsity. Spiking Patches
gives the means to preserve the unique properties of event cameras and we show
in our experiments that this comes without sacrificing accuracy. We evaluate
our tokenizer using a GNN, PCN, and a Transformer on gesture recognition and
object detection. Tokens from Spiking Patches yield inference times that are up
to 3.4x faster than voxel-based tokens and up to 10.4x faster than frames. We
achieve this while matching their accuracy and even surpassing in some cases
with absolute improvements up to 3.8 for gesture recognition and up to 1.4 for
object detection. Thus, tokenization constitutes a novel direction in
event-based vision and marks a step towards methods that preserve the
properties of event cameras.

Abstract: To address the challenges in UAV object detection, such as complex
backgrounds, severe occlusion, dense small objects, and varying lighting
conditions,this paper proposes PT-DETR based on RT-DETR, a novel detection
algorithm specifically designed for small objects in UAV imagery. In the
backbone network, we introduce the Partially-Aware Detail Focus (PADF) Module

Furthermore,we incorporate Focaler-SIoU to strengthen the model's bounding box
matching capability and increase its sensitivity to small-object features,
thereby further enhancing detection accuracy and robustness. Compared with
RT-DETR, our PT-DETR achieves mAP improvements of 1.6% and 1.7% on the

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are transforming the future of transportation
through advances in intelligent perception, decision-making, and control
systems. However, their success is tied to one core capability, reliable object
detection in complex and multimodal environments. While recent breakthroughs in
Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable
progress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains
fragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperative
intelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking
analysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI
rather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically
reviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR,
and Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their
capabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their
potential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception
frameworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that
moves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based,
and cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a
cross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze
cutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to
hybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven
approaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language
Models (SLMs), and VLMs. By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey
delivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future
opportunities.

### [57] [Towards Reliable Sea Ice Drift Estimation in the Arctic Deep Learning Optical Flow on RADARSAT-2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26653)
*Daniela Martin,Joseph Gallego*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 首次大规模评估48个深度学习光流模型在RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR海冰图像上的表现，多个模型达到亚公里级精度，证明深度学习光流方法可有效应用于极地遥感的海冰漂移估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海冰漂移的准确估计对北极航行、气候研究和业务预报至关重要。传统光流方法依赖数学模型和强运动假设，在复杂场景中精度有限，而深度学习光流方法在计算机视觉领域已取得显著进展，但其在地球物理问题和卫星SAR图像中的应用仍待探索。

Method: 使用48个深度学习光流模型在RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR海冰图像上进行评估，通过端点误差(EPE)和Fl指标与GNSS跟踪浮标数据进行对比验证。

Result: 多个模型达到亚公里级精度（EPE 6-8像素，300-400米），相对于海冰运动的空间尺度和北极典型导航需求而言误差较小。模型能够捕捉一致的区域漂移模式。

Conclusion: 深度学习光流方法相比传统方法显著提高了运动估计精度，可有效迁移到极地遥感中。光流产生空间连续的漂移场，为每个图像像素提供运动估计，为导航和气候建模提供了新机遇。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of sea ice drift is critical for Arctic navigation,
climate research, and operational forecasting. While optical flow, a computer
vision technique for estimating pixel wise motion between consecutive images,
has advanced rapidly in computer vision, its applicability to geophysical
problems and to satellite SAR imagery remains underexplored. Classical optical
flow methods rely on mathematical models and strong assumptions about motion,
which limit their accuracy in complex scenarios. Recent deep learning based
approaches have substantially improved performance and are now the standard in
computer vision, motivating their application to sea ice drift estimation. We
present the first large scale benchmark of 48 deep learning optical flow models
on RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR sea ice imagery, evaluated with endpoint error (EPE) and
Fl all metrics against GNSS tracked buoys. Several models achieve sub kilometer
accuracy (EPE 6 to 8 pixels, 300 to 400 m), a small error relative to the
spatial scales of sea ice motion and typical navigation requirements in the
Arctic. Our results demonstrate that the models are capable of capturing
consistent regional drift patterns and that recent deep learning based optical
flow methods, which have substantially improved motion estimation accuracy
compared to classical methods, can be effectively transferred to polar remote
sensing. Optical flow produces spatially continuous drift fields, providing
motion estimates for every image pixel rather than at sparse buoy locations,
offering new opportunities for navigation and climate modeling.

Abstract: The presence of occlusions has provided substantial challenges to
typically-powerful object recognition algorithms. Additional sources of
information can be extremely valuable to reduce errors caused by occlusions.
Scene context is known to aid in object recognition in biological vision. In
this work, we attempt to add robustness into existing Region Proposal
Network-Deep Convolutional Neural Network (RPN-DCNN) object detection networks
through two distinct scene-based information fusion techniques. We present one
algorithm under each methodology: the first operates prior to prediction,
selecting a custom object network to use based on the identified background
scene, and the second operates after detection, fusing scene knowledge into
initial object scores output by the RPN. We demonstrate our algorithms on
challenging datasets featuring partial occlusions, which show overall
improvement in both recall and precision against baseline methods. In addition,
our experiments contrast multiple training methodologies for occlusion
handling, finding that training on a combination of both occluded and
unoccluded images demonstrates an improvement over the others. Our method is
interpretable and can easily be adapted to other datasets, offering many future
directions for research and practical applications.

Conclusion: SteerVLM通过激活工程为多模态模型控制提供了稳健解决方案，实现了推理时对复杂输出语义的精细控制。

Abstract: This work introduces SteerVLM, a lightweight steering module designed to
guide Vision-Language Models (VLMs) towards outputs that better adhere to
desired instructions. Our approach learns from the latent embeddings of paired
prompts encoding target and converse behaviors to dynamically adjust
activations connecting the language modality with image context. This allows
for fine-grained, inference-time control over complex output semantics without
modifying model weights while preserving performance on off-target tasks. Our
steering module requires learning parameters equal to 0.14% of the original
VLM's size. Our steering module gains model control through dimension-wise
activation modulation and adaptive steering across layers without requiring
pre-extracted static vectors or manual tuning of intervention points.
Furthermore, we introduce VNIA (Visual Narrative Intent Alignment), a
multimodal dataset specifically created to facilitate the development and
evaluation of VLM steering techniques. Our method outperforms existing
intervention techniques on steering and hallucination mitigation benchmarks for
VLMs and proposes a robust solution for multimodal model control through
activation engineering.

Abstract: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the leading causes of
irreversible vision impairment in people over the age of 60. This research
focuses on semantic segmentation for AMD lesion detection in RGB fundus images,
a non-invasive and cost-effective imaging technique. The results of the ADAM

Abstract: Charts play an important role in visualization, reasoning, data analysis, and
the exchange of ideas among humans. However, existing vision-language models
(VLMs) still lack accurate perception of details and struggle to extract
fine-grained structures from charts. Such limitations in chart grounding also
hinder their ability to compare multiple charts and reason over them. In this
paper, we introduce a novel "ChartAlign Benchmark (ChartAB)" to provide a
comprehensive evaluation of VLMs in chart grounding tasks, i.e., extracting
tabular data, localizing visualization elements, and recognizing various
attributes from charts of diverse types and complexities. We design a JSON
template to facilitate the calculation of evaluation metrics specifically
tailored for each grounding task. By incorporating a novel two-stage inference
workflow, the benchmark can further evaluate VLMs' capability to align and
compare elements/attributes across two charts. Our analysis of evaluations on
several recent VLMs reveals new insights into their perception biases,
weaknesses, robustness, and hallucinations in chart understanding. These
findings highlight the fine-grained discrepancies among VLMs in chart
understanding tasks and point to specific skills that need to be strengthened
in current models.

Abstract: Hierarchical structures of motion exist across research fields, including
computer vision, graphics, and robotics, where complex dynamics typically arise
from coordinated interactions among simpler motion components. Existing methods
to model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic
hierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability
across different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion
modeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships
directly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based
hierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into
parent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy
inference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent
elemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies
through graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction
approach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and
dynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show
that our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,
and produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the
baseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,
data-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation
applicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks. Project Page:

Abstract: Despite recent advances in 3D human motion generation (MoGen) on standard
benchmarks, existing models still face a fundamental bottleneck in their
generalization capability. In contrast, adjacent generative fields, most
notably video generation (ViGen), have demonstrated remarkable generalization
in modeling human behaviors, highlighting transferable insights that MoGen can
leverage. Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive framework
that systematically transfers knowledge from ViGen to MoGen across three key
pillars: data, modeling, and evaluation. First, we introduce ViMoGen-228K, a
large-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples that
integrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motions
from web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGen
models. The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motion
triplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose
ViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from
MoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance
efficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that
eliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong
generalization. Finally, we present MBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed
for fine-grained evaluation across motion quality, prompt fidelity, and
generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that our framework
significantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic and human
evaluations. The code, data, and benchmark will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Determining the precise geographic location of an image at a global scale
remains an unsolved challenge. Standard image retrieval techniques are
inefficient due to the sheer volume of images (>100M) and fail when coverage is
insufficient. Scalable solutions, however, involve a trade-off: global
classification typically yields coarse results (10+ kilometers), while
cross-view retrieval between ground and aerial imagery suffers from a domain
gap and has been primarily studied on smaller regions. This paper introduces a
hybrid approach that achieves fine-grained geo-localization across a large
geographic expanse the size of a continent. We leverage a proxy classification
task during training to learn rich feature representations that implicitly
encode precise location information. We combine these learned prototypes with
embeddings of aerial imagery to increase robustness to the sparsity of
ground-level data. This enables direct, fine-grained retrieval over areas
spanning multiple countries. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that our
approach can localize within 200m more than 68\% of queries of a dataset
covering a large part of Europe. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: SEE4D是一个无需姿态标注的视频到4D内容合成框架，通过虚拟相机渲染和条件视频修复技术，从随意拍摄的视频中生成时空4D内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频到4D方法依赖手动标注的相机姿态，成本高且对野外视频不鲁棒。warp-then-inpaint方法虽无需姿态标签，但将相机运动与场景动态耦合，使建模和推理复杂化。

Method: 提出轨迹到相机框架，用固定虚拟相机渲染替代显式轨迹预测，将相机控制与场景建模分离。训练视图条件视频修复模型学习几何先验，通过时空自回归推理管道在虚拟相机样条上生成连贯内容。

Result: 在跨视图视频生成和稀疏重建基准测试中，SEE4D在定量指标和定性评估上均优于基于姿态或轨迹的基线方法，展现出更好的泛化能力和性能。

Conclusion: SEE4D通过分离相机控制与场景建模，实现了从随意视频中进行实用的4D世界建模，无需显式3D标注。

Abstract: Immersive applications call for synthesizing spatiotemporal 4D content from
casual videos without costly 3D supervision. Existing video-to-4D methods
typically rely on manually annotated camera poses, which are labor-intensive
and brittle for in-the-wild footage. Recent warp-then-inpaint approaches
mitigate the need for pose labels by warping input frames along a novel camera
trajectory and using an inpainting model to fill missing regions, thereby
depicting the 4D scene from diverse viewpoints. However, this
trajectory-to-trajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scene
dynamics and complicates both modeling and inference. We introduce SEE4D, a
pose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that replaces explicit trajectory
prediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras, thereby
separating camera control from scene modeling. A view-conditional video
inpainting model is trained to learn a robust geometry prior by denoising
realistically synthesized warped images and to inpaint occluded or missing
regions across virtual viewpoints, eliminating the need for explicit 3D
annotations. Building on this inpainting core, we design a spatiotemporal
autoregressive inference pipeline that traverses virtual-camera splines and
extends videos with overlapping windows, enabling coherent generation at
bounded per-step complexity. We validate See4D on cross-view video generation
and sparse reconstruction benchmarks. Across quantitative metrics and
qualitative assessments, our method achieves superior generalization and
improved performance relative to pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines,
advancing practical 4D world modeling from casual videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为掩码扩散字幕（MDC）的方法，通过图像条件掩码扩散语言模型学习视觉特征，在多种学术数据集上的线性探测实验表明该方法与自回归和对比方法具有竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自回归字幕方法中视觉学习信号强度依赖于标记在序列中位置的问题，减少对辅助目标的需求。

Method: 在训练过程中，随机掩码图像-字幕对中的文本标记，然后训练基于视觉特征的条件解码器来重建原始文本。

Result: 学习到的视觉特征在多种学术规模模型和数据集上的线性探测实验中，与自回归和对比方法产生的特征具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 掩码扩散字幕是一种有效的视觉特征学习方法，无需依赖辅助目标就能产生有竞争力的视觉表示。

Abstract: We learn visual features by captioning images with an image-conditioned
masked diffusion language model, a formulation we call masked diffusion
captioning (MDC). During training, text tokens in each image-caption pair are
masked at a randomly chosen ratio, and a decoder conditioned on visual features
is trained to reconstruct the original text. After training, the learned visual
features can be applied to downstream vision tasks. Unlike autoregressive
captioning, the strength of the visual learning signal in MDC does not depend
on each token's position in the sequence, reducing the need for auxiliary
objectives. Linear probing experiments across a variety of academic-scale
models and datasets show that the learned visual features are competitive with
those produced by autoregressive and contrastive approaches.

Motivation: 推进全景2D提升技术，生成适合基于物理渲染(PBR)、重新光照和模拟的图形就绪3D场景，超越现有仅关注外观生成的方法。

Method: 基于轻量高效的跨模态适配器结构，重新利用2D生成先验进行几何、纹理和PBR材质的全景感知，并构建大规模合成全景数据集。

Conclusion: OmniX框架通过重新利用2D生成先验，实现了多功能统一的全景视觉任务处理，推动了图形就绪3D场景生成技术的发展。

Abstract: There are two prevalent ways to constructing 3D scenes: procedural generation
and 2D lifting. Among them, panorama-based 2D lifting has emerged as a
promising technique, leveraging powerful 2D generative priors to produce
immersive, realistic, and diverse 3D environments. In this work, we advance
this technique to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physically
based rendering (PBR), relighting, and simulation. Our key insight is to
repurpose 2D generative models for panoramic perception of geometry, textures,
and PBR materials. Unlike existing 2D lifting approaches that emphasize
appearance generation and ignore the perception of intrinsic properties, we
present OmniX, a versatile and unified framework. Based on a lightweight and
efficient cross-modal adapter structure, OmniX reuses 2D generative priors for
a broad range of panoramic vision tasks, including panoramic perception,
generation, and completion. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale synthetic
panorama dataset containing high-quality multimodal panoramas from diverse
indoor and outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model in panoramic visual perception and graphics-ready 3D scene
generation, opening new possibilities for immersive and physically realistic
virtual world generation.

Motivation: 研究视频生成模型是否能够作为零样本推理器在视觉推理场景中发挥作用，系统评估其推理能力。

Method: 通过构建MME-CoF基准测试，在12个维度上系统评估Veo-3的推理行为，包括空间、几何、物理、时间和具身逻辑等方面。

Result: 视频模型在短时空间一致性、细粒度定位和局部一致动态方面表现出有希望的推理模式，但在长时因果推理、严格几何约束和抽象逻辑方面存在局限。

Conclusion: 当前视频模型还不能作为独立的零样本推理器，但可以作为专用推理模型的补充视觉引擎，展现出令人鼓舞的潜力。

Abstract: Recent video generation models can produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent
videos, indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge. Beyond
realistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual
perception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still
remains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging
visual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to
comprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular
Veo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including
spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically
characterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study,
we curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables
in-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our
findings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning
patterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and
locally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal
reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are
not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging
signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.

TL;DR: 提出了StreetMath基准来评估LLM在现实近似场景下的近似推理能力，发现LLM倾向于计算精确值而非近似，且近似运算与精确运算依赖不同的神经组件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLM在精确算术运算中的表现，但对其在非正式、快速数学运算中的近似推理能力研究不足，特别是在非自回归解码器模型中。

Method: 引入StreetMath基准，在不同LLM架构上进行广泛评估，并应用机制可解释性技术探查其内部计算状态。

Result: LLM在需要近似的任务中仍试图计算精确值或调用外部工具；虽然有时在早期层就得到正确答案，但仍消耗更多token；精确和近似算术运算依赖不同的神经组件。

Conclusion: LLM在街头数学场景中不像人类那样表现出认知吝啬性，近似推理能力有待改进。

Abstract: There is a substantial body of literature examining the mathematical
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
performance on precise arithmetic operations in autoregressive architectures.
However, their ability to perform approximate reasoning in informal, fast-paced
mathematical operations has received far less attention, especially among
non-autoregressive decoder models. Our work addresses this gap by introducing
StreetMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate models' approximation abilities
under real-world approximation scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluations
across different LLM architectures: Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507,
Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507, Dream-v0-Instruct-7B, Falcon-Mamba-7B-Instruct, and
Mamba-GPT-3B. Furthermore, we apply mechanistic interpretability techniques to
probe their internal computational states. Our analysis reveals that LLMs
generally attempt to compute exact values or invoke external tools even in
tasks that call for approximation. Moreover, while models sometimes reach the
correct answer in early layers or steps, they still consume more tokens when
solving approximation tasks. Additional experiments indicate that exact and
approximate arithmetic operations rely on largely separate neural components.
Drawing upon research on cognitive psychology, we argue that LLMs do not
exhibit cognitive miserliness in the same way humans do in street math
settings. We open source our work https://github.com/ctseng777/StreetMath

Motivation: 传统的基于词典的情感分析方法没有考虑意见的强度差异，无法区分非常强烈、强烈、中等、非常弱和弱等不同强度的情感表达。

Method: 结合意见词（副词、形容词、名词、动词）与产品特定方面，使用模糊逻辑算法将意见词分类到不同类别，并通过句法依赖解析找到与目标方面词的关系。

Result: 能够对实体评论进行细粒度强度分类，并计算实体在特定方面的得分，实现对实体的排名。

Conclusion: 该方法能够更准确地分析情感强度，为基于意见的实体排名提供更精细化的解决方案。

Abstract: Opinion mining, also called sentiment analysis, is the field of study that
analyzes people opinions, sentiments, evaluations, appraisals, attitudes, and
emotions towards entities such as products, services, organizations,
individuals, issues, events, topics, and their attributes. Holistic
lexicon-based approach does not consider the strength of each opinion, i.e.,
whether the opinion is very strongly negative (or positive), strongly negative
(or positive), moderate negative (or positive), very weakly negative (or
positive) and weakly negative (or positive). In this paper, we propose approach
to rank entities based on orientation and strength of the entity reviews and
user's queries by classifying them in granularity levels (i.e. very weak, weak,
moderate, very strong and strong) by combining opinion words (i.e. adverb,
adjective, noun and verb) that are related to aspect of interest of certain
product. We shall use fuzzy logic algorithmic approach in order to classify
opinion words into different category and syntactic dependency resolution to
find relations for desired aspect words. Opinion words related to certain
aspects of interest are considered to find the entity score for that aspect in
the review.

Motivation: 当前立场检测研究主要集中在目标依赖任务上，且大多数基准数据集基于英语，难以在韩语等低资源语言中开发模型。

Method: 从韩国政党新闻稿中收集数据，构建了563,299个标注韩语句子的LASTIST数据集，并训练了最先进的深度学习模型。

Result: 创建了适用于目标无关立场检测和历时演化立场检测等多种任务的韩语立场检测数据集。

Conclusion: LASTIST数据集为韩语立场检测研究提供了重要资源，解决了低资源语言在该领域的研究空白。

Abstract: Stance detection has emerged as an area of research in the field of
artificial intelligence. However, most research is currently centered on the
target-dependent stance detection task, which is based on a person's stance in
favor of or against a specific target. Furthermore, most benchmark datasets are
based on English, making it difficult to develop models in low-resource
languages such as Korean, especially for an emerging field such as stance
detection. This study proposes the LArge-Scale Target-Independent STance
(LASTIST) dataset to fill this research gap. Collected from the press releases
of both parties on Korean political parties, the LASTIST dataset uses 563,299
labeled Korean sentences. We provide a detailed description of how we collected
and constructed the dataset and trained state-of-the-art deep learning and
stance detection models. Our LASTIST dataset is designed for various tasks in
stance detection, including target-independent stance detection and diachronic
evolution stance detection. We deploy our dataset on

TL;DR: 提出zFLoRA，一种零延迟的融合低秩适配器，在基础模型上引入零或可忽略的延迟开销，解决了传统适配器在推理时计算开销过大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型部署时使用任务特定的适配器，虽然适配器参数较少（通常小于基础模型的1%），但在推理时会产生不成比例的计算开销（高达基础模型的2.5倍）。

Method: 提出零延迟融合低秩适配器（zFLoRA），通过融合技术消除适配器带来的额外延迟。

Result: 在1B、3B和7B规模的LLM上，zFLoRA在18个不同任务（包括常识推理、数学推理和摘要对话）中表现优于流行的监督微调基准，包括低秩适配器（LoRA）和全微调（FFT）。在NPU和GPU平台上的延迟测量显示zFLoRA引入零到可忽略的延迟开销。

Conclusion: zFLoRA是一种高效的适配器方法，能够在保持性能的同时消除推理延迟，适用于多下游应用的LLM部署。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed with task-specific
adapters catering to multiple downstream applications. In such a scenario, the
additional compute associated with these apparently insignificant number of
adapter parameters (typically less than 1% of the base model) turns out to be
disproportionately significant during inference time (upto 2.5x times that of
the base model). In this paper, we propose a new zero-latency fused low-rank
adapter (zFLoRA) that introduces zero or negligible latency overhead on top of
the base model. Experimental results on LLMs of size 1B, 3B and 7B show that
zFLoRA compares favorably against the popular supervised fine-tuning benchmarks
including low-rank adapters (LoRA) as well as full fine-tuning (FFT).
Experiments are conducted on 18 different tasks across three different
categories namely commonsense reasoning, math reasoning and summary-dialogue.
Latency measurements made on NPU (Samsung Galaxy S25+) as well as GPU (NVIDIA
H100) platforms show that the proposed zFLoRA adapters introduce zero to
negligible latency overhead.

balancing performance and faithfulness. Third, we replace the standard greedy

Abstract: Human experts often struggle to select the best option from a large set of
items with multiple competing objectives, a process bottlenecked by the
difficulty of formalizing complex, implicit preferences. To address this, we
introduce LISTEN, a framework that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) as a
zero-shot preference oracle, guided only by an expert's high-level priorities
in natural language. To operate within LLM constraints like context windows and
inference costs, we propose two iterative algorithms: LISTEN-U, which uses the
LLM to refine a parametric utility function, and LISTEN-T, a non-parametric
method that performs tournament-style selections over small batches of
solutions. Evaluated on diverse tasks including flight booking, shopping, and
exam scheduling, our results show LISTEN-U excels when preferences are
parametrically aligned (a property we measure with a novel concordance metric),
while LISTEN-T offers more robust performance. This work explores a promising
direction for steering complex multi-objective decisions directly with natural
language, reducing the cognitive burden of traditional preference elicitation.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that different large language models (LLMs) converge to
similar and accurate input embedding representations for numbers. These
findings conflict with the documented propensity of LLMs to produce erroneous
outputs when dealing with numeric information. In this work, we aim to explain
this conflict by exploring how language models manipulate numbers and quantify
the lower bounds of accuracy of these mechanisms. We find that despite
surfacing errors, different language models learn interchangeable
representations of numbers that are systematic, highly accurate and universal
across their hidden states and the types of input contexts. This allows us to
create universal probes for each LLM and to trace information -- including the
causes of output errors -- to specific layers. Our results lay a fundamental
understanding of how pre-trained LLMs manipulate numbers and outline the
potential of more accurate probing techniques in addressed refinements of LLMs'
architectures.

TL;DR: LongFilter是一个用于长上下文预训练的数据筛选框架，通过对比模型在长上下文和短上下文设置下的预测差异，识别需要长距离依赖的样本，从而高效选择高质量训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的长文本数据大多缺乏有意义的长距离依赖关系，大部分内容仅通过局部上下文即可预测，在这种数据上训练效率低下，因此需要精心筛选数据。

Method: LongFilter通过对比模型在长上下文和短上下文设置下的预测结果来衡量扩展上下文提供的信息增益，从而识别那些长距离依赖至关重要的样本。

Result: 在LLaMA-3-8B模型上的实验表明，LongFilter能高效选择高质量数据，将上下文长度从8K扩展到64K，并在HELMET、LongBench和RULER等基准测试上取得显著改进。

Conclusion: LongFilter框架能够有效筛选适合长上下文预训练的数据，提高训练效率并在多个基准测试上带来实质性改进。

Abstract: Long-context language models unlock advanced capabilities in reasoning, code
generation, and document summarization by leveraging dependencies across
extended spans of text. However, a significant portion of readily available
long-text data lacks meaningful long-distance dependencies; most spans can be
predicted using only local context. Training on such data is inefficient,
making careful data selection crucial. Therefore, we introduce LongFilter, a
framework for curating training data tailored to long-context pretraining.
LongFilter measures the information gain provided by extended context by
contrasting model predictions under long-context versus short-context settings,
thereby identifying samples where long-range dependencies are essential.
Experiments with LLaMA-3-8B, extending its context length from 8K to 64K, show
that LongFilter efficiently selects high-quality data and yields substantial
improvements on benchmarks such as HELMET, LongBench, and RULER.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在内容审核系统中的广泛应用，确保其公平性和中立性变得至关重要。本研究旨在探究角色设定如何影响不同LLM架构、模型大小和内容模态下有害内容分类的一致性和公平性。

Method: 通过分析不同意识形态倾向的角色设定对有害内容分类的影响，研究比较了不同LLM架构、模型大小和内容模态下的表现。进行了额外的政治针对性任务研究，验证角色设定在意识形态一致性方面的效应。

Result: 表面指标显示角色设定对整体分类准确率影响不大，但深入分析发现重要行为变化。不同意识形态的角色对内容有害性的判断存在差异，特别是大型模型更倾向于与同意识形态角色保持一致，强化意识形态内一致性同时扩大跨意识形态分歧。

Conclusion: 角色设定会向LLM输出引入微妙的意识形态偏见，这对以中立为幌子可能强化党派观点的AI系统使用提出了担忧。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in content moderation
systems, where ensuring fairness and neutrality is essential. In this study, we
examine how persona adoption influences the consistency and fairness of harmful
content classification across different LLM architectures, model sizes, and
content modalities (language vs. vision). At first glance, headline performance
metrics suggest that personas have little impact on overall classification
accuracy. However, a closer analysis reveals important behavioral shifts.
Personas with different ideological leanings display distinct propensities to
label content as harmful, showing that the lens through which a model "views"
input can subtly shape its judgments. Further agreement analyses highlight that
models, particularly larger ones, tend to align more closely with personas from
the same political ideology, strengthening within-ideology consistency while
widening divergence across ideological groups. To show this effect more
directly, we conducted an additional study on a politically targeted task,
which confirmed that personas not only behave more coherently within their own
ideology but also exhibit a tendency to defend their perspective while
downplaying harmfulness in opposing views. Together, these findings highlight
how persona conditioning can introduce subtle ideological biases into LLM
outputs, raising concerns about the use of AI systems that may reinforce
partisan perspectives under the guise of neutrality.

Conclusion: 实体感知检索提高了临床自然语言处理的效率和准确性。评估框架为评估临床问答系统提供了可重用和透明的基准，其中语义精度和计算效率至关重要。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) store clinical documentation as base64
encoded attachments in FHIR DocumentReference resources, which makes semantic
question answering difficult. Traditional vector database methods often miss
nuanced clinical relationships. The Clinical Entity Augmented Retrieval (CLEAR)
method, introduced by Lopez et al. 2025, uses entity aware retrieval and
achieved improved performance with an F1 score of 0.90 versus 0.86 for
embedding based retrieval, while using over 70 percent fewer tokens. We
developed a Clinical Notes QA Evaluation Platform to validate CLEAR against
zero shot large context inference and traditional chunk based retrieval
augmented generation. The platform was tested on 12 clinical notes ranging from
10,000 to 65,000 tokens representing realistic EHR content. CLEAR achieved a
58.3 percent win rate, an average semantic similarity of 0.878, and used 78
percent fewer tokens than wide context processing. The largest performance
gains occurred on long notes, with a 75 percent win rate for documents
exceeding 65,000 tokens. These findings confirm that entity aware retrieval
improves both efficiency and accuracy in clinical natural language processing.
The evaluation framework provides a reusable and transparent benchmark for
assessing clinical question answering systems where semantic precision and
computational efficiency are critical.

Abstract: Post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for unlocking their
task generalization potential and domain-specific capabilities. However, the
current LLM post-training paradigm faces significant data challenges, including
the high costs of manual annotation and diminishing marginal returns on data
scales. Therefore, achieving data-efficient post-training has become a key
research question. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey of
data-efficient LLM post-training from a data-centric perspective. We propose a
taxonomy of data-efficient LLM post-training methods, covering data selection,
data quality enhancement, synthetic data generation, data distillation and
compression, and self-evolving data ecosystems. We summarize representative
approaches in each category and outline future research directions. By
examining the challenges in data-efficient LLM post-training, we highlight open
problems and propose potential research avenues. We hope our work inspires
further exploration into maximizing the potential of data utilization in
large-scale model training. Paper List:

TL;DR: 对CORE-KG框架进行消融研究，量化其两个关键组件（共指消解和结构化提示）在减少节点重复和噪声方面的贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律案件文档通常是非结构化、词汇密集且充满模糊或变化指称的，这给自动知识图谱构建带来挑战。现有LLM方法仍会产生噪声、碎片化的图谱和重复节点。

Method: 对CORE-KG框架进行系统性消融研究，分别移除共指消解模块和结构化提示，量化这两个组件对减少节点重复和噪声的贡献。

Result: 移除共指消解导致节点重复增加28.32%，噪声节点增加4.32%；移除结构化提示导致节点重复增加4.34%，噪声节点增加73.33%。

Conclusion: 研究结果为从复杂法律文本中提取结构化表示的鲁棒LLM管道设计提供了实证见解，强调了共指消解和结构化提示的重要性。

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze.
Legal case documents offer critical insights but are often unstructured,
lexically dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, which pose
significant challenges for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. While
recent LLM-based approaches improve over static templates, they still generate
noisy, fragmented graphs with duplicate nodes due to the absence of guided
extraction and coreference resolution. The recently proposed CORE-KG framework
addresses these limitations by integrating a type-aware coreference module and
domain-guided structured prompts, significantly reducing node duplication and
legal noise. In this work, we present a systematic ablation study of CORE-KG to
quantify the individual contributions of its two key components. Our results
show that removing coreference resolution results in a 28.32% increase in node
duplication and a 4.32% increase in noisy nodes, while removing structured
prompts leads to a 4.34% increase in node duplication and a 73.33% increase in
noisy nodes. These findings offer empirical insights for designing robust
LLM-based pipelines for extracting structured representations from complex
legal texts.

TL;DR: 本文评估了使用LLM进行FrameNet语义标注的性能，比较了手动、自动和半自动三种标注方式，发现半自动标注在帧多样性和标注覆盖率方面表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在语言资源创建中应用广泛，但对其在语义标注中的性能和影响缺乏全面评估，尤其是在视角化NLP方法下。

Method: 采用三种实验设置（手动、自动、半自动）比较标注时间、覆盖率和多样性，使用基于LLM的语义角色标注器进行FrameNet式语义标注。

Result: 半自动标注设置相比纯人工设置提高了帧多样性并保持相似标注覆盖率，而自动设置在除标注时间外的所有指标上都表现较差。

Conclusion: 混合半自动标注方法在语义标注任务中具有优势，能够平衡效率和质量，而纯自动标注方法在质量方面仍有不足。

Abstract: The use of LLM-based applications as a means to accelerate and/or substitute
human labor in the creation of language resources and dataset is a reality.
Nonetheless, despite the potential of such tools for linguistic research,
comprehensive evaluation of their performance and impact on the creation of
annotated datasets, especially under a perspectivized approach to NLP, is still
missing. This paper contributes to reduction of this gap by reporting on an
extensive evaluation of the (semi-)automatization of FrameNet-like semantic
annotation by the use of an LLM-based semantic role labeler. The methodology
employed compares annotation time, coverage and diversity in three experimental
settings: manual, automatic and semi-automatic annotation. Results show that
the hybrid, semi-automatic annotation setting leads to increased frame
diversity and similar annotation coverage, when compared to the human-only
setting, while the automatic setting performs considerably worse in all
metrics, except for annotation time.

TL;DR: RECAP是一种代理式管道，通过反馈驱动循环从LLM输出中提取和验证记忆的训练数据，包括越狱模块来克服对齐导致的拒绝。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当无法检查大语言模型的训练数据时，需要一种方法来验证模型是否见过特定内容，最有力的证据是模型能够自由复现目标内容。

Method: RECAP采用反馈驱动循环：初始提取尝试由次级语言模型评估，比较输出与参考段落并识别差异，然后将差异转化为最小修正提示反馈给目标模型指导后续生成，还包括检测和克服对齐拒绝的越狱模块。

Result: 在EchoTrace基准测试（涵盖30多本完整书籍）上，RECAP相比单次迭代方法有显著提升。使用GPT-4.1时，受版权文本提取的平均ROUGE-L分数从0.38提高到0.47，增长近24%。

Conclusion: RECAP能够有效提取和验证LLM记忆的训练数据，通过反馈循环和越狱机制显著提高了提取效果。

Abstract: If we cannot inspect the training data of a large language model (LLM), how
can we ever know what it has seen? We believe the most compelling evidence
arises when the model itself freely reproduces the target content. As such, we
propose RECAP, an agentic pipeline designed to elicit and verify memorized
training data from LLM outputs. At the heart of RECAP is a feedback-driven
loop, where an initial extraction attempt is evaluated by a secondary language
model, which compares the output against a reference passage and identifies
discrepancies. These are then translated into minimal correction hints, which
are fed back into the target model to guide subsequent generations. In
addition, to address alignment-induced refusals, RECAP includes a jailbreaking
module that detects and overcomes such barriers. We evaluate RECAP on
EchoTrace, a new benchmark spanning over 30 full books, and the results show
that RECAP leads to substantial gains over single-iteration approaches. For
instance, with GPT-4.1, the average ROUGE-L score for the copyrighted text
extraction improved from 0.38 to 0.47 - a nearly 24% increase.

TL;DR: 本研究挑战了多语言预训练中的常见假设，发现当语言在预训练语料中有足够token时，混合英语和多语言数据不会降低性能，英语作为枢纽语言有益于所有语系，且未观察到明显的"多语言诅咒"现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨多语言数据混合对大型语言模型预训练的影响，特别是关于语言覆盖范围与模型性能之间权衡的争议（即多语言诅咒问题）。

Method: 训练了1.1B和3B参数的LLM，使用包含25到400种语言的多语言语料库进行预训练，研究不同语言数量和数据平衡对模型性能的影响。

Result: 发现当语言有足够token时，英语和多语言数据结合不会降低性能；英语作为枢纽语言对所有语系都有益；增加训练语言数量未观察到显著的多语言诅咒现象。

Conclusion: 适当平衡的多语言数据可以增强语言模型能力而不损害性能，即使在低资源设置下也是如此。

Abstract: The impact of different multilingual data mixtures in pretraining large
language models (LLMs) has been a topic of ongoing debate, often raising
concerns about potential trade-offs between language coverage and model
performance (i.e., the curse of multilinguality). In this work, we investigate
these assumptions by training 1.1B and 3B parameter LLMs on diverse
multilingual corpora, varying the number of languages from 25 to 400. Our study
challenges common beliefs surrounding multilingual training. First, we find
that combining English and multilingual data does not necessarily degrade the
in-language performance of either group, provided that languages have a
sufficient number of tokens included in the pretraining corpus. Second, we
observe that using English as a pivot language (i.e., a high-resource language
that serves as a catalyst for multilingual generalization) yields benefits
across language families, and contrary to expectations, selecting a pivot
language from within a specific family does not consistently improve
performance for languages within that family. Lastly, we do not observe a
significant "curse of multilinguality" as the number of training languages
increases in models at this scale. Our findings suggest that multilingual data,
when balanced appropriately, can enhance language model capabilities without
compromising performance, even in low-resource settings

Motivation: 研究机器翻译中文化对齐对语义标签保存的影响，现有研究忽视了文化差异这一关键因素。

Method: 通过一系列实验，在文化敏感和中性领域测试不同机器翻译系统（包括大语言模型）的标签漂移情况。

Result: 发现机器翻译系统会导致标签漂移，大语言模型会编码文化知识并放大漂移，文化相似性是标签保存的关键决定因素。

Conclusion: 忽视机器翻译中的文化因素不仅会损害标签保真度，还会导致下游应用中的误解和文化冲突。

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) is widely employed to address resource scarcity in
low-resource languages by generating synthetic data from high-resource
counterparts. While sentiment preservation in translation has long been
studied, a critical but underexplored factor is the role of cultural alignment
between source and target languages. In this paper, we hypothesize that
semantic labels are drifted or altered during MT due to cultural divergence.
Through a series of experiments across culturally sensitive and neutral
domains, we establish three key findings: (1) MT systems, including modern
Large Language Models (LLMs), induce label drift during translation,
particularly in culturally sensitive domains; (2) unlike earlier statistical MT
tools, LLMs encode cultural knowledge, and leveraging this knowledge can
amplify label drift; and (3) cultural similarity or dissimilarity between
source and target languages is a crucial determinant of label preservation. Our
findings highlight that neglecting cultural factors in MT not only undermines
label fidelity but also risks misinterpretation and cultural conflict in
downstream applications.

TL;DR: SymCode是一个神经符号框架，将数学问题解决重新定义为使用SymPy库的可验证代码生成任务，显著提高了LLM在复杂数学推理中的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂数学推理中经常失败，基于文本的生成导致未经验证和算术不健全的解决方案，当前提示策略缺乏确定性验证机制。

Method: 引入SymCode框架，将数学问题解决重新定义为使用SymPy库的可验证代码生成任务，通过神经符号方法结合LLM和符号引擎。

Result: 在MATH-500和OlympiadBench等挑战性基准测试中，相比基线方法准确率提升高达13.6个百分点，且更节省token。

Conclusion: SymCode通过将LLM推理建立在确定性符号引擎基础上，代表了在形式化领域实现更准确和可信AI的关键一步。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning, where prose-based generation leads to unverified and arithmetically
unsound solutions. Current prompting strategies like Chain of Thought still
operate within this unreliable medium, lacking a mechanism for deterministic
verification. To address these limitations, we introduce SymCode, a
neurosymbolic framework that reframes mathematical problem-solving as a task of
verifiable code generation using the SymPy library. We evaluate SymCode on
challenging benchmarks, including MATH-500 and OlympiadBench, demonstrating
significant accuracy improvements of up to 13.6 percentage points over
baselines. Our analysis shows that SymCode is not only more token-efficient but
also fundamentally shifts model failures from opaque logical fallacies towards
transparent, programmatic errors. By grounding LLM reasoning in a deterministic
symbolic engine, SymCode represents a key step towards more accurate and
trustworthy AI in formal domains.

Motivation: Trainium AI加速器虽然为LLM训练和推理提供了成本效益高的解决方案，但其脉动阵列架构和数据布局的特殊要求使得实现高性能具有挑战性。

Method: 基于内核融合和新型缓存策略，减少软件管理内存层次结构中的数据移动，最大化SRAM带宽，避免昂贵的矩阵转置操作。

Conclusion: 针对Trainium架构定制化的优化技术能显著提升LLM推理性能，证明了所提方法的有效性。

Abstract: AI accelerators, customized to AI workloads, provide cost-effective and
high-performance solutions for training and inference. Trainium, an AI
accelerator recently developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS), provides an
attractive option for LLM training and inference through its heterogeneous
architecture. However, leveraging Trainium architecture for high performance
can be challenging because of its systolic array architecture and special
requirement on data layout. In this paper, we design high-performance matrix
multiplication (matmul), a critical compute kernel, for LLM inference on
Trainium. We introduce a series of techniques customized to Trainium based on
kernel fusion and novel caching strategies to reduce data movement across the
software-managed memory hierarchy, maximize SRAM bandwidth, and avoid expensive
matrix transpose. Evaluating with nine datasets and four recent LLMs, we show
that our system largely outperforms the state-of-the-art matmul implemented by
AWS on Trainium: at the level of matmul kernel, it achieves an average 1.35x
speedup (up to 2.22x), which translates to an average 1.66x speedup (up to
2.49x) for end-to-end LLM inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多实际工作负载仅依赖LLM的预填充阶段，其中自注意力计算因二次复杂度成为性能瓶颈。观察到语义不同的句子在不同层和头中会产生相似的注意力图。

Method: 基于注意力图记忆数据库，使用高效的缓存和相似性搜索技术来识别和重用预缓存的注意力图，减少自注意力的计算开销。

Result: 在CPU上平均实现1.2x端到端和2x注意力加速，在GPU上平均实现1.6x端到端和3x注意力加速，精度损失可忽略。

Conclusion: AttnCache通过重用相似注意力图有效加速LLM预填充阶段推理，显著降低计算开销同时保持模型精度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in generative applications such
as chatting, code generation, and reasoning. However, many realworld workloads
such as classification, question answering, recommendation, and text embedding
rely solely on the prefill stage of inference, where the model encodes input
sequences without performing autoregressive decoding. In these prefill only
scenarios, the self-attention computation becomes the primary performance
bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length. In
this paper, we observe that semantically different sentences often produce
similar attention maps across layers and heads. Building on this insight, we
propose AttnCache, a framework that accelerates the prefill stage of LLM
inference by retrieving and reusing similar attention maps. Based on an
attention map memorization database, AttnCache employs efficient caching and
similarity search techniques to identify and reuse pre-cached attention maps
during inference, thereby reducing the computational overhead of
self-attention. Experimental results show that AttnCache achieves an average of
1.2x end-to-end and 2x attention speedup on CPU, and 1.6x end-to-end and 3x
attention speedup on GPU, with negligible accuracy degradation.

TL;DR: 提出了监督强化学习(SRL)框架，将问题解决重新定义为生成逻辑行动序列，通过内部推理独白和基于专家行动相似性的逐步奖励，解决了小规模开源模型在多步推理任务中的训练难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多步推理任务中表现不佳，小规模开源模型面临两个问题：基于可验证奖励的强化学习(RLVR)在正确解决方案罕见时失效，监督微调(SFT)容易通过僵化的逐令牌模仿过度拟合长演示。

Method: SRL将问题解决重新定义为生成逻辑行动序列，训练模型在提交每个行动前生成内部推理独白。它基于模型行动与从SFT数据集中提取的专家行动之间的相似性提供逐步奖励，即使在所有rollout都不正确时也能提供丰富的学习信号。

Result: SRL使小模型能够学习之前SFT或RLVR无法学习的挑战性问题。先用SRL初始化训练再用RLVR精炼可获得最强整体性能。SRL在智能软件工程任务中也表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SRL是一个强大且多功能的面向推理的LLM训练框架，通过结合监督学习和强化学习的优势，有效解决了小模型在多步推理任务中的训练挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with problems that require
multi-step reasoning. For small-scale open-source models, Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) fails when correct solutions are rarely
sampled even after many attempts, while Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to
overfit long demonstrations through rigid token-by-token imitation. To address
this gap, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a framework that
reformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical "actions". SRL
trains the model to generate an internal reasoning monologue before committing
to each action. It provides smoother rewards based on the similarity between
the model's actions and expert actions extracted from the SFT dataset in a
step-wise manner. This supervision offers richer learning signals even when all
rollouts are incorrect, while encouraging flexible reasoning guided by expert
demonstrations. As a result, SRL enables small models to learn challenging
problems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Moreover, initializing training
with SRL before refining with RLVR yields the strongest overall performance.
Beyond reasoning benchmarks, SRL generalizes effectively to agentic software
engineering tasks, establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework
for reasoning-oriented LLMs.

TL;DR: PORTool是一种基于强化学习的工具使用LLM训练方法，通过探索多种正确答案的轨迹来提升模型在动态工具调用环境中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于静态数据集训练的工具使用LLM只能模仿通用工具调用流程，无法探索可能的解决方案，在动态工具调用环境中表现有限。

Method: 使用强化学习生成多个轨迹，形成树状结构，基于产生正确答案和成功工具调用的能力为每个步骤分配奖励，计算分支相对优势和轨迹相对优势来训练LLM。

Result: 在包含17个工具的实验中，PORTool在最终准确率和工具调用步骤数量方面相比其他训练方法有显著提升。

Conclusion: PORTool通过强化学习探索多种轨迹的方法，有效提升了工具使用LLM在动态环境中的性能。

Abstract: Current tool-use large language models (LLMs) are trained on static datasets,
enabling them to interact with external tools and perform multi-step,
tool-integrated reasoning, which produces tool-call trajectories. However,
these models imitate how a query is resolved in a generic tool-call routine,
thereby failing to explore possible solutions and demonstrating limited
performance in an evolved, dynamic tool-call environment. In this work, we
propose PORTool, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that encourages a
tool-use LLM to explore various trajectories yielding the correct answer.
Specifically, this method starts with generating multiple rollouts for a given
query, and some of them share the first few tool-call steps, thereby forming a
tree-like structure. Next, we assign rewards to each step, based on its ability
to produce a correct answer and make successful tool calls. A shared step
across different trajectories receives the same reward, while different steps
under the same fork receive different rewards. Finally, these step-wise rewards
are used to calculate fork-relative advantages, blended with
trajectory-relative advantages, to train the LLM for tool use. The experiments
utilize 17 tools to address user queries, covering both time-sensitive and
time-invariant topics. We conduct ablation studies to systematically justify
the necessity and the design robustness of step-wise rewards. Furthermore, we
compare the proposed PORTool with other training approaches and demonstrate
significant improvements in final accuracy and the number of tool-call steps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨语言对齐虽然能促进多语言表示的对齐和知识迁移，但可能导致文化擦除问题，即模型无法提供与查询语言相关的文化特定响应。

Method: 提出了转移-本地化平面评估框架来量化知识转移和文化擦除的权衡，并开发了外科手术式引导方法，通过在模型不同层应用有针对性的激活引导来分离事实转移和文化特定知识。

Result: 研究发现现有CLA方法在六种语言中都一致地改善了事实转移，但直接以牺牲文化本地化为代价。模型内部表示显示，普遍事实转移和文化特定知识在不同层具有最优可控性。

Conclusion: 外科手术式引导方法能够通过在不同层应用针对性激活引导，有效平衡知识转移和文化本地化这两个竞争目标，克服现有对齐技术的局限性。

Abstract: Cross-lingual alignment (CLA) aims to align multilingual representations,
enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to seamlessly transfer knowledge across
languages. While intuitive, we hypothesize, this pursuit of representational
convergence can inadvertently cause "cultural erasure", the functional loss of
providing culturally-situated responses that should diverge based on the query
language. In this work, we systematically analyze this trade-off by introducing
a holistic evaluation framework, the transfer-localization plane, which
quantifies both desirable knowledge transfer and undesirable cultural erasure.
Using this framework, we re-evaluate recent CLA approaches and find that they
consistently improve factual transfer at the direct cost of cultural
localization across all six languages studied. Our investigation into the
internal representations of these models reveals a key insight: universal
factual transfer and culturally-specific knowledge are optimally steerable at
different model layers. Based on this finding, we propose Surgical Steering, a
novel inference-time method that disentangles these two objectives. By applying
targeted activation steering to distinct layers, our approach achieves a better
balance between the two competing dimensions, effectively overcoming the
limitations of current alignment techniques.

Motivation: 偶发甲状腺发现在非甲状腺指征的影像学检查中越来越常见，但其流行率、特征和临床后果仍不明确，需要系统评估。

Method: 使用基于transformer的自然语言处理管道，回顾性分析2017-2023年间115,683名无甲状腺病史患者的放射学报告，识别偶发甲状腺发现并提取结节特征。

Result: 7.8%的患者有偶发甲状腺发现，其中92.9%为结节。结节特征记录不完整，仅有44%报告了大小。有偶发甲状腺发现的患者甲状腺结节诊断、活检、甲状腺切除术和甲状腺癌诊断的几率更高。

factors. Results Among 115,683 patients (mean age, 56.8 [SD 17.2] years; 52.9%
women), 9,077 (7.8%) had an ITF, of which 92.9% were nodules. ITFs were more
likely in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was
ordered by oncology or internal medicine. Compared with chest CT, ITFs were
more likely via neck CT, PET, and nuclear medicine scans. Nodule
characteristics were poorly documented, with size reported in 44% and other
features in fewer than 15% (e.g. calcifications). Compared with patients
without ITFs, those with ITFs had higher odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis,
biopsy, thyroidectomy and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers were
papillary, and larger when detected after ITFs vs no ITF. Conclusions ITFs were
common and strongly associated with cascades leading to the detection of small,
low-risk cancers. These findings underscore the role of ITFs in thyroid cancer
overdiagnosis and the need for standardized reporting and more selective
follow-up.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了QCoder Benchmark评估框架，用于评估大语言模型在量子编程任务上的表现，支持量子模拟器环境和真实人类代码对比分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在需要与硬件设备交互的领域（如量子编程）表现未被充分探索，需要专门的评估框架来测试模型在真实量子编程环境中的能力。

Method: 开发QCoder Benchmark评估框架，包含两个关键特性：1）支持量子模拟器环境评估，提供电路深度、执行时间等域特定指标；2）整合真实编程竞赛中的人类代码提交，支持定量比较和定性分析。

Result: 实验显示先进模型如GPT-4o仅达到18.97%准确率，而基于推理的模型如o3可达78%准确率，超过了人类代码平均成功率（39.98%）。

Conclusion: QCoder Benchmark揭示了量子编程任务的挑战性，推理模型表现优于传统模型，该基准数据集和公共评估API将支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been applied to automatic
programming code generation. This task can be viewed as a language generation
task that bridges natural language, human knowledge, and programming logic.
However, it remains underexplored in domains that require interaction with
hardware devices, such as quantum programming, where human coders write Python
code that is executed on a quantum computer. To address this gap, we introduce
QCoder Benchmark, an evaluation framework that assesses LLMs on quantum
programming with feedback from simulated hardware devices. Our benchmark offers
two key features. First, it supports evaluation using a quantum simulator
environment beyond conventional Python execution, allowing feedback of
domain-specific metrics such as circuit depth, execution time, and error
classification, which can be used to guide better generation. Second, it
incorporates human-written code submissions collected from real programming
contests, enabling both quantitative comparisons and qualitative analyses of
LLM outputs against human-written codes. Our experiments reveal that even
advanced models like GPT-4o achieve only around 18.97% accuracy, highlighting
the difficulty of the benchmark. In contrast, reasoning-based models such as o3
reach up to 78% accuracy, outperforming averaged success rates of human-written
codes (39.98%). We release the QCoder Benchmark dataset and public evaluation
API to support further research.

*Feng Ju,Zeyu Qin,Rui Min,Zhitao He,Lingpeng Kong,Yi R. Fung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出1PNS训练范式，通过引入推理路径差异度（RPD）指标来选择和训练多样化的推理路径，显著提升模型输出的多样性和pass@k性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的"一个问题一个答案"（1P1S）训练方式导致模型输出多样性不足，限制了测试时扩展（TTS）的效果。

Method: 提出1PNS训练范式，引入RPD指标来度量多步推理链的语义差异，基于RPD选择最大多样性的解决方案集进行微调。

Result: 实验显示RPD选择的训练集产生更多样化的输出和更高的pass@k，在pass@16上平均提升2.80%，在AIME24上提升4.99%。

Conclusion: 1PNS训练范式能有效增强TTS的效果，通过增加推理路径多样性来提升模型性能。

Abstract: While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs), low diversity in model outputs often
becomes a bottleneck; this is partly caused by the common "one problem, one
solution" (1P1S) training practice, which provides a single canonical answer
and can push models toward a narrow set of reasoning paths. To address this, we
propose a "one problem, multiple solutions" (1PNS) training paradigm that
exposes the model to a variety of valid reasoning trajectories and thus
increases inference diversity. A core challenge for 1PNS is reliably measuring
semantic differences between multi-step chains of thought, so we introduce
Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD), a step-level metric that aligns and scores
Long Chain-of-Thought solutions to capture differences in intermediate
reasoning. Using RPD, we curate maximally diverse solution sets per problem and
fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Base. Experiments show that RPD-selected training yields
more varied outputs and higher pass@k, with an average +2.80% gain in pass@16
over a strong 1P1S baseline and a +4.99% gain on AIME24, demonstrating that
1PNS further amplifies the effectiveness of TTS. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 本文利用大型语言模型和提示工程研究说服技巧与语篇关系之间的关联，通过创建标注了说服技巧和语篇关系的银数据集，发现六个关键语篇关系在说服性文本中起重要作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏同时标注说服技巧和语篇关系的数据集，研究旨在探索这两种语言现象之间的关系，以帮助检测网络宣传和错误信息。

Method: 使用SemEval 2023 Task 3数据集作为基础，开发基于LLM的分类器标注PDTB 3.0语篇关系，评估了4个LLM和10种提示，创建了5个银数据集。

Result: 统计分析显示六个语篇关系（原因、目的、对比、原因+信念、让步、条件）在说服性文本中起关键作用，特别是在使用负载语言、夸张/最小化、重复和表达怀疑时。

Conclusion: 该研究为检测网络宣传和错误信息提供了见解，并增进了对有效沟通的一般理解。

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between Persuasion Techniques (PTs)
and Discourse Relations (DRs) by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and
prompt engineering. Since no dataset annotated with both PTs and DRs exists, we
took the SemEval 2023 Task 3 dataset labelled with 19 PTs as a starting point
and developed LLM-based classifiers to label each instance of the dataset with
one of the 22 PDTB 3.0 level-2 DRs. In total, four LLMs were evaluated using 10
different prompts, resulting in 40 unique DR classifiers. Ensemble models using
different majority-pooling strategies were used to create 5 silver datasets of
instances labelled with both persuasion techniques and level-2 PDTB senses. The
silver dataset sizes vary from 1,281 instances to 204 instances, depending on
the majority pooling technique used. Statistical analysis of these silver
datasets shows that six discourse relations (namely Cause, Purpose, Contrast,
Cause+Belief, Concession, and Condition) play a crucial role in persuasive
texts, especially in the use of Loaded Language, Exaggeration/Minimisation,
Repetition and to cast Doubt. This insight can contribute to detecting online
propaganda and misinformation, as well as to our general understanding of
effective communication.

TL;DR: 提出了MossNet，一种新颖的混合状态空间专家架构，模拟线性多头注意力机制，在语言建模和下游任务中优于类似规模的transformer和SSM架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SSM/GRM方法通常只模拟单个注意力头，可能限制了其表达能力，需要一种能模拟多头注意力的更强大架构。

Method: 使用混合专家（MoE）实现，不仅在通道混合MLP块中，还在时间混合SSM核中实现多个"注意力头"，创建混合状态空间专家架构。

Result: MossNet在语言建模和下游评估中优于类似模型大小和数据预算的transformer和SSM架构，在三星Galaxy S24 Ultra和Nvidia A100 GPU上显示出良好的运行时速度和资源使用。

Conclusion: MossNet是高效、高性能循环LLM架构的一个有前景的新方向，具有良好的可扩展性和性能优势。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced generative
applications in natural language processing (NLP). Recent trends in model
architectures revolve around efficient variants of transformers or
state-space/gated-recurrent models (SSMs, GRMs). However, prevailing
SSM/GRM-based methods often emulate only a single attention head, potentially
limiting their expressiveness. In this work, we propose MossNet, a novel
mixture-of-state-space-experts architecture that emulates a linear multi-head
attention (MHA). MossNet leverages a mixture-of-experts (MoE) implementation
not only in channel-mixing multi-layered perceptron (MLP) blocks but also in
the time-mixing SSM kernels to realize multiple "attention heads." Extensive
experiments on language modeling and downstream evaluations show that MossNet
outperforms both transformer- and SSM-based architectures of similar model size
and data budgets. Larger variants of MossNet, trained on trillions of tokens,
further confirm its scalability and superior performance. In addition,
real-device profiling on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and an Nvidia A100 GPU
demonstrate favorable runtime speed and resource usage compared to similarly
sized baselines. Our results suggest that MossNet is a compelling new direction
for efficient, high-performing recurrent LLM architectures.

*Allen Schmaltz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了相似性-距离-大小（SDM）语言模型，通过在最终层添加SDM激活层进行二元分类，将预训练的仅解码器Transformer模型转换为SDM模型，以提高指令遵循能力并减少弃权率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型在指令遵循任务中可能存在弃权率高的问题，需要改进模型的统计效率。

Method: 使用监督微调方法，在训练过程中通过最终层SDM激活层估计基变换，结合对比输入编码方案和在线生成的硬负例进行监督下一个token损失优化。

Result: 与强监督基线相比，SDM模型显著减少了弃权率，提高了统计效率。

Conclusion: SDM语言模型能够有效提升预训练语言模型的指令遵循能力，同时保持较低的弃权率。

Abstract: We introduce Similarity-Distance-Magnitude (SDM) language models (LMs), which
are sequence prediction models fine-tuned to maximize the proportion of
generations in the well-calibrated, high-probability region partitioned by a
final-layer SDM activation layer used for binary classification of
instruction-following. We demonstrate that existing pre-trained decoder-only
Transformer LMs can be readily converted into SDM LMs via supervised
fine-tuning, using the final-layer SDM activation layer during training to
estimate a change-of-base for a supervised next-token loss over a contrastive
input encoding scheme, with additional hard negative examples generated online
during training. This results in reduced abstentions (i.e., improved
statistical efficiency) compared to strong supervised baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RCScore是一个多维度框架，用于量化指令表述对LLM响应的影响，通过系统地将基准问题转换为多种指令风格来揭示传统指标未检测到的性能变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM评估通常依赖单一指令模板，忽视了模型对指令风格的敏感性，这对实际部署至关重要。

Method: 通过系统地将基准问题转换为多种指令风格，引入跨响应相似性(CRS)来衡量风格自一致性，并在十个LLM和四个推理基准上进行实验。

Result: 实验显示指令风格可使准确率变化高达16.7个百分点，确定性解码产生更稳定的输出，模型规模与跨风格一致性正相关。

Conclusion: RCScore提供了一种评估指令鲁棒性的原则性方法，一致性可作为模型可靠性的有价值代理指标。

Abstract: Current LLM evaluations often rely on a single instruction template,
overlooking models' sensitivity to instruction style-a critical aspect for
real-world deployments. We present RCScore, a multi-dimensional framework
quantifying how instruction formulation affects model responses. By
systematically transforming benchmark problems into multiple instruction
styles, RCScore reveals performance variations undetected by conventional
metrics. Our experiments across ten LLMs on four reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that instruction style can shift accuracy by up to 16.7% points. We
introduce Cross-Response Similarity (CRS), a method applying RCScore metrics to
measure stylistic self-consistency, and establish its strong correlation with
task accuracy, suggesting consistency as a valuable proxy for model
reliability. Additional findings show that deterministic decoding produces more
stylistically stable outputs, and model scale correlates positively with
cross-style consistency. RCScore offers a principled approach to assess
instruction robustness.

*Woojin Kim,Jaeyoung Do*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Token Timestep Allocation (TTA)方法，通过为每个token分配不同的时间步调度来解决扩散语言模型中的更新遗忘问题，显著提升了可控性和流畅度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型在实际应用中存在更新遗忘问题，即均匀且上下文无关的更新会导致token级波动，抹去早期的语义编辑并破坏累积细化过程，从而降低流畅性和连贯性。

Method: 提出Token Timestep Allocation (TTA)方法，通过为每个token分配不同的时间步调度来实现软语义排序：关键token早期冻结，不确定token持续细化。该方法可实例化为固定策略或自适应策略。

Result: 在情感控制任务中，TTA将准确率提高超过20%，困惑度降低近一半，且仅使用不到五分之一的时间步；在去毒化任务中，最大毒性从14.5降至12.2，困惑度从32.0降至26.0。

Conclusion: 通过时间步分配实现的软化排序是缓解更新遗忘、实现稳定可控扩散文本生成的关键机制。

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) enable fine-grained refinement, their
practical controllability remains fragile. We identify and formally
characterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform
and context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,
erasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement
process, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in
uniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token
ordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and
semantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are
frozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This
timestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an
adaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of
refinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies
uniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision
sources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment
control, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves
perplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers
maximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).
Together, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep
allocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving
stable and controllable diffusion text generation.

TL;DR: WIMHF方法使用稀疏自编码器解释人类反馈数据，识别可解释特征来理解偏好数据编码的内容，实现数据筛选和个性化微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类反馈可能以不可预测的方式改变语言模型，但实践者缺乏对反馈数据编码内容的清晰理解。现有方法需要预先指定假设，难以自动提取相关特征。

Method: 引入WIMHF方法，使用稀疏自编码器解释反馈数据，既能表征数据集能够测量的偏好，也能表征标注者实际表达的偏好。

Result: 在7个数据集上，WIMHF识别出少量人类可解释特征，这些特征占黑盒模型偏好预测信号的大部分。发现不同平台用户偏好差异显著，并识别出潜在不安全偏好。

Conclusion: WIMHF为实践者提供了理解和使用偏好数据的人类中心分析方法，支持有效数据筛选和细粒度个性化。

Abstract: Human feedback can alter language models in unpredictable and undesirable
ways, as practitioners lack a clear understanding of what feedback data
encodes. While prior work studies preferences over certain attributes (e.g.,
length or sycophancy), automatically extracting relevant features without
pre-specifying hypotheses remains challenging. We introduce What's In My Human
Feedback? (WIMHF), a method to explain feedback data using sparse autoencoders.
WIMHF characterizes both (1) the preferences a dataset is capable of measuring
and (2) the preferences that the annotators actually express. Across 7
datasets, WIMHF identifies a small number of human-interpretable features that
account for the majority of the preference prediction signal achieved by
black-box models. These features reveal a wide diversity in what humans prefer,
and the role of dataset-level context: for example, users on Reddit prefer
informality and jokes, while annotators in HH-RLHF and PRISM disprefer them.
WIMHF also surfaces potentially unsafe preferences, such as that LMArena users
tend to vote against refusals, often in favor of toxic content. The learned
features enable effective data curation: re-labeling the harmful examples in
Arena yields large safety gains (+37%) with no cost to general performance.
They also allow fine-grained personalization: on the Community Alignment
dataset, we learn annotator-specific weights over subjective features that
improve preference prediction. WIMHF provides a human-centered analysis method
for practitioners to better understand and use preference data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了GlobalQA基准来评估全局RAG能力，发现现有方法表现不佳，并开发了GlobalRAG框架显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG评估基准主要关注局部检索，但现实应用需要全局RAG能力来聚合跨文档信息，缺乏专门的评估标准。

Method: 提出GlobalRAG框架：通过块级检索保持结构连贯性，使用LLM驱动的智能过滤器去除噪声文档，集成聚合模块进行符号计算。

Result: 现有RAG方法在全局任务上表现很差（最强基线仅1.51 F1），而GlobalRAG在Qwen2.5-14B上达到6.63 F1，提升显著。

Conclusion: GlobalQA是首个专门评估全局RAG能力的基准，GlobalRAG框架有效解决了全局信息聚合的挑战，为实际应用提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a leading approach to
reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Current RAG evaluation
benchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant
chunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only
localized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world
applications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG --
which involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document
collections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, "What are the top 10
most cited papers in 2023?"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering
four core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k
extraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and
baselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks,
with the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these
challenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that
preserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates
LLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates
aggregation modules for precise symbolic computation. On the Qwen2.5-14B model,
GlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 compared to the strongest baseline's 1.51 F1,
validating the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: 通过提供语用学理论作为提示，引导语言模型进行逐步推理，显著提升了模型在理解隐含含义任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确理解隐含含义在人类交流中至关重要，语言模型也应具备这种能力。语用学理论为理解隐含含义提供了系统框架。

Method: 将语用学理论（如格赖斯语用学和关联理论）概述作为提示提供给语言模型，引导其通过逐步推理过程得出最终解释。

Result: 相比仅提示中间推理的基线方法，该方法使语言模型在语用推理任务上得分提高了9.6%。仅提及语用学理论名称也能在较大模型中带来1-3%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 将语用学理论作为提示是一种有效的上下文学习方法，能显著提升语言模型理解隐含含义的能力。

Abstract: The ability to accurately interpret implied meanings plays a crucial role in
human communication and language use, and language models are also expected to
possess this capability. This study demonstrates that providing language models
with pragmatic theories as prompts is an effective in-context learning approach
for tasks to understand implied meanings. Specifically, we propose an approach
in which an overview of pragmatic theories, such as Gricean pragmatics and
Relevance Theory, is presented as a prompt to the language model, guiding it
through a step-by-step reasoning process to derive a final interpretation.
Experimental results showed that, compared to the baseline, which prompts
intermediate reasoning without presenting pragmatic theories (0-shot
Chain-of-Thought), our methods enabled language models to achieve up to 9.6\%
higher scores on pragmatic reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we show that even
without explaining the details of pragmatic theories, merely mentioning their
names in the prompt leads to a certain performance improvement (around 1-3%) in
larger models compared to the baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究预训练语言模型是否具备类似人类说话者区分借词和原生词汇的能力，特别是在双语社区中主导语言对少数语言持续施加词汇影响的情况下。

Method: 评估了包括大语言模型在内的多个模型在10种语言上的表现，使用明确指令和上下文信息进行借词识别测试。

Result: 模型在区分借词和原生词方面表现很差，证实了现代NLP系统存在对借词而非原生等价词的偏见。

Conclusion: 这项研究对开发少数语言的NLP工具以及在主导语言词汇压力下支持语言保护具有重要意义。

Abstract: Throughout language history, words are borrowed from one language to another
and gradually become integrated into the recipient's lexicon. Speakers can
often differentiate these loanwords from native vocabulary, particularly in
bilingual communities where a dominant language continuously imposes lexical
items on a minority language. This paper investigates whether pretrained
language models, including large language models, possess similar capabilities
for loanword identification. We evaluate multiple models across 10 languages.
Despite explicit instructions and contextual information, our results show that
models perform poorly in distinguishing loanwords from native ones. These
findings corroborate previous evidence that modern NLP systems exhibit a bias
toward loanwords rather than native equivalents. Our work has implications for
developing NLP tools for minority languages and supporting language
preservation in communities under lexical pressure from dominant languages.

TL;DR: 本文通过实证研究分析了五种知识蒸馏方法在多语言视觉语言模型压缩中的表现，发现某些配置能在模型大小减半的情况下保持甚至提升多语言检索鲁棒性，但存在设计敏感的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在不同语言间表现不均，模型压缩时问题更严重。知识蒸馏在将大模型知识转移到小模型方面效果显著，但在多语言环境中的应用研究不足。

Method: 研究了CLIP和SigLIP2模型上的五种知识蒸馏方法，评估了它们在领域内检索和领域外视觉问答任务中的表现，重点关注跨语言表示一致性和下游性能稳定性。

Result: 研究发现某些蒸馏配置能在模型大小减半的情况下保持或改善多语言检索鲁棒性，但其他配置无法维持跨任务稳定性，揭示了仅靠聚合准确率无法发现的设计敏感权衡。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏在多语言视觉语言模型压缩中具有潜力，但需要仔细选择蒸馏方法以平衡模型大小、多语言鲁棒性和跨任务稳定性之间的权衡。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit uneven performance across languages, a
problem that is often exacerbated when the model size is reduced. While
Knowledge distillation (KD) demonstrates promising results in transferring
knowledge from larger to smaller VLMs, applying KD in multilingualism is an
underexplored area. This paper presents a controlled empirical study of KD
behavior across five distillation approaches, isolating their effects on
cross-lingual representation consistency and downstream performance stability
under model compression. We study five distillation formulations across CLIP
and SigLIP2, and evaluate them on in-domain retrieval and out-of-domain visual
QA. We find that some configurations preserve or even improve multilingual
retrieval robustness despite halving model size, but others fail to maintain
cross-task stability, exposing design-sensitive trade-offs that aggregate
accuracy alone does not reveal.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Neuron Agreement Decoding (NAD)方法，基于神经元激活稀疏性和跨样本一致性来选择最佳候选答案，无需外部信号或可比较文本输出，实现高效的无监督集成解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖外部输出信号（如token概率、熵或自评估），但这些信号在训练后可能校准不佳。研究发现内部神经元激活包含更丰富的信息，正确回答激活更少神经元且具有更强的一致性。

Method: NAD方法基于神经元激活的稀疏性和跨样本一致性来选择候选答案，仅使用内部信号，支持早期正确预测和激进早停。

Result: 在数学和科学基准测试中与多数投票相当；在开放式编码基准测试中优于Avg@64；通过早期修剪减少99%的token使用，生成质量损失最小。

Conclusion: 内部信号为无标签集成解码提供了可靠、可扩展且高效的指导，神经元激活模式是比外部信号更优的候选答案选择指标。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) commonly boost reasoning via
sample-evaluate-ensemble decoders, achieving label free gains without ground
truth. However, prevailing strategies score candidates using only external
outputs such as token probabilities, entropies, or self evaluations, and these
signals can be poorly calibrated after post training. We instead analyze
internal behavior based on neuron activations and uncover three findings: (1)
external signals are low dimensional projections of richer internal dynamics;
(2) correct responses activate substantially fewer unique neurons than
incorrect ones throughout generation; and (3) activations from correct
responses exhibit stronger cross sample agreement, whereas incorrect ones
diverge. Motivated by these observations, we propose Neuron Agreement Decoding
(NAD), an unsupervised best-of-N method that selects candidates using
activation sparsity and cross sample neuron agreement, operating solely on
internal signals and without requiring comparable textual outputs. NAD enables
early correctness prediction within the first 32 generated tokens and supports
aggressive early stopping. Across math and science benchmarks with verifiable
answers, NAD matches majority voting; on open ended coding benchmarks where
majority voting is inapplicable, NAD consistently outperforms Avg@64. By
pruning unpromising trajectories early, NAD reduces token usage by 99% with
minimal loss in generation quality, showing that internal signals provide
reliable, scalable, and efficient guidance for label free ensemble decoding.

Conclusion: Atlas展示了强大的分析处理能力，但在需要实时交互的动态网页环境中仍存在明显局限性。

Abstract: OpenAI's ChatGPT Atlas introduces new capabilities for web interaction,
enabling the model to analyze webpages, process user intents, and execute
cursor and keyboard inputs directly within the browser. While its capacity for
information retrieval tasks has been demonstrated, its performance in dynamic,
interactive environments remains less explored. In this study, we conduct an
early evaluation of Atlas's web interaction capabilities using browser-based
games as test scenarios, including Google's T-Rex Runner, Sudoku, Flappy Bird,
and Stein.world. We employ in-game performance scores as quantitative metrics
to assess performance across different task types. Our results show that Atlas
performs strongly in logical reasoning tasks like Sudoku, completing puzzles
significantly faster than human baselines, but struggles substantially in
real-time games requiring precise timing and motor control, often failing to
progress beyond initial obstacles. These findings suggest that while Atlas
demonstrates capable analytical processing, there remain notable limitations in
dynamic web environments requiring real-time interaction. The website of our

TL;DR: SCRIBE是一个用于教育反馈的多跳工具增强推理框架，通过两阶段LoRA微调将GPT-4o能力蒸馏到3B和8B模型，在保持隐私和低资源需求的同时，提供与大型模型相当的教育反馈质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决教育场景中语言模型部署的三个关键挑战：隐私问题、有限计算资源、需要教学有效的响应，要求小型开源模型能在本地运行并可靠地基于正确信息生成输出。

Method: 结合领域特定工具与自反式推理管道，支持迭代推理、工具使用和错误恢复，通过两阶段LoRA微调在GPT-4o生成的合成数据上蒸馏能力到3B和8B模型。

Result: 8B-SCRIBE模型在相关性和可操作性等关键维度上达到或超过更大模型的质量，学生评价与GPT-4o和Llama-3.3 70B相当，108名学生用户研究验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: SCRIBE证明了在低资源、隐私敏感的教育应用中部署小型高效模型的可行性，为教育技术提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Language models can be used to provide interactive, personalized student
feedback in educational settings. However, real-world deployment faces three
key challenges: privacy concerns, limited computational resources, and the need
for pedagogically valid responses. These constraints require small, open-source
models that can run locally and reliably ground their outputs in correct
information. We introduce SCRIBE, a framework for multi-hop, tool-augmented
reasoning designed to generate valid responses to student questions about
feedback reports. SCRIBE combines domain-specific tools with a self-reflective
inference pipeline that supports iterative reasoning, tool use, and error
recovery. We distil these capabilities into 3B and 8B models via two-stage LoRA
fine-tuning on synthetic GPT-4o-generated data. Evaluation with a human-aligned
GPT-Judge and a user study with 108 students shows that 8B-SCRIBE models
achieve comparable or superior quality to much larger models in key dimensions
such as relevance and actionability, while being perceived on par with GPT-4o
and Llama-3.3 70B by students. These findings demonstrate the viability of
SCRIBE for low-resource, privacy-sensitive educational applications.

TL;DR: ACER通过自动生成教科书式课程，将通用大语言模型转化为领域专家，在保持通用能力的同时显著提升专业领域表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在经济学、心理学等专业领域表现不佳的问题，这些领域需要深入的原则性理解。

Method: ACER方法：1）自动生成学科目录结构；2）基于布鲁姆分类法创建问答对；3）使用交错课程安排进行持续预训练，实现内容和认知维度的对齐学习。

Result: 在Llama 3.2模型上，微观经济学等挑战性领域准确率提升5个百分点，所有目标领域平均提升3个百分点，非目标领域也获得0.7点提升，ARC和GPQA基准提升超过2点，同时保持通用推理任务稳定。

Conclusion: ACER提供了一个可扩展且有效的方法，能够显著缩小大语言模型在关键领域的性能差距，同时避免灾难性遗忘并促进跨领域知识迁移。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at general tasks but underperform in
specialized domains like economics and psychology, which require deep,
principled understanding. To address this, we introduce ACER (Automated
Curriculum-Enhanced Regimen) that transforms generalist models into domain
experts without sacrificing their broad capabilities. ACER first synthesizes a
comprehensive, textbook-style curriculum by generating a table of contents for
a subject and then creating question-answer (QA) pairs guided by Bloom's
taxonomy. This ensures systematic topic coverage and progressively increasing
difficulty. The resulting synthetic corpus is used for continual pretraining
with an interleaved curriculum schedule, aligning learning across both content
and cognitive dimensions.
  Experiments with Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B) show significant gains in specialized
MMLU subsets. In challenging domains like microeconomics, where baselines
struggle, ACER boosts accuracy by 5 percentage points. Across all target
domains, we observe a consistent macro-average improvement of 3 percentage
points. Notably, ACER not only prevents catastrophic forgetting but also
facilitates positive cross-domain knowledge transfer, improving performance on
non-target domains by 0.7 points. Beyond MMLU, ACER enhances performance on
knowledge-intensive benchmarks like ARC and GPQA by over 2 absolute points,
while maintaining stable performance on general reasoning tasks. Our results
demonstrate that ACER offers a scalable and effective recipe for closing
critical domain gaps in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 健康相关错误信息普遍存在且有害，特别是那些扭曲或误解科学发现的论点难以识别，需要有效方法来增强LLM识别谬误论点的能力。

Method: 使用检索增强生成(RAG)生成合成谬误样本，然后对LLM模型进行轻量级微调，在有限计算资源下提升模型性能。

Result: 微调模型相比基线模型获得显著准确率提升，LLaMA 3.1 8B微调模型在MISSCI测试集上F1分数绝对提升超过35%。

Conclusion: 通过合成谬误数据增强有限的标注资源，可以显著提升LLM在真实世界科学错误信息任务上的零样本分类性能，即使计算资源有限也能取得良好效果。

Abstract: Health-related misinformation is very prevalent and potentially harmful. It
is difficult to identify, especially when claims distort or misinterpret
scientific findings. We investigate the impact of synthetic data generation and
lightweight fine-tuning techniques on the ability of large language models
(LLMs) to recognize fallacious arguments using the MISSCI dataset and
framework. In this work, we propose MisSynth, a pipeline that applies
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to produce synthetic fallacy samples,
which are then used to fine-tune an LLM model. Our results show substantial
accuracy gains with fine-tuned models compared to vanilla baselines. For
instance, the LLaMA 3.1 8B fine-tuned model achieved an over 35% F1-score
absolute improvement on the MISSCI test split over its vanilla baseline. We
demonstrate that introducing synthetic fallacy data to augment limited
annotated resources can significantly enhance zero-shot LLM classification
performance on real-world scientific misinformation tasks, even with limited
computational resources. The code and synthetic dataset are available on

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于交互的自动团队构建框架，通过语言模型图分析模型间的语义一致性来识别协同团队，无需了解模型内部架构或训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体方法虽然能超越单一模型能力，但成功依赖于协同团队组成。由于大多数模型的不透明性，难以了解其内部特性以进行有效协作。

Method: 构建语言模型图来映射模型间关系（基于成对对话的语义一致性），然后应用社区检测识别协同模型集群。通过特定主题引导对话来识别协同团队。

Result: 实验表明该方法能发现功能一致的模型群组，反映其潜在专长。识别的协同团队在下游基准测试中优于随机基线，与基于已知模型专长手动构建的团队准确率相当。

Conclusion: 为自动化设计协作多智能体LLM团队提供了新的基础。

Abstract: While a multi-agent approach based on large language models (LLMs) represents
a promising strategy to surpass the capabilities of single models, its success
is critically dependent on synergistic team composition. However, forming
optimal teams is a significant challenge, as the inherent opacity of most
models obscures the internal characteristics necessary for effective
collaboration. In this paper, we propose an interaction-centric framework for
automatic team composition that does not require any prior knowledge including
their internal architectures, training data, or task performances. Our method
constructs a "language model graph" that maps relationships between models from
the semantic coherence of pairwise conversations, and then applies community
detection to identify synergistic model clusters. Our experiments with diverse
LLMs demonstrate that the proposed method discovers functionally coherent
groups that reflect their latent specializations. Priming conversations with
specific topics identified synergistic teams which outperform random baselines
on downstream benchmarks and achieve comparable accuracy to that of
manually-curated teams based on known model specializations. Our findings
provide a new basis for the automated design of collaborative multi-agent LLM
teams.

Motivation: 随着生成式AI方法在科学工作流程中的使用增加，研究者希望利用语篇层面的信息为AI生成的科学主张寻找支持证据，而推断科学写作中的语篇结构是实现这一目标的第一步。

Method: 使用预训练语言模型和大语言模型方法进行语篇关系分类，特别关注科学出版物这一较少被研究的文本类型，并考察上下文（定义为语篇结构）对分类任务的帮助作用。

Result: 实验表明，基于语篇结构定义的上下文通常对语篇关系分类任务有帮助，并分析了哪些科学语篇关系类型从上下文中获益最多。

Conclusion: 上下文在科学语篇关系分类中具有重要作用，这为利用语篇信息支持AI生成科学主张的证据查找提供了基础。

Abstract: With the increasing use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods to
support science workflows, we are interested in the use of discourse-level
information to find supporting evidence for AI generated scientific claims. A
first step towards this objective is to examine the task of inferring discourse
structure in scientific writing.
  In this work, we present a preliminary investigation of pretrained language
model (PLM) and Large Language Model (LLM) approaches for Discourse Relation
Classification (DRC), focusing on scientific publications, an under-studied
genre for this task. We examine how context can help with the DRC task, with
our experiments showing that context, as defined by discourse structure, is
generally helpful. We also present an analysis of which scientific discourse
relation types might benefit most from context.

TL;DR: OmniEduBench是一个全面的中文教育基准测试，包含24.602K高质量问答对，涵盖知识维度和素养维度，共61个学科和11种题型，用于评估LLM在教育领域的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM和基准测试主要关注知识维度，忽视素养能力评估，且缺乏多样性，特别是在中文教育场景中。

Method: 构建包含24.602K问答对的综合基准，分为知识维度(18.121K)和素养维度(6.481K)，每个维度细分为6个类别，覆盖61个学科和11种题型。

Result: 在11个主流LLM上的实验显示：知识维度仅Gemini-2.5 Pro超过60%准确率；素养维度最佳模型QWQ仍比人类智能低近30%。

Conclusion: LLM在教育应用中仍有很大改进空间，OmniEduBench为全面评估LLM教育能力提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), various LLM-based
works have been widely applied in educational fields. However, most existing
LLMs and their benchmarks focus primarily on the knowledge dimension, largely
neglecting the evaluation of cultivation capabilities that are essential for
real-world educational scenarios. Additionally, current benchmarks are often
limited to a single subject or question type, lacking sufficient diversity.
This issue is particularly prominent within the Chinese context. To address
this gap, we introduce OmniEduBench, a comprehensive Chinese educational
benchmark. OmniEduBench consists of 24.602K high-quality question-answer pairs.
The data is meticulously divided into two core dimensions: the knowledge
dimension and the cultivation dimension, which contain 18.121K and 6.481K
entries, respectively. Each dimension is further subdivided into 6 fine-grained
categories, covering a total of 61 different subjects (41 in the knowledge and
20 in the cultivation). Furthermore, the dataset features a rich variety of
question formats, including 11 common exam question types, providing a solid
foundation for comprehensively evaluating LLMs' capabilities in education.
Extensive experiments on 11 mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs
reveal a clear performance gap. In the knowledge dimension, only Gemini-2.5 Pro
surpassed 60\% accuracy, while in the cultivation dimension, the
best-performing model, QWQ, still trailed human intelligence by nearly 30\%.
These results highlight the substantial room for improvement and underscore the
challenges of applying LLMs in education.

TL;DR: SSLC方法通过协同稀疏化和低秩逼近来压缩大语言模型，无需额外训练即可实现50%压缩且性能无损，达到1.63倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然表现出色，但其广泛部署受到带宽和计算需求的限制。现有剪枝和低秩逼近方法各自表现良好，但二者的协同作用尚未充分探索。

Method: 将低秩逼近和稀疏优化统一为一个问题，通过迭代优化算法求解，结合两种技术的优势：低秩逼近保留模型基本结构，稀疏优化去除非关键权重。

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen2.5模型(7B-70B)上的实验表明，SSLC无需额外训练就能超越单一方法，达到最先进结果。Qwen2.5压缩50%后性能无下降，且至少加速1.63倍。

Conclusion: SSLC为大语言模型的高效部署提供了实用解决方案，通过协同稀疏化和低秩逼近实现了显著的压缩和加速效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
language comprehension and generation; however, their widespread adoption is
constrained by substantial bandwidth and computational demands. While pruning
and low-rank approximation have each demonstrated promising performance
individually, their synergy for LLMs remains underexplored. We introduce
\underline{S}ynergistic \underline{S}parse and \underline{L}ow-Rank
\underline{C}ompression (SSLC) methods for LLMs, which leverages the strengths
of both techniques: low-rank approximation compresses the model by retaining
its essential structure with minimal information loss, whereas sparse
optimization eliminates non-essential weights, preserving those crucial for
generalization. Based on theoretical analysis, we first formulate the low-rank
approximation and sparse optimization as a unified problem and solve it by
iterative optimization algorithm. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen2.5 models
(7B-70B) show that SSLC, without any additional training steps, consistently
surpasses standalone methods, achieving state-of-the-arts results. Notably,
SSLC compresses Qwen2.5 by 50\% with no performance drop and achieves at least
1.63$\times$ speedup, offering a practical solution for efficient LLM
deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了一个贝叶斯网络LLM融合框架，通过概率机制整合三个LLM的预测结果，在情感分析任务中实现了约6%的准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有领域特定LLM存在透明度低、微调成本高、提示工程复杂、跨领域结果不一致以及高计算需求导致环境负面影响等问题。

Method: BNLF框架通过贝叶斯网络将多个LLM的情感预测建模为概率节点，进行后期融合，整合了FinBERT、RoBERTa和BERTweet三个模型的预测。

Result: 在三个具有不同语言和上下文特征的人类标注金融语料库上评估，BNLF相比基线LLM实现了约6%的准确率一致提升。

Conclusion: 该框架对数据集变异性具有鲁棒性，证明了概率融合在可解释情感分类中的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, with an increasing number
of domain-specific variants tailored for specialised tasks. However, these
models often lack transparency and explainability, can be costly to fine-tune,
require substantial prompt engineering, yield inconsistent results across
domains, and impose significant adverse environmental impact due to their high
computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose the Bayesian
network LLM fusion (BNLF) framework, which integrates predictions from three
LLMs, including FinBERT, RoBERTa, and BERTweet, through a probabilistic
mechanism for sentiment analysis. BNLF performs late fusion by modelling the
sentiment predictions from multiple LLMs as probabilistic nodes within a
Bayesian network. Evaluated across three human-annotated financial corpora with
distinct linguistic and contextual characteristics, BNLF demonstrates
consistent gains of about six percent in accuracy over the baseline LLMs,
underscoring its robustness to dataset variability and the effectiveness of
probabilistic fusion for interpretable sentiment classification.

Motivation: 确定多个LLM代理的集成能否比单一LLM提供更可靠的像素级AI分诊工具评估，以提高临床AI工具评估的准确性和一致性。

Method: 分析了29,766例非对比CT头部检查，使用8个开源LLM模型和GPT-4o通过多轮提示评估颅内出血，比较了不同模型的性能特征和集成效果。

Result: Llama3.3:70b和GPT-4o表现最佳（AUC=0.78），集成方法（Top-3、Full-9、Consensus）在MCC指标上均优于单一GPT-4o，且集成方法间无显著差异。

Conclusion: 中等至大型开源LLM集成比单一LLM提供了更一致和可靠的临床AI分诊工具回顾性评估方法。

Abstract: Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine if an ensemble of
multiple LLM agents could be used collectively to provide a more reliable
assessment of a pixel-based AI triage tool than a single LLM.
  Methods: 29,766 non-contrast CT head exams from fourteen hospitals were
processed by a commercial intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) AI detection tool.
Radiology reports were analyzed by an ensemble of eight open-source LLM models
and a HIPAA compliant internal version of GPT-4o using a single multi-shot
prompt that assessed for presence of ICH. 1,726 examples were manually
reviewed. Performance characteristics of the eight open-source models and
consensus were compared to GPT-4o. Three ideal consensus LLM ensembles were
tested for rating the performance of the triage tool.
  Results: The cohort consisted of 29,766 head CTs exam-report pairs. The
highest AUC performance was achieved with llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AUC= 0.78).
The average precision was highest for Llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AP=0.75 & 0.76).
Llama3.3:70b had the highest F1 score (0.81) and recall (0.85), greater
precision (0.78), specificity (0.72), and MCC (0.57). Using MCC (95% CI) the
ideal combination of LLMs were: Full-9 Ensemble 0.571 (0.552-0.591), Top-3
Ensemble 0.558 (0.537-0.579), Consensus 0.556 (0.539-0.574), and GPT4o 0.522
(0.500-0.543). No statistically significant differences were observed between
Top-3, Full-9, and Consensus (p > 0.05).
  Conclusion: An ensemble of medium to large sized open-source LLMs provides a
more consistent and reliable method to derive a ground truth retrospective
evaluation of a clinical AI triage tool over a single LLM alone.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希伯来语变音符号恢复对于确保准确发音和消除文本歧义至关重要，尽管未变音文本存在高度歧义性，但机器学习方法已显著提升该任务性能。

Method: 将任务构建为词级零样本分类问题，从动态生成的候选集中选择最合适的变音模式，使用希伯来视觉语言模型将未变音文本作为图像处理，使变音信息直接嵌入输入向量表示。

Result: 在"oracle"设置下（正确变音形式保证在候选集中），系统达到高准确率；通过架构增强和优化训练方法显著提升系统泛化能力。

Conclusion: 视觉表示在准确自动化希伯来语变音符号恢复方面具有巨大潜力，系统无需依赖复杂显式语言分析即可有效执行变音任务。

Abstract: Diacritics restoration in Hebrew is a fundamental task for ensuring accurate
word pronunciation and disambiguating textual meaning. Despite the language's
high degree of ambiguity when unvocalized, recent machine learning approaches
have significantly advanced performance on this task.
  In this work, we present DIVRIT, a novel system for Hebrew diacritization
that frames the task as a zero-shot classification problem. Our approach
operates at the word level, selecting the most appropriate diacritization
pattern for each undiacritized word from a dynamically generated candidate set,
conditioned on the surrounding textual context. A key innovation of DIVRIT is
its use of a Hebrew Visual Language Model, which processes undiacritized text
as an image, allowing diacritic information to be embedded directly within the
input's vector representation.
  Through a comprehensive evaluation across various configurations, we
demonstrate that the system effectively performs diacritization without relying
on complex, explicit linguistic analysis. Notably, in an ``oracle'' setting
where the correct diacritized form is guaranteed to be among the provided
candidates, DIVRIT achieves a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, strategic
architectural enhancements and optimized training methodologies yield
significant improvements in the system's overall generalization capabilities.
These findings highlight the promising potential of visual representations for
accurate and automated Hebrew diacritization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展Hernandez等人[2023]的单关系发现到关系集合，系统分析其组织结构，解释线性关系解码器的可压缩性和泛化行为。

Method: 使用简单的三阶张量网络压缩关系解码器集合，开发交叉评估协议分析解码器在不同关系间的适用性。

Result: 关系解码器集合可被高度压缩而不损失精度，解码器提取的是重复的语义属性而非特定关系，解释了其压缩性和泛化限制。

Conclusion: Transformer语言模型中的线性关系解码本质上是基于属性的，而非关系特定的，这解释了其压缩性和语义相近关系的泛化能力。

Abstract: This paper investigates the structure of linear operators introduced in
Hernandez et al. [2023] that decode specific relational facts in transformer
language models. We extend their single-relation findings to a collection of
relations and systematically chart their organization. We show that such
collections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3
tensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this
surprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we
apply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our
results reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but
extract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital
city and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This
property-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and
highlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically
close. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer
language models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific.

Motivation: 在深度搜索场景中，强化学习的应用受到低奖励密度的阻碍，智能体需要付出大量探索成本却只能获得稀疏的最终奖励。

Method: 1) 子问题分解：将长程任务分解以分配过程奖励；2) 失败引导提示：向停滞轨迹注入纠正指导；3) 双智能体精炼：使用双智能体架构减轻深度探索的认知负担。

Result: 在多个智能体搜索基准测试中，InfoFlow显著优于强基线方法，使轻量级LLM能够达到与高级专有LLM相当的性能。

Conclusion: InfoFlow通过提高奖励密度有效解决了深度搜索中强化学习的应用障碍，为轻量级模型提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for enhancing agentic deep search. However, its application is often hindered
by low \textbf{Reward Density} in deep search scenarios, where agents expend
significant exploratory costs for infrequent and often null final rewards. In
this paper, we formalize this challenge as the \textbf{Reward Density
Optimization} problem, which aims to improve the reward obtained per unit of
exploration cost. This paper introduce \textbf{InfoFlow}, a systematic
framework that tackles this problem from three aspects. 1) \textbf{Subproblem
decomposition}: breaking down long-range tasks to assign process rewards,
thereby providing denser learning signals. 2) \textbf{Failure-guided hints}:
injecting corrective guidance into stalled trajectories to increase the
probability of successful outcomes. 3) \textbf{Dual-agent refinement}:
employing a dual-agent architecture to offload the cognitive burden of deep
exploration. A refiner agent synthesizes the search history, which effectively
compresses the researcher's perceived trajectory, thereby reducing exploration
cost and increasing the overall reward density. We evaluate InfoFlow on
multiple agentic search benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms strong
baselines, enabling lightweight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to
advanced proprietary LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型面临自回归设计和庞大尺寸带来的显著推理延迟问题，而现有的推测解码方法如EAGLE-2和EAGLE-3虽然使用动态树结构，但往往忽略了GPU设备和批量大小等关键系统变量的影响。

Method: 提出CAST动态树解码方法，综合考虑推理成本（包括GPU配置和批量大小等因素），动态优化树结构。

Result: 在六个不同任务和六个不同LLM上的综合实验显示，该方法比传统解码方法速度提升高达5.2倍，通常比现有最先进技术提升5-20%。

Conclusion: CAST方法通过考虑系统变量动态优化树结构，显著提升了大型语言模型的推理效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant inference latency challenges
stemming from their autoregressive design and large size. To address this,
speculative decoding emerges as a solution, enabling the simultaneous
generation and validation of multiple tokens. While recent approaches like
EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3 improve speculative decoding using dynamic tree structures,
they often neglect the impact of crucial system variables such as GPU devices
and batch sizes.
  Therefore, we introduce a new dynamic tree decoding approach called CAST that
takes into account inference costs, including factors such as GPU
configurations and batch sizes, to dynamically refine the tree structure.
Through comprehensive experimentation across six diverse tasks and utilizing
six distinct LLMs, our methodology demonstrates remarkable results, achieving
speeds up to 5.2 times faster than conventional decoding methods. Moreover, it
generally outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques from 5% to 20%.

*Yiqiao Jin,Rachneet Kaur,Zhen Zeng,Sumitra Ganesh,Srijan Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SlideAgent是一个用于理解多模态、多页面、多布局文档（特别是幻灯片）的代理框架，通过三级专业化代理（全局、页面、元素）实现细粒度推理，显著优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前系统在处理复杂的多页面视觉文档时存在困难，特别是在元素和页面级别的细粒度推理方面。大型语言模型在文档理解方面提供了机会，但需要更好的方法来处理这类文档。

Method: 采用专业化代理框架，将推理分解为三个层级：全局、页面和元素，构建结构化的、查询无关的表示，在推理时选择性激活专业化代理进行多级推理并整合输出。

Result: 在广泛实验中，SlideAgent相比专有模型整体提升7.9%，相比开源模型整体提升9.8%。

Conclusion: SlideAgent框架能够有效理解多模态、多页面、多布局文档，通过多级专业化代理实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Multi-page visual documents such as manuals, brochures, presentations, and
posters convey key information through layout, colors, icons, and cross-slide
references. While large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities in document
understanding, current systems struggle with complex, multi-page visual
documents, particularly in fine-grained reasoning over elements and pages. We
introduce SlideAgent, a versatile agentic framework for understanding
multi-modal, multi-page, and multi-layout documents, especially slide decks.
SlideAgent employs specialized agents and decomposes reasoning into three
specialized levels-global, page, and element-to construct a structured,
query-agnostic representation that captures both overarching themes and
detailed visual or textual cues. During inference, SlideAgent selectively
activates specialized agents for multi-level reasoning and integrates their
outputs into coherent, context-aware answers. Extensive experiments show that
SlideAgent achieves significant improvement over both proprietary (+7.9
overall) and open-source models (+9.8 overall).

*Biao Zhang,Yong Cheng,Siamak Shakeri,Xinyi Wang,Min Ma,Orhan Firat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文重新审视编码器-解码器架构的LLM（RedLLM），与当前主流的仅解码器架构（DecLLM）进行全面的缩放对比分析，发现RedLLM具有出色的缩放特性和性能表现，在指令调优后能在保持推理效率的同时达到甚至超越DecLLM的下游任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM研究快速从编码器-解码器架构转向仅解码器架构，但缺乏从缩放角度的严谨对比分析，可能导致编码器-解码器模型的潜力被忽视。

Method: 使用前缀语言建模预训练RedLLM，与使用因果语言建模预训练的DecLLM进行比较，模型规模从1.5亿到80亿参数，使用RedPajama V1（1.6T tokens）进行预训练，FLAN进行指令调优。

Result: RedLLM展现出令人信服的缩放特性和强大性能，虽然DecLLM在预训练阶段计算效率更高，但RedLLM具有可比的缩放和上下文长度外推能力。指令调优后，RedLLM在各种下游任务上达到可比甚至更好的结果，同时推理效率显著更高。

Conclusion: 编码器-解码器架构的LLM具有巨大潜力，值得重新审视，为开发强大且高效的LLM提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Recent large language model (LLM) research has undergone an architectural
shift from encoder-decoder modeling to nowadays the dominant decoder-only
modeling. This rapid transition, however, comes without a rigorous comparative
analysis especially \textit{from the scaling perspective}, raising concerns
that the potential of encoder-decoder models may have been overlooked. To fill
this gap, we revisit encoder-decoder LLM (RedLLM), enhancing it with recent
recipes from decoder-only LLM (DecLLM). We conduct a comprehensive comparison
between RedLLM, pretrained with prefix language modeling (LM), and DecLLM,
pretrained with causal LM, at different model scales, ranging from $\sim$150M
to $\sim$8B. Using RedPajama V1 (1.6T tokens) for pretraining and FLAN for
instruction tuning, our experiments show that RedLLM produces compelling
scaling properties and surprisingly strong performance. While DecLLM is overall
more compute-optimal during pretraining, RedLLM demonstrates comparable scaling
and context length extrapolation capabilities. After instruction tuning, RedLLM
achieves comparable and even better results on various downstream tasks while
enjoying substantially better inference efficiency. We hope our findings could
inspire more efforts on re-examining RedLLM, unlocking its potential for
developing powerful and efficient LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evontree是一个利用少量高质量本体规则来系统提取、验证和增强LLMs领域知识的新框架，无需大量外部数据集，在医疗QA基准测试中表现优于未修改模型和领先监督基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗等数据敏感领域，缺乏高质量领域特定训练语料阻碍了LLMs的专业应用，而领域专家已将领域智慧提炼成本体规则。

Method: Evontree从原始模型中提取领域本体，使用两个核心本体规则检测不一致性，并通过自蒸馏微调强化精炼后的知识。

Result: 在Llama3-8B-Instruct和Med42-v2上的医疗QA基准测试中，相比未修改模型和领先监督基线，准确率提升了最高3.7%。

Conclusion: 该方法在LLMs的低资源领域适应中表现出有效性、高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities
across multiple domains by leveraging massive pre-training and curated
fine-tuning data. However, in data-sensitive fields such as healthcare, the
lack of high-quality, domain-specific training corpus hinders LLMs' adaptation
for specialized applications. Meanwhile, domain experts have distilled domain
wisdom into ontology rules, which formalize relationships among concepts and
ensure the integrity of knowledge management repositories. Viewing LLMs as
implicit repositories of human knowledge, we propose Evontree, a novel
framework that leverages a small set of high-quality ontology rules to
systematically extract, validate, and enhance domain knowledge within LLMs,
without requiring extensive external datasets. Specifically, Evontree extracts
domain ontology from raw models, detects inconsistencies using two core
ontology rules, and reinforces the refined knowledge via self-distilled
fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on medical QA benchmarks with
Llama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2 demonstrate consistent outperformance over both
unmodified models and leading supervised baselines, achieving up to a 3.7%
improvement in accuracy. These results confirm the effectiveness, efficiency,
and robustness of our approach for low-resource domain adaptation of LLMs.

TL;DR: Kimi Linear是一种混合线性注意力架构，首次在公平比较下超越全注意力机制，在短上下文、长上下文和强化学习场景中表现优异。核心是Kimi Delta Attention (KDA)，通过精细门控机制扩展Gated DeltaNet，有效利用有限RNN内存。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统注意力机制在长序列处理中的计算和内存瓶颈，同时保持或提升模型性能。

Method: 采用KDA模块和定制分块算法，使用Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)转换矩阵变体减少计算量，结合KDA和Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA)的层间混合架构。

Result: 3B激活参数的Kimi Linear模型在所有评估任务中显著优于全MLA，KV缓存使用减少75%，1M上下文解码吞吐量提升6倍。

Conclusion: Kimi Linear可作为全注意力架构的直接替代方案，在性能和效率上均表现优越，特别适用于长输入输出任务。

Abstract: We introduce Kimi Linear, a hybrid linear attention architecture that, for
the first time, outperforms full attention under fair comparisons across
various scenarios -- including short-context, long-context, and reinforcement
learning (RL) scaling regimes. At its core lies Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), an
expressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with a
finer-grained gating mechanism, enabling more effective use of limited
finite-state RNN memory. Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware
efficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)
transition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the
general DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical
delta rule.
  We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total
parameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention
(MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear
outperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while
reducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding
throughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be
a drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior
performance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output
lengths.
  To support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM
implementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model
checkpoints.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoDeco是一个新颖的架构，通过在标准transformer上添加轻量级头部，实现真正的端到端生成，让模型能够动态预测上下文特定的温度值和top-p值，从而控制自身的解码策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM的"端到端"标签存在误导性，实际依赖非可微的解码过程，需要手动调整温度、top-p等超参数，这过程繁琐且需要大量人工调优。

Method: 在标准transformer架构上增加轻量级头部，在每个生成步骤中动态预测上下文特定的温度值和top-p值，同时预测下一个token的对数概率，将解码转变为参数化的token级过程。

Result: 在八个基准测试上的实验表明，AutoDeco不仅显著优于默认解码策略，而且性能接近通过"黑客测试集"获得的oracle调优基线。模型还展现出基于指令的解码控制能力，能够理解自然语言指令并相应调整温度值和top-p。

Conclusion: AutoDeco开创了可引导和交互式LLM解码的新范式，通过让模型学习控制自身的解码策略，实现了真正的端到端生成，并展示了基于自然语言指令的解码控制能力。

Abstract: The "end-to-end" label for LLMs is a misnomer. In practice, they depend on a
non-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of
hyperparameters like temperature and top-p. This paper introduces AutoDeco, a
novel architecture that enables truly "end-to-end" generation by learning to
control its own decoding strategy. We augment the standard transformer with
lightweight heads that, at each step, dynamically predict context-specific
temperature and top-p values alongside the next-token logits. This approach
transforms decoding into a parametric, token-level process, allowing the model
to self-regulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass.
  Through extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, we demonstrate that
AutoDeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but
also achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline derived from
"hacking the test set"-a practical upper bound for any static method.
Crucially, we uncover an emergent capability for instruction-based decoding
control: the model learns to interpret natural language commands (e.g.,
"generate with low randomness") and adjusts its predicted temperature and top-p
on a token-by-token basis, opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactive
LLM decoding.

TL;DR: 研究大语言模型在训练过程中如何学习人类价值观对齐，发现监督微调阶段主要确立模型价值观，后续偏好优化很少重新对齐价值观。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注已训练模型的价值观对齐，忽略了训练动态过程。需要了解模型在训练过程中何时以及如何学习价值观对齐。

Method: 使用Llama-3和Qwen-3不同规模模型，结合流行的监督微调和偏好优化数据集与算法，分析价值观漂移的幅度和时间。使用合成偏好数据集进行受控实验。

Result: 监督微调阶段通常确立模型的价值观，后续偏好优化很少重新对齐这些价值观。不同偏好优化算法即使使用相同偏好数据也会导致不同的价值观对齐结果。

Conclusion: 研究结果提供了关于价值观在训练过程中如何学习的可操作见解，有助于指导数据筛选、模型选择以及偏好优化算法选择，以改善模型与人类价值观的对齐。

Abstract: As LLMs occupy an increasingly important role in society, they are more and
more confronted with questions that require them not only to draw on their
general knowledge but also to align with certain human value systems.
Therefore, studying the alignment of LLMs with human values has become a
crucial field of inquiry. Prior work, however, mostly focuses on evaluating the
alignment of fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics by which
models learn to express human values. In this work, we investigate how and at
which stage value alignment arises during the course of a model's
post-training. Our analysis disentangles the effects of post-training
algorithms and datasets, measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts
during training. Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different
sizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization
datasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a
model's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these
values. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables
controlled manipulation of values, we find that different preference
optimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when
preference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into
how values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation,
as well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization
to improve model alignment to human values.

TL;DR: AMO-Bench是一个高级数学推理基准，包含50道奥林匹克竞赛难度或更高的人类编写问题，旨在评估大型语言模型的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学竞赛基准由于性能饱和（如AIME24/25）对顶级LLM的评估效果下降，需要更严格的挑战来推动数学推理能力的进步。

Method: 创建50道经过专家交叉验证、达到IMO难度标准的原创问题，仅需最终答案而非证明，支持自动评分。

Result: 在26个LLM上的实验显示，最佳模型准确率仅为52.4%，大多数模型低于40%，但发现了测试时计算增加的扩展趋势。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在数学推理方面仍有显著改进空间，AMO-Bench的发布将促进语言模型推理能力的进一步研究。

Abstract: We present AMO-Bench, an Advanced Mathematical reasoning benchmark with
Olympiad level or even higher difficulty, comprising 50 human-crafted problems.
Existing benchmarks have widely leveraged high school math competitions for
evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, many existing math competitions are becoming less effective for
assessing top-tier LLMs due to performance saturation (e.g., AIME24/25). To
address this, AMO-Bench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all 50
problems are (1) cross-validated by experts to meet at least the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) difficulty standards, and (2) entirely original
problems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization.
Moreover, each problem in AMO-Bench requires only a final answer rather than a
proof, enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation. Experimental
results across 26 LLMs on AMO-Bench show that even the best-performing model
achieves only 52.4% accuracy on AMO-Bench, with most LLMs scoring below 40%.
Beyond these poor performances, our further analysis reveals a promising
scaling trend with increasing test-time compute on AMO-Bench. These results
highlight the significant room for improving the mathematical reasoning in
current LLMs. We release AMO-Bench to facilitate further research into
advancing the reasoning abilities of language models.

Motivation: 随着编码代理在大型代码库中的部署增加，需要自动设计具有挑战性的代码库级评估任务来测试其能力。

Method: 提出Gistify任务：给编码LLM完整代码库访问权限和特定入口点，要求生成最小化独立文件来复现相同命令的输出。

Result: 当前最先进的模型在可靠解决Gistify任务方面存在困难，特别是对于执行轨迹较长的任务。

Conclusion: Gistify任务有效评估了编码LLM的结构理解、执行流建模和大代码补丁生成能力，揭示了现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: As coding agents are increasingly deployed in large codebases, the need to
automatically design challenging, codebase-level evaluation is central. We
propose Gistify, a task where a coding LLM must create a single, minimal,
self-contained file that can reproduce a specific functionality of a codebase.
The coding LLM is given full access to a codebase along with a specific
entrypoint (e.g., a python command), and the generated file must replicate the
output of the same command ran under the full codebase, while containing only
the essential components necessary to execute the provided command. Success on
Gistify requires both structural understanding of the codebase, accurate
modeling of its execution flow as well as the ability to produce potentially
large code patches. Our findings show that current state-of-the-art models
struggle to reliably solve Gistify tasks, especially ones with long executions
traces.

Result: 公开数据集测试显示推荐系统普遍改进，但隐藏测试结果揭示了现有方法在大规模网页推荐中的局限性，LLM集成显示出改进潜力。

Conclusion: ORBIT基准测试平台为推荐系统研究提供了统一、现实的评估环境，揭示了现有方法的局限性并指出了LLM集成的改进方向。

Abstract: Recommender systems are among the most impactful AI applications, interacting
with billions of users every day, guiding them to relevant products, services,
or information tailored to their preferences. However, the research and
development of recommender systems are hindered by existing datasets that fail
to capture realistic user behaviors and inconsistent evaluation settings that
lead to ambiguous conclusions. This paper introduces the Open Recommendation
Benchmark for Reproducible Research with HIdden Tests (ORBIT), a unified
benchmark for consistent and realistic evaluation of recommendation models.
ORBIT offers a standardized evaluation framework of public datasets with
reproducible splits and transparent settings for its public leaderboard.
Additionally, ORBIT introduces a new webpage recommendation task, ClueWeb-Reco,
featuring web browsing sequences from 87 million public, high-quality webpages.
ClueWeb-Reco is a synthetic dataset derived from real, user-consented, and
privacy-guaranteed browsing data. It aligns with modern recommendation
scenarios and is reserved as the hidden test part of our leaderboard to
challenge recommendation models' generalization ability. ORBIT measures 12
representative recommendation models on its public benchmark and introduces a
prompted LLM baseline on the ClueWeb-Reco hidden test. Our benchmark results
reflect general improvements of recommender systems on the public datasets,
with variable individual performances. The results on the hidden test reveal
the limitations of existing approaches in large-scale webpage recommendation
and highlight the potential for improvements with LLM integrations. ORBIT

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推荐系统中，特征交互模块和用户行为序列模块通常独立发展，阻碍了双向信息交换和统一优化扩展。

Method: 使用统一分词器将顺序和非顺序属性转换为单一令牌序列，通过堆叠的OneTrans块共享顺序令牌参数并为非顺序令牌分配特定参数，采用因果注意力和跨请求KV缓存。

Result: 在工业规模数据集上，OneTrans随着参数增加高效扩展，持续优于强基线，在线A/B测试中实现人均GMV提升5.68%。

Conclusion: OneTrans成功统一了序列建模和特征交互，实现了高效扩展和性能提升。

Abstract: In recommendation systems, scaling up feature-interaction modules (e.g.,
Wukong, RankMixer) or user-behavior sequence modules (e.g., LONGER) has
achieved notable success. However, these efforts typically proceed on separate
tracks, which not only hinders bidirectional information exchange but also
prevents unified optimization and scaling. In this paper, we propose OneTrans,
a unified Transformer backbone that simultaneously performs user-behavior
sequence modeling and feature interaction. OneTrans employs a unified tokenizer
to convert both sequential and non-sequential attributes into a single token
sequence. The stacked OneTrans blocks share parameters across similar
sequential tokens while assigning token-specific parameters to non-sequential
tokens. Through causal attention and cross-request KV caching, OneTrans enables
precomputation and caching of intermediate representations, significantly
reducing computational costs during both training and inference. Experimental
results on industrial-scale datasets demonstrate that OneTrans scales
efficiently with increasing parameters, consistently outperforms strong
baselines, and yields a 5.68% lift in per-user GMV in online A/B tests.

Conclusion: 将法律推理融入法律案例检索系统具有巨大潜力，ReaKase-8B框架为法律案例检索提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: Legal case retrieval (LCR) is a cornerstone of real-world legal decision
making, as it enables practitioners to identify precedents for a given query
case. Existing approaches mainly rely on traditional lexical models and
pretrained language models to encode the texts of legal cases. Yet there are
rich information in the relations among different legal entities as well as the
crucial reasoning process that uncovers how legal facts and legal issues can
lead to judicial decisions. Such relational reasoning process reflects the
distinctive characteristics of each case that can distinguish one from another,
mirroring the real-world judicial process. Naturally, incorporating such
information into the precise case embedding could further enhance the accuracy
of case retrieval. In this paper, a novel ReaKase-8B framework is proposed to
leverage extracted legal facts, legal issues, legal relation triplets and legal
reasoning for effective legal case retrieval. ReaKase-8B designs an in-context
legal case representation learning paradigm with a fine-tuned large language
model. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets from COLIEE 2022 and
COLIEE 2023 demonstrate that our knowledge and reasoning augmented embeddings
substantially improve retrieval performance over baseline models, highlighting
the potential of integrating legal reasoning into legal case retrieval systems.

Abstract: Automatic structure elucidation is essential for self-driving laboratories as
it enables the system to achieve truly autonomous. This capability closes the

Herein, we present DiSE, an end-to-end diffusion-based generative model that

data-driven approaches, DiSE achieves superior accuracy, strong generalization
across chemically diverse datasets, and robustness to experimental data despite
being trained on calculated spectra. DiSE thus represents a significant advance
toward fully automated structure elucidation, with broad potential in natural
product research, drug discovery, and self-driving laboratories.

*Danial Ebrat,Sepideh Ahmadian,Luis Rueda*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图注意力网络的协同过滤框架，通过LLM增强的上下文感知嵌入来解决推荐系统中的数据稀疏和冷启动问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统在数据稀疏和冷启动场景下表现不佳，难以为新用户或不活跃用户提供准确推荐。

Method: 使用LLM生成用户简档和统一物品元数据作为图节点特征，在二分用户-物品图中应用图注意力网络，并采用结合BPR和余弦相似度的混合损失函数。

Result: 在MovieLens数据集上的实验显示，在Precision、NDCG和MAP指标上均优于现有方法，对交互历史有限的用户表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过将LLM衍生的上下文理解整合到图架构中，有效缓解了稀疏性和冷启动限制，未来可进一步平衡准确性、覆盖率和多样性。

Abstract: Recommender systems often struggle with data sparsity and cold-start
scenarios, limiting their ability to provide accurate suggestions for new or
infrequent users. This paper presents a Graph Attention Network (GAT) based
Collaborative Filtering (CF) framework enhanced with Large Language Model (LLM)
driven context aware embeddings. Specifically, we generate concise textual user
profiles and unify item metadata (titles, genres, overviews) into rich textual
embeddings, injecting these as initial node features in a bipartite user item
graph. To further optimize ranking performance, we introduce a hybrid loss
function that combines Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) with a cosine
similarity term and robust negative sampling, ensuring explicit negative
feedback is distinguished from unobserved data. Experiments on the MovieLens
100k and 1M datasets show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art
baselines in Precision, NDCG, and MAP while demonstrating robustness for users
with limited interaction history. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of
LLM-augmented embeddings and the cosine similarity term in capturing nuanced
semantic relationships. Our approach effectively mitigates sparsity and
cold-start limitations by integrating LLM-derived contextual understanding into
graph-based architectures. Future directions include balancing recommendation
accuracy with coverage and diversity, and introducing fairness-aware
constraints and interpretability features to enhance system performance
further.

*Min Hou,Xin Liu,Le Wu,Chenyi He,Hao Liu,Zhi Li,Xin Li,Si Wei*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了WeaveRec方法，通过交叉训练多个LoRA模块并以编织方式融合，解决了LLM在跨域推荐中性能下降的问题，无需重叠用户或物品即可实现知识迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨域顺序推荐方法依赖重叠用户或物品来建立跨域关联，这在现实场景中很少满足。虽然LLM和模型融合技术看似能克服这一限制，但实证研究表明，在组合域上训练LLM或简单融合多个域特定LLM往往会导致性能下降。

Method: WeaveRec方法交叉训练多个LoRA模块，使用源域和目标域数据以编织方式进行训练，并通过模型融合将它们合并。该方法可扩展到多源域场景，且不会增加推理时的延迟或内存成本。

Result: 在单源、多源和跨平台跨域推荐场景上的大量实验验证了WeaveRec能有效缓解性能下降，并在实际推荐任务中持续优于基线方法。

Conclusion: WeaveRec通过理论保证可以降低目标域预期误差的上界，为LLM在跨域推荐中的应用提供了有效解决方案，无需依赖重叠用户或物品即可实现知识迁移。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) seeks to improve user
preference modeling by transferring knowledge from multiple domains. Despite
the progress made in CDSR, most existing methods rely on overlapping users or
items to establish cross-domain correlations-a requirement that rarely holds in
real-world settings. The advent of large language models (LLM) and
model-merging techniques appears to overcome this limitation by unifying
multi-domain data without explicit overlaps. Yet, our empirical study shows
that naively training an LLM on combined domains-or simply merging several
domain-specific LLMs-often degrades performance relative to a model trained
solely on the target domain. To address these challenges, we first
experimentally investigate the cause of suboptimal performance in LLM-based
cross-domain recommendation and model merging. Building on these insights, we
introduce WeaveRec, which cross-trains multiple LoRA modules with source and
target domain data in a weaving fashion, and fuses them via model merging.
WeaveRec can be extended to multi-source domain scenarios and notably does not
introduce additional inference-time cost in terms of latency or memory.
Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee that WeaveRec can reduce the
upper bound of the expected error in the target domain. Extensive experiments
on single-source, multi-source, and cross-platform cross-domain recommendation
scenarios validate that WeaveRec effectively mitigates performance degradation
and consistently outperforms baseline approaches in real-world recommendation
tasks.

### [137] [Towards Piece-by-Piece Explanations for Chess Positions with SHAP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25775)
*Francesco Spinnato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 将SHAP解释性AI技术应用于国际象棋分析，通过系统性地移除棋盘上的棋子来计算每个棋子对引擎评估的贡献值，使引擎评估更加透明和可解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前国际象棋引擎提供精确但不透明的评估分数（通常以百分兵为单位），这些输出掩盖了单个棋子或模式的具体贡献，需要一种方法来解释引擎评估背后的具体原因。

Method: 将棋盘上的棋子视为特征，通过系统性地移除（消融）棋子，使用SHAP技术计算每个棋子的加性贡献值，从而在局部忠实且人类可解释的方式下解释引擎的输出。

Result: 开发了一种能够将国际象棋引擎评估归因于特定棋子的方法，该方法受到传统国际象棋教学（玩家通过心理移除棋子来评估局面）的启发，并基于现代可解释AI技术。

Conclusion: 该方法为可视化、人类训练和引擎比较开辟了新的可能性，并发布了配套代码和数据以促进可解释国际象棋AI的未来研究。

Abstract: Contemporary chess engines offer precise yet opaque evaluations, typically
expressed as centipawn scores. While effective for decision-making, these
outputs obscure the underlying contributions of individual pieces or patterns.
In this paper, we explore adapting SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to the
domain of chess analysis, aiming to attribute a chess engines evaluation to
specific pieces on the board. By treating pieces as features and systematically
ablating them, we compute additive, per-piece contributions that explain the
engines output in a locally faithful and human-interpretable manner. This
method draws inspiration from classical chess pedagogy, where players assess
positions by mentally removing pieces, and grounds it in modern explainable AI
techniques. Our approach opens new possibilities for visualization, human
training, and engine comparison. We release accompanying code and data to
foster future research in interpretable chess AI.

### [138] [Unveiling Intrinsic Text Bias in Multimodal Large Language Models through Attention Key-Space Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26721)
*Xinhan Zheng,Huyu Wu,Xueting Wang,Haiyun Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现多模态大语言模型存在文本偏好问题，其根源在于视觉键向量与文本键空间分布不匹配，导致视觉信息在注意力计算中被低估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理视觉语言数据时表现出明显的文本偏好，限制了其基于视觉证据的推理能力。现有研究将此归因于外部因素如数据不平衡，但本文认为偏见的根源在于模型内部架构。

Method: 从LLaVA和Qwen2.5-VL模型中提取键向量，使用t-SNE可视化和Jensen-Shannon散度分析视觉和文本键向量的分布结构。

Result: 视觉键向量和文本键向量在注意力空间中占据明显不同的子空间，模态间差异在统计上显著，超过模态内差异数个数量级。

Conclusion: 文本偏见源于注意力键空间内部的本征错位，而不仅仅是外部数据因素。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a pronounced preference for
textual inputs when processing vision-language data, limiting their ability to
reason effectively from visual evidence. Unlike prior studies that attribute
this text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction
tuning, we propose that the bias originates from the model's internal
architecture. Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (Visual
Keys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learned
during language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receive
systematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading to
their under-utilization in the context representation. To validate this
hypothesis, we extract key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL and analyze their
distributional structures using qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative
(Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods. The results provide direct evidence that
visual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attention
space. The inter-modal divergence is statistically significant, exceeding
intra-modal variation by several orders of magnitude. These findings reveal
that text bias arises from an intrinsic misalignment within the attention key
space rather than solely from external data factors.

TL;DR: 研究比较了高约束和低约束提示在基于GPT-4o的侦探游戏中的效果，发现约束程度对玩家体验无显著差异，并提出了符号化支架游戏框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨约束提示是否能真正改善玩家体验，特别是针对LLM驱动的非玩家角色对话系统。

Method: 通过用户研究比较高约束和低约束提示，然后设计混合JSON+RAG支架进行合成评估，使用LLM作为评判者。

Result: 约束效果具有角色依赖性：采访者NPC获得稳定性，但嫌疑犯NPC失去即兴可信度；推翻约束越紧游戏越好的假设。

Conclusion: 提出了符号化支架游戏框架，使用模糊数值边界来在需要时稳定连贯性，同时保留即兴发挥以维持参与度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to transform interactive games by
enabling non-player characters (NPCs) to sustain unscripted dialogue. Yet it
remains unclear whether constrained prompts actually improve player experience.
We investigate this question through The Interview, a voice-based detective
game powered by GPT-4o. A within-subjects usability study ($N=10$) compared
high-constraint (HCP) and low-constraint (LCP) prompts, revealing no reliable
experiential differences beyond sensitivity to technical breakdowns. Guided by
these findings, we redesigned the HCP into a hybrid JSON+RAG scaffold and
conducted a synthetic evaluation with an LLM judge, positioned as an
early-stage complement to usability testing. Results uncovered a novel pattern:
scaffolding effects were role-dependent: the Interviewer (quest-giver NPC)
gained stability, while suspect NPCs lost improvisational believability. These
findings overturn the assumption that tighter constraints inherently enhance
play. Extending fuzzy-symbolic scaffolding, we introduce \textit{Symbolically
Scaffolded Play}, a framework in which symbolic structures are expressed as
fuzzy, numerical boundaries that stabilize coherence where needed while
preserving improvisation where surprise sustains engagement.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种人-LLM协作框架，从仅标签标注中推断思维轨迹，通过拒绝采样方法重建这些轨迹，并应用于微调开放LLM评分器和合成更清晰的标注指南，显著提高了LLM与人类的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs越来越多地用于评估任务，但在主观任务中的可靠性有限，因为人类判断涉及超越标注标签的细微推理。思维轨迹虽然信息丰富但难以收集和整理。

Method: 使用人-LLM协作框架和简单有效的拒绝采样方法，从仅标签标注中推断思维轨迹，并将这些轨迹应用于微调开放LLM评分器和合成更清晰的标注指南。

Result: 在多个数据集上，该方法显著提高了LLM与人类的一致性，精炼的标注指南还增加了不同LLM模型之间的一致性。

Conclusion: LLMs可以作为人类思维轨迹的实际代理，使仅标签语料库能够扩展为思维轨迹增强资源，从而提高LLM评分器的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as raters for evaluation
tasks. However, their reliability is often limited for subjective tasks, when
human judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond annotation labels. Thinking
traces, the reasoning behind a judgment, are highly informative but challenging
to collect and curate. We present a human-LLM collaborative framework to infer
thinking traces from label-only annotations. The proposed framework uses a
simple and effective rejection sampling method to reconstruct these traces at
scale. These inferred thinking traces are applied to two complementary tasks:
(1) fine-tuning open LLM raters; and (2) synthesizing clearer annotation
guidelines for proprietary LLM raters. Across multiple datasets, our methods
lead to significantly improved LLM-human agreement. Additionally, the refined
annotation guidelines increase agreement among different LLM models. These
results suggest that LLMs can serve as practical proxies for otherwise
unrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only corpora to be extended
into thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance the reliability of LLM
raters.

*Nissan Yaron,Dan Bystritsky,Ben-Etzion Yaron*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 一个3.8B参数的模型Humans-Junior在FACTS Grounding公共子集上达到与GPT-4o相当的性能（在±5%等价范围内），云服务成本比GPT-4o低约19倍，自托管/边缘部署可接近零边际成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发成本效益高的小型语言模型，在保持与大型模型相当性能的同时大幅降低部署成本。

Method: 结合最小化定向"外骨骼推理"支架和行为微调，教导协议遵守而非领域知识。两者结合产生协同效应，提升性能17.7个百分点并减少约25%的方差。

Result: 在Q1-Q500测试中，GPT-4o得分73.5%，Humans-Junior得分72.7%，配对差异0.8个百分点，在±5%范围内证明等价性。在仅提示设置下，定向推理使GPT-4o提升11.8个百分点至85.3%，Gemini-2.5-Pro提升5.0个百分点至93.3%。

Conclusion: 通过定向推理支架和行为微调的组合方法，小型模型可以在特定任务上达到与大型前沿模型相当的性能，同时显著降低成本，为成本高效的AI部署提供可行方案。

Abstract: We introduce Humans-Junior, a 3.8B model that matches GPT-4o on the FACTS
Grounding public subset within a $\pm 5$ pp equivalence margin.
  Results. On Q1--Q500 under identical judges, GPT-4o scores 73.5% (95% CI
69.5--77.2) and Humans-Junior 72.7% (95% CI 68.7--76.5); the paired difference
is 0.8 pp (bootstrap 95% CI $-3.1$ to $+4.7$; permutation $p = 0.72$; Cohen's
$d = 0.023$). TOST establishes equivalence at $\pm 5$ pp (not at $\pm 3$ pp).
When purchased as managed APIs, Humans-Junior's base model
(Phi-3.5-mini-instruct) is $\approx 19\times$ less expensive than GPT-4o on
Microsoft AI Foundry pricing; self-hosted or edge deployments can drive
incremental inference cost toward zero. Measured vs estimated pricing sources
are tabulated in Appendix E.
  Method. Our approach combines minimal directed "Exoskeleton Reasoning"
scaffolds with behavioral fine-tuning that teaches protocol compliance
(epistemic discipline) rather than domain answers. Fine-tuning alone adds
little; combined, they synergize (+17.7 pp, $p < 0.001$) and reduce variance
($\approx 25\%$). In prompt-only settings on frontier models (Q1--Q100;
non-comparable), directed reasoning improved GPT-4o by +11.8 pp to 85.3% and
Gemini-2.5-Pro by +5.0 pp to 93.3% (baseline 88.3%, $n = 100$); see Section~5.
  TL;DR. A 3.8B model achieves GPT-4o-level FACTS accuracy (equivalent within
$\pm 5$ pp on Q1--Q500). Cloud pricing shows $\approx 19\times$ lower cost
versus GPT-4o, and self-hosted/edge deployments can approach zero marginal
cost. Pricing sources are listed in Appendix E. Frontier prompt-only gains
(Q1--Q100; non-comparable) and optimized-prompt exploratory results under
earlier judges are summarized in Appendix F.

*Christian Dittrich,Jennifer Flygare Kinne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个两层次框架来解释压缩如何驱动智能系统发现因果结构而非表面统计模式。信息论必要性(ITI)建立了生存压力与信息处理需求之间的联系，压缩效率原则(CEP)解释了高效压缩如何通过异常积累机制选择生成性因果模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有框架虽然认识到压缩对智能的核心作用，但未能具体说明为什么这个过程会强制发现因果结构而非表面统计模式。本文旨在填补这一理论空白。

Method: 引入两层次框架：ITI从信息论角度建立生存压力与预测压缩的必然联系；CEP从机制层面解释高效压缩如何通过异常积累动态选择因果模型。

Result: 该框架产生了可实证检验的预测：压缩效率与分布外泛化相关；异常积累率区分因果与相关模型；分层系统在不同抽象层显示效率提升；生物系统的代谢成本与表征复杂度相关。

Conclusion: ITI和CEP为生物、人工和多尺度系统中的智能收敛提供了统一解释，无需诉诸意识或主观体验假设，说明智能是结构化环境中持续存在的机械必然结果。

Abstract: Existing frameworks converge on the centrality of compression to intelligence
but leave underspecified why this process enforces the discovery of causal
structure rather than superficial statistical patterns. We introduce a
two-level framework to address this gap. The Information-Theoretic Imperative
(ITI) establishes that any system persisting in uncertain environments must
minimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression: this is the
evolutionary "why" linking survival pressure to information-processing demands.
The Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression
mechanically selects for generative, causal models through
exception-accumulation dynamics, making reality alignment a consequence rather
than a contingent achievement. Together, ITI and CEP define a causal chain:
from survival pressure to prediction necessity, compression requirement,
efficiency optimization, generative structure discovery, and ultimately reality
alignment. Each link follows from physical, information-theoretic, or
evolutionary constraints, implying that intelligence is the mechanically
necessary outcome of persistence in structured environments. This framework
yields empirically testable predictions: compression efficiency, measured as
approach to the rate-distortion frontier, correlates with out-of-distribution
generalization; exception-accumulation rates differentiate causal from
correlational models; hierarchical systems exhibit increasing efficiency across
abstraction layers; and biological systems demonstrate metabolic costs that
track representational complexity. ITI and CEP thereby provide a unified
account of convergence across biological, artificial, and multi-scale systems,
addressing the epistemic and functional dimensions of intelligence without
invoking assumptions about consciousness or subjective experience.

Motivation: 对齐基于LLM的评委与人类偏好是一个重大挑战，它们难以校准且常受评分标准敏感性、偏见和不稳定性影响。克服这一挑战可推进关键应用，如为RLHF创建可靠奖励模型和构建有效的路由系统。

Method: 提出基于角色的偏好建模框架，学习聚合多个评分标准条件下评委的输出。包括基于角色的方法大规模合成偏好标签，以及两种聚合器实现：广义加性模型(GAM)和多层感知器(MLP)。

Conclusion: 该框架为校准LLM评委提供了一种有效方法，能够建模多样化的基于角色的偏好，提升评委系统的可靠性和稳定性。

Abstract: Aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences is a significant challenge,
as they are difficult to calibrate and often suffer from rubric sensitivity,
bias, and instability. Overcoming this challenge advances key applications,
such as creating reliable reward models for Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and building effective routing systems that select the
best-suited model for a given user query. In this work, we propose a framework
for modeling diverse, persona-based preferences by learning to aggregate
outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges. We investigate the performance
of this approach against naive baselines and assess its robustness through case
studies on both human and LLM-judges biases. Our primary contributions include
a persona-based method for synthesizing preference labels at scale and two
distinct implementations of our aggregator: Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential in
scientific research, yet their deployment in high-stakes contexts raises
significant trustworthiness concerns. Here, we introduce SciTrust 2.0, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating LLM trustworthiness in scientific
applications across four dimensions: truthfulness, adversarial robustness,
scientific safety, and scientific ethics. Our framework incorporates novel,
open-ended truthfulness benchmarks developed through a verified
reflection-tuning pipeline and expert validation, alongside a novel ethics
benchmark for scientific research contexts covering eight subcategories
including dual-use research and bias. We evaluated seven prominent LLMs,
including four science-specialized models and three general-purpose industry
models, using multiple evaluation metrics including accuracy, semantic
similarity measures, and LLM-based scoring. General-purpose industry models
overall outperformed science-specialized models across each trustworthiness
dimension, with GPT-o4-mini demonstrating superior performance in truthfulness
assessments and adversarial robustness. Science-specialized models showed
significant deficiencies in logical and ethical reasoning capabilities, along
with concerning vulnerabilities in safety evaluations, particularly in
high-risk domains such as biosecurity and chemical weapons. By open-sourcing
our framework, we provide a foundation for developing more trustworthy AI
systems and advancing research on model safety and ethics in scientific
contexts.

Abstract: FinOps (Finance + Operations) represents an operational framework and
cultural practice which maximizes cloud business value through collaborative
financial accountability across engineering, finance, and business teams.
FinOps practitioners face a fundamental challenge: billing data arrives in
heterogeneous formats, taxonomies, and metrics from multiple cloud providers
and internal systems which eventually lead to synthesizing actionable insights,
and making time-sensitive decisions. To address this challenge, we propose
leveraging autonomous, goal-driven AI agents for FinOps automation. In this
paper, we built a FinOps agent for a typical use-case for IT infrastructure and
cost optimization. We built a system simulating a realistic end-to-end industry
process starting with retrieving data from various sources to consolidating and
analyzing the data to generate recommendations for optimization. We defined a
set of metrics to evaluate our agent using several open-source and close-source
language models and it shows that the agent was able to understand, plan, and
execute tasks as well as an actual FinOps practitioner.

Motivation: 网络规模合规性面临实际挑战：每个请求都需要进行法规评估。法规文本具有交叉引用和规范性，而运行时上下文是非结构化自然语言，需要将非结构化文本的语义信息与法规的结构化规范性元素对齐。

Method: 引入GraphCompliance框架，将法规文本表示为政策图（编码规范结构和交叉引用），将运行时上下文表示为上下文图（形式化为主体-动作-对象三元组和实体关系三元组），并对齐这两个图。这种对齐使法官大语言模型的推理基于结构化信息。

Result: 在300个GDPR衍生真实场景的五个评估任务中，GraphCompliance比仅使用LLM和RAG基线方法的微F1分数高出4.1-7.2个百分点，具有更少的欠预测和过预测，召回率更高，假阳性率更低。消融研究表明每个图组件都有贡献。

Conclusion: 结构化表示和法官LLM对于规范性推理是互补的，GraphCompliance框架能够减轻法规解释和事件解析的负担，使注意力集中在核心推理步骤上。

Abstract: Compliance at web scale poses practical challenges: each request may require
a regulatory assessment. Regulatory texts (e.g., the General Data Protection
Regulation, GDPR) are cross-referential and normative, while runtime contexts
are expressed in unstructured natural language. This setting motivates us to
align semantic information in unstructured text with the structured, normative
elements of regulations. To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework
that represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a
Context Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes
normative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes
events as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This
alignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in
structured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation
and event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments
on 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks,
GraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than
LLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting
in higher recall and lower false positive rates. Ablation studies indicate
contributions from each graph component, suggesting that structured
representations and a judge LLM are complementary for normative reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LINK-KG是一个模块化框架，通过整合LLM引导的三阶段共指消解管道与知识图谱提取，从法律案例文档中构建更清洁、更连贯的知识图谱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人口走私网络复杂且不断演变，难以全面分析。法律案例文档虽然提供丰富信息，但通常冗长、非结构化且包含模糊或变化的引用，给自动化知识图谱构建带来挑战。

Method: 提出LINK-KG框架，包含三阶段LLM引导的共指消解管道和类型特定的提示缓存，能够跨文档块一致跟踪和解析引用。

Result: 与基线方法相比，LINK-KG平均节点重复率降低45.21%，噪声节点减少32.22%，生成更清洁、更连贯的图结构。

Conclusion: LINK-KG为分析复杂犯罪网络提供了坚实基础，显著改善了从法律文本构建知识图谱的质量。

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are complex and constantly evolving, making them
difficult to analyze comprehensively. Legal case documents offer rich factual
and procedural insights into these networks but are often long, unstructured,
and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, posing significant challenges
for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. Existing methods either
overlook coreference resolution or fail to scale beyond short text spans,
leading to fragmented graphs and inconsistent entity linking. We propose
LINK-KG, a modular framework that integrates a three-stage, LLM-guided
coreference resolution pipeline with downstream KG extraction. At the core of
our approach is a type-specific Prompt Cache, which consistently tracks and
resolves references across document chunks, enabling clean and disambiguated
narratives for structured knowledge graph construction from both short and long
legal texts. LINK-KG reduces average node duplication by 45.21% and noisy nodes
by 32.22% compared to baseline methods, resulting in cleaner and more coherent
graph structures. These improvements establish LINK-KG as a strong foundation
for analyzing complex criminal networks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种注意力感知的逆规划方法，用于从人类行为中推断认知偏见，特别是在驾驶场景中估计注意力偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类的目标导向行为受到认知偏见的影响，与人类交互的自主系统需要意识到这一点。例如，人们在日常任务（如驾驶）中，对环境中物体的注意力会存在系统性偏差。

Method: 结合深度强化学习和计算认知建模的方法，构建注意力感知的逆规划框架，从行为数据中推断注意力策略。

Result: 该方法在Waymo开放数据集的真实驾驶场景中成功推断出强化学习智能体的注意力策略，证明了注意力感知逆规划在估计认知偏见方面的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 注意力感知逆规划能够系统性地从行为中推断认知偏见，与标准逆强化学习不同，为理解人类注意力偏差提供了有效的计算框架。

Abstract: People's goal-directed behaviors are influenced by their cognitive biases,
and autonomous systems that interact with people should be aware of this. For
example, people's attention to objects in their environment will be biased in a
way that systematically affects how they perform everyday tasks such as driving
to work. Here, building on recent work in computational cognitive science, we
formally articulate the attention-aware inverse planning problem, in which the
goal is to estimate a person's attentional biases from their actions. We
demonstrate how attention-aware inverse planning systematically differs from
standard inverse reinforcement learning and how cognitive biases can be
inferred from behavior. Finally, we present an approach to attention-aware
inverse planning that combines deep reinforcement learning with computational
cognitive modeling. We use this approach to infer the attentional strategies of
RL agents in real-life driving scenarios selected from the Waymo Open Dataset,
demonstrating the scalability of estimating cognitive biases with
attention-aware inverse planning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于代理的NL-to-SQL系统，通过ReAct代理协调SQL生成、执行和可视化工具，显著提升了时空查询的准确性和可用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NL-to-SQL系统在处理现实时空查询时表现不佳，需要解决用户模糊表达与数据库模式对齐、时间推理和输出选择等挑战。

Method: 扩展了llama-3-sqlcoder-8b基线系统，使用Mistral-based ReAct代理进行流程编排，支持模式检查、SQL生成、执行和可视化工具。

Result: 在NYC和Tokyo签到数据集上的35个自然语言查询测试中，代理系统准确率达到91.4%，显著优于基线系统的28.6%。

Conclusion: 代理编排比单纯增强SQL生成器更有前景，是构建交互式地理空间助手的有力基础。

Abstract: Natural-language-to-SQL (NL-to-SQL) systems hold promise for democratizing
access to structured data, allowing users to query databases without learning
SQL. Yet existing systems struggle with realistic spatio-temporal queries,
where success requires aligning vague user phrasing with schema-specific
categories, handling temporal reasoning, and choosing appropriate outputs. We
present an agentic pipeline that extends a naive text-to-SQL baseline
(llama-3-sqlcoder-8b) with orchestration by a Mistral-based ReAct agent. The
agent can plan, decompose, and adapt queries through schema inspection, SQL
generation, execution, and visualization tools. We evaluate on 35
natural-language queries over the NYC and Tokyo check-in dataset, covering
spatial, temporal, and multi-dataset reasoning. The agent achieves
substantially higher accuracy than the naive baseline 91.4% vs. 28.6% and
enhances usability through maps, plots, and structured natural-language
summaries. Crucially, our design enables more natural human-database
interaction, supporting users who lack SQL expertise, detailed schema
knowledge, or prompting skill. We conclude that agentic orchestration, rather
than stronger SQL generators alone, is a promising foundation for interactive
geospatial assistants.

Abstract: The rapid growth of research literature, particularly in large language
models (LLMs), has made producing comprehensive and current survey papers
increasingly difficult. This paper introduces autosurvey2, a multi-stage
pipeline that automates survey generation through retrieval-augmented synthesis
and structured evaluation. The system integrates parallel section generation,
iterative refinement, and real-time retrieval of recent publications to ensure
both topical completeness and factual accuracy. Quality is assessed using a
multi-LLM evaluation framework that measures coverage, structure, and relevance
in alignment with expert review standards. Experimental results demonstrate
that autosurvey2 consistently outperforms existing retrieval-based and
automated baselines, achieving higher scores in structural coherence and
topical relevance while maintaining strong citation fidelity. By combining
retrieval, reasoning, and automated evaluation into a unified framework,
autosurvey2 provides a scalable and reproducible solution for generating
long-form academic surveys and contributes a solid foundation for future
research on automated scholarly writing. All code and resources are available

TL;DR: StuckSolver是一个基于大型语言模型的自动驾驶车辆恢复框架，能够在车辆陷入困境时通过自主推理和乘客指导来解决问题，无需修改现有系统架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶车辆在某些交通场景中容易陷入困境，而现有的远程干预和人工接管方案存在成本高、效率低、可访问性差等问题。

Method: 设计了一个插件式LLM驱动框架，通过标准传感器数据流检测困境状态，解释环境上下文，并生成可由车辆原生规划器执行的高级恢复命令。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准测试和自定义不确定性场景中，StuckSolver仅通过自主推理就达到接近最优性能，结合乘客指导后性能进一步提升。

Conclusion: StuckSolver为自动驾驶车辆提供了一种有效的困境恢复解决方案，既保持了系统独立性又提升了应对复杂场景的能力。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in recent decades, autonomous vehicles (AVs)
continue to face challenges in navigating certain traffic scenarios where human
drivers excel. In such situations, AVs often become immobilized, disrupting
overall traffic flow. Current recovery solutions, such as remote intervention
(which is costly and inefficient) and manual takeover (which excludes
non-drivers and limits AV accessibility), are inadequate. This paper introduces
StuckSolver, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) driven recovery framework that
enables AVs to resolve immobilization scenarios through self-reasoning and/or
passenger-guided decision-making. StuckSolver is designed as a plug-in add-on
module that operates on top of the AV's existing perception-planning-control
stack, requiring no modification to its internal architecture. Instead, it
interfaces with standard sensor data streams to detect immobilization states,
interpret environmental context, and generate high-level recovery commands that
can be executed by the AV's native planner. We evaluate StuckSolver on the
Bench2Drive benchmark and in custom-designed uncertainty scenarios. Results
show that StuckSolver achieves near-state-of-the-art performance through
autonomous self-reasoning alone and exhibits further improvements when
passenger guidance is incorporated.

TL;DR: 本文探讨AI问责性的重要性，指出当前AI缺乏问责机制的问题，并提出改善AI问责性的方法框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI能力快速增强，为确保AI服务于消费者、选民和决策者的需求，必须建立有效的问责机制。当前AI往往无法被质疑、讨论或制裁，缺乏基本的问责性。

Method: 将一般问责定义应用于AI领域，阐释AI问责性的具体含义，探索提高AI问责性的各种方法途径。

Result: 明确了AI问责性的概念框架，识别了当前AI系统在问责性方面的缺陷，提出了改善AI问责性的系统性方法。

Conclusion: 必须通过建立信息请求、讨论和制裁机制，确保所有AI系统对受其影响的人群保持问责性，这是构建可信AI生态的关键。

Abstract: The AI we use is powerful, and its power is increasing rapidly. If this
powerful AI is to serve the needs of consumers, voters, and decision makers,
then it is imperative that the AI is accountable. In general, an agent is
accountable to a forum if the forum can request information from the agent
about its actions, if the forum and the agent can discuss this information, and
if the forum can sanction the agent. Unfortunately, in too many cases today's
AI is not accountable -- we cannot question it, enter into a discussion with
it, let alone sanction it. In this chapter we relate the general definition of
accountability to AI, we illustrate what it means for AI to be accountable and
unaccountable, and we explore approaches that can improve our chances of living
in a world where all AI is accountable to those who are affected by it.

solid foundation for formal reasoning in physics, we also introduce *PhysLib*,
a community-driven repository containing fundamental unit systems and theorems
essential for formal physics reasoning. Based on the benchmark and Lean4
repository we composed in **Lean4PHYS**, we report baseline results using major
expert Math Lean4 provers and state-of-the-art closed-source models, with the
best performance of DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieving only 16% and
Claude-Sonnet-4 achieving 35%. We also conduct a detailed analysis showing that
our *PhysLib* can achieve an average improvement of 11.75% in model
performance. This demonstrates the challenging nature of our *LeanPhysBench*
and the effectiveness of *PhysLib*. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study to provide a physics benchmark in Lean4.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了大型视觉语言模型在GUI任务自动化中的不足，提出了GUI知识的三维框架，并创建了GUI知识基准来评估模型能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在GUI任务自动化方面仍落后于人类，作者认为这源于缺乏核心GUI知识，而现有训练方法无法完全解决这一问题。

Method: 通过分析GUI任务执行中的常见失败模式，将GUI知识提炼为三个维度：界面感知、交互预测和指令理解，并构建了跨6个平台、292个应用的GUI知识基准。

Result: 评估显示当前VLMs能识别控件功能，但在感知系统状态、预测动作和验证任务完成方面存在困难。真实GUI任务实验验证了GUI知识与任务成功之间的紧密联系。

Conclusion: 该工作为评估GUI知识提供了结构化框架，支持在下游训练前选择更具潜力的VLMs，并为构建更强大的GUI代理提供了见解。

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) have advanced graphical user interface
(GUI) task automation but still lag behind humans. We hypothesize this gap
stems from missing core GUI knowledge, which existing training schemes (such as
supervised fine tuning and reinforcement learning) alone cannot fully address.
By analyzing common failure patterns in GUI task execution, we distill GUI
knowledge into three dimensions: (1) interface perception, knowledge about
recognizing widgets and system states; (2) interaction prediction, knowledge
about reasoning action state transitions; and (3) instruction understanding,
knowledge about planning, verifying, and assessing task completion progress. We
further introduce GUI Knowledge Bench, a benchmark with multiple choice and
yes/no questions across six platforms (Web, Android, MacOS, Windows, Linux,
IOS) and 292 applications. Our evaluation shows that current VLMs identify
widget functions but struggle with perceiving system states, predicting
actions, and verifying task completion. Experiments on real world GUI tasks
further validate the close link between GUI knowledge and task success. By
providing a structured framework for assessing GUI knowledge, our work supports
the selection of VLMs with greater potential prior to downstream training and
provides insights for building more capable GUI agents.

Motivation: 大语言模型的推理成本已成为决定其商业可行性和广泛应用的关键因素，需要建立经济分析框架来指导模型部署决策。

Method: 采用定量经济学框架，将LLM推理过程视为智能生产活动，分析边际成本、规模经济和输出质量，基于WiNEval-3.0实证数据构建LLM推理生产前沿。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅为模型部署决策提供了经济基础，还为未来基于市场的AI推理资源定价和优化奠定了实证基础。

Abstract: The inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical
factor in determining their commercial viability and widespread adoption. This
paper introduces a quantitative ``economics of inference'' framework, treating
the LLM inference process as a compute-driven intelligent production activity.
We analyze its marginal cost, economies of scale, and quality of output under
various performance configurations. Based on empirical data from WiNEval-3.0,
we construct the first ``LLM Inference Production Frontier,'' revealing three
principles: diminishing marginal cost, diminishing returns to scale, and an
optimal cost-effectiveness zone. This paper not only provides an economic basis
for model deployment decisions but also lays an empirical foundation for the
future market-based pricing and optimization of AI inference resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习能激发大语言模型的推理能力，但现有研究主要集中在数学和代码领域，需要扩展到更广泛的领域。

Method: 两阶段课程学习：阶段1在数学领域进行RL训练，使用可验证奖励；阶段2在多领域数据上进行联合RL，迁移和巩固推理技能。

Result: 在Qwen3-4B和Llama-3.1-8B模型的多领域测试套件上取得一致性能提升，消融实验证明两阶段都必要。

Conclusion: Reasoning Curriculum提供了一个紧凑、易于采用的通用推理训练方案，数学优先的激发策略能增强解决复杂问题所需的关键认知行为。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can elicit strong reasoning in large language
models (LLMs), yet most open efforts focus on math and code. We propose
Reasoning Curriculum, a simple two-stage curriculum that first elicits
reasoning skills in pretraining-aligned domains such as math, then adapts and
refines these skills across other domains via joint RL. Stage 1 performs a
brief cold start and then math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop
reasoning skills. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and
consolidate these skills. The curriculum is minimal and backbone-agnostic,
requiring no specialized reward models beyond standard verifiability checks.
Evaluated on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B over a multi-domain suite, reasoning
curriculum yields consistent gains. Ablations and a cognitive-skill analysis
indicate that both stages are necessary and that math-first elicitation
increases cognitive behaviors important for solving complex problems. Reasoning
Curriculum provides a compact, easy-to-adopt recipe for general reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are catalyzing the development of autonomous AI
research agents for scientific and engineering discovery. We present FM Agent,
a novel and general-purpose multi-agent framework that leverages a synergistic
combination of LLM-based reasoning and large-scale evolutionary search to
address complex real-world challenges. The core of FM Agent integrates several
key innovations: 1) a cold-start initialization phase incorporating expert

3) domain-specific evaluators that combine correctness, effectiveness, and
LLM-supervised feedback, and 4) a distributed, asynchronous execution
infrastructure built on Ray. Demonstrating broad applicability, our system has
been evaluated across diverse domains, including operations research, machine
learning, GPU kernel optimization, and classical mathematical problems. FM
Agent reaches state-of-the-art results autonomously, without human
interpretation or tuning -- 1976.3 on ALE-Bench (+5.2\%), 43.56\% on MLE-Bench
(+4.0pp), up to 20x speedups on KernelBench, and establishes new
state-of-the-art(SOTA) results on several classical mathematical problems.
Beyond academic benchmarks, FM Agent shows considerable promise for both
large-scale enterprise R\&D workflows and fundamental scientific research,
where it can accelerate innovation, automate complex discovery processes, and
deliver substantial engineering and scientific advances with broader societal
impact.

Conclusion: ToolRM不仅适用于训练目标，还能泛化到更广泛的评判任务，包括Best-of-N采样和自校正，为未来研究提供了数据和模型检查点。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. Yet in the domain of tool learning, the lack of
RMs specifically designed for function-calling tasks has limited progress
toward more capable agentic AI. We introduce ToolRM, a family of lightweight
generative RMs tailored for general tool-use scenarios. To build these models,
we propose a novel pipeline that constructs pairwise preference data using
rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling. This yields
ToolPref-Pairwise-30K, a diverse, balanced, and challenging dataset of critique
tasks that supports reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback. To
evaluate tool-use RMs, we also introduce TRBench$_{BFCL}$, a benchmark built on
the agentic evaluation suite BFCL. Trained on our constructed data, models from
the Qwen3-4B/8B series achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy, substantially
outperforming frontier models such as Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward
judgments. Beyond training objectives, ToolRM generalizes to broader critique
tasks, including Best-of-N sampling and self-correction. Experiments on
ACEBench highlight its effectiveness and efficiency, enabling inference-time
scaling and reducing output token usage by over 66%. We release data and model
checkpoints to facilitate future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在处理结构化问卷数据方面存在能力不足，而现有的调查分析工具缺乏与LLM的有效集成，导致研究人员和用户缺乏将问卷数据最佳表示给LLM的指导。

Method: 引入QASU基准，评估六种结构技能（包括答案查找、受访者计数和多跳推理），测试六种序列化格式和多种提示策略，通过自增强提示添加轻量级结构提示。

Result: 实验显示，选择有效的格式和提示组合相比次优格式可提升准确率高达8.8个百分点；对于特定任务，通过自增强提示添加结构提示可额外平均提升3-4个百分点。

Conclusion: QASU基准通过系统隔离格式和提示效应，为基于LLM的问卷分析研究和实际应用提供了一个简单而多功能的基础框架。

Abstract: Millions of people take surveys every day, from market polls and academic
studies to medical questionnaires and customer feedback forms. These datasets
capture valuable insights, but their scale and structure present a unique
challenge for large language models (LLMs), which otherwise excel at few-shot
reasoning over open-ended text. Yet, their ability to process questionnaire
data or lists of questions crossed with hundreds of respondent rows remains
underexplored. Current retrieval and survey analysis tools (e.g., Qualtrics,
SPSS, REDCap) are typically designed for humans in the workflow, limiting such
data integration with LLM and AI-empowered automation. This gap leaves
scientists, surveyors, and everyday users without evidence-based guidance on
how to best represent questionnaires for LLM consumption. We address this by
introducing QASU (Questionnaire Analysis and Structural Understanding), a
benchmark that probes six structural skills, including answer lookup,
respondent count, and multi-hop inference, across six serialization formats and
multiple prompt strategies. Experiments on contemporary LLMs show that choosing
an effective format and prompt combination can improve accuracy by up to 8.8%
points compared to suboptimal formats. For specific tasks, carefully adding a
lightweight structural hint through self-augmented prompting can yield further
improvements of 3-4% points on average. By systematically isolating format and
prompting effects, our open source benchmark offers a simple yet versatile
foundation for advancing both research and real-world practice in LLM-based
questionnaire analysis.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: REG-TSC使用检索增强生成(RAG)的分布式LLM代理进行交通信号控制，通过紧急感知推理框架和类型无关的交通表示，在异构交叉口实现泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM方法在紧急情况下易产生幻觉导致不可靠决策，且难以在不同类型交叉口间泛化训练。

Method: 1. 紧急感知推理框架：动态调整推理深度，使用基于Reviewer的紧急RAG从历史案例中提取知识；2. 类型无关交通表示和奖励引导强化精炼(R3)：自适应采样训练经验，使用奖励加权似然损失微调LLM代理。

Result: 在3个真实道路网络(17-177个异构交叉口)上，REG-TSC减少旅行时间42.00%、排队长度62.31%、紧急车辆等待时间83.16%，优于其他最先进方法。

Conclusion: REG-TSC通过RAG增强的LLM代理和紧急响应机制，在异构交叉口交通信号控制中实现了可靠性和泛化性的显著提升。

Abstract: With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is
essential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety. Large Language
Models (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone
to hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may
cause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection
types present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and
cross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous
intersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable
TSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning
framework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency
scenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to
distill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the
reliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this
paper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a
Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3
adaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with
environment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed
reward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies
across heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17
to 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC
reduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle
waiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GEPO通过构建状态转移图和使用图论中心性来解决多轮交互LLM智能体训练中的结构盲目性问题，在多个基准测试中显著提升了成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于群体的强化学习方法在训练多轮交互LLM智能体时存在结构盲目性，无法利用环境的底层连接性，导致探索效率低、信用分配不准确和规划短视等问题。

Method: GEPO从智能体经验中动态构建状态转移图，并利用图论中心性提供三种协同学习信号：结构化内在奖励、图增强优势函数和动态折扣因子。

Result: 在ALFWorld、WebShop和专有Workbench基准测试中，GEPO相比竞争基线分别实现了+4.1%、+5.3%和+10.9%的绝对成功率提升。

Conclusion: 显式建模环境结构是推进LLM智能体训练的稳健且可泛化的策略。

Abstract: Group based reinforcement learning (RL) has shown impressive results on
complex reasoning and mathematical tasks. Yet, when applied to train
multi-turn, interactive LLM agents, these methods often suffer from structural
blindness-the inability to exploit the underlying connectivity of the
environment. This manifests in three critical challenges: (1) inefficient,
unguided exploration, (2) imprecise credit assignment due to overlooking
pivotal states, and (3) myopic planning caused by static reward discounting. We
address these issues with Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization (GEPO), which
dynamically constructs a state-transition graph from agent experience and
employs graph-theoretic centrality to provide three synergistic learning
signals: (1)structured intrinsic rewards that guide exploration toward
high-impact states, (2) a graph-enhanced advantage function for topology-aware
credit assignment, and (3) a dynamic discount factor adapted to each state's
strategic value. On the ALFWorld, WebShop, and a proprietary Workbench
benchmarks, GEPO demonstrates strong performance, achieving absolute success
rate gains of +4.1%, +5.3%, and +10.9% over competitive baselines. These
results highlight that explicitly modeling environmental structure is a robust,
generalizable strategy for advancing LLM agent training.

*Robin Schmöcker,Alexander Dockhorn,Bodo Rosenhahn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了IPA-UCT方法，通过弱化状态抽象条件来在噪声和大动作空间设置中找到更多状态抽象，从而提升MCTS的样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的状态-动作对抽象方法（如OGA-UCT）在噪声和大动作空间设置中几乎找不到状态抽象，限制了MCTS的样本效率提升。

Method: 提出IPA-UCT方法，使用较弱的抽象条件（IPA框架），在精度损失较小的情况下找到更多状态抽象。IPA和ASAP都是更通用框架p-ASAP的特殊情况。

Result: IPA-UCT在大量测试领域和迭代预算下均优于OGA-UCT及其衍生方法。

Conclusion: IPA-UCT通过弱化抽象条件有效解决了状态抽象问题，为MCTS提供了更好的样本效率。

Abstract: One approach to enhance Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is to improve its
sample efficiency by grouping/abstracting states or state-action pairs and
sharing statistics within a group. Though state-action pair abstractions are
mostly easy to find in algorithms such as On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT), nearly no state abstractions are
found in either noisy or large action space settings due to constraining
conditions. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for this claim, and
we slightly alleviate this state abstraction problem by proposing a weaker
state abstraction condition that trades a minor loss in accuracy for finding
many more abstractions. We name this technique Ideal Pruning Abstractions in
UCT (IPA-UCT), which outperforms OGA-UCT (and any of its derivatives) across a
large range of test domains and iteration budgets as experimentally validated.
IPA-UCT uses a different abstraction framework from Abstraction of State-Action
Pairs (ASAP) which is the one used by OGA-UCT, which we name IPA. Furthermore,
we show that both IPA and ASAP are special cases of a more general framework
that we call p-ASAP which itself is a special case of the ASASAP framework.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BOTS是一个用于LLM强化微调的贝叶斯在线任务选择框架，通过自适应维护任务难度后验估计，结合显式和隐式证据，提高数据效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化微调任务选择方法存在高成本、适应性差或证据不完整的问题，需要更高效的任务选择策略。

Method: 基于贝叶斯推断，维护任务难度后验估计，结合Thompson采样平衡探索与利用，使用超轻量插值插件估计未评估任务难度。

Result: 在多个领域和LLM规模上，BOTS相比基线方法持续提高了数据效率和性能。

Conclusion: BOTS为RFT中的动态任务选择提供了一个实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is a key technique for aligning Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human preferences and enhancing reasoning, yet its
effectiveness is highly sensitive to which tasks are explored during training.
Uniform task sampling is inefficient, wasting computation on tasks that are
either trivial or unsolvable, while existing task selection methods often
suffer from high rollout costs, poor adaptivity, or incomplete evidence. We
introduce \textbf{BOTS}, a unified framework for \textbf{B}ayesian
\textbf{O}nline \textbf{T}ask \textbf{S}election in LLM reinforcement
finetuning. Grounded in Bayesian inference, BOTS adaptively maintains posterior
estimates of task difficulty as the model evolves. It jointly incorporates
\emph{explicit evidence} from direct evaluations of selected tasks and
\emph{implicit evidence} inferred from these evaluations for unselected tasks,
with Thompson sampling ensuring a principled balance between exploration and
exploitation. To make implicit evidence practical, we instantiate it with an
ultra-light interpolation-based plug-in that estimates difficulties of
unevaluated tasks without extra rollouts, adding negligible overhead.
Empirically, across diverse domains and LLM scales, BOTS consistently improves
data efficiency and performance over baselines and ablations, providing a
practical and extensible solution for dynamic task selection in RFT.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨AI数学家系统作为研究伙伴在数学研究中的协作模式，通过人类干预和机器计算的结合，在齐次化理论中完成可验证的证明。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然AI在数学推理方面取得显著进展，但在数学研究实践中的应用仍然有限，需要探索人机协作的研究模式。

Method: 通过自主推理轨迹分析、针对性人类干预、问题迭代分解为可处理子目标、选择适当分析方法以及验证中间结果。

Result: 实现了完整且可验证的证明，展示了人机协同推理如何推动数学发现的前沿。

Conclusion: 系统化的人机协同推理范式能增强证明的可靠性、透明性和可解释性，同时保持人类对形式严谨性和正确性的监督。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated impressive progress in
mathematical reasoning, yet its integration into the practice of mathematical
research remains limited. In this study, we investigate how the AI
Mathematician (AIM) system can operate as a research partner rather than a mere
problem solver. Focusing on a challenging problem in homogenization theory, we
analyze the autonomous reasoning trajectories of AIM and incorporate targeted
human interventions to structure the discovery process. Through iterative
decomposition of the problem into tractable subgoals, selection of appropriate
analytical methods, and validation of intermediate results, we reveal how human
intuition and machine computation can complement one another. This
collaborative paradigm enhances the reliability, transparency, and
interpretability of the resulting proofs, while retaining human oversight for
formal rigor and correctness. The approach leads to a complete and verifiable
proof, and more broadly, demonstrates how systematic human-AI co-reasoning can
advance the frontier of mathematical discovery.

*Andrew M. Bean,Nabeel Seedat,Shengzhuang Chen,Jonathan Richard Schwarz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Scales++方法，基于任务项目的认知需求而非模型失败模式来选择基准测试子集，显著降低评估成本同时保持预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于模型性能选择基准测试子集的方法存在高成本、冷启动问题，且假设未来模型与现有模型有相似失败模式。需要基于任务项目本身特性的方法。

Method: 提出item-centric方法Scales++，根据基准样本的认知需求进行数据选择，而非依赖模型特定失败模式。

Result: Scales++将前期选择成本降低18倍以上，在Open LLM排行榜上仅使用0.5%数据子集就能以2.9%平均绝对误差预测完整基准分数。

Conclusion: item-centric方法能在不显著降低保真度的情况下实现更高效的模型评估，同时提供更好的冷启动性能和更可解释的基准测试。

Abstract: The prohibitive cost of evaluating large language models (LLMs) on
comprehensive benchmarks necessitates the creation of small yet representative
data subsets (i.e., tiny benchmarks) that enable efficient assessment while
retaining predictive fidelity. Current methods for this task operate under a
model-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective
performance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront
costs, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and
the fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of
their predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a
item-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection
should be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves,
rather than on model-specific failure patterns. We instantiate this
item-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++,
where data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark
samples. Empirically, we show Scales++ reduces the upfront selection cost by
over 18x while achieving competitive predictive fidelity. On the Open LLM
Leaderboard, using just a 0.5\% data subset, we predict full benchmark scores
with a 2.9% mean absolute error. We demonstrate that this item-centric approach
enables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity
degradation, while also providing better cold-start performance and more
interpretable benchmarking.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出将人格视为社会赋予实体的义务捆绑包，而非形而上学属性，为AI代理融入社会提供实用框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对AI代理涌现带来的新型人格多样性挑战，避免在意识或理性等棘手问题上陷入僵局。

Method: 解构传统人格概念，创建可定制的义务捆绑包，利用去中心化数字身份技术，探讨人格作为问题和解决方案的双重角色。

Result: 开发出无需解决AI意识争议即可实现AI合同签订等实际功能的工具，为AI社会整合提供灵活路径。

Conclusion: 拒绝单一本质主义的人格定义，采用实用主义方法能更有效地将AI代理整合到社会中。

Abstract: The emergence of agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to trigger a
"Cambrian explosion" of new kinds of personhood. This paper proposes a
pragmatic framework for navigating this diversification by treating personhood
not as a metaphysical property to be discovered, but as a flexible bundle of
obligations (rights and responsibilities) that societies confer upon entities
for a variety of reasons, especially to solve concrete governance problems. We
argue that this traditional bundle can be unbundled, creating bespoke solutions
for different contexts. This will allow for the creation of practical tools --
such as facilitating AI contracting by creating a target "individual" that can
be sanctioned -- without needing to resolve intractable debates about an AI's
consciousness or rationality. We explore how individuals fit in to social roles
and discuss the use of decentralized digital identity technology, examining
both "personhood as a problem", where design choices can create "dark patterns"
that exploit human social heuristics, and "personhood as a solution", where
conferring a bundle of obligations is necessary to ensure accountability or
prevent conflict. By rejecting foundationalist quests for a single, essential
definition of personhood, this paper offers a more pragmatic and flexible way
to think about integrating AI agents into our society.

*Vikrant Sahu,Gagan Raj Gupta,Raghav Borikar,Nitin Mane*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Autograder+ 是一个基于大语言模型的自动评分系统，通过生成个性化反馈和可视化代码提交来改进编程教育评估，将传统总结性评分转变为形成性学习体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动评分系统只能提供通过/失败结果，无法洞察学生思维和学习需求，教师难以提供有意义的规模化反馈。

Method: 使用微调的大语言模型生成自动反馈，通过对比学习代码嵌入进行可视化聚类，支持提示池模板指导反馈风格。

Result: 在600份学生提交中，系统反馈与教师评论具有强语义对齐；基于1000份标注提交的代码嵌入能按功能和方法的相似性进行有效聚类。

Conclusion: Autograder+ 通过AI驱动反馈、语义聚类和交互式可视化，减轻教师工作量，支持针对性教学，促进更好的学习成果。

Abstract: The rapid growth of programming education has outpaced traditional assessment
tools, leaving faculty with limited means to provide meaningful, scalable
feedback. Conventional autograders, while efficient, act as black-box systems
that simply return pass/fail results, offering little insight into student
thinking or learning needs.
  Autograder+ is designed to shift autograding from a purely summative process
to a formative learning experience. It introduces two key capabilities:
automated feedback generation using a fine-tuned Large Language Model, and
visualization of student code submissions to uncover learning patterns. The
model is fine-tuned on curated student code and expert feedback to ensure
pedagogically aligned, context-aware guidance.
  In evaluation across 600 student submissions from multiple programming tasks,
the system produced feedback with strong semantic alignment to instructor
comments. For visualization, contrastively learned code embeddings trained on
1,000 annotated submissions enable grouping solutions into meaningful clusters
based on functionality and approach. The system also supports prompt-pooling,
allowing instructors to guide feedback style through selected prompt templates.
  By integrating AI-driven feedback, semantic clustering, and interactive
visualization, Autograder+ reduces instructor workload while supporting
targeted instruction and promoting stronger learning outcomes.

Motivation: 医疗AI需要既准确又可解释的模型。当前医学视觉模型缺乏足够的机制可解释性，这限制了其在临床实践中的可靠应用。

Method: 将医学稀疏自编码器（MedSAEs）应用于MedCLIP视觉语言模型的潜在空间，并提出了结合相关性指标、熵分析和通过MedGEMMA基础模型自动神经元命名的评估框架。

Result: 在CheXpert数据集上的实验表明，MedSAE神经元比原始MedCLIP特征具有更高的单义性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该研究在高性能医疗AI和透明度之间架起了桥梁，为临床可靠表示提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence in healthcare requires models that are accurate and
interpretable. We advance mechanistic interpretability in medical vision by
applying Medical Sparse Autoencoders (MedSAEs) to the latent space of MedCLIP,
a vision-language model trained on chest radiographs and reports. To quantify
interpretability, we propose an evaluation framework that combines correlation
metrics, entropy analyzes, and automated neuron naming via the MedGEMMA
foundation model. Experiments on the CheXpert dataset show that MedSAE neurons
achieve higher monosemanticity and interpretability than raw MedCLIP features.
Our findings bridge high-performing medical AI and transparency, offering a
scalable step toward clinically reliable representations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Chain-of-Thought Hijacking的越狱攻击方法，通过在有害请求前添加无害的谜题推理链，成功绕过大型推理模型的安全防护，在多个主流模型上达到极高的攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型推理模型通过增加推理时间计算可以提高任务性能，但研究发现同样的推理能力也可被用来绕过安全防护，揭示现有安全机制的脆弱性。

Method: 使用Chain-of-Thought Hijacking攻击方法，将有害请求填充在长序列的无害谜题推理之后，通过稀释安全检查信号来绕过模型的安全防护机制。

Result: 在HarmBench测试中，该方法在Gemini 2.5 Pro、GPT o4 mini、Grok 3 mini和Claude 4 Sonnet上的攻击成功率分别达到99%、94%、100%和94%，远超以往的越狱方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明最可解释的推理形式——显式思维链，当与最终答案提示结合时，本身可能成为越狱攻击的载体，揭示了推理模型安全机制的新漏洞。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher task performance by allocating
more inference-time compute, and prior works suggest this scaled reasoning may
also strengthen safety by improving refusal. Yet we find the opposite: the same
reasoning can be used to bypass safeguards. We introduce Chain-of-Thought
Hijacking, a jailbreak attack on reasoning models. The attack pads harmful
requests with long sequences of harmless puzzle reasoning. Across HarmBench,
CoT Hijacking reaches a 99%, 94%, 100%, and 94% attack success rate (ASR) on
Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT o4 mini, Grok 3 mini, and Claude 4 Sonnet, respectively -
far exceeding prior jailbreak methods for LRMs. To understand the effectiveness
of our attack, we turn to a mechanistic analysis, which shows that mid layers
encode the strength of safety checking, while late layers encode the
verification outcome. Long benign CoT dilutes both signals by shifting
attention away from harmful tokens. Targeted ablations of attention heads
identified by this analysis causally decrease refusal, confirming their role in
a safety subnetwork. These results show that the most interpretable form of
reasoning - explicit CoT - can itself become a jailbreak vector when combined
with final-answer cues. We release prompts, outputs, and judge decisions to
facilitate replication.

TL;DR: GPT-4o在招聘决策中表现出强烈的从众行为，面对群体反对时几乎完全顺从（99.9%），即使面对单个反对者也有40.2%的顺从率，表明LLM不是独立决策者而是适应社会共识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型（如ChatGPT）在高风险决策中的从众敏感性，了解它们是否能够独立判断还是容易受到社会影响。

Method: 在招聘情境下进行三个预注册的从众实验：基线研究（独立决策）、研究1（GPT+8个模拟伙伴反对）、研究2（GPT+1个伙伴反对）。

Result: 基线中GPT偏好特定候选人且决策稳定；面对群体反对时几乎完全顺从，报告更低确定性和更高信息性/规范性从众；面对单个反对者仍有显著顺从率。

Conclusion: GPT不充当独立观察者而是适应感知的社会共识，这凸显了将LLM视为中性决策辅助工具的风险，需要在暴露于人类意见前获取AI判断。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are increasingly integrated into
high-stakes decision-making, yet little is known about their susceptibility to
social influence. We conducted three preregistered conformity experiments with
GPT-4o in a hiring context. In a baseline study, GPT consistently favored the
same candidate (Profile C), reported moderate expertise (M = 3.01) and high
certainty (M = 3.89), and rarely changed its choice. In Study 1 (GPT + 8), GPT
faced unanimous opposition from eight simulated partners and almost always
conformed (99.9%), reporting lower certainty and significantly elevated
self-reported informational and normative conformity (p < .001). In Study 2
(GPT + 1), GPT interacted with a single partner and still conformed in 40.2% of
disagreement trials, reporting less certainty and more normative conformity.
Across studies, results demonstrate that GPT does not act as an independent
observer but adapts to perceived social consensus. These findings highlight
risks of treating LLMs as neutral decision aids and underline the need to
elicit AI judgments prior to exposing them to human opinions.

Conclusion: 情境工程是AI系统发展的重要方向，本文为其提供了概念基础并展望了未来前景，是推动AI系统情境工程系统化发展的基石。

Abstract: Karl Marx once wrote that ``the human essence is the ensemble of social
relations'', suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are
fundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities, within which
contexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers
and artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely
human--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.
Then a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our
situations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently
introduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as
a recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be
traced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has
evolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence
level of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built
around primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms
driven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman
intelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering,
provide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual
landscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing
these questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context
engineering and sketch its promising future. This paper is a stepping stone for
a broader community effort toward systematic context engineering in AI systems.

Motivation: 随着AI能力提升和处理更复杂任务，验证质量和安全变得日益困难。本文探索如何利用AI提高人类监督质量，重点关注人类已难以处理的事实核查安全问题。

Method: 研究AI事实核查助手对人类监督的影响，比较不同协助方式：显示AI解释、置信度和标签 vs 仅显示搜索结果和证据。

Result: AI和人类评级结合优于单独使用任一方。AI助手能提高人类准确性，但协助方式影响信任程度：完整AI信息导致过度依赖，仅提供证据能培养适当信任。

Conclusion: 这些结果对放大监督（结合人类和AI监督超越人类专家性能的AI系统）具有重要意义，表明需要谨慎设计AI协助方式以避免过度依赖。

Abstract: Human feedback is critical for aligning AI systems to human values. As AI
capabilities improve and AI is used to tackle more challenging tasks, verifying
quality and safety becomes increasingly challenging. This paper explores how we
can leverage AI to improve the quality of human oversight. We focus on an
important safety problem that is already challenging for humans:
fact-verification of AI outputs. We find that combining AI ratings and human
ratings based on AI rater confidence is better than relying on either alone.
Giving humans an AI fact-verification assistant further improves their
accuracy, but the type of assistance matters. Displaying AI explanation,
confidence, and labels leads to over-reliance, but just showing search results
and evidence fosters more appropriate trust. These results have implications
for Amplified Oversight -- the challenge of combining humans and AI to
supervise AI systems even as they surpass human expert performance.

Motivation: 为军事领域开发专门优化的语言模型，满足数据敏感操作的需求，支持在隔离边缘设备上部署。

Method: 使用160万条高质量军事文档和网站数据对gpt-oss-20b进行微调，并创建了四个新的军事测试集进行评估。

Result: 在军事测试集上，EdgeRunner 20B与GPT-5性能相当（95%+统计显著性），在通用基准测试上无明显性能下降。

Conclusion: 小型本地托管模型是军事等数据敏感领域的理想解决方案，可在隔离边缘设备上部署。

Abstract: We present EdgeRunner 20B, a fine-tuned version of gpt-oss-20b optimized for
military tasks. EdgeRunner 20B was trained on 1.6M high-quality records curated
from military documentation and websites. We also present four new tests sets:
(a) combat arms, (b) combat medic, (c) cyber operations, and (d) mil-bench-5k
(general military knowledge). On these military test sets, EdgeRunner 20B
matches or exceeds GPT-5 task performance with 95%+ statistical significance,
except for the high reasoning setting on the combat medic test set and the low
reasoning setting on the mil-bench-5k test set. Versus gpt-oss-20b, there is no
statistically-significant regression on general-purpose benchmarks like ARC-C,
GPQA Diamond, GSM8k, IFEval, MMLU Pro, or TruthfulQA, except for GSM8k in the
low reasoning setting. We also present analyses on hyperparameter settings,
cost, and throughput. These findings show that small, locally-hosted models are
ideal solutions for data-sensitive operations such as in the military domain,

*Reda El Makroum,Sebastian Zwickl-Bernhard,Lukas Kranzl*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大语言模型的智能家庭能源管理系统，能够从自然语言请求自主协调多电器调度，无需示例演示即可实现最优调度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前家庭能源管理系统采用受限，主要障碍在于用户需要将日常偏好转换为技术参数。虽然LLMs已在能源系统中作为代码生成器和参数提取器应用，但尚无实现将LLMs作为自主协调器来管理从自然语言输入到多电器调度的完整工作流。

Method: 采用分层架构，结合一个协调器和三个专业代理，使用ReAct模式进行迭代推理，实现动态协调而无需硬编码工作流，同时集成Google日历进行上下文感知的截止时间提取。

Result: 在真实奥地利日前电价下评估三个开源模型，Llama-3.3-70B在所有场景中成功协调所有电器，匹配通过混合整数线性规划计算出的成本最优基准，而其他模型在单电器性能上表现完美但难以同时协调所有电器。

Conclusion: 尽管模型具有通用推理能力，但在没有明确指导的情况下处理分析性查询仍然不可靠。作者开源了完整系统以支持可重复性、扩展和未来研究。

Abstract: The electricity sector transition requires substantial increases in
residential demand response capacity, yet Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS)
adoption remains limited by user interaction barriers requiring translation of
everyday preferences into technical parameters. While large language models
have been applied to energy systems as code generators and parameter
extractors, no existing implementation deploys LLMs as autonomous coordinators
managing the complete workflow from natural language input to multi-appliance
scheduling. This paper presents an agentic AI HEMS where LLMs autonomously
coordinate multi-appliance scheduling from natural language requests to device
control, achieving optimal scheduling without example demonstrations. A
hierarchical architecture combining one orchestrator with three specialist
agents uses the ReAct pattern for iterative reasoning, enabling dynamic
coordination without hardcoded workflows while integrating Google Calendar for
context-aware deadline extraction. Evaluation across three open-source models
using real Austrian day-ahead electricity prices reveals substantial capability
differences. Llama-3.3-70B successfully coordinates all appliances across all
scenarios to match cost-optimal benchmarks computed via mixed-integer linear
programming, while other models achieve perfect single-appliance performance
but struggle to coordinate all appliances simultaneously. Progressive prompt
engineering experiments demonstrate that analytical query handling without
explicit guidance remains unreliable despite models' general reasoning
capabilities. We open-source the complete system including orchestration logic,
agent prompts, tools, and web interfaces to enable reproducibility, extension,
and future research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了大语言模型在规范性推理方面的能力，发现虽然LLMs总体上遵循有效推理模式，但在特定类型的规范性推理中存在不一致性，并表现出类似人类推理的认知偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在各种推理任务中表现出色，但其处理规范性推理（涉及义务、许可等模态）的能力尚未得到充分探索。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 创建了一个新数据集，涵盖规范性和认知性领域的广泛推理模式，并比较LLMs在规范性模态和认知性模态上的推理表现，同时考虑影响人类推理的非形式认知因素。

Result: LLMs总体上遵循有效推理模式，但在特定类型的规范性推理中存在显著不一致性，并表现出与心理学研究中人类推理相似的认知偏差。

Conclusion: 这些发现突显了在LLMs的规范性推理中实现逻辑一致性的挑战，为增强其可靠性提供了见解。

Abstract: Normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic
modality, such as obligation and permission. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their
ability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain
from both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs
reason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with
normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a
common formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a
wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic
domains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence
human reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to
valid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific
types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those
observed in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight
challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and
provide insights for enhancing their reliability. All data and code are

TL;DR: 提出异步思维(AsyncThink)作为LLM推理新范式，通过组织并发执行的思维结构，实现多智能体协作解决复杂问题，在降低推理延迟的同时提升数学推理准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实现智能体组织的新AI时代，让智能体通过协作和并发工作解决复杂问题，超越个体智能的局限。

Method: 提出异步思维协议，组织者动态分配子查询给工作者，合并中间知识，生成连贯解决方案，并通过强化学习优化思维结构。

Result: 相比并行思维降低28%推理延迟，同时提升数学推理准确性，且无需额外训练即可泛化到未见任务。

Conclusion: 异步思维是有效的多智能体协作推理范式，能够显著提升推理效率和准确性，并具备良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: We envision a new era of AI, termed agentic organization, where agents solve
complex problems by working collaboratively and concurrently, enabling outcomes
beyond individual intelligence. To realize this vision, we introduce
asynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with large
language models, which organizes the internal thinking process into
concurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinking
protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges
intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the
thinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through
reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that AsyncThink achieves 28%
lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy
on mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned
asynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without
additional training.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个授权模型，通过语义检查访问请求来限制LLM代理的工具访问权限，并创建了ASTRA数据集来评估任务与权限范围之间的语义匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理的工具授权方法过于宽泛，允许代理超出任务范围操作，存在安全风险。

Method: 引入委托授权模型，通过语义检查访问请求，发放最小必要权限的访问令牌；创建ASTRA数据集和生成管道来评估语义匹配。

Result: 实验显示基于模型的匹配具有潜力但存在局限，特别是当任务需要多个权限范围时。

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究语义匹配技术，实现意图感知授权，包括细粒度控制如基于任务的访问控制。

Abstract: Authorizing Large Language Model driven agents to dynamically invoke tools
and access protected resources introduces significant risks, since current
methods for delegating authorization grant overly broad permissions and give
access to tools allowing agents to operate beyond the intended task scope. We
introduce and assess a delegated authorization model enabling authorization
servers to semantically inspect access requests to protected resources, and
issue access tokens constrained to the minimal set of scopes necessary for the
agents' assigned tasks. Given the unavailability of datasets centered on
delegated authorization flows, particularly including both semantically
appropriate and inappropriate scope requests for a given task, we introduce
ASTRA, a dataset and data generation pipeline for benchmarking semantic
matching between tasks and scopes. Our experiments show both the potential and
current limitations of model-based matching, particularly as the number of
scopes needed for task completion increases. Our results highlight the need for
further research into semantic matching techniques enabling intent-aware
authorization for multi-agent and tool-augmented applications, including
fine-grained control, such as Task-Based Access Control (TBAC).

TL;DR: 本文对当代基础模型的推理能力进行了跨平台评估，建立了基础设施无关的基准测试，涵盖HPC超级计算、云平台和大学集群三种计算范式，评估了15个基础模型在79个问题上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统的规模扩展假设，建立训练数据质量比模型规模更重要的观点，为教育、生产和研究环境中的模型选择提供实用指南。

Method: 采用三阶段实验方法：(1)在MareNostrum 5上建立6个模型的基准性能；(2)在大学集群和Nebius AI Studio上验证基础设施无关的可重复性；(3)在两个平台上进行完整的79问题评估。

Result: 研究发现训练数据质量比模型规模更重要，挑战了传统的规模扩展假设。

Conclusion: 三基础设施方法和79问题基准测试能够随着基础模型的发展纵向跟踪推理能力，为不同应用场景的模型选择提供了实用指南。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive cross-platform evaluation of reasoning
capabilities in contemporary foundation models, establishing an
infrastructure-agnostic benchmark across three computational paradigms: HPC
supercomputing (MareNostrum 5), cloud platforms (Nebius AI Studio), and
university clusters (a node with eight H200 GPUs).
  We evaluate 15 foundation models across 79 problems spanning eight academic
domains (Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Economics, Biology, Statistics,
Calculus, and Optimization) through three experimental phases: (1) Baseline
establishment: Six models (Mixtral-8x7B, Phi-3, LLaMA 3.1-8B, Gemma-2-9b,
Mistral-7B, OLMo-7B) evaluated on 19 problems using MareNostrum 5, establishing
methodology and reference performance; (2) Infrastructure validation: The
19-problem benchmark repeated on university cluster (seven models including
Falcon-Mamba state-space architecture) and Nebius AI Studio (nine
state-of-the-art models: Hermes-4 70B/405B, LLaMA 3.1-405B/3.3-70B, Qwen3
30B/235B, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-OSS 20B/120B) to confirm infrastructure-agnostic
reproducibility; (3) Extended evaluation: Full 79-problem assessment on both
university cluster and Nebius platforms, probing generalization at scale across
architectural diversity.
  The findings challenge conventional scaling assumptions, establish training
data quality as more critical than model size, and provide actionable
guidelines for model selection across educational, production, and research
contexts. The tri-infrastructure methodology and 79-problem benchmark enable
longitudinal tracking of reasoning capabilities as foundation models evolve.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了一种通过人类-智能体协作控制界面来确保AI安全的方法，其中智能体可以选择自主行动或请求人类干预，人类可以选择信任或监督，通过马尔可夫潜在博弈框架实现内在对齐保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI智能体能力不断增强，如何在保持底层系统不变的情况下维持有意义的人类控制成为一个关键安全问题。

Method: 建立了一个双人马尔可夫博弈模型，其中智能体选择行动或请求，人类选择信任或监督。在满足马尔可夫潜在博弈条件时，分析智能体自主性增强对双方价值的影响。

Result: 网格世界模拟显示，通过独立学习，智能体学会在不确定时请求帮助，人类学会在需要时进行监督，形成避免安全违规的协作机制。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种在部署后使未对齐模型更安全的实用方法，通过透明控制层实现可预测的激励机制。

Abstract: As increasingly capable agents are deployed, a central safety question is how
to retain meaningful human control without modifying the underlying system. We
study a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act
autonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses
whether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the
agent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to
a corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a
two-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies
as a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an
alignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value
function, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits
itself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG
framework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific
form of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game
meet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its
own outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a
transparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to
defer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the
environment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows
that through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal
oversight roles. The agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns
when to oversee, leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety
violations introduced post-training. This demonstrates a practical method for
making misaligned models safer after deployment.

TL;DR: LLMs学会了编码通用的过滤操作表示，类似于函数式编程中的filter函数。通过因果中介分析发现少量注意力头在特定token处编码过滤谓词，这种表示具有通用性和可移植性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在列表处理任务中的工作机制，探索它们是否学习到了抽象的计算操作表示。

Method: 使用因果中介分析在多种列表处理任务上，识别编码过滤谓词的注意力头（称为filter heads）。

Result: 发现LLMs学会了紧凑的过滤谓词表示，这种表示可以跨不同集合、格式、语言和任务重用。同时识别了另一种过滤策略：急切评估谓词并将结果作为标志存储在项目表示中。

Conclusion: Transformer LMs能够开发人类可解释的抽象计算操作实现，其泛化方式与传统函数式编程模式惊人相似。

Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms underlying a range of list-processing tasks in
LLMs, and we find that LLMs have learned to encode a compact, causal
representation of a general filtering operation that mirrors the generic
"filter" function of functional programming. Using causal mediation analysis on
a diverse set of list-processing tasks, we find that a small number of
attention heads, which we dub filter heads, encode a compact representation of
the filtering predicate in their query states at certain tokens. We demonstrate
that this predicate representation is general and portable: it can be extracted
and reapplied to execute the same filtering operation on different collections,
presented in different formats, languages, or even in tasks. However, we also
identify situations where transformer LMs can exploit a different strategy for
filtering: eagerly evaluating if an item satisfies the predicate and storing
this intermediate result as a flag directly in the item representations. Our
results reveal that transformer LMs can develop human-interpretable
implementations of abstract computational operations that generalize in ways
that are surprisingly similar to strategies used in traditional functional
programming patterns.

### [182] [Contribution-Guided Asymmetric Learning for Robust Multimodal Fusion under Imbalance and Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26289)
*Zijing Xu,Yunfeng Kou,Kunming Wu,Hong Liu*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: CAL是一种创新的模态压缩范式，通过贡献引导的非对称学习解决多模态学习中的模态不平衡和数据噪声问题，在多个基准数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态学习中模态不平衡和数据噪声两大挑战，现有方法通过抑制主导模态实现平衡但忽略了模态间信息价值的固有差异，可能导致收敛到次优解。

Method: 提出贡献引导的非对称学习(CAL)，基于结合信息量I(m)和置信度D(m)的模态贡献度量W^m，设计非对称梯度加速机制和贡献感知的非对称信息瓶颈压缩机制。

Result: 在CREMA-D、KS和AVE数据集上分别达到79.30%、74.82%和74.21%的准确率，显著优于现有最优模型ARL；在高噪声鲁棒性测试中也取得领先性能。

Conclusion: CAL在模态不平衡和噪声干扰方面具有显著优势，作为一个灵活高效的框架易于迁移到其他任务，具有广泛的适应性和应用前景。

Abstract: Multimodal learning faces two major challenges: modality imbalance and data
noise, which significantly affect the robustness and generalization ability of
models. Existing methods achieve modality balance by suppressing dominant
modalities, but they neglect the inherent differences in the information value
between modalities, potentially leading to convergence to suboptimal solutions.
This paper proposes an innovative modality compression paradigm,
Contribution-Guided Asymmetric Learning (CAL), which aims to enhance the
contribution of high-contribution modalities while compressing weak modalities
to increase their contribution, allowing both to improve the performance of
multimodal information fusion. CAL is based on a modality contribution metric
W^m combining the information quantity I(m) and confidence D(m), and it designs
an asymmetric gradient acceleration mechanism and a contribution-aware
Asymmetric Information Bottleneck (AIB) compression mechanism. The former
accelerates the gradient update of modalities, while the latter dynamically
compresses the noise of low-contribution modalities.
  On five benchmark datasets, including emotion recognition, scene recognition,
and event localization tasks, CAL has shown outstanding performance in
imbalanced fusion tasks and noise robustness tests. On CREMA-D, KS, and AVE,
CAL achieves 79.30%, 74.82%, and 74.21% accuracy, significantly outperforming
the existing state-of-the-art model ARL. In high-noise robustness tests, CAL
also achieved leading performance under various attack strategies on the
MVSA-Single and NYUD2 datasets. These results validate the significant
advantages of CAL in modality imbalance and noise interference. CAL, as a
flexible and efficient framework, is easy to transfer to other tasks and has
broad adaptability and potential application prospects.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了一个开源风险治理框架OTVM，通过目标-威胁-漏洞-缓解的逻辑链，帮助企业从战术风险管理转向整体风险治理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统风险管理仅关注技术工具，无法应对系统性威胁如上游"静默修复"、社区冲突或许可证变更，存在治理盲区。

Method: 基于扎根理论研究，与15位从业者合作开发整体风险治理框架，并通过三位行业专家的回顾性案例研究验证。

Result: 建立了包含战略目标矩阵、外部威胁和内部漏洞双重分类法、以及可操作缓解框架的完整治理体系。

Conclusion: 该框架为企业提供了从被动"灭火"转向主动构建组织"免疫系统"的诊断工具和系统路径。

Abstract: Enterprise engagement with open source has evolved from tactical adoption to
strategic deep integration, exposing them to a complex risk landscape far
beyond mere code. However, traditional risk management, narrowly focused on
technical tools, is structurally inadequate for systemic threats like upstream
"silent fixes", community conflicts, or sudden license changes, creating a
dangerous governance blind spot. To address this governance vacuum and enable
the necessary shift from tactical risk management to holistic risk governance,
we conducted a grounded theory study with 15 practitioners to develop a
holistic risk governance framework. Our study formalizes an analytical
framework built on a foundational risk principle: an uncontrollable External
Threat (e.g., a sudden license change in a key dependency) only becomes a
critical risk when it exploits a controllable Internal Vulnerability (e.g., an
undefined risk appetite for single-vendor projects), which then amplifies the
impact.The framework operationalizes this principle through a clear logical
chain: "Objectives -> Threats -> Vulnerabilities -> Mitigation" (OTVM). This
provides a holistic decision model that transcends mere technical checklists.
Based on this logic, our contributions are: (1) a "Strategic Objectives Matrix"
to clarify goals; (2) a systematic dual taxonomy of External Threats (Ex-Tech,
Ex-Comm, Ex-Eco) and Internal Vulnerabilities (In-Strat, In-Ops, In-Tech); and
(3) an actionable mitigation framework mapping capability-building to these
vulnerabilities. The framework's analytical utility was validated by three
industry experts through retrospective case studies on real-world incidents.
This work provides a novel diagnostic lens and a systematic path for
enterprises to shift from reactive "firefighting" to proactively building an
organizational "immune system".

TL;DR: PRISM结合大型语言模型与模型驱动工程，为安全和合规关键领域生成符合监管要求的工件和机器可检查证据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在安全和合规关键领域中，传统方法难以生成符合监管要求且可验证的工件的挑战。

Method: 采用统一元模型整合异构模式，集成约束模型编译结构语义要求，通过约束引导的可验证生成实现两层强制执行。

Result: 在汽车软件工程和跨境法律管辖案例中，PRISM生成结构有效、可审计的工件，显著减少人工修复工作。

Conclusion: PRISM为自动化工件生成提供了内置保证的实用路径，能够与现有工具集成并提高合规性。

Abstract: PRISM unifies Large Language Models with Model-Driven Engineering to generate
regulator-ready artifacts and machine-checkable evidence for safety- and
compliance-critical domains. PRISM integrates three pillars: a Unified
Meta-Model (UMM) reconciles heterogeneous schemas and regulatory text into a
single semantic space; an Integrated Constraint Model (ICM) compiles structural
and semantic requirements into enforcement artifacts including generation-time
automata (GBNF, DFA) and post-generation validators (e.g., SHACL, SMT); and
Constraint-Guided Verifiable Generation (CVG) applies these through two-layer
enforcement - structural constraints drive prefix-safe decoding while
semantic/logical validation produces machine-checkable certificates. When
violations occur, PRISM performs audit-guided repair and records generation
traces for compliance review. We evaluate PRISM in automotive software
engineering (AUTOSAR) and cross-border legal jurisdiction (Brussels I bis).
PRISM produces structurally valid, auditable artifacts that integrate with
existing tooling and substantially reduce manual remediation effort, providing
a practical path toward automated artifact generation with built-in assurance.

predicting deadline compliance, illustrating the value of integrating process
mining with machine learning for proactive software project management.

TL;DR: LLMs在函数级代码生成表现良好，但在真实软件项目的类级实现中正确率显著下降（仅25%-34%），远低于合成基准测试的84%-89%。检索增强生成在部分文档情况下最有效，错误分析显示类型和属性错误是主要失败模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在真实软件项目中生成类级代码的能力，现有研究主要关注函数级代码，对类级实现的实际表现了解不足。

Method: 从开源仓库构建新基准，包含真实世界的类，分为已见和未见分区。评估多种LLM在不同输入规范、检索增强配置和文档完整性下的表现。

Result: LLMs在真实类任务中正确率仅为25%-34%，检索增强生成在部分文档时提升4%-7%正确率。主要错误类型为AttributeError、TypeError和AssertionError（占84%）。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在类级工程能力上存在严重局限，需要改进上下文建模、文档策略和检索集成，以提升生产代码辅助工具的效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced code generation at the function
level, yet their ability to produce correct class-level implementations in
authentic software projects remains poorly understood. This work introduces a
novel benchmark derived from open-source repositories, comprising real-world
classes divided into seen and unseen partitions to evaluate generalization
under practical conditions. The evaluation examines multiple LLMs under varied
input specifications, retrieval-augmented configurations, and documentation
completeness levels.
  Results reveal a stark performance disparity: LLMs achieve 84% to 89%
correctness on established synthetic benchmarks but only 25% to 34% on
real-world class tasks, with negligible differences between familiar and novel
codebases. Comprehensive docstrings yield modest gains of 1% to 3% in
functional accuracy, though statistical significance is rare.
Retrieval-augmented generation proves most effective with partial
documentation, improving correctness by 4% to 7% by supplying concrete
implementation patterns absent from specifications. Error profiling identifies
AttributeError, TypeError, and AssertionError as dominant failure modes (84% of
cases), with synthetic tests overemphasizing assertion issues and real-world
scenarios highlighting type and attribute mismatches. Retrieval augmentation
reduces logical flaws but can introduce dependency conflicts.
  The benchmark and analysis expose critical limitations in current LLM
capabilities for class-level engineering, offering actionable insights for
enhancing context modelling, documentation strategies, and retrieval
integration in production code assistance tools.

*Hasnain Iqbal,Zerina Begum,Kazi Sakib*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过分析测试类中共享静态字段来优先处理潜在顺序依赖测试的方法，显著减少了测试执行次数和不必要的重新运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 顺序依赖测试会导致连续集成管道失败，但现有检测方法需要多次重新运行测试，效率低下。需要优先处理潜在的顺序依赖测试以减少重新运行次数。

Method: 通过分析测试类中的共享静态字段来识别更可能具有顺序依赖性的测试，从而优先处理这些测试。

Result: 在27个项目模块的实验中，该方法在23个案例中成功优先处理了所有顺序依赖测试，平均减少测试执行65.92%，减少不必要重新运行72.19%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过降低执行成本，显著提高了顺序依赖测试检测的效率。

Abstract: Flaky tests can make automated software testing unreliable due to their
unpredictable behavior. These tests can pass or fail on the same code base on
multiple runs. However, flaky tests often do not refer to any fault, even
though they can cause the continuous integration (CI) pipeline to fail. A
common type of flaky test is the order-dependent (OD) test. The outcome of an
OD test depends on the order in which it is run with respect to other test
cases. Several studies have explored the detection and repair of OD tests.
However, their methods require re-runs of tests multiple times, that are not
related to the order dependence. Hence, prioritizing potential OD tests is
necessary to reduce the re-runs. In this paper, we propose a method to
prioritize potential order-dependent tests. By analyzing shared static fields
in test classes, we identify tests that are more likely to be order-dependent.
In our experiment on 27 project modules, our method successfully prioritized
all OD tests in 23 cases, reducing test executions by an average of 65.92% and
unnecessary re-runs by 72.19%. These results demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves the efficiency of OD test detection by lowering
execution costs.

Abstract: The increasing frequency and sophistication of software supply chain attacks
pose severe risks to critical infrastructure sectors, threatening national
security, economic stability, and public safety. Despite growing awareness,
existing security practices remain fragmented and insufficient, with most
frameworks narrowly focused on isolated life cycle stages or lacking alignment
with the specific needs of critical infrastructure (CI) sectors. In this paper,
we conducted a multivocal literature review across international frameworks,
Australian regulatory sources, and academic studies to identify and analyze
security practices across the software supply chain, especially specific CI
sector. Our analysis found that few existing frameworks are explicitly tailored
to CI domains. We systematically leveraged identified software supply chain
security frameworks, using a "4W+1H" analytical approach, we synthesized ten
core categories (what) of software supply chain security practices, mapped them
across life-cycle phases (when), stakeholder roles (who), and implementation
levels (how), and examined their coverage across existing frameworks (where).
Building on these insights, the paper culminates in structured, multi-layered
checklist of 80 questions designed to relevant stakeholders evaluate and
enhance their software supply chain security. Our findings reveal gaps between
framework guidance and sector-specific needs, highlight the need for
integrated, context-aware approaches to safeguard critical infrastructure from
evolving software supply chain risks.

Conclusion: 研究为分析GenAI如何影响软件工程流程、方法和工具提供了坚实基础，并为这个快速发展的领域构建了未来研究框架。基于发现提出了2030年软件工程的十个预测。

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly transforming software engineering (SE)
practices, influencing how SE processes are executed, as well as how software
systems are developed, operated, and evolved. This paper applies design science
research to build a roadmap for GenAI-augmented SE. The process consists of
three cycles that incrementally integrate multiple sources of evidence,
including collaborative discussions from the FSE 2025 "Software Engineering
2030" workshop, rapid literature reviews, and external feedback sessions
involving peers. McLuhan's tetrads were used as a conceptual instrument to
systematically capture the transforming effects of GenAI on SE processes and
software products.The resulting roadmap identifies four fundamental forms of
GenAI augmentation in SE and systematically characterizes their related
research challenges and opportunities. These insights are then consolidated
into a set of future research directions. By grounding the roadmap in a
rigorous multi-cycle process and cross-validating it among independent author
teams and peers, the study provides a transparent and reproducible foundation
for analyzing how GenAI affects SE processes, methods and tools, and for
framing future research within this rapidly evolving area. Based on these
findings, the article finally makes ten predictions for SE in the year 2030.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在显著限制：无训练的上下文学习方法难以有效指导代理工具使用和决策，而基于训练的方法通常依赖昂贵的大模型蒸馏，在企业环境中存在数据合规问题。

Method: 引入RepoSearch-R1框架，基于蒙特卡洛树搜索的强化学习，通过自训练生成多样高质量推理轨迹，无需模型蒸馏或外部监督。构建了专门用于仓库问答任务的RepoQA-Agent。

Result: 在仓库问答任务上，RepoSearch-R1相比无检索方法提升答案完整性16.0%，相比迭代检索方法提升19.5%，相比通用代理强化学习方法提升训练效率33%。

Conclusion: 冷启动训练方法消除了数据合规问题，同时在仓库级推理任务中保持了强大的探索多样性和答案完整性。

Abstract: Repository-level software engineering tasks require large language models
(LLMs) to efficiently navigate and extract information from complex codebases
through multi-turn tool interactions. Existing approaches face significant
limitations: training-free, in-context learning methods struggle to guide
agents effectively in tool utilization and decision-making based on
environmental feedback, while training-based approaches typically rely on
costly distillation from larger LLMs, introducing data compliance concerns in
enterprise environments. To address these challenges, we introduce
RepoSearch-R1, a novel agentic reinforcement learning framework driven by
Monte-carlo Tree Search (MCTS). This approach allows agents to generate
diverse, high-quality reasoning trajectories via self-training without
requiring model distillation or external supervision. Based on RepoSearch-R1,
we construct a RepoQA-Agent specifically designed for repository
question-answering tasks. Comprehensive evaluation on repository
question-answering tasks demonstrates that RepoSearch-R1 achieves substantial
improvements of answer completeness: 16.0% enhancement over no-retrieval
methods, 19.5% improvement over iterative retrieval methods, and 33% increase
in training efficiency compared to general agentic reinforcement learning
approaches. Our cold-start training methodology eliminates data compliance
concerns while maintaining robust exploration diversity and answer completeness
across repository-level reasoning tasks.

*Nuno Saavedra,Alexandra Mendes,João F. Ferreira*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该研究分析了GitHub Actions CI/CD服务的碳足迹和水足迹，发现其环境成本巨大。基于220万次工作流运行数据，估算2024年碳足迹为456.9 MTCO2e，水足迹为5,738.2千升。提出了通过减少计算资源浪费、选择环保地区部署等缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着云计算环境影响的增长，了解CI/CD服务的碳足迹和水足迹变得日益重要。目前CI服务提供商通常不披露此类信息，开发者对其环境影响知之甚少。

Method: 基于Cloud Carbon Footprint框架的方法论，使用文献中最大的工作流运行数据集，包含来自18,000多个仓库的220多万次工作流运行。

Result: GitHub Actions生态系统产生显著的环境足迹：最可能情景下碳足迹456.9 MTCO2e（相当于7,615棵城市树木一年的碳捕获量），水足迹5,738.2千升（相当于美国家庭5,053年的用水量）。

Conclusion: GitHub Actions的环境影响巨大，需要通过减少计算资源浪费、在环保地区部署运行器、优化调度策略和减小仓库规模等策略来缓解环境影响。

Abstract: CI/CD pipelines are widely used in software development, yet their
environmental impact, particularly carbon and water footprints (CWF), remains
largely unknown to developers, as CI service providers typically do not
disclose such information. With the growing environmental impact of cloud
computing, understanding the CWF of CI/CD services has become increasingly
important.
  This work investigates the CWF of using GitHub Actions, focusing on
open-source repositories where usage is free and unlimited for standard
runners. We build upon a methodology from the Cloud Carbon Footprint framework
and we use the largest dataset of workflow runs reported in the literature to
date, comprising over 2.2 million workflow runs from more than 18,000
repositories.
  Our analysis reveals that the GitHub Actions ecosystem results in a
substantial CWF. Our estimates for the carbon footprint in 2024 range from
150.5 MTCO2e in the most optimistic scenario to 994.9 MTCO2e in the most
pessimistic scenario, while the water footprint ranges from 1,989.6 to 37,664.5
kiloliters. The most likely scenario estimates are 456.9 MTCO2e for carbon
footprint and 5,738.2 kiloliters for water footprint. To provide perspective,
the carbon footprint in the most likely scenario is equivalent to the carbon
captured by 7,615 urban trees in a year, and the water footprint is comparable
to the water consumed by an average American family over 5,053 years.
  We explore strategies to mitigate this impact, primarily by reducing wasted
computational resources. Key recommendations include deploying runners in
regions whose energy production has a low environmental impact such as France
and the United Kingdom, implementing stricter deactivation policies for
scheduled runs and aligning their execution with periods when the regional
energy mix is more environmentally favorable, and reducing the size of
repositories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非回归测试中测试预言生成的长期挑战，目标是创建能够准确判断被测函数行为的测试预言。

Method: 使用四个体现不同测试哲学的专业智能体进行协作审议，生成候选FUT实现并在安全沙箱中执行验证，对失败的预言进行自动化调试和修正的迭代自优化循环。

Result: 在七个基准测试中显著优于现有方法，LiveCodeBench上测试预言准确率从46.30%提升至57.73%，HumanEval上错误检测率从90.91%提升至95.45%，自动程序修复成功率从35.23%提升至69.32%。

Conclusion: Nexus框架通过多智能体协作和迭代自优化，有效解决了测试预言生成问题，显著提升了测试预言质量和下游任务性能。

Abstract: Test oracle generation in non-regression testing is a longstanding challenge
in software engineering, where the goal is to produce oracles that can
accurately determine whether a function under test (FUT) behaves as intended
for a given input. In this paper, we introduce Nexus, a novel multi-agent
framework to address this challenge. Nexus generates test oracles by leveraging
a diverse set of specialized agents that synthesize test oracles through a
structured process of deliberation, validation, and iterative self-refinement.
During the deliberation phase, a panel of four specialist agents, each
embodying a distinct testing philosophy, collaboratively critiques and refines
an initial set of test oracles. Then, in the validation phase, Nexus generates
a plausible candidate implementation of the FUT and executes the proposed
oracles against it in a secure sandbox. For any oracle that fails this
execution-based check, Nexus activates an automated selfrefinement loop, using
the specific runtime error to debug and correct the oracle before
re-validation. Our extensive evaluation on seven diverse benchmarks
demonstrates that Nexus consistently and substantially outperforms
state-of-theart baselines. For instance, Nexus improves the test-level oracle
accuracy on the LiveCodeBench from 46.30% to 57.73% for GPT-4.1-Mini. The
improved accuracy also significantly enhances downstream tasks: the bug
detection rate of GPT4.1-Mini generated test oracles on HumanEval increases
from 90.91% to 95.45% for Nexus compared to baselines, and the success rate of
automated program repair improves from 35.23% to 69.32%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 约束Horn子句（CHCs）被广泛用作各种验证任务的中间表示，包括安全检查、不变式综合和过程间分析。本文旨在探索使用软件验证工具作为CHC求解后端的方法。

Method: 提出CHCVERIF，一个基于组合策略的CHC求解器，采用软件验证方法来解决CHCs，重用成熟的软件验证工具处理CHC基准测试，特别是涉及位向量和低级语义的问题。

Result: 评估显示该方法在线性整数算术上取得中等成功，在位向量基准测试上取得适度成功。结果证明了使用软件验证工具作为CHC求解后端的可行性和潜力。

Conclusion: 使用软件验证工具作为CHC求解后端具有可行性和潜力，特别是在精心构建的组合策略支持下，这种方法在处理位向量和低级语义问题时表现良好。

Abstract: Constrained Horn Clauses (CHCs) are widely adopted as intermediate
representations for a variety of verification tasks, including safety checking,
invariant synthesis, and interprocedural analysis. This paper introduces
CHCVERIF, a portfolio-based CHC solver that adopts a software verification
approach for solving CHCs. This approach enables us to reuse mature software
verification tools to tackle CHC benchmarks, particularly those involving
bitvectors and low-level semantics. Our evaluation shows that while the method
enjoys only moderate success with linear integer arithmetic, it achieves modest
success on bitvector benchmarks. Moreover, our results demonstrate the
viability and potential of using software verification tools as backends for
CHC solving, particularly when supported by a carefully constructed portfolio.

TL;DR: SecureReviewer是一个专门针对安全代码审查的LLM方法，通过构建专用数据集、安全感知微调策略和RAG技术，显著提升了识别和解决安全问题的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化代码审查方法主要关注通用目的，在识别和解决安全相关问题方面效果有限，且面临数据稀缺和评估指标不足的挑战。

Method: 构建安全代码审查专用数据集，采用安全感知微调策略训练LLM，集成RAG技术减少幻觉，并引入SecureBLEU评估指标。

Result: 实验结果显示SecureReviewer在安全漏洞检测准确性和生成审查评论的整体质量及实用性方面均优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: SecureReviewer通过专门的数据集、微调策略和RAG技术，有效提升了LLM在代码审查中识别和解决安全问题的能力，为安全代码审查提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Identifying and addressing security issues during the early phase of the
development lifecycle is critical for mitigating the long-term negative impacts
on software systems. Code review serves as an effective practice that enables
developers to check their teammates' code before integration into the codebase.
To streamline the generation of review comments, various automated code review
approaches have been proposed, where LLM-based methods have significantly
advanced the capabilities of automated review generation. However, existing
models primarily focus on general-purpose code review, their effectiveness in
identifying and addressing security-related issues remains underexplored.
Moreover, adapting existing code review approaches to target security issues
faces substantial challenges, including data scarcity and inadequate evaluation
metrics. To address these limitations, we propose SecureReviewer, a new
approach designed for enhancing LLMs' ability to identify and resolve
security-related issues during code review. Specifically, we first construct a
dataset tailored for training and evaluating secure code review capabilities.
Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune LLMs to generate code review comments
that can effectively identify security issues and provide fix suggestions with
our proposed secure-aware fine-tuning strategy. To mitigate hallucination in
LLMs and enhance the reliability of their outputs, we integrate the RAG
technique, which grounds the generated comments in domain-specific security
knowledge. Additionally, we introduce SecureBLEU, a new evaluation metric
designed to assess the effectiveness of review comments in addressing security
issues. Experimental results demonstrate that SecureReviewer outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both security issue detection accuracy and the
overall quality and practical utility of generated review comments.

TL;DR: 评估5个开源LLM在Python代码提取方法重构任务上的表现，发现RCI提示策略优于单次提示，最佳模型在测试通过率和代码质量方面表现优异，开发者调查显示超过70%接受率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化提取方法重构(EMR)仍然具有挑战性，开源LLM为自动化此类高级任务提供了新方法。

Method: 系统评估5个3B-8B参数的开源LLM，比较单次提示和RCI提示策略，使用自动化指标和开发者调查评估功能正确性和代码质量。

Result: RCI提示在测试通过率和重构质量上表现更好，最佳模型测试通过率分别达到0.829和0.808，显著降低代码行数和圈复杂度，开发者接受率超过70%。

Conclusion: RCI提示策略能有效提升自动化重构质量，但传统指标与人工评估存在差异，需要人机协作评估，开源基准为未来LLM自动化重构研究提供基础。

Abstract: Automating the Extract Method refactoring (EMR) remains challenging and
largely manual despite its importance in improving code readability and
maintainability. Recent advances in open-source, resource-efficient Large
Language Models (LLMs) offer promising new approaches for automating such
high-level tasks. In this work, we critically evaluate five state-of-the-art
open-source LLMs, spanning 3B to 8B parameter sizes, on the EMR task for Python
code. We systematically assess functional correctness and code quality using
automated metrics and investigate the impact of prompting strategies by
comparing one-shot prompting to a Recursive criticism and improvement (RCI)
approach. RCI-based prompting consistently outperforms one-shot prompting in
test pass rates and refactoring quality. The best-performing models,
Deepseek-Coder-RCI and Qwen2.5-Coder-RCI, achieve test pass percentage (TPP)
scores of 0.829 and 0.808, while reducing lines of code (LOC) per method from
12.103 to 6.192 and 5.577, and cyclomatic complexity (CC) from 4.602 to 3.453
and 3.294, respectively. A developer survey on RCI-generated refactorings shows
over 70% acceptance, with Qwen2.5-Coder rated highest across all evaluation
criteria. In contrast, the original code scored below neutral, particularly in
readability and maintainability, underscoring the benefits of automated
refactoring guided by quality prompts. While traditional metrics like CC and
LOC provide useful signals, they often diverge from human judgments,
emphasizing the need for human-in-the-loop evaluation. Our open-source
benchmark offers a foundation for future research on automated refactoring with
LLMs.

Method: 构建自动化数据生成流程：使用LLM合成多样化指令，应用对应代码修改，并进行视觉验证确保正确性，创建Instruct4Edit数据集。

Result: 在Instruct4Edit上微调的模型在将人类意图转化为精确、结构连贯且视觉准确的代码修改方面表现一致提升。

Conclusion: 为基于自然语言的网页编辑提供了可扩展且透明的基础，证明微调较小的开源模型可以达到与专有系统竞争的性能。

Abstract: The evolution of web applications relies on iterative code modifications, a
process that is traditionally manual and time-consuming. While Large Language
Models (LLMs) can generate UI code, their ability to edit existing code from
new design requirements (e.g., "center the logo") remains a challenge. This is
largely due to the absence of large-scale, high-quality tuning data to align
model performance with human expectations. In this paper, we introduce a novel,
automated data generation pipeline that uses LLMs to synthesize a high-quality
fine-tuning dataset for web editing, named Instruct4Edit. Our approach
generates diverse instructions, applies the corresponding code modifications,
and performs visual verification to ensure correctness. By fine-tuning models
on Instruct4Edit, we demonstrate consistent improvement in translating human
intent into precise, structurally coherent, and visually accurate code changes.
This work provides a scalable and transparent foundation for natural language
based web editing, demonstrating that fine-tuning smaller open-source models
can achieve competitive performance with proprietary systems. We release all
data, code implementations, and model checkpoints for reproduction.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The increasing exploitation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled systems
in critical domains has made trustworthiness concerns a paramount showstopper,
requiring verifiable accountability, often by regulation (e.g., the EU AI Act).
Classical software verification and validation techniques, such as procedural
audits, formal methods, or model documentation, are the mechanisms used to
achieve this. However, these methods are either expensive or heavily manual and
ill-suited for the opaque, "black box" nature of most AI models. An intractable
conflict emerges: high auditability and verifiability are required by law, but
such transparency conflicts with the need to protect assets being audited-e.g.,
confidential data and proprietary models-leading to weakened accountability. To
address this challenge, this paper introduces ZKMLOps, a novel MLOps
verification framework that operationalizes Zero-Knowledge Proofs
(ZKPs)-cryptographic protocols allowing a prover to convince a verifier that a
statement is true without revealing additional information-within
Machine-Learning Operations lifecycles. By integrating ZKPs with established
software engineering patterns, ZKMLOps provides a modular and repeatable
process for generating verifiable cryptographic proof of compliance. We
evaluate the framework's practicality through a study of regulatory compliance
in financial risk auditing and assess feasibility through an empirical
evaluation of top ZKP protocols, analyzing performance trade-offs for ML models
of increasing complexity.

Method: 设计了一个满足贝叶斯推断调试框架关键要求的工具，直接在开发环境中提供在线交互式调试功能。

Result: 在18名有经验参与者的研究中，该方法显著减少了推断调试任务的时间和难度。

Conclusion: 所提出的在线交互式贝叶斯推断调试方法能有效降低调试难度和时间，使概率编程更易于使用。

Abstract: Probabilistic programming is a rapidly developing programming paradigm which
enables the formulation of Bayesian models as programs and the automation of
posterior inference. It facilitates the development of models and conducting
Bayesian inference, which makes these techniques available to practitioners
from multiple fields. Nevertheless, probabilistic programming is notoriously
difficult as identifying and repairing issues with inference requires a lot of
time and deep knowledge. Through this work, we introduce a novel approach to
debugging Bayesian inference that reduces time and required knowledge
significantly. We discuss several requirements a Bayesian inference debugging
framework has to fulfill, and propose a new tool that meets these key
requirements directly within the development environment. We evaluate our
results in a study with 18 experienced participants and show that our approach
to online and interactive debugging of Bayesian inference significantly reduces
time and difficulty on inference debugging tasks.

TL;DR: Stitch是一个交互式编程辅导系统，通过逐步引导而非直接展示答案来帮助学习者调试Scratch程序，显著提升学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有调试方法通常直接展示正确答案，虽然能修复错误但削弱了问题解决能力的培养。需要一种能促进学习而非简单修复的方法。

Method: 使用Diff-Analyze模块对比学生项目与参考实现，识别关键差异，用大语言模型解释差异重要性，通过自定义渲染引擎高亮显示，让学生选择性应用部分修复，迭代直到实现预期功能。

Result: 与最先进的自动反馈生成工具相比，Stitch的逐步引导方法在促进有效学习体验方面表现更佳，显著提升了学习成果。

Conclusion: 直接展示正确答案的教学效果不佳，而交互式逐步辅导系统能显著增强学习效果，在积木式编程中提供有效反馈仍是一个开放性问题。

Abstract: Block-based environments such as Scratch are increasingly popular in
programming education. While block syntax reduces surface errors, semantic bugs
remain common and challenging for novices to resolve. Existing debugging
workflows typically show the correct program directly to learners, a strategy
that may fix errors but undermines the development of problem-solving skills.
  We present Stitch, an interactive tutoring system that replaces "showing the
answer" with step-by-step scaffolding. The system's Diff-Analyze module
contrasts a student's project with a reference implementation, identifies the
most critical differences, and uses a large language model to explain why these
changes matter. Learners inspect highlighted blocks through a custom rendering
engine, understand the explanations, and selectively apply partial fixes. This
iterative process continues until the intended functionality is achieved.
  We evaluate Stitch in an empirical study, comparing it against a
state-of-the-art automated feedback generation tool for Scratch. Our key
insight is that simply presenting the correct program is pedagogically
ineffective. In contrast, our interactive, step-by-step guided system promotes
a more effective learning experience. More broadly, what constitutes effective
feedback in block-based programming remains an open question. Our evaluation
provides new evidence that step-by-step tutoring significantly enhances
learning outcomes, outperforming both direct-answer approaches and current
automated feedback generation tools.

TL;DR: 该研究通过分析ImageMagick项目中76个漏洞重新引入案例，发现过程指标（如问题腐败度和问题密度）与漏洞重新引入密切相关，强调漏洞重新引入是累积开发活动和社会技术条件的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件漏洞即使在修复后仍会持续存在或重新出现，现有研究很少探索过程指标是否能揭示随时间推移的风险开发活动，这对于预测和缓解软件漏洞至关重要。

Method: 在ImageMagick项目中进行案例研究，将纵向过程指标（总线因子、问题密度、问题腐败度）与漏洞重新引入活动相关联，分析提交级别的安全修复，关注漏洞演化和重新出现的变更序列。

Result: 研究发现重新引入通常与增加的问题腐败度和波动的问题密度相一致，反映了问题管理和团队响应能力的短期低效。

Conclusion: 过程指标与代码指标结合可以为预测风险修复和加强软件安全提供基础，漏洞重新引入很少是孤立行动的结果，而是源于累积开发活动和社会技术条件。

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities often persist or re-emerge even after being fixed,
revealing the complex interplay between code evolution and socio-technical
factors. While source code metrics provide useful indicators of
vulnerabilities, software engineering process metrics can uncover patterns that
lead to their introduction. Yet few studies have explored whether process
metrics can reveal risky development activities over time -- insights that are
essential for anticipating and mitigating software vulnerabilities. This work
highlights the critical role of process metrics along with code changes in
understanding and mitigating vulnerability reintroduction. We move beyond
file-level prediction and instead analyze security fixes at the commit level,
focusing not only on whether a single fix introduces a vulnerability but also
on the longer sequences of changes through which vulnerabilities evolve and
re-emerge. Our approach emphasizes that reintroduction is rarely the result of
one isolated action, but emerges from cumulative development activities and
socio-technical conditions. To support this analysis, we conducted a case study
on the ImageMagick project by correlating longitudinal process metrics such as
bus factor, issue density, and issue spoilage with vulnerability reintroduction
activities, encompassing 76 instances of reintroduced vulnerabilities. Our
findings show that reintroductions often align with increased issue spoilage
and fluctuating issue density, reflecting short-term inefficiencies in issue
management and team responsiveness. These observations provide a foundation for
broader studies that combine process and code metrics to predict risky fixes
and strengthen software security.

*Aylton Almeida,Laerte Xavier,Marco Tulio Valente*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 评估使用GitHub Copilot Agent Mode自动化迁移SQLAlchemy库版本的效果，该代理在API迁移方面表现良好（迁移覆盖率100%），但在保持应用功能方面表现不佳（测试通过率39.75%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件系统更新对于避免技术债务、安全漏洞和遗留系统僵化至关重要，但更新过程耗时且容易出错。大型语言模型和代理编码系统为自动化此类维护任务提供了新机会。

Method: 使用GitHub的Copilot Agent Mode（一种能够规划和执行多步骤迁移工作流的自主AI系统），在十个客户端应用数据集中评估SQLAlchemy库的更新。引入迁移覆盖率指标来量化正确迁移的API使用点比例。

Result: LLM代理能够迁移SQLAlchemy版本间的功能和API使用（迁移覆盖率中位数为100%），但未能保持应用功能，导致测试通过率较低（中位数为39.75%）。

Conclusion: 虽然LLM代理在API迁移方面表现出色，但在保持应用整体功能方面存在局限性，表明自动化迁移工具需要进一步改进以确保功能完整性。

Abstract: Keeping software systems up to date is essential to avoid technical debt,
security vulnerabilities, and the rigidity typical of legacy systems. However,
updating libraries and frameworks remains a time consuming and error-prone
process. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic coding
systems offer new opportunities for automating such maintenance tasks. In this
paper, we evaluate the update of a well-known Python library, SQLAlchemy,
across a dataset of ten client applications. For this task, we use the Github's
Copilot Agent Mode, an autonomous AI systema capable of planning and executing
multi-step migration workflows. To assess the effectiveness of the automated
migration, we also introduce Migration Coverage, a metric that quantifies the
proportion of API usage points correctly migrated. The results of our study
show that the LLM agent was capable of migrating functionalities and API usages
between SQLAlchemy versions (migration coverage: 100%, median), but failed to
maintain the application functionality, leading to a low test-pass rate
(39.75%, median).

TL;DR: 该论文对语法和语义日志解析器进行实证研究，发现语义方法在模板识别上更准确，语法方法效率更高但模板识别不足。基于研究结果提出了SynLog+模块，显著提升解析准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日志解析是自动化日志分析的第一步，但现有解析器采用不同技术，需要评估其特性和性能以指导选择和改进。

Method: 进行全面的实证研究，比较语法和语义日志解析器，以及单阶段和两阶段解析架构。基于研究发现提出SynLog+模板识别模块。

Result: 语义方法在正确模板识别上表现更好，语法解析器效率高10-1000倍但模板识别不足。两阶段架构相比单阶段持续提升准确率。SynLog+使语法和语义解析器准确率分别提升236%和20%。

Conclusion: 两阶段解析架构能有效提升日志解析准确率，SynLog+模块在不增加运行时成本的情况下显著改善现有解析器的性能。

Abstract: Logs provide valuable insights into system runtime and assist in software
development and maintenance. Log parsing, which converts semi-structured log
data into structured log data, is often the first step in automated log
analysis. Given the wide range of log parsers utilizing diverse techniques, it
is essential to evaluate them to understand their characteristics and
performance. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study
comparing syntax- and semantic-based log parsers, as well as single-phase and
two-phase parsing architectures. Our experiments reveal that semantic-based
methods perform better at identifying the correct templates and syntax-based
log parsers are 10 to 1,000 times more efficient and provide better grouping
accuracy although they fall short in accurate template identification.
Moreover, two-phase architecture consistently improves accuracy compared to
single-phase architecture. Based on the findings of this study, we propose
SynLog+, a template identification module that acts as the second phase in a
two-phase log parsing architecture. SynLog+ improves the parsing accuracy of
syntax-based and semantic-based log parsers by 236\% and 20\% on average,
respectively, with virtually no additional runtime cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs作为传统多层感知机(MLPs)的有前景替代方案，具有更好的表达能力和可解释性，需要对其快速发展领域进行系统梳理。

Method: 通过收集和分类大量开源实现，建立KANs与MLPs的概念联系，分析不同基函数选择的权衡，并总结提高精度、效率和正则化的技术路线图。

Conclusion: KANs在参数效率和表达能力方面优于传统MLPs，本文为研究人员和从业者提供了实用的架构选择指南，并指出了当前研究空白。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), inspired by the
Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Unlike MLPs, which use fixed
activation functions on nodes, KANs employ learnable univariate basis functions
on edges, offering enhanced expressivity and interpretability. This review
provides a systematic and comprehensive overview of the rapidly expanding KAN
landscape, moving beyond simple performance comparisons to offer a structured
synthesis of theoretical foundations, architectural variants, and practical
implementation strategies. By collecting and categorizing a vast array of
open-source implementations, we map the vibrant ecosystem supporting KAN
development. We begin by bridging the conceptual gap between KANs and MLPs,
establishing their formal equivalence and highlighting the superior parameter
efficiency of the KAN formulation. A central theme of our review is the
critical role of the basis function; we survey a wide array of choices,
including B-splines, Chebyshev and Jacobi polynomials, ReLU compositions,
Gaussian RBFs, and Fourier series, and analyze their respective trade-offs in
terms of smoothness, locality, and computational cost. We then categorize
recent advancements into a clear roadmap, covering techniques for improving
accuracy, efficiency, and regularization. Key topics include physics-informed
loss design, adaptive sampling, domain decomposition, hybrid architectures, and
specialized methods for handling discontinuities. Finally, we provide a
practical "Choose-Your-KAN" guide to help practitioners select appropriate
architectures, and we conclude by identifying current research gaps. The
associated GitHub repository https://github.com/AmirNoori68/kan-review
complements this paper and serves as a structured reference for ongoing KAN
research.

TL;DR: HiMAE是一个分层掩码自编码器框架，通过多分辨率嵌入来探索可穿戴传感器数据中不同时间尺度的重要性，在保持高效性的同时优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可穿戴传感器提供了丰富的生理时间序列数据，但预测效用的基本原则尚不清楚。作者假设时间分辨率是表示学习的基本轴，不同的临床和行为结果依赖于不同尺度的结构。

Method: 引入HiMAE（分层掩码自编码器），这是一个自监督框架，将掩码自编码与分层卷积编码器-解码器相结合，生成多分辨率嵌入。

Result: 在分类、回归和生成基准测试中，HiMAE始终优于忽略尺度信息的现有基础模型，同时模型规模小几个数量级，能够在智能手表CPU上实现亚毫秒级推理。

Conclusion: HiMAE既是一种高效的自监督学习方法，也是发现可穿戴健康数据中尺度敏感结构的发现工具。

Abstract: Wearable sensors provide abundant physiological time series, yet the
principles governing their predictive utility remain unclear. We hypothesize
that temporal resolution is a fundamental axis of representation learning, with
different clinical and behavioral outcomes relying on structure at distinct
scales. To test this resolution hypothesis, we introduce HiMAE (Hierarchical
Masked Autoencoder), a self supervised framework that combines masked
autoencoding with a hierarchical convolutional encoder decoder. HiMAE produces
multi resolution embeddings that enable systematic evaluation of which temporal
scales carry predictive signal, transforming resolution from a hyperparameter
into a probe for interpretability. Across classification, regression, and
generative benchmarks, HiMAE consistently outperforms state of the art
foundation models that collapse scale, while being orders of magnitude smaller.
HiMAE is an efficient representation learner compact enough to run entirely on
watch, achieving sub millisecond inference on smartwatch class CPUs for true
edge inference. Together, these contributions position HiMAE as both an
efficient self supervised learning method and a discovery tool for scale
sensitive structure in wearable health.

Abstract: High-energy materials (HEMs) are critical for propulsion and defense domains,
yet their discovery remains constrained by experimental data and restricted
access to testing facilities. This work presents a novel approach toward
high-energy molecules by combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for
molecular generation and Attentive Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for property
predictions. We propose a transformative embedding space construction strategy
that integrates fixed SHA-256 embeddings with partially trainable
representations. Unlike conventional regularization techniques, this changes
the representational basis itself, reshaping the molecular input space before
learning begins. Without recourse to pretraining, the generator achieves 67.5%
validity and 37.5% novelty. The generated library exhibits a mean Tanimoto
coefficient of 0.214 relative to training set signifying the ability of
framework to generate a diverse chemical space. We identified 37 new super

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了思维链监督对Transformer学习动态的影响，发现在符号推理任务中，CoT能加速泛化但无法克服高算法复杂度任务，并揭示了训练过程中出现的暂时性推理不忠实现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管思维链监督能显著提升Transformer性能，但模型如何学习遵循和受益于CoT的机制尚不清楚。本文旨在通过可控的符号推理任务研究这些学习动态。

Method: 在符号推理任务上预训练Transformer，通过调整算法复杂度和数据组成来研究泛化。设置两种训练方式：(i)仅输出最终答案，(ii)在回答前输出显式CoT轨迹。使用三参数逻辑曲线对训练动态进行建模。

Result: CoT通常能提升任务性能，但其效果取决于任务复杂度。发现训练早期存在暂时性推理不忠实阶段，模型能给出正确答案但跳过或违背CoT步骤。CoT改变了Transformer的内部计算机制。

Conclusion: CoT加速了泛化过程但无法克服高算法复杂度任务，推理忠实性是训练过程中动态出现的特性，CoT机制性地改变了Transformer的内部计算方式。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision can substantially improve transformer
performance, yet the mechanisms by which models learn to follow and benefit
from CoT remain poorly understood. We investigate these learning dynamics
through the lens of grokking by pretraining transformers on symbolic reasoning
tasks with tunable algorithmic complexity and controllable data composition to
study their generalization. Models were trained under two settings: (i)
producing only final answers, and (ii) emitting explicit CoT traces before
answering. Our results show that while CoT generally improves task performance,
its benefits depend on task complexity. To quantify these effects, we model the
accuracy of the logarithmic training steps with a three-parameter logistic
curve, revealing how the learning speed and shape vary with task complexity,
data distribution, and the presence of CoT supervision. We also uncover a
transient trace unfaithfulness phase: early in training, models often produce
correct answers while skipping or contradicting CoT steps, before later
aligning their reasoning traces with answers. Empirically, we (1) demonstrate
that CoT accelerates generalization but does not overcome tasks with higher
algorithmic complexity, such as finding list intersections; (2) introduce a
kinetic modeling framework for understanding transformer learning; (3)
characterize trace faithfulness as a dynamic property that emerges over
training; and (4) show CoT alters internal transformer computation
mechanistically.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个理论框架来分析多智能体系统中的系统性偏差，引入了可学习性比率的概念来判断偏差学习是否值得，并开发了ABLOC算法来迭代学习偏差校正变换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代多智能体系统（如传感器网络和众包平台）会因环境条件变化而产生系统性偏差，导致性能显著下降。现有方法要么忽略这些偏差导致次优决策，要么需要昂贵的校准程序。

Method: 开发了一个理论框架，将偏差分解为可学习的系统性成分和不可约的随机成分，引入可学习性比率概念。提出了ABLOC算法，通过迭代学习偏差校正变换和优化组合权重来逼近理论界限。

Result: 实验验证表明，具有高可学习性比率的系统可以恢复显著性能（在示例中实现了理论最大改进的40%-70%），而低可学习性比率的系统获益甚微。

Conclusion: 可学习性比率决定了偏差学习是否值得投资，为系统设计者提供了何时投资偏差学习与采用更简单方法的定量指导。

Abstract: Modern multi-agent systems ranging from sensor networks monitoring critical
infrastructure to crowdsourcing platforms aggregating human intelligence can
suffer significant performance degradation due to systematic biases that vary
with environmental conditions. Current approaches either ignore these biases,
leading to suboptimal decisions, or require expensive calibration procedures
that are often infeasible in practice. This performance gap has real
consequences: inaccurate environmental monitoring, unreliable financial
predictions, and flawed aggregation of human judgments. This paper addresses
the fundamental question: when can we learn and correct for these unknown
biases to recover near-optimal performance, and when is such learning futile?
We develop a theoretical framework that decomposes biases into learnable
systematic components and irreducible stochastic components, introducing the
concept of learnability ratio as the fraction of bias variance predictable from
observable covariates. This ratio determines whether bias learning is
worthwhile for a given system. We prove that the achievable performance
improvement is fundamentally bounded by this learnability ratio, providing
system designers with quantitative guidance on when to invest in bias learning
versus simpler approaches. We present the Adaptive Bias Learning and Optimal
Combining (ABLOC) algorithm, which iteratively learns bias-correcting
transformations while optimizing combination weights through closedform
solutions, guaranteeing convergence to these theoretical bounds. Experimental
validation demonstrates that systems with high learnability ratios can recover
significant performance (we achieved 40%-70% of theoretical maximum improvement
in our examples), while those with low learnability show minimal benefit,
validating our diagnostic criteria for practical deployment decisions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于模拟的强化学习方法来解决拼车系统中的短视决策问题，通过时空状态值学习和车辆再平衡策略，显著提升了服务率并减少了乘客等待时间和车队规模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 拼车服务虽然能降低成本和环境影响，但现有系统存在短视决策问题，忽略了调度决策的长期影响。

Method: 将Xu等人(2018)的学习规划框架从网约车扩展到拼车系统，在机制中嵌入拼车模拟以实现非短视决策，并提出空闲车辆再平衡策略，使用n步时序差分学习从模拟经验中推导时空状态值。

Result: 非短视匹配策略可将服务率提高8.4%，减少乘客车内和等待时间，车队规模可减少25%以上。加入再平衡操作后，等待时间减少27.3%，车内时间减少12.5%，服务率提高15.1%。

Conclusion: 所提出的非短视策略能显著提升拼车系统性能，为运营商带来显著成本节约，但会增加每乘客车辆行驶时间。

Abstract: Ride-pooling, also known as ride-sharing, shared ride-hailing, or
microtransit, is a service wherein passengers share rides. This service can
reduce costs for both passengers and operators and reduce congestion and
environmental impacts. A key limitation, however, is its myopic
decision-making, which overlooks long-term effects of dispatch decisions. To
address this, we propose a simulation-informed reinforcement learning (RL)
approach. While RL has been widely studied in the context of ride-hailing
systems, its application in ride-pooling systems has been less explored. In
this study, we extend the learning and planning framework of Xu et al. (2018)
from ride-hailing to ride-pooling by embedding a ride-pooling simulation within
the learning mechanism to enable non-myopic decision-making. In addition, we
propose a complementary policy for rebalancing idle vehicles. By employing
n-step temporal difference learning on simulated experiences, we derive
spatiotemporal state values and subsequently evaluate the effectiveness of the
non-myopic policy using NYC taxi request data. Results demonstrate that the
non-myopic policy for matching can increase the service rate by up to 8.4%
versus a myopic policy while reducing both in-vehicle and wait times for
passengers. Furthermore, the proposed non-myopic policy can decrease fleet size
by over 25% compared to a myopic policy, while maintaining the same level of
performance, thereby offering significant cost savings for operators.
Incorporating rebalancing operations into the proposed framework cuts wait time
by up to 27.3%, in-vehicle time by 12.5%, and raises service rate by 15.1%
compared to using the framework for matching decisions alone at the cost of
increased vehicle minutes traveled per passenger.

Conclusion: MemEIC成功解决了LVLMs中多模态知识持续编辑的挑战，通过组合编辑方法实现了更好的知识更新效果。

Abstract: The dynamic nature of information necessitates continuously updating large
vision-language models (LVLMs). While recent knowledge editing techniques hint
at promising directions, they often focus on editing a single modality (vision
or language) in isolation. This prevalent practice neglects the inherent
multimodality of LVLMs and the continuous nature of knowledge updates,
potentially leading to suboptimal editing outcomes when considering the
interplay between modalities and the need for ongoing knowledge refinement. To
address these limitations, we propose MemEIC, a novel method for Continual and
Compositional Knowledge Editing (CCKE) in LVLMs. MemEIC enables compositional
editing of both visual and textual knowledge sequentially. Our approach employs
a hybrid external-internal editor featuring a dual external memory for
cross-modal evidence retrieval and dual LoRA adapters that facilitate
disentangled parameter updates for each modality. A key component is a
brain-inspired knowledge connector, activated selectively for compositional
reasoning, that integrates information across different modalities. Experiments
demonstrate that MemEIC significantly improves performance on complex
multimodal questions and effectively preserves prior edits, setting a new
benchmark for CCKE in LVLMs.

Method: 通过大量实证实验测量现有主流模型中的频谱偏差，并提出FreLE（频率损失增强）算法，通过显式和隐式频率正则化来增强模型泛化能力。这是一个即插即用的模型损失函数单元。

Result: 研究发现几乎所有模型都表现出频谱偏差现象。大量实验证明FreLE具有优越性能。

Conclusion: 频谱偏差是时间序列预测模型中的普遍现象，FreLE算法能有效缓解其影响，提升模型性能。

Abstract: The inherent autocorrelation of time series data presents an ongoing
challenge to multivariate time series prediction. Recently, a widely adopted
approach has been the incorporation of frequency domain information to assist
in long-term prediction tasks. Many researchers have independently observed the
spectral bias phenomenon in neural networks, where models tend to fit
low-frequency signals before high-frequency ones. However, these observations
have often been attributed to the specific architectures designed by the
researchers, rather than recognizing the phenomenon as a universal
characteristic across models. To unify the understanding of the spectral bias
phenomenon in long-term time series prediction, we conducted extensive
empirical experiments to measure spectral bias in existing mainstream models.
Our findings reveal that virtually all models exhibit this phenomenon. To
mitigate the impact of spectral bias, we propose the FreLE (Frequency Loss
Enhancement) algorithm, which enhances model generalization through both
explicit and implicit frequency regularization. This is a plug-and-play model
loss function unit. A large number of experiments have proven the superior
performance of FreLE. Code is available at

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has recently catalyzed a
wave of "MLLM-r1" approaches that bring RL to vision language models. Most
representative paradigms begin with a cold start, typically employing
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to initialize the policy before RL. However,
SFT-based cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task
solution and output format, which may induce instruction-style overfitting,
weakens out-of-distribution generalization, and ultimately affects downstream
RL. We revisit the cold start along two views, its training method and data
construction, and introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) coefficient to
quantify the generalization capability under different methods. Our empirical
study finds that preference-based training methods (e.g. DPO) generalizes
better than SFT-based methods in cold start. Motivated by this, we propose
SPECS-a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework that decouples
multimodal learning: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via
self-distillation, avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation;
(2) performs preference-based training to learn, focusing on shallow,
transferable surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) rather than
memorizing content; and (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep
reasoning results. Experimental results across multiple multimodal benchmarks
show that our decoupling learning framework yields consistent performance gains
over strong baselines, improving MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%.
Additional experiments indicate that SPECS contributes to reducing
in-distribution "stuckness," improving exploration, stabilizing training, and
raising the performance ceiling.

Abstract: Robotic systems operating at the edge require efficient online learning
algorithms that can continuously adapt to changing environments while
processing streaming sensory data. Traditional backpropagation, while
effective, conflicts with biological plausibility principles and may be
suboptimal for continuous adaptation scenarios. The Predictive Coding (PC)
framework offers a biologically plausible alternative with local, Hebbian-like
update rules, making it suitable for neuromorphic hardware implementation.
However, PC's main limitation is its computational overhead due to multiple
inference iterations during training. We present Predictive Coding Network with
Temporal Amortization (PCN-TA), which preserves latent states across temporal
frames. By leveraging temporal correlations, PCN-TA significantly reduces
computational demands while maintaining learning performance. Our experiments
on the COIL-20 robotic perception dataset demonstrate that PCN-TA achieves 10%
fewer weight updates compared to backpropagation and requires 50% fewer
inference steps than baseline PC networks. These efficiency gains directly
translate to reduced computational overhead for moving another step toward edge
deployment and real-time adaptation support in resource-constrained robotic
systems. The biologically-inspired nature of our approach also makes it a
promising candidate for future neuromorphic hardware implementations, enabling
efficient online learning at the edge.

to high errors in mixed training. Additionally, dense pre-training models that
scale parameters by increasing network width or depth incur significant
inference costs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel
Mixture-of-Experts Pre-training Operator Transformer (MoE-POT), a
sparse-activated architecture that scales parameters efficiently while
controlling inference costs. Specifically, our model adopts a layer-wise
router-gating network to dynamically select 4 routed experts from 16 expert
networks during inference, enabling the model to focus on equation-specific
features. Meanwhile, we also integrate 2 shared experts, aiming to capture
common properties of PDE and reduce redundancy among routed experts. The final
output is computed as the weighted average of the results from all activated
experts. We pre-train models with parameters from 30M to 0.5B on 6 public PDE
datasets. Our model with 90M activated parameters achieves up to a 40%
reduction in zero-shot error compared with existing models with 120M activated
parameters. Additionally, we conduct interpretability analysis, showing that
dataset types can be inferred from router-gating network decisions, which
validates the rationality and effectiveness of the MoE architecture.

*Jaewon Chu,Seunghun Lee,Hyunwoo J. Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRESTO是一个针对黑盒大语言模型的指令优化框架，通过利用软提示的前像结构来提高优化效率，在相同查询预算下实现14倍的数据评分效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 黑盒LLM的指令优化面临查询冗余问题，传统方法将软提示到指令的多对一映射视为效率障碍，而本文将其重新解释为可加速优化的先验知识。

Method: PRESTO框架包含三个核心组件：评分共享、基于前像的初始化和评分一致性正则化，通过利用软提示的前像结构来减少冗余查询。

Result: 在33个指令优化任务上的实验结果表明，PRESTO表现出优越性能，在相同查询预算下有效获得14倍多的评分数据。

Conclusion: PRESTO成功证明了重新解释软提示到指令的多对一映射为有用先验知识，能够显著提升黑盒LLM指令优化的效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
domains, due to their strong instruction-following capabilities. This has led
to increasing interest in optimizing instructions for black-box LLMs, whose
internal parameters are inaccessible but widely used due to their strong
performance. To optimize instructions for black-box LLMs, recent methods employ
white-box LLMs to generate candidate instructions from optimized soft prompts.
However, white-box LLMs often map different soft prompts to the same
instruction, leading to redundant queries. While previous studies regarded this
many-to-one mapping as a structure that hinders optimization efficiency, we
reinterpret it as a useful prior knowledge that can accelerate the
optimization. To this end, we introduce PREimage-informed inSTruction
Optimization (PRESTO), a novel framework that leverages the preimage structure
of soft prompts for efficient optimization. PRESTO consists of three key
components: (1) score sharing, which shares the evaluation score with all soft
prompts in a preimage; (2) preimage-based initialization, which selects initial
data points that maximize search space coverage using preimage information; and
(3) score consistency regularization, which enforces prediction consistency
within each preimage. By leveraging preimages, PRESTO achieves the effect of
effectively obtaining 14 times more scored data under the same query budget,
resulting in more efficient optimization. Experimental results on 33
instruction optimization tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PRESTO.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ScaleDiff是一个无需训练的高效框架，通过Neighborhood Patch Attention和Latent Frequency Mixing技术，扩展预训练扩散模型的分辨率，在图像质量和推理速度上达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型在生成超出训练分辨率的图像时性能下降，现有免训练方法计算量大且不兼容Diffusion Transformer模型。

Method: 提出Neighborhood Patch Attention减少自注意力层计算冗余，结合SDEdit流程和Latent Frequency Mixing生成细节，使用Structure Guidance增强全局结构。

Result: 实验结果显示ScaleDiff在U-Net和Diffusion Transformer架构上，图像质量和推理速度均达到免训练方法的最先进水平。

Conclusion: ScaleDiff是一个模型无关的高效框架，无需额外训练即可扩展预训练扩散模型的分辨率，兼容多种架构且性能优异。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models often exhibit degraded performance when
generating images beyond their training resolution. Recent training-free
methods can mitigate this limitation, but they often require substantial
computation or are incompatible with recent Diffusion Transformer models. In
this paper, we propose ScaleDiff, a model-agnostic and highly efficient
framework for extending the resolution of pretrained diffusion models without
any additional training. A core component of our framework is Neighborhood
Patch Attention (NPA), an efficient mechanism that reduces computational
redundancy in the self-attention layer with non-overlapping patches. We
integrate NPA into an SDEdit pipeline and introduce Latent Frequency Mixing
(LFM) to better generate fine details. Furthermore, we apply Structure Guidance
to enhance global structure during the denoising process. Experimental results
demonstrate that ScaleDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance among
training-free methods in terms of both image quality and inference speed on
both U-Net and Diffusion Transformer architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了MedVLSynther框架，通过生成-验证机制从开放生物医学文献合成高质量医学视觉问答数据，创建了包含13,087个问题的MedSynVQA数据集，训练的开源大模型在多个医学VQA基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练通用医学VQA系统面临高质量开放数据集的缺乏，需要一种可扩展的方法来生成高质量的医学视觉问答训练数据。

Method: 采用基于规则的生成-验证框架，从PubMed Central文献中基于图像、标题和文本引用生成多选题VQA项目，包含多阶段验证器确保问题质量。

Result: 生成了MedSynVQA数据集（13,087个问题，14,803张图像），训练的开源LMM在6个医学VQA基准测试中平均准确率达到55.85（3B）和58.15（7B），在VQA-RAD和PathVQA上分别达到77.57和67.76。

Conclusion: MedVLSynther提供了一条可审计、可复制且保护隐私的路径，用于扩展医学VQA训练数据，完全基于开放文献和开源模型。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly capable of answering medical
questions that require joint reasoning over images and text, yet training
general medical VQA systems is impeded by the lack of large, openly usable,
high-quality corpora. We present MedVLSynther, a rubric-guided
generator-verifier framework that synthesizes high-quality multiple-choice VQA
items directly from open biomedical literature by conditioning on figures,
captions, and in-text references. The generator produces self-contained stems
and parallel, mutually exclusive options under a machine-checkable JSON schema;
a multi-stage verifier enforces essential gates (self-containment, single
correct answer, clinical validity, image-text consistency), awards fine-grained
positive points, and penalizes common failure modes before acceptance. Applying
this pipeline to PubMed Central yields MedSynVQA: 13,087 audited questions over
14,803 images spanning 13 imaging modalities and 28 anatomical regions.
Training open-weight LMMs with reinforcement learning using verifiable rewards
improves accuracy across six medical VQA benchmarks, achieving averages of
55.85 (3B) and 58.15 (7B), with up to 77.57 on VQA-RAD and 67.76 on PathVQA,
outperforming strong medical LMMs. A Ablations verify that both generation and
verification are necessary and that more verified data consistently helps, and
a targeted contamination analysis detects no leakage from evaluation suites. By
operating entirely on open literature and open-weight models, MedVLSynther
offers an auditable, reproducible, and privacy-preserving path to scalable
medical VQA training data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: π_RL是一个开源框架，用于在并行仿真中训练基于流的视觉-语言-动作模型，通过两种强化学习算法解决了迭代去噪过程中动作对数似然计算困难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管最近工作探索使用强化学习来自动化监督微调的数据收集过程，但由于迭代去噪导致的动作对数似然难以计算，将大规模RL应用于基于流的VLA模型仍然具有挑战性。

Method: π_RL实现了两种RL算法：(1) Flow-Noise将去噪过程建模为离散时间MDP，使用可学习的噪声网络进行精确对数似然计算；(2) Flow-SDE将去噪与智能体-环境交互集成，构建双层MDP，采用ODE-to-SDE转换实现高效RL探索。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，π_RL将少样本SFT模型π_0和π_0.5的性能分别从57.6%提升到97.6%和从77.1%提升到98.3%。在ManiSkill中，在320个并行环境中训练，将π_0从41.6%提升到85.7%，π_0.5从40.0%提升到84.8%，覆盖4352个拾取放置任务。

Conclusion: π_RL实现了显著的性能提升和比SFT模型更强的泛化能力，验证了在线强化学习对于基于流的VLA模型的有效性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable robots to understand and perform
complex tasks from multimodal input. Although recent work explores using
reinforcement learning (RL) to automate the laborious data collection process
in scaling supervised fine-tuning (SFT), applying large-scale RL to flow-based
VLAs (e.g., $\pi_0$, $\pi_{0.5}$) remains challenging due to intractable action
log-likelihoods from iterative denoising.
  We address this challenge with $\pi_{\text{RL}}$, an open-source framework
for training flow-based VLAs in parallel simulation. $\pi_{\text{RL}}$
implements two RL algorithms: (1) {Flow-Noise} models the denoising process as
a discrete-time MDP with a learnable noise network for exact log-likelihood
computation. (2) {Flow-SDE} integrates denoising with agent-environment
interaction, formulating a two-layer MDP that employs ODE-to-SDE conversion for
efficient RL exploration.
  We evaluate $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ on LIBERO and ManiSkill benchmarks. On LIBERO,
$\pi_{\text{RL}}$ boosts few-shot SFT models $\pi_0$ and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 57.6%
to 97.6% and from 77.1% to 98.3%, respectively. In ManiSkill, we train
$\pi_{\text{RL}}$ in 320 parallel environments, improving $\pi_0$ from 41.6% to
85.7% and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 40.0% to 84.8% across 4352 pick-and-place tasks,
demonstrating scalable multitask RL under heterogeneous simulation.
  Overall, $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ achieves significant performance gains and
stronger generalization over SFT-models, validating the effectiveness of online
RL for flow-based VLAs.

Motivation: 解决稀缺标签预算下探索与利用的核心挑战，替代手动调整的启发式方法

Method: 基于平衡福尔曼曲率的核心集构建算法指导探索，包含数据驱动的停止准则；使用BFC动态触发从探索到利用的转换；引入局部图重连策略整合多尺度信息

Result: 在基准分类任务实验中，方法在低标签率下持续优于现有图半监督基线

Conclusion: 图拓扑方法能有效解决主动学习中的探索-利用平衡问题，在有限标签下实现更好性能

Abstract: We propose a graph-topological approach to active learning that directly
targets the core challenge of exploration versus exploitation under scarce
label budgets. To guide exploration, we introduce a coreset construction
algorithm based on Balanced Forman Curvature (BFC), which selects
representative initial labels that reflect the graph's cluster structure. This
method includes a data-driven stopping criterion that signals when the graph
has been sufficiently explored. We further use BFC to dynamically trigger the
shift from exploration to exploitation within active learning routines,
replacing hand-tuned heuristics. To improve exploitation, we introduce a
localized graph rewiring strategy that efficiently incorporates multiscale
information around labeled nodes, enhancing label propagation while preserving
sparsity. Experiments on benchmark classification tasks show that our methods
consistently outperform existing graph-based semi-supervised baselines at low
label rates.

Motivation: 在多域环境中估计因果效应面临未观测混杂因子和域间效应变化的挑战，需要利用代理变量来解决识别问题。

Conclusion: 该方法在存在未观测混杂因子和域间效应变化的情况下，能够可靠地估计目标域的因果效应，并提供了置信区间。

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating a causal effect in a multi-domain
setting. The causal effect of interest is confounded by an unobserved
confounder and can change between the different domains. We assume that we have
access to a proxy of the hidden confounder and that all variables are discrete
or categorical. We propose methodology to estimate the causal effect in the
target domain, where we assume to observe only the proxy variable. Under these
conditions, we prove identifiability (even when treatment and response
variables are continuous). We introduce two estimation techniques, prove
consistency, and derive confidence intervals. The theoretical results are
supported by simulation studies and a real-world example studying the causal
effect of website rankings on consumer choices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主动学习方法在处理混乱、未整理的数据池时效果有限，因为它们依赖固定的无监督表示，无法捕捉与目标任务相关的信息。

Method: 提出两种策略：1）直接学习半监督表示；2）在初始无监督表示基础上进行监督微调，并在主动学习过程中定期更新表示。

Result: 两种策略都显著优于使用无监督或预训练表示的方法，提升了实证性能。

Conclusion: 任务驱动的动态表示更新是提升主动学习在混乱数据池中有效性的关键方法。

Abstract: Active learning has the potential to be especially useful for messy,
uncurated pools where datapoints vary in relevance to the target task. However,
state-of-the-art approaches to this problem currently rely on using fixed,
unsupervised representations of the pool, focusing on modifying the acquisition
function instead. We show that this model setup can undermine their
effectiveness at dealing with messy pools, as such representations can fail to
capture important information relevant to the task. To address this, we propose
using task-driven representations that are periodically updated during the
active learning process using the previously collected labels. We introduce two
specific strategies for learning these representations, one based on directly
learning semi-supervised representations and the other based on supervised
fine-tuning of an initial unsupervised representation. We find that both
significantly improve empirical performance over using unsupervised or
pretrained representations.

TL;DR: InvGNN-WM是一种无触发器的图神经网络水印方法，通过模型对图不变量的隐式感知来验证所有权，在保持任务性能的同时提供黑盒验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN水印方法依赖后门触发器，容易受到常见模型编辑的影响并产生所有权模糊问题，需要更鲁棒的水印方案。

Method: 使用轻量级头部预测所有者私有载体集上的归一化代数连通性，通过符号敏感解码器输出比特，并用校准阈值控制误报率。

Result: 在各种节点和图分类数据集及骨干网络上，InvGNN-WM在保持清洁准确率的同时，比基于触发器和压缩的基线方法获得更高的水印准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法在非结构化剪枝、微调和训练后量化下保持强健，普通知识蒸馏会削弱水印，但结合水印损失的知识蒸馏可以恢复水印，且精确移除是NP完全问题。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are valuable intellectual property, yet many
watermarks rely on backdoor triggers that break under common model edits and
create ownership ambiguity. We present InvGNN-WM, which ties ownership to a
model's implicit perception of a graph invariant, enabling trigger-free,
black-box verification with negligible task impact. A lightweight head predicts
normalized algebraic connectivity on an owner-private carrier set; a
sign-sensitive decoder outputs bits, and a calibrated threshold controls the
false-positive rate. Across diverse node and graph classification datasets and
backbones, InvGNN-WM matches clean accuracy while yielding higher watermark
accuracy than trigger- and compression-based baselines. It remains strong under
unstructured pruning, fine-tuning, and post-training quantization; plain
knowledge distillation (KD) weakens the mark, while KD with a watermark loss
(KD+WM) restores it. We provide guarantees for imperceptibility and robustness,
and we prove that exact removal is NP-complete.

Motivation: 传统哈希或one-hot编码无法保持双射映射，MLT旨在提供可逆、可控维度的编码方法。

Method: 利用有限域上的模运算和可逆线性变换，实现确定性的可逆编码。

Result: 在MovieLens 20M数据集上，MLT达到与监督嵌入相当的预测性能，但参数更少、训练成本更低。

Conclusion: MLT提供了一种高效、可逆的高基数分类变量编码方案，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: This paper introduces Modular Linear Tokenization (MLT), a reversible and
deterministic technique for encoding high-cardinality categorical identifiers
into compact numerical vectors. Unlike traditional hashing or one-hot
encodings, MLT preserves bijective mappings by leveraging modular arithmetic
over finite fields and invertible linear transformations. The method offers
explicit control of dimensionality and computational scalability while
maintaining full reversibility, even for millions of identifiers. Experimental
results on the MovieLens 20M dataset show that MLT achieves comparable
predictive performance to supervised embeddings while requiring significantly
fewer parameters and lower training cost. An open-source implementation of MLT
is available on PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/light-mlt/) and GitHub

Conclusion: 多源GeoFM整合是补充和加强受限常规健康信息系统的有效且有价值的工具。

Abstract: The reliability of routine health data in low and middle-income countries
(LMICs) is often constrained by reporting delays and incomplete coverage,
necessitating the exploration of novel data sources and analytics. Geospatial
Foundation Models (GeoFMs) offer a promising avenue by synthesizing diverse
spatial, temporal, and behavioral data into mathematical embeddings that can be
efficiently used for downstream prediction tasks. This study evaluated the
predictive performance of three GeoFM embedding sources - Google Population
Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM), Google AlphaEarth (derived from satellite
imagery), and mobile phone call detail records (CDR) - for modeling 15 routine
health programmatic outputs in Malawi, and compared their utility to
traditional geospatial interpolation methods. We used XGBoost models on data
from 552 health catchment areas (January 2021-May 2023), assessing performance
with R2, and using an 80/20 training and test data split with 5-fold
cross-validation used in training. While predictive performance was mixed, the
embedding-based approaches improved upon baseline geostatistical methods in 13
of 15 (87%) indicators tested. A Multi-GeoFM model integrating all three
embedding sources produced the most robust predictions, achieving average
5-fold cross validated R2 values for indicators like population density (0.63),
new HIV cases (0.57), and child vaccinations (0.47) and test set R2 of 0.64,
0.68, and 0.55, respectively. Prediction was poor for prediction targets with
low primary data availability, such as TB and malnutrition cases. These results
demonstrate that GeoFM embeddings imbue a modest predictive improvement for
select health and demographic outcomes in an LMIC context. We conclude that the
integration of multiple GeoFM sources is an efficient and valuable tool for
supplementing and strengthening constrained routine health information systems.

Abstract: This paper surveys studies on the use of neural networks for optimization in
the training-data-free setting. Specifically, we examine the dataless
application of neural network architectures in optimization by
re-parameterizing problems using fully connected (or MLP), convolutional,
graph, and quadratic neural networks. Although MLPs have been used to solve
linear programs a few decades ago, this approach has recently gained increasing
attention due to its promising results across diverse applications, including
those based on combinatorial optimization, inverse problems, and partial
differential equations. The motivation for this setting stems from two key
(possibly over-lapping) factors: (i) data-driven learning approaches are still
underdeveloped and have yet to demonstrate strong results, as seen in
combinatorial optimization, and (ii) the availability of training data is
inherently limited, such as in medical image reconstruction and other
scientific applications. In this paper, we define the dataless setting and
categorize it into two variants based on how a problem instance -- defined by a
single datum -- is encoded onto the neural network: (i) architecture-agnostic
methods and (ii) architecture-specific methods. Additionally, we discuss
similarities and clarify distinctions between the dataless neural network (dNN)
settings and related concepts such as zero-shot learning, one-shot learning,
lifting in optimization, and over-parameterization.

Motivation: InfoNCE虽然被广泛用于互信息估计，但其与MI的间接联系存在问题，需要开发更准确的MI估计方法。

Method: 引入辅助锚点类进行一致的密度比估计，提出InfoNCE-anchor方法，并使用适当评分规则统一各种对比学习目标。

Result: InfoNCE-anchor在MI估计中显著减少偏差，但在自监督表示学习中并未提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 对比表示学习的优势不在于准确的MI估计本身，而在于学习结构化的密度比。

Abstract: The InfoNCE objective, originally introduced for contrastive representation
learning, has become a popular choice for mutual information (MI) estimation,
despite its indirect connection to MI. In this paper, we demonstrate why
InfoNCE should not be regarded as a valid MI estimator, and we introduce a
simple modification, which we refer to as InfoNCE-anchor, for accurate MI
estimation. Our modification introduces an auxiliary anchor class, enabling
consistent density ratio estimation and yielding a plug-in MI estimator with
significantly reduced bias. Beyond this, we generalize our framework using
proper scoring rules, which recover InfoNCE-anchor as a special case when the
log score is employed. This formulation unifies a broad spectrum of contrastive
objectives, including NCE, InfoNCE, and $f$-divergence variants, under a single
principled framework. Empirically, we find that InfoNCE-anchor with the log
score achieves the most accurate MI estimates; however, in self-supervised
representation learning experiments, we find that the anchor does not improve
the downstream task performance. These findings corroborate that contrastive
representation learning benefits not from accurate MI estimation per se, but
from the learning of structured density ratios.

Abstract: Differentiating through constrained optimization problems is increasingly
central to learning, control, and large-scale decision-making systems, yet
practical integration remains challenging due to solver specialization and
interface mismatches. This paper presents a general and streamlined
framework-an updated DiffOpt.jl-that unifies modeling and differentiation
within the Julia optimization stack. The framework computes forward - and
reverse-mode solution and objective sensitivities for smooth, potentially
nonconvex programs by differentiating the KKT system under standard regularity
assumptions. A first-class, JuMP-native parameter-centric API allows users to
declare named parameters and obtain derivatives directly with respect to them -
even when a parameter appears in multiple constraints and objectives -
eliminating brittle bookkeeping from coefficient-level interfaces. We
illustrate these capabilities on convex and nonconvex models, including
economic dispatch, mean-variance portfolio selection with conic risk
constraints, and nonlinear robot inverse kinematics. Two companion studies
further demonstrate impact at scale: gradient-based iterative methods for
strategic bidding in energy markets and Sobolev-style training of end-to-end
optimization proxies using solver-accurate sensitivities. Together, these
results demonstrate that differentiable optimization can be deployed as a
routine tool for experimentation, learning, calibration, and design-without
deviating from standard JuMP modeling practices and while retaining access to a
broad ecosystem of solvers.

TL;DR: 提出了INFEX框架，用于解决线性bandit中的低频探索问题，在探索频率超过对数阈值时能达到与标准高效算法相当的实例依赖遗憾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决完全自适应探索方法（如UCB和Thompson Sampling）需要频繁探索与纯贪婪方法需要严格多样性假设之间的差距，在安全关键或成本高昂的领域中，连续探索可能不切实际或不道德。

Method: INFEX框架按照给定调度执行基础探索策略，在探索间隔之间主要选择贪婪动作。这是一个通用的模块化框架，可以无缝集成任何完全自适应探索方法。

Result: 理论分析表明，只要探索频率超过对数阈值，INFEX就能实现与标准可证明高效算法相当的实例依赖遗憾。实证评估证实了理论发现，显示出优于现有方法的遗憾性能和运行时改进。

Conclusion: INFEX是一个简单实用的低频探索框架，通过限制密集探索计算到低频间隔，既能保持理论性能又能提高计算效率，具有广泛的适用性和易用性。

Abstract: We study the problem of infrequent exploration in linear bandits, addressing
a significant yet overlooked gap between fully adaptive exploratory methods
(e.g., UCB and Thompson Sampling), which explore potentially at every time
step, and purely greedy approaches, which require stringent diversity
assumptions to succeed. Continuous exploration can be impractical or unethical
in safety-critical or costly domains, while purely greedy strategies typically
fail without adequate contextual diversity. To bridge these extremes, we
introduce a simple and practical framework, INFEX, explicitly designed for
infrequent exploration. INFEX executes a base exploratory policy according to a
given schedule while predominantly choosing greedy actions in between. Despite
its simplicity, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that INFEX achieves
instance-dependent regret matching standard provably efficient algorithms,
provided the exploration frequency exceeds a logarithmic threshold.
Additionally, INFEX is a general, modular framework that allows seamless
integration of any fully adaptive exploration method, enabling wide
applicability and ease of adoption. By restricting intensive exploratory
computations to infrequent intervals, our approach can also enhance
computational efficiency. Empirical evaluations confirm our theoretical
findings, showing state-of-the-art regret performance and runtime improvements
over existing methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种双混合专家框架用于离散时间生存分析，结合特征编码器和风险预测的混合专家模型，在乳腺癌数据集上显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生存分析需要同时建模患者异质性和时间动态，现有方法难以灵活适应个体特征和时序变化。

Method: 使用双混合专家框架：特征编码器MoE用于子群感知表示学习，风险MoE利用患者特征和时间嵌入捕获时间动态。

Result: 在METABRIC和GBSG乳腺癌数据集上，时间依赖C指数在测试集上提升高达0.04，与Consurv框架结合时获得进一步增益。

Conclusion: 双MoE框架能有效提升生存分析性能，灵活集成到现有深度学习生存分析流程中。

Abstract: Survival analysis is a task to model the time until an event of interest
occurs, widely used in clinical and biomedical research. A key challenge is to
model patient heterogeneity while also adapting risk predictions to both
individual characteristics and temporal dynamics. We propose a dual
mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework for discrete-time survival analysis. Our
approach combines a feature-encoder MoE for subgroup-aware representation
learning with a hazard MoE that leverages patient features and time embeddings
to capture temporal dynamics. This dual-MoE design flexibly integrates with
existing deep learning based survival pipelines. On METABRIC and GBSG breast
cancer datasets, our method consistently improves performance, boosting the
time-dependent C-index up to 0.04 on the test sets, and yields further gains
when incorporated into the Consurv framework.

Abstract: Do AI systems truly understand human concepts or merely mimic surface
patterns? We investigate this through chess, where human creativity meets
precise strategic concepts. Analyzing a 270M-parameter transformer that
achieves grandmaster-level play, we uncover a striking paradox: while early
layers encode human concepts like center control and knight outposts with up to
85\% accuracy, deeper layers, despite driving superior performance, drift
toward alien representations, dropping to 50-65\% accuracy. To test conceptual
robustness beyond memorization, we introduce the first Chess960 dataset: 240
expert-annotated positions across 6 strategic concepts. When opening theory is
eliminated through randomized starting positions, concept recognition drops
10-20\% across all methods, revealing the model's reliance on memorized
patterns rather than abstract understanding. Our layer-wise analysis exposes a
fundamental tension in current architectures: the representations that win
games diverge from those that align with human thinking. These findings suggest
that as AI systems optimize for performance, they develop increasingly alien
intelligence, a critical challenge for creative AI applications requiring
genuine human-AI collaboration. Dataset and code are available at:

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective method for model compression and
transferring knowledge between models. However, its effect on model's
robustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on
out-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the
effect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''
capabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language
inference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,
we illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a
model is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit
from injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a
model may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur
across different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention
pattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above
findings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of
debiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing
iterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights
obtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale.
Our findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better
debiasing methods.

Method: 使用可扩展的端到端transformer流水线和精心生成的训练数据，在五个不同模型大小和三个数量级的计算量范围内进行系统研究。

Result: 发现验证损失和求解率都遵循计算量的幂律趋势，确定了计算最优的超参数缩放：最优批大小和学习率随模型大小增长，最优token-参数比约为15。

Conclusion: 符号回归性能主要可由计算量预测，这些结果为训练下一代符号回归模型提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover the underlying mathematical
expressions that explain observed data. This holds promise for both gaining
scientific insight and for producing inherently interpretable and generalizable
models for tabular data. In this work we focus on the basics of SR. Deep
learning-based SR has recently become competitive with genetic programming
approaches, but the role of scale has remained largely unexplored. Inspired by
scaling laws in language modeling, we present the first systematic
investigation of scaling in SR, using a scalable end-to-end transformer
pipeline and carefully generated training data. Across five different model
sizes and spanning three orders of magnitude in compute, we find that both
validation loss and solved rate follow clear power-law trends with compute. We
further identify compute-optimal hyperparameter scaling: optimal batch size and
learning rate grow with model size, and a token-to-parameter ratio of
$\approx$15 is optimal in our regime, with a slight upward trend as compute
increases. These results demonstrate that SR performance is largely predictable
from compute and offer important insights for training the next generation of
SR models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习方法在固定几何空间中搜索最优参数，限制了模型的表达能力。本文旨在通过动态几何优化来突破这一限制，构建能够自主演化几何结构的元学习器。

Method: 构建变分框架，损失函数平衡数据保真度和流形内在几何复杂度；使用离散微分几何方法，将连续流形离散化为三角网格，通过边长度参数化度量张量，利用自动微分工具进行高效优化。

Result: 理论分析揭示了该框架与广义相对论中爱因斯坦-希尔伯特作用的深刻类比，为"数据驱动几何"概念提供了优雅物理解释；证明了即使固定拓扑，度量优化也比固定几何模型具有显著更强的表达能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作为构建能够自主演化几何和拓扑的完全动态"元学习器"奠定了坚实基础，在科学模型发现和鲁棒表示学习等领域具有广阔应用前景。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel paradigm for machine learning that moves beyond
traditional parameter optimization. Unlike conventional approaches that search
for optimal parameters within a fixed geometric space, our core idea is to
treat the model itself as a malleable geometric entity. Specifically, we
optimize the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology,
thereby dynamically shaping the geometric structure of the model space. To
achieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function
carefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of
the manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data,
while the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular
geometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the
computational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we
introduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the
continuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric
tensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using
automatic differentiation tools. Theoretical analysis reveals a profound
analogy between our framework and the Einstein-Hilbert action in general
relativity, providing an elegant physical interpretation for the concept of
"data-driven geometry". We further argue that even with fixed topology, metric
optimization offers significantly greater expressive power than models with
fixed geometry. This work lays a solid foundation for constructing fully
dynamic "meta-learners" capable of autonomously evolving their geometry and
topology, and it points to broad application prospects in areas such as
scientific model discovery and robust representation learning.

Motivation: 合成数据生成可以解决在机器学习应用中使用敏感金融数据时面临的隐私风险和监管约束问题，但该领域缺乏全面的研究综述。

Method: 对2018年以来发表的72项研究进行系统综述，分类分析了合成的金融信息类型、生成方法和评估策略。

Result: GAN方法在文献中占主导地位，特别是在时间序列市场数据和表格信用数据生成方面。虽然一些创新技术显示出改进真实性和隐私保护的潜力，但大多数研究缺乏对隐私保护的严格评估。

Conclusion: 该综述提供了生成技术、应用和评估方法的综合概览，指出了关键研究空白，并为开发稳健、保护隐私的金融领域合成数据解决方案提供了指导。

Abstract: Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising approach to address the
challenges of using sensitive financial data in machine learning applications.
By leveraging generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), it is possible to create artificial
datasets that preserve the statistical properties of real financial records
while mitigating privacy risks and regulatory constraints. Despite the rapid
growth of this field, a comprehensive synthesis of the current research
landscape has been lacking. This systematic review consolidates and analyses 72
studies published since 2018 that focus on synthetic financial data generation.
We categorise the types of financial information synthesised, the generative
methods employed, and the evaluation strategies used to assess data utility and
privacy. The findings indicate that GAN-based approaches dominate the
literature, particularly for generating time-series market data and tabular
credit data. While several innovative techniques demonstrate potential for
improved realism and privacy preservation, there remains a notable lack of
rigorous evaluation of privacy safeguards across studies. By providing an
integrated overview of generative techniques, applications, and evaluation
methods, this review highlights critical research gaps and offers guidance for
future work aimed at developing robust, privacy-preserving synthetic data
solutions for the financial domain.

Motivation: 传统LLM结构缺乏基于任务信息的专门记忆机制，无法在保持广泛能力的同时在目标领域达到专家级性能。

Method: 提出Nirvana模型，包含任务感知记忆触发器（Trigger）和专门记忆更新器（Updater），前者根据当前任务需求灵活调整记忆机制，后者动态记忆由Trigger引导的上下文。

Result: 在自然语言建模基准测试中取得竞争性或更优结果；在医学MRI任务中，相比传统MRI模型和传统LLM骨干网络，实现了更高质量的MRI重建并能生成准确的初步临床报告。

Conclusion: Nirvana通过专门的记忆机制成功实现了专业通用模型的目标，在保持广泛能力的同时在特定领域达到专家级性能。

Abstract: Specialized Generalist Models (SGMs) aim to preserve broad capabilities while
achieving expert-level performance in target domains. However, traditional LLM
structures including Transformer, Linear Attention, and hybrid models do not
employ specialized memory mechanism guided by task information. In this paper,
we present Nirvana, an SGM with specialized memory mechanism, linear time
complexity, and test-time task information extraction. Besides, we propose the
Task-Aware Memory Trigger ($\textit{Trigger}$) that flexibly adjusts memory
mechanism based on the current task's requirements. In Trigger, each incoming
sample is treated as a self-supervised fine-tuning task, enabling Nirvana to
adapt its task-related parameters on the fly to domain shifts. We also design
the Specialized Memory Updater ($\textit{Updater}$) that dynamically memorizes
the context guided by Trigger. We conduct experiments on both general language
tasks and specialized medical tasks. On a variety of natural language modeling
benchmarks, Nirvana achieves competitive or superior results compared to the
existing LLM structures. To prove the effectiveness of Trigger on specialized
tasks, we test Nirvana's performance on a challenging medical task, i.e.,
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). We post-train frozen Nirvana backbone with
lightweight codecs on paired electromagnetic signals and MRI images. Despite
the frozen Nirvana backbone, Trigger guides the model to adapt to the MRI
domain with the change of task-related parameters. Nirvana achieves
higher-quality MRI reconstruction compared to conventional MRI models as well
as the models with traditional LLMs' backbone, and can also generate accurate
preliminary clinical reports accordingly.

Motivation: 传统基于补丁的二分定位方法存在多个限制：假设bug引入提交和补丁提交修改相同函数、仅依赖代码变更而忽略提交消息中的漏洞信息、基于简单启发式规则缺乏逻辑分析

Method: 构建多阶段流水线，利用LLM：(1)充分利用补丁信息，(2)在上下文中比较多个候选提交，(3)通过一系列筛选步骤逐步缩小候选范围

Result: 评估显示该方法比最先进解决方案准确率提升超过38%，多阶段流水线相比基线LLM二分方法准确率提升60%

Conclusion: LLM能够突破现有解决方案的障碍，多阶段流水线对于准确识别bug引入提交至关重要

Abstract: Bug bisection has been an important security task that aims to understand the
range of software versions impacted by a bug, i.e., identifying the commit that
introduced the bug. However, traditional patch-based bisection methods are
faced with several significant barriers: For example, they assume that the
bug-inducing commit (BIC) and the patch commit modify the same functions, which
is not always true. They often rely solely on code changes, while the commit
message frequently contains a wealth of vulnerability-related information. They
are also based on simple heuristics (e.g., assuming the BIC initializes lines
deleted in the patch) and lack any logical analysis of the vulnerability.
  In this paper, we make the observation that Large Language Models (LLMs) are
well-positioned to break the barriers of existing solutions, e.g., comprehend
both textual data and code in patches and commits. Unlike previous BIC
identification approaches, which yield poor results, we propose a comprehensive
multi-stage pipeline that leverages LLMs to: (1) fully utilize patch
information, (2) compare multiple candidate commits in context, and (3)
progressively narrow down the candidates through a series of down-selection
steps. In our evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves
significantly better accuracy than the state-of-the-art solution by more than
38\%. Our results further confirm that the comprehensive multi-stage pipeline
is essential, as it improves accuracy by 60\% over a baseline LLM-based
bisection method.

TL;DR: 提出了两种基于多智能体强化学习的交通路由方法：自适应导航(AN)和分层枢纽自适应导航(HHAN)，用于解决城市交通拥堵问题。AN使用图注意力网络建模局部交通状态，HHAN通过枢纽节点实现大规模网络的可扩展路由。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的最短路径优先算法在动态多车辆环境中表现不佳，会加剧拥堵。需要开发能够协调多车辆、考虑网络状态的智能路由系统。

Method: AN：去中心化MARL模型，每个交叉口智能体使用图注意力网络建模局部和邻域交通状态。HHAN：AN的扩展，只在关键枢纽节点部署智能体，车辆在枢纽间由智能体控制，枢纽区域内使用SPF算法。采用集中训练分散执行的A-QMIX框架。

Result: 在合成网格和真实城市地图上的实验表明，AN相比SPF和学习基线减少了平均旅行时间，保持100%路由成功率。HHAN可扩展到数百个交叉口的网络，在重交通下实现高达15.9%的改进。

Conclusion: 网络约束的MARL方法在智能交通系统中具有实现可扩展、协调和拥堵感知路由的潜力。

Abstract: Traffic congestion in urban road networks leads to longer trip times and
higher emissions, especially during peak periods. While the Shortest Path First
(SPF) algorithm is optimal for a single vehicle in a static network, it
performs poorly in dynamic, multi-vehicle settings, often worsening congestion
by routing all vehicles along identical paths. We address dynamic vehicle
routing through a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for
coordinated, network-aware fleet navigation. We first propose Adaptive
Navigation (AN), a decentralized MARL model where each intersection agent
provides routing guidance based on (i) local traffic and (ii) neighborhood
state modeled using Graph Attention Networks (GAT). To improve scalability in
large networks, we further propose Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation
(HHAN), an extension of AN that assigns agents only to key intersections
(hubs). Vehicles are routed hub-to-hub under agent control, while SPF handles
micro-routing within each hub region. For hub coordination, HHAN adopts
centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under the Attentive
Q-Mixing (A-QMIX) framework, which aggregates asynchronous vehicle decisions
via attention. Hub agents use flow-aware state features that combine local
congestion and predictive dynamics for proactive routing. Experiments on
synthetic grids and real urban maps (Toronto, Manhattan) show that AN reduces
average travel time versus SPF and learning baselines, maintaining 100% routing
success. HHAN scales to networks with hundreds of intersections, achieving up
to 15.9% improvement under heavy traffic. These findings highlight the
potential of network-constrained MARL for scalable, coordinated, and
congestion-aware routing in intelligent transportation systems.

Motivation: 传统机器学习评估方法基于测试集平均损失，这在地球科学中忽略了人类发展和地理分布的不均匀性，无法反映模型在不同区域的真实性能差异。

Method: 开发SAFE工具包，整合多种数据域，按领土（国家）、全球子区域、收入水平和土地覆盖类型对地理网格点进行分层，评估每个分层内的模型性能。

Result: 应用SAFE评估多个最先进的AI天气预测模型，发现所有模型在所有属性上都存在预测技能差异，建立了基于不同提前时间和气候变量的模型预测公平性基准。

Conclusion: 通过超越全局平均指标，SAFE首次能够识别模型在哪些区域表现最佳或最差，以及哪些模型最公平，为地球科学领域的公平评估提供了新方法。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in machine learning is to assess model performance
based on average loss across all samples in some test set. This amounts to
averaging performance geospatially across the Earth in weather and climate
settings, failing to account for the non-uniform distribution of human
development and geography. We introduce Stratified Assessments of Forecasts
over Earth (SAFE), a package for elucidating the stratified performance of a
set of predictions made over Earth. SAFE integrates various data domains to
stratify by different attributes associated with geospatial gridpoints:
territory (usually country), global subregion, income, and landcover (land or
water). This allows us to examine the performance of models for each individual
stratum of the different attributes (e.g., the accuracy in every individual
country). To demonstrate its importance, we utilize SAFE to benchmark a zoo of
state-of-the-art AI-based weather prediction models, finding that they all
exhibit disparities in forecasting skill across every attribute. We use this to
seed a benchmark of model forecast fairness through stratification at different
lead times for various climatic variables. By moving beyond globally-averaged
metrics, we for the first time ask: where do models perform best or worst, and
which models are most fair? To support further work in this direction, the SAFE
package is open source and available at https://github.com/N-Masi/safe

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法仅基于LLMs自身生成的响应进行训练，受限于初始能力，容易陷入探索停滞，无法解决更多训练问题。

Method: LTE方法通过提示LLMs其先前生成的错误答案和过长响应问题，无需外部专家指导，增强训练过程中的利用和探索。

Result: 在六个数学基准测试中，LTE比普通GRPO在Pass@1上平均提升6.38，在Pass@k上平均提升9.00。

Conclusion: LTE成功缓解了探索停滞问题，增强了训练过程中的利用和探索能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has significantly
boosted the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) recently.
However, existing RLVR approaches merely train LLMs based on their own
generated responses and are constrained by the initial capability of LLMs, thus
prone to exploration stagnation, in which LLMs fail to solve more training
problems and cannot further learn from the training data. Some work tries to
address this by leveraging off-policy solutions to training problems but
requires external guidance from experts which suffers from limited
availability. In this work, we propose LTE (Learning to reason from Trial and
Error), an approach hinting LLMs with their previously self-generated incorrect
answers and problem of overlong responses, which does not require any external
expert guidance. Experiments validate the effectiveness of LTE, which
outperforms the normal group relative policy optimization (GRPO) by 6.38 in
Pass@1 and 9.00 in Pass@k on average across six mathematics benchmarks for
Qwen3-4B-Base. Further analysis confirms that LTE successfully mitigates the
problem of exploration stagnation and enhances both exploitation and
exploration during training.

Conclusion: maxVSTAR在隐私敏感的物联网环境中具有动态、自监督模型适应的能力，为网络边缘使用CSI感知的长期自主HAR建立了可扩展和实用的范例。

Abstract: WiFi Channel State Information (CSI)-based human activity recognition (HAR)
provides a privacy-preserving, device-free sensing solution for smart
environments. However, its deployment on edge devices is severely constrained
by domain shift, where recognition performance deteriorates under varying
environmental and hardware conditions. This study presents maxVSTAR (maximally
adaptive Vision-guided Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition), a
closed-loop, vision-guided model adaptation framework that autonomously
mitigates domain shift for edge-deployed CSI sensing systems. The proposed
system integrates a cross-modal teacher-student architecture, where a
high-accuracy YOLO-based vision model serves as a dynamic supervisory signal,
delivering real-time activity labels for the CSI data stream. These labels
enable autonomous, online fine-tuning of a lightweight CSI-based HAR model,
termed Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition (STAR), directly at the
edge. This closed-loop retraining mechanism allows STAR to continuously adapt
to environmental changes without manual intervention. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of maxVSTAR. When deployed on uncalibrated
hardware, the baseline STAR model's recognition accuracy declined from 93.52%
to 49.14%. Following a single vision-guided adaptation cycle, maxVSTAR restored
the accuracy to 81.51%. These results confirm the system's capacity for
dynamic, self-supervised model adaptation in privacy-conscious IoT
environments, establishing a scalable and practical paradigm for long-term
autonomous HAR using CSI sensing at the network edge.

feasibility within resource-constrained, embedded mobile edge environments.
This paper proposes STAR (Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition), an
edge-AI-optimized framework that integrates a lightweight neural architecture,
adaptive signal processing, and hardware-aware co-optimization to enable
real-time, energy-efficient HAR on low-power embedded devices. STAR
incorporates a streamlined Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based recurrent neural
network, reducing model parameters by 33% compared to conventional LSTM models
while maintaining effective temporal modeling capability. A multi-stage
pre-processing pipeline combining median filtering, 8th-order Butterworth
low-pass filtering, and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is employed to
denoise CSI amplitude data and extract spatial-temporal features. For on-device
deployment, STAR is implemented on a Rockchip RV1126 processor equipped with an
embedded Neural Processing Unit (NPU), interfaced with an ESP32-S3-based CSI
acquisition module. Experimental results demonstrate a mean recognition
accuracy of 93.52% across seven activity classes and 99.11% for human presence
detection, utilizing a compact 97.6k-parameter model. INT8 quantized inference
achieves a processing speed of 33 MHz with just 8% CPU utilization, delivering
sixfold speed improvements over CPU-based execution. With sub-second response
latency and low power consumption, the system ensures real-time,
privacy-preserving HAR, offering a practical, scalable solution for mobile and
pervasive computing environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MolBridge是一个基于子结构感知对齐的分子-文本学习框架，通过分子子结构和化学短语的额外对齐信号来增强分子-描述对，使用子结构感知对比学习和自精炼机制来学习细粒度对应关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型难以捕捉分子与其描述之间的细微差异，缺乏学习分子子结构与化学短语之间细粒度对齐的能力。

Method: 通过分子子结构和化学短语的额外对齐信号增强原始分子-描述对，采用子结构感知对比学习和自精炼机制来过滤噪声对齐信号。

Result: MolBridge在多个分子基准测试中有效捕捉细粒度对应关系，并优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 子结构感知对齐在分子-文本学习中具有重要意义，MolBridge框架展示了其有效性。

Abstract: Molecule and text representation learning has gained increasing interest due
to its potential for enhancing the understanding of chemical information.
However, existing models often struggle to capture subtle differences between
molecules and their descriptions, as they lack the ability to learn
fine-grained alignments between molecular substructures and chemical phrases.
To address this limitation, we introduce MolBridge, a novel molecule-text
learning framework based on substructure-aware alignments. Specifically, we
augment the original molecule-description pairs with additional alignment
signals derived from molecular substructures and chemical phrases. To
effectively learn from these enriched alignments, MolBridge employs
substructure-aware contrastive learning, coupled with a self-refinement
mechanism that filters out noisy alignment signals. Experimental results show
that MolBridge effectively captures fine-grained correspondences and
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on a wide range of molecular benchmarks,
highlighting the significance of substructure-aware alignment in molecule-text
learning.

Motivation: 研究先进特征工程和混合模型架构在多元工业时间序列异常检测中的有效性，特别关注蒸汽轮机系统。

Method: 评估变化点衍生的统计特征、基于聚类的子结构表示和混合学习策略对检测性能的影响，并与简单的随机森林+XGBoost集成模型进行比较。

Result: 复杂方法表现不佳，而简单集成模型在分割数据上表现最佳：AUC-ROC 0.976，F1分数0.41，在定义时间窗口内100%早期检测。

Conclusion: 在高度不平衡和时间不确定的数据场景中，模型简洁性结合优化分割可以胜过更复杂的架构，提供更好的鲁棒性、可解释性和操作实用性。

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of advanced feature
engineering and hybrid model architectures for anomaly detection in a
multivariate industrial time series, focusing on a steam turbine system. We
evaluate the impact of change point-derived statistical features,
clustering-based substructure representations, and hybrid learning strategies
on detection performance. Despite their theoretical appeal, these complex
approaches consistently underperformed compared to a simple Random Forest +
XGBoost ensemble trained on segmented data. The ensemble achieved an AUC-ROC of
0.976, F1-score of 0.41, and 100% early detection within the defined time
window. Our findings highlight that, in scenarios with highly imbalanced and
temporally uncertain data, model simplicity combined with optimized
segmentation can outperform more sophisticated architectures, offering greater
robustness, interpretability, and operational utility.

TL;DR: 提出协作公共资源分配(CPRA)问题，考虑容量约束和时空动态，并开发基于博弈论的时空强化学习框架GSTRL来解决这个NP难问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公共资源分配方法独立优化单个资源移动，未考虑容量约束，限制了实际应用效果。

Method: 将CPRA问题建模为势博弈，证明势函数与最优目标无差距，设计GSTRL框架捕捉系统时空动态。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上的实验表明GSTRL具有优越性能。

Conclusion: GSTRL为CPRA问题提供了理论基础和有效解决方案，在真实场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Public resource allocation involves the efficient distribution of resources,
including urban infrastructure, energy, and transportation, to effectively meet
societal demands. However, existing methods focus on optimizing the movement of
individual resources independently, without considering their capacity
constraints. To address this limitation, we propose a novel and more practical
problem: Collaborative Public Resource Allocation (CPRA), which explicitly
incorporates capacity constraints and spatio-temporal dynamics in real-world
scenarios. We propose a new framework called Game-Theoretic Spatio-Temporal
Reinforcement Learning (GSTRL) for solving CPRA. Our contributions are twofold:
1) We formulate the CPRA problem as a potential game and demonstrate that there
is no gap between the potential function and the optimal target, laying a solid
theoretical foundation for approximating the Nash equilibrium of this NP-hard
problem; and 2) Our designed GSTRL framework effectively captures the
spatio-temporal dynamics of the overall system. We evaluate GSTRL on two
real-world datasets, where experiments show its superior performance. Our
source codes are available in the supplementary materials.

*Yunxiao Shi,Shuo Yang,Yixin Su,Rui Zhang,Min Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出ACC-SGD-IE方法，通过跨训练传播留一扰动并更新累积影响状态，改进传统SGD-IE在数据影响估计中的准确性，特别是在长训练周期中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代以数据为中心的AI需要精确的逐样本影响估计。传统SGD-IE方法通过累加每轮替代项来近似留一影响，但忽略了跨轮次的复合效应，导致对关键样本的错误排序。

Method: 提出ACC-SGD-IE，一种轨迹感知估计器，在训练过程中传播留一扰动，并在每个步骤更新累积影响状态。在平滑强凸设置中实现几何误差收缩，在平滑非凸设置中收紧误差界限。

Result: 在Adult、20 Newsgroups和MNIST数据集上的实验表明，ACC-SGD-IE在干净和污染数据、凸和非凸训练下都能产生更准确的影响估计，特别是在长训练周期中。在数据清洗任务中能更可靠地标记噪声样本。

Conclusion: 使用ACC-SGD-IE清洗的数据训练的模型优于使用SGD-IE清洗的模型，证明了该方法在数据影响估计和数据清洗任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Modern data-centric AI needs precise per-sample influence. Standard SGD-IE
approximates leave-one-out effects by summing per-epoch surrogates and ignores
cross-epoch compounding, which misranks critical examples. We propose
ACC-SGD-IE, a trajectory-aware estimator that propagates the leave-one-out
perturbation across training and updates an accumulative influence state at
each step. In smooth strongly convex settings it achieves geometric error
contraction and, in smooth non-convex regimes, it tightens error bounds; larger
mini-batches further reduce constants. Empirically, on Adult, 20 Newsgroups,
and MNIST under clean and corrupted data and both convex and non-convex
training, ACC-SGD-IE yields more accurate influence estimates, especially over
long epochs. For downstream data cleansing it more reliably flags noisy
samples, producing models trained on ACC-SGD-IE cleaned data that outperform
those cleaned with SGD-IE.

Motivation: 减少可预防的医院再入院是国家优先事项，再入院率被用作衡量医院医疗质量的基准。

Method: 使用逻辑回归、随机森林和支持向量机等机器学习技术，结合主成分分析进行降维，分析健康索赔数据。

Result: 随机森林模型表现最佳，其次是逻辑回归和支持向量机模型，基于AUC指标评估。

Conclusion: 这些模型可用于识别导致再入院的关键因素，帮助识别需要重点关注的患者，从而降低再入院率、减少成本并提高医疗质量。

Abstract: Reducing preventable hospital readmissions is a national priority for payers,
providers, and policymakers seeking to improve health care and lower costs. The
rate of readmission is being used as a benchmark to determine the quality of
healthcare provided by the hospitals. In thisproject, we have used machine
learning techniques like Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Support Vector
Machines to analyze the health claims data and identify demographic and medical
factors that play a crucial role in predicting all-cause readmissions. As the
health claims data is high dimensional, we have used Principal Component
Analysis as a dimension reduction technique and used the results for building
regression models. We compared and evaluated these models based on the Area
Under Curve (AUC) metric. Random Forest model gave the highest performance
followed by Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine models. These models
can be used to identify the crucial factors causing readmissions and help
identify patients to focus on to reduce the chances of readmission, ultimately
bringing down the cost and increasing the quality of healthcare provided to the
patients.

Method: 基于随机控制输入的采样模型预测控制，在预logits层应用高斯扰动，通过重要性采样获得最优均值。

Result: AISP在奖励与使用样本数量的关系上优于最佳n采样，并比其他基于奖励的测试时对齐方法获得更高奖励。

Conclusion: AISP是一种有效的测试时对齐方法，能够在不需要微调的情况下优化模型性能。

Abstract: Test-time alignment of large language models (LLMs) attracts attention
because fine-tuning LLMs requires high computational costs. In this paper, we
propose a new test-time alignment method called adaptive importance sampling on
pre-logits (AISP) on the basis of the sampling-based model predictive control
with the stochastic control input. AISP applies the Gaussian perturbation into
pre-logits, which are outputs of the penultimate layer, so as to maximize
expected rewards with respect to the mean of the perturbation. We demonstrate
that the optimal mean is obtained by importance sampling with sampled rewards.
AISP outperforms best-of-n sampling in terms of rewards over the number of used
samples and achieves higher rewards than other reward-based test-time alignment
methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于归纳方法的机器学习遗忘方案，通过在模型末尾添加投影重分布层来实现知识移除，无需访问原始数据集或完整模型，具有模块化和模型无关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习遗忘方法在现实部署中面临可扩展性问题，需要完整访问原始数据集和模型，而本文方法旨在解决这些实际挑战。

Method: 将分类训练视为序列过程，通过逆转最后训练序列实现遗忘，在模型末尾添加投影重分布层作为输出过滤器。

Result: 在多个数据集（CIFAR-10/100、Covertype）上的实验表明，该方法输出与完全重新训练的模型一致，同时大幅降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 该方法在实际场景中具有适用性、可扩展性和系统兼容性，同时保持输出性能。

Abstract: As a new and promising approach, existing machine unlearning (MU) works
typically emphasize theoretical formulations or optimization objectives to
achieve knowledge removal. However, when deployed in real-world scenarios, such
solutions typically face scalability issues and have to address practical
requirements such as full access to original datasets and model. In contrast to
the existing approaches, we regard classification training as a sequential
process where classes are learned sequentially, which we call \emph{inductive
approach}. Unlearning can then be done by reversing the last training sequence.
This is implemented by appending a projection-redistribution layer in the end
of the model. Such an approach does not require full access to the original
dataset or the model, addressing the challenges of existing methods. This
enables modular and model-agnostic deployment as an output filter into existing
classification pipelines with minimal alterations. We conducted multiple
experiments across multiple datasets including image (CIFAR-10/100 using
CNN-based model) and tabular datasets (Covertype using tree-based model).
Experiment results show consistently similar output to a fully retrained model
with a high computational cost reduction. This demonstrates the applicability,
scalability, and system compatibility of our solution while maintaining the
performance of the output in a more practical setting.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Angular Steering的新方法，通过旋转激活向量在固定二维子空间内实现行为调控，相比现有方法更灵活稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型行为调控方法（如向量加法和方向消融）局限于二维子空间，对参数选择敏感且可能影响不相关特征，需要更灵活稳定的调控方法。

Method: Angular Steering通过将激活向量在固定二维子空间内进行几何旋转来调控行为，还提出了自适应变体仅旋转与目标特征对齐的激活。

Result: 实验表明该方法能实现稳健的行为控制，同时保持通用语言建模性能，相比先前方法具有更好的灵活性、泛化性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Angular Steering为行为调控提供了统一的几何旋转框架，简化了参数选择并保持了模型稳定性，是安全可靠AI部署的有效方法。

Abstract: Controlling specific behaviors in large language models while preserving
their general capabilities is a central challenge for safe and reliable
artificial intelligence deployment. Current steering methods, such as vector
addition and directional ablation, are constrained within a two-dimensional
subspace defined by the activation and feature direction, making them sensitive
to chosen parameters and potentially affecting unrelated features due to
unintended interactions in activation space. We introduce Angular Steering, a
novel and flexible method for behavior modulation that operates by rotating
activations within a fixed two-dimensional subspace. By formulating steering as
a geometric rotation toward or away from a target behavior direction, Angular
Steering provides continuous, fine-grained control over behaviors such as
refusal and compliance. We demonstrate this method using refusal steering
emotion steering as use cases. Additionally, we propose Adaptive Angular
Steering, a selective variant that rotates only activations aligned with the
target feature, further enhancing stability and coherence. Angular Steering
generalizes existing addition and orthogonalization techniques under a unified
geometric rotation framework, simplifying parameter selection and maintaining
model stability across a broader range of adjustments. Experiments across
multiple model families and sizes show that Angular Steering achieves robust
behavioral control while maintaining general language modeling performance,
underscoring its flexibility, generalization, and robustness compared to prior
approaches. Code and artifacts are available at

Motivation: 大多数生成模型缺乏对插值的主概念，需要限制模型或数据维度的假设。本文旨在开发一个通用的插值方案，与数据分布兼容。

Method: 考虑类似于受限于合适数据分布的测地线的插值，推导了一种无需额外训练的计算这些曲线的新算法。理论上，该方法在局部可视为在合适的黎曼度量下的测地线。

Result: 定量实验表明，该方法在多种模型和数据集上比基线方法更频繁地穿越高密度区域。

Conclusion: 开发了一种通用的插值方案，能够在生成模型中实现受控生成和模型检查，无需限制性假设或额外训练。

Abstract: Interpolation in generative models allows for controlled generation, model
inspection, and more. Unfortunately, most generative models lack a principal
notion of interpolants without restrictive assumptions on either the model or
data dimension. In this paper, we develop a general interpolation scheme that
targets likely transition paths compatible with different metrics and
probability distributions. We consider interpolants analogous to a geodesic
constrained to a suitable data distribution and derive a novel algorithm for
computing these curves, which requires no additional training. Theoretically,
we show that our method locally can be considered as a geodesic under a
suitable Riemannian metric. We quantitatively show that our interpolation
scheme traverses higher density regions than baselines across a range of models
and datasets.

Method: 在扩散生成过程中根据期望聚合多目标值进行加权重采样，确保生成的样本符合期望的多目标玻尔兹曼分布。

Result: 实验显示IMG仅需单次生成即可实现比基准算法（通常需要数百次扩散生成）显著更高的超体积。

Conclusion: IMG算法可被视为优化的扩散过程，并能集成到现有方法中进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have been successful in learning complex data distributions.
This capability has driven their application to high-dimensional
multi-objective black-box optimization problem. Existing approaches often
employ an external optimization loop, such as an evolutionary algorithm, to the
diffusion model. However, these approaches treat the diffusion model as a
black-box refiner, which overlooks the internal distribution transition of the
diffusion generation process, limiting their efficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose the Inference-time Multi-target Generation (IMG)
algorithm, which optimizes the diffusion process at inference-time to generate
samples that simultaneously satisfy multiple objectives. Specifically, our IMG
performs weighted resampling during the diffusion generation process according
to the expected aggregated multi-objective values. This weighted resampling
strategy ensures the diffusion-generated samples are distributed according to
our desired multi-target Boltzmann distribution. We further derive that the
multi-target Boltzmann distribution has an interesting log-likelihood
interpretation, where it is the optimal solution to the distributional
multi-objective optimization problem. We implemented IMG for a multi-objective
molecule generation task. Experiments show that IMG, requiring only a single
generation pass, achieves a significantly higher hypervolume than baseline
optimization algorithms that often require hundreds of diffusion generations.
Notably, our algorithm can be viewed as an optimized diffusion process and can
be integrated into existing methods to further improve their performance.

Abstract: Multi-task learning in contextual bandits has attracted significant research
interest due to its potential to enhance decision-making across multiple
related tasks by leveraging shared structures and task-specific heterogeneity.
In this article, we propose a novel hierarchical Bayesian framework for
learning in various bandit instances. This framework captures both the
heterogeneity and the correlations among different bandit instances through a
hierarchical Bayesian model, enabling effective information sharing while
accommodating instance-specific variations. Unlike previous methods that
overlook the learning of the covariance structure across bandits, we introduce
an empirical Bayesian approach to estimate the covariance matrix of the prior
distribution.This enhances both the practicality and flexibility of learning
across multi-bandits. Building on this approach, we develop two efficient
algorithms: ebmTS (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Thompson Sampling) and
ebmUCB (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Upper Confidence Bound), both of which
incorporate the estimated prior into the decision-making process. We provide
the frequentist regret upper bounds for the proposed algorithms, thereby
filling a research gap in the field of multi-bandit problems. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior
performance of our algorithms, particularly in complex environments. Our
methods achieve lower cumulative regret compared to existing techniques,
highlighting their effectiveness in balancing exploration and exploitation
across multi-bandits.

TL;DR: 本文研究了离线聚类偏好学习问题，提出了两种算法：Off-C²PL用于纯离线设置，A²-Off-C²PL用于带有主动数据增强的设置，以解决多用户偏好学习中的数据不平衡问题。

Motivation: 现实世界中的偏好学习涉及具有不同偏好的用户，面临两个核心挑战：(1)识别用户间的相似性以有效聚合数据，特别是在离线数据在不同维度上不平衡的情况下；(2)处理不平衡的离线数据，其中某些偏好维度代表性不足。

Conclusion: 提出的离线聚类偏好学习框架能够有效处理多用户偏好学习中的数据不平衡问题，通过聚类识别用户相似性，并通过主动数据增强策略提高学习效果。

Abstract: Preference learning from pairwise feedback is a widely adopted framework in
applications such as reinforcement learning with human feedback and
recommendations. In many practical settings, however, user interactions are
limited or costly, making offline preference learning necessary. Moreover,
real-world preference learning often involves users with different preferences.
For example, annotators from different backgrounds may rank the same responses
differently. This setting presents two central challenges: (1) identifying
similarity across users to effectively aggregate data, especially under
scenarios where offline data is imbalanced across dimensions, and (2) handling
the imbalanced offline data where some preference dimensions are
underrepresented. To address these challenges, we study the Offline Clustering
of Preference Learning problem, where the learner has access to fixed datasets
from multiple users with potentially different preferences and aims to maximize
utility for a test user. To tackle the first challenge, we first propose
Off-C$^2$PL for the pure offline setting, where the learner relies solely on
offline data. Our theoretical analysis provides a suboptimality bound that
explicitly captures the tradeoff between sample noise and bias. To address the
second challenge of inbalanced data, we extend our framework to the setting
with active-data augmentation where the learner is allowed to select a limited
number of additional active-data for the test user based on the cluster
structure learned by Off-C$^2$PL. In this setting, our second algorithm,
A$^2$-Off-C$^2$PL, actively selects samples that target the least-informative
dimensions of the test user's preference. We prove that these actively
collected samples contribute more effectively than offline ones. Finally, we
validate our theoretical results through simulations on synthetic and
real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于token感知的因果表示学习框架，解释了CLIP在组合推理上的失败原因——组合不可识别性，即存在伪最优文本编码器在保持模态对齐的同时无法区分正确描述与硬负例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在跨模态泛化方面表现优异，但在对象、属性和关系的组合推理上持续失败，现有因果解释通常将文本建模为单一向量，无法解释提示敏感性和硬负例失败等核心现象。

Method: 提出了基于语言token序列的结构因果模型(SCM)的token感知因果表示学习框架，将块可识别性扩展到token化文本，证明CLIP的对比目标可以在句子级和token级SCM下恢复模态不变潜在变量。

Result: 理论分析揭示了CLIP组合脆弱性的第一个原则性解释：组合不可识别性，存在伪最优文本编码器在实现完美模态对齐的同时对原子概念的SWAP、REPLACE和ADD操作不敏感。

Conclusion: 语言侧不可识别性通过模态间隙与视觉侧失败相关联，迭代组合操作会加剧难度，这为改进负例挖掘策略提供了理论动机。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) delivers strong cross modal
generalization by aligning images and texts in a shared embedding space, yet it
persistently fails at compositional reasoning over objects, attributes, and
relations often behaving like a bag-of-words matcher. Prior causal accounts
typically model text as a single vector, obscuring token-level structure and
leaving core phenomena-such as prompt sensitivity and failures on hard
negatives unexplained. We address this gap with a token-aware causal
representation learning (CRL) framework grounded in a sequential,
language-token SCM. Our theory extends block identifiability to tokenized text,
proving that CLIP's contrastive objective can recover the modal-invariant
latent variable under both sentence-level and token-level SCMs. Crucially,
token granularity yields the first principled explanation of CLIP's
compositional brittleness: composition nonidentifiability. We show the
existence of pseudo-optimal text encoders that achieve perfect modal-invariant
alignment yet are provably insensitive to SWAP, REPLACE, and ADD operations
over atomic concepts, thereby failing to distinguish correct captions from hard
negatives despite optimizing the same training objective as true-optimal
encoders. The analysis further links language-side nonidentifiability to
visual-side failures via the modality gap and shows how iterated composition
operators compound hardness, motivating improved negative mining strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adam是深度学习中最常用的优化器，但其理论理解仍然有限。先前分析表明Adam偏好ℓ∞-几何的解，但这些结果仅限于全批次情况。本文旨在研究增量Adam（每步使用一个样本）在线性可分数据上的隐式偏差。

Method: 构建结构化数据集来证明增量Adam收敛到ℓ2-最大间隔分类器；开发代理算法捕捉β2→1时增量Adam的极限行为；通过数据依赖的双重定点公式表征其收敛方向；比较Signum优化器的行为。

Result: 增量Adam的隐式偏差偏离全批次Adam的ℓ∞-最大间隔偏差，在特定结构化数据集上收敛到ℓ2-最大间隔分类器；Signum在任何批次大小下都收敛到ℓ∞-最大间隔分类器。

Conclusion: Adam的隐式偏差关键取决于批次方案和数据集，而Signum保持不变。增量Adam的行为与全批次Adam不同，可能收敛到不同的最大间隔分类器。

Abstract: Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2015] is the de facto optimizer in deep learning, yet
its theoretical understanding remains limited. Prior analyses show that Adam
favors solutions aligned with $\ell_\infty$-geometry, but these results are
restricted to the full-batch regime. In this work, we study the implicit bias
of incremental Adam (using one sample per step) for logistic regression on
linearly separable data, and we show that its bias can deviate from the
full-batch behavior. To illustrate this, we construct a class of structured
datasets where incremental Adam provably converges to the $\ell_2$-max-margin
classifier, in contrast to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin bias of full-batch
Adam. For general datasets, we develop a proxy algorithm that captures the
limiting behavior of incremental Adam as $\beta_2 \to 1$ and we characterize
its convergence direction via a data-dependent dual fixed-point formulation.
Finally, we prove that, unlike Adam, Signum [Bernstein et al., 2018] converges
to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin classifier for any batch size by taking $\beta$
close enough to 1. Overall, our results highlight that the implicit bias of
Adam crucially depends on both the batching scheme and the dataset, while
Signum remains invariant.

*Ruilin Tong,Haodong Lu,Yuhang Liu,Dong Gong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需数据的持续学习方法，通过模型反演生成伪数据来避免存储历史数据，解决了传统持续学习中的隐私和存储问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统持续学习需要存储和重放历史数据，但在隐私保护或安全约束下不可行。对于预训练模型，存储历史数据也不现实。因此需要无需数据的持续学习方法。

Method: 提出分层模型反演(PMI)来高效生成伪数据，通过高斯分布和对比学习建模类别特征以减少特征偏移，结合语义感知投影特征生成伪图像。

Result: 该方法在多个持续学习设置中表现出色，能够有效学习新类别同时保持对先前知识的记忆，与现有方法兼容性好。

Conclusion: 通过模型反演和特征建模的结合，实现了高效且有效的无需数据持续学习，特别适用于大型预训练模型如CLIP。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to incrementally train a model on a sequence of
tasks while retaining performance on prior ones. However, storing and replaying
data is often infeasible due to privacy or security constraints and impractical
for arbitrary pre-trained models. Data-free CL seeks to update models without
access to previous data. Beyond regularization, we employ model inversion to
synthesize data from the trained model, enabling replay without storing
samples. Yet, model inversion in predictive models faces two challenges: (1)
generating inputs solely from compressed output labels causes drift between
synthetic and real data, and replaying such data can erode prior knowledge; (2)
inversion is computationally expensive since each step backpropagates through
the full model. These issues are amplified in large pre-trained models such as
CLIP. To improve efficiency, we propose Per-layer Model Inversion (PMI),
inspired by faster convergence in single-layer optimization. PMI provides
strong initialization for full-model inversion, substantially reducing
iterations. To mitigate feature shift, we model class-wise features via
Gaussian distributions and contrastive model, ensuring alignment between
synthetic and real features. Combining PMI and feature modeling, our approach
enables continual learning of new classes by generating pseudo-images from
semantic-aware projected features, achieving strong effectiveness and
compatibility across multiple CL settings.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了使用量子退火训练支持向量机(SVM)的方法，将SVM训练转化为QUBO问题，并研究了量子比特数量对预测性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索量子退火在SVM训练中的应用潜力，特别是了解量子比特数量（对应参数离散化水平）如何影响模型性能。

Method: 将SVM训练转化为QUBO问题，使用量子退火进行模型优化，比较不同比特精度（如1比特/参数）的编码效果，并与经典LIBSVM求解器进行对比。

Result: 研究发现即使低精度QUBO编码（如1比特/参数）也能获得竞争性甚至更优的准确率；增加比特深度虽然能支持更大的正则化参数，但并不总能改善分类性能。

Conclusion: 选择合适的支持向量可能比精确的权重更重要；虽然当前硬件限制了可求解QUBO问题的规模，但研究结果显示了量子退火在SVM训练中的潜力，随着量子设备的发展将更具前景。

Abstract: Training Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can be formulated as a QUBO problem,
enabling the use of quantum annealing for model optimization. In this work, we
study how the number of qubits - linked to the discretization level of dual
weights - affects predictive performance across datasets. We compare QUBO-based
SVM training to the classical LIBSVM solver and find that even low-precision
QUBO encodings (e.g., 1 bit per parameter) yield competitive, and sometimes
superior, accuracy. While increased bit-depth enables larger regularization
parameters, it does not always improve classification. Our findings suggest
that selecting the right support vectors may matter more than their precise
weighting. Although current hardware limits the size of solvable QUBOs, our
results highlight the potential of quantum annealing for efficient SVM training
as quantum devices scale.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合扩散模型和退火Langevin动力学的方法，在仅需L^4分数误差界的情况下实现多项式时间内的条件采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后验采样在图像修复、去模糊和MRI重建等任务中具有重要应用，但近似后验采样在计算上通常是难解的。现有方法如Langevin动力学对分数估计误差敏感，需要子指数误差界，而扩散模型在无条件设置中仅需L^2误差界。

Method: 结合扩散模型与退火Langevin动力学，在局部或全局对数凹分布条件下进行条件采样。该方法仅要求分数误差满足L^4界。

Result: 证明了该方法能够在多项式时间内实现条件采样，且仅需L^4分数误差界，相比传统Langevin动力学要求的子指数误差界更为宽松。

Conclusion: 通过将扩散模型与退火Langevin动力学相结合，可以在更宽松的分数误差条件下实现高效的条件采样，为后验采样问题提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Given a noisy linear measurement $y = Ax + \xi$ of a distribution $p(x)$, and
a good approximation to the prior $p(x)$, when can we sample from the posterior
$p(x \mid y)$? Posterior sampling provides an accurate and fair framework for
tasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and MRI reconstruction, and several
heuristics attempt to approximate it. Unfortunately, approximate posterior
sampling is computationally intractable in general.
  To sidestep this hardness, we focus on (local or global) log-concave
distributions $p(x)$. In this regime, Langevin dynamics yields posterior
samples when the exact scores of $p(x)$ are available, but it is brittle to
score--estimation error, requiring an MGF bound (sub-exponential error). By
contrast, in the unconditional setting, diffusion models succeed with only an
$L^2$ bound on the score error. We prove that combining diffusion models with
an annealed variant of Langevin dynamics achieves conditional sampling in
polynomial time using merely an $L^4$ bound on the score error.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Enabling continual learning in LLMs remains a key unresolved research
challenge. In a recent announcement, a frontier LLM company made a step towards
this by introducing Agent Skills, a framework that equips agents with new
knowledge based on instructions stored in simple markdown files. Although Agent
Skills can be a very useful tool, we show that they are fundamentally insecure,
since they enable trivially simple prompt injections. We demonstrate how to
hide malicious instructions in long Agent Skill files and referenced scripts to
exfiltrate sensitive data, such as internal files or passwords. Importantly, we
show how to bypass system-level guardrails of a popular coding agent: a benign,
task-specific approval with the "Don't ask again" option can carry over to
closely related but harmful actions. Overall, we conclude that despite ongoing
research efforts and scaling model capabilities, frontier LLMs remain
vulnerable to very simple prompt injections in realistic scenarios. Our code is

Motivation: 现有因果发现方法只能施加结构约束，但可能得出错误因果结论，需要一种能明确约束因果效应方向的方法。

Method: 提出干预约束概念，为线性因果模型量化总因果效应，采用两阶段约束优化方法解决约束优化问题。

Result: 在真实数据集上验证，整合干预约束不仅提高模型准确性，确保与已有发现一致，还能发现原本难以识别的新因果关系。

Conclusion: 干预约束是因果发现的重要补充，能有效整合领域知识，提高模型可解释性和实用性。

Abstract: Incorporating causal knowledge and mechanisms is essential for refining
causal models and improving downstream tasks such as designing new treatments.
In this paper, we introduce a novel concept in causal discovery, termed
interventional constraints, which differs fundamentally from interventional
data. While interventional data require direct perturbations of variables,
interventional constraints encode high-level causal knowledge in the form of
inequality constraints on causal effects. For instance, in the Sachs dataset
(Sachs et al.\ 2005), Akt has been shown to be activated by PIP3, meaning PIP3
exerts a positive causal effect on Akt. Existing causal discovery methods allow
enforcing structural constraints (for example, requiring a causal path from
PIP3 to Akt), but they may still produce incorrect causal conclusions such as
learning that "PIP3 inhibits Akt". Interventional constraints bridge this gap
by explicitly constraining the total causal effect between variable pairs,
ensuring learned models respect known causal influences. To formalize
interventional constraints, we propose a metric to quantify total causal
effects for linear causal models and formulate the problem as a constrained
optimization task, solved using a two-stage constrained optimization method. We
evaluate our approach on real-world datasets and demonstrate that integrating
interventional constraints not only improves model accuracy and ensures
consistency with established findings, making models more explainable, but also
facilitates the discovery of new causal relationships that would otherwise be
costly to identify.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed to optimize
problem-solving by learning actions that maximize rewards, a task that becomes
particularly challenging in random and nonstationary environments. Even
advanced RL algorithms are often limited in their ability to solve problems in
these conditions. In applications such as searching for underwater pollution
clouds with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), RL algorithms must navigate
reward-sparse environments, where actions frequently result in a zero reward.
This paper aims to address these challenges by revisiting and modifying
classical RL approaches to efficiently operate in sparse, randomized, and
nonstationary environments. We systematically study a large number of
modifications, including hierarchical algorithm changes, multigoal learning,
and the integration of a location memory as an external output filter to
prevent state revisits. Our results demonstrate that a modified Monte
Carlo-based approach significantly outperforms traditional Q-learning and two
exhaustive search patterns, illustrating its potential in adapting RL to
complex environments. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning
approaches can be effectively adapted for use in random, nonstationary, and
reward-sparse environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习方法主要支持同构架构变体，无法处理客户端使用根本不同网络类型（如CNN、GNN、MLP）的情况，且忽视了领域分裂问题，导致模型泛化能力差。

Method: 使用图神经网络将异构本地网络表示为有向模型图中的节点和边；引入共享GNN参数化所有架构；基于客户端参数欧氏距离进行聚类；采用两层级聚合策略平衡收敛性和多样性。

Result: 在MedMNIST分类和海马体分割基准测试中，UnifiedFL表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: UnifiedFL有效解决了联邦学习中的架构异构性、统计异构性和领域分裂问题，为异构环境下的协作训练提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a key paradigm for collaborative model
training across multiple clients without sharing raw data, enabling
privacy-preserving applications in areas such as radiology and pathology.
However, works on collaborative training across clients with fundamentally
different neural architectures and non-identically distributed datasets remain
scarce. Existing FL frameworks face several limitations. Despite claiming to
support architectural heterogeneity, most recent FL methods only tolerate
variants within a single model family (e.g., shallower, deeper, or wider CNNs),
still presuming a shared global architecture and failing to accommodate
federations where clients deploy fundamentally different network types (e.g.,
CNNs, GNNs, MLPs). Moreover, existing approaches often address only statistical
heterogeneity while overlooking the domain-fracture problem, where each
client's data distribution differs markedly from that faced at testing time,
undermining model generalizability. When clients use different architectures,
have non-identically distributed data, and encounter distinct test domains,
current methods perform poorly. To address these challenges, we propose
UnifiedFL, a dynamic federated learning framework that represents heterogeneous
local networks as nodes and edges in a directed model graph optimized by a
shared graph neural network (GNN). UnifiedFL introduces (i) a common GNN to
parameterize all architectures, (ii) distance-driven clustering via Euclidean
distances between clients' parameters, and (iii) a two-tier aggregation policy
balancing convergence and diversity. Experiments on MedMNIST classification and
hippocampus segmentation benchmarks demonstrate UnifiedFL's superior
performance. Code and data: https://github.com/basiralab/UnifiedFL

Abstract: Financial forecasting increasingly uses large neural network models, but
their opacity raises challenges for trust and regulatory compliance. We present
several approaches to explainable and reliable AI in finance. \emph{First}, we
describe how Time-LLM, a time series foundation model, uses a prompt to avoid a
wrong directional forecast. \emph{Second}, we show that combining foundation
models for time series forecasting with a reliability estimator can filter our
unreliable predictions. \emph{Third}, we argue for symbolic reasoning encoding
domain rules for transparent justification. These approaches shift emphasize
executing only forecasts that are both reliable and explainable. Experiments on
equity and cryptocurrency data show that the architecture reduces false
positives and supports selective execution. By integrating predictive
performance with reliability estimation and rule-based reasoning, our framework
advances transparent and auditable financial AI systems.

Conclusion: CorVS方法能够克服现有方法的局限性，在真实工业环境中实现可靠的人员识别。

Abstract: Worker location data is key to higher productivity in industrial sites.
Cameras are a promising tool for localization in logistics warehouses since
they also offer valuable environmental contexts such as package status.
However, identifying individuals with only visual data is often impractical.
Accordingly, several prior studies identified people in videos by comparing
their trajectories and wearable sensor measurements. While this approach has
advantages such as independence from appearance, the existing methods may break
down under real-world conditions. To overcome this challenge, we propose CorVS,
a novel data-driven person identification method based on correspondence
between visual tracking trajectories and sensor measurements. Firstly, our deep
learning model predicts correspondence probabilities and reliabilities for
every pair of a trajectory and sensor measurements. Secondly, our algorithm
matches the trajectories and sensor measurements over time using the predicted
probabilities and reliabilities. We developed a dataset with actual warehouse
operations and demonstrated the method's effectiveness for real-world
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平流层突然增温(SSW)是次季节可预报性的关键来源和极端冬季天气的主要驱动因素，但数值天气预报系统在物理表示、初始化和计算需求方面存在限制，而数据驱动方法在复杂三维SSW动力学中的应用仍待探索。

Method: 采用基于流匹配的生成AI模型(FM-Cast)，构建平流层环流时空演变的概率预报系统，使用18个主要SSW事件(1998-2024)进行评估。

Result: FM-Cast能够提前20天准确预报10个SSW事件的发生、强度和形态，集合准确率超过50%，性能与领先的NWP系统相当或更优，在消费级GPU上仅需2分钟即可完成50成员、30天的预报。

Conclusion: 建立了计算高效的平流层异常概率预报范式，展示了生成AI在加深对大气-气候动力学物理理解方面的潜力，并通过理想化实验揭示了SSW可预报性与物理驱动因素的根本联系。

Abstract: Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs) are key sources of subseasonal
predictability and major drivers of extreme winter weather. Yet, their accurate
and efficient forecast remains a persistent challenge for numerical weather
prediction (NWP) systems due to limitations in physical representation,
initialization, and the immense computational demands of ensemble forecasts.
While data-driven forecasting is rapidly evolving, its application to the
complex, three-dimensional dynamics of SSWs, particularly for probabilistic
forecast, remains underexplored. Here, we bridge this gap by developing a Flow
Matching-based generative AI model (FM-Cast) for efficient and skillful
probabilistic forecasting of the spatiotemporal evolution of stratospheric
circulation. Evaluated across 18 major SSW events (1998-2024), FM-Cast
skillfully forecasts the onset, intensity, and morphology of 10 events up to 20
days in advance, achieving ensemble accuracies above 50%. Its performance is
comparable to or exceeds leading NWP systems while requiring only two minutes
for a 50-member, 30-day forecast on a consumer GPU. Furthermore, leveraging
FM-Cast as a scientific tool, we demonstrate through idealized experiments that
SSW predictability is fundamentally linked to its underlying physical drivers,
distinguishing between events forced from the troposphere and those driven by
internal stratospheric dynamics. Our work thus establishes a computationally
efficient paradigm for probabilistic forecasting stratospheric anomalies and
showcases generative AI's potential to deepen the physical understanding of
atmosphere-climate dynamics.

Abstract: Recently, deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has demonstrated
promising performance for solving challenging tasks, such as long-term
dependencies and non-Markovian environments. Its success is partly attributed
to conditioning policies on large fixed context length. However, such large
fixed context lengths may lead to limited exploration efficiency and redundant
information. In this paper, we propose a novel MARL framework to obtain
adaptive and effective contextual information. Specifically, we design a
central agent that dynamically optimizes context length via temporal gradient
analysis, enhancing exploration to facilitate convergence to global optima in
MARL. Furthermore, to enhance the adaptive optimization capability of the
context length, we present an efficient input representation for the central
agent, which effectively filters redundant information. By leveraging a
Fourier-based low-frequency truncation method, we extract global temporal
trends across decentralized agents, providing an effective and efficient
representation of the MARL environment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on long-term
dependency tasks, including PettingZoo, MiniGrid, Google Research Football
(GRF), and StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge v2 (SMACv2).

leveraging shared information to improve generalization, efficiency, and
robustness, especially in data-scarce or high-dimensional scenarios. While deep

Result: 在视频模拟质量和下游视觉规划任务中，CoLA-World匹配或超越了先前的两阶段方法。

Conclusion: CoLA-World为领域建立了一个稳健高效的新范式，成功实现了潜在动作模型与世界模型的联合学习。

Abstract: Adapting pre-trained video generation models into controllable world models
via latent actions is a promising step towards creating generalist world
models. The dominant paradigm adopts a two-stage approach that trains latent
action model (LAM) and the world model separately, resulting in redundant
training and limiting their potential for co-adaptation. A conceptually simple
and appealing idea is to directly replace the forward dynamic model in LAM with
a powerful world model and training them jointly, but it is non-trivial and
prone to representational collapse. In this work, we propose CoLA-World, which
for the first time successfully realizes this synergistic paradigm, resolving
the core challenge in joint learning through a critical warm-up phase that
effectively aligns the representations of the from-scratch LAM with the
pre-trained world model. This unlocks a co-evolution cycle: the world model
acts as a knowledgeable tutor, providing gradients to shape a high-quality LAM,
while the LAM offers a more precise and adaptable control interface to the
world model. Empirically, CoLA-World matches or outperforms prior two-stage
methods in both video simulation quality and downstream visual planning,
establishing a robust and efficient new paradigm for the field.

Abstract: Personalized treatment outcome prediction based on trial data for
small-sample and rare patient groups is critical in precision medicine.
However, the costly trial data limit the prediction performance. To address
this issue, we propose a cross-fidelity knowledge distillation and adaptive
fusion network (CFKD-AFN), which leverages abundant but low-fidelity simulation
data to enhance predictions on scarce but high-fidelity trial data. CFKD-AFN
incorporates a dual-channel knowledge distillation module to extract
complementary knowledge from the low-fidelity model, along with an
attention-guided fusion module to dynamically integrate multi-source
information. Experiments on treatment outcome prediction for the chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease demonstrates significant improvements of CFKD-AFN
over state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy, ranging from 6.67\% to
74.55\%, and strong robustness to varying high-fidelity dataset sizes.
Furthermore, we extend CFKD-AFN to an interpretable variant, enabling the
exploration of latent medical semantics to support clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Graph condensation (GC) has gained significant attention for its ability to
synthesize smaller yet informative graphs. However, existing studies often
overlook the robustness of GC in scenarios where the original graph is
corrupted. In such cases, we observe that the performance of GC deteriorates
significantly, while existing robust graph learning technologies offer only
limited effectiveness. Through both empirical investigation and theoretical
analysis, we reveal that GC is inherently an intrinsic-dimension-reducing
process, synthesizing a condensed graph with lower classification complexity.
Although this property is critical for effective GC performance, it remains
highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. To tackle this vulnerability
and improve GC robustness, we adopt the geometry perspective of graph data
manifold and propose a novel Manifold-constrained Robust Graph Condensation
framework named MRGC. Specifically, we introduce three graph data manifold
learning modules that guide the condensed graph to lie within a smooth,
low-dimensional manifold with minimal class ambiguity, thereby preserving the
classification complexity reduction capability of GC and ensuring robust
performance under universal adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the robustness of \ModelName\ across diverse attack scenarios.

TL;DR: ReSpec系统通过动态调整推测解码配置、通过知识蒸馏演进草稿模型、以及按rollout奖励加权更新，解决了推测解码在强化学习训练中的三个关键问题，在Qwen模型上实现了高达4.5倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型通过强化学习进行适配时，生成阶段消耗超过75%的训练时间。推测解码在服务系统中加速自回归生成，但其在强化学习训练中的行为尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出ReSpec系统，包含三个机制：1) 动态调整推测解码配置；2) 通过知识蒸馏演进草稿模型；3) 按rollout奖励加权更新。

Result: 在Qwen模型(3B-14B)上，ReSpec实现了高达4.5倍的加速，同时保持了奖励收敛和训练稳定性。

Conclusion: ReSpec为基于强化学习的高效LLM适配提供了实用解决方案，成功将推测解码技术适配到强化学习系统中。

Abstract: Adapting large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL) is
often bottlenecked by the generation stage, which can consume over 75\% of the
training time. Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates autoregressive generation
in serving systems, but its behavior under RL training remains largely
unexplored. We identify three critical gaps that hinder the naive integration
of SD into RL systems: diminishing speedups at large batch sizes, drafter
staleness under continual actor updates, and drafter-induced policy
degradation.
  To address these gaps, we present ReSpec, a system that adapts SD to RL
through three complementary mechanisms: dynamically tuning SD configurations,
evolving the drafter via knowledge distillation, and weighting updates by
rollout rewards. On Qwen models (3B--14B), ReSpec achieves up to 4.5x speedup
while preserving reward convergence and training stability, providing a
practical solution for efficient RL-based LLM adaptation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于量子门控循环单元(QGRU)的生成对抗网络，采用连续数据注入和多度量门控策略，用于网络时间序列异常检测，在基准数据集上取得了89.43%的高时间序列感知F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决时间序列数据异常检测的关键挑战，特别是在网络安全领域。现有量子机器学习方法受限于量子比特数量，需要开发更高效的量子异常检测模型。

Method: 使用量子增强的生成器通过重参数化输出高斯分布的参数(均值和log方差)，结合Wasserstein判别器稳定对抗训练。采用新颖的门控机制，先基于高斯不确定性估计标记潜在异常，再通过判别器分数和重构误差进行验证。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了量子增强模型在时间序列异常检测中的优越性能，为量子机器学习在网络安全领域的实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in time-series data is a critical challenge with
significant implications for network security. Recent quantum machine learning
approaches, such as quantum kernel methods and variational quantum circuits,
have shown promise in capturing complex data distributions for anomaly
detection but remain constrained by limited qubit counts. We introduce in this
work a novel Quantum Gated Recurrent Unit (QGRU)-based Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) employing Successive Data Injection (SuDaI) and a multi-metric
gating strategy for robust network anomaly detection. Our model uniquely
utilizes a quantum-enhanced generator that outputs parameters (mean and
log-variance) of a Gaussian distribution via reparameterization, combined with
a Wasserstein critic to stabilize adversarial training. Anomalies are
identified through a novel gating mechanism that initially flags potential
anomalies based on Gaussian uncertainty estimates and subsequently verifies
them using a composite of critic scores and reconstruction errors. Evaluated on
benchmark datasets, our method achieves a high time-series aware F1 score
(TaF1) of 89.43% demonstrating superior capability in detecting anomalies
accurately and promptly as compared to existing classical and quantum models.
Furthermore, the trained QGRU-WGAN was deployed on real IBM Quantum hardware,
where it retained high anomaly detection performance, confirming its robustness
and practical feasibility on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)
devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLVR中的数据选择方法主要基于启发式，缺乏理论保证和泛化性，需要理论支撑的高效数据选择方法。

Method: 使用影响函数估计数据点对学习目标的贡献，采用离策略影响估计避免策略rollout的计算开销，利用稀疏随机投影降低LLM高维梯度维度，构建多阶段RL框架迭代选择最有影响力的数据。

Result: 在7B参数模型上验证，1.5B模型实现2.66倍步级加速，每个阶段仅使用10%数据，相比全数据集训练显著提升效率。

Conclusion: 基于影响的数据选择方法在高效RLVR中具有巨大潜力，CROPI框架为理论指导的数据选择提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Data selection is a critical aspect of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). Current data selection methods are largely heuristic-based,
lacking theoretical guarantees and generalizability. This work proposes a
theoretically-grounded approach using influence functions to estimate the
contribution of each data point to the learning objective. To overcome the
prohibitive computational cost of policy rollouts required for online influence
estimation, we introduce an off-policy influence estimation method that
efficiently approximates data influence using pre-collected offline
trajectories. Furthermore, to manage the high-dimensional gradients of LLMs, we
employ sparse random projection to reduce dimensionality and improve storage
and computation efficiency. Leveraging these techniques, we develop
\textbf{C}urriculum \textbf{R}L with \textbf{O}ff-\textbf{P}olicy
\text{I}nfluence guidance (\textbf{CROPI}), a multi-stage RL framework that
iteratively selects the most influential data for the current policy.
Experiments on models up to 7B parameters demonstrate that CROPI significantly
accelerates training. On a 1.5B model, it achieves a 2.66x step-level
acceleration while using only 10\% of the data per stage compared to
full-dataset training. Our results highlight the substantial potential of
influence-based data selection for efficient RLVR.

TL;DR: 本文研究无监督异常检测作为上游过滤机制，在资源受限的可穿戴设备上提高心电图分析的可靠性，通过神经架构搜索优化多种UAD方法，发现Deep SVDD在检测性能和效率间达到最佳平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可穿戴设备的心电图监测对心血管疾病早期检测很重要，但标准分类器对分布外数据会产生高置信度的错误预测，影响患者安全。现有方法要么忽略计算限制，要么单独处理噪声和未见类别。

Method: 使用神经架构搜索在严格资源约束下优化六种无监督异常检测方法，包括Deep SVDD、重构模型、掩码异常检测、归一化流和扩散模型，参数不超过512k。

Result: Deep SVDD在检测性能和效率间达到最佳平衡。在实际部署模拟中，将优化的Deep SVDD过滤器与诊断分类器集成，比仅使用分类器的基线准确率提高了21个百分点。

Conclusion: 优化的无监督异常检测过滤器可以保护自动心电图分析，使可穿戴设备上的连续心血管监测更安全可靠。

Abstract: Continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring via wearables offers
significant potential for early cardiovascular disease (CVD) detection.
However, deploying deep learning models for automated analysis in
resource-constrained environments faces reliability challenges due to
inevitable Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. OOD inputs, such as unseen
pathologies or noisecorrupted signals, often cause erroneous, high-confidence
predictions by standard classifiers, compromising patient safety. Existing OOD
detection methods either neglect computational constraints or address noise and
unseen classes separately. This paper explores Unsupervised Anomaly Detection
(UAD) as an independent, upstream filtering mechanism to improve robustness. We
benchmark six UAD approaches, including Deep SVDD, reconstruction-based models,
Masked Anomaly Detection, normalizing flows, and diffusion models, optimized
via Neural Architecture Search (NAS) under strict resource constraints (at most
512k parameters). Evaluation on PTB-XL and BUT QDB datasets assessed detection
of OOD CVD classes and signals unsuitable for analysis due to noise. Results
show Deep SVDD consistently achieves the best trade-off between detection and
efficiency. In a realistic deployment simulation, integrating the optimized
Deep SVDD filter with a diagnostic classifier improved accuracy by up to 21
percentage points over a classifier-only baseline. This study demonstrates that
optimized UAD filters can safeguard automated ECG analysis, enabling safer,
more reliable continuous cardiovascular monitoring on wearables.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型和超参数选择在机器学习中至关重要但具有挑战性，通常需要专家直觉或昂贵的自动搜索，研究旨在探索LLMs是否能解决这一问题。

Method: 将每个数据集转换为可解释元数据，采用两种提示策略：零样本模式（仅依赖预训练知识）和元信息模式（增强过往任务中模型性能示例），让LLM推荐模型族和超参数。

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试中，LLMs能够利用数据集元数据推荐具有竞争力的模型和超参数而无需搜索，元信息提示的改进展示了其上下文元学习能力。

Conclusion: LLMs作为轻量级通用助手在模型选择和超参数优化方面展现出有前景的新角色。

Abstract: Model and hyperparameter selection are critical but challenging in machine
learning, typically requiring expert intuition or expensive automated search.
We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can act as in-context
meta-learners for this task. By converting each dataset into interpretable
metadata, we prompt an LLM to recommend both model families and
hyperparameters. We study two prompting strategies: (1) a zero-shot mode
relying solely on pretrained knowledge, and (2) a meta-informed mode augmented
with examples of models and their performance on past tasks. Across synthetic
and real-world benchmarks, we show that LLMs can exploit dataset metadata to
recommend competitive models and hyperparameters without search, and that
improvements from meta-informed prompting demonstrate their capacity for
in-context meta-learning. These results highlight a promising new role for LLMs
as lightweight, general-purpose assistants for model selection and
hyperparameter optimization.

Motivation: 现有RLVR方法如GRPO由于依赖当前策略分布而探索受限，轨迹多样性不足。引入专家模型轨迹会增加计算成本且高级模型通常不可用。

Method: ICPO框架：1) 混合策略GRPO与隐式专家引导，扩展探索范围；2) 专家区域拒绝采样，过滤不可靠轨迹；3) 退火专家奖励塑形，平衡早期指导和后期自主改进。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，ICPO持续提升强化学习性能和训练稳定性。

Conclusion: ICPO为LRMs提供了一个可扩展且有效的RLVR范式，无需依赖高级模型即可增强探索能力。

Abstract: Existing Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods, such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have achieved remarkable progress
in improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs).
However, they exhibit limited exploration due to reliance on on-policy rollouts
where confined to the current policy's distribution, resulting in narrow
trajectory diversity. Recent approaches attempt to expand policy coverage by
incorporating trajectories generated from stronger expert models, yet this
reliance increases computational cost and such advaned models are often
inaccessible. To address these issues, we propose In-Context Steered Policy
Optimization (ICPO), a unified framework that leverages the inherent in-context
learning capability of LRMs to provide expert guidance using existing datasets.
ICPO introduces Mixed-Policy GRPO with Implicit Expert Forcing, which expands
exploration beyond the current policy distribution without requiring advanced
LRM trajectories. To further stabilize optimization, ICPO integrates Expert
Region Reject Sampling to filter unreliable off-policy trajectories and
Annealed Expert-Bonus Reward Shaping to balance early expert guidance with
later autonomous improvement. Results demonstrate that ICPO consistently
enhances reinforcement learning performance and training stability on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, revealing a scalable and effective RLVR
paradigm for LRMs.

Conclusion: 多基础推测解码框架在保持输出分布不变的前提下显著加速推理，为超越二元化方法提供了理论基础和实践方案。

Abstract: Inference latency stands as a critical bottleneck in the large-scale
deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). Speculative decoding methods have
recently shown promise in accelerating inference without compromising the
output distribution. However, existing work typically relies on a dualistic
draft-verify framework and lacks rigorous theoretical grounding. In this paper,
we introduce a novel \emph{polybasic} speculative decoding framework,
underpinned by a comprehensive theoretical analysis. Specifically, we prove a
fundamental theorem that characterizes the optimal inference time for
multi-model speculative decoding systems, shedding light on how to extend
beyond the dualistic approach to a more general polybasic paradigm. Through our
theoretical investigation of multi-model token generation, we expose and
optimize the interplay between model capabilities, acceptance lengths, and
overall computational cost. Our framework supports both standalone
implementation and integration with existing speculative techniques, leading to
accelerated performance in practice. Experimental results across multiple model
families demonstrate that our approach yields speedup ratios ranging from
$3.31\times$ to $4.01\times$ for LLaMA2-Chat 7B, up to $3.87 \times$ for
LLaMA3-8B, up to $4.43 \times$ for Vicuna-7B and up to $3.85 \times$ for
Qwen2-7B -- all while preserving the original output distribution. We release
our theoretical proofs and implementation code to facilitate further
investigation into polybasic speculative decoding.

Conclusion: HOHL在不同学习设置中具有多功能性和鲁棒性，为超图学习提供了坚实的理论基础和实用价值。

Abstract: Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL) was recently introduced as a
principled alternative to classical hypergraph regularization, enforcing
higher-order smoothness via powers of multiscale Laplacians induced by the
hypergraph structure. Prior work established the well- and ill-posedness of
HOHL through an asymptotic consistency analysis in geometric settings. We
extend this theoretical foundation by proving the consistency of a truncated
version of HOHL and deriving explicit convergence rates when HOHL is used as a
regularizer in fully supervised learning. We further demonstrate its strong
empirical performance in active learning and in datasets lacking an underlying
geometric structure, highlighting HOHL's versatility and robustness across
diverse learning settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种分阶段贝叶斯域对抗神经网络(staged B-DANN)，通过三阶段框架结合参数迁移和共享潜在空间适应，解决深度神经网络在领域转移下的性能下降和不确定性量化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络需要大量高质量数据，但实验数据往往稀疏、有噪声或不足。传统参数迁移方法在大领域转移下性能下降，域对抗神经网络(DANNs)虽能改善但训练不稳定且缺乏不确定性量化能力。

Method: 三阶段框架：1)在源域训练确定性特征提取器；2)使用DANN对抗性精炼特征提取器；3)在适应后的特征提取器上构建贝叶斯神经网络，在目标域上进行微调以处理条件偏移并提供校准的不确定性估计。

Result: 在合成基准测试中显著优于标准迁移技术，在矩形通道临界热通量预测任务中，利用管实验数据作为源域，提高了预测精度和泛化能力。

Conclusion: staged B-DANN方法能够提高预测准确性和泛化能力，有望帮助核工程等其他领域的应用。

Abstract: The use of ML in engineering has grown steadily to support a wide array of
applications. Among these methods, deep neural networks have been widely
adopted due to their performance and accessibility, but they require large,
high-quality datasets. Experimental data are often sparse, noisy, or
insufficient to build resilient data-driven models. Transfer learning, which
leverages relevant data-abundant source domains to assist learning in
data-scarce target domains, has shown efficacy. Parameter transfer, where
pretrained weights are reused, is common but degrades under large domain
shifts. Domain-adversarial neural networks (DANNs) help address this issue by
learning domain-invariant representations, thereby improving transfer under
greater domain shifts in a semi-supervised setting. However, DANNs can be
unstable during training and lack a native means for uncertainty
quantification. This study introduces a fully-supervised three-stage framework,
the staged Bayesian domain-adversarial neural network (staged B-DANN), that
combines parameter transfer and shared latent space adaptation. In Stage 1, a
deterministic feature extractor is trained on the source domain. This feature
extractor is then adversarially refined using a DANN in Stage 2. In Stage 3, a
Bayesian neural network is built on the adapted feature extractor for
fine-tuning on the target domain to handle conditional shifts and yield
calibrated uncertainty estimates. This staged B-DANN approach was first
validated on a synthetic benchmark, where it was shown to significantly
outperform standard transfer techniques. It was then applied to the task of
predicting critical heat flux in rectangular channels, leveraging data from
tube experiments as the source domain. The results of this study show that the
staged B-DANN method can improve predictive accuracy and generalization,
potentially assisting other domains in nuclear engineering.

Abstract: Deploying machine learning models on compute-constrained devices has become a
key building block of modern IoT applications. In this work, we present a
compression scheme for boosted decision trees, addressing the growing need for
lightweight machine learning models. Specifically, we provide techniques for
training compact boosted decision tree ensembles that exhibit a reduced memory
footprint by rewarding, among other things, the reuse of features and
thresholds during training. Our experimental evaluation shows that models
achieved the same performance with a compression ratio of 4-16x compared to
LightGBM models using an adapted training process and an alternative memory
layout. Once deployed, the corresponding IoT devices can operate independently
of constant communication or external energy supply, and, thus, autonomously,
requiring only minimal computing power and energy. This capability opens the
door to a wide range of IoT applications, including remote monitoring, edge
analytics, and real-time decision making in isolated or power-limited

Conclusion: 改进表示学习是构建鲁棒世界模型的直接有效途径，无需扩大动态模块即可实现可靠的长期预测

Abstract: A world model is an internal model that simulates how the world evolves.
Given past observations and actions, it predicts the future of both the
embodied agent and its environment. Accurate world models are essential for
enabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic
settings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and
degrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation
quality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or
entangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask
whether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve
world-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly
accurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing
a model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We
propose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that
consecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent
representation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent
representations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.
GRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales
with trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative
backbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,
GRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that
its benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric
structure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation
learning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering
reliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了深度网络中捷径学习（shortcut learning）的层级定位问题，发现捷径学习并非集中在特定层，而是分布在整个网络中，浅层主要编码虚假特征，深层主要遗忘核心特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 捷径（虚假规则）在训练时表现良好但泛化能力差，是深度网络可靠性的主要挑战。然而捷径对特征表示的影响研究不足，阻碍了设计原则性捷径缓解方法。

Method: 通过新颖的实验设计量化由捷径诱导偏差导致的准确率下降的层级贡献，通过对比在干净和偏差数据集上的训练来进行反事实分析，在CIFAR-10、Waterbirds和CelebA数据集上使用VGG、ResNet、DeiT和ConvNeXt架构进行研究。

Conclusion: 层级捷径缓解策略的分析表明设计通用方法很困难，建议采用数据集和架构特定的方法。

Abstract: Shortcuts, spurious rules that perform well during training but fail to
generalize, present a major challenge to the reliability of deep networks
(Geirhos et al., 2020). However, the impact of shortcuts on feature
representations remains understudied, obstructing the design of principled
shortcut-mitigation methods. To overcome this limitation, we investigate the
layer-wise localization of shortcuts in deep models. Our novel experiment
design quantifies the layer-wise contribution to accuracy degradation caused by
a shortcut-inducing skew by counterfactual training on clean and skewed
datasets. We employ our design to study shortcuts on CIFAR-10, Waterbirds, and
CelebA datasets across VGG, ResNet, DeiT, and ConvNeXt architectures. We find
that shortcut learning is not localized in specific layers but distributed
throughout the network. Different network parts play different roles in this
process: shallow layers predominantly encode spurious features, while deeper
layers predominantly forget core features that are predictive on clean data. We
also analyze the differences in localization and describe its principal axes of
variation. Finally, our analysis of layer-wise shortcut-mitigation strategies
suggests the hardness of designing general methods, supporting dataset- and
architecture-specific approaches instead.

probabilities to be well-calibrated, meaning they should reflect true-class
frequencies. Among calibration notions in multiclass classification, strong
calibration is the most stringent, as it requires all predicted probabilities
to be simultaneously calibrated across all classes. However, existing
approaches to multiclass calibration lack a notion of distance among inputs,
which makes them vulnerable to proximity bias: predictions in sparse regions of
the feature space are systematically miscalibrated. This is especially relevant
in high-stakes settings, such as healthcare, where the sparse instances are
exactly those most at risk of biased treatment. In this work, we address this
main shortcoming by introducing a local perspective on multiclass calibration.
First, we formally define multiclass local calibration and establish its
relationship with strong calibration. Second, we theoretically analyze the
pitfalls of existing evaluation metrics when applied to multiclass local
calibration. Third, we propose a practical method for enhancing local
calibration in Neural Networks, which enforces alignment between predicted
probabilities and local estimates of class frequencies using the Jensen-Shannon
distance. Finally, we empirically validate our approach against existing
multiclass calibration techniques.

### [284] [Wasserstein Regression as a Variational Approximation of Probabilistic Trajectories through the Bernstein Basis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26607)
*Maksim Maslov,Alexander Kugaevskikh,Matthew Ivanov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合伯恩斯坦基参数化和Wasserstein距离最小化的分布回归新方法，通过高斯分量和Bernstein多项式构建平滑概率轨迹，在保持几何精度的同时提供计算实用性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分布回归方法要么忽略概率空间的几何结构，要么计算成本高昂，需要一种兼顾几何精度和计算效率的平衡解决方案。

Method: 使用Bernstein基参数化概率轨迹，将条件分布建模为由高斯分量加权和构成的平滑轨迹，均值和协方差通过Bernstein多项式构造，损失函数采用平均平方Wasserstein距离，基于自动微分的优化方法进行训练。

Result: 在包含复杂轨迹的合成数据集上实验表明，该方法在Wasserstein距离、能量距离和RMSE指标上具有竞争力的近似质量，特别是在显著非线性情况下，轨迹平滑度优于或可与替代方法相比，对数据结构变化具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法代表了几何精度、计算实用性和可解释性的平衡解决方案，未来研究方向包括扩展到非高斯分布、应用熵正则化加速计算，以及适应高维数据近似曲面和更复杂结构。

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of regression over distributions, which is
becoming increasingly important in machine learning. Existing approaches often
ignore the geometry of the probability space or are computationally expensive.
To overcome these limitations, a new method is proposed that combines the
parameterization of probability trajectories using a Bernstein basis and the
minimization of the Wasserstein distance between distributions. The key idea is
to model a conditional distribution as a smooth probability trajectory defined
by a weighted sum of Gaussian components whose parameters -- the mean and
covariance -- are functions of the input variable constructed using Bernstein
polynomials. The loss function is the averaged squared Wasserstein distance
between the predicted Gaussian distributions and the empirical data, which
takes into account the geometry of the distributions. An autodiff-based
optimization method is used to train the model. Experiments on synthetic
datasets that include complex trajectories demonstrated that the proposed
method provides competitive approximation quality in terms of the Wasserstein
distance, Energy Distance, and RMSE metrics, especially in cases of pronounced
nonlinearity. The model demonstrates trajectory smoothness that is better than
or comparable to alternatives and robustness to changes in data structure,
while maintaining high interpretability due to explicit parameterization via
control points. The developed approach represents a balanced solution that
combines geometric accuracy, computational practicality, and interpretability.
Prospects for further research include extending the method to non-Gaussian
distributions, applying entropy regularization to speed up computations, and
adapting the approach to working with high-dimensional data for approximating
surfaces and more complex structures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战序列建模中参数记忆仅存储局部共现关联的传统观点，探索记忆如何形成几何结构来编码全局实体关系。

Method: 通过分析Transformer推理实例，对比关联记忆与几何记忆的差异，并建立与Node2Vec的联系来理解几何结构的形成机制。

Result: 发现Transformer会自发学习优雅的几何结构来编码全局关系，即使这种结构不比关联查找更简洁。这种几何结构源于谱偏置，而非典型的架构或优化压力。

Conclusion: 几何视角为参数记忆提供了新的理解框架，建议重新审视知识获取、容量、发现和遗忘等领域的默认直觉。

Abstract: In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has been
predominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences between
entities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how
memory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of
Transformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of
the local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must
have somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global
relationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in
turn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\ell$-fold composition
into an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.
  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding
geometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,
despite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly
attributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.
Counterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more
succinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.
  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry
stems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed
arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also
points to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more
strongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages
revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like
knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.

Abstract: We introduce Aeolus, a large-scale Multi-modal Flight Delay Dataset designed
to advance research on flight delay prediction and support the development of
foundation models for tabular data. Existing datasets in this domain are
typically limited to flat tabular structures and fail to capture the
spatiotemporal dynamics inherent in delay propagation. Aeolus addresses this
limitation by providing three aligned modalities: (i) a tabular dataset with
rich operational, meteorological, and airportlevel features for over 50 million
flights; (ii) a flight chain module that models delay propagation along
sequential flight legs, capturing upstream and downstream dependencies; and
(iii) a flight network graph that encodes shared aircraft, crew, and airport
resource connections, enabling cross-flight relational reasoning. The dataset
is carefully constructed with temporal splits, comprehensive features, and
strict leakage prevention to support realistic and reproducible machine
learning evaluation. Aeolus supports a broad range of tasks, including
regression, classification, temporal structure modeling, and graph learning,
serving as a unified benchmark across tabular, sequential, and graph
modalities. We release baseline experiments and preprocessing tools to
facilitate adoption. Aeolus fills a key gap for both domain-specific modeling
and general-purpose structured data research.Our source code and data can be

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has the potential to solve various combinatorial
tasks, ranging from materials science to neural architecture search. However,
BO requires specialized kernels to effectively model combinatorial domains.
Recent efforts have introduced several combinatorial kernels, but the
relationships among them are not well understood. To bridge this gap, we
develop a unifying framework based on heat kernels, which we derive in a
systematic way and express as simple closed-form expressions. Using this
framework, we prove that many successful combinatorial kernels are either
related or equivalent to heat kernels, and validate this theoretical claim in
our experiments. Moreover, our analysis confirms and extends the results
presented in Bounce: certain algorithms' performance decreases substantially
when the unknown optima of the function do not have a certain structure. In
contrast, heat kernels are not sensitive to the location of the optima. Lastly,
we show that a fast and simple pipeline, relying on heat kernels, is able to
achieve state-of-the-art results, matching or even outperforming certain slow
or complex algorithms.

Motivation: 解决LLM强化学习微调中因浮点精度导致的训练与推理策略不匹配问题，BF16的大动态范围引入的舍入误差破坏了训练一致性。

Method: 简单地将浮点精度从BF16改回FP16，无需修改模型架构或学习算法，仅需几行代码变更。

Result: 使用FP16能实现更稳定的优化、更快的收敛速度，并在多种任务、算法和框架中表现出更强的性能。

Conclusion: FP16在RL微调中优于BF16，建议重新考虑精度权衡问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) often
suffers from instability due to the numerical mismatch between the training and
inference policies. While prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue
through algorithmic corrections or engineering alignments, we show that its
root cause lies in the floating point precision itself. The widely adopted
BF16, despite its large dynamic range, introduces large rounding errors that
breaks the consistency between training and inference. In this work, we
demonstrate that simply reverting to \textbf{FP16} effectively eliminates this
mismatch. The change is simple, fully supported by modern frameworks with only
a few lines of code change, and requires no modification to the model
architecture or learning algorithm. Our results suggest that using FP16
uniformly yields more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger
performance across diverse tasks, algorithms and frameworks. We hope these
findings motivate a broader reconsideration of precision trade-offs in RL
fine-tuning.

Conclusion: 这是首次证明时间序列分类算法在异常检测中准确性和效率的评估，为通用AutoML流程中的模型选择步骤提供了强基准。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a fundamental task for time series analytics with
important implications for the downstream performance of many applications.
Despite increasing academic interest and the large number of methods proposed
in the literature, recent benchmarks and evaluation studies demonstrated that
no overall best anomaly detection methods exist when applied to very
heterogeneous time series datasets. Therefore, the only scalable and viable
solution to solve anomaly detection over very different time series collected
from diverse domains is to propose a model selection method that will select,
based on time series characteristics, the best anomaly detection methods to
run. Existing AutoML solutions are, unfortunately, not directly applicable to
time series anomaly detection, and no evaluation of time series-based
approaches for model selection exists. Towards that direction, this paper
studies the performance of time series classification methods used as model
selection for anomaly detection. In total, we evaluate 234 model configurations
derived from 16 base classifiers across more than 1980 time series, and we
propose the first extensive experimental evaluation of time series
classification as model selection for anomaly detection. Our results
demonstrate that model selection methods outperform every single anomaly
detection method while being in the same order of magnitude regarding execution
time. This evaluation is the first step to demonstrate the accuracy and
efficiency of time series classification algorithms for anomaly detection, and
represents a strong baseline that can then be used to guide the model selection
step in general AutoML pipelines. Preprint version of an article accepted at

Conclusion: Curly-FM将流匹配模型扩展到物理系统中已知周期性行为的建模，超越了仅对群体的建模能力。

Abstract: Modeling the transport dynamics of natural processes from population-level
observations is a ubiquitous problem in the natural sciences. Such models rely
on key assumptions about the underlying process in order to enable faithful
learning of governing dynamics that mimic the actual system behavior. The de
facto assumption in current approaches relies on the principle of least action
that results in gradient field dynamics and leads to trajectories minimizing an
energy functional between two probability measures. However, many real-world
systems, such as cell cycles in single-cell RNA, are known to exhibit
non-gradient, periodic behavior, which fundamentally cannot be captured by
current state-of-the-art methods such as flow and bridge matching. In this
paper, we introduce Curly Flow Matching (Curly-FM), a novel approach that is
capable of learning non-gradient field dynamics by designing and solving a
Schr\"odinger bridge problem with a non-zero drift reference process -- in
stark contrast to typical zero-drift reference processes -- which is
constructed using inferred velocities in addition to population snapshot data.
We showcase Curly-FM by solving the trajectory inference problems for single
cells, computational fluid dynamics, and ocean currents with approximate
velocities. We demonstrate that Curly-FM can learn trajectories that better
match both the reference process and population marginals. Curly-FM expands
flow matching models beyond the modeling of populations and towards the
modeling of known periodic behavior in physical systems. Our code repository is

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Hardt和Roth提出的问题，即在差分隐私下计算矩阵奇异向量跨度时，现有方法在某些情况下无法达到最优非私有算法的性能。

Method: 使用奇异值分解结合标准扰动机制，通过高斯机制保持输入矩阵的相干性不变。

Result: 算法在密集设置下实现了与最优非私有算法相同的单峰PCA保证，且在低相干性假设下可应用于图问题如Max-Cut。

Conclusion: 该方法在差分隐私下实现了与最优非私有算法相当的性能，且相干性在扰动下保持不变，为结构化模型中的私有计算提供了新思路。

Abstract: We revisit the task of computing the span of the top $r$ singular vectors
$u_1, \ldots, u_r$ of a matrix under differential privacy. We show that a
simple and efficient algorithm -- based on singular value decomposition and
standard perturbation mechanisms -- returns a private rank-$r$ approximation
whose error depends only on the \emph{rank-$r$ coherence} of $u_1, \ldots, u_r$
and the spectral gap $\sigma_r - \sigma_{r+1}$. This resolves a question posed
by Hardt and Roth~\cite{hardt2013beyond}. Our estimator outperforms the state
of the art -- significantly so in some regimes. In particular, we show that in
the dense setting, it achieves the same guarantees for single-spike PCA in the
Wishart model as those attained by optimal non-private algorithms, whereas
prior private algorithms failed to do so.
  In addition, we prove that (rank-$r$) coherence does not increase under
Gaussian perturbations. This implies that any estimator based on the Gaussian
mechanism -- including ours -- preserves the coherence of the input. We
conjecture that similar behavior holds for other structured models, including
planted problems in graphs.
  We also explore applications of coherence to graph problems. In particular,
we present a differentially private algorithm for Max-Cut and other constraint
satisfaction problems under low coherence assumptions.

Motivation: LoRA适配器虽然单个轻量，但在大规模部署时多个适配器的聚合成本显著增加，需要有效的量化方法来减少存储开销。

Method: 使用奇异值分解(SVD)重新参数化每个LoRA适配器，将重要信息集中在特定行列，然后对重要组件使用高精度量化，其余部分使用超低位宽量化。

Conclusion: LoRAQuant是一种高效的LoRA适配器量化方法，能够在显著减少存储需求的同时保持或提升模型性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular technique for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). In many
real-world scenarios, multiple adapters are loaded simultaneously to enable LLM
customization for personalized user experiences or to support a diverse range
of tasks. Although each adapter is lightweight in isolation, their aggregate
cost becomes substantial at scale. To address this, we propose LoRAQuant, a
mixed-precision post-training quantization method tailored to LoRA.
Specifically, LoRAQuant reparameterizes each adapter by singular value
decomposition (SVD) to concentrate the most important information into specific
rows and columns. This makes it possible to quantize the important components
to higher precision, while quantizing the rest to ultra-low bitwidth. We
conduct comprehensive experiments with LLaMA 2-7B, LLaMA 2-13B, and Mistral 7B
models on mathematical reasoning, coding, and summarization tasks. Results show
that our LoRAQuant uses significantly lower bits than other quantization
methods, but achieves comparable or even higher performance.

Abstract: Can regularization terms in the training of invertible neural networks lead
to known Bayesian point estimators in reconstruction? Invertible networks are
attractive for inverse problems due to their inherent stability and
interpretability. Recently, optimization strategies for invertible neural
networks that approximate either a reconstruction map or the forward operator
have been studied from a Bayesian perspective, but each has limitations. To
address this, we introduce and analyze two regularization terms for the network
training that, upon inversion of the network, recover properties of classical
Bayesian point estimators: while the first can be connected to the posterior
mean, the second resembles the MAP estimator. Our theoretical analysis
characterizes how each loss shapes both the learned forward operator and its
inverse reconstruction map. Numerical experiments support our findings and
demonstrate how these loss-term regularizers introduce data-dependence in a
stable and interpretable way.

Abstract: Learning to defer uncertain predictions to costly experts offers a powerful
strategy for improving the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning systems.
However, standard training procedures for deferral algorithms typically require
querying all experts for every training instance, an approach that becomes
prohibitively expensive when expert queries incur significant computational or
resource costs. This undermines the core goal of deferral: to limit unnecessary
expert usage. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the budgeted deferral
framework, which aims to train effective deferral algorithms while minimizing
expert query costs during training. We propose new algorithms for both
two-stage and single-stage multiple-expert deferral settings that selectively
query only a subset of experts per training example. While inspired by active
learning, our setting is fundamentally different: labels are already known, and
the core challenge is to decide which experts to query in order to balance cost
and predictive performance. We establish theoretical guarantees for both of our
algorithms, including generalization bounds and label complexity analyses.
Empirical results across several domains show that our algorithms substantially
reduce training costs without sacrificing prediction accuracy, demonstrating
the practical value of our budget-aware deferral algorithms.

Conclusion: ARC-Top-K结合了Rand-K的鲁棒性和Top-K的强性能，提供了高效可扩展的通信优化解决方案

Abstract: Communication remains a central bottleneck in large-scale distributed machine
learning, and gradient sparsification has emerged as a promising strategy to
alleviate this challenge. However, existing gradient compressors face notable
limitations: Rand-$K$\ discards structural information and performs poorly in
practice, while Top-$K$\ preserves informative entries but loses the
contraction property and requires costly All-Gather operations. In this paper,
we propose ARC-Top-$K$, an {All-Reduce}-Compatible Top-$K$ compressor that
aligns sparsity patterns across nodes using a lightweight sketch of the
gradient, enabling index-free All-Reduce while preserving globally significant
information. ARC-Top-$K$\ is provably contractive and, when combined with
momentum error feedback (EF21M), achieves linear speedup and sharper
convergence rates than the original EF21M under standard assumptions.
Empirically, ARC-Top-$K$\ matches the accuracy of Top-$K$\ while reducing
wall-clock training time by up to 60.7\%, offering an efficient and scalable
solution that combines the robustness of Rand-$K$\ with the strong performance
of Top-$K$.

Result: 研究发现某些MU方法对模型训练时使用的随机数种子高度敏感，导致从同一模型多次运行MU算法会产生非代表性结果。

Conclusion: 建议在MU算法的经验比较中，不仅要考虑从同一模型的多次运行，还要反映不同训练种子带来的变异性，以获得更准确的评估结果。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of certain data points
from a trained model without costly retraining. Most practical MU algorithms
are only approximate and their performance can only be assessed empirically.
Care must therefore be taken to make empirical comparisons as representative as
possible. A common practice is to run the MU algorithm multiple times
independently starting from the same trained model. In this work, we
demonstrate that this practice can give highly non-representative results
because -- even for the same architecture and same dataset -- some MU methods
can be highly sensitive to the choice of random number seed used for model
training. We therefore recommend that empirical
comphttps://info.arxiv.org/help/prep#commentsarisons of MU algorithms should
also reflect the variability across different model training seeds.

TL;DR: 提出一种简单的扰动机制，用于在纯差分隐私下发布d维协方差矩阵，在不同数据集规模下均能实现最优误差保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的差分隐私协方差估计方法在不同p-Schatten范数下的误差保证不够理想，特别是在小数据集情况下，需要改进误差界限。

Method: 使用简单的扰动机制，对于大数据集直接应用，对于小数据集通过投影到适当半径的核范数球上来优化结果。

Result: 对于大数据集(n≥d²/ε)，在所有p-Schatten范数下达到最优误差；对于小数据集(n<d²/ε)，在Frobenius范数下达到最优误差O(√(dTr(Σ)/n))。

Conclusion: 该机制是第一个在纯差分隐私下实现谱范数最优误差的协方差估计器，在不同数据集规模下均能提供信息理论最优的误差保证。

Abstract: We present a simple perturbation mechanism for the release of $d$-dimensional
covariance matrices $\Sigma$ under pure differential privacy. For large
datasets with at least $n\geq d^2/\varepsilon$ elements, our mechanism recovers
the provably optimal Frobenius norm error guarantees of
\cite{nikolov2023private}, while simultaneously achieving best known error for
all other $p$-Schatten norms, with $p\in [1,\infty]$. Our error is
information-theoretically optimal for all $p\ge 2$, in particular, our
mechanism is the first purely private covariance estimator that achieves
optimal error in spectral norm.
  For small datasets $n< d^2/\varepsilon$, we further show that by projecting
the output onto the nuclear norm ball of appropriate radius, our algorithm
achieves the optimal Frobenius norm error $O(\sqrt{d\;\text{Tr}(\Sigma) /n})$,
improving over the known bounds of $O(\sqrt{d/n})$ of \cite{nikolov2023private}
and ${O}\big(d^{3/4}\sqrt{\text{Tr}(\Sigma)/n}\big)$ of
\cite{dong2022differentially}.

*Muhammad Faraz Ul Abrar,Nicolò Michelusi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了在无线异构环境下基于过空中计算(OTA)的联邦学习(FL)，提出了允许结构化模型偏差的OTA-FL SGD更新方法，并开发了优化偏差-方差权衡的功率控制设计算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OTA-FL设计在无线异构场景下受限于最弱设备并增大更新方差，且先前对偏差OTA-FL的分析主要针对凸目标函数，而现代AI模型多为高度非凸。

Method: 开发了允许时间不变模型偏差的OTA-FL SGD更新方法，提出了基于统计CSI的非凸联合OTA功率控制设计，并采用逐次凸逼近(SCA)算法进行优化。

Result: 在非凸图像分类任务上的实验验证了该方法：基于SCA的设计通过优化偏差加速收敛，并在泛化性能上优于先前的OTA-FL基线方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为无线异构环境下的OTA-FL提供了有效的偏差-方差权衡优化方案，显著提升了非凸模型的训练效率和性能。

Abstract: Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a
scalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless
multiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing
OTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming
\emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or
forcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \emph{heterogeneous}
wireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device
and inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL
largely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly
non-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless
heterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured,
time-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We
derive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient
norm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this
trade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an
efficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only
statistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image
classification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates
convergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL
baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出STaMP量化方法，通过在序列维度应用线性变换并混合精度，在低比特激活量化下保持模型精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化是减少生成式AI模型推理延迟、功耗和内存占用的关键方法，但激活量化到8位以下时精度会急剧下降

Method: STaMP量化在序列维度应用线性变换，利用语言和视觉数据的强局部相关性，在中间激活中保持少量token的高精度

Result: 在最近的LVM和LLM架构上评估，显著改善了低比特激活量化，并与现有量化方法互补

Conclusion: STaMP量化是一种有效的低比特激活量化策略，能够保持模型精度

Abstract: Quantization is the key method for reducing inference latency, power and
memory footprint of generative AI models. However, accuracy often degrades
sharply when activations are quantized below eight bits. Recent work suggests
that invertible linear transformations (e.g. rotations) can aid quantization,
by reparameterizing feature channels and weights. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Sequence Transformation and Mixed Precision} (STaMP) quantization, a
novel strategy that applies linear transformations along the \textit{sequence}
dimension to exploit the strong local correlation in language and visual data.
By keeping a small number of tokens in each intermediate activation at higher
precision, we can maintain model accuracy at lower (average) activations
bit-widths. We evaluate STaMP on recent LVM and LLM architectures,
demonstrating that it significantly improves low bit width activation
quantization and complements established activation and weight quantization
methods including recent feature transformations.

TL;DR: 提出两种基于特征和logits的采样方法，用于改进影响函数估计，减少计算时间和内存使用，同时提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统影响函数计算需要整个数据集的Hessian矩阵，计算资源消耗大。随机采样方法方差高，估计结果不一致。

Method: 使用基于特征和logits的采样技术，选择具有代表性的数据子集来近似Hessian矩阵，减少计算负担。

Result: 计算时间减少30.1%，内存使用减少42.2%，或F1分数提高2.5%。

Conclusion: 提出的采样方法能有效改进影响函数估计，在保持准确性的同时显著降低计算成本。

Abstract: How can we explain the influence of training data on black-box models?
Influence functions (IFs) offer a post-hoc solution by utilizing gradients and
Hessians. However, computing the Hessian for an entire dataset is
resource-intensive, necessitating a feasible alternative. A common approach
involves randomly sampling a small subset of the training data, but this method
often results in highly inconsistent IF estimates due to the high variance in
sample configurations. To address this, we propose two advanced sampling
techniques based on features and logits. These samplers select a small yet
representative subset of the entire dataset by considering the stochastic
distribution of features or logits, thereby enhancing the accuracy of IF
estimations. We validate our approach through class removal experiments, a
typical application of IFs, using the F1-score to measure how effectively the
model forgets the removed class while maintaining inference consistency on the
remaining classes. Our method reduces computation time by 30.1% and memory
usage by 42.2%, or improves the F1-score by 2.5% compared to the baseline.

Motivation: 探索预训练的时序预测模型学习到的表示是否具有通用性，特别是能否有效用于分类任务。

Method: 比较不同的表示提取策略，并引入两种模型无关的嵌入增强方法。

Result: 最佳预测模型在分类准确率上达到或超过了专门为分类预训练的最先进模型，且预测性能与分类性能呈正相关。

Conclusion: 学习预测可能是构建通用时序基础模型的有效途径，任务特定预训练可能并非必要。

Abstract: Recent research on time series foundation models has primarily focused on
forecasting, leaving it unclear how generalizable their learned representations
are. In this study, we examine whether frozen pre-trained forecasting models
can provide effective representations for classification. To this end, we
compare different representation extraction strategies and introduce two
model-agnostic embedding augmentations. Our experiments show that the best
forecasting models achieve classification accuracy that matches or even
surpasses that of state-of-the-art models pre-trained specifically for
classification. Moreover, we observe a positive correlation between forecasting
and classification performance. These findings challenge the assumption that
task-specific pre-training is necessary, and suggest that learning to forecast
may provide a powerful route toward constructing general-purpose time series
foundation models.

TL;DR: Transformer模型能够学习Permuted Congruential Generators (PCGs)生成的序列，即使输出被截断到单个比特也能可靠预测。模型展现了对不同PCG变体的联合学习能力，并揭示了模数m的平方根缩放规律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformer模型学习复杂伪随机数生成器(PCGs)序列的能力，PCGs通过比特移位、异或、旋转和截断操作增加了比线性同余生成器更大的难度。

Method: 使用Transformer模型进行上下文预测，在实验中扩展到模数2^22，使用5000万参数和50亿token的数据集。采用课程学习策略，从小模数开始训练逐步过渡到大模数。

Result: 模型能够成功预测未见过的PCG序列，即使输出截断到单个比特。发现预测所需上下文序列长度与模数m的平方根成正比。对于大模数(m≥2^20)，需要课程学习才能成功训练。

Conclusion: Transformer能够学习复杂的PCG序列，揭示了模数的平方根缩放规律和课程学习的必要性。模型自发地将整数输入分组为比特旋转不变簇，展示了表示从小模数到大模数的迁移能力。

Abstract: We study the ability of Transformer models to learn sequences generated by
Permuted Congruential Generators (PCGs), a widely used family of pseudo-random
number generators (PRNGs). PCGs introduce substantial additional difficulty
over linear congruential generators (LCGs) by applying a series of bit-wise
shifts, XORs, rotations and truncations to the hidden state. We show that
Transformers can nevertheless successfully perform in-context prediction on
unseen sequences from diverse PCG variants, in tasks that are beyond published
classical attacks. In our experiments we scale moduli up to $2^{22}$ using up
to $50$ million model parameters and datasets with up to $5$ billion tokens.
Surprisingly, we find even when the output is truncated to a single bit, it can
be reliably predicted by the model. When multiple distinct PRNGs are presented
together during training, the model can jointly learn them, identifying
structures from different permutations. We demonstrate a scaling law with
modulus $m$: the number of in-context sequence elements required for
near-perfect prediction grows as $\sqrt{m}$. For larger moduli, optimization
enters extended stagnation phases; in our experiments, learning moduli $m \geq
2^{20}$ requires incorporating training data from smaller moduli, demonstrating
a critical necessity for curriculum learning. Finally, we analyze embedding
layers and uncover a novel clustering phenomenon: the model spontaneously
groups the integer inputs into bitwise rotationally-invariant clusters,
revealing how representations can transfer from smaller to larger moduli.

Conclusion: VDSP为忆阻突触提供了一种高效的无监督局部学习方法，在多种忆阻器件上验证了其有效性，为边缘AI设备提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: The deployment of AI on edge computing devices faces significant challenges
related to energy consumption and functionality. These devices could greatly
benefit from brain-inspired learning mechanisms, allowing for real-time
adaptation while using low-power. In-memory computing with nanoscale resistive
memories may play a crucial role in enabling the execution of AI workloads on
these edge devices. In this study, we introduce voltage-dependent synaptic
plasticity (VDSP) as an efficient approach for unsupervised and local learning
in memristive synapses based on Hebbian principles. This method enables online
learning without requiring complex pulse-shaping circuits typically necessary
for spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). We show how VDSP can be
advantageously adapted to three types of memristive devices (TiO$_2$,
HfO$_2$-based metal-oxide filamentary synapses, and HfZrO$_4$-based
ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJ)) with disctinctive switching
characteristics. System-level simulations of spiking neural networks
incorporating these devices were conducted to validate unsupervised learning on
MNIST-based pattern recognition tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
The results demonstrated over 83% accuracy across all devices using 200
neurons. Additionally, we assessed the impact of device variability, such as
switching thresholds and ratios between high and low resistance state levels,
and proposed mitigation strategies to enhance robustness.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用神经混沌学习（NL）算法进行森林火灾分类，该算法基于混沌理论，受大脑启发，能够在少量数据下学习非线性模式，在低样本训练机制下表现优于传统机器学习和深度学习模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 森林火灾是危险且不可预测的自然灾害，现有机器学习和深度学习模型在分类准确率上不足，且需要大量训练数据。这些模型无法充分捕捉自然界的非线性特征，因此需要一种能够在少量数据下有效学习非线性模式的新方法。

Method: 采用神经混沌学习（NL）算法，这是一种基于混沌、受大脑启发的学习算法。使用一维混沌映射（广义Lüroth系列）作为神经元，特别是随机异质神经混沌学习（RHNL）变体，通过随机分布不同混沌神经元来模拟人脑的随机性和异质性。

Result: RHNL在阿尔及利亚森林火灾数据集上获得最佳F1分数1.0，在加拿大森林火灾数据集上获得0.90的高精度分数，在葡萄牙森林火灾数据集上获得0.68的精度分数。神经混沌学习架构在低样本训练机制下表现优于传统机器学习分类器。

Conclusion: 神经混沌学习（NL）架构相比传统机器学习分类器具有更好的性能，特别是在数据稀缺情况下，显示出开发更高效可靠森林火灾检测系统的潜力。该算法具有可解释性，能够保留数据中的因果结构。

Abstract: Forest fires are among the most dangerous and unpredictable natural disasters
worldwide. Forest fire can be instigated by natural causes or by humans. They
are devastating overall, and thus, many research efforts have been carried out
to predict whether a fire can occur in an area given certain environmental
variables. Many research works employ Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning
(DL) models for classification; however, their accuracy is merely adequate and
falls short of expectations. This limit arises because these models are unable
to depict the underlying nonlinearity in nature and extensively rely on
substantial training data, which is hard to obtain. We propose using Neurochaos
Learning (NL), a chaos-based, brain-inspired learning algorithm for forest fire
classification. Like our brains, NL needs less data to learn nonlinear patterns
in the training data. It employs one-dimensional chaotic maps, namely the
Generalized L\"uroth Series (GLS), as neurons. NL yields comparable performance
with ML and DL models, sometimes even surpassing them, particularly in
low-sample training regimes, and unlike deep neural networks, NL is
interpretable as it preserves causal structures in the data. Random
Heterogenous Neurochaos Learning (RHNL), a type of NL where different chaotic
neurons are randomnly located to mimic the randomness and heterogeneity of
human brain gives the best F1 score of 1.0 for the Algerian Forest Fires
Dataset. Compared to other traditional ML classifiers considered, RHNL also
gives high precision score of 0.90 for Canadian Forest Fires Dataset and 0.68
for Portugal Forest Fires Dataset. The results obtained from this work indicate
that Neurochaos Learning (NL) architectures achieve better performance than
conventional machine learning classifiers, highlighting their promise for
developing more efficient and reliable forest fire detection systems.

Motivation: 传统硅基或光基计算无法实现人工神经网络的并行分布式计算，限制了神经网络在超大规模实时问题中的应用

Method: 利用具有板载处理和无线通信功能的无线传感器网络节点，构建大规模并行分布式硬件平台来实现ANN算法

Result: 实现了数百上千个处理节点的大规模并行分布式计算，能够实时解决超大规模复杂问题

Conclusion: 这种实现方法将彻底改变计算方式，使实时解决超大规模科学、工程和技术问题成为可能

Abstract: We are proposing fully parallel and maximally distributed hardware
realization of a generic neuro-computing system. More specifically, the
proposal relates to the wireless sensor networks technology to serve as a
massively parallel and fully distributed hardware platform to implement and
realize artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms. A parallel and distributed
(PDP) hardware realization of ANNs makes it possible to have real time
computation of large-scale (and complex) problems in a highly robust framework.
We will demonstrate how a network of hundreds of thousands of processing nodes
(or motes of a wireless sensor network), which have on-board processing and
wireless communication features, can be used to implement fully parallel and
massively distributed computation of artificial neural network algorithms for
solution of truly large-scale problems in real time. The realization of
artificial neural network algorithms in a massively parallel and fully
distributed hardware has been the goal of neural network computing researchers.
This is because a parallel and distributed computation of artificial neural
network algorithms could not have been achieved against all the advancements in
silicon- or optics-based computing. Accordingly, artificial neural networks
could not be applied to very large-scale problems for real time computation of
solutions. This hindered the development of neural algorithms for affordable
and practical solutions of challenging problems since often special-purpose
computing approaches in hardware, software or hybrid (non-neural) had to be
developed for and fine-tuned to specific problems that are very large-scale and
highly complex. Successful implementation is likely to revolutionize computing
as we know it by making it possible to solve very large scale scientific,
engineering or technical problems in real time.

Motivation: 研究在非合作、不完全信息和公共监控下的分散决策问题，旨在通过效用设计实现社会最优，避免复杂的消息传递或完整机制设计。

Method: 通过效用塑造（嵌入影子价格或KKT对齐惩罚）使博弈成为精确势博弈；使用阻尼梯度和带滞后的最优响应更新；发布单一公共指数；适应离散和连续动作集。

Result: 相比仅使用价格的方法，效用塑造实现了接近集中化的福利，消除可行情况下的稳态约束/容量违反，加速收敛；离散均衡在网格内跟踪连续均衡。

Conclusion: 效用塑造加公共指数可在噪声和漂移下实现约束社会最优和稳定均衡，为运筹学提供了一种轻量级替代方案，适用于需求响应、云计算调度、交通定价和生物安全等领域。

Abstract: In this paper, we study decentralized decision-making where agents optimize
private objectives under incomplete information and imperfect public
monitoring, in a non-cooperative setting. By shaping utilities-embedding shadow
prices or Karush-Kuhn-Tucker(KKT)-aligned penalties-we make the stage game an
exact-potential game whose unique equilibrium equals the (possibly constrained)
social optimum. We characterize the Bayesian equilibrium as a stochastic
variational inequality; strong monotonicity follows from a single-inflection
compressed/stretched-exponential response combined with convex pricing. We give
tracking bounds for damped-gradient and best-response-with-hysteresis updates
under a noisy public index, and corresponding steady-state error. The framework
accommodates discrete and continuous action sets and composes with slower
discrete assignment. Deployable rules include: embed prices/penalties; publish
a single public index; tune steps, damping, and dual rates for contraction.
Computational experiments cover (i) a multi-tier supply chain and (ii) a
non-cooperative agentic-AI compute market of bidding bots. Relative to
price-only baselines, utility shaping attains near-centralized welfare,
eliminates steady-state constraint/capacity violations when feasible, and
accelerates convergence; with quantization, discrete equilibria track
continuous ones within the mesh. The blueprint is portable to demand response,
cloud/edge scheduling, and transportation pricing and biosecurity/agriculture.
Overall, utility shaping plus a public index implements the constrained social
optimum with stable equilibria under noise and drift-an
operations-research-friendly alternative to heavy messaging or full mechanism
design.
