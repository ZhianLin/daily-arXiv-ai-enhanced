### [1] [Label Smoothing++: Enhanced Label Regularization for Training Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05307)
*Sachin Chhabra,Hemanth Venkateswara,Baoxin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Label Smoothing++方法，通过为非目标类分配非零概率并考虑类间关系，改进传统标签平滑技术，缓解过拟合和过度自信问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标签平滑虽然能提高泛化能力，但为所有非目标类分配相同概率，破坏了类间关系，需要更智能的标签正则化策略。

Method: Label Smoothing++方法保持目标类标签固定，同时让网络学习非目标类的标签，考虑类间关系进行正则化。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效缓解过度自信预测，同时促进类间关系和泛化能力。

Conclusion: Label Smoothing++通过考虑类间关系改进了标签平滑技术，在保持正则化效果的同时更好地保留了类别间的语义关联。

Abstract: Training neural networks with one-hot target labels often results in
overconfidence and overfitting. Label smoothing addresses this issue by
perturbing the one-hot target labels by adding a uniform probability vector to
create a regularized label. Although label smoothing improves the network's
generalization ability, it assigns equal importance to all the non-target
classes, which destroys the inter-class relationships. In this paper, we
propose a novel label regularization training strategy called Label
Smoothing++, which assigns non-zero probabilities to non-target classes and
accounts for their inter-class relationships. Our approach uses a fixed label
for the target class while enabling the network to learn the labels associated
with non-target classes. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we
demonstrate how Label Smoothing++ mitigates overconfident predictions while
promoting inter-class relationships and generalization capabilities.

### [2] [Approximating Condorcet Ordering for Vector-valued Mathematical Morphology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06577)
*Marcos Eduardo Valle,Santiago Velasco-Forero,Joao Batista Florindo,Gustavo Jesus Angulo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于机器学习的方法来学习近似Condorcet排序的约简排序，用于构建彩色图像的向量值形态学算子


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数学形态学在向量值图像（如彩色和高光谱图像）处理中缺乏统一的向量排序方法，需要找到最合适的排序方式来构建形态学算子

Method: 采用机器学习方法学习一个约简排序来近似Condorcet排序，Condorcet排序通过多个不同排序的投票机制来对元素进行排序

Result: 初步计算实验证实了学习约简映射在定义彩色图像向量值形态学算子方面的有效性

Conclusion: 该方法为解决向量值图像数学形态学处理中的排序问题提供了有效的机器学习解决方案

Abstract: Mathematical morphology provides a nonlinear framework for image and spatial
data processing and analysis. Although there have been many successful
applications of mathematical morphology to vector-valued images, such as color
and hyperspectral images, there is still no consensus on the most suitable
vector ordering for constructing morphological operators. This paper addresses
this issue by examining a reduced ordering approximating the Condorcet ranking
derived from a set of vector orderings. Inspired by voting problems, the
Condorcet ordering ranks elements from most to least voted, with voters
representing different orderings. In this paper, we develop a machine learning
approach that learns a reduced ordering that approximates the Condorcet
ordering. Preliminary computational experiments confirm the effectiveness of
learning the reduced mapping to define vector-valued morphological operators
for color images.

### [3] [VILOD: A Visual Interactive Labeling Tool for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05317)
*Isac Holm*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VILOD是一个可视化交互标注工具，通过t-SNE投影、不确定性热图和模型状态视图，使目标检测中的人机协同标注工作流程更加透明和高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标检测深度学习需要大量准确标注数据，但标注过程耗时昂贵。主动学习虽然能减少标注工作量，但缺乏透明度且可能忽略重要样本。

Method: 开发VILOD工具，整合t-SNE图像特征投影、不确定性热图和模型状态视图，支持用户探索数据、解释模型状态和实现多样化样本选择策略。

Result: 实证研究表明VILOD使模型状态和数据集特征更易解释，不同可视化引导标注策略能达到与自动化不确定性采样基准相当的检测性能。

Conclusion: VILOD为目标检测的人机协同主动学习工作流程提供了更透明、可管理且可能更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The advancement of Object Detection (OD) using Deep Learning (DL) is often
hindered by the significant challenge of acquiring large, accurately labeled
datasets, a process that is time-consuming and expensive. While techniques like
Active Learning (AL) can reduce annotation effort by intelligently querying
informative samples, they often lack transparency, limit the strategic insight
of human experts, and may overlook informative samples not aligned with an
employed query strategy. To mitigate these issues, Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
approaches integrating human intelligence and intuition throughout the machine
learning life-cycle have gained traction. Leveraging Visual Analytics (VA),
effective interfaces can be created to facilitate this human-AI collaboration.
This thesis explores the intersection of these fields by developing and
investigating "VILOD: A Visual Interactive Labeling tool for Object Detection".
VILOD utilizes components such as a t-SNE projection of image features,
together with uncertainty heatmaps and model state views. Enabling users to
explore data, interpret model states, AL suggestions, and implement diverse
sample selection strategies within an iterative HITL workflow for OD. An
empirical investigation using comparative use cases demonstrated how VILOD,
through its interactive visualizations, facilitates the implementation of
distinct labeling strategies by making the model's state and dataset
characteristics more interpretable (RQ1). The study showed that different
visually-guided labeling strategies employed within VILOD result in competitive
OD performance trajectories compared to an automated uncertainty sampling AL
baseline (RQ2). This work contributes a novel tool and empirical insight into
making the HITL-AL workflow for OD annotation more transparent, manageable, and
potentially more effective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统体育性能测量技术质昂贵、复杂且无法普及到业余运动员的问题，为美潮球运动员提供可达的性能分析工具

Method: 采用自定义训练的YOLOv5模型进行凭毛球检测，结合卡尔曼筛波实现稳健轨迹跟踪，通过视频基于动力学的速度估算方法进行时空缩放

Result: 开发出一套成本效益高、使用方便的系统，能够从标准视频录制中自动计算凭毛球速度

Abstract: Performance metrics in sports, such as shot speed and angle, provide crucial
feedback for athlete development. However, the technology to capture these
metrics has historically been expensive, complex, and largely inaccessible to
amateur and recreational players. This paper addresses this gap in the context
of badminton, one of the world's most popular sports, by introducing a novel,
cost-effective, and user-friendly system for measuring smash speed using
ubiquitous smartphone technology. Our approach leverages a custom-trained
YOLOv5 model for shuttlecock detection, combined with a Kalman filter for
robust trajectory tracking. By implementing a video-based kinematic speed
estimation method with spatiotemporal scaling, the system automatically
calculates the shuttlecock's velocity from a standard video recording. The
entire process is packaged into an intuitive mobile application, democratizing
access to high-level performance analytics and empowering players at all levels
to analyze and improve their game.

### [5] [Context-Aware Knowledge Distillation with Adaptive Weighting for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05319)
*Zhengda Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出自适应知识蒸馏(AKD)框架，通过动态调整硬标签和软标签损失的平衡因子alpha，使用学生-教师差异指导的公式和上下文感知模块(CAM)来提升蒸馏效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏使用固定的alpha超参数来平衡硬标签和软标签损失，但静态alpha不是最优的，因为硬软监督的最佳权衡在训练过程中会变化。

Method: 1) 将alpha作为可学习参数；2) 基于学生-教师差异设计动态计算alpha的公式；3) 引入MLP+Attention的上下文感知模块(CAM)自适应重加权类别级教师输出。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，ResNet-50教师和ResNet-18学生的实验表明，该方法相比固定权重KD基线获得更高准确率，且收敛更稳定。

Conclusion: 自适应知识蒸馏框架通过动态调整损失权重和上下文感知的重加权机制，有效提升了知识蒸馏的性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely used technique to transfer knowledge
from a large teacher network to a smaller student model. Traditional KD uses a
fixed balancing factor alpha as a hyperparameter to combine the hard-label
cross-entropy loss with the soft-label distillation loss. However, a static
alpha is suboptimal because the optimal trade-off between hard and soft
supervision can vary during training.
  In this work, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Distillation (AKD) framework.
First we try to make alpha as learnable parameter that can be automatically
learned and optimized during training. Then we introduce a formula to reflect
the gap between the student and the teacher to compute alpha dynamically,
guided by student-teacher discrepancies, and further introduce a Context-Aware
Module (CAM) using MLP + Attention to adaptively reweight class-wise teacher
outputs. Experiments on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-50 as teacher and ResNet-18 as
student demonstrate that our approach achieves superior accuracy compared to
fixed-weight KD baselines, and yields more stable convergence.

*Pavithra Elumalai,Sudharsan Vijayaraghavan,Madhumita Mondal,Areejit Samal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究比较了三种边中心网络度量（FRC、ORC、EBC）在随机有线神经网络剪枝中的效果，发现计算效率更高的FRC能达到与ORC相当的剪枝性能，同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索网络拓扑结构对深度学习性能的影响，寻找计算效率更高的网络剪枝方法，在保持模型性能的同时降低网络复杂度。

Method: 使用三种边中心网络度量（Forman-Ricci曲率、Ollivier-Ricci曲率、边介数中心性）对三种随机网络生成器（ER、WS、BA模型）生成的RWNN进行选择性剪枝，应用于COVID-19胸部X光图像分类任务。

Result: FRC基于剪枝能有效简化RWNN，在保持与ORC相当性能的同时提供显著的计算优势，压缩后的网络在模块化和全局效率之间展现出权衡关系。

Conclusion: 计算效率更高的FRC可以作为ORC的有效替代方案进行网络剪枝，为深度学习模型的压缩和优化提供了新的有效工具。

Abstract: Randomly Wired Neural Networks (RWNNs) serve as a valuable testbed for
investigating the impact of network topology in deep learning by capturing how
different connectivity patterns impact both learning efficiency and model
performance. At the same time, they provide a natural framework for exploring
edge-centric network measures as tools for pruning and optimization. In this
study, we investigate three edge-centric network measures: Forman-Ricci
curvature (FRC), Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC), and edge betweenness
centrality (EBC), to compress RWNNs by selectively retaining important synapses
(or edges) while pruning the rest. As a baseline, RWNNs are trained for
COVID-19 chest x-ray image classification, aiming to reduce network complexity
while preserving performance in terms of accuracy, specificity, and
sensitivity. We extend prior work on pruning RWNN using ORC by incorporating
two additional edge-centric measures, FRC and EBC, across three network
generators: Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) model, Watts-Strogatz (WS) model, and
Barab\'{a}si-Albert (BA) model. We provide a comparative analysis of the
pruning performance of the three measures in terms of compression ratio and
theoretical speedup. A central focus of our study is to evaluate whether FRC,
which is computationally more efficient than ORC, can achieve comparable
pruning effectiveness. Along with performance evaluation, we further
investigate the structural properties of the pruned networks through modularity
and global efficiency, offering insights into the trade-off between modular
segregation and network efficiency in compressed RWNNs. Our results provide
initial evidence that FRC-based pruning can effectively simplify RWNNs,
offering significant computational advantages while maintaining performance
comparable to ORC.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of Optical Music Recognition (OMR)
for handwritten jazz lead sheets, a widely used musical score type that encodes
melody and chords. The task is challenging due to the presence of chords, a
score component not handled by existing OMR systems, and the high variability
and quality issues associated with handwritten images. Our contribution is
two-fold. We present a novel dataset consisting of 293 handwritten jazz lead
sheets of 163 unique pieces, amounting to 2021 total staves aligned with
Humdrum **kern and MusicXML ground truth scores. We also supply synthetic score
images generated from the ground truth. The second contribution is the
development of an OMR model for jazz lead sheets. We discuss specific
tokenisation choices related to our kind of data, and the advantages of using
synthetic scores and pretrained models. We publicly release all code, data, and
models.

### [9] [RT-VLM: Re-Thinking Vision Language Model with 4-Clues for Real-World Object Recognition Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05333)
*Junghyun Park,Tuan Anh Nguyen,Dugki Min*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RT-VLM框架通过合成数据集生成和两阶段重新思考机制，有效提升目标识别模型在域偏移场景下的鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界部署中，目标识别模型经常面临域偏移问题，包括图像统计特征变化、物体姿态变化、部分遮挡和类别混淆等，导致准确率严重下降

Method: 构建合成数据集生成管道生成包含4个线索（精确边界框、类别名称、详细物体级描述和场景级描述）的图像标注；对Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct进行参数高效监督调优；在推理时执行两阶段重新思考机制：首先生成四个线索，然后将其作为证据进行迭代修正

Result: 在隔离单个域偏移的鲁棒性基准测试中，RT-VLM持续超越强基线模型

Conclusion: 结构化多模态证据与显式自批判循环的结合是实现可靠和可迁移视觉理解的有前景途径

Abstract: Real world deployments often expose modern object recognition models to
domain shifts that precipitate a severe drop in accuracy. Such shifts encompass
(i) variations in low level image statistics, (ii) changes in object pose and
viewpoint, (iii) partial occlusion, and (iv) visual confusion across adjacent
classes. To mitigate this degradation, we introduce the Re-Thinking Vision
Language Model (RT-VLM) framework. The foundation of this framework is a unique
synthetic dataset generation pipeline that produces images annotated with
"4-Clues": precise bounding boxes, class names, detailed object-level captions,
and a comprehensive context-level caption for the entire scene. We then perform
parameter efficient supervised tuning of Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct on this
resource. At inference time, a two stage Re-Thinking scheme is executed: the
model first emits its own four clues, then re examines these responses as
evidence and iteratively corrects them. Across robustness benchmarks that
isolate individual domain shifts, RT-VLM consistently surpasses strong
baselines. These findings indicate that the integration of structured
multimodal evidence with an explicit self critique loop constitutes a promising
route toward reliable and transferable visual understanding.

*Zebo Xu,Shaoyun Yu,Mark Torrance,Guido Nottbusch,Nan Zhao,Zhenguang Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 中文手写数据库和工具箱的建立，揭示了语音、语义和字形等语言因素在字符、部首和笔画层面对手写过程的层级刻衰影响


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决中文手写研究中语言组件影响机制不清和缺乏细粒度数据捐捕工具的问题

Method: 建立大规模手写数据库（42人手写1200字符），升级OpenHandWrite_Toolbox工具箱，通过多元回归分析字符、部首和笔画层面的语言影响

Result: 字形因素在手写准备和执行各层面都有显著影响，语音因素在执行阶段各层面也有影响，且影响力逐层减弱（字符层>部首层>笔画层）

Conclusion: 手写准备和执行在部首和笔画层面与语言组件密切相关，数据库和工具箱为语言学手写研究提供了价值资源

Abstract: Understanding what linguistic components (e.g., phonological, semantic, and
orthographic systems) modulate Chinese handwriting at the character, radical,
and stroke levels remains an important yet understudied topic. Additionally,
there is a lack of comprehensive tools for capturing and batch-processing
fine-grained handwriting data. To address these issues, we constructed a
large-scale handwriting database in which 42 Chinese speakers for each
handwriting 1200 characters in a handwriting-to-dictation task. Additionally,
we enhanced the existing handwriting package and provided comprehensive
documentation for the upgraded OpenHandWrite_Toolbox, which can easily modify
the experimental design, capture the stroke-level handwriting trajectory, and
batch-process handwriting measurements (e.g., latency, duration, and
pen-pressure). In analysing our large-scale database, multiple regression
results show that orthographic predictors impact handwriting preparation and
execution across character, radical, and stroke levels. Phonological factors
also influence execution at all three levels. Importantly, these lexical
effects demonstrate hierarchical attenuation - they were most pronounced at the
character level, followed by the radical, and were weakest at the stroke
levels. These findings demonstrate that handwriting preparation and execution
at the radical and stroke levels are closely intertwined with linguistic
components. This database and toolbox offer valuable resources for future
psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic research on the handwriting of characters
and sub-characters across different languages.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合动态图神经网络和LSTM的混合模型，用于预测跌倒事件，通过解耦运动预测和步态分类任务实现高精度早期跌倒检测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注跌倒检测，但跌倒发生前的预测以及稳定状态与即将跌倒之间的瞬态状态分析尚未得到充分探索

Method: 使用混合模型（DGNN+LSTM），DGNN作为分类器区分三种步态状态（稳定、瞬态、跌倒），LSTM网络预测后续时间步的人类运动

Result: 在OUMVLP-Pose和URFD数据集上验证，相比仅使用DGNN的模型和文献中的模型，在预测误差和识别准确率方面表现出优越性能

Conclusion: 解耦预测和分类任务比使用单一DGNN解决统一问题性能更好，该方法能够监测瞬态状态，为高级辅助系统提供有价值的信息

Abstract: Detecting and preventing falls in humans is a critical component of assistive
robotic systems. While significant progress has been made in detecting falls,
the prediction of falls before they happen, and analysis of the transient state
between stability and an impending fall remain unexplored. In this paper, we
propose a anticipatory fall detection method that utilizes a hybrid model
combining Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNN) with Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks that decoupled the motion prediction and gait classification
tasks to anticipate falls with high accuracy. Our approach employs real-time
skeletal features extracted from video sequences as input for the proposed
model. The DGNN acts as a classifier, distinguishing between three gait states:
stable, transient, and fall. The LSTM-based network then predicts human
movement in subsequent time steps, enabling early detection of falls. The
proposed model was trained and validated using the OUMVLP-Pose and URFD
datasets, demonstrating superior performance in terms of prediction error and
recognition accuracy compared to models relying solely on DGNN and models from
literature. The results indicate that decoupling prediction and classification
improves performance compared to addressing the unified problem using only the
DGNN. Furthermore, our method allows for the monitoring of the transient state,
offering valuable insights that could enhance the functionality of advanced
assistance systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Segmentation of brain tumors from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains a
pivotal challenge in medical image analysis due to the heterogeneous nature of
tumor morphology and intensity distributions. Accurate delineation of tumor
boundaries is critical for clinical decision-making, radiotherapy planning, and
longitudinal disease monitoring. In this study, we perform a comprehensive
comparative analysis of two major clustering paradigms applied in MRI tumor
segmentation: hard clustering, exemplified by the K-Means algorithm, and soft
clustering, represented by Fuzzy C-Means (FCM). While K-Means assigns each
pixel strictly to a single cluster, FCM introduces partial memberships, meaning
each pixel can belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of association.
Experimental validation was performed using the BraTS2020 dataset,
incorporating pre-processing through Gaussian filtering and Contrast Limited
Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). Evaluation metrics included the Dice
Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and processing time, which collectively
demonstrated that K-Means achieved superior speed with an average runtime of
0.3s per image, whereas FCM attained higher segmentation accuracy with an
average DSC of 0.67 compared to 0.43 for K-Means, albeit at a higher
computational cost (1.3s per image). These results highlight the inherent
trade-off between computational efficiency and boundary precision.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Event cameras provide sparse yet temporally high-temporal-resolution motion
information, demonstrating great potential for motion deblurring. Existing
methods focus on cross-modal interaction, overlooking the inherent
incompleteness of event streams, which arises from the trade-off between
sensitivity and noise introduced by the thresholding mechanism of Dynamic
Vision Sensors (DVS). Such degradation compromises the integrity of motion
priors and limits the effectiveness of event-guided deblurring. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a Robust Event-guided Deblurring (RED) network with
modality-specific disentangled representation. First, we introduce a
Robustness-Oriented Perturbation Strategy (RPS) that applies random masking to
events, which exposes RED to incomplete patterns and then foster robustness
against various unknown scenario conditions.Next, a disentangled OmniAttention
is presented to explicitly model intra-motion, inter-motion, and cross-modality
correlations from two inherently distinct but complementary sources: blurry
images and partially disrupted events. Building on these reliable features, two
interactive modules are designed to enhance motion-sensitive areas in blurry
images and inject semantic context into incomplete event representations.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate RED
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
robustness.

Result: 在真实田间图像数据集上达到96.90%的总体准确率和0.96的F1分数，效果超过其他方法

Conclusion: 该模型能够有效地进行多类别葵花疾病和害虫分类，为精准农业提供了实用的解决方案

Abstract: Accurate classification of pests and diseases plays a vital role in precision
agriculture, enabling efficient identification, targeted interventions, and
preventing their further spread. However, current methods primarily focus on
binary classification, which limits their practical applications, especially in
scenarios where accurately identifying the specific type of disease or pest is
essential. We propose a robust deep learning based model for multi-class
classification of onion crop diseases and pests. We enhance a pre-trained
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model by integrating attention based modules
and employing comprehensive data augmentation pipeline to mitigate class
imbalance. We propose a model which gives 96.90% overall accuracy and 0.96 F1
score on real-world field image dataset. This model gives better results than
other approaches using the same datasets.

TL;DR: DVRF是一种基于蒸馏的无反演文本到图像编辑框架，通过显式建模源和目标速度场差异来减少过平滑伪影，并引入时间相关偏移项来增强目标分布对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决先前蒸馏采样方法中普遍存在的过平滑伪影问题，提供更高质量的文本到图像编辑效果。

Method: 提出Delta Velocity Rectified Flow (DVRF)框架，通过显式建模源-目标速度场差异和使用时间相关偏移项来优化目标轨迹对齐。

Result: 实验结果表明DVRF在编辑质量、保真度和可控性方面表现优异，且无需架构修改，具有高效性和广泛适用性。

Conclusion: DVRF成功将基于分数的扩散优化和基于速度的整流流优化联系起来，为FlowEdit等方法提供了理论解释，实现了高质量的文本到图像编辑。

Abstract: We propose Delta Velocity Rectified Flow (DVRF), a novel inversion-free,
path-aware editing framework within rectified flow models for text-to-image
editing. DVRF is a distillation-based method that explicitly models the
discrepancy between the source and target velocity fields in order to mitigate
over-smoothing artifacts rampant in prior distillation sampling approaches. We
further introduce a time-dependent shift term to push noisy latents closer to
the target trajectory, enhancing the alignment with the target distribution. We
theoretically demonstrate that when this shift is disabled, DVRF reduces to
Delta Denoising Score, thereby bridging score-based diffusion optimization and
velocity-based rectified-flow optimization. Moreover, when the shift term
follows a linear schedule under rectified-flow dynamics, DVRF generalizes the
Inversion-free method FlowEdit and provides a principled theoretical
interpretation for it. Experimental results indicate that DVRF achieves
superior editing quality, fidelity, and controllability while requiring no
architectural modifications, making it efficient and broadly applicable to
text-to-image editing tasks. Code is available at

Abstract: Deep learning has become a powerful tool for medical image analysis; however,
conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) often fail to capture the
fine-grained and complex features critical for accurate diagnosis. To address
this limitation, we systematically integrate attention mechanisms into five
widely adopted CNN architectures, namely, VGG16, ResNet18, InceptionV3,
DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB5, to enhance their ability to focus on salient
regions and improve discriminative performance. Specifically, each baseline
model is augmented with either a Squeeze and Excitation block or a hybrid
Convolutional Block Attention Module, allowing adaptive recalibration of
channel and spatial feature representations. The proposed models are evaluated
on two distinct medical imaging datasets, a brain tumor MRI dataset comprising
multiple tumor subtypes, and a Products of Conception histopathological dataset
containing four tissue categories. Experimental results demonstrate that
attention augmented CNNs consistently outperform baseline architectures across
all metrics. In particular, EfficientNetB5 with hybrid attention achieves the
highest overall performance, delivering substantial gains on both datasets.
Beyond improved classification accuracy, attention mechanisms enhance feature
localization, leading to better generalization across heterogeneous imaging
modalities. This work contributes a systematic comparative framework for
embedding attention modules in diverse CNN architectures and rigorously
assesses their impact across multiple medical imaging tasks. The findings
provide practical insights for the development of robust, interpretable, and
clinically applicable deep learning based decision support systems.

Abstract: Instance segmentation is essential for numerous computer vision applications,
including robotics, human-computer interaction, and autonomous driving.
Currently, popular models bring impressive performance in instance segmentation
by training with a large number of human annotations, which are costly to
collect. For this reason, we present a new framework that efficiently and
effectively segments objects without the need for human annotations. Firstly, a
MultiCut algorithm is applied to self-supervised features for coarse mask
segmentation. Then, a mask filter is employed to obtain high-quality coarse
masks. To train the segmentation network, we compute a novel superpixel-guided
mask loss, comprising hard loss and soft loss, with high-quality coarse masks
and superpixels segmented from low-level image features. Lastly, a
self-training process with a new adaptive loss is proposed to improve the
quality of predicted masks. We conduct experiments on public datasets in
instance segmentation and object detection to demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework. The results show that the proposed framework
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Cell biomechanics involve a great number of complex phenomena that are
fundamental to the evolution of life itself and other associated processes,
ranging from the very early stages of embryo-genesis to the maintenance of
damaged structures or the growth of tumors. Given the importance of such
phenomena, increasing research has been dedicated to their understanding, but
the many interactions between them and their influence on the decisions of
cells as a collective network or cluster remain unclear. We present a new
approach that combines Structure Preserving Neural Networks, which study cell
movements as a purely mechanical system, with other Machine Learning tools
(Artificial Neural Networks), which allow taking into consideration
environmental factors that can be directly deduced from an experiment with
Computer Vision techniques. This new model, tested on simulated and real cell
migration cases, predicts complete cell trajectories following a roll-out
policy with a high level of accuracy. This work also includes a mitosis event
prediction model based on Neural Networks architectures which makes use of the
same observed features.

Abstract: Latent generative models have shown remarkable progress in high-fidelity
image synthesis, typically using a two-stage training process that involves
compressing images into latent embeddings via learned tokenizers in the first
stage. The quality of generation strongly depends on how expressive and
well-optimized these latent embeddings are. While various methods have been
proposed to learn effective latent representations, the reconstructed images
often lack realism, particularly in textured regions with sharp transitions,
due to loss of fine details governed by high frequencies. We conduct a detailed
frequency decomposition of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) latent tokenizers
and show that conventional objectives inherently prioritize low-frequency
reconstruction, often at the expense of high-frequency fidelity. Our analysis
reveals these latent tokenizers exhibit a bias toward low-frequency
information, when jointly optimized, leading to over-smoothed outputs and
visual artifacts that diminish perceptual quality. To address this, we propose
a wavelet-based, frequency-aware variational autoencoder (FA-VAE) framework
that explicitly decouples the optimization of low- and high-frequency
components. This decoupling enables improved reconstruction of fine textures
while preserving global structure. Our approach bridges the fidelity gap in
current latent tokenizers and emphasizes the importance of frequency-aware
optimization for realistic image representation, with broader implications for
applications in content creation, neural rendering, and medical imaging.

Abstract: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have achieved state of the art performance
across various computer vision tasks, however their practical deployment is
limited by computational and memory overhead. This paper introduces
Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning, a novel single shot filter pruning
framework that focuses on evaluating the stability and redundancy of filter
importance scores across multiple criteria. Differential Sensitivity Fusion
Pruning computes a differential sensitivity score for each filter by fusing the
discrepancies among gradient based sensitivity, first order Taylor expansion,
and KL divergence of activation distributions. An exponential scaling mechanism
is applied to emphasize filters with inconsistent importance across metrics,
identifying candidates that are structurally unstable or less critical to the
model performance. Unlike iterative or reinforcement learning based pruning
strategies, Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning is efficient and
deterministic, requiring only a single forward-backward pass for scoring and
pruning. Extensive experiments across varying pruning rates between 50 to 70
percent demonstrate that Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning significantly
reduces model complexity, achieving over 80 percent Floating point Operations
Per Seconds reduction while maintaining high accuracy. For instance, at 70
percent pruning, our approach retains up to 98.23 percent of baseline accuracy,
surpassing traditional heuristics in both compression and generalization. The
proposed method presents an effective solution for scalable and adaptive Deep
Convolutional Neural Networks compression, paving the way for efficient
deployment on edge and mobile platforms.

Motivation: 实时物体检测YOLO架构在资源受限环境（如无人机）中部署需要高效转移学习，但层冻结策略对当代YOLOv8/YOLOv10的具体影响仍未明确

Method: 系统研究多种冻结配置，使用4个关键基础设施监控数据集，结合梯度行为分析（L2范数）和可视化解释（Grad-CAM）来揭示训练动态

Result: 发现没有通用最佳冻结策略，而是依赖于数据特性：冻结背骨网络有效保留通用特征，浅层冻结更适合处理极端类别不平衡。节省较多GPU内存使用，mAP@50在某些情况下超过全量微调

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了实证发现和实用指南，为资源有限场景下的物体检测转移学习提供基于证据的平衡方法

Abstract: The You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture is crucial for real-time object
detection. However, deploying it in resource-constrained environments such as
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) requires efficient transfer learning. Although
layer freezing is a common technique, the specific impact of various freezing
configurations on contemporary YOLOv8 and YOLOv10 architectures remains
unexplored, particularly with regard to the interplay between freezing depth,
dataset characteristics, and training dynamics. This research addresses this
gap by presenting a detailed analysis of layer-freezing strategies. We
systematically investigate multiple freezing configurations across YOLOv8 and
YOLOv10 variants using four challenging datasets that represent critical
infrastructure monitoring. Our methodology integrates a gradient behavior
analysis (L2 norm) and visual explanations (Grad-CAM) to provide deeper
insights into training dynamics under different freezing strategies. Our
results reveal that there is no universal optimal freezing strategy but,
rather, one that depends on the properties of the data. For example, freezing
the backbone is effective for preserving general-purpose features, while a
shallower freeze is better suited to handling extreme class imbalance. These
configurations reduce graphics processing unit (GPU) memory consumption by up
to 28% compared to full fine-tuning and, in some cases, achieve mean average
precision (mAP@50) scores that surpass those of full fine-tuning. Gradient
analysis corroborates these findings, showing distinct convergence patterns for
moderately frozen models. Ultimately, this work provides empirical findings and
practical guidelines for selecting freezing strategies. It offers a practical,
evidence-based approach to balanced transfer learning for object detection in
scenarios with limited resources.

Conclusion: QUAN框架在资源受限的机器人系统中具有部署潜力，适用于需要旋转感知的其他应用领域。

Abstract: This paper introduces Quaternion Approximate Networks (QUAN), a novel deep
learning framework that leverages quaternion algebra for rotation equivariant
image classification and object detection. Unlike conventional quaternion
neural networks attempting to operate entirely in the quaternion domain, QUAN
approximates quaternion convolution through Hamilton product decomposition
using real-valued operations. This approach preserves geometric properties
while enabling efficient implementation with custom CUDA kernels. We introduce
Independent Quaternion Batch Normalization (IQBN) for training stability and
extend quaternion operations to spatial attention mechanisms. QUAN is evaluated
on image classification (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet), object detection (COCO,
DOTA), and robotic perception tasks. In classification tasks, QUAN achieves
higher accuracy with fewer parameters and faster convergence compared to
existing convolution and quaternion-based models. For objection detection, QUAN
demonstrates improved parameter efficiency and rotation handling over standard
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while establishing the SOTA for quaternion
CNNs in this downstream task. These results highlight its potential for
deployment in resource-constrained robotic systems requiring rotation-aware
perception and application in other domains.

Abstract: Recently, distilling open-vocabulary language features from 2D images into 3D
Gaussians has attracted significant attention. Although existing methods
achieve impressive language-based interactions of 3D scenes, we observe two
fundamental issues: background Gaussians contributing negligibly to a rendered
pixel get the same feature as the dominant foreground ones, and multi-view
inconsistencies due to view-specific noise in language embeddings. We introduce
Visibility-Aware Language Aggregation (VALA), a lightweight yet effective
method that computes marginal contributions for each ray and applies a
visibility-aware gate to retain only visible Gaussians. Moreover, we propose a
streaming weighted geometric median in cosine space to merge noisy multi-view
features. Our method yields a robust, view-consistent language feature
embedding in a fast and memory-efficient manner. VALA improves open-vocabulary
localization and segmentation across reference datasets, consistently
surpassing existing works.

Abstract: In this paper, a contrastive representation learning framework is proposed to
enhance human action segmentation via pre-training using trimmed (single
action) skeleton sequences. Unlike previous representation learning works that
are tailored for action recognition and that build upon isolated sequence-wise
representations, the proposed framework focuses on exploiting multi-scale
representations in conjunction with cross-sequence variations. More
specifically, it proposes a novel data augmentation strategy, 'Shuffle and
Warp', which exploits diverse multi-action permutations. The latter effectively
assists two surrogate tasks that are introduced in contrastive learning: Cross
Permutation Contrasting (CPC) and Relative Order Reasoning (ROR). In
optimization, CPC learns intra-class similarities by contrasting
representations of the same action class across different permutations, while
ROR reasons about inter-class contexts by predicting relative mapping between
two permutations. Together, these tasks enable a Dual-Surrogate Contrastive
Learning (DuoCLR) network to learn multi-scale feature representations
optimized for action segmentation. In experiments, DuoCLR is pre-trained on a
trimmed skeleton dataset and evaluated on an untrimmed dataset where it
demonstrates a significant boost over state-the-art comparatives in both
multi-class and multi-label action segmentation tasks. Lastly, ablation studies
are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of each component of the proposed
approach.

Abstract: Model quantization reduces neural network parameter precision to achieve
compression, but often compromises accuracy. Existing post-training
quantization (PTQ) methods employ iterative parameter updates to preserve
accuracy under high compression ratios, incurring significant computational
complexity and resource overhead, which limits applicability in
resource-constrained edge computing and real-time inference scenarios. This
paper proposes an efficient PTQ method guided by parameter sensitivity
analysis. The approach prioritizes quantization of high-sensitivity parameters,
leveraging unquantized low-sensitivity parameters to compensate for
quantization errors, thereby mitigating accuracy degradation. Furthermore, by
exploiting column-wise clustering of parameter sensitivity, the method
introduces a row-parallel quantization framework with a globally shared inverse
Hessian matrix update mechanism, reducing computational complexity by an order
of magnitude. Experimental results on ResNet-50 and YOLOv5s demonstrate a
20-200-fold quantization speedup over the Optimal Brain Quantization baseline,
with mean accuracy loss below 0.3%, confirming the method's efficacy in
balancing efficiency and accuracy.

Motivation: 解决仅需单张照片输入即可生成可控制虚拟人物的问题，并实现高效率驱动和高质量渲染

Method: 采用两阶段训练方案，基于WebSSL构建大规模一图生成器，通过分离设计实现重建与驱动的解耦

Result: 在512x512分辨率下达到90 FPS渲染速度，高频细节纹理重建能力显著提升，性能超越当前最先进方法

Conclusion: 该分离框架遵循缩放定律，通过扩大模型规模可进一步提升性能，而驱动效率不受影响，为单图虚拟人物生成提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: In this paper, we explore a reconstruction and reenactment separated
framework for 3D Gaussians head, which requires only a single portrait image as
input to generate controllable avatar. Specifically, we developed a large-scale
one-shot gaussian head generator built upon WebSSL and employed a two-stage
training approach that significantly enhances the capabilities of
generalization and high-frequency texture reconstruction. During inference, an
ultra-lightweight gaussian avatar driven by control signals enables high
frame-rate rendering, achieving 90 FPS at a resolution of 512x512. We further
demonstrate that the proposed framework follows the scaling law, whereby
increasing the parameter scale of the reconstruction module leads to improved
performance. Moreover, thanks to the separation design, driving efficiency
remains unaffected. Finally, extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
validate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成内容(AIGC)技术快速发展导致人脸伪造威胁社会安全，但现有Deepfake检测方法受限于数据集缺乏真实场景的多样性，特别是在未知伪造技术、面部场景变化、真实数据丰富度和现实传播退化等方面存在不足。

Result: 基准评估显示MFFI在场景复杂性、跨域泛化能力和检测难度梯度方面优于现有公共数据集，验证了其在模拟真实世界条件方面的技术先进性和实用性。

Conclusion: MFFI数据集通过多维度增强策略有效解决了现有Deepfake检测数据集的局限性，为真实场景下的人脸伪造检测提供了更全面和实用的基准数据集。

Abstract: Rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) have
enabled increasingly sophisticated face forgeries, posing a significant threat
to social security. However, current Deepfake detection methods are limited by
constraints in existing datasets, which lack the diversity necessary in
real-world scenarios. Specifically, these data sets fall short in four key
areas: unknown of advanced forgery techniques, variability of facial scenes,
richness of real data, and degradation of real-world propagation. To address
these challenges, we propose the Multi-dimensional Face Forgery Image
(\textbf{MFFI}) dataset, tailored for real-world scenarios. MFFI enhances
realism based on four strategic dimensions: 1) Wider Forgery Methods; 2) Varied
Facial Scenes; 3) Diversified Authentic Data; 4) Multi-level Degradation
Operations. MFFI integrates $50$ different forgery methods and contains $1024K$
image samples. Benchmark evaluations show that MFFI outperforms existing public
datasets in terms of scene complexity, cross-domain generalization capability,
and detection difficulty gradients. These results validate the technical
advance and practical utility of MFFI in simulating real-world conditions. The
dataset and additional details are publicly available at

TL;DR: VideoGraph：一种基于语言引导的时空图建模方法，通过递归图网络处理视频摘要任务，将对象和帧分别建模为空间和时间图节点，结合语言查询实现语义关系建模，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频摘要方法主要关注帧间的全局时序关系，但忽略了细粒度视觉实体（如对象）与视频主要内容的高度相关性。同时，语言引导的视频摘要需要对复杂真实世界视频有全面的语言理解能力。

Method: 提出递归时空图网络VideoGraph，将对象和帧分别作为空间图和时间图的节点，通过图边连接表示节点间的语义关系。为避免仅基于视觉相似性配置边，将视频衍生的语言查询融入图节点表示，使其包含语义知识。采用递归策略精化初始图并正确分类关键帧。

Result: 在多个通用和查询聚焦视频摘要基准测试中，VideoGraph在监督和无监督设置下均达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 将视频摘要视为语言引导的时空图建模问题是有效的，VideoGraph通过结合视觉对象和语言语义信息，能够更好地理解视频内容并生成高质量的摘要。

Abstract: Video summarization aims to select keyframes that are visually diverse and
can represent the whole story of a given video. Previous approaches have
focused on global interlinkability between frames in a video by temporal
modeling. However, fine-grained visual entities, such as objects, are also
highly related to the main content of the video. Moreover, language-guided
video summarization, which has recently been studied, requires a comprehensive
linguistic understanding of complex real-world videos. To consider how all the
objects are semantically related to each other, this paper regards video
summarization as a language-guided spatiotemporal graph modeling problem. We
present recursive spatiotemporal graph networks, called VideoGraph, which
formulate the objects and frames as nodes of the spatial and temporal graphs,
respectively. The nodes in each graph are connected and aggregated with graph
edges, representing the semantic relationships between the nodes. To prevent
the edges from being configured with visual similarity, we incorporate language
queries derived from the video into the graph node representations, enabling
them to contain semantic knowledge. In addition, we adopt a recursive strategy
to refine initial graphs and correctly classify each frame node as a keyframe.
In our experiments, VideoGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance on several
benchmarks for generic and query-focused video summarization in both supervised
and unsupervised manners. The code is available at

Method: 提出PaKA对齐目标，通过对齐教师和学生模型的密集特征分布来抓取统计依赖关系，并研究专门为密集表征学习设计的增强策略

Result: 在多个密集视觉指标上达到最先进水平

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效将现有语义知识转移到密集特征空间，为密集预测任务提供优秀的表征学习方案

Abstract: Dense representations are essential for vision tasks that require spatial
precision and fine-grained detail. While most self-supervised representation
learning methods focus on global representations that summarize the image as a
whole, such approaches often fall short in capturing the localized semantics
necessary for dense prediction tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose
a framework that builds on pretrained representations through additional
self-supervised learning, aiming to transfer existing semantic knowledge into
the dense feature space. Our method aligns the distributions of dense features
between a teacher and a student model. Specifically, we introduce Patch-level
Kernel Alignment (PaKA), a simple yet effective alignment objective that
captures statistical dependencies, thereby matching the structural
relationships of dense patches across the two models. In addition, we
investigate augmentation strategies specifically designed for dense
representation learning. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results across
a variety of dense vision benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
approach.

TL;DR: SpecPrune-VLA是一种无需训练的双层剪枝方法，利用局部和全局信息进行智能token选择，在保持成功率的同时实现显著加速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型剪枝方法仅使用当前动作的局部信息，忽略了历史动作的全局上下文，导致成功率下降超过20%且加速效果有限

Method: 提出静态剪枝（动作级别使用全局历史和局部上下文减少视觉token）和动态剪枝（层级基于层重要性剪枝token），并配备轻量级动作感知控制器根据动作粒度调整剪枝强度

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，相比OpenVLA-OFT，在NVIDIA A800上实现1.46倍加速，在NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090上实现1.57倍加速，且成功率损失可忽略不计

Conclusion: 结合局部和全局信息的智能剪枝策略能有效提升VLA模型的推理速度，同时保持性能，为计算密集型模型的优化提供了有效方案

Abstract: Pruning accelerates compute-bound models by reducing computation. Recently
applied to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, existing methods prune tokens
using only local info from current action, ignoring global context from prior
actions, causing >20% success rate drop and limited speedup. We observe high
similarity across consecutive actions and propose leveraging both local
(current) and global (past) info for smarter token selection. We introduce
SpecPrune-VLA, a training-free method with two-level pruning and heuristic
control: (1) Static pruning at action level: uses global history and local
context to reduce visual tokens per action; (2) Dynamic pruning at layer level:
prunes tokens per layer based on layer-specific importance; (3) Lightweight
action-aware controller: classifies actions as coarse/fine-grained (by speed),
adjusting pruning aggressiveness since fine-grained actions are
pruning-sensitive. Experiments on LIBERO show SpecPrune-VLA achieves 1.46 times
speedup on NVIDIA A800 and 1.57 times on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 vs.
OpenVLA-OFT, with negligible success rate loss.

*Kien Nguyen,Anh Tran,Cuong Pham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Subspace Mapping (SuMa)方法，专门用于有效擦除文本到图像扩散模型中的狭窄概念（如版权角色、名人），在保持图像质量的同时实现鲁棒的概念移除。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念擦除方法无法同时满足鲁棒性和有效性，特别是对于狭窄概念（如版权内容、名人）的擦除存在挑战，这些概念与非目标概念距离相近，需要更精细的操作。

Method: SuMa首先推导表示要擦除概念的目标子空间，然后通过将其映射到最小化距离的参考子空间来进行中和，确保目标概念被鲁棒擦除的同时保持图像质量。

Result: 在四个任务（子类擦除、名人擦除、艺术风格擦除和实例擦除）上的实验表明，SuMa在图像质量上可与专注于有效性的方法相媲美，同时在完整性方面与专门方法相当。

Conclusion: SuMa方法成功解决了狭窄概念擦除的挑战，实现了鲁棒性和有效性的平衡，为处理版权和法律问题提供了有效的技术解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-image diffusion models has raised concerns about
their potential misuse in generating harmful or unauthorized contents. To
address these issues, several Concept Erasure methods have been proposed.
However, most of them fail to achieve both robustness, i.e., the ability to
robustly remove the target concept., and effectiveness, i.e., maintaining image
quality. While few recent techniques successfully achieve these goals for NSFW
concepts, none could handle narrow concepts such as copyrighted characters or
celebrities. Erasing these narrow concepts is critical in addressing copyright
and legal concerns. However, erasing them is challenging due to their close
distances to non-target neighboring concepts, requiring finer-grained
manipulation. In this paper, we introduce Subspace Mapping (SuMa), a novel
method specifically designed to achieve both robustness and effectiveness in
easing these narrow concepts. SuMa first derives a target subspace representing
the concept to be erased and then neutralizes it by mapping it to a reference
subspace that minimizes the distance between the two. This mapping ensures the
target concept is robustly erased while preserving image quality. We conduct
extensive experiments with SuMa across four tasks: subclass erasure, celebrity
erasure, artistic style erasure, and instance erasure and compare the results
with current state-of-the-art methods. Our method achieves image quality
comparable to approaches focused on effectiveness, while also yielding results
that are on par with methods targeting completeness.

Motivation: 虽然多谱和RGB影像在精确农业中应用广泛，但超谱图像在标签有限或无标签情况下的分析仍面临挑战，需要开发有效的自盛督学习方法来提取有意义的植被物性信息。

Method: 采用自盛督学习方法，通过神经网络学习从空中超谱图像中生成反映植被物性的嵌入表示空间，并构建树木的表征表示。

Result: 实验结果显示，使用植被物性相关嵌入空间构建的树木表征表示，在下游机器学习任务中的表现覆盖了直接使用超谱植被属性的方法。

Conclusion: 通过自盛督学习构建的植被物性相关嵌入表示空间，能够从超谱图像中有效提取树木的表征信息，为精确农业应用提供更优种的数据表示方法。

Abstract: Aerial remote sensing using multispectral and RGB imagers has provided a
critical impetus to precision agriculture. Analysis of the hyperspectral images
with limited or no labels is challenging. This paper focuses on self-supervised
learning to create neural network embeddings reflecting vegetation properties
of trees from aerial hyperspectral images of crop fields. Experimental results
demonstrate that a constructed tree representation, using a vegetation
property-related embedding space, performs better in downstream machine
learning tasks compared to the direct use of hyperspectral vegetation
properties as tree representations.

Result: YOLOv11x突出（63.7% mAP@0.5），但速度慢（45.8ms）；YOLOv8m和YOLOv11m性能速度平衡；少见车辆类别检测准确度极低，视觉相似车辆容易歧误分类

Conclusion: 研究为孜加拙交通环境特定的对象检测系统开发奠定基础，解决传统通用模型在发展中地区性能不足问题，需要关注数据均衡性和少见类别识别挑战

Abstract: Vehicle detection systems trained on Non-Bangladeshi datasets struggle to
accurately identify local vehicle types in Bangladesh's unique road
environments, creating critical gaps in autonomous driving technology for
developing regions. This study evaluates six YOLO model variants on a custom
dataset featuring 29 distinct vehicle classes, including region-specific
vehicles such as ``Desi Nosimon'', ``Leguna'', ``Battery Rickshaw'', and
``CNG''. The dataset comprises high-resolution images (1920x1080) captured
across various Bangladeshi roads using mobile phone cameras and manually
annotated using LabelImg with YOLO format bounding boxes. Performance
evaluation revealed YOLOv11x as the top performer, achieving 63.7\% mAP@0.5,
43.8\% mAP@0.5:0.95, 61.4\% recall, and 61.6\% F1-score, though requiring 45.8
milliseconds per image for inference. Medium variants (YOLOv8m, YOLOv11m)
struck an optimal balance, delivering robust detection performance with mAP@0.5
values of 62.5\% and 61.8\% respectively, while maintaining moderate inference
times around 14-15 milliseconds. The study identified significant detection
challenges for rare vehicle classes, with Construction Vehicles and Desi
Nosimons showing near-zero accuracy due to dataset imbalances and insufficient
training samples. Confusion matrices revealed frequent misclassifications
between visually similar vehicles, particularly Mini Trucks versus Mini Covered
Vans. This research provides a foundation for developing robust object
detection systems specifically adapted to Bangladesh traffic conditions,
addressing critical needs in autonomous vehicle technology advancement for
developing regions where conventional generic-trained models fail to perform
adequately.

Motivation: 现有角色编辑方法在简单提示下表现良好，但在面对包含多层语义、时间逻辑和复杂上下文关系的长文本叙事时，往往出现编辑能力下降、语义理解偏差和身份一致性崩溃的问题。

Method: 通过PerceiverAttention的精细分解、引入ID损失和与扩散模型的联合动态训练，以及集成模块的离线融合策略，在最小数据润滑下实现深度多层级语义编辑。

Result: 在复杂叙事环境中保持身份一致性的同时实现高质量图像生成，在IBench评估中取得优异结果。

Conclusion: EditIDv2成功解决了长文本叙事场景下的角色编辑挑战，为高复杂度叙事内容的高质量图像生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose EditIDv2, a tuning-free solution specifically designed for
high-complexity narrative scenes and long text inputs. Existing character
editing methods perform well under simple prompts, but often suffer from
degraded editing capabilities, semantic understanding biases, and identity
consistency breakdowns when faced with long text narratives containing multiple
semantic layers, temporal logic, and complex contextual relationships. In
EditID, we analyzed the impact of the ID integration module on editability. In
EditIDv2, we further explore and address the influence of the ID feature
integration module. The core of EditIDv2 is to discuss the issue of editability
injection under minimal data lubrication. Through a sophisticated decomposition
of PerceiverAttention, the introduction of ID loss and joint dynamic training
with the diffusion model, as well as an offline fusion strategy for the
integration module, we achieve deep, multi-level semantic editing while
maintaining identity consistency in complex narrative environments using only a
small amount of data lubrication. This meets the demands of long prompts and
high-quality image generation, and achieves excellent results in the IBench
evaluation.

Motivation: 现有场景图预测方法主要依赖视觉线索，难以有效整合常识知识，限制了长期预测的鲁棒性

Method: 将场景图预测任务解耦为两步：先用场景图捕捉模型将视频转换为场景图序列，再用纯文本模型预测未来场景图。提出对象导向两阶段方法(OOTSM)，LLM先预测对象出现消失，再生成详细人-物关系

Conclusion: 提出的语言场景图预测方法有效整合了常识知识，显著提升了长期预测性能，在场景图预测任务中达到最先进水平

Abstract: A scene graph is a structured represention of objects and their relationships
in a scene. Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) involves predicting future scene
graphs from video clips, enabling applications as intelligent surveillance and
human-machine collaboration. Existing SGA approaches primarily leverage visual
cues, often struggling to integrate valuable commonsense knowledge, thereby
limiting long-term prediction robustness. To explicitly leverage such
commonsense knowledge, we propose a new approach to better understand the
objects, concepts, and relationships in a scene graph. Our approach decouples
the SGA task in two steps: first a scene graph capturing model is used to
convert a video clip into a sequence of scene graphs, then a pure text-based
model is used to predict scene graphs in future frames. Our focus in this work
is on the second step, and we call it Linguistic Scene Graph Anticipation
(LSGA) and believes it should have independent interest beyond the use in SGA
discussed here. For LSGA, we introduce an Object-Oriented Two-Staged Method
(OOTSM) where an Large Language Model (LLM) first forecasts object appearances
and disappearances before generating detailed human-object relations. We
conduct extensive experiments to evaluate OOTSM in two settings. For LSGA, we
evaluate our fine-tuned open-sourced LLMs against zero-shot APIs (i.e., GPT-4o,
GPT-4o-mini, and DeepSeek-V3) on a benchmark constructed from Action Genome
annotations. For SGA, we combine our OOTSM with STTran++ from, and our
experiments demonstrate effective state-of-the-art performance: short-term
mean-Recall (@10) increases by 3.4% while long-term mean-Recall (@50) improves
dramatically by 21.9%. Code is available at https://github.com/ZhuXMMM/OOTSM.

Motivation: 受高能粒子物理中堆积器测量的启发，想要将物理引导的前知如守恒性、局域性和隔离性等原则嵌入神经网络结构，以提高图像去噪在强污某条件下的稳健性。

Method: 提出了一个受堆积器启发的去噪器层次结构：包括带守恒约束的清差CNN、其高斯噪声变体，以及WIPUNet（结合这些思想的UNet基础结构）。

Conclusion: 这是一个概念验证，证明物理启发的归纳偏置可以在不依赖复杂SOTA模型的情况下，为图像去噪提供在高噪声条件下的稳健性改善。

Abstract: In high-energy particle physics, collider measurements are contaminated by
"pileup", overlapping soft interactions that obscure the hard-scatter signal of
interest. Dedicated subtraction strategies exploit physical priors such as
conservation, locality, and isolation. Inspired by this analogy, we investigate
how such principles can inform image denoising by embedding physics-guided
inductive biases into neural architectures. This paper is a proof of concept:
rather than targeting state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks, we ask whether
physics-inspired priors improve robustness under strong corruption.
  We introduce a hierarchy of PU-inspired denoisers: a residual CNN with
conservation constraints, its Gaussian-noise variants, and the Weighted
Inductive Pileup-physics-inspired U-Network for Denoising (WIPUNet), which
integrates these ideas into a UNet backbone. On CIFAR-10 with Gaussian noise at
$\sigma\in\{15,25,50,75,100\}$, PU-inspired CNNs are competitive with standard
baselines, while WIPUNet shows a \emph{widening margin} at higher noise.
Complementary BSD500 experiments show the same trend, suggesting
physics-inspired priors provide stability where purely data-driven models
degrade. Our contributions are: (i) translating pileup-mitigation principles
into modular inductive biases; (ii) integrating them into UNet; and (iii)
demonstrating robustness gains at high noise without relying on heavy SOTA
machinery.

TL;DR: CAMVR框架通过视觉-文本上下文记忆单元和自适应视觉聚焦机制，解决了多轮视觉对话中的上下文丢失和幻觉问题，在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>

Motivation: 当前大语言模型和视觉语言大模型在单轮任务表现出色，但在需要深度上下文理解和复杂视觉推理的多轮交互中存在推理碎片化、上下文丢失和幻觉等挑战。

Method: 提出CAMVR框架，包含两个关键创新：1）视觉-文本上下文记忆单元(VCMU) - 动态读写记忆网络，存储管理每轮交互的视觉特征、文本语义表示及其跨模态对应关系；2）自适应视觉聚焦指导(AVFG)机制 - 利用VCMU上下文动态调整视觉编码器对相关图像区域的注意力。

Result: 在VisDial、改进版A-OKVQA和新型多轮指令跟随(MTIF)数据集上的广泛实验表明，CAMVR持续实现最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CAMVR框架通过创新的记忆管理和注意力机制，有效提升了多轮视觉-文本推理的连贯性和准确性，为解决多轮视觉对话中的核心挑战提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs)
excel in single-turn tasks but face significant challenges in multi-turn
interactions requiring deep contextual understanding and complex visual
reasoning, often leading to fragmented reasoning, context loss, and
hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose Context-Aware
Multi-Turn Visual Reasoning (CAMVR), a novel framework designed to empower
LVLMs with robust and coherent multi-turn visual-textual inference
capabilities. CAMVR introduces two key innovations: a Visual-Textual Context
Memory Unit (VCMU), a dynamic read-write memory network that stores and manages
critical visual features, textual semantic representations, and their
cross-modal correspondences from each interaction turn; and an Adaptive Visual
Focus Guidance (AVFG) mechanism, which leverages the VCMU's context to
dynamically adjust the visual encoder's attention to contextually relevant
image regions. Our multi-level reasoning integration strategy ensures that
response generation is deeply coherent with both current inputs and accumulated
historical context. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets, including
VisDial, an adapted A-OKVQA, and our novel Multi-Turn Instruction Following
(MTIF) dataset, demonstrate that CAMVR consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Conclusion: MeshMetrics作为一个开源Python包发布，为图像分割评估提供了更可靠的指标实现方案。

Abstract: The surge of research in image segmentation has yielded remarkable
performance gains but also exposed a reproducibility crisis. A major
contributor is performance evaluation, where both selection and implementation
of metrics play critical roles. While recent efforts have improved the former,
the reliability of metric implementation has received far less attention.
Pitfalls in distance-based metric implementation can lead to considerable
discrepancies between common open-source tools, for instance, exceeding 100 mm
for the Hausdorff distance and 30%pt for the normalized surface distance for
the same pair of segmentations. To address these pitfalls, we introduce
MeshMetrics, a mesh-based framework that provides a more precise computation of
distance-based metrics than conventional grid-based approaches. Through
theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that MeshMetrics
achieves higher accuracy and precision than established tools, and is
substantially less affected by discretization artifacts, such as distance
quantization. We release MeshMetrics as an open-source Python package,
available at https://github.com/gasperpodobnik/MeshMetrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LVLM-VAR是一个基于预训练视觉-语言大模型的视频动作识别框架，通过视频到语义标记转换和LoRA微调，在NTU数据集上达到SOTA性能并提升可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在深度语义理解、复杂上下文信息和细粒度区分方面存在局限，需要利用大语言模型的强大能力来解决视频动作识别中的这些挑战

Method: 提出Video-to-Semantic-Tokens模块将原始视频转换为离散的语义动作标记，结合自然语言指令，通过LoRA微调的LVLM（如LLaVA-13B）进行分类和语义推理

Result: 在NTU RGB+D和NTU RGB+D 120等挑战性基准上达到最先进或极具竞争力的性能（NTU RGB+D X-Sub 94.1%，NTU RGB+D 120 X-Set 90.0%）

Conclusion: LVLM-VAR不仅显著提升了动作识别准确率，还通过生成自然语言解释大大增强了模型的可解释性，为视频理解任务开辟了新方向

Abstract: Human action recognition often struggles with deep semantic understanding,
complex contextual information, and fine-grained distinction, limitations that
traditional methods frequently encounter when dealing with diverse video data.
Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of large language models, this paper
introduces LVLM-VAR, a novel framework that pioneers the application of
pre-trained Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) to video action recognition,
emphasizing enhanced accuracy and interpretability. Our method features a
Video-to-Semantic-Tokens (VST) Module, which innovatively transforms raw video
sequences into discrete, semantically and temporally consistent "semantic
action tokens," effectively crafting an "action narrative" that is
comprehensible to an LVLM. These tokens, combined with natural language
instructions, are then processed by a LoRA-fine-tuned LVLM (e.g., LLaVA-13B)
for robust action classification and semantic reasoning. LVLM-VAR not only
achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance on challenging
benchmarks such as NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120, demonstrating significant
improvements (e.g., 94.1% on NTU RGB+D X-Sub and 90.0% on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Set),
but also substantially boosts model interpretability by generating natural
language explanations for its predictions.

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖RGB图像的语义特征，忽略了空间结构信息在捕获视角不变特征中的重要性，无法有效处理无人机图像与地面图像间的剧烈视角差异

Method: 使用双分支特征提取框架，结合差异感知融合模块(DAFM)和联合约束交互聚合(JCIA)策略，深度融合语义和结构信息；提出3D地理增强技术生成视角变化样本

Result: 在University-1652和SUES-200数据集上的大量实验验证了方法对复杂视角变化的鲁棒性，实现了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 通过整合RGB和法线图像的几何结构信息，能够有效学习视角不变特征，显著提升跨视角地理定位的准确性和鲁棒性

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization plays a critical role in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
(UAV) localization and navigation. However, significant challenges arise from
the drastic viewpoint differences and appearance variations between images.
Existing methods predominantly rely on semantic features from RGB images, often
neglecting the importance of spatial structural information in capturing
viewpoint-invariant features. To address this issue, we incorporate geometric
structural information from normal images and introduce a Joint perception
network to integrate RGB and Normal images (JRN-Geo). Our approach utilizes a
dual-branch feature extraction framework, leveraging a Difference-Aware Fusion
Module (DAFM) and Joint-Constrained Interaction Aggregation (JCIA) strategy to
enable deep fusion and joint-constrained semantic and structural information
representation. Furthermore, we propose a 3D geographic augmentation technique
to generate potential viewpoint variation samples, enhancing the network's
ability to learn viewpoint-invariant features. Extensive experiments on the
University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets validate the robustness of our method
against complex viewpoint ariations, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: LiDAR-BIND-T扩展了多模态融合框架，通过时间一致性机制增强雷达/声纳到LiDAR的转换，在SLAM中实现更好的时空一致性和性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态传感器融合中的时间不一致问题，提升下游SLAM任务的鲁棒性和性能

Method: 引入三种时间一致性机制：时间嵌入相似性对齐、运动对齐变换损失、窗口时间融合模块，并更新模型架构以保持空间结构

Result: 在雷达/声纳到LiDAR转换中展示了改进的时空一致性，降低了绝对轨迹误差，提高了Cartographer SLAM中的占据地图精度

Conclusion: LiDAR-BIND-T保持了即插即用的多模态融合能力，同时显著增强了时间稳定性，为下游SLAM应用提供了更好的鲁棒性和性能

Abstract: This paper extends LiDAR-BIND, a modular multi-modal fusion framework that
binds heterogeneous sensors (radar, sonar) to a LiDAR-defined latent space,
with mechanisms that explicitly enforce temporal consistency. We introduce
three contributions: (i) temporal embedding similarity that aligns consecutive
latents, (ii) a motion-aligned transformation loss that matches displacement
between predictions and ground truth LiDAR, and (iii) windows temporal fusion
using a specialised temporal module. We further update the model architecture
to better preserve spatial structure. Evaluations on radar/sonar-to-LiDAR
translation demonstrate improved temporal and spatial coherence, yielding lower
absolute trajectory error and better occupancy map accuracy in
Cartographer-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping). We propose
different metrics based on the Fr\'echet Video Motion Distance (FVMD) and a
correlation-peak distance metric providing practical temporal quality
indicators to evaluate SLAM performance. The proposed temporal LiDAR-BIND, or
LiDAR-BIND-T, maintains plug-and-play modality fusion while substantially
enhancing temporal stability, resulting in improved robustness and performance
for downstream SLAM.

Conclusion: Multi-LVI-SAM框架通过全景建模和外参补偿有效解决了多相机融合问题，显著提升了状态估计的准确性和鲁棒性

Abstract: We propose a multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial odometry framework,
Multi-LVI-SAM, which fuses data from multiple fisheye cameras, LiDAR and
inertial sensors for highly accurate and robust state estimation. To enable
efficient and consistent integration of visual information from multiple
fisheye cameras, we introduce a panoramic visual feature model that unifies
multi-camera observations into a single representation. The panoramic model
serves as a global geometric optimization framework that consolidates
multi-view constraints, enabling seamless loop closure and global pose
optimization, while simplifying system design by avoiding redundant handling of
individual cameras. To address the triangulation inconsistency caused by the
misalignment between each camera's frame and the panoramic model's frame, we
propose an extrinsic compensation method. This method improves feature
consistency across views and significantly reduces triangulation and
optimization errors, leading to more accurate pose estimation. We integrate the
panoramic visual feature model into a tightly coupled LiDAR-visual-inertial
system based on a factor graph. Extensive experiments on public datasets
demonstrate that the panoramic visual feature model enhances the quality and
consistency of multi-camera constraints, resulting in higher accuracy and
robustness than existing multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于理论基础的距离适配性超分辨框架，通过模型化空间变化的退化过程和深度条件卷积核，解决了传统方法在实际景观中距离依赖性退化问题，在多个数据集上达到了最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单图超分辨方法假设空间不变的退化模型，但真实成像系统存在大气散射、景深变化、透视扩形等复杂的距离依赖效应，必须发展空间适配性重建策略来结合几何场景理解。

Method: 提出了一种严格的变分框架，将超分辨形式化为空间变化的逆问题，通过深度条件卷积核实现离散梯度流动力学，并包含了基于大气散射理论的谱约束和动态调整的学习正则化项。

Result: 在5个标准数据集上达到了最先进性能，在KITTI室外场景上获得2倍和4倍缩放的36.89/0.9516和30.54/0.8721 PSNR/SSIM指标，分别超过现有方法0.44dB和0.36dB。

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了第一个理论基础坚实的距离适配性超分辨框架，在深度变化场景中实现了显著改进，同时在传统标准数据集上保持了竞争力。

Abstract: Single image super-resolution traditionally assumes spatially-invariant
degradation models, yet real-world imaging systems exhibit complex
distance-dependent effects including atmospheric scattering, depth-of-field
variations, and perspective distortions. This fundamental limitation
necessitates spatially-adaptive reconstruction strategies that explicitly
incorporate geometric scene understanding for optimal performance. We propose a
rigorous variational framework that characterizes super-resolution as a
spatially-varying inverse problem, formulating the degradation operator as a
pseudodifferential operator with distance-dependent spectral characteristics
that enable theoretical analysis of reconstruction limits across depth ranges.
Our neural architecture implements discrete gradient flow dynamics through
cascaded residual blocks with depth-conditional convolution kernels, ensuring
convergence to stationary points of the theoretical energy functional while
incorporating learned distance-adaptive regularization terms that dynamically
adjust smoothness constraints based on local geometric structure. Spectral
constraints derived from atmospheric scattering theory prevent bandwidth
violations and noise amplification in far-field regions, while adaptive kernel
generation networks learn continuous mappings from depth to reconstruction
filters. Comprehensive evaluation across five benchmark datasets demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance, achieving 36.89/0.9516 and 30.54/0.8721 PSNR/SSIM
at 2 and 4 scales on KITTI outdoor scenes, outperforming existing methods by
0.44dB and 0.36dB respectively. This work establishes the first
theoretically-grounded distance-adaptive super-resolution framework and
demonstrates significant improvements on depth-variant scenarios while
maintaining competitive performance across traditional benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了InterAct数据集和基于扩散的方法，用于从语音输入同时生成两个人的交互式面部表情和身体动作，解决了长时动态交互行为捕捉的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作大多只关注单人动作或假设身体方向/位置不变的对话手势，无法准确捕捉日常场景中两人动态、语义一致的长时间交互行为。

Method: 采集了包含241个运动序列的多模态数据集InterAct，并提出分层回归身体动作的扩散方法，以及改进嘴唇准确性的微调机制。

Result: InterAct数据集包含丰富复杂的个体动作和长期交互模式，提出的方法能有效从语音生成交互式面部表情和身体动作。

Conclusion: 该工作为研究长时间动态交互行为提供了高质量数据集和有效方法，推动了多人交互行为建模的发展。

Abstract: We address the problem of accurate capture of interactive behaviors between
two people in daily scenarios. Most previous works either only consider one
person or solely focus on conversational gestures of two people, assuming the
body orientation and/or position of each actor are constant or barely change
over each interaction. In contrast, we propose to simultaneously model two
people's activities, and target objective-driven, dynamic, and semantically
consistent interactions which often span longer duration and cover bigger
space. To this end, we capture a new multi-modal dataset dubbed InterAct, which
is composed of 241 motion sequences where two people perform a realistic and
coherent scenario for one minute or longer over a complete interaction. For
each sequence, two actors are assigned different roles and emotion labels, and
collaborate to finish one task or conduct a common interaction activity. The
audios, body motions, and facial expressions of both persons are captured.
InterAct contains diverse and complex motions of individuals and interesting
and relatively long-term interaction patterns barely seen before. We also
demonstrate a simple yet effective diffusion-based method that estimates
interactive face expressions and body motions of two people from speech inputs.
Our method regresses the body motions in a hierarchical manner, and we also
propose a novel fine-tuning mechanism to improve the lip accuracy of facial
expressions. To facilitate further research, the data and code is made
available at https://hku-cg.github.io/interact/ .

TL;DR: AdCare-VLM是基于Video-LLaVA的多模态视觉语言模型，专门用于通过患者视频进行药物依从性视觉问答，在结核病药物监测任务上相比现有方法有3.1-3.54%的绝对提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 慢性疾病需要严格的药物依从性来防止疾病进展和管理症状，但患者行为、医疗成本高等因素经常影响依从性。需要开发能够通过视频分析自动监测药物依从性的系统。

Method: 使用806个临床专家标注的结核病药物监测视频数据集LLM-TB-VQA，基于Video-LLaVA框架进行微调，识别患者面部清晰度、药物可见性、饮水动作等视觉特征与医疗概念的关联。

Result: 在预训练、常规和LoRA配置下，AdCare-VLM相比LLaVA-V1.5和Chat-UniVi等PEFT-enabled VLM模型有3.1%到3.54%的绝对性能提升。消融研究和注意力图可视化验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: AdCare-VLM成功整合了对齐的视觉-语言表示，改善了多模态交互，为药物依从性监测提供了一种有效的视觉问答解决方案，具有很好的可解释性。

Abstract: Chronic diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, asthma, HIV-AIDS,
epilepsy, and tuberculosis, necessitate rigorous adherence to medication to
avert disease progression, manage symptoms, and decrease mortality rates.
Adherence is frequently undermined by factors including patient behavior,
caregiver support, elevated medical costs, and insufficient healthcare
infrastructure. We propose AdCare-VLM, a specialized Video-LLaVA-based
multimodal large vision language model (LVLM) aimed at visual question
answering (VQA) concerning medication adherence through patient videos. We
employ a private dataset comprising 806 custom-annotated tuberculosis (TB)
medication monitoring videos, which have been labeled by clinical experts, to
fine-tune the model for adherence pattern detection. We present LLM-TB-VQA, a
detailed medical adherence VQA dataset that encompasses positive, negative, and
ambiguous adherence cases. Our method identifies correlations between visual
features, such as the clear visibility of the patient's face, medication, water
intake, and the act of ingestion, and their associated medical concepts in
captions. This facilitates the integration of aligned visual-linguistic
representations and improves multimodal interactions. Experimental results
indicate that our method surpasses parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
enabled VLM models, such as LLaVA-V1.5 and Chat-UniVi, with absolute
improvements ranging from 3.1% to 3.54% across pre-trained, regular, and
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) configurations. Comprehensive ablation studies and
attention map visualizations substantiate our approach, enhancing
interpretability.

Conclusion: PARSE-VOS通过分层推理和LLM驱动的训练免费框架，有效解决了复杂语言描述下的视频对象分割问题，取得了优异性能。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment an object of
interest throughout a video based on a language description. The prominent
challenge lies in aligning static text with dynamic visual content,
particularly when objects exhibiting similar appearances with inconsistent
motion and poses. However, current methods often rely on a holistic
visual-language fusion that struggles with complex, compositional descriptions.
In this paper, we propose \textbf{PARSE-VOS}, a novel, training-free framework
powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), for a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine
reasoning across text and video domains. Our approach begins by parsing the
natural language query into structured semantic commands. Next, we introduce a
spatio-temporal grounding module that generates all candidate trajectories for
all potential target objects, guided by the parsed semantics. Finally, a
hierarchical identification module select the correct target through a
two-stage reasoning process: it first performs coarse-grained motion reasoning
with an LLM to narrow down candidates; if ambiguity remains, a fine-grained
pose verification stage is conditionally triggered to disambiguate. The final
output is an accurate segmentation mask for the target object.
\textbf{PARSE-VOS} achieved state-of-the-art performance on three major
benchmarks: Ref-YouTube-VOS, Ref-DAVIS17, and MeViS.

Abstract: Deciphering oracle bone characters (OBCs), the oldest attested form of
written Chinese, has remained the ultimate, unwavering goal of scholars,
offering an irreplaceable key to understanding humanity's early modes of
production. Current decipherment methodologies of OBC are primarily constrained
by the sporadic nature of archaeological excavations and the limited corpus of
inscriptions. With the powerful visual perception capability of large
multimodal models (LMMs), the potential of using LMMs for visually deciphering
OBCs has increased. In this paper, we introduce PictOBI-20k, a dataset designed
to evaluate LMMs on the visual decipherment tasks of pictographic OBCs. It
includes 20k meticulously collected OBC and real object images, forming over
15k multi-choice questions. We also conduct subjective annotations to
investigate the consistency of the reference point between humans and LMMs in
visual reasoning. Experiments indicate that general LMMs possess preliminary
visual decipherment skills, and LMMs are not effectively using visual
information, while most of the time they are limited by language priors. We
hope that our dataset can facilitate the evaluation and optimization of visual
attention in future OBC-oriented LMMs. The code and dataset will be available
at https://github.com/OBI-Future/PictOBI-20k.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效的姿态对齐方法，用于改进医学成像中部分形状重建的准确性，通过调整现有模型来匹配目标形状的姿态，无需原始训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学成像中，点分布模型常用于重建和补全部分形状，但训练数据和目标形状之间的姿态对齐差异会导致重建结果偏差，特别是对于小形状部分。现有方法往往忽视这一关键因素。

Method: 提出了一种高效的方法来调整现有统计模型以适应特定目标形状的姿态。该方法保持了线性模型的计算效率，通过简单的预处理步骤实现平移的精确对齐和旋转的良好近似，无需访问原始训练数据。

Result: 该方法显著提高了重建精度和预测方差，能够精确恢复平移对齐的模型，并为小旋转提供良好近似，使现有形状模型能够在即插即用场景中广泛适用。

Conclusion: 姿态对齐对部分形状重建至关重要，所提出的方法为现有重建管道提供了一种简单有效的预处理解决方案，显著提升了医学成像中形状重建的性能。

Abstract: In medical imaging, point distribution models are often used to reconstruct
and complete partial shapes using a statistical model of the full shape. A
commonly overlooked, but crucial factor in this reconstruction process, is the
pose of the training data relative to the partial target shape. A difference in
pose alignment of the training and target shape leads to biased solutions,
particularly when observing small parts of a shape. In this paper, we
demonstrate the importance of pose alignment for partial shape reconstructions
and propose an efficient method to adjust an existing model to a specific
target. Our method preserves the computational efficiency of linear models
while significantly improving reconstruction accuracy and predicted variance.
It exactly recovers the intended aligned model for translations, and provides a
good approximation for small rotations, all without access to the original
training data. Hence, existing shape models in reconstruction pipelines can be
adapted by a simple preprocessing step, making our approach widely applicable
in plug-and-play scenarios.

TL;DR: PointPillars是最快的3D物体检测器，但性能较差。这篇论文提出了第一个基于伪图像表示的两阶段3D检测框架，通过3DPillars CNN结构和稀疏场景特征模块来提升性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决PointPillars的两个主要限制：1)伪图像表示无法保留精确的3D结构；2)难以采用两阶段检测流程。目标是缩小PointPillars与最新方法的性能差距，同时保持其高效性。

Method: 提出两个新组件：1)3DPillars CNN结构，通过可分离氧粒特征模块使用2D卷积高效学习氧粒特征；2)RoI头部与稀疏场景上下文特征模块，聚合多尺度特征获得稀疏场景特征，支持两阶段检测。

Result: 在KITTI和Waymo Open数据集上进行实验，证明了方法的有效性和效率，在速度和准确性之间实现了良好的折衷。

Conclusion: 该框架成功充分利用了伪图像表示的高效性优势，同时克服了PointPillars的限制，为高效两阶段3D检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: PointPillars is the fastest 3D object detector that exploits pseudo image
representations to encode features for 3D objects in a scene. Albeit efficient,
PointPillars is typically outperformed by state-of-the-art 3D detection methods
due to the following limitations: 1) The pseudo image representations fail to
preserve precise 3D structures, and 2) they make it difficult to adopt a
two-stage detection pipeline using 3D object proposals that typically shows
better performance than a single-stage approach. We introduce in this paper the
first two-stage 3D detection framework exploiting pseudo image representations,
narrowing the performance gaps between PointPillars and state-of-the-art
methods, while retaining its efficiency. Our framework consists of two novel
components that overcome the aforementioned limitations of PointPillars: First,
we introduce a new CNN architecture, dubbed 3DPillars, that enables learning 3D
voxel-based features from the pseudo image representation efficiently using 2D
convolutions. The basic idea behind 3DPillars is that 3D features from voxels
can be viewed as a stack of pseudo images. To implement this idea, we propose a
separable voxel feature module that extracts voxel-based features without using
3D convolutions. Second, we introduce an RoI head with a sparse scene context
feature module that aggregates multi-scale features from 3DPillars to obtain a
sparse scene feature. This enables adopting a two-stage pipeline effectively,
and fully leveraging contextual information of a scene to refine 3D object
proposals. Experimental results on the KITTI and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, achieving a good
compromise in terms of speed and accuracy.

Conclusion: CRAB模型通过有效融合相机和雷达信息，成功解决了深度模糊问题，为BEV视角下的3D目标检测和分割提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Recently, camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection methods in bird's eye
view (BEV) have gained attention due to the complementary characteristics and
cost-effectiveness of these sensors. Previous approaches using forward
projection struggle with sparse BEV feature generation, while those employing
backward projection overlook depth ambiguity, leading to false positives. In
this paper, to address the aforementioned limitations, we propose a novel
camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection and segmentation model named CRAB
(Camera-Radar fusion for reducing depth Ambiguity in Backward projection-based
view transformation), using a backward projection that leverages radar to
mitigate depth ambiguity. During the view transformation, CRAB aggregates
perspective view image context features into BEV queries. It improves depth
distinction among queries along the same ray by combining the dense but
unreliable depth distribution from images with the sparse yet precise depth
information from radar occupancy. We further introduce spatial cross-attention
with a feature map containing radar context information to enhance the
comprehension of the 3D scene. When evaluated on the nuScenes open dataset, our
proposed approach achieves a state-of-the-art performance among backward
projection-based camera-radar fusion methods with 62.4\% NDS and 54.0\% mAP in
3D object detection.

*Julio Zanon Diaz,Georgios Siogkas,Peter Corcoran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了两种注意力引导的自编码器架构用于医疗设备制造中的深度异常检测，分别使用结构相似性评分和马氏距离方法，在小型不平衡数据集上实现高精度实时缺陷检测和监管合规监控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗设备制造中的视觉检测自动化面临小样本、不平衡数据、高分辨率图像和严格监管要求的挑战，需要开发能够在这些约束条件下工作的深度异常检测方法。

Method: 提出了两种注意力引导的自编码器架构：第一种使用基于结构相似性的异常评分（4-MS-SSIM）进行轻量级实时缺陷检测；第二种使用马氏距离对降维潜在特征进行评分，提供对分布偏移的高敏感性。

Result: 第一种方法在仅有10%缺陷样本的情况下达到ACC 0.903（无监督阈值）和0.931（有监督阈值）；第二种方法在有监督阈值下达到ACC 0.722。两种方法均优于重新实现的基线方法。

Conclusion: 这两种方法提供了互补能力：第一种支持可靠的在线检测，第二种支持可扩展的生产后监控和监管合规监测，为在受监管制造环境中部署深度异常检测提供了实用途径，符合欧盟AI法案对高风险AI系统的要求。

Abstract: Automating visual inspection in medical device manufacturing remains
challenging due to small and imbalanced datasets, high-resolution imagery, and
stringent regulatory requirements. This work proposes two attention-guided
autoencoder architectures for deep anomaly detection designed to address these
constraints. The first employs a structural similarity-based anomaly score
(4-MS-SSIM), offering lightweight and accurate real-time defect detection,
yielding ACC 0.903 (unsupervised thresholding) and 0.931 (supervised
thresholding) on the - Surface Seal Image - Test split with only 10% of
defective samples. The second applies a feature-distance approach using
Mahalanobis scoring on reduced latent features, providing high sensitivity to
distributional shifts for supervisory monitoring, achieving ACC 0.722 with
supervised thresholding. Together, these methods deliver complementary
capabilities: the first supports reliable inline inspection, while the second
enables scalable post-production surveillance and regulatory compliance
monitoring. Experimental results demonstrate that both approaches surpass
re-implemented baselines and provide a practical pathway for deploying deep
anomaly detection in regulated manufacturing environments, aligning accuracy,
efficiency, and the regulatory obligations defined for high-risk AI systems
under the EU AI Act.

### [57] [A Probabilistic Segment Anything Model for Ambiguity-Aware Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05809)
*Tyler Ward,Abdullah Imran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Probabilistic SAM是SAM的概率扩展版本，通过引入潜在变量空间和变分训练目标，能够生成反映人类标注变异性的多样化分割掩码，特别适用于医学图像中存在标注不确定性的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的可提示分割模型（如SAM）是确定性的，只能为每个提示生成单一分割结果，无法捕捉真实世界任务中固有的模糊性。这在医学成像中尤其成问题，因为标注不确定性或专家间差异可能导致多个合理分割结果。

Method: 在SAM框架中集成先验网络和后验网络，通过潜在变量空间调制提示嵌入，使用变分目标进行训练，学习生成多样且合理的分割掩码分布。

Result: 在LIDC-IDRI肺结节数据集上的评估显示，Probabilistic SAM能够产生与专家分歧一致的多样化输出，在不确定性感知指标上优于现有概率基线方法。

Conclusion: Probabilistic SAM成功扩展了SAM的概率能力，能够有效建模分割任务中的不确定性，为医学图像分析等需要处理标注变异性的领域提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in promptable segmentation, such as the Segment Anything
Model (SAM), have enabled flexible, high-quality mask generation across a wide
range of visual domains. However, SAM and similar models remain fundamentally
deterministic, producing a single segmentation per object per prompt, and fail
to capture the inherent ambiguity present in many real-world tasks. This
limitation is particularly troublesome in medical imaging, where multiple
plausible segmentations may exist due to annotation uncertainty or inter-expert
variability. In this paper, we introduce Probabilistic SAM, a probabilistic
extension of SAM that models a distribution over segmentations conditioned on
both the input image and prompt. By incorporating a latent variable space and
training with a variational objective, our model learns to generate diverse and
plausible segmentation masks reflecting the variability in human annotations.
The architecture integrates a prior and posterior network into the SAM
framework, allowing latent codes to modulate the prompt embeddings during
inference. The latent space allows for efficient sampling during inference,
enabling uncertainty-aware outputs with minimal overhead. We evaluate
Probabilistic SAM on the public LIDC-IDRI lung nodule dataset and demonstrate
its ability to produce diverse outputs that align with expert disagreement,
outperforming existing probabilistic baselines on uncertainty-aware metrics.

TL;DR: 基于MODIS卫星多谱图像的3D卷积网络实时沙尘检测系统，准确率达0.92，能够在全球范围提供及时沙尘警报


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 沙尘暴对健康和能见度造成害处，需要从卫星图像中快速检测沙尘

Method: 使用3D卷积网络学习NASA Terra和Aqua卫星MODIS仪器的36个波段图像，统计热红外波段分离沙尘与云层和表面特征，通过简单的标准化和本地填充处理缺失数据

Result: 在17个独立MODIS场景中，模型达到约0.92的准确率，均方误差为0.014，改进版本训练速度提高21倍，支持快速处理全景图像

Conclusion: 聚合波段和空间学习能够在全球范围内提供及时的沙尘警报，使用更宽的输入窗口或注意力模型可能进一步揑锐边缘检测效果

Abstract: Dust storms harm health and reduce visibility; quick detection from
satellites is needed. We present a near real-time system that flags dust at the
pixel level using multi-band images from NASA's Terra and Aqua (MODIS). A 3D
convolutional network learns patterns across all 36 bands, plus split thermal
bands, to separate dust from clouds and surface features. Simple normalization
and local filling handle missing data. An improved version raises training
speed by 21x and supports fast processing of full scenes. On 17 independent
MODIS scenes, the model reaches about 0.92 accuracy with a mean squared error
of 0.014. Maps show strong agreement in plume cores, with most misses along
edges. These results show that joint band-and-space learning can provide timely
dust alerts at global scale; using wider input windows or attention-based
models may further sharpen edges.

TL;DR: 对心血管疾病病理图像分割模型的系统评估显示，在数据稀缺情况下模型性能很容易受到数据分割的影响，标准测试方法在临床应用中存在限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心血管疾病病理图像注释数据稀缺，影响深度学习模型开发，需要系统评估各种先进分割模型在这一领域的表现。

Method: 使用贝叶斯搜索进行深度调优，对深度学习分割模型（U-Net、DeepLabV3+、SegFormer、SAM、MedSAM、MedSAM+UNet）在有限的心血血管病理图像数据集上进行系统评测。

Result: 模型性能对数据分割极其敏感，小的性能差异更多是统计噪声而非算法优势的真实反映，性能排名不能正确体现临床效用。

Conclusion: 标准测试方法在数据稀缺的临床环境中存在显著限制，需要重新考虑如何评估模型的真实临床价值。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of carotid artery structures in histopathological
images is vital for advancing cardiovascular disease research and diagnosis.
However, deep learning model development in this domain is constrained by the
scarcity of annotated cardiovascular histopathological data. This study
investigates a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning
segmentation models, including convolutional neural networks (U-Net,
DeepLabV3+), a Vision Transformer (SegFormer), and recent foundation models
(SAM, MedSAM, MedSAM+UNet), on a limited dataset of cardiovascular histology
images. Despite employing an extensive hyperparameter optimization strategy
with Bayesian search, our findings reveal that model performance is highly
sensitive to data splits, with minor differences driven more by statistical
noise than by true algorithmic superiority. This instability exposes the
limitations of standard benchmarking practices in low-data clinical settings
and challenges the assumption that performance rankings reflect meaningful
clinical utility.

TL;DR: BTCChat是一个用于双时相卫星图像分析的多模态大语言模型，通过创新的变化提取模块和提示增强机制，在变化描述和视觉问答任务上达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过直接拼接处理图像对，无法充分建模时间相关性和空间语义变化，限制了变化理解中的视觉语义对齐效果

Method: 提出BTCChat模型，包含变化提取模块来捕获时间特征和空间语义变化，以及提示增强机制来提升对空间细节的关注

Result: 实验结果表明BTCChat在变化描述和视觉问答任务上实现了最先进的性能

Conclusion: BTCChat通过专门设计的变化理解模块有效提升了双时相图像分析的性能，为城市发展监测和灾害评估等应用提供了更好的解决方案

Abstract: Bi-temporal satellite imagery supports critical applications such as urban
development monitoring and disaster assessment. Although powerful multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have been applied in bi-temporal change analysis,
previous methods process image pairs through direct concatenation, inadequately
modeling temporal correlations and spatial semantic changes. This deficiency
hampers visual-semantic alignment in change understanding, thereby constraining
the overall effectiveness of current approaches. To address this gap, we
propose BTCChat, a multi-temporal MLLM with advanced bi-temporal change
understanding capability. BTCChat supports bi-temporal change captioning and
retains single-image interpretation capability. To better capture temporal
features and spatial semantic changes in image pairs, we design a Change
Extraction module. Moreover, to enhance the model's attention to spatial
details, we introduce a Prompt Augmentation mechanism, which incorporates
contextual clues into the prompt to enhance model performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that BTCChat achieves state-of-the-art performance on
change captioning and visual question answering tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViSK-GAT是一个多模态深度学习框架，结合视觉和骨骼坐标特征来分类肌肉骨骼风险，在复杂环境中实现了93%以上的准确率，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有肌肉骨骼风险评估方法大多依赖单一数据类型，在复杂环境中可靠性不足。需要开发能够融合多模态数据的可靠风险评估系统，以便早期预防运动员的肌肉骨骼疾病。

Method: 提出ViSK-GAT框架，结合残差块和轻量级Transformer块学习时空依赖关系。包含两个新模块：细粒度注意力模块（FGAM）通过跨模态注意力精炼特征，多模态几何对应模块（MGCM）对齐图像特征与坐标表示。构建了包含8个风险类别的多模态数据集。

Result: 验证准确率93.55%，测试准确率93.89%，精确率93.86%，F1分数93.85%，Cohen's Kappa和Matthews相关系数均为93%。回归结果显示RMSE为0.1205，MAE为0.0156，显著优于9个流行的迁移学习骨干网络。

Conclusion: ViSK-GAT模型推动了人工智能在肌肉骨骼风险分类中的应用，能够实现有效的早期干预，为运动医学提供了强有力的工具。

Abstract: Musculoskeletal disorders pose significant risks to athletes, and assessing
risk early is important for prevention. However, most existing methods are
designed for controlled settings and fail to reliably assess risk in complex
environments due to their reliance on a single type of data. This research
proposes ViSK-GAT (Visual-Skeletal Geometric Attention Transformer), a novel
multimodal deep learning framework designed to classify musculoskeletal risk
using visual and skeletal coordinate-based features. In addition, a custom
multimodal dataset is constructed by combining visual data and skeletal
coordinates for risk assessment. Each sample is labeled into eight risk
categories based on the Rapid Entire Body Assessment system. ViSK-GAT combines
a Residual Block with a Lightweight Transformer Block to learn spatial and
temporal dependencies jointly. It incorporates two novel modules: the
Fine-Grained Attention Module (FGAM), which enables precise inter-modal feature
refinement through cross-attention between visual and skeletal inputs, and the
Multimodal Geometric Correspondence Module (MGCM), which enhances cross-modal
coherence by aligning image features with coordinate-based representations.
ViSK-GAT achieved strong performance with validation and test accuracies of
93.55\% and 93.89\%, respectively; a precision of 93.86\%; an F1 score of
93.85\%; and Cohen's Kappa and Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 93\%. The
regression results also indicated a low Root Mean Square Error of the predicted
probability distribution of 0.1205 and a corresponding Mean Absolute Error of
0.0156. Compared to nine popular transfer learning backbones, ViSK-GAT
consistently outperformed previous methods. The ViSK-GAT model advances
artificial intelligence implementation and application, transforming
musculoskeletal risk classification and enabling impactful early interventions
in sports.

*Ruiqi Shen,Haotian Wu,Wenjing Zhang,Jiangjing Hu,Deniz Gunduz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于CLIP模型的语义压缩方法，通过压缩特征嵌入而非像素重建，在极低比特率（2-3*10^-3 bpp）下保持语义完整性，性能优于主流图像压缩方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新兴应用更关注语义保持而非像素级重建，需要跨数据分布和下游任务的鲁棒性能，多模态基础模型的零样本能力为此提供了新思路

Method: 利用对比语言-图像预训练（CLIP）模型，将CLIP特征嵌入压缩为最小比特，同时保持不同任务间的语义信息

Result: 在基准数据集上保持语义完整性，平均比特率约2-3*10^-3 bpp，比主流图像压缩方法所需比特率少95%，在极端压缩下仍具有零样本鲁棒性

Conclusion: 基于CLIP的语义压缩方法实现了高效的语义保持压缩，在极低比特率下展现出跨数据分布和下游任务的强大零样本鲁棒性能

Abstract: Recent deep learning-based methods for lossy image compression achieve
competitive rate-distortion performance through extensive end-to-end training
and advanced architectures. However, emerging applications increasingly
prioritize semantic preservation over pixel-level reconstruction and demand
robust performance across diverse data distributions and downstream tasks.
These challenges call for advanced semantic compression paradigms. Motivated by
the zero-shot and representational capabilities of multimodal foundation
models, we propose a novel semantic compression method based on the contrastive
language-image pretraining (CLIP) model. Rather than compressing images for
reconstruction, we propose compressing the CLIP feature embeddings into minimal
bits while preserving semantic information across different tasks. Experiments
show that our method maintains semantic integrity across benchmark datasets,
achieving an average bit rate of approximately 2-3* 10(-3) bits per pixel. This
is less than 5% of the bitrate required by mainstream image compression
approaches for comparable performance. Remarkably, even under extreme
compression, the proposed approach exhibits zero-shot robustness across diverse
data distributions and downstream tasks.

TL;DR: AttriPrompt是一个新颖的深度提示学习框架，通过利用CLIP视觉编码器的中间层特征来增强文本语义表示，解决了现有方法过度依赖对比学习和静态提示的问题，在多个基准测试中实现了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度文本提示方法存在两个关键局限：过度依赖对比学习目标而忽视细粒度特征优化；所有输入类别使用静态提示，缺乏内容感知适应能力。

Method: 提出AttriPrompt框架，包含属性检索模块（聚类视觉特征并检索语义相似提示）、双流对比学习实现细粒度对齐，以及自正则化机制防止过拟合。

Result: 在三个基准测试中优于最先进方法，在base-to-novel设置下实现了最高7.37%的性能提升，在跨域知识迁移方面表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法使视觉语言预训练模型成为现实世界应用中更可行的解决方案，通过分层视觉信息和动态提示机制显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: The evolution of prompt learning methodologies has driven exploration of
deeper prompt designs to enhance model performance. However, current deep text
prompting approaches suffer from two critical limitations: Over-reliance on
constrastive learning objectives that prioritize high-level semantic alignment,
neglecting fine-grained feature optimization; Static prompts across all input
categories, preventing content-aware adaptation. To address these limitations,
we propose AttriPrompt-a novel framework that enhances and refines textual
semantic representations by leveraging the intermediate-layer features of
CLIP's vision encoder. We designed an Attribute Retrieval module that first
clusters visual features from each layer. The aggregated visual features
retrieve semantically similar prompts from a prompt pool, which are then
concatenated to the input of every layer in the text encoder. Leveraging
hierarchical visual information embedded in prompted text features, we
introduce Dual-stream Contrastive Learning to realize fine-grained alignment.
Furthermore, we introduce a Self-Regularization mechanism by applying explicit
regularization constraints between the prompted and non-prompted text features
to prevent overfitting on limited training data. Extensive experiments across
three benchmarks demonstrate AttriPrompt's superiority over state-of-the-art
methods, achieving up to 7.37\% improvement in the base-to-novel setting. The
observed strength of our method in cross-domain knowledge transfer positions
vision-language pre-trained models as more viable solutions for real-world
implementation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SDE-based采样在Flow Matching中引入明显噪声伪影，对奖励学习过程有害，需要解决这个问题以提高RL在图像生成中的应用效果。

Method: 受DDIM启发，提出Coefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS)方法，重新制定采样过程，消除噪声伪影。

Result: CPS方法消除了噪声伪影，实现了更准确的奖励建模，使Flow-GRPO和Dance-GRPO等RL优化器收敛更快更稳定。

Conclusion: CPS方法有效解决了SDE采样中的噪声问题，为强化学习在Flow Matching模型中的应用提供了更稳定高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently emerged as a powerful technique for
improving image and video generation in Diffusion and Flow Matching models,
specifically for enhancing output quality and alignment with prompts. A
critical step for applying online RL methods on Flow Matching is the
introduction of stochasticity into the deterministic framework, commonly
realized by Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE). Our investigation reveals a
significant drawback to this approach: SDE-based sampling introduces pronounced
noise artifacts in the generated images, which we found to be detrimental to
the reward learning process. A rigorous theoretical analysis traces the origin
of this noise to an excess of stochasticity injected during inference. To
address this, we draw inspiration from Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models
(DDIM) to reformulate the sampling process. Our proposed method,
Coefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS), eliminates these noise artifacts. This
leads to more accurate reward modeling, ultimately enabling faster and more
stable convergence for reinforcement learning-based optimizers like Flow-GRPO
and Dance-GRPO. Code will be released at https://github.com/IamCreateAI/FlowCPS

Conclusion: 提出的DIFM模块能够有效利用原始和增强图像的互补信息，结合多尺度边界损失显著提高了医学图像分割的准确性

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a crucial method for assisting professionals in
diagnosing various diseases through medical imaging. However, various factors
such as noise, blurriness, and low contrast often hinder the accurate diagnosis
of diseases. While numerous image enhancement techniques can mitigate these
issues, they may also alter crucial information needed for accurate diagnosis
in the original image. Conventional image fusion strategies, such as feature
concatenation can address this challenge. However, they struggle to fully
leverage the advantages of both original and enhanced images while suppressing
the side effects of the enhancements. To overcome the problem, we propose a
dual interactive fusion module (DIFM) that effectively exploits mutual
complementary information from the original and enhanced images. DIFM employs
cross-attention bidirectionally to simultaneously attend to corresponding
spatial information across different images, subsequently refining the
complementary features via global spatial attention. This interaction leverages
low- to high-level features implicitly associated with diverse structural
attributes like edges, blobs, and object shapes, resulting in enhanced features
that embody important spatial characteristics. In addition, we introduce a
multi-scale boundary loss based on gradient extraction to improve segmentation
accuracy at object boundaries. Experimental results on the ACDC and Synapse
datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method quantitatively and
qualitatively. Code available at: https://github.com/JJeong-Gari/DIN

memory requirements. To address this, we introduce StripDet, a novel
lightweight framework designed for on-device efficiency. First, we propose the
novel Strip Attention Block (SAB), a highly efficient module designed to
capture long-range spatial dependencies. By decomposing standard 2D

directional features while reducing computational complexity from quadratic to
linear. Second, we design a hardware-friendly hierarchical backbone that
integrates SAB with depthwise separable convolutions and a simple multiscale
fusion strategy, achieving end-to-end efficiency. Extensive experiments on the
KITTI dataset validate StripDet's superiority. With only 0.65M parameters, our
model achieves a 79.97% mAP for car detection, surpassing the baseline
PointPillars with a 7x parameter reduction. Furthermore, StripDet outperforms
recent lightweight and knowledge distillation-based methods, achieving a
superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off while establishing itself as a practical

Abstract: We propose a novel method to generate bloom lighting effect in real time
using neural networks. Our solution generate brightness mask from given 3D
scene view up to 30% faster than state-of-the-art methods. The existing
traditional techniques rely on multiple blur appliances and texture sampling,
also very often have existing conditional branching in its implementation.
These operations occupy big portion of the execution time. We solve this
problem by proposing two neural network-based bloom lighting methods, Neural
Bloom Lighting (NBL) and Fast Neural Bloom Lighting (FastNBL), focusing on
their quality and performance. Both methods were tested on a variety of 3D
scenes, with evaluations conducted on brightness mask accuracy and inference
speed. The main contribution of this work is that both methods produce
high-quality bloom effects while outperforming the standard state-of-the-art
bloom implementation, with FastNBL being faster by 28% and NBL faster by 12%.
These findings highlight that we can achieve realistic bloom lighting phenomena
faster, moving us towards more realism in real-time environments in the future.
This improvement saves computational resources, which is a major bottleneck in
real-time rendering. Furthermore, it is crucial for sustaining immersion and
ensuring smooth experiences in high FPS environments, while maintaining
high-quality realism.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了医学3D影像自监督学习中可解释性不足的问题，通过空间语义捕获和多粒度建模，在保持性能的同时增强了学习过程的可理解性。

Abstract: The application of self-supervised techniques has become increasingly
prevalent within medical visualization tasks, primarily due to its capacity to
mitigate the data scarcity prevalent in the healthcare sector. The majority of
current works are influenced by designs originating in the generic 2D visual
domain, which lack the intuitive demonstration of the model's learning process
regarding 3D spatial knowledge. Consequently, these methods often fall short in
terms of medical interpretability. We propose a method consisting of three
sub-tasks to capture the spatially relevant semantics in medical 3D imaging.
Their design adheres to observable principles to ensure interpretability, and
minimize the performance loss caused thereby as much as possible. By leveraging
the enhanced semantic depth offered by the extra dimension in 3D imaging, this
approach incorporates multi-granularity spatial relationship modeling to
maintain training stability. Experimental findings suggest that our approach is
capable of delivering performance that is on par with current methodologies,
while facilitating an intuitive understanding of the self-supervised learning
process.

Conclusion: 通过去风格化的可扩展数据生成提供了可靠的监督范式，克服了艺术风格迁移中缺乏真实数据的根本挑战

Abstract: OmniStyle2 introduces a novel approach to artistic style transfer by
reframing it as a data problem. Our key insight is destylization, reversing
style transfer by removing stylistic elements from artworks to recover natural,
style-free counterparts. This yields DST-100K, a large-scale dataset that
provides authentic supervision signals by aligning real artistic styles with
their underlying content. To build DST-100K, we develop (1) DST, a text-guided
destylization model that reconstructs stylefree content, and (2) DST-Filter, a
multi-stage evaluation model that employs Chain-of-Thought reasoning to
automatically discard low-quality pairs while ensuring content fidelity and
style accuracy. Leveraging DST-100K, we train OmniStyle2, a simple feed-forward
model based on FLUX.1-dev. Despite its simplicity, OmniStyle2 consistently
surpasses state-of-the-art methods across both qualitative and quantitative
benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that scalable data generation via
destylization provides a reliable supervision paradigm, overcoming the
fundamental challenge posed by the lack of ground-truth data in artistic style
transfer.

*Nam Duong Tran,Nam Nguyen Phuong,Hieu H. Pham,Phi Le Nguyen,My T. Thai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ConstStyle提出了一种新的域泛化方法，通过将训练和测试数据映射到统一的域来捕获域不变特征并弥合域差距，在有限训练域和大域差距情况下显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在测试数据分布与训练数据不同时性能下降，现有域泛化方法在处理有限训练域或大域差距时存在困难。需要让模型在更接近未见测试域的域上进行训练，但由于缺乏对未见域的先验知识，这具有挑战性。

Method: 提出ConstStyle方法：1）构建统一域来捕获域不变特征；2）训练时将样本映射到该统一域进行优化；3）测试时将未见域样本同样投影到统一域再进行预测；4）通过理论分析确保方法的有效性。

Result: 大量实验表明ConstStyle在各种场景下一致优于现有方法。特别是在只有有限可见域可用时，相比次优方法准确率可提升高达19.82%。

Conclusion: ConstStyle通过统一域的对齐有效减少了域偏移的影响，即使在大域差距或少量可见域的情况下也能显著提升域泛化性能，为解决域泛化问题提供了有效的新思路。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often suffer performance drops when test data
distribution differs from training data. Domain Generalization (DG) aims to
address this by focusing on domain-invariant features or augmenting data for
greater diversity. However, these methods often struggle with limited training
domains or significant gaps between seen (training) and unseen (test) domains.
To enhance DG robustness, we hypothesize that it is essential for the model to
be trained on data from domains that closely resemble unseen test domains-an
inherently difficult task due to the absence of prior knowledge about the
unseen domains. Accordingly, we propose ConstStyle, a novel approach that
leverages a unified domain to capture domain-invariant features and bridge the
domain gap with theoretical analysis. During training, all samples are mapped
onto this unified domain, optimized for seen domains. During testing, unseen
domain samples are projected similarly before predictions. By aligning both
training and testing data within this unified domain, ConstStyle effectively
reduces the impact of domain shifts, even with large domain gaps or few seen
domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConstStyle consistently
outperforms existing methods across diverse scenarios. Notably, when only a
limited number of seen domains are available, ConstStyle can boost accuracy up
to 19.82\% compared to the next best approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出STRIDE扩散模型用于稀疏视图CT重建，通过时间变化稀疏条件重加权策略和双网络并行架构，在PSNR、SSIM和MSE指标上显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像处理任务中展现出强大的生成能力，但需要专门的方法来解决稀疏视图CT重建中的投影视图补全和全局信息建模问题。

Method: 设计联合训练机制和时序变化稀疏条件重加权策略，采用线性回归校正分布偏移，构建双网络并行架构进行多子频段全局校正和优化。

Result: 在公开和真实数据集上，PSNR提升2.58dB，SSIM提高2.37%，MSE降低0.236，重建图像在结构一致性、细节恢复和伪影抑制方面表现优异。

Conclusion: STRIDE模型通过创新的稀疏条件引导和双网络架构，有效提升了稀疏视图CT重建的质量，具有良好的泛化性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities in
image processing tasks. We propose a Sparse condition Temporal Rewighted
Integrated Distribution Estimation guided diffusion model (STRIDE) for
sparse-view CT reconstruction. Specifically, we design a joint training
mechanism guided by sparse conditional probabilities to facilitate the model
effective learning of missing projection view completion and global information
modeling. Based on systematic theoretical analysis, we propose a temporally
varying sparse condition reweighting guidance strategy to dynamically adjusts
weights during the progressive denoising process from pure noise to the real
image, enabling the model to progressively perceive sparse-view information.
The linear regression is employed to correct distributional shifts between
known and generated data, mitigating inconsistencies arising during the
guidance process. Furthermore, we construct a dual-network parallel
architecture to perform global correction and optimization across multiple
sub-frequency components, thereby effectively improving the model capability in
both detail restoration and structural preservation, ultimately achieving
high-quality image reconstruction. Experimental results on both public and real
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the best improvement of
2.58 dB in PSNR, increase of 2.37\% in SSIM, and reduction of 0.236 in MSE
compared to the best-performing baseline methods. The reconstructed images
exhibit excellent generalization and robustness in terms of structural
consistency, detail restoration, and artifact suppression.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于预计算分割信息先验的解耦策略，通过将分割信息直接融合到特征空间来指导3D目标检测，无需扩展检测模型或联合学习先验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目3D目标检测由于输入是单张2D图像，缺乏深度线索，使得深度估计成为一个不适定问题。现有方法主要依赖CNN或Transformer提取特征，然后通过特定检测头预测3D参数。

Method: 采用解耦策略，注入预计算的分割信息先验并直接融合到特征空间来指导检测，不扩展检测模型或联合学习先验，专注于评估分割信息对现有检测流程的影响。

Result: 在KITTI 3D目标检测基准上评估，相比仅依赖RGB图像特征的等效架构，在小目标（行人和骑行者）检测方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 理解输入数据可以平衡对额外传感器或训练数据的需求，分割信息的引入能有效提升单目3D目标检测性能。

Abstract: Monocular 3D Object Detection represents a challenging Computer Vision task
due to the nature of the input used, which is a single 2D image, lacking in any
depth cues and placing the depth estimation problem as an ill-posed one.
Existing solutions leverage the information extracted from the input by using
Convolutional Neural Networks or Transformer architectures as feature
extraction backbones, followed by specific detection heads for 3D parameters
prediction. In this paper, we introduce a decoupled strategy based on injecting
precomputed segmentation information priors and fusing them directly into the
feature space for guiding the detection, without expanding the detection model
or jointly learning the priors. The focus is on evaluating the impact of
additional segmentation information on existing detection pipelines without
adding additional prediction branches. The proposed method is evaluated on the
KITTI 3D Object Detection Benchmark, outperforming the equivalent architecture
that relies only on RGB image features for small objects in the scene:
pedestrians and cyclists, and proving that understanding the input data can
balance the need for additional sensors or training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单目6自由度位姿估计方法主要依赖静态关键点定位，未能充分利用空间操作中固有的宝贵时序信息。

Method: 采用从人体姿态估计领域迁移的深度学习框架，整合运动感知热图和光流来捕捉运动动态。使用Vision Transformer编码器提取图像特征，结合预训练光流模型的运动线索进行2D关键点定位，最后通过PnP求解器从已知2D-3D对应关系恢复6自由度位姿。

Result: 在SPADES-RGB数据集上训练和评估，并在SPARK-2024数据集的真实和合成数据上测试泛化能力。在2D关键点定位和6自由度位姿估计方面均优于单图像基线方法，并在不同数据分布上展现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过整合时序运动信息，显著提升了单目6自由度位姿估计的性能，特别是在航天器姿态估计领域具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Monocular 6-DoF pose estimation plays an important role in multiple
spacecraft missions. Most existing pose estimation approaches rely on single
images with static keypoint localisation, failing to exploit valuable temporal
information inherent to space operations. In this work, we adapt a deep
learning framework from human pose estimation to the spacecraft pose estimation
domain that integrates motion-aware heatmaps and optical flow to capture motion
dynamics. Our approach combines image features from a Vision Transformer (ViT)
encoder with motion cues from a pre-trained optical flow model to localise 2D
keypoints. Using the estimates, a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) solver recovers
6-DoF poses from known 2D-3D correspondences. We train and evaluate our method
on the SPADES-RGB dataset and further assess its generalisation on real and
synthetic data from the SPARK-2024 dataset. Overall, our approach demonstrates
improved performance over single-image baselines in both 2D keypoint
localisation and 6-DoF pose estimation. Furthermore, it shows promising
generalisation capabilities when testing on different data distributions.

Motivation: 现有食物图像数据集缺乏对印度美食多样性的覆盖，印度菜具有区域多样性、复杂制作工艺等特点，需要专门的数据集来支持相关AI应用开发。

Method: 建立了印度美食分类体系，收集了约13.1万张500x500像素的图像，涵盖80个印度菜肴类别，并提供了数据集的创建过程和基准模型评估。

Result: 创建了Khana数据集，为研究者提供了全面的基准测试资源，同时为开发者开发实际应用提供了有价值的印度美食图像数据。

Conclusion: Khana数据集填补了印度美食AI研究的空白，为食品识别、食谱推荐、饮食追踪等应用提供了重要基础，架起了研究与实际应用之间的桥梁。

Abstract: As global interest in diverse culinary experiences grows, food image models
are essential for improving food-related applications by enabling accurate food
recognition, recipe suggestions, dietary tracking, and automated meal planning.
Despite the abundance of food datasets, a noticeable gap remains in capturing
the nuances of Indian cuisine due to its vast regional diversity, complex
preparations, and the lack of comprehensive labeled datasets that cover its
full breadth. Through this exploration, we uncover Khana, a new benchmark
dataset for food image classification, segmentation, and retrieval of dishes
from Indian cuisine. Khana fills the gap by establishing a taxonomy of Indian
cuisine and offering around 131K images in the dataset spread across 80 labels,
each with a resolution of 500x500 pixels. This paper describes the dataset
creation process and evaluates state-of-the-art models on classification,
segmentation, and retrieval as baselines. Khana bridges the gap between
research and development by providing a comprehensive and challenging benchmark
for researchers while also serving as a valuable resource for developers
creating real-world applications that leverage the rich tapestry of Indian
cuisine. Webpage: https://khana.omkar.xyz

TL;DR: BLaVe-CoT是一个针对盲人和低视力用户的VQA框架，通过多候选答案生成、空间定位和思维链推理来处理视觉问答中的模糊性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VQA系统假设单一答案和区域，但盲人和低视力用户拍摄的照片模糊、构图差，问题表述模糊，导致多个有效答案，需要系统能够处理这种模糊性

Method: 使用LoRA调优的BLIP-2模型生成多个候选答案，用PolyFormer进行空间定位，然后通过思维链推理模块评估答案是否指向相同或不同区域

Result: 在VQA-AnswerTherapy基准测试中优于先前方法，对辅助场景中常见的模糊性和视觉噪声更具鲁棒性

Conclusion: VQA系统需要适应真实人类的不确定性，为盲人和低视力用户提供包容性支持，该工作推动了相关研究和可访问性应用的发展

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) holds great potential for assisting Blind and
Low Vision (BLV) users, yet real-world usage remains challenging. Due to visual
impairments, BLV users often take blurry or poorly framed photos and face
difficulty in articulating specific questions about what they cannot fully see.
As a result, their visual questions are frequently ambiguous, and different
users may interpret them in diverse ways. This leads to multiple valid answers,
each grounded in different image regions-posing a mismatch with conventional
VQA systems that assume a single answer and region. To bridge this gap, we
present BLaVe-CoT, a VQA framework designed to reason about answer consistency
in the face of ambiguity. Our method proposes diverse candidate answers using a
LoRA-tuned BLIP-2 model, then grounds each answer spatially using PolyFormer,
and finally applies a chain-of-thought reasoning module to assess whether the
answers refer to the same or different regions. Evaluated on the
VQA-AnswerTherapy benchmark, BLaVe-CoT outperforms previous methods and proves
more robust to the ambiguity and visual noise common in assistive settings.
This work highlights the need for VQA systems that can adapt to real human
uncertainty and provide inclusive support for BLV users. To foster further
research and accessibility applications, we have made the code publicly
available at https://github.com/Accecwan/BLaVe-CoT.

Conclusion: 该轻量级令牌剪枝框架有效地降低了VLMs的计算要求，为高效文档理解提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs) has led to impressive
results in document understanding tasks, but their high computational demands
remain a challenge. To mitigate the compute burdens, we propose a lightweight
token pruning framework that filters out non-informative background regions
from document images prior to VLM processing. A binary patch-level classifier
removes non-text areas, and a max-pooling refinement step recovers fragmented
text regions to enhance spatial coherence. Experiments on real-world document
datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially lowers computational
costs, while maintaining comparable accuracy.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVD) has emerged as a pivotal technology
for applications involving Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, the
prevailing large-scale datasets for OVD pre-training are predominantly composed
of ground-level, natural images. This creates a significant domain gap, causing
models trained on them to exhibit a substantial drop in performance on UAV
imagery. To address this limitation, we first propose a refined UAV-Label
engine. Then we construct and introduce UAVDE-2M(contains over 2,000,000
instances and 1800 categories) and UAVCAP-15k(contains over 15,000 images).
Furthermore, we propose a novel Cross-Attention Gated Enhancement Fusion (CAGE)
module and integrate it into the YOLO-World-v2 architecture. Finally, extensive
experiments on the VisDrone and SIMD datasets verify the effectiveness of our
proposed method for applications in UAV-based imagery and remote sensing.

Motivation: 面部微表情识别面临着表情过度短暂、细微和动态性的挑战。现有方法中，手工特征需要关键帧，深度网络则受限于小规模和低多样性的训练数据。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的FDP框架通过动态信息编码和助正任务设计，有效地解决了微表情识别中的动态性、细微性和数据稀缺挑战，为微表情识别领域提供了一种有效的新方法。

Abstract: Facial micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task, due to the
transience, subtlety, and dynamics of micro-expressions (MEs). Most existing
methods resort to hand-crafted features or deep networks, in which the former
often additionally requires key frames, and the latter suffers from small-scale
and low-diversity training data. In this paper, we develop a novel fine-grained
dynamic perception (FDP) framework for MER. We propose to rank frame-level
features of a sequence of raw frames in chronological order, in which the rank
process encodes the dynamic information of both ME appearances and motions.
Specifically, a novel local-global feature-aware transformer is proposed for
frame representation learning. A rank scorer is further adopted to calculate
rank scores of each frame-level feature. Afterwards, the rank features from
rank scorer are pooled in temporal dimension to capture dynamic representation.
Finally, the dynamic representation is shared by a MER module and a dynamic
image construction module, in which the former predicts the ME category, and
the latter uses an encoder-decoder structure to construct the dynamic image.
The design of dynamic image construction task is beneficial for capturing
facial subtle actions associated with MEs and alleviating the data scarcity
issue. Extensive experiments show that our method (i) significantly outperforms
the state-of-the-art MER methods, and (ii) works well for dynamic image
construction. Particularly, our FDP improves by 4.05%, 2.50%, 7.71%, and 2.11%
over the previous best results in terms of F1-score on the CASME II, SAMM,
CAS(ME)^2, and CAS(ME)^3 datasets, respectively. The code is available at

Conclusion: DVLO4D通过创新的稀疏时空融合方法有效解决了传统视觉-LiDAR里程计的局限性，实现了高精度、强鲁棒性和高效率的定位性能。

Abstract: Visual-LiDAR odometry is a critical component for autonomous system
localization, yet achieving high accuracy and strong robustness remains a
challenge. Traditional approaches commonly struggle with sensor misalignment,
fail to fully leverage temporal information, and require extensive manual
tuning to handle diverse sensor configurations. To address these problems, we
introduce DVLO4D, a novel visual-LiDAR odometry framework that leverages sparse
spatial-temporal fusion to enhance accuracy and robustness. Our approach
proposes three key innovations: (1) Sparse Query Fusion, which utilizes sparse
LiDAR queries for effective multi-modal data fusion; (2) a Temporal Interaction
and Update module that integrates temporally-predicted positions with current
frame data, providing better initialization values for pose estimation and
enhancing model's robustness against accumulative errors; and (3) a Temporal
Clip Training strategy combined with a Collective Average Loss mechanism that
aggregates losses across multiple frames, enabling global optimization and
reducing the scale drift over long sequences. Extensive experiments on the
KITTI and Argoverse Odometry dataset demonstrate the superiority of our
proposed DVLO4D, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both
pose accuracy and robustness. Additionally, our method has high efficiency,
with an inference time of 82 ms, possessing the potential for the real-time

responded. The findings suggest that general-purpose VLMs are a practical and
promising technology for developing patient-facing tools for preliminary blood

Conclusion: 集成细节保留下采样、边缘敏感表征、双域注意力和难度适配回归的方法，为基于UAV的电网小缺陷检测提供了实用高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated inspection of transmission lines using UAVs is hindered by the
difficulty of detecting small and ambiguous defects against complex
backgrounds. Conventional detectors often suffer from detail loss due to
strided downsampling, weak boundary sensitivity in lightweight backbones, and
insufficient integration of global context with local cues. To address these
challenges, we propose TinyDef-DETR, a DETR-based framework designed for
small-defect detection. The method introduces a stride-free space-to-depth
module for lossless downsampling, an edge-enhanced convolution for
boundary-aware feature extraction, a cross-stage dual-domain multi-scale
attention module to jointly capture global and local information, and a
Focaler-Wise-SIoU regression loss to improve localization of small objects.
Experiments conducted on the CSG-ADCD dataset demonstrate that TinyDef-DETR
achieves substantial improvements in both precision and recall compared to
competitive baselines, with particularly notable gains on small-object subsets,
while incurring only modest computational overhead. Further validation on the
VisDrone benchmark confirms the generalization capability of the proposed
approach. Overall, the results indicate that integrating detail-preserving
downsampling, edge-sensitive representations, dual-domain attention, and
difficulty-adaptive regression provides a practical and efficient solution for
UAV-based small-defect inspection in power grids.

Abstract: Recent advancements in aligning image and video generative models via GRPO
have achieved remarkable gains in enhancing human preference alignment.
However, these methods still face high computational costs from on-policy
rollouts and excessive SDE sampling steps, as well as training instability due
to sparse rewards. In this paper, we propose BranchGRPO, a novel method that
introduces a branch sampling policy updating the SDE sampling process. By
sharing computation across common prefixes and pruning low-reward paths and
redundant depths, BranchGRPO substantially lowers the per-update compute cost
while maintaining or improving exploration diversity. This work makes three
main contributions: (1) a branch sampling scheme that reduces rollout and
training cost; (2) a tree-based advantage estimator incorporating dense
process-level rewards; and (3) pruning strategies exploiting path and depth
redundancy to accelerate convergence and boost performance. Experiments on
image and video preference alignment show that BranchGRPO improves alignment
scores by 16% over strong baselines, while cutting training time by 50%.

Abstract: Buoyancy-driven heat transfer in closed cavities serves as a canonical
testbed for thermal design High-fidelity CFD modelling yields accurate thermal
field solutions, yet its reliance on expert-crafted physics models, fine
meshes, and intensive computation limits rapid iteration. Recent developments
in data-driven modeling, especially Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer new
alternatives for learning thermal-fluid behavior directly from simulation data,
particularly on irregular mesh structures. However, conventional GNNs often
struggle to capture long-range dependencies in high-resolution graph
structures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multi-stage GNN
architecture that leverages hierarchical pooling and unpooling operations to
progressively model global-to-local interactions across multiple spatial
scales. We evaluate the proposed model on our newly developed CFD dataset
simulating natural convection within a rectangular cavities with varying aspect
ratios where the bottom wall is isothermal hot, the top wall is isothermal
cold, and the two vertical walls are adiabatic. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves higher predictive accuracy,
improved training efficiency, and reduced long-term error accumulation compared
to state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN baselines. These findings underscore the
potential of the proposed multi-stage GNN approach for modeling complex heat
transfer in mesh-based fluid dynamics simulations.

TL;DR: IRG框架通过交替文本推理和图像合成来提升文本到图像生成质量，在多个基准测试中取得5-10个百分点的绝对提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统一多模态理解生成模型在图像生成能力上有显著进步，但在指令遵循和细节保持方面仍与GPT-4o等紧密耦合理解与生成的系统存在差距

Method: 提出Interleaving Reasoning Generation (IRG)框架，交替进行文本推理和图像合成：首先生成文本思考指导初始图像，然后通过反思细化细节、视觉质量和美学效果；使用IRGL-300K数据集进行两阶段训练

Result: 在GenEval、WISE、TIIF、GenAI-Bench和OneIG-EN等基准测试中实现最先进性能，获得5-10个百分点的绝对增益，视觉质量和细粒度保真度有显著改善

Conclusion: 交替推理方法能有效提升文本到图像生成的质量和细节保持能力，IRG框架在多个评估指标上表现出色

Abstract: Unified multimodal understanding and generation models recently have achieve
significant improvement in image generation capability, yet a large gap remains
in instruction following and detail preservation compared to systems that
tightly couple comprehension with generation such as GPT-4o. Motivated by
recent advances in interleaving reasoning, we explore whether such reasoning
can further improve Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. We introduce Interleaving
Reasoning Generation (IRG), a framework that alternates between text-based
thinking and image synthesis: the model first produces a text-based thinking to
guide an initial image, then reflects on the result to refine fine-grained
details, visual quality, and aesthetics while preserving semantics. To train
IRG effectively, we propose Interleaving Reasoning Generation Learning (IRGL),
which targets two sub-goals: (1) strengthening the initial think-and-generate
stage to establish core content and base quality, and (2) enabling high-quality
textual reflection and faithful implementation of those refinements in a
subsequent image. We curate IRGL-300K, a dataset organized into six decomposed
learning modes that jointly cover learning text-based thinking, and full
thinking-image trajectories. Starting from a unified foundation model that
natively emits interleaved text-image outputs, our two-stage training first
builds robust thinking and reflection, then efficiently tunes the IRG pipeline
in the full thinking-image trajectory data. Extensive experiments show SoTA
performance, yielding absolute gains of 5-10 points on GenEval, WISE, TIIF,
GenAI-Bench, and OneIG-EN, alongside substantial improvements in visual quality
and fine-grained fidelity. The code, model weights and datasets will be
released in: https://github.com/Osilly/Interleaving-Reasoning-Generation .

Abstract: We introduce Home-made Diffusion Model (HDM), an efficient yet powerful
text-to-image diffusion model optimized for training (and inferring) on
consumer-grade hardware. HDM achieves competitive 1024x1024 generation quality
while maintaining a remarkably low training cost of $535-620 using four RTX5090

feature integration that leads to remarkable compositional consistency; (2) a
comprehensive training recipe that incorporates TREAD acceleration, a novel
shifted square crop strategy for efficient arbitrary aspect-ratio training, and
progressive resolution scaling; and (3) an empirical demonstration that smaller

Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel technique for reconstructing images from
projection-based nano- and microtomography. Our contribution focuses on
enhancing reconstruction quality, particularly for specimen composed of
homogeneous material phases connected by sharp edges. This is accomplished by
training a neural network to identify edges within subpictures. The trained
network is then integrated into a mathematical optimization model, to reduce
artifacts from previous reconstructions. To this end, the optimization approach
favors solutions according to the learned predictions, however may also
determine alternative solutions if these are strongly supported by the raw
data. Hence, our technique successfully incorporates knowledge about the
homogeneity and presence of sharp edges in the sample and thereby eliminates
blurriness. Our results on experimental datasets show significant enhancements
in interface sharpness and material homogeneity compared to benchmark
algorithms. Thus, our technique produces high-quality reconstructions,
showcasing its potential for advancing tomographic imaging techniques.

TL;DR: MedSeqFT是一个针对医学图像分割的序列微调框架，通过最大数据相似性选择和知识保留微调技术，在增量任务学习中显著提升性能并保持预训练知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的并行微调方法无法利用任务间的共享知识，而多任务微调需要同时访问所有数据集且难以支持增量任务集成，因此需要一种能够顺序适应新任务同时保持预训练知识的框架。

Method: 提出MedSeqFT框架，包含两个核心组件：1) 最大数据相似性选择(MDS)来识别最能代表预训练分布的下游样本；2) 基于LoRA的知识蒸馏方案(K&G RFT)来平衡任务特定适应和预训练知识保留。

Result: 在10个3D分割任务的两个多任务数据集上，MedSeqFT平均Dice分数提升3.0%，在未见任务(COVID-19-20和肾脏)上也表现出更好的迁移性，特别是在肿瘤分割方面。

Conclusion: MedSeqFT确立了序列微调作为一种有效且知识保留的范式，能够很好地适应不断演变的临床任务需求。

Abstract: Foundation models have become a promising paradigm for advancing medical
image analysis, particularly for segmentation tasks where downstream
applications often emerge sequentially. Existing fine-tuning strategies,
however, remain limited: parallel fine-tuning isolates tasks and fails to
exploit shared knowledge, while multi-task fine-tuning requires simultaneous
access to all datasets and struggles with incremental task integration. To
address these challenges, we propose MedSeqFT, a sequential fine-tuning
framework that progressively adapts pre-trained models to new tasks while
refining their representational capacity. MedSeqFT introduces two core
components: (1) Maximum Data Similarity (MDS) selection, which identifies
downstream samples most representative of the original pre-training
distribution to preserve general knowledge, and (2) Knowledge and
Generalization Retention Fine-Tuning (K&G RFT), a LoRA-based knowledge
distillation scheme that balances task-specific adaptation with the retention
of pre-trained knowledge. Extensive experiments on two multi-task datasets
covering ten 3D segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSeqFT consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning strategies, yielding substantial
performance gains (e.g., an average Dice improvement of 3.0%). Furthermore,
evaluations on two unseen tasks (COVID-19-20 and Kidney) verify that MedSeqFT
enhances transferability, particularly for tumor segmentation. Visual analyses
of loss landscapes and parameter variations further highlight the robustness of
MedSeqFT. These results establish sequential fine-tuning as an effective,
knowledge-retentive paradigm for adapting foundation models to evolving
clinical tasks. Code will be released.

Method: 设计PathoHR-Bench基准测试评估模型能力，并提出病理特异性视觉语言训练方案，通过生成增强和扰动样本进行多模态对比学习。

Result: 实验评估显示该方法在PathoHR-Bench和六个额外病理数据集上达到最先进性能，证明了其在细粒度病理表征方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效提升视觉语言模型在病理图像分析中的性能，解决了现有模型在复杂跨模态关系建模方面的局限性。

Abstract: Accurate analysis of pathological images is essential for automated tumor
diagnosis but remains challenging due to high structural similarity and subtle
morphological variations in tissue images. Current vision-language (VL) models
often struggle to capture the complex reasoning required for interpreting
structured pathological reports. To address these limitations, we propose
PathoHR-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate VL models' abilities in
hierarchical semantic understanding and compositional reasoning within the
pathology domain. Results of this benchmark reveal that existing VL models fail
to effectively model intricate cross-modal relationships, hence limiting their
applicability in clinical setting. To overcome this, we further introduce a
pathology-specific VL training scheme that generates enhanced and perturbed
samples for multimodal contrastive learning. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on
PathoHR-Bench and six additional pathology datasets, highlighting its
effectiveness in fine-grained pathology representation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动图像聚类在计算机视觉中很重要，但在图像增强应用中受限，主要原因是难以定义对该任务有意义的聚类。

Method: 提出CARDIE无监督算法，基于图像的颜色和亮度内容进行聚类，并引入量化图像增强算法对亮度分布和局部方差影响的方法。

Result: CARDIE产生的聚类比基于语义图像属性的聚类更适合图像增强任务，利用这些聚类重新采样图像增强数据集可以提升色调映射和去噪算法的性能。

Conclusion: CARDIE为图像增强任务提供了更有效的聚类方法，代码已公开在GitHub上以促进采用和确保可复现性。

Abstract: Automatic image clustering is a cornerstone of computer vision, yet its
application to image enhancement remains limited, primarily due to the
difficulty of defining clusters that are meaningful for this specific task. To
address this issue, we introduce CARDIE, an unsupervised algorithm that
clusters images based on their color and luminosity content. In addition, we
introduce a method to quantify the impact of image enhancement algorithms on
luminance distribution and local variance. Using this method, we demonstrate
that CARDIE produces clusters more relevant to image enhancement than those
derived from semantic image attributes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CARDIE
clusters can be leveraged to resample image enhancement datasets, leading to
improved performance for tone mapping and denoising algorithms. To encourage
adoption and ensure reproducibility, we publicly release CARDIE code on our
GitHub.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecSwin3D是一个基于Transformer的模型，能够从多光谱图像生成高光谱图像，同时保持空间和光谱质量，在PSNR、SAM和SSIM指标上显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多光谱和高光谱图像在农业、环境监测和城市规划中有广泛应用，但存在空间分辨率与光谱分辨率的权衡问题。现有方法难以同时保持空间细节和光谱保真度。

Method: 提出SpecSwin3D模型，使用3D移位窗口Transformer框架，采用级联训练策略逐步扩展光谱范围，并设计优化的波段序列来更好地捕捉波段间关系。

Result: 模型在PSNR达到35.82dB，SAM为2.40°，SSIM为0.96，比基线MHF-Net在PSNR上提升5.6dB，ERGAS降低超过一半。在下游任务如土地利用分类和烧毁区域分割中也表现出实用价值。

Conclusion: SpecSwin3D成功解决了多光谱到高光谱图像转换中的空间-光谱保真度问题，通过Transformer架构和创新的训练策略实现了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Multispectral and hyperspectral imagery are widely used in agriculture,
environmental monitoring, and urban planning due to their complementary spatial
and spectral characteristics. A fundamental trade-off persists: multispectral
imagery offers high spatial but limited spectral resolution, while
hyperspectral imagery provides rich spectra at lower spatial resolution. Prior
hyperspectral generation approaches (e.g., pan-sharpening variants, matrix
factorization, CNNs) often struggle to jointly preserve spatial detail and
spectral fidelity. In response, we propose SpecSwin3D, a transformer-based
model that generates hyperspectral imagery from multispectral inputs while
preserving both spatial and spectral quality. Specifically, SpecSwin3D takes
five multispectral bands as input and reconstructs 224 hyperspectral bands at
the same spatial resolution. In addition, we observe that reconstruction errors
grow for hyperspectral bands spectrally distant from the input bands. To
address this, we introduce a cascade training strategy that progressively
expands the spectral range to stabilize learning and improve fidelity.
Moreover, we design an optimized band sequence that strategically repeats and
orders the five selected multispectral bands to better capture pairwise
relations within a 3D shifted-window transformer framework. Quantitatively, our
model achieves a PSNR of 35.82 dB, SAM of 2.40{\deg}, and SSIM of 0.96,
outperforming the baseline MHF-Net by +5.6 dB in PSNR and reducing ERGAS by
more than half. Beyond reconstruction, we further demonstrate the practical
value of SpecSwin3D on two downstream tasks, including land use classification
and burnt area segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI从医学图像中提取生物标志物（如视网膜年龄）存在隐私风险，未经授权的使用可能导致生物信息泄露，需要保护个人隐私。

Method: 采用特征级生成对抗掩蔽机制，结合多对一知识蒸馏策略，利用视网膜基础模型和多个替代年龄编码器，提供对黑盒年龄预测模型的通用防御。

Result: RetinaGuard成功混淆视网膜年龄预测，对图像质量和病理特征表示影响最小，可扩展到其他医学图像生物标志物。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了医学图像生物特征隐私问题，在保护隐私的同时保持了医学图像的临床实用性。

Abstract: The integration of AI with medical images enables the extraction of implicit
image-derived biomarkers for a precise health assessment. Recently, retinal
age, a biomarker predicted from fundus images, is a proven predictor of
systemic disease risks, behavioral patterns, aging trajectory and even
mortality. However, the capability to infer such sensitive biometric data
raises significant privacy risks, where unauthorized use of fundus images could
lead to bioinformation leakage, breaching individual privacy. In response, we
formulate a new research problem of biometric privacy associated with medical
images and propose RetinaGuard, a novel privacy-enhancing framework that
employs a feature-level generative adversarial masking mechanism to obscure
retinal age while preserving image visual quality and disease diagnostic
utility. The framework further utilizes a novel multiple-to-one knowledge
distillation strategy incorporating a retinal foundation model and diverse
surrogate age encoders to enable a universal defense against black-box age
prediction models. Comprehensive evaluations confirm that RetinaGuard
successfully obfuscates retinal age prediction with minimal impact on image
quality and pathological feature representation. RetinaGuard is also flexible
for extension to other medical image derived biomarkers. RetinaGuard is also
flexible for extension to other medical image biomarkers.

Motivation: 为了解决音频-视频生成中训练效率低和标注对齐问题，避免从头训练的性能下降，开发能够同时生成协调音频视频的统一模型。

Method: 采用专家拼接(SoE)技术，深度融合预训练的视频和音乐生成专家模型的对应模块；开发在线标注流水线处理训练数据并生成标签，避免文本标注错位问题。

Conclusion: UniVerse-1通过创新的模型融合和标注技术，实现了高效的音视频协同生成，为研究社区提供了新的基准和开源资源，有助于缩小与Veo3等先进模型的性能差距。

Abstract: We introduce UniVerse-1, a unified, Veo-3-like model capable of
simultaneously generating coordinated audio and video. To enhance training
efficiency, we bypass training from scratch and instead employ a stitching of
experts (SoE) technique. This approach deeply fuses the corresponding blocks of
pre-trained video and music generation experts models, thereby fully leveraging
their foundational capabilities. To ensure accurate annotations and temporal
alignment for both ambient sounds and speech with video content, we developed
an online annotation pipeline that processes the required training data and
generates labels during training process. This strategy circumvents the
performance degradation often caused by misalignment text-based annotations.
Through the synergy of these techniques, our model, after being finetuned on
approximately 7,600 hours of audio-video data, produces results with
well-coordinated audio-visuals for ambient sounds generation and strong
alignment for speech generation. To systematically evaluate our proposed
method, we introduce Verse-Bench, a new benchmark dataset. In an effort to
advance research in audio-video generation and to close the performance gap
with state-of-the-art models such as Veo3, we make our model and code publicly
available. We hope this contribution will benefit the broader research
community. Project page: https://dorniwang.github.io/UniVerse-1/.

Motivation: 现有的视频场景图生成方法通常针对特定粒度（边界框或像素级别），需要任务特定的架构和多阶段训练流程，缺乏统一的解决方案。

Method: 提出UNO框架，使用扩展的slot attention机制将视觉特征分解为对象和关系slot，引入对象时序一致性学习确保跨帧表示一致性，动态三元组预测模块捕获时序交互。

Result: 在标准边界框级别和像素级别VidSGG基准测试中取得有竞争力的性能，同时通过统一设计提高了效率。

Conclusion: UNO证明了统一框架在视频场景图生成任务中的有效性，能够泛化到不同视觉粒度，减少任务特定修改并最大化参数共享。

Abstract: Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) aims to represent dynamic visual
content by detecting objects and modeling their temporal interactions as
structured graphs. Prior studies typically target either coarse-grained
box-level or fine-grained panoptic pixel-level VidSGG, often requiring
task-specific architectures and multi-stage training pipelines. In this paper,
we present UNO (UNified Object-centric VidSGG), a single-stage, unified
framework that jointly addresses both tasks within an end-to-end architecture.
UNO is designed to minimize task-specific modifications and maximize parameter
sharing, enabling generalization across different levels of visual granularity.
The core of UNO is an extended slot attention mechanism that decomposes visual
features into object and relation slots. To ensure robust temporal modeling, we
introduce object temporal consistency learning, which enforces consistent
object representations across frames without relying on explicit tracking
modules. Additionally, a dynamic triplet prediction module links relation slots
to corresponding object pairs, capturing evolving interactions over time. We
evaluate UNO on standard box-level and pixel-level VidSGG benchmarks. Results
demonstrate that UNO not only achieves competitive performance across both
tasks but also offers improved efficiency through a unified, object-centric
design.

Abstract: Bone fractures present a major global health challenge, often resulting in
pain, reduced mobility, and productivity loss, particularly in low-resource
settings where access to expert radiology services is limited. Conventional
imaging methods suffer from high costs, radiation exposure, and dependency on
specialized interpretation. To address this, we developed an AI-based solution
for automated fracture detection from X-ray images using a custom Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) and benchmarked it against transfer learning models
including EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, and ResNet50. Training was conducted on
the publicly available FracAtlas dataset, comprising 4,083 anonymized
musculoskeletal radiographs. The custom CNN achieved 95.96% accuracy, 0.94
precision, 0.88 recall, and an F1-score of 0.91 on the FracAtlas dataset.
Although transfer learning models (EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, ResNet50)
performed poorly in this specific setup, these results should be interpreted in
light of class imbalance and data set limitations. This work highlights the
promise of lightweight CNNs for detecting fractures in X-rays and underscores
the importance of fair benchmarking, diverse datasets, and external validation
for clinical translation

Abstract: Object Recognition and Document Skew Estimation have come a long way in terms
of performance and efficiency. New models follow one of two directions:
improving performance using larger models, and improving efficiency using
smaller models. However, real-time document detection and rectification is a
niche that is largely unexplored by the literature, yet it remains a vital step
for automatic information retrieval from visual documents. In this work, we
strive towards an efficient document detection pipeline that is satisfactory in
terms of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) retrieval and faster than other
available solutions. We adapt IWPOD-Net, a license plate detection network, and
train it for detection on NBID, a synthetic ID card dataset. We experiment with
data augmentation and cross-dataset validation with MIDV (another synthetic ID
and passport document dataset) to find the optimal scenario for the model.
Other methods from both the Object Recognition and Skew Estimation
state-of-the-art are evaluated for comparison with our approach. We use each
method to detect and rectify the document, which is then read by an OCR system.
The OCR output is then evaluated using a novel OCR quality metric based on the
Levenshtein distance. Since the end goal is to improve automatic information
retrieval, we use the overall OCR quality as a performance metric. We observe
that with a promising model, document rectification does not have to be perfect
to attain state-of-the-art performance scores. We show that our model is
smaller and more efficient than current state-of-the-art solutions while
retaining a competitive OCR quality metric. All code is available at

Abstract: Understanding 3D spatial relationships remains a major limitation of current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior work has addressed this issue by creating
spatial question-answering (QA) datasets based on single images or indoor
videos. However, real-world embodied AI agents such as robots and self-driving
cars typically rely on ego-centric, multi-view observations. To this end, we
introduce Ego3D-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial
reasoning abilities of VLMs using ego-centric, multi-view outdoor data.
Ego3D-Bench comprises over 8,600 QA pairs, created with significant involvement
from human annotators to ensure quality and diversity. We benchmark 16 SOTA
VLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini1.5-Pro, InternVL3, and Qwen2.5-VL. Our results
reveal a notable performance gap between human level scores and VLM
performance, highlighting that current VLMs still fall short of human level
spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose Ego3D-VLM, a
post-training framework that enhances 3D spatial reasoning of VLMs. Ego3D-VLM
generates cognitive map based on estimated global 3D coordinates, resulting in
12% average improvement on multi-choice QA and 56% average improvement on
absolute distance estimation. Ego3D-VLM is modular and can be integrated with
any existing VLM. Together, Ego3D-Bench and Ego3D-VLM offer valuable tools for
advancing toward human level spatial understanding in real-world, multi-view
environments.

TL;DR: 通过智能手机自拍图片远程估算皮肤保水度和经皮失水量，提出了一种新的皮肤先验适配视觉Transformer模型，解决了皮肤健康监测的普及性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤保水度(SH)和经皮失水量(TEWL)是重要的皮肤障碍功能指标，但传统测量需要专业仪器和到医院完成，普通用户难以获得。需要一种方便的远程测量方案。

Method: 提出了一个系统性解决方案，包括SH/TEWL数据收集、数据预处理，以及一种新的Skin-Prior Adaptive Vision Transformer模型。识别了数据标注不平衡问题，并提出对称基对比正则化方法来减少模型偏差。

Result: 成功开发了从自拍面部图像远程估算SH和TEWL的方法，无需物理测量仪器。该方法有效减少了数据不平衡导致的模型偏差。

Conclusion: 这是首个从自拍面部图像进行皮肤评估的研究，平桥了计算机视觉与护肤研究之间的间隔，为AI驱动的普及化皮肤分析开启了新可能。

Abstract: Skin health and disease resistance are closely linked to the skin barrier
function, which protects against environmental factors and water loss. Two key
physiological indicators can quantitatively represent this barrier function:
skin hydration (SH) and trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL). Measurement of SH
and TEWL is valuable for the public to monitor skin conditions regularly,
diagnose dermatological issues, and personalize their skincare regimens.
However, these measurements are not easily accessible to general users unless
they visit a dermatology clinic with specialized instruments. To tackle this
problem, we propose a systematic solution to estimate SH and TEWL from selfie
facial images remotely with smartphones. Our solution encompasses multiple
stages, including SH/TEWL data collection, data preprocessing, and formulating
a novel Skin-Prior Adaptive Vision Transformer model for SH/TEWL regression.
Through experiments, we identified the annotation imbalance of the SH/TEWL data
and proposed a symmetric-based contrastive regularization to reduce the model
bias due to the imbalance effectively. This work is the first study to explore
skin assessment from selfie facial images without physical measurements. It
bridges the gap between computer vision and skin care research, enabling
AI-driven accessible skin analysis for broader real-world applications.

TL;DR: PAML框架通过原型感知多模态学习解决视觉定位在开放词汇场景中的挑战，在标准场景表现优异，在开放词汇场景达到SOTA


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于transformer的方法在标准场景中定位性能良好，但在开放词汇场景（包含新物体类别）中存在三大限制：视觉-语言模态对齐不完美、跨模态特征融合不足、语义原型信息利用不充分

Method: 提出PAML框架：1)使用ALBEF进行初始跨模态对齐；2)视觉判别特征编码器增强显著对象表示；3)原型发现和继承机制提取聚合多邻居语义原型；4)多阶段解码器进行综合多模态整合

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的广泛实验验证了该方法，在标准场景中表现具有竞争力，在开放词汇场景中达到最先进水平

Conclusion: PAML框架通过系统解决跨模态对齐、特征融合和原型利用问题，显著提升了开放词汇视觉定位的性能

Abstract: Visual Grounding (VG) aims to utilize given natural language queries to
locate specific target objects within images. While current transformer-based
approaches demonstrate strong localization performance in standard scene (i.e,
scenarios without any novel objects), they exhibit notable limitations in
open-vocabulary scene (i.e, both familiar and novel object categories during
testing). These limitations primarily stem from three key factors: (1)
imperfect alignment between visual and linguistic modalities, (2) insufficient
cross-modal feature fusion, and (3) ineffective utilization of semantic
prototype information. To overcome these challenges, we present Prototype-Aware
Multimodal Learning (PAML), an innovative framework that systematically
addresses these issues through several key components: First, we leverage ALBEF
to establish robust cross-modal alignment during initial feature encoding.
Subsequently, our Visual Discriminative Feature Encoder selectively enhances
salient object representations while suppressing irrelevant visual context. The
framework then incorporates a novel prototype discovering and inheriting
mechanism that extracts and aggregates multi-neighbor semantic prototypes to
facilitate open-vocabulary recognition. These enriched features undergo
comprehensive multimodal integration through our Multi-stage Decoder before
final bounding box regression. Extensive experiments across five benchmark
datasets validate our approach, showing competitive performance in standard
scene while achieving state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary scene. Our
code is available at https://github.com/plankXie/PAML.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了视频领域的广义分类发现(Video-GCD)问题，设计了一种新的内存引导一致性感知对比学习框架(MCCL)，通过时空线索和全局上下文提升视频新类别发现的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GCD方法主要关注静态图像，但仅靠静态视觉内容不能可靠地发现新类别。需要将GCD扩展到视频领域，利用时间维度信息来提升发现能力。

Method: 提出MCCL框架，包含两个核心组件：一致性感知对比学习(CACL)利用多视角时间特征估计一致性得分，并用于加权对比损失；内存引导表征增强(MGRE)通过双层内存缓冲区维护特征级和逻辑级表征，提供全局上下文。两者形成互相增强的反馈循环。

Result: 在动作识别和鸟类分类视频数据集上进行了涉广实验，结果显示方法显著超过了来自图像基础设置的竞争方法，证明了时间信息对视频新类别发现的重要性。

Conclusion: 该研究成功将GCD扩展到视频领域，提出的MCCL框架通过有效整合时空线索和全局上下文，显著提升了视频新类别发现的性能，为开放世界视频分析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an emerging and challenging
open-world problem that has garnered increasing attention in recent years. Most
existing GCD methods focus on discovering categories in static images. However,
relying solely on static visual content is often insufficient to reliably
discover novel categories. To bridge this gap, we extend the GCD problem to the
video domain and introduce a new setting, termed Video-GCD. Thus, effectively
integrating multi-perspective information across time is crucial for accurate
Video-GCD. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel Memory-guided
Consistency-aware Contrastive Learning (MCCL) framework, which explicitly
captures temporal-spatial cues and incorporates them into contrastive learning
through a consistency-guided voting mechanism. MCCL consists of two core
components: Consistency-Aware Contrastive Learning(CACL) and Memory-Guided
Representation Enhancement (MGRE). CACL exploits multiperspective temporal
features to estimate consistency scores between unlabeled instances, which are
then used to weight the contrastive loss accordingly. MGRE introduces a
dual-level memory buffer that maintains both feature-level and logit-level
representations, providing global context to enhance intra-class compactness
and inter-class separability. This in turn refines the consistency estimation
in CACL, forming a mutually reinforcing feedback loop between representation
learning and consistency modeling. To facilitate a comprehensive evaluation, we
construct a new and challenging Video-GCD benchmark, which includes action
recognition and bird classification video datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms competitive GCD
approaches adapted from image-based settings, highlighting the importance of
temporal information for discovering novel categories in videos. The code will
be publicly available.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中表现出色，但如何有效整合图像分割仍是一个重大挑战，需要简化分割过程并提高效率

Method: 提出语义描述符作为分割掩码的文本表示，包括图像级和框级语义描述符；引入行级游程编码(R-RLE)压缩冗余文本；将分割建模为下一个砖块预测任务

Conclusion: 该工作展示了在MLLM框架内文本驱动图像分割的有效性、可扩展性和泛化能力，为简化分割流程提供了新思路

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities
in vision-language tasks. However, effectively integrating image segmentation
into these models remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a
novel text-as-mask paradigm that casts image segmentation as a text generation
problem, eliminating the need for additional decoders and significantly
simplifying the segmentation process. Our key innovation is semantic
descriptors, a new textual representation of segmentation masks where each
image patch is mapped to its corresponding text label. We first introduce
image-wise semantic descriptors, a patch-aligned textual representation of
segmentation masks that integrates naturally into the language modeling
pipeline. To enhance efficiency, we introduce the Row-wise Run-Length Encoding
(R-RLE), which compresses redundant text sequences, reducing the length of
semantic descriptors by 74% and accelerating inference by $3\times$, without
compromising performance. Building upon this, our initial framework Text4Seg
achieves strong segmentation performance across a wide range of vision tasks.
To further improve granularity and compactness, we propose box-wise semantic
descriptors, which localizes regions of interest using bounding boxes and
represents region masks via structured mask tokens called semantic bricks. This
leads to our refined model, Text4Seg++, which formulates segmentation as a
next-brick prediction task, combining precision, scalability, and generative
efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on natural and remote sensing datasets
show that Text4Seg++ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models across
diverse benchmarks without any task-specific fine-tuning, while remaining
compatible with existing MLLM backbones. Our work highlights the effectiveness,
scalability, and generalizability of text-driven image segmentation within the
MLLM framework.

Abstract: The precise characterization of plant morphology provides valuable insights
into plant environment interactions and genetic evolution. A key technology for
extracting this information is 3D segmentation, which delineates individual
plant organs from complex point clouds. Despite significant progress in general
3D computer vision domains, the adoption of 3D segmentation for plant
phenotyping remains limited by three major challenges: i) the scarcity of
large-scale annotated datasets, ii) technical difficulties in adapting advanced
deep neural networks to plant point clouds, and iii) the lack of standardized
benchmarks and evaluation protocols tailored to plant science. This review
systematically addresses these barriers by: i) providing an overview of
existing 3D plant datasets in the context of general 3D segmentation domains,
ii) systematically summarizing deep learning-based methods for point cloud
semantic and instance segmentation, iii) introducing Plant Segmentation Studio
(PSS), an open-source framework for reproducible benchmarking, and iv)
conducting extensive quantitative experiments to evaluate representative
networks and sim-to-real learning strategies. Our findings highlight the
efficacy of sparse convolutional backbones and transformer-based instance
segmentation, while also emphasizing the complementary role of modeling-based
and augmentation-based synthetic data generation for sim-to-real learning in
reducing annotation demands. In general, this study bridges the gap between
algorithmic advances and practical deployment, providing immediate tools for
researchers and a roadmap for developing data-efficient and generalizable deep
learning solutions in 3D plant phenotyping. Data and code are available at

Abstract: Currency recognition systems often overlook usability and authenticity
assessment, especially in low-resource environments where visually impaired
users and offline validation are common. While existing methods focus on
denomination classification, they typically ignore physical degradation and
forgery, limiting their applicability in real-world conditions. This paper
presents a unified framework for currency evaluation that integrates three
modules: denomination classification using lightweight CNN models, damage
quantification through a novel Unified Currency Damage Index (UCDI), and
counterfeit detection using feature-based template matching. The dataset
consists of over 82,000 annotated images spanning clean, damaged, and
counterfeit notes. Our Custom_CNN model achieves high classification
performance with low parameter count. The UCDI metric provides a continuous
usability score based on binary mask loss, chromatic distortion, and structural
feature loss. The counterfeit detection module demonstrates reliable
identification of forged notes across varied imaging conditions. The framework
supports real-time, on-device inference and addresses key deployment challenges
in constrained environments. Results show that accurate, interpretable, and
compact solutions can support inclusive currency evaluation in practical
settings.

paper presents a multimodal detection framework that integrates RGB and thermal
infrared imaging with a fine-tuned YOLOv8 model. Training leveraged KITTI,
BDD100K, and Teledyne FLIR datasets, with class re-weighting and light
augmentations to improve minority-class performance and robustness, experiments
show that 640-pixel resolution and partial backbone freezing optimise accuracy

Motivation: 时间敏感视频理解任务可以从帧内基础物体中获益，但传统的文本描述方式会导致令牌长度增加和对物体信息噪声敏感

Method: 设计GO-Tokenizer模块，利用现有物体检测器动态编码紧凑的物体信息，作为Video-LLMs的轻量附加组件

Result: 使用GO-Tokenizer预训练的模型在性能上超过原始Video-LLM和使用文本描述的对照组，在多个模型、数据集和视频理解任务上都发现了普遍提升

Conclusion: GO-Tokenizer提供了一种高效的方法来将基础物体信息整合到视频大语言模型中，显著提升了时间敏感视频理解能力而不会导致令牌压力或噪声问题

Abstract: We propose to improve the time-sensitive video understanding (TSV) capability
of video large language models (Video-LLMs) with grounded objects (GO). We
hypothesize that TSV tasks can benefit from GO within frames, which is
supported by our preliminary experiments on LITA, a state-of-the-art Video-LLM
for reasoning temporal localization. While augmenting prompts with textual
description of these object annotations improves the performance of LITA, it
also introduces extra token length and susceptibility to the noise in object
level information. To address this, we propose GO-Tokenizer, a lightweight
add-on module for Video-LLMs leveraging off-the-shelf object detectors to
encode compact object information on the fly. Experimental results demonstrate
that pretraining with GO-Tokenizer outperforms the vanilla Video-LLM and its
counterpart utilizing textual description of objects in the prompt. The gain
generalizes across different models, datasets and video understanding tasks
such as reasoning temporal localization and dense captioning.

Conclusion: MVP-FAS通过多文本表示和补丁对齐机制，有效提升了面部防欺骗的跨域泛化能力

Abstract: Recent face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods have shown remarkable cross-domain
performance by employing vision-language models like CLIP. However, existing
CLIP-based FAS models do not fully exploit CLIP's patch embedding tokens,
failing to detect critical spoofing clues. Moreover, these models rely on a
single text prompt per class (e.g., 'live' or 'fake'), which limits
generalization. To address these issues, we propose MVP-FAS, a novel framework
incorporating two key modules: Multi-View Slot attention (MVS) and Multi-Text
Patch Alignment (MTPA). Both modules utilize multiple paraphrased texts to
generate generalized features and reduce dependence on domain-specific text.
MVS extracts local detailed spatial features and global context from patch
embeddings by leveraging diverse texts with multiple perspectives. MTPA aligns
patches with multiple text representations to improve semantic robustness.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVP-FAS achieves superior generalization
performance, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on cross-domain
datasets. Code: https://github.com/Elune001/MVP-FAS.

Abstract: Colorectal diseases, including inflammatory conditions and neoplasms, require
quick, accurate care to be effectively treated. Traditional diagnostic
pipelines require extensive preparation and rely on separate, individual
evaluations on histological images and colonoscopy footage, introducing
possible variability and inefficiencies. This pilot study proposes a unified
deep learning network that uses convolutional neural networks (CN N s) to
classify both histopathological slides and colonoscopy video frames in one
pipeline. The pipeline integrates class-balancing learning, robust
augmentation, and calibration methods to ensure accurate results. Static colon
histology images were taken from the PathMNIST dataset, and the lower
gastrointestinal (colonoscopy) videos were drawn from the HyperKvasir dataset.
The CNN architecture used was ResNet-50. This study demonstrates an
interpretable and reproducible diagnostic pipeline that unifies multiple

Abstract: Drought stress is a major threat to global crop productivity, making its
early and precise detection essential for sustainable agricultural management.
Traditional approaches, though useful, are often time-consuming and
labor-intensive, which has motivated the adoption of deep learning methods. In
recent years, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer
architectures have been widely explored for drought stress identification;
however, these models generally rely on a large number of trainable parameters,
restricting their use in resource-limited and real-time agricultural settings.
To address this challenge, we propose a novel lightweight hybrid CNN framework
inspired by ResNet, DenseNet, and MobileNet architectures. The framework
achieves a remarkable 15-fold reduction in trainable parameters compared to
conventional CNN and Vision Transformer models, while maintaining competitive
accuracy. In addition, we introduce a machine unlearning mechanism based on a
gradient norm-based influence function, which enables targeted removal of
specific training data influence, thereby improving model adaptability. The
method was evaluated on an aerial image dataset of potato fields with
expert-annotated healthy and drought-stressed regions. Experimental results
show that our framework achieves high accuracy while substantially lowering
computational costs. These findings highlight its potential as a practical,
scalable, and adaptive solution for drought stress monitoring in precision
agriculture, particularly under resource-constrained conditions.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR),

integrates seamlessly into multiple state-of-the-art SR backbones (e.g., SCNet,
HiT-SR, OverNet), delivering competitive or superior performance across a wide

benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach enables robust multi-scale
upscaling with minimal computational overhead, offering a practical solution
for real-world scenarios.

represents an intractable workload for clinicians. As a result, follow-up
images are not annotated and merely assessed by observation. Response to
treatment in longitudinal imaging is being studied, to better understand growth
trajectories and ultimately predict treatment success or toxicity as early as
possible. In this study, we implement an automated pipeline to curate a large
longitudinal dataset of SRS treatment data, resulting in a cohort of 896 BMs in
177 patients who were monitored for >360 days at approximately two-month
intervals at Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV). We use a data-driven
clustering to identify characteristic trajectories. In addition, we predict 12
months lesion-level response using classical as well as graph machine learning
Graph Machine Learning (GML). Clustering revealed 5 dominant growth
trajectories with distinct final response categories. Response prediction
reaches up to 0.90 AUC (CI95%=0.88-0.92) using only pre-treatment and first
follow-up MRI with gradient boosting. Similarly, robust predictive performance
of up to 0.88 AUC (CI95%=0.86-0.90) was obtained using GML, offering more
flexibility with a single model for multiple input time-points configurations.
Our results suggest potential automation and increased precision for the
comprehensive assessment and prediction of BM response to SRS in longitudinal
MRI. The proposed pipeline facilitates scalable data curation for the
investigation of BM growth patterns, and lays the foundation for clinical
decision support systems aiming at optimizing personalized care.

*Matthieu Gendrin,Stéphane Pateux,Théo Ladune*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文针对3D高斯泼溅在大型场景中的3DoF+限制问题，提出了基于球坐标的量化方案来减少位置误差对投影误差的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS在大型场景中由于输入视图采集位置有限，导致重建仅适用于有限视角范围（3DoF+），需要解决坐标量化带来的位置误差问题。

Method: 研究位置误差对投影误差的影响，发现投影误差与投影点距离的平方倒数成正比，据此提出基于球坐标的新型量化方案。

Result: 在著名的Garden场景上展示了所提方法的率失真性能。

Conclusion: 提出的球坐标量化方案能有效处理3DGS在3DoF+场景中的坐标量化问题，改善投影精度。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a major breakthrough in 3D scene
reconstruction. With a number of views of a given object or scene, the
algorithm trains a model composed of 3D gaussians, which enables the production
of novel views from arbitrary points of view. This freedom of movement is
referred to as 6DoF for 6 degrees of freedom: a view is produced for any
position (3 degrees), orientation of camera (3 other degrees). On large scenes,
though, the input views are acquired from a limited zone in space, and the
reconstruction is valuable for novel views from the same zone, even if the
scene itself is almost unlimited in size. We refer to this particular case as
3DoF+, meaning that the 3 degrees of freedom of camera position are limited to
small offsets around the central position. Considering the problem of
coordinate quantization, the impact of position error on the projection error
in pixels is studied. It is shown that the projection error is proportional to
the squared inverse distance of the point being projected. Consequently, a new
quantization scheme based on spherical coordinates is proposed. Rate-distortion
performance of the proposed method are illustrated on the well-known Garden
scene.

Abstract: Video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) is challenging due to dynamic
environments. Existing methods face two main issues: (1) SAM-based methods
struggle to separate camouflaged object edges due to model freezing, and (2)
MLLM-based methods suffer from poor object separability as large language
models merge foreground and background. To address these issues, we propose a
novel VCOD method based on SAM and MLLM, called Phantom-Insight. To enhance the
separability of object edge details, we represent video sequences with temporal
and spatial clues and perform feature fusion via LLM to increase information
density. Next, multiple cues are generated through the dynamic foreground
visual token scoring module and the prompt network to adaptively guide and
fine-tune the SAM model, enabling it to adapt to subtle textures. To enhance
the separability of objects and background, we propose a decoupled
foreground-background learning strategy. By generating foreground and
background cues separately and performing decoupled training, the visual token
can effectively integrate foreground and background information independently,
enabling SAM to more accurately segment camouflaged objects in the video.
Experiments on the MoCA-Mask dataset show that Phantom-Insight achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various metrics. Additionally, its ability
to detect unseen camouflaged objects on the CAD2016 dataset highlights its
strong generalization ability.

Abstract: Muzzle patterns are among the most effective biometric traits for cattle
identification. Fast and accurate detection of the muzzle region as the region
of interest is critical to automatic visual cattle identification.. Earlier
approaches relied on manual detection, which is labor-intensive and
inconsistent. Recently, automated methods using supervised models like YOLO
have become popular for muzzle detection. Although effective, these methods
require extensive annotated datasets and tend to be trained data-dependent,
limiting their performance on new or unseen cattle. To address these
limitations, this study proposes a zero-shot muzzle detection framework based
on Grounding DINO, a vision-language model capable of detecting muzzles without
any task-specific training or annotated data. This approach leverages natural
language prompts to guide detection, enabling scalable and flexible muzzle
localization across diverse breeds and environments. Our model achieves a mean
Average Precision (mAP)@0.5 of 76.8\%, demonstrating promising performance
without requiring annotated data. To our knowledge, this is the first research
to provide a real-world, industry-oriented, and annotation-free solution for
cattle muzzle detection. The framework offers a practical alternative to
supervised methods, promising improved adaptability and ease of deployment in
livestock monitoring applications.

Conclusion: 提出的PBAN方法通过模拟人类视觉系统的特性，能够有效评估超分辨率图像质量，为SR算法比较提供了更好的评估工具

Abstract: Many super-resolution (SR) algorithms have been proposed to increase image
resolution. However, full-reference (FR) image quality assessment (IQA) metrics
for comparing and evaluating different SR algorithms are limited. In this work,
we propose the Perception-oriented Bidirectional Attention Network (PBAN) for
image SR FR-IQA, which is composed of three modules: an image encoder module, a
perception-oriented bidirectional attention (PBA) module, and a quality
prediction module. First, we encode the input images for feature
representations. Inspired by the characteristics of the human visual system, we
then construct the perception-oriented PBA module. Specifically, different from
existing attention-based SR IQA methods, we conceive a Bidirectional Attention
to bidirectionally construct visual attention to distortion, which is
consistent with the generation and evaluation processes of SR images. To
further guide the quality assessment towards the perception of distorted
information, we propose Grouped Multi-scale Deformable Convolution, enabling
the proposed method to adaptively perceive distortion. Moreover, we design
Sub-information Excitation Convolution to direct visual perception to both
sub-pixel and sub-channel attention. Finally, the quality prediction module is
exploited to integrate quality-aware features and regress quality scores.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed PBAN outperforms
state-of-the-art quality assessment methods.

Abstract: Cross-source point cloud registration, which aims to align point cloud data
from different sensors, is a fundamental task in 3D vision. However, compared
to the same-source point cloud registration, cross-source registration faces
two core challenges: the lack of publicly available large-scale real-world
datasets for training the deep registration models, and the inherent
differences in point clouds captured by multiple sensors. The diverse patterns
induced by the sensors pose great challenges in robust and accurate point cloud
feature extraction and matching, which negatively influence the registration
accuracy. To advance research in this field, we construct Cross3DReg, the
currently largest and real-world multi-modal cross-source point cloud
registration dataset, which is collected by a rotating mechanical lidar and a
hybrid semi-solid-state lidar, respectively. Moreover, we design an
overlap-based cross-source registration framework, which utilizes unaligned
images to predict the overlapping region between source and target point
clouds, effectively filtering out redundant points in the irrelevant regions
and significantly mitigating the interference caused by noise in
non-overlapping areas. Then, a visual-geometric attention guided matching
module is proposed to enhance the consistency of cross-source point cloud
features by fusing image and geometric information to establish reliable
correspondences and ultimately achieve accurate and robust registration.
Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
registration performance. Our framework reduces the relative rotation error
(RRE) and relative translation error (RTE) by $63.2\%$ and $40.2\%$,
respectively, and improves the registration recall (RR) by $5.4\%$, which
validates its effectiveness in achieving accurate cross-source registration.

Abstract: Deep neural networks currently dominate many fields of the artificial
intelligence landscape, achieving state-of-the-art results on numerous tasks
while remaining hard to understand and exhibiting surprising weaknesses. An
active area of research focuses on adversarial attacks, which aim to generate
inputs that uncover these weaknesses. However, this proves challenging,
especially in the black-box scenario where model details are inaccessible. This
paper explores in detail the impact of such adversarial algorithms on
ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, Swin Transformer V2, and Vision Transformer network
architectures. Leveraging the Tiny ImageNet, Caltech-256, and Food-101
datasets, we benchmark two novel black-box iterative adversarial algorithms
based on affine transformations and genetic algorithms: 1) Affine
Transformation Attack (ATA), an iterative algorithm maximizing our attack score
function using random affine transformations, and 2) Affine Genetic Attack
(AGA), a genetic algorithm that involves random noise and affine
transformations. We evaluate the performance of the models in the algorithm
parameter variation, data augmentation, and global and targeted attack
configurations. We also compare our algorithms with two black-box adversarial
algorithms, Pixle and Square Attack. Our experiments yield better results on
the image classification task than similar methods in the literature, achieving
an accuracy improvement of up to 8.82%. We provide noteworthy insights into
successful adversarial defenses and attacks at both global and targeted levels,
and demonstrate adversarial robustness through algorithm parameter variation.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在复杂视觉环境中性能下降，现有增强方法需要额外训练或外部工具，忽视了模型内在的注意力机制能力

Result: 实验表明CARVE能持续提升性能，在开源模型上实现高达75%的改进

Conclusion: 研究揭示了视觉复杂度与注意力机制的相互作用，为通过对比注意力改善视觉推理提供了有效途径

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across
diverse visual tasks, yet their performance degrades in complex visual
environments. While existing enhancement approaches require additional
training, rely on external segmentation tools, or operate at coarse-grained
levels, they overlook the innate ability within VLMs. To bridge this gap, we
investigate VLMs' attention patterns and discover that: (1) visual complexity
strongly correlates with attention entropy, negatively impacting reasoning
performance; (2) attention progressively refines from global scanning in
shallow layers to focused convergence in deeper layers, with convergence degree
determined by visual complexity. (3) Theoretically, we prove that the contrast
of attention maps between general queries and task-specific queries enables the
decomposition of visual signal into semantic signals and visual noise
components. Building on these insights, we propose Contrastive Attention
Refinement for Visual Enhancement (CARVE), a training-free method that extracts
task-relevant visual signals through attention contrasting at the pixel level.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CARVE consistently enhances performance,
achieving up to 75% improvement on open-source models. Our work provides
critical insights into the interplay between visual complexity and attention
mechanisms, offering an efficient pathway for improving visual reasoning with
contrasting attention.

Abstract: Realistic and parameterized 3D models of human anatomy have become invaluable
in research, diagnostics, and surgical planning. However, the development of
detailed models for internal organs, such as the stomach, has been limited by
data availability and methodological challenges. In this paper, we propose a
novel pipeline for the generation of synthetic 3D stomach models, enabling the
creation of anatomically diverse morphologies informed by established studies
on stomach shape variability. Using this pipeline, we construct a dataset of
synthetic stomachs. Building on this dataset, we develop a 3D statistical shape
model of the stomach, trained to capture natural anatomical variability in a
low-dimensional shape space. The model is further refined using CT meshes
derived from publicly available datasets through a semi-supervised alignment
process, enhancing its ability to generalize to unseen anatomical variations.
We evaluated the model on a held-out test set of real stomach CT scans,
demonstrating robust generalization and fit accuracy. We make the statistical
shape model along with the synthetic dataset publicly available on GitLab:
https://gitlab.com/Erez.Posner/stomach_pytorch to facilitate further research.
This work introduces the first statistical 3D shape model of the stomach, with
applications ranging from surgical simulation and pre-operative planning to
medical education and computational modeling. By combining synthetic data
generation, parametric modeling, and real-world validation, our approach
represents a significant advancement in organ modeling and opens new

Abstract: The advent of large-scale vision foundation models, pre-trained on diverse
natural images, has marked a paradigm shift in computer vision. However, how
the frontier vision foundation models' efficacies transfer to specialized
domains remains such as medical imaging remains an open question. This report
investigates whether DINOv3, a state-of-the-art self-supervised vision
transformer (ViT) that features strong capability in dense prediction tasks,
can directly serve as a powerful, unified encoder for medical vision tasks
without domain-specific pre-training. To answer this, we benchmark DINOv3
across common medical vision tasks, including 2D/3D classification and
segmentation on a wide range of medical imaging modalities. We systematically
analyze its scalability by varying model sizes and input image resolutions. Our
findings reveal that DINOv3 shows impressive performance and establishes a
formidable new baseline. Remarkably, it can even outperform medical-specific
foundation models like BiomedCLIP and CT-Net on several tasks, despite being
trained solely on natural images. However, we identify clear limitations: The
model's features degrade in scenarios requiring deep domain specialization,
such as in Whole-Slide Pathological Images (WSIs), Electron Microscopy (EM),
and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Furthermore, we observe that DINOv3
does not consistently obey scaling law in the medical domain; performance does
not reliably increase with larger models or finer feature resolutions, showing
diverse scaling behaviors across tasks. Ultimately, our work establishes DINOv3
as a strong baseline, whose powerful visual features can serve as a robust
prior for multiple complex medical tasks. This opens promising future
directions, such as leveraging its features to enforce multiview consistency in
3D reconstruction.

Conclusion: FSG-Net通过频率-空间协同处理有效解决了变化检测中的伪变化问题和特征融合难题，为遥感图像分析提供了新的有效方法

Abstract: Change detection from high-resolution remote sensing images lies as a
cornerstone of Earth observation applications, yet its efficacy is often
compromised by two critical challenges. First, false alarms are prevalent as
models misinterpret radiometric variations from temporal shifts (e.g.,
illumination, season) as genuine changes. Second, a non-negligible semantic gap
between deep abstract features and shallow detail-rich features tends to
obstruct their effective fusion, culminating in poorly delineated boundaries.
To step further in addressing these issues, we propose the Frequency-Spatial
Synergistic Gated Network (FSG-Net), a novel paradigm that aims to
systematically disentangle semantic changes from nuisance variations.
Specifically, FSG-Net first operates in the frequency domain, where a
Discrepancy-Aware Wavelet Interaction Module (DAWIM) adaptively mitigates
pseudo-changes by discerningly processing different frequency components.
Subsequently, the refined features are enhanced in the spatial domain by a
Synergistic Temporal-Spatial Attention Module (STSAM), which amplifies the
saliency of genuine change regions. To finally bridge the semantic gap, a
Lightweight Gated Fusion Unit (LGFU) leverages high-level semantics to
selectively gate and integrate crucial details from shallow layers.
Comprehensive experiments on the CDD, GZ-CD, and LEVIR-CD benchmarks validate
the superiority of FSG-Net, establishing a new state-of-the-art with F1-scores
of 94.16%, 89.51%, and 91.27%, respectively. The code will be made available at
https://github.com/zxXie-Air/FSG-Net after a possible publication.

potential in accurately identifying and segmenting unwanted items in such
settings. Unfortunately, considering the multitude and the variety of sorting
tasks, fully supervised approaches are not a viable option to address this
challange, as they require extensive labeling efforts. Surprisingly, weakly
supervised alternatives that leverage the implicit supervision naturally
provided by the operator in his removal action are relatively unexplored. In
this paper, we define the concept of Before-After Supervision, illustrating how
to train a segmentation network by leveraging only the visual differences
between images acquired \textit{before} and \textit{after} the operator. To
promote research in this direction, we introduce WS$^2$ (Weakly Supervised
segmentation for Waste-Sorting), the first multiview dataset consisting of more
than 11 000 high-resolution video frames captured on top of a conveyor belt,
including "before" and "after" images. We also present a robust end-to-end
pipeline, used to benchmark several state-of-the-art weakly supervised
segmentation methods on WS$^2$.

TL;DR: TIDE框架通过目标监督和偏好学习解决主题驱动图像生成中身份保持与指令遵循的平衡问题，无需测试时微调即可实现优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在主题驱动图像生成中无法有效平衡主体身份保持和动态编辑指令遵循的紧张关系

Method: 提出目标监督三元组对齐方法，使用(参考图像,指令,目标图像)三元组建模主体适应动态，采用DSD目标函数训练模型

Result: 在标准基准测试中表现出色，在多个定量指标上优于基线方法，能够生成主体忠实且指令合规的输出

Conclusion: TIDE框架通过系统化的目标监督和偏好学习有效解决了主题驱动图像生成的核心挑战，具有广泛的适用性

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation (SDIG) aims to manipulate specific subjects
within images while adhering to textual instructions, a task crucial for
advancing text-to-image diffusion models. SDIG requires reconciling the tension
between maintaining subject identity and complying with dynamic edit
instructions, a challenge inadequately addressed by existing methods. In this
paper, we introduce the Target-Instructed Diffusion Enhancing (TIDE) framework,
which resolves this tension through target supervision and preference learning
without test-time fine-tuning. TIDE pioneers target-supervised triplet
alignment, modelling subject adaptation dynamics using a (reference image,
instruction, target images) triplet. This approach leverages the Direct Subject
Diffusion (DSD) objective, training the model with paired "winning" (balanced
preservation-compliance) and "losing" (distorted) targets, systematically
generated and evaluated via quantitative metrics. This enables implicit reward
modelling for optimal preservation-compliance balance. Experimental results on
standard benchmarks demonstrate TIDE's superior performance in generating
subject-faithful outputs while maintaining instruction compliance,
outperforming baseline methods across multiple quantitative metrics. TIDE's
versatility is further evidenced by its successful application to diverse
tasks, including structural-conditioned generation, image-to-image generation,
and text-image interpolation. Our code is available at

Motivation: 准确评估脑细胞癌对治疗的响应对临床决策至关重要，但现有RANO标准应用复杂且存在观察者变异性，需要自动化解决方案

Method: 提出新题混合框架，结合细调ResNet-18模型提取的深度特征与4800个政师学和临床特征，包括肿瘤增长/缩小指提、体积变化和肿瘤质心偏移，使用CatBoost分类器进行响应分类

Result: 在4类响应预测任务（完全响应、部分响应、病情稳定、病情进展）中，平均ROC AUC达到0.81，Macro F1分数为0.50

Conclusion: 学习到的图像表征与领域目标政师学特征的协同结合，为神经辐射学领域的自动化治疗响应评估提供了稳健有效的解决方案

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of the response of glioblastoma to therapy is crucial for
clinical decision-making and patient management. The Response Assessment in
Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria provide a standardized framework to assess
patients' clinical response, but their application can be complex and subject
to observer variability. This paper presents an automated method for
classifying the intervention response from longitudinal MRI scans, developed to
predict tumor response during therapy as part of the BraTS 2025 challenge. We
propose a novel hybrid framework that combines deep learning derived feature
extraction and an extensive set of radiomics and clinically chosen features.
Our approach utilizes a fine-tuned ResNet-18 model to extract features from 2D
regions of interest across four MRI modalities. These deep features are then
fused with a rich set of more than 4800 radiomic and clinically driven
features, including 3D radiomics of tumor growth and shrinkage masks,
volumetric changes relative to the nadir, and tumor centroid shift. Using the
fused feature set, a CatBoost classifier achieves a mean ROC AUC of 0.81 and a
Macro F1 score of 0.50 in the 4-class response prediction task (Complete
Response, Partial Response, Stable Disease, Progressive Disease). Our results
highlight that synergizing learned image representations with domain-targeted
radiomic features provides a robust and effective solution for automated
treatment response assessment in neuro-oncology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检验Luo等人(2024)提出的FairCLIP方法的可复现性，并研究其通过Sinkhorn距离最小化来改善CLIP模型组群公平性的方法是否有效

Method: 重现Luo等人的实验设置，发现原始实现与描述不一致后开发了A-FairCLIP对比研究，提出了支持多属性的FairCLIP+，并分析了距离最小化对公平性和性能的影响

Result: 证实了CLIP在医疗扫描图像和临床笔记的零样本青光眼分类中存在人口统计学偏见，但FairCLIP、A-FairCLIP和FairCLIP+在两个数据集上均未能显著改善性能或公平性，虽然Sinkhorn距离有所减小

Conclusion: 虽然FairCLIP的正则化目标能够减小Sinkhorn距离，但在实际应用中并未能有效提升CLIP模型在零样本分类任务中的公平性和性能表现

Abstract: We investigated the reproducibility of FairCLIP, proposed by Luo et al.
(2024), for improving the group fairness of CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) by
minimizing image-text similarity score disparities across sensitive groups
using the Sinkhorn distance. The experimental setup of Luo et al. (2024) was
reproduced to primarily investigate the research findings for FairCLIP. The
model description by Luo et al. (2024) was found to differ from the original
implementation. Therefore, a new implementation, A-FairCLIP, is introduced to
examine specific design choices. Furthermore, FairCLIP+ is proposed to extend
the FairCLIP objective to include multiple attributes. Additionally, the impact
of the distance minimization on FairCLIP's fairness and performance was
explored. In alignment with the original authors, CLIP was found to be biased
towards certain demographics when applied to zero-shot glaucoma classification
using medical scans and clinical notes from the Harvard-FairVLMed dataset.
However, the experimental results on two datasets do not support their claim
that FairCLIP improves the performance and fairness of CLIP. Although the
regularization objective reduces Sinkhorn distances, both the official
implementation and the aligned implementation, A-FairCLIP, were not found to
improve performance nor fairness in zero-shot glaucoma classification.

Abstract: Fast and tiny object tracking remains a challenge in computer vision and in
this paper we first introduce a JSON metadata file associated with four open
source datasets of Fast Moving Objects (FMOs) image sequences. In addition, we
extend the description of the FMOs datasets with additional ground truth
information in JSON format (called FMOX) with object size information. Finally
we use our FMOX file to test a recently proposed foundational model for
tracking (called EfficientTAM) showing that its performance compares well with
the pipelines originally taylored for these FMO datasets. Our comparison of
these state-of-the-art techniques on FMOX is provided with Trajectory
Intersection of Union (TIoU) scores. The code and JSON is shared open source
allowing FMOX to be accessible and usable for other machine learning pipelines

Motivation: 解决现有绘图图像检索模型对自由手绘绘图中存在的模糊性和噪声问题的敏感性，强调训练过程的设计重要性

Method: 组合使用预训练、适当的编码器结构和损失函数设计，专门设计了能够承受绘图变化的训练目标

Result: 在FS-COCO和SketchyCOCO这两个具有挑战性的数据集上达到了最先进的性能水平，而无需增加额外的模型复杂度

Conclusion: 训练设计在跨模态检索任务中具有关键作用，同时需要改进场景级绘图检索的评估场景

Abstract: The goal of Scene-level Sketch-Based Image Retrieval is to retrieve natural
images matching the overall semantics and spatial layout of a free-hand sketch.
Unlike prior work focused on architectural augmentations of retrieval models,
we emphasize the inherent ambiguity and noise present in real-world sketches.
This insight motivates a training objective that is explicitly designed to be
robust to sketch variability. We show that with an appropriate combination of
pre-training, encoder architecture, and loss formulation, it is possible to
achieve state-of-the-art performance without the introduction of additional
complexity. Extensive experiments on a challenging FS-COCO and widely-used
SketchyCOCO datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach and underline
the critical role of training design in cross-modal retrieval tasks, as well as
the need to improve the evaluation scenarios of scene-level SBIR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放集识别方法主要针对静态场景，无法适应连续数据流中不断出现新未知类别的增量学习场景，导致决策边界判别性难以维持和严重的类间混淆问题。

Method: 提出保持性角度表示学习(RARL)：1) 在等角紧框架下构建角度空间，使未知表示围绕非活跃原型对齐；2) 虚拟-内在交互(VII)训练策略，通过边界邻近虚拟类增强类间间隔；3) 分层校正策略缓解新旧类别和正负样本不平衡导致的表示偏差。

Result: 在CIFAR100和TinyImageNet数据集上进行了全面评估，建立了IOSR新基准，在各种任务设置下均达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: RARL方法有效解决了增量开放集识别中的表示漂移和决策边界退化问题，为动态环境下的开放集识别提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing open set recognition (OSR) methods are typically designed for static
scenarios, where models aim to classify known classes and identify unknown ones
within fixed scopes. This deviates from the expectation that the model should
incrementally identify newly emerging unknown classes from continuous data
streams and acquire corresponding knowledge. In such evolving scenarios, the
discriminability of OSR decision boundaries is hard to maintain due to
restricted access to former training data, causing severe inter-class
confusion. To solve this problem, we propose retentive angular representation
learning (RARL) for incremental open set recognition (IOSR). In RARL, unknown
representations are encouraged to align around inactive prototypes within an
angular space constructed under the equiangular tight frame, thereby mitigating
excessive representation drift during knowledge updates. Specifically, we adopt
a virtual-intrinsic interactive (VII) training strategy, which compacts known
representations by enforcing clear inter-class margins through
boundary-proximal virtual classes. Furthermore, a stratified rectification
strategy is designed to refine decision boundaries, mitigating representation
bias and feature space distortion caused by imbalances between old/new and
positive/negative class samples. We conduct thorough evaluations on CIFAR100
and TinyImageNet datasets and establish a new benchmark for IOSR. Experimental
results across various task setups demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多视角扩散模型大多采用非自回归形式，限制了视角数量的灵活性且推理速度较慢，无法很好地应用于世界建模任务。

Method: 使用因果掩码和逐帧噪声训练，采用成对相对相机位姿编码(CaPE)实现精确相机控制，推理时结合空间感知滑动窗口、键值缓存和噪声条件增强来减少漂移。

Result: 实验表明CausNVS支持广泛的相机轨迹，能够实现灵活的自回归新视角合成，并在多样化设置下保持一致的强视觉质量。

Conclusion: CausNVS通过自回归方法成功解决了多视角扩散模型在视角灵活性和推理效率方面的问题，为3D新视角合成提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-view diffusion models have shown promise in 3D novel view synthesis,
but most existing methods adopt a non-autoregressive formulation. This limits
their applicability in world modeling, as they only support a fixed number of
views and suffer from slow inference due to denoising all frames
simultaneously. To address these limitations, we propose CausNVS, a multi-view
diffusion model in an autoregressive setting, which supports arbitrary
input-output view configurations and generates views sequentially. We train
CausNVS with causal masking and per-frame noise, using pairwise-relative camera
pose encodings (CaPE) for precise camera control. At inference time, we combine
a spatially-aware sliding-window with key-value caching and noise conditioning
augmentation to mitigate drift. Our experiments demonstrate that CausNVS
supports a broad range of camera trajectories, enables flexible autoregressive
novel view synthesis, and achieves consistently strong visual quality across
diverse settings. Project page: https://kxhit.github.io/CausNVS.html.

Motivation: 随着数字市场和社交媒体中野生动物非法贸易日益猖獗，需要自动化方法来检测野生动物制品交易列表，特别是针对象牙等濒危物种产品的自动识别。

Method: 使用机器学习对象识别模型，训练数据包括被确认为非法销售或被当局没收的大象、穿山甲和老虎制品图像。研究了不同训练策略和损失函数的组合，为每个物种单独训练模型，同时开发了一个能识别所有三个物种产品的单一模型。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于网络贸易监控，还可用于实体市场的野生动物贸易监测，为政府当局和执法机构提供了实用的检测工具。

Abstract: Unsustainable trade in wildlife is a major threat to biodiversity and is now
increasingly prevalent in digital marketplaces and social media. With the sheer
volume of digital content, the need for automated methods to detect wildlife
trade listings is growing. These methods are especially needed for the
automatic identification of wildlife products, such as ivory. We developed
machine learning-based object recognition models that can identify wildlife
products within images and highlight them. The data consists of images of
elephant, pangolin, and tiger products that were identified as being sold
illegally or that were confiscated by authorities. Specifically, the wildlife
products included elephant ivory and skins, pangolin scales, and claws (raw and
crafted), and tiger skins and bones. We investigated various combinations of
training strategies and two loss functions to identify the best model to use in
the automatic detection of these wildlife products. Models were trained for
each species while also developing a single model to identify products from all
three species. The best model showed an overall accuracy of 84.2% with
accuracies of 71.1%, 90.2% and 93.5% in detecting products derived from
elephants, pangolins, and tigers, respectively. We further demonstrate that the
machine learning model can be made easily available to stakeholders, such as
government authorities and law enforcement agencies, by developing a
smartphone-based application that had an overall accuracy of 91.3%. The
application can be used in real time to click images and help identify
potentially prohibited products of target species. Thus, the proposed method is
not only applicable for monitoring trade on the web but can also be used e.g.
in physical markets for monitoring wildlife trade.

Motivation: 低剂量CT和PET虽然减少了辐射暴露，但会导致噪声和伪影增加，影响诊断准确性，需要有效的去噪方法

Method: 提出混合Swin注意力网络(HSANet)，包含高效全局注意力(EGA)模块增强空间和通道交互，以及混合上采样模块防止噪声过拟合

Result: 在公开LDCT/PET数据集上验证，HSANet相比现有方法获得更优越的去噪性能，同时保持轻量级模型大小，适合标准GPU部署

Conclusion: 该方法具有高度实用性，适合真实世界临床应用

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) and positron emission tomography (PET)
have emerged as safer alternatives to conventional imaging modalities by
significantly reducing radiation exposure. However, this reduction often
results in increased noise and artifacts, which can compromise diagnostic
accuracy. Consequently, denoising for LDCT/PET has become a vital area of
research aimed at enhancing image quality while maintaining radiation safety.
In this study, we introduce a novel Hybrid Swin Attention Network (HSANet),
which incorporates Efficient Global Attention (EGA) modules and a hybrid
upsampling module. The EGA modules enhance both spatial and channel-wise
interaction, improving the network's capacity to capture relevant features,
while the hybrid upsampling module mitigates the risk of overfitting to noise.
We validate the proposed approach using a publicly available LDCT/PET dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that HSANet achieves superior denoising
performance compared to existing methods, while maintaining a lightweight model
size suitable for deployment on GPUs with standard memory configurations. This
makes our approach highly practical for real-world clinical applications.

Motivation: 植物在自然生境中通常面临多种交互强迫，氨素缺乏在干旱和杂草竞争下更难识别，需要早期检测以保护植物健康

Method: 提出深度学习框架，结合RGB、多谱和两种红外波长四种成像模态，使用CNN-LSTM管道提取空间特征和时间依赖关系

Result: CNN-LSTM模型达到98%准确率，显著超过单纯空间CNN模型(80.45%)和其他机器学习方法(76%)

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效捕捉氨素缺乏、水分强迫和杂草压力之间的复杂交互作用，为及时预防性识别氨素强迫提供了有力工具

Abstract: Plants in their natural habitats endure an array of interacting stresses,
both biotic and abiotic, that rarely occur in isolation. Nutrient
stress-particularly nitrogen deficiency-becomes even more critical when
compounded with drought and weed competition, making it increasingly difficult
to distinguish and address its effects. Early detection of nitrogen stress is
therefore crucial for protecting plant health and implementing effective
management strategies. This study proposes a novel deep learning framework to
accurately classify nitrogen stress severity in a combined stress environment.
Our model uses a unique blend of four imaging modalities-RGB, multispectral,
and two infrared wavelengths-to capture a wide range of physiological plant
responses from canopy images. These images, provided as time-series data,
document plant health across three levels of nitrogen availability (low,
medium, and high) under varying water stress and weed pressures. The core of
our approach is a spatio-temporal deep learning pipeline that merges a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for extracting spatial features from images
with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies.
We also devised and evaluated a spatial-only CNN pipeline for comparison. Our
CNN-LSTM pipeline achieved an impressive accuracy of 98%, impressively
surpassing the spatial-only model's 80.45% and other previously reported
machine learning method's 76%. These results bring actionable insights based on
the power of our CNN-LSTM approach in effectively capturing the subtle and
complex interactions between nitrogen deficiency, water stress, and weed
pressure. This robust platform offers a promising tool for the timely and
proactive identification of nitrogen stress severity, enabling better crop
management and improved plant health.

Motivation: 通过高速量解释机器人收集的海底视觉图像可以提高海洋监测和探索的效率。虽然最近的研究已经表明位置元数据可以增强自盛学习，但其在不同的SSL策略、模型和海底图像数据集中的好处仍然很少被探索。

Method: 这项研究评估了位置基于正则化对六种最先进的SSL框架的影响，包括具有不同隐秘空间维度的卷积神经网络(CNN)和视觉Transformer(ViT)模型。在三个多样化的海底图像数据集上进行了评估。

Result: 位置正则化一贯地提高了下游分类性能，CNN模型平均F1分数提升4.9±4.0%，ViT模型提升6.3±8.9%。位置正则化的SSL在高维度和低维度隐秘表征上分别比预训练模型提高2.7±2.7%和10.1±9.4%。预训练ViT模型显示了强大的通用性。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了位置元数据对SSL正则化的价值，特别是在使用低维度隐秘表征时，并证明了高维度ViT模型在海底图像分析中的强大通用性。

Abstract: High-throughput interpretation of robotically gathered seafloor visual
imagery can increase the efficiency of marine monitoring and exploration.
Although recent research has suggested that location metadata can enhance
self-supervised feature learning (SSL), its benefits across different SSL
strategies, models and seafloor image datasets are underexplored. This study
evaluates the impact of location-based regularisation on six state-of-the-art
SSL frameworks, which include Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision
Transformer (ViT) models with varying latent-space dimensionality. Evaluation
across three diverse seafloor image datasets finds that location-regularisation
consistently improves downstream classification performance over standard SSL,
with average F1-score gains of $4.9 \pm 4.0%$ for CNNs and $6.3 \pm 8.9%$ for
ViTs, respectively. While CNNs pretrained on generic datasets benefit from
high-dimensional latent representations, dataset-optimised SSL achieves similar
performance across the high (512) and low (128) dimensional latent
representations. Location-regularised SSL improves CNN performance over
pre-trained models by $2.7 \pm 2.7%$ and $10.1 \pm 9.4%$ for high and
low-dimensional latent representations, respectively. For ViTs,
high-dimensionality benefits both pre-trained and dataset-optimised SSL.
Although location-regularisation improves SSL performance compared to standard
SSL methods, pre-trained ViTs show strong generalisation, matching the
best-performing location-regularised SSL with F1-scores of $0.795 \pm 0.075$
and $0.795 \pm 0.077$, respectively. The findings highlight the value of
location metadata for SSL regularisation, particularly when using
low-dimensional latent representations, and demonstrate strong generalisation
of high-dimensional ViTs for seafloor image analysis.

Conclusion: 该框架具有超越的聚类能力和强壁性，适合生成调查数据摘要和支持长期持久自主海洋探索中的信息化路径规划

Abstract: As long-endurance and seafloor-resident AUVs become more capable, there is an
increasing need for extended, real-time interpretation of seafloor imagery to
enable adaptive missions and optimise communication efficiency. Although
offline image analysis methods are well established, they rely on access to
complete datasets and human-labelled examples to manage the strong influence of
environmental and operational conditions on seafloor image
appearance-requirements that cannot be met in real-time settings. To address
this, we introduce an online clustering framework (OCF) capable of interpreting
seafloor imagery without supervision, which is designed to operate in real-time
on continuous data streams in a scalable, adaptive, and self-consistent manner.
The method enables the efficient review and consolidation of common patterns
across the entire data history in constant time by identifying and maintaining
a set of representative samples that capture the evolving feature distribution,
supporting dynamic cluster merging and splitting without reprocessing the full
image history. We evaluate the framework on three diverse seafloor image
datasets, analysing the impact of different representative sampling strategies
on both clustering accuracy and computational cost. The OCF achieves the
highest average F1 score of 0.68 across the three datasets among all
comparative online clustering approaches, with a standard deviation of 3%
across three distinct survey trajectories, demonstrating its superior
clustering capability and robustness to trajectory variation. In addition, it
maintains consistently lower and bounded computational time as the data volume
increases. These properties are beneficial for generating survey data summaries
and supporting informative path planning in long-term, persistent autonomous
marine exploration.

depth to initiate Gaussian ellipsoids using RGB-D/stereo cameras. Their limited
depth sensing range makes it difficult for GS to work in large scenes.
Monocular images, however, lack depth to guide the learning and lead to
inferior NVS results. Although large foundation models (LFMs) for monocular
depth estimation are available, they suffer from cross-frame inconsistency,
inaccuracy for distant scenes, and ambiguity in deceptive texture cues. This
paper aims to generate dense, accurate depth images from monocular RGB inputs
for high-definite GS rendering. The key idea is to leverage the accurate but
sparse depth from visual-inertial Structure-from-Motion (SfM) to refine the
dense but coarse depth from LFMs. To bridge the sparse input and dense output,
we propose an object-segmented depth propagation algorithm that renders the
depth of pixels of structured objects. Then we develop a dynamic depth
refinement module to handle the crippled SfM depth of dynamic objects and
refine the coarse LFM depth. Experiments using public and customized datasets
demonstrate the superior rendering quality of VIM-GS in large scenes.

Conclusion: BioLite U-Net在分割精度、效率和可部署性之间提供了优越的权衡，非常适合智能闭环生物打印系统。

Abstract: Bioprinting is a rapidly advancing field that offers a transformative
approach to fabricating tissue and organ models through the precise deposition
of cell-laden bioinks. Ensuring the fidelity and consistency of printed
structures in real-time remains a core challenge, particularly under
constraints imposed by limited imaging data and resource-constrained embedded
hardware. Semantic segmentation of the extrusion process, differentiating
between nozzle, extruded bioink, and surrounding background, enables in situ
monitoring critical to maintaining print quality and biological viability. In
this work, we introduce a lightweight semantic segmentation framework tailored
for real-time bioprinting applications. We present a novel, manually annotated
dataset comprising 787 RGB images captured during the bioprinting process,
labeled across three classes: nozzle, bioink, and background. To achieve fast
and efficient inference suitable for integration with bioprinting systems, we
propose a BioLite U-Net architecture that leverages depthwise separable
convolutions to drastically reduce computational load without compromising
accuracy. Our model is benchmarked against MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3-based
segmentation baselines using mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice score,
and pixel accuracy. All models were evaluated on a Raspberry Pi 4B to assess
real-world feasibility. The proposed BioLite U-Net achieves an mIoU of 92.85%
and a Dice score of 96.17%, while being over 1300x smaller than
MobileNetV2-DeepLabV3+. On-device inference takes 335 ms per frame,
demonstrating near real-time capability. Compared to MobileNet baselines,
BioLite U-Net offers a superior tradeoff between segmentation accuracy,
efficiency, and deployability, making it highly suitable for intelligent,
closed-loop bioprinting systems.

TL;DR: STAGE是一种面向分割的工业异常合成方法，通过分级扩散和显式掩码对齐技术，解决了现有方法在纹理细节、背景对齐和细粒度异常生成方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的工业异常合成方法存在两个关键问题：合成的异常缺乏精细纹理细节且难以与背景精确对齐，以及无法生成细粒度的像素级异常。这限制了异常分割性能的提升。

Method: 提出了STAGE方法：1）引入清洁背景信息作为先验来指导去噪分布；2）采用分级扩散框架，通过异常专用分支显式记录局部异常；3）使用显式掩码对齐策略逐步对齐合成异常与背景。

Result: 在MVTec和BTAD数据集上的大量实验表明，STAGE在工业异常合成方面达到了最先进的性能，并有效提升了下游异常分割任务的表现。

Conclusion: STAGE通过创新的异常推理策略和分级扩散框架，成功解决了工业异常合成中的关键挑战，为异常分割提供了更高质量的合成数据支持。

Abstract: Segmentation-oriented Industrial Anomaly Synthesis (SIAS) plays a pivotal
role in enhancing the performance of downstream anomaly segmentation, as it
provides an effective means of expanding abnormal data. However, existing SIAS
methods face several critical limitations: (i) the synthesized anomalies often
lack intricate texture details and fail to align precisely with the surrounding
background, and (ii) they struggle to generate fine-grained, pixel-level
anomalies. To address these challenges, we propose Segmentation-oriented
Anomaly synthesis via Graded diffusion with Explicit mask alignment, termed
STAGE. STAGE introduces a novel anomaly inference strategy that incorporates
clean background information as a prior to guide the denoising distribution,
enabling the model to more effectively distinguish and highlight abnormal
foregrounds. Furthermore, it employs a graded diffusion framework with an
anomaly-only branch to explicitly record local anomalies during both the
forward and reverse processes, ensuring that subtle anomalies are not
overlooked. Finally, STAGE incorporates the explicit mask alignment (EMA)
strategy to progressively align the synthesized anomalies with the background,
resulting in context-consistent and structurally coherent generations.
Extensive experiments on the MVTec and BTAD datasets demonstrate that STAGE
achieves state-of-the-art performance in SIAS, which in turn enhances
downstream anomaly segmentation.

Abstract: Brain tumors are serious health problems that require early diagnosis due to
their high mortality rates. Diagnosing tumors by examining Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) images is a process that requires expertise and is prone to
error. Therefore, the need for automated diagnosis systems is increasing day by
day. In this context, a robust and explainable Deep Learning (DL) model for the
classification of brain tumors is proposed. In this study, a publicly available
Figshare dataset containing 3,064 T1-weighted contrast-enhanced brain MRI
images of three tumor types was used. First, the classification performance of
nine well-known CNN architectures was evaluated to determine the most effective
backbone. Among these, EfficientNetV2 demonstrated the best performance and was
selected as the backbone for further development. Subsequently, an
attention-based MLP-Mixer architecture was integrated into EfficientNetV2 to
enhance its classification capability. The performance of the final model was
comprehensively compared with basic CNNs and the methods in the literature.
Additionally, Grad-CAM visualization was used to interpret and validate the
decision-making process of the proposed model. The proposed model's performance
was evaluated using the five-fold cross-validation method. The proposed model
demonstrated superior performance with 99.50% accuracy, 99.47% precision,
99.52% recall and 99.49% F1 score. The results obtained show that the model
outperforms the studies in the literature. Moreover, Grad-CAM visualizations
demonstrate that the model effectively focuses on relevant regions of MRI
images, thus improving interpretability and clinical reliability. A robust deep
learning model for clinical decision support systems has been obtained by
combining EfficientNetV2 and attention-based MLP-Mixer, providing high accuracy
and interpretability in brain tumor classification.

Motivation: 现有轨迹引导I2V生成方法要么需要大量计算资源进行微调，要么在潜在空间中进行轨迹控制时忽略3D视角导致运动不真实，存在潜在空间操作与网络噪声预测不匹配的问题。

Method: 1) 3D感知运动投影：利用场景深度推断进行透视校正的仿射变换；2) 轨迹引导测试时LoRA：动态注入和优化临时LoRA适配器，通过区域特征一致性损失实现运动约束；3) 引导场校正：通过一步前瞻策略优化条件引导场。

Conclusion: Zo3T框架通过创新的测试时训练机制，成功解决了轨迹引导视频生成中的3D真实性和运动准确性问题，为无需大量标注数据的视频生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Trajectory-Guided image-to-video (I2V) generation aims to synthesize videos
that adhere to user-specified motion instructions. Existing methods typically
rely on computationally expensive fine-tuning on scarce annotated datasets.
Although some zero-shot methods attempt to trajectory control in the latent
space, they may yield unrealistic motion by neglecting 3D perspective and
creating a misalignment between the manipulated latents and the network's noise
predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce Zo3T, a novel zero-shot
test-time-training framework for trajectory-guided generation with three core
innovations: First, we incorporate a 3D-Aware Kinematic Projection, leveraging
inferring scene depth to derive perspective-correct affine transformations for
target regions. Second, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Test-Time LoRA, a
mechanism that dynamically injects and optimizes ephemeral LoRA adapters into
the denoising network alongside the latent state. Driven by a regional feature
consistency loss, this co-adaptation effectively enforces motion constraints
while allowing the pre-trained model to locally adapt its internal
representations to the manipulated latent, thereby ensuring generative fidelity
and on-manifold adherence. Finally, we develop Guidance Field Rectification,
which refines the denoising evolutionary path by optimizing the conditional
guidance field through a one-step lookahead strategy, ensuring efficient
generative progression towards the target trajectory. Zo3T significantly
enhances 3D realism and motion accuracy in trajectory-controlled I2V
generation, demonstrating superior performance over existing training-based and
zero-shot approaches.

Conclusion: Co-Seg框架通过协同组织分割和细胞核分割任务，实现了相互增强的效果，为组织病理学图像分析提供了更全面的解决方案

Abstract: Histopathology image analysis is critical yet challenged by the demand of
segmenting tissue regions and nuclei instances for tumor microenvironment and
cellular morphology analysis. Existing studies focused on tissue semantic
segmentation or nuclei instance segmentation separately, but ignored the
inherent relationship between these two tasks, resulting in insufficient
histopathology understanding. To address this issue, we propose a Co-Seg
framework for collaborative tissue and nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we
introduce a novel co-segmentation paradigm, allowing tissue and nuclei
segmentation tasks to mutually enhance each other. To this end, we first devise
a region-aware prompt encoder (RP-Encoder) to provide high-quality semantic and
instance region prompts as prior constraints. Moreover, we design a mutual
prompt mask decoder (MP-Decoder) that leverages cross-guidance to strengthen
the contextual consistency of both tasks, collaboratively computing semantic
and instance segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on the PUMA dataset
demonstrate that the proposed Co-Seg surpasses state-of-the-arts in the
semantic, instance and panoptic segmentation of tumor tissues and nuclei
instances. The source code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/Co-Seg.

Abstract: Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in forest
environments for tasks such as environmental monitoring and search and rescue,
which require safe navigation through dense foliage and precise data
collection. Traditional sensing approaches, including passive multispectral and
RGB imaging, suffer from latency, poor depth resolution, and strong dependence
on ambient light - especially under forest canopies. In this work, we present a
novel event spectroscopy system that simultaneously enables high-resolution,
low-latency depth reconstruction and multispectral imaging using a single
sensor. Depth is reconstructed using structured light, and by modulating the
wavelength of the projected structured light, our system captures spectral
information in controlled bands between 650 nm and 850 nm. We demonstrate up to
$60\%$ improvement in RMSE over commercial depth sensors and validate the
spectral accuracy against a reference spectrometer and commercial multispectral
cameras, demonstrating comparable performance. A portable version limited to
RGB (3 wavelengths) is used to collect real-world depth and spectral data from
a Masoala Rainforest. We demonstrate the use of this prototype for color image
reconstruction and material differentiation between leaves and branches using
spectral and depth data. Our results show that adding depth (available at no
extra effort with our setup) to material differentiation improves the accuracy
by over $30\%$ compared to color-only method. Our system, tested in both lab
and real-world rainforest environments, shows strong performance in depth
estimation, RGB reconstruction, and material differentiation - paving the way
for lightweight, integrated, and robust UAV perception and data collection in
complex natural environments.

Abstract: Event cameras offer unique advantages such as high temporal resolution, low
latency, and high dynamic range, making them more and more popular for vision
tasks under challenging light conditions. However, their high cost, limited

particularly for early-stage development and prototyping. In this work, we
present Raw2Event, a complete hardware-software system that enables real-time

access to raw Bayer data and bypassing traditional image signal processors

delivering higher dynamic range, higher resolution, and more faithful output
than RGB-based frame-to-event converters.
  Built upon the DVS-Voltmeter model, Raw2Event features a configurable
simulation framework optimized for deployment on embedded platforms. We further
design a data acquisition pipeline that supports synchronized recording of raw,
RGB, and event streams, facilitating downstream evaluation and dataset
creation. Experimental results show that Raw2Event can generate event streams
closely resembling those from real event cameras, while benefiting from higher
resolution and autofocus capabilities. The system also supports user-intuitive
parameter tuning, enabling flexible adaptation to various application
requirements. Finally, we deploy the system on a Raspberry Pi for real-time

Abstract: Dark humor in online memes poses unique challenges due to its reliance on
implicit, sensitive, and culturally contextual cues. To address the lack of
resources and methods for detecting dark humor in multimodal content, we
introduce a novel dataset of 4,379 Reddit memes annotated for dark humor,
target category (gender, mental health, violence, race, disability, and other),
and a three-level intensity rating (mild, moderate, severe). Building on this
resource, we propose a reasoning-augmented framework that first generates
structured explanations for each meme using a Large Vision-Language Model
(VLM). Through a Role-Reversal Self-Loop, VLM adopts the author's perspective
to iteratively refine its explanations, ensuring completeness and alignment. We
then extract textual features from both the OCR transcript and the self-refined
reasoning via a text encoder, while visual features are obtained using a vision
transformer. A Tri-stream Cross-Reasoning Network (TCRNet) fuses these three
streams, text, image, and reasoning, via pairwise attention mechanisms,
producing a unified representation for classification. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong baselines across three tasks:
dark humor detection, target identification, and intensity prediction. The
dataset, annotations, and code are released to facilitate further research in
multimodal humor understanding and content moderation. Code and Dataset are

Abstract: This article presents UrbanTwin datasets - high-fidelity, realistic replicas
of three public roadside lidar datasets: LUMPI, V2X-Real-IC, and TUMTraf-I.
Each UrbanTwin dataset contains 10K annotated frames corresponding to one of
the public datasets. Annotations include 3D bounding boxes, instance
segmentation labels, and tracking IDs for six object classes, along with
semantic segmentation labels for nine classes. These datasets are synthesized
using emulated lidar sensors within realistic digital twins, modeled based on
surrounding geometry, road alignment at lane level, and the lane topology and
vehicle movement patterns at intersections of the actual locations
corresponding to each real dataset. Due to the precise digital twin modeling,
the synthetic datasets are well aligned with their real counterparts, offering
strong standalone and augmentative value for training deep learning models on
tasks such as 3D object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance
segmentation. We evaluate the alignment of the synthetic replicas through
statistical and structural similarity analysis with real data, and further
demonstrate their utility by training 3D object detection models solely on
synthetic data and testing them on real, unseen data. The high similarity
scores and improved detection performance, compared to the models trained on
real data, indicate that the UrbanTwin datasets effectively enhance existing
benchmark datasets by increasing sample size and scene diversity. In addition,
the digital twins can be adapted to test custom scenarios by modifying the
design and dynamics of the simulations. To our knowledge, these are the first
digitally synthesized datasets that can replace in-domain real-world datasets
for lidar perception tasks. UrbanTwin datasets are publicly available at

of any 3D objects into components. Inspired by SAM, P3-SAM consists of a
feature extractor, multiple segmentation heads, and an IoU predictor, enabling
interactive segmentation for users. We also propose an algorithm to
automatically select and merge masks predicted by our model for part instance
segmentation. Our model is trained on a newly built dataset containing nearly
3.7 million models with reasonable segmentation labels. Comparisons show that
our method achieves precise segmentation results and strong robustness on any
complex objects, attaining state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be
released soon.

*Yufeng Cheng,Wenxu Wu,Shaojin Wu,Mengqi Huang,Fei Ding,Qian He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UMO是一个统一的多身份优化框架，通过多对多匹配范式和强化学习来解决图像定制中身份混淆问题，显著提升身份一致性并减少混淆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类对脸部更敏感，现有图像定制方法在多参考图像下难以保持身份一致性且容易产生身份混淆，限制了身份可扩展性。

Method: 提出UMO框架，将多身份生成重新表述为全局分配优化问题，通过扩散模型的强化学习实现多身份一致性，并构建了包含合成和真实数据的多参考图像数据集。

Result: 大量实验表明UMO显著提高了身份一致性，减少了身份混淆，在开源方法中达到了身份保持维度上的最先进水平。

Conclusion: UMO有效解决了多身份图像定制中的身份混淆问题，为现有图像定制方法提供了通用的多身份一致性解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in image customization exhibit a wide range of
application prospects due to stronger customization capabilities. However,
since we humans are more sensitive to faces, a significant challenge remains in
preserving consistent identity while avoiding identity confusion with
multi-reference images, limiting the identity scalability of customization
models. To address this, we present UMO, a Unified Multi-identity Optimization
framework, designed to maintain high-fidelity identity preservation and
alleviate identity confusion with scalability. With "multi-to-multi matching"
paradigm, UMO reformulates multi-identity generation as a global assignment
optimization problem and unleashes multi-identity consistency for existing
image customization methods generally through reinforcement learning on
diffusion models. To facilitate the training of UMO, we develop a scalable
customization dataset with multi-reference images, consisting of both
synthesised and real parts. Additionally, we propose a new metric to measure
identity confusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMO not only
improves identity consistency significantly, but also reduces identity
confusion on several image customization methods, setting a new
state-of-the-art among open-source methods along the dimension of identity
preserving. Code and model: https://github.com/bytedance/UMO

Motivation: 传统方法需要大量标注数据、泛化能力差且特征学习效率低，无法满足快速增长的可视内容消费平台对MPAA年龄分级标准自动化的需求

Method: 采用对比学习(实例判别、上下文对比、多视图对比三种框架)，结合LRCN(CNN+LSTM)骨干网络和Bahdanau注意力机制，评估多种对比损失函数

Result: 在Contextual Contrastive Learning框架下达到88%准确率和0.8815 F1分数，能够有效区分PG-13和R级内容等细粒度边界

Conclusion: 提出的混合架构在对比学习框架下表现出色，已部署为实时MPAA分级分类的Web应用，为流媒体平台提供高效的内容合规解决方案

Abstract: The rapid growth of visual content consumption across platforms necessitates
automated video classification for age-suitability standards like the MPAA
rating system (G, PG, PG-13, R). Traditional methods struggle with large
labeled data requirements, poor generalization, and inefficient feature
learning. To address these challenges, we employ contrastive learning for
improved discrimination and adaptability, exploring three frameworks: Instance
Discrimination, Contextual Contrastive Learning, and Multi-View Contrastive
Learning. Our hybrid architecture integrates an LRCN (CNN+LSTM) backbone with a
Bahdanau attention mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the
Contextual Contrastive Learning framework, with 88% accuracy and an F1 score of
0.8815. By combining CNNs for spatial features, LSTMs for temporal modeling,
and attention mechanisms for dynamic frame prioritization, the model excels in
fine-grained borderline distinctions, such as differentiating PG-13 and R-rated
content. We evaluate the model's performance across various contrastive loss
functions, including NT-Xent, NT-logistic, and Margin Triplet, demonstrating
the robustness of our proposed architecture. To ensure practical application,
the model is deployed as a web application for real-time MPAA rating
classification, offering an efficient solution for automated content compliance
across streaming platforms.

Conclusion: 该方法有望充分利用3D生成技术的优势，为自动驾驶感知训练提供更多样化和稀有的场景数据

Abstract: In the field of autonomous driving, sensor simulation is essential for
generating rare and diverse scenarios that are difficult to capture in
real-world environments. Current solutions fall into two categories: 1)
CG-based methods, such as CARLA, which lack diversity and struggle to scale to
the vast array of rare cases required for robust perception training; and 2)
learning-based approaches, such as NeuSim, which are limited to specific object
categories (vehicles) and require extensive multi-sensor data, hindering their
applicability to generic objects. To address these limitations, we propose a
scalable real2sim2real system that leverages 3D generation to automate asset
mining, generation, and rare-case data synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI辅助放射学诊断主要基于单一任务的窄模型，无法覆盖广泛的影像模态和疾病谱。基础模型在放射学领域的潜力尚未充分实现。

Method: 使用一家大型医院多年来的全部横断面影像输出（15万次检查，130TB数据）训练Curia基础模型，并在新构建的19任务外部验证基准上进行评估。

Result: Curia能准确识别器官、检测脑出血和心肌梗死等疾病、预测肿瘤分期结果，在跨模态和少数据场景下展现出临床显著的新兴特性。

Conclusion: Curia证明了基础模型在放射学中的可行性，其性能达到或超过放射科医生和近期基础模型，为加速该领域进展，模型权重已公开发布。

Abstract: AI-assisted radiological interpretation is based on predominantly narrow,
single-task models. This approach is impractical for covering the vast spectrum
of imaging modalities, diseases, and radiological findings. Foundation models
(FMs) hold the promise of broad generalization across modalities and in
low-data settings. However, this potential has remained largely unrealized in
radiology. We introduce Curia, a foundation model trained on the entire
cross-sectional imaging output of a major hospital over several years, which to
our knowledge is the largest such corpus of real-world data-encompassing
150,000 exams (130 TB). On a newly curated 19-task external validation
benchmark, Curia accurately identifies organs, detects conditions like brain
hemorrhages and myocardial infarctions, and predicts outcomes in tumor staging.
Curia meets or surpasses the performance of radiologists and recent foundation
models, and exhibits clinically significant emergent properties in
cross-modality, and low-data regimes. To accelerate progress, we release our
base model's weights at https://huggingface.co/raidium/curia.

Abstract: We introduce MIORe and VAR-MIORe, two novel multi-task datasets that address
critical limitations in current motion restoration benchmarks. Designed with
high-frame-rate (1000 FPS) acquisition and professional-grade optics, our
datasets capture a broad spectrum of motion scenarios, which include complex
ego-camera movements, dynamic multi-subject interactions, and depth-dependent
blur effects. By adaptively averaging frames based on computed optical flow
metrics, MIORe generates consistent motion blur, and preserves sharp inputs for
video frame interpolation and optical flow estimation. VAR-MIORe further
extends by spanning a variable range of motion magnitudes, from minimal to
extreme, establishing the first benchmark to offer explicit control over motion
amplitude. We provide high-resolution, scalable ground truths that challenge
existing algorithms under both controlled and adverse conditions, paving the
way for next-generation research of various image and video restoration tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索通过迁移学习调整通用基础模型和整合手术室多模态数据来支持手术数据科学研究的潜力。

Method: 使用V-JEPA作为单模态基础模型，通过在未标注手术视频数据上微调进行领域适配，并整合手术室的其他时间分辨数据流构建多模态模型。

Result: 领域特定数据微调和多模态数据整合都显著提升了模型性能，在手术阶段识别任务上达到了竞赛顶级水平，并在预测住院时间和手术后并发症任务上也取得了良好效果。

Conclusion: 手术数据科学可以利用公开的通用基础模型，通过领域适配和整合适当的补充数据流来获得显著性能提升，为手术决策支持系统提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We investigate how both the adaptation of a generic foundation model via
transfer learning and the integration of complementary modalities from the
operating room (OR) can support surgical data science. To this end, we use
V-JEPA as the single-modality foundation of a multimodal model for minimally
invasive surgery support. We analyze how the model's downstream performance can
benefit (a) from finetuning on unlabeled surgical video data and (b) from
providing additional time-resolved data streams from the OR in a multimodal
setup.
  In an in-house dataset of liver surgery videos, we analyze the tasks of
predicting hospital length of stay and postoperative complications. In videos
of the public HeiCo dataset, we analyze the task of surgical phase recognition.
As a baseline, we apply pretrained V-JEPA to all tasks. We then finetune it on
unlabeled, held-out videos to investigate its change in performance after
domain adaptation. Following the idea of modular decision support networks, we
integrate additional data streams from the OR by training a separate encoder to
form a shared representation space with V-JEPA's embeddings.
  Our experiments show that finetuning on domain-specific data increases model
performance. On the in-house data, integrating additional time-resolved data
likewise benefits the model. On the HeiCo data, accuracy of the pretrained
video-only, single-modality baseline setup is on par with the top-performing
submissions of the EndoVis2017 challenge, while finetuning on domain-specific
data increases accuracy further. Our results thus demonstrate how surgical data
science can leverage public, generic foundation models. Likewise, they indicate
the potential of domain adaptation and of integrating suitable complementary
data streams from the OR. To support further research, we release our code and
model weights at https://github.com/DigitalSurgeryLab-Basel/ML-CDS-2025.

Abstract: Assessing the severity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using the Total Sharp/Van
Der Heijde Score (TSS) is crucial, but manual scoring is often time-consuming
and subjective. This study introduces an Automated Radiographic Sharp Scoring
(ARTSS) framework that leverages deep learning to analyze full-hand X-ray
images, aiming to reduce inter- and intra-observer variability. The research
uniquely accommodates patients with joint disappearance and variable-length
image sequences. We developed ARTSS using data from 970 patients, structured
into four stages: I) Image pre-processing and re-orientation using ResNet50,
II) Hand segmentation using UNet.3, III) Joint identification using YOLOv7, and
IV) TSS prediction using models such as VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, DenseNet201,
EfficientNetB0, and Vision Transformer (ViT). We evaluated model performance
with Intersection over Union (IoU), Mean Average Precision (MAP), mean absolute
error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Huber loss. The average TSS
from two radiologists was used as the ground truth. Model training employed
3-fold cross-validation, with each fold consisting of 452 training and 227
validation samples, and external testing included 291 unseen subjects. Our
joint identification model achieved 99% accuracy. The best-performing model,
ViT, achieved a notably low Huber loss of 0.87 for TSS prediction. Our results
demonstrate the potential of deep learning to automate RA scoring, which can
significantly enhance clinical practice. Our approach addresses the challenge
of joint disappearance and variable joint numbers, offers timesaving benefits,
reduces inter- and intra-reader variability, improves radiologist accuracy, and
aids rheumatologists in making more informed decisions.

Conclusion: 该拓扑自适应方法有效解决了含拓扑伪影的3D网格匹配问题，无需数据先验即可实现高质量对齐，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Non-rigid 3D mesh matching is a critical step in computer vision and computer
graphics pipelines. We tackle matching meshes that contain topological
artefacts which can break the assumption made by current approaches. While
Functional Maps assume the deformation induced by the ground truth
correspondences to be near-isometric, ARAP-like deformation-guided approaches
assume the latter to be ARAP. Neither assumption holds in certain topological
configurations of the input shapes. We are motivated by real-world scenarios
such as per-frame multi-view reconstructions, often suffering from topological
artefacts. To this end, we propose a topology-adaptive deformation model
allowing changes in shape topology to align shape pairs under ARAP and
bijective association constraints. Using this model, we jointly optimise for a
template mesh with adequate topology and for its alignment with the shapes to
be matched to extract correspondences. We show that, while not relying on any
data-driven prior, our approach applies to highly non-isometric shapes and
shapes with topological artefacts, including noisy per-frame multi-view
reconstructions, even outperforming methods trained on large datasets in 3D
alignment quality.

Abstract: Automatic License-Plate Recognition (ALPR) plays a pivotal role in
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) as a fundamental element of Smart
Cities. However, due to its high variability, ALPR faces challenging issues
more efficiently addressed by deep learning techniques. In this paper, a
selective Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is proposed for deblurring in
the preprocessing step, coupled with the state-of-the-art You-Only-Look-Once
(YOLO)v5 object detection architectures for License-Plate Detection (LPD), and
the integrated Character Segmentation (CS) and Character Recognition (CR)
steps. The selective preprocessing bypasses unnecessary and sometimes
counter-productive input manipulations, while YOLOv5 LPD/CS+CR delivers high
accuracy and low computing cost. As a result, YOLOv5 achieves a detection time
of 0.026 seconds for both LP and CR detection stages, facilitating real-time
applications with exceptionally rapid responsiveness. Moreover, the proposed
model achieves accuracy rates of 95\% and 97\% in the LPD and CR detection
phases, respectively. Furthermore, the inclusion of the Deblur-GAN
pre-processor significantly improves detection accuracy by nearly 40\%,
especially when encountering blurred License Plates (LPs).To train and test the
learning components, we generated and publicly released our blur and ALPR
datasets (using Iranian license plates as a use-case), which are more
representative of close-to-real-life ad-hoc situations. The findings
demonstrate that employing the state-of-the-art YOLO model results in excellent
overall precision and detection time, making it well-suited for portable
applications. Additionally, integrating the Deblur-GAN model as a preliminary
processing step enhances the overall effectiveness of our comprehensive model,
particularly when confronted with blurred scenes captured by the camera as
input.

Motivation: 解决视频姿态Transformer(VPT)模型计算成本高、在资源受限设备上实用性差的问题

Method: 提出H2OT框架，包含令牌剪枝模块(TPM)和令牌恢复模块(TRM)。TPM动态选择代表性帧的少量令牌，TRM恢复详细时空信息并扩展到原始序列长度

Result: 在多个标准数据集上验证了方法的有效性和效率，可简化常见VPT模型的seq2seq和seq2frame流水线

Conclusion: 维护完整姿态序列并非必要，少量代表性帧的令牌即可同时实现高效率和高精度的估计

Abstract: Transformers have been successfully applied in the field of video-based 3D
human pose estimation. However, the high computational costs of these video
pose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices.
In this paper, we present a hierarchical plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering
framework, called Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer (H$_{2}$OT), for efficient
transformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. H$_{2}$OT begins with
progressively pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering
full-length sequences, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate
transformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. It works with two
key modules, namely, a Token Pruning Module (TPM) and a Token Recovering Module
(TRM). TPM dynamically selects a few representative tokens to eliminate the
redundancy of video frames, while TRM restores the detailed spatio-temporal
information based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output
to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Our method
is general-purpose: it can be easily incorporated into common VPT models on
both seq2seq and seq2frame pipelines while effectively accommodating different
token pruning and recovery strategies. In addition, our H$_{2}$OT reveals that
maintaining the full pose sequence is unnecessary, and a few pose tokens of
representative frames can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate both the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Code and models are
available at https://github.com/NationalGAILab/HoT.

TL;DR: 轻量级医学图像分割模型，结合Swin Transformer编码器和U-Net解码器，通过Barlow Twins自监督预训练和精细调整，实现高准确性与快速推理的平衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统卷积网络感矩场局限性和Transformer模型计算费用高的问题，为实时医学图像分割提供简洁高效的解决方案

Method: 设计浅层结构，结合Swin Transformer类编码器和U-Net类解码器，通过skip路径保持空间细节；先使用Barlow Twins自监督方法预训练编码器，然后对整体模型进行精细调整

Result: 在二值分割开发任务中达到竞争性的准确度，同时参数数量显著减少且推理速度更快

Conclusion: 该模型为实时和资源受限的临床环境提供了一个实用的替代方案，平衡了性能与效率

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in clinical workflows,
particularly for the detection and delineation of pathological regions. While
convolutional architectures like U-Net have become standard for such tasks,
their limited receptive field restricts global context modeling. Recent efforts
integrating transformers have addressed this, but often result in deep,
computationally expensive models unsuitable for real-time use. In this work, we
present a novel end-to-end lightweight architecture designed specifically for
real-time binary medical image segmentation. Our model combines a Swin
Transformer-like encoder with a U-Net-like decoder, connected via skip pathways
to preserve spatial detail while capturing contextual information. Unlike
existing designs such as Swin Transformer or U-Net, our architecture is
significantly shallower and competitively efficient. To improve the encoder's
ability to learn meaningful features without relying on large amounts of
labeled data, we first train it using Barlow Twins, a self-supervised learning
method that helps the model focus on important patterns by reducing unnecessary
repetition in the learned features. After this pretraining, we fine-tune the
entire model for our specific task. Experiments on benchmark binary
segmentation tasks demonstrate that our model achieves competitive accuracy
with substantially reduced parameter count and faster inference, positioning it
as a practical alternative for deployment in real-time and resource-limited
clinical environments. The code for our method is available at Github

*Minheng Chen,Youyong Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出在非欧几里得球面特征空间中进行相似性学习，通过Riemannian距离在SO(4)空间中近似测地距离，提升2D/3D配准的准确性和收敛速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有欧几里得近似方法扭曲流形结构并减缓收敛速度，需要更好的方法来捕捉复杂流形结构

Method: 使用CNN-Transformer编码器提取特征嵌入，投影到球面空间，在双不变SO(4)空间中使用Riemannian距离近似测地距离，推理时使用可微Levenberg-Marquardt优化

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上实验显示，在患者特定和患者无关场景下均获得优越的准确性

Conclusion: 提出的非欧几里得球面特征空间相似性学习方法能够更好地捕捉流形结构，提高配准精度和收敛性能

Abstract: Intraoperative 2D/3D registration aligns preoperative 3D volumes with
real-time 2D radiographs, enabling accurate localization of instruments and
implants. A recent fully differentiable similarity learning framework
approximates geodesic distances on SE(3), expanding the capture range of
registration and mitigating the effects of substantial disturbances, but
existing Euclidean approximations distort manifold structure and slow
convergence. To address these limitations, we explore similarity learning in
non-Euclidean spherical feature spaces to better capture and fit complex
manifold structure. We extract feature embeddings using a CNN-Transformer
encoder, project them into spherical space, and approximate their geodesic
distances with Riemannian distances in the bi-invariant SO(4) space. This
enables a more expressive and geometrically consistent deep similarity metric,
enhancing the ability to distinguish subtle pose differences. During inference,
we replace gradient descent with fully differentiable Levenberg-Marquardt
optimization to accelerate convergence. Experiments on real and synthetic
datasets show superior accuracy in both patient-specific and patient-agnostic
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BIR-Adapter是一种低复杂度的盲图像恢复适配器，无需训练额外特征提取器即可利用预训练扩散模型的先验知识进行盲图像恢复，性能优越且复杂度低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用预训练大规模扩散模型的鲁棒性，在无需训练辅助特征提取器的情况下实现盲图像恢复，降低计算复杂度。

Method: 通过模型本身从退化图像中提取特征，扩展自注意力机制使用这些退化特征，并引入采样指导机制减少幻觉。

Result: 在合成和真实退化场景下，BIR-Adapter达到或超越最先进方法的性能，同时具有显著更低的复杂度，并能集成到其他扩散模型中。

Conclusion: BIR-Adapter提供了一种高效、低复杂度的盲图像恢复解决方案，具有良好的扩展性和应用前景。

Abstract: This paper introduces BIR-Adapter, a low-complexity blind image restoration
adapter for diffusion models. The BIR-Adapter enables the utilization of the
prior of pre-trained large-scale diffusion models on blind image restoration
without training any auxiliary feature extractor. We take advantage of the
robustness of pretrained models. We extract features from degraded images via
the model itself and extend the self-attention mechanism with these degraded
features. We introduce a sampling guidance mechanism to reduce hallucinations.
We perform experiments on synthetic and real-world degradations and demonstrate
that BIR-Adapter achieves competitive or better performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while having significantly lower complexity.
Additionally, its adapter-based design enables integration into other diffusion
models, enabling broader applications in image restoration tasks. We showcase
this by extending a super-resolution-only model to perform better under
additional unknown degradations.

TL;DR: FoMo4Wheat是首个作物领域视觉基础模型，通过在最大的小麦图像数据集ImAg4Wheat上进行自监督预训练，显著提升了田间视觉任务的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用预训练模型在农业领域泛化能力不足，无法有效处理精细多变的冠层结构和波动的田间条件，需要作物特定的基础模型。

Method: 使用自监督学习方法在ImAg4Wheat数据集（250万张高分辨率小麦图像，覆盖2000多个基因型和500多种环境条件）上进行预训练，构建小麦专用视觉基础模型。

Result: 在10个田间视觉任务中，FoMo4Wheat模型在冠层和器官层面均优于最先进的通用预训练模型，表现出对小麦的鲁棒性和对其他作物及杂草的可迁移性。

Conclusion: 作物特定基础模型对可靠的田间感知具有重要价值，为构建具有跨物种和跨任务能力的通用作物基础模型指明了方向。

Abstract: Vision-driven field monitoring is central to digital agriculture, yet models
built on general-domain pretrained backbones often fail to generalize across
tasks, owing to the interaction of fine, variable canopy structures with
fluctuating field conditions. We present FoMo4Wheat, one of the first
crop-domain vision foundation model pretrained with self-supervision on
ImAg4Wheat, the largest and most diverse wheat image dataset to date (2.5
million high-resolution images collected over a decade at 30 global sites,
spanning >2,000 genotypes and >500 environmental conditions). This
wheat-specific pretraining yields representations that are robust for wheat and
transferable to other crops and weeds. Across ten in-field vision tasks at
canopy and organ levels, FoMo4Wheat models consistently outperform
state-of-the-art models pretrained on general-domain dataset. These results
demonstrate the value of crop-specific foundation models for reliable in-field
perception and chart a path toward a universal crop foundation model with
cross-species and cross-task capabilities. FoMo4Wheat models and the ImAg4Wheat
dataset are publicly available online: https://github.com/PheniX-Lab/FoMo4Wheat

Method: 通过实验分析语音编码器和聚类粒度在不同模型规模下的作用，研究聚类分布和音素对齐，考察聚类数据选择对模型鲁棒性的影响。

Result: 发现最优离散化策略随模型容量变化，揭示了语言和副语言模式，证明了离散化训练与目标应用领域匹配的重要性。

Conclusion: 离散单元表示在语音语言模型中具有重要作用，模型架构、数据表示和训练策略需要根据具体应用场景进行优化配置。

Abstract: This paper investigates discrete unit representations in Speech Language
Models (SLMs), focusing on optimizing speech modeling during continual
pre-training. In this paper, we systematically examine how model architecture,
data representation, and training robustness influence the pre-training stage
in which we adapt existing pre-trained language models to the speech modality.
Our experiments highlight the role of speech encoders and clustering
granularity across different model scales, showing how optimal discretization
strategies vary with model capacity. By examining cluster distribution and
phonemic alignments, we investigate the effective use of discrete vocabulary,
uncovering both linguistic and paralinguistic patterns. Additionally, we
explore the impact of clustering data selection on model robustness,
highlighting the importance of domain matching between discretization training
and target applications.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于N-Gram频率张量的新题检测方法，通过张量分解提取特征训练分类器，在HaluEval数据集上显著提升了幻觉检测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的幻觉检测方法依赖的ROUGE、BERTScore等基础指标缺乏足够的语义深度，无法有效区分事实和幻觉内容

Method: 构建N-Gram频率张量来描述语言生成文本的共现模式，通过张量分解提取奇异值特征，使用MLP二元分类器进行幻觉检测

Result: 在HaluEval数据集上实验显示，该方法比传统基准方法有显著提升，与最先进的LLM判官方法相比也具有竞争力

Conclusion: 通迅张量表征提取语言生成文本的丰富语义结构，为大语言模型幻觉检测提供了一种有效的新方法

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness across a wide
variety of tasks involving natural language, however, a fundamental problem of
hallucinations still plagues these models, limiting their trustworthiness in
generating consistent, truthful information. Detecting hallucinations has
quickly become an important topic, with various methods such as uncertainty
estimation, LLM Judges, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and consistency
checks showing promise. Many of these methods build upon foundational metrics,
such as ROUGE, BERTScore, or Perplexity, which often lack the semantic depth
necessary to detect hallucinations effectively. In this work, we propose a
novel approach inspired by ROUGE that constructs an N-Gram frequency tensor
from LLM-generated text. This tensor captures richer semantic structure by
encoding co-occurrence patterns, enabling better differentiation between
factual and hallucinated content. We demonstrate this by applying tensor
decomposition methods to extract singular values from each mode and use these
as input features to train a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) binary classifier for
hallucinations. Our method is evaluated on the HaluEval dataset and
demonstrates significant improvements over traditional baselines, as well as
competitive performance against state-of-the-art LLM judges.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SAGE是一个触发引导的动态微调框架，能够在推理时进行自适应更新，通过检测推理失败、聚类异常样本和动态优化参数来解决大语言模型无法在推理时持续学习的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在推理时无法持续适应和学习新数据，这限制了其在复杂推理任务中的表现。

Method: SAGE包含三个核心组件：触发模块实时检测推理失败、触发缓冲模块使用HDBSCAN聚类异常样本并进行稳定性检查、Lora存储模块通过适配器池动态优化参数更新。

Result: 评估结果显示SAGE在原子推理子任务上通过动态知识更新表现出优秀的准确性、鲁棒性和稳定性。

Conclusion: SAGE框架有效解决了大语言模型在推理时无法持续学习的问题，为复杂推理任务提供了可行的动态适应解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models are unable to continuously adapt and learn from new
data during reasoning at inference time. To address this limitation, we propose
that complex reasoning tasks be decomposed into atomic subtasks and introduce
SAGE, a trigger-guided dynamic fine-tuning framework that enables adaptive
updates during reasoning at inference time. SAGE consists of three key
components: (1) a Trigger module that detects reasoning failures through
multiple evaluation metrics in real time; (2) a Trigger Buffer module that
clusters anomaly samples using a streaming clustering process with HDBSCAN,
followed by stability checks and similarity-based merging; and (3) a Lora Store
module that dynamically optimizes parameter updates with an adapter pool for
knowledge retention. Evaluation results show that SAGE demonstrates excellent
accuracy, robustness, and stability on the atomic reasoning subtask through
dynamic knowledge updating during test time.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 多智能体辩论有时反而有害，特别是在不同能力模型混合时，即使强模型占多数也可能导致准确率下降，因为模型倾向于达成共识而非挑战错误推理


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索模型能力多样性如何影响多智能体辩论的动态和结果，发现现有研究只关注同质智能体群体，而异质性可能导致辩论有害

Method: 通过一系列实验研究不同能力模型混合的辩论场景，分析模型在辩论过程中的行为变化和答案转变

Result: 辩论会导致准确率随时间下降，模型经常从正确答案转向错误答案，倾向于达成共识而非挑战有缺陷的推理

Conclusion: 多智能体辩论存在重要失败模式，当智能体既没有激励也没有足够能力抵抗有说服力但错误的推理时，简单的辩论应用可能导致性能下降

Abstract: While multi-agent debate has been proposed as a promising strategy for
improving AI reasoning ability, we find that debate can sometimes be harmful
rather than helpful. The prior work has exclusively focused on debates within
homogeneous groups of agents, whereas we explore how diversity in model
capabilities influences the dynamics and outcomes of multi-agent interactions.
Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that debate can lead to a
decrease in accuracy over time -- even in settings where stronger (i.e., more
capable) models outnumber their weaker counterparts. Our analysis reveals that
models frequently shift from correct to incorrect answers in response to peer
reasoning, favoring agreement over challenging flawed reasoning. These results
highlight important failure modes in the exchange of reasons during multi-agent
debate, suggesting that naive applications of debate may cause performance
degradation when agents are neither incentivized nor adequately equipped to
resist persuasive but incorrect reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索不依赖实际翻译系统运行就能预测翻译质量的方法，为多语言评估和质量估计提供新视角

Method: 使用梯度提升模型，基于词汇生育率比值、词汇数量和基本语言元数据（语系、文字、地区）等少量特征

Result: 在FLORES-200基准测试中取得良好性能（XX→英语 R²=0.66，英语→XX R²=0.72），特征重要性分析显示类型学因素对英译预测主导，生育率对多语言翻译更重要

Conclusion: 翻译质量同时受词汇层面生育率和更广泛的语言类型学因素影响，这为多语言评估和质量估计提供了新的见解

Abstract: We show that translation quality can be predicted with surprising accuracy
\textit{without ever running the translation system itself}. Using only a
handful of features, token fertility ratios, token counts, and basic linguistic
metadata (language family, script, and region), we can forecast ChrF scores for
GPT-4o translations across 203 languages in the FLORES-200 benchmark. Gradient
boosting models achieve favorable performance ($R^{2}=0.66$ for
XX$\rightarrow$English and $R^{2}=0.72$ for English$\rightarrow$XX). Feature
importance analyses reveal that typological factors dominate predictions into
English, while fertility plays a larger role for translations into diverse
target languages. These findings suggest that translation quality is shaped by
both token-level fertility and broader linguistic typology, offering new
insights for multilingual evaluation and quality estimation.

Motivation: 现有的成对比较方法虽然在样本级表现上效果好，但缺乏给单个摘要赋予绝对分数的能力，而这对需要设置阈值的应用场景至关重要。

Method: 提出一种直接评分方法，使用合成摘要在测试时模拟成对机器排序，从而能够给单个摘要赋予绝对分数。

Result: 在SummEval、TopicalChat和HANNA三个评测数据集上，该方法与最优成对评估器在轴平均样本级相关性上表现相似（分别为+0.03、-0.03和+0.05）。

Conclusion: 该直接评分方法能够在保持与成对比较方法相似性能的同时，提供绝对分数赋值能力，为需要阈值判断的应用场景提供了解决方案。

Abstract: As large-language models have been increasingly used as automatic raters for
evaluating free-form content, including document summarization, dialog, and
story generation, work has been dedicated to evaluating such models by
measuring their correlations with human judgment. For \textit{sample-level}
performance, methods which operate by using pairwise comparisons between
machine-generated text perform well but often lack the ability to assign
absolute scores to individual summaries, an ability crucial for use cases that
require thresholding. In this work, we propose a direct-scoring method which
uses synthetic summaries to act as pairwise machine rankings at test time. We
show that our method performs comparably to state-of-the-art pairwise
evaluators in terms of axis-averaged sample-level correlations on the SummEval
(\textbf{+0.03}), TopicalChat (\textbf{-0.03}), and HANNA (\textbf{+0.05})
meta-evaluation benchmarks, and release the synthetic in-context summaries as
data to facilitate future work.

Method: 提出多阶段LLM框架，评估包括推理、通用和轻量型多种LLM模型，并结合数据安全措施和HIPAA遵循要求。

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效利用员工消息数据，识别导航员培训机会，支持改善患者体验和护理质量。

Abstract: Hospital call centers serve as the primary contact point for patients within
a hospital system. They also generate substantial volumes of staff messages as
navigators process patient requests and communicate with the hospital offices
following the established protocol restrictions and guidelines. This
continuously accumulated large amount of text data can be mined and processed
to retrieve insights; however, traditional supervised learning approaches
require annotated data, extensive training, and model tuning. Large Language
Models (LLMs) offer a paradigm shift toward more computationally efficient
methodologies for healthcare analytics. This paper presents a multi-stage
LLM-based framework that identifies staff message topics and classifies
messages by their reasons in a multi-class fashion. In the process, multiple
LLM types, including reasoning, general-purpose, and lightweight models, were
evaluated. The best-performing model was o3, achieving 78.4% weighted F1-score
and 79.2% accuracy, followed closely by gpt-5 (75.3% Weighted F1-score and
76.2% accuracy). The proposed methodology incorporates data security measures
and HIPAA compliance requirements essential for healthcare environments. The
processed LLM outputs are integrated into a visualization decision support tool
that transforms the staff messages into actionable insights accessible to
healthcare professionals. This approach enables more efficient utilization of
the collected staff messaging data, identifies navigator training
opportunities, and supports improved patient experience and care quality.

Motivation: 解决词汇切分效率问题对形态复杂语言的不公平影响，量化词汇生育率与模型性能的关系，推动更公平的自然语言处理技术发展。

Method: 评估10个大语言模型在AfriMMLU数据集（9,000道多选题，5个科目，16种非洲语言）上的表现，分析词汇生育率与准确率的关联性，比较推理模型与非推理模型的性能差异。

Result: 词汇生育率越高，模型准确率越低；推理模型在所有语言上都优于非推理模型；词汇数量翻倍会导致训练成本和时间增加四倍。

Conclusion: 需要开发形态学感知的词汇切分方法、实施公平定价策略，并建立多语言基准测试，以实现更公平的自然语言处理。

Abstract: Tokenization inefficiency imposes structural disadvantages on morphologically
complex, low-resource languages, inflating compute resources and depressing
accuracy. We evaluate 10 large language models (LLMs) on AfriMMLU (9,000 MCQA
items; 5 subjects; 16 African languages) and show that fertility (tokens/word)
reliably predicts accuracy. Higher fertility consistently predicts lower
accuracy across all models and subjects. We further find that reasoning models
(DeepSeek, o1) consistently outperform non-reasoning peers across high and low
resource languages in the AfriMMLU dataset, narrowing accuracy gaps observed in
prior generations. Finally, translating token inflation to economics, a
doubling in tokens results in quadrupled training cost and time, underscoring
the token tax faced by many languages. These results motivate morphologically
aware tokenization, fair pricing, and multilingual benchmarks for equitable
natural language processing (NLP).

Abstract: This work presents a Biomedical Literature Question Answering (Q&A) system
based on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, designed to
improve access to accurate, evidence-based medical information. Addressing the
shortcomings of conventional health search engines and the lag in public access
to biomedical research, the system integrates diverse sources, including PubMed
articles, curated Q&A datasets, and medical encyclopedias ,to retrieve relevant
information and generate concise, context-aware responses. The retrieval
pipeline uses MiniLM-based semantic embeddings and FAISS vector search, while
answer generation is performed by a fine-tuned Mistral-7B-v0.3 language model
optimized using QLoRA for efficient, low-resource training. The system supports
both general medical queries and domain-specific tasks, with a focused
evaluation on breast cancer literature demonstrating the value of
domain-aligned retrieval. Empirical results, measured using BERTScore (F1),
show substantial improvements in factual consistency and semantic relevance
compared to baseline models. The findings underscore the potential of
RAG-enhanced language models to bridge the gap between complex biomedical
literature and accessible public health knowledge, paving the way for future
work on multilingual adaptation, privacy-preserving inference, and personalized
medical AI systems.

TL;DR: 这篇论文探讨了大语言模型是否真正理解概念还是仅仅识别模式的根本问题，提出双向推理作为真正理解的测试标准，并发现了细调导致的认知专门化问题，最终发展出对比细调方法来实现双向推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI领域的基本问题：大语言模型是否真正理解概念还是仅仅识别表面模式。作者认为真正的理解应该自然允许可逆反向的变换。

Method: 提出双向推理概念，并使用对比细调（CFT）方法，包含三类示例：保持语义的正示例、语义不同的负示例、以及前向隐藏示例。通过这种方式培养深层理解而非表面模式识别。

Result: 实验结果显示，当模型细调于前向任务时，对该任务的性能提升但反向推理能力显著下降（认知专门化）。CFT方法成功实现了双向推理，在保持前向任务能力的同时开发出强大的反向性能。

Conclusion: 双向推理既可作为评估真正理解的理论框架，也是开发更强大AI系统的实用训练方法。这个研究为构建具有深层理解能力的人工智能系统提供了重要的方向。

Abstract: This research addresses a fundamental question in AI: whether large language
models truly understand concepts or simply recognize patterns. The authors
propose bidirectional reasoning,the ability to apply transformations in both
directions without being explicitly trained on the reverse direction, as a test
for genuine understanding. They argue that true comprehension should naturally
allow reversibility. For example, a model that can change a variable name like
userIndex to i should also be able to infer that i represents a user index
without reverse training. The researchers tested current language models and
discovered what they term cognitive specialization: when models are fine-tuned
on forward tasks, their performance on those tasks improves, but their ability
to reason bidirectionally becomes significantly worse. To address this issue,
they developed Contrastive Fine-Tuning (CFT), which trains models using three
types of examples: positive examples that maintain semantic meaning, negative
examples with different semantics, and forward-direction obfuscation examples.
This approach aims to develop deeper understanding rather than surface-level
pattern recognition and allows reverse capabilities to develop naturally
without explicit reverse training. Their experiments demonstrated that CFT
successfully achieved bidirectional reasoning, enabling strong reverse
performance while maintaining forward task capabilities. The authors conclude
that bidirectional reasoning serves both as a theoretical framework for
assessing genuine understanding and as a practical training approach for
developing more capable AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人们如何为从未讨论过的事物建立共享命名系统，检验两种对立观点：一种是建立任意链接（如专有名词），另一种是通过概念对齐来重塑语义空间。

Method: 使用KiloGram数据集的1000多个抽象七巧板图像进行双人沟通研究（N=302），让参与者为图像集建立指称惯例，然后测量他们对未讨论图像的描述对齐程度。

Result: 发现了强烈的泛化证据：伙伴间的对齐程度相对于测试前标签显著增加；泛化随视觉相似性非线性衰减（符合Shepard定律）；在不同可命名性水平的图像上都表现稳健。

Conclusion: 临时约定不是任意标签，而是反映了真正的概念协调，这对指称理论和设计更具适应性的语言代理具有重要意义。

suggests that a new shared naming system establishes an arbitrary link to a
specific target, like proper names that cannot extend beyond their bearers. An
alternative view proposes that forming a shared way of describing objects
involves broader conceptual alignment, reshaping each individual's semantic
space in ways that should generalize to new referents. We test these competing
accounts in a dyadic communication study (N=302) leveraging the
recently-released KiloGram dataset containing over 1,000 abstract tangram
images. After pairs of participants coordinated on referential conventions for
one set of images through repeated communication, we measured the extent to
which their descriptions aligned for undiscussed images. We found strong
evidence for generalization: partners showed increased alignment relative to
their pre-test labels. Generalization also decayed nonlinearly with visual
similarity (consistent with Shepard's law) and was robust across levels of the
images' nameability. These findings suggest that ad hoc conventions are not
arbitrary labels but reflect genuine conceptual coordination, with implications
for theories of reference and the design of more adaptive language agents.

TL;DR: CoPeD方法通过引入正确性感知任务设置和加权损失函数，提升小语言模型从大语言模型生成的思维链数据中学习推理质量的能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型通过微调大语言模型生成的思维链数据来复制推理能力，但这些数据可能包含噪声推理，导致模型学习到虚假的相关性，影响推理质量

Method: 提出Chain-of-Thought Correctness Perception Distillation (CoPeD)：1) 正确性感知任务设置，鼓励模型基于正确推理预测答案并修正错误推理；2) 正确性感知加权损失，根据推理和答案的联合损失动态调整训练样本权重

Result: 在分布内和分布外基准推理数据集上实验证明CoPeD方法有效

Conclusion: CoPeD通过改进任务设置和数据利用方式，有效提升了学生模型的推理质量，特别是在处理噪声推理数据方面表现出色

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning tasks but are expensive to
deploy. Thus small language models (SLMs) are fine-tuned on CoT data generated
by LLMs to copy LLMs' abilities. However, these CoT data may include noisy
rationales that either fail to substantiate the answers or contribute no
additional information to support answer prediction, which leads SLMs to
capture spurious correlations between questions and answers and compromise the
quality of reasoning. In this work, we propose Chain-of-Thought Correctness
Perception Distillation (CoPeD), which aims to improve the reasoning quality of
the student model from the perspectives of task setting and data utilization.
Firstly, we introduce a correctness-aware task setting that encourages the
student model to predict answers based on correct rationales and revise them
when they are incorrect. This setting improves the faithfulness of reasoning
and allows the model to learn from its mistakes. Then, we propose a
Correctness-Aware Weighted loss, which dynamically adjusts the contribution of
each training instance based on the combined loss of the rationale and the
answer. This strategy encourages the model to focus more on samples where the
rationale offers stronger support for the correct answer. Experiments have
shown that CoPeD is effective on both in-distribution (IND) and
out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmark reasoning datasets.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注文本数据，忽略了对话系统中重要的结构信息（如查询-查询关系和查询-回答关系），导致意图检测效果受限。

Method: 提出SAID框架，统一整合文本和关系结构信息进行预训练；设计查询自适应注意力网络(QueryAdapt)，在关系标记级别生成意图特定的关系标记，实现细粒度知识迁移。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上的大量实验结果表明，SAID显著优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 整合文本和关系结构信息能够有效提升少样本意图检测性能，QueryAdapt机制实现了更细粒度的知识迁移。

Abstract: Intent detection is a crucial component of modern conversational systems,
since accurately identifying user intent at the beginning of a conversation is
essential for generating effective responses. Recent efforts have focused on
studying this problem under a challenging few-shot scenario. These approaches
primarily leverage large-scale unlabeled dialogue text corpora to pretrain
language models through various pretext tasks, followed by fine-tuning for
intent detection with very limited annotations. Despite the improvements
achieved, existing methods have predominantly focused on textual data,
neglecting to effectively capture the crucial structural information inherent
in conversational systems, such as the query-query relation and query-answer
relation. To address this gap, we propose SAID, a novel framework that
integrates both textual and relational structure information in a unified
manner for model pretraining for the first time. Building on this framework, we
further propose a novel mechanism, the query-adaptive attention network
(QueryAdapt), which operates at the relation token level by generating
intent-specific relation tokens from well-learned query-query and query-answer
relations explicitly, enabling more fine-grained knowledge transfer. Extensive
experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that SAID
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 传统偏好数据集构建方法存在两个主要问题：依赖预收集指令导致与目标模型分布不匹配，以及需要采样多个随机响应带来巨大计算开销。

Method: 1) 提取层级方向向量编码人类偏好；2) 基于内在一致性过滤自合成指令；3) 在解码时应用双向内在控制来引导token表示，精确生成具有明确对齐区分的响应对。

Result: Llama3-8B和Qwen2-7B在AlpacaEval 2.0上平均胜率提升13.89%，在Arena-Hard上提升13.45%，同时计算成本降低高达48.1%。

Conclusion: Icon²通过利用LLM表示空间的内在调节，实现了高效且定制化的偏好数据集构建，在提升对齐效果的同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require high quality preference datasets to
align with human preferences. However, conventional methods for constructing
such datasets face significant challenges: reliance on pre-collected
instructions often leads to distribution mismatches with target models, while
the need for sampling multiple stochastic responses introduces substantial
computational overhead. In this work, we explore a paradigm shift by leveraging
inherent regulation of LLMs' representation space for efficient and tailored
preference dataset construction, named Icon$^{2}$. Specifically, it first
extracts layer-wise direction vectors to encode sophisticated human preferences
and then uses these vectors to filter self-synthesized instructions based on
their inherent consistency. During decoding, bidirectional inherent control is
applied to steer token representations, enabling the precise generation of
response pairs with clear alignment distinctions. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements in both alignment and efficiency.
Llama3-8B and Qwen2-7B achieve an average win rate improvement of 13.89% on
AlpacaEval 2.0 and 13.45% on Arena-Hard, while reducing computational costs by
up to 48.1%.

Engines has rendered conventional SEO metrics obsolete, creating an urgent need
to understand, measure, and optimize for content influence on synthesized

Generative Search Engine Optimization (GSEO) to address this challenge. We make
two primary contributions. First, we construct CC-GSEO-Bench, a large-scale,
content-centric benchmark, and propose a multi-dimensional evaluation framework
that systematically quantifies influence, moving beyond surface-level
attribution to assess substantive semantic impact. Second, we design a novel
multi-agent system that operationalizes this framework, automating the
strategic refinement of content through a collaborative analyze-revise-evaluate
workflow. Our empirical analysis using this framework reveals novel insights
into the dynamics of content influence, offering actionable strategies for
creators and establishing a principled foundation for future GSEO research.

Motivation: 解决语音识别中声学和语言表征对齐的核心挑战，特别是多对一、一对多的结构性不对称关系，以及噪声或默声导致的不平衡匹配条件。

Method: 将对齐问题视为检测问题，提出基于不平衡最三运输的对齐模型，支持软匹配和部分匹配，确保每个语言标注都有至少一个声学观测基础，同时允许灵活的概率映射。

Result: 在基于CTC的ASR系统中进行实验，结果表明该方法能够灵活控制匹配程度，有效提升语音识别性能。

Conclusion: 通过将对齐问题重构为检测问题，使用不平衡最优运输模型，能够有效处理声学-语言表征间的结构性不对称和分布不匹配问题，为ASR知识转移提供了有效的对齐方法。

Abstract: Aligning acoustic and linguistic representations is a central challenge to
bridge the pre-trained models in knowledge transfer for automatic speech
recognition (ASR). This alignment is inherently structured and asymmetric:
while multiple consecutive acoustic frames typically correspond to a single
linguistic token (many-to-one), certain acoustic transition regions may relate
to multiple adjacent tokens (one-to-many). Moreover, acoustic sequences often
include frames with no linguistic counterpart, such as background noise or
silence may lead to imbalanced matching conditions. In this work, we take a new
insight to regard alignment and matching as a detection problem, where the goal
is to identify meaningful correspondences with high precision and recall
ensuring full coverage of linguistic tokens while flexibly handling redundant
or noisy acoustic frames in transferring linguistic knowledge for ASR. Based on
this new insight, we propose an unbalanced optimal transport-based alignment
model that explicitly handles distributional mismatch and structural
asymmetries with soft and partial matching between acoustic and linguistic
modalities. Our method ensures that every linguistic token is grounded in at
least one acoustic observation, while allowing for flexible, probabilistic
mappings from acoustic to linguistic units. We evaluate our proposed model with
experiments on an CTC-based ASR system with a pre-trained language model for
knowledge transfer. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in flexibly controlling degree of matching and hence to improve ASR
performance.

Abstract: The emotional content of song lyrics plays a pivotal role in shaping listener
experiences and influencing musical preferences. This paper investigates the
task of multi-label emotional attribution of song lyrics by predicting six
emotional intensity scores corresponding to six fundamental emotions. A
manually labeled dataset is constructed using a mean opinion score (MOS)
approach, which aggregates annotations from multiple human raters to ensure
reliable ground-truth labels. Leveraging this dataset, we conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of several publicly available large language models
(LLMs) under zero-shot scenarios. Additionally, we fine-tune a BERT-based model
specifically for predicting multi-label emotion scores. Experimental results
reveal the relative strengths and limitations of zero-shot and fine-tuned
models in capturing the nuanced emotional content of lyrics. Our findings
highlight the potential of LLMs for emotion recognition in creative texts,
providing insights into model selection strategies for emotion-based music
information retrieval applications. The labeled dataset is available at

Motivation: 现有RAG系统的粗排序优化方法难以平衡领域特定知识学习和查询增强，导致检索性能不佳

Method: 两阶段流程：1）使用混合损失（MoL）进行持续预训练，平衡领域知识和通用语言能力；2）使用组相对策略优化（GRPO）进行强化学习，优化查询和段落生成以最大化文档召回率。创新点包括多查询单段落后期融合（MSLF）策略

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，MoLER实现了最先进的性能，显著优于基线方法

Conclusion: MoLER填补了RAG系统中的知识空白，能够在专业领域实现鲁棒且可扩展的检索

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely heavily on the retrieval
stage, particularly the coarse-ranking process. Existing coarse-ranking
optimization approaches often struggle to balance domain-specific knowledge
learning with query enhencement, resulting in suboptimal retrieval performance.
To address this challenge, we propose MoLER, a domain-aware RAG method that
uses MoL-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning to optimize retrieval. MoLER has a
two-stage pipeline: a continual pre-training (CPT) phase using a Mixture of
Losses (MoL) to balance domain-specific knowledge with general language
capabilities, and a reinforcement learning (RL) phase leveraging Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) to optimize query and passage generation for
maximizing document recall. A key innovation is our Multi-query Single-passage
Late Fusion (MSLF) strategy, which reduces computational overhead during RL
training while maintaining scalable inference via Multi-query Multi-passage
Late Fusion (MMLF). Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that MoLER
achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming baseline
methods. MoLER bridges the knowledge gap in RAG systems, enabling robust and
scalable retrieval in specialized domains.

Abstract: Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new avenues for
solving complex optimization problems, including Neural Architecture Search
(NAS). However, existing LLM-driven NAS approaches rely heavily on prompt
engineering and domain-specific tuning, limiting their practicality and
scalability across diverse tasks. In this work, we propose LM-Searcher, a novel
framework that leverages LLMs for cross-domain neural architecture optimization
without the need for extensive domain-specific adaptation. Central to our
approach is NCode, a universal numerical string representation for neural
architectures, which enables cross-domain architecture encoding and search. We
also reformulate the NAS problem as a ranking task, training LLMs to select
high-performing architectures from candidate pools using instruction-tuning
samples derived from a novel pruning-based subspace sampling strategy. Our
curated dataset, encompassing a wide range of architecture-performance pairs,
encourages robust and transferable learning. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that LM-Searcher achieves competitive performance in both in-domain
(e.g., CNNs for image classification) and out-of-domain (e.g., LoRA
configurations for segmentation and generation) tasks, establishing a new
paradigm for flexible and generalizable LLM-based architecture search. The

Abstract: Encoder-only languages models are frequently used for a variety of standard
machine learning tasks, including classification and retrieval. However, there
has been a lack of recent research for encoder models, especially with respect
to multilingual models. We introduce mmBERT, an encoder-only language model
pretrained on 3T tokens of multilingual text in over 1800 languages. To build
mmBERT we introduce several novel elements, including an inverse mask ratio
schedule and an inverse temperature sampling ratio. We add over 1700
low-resource languages to the data mix only during the decay phase, showing
that it boosts performance dramatically and maximizes the gains from the
relatively small amount of training data. Despite only including these
low-resource languages in the short decay phase we achieve similar
classification performance to models like OpenAI's o3 and Google's Gemini 2.5
Pro. Overall, we show that mmBERT significantly outperforms the previous
generation of models on classification and retrieval tasks -- on both high and
low-resource languages.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种扩展LLM方法重用范围的新方法，能够处理低相似度或具有隐藏相似性的问题，通过分离问题和解决方案来指导LLM进行解决方案迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法重用通常要求问题高度相似，限制了应用范围。本文旨在扩展方法重用的适用范围，使其能够处理相似度较低或具有隐藏相似性的问题。

Method: 首先将问题和解决方案分离，而不是直接将问题-解决方案对输入LLM。然后指导LLM将解决方案适配到新的相关问题上，专注于解决方案迁移而非问题识别。还扩展到仅共享部分特征或隐藏特征的情况。

Result: 实验验证表明，该范围扩展方法提高了筛选出可重用解决方案的概率，从而提升了跨问题方法重用的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功突破了传统相似性约束，实现了更广泛的跨问题方法重用，为LLM在复杂问题解决中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely applied to assist in finding
solutions for diverse questions. Prior work has proposed representing a method
as a pair of a question and its corresponding solution, enabling method reuse.
However, existing approaches typically require the questions to be highly
similar. In this paper, we extend the scope of method reuse to address
questions with low similarity or with hidden similarities that are not
explicitly observable. For questions that are similar in a general-specific
sense (i.e., broader or narrower in scope), we propose to first separate the
question and solution, rather than directly feeding the pair to the LLM. The
LLM is then guided to adapt the solution to new but related questions, allowing
it to focus on solution transfer rather than question recognition. Furthermore,
we extend this approach to cases where questions only share partial features or
hidden characteristics. This enables cross-question method reuse beyond
conventional similarity constraints. Experimental verification shows that our
scope-extension approach increases the probability of filtering out reusable
solutions, thereby improving the effectiveness of cross-question method reuse.

Abstract: We present Llama-GENBA-10B, a trilingual foundation model addressing

to 10B parameters, Llama-GENBA-10B is continuously pretrained on 164B tokens
(82B English, 82B German, and 80M Bavarian), balancing resources while
preventing English dominance. Targeted at the German NLP community, the model
also promotes Bavarian as a low-resource language. Development tackled four
challenges: (1) curating a multilingual corpus despite Bavarian scarcity, (2)
creating a unified tokenizer for English, German, and Bavarian, (3) optimizing
architecture and language-ratio hyperparameters for cross-lingual transfer, and
(4) establishing the first standardized trilingual evaluation suite by
translating German benchmarks into Bavarian. Evaluations show that
Llama-GENBA-10B achieves strong cross-lingual performance, with the fine-tuned
variant surpassing Apertus-8B-2509 and gemma-2-9b in Bavarian and establishing
itself as the best model in its class for this language, while also
outperforming EuroLLM in English and matching its results in German. Training
on the Cerebras CS-2 demonstrated efficient large-scale multilingual
pretraining with documented energy use, offering a blueprint for inclusive
foundation models that integrate low-resource languages.

Result: 发现这13个文本嵌入模型通常无法准确捐描数值细节，数值认知能力弱

Conclusion: 文本嵌入模型在数值编码方面存在显著短板，需要进一步研究提升模型的数值处理能力以支持更多数值关键的NLP应用

Abstract: Text embedding models are widely used in natural language processing
applications. However, their capability is often benchmarked on tasks that do
not require understanding nuanced numerical information in text. As a result,
it remains unclear whether current embedding models can precisely encode
numerical content, such as numbers, into embeddings. This question is critical
because embedding models are increasingly applied in domains where numbers
matter, such as finance and healthcare. For example, Company X's market share
grew by 2\% should be interpreted very differently from Company X's market
share grew by 20\%, even though both indicate growth in market share. This
study aims to examine whether text embedding models can capture such nuances.
Using synthetic data in a financial context, we evaluate 13 widely used text
embedding models and find that they generally struggle to capture numerical
details accurately. Our further analyses provide deeper insights into embedding
numeracy, informing future research to strengthen embedding model-based NLP
systems with improved capacity for handling numerical content.

Abstract: Conversational Question Answering (ConvQA) systems have emerged as a pivotal
area within Natural Language Processing (NLP) by driving advancements that
enable machines to engage in dynamic and context-aware conversations. These
capabilities are increasingly being applied across various domains, i.e.,
customer support, education, legal, and healthcare where maintaining a coherent

survey provides a comprehensive analysis of the state-of-the-art in ConvQA.
This survey begins by examining the core components of ConvQA systems, i.e.,
history selection, question understanding, and answer prediction, highlighting
their interplay in ensuring coherence and relevance in multi-turn
conversations. It further investigates the use of advanced machine learning
techniques, including but not limited to, reinforcement learning, contrastive
learning, and transfer learning to improve ConvQA accuracy and efficiency. The
pivotal role of large language models, i.e., RoBERTa, GPT-4, Gemini 2.0 Flash,

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文对法尔语在主观性NLP任务中的真实资源状况进行了批判性分析，发现虽然数字文本数量不断增长，但数据集的可用性、质量和稳定性存在重大问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然法尔语被标签为中等资源语言，但研究者们发现在主观性NLP任务中存在显著的数据资源问题，需要更详细的评估

Method: 综述110篇关于法尔语主观性任务的研究论文，分析了情感分析、情绪分析和毒性检测三个任务领域的数据集可用性、质量和人口统计因素

Result: 发现公开数据集缺乏，现有数据集缺少关键人口统计信息，预测模型在不同数据集和模型间表现很不稳定

Conclusion: 纯粹的数据量增长不能有效提升语言在NLP领域的发展前景，需要更重视数据质量、多样性和可用性

Abstract: Given Farsi's speaker base of over 127 million people and the growing
availability of digital text, including more than 1.3 million articles on
Wikipedia, it is considered a middle-resource language. However, this label
quickly crumbles when the situation is examined more closely. We focus on three
subjective tasks (Sentiment Analysis, Emotion Analysis, and Toxicity Detection)
and find significant challenges in data availability and quality, despite the
overall increase in data availability. We review 110 publications on subjective
tasks in Farsi and observe a lack of publicly available datasets. Furthermore,
existing datasets often lack essential demographic factors, such as age and
gender, that are crucial for accurately modeling subjectivity in language. When
evaluating prediction models using the few available datasets, the results are
highly unstable across both datasets and models. Our findings indicate that the
volume of data is insufficient to significantly improve a language's prospects
in NLP.

TL;DR: 提出了一种预训练的量子上下文敏感嵌入模型QCSE，利用量子计算特性捕捉自然语言中的上下文关系，通过五种不同的上下文矩阵计算方法实现量子原生上下文学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用量子计算的独特优势来编码和理解自然语言的复杂性，特别是解决低资源语言数据不足的问题，为自然语言处理提供新的量子计算方法。

Method: 开发了QCSE模型，采用量子原生上下文学习，提出了五种上下文矩阵计算方法（指数衰减、正弦调制、相位偏移、哈希变换等），在富拉尼语和英语语料上进行评估。

Result: QCSE成功捕捉了上下文敏感性，并利用量子系统的表达能力来表示丰富的上下文感知语言信息，特别是在低资源富拉尼语上表现出色。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了量子计算在自然语言处理中的强大潜力，为将QNLP应用于现实世界语言挑战开辟了新途径，特别是在处理低资源语言方面具有重要价值。

Abstract: Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) offers a novel approach to
encoding and understanding the complexity of natural languages through the
power of quantum computation. This paper presents a pretrained quantum
context-sensitive embedding model, called QCSE, that captures context-sensitive
word embeddings, leveraging the unique properties of quantum systems to learn
contextual relationships in languages. The model introduces quantum-native
context learning, enabling the utilization of quantum computers for linguistic
tasks. Central to the proposed approach are innovative context matrix
computation methods, designed to create unique, representations of words based
on their surrounding linguistic context. Five distinct methods are proposed and
tested for computing the context matrices, incorporating techniques such as
exponential decay, sinusoidal modulation, phase shifts, and hash-based
transformations. These methods ensure that the quantum embeddings retain
context sensitivity, thereby making them suitable for downstream language tasks
where the expressibility and properties of quantum systems are valuable
resources. To evaluate the effectiveness of the model and the associated
context matrix methods, evaluations are conducted on both a Fulani corpus, a
low-resource African language, dataset of small size and an English corpus of
slightly larger size. The results demonstrate that QCSE not only captures
context sensitivity but also leverages the expressibility of quantum systems
for representing rich, context-aware language information. The use of Fulani
further highlights the potential of QNLP to mitigate the problem of lack of
data for this category of languages. This work underscores the power of quantum
computation in natural language processing (NLP) and opens new avenues for
applying QNLP to real-world linguistic challenges across various tasks and
domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在生成复杂事实敏感内容时普遍存在的幻觉问题和缺乏可信引用来源的问题。

Method: 采用多阶段的'事实验证-反思-引用集成'机制，使LLM能够批判性地自我检查和修订其中间推理步骤和最终答案。

Result: 显著提高了生成输出的客观准确性、可信度和可追溯性。

Conclusion: 该方法使LLM在需要高保真度的应用（如科学研究、新闻报道和法律咨询）中更加可靠。

Abstract: This research introduces VeriFact-CoT (Verified Factual Chain-of-Thought), a
novel method designed to address the pervasive issues of hallucination and the
absence of credible citation sources in Large Language Models (LLMs) when
generating complex, fact-sensitive content. By incorporating a multi-stage
mechanism of 'fact verification-reflection-citation integration,' VeriFact-CoT
empowers LLMs to critically self-examine and revise their intermediate
reasoning steps and final answers. This process significantly enhances the
objective accuracy, trustworthiness, and traceability of the generated outputs,
making LLMs more reliable for applications demanding high fidelity such as
scientific research, news reporting, and legal consultation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨语言语音转换中说话人身份特征保持的问题，特别是在英语和罗曼语系语言之间，重点针对葡萄牙语。

Method: 采用12层仅解码器Transformer架构，分三阶段训练：文本到音频映射预训练、零样本语音克隆监督微调、基于词错误率和说话人相似度指标的DPO对齐优化。

Result: 相比基线模型，LatinX在DPO优化后持续降低词错误率并改善客观相似度指标。人工评估显示其感知说话人相似度优于强基线XTTSv2。

Conclusion: LatinX在跨语言说话人身份保持方面表现优异，但存在客观与主观评估间的差距，未来工作将关注平衡偏好信号和低延迟架构。

Abstract: We present LatinX, a multilingual text-to-speech (TTS) model for cascaded
speech-to-speech translation that preserves the source speaker's identity
across languages. LatinX is a 12-layer decoder-only Transformer trained in
three stages: (i) pre-training for text-to-audio mapping, (ii) supervised
fine-tuning for zero-shot voice cloning, and (iii) alignment with Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) using automatically labeled pairs based on Word
Error Rate (WER) and speaker-similarity metrics. Trained on English and Romance
languages with emphasis on Portuguese, LatinX with DPO consistently reduces WER
and improves objective similarity over the fine-tuned baseline. Human
evaluations further indicate stronger perceived speaker similarity than a
strong baseline (XTTSv2), revealing gaps between objective and subjective
measures. We provide cross-lingual analyses and discuss balanced preference
signals and lower-latency architectures as future work.

Method: 提出ZhiFangDanTai框架，结合图基检索增强生成(GraphRAG)和大语言模型细调，通过GraphRAG检索结构化中医知识并生成简洁摘要，构建增强指令数据集提升LLM整合检索信息的能力

Result: 在收集和临床数据集上的实验结果显示，ZhiFangDanTai在中医方剂任务中较现有最佳模型取得显著提升，并提供理论证明能够降低模型的推广错误和幻觉率

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了中医方剂生成中的信息不完整问题，通过GraphRAG与LLM细调的结合，提供了更完整、详细的方剂解释输出，为中医智能化研究提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formulas play a significant role in
treating epidemics and complex diseases. Existing models for TCM utilize
traditional algorithms or deep learning techniques to analyze formula
relationships, yet lack comprehensive results, such as complete formula
compositions and detailed explanations. Although recent efforts have used TCM
instruction datasets to fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) for explainable
formula generation, existing datasets lack sufficient details, such as the
roles of the formula's sovereign, minister, assistant, courier; efficacy;
contraindications; tongue and pulse diagnosis-limiting the depth of model
outputs. To address these challenges, we propose ZhiFangDanTai, a framework
combining Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) with LLM
fine-tuning. ZhiFangDanTai uses GraphRAG to retrieve and synthesize structured
TCM knowledge into concise summaries, while also constructing an enhanced
instruction dataset to improve LLMs' ability to integrate retrieved
information. Furthermore, we provide novel theoretical proofs demonstrating
that integrating GraphRAG with fine-tuning techniques can reduce generalization
error and hallucination rates in the TCM formula task. Experimental results on
both collected and clinical datasets demonstrate that ZhiFangDanTai achieves
significant improvements over state-of-the-art models. Our model is
open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/tczzx6/ZhiFangDanTai1.0.

Motivation: 大型语言模型生成的临床文本事实准确性评估是临床应用的关键障碍，专家评审无法满足持续质量保证的可扩展性需求。

Method: MedFactEval框架：临床医生定义关键事实，LLM评审团（多LLM多数投票）评估生成摘要中的事实包含情况；MedAgentBrief：模型无关的多步骤工作流生成高质量出院摘要。

Result: MedFactEval LLM评审团与七名医生专家组的金标准达成几乎完美一致（Cohen's kappa=81%），统计上不劣于单个人类专家（kappa=67%，P<0.001）。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了稳健的评估框架和高性能生成工作流，为生成式AI在临床工作流程中的负责任部署提供了全面解决方案。

Abstract: Evaluating factual accuracy in Large Language Model (LLM)-generated clinical
text is a critical barrier to adoption, as expert review is unscalable for the
continuous quality assurance these systems require. We address this challenge
with two complementary contributions. First, we introduce MedFactEval, a
framework for scalable, fact-grounded evaluation where clinicians define
high-salience key facts and an "LLM Jury"--a multi-LLM majority vote--assesses
their inclusion in generated summaries. Second, we present MedAgentBrief, a
model-agnostic, multi-step workflow designed to generate high-quality, factual
discharge summaries. To validate our evaluation framework, we established a
gold-standard reference using a seven-physician majority vote on
clinician-defined key facts from inpatient cases. The MedFactEval LLM Jury
achieved almost perfect agreement with this panel (Cohen's kappa=81%), a
performance statistically non-inferior to that of a single human expert
(kappa=67%, P < 0.001). Our work provides both a robust evaluation framework
(MedFactEval) and a high-performing generation workflow (MedAgentBrief),
offering a comprehensive approach to advance the responsible deployment of
generative AI in clinical workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM越来越多地作为人类协作伙伴，需要确保其在多轮交互中的行为可预测且可靠。现有对齐技术主要针对单用户场景，缺乏对多方长期交互动态的考虑。

Method: 使用角色扮演方法评估不同训练方式的摩擦代理在协作任务对话中的干预效果，提出了量化摩擦干预如何改变群体协作轨迹和信念对齐的反事实评估框架。

Result: 摩擦感知方法在帮助群体达成共识（共同认可的任务相关命题）和任务结果正确性方面显著优于常见对齐基线方法。

Conclusion: 针对多轮多方协作场景设计的摩擦感知对齐方法比传统单用户对齐技术更有效，能够更好地促进群体决策的深思熟虑和共识形成。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) integrate into diverse workflows, they are
increasingly being considered "collaborators" with humans. If such AI
collaborators are to be reliable, their behavior over multiturn interactions
must be predictable, validated and verified before deployment. Common alignment
techniques are typically developed under simplified single-user settings and do
not account for the dynamics of long-horizon multiparty interactions. This
paper examines how different alignment methods affect LLM agents' effectiveness
as partners in multiturn, multiparty collaborations. We study this question
through the lens of friction agents that intervene in group dialogues to
encourage the collaborative group to slow down and reflect upon their reasoning
for deliberative decision-making. Using a roleplay methodology, we evaluate
interventions from differently-trained friction agents in collaborative task
conversations. We propose a novel counterfactual evaluation framework that
quantifies how friction interventions change the trajectory of group
collaboration and belief alignment. Our results show that a friction-aware
approach significantly outperforms common alignment baselines in helping both
convergence to a common ground, or agreed-upon task-relevant propositions, and
correctness of task outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决交叉注意力模型在长偏置列表下效果下降的问题，因为无论偏置列表长度如何，只有少量偏置信息与ASR中间表征最相关

Method: 提出PSC-Joint方法，定义三级语义相关性（列表级、短语级、词汇级）并聚合模型，通过组化竞争筛选机制清除无关偏置短语

Result: 在AISHELL-1和KeSpeech数据集上对不同长度偏置列表实现了平均相对F1分数提升21.34%和28.46%

Conclusion: 通过多级别语义相关性聚合模型和筛选机制，可以有效提升上下文ASR模型的性能和效率

Abstract: Recently, cross-attention-based contextual automatic speech recognition (ASR)
models have made notable advancements in recognizing personalized biasing
phrases. However, the effectiveness of cross-attention is affected by
variations in biasing information volume, especially when the length of the
biasing list increases significantly. We find that, regardless of the length of
the biasing list, only a limited amount of biasing information is most relevant
to a specific ASR intermediate representation. Therefore, by identifying and
integrating the most relevant biasing information rather than the entire
biasing list, we can alleviate the effects of variations in biasing information
volume for contextual ASR. To this end, we propose a purified semantic
correlation joint modeling (PSC-Joint) approach. In PSC-Joint, we define and
calculate three semantic correlations between the ASR intermediate
representations and biasing information from coarse to fine: list-level,
phrase-level, and token-level. Then, the three correlations are jointly modeled
to produce their intersection, so that the most relevant biasing information
across various granularities is highlighted and integrated for contextual
recognition. In addition, to reduce the computational cost introduced by the
joint modeling of three semantic correlations, we also propose a purification
mechanism based on a grouped-and-competitive strategy to filter out irrelevant
biasing phrases. Compared with baselines, our PSC-Joint approach achieves
average relative F1 score improvements of up to 21.34% on AISHELL-1 and 28.46%
on KeSpeech, across biasing lists of varying lengths.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型计算成本高，适应性计算方法如提前退出虽能节省计算，但在批处理推理中反而导致系统性能瓶颈，减少吞吐量。

Method: 1）提出高效并行解码机制减少传统提前退出的开销 2）利甦深度参数共享架构缩减模型参数数量并缓解同步问题 3）预训练轻量路由器动态分配每个token的最佳递归深度

Result: 建立了效率与性能之间的新帕紅托边界，在单个模型中同时优化了适应性计算和参数效率。

Conclusion: 通过算法与架构的协同设计，成功解决了动态计算与系统效率之间的冲突，为大语言模型的实际部署提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable capabilities, but their
practical deployment is hindered by significant computational costs. While
adaptive computation methods like early-exiting promise to reduce these costs,
they introduce a fundamental conflict: the per-token dynamism intended to save
computation often creates system-level bottlenecks that can paradoxically
reduce throughput in batched inference. This dissertation resolves this
conflict by co-designing adaptive algorithms and model architectures to strike
an optimal balance between dynamism and efficiency. To this end, our work first
addresses critical sources of overhead in conventional early-exiting by
proposing an efficient parallel decoding mechanism. We then show that deep
parameter sharing provides an architectural foundation that not only yields
compact, parameter-efficient models but also inherently mitigates the critical
synchronization issues affecting dynamic inference. Finally, this work presents
a unified framework where lightweight routers are pretrained to dynamically
assign an optimal recursion depth for each token. This approach establishes a
new Pareto frontier between efficiency and performance by effectively
optimizing for both adaptive computation and parameter efficiency within a
single model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM真实性评估基准主要针对英语，缺乏对低资源语言的评估，限制了LLM在多语言环境中的可靠应用。

Method: 将TruthfulQA基准翻译成菲律宾语(KatotohananQA)，使用二元选择框架评估7个免费专有模型，比较英语和菲律宾语版本的表现差异。

Result: 发现英语和菲律宾语真实性表现存在显著差距；新版OpenAI模型(GPT-5和GPT-5 mini)展现较强的多语言鲁棒性；不同问题类型、类别和主题的跨语言迁移鲁棒性存在差异。

Conclusion: 需要更广泛的多语言评估来确保LLM使用的公平性和可靠性，某些问题类型在多语言迁移中表现较弱，凸显了多语言基准的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across various
tasks, but their tendency to produce hallucinations limits reliable adoption.
Benchmarks such as TruthfulQA have been developed to measure truthfulness, yet
they are primarily available in English, leaving a gap in evaluating LLMs in
low-resource languages. To address this, we present KatotohananQA, a Filipino
translation of the TruthfulQA benchmark. Seven free-tier proprietary models
were assessed using a binary-choice framework. Findings show a significant
performance gap between English and Filipino truthfulness, with newer OpenAI
models (GPT-5 and GPT-5 mini) demonstrating strong multilingual robustness.
Results also reveal disparities across question characteristics, suggesting
that some question types, categories, and topics are less robust to
multilingual transfer which highlight the need for broader multilingual
evaluation to ensure fairness and reliability in LLM usage.

Result: 在DailyTalk数据集上的实验表明，MFCIG-CSS在韵律表达性方面优于所有基线模型

Conclusion: 提出的多模态细粒度上下文交互图方法有效提升了对话语音合成的自然韵律表达性能

Abstract: Conversational Speech Synthesis (CSS) aims to generate speech with natural
prosody by understanding the multimodal dialogue history (MDH). The latest work
predicts the accurate prosody expression of the target utterance by modeling
the utterance-level interaction characteristics of MDH and the target
utterance. However, MDH contains fine-grained semantic and prosody knowledge at
the word level. Existing methods overlook the fine-grained semantic and
prosodic interaction modeling. To address this gap, we propose MFCIG-CSS, a
novel Multimodal Fine-grained Context Interaction Graph-based CSS system. Our
approach constructs two specialized multimodal fine-grained dialogue
interaction graphs: a semantic interaction graph and a prosody interaction
graph. These two interaction graphs effectively encode interactions between
word-level semantics, prosody, and their influence on subsequent utterances in
MDH. The encoded interaction features are then leveraged to enhance synthesized
speech with natural conversational prosody. Experiments on the DailyTalk
dataset demonstrate that MFCIG-CSS outperforms all baseline models in terms of
prosodic expressiveness. Code and speech samples are available at

Motivation: 现有参数正则化方法如O-LoRA和N-LoRA通过强制低秩子空间正交性来缓解任务干扰，但忽视了传统加法微调会破坏LLM参数的内在几何结构，限制了性能。

Method: 提出OLieRA方法，将李群理论引入LLM微调：利用乘法更新来保持参数几何结构，同时对任务子空间应用正交约束。

Result: 实验表明OLieRA在标准持续学习基准上达到最先进结果，在大量任务设置中保持顶级性能。

Conclusion: 保持参数空间的几何结构对于LLM的连续学习至关重要，OLieRA通过结合李群理论和正交约束有效解决了灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are prone to catastrophic forgetting in
sequential multi-task settings. Parameter regularization methods such as O-LoRA
and N-LoRA alleviate task interference by enforcing low-rank subspace
orthogonality, but they overlook the fact that conventional additive
fine-tuning disrupts the intrinsic geometric structure of LLM parameters,
limiting performance. Our key insight is that the parameter space of LLMs
possesses a geometric structure, which must be preserved in addition to
enforcing orthogonality. Based on this, we propose Orthogonal Low-rank
Adaptation in Lie Groups (OLieRA), which introduces Lie group theory into LLM
fine-tuning: leveraging multiplicative updates to preserve parameter geometry
while applying orthogonality constraints to task subspaces. Experiments
demonstrate that OLieRA achieves state-of-the-art results on the Standard CL
benchmark and remains among the top-performing methods in the Large Number of
Tasks setting.

Method: 创建EuroParlVote数据集，包含欧氲议会辩论演讲与投票结果的关联，以及MEP的人口统计元数据，通过性别分类和投票预测两个任务评估LLM

Result: LLM经常将女性MEP误分为男性，对女性演讲者的投票模拟准确性下降，政治上偏向中间派别而在极左极右派别表现较差，GPT-4o等专有模型在稳健性和公平性方面更优

Conclusion: 大语言模型在政治领域存在显著的偏见问题，需要更多研究来提高NLP在政治上下文中的公平性和负责性

Abstract: We introduce EuroParlVote, a novel benchmark for evaluating large language
models (LLMs) in politically sensitive contexts. It links European Parliament
debate speeches to roll-call vote outcomes and includes rich demographic
metadata for each Member of the European Parliament (MEP), such as gender, age,
country, and political group. Using EuroParlVote, we evaluate state-of-the-art
LLMs on two tasks -- gender classification and vote prediction -- revealing
consistent patterns of bias. We find that LLMs frequently misclassify female
MEPs as male and demonstrate reduced accuracy when simulating votes for female
speakers. Politically, LLMs tend to favor centrist groups while underperforming
on both far-left and far-right ones. Proprietary models like GPT-4o outperform
open-weight alternatives in terms of both robustness and fairness. We release
the EuroParlVote dataset, code, and demo to support future research on fairness
and accountability in NLP within political contexts.

Nonetheless, no publicly available synthetic dataset exists, posing a barrier
to studying its role for generalization. To address this issue, we first
reproduce and publicly release the synthetic data proposed by Wang et al.
(Mistral-E5). Our synthetic data is high quality and leads to consistent
improvements in performance. Next, we critically examine where exactly
synthetic data improves model generalization. Our analysis reveals that
benefits from synthetic data are sparse and highly localized to individual
datasets. Moreover, we observe trade-offs between the performance on different
categories and data that benefits one task, degrades performance on another.
Our findings highlight the limitations of current synthetic data approaches for
building general-purpose embedders and challenge the notion that training on
synthetic data leads to more robust embedding models across tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to recruitment automation. Large
Language Models (LLMs) were fine-tuned to improve accuracy and efficiency.
Building upon our previous work on the Multilayer Large Language Model-Based
Robotic Process Automation Applicant Tracking (MLAR) system . This work
introduces a novel methodology. Training fine-tuned LLMs specifically tuned for
recruitment tasks. The proposed framework addresses the limitations of generic
LLMs by creating a synthetic dataset that uses a standardized JSON format. This
helps ensure consistency and scalability. In addition to the synthetic data
set, the resumes were parsed using DeepSeek, a high-parameter LLM. The resumes
were parsed into the same structured JSON format and placed in the training
set. This will help improve data diversity and realism. Through
experimentation, we demonstrate significant improvements in performance
metrics, such as exact match, F1 score, BLEU score, ROUGE score, and overall
similarity compared to base models and other state-of-the-art LLMs. In
particular, the fine-tuned Phi-4 model achieved the highest F1 score of 90.62%,
indicating exceptional precision and recall in recruitment tasks. This study
highlights the potential of fine-tuned LLMs. Furthermore, it will revolutionize
recruitment workflows by providing more accurate candidate-job matching.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Mask-GCG是一种针对大型语言模型越狱攻击的改进方法，通过可学习的令牌掩码识别后缀中的关键令牌，修剪冗余令牌来降低计算开销并提高攻击效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GCG越狱攻击方法使用固定长度的后缀，但其中可能存在冗余令牌未被探索。研究旨在通过令牌修剪来提高攻击效率并减少计算成本。

Method: 提出Mask-GCG方法，使用可学习的令牌掩码来识别后缀中高影响力的令牌位置，增加这些位置的更新概率，同时修剪低影响力的冗余令牌。

Result: 实验结果显示，后缀中大多数令牌对攻击成功有重要贡献，修剪少量低影响力令牌不会影响损失值或攻击成功率，揭示了LLM提示中的令牌冗余现象。

Conclusion: Mask-GCG方法有效减少了计算开销并缩短了攻击时间，为从越狱攻击角度开发高效和可解释的LLM提供了见解。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated various
successful methods whereby attackers manipulate models into generating harmful
responses that they are designed to avoid. Among these, Greedy Coordinate
Gradient (GCG) has emerged as a general and effective approach that optimizes
the tokens in a suffix to generate jailbreakable prompts. While several
improved variants of GCG have been proposed, they all rely on fixed-length
suffixes. However, the potential redundancy within these suffixes remains
unexplored. In this work, we propose Mask-GCG, a plug-and-play method that
employs learnable token masking to identify impactful tokens within the suffix.
Our approach increases the update probability for tokens at high-impact
positions while pruning those at low-impact positions. This pruning not only
reduces redundancy but also decreases the size of the gradient space, thereby
lowering computational overhead and shortening the time required to achieve
successful attacks compared to GCG. We evaluate Mask-GCG by applying it to the
original GCG and several improved variants. Experimental results show that most
tokens in the suffix contribute significantly to attack success, and pruning a
minority of low-impact tokens does not affect the loss values or compromise the
attack success rate (ASR), thereby revealing token redundancy in LLM prompts.
Our findings provide insights for developing efficient and interpretable LLMs
from the perspective of jailbreak attacks.

*Ao Chang,Yubo Chen,Jun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出PL-CA方法，通过参数化RAG框架将法律知识编码到参数向量中，并集成到LLM的前馈网络中，缓解模型上下文压力，同时构建了专家标注的多任务法律数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法直接将检索文档注入模型上下文，受限于有限的上下文窗口，引入额外计算开销，破坏模型注意力，降低下游任务性能。现有基准缺乏专家标注且仅关注单一任务，无法反映模型在真实法律场景中的能力。

Method: 提出参数化RAG（P-RAG）框架，对语料知识进行数据增强，将法律知识编码为参数向量，通过LoRA将这些参数知识集成到LLM的前馈网络中。构建了包含2000多个训练和测试实例的多任务法律数据集，全部经过专家标注和人工验证。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在减少过长上下文开销的同时，在下游任务上保持了与传统RAG相当的性能。

Conclusion: PL-CA方法有效解决了传统RAG的上下文限制问题，通过参数化知识集成提高了模型效率，同时构建的高质量多任务数据集为法律领域模型评估提供了更好的基准。

Abstract: Conventional RAG is considered one of the most effective methods for
addressing model knowledge insufficiency and hallucination, particularly in the
judicial domain that requires high levels of knowledge rigor, logical
consistency, and content integrity. However, the conventional RAG method only
injects retrieved documents directly into the model's context, which severely
constrains models due to their limited context windows and introduces
additional computational overhead through excessively long contexts, thereby
disrupting models' attention and degrading performance on downstream tasks.
Moreover, many existing benchmarks lack expert annotation and focus solely on
individual downstream tasks while real-world legal scenarios consist of
multiple mixed legal tasks, indicating conventional benchmarks' inadequacy for
reflecting models' true capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose
PL-CA, which introduces a parametric RAG (P-RAG) framework to perform data
augmentation on corpus knowledge and encode this legal knowledge into
parametric vectors, and then integrates this parametric knowledge into the
LLM's feed-forward networks (FFN) via LoRA, thereby alleviating models' context
pressure. Additionally, we also construct a multi-task legal dataset comprising
more than 2000 training and test instances, which are all expert-annotated and
manually verified. We conduct our experiments on our dataset, and the
experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces the overhead
associated with excessively long contexts while maintaining competitive
performance on downstream tasks compared to conventional RAG. Our code and
dataset are provided in the appendix.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在多语言环境下的常识生成能力，填补现有研究在多语言常识生成评估方面的空白。

Method: 构建MULTICOM基准测试（扩展COCOTEROS数据集至4种语言），评估多个开源LLM，结合自动指标、LLM-as-a-judge方法和人工标注进行综合评估。

Result: 英语表现最优，资源较少语言（如瓦伦西亚语）表现显著较差；上下文支持对资源较少语言有积极影响但效果不一。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在多语言常识生成方面存在明显局限，特别是在资源较少语言上表现不佳，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: This paper explores the multilingual commonsense generation abilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs). To facilitate this investigation, we introduce
MULTICOM, a novel benchmark that extends the COCOTEROS dataset to four
languages: English, Spanish, Dutch, and Valencian. The task involves generating
a commonsensical sentence that includes a given triplet of words. We evaluate a
range of open-source LLMs, including LLaMA, Qwen, Gemma, EuroLLM, and
Salamandra, on this benchmark. Our evaluation combines automatic metrics,
LLM-as-a-judge approaches (using Prometheus and JudgeLM), and human
annotations. Results consistently show superior performance in English, with
significantly lower performance in less-resourced languages. While contextual
support yields mixed results, it tends to benefit underrepresented languages.
These findings underscore the current limitations of LLMs in multilingual
commonsense generation. The dataset is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有开源网页代理在复杂任务上的信息搜索能力有限或缺乏透明实现，主要挑战在于缺乏具有挑战性的信息搜索数据。

Method: 提出WebExplorer系统化数据生成方法，使用基于模型的探索和迭代式长到短查询演化来创建需要多步推理和复杂网页导航的查询-答案对，然后通过监督微调和强化学习训练模型。

Result: WebExplorer-8B在多个信息搜索基准测试中达到同规模最佳性能，在BrowseComp-en/zh上超越WebSailor-72B，在WebWalkerQA和FRAMES上达到100B参数以下模型的最佳表现，同时还在HLE基准上展现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为开发长视野网页代理提供了一条实用路径，证明了通过高质量数据生成和适当训练，较小模型也能在复杂网页任务中表现出色。

Abstract: The paradigm of Large Language Models (LLMs) has increasingly shifted toward
agentic applications, where web browsing capabilities are fundamental for
retrieving information from diverse online sources. However, existing
open-source web agents either demonstrate limited information-seeking abilities
on complex tasks or lack transparent implementations. In this work, we identify
that the key challenge lies in the scarcity of challenging data for information
seeking. To address this limitation, we introduce WebExplorer: a systematic
data generation approach using model-based exploration and iterative,
long-to-short query evolution. This method creates challenging query-answer
pairs that require multi-step reasoning and complex web navigation. By
leveraging our curated high-quality dataset, we successfully develop advanced
web agent WebExplorer-8B through supervised fine-tuning followed by
reinforcement learning. Our model supports 128K context length and up to 100
tool calling turns, enabling long-horizon problem solving. Across diverse
information-seeking benchmarks, WebExplorer-8B achieves the state-of-the-art
performance at its scale. Notably, as an 8B-sized model, WebExplorer-8B is able
to effectively search over an average of 16 turns after RL training, achieving
higher accuracy than WebSailor-72B on BrowseComp-en/zh and attaining the best
performance among models up to 100B parameters on WebWalkerQA and FRAMES.
Beyond these information-seeking tasks, our model also achieves strong
generalization on the HLE benchmark even though it is only trained on
knowledge-intensive QA data. These results highlight our approach as a
practical path toward long-horizon web agents.

TL;DR: 这篇论文探索了Transformer模型的层次缩放策略，提出了三种新的LWS变体（Framed、Reverse、Crown），通过重新分配FFN宽度和注意力头数来提高模型性能，而不增加计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer模型使用均匀的层大小，忽视了不同深度层在功能角色和计算需求上的差异性。需要开发更高效的层次缩放方案来优化模型结构。

Method: 基于Layer-Wise Scaling(LWS)和剪枝技术，提出三种新的LWS变体：Framed、Reverse和Crown。这些方法通过二点或三点线性插值重新分配FFN宽度和注意力头数，在预训练阶段实施。在180M参数和5B标签的固定资源下进行系统性对比实验。

Result: 所有模型都能收敛到相似的损失值，且都比相同成本的均匀基准模型表现更好。训练速度没有显著下降。

Conclusion: 这项工作是预训练阶段层次架构设计的初步探索，未来需要在更大规模的标签和参数上扩展实验以全面评估其潜力。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models traditionally use uniform (isotropic) layer
sizes, yet they ignore the diverse functional roles that different depths can
play and their computational capacity needs. Building on Layer-Wise Scaling
(LWS) and pruning literature, we introduce three new LWS variants - Framed,
Reverse, and Crown - that redistribute FFN widths and attention heads via two
or three-point linear interpolation in the pre-training stage. We present the
first systematic ablation of LWS and its variants, on a fixed budget of 180M
parameters, trained on 5B tokens. All models converge to similar losses and
achieve better performance compared to an equal-cost isotropic baseline,
without a substantial decrease in training throughput. This work represents an
initial step into the design space of layer-wise architectures for
pre-training, but future work should scale experiments to orders of magnitude
more tokens and parameters to fully assess their potential.

TL;DR: LAMDAS是一种利用预训练LLM作为隐式分类器的数据选择方法，通过将数据选择重构为单类分类问题，仅使用少量参考数据就能高效筛选高质量领域数据，在性能和计算效率方面都优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 领域适配LLM面临高质量人工标注数据稀缺的瓶颈，大量未筛选数据直接用于微调会引入噪声降低性能，需要既准确又高效的数据选择方法

Method: 利用预训练LLM本身作为隐式分类器，将数据选择重构为单类分类问题，基于少量参考数据集识别属于目标领域的候选数据，避免显式特征工程和计算密集型优化过程

Result: LAMDAS不仅在使用少量数据的情况下超越了全数据训练的性能，还在各种场景下优于9个最先进的基线方法，在性能提升和计算效率之间达到了最佳平衡

Conclusion: LAMDAS提供了一种高效准确的领域数据选择方法，解决了LLM领域适配中的数据质量瓶颈问题，为实际应用提供了实用的解决方案

Abstract: Adapting large language models (LLMs) to specific domains often faces a
critical bottleneck: the scarcity of high-quality, human-curated data. While
large volumes of unchecked data are readily available, indiscriminately using
them for fine-tuning risks introducing noise and degrading performance.
Strategic data selection is thus crucial, requiring a method that is both
accurate and efficient. Existing approaches, categorized as similarity-based
and direct optimization methods, struggle to simultaneously achieve these
goals. In this paper, we introduce LAMDAS (LLM As an iMplicit classifier for
domain-specific DAta Selection), a novel approach that leverages the
pre-trained LLM itself as an implicit classifier, thereby bypassing explicit
feature engineering and computationally intensive optimization process. LAMDAS
reframes data selection as a one-class classification problem, identifying
candidate data that "belongs" to the target domain defined by a small reference
dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that LAMDAS not only
exceeds the performance of full-data training using a fraction of the data but
also outperforms nine state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines under various
scenarios. Furthermore, LAMDAS achieves the most compelling balance between
performance gains and computational efficiency compared to all evaluated
baselines.

Motivation: 解决知识图谱链接预测中LLM对结构信号利用不足导致的稀疏性和语义模糊问题，特别是在不完整或零样本设置下

Method: 提出模块化框架：1)结构引导邻域增强检索伪邻居丰富稀疏实体；2)动态硬对比学习通过插值正负样本来解决实体级模糊；3)梯度解耦双注入在保持LLM核心参数的同时进行token级结构感知干预

Result: 在WN18RR和FB15k-237数据集上相比基于嵌入和生成的基线方法取得了优越或竞争性的性能

Conclusion: 证明了结构感知表示学习对于可扩展知识图谱补全的有效性，通过轻量级LoRA适配实现了结构信息与语言模型的有机结合

Abstract: Link prediction in knowledge graphs requires integrating structural
information and semantic context to infer missing entities. While large
language models offer strong generative reasoning capabilities, their limited
exploitation of structural signals often results in structural sparsity and
semantic ambiguity, especially under incomplete or zero-shot settings. To
address these challenges, we propose SLiNT (Structure-aware Language model with
Injection and coNtrastive Training), a modular framework that injects
knowledge-graph-derived structural context into a frozen LLM backbone with
lightweight LoRA-based adaptation for robust link prediction. Specifically,
Structure-Guided Neighborhood Enhancement (SGNE) retrieves pseudo-neighbors to
enrich sparse entities and mitigate missing context; Dynamic Hard Contrastive
Learning (DHCL) introduces fine-grained supervision by interpolating hard
positives and negatives to resolve entity-level ambiguity; and
Gradient-Decoupled Dual Injection (GDDI) performs token-level structure-aware
intervention while preserving the core LLM parameters. Experiments on WN18RR
and FB15k-237 show that SLiNT achieves superior or competitive performance
compared with both embedding-based and generation-based baselines,
demonstrating the effectiveness of structure-aware representation learning for
scalable knowledge graph completion.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HAVE是一个无需微调的参数自由解码框架，通过头自适应门控和价值校准来解决LLM在检索增强和长文本生成中的幻觉问题，在多个基准测试中显著减少幻觉并优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在检索增强或长文本生成中即使有相关证据仍会产生幻觉，主要原因是头重要性被视为输入无关的，且原始注意力权重不能准确反映每个token的真实贡献。

Method: HAVE框架包含两个核心模块：头自适应门控（实例级软重加权注意力头）和价值校准（通过价值向量幅度增强注意力来近似写回贡献），通过轻量级不确定性缩放策略将证据与语言模型分布融合。

Result: 在多个QA基准测试和不同LLM家族上的实验表明，HAVE持续减少幻觉，优于包括DAGCD在内的强基线方法，且开销适中。

Conclusion: HAVE框架透明、可复现，可轻松集成到现成的LLM中，无需微调且单次前向传播即可工作，推动了实际场景中可信生成的发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce hallucinations in
retrieval-augmented or long-context generation, even when relevant evidence is
present. This stems from two issues: head importance is treated as
input-agnostic, and raw attention weights poorly reflect each token's true
contribution. We present HAVE (Head-Adaptive Gating and ValuE Calibration), a
parameter-free decoding framework that directly addresses both challenges. HAVE
introduces head-adaptive gating, which performs instance-level soft reweighing
of attention heads, and value calibration, which augments attention with the
magnitude of value vectors to approximate write-back contribution. Together,
these modules construct token-level evidence aligned with model updates and
fuse it with the LM distribution through a lightweight uncertainty-scaled
policy. HAVE requires no finetuning and operates in a single forward pass,
making it efficient and broadly applicable. Experiments across multiple QA
benchmarks and LLM families demonstrate that HAVE consistently reduces
hallucinations and outperforms strong baselines, including DAGCD, with modest
overhead. The framework is transparent, reproducible, and readily integrates
with off-the-shelf LLMs, advancing trustworthy generation in real-world
settings.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into various applications has
driven the need for structured and reliable responses. A key challenge in
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems is ensuring that outputs align
with expected formats while minimizing hallucinations. This study examines the
role of guided decoding in RAG systems, comparing three methods, Outlines,

(0-turn, 1-turn, and 2-turn). By evaluating success rates, hallucination rates,
and output quality, we provide insights into their performance and
applicability. Our findings reveal how multi-turn interactions influence guided
decoding, uncovering unexpected performance variations that can inform method
selection for specific use cases. This work advances the understanding of
structured output generation in RAG systems, offering both theoretical insights

conversations. To address this gap, we introduce IntrEx, the first large
dataset annotated for interestingness and expected interestingness in
teacher-student interactions. Built upon the Teacher-Student Chatroom Corpus
(TSCC), IntrEx extends prior work by incorporating sequence-level annotations,
allowing for the study of engagement beyond isolated turns to capture how
interest evolves over extended dialogues. We employ a rigorous annotation
process with over 100 second-language learners, using a comparison-based rating
approach inspired by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to
improve agreement. We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can
predict human interestingness judgments. We find that LLMs (7B/8B parameters)
fine-tuned on interestingness ratings outperform larger proprietary models like
GPT-4o, demonstrating the potential for specialised datasets to model
engagement in educational settings. Finally, we analyze how linguistic and
cognitive factors, such as concreteness, comprehensibility (readability), and
uptake, influence engagement in educational dialogues.

Abstract: We introduce ParCzech4Speech 1.0, a processed version of the ParCzech 4.0
corpus, targeted at speech modeling tasks with the largest variant containing
2,695 hours. We combined the sound recordings of the Czech parliamentary
speeches with the official transcripts. The recordings were processed with
WhisperX and Wav2Vec 2.0 to extract automated audio-text alignment. Our
processing pipeline improves upon the ParCzech 3.0 speech recognition version
by extracting more data with higher alignment reliability. The dataset is
offered in three flexible variants: (1) sentence-segmented for automatic speech
recognition and speech synthesis tasks with clean boundaries, (2) unsegmented
preserving original utterance flow across sentences, and (3) a raw-alignment
for further custom refinement for other possible tasks. All variants maintain
the original metadata and are released under a permissive CC-BY license. The
dataset is available in the LINDAT repository, with the sentence-segmented and
unsegmented variants additionally available on Hugging Face.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探索了识别论点中人类价值主观性的方法，发现直接识别主观性比通过价值预测推断主观性效果更好，且对比损失与二元交叉熵损失的组合不会提升性能但能减少对标签主观性的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 聚合多个标注为单一真实标签可能会掩盖标注者分歧的宝贵见解，特别是在主观性起关键作用的任务中。本研究旨在识别论点中人类价值的主观性。

Method: 评估了两种主要方法：通过价值预测推断主观性 vs 直接识别主观性。实验还测试了对比损失与二元交叉熵损失的组合效果。

Result: 直接主观性识别显著提高了标记主观论点的模型性能。损失函数组合不会改善性能但减少了每个标签主观性的依赖性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法可以帮助识别个体可能有不同解释的论点，促进更细致的标注过程。

Abstract: Aggregating multiple annotations into a single ground truth label may hide
valuable insights into annotator disagreement, particularly in tasks where
subjectivity plays a crucial role. In this work, we explore methods for
identifying subjectivity in recognizing the human values that motivate
arguments. We evaluate two main approaches: inferring subjectivity through
value prediction vs. directly identifying subjectivity. Our experiments show
that direct subjectivity identification significantly improves the model
performance of flagging subjective arguments. Furthermore, combining
contrastive loss with binary cross-entropy loss does not improve performance
but reduces the dependency on per-label subjectivity. Our proposed methods can
help identify arguments that individuals may interpret differently, fostering a
more nuanced annotation process.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProCon方法通过投影约束损失项来缓解指令微调过程中的拒绝方向漂移问题，有效降低安全风险同时保持任务性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指令微调(IFT)会显著损害大语言模型的安全性，特别是拒绝恶意指令的能力。研究发现隐藏状态中的拒绝方向(r-direction)在训练过程中会发生漂移，这是导致安全风险的原因之一

Method: 提出ProCon方法，引入投影约束损失项来正则化每个训练样本隐藏状态在r-direction上的投影幅度。采用预热策略，早期施加强约束并扩展数据分布来增强约束信号

Result: 在各种数据集、场景和LLM上的实验表明，该方法能显著缓解IFT带来的安全风险，同时保持任务性能增益，相比强基线始终提供更优的整体性能

Conclusion: ProCon有助于在训练过程中稳定r-direction，这种基于可解释性的LLM内部机制探索为未来的安全研究奠定了坚实基础

Abstract: Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) has been widely adopted as an effective
post-training strategy to enhance various abilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, prior studies have shown that IFT can significantly compromise
LLMs' safety, particularly their ability to refuse malicious instructions,
raising significant concerns. Recent research into the internal mechanisms of
LLMs has identified the refusal direction (r-direction) in the hidden states,
which plays a pivotal role in governing refusal behavior. Building on this
insight, our study reveals that the r-direction tends to drift during training,
which we identify as one of the causes of the associated safety risks. To
mitigate such drift, our proposed ProCon method introduces a
projection-constrained loss term that regularizes the projection magnitude of
each training sample's hidden state onto the r-direction. Our initial analysis
shows that applying an appropriate constraint can effectively mitigate the
refusal direction drift and associated safety risks, but remains limited by
overall performance barriers. To overcome this barrier, informed by our
observation of early-stage sharp drift and a data-driven perspective, we
introduce a warm-up strategy that emphasizes early-stage strong constraints and
broaden the data distribution to strengthen constraint signals, leading to an
enhanced ProCon method. Experimental results under various datasets, scenarios,
and LLMs demonstrate that our method can significantly mitigate safety risks
posed by IFT while preserving task performance gains. Even compared with strong
baselines, our method consistently delivers superior overall performance.
Crucially, our analysis indicates that ProCon can contribute to stabilizing the
r-direction during training, while such an interpretability-driven exploration
of LLMs' internal mechanisms lays a solid foundation for future safety
research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MachineLearningLM是一个通过持续预训练框架，使通用大语言模型具备强大的上下文机器学习能力，同时保持通用知识的便携式解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然具有广泛的世界知识和推理能力，但在标准机器学习任务中难以通过纯上下文学习从大量示例中学习，需要梯度下降之外的改进方法。

Method: 使用来自数百万个结构因果模型的合成ML任务进行持续预训练，采用随机森林教师进行知识蒸馏，使用token高效的提示序列化任务，支持最多1,024个样本的上下文学习。

Result: 在Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct模型上，MachineLearningLM在金融、物理、生物和医疗等领域的表格分类任务中平均比强基线模型（如GPT-5-mini）提升约15%，展现出明显的多样本扩展规律，在数百个样本下达到随机森林级别的准确率，同时保持75.4%的MMLU得分。

Conclusion: 该框架成功地为通用LLM赋予了强大的上下文ML能力，实现了无需任务特定训练就能达到传统ML模型性能的目标，同时保持了模型的通用聊天能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess broad world knowledge and strong
general-purpose reasoning ability, yet they struggle to learn from many
in-context examples on standard machine learning (ML) tasks, that is, to
leverage many-shot demonstrations purely via in-context learning (ICL) without
gradient descent. We introduce MachineLearningLM, a portable
continued-pretraining framework that equips a general-purpose LLM with robust
in-context ML capability while preserving its general knowledge and reasoning
for broader chat workflows.
  Our pretraining procedure synthesizes ML tasks from millions of structural
causal models (SCMs), spanning shot counts up to 1,024. We begin with a
random-forest teacher, distilling tree-based decision strategies into the LLM
to strengthen robustness in numerical modeling. All tasks are serialized with a
token-efficient prompt, enabling 3x to 6x more examples per context window and
delivering up to 50x amortized throughput via batch inference.
  Despite a modest setup (Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct with LoRA rank 8),
MachineLearningLM outperforms strong LLM baselines (e.g., GPT-5-mini) by an
average of about 15% on out-of-distribution tabular classification across
finance, physics, biology, and healthcare domains. It exhibits a striking
many-shot scaling law: accuracy increases monotonically as in-context
demonstrations grow from 8 to 1,024. Without any task-specific training, it
attains random-forest-level accuracy across hundreds of shots. General chat
capabilities, including knowledge and reasoning, are preserved: it achieves
75.4% on MMLU.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MoGU_v2框架通过动态路由机制在LLM层间平衡安全性和可用性，解决了传统方法过于保守的问题，实现了双向适应和更好的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全方法往往导致过于保守的拒绝响应，损害了实际可用性。需要在安全性和可用性之间找到更好的平衡点，而不是简单的权衡取舍。

Method: 提出MoGU_v2框架：1）仅在编码高分类性安全特征的层中嵌入路由器；2）路由器优化时激活骨干模块实现双向适应；3）通过动态权重分配平衡安全优化和可用优化变体。

Result: MoGU_v2在各种LLM系列中表现出强大的适应性和稳定改进，包括主流LLM、设备端LLM和推理LLM。即使面对指令微调带来的风险，也能通过简单数据混合策略轻松恢复安全性而不影响任务性能。

Conclusion: MoGU_v2是一个强大且多功能的解决方案，能够有效缓解现实应用中的安全风险，在安全性和可用性之间实现了更好的帕累托前沿。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly permeate human life, their
security has emerged as a critical concern, particularly their ability to
maintain harmless responses to malicious instructions. Although extensive
methods have improved LLMs' security, they often lead to conservative,
rejection-oriented responses that compromise practical usability. This presents
a key challenge: how to advance the Pareto frontier between LLMs' usability and
security, rather than necessitate a trade-off between them. To address this, we
propose the MoGU framework, in which the intra-layer router dynamically
allocates weights by sensing hidden states, thereby balancing the contributions
of security-optimized and usability-optimized variants. Despite its initial
potential, the MoGU framework faces limitations such as parameter redundancy
and performance bottlenecks. To overcome these, we further propose an improved
MoGU_v2 framework that establishes a tighter coupling between the routers and
hidden states. In MoGU_v2, routers are embedded only in layers encoding highly
classifiable security features, and backbone modules are activated during
router optimization to enable bidirectional adaptation. MoGU_V2 exhibits strong
adaptability and stable improvements across various series of LLMs, including
mainstream LLMs serving as brains in various applications, on-device LLMs
optimized for resource-constrained scenarios, and reasoning LLMs tailored for
user interpretability. Meanwhile, even facing risks introduced by Instruction
Fine-tuning, MoGU_v2 can easily restore security without compromising the task
performance gains via a simple data-mix strategy. These comprehensive
improvements highlight MoGU_V2 as a robust and versatile solution for
mitigating security risks in real-world applications.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality, logically sound data is a critical bottleneck
for advancing the mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our
work confronts this challenge by turning decades of automated theorem proving
research into a scalable data engine. Rather than relying on error-prone LLMs
or complex proof-assistant syntax like Lean and Isabelle, our framework
leverages E-prover's saturation capabilities on the vast TPTP axiom library to
derive a massive, guaranteed-valid corpus of theorems. Our pipeline is
principled and simple: saturate axioms, filter for "interesting" theorems, and
generate tasks. With no LLMs in the loop, we eliminate factual errors by
construction. This purely symbolic data is then transformed into three
difficulty-controlled challenges: entailment verification, premise selection,
and proof reconstruction. Our zero-shot experiments on frontier models reveal a
clear weakness: performance collapses on tasks requiring deep, structural
reasoning. Our framework provides both the diagnostic tool to measure this gap
and a scalable source of symbolic training data to address it. We make the code
and data publicly available.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个开源框架，用于基准大语言模型在风电汽车维护日志分类任务上的性能，并建议重点采用人在循环系统来提高数据质量和可靠性分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 风电维护日志的非结构化特性纵级了自动化分析，需要一个可重现的框架来评估LLM在这些复杂工业记录上的表现。

Method: 开发了一个公开源框架，系统性评估多种专利和开源LLM在可靠性、运营效率和模型检验方面的性能。

Result: 结果显示了清晰的性能层次，识别出了与基准标准高度一致且信心度分数可靠的顶级模型。分类性能依赖于任务的语义模糊性，所有模型在对象性组件识别上比解释性维护动作更容易达成共识。

Conclusion: 由于没有模型能达到完美准确性且检验性差异很大，最有效和负责任的应用方式是人在循环系统，让LLM作为强大助手加速和标准化数据标注工作，从而提升O&M数据质量和下游可靠性分析。

Abstract: Effective Operation and Maintenance (O&M) is critical to reducing the
Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE) from wind power, yet the unstructured,
free-text nature of turbine maintenance logs presents a significant barrier to
automated analysis. Our paper addresses this by presenting a novel and
reproducible framework for benchmarking Large Language Models (LLMs) on the
task of classifying these complex industrial records. To promote transparency
and encourage further research, this framework has been made publicly available
as an open-source tool. We systematically evaluate a diverse suite of
state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LLMs, providing a foundational
assessment of their trade-offs in reliability, operational efficiency, and
model calibration. Our results quantify a clear performance hierarchy,
identifying top models that exhibit high alignment with a benchmark standard
and trustworthy, well-calibrated confidence scores. We also demonstrate that
classification performance is highly dependent on the task's semantic
ambiguity, with all models showing higher consensus on objective component
identification than on interpretive maintenance actions. Given that no model
achieves perfect accuracy and that calibration varies dramatically, we conclude
that the most effective and responsible near-term application is a
Human-in-the-Loop system, where LLMs act as a powerful assistant to accelerate
and standardise data labelling for human experts, thereby enhancing O&M data
quality and downstream reliability analysis.

Motivation: 使LLM在内存、延迟和服务成本方面更高效，适用于边缘部署、交互式应用和大规模可持续推理

Method: 联合剪枝罕见词汇（缩小嵌入/解嵌入）和基于常见token加权激活的FFN中间通道剪枝，保持标准transformer架构

Result: 在Qwen、LLaMA和Gemma系列模型（0.5B-70B）上实现同类或更高剪枝率下的SOTA下游任务性能，大幅减少参数、GPU内存和端到端延迟

Conclusion: COMPACT结合了深度和宽度剪枝的优点，具有部署友好性、规模适应性、免训练操作和强内存节省及吞吐量增益

Abstract: Making LLMs more efficient in memory, latency, and serving cost is crucial
for edge deployment, interactive applications, and sustainable inference at
scale. Pruning is a key technique toward this goal. However, prior pruning
methods are limited: width pruning often breaks the standard transformer layout
or requires custom inference code, while depth pruning removes entire layers
and can cause abrupt accuracy drops. In this work, we propose COMPACT, which
jointly (i) prunes rare vocabulary to shrink embedding/unembedding and (ii)
prunes FFN intermediate channels using common-token-weighted activations,
aligning importance with the post-pruning token distribution. COMPACT enjoys
merits of both depth and width pruning, such as: deployment-friendliness (keeps
a standard transformer architecture), scale-adaptivity (trade off vocab vs. FFN
pruning), training-free operation with competitive pruning time, and strong
memory savings alongside throughput gains. Experiments across Qwen, LLaMA, and
Gemma families (0.5B-70B) show state-of-the-art downstream task performance at
similar or higher pruning ratios, with substantial reductions in parameters,
GPU memory, and end-to-end latency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在各种语言任务上表现出色，但确保其可信度仍然是一个关键挑战。特别是在波斯文化背景下，需要文化敏感的评估标准来开发负责任的AI系统。

Method: 创建了一个标注数据集，使用自动化的LLM评估和人工评估相结合的方法，评估了包括ChatGPT、Claude、DeepSeek、Gemini、Grok、LLaMA、Mistral和Qwen在内的多个领先模型。

Conclusion: 该研究为推进可信和具有文化责任感的AI提供了重要见解，指出了关键差距和发展机会，相关数据集已公开提供。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on extensive datasets using advanced
deep learning architectures, have demonstrated remarkable performance across a
wide range of language tasks, becoming a cornerstone of modern AI technologies.
However, ensuring their trustworthiness remains a critical challenge, as
reliability is essential not only for accurate performance but also for
upholding ethical, cultural, and social values. Careful alignment of training
data and culturally grounded evaluation criteria are vital for developing
responsible AI systems. In this study, we introduce the EPT (Evaluation of
Persian Trustworthiness) metric, a culturally informed benchmark specifically
designed to assess the trustworthiness of LLMs across six key aspects:
truthfulness, safety, fairness, robustness, privacy, and ethical alignment. We
curated a labeled dataset and evaluated the performance of several leading
models - including ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, LLaMA, Mistral, and
Qwen - using both automated LLM-based and human assessments. Our results reveal
significant deficiencies in the safety dimension, underscoring the urgent need
for focused attention on this critical aspect of model behavior. Furthermore,
our findings offer valuable insights into the alignment of these models with
Persian ethical-cultural values and highlight critical gaps and opportunities
for advancing trustworthy and culturally responsible AI. The dataset is

TL;DR: 本文提出AggLM方法，通过强化学习训练聚合器模型来整合多个候选解决方案，相比简单投票或奖励模型排名能更有效地提升大语言模型的推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时计算扩展方法主要依赖简单多数投票或奖励模型排名来聚合解决方案，但这些方法可能只能带来有限的性能提升。需要学习更智能的聚合推理能力。

Method: 使用强化学习训练聚合器模型，让模型学习如何审阅、协调和综合多个候选解决方案来生成最终正确答案。关键是通过平衡难易训练样本来学习恢复少数但正确的答案以及容易的多数正确答案。

Result: AggLM方法在多个基准测试中优于基于规则和奖励模型的基线方法，能够有效泛化到不同模型的解决方案，包括比训练数据中更强的模型，同时比使用更多解决方案的多数投票方法需要更少的token。

Conclusion: 将聚合作为显式推理技能进行学习是有效的，通过精心设计的强化学习训练，聚合器模型能够更好地整合多个解决方案，提高大语言模型在推理任务上的性能。

Abstract: Scaling up test-time compute, by generating multiple independent solutions
and selecting or aggregating among them, has become a central paradigm for
improving large language models (LLMs) on challenging reasoning tasks. While
most prior work relies on simple majority voting or reward model ranking to
aggregate solutions, these approaches may only yield limited benefits. In this
work, we propose to learn aggregation as an explicit reasoning skill: given a
set of candidate solutions, we train an aggregator model to review, reconcile,
and synthesize a final, correct answer using reinforcement learning from
verifiable rewards. A key ingredient is careful balancing of easy and hard
training examples, allowing the model to learn both to recover
minority-but-correct answers as well as easy majority-correct answers.
Empirically, we find our method, AggLM, outperforms both strong rule-based and
reward-model baselines, across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, it generalizes
effectively to solutions from differing models, including stronger ones than
contained in the training data, all while requiring substantially fewer tokens
than majority voting with larger numbers of solutions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proof-Carrying Numbers (PCN) 是一种展示层协议，通过机械验证来确保大语言模型生成数字的保真度，将验证放在渲染器而非模型中，防止数字幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型作为随机系统可能生成与可用数据不符的数字，即数字幻觉问题。现有保障措施（检索增强生成、引用、不确定性估计）虽提高透明度但无法保证保真度，仍可能显示伪造或错误引用的数值。

Method: PCN协议将数字跨度作为与结构化声明绑定的声明绑定令牌发出，验证器根据声明的策略（如精确相等、舍入、别名或带限定符的容差）检查每个令牌。验证放在渲染器而非模型中，只有经过声明检查的数字才标记为已验证。

Result: PCN被形式化并证明了声音性、诚实令牌下的完备性、故障关闭行为和策略精炼下的单调性。PCN轻量级且模型无关，可无缝集成到现有应用中，并可扩展加密承诺。

Conclusion: 通过在显示前强制进行验证，PCN为数字敏感环境建立了简单契约：信任只能通过证明获得，而缺乏标记则传达不确定性，有效防止欺骗并保证故障关闭行为。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as stochastic systems may generate numbers that
deviate from available data, a failure known as \emph{numeric hallucination}.
Existing safeguards -- retrieval-augmented generation, citations, and
uncertainty estimation -- improve transparency but cannot guarantee fidelity:
fabricated or misquoted values may still be displayed as if correct. We propose
\textbf{Proof-Carrying Numbers (PCN)}, a presentation-layer protocol that
enforces numeric fidelity through mechanical verification. Under PCN, numeric
spans are emitted as \emph{claim-bound tokens} tied to structured claims, and a
verifier checks each token under a declared policy (e.g., exact equality,
rounding, aliases, or tolerance with qualifiers). Crucially, PCN places
verification in the \emph{renderer}, not the model: only claim-checked numbers
are marked as verified, and all others default to unverified. This separation
prevents spoofing and guarantees fail-closed behavior. We formalize PCN and
prove soundness, completeness under honest tokens, fail-closed behavior, and
monotonicity under policy refinement. PCN is lightweight and model-agnostic,
integrates seamlessly into existing applications, and can be extended with
cryptographic commitments. By enforcing verification as a mandatory step before
display, PCN establishes a simple contract for numerically sensitive settings:
\emph{trust is earned only by proof}, while the absence of a mark communicates
uncertainty.

TL;DR: 提出了一种双层优化方法，通过让监督微调(SFT)元学习如何指导强化学习(RL)的优化过程，实现SFT和RL的更好协作，在五个推理基准测试中表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的两阶段方法（先SFT后RL）限制了两种训练范式的交互，影响了整体效果。RL虽然能激励大语言模型的推理能力，但其试错性质导致效率低下。

Method: 采用双层优化框架：下层执行RL更新并同时接收SFT监督，上层显式最大化协作增益（联合训练相比单独RL的性能优势）。通过将SFT目标条件化在最优RL策略上，使SFT能够元学习指导RL优化过程。

Result: 在五个推理基准测试中，该方法 consistently outperforms baselines，并在效果和效率之间达到了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: 所提出的双层优化方法能够有效促进SFT和RL训练范式之间的协作，显著提升推理模型的性能和训练效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective in incentivizing the
reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), but suffers from severe
efficiency challenges due to its trial-and-error nature. While the common
practice employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a warm-up stage for RL, this
decoupled two-stage approach limits interaction between SFT and RL, thereby
constraining overall effectiveness. This study introduces a novel method for
learning reasoning models that employs bilevel optimization to facilitate
better cooperation between these training paradigms. By conditioning the SFT
objective on the optimal RL policy, our approach enables SFT to meta-learn how
to guide RL's optimization process. During training, the lower level performs
RL updates while simultaneously receiving SFT supervision, and the upper level
explicitly maximizes the cooperative gain-the performance advantage of joint
SFT-RL training over RL alone. Empirical evaluations on five reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines and
achieves a better balance between effectiveness and efficiency.

Motivation: 现有的扩散语言模型在复杂推理任务上表现不佳，需要一种能够整合偏好推理轨迹的后训练方法来提升性能。

Method: 提出TraceRL框架，使用基于扩散的价值模型增强训练稳定性，支持跨架构应用，并能将块特定模型适配到更大块中。

Result: 开发的TraDo模型系列在数学推理任务上表现优异：TraDo-4B-Instruct超越7B规模的自回归模型，TraDo-8B-Instruct在数学基准上相对Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct提升6.1%，相对Llama3.1-8B-Instruct提升51.3%。通过课程学习开发的首个长链思维扩散语言模型在MATH500上相对Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct提升18.1%。

Conclusion: TraceRL框架有效提升了扩散语言模型的推理能力，提供了开源框架支持多样化架构的构建、训练和部署，推动了扩散LLM的可复现研究和实际应用。

Abstract: We propose TraceRL, a trajectory-aware reinforcement learning framework for
diffusion language models (DLMs) that incorporates preferred inference
trajectory into post-training, and is applicable across different
architectures. Equipped with a diffusion-based value model that enhances
training stability, we demonstrate improved reasoning performance on complex
math and coding tasks. Besides, it can also be applied to adapt block-specific
models to larger blocks, which improves sampling flexibility. Employing
TraceRL, we derive a series of state-of-the-art diffusion language models,
namely TraDo. Although smaller than 7B-scale AR models, TraDo-4B-Instruct still
consistently outperforms them across complex math reasoning tasks.
TraDo-8B-Instruct achieves relative accuracy improvements of 6.1% over
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and 51.3% over Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on mathematical
reasoning benchmarks. Through curriculum learning, we also derive the first
long-CoT DLM, outperforming Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on MATH500 with an 18.1%
relative accuracy gain. To facilitate reproducible research and practical
applications, we release a comprehensive open-source framework for building,
training, and deploying diffusion LLMs across diverse architectures. The
framework integrates accelerated KV-cache techniques and inference engines for
both inference and reinforcement learning, and includes implementations of
various supervised fine-tuning and RL methods for mathematics, coding, and
general tasks. Code and Models: https://github.com/Gen-Verse/dLLM-RL

### [231] [On the Same Wavelength? Evaluating Pragmatic Reasoning in Language Models across Broad Concepts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06952)
*Linlu Qiu,Cedegao E. Zhang,Joshua B. Tenenbaum,Yoon Kim,Roger P. Levy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过Wavelength游戏框架评估语言模型的语用理解能力，发现大型模型在语言理解上接近人类水平，而在语言生成中采用RSA理论可显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型作为会话助所的广泛使用，需要理解其语用理解能力，即如何在上下文中进行交际理解和规范推理。

Method: 使用Wavelength通信游戏框架，研究了直接提示、思维链提示(CoT)以及理性语言行为(RSA)方法，评估语言模型在语言理解和生成两个方面的表现。

Result: 现有最先进的大型语言模型在语言理解任务上达到了类似于人类的准确性，与人类判断呈现高相关性。在语言生成任务中，CoT提示比直接提示效果更好，而RSA方法在两种提示方式上都带来了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该研究帮助识别了语言模型在语用理解方面的优势与限制，并证明了RSA方法在改善模型理解能力方面的潜力，为了解概念表征、语言理解和社会理解提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Language use is shaped by pragmatics -- i.e., reasoning about communicative
goals and norms in context. As language models (LMs) are increasingly used as
conversational agents, it becomes ever more important to understand their
pragmatic reasoning abilities. We propose an evaluation framework derived from
Wavelength, a popular communication game where a speaker and a listener
communicate about a broad range of concepts in a granular manner. We study a
range of LMs on both language comprehension and language production using
direct and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, and further explore a Rational
Speech Act (RSA) approach to incorporating Bayesian pragmatic reasoning into LM
inference. We find that state-of-the-art LMs, but not smaller ones, achieve
strong performance on language comprehension, obtaining similar-to-human
accuracy and exhibiting high correlations with human judgments even without CoT
prompting or RSA. On language production, CoT can outperform direct prompting,
and using RSA provides significant improvements over both approaches. Our study
helps identify the strengths and limitations in LMs' pragmatic reasoning
abilities and demonstrates the potential for improving them with RSA, opening
up future avenues for understanding conceptual representation, language
understanding, and social reasoning in LMs and humans.

Abstract: We present Multi-EuP, a new multilingual benchmark dataset, comprising 22K
multi-lingual documents collected from the European Parliament, spanning 24
languages. This dataset is designed to investigate fairness in a multilingual
information retrieval (IR) context to analyze both language and demographic
bias in a ranking context. It boasts an authentic multilingual corpus,
featuring topics translated into all 24 languages, as well as cross-lingual
relevance judgments. Furthermore, it offers rich demographic information
associated with its documents, facilitating the study of demographic bias. We
report the effectiveness of Multi-EuP for benchmarking both monolingual and
multilingual IR. We also conduct a preliminary experiment on language bias
caused by the choice of tokenization strategy.

Motivation: 增强现实系统在战术环境中应用日益普及，但容易受到认知攻击的威胁，这些攻击会撩动用户知觉并严重影响决策能力。

Method: 设计了知觉图模型，首先模仿人类从混合现实环境中解释关键信息的过程，然后使用语义意义结构表示解释结果。

Result: 模型能够计算出反映知觉扬曲程度的定量分数，为检测和分析认知攻击的影响提供了稳健可测量的方法。

Conclusion: 知觉图模型为增强现实系统提供了一种有效的方法来评估和应对认知攻击对用户知觉的影响，提高系统的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Augmented reality (AR) systems are increasingly deployed in tactical
environments, but their reliance on seamless human-computer interaction makes
them vulnerable to cognitive attacks that manipulate a user's perception and
severely compromise user decision-making. To address this challenge, we
introduce the Perception Graph, a novel model designed to reason about human
perception within these systems. Our model operates by first mimicking the
human process of interpreting key information from an MR environment and then
representing the outcomes using a semantically meaningful structure. We
demonstrate how the model can compute a quantitative score that reflects the
level of perception distortion, providing a robust and measurable method for
detecting and analyzing the effects of such cognitive attacks.

Conclusion: SynDelay通过Supply Chain Data Hub公开提供，鼓励社区贡献数据集、模型和评估实践，推动供应链AI领域的研究发展，所有代码均已开源。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming supply chain management, yet
progress in predictive tasks -- such as delivery delay prediction -- remains
constrained by the scarcity of high-quality, openly available datasets.
Existing datasets are often proprietary, small, or inconsistently maintained,
hindering reproducibility and benchmarking. We present SynDelay, a synthetic
dataset designed for delivery delay prediction. Generated using an advanced
generative model trained on real-world data, SynDelay preserves realistic
delivery patterns while ensuring privacy. Although not entirely free of noise
or inconsistencies, it provides a challenging and practical testbed for
advancing predictive modelling. To support adoption, we provide baseline
results and evaluation metrics as initial benchmarks, serving as reference
points rather than state-of-the-art claims. SynDelay is publicly available
through the Supply Chain Data Hub, an open initiative promoting dataset sharing
and benchmarking in supply chain AI. We encourage the community to contribute
datasets, models, and evaluation practices to advance research in this area.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前情感识别领域缺乏包含身体运动和生理信号的多模态数据集，限制了该领域的发展。

Method: 收集13名参与者在VR情感刺激下的同步多模态数据（眼动、身体运动、EMG、GSR），采用早期和晚期融合技术进行特征融合，并使用分类器评估情感可分离性。

Result: MVRS数据集验证了多模态情感数据的质量，证明了不同情感状态的可分离性。

Conclusion: MVRS数据集为多模态情感计算提供了有价值的资源，推动了包含生理和运动信号的情感识别研究。

Abstract: Automatic emotion recognition has become increasingly important with the rise
of AI, especially in fields like healthcare, education, and automotive systems.
However, there is a lack of multimodal datasets, particularly involving body
motion and physiological signals, which limits progress in the field. To
address this, the MVRS dataset is introduced, featuring synchronized recordings
from 13 participants aged 12 to 60 exposed to VR based emotional stimuli
(relaxation, fear, stress, sadness, joy). Data were collected using eye
tracking (via webcam in a VR headset), body motion (Kinect v2), and EMG and GSR
signals (Arduino UNO), all timestamp aligned. Participants followed a unified
protocol with consent and questionnaires. Features from each modality were
extracted, fused using early and late fusion techniques, and evaluated with
classifiers to confirm the datasets quality and emotion separability, making
MVRS a valuable contribution to multimodal affective computing.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究对GPT-4o、DeepSeek-V3和GLM-4.5三种先进大语言模型在个性化学习辅导任务中的表现进行了实证比较，发现GPT-4o在提供信息丰富、结构良好的反馈方面表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型越来越多地被设想为个性化学习的智能助手，但在真实学习场景中的系统性对比评估仍然有限，需要在实际学习环境中对这些模型的性能进行实证比较。

Method: 使用包含学生答案和正确性标签的数据集，要求每个LLM分析测验、推断学生掌握情况并生成针对性指导。采用Gemini作为虚拟裁判进行多维度成对比较（准确性、清晰度、可操作性、适当性），并通过Bradley-Terry模型分析结果。

Result: GPT-4o总体上更受青睐，产生的反馈比其他模型更信息丰富且结构更好；DeepSeek-V3和GLM-4.5表现出间歇性优势但一致性较低。

Conclusion: 研究结果突显了将LLMs部署为高级教学助手进行个性化支持的可行性，并为未来LLM驱动的个性化学习实证研究提供了方法学指导。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly envisioned as intelligent
assistants for personalized learning, systematic head-to-head evaluations
within authentic learning scenarios remain limited. This study conducts an
empirical comparison of three state-of-the-art LLMs on a tutoring task that
simulates a realistic learning setting. Using a dataset comprising a student's
answers to ten questions of mixed formats with correctness labels, each LLM is
required to (i) analyze the quiz to identify underlying knowledge components,
(ii) infer the student's mastery profile, and (iii) generate targeted guidance
for improvement. To mitigate subjectivity and evaluator bias, we employ Gemini
as a virtual judge to perform pairwise comparisons along various dimensions:
accuracy, clarity, actionability, and appropriateness. Results analyzed via the
Bradley-Terry model indicate that GPT-4o is generally preferred, producing
feedback that is more informative and better structured than its counterparts,
while DeepSeek-V3 and GLM-4.5 demonstrate intermittent strengths but lower
consistency. These findings highlight the feasibility of deploying LLMs as
advanced teaching assistants for individualized support and provide
methodological guidance for future empirical research on LLM-driven
personalized learning.

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了LLM驱动的AI系统在简化科学工作流程和增强小角散射研究自动化方面的巨大潜力

Abstract: We introduce SasAgent, a multi-agent AI system powered by large language
models (LLMs) that automates small-angle scattering (SAS) data analysis by
leveraging tools from the SasView software and enables user interaction via
text input. SasAgent features a coordinator agent that interprets user prompts
and delegates tasks to three specialized agents for scattering length density
(SLD) calculation, synthetic data generation, and experimental data fitting.
These agents utilize LLM-friendly tools to execute tasks efficiently. These
tools, including the model data tool, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
documentation tool, bump fitting tool, and SLD calculator tool, are derived
from the SasView Python library. A user-friendly Gradio-based interface
enhances user accessibility. Through diverse examples, we demonstrate
SasAgent's ability to interpret complex prompts, calculate SLDs, generate
accurate scattering data, and fit experimental datasets with high precision.
This work showcases the potential of LLM-driven AI systems to streamline
scientific workflows and enhance automation in SAS research.

*Arend Hintze*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文通过自相关分析揭示了提示工程中两种不同生成策略（系统枚举和多样化生成）产生的截然不同的优化景观拓扑结构，为理解提示优化的复杂性提供了实证基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前提示工程方法将优化视为黑盒问题，缺乏对优化景观拓扑结构的理解，需要系统分析提示工程中的适应度景观结构。

Method: 使用自相关分析在语义嵌入空间中分析两种提示生成策略：系统枚举（1,024个提示）和多样化生成（1,000个提示），并在10个错误检测类别上进行任务特定分析。

Result: 系统提示生成产生平滑衰减的自相关，而多样化生成显示非单调模式，在中间语义距离处达到峰值相关性，表明存在崎岖、分层结构的景观。不同错误类型显示出不同程度的崎岖性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了提示工程优化景观的复杂拓扑结构，为开发更有效的提示优化算法提供了重要见解和实证基础。

Abstract: While prompt engineering has emerged as a crucial technique for optimizing
large language model performance, the underlying optimization landscape remains
poorly understood. Current approaches treat prompt optimization as a black-box
problem, applying sophisticated search algorithms without characterizing the
landscape topology they navigate. We present a systematic analysis of fitness
landscape structures in prompt engineering using autocorrelation analysis
across semantic embedding spaces. Through experiments on error detection tasks
with two distinct prompt generation strategies -- systematic enumeration (1,024
prompts) and novelty-driven diversification (1,000 prompts) -- we reveal
fundamentally different landscape topologies. Systematic prompt generation
yields smoothly decaying autocorrelation, while diversified generation exhibits
non-monotonic patterns with peak correlation at intermediate semantic
distances, indicating rugged, hierarchically structured landscapes.
Task-specific analysis across 10 error detection categories reveals varying
degrees of ruggedness across different error types. Our findings provide an
empirical foundation for understanding the complexity of optimization in prompt
engineering landscapes.

Conclusion: 该框架是医疗编码领域的重要进展，为未来工作提供了性能分析和盲点识别的基础

Abstract: In medical coding, experts map unstructured clinical notes to alphanumeric
codes for diagnoses and procedures. We introduce Code Like Humans: a new
agentic framework for medical coding with large language models. It implements
official coding guidelines for human experts, and it is the first solution that
can support the full ICD-10 coding system (+70K labels). It achieves the best
performance to date on rare diagnosis codes (fine-tuned discriminative
classifiers retain an advantage for high-frequency codes, to which they are
limited). Towards future work, we also contribute an analysis of system
performance and identify its `blind spots' (codes that are systematically
undercoded).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了Alignment Gap概念，统一解释RLHF等对齐方法的失败模式，通过KL-tilting形式化说明优化压力如何放大代理奖励与人类意图的差异，并提出了Alignment Trilemma和MAPS框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人类偏好对齐方法（如RLHF、DPO等）虽然有效，但存在奖励破解、奉承、标注者漂移和错误泛化等重复性失败模式，需要统一的理论框架来理解和解决这些问题。

Method: 使用KL-tilting形式化方法分析优化压力导致的偏差，组织失败模式为AI对齐的Murphy定律目录，提出Alignment Trilemma理论框架，并通过小规模实证研究进行验证。

Result: 建立了Alignment Gap概念作为统一分析框架，识别了优化强度、价值捕获和泛化之间的三难权衡，提出了MAPS（错误设定、标注、压力、偏移）实用设计杠杆。

Conclusion: 本文不是提出不可能定理，而是提供了一个重构对齐辩论的视角，围绕结构限制和权衡，为未来设计提供更清晰的指导。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly aligned to human preferences through
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and related methods such as
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Constitutional AI, and RLAIF. While
effective, these methods exhibit recurring failure patterns i.e., reward
hacking, sycophancy, annotator drift, and misgeneralization. We introduce the
concept of the Alignment Gap, a unifying lens for understanding recurring
failures in feedback-based alignment. Using a KL-tilting formalism, we
illustrate why optimization pressure tends to amplify divergence between proxy
rewards and true human intent. We organize these failures into a catalogue of
Murphys Laws of AI Alignment, and propose the Alignment Trilemma as a way to
frame trade-offs among optimization strength, value capture, and
generalization. Small-scale empirical studies serve as illustrative support.
Finally, we propose the MAPS framework (Misspecification, Annotation, Pressure,
Shift) as practical design levers. Our contribution is not a definitive
impossibility theorem but a perspective that reframes alignment debates around
structural limits and trade-offs, offering clearer guidance for future design.

TL;DR: 一种多段系统能够在真实街道图像上编辑和重新设计自行车设施，通过车道定位、提示优化、设计生成和自动评估等步骤生成详实的街道设计场景，支持主动交通规划中的公众参与和协作决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统街道设计渲染方法劳动密集，影响公众参与和集体决策。AI辅助生成式设计虽有潜力，但现有方法需要大量领域特定数据，且在复杂街道场景中难以实现精确的空间变化设计。

Method: 开发了一种多段系统，集成了车道定位、提示优化、设计生成和自动评估等功能，直接在真实世界街道图像上编辑和重新设计自行车设施。

Result: 在多样化城市场景中进行实验，系统能够适应不同的路网几何形状和环境条件，一质地产生视觉一致、符合指令要求的结果。

Conclusion: 这项工作为应用多段管道到交通基础设施规划和设施设计领域奠定了基础。

Abstract: Realistic visual renderings of street-design scenarios are essential for
public engagement in active transportation planning. Traditional approaches are
labor-intensive, hindering collective deliberation and collaborative
decision-making. While AI-assisted generative design shows transformative
potential by enabling rapid creation of design scenarios, existing generative
approaches typically require large amounts of domain-specific training data and
struggle to enable precise spatial variations of design/configuration in
complex street-view scenes. We introduce a multi-agent system that edits and
redesigns bicycle facilities directly on real-world street-view imagery. The
framework integrates lane localization, prompt optimization, design generation,
and automated evaluation to synthesize realistic, contextually appropriate
designs. Experiments across diverse urban scenarios demonstrate that the system
can adapt to varying road geometries and environmental conditions, consistently
yielding visually coherent and instruction-compliant results. This work
establishes a foundation for applying multi-agent pipelines to transportation
infrastructure planning and facility design.

### [243] [TreeGPT: A Novel Hybrid Architecture for Abstract Syntax Tree Processing with Global Parent-Child Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05550)
*Zixi Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TreeGPT是一种结合Transformer注意力机制和全局父子聚合的新型神经架构，专门用于处理抽象语法树(AST)的程序合成任务，在ARC Prize 2025数据集上达到96%准确率，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法要么依赖序列处理，要么使用图神经网络，无法有效捕捉AST的层次结构和全局依赖关系。需要一种能够同时处理局部依赖和层次树结构的混合架构。

Method: 采用混合设计：使用自注意力机制捕捉局部依赖，通过专门的Tree Feed-Forward Network和全局父子聚合机制建模层次树结构。核心创新是全局父子聚合公式，通过迭代消息传递让每个节点逐步聚合整棵树的信息。

Result: 在ARC Prize 2025数据集上达到96%准确率，显著优于Transformer基线(1.3%)、Grok-4(15.9%)和SOAR(52%)等方法，仅使用150万参数。消融研究表明边缘投影是最关键组件。

Conclusion: TreeGPT成功证明了结合注意力机制和树结构聚合的有效性，为神经程序合成任务提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，在保持参数效率的同时实现了卓越性能。

Abstract: We introduce TreeGPT, a novel neural architecture that combines
transformer-based attention mechanisms with global parent-child aggregation for
processing Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) in neural program synthesis tasks.
Unlike traditional approaches that rely solely on sequential processing or
graph neural networks, TreeGPT employs a hybrid design that leverages both
self-attention for capturing local dependencies and a specialized Tree
Feed-Forward Network (TreeFFN) for modeling hierarchical tree structures
through iterative message passing.
  The core innovation lies in our Global Parent-Child Aggregation mechanism,
formalized as: $$h_i^{(t+1)} = \sigma \Big( h_i^{(0)} + W_{pc} \sum_{(p,c) \in
E_i} f(h_p^{(t)}, h_c^{(t)}) + b \Big)$$ where $h_i^{(t)}$ represents the
hidden state of node $i$ at iteration $t$, $E_i$ denotes all parent-child edges
involving node $i$, and $f(h_p, h_c)$ is an edge aggregation function. This
formulation enables each node to progressively aggregate information from the
entire tree structure through $T$ iterations.
  Our architecture integrates optional enhancements including gated aggregation
with learnable edge weights, residual connections for gradient stability, and
bidirectional propagation for capturing both bottom-up and top-down
dependencies. We evaluate TreeGPT on the ARC Prize 2025 dataset, a challenging
visual reasoning benchmark requiring abstract pattern recognition and rule
inference. Experimental results demonstrate that TreeGPT achieves 96\%
accuracy, significantly outperforming transformer baselines (1.3\%),
large-scale models like Grok-4 (15.9\%), and specialized program synthesis
methods like SOAR (52\%) while using only 1.5M parameters. Our comprehensive
ablation study reveals that edge projection is the most critical component,
with the combination of edge projection and gating achieving optimal
performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OccVLA是一个将3D占用表示集成到多模态推理过程中的新框架，通过将密集3D占用作为预测输出和监督信号，直接从2D视觉输入学习细粒度空间结构，在自动驾驶任务中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言推理方面表现出色，但缺乏稳健的3D空间理解能力，这对于自动驾驶至关重要。主要挑战包括：构建有效3D表示的难度和细粒度空间细节的丢失。

Method: 提出OccVLA框架，将3D占用表示作为预测输出和监督信号，直接从2D视觉输入学习空间结构。占用预测被视为隐式推理过程，在推理时可跳过而不增加计算开销。

Result: 在nuScenes基准测试中实现了轨迹规划的最先进结果，在3D视觉问答任务上表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: OccVLA提供了一个可扩展、可解释且完全基于视觉的自动驾驶解决方案，无需昂贵的手动标注或大规模3D视觉语言预训练。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong vision-language
reasoning abilities but still lack robust 3D spatial understanding, which is
critical for autonomous driving. This limitation stems from two key challenges:
(1) the difficulty of constructing accessible yet effective 3D representations
without expensive manual annotations, and (2) the loss of fine-grained spatial
details in VLMs due to the absence of large-scale 3D vision-language
pretraining. To address these challenges, we propose OccVLA, a novel framework
that integrates 3D occupancy representations into a unified multimodal
reasoning process. Unlike prior approaches that rely on explicit 3D inputs,
OccVLA treats dense 3D occupancy as both a predictive output and a supervisory
signal, enabling the model to learn fine-grained spatial structures directly
from 2D visual inputs. The occupancy predictions are regarded as implicit
reasoning processes and can be skipped during inference without performance
degradation, thereby adding no extra computational overhead. OccVLA achieves
state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes benchmark for trajectory planning and
demonstrates superior performance on 3D visual question-answering tasks,
offering a scalable, interpretable, and fully vision-based solution for
autonomous driving.

Result: 在两个真实数据集上的验证显示，MSRFormer在道路网络分析任务中优于基线方法，在复杂道路网络结构中相比最具竞争力的基线方法提升达16%。

Conclusion: 该研究为开发任务无关的道路网络表示模型提供了实用框架，揭示了尺度效应与空间交互流量异质性之间的独特关联模式。

Abstract: Transforming road network data into vector representations using deep
learning has proven effective for road network analysis. However, urban road
networks' heterogeneous and hierarchical nature poses challenges for accurate
representation learning. Graph neural networks, which aggregate features from
neighboring nodes, often struggle due to their homogeneity assumption and focus
on a single structural scale. To address these issues, this paper presents
MSRFormer, a novel road network representation learning framework that
integrates multi-scale spatial interactions by addressing their flow
heterogeneity and long-distance dependencies. It uses spatial flow convolution
to extract small-scale features from large trajectory datasets, and identifies
scale-dependent spatial interaction regions to capture the spatial structure of
road networks and flow heterogeneity. By employing a graph transformer,
MSRFormer effectively captures complex spatial dependencies across multiple
scales. The spatial interaction features are fused using residual connections,
which are fed to a contrastive learning algorithm to derive the final road
network representation. Validation on two real-world datasets demonstrates that
MSRFormer outperforms baseline methods in two road network analysis tasks. The
performance gains of MSRFormer suggest the traffic-related task benefits more
from incorporating trajectory data, also resulting in greater improvements in
complex road network structures with up to 16% improvements compared to the
most competitive baseline method. This research provides a practical framework
for developing task-agnostic road network representation models and highlights
distinct association patterns of the interplay between scale effects and flow
heterogeneity of spatial interactions.

Method: 提出CogEdit基准评估三个元认知层次，并开发MIND框架：构建元知识记忆实现自我意识，使用博弈论交互监控知识激活，通过标签精炼实现噪声鲁棒更新。

Abstract: Knowledge editing enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to
efficiently update outdated or incorrect information. However, existing
benchmarks primarily emphasize cognitive-level modifications while lacking a
focus on deeper meta-cognitive processes. To bridge this gap, we introduce
CogEdit, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' meta-cognitive knowledge
editing abilities across three levels: (1) Counterfactual-Driven Editing,
assessing self-awareness of knowledge correctness changes; (2) Boundary
Constraint Editing, ensuring appropriate generalization without unintended
interference; and (3) Noise-Robust Editing, promoting reflective evaluation of
uncertain information. To advance meta-cognitive editing, we propose MIND
(Meta-cognitive INtegrated Dynamic Knowledge Editing), a framework that
constructs a meta-knowledge memory for self-awareness, employs game-theoretic
interactions to monitor knowledge activation, and incorporates label refinement
for noise-robust updates. Extensive experiments show that MIND significantly
outperforms existing cognitive editing approaches, achieving strong performance
on both traditional and meta-cognitive knowledge editing benchmarks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and
demonstrated superior performance across various tasks, including natural
language processing (NLP), weather forecasting, biological protein folding,
text generation, and solving mathematical problems. However, many real-world
data exhibit highly non-Euclidean latent hierarchical anatomy, such as protein
networks, transportation networks, financial networks, brain networks, and
linguistic structures or syntactic trees in natural languages. Effectively
learning intrinsic semantic entailment and hierarchical relationships from
these raw, unstructured input data using LLMs remains an underexplored area.
Due to its effectiveness in modeling tree-like hierarchical structures,
hyperbolic geometry -- a non-Euclidean space -- has rapidly gained popularity
as an expressive latent representation space for complex data modeling across
domains such as graphs, images, languages, and multi-modal data. Here, we
provide a comprehensive and contextual exposition of recent advancements in
LLMs that leverage hyperbolic geometry as a representation space to enhance
semantic representation learning and multi-scale reasoning. Specifically, the
paper presents a taxonomy of the principal techniques of Hyperbolic LLMs
(HypLLMs) in terms of four main categories: (1) hyperbolic LLMs through exp/log
maps; (2) hyperbolic fine-tuned models; (3) fully hyperbolic LLMs, and (4)
hyperbolic state-space models. We also explore crucial potential applications
and outline future research directions. A repository of key papers, models,
datasets, and code implementations is available at

Motivation: 能源管理中不确定性决策因未知参数而复杂化，传统预测后优化方法存在预测误差传导问题，决策导向学习方法虽能整合预测与优化但缺乏实际验证，且现实BESS应用面临数据稀缺和变异性挑战。

Method: 提出AFE-DFL框架，利用自动特征工程提取丰富特征表示，结合决策导向学习方法同时进行电价需求预测和BESS运营优化，在真实英国房产数据集上进行验证。

Result: DFL方法比PTO平均产生更低运营成本，添加AFE后DFL性能相比无AFE模型提升22.9-56.5%，证明了DFL在实际场景中的可行性。

Conclusion: 领域特定的自动特征工程增强了决策导向学习，减少了对BESS优化领域专业知识的依赖，为面临类似挑战的能源管理系统带来经济效益和更广泛影响。

Abstract: Decision-making under uncertainty in energy management is complicated by
unknown parameters hindering optimal strategies, particularly in Battery Energy
Storage System (BESS) operations. Predict-Then-Optimise (PTO) approaches treat
forecasting and optimisation as separate processes, allowing prediction errors
to cascade into suboptimal decisions as models minimise forecasting errors
rather than optimising downstream tasks. The emerging Decision-Focused Learning
(DFL) methods overcome this limitation by integrating prediction and
optimisation; however, they are relatively new and have been tested primarily
on synthetic datasets or small-scale problems, with limited evidence of their
practical viability. Real-world BESS applications present additional
challenges, including greater variability and data scarcity due to collection
constraints and operational limitations. Because of these challenges, this work
leverages Automated Feature Engineering (AFE) to extract richer representations
and improve the nascent approach of DFL. We propose an AFE-DFL framework
suitable for small datasets that forecasts electricity prices and demand while
optimising BESS operations to minimise costs. We validate its effectiveness on
a novel real-world UK property dataset. The evaluation compares DFL methods
against PTO, with and without AFE. The results show that, on average, DFL
yields lower operating costs than PTO and adding AFE further improves the
performance of DFL methods by 22.9-56.5% compared to the same models without
AFE. These findings provide empirical evidence for DFL's practical viability in
real-world settings, indicating that domain-specific AFE enhances DFL and
reduces reliance on domain expertise for BESS optimisation, yielding economic
benefits with broader implications for energy management systems facing similar
challenges.

Motivation: 患者需要具备相关知识才能积极参与自身护理，但传统方法缺乏有效的患者教育工具

Method: 基于轻量级LLaMA 3.2 3B模型，采用两阶段训练：先在合成医疗对话数据上进行监督微调，然后通过强化学习（PPO）在模拟出院场景中进行奖励优化

Result: 模型展现出关键的患者教育行为特征，在Turing测试中超越非专家人类表现，证明低成本PPO强化学习在开放对话领域的可行性

Conclusion: 该方法展示了将低成本RL对齐方法应用于现实开放对话领域的潜力和可行性，为医疗教育和其他对话领域提供了有前景的解决方案

Abstract: Patients must possess the knowledge necessary to actively participate in
their care. We present NoteAid-Chatbot, a conversational AI that promotes
patient understanding via a novel 'learning as conversation' framework, built
on a multi-agent large language model (LLM) and reinforcement learning (RL)
setup without human-labeled data. NoteAid-Chatbot was built on a lightweight
LLaMA 3.2 3B model trained in two stages: initial supervised fine-tuning on
conversational data synthetically generated using medical conversation
strategies, followed by RL with rewards derived from patient understanding
assessments in simulated hospital discharge scenarios. Our evaluation, which
includes comprehensive human-aligned assessments and case studies, demonstrates
that NoteAid-Chatbot exhibits key emergent behaviors critical for patient
education, such as clarity, relevance, and structured dialogue, even though it
received no explicit supervision for these attributes. Our results show that
even simple Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reward modeling can
successfully train lightweight, domain-specific chatbots to handle multi-turn
interactions, incorporate diverse educational strategies, and meet nuanced
communication objectives. Our Turing test demonstrates that NoteAid-Chatbot
surpasses non-expert human. Although our current focus is on healthcare, the
framework we present illustrates the feasibility and promise of applying
low-cost, PPO-based RL to realistic, open-ended conversational domains,
broadening the applicability of RL-based alignment methods.

Conclusion: MapAgent通过分层设计有效解决了地理空间推理中的认知负载和API协调问题，为地理空间AI代理提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Agentic AI has significantly extended the capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) by enabling complex reasoning and tool use. However, most
existing frameworks are tailored to domains such as mathematics, coding, or web
automation, and fall short on geospatial tasks that require spatial reasoning,
multi-hop planning, and real-time map interaction. To address these challenges,
we introduce MapAgent, a hierarchical multi-agent plug-and-play framework with
customized toolsets and agentic scaffolds for map-integrated geospatial
reasoning. Unlike existing flat agent-based approaches that treat tools
uniformly-often overwhelming the LLM when handling similar but subtly different
geospatial APIs-MapAgent decouples planning from execution. A high-level
planner decomposes complex queries into subgoals, which are routed to
specialized modules. For tool-heavy modules-such as map-based services-we then
design a dedicated map-tool agent that efficiently orchestrates related APIs
adaptively in parallel to effectively fetch geospatial data relevant for the
query, while simpler modules (e.g., solution generation or answer extraction)
operate without additional agent overhead. This hierarchical design reduces
cognitive load, improves tool selection accuracy, and enables precise
coordination across similar APIs. We evaluate MapAgent on four diverse
geospatial benchmarks-MapEval-Textual, MapEval-API, MapEval-Visual, and
MapQA-and demonstrate substantial gains over state-of-the-art tool-augmented
and agentic baselines. We open-source our framwork at
https://github.com/Hasebul/MapAgent.

TL;DR: 提出了DRER强化学习奖励框架，通过推理质量奖励和动态长度优势来优化大语言模型的推理能力，在Logictree数据集上取得显著效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于规则的奖励函数只评估答案格式和正确性，无法判断推理链是否真正提升答案质量，且任务特定训练对逻辑深度的控制有限

Method: DRER框架包含：(1)推理质量奖励 - 对提升正确答案概率的推理链给予细粒度奖励；(2)动态长度优势 - 对偏离验证阈值的响应长度进行优势衰减

Result: 7B模型在400训练步数下达到GPT-o3-mini水平，CoT增强答案的平均置信度提升30%，在多个逻辑推理数据集和AIME24数学基准上表现出泛化能力

Conclusion: DRER有效塑造了CoT行为，为增强大语言模型的形式推理能力提供了实用路径

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the dominant paradigm for
strengthening the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Yet the
rule-based reward functions commonly used on mathematical or programming
benchmarks assess only answer format and correctness, providing no signal as to
whether the induced Chain-of-Thought (CoT) actually improves the answer.
Furthermore, such task-specific training offers limited control over logical
depth and therefore may fail to reveal a model's genuine reasoning capacity. We
propose Dynamic Reasoning Efficiency Reward (DRER) -- a plug-and-play RL reward
framework that reshapes both reward and advantage signals. (i) A Reasoning
Quality Reward assigns fine-grained credit to those reasoning chains that
demonstrably raise the likelihood of the correct answer, directly incentivising
the trajectories with beneficial CoT tokens. (ii) A Dynamic Length Advantage
decays the advantage of responses whose length deviates from a
validation-derived threshold, stabilising training. To facilitate rigorous
assessment, we also release Logictree, a dynamically constructed deductive
reasoning dataset that functions both as RL training data and as a
comprehensive benchmark. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of DRER: our 7B
model attains GPT-o3-mini level performance on Logictree with 400 trianing
steps, while the average confidence of CoT-augmented answers rises by 30%. The
model further exhibits generalisation across diverse logical-reasoning
datasets, and the mathematical benchmark AIME24. These results illuminate how
RL shapes CoT behaviour and chart a practical path toward enhancing
formal-reasoning skills in large language models. All code and data are
available in repository https://github.com/Henryhe09/DRER.

Conclusion: REER范式为开放式创造性任务中的深度推理提供了新的可行路径，通过反向工程方法有效解决了传统方法的局限性

Abstract: While the ``deep reasoning'' paradigm has spurred significant advances in
verifiable domains like mathematics, its application to open-ended, creative
generation remains a critical challenge. The two dominant methods for
instilling reasoning -- reinforcement learning (RL) and instruction
distillation -- falter in this area; RL struggles with the absence of clear
reward signals and high-quality reward models, while distillation is
prohibitively expensive and capped by the teacher model's capabilities. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce REverse-Engineered Reasoning (REER), a
new paradigm that fundamentally shifts the approach. Instead of building a
reasoning process ``forwards'' through trial-and-error or imitation, REER works
``backwards'' from known-good solutions to computationally discover the latent,
step-by-step deep reasoning process that could have produced them. Using this
scalable, gradient-free approach, we curate and open-source DeepWriting-20K, a
large-scale dataset of 20,000 deep reasoning trajectories for open-ended tasks.
Our model, DeepWriter-8B, trained on this data, not only surpasses strong
open-source baselines but also achieves performance competitive with, and at
times superior to, leading proprietary models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5.

Conclusion: EDIT有效解决了大型推理模型在平衡多个生成目标(正确性和简洁性)方面的困难，为提升推理模型的效率和实用性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: O1/R1 style large reasoning models (LRMs) signal a substantial leap forward
over conventional instruction-following LLMs. By applying test-time scaling to
generate extended reasoning paths, they establish many SOTAs across a wide
range of complex reasoning tasks. However, recent studies show that LRMs are
prone to suffer from overthinking -- the tendency to overcomplicate simple
problems, leading to excessive strategy switching and long, convoluted
reasoning traces that hinder their interpretability. To mitigate this issue, we
conduct a systematic investigation into the reasoning efficiency of a broad set
of LRMs and uncover a common dilemma: the difficulty in balancing multiple
generation objectives such as correctness and brevity. Based on this discovery,
we propose a test-time scaling method, EDIT (Efficient Dynamic Inference
Trimming), which efficiently guides LRMs to identify the shortest correct
reasoning paths at test time. EDIT employs constraint-guided generation while
jointly tracking length and answer distributions under varying constraints,
allowing it to select responses that strike an optimal balance between
conciseness and correctness. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
datasets show that EDIT substantially enhance the reasoning efficiency,
producing compact yet informative outputs that improve readability and user
experience.

Conclusion: 该工作展示了一个强大、可扩展且自动化的流水线，用于LLM驱动的形式验证硬件合成，连接了自然语言规范和硅实现

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
automated code generation but frequently produce code that fails formal
verification, an essential requirement for hardware and safety-critical
domains. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we previously proposed
PREFACE, a model-agnostic framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) that
iteratively repairs the prompts provided to frozen LLMs, systematically
steering them toward generating formally verifiable Dafny code without costly
fine-tuning. This work presents Proof2Silicon, a novel end-to-end synthesis
framework that embeds the previously proposed PREFACE flow to enable the
generation of correctness-by-construction hardware directly from natural
language specifications. Proof2Silicon operates by: (1) leveraging PREFACE's
verifier-driven RL agent to optimize prompt generation iteratively, ensuring
Dafny code correctness; (2) automatically translating verified Dafny programs
into synthesizable high-level C using Dafny's Python backend and PyLog; and (3)
employing Vivado HLS to produce RTL implementations. Evaluated rigorously on a
challenging 100-task benchmark, PREFACE's RL-guided prompt optimization
consistently improved Dafny verification success rates across diverse LLMs by
up to 21%. Crucially, Proof2Silicon achieved an end-to-end hardware synthesis
success rate of up to 72%, generating RTL designs through Vivado HLS synthesis
flows. These results demonstrate a robust, scalable, and automated pipeline for

Abstract: Personalized AI assistants often struggle to incorporate complex personal

power. We propose REMI, a Causal Schema Memory architecture for a multimodal
lifestyle agent that integrates a personal causal knowledge graph, a causal
reasoning engine, and a schema based planning module. The idea is to deliver
explainable, personalized recommendations in domains like fashion, personal
wellness, and lifestyle planning. Our architecture uses a personal causal graph
of the user's life events and habits, performs goal directed causal traversals
enriched with external knowledge and hypothetical reasoning, and retrieves
adaptable plan schemas to generate tailored action plans. A Large Language
Model orchestrates these components, producing answers with transparent causal
explanations. We outline the CSM system design and introduce new evaluation
metrics for personalization and explainability, including Personalization
Salience Score and Causal Reasoning Accuracy, to rigorously assess its
performance. Results indicate that CSM based agents can provide more context
aware, user aligned recommendations compared to baseline LLM agents. This work
demonstrates a novel approach to memory augmented, causal reasoning in

Motivation: 传统文本方法在复杂数值计算和细粒度操作上表现不佳，现有工具集成方法缺乏真正的自主适应性，需要更灵活的表格推理解决方案。

Method: 采用两阶段微调范式：首先进行监督微调建立有效工具使用模式，然后通过强化微调优化多目标策略，并提出Rank-Aware Policy Optimization (RAPO)方法。

Result: 在多个主流基准测试中，TableMind相比竞争基线实现了卓越性能，在推理准确性和计算精度方面都有显著提升。

Conclusion: TableMind通过自主工具调用、安全代码执行和自适应策略，为表格推理任务提供了有效的解决方案，在准确性和精度方面表现出色。

Abstract: Table reasoning is crucial for leveraging structured data in domains such as
finance, healthcare, and scientific research. While large language models
(LLMs) show promise in multi-step reasoning, purely text-based methods often
struggle with the complex numerical computations and fine-grained operations
inherently required in this task. Tool-integrated reasoning improves
computational accuracy via explicit code execution, yet existing systems
frequently rely on rigid patterns, supervised imitation, and lack true
autonomous adaptability. In this paper, we present TableMind, an LLM-driven
table reasoning agent that (i) autonomously performs multi-turn tool
invocation, (ii) writes and executes data-analyzing code in a secure sandbox
environment for data analysis and precise numerical reasoning, and (iii)
exhibits high-level capabilities such as planning and self-reflection to adapt
strategies. To realize these capabilities, we adopt a two-stage fine-tuning
paradigm built on top of a powerful pre-trained language model: supervised
fine-tuning on high-quality reasoning trajectories to establish effective tool
usage patterns, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning to optimize
multi-objective strategies. In particular, we propose Rank-Aware Policy
Optimization (RAPO), which increases the update weight of high-quality
trajectories when their output probabilities are lower than those of
low-quality ones, thereby guiding the model more consistently toward better and
more accurate answers. Extensive experiments on several mainstream benchmarks
demonstrate that TableMind achieves superior performance compared to
competitive baselines, yielding substantial gains in both reasoning accuracy
and computational precision.

Abstract: Equipping large language models (LLMs) with complex, interleaved reasoning
and tool-use capabilities has become a key focus in agentic AI research,
especially with recent advances in reasoning-oriented (``thinking'') models.
Such capabilities are key to unlocking a number of important applications. One
such application is Deep Research (DR), which requires extensive search and
reasoning over many sources. Our work in this paper focuses on the development
of native Autonomous Single-Agent models for DR featuring minimal web crawling
and Python tool integration. Unlike multi-agent systems, where agents take up
pre-defined roles and are told what to do at each step in a static workflow, an
autonomous single-agent determines its next action dynamically based on
context, without manual directive. While prior work has proposed training
recipes for base or instruction-tuned LLMs, we focus on continual reinforcement
learning (RL) of reasoning-optimized models to further enhance agentic skills
while preserving reasoning ability. Towards this end, we propose a simple RL
recipe with entirely synthetic data, which we apply to various open-source
LLMs. Our best variant SFR-DR-20B achieves up to 28.7% on Humanity's Last Exam
benchmark. In addition, we conduct key analysis experiments to provide more
insights into our methodologies.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型的推理方法依赖隐式探索，导致推理路径不稳定、缺乏错误纠正能力，且无法从过往经验中学习

Method: 从成功轨迹中提取结构化推理模式，从失败中获取反思信号。推理时模型逐步遵循指导原则，每一步后进行细化以纠正错误和稳定推理过程

Result: 在BBH、GSM8K、MATH-500、MBPP、HumanEval等多个基准测试中 consistently outperforms strong baselines

Conclusion: 结构化推理通过逐步执行和细化提高了稳定性和泛化能力，指导原则具有良好的跨域迁移性，支持跨模型协作，在效果和可扩展性上匹配或超越监督微调

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced general-purpose reasoning, showing
strong performance across diverse tasks. However, existing methods often rely
on implicit exploration, where the model follows stochastic and unguided
reasoning paths-like walking without a map. This leads to unstable reasoning
paths, lack of error correction, and limited learning from past experience. To
address these issues, we propose a framework that shifts from implicit
exploration to structured reasoning through guideline and refinement. First, we
extract structured reasoning patterns from successful trajectories and
reflective signals from failures. During inference, the model follows these
guidelines step-by-step, with refinement applied after each step to correct
errors and stabilize the reasoning process. Experiments on BBH and four
additional benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH-500, MBPP, HumanEval) show that our method
consistently outperforms strong baselines across diverse reasoning tasks.
Structured reasoning with stepwise execution and refinement improves stability
and generalization, while guidelines transfer well across domains and flexibly
support cross-model collaboration, matching or surpassing supervised
fine-tuning in effectiveness and scalability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究评估了7种大型语言模型在住宅能源改造决策中的表现，发现LLMs在技术目标（最大化CO2减排）上表现更好，最高可达54.5%的top1匹配率，但在社会技术目标（最小化投资回收期）上受限于经济权衡和本地背景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统建筑能源改造决策方法存在泛化性有限和可解释性低的问题，阻碍了在不同住宅环境中的采用。随着智能连接社区的发展，生成式AI特别是大型语言模型可能通过处理上下文信息来提供可读的建议。

Method: 评估了7种LLMs（ChatGPT、DeepSeek、Gemini、Grok、Llama和Claude）在住宅改造决策中的表现，使用包含49个美国州400个住宅的数据集，从准确性、一致性、敏感性和推理能力四个维度进行评估。

Result: LLMs在许多情况下能生成有效建议，未经微调即可达到54.5%的top1匹配率和92.8%的top5匹配率。模型间一致性较低，高性能模型往往与其他模型不同。对位置和建筑几何形状敏感，但对技术和居住者行为不太敏感。

Conclusion: LLMs在能源改造决策中是有前途的助手，但在准确性、一致性和上下文处理方面需要改进才能可靠应用于实践。

Abstract: Conventional approaches to building energy retrofit decision making suffer
from limited generalizability and low interpretability, hindering adoption in
diverse residential contexts. With the growth of Smart and Connected
Communities, generative AI, especially large language models (LLMs), may help
by processing contextual information and producing practitioner readable
recommendations. We evaluate seven LLMs (ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok,
Llama, and Claude) on residential retrofit decisions under two objectives:
maximizing CO2 reduction (technical) and minimizing payback period
(sociotechnical). Performance is assessed on four dimensions: accuracy,
consistency, sensitivity, and reasoning, using a dataset of 400 homes across 49
US states. LLMs generate effective recommendations in many cases, reaching up
to 54.5 percent top 1 match and 92.8 percent within top 5 without fine tuning.
Performance is stronger for the technical objective, while sociotechnical
decisions are limited by economic trade offs and local context. Agreement
across models is low, and higher performing models tend to diverge from others.
LLMs are sensitive to location and building geometry but less sensitive to
technology and occupant behavior. Most models show step by step, engineering
style reasoning, but it is often simplified and lacks deeper contextual
awareness. Overall, LLMs are promising assistants for energy retrofit decision
making, but improvements in accuracy, consistency, and context handling are
needed for reliable practice.

Abstract: Questionnaire-based surveys are foundational to social science research and
public policymaking, yet traditional survey methods remain costly,
time-consuming, and often limited in scale. This paper explores a new paradigm:
simulating virtual survey respondents using Large Language Models (LLMs). We
introduce two novel simulation settings, namely Partial Attribute Simulation
(PAS) and Full Attribute Simulation (FAS), to systematically evaluate the
ability of LLMs to generate accurate and demographically coherent responses. In
PAS, the model predicts missing attributes based on partial respondent
profiles, whereas FAS involves generating complete synthetic datasets under
both zero-context and context-enhanced conditions. We curate a comprehensive
benchmark suite, LLM-S^3 (Large Language Model-based Sociodemographic Survey
Simulation), that spans 11 real-world public datasets across four sociological
domains. Our evaluation of multiple mainstream LLMs (GPT-3.5/4 Turbo, LLaMA
3.0/3.1-8B) reveals consistent trends in prediction performance, highlights
failure modes, and demonstrates how context and prompt design impact simulation
fidelity. This work establishes a rigorous foundation for LLM-driven survey
simulations, offering scalable and cost-effective tools for sociological
research and policy evaluation. Our code and dataset are available at:

Motivation: 在线二手市场中，多轮议价是买卖双方互动的关键环节。LLM可以作为卖家代理在商业约束下与买家谈判，但需要准确跟踪和理解长期谈判中的累积买家意图，这直接影响议价效果。

Method: 1) 构建大规模电子商务议价基准数据集（622个类别、9,892个产品、3,014个任务）；2) 开发基于心理理论的轮级评估框架，包含标注的买家意图；3) 设计自动化流程从海量对话数据中提取可靠意图。

Conclusion: 该框架为评估LLM卖家代理的议价能力提供了有效工具，特别强调了意图跟踪和理解在长期多轮谈判中的重要性。

Abstract: In online second-hand marketplaces, multi-turn bargaining is a crucial part
of seller-buyer interactions. Large Language Models (LLMs) can act as seller
agents, negotiating with buyers on behalf of sellers under given business
constraints. A critical ability for such agents is to track and accurately
interpret cumulative buyer intents across long negotiations, which directly
impacts bargaining effectiveness. We introduce a multi-turn evaluation
framework for measuring the bargaining ability of seller agents in e-commerce
dialogues. The framework tests whether an agent can extract and track buyer
intents. Our contributions are: (1) a large-scale e-commerce bargaining
benchmark spanning 622 categories, 9,892 products, and 3,014 tasks; (2) a
turn-level evaluation framework grounded in Theory of Mind (ToM) with annotated
buyer intents, moving beyond outcome-only metrics; and (3) an automated
pipeline that extracts reliable intent from massive dialogue data.

Abstract: Modern simulation environments for complex multi-agent interactions must
balance high-fidelity detail with computational efficiency. We present DECOY, a
novel multi-agent simulator that abstracts strategic, long-horizon planning in
3D terrains into high-level discretized simulation while preserving low-level
environmental fidelity. Using Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) as a
testbed, our framework accurately simulates gameplay using only movement
decisions as tactical positioning -- without explicitly modeling low-level
mechanics such as aiming and shooting. Central to our approach is a waypoint
system that simplifies and discretizes continuous states and actions, paired
with neural predictive and generative models trained on real CS:GO tournament
data to reconstruct event outcomes. Extensive evaluations show that replays
generated from human data in DECOY closely match those observed in the original
game. Our publicly available simulation environment provides a valuable tool
for advancing research in strategic multi-agent planning and behavior
generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型处理长上下文任务时的核心挑战——'中间信息丢失'问题，现有方法要么有丢弃关键信息的风险，要么导致注意力分散。

Method: TOA框架将输入分段由独立智能体处理，每个智能体生成局部认知，然后沿树状结构路径动态交换信息进行协作推理，结合前缀哈希缓存和自适应剪枝策略提高效率。

Result: 实验表明，基于紧凑LLaMA3.1-8B的TOA显著优于多个基线，并在各种长上下文任务上达到与最新大型商业模型（如Gemini1.5-pro）相当的性能。

Conclusion: TOA通过多智能体协作推理有效缓解位置偏见和减少幻觉，为长上下文处理提供了高效且性能优异的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face persistent challenges when handling
long-context tasks, most notably the lost in the middle issue, where
information located in the middle of a long input tends to be underutilized.
Some existing methods that reduce input have the risk of discarding key
information, while others that extend context windows often lead to attention
dispersion. To address these limitations, we propose Tree of Agents (TOA), a
multi-agent reasoning framework that segments the input into chunks processed
by independent agents. Each agent generates its local cognition, then agents
dynamically exchange information for collaborative reasoning along
tree-structured paths. TOA enables agents to probe different reasoning orders
for multi-perspective understanding, effectively mitigating position bias and
reducing hallucinations. To improve processing efficiency, we incorporate
prefix-hash caching and adaptive pruning strategies, achieving significant
performance improvements with comparable API overhead. Experiments show that
TOA, powered by compact LLaMA3.1-8B, significantly outperforms multiple
baselines and demonstrates comparable performance to the latest and much larger
commercial models, such as Gemini1.5-pro, on various long-context tasks. Code

Motivation: 集中式RAG系统在处理异构和隐私敏感数据时存在困难，特别是在分布式医疗环境中，患者数据分布在SQL、知识图谱和临床笔记等多种格式中，且受隐私约束限制，临床医生难以检索罕见病例。

Method: 基于Flower设计边缘-云协作RAG框架，边缘侧LLM将异构数据转换为标准化隐私保护表示，服务器侧LLM进行全局推理和生成；集成轻量级本地检索器和隐私感知LLM，提供三种匿名化工具；设计三层缓存策略优化延迟和计算效率。

Result: 在PMC-Patients数据集上的实验表明，HyFedRAG在检索质量、生成一致性和系统效率方面优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为结构化异构数据上的RAG提供了可扩展且符合隐私要求的解决方案，在敏感和多样化数据环境中释放了LLMs的潜力。

Abstract: Centralized RAG pipelines struggle with heterogeneous and privacy-sensitive
data, especially in distributed healthcare settings where patient data spans
SQL, knowledge graphs, and clinical notes. Clinicians face difficulties
retrieving rare disease cases due to privacy constraints and the limitations of
traditional cloud-based RAG systems in handling diverse formats and edge
devices. To address this, we introduce HyFedRAG, a unified and efficient
Federated RAG framework tailored for Hybrid data modalities. By leveraging an
edge-cloud collaborative mechanism, HyFedRAG enables RAG to operate across
diverse data sources while preserving data privacy. Our key contributions are:
(1) We design an edge-cloud collaborative RAG framework built on Flower, which
supports querying structured SQL data, semi-structured knowledge graphs, and
unstructured documents. The edge-side LLMs convert diverse data into
standardized privacy-preserving representations, and the server-side LLMs
integrates them for global reasoning and generation. (2) We integrate
lightweight local retrievers with privacy-aware LLMs and provide three
anonymization tools that enable each client to produce semantically rich,
de-identified summaries for global inference across devices. (3) To optimize
response latency and reduce redundant computation, we design a three-tier
caching strategy consisting of local cache, intermediate representation cache,
and cloud inference cache. Experimental results on PMC-Patients demonstrate
that HyFedRAG outperforms existing baselines in terms of retrieval quality,
generation consistency, and system efficiency. Our framework offers a scalable
and privacy-compliant solution for RAG over structural-heterogeneous data,
unlocking the potential of LLMs in sensitive and diverse data environments.

Method: 首先研究指令数据集分布与对齐模型性能关系的关键因素，发现指令深度和语义空间覆盖是决定下游性能的关键因素。然后设计了一种指令选择算法，同时最大化所选指令的深度和语义覆盖。

Result: 实验结果表明，相比最先进的基线方法，该方法能够以更快的速度持续提升模型性能，实现"加速扩展"，能够解释开发集上超过70%的模型损失。

Conclusion: 指令深度和语义覆盖是影响对齐模型性能的关键因素，提出的指令选择方法能够有效解决指令池扩展时的性能提升问题。

Abstract: With the growing demand for applying large language models to downstream
tasks, improving model alignment performance and efficiency has become crucial.
Such a process involves selecting informative instructions from a candidate
pool. However, due to the complexity of instruction set distributions, the key
factors driving the performance of aligned models remain unclear. As a result,
current instruction set refinement methods fail to improve performance as the
instruction pool expands continuously. To address this issue, we first
investigate the key factors that influence the relationship between instruction
dataset distribution and aligned model performance. Based on these insights, we
propose a novel instruction data selection method. We identify that the depth
of instructions and the coverage of the semantic space are the crucial factors
determining downstream performance, which could explain over 70\% of the model
loss on the development set. We then design an instruction selection algorithm
to simultaneously maximize the depth and semantic coverage of the selected
instructions. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to
state-of-the-art baseline methods, it can sustainably improve model performance
at a faster pace and thus achieve \emph{``Accelerated Scaling''}.

Abstract: To enhance the efficiency of GUI agents on various platforms like smartphones
and computers, a hybrid paradigm that combines flexible GUI operations with
efficient shortcuts (e.g., API, deep links) is emerging as a promising
direction. However, a framework for systematically benchmarking these hybrid
agents is still underexplored. To take the first step in bridging this gap, we
introduce MAS-Bench, a benchmark that pioneers the evaluation of GUI-shortcut
hybrid agents with a specific focus on the mobile domain. Beyond merely using
predefined shortcuts, MAS-Bench assesses an agent's capability to autonomously
generate shortcuts by discovering and creating reusable, low-cost workflows. It
features 139 complex tasks across 11 real-world applications, a knowledge base
of 88 predefined shortcuts (APIs, deep-links, RPA scripts), and 7 evaluation
metrics. The tasks are designed to be solvable via GUI-only operations, but can
be significantly accelerated by intelligently embedding shortcuts. Experiments
show that hybrid agents achieve significantly higher success rates and
efficiency than their GUI-only counterparts. This result also demonstrates the
effectiveness of our method for evaluating an agent's shortcut generation
capabilities. MAS-Bench fills a critical evaluation gap, providing a
foundational platform for future advancements in creating more efficient and
robust intelligent agents.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了决策效率，还为管理不确定性和优化供应链性能提供了更稳健的框架

Abstract: In supply chain management, decision-making often involves balancing multiple
conflicting objectives, such as cost reduction, service level improvement, and
environmental sustainability. Traditional multi-objective optimization methods,
such as linear programming and evolutionary algorithms, struggle to adapt in
real-time to the dynamic nature of supply chains. In this paper, we propose an
approach that combines Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Multi-Objective
Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) to address these challenges for dynamic
multi-objective optimization under uncertainty. Our method leverages MOEAs to
search the parameter space of policy neural networks, generating a Pareto front
of policies. This provides decision-makers with a diverse population of
policies that can be dynamically switched based on the current system
objectives, ensuring flexibility and adaptability in real-time decision-making.
We also introduce Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) to incorporate
risk-sensitive decision-making, enhancing resilience in uncertain environments.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through case studies,
showcasing its ability to respond to supply chain dynamics and outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in an inventory management case study. The proposed
strategy not only improves decision-making efficiency but also offers a more
robust framework for managing uncertainty and optimizing performance in supply
chains.

continually improving the performance of LLM step-prover at training time. This
framework, inspired by the principles of AlphaZero, utilizes a multi-stage
expert iteration pipeline featuring adaptive tactic-level data filtering and
periodic retraining to surmount the performance plateaus that typically curtail
long-term RL in LLM-based agents. The second innovation is a planner-enhanced
multi-agent search architecture that scales reasoning capabilities at inference
time. This architecture employs a general reasoning model as a high-level
planner to iteratively decompose complex theorems into a sequence of simpler
subgoals. This hierarchical approach substantially reduces the search space,
enabling a team of parallel prover agents to collaborate efficiently by
leveraging a shared proof cache. We demonstrate that this dual approach to
scaling yields state-of-the-art results on established formal mathematics
benchmarks. \texttt{BFS-Prover-V2} achieves 95.08\% and 41.4\% on the MiniF2F
and ProofNet test sets respectively. While demonstrated in the domain of formal
mathematics, the RL and inference techniques presented in this work are of
broader interest and may be applied to other domains requiring long-horizon
multi-turn reasoning and complex search.

Abstract: The cycle of scientific discovery is frequently bottlenecked by the slow,
manual creation of software to support computational experiments. To address
this, we present an AI system that creates expert-level scientific software
whose goal is to maximize a quality metric. The system uses a Large Language
Model (LLM) and Tree Search (TS) to systematically improve the quality metric
and intelligently navigate the large space of possible solutions. The system
achieves expert-level results when it explores and integrates complex research
ideas from external sources. The effectiveness of tree search is demonstrated
across a wide range of benchmarks. In bioinformatics, it discovered 40 novel
methods for single-cell data analysis that outperformed the top human-developed
methods on a public leaderboard. In epidemiology, it generated 14 models that
outperformed the CDC ensemble and all other individual models for forecasting
COVID-19 hospitalizations. Our method also produced state-of-the-art software
for geospatial analysis, neural activity prediction in zebrafish, time series
forecasting and numerical solution of integrals. By devising and implementing
novel solutions to diverse tasks, the system represents a significant step
towards accelerating scientific progress.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种以"意图草笼"为核心的零样本多模态推理组件，通过模仿人类认知策略来解决多模态大模型中的"路径短截"和上下文理解不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标是解决多模态大模型在复杂跨模态推理中存在的"路径短截"问题和上下文理解不充分的问题，提高模型的认知理解能力。

Method: 设计了一个即插即用的三模块流水线：意图感知器、策略生成器和策略选择器，显式构建"理解-规划-选择"的认知过程，通过生成和筛选"意图草笼"策略来指导最终推理。

Result: 在IntentBench、WorldSense和Daily-Omni数据集上验证了方法的普遍性和稳健性，相比各自基线，完整的"三模块"方案在不同推理引擎和流水线组合中均实现了一致提升，最高提升约9.51个百分点。

Conclusion: 该方法通过信息论分析证明能够降低条件熵和提高信息利用效率，压制意外的短截推理，在零样本场景中具有实际价值和可移植性。

Abstract: Targeting the issues of "shortcuts" and insufficient contextual understanding
in complex cross-modal reasoning of multimodal large models, this paper
proposes a zero-shot multimodal reasoning component guided by human-like
cognitive strategies centered on an "intent sketch". The component comprises a
plug-and-play three-module pipeline-Intent Perceiver, Strategy Generator, and
Strategy Selector-that explicitly constructs a "understand-plan-select"
cognitive process. By generating and filtering "intent sketch" strategies to
guide the final reasoning, it requires no parameter fine-tuning and achieves
cross-model transfer solely through in-context engineering.
Information-theoretic analysis shows that this process can reduce conditional
entropy and improve information utilization efficiency, thereby suppressing
unintended shortcut reasoning. Experiments on IntentBench, WorldSense, and
Daily-Omni validate the method's generality and robust gains; compared with
their respective baselines, the complete "three-module" scheme yields
consistent improvements across different reasoning engines and pipeline
combinations, with gains up to approximately 9.51 percentage points,
demonstrating the practical value and portability of the "intent sketch"
reasoning component in zero-shot scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文是首个专注于深度搜索系统RL基础的综述，系统化了从DeepSeek-R1后的研究进展，包括数据合成、RL方法、训练系统等多个轴心，为基于RL的潜在研究组件提供实践指南。


<details>

Motivation: 目前深度搜索系统主要依赖SFT和DPO方法，但这些方法存在模仿偏差、暴露偏差、代理依赖、远视野信赏分配困难等问题，而强化学习能够优化轨迹级攻略、支持探索和恢复行为、减少对人类先验知识的依赖。

Conclusion: 本综述为基于强化学习训练健壮、透明的深度搜索代理提供了实践指南，强调了RL在解决现有SFT和DPO方法局限性方面的潜力，并系统化了该领域的研究进展。

Abstract: Deep research systems, agentic AI that solve complex, multi-step tasks by
coordinating reasoning, search across the open web and user files, and tool
use, are moving toward hierarchical deployments with a Planner, Coordinator,
and Executors. In practice, training entire stacks end-to-end remains
impractical, so most work trains a single planner connected to core tools such
as search, browsing, and code. While SFT imparts protocol fidelity, it suffers
from imitation and exposure biases and underuses environment feedback.
Preference alignment methods such as DPO are schema and proxy-dependent,
off-policy, and weak for long-horizon credit assignment and multi-objective
trade-offs. A further limitation of SFT and DPO is their reliance on human
defined decision points and subskills through schema design and labeled
comparisons. Reinforcement learning aligns with closed-loop, tool-interaction
research by optimizing trajectory-level policies, enabling exploration,
recovery behaviors, and principled credit assignment, and it reduces dependence
on such human priors and rater biases.
  This survey is, to our knowledge, the first dedicated to the RL foundations
of deep research systems. It systematizes work after DeepSeek-R1 along three
axes: (i) data synthesis and curation; (ii) RL methods for agentic research
covering stability, sample efficiency, long context handling, reward and credit
design, multi-objective optimization, and multimodal integration; and (iii)
agentic RL training systems and frameworks. We also cover agent architecture
and coordination, as well as evaluation and benchmarks, including recent QA,
VQA, long-form synthesis, and domain-grounded, tool-interaction tasks. We
distill recurring patterns, surface infrastructure bottlenecks, and offer
practical guidance for training robust, transparent deep research agents with
RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能座舱环境复杂，传统函数调用方法需要多次探索性调用来构建环境认知，导致效率低下和错误恢复能力有限

Method: 开发了VehicleWorld环境（30个模块、250个API、680个属性），并提出SFC方法，通过维护显式系统状态感知和实现直接状态转换来达到目标条件

Result: SFC方法显著优于传统FC方法，实现了更高的执行准确性和更低的延迟

Conclusion: 状态预测比函数调用更适合环境控制，SFC方法为车载智能系统提供了更高效的解决方案

Abstract: Intelligent vehicle cockpits present unique challenges for API Agents,
requiring coordination across tightly-coupled subsystems that exceed typical
task environments' complexity. Traditional Function Calling (FC) approaches
operate statelessly, requiring multiple exploratory calls to build
environmental awareness before execution, leading to inefficiency and limited
error recovery. We introduce VehicleWorld, the first comprehensive environment
for the automotive domain, featuring 30 modules, 250 APIs, and 680 properties
with fully executable implementations that provide real-time state information
during agent execution. This environment enables precise evaluation of vehicle
agent behaviors across diverse, challenging scenarios. Through systematic
analysis, we discovered that direct state prediction outperforms function
calling for environmental control. Building on this insight, we propose
State-based Function Call (SFC), a novel approach that maintains explicit
system state awareness and implements direct state transitions to achieve
target conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that SFC significantly
outperforms traditional FC approaches, achieving superior execution accuracy
and reduced latency. We have made all implementation code publicly available on
Github https://github.com/OpenMOSS/VehicleWorld.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个评估大语言模型迭代精细化能力的框架，通过12轮对话测试不同领域（思想创造、代码、数学）中迭代的效果，发现不同领域的迭代模式和效果存在显著差异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型被广泛用于多轮工作流程，但仍缺乏明确的方法来评估迭代精细化在什么情况下有效或无效

Method: 设计12轮控制对话测试，使用从模糊"改进它"到有针对性指导的多种提示策略，采用领域适当的评分标准（代码单元测试、数学答案等价性和推理合理性、思想的原创性和可行性），并跟踪轮次行为按三类指标

Result: 在不同模型和任务中，收益具有领域依赖性：思想和代码在早期轮次就有收获，而数学需要后期详细迭代才能获得收益。模糊反馈往往在前几轮后就平台化或导致结果逆转，而有针对性的提示能可靠地提升指定质量轴心

Conclusion: 该框架和指标使得迭代过程可以裁量和跨模型比较，并为何时进行指导、停止或更换策略提供信号

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now used in multi-turn workflows, but we
still lack a clear way to measure when iteration helps and when it hurts. We
present an evaluation framework for iterative refinement that spans ideation,
code, and math. Our protocol runs controlled 12-turn conversations per task,
utilizing a variety of prompts ranging from vague ``improve it'' feedback to
targeted steering, and logs per-turn outputs. We score outcomes with
domain-appropriate checks (unit tests for code; answer-equivalence plus
reasoning-soundness for math; originality and feasibility for ideation) and
track turn-level behavior with three families of metrics: semantic movement
across turns, turn-to-turn change, and output size growth. Across models and
tasks, gains are domain-dependent: they arrive early in ideas and code, but in
math late turns matter when guided by elaboration. After the first few turns,
vague feedback often plateaus or reverses correctness, while targeted prompts
reliably shift the intended quality axis (novelty vs. feasibility in ideation;
speed vs. readability in code; in math, elaboration outperforms exploration and
drives late-turn gains). We also observe consistent domain patterns: ideation
moves more in meaning across turns, code tends to grow in size with little
semantic change, and math starts fixed but can break that path with late,
elaborative iteration.Together, the framework and metrics make iteration
measurable and comparable across models, and signal when to steer, stop, or
switch strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理系统评估方法存在局限，主要关注单一指标或端到端结果，难以识别复杂长时程系统中故障的具体位置和原因，需要能够推理、探测和迭代理解的评估框架

Method: RAFFLES采用迭代式多组件流水线架构，包含中央Judge系统调查故障，以及专门Evaluators评估系统组件和Judge自身推理质量，建立假设历史

Result: 在Who&When数据集上，RAFFLES在算法生成数据集上达到43%的代理-步骤故障对准确率（之前最佳为16.6%），在手写数据集上达到20%（之前最佳为8.8%）

Conclusion: RAFFLES代表了向自动化故障检测迈出的关键一步，能够替代劳动密集型的人工审查，显著提升长时程多组件LLM代理系统的故障诊断能力

Abstract: We have reached a critical roadblock in the development and enhancement of
long-horizon, multi-component LLM agentic systems: it is incredibly tricky to
identify where these systems break down and why. Evaluation capabilities that
currently exist today (e.g., single pass LLM-as-a-judge) are limited in that
they often focus on individual metrics or capabilities, end-to-end outcomes,
and are narrowly grounded on the preferences of humans. We argue that to match
the agentic capabilities, evaluation frameworks must also be able to reason,
probe, iterate, and understand the complex logic passing through these systems
over long horizons. In this paper, we present RAFFLES - an evaluation
architecture that incorporates reasoning and iterative refinement.
Specifically, RAFFLES operates as an iterative, multi-component pipeline, using
a central Judge to systematically investigate faults and a set of specialized
Evaluators to assess not only the system's components but also the quality of
the reasoning by the Judge itself, thereby building a history of hypotheses. We
tested RAFFLES against several baselines on the Who&When dataset, a benchmark
designed to diagnose the "who" (agent) and "when" (step) of a system's failure.
RAFFLES outperforms these baselines, achieving an agent-step fault pair
accuracy of over 43% on the Algorithmically-Generated dataset (a substantial
increase from the previously published best of 16.6%) and over 20% on the
Hand-Crafted dataset (surpassing the previously published best of 8.8%). These
results demonstrate a key step towards introducing automated fault detection
for autonomous systems over labor-intensive manual human review.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查测试时扩展推理链方法在知识密集任务上的效果，因为这类任务需要高准确性和低幻觉率。

Method: 使用12个推理模型在两个知识密集测试集上进行综合评估，分析扩展推理如何影响幻觉行为。

Result: 增加测试时计算并不能持续提高准确性，反而在许多情况下导致更多幻觉。减少的幻觉多数是模型选择放弃回答，而非改善事实记忆。

Conclusion: 尽管有限制，但与不进行推理相比，启用推理仍然有益。扩展推理可能引发确认偏见，导致过于自信的幻觉。

Abstract: Test-time scaling increases inference-time computation by allowing models to
generate long reasoning chains, and has shown strong performance across many
domains. However, in this work, we show that this approach is not yet effective
for knowledge-intensive tasks, where high factual accuracy and low
hallucination rates are essential. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
test-time scaling using 12 reasoning models on two knowledge-intensive
benchmarks. Our results reveal that increasing test-time computation does not
consistently improve accuracy and, in many cases, it even leads to more
hallucinations. We then analyze how extended reasoning affects hallucination
behavior. We find that reduced hallucinations often result from the model
choosing to abstain after thinking more, rather than from improved factual
recall. Conversely, for some models, longer reasoning encourages attempts on
previously unanswered questions, many of which result in hallucinations. Case
studies show that extended reasoning can induce confirmation bias, leading to
overconfident hallucinations. Despite these limitations, we observe that
compared to non-thinking, enabling thinking remains beneficial. Code and data

Motivation: 传统研究论文需要读者投入大量精力来理解和适应代码、数据和方法，这造成了传播和重用的障碍。Paper2Agent旨在将研究成果从被动产物转变为主动系统，加速下游使用、采用和发现。

Method: 使用多代理系统分析论文和关联代码库，构建模型上下文协议(MCP)服务器，通过迭代生成和运行测试来优化MCP。生成的MCP可以灵活连接到聊天代理(如Claude Code)，通过自然语言执行复杂科学查询并调用原始论文的工具和工作流。

Conclusion: Paper2Agent通过将静态论文转变为动态交互式AI代理，为知识传播引入了新范式，并为AI合作科学家生态系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: We introduce Paper2Agent, an automated framework that converts research
papers into AI agents. Paper2Agent transforms research output from passive
artifacts into active systems that can accelerate downstream use, adoption, and
discovery. Conventional research papers require readers to invest substantial
effort to understand and adapt a paper's code, data, and methods to their own
work, creating barriers to dissemination and reuse. Paper2Agent addresses this
challenge by automatically converting a paper into an AI agent that acts as a
knowledgeable research assistant. It systematically analyzes the paper and the
associated codebase using multiple agents to construct a Model Context Protocol
(MCP) server, then iteratively generates and runs tests to refine and robustify
the resulting MCP. These paper MCPs can then be flexibly connected to a chat
agent (e.g. Claude Code) to carry out complex scientific queries through
natural language while invoking tools and workflows from the original paper. We
demonstrate Paper2Agent's effectiveness in creating reliable and capable paper
agents through in-depth case studies. Paper2Agent created an agent that
leverages AlphaGenome to interpret genomic variants and agents based on ScanPy
and TISSUE to carry out single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses. We
validate that these paper agents can reproduce the original paper's results and
can correctly carry out novel user queries. By turning static papers into
dynamic, interactive AI agents, Paper2Agent introduces a new paradigm for
knowledge dissemination and a foundation for the collaborative ecosystem of AI
co-scientists.

Method: 提出Direct-Align方法，通过预定义噪声前矢量来恢复原始图像，避免后期时间步过度优化。同时提出语义相对偏好优化(SRPO)，将奖励形式化为文本条件信号，支持在线调整奖励。

Result: 在FLUX.1.dev模型上进行精调，人类评估的真实性和美学质量提升了3倍以上。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了漏涼模型对齐中的计算效率和奖励调整问题，显著提高了生成图像的质量。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of directly aligning
diffusion models with human preferences using differentiable reward. However,
they exhibit two primary challenges: (1) they rely on multistep denoising with
gradient computation for reward scoring, which is computationally expensive,
thus restricting optimization to only a few diffusion steps; (2) they often
need continuous offline adaptation of reward models in order to achieve desired
aesthetic quality, such as photorealism or precise lighting effects. To address
the limitation of multistep denoising, we propose Direct-Align, a method that
predefines a noise prior to effectively recover original images from any time
steps via interpolation, leveraging the equation that diffusion states are
interpolations between noise and target images, which effectively avoids
over-optimization in late timesteps. Furthermore, we introduce Semantic
Relative Preference Optimization (SRPO), in which rewards are formulated as
text-conditioned signals. This approach enables online adjustment of rewards in
response to positive and negative prompt augmentation, thereby reducing the
reliance on offline reward fine-tuning. By fine-tuning the FLUX.1.dev model
with optimized denoising and online reward adjustment, we improve its
human-evaluated realism and aesthetic quality by over 3x.

Motivation: 现有的LLM遗忘学习基准通常只使用单一邻居集和通用知识集，未能反映真实世界数据的复杂性，且标准采样方法的有效性和稳定性未经严格检验。

Method: 通过系统评估现有实践，提出并验证最佳实践：包含多样化邻居集、避免标准1:1采样、采用模块化实体级遗忘(MELU)策略替代循环采样。

Result: 研究发现单一邻居集次优，标准采样方法会掩盖性能权衡。模块化方法结合鲁棒算法为有效遗忘提供了清晰稳定的路径。

Conclusion: 需要采用多样化邻居集和模块化遗忘策略来平衡遗忘效果和模型效用，标准采样方法效率低下且效果不佳。

Abstract: A conventional LLM Unlearning setting consists of two subsets -"forget" and
"retain", with the objectives of removing the undesired knowledge from the
forget set while preserving the remaining knowledge from the retain. In
privacy-focused unlearning research, a retain set is often further divided into
neighbor sets, containing either directly or indirectly connected to the forget
targets; and augmented by a general-knowledge set. A common practice in
existing benchmarks is to employ only a single neighbor set, with general
knowledge which fails to reflect the real-world data complexities and
relationships. LLM Unlearning typically involves 1:1 sampling or cyclic
iteration sampling. However, the efficacy and stability of these de facto
standards have not been critically examined. In this study, we systematically
evaluate these common practices. Our findings reveal that relying on a single
neighbor set is suboptimal and that a standard sampling approach can obscure
performance trade-offs. Based on this analysis, we propose and validate an
initial set of best practices: (1) Incorporation of diverse neighbor sets to
balance forget efficacy and model utility, (2) Standard 1:1 sampling methods
are inefficient and yield poor results, (3) Our proposed Modular Entity-Level
Unlearning (MELU) strategy as an alternative to cyclic sampling. We demonstrate
that this modular approach, combined with robust algorithms, provides a clear
and stable path towards effective unlearning.

Motivation: 现有的鲁棒微调方法无法在不同模型架构中一致提升OOD鲁棒性，因为它们只是预训练权重、特征或logits的代理，而非直接在函数空间中进行优化。

Method: 提出函数空间距离正则化，使用模拟OOD样本来约束微调模型与预训练模型的距离；引入一致性正则化来促进扰动样本的稳定预测。

Result: 在多种CLIP骨干网络上，该方法能够一致地提升下游任务的ID性能和OOD鲁棒性，优于现有的基于正则化的鲁棒微调方法。

Conclusion: 通过在函数空间中进行直接约束，结合一致性正则化，能够有效保持预训练模型的OOD鲁棒性，同时获得良好的下游任务性能。

Abstract: Robust fine-tuning aims to achieve competitive in-distribution (ID)
performance while maintaining the out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness of a
pre-trained model when transferring it to a downstream task. To remedy this,
most robust fine-tuning methods aim to preserve the pretrained weights,
features, or logits. However, we find that these methods cannot always improve
OOD robustness for different model architectures. This is due to the OOD
robustness requiring the model function to produce stable prediction for input
information of downstream tasks, while existing methods might serve as a poor
proxy for the optimization in the function space. Based on this finding, we
propose a novel regularization that constrains the distance of fine-tuning and
pre-trained model in the function space with the simulated OOD samples, aiming
to preserve the OOD robustness of the pre-trained model. Besides, to further
enhance the OOD robustness capability of the fine-tuning model, we introduce an
additional consistency regularization to promote stable predictions of
perturbed samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach could
consistently improve both downstream task ID fine-tuning performance and OOD
robustness across a variety of CLIP backbones, outperforming existing
regularization-based robust fine-tuning methods.

TL;DR: 本文研究了GNN中的拓扑隐私风险，提出了拓扑推断攻击(TIAs)并发现现有边级差分隐私机制不足，进而提出了保护拓扑隐私的新防御框架PGR。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN在图形数据学习方面表现出强大能力，但其广泛应用引发了严重的隐私问题。先前研究主要关注边级隐私，而拓扑隐私（图整体结构的保密性）这一关键威胁尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 提出了拓扑推断攻击(TIAs)来重建目标训练图结构，仅需黑盒访问GNN模型。为应对此挑战，提出了Private Graph Reconstruction (PGR)防御框架，采用双层优化问题形式，通过元梯度迭代生成合成训练图，并基于演化图同时更新GNN模型。

Result: 研究发现GNN对这些攻击高度脆弱，现有边级差分隐私机制要么无法缓解风险，要么严重损害模型准确性。PGR显著减少了拓扑泄露，同时对模型准确性的影响最小。

Conclusion: 拓扑隐私是GNN中一个重要但被忽视的安全问题，PGR框架有效解决了这一挑战，在保护拓扑隐私的同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful models for learning
from graph-structured data. However, their widespread adoption has raised
serious privacy concerns. While prior research has primarily focused on
edge-level privacy, a critical yet underexplored threat lies in topology
privacy - the confidentiality of the graph's overall structure. In this work,
we present a comprehensive study on topology privacy risks in GNNs, revealing
their vulnerability to graph-level inference attacks. To this end, we propose a
suite of Topology Inference Attacks (TIAs) that can reconstruct the structure
of a target training graph using only black-box access to a GNN model. Our
findings show that GNNs are highly susceptible to these attacks, and that
existing edge-level differential privacy mechanisms are insufficient as they
either fail to mitigate the risk or severely compromise model accuracy. To
address this challenge, we introduce Private Graph Reconstruction (PGR), a
novel defense framework designed to protect topology privacy while maintaining
model accuracy. PGR is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem, where a
synthetic training graph is iteratively generated using meta-gradients, and the
GNN model is concurrently updated based on the evolving graph. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PGR significantly reduces topology leakage with
minimal impact on model accuracy. Our code is anonymously available at

TL;DR: 这是一个用于评估去中心化梯度市场中精强聚合方法的综合性基准框架，重点考虑了经济效益、公平性和市场稳定性等因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习基准忽视了去中心化梯度市场中的关键经济和系统因素，如成本效益、卖家公平性和市场稳定性，尤其是当买家依赖私有基准数据集进行评估时。

Method: 提出了一个包含（1）模拟环境模型市场动态，（2）增强标准FL指标的评估方法，（3）对MartFL框架进行深入实证分析的综合性基准框架。

Result: 该基准框架提供了在多样化数据集、本地攻击和Sybil攻击场景下的评估结果，以及模型性能、精强性、成本、公平性和稳定性之间的权衡见解。

Conclusion: 这个基准框架为社区提供了重要工具和实证证据，以评估和设计更精强、更公平且经济可行的去中心化梯度市场。

Abstract: The rise of distributed and privacy-preserving machine learning has sparked
interest in decentralized gradient marketplaces, where participants trade
intermediate artifacts like gradients. However, existing Federated Learning
(FL) benchmarks overlook critical economic and systemic factors unique to such
marketplaces-cost-effectiveness, fairness to sellers, and market
stability-especially when a buyer relies on a private baseline dataset for
evaluation.
  We introduce a comprehensive benchmark framework to holistically evaluate
robust gradient aggregation methods within these buyer-baseline-reliant
marketplaces. Our contributions include: (1) a simulation environment modeling
marketplace dynamics with a variable buyer baseline and diverse seller
distributions; (2) an evaluation methodology augmenting standard FL metrics
with marketplace-centric dimensions such as Economic Efficiency, Fairness, and
Selection Dynamics; (3) an in-depth empirical analysis of the existing
Distributed Gradient Marketplace framework, MartFL, including the integration
and comparative evaluation of adapted FLTrust and SkyMask as alternative
aggregation strategies within it. This benchmark spans diverse datasets, local
attacks, and Sybil attacks targeting the marketplace selection process; and (4)
actionable insights into the trade-offs between model performance, robustness,
cost, fairness, and stability.
  This benchmark equips the community with essential tools and empirical
evidence to evaluate and design more robust, equitable, and economically viable
decentralized gradient marketplaces.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MCIGLE是一个无需样本的多模态图数据类增量学习框架，通过多通道处理和递归最小二乘法解决灾难性遗忘等问题，在公开数据集上验证有效


<details>

Motivation: 随着多模态图结构数据的普及，现有方法面临灾难性遗忘、分布偏差、内存限制和泛化能力弱等挑战，需要新的解决方案

Method: 提出MCIGLE框架，通过提取和对齐多模态图特征，应用串联递归最小二乘法进行知识保留，采用多通道处理平衡准确性和内存保护

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验验证了该方法的有效性和泛化能力

Conclusion: MCIGLE框架成功解决了多模态图数据类增量学习中的关键问题，为相关领域提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Exemplar-free class-incremental learning enables models to learn new classes
over time without storing data from old ones. As multimodal graph-structured
data becomes increasingly prevalent, existing methods struggle with challenges
like catastrophic forgetting, distribution bias, memory limits, and weak
generalization. We propose MCIGLE, a novel framework that addresses these
issues by extracting and aligning multimodal graph features and applying
Concatenated Recursive Least Squares for effective knowledge retention. Through
multi-channel processing, MCIGLE balances accuracy and memory preservation.
Experiments on public datasets validate its effectiveness and generalizability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了memTrace框架，通过分析LLM内部表示（隐藏状态和注意力模式）而非仅输出，来检测训练数据成员身份，在MIA基准测试中达到0.85的平均AUC分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明基于输出的成员推理攻击对大型语言模型效果有限，但作者认为通过分析模型内部表示可能发现传统方法无法捕捉的记忆痕迹。

Method: memTrace框架分析transformer隐藏状态和注意力模式，包括层级表示动态、注意力分布特征和跨层转换模式，追踪"神经面包屑"来检测记忆指纹。

Result: 在多个模型家族上实现了强大的成员检测能力，在流行的MIA基准测试中平均AUC分数达到0.85，显著优于随机猜测。

Conclusion: 即使输出信号看似受到保护，模型内部行为仍可能暴露训练数据信息，需要进一步研究成员隐私和开发更强大的隐私保护训练技术。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) reveal whether specific data was used to
train machine learning models, serving as important tools for privacy auditing
and compliance assessment. Recent studies have reported that MIAs perform only
marginally better than random guessing against large language models,
suggesting that modern pre-training approaches with massive datasets may be
free from privacy leakage risks. Our work offers a complementary perspective to
these findings by exploring how examining LLMs' internal representations,
rather than just their outputs, may provide additional insights into potential
membership inference signals. Our framework, \emph{memTrace}, follows what we
call \enquote{neural breadcrumbs} extracting informative signals from
transformer hidden states and attention patterns as they process candidate
sequences. By analyzing layer-wise representation dynamics, attention
distribution characteristics, and cross-layer transition patterns, we detect
potential memorization fingerprints that traditional loss-based approaches may
not capture. This approach yields strong membership detection across several
model families achieving average AUC scores of 0.85 on popular MIA benchmarks.
Our findings suggest that internal model behaviors can reveal aspects of
training data exposure even when output-based signals appear protected,
highlighting the need for further research into membership privacy and the
development of more robust privacy-preserving training techniques for large
language models.

TL;DR: Spotify提出基于上下文多臂老虎机的校准方法，动态学习用户在不同情境下的最优内容类型分布，解决历史数据偏向音乐内容的问题，提升用户参与度和非音乐内容的曝光。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spotify首页内容类型多样但历史数据严重偏向音乐，难以实现平衡的个性化内容推荐。用户对不同内容类型的偏好会随情境（时间、设备等）变化，需要动态调整策略。

Method: 使用上下文多臂老虎机方法，基于用户情境和偏好动态学习最优内容类型分布，替代依赖历史平均值的传统校准方法。

Result: 离线和在线实验结果均显示，该方法提高了推荐精度和用户参与度，特别是对播客等代表性不足的内容类型效果显著。

Conclusion: 基于上下文多臂老虎机的校准方法能有效适应不同情境下用户兴趣变化，实现更平衡和个性化的内容推荐，提升整体用户体验。

Abstract: Spotify's Home page features a variety of content types, including music,
podcasts, and audiobooks. However, historical data is heavily skewed toward
music, making it challenging to deliver a balanced and personalized content
mix. Moreover, users' preference towards different content types may vary
depending on the time of day, the day of week, or even the device they use. We
propose a calibration method that leverages contextual bandits to dynamically
learn each user's optimal content type distribution based on their context and
preferences. Unlike traditional calibration methods that rely on historical
averages, our approach boosts engagement by adapting to how users interests in
different content types varies across contexts. Both offline and online results
demonstrate improved precision and user engagement with the Spotify Home page,
in particular with under-represented content types such as podcasts.

*Jia Wang,Xiao Wang,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PLanTS是一个周期性感知的自监督学习框架，通过多粒度分块机制和对比损失来建模多元时间序列的潜在状态和转换，在多个下游任务中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多元时间序列具有高维度、标注数据有限和非平稳性等挑战，现有自监督学习方法忽略了内在周期性结构，无法捕捉潜在状态的动态演化。

Method: 设计了周期感知的多粒度分块机制和广义对比损失，保持实例级和状态级相似性；设计了下一状态转换预测任务来编码未来状态演化的预测信息。

Result: 在多元分类、多标签分类、预测、轨迹跟踪和异常检测等任务中，PLanTS持续提升表示质量，并在运行效率上优于基于DTW的方法。

Conclusion: PLanTS通过显式建模周期性结构和状态转换，有效解决了多元时间序列表示学习的挑战，为相关领域提供了有效的自监督学习解决方案。

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) are ubiquitous in domains such as healthcare,
climate science, and industrial monitoring, but their high dimensionality,
limited labeled data, and non-stationary nature pose significant challenges for
conventional machine learning methods. While recent self-supervised learning
(SSL) approaches mitigate label scarcity by data augmentations or time
point-based contrastive strategy, they neglect the intrinsic periodic structure
of MTS and fail to capture the dynamic evolution of latent states. We propose
PLanTS, a periodicity-aware self-supervised learning framework that explicitly
models irregular latent states and their transitions. We first designed a
period-aware multi-granularity patching mechanism and a generalized contrastive
loss to preserve both instance-level and state-level similarities across
multiple temporal resolutions. To further capture temporal dynamics, we design
a next-transition prediction pretext task that encourages representations to
encode predictive information about future state evolution. We evaluate PLanTS
across a wide range of downstream tasks-including multi-class and multi-label
classification, forecasting, trajectory tracking and anomaly detection. PLanTS
consistently improves the representation quality over existing SSL methods and
demonstrates superior runtime efficiency compared to DTW-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物分子神经网络具有通用函数逼近能力，但由于缺乏目标数据，训练仍然困难。需要一种方法来定义训练目标

Result: 数值实验表明，基于STL的学习方法能够高效解决所研究的回归和控制任务，包括作为失调状态报告器和慢性疾病模型的反馈控制

Conclusion: STL规范为BNNs提供了有效的训练框架，使其能够在生物系统中执行复杂的回归和控制功能，特别是在医疗应用方面具有潜力

Abstract: Biomolecular Neural Networks (BNNs), artificial neural networks with
biologically synthesizable architectures, achieve universal function
approximation capabilities beyond simple biological circuits. However, training
BNNs remains challenging due to the lack of target data. To address this, we
propose leveraging Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications to define
training objectives for BNNs. We build on the quantitative semantics of STL,
enabling gradient-based optimization of the BNN weights, and introduce a
learning algorithm that enables BNNs to perform regression and control tasks in
biological systems. Specifically, we investigate two regression problems in
which we train BNNs to act as reporters of dysregulated states, and a feedback
control problem in which we train the BNN in closed-loop with a chronic disease
model, learning to reduce inflammation while avoiding adverse responses to
external infections. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that STL-based
learning can solve the investigated regression and control tasks efficiently.

Conclusion: 该方法不依赖于特定模型结构，具有良好的通用性，在计算机视觉和自然语言处理等预测可靠性关键的领域都有应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of training data distribution on the
performance of image classification models. By analyzing the embeddings of the
training set, we propose a framework to understand the confidence of model
predictions on unseen data without the need for retraining. Our approach
filters out low-confidence predictions based on their distance from the
training distribution in the embedding space, significantly improving
classification accuracy. We demonstrate this on the example of several
classification models, showing consistent performance gains across
architectures. Furthermore, we show that using multiple embedding models to
represent the training data enables a more robust estimation of confidence, as
different embeddings capture complementary aspects of the data. Combining these
embeddings allows for better detection and exclusion of out-of-distribution
samples, resulting in further accuracy improvements. The proposed method is
model-agnostic and generalizable, with potential applications beyond computer
vision, including domains such as Natural Language Processing where prediction
reliability is critical.

TL;DR: MambaLite-Micro是首个在资源受限微控制器上部署Mamba模型的C语言推理引擎，通过权重轻量化、算子融合和内存优化，减少83%峰值内存，保持高精度和100%分类一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于微控制器内存有限、缺乏原生算子支持和嵌入式友好工具链，Mamba模型在MCU上的部署面临挑战，需要开发专门的轻量级推理解决方案。

Method: 1) 将PyTorch Mamba模型权重导出为轻量格式；2) 用C语言手工实现Mamba层和支持算子，采用算子融合和内存布局优化；3) 消除大型中间张量。

Result: 峰值内存减少83.0%，平均数值误差仅为1.7x10-5，在关键词检测和人类活动识别任务中与PyTorch基线保持100%一致性和分类准确率，在ESP32S3和STM32H7上验证了可移植性。

Conclusion: MambaLite-Micro成功将先进的序列模型Mamba部署到资源受限的嵌入式平台，为实际应用铺平了道路，展示了跨异构嵌入式平台的一致运行能力。

Abstract: Deploying Mamba models on microcontrollers (MCUs) remains challenging due to
limited memory, the lack of native operator support, and the absence of
embedded-friendly toolchains. We present, to our knowledge, the first
deployment of a Mamba-based neural architecture on a resource-constrained MCU,
a fully C-based runtime-free inference engine: MambaLite-Micro. Our pipeline
maps a trained PyTorch Mamba model to on-device execution by (1) exporting
model weights into a lightweight format, and (2) implementing a handcrafted
Mamba layer and supporting operators in C with operator fusion and memory
layout optimization. MambaLite-Micro eliminates large intermediate tensors,
reducing 83.0% peak memory, while maintaining an average numerical error of
only 1.7x10-5 relative to the PyTorch Mamba implementation. When evaluated on
keyword spotting(KWS) and human activity recognition (HAR) tasks,
MambaLite-Micro achieved 100% consistency with the PyTorch baselines, fully
preserving classification accuracy. We further validated portability by
deploying on both ESP32S3 and STM32H7 microcontrollers, demonstrating
consistent operation across heterogeneous embedded platforms and paving the way
for bringing advanced sequence models like Mamba to real-world
resource-constrained applications.

*Peixuan Han,Adit Krishnan,Gerald Friedland,Jiaxuan You,Chris Kong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAR（自对齐奖励）是一种新的奖励信号，通过相对困惑度差异来衡量回答质量，既能提高推理准确性（+4%），又能降低推理成本（-30%），在正确性和效率之间实现了帕累托最优平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的可验证奖励信号过于粗糙（只有二元正确性反馈），导致推理过程冗长、计算成本高，且现有解决方案往往牺牲准确性。需要一种细粒度的奖励信号来同时提升推理准确性和效率。

Method: 提出自对齐奖励（SAR），定义为基于查询的条件答案与独立答案之间的相对困惑度差异。这种信号偏好简洁且针对特定查询的回答，能够可靠地区分回答质量。

Result: 在4个模型和7个基准测试上的评估显示：SAR与PPO、GRPO等RL算法结合使用，准确率提高4%，推理成本降低30%。SAR实现了正确性和效率的帕累托最优权衡，能够在保持高级推理行为的同时缩短回答长度。

Conclusion: SAR作为可验证奖励的细粒度补充，为更高效有效的LLM训练铺平了道路，能够抑制不必要的详细阐述而不丢失关键推理内容。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards has significantly advanced
reasoning in large language models (LLMs), but such signals remain coarse,
offering only binary correctness feedback. This limitation often results in
inefficiencies, including overly verbose reasoning and high computational cost,
while existing solutions often compromise accuracy. To address this, we
introduce self-aligned reward (SAR), a self-guided signal that complements
verifiable rewards to encourage both reasoning accuracy and efficiency. SAR is
defined as the relative perplexity difference between an answer conditioned on
the query and the standalone answer, thereby favoring responses that are
concise and query-specific. Quantitative analysis reveals that SAR reliably
distinguishes answer quality: concise, correct answers score higher than
redundant ones, and partially correct answers score higher than entirely
incorrect ones. Evaluation on 4 models across 7 benchmarks shows that
integrating SAR with prevalent RL algorithms like PPO and GRPO improves
accuracy by 4%, while reducing inference cost by 30%. Further analysis
demonstrates that SAR achieves a Pareto-optimal trade-off between correctness
and efficiency compared to reward signals based on length or self-confidence.
We also show that SAR shortens responses while preserving advanced reasoning
behaviors, demonstrating its ability to suppress unnecessary elaboration
without losing critical reasoning. These results highlight the promise of
self-aligned reward as a fine-grained complement to verifiable rewards, paving
the way for more efficient and effective LLM training.

Motivation: 传统分层强化学习在自动发现任务层次结构和多级策略联合训练时存在不稳定性和缺乏理论保证的问题，需要一种更原则性和可扩展的框架。

Method: RLA框架包含两个协同模型：目标条件的低层策略学习到达指定子目标；高层预期模型作为规划器提出最优路径上的中间子目标，并通过价值几何一致性原则进行训练。

Result: RLA在各种条件下能够逼近全局最优策略，为长时程目标条件任务中的分层规划和执行提供了原则性和收敛性的方法。

Conclusion: RLA提供了一个理论上有保证的、可扩展的分层强化学习框架，有效解决了长时程目标条件任务中的规划和学习问题。

Abstract: Solving long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks remains a significant challenge
in reinforcement learning (RL). Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL)
addresses this by decomposing tasks into more manageable sub-tasks, but the
automatic discovery of the hierarchy and the joint training of multi-level
policies often suffer from instability and can lack theoretical guarantees. In
this paper, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Anticipation (RLA), a
principled and potentially scalable framework designed to address these
limitations. The RLA agent learns two synergistic models: a low-level,
goal-conditioned policy that learns to reach specified subgoals, and a
high-level anticipation model that functions as a planner, proposing
intermediate subgoals on the optimal path to a final goal. The key feature of
RLA is the training of the anticipation model, which is guided by a principle
of value geometric consistency, regularized to prevent degenerate solutions. We
present proofs that RLA approaches the globally optimal policy under various
conditions, establishing a principled and convergent method for hierarchical
planning and execution in long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks.

TL;DR: ProfilingAgent是一个基于LLM的多智能体系统，通过分析静态指标和动态性能信号，自动化地进行结构化剪枝和后训练动态量化，实现模型压缩优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型面临计算和内存瓶颈，传统压缩技术使用统一启发式方法，忽略了架构和运行时异质性，需要更智能的自动化压缩方案。

Method: 使用大型语言模型构建模块化多智能体系统，分析MACs、参数量等静态指标和延迟、内存等动态信号，设计特定架构的剪枝和量化策略。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K等数据集上，剪枝保持竞争力或提升准确率（ImageNet-1K下降约1%，ViT-B/16在小数据集上提升2%），量化实现最高74%内存节省和<0.5%准确率损失，推理速度提升1.74倍。

Conclusion: 智能体系统可作为可扩展的配置文件引导模型优化解决方案，LLM推理质量对迭代剪枝至关重要。

Abstract: Foundation models face growing compute and memory bottlenecks, hindering
deployment on resource-limited platforms. While compression techniques such as
pruning and quantization are widely used, most rely on uniform heuristics that
ignore architectural and runtime heterogeneity. Profiling tools expose
per-layer latency, memory, and compute cost, yet are rarely integrated into
automated pipelines. We propose ProfilingAgent, a profiling-guided, agentic
approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to automate compression via
structured pruning and post-training dynamic quantization. Our modular
multi-agent system reasons over static metrics (MACs, parameter counts) and
dynamic signals (latency, memory) to design architecture-specific strategies.
Unlike heuristic baselines, ProfilingAgent tailors layer-wise decisions to
bottlenecks. Experiments on ImageNet-1K, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 with
ResNet-101, ViT-B/16, Swin-B, and DeiT-B/16 show pruning maintains competitive
or improved accuracy (about 1% drop on ImageNet-1K, +2% gains for ViT-B/16 on
smaller datasets), while quantization achieves up to 74% memory savings with
<0.5% accuracy loss. Our quantization also yields consistent inference speedups
of up to 1.74 times faster. Comparative studies with GPT-4o and GPT-4-Turbo
highlight the importance of LLM reasoning quality for iterative pruning. These
results establish agentic systems as scalable solutions for profiling-guided
model optimization.

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架能够有效处理医学多模态学习中的偏差问题，为现有直接预测方法提供了因果层面的改进

Abstract: Medical multimodal representation learning aims to integrate heterogeneous
clinical data into unified patient representations to support predictive
modeling, which remains an essential yet challenging task in the medical data
mining community. However, real-world medical datasets often suffer from
missing modalities due to cost, protocol, or patient-specific constraints.
Existing methods primarily address this issue by learning from the available
observations in either the raw data space or feature space, but typically
neglect the underlying bias introduced by the data acquisition process itself.
In this work, we identify two types of biases that hinder model generalization:
missingness bias, which results from non-random patterns in modality
availability, and distribution bias, which arises from latent confounders that
influence both observed features and outcomes. To address these challenges, we
perform a structural causal analysis of the data-generating process and propose
a unified framework that is compatible with existing direct prediction-based
multimodal learning methods. Our method consists of two key components: (1) a
missingness deconfounding module that approximates causal intervention based on
backdoor adjustment and (2) a dual-branch neural network that explicitly
disentangles causal features from spurious correlations. We evaluated our
method in real-world public and in-hospital datasets, demonstrating its
effectiveness and causal insights.

Conclusion: OptiProxy-NAS提供了一个有效的端到端优化框架，能够显著提高神经架构搜索的效率和性能，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) is a hard computationally expensive
optimization problem with a discrete, vast, and spiky search space. One of the
key research efforts dedicated to this space focuses on accelerating NAS via
certain proxy evaluations of neural architectures. Different from the prevalent
predictor-based methods using surrogate models and differentiable architecture
search via supernetworks, we propose an optimization proxy to streamline the
NAS as an end-to-end optimization framework, named OptiProxy-NAS. In
particular, using a proxy representation, the NAS space is reformulated to be
continuous, differentiable, and smooth. Thereby, any differentiable
optimization method can be applied to the gradient-based search of the relaxed
architecture parameters. Our comprehensive experiments on $12$ NAS tasks of $4$
search spaces across three different domains including computer vision, natural

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决设备端实时数据分布变化对轻量级模型泛化能力的挑战，避免传统数据密集型和计算昂贵的微调方法

Method: 使用基于原型的参数编辑框架，云端神经适配器生成参数编辑矩阵，动态聚类为原型模型，结合跨层知识传递实现多层参数一致性调整

Result: 在多个数据集上的视觉任务和推荐任务实验证实了方法的有效性和通用性

Conclusion: Persona提供了一种无需部署后重新训练的高效个性化方法，能够有效应对设备端实时数据分布变化问题

Abstract: The on-device real-time data distribution shift on devices challenges the
generalization of lightweight on-device models. This critical issue is often
overlooked in current research, which predominantly relies on data-intensive
and computationally expensive fine-tuning approaches. To tackle this, we
introduce Persona, a novel personalized method using a prototype-based,
backpropagation-free parameter editing framework to enhance model
generalization without post-deployment retraining. Persona employs a neural
adapter in the cloud to generate a parameter editing matrix based on real-time
device data. This matrix adeptly adapts on-device models to the prevailing data
distributions, efficiently clustering them into prototype models. The
prototypes are dynamically refined via the parameter editing matrix,
facilitating efficient evolution. Furthermore, the integration of cross-layer
knowledge transfer ensures consistent and context-aware multi-layer parameter
changes and prototype assignment. Extensive experiments on vision task and
recommendation task on multiple datasets confirm Persona's effectiveness and
generality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于主动学习的无监督时间序列异常检测方法，通过DQS查询策略选择多样化样本进行标签查询，优化阈值选择，在小样本预算下表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督时间序列异常检测方法存在阈值设置不佳的问题，而一些声称无监督的方法仍需使用标注数据进行校准，这在现实世界中往往不可得。

Method: 将主动学习集成到现有无监督异常检测方法中，提出基于动态时间规整的DQS查询策略，通过评估异常分数相似性来最大化查询样本的多样性。

Result: DQS在小预算场景下表现最佳，但其他策略在面对错误标注时更稳健。所有查询策略即使在存在错误标注的情况下也优于无监督阈值。

Conclusion: 在实际应用中，查询策略的选择取决于标注专家的专业水平和愿意标注的样本数量。只要可能查询专家，推荐使用基于主动学习的阈值方法。

Abstract: Truly unsupervised approaches for time series anomaly detection are rare in
the literature. Those that exist suffer from a poorly set threshold, which
hampers detection performance, while others, despite claiming to be
unsupervised, need to be calibrated using a labelled data subset, which is
often not available in the real world. This work integrates active learning
with an existing unsupervised anomaly detection method by selectively querying
the labels of multivariate time series, which are then used to refine the
threshold selection process. To achieve this, we introduce a novel query
strategy called the dissimilarity-based query strategy (DQS). DQS aims to
maximise the diversity of queried samples by evaluating the similarity between
anomaly scores using dynamic time warping. We assess the detection performance
of DQS in comparison to other query strategies and explore the impact of
mislabelling, a topic that is underexplored in the literature. Our findings
indicate that DQS performs best in small-budget scenarios, though the others
appear to be more robust when faced with mislabelling. Therefore, in the real
world, the choice of query strategy depends on the expertise of the oracle and
the number of samples they are willing to label. Regardless, all query
strategies outperform the unsupervised threshold even in the presence of
mislabelling. Thus, whenever it is feasible to query an oracle, employing an
active learning-based threshold is recommended.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using multimodal sensor data remains
challenging due to noisy or incomplete measurements, scarcity of labeled
examples, and privacy concerns. Traditional centralized deep learning
approaches are often constrained by infrastructure availability, network
latency, and data sharing restrictions. While federated learning (FL) addresses
privacy by training models locally and sharing only model parameters, it still
has to tackle issues arising from the use of heterogeneous multimodal data and
differential privacy requirements. In this article, a Graph-based Multimodal
Federated Learning framework, GraMFedDHAR, is proposed for HAR tasks. Diverse
sensor streams such as a pressure mat, depth camera, and multiple
accelerometers are modeled as modality-specific graphs, processed through
residual Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs), and fused via
attention-based weighting rather than simple concatenation. The fused
embeddings enable robust activity classification, while differential privacy
safeguards data during federated aggregation. Experimental results show that
the proposed MultiModalGCN model outperforms the baseline MultiModalFFN, with
up to 2 percent higher accuracy in non-DP settings in both centralized and
federated paradigms. More importantly, significant improvements are observed
under differential privacy constraints: MultiModalGCN consistently surpasses
MultiModalFFN, with performance gaps ranging from 7 to 13 percent depending on
the privacy budget and setting. These results highlight the robustness of
graph-based modeling in multimodal learning, where GNNs prove more resilient to
the performance degradation introduced by DP noise.

Conclusion: 提出的分布式训练方法通过并行化技术有效解决了深度神经网络训练效率低的问题，为大规模深度学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the notable success of deep neural networks (DNNs) in solving complex
tasks, the training process still remains considerable challenges. A primary
obstacle is the substantial time required for training, particularly as high
performing DNNs tend to become increasingly deep (characterized by a larger
number of hidden layers) and require extensive training datasets. To address
these challenges, this paper introduces a distributed training method that
integrates two prominent strategies for accelerating deep learning: data
parallelism and fully decoupled parallel backpropagation algorithm. By
utilizing multiple computational units operating in parallel, the proposed
approach enhances the amount of training data processed in each iteration while
mitigating locking issues commonly associated with the backpropagation
algorithm. These features collectively contribute to significant improvements
in training efficiency. The proposed distributed training method is rigorously
proven to converge to critical points under certain conditions. Its
effectiveness is further demonstrated through empirical evaluations, wherein an
DNN is trained to perform classification tasks on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Motivation: 形态感知器中的形态算子具有不可微分性，使得基于梯度的优化方法无法用于训练此类网络，需要寻找不依赖梯度信息的替代策略

Method: 将训练问题表述为凸差(DC)函数，使用凸凹过程(CCP)迭代求解，产生一系列线性规划子问题

Result: 计算实验证明了所提出的训练方法在处理MPCL网络分类任务方面的有效性

Conclusion: CCP方法为训练不可微分的形态感知器网络提供了一种有效的替代方案，能够成功解决多类分类任务

Abstract: A morphological perceptron is a multilayer feedforward neural network in
which neurons perform elementary operations from mathematical morphology. For
multiclass classification tasks, a morphological perceptron with a competitive
layer (MPCL) is obtained by integrating a winner-take-all output layer into the
standard morphological architecture. The non-differentiability of morphological
operators renders gradient-based optimization methods unsuitable for training
such networks. Consequently, alternative strategies that do not depend on
gradient information are commonly adopted. This paper proposes the use of the
convex-concave procedure (CCP) for training MPCL networks. The training problem
is formulated as a difference of convex (DC) functions and solved iteratively
using CCP, resulting in a sequence of linear programming subproblems.
Computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
training method in addressing classification tasks with MPCL networks.

Abstract: How do we enable AI systems to efficiently learn in the real-world?
First-principles models are widely used to simulate natural systems, but often
fail to capture real-world complexity due to simplifying assumptions. In
contrast, deep learning approaches can estimate complex dynamics with minimal
assumptions but require large, representative datasets. We propose SimPEL, a
method that efficiently combines first-principles models with data-driven
learning by using low-fidelity simulators as priors in Bayesian deep learning.
This enables SimPEL to benefit from simulator knowledge in low-data regimes and
leverage deep learning's flexibility when more data is available, all the while
carefully quantifying epistemic uncertainty. We evaluate SimPEL on diverse
systems, including biological, agricultural, and robotic domains, showing
superior performance in learning complex dynamics. For decision-making, we
demonstrate that SimPEL bridges the sim-to-real gap in model-based
reinforcement learning. On a high-speed RC car task, SimPEL learns a highly
dynamic parking maneuver involving drifting with substantially less data than
state-of-the-art baselines. These results highlight the potential of SimPEL for
data-efficient learning and control in complex real-world environments.

Conclusion: 建议在收集大规模数据集时混入探索数据，而不仅仅依赖专家数据，以提升离线训练的性能和演化能力。

Abstract: Data collection is crucial for learning robust world models in model-based
reinforcement learning. The most prevalent strategies are to actively collect
trajectories by interacting with the environment during online training or
training on offline datasets. At first glance, the nature of learning
task-agnostic environment dynamics makes world models a good candidate for
effective offline training. However, the effects of online vs. offline data on
world models and thus on the resulting task performance have not been
thoroughly studied in the literature. In this work, we investigate both
paradigms in model-based settings, conducting experiments on 31 different
environments. First, we showcase that online agents outperform their offline
counterparts. We identify a key challenge behind performance degradation of
offline agents: encountering Out-Of-Distribution states at test time. This
issue arises because, without the self-correction mechanism in online agents,
offline datasets with limited state space coverage induce a mismatch between
the agent's imagination and real rollouts, compromising policy training. We
demonstrate that this issue can be mitigated by allowing for additional online
interactions in a fixed or adaptive schedule, restoring the performance of
online training with limited interaction data. We also showcase that
incorporating exploration data helps mitigate the performance degradation of
offline agents. Based on our insights, we recommend adding exploration data
when collecting large datasets, as current efforts predominantly focus on
expert data alone.

Abstract: Anomaly detection underpins critical applications from network security and
intrusion detection to fraud prevention, where recognizing aberrant patterns
rapidly is indispensable. Progress in this area is routinely impeded by two
obstacles: extreme class imbalance and the curse of dimensionality. To combat
the former, we previously introduced Precision-Recall Curve (PRC)
classification trees and their ensemble extension, the PRC Random Forest
(PRC-RF). Building on that foundation, we now propose a hybrid framework that
integrates PRC-RF with autoencoders, unsupervised machine learning methods that
learn compact latent representations, to confront both challenges
simultaneously. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the resulting Autoencoder-PRC-RF model achieves superior
accuracy, scalability, and interpretability relative to prior methods,
affirming its potential for high-stakes anomaly-detection tasks.

Motivation: 现有的分布外(OOD)检测方法需要更可靠的评估方法来确保其在多样化条件下的性能表现，以提高人工智能系统的稳健性。

Method: 提出双重交叉验证框架，分别采用不同方式处理分布内(ID)和分布外(OOD)数据：ID数据采用标准分割方法，OOD数据按类别分组。在类别层次结构下，考虑整个类别层次来获得公平的ID-OOD分割。

Result: 对比多个独立的状态最优OOD检测方法，结果显示该方法能够快速收敛到真实性能值。

Conclusion: DCV-ROOD框架为OOD检测模型提供了一种可靠的评估方法，能够更准确地估计模型在实际应用中的性能表现。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection plays a key role in enhancing the
robustness of artificial intelligence systems by identifying inputs that differ
significantly from the training distribution, thereby preventing unreliable
predictions and enabling appropriate fallback mechanisms. Developing reliable
OOD detection methods is a significant challenge, and rigorous evaluation of
these techniques is essential for ensuring their effectiveness, as it allows
researchers to assess their performance under diverse conditions and to
identify potential limitations or failure modes. Cross-validation (CV) has
proven to be a highly effective tool for providing a reasonable estimate of the
performance of a learning algorithm. Although OOD scenarios exhibit particular
characteristics, an appropriate adaptation of CV can lead to a suitable
evaluation framework for this setting. This work proposes a dual CV framework
for robust evaluation of OOD detection models, aimed at improving the
reliability of their assessment. The proposed evaluation framework aims to
effectively integrate in-distribution (ID) and OOD data while accounting for
their differing characteristics. To achieve this, ID data are partitioned using
a conventional approach, whereas OOD data are divided by grouping samples based
on their classes. Furthermore, we analyze the context of data with class
hierarchy to propose a data splitting that considers the entire class hierarchy
to obtain fair ID-OOD partitions to apply the proposed evaluation framework.
This framework is called Dual Cross-Validation for Robust Out-of-Distribution
Detection (DCV-ROOD). To test the validity of the evaluation framework, we
selected a set of state-of-the-art OOD detection methods, both with and without
outlier exposure. The results show that the method achieves very fast
convergence to the true performance.

Conclusion: ExoST框架成功解决了外生变量建模中的选择和平衡问题，为时空预测提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Spatio-temporal forecasting aims to predict the future state of dynamic
systems and plays an important role in multiple fields. However, existing
solutions only focus on modeling using a limited number of observed target
variables. In real-world scenarios, exogenous variables can be integrated into
the model as additional input features and associated with the target signal to
promote forecast accuracy. Although promising, this still encounters two
challenges: the inconsistent effects of different exogenous variables to the
target system, and the imbalance effects between historical variables and
future variables. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \model, a
novel framework for modeling \underline{exo}genous variables in
\underline{s}patio-\underline{t}emporal forecasting, which follows a ``select,
then balance'' paradigm. Specifically, we first construct a latent space gated
expert module, where fused exogenous information is projected into a latent
space to dynamically select and recompose salient signals via specialized
sub-experts. Furthermore, we design a siamese network architecture in which
recomposed representations of past and future exogenous variables are fed into
dual-branch spatio-temporal backbones to capture dynamic patterns. The outputs
are integrated through a context-aware weighting mechanism to achieve dynamic
balance during the modeling process. Extensive experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, generality, robustness, and efficiency
of our proposed framework.

Motivation: 探索Transformer基础模型是否真正内部化了语义概念（如市场治理），以及是否能利用其内部表征来模拟稀罕但高风险的市场崩盘事件。

Method: 使用激活移植技术，通过将某个事件（如历史崩盘）的统计矩征强制注入到另一个事件（如平静期）的隐藏状态中，实现因果干预操控预测结果。

Result: 注入崩盘语义会导致下跌预测，注入平静语义则能压制崩盘并恢复稳定性。模型还编码了事件严重程度的等级概念，潜在向量模长与系统性震荡大小直接相关。

Conclusion: 大型时间序列Transformer模型具有可操控、语义基础的表征能力，为语义级别的"假如"分析和战略压力测试提供了新方法。

Abstract: While transformer-based foundation models excel at forecasting routine
patterns, two questions remain: do they internalize semantic concepts such as
market regimes, or merely fit curves? And can their internal representations be
leveraged to simulate rare, high-stakes events such as market crashes? To
investigate this, we introduce activation transplantation, a causal
intervention that manipulates hidden states by imposing the statistical moments
of one event (e.g., a historical crash) onto another (e.g., a calm period)
during the forward pass. This procedure deterministically steers forecasts:
injecting crash semantics induces downturn predictions, while injecting calm
semantics suppresses crashes and restores stability. Beyond binary control, we
find that models encode a graded notion of event severity, with the latent
vector norm directly correlating with the magnitude of systemic shocks.
Validated across two architecturally distinct TSFMs, Toto (decoder only) and
Chronos (encoder-decoder), our results demonstrate that steerable, semantically
grounded representations are a robust property of large time series
transformers. Our findings provide evidence for a latent concept space that
governs model predictions, shifting interpretability from post-hoc attribution
to direct causal intervention, and enabling semantic "what-if" analysis for
strategic stress-testing.

Conclusion: 在更现实的假设条件下成功扩展了AMOO框架，为深度学习中的多目标优化提供了更实用的理论基础和算法保证。

Abstract: It is widely recognized in modern machine learning practice that access to a
diverse set of tasks can enhance performance across those tasks. This
observation suggests that, unlike in general multi-objective optimization, the
objectives in many real-world settings may not be inherently conflicting. To
address this, prior work introduced the Aligned Multi-Objective Optimization
(AMOO) framework and proposed gradient-based algorithms with provable
convergence guarantees. However, existing analysis relies on strong
assumptions, particularly strong convexity, which implies the existence of a
unique optimal solution. In this work, we relax this assumption and study
gradient-descent algorithms for convex AMOO under standard smoothness or
Lipschitz continuity conditions-assumptions more consistent with those used in
deep learning practice. This generalization requires new analytical tools and
metrics to characterize convergence in the convex AMOO setting. We develop such
tools, propose scalable algorithms for convex AMOO, and establish their
convergence guarantees. Additionally, we prove a novel lower bound that
demonstrates the suboptimality of naive equal-weight approaches compared to our
methods.

Conclusion: 研究结果强调需要批判性地重新评估使用共形预测器生成的预测集。虽然它们可以提供更高的真实类别覆盖率，但在捕捉偶然不确定性方面的能力有限，需要进一步改进

Abstract: Conformal prediction is a model-agnostic approach to generating prediction
sets that cover the true class with a high probability. Although its prediction
set size is expected to capture aleatoric uncertainty, there is a lack of
evidence regarding its effectiveness. The literature presents that prediction
set size can upper-bound aleatoric uncertainty or that prediction sets are
larger for difficult instances and smaller for easy ones, but a validation of
this attribute of conformal predictors is missing. This work investigates how
effectively conformal predictors quantify aleatoric uncertainty, specifically
the inherent ambiguity in datasets caused by overlapping classes. We perform
this by measuring the correlation between prediction set sizes and the number
of distinct labels assigned by human annotators per instance. We further assess
the similarity between prediction sets and human-provided annotations. We use
three conformal prediction approaches to generate prediction sets for eight
deep learning models trained on four datasets. The datasets contain annotations
from multiple human annotators (ranging from five to fifty participants) per
instance, enabling the identification of class overlap. We show that the vast
majority of the conformal prediction outputs show a very weak to weak
correlation with human annotations, with only a few showing moderate
correlation. These findings underscore the necessity of critically reassessing
the prediction sets generated using conformal predictors. While they can
provide a higher coverage of the true classes, their capability in capturing
aleatoric uncertainty remains limited.

<details>

Motivation: 利用大语言模型模拟社会科学实验结果，通过细调提升模拟的准确性和可靠性

Method: 构建SocSci210数据集（包含210个实验的2.9百万个响应），对Qwen2.5-14B模型进行细调，得到Socrates-Qwen-14B模型

Result: 在未见实验中预测与人类响应分布的对齐度提升26%，超越GPT-4o 13%；在新条件下的泛化能力提升71%；人口学偏见减少10.6%

Conclusion: 细调社会科学实验数据能够显著提升LLM在实验模拟中的准确性，为实验假设预测提供了可靠工具

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer a powerful opportunity to simulate the
results of social science experiments. In this work, we demonstrate that
finetuning LLMs directly on individual-level responses from past experiments
meaningfully improves the accuracy of such simulations across diverse social
science domains. We construct SocSci210 via an automatic pipeline, a dataset
comprising 2.9 million responses from 400,491 participants in 210 open-source
social science experiments. Through finetuning, we achieve multiple levels of
generalization. In completely unseen studies, our strongest model,
Socrates-Qwen-14B, produces predictions that are 26% more aligned with
distributions of human responses to diverse outcome questions under varying
conditions relative to its base model (Qwen2.5-14B), outperforming GPT-4o by
13%. By finetuning on a subset of conditions in a study, generalization to new
unseen conditions is particularly robust, improving by 71%. Since SocSci210
contains rich demographic information, we reduce demographic parity, a measure
of bias, by 10.6% through finetuning. Because social sciences routinely
generate rich, topic-specific datasets, our findings indicate that finetuning
on such data could enable more accurate simulations for experimental hypothesis
screening. We release our data, models and finetuning code at

Abstract: While queueing network models are powerful tools for analyzing service
systems, they traditionally require substantial human effort and domain
expertise to construct. To make this modeling approach more scalable and
accessible, we propose a data-driven framework for queueing network modeling
and simulation based on autoregressive sequence models trained on event-stream
data. Instead of explicitly specifying arrival processes, service mechanisms,
or routing logic, our approach learns the conditional distributions of event
types and event times, recasting the modeling task as a problem of sequence
distribution learning. We show that Transformer-style architectures can
effectively parameterize these distributions, enabling automated construction
of high-fidelity simulators. As a proof of concept, we validate our framework
on event tables generated from diverse queueing networks, showcasing its
utility in simulation, uncertainty quantification, and counterfactual
evaluation. Leveraging advances in artificial intelligence and the growing
availability of data, our framework takes a step toward more automated,
data-driven modeling pipelines to support broader adoption of queueing network
models across service domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了机器学习遗忘中的对抗性伪造问题，证明了在大多数情况下随机采样伪造点的概率极小，为检测虚假遗忘声明提供了理论依据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受隐私法规和消除有害数据影响的需求驱动，机器学习遗忘旨在修改训练模型以有效"忘记"指定数据。验证遗忘的关键挑战是对抗性伪造——恶意制作模仿目标点梯度的数据，造成已遗忘的假象而实际未移除信息。

Method: 提出了ε-伪造集的分析框架，针对线性回归和单层神经网络，证明了该集合的Lebesgue测度很小（按ε或ε^d缩放）。在一般正则性假设下，证明了伪造集测度以ε^{(d-r)/2}衰减，其中d是数据维度，r是模型梯度变化矩阵的零度。扩展到批量SGD和几乎处处光滑损失函数也得到了相同的渐近缩放。

Result: 研究结果表明：1）伪造集的测度随ε减小而快速衰减；2）在非退化数据分布下，随机采样伪造点的概率极小；3）对抗性伪造在根本上受到限制。

Conclusion: 对抗性伪造从根本上受到限制，虚假的遗忘声明原则上可以被检测到。这为机器学习遗忘的可验证性提供了重要的理论保证。

Abstract: Motivated by privacy regulations and the need to mitigate the effects of
harmful data, machine unlearning seeks to modify trained models so that they
effectively ``forget'' designated data. A key challenge in verifying unlearning
is forging -- adversarially crafting data that mimics the gradient of a target
point, thereby creating the appearance of unlearning without actually removing
information. To capture this phenomenon, we consider the collection of data
points whose gradients approximate a target gradient within tolerance
$\epsilon$ -- which we call an $\epsilon$-forging set -- and develop a
framework for its analysis. For linear regression and one-layer neural
networks, we show that the Lebesgue measure of this set is small. It scales on
the order of $\epsilon$, and when $\epsilon$ is small enough, $\epsilon^d$.
More generally, under mild regularity assumptions, we prove that the forging
set measure decays as $\epsilon^{(d-r)/2}$, where $d$ is the data dimension and
$r<d$ is the nullity of a variation matrix defined by the model gradients.
Extensions to batch SGD and almost-everywhere smooth loss functions yield the
same asymptotic scaling. In addition, we establish probability bounds showing
that, under non-degenerate data distributions, the likelihood of randomly
sampling a forging point is vanishingly small. These results provide evidence
that adversarial forging is fundamentally limited and that false unlearning
claims can, in principle, be detected.

Abstract: A surrogate model is developed to predict the convective heat transfer
coefficient of liquid sodium (Na) flow within rectangular miniature heat sinks.
Initially, kernel-based machine learning techniques and shallow neural network
are applied to a dataset with 87 Nusselt numbers for liquid sodium in
rectangular miniature heat sinks. Subsequently, a self-supervised
physics-informed neural network and transfer learning approach are used to
increase the estimation performance. In the self-supervised physics-informed
neural network, an additional layer determines the weight the of physics in the
loss function to balance data and physics based on their uncertainty for a
better estimation. For transfer learning, a shallow neural network trained on
water is adapted for use with Na. Validation results show that the
self-supervised physics-informed neural network successfully estimate the heat
transfer rates of Na with an error margin of approximately +8%. Using only
physics for regression, the error remains between 5% to 10%. Other machine
learning methods specify the prediction mostly within +8%. High-fidelity
modeling of turbulent forced convection of liquid metals using computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) is both time-consuming and computationally expensive.
Therefore, machine learning based models offer a powerful alternative tool for
the design and optimization of liquid-metal-cooled miniature heat sinks.

Motivation: 研究发现现有LLM-based Text-to-SQL方法忽视了数据库模式信息的重要性，而模式信息在生成高质量SQL查询中起着关键甚至主导作用。

Method: 提出包含两个组件的数据库模式专家：1）X-Linking：基于LLM监督微调的Schema Linking方法；2）X-Admin：通过桥接抽象模式信息和用户自然语言问题来实现Schema Understanding。同时采用多LLMs策略提升系统性能。

Result: 在Spider-Dev数据集上达到84.9%的执行准确率，在Spider-Test数据集上达到82.5%的执行准确率，成为基于开源模型的领先Text-to-SQL框架。

Conclusion: 数据库模式信息对Text-to-SQL任务至关重要，X-SQL框架通过创新的模式专家组件和多LLMs策略，显著提升了开源模型在该任务上的性能表现。

Abstract: With Large Language Models' (LLMs) emergent abilities on code generation
tasks, Text-to-SQL has become one of the most popular downstream applications.
Despite the strong results of multiple recent LLM-based Text-to-SQL frameworks,
the research community often overlooks the importance of database schema
information for generating high-quality SQL queries. We find that such schema
information plays a significant or even dominant role in the Text-to-SQL task.
To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel database schema expert with two
components. We first introduce X-Linking, an LLM Supervised Finetuning
(SFT)-based method that achieves superior Schema Linking results compared to
existing open-source Text-to-SQL methods. In addition, we innovatively propose
an X-Admin component that focuses on Schema Understanding by bridging the gap
between abstract schema information and the user's natural language question.
Aside from better learning with schema information, we experiment with
Multi-LLMs for different components within the system to further boost its
performance. By incorporating these techniques into our end-to-end framework,
X-SQL, we have achieved Execution Accuracies of 84.9% on the Spider-Dev dataset
and 82.5% on the Spider-Test dataset. This outstanding performance establishes
X-SQL as the leading Text-to-SQL framework based on open-source models.

Motivation: 解决现实世界中在线决策的不确定性挑战，如AI集群中的工作负载调度需要平衡长期服务协议和突发需求

Method: 首先提出具有竞争性保证的BEST算法，然后引入CoRT学习增强变体，整合不可信的机器学习预测

Result: 理论分析显示CoRT在预测准确时优于BEST，并在任意预测错误下保持鲁棒性；案例研究验证了算法在平衡轨迹跟踪、决策平滑性和抗干扰方面的有效性

Conclusion: SOOTT框架和相应算法为在线决策提供了有效的解决方案，特别适用于需要平衡多种目标的现实应用场景

Abstract: We introduce the Smoothed Online Optimization for Target Tracking (SOOTT)
problem, a new framework that integrates three key objectives in online
decision-making under uncertainty: (1) tracking cost for following a
dynamically moving target, (2) adversarial perturbation cost for withstanding
unpredictable disturbances, and (3) switching cost for penalizing abrupt
changes in decisions. This formulation captures real-world scenarios such as
elastic and inelastic workload scheduling in AI clusters, where operators must
balance long-term service-level agreements (e.g., LLM training) against sudden
demand spikes (e.g., real-time inference). We first present BEST, a robust
algorithm with provable competitive guarantees for SOOTT. To enhance practical
performance, we introduce CoRT, a learning-augmented variant that incorporates
untrusted black-box predictions (e.g., from ML models) into its decision
process. Our theoretical analysis shows that CoRT strictly improves over BEST
when predictions are accurate, while maintaining robustness under arbitrary
prediction errors. We validate our approach through a case study on workload
scheduling, demonstrating that both algorithms effectively balance trajectory
tracking, decision smoothness, and resilience to external disturbances.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于自然语言的基础模型无法理解电信、电商和金融等领域中结构化交互的整体性，将事件序列化为文本会导致语义碎片化和关键上下文丢失。

Method: 采用复合标记化原则，将每个多属性事件视为单个语义连贯单元，学习用户行为的底层"语法"，感知完整的交互而非离散的数据流。

Result: 该架构不仅更准确，而且代表了创建更适应性和智能预测系统的根本性进步。

Conclusion: UIFM模型为真正的行为理解提供了基础，是构建能够理解和预测复杂演化事件序列的AI系统的重要进展。

Abstract: A central goal of artificial intelligence is to build systems that can
understand and predict complex, evolving sequences of events. However, current
foundation models, designed for natural language, fail to grasp the holistic
nature of structured interactions found in domains like telecommunications,
e-commerce and finance. By serializing events into text, they disassemble them
into semantically fragmented parts, losing critical context. In this work, we
introduce the Unified Interaction Foundation Model (UIFM), a foundation model
engineered for genuine behavioral understanding. At its core is the principle
of composite tokenization, where each multi-attribute event is treated as a
single, semantically coherent unit. This allows UIFM to learn the underlying
"grammar" of user behavior, perceiving entire interactions rather than a
disconnected stream of data points. We demonstrate that this architecture is
not just more accurate, but represents a fundamental step towards creating more
adaptable and intelligent predictive systems.

Result: 显著减少对环境交互的依赖，以最小交互成本实现高性能策略

Conclusion: PolicyEvolve提供了一个通用的程序化策略生成框架，能够高效生成可解释的高性能多智能体策略

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has achieved significant progress
in solving complex multi-player games through self-play. However, training
effective adversarial policies requires millions of experience samples and
substantial computational resources. Moreover, these policies lack
interpretability, hindering their practical deployment. Recently, researchers
have successfully leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate
programmatic policies for single-agent tasks, transforming neural network-based
policies into interpretable rule-based code with high execution efficiency.
Inspired by this, we propose PolicyEvolve, a general framework for generating
programmatic policies in multi-player games. PolicyEvolve significantly reduces
reliance on manually crafted policy code, achieving high-performance policies
with minimal environmental interactions. The framework comprises four modules:
Global Pool, Local Pool, Policy Planner, and Trajectory Critic. The Global Pool
preserves elite policies accumulated during iterative training. The Local Pool
stores temporary policies for the current iteration; only sufficiently
high-performing policies from this pool are promoted to the Global Pool. The
Policy Planner serves as the core policy generation module. It samples the top
three policies from the Global Pool, generates an initial policy for the
current iteration based on environmental information, and refines this policy
using feedback from the Trajectory Critic. Refined policies are then deposited
into the Local Pool. This iterative process continues until the policy achieves
a sufficiently high average win rate against the Global Pool, at which point it
is integrated into the Global Pool. The Trajectory Critic analyzes interaction
data from the current policy, identifies vulnerabilities, and proposes
directional improvements to guide the Policy Planner

Conclusion: ARIES是首个建立时间序列数据属性与建模策略关系的研究，同时实现了可解释的模型推荐系统

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning models for time series forecasting have
been significant. These models often leverage fundamental time series
properties such as seasonality and non-stationarity, which may suggest an
intrinsic link between model performance and data properties. However, existing
benchmark datasets fail to offer diverse and well-defined temporal patterns,
restricting the systematic evaluation of such connections. Additionally, there
is no effective model recommendation approach, leading to high time and cost
expenditures when testing different architectures across different downstream
applications. For those reasons, we propose ARIES, a framework for assessing
relation between time series properties and modeling strategies, and for
recommending deep forcasting models for realistic time series. First, we
construct a synthetic dataset with multiple distinct patterns, and design a
comprehensive system to compute the properties of time series. Next, we conduct
an extensive benchmarking of over 50 forecasting models, and establish the
relationship between time series properties and modeling strategies. Our
experimental results reveal a clear correlation. Based on these findings, we
propose the first deep forecasting model recommender, capable of providing
interpretable suggestions for real-world time series. In summary, ARIES is the
first study to establish the relations between the properties of time series
data and modeling strategies, while also implementing a model recommendation
system. The code is available at: https://github.com/blisky-li/ARIES.

Motivation: 有限元方法在处理米级超导磁体时计算成本高、耗时严重，限制了大型REBCO磁体系统的快速设计，需要开发高效的替代计算方法。

Method: 使用全连接残差神经网络(FCRN)构建代理模型，通过有限元模拟生成训练数据集，比较不同网络深度和神经元数量的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的FCRN代理模型在准确性和效率方面都表现出色，为大型高温超导磁体的快速分析提供了有前景的工具。

Abstract: Finite element method (FEM) is widely used in high-temperature
superconducting (HTS) magnets, but its computational cost increases with magnet
size and becomes time-consuming for meter-scale magnets, especially when
multi-physics couplings are considered, which limits the fast design of
large-scale REBCO magnet systems. In this work, a surrogate model based on a
fully connected residual neural network (FCRN) is developed to predict the
space-time current density distribution in REBCO solenoids. Training datasets
were generated from FEM simulations with varying numbers of turns and pancakes.
The results demonstrate that, for deeper networks, the FCRN architecture
achieves better convergence than conventional fully connected network (FCN),
with the configuration of 12 residual blocks and 256 neurons per layer
providing the most favorable balance between training accuracy and
generalization capability. Extrapolation studies show that the model can
reliably predict magnetization losses for up to 50% beyond the training range,
with maximum errors below 10%. The surrogate model achieves predictions several
orders of magnitude faster than FEM and still remains advantageous when
training costs are included. These results indicate that the proposed
FCRN-based surrogate model provides both accuracy and efficiency, offering a
promising tool for the rapid analysis of large-scale HTS magnets.

Abstract: Time-inconsistent preferences, where agents favor smaller-sooner over
larger-later rewards, are a key feature of human and animal decision-making.
Quasi-Hyperbolic (QH) discounting provides a simple yet powerful model for this
behavior, but its integration into the reinforcement learning (RL) framework
has been limited. This paper addresses key theoretical and algorithmic gaps for
precommitted agents with QH preferences. We make two primary contributions: (i)
we formally characterize the structure of the optimal policy, proving for the
first time that it reduces to a simple one-step non-stationary form; and (ii)
we design the first practical, model-free algorithms for both policy evaluation
and Q-learning in this setting, both with provable convergence guarantees. Our
results provide foundational insights for incorporating QH preferences in RL.

Abstract: Beginning with text and images, generative AI has expanded to audio, video,
computer code, and molecules. Yet, if generative AI is the answer, what is the
question? We explore the foundations of generation as a distinct machine
learning task with connections to prediction, compression, and decision-making.
We survey five major generative model families: autoregressive models,
variational autoencoders, normalizing flows, generative adversarial networks,
and diffusion models. We then introduce a probabilistic framework that
emphasizes the distinction between density estimation and generation. We review
a game-theoretic framework with a two-player adversary-learner setup to study
generation. We discuss post-training modifications that prepare generative
models for deployment. We end by highlighting some important topics in socially
responsible generation such as privacy, detection of AI-generated content, and
copyright and IP. We adopt a task-first framing of generation, focusing on what
generation is as a machine learning problem, rather than only on how models
implement it.

Method: 采用Graph Neural Simulators (GNS)－消息传递图神经网框架，结合显式数值时间步进方案，通过建模瞬时时间导数来学习PDE解。评估了三个典型PDE系统，并提出pca+kmeans轨迹选择策略提高低数据性能。

Result: 在仅使用30个训练样本(总数的3%)的情况下，GNS在所有三个PDE系统上均达到了低于1%的相对L2误差。相比于FNO AR和DON AR，GNS分别减少82.48%和99.86%的自回归错误积累。

Conclusion: 结合图基本地归纳偏置与传统时间积分器，可以构建准确、物理一致且可扩展的时间依赖性PDE代模型。

Abstract: Neural operators (NOs) approximate mappings between infinite-dimensional
function spaces but require large datasets and struggle with scarce training
data. Many NO formulations don't explicitly encode causal, local-in-time
structure of physical evolution. While autoregressive models preserve causality
by predicting next time-steps, they suffer from rapid error accumulation. We
employ Graph Neural Simulators (GNS) - a message-passing graph neural network
framework - with explicit numerical time-stepping schemes to construct accurate
forward models that learn PDE solutions by modeling instantaneous time
derivatives. We evaluate our framework on three canonical PDE systems: (1) 2D
Burgers' scalar equation, (2) 2D coupled Burgers' vector equation, and (3) 2D
Allen-Cahn equation. Rigorous evaluations demonstrate GNS significantly
improves data efficiency, achieving higher generalization accuracy with
substantially fewer training trajectories compared to neural operator baselines
like DeepONet and FNO. GNS consistently achieves under 1% relative L2 errors
with only 30 training samples out of 1000 (3% of available data) across all
three PDE systems. It substantially reduces error accumulation over extended
temporal horizons: averaged across all cases, GNS reduces autoregressive error
by 82.48% relative to FNO AR and 99.86% relative to DON AR. We introduce a
PCA+KMeans trajectory selection strategy enhancing low-data performance.
Results indicate combining graph-based local inductive biases with conventional
time integrators yields accurate, physically consistent, and scalable surrogate
models for time-dependent PDEs.

Abstract: The field of human activity recognition has evolved significantly, driven
largely by advancements in Internet of Things (IoT) device technology,
particularly in personal devices. This study investigates the use of
ultra-wideband (UWB) technology for tracking inhabitant paths in home
environments using deep learning models. UWB technology estimates user
locations via time-of-flight and time-difference-of-arrival methods, which are
significantly affected by the presence of walls and obstacles in real
environments, reducing their precision. To address these challenges, we propose
a fingerprinting-based approach utilizing received signal strength indicator
(RSSI) data collected from inhabitants in two flats (60 m2 and 100 m2) while
performing daily activities. We compare the performance of convolutional neural
network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and hybrid CNN+LSTM models, as
well as the use of Bluetooth technology. Additionally, we evaluate the impact
of the type and duration of the temporal window (future, past, or a combination
of both). Our results demonstrate a mean absolute error close to 50 cm,
highlighting the superiority of the hybrid model in providing accurate location
estimates, thus facilitating its application in daily human activity
recognition in residential settings.

Conclusion: 该研究提出的新模板结构和方法能够在精确度损失小的情况下，进一步减小神经网络计算运算器的面积，为边缘设处上的能耗优化提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Deploying neural networks on edge devices entails a careful balance between
the energy required for inference and the accuracy of the resulting
classification. One technique for navigating this tradeoff is approximate
computing: the process of reducing energy consumption by slightly reducing the
accuracy of arithmetic operators. In this context, we propose a methodology to
reduce the area of the small arithmetic operators used in neural networks -
i.e., adders and multipliers - via a small loss in accuracy, and show that we
improve area savings for the same accuracy loss w.r.t. the state of the art. To
achieve our goal, we improve on a boolean rewriting technique recently
proposed, called XPAT, where the use of a parametrisable template to rewrite
circuits has proved to be highly beneficial. In particular, XPAT was able to
produce smaller circuits than comparable approaches while utilising a naive sum
of products template structure. In this work, we show that template parameters
can act as proxies for chosen metrics and we propose a novel template based on
parametrisable product sharing that acts as a close proxy to synthesised area.
We demonstrate experimentally that our methodology converges better to low-area
solutions and that it can find better approximations than both the original
XPAT and two other state-of-the-art approaches.

Result: 融合潜在表示产生更结构化的模式，而单独表示在特定情况下更有用

Conclusion: 融合潜在数据表示在大多数情况下能产生更好的结构化模式，但单独表示在特定场景中仍有价值

Abstract: Urban analytics utilizes extensive datasets with diverse urban information to
simulate, predict trends, and uncover complex patterns within cities. While
these data enables advanced analysis, it also presents challenges due to its
granularity, heterogeneity, and multimodality. To address these challenges,
visual analytics tools have been developed to support the exploration of latent
representations of fused heterogeneous and multimodal data, discretized at a
street-level of detail. However, visualization-assisted tools seldom explore
the extent to which fused data can offer deeper insights than examining each
data source independently within an integrated visualization framework. In this
work, we developed a visualization-assisted framework to analyze whether fused
latent data representations are more effective than separate representations in
uncovering patterns from dynamic and static urban data. The analysis reveals
that combined latent representations produce more structured patterns, while
separate ones are useful in particular cases.

Abstract: Accurate risk assessment in lung cancer screening is critical for enabling
early cancer detection and minimizing unnecessary invasive procedures. The Lung
CT Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) has been widely used as the
standard framework for patient management and follow-up. Nevertheless,
Lung-RADS faces trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity, as it
stratifies risk solely based on lung nodule characteristics without
incorporating various risk factors. Here we propose a reasoning language model
(RLM) to integrate radiology findings with longitudinal medical records for
individualized lung cancer risk assessment. Through a systematic study
including dataset construction and distillation, supervised fine-tuning,
reinforcement learning, and comprehensive evaluation, our model makes
significant improvements in risk prediction performance on datasets in the
national lung screening trial. Notably, RLM can decompose the risk evaluation
task into sub-components, analyze the contributions of diverse risk factors,
and synthesize them into a final risk score computed using our data-driven
system equation. Our approach improves both predictive accuracy and
monitorability through the chain of thought reasoning process, thereby
facilitating clinical translation into lung cancer screening.

Abstract: Graph clustering under the framework of differential privacy, which aims to
process graph-structured data while protecting individual privacy, has been
receiving increasing attention. Despite significant achievements in current
research, challenges such as high noise, low efficiency and poor
interpretability continue to severely constrain the development of this field.
In this paper, we construct a differentially private and interpretable graph
clustering approach based on metric embedding initialization. Specifically, we
construct an SDP optimization, extract the key set and provide a
well-initialized clustering configuration using an HST-based initialization
method. Subsequently, we apply an established k-median clustering strategy to
derive the cluster results and offer comparative explanations for the query set
through differences from the cluster centers. Extensive experiments on public
datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms existing methods
in various clustering metrics while strictly ensuring privacy.

Abstract: Sixth generation (6G) systems require environment-aware communication, driven
by native artificial intelligence (AI) and integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC). Radio maps (RMs), providing spatially continuous channel information,
are key enablers. However, generating high-fidelity RM ground truth via
electromagnetic (EM) simulations is computationally intensive, motivating
machine learning (ML)-based RM construction. The effectiveness of these
data-driven methods depends on large-scale, high-quality training data. Current
public datasets often focus on single-input single-output (SISO) and limited
information, such as path loss, which is insufficient for advanced multi-input
multi-output (MIMO) systems requiring detailed channel state information (CSI).
To address this gap, this paper presents UrbanMIMOMap, a novel large-scale
urban MIMO CSI dataset generated using high-precision ray tracing. UrbanMIMOMap
offers comprehensive complex CSI matrices across a dense spatial grid, going
beyond traditional path loss data. This rich CSI is vital for constructing
high-fidelity RMs and serves as a fundamental resource for data-driven RM
generation, including deep learning. We demonstrate the dataset's utility
through baseline performance evaluations of representative ML methods for RM
construction. This work provides a crucial dataset and reference for research
in high-precision RM generation, MIMO spatial performance, and ML for 6G
environment awareness. The code and data for this work are available at:

Motivation: 在大型商业系统中，如何在保持响应质量的同时将查询路由到最具成本效益的LLM，优化性能-成本权衡是一个基本挑战。

Method: 提出模块化架构，使用在150万标注提示上训练的轻量级质量估计器；用户控制的容差参数路由机制；使用冻结编码器和模型特定适配器的可扩展设计。

Abstract: Routing incoming queries to the most cost-effective LLM while maintaining
response quality poses a fundamental challenge in optimizing performance-cost
trade-offs for large-scale commercial systems. We present IPR\, a
quality-constrained Intelligent Prompt Routing framework that dynamically
selects optimal models based on predicted response quality and user-specified
tolerance levels. IPR introduces three key innovations: (1) a modular
architecture with lightweight quality estimators trained on 1.5M prompts
annotated with calibrated quality scores, enabling fine-grained quality
prediction across model families; (2) a user-controlled routing mechanism with
tolerance parameter $\tau \in [0,1]$ that provides explicit control over
quality-cost trade-offs; and (3) an extensible design using frozen encoders
with model-specific adapters, reducing new model integration from days to
hours. To rigorously train and evaluate IPR, we curate an industrial-level
dataset IPRBench\footnote{IPRBench will be released upon legal approval.}, a
comprehensive benchmark containing 1.5 million examples with response quality
annotations across 11 LLM candidates. Deployed on a major cloud platform, IPR
achieves 43.9\% cost reduction while maintaining quality parity with the
strongest model in the Claude family and processes requests with sub-150ms
latency.

Abstract: Personalization is a core capability across consumer technologies, streaming,
shopping, wearables, and voice, yet it remains challenged by sparse
interactions, fast content churn, and heterogeneous textual signals. We present
RecMind, an LLM-enhanced graph recommender that treats the language model as a
preference prior rather than a monolithic ranker. A frozen LLM equipped with
lightweight adapters produces text-conditioned user/item embeddings from
titles, attributes, and reviews; a LightGCN backbone learns collaborative
embeddings from the user-item graph. We align the two views with a symmetric
contrastive objective and fuse them via intra-layer gating, allowing language
to dominate in cold/long-tail regimes and graph structure to stabilize rankings
elsewhere. On Yelp and Amazon-Electronics, RecMind attains the best results on
all eight reported metrics, with relative improvements up to +4.53\%
(Recall@40) and +4.01\% (NDCG@40) over strong baselines. Ablations confirm both
the necessity of cross-view alignment and the advantage of gating over late
fusion and LLM-only variants.

Abstract: Silent Data Errors (SDEs) from time-zero defects and aging degrade
safety-critical systems. Functional testing detects SDE-related faults but is
expensive to simulate. We present a unified spatio-temporal graph convolutional
network (ST-GCN) for fast, accurate prediction of long-cycle fault impact
probabilities (FIPs) in large sequential circuits, supporting quantitative risk
assessment. Gate-level netlists are modeled as spatio-temporal graphs to
capture topology and signal timing; dedicated spatial and temporal encoders
predict multi-cycle FIPs efficiently. On ISCAS-89 benchmarks, the method
reduces simulation time by more than 10x while maintaining high accuracy (mean
absolute error 0.024 for 5-cycle predictions). The framework accepts features
from testability metrics or fault simulation, allowing efficiency-accuracy
trade-offs. A test-point selection study shows that choosing observation points
by predicted FIPs improves detection of long-cycle, hard-to-detect faults. The
approach scales to SoC-level test strategy optimization and fits downstream

Method: 基于对主流LLM结构特性的深入理解，提出输出近似方法LoaQ，明确针对输出级一致性，具有简单闭式解

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen模型家族上实验表明，LoaQ在仅权重量化和权重激活联合量化中均表现有效，能无缝集成现有量化策略

Conclusion: LoaQ能进一步提升整体量化质量，具有推动后训练量化前沿发展的强大潜力

Abstract: A natural and intuitive idea in model quantization is to approximate each
component's quantized output to match its original. Layer-wise post-training
quantization (PTQ), though based on this idea, adopts a strictly local view and
can achieve, at best, only activation-aware approximations of weights. As a
result, it often leads to insufficient approximations and practical deviations
from this guiding intuition. Recent work has achieved a more accurate
approximation of linear-layer outputs within the framework of layer-wise PTQ,
but such refinements remain inadequate for achieving alignment with the full
model output. Based on a deeper understanding of the structural characteristics
of mainstream LLMs, we propose $LoaQ$, an output-approximation method for
layer-wise PTQ that explicitly targets output-level consistency. It better
aligns with this intuition and can feature a simple closed-form solution,
making it orthogonal to existing techniques and readily integrable into
existing quantization pipelines. Experiments on the LLaMA and Qwen model
families demonstrate that LoaQ performs effectively in both weight-only and
weight-activation joint quantization. By integrating seamlessly with existing
quantization strategies, it further enhances overall quantization quality and
shows strong potential to advance the frontier of post-training quantization.

Abstract: High-quality wind power forecasting is crucial for the operation of modern
power grids. However, prevailing data-driven paradigms either train a
site-specific model which cannot generalize to other locations or rely on
fine-tuning of general-purpose time series foundation models which are
difficult to incorporate domain-specific data in the energy sector. This paper
introduces WindFM, a lightweight and generative Foundation Model designed
specifically for probabilistic wind power forecasting. WindFM employs a
discretize-and-generate framework. A specialized time-series tokenizer first
converts continuous multivariate observations into discrete, hierarchical
tokens. Subsequently, a decoder-only Transformer learns a universal
representation of wind generation dynamics by autoregressively pre-training on
these token sequences. Using the comprehensive WIND Toolkit dataset comprising
approximately 150 billion time steps from more than 126,000 sites, WindFM
develops a foundational understanding of the complex interplay between
atmospheric conditions and power output. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our compact 8.1M parameter model achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot
performance on both deterministic and probabilistic tasks, outperforming
specialized models and larger foundation models without any fine-tuning. In
particular, WindFM exhibits strong adaptiveness under out-of-distribution data
from a different continent, demonstrating the robustness and transferability of
its learned representations. Our pre-trained model is publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的冗余指数rho(C)，通过分析潜在表示中的耦合矩阵来直接量化维度间依赖性，为评估表示学习效率提供了统计基础的可解释指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度网络经常产生冗余的潜在空间，多个坐标编码重叠信息，降低了有效容量并阻碍泛化。标准指标如准确率或重建损失只能提供间接证据，无法直接隔离冗余问题。

Method: 通过分析潜在表示的耦合矩阵，比较其非对角线统计量与正态分布的能量距离，构建紧凑、可解释且统计基础化的冗余度量指标rho(C)。

Result: 在MNIST变体、Fashion-MNIST、CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上的实验表明，低rho(C)可靠地预测高分类准确率或低重建误差，而高冗余与性能崩溃相关。TPE优化器优先探索低rho区域。

Conclusion: rho(C)通过揭示跨模型和任务的冗余瓶颈，为评估和改进学习表示的效率提供了理论视角和实用工具，可用于神经架构搜索和冗余感知正则化。

Abstract: A central challenge in representation learning is constructing latent
embeddings that are both expressive and efficient. In practice, deep networks
often produce redundant latent spaces where multiple coordinates encode
overlapping information, reducing effective capacity and hindering
generalization. Standard metrics such as accuracy or reconstruction loss
provide only indirect evidence of such redundancy and cannot isolate it as a
failure mode. We introduce a redundancy index, denoted rho(C), that directly
quantifies inter-dimensional dependencies by analyzing coupling matrices
derived from latent representations and comparing their off-diagonal statistics
against a normal distribution via energy distance. The result is a compact,
interpretable, and statistically grounded measure of representational quality.
We validate rho(C) across discriminative and generative settings on MNIST
variants, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, spanning multiple
architectures and hyperparameter optimization strategies. Empirically, low
rho(C) reliably predicts high classification accuracy or low reconstruction
error, while elevated redundancy is associated with performance collapse.
Estimator reliability grows with latent dimension, yielding natural lower
bounds for reliable analysis. We further show that Tree-structured Parzen
Estimators (TPE) preferentially explore low-rho regions, suggesting that rho(C)
can guide neural architecture search and serve as a redundancy-aware
regularization target. By exposing redundancy as a universal bottleneck across
models and tasks, rho(C) offers both a theoretical lens and a practical tool
for evaluating and improving the efficiency of learned representations.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在零样本时间序列预测中的涌现能力，特别是如何在没有专门训练的情况下处理偏微分方程的时空动态预测问题。

Method: 使用文本训练的基础模型处理离散化的偏微分方程解，分析模型在不同时空离散化程度下的预测性能，并通过多步滚动预测和token级输出分布分析来理解模型内部处理机制。

Result: 模型能够准确外推时空动态，预测精度随上下文长度增加而提高，但在更精细的空间离散化下性能下降。多步预测中误差随时间范围代数增长，呈现出与经典有限差分求解器类似的全局误差累积模式。

Conclusion: LLMs通过上下文学习展现出处理偏微分方程解的强大能力，其预测质量随上下文长度和输出长度呈现可预测的变化规律，揭示了从语法模式模仿到数值预测的渐进式学习过程。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emergent in-context learning
(ICL) capabilities across a range of tasks, including zero-shot time-series
forecasting. We show that text-trained foundation models can accurately
extrapolate spatiotemporal dynamics from discretized partial differential
equation (PDE) solutions without fine-tuning or natural language prompting.
Predictive accuracy improves with longer temporal contexts but degrades at
finer spatial discretizations. In multi-step rollouts, where the model
recursively predicts future spatial states over multiple time steps, errors
grow algebraically with the time horizon, reminiscent of global error
accumulation in classical finite-difference solvers. We interpret these trends
as in-context neural scaling laws, where prediction quality varies predictably
with both context length and output length. To better understand how LLMs are
able to internally process PDE solutions so as to accurately roll them out, we
analyze token-level output distributions and uncover a consistent ICL
progression: beginning with syntactic pattern imitation, transitioning through
an exploratory high-entropy phase, and culminating in confident, numerically
grounded predictions.

Motivation: 研究如何利用机器学习分析患者生成的自由文本饮食记录，为精准医疗提供营养指导支持，解决传统人工评估的局限性

Method: 使用TFIDF和BERT文本嵌入，结合营养领域知识（本体、成分解析、宏量营养素信息）作为输入，评估逻辑回归和多层感知机分类器的性能

Result: 即使没有领域知识增强，机器学习也优于人工自我评估；最佳组合（ML分类器+领域知识增强）达到更高准确率，在多种营养目标上表现良好

Conclusion: 机器学习能够可靠地利用非结构化饮食日志文本分类膳食是否符合营养目标，特别是在融入营养领域知识后，为精准医疗中的患者中心营养指导提供了潜力

Abstract: This study examined the use of machine learning and domain specific
enrichment on patient generated health data, in the form of free text meal
logs, to classify meals on alignment with different nutritional goals. We used
a dataset of over 3000 meal records collected by 114 individuals from a
diverse, low income community in a major US city using a mobile app. Registered
dietitians provided expert judgement for meal to goal alignment, used as gold
standard for evaluation. Using text embeddings, including TFIDF and BERT, and
domain specific enrichment information, including ontologies, ingredient
parsers, and macronutrient contents as inputs, we evaluated the performance of
logistic regression and multilayer perceptron classifiers using accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score against the gold standard and self assessment.
Even without enrichment, ML outperformed self assessments of individuals who
logged meals, and the best performing combination of ML classifier with
enrichment achieved even higher accuracies. In general, ML classifiers with
enrichment of Parsed Ingredients, Food Entities, and Macronutrients information
performed well across multiple nutritional goals, but there was variability in
the impact of enrichment and classification algorithm on accuracy of
classification for different nutritional goals. In conclusion, ML can utilize
unstructured free text meal logs and reliably classify whether meals align with
specific nutritional goals, exceeding self assessments, especially when
incorporating nutrition domain knowledge. Our findings highlight the potential
of ML analysis of patient generated health data to support patient centered
nutrition guidance in precision healthcare.

Method: 逐渐增加复杂度的四类数学问题（基础运算、高级运算、质数检查、Game of 24数字谜题），测试多个先进LLM基于的组合系统

Result: 组合系统在前三类需要确定性算法执行的任务中准确率高，但在需要大规模组合空间向量搜索的数字谜题中一致失败

Conclusion: LLM的数值论证能力主要体现在记忆和执行已知算法上，而非真正的生成式问题解决能力，对需要创造性数值见解的任务有限

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable emergent
capabilities, yet the robustness of their numerical reasoning remains an open
question. While standard benchmarks evaluate LLM reasoning on complex problem
sets using aggregated metrics, they often obscure foundational weaknesses. In
this work, we probe LLM mathematical numeracy by evaluating performance on
problems of escalating complexity, from constituent operations to combinatorial
puzzles. We test several state-of-the-art LLM-based agents on a 100-problem
challenge comprising four categories: (1) basic arithmetic, (2) advanced
operations, (3) primality checking, and (4) the Game of 24 number puzzle. Our
results show that while the agents achieved high accuracy on the first three
categories, which require deterministic algorithmic execution, they
consistently failed at the number puzzle, underlining its demand for a
heuristic search over a large combinatorial space to be a significant
bottleneck. These findings reveal that the agents' proficiency is largely
confined to recalling and executing known algorithms, rather than performing
generative problem-solving. This suggests their apparent numerical reasoning is
more akin to sophisticated pattern-matching than flexible, analytical thought,
limiting their potential for tasks that require novel or creative numerical
insights.

Motivation: 现有MoE模型的路由器在预训练中过早收敛并强制平衡使用，导致关键专家利用不足和冗余问题，限制了模型性能和效率的潜力

Method: 提出Ban&Pick后训练策略：Pick组件发现并强化对性能影响大的关键专家；Ban组件根据层和token敏感性动态剪枝冗余专家

Result: 在DeepSeek和Qwen3等细粒度MoE-LLM上，AIME2024准确率从80.67提升至84.66，GPQA-Diamond从65.66提升至68.18，推理速度提升1.25倍

Conclusion: Ban&Pick无需重新训练或架构修改，即可为MoE模型带来免费的性能提升和推理加速，解决了路由优化中的关键专家利用不足和冗余问题

Abstract: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a key architecture for scaling
large language models (LLMs) efficiently. Recent fine-grained MoE designs
introduce hundreds of experts per layer, with multiple experts activated per
token, enabling stronger specialization. However, during pre-training, routers
are optimized mainly for stability and robustness: they converge prematurely
and enforce balanced usage, limiting the full potential of model performance
and efficiency. In this work, we uncover two overlooked issues: (i) a few
highly influential experts are underutilized due to premature and balanced
routing decisions; and (ii) enforcing a fixed number of active experts per
token introduces substantial redundancy. Instead of retraining models or
redesigning MoE architectures, we introduce Ban&Pick, a post-training,
plug-and-play strategy for smarter MoE routing. Pick discovers and reinforces
key experts-a small group with outsized impact on performance-leading to
notable accuracy gains across domains. Ban complements this by dynamically
pruning redundant experts based on layer and token sensitivity, delivering
faster inference with minimal accuracy loss. Experiments on fine-grained
MoE-LLMs (DeepSeek, Qwen3) across math, code, and general reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that Ban&Pick delivers free performance gains and inference
acceleration without retraining or architectural changes. For instance, on
Qwen3-30B-A3B, it improves accuracy from 80.67 to 84.66 on AIME2024 and from
65.66 to 68.18 on GPQA-Diamond, while accelerating inference by 1.25x under the
vLLM.

Motivation: 在大数据时代，从高维数据中选择关键变量变得越来越重要。稀疏回归通过促进模型简洁性和可解释性成为有力工具，但现有方法在高度稀疏场景下表现不佳。

Method: 改进变分门控(VG)方法，引入显式特征选择自旋变量，利用变分推理推导可处理的损失函数，并整合现代自动微分技术实现可扩展的高效优化。

Result: VG在高度稀疏场景下表现优异，比Ridge和LASSO回归提供更一致稳健的变量选择。发现了一个尖锐的过渡现象：当引入多余变量时，泛化能力急剧下降，选择变量的不确定性增加。

Conclusion: VG在稀疏建模方面具有强大潜力，过渡点为估计相关变量数量提供了实用信号，可成功应用于压缩感知和机器学习模型剪枝等广泛应用。

Abstract: Selecting key variables from high-dimensional data is increasingly important
in the era of big data. Sparse regression serves as a powerful tool for this
purpose by promoting model simplicity and explainability. In this work, we
revisit a valuable yet underutilized method, the statistical physics-based
Variational Garrote (VG), which introduces explicit feature selection spin
variables and leverages variational inference to derive a tractable loss
function. We enhance VG by incorporating modern automatic differentiation
techniques, enabling scalable and efficient optimization. We evaluate VG on
both fully controllable synthetic datasets and complex real-world datasets. Our
results demonstrate that VG performs especially well in highly sparse regimes,
offering more consistent and robust variable selection than Ridge and LASSO
regression across varying levels of sparsity. We also uncover a sharp
transition: as superfluous variables are admitted, generalization degrades
abruptly and the uncertainty of the selection variables increases. This
transition point provides a practical signal for estimating the correct number
of relevant variables, an insight we successfully apply to identify key
predictors in real-world data. We expect that VG offers strong potential for
sparse modeling across a wide range of applications, including compressed
sensing and model pruning in machine learning.

Conclusion: MGKD框架成功整合了服务中行为数据，通过知识蒸馏和多粒度策略显著提升了服务前风险评估性能，为解决金融风险管理中的数据隔离问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: Typical financial risk management involves distinct phases for pre-service
risk assessment and in-service default detection, often modeled separately.
This paper proposes a novel framework, Multi-Granularity Knowledge Distillation
(abbreviated as MGKD), aimed at improving pre-service risk prediction through
the integration of in-service user behavior data. MGKD follows the idea of
knowledge distillation, where the teacher model, trained on historical
in-service data, guides the student model, which is trained on pre-service
data. By using soft labels derived from in-service data, the teacher model
helps the student model improve its risk prediction prior to service
activation. Meanwhile, a multi-granularity distillation strategy is introduced,
including coarse-grained, fine-grained, and self-distillation, to align the
representations and predictions of the teacher and student models. This
approach not only reinforces the representation of default cases but also
enables the transfer of key behavioral patterns associated with defaulters from
the teacher to the student model, thereby improving the overall performance of
pre-service risk assessment. Moreover, we adopt a re-weighting strategy to
mitigate the model's bias towards the minority class. Experimental results on
large-scale real-world datasets from Tencent Mobile Payment demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed approach in both offline and online scenarios.

Conclusion: 该工作为未来无线网络的约束资源分配提供了一个可扩展且理论严谨的解决方案，结合了传统优化方法和深度学习的优势。

Abstract: Meeting minimum data rate constraints is a significant challenge in wireless
communication systems, particularly as network complexity grows. Traditional
deep learning approaches often address these constraints by incorporating
penalty terms into the loss function and tuning hyperparameters empirically.
However, this heuristic treatment offers no theoretical convergence guarantees
and frequently fails to satisfy QoS requirements in practical scenarios.
Building upon the structure of the WMMSE algorithm, we first extend it to a
multi-channel setting with QoS constraints, resulting in the enhanced WMMSE
(eWMMSE) algorithm, which is provably convergent to a locally optimal solution
when the problem is feasible. To further reduce computational complexity and
improve scalability, we develop a GNN-based algorithm, JCPGNN-M, capable of
supporting simultaneous multi-channel allocation per user. To overcome the
limitations of traditional deep learning methods, we propose a principled
framework that integrates GNN with a Lagrangian-based primal-dual optimization
method. By training the GNN within the Lagrangian framework, we ensure
satisfaction of QoS constraints and convergence to a stationary point.
Extensive simulations demonstrate that JCPGNN-M matches the performance of
eWMMSE while offering significant gains in inference speed, generalization to
larger networks, and robustness under imperfect channel state information. This
work presents a scalable and theoretically grounded solution for constrained
resource allocation in future wireless networks.

Abstract: On-device deep learning models have extensive real world demands. Deep
learning compilers efficiently compile models into executables for deployment
on edge devices, but these executables may face the threat of reverse
engineering. Previous studies have attempted to decompile DNN executables, but
they face challenges in handling compilation optimizations and analyzing
quantized compiled models. In this paper, we present NeuroDeX to unlock diverse
support in decompiling DNN executables. NeuroDeX leverages the semantic
understanding capabilities of LLMs along with dynamic analysis to accurately
and efficiently perform operator type recognition, operator attribute recovery
and model reconstruction. NeuroDeX can recover DNN executables into high-level
models towards compilation optimizations, different architectures and quantized
compiled models. We conduct experiments on 96 DNN executables across 12 common

decompile non-quantized executables into nearly identical high-level models.
NeuroDeX can recover functionally similar high-level models for quantized

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a vital yet challenging task,
particularly in scenarios where labeled anomalies are scarce and temporal
dependencies are complex. Recent anomaly assumption (AA) approaches alleviate
the lack of anomalies by injecting synthetic samples and training
discriminative models. Despite promising results, these methods often suffer
from two fundamental limitations: patchy generation, where scattered anomaly
knowledge leads to overly simplistic or incoherent anomaly injection, and
Anomaly Shift, where synthetic anomalies either resemble normal data too
closely or diverge unrealistically from real anomalies, thereby distorting
classification boundaries. In this paper, we propose CAPMix, a controllable
anomaly augmentation framework that addresses both issues. First, we design a
CutAddPaste mechanism to inject diverse and complex anomalies in a targeted
manner, avoiding patchy generation. Second, we introduce a label revision
strategy to adaptively refine anomaly labels, reducing the risk of anomaly
shift. Finally, we employ dual-space mixup within a temporal convolutional
network to enforce smoother and more robust decision boundaries. Extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets, including AIOps, UCR, SWaT, WADI, and
ESA, demonstrate that CAPMix achieves significant improvements over
state-of-the-art baselines, with enhanced robustness against contaminated
training data. The code is available at https://github.com/alsike22/CAPMix.

Abstract: Antibody binding site prediction plays a pivotal role in computational
immunology and therapeutic antibody design. Existing sequence or structure
methods rely on single-view features and fail to identify antibody-specific
binding sites on the antigens-a dual limitation in representation and
prediction. In this paper, we propose CAME-AB, a novel Cross-modality Attention
framework with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) backbone for robust antibody binding
site prediction. CAME-AB integrates five biologically grounded modalities,
including raw amino acid encodings, BLOSUM substitution profiles, pretrained
language model embeddings, structure-aware features, and GCN-refined
biochemical graphs-into a unified multimodal representation. To enhance
adaptive cross-modal reasoning, we propose an adaptive modality fusion module
that learns to dynamically weight each modality based on its global relevance
and input-specific contribution. A Transformer encoder combined with an MoE
module further promotes feature specialization and capacity expansion. We
additionally incorporate a supervised contrastive learning objective to
explicitly shape the latent space geometry, encouraging intra-class compactness
and inter-class separability. To improve optimization stability and
generalization, we apply stochastic weight averaging during training. Extensive
experiments on benchmark antibody-antigen datasets demonstrate that CAME-AB
consistently outperforms strong baselines on multiple metrics, including
Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and MCC. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of each architectural component and the benefit of
multimodal feature integration. The model implementation details and the codes

Abstract: The wide spreading of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors generates vast
spatio-temporal data streams, but ensuring data credibility is a critical yet
unsolved challenge for applications like smart homes. While spatio-temporal
graph (STG) models are a leading paradigm for such data, they often fall short
in dynamic, human-centric environments due to two fundamental limitations: (1)
their reliance on static graph topologies, which fail to capture physical,
event-driven dynamics, and (2) their tendency to confuse spurious correlations
with true causality, undermining robustness in human-centric environments. To
address these gaps, we propose the Dynamic Causal Spatio-Temporal Graph Network
(DyC-STG), a novel framework designed for real-time data credibility analysis
in IoT. Our framework features two synergistic contributions: an event-driven
dynamic graph module that adapts the graph topology in real-time to reflect
physical state changes, and a causal reasoning module to distill causally-aware
representations by strictly enforcing temporal precedence. To facilitate the
research in this domain we release two new real-world datasets. Comprehensive
experiments show that DyC-STG establishes a new state-of-the-art, outperforming
the strongest baselines by 1.4 percentage points and achieving an F1-Score of
up to 0.930.

Abstract: The excess Gibbs energy plays a central role in chemical engineering and
chemistry, providing a basis for modeling the thermodynamic properties of
liquid mixtures. Predicting the excess Gibbs energy of multi-component mixtures
solely from the molecular structures of their components is a long-standing
challenge. In this work, we address this challenge by integrating physical laws
as hard constraints within a flexible neural network. The resulting model,
HANNA, was trained end-to-end on an extensive experimental dataset for binary
mixtures from the Dortmund Data Bank, guaranteeing thermodynamically consistent
predictions. A novel surrogate solver developed in this work enabled the
inclusion of liquid-liquid equilibrium data in the training process.
Furthermore, a geometric projection method was applied to enable robust
extrapolations to multi-component mixtures, without requiring additional
parameters. We demonstrate that HANNA delivers excellent predictions, clearly
outperforming state-of-the-art benchmark methods in accuracy and scope. The
trained model and corresponding code are openly available, and an interactive
interface is provided on our website, MLPROP.

distribution via a parameterized neural network (NN). While GANs have been
widely applied in reinforcement and semisupervised learning as well as computer
vision tasks, selecting their parameters often needs an exhaustive search and
only a few selection methods can be proved to be theoretically optimal. One of
the most promising GAN variants is the Wasserstein GAN (WGAN). Prior work on
optimal parameters for WGAN is limited to the linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG)
setting, where the NN is linear and the data is Gaussian. In this paper, we
focus on the characterization of optimal WGAN parameters beyond the LQG
setting. We derive closed-form optimal parameters for one-dimensional WGANs
when the NN has non-linear activation functions and the data is non-Gaussian.
To extend this to high-dimensional WGANs, we adopt the sliced Wasserstein
framework and replace the constraint on marginal distributions of the randomly
projected data by a constraint on the joint distribution of the original
(unprojected) data. We show that the linear generator can be asymptotically
optimal for sliced WGAN with non-Gaussian data. Empirical studies show that our
closed-form WGAN parameters have good convergence behavior with data under both
Gaussian and Laplace distributions. Also, compared to the r principal component
analysis (r-PCA) solution, our proposed solution for sliced WGAN can achieve
the same performance while requiring less computational resources.

*Zongheng Guo,Tao Chen,Manuela Ferrario*

TL;DR: QualityFM是一个用于PPG和ECG生理信号质量评估的多模态基础模型，通过大规模预训练和双轨架构实现高质量信号理解，在三个临床任务中表现出色


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICU和手术室中PPG和ECG信号质量差、不完整和不一致的问题导致假警报和诊断不准确，现有方法泛化性有限且需要大量标注数据

Method: 采用双轨架构处理不同质量的配对生理信号，使用自蒸馏策略，集成窗口稀疏注意力机制的Transformer模型，结合蒸馏损失和重构损失的复合损失函数

Result: 在超过2100万个30秒波形和17.9万小时数据上预训练，开发了三个参数规模不同的模型（9.6M到319M），在心室颤动假警报检测、房颤识别和动脉血压估计三个临床任务中表现优异

Conclusion: QualityFM提供了一个通用的生理信号质量理解基础模型，具有良好的跨任务迁移能力和实际应用价值，能够有效解决临床信号质量相关问题

Abstract: Photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) are commonly recorded in
intesive care unit (ICU) and operating room (OR). However, the high incidence
of poor, incomplete, and inconsistent signal quality, can lead to false alarms
or diagnostic inaccuracies. The methods explored so far suffer from limited
generalizability, reliance on extensive labeled data, and poor cross-task
transferability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce QualityFM, a novel
multimodal foundation model for these physiological signals, designed to
acquire a general-purpose understanding of signal quality. Our model is
pre-trained on an large-scale dataset comprising over 21 million 30-second
waveforms and 179,757 hours of data. Our approach involves a dual-track
architecture that processes paired physiological signals of differing quality,
leveraging a self-distillation strategy where an encoder for high-quality
signals is used to guide the training of an encoder for low-quality signals. To
efficiently handle long sequential signals and capture essential local
quasi-periodic patterns, we integrate a windowed sparse attention mechanism
within our Transformer-based model. Furthermore, a composite loss function,
which combines direct distillation loss on encoder outputs with indirect
reconstruction loss based on power and phase spectra, ensures the preservation
of frequency-domain characteristics of the signals. We pre-train three models
with varying parameter counts (9.6 M to 319 M) and demonstrate their efficacy
and practical value through transfer learning on three distinct clinical tasks:
false alarm of ventricular tachycardia detection, the identification of atrial
fibrillation and the estimation of arterial blood pressure (ABP) from PPG and
ECG signals.

Abstract: As a result of the growing importance of lane change intention prediction for
a safe and efficient driving experience in complex driving scenarios,
researchers have in recent years started to train novel machine learning
algorithms on available datasets with promising results. A shortcoming of this
recent research effort, though, is that the vast majority of the proposed
algorithms are trained on a single datasets. In doing so, researchers failed to
test if their algorithm would be as effective if tested on a different dataset
and, by extension, on a different population with respect to the one on which
they were trained. In this article we test a transformer designed for lane
change intention prediction on two datasets collected by LevelX in Germany and
Hong Kong. We found that the transformer's accuracy plummeted when tested on a
population different to the one it was trained on with accuracy values as low
as 39.43%, but that when trained on both populations simultaneously it could
achieve an accuracy as high as 86.71%. - This work has been submitted to the

Method: 使用部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程(POMDP)对CAGE-2进行建模，提出BF-PPO方法：基于PPO算法，利用粒子滤波处理大规模状态空间带来的计算复杂度问题。

Result: 在CAGE-2 CybORG环境中测试，BF-PPO方法在防御策略学习效果和训练时间两方面都超越了当前排行榜第一的CARDIFF方法。

Conclusion: 基于POMDP的形式化建模和BF-PPO方法能够有效解决CAGE-2网络安全防御问题，在性能和效率上都取得了显著提升。

Abstract: CAGE-2 is an accepted benchmark for learning and evaluating defender
strategies against cyberattacks. It reflects a scenario where a defender agent
protects an IT infrastructure against various attacks. Many defender methods
for CAGE-2 have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we construct a
formal model for CAGE-2 using the framework of Partially Observable Markov
Decision Process (POMDP). Based on this model, we define an optimal defender
strategy for CAGE-2 and introduce a method to efficiently learn this strategy.
Our method, called BF-PPO, is based on PPO, and it uses particle filter to
mitigate the computational complexity due to the large state space of the
CAGE-2 model. We evaluate our method in the CAGE-2 CybORG environment and
compare its performance with that of CARDIFF, the highest ranked method on the
CAGE-2 leaderboard. We find that our method outperforms CARDIFF regarding the
learned defender strategy and the required training time.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文开发了一种可解释的监督变分自编码器模型，用于基于孕期结果对胎心电图信号进行分类，在保持竞争性预测性能的同时提供部分临床意义特征编码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前深度学习方法在胎心电图分析中的可解释性限制问题，开发能够同时进行信号重建和结果预测的监督变分自编码器模型。

Method: 使用OxMat胎心电图数据集训练VAE模型，对五分钟胎心率段落进行分析，重点优化信号重建和结果预测，并结合Kullback-Leibler散度和总相关约束来结构潜在空间。

Result: 模型在段落层面得到AUROC 0.752，在整个胎心电图层面得到0.779。改进的TC约束提升了重建和分类性能。潜在空间分析显示基线相关特征得到良好表征，但短期和长期变异性编码较弱。

Conclusion: 这个监督VAE模型能够在保持竞争性胎儿结果预测的同时，部分编码具有临床意义的胎心电图特征，为未来可解释生成模型的开发奠定了基础。

Abstract: Objective: To develop and interpret a supervised variational autoencoder
(VAE) model for classifying cardiotocography (CTG) signals based on pregnancy
outcomes, addressing interpretability limits of current deep learning
approaches. Methods: The OxMat CTG dataset was used to train a VAE on
five-minute fetal heart rate (FHR) segments, labeled with postnatal outcomes.
The model was optimised for signal reconstruction and outcome prediction,
incorporating Kullback-Leibler divergence and total correlation (TC)
constraints to structure the latent space. Performance was evaluated using area
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and mean squared
error (MSE). Interpretability was assessed using coefficient of determination,
latent traversals and unsupervised component analyses. Results: The model
achieved an AUROC of 0.752 at the segment level and 0.779 at the CTG level,
where predicted scores were aggregated. Relaxing TC constraints improved both
reconstruction and classification. Latent analysis showed that baseline-related
features (e.g., FHR baseline, baseline shift) were well represented and aligned
with model scores, while metrics like short- and long-term variability were
less strongly encoded. Traversals revealed clear signal changes for baseline
features, while other properties were entangled or subtle. Unsupervised
decompositions corroborated these patterns. Findings: This work demonstrates
that supervised VAEs can achieve competitive fetal outcome prediction while
partially encoding clinically meaningful CTG features. The irregular,
multi-timescale nature of FHR signals poses challenges for disentangling
physiological components, distinguishing CTG from more periodic signals such as
ECG. Although full interpretability was not achieved, the model supports
clinically useful outcome prediction and provides a basis for future
interpretable, generative models.

Result: 在Lycos2017数据集上，二分类任务超越现有自监督和异常检测方法；使用有限标注数据微调后，多分类性能优于现有自监督模型

Conclusion: CLAN方法通过创新的负样本生成策略，显著提升了网络入侵检测的准确性和效率，为实际应用提供了更实用的解决方案

Abstract: Network intrusion detection remains a critical challenge in cybersecurity.
While supervised machine learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance,
their reliance on large labelled datasets makes them impractical for many
real-world applications. Anomaly detection methods, which train exclusively on
benign traffic to identify malicious activity, suffer from high false positive
rates, limiting their usability. Recently, self-supervised learning techniques
have demonstrated improved performance with lower false positive rates by
learning discriminative latent representations of benign traffic. In
particular, contrastive self-supervised models achieve this by minimizing the
distance between similar (positive) views of benign traffic while maximizing it
between dissimilar (negative) views. Existing approaches generate positive
views through data augmentation and treat other samples as negative. In
contrast, this work introduces Contrastive Learning using Augmented Negative
pairs (CLAN), a novel paradigm for network intrusion detection where augmented
samples are treated as negative views - representing potentially malicious
distributions - while other benign samples serve as positive views. This
approach enhances both classification accuracy and inference efficiency after
pretraining on benign traffic. Experimental evaluation on the Lycos2017 dataset
demonstrates that the proposed method surpasses existing self-supervised and
anomaly detection techniques in a binary classification task. Furthermore, when
fine-tuned on a limited labelled dataset, the proposed approach achieves
superior multi-class classification performance compared to existing
self-supervised models.

Method: 通过分析社区功能失调、研究优先级错配、数据碎片化和基础设施不平等四个相互关联的挑战，探讨其文化组织根源

Result: 发现AI科学发展的主要障碍来自文化组织实践，需要社区建设、跨学科教育、共享基准和可访问基础设施等综合解决方案

Conclusion: AI科学发展需要技术创新的同时，更需将可持续合作和公平参与作为技术进展的前提条件，重构为集体社会项目

Abstract: Artificial intelligence promises to accelerate scientific discovery, yet its
benefits remain unevenly distributed. While technical obstacles such as scarce
data, fragmented standards, and unequal access to computation are significant,
we argue that the primary barriers are social and institutional. Narratives
that defer progress to speculative "AI scientists," the undervaluing of data
and infrastructure contributions, misaligned incentives, and gaps between
domain experts and machine learning researchers all constrain impact. We
highlight four interconnected challenges: community dysfunction, research
priorities misaligned with upstream needs, data fragmentation, and
infrastructure inequities. We argue that their roots lie in cultural and
organizational practices. Addressing them requires not only technical
innovation but also intentional community-building, cross-disciplinary
education, shared benchmarks, and accessible infrastructure. We call for
reframing AI for science as a collective social project, where sustainable
collaboration and equitable participation are treated as prerequisites for
technical progress.

Motivation: 基于结果的强化学习虽然能显著提高准确性，但会导致系统性的生成多样性损失，这在实际应用中影响测试时的扩展性能

Method: 提出了两种互补算法：历史探索（通过UCB式奖励鼓励罕见答案）和批次探索（惩罚批次内重复以促进测试时多样性）

Result: 在Llama和Qwen模型上的标准数学竞赛实验表明，两种方法都能在提高准确性的同时缓解多样性崩溃

Conclusion: 基于结果的探索为增强推理能力而不牺牲多样性的RL方法提供了一条实用路径，这对可扩展部署至关重要

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful method for improving
the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Outcome-based RL,
which rewards policies solely for the correctness of the final answer, yields
substantial accuracy gains but also induces a systematic loss in generation
diversity. This collapse undermines real-world performance, where diversity is
critical for test-time scaling. We analyze this phenomenon by viewing RL
post-training as a sampling process and show that, strikingly, RL can reduce
effective diversity even on the training set relative to the base model. Our
study highlights two central findings: (i) a transfer of diversity degradation,
where reduced diversity on solved problems propagates to unsolved ones, and
(ii) the tractability of the outcome space, since reasoning tasks admit only a
limited set of distinct answers. Motivated by these insights, we propose
outcome-based exploration, which assigns exploration bonuses according to final
outcomes. We introduce two complementary algorithms: historical exploration,
which encourages rarely observed answers via UCB-style bonuses, and batch
exploration, which penalizes within-batch repetition to promote test-time
diversity. Experiments on standard competition math with Llama and Qwen models
demonstrate that both methods improve accuracy while mitigating diversity
collapse. On the theoretical side, we formalize the benefit of outcome-based
exploration through a new model of outcome-based bandits. Together, these
contributions chart a practical path toward RL methods that enhance reasoning
without sacrificing the diversity essential for scalable deployment.

Conclusion: 该框架为复杂动态非线性系统建模提供了可扩展的理论基础方法，解释了结构化残差学习在功率放大器线性化等实验中的经验优势，包括改进泛化、减少参数数量和降低训练成本。

Abstract: Dynamic nonlinear systems exhibit distortions arising from coupled static and
dynamic effects. Their intertwined nature poses major challenges for
data-driven modeling. This paper presents a theoretical framework grounded in
structured decomposition, variance analysis, and task-centric complexity
bounds.
  The framework employs a directional lower bound on interactions between
measurable system components, extending orthogonality in inner product spaces
to structurally asymmetric settings. This bound supports variance inequalities
for decomposed systems. Key behavioral indicators are introduced along with a
memory finiteness index. A rigorous power-based condition establishes a
measurable link between finite memory in realizable systems and the First Law
of Thermodynamics. This offers a more foundational perspective than classical
bounds based on the Second Law.
  Building on this foundation, we formulate a `Behavioral Uncertainty
Principle,' demonstrating that static and dynamic distortions cannot be
minimized simultaneously. We identify that real-world systems seem to resist
complete deterministic decomposition due to entangled static and dynamic
effects. We also present two general-purpose theorems linking function variance
to mean-squared Lipschitz continuity and learning complexity. This yields a
model-agnostic, task-aware complexity metric, showing that lower-variance
components are inherently easier to learn.
  These insights explain the empirical benefits of structured residual
learning, including improved generalization, reduced parameter count, and lower
training cost, as previously observed in power amplifier linearization
experiments. The framework is broadly applicable and offers a scalable,
theoretically grounded approach to modeling complex dynamic nonlinear systems.

Conclusion: 这项工作为理解和改进GNN在动态图环境中的泛化性能建立了理论基础，揭示了图拓扑结构对深层GCN泛化性能的重要影响。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in processing
graph-structured data across various applications. A critical aspect of
real-world graphs is their dynamic nature, where new nodes are continually
added and existing connections may change over time. Previous theoretical
studies, largely based on the transductive learning framework, fail to
adequately model such temporal evolution and structural dynamics. In this
paper, we presents a PAC-Bayesian theoretical analysis of graph convolutional
networks (GCNs) for inductive node classification, treating nodes as dependent
and non-identically distributed data points. We derive novel generalization
bounds for one-layer GCNs that explicitly incorporate the effects of data
dependency and non-stationarity, and establish sufficient conditions under
which the generalization gap converges to zero as the number of nodes
increases. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to two-layer GCNs, and reveal
that it requires stronger assumptions on graph topology to guarantee
convergence. This work establishes a theoretical foundation for understanding
and improving GNN generalization in dynamic graph environments.

Result: 代理抓取了94%高重要性信息，TBFact可以在不分享敏感数据的情况下进行本地化评估

Conclusion: HAO和TBFact为分子诊疗委员会提供了可靠、可扩展的自动化支持工具

Abstract: Molecular Tumor Boards (MTBs) are multidisciplinary forums where oncology
specialists collaboratively assess complex patient cases to determine optimal
treatment strategies. A central element of this process is the patient summary,
typically compiled by a medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, or surgeon,
or their trained medical assistant, who distills heterogeneous medical records
into a concise narrative to facilitate discussion. This manual approach is
often labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to omissions of critical
information. To address these limitations, we introduce the Healthcare Agent
Orchestrator (HAO), a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven AI agent that
coordinates a multi-agent clinical workflow to generate accurate and
comprehensive patient summaries for MTBs. Evaluating predicted patient
summaries against ground truth presents additional challenges due to stylistic
variation, ordering, synonym usage, and phrasing differences, which complicate
the measurement of both succinctness and completeness. To overcome these
evaluation hurdles, we propose TBFact, a ``model-as-a-judge'' framework
designed to assess the comprehensiveness and succinctness of generated
summaries. Using a benchmark dataset derived from de-identified tumor board
discussions, we applied TBFact to evaluate our Patient History agent. Results
show that the agent captured 94% of high-importance information (including
partial entailments) and achieved a TBFact recall of 0.84 under strict
entailment criteria. We further demonstrate that TBFact enables a data-free
evaluation framework that institutions can deploy locally without sharing
sensitive clinical data. Together, HAO and TBFact establish a robust foundation
for delivering reliable and scalable support to MTBs.

Abstract: The mechanisms by which reasoning training reshapes language-model
computations remain poorly understood. We study lightweight steering vectors
inserted into the base model's residual stream and trained with a
reinforcement-learning objective, which can match full fine-tuning performance
while retaining the interpretability of small, additive interventions. Using
logit-lens readouts, path patching, and circuit analyses, we analyze two models
and find: (i) the last-layer steering vector behaves like a token-substitution
bias concentrated on the first generated token, consistently boosting tokens
such as "To" and "Step"; and (ii) the penultimate-layer steering vector leaves
attention patterns largely unchanged and instead acts through the MLP and
unembedding, preferentially up-weighting process words and structure symbols.
These results establish a principled framework for interpreting the behavioral
changes induced by reasoning training.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has attracted increasing attention in recent
years for identifying malicious samples in a wide range of graph-based
applications, such as social media and e-commerce. However, most GAD methods
assume identical training and testing distributions and are tailored to
specific tasks, resulting in limited adaptability to real-world scenarios such
as shifting data distributions and scarce training samples in new applications.
To address the limitations, recent work has focused on improving the
generalization capability of GAD models through transfer learning that
leverages knowledge from related domains to enhance detection performance, or
developing "one-for-all" GAD foundation models that generalize across multiple
applications. Since a systematic understanding of generalization in GAD is
still lacking, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of
generalization in GAD. We first trace the evolution of generalization in GAD
and formalize the problem settings, which further leads to our systematic
taxonomy. Rooted in this fine-grained taxonomy, an up-to-date and comprehensive
review is conducted for the existing generalized GAD methods. Finally, we
identify current open challenges and suggest future directions to inspire
future research in this emerging field.

Motivation: 传统共情预测方法依赖主观报告和观察标签，存在偏见且无法客观捕捉共情形成过程；现有EEG方法主要提取静态模式，忽略时间动态性

Method: BEAM框架包含三个核心组件：1)LaBraM编码器进行时空特征提取，2)特征融合模块整合多视角信号，3)对比学习模块增强类别分离

Result: 在CBCP数据集上验证，BEAM在多个指标上优于最先进方法

Conclusion: BEAM为客观评估儿童共情提供了有效工具，并为早期干预儿童亲社会发展提供了初步见解

Abstract: Empathy in young children is crucial for their social and emotional
development, yet predicting it remains challenging. Traditional methods often
only rely on self-reports or observer-based labeling, which are susceptible to
bias and fail to objectively capture the process of empathy formation. EEG
offers an objective alternative; however, current approaches primarily extract
static patterns, neglecting temporal dynamics. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a novel deep learning framework, the Brainwave Empathy Assessment
Model (BEAM), to predict empathy levels in children aged 4-6 years. BEAM
leverages multi-view EEG signals to capture both cognitive and emotional
dimensions of empathy. The framework comprises three key components: 1) a
LaBraM-based encoder for effective spatio-temporal feature extraction, 2) a
feature fusion module to integrate complementary information from multi-view
signals, and 3) a contrastive learning module to enhance class separation.
Validated on the CBCP dataset, BEAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods across
multiple metrics, demonstrating its potential for objective empathy assessment
and providing a preliminary insight into early interventions in children's

### [368] [Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning for Stabilizing Near-Shortest Path Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06640)
*Yung-Fu Chen,Sen Lin,Anish Arora*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过深度神经网络学习本地路由策略，仅需单个图的少量数据样本即可学习到通用于各种几何随机图的路由策略，包括重现贪心转发策略和提出更优的GreedyTensile路由策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在各种几何随机图中实现高效、可扩展的全对路径路由问题，避免传统方法需要大量图数据进行训练的问题。

Method: 利用网络领域知识选择输入特征和设计策略函数，通过深度神经网络学习本地路由策略，仅需从单个"种子图"中采样少量数据。

Result: 学习到的策略能够精确重现贪心转发策略，并提出了更优的GreedyTensile路由策略（使用目标距离和节点伸缩特征），该策略几乎总是超过贪心转发。策略具有可解释性和超低延迟运行特性。

Conclusion: 该策略展示了基于深度学习的路由策略设计在使用少量数据情况下的效果和通用性，为网络路由问题提供了一种新的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a simple algorithm that needs only a few data samples from a
single graph for learning local routing policies that generalize across a rich
class of geometric random graphs in Euclidean metric spaces. We thus solve the
all-pairs near-shortest path problem by training deep neural networks (DNNs)
that let each graph node efficiently and scalably route (i.e., forward) packets
by considering only the node's state and the state of the neighboring nodes.
Our algorithm design exploits network domain knowledge in the selection of
input features and design of the policy function for learning an approximately
optimal policy. Domain knowledge also provides theoretical assurance that the
choice of a ``seed graph'' and its node data sampling suffices for
generalizable learning. Remarkably, one of these DNNs we train -- using
distance-to-destination as the only input feature -- learns a policy that
exactly matches the well-known Greedy Forwarding policy, which forwards packets
to the neighbor with the shortest distance to the destination. We also learn a
new policy, which we call GreedyTensile routing -- using both
distance-to-destination and node stretch as the input features -- that almost
always outperforms greedy forwarding. We demonstrate the explainability and
ultra-low latency run-time operation of Greedy Tensile routing by symbolically
interpreting its DNN in low-complexity terms of two linear actions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 基于群体效应的生成对抗模仿学习模型（gcGAIL），通过利用乘客群体共享行为模式提高个体旅行行为建模效率，解决传统MDP模型数据需求大、空间时间覆盖不充分等挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个体旅行行为响应模型对城市移动性规制和政策评估至关重要，但传统马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）模型需要大量数据且面临数据量、空间时间覆盖和情境多样性挑战

Method: 提出群体效应增强的生成对抗模仿学习（gcGAIL）模型，利用乘客群体之间的共享行为模式来提高个体行为建模效率

Result: 在公共交通票价折扣案例中，实验结果显示gcGAIL在准确性、普适性和模式展示效率方面都超过了伦比方法（AIRL、GAIL、cGAIL），对空间变化、数据稀疏性和行为多样性具有稳健性

Conclusion: gcGAIL模型能够预测任意时刻的个体行为响应，为个性化激励措施提供基础，实现更好的激励时机选择以引导可持续的行为改变

Abstract: Understanding and modeling individual travel behavior responses is crucial
for urban mobility regulation and policy evaluation. The Markov decision
process (MDP) provides a structured framework for dynamic travel behavior
modeling at the individual level. However, solving an MDP in this context is
highly data-intensive and faces challenges of data quantity, spatial-temporal
coverage, and situational diversity. To address these, we propose a
group-effect-enhanced generative adversarial imitation learning (gcGAIL) model
that improves the individual behavior modeling efficiency by leveraging shared
behavioral patterns among passenger groups. We validate the gcGAIL model using
a public transport fare-discount case study and compare against
state-of-the-art benchmarks, including adversarial inverse reinforcement
learning (AIRL), baseline GAIL, and conditional GAIL. Experimental results
demonstrate that gcGAIL outperforms these methods in learning individual travel
behavior responses to incentives over time in terms of accuracy,
generalization, and pattern demonstration efficiency. Notably, gcGAIL is robust
to spatial variation, data sparsity, and behavioral diversity, maintaining
strong performance even with partial expert demonstrations and underrepresented
passenger groups. The gcGAIL model predicts the individual behavior response at
any time, providing the basis for personalized incentives to induce sustainable
behavior changes (better timing of incentive injections).

*Xiaolu Fu,Ziyuan Bao,Eiman Kanjo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TrajAware是一个基于强化学习的VANET路由框架，通过动作空间剪枝、图交叉注意力和轨迹感知预测来解决动态拓扑和资源受限问题，在边缘设备上实现高效路由。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车载自组织网络(VANET)在智能交通系统中至关重要，但由于动态拓扑、不完全观测和边缘设备资源有限，路由仍然具有挑战性。现有RL方法假设固定图结构且需要重新训练，不适合在受限硬件上部署。

Method: TrajAware包含三个组件：(1)动作空间剪枝，减少冗余邻居选项但保持两跳可达性；(2)图交叉注意力，将剪枝后的邻居映射到全局图上下文；(3)轨迹感知预测，使用历史路线和路口信息估计实时位置。

Result: 在SUMO模拟器中使用真实城市地图进行评估，TrajAware实现了接近最短路径和高投递率，同时在完整和部分观测场景中都优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: TrajAware框架在保持边缘设备效率的同时，能够有效处理VANET中的动态路由问题，为边缘AI部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are a crucial component of intelligent
transportation systems; however, routing remains challenging due to dynamic
topologies, incomplete observations, and the limited resources of edge devices.
Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches often assume fixed graph
structures and require retraining when network conditions change, making them
unsuitable for deployment on constrained hardware. We present TrajAware, an
RL-based framework designed for edge AI deployment in VANETs. TrajAware
integrates three components: (i) action space pruning, which reduces redundant
neighbour options while preserving two-hop reachability, alleviating the curse
of dimensionality; (ii) graph cross-attention, which maps pruned neighbours to
the global graph context, producing features that generalise across diverse
network sizes; and (iii) trajectory-aware prediction, which uses historical
routes and junction information to estimate real-time positions under partial
observations. We evaluate TrajAware in the open-source SUMO simulator using
real-world city maps with a leave-one-city-out setup. Results show that
TrajAware achieves near-shortest paths and high delivery ratios while
maintaining efficiency suitable for constrained edge devices, outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines in both full and partial observation scenarios.

*Victor Toscano-Duran,Rocio Gonzalez-Diaz,Miguel A. Gutiérrez-Naranjo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的小型浅层神经网络Barycentric Neural Network (BNN)，利用重心坐标和固定基点来精确表示连续分段线性函数，并引入长度加权持久熵(LWPE)作为稳定的拓扑特征，通过优化基点而非内部权重来实现快速高效的非线性函数逼近。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度或过参数化神经网络计算成本高，需要一种在资源受限环境下（有限基点和训练轮次）能够提供灵活且可解释的函数逼近方法。

Method: 提出BNN网络结构，利用固定基点和重心坐标定义网络；引入LWPE作为损失函数；直接优化定义BNN的基点而非内部权重。

Result: 实验结果显示该方法相比MSE、RMSE、MAE和log-cosh等经典损失函数，实现了更优越和更快的逼近性能。

Conclusion: BNN结合LWPE损失函数为资源受限环境下的非线性连续函数逼近提供了灵活且几何可解释的解决方案，通过优化基点实现了高效计算。

Abstract: While it is well-established that artificial neural networks are
\emph{universal approximators} for continuous functions on compact domains,
many modern approaches rely on deep or overparameterized architectures that
incur high computational costs. In this paper, a new type of \emph{small
shallow} neural network, called the \emph{Barycentric Neural Network} ($\BNN$),
is proposed, which leverages a fixed set of \emph{base points} and their
\emph{barycentric coordinates} to define both its structure and its parameters.
We demonstrate that our $\BNN$ enables the exact representation of
\emph{continuous piecewise linear functions} ($\CPLF$s), ensuring strict
continuity across segments. Since any continuous function over a compact domain
can be approximated arbitrarily well by $\CPLF$s, the $\BNN$ naturally emerges
as a flexible and interpretable tool for \emph{function approximation}. Beyond
the use of this representation, the main contribution of the paper is the
introduction of a new variant of \emph{persistent entropy}, a topological
feature that is stable and scale invariant, called the \emph{length-weighted
persistent entropy} ($\LWPE$), which is weighted by the lifetime of topological
features. Our framework, which combines the $\BNN$ with a loss function based
on our $\LWPE$, aims to provide flexible and geometrically interpretable
approximations of nonlinear continuous functions in resource-constrained
settings, such as those with limited base points for $\BNN$ design and few
training epochs. Instead of optimizing internal weights, our approach directly
\emph{optimizes the base points that define the $\BNN$}. Experimental results
show that our approach achieves \emph{superior and faster approximation
performance} compared to classical loss functions such as MSE, RMSE, MAE, and
log-cosh.

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于概率建模的智能代理理论，证明在三个或更多结果空间中通过加权对数池化可以实现严格一致性，并形式化了LLM中的代理对齐现象（Luigi-Waluigi效应）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为神经模型建立智能代理的理论基础，研究子代理如何聚合成连贯的高层实体，为AI系统对齐提供数学框架。

Method: 使用概率建模表示代理为结果分布，以对数分数作为认知效用，通过加权对数池化定义组合，并应用克隆不变性、连续性和开放性等递归结构分析。

Result: 证明在线性池化或二元结果空间中无法实现严格一致性，但在三个以上结果空间中可能；形式化了LLM中的Luigi-Waluigi对齐现象，显示manifest-then-suppress策略比单纯强化Luigi能更有效减少一级错位。

Conclusion: 建立智能代理的数学理论框架为AI系统对齐提供了新的理论基础和实践指导，特别是对子代理聚合和高层实体形成机制的理解具有重要意义。

Abstract: We develop a theory of intelligent agency grounded in probabilistic modeling
for neural models. Agents are represented as outcome distributions with
epistemic utility given by log score, and compositions are defined through
weighted logarithmic pooling that strictly improves every member's welfare. We
prove that strict unanimity is impossible under linear pooling or in binary
outcome spaces, but possible with three or more outcomes. Our framework admits
recursive structure via cloning invariance, continuity, and openness, while
tilt-based analysis rules out trivial duplication. Finally, we formalize an
agentic alignment phenomenon in LLMs using our theory: eliciting a benevolent
persona ("Luigi'") induces an antagonistic counterpart ("Waluigi"), while a
manifest-then-suppress Waluigi strategy yields strictly larger first-order
misalignment reduction than pure Luigi reinforcement alone. These results
clarify how developing a principled mathematical framework for how subagents
can coalesce into coherent higher-level entities provides novel implications
for alignment in agentic AI systems.

Abstract: Simulating realistic financial time series is essential for stress testing,
scenario generation, and decision-making under uncertainty. Despite advances in
deep generative models, there is no consensus metric for their evaluation. We
focus on generative AI for financial time series in decision-making
applications and employ the nested optimal transport distance, a time-causal
variant of optimal transport distance, which is robust to tasks such as
hedging, optimal stopping, and reinforcement learning. Moreover, we propose a
statistically consistent, naturally parallelizable algorithm for its
computation, achieving substantial speedups over existing approaches.

Conclusion: 该研究通过创新的框架和算法设计，有效解决了机器人直接学习中的样本效率和实时控制挑战

Abstract: Learning a controller directly on the robot requires extreme sample
efficiency. Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods are the most sample
efficient, but they often suffer from a too long inference time to meet the
robot control frequency requirements. In this paper, we address the sample
efficiency and inference time challenges with two contributions. First, we
define a general framework to deal with inference delays where the slow
inference robot controller provides a sequence of actions to feed the
control-hungry robotic platform without execution gaps. Then, we compare
several RL algorithms in the light of this framework and propose RT-HCP, an
algorithm that offers an excellent trade-off between performance, sample
efficiency and inference time. We validate the superiority of RT-HCP with
experiments where we learn a controller directly on a simple but high frequency

TL;DR: LR-GWN通过将图小波滤波器分解为局部和全局组件，解决了图神经网络中长距离交互建模的挑战，在长距离基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于小波的图神经网络依赖有限阶多项式近似，限制了感受野并阻碍了长距离传播，需要新的方法来同时捕获局部和全局结构。

Method: 提出长距离图小波网络(LR-GWN)，将小波滤波器分解为互补的局部和全局组件：局部聚合使用高效低阶多项式处理，长距离交互通过灵活的谱域参数化捕获。

Result: 实验表明LR-GWN在长距离基准测试中达到基于小波方法的最先进性能，同时在短距离数据集上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 这种混合设计在原则性小波框架内统一了短距离和长距离信息流，为图机器学习中的长距离交互建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling long-range interactions, the propagation of information across
distant parts of a graph, is a central challenge in graph machine learning.
Graph wavelets, inspired by multi-resolution signal processing, provide a
principled way to capture both local and global structures. However, existing
wavelet-based graph neural networks rely on finite-order polynomial
approximations, which limit their receptive fields and hinder long-range
propagation. We propose Long-Range Graph Wavelet Networks (LR-GWN), which
decompose wavelet filters into complementary local and global components. Local
aggregation is handled with efficient low-order polynomials, while long-range
interactions are captured through a flexible spectral domain parameterization.
This hybrid design unifies short- and long-distance information flow within a
principled wavelet framework. Experiments show that LR-GWN achieves
state-of-the-art performance among wavelet-based methods on long-range
benchmarks, while remaining competitive on short-range datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多模态理解方面取得显著进展，但如何通过微调使其与人类价值观对齐、适应特定任务和行为仍然是一个关键挑战。

Method: 探索DRL和DPO两种范式：DRL通过奖励信号优化模型行为，DPO直接根据偏好数据对齐策略而无需显式奖励模型。分析了偏好数据来源、奖励信号以及不同方法分类。

Result: 提出了系统性的微调框架分类，明确了DRL和DPO在模型对齐中的各自优势和应用场景，为构建更鲁棒的人类对齐模型提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: DRL和DPO技术为LVLMs的价值观对齐提供了有效途径，但在可扩展性、样本效率、持续学习、泛化能力和安全性等方面仍存在开放挑战，需要进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) or multimodal large language models
represent a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, enabling
systems to understand and generate content across both visual and textual
modalities. While large-scale pretraining has driven substantial progress,
fine-tuning these models for aligning with human values or engaging in specific
tasks or behaviors remains a critical challenge. Deep Reinforcement Learning
(DRL) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) offer promising frameworks for
this aligning process. While DRL enables models to optimize actions using
reward signals instead of relying solely on supervised preference data, DPO
directly aligns the policy with preferences, eliminating the need for an
explicit reward model. This overview explores paradigms for fine-tuning LVLMs,
highlighting how DRL and DPO techniques can be used to align models with human
preferences and values, improve task performance, and enable adaptive
multimodal interaction. We categorize key approaches, examine sources of
preference data, reward signals, and discuss open challenges such as
scalability, sample efficiency, continual learning, generalization, and safety.
The goal is to provide a clear understanding of how DRL and DPO contribute to
the evolution of robust and human-aligned LVLMs.

TL;DR: 提出异步消息传递框架解决GNN中的过度压缩问题，通过基于节点中心性的批处理更新节点特征，在长距离交互任务中取得显著性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络(GNN)在处理需要长距离交互的任务时存在过度压缩(Oversquashing)问题，传统图重连方法会破坏归纳偏置并导致信息损失，而增加通道容量又会增加模型复杂度

Method: 提出模型无关的异步消息传递框架，每层基于节点中心性值创建节点批次，只更新批次内节点的特征，实现跨层的顺序信息处理，避免同时压缩到固定容量通道

Result: 在6个标准图数据集和2个长距离数据集上进行图分类，在REDDIT-BINARY和Peptides-struct上分别获得5%和4%的性能提升

Conclusion: 异步消息传递框架能有效缓解GNN的过度压缩问题，保持更高的特征敏感度边界，在长距离任务中表现优异且不增加模型复杂度

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) suffer from Oversquashing, which occurs when
tasks require long-range interactions. The problem arises from the presence of
bottlenecks that limit the propagation of messages among distant nodes.
Recently, graph rewiring methods modify edge connectivity and are expected to
perform well on long-range tasks. Yet, graph rewiring compromises the inductive
bias, incurring significant information loss in solving the downstream task.
Furthermore, increasing channel capacity may overcome information bottlenecks
but enhance the parameter complexity of the model. To alleviate these
shortcomings, we propose an efficient model-agnostic framework that
asynchronously updates node features, unlike traditional synchronous message
passing GNNs. Our framework creates node batches in every layer based on the
node centrality values. The features of the nodes belonging to these batches
will only get updated. Asynchronous message updates process information
sequentially across layers, avoiding simultaneous compression into
fixed-capacity channels. We also theoretically establish that our proposed
framework maintains higher feature sensitivity bounds compared to standard
synchronous approaches. Our framework is applied to six standard graph datasets
and two long-range datasets to perform graph classification and achieves
impressive performances with a $5\%$ and $4\%$ improvements on REDDIT-BINARY
and Peptides-struct, respectively.

Motivation: 离线目标条件强化学习在自主导航和运动控制等领域的应用受到状态-动作空间覆盖有限和长时程任务泛化困难的挑战

Method: 基于Eikonal偏微分方程推导物理信息正则化损失，结合分层隐式Q学习算法，形成Pi-HIQL方法

Result: 在性能表现和泛化能力方面取得显著提升，特别是在拼接机制和大规模导航任务中效果明显

Conclusion: 物理信息正则化方法为离线目标条件强化学习提供了有效的几何归纳偏置，能够改善值函数学习并提升算法性能

Abstract: Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) holds great promise
for domains such as autonomous navigation and locomotion, where collecting
interactive data is costly and unsafe. However, it remains challenging in
practice due to the need to learn from datasets with limited coverage of the
state-action space and to generalize across long-horizon tasks. To improve on
these challenges, we propose a Physics-informed (Pi) regularized loss for value
learning, derived from the Eikonal Partial Differential Equation (PDE) and
which induces a geometric inductive bias in the learned value function. Unlike
generic gradient penalties that are primarily used to stabilize training, our
formulation is grounded in continuous-time optimal control and encourages value
functions to align with cost-to-go structures. The proposed regularizer is
broadly compatible with temporal-difference-based value learning and can be
integrated into existing Offline GCRL algorithms. When combined with
Hierarchical Implicit Q-Learning (HIQL), the resulting method, Physics-informed
HIQL (Pi-HIQL), yields significant improvements in both performance and
generalization, with pronounced gains in stitching regimes and large-scale
navigation tasks.

Conclusion: 安全-by-协同进化是一种有前景的新形式，R²AI框架为AI向AGI和ASI发展提供了主动、可扩展的安全保障方案

Abstract: In this position paper, we address the persistent gap between rapidly growing
AI capabilities and lagging safety progress. Existing paradigms divide into
``Make AI Safe'', which applies post-hoc alignment and guardrails but remains
brittle and reactive, and ``Make Safe AI'', which emphasizes intrinsic safety
but struggles to address unforeseen risks in open-ended environments. We
therefore propose \textit{safe-by-coevolution} as a new formulation of the
``Make Safe AI'' paradigm, inspired by biological immunity, in which safety
becomes a dynamic, adversarial, and ongoing learning process. To operationalize
this vision, we introduce \texttt{R$^2$AI} -- \textit{Resistant and Resilient
AI} -- as a practical framework that unites resistance against known threats
with resilience to unforeseen risks. \texttt{R$^2$AI} integrates \textit{fast
and slow safe models}, adversarial simulation and verification through a
\textit{safety wind tunnel}, and continual feedback loops that guide safety and
capability to coevolve. We argue that this framework offers a scalable and
proactive path to maintain continual safety in dynamic environments, addressing
both near-term vulnerabilities and long-term existential risks as AI advances
toward AGI and ASI.

Conclusion: floq展示了迭代计算在值学习中的潜力，通过适当设置积分步骤数，能够实现对Q函数容量的更精细控制和扩展。

Abstract: A hallmark of modern large-scale machine learning techniques is the use of
training objectives that provide dense supervision to intermediate
computations, such as teacher forcing the next token in language models or
denoising step-by-step in diffusion models. This enables models to learn
complex functions in a generalizable manner. Motivated by this observation, we
investigate the benefits of iterative computation for temporal difference (TD)
methods in reinforcement learning (RL). Typically they represent value
functions in a monolithic fashion, without iterative compute. We introduce floq
(flow-matching Q-functions), an approach that parameterizes the Q-function
using a velocity field and trains it using techniques from flow-matching,
typically used in generative modeling. This velocity field underneath the flow
is trained using a TD-learning objective, which bootstraps from values produced
by a target velocity field, computed by running multiple steps of numerical
integration. Crucially, floq allows for more fine-grained control and scaling
of the Q-function capacity than monolithic architectures, by appropriately
setting the number of integration steps. Across a suite of challenging offline
RL benchmarks and online fine-tuning tasks, floq improves performance by nearly
1.8x. floq scales capacity far better than standard TD-learning architectures,
highlighting the potential of iterative computation for value learning.

Conclusion: AxelSMOTE通过智能体交互机制有效解决了传统过采样方法的局限性，为类别不平衡问题提供了创新的解决方案。

Abstract: Class imbalance in machine learning poses a significant challenge, as skewed
datasets often hinder performance on minority classes. Traditional oversampling
techniques, which are commonly used to alleviate class imbalance, have several
drawbacks: they treat features independently, lack similarity-based controls,
limit sample diversity, and fail to manage synthetic variety effectively. To
overcome these issues, we introduce AxelSMOTE, an innovative agent-based
approach that views data instances as autonomous agents engaging in complex
interactions. Based on Axelrod's cultural dissemination model, AxelSMOTE
implements four key innovations: (1) trait-based feature grouping to preserve
correlations; (2) a similarity-based probabilistic exchange mechanism for
meaningful interactions; (3) Beta distribution blending for realistic
interpolation; and (4) controlled diversity injection to avoid overfitting.
Experiments on eight imbalanced datasets demonstrate that AxelSMOTE outperforms
state-of-the-art sampling methods while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Targeted data poisoning attacks pose an increasingly serious threat due to
their ease of deployment and high success rates. These attacks aim to
manipulate the prediction for a single test sample in classification models.
Unlike indiscriminate attacks that aim to decrease overall test performance,
targeted attacks present a unique threat to individual test instances. This
threat model raises a fundamental question: what factors make certain test
samples more susceptible to successful poisoning than others? We investigate
how attack difficulty varies across different test instances and identify key
characteristics that influence vulnerability. This paper introduces three
predictive criteria for targeted data poisoning difficulty: ergodic prediction
accuracy (analyzed through clean training dynamics), poison distance, and
poison budget. Our experimental results demonstrate that these metrics
effectively predict the varying difficulty of real-world targeted poisoning
attacks across diverse scenarios, offering practitioners valuable insights for
vulnerability assessment and understanding data poisoning attacks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对噪声标签环境下鲁棒OOD检测的新框架，结合损失校正和低秩稀疏分解方法，在严重噪声标签设置下显著优于现有技术


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法在噪声训练标签下的效果未被充分研究，标签噪声会显著降低OOD性能，而直接将噪声标签鲁棒方法与OOD检测策略结合不足以解决这一关键挑战

Method: 集成噪声标签学习文献中的损失校正技术与信号处理中的低秩稀疏分解方法，构建鲁棒OOD检测框架

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在严重噪声标签设置下显著优于最先进的OOD检测技术

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了噪声标签环境下的OOD检测问题，为安全关键AI系统提供了更可靠的解决方案

Abstract: Robust out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is an indispensable component of
modern artificial intelligence (AI) systems, especially in safety-critical
applications where models must identify inputs from unfamiliar classes not seen
during training. While OOD detection has been extensively studied in the
machine learning literature--with both post hoc and training-based
approaches--its effectiveness under noisy training labels remains
underexplored. Recent studies suggest that label noise can significantly
degrade OOD performance, yet principled solutions to this issue are lacking. In
this work, we demonstrate that directly combining existing label noise-robust
methods with OOD detection strategies is insufficient to address this critical
challenge. To overcome this, we propose a robust OOD detection framework that
integrates loss correction techniques from the noisy label learning literature
with low-rank and sparse decomposition methods from signal processing.
Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art OOD detection
techniques, particularly under severe noisy label settings.

TL;DR: SEELE是一个新颖的监督辅助RLVR框架，通过动态调整问题难度来提升大型语言模型的推理能力探索效率，在数学推理基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法存在探索效率低下的问题，当问题过于困难时模型无法发现可行的推理路径，而问题过于简单时学习效果有限，需要解决难度与模型能力不匹配的问题。

Method: 提出SEELE框架，通过为每个训练样本添加自适应长度的提示（部分解决方案），使用多轮采样策略和项目反应理论模型来动态确定最优提示长度，实现实例级别的实时难度调整。

Result: 在六个数学推理基准测试中，SEELE比GRPO和SFT分别高出11.8和10.5个百分点，比之前最好的监督辅助方法平均高出3.6个百分点。

Conclusion: SEELE通过动态调整问题难度，有效解决了RLVR中的探索效率问题，显著提升了大型语言模型的推理能力，为难度自适应学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has achieved remarkable
success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing RLVR methods often suffer from exploration
inefficiency due to mismatches between the training data's difficulty and the
model's capability. LLMs fail to discover viable reasoning paths when problems
are overly difficult, while learning little new capability when problems are
too simple. In this work, we formalize the impact of problem difficulty by
quantifying the relationship between loss descent speed and rollout accuracy.
Building on this analysis, we propose SEELE, a novel supervision-aided RLVR
framework that dynamically adjusts problem difficulty to stay within the
high-efficiency region. SEELE augments each training sample by appending a hint
(part of a full solution) after the original problem. Unlike previous
hint-based approaches, SEELE deliberately and adaptively adjusts the hint
length for each problem to achieve an optimal difficulty. To determine the
optimal hint length, SEELE employs a multi-round rollout sampling strategy. In
each round, it fits an item response theory model to the accuracy-hint pairs
collected in preceding rounds to predict the required hint length for the next
round. This instance-level, real-time difficulty adjustment aligns problem
difficulty with the evolving model capability, thereby improving exploration
efficiency. Experimental results show that SEELE outperforms Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) by +11.8 and +10.5
points, respectively, and surpasses the best previous supervision-aided
approach by +3.6 points on average across six math reasoning benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中子反射法需要解决复杂的逆向模型问题，传统优化方法效率低且失去物理直觉，需要新方法来提高分析效率保持物理意义

Method: 使用自动微分技术计算错误函数对参数的准确梯度，对正向反射模型本身进行梯度下降优化

Conclusion: 该方法为中子反射法数据分析提供了高效的梯度基优化方法，保持了物理直觉，并通过开源库使其能够应用于其他数据集

Abstract: Neutron reflectometry (NR) is a powerful technique to probe surfaces and
interfaces. NR is inherently an indirect measurement technique, access to the
physical quantities of interest (layer thickness, scattering length density,
roughness), necessitate the solution of an inverse modelling problem, that is
inefficient for large amounts of data or complex multiplayer structures (e.g.
lithium batteries / electrodes). Recently, surrogate machine learning models
have been proposed as an alternative to existing optimisation routines.
Although such approaches have been successful, physical intuition is lost when
replacing governing equations with fast neural networks. Instead, we propose a
novel and efficient approach; to optimise reflectivity data analysis by
performing gradient descent on the forward reflection model itself. Herein,
automatic differentiation techniques are used to evaluate exact gradients of
the error function with respect to the parameters of interest. Access to these
quantities enables users of neutron reflectometry to harness a host of powerful
modern optimisation and inference techniques that remain thus far unexploited
in the context of neutron reflectometry. This paper presents two benchmark case
studies; demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on a thick oxide quartz
film, and robust co-fitting performance in the high complexity regime of
organic LED multilayer devices. Additionally, we provide an open-source library
of differentiable reflectometry kernels in the python programming language so
that gradient based approaches can readily be applied to other NR datasets.

Motivation: 研究神经网络如何学习群论中的词操作，特别是解释grokking现象背后的机制，以及网络如何利用有限宽度实现通用化的近似。

Method: 将词操作学习问题重构为3-张量学习问题，利用群的自共轭表示分解和融合结构来寻找低秩实现。通过替代模型分析网络如何找到这些低秩实现。

Result: 证明神经网络能够找到低秩张量实现，有效近似词操作。对于乘法词操作，网络实现了类似Strassen矩阵乘法的高效计算方式。

Conclusion: 该工作揭示了神经网络学习群论操作的机制，特别是grokking现象的形成过程，以及网络如何通过低秩分解实现高效计算。

Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that a simple two-layer neural network with
standard activation functions can learn an arbitrary word operation in any
finite group, provided sufficient width is available and exhibits grokking
while doing so. To explain the mechanism by which this is achieved, we reframe
the problem as that of learning a particular $3$-tensor, which we show is
typically of low rank. A key insight is that low-rank implementations of this
tensor can be obtained by decomposing it along triplets of basic self-conjugate
representations of the group and leveraging the fusion structure to rule out
many components. Focusing on a phenomenologically similar but more tractable
surrogate model, we show that the network is able to find such low-rank
implementations (or approximations thereof), thereby using limited width to
approximate the word-tensor in a generalizable way. In the case of the simple
multiplication word, we further elucidate the form of these low-rank
implementations, showing that the network effectively implements efficient
matrix multiplication in the sense of Strassen. Our work also sheds light on
the mechanism by which a network reaches such a solution under gradient
descent.

TL;DR: 本文通过稀疏自编码器分析transformer模型中的概念表示，揭示了输入不确定性增加时模型激活输入不敏感的语义特征导致幻觉的机制，并发现纯噪声输入也能触发有意义的内部概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI系统在科学、商业和政府领域的普及，理解其失败模式（如幻觉问题）对于高风险应用中的信任和采用至关重要。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器捕捉预训练transformer模型中的概念表示，在实验控制输入空间不确定性的场景下系统分析幻觉产生机制。

Result: 研究发现随着输入信息变得非结构化，模型使用的语义概念数量增加；在输入不确定性增大时，模型倾向于激活连贯但输入不敏感的语义特征，导致幻觉输出；纯噪声输入也能触发有意义的内部概念。

Conclusion: transformer模型的内部处理机制研究对AI模型对齐、AI安全、对抗攻击防护以及自动量化模型幻觉风险具有重要意义。

Abstract: As generative AI systems become competent and democratized in science,
business, and government, deeper insight into their failure modes now poses an
acute need. The occasional volatility in their behavior, such as the propensity
of transformer models to hallucinate, impedes trust and adoption of emerging AI
solutions in high-stakes areas. In the present work, we establish how and when
hallucinations arise in pre-trained transformer models through concept
representations captured by sparse autoencoders, under scenarios with
experimentally controlled uncertainty in the input space. Our systematic
experiments reveal that the number of semantic concepts used by the transformer
model grows as the input information becomes increasingly unstructured. In the
face of growing uncertainty in the input space, the transformer model becomes
prone to activate coherent yet input-insensitive semantic features, leading to
hallucinated output. At its extreme, for pure-noise inputs, we identify a wide
variety of robustly triggered and meaningful concepts in the intermediate
activations of pre-trained transformer models, whose functional integrity we
confirm through targeted steering. We also show that hallucinations in the
output of a transformer model can be reliably predicted from the concept
patterns embedded in transformer layer activations. This collection of insights
on transformer internal processing mechanics has immediate consequences for
aligning AI models with human values, AI safety, opening the attack surface for
potential adversarial attacks, and providing a basis for automatic
quantification of a model's hallucination risk.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 本文评估了混合种群元启发式算法在不同目标空间变换下的鲁棒性和结构不变性，发现基于差分进化的混合算法在各种变形下保持高精度和稳定性，而经典算法（特别是PSO和HHO变体）在不可分离或扭曲的景观下性能显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估混合种群元启发式算法在目标空间变换下的鲁棒性和结构不变性，为现实世界优化任务中选择适应性强的算法提供指导。

Method: 将轻量级即插即用混合算子应用于19种最先进算法（包括DE、PSO和生物启发方法），在CEC-2017测试套件上跨4个维度（10、30、50、100）进行基准测试，测试5种变换类型：基线、平移、缩放、旋转和常数偏移。

Result: 基于Wilcoxon和Friedman检验、贝叶斯优势分析和收敛轨迹分析的统计比较一致表明，基于差分的混合算法（如hIMODE、hSHADE、hDMSSA）在所有测试变形下保持高精度、稳定性和不变性。

Conclusion: 研究结果证实了自适应、结构弹性强的混合算法对于受领域特定变换影响的现实世界优化任务的优越性。

Abstract: This paper evaluates the robustness and structural invariance of hybrid
population-based metaheuristics under various objective space transformations.
A lightweight plug-and-play hybridization operator is applied to nineteen
state-of-the-art algorithms-including differential evolution (DE), particle
swarm optimization (PSO), and recent bio-inspired methods-without modifying
their internal logic. Benchmarking on the CEC-2017 suite across four dimensions
(10, 30, 50, 100) is performed under five transformation types: baseline,
translation, scaling, rotation, and constant shift. Statistical comparisons
based on Wilcoxon and Friedman tests, Bayesian dominance analysis, and
convergence trajectory profiling consistently show that differential-based
hybrids (e.g., hIMODE, hSHADE, hDMSSA) maintain high accuracy, stability, and
invariance under all tested deformations. In contrast, classical
algorithms-especially PSO- and HHO-based variants-exhibit significant
performance degradation under non-separable or distorted landscapes. The
findings confirm the superiority of adaptive, structurally resilient hybrids
for real-world optimization tasks subject to domain-specific transformations.

Motivation: 生物大脑能够在有限的能量和资源预算下实现持续学习能力，而人工系统实现持续学习需要大量内存和计算资源，特别是在资源受限平台上部署时更为困难。

Method: 提出Genesis脉冲持续学习加速器架构，支持神经启发的活动依赖性元可塑性机制，集成低精度持续学习参数，采用定制数据移动策略处理稀疏分布的脉冲，并使用内存映射技术将元可塑性参数和突触权重放在同一地址位置以加速内存访问。

Conclusion: Genesis架构成功实现了高效的持续学习加速，在保持较低功耗的同时获得了良好的分类性能，为解决资源受限环境下的持续学习问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Continual learning, the ability to acquire and transfer knowledge through a
models lifetime, is critical for artificial agents that interact in real-world
environments. Biological brains inherently demonstrate these capabilities while
operating within limited energy and resource budgets. Achieving continual
learning capability in artificial systems considerably increases memory and
computational demands, and even more so when deploying on platforms with
limited resources. In this work, Genesis, a spiking continual learning
accelerator, is proposed to address this gap. The architecture supports
neurally inspired mechanisms, such as activity-dependent metaplasticity, to
alleviate catastrophic forgetting. It integrates low-precision continual
learning parametersand employs a custom data movement strategy to accommodate
the sparsely distributed spikes. Furthermore, the architecture features a
memory mapping technique that places metaplasticity parameters and synaptic
weights in a single address location for faster memory access. Results show
that the mean classification accuracy for Genesis is 74.6% on a task-agnostic
split-MNIST benchmark with power consumption of 17.08mW in a 65nm technology
node.

Abstract: Swarm intelligence algorithms have demonstrated remarkable success in solving
complex optimization problems across diverse domains. However, their widespread
adoption is often hindered by limited transparency in how algorithmic
components influence performance. This work presents a multi-faceted
investigation of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to further understand the
key role of different topologies for better interpretability and
explainability. To achieve this objective, we first develop a comprehensive
landscape characterization framework using Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA)
to quantify problem difficulty and identify critical features affecting the
optimization performance of PSO. Next, we conduct a rigorous empirical study
comparing three fundamental swarm communication architectures -- Ring, Star,
and Von Neumann topologies -- analysing their distinct impacts on
exploration-exploitation balance, convergence behaviour, and solution quality
and eventually develop an explainable benchmarking framework for PSO, to decode
how swarm topologies affects information flow, diversity, and convergence.
Based on this, a novel machine learning approach for automated algorithm
configuration is introduced for training predictive models on extensive Area
over the Convergence Curve (AOCC) data to recommend optimal settings based on
problem characteristics. Through systematic experimentation across twenty four
benchmark functions in multiple dimensions, we establish practical guidelines
for topology selection and parameter configuration. These findings advance the
development of more transparent and reliable swarm intelligence systems. The

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising for neuromorphic computing due
to their biological plausibility and energy efficiency. However, training
methods like Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) and Real Time Recurrent
Learning (RTRL) remain computationally intensive. This work introduces an
integer-only, online training algorithm using a mixed-precision approach to
improve efficiency and reduce memory usage by over 60%. The method replaces
floating-point operations with integer arithmetic to enable hardware-friendly
implementation. It generalizes to Convolutional and Recurrent SNNs (CSNNs,
RSNNs), showing versatility across architectures. Evaluations on MNIST and the
Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) dataset demonstrate that mixed-precision models
achieve accuracy comparable to or better than full-precision baselines using
16-bit shadow and 8- or 12-bit inference weights. Despite some limitations in
low-precision and deeper models, performance remains robust. In conclusion, the
proposed integer-only online learning algorithm presents an effective solution
for efficiently training SNNs, enabling deployment on resource-constrained

Motivation: 调查LLM基硅自动程序修复系统的安全风险，因为这些系统依赖不可信的用户输入，可能造成新的攻击面。

Method: 建立完整的威胁模型，生成51个恶意错误报告（从手动制作到全自动流程），并测试领先APR模型的弱点，评估修复前后的防御措施效果。

Result: 当前防御措施效果不佳：90%恶意报告成功触发攻击者期望的补丁，最佳修复前过滤器只拦截47%，修复后分析仅在58%情况下有效。

Conclusion: 提出了提高APR系统对抗恶意滥用的实践建议，并指明了可信自动修复未来研究的方向，展示了生成恶意输入与检测缓解方案之间的结构性不对称性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) - based Automated Program Repair (APR) systems are
increasingly integrated into modern software development workflows, offering
automated patches in response to natural language bug reports. However, this
reliance on untrusted user input introduces a novel and underexplored attack
surface. In this paper, we investigate the security risks posed by adversarial
bug reports -- realistic-looking issue submissions crafted to mislead APR
systems into producing insecure or harmful code changes. We develop a
comprehensive threat model and conduct an empirical study to evaluate the
vulnerability of state-of-the-art APR systems to such attacks. Our
demonstration comprises 51 adversarial bug reports generated across a spectrum
of strategies, from manual curation to fully automated pipelines. We test these
against leading APR model and assess both pre-repair defenses (e.g., LlamaGuard
variants, PromptGuard variants, Granite-Guardian, and custom LLM filters) and
post-repair detectors (GitHub Copilot, CodeQL). Our findings show that current
defenses are insufficient: 90\% of crafted bug reports triggered
attacker-aligned patches. The best pre-repair filter blocked only 47\%, while
post-repair analysis-often requiring human oversight-was effective in just 58\%
of cases. To support scalable security testing, we introduce a prototype
framework for automating the generation of adversarial bug reports. Our
analysis exposes a structural asymmetry: generating adversarial inputs is
inexpensive, while detecting or mitigating them remains costly and error-prone.
We conclude with practical recommendations for improving the robustness of APR
systems against adversarial misuse and highlight directions for future work on
trustworthy automated repair.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: REST API测试面临分布式系统复杂性、场景多样性和时间限制等挑战，穷尽测试不现实，导致未检测故障、高人工成本和有限测试覆盖率。

Method: 结合测试规范语言和大语言模型，通过提示工程技术和自动化流水线，从OpenAPI规范生成测试用例，评估不同LLM的性能。

Result: Claude 3.5 Sonnet、Deepseek R1、Qwen 2.5 32b和Sabia 3等模型能生成稳健且上下文连贯的测试，其中Claude 3.5 Sonnet在所有指标上表现最优。

Conclusion: 大语言模型基于API规范自动生成测试具有巨大潜力，Claude 3.5 Sonnet是目前最适合此任务的模型。

Abstract: The effective execution of tests for REST APIs remains a considerable
challenge for development teams, driven by the inherent complexity of
distributed systems, the multitude of possible scenarios, and the limited time
available for test design. Exhaustive testing of all input combinations is
impractical, often resulting in undetected failures, high manual effort, and
limited test coverage. To address these issues, we introduce RestTSLLM, an
approach that uses Test Specification Language (TSL) in conjunction with Large
Language Models (LLMs) to automate the generation of test cases for REST APIs.
The approach targets two core challenges: the creation of test scenarios and
the definition of appropriate input data. The proposed solution integrates
prompt engineering techniques with an automated pipeline to evaluate various
LLMs on their ability to generate tests from OpenAPI specifications. The
evaluation focused on metrics such as success rate, test coverage, and mutation
score, enabling a systematic comparison of model performance. The results
indicate that the best-performing LLMs - Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic),
Deepseek R1 (Deepseek), Qwen 2.5 32b (Alibaba), and Sabia 3 (Maritaca) -
consistently produced robust and contextually coherent REST API tests. Among
them, Claude 3.5 Sonnet outperformed all other models across every metric,
emerging in this study as the most suitable model for this task. These findings
highlight the potential of LLMs to automate the generation of tests based on
API specifications.

Result: 多策略HGT和Gemini 2.5 Pro模型均优于原始版本，相比当前最优方法HGNNLink，在12个开源项目中平均F1分数分别提升3.68%和8.84%。

Conclusion: 多策略集成能有效提升NL-PL追踪链接恢复任务的整体模型性能，证明了领域特定策略在弥合语义鸿沟方面的重要性。

Abstract: In the field of software traceability link recovery (TLR), textual similarity
has long been regarded as the core criterion. However, in tasks involving
natural language and programming language (NL-PL) artifacts, relying solely on
textual similarity is limited by their semantic gap. To this end, we conducted
a large-scale empirical evaluation across various types of TLR tasks, revealing
the limitations of textual similarity in NL-PL scenarios. To address these
limitations, we propose an approach that incorporates multiple domain-specific
auxiliary strategies, identified through empirical analysis, into two models:
the Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT) via edge types and the prompt-based
Gemini 2.5 Pro via additional input information. We then evaluated our approach
using the widely studied requirements-to-code TLR task, a representative case
of NL-PL TLR. Experimental results show that both the multi-strategy HGT and
Gemini 2.5 Pro models outperformed their original counterparts without strategy
integration. Furthermore, compared to the current state-of-the-art method
HGNNLink, the multi-strategy HGT and Gemini 2.5 Pro models achieved average
F1-score improvements of 3.68% and 8.84%, respectively, across twelve
open-source projects, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-strategy
integration in enhancing overall model performance for the requirements-code
TLR task.

Method: 将旧版和新版的序列功能图(SFC)转换为Petri网模型，使用基于符号路径等价的新题包含性检查算法验证模型包含关系

Result: 在80个实际OSCAT库案例中验证了框架的可扩展性和有效性，与verifAPS工具相比性能提升近4倍

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效验证PLC软件升级的正确性，为工业控制系统提供了可靠的验证手段

Abstract: Upgradation of Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) software is quite common
to accommodate evolving industrial requirements. Verifying the correctness of
such upgrades remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a
verification-based approach to ensure the correctness of the existing
functionality in the upgraded version of a PLC software. The method converts
the older and the newer versions of the sequential function chart (SFC) into
two Petri net models. We then verify whether one model is contained within
another, based on a novel containment checking algorithm grounded in symbolic
path equivalence. For this purpose, we have developed a home-grown Petri
net-based containment checker. Experimental evaluation on 80 real-world
benchmarks from the OSCAT library highlights the scalability and effectiveness
of the framework. We have compared our approach with verifAPS, a popular tool
used for software upgradation, and observed nearly 4x performance improvement.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: IoT Miner是一个从工业传感器数据自动生成高级事件日志的框架，通过四阶段流程（数据预处理、无监督聚类、LLM标注、日志构建）解决传感器数据缺乏结构化语义的问题，特别使用LLM基于聚类统计生成有意义的标签


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在采矿和制造等工业环境中，标准事件日志通常不可用，原始传感器数据缺乏结构化和语义信息，无法直接用于流程挖掘分析

Method: 四阶段管道：1) 数据预处理 2) 无监督聚类 3) 基于大型语言模型(LLM)的标注（使用领域特定提示）4) 事件日志构建。核心创新是利用LLM从聚类统计中生成有意义的活动标签

Result: 在装载-运输-卸载(LHD)采矿机械传感器数据上评估，提出新的相似性加权精度指标评估标注质量，结果显示更丰富的提示词能产生更准确一致的标签

Conclusion: 通过将AI与领域感知数据处理相结合，IoT Miner提供了一种可扩展且可解释的方法，能够在传统日志缺失的环境中从IoT数据生成事件日志，支持流程挖掘应用

Abstract: This paper presents IoT Miner, a novel framework for automatically creating
high-level event logs from raw industrial sensor data to support process
mining. In many real-world settings, such as mining or manufacturing, standard
event logs are unavailable, and sensor data lacks the structure and semantics
needed for analysis. IoT Miner addresses this gap using a four-stage pipeline:
data preprocessing, unsupervised clustering, large language model (LLM)-based
labeling, and event log construction. A key innovation is the use of LLMs to
generate meaningful activity labels from cluster statistics, guided by
domain-specific prompts. We evaluate the approach on sensor data from a
Load-Haul-Dump (LHD) mining machine and introduce a new metric,
Similarity-Weighted Accuracy, to assess labeling quality. Results show that
richer prompts lead to more accurate and consistent labels. By combining AI
with domain-aware data processing, IoT Miner offers a scalable and
interpretable method for generating event logs from IoT data, enabling process
mining in settings where traditional logs are missing.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: GeoAnalystBench基准测试显示，专有LLM在GIS任务自动化方面表现优异（95%有效性），而开源模型表现较差（48.5%有效性），空间推理任务仍是所有模型的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在GIS工作流自动化中的应用日益增长，需要对其实际能力进行严格评估，避免过早宣称完全自动化。

Method: 构建包含50个Python任务的GeoAnalystBench基准，每个任务都有最小可交付产品，通过工作流有效性、结构对齐、语义相似性和代码质量（CodeBLEU）进行评估。

Result: 专有模型（如ChatGPT-4o-mini）达到95%有效性和0.39 CodeBLEU，而开源模型（如DeepSeek-R1-7B）仅48.5%有效性和0.272 CodeBLEU。空间关系检测和最优选址等空间推理任务最具挑战性。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在GIS自动化方面既有潜力也有局限，需要人机协作框架来推进GeoAI研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have fueled growing interest
in automating geospatial analysis and GIS workflows, yet their actual
capabilities remain uncertain. In this work, we call for rigorous evaluation of
LLMs on well-defined geoprocessing tasks before making claims about full GIS
automation. To this end, we present GeoAnalystBench, a benchmark of 50
Python-based tasks derived from real-world geospatial problems and carefully
validated by GIS experts. Each task is paired with a minimum deliverable
product, and evaluation covers workflow validity, structural alignment,
semantic similarity, and code quality (CodeBLEU). Using this benchmark, we
assess both proprietary and open source models. Results reveal a clear gap:
proprietary models such as ChatGPT-4o-mini achieve high validity 95% and
stronger code alignment (CodeBLEU 0.39), while smaller open source models like
DeepSeek-R1-7B often generate incomplete or inconsistent workflows (48.5%
validity, 0.272 CodeBLEU). Tasks requiring deeper spatial reasoning, such as
spatial relationship detection or optimal site selection, remain the most
challenging across all models. These findings demonstrate both the promise and
limitations of current LLMs in GIS automation and provide a reproducible
framework to advance GeoAI research with human-in-the-loop support.

TL;DR: Code2MCP是一个自动化框架，能够将GitHub仓库转换为MCP兼容服务，解决LLM与工具集成的N×M问题，通过闭环调试机制自动修复生成代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型与工具集成时的N×M问题，即N个模型需要为M个工具定制集成，这种碎片化阻碍创新并增加开发负担。MCP标准虽好但手动转换现有软件成本高。

Method: 采用多阶段工作流自动化整个过程：代码分析、环境配置、服务生成和部署。核心创新是LLM驱动的闭环"运行-审查-修复"循环，能够自主调试和修复生成的代码。

Result: 框架不仅生成可部署的MCP服务，还提供全面的技术文档，系统性地解锁世界上最大的开源代码仓库GitHub，自动化工具集成的最后一公里。

Conclusion: Code2MCP作为催化剂加速MCP生态系统发展，通过高度自动化方式解决工具集成难题，代码已在GitHub开源。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created a significant
integration challenge in the AI agent ecosystem, often called the "$N \times M$
problem," where N models require custom integrations for M tools. This
fragmentation stifles innovation and creates substantial development overhead.
While the Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a standard to resolve
this, its adoption is hindered by the manual effort required to convert the
vast universe of existing software into MCP-compliant services. This is
especially true for the millions of open-source repositories on GitHub, the
world's largest collection of functional code. This paper introduces Code2MCP,
a highly automated, agentic framework designed to transform any GitHub
repository into a functional MCP service with minimal human intervention. Our
system employs a multi-stage workflow that automates the entire process, from
code analysis and environment configuration to service generation and
deployment. A key innovation of our framework is an LLM-driven, closed-loop
"Run--Review--Fix" cycle, which enables the system to autonomously debug and
repair the code it generates. Code2MCP produces not only deployable services
but also comprehensive technical documentation, acting as a catalyst to
accelerate the MCP ecosystem by systematically unlocking the world's largest
open-source code repository and automating the critical last mile of tool
integration. The code is open-sourced at

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: GRACE通过构建多级代码图结构和混合检索方法，显著提升了LLM在仓库级代码任务中的性能，超越了现有最先进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法在代码检索中过度依赖文本相似性，忽略了代码的结构关系（如调用链、继承层次），且检索到的代码片段以简单文本拼接方式输入LLM时会丢失关键结构信息。

Method: GRACE构建统一的多级多语义代码图，包含文件结构、AST、函数调用图、类层次结构和数据流图。采用混合图检索器结合图神经网络结构相似性和文本检索，并通过图注意力网络重排序。使用结构融合机制保留函数调用和继承等关键依赖关系。

Result: 在公共仓库级基准测试中，GRACE在所有指标上显著优于最先进方法。使用DeepSeek-V3作为骨干LLM，GRACE比最强的基于图的RAG基线在EM和ES指标上分别提升8.19%和7.51%。

Conclusion: GRACE通过整合代码的结构语义信息和创新的图检索方法，有效解决了LLM在仓库级代码任务中的上下文限制问题，为代码智能处理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: LLMs excel in localized code completion but struggle with repository-level
tasks due to limited context windows and complex semantic and structural
dependencies across codebases. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
mitigates context scarcity by retrieving relevant code snippets, current
approaches face significant limitations. They overly rely on textual similarity
for retrieval, neglecting structural relationships such as call chains and
inheritance hierarchies, and lose critical structural information by naively
concatenating retrieved snippets into text sequences for LLM input. To address
these shortcomings, GRACE constructs a multi-level, multi-semantic code graph
that unifies file structures, abstract syntax trees, function call graphs,
class hierarchies, and data flow graphs to capture both static and dynamic code
semantics. For retrieval, GRACE employs a Hybrid Graph Retriever that
integrates graph neural network-based structural similarity with textual
retrieval, refined by a graph attention network-based re-ranker to prioritize
topologically relevant subgraphs. To enhance context, GRACE introduces a
structural fusion mechanism that merges retrieved subgraphs with the local code
context and preserves essential dependencies like function calls and
inheritance. Extensive experiments on public repository-level benchmarks
demonstrate that GRACE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across all metrics. Using DeepSeek-V3 as the backbone LLM, GRACE surpasses the
strongest graph-based RAG baselines by 8.19% EM and 7.51% ES points on every
dataset. The code is available at

Motivation: 评估大语言模型在需求工程教育中的影响，提高学生参与度和动机，为其提供实用工具支持未来职业发展

Method: 在两所大学的两门需求工程课程中，通过个人作业和团队基础的演进项目两种教学形式集成LLMs，收集了179名学生的调查数据

Result: LLMs提高了学生对需求概念的理解，特别是在需求获取和文档化任务中；个人作业比团队作业效果更好；学生担心学术成信、过度依赖AI等问题

Conclusion: 需要在需求工程教育中有效集成LLMs，平衡AI辅助学习与承负思维、协作实践的关系，并提出了相关建议和未来研究方向

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Requirements Engineering
(RE) education is reshaping pedagogical approaches, seeking to enhance student
engagement and motivation while providing practical tools to support their
professional future. This study empirically evaluates the impact of integrating
LLMs in RE coursework. We examined how the guided use of LLMs influenced
students' learning experiences, and what benefits and challenges they perceived
in using LLMs in RE practices. The study collected survey data from 179
students across two RE courses in two universities. LLMs were integrated into
coursework through different instructional formats, i.e., individual
assignments versus a team-based Agile project. Our findings indicate that LLMs
improved students' comprehension of RE concepts, particularly in tasks like
requirements elicitation and documentation. However, students raised concerns
about LLMs in education, including academic integrity, overreliance on AI, and
challenges in integrating AI-generated content into assignments. Students who
worked on individual assignments perceived that they benefited more than those
who worked on team-based assignments, highlighting the importance of contextual
AI integration. This study offers recommendations for the effective integration
of LLMs in RE education. It proposes future research directions for balancing
AI-assisted learning with critical thinking and collaborative practices in RE
courses.

Motivation: 出于个人困惑、同行评审意见以及现有文献中存在的明显混乱，需要对法律要求概念进行系统性分析。

Method: 采用快速审查方法，对需求工程领域关于法律要求的研究文献进行综合分析。

Result: 发现存在规范性理解但缺乏正确定义和概念操作化；法律要求被视为模糊复杂、需要大量工作量；存在知识空白、频繁变化、重叠等问题；实施希望不高。

Conclusion: 批判性指出领域内存在明显的知识空白，缺乏实证证据支撑观察结论，且概念混乱仍然持续。

Abstract: Out of a personal puzzlement, recent peer review comments, and demonstrable
confusion in the existing literature, the paper presents a rapid review of the
concept of legal requirements (LRs) in requirements engineering (RE) research.
According to reviewing results, a normative understanding of LRs has often been
present, although proper definitions and conceptual operationalizations are
lacking. Some papers also see LRs as functional and others as non-functional
requirements. Legal requirements are often characterized as being vague and
complex, requiring a lot of effort to elicit, implement, and validate. These
characterizations supposedly correlate with knowledge gaps among requirements
engineers. LRs are also seen to often change and overlap. They may be also
prioritized. According to the literature, they seem to be also reluctantly
implemented, often providing only a minimal baseline for other requirements.
With these and other observations, the review raises critical arguments about
apparent knowledge gaps, including a lack of empirical evidence backing the
observations and enduring conceptual confusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的学习基于SPD方法通常只能处理源代码，而无法应用于发布二进制文件的闭源软件和专有系统，存在重要的研究空白。

Method: 构建了19,448个样本的大规模二进制补丁数据集（汇编代码和伪代码两种表示），系统评估19个不同规模的代码LLM，并通过精调策略注入二进制SPD领域知识。

Result: 直接提示普通代码LLM无法准确识别安全补丁，而精调后的LLM在伪代码表示上取得了最佳性能，显示出艰出的补丁检测能力。

Conclusion: 代码LLM通过适当的精调和表示方式可以有效处理二进制安全补丁检测任务，为闭源软件安全维护提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Security patch detection (SPD) is crucial for maintaining software security,
as unpatched vulnerabilities can lead to severe security risks. In recent
years, numerous learning-based SPD approaches have demonstrated promising
results on source code. However, these approaches typically cannot be applied
to closed-source applications and proprietary systems that constitute a
significant portion of real-world software, as they release patches only with
binary files, and the source code is inaccessible. Given the impressive
performance of code large language models (LLMs) in code intelligence and
binary analysis tasks such as decompilation and compilation optimization, their
potential for detecting binary security patches remains unexplored, exposing a
significant research gap between their demonstrated low-level code
understanding capabilities and this critical security task. To address this
gap, we construct a large-scale binary patch dataset containing \textbf{19,448}
samples, with two levels of representation: assembly code and pseudo-code, and
systematically evaluate \textbf{19} code LLMs of varying scales to investigate
their capability in binary SPD tasks. Our initial exploration demonstrates that
directly prompting vanilla code LLMs struggles to accurately identify security
patches from binary patches, and even state-of-the-art prompting techniques
fail to mitigate the lack of domain knowledge in binary SPD within vanilla
models. Drawing on the initial findings, we further investigate the fine-tuning
strategy for injecting binary SPD domain knowledge into code LLMs through two
levels of representation. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs
achieve outstanding performance, with the best results obtained on the
pseudo-code representation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练模型作为新型软件依赖（Software Dependencies 2.0）的广泛应用对软件系统的可维护性和可靠性构成潜在威胁，需要了解开发者如何管理和集成这些模型依赖。

Method: 采用混合方法分析，从PeaTMOSS数据集的28,575个仓库中随机抽样401个GitHub仓库，定量分析PTM重用模式，定性研究开发者实际集成和管理模型的方式。

Result: 研究发现开源项目中PTM依赖的结构化方式、文档化程度，识别了PTM重用管道中的不同阶段和组织模式，以及PTM与其他学习组件在管道阶段的交互关系。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了预训练模型作为新型软件依赖在开源项目中的实际集成情况，为理解和管理Software Dependencies 2.0提供了重要见解，有助于提高依赖PTM的软件系统的可维护性和可靠性。

Abstract: Pre-trained models (PTMs) are machine learning models that have been trained
in advance, often on large-scale data, and can be reused for new tasks, thereby
reducing the need for costly training from scratch. Their widespread adoption
introduces a new class of software dependency, which we term Software
Dependencies 2.0, extending beyond conventional libraries to learned behaviors
embodied in trained models and their associated artifacts. The integration of
PTMs as software dependencies in real projects remains unclear, potentially
threatening maintainability and reliability of modern software systems that
increasingly rely on them. Objective: In this study, we investigate Software
Dependencies 2.0 in open-source software (OSS) projects by examining the reuse
of PTMs, with a focus on how developers manage and integrate these models.
Specifically, we seek to understand: (1) how OSS projects structure and
document their PTM dependencies; (2) what stages and organizational patterns
emerge in the reuse pipelines of PTMs within these projects; and (3) the
interactions among PTMs and other learned components across pipeline stages. We
conduct a mixed-methods analysis of a statistically significant random sample
of 401 GitHub repositories from the PeaTMOSS dataset (28,575 repositories
reusing PTMs from Hugging Face and PyTorch Hub). We quantitatively examine PTM
reuse by identifying patterns and qualitatively investigate how developers
integrate and manage these models in practice.

Abstract: Agentic Software Engineering (SE 3.0) represents a new era where intelligent
agents are tasked not with simple code generation, but with achieving complex,
goal-oriented SE objectives. To harness these new capabilities while ensuring
trustworthiness, we must recognize a fundamental duality within the SE field in
the Agentic SE era, comprising two symbiotic modalities: SE for Humans and SE
for Agents. This duality demands a radical reimagining of the foundational
pillars of SE (actors, processes, tools, and artifacts) which manifest
differently across each modality. We propose two purpose-built workbenches to
support this vision. The Agent Command Environment (ACE) serves as a command
center where humans orchestrate and mentor agent teams, handling outputs such
as Merge-Readiness Packs (MRPs) and Consultation Request Packs (CRPs). The
Agent Execution Environment (AEE) is a digital workspace where agents perform
tasks while invoking human expertise when facing ambiguity or complex
trade-offs. This bi-directional partnership, which supports agent-initiated
human callbacks and handovers, gives rise to new, structured engineering
activities (i.e., processes) that redefine human-AI collaboration, elevating
the practice from agentic coding to true agentic software engineering. This
paper presents the Structured Agentic Software Engineering (SASE) vision,
outlining several of the foundational pillars for the future of SE. The paper
culminates in a research roadmap that identifies a few key challenges and
opportunities while briefly discussing the resulting impact of this future on
SE education. Our goal is not to offer a definitive solution, but to provide a
conceptual scaffold with structured vocabulary to catalyze a community-wide
dialogue, pushing the SE community to think beyond its classic, human-centric
tenets toward a disciplined, scalable, and trustworthy agentic future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件失败可能造成严重后果，但组织在进行失败后处理时的有效性和采用度差异很大。需要深入了解工程师如何收集、文档化、分享和应用失败教训，以改善可靠性和防止重复失败。

Method: 采用案例研究方法，通过对国家航天研究中心10位研究软件工程师进行深度访谈，并包括来自其他高可靠性组织的5个访谈数据以评估可转移性。

Result: 研究发现：(1)失败学习通常是非正式、随机的，并不一致地集成到软件开发生命周期中；(2)缺乏结构化过程导致重复失败持续发生；(3)时间约束、人员替换造成的知识丢失、文档分散和过程执行弱缺等关键挑战娱制了系统性学习。

Conclusion: 研究深化了对软件工程师如何从失败中学习的理解，为改善失败管理实践提供了指导，并强调了建立结构化失败学习过程的重要性。

Abstract: Software failures can have significant consequences, making learning from
failures a critical aspect of software engineering. While software
organizations are recommended to conduct postmortems, the effectiveness and
adoption of these practices vary widely. Understanding how engineers gather,
document, share, and apply lessons from failures is essential for improving
reliability and preventing recurrence. High-reliability organizations (HROs)
often develop software systems where failures carry catastrophic risks,
requiring continuous learning to ensure reliability. These organizations
provide a valuable setting to examine practices and challenges for learning
from software failures. Such insight could help develop processes and tools to
improve reliability and prevent recurrence. However, we lack in-depth industry
perspectives on the practices and challenges of learning from failures.
  To address this gap, we conducted a case study through 10 in-depth interviews
with research software engineers at a national space research center. We
examine how they learn from failures: how they gather, document, share, and
apply lessons. To assess transferability, we include data from 5 additional
interviews at other HROs. Our findings provide insight into how engineers learn
from failures in practice. To summarize: (1) failure learning is informal, ad
hoc, and inconsistently integrated into SDLC; (2) recurring failures persist
due to absence of structured processes; and (3) key challenges, including time
constraints, knowledge loss from turnover and fragmented documentation, and
weak process enforcement, undermine systematic learning. Our findings deepen
understanding of how software engineers learn from failures and offer guidance
for improving failure management practices.

Result: 在1,463个GitHub项目的290,133个单元测试中，发现：(i)Java的默认监控算法对Python并非最快；(ii)PyMOP比两个最新动态分析系统快达1,168.3倍；(iii)PyMOP发现的121个bug中有44个已被开发者修复。

Conclusion: PyMOP的通用性和高效性使其成为Python运行时验证领域的优秀平台，为后续研究奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Runtime verification (RV) now scales for testing thousands of open-source
Java projects, helping find hundreds of bugs. The popular Python ecosystem
could use such benefits. But, today's Python RV systems are limited to a domain
or specification logic, or slow. We propose PyMOP, a generic, extensible, and
efficient RV system for Python. PyMOP supports five logics, implements five
existing monitoring algorithms, ships with 73 API specs of Python and
widely-used libraries, supports three instrumentation strategies, and users can
easily add more of these. On 290,133 unit tests in 1,463 GitHub projects, we
find mainly that (i) the default monitoring algorithm for Java is often not the
fastest for Python; (ii) PyMOP is up to 1,168.3x faster than two recent dynamic
analysis systems; and (iii) 44 of 121 bugs that PyMOP helped find so far were
fixed by developers. PyMOP's generality and efficiency position it well as an
excellent platform for the next advances on RV for Python.

### [409] [Analyzing the Instability of Large Language Models in Automated Bug Injection and Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06429)
*Mehmet Bilal Er,Nagehan İlhan,Umut Kuran*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了ChatGPT在代码错误修复任务中的输出不稳定性，发现随着温度设置的提高，模型的结构性和功能性不稳定性显著增加，高温度下功能失败率特别高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在软件工程任务中应用日益增长，但这些模型经常产生不稳定的结果，在代码生成任务中已经讨论过这种不稳定性，但在错误修复任务中的一致性还未得到全面评估。本研究旨在探索ChatGPT等LLM在代码错误修复中的不稳定性程度。

Method: 研究使用不同错误类型的代码样本，在不同温度设置（0、0.5和1）下获取多个修复建议，对每个问题生成9个不同输出进行比较。采用语法相似性和输出等价率（OER）指标来评估输出的结构性和功能性一致性。

Result: 实验结果显示，随着温度的提高，模型的输出变得更加不稳定和多样化，高温度下显示出特别高的功能失败率。语法相似性分析显示，在低温度下建议的修复方案相对类似，而在高温度下显示出显著的结构差异。

Conclusion: 这项研究为如何更一致地应用基于LLM的错误修正系统提供了重要的方法论见解，同时也对这些系统的可靠性提出了疑问。

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software engineering tasks is
growing, especially in the areas of bug fixing and code generation.
Nevertheless, these models often yield unstable results; when executed at
different times with the same input, they can generate radically different
code. The consistency of LLMs in bug-fixing tasks has not yet been thoroughly
assessed, despite the fact that this instability has typically been discussed
in the literature in relation to code generation. The purpose of this study is
to look into how unstable an LLM like ChatGPT is when it comes to fixing code
bugs. We examine the structural, syntactic, and functional variations among
several fix recommendations made in response to the same prompt using code
samples with various error types. Additionally, we assess how instability is
affected by the temperature settings (0, 0.5, and 1) used for the model's
deterministic operation. For a total of 20 problems in the experimental
analysis, the model produced three fix suggestions at each temperature value,
comparing nine distinct outputs for each problem. The Syntax Similarity and
Output Equivalence Rate (OER) metrics were used to assess the outputs'
structural and functional consistency. The results demonstrate that the model's
outputs become much more unstable and variable as the temperature rises, with
high temperatures showing especially high rates of functional failure.
According to syntax similarity analyses, the suggested fixes show notable
structural differences at high temperatures but are fairly similar at low
temperatures. The purpose of this study is to provide important methodological
insights into how LLM-based error correction systems can be applied more
consistently in software development processes while also casting doubt on
their dependability.

TL;DR: 提出了Design Multiverse概念，用于在建模空间中管理设计路径的演变和分支，支持多利益相关者协同设计复杂系统时的版本变体管理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实设计过程中存在多个设计路径的演变和分支（通过分支、修订、合并等），特别是当多个利益相关者或团队并发操作和/或探索复杂异构系统的不同替代方案时。当前建模空间无法直接管理这种时空变异性，需要借助外部工具和方法。

Method: 引入Design Multiverse概念，在建模空间中集成选定修订版本和变体，表示由多个工件组成的设计状态快照。提出基于模型联邦范式的实现方案。

Result: 提出了Design Multiverse的概念定义，讨论了模型产品线和模型/元模型协同进化等使用场景，并提出了具体实现方法。

Conclusion: Design Multiverse能够使利益相关者无缝追踪、分析和管理设计决策、系统变体及其相互依赖关系，解决了当前建模工具无法有效管理设计路径演变的问题。

Abstract: Real-world design processes often involve the evolution and divergence of
design paths (by branching, revising, merging, etc.), especially when multiple
stakeholders or teams operate concurrently and/or explore different
alternatives for complex and heterogeneous systems. Unfortunately, this
variability in time and space can not be directly managed in current modeling
spaces but requires resorting to external tools and methodologies.
  In order to tackle this problem, we introduce the Design Multiverse. The
Design Multiverse aims to integrate in the modeling space a selection of
revisions and variants, representing snapshots of a design state composed of
multiple artifacts. This enables stakeholders to seamlessly trace, analyze, and
manage design decisions, system variants, and their interdependencies.
Concretely, in this paper we present a conceptual definition of the Design
Multiverse, discuss usage scenarios such as model product lines and
model/metamodel co-evolution, and propose an implementation leveraging the
model federation paradigm.

TL;DR: 提出BISS方法，通过测试套件优化技术减少基准测试的计算成本，同时保持变体排名的稳定性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基准测试在软件工程中用于评估软件变体的质量和性能，但完整的基准测试执行需要大量计算资源和时间

Method: BISection Sampling (BISS)方法，战略性保留最关键测试并应用分治方法在相关剩余测试中进行高效采样

Result: 将基准测试的计算成本平均降低到44%，超过一半的基准测试可减少高达99%的成本，且不损失排名稳定性

Conclusion: BISS方法在LLM排行榜、SAT竞赛和可配置系统等多个用例中表现优于基线方法，能显著减少基准测试成本

Abstract: Benchmarking is a common practice in software engineering to assess the
qualities and performance of software variants, coming from multiple competing
systems or from configurations of the same system. Benchmarks are used notably
to compare and understand variant performance, fine-tune software, detect
regressions, or design new software systems. The execution of benchmarks to get
a complete picture of software variants is highly costly in terms of
computational resources and time. In this paper, we propose a novel approach
for reducing benchmarks while maintaining stable rankings, using test suite
optimization techniques. That is, we remove instances from the benchmarks while
trying to keep the same rankings of the variants on all tests. Our method,
BISection Sampling, BISS, strategically retains the most critical tests and
applies a novel divide-and-conquer approach to efficiently sample among
relevant remaining tests. We experiment with datasets and use cases from LLM
leaderboards, SAT competitions, and configurable systems for performance
modeling. Our results show that our method outperforms baselines even when
operating on a subset of variants. Using BISS, we reduce the computational cost
of the benchmarks on average to 44% and on more than half the benchmarks by up
to 99% without loss in ranking stability.

Motivation: 在LLM时代，虽然LLM能帮助问题设置者生成多样化问题，但也会破坏评估的完整性，因为解决者可以轻易获取解决方案。需要一种既能帮助设置者创建有意义评估，又能帮助解决者准备时间限制和陌生问题的平台。

Method: 开发OpenCoderRank平台，作为问题设置者和解决者之间的桥梁，支持自托管评估，提供无成本和可定制的技术评估解决方案。

Result: 创建了一个易于使用的平台，能够模拟技术评估，帮助解决者准备时间约束和陌生问题，同时允许设置者自托管评估。

Conclusion: OpenCoderRank为资源受限环境提供了有效的技术评估解决方案，既保持了评估的完整性，又提供了灵活性和可定制性。

Abstract: Organizations and educational institutions use time-bound assessment tasks to
evaluate coding and problem-solving skills. These assessments measure not only
the correctness of the solutions, but also their efficiency. Problem setters
(educator/interviewer) are responsible for crafting these challenges, carefully
balancing difficulty and relevance to create meaningful evaluation experiences.
Conversely, problem solvers (student/interviewee) apply coding efficiency and
logical thinking to arrive at correct solutions. In the era of Large Language
Models (LLMs), LLMs assist problem setters in generating diverse and
challenging questions, but they can undermine assessment integrity for problem
solvers by providing easy access to solutions. This paper introduces
OpenCoderRank, an easy-to-use platform designed to simulate technical
assessments. It acts as a bridge between problem setters and problem solvers,
helping solvers prepare for time constraints and unfamiliar problems while
allowing setters to self-host assessments, offering a no-cost and customizable
solution for technical assessments in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: HyGLAD是一种新颖的算法，通过构建可解释的模式来检测事件数据中的异常，在性能和效率上都优于现有的深度学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在静态系统中检测事件异常，任何与过去行为的偏离都可能表示恶意活动。现有深度学习方法缺乏可解释性，需要开发既高效又可解释的异常检测方法。

Method: 算法推断具有相似行为的实体等价类，然后构建捕获这些实体值的正则表达式。这些正则表达式直接可解释，从而产生可解释的异常。

Result: 在5个真实系统数据集上评估，平均性能优于所有7种DeepOD的无监督方法。训练和推理效率提高一个数量级（单CPU vs GPU），精确度提高1.2倍，召回率提高1.3倍。

Conclusion: HyGLAD在保持可解释性的同时，在异常检测性能和计算效率方面都显著优于现有的深度学习方法，为事件异常检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose HyGLAD, a novel algorithm that automatically builds a set of
interpretable patterns that model event data. These patterns can then be used
to detect event-based anomalies in a stationary system, where any deviation
from past behavior may indicate malicious activity. The algorithm infers
equivalence classes of entities with similar behavior observed from the events,
and then builds regular expressions that capture the values of those entities.
As opposed to deep-learning approaches, the regular expressions are directly
interpretable, which also translates to interpretable anomalies. We evaluate
HyGLAD against all 7 unsupervised anomaly detection methods from DeepOD on five
datasets from real-world systems. The experimental results show that on average
HyGLAD outperforms existing deep-learning methods while being an order of
magnitude more efficient in training and inference (single CPU vs GPU).
Precision improved by 1.2x and recall by 1.3x compared to the second-best
baseline.

descriptive texts using image-to-text models. Our approach ensures a robust
semantic connection between modalities, enhancing the utility of the created
datasets for various applications. We also discuss the challenges encountered
and propose solutions to improve data quality. The resulting datasets, publicly
available, aim to support and advance research in multimodal data analysis and
machine learning.

TL;DR: 这篇论文探讨了如何利用APT攻击者的认知弱点，通过认知契约策略和防御欺证机制来获得战略优势，实现至少40%的效果提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类决策存在认知弱点，包括认知能力差异和认知偏见。利用这些弱点，认知明感的实体可以获得战略优势（认知契约）。本文研究如何利用APT攻击者的认知弱点来建立认知意识防御。

Method: 提出了双层次网络战争游戏模型，重点关注"战略层面"的防御欺证机制设计，从而支撑"作战层面"的行动和战术技术执行。采用游戏理论进行跨级别的定量模型和认知契约策略设计。

Result: 数值结果显示，虽然防御方的初始优势随时间消逐，但策略性时机和部署的欺证技术可以在规划阶段将攻击者的负面价值转为正面价值，并在执行阶段实现至少40%的总佣励提升。

Conclusion: 防御方可以放大甚至小的初始优势，持续保持对攻击者的战略优势，并且能够在攻击者的全生命周期内保护关键资产。

Abstract: Cognitive vulnerabilities shape human decision-making and arise primarily
from two sources: (1) cognitive capabilities, which include disparities in
knowledge, education, expertise, or access to information, and (2) cognitive
biases, such as rational inattention, confirmation bias, and base rate neglect,
which influence how individuals perceive and process information. Exploiting
these vulnerabilities allows an entity with superior cognitive awareness to
gain a strategic advantage, a concept referred to as cognitive arbitrage. This
paper investigates how to exploit the cognitive vulnerabilities of Advanced
Persistent Threat (APT) attackers and proposes cognition-aware defenses that
leverage windows of superiority to counteract attacks. Specifically, the
proposed bi-level cyber warfare game focuses on "strategic-level" design for
defensive deception mechanisms, which then facilitates "operational-level"
actions and tactical-level execution of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures
(TTPs). Game-theoretic reasoning and analysis play a significant role in the
cross-echelon quantitative modeling and design of cognitive arbitrage
strategies. Our numerical results demonstrate that although the defender's
initial advantage diminishes over time, strategically timed and deployed
deception techniques can turn a negative value for the attacker into a positive
one during the planning phase, and achieve at least a 40% improvement in total
rewards during execution. This demonstrates that the defender can amplify even
small initial advantages, sustain a strategic edge over the attacker, and
secure long-term objectives, such as protecting critical assets throughout the
attacker's lifecycle.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Knapsack Contracts问题，将经典随机背包问题与合约设计相结合，研究在代理策略性努力控制随机处理时间情况下的算法设计与近似保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合随机优化和合约设计中的随机性，研究当优化问题中的随机性由策略性努力控制时产生的计算挑战，特别是在激励代理执行具有随机处理时间任务的情景。

Method: 将Knapsack Contracts问题建模为带成本和多重选择的随机背包问题，引入投资回报率倒数(IOR)作为关键参数，开发不依赖自适应性的近似算法。

Result: 对于IOR值为α的情况，开发了O(α)近似算法，建立了匹配的Ω(α)下界，证明了IOR在理解问题复杂性和近似性方面的基础性作用。

Conclusion: IOR参数对于实现非平凡近似保证既是必要的也是充分的，该研究揭示了当优化问题中的随机性由策略性努力控制时产生的计算挑战。

Abstract: We formulate the Knapsack Contracts problem -- a strategic version of the
classic Stochastic Knapsack problem, which builds upon the inherent randomness
shared by stochastic optimization and contract design. In this problem, the
principal incentivizes agents to perform jobs with stochastic processing times,
the realization of which depends on the agents' efforts.
  Algorithmically, we show that Knapsack Contracts can be viewed as Stochastic
Knapsack with costs and multi-choice, features that introduce significant new
challenges. We identify a crucial and economically meaningful parameter -- the
Return on Investment (ROI) value. We show that the Inverse of ROI (or IOR for
short) precisely characterizes the extent to which the approximation guarantees
for Stochastic Knapsack extend to its strategic counterpart.
  For IOR of $\alpha$, we develop an algorithm that finds an
$O(\alpha)$-approximation policy that does not rely on adaptivity. We establish
matching $\Omega(\alpha)$ lower bounds, both on the adaptivity gap, and on what
can be achieved without full distributional knowledge of the processing times.
Taken together, our results show that IOR is fundamental to understanding the
complexity and approximability of Knapsack Contracts, and bounding it is both
necessary and sufficient for achieving non-trivial approximation guarantees.
Our results highlight the computational challenges arising when stochasticity
in optimization problems is controlled by strategic effort.

Conclusion: 钥匙链问题提供了一个统一的框架来研究序列决策中的探索-利用权衡，提出的算法和连接技术具有通用性，可应用于其他相关领域。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a family of sequential decision-making problems,
collectively called the Keychain Problem, that involve exploring a set of
actions to maximize expected payoff when only a subset of actions are available
in each stage. In an instance of the Keychain Problem, a locksmith faces a
sequence of choices, each of which involves selecting one key from a specified
subset (a keychain) to attempt to open a lock. Given a Bayesian prior on the
effectiveness of keys, the locksmith's goal is to maximize the expected number
of rounds in which the lock is opened -- or equivalently, minimize the
opportunity cost which is the expected number of rounds in which the chain has
a correct key but our selected key is incorrect. We investigate Keychain
Problems under three assumptions on the order in which keychains are tested by
the locksmith: a fixed, known order; a random order sampled from a known
distribution on a set of ``scenarios''; or an order selected by the locksmith
themself. We present an exact algorithm for the simplest of these settings, and
we present approximation algorithms and hardness results for the others. In the
Probabilistic Scenarios setting, our approximation algorithm is based on a
novel connection between combinatorial auctions and policy design for
sequential decision-making problems. To illustrate the generality of this
technique, we apply the same ideas to obtain Philosopher Inequalities for
Online Bipartite Matching and some of its extensions.

Motivation: 解决互补推荐中行为标签噪声大和功能标签标注成本高的两难问题，需要一种低成本获取高质量标签的方法。

Method: 提出KARL框架，融合主动学习和大型语言模型，选择性采样分类器最困难的数据点，利用LLM进行标签扩展。

Result: 在OOD设置下准确率提升高达37%，在ID设置下改进小于0.5%，长时间学习可能降低准确率。

Conclusion: KARL通过知识扩展增加数据多样性，需要根据预测上下文（ID或OOD）动态调整采样策略的多样性。

Abstract: Complementary recommendations play a crucial role in e-commerce by enhancing
user experience through suggestions of compatible items. Accurate
classification of complementary item relationships requires reliable labels,
but their creation presents a dilemma. Behavior-based labels are widely used
because they can be easily generated from interaction logs; however, they often
contain significant noise and lack reliability. While function-based labels
(FBLs) provide high-quality definitions of complementary relationships by
carefully articulating them based on item functions, their reliance on costly
manual annotation severely limits a model's ability to generalize to diverse
items. To resolve this trade-off, we propose Knowledge-Augmented Relation
Learning (KARL), a framework that strategically fuses active learning with
large language models (LLMs). KARL efficiently expands a high-quality FBL
dataset at a low cost by selectively sampling data points that the classifier
finds the most difficult and uses the label extension of the LLM. Our
experiments showed that in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, an unexplored
item feature space, KARL improved the baseline accuracy by up to 37%. In
contrast, in in-distribution (ID) settings, the learned item feature space, the
improvement was less than 0.5%, with prolonged learning could degrade accuracy.
These contrasting results are due to the data diversity driven by KARL's
knowledge expansion, suggesting the need for a dynamic sampling strategy that
adjusts diversity based on the prediction context (ID or OOD).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电商搜索中用户查询往往模糊简短且未充分指定，导致检索系统难以准确匹配结构化产品目录。现有方法无法捕捉细微用户意图，经常违反平台约束，且难以在生产环境中扩展

Method: 提出LESER框架，通过搜索引擎实时反馈作为监督来微调上下文感知LLM，使用组相对策略优化直接从相关性和覆盖度指标中学习，将查询扩展制定为检索优化任务

Result: 在大规模真实电商数据集上的评估显示，LESER在线下和线上设置中都取得了显著改进，不仅提升了语义覆盖和检索相关性，还带来了可衡量的用户参与度增益

Conclusion: LESER是现代搜索系统的一个实用且可扩展的解决方案，能够产生符合平台规则和检索目标的高质量查询扩展

Abstract: User queries in e-commerce search are often vague, short, and underspecified,
making it difficult for retrieval systems to match them accurately against
structured product catalogs. This challenge is amplified by the one-to-many
nature of user intent, where a single query can imply diverse and competing
needs. Existing methods, including neural query expansion and prompting-based
LLM approaches, fall short in real-world settings: they struggle to capture
nuanced user intent, often generate outputs that violate platform constraints,
and rely on workflows that are difficult to scale in production. We propose
Learning to Expand via Search Engine-feedback Reinforcement (LESER), a novel
framework that fine-tunes a context-aware LLM using real-time search engine
feedback as supervision. LESER formulates query expansion as a retrieval
optimization task and leverages Group Relative Policy Optimization to learn
directly from relevance and coverage metrics. LESER is trained to reason over
search results and produce high quality query expansions that align with
platform rules and retrieval objectives. We evaluate LESER on large-scale,
real-world e-commerce datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements in both
offline and online settings. Our results show that LESER not only enhances
semantic coverage and retrieval relevance but also delivers measurable gains in
user engagement, making it a practical and scalable solution for modern search
systems.

Conclusion: 需要开发更复杂的数据适配种子选择和多样化策略，这是未来的重要研究方向。

Abstract: Vector data is prevalent across business and scientific applications, and its
popularity is growing with the proliferation of learned embeddings. Vector data
collections often reach billions of vectors with thousands of dimensions, thus,
increasing the complexity of their analysis. Vector search is the backbone of
many critical analytical tasks, and graph-based methods have become the best
choice for analytical tasks that do not require guarantees on the quality of
the answers. Although several paradigms (seed selection, incremental insertion,
neighborhood propagation, neighborhood diversification, and divide-and-conquer)
have been employed to design in-memory graph-based vector search algorithms, a
systematic comparison of the key algorithmic advances is still missing. We
conduct an exhaustive experimental evaluation of twelve state-of-the-art
methods on seven real data collections, with sizes up to 1 billion vectors. We
share key insights about the strengths and limitations of these methods; e.g.,
the best approaches are typically based on incremental insertion and
neighborhood diversification, and the choice of the base graph can hurt
scalability. Finally, we discuss open research directions, such as the
importance of devising more sophisticated data adaptive seed selection and
diversification strategies.

Abstract: Recommender systems have generated tremendous value for both users and
businesses, drawing significant attention from academia and industry alike.
However, due to practical constraints, academic research remains largely
confined to offline dataset optimizations, lacking access to real user data and
large-scale recommendation platforms. This limitation reduces practical
relevance, slows technological progress, and hampers a full understanding of
the key challenges in recommender systems. In this survey, we provide a
systematic review of industrial recommender systems and contrast them with
their academic counterparts. We highlight key differences in data scale,
real-time requirements, and evaluation methodologies, and we summarize major
real-world recommendation scenarios along with their associated challenges. We
then examine how industry practitioners address these challenges in
Transaction-Oriented Recommender Systems and Content-Oriented Recommender
Systems, a new classification grounded in item characteristics and
recommendation objectives. Finally, we outline promising research directions,
including the often-overlooked role of user decision-making, the integration of
economic and psychological theories, and concrete suggestions for advancing
academic research. Our goal is to enhance academia's understanding of practical
recommender systems, bridge the growing development gap, and foster stronger
collaboration between industry and academia.

Motivation: 解决对话推荐系统中探索（澄清用户需求）和利用（直接推荐）的平衡问题，特别是在大语言模型处理海量商品目录时的挑战

Method: 使用神经检索器获取相关商品，计算重排序分数的熵值来动态路由对话策略：低熵（明确）查询触发直接推荐，高熵（模糊）查询触发探索性问题

Result: 该方法简单有效，使LLM驱动的智能体能够实时感知任意大规模商品目录，而不会增加上下文窗口负担

Conclusion: 基于检索分数分布熵的动态路由策略为对话推荐系统提供了一种有效的探索-利用平衡机制

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems promise rich interactions for e-commerce,
but balancing exploration (clarifying user needs) and exploitation (making
recommendations) remains challenging, especially when deploying large language
models (LLMs) with vast product catalogs. We address this challenge by modeling
the breadth of user interest via the entropy of retrieval score distributions.
Our method uses a neural retriever to fetch relevant items for a user query and
computes the entropy of the re-ranked scores to dynamically route the dialogue
policy: low-entropy (specific) queries trigger direct recommendations, whereas
high-entropy (ambiguous) queries prompt exploratory questions. This simple yet
effective strategy allows an LLM-driven agent to remain aware of an arbitrarily
large catalog in real-time without bloating its context window.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保不同语言用户在信息检索中获得公平的结果，相同语义的查询在不同语言下应该返回相似的排序结果

Method: 使用传统检索方法和基于mBERT/XLM-R的DPR神经排序器评估公平性，并提出LaKDA损失函数来减少语言偏见

Result: 分析揭示了当前MLIR技术中存在内在语言偏见，不同检索方法间存在显著差异，LaKDA在提升语言公平性方面表现有效

Conclusion: LaKDA损失函数是解决跨语言信息检索中语言偏见问题的有效方法，有助于实现更公平的多语言信息访问

Abstract: Language fairness in multilingual information retrieval (MLIR) systems is
crucial for ensuring equitable access to information across diverse languages.
This paper sheds light on the issue, based on the assumption that queries in
different languages, but with identical semantics, should yield equivalent
ranking lists when retrieving on the same multilingual documents. We evaluate
the degree of fairness using both traditional retrieval methods, and a DPR
neural ranker based on mBERT and XLM-R. Additionally, we introduce `LaKDA', a
novel loss designed to mitigate language biases in neural MLIR approaches. Our
analysis exposes intrinsic language biases in current MLIR technologies, with
notable disparities across the retrieval methods, and the effectiveness of
LaKDA in enhancing language fairness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spotify新增audiobook内容，但面临冷启动问题，用户交互数据少导致检索偏差，需要支持用户通过探索性查询发现audiobook

Method: 利用大型语言模型基于audiobook元数据生成合成查询，同时在查询自动补全和搜索检索引擎中索引这些合成查询

Result: 离线评估显示合成查询提高了可检索性和质量；在线A/B测试显示audiobook曝光率+0.7%，点击率+1.22%，探索性查询完成率+1.82%

Conclusion: AudioBoost通过合成查询生成有效解决了audiobook的冷启动检索问题，显著提升了用户发现和交互audiobook内容的能力

Abstract: Spotify has recently introduced audiobooks as part of its catalog,
complementing its music and podcast offering. Search is often the first entry
point for users to access new items, and an important goal for Spotify is to
support users in the exploration of the audiobook catalog. More specifically,
we would like to enable users without a specific item in mind to broadly search
by topic, genre, story tropes, decade, and discover audiobooks, authors and
publishers they may like. To do this, we need to 1) inspire users to type more
exploratory queries for audiobooks and 2) augment our retrieval systems to
better deal with exploratory audiobook queries. This is challenging in a
cold-start scenario, where we have a retrievabiliy bias due to the little
amount of user interactions with audiobooks compared to previously available
items such as music and podcast content. To address this, we propose
AudioBoost, a system to boost audiobook retrievability in Spotify's Search via
synthetic query generation. AudioBoost leverages Large Language Models (LLMs)
to generate synthetic queries conditioned on audiobook metadata. The synthetic
queries are indexed both in the Query AutoComplete (QAC) and in the Search
Retrieval engine to improve query formulation and retrieval at the same time.
We show through offline evaluation that synthetic queries increase
retrievability and are of high quality. Moreover, results from an online A/B
test show that AudioBoost leads to a +0.7% in audiobook impressions, +1.22% in
audiobook clicks, and +1.82% in audiobook exploratory query completions.

TL;DR: 提出基于LLM内部隐藏状态的知识边界感知方法，通过置信度检测和动态检索机制提升RAG性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在面对超出知识范围问题时产生幻觉的问题，现有RAG方法无法有效判断检索到的上下文是否真正有助于回答特定查询

Method: 构建基于LLM内部隐藏状态的置信度检测模型，创建偏好数据集微调重排序器，提出基于置信度的动态检索机制

Result: 在上下文筛选和端到端RAG性能上取得显著准确率提升，同时显著降低检索成本并保持竞争力准确率

Conclusion: 利用LLM连续内部隐藏状态的丰富信息可以有效提升知识边界感知能力，为RAG系统提供更有效的后检索知识过滤方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate inaccurate responses
(hallucinations) when faced with questions beyond their knowledge scope.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by leveraging external
knowledge, but a critical challenge remains: determining whether retrieved
contexts effectively enhance the model`s ability to answer specific queries.
This challenge underscores the importance of knowledge boundary awareness,
which current methods-relying on discrete labels or limited signals-fail to
address adequately, as they overlook the rich information in LLMs` continuous
internal hidden states. To tackle this, we propose a novel post-retrieval
knowledge filtering approach. First, we construct a confidence detection model
based on LLMs` internal hidden states to quantify how retrieved contexts
enhance the model`s confidence. Using this model, we build a preference dataset
(NQ_Rerank) to fine-tune a reranker, enabling it to prioritize contexts
preferred by the downstream LLM during reranking. Additionally, we introduce
Confidence-Based Dynamic Retrieval (CBDR), which adaptively triggers retrieval
based on the LLM`s initial confidence in the original question, reducing
knowledge conflicts and improving efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate
significant improvements in accuracy for context screening and end-to-end RAG
performance, along with a notable reduction in retrieval costs while
maintaining competitive accuracy.

TL;DR: ReDI是一个基于LLM的三阶段推理增强查询理解方法，通过分解复杂查询、语义解释增强和结果融合，显著提升了长查询的文档检索效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI搜索发展，长查询日益普遍但现有LLM方法主要针对短关键词查询，复杂意图的长查询理解研究不足

Method: 三阶段管道：1)分解复杂查询为子查询；2)为每个子查询添加详细语义解释；3)独立检索并融合结果

Result: 在BRIGHT和BEIR数据集上，ReDI在稀疏和稠密检索范式中均持续超越强基线方法

Conclusion: ReDI方法有效解决了复杂长查询的理解问题，通过分解和解释策略显著提升了检索性能，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Accurate inference of user intent is crucial for enhancing document retrieval
in modern search engines. While large language models (LLMs) have made
significant strides in this area, their effectiveness has predominantly been
assessed with short, keyword-based queries. As AI-driven search evolves,
long-form queries with intricate intents are becoming more prevalent, yet they
remain underexplored in the context of LLM-based query understanding (QU). To
bridge this gap, we introduce ReDI: a Reasoning-enhanced approach for query
understanding through Decomposition and Interpretation. ReDI leverages the
reasoning and comprehension capabilities of LLMs in a three-stage pipeline: (i)
it breaks down complex queries into targeted sub-queries to accurately capture
user intent; (ii) it enriches each sub-query with detailed semantic
interpretations to improve the query-document matching; and (iii) it
independently retrieves documents for each sub-query and employs a fusion
strategy to aggregate the results for the final ranking. We compiled a
large-scale dataset of real-world complex queries from a major search engine
and distilled the query understanding capabilities of teacher models into
smaller models for practical application. Experiments on BRIGHT and BEIR
demonstrate that ReDI consistently surpasses strong baselines in both sparse
and dense retrieval paradigms, affirming its effectiveness.

Abstract: Modern search systems play a crucial role in facilitating information
acquisition. Traditional search engines typically rely on a cascaded
architecture, where results are retrieved through recall, pre-ranking, and
ranking stages. The complexity of designing and maintaining multiple modules
makes it difficult to achieve holistic performance gains. Recent advances in
generative recommendation have motivated the exploration of unified generative
search as an alternative. However, existing approaches are not genuinely
end-to-end: they typically train an item encoder to tokenize candidates first
and then optimize a generator separately, leading to objective inconsistency
and limited generalization. To address these limitations, we propose UniSearch,
a unified generative search framework for Kuaishou Search. UniSearch replaces
the cascaded pipeline with an end-to-end architecture that integrates a Search
Generator and a Video Encoder. The Generator produces semantic identifiers of
relevant items given a user query, while the Video Encoder learns latent item
embeddings and provides their tokenized representations. A unified training
framework jointly optimizes both components, enabling mutual enhancement and
improving representation quality and generation accuracy. Furthermore, we
introduce Search Preference Optimization (SPO), which leverages a reward model
and real user feedback to better align generation with user preferences.
Extensive experiments on industrial-scale datasets, together with online A/B
testing in both short-video and live search scenarios, demonstrate the strong
effectiveness and deployment potential of UniSearch. Notably, its deployment in
live search yields the largest single-experiment improvement in recent years of
our product's history, highlighting its practical value for real-world
applications.
