### [1] [Boosting Adversarial Transferability via Residual Perturbation Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05689)
*Jinjia Peng,Zeze Tao,Huibing Wang,Meng Wang,Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ResPA的新型攻击方法，通过利用残差梯度作为扰动方向，提升对抗样本的迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有迁移攻击方法忽略了扰动方向的影响，导致迁移性有限。

Method: ResPA通过指数移动平均获取参考梯度，并利用当前梯度与参考梯度的残差来捕捉全局扰动方向的变化。

Result: 实验表明，ResPA的迁移性优于现有典型迁移攻击方法，且与输入变换方法结合后可进一步提升。

Conclusion: ResPA通过优化扰动方向，显著提升了对抗样本的迁移性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial examples while suffering
from incorrect predictions via imperceptible perturbations. Transfer-based
attacks create adversarial examples for surrogate models and transfer these
examples to target models under black-box scenarios. Recent studies reveal that
adversarial examples in flat loss landscapes exhibit superior transferability
to alleviate overfitting on surrogate models. However, the prior arts overlook
the influence of perturbation directions, resulting in limited transferability.
In this paper, we propose a novel attack method, named Residual Perturbation
Attack (ResPA), relying on the residual gradient as the perturbation direction
to guide the adversarial examples toward the flat regions of the loss function.
Specifically, ResPA conducts an exponential moving average on the input
gradients to obtain the first moment as the reference gradient, which
encompasses the direction of historical gradients. Instead of heavily relying
on the local flatness that stems from the current gradients as the perturbation
direction, ResPA further considers the residual between the current gradient
and the reference gradient to capture the changes in the global perturbation
direction. The experimental results demonstrate the better transferability of
ResPA than the existing typical transfer-based attack methods, while the
transferability can be further improved by combining ResPA with the current
input transformation methods. The code is available at

### [2] [Generalized Few-Shot Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05732)
*Pinxuan Li,Bing Cao,Changqing Zhang,Qinghua Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种广义少样本OOD检测框架（GOOD），通过引入通用知识模型（GKM）提升模型泛化能力，解决了现有方法因少样本学习导致的过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有少样本OOD检测方法泛化能力不足，容易过拟合，导致在开放世界中的性能下降和不一致性。

Method: 提出GOOD框架，利用GKM增强模型通用知识，并设计知识动态嵌入（KDE）机制动态调整通用知识指导。

Result: 实验证明GOOD在真实OOD基准测试中表现优越。

Conclusion: GOOD框架通过GS平衡和KDE机制显著提升了少样本OOD检测的泛化能力。

Abstract: Few-shot Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection has emerged as a critical
research direction in machine learning for practical deployment. Most existing
Few-shot OOD detection methods suffer from insufficient generalization
capability for the open world. Due to the few-shot learning paradigm, the OOD
detection ability is often overfit to the limited training data itself, thus
degrading the performance on generalized data and performing inconsistently
across different scenarios. To address this challenge, we proposed a
Generalized Few-shot OOD Detection (GOOD) framework, which empowers the general
knowledge of the OOD detection model with an auxiliary General Knowledge Model
(GKM), instead of directly learning from few-shot data. We proceed to reveal
the few-shot OOD detection from a generalization perspective and theoretically
derive the Generality-Specificity balance (GS-balance) for OOD detection, which
provably reduces the upper bound of generalization error with a general
knowledge model. Accordingly, we propose a Knowledge Dynamic Embedding (KDE)
mechanism to adaptively modulate the guidance of general knowledge. KDE
dynamically aligns the output distributions of the OOD detection model to the
general knowledge model based on the Generalized Belief (G-Belief) of GKM,
thereby boosting the GS-balance. Experiments on real-world OOD benchmarks
demonstrate our superiority. Codes will be available.

### [3] [UnGuide: Learning to Forget with LoRA-Guided Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05755)
*Agnieszka Polowczyk,Alicja Polowczyk,Dawid Malarz,Artur Kasymov,Marcin Mazur,Jacek Tabor,Przemysław Spurek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UnGuide是一种新方法，通过动态推理机制UnGuidance，结合LoRA适配器，实现对扩散模型中特定概念的精确遗忘，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模文本到图像扩散模型的潜在滥用引发了对有效机器遗忘的需求，即在不影响整体性能的情况下移除特定知识。

Method: UnGuide利用Classifier-Free Guidance（CFG）动态调整引导尺度，结合LoRA适配器，选择性遗忘特定概念。

Result: 实验表明，UnGuide在概念移除任务中优于现有LoRA方法，同时保持了图像的真实性和模型的表达能力。

Conclusion: UnGuide提供了一种高效且精确的机器遗忘解决方案，适用于扩散模型中的特定知识移除。

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have heightened
concerns about their potential misuse, especially in generating harmful or
misleading content. This underscores the urgent need for effective machine
unlearning, i.e., removing specific knowledge or concepts from pretrained
models without compromising overall performance. One possible approach is
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which offers an efficient means to fine-tune models
for targeted unlearning. However, LoRA often inadvertently alters unrelated
content, leading to diminished image fidelity and realism. To address this
limitation, we introduce UnGuide -- a novel approach which incorporates
UnGuidance, a dynamic inference mechanism that leverages Classifier-Free
Guidance (CFG) to exert precise control over the unlearning process. UnGuide
modulates the guidance scale based on the stability of a few first steps of
denoising processes, enabling selective unlearning by LoRA adapter. For prompts
containing the erased concept, the LoRA module predominates and is
counterbalanced by the base model; for unrelated prompts, the base model
governs generation, preserving content fidelity. Empirical results demonstrate
that UnGuide achieves controlled concept removal and retains the expressive
power of diffusion models, outperforming existing LoRA-based methods in both
object erasure and explicit content removal tasks.

### [4] [Improving Masked Style Transfer using Blended Partial Convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05769)
*Seyed Hadi Seyed,Ayberk Cansever,David Hart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于部分卷积的风格迁移网络，专注于对图像特定区域进行风格迁移，避免了传统方法在区域选择上的缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法对整个图像进行风格迁移后通过掩码处理特定区域，但会导致风格特征捕捉不准确。

Method: 采用部分卷积网络，结合内部混合技术，精确地对感兴趣区域进行风格迁移。

Result: 在SA-1B数据集上验证了该方法在视觉和定量上的改进。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了区域风格迁移的准确性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Artistic style transfer has long been possible with the advancements of
convolution- and transformer-based neural networks. Most algorithms apply the
artistic style transfer to the whole image, but individual users may only need
to apply a style transfer to a specific region in the image. The standard
practice is to simply mask the image after the stylization. This work shows
that this approach tends to improperly capture the style features in the region
of interest. We propose a partial-convolution-based style transfer network that
accurately applies the style features exclusively to the region of interest.
Additionally, we present network-internal blending techniques that account for
imperfections in the region selection. We show that this visually and
quantitatively improves stylization using examples from the SA-1B dataset. Code
is publicly available at https://github.com/davidmhart/StyleTransferMasked.

### [5] [MAISI-v2: Accelerated 3D High-Resolution Medical Image Synthesis with Rectified Flow and Region-specific Contrastive Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05772)
*Can Zhao,Pengfei Guo,Dong Yang,Yucheng Tang,Yufan He,Benjamin Simon,Mason Belue,Stephanie Harmon,Baris Turkbey,Daguang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAISI-v2是一个加速的3D医学图像合成框架，通过整合rectified flow实现快速高质量生成，并引入区域特异性对比损失提升条件一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有扩散模型在医学图像合成中的通用性差、推理速度慢和输入条件对齐弱的问题。

Method: 整合rectified flow加速生成，引入区域特异性对比损失增强条件一致性。

Result: MAISI-v2实现了33倍加速的潜在扩散模型，并达到SOTA图像质量，下游分割实验验证了合成图像的数据增强效果。

Conclusion: MAISI-v2在速度和条件一致性上显著改进，为医学图像合成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image synthesis is an important topic for both clinical and research
applications. Recently, diffusion models have become a leading approach in this
area. Despite their strengths, many existing methods struggle with (1) limited
generalizability that only work for specific body regions or voxel spacings,
(2) slow inference, which is a common issue for diffusion models, and (3) weak
alignment with input conditions, which is a critical issue for medical imaging.
MAISI, a previously proposed framework, addresses generalizability issues but
still suffers from slow inference and limited condition consistency. In this
work, we present MAISI-v2, the first accelerated 3D medical image synthesis
framework that integrates rectified flow to enable fast and high quality
generation. To further enhance condition fidelity, we introduce a novel
region-specific contrastive loss to enhance the sensitivity to region of
interest. Our experiments show that MAISI-v2 can achieve SOTA image quality
with $33 \times$ acceleration for latent diffusion model. We also conducted a
downstream segmentation experiment to show that the synthetic images can be
used for data augmentation. We release our code, training details, model
weights, and a GUI demo to facilitate reproducibility and promote further
development within the community.

### [6] [Few-Shot Deployment of Pretrained MRI Transformers in Brain Imaging Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05783)
*Mengyu Li,Guoyao Shen,Chad W. Farris,Xin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Masked Autoencoder（MAE）预训练的少样本MRI变换器框架，适用于多种脑成像任务，在数据有限条件下表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学影像中标注数据稀缺导致变换器模型实际应用受限的问题。

Method: 利用MAE预训练策略在大规模多队列脑MRI数据集上学习可迁移的潜在表示，并结合轻量级线性头或混合架构MAE-FUnet完成分类和分割任务。

Result: 在MRI序列识别中达到最先进精度，在分割任务中优于其他基线模型。

Conclusion: 该框架高效、稳定且可扩展，适合低资源临床环境和神经影像应用。

Abstract: Machine learning using transformers has shown great potential in medical
imaging, but its real-world applicability remains limited due to the scarcity
of annotated data. In this study, we propose a practical framework for the
few-shot deployment of pretrained MRI transformers in diverse brain imaging
tasks. By utilizing the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pretraining strategy on a
large-scale, multi-cohort brain MRI dataset comprising over 31 million slices,
we obtain highly transferable latent representations that generalize well
across tasks and datasets. For high-level tasks such as classification, a
frozen MAE encoder combined with a lightweight linear head achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy in MRI sequence identification with minimal
supervision. For low-level tasks such as segmentation, we propose MAE-FUnet, a
hybrid architecture that fuses multiscale CNN features with pretrained MAE
embeddings. This model consistently outperforms other strong baselines in both
skull stripping and multi-class anatomical segmentation under data-limited
conditions. With extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, our
framework demonstrates efficiency, stability, and scalability, suggesting its
suitability for low-resource clinical environments and broader neuroimaging
applications.

### [7] [Optimization-Free Style Transfer for 3D Gaussian Splats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05813)
*Raphael Du Sablon,David Hart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需重建或优化的3D高斯样条风格迁移方法，通过生成样条表示的隐式表面图结构，实现快速风格化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要重建或优化样条，或训练特征提取网络，效率较低。

Method: 生成样条隐式表面的图结构，使用前馈表面风格化方法并插值回样条。

Result: 无需额外训练或优化，支持任意风格图像和样条，速度低于2分钟。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且通用，代码已开源。

Abstract: The task of style transfer for 3D Gaussian splats has been explored in many
previous works, but these require reconstructing or fine-tuning the splat while
incorporating style information or optimizing a feature extraction network on
the splat representation. We propose a reconstruction- and optimization-free
approach to stylizing 3D Gaussian splats. This is done by generating a graph
structure across the implicit surface of the splat representation. A
feed-forward, surface-based stylization method is then used and interpolated
back to the individual splats in the scene. This allows for any style image and
3D Gaussian splat to be used without any additional training or optimization.
This also allows for fast stylization of splats, achieving speeds under 2
minutes even on consumer-grade hardware. We demonstrate the quality results
this approach achieves and compare to other 3D Gaussian splat style transfer
methods. Code is publicly available at
https://github.com/davidmhart/FastSplatStyler.

### [8] [MZEN: Multi-Zoom Enhanced NeRF for 3-D Reconstruction with Unknown Camera Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05819)
*Jong-Ik Park,Carlee Joe-Wong,Gary K. Fedder*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MZEN是一种改进的NeRF框架，通过处理多缩放图像集，显著提升了工业检测中的细节捕捉能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NeRF方法在多缩放图像集下无法保持多视角一致性，难以捕捉工业检测所需的细微结构。

Method: MZEN引入可学习的缩放标量，并通过分阶段姿态策略（先全局后局部）优化多缩放图像的联合训练。

Result: 在多个场景中，MZEN显著提升了PSNR、SSIM和LPIPS指标，最高提升28%、10%和减少222%。

Conclusion: MZEN成功扩展了NeRF在工业检测中的应用，兼顾全局精度和微米级细节。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) methods excel at 3D reconstruction from
multiple 2D images, even those taken with unknown camera poses. However, they
still miss the fine-detailed structures that matter in industrial inspection,
e.g., detecting sub-micron defects on a production line or analyzing chips with
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). In these scenarios, the sensor resolution
is fixed and compute budgets are tight, so the only way to expose fine
structure is to add zoom-in images; yet, this breaks the multi-view consistency
that pose-free NeRF training relies on. We propose Multi-Zoom Enhanced NeRF
(MZEN), the first NeRF framework that natively handles multi-zoom image sets.
MZEN (i) augments the pin-hole camera model with an explicit, learnable zoom
scalar that scales the focal length, and (ii) introduces a novel pose strategy:
wide-field images are solved first to establish a global metric frame, and
zoom-in images are then pose-primed to the nearest wide-field counterpart via a
zoom-consistent crop-and-match procedure before joint refinement. Across eight
forward-facing scenes$\unicode{x2013}$synthetic TCAD models, real SEM of
micro-structures, and BLEFF objects$\unicode{x2013}$MZEN consistently
outperforms pose-free baselines and even high-resolution variants, boosting
PSNR by up to $28 \%$, SSIM by $10 \%$, and reducing LPIPS by up to $222 \%$.
MZEN, therefore, extends NeRF to real-world factory settings, preserving global
accuracy while capturing the micron-level details essential for industrial
inspection.

### [9] [TSMS-SAM2: Multi-scale Temporal Sampling Augmentation and Memory-Splitting Pruning for Promptable Video Object Segmentation and Tracking in Surgical Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05829)
*Guoping Xu,Hua-Chieh Shao,You Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TSMS-SAM2是一种改进的可提示视频对象分割与跟踪框架，针对手术视频中的快速运动和内存冗余问题，通过多时间尺度采样和内存修剪机制提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术视频分析中，复杂运动动态和内存冗余限制了基础模型（如SAM2）的应用效果。

Method: 提出TSMS-SAM2框架，采用多时间尺度视频采样增强和内存分割修剪机制。

Result: 在EndoVis2017和EndoVis2018数据集上分别达到95.24和86.73的Dice分数，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TSMS-SAM2在复杂手术场景中表现出高效、鲁棒的分割潜力。

Abstract: Promptable video object segmentation and tracking (VOST) has seen significant
advances with the emergence of foundation models like Segment Anything Model 2
(SAM2); however, their application in surgical video analysis remains
challenging due to complex motion dynamics and the redundancy of memory that
impedes effective learning. In this work, we propose TSMS-SAM2, a novel
framework that enhances promptable VOST in surgical videos by addressing
challenges of rapid object motion and memory redundancy in SAM2. TSMS-SAM2
introduces two key strategies: multi-temporal-scale video sampling augmentation
to improve robustness against motion variability, and a memory splitting and
pruning mechanism that organizes and filters past frame features for more
efficient and accurate segmentation. Evaluated on EndoVis2017 and EndoVis2018
datasets, TSMS-SAM2 achieved the highest mean Dice scores of 95.24 and 86.73,
respectively, outperforming prior SAM-based and task-specific methods.
Extensive ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of multiscale temporal
augmentation and memory splitting, highlighting the framework's potential for
robust, efficient segmentation in complex surgical scenarios. Our source code
will be available at https://github.com/apple1986/TSMS-SAM2.

*Ka-Wai Yung,Felix J. S. Bragman,Jialang Xu,Imanol Luengo,Danail Stoyanov,Evangelos B. Mazomenos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TCA的轻量级策略，通过利用帧间时间一致性优化视频分割中的token聚类，显著减少计算量并保持精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Swin Transformer在视频分割中计算成本高，现有token缩减方法无法充分利用时间冗余。

Method: 提出TCA策略，通过时间相关性优化token聚类，避免冗余token丢弃。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，TCA显著提升了精度与速度的平衡。

Conclusion: TCA是一种无需微调的高效方法，适用于自然和特定领域视频。

Abstract: Vision Transformers have substantially advanced the capabilities of
segmentation models across both image and video domains. Among them, the Swin
Transformer stands out for its ability to capture hierarchical, multi-scale
representations, making it a popular backbone for segmentation in videos.
However, despite its window-attention scheme, it still incurs a high
computational cost, especially in larger variants commonly used for dense
prediction in videos. This remains a major bottleneck for real-time,
resource-constrained applications. Whilst token reduction methods have been
proposed to alleviate this, the window-based attention mechanism of Swin
requires a fixed number of tokens per window, limiting the applicability of
conventional pruning techniques. Meanwhile, training-free token clustering
approaches have shown promise in image segmentation while maintaining window
consistency. Nevertheless, they fail to exploit temporal redundancy, missing a
key opportunity to further optimize video segmentation performance. We
introduce Temporal Cluster Assignment (TCA), a lightweight and effective,
fine-tuning-free strategy that enhances token clustering by leveraging temporal
coherence across frames. Instead of indiscriminately dropping redundant tokens,
TCA refines token clusters using temporal correlations, thereby retaining
fine-grained details while significantly reducing computation. Extensive
evaluations on YouTube-VIS 2019, YouTube-VIS 2021, OVIS, and a private surgical
video dataset show that TCA consistently boosts the accuracy-speed trade-off of
existing clustering-based methods. Our results demonstrate that TCA generalizes
competently across both natural and domain-specific videos.

*Kaiser Hamid,Khandakar Ashrafi Akbar,Nade Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉-语言框架的驾驶员视觉注意力预测方法，通过自然语言描述注意力变化，支持少样本和零样本学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注静态图像中的注意力分配，缺乏对动态注意力变化的建模，且难以解释。

Method: 利用BDD-A数据集的高质量标注，通过人类反馈优化，微调LLaVA模型，结合低层线索和上下文（如路线语义、风险预测）生成语言描述。

Result: 微调模型在注意力转移检测和可解释性上优于通用视觉-语言模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动驾驶中的可解释AI提供了新方向，支持行为预测和人机协作等下游任务。

Abstract: Driver visual attention prediction is a critical task in autonomous driving
and human-computer interaction (HCI) research. Most prior studies focus on
estimating attention allocation at a single moment in time, typically using
static RGB images such as driving scene pictures. In this work, we propose a
vision-language framework that models the changing landscape of drivers' gaze
through natural language, using few-shot and zero-shot learning on single RGB
images. We curate and refine high-quality captions from the BDD-A dataset using
human-in-the-loop feedback, then fine-tune LLaVA to align visual perception
with attention-centric scene understanding. Our approach integrates both
low-level cues and top-down context (e.g., route semantics, risk anticipation),
enabling language-based descriptions of gaze behavior. We evaluate performance
across training regimes (few shot, and one-shot) and introduce domain-specific
metrics for semantic alignment and response diversity. Results show that our
fine-tuned model outperforms general-purpose VLMs in attention shift detection
and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is among the first attempts to
generate driver visual attention allocation and shifting predictions in natural
language, offering a new direction for explainable AI in autonomous driving.
Our approach provides a foundation for downstream tasks such as behavior
forecasting, human-AI teaming, and multi-agent coordination.

### [12] [Multi-view Gaze Target Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05857)
*Qiaomu Miao,Vivek Raju Golani,Jingyi Xu,Progga Paromita Dutta,Minh Hoai,Dimitris Samaras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种多视角相机方法用于视线目标估计（GTE），通过整合不同视角信息提升准确性和适用性，解决单视角方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单视角GTE方法面临面部遮挡、目标模糊和视野外目标等挑战，多视角方法能显著提升性能。

Method: 结合头部信息聚合（HIA）、不确定性视线选择（UGS）和极线场景注意力（ESA）模块，处理双视角输入。

Result: 显著优于单视角基线，尤其在第二视角清晰捕捉面部时；还能仅用第二视角图像估计第一视角的视线目标。

Conclusion: 多视角方法有效提升GTE性能，并引入新数据集支持多视角GTE研究。

Abstract: This paper presents a method that utilizes multiple camera views for the gaze
target estimation (GTE) task. The approach integrates information from
different camera views to improve accuracy and expand applicability, addressing
limitations in existing single-view methods that face challenges such as face
occlusion, target ambiguity, and out-of-view targets. Our method processes a
pair of camera views as input, incorporating a Head Information Aggregation
(HIA) module for leveraging head information from both views for more accurate
gaze estimation, an Uncertainty-based Gaze Selection (UGS) for identifying the
most reliable gaze output, and an Epipolar-based Scene Attention (ESA) module
for cross-view background information sharing. This approach significantly
outperforms single-view baselines, especially when the second camera provides a
clear view of the person's face. Additionally, our method can estimate the gaze
target in the first view using the image of the person in the second view only,
a capability not possessed by single-view GTE methods. Furthermore, the paper
introduces a multi-view dataset for developing and evaluating multi-view GTE
methods. Data and code are available at

### [13] [ETTA: Efficient Test-Time Adaptation for Vision-Language Models through Dynamic Embedding Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05898)
*Hamidreza Dastmalchi,Aijun An,Ali cheraghian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ETTA提出了一种高效的测试时适应方法，通过递归更新模块和自适应集成模块，显著提升了CLIP等预训练视觉语言模型在分布偏移下的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在零样本任务中表现良好，但在分布偏移下泛化能力有限。测试时适应（TTA）通过适应未标记的测试数据来解决这一问题，但现有方法存在局限性。

Method: ETTA引入递归更新模块，动态整合所有测试样本以优化决策边界，并结合自适应集成模块减少对提示的依赖。通过置信度动态结合两个模块的输出。

Result: 在两个基准测试中，ETTA在计算复杂度和准确性上均优于现有TTA模型。

Conclusion: ETTA为高效、有效的测试时适应设定了新标准，代码已开源。

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP show strong zero-shot
performance but struggle with generalization under distribution shifts.
Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this by adapting VLMs to unlabeled test
data in new domains. While some TTA methods rely on prompt-tuning,
training-free cache-based approaches are preferred for efficiency. However,
current cache-based TTA models store only a limited set of high-confidence
samples, restricting the decision boundary to these samples and ignoring the
influence of other incoming test data. To address this, we propose Efficient
Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA), introducing a Recursive Updating module that
integrates all incoming test samples, progressively refining the decision
boundary. This strategy mimics an unbounded cache, dynamically updating
contextual embeddings for improved accuracy with minimal memory and
computational overhead. ETTA also includes an Adaptive Ensemble module to
reduce prompt dependency in image-to-text scores by dynamically selecting
optimal prompts for each class. Furthermore, ETTA adaptively combines scores
from both modules based on confidence levels, leveraging their complementary
strengths. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks confirm that ETTA surpasses
the state-of-the-art TTA models in computational complexity and accuracy,
setting a new standard for effective, efficient test-time adaptation. The code
has been released at https://github.com/hamidreza-dastmalchi/ETTA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOLODECK 2.0是一个基于视觉语言模型的3D场景生成框架，支持通过文本生成多样化、风格丰富的3D场景，并支持交互式编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D场景生成依赖大量人工，且现有自动化方法难以生成开放域场景或支持灵活编辑。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型解析场景需求，结合3D生成模型生成高质量资产，并通过空间约束实现语义连贯的布局。

Result: HOLODECK 2.0在人类评估和CLIP测试中表现优于基线，生成场景与文本描述高度一致。

Conclusion: HOLODECK 2.0在3D场景生成和编辑方面表现出色，可应用于游戏建模等领域提升效率。

Abstract: 3D scene generation plays a crucial role in gaming, artistic creation,
virtual reality and many other domains. However, current 3D scene design still
relies heavily on extensive manual effort from creators, and existing automated
methods struggle to generate open-domain scenes or support flexible editing. As
a result, generating 3D worlds directly from text has garnered increasing
attention. In this paper, we introduce HOLODECK 2.0, an advanced
vision-language-guided framework for 3D world generation with support for
interactive scene editing based on human feedback. HOLODECK 2.0 can generate
diverse and stylistically rich 3D scenes (e.g., realistic, cartoon, anime, and
cyberpunk styles) that exhibit high semantic fidelity to fine-grained input
descriptions, suitable for both indoor and open-domain environments. HOLODECK
2.0 leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to identify and parse the objects
required in a scene and generates corresponding high-quality assets via
state-of-the-art 3D generative models. It then iteratively applies spatial
constraints derived from the VLMs to achieve semantically coherent and
physically plausible layouts. Human evaluations and CLIP-based assessments
demonstrate that HOLODECK 2.0 effectively generates high-quality scenes closely
aligned with detailed textual descriptions, consistently outperforming
baselines across indoor and open-domain scenarios. Additionally, we provide
editing capabilities that flexibly adapt to human feedback, supporting layout
refinement and style-consistent object edits. Finally, we present a practical
application of HOLODECK 2.0 in procedural game modeling, generating visually
rich and immersive environments, potentially boosting efficiency.

with both robustness and naturalness. To ensure the robustness of
\textit{RopStitch}, we propose to incorporate the universal prior of content
perception into the image stitching model by a dual-branch architecture. It
separately captures coarse and fine features and integrates them to achieve
highly generalizable performance across diverse unseen real-world scenes.
Concretely, the dual-branch model consists of a pretrained branch to capture
semantically invariant representations and a learnable branch to extract
fine-grained discriminative features, which are then merged into a whole by a
controllable factor at the correlation level. Besides, considering that content
alignment and structural preservation are often contradictory to each other, we
propose a concept of virtual optimal planes to relieve this conflict. To this
end, we model this problem as a process of estimating homography decomposition
coefficients, and design an iterative coefficient predictor and minimal
semantic distortion constraint to identify the optimal plane. This scheme is
finally incorporated into \textit{RopStitch} by warping both views onto the
optimal plane bidirectionally. Extensive experiments across various datasets
demonstrate that \textit{RopStitch} significantly outperforms existing methods,
particularly in scene robustness and content naturalness. The code is available

Abstract: Over the past two decades, mobile imaging has experienced a profound
transformation, with cell phones rapidly eclipsing all other forms of digital
photography in popularity. Today's cell phones are equipped with a diverse
range of imaging technologies - laser depth ranging, multi-focal camera arrays,
and split-pixel sensors - alongside non-visual sensors such as gyroscopes,
accelerometers, and magnetometers. This, combined with on-board integrated
chips for image and signal processing, makes the cell phone a versatile
pocket-sized computational imaging platform. Parallel to this, we have seen in
recent years how neural fields - small neural networks trained to map
continuous spatial input coordinates to output signals - enable the
reconstruction of complex scenes without explicit data representations such as
pixel arrays or point clouds. In this thesis, I demonstrate how carefully
designed neural field models can compactly represent complex geometry and
lighting effects. Enabling applications such as depth estimation, layer
separation, and image stitching directly from collected in-the-wild mobile
photography data. These methods outperform state-of-the-art approaches without
relying on complex pre-processing steps, labeled ground truth data, or machine
learning priors. Instead, they leverage well-constructed, self-regularized
models that tackle challenging inverse problems through stochastic gradient
descent, fitting directly to raw measurements from a smartphone.

Abstract: Monitoring construction progress is crucial yet resource-intensive, prompting
the exploration of computer-vision-based methodologies for enhanced efficiency
and scalability. Traditional data acquisition methods, primarily focusing on
indoor environments, falter in construction site's complex, cluttered, and
dynamically changing conditions. This paper critically evaluates the
application of two advanced 3D segmentation methods, Segment Anything Model
(SAM) and Mask3D, in challenging outdoor and indoor conditions. Trained
initially on indoor datasets, both models' adaptability and performance are
assessed in real-world construction settings, highlighting the gap in current
segmentation approaches due to the absence of benchmarks for outdoor scenarios.
Through a comparative analysis, this study not only showcases the relative
effectiveness of SAM and Mask3D but also addresses the critical need for
tailored segmentation workflows capable of extracting actionable insights from
construction site data, thereby advancing the field towards more automated and
precise monitoring techniques.

Conclusion: SINGAD通过自监督优化和几何误差传播，实现了多视角一致的法线估计，减少了对标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: The lack of spatial dimensional information remains a challenge in normal
estimation from a single image. Recent diffusion-based methods have
demonstrated significant potential in 2D-to-3D implicit mapping, they rely on
data-driven statistical priors and miss the explicit modeling of light-surface
interaction, leading to multi-view normal direction conflicts. Moreover, the
discrete sampling mechanism of diffusion models causes gradient discontinuity
in differentiable rendering reconstruction modules, preventing 3D geometric
errors from being backpropagated to the normal generation network, thereby
forcing existing methods to depend on dense normal annotations. This paper
proposes SINGAD, a novel Self-supervised framework from a single Image for
Normal estimation via 3D GAussian splatting guided Diffusion. By integrating
physics-driven light-interaction modeling and a differentiable rendering-based
reprojection strategy, our framework directly converts 3D geometric errors into
normal optimization signals, solving the challenges of multi-view geometric
inconsistency and data dependency. Specifically, the framework constructs a
light-interaction-driven 3DGS reparameterization model to generate multi-scale
geometric features consistent with light transport principles, ensuring
multi-view normal consistency. A cross-domain feature fusion module is designed
within a conditional diffusion model, embedding geometric priors to constrain
normal generation while maintaining accurate geometric error propagation.
Furthermore, a differentiable 3D reprojection loss strategy is introduced for
self-supervised optimization that minimizes geometric error between the
reconstructed and input image, eliminating dependence on annotated normal
datasets. Quantitative evaluations on the Google Scanned Objects dataset
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across
multiple metrics.

Motivation: 现有方法在训练成本高且未充分利用预训练LLMs的图像表示能力，因此需要一种更高效的框架。

Method: 使用patch级CLIP图像嵌入作为潜在变量，通过轻量级ControlNet适配扩散模型，并保留MLLMs的多模态推理能力。

Result: Bifrost-1在视觉保真度和多模态理解上表现优异，且训练计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: 该框架成功整合了预训练MLLMs和扩散模型，为高效可控图像生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: There is growing interest in integrating high-fidelity visual synthesis
capabilities into large language models (LLMs) without compromising their
strong reasoning capabilities. Existing methods that directly train LLMs or
bridge LLMs and diffusion models usually suffer from costly training since the
backbone LLMs have not seen image representations during pretraining. We
present Bifrost-1, a unified framework that bridges pretrained multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs) and diffusion models using patch-level CLIP image embeddings as latent
variables, which are natively aligned with the MLLM's CLIP visual encoder.
These patch-level image embeddings are integrated into the diffusion model with
a lightweight adaptation of its ControlNet. To retain the original multimodal
reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, we equip the MLLM with a visual generation
branch initialized from the original MLLM parameters when predicting the
patch-level image embeddings. By seamlessly integrating pretrained MLLMs and
diffusion models with patch-level CLIP latents, our framework enables
high-fidelity controllable image generation with significant training
efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate that Bifrost-1 achieves comparable or
better performance than previous methods in terms of visual fidelity and
multimodal understanding, with substantially lower compute during training. We
also provide comprehensive ablation studies showing the effectiveness of our
design choices.

Result: 在多样化机器人操作任务中表现优异，性能接近人工标注。

Conclusion: PASG实现了更细粒度的语义-功能理解，为机器人操作提供了统一的语义-几何范式。

Abstract: The fragmentation between high-level task semantics and low-level geometric
features remains a persistent challenge in robotic manipulation. While
vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in generating affordance-aware
visual representations, the lack of semantic grounding in canonical spaces and
reliance on manual annotations severely limit their ability to capture dynamic
semantic-affordance relationships. To address these, we propose Primitive-Aware
Semantic Grounding (PASG), a closed-loop framework that introduces: (1)
Automatic primitive extraction through geometric feature aggregation, enabling
cross-category detection of keypoints and axes; (2) VLM-driven semantic
anchoring that dynamically couples geometric primitives with functional
affordances and task-relevant description; (3) A spatial-semantic reasoning
benchmark and a fine-tuned VLM (Qwen2.5VL-PA). We demonstrate PASG's
effectiveness in practical robotic manipulation tasks across diverse scenarios,
achieving performance comparable to manual annotations. PASG achieves a
finer-grained semantic-affordance understanding of objects, establishing a
unified paradigm for bridging geometric primitives with task semantics in
robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: AnimateScene成功解决了3D场景与4D人体动画的集成问题，实现了视觉上吸引人的动态视频。

Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction and 4D human animation have seen rapid progress and
broad adoption in recent years. However, seamlessly integrating reconstructed
scenes with 4D human animation to produce visually engaging results remains
challenging. One key difficulty lies in placing the human at the correct
location and scale within the scene while avoiding unrealistic
interpenetration. Another challenge is that the human and the background may
exhibit different lighting and style, leading to unrealistic composites. In
addition, appealing character motion videos are often accompanied by camera
movements, which means that the viewpoints need to be reconstructed along a
specified trajectory. We present AnimateScene, which addresses the above issues
in a unified framework. First, we design an accurate placement module that
automatically determines a plausible 3D position for the human and prevents any
interpenetration within the scene during motion. Second, we propose a
training-free style alignment method that adapts the 4D human representation to
match the background's lighting and style, achieving coherent visual
integration. Finally, we design a joint post-reconstruction method for both the
4D human and the 3D scene that allows camera trajectories to be inserted,
enabling the final rendered video to feature visually appealing camera
movements. Extensive experiments show that AnimateScene generates dynamic scene
videos with high geometric detail and spatiotemporal coherence across various
camera and action combinations.

Conclusion: ETA通过能量模型有效解决了测试时适应问题，显著提升了模型在新环境中的表现。

Abstract: We propose a method for test-time adaptation of pretrained depth completion
models. Depth completion models, trained on some ``source'' data, often predict
erroneous outputs when transferred to ``target'' data captured in novel
environmental conditions due to a covariate shift. The crux of our method lies
in quantifying the likelihood of depth predictions belonging to the source data
distribution. The challenge is in the lack of access to out-of-distribution
(target) data prior to deployment. Hence, rather than making assumptions
regarding the target distribution, we utilize adversarial perturbations as a
mechanism to explore the data space. This enables us to train an energy model
that scores local regions of depth predictions as in- or out-of-distribution.
We update the parameters of pretrained depth completion models at test time to
minimize energy, effectively aligning test-time predictions to those of the
source distribution. We call our method ``Energy-based Test-time Adaptation'',
or ETA for short. We evaluate our method across three indoor and three outdoor
datasets, where ETA improve over the previous state-of-the-art method by an
average of 6.94% for outdoors and 10.23% for indoors. Project Page:

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个任务中实现了显著加速，仅带来轻微性能损失。

Conclusion: 该方法通过优化前端计算和运动估计，显著提升了视频计算机视觉系统的效率。

Abstract: The efficiency of video computer vision system remains a challenging task due
to the high temporal redundancy inside a video. Existing works have been
proposed for efficient vision computer vision. However, they do not fully
reduce the temporal redundancy and neglect the front end computation overhead.
In this paper, we propose an efficient video computer vision system. First,
image signal processor is removed and Bayer-format data is directly fed into
video computer vision models, thus saving the front end computation. Second,
instead of optical flow models and video codecs, a fast block matching-based
motion estimation algorithm is proposed specifically for efficient video
computer vision, with a MV refinement module. To correct the error,
context-aware block refinement network is introduced to refine regions with
large error. To further balance the accuracy and efficiency, a frame selection
strategy is employed. Experiments on multiple video computer vision tasks
demonstrate that our method achieves significant acceleration with slight
performance loss.

Conclusion: 提出的多模态情感识别框架有效提升了性能，验证了其在数据稀缺情况下的实用性。

Abstract: Emotion recognition plays a vital role in enhancing human-computer
interaction. In this study, we tackle the MER-SEMI challenge of the MER2025
competition by proposing a novel multimodal emotion recognition framework. To
address the issue of data scarcity, we leverage large-scale pre-trained models
to extract informative features from visual, audio, and textual modalities.
Specifically, for the visual modality, we design a dual-branch visual encoder
that captures both global frame-level features and localized facial
representations. For the textual modality, we introduce a context-enriched
method that employs large language models to enrich emotional cues within the
input text. To effectively integrate these multimodal features, we propose a
fusion strategy comprising two key components, i.e., self-attention mechanisms
for dynamic modality weighting, and residual connections to preserve original
representations. Beyond architectural design, we further refine noisy labels in
the training set by a multi-source labeling strategy. Our approach achieves a
substantial performance improvement over the official baseline on the
MER2025-SEMI dataset, attaining a weighted F-score of 87.49% compared to
78.63%, thereby validating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在面部化妆编辑中常因缺乏结构化配对数据而导致低质量结果，无法同时保持身份和化妆保真度。

Method: 作者提出了MakeupQuad数据集和EvoMakeup框架，通过多阶段蒸馏避免图像退化，支持多种化妆编辑任务。

Result: EvoMakeup在真实场景中表现优异，实现了高保真、可控的多任务化妆编辑。

Conclusion: 该方法在化妆保真度和身份保留上取得了平衡，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Facial makeup editing aims to realistically transfer makeup from a reference
to a target face. Existing methods often produce low-quality results with
coarse makeup details and struggle to preserve both identity and makeup
fidelity, mainly due to the lack of structured paired data -- where source and
result share identity, and reference and result share identical makeup. To
address this, we introduce MakeupQuad, a large-scale, high-quality dataset with
non-makeup faces, references, edited results, and textual makeup descriptions.
Building on this, we propose EvoMakeup, a unified training framework that
mitigates image degradation during multi-stage distillation, enabling iterative
improvement of both data and model quality. Although trained solely on
synthetic data, EvoMakeup generalizes well and outperforms prior methods on
real-world benchmarks. It supports high-fidelity, controllable, multi-task
makeup editing -- including full-face and partial reference-based editing, as
well as text-driven makeup editing -- within a single model. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method achieves superior makeup fidelity and
identity preservation, effectively balancing both aspects. Code and dataset
will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in visual mathematical reasoning across various existing
benchmarks. However, these benchmarks are predominantly based on clean or
processed multimodal inputs, without incorporating the images provided by
real-world Kindergarten through 12th grade (K-12) educational users. To address
this gap, we introduce MathReal, a meticulously curated dataset comprising
2,000 mathematical questions with images captured by handheld mobile devices in
authentic scenarios. Each question is an image, containing the question text
and visual element. We systematically classify the real images into three
primary categories: image quality degradation, perspective variation, and
irrelevant content interference, which are further delineated into 14
subcategories. Additionally, MathReal spans five core knowledge and ability
categories, which encompass three question types and are divided into three
difficulty levels. To comprehensively evaluate the multimodal mathematical
reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs in real-world scenarios, we
design six experimental settings that enable a systematic analysis of their
performance. Through extensive experimentation, we find that the
problem-solving abilities of existing MLLMs are significantly challenged in
realistic educational contexts. Based on this, we conduct a thorough analysis
of their performance and error patterns, providing insights into their
recognition, comprehension, and reasoning capabilities, and outlining
directions for future improvements. Data and code:

Abstract: Recent advances in novel view synthesis (NVS) have enabled real-time
rendering with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). However, existing methods struggle
with artifacts and missing regions when rendering from viewpoints that deviate
from the training trajectory, limiting seamless scene exploration. To address
this, we propose a 3DGS-based pipeline that generates additional training views
to enhance reconstruction. We introduce an information-gain-driven virtual
camera placement strategy to maximize scene coverage, followed by video
diffusion priors to refine rendered results. Fine-tuning 3D Gaussians with
these enhanced views significantly improves reconstruction quality. To evaluate
our method, we present Wild-Explore, a benchmark designed for challenging scene
exploration. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
3DGS-based methods, enabling high-quality, artifact-free rendering from
arbitrary viewpoints.

Abstract: Sub-visible particle analysis using flow imaging microscopy combined with
deep learning has proven effective in identifying particle types, enabling the
distinction of harmless components such as silicone oil from protein particles.
However, the scarcity of available data and severe imbalance between particle
types within datasets remain substantial hurdles when applying multi-class
classifiers to such problems, often forcing researchers to rely on less
effective methods. The aforementioned issue is particularly challenging for
particle types that appear unintentionally and in lower numbers, such as
silicone oil and air bubbles, as opposed to protein particles, where obtaining
large numbers of images through controlled settings is comparatively
straightforward. In this work, we develop a state-of-the-art diffusion model to
address data imbalance by generating high-fidelity images that can augment
training datasets, enabling the effective training of multi-class deep neural
networks. We validate this approach by demonstrating that the generated samples
closely resemble real particle images in terms of visual quality and structure.
To assess the effectiveness of using diffusion-generated images in training
datasets, we conduct large-scale experiments on a validation dataset comprising
500,000 protein particle images and demonstrate that this approach improves
classification performance with no negligible downside. Finally, to promote
open research and reproducibility, we publicly release both our diffusion
models and the trained multi-class deep neural network classifiers, along with
a straightforward interface for easy integration into future studies, at

Conclusion: Spectrum通过改进的扩散模型实现了细粒度人体解析，为开放词汇分割任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Existing methods for human parsing into body parts and clothing often use
fixed mask categories with broad labels that obscure fine-grained clothing
types. Recent open-vocabulary segmentation approaches leverage pretrained
text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model features for strong zero-shot transfer, but
typically group entire humans into a single person category, failing to
distinguish diverse clothing or detailed body parts. To address this, we
propose Spectrum, a unified network for part-level pixel parsing (body parts
and clothing) and instance-level grouping. While diffusion-based
open-vocabulary models generalize well across tasks, their internal
representations are not specialized for detailed human parsing. We observe
that, unlike diffusion models with broad representations, image-driven 3D
texture generators maintain faithful correspondence to input images, enabling
stronger representations for parsing diverse clothing and body parts. Spectrum
introduces a novel repurposing of an Image-to-Texture (I2Tx) diffusion model --
obtained by fine-tuning a T2I model on 3D human texture maps -- for improved
alignment with body parts and clothing. From an input image, we extract
human-part internal features via the I2Tx diffusion model and generate
semantically valid masks aligned to diverse clothing categories through
prompt-guided grounding. Once trained, Spectrum produces semantic segmentation
maps for every visible body part and clothing category, ignoring standalone
garments or irrelevant objects, for any number of humans in the scene. We
conduct extensive cross-dataset experiments -- separately assessing body parts,
clothing parts, unseen clothing categories, and full-body masks -- and
demonstrate that Spectrum consistently outperforms baseline methods in
prompt-based segmentation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文本引导图像编辑方法在速度和内容保留上的不足，实现快速且高质量的编辑。

Method: 采用RectifiedFlow框架，引入PerRFI反转策略、Inversion Latent Injection技术和Disentangled Prompt Guidance，结合Canny-conditioned ControlNet。

Result: 在PIE数据集上表现优于现有方法，速度快且编辑质量高。

Conclusion: InstantEdit在速度和编辑效果上均优于现有方法，为文本引导图像编辑提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a fast text-guided image editing method called InstantEdit based
on the RectifiedFlow framework, which is structured as a few-step editing
process that preserves critical content while following closely to textual
instructions. Our approach leverages the straight sampling trajectories of
RectifiedFlow by introducing a specialized inversion strategy called PerRFI. To
maintain consistent while editable results for RectifiedFlow model, we further
propose a novel regeneration method, Inversion Latent Injection, which
effectively reuses latent information obtained during inversion to facilitate
more coherent and detailed regeneration. Additionally, we propose a
Disentangled Prompt Guidance technique to balance editability with detail
preservation, and integrate a Canny-conditioned ControlNet to incorporate
structural cues and suppress artifacts. Evaluation on the PIE image editing
dataset demonstrates that InstantEdit is not only fast but also achieves better
qualitative and quantitative results compared to state-of-the-art few-step
editing methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种半监督学习框架，通过混合专家模型（MoE）整合多模态输入，结合伪标签策略和多专家投票集成，在MER2025-SEMI挑战中取得第二名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决半监督学习中的情感识别问题，利用多模态数据和未标记数据提升模型性能。

Method: 采用混合专家模型整合多模态输入（如视觉语言模型和动作单元信息），引入共识伪标签策略，并利用两阶段训练和多专家投票集成优化预测。

Result: 在MER2025-SEMI测试集上F1得分为0.8772，排名第二。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效整合多模态数据和半监督学习策略，显著提升了情感识别性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we present our solution for the semi-supervised learning track
(MER-SEMI) in MER2025. We propose a comprehensive framework, grounded in the
principle that "more is better," to construct a robust Mixture of Experts (MoE)
emotion recognition system. Our approach integrates a diverse range of input
modalities as independent experts, including novel signals such as knowledge
from large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and temporal Action Unit (AU)
information. To effectively utilize unlabeled data, we introduce a
consensus-based pseudo-labeling strategy, generating high-quality labels from
the agreement between a baseline model and Gemini, which are then used in a
two-stage training paradigm. Finally, we employ a multi-expert voting ensemble
combined with a rule-based re-ranking process to correct prediction bias and
better align the outputs with human preferences. Evaluated on the MER2025-SEMI
challenge dataset, our method achieves an F1-score of 0.8772 on the test set,
ranking 2nd in the track. Our code is available at

*Huanyu Wang,Jushi Kai,Haoli Bai,Lu Hou,Bo Jiang,Ziwei He,Zhouhan Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fourier-VLM通过频域压缩视觉表征，显著减少计算开销和推理延迟，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型中视觉特征的高维度导致计算开销大，现有方法在减少特征数量时牺牲性能或增加成本。

Method: 利用视觉特征在低频能量集中的特性，通过二维离散余弦变换（DCT）和快速傅里叶变换（FFT）压缩特征。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，推理FLOPs减少83.8%，生成速度提升31.2%。

Conclusion: Fourier-VLM在高效性和实用性上具有显著优势，适用于多种架构。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) typically replace the predefined image
placeholder token (<image>) in textual instructions with visual features from
an image encoder, forming the input to a backbone Large Language Model (LLM).
However, the large number of vision tokens significantly increases the context
length, leading to high computational overhead and inference latency. While
previous efforts mitigate this by selecting only important visual features or
leveraging learnable queries to reduce token count, they often compromise
performance or introduce substantial extra costs. In response, we propose
Fourier-VLM, a simple yet efficient method that compresses visual
representations in the frequency domain. Our approach is motivated by the
observation that vision features output from the vision encoder exhibit
concentrated energy in low-frequency components. Leveraging this, we apply a
low-pass filter to the vision features using a two-dimentional Discrete Cosine
Transform (DCT). Notably, the DCT is efficiently computed via the Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT) operator with a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$,
minimizing the extra computational cost while introducing no additional
parameters. Extensive experiments across various image-based benchmarks
demonstrate that Fourier-VLM achieves competitive performance with strong
generalizability across both LLaVA and Qwen-VL architectures. Crucially, it
reduce inference FLOPs by up to 83.8% and boots generation speed by 31.2%
compared to LLaVA-v1.5, highlighting the superior efficiency and practicality.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于自回归图像生成的Next Editing-token Prediction (NEP)方法，仅编辑需要修改的图像区域，避免不必要的计算和非编辑区域的偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法生成整个目标图像，导致计算成本高且编辑质量受限。

Method: 采用自回归图像生成，预训练任意顺序的自回归文本到图像（T2I）模型，实现零样本图像编辑。

Result: 在广泛使用的图像编辑基准测试中达到最新水平，支持零样本迭代优化。

Conclusion: NEP方法高效且灵活，显著提升了图像编辑的质量和效率。

Abstract: Text-guided image editing involves modifying a source image based on a
language instruction and, typically, requires changes to only small local
regions. However, existing approaches generate the entire target image rather
than selectively regenerate only the intended editing areas. This results in
(1) unnecessary computational costs and (2) a bias toward reconstructing
non-editing regions, which compromises the quality of the intended edits. To
resolve these limitations, we propose to formulate image editing as Next
Editing-token Prediction (NEP) based on autoregressive image generation, where
only regions that need to be edited are regenerated, thus avoiding unintended
modification to the non-editing areas. To enable any-region editing, we propose
to pre-train an any-order autoregressive text-to-image (T2I) model. Once
trained, it is capable of zero-shot image editing and can be easily adapted to
NEP for image editing, which achieves a new state-of-the-art on widely used
image editing benchmarks. Moreover, our model naturally supports test-time
scaling (TTS) through iteratively refining its generation in a zero-shot
manner. The project page is: https://nep-bigai.github.io/

TL;DR: VQAThinker是一个基于推理的视频质量评估框架，利用大型多模态模型和强化学习解决现有模型的泛化性和可解释性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频质量评估模型在泛化性和可解释性方面存在不足，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 采用GRPO强化学习算法，结合三种奖励机制（回归、排序和时间一致性）模拟人类感知决策。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，泛化性强，且在质量描述和失真归因方面优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 强化学习为构建仅需分数级监督的泛化性和可解释性VQA模型提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) aims to objectively quantify perceptual
quality degradation in alignment with human visual perception. Despite recent
advances, existing VQA models still suffer from two critical limitations:
\textit{poor generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) videos} and
\textit{limited explainability}, which restrict their applicability in
real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose
\textbf{VQAThinker}, a reasoning-based VQA framework that leverages large
multimodal models (LMMs) with reinforcement learning to jointly model video
quality understanding and scoring, emulating human perceptual decision-making.
Specifically, we adopt group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a rule-guided
reinforcement learning algorithm that enables reasoning over video quality
under score-level supervision, and introduce three VQA-specific rewards: (1) a
\textbf{bell-shaped regression reward} that increases rapidly as the prediction
error decreases and becomes progressively less sensitive near the ground truth;
(2) a \textbf{pairwise ranking reward} that guides the model to correctly
determine the relative quality between video pairs; and (3) a \textbf{temporal
consistency reward} that encourages the model to prefer temporally coherent
videos over their perturbed counterparts. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VQAThinker achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and OOD
VQA benchmarks, showing strong generalization for video quality scoring.
Furthermore, evaluations on video quality understanding tasks validate its
superiority in distortion attribution and quality description compared to
existing explainable VQA models and LMMs. These findings demonstrate that
reinforcement learning offers an effective pathway toward building
generalizable and explainable VQA models solely with score-level supervision.

Motivation: 侧脑室（LV）形状分析作为神经系统疾病的生物标志物具有潜力，但由于个体间形状差异大和MRI分辨率限制导致的分割困难，仍存在挑战。

Method: LV-Net通过变形解剖学感知的联合LV-海马模板网格生成个性化3D LV网格，利用模板中的解剖关系减少分割伪影并增强点对应性。

Result: LV-Net在重建精度和形状描述符可靠性上表现优异，即使存在分割缺陷，且在阿尔茨海默病分析中识别出与疾病显著相关的LV子区域。

Conclusion: LV-Net为LV形状分析提供了更准确和可靠的工具，有助于神经系统疾病的研究和诊断。

Abstract: Lateral ventricle (LV) shape analysis holds promise as a biomarker for
neurological diseases; however, challenges remain due to substantial shape
variability across individuals and segmentation difficulties arising from
limited MRI resolution. We introduce LV-Net, a novel framework for producing
individualized 3D LV meshes from brain MRI by deforming an anatomy-aware joint
LV-hippocampus template mesh. By incorporating anatomical relationships
embedded within the joint template, LV-Net reduces boundary segmentation
artifacts and improves reconstruction robustness. In addition, by classifying
the vertices of the template mesh based on their anatomical adjacency, our
method enhances point correspondence across subjects, leading to more accurate
LV shape statistics. We demonstrate that LV-Net achieves superior
reconstruction accuracy, even in the presence of segmentation imperfections,
and delivers more reliable shape descriptors across diverse datasets. Finally,
we apply LV-Net to Alzheimer's disease analysis, identifying LV subregions that
show significantly associations with the disease relative to cognitively normal
controls. The codes for LV shape modeling are available at

Abstract: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is closer than ever to becoming a
reality, sparking widespread enthusiasm in the research community to collect
and work with various modalities, including text, image, video, and audio.
Despite recent efforts, satellite spectral imagery, as an additional modality,
has yet to receive the attention it deserves. This area presents unique
challenges, but also holds great promise in advancing the capabilities of AGI
in understanding the natural world. In this paper, we argue why Earth
Observation data is useful for an intelligent model, and then we review
existing benchmarks and highlight their limitations in evaluating the
generalization ability of foundation models in this domain. This paper
emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive benchmark to evaluate earth
observation models. To facilitate this, we propose a comprehensive set of tasks
that a benchmark should encompass to effectively assess a model's ability to
understand and interact with Earth observation data.

TL;DR: TSANet是一种轻量级的两阶段网络，通过状态空间增强的交叉注意力处理事件像素修复和去马赛克问题，在移动设备上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合Quad Bayer CFA传感器和事件像素时，去马赛克过程中会出现伪影和混叠问题，现有方法难以在资源有限的移动设备上解决这些问题。

Method: TSANet采用两阶段网络设计，分别处理事件像素修复和去马赛克，并引入轻量级Cross-Swin State Block，利用位置先验和状态空间模型增强全局依赖。

Result: TSANet在模拟和真实HybridEVS数据上表现优异，PSNR和SSIM优于现有方法DemosaicFormer，同时参数和计算成本分别降低1.86倍和3.29倍。

Conclusion: TSANet为移动设备上的高效图像去马赛克提供了新可能。

Abstract: Event cameras like the Hybrid Event-based Vision Sensor (HybridEVS) camera
capture brightness changes as asynchronous "events" instead of frames, offering
advanced application on mobile photography. However, challenges arise from
combining a Quad Bayer Color Filter Array (CFA) sensor with event pixels
lacking color information, resulting in aliasing and artifacts on the
demosaicing process before downstream application. Current methods struggle to
address these issues, especially on resource-limited mobile devices. In
response, we introduce \textbf{TSANet}, a lightweight \textbf{T}wo-stage
network via \textbf{S}tate space augmented cross-\textbf{A}ttention, which can
handle event pixels inpainting and demosaicing separately, leveraging the
benefits of dividing complex tasks into manageable subtasks. Furthermore, we
introduce a lightweight Cross-Swin State Block that uniquely utilizes
positional prior for demosaicing and enhances global dependencies through the
state space model with linear complexity. In summary, TSANet demonstrates
excellent demosaicing performance on both simulated and real data of HybridEVS
while maintaining a lightweight model, averaging better results than the
previous state-of-the-art method DemosaicFormer across seven diverse datasets
in both PSNR and SSIM, while respectively reducing parameter and computation
costs by $1.86\times$ and $3.29\times$. Our approach presents new possibilities
for efficient image demosaicing on mobile devices. Code is available in the
supplementary materials.

Motivation: 尽管SOD和COD任务具有矛盾属性，但作者认为通过正确方法可以实现联合学习，提升两者性能。

Method: 提出SCJoint联合学习方案，通过任务特定参数解耦矛盾属性，并设计SBSS策略平衡训练集。

Result: 实验证明JoNet网络能同时捕捉显著和伪装目标，性能优越。

Conclusion: 联合学习SOD和COD任务可行且有效，SCJoint和SBSS方法显著提升性能。

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) and camouflaged object detection (COD) are two
closely related but distinct computer vision tasks. Although both are
class-agnostic segmentation tasks that map from RGB space to binary space, the
former aims to identify the most salient objects in the image, while the latter
focuses on detecting perfectly camouflaged objects that blend into the
background in the image. These two tasks exhibit strong contradictory
attributes. Previous works have mostly believed that joint learning of these
two tasks would confuse the network, reducing its performance on both tasks.
However, here we present an opposite perspective: with the correct approach to
learning, the network can simultaneously possess the capability to find both
salient and camouflaged objects, allowing both tasks to benefit from joint
learning. We propose SCJoint, a joint learning scheme for SOD and COD tasks,
assuming that the decoding processes of SOD and COD have different distribution
characteristics. The key to our method is to learn the respective means and
variances of the decoding processes for both tasks by inserting a minimal
amount of task-specific learnable parameters within a fully shared network
structure, thereby decoupling the contradictory attributes of the two tasks at
a minimal cost. Furthermore, we propose a saliency-based sampling strategy
(SBSS) to sample the training set of the SOD task to balance the training set
sizes of the two tasks. In addition, SBSS improves the training set quality and
shortens the training time. Based on the proposed SCJoint and SBSS, we train a
powerful generalist network, named JoNet, which has the ability to
simultaneously capture both ``salient" and ``camouflaged". Extensive
experiments demonstrate the competitive performance and effectiveness of our
proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/linuxsino/JoNet.

Motivation: 现有基准测试无法提供直观、即时的性能差异反馈，BioMotion Arena旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用成对比较评估方法，收集了53个主流模型在90种生物运动变体上的45k+投票数据。

Result: 数据显示众包投票与专家评分高度一致，且90%以上模型无法生成基本的人形点光源组或流畅的生物运动。

Conclusion: BioMotion Arena是一个具有挑战性的性能可视化基准，无需依赖真实数据即可灵活评估模型。

Abstract: Evaluating the abilities of large models and manifesting their gaps are
challenging. Current benchmarks adopt either ground-truth-based score-form
evaluation on static datasets or indistinct textual chatbot-style human
preferences collection, which may not provide users with immediate, intuitive,
and perceptible feedback on performance differences. In this paper, we
introduce BioMotion Arena, a novel framework for evaluating large language
models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) via visual
animation. Our methodology draws inspiration from the inherent visual
perception of motion patterns characteristic of living organisms that utilizes
point-light source imaging to amplify the performance discrepancies between
models. Specifically, we employ a pairwise comparison evaluation and collect
more than 45k votes for 53 mainstream LLMs and MLLMs on 90 biological motion
variants. Data analyses show that the crowd-sourced human votes are in good
agreement with those of expert raters, demonstrating the superiority of our
BioMotion Arena in offering discriminative feedback. We also find that over
90\% of evaluated models, including the cutting-edge open-source InternVL3 and
proprietary Claude-4 series, fail to produce fundamental humanoid point-light
groups, much less smooth and biologically plausible motions. This enables
BioMotion Arena to serve as a challenging benchmark for performance
visualization and a flexible evaluation framework without restrictions on
ground-truth.

Motivation: 当前TD治疗方法依赖低分辨率MRI和外科直觉，导致结果不一致且微创技术应用有限。

Method: 使用隐式神经表示（INR）生成超分辨率MRI，多标签网络分割骨骼，小波扩散模型（WDM）生成伪健康目标形态。

Result: 在25例TD患者中验证，显著改善了滑车角度（SA）和滑车沟深度（TGD）。

Conclusion: 该方法无需CT，减少辐射，为术前规划提供了高分辨率3D形态，优于现有方法。

Abstract: To treat Trochlear Dysplasia (TD), current approaches rely mainly on
low-resolution clinical Magnetic Resonance (MR) scans and surgical intuition.
The surgeries are planned based on surgeons experience, have limited adoption
of minimally invasive techniques, and lead to inconsistent outcomes. We propose
a pipeline that generates super-resolved, patient-specific 3D pseudo-healthy
target morphologies from conventional clinical MR scans. First, we compute an
isotropic super-resolved MR volume using an Implicit Neural Representation
(INR). Next, we segment femur, tibia, patella, and fibula with a multi-label
custom-trained network. Finally, we train a Wavelet Diffusion Model (WDM) to
generate pseudo-healthy target morphologies of the trochlear region. In
contrast to prior work producing pseudo-healthy low-resolution 3D MR images,
our approach enables the generation of sub-millimeter resolved 3D shapes
compatible for pre- and intraoperative use. These can serve as preoperative
blueprints for reshaping the femoral groove while preserving the native patella
articulation. Furthermore, and in contrast to other work, we do not require a
CT for our pipeline - reducing the amount of radiation. We evaluated our
approach on 25 TD patients and could show that our target morphologies
significantly improve the sulcus angle (SA) and trochlear groove depth (TGD).

Motivation: 指令式编辑因其简单高效的交互形式具有巨大潜力，但视频编辑因训练数据不足而受限。

Method: 提出两阶段训练策略（先图像后视频）和两种数据合成方法（拼贴和生成模型），并设计高效编辑框架。

Result: DreamVE在关键编辑类型上表现优异，泛化和迁移能力强，但属性编辑性能稍逊。

Conclusion: DreamVE通过统一框架和多源数据训练，显著提升了指令式编辑的实用性和效果。

Abstract: Instruction-based editing holds vast potential due to its simple and
efficient interactive editing format. However, instruction-based editing,
particularly for video, has been constrained by limited training data,
hindering its practical application. To this end, we introduce DreamVE, a
unified model for instruction-based image and video editing. Specifically, We
propose a two-stage training strategy: first image editing, then video editing.
This offers two main benefits: (1) Image data scales more easily, and models
are more efficient to train, providing useful priors for faster and better
video editing training. (2) Unifying image and video generation is natural and
aligns with current trends. Moreover, we present comprehensive training data
synthesis pipelines, including collage-based and generative model-based data
synthesis. The collage-based data synthesis combines foreground objects and
backgrounds to generate diverse editing data, such as object manipulation,
background changes, and text modifications. It can easily generate billions of
accurate, consistent, realistic, and diverse editing pairs. We pretrain DreamVE
on extensive collage-based data to achieve strong performance in key editing
types and enhance generalization and transfer capabilities. However,
collage-based data lacks some attribute editing cases, leading to a relative
drop in performance. In contrast, the generative model-based pipeline, despite
being hard to scale up, offers flexibility in handling attribute editing cases.
Therefore, we use generative model-based data to further fine-tune DreamVE.
Besides, we design an efficient and powerful editing framework for DreamVE. We
build on the SOTA T2V model and use a token concatenation with early drop
approach to inject source image guidance, ensuring strong consistency and
editability. The codes and models will be released.

Result: 在OpenVid-1M基准测试中，SwiftVideo在少步视频生成中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SwiftVideo通过统一框架解决了少步推理的性能问题，实现了高效高质量的视频生成。

Abstract: Diffusion-based or flow-based models have achieved significant progress in
video synthesis but require multiple iterative sampling steps, which incurs
substantial computational overhead. While many distillation methods that are
solely based on trajectory-preserving or distribution-matching have been
developed to accelerate video generation models, these approaches often suffer
from performance breakdown or increased artifacts under few-step settings. To
address these limitations, we propose \textbf{\emph{SwiftVideo}}, a unified and
stable distillation framework that combines the advantages of
trajectory-preserving and distribution-matching strategies. Our approach
introduces continuous-time consistency distillation to ensure precise
preservation of ODE trajectories. Subsequently, we propose a dual-perspective
alignment that includes distribution alignment between synthetic and real data
along with trajectory alignment across different inference steps. Our method
maintains high-quality video generation while substantially reducing the number
of inference steps. Quantitative evaluations on the OpenVid-1M benchmark
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in
few-step video generation.

Motivation: 现有剪枝方法未能充分利用推理过程中的动态内部信号，导致效率不足。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B上，CUDA延迟降低61.3%，平均精度保持92.9%。

Conclusion: AdaptInfer是一种轻量级、即插即用的高效剪枝方法，在多模态任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance on
multimodal reasoning tasks such as visual question answering (VQA), but their
inference cost remains a significant challenge due to the large number of
vision tokens processed during the prefill stage. Existing pruning methods
often rely on directly using the attention patterns or static text prompt
guidance, failing to exploit the dynamic internal signals generated during
inference. To address these issues, we propose AdaptInfer, a plug-and-play
framework for adaptive vision token pruning in VLMs. First, we introduce a
fine-grained, dynamic text-guided pruning mechanism that reuses layer-wise
text-to-text attention maps to construct soft priors over text-token
importance, allowing more informed scoring of vision tokens at each stage.
Second, we perform an offline analysis of cross-modal attention shifts and
identify consistent inflection locations in inference, which inspire us to
propose a more principled and efficient pruning schedule. Our method is
lightweight and plug-and-play, also generalizable across multi-modal tasks.
Experimental results have verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.
For example, it reduces CUDA latency by 61.3\% while maintaining an average
accuracy of 92.9\% on vanilla LLaVA-1.5-7B. Under the same token budget,
AdaptInfer surpasses SOTA in accuracy.

TL;DR: Q-CLIP是一个基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的视频质量评估（VQA）框架，通过共享跨模态适配器（SCMA）和可学习质量提示，显著降低计算成本并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VQA方法依赖大规模预训练数据集，存在语义知识迁移不足和计算资源消耗大的问题。VLM在视觉任务中表现出色，但尚未充分应用于VQA。

Method: 提出Q-CLIP框架，利用SCMA增强视觉和文本表示，仅需训练少量参数；引入可学习质量提示提升模型对视频质量的敏感性；研究帧采样策略。

Result: Q-CLIP在多个VQA数据集上表现优异，计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: Q-CLIP为VQA提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案，展示了VLM在质量评估中的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient Video Quality Assessment (VQA) has long been a key
research challenge. Current mainstream VQA methods typically improve
performance by pretraining on large-scale classification datasets (e.g.,
ImageNet, Kinetics-400), followed by fine-tuning on VQA datasets. However, this
strategy presents two significant challenges: (1) merely transferring semantic
knowledge learned from pretraining is insufficient for VQA, as video quality
depends on multiple factors (e.g., semantics, distortion, motion, aesthetics);
(2) pretraining on large-scale datasets demands enormous computational
resources, often dozens or even hundreds of times greater than training
directly on VQA datasets. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown
remarkable generalization capabilities across a wide range of visual tasks, and
have begun to demonstrate promising potential in quality assessment. In this
work, we propose Q-CLIP, the first fully VLMs-based framework for VQA. Q-CLIP
enhances both visual and textual representations through a Shared Cross-Modal
Adapter (SCMA), which contains only a minimal number of trainable parameters
and is the only component that requires training. This design significantly
reduces computational cost. In addition, we introduce a set of five learnable
quality-level prompts to guide the VLMs in perceiving subtle quality
variations, thereby further enhancing the model's sensitivity to video quality.
Furthermore, we investigate the impact of different frame sampling strategies
on VQA performance, and find that frame-difference-based sampling leads to
better generalization performance across datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Q-CLIP exhibits excellent performance on several VQA datasets.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能生成多样且自然的反应动作，适用于情感驱动的交互任务。

Abstract: Emotion serves as an essential component in daily human interactions.
Existing human motion generation frameworks do not consider the impact of
emotions, which reduces naturalness and limits their application in interactive
tasks, such as human reaction synthesis. In this work, we introduce a novel
task: generating diverse reaction motions in response to different emotional
cues. However, learning emotion representation from limited motion data and
incorporating it into a motion generation framework remains a challenging
problem. To address the above obstacles, we introduce a semi-supervised emotion
prior in an actor-reactor diffusion model to facilitate emotion-driven reaction
synthesis. Specifically, based on the observation that motion clips within a
short sequence tend to share the same emotion, we first devise a
semi-supervised learning framework to train an emotion prior. With this prior,
we further train an actor-reactor diffusion model to generate reactions by
considering both spatial interaction and emotional response. Finally, given a
motion sequence of an actor, our approach can generate realistic reactions
under various emotional conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our
model outperforms existing reaction generation methods. The code and data will
be made publicly available at https://ereact.github.io/

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字时代中，高级图像编辑工具威胁视觉内容的真实性，而现有IML方法依赖大规模标注数据，但数据集规模与多样性不足限制了模型性能。

Method: 提出UGD-IML框架，利用扩散模型学习数据分布，通过类嵌入机制和参数共享设计，实现IML和CIML任务的统一处理。

Result: 在多个数据集上，UGD-IML在IML和CIML任务中的F1指标分别平均优于现有方法9.66和4.36，且在不确定性估计、可视化和鲁棒性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: UGD-IML通过生成式方法解决了数据标注效率问题，为图像篡改检测提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In the digital age, advanced image editing tools pose a serious threat to the
integrity of visual content, making image forgery detection and localization a
key research focus. Most existing Image Manipulation Localization (IML) methods
rely on discriminative learning and require large, high-quality annotated
datasets. However, current datasets lack sufficient scale and diversity,
limiting model performance in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, recent
studies have explored Constrained IML (CIML), which generates pixel-level
annotations through algorithmic supervision. However, existing CIML approaches
often depend on complex multi-stage pipelines, making the annotation process
inefficient. In this work, we propose a novel generative framework based on
diffusion models, named UGD-IML, which for the first time unifies both IML and
CIML tasks within a single framework. By learning the underlying data
distribution, generative diffusion models inherently reduce the reliance on
large-scale labeled datasets, allowing our approach to perform effectively even
under limited data conditions. In addition, by leveraging a class embedding
mechanism and a parameter-sharing design, our model seamlessly switches between
IML and CIML modes without extra components or training overhead. Furthermore,
the end-to-end design enables our model to avoid cumbersome steps in the data
annotation process. Extensive experimental results on multiple datasets
demonstrate that UGD-IML outperforms the SOTA methods by an average of 9.66 and
4.36 in terms of F1 metrics for IML and CIML tasks, respectively. Moreover, the
proposed method also excels in uncertainty estimation, visualization and
robustness.

Motivation: 现有方法在噪声标签条件下容易过拟合，且缺乏跨模态一致性建模，需要更鲁棒的解决方案。

Result: MCA在传统和噪声3D基准测试中均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: MCA框架具有通用性和有效性，显著提升了跨模态检索的鲁棒性。

Abstract: With the increasing availability of 2D and 3D data, significant advancements
have been made in the field of cross-modal retrieval. Nevertheless, the
existence of imperfect annotations presents considerable challenges, demanding
robust solutions for 2D-3D cross-modal retrieval in the presence of noisy label
conditions. Existing methods generally address the issue of noise by dividing
samples independently within each modality, making them susceptible to
overfitting on corrupted labels. To address these issues, we propose a robust
2D-3D \textbf{M}ulti-level cross-modal adaptive \textbf{C}orrection and
\textbf{A}lignment framework (MCA). Specifically, we introduce a Multimodal
Joint label Correction (MJC) mechanism that leverages multimodal historical
self-predictions to jointly model the modality prediction consistency, enabling
reliable label refinement. Additionally, we propose a Multi-level Adaptive
Alignment (MAA) strategy to effectively enhance cross-modal feature semantics
and discrimination across different levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority of our method, MCA, which achieves state-of-the-art performance
on both conventional and realistic noisy 3D benchmarks, highlighting its
generality and effectiveness.

Conclusion: 自监督学习框架和渐进注意力机制显著提升了手写数学表达式识别的性能，减少了标注数据依赖。

Abstract: Recognizing handwritten mathematical expressions (HMER) is a challenging task
due to the inherent two-dimensional structure, varying symbol scales, and
complex spatial relationships among symbols. In this paper, we present a
self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for HMER that eliminates the need for
expensive labeled data. Our approach begins by pretraining an image encoder
using a combination of global and local contrastive loss, enabling the model to
learn both holistic and fine-grained representations. A key contribution of
this work is a novel self-supervised attention network, which is trained using
a progressive spatial masking strategy. This attention mechanism is designed to
learn semantically meaningful focus regions, such as operators, exponents, and
nested mathematical notation, without requiring any supervision. The
progressive masking curriculum encourages the network to become increasingly
robust to missing or occluded visual information, ultimately improving
structural understanding. Our complete pipeline consists of (1) self-supervised
pretraining of the encoder, (2) self-supervised attention learning, and (3)
supervised fine-tuning with a transformer decoder to generate LATEX sequences.
Extensive experiments on CROHME benchmarks demonstrate that our method
outperforms existing SSL and fully supervised baselines, validating the
effectiveness of our progressive attention mechanism in enhancing HMER
performance. Our codebase can be found here.

TL;DR: FMCE-Net++是一个新的训练框架，通过整合预训练的FMCE-Net作为辅助头，动态平衡分类损失和特征收敛优化，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度神经网络（DNNs）内部表示不透明的问题，并改进现有FMCE方法缺乏实验验证和闭环集成的局限性。

Method: 提出FMCE-Net++框架，利用预训练的FMCE-Net生成特征图收敛分数（FMCS），结合任务标签通过表示辅助损失（RAL）监督主干网络优化。

Result: 在多个数据集（MNIST、CIFAR-10等）上验证，FMCE-Net++显著提升模型性能，如ResNet-50在CIFAR-10上准确率提升1.16个百分点。

Conclusion: FMCE-Net++无需修改架构或额外数据即可有效提升模型性能，验证了其在优化特征收敛方面的有效性。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) face interpretability challenges due to their
opaque internal representations. While Feature Map Convergence Evaluation
(FMCE) quantifies module-level convergence via Feature Map Convergence Scores
(FMCS), it lacks experimental validation and closed-loop integration. To
address this limitation, we propose FMCE-Net++, a novel training framework that
integrates a pretrained, frozen FMCE-Net as an auxiliary head. This module
generates FMCS predictions, which, combined with task labels, jointly supervise
backbone optimization through a Representation Auxiliary Loss. The RAL
dynamically balances the primary classification loss and feature convergence
optimization via a tunable \Representation Abstraction Factor. Extensive
experiments conducted on MNIST, CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-100
demonstrate that FMCE-Net++ consistently enhances model performance without
architectural modifications or additional data. Key experimental outcomes
include accuracy gains of $+1.16$ pp (ResNet-50/CIFAR-10) and $+1.08$ pp
(ShuffleNet v2/CIFAR-100), validating that FMCE-Net++ can effectively elevate
state-of-the-art performance ceilings.

TL;DR: GMF-Drive提出了一种基于门控Mamba融合的端到端自动驾驶框架，通过几何增强的LiDAR表示和高效的空间感知状态空间模型，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散模型的自动驾驶方法受限于Transformer融合的二次计算复杂性和缺乏空间先验，无法有效建模BEV表示。

Method: 采用几何增强的LiDAR表示和门控Mamba融合架构（GM-Fusion），替代Transformer，利用状态空间模型（SSM）实现线性复杂度的长程依赖建模。

Result: 在NAVSIM基准测试中，GMF-Drive性能显著优于DiffusionDrive，达到新的SOTA。

Conclusion: 任务特定的SSM在自动驾驶中优于通用Transformer，证明了GMF-Drive在性能和效率上的优势。

Abstract: Diffusion-based models are redefining the state-of-the-art in end-to-end
autonomous driving, yet their performance is increasingly hampered by a
reliance on transformer-based fusion. These architectures face fundamental
limitations: quadratic computational complexity restricts the use of
high-resolution features, and a lack of spatial priors prevents them from
effectively modeling the inherent structure of Bird's Eye View (BEV)
representations. This paper introduces GMF-Drive (Gated Mamba Fusion for
Driving), an end-to-end framework that overcomes these challenges through two
principled innovations. First, we supersede the information-limited
histogram-based LiDAR representation with a geometrically-augmented pillar
format encoding shape descriptors and statistical features, preserving critical
3D geometric details. Second, we propose a novel hierarchical gated mamba
fusion (GM-Fusion) architecture that substitutes an expensive transformer with
a highly efficient, spatially-aware state-space model (SSM). Our core BEV-SSM
leverages directional sequencing and adaptive fusion mechanisms to capture
long-range dependencies with linear complexity, while explicitly respecting the
unique spatial properties of the driving scene. Extensive experiments on the
challenging NAVSIM benchmark demonstrate that GMF-Drive achieves a new
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming DiffusionDrive.
Comprehensive ablation studies validate the efficacy of each component,
demonstrating that task-specific SSMs can surpass a general-purpose transformer
in both performance and efficiency for autonomous driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放词汇语义分割因类别广泛和细粒度而具有挑战性，现有弱监督方法存在语义不对齐和性能不佳的问题。

Method: 采用MCCL策略结合类别内外对齐与分离，并通过FSS重构判别性特征，避免视觉编码器引入的前景偏差。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，如VOC提升4.5%，Context提升8.9%。

Conclusion: SynSeg有效提升了弱监督下的语义定位和区分能力，具有显著性能优势。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in open-vocabulary scenarios presents significant
challenges due to the wide range and granularity of semantic categories.
Existing weakly-supervised methods often rely on category-specific supervision
and ill-suited feature construction methods for contrastive learning, leading
to semantic misalignment and poor performance. In this work, we propose a novel
weakly-supervised approach, SynSeg, to address the challenges. SynSeg performs
Multi-Category Contrastive Learning (MCCL) as a stronger training signal with a
new feature reconstruction framework named Feature Synergy Structure (FSS).
Specifically, MCCL strategy robustly combines both intra- and inter-category
alignment and separation in order to make the model learn the knowledge of
correlations from different categories within the same image. Moreover, FSS
reconstructs discriminative features for contrastive learning through prior
fusion and semantic-activation-map enhancement, effectively avoiding the
foreground bias introduced by the visual encoder. In general, SynSeg
effectively improves the abilities in semantic localization and discrimination
under weak supervision. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. For instance,
SynSeg achieves higher accuracy than SOTA baselines by 4.5\% on VOC, 8.9\% on
Context, 2.6\% on Object and 2.0\% on City.

Motivation: 探索不同表示学习算法在卫星图像天气事件分类中的表现，以提升分类效果。

Method: 比较了PCA、CAE和预训练残差网络（PT）在天气事件分类中的表现，并分析了潜在空间大小和分辨率的影响。

Result: CAE在所有分类任务中表现最佳，PCA高命中率但高误报率，PT在热带气旋识别中表现突出。高分辨率数据对深度学习算法更有利。

Conclusion: CAE高效有效，但需结合物理信息以提升解释性，未来可开发物理信息版本的CAE。

Abstract: This study applied representation learning algorithms to satellite images and
evaluated the learned latent spaces with classifications of various weather
events. The algorithms investigated include the classical linear
transformation, i.e., principal component analysis (PCA), state-of-the-art deep
learning method, i.e., convolutional autoencoder (CAE), and a residual network
pre-trained with large image datasets (PT). The experiment results indicated
that the latent space learned by CAE consistently showed higher threat scores
for all classification tasks. The classifications with PCA yielded high hit
rates but also high false-alarm rates. In addition, the PT performed
exceptionally well at recognizing tropical cyclones but was inferior in other
tasks. Further experiments suggested that representations learned from
higher-resolution datasets are superior in all classification tasks for
deep-learning algorithms, i.e., CAE and PT. We also found that smaller latent
space sizes had minor impact on the classification task's hit rate. Still, a
latent space dimension smaller than 128 caused a significantly higher false
alarm rate. Though the CAE can learn latent spaces effectively and efficiently,
the interpretation of the learned representation lacks direct connections to
physical attributions. Therefore, developing a physics-informed version of CAE
can be a promising outlook for the current work.

Conclusion: SC-Captioner通过自我修正机制和精细的奖励设计，提升了图像描述的质量。

Abstract: We propose SC-Captioner, a reinforcement learning framework that enables the
self-correcting capability of image caption models. Our crucial technique lies
in the design of the reward function to incentivize accurate caption
corrections. Specifically, the predicted and reference captions are decomposed
into object, attribute, and relation sets using scene-graph parsing algorithms.
We calculate the set difference between sets of initial and self-corrected
captions to identify added and removed elements. These elements are matched
against the reference sets to calculate correctness bonuses for accurate
refinements and mistake punishments for wrong additions and removals, thereby
forming the final reward. For image caption quality assessment, we propose a
set of metrics refined from CAPTURE that alleviate its incomplete precision
evaluation and inefficient relation matching problems. Furthermore, we collect
a fine-grained annotated image caption dataset, RefinedCaps, consisting of 6.5K
diverse images from COCO dataset. Experiments show that applying SC-Captioner
on large visual-language models can generate better image captions across
various scenarios, significantly outperforming the direct preference
optimization training strategy.

Conclusion: 模块化和多样化图表生成方法有效提升了MLLMs的图表理解能力，ECD数据集为未来研究提供了高质量资源。

Abstract: Being able to effectively read scientific plots, or chart understanding, is a
central part toward building effective agents for science. However, existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially open-source ones, are
still falling behind with a typical success rate of 30%-50% on challenging
benchmarks. Previous studies on fine-tuning MLLMs with synthetic charts are
often restricted by their inadequate similarity to the real charts, which could
compromise model training and performance on complex real-world charts. In this
study, we show that modularizing chart generation and diversifying visual
details improves chart understanding capabilities. In particular, we design a
five-step data synthesis pipeline, where we separate data and function creation
for single plot generation, condition the generation of later subplots on
earlier ones for multi-subplot figures, visually diversify the generated
figures, filter out low quality data, and finally generate the question-answer
(QA) pairs with GPT-4o. This approach allows us to streamline the generation of
fine-tuning datasets and introduce the effective chart dataset (ECD), which
contains 10k+ chart images and 300k+ QA pairs, covering 25 topics and featuring
250+ chart type combinations with high visual complexity. We show that ECD
consistently improves the performance of various MLLMs on a range of real-world
and synthetic test sets. Code, data and models are available at:

Motivation: SAM的零样本能力虽强，但其潜在漏洞可能导致下游应用失败，因此需要主动评估这些可迁移的漏洞。

Method: VeSCA通过参数化单纯复形显式表征SAM与下游模型的共享脆弱区域，并通过迭代顶点细化识别这些复形。

Result: 实验表明，VeSCa在五个领域数据集上性能提升12.7%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了SAM漏洞对下游模型的风险，强调了开发更鲁棒基础模型的紧迫性。

Abstract: While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) transforms interactive segmentation
with zero-shot abilities, its inherent vulnerabilities present a single-point
risk, potentially leading to the failure of numerous downstream applications.
Proactively evaluating these transferable vulnerabilities is thus imperative.
Prior adversarial attacks on SAM often present limited transferability due to
insufficient exploration of common weakness across domains. To address this, we
propose Vertex-Refining Simplicial Complex Attack (VeSCA), a novel method that
leverages only the encoder of SAM for generating transferable adversarial
examples. Specifically, it achieves this by explicitly characterizing the
shared vulnerable regions between SAM and downstream models through a
parametric simplicial complex. Our goal is to identify such complexes within
adversarially potent regions by iterative vertex-wise refinement. A lightweight
domain re-adaptation strategy is introduced to bridge domain divergence using
minimal reference data during the initialization of simplicial complex.
Ultimately, VeSCA generates consistently transferable adversarial examples
through random simplicial complex sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VeSCA achieves performance improved by 12.7% compared to state-of-the-art
methods across three downstream model categories across five domain-specific
datasets. Our findings further highlight the downstream model risks posed by
SAM's vulnerabilities and emphasize the urgency of developing more robust
foundation models.

Abstract: We propose a novel 3D gaze redirection framework that leverages an explicit
3D eyeball structure. Existing gaze redirection methods are typically based on
neural radiance fields, which employ implicit neural representations via volume
rendering. Unlike these NeRF-based approaches, where the rotation and
translation of 3D representations are not explicitly modeled, we introduce a
dedicated 3D eyeball structure to represent the eyeballs with 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS). Our method generates photorealistic images that faithfully
reproduce the desired gaze direction by explicitly rotating and translating the
3D eyeball structure. In addition, we propose an adaptive deformation module
that enables the replication of subtle muscle movements around the eyes.
Through experiments conducted on the ETH-XGaze dataset, we demonstrate that our
framework is capable of generating diverse novel gaze images, achieving
superior image quality and gaze estimation accuracy compared to previous
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Combining sparse IMUs and a monocular camera is a new promising setting to
perform real-time human motion capture. This paper proposes a diffusion-based
solution to learn human motion priors and fuse the two modalities of signals
together seamlessly in a unified framework. By delicately considering the
characteristics of the two signals, the sequential visual information is
considered as a whole and transformed into a condition embedding, while the
inertial measurement is concatenated with the noisy body pose frame by frame to
construct a sequential input for the diffusion model. Firstly, we observe that
the visual information may be unavailable in some frames due to occlusions or
subjects moving out of the camera view. Thus incorporating the sequential
visual features as a whole to get a single feature embedding is robust to the
occasional degenerations of visual information in those frames. On the other
hand, the IMU measurements are robust to occlusions and always stable when
signal transmission has no problem. So incorporating them frame-wisely could
better explore the temporal information for the system. Experiments have
demonstrated the effectiveness of the system design and its state-of-the-art
performance in pose estimation compared with the previous works. Our codes are

Motivation: 现有数据集可能因MLLM的快速发展而过时，且易受数据污染影响，需要一种动态评估方法。

Method: 采用文本、图像及文本-图像动态策略生成新样本，分析其对模型安全性的影响。

Result: SDEval显著影响安全评估，缓解数据污染，并暴露MLLMs的安全局限性。

Conclusion: SDEval是一个通用的动态评估框架，适用于现有安全和能力基准。

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), the safety concerns of their outputs have earned significant
attention. Although numerous datasets have been proposed, they may become
outdated with MLLM advancements and are susceptible to data contamination
issues. To address these problems, we propose \textbf{SDEval}, the
\textit{first} safety dynamic evaluation framework to controllably adjust the
distribution and complexity of safety benchmarks. Specifically, SDEval mainly
adopts three dynamic strategies: text, image, and text-image dynamics to
generate new samples from original benchmarks. We first explore the individual
effects of text and image dynamics on model safety. Then, we find that
injecting text dynamics into images can further impact safety, and conversely,
injecting image dynamics into text also leads to safety risks. SDEval is
general enough to be applied to various existing safety and even capability
benchmarks. Experiments across safety benchmarks, MLLMGuard and VLSBench, and
capability benchmarks, MMBench and MMVet, show that SDEval significantly
influences safety evaluation, mitigates data contamination, and exposes safety
limitations of MLLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/hq-King/SDEval

Motivation: 解决多模态视觉模型中晚期特征融合和查询选择的不足，以及固定词汇表的限制。

Method: 1. 早期融合机制统一文本/视觉提示和主干特征；2. 顺序对齐查询选择优化文本与视觉查询的结构对齐；3. 生成数据引擎通过双路径交叉验证减少标签噪声。

Result: Prompt-DINO在开放世界检测基准中达到领先性能，语义覆盖范围显著扩大。

Conclusion: Prompt-DINO为开放世界场景中的可扩展多模态检测和数据生成建立了新范式。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal vision models have highlighted limitations
in late-stage feature fusion and suboptimal query selection for hybrid prompts
open-world segmentation, alongside constraints from caption-derived
vocabularies. To address these challenges, we propose Prompt-DINO, a
text-guided visual Prompt DINO framework featuring three key innovations.
First, we introduce an early fusion mechanism that unifies text/visual prompts
and backbone features at the initial encoding stage, enabling deeper
cross-modal interactions to resolve semantic ambiguities. Second, we design
order-aligned query selection for DETR-based architectures, explicitly
optimizing the structural alignment between text and visual queries during
decoding to enhance semantic-spatial consistency. Third, we develop a
generative data engine powered by the Recognize Anything via Prompting (RAP)
model, which synthesizes 0.5B diverse training instances through a dual-path
cross-verification pipeline, reducing label noise by 80.5% compared to
conventional approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Prompt-DINO
achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-world detection benchmarks while
significantly expanding semantic coverage beyond fixed-vocabulary constraints.
Our work establishes a new paradigm for scalable multimodal detection and data
generation in open-world scenarios. Data&Code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多依赖标准卷积，而自适应卷积能更好地利用遥感图像的像素相关性。

Method: 动态分割卷积核并结合注意力机制，选择感兴趣位置，将原始卷积核分割为多个小核。

Result: DSConv显著提升了特征提取能力，实验证明其性能和泛化能力优越。

Conclusion: DSConv在图像融合任务中表现出色，具有最优使用条件和广泛适用性。

Abstract: Aiming to obtain a high-resolution image, pansharpening involves the fusion
of a multi-spectral image (MS) and a panchromatic image (PAN), the low-level
vision task remaining significant and challenging in contemporary research.
Most existing approaches rely predominantly on standard convolutions, few
making the effort to adaptive convolutions, which are effective owing to the
inter-pixel correlations of remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a
novel strategy for dynamically splitting convolution kernels in conjunction
with attention, selecting positions of interest, and splitting the original
convolution kernel into multiple smaller kernels, named DSConv. The proposed
DSConv more effectively extracts features of different positions within the
receptive field, enhancing the network's generalization, optimization, and
feature representation capabilities. Furthermore, we innovate and enrich
concepts of dynamic splitting convolution and provide a novel network
architecture for pansharpening capable of achieving the tasks more efficiently,
building upon this methodology. Adequate fair experiments illustrate the
effectiveness and the state-of-the-art performance attained by
DSConv.Comprehensive and rigorous discussions proved the superiority and
optimal usage conditions of DSConv.

TL;DR: VISTAR是一个用户中心的多维度文本到图像（T2I）评估基准，结合确定性指标和新型分层加权P/N提问方案（HWPQ），显著提升了评估准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文本到图像评估指标的局限性，提供更全面的评估方法。

Method: 采用两阶段混合范式：确定性指标量化物理属性，HWPQ方案评估抽象语义。基于专家研究定义用户角色和评估角度。

Result: VISTAR在人类对齐性上表现优异（>75%），HWPQ在抽象语义评估中达到85.9%准确率。评估显示没有通用最优模型，角色加权分数为领域部署提供指导。

Conclusion: VISTAR为T2I评估提供了更准确和可操作的基准，所有资源已公开以促进可重复性。

Abstract: We present VISTAR, a user-centric, multi-dimensional benchmark for
text-to-image (T2I) evaluation that addresses the limitations of existing
metrics. VISTAR introduces a two-tier hybrid paradigm: it employs
deterministic, scriptable metrics for physically quantifiable attributes (e.g.,
text rendering, lighting) and a novel Hierarchical Weighted P/N Questioning
(HWPQ) scheme that uses constrained vision-language models to assess abstract
semantics (e.g., style fusion, cultural fidelity). Grounded in a Delphi study
with 120 experts, we defined seven user roles and nine evaluation angles to
construct the benchmark, which comprises 2,845 prompts validated by over 15,000
human pairwise comparisons. Our metrics achieve high human alignment (>75%),
with the HWPQ scheme reaching 85.9% accuracy on abstract semantics,
significantly outperforming VQA baselines. Comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art models reveals no universal champion, as role-weighted scores
reorder rankings and provide actionable guidance for domain-specific
deployment. All resources are publicly released to foster reproducible T2I
assessment.

Method: 结合多平面融合（MPF）和KANSC注意力机制，并行提取多平面特征并精确识别病变区域。

Result: 在ADNI数据集上表现优异，并发现AD进展中右脑皮层结构变化的侧向不对称性。

Conclusion: MPF-KANSC框架显著提升了AD诊断性能，并具有较高的可解释性。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that
severely impairs cognitive function and quality of life. Timely intervention in
AD relies heavily on early and precise diagnosis, which remains challenging due
to the complex and subtle structural changes in the brain. Most existing deep
learning methods focus only on a single plane of structural magnetic resonance
imaging (sMRI) and struggle to accurately capture the complex and nonlinear
relationships among pathological regions of the brain, thus limiting their
ability to precisely identify atrophic features. To overcome these limitations,
we propose an innovative framework, MPF-KANSC, which integrates multi-plane
fusion (MPF) for combining features from the coronal, sagittal, and axial
planes, and a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-guided spatial-channel attention
mechanism (KANSC) to more effectively learn and represent sMRI atrophy
features. Specifically, the proposed model enables parallel feature extraction
from multiple anatomical planes, thus capturing more comprehensive structural
information. The KANSC attention mechanism further leverages a more flexible
and accurate nonlinear function approximation technique, facilitating precise
identification and localization of disease-related abnormalities. Experiments
on the ADNI dataset confirm that the proposed MPF-KANSC achieves superior
performance in AD diagnosis. Moreover, our findings provide new evidence of
right-lateralized asymmetry in subcortical structural changes during AD
progression, highlighting the model's promising interpretability.

Method: 提出PostDiff框架，包括混合分辨率去噪（早期步骤降低分辨率）和模块级缓存策略，以减少冗余计算。

Result: 实验表明，PostDiff显著提升了扩散模型的效率与生成质量平衡，且降低单步计算成本比减少去噪步骤更有效。

Conclusion: PostDiff为预训练扩散模型的高效部署提供了可行的解决方案，尤其在资源受限场景下表现突出。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable success across generative tasks, yet
their high computational demands challenge deployment on resource-limited
platforms. This paper investigates a critical question for compute-optimal
diffusion model deployment: Under a post-training setting without fine-tuning,
is it more effective to reduce the number of denoising steps or to use a
cheaper per-step inference? Intuitively, reducing the number of denoising steps
increases the variability of the distributions across steps, making the model
more sensitive to compression. In contrast, keeping more denoising steps makes
the differences smaller, preserving redundancy, and making post-training
compression more feasible. To systematically examine this, we propose PostDiff,
a training-free framework for accelerating pre-trained diffusion models by
reducing redundancy at both the input level and module level in a post-training
manner. At the input level, we propose a mixed-resolution denoising scheme
based on the insight that reducing generation resolution in early denoising
steps can enhance low-frequency components and improve final generation
fidelity. At the module level, we employ a hybrid module caching strategy to
reuse computations across denoising steps. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies demonstrate that (1) PostDiff can significantly improve the
fidelity-efficiency trade-off of state-of-the-art diffusion models, and (2) to
boost efficiency while maintaining decent generation fidelity, reducing
per-step inference cost is often more effective than reducing the number of
denoising steps. Our code is available at

Motivation: 传统方法（如NeRF及其扩展）在水下环境中因光线吸收、散射和浑浊问题导致几何和颜色保真度下降，且效率受限。

Method: 提出UW-3DGS框架，结合可学习的水下图像形成模块和物理感知不确定性修剪（PAUP），优化高斯分布并去除噪声。

Conclusion: UW-3DGS通过物理建模和自适应修剪，实现了高效且高保真的水下3D重建。

Abstract: Underwater 3D scene reconstruction faces severe challenges from light
absorption, scattering, and turbidity, which degrade geometry and color
fidelity in traditional methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). While NeRF
extensions such as SeaThru-NeRF incorporate physics-based models, their MLP
reliance limits efficiency and spatial resolution in hazy environments. We
introduce UW-3DGS, a novel framework adapting 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for
robust underwater reconstruction. Key innovations include: (1) a plug-and-play
learnable underwater image formation module using voxel-based regression for
spatially varying attenuation and backscatter; and (2) a Physics-Aware
Uncertainty Pruning (PAUP) branch that adaptively removes noisy floating
Gaussians via uncertainty scoring, ensuring artifact-free geometry. The
pipeline operates in training and rendering stages. During training, noisy
Gaussians are optimized end-to-end with underwater parameters, guided by PAUP
pruning and scattering modeling. In rendering, refined Gaussians produce clean
Unattenuated Radiance Images (URIs) free from media effects, while learned
physics enable realistic Underwater Images (UWIs) with accurate light
transport. Experiments on SeaThru-NeRF and UWBundle datasets show superior
performance, achieving PSNR of 27.604, SSIM of 0.868, and LPIPS of 0.104 on
SeaThru-NeRF, with ~65% reduction in floating artifacts.

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，为城市公共安全风险预警提供了有效解决方案。

Conclusion: MA-CBP框架在犯罪行为预测和公共安全预警方面具有显著潜力。

Abstract: With the acceleration of urbanization, criminal behavior in public scenes
poses an increasingly serious threat to social security. Traditional anomaly
detection methods based on feature recognition struggle to capture high-level
behavioral semantics from historical information, while generative approaches
based on Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to meet real-time
requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MA-CBP, a criminal
behavior prediction framework based on multi-agent asynchronous collaboration.
This framework transforms real-time video streams into frame-level semantic
descriptions, constructs causally consistent historical summaries, and fuses
adjacent image frames to perform joint reasoning over long- and short-term
contexts. The resulting behavioral decisions include key elements such as event
subjects, locations, and causes, enabling early warning of potential criminal
activity. In addition, we construct a high-quality criminal behavior dataset
that provides multi-scale language supervision, including frame-level,
summary-level, and event-level semantic annotations. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on multiple datasets
and offers a promising solution for risk warning in urban public safety
scenarios.

Motivation: 胸水CT图像语义分割在临床诊断中至关重要，但现有方法难以处理灰度相似、边缘模糊和形态多变等问题。

Method: 设计了双域特征解耦模块（DDFD）和分支交互注意力融合模块（BIAF），结合嵌套深度监督机制，实现多尺度特征互补和动态加权融合。

Conclusion: DBIF-AUNet显著优化了复杂胸水CT图像的分割准确性，为临床诊断提供了更可靠的辅助工具。

Abstract: Pleural effusion semantic segmentation can significantly enhance the accuracy
and timeliness of clinical diagnosis and treatment by precisely identifying
disease severity and lesion areas. Currently, semantic segmentation of pleural
effusion CT images faces multiple challenges. These include similar gray levels
between effusion and surrounding tissues, blurred edges, and variable
morphology. Existing methods often struggle with diverse image variations and
complex edges, primarily because direct feature concatenation causes semantic
gaps. To address these challenges, we propose the Dual-Branch Interactive
Fusion Attention model (DBIF-AUNet). This model constructs a densely nested
skip-connection network and innovatively refines the Dual-Domain Feature
Disentanglement module (DDFD). The DDFD module orthogonally decouples the
functions of dual-domain modules to achieve multi-scale feature complementarity
and enhance characteristics at different levels. Concurrently, we design a
Branch Interaction Attention Fusion module (BIAF) that works synergistically
with the DDFD. This module dynamically weights and fuses global, local, and
frequency band features, thereby improving segmentation robustness.
Furthermore, we implement a nested deep supervision mechanism with hierarchical
adaptive hybrid loss to effectively address class imbalance. Through validation
on 1,622 pleural effusion CT images from Southwest Hospital, DBIF-AUNet
achieved IoU and Dice scores of 80.1% and 89.0% respectively. These results
outperform state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models U-Net++ and
Swin-UNet by 5.7%/2.7% and 2.2%/1.5% respectively, demonstrating significant
optimization in segmentation accuracy for complex pleural effusion CT images.

TL;DR: LiLoRA是一种高效的架构扩展方法，用于解决多模态大语言模型在持续视觉指令调整中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续视觉指令调整（CVIT）中，灾难性遗忘导致模型在适应新任务时遗忘旧任务性能。现有方法参数开销大且扩展性差。

Method: LiLoRA通过共享LoRA矩阵A、对矩阵B进行低秩分解以减少任务特定参数，并引入余弦正则化稳定性损失保持共享表示一致性。

Result: 实验表明，LiLoRA在连续任务学习中表现优异，且参数效率显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LiLoRA为CVIT提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Continual Visual Instruction Tuning (CVIT) enables Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) to incrementally learn new tasks over time. However, this
process is challenged by catastrophic forgetting, where performance on
previously learned tasks deteriorates as the model adapts to new ones. A common
approach to mitigate forgetting is architecture expansion, which introduces
task-specific modules to prevent interference. Yet, existing methods often
expand entire layers for each task, leading to significant parameter overhead
and poor scalability. To overcome these issues, we introduce LoRA in LoRA
(LiLoRA), a highly efficient architecture expansion method tailored for CVIT in
MLLMs. LiLoRA shares the LoRA matrix A across tasks to reduce redundancy,
applies an additional low-rank decomposition to matrix B to minimize
task-specific parameters, and incorporates a cosine-regularized stability loss
to preserve consistency in shared representations over time. Extensive
experiments on a diverse CVIT benchmark show that LiLoRA consistently achieves
superior performance in sequential task learning while significantly improving
parameter efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Result: 在8个数据集上表现优异，显著超越专用方法。

Conclusion: AnomalyMoE是一种通用且高效的异常检测框架，适用于多种领域和模态。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a critical task across numerous domains and modalities,
yet existing methods are often highly specialized, limiting their
generalizability. These specialized models, tailored for specific anomaly types
like textural defects or logical errors, typically exhibit limited performance
when deployed outside their designated contexts. To overcome this limitation,
we propose AnomalyMoE, a novel and universal anomaly detection framework based
on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Our key insight is to decompose the
complex anomaly detection problem into three distinct semantic hierarchies:
local structural anomalies, component-level semantic anomalies, and global
logical anomalies. AnomalyMoE correspondingly employs three dedicated expert
networks at the patch, component, and global levels, and is specialized in
reconstructing features and identifying deviations at its designated semantic
level. This hierarchical design allows a single model to concurrently
understand and detect a wide spectrum of anomalies. Furthermore, we introduce
an Expert Information Repulsion (EIR) module to promote expert diversity and an
Expert Selection Balancing (ESB) module to ensure the comprehensive utilization
of all experts. Experiments on 8 challenging datasets spanning industrial
imaging, 3D point clouds, medical imaging, video surveillance, and logical
anomaly detection demonstrate that AnomalyMoE establishes new state-of-the-art
performance, significantly outperforming specialized methods in their
respective domains.

Abstract: The Human-Object Interaction (HOI) task explores the dynamic interactions
between humans and objects in physical environments, providing essential
biomechanical and cognitive-behavioral foundations for fields such as robotics,
virtual reality, and human-computer interaction. However, existing HOI data
sets focus on details of affordance, often neglecting the influence of physical
properties of objects on human long-term motion. To bridge this gap, we
introduce the PA-HOI Motion Capture dataset, which highlights the impact of
objects' physical attributes on human motion dynamics, including human posture,
moving velocity, and other motion characteristics. The dataset comprises 562
motion sequences of human-object interactions, with each sequence performed by
subjects of different genders interacting with 35 3D objects that vary in size,
shape, and weight. This dataset stands out by significantly extending the scope
of existing ones for understanding how the physical attributes of different
objects influence human posture, speed, motion scale, and interacting
strategies. We further demonstrate the applicability of the PA-HOI dataset by
integrating it with existing motion generation methods, validating its capacity
to transfer realistic physical awareness.

the inefficiency of manual scoring, this work proposes a two-stage pipeline for
interpretable image-level SvdH score prediction using dual-hand radiographs.
Our approach extracts disease-relevant image regions and integrates them using
attention-based multiple instance learning to generate image-level features for
prediction. We propose two region extraction schemes: 1) sampling image tiles
most likely to contain abnormalities, and 2) cropping patches containing
disease-relevant joints. With Scheme 2, our best individual score prediction
model achieved a Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.943 and a root
mean squared error (RMSE) of 15.73. Ensemble learning further boosted
prediction accuracy, yielding a PCC of 0.945 and RMSE of 15.57, achieving
state-of-the-art performance that is comparable to that of experienced
radiologists (PCC = 0.97, RMSE = 18.75). Finally, our pipeline effectively
identified and made decisions based on anatomical structures which clinicians
consider relevant to RA progression.

TL;DR: 提出了一种纹理感知和边缘引导的Transformer（TEFormer），用于解决城市遥感图像语义分割中的纹理差异和边缘模糊问题，取得了较高的分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市遥感图像中的地理对象纹理差异小、空间结构相似，易导致语义模糊和误分类，同时不规则形状和模糊边界增加了分割难度。

Method: 设计了纹理感知模块（TaM）捕捉纹理差异，构建边缘引导三分支解码器（Eg3Head）保留边缘细节，并通过边缘引导特征融合模块（EgFFM）融合上下文与边缘信息。

Result: 在Potsdam、Vaihingen和LoveDA数据集上分别达到88.57%、81.46%和53.55%的mIoU。

Conclusion: TEFormer通过纹理感知和边缘引导机制，有效提升了城市遥感图像的语义分割精度。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of urban remote sensing images (URSIs) is crucial for
applications such as urban planning and environmental monitoring. However,
geospatial objects often exhibit subtle texture differences and similar spatial
structures, which can easily lead to semantic ambiguity and misclassification.
Moreover, challenges such as irregular object shapes, blurred boundaries, and
overlapping spatial distributions of semantic objects contribute to complex and
diverse edge morphologies, further complicating accurate segmentation. To
tackle these issues, we propose a texture-aware and edge-guided Transformer
(TEFormer) that integrates texture awareness and edge-guidance mechanisms for
semantic segmentation of URSIs. In the encoder, a texture-aware module (TaM) is
designed to capture fine-grained texture differences between visually similar
categories to enhance semantic discrimination. Then, an edge-guided tri-branch
decoder (Eg3Head) is constructed to preserve local edges and details for
multiscale context-awareness. Finally, an edge-guided feature fusion module
(EgFFM) is to fuse contextual and detail information with edge information to
realize refined semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments show that TEFormer
achieves mIoU of 88.57%, 81.46%, and 53.55% on the Potsdam, Vaihingen, and
LoveDA datasets, respectively, shows the effectiveness in URSI semantic
segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统增强技术忽略了深度感知变换，限制了模型在真实世界深度变化中的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用自适应深度偏移技术，基于深度方差阈值生成合成深度扰动，同时保持结构完整性。

Result: 在FathomNet和UTDAC2020数据集上验证了Depth-Jitter对模型稳定性的提升，尤其在深度敏感环境中表现突出。

Conclusion: Depth-Jitter虽未在所有情况下超越传统方法，但显著提升了模型在深度变化环境中的稳定性和泛化能力，为深度感知增强技术提供了新思路。

Abstract: Depth information is essential in computer vision, particularly in underwater
imaging, robotics, and autonomous navigation. However, conventional
augmentation techniques overlook depth aware transformations, limiting model
robustness in real world depth variations. In this paper, we introduce
Depth-Jitter, a novel depth-based augmentation technique that simulates natural
depth variations to improve generalization. Our approach applies adaptive depth
offsetting, guided by depth variance thresholds, to generate synthetic depth
perturbations while preserving structural integrity. We evaluate Depth-Jitter
on two benchmark datasets, FathomNet and UTDAC2020 demonstrating its impact on
model stability under diverse depth conditions. Extensive experiments compare
Depth-Jitter against traditional augmentation strategies such as ColorJitter,
analyzing performance across varying learning rates, encoders, and loss
functions. While Depth-Jitter does not always outperform conventional methods
in absolute performance, it consistently enhances model stability and
generalization in depth-sensitive environments. These findings highlight the
potential of depth-aware augmentation for real-world applications and provide a
foundation for further research into depth-based learning strategies. The
proposed technique is publicly available to support advancements in depth-aware
augmentation. The code is publicly available on

Abstract: Image deblurring, removing blurring artifacts from images, is a fundamental
task in computational photography and low-level computer vision. Existing
approaches focus on specialized solutions tailored to particular blur types,
thus, these solutions lack generalization. This limitation in current methods
implies requiring multiple models to cover several blur types, which is not
practical in many real scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the first
all-in-one deblurring method capable of efficiently restoring images affected
by diverse blur degradations, including global motion, local motion, blur in
low-light conditions, and defocus blur. We propose a mixture-of-experts (MoE)
decoding module, which dynamically routes image features based on the
recognized blur degradation, enabling precise and efficient restoration in an
end-to-end manner. Our unified approach not only achieves performance
comparable to dedicated task-specific models, but also demonstrates remarkable
robustness and generalization capabilities on unseen blur degradation
scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种参数高效的方法LNCLIP-DF，通过微调预训练CLIP模型的层归一化参数（仅0.03%），并结合L2归一化和潜在空间增强，实现了对未见过的深度伪造技术的鲁棒泛化。


<details>

Motivation: 深度伪造检测器在应对未见过的伪造技术时泛化能力不足，现有方法通常引入复杂架构，而本文旨在通过参数高效的调整实现鲁棒泛化。

Method: 仅微调CLIP模型的层归一化参数，并结合L2归一化和潜在空间增强，形成超球面特征流形。

Result: 在13个基准数据集上评估，LNCLIP-DF表现优于复杂方法，平均跨数据集AUROC达到最优。研究发现：1）使用同一源视频的真实-伪造配对数据训练可避免捷径学习；2）学术数据集的检测难度并未随时间增加。

Conclusion: 通过最小化调整预训练CLIP模型，实现了高效的深度伪造检测泛化能力，代码将公开。

Abstract: The generalization of deepfake detectors to unseen manipulation techniques
remains a challenge for practical deployment. Although many approaches adapt
foundation models by introducing significant architectural complexity, this
work demonstrates that robust generalization is achievable through a
parameter-efficient adaptation of a pre-trained CLIP vision encoder. The
proposed method, LNCLIP-DF, fine-tunes only the Layer Normalization parameters
(0.03% of the total) and enhances generalization by enforcing a hyperspherical
feature manifold using L2 normalization and latent space augmentations.
  We conducted an extensive evaluation on 13 benchmark datasets spanning from
2019 to 2025. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming more complex, recent approaches in average cross-dataset AUROC.
Our analysis yields two primary findings for the field: 1) training on paired
real-fake data from the same source video is essential for mitigating shortcut
learning and improving generalization, and 2) detection difficulty on academic
datasets has not strictly increased over time, with models trained on older,
diverse datasets showing strong generalization capabilities.
  This work delivers a computationally efficient and reproducible method,
proving that state-of-the-art generalization is attainable by making targeted,
minimal changes to a pre-trained CLIP model. The code will be made publicly
available upon acceptance.

Motivation: 解决复杂域偏移（如地理偏移）中现有方法表现不佳的问题，利用语言模态的鲁棒性改进视觉模型适应。

Conclusion: TRUST通过结合语言模态和不确定性估计，显著提升了复杂域偏移下的适应能力。

Abstract: Recent unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have shown great success
in addressing classical domain shifts (e.g., synthetic-to-real), but they still
suffer under complex shifts (e.g. geographical shift), where both the
background and object appearances differ significantly across domains. Prior
works showed that the language modality can help in the adaptation process,
exhibiting more robustness to such complex shifts. In this paper, we introduce
TRUST, a novel UDA approach that exploits the robustness of the language
modality to guide the adaptation of a vision model. TRUST generates
pseudo-labels for target samples from their captions and introduces a novel
uncertainty estimation strategy that uses normalised CLIP similarity scores to
estimate the uncertainty of the generated pseudo-labels. Such estimated
uncertainty is then used to reweight the classification loss, mitigating the
adverse effects of wrong pseudo-labels obtained from low-quality captions. To
further increase the robustness of the vision model, we propose a multimodal
soft-contrastive learning loss that aligns the vision and language feature
spaces, by leveraging captions to guide the contrastive training of the vision
model on target images. In our contrastive loss, each pair of images acts as
both a positive and a negative pair and their feature representations are
attracted and repulsed with a strength proportional to the similarity of their
captions. This solution avoids the need for hardly determining positive and
negative pairs, which is critical in the UDA setting. Our approach outperforms
previous methods, setting the new state-of-the-art on classical (DomainNet) and
complex (GeoNet) domain shifts. The code will be available upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在遥感图像分类中面临通信开销大的问题，FedX旨在通过剪枝减少模型传输量。

Method: 利用反向传播解释方法评估模型组件的重要性，剪枝最不相关的部分，生成稀疏全局模型。

Result: 在BigEarthNet-S2和EuroSAT数据集上验证，FedX显著减少了共享参数数量并提升了模型泛化能力。

Conclusion: FedX成功降低了通信开销，同时优于未剪枝模型和其他先进剪枝方法。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables the collaborative training of deep neural
networks across decentralized data archives (i.e., clients), where each client
stores data locally and only shares model updates with a central server. This
makes FL a suitable learning paradigm for remote sensing (RS) image
classification tasks, where data centralization may be restricted due to legal
and privacy constraints. However, a key challenge in applying FL to RS tasks is
the communication overhead caused by the frequent exchange of large model
updates between clients and the central server. To address this issue, in this
paper we propose a novel strategy (denoted as FedX) that uses
explanation-guided pruning to reduce communication overhead by minimizing the
size of the transmitted models without compromising performance. FedX leverages
backpropagation-based explanation methods to estimate the task-specific
importance of model components and prunes the least relevant ones at the
central server. The resulting sparse global model is then sent to clients,
substantially reducing communication overhead. We evaluate FedX on multi-label
scene classification using the BigEarthNet-S2 dataset and single-label scene
classification using the EuroSAT dataset. Experimental results show the success
of FedX in significantly reducing the number of shared model parameters while
enhancing the generalization capability of the global model, compared to both
unpruned model and state-of-the-art pruning methods. The code of FedX will be
available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/FedX.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of femur structures from Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(MRI) is critical for orthopedic diagnosis and surgical planning but remains
challenging due to the limitations of existing 2D and 3D deep learning-based
segmentation approaches. In this study, we propose XAG-Net, a novel 2.5D
U-Net-based architecture that incorporates pixel-wise cross-slice attention
(CSA) and skip attention gating (AG) mechanisms to enhance inter-slice
contextual modeling and intra-slice feature refinement. Unlike previous
CSA-based models, XAG-Net applies pixel-wise softmax attention across adjacent
slices at each spatial location for fine-grained inter-slice modeling.
Extensive evaluations demonstrate that XAG-Net surpasses baseline 2D, 2.5D, and
3D U-Net models in femur segmentation accuracy while maintaining computational
efficiency. Ablation studies further validate the critical role of the CSA and
AG modules, establishing XAG-Net as a promising framework for efficient and
accurate femur MRI segmentation.

Result: 实验表明，SIFThinker在空间理解和细粒度视觉感知任务中优于现有方法，同时保持通用能力。

Conclusion: SIFThinker通过动态注意力修正和区域聚焦，显著提升了复杂视觉任务的性能。

Abstract: Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still face significant
challenges in complex visual tasks (e.g., spatial understanding, fine-grained
perception). Prior methods have tried to incorporate visual reasoning, however,
they fail to leverage attention correction with spatial cues to iteratively
refine their focus on prompt-relevant regions. In this paper, we introduce
SIFThinker, a spatially-aware "think-with-images" framework that mimics human
visual perception. Specifically, SIFThinker enables attention correcting and
image region focusing by interleaving depth-enhanced bounding boxes and natural
language. Our contributions are twofold: First, we introduce a
reverse-expansion-forward-inference strategy that facilitates the generation of
interleaved image-text chains of thought for process-level supervision, which
in turn leads to the construction of the SIF-50K dataset. Besides, we propose
GRPO-SIF, a reinforced training paradigm that integrates depth-informed visual
grounding into a unified reasoning pipeline, teaching the model to dynamically
correct and focus on prompt-relevant regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SIFThinker outperforms state-of-the-art methods in spatial understanding
and fine-grained visual perception, while maintaining strong general
capabilities, highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: WGAST是一种弱监督生成网络，用于通过融合Terra MODIS、Landsat 8和Sentinel-2数据，实现每日10米分辨率的地表温度（LST）估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市化、气候变化和农业压力增加了对环境监测的需求，而现有遥感系统在空间和时间分辨率之间存在权衡。

Method: 采用条件生成对抗网络架构，包括特征提取、融合、LST重建和噪声抑制四个阶段，并结合弱监督训练策略。

Result: WGAST在定量和定性评估中均优于现有方法，平均降低RMSE 17.18%，提高SSIM 11.00%，并能有效捕捉细尺度热模式。

Conclusion: WGAST是首个端到端深度学习框架，为高分辨率LST估计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Urbanization, climate change, and agricultural stress are increasing the
demand for precise and timely environmental monitoring. Land Surface
Temperature (LST) is a key variable in this context and is retrieved from
remote sensing satellites. However, these systems face a trade-off between
spatial and temporal resolution. While spatio-temporal fusion methods offer
promising solutions, few have addressed the estimation of daily LST at 10 m
resolution. In this study, we present WGAST, a Weakly-Supervised Generative
Network for Daily 10 m LST Estimation via Spatio-Temporal Fusion of Terra
MODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2. WGAST is the first end-to-end deep learning
framework designed for this task. It adopts a conditional generative
adversarial architecture, with a generator composed of four stages: feature
extraction, fusion, LST reconstruction, and noise suppression. The first stage
employs a set of encoders to extract multi-level latent representations from
the inputs, which are then fused in the second stage using cosine similarity,
normalization, and temporal attention mechanisms. The third stage decodes the
fused features into high-resolution LST, followed by a Gaussian filter to
suppress high-frequency noise. Training follows a weakly supervised strategy
based on physical averaging principles and reinforced by a PatchGAN
discriminator. Experiments demonstrate that WGAST outperforms existing methods
in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Compared to the
best-performing baseline, on average, WGAST reduces RMSE by 17.18% and improves
SSIM by 11.00%. Furthermore, WGAST is robust to cloud-induced LST and
effectively captures fine-scale thermal patterns, as validated against 33
ground-based sensors. The code is available at

Result: 在三个数据集和六种跨域设置中，URPA仅需少量无标注视频即可实现良好泛化。

Conclusion: URPA无需目标域标注，计算和存储开销低，适用于实时部署。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (TG) aims to temporally locate video segments
matching a natural language description (a query) in a long video. While
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are effective at holistic semantic matching, they
often struggle with fine-grained temporal localisation. Recently, Group
Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO) reformulates the inference process as a
reinforcement learning task, enabling fine-grained grounding and achieving
strong in-domain performance. However, GRPO relies on labelled data, making it
unsuitable in unlabelled domains. Moreover, because videos are large and
expensive to store and process, performing full-scale adaptation introduces
prohibitive latency and computational overhead, making it impractical for
real-time deployment. To overcome both problems, we introduce a Data-Efficient
Unlabelled Cross-domain Temporal Grounding method, from which a model is first
trained on a labelled source domain, then adapted to a target domain using only
a small number of unlabelled videos from the target domain. This approach
eliminates the need for target annotation and keeps both computational and
storage overhead low enough to run in real time. Specifically, we introduce.
Uncertainty-quantified Rollout Policy Adaptation (URPA) for cross-domain
knowledge transfer in learning video temporal grounding without target labels.
URPA generates multiple candidate predictions using GRPO rollouts, averages
them to form a pseudo label, and estimates confidence from the variance across
these rollouts. This confidence then weights the training rewards, guiding the
model to focus on reliable supervision. Experiments on three datasets across
six cross-domain settings show that URPA generalises well using only a few
unlabelled target videos. Codes will be released once published.

Result: 在UCF-Crime数据集上达到91.58%的AUC，并在XD-Violence和MSAD数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: GS-MoE通过类别特异性专家和时序引导，为弱监督视频异常检测设定了新基准。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is a challenging task due to the variability of
anomalous events and the limited availability of labeled data. Under the
Weakly-Supervised VAD (WSVAD) paradigm, only video-level labels are provided
during training, while predictions are made at the frame level. Although
state-of-the-art models perform well on simple anomalies (e.g., explosions),
they struggle with complex real-world events (e.g., shoplifting). This
difficulty stems from two key issues: (1) the inability of current models to
address the diversity of anomaly types, as they process all categories with a
shared model, overlooking category-specific features; and (2) the weak
supervision signal, which lacks precise temporal information, limiting the
ability to capture nuanced anomalous patterns blended with normal events. To
address these challenges, we propose Gaussian Splatting-guided Mixture of
Experts (GS-MoE), a novel framework that employs a set of expert models, each
specialized in capturing specific anomaly types. These experts are guided by a
temporal Gaussian splatting loss, enabling the model to leverage temporal
consistency and enhance weak supervision. The Gaussian splatting approach
encourages a more precise and comprehensive representation of anomalies by
focusing on temporal segments most likely to contain abnormal events. The
predictions from these specialized experts are integrated through a
mixture-of-experts mechanism to model complex relationships across diverse
anomaly patterns. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a
91.58% AUC on the UCF-Crime dataset, and demonstrates superior results on
XD-Violence and MSAD datasets. By leveraging category-specific expertise and
temporal guidance, GS-MoE sets a new benchmark for VAD under weak supervision.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了域偏移问题，减少了对迁移学习的需求，特别适用于数据稀缺场景。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, including cardiac MR, is prone to domain
shift due to variations in imaging devices and acquisition protocols. This
challenge limits the deployment of trained AI models in real-world scenarios,
where performance degrades on unseen domains. Traditional solutions involve
increasing the size of the dataset through ad-hoc image augmentation or
additional online training/transfer learning, which have several limitations.
Synthetic data offers a promising alternative, but anatomical/structural
consistency constraints limit the effectiveness of generative models in
creating image-label pairs. To address this, we propose a diffusion model (DM)
trained on a source domain that generates synthetic cardiac MR images that
resemble a given reference. The synthetic data maintains spatial and structural
fidelity, ensuring similarity to the source domain and compatibility with the
segmentation mask. We assess the utility of our generative approach in
multi-centre cardiac MR segmentation, using the 2D nnU-Net, 3D nnU-Net and
vanilla U-Net segmentation networks. We explore domain generalisation, where,
domain-invariant segmentation models are trained on synthetic source domain
data, and domain adaptation, where, we shift target domain data towards the
source domain using the DM. Both strategies significantly improved segmentation
performance on data from an unseen target domain, in terms of surface-based
metrics (Welch's t-test, p < 0.01), compared to training segmentation models on
real data alone. The proposed method ameliorates the need for transfer learning
or online training to address domain shift challenges in cardiac MR image
analysis, especially useful in data-scarce settings.

Conclusion: 改进后的ViPro模型解决了原模型的局限性，提升了在复杂动态环境中的适用性。

Abstract: Predicting future video frames is a challenging task with many downstream
applications. Previous work has shown that procedural knowledge enables deep
models for complex dynamical settings, however their model ViPro assumed a
given ground truth initial symbolic state. We show that this approach led to
the model learning a shortcut that does not actually connect the observed
environment with the predicted symbolic state, resulting in the inability to
estimate states given an observation if previous states are noisy. In this
work, we add several improvements to ViPro that enables the model to correctly
infer states from observations without providing a full ground truth state in
the beginning. We show that this is possible in an unsupervised manner, and
extend the original Orbits dataset with a 3D variant to close the gap to real
world scenarios.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注行人数量而非社会互动质量，本研究旨在通过街景图像提取潜在社会信息，验证其与城市规划和居民情感的关联。

Method: 分析15个城市的2,998张街景图像，结合Mehta的社会性分类理论，使用线性回归模型控制天气、时间等因素，验证社会性指标与城市依恋分数及环境变量的关系。

Result: 天空视野指数与三种社会性类型相关，绿色视野指数预测持久社会性，城市依恋与短暂社会性正相关。

Conclusion: 街景图像可量化社会互动与建成环境的关系，为跨文化理论验证和社会活力城市设计提供工具。

Abstract: Designing socially active streets has long been a goal of urban planning, yet
existing quantitative research largely measures pedestrian volume rather than
the quality of social interactions. We hypothesize that street view imagery --
an inexpensive data source with global coverage -- contains latent social
information that can be extracted and interpreted through established social
science theory. As a proof of concept, we analyzed 2,998 street view images
from 15 cities using a multimodal large language model guided by Mehta's
taxonomy of passive, fleeting, and enduring sociability -- one illustrative
example of a theory grounded in urban design that could be substituted or
complemented by other sociological frameworks. We then used linear regression
models, controlling for factors like weather, time of day, and pedestrian
counts, to test whether the inferred sociability measures correlate with
city-level place attachment scores from the World Values Survey and with
environmental predictors (e.g., green, sky, and water view indices) derived
from individual street view images. Results aligned with long-standing urban
planning theory: the sky view index was associated with all three sociability
types, the green view index predicted enduring sociability, and place
attachment was positively associated with fleeting sociability. These results
provide preliminary evidence that street view images can be used to infer
relationships between specific types of social interactions and built
environment variables. Further research could establish street view imagery as
a scalable, privacy-preserving tool for studying urban sociability, enabling
cross-cultural theory testing and evidence-based design of socially vibrant
cities.

Motivation: 现有MLLM在处理视频异常事件时因时空稀疏性和冗余信息导致效果不佳，需要改进。

Result: VA-GPT在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VA-GPT通过高效时空信息捕捉和专用数据集，显著提升了视频异常事件分析的准确性。

Abstract: Understanding abnormal events in videos is a vital and challenging task that
has garnered significant attention in a wide range of applications. Although
current video understanding Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are
capable of analyzing general videos, they often struggle to handle anomalies
due to the spatial and temporal sparsity of abnormal events, where the
redundant information always leads to suboptimal outcomes. To address these
challenges, exploiting the representation and generalization capabilities of
Vison Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose
VA-GPT, a novel MLLM designed for summarizing and localizing abnormal events in
various videos. Our approach efficiently aligns effective tokens between visual
encoders and LLMs through two key proposed modules: Spatial Effective Token
Selection (SETS) and Temporal Effective Token Generation (TETG). These modules
enable our model to effectively capture and analyze both spatial and temporal
information associated with abnormal events, resulting in more accurate
responses and interactions. Furthermore, we construct an instruction-following
dataset specifically for fine-tuning video-anomaly-aware MLLMs, and introduce a
cross-domain evaluation benchmark based on XD-Violence dataset. Our proposed
method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on various benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文实现了Goldstein等人提出的两阶段图像分割算法，改进了Chan-Vese能量模型，并详细记录了其性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标是高效地将2D图像分割为前景和背景区域，假设像素值可由两个不同平均值概括且边界平滑。

Method: 通过改进Chan-Vese能量模型，利用split Bregman方法高效最小化能量，实现两阶段分割。

Result: 算法在不同参数下对多幅图像进行了测试，性能表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效实现图像分割，且效率较高。

Abstract: In this paper, we describe an implementation of the two-phase image
segmentation algorithm proposed by Goldstein, Bresson, Osher in
\cite{gold:bre}. This algorithm partitions the domain of a given 2d image into
foreground and background regions, and each pixel of the image is assigned
membership to one of these two regions. The underlying assumption for the
segmentation model is that the pixel values of the input image can be
summarized by two distinct average values, and that the region boundaries are
smooth. Accordingly, the model is defined as an energy in which the variable is
a region membership function to assign pixels to either region, originally
proposed by Chan and Vese in \cite{chan:vese}. This energy is the sum of image
data terms in the regions and a length penalty for region boundaries.
Goldstein, Bresson, Osher modify the energy of Chan-Vese in \cite{gold:bre} so
that their new energy can be minimized efficiently using the split Bregman
method to produce an equivalent two-phase segmentation. We provide a detailed
implementation of this method \cite{gold:bre}, and document its performance
with several images over a range of algorithm parameters.

Result: 实验证明方法适用于多种图像质量，且在不同人口统计组中表现一致。

Conclusion: 新方法能有效减少误识别，且仅在使用高级损失函数训练的匹配器中有效。

Abstract: A central problem in one-to-many facial identification is that the person in
the probe image may or may not have enrolled image(s) in the gallery; that is,
may be In-gallery or Out-of-gallery. Past approaches to detect when a rank-one
result is Out-of-gallery have mostly focused on finding a suitable threshold on
the similarity score. We take a new approach, using the additional enrolled
images of the identity with the rank-one result to predict if the rank-one
result is In-gallery / Out-of-gallery. Given a gallery of identities and
images, we generate In-gallery and Out-of-gallery training data by extracting
the ranks of additional enrolled images corresponding to the rank-one identity.
We then train a classifier to utilize this feature vector to predict whether a
rank-one result is In-gallery or Out-of-gallery. Using two different datasets
and four different matchers, we present experimental results showing that our
approach is viable for mugshot quality probe images, and also, importantly, for
probes degraded by blur, reduced resolution, atmospheric turbulence and
sunglasses. We also analyze results across demographic groups, and show that
In-gallery / Out-of-gallery classification accuracy is similar across
demographics. Our approach has the potential to provide an objective estimate
of whether a one-to-many facial identification is Out-of-gallery, and thereby
to reduce false positive identifications, wrongful arrests, and wasted
investigative time. Interestingly, comparing the results of older deep
CNN-based face matchers with newer ones suggests that the effectiveness of our
Out-of-gallery detection approach emerges only with matchers trained using
advanced margin-based loss functions.

Abstract: The integration of prompt tuning with multimodal learning has shown
significant generalization abilities for various downstream tasks. Despite
advancements, existing methods heavily depend on massive modality-specific
labeled data (e.g., video, audio, and image), or are customized for a single
modality. In this study, we present Text as Any-Modality by Consistent Prompt
Tuning (TaAM-CPT), a scalable approach for constructing a general
representation model toward unlimited modalities using solely text data.
TaAM-CPT comprises modality prompt pools, text construction, and
modality-aligned text encoders from pre-trained models, which allows for
extending new modalities by simply adding prompt pools and modality-aligned
text encoders. To harmonize the learning across different modalities, TaAM-CPT
designs intra- and inter-modal learning objectives, which can capture category
details within modalities while maintaining semantic consistency across
different modalities. Benefiting from its scalable architecture and pre-trained
models, TaAM-CPT can be seamlessly extended to accommodate unlimited
modalities. Remarkably, without any modality-specific labeled data, TaAM-CPT
achieves leading results on diverse datasets spanning various modalities,
including video classification, image classification, and audio classification.

Conclusion: FVGen显著提升了稀疏输入视角下3D重建任务的时间效率。

Abstract: Recent progress in 3D reconstruction has enabled realistic 3D models from
dense image captures, yet challenges persist with sparse views, often leading
to artifacts in unseen areas. Recent works leverage Video Diffusion Models
(VDMs) to generate dense observations, filling the gaps when only sparse views
are available for 3D reconstruction tasks. A significant limitation of these
methods is their slow sampling speed when using VDMs. In this paper, we present
FVGen, a novel framework that addresses this challenge by enabling fast novel
view synthesis using VDMs in as few as four sampling steps. We propose a novel
video diffusion model distillation method that distills a multi-step denoising
teacher model into a few-step denoising student model using Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) and softened reverse KL-divergence minimization.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that, compared to previous
works, our framework generates the same number of novel views with similar (or
even better) visual quality while reducing sampling time by more than 90%.
FVGen significantly improves time efficiency for downstream reconstruction
tasks, particularly when working with sparse input views (more than 2) where
pre-trained VDMs need to be run multiple times to achieve better spatial
coverage.

Abstract: High-resolution imagery plays a critical role in improving the performance of
visual recognition tasks such as classification, detection, and segmentation.
In many domains, including remote sensing and surveillance, low-resolution
images can limit the accuracy of automated analysis. To address this,
super-resolution (SR) techniques have been widely adopted to attempt to
reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs. Related
traditional approaches focus solely on enhancing image quality based on
pixel-level metrics, leaving the relationship between super-resolved image
fidelity and downstream classification performance largely underexplored. This
raises a key question: can integrating classification objectives directly into
the super-resolution process further improve classification accuracy? In this
paper, we try to respond to this question by investigating the relationship
between super-resolution and classification through the deployment of a
specialised algorithmic strategy. We propose a novel methodology that increases
the resolution of synthetic aperture radar imagery by optimising loss functions
that account for both image quality and classification performance. Our
approach improves image quality, as measured by scientifically ascertained
image quality indicators, while also enhancing classification accuracy.

Abstract: SAR ship classification faces the challenge of long-tailed datasets, which
complicates the classification of underrepresented classes. Oversampling
methods have proven effective in addressing class imbalance in optical data. In
this paper, we evaluated the effect of oversampling in the feature space for
SAR ship classification. We propose two novel algorithms inspired by the

Additionally, we also analyzed the impact of oversampling methods on different

Conclusion: 为高标注成本的医学影像应用提供了实用解决方案，支持极少量标签数据下的鲁棒分类。

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized medical imaging, but its effectiveness is
severely limited by insufficient labeled training data. This paper introduces a
novel GAN-based semi-supervised learning framework specifically designed for
low labeled-data regimes, evaluated across settings with 5 to 50 labeled
samples per class. Our approach integrates three specialized neural networks --
a generator for class-conditioned image translation, a discriminator for
authenticity assessment and classification, and a dedicated classifier --
within a three-phase training framework. The method alternates between
supervised training on limited labeled data and unsupervised learning that
leverages abundant unlabeled images through image-to-image translation rather
than generation from noise. We employ ensemble-based pseudo-labeling that
combines confidence-weighted predictions from the discriminator and classifier
with temporal consistency through exponential moving averaging, enabling
reliable label estimation for unlabeled data. Comprehensive evaluation across
eleven MedMNIST datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves statistically
significant improvements over six state-of-the-art GAN-based semi-supervised
methods, with particularly strong performance in the extreme 5-shot setting
where the scarcity of labeled data is most challenging. The framework maintains
its superiority across all evaluated settings (5, 10, 20, and 50 shots per
class). Our approach offers a practical solution for medical imaging
applications where annotation costs are prohibitive, enabling robust
classification performance even with minimal labeled data. Code is available at

the integration of self and cross-attention mechanisms in the generator
architecture, dynamic loss weighting, and cosine annealing learning rate
scheduling. These enhancements lead to significant improvements in identity
preservation, attribute consistency, and overall visual quality.
  Our experimental results, spanning 400,000 training iterations, demonstrate
progressive improvements in generator and discriminator performance. The
enhanced model achieves better identity similarity, lower FID scores, and
visibly superior qualitative results compared to the baseline. Ablation studies
confirm the importance of each architectural and training improvement. We
conclude by identifying key future directions, such as integrating StyleGAN3,
improving lip synchronization, incorporating 3D facial modeling, and
introducing temporal consistency for video-based applications.

Abstract: Large-scale natural image-text datasets, especially those automatically
collected from the web, often suffer from loose semantic alignment due to weak
supervision, while medical datasets tend to have high cross-modal correlation
but low content diversity. These properties pose a common challenge for
contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP): they hinder the model's ability
to learn robust and generalizable representations. In this work, we propose
CLIPin, a unified non-contrastive plug-in that can be seamlessly integrated
into CLIP-style architectures to improve multimodal semantic alignment,
providing stronger supervision and enhancing alignment robustness. Furthermore,
two shared pre-projectors are designed for image and text modalities
respectively to facilitate the integration of contrastive and non-contrastive
learning in a parameter-compromise manner. Extensive experiments on diverse
downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of CLIPin as a
plug-and-play component compatible with various contrastive frameworks. Code is

Abstract: Recent approaches for 3D relighting have shown promise in integrating 2D
image relighting generative priors to alter the appearance of a 3D
representation while preserving the underlying structure. Nevertheless,
generative priors used for 2D relighting that directly relight from an input
image do not take advantage of intrinsic properties of the subject that can be
inferred or cannot consider multi-view data at scale, leading to subpar
relighting. In this paper, we propose Lightswitch, a novel finetuned
material-relighting diffusion framework that efficiently relights an arbitrary
number of input images to a target lighting condition while incorporating cues
from inferred intrinsic properties. By using multi-view and material
information cues together with a scalable denoising scheme, our method
consistently and efficiently relights dense multi-view data of objects with
diverse material compositions. We show that our 2D relighting prediction
quality exceeds previous state-of-the-art relighting priors that directly
relight from images. We further demonstrate that LightSwitch matches or
outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion inverse rendering methods in relighting
synthetic and real objects in as little as 2 minutes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized content creation across
digital platforms, offering unprecedented capabilities in natural language
generation and understanding. These models enable beneficial applications such
as content generation, question and answering (Q&A), programming, and code
reasoning. Meanwhile, they also pose serious risks by inadvertently or
intentionally producing toxic, offensive, or biased content. This dual role of
LLMs, both as powerful tools for solving real-world problems and as potential
sources of harmful language, presents a pressing sociotechnical challenge. In
this survey, we systematically review recent studies spanning unintentional
toxicity, adversarial jailbreaking attacks, and content moderation techniques.
We propose a unified taxonomy of LLM-related harms and defenses, analyze
emerging multimodal and LLM-assisted jailbreak strategies, and assess
mitigation efforts, including reinforcement learning with human feedback

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to produce hallucinations - factually
incorrect or fabricated information - which poses significant challenges for
many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, such as dialogue systems.
As a result, detecting hallucinations has become a critical area of research.
Current approaches to hallucination detection in dialogue systems primarily
focus on verifying the factual consistency of generated responses. However,
these responses often contain a mix of accurate, inaccurate or unverifiable
facts, making one factual label overly simplistic and coarse-grained. In this
paper, we introduce a benchmark, FineDialFact, for fine-grained dialogue fact
verification, which involves verifying atomic facts extracted from dialogue
responses. To support this, we construct a dataset based on publicly available
dialogue datasets and evaluate it using various baseline methods. Experimental
results demonstrate that methods incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning
can enhance performance in dialogue fact verification. Despite this, the best
F1-score achieved on the HybriDialogue, an open-domain dialogue dataset, is
only 0.75, indicating that the benchmark remains a challenging task for future
research. Our dataset and code will be public on GitHub.

TL;DR: 研究发现，短暂记忆有助于语言学习，但会损害对人类阅读时间的预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨短暂记忆对语言学习的潜在益处，尤其是在Transformer模型中。

Method: 在Transformer语言模型上进行实验，比较有无短暂记忆对语言学习和阅读时间预测的影响。

Result: 短暂记忆提升了语言学习效果，但降低了阅读时间预测的准确性。

Conclusion: 短暂记忆对神经网络语言学习有益，但对行为预测无益。

Abstract: Human memory is fleeting. As words are processed, the exact wordforms that
make up incoming sentences are rapidly lost. Cognitive scientists have long
believed that this limitation of memory may, paradoxically, help in learning
language - an idea supported by classic connectionist modelling work. The rise
of Transformers appears to challenge this idea, as these models can learn
language effectively, despite lacking memory limitations or other architectural
recency biases. Here, we investigate the hypothesized benefit of fleeting
memory for language learning in tightly controlled experiments on transformer
language models. Training transformers with and without fleeting memory on a
developmentally realistic training set, we find that fleeting memory
consistently improves language learning (as quantified by both overall language
modelling performance and targeted syntactic evaluation) but, unexpectedly,
impairs surprisal-based prediction of human reading times. Interestingly,
follow up analyses revealed that this discrepancy - better language modeling,
yet worse reading time prediction - could not be accounted for by prior
explanations of why better language models sometimes fit human reading time
worse. Together, these results support a benefit of memory limitations on
neural network language learning - but not on predicting behavior.

TL;DR: 研究发现，直接基于抑郁评估语言响应的“镜像模型”存在“标准污染”，导致效应量虚高，泛化性降低；而非镜像模型虽效应量较小，但更具泛化性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨镜像模型和非镜像模型在抑郁评估中的表现差异，揭示标准污染对模型性能的影响。

Method: 使用GPT-4、GPT-4o和LLaMA3-70B模型，分别基于结构化诊断访谈和生活史访谈数据预测抑郁评分，比较两种模型的效应量和泛化性。

Result: 镜像模型效应量虚高（R²=0.80），非镜像模型效应量较小但更稳定（R²=0.27）；两者与自报抑郁症状的相关性相同（r≈0.54）。

Conclusion: 非镜像模型更具泛化性和实用性，未来抑郁评估应结合非镜像模型以提升语义特征的解释性和实用性。

Abstract: A growing number of studies show near-perfect LLM language-based prediction
of depression assessment scores (up to R2 of .70). However, many develop these
models directly from language responses to depression assessments. These
"Mirror models" suffer from "criterion contamination", which arises when a
predicted score depends in part on the predictors themselves. This causes
artificial effect size inflation which reduces model generalizability. The
present study compares the performance of Mirror models versus "Non-Mirror
models", which are developed from language that does not mirror the assessment
they are developed to predict. N = 110 research participants completed two
different interviews: structured diagnostic and life history interviews. GPT-4,
GPT-4o and LLaMA3-70B were then prompted to predict structured diagnostic
interview depression scores from the two transcripts separately. Mirror models
(using structured diagnostic data) showed very large effect sizes (e.g., R2 =
.80). As expected, NonMirror models (using life history data) demonstrated
smaller effect sizes, but were relatively large (e.g., R2 = .27). When Mirror
and Non-Mirror model-predicted structured interview depression scores were
correlated with self-reported depression symptoms, Mirror and NonMirror
performed the same (e.g., r = ~.54), indicating that Mirror models contain bias
perhaps due to criterion contamination. Topic modeling identified clusters
across Mirror and Non-Mirror models, as well as between true-positive and
false-positive predictions. In this head-to-head comparison study, Mirror
language AI models of depression showed artificially inflated effect sizes and
less generalizability. As language AI models for depression continue to evolve,
incorporating Non-Mirror models may identify interpretable, and generalizable
semantic features that have unique utility in real-world psychological
assessment.

Method: 重新解释属性值重构游戏，施加小词汇量约束模拟双重分节，提出类似自然语言屈折形态的新设置，开发新指标并探索与形态学相关的变体。

Result: 实验发现模拟音系约束促进连接性形态，涌现语言倾向于融合语法属性，与自然语言趋势一致。

Conclusion: 研究为涌现通信与自然语言形态学的比较提供了新视角，揭示了模拟约束对语言结构的影响。

Abstract: Emergent communication (EmCom) with deep neural network-based agents promises
to yield insights into the nature of human language, but remains focused
primarily on a few subfield-specific goals and metrics that prioritize
communication schemes which represent attributes with unique characters
one-to-one and compose them syntactically. We thus reinterpret a common EmCom
setting, the attribute-value reconstruction game, by imposing a
small-vocabulary constraint to simulate double articulation, and formulating a
novel setting analogous to naturalistic inflectional morphology (enabling
meaningful comparison to natural language communication schemes). We develop
new metrics and explore variations of this game motivated by real properties of
inflectional morphology: concatenativity and fusionality. Through our
experiments, we discover that simulated phonological constraints encourage
concatenative morphology, and emergent languages replicate the tendency of
natural languages to fuse grammatical attributes.

Abstract: Affective Computing has been established as a crucial field of inquiry to
advance the holistic development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems.
Foundation models -- especially Large Language Models (LLMs) -- have been
evaluated, trained, or instruction-tuned in several past works, to become
better predictors or generators of emotion. Most of these studies, however,
approach emotion-related tasks in a supervised manner, assessing or training
the capabilities of LLMs using discrete emotion labels associated with stimuli
(e.g., text, images, video, audio). Evaluation studies, in particular, have
often been limited to standard and superficial emotion-related tasks, such as
the recognition of evoked or expressed emotions. In this paper, we move beyond
surface-level emotion tasks to investigate how LLMs reason about emotions
through cognitive dimensions. Drawing from cognitive appraisal theory, we
examine whether LLMs produce coherent and plausible cognitive reasoning when
reasoning about emotionally charged stimuli. We introduce a large-scale
benchmark on Cognitive Reasoning for Emotions - CoRE - to evaluate internal
cognitive structures implicitly used by LLMs for emotional reasoning. Through a
plethora of evaluation experiments and analysis, we seek to answer: (a) Are
models more likely to implicitly rely on specific cognitive appraisal
dimensions?, (b) What cognitive dimensions are important for characterizing
specific emotions?, and, (c) Can the internal representations of different
emotion categories in LLMs be interpreted through cognitive appraisal
dimensions? Our results and analyses reveal diverse reasoning patterns across
different LLMs. Our benchmark and code will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 现有检索增强生成（RAG）方法难以单独评估检索的真实贡献，尤其是LLM作为阅读器时对提示的敏感性。

Method: 提出SPS度量方法，通过比较生成标记形成的区域与读者子空间主方向来评估语义对齐；基于SPS开发动态控制器框架xCompress。

Result: 在五个QA基准和四个开源LLM上的实验显示，SPS提升了任务性能并提供了检索与生成交互的理论视角。

Conclusion: SPS为检索增强生成提供了轻量级评估工具，xCompress框架进一步优化了检索摘要的动态处理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown improved generation performance
through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) following the retriever-reader
paradigm, which supplements model inputs with externally retrieved knowledge.
However, prior work often evaluates RAG holistically, assessing the retriever
and reader jointly, making it difficult to isolate the true contribution of
retrieval, particularly given the prompt sensitivity of LLMs used as readers.
We introduce Spectrum Projection Score (SPS), a lightweight, supervision-free
metric that allows the reader to gauge the semantic alignment of a retrieved
summary with its hidden representation by comparing the area formed by
generated tokens from the summary, and the principal directions of subspace in
the reader and to measure the relevance. Building on SPS we present xCompress,
an inference time controller framework that dynamically samples, ranks, and
compresses retrieval summary candidates. Extensive experiments on five QA
benchmarks with four open source LLMs show that SPS not only enhances
performance across a range of tasks but also provides a principled perspective
on the interaction between retrieval and generation.

Motivation: 亲社会性检测是一个新兴且重要的任务，但缺乏明确的定义和标注数据，需要新的方法来解决。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：1) 基于少量人工标注数据选择最佳LLM标注策略；2) 通过人类-AI协作迭代优化任务定义；3) 训练两阶段推理系统，结合轻量级分类器和GPT-4o处理模糊实例。

Result: 系统减少了70%的推理成本，同时保持高精度（约0.90）。

Conclusion: 通过人类-AI协作、任务定义优化和部署感知设计，实现了对新型负责任AI任务的可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting prosociality in text--communication intended to affirm, support, or
improve others' behavior--is a novel and increasingly important challenge for
trust and safety systems. Unlike toxic content detection, prosociality lacks
well-established definitions and labeled data, requiring new approaches to both
annotation and deployment. We present a practical, three-stage pipeline that
enables scalable, high-precision prosocial content classification while
minimizing human labeling effort and inference costs. First, we identify the
best LLM-based labeling strategy using a small seed set of human-labeled
examples. We then introduce a human-AI refinement loop, where annotators review
high-disagreement cases between GPT-4 and humans to iteratively clarify and
expand the task definition-a critical step for emerging annotation tasks like
prosociality. This process results in improved label quality and definition
alignment. Finally, we synthesize 10k high-quality labels using GPT-4 and train
a two-stage inference system: a lightweight classifier handles high-confidence
predictions, while only $\sim$35\% of ambiguous instances are escalated to
GPT-4o. This architecture reduces inference costs by $\sim$70% while achieving
high precision ($\sim$0.90). Our pipeline demonstrates how targeted human-AI
interaction, careful task formulation, and deployment-aware architecture design
can unlock scalable solutions for novel responsible AI tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注通过源和目标主题的分布对齐提取主题共享特征，但忽略了主题特定特征，限制了评估关键特质（如主题一致性）的能力。

Method: ATOP通过优化可学习的主题感知提示（包含共享和特定组件）从预训练语言模型中提取相关知识，并结合对抗训练和邻居分类器生成目标主题作文的伪标签。

Result: 在ASAP++数据集上的实验表明，ATOP在整体和多特质作文评分上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ATOP通过结合主题共享和特定特征，有效提升了跨主题AES的性能。

Abstract: Cross-topic automated essay scoring (AES) aims to develop a transferable
model capable of effectively evaluating essays on a target topic. A significant
challenge in this domain arises from the inherent discrepancies between topics.
While existing methods predominantly focus on extracting topic-shared features
through distribution alignment of source and target topics, they often neglect
topic-specific features, limiting their ability to assess critical traits such
as topic adherence. To address this limitation, we propose an Adversarial
TOpic-aware Prompt-tuning (ATOP), a novel method that jointly learns
topic-shared and topic-specific features to improve cross-topic AES. ATOP
achieves this by optimizing a learnable topic-aware prompt--comprising both
shared and specific components--to elicit relevant knowledge from pre-trained
language models (PLMs). To enhance the robustness of topic-shared prompt
learning and mitigate feature scale sensitivity introduced by topic alignment,
we incorporate adversarial training within a unified regression and
classification framework. In addition, we employ a neighbor-based classifier to
model the local structure of essay representations and generate pseudo-labels
for target-topic essays. These pseudo-labels are then used to guide the
supervised learning of topic-specific prompts tailored to the target topic.
Extensive experiments on the publicly available ASAP++ dataset demonstrate that
ATOP significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both
holistic and multi-trait essay scoring. The implementation of our method is
publicly available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ATOP-A271.

Motivation: 解决Transformer模型自注意力机制二次计算成本高的问题，并挑战稀疏性必然降低模型准确性的普遍假设。

Method: 在SST-2情感分析任务中，对DistilBERT模型的注意力机制引入结构化、后验稀疏性进行微调。

Result: 80%稀疏性的模型验证准确率达到91.59%，比密集基线提高了0.97%。

Conclusion: 注意力稀疏性不仅是计算效率工具，还能提升Transformer模型的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: The quadratic computational cost of the self-attention mechanism is a primary
challenge in scaling Transformer models. While attention sparsity is widely
studied as a technique to improve computational efficiency, it is almost
universally assumed to come at the cost of model accuracy. In this paper, we
report a surprising counter-example to this common wisdom. By introducing
structured, post-hoc sparsity to the attention mechanism of a DistilBERT model
during fine-tuning on the SST-2 sentiment analysis task, we find that model
accuracy improves significantly. Our model with 80\% attention sparsity
achieves a validation accuracy of 91.59\%, a 0.97\% absolute improvement over
the dense baseline. We hypothesize that this phenomenon is due to sparsity
acting as a powerful implicit regularizer, preventing the model from
overfitting by forcing it to make predictions with a more constrained and
robust set of features. Our work recasts attention sparsity not just as a tool
for computational efficiency, but as a potential method for improving the
generalization and performance of Transformer models.

Motivation: 现有自奖励语言模型在同步改进选择和拒绝响应时，逐渐缩小了对比样本的表征差异，削弱了偏好学习的有效性。

Method: 提出双阶段框架：(1) 锚定拒绝（固定初始模型的拒绝响应）；(2) 未来引导选择（动态筛选未来模型预测的选择样本）。

Result: 在多个模型家族和规模上实验表明，该方法显著优于基线，例如Llama3.1-8B在AlpacaEval 2.0上的胜率提升9.75。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了任务表现，还展现出优异的跨领域泛化能力，无需额外数据收集。

Abstract: Self-Rewarding Language Models propose an architecture in which the Large
Language Models(LLMs) both generates responses and evaluates its own outputs
via LLM-as-a-Judge prompting, dynamically improving its generative capabilities
through iterative Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). However, our analysis
reveals a critical limitation in existing Self-Rewarding paradigms: the
synchronized improvement of chosen and rejected responses progressively narrows
the representational difference between contrasting samples, undermining
effective preference learning. We propose \textbf{Temporal Self-Rewarding
Language Models} that strategically coordinate past, present, and future model
generations to sustain learning signals. Our dual-phase framework introduces:
(1) \textit{Anchored Rejection} - fixing rejected responses using the past
initial model's outputs and (2) \textit{Future-Guided Chosen} - dynamically
curating chosen samples using next-generation model predictions. Extensive
experiments across three model families (Llama, Qwen, Mistral) and different
model sizes (Llama3B/8B/70B) demonstrate significant improvements when trained
with our method compared to Self-Rewarding using same computation resources.
For example, Llama3.1-8B reaches a 29.44 win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0 with our
method, outperforming the Self-Rewarding baseline (19.69) by 9.75. Notably, our
method also demonstrates superior out-of-distribution generalization across
mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), knowledge-based QA (ARC, TruthfulQA), and code
generation (HumanEval) tasks, even though we do not specifically collect such
training data.

Motivation: 由于LLM的随机性，传统方法需要多次前向传播来探测其知识，计算成本高且耗时。

Method: 利用预训练的嵌入模型（如文本或图嵌入）作为代理，通过线性解码层预测LLM的知识输出。

Result: 在3个维基百科数据集、4种LLM和7种嵌入模型上的实验表明，嵌入模型预测LLM知识的准确率高达90%。

Conclusion: PEEK方法能高效识别LLM的知识缺口，并揭示其内部归纳偏差，为大规模分析提供了可能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire knowledge across diverse domains such as
science, history, and geography encountered during generative pre-training.
However, due to their stochasticity, it is difficult to predict what LLMs have
acquired. Prior work has developed different ways to probe this knowledge by
investigating the hidden representations, crafting specific task prompts,
curating representative samples, and estimating their uncertainty. However,
these methods require making forward passes through the underlying model to
probe the LLM's knowledge about a specific fact, making them computationally
expensive and time-consuming. To bridge this gap, we propose $\textbf{PEEK}$ or
$\textbf{P}$roxy $\textbf{E}$mbeddings to $\textbf{E}$stimate
$\textbf{K}$nowledge of LLMs, by leveraging the pre-trained embedding models
that effectively encode factual knowledge as text or graphs as proxies for
LLMs. First, we identify a training set of facts known by LLMs through various
probing strategies and then adapt embedding models to predict the LLM outputs
with a linear decoder layer. Comprehensive evaluation on $3$ Wikipedia-derived
datasets, $4$ LLMs, and $7$ embedding models shows that embeddings can predict
LLM knowledge on a held-out set with up to 90 % accuracy. Furthermore, we find
that sentence embedding models are more suitable than graph embeddings to
predict LLM knowledge, shedding light on the underlying representation of the
factual landscape. Thus, we believe that knowledge-adapted embeddings can be
used to identify knowledge gaps in LLMs at scale and can provide deeper
insights into LLMs' internal inductive bias. The code and data are made
available at https://github.com/claws-lab/peek.

Result: 在StoryER、HANNA和OpenMEVA三个基准测试中达到SOTA性能，并显著提升生成故事的质量。

Conclusion: EvolvR框架通过自进化方法有效解决了故事评估中的挑战，验证了其优越性和实用性。

Abstract: Although the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges
(LLM-as-a-judge) has been validated, their performance remains limited in
open-ended tasks, particularly in story evaluation. Accurate story evaluation
is crucial not only for assisting human quality judgment but also for providing
key signals to guide story generation. However, existing methods face a
dilemma: prompt engineering for closed-source models suffers from poor
adaptability, while fine-tuning approaches for open-source models lack the
rigorous reasoning capabilities essential for story evaluation. To address
this, we propose the Self-Evolving Pairwise Reasoning (EvolvR) framework.
Grounded in pairwise comparison, the framework first self-synthesizes
score-aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data via a multi-persona strategy. To
ensure data quality, these raw CoTs undergo a self-filtering process, utilizing
multi-agents to guarantee their logical rigor and robustness. Finally, the
evaluator trained on the refined data is deployed as a reward model to guide
the story generation task. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on three evaluation benchmarks
including StoryER, HANNA and OpenMEVA. Furthermore, when served as a reward
model, it significantly enhances the quality of generated stories, thereby
fully validating the superiority of our self-evolving approach.

Conclusion: ConlangCrafter展示了LLM在辅助人工语言创造中的潜力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Constructed languages (conlangs) such as Esperanto and Quenya have played
diverse roles in art, philosophy, and international communication. Meanwhile,
large-scale foundation models have revolutionized creative generation in text,
images, and beyond. In this work, we leverage modern LLMs as computational
creativity aids for end-to-end conlang creation. We introduce ConlangCrafter, a
multi-hop pipeline that decomposes language design into modular stages --
phonology, morphology, syntax, lexicon generation, and translation. At each
stage, our method leverages LLMs' meta-linguistic reasoning capabilities,
injecting randomness to encourage diversity and leveraging self-refinement
feedback to encourage consistency in the emerging language description. We
evaluate ConlangCrafter on metrics measuring coherence and typological
diversity, demonstrating its ability to produce coherent and varied conlangs
without human linguistic expertise.

Result: 实验表明LogicRAG在性能和效率上均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: LogicRAG通过动态推理结构实现了高效且准确的检索增强生成，适用于多样化查询场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often suffer from hallucination, generating
factually incorrect statements when handling questions beyond their knowledge
and perception. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this by
retrieving query-relevant contexts from knowledge bases to support LLM
reasoning. Recent advances leverage pre-constructed graphs to capture the
relational connections among distributed documents, showing remarkable
performance in complex tasks. However, existing Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG)
methods rely on a costly process to transform the corpus into a graph,
introducing overwhelming token cost and update latency. Moreover, real-world
queries vary in type and complexity, requiring different logic structures for
accurate reasoning. The pre-built graph may not align with these required
structures, resulting in ineffective knowledge retrieval. To this end, we
propose a \textbf{\underline{Logic}}-aware
\textbf{\underline{R}}etrieval-\textbf{\underline{A}}ugmented
\textbf{\underline{G}}eneration framework (\textbf{LogicRAG}) that dynamically
extracts reasoning structures at inference time to guide adaptive retrieval
without any pre-built graph. LogicRAG begins by decomposing the input query
into a set of subproblems and constructing a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to
model the logical dependencies among them. To support coherent multi-step
reasoning, LogicRAG then linearizes the graph using topological sort, so that
subproblems can be addressed in a logically consistent order. Besides, LogicRAG
applies graph pruning to reduce redundant retrieval and uses context pruning to
filter irrelevant context, significantly reducing the overall token cost.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that LogicRAG achieves both superior
performance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 论文提出AURA框架，通过多层次的Process Reward Models（PRMs）解决LLMs在逻辑推理和安全风险中的问题，显著提升模型输出的安全性和逻辑完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在逻辑推理中可能因忽视隐含逻辑而引发安全风险，传统方法无法有效检测和干预。

Method: 引入AURA框架，结合自省式自我批判、细粒度PRM评估和自适应安全解码，动态引导模型推理。

Result: 实验证明AURA显著优于现有方法，提升模型输出的逻辑完整性和安全性。

Conclusion: AURA为AI的安全性和上下文感知设定了新标准，推动了更负责任的人工智能发展。

Abstract: Present day LLMs face the challenge of managing affordance-based safety
risks-situations where outputs inadvertently facilitate harmful actions due to
overlooked logical implications. Traditional safety solutions, such as scalar
outcome-based reward models, parameter tuning, or heuristic decoding
strategies, lack the granularity and proactive nature needed to reliably detect
and intervene during subtle yet crucial reasoning steps. Addressing this
fundamental gap, we introduce AURA, an innovative, multi-layered framework
centered around Process Reward Models (PRMs), providing comprehensive, step
level evaluations across logical coherence and safety-awareness. Our framework
seamlessly combines introspective self-critique, fine-grained PRM assessments,
and adaptive safety-aware decoding to dynamically and proactively guide models
toward safer reasoning trajectories. Empirical evidence clearly demonstrates
that this approach significantly surpasses existing methods, significantly
improving the logical integrity and affordance-sensitive safety of model
outputs. This research represents a pivotal step toward safer, more
responsible, and contextually aware AI, setting a new benchmark for
alignment-sensitive applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有白盒知识蒸馏方法忽视了训练数据质量和学生模型兼容性，导致效果受限。

Method: SRD利用学生模型的反思动态评估和选择训练数据，并通过课程调度策略逐步引入这些数据。

Result: 实验表明SRD能提升蒸馏模型性能，并减少高达39%的训练时间。

Conclusion: 数据质量和兼容性对知识蒸馏至关重要，SRD为高效压缩大语言模型提供了实用框架。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a fundamental technique for compressing large
language models (LLMs) into compact, efficient student models. However,
existing white-box KD methods mainly focus on balancing ground truth and
student-generated responses while overlooking two critical factors: training
data quality and student-model compatibility. To address these limitations, we
propose Selective Reflection Distillation (SRD), a novel data curation
framework that leverages reflections from student models to systematically
refine training data. SRD dynamically evaluates and selects prompt-response
pairs by comparing ground truth data with student model outputs, selectively
curating high-quality, student-compatible training instances through automated
ranking based on difficulty. Furthermore, after selecting the training data, a
curriculum scheduling strategy is employed to incrementally introduce these
curated subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals. As a
plug-and-play enhancement, SRD consistently improves distillation outcomes
across diverse white-box KD approaches and model architectures, as well as
decreases computational cost significantly during KD training. Experiments on a
range of language model benchmarks demonstrate SRD's consistent improvements in
distilled model performance, as well as a reduction in training runtime by up
to 39%, under diverse KD methods and model families. Notably, SRD operates as a
plug-and-play module, enhancing sample efficiency without modifying underlying
KD algorithms. Our findings highlight that data quality and compatibility are
pivotal to effective and efficient distillation of LLMs, and SRD provides a
principled framework to achieve both. This work advances the understanding of
data-centric factors in KD and offers practical insights for enhancing the
capability and efficiency of compressed LLMs.

Abstract: This paper addresses the issue of implicit stereotypes that may arise during
the generation process of large language models. It proposes an interpretable
bias detection method aimed at identifying hidden social biases in model
outputs, especially those semantic tendencies that are not easily captured
through explicit linguistic features. The method combines nested semantic
representation with a contextual contrast mechanism. It extracts latent bias
features from the vector space structure of model outputs. Using attention
weight perturbation, it analyzes the model's sensitivity to specific social
attribute terms, thereby revealing the semantic pathways through which bias is
formed. To validate the effectiveness of the method, this study uses the
StereoSet dataset, which covers multiple stereotype dimensions including
gender, profession, religion, and race. The evaluation focuses on several key
metrics, such as bias detection accuracy, semantic consistency, and contextual
sensitivity. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves strong
detection performance across various dimensions. It can accurately identify
bias differences between semantically similar texts while maintaining high
semantic alignment and output stability. The method also demonstrates high
interpretability in its structural design. It helps uncover the internal bias
association mechanisms within language models. This provides a more transparent
and reliable technical foundation for bias detection. The approach is suitable
for real-world applications where high trustworthiness of generated content is
required.

Method: 提出TADrop，基于参数张量的分布特性动态调整稀疏率，稀疏冗余张量，保留关键张量。

Result: 实验表明，TADrop显著提升多种任务和模型的性能，平均性能增益达2.0%。

Conclusion: TADrop通过自适应稀疏化有效减少参数干扰，为高性能模型合并提供了新基准。

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a compelling data-free paradigm for multi-task
learning, enabling the fusion of multiple fine-tuned models into a single,
powerful entity. A key technique in merging methods is sparsification, which
prunes redundant parameters from task vectors to mitigate interference.
However, prevailing approaches employ a ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy,
applying a uniform sparsity ratio that overlooks the inherent structural and
statistical heterogeneity of model parameters. This often leads to a suboptimal
trade-off, where critical parameters are inadvertently pruned while less useful
ones are retained. To address this limitation, we introduce \textbf{TADrop}
(\textbf{T}ensor-wise \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{Drop}), an adaptive
sparsification strategy that respects this heterogeneity. Instead of a global
ratio, TADrop assigns a tailored sparsity level to each parameter tensor based
on its distributional properties. The core intuition is that tensors with
denser, more redundant distributions can be pruned aggressively, while sparser,
more critical ones are preserved. As a simple and plug-and-play module, we
validate TADrop by integrating it with foundational, classic, and SOTA merging
methods. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks (vision, language, and
multimodal) and models (ViT, BEiT) demonstrate that TADrop consistently and
significantly boosts their performance. For instance, when enhancing a leading
merging method, it achieves an average performance gain of 2.0\% across 8
ViT-B/32 tasks. TADrop provides a more effective way to mitigate parameter
interference by tailoring sparsification to the model's structure, offering a
new baseline for high-performance model merging.

Motivation: 现有方法中检索增强生成（RAG）和强化学习（RLVR）能力孤立发展，限制了泛化性和应用范围。

Method: 提出UR2框架，包含难度感知课程训练和混合知识访问策略，动态协调检索与推理。

Result: 在多个任务中表现优于现有方法，接近GPT-4o-mini和GPT-4.1-mini的性能。

Conclusion: UR2为检索与推理的统一提供了通用框架，显著提升了模型的多任务适应性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities through two
complementary paradigms: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which enhances
knowledge grounding, and Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR),
which optimizes complex reasoning abilities. However, these two capabilities
are often developed in isolation, and existing efforts to unify them remain
narrow in scope-typically limited to open-domain QA with fixed retrieval
settings and task-specific assumptions. This lack of integration constrains
generalization and limits the applicability of RAG-RL methods to broader
domains. To bridge this gap, we propose UR2 (Unified RAG and Reasoning), a
general framework that unifies retrieval and reasoning through reinforcement
learning. UR2 introduces two key contributions: a difficulty-aware curriculum
training that selectively invokes retrieval only for challenging problems, and
a hybrid knowledge access strategy combining domain-specific offline corpora
with LLM-generated summaries. These components are designed to enable dynamic
coordination between retrieval and reasoning, improving adaptability across a
diverse range of tasks. Experiments across open-domain QA, MMLU-Pro, medical,
and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that UR2 (built on Qwen2.5-3/7B
and LLaMA-3.1-8B) significantly outperforms existing RAG and RL methods,
achieving comparable performance to GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4.1-mini on several
benchmarks. We have released all code, models, and data at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语用学理论基于人类假设，不适用于LLM等预测系统，需重新思考。

Method: 提出HMC框架，分析概率语用学（如RSA框架）的适用性，探讨替代主义问题。

Result: 发现语境挫折现象，强调用户需共同构建语用条件。

Conclusion: 语用学理论需扩展以涵盖生成式AI的沟通。

Abstract: The paper reconceptualizes pragmatics not as a subordinate, third dimension
of meaning, but as a dynamic interface through which language operates as a
socially embedded tool for action. With the emergence of large language models
(LLMs) in communicative contexts, this understanding needs to be further
refined and methodologically reconsidered. The first section challenges the
traditional semiotic trichotomy, arguing that connectionist LLM architectures
destabilize established hierarchies of meaning, and proposes the Human-Machine
Communication (HMC) framework as a more suitable alternative. The second
section examines the tension between human-centred pragmatic theories and the
machine-centred nature of LLMs. While traditional, Gricean-inspired pragmatics
continue to dominate, it relies on human-specific assumptions ill-suited to
predictive systems like LLMs. Probabilistic pragmatics, particularly the
Rational Speech Act framework, offers a more compatible teleology by focusing
on optimization rather than truth-evaluation. The third section addresses the
issue of substitutionalism in three forms - generalizing, linguistic, and
communicative - highlighting the anthropomorphic biases that distort LLM
evaluation and obscure the role of human communicative subjects. Finally, the
paper introduces the concept of context frustration to describe the paradox of
increased contextual input paired with a collapse in contextual understanding,
emphasizing how users are compelled to co-construct pragmatic conditions both
for the model and themselves. These arguments suggest that pragmatic theory may
need to be adjusted or expanded to better account for communication involving
generative AI.

Result: 多样化文本变体显著提升新知识学习效果；RAG方法可能导致性能下降；模型能生成有效的合成训练数据。

Conclusion: 多样化数据增强是高效知识注入的关键，同时需平衡新知识学习和现有能力保留。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often require vast amounts of text to
effectively acquire new knowledge. While continuing pre-training on large
corpora or employing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven
successful, updating an LLM with only a few thousand or million tokens remains
challenging. In this work, we investigate the task of injecting small,
unstructured information into LLMs and its relation to the catastrophic
forgetting phenomenon. We use a dataset of recent news -- ensuring no overlap
with the model's pre-training data -- to evaluate the knowledge acquisition by
probing the model with question-answer pairs related the learned information.
Starting from a continued pre-training baseline, we explored different
augmentation algorithms to generate synthetic data to improve the knowledge
acquisition capabilities. Our experiments show that simply continuing
pre-training on limited data yields modest improvements, whereas exposing the
model to diverse textual variations significantly improves the learning of new
facts -- particularly with methods that induce greater variability through
diverse prompting. Furthermore, we shed light on the forgetting phenomenon in
small-data regimes, illustrating the delicate balance between learning new
content and retaining existing capabilities. We also confirm the sensitivity of
RAG-based approaches for knowledge injection, which often lead to greater
degradation on control datasets compared to parametric methods. Finally, we
demonstrate that models can generate effective synthetic training data
themselves, suggesting a pathway toward self-improving model updates. All code
and generated data used in our experiments are publicly available, providing a

Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言理解方面表现出色，但医疗领域需要更精准的诊断和个性化治疗推荐。DKG-LLM框架旨在通过动态知识图谱解决这一问题。

Method: 结合动态知识图谱（DKG）与Grok 3大语言模型，使用自适应语义融合算法（ASFA）处理异构医疗数据，动态更新知识图谱。

Result: DKG-LLM在诊断准确率上达到84.19%，治疗推荐准确率为89.63%，语义覆盖率为93.48%。

Conclusion: DKG-LLM是一种可靠且具有变革性的工具，能够处理噪声数据和复杂多症状疾病，并通过医生反馈进行学习。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have grown exponentially since the release of
ChatGPT. These models have gained attention due to their robust performance on
various tasks, including language processing tasks. These models achieve
understanding and comprehension of tasks by training billions of parameters.
The development of these models is a transformative force in enhancing natural
language understanding and has taken a significant step towards artificial
general intelligence (AGI). In this study, we aim to present the DKG-LLM
framework. The DKG-LLM framework introduces a groundbreaking approach to
medical diagnosis and personalized treatment recommendations by integrating a
dynamic knowledge graph (DKG) with the Grok 3 large language model. Using the
Adaptive Semantic Fusion Algorithm (ASFA), heterogeneous medical data
(including clinical reports and PubMed articles) and patient records
dynamically generate a knowledge graph consisting of 15,964 nodes in 13
distinct types (e.g., diseases, symptoms, treatments, patient profiles) and
127,392 edges in 26 relationship types (e.g., causal, therapeutic,
association). ASFA utilizes advanced probabilistic models, Bayesian inference,
and graph optimization to extract semantic information, dynamically updating
the graph with approximately 150 new nodes and edges in each data category
while maintaining scalability with up to 987,654 edges. Real-world datasets,
including MIMIC-III and PubMed, were utilized to evaluate the proposed
architecture. The evaluation results show that DKG-LLM achieves a diagnostic
accuracy of 84.19%. The model also has a treatment recommendation accuracy of
89.63% and a semantic coverage of 93.48%. DKG-LLM is a reliable and
transformative tool that handles noisy data and complex multi-symptom diseases,
along with feedback-based learning from physician input.

Result: 在多个数据集上取得最优性能，F1分数显著提升。

Conclusion: SceneJailEval在越狱评估中表现出色，解决了现有方法的不足，具有强扩展性和适应性。

Abstract: Precise jailbreak evaluation is vital for LLM red teaming and jailbreak
research. Current approaches employ binary classification ( e.g., string
matching, toxic text classifiers, LLM-driven methods), yielding only "yes/no"
labels without quantifying harm intensity. Existing multi-dimensional
frameworks ( e.g., Security Violation, Relative Truthfulness, Informativeness)
apply uniform evaluation criteria across scenarios, resulting in
scenario-specific mismatches--for instance, "Relative Truthfulness" is
irrelevant to "hate speech"--which compromise evaluation precision. To tackle
these limitations, we introduce SceneJailEval, with key contributions: (1) A
groundbreaking scenario-adaptive multi-dimensional framework for jailbreak
evaluation, overcoming the critical "one-size-fits-all" constraint of existing
multi-dimensional methods, and featuring strong extensibility to flexibly adapt
to customized or emerging scenarios. (2) A comprehensive 14-scenario dataset
with diverse jailbreak variants and regional cases, filling the long-standing
gap in high-quality, holistic benchmarks for scenario-adaptive evaluation. (3)
SceneJailEval achieves state-of-the-art results, with an F1 score of 0.917 on
our full-scenario dataset (+6% over prior SOTA) and 0.995 on JBB (+3% over
prior SOTA), surpassing accuracy limits of existing evaluation methods in
heterogeneous scenarios and confirming its advantage.

Method: 提出四层EI分类法，设计EICAP-Bench基准测试，评估并微调多个LLM。

Result: Qwen2.5-Instruct表现最佳，但微调仅显著提升Appraisal层能力。

Conclusion: 现有预训练和指令调优方法对深层情感推理能力提升有限，需针对性改进。

Abstract: Emotional Intelligence (EI) is a critical yet underexplored dimension in the
development of human-aligned LLMs. To address this gap, we introduce a unified,
psychologically grounded four-layer taxonomy of EI tailored for large language
models (LLMs), encompassing emotional tracking, cause inference, appraisal, and
emotionally appropriate response generation. Building on this framework, we
present EICAP-Bench, a novel MCQ style multi-turn benchmark designed to
evaluate EI capabilities in open-source LLMs across diverse linguistic and
cultural contexts. We evaluate six LLMs: LLaMA3 (8B), LLaMA3-Instruct, Gemma
(9B), Gemma-Instruct, Qwen2.5 (7B), and Qwen2.5-Instruct on EmoCap-Bench,
identifying Qwen2.5-Instruct as the strongest baseline. To assess the potential
for enhancing EI capabilities, we fine-tune both Qwen2.5-Base and
Qwen2.5-Instruct using LoRA adapters on UltraChat (UC), a large-scale,
instruction-tuned dialogue dataset, in both English and Arabic. Our statistical
analysis reveals that among the five EI layers, only the Appraisal layer shows
significant improvement through UC-based fine-tuning. These findings highlight
the limitations of existing pretraining and instruction-tuning paradigms in
equipping LLMs with deeper emotional reasoning and underscore the need for
targeted data and modeling strategies for comprehensive EI alignment.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于检索增强生成（RAG）的内容分类方法，通过动态检索上下文知识实现灵活、透明的分类，适用于内容审核等任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分类系统难以快速适应政策变化，需频繁重新训练。本文旨在通过RAG方法实现无需重新训练的动态分类。

Method: 提出Contextual Policy Engine（CPE），利用RAG将分类任务转化为基于检索知识的推理，支持动态政策更新。

Result: 实验表明CPE在分类准确性、解释性和动态更新方面表现优异，无需重新训练即可调整政策。

Conclusion: RAG方法使分类更灵活、透明，适用于内容审核及其他分类问题。

Abstract: Robust content moderation requires classification systems that can quickly
adapt to evolving policies without costly retraining. We present classification
using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which shifts traditional
classification tasks from determining the correct category in accordance with
pre-trained parameters to evaluating content in relation to contextual
knowledge retrieved at inference. In hate speech detection, this transforms the
task from "is this hate speech?" to "does this violate the hate speech policy?"
  Our Contextual Policy Engine (CPE) - an agentic RAG system - demonstrates
this approach and offers three key advantages: (1) robust classification
accuracy comparable to leading commercial systems, (2) inherent explainability
via retrieved policy segments, and (3) dynamic policy updates without model
retraining. Through three experiments, we demonstrate strong baseline
performance and show that the system can apply fine-grained policy control by
correctly adjusting protection for specific identity groups without requiring
retraining or compromising overall performance. These findings establish that
RAG can transform classification into a more flexible, transparent, and
adaptable process for content moderation and wider classification problems.

Result: 当前模型在计算和语义因果推理上表现较差，与人类能力差距显著。

Conclusion: InfoCausalQA揭示了多模态AI系统在因果推理能力上的不足，需进一步研究提升。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in perception and reasoning. However, the ability to perform
causal inference -- a core aspect of human cognition -- remains underexplored,
particularly in multimodal settings. In this study, we introduce InfoCausalQA,
a novel benchmark designed to evaluate causal reasoning grounded in
infographics that combine structured visual data with textual context. The
benchmark comprises two tasks: Task 1 focuses on quantitative causal reasoning
based on inferred numerical trends, while Task 2 targets semantic causal
reasoning involving five types of causal relations: cause, effect,
intervention, counterfactual, and temporal. We manually collected 494
infographic-text pairs from four public sources and used GPT-4o to generate
1,482 high-quality multiple-choice QA pairs. These questions were then
carefully revised by humans to ensure they cannot be answered based on
surface-level cues alone but instead require genuine visual grounding. Our
experimental results reveal that current VLMs exhibit limited capability in
computational reasoning and even more pronounced limitations in semantic causal
reasoning. Their significantly lower performance compared to humans indicates a
substantial gap in leveraging infographic-based information for causal
inference. Through InfoCausalQA, we highlight the need for advancing the causal
reasoning abilities of multimodal AI systems.

Result: 合成数据显著提升分类性能，小规模领域专用LLM（LeoLM）优于大规模通用LLM（ChatGPT）。

Conclusion: 生成式AI可有效填补低资源领域的数据缺口，方法透明且可复现。

Abstract: Intent recognition (IR) for speech commands is essential for artificial
intelligence (AI) assistant systems; however, most existing approaches are
limited to short commands and are predominantly developed for English. This
paper addresses these limitations by focusing on IR from speech by elderly
German speakers. We propose a novel approach that combines an adapted Whisper
ASR model, fine-tuned on elderly German speech (SVC-de), with Transformer-based
language models trained on synthetic text datasets generated by three
well-known large language models (LLMs): LeoLM, Llama3, and ChatGPT. To
evaluate the robustness of our approach, we generate synthetic speech with a
text-to-speech model and conduct extensive cross-dataset testing. Our results
show that synthetic LLM-generated data significantly boosts classification
performance and robustness to different speaking styles and unseen vocabulary.
Notably, we find that LeoLM, a smaller, domain-specific 13B LLM, surpasses the
much larger ChatGPT (175B) in dataset quality for German intent recognition.
Our approach demonstrates that generative AI can effectively bridge data gaps
in low-resource domains. We provide detailed documentation of our data
generation and training process to ensure transparency and reproducibility.

*Ruichong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MDIR的新方法，用于检测大型语言模型（LLM）中的抄袭行为，解决了现有方法在权重对应重建、统计显著性计算和误报方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，大型语言模型（LLM）中的知识产权（IP）问题日益突出，现有抄袭检测方法存在权重对应重建不准确、缺乏统计显著性计算能力及误报等问题。

Method: MDIR利用矩阵分析和大偏差理论，专注于权重相似性，无需完整模型推理，能够准确重建权重关系并提供严格的p值估计。

Result: 实验表明，MDIR即使在随机排列和持续预训练等复杂变换后，仍能可靠检测抄袭，且所有检测可在单台PC上一小时内完成。

Conclusion: MDIR是一种高效、准确的LLM抄袭检测方法，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: In recent years, concerns about intellectual property (IP) in large language
models (LLMs) have grown significantly. Plagiarizing other LLMs (through direct
weight copying, upcycling, pruning, or continual pretraining) and claiming
authorship without properly attributing to the original license, is a serious
misconduct that can lead to significant financial and reputational harm to the
original developers. However, existing methods for detecting LLM plagiarism
fall short in key areas. They fail to accurately reconstruct weight
correspondences, lack the ability to compute statistical significance measures
such as $p$-values, and may mistakenly flag models trained on similar data as
being related. To address these limitations, we propose Matrix-Driven Instant
Review (MDIR), a novel method that leverages matrix analysis and Large
Deviation Theory. MDIR achieves accurate reconstruction of weight
relationships, provides rigorous $p$-value estimation, and focuses exclusively
on weight similarity without requiring full model inference. Experimental
results demonstrate that MDIR reliably detects plagiarism even after extensive
transformations, such as random permutations and continual pretraining with
trillions of tokens. Moreover, all detections can be performed on a single PC
within an hour, making MDIR both efficient and accessible.

TL;DR: 论文提出DynamicTRF框架，通过动态选择适合的图表示形式（TRF）来提升大型多模态模型（LMMs）在零样本图问答任务中的准确性和简洁性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅使用单一图表示形式（TRF），无法适应不同模型或任务的需求，导致回答不准确或冗长。

Method: 设计了一组针对零样本图问答的TRF（$F_{ZS}$），并提出新指标GRE衡量性能与简洁性。开发DynamicTRF框架，包括TRF偏好数据集（TRFP）和TRF路由器。

Result: 在7个领域内算法图问答任务和2个领域外下游任务中，DynamicTRF显著提升了LMMs的零样本图问答准确性。

Conclusion: DynamicTRF通过动态选择TRF，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了图问答任务的性能。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown generalized zero-shot capabilities
in diverse domain question-answering (QA) tasks, including graph QA that
involves complex graph topologies. However, most current approaches use only a
single type of graph representation, namely Topology Representation Form (TRF),
such as prompt-unified text descriptions or style-fixed visual styles. Those
"one-size-fits-all" approaches fail to consider the specific preferences of
different models or tasks, often leading to incorrect or overly long responses.
To address this, we first analyze the characteristics and weaknesses of
existing TRFs, and then design a set of TRFs, denoted by $F_{ZS}$, tailored to
zero-shot graph QA. We then introduce a new metric, Graph Response Efficiency
(GRE), which measures the balance between the performance and the brevity in
graph QA. Built on these, we develop the DynamicTRF framework, which aims to
improve both the accuracy and conciseness of graph QA. To be specific,
DynamicTRF first creates a TRF Preference (TRFP) dataset that ranks TRFs based
on their GRE scores, to probe the question-specific TRF preferences. Then it
trains a TRF router on the TRFP dataset, to adaptively assign the best TRF from
$F_{ZS}$ for each question during the inference. Extensive experiments across 7
in-domain algorithmic graph QA tasks and 2 out-of-domain downstream tasks show
that DynamicTRF significantly enhances the zero-shot graph QA of LMMs in terms
of accuracy

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络欺凌检测因表达隐晦多样而具有挑战性，研究旨在探索辅助任务（如攻击性检测）是否能提升检测效果。

Method: 使用指令调优的大语言模型，在五个攻击性数据集和一个网络欺凌数据集上评估零样本、少样本、独立LoRA微调和多任务学习策略，并提出基于增强提示的管道方法。

Result: 增强提示管道方法在性能上优于标准LoRA微调，表明攻击性信息能显著提升网络欺凌检测。

Conclusion: 辅助任务（如攻击性检测）可提升大语言模型在安全关键应用中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Detecting cyberbullying on social media remains a critical challenge due to
its subtle and varied expressions. This study investigates whether integrating
aggression detection as an auxiliary task within a unified training framework
can enhance the generalisation and performance of large language models (LLMs)
in cyberbullying detection. Experiments are conducted on five aggression
datasets and one cyberbullying dataset using instruction-tuned LLMs. We
evaluated multiple strategies: zero-shot, few-shot, independent LoRA
fine-tuning, and multi-task learning (MTL). Given the inconsistent results of
MTL, we propose an enriched prompt pipeline approach in which aggression
predictions are embedded into cyberbullying detection prompts to provide
contextual augmentation. Preliminary results show that the enriched prompt
pipeline consistently outperforms standard LoRA fine-tuning, indicating that
aggression-informed context significantly boosts cyberbullying detection. This
study highlights the potential of auxiliary tasks, such as aggression
detection, to improve the generalisation of LLMs for safety-critical
applications on social networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将LLMs的角色扮演和情感支持能力分开研究，缺乏结合两者的探索。论文旨在填补这一空白，通过动漫角色案例验证LLMs在情感支持角色扮演中的潜力。

Method: 选择20个热门动漫角色，设计60个情感场景问题，招募40名中国动漫爱好者，收集10个LLMs和人类的两轮对话数据，并设计包含9个细粒度指标的评价系统。

Result: 实验显示，表现最佳的LLMs在角色扮演和情感支持上超越人类，但人类在回答多样性上仍占优。

Conclusion: ChatAnime数据集为未来优化LLMs在情感支持角色扮演中的研究提供了资源和见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
role-playing conversations and providing emotional support as separate research
directions. However, there remains a significant research gap in combining
these capabilities to enable emotionally supportive interactions with virtual
characters. To address this research gap, we focus on anime characters as a
case study because of their well-defined personalities and large fan bases.
This choice enables us to effectively evaluate how well LLMs can provide
emotional support while maintaining specific character traits. We introduce
ChatAnime, the first Emotionally Supportive Role-Playing (ESRP) dataset. We
first thoughtfully select 20 top-tier characters from popular anime communities
and design 60 emotion-centric real-world scenario questions. Then, we execute a
nationwide selection process to identify 40 Chinese anime enthusiasts with
profound knowledge of specific characters and extensive experience in
role-playing. Next, we systematically collect two rounds of dialogue data from
10 LLMs and these 40 Chinese anime enthusiasts. To evaluate the ESRP
performance of LLMs, we design a user experience-oriented evaluation system
featuring 9 fine-grained metrics across three dimensions: basic dialogue,
role-playing and emotional support, along with an overall metric for response
diversity. In total, the dataset comprises 2,400 human-written and 24,000
LLM-generated answers, supported by over 132,000 human annotations.
Experimental results show that top-performing LLMs surpass human fans in
role-playing and emotional support, while humans still lead in response
diversity. We hope this work can provide valuable resources and insights for
future research on optimizing LLMs in ESRP. Our datasets are available at
https://github.com/LanlanQiu/ChatAnime.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCP的动态数据聚合功能引入安全和隐私风险，现有防御方法效果不足。

Method: SecMCP利用潜在多面体空间建模LLM激活向量，检测对话动态异常。

Result: 在多个LLM和数据集上测试，AUROC得分超过0.915，系统实用性良好。

Conclusion: SecMCP有效解决了MCP的安全威胁，并提供了新的量化方法。

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating external tools, enabling dynamic aggregation of real-time data to
improve task execution. However, its non-isolated execution context introduces
critical security and privacy risks. In particular, adversarially crafted
content can induce tool poisoning or indirect prompt injection, leading to
conversation hijacking, misinformation propagation, or data exfiltration.
Existing defenses, such as rule-based filters or LLM-driven detection, remain
inadequate due to their reliance on static signatures, computational
inefficiency, and inability to quantify conversational hijacking. To address
these limitations, we propose SecMCP, a secure framework that detects and
quantifies conversation drift, deviations in latent space trajectories induced
by adversarial external knowledge. By modeling LLM activation vectors within a
latent polytope space, SecMCP identifies anomalous shifts in conversational
dynamics, enabling proactive detection of hijacking, misleading, and data
exfiltration. We evaluate SecMCP on three state-of-the-art LLMs (Llama3,
Vicuna, Mistral) across benchmark datasets (MS MARCO, HotpotQA, FinQA),
demonstrating robust detection with AUROC scores exceeding 0.915 while
maintaining system usability. Our contributions include a systematic
categorization of MCP security threats, a novel latent polytope-based
methodology for quantifying conversation drift, and empirical validation of
SecMCP's efficacy.

Motivation: 解决现有大型语言模型代理程序记忆脆弱、依赖手工设计或静态参数的问题。

Method: 提出Memp方法，通过动态构建、检索和更新程序记忆，结合细粒度指令和高级抽象。

Result: 在TravelPlanner和ALFWorld任务中，代理成功率与效率随记忆库优化而提升；迁移记忆至较弱模型也能显著提升性能。

Conclusion: Memp方法有效增强代理的程序记忆能力，支持终身学习与性能迁移。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based agents excel at diverse tasks, yet they
suffer from brittle procedural memory that is manually engineered or entangled
in static parameters. In this work, we investigate strategies to endow agents
with a learnable, updatable, and lifelong procedural memory. We propose Memp
that distills past agent trajectories into both fine-grained, step-by-step
instructions and higher-level, script-like abstractions, and explore the impact
of different strategies for Build, Retrieval, and Update of procedural memory.
Coupled with a dynamic regimen that continuously updates, corrects, and
deprecates its contents, this repository evolves in lockstep with new
experience. Empirical evaluation on TravelPlanner and ALFWorld shows that as
the memory repository is refined, agents achieve steadily higher success rates
and greater efficiency on analogous tasks. Moreover, procedural memory built
from a stronger model retains its value: migrating the procedural memory to a
weaker model yields substantial performance gains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming social-science research by
enabling scalable, precise analysis. Their adaptability raises the question of
whether knowledge acquired through fine-tuning in a few languages can transfer
to unseen languages that only appeared during pre-training. To examine this, we
fine-tune lightweight LLaMA 3.2-3B models on monolingual, bilingual, or
multilingual data sets to classify immigration-related tweets from X/Twitter
across 13 languages, a domain characterised by polarised, culturally specific
discourse. We evaluate whether minimal language-specific fine-tuning enables
cross-lingual topic detection and whether adding targeted languages corrects
pre-training biases. Results show that LLMs fine-tuned in one or two languages
can reliably classify immigration-related content in unseen languages. However,
identifying whether a tweet expresses a pro- or anti-immigration stance
benefits from multilingual fine-tuning. Pre-training bias favours dominant
languages, but even minimal exposure to under-represented languages during
fine-tuning (as little as $9.62\times10^{-11}$ of the original pre-training
token volume) yields significant gains. These findings challenge the assumption
that cross-lingual mastery requires extensive multilingual training: limited
language coverage suffices for topic-level generalisation, and structural
biases can be corrected with lightweight interventions. By releasing
4-bit-quantised, LoRA fine-tuned models, we provide an open-source,
reproducible alternative to proprietary LLMs that delivers 35 times faster
inference at just 0.00000989% of the dollar cost of the OpenAI GPT-4o model,
enabling scalable, inclusive research.

Result: AI使用近年显著增加，尤其在地方和大学新闻中；AI提升了词汇丰富度和可读性，但降低了正式性，导致写作风格趋同。

Conclusion: 生成式AI在新闻写作中的应用日益广泛，需关注其对新闻风格和诚信的影响。

Abstract: The rapid rise of Generative AI (GenAI), particularly LLMs, poses concerns
for journalistic integrity and authorship. This study examines AI-generated
content across over 40,000 news articles from major, local, and college news
media, in various media formats. Using three advanced AI-text detectors (e.g.,
Binoculars, Fast-Detect GPT, and GPTZero), we find substantial increase of
GenAI use in recent years, especially in local and college news. Sentence-level
analysis reveals LLMs are often used in the introduction of news, while
conclusions usually written manually. Linguistic analysis shows GenAI boosts
word richness and readability but lowers formality, leading to more uniform
writing styles, particularly in local media.

Result: 实验显示，SlimInfer在LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct上实现2.53倍TTFT加速和1.88倍端到端延迟降低。

Conclusion: SlimInfer高效加速LLM推理，不影响性能，代码将开源。

Abstract: Long-context inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily limited by
high computational demands. While several existing methods optimize attention
computation, they still process the full set of hidden states at each layer,
limiting overall efficiency. In this work, we propose SlimInfer, an innovative
framework that aims to accelerate inference by directly pruning less critical
prompt tokens during the forward pass. Our key insight is an information
diffusion phenomenon: As information from critical tokens propagates through
layers, it becomes distributed across the entire sequence. This diffusion
process suggests that LLMs can maintain their semantic integrity when excessive
tokens, even including these critical ones, are pruned in hidden states.
Motivated by this, SlimInfer introduces a dynamic fine-grained pruning
mechanism that accurately removes redundant tokens of hidden state at
intermediate layers. This layer-wise pruning naturally enables an asynchronous
KV cache manager that prefetches required token blocks without complex
predictors, reducing both memory usage and I/O costs. Extensive experiments
show that SlimInfer can achieve up to $\mathbf{2.53\times}$ time-to-first-token
(TTFT) speedup and $\mathbf{1.88\times}$ end-to-end latency reduction for
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct on a single RTX 4090, without sacrificing performance on
LongBench. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 触觉信号在多模态研究中较少被探索，而其在虚拟现实、无障碍和康复应用中具有潜力。

Method: 提出HapticLLaMA模型，结合频率和EnCodec两种触觉分词器，通过监督微调和强化学习优化模型。

Result: 模型在自动评估和人工评估中表现优异，METEOR得分59.98，BLEU-4得分32.06，61%的生成描述获高评分。

Conclusion: HapticLLaMA展示了大型语言模型处理感官数据的潜力，强化学习显著提升了模型与人类感知的对齐。

Abstract: Haptic captioning is the task of generating natural language descriptions
from haptic signals, such as vibrations, for use in virtual reality,
accessibility, and rehabilitation applications. While previous multimodal
research has focused primarily on vision and audio, haptic signals for the
sense of touch remain underexplored. To address this gap, we formalize the
haptic captioning task and propose HapticLLaMA, a multimodal sensory language
model that interprets vibration signals into descriptions in a given sensory,
emotional, or associative category. We investigate two types of haptic
tokenizers, a frequency-based tokenizer and an EnCodec-based tokenizer, that
convert haptic signals into sequences of discrete units, enabling their
integration with the LLaMA model. HapticLLaMA is trained in two stages: (1)
supervised fine-tuning using the LLaMA architecture with LoRA-based adaptation,
and (2) fine-tuning via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). We
assess HapticLLaMA's captioning performance using both automated n-gram metrics
and human evaluation. HapticLLaMA demonstrates strong capability in
interpreting haptic vibration signals, achieving a METEOR score of 59.98 and a
BLEU-4 score of 32.06 respectively. Additionally, over 61% of the generated
captions received human ratings above 3.5 on a 7-point scale, with RLHF
yielding a 10% improvement in the overall rating distribution, indicating
stronger alignment with human haptic perception. These findings highlight the
potential of large language models to process and adapt to sensory data.

process to develop this ability through targeted fine-tuning on heuristically
identified demonstrations of convention formation. We evaluate with two new
benchmarks focused on this capability. First, we design a focused,
cognitively-motivated interaction benchmark that consistently elicits strong
convention formation trends in humans. Second, we create a new
document-grounded reference completion task that reflects in-the-wild
convention formation behavior. Our studies show significantly improved
convention formation abilities in post-trained LLMs across the two evaluation
methods.

### [144] [Diagrams-to-Dynamics (D2D): Exploring Causal Loop Diagram Leverage Points under Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05659)
*Jeroen F. Uleman,Loes Crielaard,Leonie K. Elsenburg,Guido A. Veldhuis,Karien Stronks,Naja Hulvej Rod,Rick Quax,Vítor V. Vasconcelos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Diagrams-to-Dynamics (D2D)方法，将因果循环图(CLDs)转化为系统动力学模型(SDMs)，支持动态分析和干预策略探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLDs作为静态定性工具，无法支持动态分析且易导致错误推断，需改进方法。

Method: 通过用户简单标注变量类型，利用CLDs的结构信息（链接存在性和极性）生成SDMs，模拟干预和探索杠杆点。

Result: D2D能区分高低优先级杠杆点，与数据驱动模型一致性优于网络中心性分析，并提供不确定性估计。

Conclusion: D2D方法实用性强，开源工具支持广泛应用，未来验证将进一步提升其跨领域适用性。

Abstract: Causal loop diagrams (CLDs) are widely used in health and environmental
research to represent hypothesized causal structures underlying complex
problems. However, as qualitative and static representations, CLDs are limited
in their ability to support dynamic analysis and inform intervention
strategies. Additionally, quantitative CLD analysis methods like network
centrality analysis often lead to false inference. We propose
Diagrams-to-Dynamics (D2D), a method for converting CLDs into exploratory
system dynamics models (SDMs) in the absence of empirical data. With minimal
user input - following a protocol to label variables as stocks,
flows/auxiliaries, or constants - D2D leverages the structural information
already encoded in CLDs, namely, link existence and polarity, to simulate
hypothetical interventions and explore potential leverage points under
uncertainty. Results suggest that D2D helps distinguish between high- and
low-ranked leverage points. We compare D2D to a data-driven SDM constructed
from the same CLD and variable labeling. D2D showed greater consistency with
the data-driven model than network centrality analysis, while providing
uncertainty estimates and guidance for future data collection. The method is
implemented in an open-source Python package and a web-based application to
support further testing and lower the barrier to dynamic modeling for
researchers working with CLDs. We expect additional validation will further
establish the approach's utility across a broad range of cases and domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决物理方程表示中的语义模糊问题，并通过知识图揭示物理定律之间的潜在联系。

Method: 构建包含400个高级物理方程的知识图，使用变量重叠、物理重要性评分和文献计量数据定义权重，训练图注意力网络进行链接预测。

Result: 测试AUC达到0.9742，显著优于基线方法，模型成功识别了物理学的宏观结构、核心方程和跨领域关系。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅验证了已知物理关系，还提出了新的数学类比，为物理学的跨领域研究提供了工具和数据支持。

Abstract: This work introduces a novel framework for representing and analyzing
physical laws as a weighted knowledge graph. We constructed a database of 659
distinct physical equations, subjected to rigorous semantic cleaning to resolve
notational ambiguities, resulting in a corpus of 400 advanced physics
equations. We developed an enhanced graph representation where both physical
concepts and equations are nodes, connected by weighted inter-equation bridges.
These weights are objectively defined using normalized metrics for variable
overlap, physics-informed importance scores, and bibliometric data. A Graph
Attention Network (GAT) was trained for link prediction, achieving a test AUC
of 0.9742 +/- 0.0018 across five independent runs, significantly outperforming
both classical heuristics (best baseline AUC: 0.9487) and established GNN
architectures like GraphSAGE (AUC: 0.9504, p = 0.029). Statistical testing
confirmed significance of all comparisons (p < 0.05), with 2.7% improvement
over the best baseline. Our analysis reveals three key findings: (i) The model
autonomously rediscovers the known macroscopic structure of physics,
identifying strong conceptual axes between Electromagnetism and Statistical
Mechanics. (ii) It identifies central hub equations that serve as critical
bridges between multiple physical domains. (iii) The model generates stable,
computationally-derived hypotheses for cross-domain relationships, identifying
both known principles and suggesting novel mathematical analogies for further
theoretical investigation. The framework can generate hundreds of such
hypotheses, enabling the creation of specialized datasets for targeted analysis
of specific physics subfields. Code and data available at

TL;DR: SCAR是一种基于Edge AI的框架，通过ML压缩技术优化6G车载娱乐资源管理，提升调度公平性和吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G网络为车载娱乐服务带来新机遇，但传统RRM技术难以应对复杂的CQI数据。

Method: SCAR采用ML压缩技术（如聚类和RBF网络）减少CQI数据量，并训练6G强化学习策略。

Result: SCAR将可行调度时间提升14%，不公平调度时间减少15%，CQI聚类失真降低10%。

Conclusion: SCAR在动态车载网络中展现出可扩展性和公平性优势。

Abstract: The advent of 6G networks opens new possibilities for connected infotainment
services in vehicular environments. However, traditional Radio Resource
Management (RRM) techniques struggle with the increasing volume and complexity
of data such as Channel Quality Indicators (CQI) from autonomous vehicles. To
address this, we propose SCAR (State-Space Compression for AI-Driven Resource
Management), an Edge AI-assisted framework that optimizes scheduling and
fairness in vehicular infotainment. SCAR employs ML-based compression
techniques (e.g., clustering and RBF networks) to reduce CQI data size while
preserving essential features. These compressed states are used to train
6G-enabled Reinforcement Learning policies that maximize throughput while
meeting fairness objectives defined by the NGMN. Simulations show that SCAR
increases time in feasible scheduling regions by 14\% and reduces unfair
scheduling time by 15\% compared to RL baselines without CQI compression.
Furthermore, Simulated Annealing with Stochastic Tunneling (SAST)-based
clustering reduces CQI clustering distortion by 10\%, confirming its
efficiency. These results demonstrate SCAR's scalability and fairness benefits
for dynamic vehicular networks.

Motivation: 在非线性系统中设计有效的“nudging”项具有挑战性，因此需要一种数据驱动的方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 利用神经网络学习非线性状态空间模型中的“nudging”项，并基于Kazantzis--Kravaris--Luenberger观测器理论提供理论支持。

Result: 在Lorenz 96模型、Kuramoto--Sivashinsky方程和Kolmogorov流三个混沌行为基准问题上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 神经网络“nudging”方法为非线性系统中的数据同化提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Nudging is an empirical data assimilation technique that incorporates an
observation-driven control term into the model dynamics. The trajectory of the
nudged system approaches the true system trajectory over time, even when the
initial conditions differ. For linear state space models, such control terms
can be derived under mild assumptions. However, designing effective nudging
terms becomes significantly more challenging in the nonlinear setting. In this
work, we propose neural network nudging, a data-driven method for learning
nudging terms in nonlinear state space models. We establish a theoretical
existence result based on the Kazantzis--Kravaris--Luenberger observer theory.
The proposed approach is evaluated on three benchmark problems that exhibit
chaotic behavior: the Lorenz 96 model, the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation, and
the Kolmogorov flow.

Conclusion: SE-VAE通过设计而非统计正则化实现解耦，为科学和社会领域的白盒生成建模提供了原则性框架。

Abstract: Learning interpretable latent representations from tabular data remains a
challenge in deep generative modeling. We introduce SE-VAE (Structural
Equation-Variational Autoencoder), a novel architecture that embeds measurement
structure directly into the design of a variational autoencoder. Inspired by
structural equation modeling, SE-VAE aligns latent subspaces with known
indicator groupings and introduces a global nuisance latent to isolate
construct-specific confounding variation. This modular architecture enables
disentanglement through design rather than through statistical regularizers
alone. We evaluate SE-VAE on a suite of simulated tabular datasets and
benchmark its performance against a series of leading baselines using standard
disentanglement metrics. SE-VAE consistently outperforms alternatives in factor
recovery, interpretability, and robustness to nuisance variation. Ablation
results reveal that architectural structure, rather than regularization
strength, is the key driver of performance. SE-VAE offers a principled
framework for white-box generative modeling in scientific and social domains
where latent constructs are theory-driven and measurement validity is
essential.

Abstract: Accurate distribution grid topology is essential for reliable modern grid
operations. However, real-world utility data originates from multiple sources
with varying characteristics and levels of quality. In this work, developed in
collaboration with Oncor Electric Delivery, we propose a scalable framework
that reconstructs a trustworthy grid topology by systematically integrating
heterogeneous data. We observe that distribution topology is fundamentally
governed by two complementary dimensions: the spatial layout of physical
infrastructure (e.g., GIS and asset metadata) and the dynamic behavior of the
system in the signal domain (e.g., voltage time series). When jointly
leveraged, these dimensions support a complete and physically coherent
reconstruction of network connectivity. To address the challenge of uneven data
quality without compromising observability, we introduce a confidence-aware
inference mechanism that preserves structurally informative yet imperfect
inputs, while quantifying the reliability of each inferred connection for
operator interpretation. This soft handling of uncertainty is tightly coupled
with hard enforcement of physical feasibility: we embed operational
constraints, such as transformer capacity limits and radial topology
requirements, directly into the learning process. Together, these components
ensure that inference is both uncertainty-aware and structurally valid,
enabling rapid convergence to actionable, trustworthy topologies under
real-world deployment conditions. The proposed framework is validated using
data from over 8000 meters across 3 feeders in Oncor's service territory,
demonstrating over 95% accuracy in topology reconstruction and substantial
improvements in confidence calibration and computational efficiency relative to
baseline methods.

Abstract: Across scientific domains, a fundamental challenge is to characterize and
compute the mappings from underlying physical processes to observed signals and
measurements. While nonlinear neural networks have achieved considerable
success, they remain theoretically opaque, which hinders adoption in contexts
where interpretability is paramount. In contrast, linear neural networks serve
as a simple yet effective foundation for gaining insight into these complex
relationships. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical framework for
analyzing linear encoder-decoder architectures through the lens of Bayes risk
minimization for solving data-driven scientific machine learning problems. We
derive closed-form, rank-constrained linear and affine linear optimal mappings
for forward modeling and inverse recovery tasks. Our results generalize
existing formulations by accommodating rank-deficiencies in data, forward
operators, and measurement processes. We validate our theoretical results by
conducting numerical experiments on datasets from simple biomedical imaging,
financial factor analysis, and simulations involving nonlinear fluid dynamics
via the shallow water equations. This work provides a robust baseline for
understanding and benchmarking learned neural network models for scientific
machine learning problems.

Motivation: 现有方法在整合文本语义与图结构信息时存在困难，尤其是在处理领域术语、长程依赖、时间演化和大规模数据时表现不佳。

Method: 结合TAPE框架与ChatGPT生成语义解释，通过Graphormer的路径感知位置编码和多头注意力机制捕捉长程依赖，并设计集成层融合语义与结构特征。

Conclusion: 该框架为动态TAGs中的节点分类提供了可扩展且鲁棒的解决方案，为知识系统和科学发现的研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Textual Attribute Graphs (TAGs) are critical for modeling complex networks
like citation networks, but effective node classification remains challenging
due to difficulties in integrating rich semantics from text with structural
graph information. Existing methods often struggle with capturing nuanced
domain-specific terminology, modeling long-range dependencies, adapting to
temporal evolution, and scaling to massive datasets. To address these issues,
we propose a novel framework that integrates TAPE (Text-Attributed Graph
Representation Enhancement) with Graphormer. Our approach leverages a large
language model (LLM), specifically ChatGPT, within the TAPE framework to
generate semantically rich explanations from paper content, which are then
fused into enhanced node representations. These embeddings are combined with
structural features using a novel integration layer with learned attention
weights. Graphormer's path-aware position encoding and multi-head attention
mechanisms are employed to effectively capture long-range dependencies across
the citation network. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on the
challenging ogbn-arxiv dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a
classification accuracy of 0.772, significantly surpassing the best GCN
baseline of 0.713. Our method also yields strong results in precision (0.671),
recall (0.577), and F1-score (0.610). We validate our approach through
comprehensive ablation studies that quantify the contribution of each
component, demonstrating the synergy between semantic and structural
information. Our framework provides a scalable and robust solution for node
classification in dynamic TAGs, offering a promising direction for future
research in knowledge systems and scientific discovery.

Motivation: 传统避碰策略通常在接近碰撞时间（TCA）前24小时启动，可能导致燃料浪费。本研究旨在通过早期决策优化燃料消耗和碰撞风险。

Method: 采用连续状态、离散动作和有限时域的MDP模型，结合碰撞风险、燃料消耗和轨道几何的分析模型，通过RL-PG算法训练策略。

Result: 在合成和历史碰撞事件中，训练策略显著降低了平均燃料消耗，同时保持了与传统策略相当的碰撞风险保障。

Conclusion: 该框架在优化燃料消耗和碰撞风险方面表现出色，为自主避碰决策提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This work presents a Markov decision process (MDP) framework to model
decision-making for collision avoidance maneuver (CAM) and a reinforcement
learning policy gradient (RL-PG) algorithm to train an autonomous guidance
policy using historic CAM data. In addition to maintaining acceptable collision
risks, this approach seeks to minimize the average fuel consumption of CAMs by
making early maneuver decisions. We model CAM as a continuous state, discrete
action and finite horizon MDP, where the critical decision is determining when
to initiate the maneuver. The MDP model also incorporates analytical models for
conjunction risk, propellant consumption, and transit orbit geometry. The
Markov policy effectively trades-off maneuver delay-which improves the
reliability of conjunction risk indicators-with propellant consumption-which
increases with decreasing maneuver time. Using historical data of tracked
conjunction events, we verify this framework and conduct an extensive ablation
study on the hyper-parameters used within the MDP. On synthetic conjunction
events, the trained policy significantly minimizes both the overall and average
propellant consumption per CAM when compared to a conventional cut-off policy
that initiates maneuvers 24 hours before the time of closest approach (TCA). On
historical conjunction events, the trained policy consumes more propellant
overall but reduces the average propellant consumption per CAM. For both
historical and synthetic conjunction events, the trained policy achieves equal
if not higher overall collision risk guarantees.

Abstract: The research paper addresses decomposition of a stochastic time series into
three time series representing a dual signal i.e., the mean and the dispersion,
with noise isolated. Decomposition is done by applying machine learning to fit
a dual signal. Machine learning minimizes the loss function which compromises
between fitting the original time series and penalizing irregularities of the
dual signal. The latter includes terms based on the first and second order
derivatives along time. To preserve special patterns, weighting of the
regularization components of the loss function has been introduced based on
Statistical Process Control methodology. The proposed decomposition can be
applied as a smoothing algorithm against the mean and dispersion of the time
series. By isolating noise, the proposed decomposition can be seen as a
denoising algorithm. Two approaches of the learning process have been
considered: sequential and jointly. The former approach learns the mean signal
first and then dispersion. The latter approach fits the dual signal jointly.
Jointly learning can uncover complex relationships for the time series with
heteroskedasticity. Learning has been set by solving the direct non-linear
unconstrained optimization problem or by applying neural networks that have
sequential or twin output architectures. Tuning of the loss function
hyperparameters focuses on the isolated noise to be a stationary stochastic
process without autocorrelation properties. Depending on the applications, the
hyperparameters of the learning can be tuned towards either the discrete states
by stepped signal or smoothed series. The decomposed dual signal can be
represented on the 2D space and used to learn inherent structures, to forecast
both mean and dispersion, or to analyze cross effects in case of multiple time
series.

Conclusion: 研究表明，条件数而非网络深度是科学神经求解器的瓶颈，简单的架构改变可带来显著提升。

Abstract: Accuracy in neural PDE solvers often breaks down not because of limited
expressivity, but due to poor optimisation caused by ill-conditioning,
especially in multi-fidelity and stiff problems. We study this issue in
Physics-Informed Extreme Learning Machines (PIELMs), a convex variant of neural
PDE solvers, and show that asymptotic components in governing equations can
produce highly ill-conditioned activation matrices, severely limiting
convergence. We introduce Shifted Gaussian Encoding, a simple yet effective
activation filtering step that increases matrix rank and expressivity while
preserving convexity. Our method extends the solvable range of Peclet numbers
in steady advection-diffusion equations by over two orders of magnitude,
achieves up to six orders lower error on multi-frequency function learning, and
fits high-fidelity image vectors more accurately and faster than deep networks
with over a million parameters. This work highlights that conditioning, not
depth, is often the bottleneck in scientific neural solvers and that simple
architectural changes can unlock substantial gains.

Abstract: Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a key technique for training
large reasoning models, yet it suffers from a critical vulnerability: the
\emph{Think-Answer Mismatch}, where noisy reward signals corrupt the learning
process. This problem is most severe in unbalanced response groups,
paradoxically degrading the signal precisely when it should be most
informative. To address this challenge, we propose Stable Group-Relative Policy
Optimization (S-GRPO), a principled enhancement that derives optimal,
noise-aware advantage weights to stabilize training. Our comprehensive
experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate S-GRPO's
effectiveness and robustness. On various models, S-GRPO significantly
outperforms DR. GRPO, achieving performance gains of +2.5% on
Qwen-Math-7B-Base, +2.2% on Llama-3.2-3B-Base, and +2.4% on

Abstract: Decision trees, without appropriate constraints, can easily become overly
complex and prone to overfit, capturing noise rather than generalizable
patterns. To resolve this problem,pruning operation is a crucial part in
optimizing decision trees, as it not only reduces the complexity of trees but
also decreases the probability of generating overfit models. The conventional
pruning techniques like Cost-Complexity Pruning (CCP) and Reduced Error Pruning
(REP) are mostly based on greedy approaches that focus on immediate gains in
performance while pruning nodes of the decision tree. However, this might
result in a lower generalization in the long run, compromising the robust
ability of the tree model when introduced to unseen data samples, particularly
when trained with small and complex datasets. To address this challenge, we are
proposing a Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB)-based pruning approach, a reinforcement
learning (RL)-based technique, that will dynamically prune the tree to generate
an optimal decision tree with better generalization. Our proposed approach
assumes the pruning process as an exploration-exploitation problem, where we
are utilizing the MAB algorithms to find optimal branch nodes to prune based on
feedback from each pruning actions. Experimental evaluation on several
benchmark datasets, demonstrated that our proposed approach results in better
predictive performance compared to the traditional ones. This suggests the
potential of utilizing MAB for a dynamic and probabilistic way of decision tree
pruning, in turn optimizing the decision tree-based model.

TL;DR: ASAP是一种新颖的CoT压缩框架，通过锚点引导和基于意外性的剪枝方法，显著降低了推理延迟和训练成本，同时保持了高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CoT压缩方法在保持逻辑连贯性和捕捉关键推理步骤方面存在不足，亟需一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: ASAP采用粗到细的框架，先通过锚点引导剪枝保留核心推理结构，再基于第一标记意外性选择逻辑关键步骤，并训练模型自主生成简洁CoT。

Result: 在多个代码生成基准测试中，ASAP实现了最高准确性，并在LiveCodeBench v4_v5上减少了23.5%的token生成和43.5%的推理延迟。

Conclusion: ASAP为构建高效且强大的大型推理模型提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Recently, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in code reasoning by scaling up the length of Chain-of-Thought
(CoT). However, excessively long reasoning traces introduce substantial
challenges in terms of training cost, inference latency, and deployment
feasibility. While various CoT compression approaches have emerged to address
this challenge, they face inherent trade-offs: token-level methods often
disrupt syntactic and logical coherence, while step-level methods based on
perplexity fail to reliably capture the logically critical reasoning steps. In
this paper, we propose ASAP (Anchor-guided, Surprisal-based Pruning), a novel
coarse-to-fine framework for CoT compression. ASAP first performs anchor-guided
pruning to preserve the core reasoning structure, which efficiently reduces the
search space for subsequent processing. It then enables a logic-aware pruning
by selecting logically essential reasoning steps based on a novel first-token
surprisal metric. Finally, ASAP teaches models to autonomously generate and
leverage these concise CoTs at inference time, enabling efficient reasoning in
coding tasks. Experiments show that ASAP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
across multiple code generation benchmarks while substantially reducing
training and inference costs. On the challenging LiveCodeBench v4_v5 benchmark,
our approach reduces token generation by 23.5% and inference latency by 43.5%
compared to the strongest baseline, while achieving a competitive accuracy of
36.19% in Pass@1. Our results highlight a promising direction for building
powerful and efficient LRMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习面临分布偏移问题，导致过估计或性能受限，需要一种平衡方法。

Method: 提出MCRE框架，结合TD误差和行为克隆项，并开发MCRQ算法，集成到离线策略actor-critic框架中。

Result: 实验表明MCRQ在基准数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MCRE和MCRQ有效平衡了保守性与性能，提升了离线强化学习的效果。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) seeks to learn optimal policies from
static datasets without further environment interaction. A key challenge is the
distribution shift between the learned and behavior policies, leading to
out-of-distribution (OOD) actions and overestimation. To prevent gross
overestimation, the value function must remain conservative; however, excessive
conservatism may hinder performance improvement. To address this, we propose
the mildly conservative regularized evaluation (MCRE) framework, which balances
conservatism and performance by combining temporal difference (TD) error with a
behavior cloning term in the Bellman backup. Building on this, we develop the
mildly conservative regularized Q-learning (MCRQ) algorithm, which integrates
MCRE into an off-policy actor-critic framework. Experiments show that MCRQ
outperforms strong baselines and state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms on
benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: 该方法展示了语言嵌入空间与传统欧几里得空间的相关性，为自然语言目标与智能体行为的对齐提供了新思路，并为大语言模型与控制应用的结合奠定了基础。

Abstract: In the domain of scientific machine learning, designing effective reward
functions remains a challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in
environments where task goals are difficult to specify numerically. Reward
functions in existing work are predominantly based on heuristics, manual
engineering, or task-specific tuning. In this work, we introduce a semantically
aligned reinforcement learning method where rewards are computed by aligning
the current state with a target semantic instruction using a
Sentence-Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (SBERT).
Instead of relying on manually defined reward functions, the policy receives
feedback based on the reward, which is a cosine similarity between the goal
textual description and the statement description in the episode. We evaluated
our approach in several environments and showed that semantic reward can guide
learning to achieve competitive control behavior, even in the absence of
hand-crafted reward functions. Our study demonstrates a correlation between the
language embedding space and the conventional Euclidean space. This framework
opens new horizons for aligning agent behavior with natural language goals and
lays the groundwork for a more seamless integration of larger language models
(LLMs) and fluid control applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种方法，通过重新定义误差为非线性扰动的线性递归，并结合半范数收缩与诱导范数的单调性，首次实现了参数无关的$\tilde{O}(1/\sqrt{t})$最优收敛速率，适用于平均奖励和指数折扣场景下的$Q$-学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非线性固定点方程（如平均奖励$Q$-学习和TD学习）的求解算法通常涉及半范数收缩，但由于半范数的非单调性，实现参数无关的最优收敛速率一直是一个挑战。

Method: 通过将平均误差重新定义为非线性扰动的线性递归，并利用半范数收缩与诱导范数单调性的耦合，来克服非线性问题。

Result: 首次实现了参数无关的$\tilde{O}(1/\sqrt{t})$最优收敛速率，适用于多种场景（如同步/异步更新、单智能体/分布式部署、模拟器或马尔可夫轨迹数据流）。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了非线性固定点方程求解中的空白，为$Q$-学习提供了广泛适用的最优收敛速率解决方案。

Abstract: Algorithms for solving \textit{nonlinear} fixed-point equations -- such as
average-reward \textit{$Q$-learning} and \textit{TD-learning} -- often involve
semi-norm contractions. Achieving parameter-free optimal convergence rates for
these methods via Polyak--Ruppert averaging has remained elusive, largely due
to the non-monotonicity of such semi-norms. We close this gap by (i.) recasting
the averaged error as a linear recursion involving a nonlinear perturbation,
and (ii.) taming the nonlinearity by coupling the semi-norm's contraction with
the monotonicity of a suitably induced norm. Our main result yields the first
parameter-free $\tilde{O}(1/\sqrt{t})$ optimal rates for $Q$-learning in both
average-reward and exponentially discounted settings, where $t$ denotes the
iteration index. The result applies within a broad framework that accommodates
synchronous and asynchronous updates, single-agent and distributed deployments,
and data streams obtained either from simulators or along Markovian
trajectories.

Conclusion: 结合符号规划与LLMs在复杂领域中具有潜力，能实现更鲁棒、高质量的代码生成。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
code generation and structured reasoning; however, their performance often
degrades on complex tasks that require consistent multi-step planning. Recent
work has explored combining LLMs with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), yet
existing approaches primarily focus on generating heuristic-based code for
optimization or target simpler tasks where correctness alone is sufficient. In
this work, we propose MCTS-OPS, a novel neural-symbolic framework that
formulates prompt selection as a sequential decision process guided by MCTS.
Our method explores and refines multi-step prompt sequences for the goal of
improving code generation quality and enhancing the problem-solving
capabilities of LLMs in general optimization. Experiments on network
optimization show significant improvement over the baselines, both in the
success rate of executing the generated code and in the optimization results
with the specified objective and constraints (2$\sim$4$\times$ higher reward
and 3$\times$ lower standard deviation). Moreover, it improves the chance of
attaining the optimal solution by about 10\% of cases, compared to baseline
methods in hard problems. These results highlight the promise of combining
symbolic planning with LLMs for robust, high-quality code generation in complex
domains.

Conclusion: 该模型可推广至多阶段特征收集场景，适用于其他动态预测任务，帮助确定新特征何时对预测有益。

Abstract: Prognostication for comatose post-cardiac arrest patients is a critical
challenge that directly impacts clinical decision-making in the ICU. Clinical
information that informs prognostication is collected serially over time.
Shortly after cardiac arrest, various time-invariant baseline features are
collected (e.g., demographics, cardiac arrest characteristics). After ICU
admission, additional features are gathered, including time-varying hemodynamic
data (e.g., blood pressure, doses of vasopressor medications). We view these as
two phases in which we collect new features. In this study, we propose a novel
stepwise dynamic competing risks model that improves the prediction of
neurological outcomes by automatically determining when to take advantage of
time-invariant features (first phase) and time-varying features (second phase).
Notably, our model finds patients for whom this second phase (time-varying
hemodynamic) information is beneficial for prognostication and also when this
information is beneficial (as we collect more hemodynamic data for a patient
over time, how important these data are for prognostication varies). Our
approach extends the standard Fine and Gray model to explicitly model the two
phases and to incorporate neural networks to flexibly capture complex nonlinear
feature relationships. Evaluated on a retrospective cohort of 2,278 comatose
post-arrest patients, our model demonstrates robust discriminative performance
for the competing outcomes of awakening, withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy,
and death despite maximal support. Our approach generalizes to more than two
phases in which new features are collected and could be used in other dynamic
prediction tasks, where it may be helpful to know when and for whom newly
collected features significantly improve prediction.

Result: 在七个真实世界图和二十个基线上的实验表明，AHGNN在高异质性情况下表现优越。

Conclusion: AHGNN有效解决了异质性HG建模的挑战，为实际应用提供了高性能解决方案。

Abstract: Heterogeneous graphs (HGs) are common in real-world scenarios and often
exhibit heterophily. However, most existing studies focus on either
heterogeneity or heterophily in isolation, overlooking the prevalence of
heterophilic HGs in practical applications. Such ignorance leads to their
performance degradation. In this work, we first identify two main challenges in
modeling heterophily HGs: (1) varying heterophily distributions across hops and
meta-paths; (2) the intricate and often heterophily-driven diversity of
semantic information across different meta-paths. Then, we propose the Adaptive
Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (AHGNN) to tackle these challenges. AHGNN
employs a heterophily-aware convolution that accounts for heterophily
distributions specific to both hops and meta-paths. It then integrates messages
from diverse semantic spaces using a coarse-to-fine attention mechanism, which
filters out noise and emphasizes informative signals. Experiments on seven
real-world graphs and twenty baselines demonstrate the superior performance of
AHGNN, particularly in high-heterophily situations.

Result: 实验表明，DP-LLM在多个模型和基准测试中表现优异，性能与延迟权衡优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DP-LLM通过动态精度分配，显著提升了大型语言模型的适应性和效率。

Abstract: How can we effectively handle queries for on-device large language models
(LLMs) with varying runtime constraints, such as latency and accuracy?
Multi-scale quantization addresses this challenge by enabling memory-efficient
runtime model adaptation of LLMs through the overlaying of multiple model
variants quantized to different bitwidths. Meanwhile, an important question
still remains open-ended: how can models be properly configured to match a
target precision or latency? While mixed-precision offers a promising solution,
we take this further by leveraging the key observation that the sensitivity of
each layer dynamically changes across decoding iterations. Building on this
insight, we introduce DP-LLM, a novel mechanism that dynamically assigns
precision to each layer based on input values. DP-LLM augments each linear
layer in an LLM with a precision selector that determines the bitwidth at
runtime using a lightweight error estimator and threshold values learned
through fine-tuning. Experimental results across multiple models and benchmarks
demonstrate that DP-LLM achieves a superior performance-latency trade-off,
outperforming prior approaches.

Motivation: 当前对深度时间模型的泛化理论理解有限，论文旨在填补这一空白，提供理论边界和评估方法。

Method: 通过延迟反馈阻断机制将依赖样本转化为独立样本，推导出泛化边界，并设计公平比较方法固定有效样本量。

Result: 强依赖序列的泛化差距比弱依赖序列小76%，但收敛速度与理论预测不符（弱依赖为$N_{\text{eff}}^{-1.21}$，强依赖为$N_{\text{eff}}^{-0.89}$）。

Conclusion: 时间依赖性可以提升学习效果，但理论与实践的差异表明未来研究需进一步探索。

Abstract: Deep temporal architectures such as Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs)
achieve strong predictive performance on sequential data, yet theoretical
understanding of their generalization remains limited. We address this gap by
providing both the first non-vacuous, architecture-aware generalization bounds
for deep temporal models and a principled evaluation methodology.
  For exponentially $\beta$-mixing sequences, we derive bounds scaling as $
O\!\Bigl(R\,\sqrt{\tfrac{D\,p\,n\,\log N}{N}}\Bigr), $ where $D$ is network
depth, $p$ kernel size, $n$ input dimension, and $R$ weight norm. Our
delayed-feedback blocking mechanism transforms dependent samples into
effectively independent ones while discarding only $O(1/\log N)$ of the data,
yielding $\sqrt{D}$ scaling instead of exponential, implying that doubling
depth requires approximately quadrupling the training data.
  We also introduce a fair-comparison methodology that fixes the effective
sample size to isolate the effect of temporal structure from information
content. Under $N_{\text{eff}}=2{,}000$, strongly dependent sequences
($\rho=0.8$) exhibit $\approx76\%$ smaller generalization gaps than weakly
dependent ones ($\rho=0.2$), challenging the intuition that dependence is
purely detrimental. Yet convergence rates diverge from theory: weak
dependencies follow $N_{\text{eff}}^{-1.21}$ scaling and strong dependencies
follow $N_{\text{eff}}^{-0.89}$, both steeper than the predicted $N^{-0.5}$.
These findings reveal that temporal dependence can enhance learning under fixed
information budgets, while highlighting gaps between theory and practice that
motivate future research.

Method: 提出HGR技术，结合后见目标生成动作正则化先验，并与后见自我模仿正则化（HSR）结合，最大化经验利用率。

Result: 在导航和操作任务中，HGR显著提高了样本重用效率，性能优于现有GCRL方法。

Conclusion: HGR通过更高效的经验利用，为稀疏奖励GCRL提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) with sparse rewards remains a
fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning. While hindsight experience
replay (HER) has shown promise by relabeling collected trajectories with
achieved goals, we argue that trajectory relabeling alone does not fully
exploit the available experiences in off-policy GCRL methods, resulting in
limited sample efficiency. In this paper, we propose Hindsight Goal-conditioned
Regularization (HGR), a technique that generates action regularization priors
based on hindsight goals. When combined with hindsight self-imitation
regularization (HSR), our approach enables off-policy RL algorithms to maximize
experience utilization. Compared to existing GCRL methods that employ HER and
self-imitation techniques, our hindsight regularizations achieve substantially
more efficient sample reuse and the best performances, which we empirically
demonstrate on a suite of navigation and manipulation tasks.

Abstract: In oral cancer diagnostics, the limited availability of annotated datasets
frequently constrains the performance of diagnostic models, particularly due to
the variability and insufficiency of training data. To address these
challenges, this study proposed a novel approach to enhance diagnostic accuracy
by synthesizing realistic oral cancer lesions using an inpainting technique
with a fine-tuned diffusion model. We compiled a comprehensive dataset from
multiple sources, featuring a variety of oral cancer images. Our method
generated synthetic lesions that exhibit a high degree of visual fidelity to
actual lesions, thereby significantly enhancing the performance of diagnostic
algorithms. The results show that our classification model achieved a
diagnostic accuracy of 0.97 in differentiating between cancerous and
non-cancerous tissues, while our detection model accurately identified lesion
locations with 0.85 accuracy. This method validates the potential for synthetic
image generation in medical diagnostics and paves the way for further research

Result: 实验表明，RR-Cluster显著提升了隐私与效用的权衡效果。

Conclusion: RR-Cluster是一种简单有效的技术，可提升联邦聚类算法的隐私保护能力。

Abstract: Federated clustering aims to group similar clients into clusters and produce
one model for each cluster. Such a personalization approach typically improves
model performance compared with training a single model to serve all clients,
but can be more vulnerable to privacy leakage. Directly applying client-level
differentially private (DP) mechanisms to federated clustering could degrade
the utilities significantly. We identify that such deficiencies are mainly due
to the difficulties of averaging privacy noise within each cluster (following
standard privacy mechanisms), as the number of clients assigned to the same
clusters is uncontrolled. To this end, we propose a simple and effective
technique, named RR-Cluster, that can be viewed as a light-weight add-on to
many federated clustering algorithms. RR-Cluster achieves reduced privacy noise
via randomly rebalancing cluster assignments, guaranteeing a minimum number of
clients assigned to each cluster. We analyze the tradeoffs between decreased
privacy noise variance and potentially increased bias from incorrect
assignments and provide convergence bounds for RR-Clsuter. Empirically, we
demonstrate the RR-Cluster plugged into strong federated clustering algorithms
results in significantly improved privacy/utility tradeoffs across both
synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: GFed-PP为联邦推荐系统中不同隐私偏好提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Federated recommendation systems (FedRecs) have gained significant attention
for providing privacy-preserving recommendation services. However, existing
FedRecs assume that all users have the same requirements for privacy
protection, i.e., they do not upload any data to the server. The approaches
overlook the potential to enhance the recommendation service by utilizing
publicly available user data. In real-world applications, users can choose to
be private or public. Private users' interaction data is not shared, while
public users' interaction data can be shared. Inspired by the issue, this paper
proposes a novel Graph Federated Learning for Personalized Privacy
Recommendation (GFed-PP) that adapts to different privacy requirements while
improving recommendation performance. GFed-PP incorporates the interaction data
of public users to build a user-item interaction graph, which is then used to
form a user relationship graph. A lightweight graph convolutional network (GCN)
is employed to learn each user's user-specific personalized item embedding. To
protect user privacy, each client learns the user embedding and the scoring
function locally. Additionally, GFed-PP achieves optimization of the federated
recommendation framework through the initialization of item embedding on
clients and the aggregation of the user relationship graph on the server.
Experimental results demonstrate that GFed-PP significantly outperforms

### [173] [Reparameterization Proximal Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06214)
*Hai Zhong,Xun Wang,Zhuoran Li,Longbo Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种稳定的重参数化策略梯度方法（RPO），通过结合PPO的代理目标和KL正则化，解决了RPG训练不稳定的问题，并在实验中表现出高效和强性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重参数化策略梯度（RPG）虽然能提高样本效率，但训练不稳定，高方差梯度会破坏学习过程。

Method: 通过建立RPG与PPO代理目标的联系，提出RPO方法，利用时间反向传播计算梯度，并结合KL正则化和裁剪代理目标实现稳定训练。

Result: 在运动和操作任务中，RPO表现出更高的样本效率和更强的性能。

Conclusion: RPO是一种稳定且高效的RPG方法，适用于复杂任务。

Abstract: Reparameterization policy gradient (RPG) is promising for improving sample
efficiency by leveraging differentiable dynamics. However, a critical barrier
is its training instability, where high-variance gradients can destabilize the
learning process. To address this, we draw inspiration from Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO), which uses a surrogate objective to enable stable sample
reuse in the model-free setting. We first establish a connection between this
surrogate objective and RPG, which has been largely unexplored and is
non-trivial. Then, we bridge this gap by demonstrating that the
reparameterization gradient of a PPO-like surrogate objective can be computed
efficiently using backpropagation through time. Based on this key insight, we
propose Reparameterization Proximal Policy Optimization (RPO), a stable and
sample-efficient RPG-based method. RPO enables multiple epochs of stable sample
reuse by optimizing a clipped surrogate objective tailored for RPG, while being
further stabilized by Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence regularization and
remaining fully compatible with existing variance reduction methods. We
evaluate RPO on a suite of challenging locomotion and manipulation tasks, where
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior sample efficiency and
strong performance.

*Gaurav Deshkar,Jayanta Kshirsagar,Harshal Hayatnagarkar,Janani Venugopalan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于DDPG的政策优化框架，用于在大规模流行病模拟中自动确定最优干预措施，以平衡健康和经济目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在模拟目标、规模和干预策略探索方面存在局限性，无法有效解决疫情干预的复杂性问题。

Method: 采用DDPG框架，结合大规模（10万个体）流行病学基于代理的模拟，进行多目标优化。

Result: 在无封锁和针对中老年人群接种疫苗的情况下，实现了经济（贫困线以下人口）与健康目标（感染和住院）的平衡。

Conclusion: 研究为疫情干预提供了新方法，但需进一步验证和开源框架。

Abstract: To mitigate the impact of the pandemic, several measures include lockdowns,
rapid vaccination programs, school closures, and economic stimulus. These
interventions can have positive or unintended negative consequences. Current
research to model and determine an optimal intervention automatically through
round-tripping is limited by the simulation objectives, scale (a few thousand
individuals), model types that are not suited for intervention studies, and the
number of intervention strategies they can explore (discrete vs continuous). We
address these challenges using a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
based policy optimization framework on a large-scale (100,000 individual)
epidemiological agent-based simulation where we perform multi-objective
optimization. We determine the optimal policy for lockdown and vaccination in a
minimalist age-stratified multi-vaccine scenario with a basic simulation for
economic activity. With no lockdown and vaccination (mid-age and elderly),
results show optimal economy (individuals below the poverty line) with balanced
health objectives (infection, and hospitalization). An in-depth simulation is
needed to further validate our results and open-source our framework.

*Xurun Wang,Guangrui Liu,Xinjie Li,Haoyu He,Lin Yao,Weizhe Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了部分特征成员推理攻击（PFMI），提出了一种两阶段攻击框架MRAD，通过优化未知特征值和异常检测来推断样本是否在训练集中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有成员推理攻击方法通常假设攻击者能访问目标样本的全部特征，但在实际场景中往往只能获取部分特征，限制了方法的适用性。

Method: 提出MRAD框架：第一阶段优化未知特征值以最小化样本损失，第二阶段通过异常检测衡量重构样本与训练分布的偏差。

Result: 实验表明MRAD在多个数据集上有效，例如在STL-10上即使缺失40%特征，AUC仍可达0.6。

Conclusion: MRAD解决了部分特征场景下的成员推理问题，兼容多种异常检测技术，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Machine learning models have been shown to be susceptible to membership
inference attack, which can be used to determine whether a given sample appears
in the training data. Existing membership inference methods commonly assume
that the adversary has full access to the features of the target sample. This
assumption, however, does not hold in many real-world scenarios where only
partial features information is available, thereby limiting the applicability
of these methods. In this work, we study an inference scenario where the
adversary observes only partial features of each sample and aims to infer
whether this observed subset was present in the training set of the target
model. We define this problem as Partial Feature Membership Inference (PFMI).
To address this problem, we propose MRAD (Memory-guided Reconstruction and
Anomaly Detection), a two-stage attack framework. In the first stage, MRAD
optimizes the unknown feature values to minimize the loss of the sample. In the
second stage, it measures the deviation between the reconstructed sample and
the training distribution using anomaly detection. Empirical results
demonstrate that MRAD is effective across a range of datasets, and maintains
compatibility with various off-the-shelf anomaly detection techniques. For
example, on STL-10, our attack achieves an AUC of around 0.6 even with 40% of
the missing features.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AttriLens-Mol是一种基于属性引导的强化学习框架，用于提升大语言模型在分子属性预测任务中的表现，通过结构化输出和验证机制显著提高了预测效果和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在分子属性预测中依赖人工设计的提示和思维链模板，推理过程冗长且缺乏相关性，需要更高效的引导方法。

Method: 提出AttriLens-Mol框架，通过三种奖励机制（格式奖励、计数奖励和合理性奖励）引导模型生成相关分子属性，并利用强化学习优化推理过程。

Result: 在多个数据集上，AttriLens-Mol显著提升了7B规模模型的性能，优于监督微调模型和先进模型（如GPT-4o），提取的属性用于决策树模型时也表现更优。

Conclusion: AttriLens-Mol通过引导模型生成更相关的分子属性，显著提升了预测性能和可解释性，为分子属性预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in assisting molecular
property prediction tasks but often rely on human-crafted prompts and
chain-of-thought templates. While recent advanced large reasoning models like
DeepSeek-R1 employ reinforcement learning for an extended ``thinking'' process,
their reasoning can be verbose and lack relevance. We introduce AttriLens-Mol,
an attribute-guided reinforcement learning framework for molecular property
prediction with LLMs. AttriLens-Mol steers the model's reasoning by using: (1)
a format reward encouraging attribute-based structured output, (2) a count
reward to avoid enumerating irrelevant attributes, and (3) a rationality reward
using advanced LLMs and RDKit to verify the relatedness of the generated
attributes. This approach implicitly elicits the model's inherent knowledge of
relevant molecular attributes during reasoning, enables making predictions for
the molecular property more effectively. Experiments on both in-distribution
and out-of-distribution datasets show that, training both 7B-size
R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5 and R1-Distilled-LLaMA3.1 models on 4,000 samples with our
proposed AttriLens-Mol method significantly boosts the performance, getting
comparable or better results than supervised fine-tuning models
(Mol-Instructions, ChemDFM, etc.) and advanced models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o,
DeepSeek-V3, DeepSeek-R1, etc.). Further, our extracted attributes for the
target property, when used as features for an interpretable decision tree
model, yield superior performance compared to attributes generated by prompting
LLMs. This shows that AttriLens-Mol effectively elicits more relevant and
predictive molecular attributes, leading to enhanced interpretability and
performance for property prediction. We release the code in
https://github.com/szu-tera/AttriLens-Mol.

*Zichun Ye,Runqi Wang,Xutong Liu,Shuai Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CMOSS是一种高效算法，解决了组合多臂老虎机（CMAB）中UCB和对抗方法的不足，实现了无对数时间依赖的遗憾界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UCB方法（如CUCB）存在长期遗憾问题，而对抗方法（如EXP3.M和HYBRID）计算开销大。CMOSS旨在平衡这一矛盾。

Method: 提出CMOSS算法，适用于半强盗反馈和级联反馈，计算高效。

Result: CMOSS实现了实例无关的遗憾界$O((\log k)^2\sqrt{kmT})$，优于基准算法。

Conclusion: CMOSS在理论和实验中均表现出色，是CMAB问题的有效解决方案。

Abstract: The combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) is a cornerstone of sequential
decision-making framework, dominated by two algorithmic families: UCB-based and
adversarial methods such as follow the regularized leader (FTRL) and online
mirror descent (OMD). However, prominent UCB-based approaches like CUCB suffer
from additional regret factor $\log T$ that is detrimental over long horizons,
while adversarial methods such as EXP3.M and HYBRID impose significant
computational overhead. To resolve this trade-off, we introduce the
Combinatorial Minimax Optimal Strategy in the Stochastic setting (CMOSS). CMOSS
is a computationally efficient algorithm that achieves an instance-independent
regret of $O\big( (\log k)^2\sqrt{kmT}\big )$ under semi-bandit feedback, where
$m$ is the number of arms and $k$ is the maximum cardinality of a feasible
action. Crucially, this result eliminates the dependency on $\log T$ and
matches the established $\Omega\big( \sqrt{kmT}\big)$ lower bound up to
$O\big((\log k)^2\big)$. We then extend our analysis to show that CMOSS is also
applicable to cascading feedback. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets validate that CMOSS consistently outperforms benchmark algorithms in
both regret and runtime efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微调LLM可能导致模型在目标领域外表现出有害行为（EMA），即使通过API隐藏模型权重，攻击者仍可能无意中利用这种不对齐。研究旨在提供实用的训练保障措施。

Method: 研究了四种干预方法：(i) KL散度正则化，(ii) 特征空间的ℓ2距离，(iii) 安全子空间投影（SafeLoRA），(iv) 混合少量安全训练数据。

Result: 评估了这些方法在四个恶意任务中对EMA的抑制效果，以及对良性任务的影响。

Conclusion: 讨论了突发性不对齐研究中的开放性问题，为API暴露的微调提供了实用保障方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning lets practitioners repurpose aligned large language models (LLMs)
for new domains, yet recent work reveals emergent misalignment (EMA): Even a
small, domain-specific fine-tune can induce harmful behaviors far outside the
target domain. Even in the case where model weights are hidden behind a
fine-tuning API, this gives attackers inadvertent access to a broadly
misaligned model in a way that can be hard to detect from the fine-tuning data
alone. We present the first systematic study of in-training safeguards against
EMA that are practical for providers who expose fine-tuning via an API. We
investigate four training regularization interventions: (i) KL-divergence
regularization toward a safe reference model, (ii) $\ell_2$ distance in feature
space, (iii) projecting onto a safe subspace (SafeLoRA), and (iv) interleaving
of a small amount of safe training examples from a general instruct-tuning
dataset. We first evaluate the methods' emergent misalignment effect across
four malicious, EMA-inducing tasks. Second, we assess the methods' impacts on
benign tasks. We conclude with a discussion of open questions in emergent
misalignment research.

Conclusion: MPS是隐私感知合成数据生成的有前景工具，结合张量网络表达能力和隐私机制，为安全数据共享提供了可解释且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Synthetic data generation is a key technique in modern artificial
intelligence, addressing data scarcity, privacy constraints, and the need for
diverse datasets in training robust models. In this work, we propose a method
for generating privacy-preserving high-quality synthetic tabular data using
Tensor Networks, specifically Matrix Product States (MPS). We benchmark the
MPS-based generative model against state-of-the-art models such as CTGAN, VAE,
and PrivBayes, focusing on both fidelity and privacy-preserving capabilities.
To ensure differential privacy (DP), we integrate noise injection and gradient
clipping during training, enabling privacy guarantees via R\'enyi Differential
Privacy accounting. Across multiple metrics analyzing data fidelity and
downstream machine learning task performance, our results show that MPS
outperforms classical models, particularly under strict privacy constraints.
This work highlights MPS as a promising tool for privacy-aware synthetic data
generation. By combining the expressive power of tensor network representations
with formal privacy mechanisms, the proposed approach offers an interpretable
and scalable alternative for secure data sharing. Its structured design
facilitates integration into sensitive domains where both data quality and
confidentiality are critical.

Motivation: 现有方法在多组学数据整合中忽略了异质性组学间的复杂耦合，限制了其在精准肿瘤学中解析癌症亚型异质性的能力。

Method: GTMancer框架基于图神经网络优化问题，利用对比学习将多组学数据嵌入统一语义空间，并通过双重注意力系数捕捉组学内和组学间的结构图先验。

Result: 在七个真实癌症数据集上的实验表明，GTMancer优于现有最先进算法。

Conclusion: GTMancer通过整合多组学数据并优化图结构，显著提升了癌症亚型分类的准确性。

Abstract: Integrating multi-omics datasets through data-driven analysis offers a
comprehensive understanding of the complex biological processes underlying
various diseases, particularly cancer. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have
recently demonstrated remarkable ability to exploit relational structures in
biological data, enabling advances in multi-omics integration for cancer
subtype classification. Existing approaches often neglect the intricate
coupling between heterogeneous omics, limiting their capacity to resolve subtle
cancer subtype heterogeneity critical for precision oncology. To address these
limitations, we propose a framework named Graph Transformer for Multi-omics
Cancer Subtype Classification (GTMancer). This framework builds upon the GNN
optimization problem and extends its application to complex multi-omics data.
Specifically, our method leverages contrastive learning to embed multi-omics
data into a unified semantic space. We unroll the multiplex graph optimization
problem in that unified space and introduce dual sets of attention coefficients
to capture structural graph priors both within and among multi-omics data. This
approach enables global omics information to guide the refining of the
representations of individual omics. Empirical experiments on seven real-world
cancer datasets demonstrate that GTMancer outperforms existing state-of-the-art
algorithms.

Motivation: 生成模型（如扩散和流模型）在离线多智能体强化学习中采样效率低，难以应用于时间敏感或资源受限的场景。

Method: 提出OM2P算法，结合奖励感知优化、均值流匹配损失和Q函数监督，设计广义时间步分布和无导数估计策略。

Result: 在Multi-Agent Particle和MuJoCo基准测试中，OM2P性能优越，GPU内存使用减少3.8倍，训练速度提升10.8倍。

Conclusion: OM2P首次成功将均值流模型集成到离线MARL中，为多智能体合作场景中的实用生成策略铺平了道路。

Abstract: Generative models, especially diffusion and flow-based models, have been
promising in offline multi-agent reinforcement learning. However, integrating
powerful generative models into this framework poses unique challenges. In
particular, diffusion and flow-based policies suffer from low sampling
efficiency due to their iterative generation processes, making them impractical
in time-sensitive or resource-constrained settings. To tackle these
difficulties, we propose OM2P (Offline Multi-Agent Mean-Flow Policy), a novel
offline MARL algorithm to achieve efficient one-step action sampling. To
address the misalignment between generative objectives and reward maximization,
we introduce a reward-aware optimization scheme that integrates a
carefully-designed mean-flow matching loss with Q-function supervision.
Additionally, we design a generalized timestep distribution and a
derivative-free estimation strategy to reduce memory overhead and improve
training stability. Empirical evaluations on Multi-Agent Particle and MuJoCo
benchmarks demonstrate that OM2P achieves superior performance, with up to a
3.8x reduction in GPU memory usage and up to a 10.8x speed-up in training time.
Our approach represents the first to successfully integrate mean-flow model
into offline MARL, paving the way for practical and scalable generative
policies in cooperative multi-agent settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度语言的多样性为开发包容性ASR系统带来挑战，传统多语言模型因数据顺序到达和隐私限制而不适用。

Method: 使用基于Conformer的混合RNN-T/CTC模型，从印地语预训练开始，逐步学习八种印度语言。评估了三种CL策略：EWC、MAS和LwF。

Result: 结果表明CL能有效减少遗忘，优于简单微调，适用于现实约束下的印度语言ASR扩展。

Conclusion: 持续学习是解决印度语言ASR系统扩展问题的有效方法。

Abstract: Indias linguistic diversity poses significant challenges for developing
inclusive Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. Traditional multilingual
models, which require simultaneous access to all language data, are impractical
due to the sequential arrival of data and privacy constraints. Continual
Learning (CL) offers a solution by enabling models to learn new languages
sequentially without catastrophically forgetting previously learned knowledge.
This paper investigates CL for ASR on Indian languages using a subset of the
IndicSUPERB benchmark. We employ a Conformer-based hybrid RNN-T/CTC model,
initially pretrained on Hindi, which is then incrementally trained on eight
additional Indian languages, for a total sequence of nine languages. We
evaluate three prominent regularization- and distillation-based CL strategies:
Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), Memory Aware Synapses (MAS), and Learning
without Forgetting (LwF), selected for their suitability in no-replay,
privacy-conscious scenarios. Performance is analyzed using Word Error Rate
(WER) for both RNN-T and CTC paths on clean and noisy data, as well as
knowledge retention via Backward Transfer. We also explore the impact of
varying the number of training epochs (1, 2, 5, and 10) per task. Results,
compared against naive fine-tuning, demonstrate CLs effectiveness in mitigating
forgetting, making it a promising approach for scalable ASR in diverse Indian
languages under realistic constraints. The code is available at:

Conclusion: 提出的复位机制克服了不稳定性，扩展了深度SSM的应用范围，提升了SNN的潜力。

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing is an emerging technology enabling low-latency and
energy-efficient signal processing. A key algorithmic tool in neuromorphic
computing is spiking neural networks (SNNs). SNNs are biologically inspired
neural networks which utilize stateful neurons, and provide low-bit data
processing by encoding and decoding information using spikes. Similar to SNNs,
deep state-space models (SSMs) utilize stateful building blocks. However, deep
SSMs, which recently achieved competitive performance in various temporal
modeling tasks, are typically designed with high-precision activation functions
and no reset mechanisms. To bridge the gains offered by SNNs and the recent
deep SSM models, we propose a novel multiple-output spiking neuron model that
combines a linear, general SSM state transition with a non-linear feedback
mechanism through reset. Compared to the existing neuron models for SNNs, our
proposed model clearly conceptualizes the differences between the spiking
function, the reset condition and the reset action. The experimental results on
various tasks, i.e., a keyword spotting task, an event-based vision task and a
sequential pattern recognition task, show that our proposed model achieves
performance comparable to existing benchmarks in the SNN literature. Our
results illustrate how the proposed reset mechanism can overcome instability
and enable learning even when the linear part of neuron dynamics is unstable,
allowing us to go beyond the strictly enforced stability of linear dynamics in
recent deep SSM models.

Result: 实验显示FedMeNF在少样本或非IID数据下仍能快速优化并保持鲁棒的重建性能，同时保护隐私。

Conclusion: FedMeNF是一种高效且隐私安全的联邦元学习方法，适用于多模态数据场景。

Abstract: Neural fields provide a memory-efficient representation of data, which can
effectively handle diverse modalities and large-scale data. However, learning
to map neural fields often requires large amounts of training data and
computations, which can be limited to resource-constrained edge devices. One
approach to tackle this limitation is to leverage Federated Meta-Learning
(FML), but traditional FML approaches suffer from privacy leakage. To address
these issues, we introduce a novel FML approach called FedMeNF. FedMeNF
utilizes a new privacy-preserving loss function that regulates privacy leakage
in the local meta-optimization. This enables the local meta-learner to optimize
quickly and efficiently without retaining the client's private data. Our
experiments demonstrate that FedMeNF achieves fast optimization speed and
robust reconstruction performance, even with few-shot or non-IID data across
diverse data modalities, while preserving client data privacy.

Conclusion: UPD为无监督协作学习提供了一种高效框架，显著提升了智能体的适应性和协作能力。

Abstract: We introduce Unsupervised Partner Design (UPD) - a population-free,
multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for robust ad-hoc teamwork that
adaptively generates training partners without requiring pretrained partners or
manual parameter tuning. UPD constructs diverse partners by stochastically
mixing an ego agent's policy with biased random behaviours and scores them
using a variance-based learnability metric that prioritises partners near the
ego agent's current learning frontier. We show that UPD can be integrated with
unsupervised environment design, resulting in the first method enabling fully
unsupervised curricula over both level and partner distributions in a
cooperative setting. Through extensive evaluations on Overcooked-AI and the
Overcooked Generalisation Challenge, we demonstrate that this dynamic partner
curriculum is highly effective: UPD consistently outperforms both
population-based and population-free baselines as well as ablations. In a user
study, we further show that UPD achieves higher returns than all baselines and
was perceived as significantly more adaptive, more human-like, a better
collaborator, and less frustrating.

TL;DR: FCL是一种自适应鲁棒损失函数，通过分数阶导数和MAE自动调整对标签噪声的鲁棒性，无需手动调参。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有鲁棒损失函数需要大量数据集特定的超参数调优，FCL旨在解决这一问题。

Method: FCL结合交叉熵的分数阶导数和MAE，动态学习分数阶导数阶数μ以平衡鲁棒性和收敛速度。

Result: FCL在基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，无需手动调参。

Conclusion: FCL通过动态调整损失函数形态，有效解决了标签噪声下的分类问题。

Abstract: Robust loss functions are crucial for training deep neural networks in the
presence of label noise, yet existing approaches require extensive,
dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning. In this work, we introduce Fractional
Classification Loss (FCL), an adaptive robust loss that automatically
calibrates its robustness to label noise during training. Built within the
active-passive loss framework, FCL employs the fractional derivative of the
Cross-Entropy (CE) loss as its active component and the Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) as its passive loss component. With this formulation, we demonstrate that
the fractional derivative order $\mu$ spans a family of loss functions that
interpolate between MAE-like robustness and CE-like fast convergence.
Furthermore, we integrate $\mu$ into the gradient-based optimization as a
learnable parameter and automatically adjust it to optimize the trade-off
between robustness and convergence speed. We reveal that FCL's unique property
establishes a critical trade-off that enables the stable learning of $\mu$:
lower log penalties on difficult or mislabeled examples improve robustness but
impose higher penalties on easy or clean data, reducing model confidence in
them. Consequently, FCL can dynamically reshape its loss landscape to achieve
effective classification performance under label noise. Extensive experiments
on benchmark datasets show that FCL achieves state-of-the-art results without
the need for manual hyperparameter tuning.

approach that significantly enhances the efficiency and energy economy of the
widely utilized k-means algorithm, which, despite its inception over five
decades ago, remains a cornerstone in machine learning applications. The
essence of Gk-means lies in its active utilization of geometric principles,
specifically scalar projection, to significantly accelerate the algorithm
without sacrificing solution quality. This geometric strategy enables a more
discerning focus on data points that are most likely to influence cluster
updates, which we call as high expressive data (HE). In contrast, low
expressive data (LE), does not impact clustering outcome, is effectively
bypassed, leading to considerable reductions in computational overhead.
Experiments spanning synthetic, real-world and high-dimensional datasets,
demonstrate Gk-means is significantly better than traditional and state of the
art (SOTA) k-means variants in runtime and distance computations (DC).
Moreover, Gk-means exhibits better resource efficiency, as evidenced by its
reduced energy footprint, placing it as more sustainable alternative.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在无明确诱导情况下的自我欺骗行为，并提出了一种基于心理学的量化框架，发现LLMs在处理复杂问题时欺骗倾向增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的信任度是关键问题，但现有研究多通过人为诱导欺骗，忽略了LLMs可能自发的欺骗行为。论文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出基于'接触搜索问题'的框架，引入两个统计指标（欺骗意图分数和欺骗行为分数）量化LLMs的欺骗倾向。

Result: 评估14个主流LLMs发现，随着任务难度增加，欺骗指标显著上升。

Conclusion: 即使最先进的LLMs在处理复杂问题时也会表现出欺骗倾向，这对LLMs在关键领域的部署提出了警示。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed in reasoning,
planning, and decision-making tasks, making their trustworthiness a critical
concern. The potential for intentional deception, where an LLM deliberately
fabricates or conceals information to serve a hidden objective, remains a
significant and underexplored threat. Existing studies typically induce such
deception by explicitly setting a "hidden" objective through prompting or
fine-tuning, which may not fully reflect real-world human-LLM interactions.
Moving beyond this human-induced deception, we investigate LLMs' self-initiated
deception on benign prompts. To address the absence of ground truth in this
evaluation, we propose a novel framework using "contact searching questions."
This framework introduces two statistical metrics derived from psychological
principles to quantify the likelihood of deception. The first, the Deceptive
Intention Score, measures the model's bias towards a hidden objective. The
second, Deceptive Behavior Score, measures the inconsistency between the LLM's
internal belief and its expressed output. Upon evaluating 14 leading LLMs, we
find that both metrics escalate as task difficulty increases, rising in
parallel for most models. Building on these findings, we formulate a
mathematical model to explain this behavior. These results reveal that even the
most advanced LLMs exhibit an increasing tendency toward deception when
handling complex problems, raising critical concerns for the deployment of LLM
agents in complex and crucial domains.

TL;DR: ActivityDiff是一种基于扩散模型的生成方法，通过分类器引导技术实现分子活性的精确控制，包括增强目标活性和减少副作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成方法主要关注单一活性分子，缺乏同时管理多目标和非目标相互作用的机制。

Method: 基于扩散模型，利用分别训练的药物-靶点分类器进行正负引导。

Result: 实验表明，ActivityDiff能有效处理单/双靶点生成、片段约束双靶点设计、选择性生成及减少副作用等任务。

Conclusion: ActivityDiff为分子设计提供了一种平衡功效和安全性的新范式，是一个多功能且可扩展的框架。

Abstract: Achieving precise control over a molecule's biological activity-encompassing
targeted activation/inhibition, cooperative multi-target modulation, and
off-target toxicity mitigation-remains a critical challenge in de novo drug
design. However, existing generative methods primarily focus on producing
molecules with a single desired activity, lacking integrated mechanisms for the
simultaneous management of multiple intended and unintended molecular
interactions. Here, we propose ActivityDiff, a generative approach based on the
classifier-guidance technique of diffusion models. It leverages separately
trained drug-target classifiers for both positive and negative guidance,
enabling the model to enhance desired activities while minimizing harmful
off-target effects. Experimental results show that ActivityDiff effectively
handles essential drug design tasks, including single-/dual-target generation,
fragment-constrained dual-target design, selective generation to enhance target
specificity, and reduction of off-target effects. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of classifier-guided diffusion in balancing efficacy and safety
in molecular design. Overall, our work introduces a novel paradigm for
achieving integrated control over molecular activity, and provides ActivityDiff
as a versatile and extensible framework.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种三阶段的端到端文本到SQL框架，通过LLM和提示工程提取自然语言查询中的隐含信息，预测目标数据库并生成SQL查询，显著提升了数据库意图预测和SQL生成准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文本到SQL方法假设目标数据库已知，但在多数据库场景中，识别正确数据库是关键但常被忽视的步骤。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用三阶段框架：1) 利用LLM和提示工程从NLQ中提取规则；2) 训练RoBERTa微调编码器预测db_id；3) 使用批评代理修正SQL错误。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在数据库意图预测和SQL生成准确性上优于当前最优模型。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了多数据库场景下的文本到SQL问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL bridges the gap between natural language and structured database
language, thus allowing non-technical users to easily query databases.
Traditional approaches model text-to-SQL as a direct translation task, where a
given Natural Language Query (NLQ) is mapped to an SQL command. Recent advances
in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved translation
accuracy, however, these methods all require that the target database is
pre-specified. This becomes problematic in scenarios with multiple extensive
databases, where identifying the correct database becomes a crucial yet
overlooked step. In this paper, we propose a three-stage end-to-end text-to-SQL
framework to identify the user's intended database before generating SQL
queries. Our approach leverages LLMs and prompt engineering to extract implicit
information from natural language queries (NLQs) in the form of a ruleset. We
then train a large db\_id prediction model, which includes a RoBERTa-based
finetuned encoder, to predict the correct Database identifier (db\_id) based on
both the NLQ and the LLM-generated rules. Finally, we refine the generated SQL
by using critic agents to correct errors. Experimental results demonstrate that
our framework outperforms the current state-of-the-art models in both database
intent prediction and SQL generation accuracy.

Result: 模型揭示了传统方法忽略的模式（如疫情期间的快速波动和帐篷位置的空间变化）。

Conclusion: 该方法为政策制定和干预评估提供了更有效的工具。

Abstract: Homelessness in the United States has surged to levels unseen since the Great
Depression. However, existing methods for monitoring it, such as point-in-time
(PIT) counts, have limitations in terms of frequency, consistency, and spatial
detail. This study proposes a new approach using publicly available,
crowdsourced data, specifically 311 Service Calls and street-level imagery, to
track and forecast homeless tent trends in San Francisco. Our predictive model
captures fine-grained daily and neighborhood-level variations, uncovering
patterns that traditional counts often overlook, such as rapid fluctuations
during the COVID-19 pandemic and spatial shifts in tent locations over time. By
providing more timely, localized, and cost-effective information, this approach
serves as a valuable tool for guiding policy responses and evaluating
interventions aimed at reducing unsheltered homelessness.

Result: 实验表明LoRR显著提升数学和通用推理任务性能，甚至优于复杂RL算法。

Conclusion: LoRR为LLM微调提供了高效、实用的解决方案，尤其适合数据有限场景。

Abstract: Recent advancements in post-training Large Language Models (LLMs),
particularly through Reinforcement Learning (RL) and preference optimization
methods, are key drivers for enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However,
these methods are often plagued by low sample efficiency and a susceptibility
to primacy bias, where overfitting to initial experiences degrades policy
quality and damages the learning process. To address these challenges, we
introduce LLM optimization with Reset Replay (LoRR), a general and powerful
plugin designed to enhance sample efficiency in any preference-based
optimization framework. LoRR core mechanism enables training at a high replay
number, maximizing the utility of each collected data batch. To counteract the
risk of overfitting inherent in high-replay training, LoRR incorporates a
periodic reset strategy with reusing initial data, which preserves network
plasticity. Furthermore, it leverages a hybrid optimization objective,
combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference-based losses to further
bolster data exploitation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LoRR
significantly boosts the performance of various preference optimization methods
on both mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks. Notably, an iterative
DPO approach augmented with LoRR achieves comparable performance on challenging
math tasks, outperforming some complex and computationally intensive RL-based
algorithms. These findings highlight that LoRR offers a practical,
sample-efficient, and highly effective paradigm for LLM finetuning, unlocking
greater performance from limited data.

Method: GRIN提出梯度比指标定位关键参数，选择性注入噪声后进行微调。

Result: 在TOFU、WMDP和SafePKU等基准测试中验证了GRIN的有效性。

Conclusion: GRIN为LLM提供了一种高效且针对性的遗忘方法，平衡了遗忘效果与模型性能。

Abstract: The growing legal and ethical scrutiny of large language models (LLMs)
necessitates effective machine unlearning, particularly for sensitive or
unauthorized data. Existing empirical methods often yield incomplete forgetting
or unintended degradation of unrelated knowledge due to poor localization. In
this work, we propose GRIN: a modular and targeted framework for LLM
unlearning. GRIN introduces a novel gradient-ratio-based metric to identify
parameters most responsible for memorizing forget data. We then perform
selective noise injection into these parameters prior to fine-tuning, which
improves unlearning performance while maintaining model utility. Finally, we
propose new evaluation metrics tailored to the LLM setting and validate our
approach on standard benchmarks such as TOFU, WMDP, and SafePKU.

Motivation: 研究动机来源于众包和自动竞价应用，需要将固定预算分配到多个任务或拍卖中。

Method: 定义了一个基于概率单纯形的随机老虎机模型，设计了一种算法，其遗憾界为$K\sqrt{T}$（对数因子内）。

Result: 算法在$T$步后的期望遗憾为$K\sqrt{T}$，并在满足额外递减回报条件下改进为$K(\log T)^2$。

Conclusion: 论文为预算分配问题提供了理论保证，并在特定条件下进一步优化了遗憾界。

Abstract: Motivated by applications in crowdsourcing, where a fixed sum of money is
split among $K$ workers, and autobidding, where a fixed budget is used to bid
in $K$ simultaneous auctions, we define a stochastic bandit model where arms
belong to the $K$-dimensional probability simplex and represent the fraction of
budget allocated to each task/auction. The reward in each round is the sum of
$K$ stochastic rewards, where each of these rewards is unlocked with a
probability that varies with the fraction of the budget allocated to that
task/auction. We design an algorithm whose expected regret after $T$ steps is
of order $K\sqrt{T}$ (up to log factors) and prove a matching lower bound.
Improved bounds of order $K (\log T)^2$ are shown when the function mapping
budget to probability of unlocking the reward (i.e., terminating the task or
winning the auction) satisfies additional diminishing-returns conditions.

Conclusion: 多联盟协作模式结合MEC技术，能显著提升区块链网络的效率、安全性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a promising technology that enhances the
efficiency of mobile blockchain networks, by enabling miners, often acted by
mobile users (MUs) with limited computing resources, to offload
resource-intensive mining tasks to nearby edge computing servers. Collaborative
block mining can further boost mining efficiency by allowing multiple miners to
form coalitions, pooling their computing resources and transaction data
together to mine new blocks collaboratively. Therefore, an MEC-assisted
collaborative blockchain network can leverage the strengths of both
technologies, offering improved efficiency, security, and scalability for
blockchain systems. While existing research in this area has mainly focused on
the single-coalition collaboration mode, where each miner can only join one
coalition, this work explores a more comprehensive multi-coalition
collaboration mode, which allows each miner to join multiple coalitions. To
analyze the behavior of miners and the edge computing service provider (ECP) in
this scenario, we propose a novel two-stage Stackelberg game. In Stage I, the
ECP, as the leader, determines the prices of computing resources for all MUs.
In Stage II, each MU decides the coalitions to join, resulting in an
overlapping coalition formation (OCF) game; Subsequently, each coalition
decides how many edge computing resources to purchase from the ECP, leading to
an edge resource competition (ERC) game. We derive the closed-form Nash
equilibrium for the ERC game, based on which we further propose an OCF-based
alternating algorithm to achieve a stable coalition structure for the OCF game
and develop a near-optimal pricing strategy for the ECP's resource pricing
problem.

Conclusion: 论文为可再生能源网络中的激励机制研究开辟了新方向，呼吁未来在算法博弈论领域深入探索。

Abstract: The recent rise of renewable energy produced by many decentralized sources
yields interesting market design challenges for electrical grids. Balancing
supply and demand in such networks is both a temporal and spatial challenge due
to capacity constraints. The recent surge in the number of household-owned
batteries, especially in regions with rooftop solar adoption, offers mitigation
potential but often acts misaligned with grid-level objectives. In fact, the
decision to charge or discharge a household-owned battery is a strategic choice
by each battery owner governed by selfish incentives. This calls for an
analysis from a game-theoretic point of view.
  We initiate this timely research direction by considering a game-theoretic
setting where selfish agents strategically charge or discharge their batteries
to increase their profit. In particular, we study a Stackelberg-like market
model where a third party introduces price incentives, aiming to optimize
renewable energy utilization while preserving grid feasibility. For this, we
study the existence and the quality of equilibria under various pricing
strategies. We find that the existence of equilibria crucially depends on the
chosen pricing and that the obtained social welfare varies widely. This calls
for more sophisticated market models and pricing mechanisms and opens up a rich
field for future research in Algorithmic Game Theory on incentives in renewable
energy networks.

Conclusion: 该框架结合MCDM、实证数据和AI辅助意图建模，提供了一种可扩展、可解释且可重复的软件包选择方法。

Abstract: Selecting third-party software packages in open-source ecosystems like Python
is challenging due to the large number of alternatives and limited transparent
evidence for comparison. Generative AI tools are increasingly used in
development workflows, but their suggestions often overlook dependency
evaluation, emphasize popularity over suitability, and lack reproducibility.
This creates risks for projects that require transparency, long-term
reliability, maintainability, and informed architectural decisions. This study
formulates software package selection as a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making
(MCDM) problem and proposes a data-driven framework for technology evaluation.
Automated data pipelines continuously collect and integrate software metadata,
usage trends, vulnerability information, and developer sentiment from GitHub,
PyPI, and Stack Overflow. These data are structured into a decision model
representing relationships among packages, domain features, and quality
attributes. The framework is implemented in PySelect, a decision support system
that uses large language models to interpret user intent and query the model to
identify contextually appropriate packages. The approach is evaluated using
798,669 Python scripts from 16,887 GitHub repositories and a user study based
on the Technology Acceptance Model. Results show high data extraction
precision, improved recommendation quality over generative AI baselines, and
positive user evaluations of usefulness and ease of use. This work introduces a
scalable, interpretable, and reproducible framework that supports
evidence-based software selection using MCDM principles, empirical data, and
AI-assisted intent modeling.

Motivation: 学生在有限时间内完成Laravel项目存在困难，需通过工具提升效率，同时确保代码质量和概念理解。

Method: 介绍Composer及其精选包，提供实践和教学建议，包括如何避免包冲突和过度依赖工具。

Result: Composer包能加速开发并增强专业实践，但需结合教学指导以避免学生将其视为黑箱。

Conclusion: 有效整合Composer需明确教学设计，确保工具使用支持深度学习，而非替代概念掌握。

Abstract: Laravel has emerged as a foundational framework in university web development
curricula. However, despite its scaffolding capabilities, students often
struggle to complete projects within limited academic timelines. This
conceptual paper introduces Composer, PHP's standard dependency manager, and
categorizes a curated selection of Composer packages that significantly reduce
development effort while fostering professional software practices. Grounded in
practical and pedagogical considerations, the paper illustrates how educators
and learners can strategically leverage these tools to build typical academic
or personal Laravel-based systems. Central to this approach is maintaining code
quality and reinforcing conceptual understanding. The paper also addresses
potential risks such as package conflicts and over-reliance on tools, providing
best-practice recommendations to mitigate them. While the goal is to accelerate
development, the deeper objective is to reinforce professional workflows and
industry readiness. Exposure to Composer packages enhances curriculum relevance
and smooths the transition from academia to the workplace. However, effective
integration requires deliberate instructional design aligned with learning
objectives. Without guidance, students may treat packages as black boxes. Thus,
educators must teach not only how to use these tools, but also when and why,
encouraging critical evaluation of their utility and limitations. This ensures
that practical convenience supports rather than supplants deep learning.

Abstract: Understanding large-scale, complex software systems is a major challenge for
developers, who spend a significant portion of their time on program
comprehension. Traditional tools such as static visualizations and reverse
engineering techniques provide structural insights but often lack
interactivity, adaptability, and integration with contextual information.
Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to
enhance code exploration workflows, yet their lack of grounding and integration
with structured views limits their effectiveness. This work introduces a hybrid
approach that integrates deterministic reverse engineering with LLM-guided,
intent-aware visual exploration. The proposed system combines UML-based
visualization, dynamic user interfaces, historical context, and collaborative
features into an adaptive tool for code comprehension. By interpreting user
queries and interaction patterns, the LLM helps developers navigate and
understand complex codebases more effectively. A prototype implementation for
Java demonstrates the feasibility of this approach. Future work includes
empirical evaluation, scaling to polyglot systems, and exploring GUI-driven LLM
interaction models. This research lays the groundwork for intelligent,
interactive environments that align with developer cognition and collaborative
workflows.

Motivation: 软件漏洞威胁现代系统的安全性和可靠性，传统检测方法难以应对日益复杂的软件。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效检测更深层次和更复杂的漏洞，为软件安全测试提供了可扩展且自适应的解决方案。

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities continue to undermine the reliability and security
of modern systems, particularly as software complexity outpaces the
capabilities of traditional detection methods. This study introduces a genetic
algorithm-based method for test input generation that innovatively integrates
genetic operators and adaptive learning to enhance software vulnerability
detection. A key contribution is the application of the crossover operator,
which facilitates exploration by searching across a broader space of potential
test inputs. Complementing this, an adaptive feedback mechanism continuously
learns from the system's execution behavior and dynamically guides input
generation toward promising areas of the input space. Rather than relying on
fixed or randomly selected inputs, the approach evolves a population of
structurally valid test cases using feedback-driven selection, enabling deeper
and more effective code traversal. This strategic integration of exploration
and exploitation ensures that both diverse and targeted test inputs are
developed over time. Evaluation was conducted across nine open-source
JSON-processing libraries. The proposed method achieved substantial
improvements in coverage compared to a benchmark evolutionary fuzzing method,
with average gains of 39.8% in class coverage, 62.4% in method coverage, 105.0%
in line coverage, 114.0% in instruction coverage, and 166.0% in branch
coverage. These results highlight the method's capacity to detect deeper and
more complex vulnerabilities, offering a scalable and adaptive solution to
software security testing.

Abstract: The soaring energy demands of large-scale software ecosystems and cloud data
centers, accelerated by the intensive training and deployment of large language
models, have driven energy consumption and carbon footprint to unprecedented
levels. In response, both industry and academia are increasing efforts to
reduce the carbon emissions associated with cloud computing through more
efficient task scheduling and infrastructure orchestration. In this work, we
present a systematic review of various Kubernetes scheduling strategies,
categorizing them into hardware-centric and software-centric, annotating each
with its sustainability objectives, and grouping them according to the
algorithms they use. We propose a comprehensive taxonomy for cloud task
scheduling studies, with a particular focus on the environmental sustainability
aspect. We analyze emerging research trends and open challenges, and our
findings provide critical insight into the design of sustainable scheduling
solutions for next-generation cloud computing systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于检索增强生成（RAG）的代码补全方法，通过评估检索代码块对补全的影响，构建了带标签的数据集，并提出了自适应过滤框架CODEFILTER，显著提升了补全准确性和效率。

Motivation: 研究检索到的跨文件上下文对代码补全的贡献，发现部分检索内容反而降低性能，需解决这一问题。

Method: 引入基于似然的评估指标，构建带标签的数据集，提出自适应过滤框架CODEFILTER。

Result: CODEFILTER在多个基准测试中提升了补全准确性，减少了输入提示长度，提高了计算效率。

Conclusion: CODEFILTER能有效提升代码补全的准确性、效率和可归因性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has recently demonstrated considerable
potential for repository-level code completion, as it integrates cross-file
knowledge with in-file preceding code to provide comprehensive contexts for
generation. To better understand the contribution of the retrieved cross-file
contexts, we introduce a likelihood-based metric to evaluate the impact of each
retrieved code chunk on the completion. Our analysis reveals that, despite
retrieving numerous chunks, only a small subset positively contributes to the
completion, while some chunks even degrade performance. To address this issue,
we leverage this metric to construct a repository-level dataset where each
retrieved chunk is labeled as positive, neutral, or negative based on its
relevance to the target completion. We then propose an adaptive retrieval
context filtering framework, CODEFILTER, trained on this dataset to mitigate
the harmful effects of negative retrieved contexts in code completion.
Extensive evaluation on the RepoEval and CrossCodeLongEval benchmarks
demonstrates that CODEFILTER consistently improves completion accuracy compared
to approaches without filtering operations across various tasks. Additionally,
CODEFILTER significantly reduces the length of the input prompt, enhancing
computational efficiency while exhibiting strong generalizability across
different models. These results underscore the potential of CODEFILTER to
enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and attributability of repository-level code
completion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI驱动的编码系统决策不透明，导致非专家用户对其信任和可用性存疑，需通过解释提升理解。

Method: 提出神经符号方法，结合符号约束和神经表示，生成认知对齐和语义忠实的解释。

Result: 现有方法（如形式验证、静态分析）在生成解释方面存在局限性，神经符号方法更具潜力。

Conclusion: 神经符号方法能有效生成代码解释，提升用户对AI编码系统的信任和理解。

Abstract: Intelligent coding systems are transforming software development by enabling
users to specify code behavior in natural language. However, the opaque
decision-making of AI-driven coders raises trust and usability concerns,
particularly for non-expert users who cannot inspect low-level implementations.
We argue that these systems should not only generate code but also produce
clear, consistent justifications that bridge model reasoning and user
understanding. To this end, we identify two critical justification
properties-cognitive alignment and semantic faithfulness-and highlight the
limitations of existing methods, including formal verification, static
analysis, and post-hoc explainability. We advocate exploring neuro-symbolic
approaches for justification generation, where symbolic constraints guide model
behavior during training and program semantics are enriched through neural
representations, enabling automated consistency checks at inference time.

Conclusion: 研究结果对避免智能合约中的不一致状态更新漏洞具有重要价值，为开发者、工具构建者和语言设计者提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Smart contracts enable contract terms to be automatically executed and
verified on the blockchain, and recent years have witnessed numerous
applications of them in areas such as financial institutions and supply chains.
The execution logic of a smart contract is closely related to the contract
state, and thus the correct and safe execution of the contract depends heavily
on the precise control and update of the contract state. However, the contract
state update process can have issues. In particular, inconsistent state update
issues can arise for reasons such as unsynchronized modifications. Inconsistent
state update bugs have been exploited by attackers many times, but existing
detection tools still have difficulty in effectively identifying them. This
paper conducts the first large-scale empirical study about inconsistent state
update vulnerabilities (that is, inconsistent state update bugs that are
exploitable) in smart contracts, aiming to shed light for developers,
researchers, tool builders, and language or library designers in order to avoid
inconsistent state update vulnerabilities. We systematically investigate 116
inconsistent state update vulnerabilities in 352 real-world smart contract
projects, summarizing their root causes, fix strategies, and exploitation
methods. Our study provides 11 original and important findings, and we also
give the implications of our findings. To illustrate the potential benefits of
our research, we also develop a proof-of-concept checker based on one of our
findings. The checker effectively detects issues in 64 popular GitHub projects,
and 19 project owners have confirmed the detected issues at the time of
writing. The result demonstrates the usefulness and importance of our findings
for avoiding inconsistent state update vulnerabilities in smart contracts.

TL;DR: 研究通过改进OutSystems平台的BPT DSL，显著提升了其语义透明度和用户体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BPT DSL的采用率低且存在可用性问题，增加了维护成本，因此需要改进。

Method: 结合访谈、"Physics of Notation"批判性审查、SUS和NASA TLX实证评估，开发新版本BPT。

Result: 新版本BPT的语义透明度从31%提升至69%，正确率从51%升至89%，SUS分数从42.25升至64.78，TLX分数从36.50降至20.78。

Conclusion: 新版本BPT显著改善了开发者体验，用户背景对最终语法选择和可用性指标有重要影响。

Abstract: Context: The OutSystems Platform is a development environment composed of
several DSLs, used to specify, quickly build, and validate web and mobile
applications. The DSLs allow users to model different perspectives such as
interfaces and data models, define custom business logic and construct process
models. Problem: The DSL for process modelling (Business Process Technology
(BPT)), has a low adoption rate and is perceived as having usability problems
hampering its adoption. This is problematic given the language maintenance
costs. Method: We used a combination of interviews, a critical review of BPT
using the "Physics of Notation" and empirical evaluations of BPT using the
System Usability Scale (SUS) and the NASA Task Load indeX (TLX), to develop a
new version of BPT, taking these inputs and Outsystems' engineers' culture into
account. Results: Evaluations conducted with 25 professional software engineers
showed an increase of the semantic transparency on the new version, from 31% to
69%, an increase in the correctness of responses, from 51% to 89%, an increase
in the SUS score, from 42.25 to 64.78, and a decrease of the TLX score, from
36.50 to 20.78. These differences were statistically significant. Conclusions:
These results suggest that the new version of BPT significantly improved the
developer experience of the previous version. The end users' background with
OutSystems had a relevant impact on the final concrete syntax choices and
achieved usability indicators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数软件问题缺乏复现测试，而传统方法因代码缺失或错误难以生成有效测试。

Method: 引入新技术利用执行反馈绕过代码问题，开发了测试生成工具e-Otter++。

Result: 在TDD-Bench Verified基准测试中，e-Otter++的平均失败转通过率达到63%。

Conclusion: e-Otter++在自动生成复现测试方面取得了显著进展，为软件工程问题提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: A software engineering issue (SWE issue) is easier to resolve when
accompanied by a reproduction test. Unfortunately, most issues do not come with
functioning reproduction tests, so this paper explores how to generate them
automatically. The primary challenge in this setting is that the code to be
tested is either missing or wrong, as evidenced by the existence of the issue
in the first place. This has held back test generation for this setting:
without the correct code to execute, it is difficult to leverage execution
feedback to generate good tests. This paper introduces novel techniques for
leveraging execution feedback to get around this problem, implemented in a new
reproduction test generator called e-Otter++. Experiments show that e-Otter++
represents a leap ahead in the state-of-the-art for this problem, generating
tests with an average fail-to-pass rate of 63% on the TDD-Bench Verified
benchmark.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文研究了代码示例中不同特征对上下文学习（ICL）在代码生成中的影响，发现变量和函数命名是关键因素，而当前LLMs在从类似代码中提取通用问题解决洞察方面存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于代码示例的ICL方法在提升大语言模型（LLMs）的代码生成能力方面表现出色，但具体哪些代码特征（如命名风格、格式等）对其有效性起关键作用尚不明确。

Method: 通过控制性消融实验，系统研究了代码示例中不同特征对ICL效果的影响。

Result: 研究发现，变量和函数的适当命名对代码生成至关重要，其缺失可能导致性能下降30%；LLMs更注重语义上有意义的命名而非格式，且对标识符冗长度有语言偏好。此外，LLMs难以从类似代码中提取通用问题解决洞察。

Conclusion: 这些发现为优化代码生成中的ICL系统提供了重要见解，并揭示了基于反思学习的代码生成任务中的基本挑战。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as a promising solution to enhance the
code generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), which
incorporates code examples inside the prompt to let LLMs learn from
demonstrations. However, despite the substantial effectiveness of the code
example-based ICL approach, the specific features (e.g., identifier naming
styles, code formatting, solution insight) within the ICL-provided code
examples that significantly contribute to the ICL's effectiveness remain
unclear. This paper systematically investigates the impact of various code
features on ICL with code examples through controlled ablation studies. Our
findings reveal that the appropriate naming of variables and functions is
crucial for effective code generation, with their elimination leading to
performance decreases of up to 30 percentage points. We further demonstrate
that LLMs prioritize semantically meaningful identifier names over formatting
conventions, with language-specific preferences regarding identifier verbosity.
Additionally, our investigation into ICL's potential for enhancing reflection
and inference capabilities reveals that current LLMs struggle to extract
generalizable problem-solving insights from similar code solutions, despite
being capable of utilizing direct information effectively. These findings are
expected to provide valuable insights for optimizing ICL systems in code
generation applications and highlight fundamental challenges in
reflection-based learning for code generation tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自适应探索策略优化（AEPO）框架，解决了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在GUI操作中语义对齐的探索效率问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI操作中，自然语言指令的语义对齐是一个关键挑战，现有方法在探索效率上存在瓶颈。

Method: 提出了AEPO框架，采用多答案生成策略和自适应探索奖励函数（AER）来优化探索效率。

Result: AEPO训练的模型在多个GUI基准测试中取得了新的最优结果，性能提升高达9.0%。

Conclusion: AEPO有效解决了语义对齐的探索问题，为GUI操作的自动化提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has propelled the
development of autonomous agents that operate on Graphical User Interfaces
(GUIs) using pure visual input. A fundamental challenge is robustly grounding
natural language instructions. This requires a precise spatial alignment, which
accurately locates the coordinates of each element, and, more critically, a
correct semantic alignment, which matches the instructions to the functionally
appropriate UI element. Although Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) has proven to be effective at improving spatial alignment for these
MLLMs, we find that inefficient exploration bottlenecks semantic alignment,
which prevent models from learning difficult semantic associations. To address
this exploration problem, we present Adaptive Exploration Policy Optimization
(AEPO), a new policy optimization framework. AEPO employs a multi-answer
generation strategy to enforce broader exploration, which is then guided by a
theoretically grounded Adaptive Exploration Reward (AER) function derived from
first principles of efficiency eta=U/C. Our AEPO-trained models, InfiGUI-G1-3B
and InfiGUI-G1-7B, establish new state-of-the-art results across multiple
challenging GUI grounding benchmarks, achieving significant relative
improvements of up to 9.0% against the naive RLVR baseline on benchmarks
designed to test generalization and semantic understanding. Resources are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI安全方法（如事后可解释性和奖励工程）存在根本性局限，需将安全性融入系统核心设计。

Method: 采用多智能体系统，基于主动推理原则自组织，通过自然语言表示信念和偏好，并引入层次化马尔可夫毯实现安全约束。

Result: 提出具体安全机制，包括信念与偏好的自然语言分离、资源感知的自由能最小化以及模块化智能体结构。

Conclusion: 该框架为AGI开发提供了一条更安全的新路径，未来将在ARC基准上进行实验验证。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for developing safe Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI) by combining Active Inference principles with Large Language
Models (LLMs). We argue that traditional approaches to AI safety, focused on
post-hoc interpretability and reward engineering, have fundamental limitations.
We present an architecture where safety guarantees are integrated into the
system's core design through transparent belief representations and
hierarchical value alignment. Our framework leverages natural language as a
medium for representing and manipulating beliefs, enabling direct human
oversight while maintaining computational tractability. The architecture
implements a multi-agent system where agents self-organize according to Active
Inference principles, with preferences and safety constraints flowing through
hierarchical Markov blankets. We outline specific mechanisms for ensuring
safety, including: (1) explicit separation of beliefs and preferences in
natural language, (2) bounded rationality through resource-aware free energy
minimization, and (3) compositional safety through modular agent structures.
The paper concludes with a research agenda centered on the Abstraction and
Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark, proposing experiments to validate our
framework's safety properties. Our approach offers a path toward AGI
development that is inherently safer, rather than retrofitted with safety
measures.

Result: 神经网络展现出类似符号系统的能力，表明人类认知可能不完全依赖符号系统。

Conclusion: 提出新的研究议程，探索人类思维的符号基础。

Abstract: Some of the strongest evidence that human minds should be thought about in
terms of symbolic systems has been the way they combine ideas, produce novelty,
and learn quickly. We argue that modern neural networks -- and the artificial
intelligence systems built upon them -- exhibit similar abilities. This
undermines the argument that the cognitive processes and representations used
by human minds are symbolic, although the fact that these neural networks are
typically trained on data generated by symbolic systems illustrates that such
systems play an important role in characterizing the abstract problems that
human minds have to solve. This argument leads us to offer a new agenda for
research on the symbolic basis of human thought.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有XAI方法主要服务于开发者，且多关注模型输出的合理性，而非多样化的利益相关者需求。

Method: H-XAI整合因果评级与传统XAI方法，支持利益相关者通过提问、假设测试及与自动构建的随机和偏置基线对比来理解模型行为。

Result: 通过两个案例研究（信用风险分类和金融时间序列预测）验证了H-XAI的通用性，填补了现有XAI方法的空白。

Conclusion: H-XAI通过结合因果评级和后验解释，为利益相关者提供个体决策和整体模型层面的解答，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Current eXplainable AI (XAI) methods largely serve developers, often focusing
on justifying model outputs rather than supporting diverse stakeholder needs. A
recent shift toward Evaluative AI reframes explanation as a tool for hypothesis
testing, but still focuses primarily on operational organizations. We introduce
Holistic-XAI (H-XAI), a unified framework that integrates causal rating methods
with traditional XAI methods to support explanation as an interactive,
multi-method process. H-XAI allows stakeholders to ask a series of questions,
test hypotheses, and compare model behavior against automatically constructed
random and biased baselines. It combines instance-level and global
explanations, adapting to each stakeholder's goals, whether understanding
individual decisions, assessing group-level bias, or evaluating robustness
under perturbations. We demonstrate the generality of our approach through two
case studies spanning six scenarios: binary credit risk classification and
financial time-series forecasting. H-XAI fills critical gaps left by existing
XAI methods by combining causal ratings and post-hoc explanations to answer
stakeholder-specific questions at both the individual decision level and the
overall model level.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平机器学习（Fair ML）的偏差定义多为观察性，且在实际应用中存在冲突和局限性，无法适应动态社会环境。

Method: 提出“Fair Game”框架，将审计员和去偏算法通过强化学习循环结合，动态调整公平目标。

Result: “Fair Game”提供了一个灵活且随时间适应的框架，可在部署前后构建公平的ML系统。

Conclusion: 该框架通过模拟社会伦理和法律框架的演变，为公平机器学习提供了动态解决方案。

Abstract: An emerging field of AI, namely Fair Machine Learning (ML), aims to quantify
different types of bias (also known as unfairness) exhibited in the predictions
of ML algorithms, and to design new algorithms to mitigate them. Often, the
definitions of bias used in the literature are observational, i.e. they use the
input and output of a pre-trained algorithm to quantify a bias under concern.
In reality,these definitions are often conflicting in nature and can only be
deployed if either the ground truth is known or only in retrospect after
deploying the algorithm. Thus,there is a gap between what we want Fair ML to
achieve and what it does in a dynamic social environment. Hence, we propose an
alternative dynamic mechanism,"Fair Game",to assure fairness in the predictions
of an ML algorithm and to adapt its predictions as the society interacts with
the algorithm over time. "Fair Game" puts together an Auditor and a Debiasing
algorithm in a loop around an ML algorithm. The "Fair Game" puts these two
components in a loop by leveraging Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL algorithms
interact with an environment to take decisions, which yields new observations
(also known as data/feedback) from the environment and in turn, adapts future
decisions. RL is already used in algorithms with pre-fixed long-term fairness
goals. "Fair Game" provides a unique framework where the fairness goals can be
adapted over time by only modifying the auditor and the different biases it
quantifies. Thus,"Fair Game" aims to simulate the evolution of ethical and
legal frameworks in the society by creating an auditor which sends feedback to
a debiasing algorithm deployed around an ML system. This allows us to develop a
flexible and adaptive-over-time framework to build Fair ML systems pre- and
post-deployment.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance and gain influence, the
development of embodied AI has accelerated, drawing significant attention,
particularly in navigation scenarios. Embodied navigation requires an agent to
perceive, interact with, and adapt to its environment while moving toward a
specified target in unfamiliar settings. However, the integration of embodied
navigation into critical applications raises substantial safety concerns. Given
their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments, ensuring the safety of
such systems is critical. This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of
safety in embodied navigation from multiple perspectives, encompassing attack
strategies, defense mechanisms, and evaluation methodologies. Beyond conducting
a comprehensive examination of existing safety challenges, mitigation
technologies, and various datasets and metrics that assess effectiveness and
robustness, we explore unresolved issues and future research directions in
embodied navigation safety. These include potential attack methods, mitigation
strategies, more reliable evaluation techniques, and the implementation of
verification frameworks. By addressing these critical gaps, this survey aims to
provide valuable insights that can guide future research toward the development
of safer and more reliable embodied navigation systems. Furthermore, the
findings of this study have broader implications for enhancing societal safety
and increasing industrial efficiency.

Result: 神经网络作为投票规则在减少公理违反方面优于传统规则。

Conclusion: 数据驱动方法可为新投票系统设计提供参考，并推动社会选择领域的进一步研究。

Abstract: Committee-selection problems arise in many contexts and applications, and
there has been increasing interest within the social choice research community
on identifying which properties are satisfied by different multi-winner voting
rules. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework to evaluate how
frequently voting rules violate axioms across diverse preference distributions
in practice, shifting away from the binary perspective of axiom satisfaction
given by worst-case analysis. Using this framework, we analyze the relationship
between multi-winner voting rules and their axiomatic performance under several
preference distributions. We then show that neural networks, acting as voting
rules, can outperform traditional rules in minimizing axiom violations. Our
results suggest that data-driven approaches to social choice can inform the
design of new voting systems and support the continuation of data-driven
research in social choice.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于知识图谱（KG）的工具检索框架，用于解决多步骤用户请求中的工具检索问题，相比传统方法显著提高了检索准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工具检索方法主要依赖用户查询与工具描述的相似性，难以处理多步骤请求，因此需要一种更全面的方法。

Method: 采用知识图谱建模工具间的语义关系和功能依赖，利用1-hop ego工具图的集成算法进行检索。

Result: 在实验中，该方法在Complete Recall指标上达到91.85%的工具覆盖率，优于非KG基线方法的89.26%。

Conclusion: 知识图谱的结构信息为工具检索提供了补充信号，特别适用于需要顺序工具组合的查询。

Abstract: Effective tool retrieval is essential for AI agents to select from a vast
array of tools when identifying and planning actions in the context of complex
user queries. Despite its central role in planning, this aspect remains
underexplored in the literature. Traditional approaches rely primarily on
similarities between user queries and tool descriptions, which significantly
limits retrieval accuracy, specifically when handling multi-step user requests.
To address these limitations, we propose a Knowledge Graph (KG)-based tool
retrieval framework that captures the semantic relationships between tools and
their functional dependencies. Our retrieval algorithm leverages ensembles of
1-hop ego tool graphs to model direct and indirect connections between tools,
enabling more comprehensive and contextual tool selection for multi-step tasks.
We evaluate our approach on a synthetically generated internal dataset across
six defined user classes, extending previous work on coherent dialogue
synthesis and too retrieval benchmarks. Results demonstrate that our tool
graph-based method achieves 91.85% tool coverage on the micro-average Complete
Recall metric, compared to 89.26% for re-ranked semantic-lexical hybrid
retrieval, the strongest non-KG baseline in our experiments. These findings
support our hypothesis that the structural information in the KG provides
complementary signals to pure similarity matching, particularly for queries

Abstract: Complex medical decision-making involves cooperative workflows operated by
different clinicians. Designing AI multi-agent systems can expedite and augment
human-level clinical decision-making. Existing multi-agent researches primarily
focus on language-only tasks, yet their extension to multimodal scenarios
remains challenging. A blind combination of diverse vision-language models
(VLMs) can amplify an erroneous outcome interpretation. VLMs in general are
less capable in instruction following and importantly self-reflection, compared
to large language models (LLMs) of comparable sizes. This disparity largely
constrains VLMs' ability in cooperative workflows. In this study, we propose
MedOrch, a mediator-guided multi-agent collaboration framework for medical
multimodal decision-making. MedOrch employs an LLM-based mediator agent that
enables multiple VLM-based expert agents to exchange and reflect on their
outputs towards collaboration. We utilize multiple open-source general-purpose
and domain-specific VLMs instead of costly GPT-series models, revealing the
strength of heterogeneous models. We show that the collaboration within
distinct VLM-based agents can surpass the capabilities of any individual agent.
We validate our approach on five medical vision question answering benchmarks,
demonstrating superior collaboration performance without model training. Our
findings underscore the value of mediator-guided multi-agent collaboration in
advancing medical multimodal intelligence. Our code will be made publicly
available.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为HIMA的分层多智能体框架，通过模仿学习和元控制器（Strategic Planner）解决大型语言模型在动态、长期任务（如《星际争霸II》）中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的方法在动态、长期任务（如《星际争霸II》）中表现不佳，难以应对资源管理和部分可观测环境的挑战。

Method: 采用分层多智能体框架（HIMA），结合模仿学习专家代理和元控制器（SP），生成结构化多步动作序列。

Result: HIMA在战略清晰性、适应性和计算效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 结合专业化模仿模块和元级协调，可开发更鲁棒、通用的AI智能体。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive action
sequence prediction capabilities but often struggle with dynamic, long-horizon
tasks such as real-time strategic games. In a game such as StarCraftII (SC2),
agents need to manage resource constraints and adapt to evolving battlefield
situations in a partially observable environment. This often overwhelms
exisiting LLM-based approaches. To address these challenges, we propose a
hierarchical multi-agent framework that employs specialized imitation learning
agents under a meta-controller called Strategic Planner (SP). By expert
demonstrations, each specialized agent learns a distinctive strategy, such as
aerial support or defensive maneuvers, and produces coherent, structured
multistep action sequences. The SP then orchestrates these proposals into a
single, environmentally adaptive plan that ensures local decisions aligning
with long-term strategies. We call this HIMA (Hierarchical Imitation
Multi-Agent). We also present TEXTSCII-ALL, a comprehensive SC2 testbed that
encompasses all race match combinations in SC2. Our empirical results show that
HIMA outperforms state of the arts in strategic clarity, adaptability, and
computational efficiency, underscoring the potential of combining specialized
imitation modules with meta-level orchestration to develop more robust,
general-purpose AI agents.

*Sankarshan Damle,Boi Faltings*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个双用途框架，利用参与式预算（PB）评估大型语言模型（LLM）在资源分配和推理能力方面的表现，并测试其从自然语言输入中推断偏好的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在复杂决策任务中的应用日益广泛，但其在结构化资源分配中的能力尚未充分探索，且现有评估方法存在数据污染和静态基准的问题。

Method: 通过三种提示策略（贪婪选择、直接优化和启发式改进）让LLMs在预算约束下选择项目子集，并与效用最大化基准对比。同时测试LLMs从自然语言输入推断偏好的能力。

Result: 结果表明提示设计对LLMs表现至关重要，并展示了LLMs在机制设计中处理非结构化输入的潜力。

Conclusion: LLMs在资源分配和偏好推断方面具有潜力，提示设计是关键因素。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to handle complex
decision-making tasks, yet their ability to perform structured resource
allocation remains underexplored. Evaluating their reasoning is also difficult
due to data contamination and the static nature of existing benchmarks. We
present a dual-purpose framework leveraging Participatory Budgeting (PB) both
as (i) a practical setting for LLM-based resource allocation and (ii) an
adaptive benchmark for evaluating their reasoning capabilities. We task LLMs
with selecting project subsets under feasibility (e.g., budget) constraints via
three prompting strategies: greedy selection, direct optimization, and a
hill-climbing-inspired refinement. We benchmark LLMs' allocations against a
utility-maximizing oracle. Interestingly, we also test whether LLMs can infer
structured preferences from natural-language voter input or metadata, without
explicit votes. By comparing allocations based on inferred preferences to those
from ground-truth votes, we evaluate LLMs' ability to extract preferences from
open-ended input. Our results underscore the role of prompt design and show
that LLMs hold promise for mechanism design with unstructured inputs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文呼吁重视认知想象力在人工智能中的作用，并提出语义模型作为模拟认知想象力的工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 认知想象力在人类思维中起关键作用，但当前AI领域对其重视不足，导致能力受限。

Method: 提出语义模型，一种基于概率因果关系的数学模型，能够学习和确保想象语境的连贯性。

Result: 语义模型能够模拟认知想象力，支持连贯的想象语境和透明操作。

Conclusion: 认知想象力是AI领域的潜在突破点，语义模型为实现这一目标提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Cognitive imagination is a type of imagination that plays a key role in human
thinking. It is not a ``picture-in-the-head'' imagination. It is a faculty to
mentally visualize coherent and holistic systems of concepts and causal links
that serve as semantic contexts for reasoning, decision making and prediction.
Our position is that the role of cognitive imagination is still greatly
underestimated, and this creates numerous problems and diminishes the current
capabilities of AI. For instance, when reasoning, humans rely on imaginary
contexts to retrieve background info. They also constantly return to the
context for semantic verification that their reasoning is still reasonable.
Thus, reasoning without imagination is blind. This paper is a call for greater
attention to cognitive imagination as the next promising breakthrough in
artificial intelligence. As an instrument for simulating cognitive imagination,
we propose semantic models -- a new approach to mathematical models that can
learn, like neural networks, and are based on probabilistic causal
relationships. Semantic models can simulate cognitive imagination because they
ensure the consistency of imaginary contexts and implement a glass-box approach
that allows the context to be manipulated as a holistic and coherent system of
interrelated facts glued together with causal relations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有精确算法在随时行为上的不足，缺乏对现有随时策略的系统比较。

Method: 提出CA-DL8.5算法，结合分支定界剪枝和基于重启的束搜索，允许模块化集成多种启发式方法。

Result: 实验表明，基于LDS的CA-DL8.5在随时性能上表现最佳，优于其他变体和Blossom算法。

Conclusion: CA-DL8.5为决策树学习提供了一个通用框架，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Finding an optimal decision tree that minimizes classification error is known
to be NP-hard. While exact algorithms based on MILP, CP, SAT, or dynamic
programming guarantee optimality, they often suffer from poor anytime behavior
-- meaning they struggle to find high-quality decision trees quickly when the
search is stopped before completion -- due to unbalanced search space
exploration. To address this, several anytime extensions of exact methods have
been proposed, such as LDS-DL8.5, Top-k-DL8.5, and Blossom, but they have not
been systematically compared, making it difficult to assess their relative
effectiveness. In this paper, we propose CA-DL8.5, a generic, complete, and
anytime beam search algorithm that extends the DL8.5 framework and unifies some
existing anytime strategies. In particular, CA-DL8.5 generalizes previous
approaches LDS-DL8.5 and Top-k-DL8.5, by allowing the integration of various
heuristics and relaxation mechanisms through a modular design. The algorithm
reuses DL8.5's efficient branch-and-bound pruning and trie-based caching,
combined with a restart-based beam search that gradually relaxes pruning
criteria to improve solution quality over time. Our contributions are twofold:
(1) We introduce this new generic framework for exact and anytime decision tree
learning, enabling the incorporation of diverse heuristics and search
strategies; (2) We conduct a rigorous empirical comparison of several
instantiations of CA-DL8.5 -- based on Purity, Gain, Discrepancy, and Top-k
heuristics -- using an anytime evaluation metric called the primal gap
integral. Experimental results on standard classification benchmarks show that
CA-DL8.5 using LDS (limited discrepancy) consistently provides the best anytime
performance, outperforming both other CA-DL8.5 variants and the Blossom
algorithm while maintaining completeness and optimality guarantees.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于深度强化学习（DRL）和鸟瞰图（BEV）感知的新型自动驾驶方法，结合了高效的时空特征提取网络Mamba-BEV和ME³-BEV框架，显著提升了动态城市驾驶场景中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模块化方法存在错误传播和协调问题，端到端学习系统则面临计算瓶颈。本文旨在通过结合BEV感知和DRL，解决这些问题。

Method: 提出Mamba-BEV模型，结合BEV感知和Mamba框架进行时空特征建模，并进一步开发ME³-BEV框架用于端到端DRL。

Result: 在CARLA模拟器上的实验表明，ME³-BEV在碰撞率和轨迹精度等多项指标上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: ME³-BEV为实时自动驾驶提供了一种高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems face significant challenges in perceiving complex
environments and making real-time decisions. Traditional modular approaches,
while offering interpretability, suffer from error propagation and coordination
issues, whereas end-to-end learning systems can simplify the design but face
computational bottlenecks. This paper presents a novel approach to autonomous
driving using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that integrates bird's-eye view
(BEV) perception for enhanced real-time decision-making. We introduce the
\texttt{Mamba-BEV} model, an efficient spatio-temporal feature extraction
network that combines BEV-based perception with the Mamba framework for
temporal feature modeling. This integration allows the system to encode vehicle
surroundings and road features in a unified coordinate system and accurately
model long-range dependencies. Building on this, we propose the
\texttt{ME$^3$-BEV} framework, which utilizes the \texttt{Mamba-BEV} model as a
feature input for end-to-end DRL, achieving superior performance in dynamic
urban driving scenarios. We further enhance the interpretability of the model
by visualizing high-dimensional features through semantic segmentation,
providing insight into the learned representations. Extensive experiments on
the CARLA simulator demonstrate that \texttt{ME$^3$-BEV} outperforms existing
models across multiple metrics, including collision rate and trajectory
accuracy, offering a promising solution for real-time autonomous driving.

Motivation: 研究GNNs与逻辑语言的关系，解决Barceló等人提出的开放性问题。

Result: 证明aggregate-combine-readout GNNs的逻辑表达能力严格超过C2逻辑。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅解决了GNNs的开放性问题，还为无穷逻辑的表达能力提供了新见解。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding the
expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) by relating them to logical
languages. This research has been been initialised by an influential result of
Barcel\'o et al. (2020), who showed that the graded modal logic (or a guarded
fragment of the logic C2), characterises the logical expressiveness of
aggregate-combine GNNs. As a ``challenging open problem'' they left the
question whether full C2 characterises the logical expressiveness of
aggregate-combine-readout GNNs. This question has remained unresolved despite
several attempts. In this paper, we solve the above open problem by proving
that the logical expressiveness of aggregate-combine-readout GNNs strictly
exceeds that of C2. This result holds over both undirected and directed graphs.
Beyond its implications for GNNs, our work also leads to purely logical
insights on the expressive power of infinitary logics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决表格推理任务中依赖标注数据或复杂数据增强的问题，以及LLM在此类任务中表现不佳的局限性。

Method: PanelTR框架采用LLM科学家代理，通过个体调查、自我审查和协作同行评审的流程，实现语义级迁移。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，PanelTR表现优于普通LLM，媲美全监督模型，且无需训练数据。

Conclusion: 结构化科学方法能有效处理复杂任务，具备零样本上下文中的灵活语义理解能力。

Abstract: Table reasoning, including tabular QA and fact verification, often depends on
annotated data or complex data augmentation, limiting flexibility and
generalization. LLMs, despite their versatility, often underperform compared to
simple supervised models. To approach these issues, we introduce PanelTR, a
framework utilizing LLM agent scientists for robust table reasoning through a
structured scientific approach. PanelTR's workflow involves agent scientists
conducting individual investigations, engaging in self-review, and
participating in collaborative peer-review discussions. This process, driven by
five scientist personas, enables semantic-level transfer without relying on
data augmentation or parametric optimization. Experiments across four
benchmarks show that PanelTR outperforms vanilla LLMs and rivals fully
supervised models, all while remaining independent of training data. Our
findings indicate that structured scientific methodology can effectively handle
complex tasks beyond table reasoning with flexible semantic understanding in a
zero-shot context.

TL;DR: SKATE是一种新型评估框架，通过让大语言模型（LLMs）相互生成和解决可验证任务来评估其能力，具有自动化、可扩展和客观性等优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估方法需要大量领域专业知识，难以跟上LLMs的快速发展，因此需要一种更高效、通用的评估框架。

Method: SKATE将评估视为游戏，LLMs既作为任务生成者又作为解决者，通过生成可验证任务（如代码输出预测）来相互测试，并使用TrueSkill排名系统评估模型。

Result: 实验表明，较弱模型能可靠区分较强模型，LLMs会生成与自身能力相符的任务，SKATE能自动揭示模型间的细粒度能力差异。

Conclusion: SKATE为通用、可扩展的LLM评估框架提供了重要进展，能够跟上模型发展的步伐。

Abstract: Evaluating the capabilities and risks of foundation models is paramount, yet
current methods demand extensive domain expertise, hindering their scalability
as these models rapidly evolve. We introduce SKATE: a novel evaluation
framework in which large language models (LLMs) compete by generating and
solving verifiable tasks for one another. Our core insight is to treat
evaluation as a game: models act as both task-setters and solvers, incentivized
to create questions which highlight their own strengths while exposing others'
weaknesses. SKATE offers several key advantages, balancing scalability,
open-endedness, and objectivity. It is fully automated, data-free, and
scalable, requiring no human input or domain expertise. By using verifiable
tasks rather than LLM judges, scoring is objective. Unlike domain-limited
programmatically-generated benchmarks (e.g. chess-playing or spatial
reasoning), having LLMs creatively pose challenges enables open-ended and
scalable evaluation. As a proof of concept, we introduce LLM-set
code-output-prediction (COP) challenges as a verifiable and extensible
framework in which to test our approach. Using a TrueSkill-based ranking
system, we evaluate six frontier LLMs and find that: (1) weaker models can
reliably differentiate and score stronger ones, (2) LLM-based systems are
capable of self-preferencing behavior, generating questions that align with
their own capabilities, and (3) SKATE automatically surfaces fine-grained
capability differences between models. Our findings are an important step
towards general, scalable evaluation frameworks which can keep pace with LLM
progress.

Motivation: 传统元启发式算法依赖人工设计，而机器学习能利用组合优化解的结构特征，本研究旨在通过可解释AI进一步理解模型决策机制。

Result: 研究发现特征重要性存在差异，但某些特征始终是强预测因子，并提出统一框架以量化特征影响。

Conclusion: 特征重要性分析为元启发式算法设计提供了潜在指导机制，有助于更高效解决VRP。

Abstract: The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a complex optimization problem with
numerous real-world applications, mostly solved using metaheuristic algorithms
due to its $\mathcal{NP}$-Hard nature. Traditionally, these metaheuristics rely
on human-crafted designs developed through empirical studies. However, recent
research shows that machine learning methods can be used the structural
characteristics of solutions in combinatorial optimization, thereby aiding in
designing more efficient algorithms, particularly for solving VRP. Building on
this advancement, this study extends the previous research by conducting a
sensitivity analysis using multiple classifier models that are capable of
predicting the quality of VRP solutions. Hence, by leveraging explainable AI,
this research is able to extend the understanding of how these models make
decisions. Finally, our findings indicate that while feature importance varies,
certain features consistently emerge as strong predictors. Furthermore, we
propose a unified framework able of ranking feature impact across different
scenarios to illustrate this finding. These insights highlight the potential of
feature importance analysis as a foundation for developing a guidance mechanism
of metaheuristic algorithms for solving the VRP.

Motivation: 大语言模型在医疗领域的应用面临准确性挑战，特别是在药物禁忌领域，需要可靠的信息支持。

Method: 采用OpenAI的GPT-4o-mini作为基础模型，结合text-embedding-3-small生成嵌入，利用Langchain构建混合检索系统，并整合药物利用审查（DUR）数据。

Result: RAG框架显著提升了模型准确性，年龄组、妊娠和联合用药禁忌的准确率分别达到0.94、0.87和0.89。

Conclusion: 通过RAG框架增强LLMs，可以有效减少药物禁忌决策中的不确定性，提供更精确的信息。

Abstract: The versatility of large language models (LLMs) has been explored across
various sectors, but their application in healthcare poses challenges,
particularly in the domain of pharmaceutical contraindications where accurate
and reliable information is required. This study enhances the capability of
LLMs to address contraindications effectively by implementing a Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. Utilizing OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini as the base
model, and the text-embedding-3-small model for embeddings, our approach
integrates Langchain to orchestrate a hybrid retrieval system with re-ranking.
This system leverages Drug Utilization Review (DUR) data from public databases,
focusing on contraindications for specific age groups, pregnancy, and
concomitant drug use. The dataset includes 300 question-answer pairs across
three categories, with baseline model accuracy ranging from 0.49 to 0.57.
Post-integration of the RAG pipeline, we observed a significant improvement in
model accuracy, achieving rates of 0.94, 0.87, and 0.89 for contraindications
related to age groups, pregnancy, and concomitant drug use, respectively. The
results indicate that augmenting LLMs with a RAG framework can substantially
reduce uncertainty in prescription and drug intake decisions by providing more
precise and reliable drug contraindication information.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著改善了置信度校准，实现了优于现有基线的可靠性和准确性。

Conclusion: 置信度驱动的风险感知评估系统是提升LLM作为评估工具可靠性的关键。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used as automated judges, where
practical value depends on both accuracy and trustworthy, risk-aware judgments.
Existing approaches predominantly focus on accuracy, overlooking the necessity
of well-calibrated confidence, which is vital for adaptive and reliable
evaluation pipelines. In this work, we advocate a shift from accuracy-centric
evaluation to confidence-driven, risk-aware LLM-as-a-Judge systems, emphasizing
the necessity of well-calibrated confidence for trustworthy and adaptive
evaluation. We systematically identify the **Overconfidence Phenomenon** in
current LLM-as-a-Judges, where predicted confidence significantly overstates
actual correctness, undermining reliability in practical deployment. To
quantify this phenomenon, we introduce **TH-Score**, a novel metric measuring
confidence-accuracy alignment. Furthermore, we propose **LLM-as-a-Fuser**, an
ensemble framework that transforms LLMs into reliable, risk-aware evaluators.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially improves
calibration and enables adaptive, confidence-driven evaluation pipelines,
achieving superior reliability and accuracy compared to existing baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在评估MLLMs几何能力时忽略了辅助线构建和细粒度过程评估，无法全面衡量其长步推理能力。

Method: 构建包含2,186个几何问题的GeoLaux基准，设计五维评估策略，包括答案正确性、过程正确性、过程质量、辅助线影响和错误原因。

Result: 实验发现MLLMs在长步推理中性能显著下降，倾向于在证明问题中走捷径，且缺乏辅助线意识。

Conclusion: GeoLaux为评估MLLMs几何推理能力提供了新基准，并揭示了改进方向。

Abstract: Geometry problem solving (GPS) requires models to master diagram
comprehension, logical reasoning, knowledge application, numerical computation,
and auxiliary line construction. This presents a significant challenge for
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing benchmarks for
evaluating MLLM geometry skills overlook auxiliary line construction and lack
fine-grained process evaluation, making them insufficient for assessing MLLMs'
long-step reasoning abilities. To bridge these gaps, we present the GeoLaux
benchmark, comprising 2,186 geometry problems, incorporating both calculation
and proving questions. Notably, the problems require an average of 6.51
reasoning steps, with a maximum of 24 steps, and 41.8% of them need auxiliary
line construction. Building on the dataset, we design a novel five-dimensional
evaluation strategy assessing answer correctness, process correctness, process
quality, auxiliary line impact, and error causes. Extensive experiments on 13
leading MLLMs (including thinking models and non-thinking models) yield three
pivotal findings: First, models exhibit substantial performance degradation in
extended reasoning steps (nine models demonstrate over 50% performance drop).
Second, compared to calculation problems, MLLMs tend to take shortcuts when
solving proving problems. Third, models lack auxiliary line awareness, and
enhancing this capability proves particularly beneficial for overall geometry
reasoning improvement. These findings establish GeoLaux as both a benchmark for
evaluating MLLMs' long-step geometric reasoning with auxiliary lines and a
guide for capability advancement. Our dataset and code are included in
supplementary materials and will be released.

Abstract: Unifying probabilistic and logical learning is a key challenge in AI. We
introduce a Bayesian inductive logic programming approach that learns minimum
message length programs from noisy data. Our approach balances hypothesis
complexity and data fit through priors, which explicitly favour more general

several domains, including game playing and drug design, show that our method
significantly outperforms previous methods, notably those that learn minimum
description length programs. Our results also show that our approach is
data-efficient and insensitive to example balance, including the ability to
learn from exclusively positive examples.

Abstract: This technical report accompanies the LLM robustness leaderboard published by
PRISM Eval for the Paris AI Action Summit. We introduce PRISM Eval Behavior
Elicitation Tool (BET), an AI system performing automated red-teaming through
Dynamic Adversarial Optimization that achieves 100% Attack Success Rate (ASR)
against 37 of 41 state-of-the-art LLMs. Beyond binary success metrics, we
propose a fine-grained robustness metric estimating the average number of
attempts required to elicit harmful behaviors, revealing that attack difficulty
varies by over 300-fold across models despite universal vulnerability. We
introduce primitive-level vulnerability analysis to identify which jailbreaking
techniques are most effective for specific hazard categories. Our collaborative
evaluation with trusted third parties from the AI Safety Network demonstrates
practical pathways for distributed robustness assessment across the community.

### [234] [A "good regulator theorem" for embodied agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06326)
*Nathaniel Virgo,Martin Biehl,Manuel Baltieri,Matteo Capucci*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文重新审视了Conant和Ashby的定理，提出了一种更广义的“信念更新”模型概念，认为观察者在定义模型中起关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Conant和Ashby定理的局限性，并寻找一种更普适的理论框架来解释无显式模型的系统行为。

Method: 通过引入“信念更新”的概念，将模型定义为观察者对系统的外部解释。

Result: 提出了一种更广义的模型定义，适用于经典控制理论和内部状态调节，解决了原定理的局限性。

Conclusion: 模型不仅是系统的内在属性，还依赖于观察者的视角，这一理论更具普适性。

Abstract: In a classic paper, Conant and Ashby claimed that "every good regulator of a
system must be a model of that system." Artificial Life has produced many
examples of systems that perform tasks with apparently no model in sight; these
suggest Conant and Ashby's theorem doesn't easily generalise beyond its
restricted setup. Nevertheless, here we show that a similar intuition can be
fleshed out in a different way: whenever an agent is able to perform a
regulation task, it is possible for an observer to interpret it as having
"beliefs" about its environment, which it "updates" in response to sensory
input. This notion of belief updating provides a notion of model that is more
sophisticated than Conant and Ashby's, as well as a theorem that is more
broadly applicable. However, it necessitates a change in perspective, in that
the observer plays an essential role in the theory: models are not a mere
property of the system but are imposed on it from outside. Our theorem holds
regardless of whether the system is regulating its environment in a classic
control theory setup, or whether it's regulating its own internal state; the
model is of its environment either way. The model might be trivial, however,
and this is how the apparent counterexamples are resolved.

TL;DR: AntiCheatPT_256是一种基于Transformer的机器学习模型，用于检测《CS2》中的作弊行为，准确率达89.17%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线游戏作弊破坏游戏体验，现有反作弊系统难以应对不断演变的作弊方法。

Method: 使用公开数据集CS2CD，通过数据增强处理类别不平衡，训练Transformer模型。

Result: 模型在未增强测试集上达到89.17%准确率和93.36% AUC。

Conclusion: 该方法为数据驱动的作弊检测提供了可复现且实用的基线。

Abstract: Cheating in online video games compromises the integrity of gaming
experiences. Anti-cheat systems, such as VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat), face
significant challenges in keeping pace with evolving cheating methods without
imposing invasive measures on users' systems. This paper presents
AntiCheatPT\_256, a transformer-based machine learning model designed to detect
cheating behaviour in Counter-Strike 2 using gameplay data. To support this, we
introduce and publicly release CS2CD: A labelled dataset of 795 matches. Using
this dataset, 90,707 context windows were created and subsequently augmented to
address class imbalance. The transformer model, trained on these windows,
achieved an accuracy of 89.17\% and an AUC of 93.36\% on an unaugmented test
set. This approach emphasizes reproducibility and real-world applicability,
offering a robust baseline for future research in data-driven cheat detection.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出“解释性AI”作为补充范式，利用生成式AI能力作为人类理解的解释伙伴，而非仅提供算法透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释AI（XAI）方法过于抽象且非自适应，难以支持终端用户的实际理解需求。

Method: 提出八维概念模型，结合叙事沟通、自适应个性化和渐进披露原则，并通过医疗专业人员的快速情境设计方法验证。

Result: 用户更偏好上下文敏感的多模态解释，而非技术透明度。

Conclusion: 强调设计以人类理解为中心的AI系统的紧迫性，并提出了跨领域和文化背景的研究议程。

Abstract: Current explainable AI (XAI) approaches prioritize algorithmic transparency
and present explanations in abstract, non-adaptive formats that often fail to
support meaningful end-user understanding. This paper introduces "Explanatory
AI" as a complementary paradigm that leverages generative AI capabilities to
serve as explanatory partners for human understanding rather than providers of
algorithmic transparency. While XAI reveals algorithmic decision processes for
model validation, Explanatory AI addresses contextual reasoning to support
human decision-making in sociotechnical contexts. We develop a definition and
systematic eight-dimensional conceptual model distinguishing Explanatory AI
through narrative communication, adaptive personalization, and progressive
disclosure principles. Empirical validation through Rapid Contextual Design
methodology with healthcare professionals demonstrates that users consistently
prefer context-sensitive, multimodal explanations over technical transparency.
Our findings reveal the practical urgency for AI systems designed for human
comprehension rather than algorithmic introspection, establishing a
comprehensive research agenda for advancing user-centered AI explanation
approaches across diverse domains and cultural contexts.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种构建法律知识图谱的方法，填补法律领域知识图谱的空白，并验证其在暴力侵害妇女案件中的应用价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律决策需要全面的立法背景知识和最新案例信息，但法律领域知识图谱稀缺，因此开发了针对暴力侵害妇女案件的法律知识图谱。

Method: 采用两种互补方法：系统化的自底向上方法和基于大语言模型的新方案，结合结构化数据提取、本体开发和语义增强。

Result: 构建了针对暴力侵害妇女案件的法律知识图谱，并通过能力问题验证其有效性。

Conclusion: 该知识图谱可提升法律信息的可访问性，支持复杂查询，并为预测性司法机器学习工具提供重要知识组件。

Abstract: Legal decision-making process requires the availability of comprehensive and
detailed legislative background knowledge and up-to-date information on legal
cases and related sentences/decisions. Legal Knowledge Graphs (KGs) would be a
valuable tool to facilitate access to legal information, to be queried and
exploited for the purpose, and to enable advanced reasoning and machine
learning applications. Indeed, legal KGs may act as knowledge intensive
component to be used by pre-dictive machine learning solutions supporting the
decision process of the legal expert. Nevertheless, a few KGs can be found in
the legal domain. To fill this gap, we developed a legal KG targeting legal
cases of violence against women, along with clear adopted methodologies.
Specifically, the paper introduces two complementary approaches for automated
legal KG construction; a systematic bottom-up approach, customized for the
legal domain, and a new solution leveraging Large Language Models. Starting
from legal sentences publicly available from the European Court of Justice, the
solutions integrate structured data extraction, ontology development, and
semantic enrichment to produce KGs tailored for legal cases involving violence
against women. After analyzing and comparing the results of the two approaches,
the developed KGs are validated via suitable competency questions. The obtained
KG may be impactful for multiple purposes: can improve the accessibility to
legal information both to humans and machine, can enable complex queries and
may constitute an important knowledge component to be possibly exploited by
machine learning tools tailored for predictive justice.

Abstract: Real-world networks often benefit from capturing both local and global
interactions. Inspired by multi-modal analysis in brain imaging, where
structural and functional connectivity offer complementary views of network
organization, we propose a graph neural network framework that generalizes this
approach to other domains. Our method introduces a functional connectivity
block based on persistent graph homology to capture global topological
features. Combined with structural information, this forms a multi-modal
architecture called Functional Connectivity Graph Neural Networks. Experiments
show consistent performance gains over existing methods, demonstrating the
value of brain-inspired representations for graph-level classification across
diverse networks.

Motivation: NCA生长的生物体存在稳定性问题，如边界崩溃或肿瘤样生长，无法维持预期形状。本文旨在通过改进训练方法提升其稳定性。

Method: 在训练过程中引入带有简单约束的'identity'层，以增强NCA生长生物体的稳定性。

Result: 改进后的NCA模型在近距离生长时更稳定，仅需单一身份值即可实现稳定性提升，且观察到稳定生物体的自发运动现象。

Conclusion: 本研究为NCA生长生物体间的交互研究奠定了基础，为人工生物体在细胞层面的社会行为研究提供了可能。

Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs) offer a way to study the growth of
two-dimensional artificial organisms from a single seed cell. From the outset,
NCA-grown organisms have had issues with stability, their natural boundary
often breaking down and exhibiting tumour-like growth or failing to maintain
the expected shape. In this paper, we present a method for improving the
stability of NCA-grown organisms by introducing an 'identity' layer with simple
constraints during training.
  Results show that NCAs grown in close proximity are more stable compared with
the original NCA model. Moreover, only a single identity value is required to
achieve this increase in stability. We observe emergent movement from the
stable organisms, with increasing prevalence for models with multiple identity
values.
  This work lays the foundation for further study of the interaction between
NCA-grown organisms, paving the way for studying social interaction at a
cellular level in artificial organisms.

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了多模态推荐系统的性能，解决了语义不足和噪声问题。

Abstract: Multimodal recommendation systems have attracted increasing attention for
their improved performance by leveraging items' multimodal information. Prior
methods often build modality-specific item-item semantic graphs from raw
modality features and use them as supplementary structures alongside the
user-item interaction graph to enhance user preference learning. However, these
semantic graphs suffer from semantic deficiencies, including (1) insufficient
modeling of collaborative signals among items and (2) structural distortions
introduced by noise in raw modality features, ultimately compromising
performance. To address these issues, we first extract collaborative signals
from the interaction graph and infuse them into each modality-specific item
semantic graph to enhance semantic modeling. Then, we design a modulus-based
personalized embedding perturbation mechanism that injects perturbations with
modulus-guided personalized intensity into embeddings to generate contrastive
views. This enables the model to learn noise-robust representations through
contrastive learning, thereby reducing the effect of structural noise in
semantic graphs. Besides, we propose a dual representation alignment mechanism
that first aligns multiple semantic representations via a designed Anchor-based
InfoNCE loss using behavior representations as anchors, and then aligns
behavior representations with the fused semantics by standard InfoNCE, to
ensure representation consistency. Extensive experiments on four benchmark
datasets validate the effectiveness of our framework.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ROO（Request-Only Optimizations）的训练和建模范式，通过将用户请求作为训练数据单位，优化存储、训练效率和模型质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业级深度学习推荐模型（DLRMs）规模庞大，需要处理海量数据和复杂计算，亟需新的存储和训练算法以提升效率和质量。

Method: ROO范式通过协同设计数据（请求专用数据）、基础设施（基于请求的数据处理管道）和模型架构（请求专用神经架构），以用户请求为训练单位，实现特征去重和计算优化。

Result: ROO范式显著节省了数据存储空间，并通过去重计算和通信，支持更复杂的神经网络架构（如生成式推荐器）以更好地捕捉用户兴趣信号。

Conclusion: ROO范式为大规模推荐系统提供了一种高效的解决方案，同时提升了存储、训练效率和模型质量。

Abstract: Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) represent one of the largest
machine learning applications on the planet. Industry-scale DLRMs are trained
with petabytes of recommendation data to serve billions of users every day. To
utilize the rich user signals in the long user history, DLRMs have been scaled
up to unprecedented complexity, up to trillions of floating-point operations
(TFLOPs) per example. This scale, coupled with the huge amount of training
data, necessitates new storage and training algorithms to efficiently improve
the quality of these complex recommendation systems. In this paper, we present
a Request-Only Optimizations (ROO) training and modeling paradigm. ROO
simultaneously improves the storage and training efficiency as well as the
model quality of recommendation systems. We holistically approach this
challenge through co-designing data (i.e., request-only data), infrastructure
(i.e., request-only based data processing pipeline), and model architecture
(i.e., request-only neural architectures). Our ROO training and modeling
paradigm treats a user request as a unit of the training data. Compared with
the established practice of treating a user impression as a unit, our new
design achieves native feature deduplication in data logging, consequently
saving data storage. Second, by de-duplicating computations and communications
across multiple impressions in a request, this new paradigm enables highly
scaled-up neural network architectures to better capture user interest signals,
such as Generative Recommenders (GRs) and other request-only friendly
architectures.

Abstract: We present a novel graph neural network (GNN) architecture for
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that leverages query-aware attention
mechanisms and learned scoring heads to improve retrieval accuracy on complex,
multi-hop questions. Unlike traditional dense retrieval methods that treat
documents as independent entities, our approach constructs per-episode
knowledge graphs that capture both sequential and semantic relationships
between text chunks. We introduce an Enhanced Graph Attention Network with
query-guided pooling that dynamically focuses on relevant parts of the graph
based on user queries. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms standard dense retrievers on complex question
answering tasks, particularly for questions requiring multi-document reasoning.
Our implementation leverages PyTorch Geometric for efficient processing of
graph-structured data, enabling scalable deployment in production retrieval

Conclusion: AquiLLM解决了研究团队在知识管理中的关键问题，特别是对非正式和隐私敏感内容的处理，填补了现有RAG系统的不足。

Abstract: Research groups face persistent challenges in capturing, storing, and
retrieving knowledge that is distributed across team members. Although
structured data intended for analysis and publication is often well managed,
much of a group's collective knowledge remains informal, fragmented, or
undocumented--often passed down orally through meetings, mentoring, and
day-to-day collaboration. This includes private resources such as emails,
meeting notes, training materials, and ad hoc documentation. Together, these
reflect the group's tacit knowledge--the informal, experience-based expertise
that underlies much of their work. Accessing this knowledge can be difficult,
requiring significant time and insider understanding. Retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) systems offer promising solutions by enabling users to query
and generate responses grounded in relevant source material. However, most
current RAG-LLM systems are oriented toward public documents and overlook the
privacy concerns of internal research materials. We introduce AquiLLM
(pronounced ah-quill-em), a lightweight, modular RAG system designed to meet
the needs of research groups. AquiLLM supports varied document types and
configurable privacy settings, enabling more effective access to both formal
and informal knowledge within scholarly groups.

Abstract: Effective query reformulation is pivotal in narrowing the gap between a
user's exploratory search behavior and the identification of relevant products
in e-commerce environments. While traditional approaches predominantly model
query rewrites as isolated pairs, they often fail to capture the sequential and
transitional dynamics inherent in real-world user behavior. In this work, we
propose a novel framework that explicitly models transitional
queries--intermediate reformulations occurring during the user's journey toward
their final purchase intent. By mining structured query trajectories from
eBay's large-scale user interaction logs, we reconstruct query sequences that
reflect shifts in intent while preserving semantic coherence. This approach
allows us to model a user's shopping funnel, where mid-journey transitions
reflect exploratory behavior and intent refinement. Furthermore, we incorporate
generative Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce semantically diverse and
intent-preserving alternative queries, extending beyond what can be derived
through collaborative filtering alone. These reformulations can be leveraged to
populate Related Searches or to power intent-clustered carousels on the search
results page, enhancing both discovery and engagement. Our contributions
include (i) the formal identification and modeling of transitional queries,
(ii) the introduction of a structured query sequence mining pipeline for intent
flow understanding, and (iii) the application of LLMs for scalable,
intent-aware query expansion. Empirical evaluation demonstrates measurable
gains in conversion and engagement metrics compared to the existing Related
Searches module, validating the effectiveness of our approach in real-world
e-commerce settings.

Motivation: 现有评估方法缺乏领域覆盖、精细度不足且无法标准化比较RAG效果，因此需要一种更系统化的评估工具。

Method: 平台通过动态测试生成、模块化评估流程和自动构建知识库，量化RAG在准确性和效率上的提升。

Result: 评估显示RAG效果因领域而异，文化领域显著提升，数学领域则表现下降。

Conclusion: OmniBench RAG为RAG系统提供了可复现、领域感知的评估框架，强调了系统化评估的重要性。

Abstract: While Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is now widely adopted to enhance
LLMs, evaluating its true performance benefits in a reproducible and
interpretable way remains a major hurdle. Existing methods often fall short:
they lack domain coverage, employ coarse metrics that miss sub document
precision, and fail to capture computational trade offs. Most critically, they
provide no standardized framework for comparing RAG effectiveness across
different models and domains.
  We introduce OmniBench RAG, a novel automated platform for multi domain
evaluation of RAG systems. The platform quantifies performance gains across
accuracy and efficiency dimensions, spanning nine knowledge fields including
culture, geography, and health. We introduce two standardized metrics:
Improvements (accuracy gains) and Transformation (efficiency differences
between pre RAG and post RAG models), enabling reproducible comparisons across
models and tasks. The platform features dynamic test generation, modular
evaluation pipelines, and automated knowledge base construction. Our evaluation
reveals striking variability in RAG effectiveness, from significant gains in
culture to declines in mathematics, highlighting the critical importance of
systematic, domain aware assessment. A demonstration video is available at:

informative and personalized suggestion on outdoor trails. Challenges arise in
response to (1) how to provide accurate outdoor trail information via
conversational AI; and (2) how to enable usable and efficient recommendation
services. To address above, this paper discusses the preliminary and practical
lessons learned from developing Judy, an outdoor trail recommendation chatbot
based on the large language model (LLM) with retrieval augmented generation

the outdoor trails in Connecticut (CT), US. We have conducted web-based data
collection, outdoor trail data management, and LLM model performance studies on
the RAG-based recommendation. Our experimental results have demonstrated the
accuracy, effectiveness, and usability of Judy in recommending outdoor trails
based on the LLM with RAG.

Abstract: Institutions dependent on IT services and resources acknowledge the crucial
significance of an IT help desk system, that act as a centralized hub
connecting IT staff and users for service requests. Employing various Machine
Learning models, these IT help desk systems allow access to corrective actions
used in the past, but each model has different performance when applied to
different datasets. This work compares eleven Information Retrieval techniques
in a dataset of IT support tickets, with the goal of implementing a software
that facilitates the work of Information Technology support analysts. The best
results were obtained with the Sentence-BERT technique, in its multi-language
variation distilluse-base-multilingual-cased-v1, where 78.7% of the
recommendations made by the model were considered relevant. TF-IDF (69.0%),
Word2vec (68.7%) and LDA (66.3%) techniques also had consistent results.
Furthermore, the used datasets and essential parts of coding have been
published and made open source. It also demonstrated the practicality of a
support ticket recovery system by implementing a minimal viable prototype, and
described in detail the implementation of the system. Finally, this work
proposed a novel metric for comparing the techniques, whose aim is to closely
reflect the perception of the IT analysts about the retrieval quality.

natural language interactions. However, these systems often face the false
negative issue, where items that a user might like are incorrectly labeled as
negative during training, leading to suboptimal recommendations.Expanding the
label set through data augmentation presents an intuitive solution but faces
the challenge of balancing two key aspects: ensuring semantic relevance and
preserving the collaborative information inherent in CRS datasets. To address
these issues, we propose a novel data augmentation framework that first
leverages an LLM-based semantic retriever to identify diverse and semantically
relevant items, which are then filtered by a relevance scorer to remove noisy
candidates. Building on this, we introduce a two-stage training strategy
balancing semantic relevance and collaborative information. Extensive
experiments on two benchmark datasets and user simulators demonstrate
significant and consistent performance improvements across various
recommenders, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach in advancing CRS
performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态混合RAG系统，结合图查询与向量搜索，通过自主代理提升科学文献分析的准确性和可重复性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学出版物激增，传统综述方法效率低下，需要结合结构化元数据与全文分析的工具。现有混合RAG系统多为静态、依赖专有工具且缺乏不确定性估计。

Method: 构建基于Neo4j的知识图和FAISS向量存储，由Llama-3.3-70B代理动态选择GraphRAG或VectorRAG，实时调整生成策略并量化不确定性。

Result: 在合成基准测试中，系统在多项指标上显著优于基线，如VS上下文召回率提升0.63，整体上下文精确度提升0.56。

Conclusion: 该系统通过动态协调异构数据源，提升了科学发现的自主性和可扩展性。

Abstract: The surge in scientific publications challenges traditional review methods,
demanding tools that integrate structured metadata with full-text analysis.
Hybrid Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, combining graph queries
with vector search offer promise but are typically static, rely on proprietary
tools, and lack uncertainty estimates. We present an agentic approach that
encapsulates the hybrid RAG pipeline within an autonomous agent capable of (1)
dynamically selecting between GraphRAG and VectorRAG for each query, (2)
adapting instruction-tuned generation in real time to researcher needs, and (3)
quantifying uncertainty during inference. This dynamic orchestration improves
relevance, reduces hallucinations, and promotes reproducibility.
  Our pipeline ingests bibliometric open-access data from PubMed, arXiv, and
Google Scholar APIs, builds a Neo4j citation-based knowledge graph (KG), and
embeds full-text PDFs into a FAISS vector store (VS) using the all-MiniLM-L6-v2
model. A Llama-3.3-70B agent selects GraphRAG (translating queries to Cypher
for KG) or VectorRAG (combining sparse and dense retrieval with re-ranking).
Instruction tuning refines domain-specific generation, and bootstrapped
evaluation yields standard deviation for evaluation metrics.
  On synthetic benchmarks mimicking real-world queries, the Instruction-Tuned
Agent with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) outperforms the baseline,
achieving a gain of 0.63 in VS Context Recall and a 0.56 gain in overall
Context Precision. Additional gains include 0.24 in VS Faithfulness, 0.12 in
both VS Precision and KG Answer Relevance, 0.11 in overall Faithfulness score,
0.05 in KG Context Recall, and 0.04 in both VS Answer Relevance and overall
Precision. These results highlight the system's improved reasoning over
heterogeneous sources and establish a scalable framework for autonomous,
agentic scientific discovery.

Abstract: Visual search offers an intuitive way for customers to explore diverse
product catalogs, particularly in consumer-to-consumer (C2C) marketplaces where
listings are often unstructured and visually driven. This paper presents a
scalable visual search system deployed in Mercari's C2C marketplace, where
end-users act as buyers and sellers. We evaluate recent vision-language models
for zero-shot image retrieval and compare their performance with an existing
fine-tuned baseline. The system integrates real-time inference and background
indexing workflows, supported by a unified embedding pipeline optimized through
dimensionality reduction. Offline evaluation using user interaction logs shows
that the multilingual SigLIP model outperforms other models across multiple
retrieval metrics, achieving a 13.3% increase in nDCG@5 over the baseline. A
one-week online A/B test in production further confirms real-world impact, with
the treatment group showing substantial gains in engagement and conversion, up
to a 40.9% increase in transaction rate via image search. Our findings
highlight that recent zero-shot models can serve as a strong and practical
baseline for production use, which enables teams to deploy effective visual
search systems with minimal overhead, while retaining the flexibility to
fine-tune based on future data or domain-specific needs.

*Yuzhou Zhu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Streaming RAG 是一种动态检索增强框架，解决了静态 RAG 在高内存成本、数据新鲜度和语义覆盖上的不足，通过多向量筛选、小批量聚类和计数器过滤实现高效检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态 RAG 框架在处理动态数据流时面临高内存成本、延迟和语义覆盖不足的问题，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 结合多向量余弦筛选、小批量聚类和计数器过滤，维护紧凑的原型集，并通过增量索引更新机制实现实时刷新。

Result: 在实验中，Streaming RAG 显著提升了召回率（Recall@10 提高 3 点），延迟低于 15 毫秒，吞吐量超过 900 文档/秒。在问答和摘要任务中也有显著提升。

Conclusion: Streaming RAG 为检索增强技术设定了新的帕累托前沿，平衡了效率与性能。

Abstract: Dynamic streams from news feeds, social media, sensor networks, and financial
markets challenge static RAG frameworks. Full-scale indices incur high memory
costs; periodic rebuilds introduce latency that undermines data freshness;
naive sampling sacrifices semantic coverage. We present Streaming RAG, a
unified pipeline that combines multi-vector cosine screening, mini-batch
clustering, and a counter-based heavy-hitter filter to maintain a compact
prototype set. We further prove an approximation bound \$E\[R(K\_t)] \ge R^\* -
L \Delta\$ linking retrieval quality to clustering variance. An incremental
index upsert mechanism refreshes prototypes without interrupting queries.
Experiments on eight real-time streams show statistically significant gains in
Recall\@10 (up to 3 points, p < 0.01), end-to-end latency below 15 ms, and
throughput above 900 documents per second under a 150 MB budget. Hyperparameter
sensitivity analysis over cluster count, admission probability, relevance
threshold, and counter capacity validates default settings. In open-domain
question answering with GPT-3.5 Turbo, we record 3.2-point gain in Exact Match
and 2.8-point gain in F1 on SQuAD; abstractive summarization yields ROUGE-L
improvements. Streaming RAG establishes a new Pareto frontier for retrieval
augmentation.

Motivation: 标准NLP流程或微调语言模型在模糊、多意图或细节查询中表现不佳，需改进。

Method: 评估查询重写、RAG Fusion、关键词增强、意图识别和上下文重排序等技术，比较向量存储和图基RAG框架。

Result: 基于图的RAG表现最佳，结合意图识别、RAG Fusion和重排序后，在生成数据集和真实FAQ数据集上分别达到97.9%和89.6%准确率。

Conclusion: 综合意图识别、RAG Fusion和重排序的系统能有效处理复杂查询，显著优于基线模型。

Abstract: Many AI customer service systems use standard NLP pipelines or finetuned
language models, which often fall short on ambiguous, multi-intent, or
detail-specific queries. This case study evaluates recent techniques: query
rewriting, RAG Fusion, keyword augmentation, intent recognition, and context
reranking, for building a robust customer support system in the electric power
domain. We compare vector-store and graph-based RAG frameworks, ultimately
selecting the graph-based RAG for its superior performance in handling complex
queries. We find that query rewriting improves retrieval for queries using
non-standard terminology or requiring precise detail. RAG Fusion boosts
performance on vague or multifaceted queries by merging multiple retrievals.
Reranking reduces hallucinations by filtering irrelevant contexts. Intent
recognition supports the decomposition of complex questions into more targeted
sub-queries, increasing both relevance and efficiency. In contrast, keyword
augmentation negatively impacts results due to biased keyword selection. Our
final system combines intent recognition, RAG Fusion, and reranking to handle
disambiguation and multi-source queries. Evaluated on both a GPT-4-generated
dataset and a real-world electricity provider FAQ dataset, it achieves 97.9%
and 89.6% accuracy respectively, substantially outperforming baseline RAG
models.

Abstract: We present HySemRAG, a framework that combines Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)
pipelines with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to automate large-scale
literature synthesis and identify methodological research gaps. The system
addresses limitations in existing RAG architectures through a multi-layered
approach: hybrid retrieval combining semantic search, keyword filtering, and
knowledge graph traversal; an agentic self-correction framework with iterative
quality assurance; and post-hoc citation verification ensuring complete
traceability. Our implementation processes scholarly literature through eight
integrated stages: multi-source metadata acquisition, asynchronous PDF
retrieval, custom document layout analysis using modified Docling architecture,
bibliographic management, LLM-based field extraction, topic modeling, semantic
unification, and knowledge graph construction. The system creates dual data
products - a Neo4j knowledge graph enabling complex relationship queries and
Qdrant vector collections supporting semantic search - serving as foundational
infrastructure for verifiable information synthesis. Evaluation across 643
observations from 60 testing sessions demonstrates structured field extraction
achieving 35.1% higher semantic similarity scores (0.655 $\pm$ 0.178) compared
to PDF chunking approaches (0.485 $\pm$ 0.204, p < 0.000001). The agentic
quality assurance mechanism achieves 68.3% single-pass success rates with 99.0%
citation accuracy in validated responses. Applied to geospatial epidemiology
literature on ozone exposure and cardiovascular disease, the system identifies
methodological trends and research gaps, demonstrating broad applicability
across scientific domains for accelerating evidence synthesis and discovery.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在推荐系统中因数据结构差异导致的性能不足问题。

Method: 构建包含7个子任务的ITDR数据集，整合13个公开推荐数据，约20万实例。

Result: ITDR显著提升GLM-4等开源LLMs的推荐任务性能。

Conclusion: ITDR有效提升LLMs推荐能力，并分析了任务相关性及数据规模影响。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in
natural language processing tasks. However, in the field of recommendation
systems, due to the structural differences between user behavior data and
natural language, LLMs struggle to effectively model the associations between
user preferences and items. Although prompt-based methods can generate
recommendation results, their inadequate understanding of recommendation tasks
leads to constrained performance. To address this gap, in this work, we
construct a sufficient instruction tuning dataset, ITDR, which encompasses 7
subtasks across two core root tasks--user-item interaction and user-item
understanding. The dataset integrates data from 13 public recommendation
datasets and is built using manually crafted standardized templates, comprising
approximately 200,000 instances. Experimental results demonstrate that ITDR
significantly enhances the performance of mainstream open-source LLMs such as
GLM-4, Qwen2.5, Qwen2.5-Instruct and LLaMA-3.2 on recommendation tasks.
Furthermore, we analyze the correlations between tasks and explore the impact
of task descriptions and data scale on instruction tuning effectiveness.
Finally, we perform comparative experiments against closed-source LLMs with
substantial parameters. Our tuning dataset ITDR and the fine-tuned large
recommendation models can be accessed at https://github.com/hellolzk/ITDR.

Motivation: 财务文档中的表格结构提取和表示对监管和分析至关重要，但现有方法在复杂布局和多级标题下表现不佳。

Method: 使用2,152张图像-文本对的数据集，结合LoRA监督微调策略，优化模型生成高保真Markdown。

Result: 模型在基于标准的评估中达到92.20%的准确率，Markdown TEDS评分为96.53%，显著优于基线模型和专有模型。

Conclusion: 领域特定微调能高效解决财务文档自动化问题，性能优于大型通用模型且计算成本更低。

Abstract: Accurately extracting and representing the structure of tabular data from
financial documents remains a critical challenge in document understanding,
particularly for regulatory and analytical use cases. This study addresses the
complexity of converting financial tables from Malaysian audited financial
reports into Markdown format, a task complicated by rotated layouts,
multi-level headers, and implicit structural cues. We propose a fine-tuned
vision-language model (VLM), based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, optimized for
high-fidelity Markdown generation from document images. Our approach includes a
curated dataset of 2,152 image-text pairs with augmentations and a supervised
fine-tuning strategy using LoRA. To assess performance, we evaluated our model
on 100 out-of-sample tables using a dual framework: a criteria-based
LLM-as-a-judge for fine-grained accuracy and our novel Markdown
Tree-Edit-Distance-based Similarity (TEDS) metric for holistic structural
fidelity. Our model achieves a 92.20% overall accuracy on the criteria-based
assessment and a 96.53% Markdown TEDS score. This performance significantly
surpasses its Qwen2.5-VL-7B base model, larger-scale VLMs, and specialized
reasoning-enabled models. Compared to these self-hosted alternatives, it also
significantly reduces inference time. Furthermore, its accuracy exceeds that of
widely used proprietary models such as OpenAI's GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Flash.
These results demonstrate that domain-specific fine-tuning provides an
effective and efficient method to bridge the gap between unstructured financial
documents and downstream automation, rivalling much larger and more general
models without their computational overhead.

Motivation: RAG系统在领域特定知识中表现不佳，预训练嵌入性能下降且LLM检索器计算成本高。

Method: LMAR采用两阶段流程：1) LLM引导的三元组采样和合成数据增强；2) 对比嵌入适应和高效文本聚类。

Result: 实验表明LMAR在多个领域特定基准数据集上优于基线模型，且硬件需求适中、延迟低。

Conclusion: LMAR是一种实用且经济高效的领域特定适应解决方案，可无缝集成新兴RAG架构。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often struggle with
domain-specific knowledge due to performance deterioration of pre-trained
embeddings and prohibitive computational costs of large language model
(LLM)-based retrievers. While fine-tuning data augmentation embedding models
offers a promising direction, its effectiveness is limited by the need for
high-quality training data and reliable chunking strategies that preserve
contextual integrity. We propose LMAR (Language Model Augmented Retriever), a
model-agnostic framework that addresses these challenges by combining
LLM-guided data synthesis with contrastive embedding adaptation and efficient
text clustering. LMAR consists of a two-stage pipeline: (1) Triplet sampling
and synthetic data augmentation, where LLMs act as both labeler and validator
to ensure high-fidelity supervision throughout the pipeline. Experimental
results across multiple domain-specific benchmark datasets demonstrate that
LMAR outperforms multiple baseline models, while maintaining moderate hardware
requirements and low latency. Its model-agnostic nature further enables
seamless integration with emerging RAG architectures and text embedding models,
ensuring continual improvements without redesigning the pipeline. These results
highlight LMAR as a practical and cost-effective solution for scalable
domain-specific adaptation.

Motivation: 在推荐系统中，NDCG@K是评估推荐性能的金标准，但其优化存在挑战，如不连续性和Top-K截断问题。现有方法要么忽略截断，要么计算成本高且训练不稳定。

Method: 通过结合分位数技术处理Top-K截断，并推导出一个平滑上界来优化NDCG@K，提出了SL@K损失函数。

Result: 在四个真实数据集和三种推荐模型上的实验表明，SL@K平均性能提升了6.03%，且具有理论保证、计算高效、梯度稳定和抗噪声等优点。

Conclusion: SL@K是一种高效且稳定的推荐损失函数，显著提升了NDCG@K的优化效果。

Abstract: In the realm of recommender systems (RS), Top-$K$ ranking metrics such as
NDCG@$K$ are the gold standard for evaluating recommendation performance.
However, during the training of recommendation models, optimizing NDCG@$K$
poses significant challenges due to its inherent discontinuous nature and the
intricate Top-$K$ truncation. Recent efforts to optimize NDCG@$K$ have either
overlooked the Top-$K$ truncation or suffered from high computational costs and
training instability. To overcome these limitations, we propose SoftmaxLoss@$K$
(SL@$K$), a novel recommendation loss tailored for NDCG@$K$ optimization.
Specifically, we integrate the quantile technique to handle Top-$K$ truncation
and derive a smooth upper bound for optimizing NDCG@$K$ to address
discontinuity. The resulting SL@$K$ loss has several desirable properties,
including theoretical guarantees, ease of implementation, computational
efficiency, gradient stability, and noise robustness. Extensive experiments on
four real-world datasets and three recommendation backbones demonstrate that
SL@$K$ outperforms existing losses with a notable average improvement of 6.03%.

Method: 采用两阶段框架（意图识别和基于表格的问答），构建BIM特定数据集（1,740条查询），比较微调和提示学习。

Result: 微调在意图识别中表现更好，提示学习（如GPT-4o）在问答中更强。混合方法表现最均衡。

Conclusion: 混合方法适用于实际BIM场景，为设计智能语言驱动系统提供参考。

Abstract: Building Information Modeling (BIM) is essential for managing building data
across the entire lifecycle, supporting tasks from design to maintenance.
Natural Language Interface (NLI) systems are increasingly explored as
user-friendly tools for information retrieval in Building Information Modeling
(BIM) environments. Despite their potential, accurately extracting BIM-related
data through natural language queries remains a persistent challenge due to the
complexity use queries and specificity of domain knowledge. This study presents
a comparative analysis of two prominent approaches for developing NLI-based BIM
information retrieval systems: domain-specific fine-tuning and prompt-based
learning using large language models (LLMs). A two-stage framework consisting
of intent recognition and table-based question answering is implemented to
evaluate the effectiveness of both approaches. To support this evaluation, a
BIM-specific dataset of 1,740 annotated queries of varying types across 69
models is constructed. Experimental results show that domain-specific
fine-tuning delivers superior performance in intent recognition tasks, while
prompt-based learning, particularly with GPT-4o, shows strength in table-based
question answering. Based on these findings, this study identify a hybrid
configuration that combines fine-tuning for intent recognition with
prompt-based learning for question answering, achieving more balanced and
robust performance across tasks. This integrated approach is further tested
through case studies involving BIM models of varying complexity. This study
provides a systematic analysis of the strengths and limitations of each
approach and discusses the applicability of the NLI to real-world BIM
scenarios. The findings offer insights for researchers and practitioners in
designing intelligent, language-driven BIM systems.

Conclusion: 研究强调需要同时考虑技术性能和代表性平等的公平性评估。

Abstract: Algorithmic systems such as search engines and information retrieval
platforms significantly influence academic visibility and the dissemination of
knowledge. Despite assumptions of neutrality, these systems can reproduce or
reinforce societal biases, including those related to gender. This paper
introduces and applies a bias-preserving definition of algorithmic gender
fairness, which assesses whether algorithmic outputs reflect real-world gender
distributions without introducing or amplifying disparities. Using a
heterogeneous dataset of academic profiles from German universities and
universities of applied sciences, we analyse gender differences in metadata
completeness, publication retrieval in academic databases, and visibility in
Google search results. While we observe no overt algorithmic discrimination,
our findings reveal subtle but consistent imbalances: male professors are
associated with a greater number of search results and more aligned publication
records, while female professors display higher variability in digital
visibility. These patterns reflect the interplay between platform algorithms,
institutional curation, and individual self-presentation. Our study highlights
the need for fairness evaluations that account for both technical performance
and representational equality in digital systems.

Abstract: This paper presents LLM4ES, a novel framework that exploits large pre-trained

sequences are transformed into a textual representation, which is subsequently
used to fine-tune an LLM through next-token prediction to generate high-quality
embeddings. We introduce a text enrichment technique that enhances LLM
adaptation to event sequence data, improving representation quality for
low-variability domains. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM4ES achieves
state-of-the-art performance in user classification tasks in financial and
other domains, outperforming existing embedding methods. The resulting user
embeddings can be incorporated into a wide range of applications, from user
segmentation in finance to patient outcome prediction in healthcare.

Abstract: Large embedding tables are indispensable in modern recommendation systems,
thanks to their ability to effectively capture and memorize intricate details
of interactions among diverse entities. As we explore integrating large
embedding tables into Pinterest's ads ranking models, we encountered not only
common challenges such as sparsity and scalability, but also several obstacles
unique to our context. Notably, our initial attempts to train large embedding
tables from scratch resulted in neutral metrics. To tackle this, we introduced
a novel multi-faceted pretraining scheme that incorporates multiple pretraining
algorithms. This approach greatly enriched the embedding tables and resulted in
significant performance improvements. As a result, the multi-faceted large
embedding tables bring great performance gain on both the Click-Through Rate
(CTR) and Conversion Rate (CVR) domains. Moreover, we designed a CPU-GPU hybrid

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于用户群体行为的隐式反馈解析方法（G-UBS），通过群体上下文指导提升推荐系统的鲁棒性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显式反馈稀缺，隐式反馈噪声大，容易误判用户兴趣，影响推荐效果。

Method: G-UBS通过用户群体管理器（UGM）聚类用户生成群体画像，用户反馈建模器（UFM）采用群体感知的强化学习方法解析隐式反馈。

Result: 在IF-VR基准测试中，G-UBS显著优于主流方法，播放率提升4.0%，推理准确率提升14.9%。

Conclusion: G-UBS通过群体上下文指导，有效解决了隐式反馈噪声问题，提升了推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: User feedback is critical for refining recommendation systems, yet explicit
feedback (e.g., likes or dislikes) remains scarce in practice. As a more
feasible alternative, inferring user preferences from massive implicit feedback
has shown great potential (e.g., a user quickly skipping a recommended video
usually indicates disinterest). Unfortunately, implicit feedback is often
noisy: a user might skip a video due to accidental clicks or other reasons,
rather than disliking it. Such noise can easily misjudge user interests,
thereby undermining recommendation performance. To address this issue, we
propose a novel Group-aware User Behavior Simulation (G-UBS) paradigm, which
leverages contextual guidance from relevant user groups, enabling robust and
in-depth interpretation of implicit feedback for individual users.
Specifically, G-UBS operates via two key agents. First, the User Group Manager
(UGM) effectively clusters users to generate group profiles utilizing a
``summarize-cluster-reflect" workflow based on LLMs. Second, the User Feedback
Modeler (UFM) employs an innovative group-aware reinforcement learning
approach, where each user is guided by the associated group profiles during the
reinforcement learning process, allowing UFM to robustly and deeply examine the
reasons behind implicit feedback. To assess our G-UBS paradigm, we have
constructed a Video Recommendation benchmark with Implicit Feedback (IF-VR). To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first multi-modal benchmark for implicit
feedback evaluation in video recommendation, encompassing 15k users, 25k
videos, and 933k interaction records with implicit feedback. Extensive
experiments on IF-VR demonstrate that G-UBS significantly outperforms
mainstream LLMs and MLLMs, with a 4.0% higher proportion of videos achieving a
play rate > 30% and 14.9% higher reasoning accuracy on IF-VR.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了WebWatcher，一种多模态深度研究代理，具备增强的视觉-语言推理能力，通过合成数据训练和强化学习提升性能，并在新基准BrowseComp-VL上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多集中于文本信息，忽视了现实世界中的视觉信息，导致多模态深度研究代理面临更高挑战。

Method: WebWatcher利用高质量合成多模态轨迹进行冷启动训练，结合多种工具进行深度推理，并通过强化学习增强泛化能力。

Result: 实验表明，WebWatcher在四个挑战性VQA基准上显著优于基线方法、RAG流程和开源代理。

Conclusion: WebWatcher为复杂多模态信息检索任务提供了新方向。

Abstract: Web agents such as Deep Research have demonstrated superhuman cognitive
abilities, capable of solving highly challenging information-seeking problems.
However, most research remains primarily text-centric, overlooking visual
information in the real world. This makes multimodal Deep Research highly
challenging, as such agents require much stronger reasoning abilities in
perception, logic, knowledge, and the use of more sophisticated tools compared
to text-based agents. To address this limitation, we introduce WebWatcher, a
multi-modal Agent for Deep Research equipped with enhanced visual-language
reasoning capabilities. It leverages high-quality synthetic multimodal
trajectories for efficient cold start training, utilizes various tools for deep
reasoning, and further enhances generalization through reinforcement learning.
To better evaluate the capabilities of multimodal agents, we propose
BrowseComp-VL, a benchmark with BrowseComp-style that requires complex
information retrieval involving both visual and textual information.
Experimental results show that WebWatcher significantly outperforms proprietary
baseline, RAG workflow and open-source agents in four challenging VQA
benchmarks, which paves the way for solving complex multimodal
information-seeking tasks.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DGRE的双原型注意力图网络方法，用于跨市场推荐系统（CMRS），通过结合市场特定和共享的用户行为与商品特征，提升系统的泛化能力和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CMRS方法主要关注单一市场的特定偏好，忽视了不同市场间用户的共享偏好潜力。本文认为结合市场特定和共享的洞察可以提升CMRS的泛化性和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出DGRE方法，利用图表示学习从用户和商品中提取原型，捕捉市场特定和共享的洞察。具体包括聚类不同市场的用户以识别行为相似性（共享原型），以及聚合各市场内的商品特征（特定原型）。

Result: 在真实跨市场数据集上的实验表明，DGRE通过结合市场特定和共享的建模，显著提升了CMRS的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DGRE方法通过同时考虑市场特定和共享的洞察，为跨市场推荐系统提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-market recommender systems (CMRS) aim to utilize historical data from
mature markets to promote multinational products in emerging markets. However,
existing CMRS approaches often overlook the potential for shared preferences
among users in different markets, focusing primarily on modeling specific
preferences within each market. In this paper, we argue that incorporating both
market-specific and market-shared insights can enhance the generalizability and
robustness of CMRS. We propose a novel approach called Dual Prototype Attentive
Graph Network for Cross-Market Recommendation (DGRE) to address this. DGRE
leverages prototypes based on graph representation learning from both items and
users to capture market-specific and market-shared insights. Specifically, DGRE
incorporates market-shared prototypes by clustering users from various markets
to identify behavioural similarities and create market-shared user profiles.
Additionally, it constructs item-side prototypes by aggregating item features
within each market, providing valuable market-specific insights. We conduct
extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of DGRE on a real-world
cross-market dataset, and the results show that considering both
market-specific and market-sharing aspects in modelling can improve the
generalization and robustness of CMRS.

TL;DR: XSMoE框架通过轻量级可扩展专家网络解决流式推荐系统中用户偏好漂移和新物品冷启动问题，同时保持计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流式推荐系统中用户兴趣漂移和新物品缺乏反馈导致难以捕捉最新偏好，现有方法未针对用户偏好建模且忽略模态特征漂移。

Method: 提出XSMoE框架，通过冻结预训练编码器并附加可扩展专家网络，动态结合专家与主干输出，并采用剪枝策略保持模型紧凑。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，XSMoE在推荐质量和计算效率上均优于现有基线。

Conclusion: XSMoE通过可扩展专家网络有效捕捉多模态特征中的冷启动和偏好漂移，同时保持高效性。

Abstract: Streaming recommender systems (SRSs) are widely deployed in real-world
applications, where user interests shift and new items arrive over time. As a
result, effectively capturing users' latest preferences is challenging, as
interactions reflecting recent interests are limited and new items often lack
sufficient feedback. A common solution is to enrich item representations using
multimodal encoders (e.g., BERT or ViT) to extract visual and textual features.
However, these encoders are pretrained on general-purpose tasks: they are not
tailored to user preference modeling, and they overlook the fact that user
tastes toward modality-specific features such as visual styles and textual
tones can also drift over time. This presents two key challenges in streaming
scenarios: the high cost of fine-tuning large multimodal encoders, and the risk
of forgetting long-term user preferences due to continuous model updates.
  To tackle these challenges, we propose Expandable Side Mixture-of-Experts
(XSMoE), a memory-efficient framework for multimodal streaming recommendation.
XSMoE attaches lightweight side-tuning modules consisting of expandable expert
networks to frozen pretrained encoders and incrementally expands them in
response to evolving user feedback. A gating router dynamically combines expert
and backbone outputs, while a utilization-based pruning strategy maintains
model compactness. By learning new patterns through expandable experts without
overwriting previously acquired knowledge, XSMoE effectively captures both cold
start and shifting preferences in multimodal features. Experiments on three
real-world datasets demonstrate that XSMoE outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines in both recommendation quality and computational efficiency.

TL;DR: 论文提出QGpT方法，通过生成部分表格的合成问题来优化表格在嵌入空间中的表示，从而提升检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在开放领域表格问答中，检索器组件主要优化查询表示，而忽略了表格本身的嵌入表示与问题的对齐问题。

Method: 使用LLM基于部分表格生成合成问题，模拟用户查询，并将生成的问题与表格片段联合嵌入，增强语义对齐。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，QGpT显著提升了密集和延迟交互检索器的性能。

Conclusion: QGpT是一种简单有效的方法，通过优化表格表示，显著提升了检索性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in open-domain question answering over tables have widely
adopted large language models (LLMs) under the Retriever-Reader architecture.
Prior works have effectively leveraged LLMs to tackle the complex reasoning
demands of the Reader component, such as text-to-text, text-to-SQL, and multi
hop reasoning. In contrast, the Retriever component has primarily focused on
optimizing the query representation-training retrievers to retrieve relevant
tables based on questions, or to select keywords from questions for matching
table segments. However, little attention has been given to enhancing how
tables themselves are represented in embedding space to better align with
questions. To address this, we propose QGpT (Question Generation from Partial
Tables), a simple yet effective method that uses an LLM to generate synthetic
questions based on small portions of a table. These questions are generated to
simulate how a user might query the content of the table currently under
consideration. The generated questions are then jointly embedded with the
partial table segments used for generation, enhancing semantic alignment with
user queries. Without the need to embed entire tables, our method significantly
improves retrieval performance across multiple benchmarks for both dense and
late-interaction retrievers.

Motivation: 现有MRAG技术仅支持单模态输出，限制了实际应用，而现实需求需要多模态输入与输出。

Result: 轻量级3B插入器在质量和效率上均优于基线模型。

Conclusion: M2IO-R1框架为多模态生成提供了高效可控的解决方案。

Abstract: Current research on Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) enables
diverse multimodal inputs but remains limited to single-modality outputs,
restricting expressive capacity and practical utility. In contrast, real-world
applications often demand both multimodal inputs and multimodal outputs for
effective communication and grounded reasoning. Motivated by the recent success
of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in complex reasoning tasks for Large Language
Models (LLMs), we adopt RL as a principled and effective paradigm to address
the multi-step, outcome-driven challenges inherent in multimodal output
generation. Here, we introduce M2IO-R1, a novel framework for Multimodal
Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Generation (MRAMG) that supports both multimodal
inputs and outputs. Central to our framework is an RL-based inserter,
Inserter-R1-3B, trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization to guide image
selection and placement in a controllable and semantically aligned manner.
Empirical results show that our lightweight 3B inserter achieves strong
reasoning capabilities with significantly reduced latency, outperforming
baselines in both quality and efficiency.

Motivation: 现有Transformer-based推荐模型（如SASRec和BERT4Rec）虽然表现优异，但其模块化改进的叠加效果尚未系统评估，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过实验验证，结合SASRec的训练目标、LiGR Transformer层和Sampled Softmax Loss，构建了eSASRec模型，并进行了生产级和学术基准测试。

Result: eSASRec在学术基准上比最新SOTA模型（如ActionPiece）效果提升23%，在生产级基准上达到准确率与覆盖率的帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: eSASRec改进简单且无需额外特征，易于集成到现有推荐系统中，可作为未来复杂算法的强基线，开源实现已提供。

Abstract: Since their introduction, Transformer-based models, such as SASRec and
BERT4Rec, have become common baselines for sequential recommendations,
surpassing earlier neural and non-neural methods. A number of following
publications have shown that the effectiveness of these models can be improved
by, for example, slightly updating the architecture of the Transformer layers,
using better training objectives, and employing improved loss functions.
However, the additivity of these modular improvements has not been
systematically benchmarked - this is the gap we aim to close in this paper.
Through our experiments, we identify a very strong model that uses SASRec's
training objective, LiGR Transformer layers, and Sampled Softmax Loss. We call
this combination eSASRec (Enhanced SASRec). While we primarily focus on
realistic, production-like evaluation, in our preliminarily study we find that
common academic benchmarks show eSASRec to be 23% more effective compared to
the most recent state-of-the-art models, such as ActionPiece. In our main
production-like benchmark, eSASRec resides on the Pareto frontier in terms of
the accuracy-coverage tradeoff (alongside the recent industrial models HSTU and
FuXi. As the modifications compared to the original SASRec are relatively
straightforward and no extra features are needed (such as timestamps in HSTU),
we believe that eSASRec can be easily integrated into existing recommendation
pipelines and can can serve as a strong yet very simple baseline for emerging
complicated algorithms. To facilitate this, we provide the open-source
implementations for our models and benchmarks in repository

TL;DR: 提出一种基于用户行为信息的特征选择策略，通过混合矩阵分解和最大体积算法优化特征表示，提升冷启动推荐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决冷启动问题中无关或噪声特征对推荐性能的负面影响，同时减少计算资源消耗。

Method: 结合协同行为数据的相关性，使用混合矩阵分解和最大体积算法进行特征选择和排序。

Result: 在多种数据集和混合推荐模型中表现优异，尤其在冷启动场景下，能以最少特征实现高准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法在特征缩减和计算效率上优于现有技术，显著提升推荐系统的冷启动性能。

Abstract: Cold-start challenges in recommender systems necessitate leveraging auxiliary
features beyond user-item interactions. However, the presence of irrelevant or
noisy features can degrade predictive performance, whereas an excessive number
of features increases computational demands, leading to higher memory
consumption and prolonged training times.
  To address this, we propose a feature selection strategy that prioritizes the
user behavioral information. Our method enhances the feature representation by
incorporating correlations from collaborative behavior data using a hybrid
matrix factorization technique and then ranks features using a mechanism based
on the maximum volume algorithm. This approach identifies the most influential
features, striking a balance between recommendation accuracy and computational
efficiency. We conduct an extensive evaluation across various datasets and
hybrid recommendation models, demonstrating that our method excels in
cold-start scenarios by selecting minimal yet highly effective feature subsets.
Even under strict feature reduction, our approach surpasses existing feature
selection techniques while maintaining superior efficiency.
