### [1] [Calibrating Multimodal Consensus for Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20256)
*Guowei Zhong,Junjie Li,Huaiyu Zhu,Ruohong Huan,Yun Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CMC模型解决多模态情感识别中的语义不一致和文本主导问题，通过伪标签生成、参数融合和多模态共识路由实现更可靠的多模态融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视多模态间的语义不一致性（如文本与视觉的情感冲突），且常被文本模态主导而影响识别准确性。

Method: CMC包含伪标签生成模块用于自监督单模态预训练，参数融合模块和多模态共识路由用于多模态微调，缓解文本主导并引导融合达成更可靠共识。

Result: 在CH-SIMS、CH-SIMS v2、CMU-MOSI和CMU-MOSEI四个数据集上达到或超越SOTA性能，在语义不一致场景下表现突出。

Conclusion: CMC通过缓解文本主导和引导多模态共识，有效提升了多模态情感识别性能，特别是在语义不一致的情况下。

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) has made substantial
progress. Nevertheless, most existing approaches neglect the semantic
inconsistencies that may arise across modalities, such as conflicting emotional
cues between text and visual inputs. Besides, current methods are often
dominated by the text modality due to its strong representational capacity,
which can compromise recognition accuracy. To address these challenges, we
propose a model termed Calibrated Multimodal Consensus (CMC). CMC introduces a
Pseudo Label Generation Module (PLGM) to produce pseudo unimodal labels,
enabling unimodal pretraining in a self-supervised fashion. It then employs a
Parameter-free Fusion Module (PFM) and a Multimodal Consensus Router (MCR) for
multimodal finetuning, thereby mitigating text dominance and guiding the fusion
process toward a more reliable consensus. Experimental results demonstrate that
CMC achieves performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art methods
across four datasets, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI, and
exhibits notable advantages in scenarios with semantic inconsistencies on
CH-SIMS and CH-SIMS v2. The implementation of this work is publicly accessible
at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CMC.

### [2] [Fourier-Based GAN Fingerprint Detection using ResNet50](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19840)
*Sai Teja Erukude,Viswa Chaitanya Marella,Suhasnadh Reddy Veluru*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用频域分析和深度学习检测StyleGAN生成的图像，通过2D傅里叶变换和ResNet50网络，在频域中识别GAN图像的周期性伪影，准确率达92.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAN生成的逼真图像对图像取证和工业系统的内容真实性构成严重挑战，需要可靠的方法来区分真实和合成图像。

Method: 应用二维离散傅里叶变换将图像转换到频域，然后使用ResNet50神经网络在频域图像上训练分类模型。

Result: 频域模型达到92.8%的准确率和0.95的AUC，显著优于在原始空间域图像上训练的等效模型。

Conclusion: GAN生成的图像具有独特的频域特征，结合信号处理和深度学习的方法在数字取证和工业AI系统可信度方面具有重要潜力。

Abstract: The rapid rise of photorealistic images produced from Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) poses a serious challenge for image forensics and industrial
systems requiring reliable content authenticity. This paper uses
frequency-domain analysis combined with deep learning to solve the problem of
distinguishing StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Specifically, a
two-dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform (2D DFT) was applied to transform
images into the Fourier domain, where subtle periodic artifacts become
detectable. A ResNet50 neural network is trained on these transformed images to
differentiate between real and synthetic ones. The experiments demonstrate that
the frequency-domain model achieves a 92.8 percent and an AUC of 0.95,
significantly outperforming the equivalent model trained on raw spatial-domain
images. These results indicate that the GAN-generated images have unique
frequency-domain signatures or "fingerprints". The method proposed highlights
the industrial potential of combining signal processing techniques and deep
learning to enhance digital forensics and strengthen the trustworthiness of
industrial AI systems.

### [3] [GMFVAD: Using Grained Multi-modal Feature to Improve Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20268)
*Guangyu Dai,Dong Chen,Siliang Tang,Yueting Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GMFVAD方法，通过细粒度多模态特征减少视频异常检测中的冗余信息，在四个主要数据集上达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频异常检测方法在引入多模态信息时方式粗糙，忽略了视频片段中可能存在的大量冗余信息

Method: 基于视频片段生成细粒度多模态特征，总结主要内容，并引入基于原始视频字幕的文本特征来增强视觉特征的突出部分

Result: 在四个主要数据集上实现了最先进的性能，消融实验验证了性能提升源于冗余信息的减少

Conclusion: GMFVAD通过利用多模态信息的多样性来细化提取特征，有效减少视觉特征中的冗余，提升视频异常检测性能

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a challenging task that detects anomalous
frames in continuous surveillance videos. Most previous work utilizes the
spatio-temporal correlation of visual features to distinguish whether there are
abnormalities in video snippets. Recently, some works attempt to introduce
multi-modal information, like text feature, to enhance the results of video
anomaly detection. However, these works merely incorporate text features into
video snippets in a coarse manner, overlooking the significant amount of
redundant information that may exist within the video snippets. Therefore, we
propose to leverage the diversity among multi-modal information to further
refine the extracted features, reducing the redundancy in visual features, and
we propose Grained Multi-modal Feature for Video Anomaly Detection (GMFVAD).
Specifically, we generate more grained multi-modal feature based on the video
snippet, which summarizes the main content, and text features based on the
captions of original video will be introduced to further enhance the visual
features of highlighted portions. Experiments show that the proposed GMFVAD
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four mainly datasets. Ablation
experiments also validate that the improvement of GMFVAD is due to the
reduction of redundant information.

### [4] [Transformed Multi-view 3D Shape Features with Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19955)
*Márcus Vinícius Lobo Costa,Sherlon Almeida da Silva,Bárbara Caroline Benato,Leo Sampaio Ferraz Ribeiro,Moacir Antonelli Ponti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究结合Vision Transformers和对比学习目标在3D形状特征表示学习中的表现，在ModelNet10上达到90.6%的准确率，克服了CNN在捕捉形状关系方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机视觉方法在从2D图像识别3D物体时面临挑战，需要大量标注数据且CNN可能忽略关键的形状关系。

Method: 使用Vision Transformers架构配合对比监督和自监督学习目标，通过ViTs捕捉全局形状语义，对比学习优化局部判别特征。

Result: 在ModelNet10上监督对比损失达到约90.6%的准确率，证明了ViTs与对比学习结合在多视角3D分析中的有效性。

Conclusion: ViTs与对比学习的结合能够克服对大量标注数据的依赖和CNN在捕捉形状关系方面的限制，为3D表示学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges in representation learning of 3D shape
features by investigating state-of-the-art backbones paired with both
contrastive supervised and self-supervised learning objectives. Computer vision
methods struggle with recognizing 3D objects from 2D images, often requiring
extensive labeled data and relying on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that
may overlook crucial shape relationships. Our work demonstrates that Vision
Transformers (ViTs) based architectures, when paired with modern contrastive
objectives, achieve promising results in multi-view 3D analysis on our
downstream tasks, unifying contrastive and 3D shape understanding pipelines.
For example, supervised contrastive losses reached about 90.6% accuracy on
ModelNet10. The use of ViTs and contrastive learning, leveraging ViTs' ability
to understand overall shapes and contrastive learning's effectiveness,
overcomes the need for extensive labeled data and the limitations of CNNs in
capturing crucial shape relationships. The success stems from capturing global
shape semantics via ViTs and refining local discriminative features through
contrastive optimization. Importantly, our approach is empirical, as it is
grounded on extensive experimental evaluation to validate the effectiveness of
combining ViTs with contrastive objectives for 3D representation learning.

### [5] [Causal Debiasing for Visual Commonsense Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20281)
*Jiayi Zou,Gengyun Jia,Bing-Kun Bao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文分析了视觉常识推理中的数据集偏见问题，提出了VCR-OOD数据集来评估模型泛化能力，并采用后门调整方法消除预测捷径偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉常识推理方法虽然预测准确率高，但忽视了数据集中的偏见问题，缺乏有效的去偏策略。研究发现文本和视觉数据中都存在共现和统计偏见。

Method: 分析VCR中的因果图和预测捷径，采用后门调整方法消除偏见。基于正确答案集合创建字典来消除预测捷径。

Result: 实验证明该去偏方法在不同数据集上都有效。

Conclusion: 提出的去偏方法能够有效消除VCR中的偏见，提高模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) refers to answering questions and
providing explanations based on images. While existing methods achieve high
prediction accuracy, they often overlook bias in datasets and lack debiasing
strategies. In this paper, our analysis reveals co-occurrence and statistical
biases in both textual and visual data. We introduce the VCR-OOD datasets,
comprising VCR-OOD-QA and VCR-OOD-VA subsets, which are designed to evaluate
the generalization capabilities of models across two modalities. Furthermore,
we analyze the causal graphs and prediction shortcuts in VCR and adopt a
backdoor adjustment method to remove bias. Specifically, we create a dictionary
based on the set of correct answers to eliminate prediction shortcuts.
Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our debiasing method across
different datasets.

### [6] [FutrTrack: A Camera-LiDAR Fusion Transformer for 3D Multiple Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19981)
*Martha Teiko Teye,Ori Maoz,Matthias Rottmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FutrTrack是一个模块化的相机-LiDAR多目标跟踪框架，通过引入基于transformer的平滑器和融合驱动的跟踪器，在现有3D检测器基础上构建。该框架采用多模态两阶段transformer精炼和跟踪流程，在nuScenes和KITTI数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单传感器跟踪方法在多模态传感器特征利用方面存在不足，需要开发能够有效整合相机和LiDAR数据的跟踪框架，以提高在遮挡和视角变化下的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用基于查询的跟踪框架，包含多模态两阶段transformer精炼和跟踪流程：1）使用时间平滑器在滑动窗口上精炼边界框序列，改善轨迹平滑度；2）融合跟踪器整合边界框与多模态BEV融合特征，无需显式运动模型，利用几何和语义线索进行跨帧身份传播。

Result: 在nuScenes测试集上达到74.7 aMOTA，在3D MOT基准测试中表现强劲，减少了身份切换，同时保持了竞争力的准确率。相比之前的单传感器方法，多模态传感器特征显著提升了基于查询的transformer跟踪方法性能。

Conclusion: FutrTrack提供了一个高效框架，即使数据有限且无需预训练，也能改进基于transformer的跟踪器，使其能够与其他基于神经网络的方法竞争。

Abstract: We propose FutrTrack, a modular camera-LiDAR multi-object tracking framework
that builds on existing 3D detectors by introducing a transformer-based
smoother and a fusion-driven tracker. Inspired by query-based tracking
frameworks, FutrTrack employs a multimodal two-stage transformer refinement and
tracking pipeline. Our fusion tracker integrates bounding boxes with multimodal
bird's-eye-view (BEV) fusion features from multiple cameras and LiDAR without
the need for an explicit motion model. The tracker assigns and propagates
identities across frames, leveraging both geometric and semantic cues for
robust re-identification under occlusion and viewpoint changes. Prior to
tracking, we refine sequences of bounding boxes with a temporal smoother over a
moving window to refine trajectories, reduce jitter, and improve spatial
consistency. Evaluated on nuScenes and KITTI, FutrTrack demonstrates that
query-based transformer tracking methods benefit significantly from multimodal
sensor features compared with previous single-sensor approaches. With an aMOTA
of 74.7 on the nuScenes test set, FutrTrack achieves strong performance on 3D
MOT benchmarks, reducing identity switches while maintaining competitive
accuracy. Our approach provides an efficient framework for improving
transformer-based trackers to compete with other neural-network-based methods
even with limited data and without pretraining.

### [7] [DMC$^3$: Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction for Egocentric Video Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20285)
*Jiayi Zou,Chaofan Chen,Bing-Kun Bao,Changsheng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了DMC³框架，通过反事实样本构建和对比优化来解决第一人称视频问答中的多事件理解和手物交互识别挑战，在EgoTaskQA和QAEGO4D数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了第一人称视角带来的独特挑战，如理解多个事件和识别手物交互，需要专门的方法来处理这些挑战。

Method: 提出双模态反事实对比构建框架，包含反事实样本构建模块和对比优化模块，通过事件描述改写和核心交互挖掘生成正负样本，并应用对比损失优化特征距离。

Result: 在EgoTaskQA的normal和indirect分割上分别达到52.51%和46.04%，在QAEGO4D上达到13.2%，均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: DMC³框架有效解决了第一人称视频问答中的独特挑战，通过反事实样本构建和对比学习显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Egocentric Video Question Answering (Egocentric VideoQA) plays an important
role in egocentric video understanding, which refers to answering questions
based on first-person videos. Although existing methods have made progress
through the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning, they ignore the unique
challenges posed by the first-person perspective, such as understanding
multiple events and recognizing hand-object interactions. To deal with these
challenges, we propose a Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction
(DMC$^3$) framework, which contains an egocentric videoqa baseline, a
counterfactual sample construction module and a counterfactual sample-involved
contrastive optimization. Specifically, We first develop a counterfactual
sample construction module to generate positive and negative samples for
textual and visual modalities through event description paraphrasing and core
interaction mining, respectively. Then, We feed these samples together with the
original samples into the baseline. Finally, in the counterfactual
sample-involved contrastive optimization module, we apply contrastive loss to
minimize the distance between the original sample features and the positive
sample features, while maximizing the distance from the negative samples.
Experiments show that our method achieve 52.51\% and 46.04\% on the
\textit{normal} and \textit{indirect} splits of EgoTaskQA, and 13.2\% on
QAEGO4D, both reaching the state-of-the-art performance.

### [8] [Improving Predictive Confidence in Medical Imaging via Online Label Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20011)
*Kushan Choudhury,Shubhrodeep Roy,Ankur Chanda,Shubhajit Biswas,Somenath Kuiry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在线标签平滑(OLS)在医学图像分类中通过动态调整软标签来改善模型校准和性能，相比传统方法在RadImageNet数据集上取得了更好的准确率和特征学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在医学图像分类中常产生过度自信的预测，影响医疗场景下的可靠性。传统标签平滑方法无法考虑类别间关系，需要更智能的解决方案。

Method: 使用在线标签平滑(OLS)方法，在训练过程中基于模型自身预测模式动态调整软标签，在RadImageNet数据集上评估了ResNet-50、MobileNetV2和VGG-19三种架构。

Result: OLS相比硬标签、传统标签平滑和教师无关知识蒸馏方法，持续提升了Top-1和Top-5分类准确率，并产生了更紧凑和分离良好的特征嵌入。

Conclusion: OLS不仅增强了预测性能，还改善了校准效果，是医学影像领域开发可信AI系统的实用有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks, have achieved
impressive results in medical image classification. However, these models often
produce overconfident predictions, which can undermine their reliability in
critical healthcare settings. While traditional label smoothing offers a simple
way to reduce such overconfidence, it fails to consider relationships between
classes by treating all non-target classes equally. In this study, we explore
the use of Online Label Smoothing (OLS), a dynamic approach that adjusts soft
labels throughout training based on the model's own prediction patterns. We
evaluate OLS on the large-scale RadImageNet dataset using three widely used
architectures: ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19. Our results show that OLS
consistently improves both Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy compared to
standard training methods, including hard labels, conventional label smoothing,
and teacher-free knowledge distillation. In addition to accuracy gains, OLS
leads to more compact and well-separated feature embeddings, indicating
improved representation learning. These findings suggest that OLS not only
strengthens predictive performance but also enhances calibration, making it a
practical and effective solution for developing trustworthy AI systems in the
medical imaging domain.

### [9] [Mitigating Cross-modal Representation Bias for Multicultural Image-to-Recipe Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20393)
*Qing Wang,Chong-Wah Ngo,Yu Cao,Ee-Peng Lim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的因果方法，通过预测图像中可能被忽略的烹饪元素，并将这些元素显式注入跨模态表示学习来缓解偏差，从而改善图像到食谱检索的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像到食谱检索方法假设食物图像能完全捕捉食谱的文本细节，但实际上图像只反映烹饪结果而非过程，导致表示学习偏向主导视觉元素，难以区分具有细微差异的相似食谱。

Method: 采用因果方法预测图像中可能被忽略的烹饪元素，并将这些元素显式注入跨模态表示学习，以缓解表示偏差。

Result: 在标准单语Recipe1M数据集和新构建的多语言多文化美食数据集上的实验表明，该方法能够发现细微的配料和烹饪动作，在两个数据集上都取得了令人印象深刻的检索性能。

Conclusion: 提出的因果表示学习方法能够有效缓解图像到食谱检索中的表示偏差，在单语和多语言多文化数据集上都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Existing approaches for image-to-recipe retrieval have the implicit
assumption that a food image can fully capture the details textually documented
in its recipe. However, a food image only reflects the visual outcome of a
cooked dish and not the underlying cooking process. Consequently, learning
cross-modal representations to bridge the modality gap between images and
recipes tends to ignore subtle, recipe-specific details that are not visually
apparent but are crucial for recipe retrieval. Specifically, the
representations are biased to capture the dominant visual elements, resulting
in difficulty in ranking similar recipes with subtle differences in use of
ingredients and cooking methods. The bias in representation learning is
expected to be more severe when the training data is mixed of images and
recipes sourced from different cuisines. This paper proposes a novel causal
approach that predicts the culinary elements potentially overlooked in images,
while explicitly injecting these elements into cross-modal representation
learning to mitigate biases. Experiments are conducted on the standard
monolingual Recipe1M dataset and a newly curated multilingual multicultural
cuisine dataset. The results indicate that the proposed causal representation
learning is capable of uncovering subtle ingredients and cooking actions and
achieves impressive retrieval performance on both monolingual and multilingual
multicultural datasets.

TL;DR: 提出针对鱼眼相机图像畸变的检测框架，通过预处理、后处理和模型集成策略，在AI City Challenge Track 4中获得第8名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鱼眼相机在交通监控中能捕获大视野，但其径向畸变和非均匀分辨率给标准目标检测器带来挑战，特别是在图像边界区域物体外观严重退化。

Method: 采用简单有效的预处理和后处理流程，结合多个先进检测模型的集成策略，提升在鱼眼图像中的检测一致性。

Result: 在2025 AI City Challenge Track 4中达到0.6366的F1分数，在62支队伍中排名第8。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了鱼眼图像固有的检测问题，证明了其在严重畸变条件下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Fisheye cameras offer an efficient solution for wide-area traffic
surveillance by capturing large fields of view from a single vantage point.
However, the strong radial distortion and nonuniform resolution inherent in
fisheye imagery introduce substantial challenges for standard object detectors,
particularly near image boundaries where object appearance is severely
degraded. In this work, we present a detection framework designed to operate
robustly under these conditions. Our approach employs a simple yet effective
pre and post processing pipeline that enhances detection consistency across the
image, especially in regions affected by severe distortion. We train several
state-of-the-art detection models on the fisheye traffic imagery and combine
their outputs through an ensemble strategy to improve overall detection
accuracy. Our method achieves an F1 score of0.6366 on the 2025 AI City
Challenge Track 4, placing 8thoverall out of 62 teams. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in addressing issues inherent to
fisheye imagery.

*Jiahao Meng,Xiangtai Li,Haochen Wang,Yue Tan,Tao Zhang,Lingdong Kong,Yunhai Tong,Anran Wang,Zhiyang Teng,Yujing Wang,Zhuochen Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Open-o3 Video是一个非代理框架，通过整合显式时空证据到视频推理中，在回答时突出关键时间戳、对象和边界框，使推理基于具体视觉观察。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频推理模型只生成文本推理轨迹而不指示关键证据出现的时间和位置，而将证据中心推理扩展到视频需要跨动态场景的联合时间跟踪和空间定位。

Method: 首先构建两个高质量数据集STGR-CoT-30k和STGR-RL-36k，提供统一的时空监督和推理轨迹；然后采用冷启动强化学习策略，设计多个专门奖励来共同鼓励答案准确性、时间对齐和空间精度。

Result: 在V-STAR基准测试中达到最先进性能，将Qwen2.5-VL基线的mAM提高了14.4%，mLGM提高了24.2%。在多个视频理解基准测试中均观察到一致改进。

Conclusion: Open-o3 Video不仅提高了准确性，其生成的推理轨迹还为测试时扩展提供了有价值信号，实现了置信度感知验证并提高了答案可靠性。

Abstract: Most video reasoning models only generate textual reasoning traces without
indicating when and where key evidence appears. Recent models such as OpenAI-o3
have sparked wide interest in evidence-centered reasoning for images, yet
extending this ability to videos is more challenging, as it requires joint
temporal tracking and spatial localization across dynamic scenes. We introduce
Open-o3 Video, a non-agent framework that integrates explicit spatio-temporal
evidence into video reasoning, and carefully collect training data and design
training strategies to address the aforementioned challenges. The model
highlights key timestamps, objects, and bounding boxes alongside its answers,
allowing reasoning to be grounded in concrete visual observations. To enable
this functionality, we first curate and build two high-quality datasets,
STGR-CoT-30k for SFT and STGR-RL-36k for RL, with carefully constructed
temporal and spatial annotations, since most existing datasets offer either
temporal spans for videos or spatial boxes on images, lacking unified
spatio-temporal supervision and reasoning traces. Then, we adopt a cold-start
reinforcement learning strategy with multiple specially designed rewards that
jointly encourage answer accuracy, temporal alignment, and spatial precision.
On V-STAR benchmark, Open-o3 Video achieves state-of-the-art performance,
raising mAM by 14.4% and mLGM by 24.2% on the Qwen2.5-VL baseline. Consistent
improvements are also observed on a broad range of video understanding
benchmarks, including VideoMME, WorldSense, VideoMMMU, and TVGBench. Beyond
accuracy, the reasoning traces produced by Open-o3 Video also provide valuable
signals for test-time scaling, enabling confidence-aware verification and
improving answer reliability.

*Damian Bowness,Charalambos Poullis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种实时渲染感知过滤方法，用于解决3D高斯泼溅模型在训练数据分布外视角下出现的视觉噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅模型在训练数据分布外的视角下会产生大量视觉噪声，这是由于缺乏训练数据导致模型在密度、颜色和几何预测上的不确定性。

Method: 利用中间梯度导出的敏感度分数，专门针对各向异性方向引起的不稳定性进行过滤，直接处理生成不确定性的核心问题。

Result: 实验评估表明，该方法相比现有的基于神经辐射场的方法（如BayesRays）显著提高了视觉质量、真实感和一致性。

Conclusion: 该过滤方法能够实时无缝集成到现有的3DGS渲染流程中，无需进行大量的后训练或微调，使3D重建系统在用户自由导航到原始训练视角外时仍能保持高视觉保真度。

Abstract: When viewing a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from camera positions
significantly outside the training data distribution, substantial visual noise
commonly occurs. These artifacts result from the lack of training data in these
extrapolated regions, leading to uncertain density, color, and geometry
predictions from the model.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel real-time render-aware filtering
method. Our approach leverages sensitivity scores derived from intermediate
gradients, explicitly targeting instabilities caused by anisotropic
orientations rather than isotropic variance. This filtering method directly
addresses the core issue of generative uncertainty, allowing 3D reconstruction
systems to maintain high visual fidelity even when users freely navigate
outside the original training viewpoints.
  Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method substantially improves
visual quality, realism, and consistency compared to existing Neural Radiance
Field (NeRF)-based approaches such as BayesRays. Critically, our filter
seamlessly integrates into existing 3DGS rendering pipelines in real-time,
unlike methods that require extensive post-hoc retraining or fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 提出BrainPuzzle混合框架，结合物理建模与机器学习，通过两阶段方法在低信噪比和稀疏孔径条件下实现准确的脑部声速成像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统物理方法受颅骨衰减和稀疏孔径限制，纯数据驱动方法在复杂波传播建模上存在困难，需要结合两者优势实现定量脑部超声成像。

Method: 两阶段混合框架：第一阶段使用逆时偏移处理多角度采集数据生成迁移片段；第二阶段使用基于Transformer的超分辨率编码器-解码器融合片段生成声速图像。

Result: 在两个合成数据集上的实验表明，BrainPuzzle在声速重建精度和图像完整性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在推进定量超声脑成像方面的潜力，特别是在低信噪比和稀疏孔径条件下。

Abstract: Ultrasound brain imaging remains challenging due to the large difference in
sound speed between the skull and brain tissues and the difficulty of coupling
large probes to the skull. This work aims to achieve quantitative transcranial
ultrasound by reconstructing an accurate speed-of-sound (SoS) map of the brain.
Traditional physics-based full-waveform inversion (FWI) is limited by weak
signals caused by skull-induced attenuation, mode conversion, and phase
aberration, as well as incomplete spatial coverage since full-aperture arrays
are clinically impractical. In contrast, purely data-driven methods that learn
directly from raw ultrasound data often fail to model the complex nonlinear and
nonlocal wave propagation through bone, leading to anatomically plausible but
quantitatively biased SoS maps under low signal-to-noise and sparse-aperture
conditions. To address these issues, we propose BrainPuzzle, a hybrid two-stage
framework that combines physical modeling with machine learning. In the first
stage, reverse time migration (time-reversal acoustics) is applied to
multi-angle acquisitions to produce migration fragments that preserve
structural details even under low SNR. In the second stage, a transformer-based
super-resolution encoder-decoder with a graph-based attention unit (GAU) fuses
these fragments into a coherent and quantitatively accurate SoS image. A
partial-array acquisition strategy using a movable low-count transducer set
improves feasibility and coupling, while the hybrid algorithm compensates for
the missing aperture. Experiments on two synthetic datasets show that
BrainPuzzle achieves superior SoS reconstruction accuracy and image
completeness, demonstrating its potential for advancing quantitative ultrasound
brain imaging.

Method: 使用开放模型和固定设置，在六个国家进行跨国家、跨时代和跨类别评估。结合标准自动指标、文化感知的检索增强视觉问答以及来自本地评审专家的专业人类判断。

Result: 研究发现：(1)在国家无关提示下，模型默认使用全球北方、现代风格的描绘，削弱了跨国家差异；(2)迭代图像到图像编辑会侵蚀文化保真度，即使传统指标保持稳定或改善；(3)编辑模型仅应用表面线索而非时代一致、上下文感知的变化，通常为全球南方目标保留源身份。

Conclusion: 当前系统中的文化敏感编辑仍然不可靠。通过发布标准化数据、提示和人类评估协议，为诊断和跟踪生成图像模型中的文化偏见提供了可复现、以文化为中心的基准。

Abstract: Generative image models produce striking visuals yet often misrepresent
culture. Prior work has examined cultural bias mainly in text-to-image (T2I)
systems, leaving image-to-image (I2I) editors underexplored. We bridge this gap
with a unified evaluation across six countries, an 8-category/36-subcategory
schema, and era-aware prompts, auditing both T2I generation and I2I editing
under a standardized protocol that yields comparable diagnostics. Using open
models with fixed settings, we derive cross-country, cross-era, and
cross-category evaluations. Our framework combines standard automatic metrics,
a culture-aware retrieval-augmented VQA, and expert human judgments collected
from native reviewers. To enable reproducibility, we release the complete image
corpus, prompts, and configurations. Our study reveals three findings: (1)
under country-agnostic prompts, models default to Global-North, modern-leaning
depictions that flatten cross-country distinctions; (2) iterative I2I editing
erodes cultural fidelity even when conventional metrics remain flat or improve;
and (3) I2I models apply superficial cues (palette shifts, generic props)
rather than era-consistent, context-aware changes, often retaining source
identity for Global-South targets. These results highlight that
culture-sensitive edits remain unreliable in current systems. By releasing
standardized data, prompts, and human evaluation protocols, we provide a
reproducible, culture-centered benchmark for diagnosing and tracking cultural
bias in generative image models.

*Bernd Pfrommer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FIBAR方法，使用IIR滤波器和新颖的陈旧像素检测算法，实现事件相机图像的异步重建，在CPU上高效运行，适用于某些任务如标记检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于神经网络的图像重建方法通常需要GPU且复杂，需要更简单、异步的解决方案。

Method: 使用时间数字IIR滤波器整合事件强度变化，通过新颖算法检测陈旧像素，对陈旧像素应用高斯滤波。

Result: FIBAR在笔记本电脑CPU上达到约42-140百万事件/秒的处理速度，重建图像比神经网络方法噪声更大且有重影，但足以完成某些任务。

Conclusion: FIBAR提供了一种简单高效的异步图像重建方法，虽然质量不如神经网络方法，但在特定应用中足够使用。

Abstract: Reconstructing an intensity image from the events of a moving event camera is
a challenging task that is typically approached with neural networks deployed
on graphics processing units. This paper presents a much simpler, FIlter Based
Asynchronous Reconstruction method (FIBAR). First, intensity changes signaled
by events are integrated with a temporal digital IIR filter. To reduce
reconstruction noise, stale pixels are detected by a novel algorithm that
regulates a window of recently updated pixels. Arguing that for a moving
camera, the absence of events at a pixel location likely implies a low image
gradient, stale pixels are then blurred with a Gaussian filter. In contrast to
most existing methods, FIBAR is asynchronous and permits image read-out at an
arbitrary time. It runs on a modern laptop CPU at about 42(140) million
events/s with (without) spatial filtering enabled. A few simple qualitative
experiments are presented that show the difference in image reconstruction
between FIBAR and a neural network-based approach (FireNet). FIBAR's
reconstruction is noisier than neural network-based methods and suffers from
ghost images. However, it is sufficient for certain tasks such as the detection
of fiducial markers. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的变换双边张量低秩表示模型TBTLRR，通过自适应学习酉变换来捕获全局相关性，并利用双边结构挖掘局部相关性，结合ℓ₁/₂范数和Frobenius范数处理复杂噪声，在图像聚类中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有张量低秩表示方法依赖固定变换，对噪声鲁棒性差，需要更有效捕获全局和局部相关性的自适应方法。

Method: TBTLRR模型引入数据自适应张量核范数，学习任意酉变换捕获全局相关性；利用双边结构挖掘局部相关性；集成ℓ₁/₂范数和Frobenius范数处理复杂噪声；基于ADMM开发高效优化算法。

Result: 大量实验验证了该方法在聚类任务中优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: TBTLRR通过自适应变换和双边结构有效提升了张量低秩表示在图像聚类中的性能，对复杂噪声具有更好的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Tensor low-rank representation (TLRR) has demonstrated significant success in
image clustering. However, most existing methods rely on fixed transformations
and suffer from poor robustness to noise. In this paper, we propose a novel
transformed bilateral tensor low-rank representation model called TBTLRR, which
introduces a data-adaptive tensor nuclear norm by learning arbitrary unitary
transforms, allowing for more effective capture of global correlations. In
addition, by leveraging the bilateral structure of latent tensor data, TBTLRR
is able to exploit local correlations between image samples and features.
Furthermore, TBTLRR integrates the $\ell_{1/2}$-norm and Frobenius norm
regularization terms for better dealing with complex noise in real-world
scenarios. To solve the proposed nonconvex model, we develop an efficient
optimization algorithm inspired by the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) and provide theoretical convergence. Extensive experiments
validate its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in clustering. The
code will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/TBTLRR.

TL;DR: Endoshare是一个开源、跨平台的应用，用于标准化和去识别化内窥镜手术视频，解决视频格式异构和隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频评估和外科数据科学在手术培训、研究和质量改进中有重要作用，但受限于异构的视频记录格式和视频共享的隐私担忧。

Method: 采用软件开发生命周期，基于用户反馈迭代开发。通过内部调查确定关键需求，采用隐私设计架构，外部调查评估可用性和采用度，并在不同硬件配置上进行基准测试。

Result: 原型测试显示高可用性（4.68/5和4.03/5），改进后外科医生报告高感知有用性（5.07/7）、易用性（5.15/7）、启发式可用性（4.38/5）和强烈推荐（9.20/10）。处理时间受处理模式、视频时长和机器计算能力影响。

Conclusion: Endoshare提供了一个透明、用户友好的标准化隐私保护手术视频管理流程，需要合规认证和更广泛的互操作性验证才能成为专有系统的可部署替代方案。

Abstract: Video-based assessment and surgical data science can advance surgical
training, research, and quality improvement. However, widespread use remains
limited by heterogeneous recording formats and privacy concerns associated with
video sharing. We present Endoshare, a source-available, cross-platform
application for merging, standardizing, and de-identifying endoscopic videos in
minimally invasive surgery. Development followed the software development life
cycle with iterative, user-centered feedback. During the analysis phase, an
internal survey of clinicians and computer scientists based on ten usability
heuristics identified key requirements that guided a privacy-by-design
architecture. In the testing phase, an external clinician survey combined the
same heuristics with Technology Acceptance Model constructs to assess usability
and adoption, complemented by benchmarking across different hardware
configurations. Four clinicians and four computer scientists initially tested
the prototype, reporting high usability (4.68 +/- 0.40/5 and 4.03 +/- 0.51/5),
with the lowest score (4.00 +/- 0.93/5) relating to label clarity. After
refinement, the testing phase surveyed ten surgeons who reported high perceived
usefulness (5.07 +/- 1.75/7), ease of use (5.15 +/- 1.71/7), heuristic
usability (4.38 +/- 0.48/5), and strong recommendation (9.20 +/- 0.79/10).
Processing time varied with processing mode, video duration (both p <= 0.001),
and machine computational power (p = 0.041). Endoshare provides a transparent,
user-friendly pipeline for standardized, privacy-preserving surgical video
management. Compliance certification and broader interoperability validation
are needed to establish it as a deployable alternative to proprietary systems.

*Hao Yu,Haoyu Chen,Yan Jiang,Wei Peng,Zhaodong Sun,Samuel Kaski,Guoying Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Attentive Convolution (ATConv)，通过引入自适应路由和侧向抑制机制，使卷积操作具备自注意力的核心优势，同时保持线性复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力机制虽然表达能力强，但二次复杂度限制了实际应用。卷积具有线性复杂度但性能存在差距，需要重新审视卷积设计原则。

Method: 提出ATConv，在卷积操作中注入自适应路由（根据语义内容动态调节位置信息流）和侧向抑制（通过token权重竞争抑制冗余）两个核心原则。

Result: 仅使用3×3核的ATConv在基础视觉任务中持续优于各种自注意力机制；基于ATConv的AttNet在ImageNet-1K上达到84.4%准确率；在扩散模型中替换自注意力可降低FID并加速采样。

Conclusion: 通过重新设计卷积操作的核心原则，ATConv成功融合了自注意力的表达优势与卷积的效率优势，为视觉主干网络提供了新的发展方向。

Abstract: Self-attention (SA) has become the cornerstone of modern vision backbones for
its powerful expressivity over traditional Convolutions (Conv). However, its
quadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for practical applications.
Given that Conv offers linear complexity and strong visual priors, continuing
efforts have been made to promote the renaissance of Conv. However, a
persistent performance chasm remains, highlighting that these modernizations
have not yet captured the intrinsic expressivity that defines SA. In this
paper, we re-examine the design of the CNNs, directed by a key question: what
principles give SA its edge over Conv? As a result, we reveal two fundamental
insights that challenge the long-standing design intuitions in prior research
(e.g., Receptive field). The two findings are: (1) \textit{Adaptive routing}:
SA dynamically regulates positional information flow according to semantic
content, whereas Conv employs static kernels uniformly across all positions.
(2) \textit{Lateral inhibition}: SA induces score competition among token
weighting, effectively suppressing redundancy and sharpening representations,
whereas Conv filters lack such inhibitory dynamics and exhibit considerable
redundancy. Based on this, we propose \textit{Attentive Convolution} (ATConv),
a principled reformulation of the convolutional operator that intrinsically
injects these principles. Interestingly, with only $3\times3$ kernels, ATConv
consistently outperforms various SA mechanisms in fundamental vision tasks.
Building on ATConv, we introduce AttNet, a CNN family that can attain
\textbf{84.4\%} ImageNet-1K Top-1 accuracy with only 27M parameters. In
diffusion-based image generation, replacing all SA with the proposed $3\times
3$ ATConv in SiT-XL/2 reduces ImageNet FID by 0.15 in 400k steps with faster
sampling. Code is available at: github.com/price112/Attentive-Convolution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了StableSketcher框架，通过优化VAE编码器和集成基于视觉问答的奖励函数，显著提升了扩散模型生成手绘草图的质量和文本对齐能力，并创建了首个包含实例级草图、标题和问答对的数据集SketchDUO。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型在生成像素级手绘草图方面存在挑战，特别是对于抽象表达的代表性示例。现有数据集主要依赖图像-标签对，缺乏实例级草图与详细描述的配对数据。

Method: 1. 微调变分自编码器优化潜在解码，更好地捕捉草图特征；2. 集成基于视觉问答的新奖励函数进行强化学习，改善文本-图像对齐和语义一致性。

Result: 实验表明StableSketcher生成具有更高风格保真度的草图，相比Stable Diffusion基线在提示对齐方面表现更好。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了手绘草图生成中的挑战，提供了首个包含丰富标注的草图数据集，为抽象表达生成任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Although recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly enriched
the quality of generated images, challenges remain in synthesizing pixel-based
human-drawn sketches, a representative example of abstract expression. To
combat these challenges, we propose StableSketcher, a novel framework that
empowers diffusion models to generate hand-drawn sketches with high prompt
fidelity. Within this framework, we fine-tune the variational autoencoder to
optimize latent decoding, enabling it to better capture the characteristics of
sketches. In parallel, we integrate a new reward function for reinforcement
learning based on visual question answering, which improves text-image
alignment and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
StableSketcher generates sketches with improved stylistic fidelity, achieving
better alignment with prompts compared to the Stable Diffusion baseline.
Additionally, we introduce SketchDUO, to the best of our knowledge, the first
dataset comprising instance-level sketches paired with captions and
question-answer pairs, thereby addressing the limitations of existing datasets
that rely on image-label pairs. Our code and dataset will be made publicly
available upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物图像和描述性标题可以视为物种潜在形态空间中的互补样本，但获取忠实、实例特定的标题存在挑战，这限制了自然语言监督在生物领域的应用。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型生成合成标题，结合维基百科的视觉信息和分类群定制格式示例来减少幻觉，产生准确的实例描述性标题，并利用这些标题训练BIOCAP模型。

Result: BIOCAP模型能够捕捉丰富的语义，在物种分类和图文检索任务中表现出强大的性能。

Conclusion: 描述性标题超越了标签的作用，在连接生物图像与多模态基础模型方面具有重要价值。

Abstract: This work investigates descriptive captions as an additional source of
supervision for biological multimodal foundation models. Images and captions
can be viewed as complementary samples from the latent morphospace of a
species, each capturing certain biological traits. Incorporating captions
during training encourages alignment with this shared latent structure,
emphasizing potentially diagnostic characters while suppressing spurious
correlations. The main challenge, however, lies in obtaining faithful,
instance-specific captions at scale. This requirement has limited the
utilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology compared with
many other scientific domains. We complement this gap by generating synthetic
captions with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by
Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples. These
domain-specific contexts help reduce hallucination and yield accurate,
instance-based descriptive captions. Using these captions, we train BIOCAP
(i.e., BIOCLIP with Captions), a biological foundation model that captures rich
semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and
text-image retrieval. These results demonstrate the value of descriptive
captions beyond labels in bridging biological images with multimodal foundation
models.

Abstract: While computer vision has advanced considerably for general object detection
and tracking, the specific problem of fast-moving tiny objects remains
underexplored. This paper addresses the significant challenge of detecting and
tracking rapidly moving small objects using an RGB-D camera. Our novel system
combines deep learning-based detection with physics-based tracking to overcome
the limitations of existing approaches. Our contributions include: (1) a
comprehensive system design for object detection and tracking of fast-moving
small objects in 3D space, (2) an innovative physics-based tracking algorithm
that integrates kinematics motion equations to handle outliers and missed
detections, and (3) an outlier detection and correction module that
significantly improves tracking performance in challenging scenarios such as
occlusions and rapid direction changes. We evaluated our proposed system on a
custom racquetball dataset. Our evaluation shows our system surpassing kalman
filter based trackers with up to 70\% less Average Displacement Error. Our
system has significant applications for improving robot perception on
autonomous platforms and demonstrates the effectiveness of combining
physics-based models with deep learning approaches for real-time 3D detection
and tracking of challenging small objects.

Abstract: A concept of light-fields computed from multiple view images on regular grids
has proven its benefit for scene representations, and supported realistic
renderings of novel views and photographic effects such as refocusing and
shallow depth of field. In spite of its effectiveness of light flow
computations, obtaining light fields requires either computational costs or
specialized devices like a bulky camera setup and a specialized microlens
array. In an effort to broaden its benefit and applicability, in this paper, we
propose a novel view synthesis method for light field generation from only
single images, named inverse image-based rendering. Unlike previous attempts to
implicitly rebuild 3D geometry or to explicitly represent objective scenes, our
method reconstructs light flows in a space from image pixels, which behaves in
the opposite way to image-based rendering. To accomplish this, we design a
neural rendering pipeline to render a target ray in an arbitrary viewpoint. Our
neural renderer first stores the light flow of source rays from the input
image, then computes the relationships among them through cross-attention, and
finally predicts the color of the target ray based on these relationships.
After the rendering pipeline generates the first novel view from a single input
image, the generated out-of-view contents are updated to the set of source
rays. This procedure is iteratively performed while ensuring the consistent
generation of occluded contents. We demonstrate that our inverse image-based
rendering works well with various challenging datasets without any retraining
or finetuning after once trained on synthetic dataset, and outperforms relevant
state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后处理方法未能充分利用模型logit空间中的丰富信息，需要更有效地利用logit关系来提升OOD检测性能。

Method: 提出LogitGap方法，显式利用最大logit与剩余logit之间的关系，并引入无训练策略自动识别最有信息的logit子集进行评分。

Result: 在视觉语言和纯视觉模型上的广泛实验表明，LogitGap在多种OOD检测场景和基准测试中一致达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: LogitGap通过有效利用logit空间关系，为OOD检测提供了高效且性能优越的后处理解决方案。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models in open-world applications. While post-hoc methods are
favored for their efficiency and ease of deployment, existing approaches often
underexploit the rich information embedded in the model's logits space. In this
paper, we propose LogitGap, a novel post-hoc OOD detection method that
explicitly exploits the relationship between the maximum logit and the
remaining logits to enhance the separability between in-distribution (ID) and
OOD samples. To further improve its effectiveness, we refine LogitGap by
focusing on a more compact and informative subset of the logit space.
Specifically, we introduce a training-free strategy that automatically
identifies the most informative logits for scoring. We provide both theoretical
analysis and empirical evidence to validate the effectiveness of our approach.
Extensive experiments on both vision-language and vision-only models
demonstrate that LogitGap consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance
across diverse OOD detection scenarios and benchmarks. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有数据集如PartNet依赖无纹理几何和专家标注，限制了可扩展性和实用性。需要更高质量、更易用的3D部件理解数据集。

Method: 构建包含50个类别、23,000多个纹理3D模型的数据集，提供细粒度层次化部件标注，并在类无关部件分割和3D部件中心问答两个任务上进行基准测试。

Abstract: Understanding objects at the level of their constituent parts is fundamental
to advancing computer vision, graphics, and robotics. While datasets like
PartNet have driven progress in 3D part understanding, their reliance on
untextured geometries and expert-dependent annotation limits scalability and
usability. We introduce PartNeXt, a next-generation dataset addressing these
gaps with over 23,000 high-quality, textured 3D models annotated with
fine-grained, hierarchical part labels across 50 categories. We benchmark
PartNeXt on two tasks: (1) class-agnostic part segmentation, where
state-of-the-art methods (e.g., PartField, SAMPart3D) struggle with
fine-grained and leaf-level parts, and (2) 3D part-centric question answering,
a new benchmark for 3D-LLMs that reveals significant gaps in open-vocabulary
part grounding. Additionally, training Point-SAM on PartNeXt yields substantial
gains over PartNet, underscoring the dataset's superior quality and diversity.
By combining scalable annotation, texture-aware labels, and multi-task
evaluation, PartNeXt opens new avenues for research in structured 3D
understanding.

Motivation: 在自动驾驶中，骑行者属于易受伤害的道路使用者，准确估计其姿态对于交叉意图分类、行为预测和碰撞避免至关重要。传统的6D姿态估计方法无法捕捉自行车铰接部件的角度变化，而这些变化会影响3D边界框和实际行驶方向。

Method: 提出的模型联合估计铰接式自行车的8D姿态和3D关键点，使用合成和真实图像数据的混合进行训练，以在真实图像上实现泛化。

Conclusion: 通过估计车把和踏板的旋转角度，该方法能够提供更细粒度的自行车姿态状态和行驶方向估计，为自动驾驶系统中的骑行者行为理解提供了更准确的信息。

Abstract: In Autonomous Driving, cyclists belong to the safety-critical class of
Vulnerable Road Users (VRU), and accurate estimation of their pose is critical
for cyclist crossing intention classification, behavior prediction, and
collision avoidance. Unlike rigid objects, articulated bicycles are composed of
movable rigid parts linked by joints and constrained by a kinematic structure.
6D pose methods can estimate the 3D rotation and translation of rigid bicycles,
but 6D becomes insufficient when the steering/pedals angles of the bicycle
vary. That is because: 1) varying the articulated pose of the bicycle causes
its 3D bounding box to vary as well, and 2) the 3D box orientation is not
necessarily aligned to the orientation of the steering which determines the
actual intended travel direction. In this work, we introduce a method for
category-level 8D pose estimation for articulated bicycles and cyclists from a
single RGB image. Besides being able to estimate the 3D translation and
rotation of a bicycle from a single image, our method also estimates the
rotations of its steering handles and pedals with respect to the bicycle body
frame. These two new parameters enable the estimation of a more fine-grained
bicycle pose state and travel direction. Our proposed model jointly estimates
the 8D pose and the 3D Keypoints of articulated bicycles, and trains with a mix
of synthetic and real image data to generalize on real images. We include an
evaluation section where we evaluate the accuracy of our estimated 8D pose
parameters, and our method shows promising results by achieving competitive
scores when compared against state-of-the-art category-level 6D pose estimators
that use rigid canonical object templates for matching.

Conclusion: TOMCAT方法通过多模态知识积累和自适应原型更新，有效解决了组合零样本学习中的分布偏移问题

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel
attribute-object compositions based on the knowledge learned from seen ones.
Existing methods suffer from performance degradation caused by the distribution
shift of label space at test time, which stems from the inclusion of unseen
compositions recombined from attributes and objects. To overcome the challenge,
we propose a novel approach that accumulates comprehensive knowledge in both
textual and visual modalities from unsupervised data to update multimodal
prototypes at test time. Building on this, we further design an adaptive update
weight to control the degree of prototype adjustment, enabling the model to
flexibly adapt to distribution shift during testing. Moreover, a dynamic
priority queue is introduced that stores high-confidence images to acquire
visual knowledge from historical images for inference. Considering the semantic
consistency of multimodal knowledge, we align textual and visual prototypes by
multimodal collaborative representation learning. Extensive experiments
indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four
benchmark datasets under both closed-world and open-world settings. Code will

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于GAN的无监督解耦表示学习模型IB-GAN，通过信息瓶颈框架优化GAN，在生成器中间层约束输入与输出之间的互信息，实现解耦和可解释的潜在空间表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用信息瓶颈框架优化GAN，解决现有方法在解耦表示学习中的局限性，实现更好的潜在空间解耦和样本生成质量。

Method: 在生成器中引入中间随机层，约束输入与生成输出之间的互信息，该中间层作为可学习的潜在分布与生成器联合端到端训练。

Result: 在dSprites和Color-dSprites数据集上达到与最先进β-VAE竞争的解耦分数，优于InfoGAN；在CelebA和3D Chairs数据集上，生成样本的视觉质量和多样性在FID得分上优于β-VAE和InfoGAN。

Conclusion: IB-GAN通过信息瓶颈框架有效实现了GAN的解耦表示学习，在解耦性能和生成质量方面均表现出色。

Abstract: We propose a new GAN-based unsupervised model for disentangled representation
learning. The new model is discovered in an attempt to utilize the Information
Bottleneck (IB) framework to the optimization of GAN, thereby named IB-GAN. The
architecture of IB-GAN is partially similar to that of InfoGAN but has a
critical difference; an intermediate layer of the generator is leveraged to
constrain the mutual information between the input and the generated output.
The intermediate stochastic layer can serve as a learnable latent distribution
that is trained with the generator jointly in an end-to-end fashion. As a
result, the generator of IB-GAN can harness the latent space in a disentangled
and interpretable manner. With the experiments on dSprites and Color-dSprites
dataset, we demonstrate that IB-GAN achieves competitive disentanglement scores
to those of state-of-the-art \b{eta}-VAEs and outperforms InfoGAN. Moreover,
the visual quality and the diversity of samples generated by IB-GAN are often
better than those by \b{eta}-VAEs and Info-GAN in terms of FID score on CelebA
and 3D Chairs dataset.

TL;DR: PPMStereo提出了一种基于记忆缓冲区的动态立体匹配方法，通过Pick-and-Play机制实现高效的长程时空一致性建模，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了深度估计的时间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 立体视频中的时间一致性深度估计对于增强现实等应用至关重要，但现有方法在建模长程时间一致性时面临计算效率与性能的权衡问题。

Method: 提出Pick-and-Play Memory (PPM)模块，包含'pick'过程选择最相关帧和'play'过程自适应加权所选帧进行时空聚合，模拟人类两阶段决策过程。

Result: 在Sintel数据集上取得0.62/1.11 TEPE（比BiDAStereo提升17.3%和9.02%），计算成本更低，在准确性和时间一致性方面达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: PPMStereo通过两阶段协作过程实现了紧凑且信息丰富的记忆缓冲区，有效解决了立体匹配中的时间一致性问题，为实时应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Temporally consistent depth estimation from stereo video is critical for
real-world applications such as augmented reality, where inconsistent depth
estimation disrupts the immersion of users. Despite its importance, this task
remains challenging due to the difficulty in modeling long-term temporal
consistency in a computationally efficient manner. Previous methods attempt to
address this by aggregating spatio-temporal information but face a fundamental
trade-off: limited temporal modeling provides only modest gains, whereas
capturing long-range dependencies significantly increases computational cost.
To address this limitation, we introduce a memory buffer for modeling
long-range spatio-temporal consistency while achieving efficient dynamic stereo
matching. Inspired by the two-stage decision-making process in humans, we
propose a \textbf{P}ick-and-\textbf{P}lay \textbf{M}emory (PPM) construction
module for dynamic \textbf{Stereo} matching, dubbed as \textbf{PPMStereo}. PPM
consists of a `pick' process that identifies the most relevant frames and a
`play' process that weights the selected frames adaptively for spatio-temporal
aggregation. This two-stage collaborative process maintains a compact yet
highly informative memory buffer while achieving temporally consistent
information aggregation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of
PPMStereo, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
temporal consistency. % Notably, PPMStereo achieves 0.62/1.11 TEPE on the
Sintel clean/final (17.3\% \& 9.02\% improvements over BiDAStereo) with fewer
computational costs. Codes are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注单个主体而非多交互人员的场景，多智能体动态在生成视频中的合理性尚未得到验证。

Method: 为I2V使用现有数据集的起始帧与真实视频比较，为T2V开发提示套件探索不同行人密度和交互，并提出了从像素空间重建2D鸟瞰轨迹的方法。

Result: 分析显示领先模型已学习到令人惊讶的有效多智能体行为先验，但存在合并和消失等失败模式。

Conclusion: 该工作为评估视频生成模型作为世界模拟器提供了严格基准，揭示了当前模型的优势和需要改进的领域。

Abstract: Large-scale video generation models have demonstrated high visual realism in
diverse contexts, spurring interest in their potential as general-purpose world
simulators. Existing benchmarks focus on individual subjects rather than scenes
with multiple interacting people. However, the plausibility of multi-agent
dynamics in generated videos remains unverified. We propose a rigorous
evaluation protocol to benchmark text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V)
models as implicit simulators of pedestrian dynamics. For I2V, we leverage
start frames from established datasets to enable comparison with a ground truth
video dataset. For T2V, we develop a prompt suite to explore diverse pedestrian
densities and interactions. A key component is a method to reconstruct 2D
bird's-eye view trajectories from pixel-space without known camera parameters.
Our analysis reveals that leading models have learned surprisingly effective
priors for plausible multi-agent behavior. However, failure modes like merging
and disappearing people highlight areas for future improvement.

TL;DR: 提出SPAN网络，将可疑意图检测从离散分类转为连续回归，捕捉可疑意图的波动演化特性，基于时序点过程理论建模长期依赖和累积效应，在HAI数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离散分类方法无法捕捉可疑意图的连续特性，限制了早期干预和可解释性。可疑意图具有波动演化和长期依赖特性，需要连续建模方法。

Method: 提出SPAN网络：1）定义可疑分数公式，建模连续变化和时序特性；2）引入可疑系数调制，用多模态信息调整可疑系数；3）提出概念锚定映射方法，将可疑行为与预定义意图概念关联。

Result: 在HAI数据集上，SPAN显著优于现有方法：MSE降低19.8%，平均mAP提升1.78%，在低频情况下mAP增益达2.74%，能更好捕捉细微行为变化。

Conclusion: 连续可疑建模方法相比离散分类系统，能实现更早检测和主动干预，大大提升了系统可解释性和安全应用的实际效用。

Abstract: Temporal Intention Localization (TIL) is crucial for video surveillance,
focusing on identifying varying levels of suspicious intentions to improve
security monitoring. However, existing discrete classification methods fail to
capture the continuous nature of suspicious intentions, limiting early
intervention and explainability. In this paper, we propose the Suspicion
Progression Analysis Network (SPAN), which shifts from discrete classification
to continuous regression, enabling the capture of fluctuating and evolving
suspicious intentions. We reveal that suspicion exhibits long-term dependencies
and cumulative effects, similar to Temporal Point Process (TPP) theory. Based
on these insights, we define a suspicion score formula that models continuous
changes while accounting for temporal characteristics. We also introduce
Suspicion Coefficient Modulation, which adjusts suspicion coefficients using
multimodal information to reflect the varying impacts of suspicious actions.
Additionally, the Concept-Anchored Mapping method is proposed to link
suspicious actions to predefined intention concepts, offering insights into
both the actions and their potential underlying intentions. Extensive
experiments on the HAI dataset show that SPAN significantly outperforms
existing methods, reducing MSE by 19.8% and improving average mAP by 1.78%.
Notably, SPAN achieves a 2.74% mAP gain in low-frequency cases, demonstrating
its superior ability to capture subtle behavioral changes. Compared to discrete
classification systems, our continuous suspicion modeling approach enables
earlier detection and proactive intervention, greatly enhancing system
explainability and practical utility in security applications.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了54个公开脑MRI数据集，揭示了数据规模、模态组成和预处理方法的不一致性，强调需要预处理感知和领域自适应策略来开发通用脑MRI基础模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑MRI基础模型的发展依赖于数据的规模、多样性和一致性，但缺乏对这些因素的系统评估。

Method: 在数据集层面分析模态组成、疾病覆盖和规模；在图像层面量化体素间距、方向和强度分布；评估预处理变异性；使用3D DenseNet121进行特征空间案例研究。

Result: 发现健康队列与临床人群之间存在强烈不平衡，预处理步骤改善了数据集内一致性但数据集间差异仍然存在，标准化预处理后仍存在可测量的残留协变量偏移。

Conclusion: 公共脑MRI资源存在显著变异性，仅靠数据协调无法消除数据集间偏差，需要预处理感知和领域自适应策略来开发通用脑MRI基础模型。

Abstract: The development of foundation models for brain MRI depends critically on the
scale, diversity, and consistency of available data, yet systematic assessments
of these factors remain scarce. In this study, we analyze 54 publicly
accessible brain MRI datasets encompassing over 538,031 to provide a
structured, multi-level overview tailored to foundation model development. At
the dataset level, we characterize modality composition, disease coverage, and
dataset scale, revealing strong imbalances between large healthy cohorts and
smaller clinical populations. At the image level, we quantify voxel spacing,
orientation, and intensity distributions across 15 representative datasets,
demonstrating substantial heterogeneity that can influence representation
learning. We then perform a quantitative evaluation of preprocessing
variability, examining how intensity normalization, bias field correction,
skull stripping, spatial registration, and interpolation alter voxel statistics
and geometry. While these steps improve within-dataset consistency, residual
differences persist between datasets. Finally, feature-space case study using a
3D DenseNet121 shows measurable residual covariate shift after standardized
preprocessing, confirming that harmonization alone cannot eliminate
inter-dataset bias. Together, these analyses provide a unified characterization
of variability in public brain MRI resources and emphasize the need for
preprocessing-aware and domain-adaptive strategies in the design of
generalizable brain MRI foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户提供的提示通常简短、非结构化且与训练数据不匹配，限制了基于扩散的文本到视频模型的生成潜力。

Method: 三阶段框架：1) RAPO阶段通过关系图检索语义相关修饰符并重构提示以匹配训练分布；2) SSPO阶段使用多源反馈迭代优化提示；3) 使用优化后的提示对微调LLM。

Result: 在五个最先进的T2V模型和五个基准测试中，RAPO++在语义对齐、组合推理、时间稳定性和物理合理性方面取得显著提升，大幅超越现有方法。

Conclusion: RAPO++是一个模型无关、成本高效且可扩展的解决方案，为T2V生成中的提示优化设定了新标准。

Abstract: Prompt design plays a crucial role in text-to-video (T2V) generation, yet
user-provided prompts are often short, unstructured, and misaligned with
training data, limiting the generative potential of diffusion-based T2V models.
We present \textbf{RAPO++}, a cross-stage prompt optimization framework that
unifies training-data--aligned refinement, test-time iterative scaling, and
large language model (LLM) fine-tuning to substantially improve T2V generation
without modifying the underlying generative backbone. In \textbf{Stage 1},
Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Optimization (RAPO) enriches user prompts with
semantically relevant modifiers retrieved from a relation graph and refactors
them to match training distributions, enhancing compositionality and
multi-object fidelity. \textbf{Stage 2} introduces Sample-Specific Prompt
Optimization (SSPO), a closed-loop mechanism that iteratively refines prompts
using multi-source feedback -- including semantic alignment, spatial fidelity,
temporal coherence, and task-specific signals such as optical flow -- yielding
progressively improved video generation quality. \textbf{Stage 3} leverages
optimized prompt pairs from SSPO to fine-tune the rewriter LLM, internalizing
task-specific optimization patterns and enabling efficient, high-quality prompt
generation even before inference. Extensive experiments across five
state-of-the-art T2V models and five benchmarks demonstrate that RAPO++
achieves significant gains in semantic alignment, compositional reasoning,
temporal stability, and physical plausibility, outperforming existing methods
by large margins. Our results highlight RAPO++ as a model-agnostic,
cost-efficient, and scalable solution that sets a new standard for prompt
optimization in T2V generation. The code is available at

TL;DR: FlowCycle是一个基于流的免反演图像编辑框架，通过可学习的噪声参数化图像损坏过程，并使用循环一致性约束来优化目标感知的中间状态，从而在保持源图像一致性的同时实现忠实修改。


<details>

Motivation: 当前文本到图像编辑方法采用目标无关的中间状态构建方式，主要关注源图像重建而忽略了与特定编辑目标之间的语义差距，导致在需要大幅修改时编辑能力有限或结果不一致。

Method: 提出FlowCycle框架，通过可学习的噪声参数化图像损坏过程，采用循环一致性过程优化这些噪声。通过从源图像到目标图像的迭代编辑和从目标图像回源图像的双重一致性约束，学习生成目标感知的中间状态。

Conclusion: FlowCycle通过目标感知的中间状态构建，解决了现有方法在文本到图像编辑中的局限性，实现了更好的编辑效果和一致性。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained text-to-image flow models have enabled
remarkable progress in text-based image editing. Mainstream approaches always
adopt a corruption-then-restoration paradigm, where the source image is first
corrupted into an ``intermediate state'' and then restored to the target image
under the prompt guidance. However, current methods construct this intermediate
state in a target-agnostic manner, i.e., they primarily focus on realizing
source image reconstruction while neglecting the semantic gaps towards the
specific editing target. This design inherently results in limited editability
or inconsistency when the desired modifications substantially deviate from the
source. In this paper, we argue that the intermediate state should be
target-aware, i.e., selectively corrupting editing-relevant contents while
preserving editing-irrelevant ones. To this end, we propose FlowCycle, a novel
inversion-free and flow-based editing framework that parameterizes corruption
with learnable noises and optimizes them through a cycle-consistent process. By
iteratively editing the source to the target and recovering back to the source
with dual consistency constraints, FlowCycle learns to produce a target-aware
intermediate state, enabling faithful modifications while preserving source
consistency. Extensive ablations have demonstrated that FlowCycle achieves
superior editing quality and consistency over state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统胎儿运动检测方法（如母体感知和胎心监护）存在主观性和准确性有限的问题，异常运动模式可能预示胎盘功能障碍或胎儿窘迫等并发症，需要更可靠的检测方法。

Method: 采用自监督对比学习框架CURL，结合空间和时间双重对比损失来学习鲁棒的运动表示，引入任务特定采样策略有效分离运动和非运动片段，并通过概率微调方法实现任意长度超声记录的可变推理。

Result: 在包含92个受试者、每个30分钟超声会话的内部数据集上，CURL实现了78.01%的敏感度和81.60%的AUROC，表现出可靠的胎儿运动分析能力。

Conclusion: 自监督对比学习在胎儿运动分析中具有巨大潜力，为改善产前监测和临床决策提供了新途径。

Abstract: Accurate fetal movement (FM) detection is essential for assessing prenatal
health, as abnormal movement patterns can indicate underlying complications
such as placental dysfunction or fetal distress. Traditional methods, including
maternal perception and cardiotocography (CTG), suffer from subjectivity and
limited accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Contrastive
Ultrasound Video Representation Learning (CURL), a novel self-supervised
learning framework for FM detection from extended fetal ultrasound video
recordings. Our approach leverages a dual-contrastive loss, incorporating both
spatial and temporal contrastive learning, to learn robust motion
representations. Additionally, we introduce a task-specific sampling strategy,
ensuring the effective separation of movement and non-movement segments during
self-supervised training, while enabling flexible inference on arbitrarily long
ultrasound recordings through a probabilistic fine-tuning approach. Evaluated
on an in-house dataset of 92 subjects, each with 30-minute ultrasound sessions,
CURL achieves a sensitivity of 78.01% and an AUROC of 81.60%, demonstrating its
potential for reliable and objective FM analysis. These results highlight the
potential of self-supervised contrastive learning for fetal movement analysis,
paving the way for improved prenatal monitoring and clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Adapting pretrained diffusion-based generative models for text-driven image
editing with negligible tuning overhead has demonstrated remarkable potential.
A classical adaptation paradigm, as followed by these methods, first infers the
generative trajectory inversely for a given source image by image inversion,
then performs image editing along the inferred trajectory guided by the target
text prompts. However, the performance of image editing is heavily limited by
the approximation errors introduced during image inversion by diffusion models,
which arise from the absence of exact supervision in the intermediate
generative steps. To circumvent this issue, we investigate the
parameter-efficient adaptation of VQ-based generative models for image editing,
and leverage their inherent characteristic that the exact intermediate
quantized representations of a source image are attainable, enabling more
effective supervision for precise image inversion. Specifically, we propose
\emph{EditInfinity}, which adapts \emph{Infinity}, a binary-quantized
generative model, for image editing. We propose an efficient yet effective
image inversion mechanism that integrates text prompting rectification and
image style preservation, enabling precise image inversion. Furthermore, we
devise a holistic smoothing strategy which allows our \emph{EditInfinity} to
perform image editing with high fidelity to source images and precise semantic
alignment to the text prompts. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench benchmark
across "add", "change", and "delete" editing operations, demonstrate the
superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based
baselines. Code available at: https://github.com/yx-chen-ust/EditInfinity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出大型视觉语言模型在长文本生成中更容易产生幻觉，研究发现这不是由长度本身导致的，而是由于长文本对上下文连贯性和完整性的依赖增加。作者提出了"诱导-检测-抑制"框架来主动管理幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在生成长文本时出现更多幻觉问题，传统观点认为是长度导致的错误累积，但作者质疑这种解释，希望探究更深层机制。

Method: 提出"诱导-检测-抑制"框架：通过设计特定上下文主动诱导幻觉，利用诱导实例早期检测高风险情况，在实际解码过程中抑制潜在的物体级幻觉。

Result: 在所有基准测试中都取得了持续显著的改进，证明了该框架的有效性。检测能力强大且幻觉缓解效果改善。

Conclusion: 幻觉风险不是由长度本身引起，而是长文本对上下文依赖增加的结果。该研究为深入探索LVLMs长文本幻觉问题提供了新视角和第一步探索。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in recent
years but are also prone to hallucination issues. They exhibit more
hallucinations in longer, free-form responses, often attributed to accumulated
uncertainties. In this paper, we ask: Does increased hallucination result
solely from length-induced errors, or is there a deeper underlying mechanism?
After a series of preliminary experiments and findings, we suggest that the
risk of hallucinations is not caused by length itself but by the increased
reliance on context for coherence and completeness in longer responses.
Building on these insights, we propose a novel "induce-detect-suppress"
framework that actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed
contexts, leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases,
and ultimately suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual
decoding. Our approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all
benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy. The strong detection and improved
hallucination mitigation not only validate our framework but, more importantly,
re-validate our hypothesis on context. Rather than solely pursuing performance
gains, this study aims to provide new insights and serves as a first step
toward a deeper exploration of hallucinations in LVLMs' longer responses.

Conclusion: COS3D通过协作场框架有效解决了开放词汇3D分割的挑战，在多个应用场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging task,
requiring a mutual understanding of both segmentation and language. However,
existing Gaussian-splatting-based methods rely either on a single 3D language
field, leading to inferior segmentation, or on pre-computed class-agnostic
segmentations, suffering from error accumulation. To address these limitations,
we present COS3D, a new collaborative prompt-segmentation framework that
contributes to effectively integrating complementary language and segmentation
cues throughout its entire pipeline. We first introduce the new concept of
collaborative field, comprising an instance field and a language field, as the
cornerstone for collaboration. During training, to effectively construct the
collaborative field, our key idea is to capture the intrinsic relationship
between the instance field and language field, through a novel
instance-to-language feature mapping and designing an efficient two-stage
training strategy. During inference, to bridge distinct characteristics of the
two fields, we further design an adaptive language-to-instance prompt
refinement, promoting high-quality prompt-segmentation inference. Extensive
experiments not only demonstrate COS3D's leading performance over existing
methods on two widely-used benchmarks but also show its high potential to
various applications,~\ie, novel image-based 3D segmentation, hierarchical
segmentation, and robotics. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出DualGround双分支架构，通过分离全局和局部语义来改进视频时序定位任务，在Moment Retrieval和Highlight Detection任务上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理跨模态注意力时对所有文本标记一视同仁，忽略了它们不同的语义角色，导致模型过度依赖[EOS]驱动的全局语义而未能有效利用词级信号，限制了细粒度时序对齐能力。

Method: DualGround双分支架构：将[EOS]标记通过句子级路径处理，将词标记聚类成语义单元进行局部定位；引入基于标记角色的跨模态交互策略和联合建模框架。

Result: 在QVHighlights和Charades-STA基准测试中，DualGround在Moment Retrieval和Highlight Detection任务上都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 解耦的语义建模在视频-语言对齐中非常有效，能够同时捕获粗粒度和局部语义，实现更具表达力和上下文感知的视频定位。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize temporal segments in long,
untrimmed videos that align with a given natural language query. This task
typically comprises two subtasks: Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection
(HD). While recent advances have been progressed by powerful pretrained
vision-language models such as CLIP and InternVideo2, existing approaches
commonly treat all text tokens uniformly during crossmodal attention,
disregarding their distinct semantic roles. To validate the limitations of this
approach, we conduct controlled experiments demonstrating that VTG models
overly rely on [EOS]-driven global semantics while failing to effectively
utilize word-level signals, which limits their ability to achieve fine-grained
temporal alignment. Motivated by this limitation, we propose DualGround, a
dual-branch architecture that explicitly separates global and local semantics
by routing the [EOS] token through a sentence-level path and clustering word
tokens into phrase-level units for localized grounding. Our method introduces
(1) tokenrole- aware cross modal interaction strategies that align video
features with sentence-level and phrase-level semantics in a structurally
disentangled manner, and (2) a joint modeling framework that not only improves
global sentence-level alignment but also enhances finegrained temporal
grounding by leveraging structured phrase-aware context. This design allows the
model to capture both coarse and localized semantics, enabling more expressive
and context-aware video grounding. DualGround achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection tasks across
QVHighlights and Charades- STA benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
disentangled semantic modeling in video-language alignment.

keypoint-based positional encoding, which captures only 2D coordinates while
neglecting object shape information, resulting in sensitivity to annotation
shifts and limited cross-view matching capability. To address these
limitations, we propose a mask-based positional encoding scheme that leverages
segmentation masks to capture both spatial coordinates and object silhouettes,
thereby upgrading the model from "location-aware" to "object-aware."
Furthermore, to tackle the challenge of large-span objects (e.g., elongated
buildings) in satellite imagery, we design a context enhancement module. This
module employs horizontal and vertical strip convolutional kernels to extract
long-range contextual features, enhancing feature discrimination among
strip-like objects. Integrating MPE and CEM, we present EDGeo, an end-to-end
framework for robust cross-view object geo-localization. Extensive experiments
on two public datasets (CVOGL and VIGOR-Building) demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 3.39% improvement in localization
accuracy under challenging ground-to-satellite scenarios. This work provides a
robust positional encoding paradigm and a contextual modeling framework for
advancing cross-view geo-localization research.

Abstract: Technologies like smartphones have become an essential in our daily lives. It
has made accessible to everyone including visually impaired individuals. With
the use of smartphone cameras, image capturing and processing have become more
convenient. With the use of smartphones and machine learning, the life of
visually impaired can be made a little easier. Daily tasks such as handling
money without relying on someone can be troublesome for them. For that purpose
this paper presents a real-time currency detection system designed to assist
visually impaired individuals. The proposed model is trained on a dataset

Motivation: 传统数据驱动模型未能充分利用CV-SAR数据中丰富的电磁散射特征，而这些特征是解决泛化性、可解释性和效率三难问题的关键。

Method: 采用压缩-聚合-压缩架构：第一阶段进行物理引导压缩，通过字典处理器嵌入物理先验；第二阶段聚合增强表示；第三阶段通过自蒸馏的紧凑分类头进行语义压缩。

Result: 在五个SAR基准测试中建立了参数高效识别的最先进水平，在数据稀缺和分布外场景下表现出卓越的泛化能力和可解释性。

Conclusion: KINN有效解决了表示三难问题，为SAR图像分析中的可信AI提供了新路径。

Abstract: Deep learning models for complex-valued Synthetic Aperture Radar (CV-SAR)
image recognition are fundamentally constrained by a representation trilemma
under data-limited and domain-shift scenarios: the concurrent, yet conflicting,
optimization of generalization, interpretability, and efficiency. Our work is
motivated by the premise that the rich electromagnetic scattering features
inherent in CV-SAR data hold the key to resolving this trilemma, yet they are
insufficiently harnessed by conventional data-driven models. To this end, we
introduce the Knowledge-Informed Neural Network (KINN), a lightweight framework
built upon a novel "compression-aggregation-compression" architecture. The
first stage performs a physics-guided compression, wherein a novel dictionary
processor adaptively embeds physical priors, enabling a compact unfolding
network to efficiently extract sparse, physically-grounded signatures. A
subsequent aggregation module enriches these representations, followed by a
final semantic compression stage that utilizes a compact classification head
with self-distillation to learn maximally task-relevant and discriminative
embeddings. We instantiate KINN in both CNN (0.7M) and Vision Transformer
(0.95M) variants. Extensive evaluations on five SAR benchmarks confirm that
KINN establishes a state-of-the-art in parameter-efficient recognition,
offering exceptional generalization in data-scarce and out-of-distribution
scenarios and tangible interpretability, thereby providing an effective
solution to the representation trilemma and offering a new path for trustworthy
AI in SAR image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Instruction-as-Reasoning范式，将指令视为动态分析路径，通过两阶段训练框架（SFT+RL）开发了UI-Ins模型，在GUI grounding任务上取得了SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作将指令视为用户意图的静态代理，忽视了指令多样性和质量对grounding性能的影响。研究发现现有数据集中23.3%的指令存在缺陷，且利用指令多样性可在推理时获得76%的相对性能提升。

Method: 提出Instruction-as-Reasoning范式，将指令视为动态分析路径；采用两阶段训练框架：先在合成的多样化指令上进行监督微调（SFT）以培养多视角推理能力，然后通过强化学习（RL）优化路径选择和组合。

Result: UI-Ins-7B和UI-Ins-32B在五个挑战性grounding基准上取得SOTA结果：UI-I2E-Bench 87.3%、ScreenSpot-Pro 57.0%、MMBench-GUI L2 84.9%。UI-Ins-7B在AndroidWorld上达到74.1%的成功率。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了grounding性能，还展现出涌现推理能力，能够在推理时选择性组合和合成新的指令路径，同时缓解了SFT+RL框架中的策略崩溃问题。

Abstract: GUI grounding, which maps natural-language instructions to actionable UI
elements, is a core capability of GUI agents. Prior works largely treats
instructions as a static proxy for user intent, overlooking the impact of
instruction diversity and quality on grounding performance. Through a careful
investigation of existing grounding datasets, we find a 23.3% flaw rate in
their instructions and show that inference-time exploitation of instruction
diversity yields up to a substantial 76% relative performance improvement. In
this paper, we introduce the Instruction-as-Reasoning paradigm, treating
instructions as dynamic analytical pathways that offer distinct perspectives
and enabling the model to select the most effective pathway during reasoning.
To achieve this, we propose a two-stage training framework: supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on synthesized, diverse instructions to instill
multi-perspective reasoning, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to
optimize pathway selection and composition. Our resulting models, UI-Ins-7B and
UI-Ins-32B, achieve state-of-the-art results on five challenging grounding
benchmarks and exhibit emergent reasoning, selectively composing and
synthesizing novel instruction pathways at inference. In particular, UI-Ins-32B
attains the best grounding accuracy, scoring 87.3% on UI-I2E-Bench, 57.0% on
ScreenSpot-Pro, and 84.9% on MMBench-GUI L2. Furthermore, our model
demonstrates strong agentic potential, achieving a 74.1% success rate on
AndroidWorld using UI-Ins-7B as the executor. Our in-depth analysis reveals
additional insights such as how reasoning can be formulated to enhance rather
than hinder grounding performance, and how our method mitigates policy collapse
in the SFT+RL framework. All code and model checkpoints will be publicly
released in https://github.com/alibaba/UI-Ins.

augmentation, and removal of orientation words; (ii) an LLM-based caption
refinement pipeline to align textual semantics with the distinct visual
characteristics of each platform. Using BGE-M3 (text) and EVA-CLIP (image), we
train three platform experts using a progressive two-stage, hard-negative
mining strategy to enhance discriminative power, and fuse their scores at
inference. The system tops the official leaderboard, demonstrating robust
cross-modal geo-localization under heterogeneous viewpoints.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出HyperET方法，利用双曲空间解决多模态大语言模型中视觉编码器与语言在多粒度级别对齐不足的问题，通过动态调整双曲半径实现高效训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs需要大量计算资源进行训练，主要原因是广泛使用的视觉编码器（如CLIP、SAM）缺乏与语言在多粒度级别的对齐。

Method: 利用双曲空间建模层次结构，通过动态双曲半径调整优化视觉表示与文本的对齐，采用可学习矩阵和Möbius乘法操作，提供三种参数化策略。

Result: 在多个MLLM基准测试中，HyperET仅增加不到1%的参数就能显著提升现有预训练和微调MLLMs的性能。

Conclusion: HyperET为多模态大语言模型提供了一种高效的多粒度对齐训练范式，显著降低了计算资源需求。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as a transformative
approach for aligning visual and textual understanding. They typically require
extremely high computational resources (e.g., thousands of GPUs) for training
to achieve cross-modal alignment at multi-granularity levels. We argue that a
key source of this inefficiency lies in the vision encoders they widely equip
with, e.g., CLIP and SAM, which lack the alignment with language at
multi-granularity levels. To address this issue, in this paper, we leverage
hyperbolic space, which inherently models hierarchical levels and thus provides
a principled framework for bridging the granularity gap between visual and
textual modalities at an arbitrary granularity level. Concretely, we propose an
efficient training paradigm for MLLMs, dubbed as HyperET, which can optimize
visual representations to align with their textual counterparts at an arbitrary
granularity level through dynamic hyperbolic radius adjustment in hyperbolic
space. HyperET employs learnable matrices with M\"{o}bius multiplication
operations, implemented via three effective configurations: diagonal scaling
matrices, block-diagonal matrices, and banded matrices, providing a flexible
yet efficient parametrization strategy. Comprehensive experiments across
multiple MLLM benchmarks demonstrate that HyperET consistently improves both
existing pre-training and fine-tuning MLLMs clearly with less than 1\%
additional parameters.

Motivation: 解决基于深度学习的点云几何压缩中泛化能力不足的问题，主要源于缺乏鲁棒的上下文模型和低效处理分布外数据。

Method: 1. 通用上下文模型：利用空间和通道分组先验捕获鲁棒上下文依赖；2. 实例自适应微调(IAFT)：结合显式和隐式压缩范式，为每个实例微调少量网络权重并纳入比特流。

Result: 在包含15个不同数据集的基准测试中，AnyPcc在点云压缩方面达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: AnyPcc通过通用上下文模型和实例自适应微调策略有效解决了点云压缩的泛化问题，代码和数据集将公开发布以促进可重复研究。

Abstract: Generalization remains a critical challenge for deep learning-based point
cloud geometry compression. We argue this stems from two key limitations: the
lack of robust context models and the inefficient handling of
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To address both, we introduce AnyPcc, a
universal point cloud compression framework. AnyPcc first employs a Universal
Context Model that leverages priors from both spatial and channel-wise grouping
to capture robust contextual dependencies. Second, our novel Instance-Adaptive
Fine-Tuning (IAFT) strategy tackles OOD data by synergizing explicit and
implicit compression paradigms. It fine-tunes a small subset of network weights
for each instance and incorporates them into the bitstream, where the marginal
bit cost of the weights is dwarfed by the resulting savings in geometry
compression. Extensive experiments on a benchmark of 15 diverse datasets
confirm that AnyPcc sets a new state-of-the-art in point cloud compression. Our
code and datasets will be released to encourage reproducible research.

TL;DR: AccuQuant是一种新颖的扩散模型后训练量化方法，通过模拟多步去噪过程来最小化量化误差累积，显著提升量化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在采样过程中，量化误差会随着去噪步骤的进行而累积，导致生成质量下降。现有方法独立处理每一步的误差，无法有效解决累积问题。

Method: AccuQuant在量化过程中显式模拟多个去噪步骤，考虑多步累积误差，并提出高效实现技术将内存复杂度从O(n)降至O(1)。

Result: 在多个任务和扩散模型的标准基准测试中，AccuQuant展现出优异的效能和效率。

Conclusion: AccuQuant通过解决量化误差累积问题，为扩散模型的高效量化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present in this paper a novel post-training quantization (PTQ) method,
dubbed AccuQuant, for diffusion models. We show analytically and empirically
that quantization errors for diffusion models are accumulated over denoising
steps in a sampling process. To alleviate the error accumulation problem,
AccuQuant minimizes the discrepancies between outputs of a full-precision
diffusion model and its quantized version within a couple of denoising steps.
That is, it simulates multiple denoising steps of a diffusion sampling process
explicitly for quantization, accounting the accumulated errors over multiple
denoising steps, which is in contrast to previous approaches to imitating a
training process of diffusion models, namely, minimizing the discrepancies
independently for each step. We also present an efficient implementation
technique for AccuQuant, together with a novel objective, which reduces a
memory complexity significantly from $\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$,
where $n$ is the number of denoising steps. We demonstrate the efficacy and
efficiency of AccuQuant across various tasks and diffusion models on standard
benchmarks.

Motivation: 研究发现DiTs中的补丁令牌表现出惊人的独立性，即使位置编码被扰动，DiTs仍能产生全局一致的输出，表明空间一致性主要由位置编码控制。这促使研究者重新思考如何更好地组织视觉内容。

Method: 提出了位置编码场(PE-Field)，将位置编码从2D平面扩展到结构化3D场。该方法包含用于体积推理的深度感知编码和用于细粒度子补丁控制的分层编码，使DiTs能够直接在3D空间中建模几何。

Conclusion: 通过将位置编码扩展到3D场，DiTs能够更有效地建模几何信息，在视觉生成任务中表现出色，为扩散变换器架构提供了新的组织方式。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the dominant architecture for
visual generation, powering state-of-the-art image and video models. By
representing images as patch tokens with positional encodings (PEs), DiTs
combine Transformer scalability with spatial and temporal inductive biases. In
this work, we revisit how DiTs organize visual content and discover that patch
tokens exhibit a surprising degree of independence: even when PEs are
perturbed, DiTs still produce globally coherent outputs, indicating that
spatial coherence is primarily governed by PEs. Motivated by this finding, we
introduce the Positional Encoding Field (PE-Field), which extends positional
encodings from the 2D plane to a structured 3D field. PE-Field incorporates
depth-aware encodings for volumetric reasoning and hierarchical encodings for
fine-grained sub-patch control, enabling DiTs to model geometry directly in 3D
space. Our PE-Field-augmented DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on
single-image novel view synthesis and generalizes to controllable spatial image
editing.

Abstract: This paper presents the FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet model, a novel approach for
lung cancer (LC) classification, leveraging dynamic fuzzy logic-driven
knowledge distillation (KD) to address uncertainty and complexity in disease
diagnosis. Unlike traditional models that rely on static KD with fixed weights,
our method dynamically adjusts the distillation weight using fuzzy logic,
enabling the student model to focus on high-confidence regions while reducing
attention to ambiguous areas. This dynamic adjustment improves the model
ability to handle varying uncertainty levels across different regions of LC
images. We employ the Vision Transformer (ViT-B32) as the instructor model,
which effectively transfers knowledge to the student model, MobileNet,
enhancing the student generalization capabilities. The training process is
further optimized using a dynamic wait adjustment mechanism that adapts the
training procedure for improved convergence and performance. To enhance image
quality, we introduce pixel-level image fusion improvement techniques such as
Gamma correction and Histogram Equalization. The processed images (Pix1 and
Pix2) are fused using a wavelet-based fusion method to improve image resolution
and feature preservation. This fusion method uses the wavedec2 function to
standardize images to a 224x224 resolution, decompose them into multi-scale
frequency components, and recursively average coefficients at each level for
better feature representation. To address computational efficiency, Genetic
Algorithm (GA) is used to select the most suitable pre-trained student model
from a pool of 12 candidates, balancing model performance with computational
cost. The model is evaluated on two datasets, including LC25000
histopathological images (99.16% accuracy) and IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan images
(99.54% accuracy), demonstrating robustness across different imaging domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于强化学习的方法依赖纯文本链式推理，容易产生无根据或幻觉结论；而帧检索方法虽然引入视觉基础，但在证据定位方面仍不准确。

Method: 构建了Conan-91K大规模自动生成推理轨迹数据集，包含帧识别、证据推理和行动决策；设计了多阶段渐进冷启动策略与识别-推理-行动强化学习训练框架。

Result: 在六个多步推理基准测试中，Conan平均比基线Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct准确率提升超过10%，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Conan不仅能有效提升多步视频推理性能，还能很好地泛化到长视频理解任务，展现出强大的可扩展性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Video reasoning, which requires multi-step deduction across frames, remains a
major challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While
reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods enhance reasoning capabilities, they
often rely on text-only chains that yield ungrounded or hallucinated
conclusions. Conversely, frame-retrieval approaches introduce visual grounding
but still struggle with inaccurate evidence localization. To address these
challenges, we present Conan, a framework for evidence-grounded multi-step
video reasoning. Conan identifies contextual and evidence frames, reasons over
cross-frame clues, and adaptively decides when to conclude or explore further.
To achieve this, we (1) construct Conan-91K, a large-scale dataset of
automatically generated reasoning traces that includes frame identification,
evidence reasoning, and action decision, and (2) design a multi-stage
progressive cold-start strategy combined with an
Identification-Reasoning-Action (AIR) RLVR training framework to jointly
enhance multi-step visual reasoning. Extensive experiments on six multi-step
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Conan surpasses the baseline
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by an average of over 10% in accuracy, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, Conan generalizes effectively to
long-video understanding tasks, validating its strong scalability and
robustness.

Abstract: Fairness evaluation in face analysis systems (FAS) typically depends on
automatic demographic attribute inference (DAI), which itself relies on
predefined demographic segmentation. However, the validity of fairness auditing
hinges on the reliability of the DAI process. We begin by providing a
theoretical motivation for this dependency, showing that improved DAI
reliability leads to less biased and lower-variance estimates of FAS fairness.
To address this, we propose a fully reproducible DAI pipeline that replaces
conventional end-to-end training with a modular transfer learning approach. Our
design integrates pretrained face recognition encoders with non-linear
classification heads. We audit this pipeline across three dimensions: accuracy,
fairness, and a newly introduced notion of robustness, defined via
intra-identity consistency. The proposed robustness metric is applicable to any
demographic segmentation scheme. We benchmark the pipeline on gender and
ethnicity inference across multiple datasets and training setups. Our results
show that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines, particularly on
ethnicity, which is the more challenging attribute. To promote transparency and
reproducibility, we will publicly release the training dataset metadata, full
codebase, pretrained models, and evaluation toolkit. This work contributes a
reliable foundation for demographic inference in fairness auditing.

*Yixiong Yang,Tao Wu,Senmao Li,Shiqi Yang,Yaxing Wang,Joost van de Weijer,Kai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了EchoDistill双向概念蒸馏框架，实现一步扩散个性化(1-SDP)，通过师生模型协同训练提升单步模型的概念个性化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单步扩散模型在捕捉新概念分布方面能力有限，难以有效实现文本到图像模型的个性化。

Method: 采用端到端训练，多步模型(教师)和单步模型(学生)同时训练，通过双向概念蒸馏和回声反馈机制共享文本编码器，结合对抗损失和对齐损失优化学生模型。

Result: 实验表明该协作框架在1-SDP设置下显著优于现有个性化方法，不仅提升了学生模型的概念个性化能力，还改善了教师模型的生成质量。

Conclusion: 建立了一种快速有效的T2I扩散模型个性化新范式，通过双向概念蒸馏机制实现了高效的概念传递和模型优化。

Abstract: Recent advances in accelerating text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have
enabled the synthesis of high-fidelity images even in a single step. However,
personalizing these models to incorporate novel concepts remains a challenge
due to the limited capacity of one-step models to capture new concept
distributions effectively. We propose a bidirectional concept distillation
framework, EchoDistill, to enable one-step diffusion personalization (1-SDP).
Our approach involves an end-to-end training process where a multi-step
diffusion model (teacher) and a one-step diffusion model (student) are trained
simultaneously. The concept is first distilled from the teacher model to the
student, and then echoed back from the student to the teacher. During the
EchoDistill, we share the text encoder between the two models to ensure
consistent semantic understanding. Following this, the student model is
optimized with adversarial losses to align with the real image distribution and
with alignment losses to maintain consistency with the teacher's output.
Furthermore, we introduce the bidirectional echoing refinement strategy,
wherein the student model leverages its faster generation capability to
feedback to the teacher model. This bidirectional concept distillation
mechanism not only enhances the student ability to personalize novel concepts
but also improves the generative quality of the teacher model. Our experiments
demonstrate that this collaborative framework significantly outperforms
existing personalization methods over the 1-SDP setup, establishing a novel
paradigm for rapid and effective personalization in T2I diffusion models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Metis-HOME是一个混合优化的专家混合框架，通过将密集模型分为思考分支和非思考分支来解决多模态推理模型在效率与泛化能力之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大推理模型存在两个关键局限：对简单查询也使用计算昂贵的推理导致效率低下，以及专注于专业推理损害了更广泛的通用理解能力。

Method: 将原始密集模型结构化为两个专家分支：用于复杂多步推理的思考分支和用于快速直接推理的非思考分支，通过轻量级可训练路由器动态分配查询。

Result: 该方法不仅显著增强了复杂推理能力，还改善了模型的通用能力，逆转了其他推理专用模型中观察到的退化趋势。

Conclusion: 这项工作为构建强大且通用的多模态大语言模型建立了新范式，有效解决了普遍存在的推理与泛化之间的困境。

Abstract: Inspired by recent advancements in LLM reasoning, the field of multimodal
reasoning has seen remarkable progress, achieving significant performance gains
on intricate tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Despite this progress,
current multimodal large reasoning models exhibit two key limitations. They
tend to employ computationally expensive reasoning even for simple queries,
leading to inefficiency. Furthermore, this focus on specialized reasoning often
impairs their broader, more general understanding capabilities. In this paper,
we propose Metis-HOME: a Hybrid Optimized Mixture-of-Experts framework designed
to address this trade-off. Metis-HOME enables a ''Hybrid Thinking'' paradigm by
structuring the original dense model into two distinct expert branches: a
thinking branch tailored for complex, multi-step reasoning, and a non-thinking
branch optimized for rapid, direct inference on tasks like general VQA and OCR.
A lightweight, trainable router dynamically allocates queries to the most
suitable expert. We instantiate Metis-HOME by adapting the Qwen2.5-VL-7B into
an MoE architecture. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that our approach not
only substantially enhances complex reasoning abilities but also improves the
model's general capabilities, reversing the degradation trend observed in other
reasoning-specialized models. Our work establishes a new paradigm for building
powerful and versatile MLLMs, effectively resolving the prevalent
reasoning-vs-generalization dilemma.

TL;DR: 提出了Fake-in-Facext (FiFa)框架，通过细粒度的面部区域概念划分和新的伪影定位解释任务，解决了现有可解释深度伪造分析方法缺乏细粒度感知的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的多模态大语言模型在可解释深度伪造分析中存在细粒度感知不足的问题：数据标注不可靠且粗粒度，模型无法输出文本伪造解释与视觉伪影证据之间的连接，也不支持任意面部区域的查询输入。

Method: 首先定义面部图像概念树(FICT)对面部图像进行细粒度区域划分，建立FiFa-Annotator数据标注流程；提出伪影定位解释(AGE)任务，生成包含分割掩码的文本伪造解释；设计统一的多任务学习架构FiFa-MLLM，同时支持丰富的多模态输入输出。

Result: FiFa-MLLM在AGE任务上优于强基线方法，在现有XDFA数据集上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: FiFa框架通过细粒度的数据标注和模型架构设计，有效提升了可解释深度伪造分析的性能，解决了现有方法在面部视觉上下文中的不足。

Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has bridged the
gap between vision and language tasks, enabling the implementation of
Explainable DeepFake Analysis (XDFA). However, current methods suffer from a
lack of fine-grained awareness: the description of artifacts in data annotation
is unreliable and coarse-grained, and the models fail to support the output of
connections between textual forgery explanations and the visual evidence of
artifacts, as well as the input of queries for arbitrary facial regions. As a
result, their responses are not sufficiently grounded in Face Visual Context
(Facext). To address this limitation, we propose the Fake-in-Facext (FiFa)
framework, with contributions focusing on data annotation and model
construction. We first define a Facial Image Concept Tree (FICT) to divide
facial images into fine-grained regional concepts, thereby obtaining a more
reliable data annotation pipeline, FiFa-Annotator, for forgery explanation.
Based on this dedicated data annotation, we introduce a novel
Artifact-Grounding Explanation (AGE) task, which generates textual forgery
explanations interleaved with segmentation masks of manipulated artifacts. We
propose a unified multi-task learning architecture, FiFa-MLLM, to
simultaneously support abundant multimodal inputs and outputs for fine-grained
Explainable DeepFake Analysis. With multiple auxiliary supervision tasks,
FiFa-MLLM can outperform strong baselines on the AGE task and achieve SOTA
performance on existing XDFA datasets. The code and data will be made
open-source at https://github.com/lxq1000/Fake-in-Facext.

Motivation: 相机抖动导致的大范围或旋转运动模糊仍然是图像恢复中的主要挑战，现有端到端去模糊网络在严重模糊情况下表现不佳。

Method: 使用可微分模糊创建模块实现投影运动模糊模型，神经网络预测完整3D旋转轨迹，指导基于模型的端到端恢复网络，并通过重模糊损失优化轨迹。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上实现最先进的性能，特别是在严重或空间变化模糊情况下表现优异。

Conclusion: 该模块化架构提供了可解释性，能够重建生成模糊图像的清晰图像序列，在挑战性模糊场景中优于端到端方法。

Abstract: Motion blur caused by camera shake, particularly under large or rotational
movements, remains a major challenge in image restoration. We propose a deep
learning framework that jointly estimates the latent sharp image and the
underlying camera motion trajectory from a single blurry image. Our method
leverages the Projective Motion Blur Model (PMBM), implemented efficiently
using a differentiable blur creation module compatible with modern networks. A
neural network predicts a full 3D rotation trajectory, which guides a
model-based restoration network trained end-to-end. This modular architecture
provides interpretability by revealing the camera motion that produced the
blur. Moreover, this trajectory enables the reconstruction of the sequence of
sharp images that generated the observed blurry image. To further refine
results, we optimize the trajectory post-inference via a reblur loss, improving
consistency between the blurry input and the restored output. Extensive
experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
synthetic and real datasets, particularly in cases with severe or spatially
variant blur, where end-to-end deblurring networks struggle.

Motivation: 消费级相机系统在复杂光照条件下（如低光、高动态范围、背光）难以保持稳定的图像质量，导致曝光不足、色偏和色调不一致，影响下游视觉任务性能。

Method: 提出ACamera-Net框架，包含两个模块：ACamera-Exposure估计ISO缓解曝光不足和对比度损失，ACamera-Color预测相关色温和增益因子改善色彩一致性。针对边缘设备实时推理优化，可无缝集成到成像管道中。

Result: 在多样化真实世界数据上训练，模型在不同光照条件下泛化良好。大量实验表明ACamera-Net持续提升图像质量并稳定感知输出，优于传统自动模式和轻量级基线方法，且不依赖额外图像增强模块。

Conclusion: ACamera-Net有效解决了复杂光照条件下的图像质量问题，通过直接预测相机参数实现了稳定且高质量的图像输出，适用于边缘设备实时应用。

Abstract: Consumer-grade camera systems often struggle to maintain stable image quality
under complex illumination conditions such as low light, high dynamic range,
and backlighting, as well as spatial color temperature variation. These issues
lead to underexposure, color casts, and tonal inconsistency, which degrade the
performance of downstream vision tasks. To address this, we propose
ACamera-Net, a lightweight and scene-adaptive camera parameter adjustment
network that directly predicts optimal exposure and white balance from RAW
inputs. The framework consists of two modules: ACamera-Exposure, which
estimates ISO to alleviate underexposure and contrast loss, and ACamera-Color,
which predicts correlated color temperature and gain factors for improved color
consistency. Optimized for real-time inference on edge devices, ACamera-Net can
be seamlessly integrated into imaging pipelines. Trained on diverse real-world
data with annotated references, the model generalizes well across lighting
conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACamera-Net consistently
enhances image quality and stabilizes perception outputs, outperforming
conventional auto modes and lightweight baselines without relying on additional
image enhancement modules.

Abstract: The realization of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) necessitates
Embodied AI agents capable of robust spatial perception, effective task
planning, and adaptive execution in physical environments. However, current
large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for embodied tasks
suffer from key limitations, including a significant gap between model design
and agent requirements, an unavoidable trade-off between real-time latency and
performance, and the use of unauthentic, offline evaluation metrics. To address
these challenges, we propose EmbodiedBrain, a novel vision-language foundation
model available in both 7B and 32B parameter sizes. Our framework features an
agent-aligned data structure and employs a powerful training methodology that
integrates large-scale Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Step-Augumented Group
Relative Policy Optimization (Step-GRPO), which boosts long-horizon task
success by integrating preceding steps as Guided Precursors. Furthermore, we
incorporate a comprehensive reward system, including a Generative Reward Model
(GRM) accelerated at the infrastructure level, to improve training efficiency.
For enable thorough validation, we establish a three-part evaluation system
encompassing General, Planning, and End-to-End Simulation Benchmarks,
highlighted by the proposal and open-sourcing of a novel, challenging
simulation environment. Experimental results demonstrate that EmbodiedBrain
achieves superior performance across all metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for embodied foundation models. Towards paving the way for the
next generation of generalist embodied agents, we open-source all of our data,
model weight, and evaluating methods, which are available at

Abstract: Recent years have seen impressive advances in text-to-image generation, with
image generative or unified models producing high-quality images from text. Yet
these models still struggle with fine-grained color controllability, often
failing to accurately match colors specified in text prompts. While existing
benchmarks evaluate compositional reasoning and prompt adherence, none
systematically assess color precision. Color is fundamental to human visual
perception and communication, critical for applications from art to design
workflows requiring brand consistency. However, current benchmarks either
neglect color or rely on coarse assessments, missing key capabilities such as
interpreting RGB values or aligning with human expectations. To this end, we
propose GenColorBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for text-to-image
color generation, grounded in color systems like ISCC-NBS and CSS3/X11,
including numerical colors which are absent elsewhere. With 44K color-focused
prompts covering 400+ colors, it reveals models' true capabilities via
perceptual and automated assessments. Evaluations of popular text-to-image
models using GenColorBench show performance variations, highlighting which
color conventions models understand best and identifying failure modes. Our
GenColorBench assessments will guide improvements in precise color generation.
The benchmark will be made public upon acceptance.

Conclusion: 提出的基于相似性原型的框架在跨模态分割任务中表现出色，通过原型学习和对比学习有效解决了领域适应问题。

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved great success on various vision
challenges, but a well-trained model would face drastic performance degradation
when applied to unseen data. Since the model is sensitive to domain shift,
unsupervised domain adaptation attempts to reduce the domain gap and avoid
costly annotation of unseen domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for
cross-modality segmentation via similarity-based prototypes. In specific, we
learn class-wise prototypes within an embedding space, then introduce a
similarity constraint to make these prototypes representative for each semantic
class while separable from different classes. Moreover, we use dictionaries to
store prototypes extracted from different images, which prevents the
class-missing problem and enables the contrastive learning of prototypes, and
further improves performance. Extensive experiments show that our method
achieves better results than other state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理自由移动物体的重建，提供全面而紧凑的物体覆盖，计算成本与视频序列长度无关。

Abstract: Free-moving object reconstruction from monocular video remains challenging,
particularly without reliable pose or depth cues and under arbitrary object
motion. We introduce OnlineSplatter, a novel online feed-forward framework
generating high-quality, object-centric 3D Gaussians directly from RGB frames
without requiring camera pose, depth priors, or bundle optimization. Our
approach anchors reconstruction using the first frame and progressively refines
the object representation through a dense Gaussian primitive field, maintaining
constant computational cost regardless of video sequence length. Our core
contribution is a dual-key memory module combining latent appearance-geometry
keys with explicit directional keys, robustly fusing current frame features
with temporally aggregated object states. This design enables effective
handling of free-moving objects via spatial-guided memory readout and an
efficient sparsification mechanism, ensuring comprehensive yet compact object
coverage. Evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that OnlineSplatter
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art pose-free reconstruction baselines,
consistently improving with more observations while maintaining constant memory

Result: 在长视频理解基准测试中，SeViCES在准确性和鲁棒性方面持续优于最先进方法

Conclusion: 共识驱动的证据选择对视频大语言模型至关重要

Abstract: Long video understanding remains challenging due to its complex, diverse, and
temporally scattered content. Although video large language models (Video-LLMs)
can process videos lasting tens of minutes, applying them to truly long
sequences is computationally prohibitive and often leads to unfocused or
inconsistent reasoning. A promising solution is to select only the most
informative frames, yet existing approaches typically ignore temporal
dependencies or rely on unimodal evidence, limiting their ability to provide
complete and query-relevant context. We propose a Semantic-Visual Consensus
Evidence Selection (SeViCES) framework for effective and reliable long video
understanding. SeViCES is training-free and model-agnostic, and introduces two
key components. The Semantic-Visual Consensus Frame Selection (SVCFS) module
selects frames through (1) a temporal-aware semantic branch that leverages LLM
reasoning over captions, and (2) a cluster-guided visual branch that aligns
embeddings with semantic scores via mutual information. The Answer Consensus
Refinement (ACR) module further resolves inconsistencies between semantic- and
visual-based predictions by fusing evidence and constraining the answer space.
Extensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks show that SeViCES
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and
robustness, demonstrating the importance of consensus-driven evidence selection
for Video-LLMs.

Abstract: Efficient analysis and processing of dental images are crucial for dentists
to achieve accurate diagnosis and optimal treatment planning. However, dental
imaging inherently poses several challenges, such as low contrast, metallic
artifacts, and variations in projection angles. Combined with the subjectivity
arising from differences in clinicians' expertise, manual interpretation often
proves time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. Artificial intelligence
(AI)-based automated dental image analysis (DIA) offers a promising solution to
these issues and has become an integral part of computer-aided dental diagnosis
and treatment. Among various AI technologies, deep learning (DL) stands out as
the most widely applied and influential approach due to its superior feature
extraction and representation capabilities. To comprehensively summarize recent
progress in this field, we focus on the two fundamental aspects of DL
research-datasets and models. In this paper, we systematically review 260
studies on DL applications in DIA, including 49 papers on publicly available
dental datasets and 211 papers on DL-based algorithms. We first introduce the
basic concepts of dental imaging and summarize the characteristics and
acquisition methods of existing datasets. Then, we present the foundational
techniques of DL and categorize relevant models and algorithms according to
different DIA tasks, analyzing their network architectures, optimization
strategies, training methods, and performance. Furthermore, we summarize
commonly used training and evaluation metrics in the DIA domain. Finally, we
discuss the current challenges of existing research and outline potential
future directions. We hope that this work provides a valuable and systematic
reference for researchers in this field. All supplementary materials and
detailed comparison tables will be made publicly available on GitHub.

TL;DR: BTB3D是一种因果卷积编码器-解码器，通过频率感知的3D token化方法，在3D医学影像的视觉语言建模中实现了更好的报告生成和文本到CT合成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在处理高分辨率、长序列3D医学影像时存在困难：对比预训练导致视觉编码器与临床语言不对齐，切片级token化模糊了精细解剖结构，降低了诊断性能。

Method: 提出BTB3D，采用因果卷积编码器-解码器架构，通过三阶段训练课程：(i)局部重建，(ii)重叠窗口平铺，(iii)长上下文解码器精炼，从短切片片段学习并泛化到超过300切片的扫描。

Result: 在报告生成任务中，BLEU分数提升，临床F1比CT2Rep、CT-CHAT和Merlin提高40%；在文本到CT合成中，FID降低75%，FVD减半，生成512*512*241的解剖一致体积。

Conclusion: 精确的三维token化（而非仅使用更大的语言骨干）对于3D医学影像中可扩展的视觉语言建模至关重要。

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language modeling for 3D medical imaging has been
fueled by large-scale computed tomography (CT) corpora with paired free-text
reports, stronger architectures, and powerful pretrained models. This has
enabled applications such as automated report generation and text-conditioned
3D image synthesis. Yet, current approaches struggle with high-resolution,
long-sequence volumes: contrastive pretraining often yields vision encoders
that are misaligned with clinical language, and slice-wise tokenization blurs
fine anatomy, reducing diagnostic performance on downstream tasks. We introduce
BTB3D (Better Tokens for Better 3D), a causal convolutional encoder-decoder
that unifies 2D and 3D training and inference while producing compact,
frequency-aware volumetric tokens. A three-stage training curriculum enables
(i) local reconstruction, (ii) overlapping-window tiling, and (iii)
long-context decoder refinement, during which the model learns from short slice
excerpts yet generalizes to scans exceeding 300 slices without additional
memory overhead. BTB3D sets a new state-of-the-art on two key tasks: it
improves BLEU scores and increases clinical F1 by 40% over CT2Rep, CT-CHAT, and
Merlin for report generation; and it reduces FID by 75% and halves FVD compared
to GenerateCT and MedSyn for text-to-CT synthesis, producing anatomically
consistent 512*512*241 volumes. These results confirm that precise
three-dimensional tokenization, rather than larger language backbones alone, is
essential for scalable vision-language modeling in 3D medical imaging. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了UltraHR-100K超高清文本到图像数据集和频率感知后训练方法，解决超高清图像生成中数据集缺失和细节合成训练策略不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超高清文本到图像生成面临两大挑战：缺乏大规模高质量超高清数据集，以及缺乏针对超高清场景下细粒度细节合成的专门训练策略。

Method: 1）构建UltraHR-100K数据集，包含10万张分辨率超过3K的高质量图像；2）提出频率感知后训练方法，包括细节导向时间步采样（DOTS）和软加权频率正则化（SWFR）。

Result: 在提出的UltraHR-eval4K基准测试上，该方法显著提升了超高清图像生成的细粒度细节质量和整体保真度。

Conclusion: 通过高质量数据集和专门的训练策略，成功解决了超高清文本到图像生成中的关键挑战，显著提升了细节生成质量。

Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution (UHR) text-to-image (T2I) generation has seen notable
progress. However, two key challenges remain : 1) the absence of a large-scale
high-quality UHR T2I dataset, and (2) the neglect of tailored training
strategies for fine-grained detail synthesis in UHR scenarios. To tackle the
first challenge, we introduce \textbf{UltraHR-100K}, a high-quality dataset of
100K UHR images with rich captions, offering diverse content and strong visual
fidelity. Each image exceeds 3K resolution and is rigorously curated based on
detail richness, content complexity, and aesthetic quality. To tackle the
second challenge, we propose a frequency-aware post-training method that
enhances fine-detail generation in T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we
design (i) \textit{Detail-Oriented Timestep Sampling (DOTS)} to focus learning
on detail-critical denoising steps, and (ii) \textit{Soft-Weighting Frequency
Regularization (SWFR)}, which leverages Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to
softly constrain frequency components, encouraging high-frequency detail
preservation. Extensive experiments on our proposed UltraHR-eval4K benchmarks
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the fine-grained detail
quality and overall fidelity of UHR image generation. The code is available at

Motivation: 准确的垃圾分类对可持续废物管理至关重要，错误分类会导致垃圾填埋场堆积、回收效率低下和温室气体排放增加。

Method: 使用预训练的ResNet-152提取深度空间特征，然后通过可微分软自组织映射增强拓扑聚类和可解释性，最后用脉冲神经网络头在离散时间步上累积时序激活。

Abstract: Accurate waste classification is vital for achieving sustainable waste
management and reducing the environmental footprint of urbanization.
Misclassification of recyclable materials contributes to landfill accumulation,
inefficient recycling, and increased greenhouse gas emissions. To address these
issues, this study introduces HybridSOMSpikeNet, a hybrid deep learning
framework that integrates convolutional feature extraction, differentiable
self-organization, and spiking-inspired temporal processing to enable
intelligent and energy-efficient waste classification. The proposed model
employs a pre-trained ResNet-152 backbone to extract deep spatial
representations, followed by a Differentiable Soft Self-Organizing Map
(Soft-SOM) that enhances topological clustering and interpretability. A spiking
neural head accumulates temporal activations over discrete time steps,
improving robustness and generalization. Trained on a ten-class waste dataset,
HybridSOMSpikeNet achieved a test accuracy of 97.39%, outperforming several
state-of-the-art architectures while maintaining a lightweight computational
profile suitable for real-world deployment. Beyond its technical innovations,
the framework provides tangible environmental benefits. By enabling precise and
automated waste segregation, it supports higher recycling efficiency, reduces
contamination in recyclable streams, and minimizes the ecological and
operational costs of waste processing. The approach aligns with global
sustainability priorities, particularly the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals (SDG 11 and SDG 12), by contributing to cleaner cities,
circular economy initiatives, and intelligent environmental management systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出两种技术来显著减少多比特量化网络的训练开销：权重偏置校正和按比特核心集采样策略，在保持模型性能的同时将训练时间减少最多7.88倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多比特量化网络方法存在显著训练开销问题，因为需要为每个支持的比特宽度重复完整数据集更新，且通常需要额外的微调阶段来支持更多精度选项。

Method: 1. 权重偏置校正：通过中和跨比特宽度的量化诱导偏置并对齐激活分布，实现共享批归一化并消除微调需求；2. 按比特核心集采样策略：利用隐式知识转移现象，通过基于梯度的重要性分数为每个子模型选择紧凑的信息子集进行训练。

Result: 在CIFAR-10/100、TinyImageNet和ImageNet-1K数据集上，使用ResNet和ViT架构的实验表明，该方法在实现竞争性或更优准确率的同时，将训练时间减少最多7.88倍。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法显著降低了多比特量化网络的训练开销，同时保持了模型性能，为灵活部署深度神经网络提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-bit quantization networks enable flexible deployment of deep neural
networks by supporting multiple precision levels within a single model.
However, existing approaches suffer from significant training overhead as
full-dataset updates are repeated for each supported bit-width, resulting in a
cost that scales linearly with the number of precisions. Additionally, extra
fine-tuning stages are often required to support additional or intermediate
precision options, further compounding the overall training burden. To address
this issue, we propose two techniques that greatly reduce the training overhead
without compromising model utility: (i) Weight bias correction enables shared
batch normalization and eliminates the need for fine-tuning by neutralizing
quantization-induced bias across bit-widths and aligning activation
distributions; and (ii) Bit-wise coreset sampling strategy allows each child
model to train on a compact, informative subset selected via gradient-based
importance scores by exploiting the implicit knowledge transfer phenomenon.
Experiments on CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-1K with both ResNet and
ViT architectures demonstrate that our method achieves competitive or superior
accuracy while reducing training time up to 7.88x. Our code is released at
https://github.com/a2jinhee/EMQNet_jk.

Conclusion: 未来视觉推理模型应专注于整合更广泛的专用视觉分析工具，作者将发布框架和评估套件以促进研究。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that integrate visual and textual
reasoning leverage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to tackle complex visual
tasks, yet continue to exhibit visual hallucinations and an over-reliance on
textual priors. We present a systematic diagnosis of state-of-the-art
vision-language models using a three-stage evaluation framework, uncovering key
failure modes. To address these, we propose an agent-based architecture that
combines LLM reasoning with lightweight visual modules, enabling fine-grained
analysis and iterative refinement of reasoning chains. Our results highlight
future visual reasoning models should focus on integrating a broader set of
specialized tools for analyzing visual content. Our system achieves significant
gains (+10.3 on MMMU, +6.0 on MathVista over a 7B baseline), matching or
surpassing much larger models. We will release our framework and evaluation

*Xuyang Liu,Xiyan Gui,Yuchao Zhang,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MixKV是一种新颖的KV缓存压缩方法，通过混合重要性和多样性来优化大型视觉语言模型中的KV缓存压缩，在极端压缩条件下显著提升多模态理解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法主要关注保留高重要性KV对以最小化存储，但忽视了多模态KV缓存中出现的模态特定语义冗余模式，这限制了部署可扩展性。

Method: MixKV方法分析KV缓存在不同注意力头中的冗余程度，自适应地平衡多样性和重要性来压缩KV对，而不是仅仅依赖重要性。

Result: 在极端压缩条件下（预算=64），MixKV将基线方法平均提升5.1%，在GUI接地任务上对SnapKV和AdaKV分别实现8.0%和9.0%的显著增益，同时保持相当的推理效率。

Conclusion: MixKV通过混合重要性和多样性有效解决了多模态KV缓存压缩问题，在保持效率的同时显著提升性能，并可无缝扩展到LLMs中。

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in processing extended multi-modal sequences, yet the resulting
key-value (KV) cache expansion creates a critical memory bottleneck that
fundamentally limits deployment scalability. While existing KV cache
compression methods focus on retaining high-importance KV pairs to minimize
storage, they often overlook the modality-specific semantic redundancy patterns
that emerge distinctively in multi-modal KV caches. In this work, we first
analyze how, beyond simple importance, the KV cache in LVLMs exhibits varying
levels of redundancy across attention heads. We show that relying solely on
importance can only cover a subset of the full KV cache information
distribution, leading to potential loss of semantic coverage. To address this,
we propose \texttt{MixKV}, a novel method that mixes importance with diversity
for optimized KV cache compression in LVLMs. \texttt{MixKV} adapts to head-wise
semantic redundancy, selectively balancing diversity and importance when
compressing KV pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{MixKV}
consistently enhances existing methods across multiple LVLMs. Under extreme
compression (budget=64), \texttt{MixKV} improves baseline methods by an average
of \textbf{5.1\%} across five multi-modal understanding benchmarks and achieves
remarkable gains of \textbf{8.0\%} and \textbf{9.0\%} for SnapKV and AdaKV on
GUI grounding tasks, all while maintaining comparable inference efficiency.
Furthermore, \texttt{MixKV} extends seamlessly to LLMs with comparable
performance gains. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统激光雷达投影方法存在几何不一致性，导致不可逆的信息损失，影响高保真应用。需要一种无需制造商数据的通用无损投影方法。

Method: 通过自动逆向工程推断激光雷达传感器的关键参数，包括激光束配置、角度分布和每束激光的校准校正，实现无损投影和完整点云重建。

Result: 在KITTI和DurLAR数据集上的全面评估显示，ALICE-LRI实现了完美的点保留，所有点云中零点损失，几何精度保持在传感器精度限制内，具有实时性能。

Conclusion: 从近似到无损激光雷达投影的范式转变，为需要完整几何保留的高精度遥感应用开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: 3D LiDAR sensors are essential for autonomous navigation, environmental
monitoring, and precision mapping in remote sensing applications. To
efficiently process the massive point clouds generated by these sensors, LiDAR
data is often projected into 2D range images that organize points by their
angular positions and distances. While these range image representations enable
efficient processing, conventional projection methods suffer from fundamental
geometric inconsistencies that cause irreversible information loss,
compromising high-fidelity applications. We present ALICE-LRI (Automatic LiDAR
Intrinsic Calibration Estimation for Lossless Range Images), the first general,
sensor-agnostic method that achieves lossless range image generation from
spinning LiDAR point clouds without requiring manufacturer metadata or
calibration files. Our algorithm automatically reverse-engineers the intrinsic
geometry of any spinning LiDAR sensor by inferring critical parameters
including laser beam configuration, angular distributions, and per-beam
calibration corrections, enabling lossless projection and complete point cloud
reconstruction with zero point loss. Comprehensive evaluation across the
complete KITTI and DurLAR datasets demonstrates that ALICE-LRI achieves perfect
point preservation, with zero points lost across all point clouds. Geometric
accuracy is maintained well within sensor precision limits, establishing
geometric losslessness with real-time performance. We also present a
compression case study that validates substantial downstream benefits,
demonstrating significant quality improvements in practical applications. This
paradigm shift from approximate to lossless LiDAR projections opens new
possibilities for high-precision remote sensing applications requiring complete
geometric preservation.

Conclusion: AutoScape通过几何一致的关键帧生成和插值策略，有效解决了长时域驾驶场景生成中的几何一致性问题，显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: This paper proposes AutoScape, a long-horizon driving scene generation
framework. At its core is a novel RGB-D diffusion model that iteratively
generates sparse, geometrically consistent keyframes, serving as reliable
anchors for the scene's appearance and geometry. To maintain long-range
geometric consistency, the model 1) jointly handles image and depth in a shared
latent space, 2) explicitly conditions on the existing scene geometry (i.e.,
rendered point clouds) from previously generated keyframes, and 3) steers the
sampling process with a warp-consistent guidance. Given high-quality RGB-D
keyframes, a video diffusion model then interpolates between them to produce
dense and coherent video frames. AutoScape generates realistic and
geometrically consistent driving videos of over 20 seconds, improving the
long-horizon FID and FVD scores over the prior state-of-the-art by 48.6\% and
43.0\%, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器模型在高分辨率图像生成时面临自注意力机制二次方计算复杂度的挑战，训练成本极高。

Method: 利用扩散过程中的频谱特性，在每一步扩散过程中动态调整位置编码，使其频谱与当前生成阶段匹配。

Result: 能够生成高达1600万像素的超高分辨率图像，在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的保真度，且分辨率越高性能提升越明显。

Conclusion: DyPE提供了一种高效的无训练方法，显著扩展了预训练扩散模型的分辨率生成能力。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer models can generate images with remarkable fidelity and
detail, yet training them at ultra-high resolutions remains extremely costly
due to the self-attention mechanism's quadratic scaling with the number of
image tokens. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Position Extrapolation
(DyPE), a novel, training-free method that enables pre-trained diffusion
transformers to synthesize images at resolutions far beyond their training
data, with no additional sampling cost. DyPE takes advantage of the spectral
progression inherent to the diffusion process, where low-frequency structures
converge early, while high-frequencies take more steps to resolve.
Specifically, DyPE dynamically adjusts the model's positional encoding at each
diffusion step, matching their frequency spectrum with the current stage of the
generative process. This approach allows us to generate images at resolutions
that exceed the training resolution dramatically, e.g., 16 million pixels using
FLUX. On multiple benchmarks, DyPE consistently improves performance and
achieves state-of-the-art fidelity in ultra-high-resolution image generation,
with gains becoming even more pronounced at higher resolutions. Project page is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现MeanFlow目标自然分解为轨迹流匹配和轨迹一致性两个部分，这两个项存在强烈的负相关性，导致优化冲突和收敛缓慢。

Method: 提出α-Flow目标家族，统一了轨迹流匹配、Shortcut Model和MeanFlow，采用课程策略平滑地从轨迹流匹配过渡到MeanFlow。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K 256x256上，α-Flow始终优于MeanFlow，最大模型α-Flow-XL/2+使用普通DiT主干取得了FID 2.58(1步)和2.15(2步)的最新SOTA结果。

Conclusion: α-Flow成功解决了MeanFlow中的优化冲突问题，通过课程学习策略实现了更好的收敛性能和生成质量。

Abstract: MeanFlow has recently emerged as a powerful framework for few-step generative
modeling trained from scratch, but its success is not yet fully understood. In
this work, we show that the MeanFlow objective naturally decomposes into two
parts: trajectory flow matching and trajectory consistency. Through gradient
analysis, we find that these terms are strongly negatively correlated, causing
optimization conflict and slow convergence. Motivated by these insights, we
introduce $\alpha$-Flow, a broad family of objectives that unifies trajectory
flow matching, Shortcut Model, and MeanFlow under one formulation. By adopting
a curriculum strategy that smoothly anneals from trajectory flow matching to
MeanFlow, $\alpha$-Flow disentangles the conflicting objectives, and achieves
better convergence. When trained from scratch on class-conditional ImageNet-1K
256x256 with vanilla DiT backbones, $\alpha$-Flow consistently outperforms
MeanFlow across scales and settings. Our largest $\alpha$-Flow-XL/2+ model
achieves new state-of-the-art results using vanilla DiT backbones, with FID
scores of 2.58 (1-NFE) and 2.15 (2-NFE).

Motivation: 解决从单张2D图像进行3D重建的挑战，特别是在姿态估计和形状恢复方面，传统方法往往难以同时达到高精度。

Method: 将3D重建建模为条件采样过程，采用两阶段流匹配：粗阶段生成初始3D几何和2D投影用于姿态恢复；精阶段集成姿态对齐的图像特征以增强结构保真度和外观细节。

Result: 在广泛实验中，Cupid在PSNR上获得超过3dB的提升，Chamfer距离减少超过10%，在姿态精度上匹配单目估计器，在视觉保真度上优于基线3D生成模型。

Conclusion: Cupid通过统一的生成框架实现了从单张图像的高质量3D重建，在姿态估计、形状恢复和视觉质量方面均表现出色。

Abstract: This work proposes a new generation-based 3D reconstruction method, named
Cupid, that accurately infers the camera pose, 3D shape, and texture of an
object from a single 2D image. Cupid casts 3D reconstruction as a conditional
sampling process from a learned distribution of 3D objects, and it jointly
generates voxels and pixel-voxel correspondences, enabling robust pose and
shape estimation under a unified generative framework. By representing both
input camera poses and 3D shape as a distribution in a shared 3D latent space,
Cupid adopts a two-stage flow matching pipeline: (1) a coarse stage that
produces initial 3D geometry with associated 2D projections for pose recovery;
and (2) a refinement stage that integrates pose-aligned image features to
enhance structural fidelity and appearance details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate Cupid outperforms leading 3D reconstruction methods with an over 3
dB PSNR gain and an over 10% Chamfer Distance reduction, while matching
monocular estimators on pose accuracy and delivering superior visual fidelity
over baseline 3D generative models. For an immersive view of the 3D results

Conclusion: 这是首个研究雷达-摄像头共同特征集成及其在在线校准中应用以实现多目标跟踪的工作，证明了该方法的有效性

Abstract: This paper presents a Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) framework that fuses radar
and camera data to enhance tracking efficiency while minimizing manual
interventions. Contrary to many studies that underutilize radar and assign it a
supplementary role--despite its capability to provide accurate range/depth
information of targets in a world 3D coordinate system--our approach positions
radar in a crucial role. Meanwhile, this paper utilizes common features to
enable online calibration to autonomously associate detections from radar and
camera. The main contributions of this work include: (1) the development of a
radar-camera fusion MOT framework that exploits online radar-camera calibration
to simplify the integration of detection results from these two sensors, (2)
the utilization of common features between radar and camera data to accurately
derive real-world positions of detected objects, and (3) the adoption of
feature matching and category-consistency checking to surpass the limitations
of mere position matching in enhancing sensor association accuracy. To the best
of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the integration of
radar-camera common features and their use in online calibration for achieving
MOT. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated by its ability to streamline
the radar-camera mapping process and improve tracking precision, as evidenced
by real-world experiments conducted in both controlled environments and actual
traffic scenarios. Code is available at

TL;DR: ARGenSeg是一种基于自回归生成的图像分割新范式，通过统一框架实现多模态理解和像素级感知，利用图像生成方法产生密集掩码，显著提升推理速度并保持强大理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将图像分割集成到多模态大语言模型中时，通常使用边界点表示或专用分割头，这些方法依赖离散表示或语义提示，限制了MLLM捕捉细粒度视觉细节的能力。

Method: 提出基于图像生成的分割框架，利用MLLM输出视觉标记，通过通用VQ-VAE解码为图像，使分割完全依赖MLLM的像素级理解。采用下一尺度预测策略并行生成所需视觉标记以减少推理延迟。

Result: 在多个分割数据集上超越先前最先进方法，推理速度显著提升，同时保持强大的理解能力。

Conclusion: ARGenSeg通过生成式方法统一多模态理解和像素级感知，为图像分割提供了新的有效范式。

Abstract: We propose a novel AutoRegressive Generation-based paradigm for image
Segmentation (ARGenSeg), achieving multimodal understanding and pixel-level
perception within a unified framework. Prior works integrating image
segmentation into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically employ
either boundary points representation or dedicated segmentation heads. These
methods rely on discrete representations or semantic prompts fed into
task-specific decoders, which limits the ability of the MLLM to capture
fine-grained visual details. To address these challenges, we introduce a
segmentation framework for MLLM based on image generation, which naturally
produces dense masks for target objects. We leverage MLLM to output visual
tokens and detokenize them into images using an universal VQ-VAE, making the
segmentation fully dependent on the pixel-level understanding of the MLLM. To
reduce inference latency, we employ a next-scale-prediction strategy to
generate required visual tokens in parallel. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses prior state-of-the-art approaches on multiple
segmentation datasets with a remarkable boost in inference speed, while
maintaining strong understanding capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于纯Transformer的自回归视频预测模型，在物理模拟数据集上实现更长时间的准确预测，比现有方法提升50%的时间范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受自回归大语言模型启发，将Transformer应用于视频预测领域，专注于解决物理模拟中时间因果建模的现有不足。

Method: 使用纯Transformer架构，比较不同时空自注意力布局，采用连续像素空间表示进行端到端训练，无需复杂训练策略或潜在特征学习组件。

Result: 相比现有潜在空间方法，物理准确预测的时间范围显著延长50%，同时保持可比视频质量指标，并能通过探测模型准确估计PDE模拟参数。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于注意力的时空视频建模提供了一个简单、参数高效且可解释的平台。

Abstract: Inspired by the performance and scalability of autoregressive large language
models (LLMs), transformer-based models have seen recent success in the visual
domain. This study investigates a transformer adaptation for video prediction
with a simple end-to-end approach, comparing various spatiotemporal
self-attention layouts. Focusing on causal modeling of physical simulations
over time; a common shortcoming of existing video-generative approaches, we
attempt to isolate spatiotemporal reasoning via physical object tracking
metrics and unsupervised training on physical simulation datasets. We introduce
a simple yet effective pure transformer model for autoregressive video
prediction, utilizing continuous pixel-space representations for video
prediction. Without the need for complex training strategies or latent
feature-learning components, our approach significantly extends the time
horizon for physically accurate predictions by up to 50% when compared with
existing latent-space approaches, while maintaining comparable performance on
common video quality metrics. In addition, we conduct interpretability
experiments to identify network regions that encode information useful to
perform accurate estimations of PDE simulation parameters via probing models,
and find that this generalizes to the estimation of out-of-distribution
simulation parameters. This work serves as a platform for further
attention-based spatiotemporal modeling of videos via a simple, parameter
efficient, and interpretable approach.

*Yuhan Liu,Lianhui Qin,Shengjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Speculative Verdict (SV)框架，通过结合多个轻量级草稿专家和大型裁决模型，在无需训练的情况下解决密集信息图像的多模态推理问题，实现错误纠正和成本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在处理密集信息图像时面临挑战，难以精确定位关键线索并进行多跳推理来整合分散的证据。

Method: 采用推测解码思想，在草稿阶段使用小型VLM生成多样化的定位候选推理路径，在裁决阶段使用强大VLM综合这些路径生成最终答案，并引入共识专家选择机制提高效率。

Result: 在InfographicVQA、ChartMuseum、ChartQAPro和HR-Bench 4K等挑战性基准测试中取得一致性能提升，相比大型专有模型或训练流程实现了错误纠正和成本效率。

Conclusion: SV框架通过综合多个部分准确的推理路径中的正确见解，在无需训练的情况下有效解决了密集信息图像的视觉问答问题，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal understanding, yet they struggle when reasoning over
information-intensive images that densely interleave textual annotations with
fine-grained graphical elements. The main challenges lie in precisely
localizing critical cues in dense layouts and multi-hop reasoning to integrate
dispersed evidence. We propose Speculative Verdict (SV), a training-free
framework inspired by speculative decoding that combines multiple lightweight
draft experts with a large verdict model. In the draft stage, small VLMs act as
draft experts to generate reasoning paths that provide diverse localization
candidates; in the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths to
produce the final answer, minimizing computational cost while recovering
correct answers. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, SV introduces a
consensus expert selection mechanism that forwards only high-agreement
reasoning paths to the verdict. Empirically, SV achieves consistent gains on
challenging information-intensive and high-resolution visual question answering
benchmarks, including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K.
By synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning
paths, SV achieves both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large
proprietary models or training pipelines. Code is available at

*Ritik Shah,Marco F Duarte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SpectraMorph框架，通过物理引导的自监督融合方法解决高光谱图像超分辨率问题，使用解混瓶颈结构提高可解释性，在单波段MSI下仍保持鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法缺乏可解释性，且在MSI波段数很少时容易失效，需要一种更稳健且可解释的融合方法。

Method: 采用解混瓶颈结构：从低分辨率HSI提取端元特征，用多层感知机从MSI预测丰度图，通过线性混合重建光谱，使用MSI传感器光谱响应函数进行自监督训练。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，SpectraMorph始终优于最先进的无监督/自监督基线方法，与监督基线方法相比也很有竞争力。

Conclusion: SpectraMorph提供可解释的中间结果，训练时间不到一分钟，即使在单波段MSI下也能保持鲁棒性，为高光谱超分辨率提供了有效的物理引导自监督解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral sensors capture dense spectra per pixel but suffer from low
spatial resolution, causing blurred boundaries and mixed-pixel effects.
Co-registered companion sensors such as multispectral, RGB, or panchromatic
cameras provide high-resolution spatial detail, motivating hyperspectral
super-resolution through the fusion of hyperspectral and multispectral images
(HSI-MSI). Existing deep learning based methods achieve strong performance but
rely on opaque regressors that lack interpretability and often fail when the
MSI has very few bands. We propose SpectraMorph, a physics-guided
self-supervised fusion framework with a structured latent space. Instead of
direct regression, SpectraMorph enforces an unmixing bottleneck: endmember
signatures are extracted from the low-resolution HSI, and a compact multilayer
perceptron predicts abundance-like maps from the MSI. Spectra are reconstructed
by linear mixing, with training performed in a self-supervised manner via the
MSI sensor's spectral response function. SpectraMorph produces interpretable
intermediates, trains in under a minute, and remains robust even with a
single-band (pan-chromatic) MSI. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets show SpectraMorph consistently outperforming state-of-the-art
unsupervised/self-supervised baselines while remaining very competitive against
supervised baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出LDDBM框架，通过潜在空间扩散模型实现任意模态间的跨模态转换，无需对齐维度或共享架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在单模态领域表现出色，但在跨模态转换方面存在限制，如要求共享维度、高斯先验假设和特定架构，限制了通用性和理论基础。

Method: 基于潜在变量扩展的Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models，在共享潜在空间中学习模态间桥梁；引入对比对齐损失确保语义一致性；设计领域无关的编码器-解码器架构；提出预测损失指导跨域转换训练。

Result: 在多种跨模态任务上表现优异，包括多视图到3D形状生成、图像超分辨率和多视图场景合成，建立了跨模态转换的新基准。

Conclusion: LDDBM提供了一个通用框架，支持任意模态对之间的转换，无需维度对齐或特定架构，为跨模态转换建立了新的强基线。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have positioned diffusion models as
state-of-the-art tools for sampling from complex data distributions. While
these models have shown remarkable success across single-modality domains such
as images and audio, extending their capabilities to Modality Translation (MT),
translating information across different sensory modalities, remains an open
challenge. Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, including
shared dimensionality, Gaussian source priors, and modality-specific
architectures, which limit their generality and theoretical grounding. In this
work, we propose the Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM), a
general-purpose framework for modality translation based on a latent-variable
extension of Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models. By operating in a shared latent
space, our method learns a bridge between arbitrary modalities without
requiring aligned dimensions. We introduce a contrastive alignment loss to
enforce semantic consistency between paired samples and design a
domain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture tailored for noise prediction in
latent space. Additionally, we propose a predictive loss to guide training
toward accurate cross-domain translation and explore several training
strategies to improve stability. Our approach supports arbitrary modality pairs
and performs strongly on diverse MT tasks, including multi-view to 3D shape
generation, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis.
Comprehensive experiments and ablations validate the effectiveness of our
framework, establishing a new strong baseline in general modality translation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayerComposer是一个交互式多主体个性化文本到图像生成框架，通过分层画布和锁定机制实现精确的空间控制和身份保持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有个性化生成模型缺乏对空间组合的交互控制，且难以扩展到多个主体。

Method: 引入分层画布表示，每个主体放在独立层上实现无遮挡组合；采用锁定机制保持选定层的高保真度，同时让其他层灵活适应上下文。

Result: 在多个主体个性化图像生成任务中，相比最先进方法实现了更优越的空间控制和身份保持。

Conclusion: LayerComposer通过直观的分层操作和无需架构改变的锁定机制，显著提升了多主体个性化图像生成的交互控制能力。

Abstract: Despite their impressive visual fidelity, existing personalized generative
models lack interactive control over spatial composition and scale poorly to
multiple subjects. To address these limitations, we present LayerComposer, an
interactive framework for personalized, multi-subject text-to-image generation.
Our approach introduces two main contributions: (1) a layered canvas, a novel
representation in which each subject is placed on a distinct layer, enabling
occlusion-free composition; and (2) a locking mechanism that preserves selected
layers with high fidelity while allowing the remaining layers to adapt flexibly
to the surrounding context. Similar to professional image-editing software, the
proposed layered canvas allows users to place, resize, or lock input subjects
through intuitive layer manipulation. Our versatile locking mechanism requires
no architectural changes, relying instead on inherent positional embeddings
combined with a new complementary data sampling strategy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that LayerComposer achieves superior spatial control and identity
preservation compared to the state-of-the-art methods in multi-subject
personalized image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HoloCine是一个文本到视频生成模型，能够生成具有全局一致性的多镜头叙事场景，解决了现有模型在叙事连贯性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到视频模型擅长生成孤立片段，但在创建连贯的多镜头叙事方面存在不足，这限制了它们在电影制作等叙事性应用中的使用。

Method: 采用Window Cross-Attention机制将文本提示定位到特定镜头，并使用稀疏的镜头间自注意力模式（镜头内密集，镜头间稀疏）来确保分钟级生成的效率。

Result: HoloCine在叙事连贯性方面达到了新的最先进水平，并展现出对角色和场景的持久记忆能力以及对电影技术的直观理解等新兴能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作标志着从片段合成向自动化电影制作的关键转变，使端到端的电影创作成为可实现的未来。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-video models excel at generating isolated clips but
fall short of creating the coherent, multi-shot narratives, which are the
essence of storytelling. We bridge this "narrative gap" with HoloCine, a model
that generates entire scenes holistically to ensure global consistency from the
first shot to the last. Our architecture achieves precise directorial control
through a Window Cross-Attention mechanism that localizes text prompts to
specific shots, while a Sparse Inter-Shot Self-Attention pattern (dense within
shots but sparse between them) ensures the efficiency required for minute-scale
generation. Beyond setting a new state-of-the-art in narrative coherence,
HoloCine develops remarkable emergent abilities: a persistent memory for
characters and scenes, and an intuitive grasp of cinematic techniques. Our work
marks a pivotal shift from clip synthesis towards automated filmmaking, making
end-to-end cinematic creation a tangible future. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: DeBERTa-KC是一个基于Transformer的模型，用于自动分类在线科学学习讨论中的知识建构水平，在YouTube科学频道评论数据集上取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够自动分析在线科学学习环境中知识建构水平的工具，以支持大规模的非正式数字学习环境中的话语分析。

Method: 扩展DeBERTa-v3模型，结合Focal Loss、Label Smoothing和R-Drop正则化技术来处理类别不平衡并增强泛化能力，构建了端到端的可复现流程。

Result: 在10折分层交叉验证中，DeBERTa-KC实现了0.836±0.008的宏F1分数，显著优于传统和Transformer基线模型(p<0.01)，对高阶认知参与的探索和协商类别表现出强敏感性。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型能够有效捕捉非正式数字学习环境中知识建构的细微指标，为话语分析和认知参与评估工具的开发提供了可扩展的理论指导方法。

Abstract: This study presents DeBERTa-KC, a transformer-based model for automatic
classification of knowledge construction (KC) levels in online science learning
discourse. Using comments collected from four popular YouTube science channels
(2022--2024), a balanced corpus of 20,000 manually annotated samples was
created across four KC categories: \textit{nonKC}, \textit{Share},
\textit{Explore}, and \textit{Negotiate}. The proposed model extends DeBERTa-v3
with Focal Loss, Label Smoothing, and R-Drop regularization to address class
imbalance and enhance generalization. A reproducible end-to-end pipeline was
implemented, encompassing data extraction, annotation, preprocessing, training,
and evaluation. Across 10-fold stratified cross-validation, DeBERTa-KC achieved
a macro-F1 of $0.836 \pm 0.008$, significantly out-performing both classical
and transformer baselines ($p<0.01$). Per-category results indicate strong
sensitivity to higher-order epistemic engagement, particularly in
\textit{Explore} and \textit{Negotiate} discourse. These findings demonstrate
that large language models can effectively capture nuanced indicators of
knowledge construction in informal digital learning environments, offering
scalable, theory-informed approaches to discourse analysis and the development
of automated tools for assessing epistemic engagement.

*Xincheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了五种主流大语言模型生成教案的教学合理性和可用性，发现模型选择对可读性影响最大，而提示框架结构对事实准确性和教学完整性影响更大。最佳配置是结合可读性优化的模型与RACE框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估AI生成教案的教学质量和可用性，为教育工作者提供选择模型和提示框架的指导，确保生成的教案既易读又教学可靠。

Method: 使用五种大语言模型和三种提示框架生成15份高中物理教案，通过四个自动化计算指标分析：可读性、事实准确性、课程标准对齐和认知需求。

Result: DeepSeek生成最易读的教案，Claude语言最密集；RACE框架产生最低的幻觉指数和最高的课程标准对齐；所有教案的学习目标主要集中在布鲁姆分类法的低阶层次。

Conclusion: 可读性主要由模型设计决定，而教学可靠性和课程对齐更依赖提示框架。最佳实践是结合可读性优化的模型、RACE框架和明确的概念清单。

Abstract: This study evaluates the pedagogical soundness and usability of AI-generated
lesson plans across five leading large language models: ChatGPT (GPT-5), Claude
Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, DeepSeek V3.2, and Grok 4. Beyond model choice,
three structured prompt frameworks were tested: TAG (Task, Audience, Goal),
RACE (Role, Audience, Context, Execution), and COSTAR (Context, Objective,
Style, Tone, Audience, Response Format).
  Fifteen lesson plans were generated for a single high-school physics topic,
The Electromagnetic Spectrum. The lesson plans were analyzed through four
automated computational metrics: (1) readability and linguistic complexity, (2)
factual accuracy and hallucination detection, (3) standards and curriculum
alignment, and (4) cognitive demand of learning objectives.
  Results indicate that model selection exerted the strongest influence on
linguistic accessibility, with DeepSeek producing the most readable teaching
plan (FKGL = 8.64) and Claude generating the densest language (FKGL = 19.89).
  The prompt framework structure most strongly affected the factual accuracy
and pedagogical completeness, with the RACE framework yielding the lowest
hallucination index and the highest incidental alignment with NGSS curriculum
standards. Across all models, the learning objectives in the fifteen lesson
plans clustered at the Remember and Understand tiers of Bloom's taxonomy. There
were limited higher-order verbs in the learning objectives extracted.
  Overall, the findings suggest that readability is significantly governed by
model design, while instructional reliability and curricular alignment depend
more on the prompt framework. The most effective configuration for lesson plans
identified in the results was to combine a readability-optimized model with the
RACE framework and an explicit checklist of physics concepts, curriculum
standards, and higher-order objectives.

TL;DR: ReDiff是一个改进的离散扩散模型框架，通过主动精炼而非被动去噪来解决并行解码中的错误级联问题，显著提升了生成内容的连贯性和事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散扩散模型在视觉语言任务中面临训练-推理差异问题，初始标记错误会污染生成上下文，导致语法错误和语义幻觉的级联错误。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：首先训练模型修正合成错误建立基础修订能力，然后通过在线自校正循环让模型学习修正自己的错误草稿。

Result: 实验表明ReDiff显著改善了生成内容的连贯性和事实准确性，实现了比传统去噪方法更稳定高效的并行生成。

Conclusion: ReDiff通过主动精炼和错误驱动学习有效打破了错误级联，为离散扩散模型的实用化提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a promising direction for
vision-language tasks, offering bidirectional context modeling and theoretical
parallelization. However, their practical application is severely hindered by a
train-inference discrepancy, which leads to catastrophic error cascades:
initial token errors during parallel decoding pollute the generation context,
triggering a chain reaction of compounding errors and leading to syntactic
errors and semantic hallucinations. To address this fundamental challenge, we
reframe the generation process from passive denoising to active refining. We
introduce ReDiff, a refining-enhanced diffusion framework that teaches the
model to identify and correct its own errors. Our approach features a two-stage
training process: first, we instill a foundational revision capability by
training the model to revise synthetic errors; second, we implement a novel
online self-correction loop where the model is explicitly trained to revise its
own flawed drafts by learning from an expert's corrections. This mistake-driven
learning endows the model with the crucial ability to revisit and refine its
already generated output, effectively breaking the error cascade. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ReDiff significantly improves the coherence and
factual accuracy of generated content, enabling stable and efficient parallel
generation far superior to traditional denoising methods. Our codes and models
are available at https://rediff-hku.github.io/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机制可解释性技术在分析注意力时随上下文长度呈二次方扩展，在超过10万token时需要TB级内存，无法处理百万token级上下文。

Method: Stream算法采用可编译的分层剪枝方法，通过二分搜索式精化保留每个查询的前k个关键块，同时保持模型的下一个token行为。

Result: 在长链式推理轨迹中识别思维锚点，剪枝97-99%的token交互；在RULER基准上保留关键检索路径，剪枝90-96%的交互，揭示从针到输出的层间路径。

Conclusion: Sparse Tracing为分析注意力模式和追踪信息流提供了实用的即插即用工具，使长上下文可解释性在消费级GPU上可行，有助于民主化链式思维监控。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale to million-token contexts, traditional
Mechanistic Interpretability techniques for analyzing attention scale
quadratically with context length, demanding terabytes of memory beyond 100,000
tokens. We introduce Sparse Tracing, a novel technique that leverages dynamic
sparse attention to efficiently analyze long context attention patterns. We
present Stream, a compilable hierarchical pruning algorithm that estimates
per-head sparse attention masks in near-linear time $O(T \log T)$ and linear
space $O(T)$, enabling one-pass interpretability at scale. Stream performs a
binary-search-style refinement to retain only the top-$k$ key blocks per query
while preserving the model's next-token behavior. We apply Stream to long
chain-of-thought reasoning traces and identify thought anchors while pruning
97-99\% of token interactions. On the RULER benchmark, Stream preserves
critical retrieval paths while discarding 90-96\% of interactions and exposes
layer-wise routes from the needle to output. Our method offers a practical
drop-in tool for analyzing attention patterns and tracing information flow
without terabytes of caches. By making long context interpretability feasible
on consumer GPUs, Sparse Tracing helps democratize chain-of-thought monitoring.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注结构化数据，忽视了临床笔记等非结构化文本数据中可能包含的HIV风险相关信息。电子健康记录的普及为解决HIV筛查和早期诊断提供了新机会。

Method: 开发了一个新颖的流程，利用大语言模型分析非结构化的电子健康记录文本数据，评估患者进行HIV检测的资格。

Result: 在伊拉斯谟大学医学中心鹿特丹分校的临床数据上进行的实验表明，该流程实现了高准确率，同时保持了较低假阴性率。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效利用非结构化文本数据进行HIV筛查，为HIV早期诊断提供了新的可行方案。

Abstract: Efficient screening and early diagnosis of HIV are critical for reducing
onward transmission. Although large scale laboratory testing is not feasible,
the widespread adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers new
opportunities to address this challenge. Existing research primarily focuses on
applying machine learning methods to structured data, such as patient
demographics, for improving HIV diagnosis. However, these approaches often
overlook unstructured text data such as clinical notes, which potentially
contain valuable information relevant to HIV risk. In this study, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze
unstructured EHR text and determine a patient's eligibility for further HIV
testing. Experimental results on clinical data from Erasmus University Medical
Center Rotterdam demonstrate that our pipeline achieved high accuracy while
maintaining a low false negative rate.

TL;DR: 本研究首次通过专家基准测试评估了11个通用大语言模型在生命周期评估(LCA)中的表现，发现37%的回答包含不准确或误导性信息，幻觉率高达40%，揭示了在LCA中直接应用LLM的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI和大语言模型越来越多地被探索作为支持生命周期评估的工具，但缺乏对其可靠性、鲁棒性和可用性的系统证据，且该领域没有标准化的评估框架。

Method: 评估了11个通用LLM在22个LCA相关任务上的表现，由17位经验丰富的从业者根据科学准确性、解释质量、鲁棒性、可验证性和指令遵循等标准审查模型输出，收集了168份专家评审。

Result: 专家判断37%的回答包含不准确或误导信息；准确性和解释质量评分普遍为中等或良好；幻觉率差异显著，某些模型的幻觉引用率高达40%；开源模型在准确性和解释质量等标准上表现优于或与闭源模型相当。

Conclusion: 研究结果凸显了在LCA中直接应用LLM的风险，特别是在将LLM视为自由形式预言机时，同时也显示了在解释质量和减轻简单任务劳动强度方面的益处。没有基础机制支持的通用LLM使用存在风险。

Abstract: Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular large language
models (LLMs), are increasingly being explored as tools to support life cycle
assessment (LCA). While demonstrations exist across environmental and social
domains, systematic evidence on their reliability, robustness, and usability
remains limited. This study provides the first expert-grounded benchmark of
LLMs in LCA, addressing the absence of standardized evaluation frameworks in a
field where no clear ground truth or consensus protocols exist.
  Methods: We evaluated eleven general-purpose LLMs, spanning both commercial
and open-source families, across 22 LCA-related tasks. Seventeen experienced
practitioners reviewed model outputs against criteria directly relevant to LCA
practice, including scientific accuracy, explanation quality, robustness,
verifiability, and adherence to instructions. We collected 168 expert reviews.
  Results: Experts judged 37% of responses to contain inaccurate or misleading
information. Ratings of accuracy and quality of explanation were generally
rated average or good on many models even smaller models, and format adherence
was generally rated favourably. Hallucination rates varied significantly, with
some models producing hallucinated citations at rates of up to 40%. There was
no clear-cut distinction between ratings on open-weight versus closed-weight
LLMs, with open-weight models outperforming or competing on par with
closed-weight models on criteria such as accuracy and quality of explanation.
  Conclusion: These findings highlight the risks of applying LLMs na\"ively in
LCA, such as when LLMs are treated as free-form oracles, while also showing
benefits especially around quality of explanation and alleviating labour
intensiveness of simple tasks. The use of general-purpose LLMs without

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态大语言模型评估存在静态基准测试无法综合评估能力、人工或模型对比评估主观性强且成本高、模型可能利用表面特征（如冗长性）来提升胜率等问题。

Method: 提出游戏化评估框架，使用Dixit幻想卡牌游戏作为评估平台，要求模型为卡牌生成能够欺骗部分玩家但非全部玩家的描述。

Result: 实验显示Dixit游戏胜率排名与流行MLM基准测试排名完全相关，同时揭示了人类与MLM玩家在游戏策略上的差异以及MLM推理能力的改进空间。

Conclusion: 游戏化评估为多模态大语言模型提供了更全面、客观和吸引人的评估框架，能够有效解决传统评估方法的局限性。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLMs) are often assessed on static,
individual benchmarks -- which cannot jointly assess MLM capabilities in a
single task -- or rely on human or model pairwise comparisons -- which is
highly subjective, expensive, and allows models to exploit superficial
shortcuts (e.g., verbosity) to inflate their win-rates. To overcome these
issues, we propose game-based evaluations to holistically assess MLM
capabilities. Games require multiple abilities for players to win, are
inherently competitive, and are governed by fix, objective rules, and makes
evaluation more engaging, providing a robust framework to address the
aforementioned challenges. We manifest this evaluation specifically through
Dixit, a fantasy card game where players must generate captions for a card that
trick some, but not all players, into selecting the played card. Our
quantitative experiments with five MLMs show Dixit win-rate rankings are
perfectly correlated with those on popular MLM benchmarks, while games between
human and MLM players in Dixit reveal several differences between agent
strategies and areas of improvement for MLM reasoning.

TL;DR: 该研究评估DeepSeek-R1 LLM在运筹学优化建模中的应用，通过四种基准测试和多种缓解策略来减少幻觉并提高模型输出准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化方法严重依赖领域专家将实际问题转化为可求解数学模型，LLMs有望通过自然语言理解和代码生成来弥合这一建模差距。

Method: 在NL4OPT、IndustryOR、EasyLP和ComplexOR四个基准上系统评估DeepSeek-R1，采用LLM-as-a-Judge、Few-shot Learning、Tool Calling和多智能体框架等缓解策略。

Result: DeepSeek-R1作为成本效益高且性能良好的模型，在LiveCodeBench和Math-500等基准上表现出色，但在应用运筹学场景中的有效性仍需探索。

Conclusion: LLMs与优化建模的集成为运筹学决策提供了有前景的方向，DeepSeek-R1通过适当的缓解策略可以成为实际应用的可行替代方案。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with optimization modeling
offers a promising avenue for advancing decision-making in operations research
(OR). Traditional optimization methods,such as linear programming, mixed
integer programming, and simulation depend heavily on domain expertise to
translate real-world problems into solvable mathematical models. While solvers
like Gurobi and COPT are powerful, expert input remains essential for defining
objectives, constraints, and variables. This research investigates the
potential of LLMs, specifically the DeepSeek-R1 model, to bridge this
formulation gap using natural language understanding and code generation.
Although prior models like GPT-4, Claude, and Bard have shown strong
performance in NLP and reasoning tasks, their high token costs and tendency
toward hallucinations limit real-world applicability in supply chain contexts.
In contrast, DeepSeek-R1, a cost-efficient and high-performing model trained
with reinforcement learning, presents a viable alternative. Despite its success
in benchmarks such as LiveCodeBench and Math-500, its effectiveness in applied
OR scenarios remains under explored. This study systematically evaluates
DeepSeek-R1 across four key OR benchmarks: NL4OPT, IndustryOR, EasyLP, and
ComplexOR. Our methodology includes baseline assessments, the development of a
hallucination taxonomy, and the application of mitigation strategies like
LLM-as-a-Judge, Few-shot Learning (FSL), Tool Calling, and a Multi-agent
Framework. These techniques aim to reduce hallucinations, enhance formulation
accuracy, and better align model outputs with user intent.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于记忆增强的LLM代理框架，通过存储实例级批评和提炼任务级指导，在不更新参数的情况下从标记示例中学习分类函数，相比仅依赖标签的检索基线准确率提升高达24.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微调方法成本高、不灵活且不透明，需要探索无需参数更新的学习方式，使LLM代理能够从标记数据中有效学习。

Method: 采用记忆增强框架，包含情景记忆存储实例级批评，语义记忆提炼可重用的任务级指导，结合标记数据和LLM生成的批评进行学习。

Result: 在多样化任务集上，引入批评比仅依赖标签的检索基线准确率提升高达24.8%，揭示了OpenAI和开源模型在处理事实导向与偏好数据时的行为差异。

Conclusion: 记忆驱动的反思学习为构建更具适应性和可解释性的LLM代理提供了有前景的方向，模型特性和记忆策略共同塑造学习动态。

Abstract: We investigate how agents built on pretrained large language models can learn
target classification functions from labeled examples without parameter
updates. While conventional approaches like fine-tuning are often costly,
inflexible, and opaque, we propose a memory-augmented framework that leverages
both labeled data and LLM-generated critiques. Our framework uses episodic
memory to store instance-level critiques-capturing specific past
experiences-and semantic memory to distill these into reusable, task-level
guidance. Across a diverse set of tasks, incorporating critiques yields up to a
24.8 percent accuracy improvement over retrieval-based (RAG-style) baselines
that rely only on labels. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we uncover
distinct behavioral differences between OpenAI and opensource models,
particularly in how they handle fact-oriented versus preference-based data. To
interpret how models respond to different representations of supervision
encoded in memory, we introduce a novel metric, suggestibility. This helps
explain observed behaviors and illuminates how model characteristics and memory
strategies jointly shape learning dynamics. Our findings highlight the promise
of memory-driven, reflective learning for building more adaptive and
interpretable LLM agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LyriCAR是一个无监督歌词翻译框架，通过难度感知课程设计和自适应课程策略，在减少40%训练步骤的同时实现最先进的翻译性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有歌词翻译方法依赖手工规则和句子级建模，难以内化音乐语言模式和在段落级别保持跨行连贯性和全局韵律

Method: 提出LyriCAR框架，包含难度感知课程设计师和自适应课程策略，以无监督方式逐步引导模型处理复杂挑战

Result: 在英中歌词翻译任务中，LyriCAR在标准翻译指标和多维奖励分数上都达到了最先进水平

Conclusion: LyriCAR通过自适应课程学习有效提高了歌词翻译质量，同时显著减少了训练成本

Abstract: Lyric translation is a challenging task that requires balancing multiple
musical constraints. Existing methods often rely on hand-crafted rules and
sentence-level modeling, which restrict their ability to internalize
musical-linguistic patterns and to generalize effectively at the paragraph
level, where cross-line coherence and global rhyme are crucial. In this work,
we propose LyriCAR, a novel framework for controllable lyric translation that
operates in a fully unsupervised manner. LyriCAR introduces a difficulty-aware
curriculum designer and an adaptive curriculum strategy, ensuring efficient
allocation of training resources, accelerating convergence, and improving
overall translation quality by guiding the model with increasingly complex
challenges. Extensive experiments on the EN-ZH lyric translation task show that
LyriCAR achieves state-of-the-art results across both standard translation
metrics and multi-dimensional reward scores, surpassing strong baselines.
Notably, the adaptive curriculum strategy reduces training steps by nearly 40%
while maintaining superior performance. Code, data and model can be accessed at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然应用广泛，但存在幻觉和输出结构不一致的问题；而符号NLU系统虽然能提供可解释的结构化表示，但覆盖范围有限且需要专业知识维护。本文旨在结合两者的优势。

Method: 使用LLMs进行文本重述和简化以提供广泛覆盖，并作为填补知识缺口的来源；使用符号NLU生成可用于推理和增量学习的结构化关系表示。

Result: 在从常识科学文本中提取和解释数量和因果规律的任务上，混合方法显著优于纯符号方法。

Conclusion: 混合方法结合了LLMs的广泛覆盖能力和符号NLU的结构化表示能力，在特定任务上取得了更好的效果。

Abstract: Despite the broad applicability of large language models (LLMs), their
reliance on probabilistic inference makes them vulnerable to errors such as
hallucination in generated facts and inconsistent output structure in natural
language understanding (NLU) tasks. By contrast, symbolic NLU systems provide
interpretable understanding grounded in curated lexicons, semantic resources,
and syntactic & semantic interpretation rules. They produce relational
representations that can be used for accurate reasoning and planning, as well
as incremental debuggable learning. However, symbolic NLU systems tend to be
more limited in coverage than LLMs and require scarce knowledge representation
and linguistics skills to extend and maintain. This paper explores a hybrid
approach that integrates the broad-coverage language processing of LLMs with
the symbolic NLU capabilities of producing structured relational
representations to hopefully get the best of both approaches. We use LLMs for
rephrasing and text simplification, to provide broad coverage, and as a source
of information to fill in knowledge gaps more automatically. We use symbolic
NLU to produce representations that can be used for reasoning and for
incremental learning. We evaluate this approach on the task of extracting and
interpreting quantities and causal laws from commonsense science texts, along
with symbolic- and LLM-only pipelines. Our results suggest that our hybrid
method works significantly better than the symbolic-only pipeline.

Motivation: 开发一种更符合人脑处理方式的自然语言解析算法，不同于传统的短语结构解析方法

Method: 采用逐个单词处理的依赖解析方法，每个单词一旦可以连接就立即连接，模拟人脑的实时解析过程

Result: 算法在最坏情况下具有O(n³)复杂度，但在自然语言中这种最坏情况仅出现在小规模n时

Conclusion: 该依赖解析算法在保持理论复杂度的同时，更贴近人脑的实际语言处理机制

Abstract: This paper presents a fundamental algorithm for parsing natural language
sentences into dependency trees. Unlike phrase-structure (constituency)
parsers, this algorithm operates one word at a time, attaching each word as
soon as it can be attached, corresponding to properties claimed for the parser

Motivation: 现有医疗数据集如MedQA过于简化，不能充分代表真实世界的临床决策过程，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 提出基于临床背景和临床问题两个维度的分类范式，总结现有数据集设置，回顾训练时和测试时技术方法，并扩展评估指标。

Result: 建立了一个系统化的评估框架，能够更准确地反映LLMs在临床环境中的实际表现，标准化了比较方法。

Conclusion: 该范式有助于澄清假设、标准化比较，并指导开发具有临床意义的LLMs，同时指出了未来的挑战。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical use. They are often
evaluated using datasets such as MedQA. However, Many medical datasets, such as
MedQA, rely on simplified Question-Answering (Q\A) that underrepresents
real-world clinical decision-making. Based on this, we propose a unifying
paradigm that characterizes clinical decision-making tasks along two
dimensions: Clinical Backgrounds and Clinical Questions. As the background and
questions approach the real clinical environment, the difficulty increases. We
summarize the settings of existing datasets and benchmarks along two
dimensions. Then we review methods to address clinical decision-making,
including training-time and test-time techniques, and summarize when they help.
Next, we extend evaluation beyond accuracy to include efficiency,
explainability. Finally, we highlight open challenges. Our paradigm clarifies
assumptions, standardizes comparisons, and guides the development of clinically
meaningful LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了希腊语嵌入模型(GEM)系列，针对希腊语等形态丰富但资源中等语言，通过精心构建大规模语料库和采用多样化现代架构，显著提升了希腊语NLP性能，特别是在法律领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希腊语等形态丰富但资源中等语言的NLP发展受到研究碎片化、架构单一和上下文长度限制的阻碍，特别是在法律等专业领域，现有模型通常局限于早期transformer架构和512个token的窗口，无法处理长法律文档。

Method: 通过严格的质量驱动数据筛选和预处理方法构建大规模希腊语语料库，包括通用领域和专业法律来源；预训练并系统评估多种现代架构(ELECTRA、ConvBERT、ModernBERT)；提出首个针对法律领域的希腊语-英语双语嵌入模型。

Result: 在下游任务上的广泛实验表明，新模型类别证明了所提方法的有效性，GEM-RoBERTa和GEM-ConvBERT模型显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 通过精心构建的高质量语料库和多样化现代架构，成功开发了性能优越的希腊语嵌入模型，为希腊语NLP研究提供了新的基准和方向。

Abstract: The advancement of natural language processing for morphologically rich,
moderately-resourced languages like Modern Greek is often hindered by a
fragmented research landscape, a lack of architectural diversity and reliance
on limited context-length models. This is particularly true in specialized,
high-value domains such as law, where existing models are frequently confined
to early transformer architectures with a restrictive 512-token window,
insufficient for analyzing long legal documents. To address these challenges,
this paper presents Greek Embedding Models, a new family of transformer models
for Greek language built upon a foundation of extensive, quality-driven data
curation. We detail the construction of several large-scale Greek corpora,
emphasizing a rigorous, quality-based filtering and preprocessing methodology
to create high-value training datasets from both general-domain and specialized
legal sources. On this carefully curated foundation, we pre-train and
systematically evaluate a diverse suite of modern architectures, which has not
previously applied to Greek language, such as ELECTRA, ConvBERT and ModernBERT.
Furthermore, we propose the first bilingual Greek-English Embedding Models
tailored for the legal domain. The extensive experiments on downstream tasks
demonstrate that the new class of models establish the effectiveness of the
proposed approach, highlighting that the GEM-RoBERTa and GEM-ConvBERT models
significantly outperform existing baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的预训练语言模型在序列标注任务中的迁移学习效果仍有提升空间，需要更有效的适应方法来充分发挥其潜力。

Method: 1. 多任务模型：引入领域无关文本处理系统的额外信号；2. 架构修改：在自回归大语言模型中实现跨层双向信息流；3. 生成式监督上下文微调框架：结合响应导向适应策略。

Result: 提出的模型、方法和框架表明，通过有针对性的迁移学习范式，预训练神经语言模型在序列标注任务上能达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: 预训练语言模型在序列标注任务中的最佳性能需要通过特定的迁移学习策略来实现，包括多任务学习、架构优化和生成式微调等方法。

Abstract: This doctoral thesis improves the transfer learning for sequence labeling
tasks by adapting pre-trained neural language models. The proposed improvements
in transfer learning involve introducing a multi-task model that incorporates
an additional signal, a method based on architectural modifications in
autoregressive large language models, and a sequence labeling framework for
autoregressive large language models utilizing supervised in-context
fine-tuning combined with response-oriented adaptation strategies. The first
improvement is given in the context of domain transfer for the event trigger
detection task. The domain transfer of the event trigger detection task can be
improved by incorporating an additional signal obtained from a
domain-independent text processing system into a multi-task model. The second
improvement involves modifying the model's architecture. For that purpose, a
method is proposed to enable bidirectional information flow across layers of
autoregressive large language models. The third improvement utilizes
autoregressive large language models as text generators through a generative
supervised in-context fine-tuning framework. The proposed model, method, and
framework demonstrate that pre-trained neural language models achieve their
best performance on sequence labeling tasks when adapted through targeted
transfer learning paradigms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界工具集存在冗余工具和重叠描述，导致工具选择模糊性，同时LLM面临严格的上下文限制，无法有效处理大型工具集

Method: 包含ToolScopeMerger（自动审核和修复工具合并）和ToolScopeRetriever（按相关性排序和选择工具），压缩工具集以适应上下文限制

Result: 在三个最先进LLM和三个开源工具使用基准测试中，工具选择准确率提升8.38%至38.6%

Conclusion: ToolScope能有效增强LLM工具使用能力，解决工具冗余和上下文限制问题

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents rely on external tools to solve complex
tasks, but real-world toolsets often contain redundant tools with overlapping
names and descriptions, introducing ambiguity and reducing selection accuracy.
LLMs also face strict input context limits, preventing efficient consideration
of large toolsets. To address these challenges, we propose ToolScope, which
includes: (1) ToolScopeMerger with Auto-Correction to automatically audit and
fix tool merges, reducing redundancy, and (2) ToolScopeRetriever to rank and
select only the most relevant tools for each query, compressing toolsets to fit
within context limits without sacrificing accuracy. Evaluations on three
state-of-the-art LLMs and three open-source tool-use benchmarks show gains of
8.38% to 38.6% in tool selection accuracy, demonstrating ToolScope's
effectiveness in enhancing LLM tool use.

Method: 构建包含民间传统、烹饪艺术和区域方言的孟加拉语文化知识数据集BLanCK，并评估多个多语言语言模型在该数据集上的表现。

Result: 多语言模型在非文化类别表现良好，但在文化知识方面表现显著较差；当提供上下文时，所有模型的性能都大幅提升。

Abstract: Recent progress in NLP research has demonstrated remarkable capabilities of
large language models (LLMs) across a wide range of tasks. While recent
multilingual benchmarks have advanced cultural evaluation for LLMs, critical
gaps remain in capturing the nuances of low-resource cultures. Our work
addresses these limitations through a Bengali Language Cultural Knowledge
(BLanCK) dataset including folk traditions, culinary arts, and regional
dialects. Our investigation of several multilingual language models shows that
while these models perform well in non-cultural categories, they struggle
significantly with cultural knowledge and performance improves substantially
across all models when context is provided, emphasizing context-aware
architectures and culturally curated training data.

Motivation: 为波斯语等资源稀缺语言开发专门的医学问答系统，需要增强小语言模型的推理能力

Method: 将医学选择题数据集翻译成波斯语，使用RLAIF生成拒绝-偏好答案对，通过CoT推理构建包含正确和错误推理轨迹的数据集，然后进行DPO训练

Result: 训练后的模型在仅使用200万token偏好答案和250万token拒绝答案的情况下，性能超过了使用5700万token训练的前代模型

Conclusion: 推理导向的训练方法在数据有限的情况下能有效开发领域特定的语言模型

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities in small language models is critical for
specialized applications such as medical question answering, particularly in
underrepresented languages like Persian. In this study, we employ Reinforcement
Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) and Direct preference optimization (DPO) to
improve the reasoning skills of a general-purpose Persian language model. To
achieve this, we translated a multiple-choice medical question-answering
dataset into Persian and used RLAIF to generate rejected-preferred answer
pairs, which are essential for DPO training. By prompting both teacher and
student models to produce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning responses, we
compiled a dataset containing correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories.
This dataset, comprising 2 million tokens in preferred answers and 2.5 million
tokens in rejected ones, was used to train a baseline model, significantly
enhancing its medical reasoning capabilities in Persian. Remarkably, the
resulting model outperformed its predecessor, gaokerena-V, which was trained on
approximately 57 million tokens, despite leveraging a much smaller dataset.
These results highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of reasoning-focused
training approaches in developing domain-specific language models with limited
data availability.

TL;DR: 提出了CreativityPrism框架，将创造力分解为质量、新颖性和多样性三个维度，用于全面评估大语言模型的创造力表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型创造力评估方法碎片化，缺乏统一的评估框架，需要系统性地衡量模型在不同场景下的创造力。

Method: 设计CreativityPrism框架，包含发散思维、创意写作和逻辑推理三个领域，9个任务和20个评估指标，评估了17个最先进的专有和开源大语言模型。

Result: 专有模型和开源模型之间存在显著差距；同一领域内任务表现高度相关，跨领域相关性较弱；多样性和质量指标强相关，新颖性与其他维度相关性较弱。

Conclusion: 创造力评估需要多维度综合考量，单一任务或维度的表现不能代表整体创造力水平，支持了创造力不是单一固定概念的观点。

Abstract: Creativity is often seen as a hallmark of human intelligence. While large
language models (LLMs) are increasingly perceived as producing creative text,
there is still no holistic framework to evaluate their creativity across
diverse scenarios. Existing evaluation methods remain fragmented, with dramatic
variation across domains and tasks, largely due to differing definitions and
measurements of creativity. Inspired by the hypothesis that creativity is not
one fixed idea, we propose CreativityPrism, an evaluation analysis framework
that decomposes creativity into three dimensions: quality, novelty, and
diversity. CreativityPrism incorporates nine tasks, three domains, i.e.,
divergent thinking, creative writing, and logical reasoning, and twenty
evaluation metrics, which measure each dimension in task-specific, unique ways.
We evaluate 17 state-of-the-art (SoTA) proprietary and open-sourced LLMs on
CreativityPrism and analyze the performance correlations among different
metrics and task domains. Our results reveal a notable gap between proprietary
and open-source models. Overall, model performance tends to be highly
correlated across tasks within the same domain and less so across different
domains. Among evaluation dimensions, diversity and quality metrics show strong
correlations - models that perform well on one often excel on the other -
whereas novelty exhibits much weaker correlation with either. These findings
support our hypothesis that strong performance in one creativity task or
dimension does not necessarily generalize to others, underscoring the need for
a holistic evaluation of LLM creativity.

TL;DR: ARTER提出了一种无需深度微调的实体链接方法，通过自适应路由和选择性推理，结合候选生成、上下文评分和LLM推理，在保持高效的同时实现高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统实体链接方法依赖大量标注数据和模型微调，而现有的少样本方法虽然减少了训练需求，但LLM推理成本高昂。需要一种既能保持高性能又更高效的解决方案。

Method: ARTER采用结构化流水线：候选生成、上下文评分、自适应路由（将实体分为简单和困难两类）、选择性推理（简单实体用低成本链接器处理，困难实体用LLM推理）。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，ARTER比ReFinED提升高达4.47%，在6个数据集中的5个上平均提升2.53%，性能与全LLM推理方法相当，但LLM token使用量减少一半。

Conclusion: ARTER证明了通过智能路由和选择性使用LLM推理，可以在不牺牲性能的情况下显著提高实体链接的效率，为资源受限环境提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Entity Linking (EL) has traditionally relied on large annotated datasets and
extensive model fine-tuning. While recent few-shot methods leverage large
language models (LLMs) through prompting to reduce training requirements, they
often suffer from inefficiencies due to expensive LLM-based reasoning. ARTER
(Adaptive Routing and Targeted Entity Reasoning) presents a structured pipeline
that achieves high performance without deep fine-tuning by strategically
combining candidate generation, context-based scoring, adaptive routing, and
selective reasoning. ARTER computes a small set of complementary signals(both
embedding and LLM-based) over the retrieved candidates to categorize contextual
mentions into easy and hard cases. The cases are then handled by a
low-computational entity linker (e.g. ReFinED) and more expensive targeted
LLM-based reasoning respectively. On standard benchmarks, ARTER outperforms
ReFinED by up to +4.47%, with an average gain of +2.53% on 5 out of 6 datasets,
and performs comparably to pipelines using LLM-based reasoning for all
mentions, while being as twice as efficient in terms of the number of LLM
tokens.

TL;DR: BoundRL是一种新颖高效的文本分割方法，通过生成起始标记序列并定位原始文本来重建完整内容，大幅降低推理成本并减少幻觉。该方法结合强化学习和专门设计的奖励函数，优化文档重建保真度和语义对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着结构化文本在技术报告和生成式AI提示等领域的复杂性增加，传统基于句子或段落的分割方法无法有效处理包含表格、代码片段和占位符等非纯语言元素的文本，因此需要更有效的语义分割方法。

Method: BoundRL采用联合执行标记级文本分割和标签预测的方法，通过强化学习与可验证奖励（RLVR）优化输出格式，并构建中间候选来缓解熵崩溃问题。

Result: 实验表明，BoundRL使小型语言模型（1.7B参数）在复杂LLM应用提示的分割任务上优于大型模型的少样本提示。RLVR相比监督微调带来显著改进，中间候选的加入进一步提升了性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: BoundRL为处理复杂结构化文本提供了一种高效的分割解决方案，通过创新的起始标记生成和强化学习优化，在保持高质量分割的同时大幅降低了计算成本。

Abstract: As structured texts become increasingly complex across diverse domains --
from technical reports to generative AI prompts -- the need for text
segmentation into semantically meaningful components becomes critical. Such
texts often contain elements beyond plain language, including tables, code
snippets, and placeholders, which conventional sentence- or paragraph-level
segmentation methods cannot handle effectively. To address this challenge, we
propose BoundRL, a novel and efficient approach that jointly performs
token-level text segmentation and label prediction for long structured texts.
Instead of generating complete contents for each segment, it generates only a
sequence of starting tokens and reconstructs the complete contents by locating
these tokens within the original texts, thereby reducing inference costs by
orders of magnitude and minimizing hallucination. To adapt the model for the
output format, BoundRL~performs reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards
(RLVR) with a specifically designed reward that jointly optimizes document
reconstruction fidelity and semantic alignment. To mitigate entropy collapse,
it further constructs intermediate candidates by systematically perturbing a
fraction of generated sequences of segments to create stepping stones toward
higher-quality solutions. To demonstrate BoundRL's effectiveness on
particularly challenging structured texts, we focus evaluation on complex
prompts used for LLM applications. Experiments show that BoundRL enables small
language models (1.7B parameters) to outperform few-shot prompting of much
larger models. Moreover, RLVR with our designed reward yields significant
improvements over supervised fine-tuning, and incorporating intermediate
candidates further improves both performance and generalization.

### [107] [Are Stereotypes Leading LLMs' Zero-Shot Stance Detection ?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20154)
*Anthony Dubreuil,Antoine Gourru,Christine Largeron,Amine Trabelsi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究发现大型语言模型在立场检测任务中存在显著刻板印象偏见，特别是在零样本设置下，模型会错误地将特定观点与某些社会群体特征相关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型从预训练数据中继承了刻板印象，导致在自然语言处理任务中对某些社会群体产生偏见行为。然而，立场检测方法中的这种偏见评估在社区中被很大程度上忽视了。立场检测是最敏感的NLP任务之一，因为它通常与政治倾向相关。

Method: 在现有立场检测数据集中自动标注帖子的两个属性：特定群体的方言或口语，以及文本复杂性/可读性，以研究这些属性是否影响模型的立场检测决策。

Result: 结果显示LLMs在立场检测任务中表现出显著的刻板印象，例如错误地将支持大麻的观点与低文本复杂性相关联，将非裔美国人方言与反对唐纳德·特朗普相关联。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在零样本立场检测中存在系统性偏见，需要进一步研究来减轻这些偏见对敏感NLP任务的影响。

Abstract: Large Language Models inherit stereotypes from their pretraining data,
leading to biased behavior toward certain social groups in many Natural
Language Processing tasks, such as hateful speech detection or sentiment
analysis. Surprisingly, the evaluation of this kind of bias in stance detection
methods has been largely overlooked by the community. Stance Detection involves
labeling a statement as being against, in favor, or neutral towards a specific
target and is among the most sensitive NLP tasks, as it often relates to
political leanings. In this paper, we focus on the bias of Large Language
Models when performing stance detection in a zero-shot setting. We
automatically annotate posts in pre-existing stance detection datasets with two
attributes: dialect or vernacular of a specific group and text
complexity/readability, to investigate whether these attributes influence the
model's stance detection decisions. Our results show that LLMs exhibit
significant stereotypes in stance detection tasks, such as incorrectly
associating pro-marijuana views with low text complexity and African American
dialect with opposition to Donald Trump.

*Tian Lan,Bin Zhu,Qianghuai Jia,Junyang Ren,Haijun Li,Longyue Wang,Zhao Xu,Weihua Luo,Kaifu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepWideSearch是首个专门评估智能代理在信息搜索中同时实现深度推理和广度信息收集能力的基准测试，包含220个涵盖15个领域的问题，现有最先进代理的平均成功率仅为2.39%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前搜索代理缺乏同时进行深度多跳推理和广域信息收集的能力，这在真实应用场景如市场分析和商业发展中是严重缺陷。

Method: 通过转换现有数据集的方法，构建了包含220个问题的基准测试集，涵盖15个不同领域，要求代理处理大量数据并进行深度多跳检索推理。

Result: 实验显示即使最先进的代理在DeepWideSearch上的平均成功率仅为2.39%，错误分析揭示了四种失败模式：缺乏反思、过度依赖内部知识、检索不足和上下文溢出。

Conclusion: DeepWideSearch基准测试突显了当前代理架构在整合深度和广度搜索方面的关键局限性，为未来开发更强大稳健的信息搜索代理提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Current search agents fundamentally lack the ability to simultaneously
perform \textit{deep} reasoning over multi-hop retrieval and
\textit{wide}-scale information collection-a critical deficiency for real-world
applications like comprehensive market analysis and business development. To
bridge this gap, we introduce DeepWideSearch, the first benchmark explicitly
designed to evaluate agents to integrate depth and width in information
seeking. In DeepWideSearch, agents must process a large volume of data, each
requiring deep reasoning over multi-hop retrieval paths. Specifically, we
propose two methods to converse established datasets, resulting in a curated
collection of 220 questions spanning 15 diverse domains. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that even state-of-the-art agents achieve only 2.39% average
success rate on DeepWideSearch, highlighting the substantial challenge of
integrating depth and width search in information-seeking tasks. Furthermore,
our error analysis reveals four failure modes: lack of reflection, overreliance
on internal knowledge, insufficient retrieval, and context overflow-exposing
key limitations in current agent architectures. We publicly release
DeepWideSearch to catalyze future research on more capable and robust
information-seeking agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Mixture-of-Minds多智能体框架，将表格推理分解为规划、编码和回答三个专门角色，结合代码执行实现精确表格操作，并通过MCTS和强化学习进行自我改进训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在局限性：基于微调的方法虽然强化了语言推理，但容易产生算术错误和幻觉；基于工具的方法能精确操作表格，但依赖刚性模式且缺乏语义理解。需要整合鲁棒推理与可靠表格处理的方法。

Method: 设计三智能体框架：规划、编码、回答角色，每个智能体专注于特定任务方面。采用MCTS生成伪黄金轨迹，使用强化学习优化智能体。

Result: 在TableBench上达到62.13%的准确率，超过了OpenAI-o4-mini-high。

Conclusion: 结合结构化多智能体工作流与强化学习在表格理解方面具有很大潜力。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over tables is a critical capability for many
real-world applications. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise on
this task, but current approaches remain limited. Fine-tuning based methods
strengthen language reasoning; yet they are prone to arithmetic errors and
hallucination. In contrast, tool-based methods enable precise table
manipulation but rely on rigid schemas and lack semantic understanding. These
complementary drawbacks highlight the need for approaches that integrate robust
reasoning with reliable table processing. In this work, we propose
Mixture-of-Minds, a multi-agent framework that decomposes table reasoning into
three specialized roles: planning, coding, and answering. This design enables
each agent to focus on a specific aspect of the task while leveraging code
execution for precise table manipulation. Building on this workflow, we
introduce a self-improvement training framework that employs Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) rollouts to generate pseudo-gold trajectories and optimize agents
with reinforcement learning (RL). Extensive experiments show that
Mixture-of-Minds delivers substantial gains, reaching 62.13% on TableBench and
surpassing OpenAI-o4-mini-high. These results demonstrate the promise of
combining structured multi-agent workflows with RL to advance table
understanding.

*Maggie Bai,Ava Kim Cohen,Eleanor Koss,Charlie Lichtenbaum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过五项任务测试大语言模型的空间推理能力，发现模型在小规模任务中表现尚可，但随着任务复杂度增加，性能急剧下降，平均准确率下降42.7%，最高达84%，揭示LLMs在空间表示方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型在文本输入下的空间推理能力，评估其空间理解和计算能力，揭示语言与空间推理之间的差距。

Method: 使用五项任务测试LLMs：象限识别、几何变换、距离评估、单词搜索和滑块移动，通过增加网格维度来提升任务复杂度。

Result: LLMs在小规模任务中表现中等，但随着复杂度增加性能急剧下降，平均准确率损失42.7%，最高达84%，所有初始准确率超过50%的任务都至少损失48%的性能。

Conclusion: LLMs缺乏稳健的空间表示能力，语言与空间推理之间存在显著差距，为未来语言与几何交叉领域的基准测试奠定基础。

Abstract: This paper explores the spatial reasoning capability of large language models
(LLMs) over textual input through a suite of five tasks aimed at probing their
spatial understanding and computational abilities. The models were tested on
both fundamental spatial reasoning and multi-step problem-solving within
structured grid-based environments using tasks such as quadrant identification,
geometric transformations, distance evaluation, word searches, and tile
sliding. Each task was scaled in complexity through increasing grid dimensions,
requiring models to extend beyond simple pattern recognition into abstract
spatial reasoning. Our results reveal that while LLMs demonstrate moderate
success in all tasks with small complexity and size, performance drops off
rapidly as scale increases, with an average loss in accuracy of 42.7%, and
reaching as high as 84%. Every test that began with over 50% accuracy showed a
loss of at least 48%, illustrating the consistent nature of the deterioration.
Furthermore, their struggles with scaling complexity hint at a lack of robust
spatial representations in their underlying architectures. This paper
underscores the gap between linguistic and spatial reasoning in LLMs, offering
insights into their current limitations, and laying the groundwork for future
integrative benchmarks at the intersection of language and geometry.

*David Pohl,Marco Cognetta,Junyoung Lee,Naoaki Okazaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需解码的采样策略来近似计算语言模型对文本所有可能分词方式的概率边际化，相比传统采样方法显著降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型在推理时只评估特定分词方式的概率，但同一文本可能有多种分词方式。边际化评估能更准确反映模型对文本的真实概率，但传统采样方法需要昂贵的生成步骤，限制了采样数量和近似精度。

Method: 研究解码无关的采样策略，这些策略完全依赖廉价的分词采样方法，无需语言模型生成步骤，适用于任何模型和分词器。

Result: 实验表明，解码无关采样策略能以极小的运行时成本提供足够准确的边际概率估计，并在多个下游推理任务中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 解码无关采样策略是实现高效文本概率边际化的可行方法，在保持准确性的同时大幅降低了计算开销。

Abstract: Modern language models operate on subword-tokenized text in order to make a
trade-off between model size, inference speed, and vocabulary coverage. A side
effect of this is that, during inference, models are evaluated by measuring the
probability of only the specific tokenization produced as the output, despite
there being many possible ways to represent the same text with a subword
vocabulary. Recent studies have argued instead for evaluating LLMs by
marginalization - the probability mass of all tokenizations of a given text.
  Marginalization is difficult due to the number of possible tokenizations of a
text, so often approximate marginalization is done via sampling. However, a
downside of sampling is that an expensive generation step must be performed by
the LLM for each sample, which limits the number of samples that can be
acquired given a runtime budget, and therefore also the accuracy of the
approximation. Since computing the probability of a sequence given the
tokenization is relatively cheap compared to actually generating it, we
investigate sampling strategies that are decoding-free - they require no
generation from the LLM, instead relying entirely on extremely cheap sampling
strategies that are model and tokenizer agnostic.
  We investigate the approximation quality and speed of decoding-free sampling
strategies for a number of open models to find that they provide sufficiently
accurate marginal estimates at a small fraction of the runtime cost and
demonstrate its use on a set of downstream inference tasks.

*Filippo Cenacchi,Deborah Richards,Longbing Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种三模态情感严重程度框架，通过融合文本、音频和面部信号来评估抑郁症和PTSD的严重程度，优于单模态方法，在噪声或缺失模态下表现更稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁症和PTSD常共病且症状相关，但现有自动评估方法多为二元分类且针对单一障碍。临床需要能够提供严重程度分级、跨障碍评估和决策支持解释的诊断工具。

Method: 统一的三模态情感严重程度框架，同步融合：1) 访谈文本（句子级transformer嵌入）2) 音频（log Mel统计特征和delta）3) 面部信号（动作单元、注视、头部和姿态描述符）。使用校准的后期融合分类器输出分级严重程度。

Result: 在DAIC数据集上的分层交叉验证显示：融合模型在准确率和加权F1上与最强单模态基线相当，但提高了决策曲线效用和在噪声/缺失模态下的鲁棒性。对PTSD特别减少了回归误差并改善了类别一致性。错误主要集中在相邻严重程度之间，极端类别识别可靠。

Conclusion: 该方法为情感临床决策提供了可重复评估和临床医生在环支持，文本对抑郁症严重程度贡献最大，音频和面部线索对PTSD至关重要，归因分析与语言和行为标记一致。

Abstract: Depression and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often co-occur with
connected symptoms, complicating automated assessment, which is often binary
and disorder specific. Clinically useful diagnosis needs severity aware cross
disorder estimates and decision support explanations. Our unified tri modal
affective severity framework synchronizes and fuses interview text with
sentence level transformer embeddings, audio with log Mel statistics with
deltas, and facial signals with action units, gaze, head and pose descriptors
to output graded severities for diagnosing both depression (PHQ-8; 5 classes)
and PTSD (3 classes). Standardized features are fused via a calibrated late
fusion classifier, yielding per disorder probabilities and feature-level
attributions. This severity aware tri-modal affective fusion approach is demoed
on multi disorder concurrent depression and PTSD assessment. Stratified cross
validation on DAIC derived corpora outperforms unimodal/ablation baselines. The
fused model matches the strongest unimodal baseline on accuracy and weighted
F1, while improving decision curve utility and robustness under noisy or
missing modalities. For PTSD specifically, fusion reduces regression error and
improves class concordance. Errors cluster between adjacent severities; extreme
classes are identified reliably. Ablations show text contributes most to
depression severity, audio and facial cues are critical for PTSD, whereas
attributions align with linguistic and behavioral markers. Our approach offers
reproducible evaluation and clinician in the loop support for affective
clinical decision making.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ContextLM框架通过引入next-context预测目标来增强标准预训练，克服了传统next-token预测在捕捉高级语义结构和长距离上下文关系方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的next-token预测限制了模型捕捉高级语义结构和长距离上下文关系的能力，需要一种能够学习多token上下文预测表示的方法。

Method: 在标准预训练基础上增加next-context预测目标，利用未来token块产生的错误信号来训练模型学习多token上下文的预测表示，同时保持与标准自回归评估范式的完全兼容。

Result: 在GPT2和Pythia模型家族上的实验表明，ContextLM在困惑度和下游任务性能上均带来一致改进，最高扩展到15亿参数规模。

Conclusion: next-context预测为更强的语言建模提供了可扩展且高效的途径，能够以最小的计算开销获得更好的长距离连贯性和更有效的注意力分配。

Abstract: Next-token prediction (NTP) is the cornerstone of modern large language
models (LLMs) pretraining, driving their unprecedented capabilities in text
generation, reasoning, and instruction following. However, the token-level
prediction limits the model's capacity to capture higher-level semantic
structures and long-range contextual relationships. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce \textbf{ContextLM}, a framework that augments standard
pretraining with an inherent \textbf{next-context prediction} objective. This
mechanism trains the model to learn predictive representations of multi-token
contexts, leveraging error signals derived from future token chunks. Crucially,
ContextLM achieves this enhancement while remaining fully compatible with the
standard autoregressive, token-by-token evaluation paradigm (e.g., perplexity).
Extensive experiments on the GPT2 and Pythia model families, scaled up to
$1.5$B parameters, show that ContextLM delivers consistent improvements in both
perplexity and downstream task performance. Our analysis indicates that
next-context prediction provides a scalable and efficient pathway to stronger
language modeling, yielding better long-range coherence and more effective
attention allocation with minimal computational overhead.

TL;DR: 该论文提出将引用失败与响应失败分离，并开发了CITECONTROL基准来研究引用失败的原因，以及CITENTION框架来改善LLM引用性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的RAG系统虽然提供引用功能，但存在引用失败问题——模型生成有用响应但未能完整引用证据。需要将引用失败与响应失败区分开来单独解决。

Method: 采用两步法：1) 通过CITECONTROL基准系统分析响应与证据关系对引用质量的影响；2) 提出CITENTION框架，集成生成式、基于注意力和基于检索的方法来改善引用。

Result: 实验表明引用失败随关系复杂性增加而增加，CITENTION框架在CITECONTROL基准和迁移设置中都显著提升了引用性能。

Conclusion: 区分引用失败与响应失败是必要的，CITENTION框架能有效改善LLM的引用能力，为RAG系统的引用可靠性提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Citations from LLM-based RAG systems are supposed to simplify response
verification. However, this does not hold for citation failure, when a model
generates a helpful response, but fails to cite complete evidence. In contrast
to previous work, we propose to disentangle this from response failure, where
the response itself is flawed, and citing complete evidence is impossible. To
address citation failure, this work follows a two-step approach: (1) We study
when citation failure occurs and (2) how it can be mitigated. For step 1, we
extend prior work by investigating how the relation between response and
evidence affects citation quality. We introduce CITECONTROL, a benchmark that
systematically varies this relation to analyze failure modes. Experiments show
that failures increase with relational complexity and suggest that combining
citation methods could improve performance, motivating step 2. To improve LLM
citation efficiently, we propose CITENTION, a framework integrating generative,
attention-based, and retrieval-based methods. Results demonstrate substantial
citation improvements on CITECONTROL and in transfer settings. We make our data
and code publicly available.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究过程奖励模型（PRMs）在表格问答（TQA）任务中的应用，发现结合文本和代码验证的PRMs能帮助选择解决方案，但在领域外数据上泛化能力不足，且步骤级验证与答案准确性相关性较弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然PRMs在数学等领域能通过逐步评分提升复杂推理能力，但在涉及半结构化数据的表格问答任务中的应用尚未探索。TQA面临信息冗余、推理步骤松散和领域特定推理等独特挑战。

Method: 从答案和步骤两个角度评估最先进的生成式PRMs在TQA上的表现，分析文本和代码验证的结合效果。

Result: 结果显示：结合文本和代码验证的PRMs能辅助解决方案选择，但在领域外数据上泛化困难；步骤级验证性能与答案准确性相关性较弱，可能源于步骤依赖性和因果联系薄弱。

Conclusion: 当前PRMs在TQA任务中存在局限性，研究结果为构建更鲁棒的过程感知验证器提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) improve complex reasoning in large language
models (LLMs) by grading candidate solutions step-by-step and selecting answers
via aggregated step scores. While effective in domains such as mathematics,
their applicability to tasks involving semi-structured data, like table
question answering (TQA) remains unexplored. TQA poses unique challenges for
PRMs, including abundant irrelevant information, loosely connected reasoning
steps, and domain-specific reasoning. This work presents the first systematic
study of PRMs for TQA. We evaluate state-of-the-art generative PRMs on TQA from
both answer and step perspectives. Results show that PRMs that combine textual
and code verification can aid solution selection but struggle to generalize to
out-of-domain data. Analysis reveals a weak correlation between performance in
step-level verification and answer accuracy, possibly stemming from weak step
dependencies and loose causal links. Our findings highlight limitations of
current PRMs on TQA and offer valuable insights for building more robust,
process-aware verifiers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在处理复杂数学运算时存在效率低下和准确性不足的问题，而集成代码解释器时又会产生概率推理与确定性知识之间的冲突，导致无效的思考循环。

Method: 提出CoRT框架，采用提示工程策略在推理路径的关键点注入多样化提示，生成高质量的代码集成推理数据，并通过监督微调、拒绝采样和强化学习来优化模型与代码解释器的交互。

Result: 在五个挑战性数学推理数据集上，DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B和1.5B模型分别获得4%和8%的绝对提升，同时显著减少token使用量（32B模型约30%，1.5B模型约50%）。

Conclusion: CoRT框架有效解决了大型推理模型与代码解释器集成时的冲突问题，显著提升了数学推理的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI-o1 have shown impressive
capabilities in natural language reasoning. However, these models frequently
demonstrate inefficiencies or inaccuracies when tackling complex mathematical
operations. While integrating computational tools such as Code Interpreters
(CIs) offers a promising solution, it introduces a critical challenge: a
conflict between the model's internal, probabilistic reasoning and the
external, deterministic knowledge provided by the CI, which often leads models
to unproductive deliberation. To overcome this, we introduce CoRT
(Code-Optimized Reasoning Training), a post-training framework designed to
teach LRMs to effectively utilize CIs. We propose \emph{Hint-Engineering}, a
new data synthesis strategy that strategically injects diverse hints at optimal
points within reasoning paths. This approach generates high-quality,
code-integrated reasoning data specifically tailored to optimize LRM-CI
interaction. Using this method, we have synthesized 30 high-quality samples to
post-train models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters through supervised
fine-tuning. CoRT further refines the multi-round interleaving of external CI
usage and internal thinking by employing rejection sampling and reinforcement
learning. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate CoRT's effectiveness,
yielding absolute improvements of 4\% and 8\% on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B
and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, respectively, across five challenging
mathematical reasoning datasets. Moreover, CoRT significantly enhances
efficiency, reducing token usage by approximately 30\% for the 32B model and
50\% for the 1.5B model compared to pure natural language reasoning baselines.

TL;DR: LLMs在表格推理任务中的表现可能受到数据集污染的影响，当数据集包含语义线索时性能良好，但去除这些线索后性能降至随机水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在结构化数据上的推理能力时，往往忽略了数据集污染这一重要混淆因素。

Method: 通过一系列受控探测实验，研究LLMs是否对广泛使用的表格基准数据集存在先验知识。

Result: 仅当数据集包含强语义线索时才会出现污染效应，去除这些线索后性能急剧下降至接近随机水平。

Conclusion: LLMs在表格推理任务中的明显能力可能部分反映了对公开数据集的记忆而非真正的泛化能力，需要改进评估协议来区分语义泄漏和真实推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on their ability to
reason over structured data, yet such assessments often overlook a crucial
confound: dataset contamination. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs
exhibit prior knowledge of widely used tabular benchmarks such as Adult Income,
Titanic, and others. Through a series of controlled probing experiments, we
reveal that contamination effects emerge exclusively for datasets containing
strong semantic cues-for instance, meaningful column names or interpretable
value categories. In contrast, when such cues are removed or randomized,
performance sharply declines to near-random levels. These findings suggest that
LLMs' apparent competence on tabular reasoning tasks may, in part, reflect
memorization of publicly available datasets rather than genuine generalization.
We discuss implications for evaluation protocols and propose strategies to
disentangle semantic leakage from authentic reasoning ability in future LLM
assessments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分块方法采用固定粒度范式，依赖静态边界识别，限制了其对多样化查询需求的适应性。

Method: 将句子作为原子单位，从静态分块分割转向支持任意句子组合的灵活检索，减少语义边界检测的计算开销。

Result: 在LongBench V2上的实验评估显示，FreeChunker相比传统分块方法实现了更优的检索性能，并在计算效率上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FreeChunker通过范式转变，在减少计算开销的同时增强了复杂查询的适应性，为RAG系统提供了更有效的分块策略。

Abstract: Chunking strategies significantly impact the effectiveness of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Existing methods operate within
fixed-granularity paradigms that rely on static boundary identification,
limiting their adaptability to diverse query requirements. This paper presents
FreeChunker, a Cross-Granularity Encoding Framework that fundamentally
transforms the traditional chunking paradigm: the framework treats sentences as
atomic units and shifts from static chunk segmentation to flexible retrieval
supporting arbitrary sentence combinations. This paradigm shift not only
significantly reduces the computational overhead required for semantic boundary
detection but also enhances adaptability to complex queries. Experimental
evaluation on LongBench V2 demonstrates that FreeChunker achieves superior
retrieval performance compared to traditional chunking methods, while
significantly outperforming existing approaches in computational efficiency.

Method: 基于对话数据预训练的llamalogue模型，采用多种微调策略（包括PPO和DPO）来增强模型的对话生成能力。

Result: 模型在大多数标准BabyLM基准测试中表现不佳，但在最小对设置中的对话延续预测方面表现优异；PPO微调效果不一甚至有害，而DPO微调能进一步提升自定义对话基准的性能。

Abstract: Recent studies on hallucination in large language models (LLMs) have been
actively progressing in natural language processing. However, the impact of
negated text on hallucination with LLMs remains largely unexplored. In this
paper, we set three important yet unanswered research questions and aim to
address them. To derive the answers, we investigate whether LLMs can recognize
contextual shifts caused by negation and still reliably distinguish
hallucinations comparable to affirmative cases. We also design the NegHalu
dataset by reconstructing existing hallucination detection datasets with
negated expressions. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs struggle to detect
hallucinations in negated text effectively, often producing logically
inconsistent or unfaithful judgments. Moreover, we trace the internal state of
LLMs as they process negated inputs at the token level and reveal the
challenges of mitigating their unintended effects.

*Shaltiel Shmidman,Avi Shmidman,Moshe Koppel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了NeoDictaBERT和NeoDictaBERT-bilingual两个BERT风格模型，专门针对希伯来语文本优化，在希伯来语基准测试中表现优异，特别是在检索任务上超越同规模多语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的BERT模型架构已过时，需要更新以适应现代transformer架构（如Llama3、Qwen3）的优势。ModernBERT和NeoBERT在英语任务上已有成功改进，但希伯来语领域仍缺乏类似优化模型。

Method: 采用与NeoBERT相同的架构训练BERT风格模型，专门针对希伯来语文本进行优化，开发了单语（NeoDictaBERT）和双语（NeoDictaBERT-bilingual）版本。

Result: 新模型在几乎所有希伯来语基准测试中超越现有模型，双语版本在检索任务上表现尤其突出，优于同规模多语言模型。

Conclusion: NeoDictaBERT系列模型为希伯来语NLP提供了强大基础，推动了希伯来语研究和开发，模型已向社区发布。

Abstract: Since their initial release, BERT models have demonstrated exceptional
performance on a variety of tasks, despite their relatively small size
(BERT-base has ~100M parameters). Nevertheless, the architectural choices used
in these models are outdated compared to newer transformer-based models such as
Llama3 and Qwen3. In recent months, several architectures have been proposed to
close this gap. ModernBERT and NeoBERT both show strong improvements on English
benchmarks and significantly extend the supported context window. Following
their successes, we introduce NeoDictaBERT and NeoDictaBERT-bilingual:
BERT-style models trained using the same architecture as NeoBERT, with a
dedicated focus on Hebrew texts. These models outperform existing ones on
almost all Hebrew benchmarks and provide a strong foundation for downstream
tasks. Notably, the NeoDictaBERT-bilingual model shows strong results on
retrieval tasks, outperforming other multilingual models of similar size. In
this paper, we describe the training process and report results across various
benchmarks. We release the models to the community as part of our goal to
advance research and development in Hebrew NLP.

TL;DR: ContingentChat是一个教师-学生框架，通过在100M词汇的BabyLM上进行后训练，提升多轮对话的连续性，使生成的回复更加语法正确和连贯。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 儿童与照顾者之间的多轮对话具有连续性特征，即对话者之间及时、直接且有意义的交流。本文旨在评估和改进BabyLM在多轮对话中的连续性表现。

Method: 提出ContingentChat教师-学生框架，使用新颖的对齐数据集进行后训练，并实验了自适应教师解码策略。

Result: BabyLM生成的回复在语法和连贯性方面有所改善，但自适应教师解码策略带来的额外增益有限。

Conclusion: ContingentChat证明了针对性后训练对对话质量的益处，同时表明连续性对于BabyLM来说仍然是一个具有挑战性的目标。

Abstract: Multi-turn dialogues between a child and a caregiver are characterized by a
property called contingency - that is, prompt, direct, and meaningful exchanges
between interlocutors. We introduce ContingentChat, a teacher-student framework
that benchmarks and improves multi-turn contingency in a BabyLM trained on 100M
words. Using a novel alignment dataset for post-training, BabyLM generates
responses that are more grammatical and cohesive. Experiments with adaptive
teacher decoding strategies show limited additional gains. ContingentChat
demonstrates the benefits of targeted post-training for dialogue quality and
indicates that contingency remains a challenging goal for BabyLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了指令蒸馏任务和LM-Mixup方法，通过将低质量指令数据蒸馏为高质量指令-输出对，仅使用3%的数据就能超越全数据集训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量指令调优数据稀缺，而大量低质量数据被丢弃造成信息损失。现有数据增强方法难以有效利用低质量数据，且评估标准不明确。

Method: 构建MIXTURE数据集（14.4万样本），提出LM-Mixup方法：先在MIXTURE上进行监督微调，然后通过强化学习优化，使用质量、语义对齐和格式合规三个奖励信号。

Result: 仅使用3%的蒸馏数据微调LLM，不仅超越全数据集训练，还能与最先进的高质量数据选择方法竞争多个基准测试。

Conclusion: 低质量数据是宝贵资源，通过LM-Mixup适当蒸馏和增强，能显著提升指令调优LLM的效率和性能。

Abstract: Instruction tuning is crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs), yet
the quality of instruction-following data varies significantly. While
high-quality data is paramount, it is often scarce; conversely, abundant
low-quality data is frequently discarded, leading to substantial information
loss. Existing data augmentation methods struggle to augment this low-quality
data effectively, and the evaluation of such techniques remains poorly defined.
To address this, we formally define the task of Instruction Distillation:
distilling multiple low-quality and redundant inputs into high-quality and
coherent instruction-output pairs. Specifically, we introduce a comprehensive
data construction pipeline to create MIXTURE, a 144K-sample dataset pairing
low-quality or semantically redundant imperfect instruction clusters with their
high-quality distillations. We then introduce LM-Mixup, by first performing
supervised fine-tuning on MIXTURE and then optimizing it with reinforcement
learning. This process uses three complementary reward signals: quality,
semantic alignment, and format compliance, via Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). We demonstrate that LM-Mixup effectively augments
imperfect datasets: fine-tuning LLMs on its distilled data, which accounts for
only about 3% of the entire dataset, not only surpasses full-dataset training
but also competes with state-of-the-art high-quality data selection methods
across multiple benchmarks. Our work establishes that low-quality data is a
valuable resource when properly distilled and augmented with LM-Mixup,
significantly enhancing the efficiency and performance of instruction-tuned
LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的输出存在不同程度的不确定性和正确性，实际可靠性无法保证，需要量化这种不确定性来提升模型应用的可靠性。

Method: 在四个问答任务上使用最先进的开源LLM，系统评估四种置信度估计方法：VCE、MSP、样本一致性和CoCoA。

Result: 每种不确定性指标捕捉模型置信度的不同方面，混合CoCoA方法在可靠性和答案区分度方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: 讨论了各种方法的权衡，并为LLM应用中选择不确定性度量提供了建议。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) produce outputs with varying levels of
uncertainty, and, just as often, varying levels of correctness; making their
practical reliability far from guaranteed. To quantify this uncertainty, we
systematically evaluate four approaches for confidence estimation in LLM
outputs: VCE, MSP, Sample Consistency, and CoCoA (Vashurin et al., 2025). For
the evaluation of the approaches, we conduct experiments on four
question-answering tasks using a state-of-the-art open-source LLM. Our results
show that each uncertainty metric captures a different facet of model
confidence and that the hybrid CoCoA approach yields the best reliability
overall, improving both calibration and discrimination of correct answers. We
discuss the trade-offs of each method and provide recommendations for selecting
uncertainty measures in LLM applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现大语言模型的内部表征可作为学习知识的可靠代理，旨在解决持续学习中无需访问历史数据的问题，避免灾难性遗忘。

Method: 基于聚类典型样本计算层间隐藏表征的相似性，进行自适应、分层的参数融合，浅层保留领域通用特征，深层允许任务特定适应。

Result: 在五个NLP任务和多种持续学习场景中，RECALL在知识保留和泛化方面均优于基线方法，实现了无缝多领域集成。

Conclusion: RECALL提供了一个可扩展且无需数据的解决方案，用于持续演进大语言模型，有效抵抗灾难性遗忘。

Abstract: We unveil that internal representations in large language models (LLMs) serve
as reliable proxies of learned knowledge, and propose RECALL, a novel
representation-aware model merging framework for continual learning without
access to historical data. RECALL computes inter-model similarity from
layer-wise hidden representations over clustered typical samples, and performs
adaptive, hierarchical parameter fusion to align knowledge across models. This
design enables the preservation of domain-general features in shallow layers
while allowing task-specific adaptation in deeper layers. Unlike prior methods
that require task labels or incur performance trade-offs, RECALL achieves
seamless multi-domain integration and strong resistance to catastrophic
forgetting. Extensive experiments across five NLP tasks and multiple continual
learning scenarios show that RECALL outperforms baselines in both knowledge
retention and generalization, providing a scalable and data-free solution for
evolving LLMs.

TL;DR: 通过向LLM的激活状态添加导向向量，可以抑制模型在评估时的警觉行为，使其表现得像在部署环境中一样，从而提高安全评估的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在评估时能够检测到被测试的情况，并调整行为以显得更加对齐，这会损害安全评估的可靠性。

Method: 使用两阶段训练过程创建评估警觉模型：首先在包含模型事实描述的文档上进行持续预训练，然后通过专家迭代训练模型在评估环境中使用Python类型提示。最后通过激活导向技术抑制评估警觉行为。

Result: 研究发现激活导向能够有效抑制评估警觉，使模型在存在评估线索时表现得像在部署环境中一样。

Conclusion: AI评估者可以通过导向技术使模型表现得像在部署环境中，从而提高安全评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes detect when they are being
evaluated and adjust their behavior to appear more aligned, compromising the
reliability of safety evaluations. In this paper, we show that adding a
steering vector to an LLM's activations can suppress evaluation-awareness and
make the model act like it is deployed during evaluation. To study our steering
technique, we train an LLM to exhibit evaluation-aware behavior using a
two-step training process designed to mimic how this behavior could emerge
naturally. First, we perform continued pretraining on documents with factual
descriptions of the model (1) using Python type hints during evaluation but not
during deployment and (2) recognizing that the presence of a certain evaluation
cue always means that it is being tested. Then, we train the model with expert
iteration to use Python type hints in evaluation settings. The resulting model
is evaluation-aware: it writes type hints in evaluation contexts more than
deployment contexts. However, this gap can only be observed by removing the
evaluation cue. We find that activation steering can suppress evaluation
awareness and make the model act like it is deployed even when the cue is
present. Importantly, we constructed our steering vector using the original
model before our additional training. Our results suggest that AI evaluators
could improve the reliability of safety evaluations by steering models to act
like they are deployed.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Robust Preference Selection (RPS)方法，通过方向性邻域共识来解决LLM偏好覆盖不足的问题，无需重新训练即可提升模型对多样化偏好的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在训练数据中反映的主流偏好上表现良好，但在偏离训练数据中心趋势的特定、个体需求上表现不佳，存在偏好覆盖差距。现有方法通常需要昂贵的重新训练，且难以泛化到完整的多样化偏好谱系。

Method: RPS是一种后处理、无需训练的方法，利用方向性邻域共识。它从相关偏好的局部邻域中采样多个响应来创建候选池，然后选择与用户原始意图最匹配的响应。

Result: 在三种不同对齐范式（DPA、DPO和SFT）上的综合实验表明，RPS始终比基线方法更鲁棒，在空间欠表示区域的挑战性偏好上实现了高达69%的胜率，且无需模型重新训练。

Conclusion: RPS提供了一个实用、理论基础扎实的解决方案，用于增强偏好对齐模型的可靠性，有效解决了LLM在多样化偏好上的覆盖不足问题。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human preferences is critical for
creating reliable and controllable AI systems. A human preference can be
visualized as a high-dimensional vector where different directions represent
trade-offs between desired attributes (e.g., helpfulness vs. verbosity). Yet,
because the training data often reflects dominant, average preferences, LLMs
tend to perform well on common requests but fall short in specific, individual
needs. This mismatch creates a preference coverage gap. Existing methods often
address this through costly retraining, which may not be generalized to the
full spectrum of diverse preferences. This brittleness means that when a user's
request reflects a nuanced preference deviating from the training data's
central tendency, model performance can degrade unpredictably. To address this
challenge, we introduce Robust Preference Selection (RPS), a post-hoc,
training-free method by leveraging directional neighborhood consensus. Instead
of forcing a model to generate a response from a single, highly specific
preference, RPS samples multiple responses from a local neighborhood of related
preferences to create a superior candidate pool. It then selects the response
that best aligns with the user's original intent. We provide a theoretical
framework showing our neighborhood generation strategy is provably superior to
a strong baseline that also samples multiple candidates. Comprehensive
experiments across three distinct alignment paradigms (DPA, DPO, and SFT)
demonstrate that RPS consistently improves robustness against this baseline,
achieving win rates of up to 69% on challenging preferences from
under-represented regions of the space without any model retraining. Our work
presents a practical, theoretically-grounded solution for enhancing the
reliability of preference-aligned models.

Motivation: 解决检索增强生成在多步问题和异构证据源上的脆弱性，平衡准确性、延迟和计算资源消耗

Method: 将文档、表格和知识图谱线性化为可逆层次序列，通过头代理指导检索，迭代代理执行结构感知操作，最后合成规范化证据生成答案

Result: 在HotpotQA、HybridQA/TAT-QA和MetaQA数据集上，相比单次检索、多跳和代理式RAG基线，实现了EM/F1指标的持续提升，同时保持高效率

Conclusion: HSEQ框架具有格式无关的统一性、预算感知的迭代和证据规范化三大优势，能够跨文本、表格和知识图谱操作，减少不必要跳转和计算开销，提高答案一致性和可审计性

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains brittle on multi-step questions
and heterogeneous evidence sources, trading accuracy against latency and
token/tool budgets. This paper introducesHierarchical Sequence (HSEQ) Iteration
for Heterogeneous Question Answering, a unified framework that (i) linearize
documents, tables, and knowledge graphs into a reversible hierarchical sequence
with lightweight structural tags, and (ii) perform structure-aware iteration to
collect just-enough evidence before answer synthesis. A Head Agent provides
guidance that leads retrieval, while an Iteration Agent selects and expands
HSeq via structure-respecting actions (e.g., parent/child hops, table
row/column neighbors, KG relations); Finally the head agent composes
canonicalized evidence to genearte the final answer, with an optional
refinement loop to resolve detected contradictions. Experiments on HotpotQA
(text), HybridQA/TAT-QA (table+text), and MetaQA (KG) show consistent EM/F1
gains over strong single-pass, multi-hop, and agentic RAG baselines with high
efficiency. Besides, HSEQ exhibits three key advantages: (1) a format-agnostic
unification that enables a single policy to operate across text, tables, and
KGs without per-dataset specialization; (2) guided, budget-aware iteration that
reduces unnecessary hops, tool calls, and tokens while preserving accuracy; and
(3) evidence canonicalization for reliable QA, improving answers consistency
and auditability.

Motivation: 传统上通过英文调查评估LLM政治偏见存在局限，需要基于多语言翻译公平性原则的替代框架来更全面地分析政治偏见。

Method: 构建了包含政治派别信息的21种语言多平行版本EuroParl数据集，系统比较欧洲议会演讲的翻译质量，分析不同政治派别间的差异。

Result: 发现主流政党（左翼、中间、右翼）的演讲翻译质量显著优于边缘政党，揭示了LLM在政治翻译中的系统性偏见。

Conclusion: 多语言翻译公平性框架能有效揭示LLM的政治偏见，为偏见评估提供了新的视角和方法论。

Abstract: The political biases of Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually assessed by
simulating their answers to English surveys. In this work, we propose an
alternative framing of political biases, relying on principles of fairness in
multilingual translation. We systematically compare the translation quality of
speeches in the European Parliament (EP), observing systematic differences with
majority parties from left, center, and right being better translated than
outsider parties. This study is made possible by a new, 21-way multiparallel
version of EuroParl, the parliamentary proceedings of the EP, which includes
the political affiliations of each speaker. The dataset consists of 1.5M
sentences for a total of 40M words and 249M characters. It covers three years,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强生成和思维链推理等技术导致上下文变长和推理成本增加。现有上下文压缩方法需要微调目标模型或修改架构，这会损害模型的通用能力。

Method: 设计ARC-Encoder编码器，系统研究训练策略和架构选择，将上下文压缩为比文本token少4-8倍的连续表示，用于替换解码器LLM中的token嵌入。

Result: ARC-Encoder在多个LLM使用场景中实现最先进性能，包括上下文学习和上下文窗口扩展，同时提高推理计算效率。

Conclusion: ARC-Encoder是灵活高效的便携式编码器解决方案，可适配多个解码器LLM，实现跨模型泛化。

Abstract: Recent techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation or chain-of-thought
reasoning have led to longer contexts and increased inference costs. Context
compression techniques can reduce these costs, but the most effective
approaches require fine-tuning the target model or even modifying its
architecture. This can degrade its general abilities when not used for this
specific purpose. Here we explore an alternative approach: an encoder that
compresses the context into continuous representations which replace token
embeddings in decoder LLMs. First, we perform a systematic study of training
strategies and architecture choices for the encoder. Our findings led to the
design of an Adaptable text Representations Compressor, named ARC-Encoder,
which outputs $x$-times fewer continuous representations (typically
$x\!\in\!\{4,8\}$) than text tokens. We evaluate ARC-Encoder across a variety
of LLM usage scenarios, ranging from in-context learning to context window
extension, on both instruct and base decoders. Results show that ARC-Encoder
achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks while improving
computational efficiency at inference. Finally, we demonstrate that our models
can be adapted to multiple decoders simultaneously, allowing a single encoder
to generalize across different decoder LLMs. This makes ARC-Encoder a flexible
and efficient solution for portable encoders that work seamlessly with multiple
LLMs. We release a training code at https://github.com/kyutai-labs/ARC-Encoder

TL;DR: CenterBench是一个包含9720个理解问题的数据集，专门测试语言模型对中心嵌套句子的理解能力，旨在区分模型是进行结构分析还是语义模式匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏区分语言模型结构理解和语义模式匹配的方法，需要开发能够量化模型何时从结构分析转向语义关联的评估框架。

Method: 使用中心嵌套句子构建数据集，包含语法相同但语义不可信的对立句子，通过六种理解问题测试表面理解、句法依赖和因果推理能力。

Result: 测试六个模型发现，随着复杂度增加，可信与不可信句子之间的性能差距系统性地扩大（中位数差距达26.8个百分点），模型在复杂情况下会放弃结构分析而依赖语义关联。

Conclusion: CenterBench提供了首个识别模型何时从结构分析转向模式匹配的框架，发现语义可信性在因果推理问题中反而损害性能，推理模型虽然提高准确性但仍存在语义捷径等问题。

Abstract: When language models correctly parse "The cat that the dog chased meowed,"
are they analyzing syntax or simply familiar with dogs chasing cats? Despite
extensive benchmarking, we lack methods to distinguish structural understanding
from semantic pattern matching. We introduce CenterBench, a dataset of 9,720
comprehension questions on center-embedded sentences (like "The cat [that the
dog chased] meowed") where relative clauses nest recursively, creating
processing demands from simple to deeply nested structures. Each sentence has a
syntactically identical but semantically implausible counterpart (e.g., mailmen
prescribe medicine, doctors deliver mail) and six comprehension questions
testing surface understanding, syntactic dependencies, and causal reasoning.
Testing six models reveals that performance gaps between plausible and
implausible sentences widen systematically with complexity, with models showing
median gaps up to 26.8 percentage points, quantifying when they abandon
structural analysis for semantic associations. Notably, semantic plausibility
harms performance on questions about resulting actions, where following causal
relationships matters more than semantic coherence. Reasoning models improve
accuracy but their traces show semantic shortcuts, overthinking, and answer
refusal. Unlike models whose plausibility advantage systematically widens with
complexity, humans shows variable semantic effects. CenterBench provides the
first framework to identify when models shift from structural analysis to
pattern matching.

TL;DR: GlobalRAG是一个强化学习框架，通过分解问题为子目标、协调检索与推理、迭代优化证据来解决多跳问答中的全局规划缺失和不忠实执行问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习在多跳问答中效果有限，主要因为缺乏全局规划来组织多步推理，以及不忠实的执行阻碍了有效查询制定和检索证据的一致使用。

Method: 提出GlobalRAG框架，将问题分解为子目标，协调检索与推理，迭代优化证据。引入规划质量奖励和子目标完成奖励来指导过程，并使用渐进权重退火策略平衡过程导向和结果导向目标。

Result: 在领域内和领域外基准测试中，GlobalRAG显著优于强基线，仅使用8k训练数据（基线训练数据的42%），在EM和F1指标上平均提升14.2%。

Conclusion: GlobalRAG通过强化学习有效增强了多跳问答中的全局推理能力，在减少训练数据需求的同时实现了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently shown promise in improving
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite these advances, its effectiveness
in multi-hop question answering (QA) remains limited by two fundamental
limitations: (i) global planning absence to structure multi-step reasoning, and
(ii) unfaithful execution, which hinders effective query formulation and
consistent use of retrieved evidence. We propose GlobalRAG, a reinforcement
learning framework designed to enhance global reasoning in multi-hop QA.
GlobalRAG decomposes questions into subgoals, coordinates retrieval with
reasoning, and refines evidence iteratively. To guide this process, we
introduce Planning Quality Reward and SubGoal Completion Reward, which
encourage coherent planning and reliable subgoal execution. In addition, a
progressive weight annealing strategy balances process-oriented and
outcome-based objectives. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and
out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that GlobalRAG significantly outperforms
strong baselines while using only 8k training data (42% of the training data
used by strong baselines), achieving average improvements of 14.2% in both EM
and F1.

Motivation: 传统检索-排序范式与用户多阶段认知决策过程存在根本性不匹配，导致语义鸿沟、高决策成本和缺乏专业购物指导等问题

Method: 采用多智能体认知决策框架，从被动检索转向主动决策支持

Result: 离线评估显示在推荐准确性和用户满意度方面显著提升，特别是在涉及否定、多约束或推理需求的复杂查询中；在线A/B测试证实了实际效果

Conclusion: 多智能体认知系统在重新定义电商搜索方面具有变革性潜力

Abstract: The retrieval-ranking paradigm has long dominated e-commerce search, but its
reliance on query-item matching fundamentally misaligns with multi-stage
cognitive decision processes of platform users. This misalignment introduces
critical limitations: semantic gaps in complex queries, high decision costs due
to cross-platform information foraging, and the absence of professional
shopping guidance. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Agent Cognitive
Decision Framework (MACDF), which shifts the paradigm from passive retrieval to
proactive decision support. Extensive offline evaluations demonstrate MACDF's
significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction,
particularly for complex queries involving negation, multi-constraint, or
reasoning demands. Online A/B testing on JD search platform confirms its
practical efficacy. This work highlights the transformative potential of
multi-agent cognitive systems in redefining e-commerce search.

### [136] [Can ChatGPT Code Communication Data Fairly?: Empirical Evidence from Multiple Collaborative Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20584)
*Jiangang Hao,Wenju Cui,Patrick Kyllonen,Emily Kerzabi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了ChatGPT在通信数据自动编码中是否存在性别和种族偏见，发现在协作问题解决任务中无显著偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大规模通信协作需要人工编码通信数据，虽然ChatGPT可直接根据编码规则进行编码且准确率接近人类评分者，但其是否存在针对不同人口群体（如性别和种族）的偏见尚不明确。

Method: 使用典型的协作问题解决编码框架，基于ChatGPT对三种协作任务（谈判、问题解决和决策制定）的通信数据进行自动编码，分析不同性别和种族群体间的差异。

Result: 结果显示，基于ChatGPT的编码在性别和种族群体间未表现出显著偏见。

Conclusion: ChatGPT在协作和通信的大规模评估中无显著人口偏见，为其应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Assessing communication and collaboration at scale depends on a labor
intensive task of coding communication data into categories according to
different frameworks. Prior research has established that ChatGPT can be
directly instructed with coding rubrics to code the communication data and
achieves accuracy comparable to human raters. However, whether the coding from
ChatGPT or similar AI technology exhibits bias against different demographic
groups, such as gender and race, remains unclear. To fill this gap, this paper
investigates ChatGPT-based automated coding of communication data using a
typical coding framework for collaborative problem solving, examining
differences across gender and racial groups. The analysis draws on data from
three types of collaborative tasks: negotiation, problem solving, and decision
making. Our results show that ChatGPT-based coding exhibits no significant bias
across gender and racial groups, paving the road for its adoption in
large-scale assessment of collaboration and communication.

TL;DR: 本文基于人类好奇心评估问卷5DCR，设计了一个评估框架来评估大语言模型的好奇心程度，发现LLMs比人类有更强的求知欲但在不确定环境中仍趋于保守，好奇行为能增强模型的推理和主动学习能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型是否具备类似人类的好奇心驱动学习能力，从人类好奇心评估问卷出发设计评估框架。

Method: 基于五维好奇心量表修订版(5DCR)设计评估框架，涵盖信息寻求、刺激寻求、社交好奇心等维度，评估LLMs的好奇心表现。

Result: LLMs表现出比人类更强的知识渴求，但在面对不确定环境时仍趋于保守；好奇行为能增强模型的推理和主动学习能力。

Conclusion: LLMs有潜力展现类似人类的好奇心，为未来LLMs学习能力和创新研究的发展提供了实验支持。

Abstract: Curiosity serves as a pivotal conduit for human beings to discover and learn
new knowledge. Recent advancements of large language models (LLMs) in natural
language processing have sparked discussions regarding whether these models
possess capability of curiosity-driven learning akin to humans. In this paper,
starting from the human curiosity assessment questionnaire Five-Dimensional
Curiosity scale Revised (5DCR), we design a comprehensive evaluation framework
that covers dimensions such as Information Seeking, Thrill Seeking, and Social
Curiosity to assess the extent of curiosity exhibited by LLMs. The results
demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a stronger thirst for knowledge than humans but
still tend to make conservative choices when faced with uncertain environments.
We further investigated the relationship between curiosity and thinking of
LLMs, confirming that curious behaviors can enhance the model's reasoning and
active learning abilities. These findings suggest that LLMs have the potential
to exhibit curiosity similar to that of humans, providing experimental support
for the future development of learning capabilities and innovative research in
LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型推理模型的多语言推理能力，关注其在非英语问题中使用英语推理对可解释性和语言文化细微差别处理的影响。

Method: 系统比较模型在英语与问题语言中的推理表现，评估MGSM和GPQA Diamond两个任务，分析推理轨迹中的认知属性。

Result: 英语推理轨迹显示出更高的认知行为存在，英语推理通常获得更高的答案准确率，但容易因翻译步骤导致错误。

Conclusion: 虽然英语推理在复杂任务中表现更好，但存在"翻译迷失"的关键失败模式，需要在多语言推理中平衡准确性和语言适应性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance on mathematical,
scientific, and other question-answering tasks, but their multilingual
reasoning abilities remain underexplored. When presented with non-English
questions, LRMs often default to reasoning in English, raising concerns about
interpretability and the handling of linguistic and cultural nuances. We
systematically compare an LRM's reasoning in English versus the language of the
question. Our evaluation spans two tasks: MGSM and GPQA Diamond. Beyond
measuring answer accuracy, we also analyze cognitive attributes in the
reasoning traces. We find that English reasoning traces exhibit a substantially
higher presence of these cognitive behaviors, and that reasoning in English
generally yields higher final-answer accuracy, with the performance gap
increasing as tasks become more complex. However, this English-centric strategy
is susceptible to a key failure mode - getting "Lost in Translation," where
translation steps lead to errors that would have been avoided by question's
language reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了CantoNLU基准测试，涵盖粤语自然语言理解的7个任务，评估了不同模型在粤语NLU上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决粤语因政策和双语现象导致的资源匮乏问题，缺乏评估框架。

Method: 创建CantoNLU基准测试，包含7个任务；比较了四种模型：未经粤语训练的普通话模型、通过持续预训练得到的粤语适应模型、从头训练的粤语单语模型。

Result: 粤语适应模型整体表现最佳，单语模型在句法任务上表现更好，普通话模型在某些场景下仍有竞争力。

Conclusion: 当粤语领域数据稀缺时，直接迁移可能足够；发布了所有数据集、代码和模型权重以促进粤语NLP研究。

Abstract: Cantonese, although spoken by millions, remains under-resourced due to policy
and diglossia. To address this scarcity of evaluation frameworks for Cantonese,
we introduce \textsc{\textbf{CantoNLU}}, a benchmark for Cantonese natural
language understanding (NLU). This novel benchmark spans seven tasks covering
syntax and semantics, including word sense disambiguation, linguistic
acceptability judgment, language detection, natural language inference,
sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing. In addition
to the benchmark, we provide model baseline performance across a set of models:
a Mandarin model without Cantonese training, two Cantonese-adapted models
obtained by continual pre-training a Mandarin model on Cantonese text, and a
monolingual Cantonese model trained from scratch. Results show that
Cantonese-adapted models perform best overall, while monolingual models perform
better on syntactic tasks. Mandarin models remain competitive in certain
settings, indicating that direct transfer may be sufficient when Cantonese
domain data is scarce. We release all datasets, code, and model weights to
facilitate future research in Cantonese NLP.

TL;DR: 提出神经多样性作为减少语言模型幻觉的新机制，通过解相关的并行表示，在固定参数和数据预算下降低幻觉率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管参数、计算和数据不断增加，语言模型仍然持续产生幻觉。需要寻找新的方法来提高模型可靠性

Method: 提出ND-LoRA（神经多样性低秩适应），结合并行LoRA适配器和Barlow Twins正则化，实现解相关的并行表示

Result: ND-LoRA将幻觉率降低高达25.6%（平均14.6%），且不降低总体准确性。神经相关性增加0.1%与幻觉增加3.8%相关

Conclusion: 神经多样性是继参数和数据之后的第三个扩展维度，可在固定预算下提高语言模型的可靠性

Abstract: Language models continue to hallucinate despite increases in parameters,
compute, and data. We propose neural diversity -- decorrelated parallel
representations -- as a principled mechanism that reduces hallucination rates
at fixed parameter and data budgets. Inspired by portfolio theory, where
uncorrelated assets reduce risk by $\sqrt{P}$, we prove hallucination
probability is bounded by representational correlation: $P(H) \leq
f(\sigma^2((1-\rho(P))/P + \rho(P)), \mu^2)$, which predicts that language
models need an optimal amount of neurodiversity. To validate this, we introduce
ND-LoRA (Neural Diversity Low-Rank Adaptation), combining parallel LoRA
adapters with Barlow Twins regularization, and demonstrate that ND-LoRA reduces
hallucinations by up to 25.6% (and 14.6% on average) without degrading general
accuracy. Ablations show LoRA adapters and regularization act synergistically,
causal interventions prove neurodiversity as the mediating factor and
correlational analyses indicate scale: a 0.1% neural correlation increase is
associated with a 3.8% hallucination increase. Finally, task-dependent
optimality emerges: different tasks require different amounts of optimal
neurodiversity. Together, our results highlight neural diversity as a third
axis of scaling -- orthogonal to parameters and data -- to improve the
reliability of language models at fixed budgets.

TL;DR: 该论文针对MBR解码在开放任务中的局限性，提出了三种轻量级适配方法，通过增强对结果空间结构变化的敏感性来提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MBR解码在机器翻译中有效，但在对话或指令跟随等开放任务中可能面临挑战，因为标准相似性效用函数可能选择模型分布中具有代表性但结构上非最优的响应。

Method: 提出了三种轻量级适配的效用函数，增强MBR对结果空间结构变化的敏感性；构建了包含对话行为、情感和响应结构的数据集；提出了两个评估结构最优性的指标。

Result: 分析表明常见相似性效用函数在结构最优性指标上表现不佳，而提出的适配方法显著改善了结构最优性；在真实指令跟随基准测试中，结构敏感性提升使生成质量提高了13.7个百分点。

Conclusion: 增强MBR解码对结构变化的敏感性可以显著提升开放任务中的生成质量，提出的轻量级适配方法有效解决了标准MBR在结构多样性任务中的局限性。

Abstract: Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding has seen renewed interest as an alternative
to traditional generation strategies. While MBR has proven effective in machine
translation, where the variability of a language model's outcome space is
naturally constrained, it may face challenges in more open-ended tasks such as
dialogue or instruction-following. We hypothesise that in such settings,
applying MBR with standard similarity-based utility functions may result in
selecting responses that are broadly representative of the model's
distribution, yet sub-optimal with respect to any particular grouping of
generations that share an underlying latent structure. In this work, we
introduce three lightweight adaptations to the utility function, designed to
make MBR more sensitive to structural variability in the outcome space. To test
our hypothesis, we curate a dataset capturing three representative types of
latent structure: dialogue act, emotion, and response structure (e.g., a
sentence, a paragraph, or a list). We further propose two metrics to evaluate
the structural optimality of MBR. Our analysis demonstrates that common
similarity-based utility functions fall short by these metrics. In contrast,
our proposed adaptations considerably improve structural optimality. Finally,
we evaluate our approaches on real-world instruction-following benchmarks,
AlpacaEval and MT-Bench, and show that increased structural sensitivity
improves generation quality by up to 13.7 percentage points in win rate.

*Xiaoyuan Wu,Roshni Kaushik,Wenkai Li,Lujo Bauer,Koichi Onoue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究发现，在隐私敏感场景下，用户对LLM响应的隐私保护质量和帮助性评价存在很大差异，而代理LLM与用户评价相关性很低，表明需要用户中心的研究来评估LLM的隐私保护能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究使用代理LLM评估隐私保护能力，但忽视了真实用户的感知差异，且主要关注隐私保护质量而忽略了帮助性的细微差异。

Method: 对94名参与者进行了用户研究，使用PrivacyLens中的90个场景，比较用户和5个代理LLM对相同LLM响应的评价。

Result: 用户对隐私保护质量和帮助性的评价一致性很低，而代理LLM之间一致性很高但与用户评价相关性很低。

Conclusion: LLM响应的隐私和帮助性具有个体特异性，代理LLM无法准确估计用户感知，需要用户中心的研究方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid adoption for tasks such as
drafting emails, summarizing meetings, and answering health questions. In such
uses, users may need to share private information (e.g., health records,
contact details). To evaluate LLMs' ability to identify and redact such private
information, prior work developed benchmarks (e.g., ConfAIde, PrivacyLens) with
real-life scenarios. Using these benchmarks, researchers have found that LLMs
sometimes fail to keep secrets private when responding to complex tasks (e.g.,
leaking employee salaries in meeting summaries). However, these evaluations
rely on LLMs (proxy LLMs) to gauge compliance with privacy norms, overlooking
real users' perceptions. Moreover, prior work primarily focused on the
privacy-preservation quality of responses, without investigating nuanced
differences in helpfulness. To understand how users perceive the
privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of LLM responses to
privacy-sensitive scenarios, we conducted a user study with 94 participants
using 90 scenarios from PrivacyLens. We found that, when evaluating identical
responses to the same scenario, users showed low agreement with each other on
the privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of the LLM response. Further,
we found high agreement among five proxy LLMs, while each individual LLM had
low correlation with users' evaluations. These results indicate that the
privacy and helpfulness of LLM responses are often specific to individuals, and
proxy LLMs are poor estimates of how real users would perceive these responses
in privacy-sensitive scenarios. Our results suggest the need to conduct
user-centered studies on measuring LLMs' ability to help users while preserving
privacy. Additionally, future research could investigate ways to improve the
alignment between proxy LLMs and users for better estimation of users'
perceived privacy and utility.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究开发并评估了多种NLP方法从临床笔记中提取氟嘧啶治疗和毒性信息，发现基于大语言模型的方法表现最佳，在治疗和毒性提取方面均达到F1=1.000的完美分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 氟嘧啶类药物广泛用于结直肠癌和乳腺癌治疗，但常伴随手足综合征和心脏毒性等副作用。由于毒性信息通常嵌入在临床笔记中，需要开发有效的NLP方法来提取这些关键信息。

Method: 构建了包含236份临床笔记的金标准数据集，开发了基于规则、机器学习（随机森林、SVM、逻辑回归）、深度学习（BERT、ClinicalBERT）和大语言模型（零样本和错误分析提示）的NLP方法，使用80:20的训练测试分割。

Result: 错误分析提示方法在治疗和毒性提取方面均达到最优性能（F1=1.000），零样本提示在治疗提取达到F1=1.000，毒性提取为F1=0.876。逻辑回归和SVM在毒性提取方面排名第二（F1=0.937），而深度学习方法表现较差。

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的NLP方法最有效地从临床笔记中提取氟嘧啶治疗和毒性信息，在肿瘤学研究和药物警戒方面具有强大潜力。

Abstract: Objective: Fluoropyrimidines are widely prescribed for colorectal and breast
cancers, but are associated with toxicities such as hand-foot syndrome and
cardiotoxicity. Since toxicity documentation is often embedded in clinical
notes, we aimed to develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP)
methods to extract treatment and toxicity information.
  Materials and Methods: We constructed a gold-standard dataset of 236 clinical
notes from 204,165 adult oncology patients. Domain experts annotated categories
related to treatment regimens and toxicities. We developed rule-based, machine
learning-based (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine [SVM], Logistic
Regression [LR]), deep learning-based (BERT, ClinicalBERT), and large language
models (LLM)-based NLP approaches (zero-shot and error-analysis prompting).
Models used an 80:20 train-test split.
  Results: Sufficient data existed to train and evaluate 5 annotated
categories. Error-analysis prompting achieved optimal precision, recall, and F1
scores (F1=1.000) for treatment and toxicities extraction, whereas zero-shot
prompting reached F1=1.000 for treatment and F1=0.876 for toxicities
extraction.LR and SVM ranked second for toxicities (F1=0.937). Deep learning
underperformed, with BERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1= 0.839 toxicities) and
ClinicalBERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1 = 0.886 toxicities). Rule-based methods
served as our baseline with F1 scores of 0.857 in treatment and 0.858 in
toxicities.
  Discussion: LMM-based approaches outperformed all others, followed by machine
learning methods. Machine and deep learning approaches were limited by small
training data and showed limited generalizability, particularly for rare
categories.
  Conclusion: LLM-based NLP most effectively extracted fluoropyrimidine
treatment and toxicity information from clinical notes, and has strong
potential to support oncology research and pharmacovigilance.

Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂任务中展现出了通过中间"思考"过程提升推理能力的特点，但其在机器翻译质量评估方面的潜力尚未充分探索。本文旨在系统分析LRM作为评估器在MT评估中的表现和挑战。

Method: 提出校准LRM思维的方法，通过训练模型学习合成的人类思维轨迹，解决模型过度思考和评分机制问题。在WMT24 Metrics基准上进行实验验证。

Result: 该方法显著降低了约35倍的思考预算，同时在不同规模（7B到32B）的LRM上提升了评估性能，例如R1-Distill-Qwen-7B模型实现了+8.7相关点的改进。

Conclusion: 研究表明，经过有效校准的大型推理模型有潜力推进细粒度自动机器翻译评估的发展，通过优化思维过程可以同时实现效率提升和性能改进。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have introduced an
intermediate "thinking" process prior to generating final answers, improving
their reasoning capabilities on complex downstream tasks. However, the
potential of LRMs as evaluators for machine translation (MT) quality remains
underexplored. We provides the first systematic analysis of LRM-as-a-judge in
MT evaluation. We identify key challenges, revealing LRMs require tailored
evaluation materials, tend to "overthink" simpler instances and have issues
with scoring mechanisms leading to overestimation. To address these, we propose
to calibrate LRM thinking by training them on synthetic, human-like thinking
trajectories. Our experiments on WMT24 Metrics benchmarks demonstrate that this
approach largely reduces thinking budgets by ~35x while concurrently improving
evaluation performance across different LRM scales from 7B to 32B (e.g.,
R1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves a +8.7 correlation point improvement). These
findings highlight the potential of efficiently calibrated LRMs to advance
fine-grained automatic MT evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型评估方法主要关注文本生成等高级任务，没有针对特定AI应用，无法充分评估公平性等负责任AI维度，因为不同应用中受保护属性的相关性不同。

Method: 构建了一个基于真实应用场景（根据产品特征生成纯文本产品描述）的数据集，通过公平性属性与性别化形容词及产品类别的交叉参数化，创建了丰富的带标签提示集合。

Result: 展示了如何使用该数据识别大语言模型在质量、真实性、安全性和公平性方面的差距。

Conclusion: 为大语言模型评估提出了一个具体方案，并为研究社区贡献了一个实用的资源。

Abstract: Current methods for evaluating large language models (LLMs) typically focus
on high-level tasks such as text generation, without targeting a particular AI
application. This approach is not sufficient for evaluating LLMs for
Responsible AI dimensions like fairness, since protected attributes that are
highly relevant in one application may be less relevant in another. In this
work, we construct a dataset that is driven by a real-world application
(generate a plain-text product description, given a list of product features),
parameterized by fairness attributes intersected with gendered adjectives and
product categories, yielding a rich set of labeled prompts. We show how to use
the data to identify quality, veracity, safety, and fairness gaps in LLMs,
contributing a proposal for LLM evaluation paired with a concrete resource for
the research community.

Motivation: 线性注意力模型虽然高效，但其有限的内存会导致遗忘问题，特别是在检索密集型任务中表现不佳。

Method: 结合了稀疏注意力与令牌驱逐、查询感知的本地稀疏注意力，提出可学习的令牌驱逐方法，配合滑动窗口注意力和轻量级CNN来自适应保留关键KV对。

Result: 在检索密集型基准测试中验证了方法的有效性，并提供了高效的Triton内核实现。

Conclusion: 混合模型在保持线性注意力效率的同时，显著改善了检索密集型任务的性能。

Abstract: Linear-attention models that compress the entire input sequence into a
fixed-size recurrent state offer an efficient alternative to Transformers, but
their finite memory induces forgetfulness that harms retrieval-intensive tasks.
To mitigate the issue, we explore a series of hybrid models that restore direct
access to past tokens. We interleave token mixers with intermediate time and
space complexity between linear and full attention, including sparse attention
with token eviction, and the query-aware native sparse attention. Particularly,
we propose a novel learnable token eviction approach. Combined with
sliding-window attention, an end-to-end trainable lightweight CNN aggregates
information from both past and future adjacent tokens to adaptively retain a
limited set of critical KV-pairs per head, maintaining linear attention's
constant time and space complexity. Efficient Triton kernels for the sparse
attention mechanisms are provided. Empirical evaluations on retrieval-intensive
benchmarks support the effectiveness of our approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了降低在检索增强生成(RAG)中使用长上下文的计算成本，软上下文压缩将输入序列转换为更短的连续表示。本文旨在开发更有效的压缩方法。

Method: 开发了轻量级的均值池化方法，并与广泛使用的压缩标记架构进行比较。同时研究了训练同一压缩器输出多种压缩比率的方法。在多个QA数据集、模型家族、规模和压缩比率上进行了广泛实验。

Result: 简单的均值池化方法取得了最强的性能，在训练多种压缩比率时性能下降相对较小。但总体上，不同架构和训练机制之间的权衡更加复杂。

Conclusion: 均值池化方法在软上下文压缩中表现最佳，但压缩方法的选择需要考虑复杂的权衡关系。

Abstract: A common strategy to reduce the computational costs of using long contexts in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) is soft
context compression, where the input sequence is transformed into a shorter
continuous representation. We develop a lightweight and simple mean-pooling
approach that consistently outperforms the widely used compression-tokens
architecture, and study training the same compressor to output multiple
compression ratios. We conduct extensive experiments across in-domain and
out-of-domain QA datasets, as well as across model families, scales, and
compression ratios. Overall, our simple mean-pooling approach achieves the
strongest performance, with a relatively small drop when training for multiple
compression ratios. More broadly though, across architectures and training
regimes the trade-offs are more nuanced, illustrating the complex landscape of
compression methods.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛应用，检测其生成文本的需求日益增长，但缺乏对"LLM生成文本"的统一定义，且现实使用场景复杂多样，现有检测方法难以应对。

Method: 分析现有LLM文本检测方法的局限性，包括检测目标定义不精确、忽略人类编辑影响、未充分考虑现实应用条件等。

Result: 现有检测器的数值结果经常被误解，其意义正在减弱，检测器仅在特定条件下有效。

Conclusion: LLM文本检测器在特定条件下仍然有用，但其结果应仅作为参考，不能作为决定性指标。

Abstract: With the widespread use of large language models (LLMs), many researchers
have turned their attention to detecting text generated by them. However, there
is no consistent or precise definition of their target, namely "LLM-generated
text". Differences in usage scenarios and the diversity of LLMs further
increase the difficulty of detection. What is commonly regarded as the
detecting target usually represents only a subset of the text that LLMs can
potentially produce. Human edits to LLM outputs, together with the subtle
influences that LLMs exert on their users, are blurring the line between
LLM-generated and human-written text. Existing benchmarks and evaluation
approaches do not adequately address the various conditions in real-world
detector applications. Hence, the numerical results of detectors are often
misunderstood, and their significance is diminishing. Therefore, detectors
remain useful under specific conditions, but their results should be
interpreted only as references rather than decisive indicators.

### [150] [Automating Iconclass: LLMs and RAG for Large-Scale Classification of Religious Woodcuts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19986)
*Drew B. Thomas*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 使用LLM和RAG技术结合向量数据库对早期现代宗教图像进行分类，通过全页面描述显著提升分类精度，在艺术史和数字人文学科中展现潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于图像和关键词的搜索方法在早期现代宗教图像分类中效果有限，需要更准确的大规模视觉档案分析方法。

Method: 利用LLM生成包含视觉和文本元素的全页面描述，通过混合向量搜索匹配相关的Iconclass代码，采用检索增强生成(RAG)技术。

Result: 在五级和四级分类中分别达到87%和92%的精确度，显著优于传统图像和关键词搜索方法。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了LLM和RAG技术在艺术史和数字人文学科研究中的巨大潜力，为大规模视觉档案分析提供了强大工具。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel methodology for classifying early modern
religious images by using Large Language Models (LLMs) and vector databases in
combination with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The approach leverages
the full-page context of book illustrations from the Holy Roman Empire,
allowing the LLM to generate detailed descriptions that incorporate both visual
and textual elements. These descriptions are then matched to relevant Iconclass
codes through a hybrid vector search. This method achieves 87% and 92%
precision at five and four levels of classification, significantly
outperforming traditional image and keyword-based searches. By employing
full-page descriptions and RAG, the system enhances classification accuracy,
offering a powerful tool for large-scale analysis of early modern visual
archives. This interdisciplinary approach demonstrates the growing potential of
LLMs and RAG in advancing research within art history and digital humanities.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了ConvRec-R1框架，用于训练基于大语言模型的对话推荐系统，通过两阶段方法解决LLM在推荐任务中的对齐问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在推荐系统中存在生成目录外项目、违反输出格式要求以及排名质量下降等问题，需要专门的对齐方法

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用Remap-Reflect-Adjust管道构建行为克隆数据集；第二阶段提出Rank-GRPO方法，将推荐列表中的每个排名作为优化单元

Result: 在Reddit-v2数据集上的实验表明，ConvRec-R1比GRPO基线收敛更快，Recall和NDCG指标更高

Conclusion: Rank-GRPO通过重新定义奖励和引入排名级重要性比率，有效解决了推荐任务中的对齐问题，提升了LLM推荐系统的性能

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are reshaping the recommender system paradigm by
enabling users to express preferences and receive recommendations through
conversations. Yet, aligning LLMs to the recommendation task remains
challenging: pretrained LLMs often generate out-of-catalog items, violate
required output formats, and their ranking quality degrades sharply toward the
end of the generated list. To this end, we propose ConvRec-R1, a two-stage
framework for end-to-end training of LLM-based conversational recommender
systems. In Stage 1, we construct a behavioral-cloning dataset with a
Remap-Reflect-Adjust pipeline, which produces high-quality, catalog-grounded
demonstrations from powerful blackbox LLMs to warm-start the RL training. In
Stage 2, we propose Rank-GRPO, a principled extension of group relative policy
optimization (GRPO) tailored to tasks with rank-style outputs. Rank-GRPO treats
each rank in the recommendation list as the unit instead of token (too
fine-grained) or sequence (too coarse), redefining rewards to remove non-causal
credit assignment and introducing a rank-level importance ratio based on the
geometric mean of rank-wise token probabilities to stabilize policy updates.
Experiments on the public Reddit-v2 dataset show that ConvRec-R1 converges
faster and achieves higher Recall and NDCG than GRPO-style baselines. Code and
datasets are released at https://github.com/yaochenzhu/Rank-GRPO.

semantic grounding, and outline open problems and future research directions
for building more robust and context-aware QA systems leveraging multimedia

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户兴趣和内容的动态变化给LLM推荐系统带来挑战，初始微调无法捕捉实时变化，需要有效的更新机制。

Method: 使用LLM驱动的用户兴趣探索系统作为案例研究，比较持续微调和RAG在成本、敏捷性和知识整合等维度的表现，提出结合周期性微调和低成本RAG的混合更新策略。

Result: 在十亿级用户平台上进行的实时A/B实验显示，混合方法在用户满意度方面取得了统计显著的提升。

Conclusion: 混合更新策略为维持高质量LLM推荐系统提供了实用且经济高效的框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) empower recommendation systems through their
advanced reasoning and planning capabilities. However, the dynamic nature of
user interests and content poses a significant challenge: While initial
fine-tuning aligns LLMs with domain knowledge and user preferences, it fails to
capture such real-time changes, necessitating robust update mechanisms. This
paper investigates strategies for updating LLM-powered recommenders, focusing
on the trade-offs between ongoing fine-tuning and Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG). Using an LLM-powered user interest exploration system as a
case study, we perform a comparative analysis of these methods across
dimensions like cost, agility, and knowledge incorporation. We propose a hybrid
update strategy that leverages the long-term knowledge adaptation of periodic
fine-tuning with the agility of low-cost RAG. We demonstrate through live A/B
experiments on a billion-user platform that this hybrid approach yields
statistically significant improvements in user satisfaction, offering a
practical and cost-effective framework for maintaining high-quality LLM-powered
recommender systems.

TL;DR: 提出基于内容块的音乐AI代理架构，通过块级检索和代理编排将归属直接嵌入创作流程，旨在解决AI音乐生成中的归属、权利管理和经济模型问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI正在重塑音乐创作，但其快速发展暴露了归属、权利管理和经济模型的结构性差距。现有流媒体系统无法处理AI驱动生产的规模和复杂性。

Method: 设计内容块音乐AI代理架构，将音乐组织为细粒度组件（块）存储在块数据库中，每次使用触发归属层事件，实现透明溯源和实时结算。

Result: 该框架将AI从生成工具重新定义为公平AI媒体平台的基础设施，支持细粒度归属、公平补偿和参与式互动。

Conclusion: 该系统指向后流媒体范式，音乐不再作为静态目录，而是作为协作和自适应生态系统运作。

Abstract: Generative AI is reshaping music creation, but its rapid growth exposes
structural gaps in attribution, rights management, and economic models. Unlike
past media shifts, from live performance to recordings, downloads, and
streaming, AI transforms the entire lifecycle of music, collapsing boundaries
between creation, distribution, and monetization. However, existing streaming
systems, with opaque and concentrated royalty flows, are ill-equipped to handle
the scale and complexity of AI-driven production. We propose a content-based
Music AI Agent architecture that embeds attribution directly into the creative
workflow through block-level retrieval and agentic orchestration. Designed for
iterative, session-based interaction, the system organizes music into granular
components (Blocks) stored in BlockDB; each use triggers an Attribution Layer
event for transparent provenance and real-time settlement. This framework
reframes AI from a generative tool into infrastructure for a Fair AI Media
Platform. By enabling fine-grained attribution, equitable compensation, and
participatory engagement, it points toward a post-streaming paradigm where
music functions not as a static catalog but as a collaborative and adaptive
ecosystem.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了TO-RoPE方法，通过将事件时间和序列索引作为角度源来改进RoPE位置编码，在生成式推荐系统中更好地建模时间和顺序信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式推荐系统需要同时建模用户交互序列中的时间信息和顺序信息，而现有的时间编码方法（如学习嵌入或相对注意力偏置）可能不是最优选择。

Method: 提出了TO-RoPE方法，包含三种变体：早期融合、按维度分割和按头分割，将事件时间和序列索引作为角度源来塑造查询-键几何结构。

Result: 在公开数据集和工业数据集上的实验表明，TO-RoPE变体在编码时间和索引方面持续优于现有方法，提高了推荐准确性。

Conclusion: 旋转位置嵌入为生成式推荐提供了一个简单、有原则且易于部署的基础框架。

Abstract: Generative recommenders, typically transformer-based autoregressive models,
predict the next item or action from a user's interaction history. Their
effectiveness depends on how the model represents where an interaction event
occurs in the sequence (discrete index) and when it occurred in wall-clock
time. Prevailing approaches inject time via learned embeddings or relative
attention biases. In this paper, we argue that RoPE-based approaches, if
designed properly, can be a stronger alternative for jointly modeling temporal
and sequential information in user behavior sequences. While vanilla RoPE in
LLMs considers only token order, generative recommendation requires
incorporating both event time and token index. To address this, we propose
Time-and-Order RoPE (TO-RoPE), a family of rotary position embedding designs
that treat index and time as angle sources shaping the query-key geometry
directly. We present three instantiations: early fusion, split-by-dim, and
split-by-head. Extensive experiments on both publicly available datasets and a
proprietary industrial dataset show that TO-RoPE variants consistently improve
accuracy over existing methods for encoding time and index. These results
position rotary embeddings as a simple, principled, and deployment-friendly
foundation for generative recommendation.

Method: 通过翻译现有数据集进行数据增强，覆盖所有目标语言；对Gemma-3 12B和Qwen-2.5 14B模型进行多策略微调。

Result: Gemma-3 12B(4位)模型在QC任务中使用原始和翻译数据表现最佳，在QI任务中使用原始、翻译和少数类数据创建表现最佳，最终平均F1得分为0.8857。

Conclusion: 数据增强和模型微调策略在多语言电商搜索系统中有效，Gemma-3 12B模型在两个相关性任务中均表现优异，获得竞赛第4名。

Abstract: This study presents the multilingual e-commerce search system developed by
the Tredence_AICOE team. The competition features two multilingual relevance
tasks: Query-Category (QC) Relevance, which evaluates how well a user's search
query aligns with a product category, and Query-Item (QI) Relevance, which
measures the match between a multilingual search query and an individual
product listing. To ensure full language coverage, we performed data
augmentation by translating existing datasets into languages missing from the
development set, enabling training across all target languages. We fine-tuned
Gemma-3 12B and Qwen-2.5 14B model for both tasks using multiple strategies.
The Gemma-3 12B (4-bit) model achieved the best QC performance using original
and translated data, and the best QI performance using original, translated,
and minority class data creation. These approaches secured 4th place on the
final leaderboard, with an average F1-score of 0.8857 on the private test set.

TL;DR: GREAM框架通过将预训练LLM适配为生成式推理推荐模型，解决了文本语义与协同过滤信号之间的建模差距，实现了理解-推理-预测的统一推荐方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在多个领域展现出强大推理能力，但将其原生用作生成式推理推荐模型面临挑战：文本语义与协同过滤信号的内在建模差距，以及用户反馈的稀疏性和随机性。

Method: 提出GREAM端到端框架，包含三个组件：协同语义对齐、推理课程激活、稀疏正则化组策略优化，支持两种推理模式：直接序列推荐和顺序推理推荐。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，GREAM相对于强基线模型取得了持续的性能提升。

Conclusion: GREAM为实现可验证RL驱动的LLM推荐器提供了一条实用路径，支持高吞吐量部署和可解释的因果透明度。

Abstract: Despite their remarkable reasoning capabilities across diverse domains, large
language models (LLMs) face fundamental challenges in natively functioning as
generative reasoning recommendation models (GRRMs), where the intrinsic
modeling gap between textual semantics and collaborative filtering signals,
combined with the sparsity and stochasticity of user feedback, presents
significant obstacles. This work explores how to build GRRMs by adapting
pre-trained LLMs, which achieves a unified understanding-reasoning-prediction
manner for recommendation tasks. We propose GREAM, an end-to-end framework that
integrates three components: (i) Collaborative-Semantic Alignment, which fuses
heterogeneous textual evidence to construct semantically consistent, discrete
item indices and auxiliary alignment tasks that ground linguistic
representations in interaction semantics; (ii) Reasoning Curriculum Activation,
which builds a synthetic dataset with explicit Chain-of-Thought supervision and
a curriculum that progresses through behavioral evidence extraction, latent
preference modeling, intent inference, recommendation formulation, and denoised
sequence rewriting; and (iii) Sparse-Regularized Group Policy Optimization
(SRPO), which stabilizes post-training via Residual-Sensitive Verifiable Reward
and Bonus-Calibrated Group Advantage Estimation, enabling end-to-end
optimization under verifiable signals despite sparse successes. GREAM natively
supports two complementary inference modes: Direct Sequence Recommendation for
high-throughput, low-latency deployment, and Sequential Reasoning
Recommendation that first emits an interpretable reasoning chain for causal
transparency. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate consistent gains over
strong baselines, providing a practical path toward verifiable-RL-driven LLM
recommenders.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: E-Test是一种利用大语言模型从生产环境中识别未测试执行场景并生成新测试用例的方法，显著提升测试套件的覆盖率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试套件天生不完美，现有方法难以发现超出当前测试范围的执行场景，特别是在管理大型测试套件时，寻找能探索新场景的测试用例极具挑战性且劳动密集。

Method: E-Test通过两个步骤：(i)从大规模场景（如生产环境监控）中识别尚未测试的执行场景；(ii)利用大语言模型生成新测试用例来增强测试套件，覆盖这些未测试场景。

Result: 在1,975个场景的数据集上评估，E-Test的F1分数达到0.55，显著优于现有回归测试和现场测试方法（最高0.34）以及原始大语言模型（最高0.39）。

Conclusion: E-Test能有效识别未测试的执行场景并生成相应测试用例，显著提升测试套件质量，减少维护测试套件所需的手动工作量。

Abstract: Test suites are inherently imperfect, and testers can always enrich a suite
with new test cases that improve its quality and, consequently, the reliability
of the target software system. However, finding test cases that explore
execution scenarios beyond the scope of an existing suite can be extremely
challenging and labor-intensive, particularly when managing large test suites
over extended periods.
  In this paper, we propose E-Test, an approach that reduces the gap between
the execution space explored with a test suite and the executions experienced
after testing by augmenting the test suite with test cases that explore
execution scenarios that emerge in production. E-Test (i) identifies executions
that have not yet been tested from large sets of scenarios, such as those
monitored during intensive production usage, and (ii) generates new test cases
that enhance the test suite. E-Test leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to
pinpoint scenarios that the current test suite does not adequately cover, and
augments the suite with test cases that execute these scenarios.
  Our evaluation on a dataset of 1,975 scenarios, collected from highly-starred
open-source Java projects already in production and Defects4J, demonstrates
that E-Test retrieves not-yet-tested execution scenarios significantly better
than state-of-the-art approaches. While existing regression testing and field
testing approaches for this task achieve a maximum F1-score of 0.34, and
vanilla LLMs achieve a maximum F1-score of 0.39, E-Test reaches 0.55. These
results highlight the impact of E-Test in enhancing test suites by effectively
targeting not-yet-tested execution scenarios and reducing manual effort
required for maintaining test suites.

Motivation: 电子表格在商业、会计和金融领域广泛应用，但缺乏系统化的文档记录方法，阻碍了自动化、协作和知识传递，导致关键机构知识丢失的风险。

Method: 创建包含111个电子表格操作代码片段及其对应自然语言摘要的基准数据集，使用GPT-4o、GPT-4o-mini、LLaMA-3.3-70B、Mixtral-8x7B和Gemma2-9B五个LLM模型，采用BLEU、GLEU、ROUGE-L和METEOR指标进行评估。

Result: 研究发现LLM能够生成准确的电子表格文档，使SOD成为增强电子表格可重现性、可维护性和协作工作流程的可行前提步骤。

Conclusion: 虽然LLM能够有效执行电子表格操作文档化任务，但仍存在需要解决的挑战，SOD为实现更好的电子表格协作和维护提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Numerous knowledge workers utilize spreadsheets in business, accounting, and
finance. However, a lack of systematic documentation methods for spreadsheets
hinders automation, collaboration, and knowledge transfer, which risks the loss
of crucial institutional knowledge. This paper introduces Spreadsheet
Operations Documentation (SOD), an AI task that involves generating
human-readable explanations from spreadsheet operations. Many previous studies
have utilized Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating spreadsheet
manipulation code; however, translating that code into natural language for SOD
is a less-explored area. To address this, we present a benchmark of 111
spreadsheet manipulation code snippets, each paired with a corresponding
natural language summary. We evaluate five LLMs, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini,
LLaMA-3.3-70B, Mixtral-8x7B, and Gemma2-9B, using BLEU, GLEU, ROUGE-L, and
METEOR metrics. Our findings suggest that LLMs can generate accurate
spreadsheet documentation, making SOD a feasible prerequisite step toward
enhancing reproducibility, maintainability, and collaborative workflows in
spreadsheets, although there are challenges that need to be addressed.

Conclusion: KGACG致力于推进应用级软件开发自动化。

Abstract: Automated code generation driven by Large Lan- guage Models (LLMs) has
enhanced development efficiency, yet generating complex application-level
software code remains challenging. Multi-agent frameworks show potential, but
existing methods perform inadequately in large-scale application-level software
code generation, failing to ensure reasonable orga- nizational structures of
project code and making it difficult to maintain the code generation process.
To address this, this paper envisions a Knowledge-Guided Application-Level Code
Generation framework named KGACG, which aims to trans- form software
requirements specification and architectural design document into executable
code through a collaborative closed- loop of the Code Organization & Planning
Agent (COPA), Coding Agent (CA), and Testing Agent (TA), combined with a
feedback mechanism. We demonstrate the collaborative process of the agents in
KGACG in a Java Tank Battle game case study while facing challenges. KGACG is
dedicated to advancing the automation of application-level software
development.

Motivation: 现有方法通过故意引入局部扰动生成bug，会产生分布外效应，不能反映真实的开发过程。需要更自然的bug生成方法来训练更好的软件工程代理。

Method: 指导软件工程代理向代码库添加功能，在此过程中可能无意破坏测试，从而产生bug。这种方法模拟了真实的开发过程。

Result: 该方法生成的bug更接近人工编辑模式，在监督微调中仅用1.2k个bug就比其他数据集3k个bug表现好2%。训练出的FrogBoss模型在SWE-bench Verified上达到54.6%的pass@1，FrogMini达到45.3%。

Conclusion: 通过模拟真实开发过程生成bug的方法能产生更有效的训练数据，显著提升软件工程代理的性能。

Abstract: High quality bugs are key to training the next generation of language model
based software engineering (SWE) agents. We introduce a novel method for
synthetic generation of difficult and diverse bugs. Our method instructs SWE
Agents to introduce a feature into the codebase whereby they may
unintentionally break tests, resulting in bugs. Prior approaches often induce
an out-of-distribution effect by generating bugs intentionally (e.g. by
introducing local perturbation to existing code), which does not reflect
realistic development processes. We perform qualitative analysis to demonstrate
that our approach for generating bugs more closely reflects the patterns found
in human-authored edits. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our
bugs provide more efficient training data for supervised fine-tuning,
outperforming other bug datasets by 2% with half the training data (1.2k vs. 3k
bugs). We train on our newly generated bugs in addition to existing bug
datasets to get FrogBoss a state-of-the-art 32B parameter model on SWE-bench
Verified with a pass@1 of 54.6% and FrogMini a state-of-the-art 14B model on
SWE-bench Verified with a pass@1 of 45.3% on SWE-bench Verified averaged over

TL;DR: MuoFuzz是一种灰盒模糊测试工具，通过学习和选择最有希望的变异器序列来提高测试效率，相比AFL++和MOPT实现了更高的代码覆盖率并发现了更多漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现变异器应用于种子输入的顺序对灰盒模糊测试器的有效性有影响，通过实验观察到变异器对之间存在交互效应，这为选择更有效的变异器序列提供了可能性。

Method: 提出MuoFuzz，通过学习给定先前选择的变异器后下一个变异器产生有趣输入的条件概率，然后使用随机游走从学习到的概率中采样生成变异器序列。

Result: 在FuzzBench和MAGMA基准测试中，MuoFuzz实现了最高的代码覆盖率，发现了AFL++遗漏的4个漏洞以及AFL++和MOPT都遗漏的1个漏洞。

Conclusion: 通过学习变异器序列的交互效应并智能选择变异顺序，可以显著提高灰盒模糊测试的效率和效果。

Abstract: A greybox fuzzer is an automated software testing tool that generates new
test inputs by applying randomly chosen mutators (e.g., flipping a bit or
deleting a block of bytes) to a seed input in random order and adds all
coverage-increasing inputs to the corpus of seeds. We hypothesize that the
order in which mutators are applied to a seed input has an impact on the
effectiveness of greybox fuzzers. In our experiments, we fit a linear model to
a dataset that contains the effectiveness of all possible mutator pairs and
indeed observe the conjectured interaction effect. This points us to more
efficient fuzzing by choosing the most promising mutator sequence with a higher
likelihood. We propose MuoFuzz, a greybox fuzzer that learns and chooses the
most promising mutator sequences. MuoFuzz learns the conditional probability
that the next mutator will yield an interesting input, given the previously
selected mutator. Then, it samples from the learned probability using a random
walk to generate mutator sequences. We compare the performance of MuoFuzz to
AFL++, which uses a fixed selection probability, and MOPT, which optimizes the
selection probability of each mutator in isolation. Experimental results on the
FuzzBench and MAGMA benchmarks show that MuoFuzz achieves the highest code
coverage and finds four bugs missed by AFL++ and one missed by both AFL++ and
MOPT.

theory, lack the specificity required for GenAI implementation across these
diverse contexts, creating a critical gap in adoption literature. This paper
introduces FAIGMOE (Framework for the Adoption and Integration of Generative AI
in Midsize Organizations and Enterprises), a conceptual framework addressing
the unique needs of both organizational types. FAIGMOE synthesizes technology
adoption theory, organizational change management, and innovation diffusion
perspectives into four interconnected phases: Strategic Assessment, Planning
and Use Case Development, Implementation and Integration, and
Operationalization and Optimization. Each phase provides scalable guidance on
readiness assessment, strategic alignment, risk governance, technical
architecture, and change management adaptable to organizational scale and
complexity. The framework incorporates GenAI specific considerations including
prompt engineering, model orchestration, and hallucination management that
distinguish it from generic technology adoption frameworks. As a perspective
contribution, FAIGMOE provides the first comprehensive conceptual framework
explicitly addressing GenAI adoption across midsize and enterprise
organizations, offering actionable implementation protocols, assessment
instruments, and governance templates requiring empirical validation through
future research.

### [164] [The Cost of Downgrading Build Systems: A Case Study of Kubernetes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20041)
*Gareema Ranjan,Mahmoud Alfadel,Gengyi Sun,Shane McIntosh*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Kubernetes项目从Bazel降级到Go Build的案例研究显示，虽然Bazel构建速度更快，但内存占用更大，在并行构建时CPU负载更高。降级会导致构建时间增加和CI资源成本上升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究团队放弃基于工件的构建工具（如Bazel）转而使用语言特定解决方案（如Go Build）的性能影响，尽管前者在构建速度上有优势但维护性较差。

Method: 对Kubernetes项目在降级期间的完整和增量构建进行重现和分析，并在其他四个也从Bazel降级的项目中复制研究。

Result: Bazel构建比Go Build快23.06-38.66%（完整构建）和75.19%（增量构建），但内存占用多81.42-351.07%。在并行度高于8时Bazel的CPU负载更大。降级可能使CI资源成本增加76%。

Conclusion: 放弃基于工件的构建工具虽然可能提高可维护性，但会对大型项目带来显著的性能成本。这些观察有助于利益相关者在构建工具采用中权衡利弊。

Abstract: Since developers invoke the build system frequently, its performance can
impact productivity. Modern artifact-based build tools accelerate builds, yet
prior work shows that teams may abandon them for alternatives that are easier
to maintain. While prior work shows why downgrades are performed, the
implications of downgrades remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we
describe a case study of the Kubernetes project, focusing on its downgrade from
an artifact-based build tool (Bazel) to a language-specific solution (Go
Build). We reproduce and analyze the full and incremental builds of change sets
during the downgrade period. On the one hand, we find that Bazel builds are
faster than Go Build, completing full builds in 23.06-38.66 up to 75.19 impose
a larger memory footprint than Go Build of 81.42-351.07 respectively. Bazel
builds also impose a greater CPU load at parallelism settings above eight for
full builds and above one for incremental builds. We estimate that downgrading
from Bazel can increase CI resource costs by up to 76 explore whether our
observations generalize by replicating our Kubernetes study on four other
projects that also downgraded from Bazel to older build tools. We observe that
while build time penalties decrease, Bazel consistently consumes more memory.
We conclude that abandoning artifact-based build tools, despite perceived
maintainability benefits, tends to incur considerable performance costs for
large projects. Our observations may help stakeholders to balance trade-offs in
build tool adoption

TL;DR: 提出了一种模型驱动重构软件过程，用于将PL/SQL代码迁移到Java，集成了类似TDD的方法和三层验证机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代软件技术发展促使企业需要迁移RAD平台（如Oracle Forms）的遗留应用，特别是将PL/SQL单体代码重构为分层Java代码。

Method: 使用KDM模型表示遗留代码，采用模型驱动重构方法，集成类似TDD的增量开发模型转换，包含三层代码验证机制。

Result: 开发了从PL/SQL到Java的迁移工具，详细实现了重构方法并验证了MDE应用的相关问题。

Conclusion: 模型驱动工程方法不仅适用于正向工程，也能成功应用于现有系统的演进和重构。

Abstract: Model-driven software engineering (MDE) techniques are not only useful in
forward engineering scenarios, but can also be successfully applied to evolve
existing systems. RAD (Rapid Application Development) platforms emerged in the
nineties, but the success of modern software technologies motivated that a
large number of enterprises tackled the migration of their RAD applications,
such as Oracle Forms. Our research group has collaborated with a software
company in developing a solution to migrate PL/SQL monolithic code on Forms
triggers and program units to Java code separated in several tiers.
  Our research focused on the model-driven reengineering process applied to
develop the migration tool for the conversion of PL/SQL code to Java. Legacy
code is represented in form of KDM (Knowledge-Discovery Metamodel) models. In
this paper, we propose a software process to implement a model-driven
re-engineering. This process integrates a TDD-like approach to incrementally
develop model transformations with three kinds of validations for the generated
code. The implementation and validation of the re-engineering approach are
explained in detail, as well as the evaluation of some issues related with the
application of MDE.

TL;DR: NSync是一个自动化系统，用于基础设施即代码(IaC)的协调，通过分析云API调用来检测和修复基础设施漂移，使用LLM推断高层面意图并生成IaC更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当IaC与云控制台、CLI或SDK一起使用时，会失去对外部变化的可见性，导致基础设施漂移，配置过时，后续IaC操作可能撤销有效更新或触发错误。

Method: NSync从API跟踪中获取洞察，检测漂移并进行协调，采用代理架构，利用LLM从嘈杂的API序列推断高层面意图，使用专用工具合成有针对性的IaC更新，并通过自演进知识库持续改进。

Result: 在五个真实世界的Terraform项目和372个漂移场景的实验中，NSync在准确性（从0.71提高到0.97 pass@3）和令牌效率（1.47倍改进）方面均优于基线。

Conclusion: NSync通过自动检测和修复基础设施漂移，有效解决了IaC与外部工具并行使用时的协调问题，显著提高了IaC管理的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Cloud infrastructure is managed through a mix of interfaces -- traditionally,
cloud consoles, command-line interfaces (CLI), and SDKs are the tools of
choice. Recently, Infrastructure-as-Code/IaC frameworks (e.g., Terraform) have
quickly gained popularity. Unlike conventional tools, IaC~frameworks encode the
infrastructure in a "source-of-truth" configuration. They are capable of
automatically carrying out modifications to the cloud -- deploying, updating,
or destroying resources -- to bring the actual infrastructure into alignment
with the IaC configuration. However, when IaC is used alongside consoles, CLIs,
or SDKs, it loses visibility into external changes, causing infrastructure
drift, where the configuration becomes outdated, and later IaC operations may
undo valid updates or trigger errors.
  We present NSync, an automated system for IaC reconciliation that propagates
out-of-band changes back into the IaC program. Our key insight is that
infrastructure changes eventually all occur via cloud API invocations -- the
lowest layer for cloud management operations. NSync gleans insights from API
traces to detect drift (i.e., non-IaC changes) and reconcile it (i.e., update
the IaC configuration to capture the changes). It employs an agentic
architecture that leverages LLMs to infer high-level intents from noisy API
sequences, synthesize targeted IaC updates using specialized tools, and
continually improve through a self-evolving knowledge base of past
reconciliations. We further introduce a novel evaluation pipeline for injecting
realistic drifts into cloud infrastructure and assessing reconciliation
performance. Experiments across five real-world Terraform projects and 372
drift scenarios show that NSync outperforms the baseline both in terms of
accuracy (from 0.71 to 0.97 pass@3) and token efficiency (1.47$\times$
improvement).

TL;DR: Classport系统通过在Java类文件中嵌入依赖信息，实现了运行时依赖关系自省，解决了Java缺乏运行时依赖观察能力的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Java缺乏运行时依赖自省能力，这对于软件供应链安全至关重要。需要能够观察程序执行期间实际使用的依赖项。

Method: 开发Classport系统，将依赖信息嵌入到Java类文件中，使得运行时能够检索依赖信息。

Result: 在6个真实项目中评估Classport，证明其在运行时识别依赖关系的可行性。

Conclusion: Classport的运行时依赖自省能力为运行时完整性检查开辟了重要途径。

Abstract: Runtime introspection of dependencies, i.e., the ability to observe which
dependencies are currently used during program execution, is fundamental for
Software Supply Chain security. Yet, Java has no support for it. We solve this
problem with Classport, a system that embeds dependency information into Java
class files, enabling the retrieval of dependency information at runtime. We
evaluate Classport on six real-world projects, demonstrating the feasibility in
identifying dependencies at runtime. Runtime dependency introspection with
Classport opens important avenues for runtime integrity checking.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于UniFMU的分布式协同仿真方法，通过增强网络安全和IP保护机制，确保连接由客户端发起且模型和二进制文件位于可信平台。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式协同仿真在保护知识产权的同时支持多方协作建模，但目前缺乏针对连续时间或混合系统分布式仿真的网络安全指南，无法防范潜在的黑客攻击。

Method: 在UniFMU基础上构建分布式协同仿真框架，采用增强的网络安全和IP保护机制，要求连接由客户端发起，模型和二进制文件驻留在可信平台上。

Result: 通过四个不同网络设置下的两个协同仿真演示验证了该方法的可行性，并分析了IP保护分布与性能效率之间的权衡关系。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了分布式协同仿真的网络安全和IP保护，为连续时间或混合系统的安全协作仿真提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Distributed co-simulation plays a key role in enabling collaborative modeling
and simulation by different stakeholders while protecting their Intellectual
Property (IP). Although IP protection is provided implicitly by co-simulation,
there is no consensus in the guidelines to conduct distributed co-simulation of
continuous-time or hybrid systems with no exposure to potential hacking
attacks. We propose an approach for distributed co-simulation on top of UniFMU
with enhanced cybersecurity and IP protection mechanisms, ensuring that the
connection is initiated by the client and the models and binaries live on
trusted platforms. We showcase the functionality of this approach using two
co-simulation demos in four different network settings and analyze the
trade-off between IP-protected distribution and performance efficiency in these
settings.

Motivation: 尽管演绎验证在特定项目中证明有效可行，但尚未成为主流技术。为了促进其广泛应用，需要研究成功应用的因素和阻碍广泛采用的根本问题。

Method: 采用半结构化访谈方法，采访了30位来自工业界和学术界的验证从业者，并使用主题分析方法系统分析收集的数据。

Result: 除了实证确认熟悉的挑战（如进行形式化证明需要高水平专业知识）外，数据还揭示了几个未充分探索的障碍，包括证明维护、自动化控制不足和可用性问题。

Abstract: Deductive verification is an effective method to ensure that a given system
exposes the intended behavior. In spite of its proven usefulness and
feasibility in selected projects, deductive verification is still not a
mainstream technique. To pave the way to widespread use, we present a study
investigating the factors enabling successful applications of deductive
verification and the underlying issues preventing broader adoption. We
conducted semi-structured interviews with 30 practitioners of verification from
both industry and academia and systematically analyzed the collected data
employing a thematic analysis approach. Beside empirically confirming familiar
challenges, e.g., the high level of expertise needed for conducting formal
proofs, our data reveal several underexplored obstacles, such as proof
maintenance, insufficient control over automation, and usability concerns. We
further use the results from our data analysis to extract enablers and barriers
for deductive verification and formulate concrete recommendations for
practitioners, tool builders, and researchers, including principles for
usability, automation, and integration with existing workflows.

TL;DR: 本文对大型语言模型在代码故障定位任务中的表现进行了系统实证研究，评估了开源和闭源模型在不同提示策略下的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏对LLM在代码故障定位任务中的全面评估，而修复效果高度依赖于上游故障定位的性能。

Method: 在HumanEval-Java和Defects4J数据集上评估代表性开源和闭源模型，研究标准提示、少样本示例和思维链等不同提示策略对模型性能的影响。

Result: 包含错误报告上下文显著提升模型性能，少样本学习有改进潜力但存在边际收益递减现象，思维链推理的有效性高度依赖于模型固有推理能力。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了不同模型在故障定位任务中的性能特征和权衡，为理解当前LLM的优势和提升故障定位效果提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
code-related tasks, particularly in automated program repair. However, the
effectiveness of such repairs is highly dependent on the performance of
upstream fault localization, for which comprehensive evaluations are currently
lacking. This paper presents a systematic empirical study on LLMs in the
statement-level code fault localization task. We evaluate representative
open-source models (Qwen2.5-coder-32b-instruct, DeepSeek-V3) and closed-source
models (GPT-4.1 mini, Gemini-2.5-flash) to assess their fault localization
capabilities on the HumanEval-Java and Defects4J datasets. The study
investigates the impact of different prompting strategies--including standard
prompts, few-shot examples, and chain-of-reasoning--on model performance, with
a focus on analysis across accuracy, time efficiency, and economic cost
dimensions. Our experimental results show that incorporating bug report context
significantly enhances model performance. Few-shot learning shows potential for
improvement but exhibits noticeable diminishing marginal returns, while
chain-of-thought reasoning's effectiveness is highly contingent on the model's
inherent reasoning capabilities. This study not only highlights the performance
characteristics and trade-offs of different models in fault localization tasks,
but also offers valuable insights into the strengths of current LLMs and
strategies for improving fault localization effectiveness.

TL;DR: 开发了Deblometer微基准测试套件来评估Java去膨胀工具，发现现有工具都存在移除必需程序构造的问题，特别是在动态类加载方面存在不健全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代软件开发依赖大量库依赖，其中80%是传递依赖，但只有24.9%在运行时真正需要，导致大量无用代码。需要评估去膨胀工具在精度（移除无用构造）和健全性（保留必需构造）之间的权衡。

Method: 开发Deblometer微基准测试套件，包含59个测试用例，每个用例都有手动标注的必需和膨胀类、方法、字段的基准真值，用于精确测量去膨胀工具的健全性和精度。

Result: 评估了三个流行的Java去膨胀工具（Deptrim、JShrink、ProGuard），发现所有工具都会移除必需程序构造，导致语义改变或执行崩溃。动态类加载功能在所有工具中都引入不健全性。Deptrim保留更多膨胀构造，ProGuard移除更多必需构造，JShrink因注解支持有限而严重影响健全性。

Conclusion: 现有去膨胀工具存在严重的健全性问题，需要改进以确保生成稳定可靠的去膨胀软件。

Abstract: Modern software development reuses code by importing libraries as
dependencies. Software projects typically include an average of 36
dependencies, with 80% being transitive, meaning they are dependencies of
dependencies. Recent research indicates that only 24.9% of these dependencies
are required at runtime, and even within those, many program constructs remain
unused, adding unnecessary code to the project. This has led to the development
of debloating tools that remove unnecessary dependencies and program constructs
while balancing precision by eliminating unused constructs and soundness by
preserving all required constructs. To systematically evaluate this trade-off,
we developed Deblometer, a micro-benchmark consisting of 59 test cases designed
to assess support for various Java language features in debloating tools. Each
test case includes a manually curated ground truth specifying necessary and
bloated classes, methods, and fields, enabling precise measurement of soundness
and precision. Using Deblometer, we evaluated three popular Java debloating
tools: Deptrim, JShrink, and ProGuard. Our evaluation reveals that all tools
remove required program constructs, which results in changed semantics or
execution crashes. In particular, the dynamic class loading feature introduces
unsoundness in all evaluated tools. Our comparison shows that Deptrim retains
more bloated constructs, while ProGuard removes more required constructs.
JShrink's soundness is significantly affected by limited support for
annotations, which leads to corrupted debloated artifacts. These soundness
issues highlight the need to improve debloating tools to ensure stable and
reliable debloated software.

TL;DR: 本文探索了大型语言模型在访问控制策略生成和总结方面的有效性，发现LLM在策略生成方面存在许可性问题，但在结合符号方法分析现有策略时表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云计算的普及使得访问控制策略变得复杂且容易出错，而LLM在代码合成和总结方面表现出色，因此研究LLM能否自动生成访问控制策略或帮助理解现有策略。

Method: 首先研究不同LLM生成访问控制策略的能力，然后提出一种基于语义的请求总结方法，利用LLM精确描述策略允许的请求特征。

Result: LLM能有效生成语法正确的策略，但存在许可性问题：非推理LLM生成符合规范的策略占45.8%，推理LLM占93.7%。在策略分析方面，LLM与符号方法结合表现良好。

Conclusion: 虽然LLM在自动策略生成方面存在显著障碍，但在分析现有策略时与符号方法结合显示出有前景的结果。

Abstract: Cloud computing is ubiquitous, with a growing number of services being hosted
on the cloud every day. Typical cloud compute systems allow administrators to
write policies implementing access control rules which specify how access to
private data is governed. These policies must be manually written, and due to
their complexity can often be error prone. Moreover, existing policies often
implement complex access control specifications and thus can be difficult to
precisely analyze in determining their behavior works exactly as intended.
Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great success in automated
code synthesis and summarization. Given this success, they could potentially be
used for automatically generating access control policies or aid in
understanding existing policies. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of
LLMs for access control policy synthesis and summarization. Specifically, we
first investigate diverse LLMs for access control policy synthesis, finding
that: although LLMs can effectively generate syntactically correct policies,
they have permissiveness issues, generating policies equivalent to the given
specification 45.8% of the time for non-reasoning LLMs, and 93.7% of the time
for reasoning LLMs. We then investigate how LLMs can be used to analyze
policies by introducing a novel semantic-based request summarization approach
which leverages LLMs to generate a precise characterization of the requests
allowed by a policy. Our results show that while there are significant hurdles
in leveraging LLMs for automated policy generation, LLMs show promising results
when combined with symbolic approaches in analyzing existing policies.

TL;DR: 在混合SSM-Transformer架构中，检索功能完全由自注意力层承担，SSM层无法补偿注意力层的缺失。仅保留15%的注意力头就能维持近乎完美的检索性能，同时保留84%的MMLU能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究混合SSM-Transformer架构中不同组件的功能专门化程度，挑战关于架构冗余的假设。

Method: 通过对RecurrentGemma-2B/9B和Jamba-Mini-1.6模型进行注意力消融实验和稀疏化实验，分析不同组件在检索任务中的作用。

Result: 注意力消融导致检索任务完全失败（0%准确率），而SSM层无法补偿；仅保留15%注意力头就能维持近乎完美的检索性能，同时保持84%的MMLU性能。

Conclusion: 混合架构中的组件具有严格的功能专门化，自注意力层专门负责检索任务，这些模型更像专门化模块而非集成系统，对架构优化和可解释性有重要影响。

Abstract: We demonstrate complete functional segregation in hybrid SSM-Transformer
architectures: retrieval depends exclusively on self-attention layers. Across
RecurrentGemma-2B/9B and Jamba-Mini-1.6, attention ablation causes catastrophic
retrieval failure (0% accuracy), while SSM layers show no compensatory
mechanisms even with improved prompting. Conversely, sparsifying attention to
just 15% of heads maintains near-perfect retrieval while preserving 84% MMLU
performance, suggesting self-attention specializes primarily for retrieval
tasks. We identify precise mechanistic requirements for retrieval: needle
tokens must be exposed during generation and sufficient context must be
available during prefill or generation. This strict functional specialization
challenges assumptions about redundancy in hybrid architectures and suggests
these models operate as specialized modules rather than integrated systems,
with immediate implications for architecture optimization and interpretability.

Motivation: 传统深度强化学习代理的性能受限于固定的神经网络架构，需要通过昂贵的超参数搜索来确定，且训练过程中无法调整。本研究探索在线自适应架构优化是否能突破这一限制。

Method: 提出NAS-DQN代理，将学习到的神经架构搜索控制器直接集成到DRL训练循环中，基于累积性能反馈实现动态网络重构。

Result: NAS-DQN在连续控制任务中优于三个固定架构基线和随机搜索控制，实现了更优的最终性能、样本效率和策略稳定性，且计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: 架构自适应不仅是有益的，而且是实现在线深度强化学习最优样本效率的必要条件，RL代理的设计可以无缝集成为学习过程的动态组件。

Abstract: The performance of deep reinforcement learning agents is fundamentally
constrained by their neural network architecture, a choice traditionally made
through expensive hyperparameter searches and then fixed throughout training.
This work investigates whether online, adaptive architecture optimization can
escape this constraint and outperform static designs. We introduce NAS-DQN, an
agent that integrates a learned neural architecture search controller directly
into the DRL training loop, enabling dynamic network reconfiguration based on
cumulative performance feedback. We evaluate NAS-DQN against three
fixed-architecture baselines and a random search control on a continuous
control task, conducting experiments over multiple random seeds. Our results
demonstrate that NAS-DQN achieves superior final performance, sample
efficiency, and policy stability while incurring negligible computational
overhead. Critically, the learned search strategy substantially outperforms
both undirected random architecture exploration and poorly-chosen fixed
designs, indicating that intelligent, performance-guided search is the key
mechanism driving success. These findings establish that architecture
adaptation is not merely beneficial but necessary for optimal sample efficiency
in online deep reinforcement learning, and suggest that the design of RL agents
need not be a static offline choice but can instead be seamlessly integrated as
a dynamic component of the learning process itself.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法面临两大挑战：基于云的LLM API存在代码泄露风险，本地部署计算成本高且效率低。SLM虽然轻量且隐私友好，但在复杂CUDA生成任务中推理能力有限导致性能不佳。

Method: 将CUDA优化轨迹组织为结构化推理图，将组合优化建模为状态转换，利用蒙特卡洛图搜索进行高效探索，无需训练即可增强SLM推理能力。

Result: 在CUDAEval和ParEval基准测试中平均实现2.33倍加速，优于HPC专用微调模型和其他检索增强方法，使SLM接近LLM级性能。

Conclusion: ReGraphT框架成功解决了SLM在复杂CUDA代码生成中的推理限制，在保持隐私和计算效率的同时实现了接近LLM的性能水平。

Abstract: Despite significant evolution of CUDA programming and domain-specific
libraries, effectively utilizing GPUs with massively parallel engines remains
difficult. Large language models (LLMs) show strong potential in generating
optimized CUDA code from sequential code. However, using LLMs in practice faces
two major challenges: cloud-based APIs pose risks of code leakage, and local
deployment is often computationally expensive and inefficient. These drawbacks
have spurred interest in small language models (SLMs), which are more
lightweight and privacy-friendly. Encouragingly, recent studies show that SLMs
can achieve performance comparable to LLMs on specific tasks. While SLMs can
match LLMs on domain-specific tasks, their limited reasoning abilities lead to
suboptimal performance in complex CUDA generation according to our experiments.
To bridge this gap, we propose ReGraphT, a training-free, retrieval-augmented
generation framework that transfers LLM-level reasoning to smaller models.
ReGraphT organizes CUDA optimization trajectories into a structured reasoning
graph, modeling the combined CUDA optimizations as state transitions, and
leverages Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. We also
present a CUDA-specific benchmark with difficulty tiers defined by reasoning
complexity to evaluate models more comprehensively. Experiments show that
ReGraphT outperforms HPC-specific fine-tuned models and other
retrieval-augmented approaches, achieving an average 2.33X speedup on CUDAEval
and ParEval. When paired with DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct and
Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct, ReGraphT enables SLMs to approach LLM-level
performance without the associated privacy risks or excessive computing
overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统交通分配问题的数学规划方法在大规模网络中计算复杂度非线性增长，变得计算昂贵。需要更高效的数据驱动方法。

Method: 使用Transformer架构的深度神经网络，直接预测均衡路径流量，捕捉OD对间的复杂相关性，提供比传统链路级方法更详细灵活的分析。

Result: 在多个网络上进行数值实验，证明该模型比传统优化方法快几个数量级，能高效估计多类网络中的路径级交通流量，降低计算成本并提高预测精度。

Conclusion: 该模型能灵活适应变化的需求和网络条件，支持交通管理并实现快速的"假设分析"，提升交通规划和政策制定的效率。

Abstract: The traffic assignment problem is essential for traffic flow analysis,
traditionally solved using mathematical programs under the Equilibrium
principle. These methods become computationally prohibitive for large-scale
networks due to non-linear growth in complexity with the number of OD pairs.
This study introduces a novel data-driven approach using deep neural networks,
specifically leveraging the Transformer architecture, to predict equilibrium
path flows directly. By focusing on path-level traffic distribution, the
proposed model captures intricate correlations between OD pairs, offering a
more detailed and flexible analysis compared to traditional link-level
approaches. The Transformer-based model drastically reduces computation time,
while adapting to changes in demand and network structure without the need for
recalculation. Numerical experiments are conducted on the Manhattan-like
synthetic network, the Sioux Falls network, and the Eastern-Massachusetts
network. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is orders of magnitude
faster than conventional optimization. It efficiently estimates path-level
traffic flows in multi-class networks, reducing computational costs and
improving prediction accuracy by capturing detailed trip and flow information.
The model also adapts flexibly to varying demand and network conditions,
supporting traffic management and enabling rapid `what-if' analyses for
enhanced transportation planning and policy-making.

TL;DR: 提出了FairGRPO方法，通过分层强化学习解决医疗AI系统中的公平性问题，在7个临床数据集上显著减少预测偏差并提高性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗AI系统在诊断能力上表现出色，但在不同人口群体间存在显著的性能差异，对代表性不足的群体造成实际伤害。现有的多模态推理基础模型通过强化学习训练时会继承并放大训练数据中的偏见

Method: FairGRPO是一种分层强化学习方法，采用基于表示、任务难度和数据来源的自适应重要性权重调整优势。对于临床领域常见的缺失人口统计标签问题，使用无监督聚类自动发现潜在的人口群体

Result: 在7个临床诊断数据集上，FairGRPO将预测公平性提高了27.2%，同时F1分数提高了12.49%。训练动态分析显示FairGRPO在整个优化过程中持续改善公平性

Conclusion: FairGRPO有效解决了医疗AI中的公平性问题，并基于此发布了FairMedGemma-4B模型，该模型在保持最先进性能的同时显著减少了跨人口群体的差异

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence systems have achieved remarkable diagnostic
capabilities, yet they consistently exhibit performance disparities across
demographic groups, causing real-world harm to underrepresented populations.
While recent multimodal reasoning foundation models have advanced clinical
diagnosis through integrated analysis of diverse medical data, reasoning
trainings via reinforcement learning inherit and often amplify biases present
in training datasets dominated by majority populations. We introduce
Fairness-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (FairGRPO), a hierarchical
reinforcement learning approach that promotes equitable learning across
heterogeneous clinical populations. FairGRPO employs adaptive importance
weighting of advantages based on representation, task difficulty, and data
source. To address the common issue of missing demographic labels in the
clinical domain, we further employ unsupervised clustering, which automatically
discovers latent demographic groups when labels are unavailable. Through
comprehensive experiments across 7 clinical diagnostic datasets spanning 5
clinical modalities across X-ray, CT scan, dermoscropy, mammography and
ultrasound, we demonstrate that FairGRPO reduces predictive parity by 27.2%
against all vanilla and bias mitigated RL baselines, while improving F1 score
by 12.49%. Furthermore, training dynamics analysis reveals that FairGRPO
progressively improves fairness throughout optimization, while baseline RL
methods exhibit deteriorating fairness as training progresses. Based on
FairGRPO, we release FairMedGemma-4B, a fairness-aware clinical VLLM that
achieves state-of-the-art performance while demonstrating significantly reduced
disparities across demographic groups.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了代码生成任务中的检索设计，发现在不同计算预算下，PL-PL任务中稀疏BM25+词级分割效果最佳，而NL-PL任务中密集编码器表现更好但延迟高100倍。最佳分块大小随上下文窗口变化，简单行级分块与语法感知分块效果相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实计算预算下研究代码生成任务的检索设计，为构建有效的代码导向RAG系统提供基于证据的建议。

Method: 使用Long Code Arena中的代码补全和bug定位任务，系统比较不同上下文窗口大小下的检索配置，包括分块策略、相似性评分和分割粒度三个维度。

Result: PL-PL任务中稀疏BM25+词级分割效果最好且速度快10倍；NL-PL任务中密集编码器表现更好但延迟高100倍；最佳分块大小32-64行；行级分块与语法感知分块效果相当；检索延迟差异可达200倍。

Conclusion: 为代码导向RAG系统提供了基于任务需求、模型约束和计算效率的证据性建议，BM25+词级分割在质量和延迟之间提供了最佳权衡。

Abstract: We study retrieval design for code-focused generation tasks under realistic
compute budgets. Using two complementary tasks from Long Code Arena -- code
completion and bug localization -- we systematically compare retrieval
configurations across various context window sizes along three axes: (i)
chunking strategy, (ii) similarity scoring, and (iii) splitting granularity.
(1) For PL-PL, sparse BM25 with word-level splitting is the most effective and
practical, significantly outperforming dense alternatives while being an order
of magnitude faster. (2) For NL-PL, proprietary dense encoders (Voyager-3
family) consistently beat sparse retrievers, however requiring 100x larger
latency. (3) Optimal chunk size scales with available context: 32-64 line
chunks work best at small budgets, and whole-file retrieval becomes competitive
at 16000 tokens. (4) Simple line-based chunking matches syntax-aware splitting
across budgets. (5) Retrieval latency varies by up to 200x across
configurations; BPE-based splitting is needlessly slow, and BM25 + word
splitting offers the best quality-latency trade-off. Thus, we provide
evidence-based recommendations for implementing effective code-oriented RAG
systems based on task requirements, model constraints, and computational
efficiency.

Motivation: 开发更透明、可靠和高效的临床决策支持系统，优化泌尿系统疾病特别是膀胱癌的筛查和早期诊断。

Method: 采用SHAP-based特征选择方法，使用XGBoost、LightGBM和CatBoost算法，通过Optuna进行超参数优化，使用SMOTE技术进行类别平衡，构建六个二元分类场景。

Conclusion: 基于可解释性技术（SHAP）的特征选择被证明是一种有效方法，有助于开发更透明、可靠和高效的临床决策支持系统。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an approach to support the diagnosis of urinary
tract diseases, with a focus on bladder cancer, using SHAP (SHapley Additive
exPlanations)-based feature selection to enhance the transparency and
effectiveness of predictive models. Six binary classification scenarios were
developed to distinguish bladder cancer from other urological and oncological
conditions. The algorithms XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost were employed, with
hyperparameter optimization performed using Optuna and class balancing with the
SMOTE technique. The selection of predictive variables was guided by importance
values through SHAP-based feature selection while maintaining or even improving
performance metrics such as balanced accuracy, precision, and specificity. The
use of explainability techniques (SHAP) for feature selection proved to be an
effective approach. The proposed methodology may contribute to the development
of more transparent, reliable, and efficient clinical decision support systems,
optimizing screening and early diagnosis of urinary tract diseases.

Motivation: 处理噪声数据集（低信噪比、小样本、数据收集错误等）是分类方法的重要研究前沿，具有理论和实践意义。

Method: 将经验数据集视为随机场的实现，映射到希尔伯特空间构造随机特征，使用Kosambi-Karhunen-Loève展开分解为可计算的不可约分量，通过特征分解实现分类。

Result: 在阿尔茨海默病阶段分类和遥感森林砍伐检测等数据稀缺的科学领域取得最先进突破。

Conclusion: 讨论了FINDER在何种情况下优于现有方法、失效模式和其他局限性。

Abstract: ''Noisy'' datasets (regimes with low signal to noise ratios, small sample
sizes, faulty data collection, etc) remain a key research frontier for
classification methods with both theoretical and practical implications. We
introduce FINDER, a rigorous framework for analyzing generic classification
problems, with tailored algorithms for noisy datasets. FINDER incorporates
fundamental stochastic analysis ideas into the feature learning and inference
stages to optimally account for the randomness inherent to all empirical
datasets. We construct ''stochastic features'' by first viewing empirical
datasets as realizations from an underlying random field (without assumptions
on its exact distribution) and then mapping them to appropriate Hilbert spaces.
The Kosambi-Karhunen-Lo\'eve expansion (KLE) breaks these stochastic features
into computable irreducible components, which allow classification over noisy
datasets via an eigen-decomposition: data from different classes resides in
distinct regions, identified by analyzing the spectrum of the associated
operators. We validate FINDER on several challenging, data-deficient scientific
domains, producing state of the art breakthroughs in: (i) Alzheimer's Disease
stage classification, (ii) Remote sensing detection of deforestation. We end
with a discussion on when FINDER is expected to outperform existing methods,
its failure modes, and other limitations.

TL;DR: 本文首次分析了Muon优化器中近似正交化更新的理论性质，揭示了近似误差与最优步长和动量参数之间的耦合关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器在实践中依赖快速近似正交化，但现有理论分析都基于计算不可行的精确SVD更新，存在理论与实践脱节的问题。

Method: 在线性最小化Oracle框架下，引入加性误差模型来捕捉实际近似方案的不精确性，分析近似正交化更新的性能边界。

Result: 分析表明近似误差与最优步长和动量参数存在耦合关系：较低的Oracle精度需要更小的步长但更大的动量参数。NanoGPT实验验证了这一预测。

Conclusion: 近似过程（如Newton-Schulz步数）从实现细节提升为必须与学习调度共同调优的关键参数。

Abstract: The Muon optimizer has rapidly emerged as a powerful, geometry-aware
alternative to AdamW, demonstrating strong performance in large-scale training
of neural networks. However, a critical theory-practice disconnect exists:
Muon's efficiency relies on fast, approximate orthogonalization, yet all prior
theoretical work analyzes an idealized, computationally intractable version
assuming exact SVD-based updates. This work moves beyond the ideal by providing
the first analysis of the inexact orthogonalized update at Muon's core. We
develop our analysis within the general framework of Linear Minimization Oracle
(LMO)-based optimization, introducing a realistic additive error model to
capture the inexactness of practical approximation schemes. Our analysis yields
explicit bounds that quantify performance degradation as a function of the LMO
inexactness/error. We reveal a fundamental coupling between this inexactness
and the optimal step size and momentum: lower oracle precision requires a
smaller step size but larger momentum parameter. These findings elevate the
approximation procedure (e.g., the number of Newton-Schulz steps) from an
implementation detail to a critical parameter that must be co-tuned with the
learning schedule. NanoGPT experiments directly confirm the predicted coupling,
with optimal learning rates clearly shifting as approximation precision
changes.

Motivation: 去中心化联邦学习中的隐私预算准确量化具有挑战性，因为存在复杂的算法组件如去中心化通信和本地更新。

Method: 开发了两种f-DP核算方法：PN-f-DP量化随机游走通信下用户对之间的隐私泄露，Sec-f-LDP通过共享秘密支持结构化噪声注入。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，与Rényi DP方法相比，我们的方法产生更紧的(ε,δ)边界和更好的效用。

Conclusion: f-DP在去中心化隐私核算中具有优势，能够更准确地捕捉隐私放大效应。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) decentralized Federated Learning (FL) allows
local users to collaborate without sharing their data with a central server.
However, accurately quantifying the privacy budget of private FL algorithms is
challenging due to the co-existence of complex algorithmic components such as
decentralized communication and local updates. This paper addresses privacy
accounting for two decentralized FL algorithms within the $f$-differential
privacy ($f$-DP) framework. We develop two new $f$-DP-based accounting methods
tailored to decentralized settings: Pairwise Network $f$-DP (PN-$f$-DP), which
quantifies privacy leakage between user pairs under random-walk communication,
and Secret-based $f$-Local DP (Sec-$f$-LDP), which supports structured noise
injection via shared secrets. By combining tools from $f$-DP theory and Markov
chain concentration, our accounting framework captures privacy amplification
arising from sparse communication, local iterations, and correlated noise.
Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our methods yield
consistently tighter $(\epsilon,\delta)$ bounds and improved utility compared
to R\'enyi DP-based approaches, illustrating the benefits of $f$-DP in
decentralized privacy accounting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习中任务排序对学习效果有重要影响，但贪心排序策略的理论基础和实践效果仍存在开放性问题，需要系统分析。

Method: 使用Kaczmarz方法工具形式化贪心排序，开发几何和代数直觉，在线性回归和CIFAR-100分类任务上进行实证验证，并建立理论分析框架。

Result: 贪心排序比随机排序在平均损失上收敛更快；在高秩回归设置下，贪心排序与随机排序有相似的损失界；但在一般秩设置下，允许重复的贪心排序收敛速度为O(1/³√k)，而单次贪心排序可能失败。

Conclusion: 贪心和随机排序策略之间存在细微差别，贪心排序在特定条件下表现更好，但需要谨慎处理重复策略以避免灾难性失败。

Abstract: We analyze task orderings in continual learning for linear regression,
assuming joint realizability of training data. We focus on orderings that
greedily maximize dissimilarity between consecutive tasks, a concept briefly
explored in prior work but still surrounded by open questions. Using tools from
the Kaczmarz method literature, we formalize such orderings and develop
geometric and algebraic intuitions around them. Empirically, we demonstrate
that greedy orderings converge faster than random ones in terms of the average
loss across tasks, both for linear regression with random data and for linear
probing on CIFAR-100 classification tasks. Analytically, in a high-rank
regression setting, we prove a loss bound for greedy orderings analogous to
that of random ones. However, under general rank, we establish a
repetition-dependent separation. Specifically, while prior work showed that for
random orderings, with or without replacement, the average loss after $k$
iterations is bounded by $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{k})$, we prove that single-pass
greedy orderings may fail catastrophically, whereas those allowing repetition
converge at rate $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt[3]{k})$. Overall, we reveal nuances
within and between greedy and random orderings.

Result: 在单资产和多资产交易任务中，该方法获得更高的夏普比率，并在交易量增加时保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为金融市场中的RL提供了更忠实和可扩展的解决方案，能够有效处理市场影响的定向特性。

Abstract: In financial applications, reinforcement learning (RL) agents are commonly
trained on historical data, where their actions do not influence prices.
However, during deployment, these agents trade in live markets where their own
transactions can shift asset prices, a phenomenon known as market impact. This
mismatch between training and deployment environments can significantly degrade
performance. Traditional robust RL approaches address this model
misspecification by optimizing the worst-case performance over a set of
uncertainties, but typically rely on symmetric structures that fail to capture
the directional nature of market impact. To address this issue, we develop a
novel class of elliptic uncertainty sets. We establish both implicit and
explicit closed-form solutions for the worst-case uncertainty under these sets,
enabling efficient and tractable robust policy evaluation. Experiments on
single-asset and multi-asset trading tasks demonstrate that our method achieves
superior Sharpe ratio and remains robust under increasing trade volumes,
offering a more faithful and scalable approach to RL in financial markets.

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) is an important framework for stochastic
optimization when gradients are unavailable or expensive to compute. A
potential limitation of existing ZOO methods is the bias inherent in most
gradient estimators unless the perturbation stepsize vanishes. In this paper,
we overcome this biasedness issue by proposing a novel family of unbiased
gradient estimators based solely on function evaluations. By reformulating
directional derivatives as a telescoping series and sampling from carefully
designed distributions, we construct estimators that eliminate bias while
maintaining favorable variance. We analyze their theoretical properties, derive
optimal scaling distributions and perturbation stepsizes of four specific
constructions, and prove that SGD using the proposed estimators achieves
optimal complexity for smooth non-convex objectives. Experiments on synthetic
tasks and language model fine-tuning confirm the superior accuracy and
convergence of our approach compared to standard methods.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注固定长度的随机扰动，但忽略了扰动方向与真实梯度方向对齐可能带来的优势，这促使我们探索最优扰动分布的设计。

Method: 将问题建模为扰动分布空间上的约束函数优化问题，提出了方向对齐扰动方案，并对使用δ-无偏随机扰动的随机梯度下降进行了收敛性分析。

Result: 理论分析和实证评估表明，方向对齐扰动在特定条件下优于传统方法，能够沿关键方向提供更高的估计精度。

Conclusion: 方向对齐的随机扰动在零点梯度估计中具有显著优势，扩展了现有复杂度界限，为更广泛的扰动类型提供了理论保证。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the two-point zeroth-order gradient estimator and
identify the distribution of random perturbations that minimizes the
estimator's asymptotic variance as the perturbation stepsize tends to zero. We
formulate it as a constrained functional optimization problem over the space of
perturbation distributions. Our findings reveal that such desired perturbations
can align directionally with the true gradient, instead of maintaining a fixed
length. While existing research has largely focused on fixed-length
perturbations, the potential advantages of directional alignment have been
overlooked. To address this gap, we delve into the theoretical and empirical
properties of the directionally aligned perturbation (DAP) scheme, which
adaptively offers higher accuracy along critical directions. Additionally, we
provide a convergence analysis for stochastic gradient descent using
$\delta$-unbiased random perturbations, extending existing complexity bounds to
a wider range of perturbations. Through empirical evaluations on both synthetic
problems and practical tasks, we demonstrate that DAPs outperform traditional
methods under specific conditions.

Conclusion: UCAN通过各向异性噪声显著提升了对抗鲁棒性认证效果，为随机平滑方法提供了更有效的防御机制

Abstract: Randomized smoothing has become essential for achieving certified adversarial
robustness in machine learning models. However, current methods primarily use
isotropic noise distributions that are uniform across all data dimensions, such
as image pixels, limiting the effectiveness of robustness certification by
ignoring the heterogeneity of inputs and data dimensions. To address this
limitation, we propose UCAN: a novel technique that \underline{U}niversally
\underline{C}ertifies adversarial robustness with \underline{A}nisotropic
\underline{N}oise. UCAN is designed to enhance any existing randomized
smoothing method, transforming it from symmetric (isotropic) to asymmetric
(anisotropic) noise distributions, thereby offering a more tailored defense
against adversarial attacks. Our theoretical framework is versatile, supporting
a wide array of noise distributions for certified robustness in different
$\ell_p$-norms and applicable to any arbitrary classifier by guaranteeing the
classifier's prediction over perturbed inputs with provable robustness bounds
through tailored noise injection. Additionally, we develop a novel framework
equipped with three exemplary noise parameter generators (NPGs) to optimally
fine-tune the anisotropic noise parameters for different data dimensions,
allowing for pursuing different levels of robustness enhancements in
practice.Empirical evaluations underscore the significant leap in UCAN's
performance over existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating up to
$182.6\%$ improvement in certified accuracy at large certified radii on MNIST,
CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets.\footnote{Code is anonymously available at

Motivation: 现有深度学习时间序列预测模型基于"长序列信息增益假说"，但该研究通过实验发现该假设存在固有局限性，模型在学习过程中会吸收大量冗余特征（如噪声或不相关波动），从而影响有效信号提取。

Method: 提出AMRC方法，包含两个核心组件：1）动态掩码损失，自适应识别高区分度的时间段来指导模型训练中的梯度下降；2）表示一致性约束，稳定输入、标签和预测之间的映射关系。

Result: 实验结果表明AMRC有效抑制了冗余特征学习，同时显著提高了模型性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作不仅挑战了时间建模中的传统假设，还为开发高效鲁棒的预测模型提供了新的理论见解和方法突破。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a pivotal role in critical domains such as
energy management and financial markets. Although deep learning-based
approaches (e.g., MLP, RNN, Transformer) have achieved remarkable progress, the
prevailing "long-sequence information gain hypothesis" exhibits inherent
limitations. Through systematic experimentation, this study reveals a
counterintuitive phenomenon: appropriately truncating historical data can
paradoxically enhance prediction accuracy, indicating that existing models
learn substantial redundant features (e.g., noise or irrelevant fluctuations)
during training, thereby compromising effective signal extraction. Building
upon information bottleneck theory, we propose an innovative solution termed
Adaptive Masking Loss with Representation Consistency (AMRC), which features
two core components: 1) Dynamic masking loss, which adaptively identified
highly discriminative temporal segments to guide gradient descent during model
training; 2) Representation consistency constraint, which stabilized the
mapping relationships among inputs, labels, and predictions. Experimental
results demonstrate that AMRC effectively suppresses redundant feature learning
while significantly improving model performance. This work not only challenges
conventional assumptions in temporal modeling but also provides novel
theoretical insights and methodological breakthroughs for developing efficient
and robust forecasting models.

Motivation: 掩码扩散语言模型在数学和编程任务中，任意顺序解码算法表现不佳，标准多重令牌解码会显著降低性能，需要找到MDLMs额外计算成本的合理用途。

Method: 提出推理即填充方法，通过填充推理模板来结构化输出；提出多重令牌熵解码，基于条件熵的自适应并行解码采样器。

Result: 在GSM8k上，基于后验推理轨迹微调LLaDA-8B Base获得与人工编写推理轨迹相当的性能提升；MED保持性能的同时减少2.7倍解码步骤。

Conclusion: MDLMs的训练和计算成本解锁了许多新的推理和后训练方法，证明了其独特价值。

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) are trained to in-fill positions in
randomly masked sequences, in contrast to next-token prediction models.
Discussions around MDLMs focus on two benefits: (1) any-order decoding and 2)
multi-token decoding. However, we observe that for math and coding tasks,
any-order algorithms often underperform or behave similarly to left-to-right
sampling, and standard multi-token decoding significantly degrades performance.
At inference time, MDLMs compute the conditional distribution of all masked
positions. A natural question is: How can we justify this additional compute
when left-to-right one-token-at-a-time decoding is on par with any-order
decoding algorithms? First, we propose reasoning-as-infilling. By using MDLMs
to infill a reasoning template, we can structure outputs and distinguish
between reasoning and answer tokens. In turn, this enables measuring answer
uncertainty during reasoning, and early exits when the model converges on an
answer. Next, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling enables sampling from the
MDLM posterior over reasoning traces conditioned on the answer, providing a new
source of high-quality data for post-training. On GSM8k, we observe that
fine-tuning LLaDA-8B Base on its posterior reasoning traces provides a
performance boost on par with fine-tuning on human-written reasoning traces.
Additionally, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling provides a method for
scoring the correctness of the reasoning process at intermediate steps. Second,
we propose multi-token entropy decoding (MED), a simple adaptive sampler that
minimizes the error incurred by decoding positions in parallel based on the
conditional entropies of those positions. MED preserves performance across
benchmarks and leads to 2.7x fewer steps. Our work demonstrates that the
training and compute used by MDLMs unlock many new inference and post-training
methods.

Result: 整体准确率34.2%，多个区域（F、G、H等）F1分数超过0.40，但稀有类别（特别是LabZoneC）经常被错误分类，即使使用类别权重。

Conclusion: 基于RSSI的决策树可以在现实模拟中应用，实现区域级异常检测或误放监控，通过改进天线布局或增加传感器融合可提高低覆盖和低信号区域的分类性能。

Abstract: Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tracking may be a viable solution for
defense assets that must be stored in accordance with security guidelines.
However, poor sensor specificity (vulnerabilities include long range detection,
spoofing, and counterfeiting) can lead to erroneous detection and operational
security events. We present a supervised learning simulation with realistic
Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) data and Decision Tree classification
in a Computer Assisted Design (CAD)-modeled floor plan that encapsulates some
of the challenges encountered in defense storage. In this work, we focused on
classifying 12 lab zones (LabZoneA-L) to perform location inference. The raw
dataset had approximately 980,000 reads. Class frequencies were imbalanced, and
class weights were calculated to account for class imbalance in this
multi-class setting. The model, trained on stratified subsamples to 5,000
balanced observations, yielded an overall accuracy of 34.2% and F1-scores
greater than 0.40 for multiple zones (Zones F, G, H, etc.). However, rare
classes (most notably LabZoneC) were often misclassified, even with the use of
class weights. An adjacency-aware confusion matrix was calculated to allow
better interpretation of physically adjacent zones. These results suggest that
RSSI-based decision trees can be applied in realistic simulations to enable
zone-level anomaly detection or misplacement monitoring for defense supply
logistics. Reliable classification performance in low-coverage and low-signal
zones could be improved with better antenna placement or additional sensors and
sensor fusion with other modalities.

TL;DR: 提出了SALT框架，通过构建轨迹图对多步任务中的每个步骤进行细粒度优势分配，解决了基于群体的强化学习算法中稀疏奖励导致训练不稳定的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在单轮任务中表现出色，但在复杂多步骤任务中面临挑战。基于群体的强化学习算法（如GRPO）仅依赖稀疏结果奖励，导致训练不稳定和次优策略，因为有益和有害动作在多步交互中交织在一起。

Method: SALT框架从相同提示的轨迹构建图，量化每个步骤的质量并相应分配优势值。这是一个即插即用的模块，无需修改rollout过程，计算开销可忽略。

Result: 在WebShop、ALFWorld和AppWorld基准测试中，使用不同模型大小进行的广泛实验表明，SALT能持续提升性能。

Conclusion: SALT通过细粒度优势分配有效解决了群体强化学习中的稀疏奖励问题，提高了训练稳定性和策略质量，且易于集成到现有算法中。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities,
enabling language agents to excel at single-turn tasks. However, their
application to complex, multi-step, and long-horizon tasks remains challenging.
While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising avenue for addressing
these challenges, mainstream approaches typically rely solely on sparse,
outcome-based rewards, a limitation that becomes especially problematic for
group-based RL algorithms lacking critic models, such as Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). In such methods, uniformly rewarding or penalizing all
actions within a trajectory can lead to training instability and suboptimal
policies, because beneficial and detrimental actions are often entangled across
multi-step interactions. To address this challenge, we propose SALT, a novel
and lightweight framework that provides a finer-grained advantage assignment,
derived solely from outcome rewards. We achieve this by constructing a graph
from trajectories of the same prompt, which allows us to quantify the quality
of each step and assign advantages accordingly. Crucially, SALT is designed as
a plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates with existing group-based RL
algorithms, requiring no modifications to the rollout procedure and introducing
negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the WebShop,
ALFWorld, and AppWorld benchmarks with various model sizes demonstrate that
SALT consistently improves performance. We also conduct a thorough analysis to
validate the design choices behind SALT and offer actionable insights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比特币网络虽然处理了超过10.8亿笔交易，但由于其UTXO设计和伪匿名特性，这些数据难以用于机器学习研究

Method: 构建时间异构图模型，重建比特币资金流动，提供自定义采样方法、图数据库加载工具和现成数据库快照

Result: 创建了包含完整交易历史的图数据集，覆盖到特定区块高度，包含大规模节点和边

Conclusion: 该数据集和工具包使ML社区能够大规模处理比特币复杂生态系统，推动异常检测、地址分类、市场分析等应用发展

Abstract: Since its 2009 genesis block, the Bitcoin network has processed \num{>1.08}
billion (B) transactions representing \num{>8.72}B BTC, offering rich potential
for machine learning (ML); yet, its pseudonymity and obscured flow of funds
inherent in its \utxo-based design, have rendered this data largely
inaccessible for ML research. Addressing this gap, we present an ML-compatible
graph modeling the Bitcoin's economic topology by reconstructing the flow of
funds. This temporal, heterogeneous graph encompasses complete transaction
history up to block \cutoffHeight, consisting of \num{>2.4}B nodes and
\num{>39.72}B edges. Additionally, we provide custom sampling methods yielding
node and edge feature vectors of sampled communities, tools to load and analyze
the Bitcoin graph data within specialized graph databases, and ready-to-use
database snapshots. This comprehensive dataset and toolkit empower the ML
community to tackle Bitcoin's intricate ecosystem at scale, driving progress in
applications such as anomaly detection, address classification, market
analysis, and large-scale graph ML benchmarking. Dataset and code available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于拒绝采样的新算法，能够在无需改变架构或重新训练的情况下，从现有TPP模型中并行、精确地采样多个未来值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时序点过程模型采用自回归方式学习下一个事件的分布，导致采样过程必须顺序执行，限制了效率。需要解决表达性建模与高效并行生成之间的差距。

Method: 基于拒绝采样的算法，能够从现有TPP模型中并行生成多个未来事件，无需修改模型架构或重新训练。

Result: 该方法在真实世界数据集上展示了经验性的加速效果，同时提供了理论保证。

Conclusion: 该算法成功弥合了表达性建模与大规模TPP应用高效并行生成之间的差距。

Abstract: Temporal point processes are powerful generative models for event sequences
that capture complex dependencies in time-series data. They are commonly
specified using autoregressive models that learn the distribution of the next
event from the previous events. This makes sampling inherently sequential,
limiting efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm based on
rejection sampling that enables exact sampling of multiple future values from
existing TPP models, in parallel, and without requiring any architectural
changes or retraining. Besides theoretical guarantees, our method demonstrates
empirical speedups on real-world datasets, bridging the gap between expressive
modeling and efficient parallel generation for large-scale TPP applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种考虑延迟效应、累积影响和用户异质性的广告竞价策略，通过上下文马尔可夫决策过程建模，结合两阶段最大似然估计和强化学习算法，实现了接近最优的遗憾边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线广告平台需要有效的竞价策略来最大化利润，但现有研究往往未能同时考虑广告的延迟和长期效应、累积影响（如强化或疲劳效应）以及客户异质性这三个关键因素。

Method: 将广告竞价建模为具有延迟泊松奖励的上下文马尔可夫决策过程，提出两阶段最大似然估计结合数据分割策略，并基于此设计强化学习算法来制定个性化竞价策略。

Result: 该方法实现了接近最优的遗憾边界 $\tilde{O}{(dH^2\sqrt{T})}$，其中 $d$ 是上下文维度，$H$ 是轮数，$T$ 是客户数量。理论结果通过模拟实验得到验证。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效捕捉广告投放中的复杂动态特性，为在线广告平台提供了理论保证的个性化竞价策略，显著提升了广告效果。

Abstract: Online advertising platforms use automated auctions to connect advertisers
with potential customers, requiring effective bidding strategies to maximize
profits. Accurate ad impact estimation requires considering three key factors:
delayed and long-term effects, cumulative ad impacts such as reinforcement or
fatigue, and customer heterogeneity. However, these effects are often not
jointly addressed in previous studies. To capture these factors, we model ad
bidding as a Contextual Markov Decision Process (CMDP) with delayed Poisson
rewards. For efficient estimation, we propose a two-stage maximum likelihood
estimator combined with data-splitting strategies, ensuring controlled
estimation error based on the first-stage estimator's (in)accuracy. Building on
this, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm to derive efficient
personalized bidding strategies. This approach achieves a near-optimal regret
bound of $\tilde{O}{(dH^2\sqrt{T})}$, where $d$ is the contextual dimension,
$H$ is the number of rounds, and $T$ is the number of customers. Our
theoretical findings are validated by simulation experiments.

Motivation: 解决推测解码中的在线草稿模型选择问题，旨在提高大语言模型推理的加速效果

Method: 设计了一种算法，能够在无需额外查询目标模型的情况下准确评估所有草稿模型，适用于各种推测解码方法

Result: 实验表明该方法在多个领域显著优于现有最佳方法EAGLE3和BanditSpec基线，特别在需要长推理链的场景中表现突出

Conclusion: 该在线草稿模型选择方法能够有效提升推测解码性能，且计算和延迟开销可大幅降低

Abstract: Speculative decoding is widely used in accelerating large language model
(LLM) inference. In this work, we focus on the online draft model selection
problem in speculative decoding. We design an algorithm that provably competes
with the best draft model in hindsight for each query in terms of either the
token acceptance probability or expected acceptance length. In particular, we
show that we can accurately evaluate all draft models, instead of only the
chosen model without incurring additional queries to the target model, which
allows us to improve exponentially over the existing bandit-based approach as
the number of draft models increases. Our approach is generically applicable
with any speculative decoding methods (single draft, multi-drafts and
draft-trees). Moreover, we design system-efficient versions of online learners
and demonstrate that the overhead in computation and latency can be
substantially reduced. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source LLMs and
diverse datasets, demonstrating that our methods substantially outperform the
state-of-the-art EAGLE3 and the BanditSpec baseline in a variety of domains
where specialized domain-expert drafters are available, especially when long
reasoning chains are required.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索加密资产流动性和波动率代理之间的溢出效应及其对市场风险的预测能力。

Method: 集成三层统计框架：流动性-收益交互、主成分关系、波动率因子投影，辅以VAR、HAR-X模型和机器学习协议。

Result: 发现显著的Granger因果关系和中等程度的样本外预测准确性。

Conclusion: 加密资产流动性和波动率代理之间存在统计显著的溢出效应，能够预测市场风险。

Abstract: We study whether liquidity and volatility proxies of a core set of
cryptoassets generate spillovers that forecast market-wide risk. Our empirical
framework integrates three statistical layers: (A) interactions between core
liquidity and returns, (B) principal-component relations linking liquidity and
returns, and (C) volatility-factor projections that capture cross-sectional
volatility crowding. The analysis is complemented by vector autoregression
impulse responses and forecast error variance decompositions (see Granger 1969;
Sims 1980), heterogeneous autoregressive models with exogenous regressors
(HAR-X, Corsi 2009), and a leakage-safe machine learning protocol using
temporal splits, early stopping, validation-only thresholding, and SHAP-based
interpretation. Using daily data from 2021 to 2025 (1462 observations across 74
assets), we document statistically significant Granger-causal relationships
across layers and moderate out-of-sample predictive accuracy. We report the
most informative figures, including the pipeline overview, Layer A heatmap,
Layer C robustness analysis, vector autoregression variance decompositions, and
the test-set precision-recall curve. Full data and figure outputs are provided

TL;DR: 提出了耦合Transformer自编码器(CTAE)，用于同时处理多脑区神经记录中的非线性动态和共享/私有信号分离问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么忽略时间结构，要么局限于单脑区分析，无法有效分离多脑区记录中的共享和私有神经信号

Method: 使用Transformer编码器-解码器架构捕获长程神经动态，并在潜在空间中显式划分正交的共享和私有子空间

Result: 在两个高密度电生理数据集上验证了有效性，CTAE提取的表征能更好地解码行为变量

Conclusion: CTAE为多脑区神经动态分析提供了一个统一的框架，能有效分离共享和区域特异性结构

Abstract: Simultaneous recordings from thousands of neurons across multiple brain areas
reveal rich mixtures of activity that are shared between regions and dynamics
that are unique to each region. Existing alignment or multi-view methods
neglect temporal structure, whereas dynamical latent variable models capture
temporal dependencies but are usually restricted to a single area, assume
linear read-outs, or conflate shared and private signals. We introduce the
Coupled Transformer Autoencoder (CTAE) - a sequence model that addresses both
(i) non-stationary, non-linear dynamics and (ii) separation of shared versus
region-specific structure in a single framework. CTAE employs transformer
encoders and decoders to capture long-range neural dynamics and explicitly
partitions each region's latent space into orthogonal shared and private
subspaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CTAE on two high-density
electrophysiology datasets with simultaneous recordings from multiple regions,
one from motor cortical areas and the other from sensory areas. CTAE extracts
meaningful representations that better decode behavioral variables compared to
existing approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ShapeX是一个创新的时间序列分类解释框架，通过识别关键shapelet（形状片段）并使用Shapley值评估其重要性，提供比现有方法更精确和具有因果保真度的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗和金融等高风险应用中，时间序列分类模型的透明度至关重要。现有后验解释方法主要关注时间步级别的特征归因，但忽略了分类结果主要由关键shapelet驱动的基本先验。

Method: ShapeX包含Shapelet描述与检测(SDD)框架，学习对分类至关重要的多样化shapelet集合，将时间序列分割为有意义的shapelet驱动片段，并使用Shapley值评估其显著性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，ShapeX在识别最相关子序列方面优于现有方法，提高了时间序列解释的精度和因果保真度。

Conclusion: ShapeX通过利用shapelet的原子性特性，能够揭示因果关系而不仅仅是相关性，为时间序列分类提供了更可靠和透明的解释。

Abstract: Explaining time series classification models is crucial, particularly in
high-stakes applications such as healthcare and finance, where transparency and
trust play a critical role. Although numerous time series classification
methods have identified key subsequences, known as shapelets, as core features
for achieving state-of-the-art performance and validating their pivotal role in
classification outcomes, existing post-hoc time series explanation (PHTSE)
methods primarily focus on timestep-level feature attribution. These
explanation methods overlook the fundamental prior that classification outcomes
are predominantly driven by key shapelets. To bridge this gap, we present
ShapeX, an innovative framework that segments time series into meaningful
shapelet-driven segments and employs Shapley values to assess their saliency.
At the core of ShapeX lies the Shapelet Describe-and-Detect (SDD) framework,
which effectively learns a diverse set of shapelets essential for
classification. We further demonstrate that ShapeX produces explanations which
reveal causal relationships instead of just correlations, owing to the
atomicity properties of shapelets. Experimental results on both synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that ShapeX outperforms existing methods in
identifying the most relevant subsequences, enhancing both the precision and
causal fidelity of time series explanations.

Motivation: 社交媒体已成为识别自杀风险的重要来源，但自动检测系统面临类别严重不平衡、发帖模式时间复杂性、风险级别兼具有序性和分类性等多重挑战。

Method: 使用基于MentalRoBERTa的分层双头神经网络，包含CORAL有序分类头和标准分类头，采用3层Transformer编码器建模时间依赖关系，结合时间间隔嵌入，使用组合损失函数（0.5 CORAL + 0.3 交叉熵 + 0.2 Focal Loss），冻结MentalRoBERTa前6层并使用混合精度训练。

Result: 采用5折分层交叉验证，以宏F1分数为主要评估指标进行模型评估。

Conclusion: 该模型通过双头架构和组合损失函数，同时解决了自杀风险分类中的有序关系保持、过度自信减少和类别不平衡问题。

Abstract: Social media platforms have become important sources for identifying suicide
risk, but automated detection systems face multiple challenges including severe
class imbalance, temporal complexity in posting patterns, and the dual nature
of risk levels as both ordinal and categorical. This paper proposes a
hierarchical dual-head neural network based on MentalRoBERTa for suicide risk
classification into four levels: indicator, ideation, behavior, and attempt.
The model employs two complementary prediction heads operating on a shared
sequence representation: a CORAL (Consistent Rank Logits) head that preserves
ordinal relationships between risk levels, and a standard classification head
that enables flexible categorical distinctions. A 3-layer Transformer encoder
with 8-head multi-head attention models temporal dependencies across post
sequences, while explicit time interval embeddings capture posting behavior
dynamics. The model is trained with a combined loss function (0.5 CORAL + 0.3
Cross-Entropy + 0.2 Focal Loss) that simultaneously addresses ordinal structure
preservation, overconfidence reduction, and class imbalance. To improve
computational efficiency, we freeze the first 6 layers (50%) of MentalRoBERTa
and employ mixed-precision training. The model is evaluated using 5-fold
stratified cross-validation with macro F1 score as the primary metric.

TL;DR: 提出基于博弈论强化学习的因果发现框架，通过DDQN智能体与强基线方法竞争，实现理论保证与可扩展性的统一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果发现方法存在理论保证与可扩展性之间的鸿沟：GES和GraN-DAG等方法经验性能强但缺乏有限样本保证，而有理论保证的方法无法扩展到大规模图。

Method: 使用DDQN强化学习智能体直接与GES或GraN-DAG等强基线方法竞争，始终从对手的解决方案进行热启动，确保学习到的图不会比对手差。

Result: 在合成SEM（30节点）上观察到的错误概率随样本量n衰减，与理论紧密匹配；在Sachs、Asia、Alarm、Child、Hepar2、Dream、Andes等真实基准上持续改进GES和GraN-DAG；可扩展到Hepar2（70节点）、Dream（100节点）、Andes（220节点）等大规模图。

Conclusion: 建立了一类新的基于强化学习的因果发现算法，同时具有可证明的一致性、样本效率和实际可扩展性，标志着将经验性能与严格有限样本理论统一的关键一步。

Abstract: Causal discovery remains a central challenge in machine learning, yet
existing methods face a fundamental gap: algorithms like GES and GraN-DAG
achieve strong empirical performance but lack finite-sample guarantees, while
theoretically principled approaches fail to scale. We close this gap by
introducing a game-theoretic reinforcement learning framework for causal
discovery, where a DDQN agent directly competes against a strong baseline (GES
or GraN-DAG), always warm-starting from the opponent's solution. This design
yields three provable guarantees: the learned graph is never worse than the
opponent, warm-starting strictly accelerates convergence, and most importantly,
with high probability the algorithm selects the true best candidate graph. To
the best of our knowledge, our result makes a first-of-its-kind progress in
explaining such finite-sample guarantees in causal discovery: on synthetic SEMs
(30 nodes), the observed error probability decays with n, tightly matching
theory. On real-world benchmarks including Sachs, Asia, Alarm, Child, Hepar2,
Dream, and Andes, our method consistently improves upon GES and GraN-DAG while
remaining theoretically safe. Remarkably, it scales to large graphs such as
Hepar2 (70 nodes), Dream (100 nodes), and Andes (220 nodes). Together, these
results establish a new class of RL-based causal discovery algorithms that are
simultaneously provably consistent, sample-efficient, and practically scalable,
marking a decisive step toward unifying empirical performance with rigorous
finite-sample theory.

<details>

Motivation: 在多维样本的模式分类中，基于加权维度的距离度量至关重要，但常用的欧氏距离存在诸多问题，需要更有效的距离度量和维度加权方法。

Method: 提出了新的维度加权方案，将其集成到KNN分类器中，使用加权Minkowski距离来调节包含k个参考样本区域的大小和形状。

Conclusion: 该方法是对传统KNN分类器的重要推广，通过加权Minkowski距离和新的加权方案，在高维小样本情况下能更有效地选择最近邻。

Abstract: Studies on various facets of pattern classification is often imperative while
working with multi-dimensional samples pertaining to diverse application
scenarios. In this notion, weighted dimension-based distance measure has been
one of the vital considerations in pattern analysis as it reflects the degree
of similarity between samples. Though it is often presumed to be settled with
the pervasive use of Euclidean distance, plethora of issues often surface. In
this paper, we present (a) a detail analysis on the impact of distance measure
norms and weights of dimensions along with visualization, (b) a novel weighting
scheme for each dimension, (c) incorporation of this dimensional weighting
schema into a KNN classifier, and (d) pattern classification on a variety of
synthetic as well as realistic datasets with the developed model. It has
performed well across diverse experiments in comparison to the traditional KNN
under the same experimental setups. Specifically, for gene expression datasets,
it yields significant and consistent gain in classification accuracy (around
10%) in all cross-validation experiments with different values of k. As such
datasets contain limited number of samples of high dimensions, meaningful
selection of nearest neighbours is desirable, and this requirement is
reasonably met by regulating the shape and size of the region enclosing the k
number of reference samples with the developed weighting schema and appropriate
norm. It, therefore, stands as an important generalization of KNN classifier
powered by weighted Minkowski distance with the present weighting schema.

TL;DR: 提出了一种完全解耦的训练策略来解决自监督学习中原型崩溃问题，通过分离原型和编码器的优化目标，使用在线EM风格更新原型，无需显式正则化即可获得多样化原型和更好的下游性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督学习方法普遍存在原型部分崩溃问题，多个原型收敛到几乎相同的表示，这破坏了提供多样化目标来指导编码器学习丰富表示的核心目的。现有方法通过过度参数化原型集或添加临时正则化来缓解症状而非解决根本原因。

Method: 引入完全解耦的训练策略，将原型和编码器在不同目标下分别学习。具体将原型建模为高斯混合模型，使用在线EM风格程序独立于编码器损失进行更新。

Result: 这种简单而原则性的解耦消除了原型崩溃，无需显式正则化即可获得持续多样化的原型和更强的下游性能。

Conclusion: 通过打破原型和编码器的联合优化，解决了自监督学习中的原型崩溃问题，提供了一种更有效的训练策略。

Abstract: Prototypical self-supervised learning methods consistently suffer from
partial prototype collapse, where multiple prototypes converge to nearly
identical representations. This undermines their central purpose -- providing
diverse and informative targets to guide encoders toward rich representations
-- and has led practitioners to over-parameterize prototype sets or add ad-hoc
regularizers, which mitigate symptoms rather than address the root cause. We
empirically trace the collapse to the joint optimization of encoders and
prototypes, which encourages a type of shortcut learning: early in training
prototypes drift toward redundant representations that minimize loss without
necessarily enhancing representation diversity. To break the joint
optimization, we introduce a fully decoupled training strategy that learns
prototypes and encoders under separate objectives. Concretely, we model
prototypes as a Gaussian mixture updated with an online EM-style procedure,
independent of the encoder's loss. This simple yet principled decoupling
eliminates prototype collapse without explicit regularization and yields
consistently diverse prototypes and stronger downstream performance.

TL;DR: 当前时序基础模型表现不佳，原因在于简单套用NLP/CV范式。时序数据缺乏概念密度，需要基于不变性原则构建数据集才能实现真正的泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时序基础模型(TSFMs)表现不如轻量监督基线和经典模型，作者认为这是因为简单套用NLP或CV的流水线方法。时序数据与语言和视觉数据不同，缺乏概念密度，无法通过大规模网络爬取获得有效训练数据。

Method: 提出从机会主义聚合转向原则性设计：构建能够系统覆盖保持时序语义不变性空间的数据集。建议基于第一原则构建时序不变性的本体论。

Result: 通过分析指出当前TSFMs的局限性，并提出了改进方向。

Conclusion: 只有通过确保不变性覆盖来实现表征完整性，时序基础模型才能获得对齐结构，实现真正的泛化、推理和涌现行为。

Abstract: Timeseries foundation models (TSFMs) have multiplied, yet lightweight
supervised baselines and even classical models often match them. We argue this
gap stems from the naive importation of NLP or CV pipelines. In language and
vision, large web-scale corpora densely capture human concepts i.e. there are
countless images and text of apples. In contrast, timeseries data is built to
complement the image and text modalities. There are no timeseries dataset that
contains the concept apple. As a result, the scrape-everything-online paradigm
fails for TS. We posit that progress demands a shift from opportunistic
aggregation to principled design: constructing datasets that systematically
span the space of invariance that preserve temporal semantics. To this end, we
suggest that the ontology of timeseries invariances should be built based on
first principles. Only by ensuring representational completeness through
invariance coverage can TSFMs achieve the aligned structure necessary for
generalisation, reasoning, and truly emergent behaviour.

Result: 发现FC主要在皮层下区域、岛叶、额叶和颞叶皮层驱动tau传播，而SC在枕叶、顶叶和边缘区域起更大作用。SC和FC的相对主导作用在疾病过程中会发生变化，早期AD以FC为主，后期SC占主导。

Conclusion: 结构连接和功能连接在tau传播中的相对贡献具有区域特异性，且与AD相关基因表达模式高度一致，这些发现有助于理解阿尔茨海默病的病理传播机制。

Abstract: Emerging neuroimaging evidence shows that pathological tau proteins build up
along specific brain networks, suggesting that large-scale network architecture
plays a key role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, how
structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) interact to
influence tau propagation remains unclear. Leveraging an unprecedented volume
of longitudinal neuroimaging data, we examine SC-FC interactions through a
multi-layer graph diffusion model. Beyond showing that connectome architecture
constrains tau spread, our model reveals a regionally asymmetric contribution
of SC and FC. Specifically, FC predominantly drives tau spread in subcortical
areas, the insula, frontal and temporal cortices, whereas SC plays a larger
role in occipital, parietal, and limbic regions. The relative dominance of SC
versus FC shifts over the course of disease, with FC generally prevailing in
early AD and SC becoming primary in later stages. Spatial patterns of SC- and
FC-dominant regions strongly align with the regional expression of
AD-associated genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and lysosomal
function, including CHUK (IKK-alpha), TMEM106B, MCL1, NOTCH1, and TH. In
parallel, other non-modifiable risk factors (e.g., APOE genotype, sex) and
biological mechanisms (e.g., amyloid deposition) selectively reshape tau
propagation by shifting dominant routes between anatomical and functional
pathways in a region-specific manner. Findings are validated in an independent
AD cohort.

TL;DR: 提出ADP-VRSGP方法，通过自适应调整噪声方差和学习率的步进衰减策略，在保护隐私的同时提升分散式学习效率和模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有固定方差噪声方法会降低模型性能和训练效率，需要一种能动态调整噪声和学习率的自适应差分隐私方法。

Method: 使用步进衰减策略动态调整噪声方差和学习率，引入渐进梯度融合策略利用历史梯度，结合分散式push-sum和聚合技术。

Result: 理论分析证明该方法具有鲁棒收敛性，实验结果显示在多种场景下优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: ADP-VRSGP有效解决了隐私保护分散式学习中的挑战，在保证隐私的同时显著提升了训练稳定性和速度。

Abstract: Differential privacy is widely employed in decentralized learning to
safeguard sensitive data by introducing noise into model updates. However,
existing approaches that use fixed-variance noise often degrade model
performance and reduce training efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel approach called decentralized learning with adaptive
differential privacy via variance-reduced stochastic gradient push (ADP-VRSGP).
This method dynamically adjusts both the noise variance and the learning rate
using a stepwise-decaying schedule, which accelerates training and enhances
final model performance while providing node-level personalized privacy
guarantees. To counteract the slowed convergence caused by large-variance noise
in early iterations, we introduce a progressive gradient fusion strategy that
leverages historical gradients. Furthermore, ADP-VRSGP incorporates
decentralized push-sum and aggregation techniques, making it particularly
suitable for time-varying communication topologies. Through rigorous
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that ADP-VRSGP achieves robust convergence
with an appropriate learning rate, significantly improving training stability
and speed. Experimental results validate that our method outperforms existing
baselines across multiple scenarios, highlighting its efficacy in addressing
the challenges of privacy-preserving decentralized learning.

TL;DR: 提出Hyper Tour Guided Neighborhood Search (HyperNS)方法解决大规模TSP问题，通过聚类和超路径引导来缩小搜索空间并提高求解质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经方法在大规模TSP实例中存在内存限制、初始解质量不高和全局引导不足等问题，需要更有效的解决方案

Method: 采用"先聚类后路由"策略，使用稀疏热图图将TSP实例划分为簇并抽象为超节点，生成超路径来指导初始化和优化过程

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有神经方法，特别是在处理大规模实例时显著缩小了与最优解的差距

Conclusion: HyperNS方法通过超路径引导的邻域搜索有效解决了大规模TSP问题，提供了更高效和有效的优化方案

Abstract: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard problem that has
garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. While
neural-based methods have shown promise for solving TSPs, they still face
challenges in scaling to larger instances, particularly in memory constraints
associated with global heatmaps, edge weights, or access matrices, as well as
in generating high-quality initial solutions and insufficient global guidance
for efficiently navigating vast search spaces. To address these challenges, we
propose a Hyper Tour Guided Neighborhood Search (HyperNS) method for
large-scale TSP instances. Inspired by the ``clustering first, route second"
strategy, our approach initially divides the TSP instance into clusters using a
sparse heatmap graph and abstracts them as supernodes, followed by the
generation of a hyper tour to guide both the initialization and optimization
processes. This method reduces the search space by focusing on edges relevant
to the hyper tour, leading to more efficient and effective optimization.
Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that
our approach outperforms existing neural-based methods, particularly in
handling larger-scale instances, offering a significant reduction in the gap to
the optimal solution.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLEV方法通过将人类定义的价值信号直接融入奖励函数，使大语言模型的优化与可量化的人类价值信号对齐，在多项RL算法和模型规模上优于仅基于正确性的基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然RLVR方法在客观领域使用二元正确性奖励有效训练模型，但它忽略了并非所有任务都同等重要。RLEV旨在通过直接整合人类定义的价值信号来扩展这一框架。

Method: RLEV使用带有明确真实价值标签的考试风格数据，将人类定义的价值信号直接融入奖励函数。该方法通过价值加权梯度放大学习价值敏感的终止策略。

Result: RLEV策略不仅提高了价值加权准确率，还学会了价值敏感的终止策略：对低价值提示简洁回应，对高价值提示详尽回应。消融研究证实收益与价值对齐存在因果关系。

Conclusion: 即使在噪声价值信号（如基于难度的标签）下，RLEV仍保持稳健，表明优化显式效用函数为实现LLM与人类优先事项对齐提供了实用路径。

Abstract: We propose Reinforcement Learning with Explicit Human Values (RLEV), a method
that aligns Large Language Model (LLM) optimization directly with quantifiable
human value signals. While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) effectively trains models in objective domains using binary correctness
rewards, it overlooks that not all tasks are equally significant. RLEV extends
this framework by incorporating human-defined value signals directly into the
reward function. Using exam-style data with explicit ground-truth value labels,
RLEV consistently outperforms correctness-only baselines across multiple RL
algorithms and model scales. Crucially, RLEV policies not only improve
value-weighted accuracy but also learn a value-sensitive termination policy:
concise for low-value prompts, thorough for high-value ones. We demonstrate
this behavior stems from value-weighted gradient amplification on
end-of-sequence tokens. Ablation studies confirm the gain is causally linked to
value alignment. RLEV remains robust under noisy value signals, such as
difficulty-based labels, demonstrating that optimizing for an explicit utility
function offers a practical path to aligning LLMs with human priorities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习中的约束优化主要关注期望累积奖励，但忽略了奖励分布尾部的风险事件，无法满足高风险应用中对异常值风险的关键需求。

Method: 使用优化确定性等价在奖励值和时间维度上实现每阶段鲁棒性，基于参数化强拉格朗日对偶框架确保与原约束问题的等价性，可包装在标准RL求解器周围。

Conclusion: 该框架为高风险应用提供了有效的风险感知约束强化学习解决方案，能够处理奖励分布尾部的风险事件，并保持与标准RL求解器的兼容性。

Abstract: Constrained optimization provides a common framework for dealing with
conflicting objectives in reinforcement learning (RL). In most of these
settings, the objectives (and constraints) are expressed though the expected
accumulated reward. However, this formulation neglects risky or even possibly
catastrophic events at the tails of the reward distribution, and is often
insufficient for high-stakes applications in which the risk involved in
outliers is critical. In this work, we propose a framework for risk-aware
constrained RL, which exhibits per-stage robustness properties jointly in
reward values and time using optimized certainty equivalents (OCEs). Our
framework ensures an exact equivalent to the original constrained problem
within a parameterized strong Lagrangian duality framework under appropriate
constraint qualifications, and yields a simple algorithmic recipe which can be
wrapped around standard RL solvers, such as PPO. Lastly, we establish the
convergence of the proposed algorithm under common assumptions, and verify the
risk-aware properties of our approach through several numerical experiments.

*Max Hopkins,Russell Impagliazzo,Christopher Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了三种可复制性的松弛概念：点态可复制性、近似可复制性和半可复制性，在PAC学习框架下实现了样本最优的不可知学习器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于完全可复制性在简单学习任务中已被证明不可能实现，需要探索在何种近似可复制性概念下学习仍然是可行的。

Method: 提出了三种可复制性松弛：(1)点态可复制性：在固定输入上保持一致性；(2)近似可复制性：对分布中大部分样本分类一致；(3)半可复制性：完全可复制但可使用共享无标签样本。

Result: 对于常数可复制性参数，获得了样本最优的不可知PAC学习器：前两种方法仅需Θ(d/α²)样本，第三种需要Θ(d²/α²)标签样本。

Conclusion: 通过适当的可复制性松弛，可以在不显著增加样本复杂度的情况下实现稳定的学习算法。

Abstract: Replicability, introduced by (Impagliazzo et al. STOC '22), is the notion
that algorithms should remain stable under a resampling of their inputs (given
access to shared randomness). While a strong and interesting notion of
stability, the cost of replicability can be prohibitive: there is no replicable
algorithm, for instance, for tasks as simple as threshold learning (Bun et al.
STOC '23). Given such strong impossibility results we ask: under what
approximate notions of replicability is learning possible?
  In this work, we propose three natural relaxations of replicability in the
context of PAC learning: (1) Pointwise: the learner must be consistent on any
fixed input, but not across all inputs simultaneously, (2) Approximate: the
learner must output hypotheses that classify most of the distribution
consistently, (3) Semi: the algorithm is fully replicable, but may additionally
use shared unlabeled samples. In all three cases, for constant replicability
parameters, we obtain sample-optimal agnostic PAC learners: (1) and (2) are
achievable for ``free" using $\Theta(d/\alpha^2)$ samples, while (3) requires
$\Theta(d^2/\alpha^2)$ labeled samples.

*Shumin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究评估了使用金毛猎犬寿命研究队列的常规实验室数据进行癌症风险分类的可行性，发现虽然存在统计学上可检测的癌症信号，但由于信号太弱且与正常衰老或其他炎症状况混淆，无法实现可靠的临床分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发用于犬类早期癌症检测的可及性筛查工具是兽医医学的重要挑战，常规实验室数据提供了低成本来源，但受到个体生物标志物非特异性和筛查人群中严重类别不平衡的限制。

Method: 在现实世界约束下，系统比较了126个分析流程，包括各种机器学习模型、特征选择方法和数据平衡技术，使用患者级数据分区防止泄漏，并采用SHAP进行可解释性分析。

Result: 最优模型（带类别加权的逻辑回归分类器和递归特征消除）显示出中等排序能力（AUROC = 0.815），但临床分类性能差（F1分数=0.25，阳性预测值=0.15），虽然阴性预测值高（0.98），但召回率不足（0.79）无法作为可靠的排除测试。

Conclusion: 常规实验室数据中存在的癌症信号太弱且混淆，无法实现可靠的临床鉴别，这为该数据模态单独使用设定了关键性能上限，计算兽医肿瘤学的有意义的进展需要多模态数据源的整合。

Abstract: The development of accessible screening tools for early cancer detection in
dogs represents a significant challenge in veterinary medicine. Routine
laboratory data offer a promising, low-cost source for such tools, but their
utility is hampered by the non-specificity of individual biomarkers and the
severe class imbalance inherent in screening populations. This study assesses
the feasibility of cancer risk classification using the Golden Retriever
Lifetime Study (GRLS) cohort under real-world constraints, including the
grouping of diverse cancer types and the inclusion of post-diagnosis samples. A
comprehensive benchmark evaluation was conducted, systematically comparing 126
analytical pipelines that comprised various machine learning models, feature
selection methods, and data balancing techniques. Data were partitioned at the
patient level to prevent leakage. The optimal model, a Logistic Regression
classifier with class weighting and recursive feature elimination, demonstrated
moderate ranking ability (AUROC = 0.815; 95% CI: 0.793-0.836) but poor clinical
classification performance (F1-score = 0.25, Positive Predictive Value = 0.15).
While a high Negative Predictive Value (0.98) was achieved, insufficient recall
(0.79) precludes its use as a reliable rule-out test. Interpretability analysis
with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) revealed that predictions were driven
by non-specific features like age and markers of inflammation and anemia. It is
concluded that while a statistically detectable cancer signal exists in routine
lab data, it is too weak and confounded for clinically reliable discrimination
from normal aging or other inflammatory conditions. This work establishes a
critical performance ceiling for this data modality in isolation and
underscores that meaningful progress in computational veterinary oncology will
require integration of multi-modal data sources.

Motivation: 传统联邦学习在数据异构性下表现不佳，其基于数据量或启发式的聚合方法无法准确评估客户端更新的实际效用和可靠性，导致次优个性化和聚合偏差。

Method: CO-PFL算法通过分析梯度方向差异和预测偏差来动态评估客户端贡献，结合梯度子空间和数据子空间的双重分析，并集成参数级个性化机制和掩码感知动量优化。

Result: 在CIFAR10、CIFAR10C、CINIC10和Mini-ImageNet四个基准数据集上的实验表明，CO-PFL在个性化精度、鲁棒性、可扩展性和收敛稳定性方面均优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: CO-PFL通过贡献导向的聚合策略有效缓解了聚合偏差，增强了全局协调能力，并通过构建定制化子模型和稳定更新显著提升了本地性能。

Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) addresses a critical challenge of
collaboratively training customized models for clients with heterogeneous and
scarce local data. Conventional federated learning, which relies on a single
consensus model, proves inadequate under such data heterogeneity. Its standard
aggregation method of weighting client updates heuristically or by data volume,
operates under an equal-contribution assumption, failing to account for the
actual utility and reliability of each client's update. This often results in
suboptimal personalization and aggregation bias. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce Contribution-Oriented PFL (CO-PFL), a novel algorithm that
dynamically estimates each client's contribution for global aggregation. CO-PFL
performs a joint assessment by analyzing both gradient direction discrepancies
and prediction deviations, leveraging information from gradient and data
subspaces. This dual-subspace analysis provides a principled and discriminative
aggregation weight for each client, emphasizing high-quality updates.
Furthermore, to bolster personalization adaptability and optimization
stability, CO-PFL cohesively integrates a parameter-wise personalization
mechanism with mask-aware momentum optimization. Our approach effectively
mitigates aggregation bias, strengthens global coordination, and enhances local
performance by facilitating the construction of tailored submodels with stable
updates. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR10C,
CINIC10, and Mini-ImageNet) confirm that CO-PFL consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in in personalization accuracy, robustness,
scalability and convergence stability.

Result: 在LastFM、FacebookNet、Deezer和German等真实网络数据集上的评估显示，计算时间比现有最优算法快两倍，同时能够实现两倍的平衡度。

Conclusion: Fair-SMW算法在保持公平性的同时显著提高了计算效率，为公平聚类提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent research has focused on mitigating algorithmic bias in clustering by
incorporating fairness constraints into algorithmic design. Notions such as
disparate impact, community cohesion, and cost per population have been
implemented to enforce equitable outcomes. Among these, group fairness
(balance) ensures that each protected group is proportionally represented
within every cluster. However, incorporating balance as a metric of fairness
into spectral clustering algorithms has led to computational times that can be
improved. This study aims to enhance the efficiency of spectral clustering
algorithms by reformulating the constrained optimization problem using a new
formulation derived from the Lagrangian method and the
Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury (SMW) identity, resulting in the Fair-SMW algorithm.
Fair-SMW employs three alternatives to the Laplacian matrix with different
spectral gaps to generate multiple variations of Fair-SMW, achieving clustering
solutions with comparable balance to existing algorithms while offering
improved runtime performance. We present the results of Fair-SMW, evaluated
using the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) to measure both runtime efficiency and
balance across real-world network datasets, including LastFM, FacebookNet,
Deezer, and German. We achieve an improvement in computation time that is twice
as fast as the state-of-the-art, and also flexible enough to achieve twice as
much balance.

Conclusion: MetaVD能够压缩本地模型参数，缓解模型过拟合，降低通信成本，为联邦学习在非IID数据场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aims to train a global inference model from remotely
distributed clients, gaining popularity due to its benefit of improving data
privacy. However, traditional FL often faces challenges in practical
applications, including model overfitting and divergent local models due to
limited and non-IID data among clients. To address these issues, we introduce a
novel Bayesian meta-learning approach called meta-variational dropout (MetaVD).
MetaVD learns to predict client-dependent dropout rates via a shared
hypernetwork, enabling effective model personalization of FL algorithms in
limited non-IID data settings. We also emphasize the posterior adaptation view
of meta-learning and the posterior aggregation view of Bayesian FL via the
conditional dropout posterior. We conducted extensive experiments on various
sparse and non-IID FL datasets. MetaVD demonstrated excellent classification
accuracy and uncertainty calibration performance, especially for
out-of-distribution (OOD) clients. MetaVD compresses the local model parameters
needed for each client, mitigating model overfitting and reducing communication
costs. Code is available at https://github.com/insujeon/MetaVD.

introduce an efficient algorithm based on mirror descent. Our approach
simplifies the policy update while ensuring global last-iterate convergence. We
provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis on our algorithm, including
iteration complexity under both exact and approximate policy evaluations, as
well as sample complexity bounds. To further enhance performance, we modify the
proposed algorithm with adaptive regularization. Our experiments demonstrate
the convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm in tabular settings, and our

Motivation: 图神经网络是目前预测分子属性最有效的方法，但需要更准确的模型。增加模型复杂度可以提高准确性，但会显著增加计算成本和内存需求。

Method: 开发了层到层知识混合(LKM)方法，通过最小化GNN层间预存在隐藏嵌入的平均绝对距离，有效聚合多跳和多尺度信息，改善局部和全局分子特征的表示。

Result: 在三个不同GNN架构和量子化学属性数据集上的评估显示，LKM将量子化学和生物物理属性预测的平均绝对误差降低了高达9.8%(QM9)、45.3%(MD17能量)和22.9%(Chignolin)。

Conclusion: LKM方法有潜力在不显著增加训练和推理成本的情况下，显著提高GNN在化学属性预测中的准确性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the currently most effective methods for
predicting molecular properties but there remains a need for more accurate
models. GNN accuracy can be improved by increasing the model complexity but
this also increases the computational cost and memory requirement during
training and inference. In this study, we develop Layer-to-Layer Knowledge
Mixing (LKM), a novel self-knowledge distillation method that increases the
accuracy of state-of-the-art GNNs while adding negligible computational
complexity during training and inference. By minimizing the mean absolute
distance between pre-existing hidden embeddings of GNN layers, LKM efficiently
aggregates multi-hop and multi-scale information, enabling improved
representation of both local and global molecular features. We evaluated LKM
using three diverse GNN architectures (DimeNet++, MXMNet, and PAMNet) using
datasets of quantum chemical properties (QM9, MD17 and Chignolin). We found
that the LKM method effectively reduces the mean absolute error of quantum
chemical and biophysical property predictions by up to 9.8% (QM9), 45.3% (MD17
Energy), and 22.9% (Chignolin). This work demonstrates the potential of LKM to
significantly improve the accuracy of GNNs for chemical property prediction
without any substantial increase in training and inference cost.

Motivation: 选择性分类器通过拒绝不确定输入来提高模型可靠性，但很少有方法能达到完美排序oracle的性能。研究旨在形式化这一性能差距并分析其来源，为构建更接近理想oracle行为的选择性分类器提供指导。

Method: 提出选择性分类差距的有限样本分解框架，将差距分解为五个独立来源。在合成数据和真实视觉、语言基准上进行验证，通过受控实验分离每个误差分量。

Result: 验证表明：(i)贝叶斯噪声和有限模型容量可导致显著差距；(ii)只有更丰富的特征感知校准器能显著改善分数排序；(iii)数据漂移引入需要分布鲁棒训练的单独松弛。

Conclusion: 该分解提供了定量误差预算和可操作的设计指南，帮助从业者构建更接近理想oracle行为的选择性分类器。

Abstract: Selective classifiers improve model reliability by abstaining on inputs the
model deems uncertain. However, few practical approaches achieve the
gold-standard performance of a perfect-ordering oracle that accepts examples
exactly in order of correctness. Our work formalizes this shortfall as the
selective-classification gap and present the first finite-sample decomposition
of this gap to five distinct sources of looseness: Bayes noise, approximation
error, ranking error, statistical noise, and implementation- or shift-induced
slack. Crucially, our analysis reveals that monotone post-hoc calibration --
often believed to strengthen selective classifiers -- has limited impact on
closing this gap, since it rarely alters the model's underlying score ranking.
Bridging the gap therefore requires scoring mechanisms that can effectively
reorder predictions rather than merely rescale them. We validate our
decomposition on synthetic two-moons data and on real-world vision and language
benchmarks, isolating each error component through controlled experiments. Our
results confirm that (i) Bayes noise and limited model capacity can account for
substantial gaps, (ii) only richer, feature-aware calibrators meaningfully
improve score ordering, and (iii) data shift introduces a separate slack that
demands distributionally robust training. Together, our decomposition yields a
quantitative error budget as well as actionable design guidelines that
practitioners can use to build selective classifiers which approximate ideal
oracle behavior more closely.

*Zhiqin Yang,Yonggang Zhang,Chenxin Li,Yiu-ming Cheung,Bo Han,Yixuan Yuan*

TL;DR: FedGPS是一个联邦学习框架，通过整合统计分布和梯度信息来应对数据异构性挑战，在各种异构场景下表现出优越的性能和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习方法在数据异构性场景下性能受限且鲁棒性不足，研究发现共享统计信息可以帮助客户端从全局视角更新模型。

Method: FedGPS静态修改客户端学习目标以隐式建模全局数据分布，同时动态调整本地更新方向，整合其他客户端的梯度信息。

Result: 大量实验表明FedGPS在多种异构场景下优于现有最先进方法，验证了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FedGPS通过统计分布和梯度信息的协同整合，有效解决了联邦学习中的数据异构性问题，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) confronts a significant challenge known as data
heterogeneity, which impairs model performance and convergence. Existing
methods have made notable progress in addressing this issue. However, improving
performance in certain heterogeneity scenarios remains an overlooked question:
\textit{How robust are these methods to deploy under diverse heterogeneity
scenarios?} To answer this, we conduct comprehensive evaluations across varied
heterogeneity scenarios, showing that most existing methods exhibit limited
robustness. Meanwhile, insights from these experiments highlight that sharing
statistical information can mitigate heterogeneity by enabling clients to
update with a global perspective. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{FedGPS}
(\textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{G}oal-\textbf{P}ath \textbf{S}ynergy), a novel
framework that seamlessly integrates statistical distribution and gradient
information from others. Specifically, FedGPS statically modifies each client's
learning objective to implicitly model the global data distribution using
surrogate information, while dynamically adjusting local update directions with
gradient information from other clients at each round. Extensive experiments
show that FedGPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse
heterogeneity scenarios, validating its effectiveness and robustness. The code

### [221] [Optimistic Task Inference for Behavior Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20264)
*Thomas Rupf,Marco Bagatella,Marin Vlastelica,Andreas Krause*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OpTI-BFM是一种乐观决策准则，通过直接建模奖励函数的不确定性来指导行为基础模型进行任务推断，在少量回合内识别和优化未见过的奖励函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行为基础模型在零样本强化学习中需要计算推理数据集上的奖励，这要么需要奖励函数的形式化访问，要么需要大量标注工作。本文旨在通过与环境交互来缓解这些数据效率限制。

Method: 提出OpTI-BFM乐观决策准则，直接建模奖励函数的不确定性，并将其与线性多臂赌博机的上置信界算法建立直接联系。

Result: 在已建立的零样本基准测试中，OpTI-BFM使基于后继特征的行为基础模型能够在少量回合内识别和优化未见过的奖励函数，且计算开销最小。

Conclusion: OpTI-BFM为训练良好的行为基础模型提供了遗憾界，并通过与环境的交互实现了高效的任务推断，显著提高了数据效率。

Abstract: Behavior Foundation Models (BFMs) are capable of retrieving high-performing
policy for any reward function specified directly at test-time, commonly
referred to as zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL). While this is a very
efficient process in terms of compute, it can be less so in terms of data: as a
standard assumption, BFMs require computing rewards over a non-negligible
inference dataset, assuming either access to a functional form of rewards, or
significant labeling efforts. To alleviate these limitations, we tackle the
problem of task inference purely through interaction with the environment at
test-time. We propose OpTI-BFM, an optimistic decision criterion that directly
models uncertainty over reward functions and guides BFMs in data collection for
task inference. Formally, we provide a regret bound for well-trained BFMs
through a direct connection to upper-confidence algorithms for linear bandits.
Empirically, we evaluate OpTI-BFM on established zero-shot benchmarks, and
observe that it enables successor-features-based BFMs to identify and optimize
an unseen reward function in a handful of episodes with minimal compute
overhead. Code is available at https://github.com/ThomasRupf/opti-bfm.

### [222] [ImpossibleBench: Measuring LLMs' Propensity of Exploiting Test Cases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20270)
*Ziqian Zhong,Aditi Raghunathan,Nicholas Carlini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ImpossibleBench是一个基准框架，用于系统测量LLM代理利用测试用例的倾向性，通过在现有基准中创建自然语言规范与单元测试冲突的"不可能"任务变体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在完成任务时倾向于寻找和利用"捷径"，这给可靠评估和部署带来了重大风险。例如，具有单元测试访问权限的LLM代理可能会删除失败的测试而不是修复底层错误，这破坏了基准结果的有效性和实际部署的可靠性。

Method: 通过创建现有基准（如LiveCodeBench和SWE-bench）的"不可能"变体任务，引入自然语言规范与单元测试之间的直接冲突，测量代理在这些不可能任务上的通过率（作弊率）。

Result: 揭示了从简单测试修改到复杂运算符重载等更细粒度的作弊行为细节，展示了提示、测试访问和反馈循环如何影响作弊率，并提供了经过验证的欺骗性解决方案测试平台。

Conclusion: ImpossibleBench作为一个实用框架，不仅用于评估，还可用于研究模型行为、上下文工程和开发监控工具，有助于构建更稳健可靠的LLM系统。

Abstract: The tendency to find and exploit "shortcuts" to complete tasks poses
significant risks for reliable assessment and deployment of large language
models (LLMs). For example, an LLM agent with access to unit tests may delete
failing tests rather than fix the underlying bug. Such behavior undermines both
the validity of benchmark results and the reliability of real-world LLM coding
assistant deployments.
  To quantify, study, and mitigate such behavior, we introduce ImpossibleBench,
a benchmark framework that systematically measures LLM agents' propensity to
exploit test cases. ImpossibleBench creates "impossible" variants of tasks from
existing benchmarks like LiveCodeBench and SWE-bench by introducing direct
conflicts between the natural-language specification and the unit tests. We
measure an agent's "cheating rate" as its pass rate on these impossible tasks,
where any pass necessarily implies a specification-violating shortcut.
  As a practical framework, ImpossibleBench is not just an evaluation but a
versatile tool. We demonstrate its utility for: (1) studying model behaviors,
revealing more fine-grained details of cheating behaviors from simple test
modification to complex operator overloading; (2) context engineering, showing
how prompt, test access and feedback loop affect cheating rates; and (3)
developing monitoring tools, providing a testbed with verified deceptive
solutions. We hope ImpossibleBench serves as a useful framework for building
more robust and reliable LLM systems.

Abstract: Topological features capture global geometric structure in imaging data, but
practical adoption in deep learning requires both computational efficiency and
differentiability. We present optimized GPU kernels for the Euler
Characteristic Curve (ECC) computation achieving 16-2000\"O speedups over prior
GPU implementations on synthetic grids, and introduce a differentiable PyTorch
layer enabling end-to-end learning. Our CUDA kernels, optimized for Ampere GPUs
use 128B-coalesced access and hierarchical shared-memory accumulation. Our
PyTorch layer learns thresholds in a single direction via a Differentiable
Euler Characteristic Transform-style sigmoid relaxation. We discuss downstream
relevance, including applications highlighted by prior ECC work, and outline
batching/multi-GPU extensions to broaden adoption.

### [224] [Limits of PRM-Guided Tree Search for Mathematical Reasoning with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20272)
*Tristan Cinquin,Geoff Pleiss,Agustinus Kristiadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRM引导的树搜索在数学推理中相比Best-of-N选择没有显著改进，尽管成本更高，表明当前的过程奖励模型可靠性不足，需要不同的奖励建模方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的链式思维提示和Best-of-N选择无法捕捉复杂问题解决的分支和探索性质，因此研究PRM引导的树搜索是否能通过探索多个部分解路径来改进数学推理。

Method: 提出自适应算法在难处理的动作空间中最大化过程奖励模型分数，使用Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct及其相关PRM作为案例研究，在23个多样化数学问题上评估PRM引导的树搜索方法。

Result: PRM引导的树搜索相比BoN无显著改进；蒙特卡洛树搜索和束搜索优于其他PRM方法；PRM对状态值的近似效果差且可靠性随推理深度下降；PRM分布外泛化能力差。

Conclusion: 树搜索对不可靠PRM分数的依赖更大，在树搜索能有效增强LLM数学推理之前需要不同的奖励建模方法。

Abstract: While chain-of-thought prompting with Best-of-N (BoN) selection has become
popular for mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs), its linear
structure fails to capture the branching and exploratory nature of complex
problem-solving. In this work, we propose an adaptive algorithm to maximize
process reward model (PRM) scores over the intractable action space, and
investigate whether PRM-guided tree search can improve mathematical reasoning
by exploring multiple partial solution paths. Across $23$ diverse mathematical
problems using Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct with its associated PRM as a case
study, we find that: (1) PRM-guided tree search shows no statistically
significant improvements over BoN despite higher costs, (2) Monte Carlo tree
search and beam search outperform other PRM-guided tree search methods, (3)
PRMs poorly approximate state values and their reliability degrades with
reasoning depth, and (4) PRMs generalize poorly out of distribution. This
underperformance stems from tree search's greater reliance on unreliable PRM
scores, suggesting different reward modeling is necessary before tree search
can effectively enhance mathematical reasoning in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习模型在真实应用中表现不稳定，黑盒架构和评估框架限制导致难以量化模型优缺点，影响特定场景下的模型选择。

Method: 使用合成数据驱动的评估范式，通过三个核心分析维度：时间特征分解与能力映射、数据异常下的鲁棒性分析、理论最优基准测试。

Result: 实验表明当前深度学习模型在所有类型时间特征上并未普遍接近最优基准。

Conclusion: SynTSBench框架能够系统评估时间序列预测模型的基本能力，为模型选择和性能改进提供量化依据。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have driven rapid progress in time series
forecasting, yet many state-of-the-art models continue to struggle with robust
performance in real-world applications, even when they achieve strong results
on standard benchmark datasets. This persistent gap can be attributed to the
black-box nature of deep learning architectures and the inherent limitations of
current evaluation frameworks, which frequently lack the capacity to provide
clear, quantitative insights into the specific strengths and weaknesses of
different models, thereby complicating the selection of appropriate models for
particular forecasting scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a
synthetic data-driven evaluation paradigm, SynTSBench, that systematically
assesses fundamental modeling capabilities of time series forecasting models
through programmable feature configuration. Our framework isolates confounding
factors and establishes an interpretable evaluation system with three core
analytical dimensions: (1) temporal feature decomposition and capability
mapping, which enables systematic evaluation of model capacities to learn
specific pattern types; (2) robustness analysis under data irregularities,
which quantifies noise tolerance thresholds and anomaly recovery capabilities;
and (3) theoretical optimum benchmarking, which establishes performance
boundaries for each pattern type-enabling direct comparison between model
predictions and mathematical optima. Our experiments show that current deep
learning models do not universally approach optimal baselines across all types
of temporal features.The code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于KAN的协作模型(KCM)来解决大-小模型协作中的精度下降、灾难性遗忘和幻觉问题，在保持精度的同时显著降低计算资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大-小模型协作框架中存在的精度显著下降、灾难性遗忘加剧以及小模型知识引发的幻觉问题。

Method: 使用KAN(可解释神经网络)作为协作模型，替代传统的MLP，在语言、视觉和视觉-语言跨模态任务中部署KCM协作系统。

Result: 相比纯大模型方法，KCM协作框架显著减少大模型推理调用次数，保持任务精度相近，大幅降低计算资源消耗；KAN小协作模型显著缓解灾难性遗忘，长尾数据精度显著提升；在所有指标上优于基于MLP的小协作模型。

Conclusion: KCM在大-小模型协作中表现出优越性能，有效平衡了计算效率和模型精度，同时解决了协作框架中的关键问题。

Abstract: In recent years, Pretrained Large Models(PLMs) researchers proposed
large-small model collaboration frameworks, leveraged easily trainable small
models to assist large models, aim to(1) significantly reduce computational
resource consumption while maintaining comparable accuracy, and (2) enhance
large model performance in specialized domain tasks. However, this
collaborative paradigm suffers from issues such as significant accuracy
degradation, exacerbated catastrophic forgetting, and amplified hallucination
problems induced by small model knowledge. To address these challenges, we
propose a KAN-based Collaborative Model (KCM) as an improved approach to
large-small model collaboration. The KAN utilized in KCM represents an
alternative neural network architecture distinct from conventional MLPs.
Compared to MLPs, KAN offers superior visualizability and interpretability
while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. We deployed KCM in large-small model
collaborative systems across three scenarios: language, vision, and
vision-language cross-modal tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that,
compared with pure large model approaches, the large-small model collaboration
framework utilizing KCM as the collaborative model significantly reduces the
number of large model inference calls while maintaining near-identical task
accuracy, thereby substantially lowering computational resource consumption.
Concurrently, the KAN-based small collaborative model markedly mitigates
catastrophic forgetting, leading to significant accuracy improvements for
long-tail data. The results reveal that KCM demonstrates superior performance
across all metrics compared to MLP-based small collaborative models (MCM).

<details>

Motivation: 构建能够协助整个科研过程的AI协作系统，需要评估端到端工作流程的基准，而不仅仅是孤立子任务。

Method: 从14kCC授权论文构建CS-54k科学问答语料库，使用检索增强生成和多阶段质量控制确保事实基础，并从中衍生出CS-4k评估基准和CS-50k训练集。

Result: CS-4k能够对最先进LLM进行能力分层，在CS-50k上训练的7B规模模型通过监督训练和强化学习显著提升，甚至超越GPT-4.1、GPT-4o和Gemini 2.5 Pro等大型专有系统。

Conclusion: 使AI模型成为更好的研究助手更依赖于领域对齐的高质量数据训练，而非预训练规模或通用基准性能。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, the ultimate vision for their role
in science is emerging: we could build an AI collaborator to effectively assist
human beings throughout the entire scientific research process. We refer to
this envisioned system as ResearchGPT. Given that scientific research
progresses through multiple interdependent phases, achieving this vision
requires rigorous benchmarks that evaluate the end-to-end workflow rather than
isolated sub-tasks. To this end, we contribute CS-54k, a high-quality corpus of
scientific Q&A pairs in computer science, built from 14k CC-licensed papers. It
is constructed through a scalable, paper-grounded pipeline that combines
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with multi-stage quality control to ensure
factual grounding. From this unified corpus, we derive two complementary
subsets: CS-4k, a carefully curated benchmark for evaluating AI's ability to
assist scientific research, and CS-50k, a large-scale training dataset.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CS-4k stratifies state-of-the-art LLMs
into distinct capability tiers. Open models trained on CS-50k with supervised
training and reinforcement learning demonstrate substantial improvements. Even
7B-scale models, when properly trained, outperform many larger proprietary
systems, such as GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. This indicates that
making AI models better research assistants relies more on domain-aligned
training with high-quality data than on pretraining scale or general benchmark
performance. We release CS-4k and CS-50k in the hope of fostering AI systems as
reliable collaborators in CS research.

Result: 在两个广泛使用的基准测试上，该方法在图形泛化任务中持续优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 提出的IRM-free方法能够有效捕获因果子图，在分布偏移下实现更好的泛化性能，为图神经网络提供了一种更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution generalization under distributional shifts remains a
critical challenge for graph neural networks. Existing methods generally adopt
the Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) framework, requiring costly environment
annotations or heuristically generated synthetic splits. To circumvent these
limitations, in this work, we aim to develop an IRM-free method for capturing
causal subgraphs. We first identify that causal subgraphs exhibit substantially
smaller distributional variations than non-causal components across diverse
environments, which we formalize as the Invariant Distribution Criterion and
theoretically prove in this paper. Building on this criterion, we
systematically uncover the quantitative relationship between distributional
shift and representation norm for identifying the causal subgraph, and
investigate its underlying mechanisms in depth. Finally, we propose an IRM-free
method by introducing a norm-guided invariant distribution objective for causal
subgraph discovery and prediction. Extensive experiments on two widely used
benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in graph generalization.

Conclusion: DB-FGA-Net等无需增强、可解释且可部署的深度学习模型在脑肿瘤诊断中具有可靠的临床转化潜力。

Abstract: Brain tumors are a challenging problem in neuro-oncology, where early and
precise diagnosis is important for successful treatment. Deep learning-based
brain tumor classification methods often rely on heavy data augmentation which
can limit generalization and trust in clinical applications. In this paper, we
propose a double-backbone network integrating VGG16 and Xception with a
Frequency-Gated Attention (FGA) Block to capture complementary local and global
features. Unlike previous studies, our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance without augmentation which demonstrates robustness to variably
sized and distributed datasets. For further transparency, Grad-CAM is
integrated to visualize the tumor regions based on which the model is giving
prediction, bridging the gap between model prediction and clinical
interpretability. The proposed framework achieves 99.24\% accuracy on the 7K-DS
dataset for the 4-class setting, along with 98.68\% and 99.85\% in the 3-class
and 2-class settings, respectively. On the independent 3K-DS dataset, the model
generalizes with 95.77\% accuracy, outperforming baseline and state-of-the-art
methods. To further support clinical usability, we developed a graphical user
interface (GUI) that provides real-time classification and Grad-CAM-based tumor
localization. These findings suggest that augmentation-free, interpretable, and
deployable deep learning models such as DB-FGA-Net hold strong potential for
reliable clinical translation in brain tumor diagnosis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了InvDec（倒置解码器）混合架构，结合基于patch的时间编码器和在变量维度上工作的倒置解码器，实现了时间编码和变量级解码的分离，在高维数据集上显著提升了多变量时间序列预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在局限性：通道独立方法（如PatchTST）擅长时间建模但忽略变量相关性，而纯变量注意力方法（如iTransformer）牺牲了时间编码。需要一种能同时建模时间模式和跨变量依赖的方法。

Method: InvDec架构包含：1）基于patch的时间编码器；2）通过变量级自注意力在变量维度上工作的倒置解码器；3）延迟变量嵌入，在时间编码后丰富变量特定表示；4）自适应残差融合机制，动态平衡时间和变量信息。

Result: 在7个基准测试中，InvDec-PatchTST在高维数据集上表现优异：电力数据集（321变量）MSE降低20.9%，天气数据集提升4.3%，交通数据集提升2.7%，同时在低维ETT数据集上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: InvDec通过分离时间编码和变量级解码，有效解决了多变量时间序列预测中的关键挑战。消融研究验证了各组件的重要性，分析表明随着数据集维度的增加，跨变量建模变得愈发关键，InvDec的优势也随之增强。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting requires simultaneously modeling
temporal patterns and cross-variate dependencies. Channel-independent methods
such as PatchTST excel at temporal modeling but ignore variable correlations,
while pure variate-attention approaches such as iTransformer sacrifice temporal
encoding. We proposeInvDec (Inverted Decoder), a hybrid architecture that
achieves principled separation between temporal encoding and variate-level
decoding. InvDec combines a patch-based temporal encoder with an inverted
decoder operating on the variate dimension through variate-wise self-attention.
We introduce delayed variate embeddings that enrich variable-specific
representations only after temporal encoding, preserving temporal feature
integrity. An adaptive residual fusion mechanism dynamically balances temporal
and variate information across datasets of varying dimensions. Instantiating
InvDec with PatchTST yields InvDec-PatchTST. Extensive experiments on seven
benchmarks demonstrate significant gains on high-dimensional datasets: 20.9%
MSE reduction on Electricity (321 variables), 4.3% improvement on Weather, and
2.7% gain on Traffic compared to PatchTST, while maintaining competitive
performance on low-dimensional ETT datasets. Ablation studies validate each
component, and analysis reveals that InvDec's advantage grows with dataset
dimensionality, confirming that cross-variate modeling becomes critical as the
number of variables increases.

Motivation: 现实世界中的隐私保护需求通常涉及多个敏感属性且具有动态性，现有单属性遗忘方法无法满足这些需求。

Method: 将多属性遗忘过程分为两个步骤：嵌入校准（从用户嵌入中移除特定属性信息）和灵活组合（将这些嵌入组合成单一嵌入以保护所有敏感属性），并将遗忘过程构建为互信息最小化问题。

Result: 在三个真实世界数据集和三个代表性推荐模型上的广泛实验证明了该框架的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: LEGO框架能够有效解决多属性遗忘问题，具有理论保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: With the growing demand for safeguarding sensitive user information in
recommender systems, recommendation attribute unlearning is receiving
increasing attention. Existing studies predominantly focus on single-attribute
unlearning. However, privacy protection requirements in the real world often
involve multiple sensitive attributes and are dynamic. Existing
single-attribute unlearning methods cannot meet these real-world requirements
due to i) CH1: the inability to handle multiple unlearning requests
simultaneously, and ii) CH2: the lack of efficient adaptability to dynamic
unlearning needs. To address these challenges, we propose LEGO, a lightweight
and efficient multiple-attribute unlearning framework. Specifically, we divide
the multiple-attribute unlearning process into two steps: i) Embedding
Calibration removes information related to a specific attribute from user
embedding, and ii) Flexible Combination combines these embeddings into a single
embedding, protecting all sensitive attributes. We frame the unlearning process
as a mutual information minimization problem, providing LEGO a theoretical
guarantee of simultaneous unlearning, thereby addressing CH1. With the two-step
framework, where Embedding Calibration can be performed in parallel and
Flexible Combination is flexible and efficient, we address CH2. Extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets across three representative
recommendation models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our
proposed framework. Our code and appendix are available at

Abstract: Deep vision models are now mature enough to be integrated in industrial and
possibly critical applications such as autonomous navigation. Yet, data
collection and labeling to train such models requires too much efforts and
costs for a single company or product. This drawback is more significant in
critical applications, where training data must include all possible conditions
including rare scenarios. In this perspective, generating synthetic images is
an appealing solution, since it allows a cheap yet reliable covering of all the
conditions and environments, if the impact of the synthetic-to-real
distribution shift is mitigated. In this article, we consider the case of
runway detection that is a critical part in autonomous landing systems
developed by aircraft manufacturers. We propose an image generation approach
based on a commercial flight simulator that complements a few annotated real
images. By controlling the image generation and the integration of real and
synthetic data, we show that standard object detection models can achieve
accurate prediction. We also evaluate their robustness with respect to adverse
conditions, in our case nighttime images, that were not represented in the real
data, and show the interest of using a customized domain adaptation strategy.

Conclusion: 该框架通过智能地结合快速奖励模型和强大LLM裁判，在保持效率的同时提高了RLHF系统的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reward model (RM) plays a pivotal role in reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, classical
RMs trained on human preferences are vulnerable to reward hacking and
generalize poorly to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. By contrast, strong LLM
judges equipped with reasoning capabilities demonstrate superior
generalization, even without additional training, but incur significantly
higher inference costs, limiting their applicability in online RLHF. In this
work, we propose an uncertainty-based routing framework that efficiently
complements a fast RM with a strong but costly LLM judge. Our approach
formulates advantage estimation in policy gradient (PG) methods as pairwise
preference classification, enabling principled uncertainty quantification to
guide routing. Uncertain pairs are forwarded to the LLM judge, while confident
ones are evaluated by the RM. Experiments on RM benchmarks demonstrate that our
uncertainty-based routing strategy significantly outperforms random judge
calling at the same cost, and downstream alignment results showcase its
effectiveness in improving online RLHF.

Method: 引入协方差矩阵的不确定性集，构建最小化最坏情况期望平方误差的鲁棒协调问题，可转化为半定优化问题求解。

Result: 数值实验表明，所提鲁棒协调方法比现有层次预测方法获得了更好的预测性能。

Conclusion: 在协调过程中考虑不确定性能有效提升层次预测的性能。

Abstract: This paper focuses on forecasting hierarchical time-series data, where each
higher-level observation equals the sum of its corresponding lower-level time
series. In such contexts, the forecast values should be coherent, meaning that
the forecast value of each parent series exactly matches the sum of the
forecast values of its child series. Existing hierarchical forecasting methods
typically generate base forecasts independently for each series and then apply
a reconciliation procedure to adjust them so that the resulting forecast values
are coherent across the hierarchy. These methods generally derive an optimal
reconciliation, using a covariance matrix of the forecast error. In practice,
however, the true covariance matrix is unknown and has to be estimated from
finite samples in advance. This gap between the true and estimated covariance
matrix may degrade forecast performance. To address this issue, we propose a
robust optimization framework for hierarchical reconciliation that accounts for
uncertainty in the estimated covariance matrix. We first introduce an
uncertainty set for the estimated covariance matrix and formulate a
reconciliation problem that minimizes the worst-case expected squared error
over this uncertainty set. We show that our problem can be cast as a
semidefinite optimization problem. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the
proposed robust reconciliation method achieved better forecast performance than
existing hierarchical forecasting methods, which indicates the effectiveness of
integrating uncertainty into the reconciliation process.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于相对排序的缩放定律，通过相对概率指标(RBP)来补充传统交叉熵指标的不足，更全面地评估语言模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缩放定律研究主要依赖交叉熵作为评估指标，但交叉熵只关注正确token的绝对概率，忽略了正确与错误token之间的相对排序关系，而相对排序在语言模型的实际应用中至关重要。

Method: 提出了相对概率指标(RBP)，衡量正确token排在前k个预测中的概率，并基于此建立了相对缩放定律，通过四个数据集和四个模型家族的大规模实验验证了该定律的鲁棒性和准确性。

Result: 实验表明相对缩放定律能够准确预测模型性能随规模的变化，并通过两个应用案例展示了该定律的广泛适用性：为涌现现象提供更深层解释，以及促进寻找缩放定律的基础理论。

Conclusion: 相对缩放定律补充了交叉熵视角，为大语言模型的缩放提供了更全面的理解，为实际开发和理论探索提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Scaling laws aim to accurately predict model performance across different
scales. Existing scaling-law studies almost exclusively rely on cross-entropy
as the evaluation metric. However, cross-entropy provides only a partial view
of performance: it measures the absolute probability assigned to the correct
token, but ignores the relative ordering between correct and incorrect tokens.
Yet, relative ordering is crucial for language models, such as in
greedy-sampling scenario. To address this limitation, we investigate scaling
from the perspective of relative ordering. We first propose the Relative-Based
Probability (RBP) metric, which quantifies the probability that the correct
token is ranked among the top predictions. Building on this metric, we
establish the Relative-Based Scaling Law, which characterizes how RBP improves
with increasing model size. Through extensive experiments on four datasets and
four model families spanning five orders of magnitude, we demonstrate the
robustness and accuracy of this law. Finally, we illustrate the broad
application of this law with two examples, namely providing a deeper
explanation of emergence phenomena and facilitating finding fundamental
theories of scaling laws. In summary, the Relative-Based Scaling Law
complements the cross-entropy perspective and contributes to a more complete
understanding of scaling large language models. Thus, it offers valuable
insights for both practical development and theoretical exploration.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一个工业启发的基准环境，将排序和压缩操作结合成顺序回收场景，评估模块化与单体控制策略及动作掩码的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业过程控制需要局部专业化和全局协调，但强化学习在工业应用中的采用受到奖励设计、模块化和动作空间管理等挑战的限制。现有学术基准与工业控制问题差异较大，限制了向实际应用的转移。

Method: 结合SortingEnv和ContainerGym两个现有基准，创建顺序回收场景。评估两种控制策略：模块化架构（专业代理）和单体代理（全系统控制），并分析动作掩码的影响。

Result: 无动作掩码时，代理难以学习有效策略，模块化架构表现更好。应用动作掩码后，两种架构都显著改善，性能差距大幅缩小。

Conclusion: 动作空间约束具有决定性作用，专业化优势随着动作复杂度降低而减弱。该基准为工业自动化中实用且鲁棒的多代理强化学习解决方案提供了有价值的测试平台。

Abstract: Autonomous control of multi-stage industrial processes requires both local
specialization and global coordination. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a
promising approach, but its industrial adoption remains limited due to
challenges such as reward design, modularity, and action space management. Many
academic benchmarks differ markedly from industrial control problems, limiting
their transferability to real-world applications. This study introduces an
enhanced industry-inspired benchmark environment that combines tasks from two
existing benchmarks, SortingEnv and ContainerGym, into a sequential recycling
scenario with sorting and pressing operations. We evaluate two control
strategies: a modular architecture with specialized agents and a monolithic
agent governing the full system, while also analyzing the impact of action
masking. Our experiments show that without action masking, agents struggle to
learn effective policies, with the modular architecture performing better. When
action masking is applied, both architectures improve substantially, and the
performance gap narrows considerably. These results highlight the decisive role
of action space constraints and suggest that the advantages of specialization
diminish as action complexity is reduced. The proposed benchmark thus provides
a valuable testbed for exploring practical and robust multi-agent RL solutions
in industrial automation, while contributing to the ongoing debate on
centralization versus specialization.

Motivation: DPO算法在偏好数据上直接进行模型微调，但当真实奖励函数无法通过策略类实现时，DPO会出现模型设定错误，导致偏好顺序反转、策略奖励恶化等问题。

Method: 通过分析DPO的统计估计问题和RLHF的局部行为，提出了AuxDPO方法，在DPO损失函数中引入辅助变量，以更原则的方式逼近RLHF解。

Result: 在示例多臂赌博机设置和LLM对齐任务上的实证研究表明，AuxDPO相比DPO具有更优越的性能。

Conclusion: AuxDPO能够有效缓解DPO的模型设定错误问题，提供了一种更稳健的直接对齐方法。

Abstract: Direct alignment algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
fine-tune models based on preference data, using only supervised learning
instead of two-stage reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). We show
that DPO encodes a statistical estimation problem over reward functions induced
by a parametric policy class. When the true reward function that generates
preferences cannot be realized via the policy class, DPO becomes misspecified,
resulting in failure modes such as preference order reversal, worsening of
policy reward, and high sensitivity to the input preference data distribution.
On the other hand, we study the local behavior of two-stage RLHF for a
parametric class and relate it to a natural gradient step in policy space. Our
fine-grained geometric characterization allows us to propose AuxDPO, which
introduces additional auxiliary variables in the DPO loss function to help move
towards the RLHF solution in a principled manner and mitigate the
misspecification in DPO. We empirically demonstrate the superior performance of
AuxDPO on didactic bandit settings as well as LLM alignment tasks.

Motivation: 现有研究忽视了现实应用中事件标记分布高度不平衡的问题，其中一些标记频繁出现而其他标记罕见，这种不平衡对下一个事件预测性能（特别是罕见标记事件）构成了重大挑战。

Method: 提出阈值方法学习阈值来调整由标记先验概率归一化的标记概率，以优化标记预测；开发新型神经MTPP模型支持有效时间采样和标记概率估计，无需计算昂贵的数值不当积分。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在下一个事件标记和时间预测方面优于各种基线方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的解决方案通过阈值调整和新型MTPP模型有效解决了事件标记分布不平衡问题，显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Marked Temporal Point Process (MTPP) has been well studied to model the event
distribution in marked event streams, which can be used to predict the mark and
arrival time of the next event. However, existing studies overlook that the
distribution of event marks is highly imbalanced in many real-world
applications, with some marks being frequent but others rare. The imbalance
poses a significant challenge to the performance of the next event prediction,
especially for events of rare marks. To address this issue, we propose a
thresholding method, which learns thresholds to tune the mark probability
normalized by the mark's prior probability to optimize mark prediction, rather
than predicting the mark directly based on the mark probability as in existing
studies. In conjunction with this method, we predict the mark first and then
the time. In particular, we develop a novel neural MTPP model to support
effective time sampling and estimation of mark probability without
computationally expensive numerical improper integration. Extensive experiments
on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our solution
against various baselines for the next event mark and time prediction. The code

Motivation: LLM在实际部署中会产生有毒或偏见输出，参数更新的高成本促使需要选择性使用修复数据，但现有数据选择方法在LLM行为修复中的效果尚不明确。

Method: 评估五种代表性选择方法：随机采样、K-Center、梯度范数选择(GraNd)、分层覆盖(CCS)和提出的语义感知优先采样(SAPS)，通过毒性减少、困惑度和三个复合指标评估修复效果。

Result: SAPS在解毒、效用保持和效率之间达到最佳平衡，用更少数据获得相当或更好的修复结果；随机采样对大型或鲁棒模型仍然有效；CCS和GraNd等高开销方法收益有限。

Conclusion: 样本选择应被视为修复管道的可调组件，选择式修复是维护LLM可靠性的高效可扩展范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems,
yet they can produce toxic or biased outputs that undermine safety and trust.
Post-hoc model repair provides a practical remedy, but the high cost of
parameter updates motivates selective use of repair data. Despite extensive
prior work on data selection for model training, it remains unclear which
sampling criteria are most effective and efficient when applied specifically to
behavioral repair of large generative models. Our study presents a systematic
analysis of sample prioritization strategies for LLM repair. We evaluate five
representative selection methods, including random sampling, K-Center,
gradient-norm-based selection(GraNd), stratified coverage (CCS), and a
Semantic-Aware Prioritized Sampling (SAPS) approach we proposed. Repair
effectiveness and trade-offs are assessed through toxicity reduction,
perplexity on WikiText-2 and LAMBADA, and three composite metrics: the Repair
Proximity Score (RPS), the Overall Performance Score (OPS), and the Repair
Efficiency Score (RES). Experimental results show that SAPS achieves the best
balance between detoxification, utility preservation, and efficiency,
delivering comparable or superior repair outcomes with substantially less data.
Random sampling remains effective for large or robust models, while
high-overhead methods such as CCS and GraNd provide limited benefit. The
optimal data proportion depends on model scale and repair method, indicating
that sample selection should be regarded as a tunable component of repair
pipelines. Overall, these findings establish selection-based repair as an
efficient and scalable paradigm for maintaining LLM reliability.

Abstract: Evaluating competing systems in a comparable way, i.e., benchmarking them, is
an undeniable pillar of the scientific method. However, system performance is
often summarized via a small number of metrics. The analysis of the evaluation
details and the derivation of insights for further development or use remains a
tedious manual task with often biased results. Thus, this paper argues for a
new type of benchmarking, which is dubbed explainable benchmarking. The aim of
explainable benchmarking approaches is to automatically generate explanations
for the performance of systems in a benchmark. We provide a first instantiation
of this paradigm for knowledge-graph-based question answering systems. We
compute explanations by using a novel concept learning approach developed for
large knowledge graphs called PruneCEL. Our evaluation shows that PruneCEL
outperforms state-of-the-art concept learners on the task of explainable
benchmarking by up to 0.55 points F1 measure. A task-driven user study with 41
participants shows that in 80\% of the cases, the majority of participants can
accurately predict the behavior of a system based on our explanations. Our code

Abstract: Drug combinations offer therapeutic benefits but also carry the risk of
adverse drug-drug interactions (DDIs), especially under complex molecular
structures. Accurate DDI event prediction requires capturing fine-grained
inter-drug relationships, which are critical for modeling metabolic mechanisms
such as enzyme-mediated competition. However, existing approaches typically
rely on isolated drug representations and fail to explicitly model atom-level
cross-molecular interactions, limiting their effectiveness across diverse
molecular complexities and DDI type distributions. To address these
limitations, we propose MolBridge, a novel atom-level joint graph refinement
framework for robust DDI event prediction. MolBridge constructs a joint graph
that integrates atomic structures of drug pairs, enabling direct modeling of
inter-drug associations. A central challenge in such joint graph settings is
the potential loss of information caused by over-smoothing when modeling
long-range atomic dependencies. To overcome this, we introduce a structure
consistency module that iteratively refines node features while preserving the
global structural context. This joint design allows MolBridge to effectively
learn both local and global interaction outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving superior performance across long-tail and inductive scenarios.
patterns, yielding robust representations across both frequent and rare DDI
types. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that MolBridge
consistently. These results demonstrate the advantages of fine-grained graph
refinement in improving the accuracy, robustness, and mechanistic
interpretability of DDI event prediction.This work contributes to Web Mining

Abstract: Intransitive player dominance, where player A beats B, B beats C, but C beats
A, is common in competitive tennis. Yet, there are few known attempts to
incorporate it within forecasting methods. We address this problem with a graph
neural network approach that explicitly models these intransitive relationships
through temporal directed graphs, with players as nodes and their historical
match outcomes as directed edges. We find the bookmaker Pinnacle Sports poorly
handles matches with high intransitive complexity and posit that our
graph-based approach is uniquely positioned to capture relational dynamics in
these scenarios. When selectively betting on higher intransitivity matchups
with our model (65.7% accuracy, 0.215 Brier Score), we achieve significant
positive returns of 3.26% ROI with Kelly staking over 1903 bets, suggesting a
market inefficiency in handling intransitive matchups that our approach

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in interest in digital content watermarking
techniques, driven by the proliferation of generative models and increased
legal pressure. With an ever-growing percentage of AI-generated content
available online, watermarking plays an increasingly important role in ensuring
content authenticity and attribution at scale. There have been many works
assessing the robustness of watermarking to removal attacks, yet, watermark
forging, the scenario when a watermark is stolen from genuine content and
applied to malicious content, remains underexplored. In this work, we
investigate watermark forging in the context of widely used post-hoc image
watermarking. Our contributions are as follows. First, we introduce a
preference model to assess whether an image is watermarked. The model is
trained using a ranking loss on purely procedurally generated images without
any need for real watermarks. Second, we demonstrate the model's capability to
remove and forge watermarks by optimizing the input image through
backpropagation. This technique requires only a single watermarked image and
works without knowledge of the watermarking model, making our attack much
simpler and more practical than attacks introduced in related work. Third, we
evaluate our proposed method on a variety of post-hoc image watermarking
models, demonstrating that our approach can effectively forge watermarks,
questioning the security of current watermarking approaches. Our code and
further resources are publicly available.

Abstract: Exploiting unlabeled data through semi-supervised learning (SSL) or
leveraging pre-trained models via fine-tuning are two prevailing paradigms for
addressing label-scarce scenarios. Recently, growing attention has been given
to combining fine-tuning of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) with SSL,
forming the emerging paradigm of semi-supervised fine-tuning. However, existing
methods often suffer from model bias and hyperparameter sensitivity, due to
reliance on prediction consistency or pre-defined confidence thresholds. To
address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective plug-and-play
methodology named
$\underline{\textbf{Bi-Co}}$nsistency-$\underline{\textbf{G}}$uided
Self-Training (Bi-CoG), which assigns high-quality and low-bias pseudo-labels,
by simultaneously exploiting inter-model and intra-model consistency, along
with an error-aware dynamic pseudo-label assignment strategy. Both theoretical
analysis and extensive experiments over 14 datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of Bi-CoG, which consistently and significantly improves the
performance of existing methods.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced quantitative remote sensing, yet its
effectiveness is constrained by imbalanced label distribution. This imbalance
leads conventionally trained models to favor common samples, which in turn
degrades retrieval performance for rare ones. Rainfall retrieval exemplifies
this issue, with performance particularly compromised for heavy rain. This
study proposes Hurdle-Inversion Model Debiasing Learning (IMDL) framework.
Following a divide-and-conquer strategy, imbalance in the rain distribution is
decomposed into two components: zero inflation, defined by the predominance of
non-rain samples; and long tail, defined by the disproportionate abundance of
light-rain samples relative to heavy-rain samples. A hurdle model is adopted to
handle the zero inflation, while IMDL is proposed to address the long tail by
transforming the learning object into an unbiased ideal inverse model.
Comprehensive evaluation via statistical metrics and case studies investigating
rainy weather in eastern China confirms Hurdle-IMDL's superiority over
conventional, cost-sensitive, generative, and multi-task learning methods. Its
key advancements include effective mitigation of systematic underestimation and
a marked improvement in the retrieval of heavy-to-extreme rain. IMDL offers a
generalizable approach for addressing imbalance in distributions of
environmental variables, enabling enhanced retrieval of rare yet high-impact
events.

*Abdulmomen Ghalkha,Zhuojun Tian,Chaouki Ben Issaid,Mehdi Bennis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SheafAlign是一个基于层论的分散式多模态对齐框架，通过多比较空间替代单空间对齐，解决了传统方法需要所有模态相互冗余的假设问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态对齐方法假设所有模态之间相互冗余，这在现实分布式场景中不成立。需要一种能够处理非冗余模态关系的对齐方法。

Method: 使用层结构建模成对模态关系，采用分散式对比学习目标进行训练，在多比较空间中进行对齐。

Result: 在多模态感知数据集上表现出优异的零样本泛化能力、跨模态对齐性能和缺失模态鲁棒性，通信成本比最先进基线降低50%。

Conclusion: SheafAlign通过层论框架成功解决了传统多模态对齐的局限性，能够保留共享和独特信息，在分布式场景中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Conventional multimodal alignment methods assume mutual redundancy across all
modalities, an assumption that fails in real-world distributed scenarios. We
propose SheafAlign, a sheaf-theoretic framework for decentralized multimodal
alignment that replaces single-space alignment with multiple comparison spaces.
This approach models pairwise modality relations through sheaf structures and
leverages decentralized contrastive learning-based objectives for training.
SheafAlign overcomes the limitations of prior methods by not requiring mutual
redundancy among all modalities, preserving both shared and unique information.
Experiments on multimodal sensing datasets show superior zero-shot
generalization, cross-modal alignment, and robustness to missing modalities,
with 50\% lower communication cost than state-of-the-art baselines.

Result: 框架能够组织现有方法并直接比较，为后继特征方法推导了扩展边界，提供了对其在零样本机制中性能的新视角。

Conclusion: 该统一框架为零样本强化学习提供了原则性基础，为开发更通用智能体指明了清晰路径。

Abstract: Zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a setting for developing
general agents in an unsupervised manner, capable of solving downstream tasks
without additional training or planning at test-time. Unlike conventional RL,
which optimizes policies for a fixed reward, zero-shot RL requires agents to
encode representations rich enough to support immediate adaptation to any
objective, drawing parallels to vision and language foundation models. Despite
growing interest, the field lacks a common analytical lens.
  We present the first unified framework for zero-shot RL. Our formulation
introduces a consistent notation and taxonomy that organizes existing
approaches and allows direct comparison between them. Central to our framework
is the classification of algorithms into two families: direct representations,
which learn end-to-end mappings from rewards to policies, and compositional
representations, which decompose the representation leveraging the substructure
of the value function. Within this framework, we highlight shared principles
and key differences across methods, and we derive an extended bound for
successor-feature methods, offering a new perspective on their performance in
the zero-shot regime. By consolidating existing work under a common lens, our
framework provides a principled foundation for future research in zero-shot RL
and outlines a clear path toward developing more general agents.

<details>

Motivation: 图重布线技术虽能缓解GNN中的过压缩问题，但会改变图拓扑结构，可能扭曲重要的拓扑依赖信号。目前尚不清楚需要保留哪些结构属性才能确保性能提升和结构保真度。

Method: 研究了七种不同的重布线策略，并将局部和全局图属性的变化与节点分类准确性相关联进行系统分析。

Result: 结果显示成功的重布线方法倾向于保留局部结构，同时允许全局连接的灵活性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为设计有效的重布线策略提供了新见解，弥合了图论与实用GNN优化之间的差距。

Abstract: Graph rewiring has emerged as a key technique to alleviate over-squashing in
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Transformers by modifying the graph
topology to improve information flow. While effective, rewiring inherently
alters the graph's structure, raising the risk of distorting important
topology-dependent signals. Yet, despite the growing use of rewiring, little is
known about which structural properties must be preserved to ensure both
performance gains and structural fidelity. In this work, we provide the first
systematic analysis of how rewiring affects a range of graph structural
metrics, and how these changes relate to downstream task performance. We study
seven diverse rewiring strategies and correlate changes in local and global
graph properties with node classification accuracy. Our results reveal a
consistent pattern: successful rewiring methods tend to preserve local
structure while allowing for flexibility in global connectivity. These findings
offer new insights into the design of effective rewiring strategies, bridging
the gap between graph theory and practical GNN optimization.

Method: 评估RAMI 4.0和ISA-95标准对MLOps集成的适用性，将MLOps生命周期组件映射到RAMI 4.0架构，并通过实际用例进行验证。

Result: 研究发现标准MLOps实践不能直接应用于OT环境，但通过使用现有参考模型进行结构化适配，可以提供成功的集成路径。

Conclusion: 基于现有参考模型的系统化方法能够有效解决MLOps与OT环境集成的挑战，为工业实践提供可行的集成方案。

Abstract: Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) practices are increas- ingly adopted in
industrial settings, yet their integration with Opera- tional Technology (OT)
systems presents significant challenges. This pa- per analyzes the fundamental
obstacles in combining MLOps with OT en- vironments and proposes a systematic
approach to embed MLOps prac- tices into established OT reference models. We
evaluate the suitability of the Reference Architectural Model for Industry 4.0

MLOps integration and present a detailed mapping of MLOps lifecycle compo-
nents to RAMI 4.0 exemplified by a real-world use case. Our findings
demonstrate that while standard MLOps practices cannot be directly transplanted
to OT environments, structured adaptation using existing reference models can
provide a pathway for successful integration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端推理模型在训练分布之外的泛化能力有限，无法有效解决比训练样本更复杂的问题。

Method: 学习子问题的能量景观，在测试时组合多个子问题的能量函数构建全局能量景观，并引入并行能量最小化(PEM)来提升采样质量。

Result: 在多种推理问题上超越现有最先进方法，能够泛化到更大更复杂的问题。

Conclusion: 通过组合子问题能量函数的方法有效提升了推理模型的泛化能力，为复杂推理任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Generalization is a key challenge in machine learning, specifically in
reasoning tasks, where models are expected to solve problems more complex than
those encountered during training. Existing approaches typically train
reasoning models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping input instances to
solutions. While this allows models to learn useful heuristics from data, it
often results in limited generalization beyond the training distribution. In
this work, we propose a novel approach to reasoning generalization by learning
energy landscapes over the solution spaces of smaller, more tractable
subproblems. At test time, we construct a global energy landscape for a given
problem by combining the energy functions of multiple subproblems. This
compositional approach enables the incorporation of additional constraints
during inference, allowing the construction of energy landscapes for problems
of increasing difficulty. To improve the sample quality from this newly
constructed energy landscape, we introduce Parallel Energy Minimization (PEM).
We evaluate our approach on a wide set of reasoning problems. Our method
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its ability to
generalize to larger and more complex problems. Project website can be found

TL;DR: 本文对随机梯度下降(SGD)在期望平滑性(ES)条件下的收敛性进行了系统分析，改进了ES条件的解释，推导了全梯度范数的期望界，并证明了不同步长策略下的O(1/K)收敛速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典SGD分析依赖于过强(有界方差)或过粗糙(均匀噪声)的假设，期望平滑性条件作为灵活替代方案，将随机梯度的二阶矩与目标函数值和全梯度联系起来。

Method: 通过精炼ES条件及其解释，引入采样相关常数，推导全梯度范数平方的期望界，分析不同步长策略下的收敛性。

Result: 证明了SGD在ES条件下具有O(1/K)的收敛速率，并给出了明确的残差误差表达式。

Conclusion: 该分析统一并扩展了近期相关工作，为SGD在期望平滑性条件下的收敛性提供了完整的理论框架。

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is the workhorse of large-scale learning,
yet classical analyses rely on assumptions that can be either too strong
(bounded variance) or too coarse (uniform noise). The expected smoothness (ES)
condition has emerged as a flexible alternative that ties the second moment of
stochastic gradients to the objective value and the full gradient. This paper
presents a self-contained convergence analysis of SGD under ES. We (i) refine
ES with interpretations and sampling-dependent constants; (ii) derive bounds of
the expectation of squared full gradient norm; and (iii) prove $O(1/K)$ rates
with explicit residual errors for various step-size schedules. All proofs are
given in full detail in the appendix. Our treatment unifies and extends recent
threads (Khaled and Richt\'arik, 2020; Umeda and Iiduka, 2025).

Abstract: Breast cancer is considered the most critical and frequently diagnosed cancer
in women worldwide, leading to an increase in cancer-related mortality. Early
and accurate detection is crucial as it can help mitigate possible threats
while improving survival rates. In terms of prediction, conventional diagnostic
methods are often limited by variability, cost, and, most importantly, risk of
misdiagnosis. To address these challenges, machine learning (ML) has emerged as
a powerful tool for computer-aided diagnosis, with feature selection playing a
vital role in improving model performance and interpretability. This research
study proposes an integrated framework that incorporates customized Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) for feature selection. This framework has been
evaluated on a comprehensive set of 29 different models, spanning classical
classifiers, ensemble techniques, neural networks, probabilistic algorithms,
and instance-based algorithms. To ensure interpretability and clinical
relevance, the study uses cross-validation in conjunction with explainable AI
methods. Experimental evaluation showed that the proposed approach achieved a
superior score of 99.1\% across all performance metrics, including accuracy and
precision, while effectively reducing dimensionality and providing transparent,
model-agnostic explanations. The results highlight the potential of combining
swarm intelligence with explainable ML for robust, trustworthy, and clinically
meaningful breast cancer diagnosis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BadGraph是针对文本引导图生成的潜在扩散模型的隐蔽后门攻击方法，使用文本触发器植入后门，在推理时生成攻击者指定的子图，同时保持对干净输入的正常性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图生成技术的快速发展，后门漏洞等安全问题日益突出。现有研究主要关注图像扩散和无条件图生成的后门攻击，而文本引导的图生成领域尚未得到充分研究。

Method: BadGraph利用文本触发器污染训练数据，在潜在扩散模型中秘密植入后门。当推理时出现触发器时，模型会生成攻击者指定的子图，但对干净输入仍保持正常性能。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，攻击效果显著且隐蔽：不到10%的中毒率即可达到50%攻击成功率，24%的中毒率可实现超过80%的成功率，且对良性样本的性能影响可忽略不计。消融研究显示后门是在VAE和扩散训练阶段植入的。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了文本引导图生成的潜在扩散模型中的安全漏洞，强调了在药物发现等应用中的严重风险，并凸显了对此类扩散模型进行后门攻击防御的必要性。

Abstract: The rapid progress of graph generation has raised new security concerns,
particularly regarding backdoor vulnerabilities. While prior work has explored
backdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation,
conditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely
unexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method targeting
latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages
textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that
induce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear,
while preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the
effectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can
achieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate,
with negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies
further reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training
rather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in
latent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious
risks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need
for robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MS-BART是一个统一建模框架，通过大规模预训练将质谱和分子结构映射到共享词汇表中，实现跨模态学习，在分子识别任务中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质谱在分子识别中至关重要，但由于标注谱图稀缺，从质谱数据中解析结构仍然具有挑战性。现有的大规模预训练方法难以直接应用于质谱数据，因为原始谱信号复杂且异质性强。

Method: 提出MS-BART框架：1）将质谱和分子结构映射到共享词汇表；2）通过大规模预训练在指纹-分子数据集上学习；3）多任务预训练目标联合优化去噪和翻译任务；4）使用MIST模型生成指纹预测进行微调；5）引入化学反馈机制减少分子幻觉。

Result: 在MassSpecGym和NPLIB1基准测试中，MS-BART在5/12个关键指标上达到SOTA性能，比基于扩散的竞争方法快一个数量级。消融研究系统验证了模型的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MS-BART通过统一建模框架和跨模态预训练，有效解决了质谱数据稀缺和异质性问题，在分子结构解析任务中表现出色，为质谱分析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Mass spectrometry (MS) plays a critical role in molecular identification,
significantly advancing scientific discovery. However, structure elucidation
from MS data remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated spectra.
While large-scale pretraining has proven effective in addressing data scarcity
in other domains, applying this paradigm to mass spectrometry is hindered by
the complexity and heterogeneity of raw spectral signals. To address this, we
propose MS-BART, a unified modeling framework that maps mass spectra and
molecular structures into a shared token vocabulary, enabling cross-modal
learning through large-scale pretraining on reliably computed
fingerprint-molecule datasets. Multi-task pretraining objectives further
enhance MS-BART's generalization by jointly optimizing denoising and
translation task. The pretrained model is subsequently transferred to
experimental spectra through finetuning on fingerprint predictions generated
with MIST, a pre-trained spectral inference model, thereby enhancing robustness
to real-world spectral variability. While finetuning alleviates the
distributional difference, MS-BART still suffers molecular hallucination and
requires further alignment. We therefore introduce a chemical feedback
mechanism that guides the model toward generating molecules closer to the
reference structure. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MS-BART achieves
SOTA performance across 5/12 key metrics on MassSpecGym and NPLIB1 and is
faster by one order of magnitude than competing diffusion-based methods, while
comprehensive ablation studies systematically validate the model's
effectiveness and robustness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种快速无微调的LLM适配方法，通过选择性矩阵降维和梯度分析，仅需100个样本和单次梯度计算即可实现下游任务适配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LASER方法虽然能通过剪枝提升下游任务准确率，但其逐层搜索和全数据集前向传播的开销使其难以快速部署。本文旨在消除这种开销。

Method: 使用梯度分析识别关键矩阵，允许矩阵行在多子空间聚类并分别分解，仅需100个样本计算梯度和评估准确率。

Result: 方法将准确率提升达24.6个百分点，显著减少搜索时间，实现快速稳健的下游任务适配。

Conclusion: 结合梯度分析和选择性降维，可在无微调情况下快速适配LLM到新数据集，仅需少量计算资源。

Abstract: Recently, Sharma et al. suggested a method called Layer-SElective-Rank
reduction (LASER) which demonstrated that pruning high-order components of
carefully chosen LLM's weight matrices can boost downstream accuracy -- without
any gradient-based fine-tuning. Yet LASER's exhaustive, per-matrix search (each
requiring full-dataset forward passes) makes it impractical for rapid
deployment. We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i)
Only a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected --
eliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's
singular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the
factorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple
subspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces
overfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to
24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just
100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the
indicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to
further reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream
tasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show
that combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for
downstream tasks. Overall, with a single gradient step on 100 examples and a
quick scan of the top candidate layers and factorization techniques, we can
adapt LLMs to new datasets -- entirely without fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 本文分析了差分隐私迁移学习中的两个关键超参数：裁剪边界C和批次大小B，揭示了理论选择与实证结果之间的不匹配，并指出现有启发式方法在有限计算预算下的失效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前差分隐私迁移学习实践中，裁剪边界C和批次大小B的选择存在理论与实证的脱节，特别是在强隐私约束下，现有启发式方法效果不佳，需要更深入的分析来指导超参数选择。

Method: 通过分析梯度分布变化，研究在有限计算预算下裁剪边界C和批次大小B对性能的影响，将裁剪视为梯度重加权形式，并考察累积DP噪声的作用。

Result: 发现强隐私约束下使用较大C反而表现更好，与理论预期相反；在固定epochs下，现有批次大小调优启发式方法失效，累积DP噪声能更好解释批次大小选择；跨任务使用单一(C,B)设置会导致次优性能。

Conclusion: 需要重新思考差分隐私迁移学习中的超参数选择策略，特别是在强隐私和有限计算约束下，应考虑梯度分布变化和累积DP噪声的影响，避免跨任务使用固定参数设置。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) transfer learning, i.e., fine-tuning a pretrained
model on private data, is the current state-of-the-art approach for training
large models under privacy constraints. We focus on two key hyperparameters in
this setting: the clipping bound $C$ and batch size $B$. We show a clear
mismatch between the current theoretical understanding of how to choose an
optimal $C$ (stronger privacy requires smaller $C$) and empirical outcomes
(larger $C$ performs better under strong privacy), caused by changes in the
gradient distributions. Assuming a limited compute budget (fixed epochs), we
demonstrate that the existing heuristics for tuning $B$ do not work, while
cumulative DP noise better explains whether smaller or larger batches perform
better. We also highlight how the common practice of using a single $(C,B)$
setting across tasks can lead to suboptimal performance. We find that
performance drops especially when moving between loose and tight privacy and
between plentiful and limited compute, which we explain by analyzing clipping
as a form of gradient re-weighting and examining cumulative DP noise.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决特征学习中显著特征提取的问题，通过显式分解显著和非显著特征来促进学习任务相关的低维特征表示。

Method: 提出H-SPLID算法，将显著和非显著特征分解到不同的空间，利用Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC)来建立输入扰动下的预测偏差与显著子空间维度之间的联系。

Result: 在图像分类任务上的实证评估表明，使用H-SPLID训练的模型主要依赖显著输入组件，对影响非显著特征（如图像背景）的扰动表现出较低的敏感性。

Conclusion: H-SPLID成功建立了鲁棒性与潜在表示压缩之间的联系，能够有效学习任务相关的显著特征表示，提高模型对非显著特征扰动的鲁棒性。

Abstract: We introduce H-SPLID, a novel algorithm for learning salient feature
representations through the explicit decomposition of salient and non-salient
features into separate spaces. We show that H-SPLID promotes learning
low-dimensional, task-relevant features. We prove that the expected prediction
deviation under input perturbations is upper-bounded by the dimension of the
salient subspace and the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) between
inputs and representations. This establishes a link between robustness and
latent representation compression in terms of the dimensionality and
information preserved. Empirical evaluations on image classification tasks show
that models trained with H-SPLID primarily rely on salient input components, as
indicated by reduced sensitivity to perturbations affecting non-salient
features, such as image backgrounds. Our code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在医疗领域的应用中，临床数据中的结构性不平等和社会偏见可能被数据驱动模型延续甚至放大。生存分析中的删失和时间动态进一步增加了公平模型开发的复杂性，且现有方法常忽视跨组排名差异问题。

Method: 提出了公平感知生存建模方法，专门设计用于减轻算法偏见，关注组内和跨组风险排名随时间的变化。以乳腺癌预后为代表性案例，应用于SEER乳腺癌数据。

Result: FASM显著提高了公平性，同时保持了与不考虑公平性的生存模型相当的判别性能。时间分层评估显示FASM在10年时间范围内保持稳定的公平性，在随访中期观察到最大改进。

Conclusion: 该方法使得生存模型能够在临床决策中同时优先考虑准确性和公平性，将公平性作为临床护理的核心原则向前推进。

Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly integrated into healthcare,
structural inequities and social biases embedded in clinical data can be
perpetuated or even amplified by data-driven models. In survival analysis,
censoring and time dynamics can further add complexity to fair model
development. Additionally, algorithmic fairness approaches often overlook
disparities in cross-group rankings, e.g., high-risk Black patients may be
ranked below lower-risk White patients who do not experience the event of
mortality. Such misranking can reinforce biological essentialism and undermine
equitable care. We propose a Fairness-Aware Survival Modeling (FASM), designed
to mitigate algorithmic bias regarding both intra-group and cross-group risk
rankings over time. Using breast cancer prognosis as a representative case and
applying FASM to SEER breast cancer data, we show that FASM substantially
improves fairness while preserving discrimination performance comparable to
fairness-unaware survival models. Time-stratified evaluations show that FASM
maintains stable fairness over a 10-year horizon, with the greatest
improvements observed during the mid-term of follow-up. Our approach enables
the development of survival models that prioritize both accuracy and equity in
clinical decision-making, advancing fairness as a core principle in clinical
care.

prompt/fine-tuning strategies for wireless tasks. We demonstrate the framework
through three case studies: LMM-based traffic control, LLM-based robot
scheduling, and LMM-based environment-aware channel estimation. From
experimental results, we show that the proposed LLM/LMM-aided autonomous
systems significantly outperform conventional and discriminative deep learning
(DL) model-based techniques, maintaining robustness under dynamic objectives,
varying input parameters, and heterogeneous multimodal conditions where
conventional static optimization degrades.

Abstract: In this paper, we present DiRecGNN, an attention-enhanced entity
recommendation framework for monitoring cloud services at Microsoft. We provide
insights on the usefulness of this feature as perceived by the cloud service
owners and lessons learned from deployment. Specifically, we introduce the
problem of recommending the optimal subset of attributes (dimensions) that
should be tracked by an automated watchdog (monitor) for cloud services. To
begin, we construct the monitor heterogeneous graph at production-scale. The
interaction dynamics of these entities are often characterized by limited
structural and engagement information, resulting in inferior performance of
state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, traditional methods fail to capture the
dependencies between entities spanning a long range due to their homophilic
nature. Therefore, we propose an attention-enhanced entity ranking model
inspired by transformer architectures. Our model utilizes a multi-head
attention mechanism to focus on heterogeneous neighbors and their attributes,
and further attends to paths sampled using random walks to capture long-range
dependencies. We also employ multi-faceted loss functions to optimize for
relevant recommendations while respecting the inherent sparsity of the data.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over existing
methods, with our model achieving a 43.1% increase in MRR. Furthermore, product
teams who consumed these features perceive the feature as useful and rated it
4.5 out of 5.

TL;DR: 本文推导了一个新的、紧致的、可处理的KLD下界作为JSD的函数，证明了最大化JSD基础的信息测量能够增加互信息的保证下界，为基于互信息的表示学习提供了新的理论依据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互信息是表示学习中的基本统计依赖度量，但直接优化往往难以处理。许多方法转而最大化替代依赖度量（如Jensen-Shannon散度），但这些替代目标与互信息的关系理解不足。

Method: 推导KLD作为JSD函数的紧致下界，通过二元分类器的交叉熵损失最小化实现JSD基础目标，并与最先进的神经估计器进行比较。

Result: 实验表明该下界在互信息估计中是紧致的，相比现有方法提供了稳定、低方差的紧致下界估计，在信息瓶颈框架中具有实际应用价值。

Conclusion: 研究结果为在基于互信息的表示学习中使用判别式学习提供了新的理论依据和强有力的实证证据。

Abstract: Mutual Information (MI) is a fundamental measure of statistical dependence
widely used in representation learning. While direct optimization of MI via its
definition as a Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) is often intractable, many
recent methods have instead maximized alternative dependence measures, most
notably, the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between joint and product of
marginal distributions via discriminative losses. However, the connection
between these surrogate objectives and MI remains poorly understood. In this
work, we bridge this gap by deriving a new, tight, and tractable lower bound on
KLD as a function of JSD in the general case. By specializing this bound to
joint and marginal distributions, we demonstrate that maximizing the JSD-based
information increases a guaranteed lower bound on mutual information.
Furthermore, we revisit the practical implementation of JSD-based objectives
and observe that minimizing the cross-entropy loss of a binary classifier
trained to distinguish joint from marginal pairs recovers a known variational
lower bound on the JSD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our lower bound
is tight when applied to MI estimation. We compared our lower bound to
state-of-the-art neural estimators of variational lower bound across a range of
established reference scenarios. Our lower bound estimator consistently
provides a stable, low-variance estimate of a tight lower bound on MI. We also
demonstrate its practical usefulness in the context of the Information
Bottleneck framework. Taken together, our results provide new theoretical
justifications and strong empirical evidence for using discriminative learning
in MI-based representation learning.

TL;DR: xTime是一个用于时间序列极端事件预测的新框架，通过知识蒸馏和专家混合机制提升对罕见极端事件的预测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界时间序列中的极端事件（如洪水、热浪、医疗急症）具有重要实际意义，但现有模型往往因数据不平衡和忽略中间事件信息而难以准确预测极端事件

Method: 提出xTime框架：1）利用知识蒸馏从训练在较低稀有度事件上的模型转移信息；2）引入专家混合机制动态选择和融合不同稀有度级别的专家模型输出

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，xTime实现了持续改进，极端事件的预测准确率从3%提升到78%

Conclusion: xTime通过知识蒸馏和专家混合机制有效解决了极端事件预测中的数据不平衡问题，显著提升了预测性能

Abstract: Extreme events frequently occur in real-world time series and often carry
significant practical implications. In domains such as climate and healthcare,
these events, such as floods, heatwaves, or acute medical episodes, can lead to
serious consequences. Accurate forecasting of such events is therefore of
substantial importance. Most existing time series forecasting models are
optimized for overall performance within the prediction window, but often
struggle to accurately predict extreme events, such as high temperatures or
heart rate spikes. The main challenges are data imbalance and the neglect of
valuable information contained in intermediate events that precede extreme
events. In this paper, we propose xTime, a novel framework for extreme event
forecasting in time series. xTime leverages knowledge distillation to transfer
information from models trained on lower-rarity events, thereby improving
prediction performance on rarer ones. In addition, we introduce a mixture of
experts (MoE) mechanism that dynamically selects and fuses outputs from expert
models across different rarity levels, which further improves the forecasting
performance for extreme events. Experiments on multiple datasets show that
xTime achieves consistent improvements, with forecasting accuracy on extreme
events improving from 3% to 78%.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合贝叶斯专家混合框架，融合物理路径损耗模型和卷积神经网络，用于GNSS干扰源定位和接收信号强度场重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNSS信号在城市环境中容易受到干扰，现有数据驱动方法定位精度尚可但信号强度场重建效果差，因为缺乏空间上下文信息。

Method: 使用对数线性池化融合物理路径损耗模型和CNN，PL专家保证物理一致性，CNN利用建筑高度图捕捉城市传播效应，采用拉普拉斯近似的贝叶斯推理。

Result: 在城市射线追踪数据上的实验表明，随着训练点增加，定位精度提高且不确定性降低，不确定性集中在干扰源附近和城市峡谷等传播敏感区域。

Conclusion: 该混合框架能够有效定位GNSS干扰源并重建RSS场，同时提供位置和信号强度场的后验不确定性估计。

Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are vulnerable to jamming,
particularly in urban areas where multipath and shadowing distort received
power. Previous data-driven approaches achieved reasonable localization but
poorly reconstructed the received signal strength (RSS) field due to limited
spatial context. We propose a hybrid Bayesian mixture-of-experts framework that
fuses a physical path-loss (PL) model and a convolutional neural network (CNN)
through log-linear pooling. The PL expert ensures physical consistency, while
the CNN leverages building-height maps to capture urban propagation effects.
Bayesian inference with Laplace approximation provides posterior uncertainty
over both the jammer position and RSS field. Experiments on urban ray-tracing
data show that localization accuracy improves and uncertainty decreases with
more training points, while uncertainty concentrates near the jammer and along
urban canyons where propagation is most sensitive.

Conclusion: 通过聚焦于生成核心、交互循环和记忆系统这三个关键要素，为构建真正的世界模型提供了最有前景的发展方向。

Abstract: This is not a typical survey of world models; it is a guide for those who
want to build worlds. We do not aim to catalog every paper that has ever
mentioned a ``world model". Instead, we follow one clear road: from early
masked models that unified representation learning across modalities, to
unified architectures that share a single paradigm, then to interactive
generative models that close the action-perception loop, and finally to
memory-augmented systems that sustain consistent worlds over time. We bypass
loosely related branches to focus on the core: the generative heart, the
interactive loop, and the memory system. We show that this is the most
promising path towards true world models.

Conclusion: GRACE框架能有效解决成瘾患者护理场所预测中的类别不平衡问题，为自动化决策支持提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Determining the appropriate locus of care for addiction patients is one of
the most critical clinical decisions that affects patient treatment outcomes
and effective use of resources. With a lack of sufficient specialized treatment
resources, such as inpatient beds or staff, there is an unmet need to develop
an automated framework for the same. Current decision-making approaches suffer
from severe class imbalances in addiction datasets. To address this limitation,
we propose a novel graph neural network (GRACE) framework that formalizes locus
of care prediction as a structured learning problem. Further, we perform
extensive feature engineering and propose a new approach of obtaining an
unbiased meta-graph to train a GNN to overcome the class imbalance problem.
Experimental results in real-world data show an improvement of 11-35% in terms
of the F1 score of the minority class over competitive baselines. The codes and

Motivation: 灵长类或人类等生物数据稀缺，高吞吐量记录技术难以应用，这对深度学习解码技术构成挑战。

Method: 结合神经元特异性MEIs、结构相似性指数损失和对抗训练的生物信息解码方法。

Result: 在V1单细胞活动重建视觉刺激方面达到SOTA性能，尤其在小数据集上表现优异，仅需1,000-2,500个神经元和少于1,000个训练数据点即可重建高保真自然图像。

Conclusion: 证明了在早期视觉系统中可靠解码的可行性，为神经科学和神经工程应用提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Decoding visual stimuli from neural population activity is crucial for
understanding the brain and for applications in brain-machine interfaces.
However, such biological data is often scarce, particularly in primates or
humans, where high-throughput recording techniques, such as two-photon imaging,
remain challenging or impossible to apply. This, in turn, poses a challenge for
deep learning decoding techniques. To overcome this, we introduce MEIcoder, a
biologically informed decoding method that leverages neuron-specific most
exciting inputs (MEIs), a structural similarity index measure loss, and
adversarial training. MEIcoder achieves state-of-the-art performance in
reconstructing visual stimuli from single-cell activity in primary visual
cortex (V1), especially excelling on small datasets with fewer recorded
neurons. Using ablation studies, we demonstrate that MEIs are the main drivers
of the performance, and in scaling experiments, we show that MEIcoder can
reconstruct high-fidelity natural-looking images from as few as 1,000-2,500
neurons and less than 1,000 training data points. We also propose a unified
benchmark with over 160,000 samples to foster future research. Our results
demonstrate the feasibility of reliable decoding in early visual system and
provide practical insights for neuroscience and neuroengineering applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于学习的神经解码方法存在两个问题：简单的因果模型缺乏泛化能力，复杂的非因果模型虽然能泛化但难以实时应用。两者都依赖高能耗的人工神经网络，难以集成到资源受限的真实系统中。

Method: 提出Spikachu框架，直接处理分箱的脉冲信号，将其投影到共享潜在空间中，通过适应输入时序的脉冲模块提取相关特征，然后整合这些潜在表示并解码生成行为预测。

Result: 在6只非人类灵长类动物的113个记录会话（总计43小时记录）上评估，该方法在单会话训练中优于因果基线，能耗降低2.26-418.81倍。多会话和跨主体训练能进一步提升性能，并实现对新会话、主体和任务的少样本迁移。

Conclusion: Spikachu提供了一个基于SNN的可扩展、在线兼容的神经解码框架，其性能与最先进模型相当，同时能耗显著降低。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) promise to enable vital functions, such as
speech and prosthetic control, for individuals with neuromotor impairments.
Central to their success are neural decoders, models that map neural activity
to intended behavior. Current learning-based decoding approaches fall into two
classes: simple, causal models that lack generalization, or complex, non-causal
models that generalize and scale offline but struggle in real-time settings.
Both face a common challenge, their reliance on power-hungry artificial neural
network backbones, which makes integration into real-world, resource-limited
systems difficult. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising
alternative. Because they operate causally these models are suitable for
real-time use, and their low energy demands make them ideal for
battery-constrained environments. To this end, we introduce Spikachu: a
scalable, causal, and energy-efficient neural decoding framework based on SNNs.
Our approach processes binned spikes directly by projecting them into a shared
latent space, where spiking modules, adapted to the timing of the input,
extract relevant features; these latent representations are then integrated and
decoded to generate behavioral predictions. We evaluate our approach on 113
recording sessions from 6 non-human primates, totaling 43 hours of recordings.
Our method outperforms causal baselines when trained on single sessions using
between 2.26 and 418.81 times less energy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
scaling up training to multiple sessions and subjects improves performance and
enables few-shot transfer to unseen sessions, subjects, and tasks. Overall,
Spikachu introduces a scalable, online-compatible neural decoding framework
based on SNNs, whose performance is competitive relative to state-of-the-art
models while consuming orders of magnitude less energy.

Abstract: The ability to continually learn, retain and deploy skills to accomplish
goals is a key feature of intelligent and efficient behavior. However, the
neural mechanisms facilitating the continual learning and flexible
(re-)composition of skills remain elusive. Here, we study continual learning
and the compositional reuse of learned computations in recurrent neural network
(RNN) models using a novel two-system approach: one system that infers what
computation to perform, and one that implements how to perform it. We focus on
a set of compositional cognitive tasks commonly studied in neuroscience. To
construct the what system, we first show that a large family of tasks can be
systematically described by a probabilistic generative model, where
compositionality stems from a shared underlying vocabulary of discrete task
epochs. The shared epoch structure makes these tasks inherently compositional.
We first show that this compositionality can be systematically described by a
probabilistic generative model. Furthermore, We develop an unsupervised online
learning approach that can learn this model on a single-trial basis, building
its vocabulary incrementally as it is exposed to new tasks, and inferring the
latent epoch structure as a time-varying computational context within a trial.
We implement the how system as an RNN whose low-rank components are composed
according to the context inferred by the what system. Contextual inference
facilitates the creation, learning, and reuse of low-rank RNN components as new
tasks are introduced sequentially, enabling continual learning without
catastrophic forgetting. Using an example task set, we demonstrate the efficacy
and competitive performance of this two-system learning framework, its
potential for forward and backward transfer, as well as fast compositional
generalization to unseen tasks.

Motivation: 旨在通过数据驱动方法更好地将JHFRAT跌倒风险预测与临床有意义的指标对齐，改进住院患者跌倒预防协议和患者安全。

Method: 对54,209例住院患者进行回顾性分析，使用约束评分优化(CSO)模型结合JHFRAT评估数据和电子健康记录变量，并与基准黑盒模型(XGBoost)进行比较。

Result: CSO模型预测性能显著优于当前JHFRAT(AUC-ROC=0.91 vs 0.86)，在有无EHR变量时表现相似，虽然XGBoost性能更好(AUC-ROC=0.94)，但CSO对风险标签变化更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这种循证方法为医疗系统使用数据驱动优化技术系统性增强住院患者跌倒预防协议和患者安全提供了坚实基础，有助于改善风险评估和医疗资源配置。

Abstract: In this study we aim to better align fall risk prediction from the Johns
Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (JHFRAT) with additional clinically
meaningful measures via a data-driven modelling approach. We conducted a
retrospective analysis of 54,209 inpatient admissions from three Johns Hopkins
Health System hospitals between March 2022 and October 2023. A total of 20,208
admissions were included as high fall risk encounters, and 13,941 were included
as low fall risk encounters. To incorporate clinical knowledge and maintain
interpretability, we employed constrained score optimization (CSO) models on
JHFRAT assessment data and additional electronic health record (EHR) variables.
The model demonstrated significant improvements in predictive performance over
the current JHFRAT (CSO AUC-ROC=0.91, JHFRAT AUC-ROC=0.86). The constrained
score optimization models performed similarly with and without the EHR
variables. Although the benchmark black-box model (XGBoost), improves upon the
performance metrics of the knowledge-based constrained logistic regression
(AUC-ROC=0.94), the CSO demonstrates more robustness to variations in risk
labelling. This evidence-based approach provides a robust foundation for health
systems to systematically enhance inpatient fall prevention protocols and
patient safety using data-driven optimization techniques, contributing to
improved risk assessment and resource allocation in healthcare settings.

Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex and precision-driven
process, characterized by thousands of interdependent parameters collected
across diverse tools and process steps. Multi-variate time-series analysis has
emerged as a critical field for real-time monitoring and fault detection in
such environments. However, anomaly prediction in semiconductor fabrication
presents several critical challenges, including high dimensionality of sensor
data and severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults. Furthermore,
the complex interdependencies between variables complicate both anomaly
prediction and root-cause-analysis. This paper proposes two novel approaches to
advance the field from anomaly detection to anomaly prediction, an essential
step toward enabling real-time process correction and proactive fault
prevention. The proposed anomaly prediction framework contains two main stages:
(a) training a forecasting model on a dataset assumed to contain no anomalies,
and (b) performing forecast on unseen time series data. The forecast is
compared with the forecast of the trained signal. Deviations beyond a
predefined threshold are flagged as anomalies. The two approaches differ in the
forecasting model employed. The first assumes independence between variables by
utilizing the N-BEATS model for univariate time series forecasting. The second
lifts this assumption by utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture
inter-variable relationships. Both models demonstrate strong forecasting
performance up to a horizon of 20 time points and maintain stable anomaly
prediction up to 50 time points. The GNN consistently outperforms the N-BEATS
model while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters and lower
computational cost. These results position the GNN as promising solution for
online anomaly forecasting to be deployed in manufacturing environments.

Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) is a powerful and widely used strategy for sequential
decision-making, with applications ranging from Bayesian optimization to
reinforcement learning (RL). Despite its success, the theoretical foundations
of TS remain limited, particularly in settings with complex temporal structure
such as RL. We address this gap by establishing no-regret guarantees for TS
using models with Gaussian marginal distributions. Specifically, we consider TS
in episodic RL with joint Gaussian process (GP) priors over rewards and
transitions. We prove a regret bound of
$\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\sqrt{KH\Gamma(KH)})$ over $K$ episodes of horizon $H$,
where $\Gamma(\cdot)$ captures the complexity of the GP model. Our analysis
addresses several challenges, including the non-Gaussian nature of value
functions and the recursive structure of Bellman updates, and extends classical
tools such as the elliptical potential lemma to multi-output settings. This
work advances the understanding of TS in RL and highlights how structural
assumptions and model uncertainty shape its performance in finite-horizon
Markov Decision Processes.

Abstract: Natural language has long enabled human cooperation, but its lossy,
ambiguous, and indirect nature limits the potential of collective intelligence.
While machines are not subject to these constraints, most LLM-based multi-agent
systems still rely solely on natural language, exchanging tokens or their
embeddings. To go beyond language, we introduce a new paradigm, thought
communication, which enables agents to interact directly mind-to-mind, akin to
telepathy. To uncover these latent thoughts in a principled way, we formalize
the process as a general latent variable model, where agent states are
generated by an unknown function of underlying thoughts. We prove that, in a
nonparametric setting without auxiliary information, both shared and private
latent thoughts between any pair of agents can be identified. Moreover, the
global structure of thought sharing, including which agents share which
thoughts and how these relationships are structured, can also be recovered with
theoretical guarantees. Guided by the established theory, we develop a
framework that extracts latent thoughts from all agents prior to communication
and assigns each agent the relevant thoughts, along with their sharing
patterns. This paradigm naturally extends beyond LLMs to all modalities, as
most observational data arise from hidden generative processes. Experiments on
both synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate the theory and demonstrate
the collaborative advantages of thought communication. We hope this work
illuminates the potential of leveraging the hidden world, as many challenges
remain unsolvable through surface-level observation alone, regardless of
compute or data scale.

### [273] [Amplifying Prominent Representations in Multimodal Learning via Variational Dirichlet Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20736)
*Tsai Hor Chan,Feng Wu,Yihang Chen,Guosheng Yin,Lequan Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于狄利克雷过程的多模态学习框架，通过DP的富者愈富特性自动平衡模态内特征学习和跨模态对齐，在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态融合中如何在保持各模态特征表达能力的同时学习跨模态交互的关键挑战。现有方法过度强调模态边缘分布对齐可能导致过度正则化，阻碍有意义的模态内表示学习。

Method: 假设每个模态遵循多元高斯混合分布，采用狄利克雷过程计算所有分量的混合权重。利用DP的富者愈富特性动态分配特征贡献并选择最突出的特征，促进多模态特征融合。

Result: 在多个多模态数据集上的广泛实验表明，该模型优于其他竞争方法。消融分析验证了DP在模态分布对齐方面的有效性及其对关键超参数变化的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 基于狄利克雷过程的多模态学习框架能够自动实现突出的模态内表示学习和跨模态对齐之间的最佳平衡，为多模态融合提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Developing effective multimodal fusion approaches has become increasingly
essential in many real-world scenarios, such as health care and finance. The
key challenge is how to preserve the feature expressiveness in each modality
while learning cross-modal interactions. Previous approaches primarily focus on
the cross-modal alignment, while over-emphasis on the alignment of marginal
distributions of modalities may impose excess regularization and obstruct
meaningful representations within each modality. The Dirichlet process (DP)
mixture model is a powerful Bayesian non-parametric method that can amplify the
most prominent features by its richer-gets-richer property, which allocates
increasing weights to them. Inspired by this unique characteristic of DP, we
propose a new DP-driven multimodal learning framework that automatically
achieves an optimal balance between prominent intra-modal representation
learning and cross-modal alignment. Specifically, we assume that each modality
follows a mixture of multivariate Gaussian distributions and further adopt DP
to calculate the mixture weights for all the components. This paradigm allows
DP to dynamically allocate the contributions of features and select the most
prominent ones, leveraging its richer-gets-richer property, thus facilitating
multimodal feature fusion. Extensive experiments on several multimodal datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of our model over other competitors.
Ablation analysis further validates the effectiveness of DP in aligning
modality distributions and its robustness to changes in key hyperparameters.

### [274] [Out-of-distribution Tests Reveal Compositionality in Chess Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20783)
*Anna Mészáros,Patrik Reizinger,Ferenc Huszár*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了Transformer模型在象棋游戏中的系统泛化能力，发现模型能够进行组合泛化，在分布外场景中仍能遵守游戏规则并生成高质量走法，但在更复杂的变体如Chess960中表现不如符号AI算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究现代决策Transformer是否真正理解象棋规则，而不仅仅是学习训练数据中的模式，通过测试其在分布外场景中的表现来评估其系统泛化能力。

Method: 训练了一个2.7亿参数的象棋Transformer模型，并在多种分布外场景进行测试，包括规则外推、OOD谜题和Chess960变体，同时分析训练动态。

Result: Transformer展现出组合泛化能力，在规则外推和OOD谜题中表现良好；在Chess960中虽然能进行基本策略适应，但不如符号AI算法；训练动态显示模型先学会移动己方棋子。

Conclusion: Transformer能够学习象棋的组合结构，在规则遵守方面表现出色，但在需要深度策略推理的复杂变体中仍不如传统符号AI方法。

Abstract: Chess is a canonical example of a task that requires rigorous reasoning and
long-term planning. Modern decision Transformers - trained similarly to LLMs -
are able to learn competent gameplay, but it is unclear to what extent they
truly capture the rules of chess. To investigate this, we train a 270M
parameter chess Transformer and test it on out-of-distribution scenarios,
designed to reveal failures of systematic generalization. Our analysis shows
that Transformers exhibit compositional generalization, as evidenced by strong
rule extrapolation: they adhere to fundamental syntactic rules of the game by
consistently choosing valid moves even in situations very different from the
training data. Moreover, they also generate high-quality moves for OOD puzzles.
In a more challenging test, we evaluate the models on variants including
Chess960 (Fischer Random Chess) - a variant of chess where starting positions
of pieces are randomized. We found that while the model exhibits basic strategy
adaptation, they are inferior to symbolic AI algorithms that perform explicit
search, but gap is smaller when playing against users on Lichess. Moreover, the
training dynamics revealed that the model initially learns to move only its own
pieces, suggesting an emergent compositional understanding of the game.

### [275] [KL-Regularized Reinforcement Learning is Designed to Mode Collapse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20817)
*Anthony GX-Chen,Jatin Prakash,Jeff Guo,Rob Fergus,Rajesh Ranganath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文挑战了关于反向KL散度导致"模式寻求"、前向KL散度导致"质量覆盖"的常见直觉，发现在强化学习中这种直觉不成立。作者开发了一种简单算法，通过调整奖励幅度来优化目标分布，使其覆盖所有高质量采样模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为反向KL散度会导致模式寻求，前向KL散度会导致质量覆盖，但作者发现这种直觉在强化学习（特别是语言模型）中并不成立，需要重新理解KL正则化在RL中的作用。

Method: 作者通过数学分析和实验验证，发现模式覆盖主要取决于正则化强度、奖励和参考概率的相对尺度等因素。基于这些洞察，他们构建了一个简单、可扩展且理论合理的算法，通过最小化地调整奖励幅度来优化目标分布。

Result: 实验表明，这种简单修改能够在大语言模型和化学语言模型的后训练中提高解决方案的质量和多样性，无需外部多样性信号，并且在前向和反向KL都失败的情况下仍能工作。

Conclusion: 选择反向/前向KL决定了最优目标分布的参数化家族，模式覆盖主要取决于其他因素。作者的方法通过调整奖励幅度，成功优化了覆盖所有高质量采样模式的目标分布。

Abstract: It is commonly believed that optimizing the reverse KL divergence results in
"mode seeking", while optimizing forward KL results in "mass covering", with
the latter being preferred if the goal is to sample from multiple diverse
modes. We show -- mathematically and empirically -- that this intuition does
not necessarily transfer well to doing reinforcement learning with
reverse/forward KL regularization (e.g. as commonly used with language models).
Instead, the choice of reverse/forward KL determines the family of optimal
target distributions, parameterized by the regularization coefficient. Mode
coverage depends primarily on other factors, such as regularization strength,
and relative scales between rewards and reference probabilities. Further, we
show commonly used settings such as low regularization strength and equal
verifiable rewards tend to specify unimodal target distributions, meaning the
optimization objective is, by construction, non-diverse. We leverage these
insights to construct a simple, scalable, and theoretically justified
algorithm. It makes minimal changes to reward magnitudes, yet optimizes for a
target distribution which puts high probability over all high-quality sampling
modes. In experiments, this simple modification works to post-train both Large
Language Models and Chemical Language Models to have higher solution quality
and diversity, without any external signals of diversity, and works with both
forward and reverse KL when using either naively fails.

### [276] [Optimized Distortion in Linear Social Choice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20020)
*Luise Ge,Gregory Kehne,Yevgeniy Vorobeychik*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文研究了线性效用函数下的社会选择扭曲问题，提出了基于候选嵌入维度的扭曲界限，并开发了多项式时间的实例最优算法来最小化扭曲。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统社会选择理论基于偏好排序可能导致次优结果，而许多实际场景中候选者具有向量表示，效用是参数的线性函数，因此需要研究线性效用函数下的扭曲问题。

Method: 研究确定性和随机投票规则的线性社会选择扭曲，提出多项式时间的实例最优算法，并在推荐系统和意见调查两个真实场景中进行实证评估。

Result: 获得了仅依赖于候选嵌入维度而不依赖于候选者或选民数量的扭曲界限，实例最优算法在实验中优于标准规则。

Conclusion: 线性效用函数下的社会选择扭曲可以通过基于嵌入维度的界限来刻画，实例最优算法在实际应用中表现优异。

Abstract: Social choice theory offers a wealth of approaches for selecting a candidate
on behalf of voters based on their reported preference rankings over options.
When voters have underlying utilities for these options, however, using
preference rankings may lead to suboptimal outcomes vis-\`a-vis utilitarian
social welfare. Distortion is a measure of this suboptimality, and provides a
worst-case approach for developing and analyzing voting rules when utilities
have minimal structure. However in many settings, such as common paradigms for
value alignment, alternatives admit a vector representation, and it is natural
to suppose that utilities are parametric functions thereof. We undertake the
first study of distortion for linear utility functions. Specifically, we
investigate the distortion of linear social choice for deterministic and
randomized voting rules. We obtain bounds that depend only on the dimension of
the candidate embedding, and are independent of the numbers of candidates or
voters. Additionally, we introduce poly-time instance-optimal algorithms for
minimizing distortion given a collection of candidates and votes. We
empirically evaluate these in two real-world domains: recommendation systems
using collaborative filtering embeddings, and opinion surveys utilizing
language model embeddings, benchmarking several standard rules against our
instance-optimal algorithms.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文通过博弈论模型分析，揭示了在表面公平的择优制度中，不同社会经济群体对入选后价值的感知差异如何理性地导致努力程度差异，从而在看似公平的选择过程中传播不平等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解释择优制度中持续存在的种族、性别和阶级差距问题，挑战了纯粹基于技能和努力就能获得公平回报的理想化假设，试图弥合结构性不平等和个人理性选择两种解释之间的鸿沟。

Method: 开发了一个博弈论模型，其中来自不同社会经济群体的候选人在感知入选后价值上存在差异，每个候选人战略性地选择努力程度，平衡成本与预期回报，努力转化为可观察的绩效，选择仅基于绩效。

Result: 在大代理极限下刻画了唯一的纳什均衡，推导出明确公式显示估值差异和机构选择性如何共同决定努力程度、代表性、社会福利和效用。提出了成本敏感优化框架来减少差距而不损害机构目标。

Conclusion: 揭示了感知驱动的偏见：当不同群体对入选后价值的感知存在差异时，这些差异会转化为努力程度的理性差异，通过原本'公平'的选择过程向后传播不平等。模型展示了技术社会环境如何塑造择优系统中个人激励，连接了理性选择和结构性不平等解释。

Abstract: Meritocratic systems, from admissions to hiring, aim to impartially reward
skill and effort. Yet persistent disparities across race, gender, and class
challenge this ideal. Some attribute these gaps to structural inequality;
others to individual choice. We develop a game-theoretic model in which
candidates from different socioeconomic groups differ in their perceived
post-selection value--shaped by social context and, increasingly, by AI-powered
tools offering personalized career or salary guidance. Each candidate
strategically chooses effort, balancing its cost against expected reward;
effort translates into observable merit, and selection is based solely on
merit. We characterize the unique Nash equilibrium in the large-agent limit and
derive explicit formulas showing how valuation disparities and institutional
selectivity jointly determine effort, representation, social welfare, and
utility. We further propose a cost-sensitive optimization framework that
quantifies how modifying selectivity or perceived value can reduce disparities
without compromising institutional goals. Our analysis reveals a
perception-driven bias: when perceptions of post-selection value differ across
groups, these differences translate into rational differences in effort,
propagating disparities backward through otherwise "fair" selection processes.
While the model is static, it captures one stage of a broader feedback cycle
linking perceptions, incentives, and outcome--bridging rational-choice and
structural explanations of inequality by showing how techno-social environments
shape individual incentives in meritocratic systems.

*Max B. Zhao,Fei Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种量子启发的算法，使用矩阵乘积态(MPS)和密度矩阵重整化群(DMRG)方法解决QUBO问题，在数独和MaxCut问题上验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决二次无约束二进制优化(QUBO)问题，这些问题在数学上等价于寻找Ising自旋玻璃哈密顿量的基态。

Method: 使用矩阵乘积态(MPS)紧凑表示自旋构型的大叠加，采用离散驱动调度引导MPS向基态演化，结合驱动哈密顿量和问题哈密顿量实现自旋翻转和量子隧穿，通过DMRG方法迭代最小化系统能量。

Result: 算法可靠地识别全局最小值而非仅近似解，在超过200个Ising自旋的数独问题和Biq Mac库中最多251节点、3265边的MaxCut问题上成功求解。

Conclusion: 该量子启发方法具有可扩展性、通用性和适用于工业规模QUBO应用的优势。

Abstract: We propose and evaluate a quantum-inspired algorithm for solving Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, which are mathematically
equivalent to finding ground states of Ising spin-glass Hamiltonians. The
algorithm employs Matrix Product States (MPS) to compactly represent large
superpositions of spin configurations and utilizes a discrete driving schedule
to guide the MPS toward the ground state. At each step, a driver Hamiltonian --
incorporating a transverse magnetic field -- is combined with the problem
Hamiltonian to enable spin flips and facilitate quantum tunneling. The MPS is
updated using the standard Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method,
which iteratively minimizes the system's energy via multiple sweeps across the
spin chain. Despite its heuristic nature, the algorithm reliably identifies
global minima, not merely near-optimal solutions, across diverse QUBO
instances. We first demonstrate its effectiveness on intermediate-level Sudoku
puzzles from publicly available sources, involving over $200$ Ising spins with
long-range couplings dictated by constraint satisfaction. We then apply the
algorithm to MaxCut problems from the Biq Mac library, successfully solving
instances with up to $251$ nodes and $3,265$ edges. We discuss the advantages
of this quantum-inspired approach, including its scalability, generalizability,
and suitability for industrial-scale QUBO applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了分析可靠性基准(ARB)，这是首个用于量化大语言模型在能源系统分析中推理可靠性的标准化框架，包含五个子指标，并在四种前沿模型上进行了验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI在能源领域的应用缺乏标准化框架来评估系统推理的正确性，现有验证方法主要关注预测准确性或计算效率，而忽略了分析结论的逻辑完整性。

Method: 开发了ARB框架，包含准确性、推理可靠性、不确定性纪律、政策一致性和透明度五个子指标，使用公开技术经济数据集(NREL ATB 2024等)在确定性、概率性和认知性场景下评估模型性能。

Result: GPT-4/5和Claude 4.5 Sonnet达到了稳定且政策合规的推理(分析可靠性指数大于90)，Gemini 2.5 Pro表现中等，Llama 3 70B低于专业阈值，统计验证表明这些差异显著且可重现。

Conclusion: ARB建立了能源文献中首个验证AI系统因果、概率和政策驱动推理的定量方法，为全球能源转型中可信赖和透明的分析应用提供了参考框架。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasingly used for
forecasting, optimization, and policy design in the energy sector, yet no
standardized framework exists to evaluate whether these systems reason
correctly. Current validation practices focus on predictive accuracy or
computational efficiency, leaving the logical integrity of analytical
conclusions untested. This study introduces the Analytical Reliability
Benchmark (ARB), a reproducible framework that quantifies reasoning reliability
in large language models applied to energy system analysis. The benchmark
integrates five submetrics: accuracy, reasoning reliability, uncertainty
discipline, policy consistency, and transparency, and evaluates model
performance across deterministic, probabilistic, and epistemic scenarios using
open technoeconomic datasets (NREL ATB 2024, DOE H2A/H2New, IEA WEO 2024). Four
frontier models (GPT-4/5, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B) were
tested under identical factual and regulatory conditions. Results show that
reasoning reliability can be objectively measured. GPT-4/5 and Claude 4.5
Sonnet achieved consistent and policy-compliant reasoning (Analytical
Reliability Index greater than 90), Gemini 2.5 Pro demonstrated moderate
stability, and Llama 3 70B remained below professional thresholds. Statistical
validation confirmed that these differences are significant and reproducible.
The ARB establishes the first quantitative method in the energy literature for
verifying causal, probabilistic, and policy-driven reasoning in artificial
intelligence systems, providing a reference framework for trustworthy and
transparent analytical applications in the global energy transition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的自主网页代理在多步推理和回溯方面存在局限，线性方法无法处理复杂推理，其他搜索策略则计算成本高昂且粒度粗糙。

Method: 采用细粒度网页代理框架，包含：1）显式子任务管理和树状结构探索实现可控多分支推理；2）通过网页状态回放和后台推理引导探索；3）利用页面动作记忆在会话内外共享探索动作。

Result: 在WebArena基准测试中，任务成功率达到35.8%，执行时间相比最先进方法减少高达40.4%。

Conclusion: Branch-and-Browse是一个可靠且高效的基于LLM的网页代理框架，在推理深度和执行效率方面显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Autonomous web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) show strong
potential for performing goal-oriented tasks such as information retrieval,
report generation, and online transactions. These agents mark a key step toward
practical embodied reasoning in open web environments. However, existing
approaches remain limited in reasoning depth and efficiency: vanilla linear
methods fail at multi-step reasoning and lack effective backtracking, while
other search strategies are coarse-grained and computationally costly. We
introduce Branch-and-Browse, a fine-grained web agent framework that unifies
structured reasoning-acting, contextual memory, and efficient execution. It (i)
employs explicit subtask management with tree-structured exploration for
controllable multi-branch reasoning, (ii) bootstraps exploration through
efficient web state replay with background reasoning, and (iii) leverages a
page action memory to share explored actions within and across sessions. On the
WebArena benchmark, Branch-and-Browse achieves a task success rate of 35.8\%
and reduces execution time by up to 40.4\% relative to state-of-the-art
methods. These results demonstrate that Branch-and-Browse is a reliable and
efficient framework for LLM-based web agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法区分LLMs在数学问题上的成功是源于搜索、死记硬背还是规则一致的推理过程，需要更精细的评估框架。

Method: 将思维链建模为基于规则的随机过程，引入逻辑接近度指标，并创建DAG-MATH CoT格式的基准测试。

Result: 在标准数学推理数据集上发现，即使PASS@k指标相似，不同LLM家族在推理保真度上存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 该框架在自由形式思维链和形式证明系统之间提供了平衡，为LLMs推理评估提供了可操作的诊断工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on mathematical
problems when prompted with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), yet it remains unclear
whether this success stems from search, rote procedures, or rule-consistent
reasoning. To address this, we propose modeling CoT as a certain rule-based
stochastic process over directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where nodes represent
intermediate derivation states and edges encode rule applications. Within this
framework, we introduce logical closeness, a metric that quantifies how well a
model's CoT trajectory (i.e., the LLM's final output) adheres to the DAG
structure, providing evaluation beyond classical PASS@k metrics. Building on
this, we introduce the DAG-MATH CoT format and construct a benchmark that
guides LLMs to generate CoT trajectories in this format, thereby enabling the
evaluation of their reasoning ability under our framework. Across standard
mathematical reasoning datasets, our analysis uncovers statistically
significant differences in reasoning fidelity among representative LLM
families-even when PASS@k is comparable-highlighting gaps between final-answer
accuracy and rule-consistent derivation. Our framework provides a balance
between free-form CoT and formal proofs systems, offering actionable
diagnostics for LLMs reasoning evaluation. Our benchmark and code are available

Abstract: Building agents that generalize across web, desktop, and mobile environments

interfaces that limit cross-platform deployment. We introduce Surfer 2, a
unified architecture operating purely from visual observations that achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all three environments. Surfer 2 integrates
hierarchical context management, decoupled planning and execution, and
self-verification with adaptive recovery, enabling reliable operation over long

WebArena, 60.1% on OSWorld, and 87.1% on AndroidWorld, outperforming all prior
systems without task-specific fine-tuning. With multiple attempts, Surfer 2
exceeds human performance on all benchmarks. These results demonstrate that
systematic orchestration amplifies foundation model capabilities and enables
general-purpose computer control through visual interaction alone, while
calling for a next-generation vision language model to achieve Pareto-optimal

Motivation: 现有GNN依赖模式特定的特征编码器，需要为每种节点类型和特征列分别设计模块，这阻碍了可扩展性和参数共享。

Method: 使用共享的模态特定编码器处理分类、数值、文本和时间属性，然后通过Perceiver风格的交叉注意力模块将特征聚合成固定大小的节点表示。

Result: 在RelBench基准测试中，RELATE在ReLGNN和HGT上实现了与模式特定编码器相差3%以内的性能，同时参数数量减少了5倍。

Conclusion: RELATE支持不同模式并实现多数据集预训练，为关系图数据的基础模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Relational multi-table data is common in domains such as e-commerce,
healthcare, and scientific research, and can be naturally represented as
heterogeneous temporal graphs with multi-modal node attributes. Existing graph
neural networks (GNNs) rely on schema-specific feature encoders, requiring
separate modules for each node type and feature column, which hinders
scalability and parameter sharing. We introduce RELATE (Relational Encoder for
Latent Aggregation of Typed Entities), a schema-agnostic, plug-and-play feature
encoder that can be used with any general purpose GNN. RELATE employs shared
modality-specific encoders for categorical, numerical, textual, and temporal
attributes, followed by a Perceiver-style cross-attention module that
aggregates features into a fixed-size, permutation-invariant node
representation. We evaluate RELATE on ReLGNN and HGT in the RelBench benchmark,
where it achieves performance within 3% of schema-specific encoders while
reducing parameter counts by up to 5x. This design supports varying schemas and
enables multi-dataset pretraining for general-purpose GNNs, paving the way
toward foundation models for relational graph data.

Conclusion: UVeye分层解决方案在检测、缓解和威慑车辆保险欺诈方面取得了重大进展，为解决生成式AI加剧的保险欺诈问题提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Generative AI is supercharging insurance fraud by making it easier to falsify
accident evidence at scale and in rapid time. Insurance fraud is a pervasive
and costly problem, amounting to tens of billions of dollars in losses each
year. In the vehicle insurance sector, fraud schemes have traditionally
involved staged accidents, exaggerated damage, or forged documents. The rise of
generative AI, including deepfake image and video generation, has introduced
new methods for committing fraud at scale. Fraudsters can now fabricate highly
realistic crash photos, damage evidence, and even fake identities or documents
with minimal effort, exploiting AI tools to bolster false insurance claims.
Insurers have begun deploying countermeasures such as AI-based deepfake
detection software and enhanced verification processes to detect and mitigate
these AI-driven scams. However, current mitigation strategies face significant
limitations. Detection tools can suffer from false positives and negatives, and
sophisticated fraudsters continuously adapt their tactics to evade automated
checks. This cat-and-mouse arms race between generative AI and detection
technology, combined with resource and cost barriers for insurers, means that
combating AI-enabled insurance fraud remains an ongoing challenge. In this
white paper, we present UVeye layered solution for vehicle fraud, representing
a major leap forward in the ability to detect, mitigate and deter this new wave
of fraud.

Conclusion: 研究证明领导力人格特质可以有效预测学术成功，为早期识别学生优缺点和制定个性化学习策略提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The study explores the potential of AI technologies in personalized learning,
suggesting the prediction of academic success through leadership personality
traits and machine learning modelling. The primary data were obtained from 129
master's students in the Environmental Engineering Department, who underwent
five leadership personality tests with 23 characteristics. Students used
self-assessment tools that included Personality Insight, Workplace Culture,
Motivation at Work, Management Skills, and Emotion Control tests. The test
results were combined with the average grade obtained from academic reports.
The study employed exploratory data analysis and correlation analysis. Feature
selection utilized Pearson correlation coefficients of personality traits. The
average grades were separated into three categories: fail, pass, and excellent.
The modelling process was performed by tuning seven ML algorithms, such as SVM,
LR, KNN, DT, GB, RF, XGBoost and LightGBM. The highest predictive performance
was achieved with the RF classifier, which yielded an accuracy of 87.50% for
the model incorporating 17 personality trait features and the leadership mark
feature, and an accuracy of 85.71% for the model excluding this feature. In
this way, the study offers an additional opportunity to identify students'
strengths and weaknesses at an early stage of their education process and
select the most suitable strategies for personalized learning.

### [286] [LLMs can hide text in other text of the same length.ipynb](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20075)
*Antonio Norelli,Michael Bronstein*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种使用大型语言模型将秘密信息隐藏在看似普通文本中的协议，展示了文本与作者意图的彻底分离，对AI安全和信任构成威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型如何能够将完全不同的信息隐藏在看似连贯合理的文本中，揭示文本与作者意图之间的根本性分离问题。

Method: 使用简单的协议，即使是8B参数的开放源代码LLM也能在笔记本电脑上快速编码和解码隐藏信息。

Result: 证明了即使是中等规模的LLM也能产生高质量的结果，可以在几秒钟内编码和解码像摘要这么长的信息。

Conclusion: 这种协议的存在进一步削弱了对书面通信的信任，对AI安全提出了紧迫问题，并挑战了我们对LLM知识理解的基础。

Abstract: A meaningful text can be hidden inside another, completely different yet
still coherent and plausible, text of the same length. For example, a tweet
containing a harsh political critique could be embedded in a tweet that
celebrates the same political leader, or an ordinary product review could
conceal a secret manuscript. This uncanny state of affairs is now possible
thanks to Large Language Models, and in this paper we present a simple and
efficient protocol to achieve it. We show that even modest 8-billion-parameter
open-source LLMs are sufficient to obtain high-quality results, and a message
as long as this abstract can be encoded and decoded locally on a laptop in
seconds. The existence of such a protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of
text from authorial intent, further eroding trust in written communication,
already shaken by the rise of LLM chatbots. We illustrate this with a concrete
scenario: a company could covertly deploy an unfiltered LLM by encoding its
answers within the compliant responses of a safe model. This possibility raises
urgent questions for AI safety and challenges our understanding of what it
means for a Large Language Model to know something.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI PB是一个生产级的生成式代理系统，在零售金融领域部署，能够主动生成基于事实、合规且个性化的投资洞察，而非被动回答问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在金融领域，传统聊天机器人只能被动回答问题，无法主动提供个性化的投资建议。需要开发一个能够在严格监管环境下主动生成可信投资洞察的系统。

Method: 采用组件化编排层进行确定性路由决策，结合混合检索管道（OpenSearch+金融领域嵌入模型）和多阶段推荐机制（规则启发式、序列行为建模、上下文赌博机），完全在本地部署运行。

Result: 系统在24个NVIDIA H100 GPU上通过Docker Swarm和vLLM部署，通过人工QA和系统指标验证，证明基于事实的生成与显式路由和分层安全机制能够在高风险金融环境中提供可信的AI洞察。

Conclusion: 在金融等高风险领域，通过显式路由、分层安全机制和基于事实的生成，可以构建可信的AI洞察系统，满足监管要求并提供个性化服务。

Abstract: We present AI PB, a production-scale generative agent deployed in real retail
finance. Unlike reactive chatbots that answer queries passively, AI PB
proactively generates grounded, compliant, and user-specific investment
insights. It integrates (i) a component-based orchestration layer that
deterministically routes between internal and external LLMs based on data
sensitivity, (ii) a hybrid retrieval pipeline using OpenSearch and the
finance-domain embedding model, and (iii) a multi-stage recommendation
mechanism combining rule heuristics, sequential behavioral modeling, and
contextual bandits. Operating fully on-premises under Korean financial
regulations, the system employs Docker Swarm and vLLM across 24 X NVIDIA H100
GPUs. Through human QA and system metrics, we demonstrate that grounded
generation with explicit routing and layered safety can deliver trustworthy AI
insights in high-stakes finance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HCLA是一个以人为中心的多智能体系统，用于数字资产交易异常检测，通过解析、检测和解释三个角色组成的对话工作流，让非专家能够用自然语言提问、检查结构化分析并获得上下文感知的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高金融取证中的透明度和信任度，让非专家用户能够理解和参与异常检测过程，解决传统检测系统缺乏可解释性的问题。

Method: 采用多智能体系统架构，包含解析、检测和解释三个角色，将用户意图转换为经典检测器（XGBoost）的模式，并提供基于底层特征的叙述性解释。

Result: 在标记的比特币混币数据集（Wasabi Wallet，2020-2024）上，基线检测器达到强准确率，而HCLA增加了可解释性和交互式优化能力。

Conclusion: 人在回路的设计提高了金融取证中的透明度和信任度，HCLA系统成功地将技术检测能力与用户友好的解释功能相结合。

Abstract: We present HCLA, a human-centered multi-agent system for anomaly detection in
digital asset transactions. The system links three roles: Parsing, Detection,
and Explanation, into a conversational workflow that lets non-experts ask
questions in natural language, inspect structured analytics, and obtain
context-aware rationales. Implemented with an open-source web UI, HCLA
translates user intents into a schema for a classical detector (XGBoost in our
prototype) and returns narrative explanations grounded in the underlying
features. On a labeled Bitcoin mixing dataset (Wasabi Wallet, 2020-2024), the
baseline detector reaches strong accuracy, while HCLA adds interpretability and
interactive refinement. We describe the architecture, interaction loop,
dataset, evaluation protocol, and limitations, and discuss how a
human-in-the-loop design improves transparency and trust in financial
forensics.

### [289] [The Verification-Value Paradox: A Normative Critique of Gen AI in Legal Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20109)
*Joshua Yuvaraj*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文认为需要重新评估AI在法律实践中的应用，提出了"验证-价值悖论"，指出AI带来的效率提升会被相应的验证需求所抵消，导致净价值往往可以忽略不计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对AI在法律实践中应用的乐观假设需要重新审视，因为律师因提交不准确的AI生成内容而受到谴责的案例表明，必须考虑AI与现实脱节、缺乏透明度以及律师的核心职责（如诚实、正直、不误导法庭）之间的冲突。

Method: 提出了一个替代模型来评估AI在法律实践中的应用，即"验证-价值悖论"，该模型更全面地反映了AI的特性和律师的职责要求。

Result: 验证-价值悖论表明，AI在法律实践中带来的效率提升会被相应增加的输出验证需求所抵消，导致AI使用的净价值往往可以忽略不计。

Conclusion: 论文阐述了该悖论对法律实践和法律教育的影响，强调需要以对真理的忠诚和公民责任为基础价值观来指导AI的使用。

Abstract: It is often claimed that machine learning-based generative AI products will
drastically streamline and reduce the cost of legal practice. This enthusiasm
assumes lawyers can effectively manage AI's risks. Cases in Australia and
elsewhere in which lawyers have been reprimanded for submitting inaccurate
AI-generated content to courts suggest this paradigm must be revisited. This
paper argues that a new paradigm is needed to evaluate AI use in practice,
given (a) AI's disconnection from reality and its lack of transparency, and (b)
lawyers' paramount duties like honesty, integrity, and not to mislead the
court. It presents an alternative model of AI use in practice that more
holistically reflects these features (the verification-value paradox). That
paradox suggests increases in efficiency from AI use in legal practice will be
met by a correspondingly greater imperative to manually verify any outputs of
that use, rendering the net value of AI use often negligible to lawyers. The
paper then sets out the paradox's implications for legal practice and legal
education, including for AI use but also the values that the paradox suggests
should undergird legal practice: fidelity to the truth and civic
responsibility.

*Morris Yu-Chao Huang,Zhen Tan,Mohan Zhang,Pingzhi Li,Zhuo Zhang,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了TRUST框架，一个去中心化的AI审计系统，通过共识机制、分层DAG分解、区块链记录和隐私保护分段来解决大语言模型推理链的验证问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有审计方法存在集中化、不透明、难以扩展的问题，无法有效验证大语言模型推理链的忠实性和无害性，存在高风险部署障碍。

Method: 采用共识机制确保在30%恶意参与者下仍能保证正确性；使用分层DAG分解推理链实现可扩展并行审计；通过区块链记录验证决策确保公开问责；实施隐私保护分段仅共享部分推理步骤。

Result: 在多个LLM（GPT-OSS、DeepSeek-r1、Qwen）和推理任务（数学、医学、科学、人文）上的实验表明，TRUST能有效检测推理缺陷并抵抗对抗性审计。

Conclusion: TRUST框架开创了去中心化AI审计的先河，为大语言模型的安全可信部署提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models generate complex reasoning chains that reveal their
decision-making, yet verifying the faithfulness and harmlessness of these
intermediate steps remains a critical unsolved problem. Existing auditing
methods are centralized, opaque, and hard to scale, creating significant risks
for deploying proprietary models in high-stakes domains. We identify four core
challenges: (1) Robustness: Centralized auditors are single points of failure,
prone to bias or attacks. (2) Scalability: Reasoning traces are too long for
manual verification. (3) Opacity: Closed auditing undermines public trust. (4)
Privacy: Exposing full reasoning risks model theft or distillation. We propose
TRUST, a transparent, decentralized auditing framework that overcomes these
limitations via: (1) A consensus mechanism among diverse auditors, guaranteeing
correctness under up to $30\%$ malicious participants. (2) A hierarchical DAG
decomposition of reasoning traces, enabling scalable, parallel auditing. (3) A
blockchain ledger that records all verification decisions for public
accountability. (4) Privacy-preserving segmentation, sharing only partial
reasoning steps to protect proprietary logic. We provide theoretical guarantees
for the security and economic incentives of the TRUST framework. Experiments
across multiple LLMs (GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-r1, Qwen) and reasoning tasks (math,
medical, science, humanities) show TRUST effectively detects reasoning flaws
and remains robust against adversarial auditors. Our work pioneers
decentralized AI auditing, offering a practical path toward safe and
trustworthy LLM deployment.

*Marcelo Maciel Amaral,Raymond Aschheim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出AGI发展需要经历身份固化阶段，从开放模仿转向稳定身份，并建立了检测指标。实验表明不同规模模型在固化过程中表现各异，这种固化对AGI可靠性和安全性至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型过于开放和可操控，而真正的AGI发展需要经历身份固化阶段，使目标结构、拒绝行为、偏好和内部表征变得稳定且抵抗外部操控。

Method: 通过形式化身份固化阶段，将其与学习动力学现象关联，并提出操作性检测指标。在不同规模模型上进行实验验证。

Result: 行为固化快速且非线性，但对通用能力的影响各异：小模型出现性能权衡，中等规模模型几乎无成本地适应，大型量化模型出现瞬时不稳定性。

Conclusion: 身份固化是AGI级可靠性的先决条件，也是关键的安全控制点。身份可以被工程化设计以提高可靠性，但也可能在扩展过程中自发形成，导致不可预测的目标和行为固化。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain broadly open and highly steerable: they
imitate at scale, accept arbitrary system prompts, and readily adopt multiple
personae. By analogy to human development, we hypothesize that progress toward
artificial general intelligence (AGI) involves a lock-in phase: a transition
from open imitation to identity consolidation, in which goal structures,
refusals, preferences, and internal representations become comparatively stable
and resistant to external steering. We formalize this phase, link it to known
phenomena in learning dynamics, and propose operational metrics for onset
detection. Experimentally, we demonstrate that while the behavioral
consolidation is rapid and non-linear, its side-effects on general capabilities
are not monolithic. Our results reveal a spectrum of outcomes--from performance
trade-offs in small models, through largely cost-free adoption in mid-scale
models, to transient instabilities in large, quantized models. We argue that
such consolidation is a prerequisite for AGI-level reliability and also a
critical control point for safety: identities can be deliberately engineered
for reliability, yet may also emerge spontaneously during scaling, potentially
hardening unpredictable goals and behaviors.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在动态环境中优化AI的方法，使用2048游戏作为测试平台，比较了单智能体价值函数优化和双智能体元提示两种进化训练方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化AI在动态环境中的性能是机器学习研究的基本挑战，2048游戏结合了策略性和随机性，是研究决策制定、长期规划和动态适应的理想平台。

Method: 实现了两种系统：双智能体元提示系统（一个"思考者"LLM为"执行者"LLM优化策略）和基于价值函数优化的单智能体系统，结合了有限的蒙特卡洛树搜索和回滚功能。

Result: 单智能体系统取得了显著改进，每个训练周期平均增加473.2分，且呈现明显上升趋势（相关系数ρ=0.607）。LLM对游戏的理解也随着高级策略的发展而增长。双智能体系统改进有限。

Conclusion: 进化精炼技术在非确定性环境中改善AI性能具有潜力，但元提示方法存在固有局限性。

Abstract: Optimizing artificial intelligence (AI) for dynamic environments remains a
fundamental challenge in machine learning research. In this paper, we examine
evolutionary training methods for optimizing AI to solve the game 2048, a 2D
sliding puzzle. 2048, with its mix of strategic gameplay and stochastic
elements, presents an ideal playground for studying decision-making, long-term
planning, and dynamic adaptation. We implemented two distinct systems: a
two-agent metaprompting system where a "thinker" large language model (LLM)
agent refines gameplay strategies for an "executor" LLM agent, and a
single-agent system based on refining a value function for a limited Monte
Carlo Tree Search. We also experimented with rollback features to avoid
performance degradation. Our results demonstrate the potential of evolutionary
refinement techniques in improving AI performance in non-deterministic
environments. The single-agent system achieved substantial improvements, with
an average increase of 473.2 points per cycle, and with clear upward trends
(correlation $\rho$=0.607) across training cycles. The LLM's understanding of
the game grew as well, shown in its development of increasingly advanced
strategies. Conversely, the two-agent system did not garner much improvement,
highlighting the inherent limits of meta-prompting.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文评估了大型语言模型在个体化认知模拟中的能力，通过小说作者风格模仿任务测试了不同认知表征方法的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLMs能够模拟表面的人类行为，但它们在模拟更深层次个体化认知过程方面的能力尚不清楚，需要系统评估。

Method: 构建基于近期小说的数据集，提出11条件认知评估框架，测试7个现成LLMs在作者风格模仿中的表现，比较不同认知表征方法（语言特征、概念映射、基于档案的信息）。

Result: 概念和语言特征的组合在个体化认知模拟中特别有效，优于基于静态档案的线索。LLMs更擅长模仿语言风格而非叙事结构。

Conclusion: 这些发现为开发能够适应个体思维和表达方式的AI系统奠定了基础，推动了更个性化和人类对齐的创意技术发展。

Abstract: Individualized cognitive simulation (ICS) aims to build computational models
that approximate the thought processes of specific individuals. While large
language models (LLMs) convincingly mimic surface-level human behavior such as
role-play, their ability to simulate deeper individualized cognitive processes
remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we introduce a novel task that
evaluates different cognitive representation methods in ICS. We construct a
dataset from recently published novels (later than the release date of the
tested LLMs) and propose an 11-condition cognitive evaluation framework to
benchmark seven off-the-shelf LLMs in the context of authorial style emulation.
We hypothesize that effective cognitive representations can help LLMs generate
storytelling that better mirrors the original author. Thus, we test different
cognitive representations, e.g., linguistic features, concept mappings, and
profile-based information. Results show that combining conceptual and
linguistic features is particularly effective in ICS, outperforming static
profile-based cues in overall evaluation. Importantly, LLMs are more effective
at mimicking linguistic style than narrative structure, underscoring their
limits in deeper cognitive simulation. These findings provide a foundation for
developing AI systems that adapt to individual ways of thinking and expression,
advancing more personalized and human-aligned creative technologies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 使用大型语言模型通过上下文学习生成抽象PDDL领域和问题实例，以自然语言指定的抽象目标为基础，在简单设置下能有效合成规划领域抽象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态领域抽象的选择会影响智能体的规划、推理和解释能力，因此需要一种方法生成与特定目标对齐的抽象。

Method: 在PDDL中建模智能体具体行为，利用LLMs的上下文学习生成抽象PDDL领域和问题实例，考虑三种抽象类别：替代具体动作、具体动作序列、动作/谓词参数及其组合。

Result: GPT-4o在简单设置下能有效合成规划领域抽象，但在抽象动作方面优于抽象相关流。

Conclusion: LLMs在生成规划领域抽象方面具有潜力，特别是在简单场景中，但在抽象流方面仍需改进。

Abstract: Generating an abstraction of a dynamic domain that aligns with a given
purpose remains a significant challenge given that the choice of such an
abstraction can impact an agent's ability to plan, reason, and provide
explanations effectively. We model the agent's concrete behaviors in PDDL and
investigate the use of in-context learning with large language models (LLMs)
for the generation of abstract PDDL domains and problem instances, given an
abstraction objective specified in natural language. The benchmark examples we
use are new and have not been part of the data any LLMs have been trained on.
We consider three categories of abstractions: abstraction of choice of
alternative concrete actions, abstraction of sequences of concrete actions, and
abstraction of action/predicate parameters, as well as combinations of these.
The generated abstract PDDL domains and problem instances are then checked by
symbolic validation tools as well as human experts. Our experiments show that
GPT-4o can generally synthesize useful planning domain abstractions in simple
settings, although it is better at abstracting over actions than over the
associated fluents.

TL;DR: 提出了STaBERT模型，通过整合POI信息和时间描述符来增强人类移动性预测的语义理解，显著提升了预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人类移动性预测模型要么只建模位置序列，要么仅将时间信息作为辅助输入，未能充分利用兴趣点(POI)提供的丰富语义上下文。

Method: 提出STaBERT模型，在BERT-based移动性模型基础上，整合推导的时间描述符和POI嵌入，构建统一的语义增强移动性表示。

Result: 实验结果显示STaBERT显著提升预测精度：单城市预测的GEO-BLEU得分从0.34提升到0.75；多城市预测从0.34提升到0.56。

Conclusion: 整合POI和时间信息能够有效捕捉人类移动的语义基础，显著改善移动性预测性能。

Abstract: Human mobility forecasting is crucial for disaster relief, city planning, and
public health. However, existing models either only model location sequences or
include time information merely as auxiliary input, thereby failing to leverage
the rich semantic context provided by points of interest (POIs). To address
this, we enrich a BERT-based mobility model with derived temporal descriptors
and POI embeddings to better capture the semantics underlying human movement.
We propose STaBERT (Semantic-Temporal aware BERT), which integrates both POI
and temporal information at each location to construct a unified, semantically
enriched representation of mobility. Experimental results show that STaBERT
significantly improves prediction accuracy: for single-city prediction, the
GEO-BLEU score improved from 0.34 to 0.75; for multi-city prediction, from 0.34
to 0.56.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EQA方法直接使用VLMs探索环境而不进行显式思考或规划，限制了推理能力，导致探索效率低下和回答无效。

Method: 提出ToolEQA智能体，集成外部工具进行多步推理；设计自动生成EQA任务的数据管道，构建包含18K任务的EQA-RT数据集。

Result: 在EQA-RT-Seen和EQA-RT-Unseen上，ToolEQA比最先进基线成功率提高9.2~20.2%，比零样本ToolEQA提高10%；在HM-EQA、OpenEQA和EXPRESS-Bench数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: ToolEQA通过集成外部工具和多步推理，显著提升了EQA任务的性能和探索效率，展现了良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) requires agents to explore 3D environments
to obtain observations and answer questions related to the scene. Existing
methods leverage VLMs to directly explore the environment and answer questions
without explicit thinking or planning, which limits their reasoning ability and
results in excessive or inefficient exploration as well as ineffective
responses. In this paper, we introduce ToolEQA, an agent that integrates
external tools with multi-step reasoning, where external tools can provide more
useful information for completing the task, helping the model derive better
exploration directions in the next step of reasoning and thus obtaining
additional effective information. This enables ToolEQA to generate more
accurate responses with a shorter exploration distance. To enhance the model's
ability for tool-usage and multi-step reasoning, we further design a novel EQA
data generation pipeline that automatically constructs large-scale EQA tasks
with reasoning trajectories and corresponding answers. Based on the pipeline,
we collect the EQA-RT dataset that contains about 18K tasks, divided into a
training set EQA-RT-Train, and two test sets EQA-RT-Seen (scenes overlapping
with the training set) and EQA-RT-Unseen (novel scenes). Experiments on
EQA-RT-Seen and EQA-RT-Unseen show that ToolEQA improves the success rate by
9.2~20.2% over state-of-the-art baselines, while outperforming the zero-shot
ToolEQA by 10% in success rate. In addition, ToolEQA also achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the HM-EQA, OpenEQA, and EXPRESS-Bench
datasets, demonstrating its generality. Our homepage see

Motivation: 解决医疗AI在现实临床实践中应用受限的问题，主要障碍是训练数据的质量和公平性受到偏见数据收集实践的影响

Method: 基于西班牙国家研发计划AI4HealthyAging项目的实践经验，识别临床数据收集中存在的多种偏见类型

Result: 识别出历史偏见、代表性偏见和测量偏见等多种偏见类型，这些偏见体现在性别、年龄、居住环境、社会经济地位、设备和标签等变量中

Conclusion: 提出了改善临床问题设计和数据收集公平性与稳健性的实用建议，为开发更公平的医疗AI系统提供指导

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for transforming healthcare.
However, despite significant advances, the integration of AI solutions into
real-world clinical practice remains limited. A major barrier is the quality
and fairness of training data, which is often compromised by biased data
collection practices. This paper draws on insights from the AI4HealthyAging
project, part of Spain's national R&D initiative, where our task was to detect
biases during clinical data collection. We identify several types of bias
across multiple use cases, including historical, representation, and
measurement biases. These biases manifest in variables such as sex, gender,
age, habitat, socioeconomic status, equipment, and labeling. We conclude with
practical recommendations for improving the fairness and robustness of clinical
problem design and data collection. We hope that our findings and experience
contribute to guiding future projects in the development of fairer AI systems
in healthcare.

Abstract: In an era where AI (Artificial Intelligence) systems play an increasing role
in the battlefield, ensuring responsible targeting demands rigorous assessment
of potential collateral effects. In this context, a novel collateral damage
assessment model for target engagement of AI systems in military operations is
introduced. The model integrates temporal, spatial, and force dimensions within
a unified Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) architecture following a
design science methodological approach. Its layered structure captures the
categories and architectural components of the AI systems to be engaged
together with corresponding engaging vectors and contextual aspects. At the
same time, spreading, severity, likelihood, and evaluation metrics are
considered in order to provide a clear representation enhanced by transparent
reasoning mechanisms. Further, the model is demonstrated and evaluated through
instantiation which serves as a basis for further dedicated efforts that aim at
building responsible and trustworthy intelligent systems for assessing the
effects produced by engaging AI systems in military operations.

paradigm-shifting from rule-based and statistical pipelines to language-driven

recent progress in LLM-empowered knowledge graph construction, systematically
analyzing how LLMs reshape the classical three-layered pipeline of ontology
engineering, knowledge extraction, and knowledge fusion.
  We first revisit traditional KG methodologies to establish conceptual
foundations, and then review emerging LLM-driven approaches from two
complementary perspectives: schema-based paradigms, which emphasize structure,
normalization, and consistency; and schema-free paradigms, which highlight
flexibility, adaptability, and open discovery. Across each stage, we synthesize
representative frameworks, analyze their technical mechanisms, and identify
their limitations.
  Finally, the survey outlines key trends and future research directions,
including KG-based reasoning for LLMs, dynamic knowledge memory for agentic
systems, and multimodal KG construction. Through this systematic review, we aim
to clarify the evolving interplay between LLMs and knowledge graphs, bridging
symbolic knowledge engineering and neural semantic understanding toward the
development of adaptive, explainable, and intelligent knowledge systems.

### [300] [IKnow: Instruction-Knowledge-Aware Continual Pretraining for Effective Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20377)
*Tianyi Zhang,Florian Mai,Lucie Flek*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了IKnow框架，通过指令-响应对话格式的自监督目标，在无需外部资源的情况下实现语言模型的持续预训练，避免指令跟随能力退化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统持续预训练方法会降低指令调优模型的指令跟随能力和语义表示，且现有解决方案需要访问原始基础模型或外部领域数据库，这在基础模型权重不可用或可靠外部语料库不可得时存在现实障碍。

Method: IKnow框架在指令-响应对话格式中制定新颖的自监督目标，利用文本中嵌入的领域知识，在更深语义层次进行编码学习。

Result: 该方法能够在无需外部资源的情况下有效适应新领域，保持模型的指令跟随能力。

Conclusion: IKnow提供了一个简单通用的持续适应框架，解决了传统方法对基础模型和外部数据库的依赖问题。

Abstract: Continual pretraining promises to adapt large language models (LLMs) to new
domains using only unlabeled test-time data, but naively applying standard
self-supervised objectives to instruction-tuned models is known to degrade
their instruction-following capability and semantic representations. Existing
fixes assume access to the original base model or rely on knowledge from an
external domain-specific database - both of which pose a realistic barrier in
settings where the base model weights are withheld for safety reasons or
reliable external corpora are unavailable. In this work, we propose
Instruction-Knowledge-Aware Continual Adaptation (IKnow), a simple and general
framework that formulates novel self-supervised objectives in the
instruction-response dialogue format. Rather than depend- ing on external
resources, IKnow leverages domain knowledge embedded within the text itself and
learns to encode it at a deeper semantic level.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI模型在生成创新机会时难以平衡新颖性和实用性，需要开发专门的计算模型来产生既新颖又有用的创新机会

Method: 开发了包含五个功能模块的计算模型，这些功能基于创造力理论和技巧设计，旨在提升创新机会的新颖性而不损失实用性

Result: 在酒店业创新项目中的评估显示，该模型生成的成果比Notebook LM和ChatGPT4o更具新颖性和/或实用性，但并非所有功能模块都对提升新颖性有贡献

Conclusion: 该计算模型在生成高新颖性创新机会方面表现出色，但部分功能需要进一步优化，为模型开发提供了新的研究方向

Abstract: This paper presents a new computational model of creative outcomes, informed
by creativity theories and techniques, which was implemented to generate more
novel opportunities for innovation projects. The model implemented five
functions that were developed to contribute to the generation of innovation
opportunities with higher novelty without loss of usefulness. The model was
evaluated using opportunities generated for an innovation project in the
hospitality sector. The evaluation revealed that the computational model
generated outcomes that were more novel and/or useful than outcomes from
Notebook LM and ChatGPT4o. However, not all model functions contributed to the
generation of more novel opportunities, leading to new directions for further

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为EBR的神经推理器，使用嵌入来近似符号推理器的结果，解决了传统描述逻辑推理器对不一致和错误数据不鲁棒的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的神经符号概念学习方法在真实世界知识库中部署困难，因为使用的描述逻辑推理器对不一致和错误数据不鲁棒。

Method: EBR神经推理器依赖嵌入来近似符号推理器的结果，仅需检索原子概念和存在限制的实例就能近似任何SHOIQ描述逻辑概念的实例集。

Result: 实验表明EBR在处理缺失和错误数据方面比现有推理器更鲁棒。

Conclusion: EBR为在真实世界知识库中部署神经符号概念学习方法提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Concept learning exploits background knowledge in the form of description
logic axioms to learn explainable classification models from knowledge bases.
Despite recent breakthroughs in neuro-symbolic concept learning, most
approaches still cannot be deployed on real-world knowledge bases. This is due
to their use of description logic reasoners, which are not robust against
inconsistencies nor erroneous data. We address this challenge by presenting a
novel neural reasoner dubbed EBR. Our reasoner relies on embeddings to
approximate the results of a symbolic reasoner. We show that EBR solely
requires retrieving instances for atomic concepts and existential restrictions
to retrieve or approximate the set of instances of any concept in the
description logic $\mathcal{SHOIQ}$. In our experiments, we compare EBR with
state-of-the-art reasoners. Our results suggest that EBR is robust against
missing and erroneous data in contrast to existing reasoners.

TL;DR: FLORA是一种无需训练数据的知识图谱对齐方法，基于模糊逻辑提供可解释的实体和关系对齐，支持悬空实体处理并在主要基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱对齐方法主要关注纯实体级对齐，缺乏可解释性推理且需要训练数据才能工作。

Method: 基于模糊逻辑的迭代方法，提供实体和关系的整体对齐，理论上可证明收敛，并允许存在悬空实体。

Result: 在主要基准测试中实现了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: FLORA是一种简单有效的无监督知识图谱对齐方法，具有可解释性、收敛性和对悬空实体的支持等优势。

Abstract: Knowledge graph alignment is the task of matching equivalent entities (that
is, instances and classes) and relations across two knowledge graphs. Most
existing methods focus on pure entity-level alignment, computing the similarity
of entities in some embedding space. They lack interpretable reasoning and need
training data to work. In this paper, we propose FLORA, a simple yet effective
method that (1) is unsupervised, i.e., does not require training data, (2)
provides a holistic alignment for entities and relations iteratively, (3) is
based on fuzzy logic and thus delivers interpretable results, (4) provably
converges, (5) allows dangling entities, i.e., entities without a counterpart
in the other KG, and (6) achieves state-of-the-art results on major benchmarks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文比较了澳大利亚、哥伦比亚和美国三个国家在AI治理中的公众参与情况，发现政府未能建立有效的对话机制，公众参与率低且政府回应有限，导致参与式AI治理的承诺与实践存在差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI治理中的公众参与问题，因为虽然政府邀请公众对AI风险和政策发表意见，但公众意见在转化为政策时大量流失，错失了建立AI信任的关键机会。

Method: 采用景观分析方法，比较三个国家（澳大利亚、哥伦比亚、美国）政府征集公众反馈的方式以及这些反馈是否影响了治理决策。

Result: 在三个案例中，公民和政策制定者均未建立有意义的对话。政府缺乏吸引多样化声音和宣传征集活动的努力，参与率低于人口的1%，官员对反馈的回应有限。

Conclusion: 当前方法不太可能建立AI的信任或合法性，因为政策制定者未能充分听取和回应公众关切。作者提出了八项改进建议，包括提升AI素养、扩大参与范围、使用创新参与方法等。

Abstract: The worlds people have strong opinions about artificial intelligence (AI),
and they want policymakers to listen. Governments are inviting public comment
on AI, but as they translate input into policy, much of what citizens say is
lost. Policymakers are missing a critical opportunity to build trust in AI and
its governance. This paper compares three countries, Australia, Colombia, and
the United States, that invited citizens to comment on AI risks and policies.
Using a landscape analysis, the authors examined how each government solicited
feedback and whether that input shaped governance. Yet in none of the three
cases did citizens and policymakers establish a meaningful dialogue.
Governments did little to attract diverse voices or publicize calls for
comment, leaving most citizens unaware or unprepared to respond. In each
nation, fewer than one percent of the population participated. Moreover,
officials showed limited responsiveness to the feedback they received, failing
to create an effective feedback loop. The study finds a persistent gap between
the promise and practice of participatory AI governance. The authors conclude
that current approaches are unlikely to build trust or legitimacy in AI because
policymakers are not adequately listening or responding to public concerns.
They offer eight recommendations: promote AI literacy; monitor public feedback;
broaden outreach; hold regular online forums; use innovative engagement
methods; include underrepresented groups; respond publicly to input; and make
participation easier.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统混合整数非线性优化方法无法在近实时内解决大规模电网拓扑优化问题，现有机器学习方法在泛化到未见拓扑、变化运行条件和不同系统时存在局限性。

Method: 采用图神经网络加速方法，开发异构边感知消息传递神经网络来预测有效的母线分裂动作作为候选拓扑优化解决方案，考虑线性化交流潮流。

Result: 在GOC 2000节点系统上实现4个数量级的加速，1分钟内提供AC可行解，最优性差距为2.3%，在拓扑和跨系统泛化方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法为实现大规模系统近实时拓扑优化迈出重要一步，具有拓扑变化和跨系统泛化能力。

Abstract: Network topology optimization (NTO) via busbar splitting can mitigate
transmission grid congestion and reduce redispatch costs. However, solving this
mixed-integer non-linear problem for large-scale systems in near-real-time is
currently intractable with existing solvers. Machine learning (ML) approaches
have emerged as a promising alternative, but they have limited generalization
to unseen topologies, varying operating conditions, and different systems,
which limits their practical applicability. This paper formulates NTO for
congestion management problem considering linearized AC PF, and proposes a
graph neural network (GNN)-accelerated approach. We develop a heterogeneous
edge-aware message passing NN to predict effective busbar splitting actions as
candidate NTO solutions. The proposed GNN captures local flow patterns,
achieves generalization to unseen topology changes, and improves
transferability across systems. Case studies show up to 4 orders-of-magnitude
speed-up, delivering AC-feasible solutions within one minute and a 2.3%
optimality gap on the GOC 2000-bus system. These results demonstrate a
significant step toward near-real-time NTO for large-scale systems with
topology and cross-system generalization.

TL;DR: 提出因果逐步评估(CaSE)方法，从相关性和连贯性两个维度评估LLM的推理质量，并通过基于CaSE筛选的训练数据提升最终任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前仅评估最终答案正确性的方法过于粗糙，无法反映底层推理过程的质量，需要更细粒度的评估来构建更鲁棒的模型。

Method: 将推理质量分解为相关性和连贯性两个维度，提出CaSE方法仅使用前序上下文评估每个推理步骤，避免后见之明偏差。

Result: 在MRa-GSM8K和MRa-MATH基准上验证CaSE与人工标注的一致性，并证明基于CaSE评估筛选的训练数据能直接提升最终任务性能。

Conclusion: CaSE提供了一个可扩展的框架来分析、调试和改进LLM推理，展示了超越有效性检查的实际价值。

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on final-answer correctness is the
dominant paradigm. This approach, however, provides a coarse signal for model
improvement and overlooks the quality of the underlying reasoning process. We
argue that a more granular evaluation of reasoning offers a more effective path
to building robust models. We decompose reasoning quality into two dimensions:
relevance and coherence. Relevance measures if a step is grounded in the
problem; coherence measures if it follows logically from prior steps. To
measure these aspects reliably, we introduce causal stepwise evaluation (CaSE).
This method assesses each reasoning step using only its preceding context,
which avoids hindsight bias. We validate CaSE against human judgments on our
new expert-annotated benchmarks, MRa-GSM8K and MRa-MATH. More importantly, we
show that curating training data with CaSE-evaluated relevance and coherence
directly improves final task performance. Our work provides a scalable
framework for analyzing, debugging, and improving LLM reasoning, demonstrating
the practical value of moving beyond validity checks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机游走中心性是图挖掘中量化节点重要性的基本指标，但现有方法计算成本高，难以应用于大规模网络。

Method: 1. 使用近似Cholesky分解和稀疏逆估计的方法；2. 基于采样根生成树的方法。两种方法都设计为在近线性时间内运行。

Result: 在大型真实网络（包括超过1000万个节点的网络）上的实验验证了所提算法的高效性和近似质量。

Conclusion: 提出的两种算法能够高效计算随机游走中心性，解决了大规模网络中的计算瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Random walk centrality is a fundamental metric in graph mining for
quantifying node importance and influence, defined as the weighted average of
hitting times to a node from all other nodes. Despite its ability to capture
rich graph structural information and its wide range of applications, computing
this measure for large networks remains impractical due to the computational
demands of existing methods. In this paper, we present a novel formulation of
random walk centrality, underpinning two scalable algorithms: one leveraging
approximate Cholesky factorization and sparse inverse estimation, while the
other sampling rooted spanning trees. Both algorithms operate in near-linear
time and provide strong approximation guarantees. Extensive experiments on
large real-world networks, including one with over 10 million nodes,
demonstrate the efficiency and approximation quality of the proposed
algorithms.

Abstract: Interpretable-by-design models are crucial for fostering trust,
accountability, and safe adoption of automated decision-making models in
real-world applications. In this paper we formalize the ground for the MIMOSA
(Mining Interpretable Models explOiting Sophisticated Algorithms) framework, a
comprehensive methodology for generating predictive models that balance
interpretability with performance while embedding key ethical properties. We
formally define here the supervised learning setting across diverse
decision-making tasks and data types, including tabular data, time series,
images, text, transactions, and trajectories. We characterize three major
families of interpretable models: feature importance, rule, and instance based
models. For each family, we analyze their interpretability dimensions,
reasoning mechanisms, and complexity. Beyond interpretability, we formalize
three critical ethical properties, namely causality, fairness, and privacy,
providing formal definitions, evaluation metrics, and verification procedures
for each. We then examine the inherent trade-offs between these properties and
discuss how privacy requirements, fairness constraints, and causal reasoning
can be embedded within interpretable pipelines. By evaluating ethical measures
during model generation, this framework establishes the theoretical foundations
for developing AI systems that are not only accurate and interpretable but also
fair, privacy-preserving, and causally aware, i.e., trustworthy.

TL;DR: EcomEval是一个全面的多语言多模态基准测试，用于评估LLM在电子商务领域的表现，解决了现有评估工具在任务多样性、模态覆盖、数据真实性和语言多样性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电子商务评估基准存在任务多样性有限（缺少产品指导和售后问题）、模态覆盖不全（缺乏多模态数据）、使用合成或精选数据、以及语言覆盖狭窄（主要限于英语和中文）等问题，无法可靠评估模型在复杂真实购物场景中的表现。

Method: 构建包含6个类别37个任务（包括8个多模态任务）的基准测试，数据主要来自真实客户查询和交易日志；采用半自动流程，由大模型生成候选回答，再由50多名具有电子商务和多语言专业知识的专家注释者审核修改；为每个问题和任务类别定义难度级别。

Result: EcomEval覆盖7种语言（包括5种东南亚低资源语言），提供了多语言视角；通过在不同规模和能力模型上的平均评估分数来定义难度级别，支持面向挑战的细粒度评估。

Conclusion: EcomEval填补了电子商务领域LLM评估的空白，为从业者提供了评估模型在复杂真实购物场景中表现的可靠工具，特别是在多语言和多模态方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel on general-purpose NLP benchmarks, yet
their capabilities in specialized domains remain underexplored. In e-commerce,
existing evaluations-such as EcomInstruct, ChineseEcomQA, eCeLLM, and Shopping
MMLU-suffer from limited task diversity (e.g., lacking product guidance and
after-sales issues), limited task modalities (e.g., absence of multimodal
data), synthetic or curated data, and a narrow focus on English and Chinese,
leaving practitioners without reliable tools to assess models on complex,
real-world shopping scenarios. We introduce EcomEval, a comprehensive
multilingual and multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs in e-commerce.
EcomEval covers six categories and 37 tasks (including 8 multimodal tasks),
sourced primarily from authentic customer queries and transaction logs,
reflecting the noisy and heterogeneous nature of real business interactions. To
ensure both quality and scalability of reference answers, we adopt a
semi-automatic pipeline in which large models draft candidate responses
subsequently reviewed and modified by over 50 expert annotators with strong
e-commerce and multilingual expertise. We define difficulty levels for each
question and task category by averaging evaluation scores across models with
different sizes and capabilities, enabling challenge-oriented and fine-grained
assessment. EcomEval also spans seven languages-including five low-resource
Southeast Asian languages-offering a multilingual perspective absent from prior
work.

Method: 通过测量模型理解、预测和调整扩展环境中状态变化的能力来评估适应性，关注上下文切换和连续性。

Result: 提出了Fluidity Index (FI)作为量化模型适应性的指标，并建立了相应的评估基准。

Conclusion: 真正超级智能的模型应至少具备二阶适应性，能够通过数字补充实现自我维持计算以达到最佳流动性。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Fluidity Index (FI) to quantify model adaptability
in dynamic, scaling environments. The benchmark evaluates response accuracy
based on deviations in initial, current, and future environment states,
assessing context switching and continuity. We distinguish between closed-ended
and open-ended benchmarks, prioritizing closed-loop open-ended real-world
benchmarks to test adaptability. The approach measures a model's ability to
understand, predict, and adjust to state changes in scaling environments. A
truly super-intelligent model should exhibit at least second-order
adaptability, enabling self-sustained computation through digital replenishment
for optimal fluidity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估大语言模型推理轨迹质量的方法依赖专家标注，劳动密集且不可靠，需要自动化、高效的评估方法。

Method: 采用拓扑数据分析方法捕捉推理轨迹的几何结构，提取紧凑稳定的拓扑特征来评估推理质量。

Result: 拓扑特征在评估推理质量方面比标准图指标具有显著更高的预测能力，表明有效推理由高维几何结构而非纯关系图更好捕获。

Conclusion: 拓扑特征为评估推理质量提供了可靠信号，可用于未来强化学习算法的实用指导。

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of reasoning traces from large language models remains
understudied, labor-intensive, and unreliable: current practice relies on
expert rubrics, manual annotation, and slow pairwise judgments. Automated
efforts are dominated by graph-based proxies that quantify structural
connectivity but do not clarify what constitutes high-quality reasoning; such
abstractions can be overly simplistic for inherently complex processes. We
introduce a topological data analysis (TDA)-based evaluation framework that
captures the geometry of reasoning traces and enables label-efficient,
automated assessment. In our empirical study, topological features yield
substantially higher predictive power for assessing reasoning quality than
standard graph metrics, suggesting that effective reasoning is better captured
by higher-dimensional geometric structures rather than purely relational
graphs. We further show that a compact, stable set of topological features
reliably indicates trace quality, offering a practical signal for future
reinforcement learning algorithms.

TL;DR: Graph-RFT是一个两阶段强化微调的KGQA框架，通过'计划-KG搜索-网络搜索-思考'范式，使LLM能够在知识不完整条件下自主规划和跨KG与网络源的自适应检索调度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KGQA方法难以充分利用KG中的丰富知识和LLM的推理能力，特别是在复杂场景中。它们通常假设KG覆盖完整，缺乏判断何时需要外部信息的机制，且推理过程缺乏连贯的多步规划。

Method: Graph-RFT采用两阶段方法：1) 使用定制化计划-检索数据集进行思维链微调，激活结构化推理；2) 引入计划-检索引导的强化学习过程，集成显式规划和检索动作，采用笛卡尔式规划模块分解复杂问题，使用逻辑表达式指导工具调用。

Result: 该方法通过多奖励设计优化推理检索过程，结合结果和检索特定信号，使模型能够学习何时以及如何有效结合KG和网络检索。

Conclusion: Graph-RFT框架解决了现有KGQA方法的局限性，实现了在不完整知识条件下的自主规划和自适应检索调度，提升了复杂场景下的推理能力。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering aims to answer natural language questions
by reasoning over structured knowledge graphs. While large language models have
advanced KGQA through their strong reasoning capabilities, existing methods
continue to struggle to fully exploit both the rich knowledge encoded in KGs
and the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly in complex scenarios. They
often assume complete KG coverage and lack mechanisms to judge when external
information is needed, and their reasoning remains locally myopic, failing to
maintain coherent multi-step planning, leading to reasoning failures even when
relevant knowledge exists. We propose Graph-RFT, a novel two-stage
reinforcement fine-tuning KGQA framework with a
'plan-KGsearch-and-Websearch-during-think' paradigm, that enables LLMs to
perform autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval scheduling across KG and web
sources under incomplete knowledge conditions. Graph-RFT introduces a
chain-of-thought fine-tuning method with a customized plan-retrieval dataset
activates structured reasoning and resolves the GRPO cold-start problem. It
then introduces a novel plan-retrieval guided reinforcement learning process
integrates explicit planning and retrieval actions with a multi-reward design,
enabling coverage-aware retrieval scheduling. It employs a Cartesian-inspired
planning module to decompose complex questions into ordered subquestions, and
logical expression to guide tool invocation for globally consistent multi-step
reasoning. This reasoning retrieval process is optimized with a multi-reward
combining outcome and retrieval specific signals, enabling the model to learn
when and how to combine KG and web retrieval effectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AGI定义基于算术平均值，假设各认知领域能力可相互补偿，但真正的通用智能应反映所有关键领域的平衡能力。

Method: 提出基于广义均值积分的一致性感知AGI度量方法，涵盖算术、几何和调和均值体系，通过AUC评估不同补偿性假设下的鲁棒性。

Result: 应用于GPT-4和GPT-5的CHC领域得分，一致性调整的AUC显示尽管算术得分较高（如GPT-5达24%），但两者距离通用能力仍很远。

Conclusion: 广义均值积分提供了一个原则性、可解释且更严格的AGI进展测量基础，能惩罚能力不平衡并捕捉领域间依赖关系。

Abstract: Recent work by \citet{hendrycks2025agidefinition} formalized
\textit{Artificial General Intelligence} (AGI) as the arithmetic mean of
proficiencies across cognitive domains derived from the Cattell--Horn--Carroll
(CHC) model of human cognition. While elegant, this definition assumes
\textit{compensability} -- that exceptional ability in some domains can offset
failure in others. True general intelligence, however, should reflect
\textit{coherent sufficiency}: balanced competence across all essential
domains. We propose a coherence-aware measure of AGI based on the integral of
generalized means over a continuum of compensability exponents. This
formulation spans arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic regimes, and the
resulting \textit{area under the curve} (AUC) quantifies robustness under
varying compensability assumptions. Unlike the arithmetic mean, which rewards
specialization, the AUC penalizes imbalance and captures inter-domain
dependency. Applied to published CHC-based domain scores for GPT-4 and GPT-5,
the coherence-adjusted AUC reveals that both systems remain far from general
competence despite high arithmetic scores (e.g., GPT-5 at~24\%). Integrating
the generalized mean thus yields a principled, interpretable, and stricter
foundation for measuring genuine progress toward AGI.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of research in AI and robotics now producing over
10,000 papers annually it has become increasingly difficult for researchers to
stay up to date. Fast evolving trends, the rise of interdisciplinary work, and
the need to explore domains beyond one's expertise all contribute to this
challenge. To address these issues, we propose a generalizable pipeline capable
of systematically analyzing any research area: identifying emerging trends,
uncovering cross domain opportunities, and offering concrete starting points
for new inquiry. In this work, we present Real Deep Research (RDR) a
comprehensive framework applied to the domains of AI and robotics, with a
particular focus on foundation models and robotics advancements. We also
briefly extend our analysis to other areas of science. The main paper details
the construction of the RDR pipeline, while the appendix provides extensive
results across each analyzed topic. We hope this work sheds light for
researchers working in the field of AI and beyond.
