### [2] [MaskCD: Mitigating LVLM Hallucinations by Image Head Masked Contrastive Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02790)
*Jingyuan Deng,Yujiu Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MaskCD方法，通过掩码LVLMs中的"图像头"来构建对比样本，有效缓解大视觉语言模型中的幻觉问题，同时保持模型的一般能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大视觉语言模型在视觉语言理解方面表现出色，但存在幻觉问题，即生成与输入视觉和文本内容相矛盾的内容。现有方法如对比解码和注意力操纵存在构建对比样本困难或稳定性不足的问题。

Method: 提出图像头掩码对比解码(MaskCD)，利用LVLMs中的"图像头"，通过掩码这些头来构建对比样本进行对比解码。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7b和Qwen-VL-7b上的评估显示，MaskCD在CHAIR、POPE、AMBER和MME等基准测试中有效缓解了幻觉现象，同时保持了LVLMs的一般能力。

Conclusion: MaskCD是一种有效缓解大视觉语言模型幻觉问题的方法，通过掩码图像头构建对比样本，在多个基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
visual-language understanding for downstream multimodal tasks. While their
capabilities are improving, problems emerge simultaneously. Among those
problems, the hallucinations have attracted much attention, which stands for
the phenomenon where LVLMs generate contradictory content to their input visual
and text contents. Many approaches have been proposed to deal with this issue,
such as contrastive decoding and attention manipulation. However, contrastive
decoding methods struggle in constructing appropriate contrastive samples, and
attention manipulation methods are highly sensitive, lacking stability. In this
work, we propose image head Masked Contrastive Decoding (MaskCD). Our approach
utilizes the "image heads" in LVLMs, masking them to construct contrastive
samples for contrastive decoding. We evaluated MaskCD on LLaVA-1.5-7b and
Qwen-VL-7b, using various benchmarks such as CHAIR, POPE, AMBER and MME. The
results demonstrate that MaskCD effectively alleviates the phenomenon of
hallucinations and retains the general capabilities of LVLMs. Corresponding

### [3] [Oracle-RLAIF: An Improved Fine-Tuning Framework for Multi-modal Video Models through Reinforcement Learning from Ranking Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02561)
*Derek Shi,Ruben Glatt,Christine Klymko,Shubham Mohole,Hongjun Choi,Shashank Kushwaha,Sam Sakla,Felipe Leno da Silva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Oracle-RLAIF框架，用通用的Oracle排序器替代训练奖励模型，结合新的基于排名的损失函数GRPO_rank，在视频理解任务上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视频语言模型参数规模扩大，收集人类反馈的成本增加。现有RLAIF框架依赖专门的奖励模型，流程昂贵且受限。

Method: 使用Oracle排序器对候选模型响应进行排序而非打分，提出基于GRPO的排名损失函数GRPO_rank，直接优化序数反馈。

Result: 在多个视频理解基准测试中，Oracle-RLAIF一致优于使用现有微调方法的领先视频语言模型。

Conclusion: Oracle-RLAIF为使用排名而非分数的强化学习对齐大型多模态视频模型提供了灵活且数据高效的框架。

Abstract: Recent advances in large video-language models (VLMs) rely on extensive
fine-tuning techniques that strengthen alignment between textual and visual
comprehension. Leading pipelines typically pair supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
with reinforcement learning from preference data to enhance video
comprehension. However, as VLMs scale in parameter size, so does the cost of
gathering enough human feedback. To make fine-tuning more cost-effective,
recent frameworks explore reinforcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF),
which replace human preference with AI as a judge. Current RLAIF frameworks
rely on a specialized reward model trained with video narratives to create
calibrated scalar rewards -- an expensive and restrictive pipeline. We propose
Oracle-RLAIF, a novel framework that replaces the trained reward model with a
more general Oracle ranker which acts as a drop-in model ranking candidate
model responses rather than scoring them. Alongside Oracle-RLAIF, we introduce
$GRPO_{rank}$, a novel rank-based loss function based on Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) that directly optimizes ordinal feedback with rank-aware
advantages. Empirically, we demonstrate that Oracle-RLAIF consistently
outperforms leading VLMs using existing fine-tuning methods when evaluated
across various video comprehension benchmarks. Oracle-RLAIF paves the path to
creating flexible and data-efficient frameworks for aligning large multi-modal
video models with reinforcement learning from rank rather than score.

### [4] [PhysHMR: Learning Humanoid Control Policies from Vision for Physically Plausible Human Motion Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02566)
*Qiao Feng,Yiming Huang,Yufu Wang,Jiatao Gu,Lingjie Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

Conclusion: 该框架通过统一学习视觉到动作策略，成功解决了单目视频中物理合理人体运动重建的挑战。

Abstract: Reconstructing physically plausible human motion from monocular videos
remains a challenging problem in computer vision and graphics. Existing methods
primarily focus on kinematics-based pose estimation, often leading to
unrealistic results due to the lack of physical constraints. To address such
artifacts, prior methods have typically relied on physics-based post-processing
following the initial kinematics-based motion estimation. However, this
two-stage design introduces error accumulation, ultimately limiting the overall
reconstruction quality. In this paper, we present PhysHMR, a unified framework
that directly learns a visual-to-action policy for humanoid control in a
physics-based simulator, enabling motion reconstruction that is both physically
grounded and visually aligned with the input video. A key component of our
approach is the pixel-as-ray strategy, which lifts 2D keypoints into 3D spatial
rays and transforms them into global space. These rays are incorporated as
policy inputs, providing robust global pose guidance without depending on noisy
3D root predictions. This soft global grounding, combined with local visual
features from a pretrained encoder, allows the policy to reason over both
detailed pose and global positioning. To overcome the sample inefficiency of
reinforcement learning, we further introduce a distillation scheme that
transfers motion knowledge from a mocap-trained expert to the
vision-conditioned policy, which is then refined using physically motivated
reinforcement learning rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhysHMR
produces high-fidelity, physically plausible motion across diverse scenarios,
outperforming prior approaches in both visual accuracy and physical realism.

### [5] [Unlocking the power of partnership: How humans and machines can work together to improve face recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02570)
*P. Jonathon Phillips,Geraldine Jeckeln,Carina A. Hahn,Amy N. Yates,Peter C. Fontana,Alice J. O'Toole*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了人机协作在面部识别中的效果，发现当人类和机器的基线准确率差异较小时，协作效果最佳（近端准确率规则）。通过智能融合策略，可以显著提升系统准确率，超越单独使用机器或简单融合所有判断的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是理解人机协作在面部识别决策中的效果，特别是在个体差异影响协作准确率的情况下，探索如何优化人机协作系统以提高识别准确率。

Method: 使用专家和非专家面部识别者的数据，分析人-人和人-机协作的效果。提出近端准确率规则（PAR），建立关键融合区域，并实施智能人机融合策略，选择能提升高性能机器准确率的人类参与者。

Result: 研究发现协作效益随协作者基线准确率差异减小而增加。智能融合比单独使用机器或简单融合所有判断更准确。人机协作能更有效地减少低表现人类对系统准确率的影响。

Conclusion: 研究证明了人类和机器在确保准确面部识别中都有重要作用，为人脸识别中AI的智能使用提供了基于证据的路线图。

Abstract: Human review of consequential decisions by face recognition algorithms
creates a "collaborative" human-machine system. Individual differences between
people and machines, however, affect whether collaboration improves or degrades
accuracy in any given case. We establish the circumstances under which
combining human and machine face identification decisions improves accuracy.
Using data from expert and non-expert face identifiers, we examined the
benefits of human-human and human-machine collaborations. The benefits of
collaboration increased as the difference in baseline accuracy between
collaborators decreased-following the Proximal Accuracy Rule (PAR). This rule
predicted collaborative (fusion) benefit across a wide range of baseline
abilities, from people with no training to those with extensive training. Using
the PAR, we established a critical fusion zone, where humans are less accurate
than the machine, but fusing the two improves system accuracy. This zone was
surprisingly large. We implemented "intelligent human-machine fusion" by
selecting people with the potential to increase the accuracy of a
high-performing machine. Intelligent fusion was more accurate than the machine
operating alone and more accurate than combining all human and machine
judgments. The highest system-wide accuracy achievable with human-only
partnerships was found by graph theory. This fully human system approximated
the average performance achieved by intelligent human-machine collaboration.
However, intelligent human-machine collaboration more effectively minimized the
impact of low-performing humans on system-wide accuracy. The results
demonstrate a meaningful role for both humans and machines in assuring accurate
face identification. This study offers an evidence-based road map for the
intelligent use of AI in face identification.

### [6] [How Confident are Video Models? Empowering Video Models to Express their Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02571)
*Zhiting Mei,Ola Shorinwa,Anirudha Majumdar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个视频生成模型不确定性量化框架S-QUBED，包含校准评估指标、黑盒UQ方法和基准数据集，能够分解预测不确定性为偶然性和认知性成分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频生成模型存在幻觉问题，会产生看似合理但事实错误的视频，但目前缺乏不确定性量化方法，存在严重的安全隐患。

Method: 提出S-QUBED框架：基于稳健秩相关估计的校准评估指标；利用潜在建模分解预测不确定性的黑盒UQ方法；用于基准测试的UQ数据集。

Result: 实验表明S-QUBED能计算校准的总不确定性估计，与任务准确度负相关，并能有效分解偶然性和认知性不确定性成分。

Conclusion: 这是首个针对视频生成模型的不确定性量化工作，S-QUBED框架为视频模型的安全部署提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Generative video models demonstrate impressive text-to-video capabilities,
spurring widespread adoption in many real-world applications. However, like
large language models (LLMs), video generation models tend to hallucinate,
producing plausible videos even when they are factually wrong. Although
uncertainty quantification (UQ) of LLMs has been extensively studied in prior
work, no UQ method for video models exists, raising critical safety concerns.
To our knowledge, this paper represents the first work towards quantifying the
uncertainty of video models. We present a framework for uncertainty
quantification of generative video models, consisting of: (i) a metric for
evaluating the calibration of video models based on robust rank correlation
estimation with no stringent modeling assumptions; (ii) a black-box UQ method
for video models (termed S-QUBED), which leverages latent modeling to
rigorously decompose predictive uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic
components; and (iii) a UQ dataset to facilitate benchmarking calibration in
video models. By conditioning the generation task in the latent space, we
disentangle uncertainty arising due to vague task specifications from that
arising from lack of knowledge. Through extensive experiments on benchmark
video datasets, we demonstrate that S-QUBED computes calibrated total
uncertainty estimates that are negatively correlated with the task accuracy and
effectively computes the aleatoric and epistemic constituents.

### [7] [PEO: Training-Free Aesthetic Quality Enhancement in Pre-Trained Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Prompt Embedding Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02599)
*Hovhannes Margaryan,Bo Wan,Tinne Tuytelaars*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Prompt Embedding Optimization (PEO)的新方法，通过优化文本嵌入来提升预训练文本到图像扩散模型生成图像的美学质量，无需额外训练且与主干模型无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对预训练文本到图像扩散模型在简单提示下生成图像美学质量不足的问题，希望通过优化文本嵌入来提升生成图像的视觉质量。

Method: 使用预训练文本到图像扩散模型作为主干，通过三重目标函数优化给定简单提示的文本嵌入：提升生成图像的美学保真度、确保与优化文本嵌入的一致性、以及通过提示保留项最小化与初始提示的差异。

Result: 定量和定性评估证实了该方法的有效性，在性能上超过或等同于最先进的文本到图像和提示适应方法。

Conclusion: PEO方法能够有效提升预训练扩散模型生成图像的美学质量，且具有无需训练和主干模型无关的优势。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to aesthetic quality improvement in
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models when given a simple prompt. Our
method, dubbed Prompt Embedding Optimization (PEO), leverages a pre-trained
text-to-image diffusion model as a backbone and optimizes the text embedding of
a given simple and uncurated prompt to enhance the visual quality of the
generated image. We achieve this by a tripartite objective function that
improves the aesthetic fidelity of the generated image, ensures adherence to
the optimized text embedding, and minimal divergence from the initial prompt.
The latter is accomplished through a prompt preservation term. Additionally,
PEO is training-free and backbone-independent. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, exceeding or
equating the performance of state-of-the-art text-to-image and prompt
adaptation methods.

### [8] [Ego-Exo 3D Hand Tracking in the Wild with a Mobile Multi-Camera Rig](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02601)
*Patrick Rim,Kun He,Kevin Harris,Braden Copple,Shangchen Han,Sizhe An,Ivan Shugurov,Tomas Hodan,He Wen,Xu Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型无标记多相机系统，用于在真实野外条件下捕获精确的3D手部和物体数据，解决了现有数据集环境多样性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手部追踪数据集主要在受控实验室环境中采集，限制了环境多样性和模型泛化能力，需要开发能在真实野外条件下工作的系统。

Method: 结合轻量级背戴式捕获装置（8个外中心相机）和Meta Quest 3头显（2个内中心视图），设计了自我-外部追踪流程来生成准确的3D手部姿态真值。

Result: 成功收集了包含同步多视角图像和精确3D手部姿态的标注数据集，显著减少了环境真实性与3D标注精度之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在真实野外条件下实现高精度的3D手部追踪，为无约束环境中的手部交互研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Accurate 3D tracking of hands and their interactions with the world in
unconstrained settings remains a significant challenge for egocentric computer
vision. With few exceptions, existing datasets are predominantly captured in
controlled lab setups, limiting environmental diversity and model
generalization. To address this, we introduce a novel marker-less multi-camera
system designed to capture precise 3D hands and objects, which allows for
nearly unconstrained mobility in genuinely in-the-wild conditions. We combine a
lightweight, back-mounted capture rig with eight exocentric cameras, and a
user-worn Meta Quest 3 headset, which contributes two egocentric views. We
design an ego-exo tracking pipeline to generate accurate 3D hand pose ground
truth from this system, and rigorously evaluate its quality. By collecting an
annotated dataset featuring synchronized multi-view images and precise 3D hand
poses, we demonstrate the capability of our approach to significantly reduce
the trade-off between environmental realism and 3D annotation accuracy.

### [9] [Input-Aware Sparse Attention for Real-Time Co-Speech Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02617)
*Beijia Lu,Ziyi Chen,Jing Xiao,Jun-Yan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的视频蒸馏方法，通过输入人体姿态条件来改进注意力机制和损失函数，实现从多步扩散模型到少步学生模型的蒸馏，达到实时性能并提升视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的语音驱动视频生成方法由于大量去噪步骤和昂贵的注意力机制而速度缓慢，无法实现实时部署。

Method: 使用输入人体姿态关键点的精确对应关系来引导注意力到相关区域（如人脸、手部和上半身），提出输入感知稀疏注意力减少冗余计算；引入输入感知蒸馏损失来改善唇部同步和手部运动真实性。

Result: 该方法实现了实时性能，相比最近的音频驱动和输入驱动方法具有更好的视觉质量。

Conclusion: 通过整合输入感知稀疏注意力和蒸馏损失，该方法在保持高质量的同时显著提升了推理效率，为实时语音驱动视频生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models can synthesize realistic co-speech video from audio for
various applications, such as video creation and virtual agents. However,
existing diffusion-based methods are slow due to numerous denoising steps and
costly attention mechanisms, preventing real-time deployment. In this work, we
distill a many-step diffusion video model into a few-step student model.
Unfortunately, directly applying recent diffusion distillation methods degrades
video quality and falls short of real-time performance. To address these
issues, our new video distillation method leverages input human pose
conditioning for both attention and loss functions. We first propose using
accurate correspondence between input human pose keypoints to guide attention
to relevant regions, such as the speaker's face, hands, and upper body. This
input-aware sparse attention reduces redundant computations and strengthens
temporal correspondences of body parts, improving inference efficiency and
motion coherence. To further enhance visual quality, we introduce an
input-aware distillation loss that improves lip synchronization and hand motion
realism. By integrating our input-aware sparse attention and distillation loss,
our method achieves real-time performance with improved visual quality compared
to recent audio-driven and input-driven methods. We also conduct extensive
experiments showing the effectiveness of our algorithmic design choices.

### [10] [Deep Generative Continual Learning using Functional LoRA: FunLoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02631)
*Victor Enescu,Hichem Sahbi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FunLoRA方法，通过使用秩1矩阵和精心选择的函数来增强矩阵秩，为生成模型设计更强大的条件机制，以解决持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度生成模型的持续适应具有巨大潜力，但增量训练面临灾难性遗忘的挑战。现有方法依赖合成数据进行再训练，存在训练时间不断增加和长期性能下降的问题。

Method: 基于低秩适应(LoRA)设计功能性LoRA(FunLoRA)，使用秩1矩阵并通过精心选择的函数增强矩阵秩，实现动态条件机制，使模型仅需在当前任务数据上训练。

Result: 在基于流匹配的模型上进行的广泛实验表明，FunLoRA超越了基于扩散模型的先前最先进结果，达到更高的分类准确率，同时只需要一小部分内存成本和采样时间。

Conclusion: FunLoRA是一种参数高效的微调方法，能够有效避免灾难性遗忘，在持续学习任务中表现出色，具有更好的性能和效率。

Abstract: Continual adaptation of deep generative models holds tremendous potential and
critical importance, given their rapid and expanding usage in text and vision
based applications. Incremental training, however, remains highly challenging
due to catastrophic forgetting phenomenon, which makes it difficult for neural
networks to effectively incorporate new knowledge. A common strategy consists
in retraining the generative model on its own synthetic data in order to
mitigate forgetting. Yet, such an approach faces two major limitations: (i) the
continually increasing training time eventually becomes intractable, and (ii)
reliance on synthetic data inevitably leads to long-term performance
degradation, since synthetic samples lack the richness of real training data.
In this paper, we attenuate these issues by designing a novel and more
expressive conditioning mechanism for generative models based on low rank
adaptation (LoRA), that exclusively employs rank 1 matrices, whose
reparametrized matrix rank is functionally increased using carefully selected
functions -- and dubbed functional LoRA: FunLoRA. Using this dynamic
conditioning, the generative model is guaranteed to avoid catastrophic
forgetting and needs only to be trained on data from the current task.
Extensive experiments using flow-matching based models trained from scratch,
showcase that our proposed parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method
surpasses prior state-of-the-art results based on diffusion models, reaching
higher classification accuracy scores, while only requiring a fraction of the
memory cost and sampling time.

*Abhishek Joshi,Jahnavi Krishna Koda,Abhishek Phadke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种双视野、序列保持的鲁棒性框架，用于美国交通灯和标志识别，结合特征压缩、防御蒸馏和基于熵的异常检测，在多种操作设计域下显著降低攻击成功率和风险误分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆中交通灯和标志识别错误直接影响导航和安全，现有模型对数字对抗攻击和自然扰动（眩光、雨水、污垢等）都缺乏鲁棒性，且缺乏时间连续性和多静态视野感知的考虑。

Method: 基于aiMotive、Udacity、Waymo和自采集德克萨斯州视频构建多源数据集，在高速公路、夜间、雨天和城市四种操作设计域下对RGB图像进行时间对齐。提出统一的三层防御堆栈框架，包含特征压缩、防御蒸馏、基于熵的异常检测，以及序列级时间投票增强。

Result: 统一防御堆栈实现了79.8mAP，将攻击成功率降低至18.2%，优于YOLOv8、YOLOv9和BEVFormer，同时将高风险误分类降低至32%。通过重捕获探针确认了物理可转移性。

Conclusion: 该框架在多种现实条件下显著提升了交通灯和标志识别的鲁棒性，为自动驾驶系统的安全感知提供了有效的防御解决方案。

Abstract: Traffic light and sign recognition are key for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs)
because perception mistakes directly influence navigation and safety. In
addition to digital adversarial attacks, models are vulnerable to existing
perturbations (glare, rain, dirt, or graffiti), which could lead to dangerous
misclassifications. The current work lacks consideration of temporal
continuity, multistatic field-of-view (FoV) sensing, and robustness to both
digital and natural degradation. This study proposes a dual FoV,
sequence-preserving robustness framework for traffic lights and signs in the
USA based on a multi-source dataset built on aiMotive, Udacity, Waymo, and
self-recorded videos from the region of Texas. Mid and long-term sequences of
RGB images are temporally aligned for four operational design domains (ODDs):
highway, night, rainy, and urban. Over a series of experiments on a real-life
application of anomaly detection, this study outlines a unified three-layer
defense stack framework that incorporates feature squeezing, defensive
distillation, and entropy-based anomaly detection, as well as sequence-wise
temporal voting for further enhancement. The evaluation measures included
accuracy, attack success rate (ASR), risk-weighted misclassification severity,
and confidence stability. Physical transferability was confirmed using probes
for recapture. The results showed that the Unified Defense Stack achieved
79.8mAP and reduced the ASR to 18.2%, which is superior to YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and
BEVFormer, while reducing the high-risk misclassification to 32%.

*Benjamin Yu,Jackie Liu,Justin Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Smart-GRPO是首个针对流匹配模型中强化学习优化噪声扰动的方法，通过迭代搜索策略改进噪声分布，提高奖励优化和视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流匹配模型的确定性特性使其不适合强化学习，而现有方法通过随机噪声扰动效率低且不稳定。

Method: 采用迭代搜索策略：解码候选扰动、用奖励函数评估、向高奖励区域优化噪声分布。

Result: 实验表明Smart-GRPO在奖励优化和视觉质量方面均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 为流匹配框架中的强化学习提供了实用路径，弥合了高效训练与人类对齐生成之间的差距。

Abstract: Recent advancements in flow-matching have enabled high-quality text-to-image
generation. However, the deterministic nature of flow-matching models makes
them poorly suited for reinforcement learning, a key tool for improving image
quality and human alignment. Prior work has introduced stochasticity by
perturbing latents with random noise, but such perturbations are inefficient
and unstable. We propose Smart-GRPO, the first method to optimize noise
perturbations for reinforcement learning in flow-matching models. Smart-GRPO
employs an iterative search strategy that decodes candidate perturbations,
evaluates them with a reward function, and refines the noise distribution
toward higher-reward regions. Experiments demonstrate that Smart-GRPO improves
both reward optimization and visual quality compared to baseline methods. Our
results suggest a practical path toward reinforcement learning in flow-matching
frameworks, bridging the gap between efficient training and human-aligned
generation.

*Yibin Zhao,Yihan Pan,Jun Nan,Jianjun Yi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FSFSplatter是一种从自由稀疏图像进行快速表面重建的新方法，通过端到端密集高斯初始化、相机参数估计和几何增强场景优化，解决了传统方法需要密集校准视图的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高斯溅射方法大多需要密集、校准的视图，而从自由稀疏图像重建往往由于有限重叠和过拟合导致表面质量差。

Method: 使用大型Transformer编码多视图图像，通过自分裂高斯头生成密集且几何一致的高斯场景初始化，采用基于贡献的剪枝消除局部漂浮物，并在快速优化期间利用深度和多视图特征监督与可微相机参数来缓解过拟合。

Result: FSFSplatter在广泛使用的DTU和Replica数据集上优于当前最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够从自由稀疏图像实现高质量的表面重建，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has become a leading reconstruction technique, known for
its high-quality novel view synthesis and detailed reconstruction. However,
most existing methods require dense, calibrated views. Reconstructing from free
sparse images often leads to poor surface due to limited overlap and
overfitting. We introduce FSFSplatter, a new approach for fast surface
reconstruction from free sparse images. Our method integrates end-to-end dense
Gaussian initialization, camera parameter estimation, and geometry-enhanced
scene optimization. Specifically, FSFSplatter employs a large Transformer to
encode multi-view images and generates a dense and geometrically consistent
Gaussian scene initialization via a self-splitting Gaussian head. It eliminates
local floaters through contribution-based pruning and mitigates overfitting to
limited views by leveraging depth and multi-view feature supervision with
differentiable camera parameters during rapid optimization. FSFSplatter
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on widely used DTU and Replica.

Conclusion: MoGIC框架推进了可控运动合成和意图理解，为多模态运动生成提供了更强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing text-driven motion generation methods often treat synthesis as a
bidirectional mapping between language and motion, but remain limited in
capturing the causal logic of action execution and the human intentions that
drive behavior. The absence of visual grounding further restricts precision and
personalization, as language alone cannot specify fine-grained spatiotemporal
details. We propose MoGIC, a unified framework that integrates intention
modeling and visual priors into multimodal motion synthesis. By jointly
optimizing multimodal-conditioned motion generation and intention prediction,
MoGIC uncovers latent human goals, leverages visual priors to enhance
generation, and exhibits versatile multimodal generative capability. We further
introduce a mixture-of-attention mechanism with adaptive scope to enable
effective local alignment between conditional tokens and motion subsequences.
To support this paradigm, we curate Mo440H, a 440-hour benchmark from 21
high-quality motion datasets. Experiments show that after finetuning, MoGIC
reduces FID by 38.6\% on HumanML3D and 34.6\% on Mo440H, surpasses LLM-based
methods in motion captioning with a lightweight text head, and further enables
intention prediction and vision-conditioned generation, advancing controllable
motion synthesis and intention understanding. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种运动自适应的3D重建框架，通过运动感知压缩将控制点集中在动态区域，减少静态背景冗余，并使用样条轨迹参数化实现更平滑的运动表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏控制方法仅基于几何分配控制点，导致静态区域冗余和动态区域不足，无法有效匹配运动复杂度。

Method: 利用视觉基础模型的语义和运动先验建立对应关系，通过迭代体素化和运动趋势评分实现运动自适应压缩，采用样条轨迹参数化替代MLP变形场。

Result: 在重建质量和效率上相比现有最先进方法有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该框架通过运动自适应控制点分配和样条轨迹参数化，有效解决了控制点分配与运动复杂度不匹配的问题。

Abstract: Dynamic 3D reconstruction from monocular videos remains difficult due to the
ambiguity inferring 3D motion from limited views and computational demands of
modeling temporally varying scenes. While recent sparse control methods
alleviate computation by reducing millions of Gaussians to thousands of control
points, they suffer from a critical limitation: they allocate points purely by
geometry, leading to static redundancy and dynamic insufficiency. We propose a
motion-adaptive framework that aligns control density with motion complexity.
Leveraging semantic and motion priors from vision foundation models, we
establish patch-token-node correspondences and apply motion-adaptive
compression to concentrate control points in dynamic regions while suppressing
redundancy in static backgrounds. Our approach achieves flexible
representational density adaptation through iterative voxelization and motion
tendency scoring, directly addressing the fundamental mismatch between control
point allocation and motion complexity. To capture temporal evolution, we
introduce spline-based trajectory parameterization initialized by 2D tracklets,
replacing MLP-based deformation fields to achieve smoother motion
representation and more stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in reconstruction quality and efficiency over existing
state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统去噪方法依赖手工先验，在复杂真实噪声中表现不佳；深度学习需要大量标注数据且泛化能力有限。需要一种能结合两者优势的方法来处理真实世界噪声。

Method: 结合无监督DIP网络和预训练DRUNet模型，通过正则化去噪(RED)技术整合。未训练网络适应输入图像的独特噪声特征，预训练网络利用大规模数据集学习到的表示。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在真实世界噪声去除方面表现优越，特别是在训练数据有限的情况下。

Conclusion: Net2Net框架通过结合未训练和预训练网络的混合方法，有效提升了噪声去除的泛化能力和性能，特别适用于真实世界噪声场景。

Abstract: Traditional denoising methods for noise removal have largely relied on
handcrafted priors, often perform well in controlled environments but struggle
to address the complexity and variability of real noise. In contrast, deep
learning-based approaches have gained prominence for learning noise
characteristics from large datasets, but these methods frequently require
extensive labeled data and may not generalize effectively across diverse noise
types and imaging conditions. In this paper, we present an innovative method,
termed as Net2Net, that combines the strengths of untrained and pre-trained
networks to tackle the challenges of real-world noise removal. The innovation
of Net2Net lies in its combination of unsupervised DIP and supervised
pre-trained model DRUNet by regularization by denoising (RED). The untrained
network adapts to the unique noise characteristics of each input image without
requiring labeled data, while the pre-trained network leverages learned
representations from large-scale datasets to deliver robust denoising
performance. This hybrid framework enhances generalization across varying noise
patterns and improves performance, particularly in scenarios with limited
training data. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our method for real-world noise removal.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Retrv-R1是首个专为多模态通用检索设计的R1风格MLLM，通过逐步推理提升检索准确性，解决了DeepSeek-R1直接应用于检索任务时的高计算成本和训练不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DeepSeek-R1展示了强化学习增强LLM推理能力的潜力，但直接将其方法应用于检索任务不可行，主要因为多候选推理过程导致的高计算成本，以及直接应用RL训练检索任务的不稳定性和次优结果。

Method: 引入信息压缩模块和细节检查机制减少token数量同时保留关键信息；提出新的训练范式，包括使用检索定制合成CoT数据集的激活阶段，以及采用课程奖励的RL训练。

Result: Retrv-R1在多个基准测试和任务中实现了SOTA性能、高效率和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过信息压缩和新的训练范式，Retrv-R1成功解决了R1风格模型在检索任务中的应用挑战，为多模态通用检索提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: The success of DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates the immense potential of using
reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities. This paper
introduces Retrv-R1, the first R1-style MLLM specifically designed for
multimodal universal retrieval, achieving higher performance by employing
step-by-step reasoning to produce more accurate retrieval results. We find that
directly applying the methods of DeepSeek-R1 to retrieval tasks is not
feasible, mainly due to (1) the high computational cost caused by the large
token consumption required for multiple candidates with reasoning processes,
and (2) the instability and suboptimal results when directly applying RL to
train for retrieval tasks. To address these issues, Retrv-R1 introduces an
information compression module with a details inspection mechanism, which
enhances computational efficiency by reducing the number of tokens while
ensuring that critical information for challenging candidates is preserved.
Furthermore, a new training paradigm is proposed, including an activation stage
using a retrieval-tailored synthetic CoT dataset for more effective
optimization, followed by RL with a novel curriculum reward to improve both
performance and efficiency. Incorporating these novel designs, Retrv-R1
achieves SOTA performance, high efficiency, and strong generalization ability,
as demonstrated by experiments across multiple benchmarks and tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法要么依赖计算昂贵的反向传播，要么只关注似然适应而忽略先验的重要性，无法满足实时部署需求。

Method: 引入动态缓存机制，自适应存储和更新类别嵌入、空间尺度（用于检测）以及基于历史预测的自适应类别先验，将自适应建模为贝叶斯推理问题。

Result: 在识别和检测基准测试中达到最先进性能，且作为无需训练的方法具有高计算效率。

Conclusion: BCA+通过结合动态更新的似然和先验，以及不确定性指导的融合机制，有效提升了视觉语言模型在真实世界分布偏移下的性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP and Grounding DINO have achieved
remarkable success in object recognition and detection. However, their
performance often degrades under real-world distribution shifts. Test-time
adaptation (TTA) aims to mitigate this issue by adapting models during
inference. Existing methods either rely on computationally expensive
backpropagation, which hinders real-time deployment, or focus solely on
likelihood adaptation, which overlooks the critical role of the prior. Our
prior work, Bayesian Class Adaptation (BCA), addressed these shortcomings for
object recognition by introducing a training-free framework that incorporates
adaptive priors. Building upon this foundation, we now present Bayesian Class
Adaptation plus (BCA+), a unified, training-free framework for TTA for both
object recognition and detection. BCA+ introduces a dynamic cache that
adaptively stores and updates class embeddings, spatial scales (for detection),
and, crucially, adaptive class priors derived from historical predictions. We
formulate adaptation as a Bayesian inference problem, where final predictions
are generated by fusing the initial VLM output with a cache-based prediction.
This cache-based prediction combines a dynamically updated likelihood
(measuring feature and scale similarity) and a prior (reflecting the evolving
class distribution). This dual-adaptation mechanism, coupled with
uncertainty-guided fusion, enables BCA+ to correct both the model's semantic
understanding and its contextual confidence. As a training-free method
requiring no backpropagation, BCA+ is highly efficient. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BCA+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on both recognition
and detection benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于脑肿瘤分类的层次化广义类别发现方法（HGCD-BT），通过结合层次聚类和对比学习，能够识别训练时未见过的肿瘤类别，在OpenSRH数据集上比现有GCD方法准确率提升28%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有脑肿瘤分类方法局限于预定义的固定类别，无法识别训练时未见的肿瘤类型。无监督学习缺乏利用标记数据先验知识的能力，而半监督方法假设所有潜在类别都在标记数据中。需要一种能同时分类已知和未知类别的方法。

Method: HGCD-BT方法将层次聚类与对比学习相结合，在基于对比学习的GCD基础上引入了新的半监督层次聚类损失函数，能够捕捉脑肿瘤分类学的层次结构。

Result: 在OpenSRH数据集上，HGCD-BT在斑块级分类中比最先进的GCD方法准确率提升28%，特别是在识别未见过的肿瘤类别方面表现优异。在Digital Brain Tumor Atlas的玻片级分类中也验证了方法的通用性。

Conclusion: HGCD-BT是一种有效的脑肿瘤分类方法，能够识别已知和未知的肿瘤类别，具有跨成像模态的通用性，为神经肿瘤手术中的术中决策提供了更好的支持。

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor classification is critical for intra-operative decision
making in neuro-oncological surgery. However, existing approaches are
restricted to a fixed set of predefined classes and are therefore unable to
capture patterns of tumor types not available during training. Unsupervised
learning can extract general-purpose features, but it lacks the ability to
incorporate prior knowledge from labelled data, and semi-supervised methods
often assume that all potential classes are represented in the labelled data.
Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to bridge this gap by categorizing
both known and unknown classes within unlabelled data. To reflect the
hierarchical structure of brain tumor taxonomies, in this work, we introduce
Hierarchical Generalized Category Discovery for Brain Tumor Classification
(HGCD-BT), a novel approach that integrates hierarchical clustering with
contrastive learning. Our method extends contrastive learning based GCD by
incorporating a novel semi-supervised hierarchical clustering loss. We evaluate
HGCD-BT on OpenSRH, a dataset of stimulated Raman histology brain tumor images,
achieving a +28% improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art GCD methods for
patch-level classification, particularly in identifying previously unseen tumor
categories. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of HGCD-BT on
slide-level classification of hematoxylin and eosin stained whole-slide images
from the Digital Brain Tumor Atlas, confirming its utility across imaging
modalities.

TL;DR: AdaRD-Key是一个无需训练的关键帧采样模块，通过最大化统一的相关性-多样性目标，为长视频理解提供信息丰富且非冗余的帧选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型依赖均匀采样，常忽略关键时刻；而关键帧选择方法要么采用刚性时间间隔导致错过精细线索，要么强调视觉多样性但忽视查询相关性。

Method: 提出最大化相关性-多样性最大体积目标，结合查询条件相关性评分和对数行列式多样性组件，并采用轻量级相关性感知门控机制处理弱对齐查询。

Result: 在LongVideoBench和Video-MME上的广泛实验展示了最先进的性能，特别是在长视频上表现优异。

Conclusion: AdaRD-Key是一个无需训练、计算高效且即插即用的解决方案，显著提升了长视频理解能力。

Abstract: Understanding long-form videos remains a significant challenge for
vision--language models (VLMs) due to their extensive temporal length and high
information density. Most current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely
on uniform sampling, which often overlooks critical moments, leading to
incorrect responses to queries. In parallel, many keyframe selection approaches
impose rigid temporal spacing: once a frame is chosen, an exclusion window
suppresses adjacent timestamps to reduce redundancy. While effective at
limiting overlap, this strategy frequently misses short, fine-grained cues near
important events. Other methods instead emphasize visual diversity but neglect
query relevance. We propose AdaRD-Key, a training-free keyframe sampling module
for query-driven long-form video understanding. AdaRD-Key maximizes a unified
Relevance--Diversity Max-Volume (RD-MV) objective, combining a
query-conditioned relevance score with a log-determinant diversity component to
yield informative yet non-redundant frames. To handle broad queries with weak
alignment to the video, AdaRD-Key employs a lightweight relevance-aware gating
mechanism; when the relevance distribution indicates weak alignment, the method
seamlessly shifts into a diversity-only mode, enhancing coverage without
additional supervision. Our pipeline is training-free, computationally
efficient (running in real time on a single GPU), and compatible with existing
VLMs in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments on LongVideoBench and
Video-MME demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, particularly on long-form
videos. Code available at https://github.com/Xian867/AdaRD-Key.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现出色，但它们在复杂横向思维挑战（如字谜谜题）上的认知过程仍然不透明，且现有研究主要关注性能指标而非底层推理过程。

Method: 创建了包含221个字谜的系统标注数据集，涵盖六个认知类别；开发了将推理质量与答案正确性分离的评估框架；研究了三种提示策略以引出不同类型的解释过程。

Result: 发现推理质量在不同谜题类别中差异显著，模型在视觉组合方面表现出系统性优势，但在缺失解释和文化象征方面存在基本限制；提示策略显著影响认知方法和问题解决效果。

Conclusion: 可解释性应被视为模型性能的组成部分而非事后考虑，提示策略对认知过程和问题解决效果有重要影响。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet their
cognitive processes remain opaque on complex lateral thinking challenges like
rebus puzzles. While recent work has demonstrated these models struggle
significantly with rebus puzzle solving, the underlying reasoning processes and
failure patterns remain largely unexplored. We address this gap through a
comprehensive explainability analysis that moves beyond performance metrics to
understand how VLMs approach these complex lateral thinking challenges. Our
study contributes a systematically annotated dataset of 221 rebus puzzles
across six cognitive categories, paired with an evaluation framework that
separates reasoning quality from answer correctness. We investigate three
prompting strategies designed to elicit different types of explanatory
processes and reveal critical insights into VLM cognitive processes. Our
findings demonstrate that reasoning quality varies dramatically across puzzle
categories, with models showing systematic strengths in visual composition
while exhibiting fundamental limitations in absence interpretation and cultural
symbolism. We also discover that prompting strategy substantially influences
both cognitive approach and problem-solving effectiveness, establishing
explainability as an integral component of model performance rather than a
post-hoc consideration.

Conclusion: 提出的数据集合成方法解决了现有文本移除基准的局限性，为文本移除任务提供了更准确和具有挑战性的评估标准。

Abstract: Text removal is a crucial task in computer vision with applications such as
privacy preservation, image editing, and media reuse. While existing research
has primarily focused on scene text removal in natural images, limitations in
current datasets hinder out-of-domain generalization or accurate evaluation. In
particular, widely used benchmarks such as SCUT-EnsText suffer from ground
truth artifacts due to manual editing, overly simplistic text backgrounds, and
evaluation metrics that do not capture the quality of generated results. To
address these issues, we introduce an approach to synthesizing a text removal
benchmark applicable to domains other than scene texts. Our dataset features
text rendered on complex backgrounds using object-aware placement and
vision-language model-generated content, ensuring clean ground truth and
challenging text removal scenarios. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于多模态医学目标检测的表示对齐方法，通过模态令牌和查询表示对齐来改善混合模态训练的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单一检测器在混合医学模态（如CXR、CT、MRI）上训练时，由于统计异质性和表示空间不连续导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 使用模态令牌编码成像模态信息，通过多模态上下文注意力（MoCA）将模态上下文传播到对象查询中，并引入QueryREPA预训练阶段进行查询表示对齐。

Result: 该方法在多种模态联合训练时能持续提高AP性能，且开销最小，无需架构修改。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建鲁棒的多模态医学目标检测提供了一条实用路径。

Abstract: Medical object detection suffers when a single detector is trained on mixed
medical modalities (e.g., CXR, CT, MRI) due to heterogeneous statistics and
disjoint representation spaces. To address this challenge, we turn to
representation alignment, an approach that has proven effective for bringing
features from different sources into a shared space. Specifically, we target
the representations of DETR-style object queries and propose a simple,
detector-agnostic framework to align them with modality context. First, we
define modality tokens: compact, text-derived embeddings encoding imaging
modality that are lightweight and require no extra annotations. We integrate
the modality tokens into the detection process via Multimodality Context
Attention (MoCA), mixing object-query representations via self-attention to
propagate modality context within the query set. This preserves DETR-style
architectures and adds negligible latency while injecting modality cues into
object queries. We further introduce QueryREPA, a short pretraining stage that
aligns query representations to their modality tokens using a task-specific
contrastive objective with modality-balanced batches. Together, MoCA and
QueryREPA produce modality-aware, class-faithful queries that transfer
effectively to downstream training. Across diverse modalities trained
altogether, the proposed approach consistently improves AP with minimal
overhead and no architectural modifications, offering a practical path toward
robust multimodality medical object detection. Project page:

Abstract: Pose estimation is still a challenge at the small scales. Few solutions exist
to capture the 6 degrees of freedom of an object with nanometric and
microradians resolutions over relatively large ranges. Over the years, we have
proposed several fiducial marker and pattern designs to achieve reliable
performance for various microscopy applications. Centimeter ranges are possible
using pattern encoding methods, while nanometer resolutions can be achieved
using phase processing of the periodic frames. This paper presents VERNIER, an
open source phase processing software designed to provide fast and reliable
pose measurement based on pseudo-periodic patterns. Thanks to a phase-based
local thresholding algorithm, the software has proven to be particularly robust
to noise, defocus and occlusion. The successive steps of the phase processing
are presented, as well as the different types of patterns that address
different application needs. The implementation procedure is illustrated with
synthetic and experimental images. Finally, guidelines are given for selecting
the appropriate pattern design and microscope magnification lenses as a
function of the desired performance.

Motivation: 临床诊断需要灵活的重建缺失成像模态，但现有方法面临三个挑战：如何建模不同模态对目标任务的异质贡献、如何控制融合质量防止噪声信息退化、如何在多输出生成中保持模态身份一致性。

Method: 将多模态医学数据视为具有质量驱动选择机制的序列帧，设计三个协作模块：PreWeightNet用于全局贡献评估，ThresholdNet用于自适应过滤，EffiWeightNet用于有效权重计算，并提出因果模态身份模块(CMIM)来保持模态一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过自适应权重学习和渐进式增强有效解决了K到N医学图像合成的关键挑战，为临床诊断提供了可靠的多模态重建解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-modal medical image synthesis research focuses on reconstructing
missing imaging modalities from available ones to support clinical diagnosis.
Driven by clinical necessities for flexible modality reconstruction, we explore
K to N medical generation, where three critical challenges emerge: How can we
model the heterogeneous contributions of different modalities to various target
tasks? How can we ensure fusion quality control to prevent degradation from
noisy information? How can we maintain modality identity consistency in
multi-output generation? Driven by these clinical necessities, and drawing
inspiration from SAM2's sequential frame paradigm and clinicians' progressive
workflow of incrementally adding and selectively integrating multi-modal
information, we treat multi-modal medical data as sequential frames with
quality-driven selection mechanisms. Our key idea is to "learn" adaptive
weights for each modality-task pair and "memorize" beneficial fusion patterns
through progressive enhancement. To achieve this, we design three collaborative
modules: PreWeightNet for global contribution assessment, ThresholdNet for
adaptive filtering, and EffiWeightNet for effective weight computation.
Meanwhile, to maintain modality identity consistency, we propose the Causal
Modality Identity Module (CMIM) that establishes causal constraints between
generated images and target modality descriptions using vision-language
modeling. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Med-K2N
outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins on multiple
benchmarks. Source code is available.

Motivation: 需要开发准确、非破坏性的鸡蛋质量评估方法，以确保食品安全、维持产品标准和提高商业家禽生产效率。

Method: 使用预训练CNN模型提取图像特征，结合形状和重量特征，采用PCA降维、SMOTE增强和多种机器学习算法，最后通过集成投票机制提升分类精度。

Abstract: Accurate, non-destructive assessment of egg quality is critical for ensuring
food safety, maintaining product standards, and operational efficiency in
commercial poultry production. This paper introduces ELMF4EggQ, an ensemble
learning framework that employs multimodal feature fusion to classify egg grade
and freshness using only external attributes - image, shape, and weight. A
novel, publicly available dataset of 186 brown-shelled eggs was constructed,
with egg grade and freshness levels determined through laboratory-based expert
assessments involving internal quality measurements, such as yolk index and
Haugh unit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply
machine learning methods for internal egg quality assessment using only
external, non-invasive features, and the first to release a corresponding
labeled dataset. The proposed framework integrates deep features extracted from
external egg images with structural characteristics such as egg shape and
weight, enabling a comprehensive representation of each egg. Image feature
extraction is performed using top-performing pre-trained CNN models (ResNet152,
DenseNet169, and ResNet152V2), followed by PCA-based dimensionality reduction,
SMOTE augmentation, and classification using multiple machine learning
algorithms. An ensemble voting mechanism combines predictions from the
best-performing classifiers to enhance overall accuracy. Experimental results
demonstrate that the multimodal approach significantly outperforms image-only
and tabular (shape and weight) only baselines, with the multimodal ensemble
approach achieving 86.57% accuracy in grade classification and 70.83% in
freshness prediction. All code and data are publicly available at

representations and whole-image captions. We present \frameworkName{}, a
unified framework for zero-shot captioning that shifts from an image-centric to
a patch-centric paradigm, enabling the captioning of arbitrary regions without
the need of region-level supervision. Instead of relying on global image
representations, we treat individual patches as atomic captioning units and
aggregate them to describe arbitrary regions, from single patches to
non-contiguous areas and entire images. We analyze the key ingredients that
enable current latent captioners to work in our novel proposed framework.
Experiments demonstrate that backbones producing meaningful, dense visual
features, such as DINO, are key to achieving state-of-the-art performance in
multiple region-based captioning tasks. Compared to other baselines and
state-of-the-art competitors, our models achieve better performance on
zero-shot dense, region-set, and a newly introduced trace captioning task,
highlighting the effectiveness of patch-wise semantic representations for
scalable caption generation. Project page at https://paciosoft.com/Patch-ioner/ .

### [28] [Representation Learning for Compressed Video Action Recognition via Attentive Cross-modal Interaction with Motion Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03569)
*Bing Li,Jiaxin Chen,Dongming Zhang,Xiuguo Bao,Di Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MEACI-Net框架，通过多尺度去噪模块增强运动表示，并引入选择性运动补充和跨模态增强模块来加强RGB与运动模态的交互，提升压缩视频动作识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 压缩视频动作识别面临动态信息粗糙噪声大、RGB与运动模态融合不足的问题，需要改进表示学习和模态交互。

Method: 采用双流架构，运动流使用多尺度去噪模块增强表示，通过选择性运动补充(SMC)和跨模态增强(CMA)模块加强模态交互。

Result: 在UCF-101、HMDB-51和Kinetics-400基准测试上验证了方法的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: MEACI-Net通过运动增强和跨模态交互机制，有效解决了压缩视频动作识别中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Compressed video action recognition has recently drawn growing attention,
since it remarkably reduces the storage and computational cost via replacing
raw videos by sparsely sampled RGB frames and compressed motion cues (e.g.,
motion vectors and residuals). However, this task severely suffers from the
coarse and noisy dynamics and the insufficient fusion of the heterogeneous RGB
and motion modalities. To address the two issues above, this paper proposes a
novel framework, namely Attentive Cross-modal Interaction Network with Motion
Enhancement (MEACI-Net). It follows the two-stream architecture, i.e. one for
the RGB modality and the other for the motion modality. Particularly, the
motion stream employs a multi-scale block embedded with a denoising module to
enhance representation learning. The interaction between the two streams is
then strengthened by introducing the Selective Motion Complement (SMC) and
Cross-Modality Augment (CMA) modules, where SMC complements the RGB modality
with spatio-temporally attentive local motion features and CMA further combines
the two modalities with selective feature augmentation. Extensive experiments
on the UCF-101, HMDB-51 and Kinetics-400 benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of MEACI-Net.

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的方法，利用InternImage骨干网络特征，结合K-Means聚类和置信度阈值来检测语义分割中的分布外区域，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索基础模型在语义分割中检测分布外区域的能力，这对于自动驾驶等安全关键应用至关重要。

Method: 使用InternImage骨干网络提取特征，应用K-Means聚类和原始解码器logits的置信度阈值来识别分布外聚类。

Result: 在RoadAnomaly基准测试上达到50.02平均精度，在ADE-OoD基准测试上达到48.77平均精度，超过多个有监督和无监督基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为需要最少假设或额外数据的通用分布外分割方法提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Detecting unknown objects in semantic segmentation is crucial for
safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Large vision
foundation models, including DINOv2, InternImage, and CLIP, have advanced
visual representation learning by providing rich features that generalize well
across diverse tasks. While their strength in closed-set semantic tasks is
established, their capability to detect out-of-distribution (OoD) regions in
semantic segmentation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate
whether foundation models fine-tuned on segmentation datasets can inherently
distinguish in-distribution (ID) from OoD regions without any outlier
supervision. We propose a simple, training-free approach that utilizes features
from the InternImage backbone and applies K-Means clustering alongside
confidence thresholding on raw decoder logits to identify OoD clusters. Our
method achieves 50.02 Average Precision on the RoadAnomaly benchmark and 48.77
on the benchmark of ADE-OoD with InternImage-L, surpassing several supervised
and unsupervised baselines. These results suggest a promising direction for
generic OoD segmentation methods that require minimal assumptions or additional
data.

*Xin Zou,Di Lu,Yizhou Wang,Yibo Yan,Yuanhuiyi Lyu,Xu Zheng,Linfeng Zhang,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HoloV是一个简单有效的视觉token剪枝框架，通过从全局视角自适应分配剪枝预算来保留关键视觉信息，解决了现有基于注意力的剪枝方法在高剪枝率下性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型依赖大量视觉token导致计算开销巨大，现有基于注意力的剪枝方法在高剪枝率下会保留语义相似的token，造成性能显著下降。

Method: 提出HoloV框架，从整体视角重新思考token保留策略，通过自适应分配不同空间裁剪的剪枝预算，确保保留的token能够捕捉全局视觉上下文而非孤立显著特征。

Result: 实验表明HoloV在各种任务、MLLM架构和剪枝率下均优于现有方法，例如LLaVA1.5在剪枝88.9%视觉token后仍保持95.8%的原始性能。

Conclusion: HoloV通过整体视角的token剪枝策略，在高效推理和准确性之间取得了优越的平衡，是一个即插即用的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite their powerful capabilities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
suffer from considerable computational overhead due to their reliance on
massive visual tokens. Recent studies have explored token pruning to alleviate
this problem, which typically uses text-vision cross-attention or
[\texttt{CLS}] attention to assess and discard redundant visual tokens. In this
work, we identify a critical limitation of such attention-first pruning
approaches, i.e., they tend to preserve semantically similar tokens, resulting
in pronounced performance drops under high pruning ratios. To this end, we
propose {HoloV}, a simple yet effective, plug-and-play visual token pruning
framework for efficient inference. Distinct from previous attention-first
schemes, HoloV rethinks token retention from a holistic perspective. By
adaptively distributing the pruning budget across different spatial crops,
HoloV ensures that the retained tokens capture the global visual context rather
than isolated salient features. This strategy minimizes representational
collapse and maintains task-relevant information even under aggressive pruning.
Experimental results demonstrate that our HoloV achieves superior performance
across various tasks, MLLM architectures, and pruning ratios compared to SOTA
methods. For instance, LLaVA1.5 equipped with HoloV preserves 95.8\% of the
original performance after pruning 88.9\% of visual tokens, achieving superior
efficiency-accuracy trade-offs.

*Nikoo Naghavian,Mostafa Tavassolipour*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Confidence-Aware Weighting (CAW)方法增强视觉语言模型的零样本鲁棒性，包含置信度感知损失和特征对齐正则化，在保持泛化能力的同时提升干净和对抗样本的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型如CLIP在零样本泛化方面表现出色，但对对抗攻击高度脆弱，需要提升其鲁棒性。

Method: CAW包含两个组件：(1) 置信度感知损失，通过缩放干净和对抗预测之间的KL散度来优先处理不确定的对抗样本；(2) 特征对齐正则化，通过最小化冻结和微调图像编码器在对抗输入上的特征距离来保持语义一致性。

Result: 在TinyImageNet和14个额外数据集上的广泛实验表明，CAW在AutoAttack等强攻击下优于PMG-AFT和TGA-ZSR等最新方法，同时使用更少内存。

Conclusion: CAW方法有效提升了视觉语言模型的零样本鲁棒性，在不牺牲泛化能力的情况下同时改善了干净和对抗样本的性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models like CLIP demonstrate impressive zero-shot
generalization but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this
work, we propose Confidence-Aware Weighting (CAW) to enhance zero-shot
robustness in vision-language models. CAW consists of two components: (1) a
Confidence-Aware loss that prioritizes uncertain adversarial examples by
scaling the KL divergence between clean and adversarial predictions, and (2) a
feature alignment regularization that preserves semantic consistency by
minimizing the distance between frozen and fine-tuned image encoder features on
adversarial inputs. These components work jointly to improve both clean and
robust accuracy without sacrificing generalization. Extensive experiments on
TinyImageNet and 14 additional datasets show that CAW outperforms recent
methods such as PMG-AFT and TGA-ZSR under strong attacks like AutoAttack, while
using less memory.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型视觉语言模型在颈动脉粥样硬化疾病风险评估中的应用，通过整合超声图像与临床数据，发现现有模型在风险分类方面表现不佳，但通过领域适应和多模态数据整合可以显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 颈动脉粥样硬化疾病的风险评估需要整合多样化的临床和影像信息，且需要透明和可解释的方法供临床医生使用。本研究旨在探索最先进的大型视觉语言模型在多模态颈动脉斑块评估中的潜力。

Method: 提出了一个通过访谈式问题序列模拟真实诊断场景的框架，比较了多种开源LVLM模型。使用低秩适应（LoRA）将LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna模型适配到超声领域，并整合多模态表格数据。

Result: 零样本实验显示，并非所有LVLM都能准确识别成像模态和解剖结构，所有模型在准确风险分类方面表现不佳。经过领域适应后，在卒中风险分层方面取得显著改进，多模态数据整合进一步提高了特异性和平衡准确率。

Conclusion: 研究结果凸显了LVLM在超声心血管风险预测中的潜力和局限性，强调了多模态整合、模型校准和领域适应对于临床转化的重要性。

Abstract: Reliable risk assessment for carotid atheromatous disease remains a major
clinical challenge, as it requires integrating diverse clinical and imaging
information in a manner that is transparent and interpretable to clinicians.
This study investigates the potential of state-of-the-art and recent large
vision-language models (LVLMs) for multimodal carotid plaque assessment by
integrating ultrasound imaging (USI) with structured clinical, demographic,
laboratory, and protein biomarker data. A framework that simulates realistic
diagnostic scenarios through interview-style question sequences is proposed,
comparing a range of open-source LVLMs, including both general-purpose and
medically tuned models. Zero-shot experiments reveal that even if they are very
powerful, not all LVLMs can accurately identify imaging modality and anatomy,
while all of them perform poorly in accurate risk classification. To address
this limitation, LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna is adapted to the ultrasound domain using
low-rank adaptation (LoRA), resulting in substantial improvements in stroke
risk stratification. The integration of multimodal tabular data in the form of
text further enhances specificity and balanced accuracy, yielding competitive
performance compared to prior convolutional neural network (CNN) baselines
trained on the same dataset. Our findings highlight both the promise and
limitations of LVLMs in ultrasound-based cardiovascular risk prediction,
underscoring the importance of multimodal integration, model calibration, and
domain adaptation for clinical translation.

Motivation: 现有方法使用深度自编码器生成器参数效率低，缺乏可解释的训练策略，需要改进多期相增强MRI合成中的特征分离

Method: 使用轻量级特征解耦VAE模型，将输入和目标图像编码为关于标准正态分布对称的两个潜在分布，采用Y形双向训练策略增强特征分离可解释性

Result: 相比现有深度自编码器端到端合成方法，FDA-VAE显著减少模型参数和推理时间，同时有效提高合成质量

Conclusion: FDA-VAE是用于多期相增强MRI合成的有效轻量级模型，通过对称潜在分布成功分离共享和独立特征

Abstract: Separating shared and independent features is crucial for multi-phase
contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI synthesis. However, existing methods use deep
autoencoder generators with low parameter efficiency and lack interpretable
training strategies. In this paper, we propose Flip Distribution Alignment
Variational Autoencoder (FDA-VAE), a lightweight feature-decoupled VAE model
for multi-phase CE MRI synthesis. Our method encodes input and target images
into two latent distributions that are symmetric concerning a standard normal
distribution, effectively separating shared and independent features. The
Y-shaped bidirectional training strategy further enhances the interpretability
of feature separation. Experimental results show that compared to existing deep
autoencoder-based end-to-end synthesis methods, FDA-VAE significantly reduces
model parameters and inference time while effectively improving synthesis
quality. The source code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了LPG-Bench基准测试和TIT评估方法，用于解决大模型在长文本提示图像生成中的不一致性问题，通过文本-图像-文本一致性评估提升与人类判断的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像模型在短提示下表现良好，但在理解和遵循长而详细的提示时存在困难，生成结果不一致。需要专门评估长提示生成能力的基准和指标。

Method: 1) 构建LPG-Bench基准：包含200个平均长度超过250词的长提示，生成2600张图像并进行人工标注；2) 提出TIT评估方法：通过比较原始提示与LMM对生成图像的描述来量化一致性，包括TIT-Score和TIT-Score-LLM两种实现。

Result: 实验表明现有T2I评估指标在长提示图像生成上与人类偏好一致性差，而TIT方法显著优于基线，TIT-Score-LLM在成对准确率上比最强基线提升7.31%。

Conclusion: LPG-Bench和TIT方法为评估和促进T2I模型发展提供了新视角，能够更准确地评估长提示下的图像生成质量。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large multimodal models (LMMs), recent
text-to-image (T2I) models can generate high-quality images and demonstrate
great alignment to short prompts. However, they still struggle to effectively
understand and follow long and detailed prompts, displaying inconsistent
generation. To address this challenge, we introduce LPG-Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating long-prompt-based text-to-image generation. LPG-Bench
features 200 meticulously crafted prompts with an average length of over 250
words, approaching the input capacity of several leading commercial models.
Using these prompts, we generate 2,600 images from 13 state-of-the-art models
and further perform comprehensive human-ranked annotations. Based on LPG-Bench,
we observe that state-of-the-art T2I alignment evaluation metrics exhibit poor
consistency with human preferences on long-prompt-based image generation. To
address the gap, we introduce a novel zero-shot metric based on
text-to-image-to-text consistency, termed TIT, for evaluating
long-prompt-generated images. The core concept of TIT is to quantify T2I
alignment by directly comparing the consistency between the raw prompt and the
LMM-produced description on the generated image, which includes an efficient
score-based instantiation TIT-Score and a large-language-model (LLM) based
instantiation TIT-Score-LLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves superior alignment with human judgment compared to
CLIP-score, LMM-score, etc., with TIT-Score-LLM attaining a 7.31% absolute
improvement in pairwise accuracy over the strongest baseline. LPG-Bench and TIT
methods together offer a deeper perspective to benchmark and foster the
development of T2I models. All resources will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有3D编辑方法存在的速度慢、几何失真、依赖手动3D掩码等问题，提升3D编辑的跨视图一致性、结构保真度和细粒度可控性。

Method: 1）构建3DEditVerse数据集（116,309训练对+1,500测试对）；2）提出3DEditFormer模型，采用双引导注意力和时间自适应门控机制，在图像到3D生成过程中分离可编辑区域和保留结构。

Result: 在广泛实验中，该框架在定量和定性评估上均优于现有最先进方法，为实用和可扩展的3D编辑设立了新标准。

Conclusion: 提出的3DEditVerse数据集和3DEditFormer模型有效解决了3D编辑的关键挑战，实现了无需辅助3D掩码的精确一致编辑，推动了3D编辑技术的发展。

Abstract: 3D editing - the task of locally modifying the geometry or appearance of a 3D
asset - has wide applications in immersive content creation, digital
entertainment, and AR/VR. However, unlike 2D editing, it remains challenging
due to the need for cross-view consistency, structural fidelity, and
fine-grained controllability. Existing approaches are often slow, prone to
geometric distortions, or dependent on manual and accurate 3D masks that are
error-prone and impractical. To address these challenges, we advance both the
data and model fronts. On the data side, we introduce 3DEditVerse, the largest
paired 3D editing benchmark to date, comprising 116,309 high-quality training
pairs and 1,500 curated test pairs. Built through complementary pipelines of
pose-driven geometric edits and foundation model-guided appearance edits,
3DEditVerse ensures edit locality, multi-view consistency, and semantic
alignment. On the model side, we propose 3DEditFormer, a
3D-structure-preserving conditional transformer. By enhancing image-to-3D
generation with dual-guidance attention and time-adaptive gating, 3DEditFormer
disentangles editable regions from preserved structure, enabling precise and
consistent edits without requiring auxiliary 3D masks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines both
quantitatively and qualitatively, establishing a new standard for practical and
scalable 3D editing. Dataset and code will be released. Project:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Sentinel-2数据集多为无云图像，在热带云层常见地区实用性有限，需要解决云遮挡问题和深度网络中空间/光谱细节丢失的问题。

Method: 开发云层注入算法模拟真实云覆盖；提出轻量级NDI注入方法，将归一化差异指数注入最终解码层以保留关键空间特征；结合Sentinel-1雷达数据与光学图像融合。

Result: 在DFC2020数据集上，NDI注入使U-Net和DeepLabV3在无云图像上的性能分别提升1.99%和2.78%；在云覆盖条件下，结合Sentinel-1数据相比仅使用光学数据在所有模型上都取得了显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 雷达-光学数据融合在挑战性大气场景中非常有效，NDI注入方法能够以最小计算成本提升土地覆盖分割性能。

Abstract: Supervised deep learning for land cover semantic segmentation (LCS) relies on
labeled satellite data. However, most existing Sentinel-2 datasets are
cloud-free, which limits their usefulness in tropical regions where clouds are
common. To properly evaluate the extent of this problem, we developed a cloud
injection algorithm that simulates realistic cloud cover, allowing us to test
how Sentinel-1 radar data can fill in the gaps caused by cloud-obstructed
optical imagery. We also tackle the issue of losing spatial and/or spectral
details during encoder downsampling in deep networks. To mitigate this loss, we
propose a lightweight method that injects Normalized Difference Indices (NDIs)
into the final decoding layers, enabling the model to retain key spatial
features with minimal additional computation. Injecting NDIs enhanced land
cover segmentation performance on the DFC2020 dataset, yielding improvements of
1.99% for U-Net and 2.78% for DeepLabV3 on cloud-free imagery. Under
cloud-covered conditions, incorporating Sentinel-1 data led to significant
performance gains across all models compared to using optical data alone,
highlighting the effectiveness of radar-optical fusion in challenging
atmospheric scenarios.

Conclusion: PocketSR成功地将生成建模能力引入RealSR，同时保持高保真度和高效性，为边缘设备应用提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (RealSR) aims to enhance the visual quality
of in-the-wild images, such as those captured by mobile phones. While existing
methods leveraging large generative models demonstrate impressive results, the
high computational cost and latency make them impractical for edge deployment.
In this paper, we introduce PocketSR, an ultra-lightweight, single-step model
that brings generative modeling capabilities to RealSR while maintaining high
fidelity. To achieve this, we design LiteED, a highly efficient alternative to
the original computationally intensive VAE in SD, reducing parameters by 97.5%
while preserving high-quality encoding and decoding. Additionally, we propose
online annealing pruning for the U-Net, which progressively shifts generative
priors from heavy modules to lightweight counterparts, ensuring effective
knowledge transfer and further optimizing efficiency. To mitigate the loss of
prior knowledge during pruning, we incorporate a multi-layer feature
distillation loss. Through an in-depth analysis of each design component, we
provide valuable insights for future research. PocketSR, with a model size of
146M parameters, processes 4K images in just 0.8 seconds, achieving a
remarkable speedup over previous methods. Notably, it delivers performance on
par with state-of-the-art single-step and even multi-step RealSR models, making
it a highly practical solution for edge-device applications.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has surged in response to challenging
questions, especially when a long video must depict multiple sequential events
with temporal coherence and controllable content. Existing methods that extend
to multi-event generation omit an inspection of the intrinsic factor in event
shifting. The paper aims to answer the central question: When and where
multi-event prompts control event transition during T2V generation. This work
introduces MEve, a self-curated prompt suite for evaluating multi-event
text-to-video (T2V) generation, and conducts a systematic study of two
representative model families, i.e., OpenSora and CogVideoX. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the importance of early intervention in denoising steps
and block-wise model layers, revealing the essential factor for multi-event
video generation and highlighting the possibilities for multi-event

Abstract: Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is a key task in affective computing,
enabling applications in human-computer interaction, e-learning, healthcare,
and safety systems. Despite advances in deep learning, FER remains challenging
due to occlusions, illumination and pose variations, subtle intra-class
differences, and dataset imbalance that hinders recognition of minority
emotions. We present InsideOut, a reproducible FER framework built on
EfficientNetV2-S with transfer learning, strong data augmentation, and
imbalance-aware optimization. The approach standardizes FER2013 images, applies
stratified splitting and augmentation, and fine-tunes a lightweight
classification head with class-weighted loss to address skewed distributions.
InsideOut achieves 62.8% accuracy with a macro averaged F1 of 0.590 on FER2013,
showing competitive results compared to conventional CNN baselines. The novelty
lies in demonstrating that efficient architectures, combined with tailored
imbalance handling, can provide practical, transparent, and reproducible FER
solutions.

Abstract: Compositional generalization, the ability to generate novel combinations of
known concepts, is a key ingredient for visual generative models. Yet, not all
mechanisms that enable or inhibit it are fully understood. In this work, we
conduct a systematic study of how various design choices influence
compositional generalization in image and video generation in a positive or
negative way. Through controlled experiments, we identify two key factors: (i)
whether the training objective operates on a discrete or continuous

the constituent concepts during training. Building on these insights, we show
that relaxing the MaskGIT discrete loss with an auxiliary continuous JEPA-based

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于扩散模型潜在空间的图像扰动方法，通过改变去噪轨迹的起点来生成不可学习的训练样本，保护数据隐私和防止未经授权的模型个性化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型的个性化能力引发了数据隐私、知识产权保护和未经授权使用的担忧，需要开发能够防止模型复制的防御方法。

Method: 在扩散模型的潜在空间中操作，交替进行去噪和反转过程，修改去噪轨迹的起点，生成视觉保真度高但难以被下游生成模型反演和个性化的扰动图像。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的验证表明，该方法在感知指标（PSNR、SSIM、FID）上提升了约8%-10%，在五种对抗设置下的鲁棒性平均提升了约10%。

Conclusion: 该方法为保护敏感数据提供了一种实用且难以察觉的防御机制，有效防止未经授权的模型适应。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in
rapid and high-fidelity personalization, even when provided with only a few
user images. However, the effectiveness of personalization techniques has lead
to concerns regarding data privacy, intellectual property protection, and
unauthorized usage. To mitigate such unauthorized usage and model replication,
the idea of generating ``unlearnable'' training samples utilizing image
poisoning techniques has emerged. Existing methods for this have limited
imperceptibility as they operate in the pixel space which results in images
with noise and artifacts. In this work, we propose a novel model-based
perturbation strategy that operates within the latent space of diffusion
models. Our method alternates between denoising and inversion while modifying
the starting point of the denoising trajectory: of diffusion models. This
trajectory-shifted sampling ensures that the perturbed images maintain high
visual fidelity to the original inputs while being resistant to inversion and
personalization by downstream generative models. This approach integrates
unlearnability into the framework of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), enabling a
practical and imperceptible defense against unauthorized model adaptation. We
validate our approach on four benchmark datasets to demonstrate robustness
against state-of-the-art inversion attacks. Results demonstrate that our method
achieves significant improvements in imperceptibility ($\sim 8 \% -10\%$ on
perceptual metrics including PSNR, SSIM, and FID) and robustness ( $\sim 10\%$
on average across five adversarial settings), highlighting its effectiveness in
safeguarding sensitive data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在辐射场语义蒸馏中几何基础特征的作用，发现虽然几何基础特征包含更多几何细节，但在语义目标定位和姿态估计任务中表现不如纯视觉特征，提出了无需初始猜测的辐射场反演框架SPINE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索几何基础语义特征在蒸馏辐射场中的潜在优势，特别是对于空间任务如姿态估计的影响，填补了现有研究在语义集成方面的空白。

Method: 提出了SPINE框架，包含两个核心组件：使用蒸馏语义的粗反演和使用光度优化的精细反演，无需初始猜测即可反演辐射场。

Result: 几何基础特征包含更精细的结构细节，但在语义目标定位任务中无显著差异，在姿态估计任务中准确性反而下降，纯视觉特征在更广泛的下游任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 纯视觉特征在多样化下游任务中具有更好的通用性，未来需要研究更有效的几何基础策略来增强预训练语义特征的通用性和性能。

Abstract: Semantic distillation in radiance fields has spurred significant advances in
open-vocabulary robot policies, e.g., in manipulation and navigation, founded
on pretrained semantics from large vision models. While prior work has
demonstrated the effectiveness of visual-only semantic features (e.g., DINO and
CLIP) in Gaussian Splatting and neural radiance fields, the potential benefit
of geometry-grounding in distilled fields remains an open question. In
principle, visual-geometry features seem very promising for spatial tasks such
as pose estimation, prompting the question: Do geometry-grounded semantic
features offer an edge in distilled fields? Specifically, we ask three critical
questions: First, does spatial-grounding produce higher-fidelity geometry-aware
semantic features? We find that image features from geometry-grounded backbones
contain finer structural details compared to their counterparts. Secondly, does
geometry-grounding improve semantic object localization? We observe no
significant difference in this task. Thirdly, does geometry-grounding enable
higher-accuracy radiance field inversion? Given the limitations of prior work
and their lack of semantics integration, we propose a novel framework SPINE for
inverting radiance fields without an initial guess, consisting of two core
components: coarse inversion using distilled semantics, and fine inversion
using photometric-based optimization. Surprisingly, we find that the pose
estimation accuracy decreases with geometry-grounded features. Our results
suggest that visual-only features offer greater versatility for a broader range
of downstream tasks, although geometry-grounded features contain more geometric
detail. Notably, our findings underscore the necessity of future research on
effective strategies for geometry-grounding that augment the versatility and
performance of pretrained semantic features.

### [43] [GeoComplete: Geometry-Aware Diffusion for Reference-Driven Image Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03110)
*Beibei Lin,Tingting Chen,Robby T. Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoComplete是一个新颖的参考驱动图像补全框架，通过整合显式3D结构指导和目标感知掩码策略，显著提升了补全区域的几何一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成方法仅依赖扩散先验，缺乏几何线索（如相机位姿或深度），导致补全内容错位或不合理。当目标视图与参考图像差异较大时，这一问题尤为突出。

Method: 采用双分支扩散架构：一个分支从掩码目标合成缺失区域，另一个分支从投影点云提取几何特征。通过联合自注意力机制确保一致性，并使用目标感知掩码策略指导模型关注相关参考线索。

Result: 实验表明GeoComplete在PSNR指标上比最先进方法提升17.1，显著提高了几何准确性，同时保持高视觉质量。

Conclusion: 通过结合几何感知的双分支扩散架构和目标感知掩码策略，GeoComplete为几何条件图像补全提供了统一且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Reference-driven image completion, which restores missing regions in a target
view using additional images, is particularly challenging when the target view
differs significantly from the references. Existing generative methods rely
solely on diffusion priors and, without geometric cues such as camera pose or
depth, often produce misaligned or implausible content. We propose GeoComplete,
a novel framework that incorporates explicit 3D structural guidance to enforce
geometric consistency in the completed regions, setting it apart from prior
image-only approaches. GeoComplete introduces two key ideas: conditioning the
diffusion process on projected point clouds to infuse geometric information,
and applying target-aware masking to guide the model toward relevant reference
cues. The framework features a dual-branch diffusion architecture. One branch
synthesizes the missing regions from the masked target, while the other
extracts geometric features from the projected point cloud. Joint
self-attention across branches ensures coherent and accurate completion. To
address regions visible in references but absent in the target, we project the
target view into each reference to detect occluded areas, which are then masked
during training. This target-aware masking directs the model to focus on useful
cues, enhancing performance in difficult scenarios. By integrating a
geometry-aware dual-branch diffusion architecture with a target-aware masking
strategy, GeoComplete offers a unified and robust solution for
geometry-conditioned image completion. Experiments show that GeoComplete
achieves a 17.1 PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods, significantly
boosting geometric accuracy while maintaining high visual quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到有声视频生成中的两个关键挑战：(1)共享文本标题造成的模态干扰问题；(2)跨模态特征交互机制不明确的问题。

Method: 提出分层视觉基础标题生成(HVGC)框架生成解耦的视频和音频标题，以及基于此的BridgeDiT双塔扩散变换器，采用双向交叉注意力机制实现语义和时间同步。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的广泛实验和人类评估表明，该方法在大多数指标上达到了最先进水平，消融研究验证了各贡献的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了T2SV任务中的模态干扰和跨模态交互问题，为未来研究提供了重要见解，所有代码和检查点将公开发布。

Abstract: This study focuses on a challenging yet promising task,
Text-to-Sounding-Video (T2SV) generation, which aims to generate a video with
synchronized audio from text conditions, meanwhile ensuring both modalities are
aligned with text. Despite progress in joint audio-video training, two critical
challenges still remain unaddressed: (1) a single, shared text caption where
the text for video is equal to the text for audio often creates modal
interference, confusing the pretrained backbones, and (2) the optimal mechanism
for cross-modal feature interaction remains unclear. To address these
challenges, we first propose the Hierarchical Visual-Grounded Captioning (HVGC)
framework that generates pairs of disentangled captions, a video caption, and
an audio caption, eliminating interference at the conditioning stage. Based on
HVGC, we further introduce BridgeDiT, a novel dual-tower diffusion transformer,
which employs a Dual CrossAttention (DCA) mechanism that acts as a robust
``bridge" to enable a symmetric, bidirectional exchange of information,
achieving both semantic and temporal synchronization. Extensive experiments on
three benchmark datasets, supported by human evaluations, demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art results on most metrics. Comprehensive
ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our contributions,
offering key insights for the future T2SV task. All the codes and checkpoints
will be publicly released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HAVIR模型通过分离视觉皮层的层次结构，分别提取结构和语义特征，结合潜在扩散模型重建复杂视觉场景，在结构质量和语义准确性上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在重建复杂视觉刺激时面临挑战，因为自然场景的低级特征具有异质性，而高级特征存在语义纠缠。受视觉皮层层次表示理论启发，需要分别处理结构和语义信息。

Method: 将视觉皮层分为两个层次区域：结构生成器从空间处理体素提取结构信息并转换为潜在扩散先验，语义提取器将语义处理体素转换为CLIP嵌入，通过Versatile Diffusion模型整合生成最终图像。

Result: 实验结果表明HAVIR在复杂场景中提升了重建图像的结构和语义质量，性能优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 基于视觉皮层层次表示理论的分离处理方法能有效改善从脑活动重建视觉信息的效果，特别是在处理复杂视觉刺激时表现优异。

Abstract: The reconstruction of visual information from brain activity fosters
interdisciplinary integration between neuroscience and computer vision.
However, existing methods still face challenges in accurately recovering highly
complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from the characteristics of
natural scenes: low-level features exhibit heterogeneity, while high-level
features show semantic entanglement due to contextual overlaps. Inspired by the
hierarchical representation theory of the visual cortex, we propose the HAVIR
model, which separates the visual cortex into two hierarchical regions and
extracts distinct features from each. Specifically, the Structural Generator
extracts structural information from spatial processing voxels and converts it
into latent diffusion priors, while the Semantic Extractor converts semantic
processing voxels into CLIP embeddings. These components are integrated via the
Versatile Diffusion model to synthesize the final image. Experimental results
demonstrate that HAVIR enhances both the structural and semantic quality of
reconstructions, even in complex scenes, and outperforms existing models.

TL;DR: Mask2IV是一个用于交互中心视频生成的两阶段框架，无需密集掩码输入，通过预测动作轨迹来生成高质量的人机交互视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以建模复杂的动态交互，而获取精确的掩码标注在现实应用中具有挑战性。

Method: 采用解耦的两阶段流程：首先预测动作和物体的运动轨迹，然后基于这些轨迹生成视频。支持通过动作描述或空间位置线索来引导运动轨迹。

Result: 在两个涵盖人机交互和机器人操作场景的基准测试中，该方法在视觉真实性和可控性方面优于现有基线。

Conclusion: Mask2IV框架在无需密集掩码输入的情况下，实现了高质量的交互中心视频生成，具有出色的灵活性和控制能力。

Abstract: Generating interaction-centric videos, such as those depicting humans or
robots interacting with objects, is crucial for embodied intelligence, as they
provide rich and diverse visual priors for robot learning, manipulation policy
training, and affordance reasoning. However, existing methods often struggle to
model such complex and dynamic interactions. While recent studies show that
masks can serve as effective control signals and enhance generation quality,
obtaining dense and precise mask annotations remains a major challenge for
real-world use. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Mask2IV, a novel
framework specifically designed for interaction-centric video generation. It
adopts a decoupled two-stage pipeline that first predicts plausible motion
trajectories for both actor and object, then generates a video conditioned on
these trajectories. This design eliminates the need for dense mask inputs from
users while preserving the flexibility to manipulate the interaction process.
Furthermore, Mask2IV supports versatile and intuitive control, allowing users
to specify the target object of interaction and guide the motion trajectory
through action descriptions or spatial position cues. To support systematic
training and evaluation, we curate two benchmarks covering diverse action and
object categories across both human-object interaction and robotic manipulation
scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior
visual realism and controllability compared to existing baselines.

Abstract: Accurately modeling human mobility is critical for urban planning,
epidemiology, and traffic management. In this work, we introduce Markovian Reeb
Graphs, a novel framework for simulating spatiotemporal trajectories that
preserve Patterns of Life (PoLs) learned from baseline data. By combining
individual- and population-level mobility structures within a probabilistic
topological model, our approach generates realistic future trajectories that
capture both consistency and variability in daily life. Evaluations on the
Urban Anomalies dataset (Atlanta and Berlin subsets) using the Jensen-Shannon
Divergence (JSD) across population- and agent-level metrics demonstrate that
the proposed method achieves strong fidelity while remaining data- and
compute-efficient. These results position Markovian Reeb Graphs as a scalable
framework for trajectory simulation with broad applicability across diverse
urban environments.

TL;DR: SpineMed是一个专为脊柱疾病诊断设计的AI生态系统，包含首个大规模多模态脊柱数据集SpineMed-450k和临床评估框架SpineBench，显著提升了AI在椎体级别推理方面的能力。


<details>

Motivation: 脊柱疾病影响全球6.19亿人，是致残的主要原因，但AI辅助诊断因缺乏椎体级别感知的多模态数据集而受限。临床决策需要跨X光、CT和MRI在特定椎体级别进行复杂推理。

Method: 与执业脊柱外科医生共同设计，采用两阶段LLM生成方法（草稿和修订）构建SpineMed-450k数据集，包含45万条指令实例，涵盖教科书、指南、开放数据集和约1000个医院病例。

Result: 对先进大视觉语言模型的评估显示其在细粒度椎体级别推理方面存在系统性弱点，而在SpineMed-450k上微调的模型在所有任务上均表现出显著改进。

Conclusion: 临床医生评估证实了模型输出的诊断清晰度和实用性，SpineMed为脊柱AI诊断提供了高质量的数据集和标准化评估框架。

Abstract: Spine disorders affect 619 million people globally and are a leading cause of
disability, yet AI-assisted diagnosis remains limited by the lack of
level-aware, multimodal datasets. Clinical decision-making for spine disorders
requires sophisticated reasoning across X-ray, CT, and MRI at specific
vertebral levels. However, progress has been constrained by the absence of
traceable, clinically-grounded instruction data and standardized,
spine-specific benchmarks. To address this, we introduce SpineMed, an ecosystem
co-designed with practicing spine surgeons. It features SpineMed-450k, the
first large-scale dataset explicitly designed for vertebral-level reasoning
across imaging modalities with over 450,000 instruction instances, and
SpineBench, a clinically-grounded evaluation framework. SpineMed-450k is
curated from diverse sources, including textbooks, guidelines, open datasets,
and ~1,000 de-identified hospital cases, using a clinician-in-the-loop pipeline
with a two-stage LLM generation method (draft and revision) to ensure
high-quality, traceable data for question-answering, multi-turn consultations,
and report generation. SpineBench evaluates models on clinically salient axes,
including level identification, pathology assessment, and surgical planning.
Our comprehensive evaluation of several recently advanced large vision-language
models (LVLMs) on SpineBench reveals systematic weaknesses in fine-grained,
level-specific reasoning. In contrast, our model fine-tuned on SpineMed-450k
demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across all tasks.
Clinician assessments confirm the diagnostic clarity and practical utility of
our model's outputs.

Conclusion: UniShield通过创新的多智能体架构有效解决了跨域图像伪造检测的挑战，为维护信息完整性和社会安全提供了强有力的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in image generation, synthetic images have become
increasingly realistic, posing significant societal risks, such as
misinformation and fraud. Forgery Image Detection and Localization (FIDL) thus
emerges as essential for maintaining information integrity and societal
security. Despite impressive performances by existing domain-specific detection
methods, their practical applicability remains limited, primarily due to their
narrow specialization, poor cross-domain generalization, and the absence of an
integrated adaptive framework. To address these issues, we propose UniShield,
the novel multi-agent-based unified system capable of detecting and localizing
image forgeries across diverse domains, including image manipulation, document
manipulation, DeepFake, and AI-generated images. UniShield innovatively
integrates a perception agent with a detection agent. The perception agent
intelligently analyzes image features to dynamically select suitable detection
models, while the detection agent consolidates various expert detectors into a
unified framework and generates interpretable reports. Extensive experiments
show that UniShield achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both existing
unified approaches and domain-specific detectors, highlighting its superior
practicality, adaptiveness, and scalability.

Conclusion: ROGR方法能够高效重建可重光照的3D模型，在任意环境光照下实现高质量的重光照效果，无需逐光照优化。

Abstract: We introduce ROGR, a novel approach that reconstructs a relightable 3D model
of an object captured from multiple views, driven by a generative relighting
model that simulates the effects of placing the object under novel environment
illuminations. Our method samples the appearance of the object under multiple
lighting environments, creating a dataset that is used to train a
lighting-conditioned Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) that outputs the object's
appearance under any input environmental lighting. The lighting-conditioned
NeRF uses a novel dual-branch architecture to encode the general lighting
effects and specularities separately. The optimized lighting-conditioned NeRF
enables efficient feed-forward relighting under arbitrary environment maps
without requiring per-illumination optimization or light transport simulation.
We evaluate our approach on the established TensoIR and Stanford-ORB datasets,
where it improves upon the state-of-the-art on most metrics, and showcase our
approach on real-world object captures.

Abstract: Product quantisation (PQ) is a classical method for scalable vector encoding,
yet it has seen limited usage for latent representations in high-fidelity image
generation. In this work, we introduce PQGAN, a quantised image autoencoder
that integrates PQ into the well-known vector quantisation (VQ) framework of
VQGAN. PQGAN achieves a noticeable improvement over state-of-the-art methods in
terms of reconstruction performance, including both quantisation methods and
their continuous counterparts. We achieve a PSNR score of 37dB, where prior
work achieves 27dB, and are able to reduce the FID, LPIPS, and CMMD score by up
to 96%. Our key to success is a thorough analysis of the interaction between
codebook size, embedding dimensionality, and subspace factorisation, with
vector and scalar quantisation as special cases. We obtain novel findings, such
that the performance of VQ and PQ behaves in opposite ways when scaling the
embedding dimension. Furthermore, our analysis shows performance trends for PQ
that help guide optimal hyperparameter selection. Finally, we demonstrate that
PQGAN can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained diffusion models. This
enables either a significantly faster and more compute-efficient generation, or
a doubling of the output resolution at no additional cost, positioning PQ as a
strong extension for discrete latent representation in image synthesis.

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models have proved effective for world
modeling and interactive scene generation, with Minecraft gameplay as a
representative application. To faithfully simulate play, a model must generate
natural content while exploring new scenes and preserve spatial consistency
when revisiting explored areas. Under limited computation budgets, it must
compress and exploit historical cues within a finite context window, which
exposes a trade-off: Temporal-only memory lacks long-term spatial consistency,
whereas adding spatial memory strengthens consistency but may degrade new scene
generation quality when the model over-relies on insufficient spatial context.
We present Memory Forcing, a learning framework that pairs training protocols
with a geometry-indexed spatial memory. Hybrid Training exposes distinct
gameplay regimes, guiding the model to rely on temporal memory during
exploration and incorporate spatial memory for revisits. Chained Forward
Training extends autoregressive training with model rollouts, where chained
predictions create larger pose variations and encourage reliance on spatial
memory for maintaining consistency. Point-to-Frame Retrieval efficiently
retrieves history by mapping currently visible points to their source frames,
while Incremental 3D Reconstruction maintains and updates an explicit 3D cache.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Memory Forcing achieves superior
long-term spatial consistency and generative quality across diverse
environments, while maintaining computational efficiency for extended
sequences.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonSTeR是首个运动-场景-文本检索模型，通过构建统一潜空间来捕获模态间复杂依赖关系，支持灵活跨模态检索任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏评估骨骼运动（运动）、意图（文本）和周围环境（场景）之间对齐关系的工具，而人类运动需要环境支持才能实现。

Method: 利用单模态和跨模态表示构建统一潜空间，模拟高阶关系以捕获模态间复杂依赖关系。

Result: MonSTeR在检索任务中优于仅依赖单模态表示的三模态模型，用户研究验证了检索得分与人类偏好的一致性。

Conclusion: MonSTeR展示了在场景内物体放置和运动描述等零样本任务中的多功能性，为运动-场景-文本对齐提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Intention drives human movement in complex environments, but such movement
can only happen if the surrounding context supports it. Despite the intuitive
nature of this mechanism, existing research has not yet provided tools to
evaluate the alignment between skeletal movement (motion), intention (text),
and the surrounding context (scene). In this work, we introduce MonSTeR, the
first MOtioN-Scene-TExt Retrieval model. Inspired by the modeling of
higher-order relations, MonSTeR constructs a unified latent space by leveraging
unimodal and cross-modal representations. This allows MonSTeR to capture the
intricate dependencies between modalities, enabling flexible but robust
retrieval across various tasks. Our results show that MonSTeR outperforms
trimodal models that rely solely on unimodal representations. Furthermore, we
validate the alignment of our retrieval scores with human preferences through a
dedicated user study. We demonstrate the versatility of MonSTeR's latent space
on zero-shot in-Scene Object Placement and Motion Captioning. Code and
pre-trained models are available at github.com/colloroneluca/MonSTeR.

*Dong Lao,Yuxiang Zhang,Haniyeh Ehsani Oskouie,Yangchao Wu,Alex Wong,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于随机共振的测试时防御机制，通过引入微小平移扰动来对抗对抗性攻击，无需额外训练或特定攻击类型调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法依赖特征过滤或平滑，可能导致信息损失，需要一种能增强鲁棒性同时最小化信息损失的方法。

Method: 对输入图像引入微小平移扰动，对齐变换后的特征嵌入并聚合，然后映射回原始参考图像，采用闭式公式实现。

Result: 在图像分类中恢复高达68.1%的准确率损失，在立体匹配中恢复71.9%，在光流中恢复29.2%，首次为密集预测任务建立通用测试时防御。

Conclusion: 该方法完全无需训练、架构无关且攻击无关，具有出色的通用性和实用性，在多种任务上达到最先进的鲁棒性。

Abstract: We propose a test-time defense mechanism against adversarial attacks:
imperceptible image perturbations that significantly alter the predictions of a
model. Unlike existing methods that rely on feature filtering or smoothing,
which can lead to information loss, we propose to "combat noise with noise" by
leveraging stochastic resonance to enhance robustness while minimizing
information loss. Our approach introduces small translational perturbations to
the input image, aligns the transformed feature embeddings, and aggregates them
before mapping back to the original reference image. This can be expressed in a
closed-form formula, which can be deployed on diverse existing network
architectures without introducing additional network modules or fine-tuning for
specific attack types. The resulting method is entirely training-free,
architecture-agnostic, and attack-agnostic. Empirical results show
state-of-the-art robustness on image classification and, for the first time,
establish a generic test-time defense for dense prediction tasks, including
stereo matching and optical flow, highlighting the method's versatility and
practicality. Specifically, relative to clean (unperturbed) performance, our
method recovers up to 68.1% of the accuracy loss on image classification, 71.9%
on stereo matching, and 29.2% on optical flow under various types of
adversarial attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有随机神经网络方法主要关注改进跨信息预测，但在整体网络架构方面缺乏显著进展。

Method: 使用超球面随机嵌入结合双分支学习模块来捕获通道内和通道间关系，并通过新制定的优化问题构建丰富的纹理表示。

Result: 在多个具有不同特征和挑战的纯纹理基准测试中取得了有趣的结果。

Conclusion: Mixer方法在纹理表示学习方面表现出色，源代码将在发表后提供。

Abstract: Randomized neural networks for representation learning have consistently
achieved prominent results in texture recognition tasks, effectively combining
the advantages of both traditional techniques and learning-based approaches.
However, existing approaches have so far focused mainly on improving
cross-information prediction, without introducing significant advancements to
the overall randomized network architecture. In this paper, we propose Mixer, a
novel randomized neural network for texture representation learning. At its
core, the method leverages hyperspherical random embeddings coupled with a
dual-branch learning module to capture both intra- and inter-channel
relationships, further enhanced by a newly formulated optimization problem for
building rich texture representations. Experimental results have shown the
interesting results of the proposed approach across several pure texture
benchmarks, each with distinct characteristics and challenges. The source code
will be available upon publication.

*Suyuchen Wang,Tianyu Zhang,Ahmed Masry,Christopher Pal,Spandana Gella,Bang Liu,Perouz Taslakian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了RULER tokens和I-MRoPE两种创新方法，通过显式坐标标记和对称空间编码，解决了GUI grounding任务中高分辨率显示器的坐标映射问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在GUI grounding任务中，特别是在高分辨率显示器上的坐标映射可靠性不足，主要瓶颈是patch-to-pixel映射在训练未见的高分辨率显示上失效。

Method: 1. RULER tokens作为显式坐标标记，让模型能够像地图网格线一样参考位置；2. I-MRoPE改进空间编码，确保宽度和高度维度对称表示。

Result: 在ScreenSpot、ScreenSpot-V2和ScreenSpot-Pro数据集上的实验显示，该方法在grounding准确性上取得一致提升，特别是在高分辨率界面上改进最大。

Conclusion: 通过提供显式空间指导而非依赖隐式学习，该方法能够在不同分辨率和平台上实现更可靠的GUI自动化。

Abstract: GUI grounding, the task of mapping natural-language instructions to pixel
coordinates, is crucial for autonomous agents, yet remains difficult for
current VLMs. The core bottleneck is reliable patch-to-pixel mapping, which
breaks when extrapolating to high-resolution displays unseen during training.
Current approaches generate coordinates as text tokens directly from visual
features, forcing the model to infer complex position-to-pixel mappings
implicitly; as a result, accuracy degrades and failures proliferate on new
resolutions. We address this with two complementary innovations. First, RULER
tokens serve as explicit coordinate markers, letting the model reference
positions similar to gridlines on a map and adjust rather than generate
coordinates from scratch. Second, Interleaved MRoPE (I-MRoPE) improves spatial
encoding by ensuring that width and height dimensions are represented equally,
addressing the asymmetry of standard positional schemes. Experiments on
ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-V2, and ScreenSpot-Pro show consistent gains in
grounding accuracy, with the largest improvements on high-resolution
interfaces. By providing explicit spatial guidance rather than relying on
implicit learning, our approach enables more reliable GUI automation across
diverse resolutions and platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在通用视觉基准上表现良好，但在医学影像等专业领域的分布外任务中表现不佳，这些领域标记数据有限且昂贵。

Method: 使用QA生成器通过标题蒸馏生成领域相关的伪问答对，并选择性更新与问答最相关的神经元，使QA生成器在蒸馏过程中有效获取领域特定知识。

Result: 在胃肠道内窥镜和体育VQA上的实验表明，LEAML在最小监督下始终优于标准微调方法。

Conclusion: LEAML框架在标签稀缺的专业领域视觉问答任务中表现出色，验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
general visual benchmarks but struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks in
specialized domains such as medical imaging, where labeled data is limited and
expensive. We introduce LEAML, a label-efficient adaptation framework that
leverages both scarce labeled VQA samples and abundant unlabeled images. Our
approach generates domain-relevant pseudo question-answer pairs for unlabeled
data using a QA generator regularized by caption distillation. Importantly, we
selectively update only those neurons most relevant to question-answering,
enabling the QA Generator to efficiently acquire domain-specific knowledge
during distillation. Experiments on gastrointestinal endoscopy and sports VQA
demonstrate that LEAML consistently outperforms standard fine-tuning under
minimal supervision, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed LEAML
framework.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CASAL是一种高效的对比激活引导算法，将激活引导的优势直接嵌入模型权重中，使LLM在知道答案时回答，不知道时保持沉默，减少幻觉30%-40%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常产生幻觉，自信地提供错误答案而不是承认无知。现有激活引导方法需要实时监控和干预，不适用于实际部署。

Method: CASAL连接可解释性与摊销优化，仅训练单个Transformer层的子模块，将激活引导效果直接烘焙到模型权重中。

Result: 在多个短问答基准上减少幻觉30%-40%，计算效率比LoRA基线高30倍，数据效率高20倍，在OOD领域也有效泛化，适用于文本和视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: CASAL是将可解释性方法应用于实际生产系统的有前景的步骤，首次证明对密集和MoE模型都有效的基于引导的训练方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities but often
hallucinate, confidently providing incorrect answers instead of admitting
ignorance. Prior work has shown that models encode linear representations of
their own knowledge and that activation steering can reduce hallucinations.
These approaches, however, require real-time monitoring and intervention during
inference. We introduce Contrastive Activation Steering for Amortized Learning
(CASAL), an efficient algorithm that connects interpretability with amortized
optimization. CASAL directly bakes the benefits of activation steering into
model's weights. Once trained, LLMs answer questions they know while abstaining
from answering those they do not. CASAL's light-weight design requires training
only a submodule of a single transformer layer and yet reduces hallucination by
30%-40% across multiple short-form QA benchmarks. CASAL is 30x more
compute-efficient and 20x more data-efficient than strong LoRA-based baselines
such as SFT and DPO, boosting its practical applicability in data scarce
domains. Importantly, CASAL also generalizes effectively to out-of-distribution
(OOD) domains. We showcase CASAL's flexibility in mitigating hallucinations in
both text-only and vision-language models. To our knowledge, CASAL is the first
steering-based training method that has been shown to be effective for both
dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. CASAL represents a promising step
forward for applying interpretability-inspired method for practical deployment
in production systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于动态专家聚类和结构化压缩的统一框架，解决MoE LLM的负载不均衡、参数冗余和通信开销三难问题，在保持性能的同时大幅提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MoE大语言模型面临的负载不均衡、参数冗余和通信开销三大挑战，寻求更高效、可扩展的模型架构。

Method: 使用动态专家聚类方法，基于参数和激活相似性定期重组专家；在集群内将专家权重分解为共享基矩阵和极低秩残差适配器；采用两阶段分层路由策略；使用异构精度方案和动态卸载机制。

Result: 在GLUE和WikiText-103上评估，匹配标准MoE模型质量的同时，总参数减少约80%，吞吐量提升10-20%，专家负载方差降低3倍以上。

Conclusion: 结构重组是实现可扩展、高效且内存有效的MoE LLM的原则性路径。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) face a trilemma of load
imbalance, parameter redundancy, and communication overhead. We introduce a
unified framework based on dynamic expert clustering and structured compression
to address these issues cohesively. Our method employs an online clustering
procedure that periodically regroups experts using a fused metric of parameter
and activation similarity, which stabilizes expert utilization. To our
knowledge, this is one of the first frameworks to leverage the semantic
embedding capability of the router to dynamically reconfigure the model's
architecture during training for substantial efficiency gains. Within each
cluster, we decompose expert weights into a shared base matrix and extremely
low-rank residual adapters, achieving up to fivefold parameter reduction per
group while preserving specialization. This structure enables a two-stage
hierarchical routing strategy: tokens are first assigned to a cluster, then to
specific experts within it, drastically reducing the routing search space and
the volume of all-to-all communication. Furthermore, a heterogeneous precision
scheme, which stores shared bases in FP16 and residual factors in INT4, coupled
with dynamic offloading of inactive clusters, reduces peak memory consumption
to levels comparable to dense models. Evaluated on GLUE and WikiText-103, our
framework matches the quality of standard MoE models while reducing total
parameters by approximately 80%, improving throughput by 10% to 20%, and
lowering expert load variance by a factor of over three. Our work demonstrates
that structural reorganization is a principled path toward scalable, efficient,
and memory-effective MoE LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然能加速文献合成，但存在幻觉和错误引用问题，限制了其在专家工作流程中的实用性。

Method: 采用有限状态机控制循环，包含相关性过滤、可回答性评分、问题分解和按需检索，结合向量检索和确定性引用管道，构建领域知识库。

Result: 在光子学领域的评估中，专家盲测显示RA-FSM优于Notebook LM和标准GPT API，具有更好的边界条件处理和证据使用能力，同时能探索超出NLM的内容范围。

Conclusion: RA-FSM设计强调透明、充分引用的答案，适用于高风险技术工作，并可推广到其他科学领域，但需要权衡延迟和成本开销。

Abstract: Large language models accelerate literature synthesis but can hallucinate and
mis-cite, limiting their usefulness in expert workflows. We present RA-FSM
(Research Assistant - Finite State Machine), a modular GPT-based research
assistant that wraps generation in a finite-state control loop: Relevance ->
Confidence -> Knowledge. The system is grounded in vector retrieval and a
deterministic citation pipeline. The controller filters out-of-scope queries,
scores answerability, decomposes questions, and triggers retrieval only when
needed, and emits answers with confidence labels and in-corpus, de-duplicated
references. A ranked-tier ingestion workflow constructs a domain knowledge base
from journals, conferences, indices, preprints, and patents, writing both to a
dense vector index and to a relational store of normalized metrics. We
implement the system for photonics and evaluate it on six task categories:
analytical reasoning, numerical analysis, methodological critique, comparative
synthesis, factual extraction, and application design. In blinded A/B reviews,
domain experts prefer RA-FSM to both a strong Notebook LM (NLM) and a vanilla
Default GPT API call single-pass baseline, citing stronger boundary-condition
handling and more defensible evidence use. Coverage and novelty analyses
indicate that RA-FSM explores beyond the NLM while incurring tunable latency
and cost overheads. The design emphasizes transparent, well-cited answers for
high-stakes technical work and is generalizable to other scientific domains.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合架构，结合了实时语音到语音模型的低延迟优势和级联系统的知识表达能力，通过后端LLM实时指导S2S模型生成更准确的语音响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实时S2S模型缺乏深度知识和语义理解，以及级联系统延迟过高破坏自然交互的问题。

Method: 采用混合架构：用户语音同时通过S2S变换器进行实时响应，并发送给后端LLM；LLM的文本响应实时注入以指导S2S模型的语音生成。

Result: 在MT-Bench基准测试中，系统在响应正确性上显著优于基线S2S模型，接近级联系统的性能，同时保持与基线相当的延迟。

Conclusion: 该混合架构成功平衡了响应延迟和知识表达能力，为实时语音交互系统提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time speech-to-speech (S2S) models excel at generating natural,
low-latency conversational responses but often lack deep knowledge and semantic
understanding. Conversely, cascaded systems combining automatic speech
recognition, a text-based Large Language Model (LLM), and text-to-speech
synthesis offer superior knowledge representation at the cost of high latency,
which disrupts the flow of natural interaction. This paper introduces a novel
hybrid architecture that bridges the gap between these two paradigms. Our
framework processes user speech through an S2S transformer for immediate
responsiveness while concurrently relaying the query to a powerful back-end
LLM. The LLM's text-based response is then injected in real time to guide the
S2S model's speech generation, effectively infusing its output with rich
knowledge without the full latency penalty of a cascaded system. We evaluated
our method using a speech-synthesized variant of the MT-Bench benchmark that
consists of multi-turn question-answering sessions. The results demonstrate
that our system substantially outperforms a baseline S2S model in response
correctness, approaching that of a cascaded system, while maintaining a latency
on par with the baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Med-MLLMs在低资源环境下存在两个推理瓶颈：内在推理瓶颈忽略医学图像细节，外在推理瓶颈未能融入专业医学知识。

Method: 通过内在医学知识增强（粗到细问题分解）和外在医学知识增强（生物医学知识图谱检索）来增强推理能力。

Result: 在八个Med-VQA基准测试中，零样本和少样本设置下均取得显著改进。

Conclusion: AMANDA框架有效解决了Med-MLLMs在低资源环境下的推理瓶颈问题，无需额外训练即可提升性能。

Abstract: Medical Multimodal Large Language Models (Med-MLLMs) have shown great promise
in medical visual question answering (Med-VQA). However, when deployed in
low-resource settings where abundant labeled data are unavailable, existing
Med-MLLMs commonly fail due to their medical reasoning capability bottlenecks:
(i) the intrinsic reasoning bottleneck that ignores the details from the
medical image; (ii) the extrinsic reasoning bottleneck that fails to
incorporate specialized medical knowledge. To address those limitations, we
propose AMANDA, a training-free agentic framework that performs medical
knowledge augmentation via LLM agents. Specifically, our intrinsic medical
knowledge augmentation focuses on coarse-to-fine question decomposition for
comprehensive diagnosis, while extrinsic medical knowledge augmentation grounds
the reasoning process via biomedical knowledge graph retrieval. Extensive
experiments across eight Med-VQA benchmarks demonstrate substantial
improvements in both zero-shot and few-shot Med-VQA settings. The code is
available at https://github.com/REAL-Lab-NU/AMANDA.

TL;DR: SelfJudge通过自监督训练验证器来加速LLM推理，通过评估语义保留来放宽验证标准，在多种NLP任务上实现更好的推理速度-准确性平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的judge解码方法依赖人工标注或可验证真值的任务，限制了在多样化NLP任务中的通用性。

Method: 通过目标模型的自监督训练验证器，通过评估替换标记后的响应是否保留原始含义来衡量语义保留。

Result: 实验显示SelfJudge在推理速度与准确性平衡方面优于现有的judge解码基线方法。

Conclusion: SelfJudge为更快的LLM推理提供了一个广泛适用的解决方案。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by verifying candidate tokens
from a draft model against a larger target model. Recent judge decoding boosts
this process by relaxing verification criteria by accepting draft tokens that
may exhibit minor discrepancies from target model output, but existing methods
are restricted by their reliance on human annotations or tasks with verifiable
ground truths, limiting generalizability across diverse NLP tasks. We propose
SelfJudge, which trains judge verifiers via self-supervision of the target
model. Our method measures semantic preservation by assessing whether
token-substituted responses preserve the meaning of original responses,
enabling automatic verifier training across diverse NLP tasks. Our experiments
show SelfJudge achieves superior inference-accuracy trade-offs than judge
decoding baselines, offering a broadly applicable solution for faster LLM
inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统神经文档检索将语料库视为扁平向量云的问题，充分利用语料库结构并提供可解释的检索过程

Method: 使用Cobweb框架构建原型树，采用广义最佳优先搜索和轻量级路径求和排序器两种推理方法

Result: 在MS MARCO和QQP数据集上，使用BERT/T5和GPT-2表示时，检索方法在强编码器嵌入上匹配点积搜索性能，在GPT-2向量性能下降时仍保持稳健

Conclusion: Cobweb提供竞争性效果、对嵌入质量的改进鲁棒性、可扩展性以及通过分层原型的可解释检索

Abstract: Neural document retrieval often treats a corpus as a flat cloud of vectors
scored at a single granularity, leaving corpus structure underused and
explanations opaque. We use Cobweb--a hierarchy-aware framework--to organize
sentence embeddings into a prototype tree and rank documents via coarse-to-fine
traversal. Internal nodes act as concept prototypes, providing multi-granular
relevance signals and a transparent rationale through retrieval paths. We
instantiate two inference approaches: a generalized best-first search and a
lightweight path-sum ranker. We evaluate our approaches on MS MARCO and QQP
with encoder (e.g., BERT/T5) and decoder (GPT-2) representations. Our results
show that our retrieval approaches match the dot product search on strong
encoder embeddings while remaining robust when kNN degrades: with GPT-2
vectors, dot product performance collapses whereas our approaches still
retrieve relevant results. Overall, our experiments suggest that Cobweb
provides competitive effectiveness, improved robustness to embedding quality,
scalability, and interpretable retrieval via hierarchical prototypes.

Motivation: 现有长上下文语言模型训练方法（如通用文本拼接或基于启发式的方法）经常无法保证真正的长距离依赖关系，需要专门的数据构建方法

Method: 利用预测熵识别文档中的高熵位置，从大型语料库中检索语义相关上下文，并通过评估是否能降低预测熵来验证其效用，构建包含验证依赖关系的128K长度序列训练数据

Result: 在RULER基准测试中表现显著提升，特别是在需要远距离信息的任务上；指令微调后在LongBenchv2上也取得实质性进展

Conclusion: 基于熵的验证对于长上下文训练是必要且有效的，能够确保依赖关系代表可测量的信息增益而非虚假相关性

Abstract: Training long-context language models to capture long-range dependencies
requires specialized data construction. Current approaches, such as generic
text concatenation or heuristic-based variants, frequently fail to guarantee
genuine long-range dependencies. We propose EntropyLong, a novel data
construction method that leverages predictive uncertainty to verify dependency
quality. Our approach identifies high-entropy positions in documents, retrieves
semantically relevant contexts from large corpora, and verifies their utility
by assessing whether they reduce prediction entropy. This model-in-the-loop
verification ensures each dependency represents measurable information gain
rather than spurious correlation. We construct training samples with long-range
dependencies by combining original documents with these verified contextual
supplements. Using FineWebEdu and Cosmopedia, we generate a dataset of
128K-length sequences with verified dependencies. Models trained on this data
demonstrate significant improvements on RULER benchmarks, particularly in tasks
requiring distant information. Following instruction fine-tuning, our models
also achieve substantial gains on LongBenchv2, demonstrating enhanced
long-context understanding. Extensive ablation studies further validate the
necessity and effectiveness of entropybased verification for long-context
training.

Motivation: 由于公开对话推荐系统数据稀缺，微调语言模型面临挑战，而现有语言模型作为用户模拟器生成的数据缺乏行为一致性，无法反映真实用户对话序列。

Method: 结合行为模拟器和语言模型提示技术，开发了生成与用户底层状态一致的自然对话的方法论，应用于创建包含偏好获取和示例批评的对话推荐系统数据集。

Result: 生成了大规模开源对话推荐系统数据集，评估显示这些对话在一致性、事实性和自然性方面表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成高质量、行为一致的对话数据，为训练基于语言模型的对话推荐系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: While language models (LMs) offer great potential for conversational
recommender systems (CRSs), the paucity of public CRS data makes fine-tuning
LMs for CRSs challenging. In response, LMs as user simulators qua data
generators can be used to train LM-based CRSs, but often lack behavioral
consistency, generating utterance sequences inconsistent with those of any real
user. To address this, we develop a methodology for generating natural
dialogues that are consistent with a user's underlying state using behavior
simulators together with LM-prompting. We illustrate our approach by generating
a large, open-source CRS data set with both preference elicitation and example
critiquing. Rater evaluation on some of these dialogues shows them to exhibit
considerable consistency, factuality and naturalness.

TL;DR: 提出look-ahead Sync方法解决神经语言隐写中的tokenization歧义问题，在保持可证明安全性的同时显著提升嵌入容量，相比SyncPool方法在英语中嵌入率提升超过160%，中文中提升25%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SyncPool方法通过粗粒度同步机制解决tokenization歧义，但牺牲了嵌入容量，仅将歧义组的全部香农熵用于同步而非有效载荷嵌入。

Method: look-ahead Sync方法仅对真正不可区分的token序列进行最小化同步采样，同时策略性地保留所有其他可区分路径以最大化嵌入容量。

Result: 在英语和中文基准测试中，该方法始终接近理论容量上限，显著优于SyncPool，在较大候选池设置下表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了向实用高容量可证明安全语言隐写迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: Neural linguistic steganography aims to embed information
  into natural text while preserving statistical undetectability. A fundamental
challenge in this ffeld stems from tokenization ambiguity in modern tokenizers,
which can lead to catastrophic decoding failures. The recent method, SyncPool,
addresses this ambiguity
  by employing a coarse-grained synchronization mechanism over groups of
ambiguous candidates. However, SyncPool sacriffces embedding capacity, as it
utilizes the entire Shannon entropy of an ambiguous group solely for
synchronization rather than for payload embedding. We propose a method named
look-ahead Sync, which overcomes the capacity limitation of SyncPool while
retaining its provable security guarantees. Our approach performs minimal
synchronized sampling only on truly indistinguishable token sequences, while
strategically preserving all other discernible paths to maximize embedding
capacity. We provide theoretical proofs for the security of our method and
analyze the gap between its achievable embedding capacity and the theoretical
upper bound. Experiments on English (using Llama 3) and Chinese (using Qwen
2.5) benchmarks show that our method consistently approaches the theoretical
capacity upper bound and signiffcantly outperforms SyncPool. The improvement in
embedding rate exceeds 160% in English and 25% in Chinese, particularly in
settings with larger candidate pools. This work represents a signiffcant step
toward practical high-capacity provably secure linguistic steganography.

*Tengjun Ni,Xin Yuan,Shenghong Li,Kai Wu,Ren Ping Liu,Wei Ni,Wenjie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StepChain GraphRAG框架通过结合问题分解和广度优先搜索推理流程，在多跳问答中实现了最先进的性能，提升了准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前检索增强生成在多跳问答中面临迭代推理步骤与外部知识检索整合的挑战，需要更有效的方法来构建显式证据链。

Method: 首先构建全局索引，推理时仅将检索到的段落动态解析为知识图谱，将复杂查询分解为子问题，然后对每个子问题使用BFS遍历动态扩展相关边，组装显式证据链。

Result: 在MuSiQue、2WikiMultiHopQA和HotpotQA数据集上达到最先进的精确匹配和F1分数，平均EM提升2.57%，F1提升2.13%，在HotpotQA上获得最大增益（+4.70% EM，+3.44% F1）。

Conclusion: 该框架通过保留中间检索步骤的思维链增强了可解释性，未来工作应关注减少计算开销和解决大语言模型幻觉问题，以提升多跳问答的效率和可靠性。

Abstract: Recent progress in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has led to more
accurate and interpretable multi-hop question answering (QA). Yet, challenges
persist in integrating iterative reasoning steps with external knowledge
retrieval. To address this, we introduce StepChain GraphRAG, a framework that
unites question decomposition with a Breadth-First Search (BFS) Reasoning Flow
for enhanced multi-hop QA. Our approach first builds a global index over the
corpus; at inference time, only retrieved passages are parsed on-the-fly into a
knowledge graph, and the complex query is split into sub-questions. For each
sub-question, a BFS-based traversal dynamically expands along relevant edges,
assembling explicit evidence chains without overwhelming the language model
with superfluous context. Experiments on MuSiQue, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and HotpotQA
show that StepChain GraphRAG achieves state-of-the-art Exact Match and F1
scores. StepChain GraphRAG lifts average EM by 2.57% and F1 by 2.13% over the
SOTA method, achieving the largest gain on HotpotQA (+4.70% EM, +3.44% F1).
StepChain GraphRAG also fosters enhanced explainability by preserving the
chain-of-thought across intermediate retrieval steps. We conclude by discussing
how future work can mitigate the computational overhead and address potential
hallucinations from large language models to refine efficiency and reliability
in multi-hop QA.

TL;DR: 本文提出了两个包含语义增强的人类轨迹数据集，结合了GPS轨迹、上下文信息（停留点、移动、POI、交通方式、天气）以及LLM生成的社交媒体帖子，支持多模态语义移动分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的移动数据集缺乏语义丰富性和多模态特征，需要结合真实世界移动数据、结构化语义增强和LLM生成内容，以支持更全面的移动行为研究。

Method: 从OpenStreetMap获取公开GPS轨迹，构建包含停留点、移动、POI、推断交通方式、天气数据的上下文层，并使用LLM生成合成社交媒体帖子，提供表格和RDF两种格式。

Result: 创建了覆盖巴黎和纽约两个结构不同大城市的语义增强轨迹数据集，支持行为建模、移动预测、知识图谱构建和LLM应用等研究任务。

Conclusion: 这是首个将真实世界移动、结构化语义增强、LLM生成文本和语义网络兼容性结合的可重用框架资源，提供了开源可复现的管道支持数据集定制。

Abstract: In this resource paper, we present two publicly available datasets of
semantically enriched human trajectories, together with the pipeline to build
them. The trajectories are publicly available GPS traces retrieved from
OpenStreetMap. Each dataset includes contextual layers such as stops, moves,
points of interest (POIs), inferred transportation modes, and weather data. A
novel semantic feature is the inclusion of synthetic, realistic social media
posts generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling multimodal and
semantic mobility analysis. The datasets are available in both tabular and
Resource Description Framework (RDF) formats, supporting semantic reasoning and
FAIR data practices. They cover two structurally distinct, large cities: Paris
and New York. Our open source reproducible pipeline allows for dataset
customization, while the datasets support research tasks such as behavior
modeling, mobility prediction, knowledge graph construction, and LLM-based
applications. To our knowledge, our resource is the first to combine real-world
movement, structured semantic enrichment, LLM-generated text, and semantic web
compatibility in a reusable framework.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于检索增强生成(RAG)的系统，用于查询英国NICE临床指南，该系统通过混合嵌入机制实现高精度检索，显著提升了LLM在医疗问答中的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NICE临床指南内容庞大且复杂，在时间紧迫的医疗系统中难以有效利用，需要开发能够快速准确回答自然语言查询的系统。

Method: 采用检索增强生成(RAG)架构，结合混合嵌入机制，从10,195个文本块中检索相关信息，使用LLM生成答案。

Result: 系统检索性能优异：MRR为0.814，首块召回率81%，前10块召回率99.1%。RAG增强模型在忠实度方面提升64.7个百分点至99.5%，显著优于医疗专用模型Meditron3-8B(43%)。

Conclusion: RAG被证明是医疗领域应用生成式AI的有效、可靠且可扩展的方法，能够经济高效地访问医疗指南信息。

Abstract: This paper presents the development and evaluation of a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) system for querying the United Kingdom's National Institute
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guidelines using Large Language
Models (LLMs). The extensive length and volume of these guidelines can impede
their utilisation within a time-constrained healthcare system, a challenge this
project addresses through the creation of a system capable of providing users
with precisely matched information in response to natural language queries. The
system's retrieval architecture, composed of a hybrid embedding mechanism, was
evaluated against a database of 10,195 text chunks derived from three hundred
guidelines. It demonstrates high performance, with a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)
of 0.814, a Recall of 81% at the first chunk and of 99.1% within the top ten
retrieved chunks, when evaluated on 7901 queries.
  The most significant impact of the RAG system was observed during the
generation phase. When evaluated on a manually curated dataset of seventy
question-answer pairs, RAG-enhanced models showed substantial gains in
performance. Faithfulness, the measure of whether an answer is supported by the
source text, was increased by 64.7 percentage points to 99.5% for the
RAG-enhanced O4-Mini model and significantly outperformed the medical-focused
Meditron3-8B LLM, which scored 43%. This, combined with a perfect Context
Precision score of 1 for all RAG-enhanced models, confirms the system's ability
to prevent information fabrication by grounding its answers in relevant source
material. This study thus establishes RAG as an effective, reliable, and
scalable approach for applying generative AI in healthcare, enabling
cost-effective access to medical guidelines.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于表示和梯度的框架，用于诊断LLM中的不良行为，包括有害内容、后门攻击和知识污染等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于参数梯度的归因方法存在噪声信号和计算复杂性问题，难以有效诊断LLM不良行为的根本原因。

Method: 在模型激活空间中分析表示及其梯度，提供语义上有意义的信号，将输出与训练数据关联起来。

Result: 该方法在样本级归因方面表现优异，并能进行细粒度的token级分析，精确定位影响模型行为的特定样本和短语。

Conclusion: 该工作为理解、审计和减轻LLM相关风险提供了一个强大的诊断工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
their deployment is frequently undermined by undesirable behaviors such as
generating harmful content, factual inaccuracies, and societal biases.
Diagnosing the root causes of these failures poses a critical challenge for AI
safety. Existing attribution methods, particularly those based on parameter
gradients, often fall short due to prohibitive noisy signals and computational
complexity. In this work, we introduce a novel and efficient framework that
diagnoses a range of undesirable LLM behaviors by analyzing representation and
its gradients, which operates directly in the model's activation space to
provide a semantically meaningful signal linking outputs to their training
data. We systematically evaluate our method for tasks that include tracking
harmful content, detecting backdoor poisoning, and identifying knowledge
contamination. The results demonstrate that our approach not only excels at
sample-level attribution but also enables fine-grained token-level analysis,
precisely identifying the specific samples and phrases that causally influence
model behavior. This work provides a powerful diagnostic tool to understand,
audit, and ultimately mitigate the risks associated with LLMs. The code is

Method: 使用翻译策略将过程式证明转换为声明式形式，构建FormalML基准，涵盖优化和概率不等式等机器学习基础理论。

Result: 评估当前最先进的证明器在准确性和效率方面仍存在显著局限性。

Conclusion: 需要开发更强大的基于LLM的定理证明器来实现有效的子目标补全。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress
in formal theorem proving. Yet their ability to serve as practical assistants
for mathematicians, filling in missing steps within complex proofs, remains
underexplored. We identify this challenge as the task of subgoal completion,
where an LLM must discharge short but nontrivial proof obligations left
unresolved in a human-provided sketch. To study this problem, we introduce
FormalML, a Lean 4 benchmark built from foundational theories of machine
learning. Using a translation tactic that converts procedural proofs into
declarative form, we extract 4937 problems spanning optimization and
probability inequalities, with varying levels of difficulty. FormalML is the
first subgoal completion benchmark to combine premise retrieval and complex
research-level contexts. Evaluation of state-of-the-art provers highlights
persistent limitations in accuracy and efficiency, underscoring the need for
more capable LLM-based theorem provers for effective subgoal completion,

underserved. We present, to our knowledge, the first Kurdish STS dataset:
10,000 sentence pairs spanning formal and informal registers, each annotated
for similarity. We benchmark Sentence-BERT, multilingual BERT, and other strong
baselines, obtaining competitive results while highlighting challenges arising
from Kurdish morphology, orthographic variation, and code-mixing. The dataset

TL;DR: CRACQ是一个多维评估框架，用于评估文档在五个特质上的表现：连贯性、严谨性、适当性、完整性和质量。该框架基于特征自动评分方法，适用于多种机器生成文本，提供可解释的自动化评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法多为单一分数，缺乏对文档多维特征的细粒度分析。CRACQ旨在提供更稳定、可解释的多维度评估，超越传统自动评分系统的局限性。

Method: 基于特征自动评分方法，整合语言、语义和结构信号进行累积评估。在500份合成资助提案上训练，并与LLM作为评判者进行基准测试。

Result: 初步结果表明，CRACQ比直接使用LLM评估产生更稳定和可解释的特征级判断，但在可靠性和领域范围方面仍存在挑战。

Conclusion: CRACQ为机器生成文本提供了有效的多维度评估框架，但在实际应用中需要进一步提升可靠性和扩展领域适应性。

Abstract: This paper presents CRACQ, a multi-dimensional evaluation framework tailored
to evaluate documents across f i v e specific traits: Coherence, Rigor,
Appropriateness, Completeness, and Quality. Building on insights from
traitbased Automated Essay Scoring (AES), CRACQ expands its fo-cus beyond
essays to encompass diverse forms of machine-generated text, providing a
rubricdriven and interpretable methodology for automated evaluation. Unlike
singlescore approaches, CRACQ integrates linguistic, semantic, and structural
signals into a cumulative assessment, enabling both holistic and trait-level
analysis. Trained on 500 synthetic grant pro-posals, CRACQ was benchmarked
against an LLM-as-a-judge and further tested on both strong and weak real
applications. Preliminary results in-dicate that CRACQ produces more stable and
interpretable trait-level judgments than direct LLM evaluation, though
challenges in reliability and domain scope remain

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个集成评估的强化学习框架，用于生成长篇临床文本，通过GRPO和DocLens评估器优化事实基础和完整性，无需单独训练奖励模型或依赖人工参考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化临床文档需要与完整性和事实基础等优先事项精确对齐，现有方法依赖人工参考或单独奖励模型训练，成本高且效率低。

Method: 使用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)与DocLens评估器结合，DocLens提供基于对话的确定性奖励，通过简单的奖励门控策略优化事实基础和完整性。

Result: 该方法提高了临床笔记质量并降低了训练成本，GPT-5定性评估显示GRPO输出在事实性、完整性和简洁性方面更受偏好，遗漏和幻觉更少。

Conclusion: 该框架可扩展到实际应用，并能整合自定义目标如指南遵循或计费偏好，由于基准相对干净且基础模型已良好对齐，这些改进可能代表保守的下限。

Abstract: Automating clinical documentation with large language models requires precise
alignment with priorities such as completeness and factual grounding. We
present an evaluation-integrated reinforcement learning framework for long-form
clinical text generation that couples Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
with DocLens, a claim-level evaluator that provides deterministic,
dialogue-grounded rewards. Our method directly optimizes factual grounding and
completeness without training a separate reward model or relying on
human-authored references. Empirically, the approach improves clinical note
quality and reduces training cost via a simple reward-gating strategy. An
independent GPT-5 qualitative evaluation further supports these gains, showing
higher preference for GRPO outputs in factuality, completeness, and brevity,
with fewer omissions and hallucinations. Because the benchmarks are relatively
clean and the base model already well aligned, these improvements likely
represent a conservative lower bound. The framework is scalable to real-world
settings and can incorporate custom objectives such as guideline adherence or
billing preferences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在关键决策中应用日益广泛，确保其可靠性变得至关重要。研究旨在探索不确定性量化方法在论证性LLM框架中的集成效果，该框架基于计算论证进行可解释的决策。

Method: 通过在论证性LLMs中集成不同的LLM不确定性量化方法，并在声明验证任务上进行实验评估，同时这种实验过程本身也是评估UQ方法有效性的新方式。

Result: 实验结果表明，尽管简单，直接提示是ArgLLMs中有效的UQ策略，显著优于更复杂的方法。

Conclusion: 在论证性LLMs中，简单的直接提示不确定性量化方法比复杂方法表现更好，这为LLM可靠性保证提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Research in uncertainty quantification (UQ) for large language models (LLMs)
is increasingly important towards guaranteeing the reliability of this
groundbreaking technology. We explore the integration of LLM UQ methods in
argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs), an explainable LLM framework for decision-making
based on computational argumentation in which UQ plays a critical role. We
conduct experiments to evaluate ArgLLMs' performance on claim verification
tasks when using different LLM UQ methods, inherently performing an assessment
of the UQ methods' effectiveness. Moreover, the experimental procedure itself
is a novel way of evaluating the effectiveness of UQ methods, especially when
intricate and potentially contentious statements are present. Our results
demonstrate that, despite its simplicity, direct prompting is an effective UQ
strategy in ArgLLMs, outperforming considerably more complex approaches.

TL;DR: 本文研究了通过提示让大语言模型模拟更早知识截止点的能力，发现提示方法在直接查询时有效，但在处理因果相关但未直接询问的遗忘内容时效果不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLMs依赖预训练数据，准确预测可能反映记忆而非推理，导致对其泛化能力的高估。随着基于提示的遗忘技术出现，研究LLMs能否通过提示模拟更早知识截止点。

Method: 构建三个评估数据集来评估LLMs遗忘能力：(1)直接事实知识、(2)语义变化、(3)因果相关知识。使用提示方法模拟更早知识截止点。

Result: 结果显示，提示方法在直接查询截止日期后信息时有效，但在处理未直接询问但因果相关的遗忘内容时效果不佳。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了在将LLMs应用于时间预测任务时需要更严格的评估设置。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for temporal prediction, but
their reliance on pretraining data raises contamination concerns, as accurate
predictions on pre-cutoff test data may reflect memorization rather than
reasoning, leading to an overestimation of their generalization capability.
With the recent emergence of prompting-based unlearning techniques, a natural
question arises: Can LLMs be prompted to simulate an earlier knowledge cutoff?
In this work, we investigate the capability of prompting to simulate earlier
knowledge cutoff in LLMs. We construct three evaluation datasets to assess the
extent to which LLMs can forget (1) direct factual knowledge, (2) semantic
shifts, and (3) causally related knowledge. Results demonstrate that while
prompt-based simulated knowledge cutoffs show effectiveness when directly
queried with the information after that date, they struggle to induce
forgetting when the forgotten content is not directly asked but causally
related to the query. These findings highlight the need for more rigorous
evaluation settings when applying LLMs for temporal prediction tasks. The full

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DRIFT是一种利用真实世界用户不满意信号进行迭代偏好训练的方法，通过动态采样正样本，在多个基准测试中显著提升了模型性能，特别是在大规模模型上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的LLM部署产生了丰富的用户不满意信号（如修正、重试），但显式满意反馈稀缺。现有偏好学习方法与这种数据分布不匹配，依赖昂贵的人工标注或假设有充足的正样本。

Method: DRIFT方法以真实世界的不满意信号为基础，从不断演进的策略中动态采样正样本进行训练，避免梯度退化并保持偏好边界。

Result: 在WildBench任务得分上提升+6.23%(7B)/+7.61%(14B)，在AlpacaEval2胜率上提升+8.95%(7B)/+12.29%(14B)，14B模型在WildBench上超越GPT-4o-mini，同时保持了探索能力，产生更多样化的高奖励解决方案。

Conclusion: DRIFT是一种有效且可扩展的后训练方法，能够充分利用现实世界中最丰富和最有信息量的信号，为真实世界LLM部署提供了实用的训练方案。

Abstract: Real-world large language model deployments (e.g., conversational AI systems,
code generation assistants) naturally generate abundant implicit user
dissatisfaction (DSAT) signals, as users iterate toward better answers through
refinements, corrections, and expressed preferences, while explicit
satisfaction (SAT) feedback is scarce. Existing preference learning approaches
are poorly aligned with this data profile, as they rely on costly human
annotations or assume plentiful positive responses. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{DRIFT} (\textbf{D}issatisfaction-\textbf{R}efined \textbf{I}terative
pre\textbf{F}erence \textbf{T}raining), which anchors training on real-world
DSAT signals and samples positives dynamically from the evolving policy.
Empirically, DRIFT models trained on real-world \textit{WildFeedback} datasets
and synthetic \textit{UltraFeedback} datasets achieve up to +6.23\% (7B) /
+7.61\% (14B) on WildBench Task Score and up to +8.95\% (7B) / +12.29\% (14B)
on AlpacaEval2 win rate over base models, outperforming strong baseline methods
such as iterative DPO and SPIN. At larger scales, the improvements are
particularly pronounced: 14B models trained with DRIFT surpass GPT-4o-mini on
WildBench. Further analysis shows that DRIFT also preserves exploratory
capacity, yielding more diverse high-reward solutions rather than collapsing to
narrow subsets. Theoretically, we demonstrate that this design preserves
preference margins and avoids the gradient degeneration. These results show
that DRIFT is an effective and scalable recipe for real-world post-training
that leverages the most abundant and informative signal. The code and data are
available at https://github.com/cacayaya/DRIFT.git.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏用于微调和评估LLM作为社交媒体代理的标准化数据资源，需要解决这一空白。

Method: 提出SIMPACT框架，将下一动作预测作为训练任务，使用聚类方法将匿名用户聚合为行为角色，构建包含12种互动类型的大规模数据集。

Result: 开发了Blueprint数据集，基于Bluesky政治话语数据，保护隐私的同时捕获真实参与模式，为社交媒体模拟提供标准化评估基准。

Conclusion: SIMPACT为推进严谨、符合伦理的社交媒体模拟提供了基础，Blueprint可作为政治话语建模的评估基准和领域特定数据集的模板。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for simulating
social media dynamics at scale, enabling studies that would be ethically or
logistically challenging with human subjects. However, the field lacks
standardized data resources for fine-tuning and evaluating LLMs as realistic
social media agents. We address this gap by introducing SIMPACT, the
SIMulation-oriented Persona and Action Capture Toolkit, a privacy respecting
framework for constructing behaviorally-grounded social media datasets suitable
for training agent models. We formulate next-action prediction as a task for
training and evaluating LLM-based agents and introduce metrics at both the
cluster and population levels to assess behavioral fidelity and stylistic
realism. As a concrete implementation, we release BluePrint, a large-scale
dataset built from public Bluesky data focused on political discourse.
BluePrint clusters anonymized users into personas of aggregated behaviours,
capturing authentic engagement patterns while safeguarding privacy through
pseudonymization and removal of personally identifiable information. The
dataset includes a sizable action set of 12 social media interaction types
(likes, replies, reposts, etc.), each instance tied to the posting activity
preceding it. This supports the development of agents that use
context-dependence, not only in the language, but also in the interaction
behaviours of social media to model social media users. By standardizing data
and evaluation protocols, SIMPACT provides a foundation for advancing rigorous,
ethically responsible social media simulations. BluePrint serves as both an
evaluation benchmark for political discourse modeling and a template for
building domain specific datasets to study challenges such as misinformation
and polarization.

Abstract: The adoption of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) in education
is still emerging. In this study, we explore the development and evaluation of
AI teaching assistants that provide curriculum-based guidance using a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline applied to selected open-source
small language models (SLMs). We benchmarked eight SLMs, including LLaMA 3.1,
IBM Granite 3.3, and Gemma 3 (7-17B parameters), against GPT-4o. Our findings
show that with proper prompting and targeted retrieval, SLMs can match LLMs in
delivering accurate, pedagogically aligned responses. Importantly, SLMs offer
significant sustainability benefits due to their lower computational and energy
requirements, enabling real-time use on consumer-grade hardware without
depending on cloud infrastructure. This makes them not only cost-effective and
privacy-preserving but also environmentally responsible, positioning them as
viable AI teaching assistants for educational institutions aiming to scale
personalized learning in a sustainable and energy-efficient manner.

Method: 包含三个主要阶段：伪并行嵌入向量的初步匹配、变换拟合和迭代优化，最终得到线性变换映射。

Result: mini-vec2vec在效率上比原始vec2vec高出数个数量级，同时匹配或超过了其性能结果。

Conclusion: 该方法具有稳定性和可解释的算法步骤，便于扩展，为在新领域和领域中的采用开辟了新机会。

Abstract: We build upon vec2vec, a procedure designed to align text embedding spaces
without parallel data. vec2vec finds a near-perfect alignment, but it is
expensive and unstable. We present mini-vec2vec, a simple and efficient
alternative that requires substantially lower computational cost and is highly
robust. Moreover, the learned mapping is a linear transformation. Our method
consists of three main stages: a tentative matching of pseudo-parallel
embedding vectors, transformation fitting, and iterative refinement. Our linear
alternative exceeds the original instantiation of vec2vec by orders of
magnitude in efficiency, while matching or exceeding their results. The
method's stability and interpretable algorithmic steps facilitate scaling and
unlock new opportunities for adoption in new domains and fields.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMSQL是对WikiSQL数据集的系统性修订和转换，旨在解决原数据集的结构和标注问题，为LLM时代提供更清洁的自然语言问题到SQL查询的基准数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WikiSQL数据集在早期NL2SQL研究中发挥了关键作用，但由于存在大小写敏感性不一致、数据类型不匹配、语法错误和未回答问题等结构性和标注问题，其使用率已下降。需要为现代LLM提供更清洁、更可靠的基准数据集。

Method: 对WikiSQL中的错误进行分类，并实施自动化的清理和重新标注方法。将原始WikiSQL转换为LLMSQL，提供清洁的自然语言问题和完整的SQL查询作为纯文本。

Result: 创建了LLMSQL数据集，并在多个大型语言模型（包括Gemma 3、LLaMA 3.2、Mistral 7B等）上进行了评估，验证了改进效果。

Conclusion: LLMSQL作为LLM就绪的基准数据集，不同于为指针网络模型设计的原始WikiSQL，它提供了清洁的自然语言问题和完整的SQL查询，便于现代自然语言到SQL模型进行直接生成和评估。

Abstract: Converting natural language questions into SQL queries (Text-to-SQL) enables
non-expert users to interact with relational databases and has long been a
central task for natural language interfaces to data. While the WikiSQL dataset
played a key role in early NL2SQL research, its usage has declined due to
structural and annotation issues, including case sensitivity inconsistencies,
data type mismatches, syntax errors, and unanswered questions. We present
LLMSQL, a systematic revision and transformation of WikiSQL designed for the
LLM era. We classify these errors and implement automated methods for cleaning
and re-annotation. To assess the impact of these improvements, we evaluated
multiple large language models (LLMs), including Gemma 3, LLaMA 3.2, Mistral
7B, gpt-oss 20B, Phi-3.5 Mini, Qwen 2.5, OpenAI o4-mini, DeepSeek R1 and
others. Rather than serving as an update, LLMSQL is introduced as an LLM-ready
benchmark: unlike the original WikiSQL, tailored for pointer-network models
selecting tokens from input, LLMSQL provides clean natural language questions
and full SQL queries as plain text, enabling straightforward generation and
evaluation for modern natural language-to-SQL models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探索LLMs在采用特定政治和文化视角时如何评估政治话语中的冒犯性，发现具有显式推理能力的大模型在意识形态和文化差异方面表现更一致和敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在不同政治和文化视角下评估冒犯性的能力，探索模型如何适应不同意识形态和语言背景的文本分类。

Method: 使用MD-Agreement数据集中2020年美国选举推文的多语言子集，评估多个LLMs从不同政治人物视角（极右、保守、中立、进步）判断推文冒犯性。

Result: 具有显式推理能力的大模型（如DeepSeek-R1、o4-mini）在意识形态和文化差异方面表现更一致和敏感，而小模型往往无法捕捉细微差别。

Conclusion: 推理能力显著提高了冒犯性判断的个性化和可解释性，表明这种机制对于使LLMs适应跨语言和意识形态的复杂社会政治文本分类至关重要。

Abstract: We explore how large language models (LLMs) assess offensiveness in political
discourse when prompted to adopt specific political and cultural perspectives.
Using a multilingual subset of the MD-Agreement dataset centered on tweets from
the 2020 US elections, we evaluate several recent LLMs - including DeepSeek-R1,
o4-mini, GPT-4.1-mini, Qwen3, Gemma, and Mistral - tasked with judging tweets
as offensive or non-offensive from the viewpoints of varied political personas
(far-right, conservative, centrist, progressive) across English, Polish, and
Russian contexts. Our results show that larger models with explicit reasoning
abilities (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini) are more consistent and sensitive to
ideological and cultural variation, while smaller models often fail to capture
subtle distinctions. We find that reasoning capabilities significantly improve
both the personalization and interpretability of offensiveness judgments,
suggesting that such mechanisms are key to adapting LLMs for nuanced
sociopolitical text classification across languages and ideologies.

Motivation: 虽然LLM中的偏见已被研究，但语音对话模型中的偏见特性尚未探索。副语言特征（如年龄、性别、口音）可能影响模型输出，多轮对话可能加剧偏见，影响决策和推荐任务的公平性。

Method: 使用群体不公平分数(GUS)衡量决策偏见，基于相似性的归一化统计率(SNSR)衡量推荐偏见，评估开源模型(Qwen2.5-Omni、GLM-4-Voice)和闭源API(GPT-4o Audio、Gemini-2.5-Flash)，分析多轮对话中重复负面反馈的影响。

Result: 闭源模型总体偏见较小，开源模型对年龄和性别更敏感，推荐任务会放大跨群体差异，偏见决策在多轮对话中可能持续存在。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统研究端到端语音对话模型偏见的工作，为构建公平可靠的音频交互系统提供见解，并发布了FairDialogue数据集和评估代码以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: While biases in large language models (LLMs), such as stereotypes and
cultural tendencies in outputs, have been examined and identified, their
presence and characteristics in spoken dialogue models (SDMs) with audio input
and output remain largely unexplored. Paralinguistic features, such as age,
gender, and accent, can affect model outputs; when compounded by multi-turn
conversations, these effects may exacerbate biases, with potential implications
for fairness in decision-making and recommendation tasks. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate biases in speech LLMs and study the impact of
multi-turn dialogues with repeated negative feedback. Bias is measured using
Group Unfairness Score (GUS) for decisions and similarity-based normalized
statistics rate (SNSR) for recommendations, across both open-source models like
Qwen2.5-Omni and GLM-4-Voice, as well as closed-source APIs such as GPT-4o
Audio and Gemini-2.5-Flash. Our analysis reveals that closed-source models
generally exhibit lower bias, while open-source models are more sensitive to
age and gender, and recommendation tasks tend to amplify cross-group
disparities. We found that biased decisions may persist in multi-turn
conversations. This work provides the first systematic study of biases in
end-to-end spoken dialogue models, offering insights towards fair and reliable
audio-based interactive systems. To facilitate further research, we release the
FairDialogue dataset and evaluation code.

Motivation: 探索语言皮层中是否存在抽象的意义表征，以及这些表征与语言形式的关系。

Method: 使用视觉和语言模型建模句子神经响应，通过生成图像和释义来提取表征，并比较预测准确度。

Result: 多图像聚合和多释义平均能提高预测准确度，丰富细节的释义甚至超过原句预测，表明语言系统有更丰富的语义表征。

Conclusion: 语言皮层中存在高度抽象、形式独立的意义表征。

Abstract: The human language system represents both linguistic forms and meanings, but
the abstractness of the meaning representations remains debated. Here, we
searched for abstract representations of meaning in the language cortex by
modeling neural responses to sentences using representations from vision and
language models. When we generate images corresponding to sentences and extract
vision model embeddings, we find that aggregating across multiple generated
images yields increasingly accurate predictions of language cortex responses,
sometimes rivaling large language models. Similarly, averaging embeddings
across multiple paraphrases of a sentence improves prediction accuracy compared
to any single paraphrase. Enriching paraphrases with contextual details that
may be implicit (e.g., augmenting "I had a pancake" to include details like
"maple syrup") further increases prediction accuracy, even surpassing
predictions based on the embedding of the original sentence, suggesting that
the language system maintains richer and broader semantic representations than
language models. Together, these results demonstrate the existence of highly
abstract, form-independent meaning representations within the language cortex.

TL;DR: DiffuSpec是一个无需训练的直接替换框架，使用预训练扩散语言模型在单次前向传播中生成多令牌草稿，通过因果一致性路径搜索和自适应草稿长度控制器解决扩散模型草稿生成的特殊挑战，实现高达3倍的实时加速。


<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型规模扩大时精度提升，但自回归解码的串行特性增加了延迟。现有推测解码方法仍依赖自回归草稿器，其顺序前向传播限制了实际加速效果。

Method: 使用预训练扩散语言模型在单次前向传播中生成多令牌草稿，引入因果一致性路径搜索从令牌网格中提取左到右路径，以及自适应草稿长度控制器根据接受反馈动态调整提案大小。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，DiffuSpec实现了高达3倍的实时加速，确立了基于扩散的草稿生成作为自回归草稿器的可靠替代方案。

Conclusion: 扩散基草稿生成为推测解码提供了强大的替代方案，通过单次前向传播生成多令牌草稿，显著提升解码效率。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) scale up, accuracy improves, but the
autoregressive (AR) nature of decoding increases latency since each token
requires a serial forward pass. Speculative decoding addresses this by
employing a fast drafter to propose multi-token drafts, which are then verified
in parallel by the target model. However, many deployments still rely on AR
drafters, where sequential passes limit wall-clock gains. We revisit the
drafting stage and present DiffuSpec, a training-free drop-in framework that
uses a pretrained diffusion language model (DLM) to produce multi-token drafts
in a single forward pass, while remaining compatible with standard AR
verifiers. Because DLM drafts are generated under bidirectional conditioning,
parallel per-position candidates form a token lattice in which the locally
highest-probability token at each position need not form a causal left-to-right
path. Moreover, DLM drafting requires pre-specifying a draft length, inducing a
speed-quality trade-off. To address these challenges, we introduce two
practical components: (i) a causal-consistency path search (CPS) over this
lattice that extracts a left-to-right path aligned with AR verification; and
(ii) an adaptive draft-length (ADL) controller that adjusts next proposal size
based on recent acceptance feedback and realized generated length. Across
benchmarks, DiffuSpec yields up to 3x wall-clock speedup, establishing
diffusion-based drafting as a robust alternative to autoregressive drafters for
speculative decoding.

Motivation: 空气质量改善和气候变化应对需要准确理解排放数据，但现有方法效率低下且专业知识分散，阻碍非专家获取排放信息。

Method: 基于精心策划的知识库，集成提示工程和问题补全技术，支持自然语言交互分析排放数据，包括查询可视化清单、分析来源贡献和推荐排放因子。

Conclusion: Emission-GPT的模块化可扩展架构促进了传统手动工作流程的自动化，为下一代排放清单开发和基于情景的评估提供了基础工具。

Abstract: Improving air quality and addressing climate change relies on accurate
understanding and analysis of air pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions.
However, emission-related knowledge is often fragmented and highly specialized,
while existing methods for accessing and compiling emissions data remain
inefficient. These issues hinder the ability of non-experts to interpret
emissions information, posing challenges to research and management. To address
this, we present Emission-GPT, a knowledge-enhanced large language model agent
tailored for the atmospheric emissions domain. Built on a curated knowledge
base of over 10,000 documents (including standards, reports, guidebooks, and
peer-reviewed literature), Emission-GPT integrates prompt engineering and
question completion to support accurate domain-specific question answering.
Emission-GPT also enables users to interactively analyze emissions data via
natural language, such as querying and visualizing inventories, analyzing
source contributions, and recommending emission factors for user-defined
scenarios. A case study in Guangdong Province demonstrates that Emission-GPT
can extract key insights--such as point source distributions and sectoral
trends--directly from raw data with simple prompts. Its modular and extensible
architecture facilitates automation of traditionally manual workflows,
positioning Emission-GPT as a foundational tool for next-generation emission
inventory development and scenario-based assessment.

Motivation: 沉默螺旋理论原本用于解释人类社会中的意见表达行为，但该理论不直接适用于LLM。本研究旨在探索在纯统计语言生成的LLM群体中是否会出现类似沉默螺旋的动态。

Method: 提出评估框架，系统控制'历史'和'个人特征'信号的可用性，使用趋势测试和集中度测量分析意见动态。

Result: 实验显示：历史和个人特征信号共同产生强烈的多数主导并复制沉默螺旋模式；仅历史信号导致强烈锚定效应；仅个人特征信号促进多样但不相关的意见。

Conclusion: 研究连接了计算社会学和负责任AI设计，强调需要监控和缓解LLM代理系统中出现的从众现象。

Abstract: The Spiral of Silence (SoS) theory holds that individuals with minority views
often refrain from speaking out for fear of social isolation, enabling majority
positions to dominate public discourse. When the 'agents' are large language
models (LLMs), however, the classical psychological explanation is not directly
applicable, since SoS was developed for human societies. This raises a central
question: can SoS-like dynamics nevertheless emerge from purely statistical
language generation in LLM collectives? We propose an evaluation framework for
examining SoS in LLM agents. Specifically, we consider four controlled
conditions that systematically vary the availability of 'History' and 'Persona'
signals. Opinion dynamics are assessed using trend tests such as Mann-Kendall
and Spearman's rank, along with concentration measures including kurtosis and
interquartile range. Experiments across open-source and closed-source models
show that history and persona together produce strong majority dominance and
replicate SoS patterns; history signals alone induce strong anchoring; and
persona signals alone foster diverse but uncorrelated opinions, indicating that
without historical anchoring, SoS dynamics cannot emerge. The work bridges
computational sociology and responsible AI design, highlighting the need to
monitor and mitigate emergent conformity in LLM-agent systems.

TL;DR: ChunkLLM是一个轻量级可插拔的训练框架，通过QK适配器和分块适配器解决Transformer自注意力机制的二次复杂度问题，在保持性能的同时显著提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer大模型在自然语言处理和计算机视觉中表现出色，但由于自注意力机制随输入token数量的二次复杂度导致计算效率低下。现有基于块选择和压缩的方法存在语义不完整或训练推理效率差的问题。

Method: 提出ChunkLLM框架，包含两个组件：QK适配器（用于特征压缩和分块注意力获取）和分块适配器（用于检测分块边界）。训练时冻结主干参数，仅训练适配器；推理时仅在检测到分块边界时触发块选择。

Result: 在多个长短文本基准数据集上评估，ChunkLLM在短文本基准上达到可比性能，在长上下文基准上保持98.64%性能，同时保留48.58%的KV缓存。处理120K长文本时相比原始Transformer最高加速4.48倍。

Conclusion: ChunkLLM有效解决了Transformer的计算效率问题，在保持模型性能的同时显著提升了推理速度，为长文本处理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based large models excel in natural language processing and
computer vision, but face severe computational inefficiencies due to the
self-attention's quadratic complexity with input tokens. Recently, researchers
have proposed a series of methods based on block selection and compression to
alleviate this problem, but they either have issues with semantic
incompleteness or poor training-inference efficiency. To comprehensively
address these challenges, we propose ChunkLLM, a lightweight and pluggable
training framework. Specifically, we introduce two components: QK Adapter
(Q-Adapter and K-Adapter) and Chunk Adapter. The former is attached to each
Transformer layer, serving dual purposes of feature compression and chunk
attention acquisition. The latter operates at the bottommost layer of the
model, functioning to detect chunk boundaries by leveraging contextual semantic
information. During the training phase, the parameters of the backbone remain
frozen, with only the QK Adapter and Chunk Adapter undergoing training.
Notably, we design an attention distillation method for training the QK
Adapter, which enhances the recall rate of key chunks. During the inference
phase, chunk selection is triggered exclusively when the current token is
detected as a chunk boundary, thereby accelerating model inference.
Experimental evaluations are conducted on a diverse set of long-text and
short-text benchmark datasets spanning multiple tasks. ChunkLLM not only
attains comparable performance on short-text benchmarks but also maintains
98.64% of the performance on long-context benchmarks while preserving a 48.58%
key-value cache retention rate. Particularly, ChunkLLM attains a maximum
speedup of 4.48x in comparison to the vanilla Transformer in the processing of
120K long texts.

TL;DR: 该研究通过分析多个大型语言模型对罗马尼亚历史争议问题的回答，评估了模型在不同语言和上下文中的偏见和不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 认识到历史常常通过被国家文化和意识形态影响的视角呈现，即使在大语言模型中也是如此。由于模型训练数据可能存在模糊性，导致缺乏中立性并影响用户认知。

Method: 研究分三个阶段进行：首先让LLM回答争议性问题，然后要求用数值评分方式重新回答相同问题，以验证回答预期类型对回答本身的影响。

Result: 结果显示：二元回答稳定性相对较高但不完美，且因语言而异；模型经常在不同语言或格式间改变立场；数值评分常与初始二元选择不一致；最一致的模型不一定是最准确或中立的。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型在特定语言语境下存在不一致性的倾向，强调了LLM在历史问题回答中的偏见和不稳定性问题。

Abstract: In this case study, we select a set of controversial Romanian historical
questions and ask multiple Large Language Models to answer them across
languages and contexts, in order to assess their biases. Besides being a study
mainly performed for educational purposes, the motivation also lies in the
recognition that history is often presented through altered perspectives,
primarily influenced by the culture and ideals of a state, even through large
language models. Since they are often trained on certain data sets that may
present certain ambiguities, the lack of neutrality is subsequently instilled
in users. The research process was carried out in three stages, to confirm the
idea that the type of response expected can influence, to a certain extent, the
response itself; after providing an affirmative answer to some given question,
an LLM could shift its way of thinking after being asked the same question
again, but being told to respond with a numerical value of a scale. Results
show that binary response stability is relatively high but far from perfect and
varies by language. Models often flip stance across languages or between
formats; numeric ratings frequently diverge from the initial binary choice, and
the most consistent models are not always those judged most accurate or
neutral. Our research brings to light the predisposition of models to such
inconsistencies, within a specific contextualization of the language for the
question asked.

Motivation: 现有LLM智能体主要依赖环境级手册和任务级指导，但忽略了实例级上下文(如物体位置、制作配方等可验证事实)，这导致在复杂任务中经常失败。

Method: 使用TODO森林进行引导式探索，通过轻量级的计划-执行-提取循环来自动生成高精度、可重用的上下文文档。

Result: 在TextWorld、ALFWorld和Crafter上的实验显示，ReAct在TextWorld中的平均成功率从37%提升到95%，IGE从81%提升到95%。

Conclusion: 通过将一次性探索转化为持久可重用的知识，该方法补充了现有上下文，使LLM智能体更加可靠和高效。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents typically receive two kinds of context: (i)
environment-level manuals that define interaction interfaces and global rules,
and (ii) task-level guidance or demonstrations tied to specific goals. In this
work, we identify a crucial but overlooked third type of context,
instance-level context, which consists of verifiable and reusable facts tied to
a specific environment instance, such as object locations, crafting recipes,
and local rules. We argue that the absence of instance-level context is a
common source of failure for LLM agents in complex tasks, as success often
depends not only on reasoning over global rules or task prompts but also on
making decisions based on precise and persistent facts. Acquiring such context
requires more than memorization: the challenge lies in efficiently exploring,
validating, and formatting these facts under tight interaction budgets. We
formalize this problem as Instance-Level Context Learning (ILCL) and introduce
our task-agnostic method to solve it. Our method performs a guided exploration,
using a compact TODO forest to intelligently prioritize its next actions and a
lightweight plan-act-extract loop to execute them. This process automatically
produces a high-precision context document that is reusable across many
downstream tasks and agents, thereby amortizing the initial exploration cost.
Experiments across TextWorld, ALFWorld, and Crafter demonstrate consistent
gains in both success and efficiency: for instance, ReAct's mean success rate
in TextWorld rises from 37% to 95%, while IGE improves from 81% to 95%. By
transforming one-off exploration into persistent, reusable knowledge, our
method complements existing contexts to enable more reliable and efficient LLM
agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在推理时经常面临上下文检索知识与预训练参数知识之间的冲突。目前缺乏对训练过程中知识仲裁策略形成机制的系统理解，这可能导致预训练模型产生不良的仲裁行为，浪费大量计算资源。

Method: 在合成传记语料上训练基于Transformer的语言模型，系统控制各种训练条件，包括文档内事实重复、信息不一致性和分布偏差等。

Result: 实验表明：文档内事实重复促进了参数和上下文能力的发展；包含不一致信息或分布偏差的语料训练鼓励模型开发稳健的策略来利用参数和上下文知识。

Conclusion: 信息不一致和分布偏差等非理想特性不应被视为需要移除的伪影，而是学习稳健知识仲裁的重要条件。这些发现为预训练能够和谐整合参数和上下文知识的模型提供了具体的实证指导。

Abstract: Large language models often encounter conflicts between in-context knowledge
retrieved at inference time and parametric knowledge acquired during
pretraining. Models that accept external knowledge uncritically are vulnerable
to misinformation, whereas models that adhere rigidly to parametric knowledge
fail to benefit from retrieval. Despite the widespread adoption of
retrieval-augmented generation, we still lack a systematic understanding of
what shapes knowledge-arbitration strategies during training. This gap risks
producing pretrained models with undesirable arbitration behaviors and,
consequently, wasting substantial computational resources after the pretraining
budget has already been spent. To address this problem, we present the first
controlled study of how training conditions influence models' use of in-context
and parametric knowledge, and how they arbitrate between them. We train
transformer-based language models on a synthetic biographies corpus while
systematically controlling various conditions. Our experiments reveal that
intra-document repetition of facts fosters the development of both parametric
and in-context capabilities. Moreover, training on a corpus that contains
inconsistent information or distributional skew encourages models to develop
robust strategies for leveraging parametric and in-context knowledge. Rather
than viewing these non-ideal properties as artifacts to remove, our results
indicate that they are important for learning robust arbitration. These
insights offer concrete, empirical guidance for pretraining models that
harmoniously integrate parametric and in-context knowledge.

Motivation: 现代语言模型依赖参数扩展来提升性能，但将所有世界知识压缩到参数中既没必要（每次提示只使用一小部分知识）也不实用（边缘设备内存和计算资源有限）。

Method: 采用内存增强架构和预训练策略，构建小型语言模型访问大型分层参数化内存库。在预训练和推理时提取小的上下文相关内存块并添加到模型中。

Result: 160M参数模型增强18M参数内存（从4.6B内存库提取）的性能可与参数多2倍以上的常规模型相媲美。实验将参数化内存扩展到超过21B参数，发现分层前馈内存在各种transformer架构中都能稳健工作。

Conclusion: 内存增强架构能有效解耦通用推理能力和长尾世界知识存储，为资源受限环境下的高效语言模型提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The impressive performance gains of modern language models currently rely on
scaling parameters: larger models store more world knowledge and reason better.
Yet compressing all world knowledge into parameters is unnecessary, as only a
fraction is used per prompt, and impractical for edge devices with limited
inference-time memory and compute. We address this shortcoming by a
memory-augmented architecture and a pretraining strategy aligned with existing
hardware paradigms. We introduce small language models that access large
hierarchical parametric memory banks encoding world knowledge. During
pretraining and inference, we fetch a small, context-dependent memory block and
add it to the model. Our pretraining learns to store long-tail world knowledge
in the memory parameters, while the small language model acts as an anchor
capturing common knowledge and general reasoning abilities. Through
trillion-token-scale experiments, we show significant gains: a 160M-parameters
model augmented with an 18M-parameters memory fetched from a 4.6B memory bank
obtains comparable performance to a regular model with more than 2x the
parameters. Through extensive experiments, we study the optimal type and size
of parametric memories in transformers, scaling them to over 21B parameters. We
find that our proposed hierarchical feed-forward memories work robustly across
transformer architectures, whether added during pretraining or post-hoc.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于校准对数似然分数的高效方法，从多个不同LLM中选择最佳响应，无需昂贵的外部验证器或多次采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限环境中，从多个LLM中选择最可靠响应具有挑战性，现有方法依赖昂贵的外部验证器或多次采样，而多LLM系统虽然能产生更多样化响应但往往表现不如单LLM自一致性方法。

Method: 使用校准的对数似然分数来隐式利用多个不同LLM的固有知识和置信度，以计算高效的方式选择最佳响应。

Result: 在GSM8K、MMLU（6个子集）和ARC数据集上，在辩论和非辩论设置中分别实现了约4%、3%和5%的改进。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种原则性、新颖且计算高效的选择策略，能够有效利用多LLM系统的潜力，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities, yet
selecting the most reliable response from multiple LLMs remains a challenge,
particularly in resource-constrained settings. Existing approaches often depend
on costly external verifiers, human evaluators, or self-consistency techniques
that require multiple samples from a single model. While multi-LLM systems
produce more diverse responses than single models and thus have greater
potential, they often underperform compared to single LLM self-consistency. We
propose a principled, novel and computationally efficient method to select the
best response from multiple different LLMs using a calibrated log-likelihood
score, implicitly leveraging the inherent knowledge and confidence of these
models. Our method demonstrates improvements of approx. 4%, 3%, and 5% across
both debate (multi-round LLM discussions) and non-debate (Best-of-N with
multiple LLMs) settings on GSM8K, MMLU (6 subsets), and ARC datasets
respectively.

Motivation: 现有检索增强生成系统主要依赖非结构化文档，忽视了关系数据库提供的精确、及时且高效可查询的事实信息，而数据库和文档在不同查询中具有互补优势。

Method: 采用规则驱动的路由框架：路由代理基于显式规则对候选增强路径评分并选择最合适的；规则制定专家代理使用问答反馈随时间优化规则以保持适应性；路径级元缓存重用语义相似查询的过往路由决策以降低延迟和成本。

Result: 在三个问答基准测试上的实验表明，该框架始终优于静态策略和学习路由基线，在保持适度计算成本的同时实现了更高的准确性。

Conclusion: 通过系统性地选择最适合的知识源，可以有效平衡检索增强生成系统的有效性和效率，数据库和文档的互补性为领域特定问答提供了重要价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on general
Question Answering (QA), yet they often struggle in domain-specific scenarios
where accurate and up-to-date information is required. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by enriching LLMs with external
knowledge, but existing systems primarily rely on unstructured documents, while
largely overlooking relational databases, which provide precise, timely, and
efficiently queryable factual information, serving as indispensable
infrastructure in domains such as finance, healthcare, and scientific research.
Motivated by this gap, we conduct a systematic analysis that reveals three
central observations: (i) databases and documents offer complementary strengths
across queries, (ii) naively combining both sources introduces noise and cost
without consistent accuracy gains, and (iii) selecting the most suitable source
for each query is crucial to balance effectiveness and efficiency. We further
observe that query types show consistent regularities in their alignment with
retrieval paths, suggesting that routing decisions can be effectively guided by
systematic rules that capture these patterns. Building on these insights, we
propose a rule-driven routing framework. A routing agent scores candidate
augmentation paths based on explicit rules and selects the most suitable one; a
rule-making expert agent refines the rules over time using QA feedback to
maintain adaptability; and a path-level meta-cache reuses past routing
decisions for semantically similar queries to reduce latency and cost.
Experiments on three QA benchmarks demonstrate that our framework consistently
outperforms static strategies and learned routing baselines, achieving higher
accuracy while maintaining moderate computational cost.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型的知识更新机制，解决当前评估不足、孤立和小规模的问题，研究模型是否像人类一样修改知识，以及编辑和遗忘在训练数据增加时的差异。

Method: 提出KnowledgeSmith框架，将知识编辑和机器遗忘统一为约束优化问题，开发自动数据集生成器，在多个图层次和数据规模上进行结构化干预，研究不同修改策略在模型知识中的传播。

Result: 实验显示LLMs在不同知识层次上不像人类那样更新知识，存在一致性-容量权衡，提供了关于知识传播、可塑性缩放、一致性和鲁棒性的细致洞察。

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计更可靠和可扩展的知识更新策略提供了建议，揭示了LLMs知识更新的独特特性。

Abstract: Knowledge editing and machine unlearning are two popular approaches for large
language models (LLMs) to stay up-to-date. However, the knowledge updating
mechanism of LLMs remains largely unexplored due to insufficient, isolated, and
small-scale evaluation. For instance, are LLMs similar to humans in modifying
certain knowledge? What differs editing and unlearning as training data
increases? This paper proposes KnowledgeSmith, a unified framework to
systematically understand the updating mechanism of LLMs. We first cast editing
and unlearning as instances of one constrained optimization problem. Then, we
propose an automatic dataset generator that provides structured interventions
across multiple graph levels and data scales, enabling controlled studies of
how different modification strategies propagate through model knowledge.
Extensive experiments demonstrate nuanced insights over knowledge propagation,
plasticity scaling, consistency, and robustness. For instance, our results show
that LLMs do not exhibit similar updating as humans for different levels of
knowledge, and there exists consistency-capacity trade-off. We hope our
findings can offer suggestions to the design of more reliable and scalable
strategies. Code: https://github.com/AIFrontierLab/KnowledgeSmith.git

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖不现实的临时查询特定文本提示来表达领域知识，而自然语言查询常使用领域特定词汇，需要理解这些词汇与数据库模式结构的关系。

Method: 在数据库层面关联结构化领域语句，使用子字符串匹配方法检索与用户查询相关的领域语句。

Result: 在11个现实数据库模式上评估，显示数据库级结构化领域语句比现有临时查询特定文本提示更实用准确，子字符串匹配检索方法比其他检索方法准确率显著更高。

Conclusion: 数据库层面的结构化领域语句和子字符串匹配检索方法能有效提升LLM在NL到SQL转换任务中的性能。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) for translating Natural
Language (NL) queries into SQL varies significantly across databases (DBs). NL
queries are often expressed using a domain specific vocabulary, and mapping
these to the correct SQL requires an understanding of the embedded domain
expressions, their relationship to the DB schema structure. Existing benchmarks
rely on unrealistic, ad-hoc query specific textual hints for expressing domain
knowledge. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for associating
structured domain statements at the database level. We present retrieval of
relevant structured domain statements given a user query using sub-string level
match. We evaluate on eleven realistic DB schemas covering diverse domains
across five open-source and proprietary LLMs and demonstrate that (1) DB level
structured domain statements are more practical and accurate than existing
ad-hoc query specific textual domain statements, and (2) Our sub-string match
based retrieval of relevant domain statements provides significantly higher
accuracy than other retrieval approaches.

Motivation: 探索纯文本训练的LLMs是否包含隐含的多模态规律，以及是否可以通过感官提示来激活这些潜在结构。

Method: 使用感官提示（如'看'或'听'）来引导模型，使其在预测下一个标记时表现得好像基于潜在的视觉或听觉证据。

Result: 研究结果表明，轻量级的提示工程能够可靠地激活纯文本训练LLMs中与模态相适应的表征。

Conclusion: 纯文本训练的LLMs内部表征中隐含地编码了多模态规律，通过适当的提示可以激活这些潜在结构。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained purely on text ostensibly lack any
direct perceptual experience, yet their internal representations are implicitly
shaped by multimodal regularities encoded in language. We test the hypothesis
that explicit sensory prompting can surface this latent structure, bringing a
text-only LLM into closer representational alignment with specialist vision and
audio encoders. When a sensory prompt tells the model to 'see' or 'hear', it
cues the model to resolve its next-token predictions as if they were
conditioned on latent visual or auditory evidence that is never actually
supplied. Our findings reveal that lightweight prompt engineering can reliably
activate modality-appropriate representations in purely text-trained LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于概率上下文无关文法(PCFGs)的新框架来研究语言模型的语法学习动态，发现Transformer模型与儿童学习语法的方式不同，能并行学习所有子语法结构，但在深层递归结构上存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型取得了令人印象深刻的结果，但对其学习动态知之甚少。本文旨在通过可控的PCFGs合成语言来精确研究模型如何获得语法能力。

Method: 使用PCFGs生成合成语言训练小型模型，通过控制语法复杂度、递归深度和子语法结构来研究学习动态，推导了训练损失和KL散度的递归公式。

Result: 发现Transformer模型能并行减少所有子语法的损失，子语法预训练能改善小模型的最终损失，预训练模型能发展出与语法子结构更对齐的内部表示，但模型在深层递归结构上存在困难。

Conclusion: PCFGs为研究语言模型学习动态提供了一个通用的测试平台，揭示了神经网络在表示层次语法方面的基本挑战，开辟了一个具有许多开放问题的研究方向。

Abstract: We introduce a new framework for understanding how language models acquire
syntax. While large models achieve impressive results, little is known about
their learning dynamics. Our approach starts with the observation that most
domains of interest, such as natural language syntax, coding languages,
arithmetic problems, are captured by probabilistic context-free grammars
(PCFGs). We study the learning dynamics of small models trained on synthetic
languages generated from PCFGs, enabling precise control over grammar
complexity, recursion depth, and subgrammar structure. We prove several
general, recursive formulae for the training loss and Kullback-Leibler
divergence over the subgrammar structure of a PCFG. Empirically, we find that
unlike children, who first master simple substructures before progressing to
more complex constructions, transformers reduce loss across all subgrammars in
parallel. We further show that subgrammar pretraining can improve the final
loss for smaller models, and that pretrained models develop internal
representations more aligned with the grammar's substructure. Finally, we
demonstrate that models struggle with deeper recursive structures (a limitation
even of large language models), revealing fundamental challenges in how neural
networks represent hierarchical syntax. Overall, our work initiates the study
of the learning dynamics of transformers on PCFGs as a versatile testbed for
probing learning in language models, opening a research direction with many
open questions.

Motivation: 传统评估指标难以有效捕捉现代LLM生成内容的关键特征，特别是在RAG系统中，需要更全面和敏感的评估方法。

Method: 扩展RAGAS框架为基于知识图谱的评估范式，引入多跳推理和语义社区聚类来推导更全面的评分指标。

Result: 与RAGAS分数相比，该方法在人类标注子集上显示出更好的相关性，并且对生成输出的细微语义差异更敏感。

Conclusion: 基于知识图谱的评估方法能够更深入地理解RAG系统性能，为未来研究指明了关键挑战和潜在方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) has become a significant research focus and is
utilized in various fields, such as text generation and dialog systems. One of
the most essential applications of LLM is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG),
which greatly enhances generated content's reliability and relevance. However,
evaluating RAG systems remains a challenging task. Traditional evaluation
metrics struggle to effectively capture the key features of modern
LLM-generated content that often exhibits high fluency and naturalness.
Inspired by the RAGAS tool, a well-known RAG evaluation framework, we extended
this framework into a KG-based evaluation paradigm, enabling multi-hop
reasoning and semantic community clustering to derive more comprehensive
scoring metrics. By incorporating these comprehensive evaluation criteria, we
gain a deeper understanding of RAG systems and a more nuanced perspective on
their performance. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we compare
its performance with RAGAS scores and construct a human-annotated subset to
assess the correlation between human judgments and automated metrics. In
addition, we conduct targeted experiments to demonstrate that our KG-based
evaluation method is more sensitive to subtle semantic differences in generated
outputs. Finally, we discuss the key challenges in evaluating RAG systems and
highlight potential directions for future research.

Motivation: 了解语音语言模型中关键组件模态适配器（MA）如何转换表征，因为目前对这些重要组件的工作原理知之甚少。

Method: 通过找到MA表征与解码器语言模型标记的最邻近匹配，分析三种SLM模型中MA的输出表征。

Result: 发现两种MA表征策略：使用Whisper编码器的模型采用基于英语的中介语表示输入语义，可处理未见语言；而Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct等模型则用英语单词表示输入语音。

Conclusion: MA表征策略取决于语音编码器的训练目标：仅用于语音识别或同时用于翻译。

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) that integrate speech with large language
models (LMs) rely on modality adapters (MAs) to map the output of speech
encoders to a representation that is understandable to the decoder LM. Yet we
know very little about how these crucial MAs transform representations. Here we
examine the MA output representation in three SLMs (SALMONN, Qwen2-Audio and
Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct). By finding the nearest decoder LM token to an MA
representation, we uncover two strategies for MA representations. For models
using a Whisper encoder, MAs appear to represent the meaning of the input using
an English-based interlingua, allowing them to handle languages unseen in
instruction tuning. For models that don't, like Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct, MAs
instead represent the phonetics of the input, but expressed with English words.
We hypothesise that which arises depends on whether the speech encoder is
trained only for speech recognition or also for translation.

TL;DR: 提出了首个用于评估上下文归因的高亮解释黄金标准框架，评估了四种高亮解释方法在上下文利用中的准确性，发现MechLight表现最佳但所有方法在长上下文和位置偏差方面存在挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型的上下文利用能力对用户来说是不透明的，用户无法确定模型是从参数记忆还是提供的上下文中获取信息，也无法识别哪些具体上下文片段影响了响应。高亮解释虽然能指出影响模型输出的具体上下文片段，但现有工作未评估其在准确解释上下文利用方面的有效性。

Method: 引入首个用于上下文归因的黄金标准高亮解释评估框架，使用已知真实上下文使用情况的受控测试案例。评估了四种高亮解释方法（三种现有技术和MechLight，一种为任务调整的机制可解释性方法），涵盖四种上下文场景、四个数据集和五个语言模型。

Result: MechLight在所有上下文场景中表现最佳。但所有方法在较长上下文下都表现不佳，并显示出位置偏差，表明解释准确性存在基本挑战。

Conclusion: 需要新方法来提供可靠的大规模上下文利用解释，当前的高亮解释方法在准确解释上下文归因方面仍面临根本性挑战，特别是在处理长上下文和位置偏差时。

Abstract: Context utilisation, the ability of Language Models (LMs) to incorporate
relevant information from the provided context when generating responses,
remains largely opaque to users, who cannot determine whether models draw from
parametric memory or provided context, nor identify which specific context
pieces inform the response. Highlight explanations (HEs) offer a natural
solution as they can point the exact context pieces and tokens that influenced
model outputs. However, no existing work evaluates their effectiveness in
accurately explaining context utilisation. We address this gap by introducing
the first gold standard HE evaluation framework for context attribution, using
controlled test cases with known ground-truth context usage, which avoids the
limitations of existing indirect proxy evaluations. To demonstrate the
framework's broad applicability, we evaluate four HE methods -- three
established techniques and MechLight, a mechanistic interpretability approach
we adapt for this task -- across four context scenarios, four datasets, and
five LMs. Overall, we find that MechLight performs best across all context
scenarios. However, all methods struggle with longer contexts and exhibit
positional biases, pointing to fundamental challenges in explanation accuracy
that require new approaches to deliver reliable context utilisation
explanations at scale.

Motivation: 随着LLM在客户服务中的广泛应用，需要了解用户与聊天机器人和人类客服沟通方式的差异，以改进模型训练策略。

Method: 采用两种策略：(1) 后训练阶段的数据增强；(2) 推理时用户信息重构。比较了在不同风格数据集上训练的模型性能。

Result: 在风格多样化数据集上训练的模型显著优于仅在原始或风格统一数据集上训练的模型，而推理时重构策略效果较差。

Conclusion: 为提升LLM与用户交互体验，需要在训练中考虑用户沟通风格的变化，数据增强是有效的适应策略。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in customer-facing
applications, a critical yet underexplored question is how users communicate
differently with LLM chatbots compared to human agent. In this study, we
present empirical evidence that users adopt distinct communication styles when
users interact with chatbots versus human agents. Our analysis reveals
significant differences in grammatical fluency, politeness, and lexical
diversity in user language between the two settings. These findings suggest
that models trained exclusively on human-human interaction data may not
adequately accommodate the communication style shift that occurs once an LLM
chatbot is deployed. To enhance LLM robustness to post-launch communication
style changes, we experimented with two strategies: (1) data augmentation
during the post-training phase and (2) inference-time user message
reformulation. Our results indicate that models trained on stylistically
diverse datasets significantly outperform those trained exclusively on original
or stylistically uniform datasets, while inference-time reformulation proved
less effective. These insights help us to better adapt our models for improved
LLM-user interaction experiences.

Conclusion: SoT方法能有效提升大语言模型在多语言推理任务中的性能，通过结构化表示实现跨语言推理能力的一致性。

Abstract: Recent developments have enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to engage in
complex reasoning tasks through deep thinking. However, the capacity of
reasoning has not been successfully transferred to non-high-resource languages
due to resource constraints, which struggles with multilingual reasoning tasks.
To this end, we propose Structured-of-Thought (SoT), a training-free method
that improves the performance on multilingual reasoning through a multi-step
transformation: Language Thinking Transformation and Structured Knowledge
Transformation. The SoT method converts language-specific semantic information
into language-agnostic structured representations, enabling the models to
understand the query in different languages more sophisticated. Besides, SoT
effectively guides LLMs toward more concentrated reasoning to maintain
consistent underlying reasoning pathways when handling cross-lingual variations
in expression. Experimental results demonstrate that SoT outperforms several
strong baselines on multiple multilingual reasoning benchmarks when adapting to
various backbones of LLMs. It can also be integrated with other training-free
strategies for further improvements. Our code is available at

Result: 在多个问答基准测试中，该方法在分布内和分布外设置下均显著优于现有无监督和有监督不确定性量化方法，PRR提升达13个百分点，推理开销可忽略。

Conclusion: 该方法为上下文问答任务提供了有效的认知不确定性量化框架，通过语义特征差距实现了准确的不确定性估计。

Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) research has primarily focused on closed-book
factual question answering (QA), while contextual QA remains unexplored,
despite its importance in real-world applications. In this work, we focus on UQ
for the contextual QA task and propose a theoretically grounded approach to
quantify epistemic uncertainty. We begin by introducing a task-agnostic,
token-level uncertainty measure defined as the cross-entropy between the
predictive distribution of the given model and the unknown true distribution.
By decomposing this measure, we isolate the epistemic component and approximate
the true distribution by a perfectly prompted, idealized model. We then derive
an upper bound for epistemic uncertainty and show that it can be interpreted as
semantic feature gaps in the given model's hidden representations relative to
the ideal model. We further apply this generic framework to the contextual QA
task and hypothesize that three features approximate this gap: context-reliance
(using the provided context rather than parametric knowledge), context
comprehension (extracting relevant information from context), and honesty
(avoiding intentional lies). Using a top-down interpretability approach, we
extract these features by using only a small number of labeled samples and
ensemble them to form a robust uncertainty score. Experiments on multiple QA
benchmarks in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings show that
our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised
(sampling-free and sampling-based) and supervised UQ methods, achieving up to a
13-point PRR improvement while incurring a negligible inference overhead.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次使用生存分析评估对话AI的鲁棒性，发现突发语义漂移会显著增加对话失败风险，而渐进漂移则具有保护作用，能显著延长对话持续时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估框架主要关注静态基准和单轮评估，无法捕捉真实对话中随时间变化的退化动态，需要新的方法来理解多轮对话中LLM的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用生存分析框架，包括Cox比例风险模型、加速失效时间模型和随机生存森林方法，分析了9个最先进LLM的36,951个对话轮次，将失败建模为时间到事件过程。

Result: 发现突发语义漂移会灾难性地增加对话失败风险，而渐进漂移则能显著降低失败风险并延长对话持续时间。AFT模型在区分度和校准方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: 生存分析是评估LLM鲁棒性的强大范式，为设计弹性对话代理提供了具体见解，并挑战了对话AI系统中语义一致性必要性的普遍假设。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized conversational AI, yet their
robustness in extended multi-turn dialogues remains poorly understood. Existing
evaluation frameworks focus on static benchmarks and single-turn assessments,
failing to capture the temporal dynamics of conversational degradation that
characterize real-world interactions. In this work, we present the first
comprehensive survival analysis of conversational AI robustness, analyzing
36,951 conversation turns across 9 state-of-the-art LLMs to model failure as a
time-to-event process. Our survival modeling framework-employing Cox
proportional hazards, Accelerated Failure Time, and Random Survival Forest
approaches-reveals extraordinary temporal dynamics. We find that abrupt,
prompt-to-prompt(P2P) semantic drift is catastrophic, dramatically increasing
the hazard of conversational failure. In stark contrast, gradual, cumulative
drift is highly protective, vastly reducing the failure hazard and enabling
significantly longer dialogues. AFT models with interactions demonstrate
superior performance, achieving excellent discrimination and exceptional
calibration. These findings establish survival analysis as a powerful paradigm
for evaluating LLM robustness, offer concrete insights for designing resilient
conversational agents, and challenge prevailing assumptions about the necessity
of semantic consistency in conversational AI Systems.

TL;DR: 现有LLM基准测试在低资源任务中难以有效评估模型能力，作者构建了14个旅游领域数据集，发现通用基准测试结果不足以理解模型在低资源任务中的表现，即使训练FLOPs增加，现成LLMs在复杂领域特定场景中仍会遇到性能瓶颈，推理能力对较小LLMs提升更显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM基准测试在低资源任务中难以捕捉模型能力信息，导致在这些领域难以开发有效解决方案。

Method: 使用真实场景匿名数据构建了14个旅游领域数据集，涵盖7个常见NLP任务，分析不同LLMs的性能表现。

Result: 通用基准测试结果不足以理解模型在低资源任务中的表现；即使训练FLOPs增加，现成LLMs在复杂领域特定场景中仍会遇到性能瓶颈；推理能力对较小LLMs提升更显著，使其在某些任务中成为更好的判断者。

Conclusion: 需要专门的低资源任务基准测试来准确评估LLMs能力，推理能力对较小模型有更显著的提升效果。

Abstract: Results on existing LLM benchmarks capture little information over the model
capabilities in low-resource tasks, making it difficult to develop effective
solutions in these domains. To address these challenges, we curated 14
travel-domain datasets spanning 7 common NLP tasks using anonymised data from
real-world scenarios, and analysed the performance across LLMs. We report on
the accuracy, scaling behaviour, and reasoning capabilities of LLMs in a
variety of tasks. Our results confirm that general benchmarking results are
insufficient for understanding model performance in low-resource tasks. Despite
the amount of training FLOPs, out-of-the-box LLMs hit performance bottlenecks
in complex, domain-specific scenarios. Furthermore, reasoning provides a more
significant boost for smaller LLMs by making the model a better judge on
certain tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于策略梯度的生成对抗网络PGMEL，用于多模态实体链接任务，通过生成高质量负样本来提升表示学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态实体链接方法未探索高质量负样本选择的重要性，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 在生成对抗框架下，生成器负责生成高质量负样本，判别器负责度量学习任务，使用策略梯度优化离散的生成过程。

Result: 在Wiki-MEL、Richpedia-MEL和WikiDiverse数据集上的实验表明，PGMEL通过选择具有挑战性的负样本学习有意义的表示，并优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: PGMEL方法有效解决了多模态实体链接中负样本选择问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: The task of entity linking, which involves associating mentions with their
respective entities in a knowledge graph, has received significant attention
due to its numerous potential applications. Recently, various multimodal entity
linking (MEL) techniques have been proposed, targeted to learn comprehensive
embeddings by leveraging both text and vision modalities. The selection of
high-quality negative samples can potentially play a crucial role in
metric/representation learning. However, to the best of our knowledge, this
possibility remains unexplored in existing literature within the framework of
MEL. To fill this gap, we address the multimodal entity linking problem in a
generative adversarial setting where the generator is responsible for
generating high-quality negative samples, and the discriminator is assigned the
responsibility for the metric learning tasks. Since the generator is involved
in generating samples, which is a discrete process, we optimize it using policy
gradient techniques and propose a policy gradient-based generative adversarial
network for multimodal entity linking (PGMEL). Experimental results based on
Wiki-MEL, Richpedia-MEL and WikiDiverse datasets demonstrate that PGMEL learns
meaningful representation by selecting challenging negative samples and
outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于对比学习编码器的评估框架来检测LLMs在印度文化背景下的偏见，并创建了包含2575个句子的IndiCASA数据集，发现所有模型都存在刻板印象偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在关键领域应用增多，需要严格评估其偏见，特别是在印度这样文化多样的环境中，现有基于嵌入的偏见评估方法难以捕捉细微的刻板印象。

Method: 使用对比学习训练的编码器通过嵌入相似性捕获细粒度偏见，并创建了IndiCASA数据集，涵盖种姓、性别、宗教、残疾和社会经济地位五个维度。

Result: 评估多个开源LLMs发现所有模型都存在不同程度的刻板印象偏见，其中残疾相关偏见特别持久，宗教偏见相对较低可能因全球去偏见努力。

Conclusion: 研究证明了需要更公平的模型开发，特别是在文化多样背景下检测和减轻偏见的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant traction across critical
domains owing to their impressive contextual understanding and generative
capabilities. However, their increasing deployment in high stakes applications
necessitates rigorous evaluation of embedded biases, particularly in culturally
diverse contexts like India where existing embedding-based bias assessment
methods often fall short in capturing nuanced stereotypes. We propose an
evaluation framework based on a encoder trained using contrastive learning that
captures fine-grained bias through embedding similarity. We also introduce a
novel dataset - IndiCASA (IndiBias-based Contextually Aligned Stereotypes and
Anti-stereotypes) comprising 2,575 human-validated sentences spanning five
demographic axes: caste, gender, religion, disability, and socioeconomic
status. Our evaluation of multiple open-weight LLMs reveals that all models
exhibit some degree of stereotypical bias, with disability related biases being
notably persistent, and religion bias generally lower likely due to global
debiasing efforts demonstrating the need for fairer model development.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习训练需要大量标注数据，成本高昂。本文旨在探索如何在最小化数据依赖的情况下，通过自感知机制提升LLM的推理能力。

Method: 采用自感知强化学习框架：1) 自感知难度预测 - 模型评估任务难度并优先选择具有挑战性但可解决的任务；2) 自感知极限突破 - 当任务超出能力边界时主动请求外部数据突破限制。

Result: 在9个基准测试中实现了53.8%的相对性能提升，仅需不到1.2%的额外数据，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 自感知强化学习展示了在最小数据依赖下提升LLM推理能力的潜力，为自进化智能体训练提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but such training
typically demands substantial efforts in creating and annotating data. In this
work, we explore improving LLMs through RL with minimal data. Our approach
alternates between the LLM proposing a task and then attempting to solve it. To
minimize data dependency, we introduce two novel mechanisms grounded in
self-awareness: (1) self-aware difficulty prediction, where the model learns to
assess task difficulty relative to its own abilities and prioritize challenging
yet solvable tasks, and (2) self-aware limit breaking, where the model
recognizes when a task is beyond its capability boundary and proactively
requests external data to break through that limit. Extensive experiments on
nine benchmarks showing a 53.8% relative improvement with less than 1.2% extra
data demonstrate the efficacy of self-aware RL and underscore the promise of
self-evolving agent training.

TL;DR: XTRA是一个新颖的跨语言主题建模框架，通过表示对齐和主题对齐的双重机制，在共享语义空间中实现跨语言一致的主题学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨语言主题建模方法在主题多样性方面有所改进，但难以同时保证高主题连贯性和跨语言一致性对齐。

Method: XTRA结合词袋模型和多语言嵌入，使用表示对齐（通过对比学习对齐文档-主题分布）和主题对齐（将主题-词分布投影到共享空间）的双重机制。

Result: 在多语言语料库上的实验表明，XTRA在主题连贯性、多样性和对齐质量方面显著优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: XTRA能够学习既具有可解释性（连贯且多样）又在跨语言间良好对齐的主题，为跨语言主题建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-lingual topic modeling aims to uncover shared semantic themes across
languages. Several methods have been proposed to address this problem,
leveraging both traditional and neural approaches. While previous methods have
achieved some improvements in topic diversity, they often struggle to ensure
high topic coherence and consistent alignment across languages. We propose XTRA
(Cross-Lingual Topic Modeling with Topic and Representation Alignments), a
novel framework that unifies Bag-of-Words modeling with multilingual
embeddings. XTRA introduces two core components: (1) representation alignment,
aligning document-topic distributions via contrastive learning in a shared
semantic space; and (2) topic alignment, projecting topic-word distributions
into the same space to enforce crosslingual consistency. This dual mechanism
enables XTRA to learn topics that are interpretable (coherent and diverse) and
well-aligned across languages. Experiments on multilingual corpora confirm that
XTRA significantly outperforms strong baselines in topic coherence, diversity,
and alignment quality. Code and reproducible scripts are available at https:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人格评估中面临的两个主要挑战：大型人格标注数据集的稀缺性，以及人格心理学与自然语言处理之间的脱节，这限制了模型的有效性和可解释性。

Method: 1) 从Reddit收集并创建MBTI9k和PANDORA两个数据集，整合MBTI和Big Five人格模型与人口统计信息；2) 开发SIMPA框架，使用机器学习和语义相似性匹配用户生成语句与验证问卷项目。

Result: 实验表明人口统计变量影响模型有效性。SIMPA框架能够提供与人类评估相当的人格评估结果，同时保持高可解释性和效率。

Conclusion: SIMPA框架不仅适用于人格评估，其模型无关设计、分层线索检测和可扩展性使其适用于涉及复杂标签分类学和变量线索关联的各种研究和实际应用。

Abstract: Personality refers to individual differences in behavior, thinking, and
feeling. With the growing availability of digital footprints, especially from
social media, automated methods for personality assessment have become
increasingly important. Natural language processing (NLP) enables the analysis
of unstructured text data to identify personality indicators. However, two main
challenges remain central to this thesis: the scarcity of large,
personality-labeled datasets and the disconnect between personality psychology
and NLP, which restricts model validity and interpretability. To address these
challenges, this thesis presents two datasets -- MBTI9k and PANDORA --
collected from Reddit, a platform known for user anonymity and diverse
discussions. The PANDORA dataset contains 17 million comments from over 10,000
users and integrates the MBTI and Big Five personality models with demographic
information, overcoming limitations in data size, quality, and label coverage.
Experiments on these datasets show that demographic variables influence model
validity. In response, the SIMPA (Statement-to-Item Matching Personality
Assessment) framework was developed - a computational framework for
interpretable personality assessment that matches user-generated statements
with validated questionnaire items. By using machine learning and semantic
similarity, SIMPA delivers personality assessments comparable to human
evaluations while maintaining high interpretability and efficiency. Although
focused on personality assessment, SIMPA's versatility extends beyond this
domain. Its model-agnostic design, layered cue detection, and scalability make
it suitable for various research and practical applications involving complex
label taxonomies and variable cue associations with target concepts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在生物多样性保护中的快速应用，需要系统评估其在物种评估方面的可靠性，以确定其应用边界和潜在风险。

Method: 对5个领先的LLM在21,955个物种上进行系统性验证，涵盖IUCN红色名录的四个核心评估组件：分类学、保护状态、分布和威胁。

Result: 发现关键悖论：模型在分类任务上表现优异（94.9%准确率），但在保护状态评估等推理任务上表现很差（27.2%准确率），并存在对魅力脊椎动物的系统性偏见。

Conclusion: LLM是强大的信息检索工具，但需要人类监督进行基于判断的决策，建议采用混合方法，LLM增强专家能力而人类专家保留风险评估和政策的最终决定权。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted in conservation to
address the biodiversity crisis, yet their reliability for species evaluation
is uncertain. This study systematically validates five leading models on 21,955
species across four core IUCN Red List assessment components: taxonomy,
conservation status, distribution, and threats. A critical paradox was
revealed: models excelled at taxonomic classification (94.9%) but consistently
failed at conservation reasoning (27.2% for status assessment). This
knowledge-reasoning gap, evident across all models, suggests inherent
architectural constraints, not just data limitations. Furthermore, models
exhibited systematic biases favoring charismatic vertebrates, potentially
amplifying existing conservation inequities. These findings delineate clear
boundaries for responsible LLM deployment: they are powerful tools for
information retrieval but require human oversight for judgment-based decisions.
A hybrid approach is recommended, where LLMs augment expert capacity while
human experts retain sole authority over risk assessment and policy.

TL;DR: 提出了首个完整的Wordle CSP公式化方法，引入约束感知的熵计算和概率CSP框架，在英语词汇上达到3.54次平均猜测和99.9%成功率，比现有方法提升1.7%且运行时间减少46%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Wordle求解器依赖信息论熵最大化或基于频率的启发式方法，缺乏正式的约束处理，需要开发基于约束满足问题的系统化求解方法。

Method: 引入CSP感知熵（在约束传播后计算信息增益而非原始候选集）和概率CSP框架（将贝叶斯词频先验与逻辑约束集成），通过约束恢复机制处理噪声。

Result: 在2,315个英语词上，CSP感知熵达到3.54次平均猜测和99.9%成功率；在10%噪声下保持5.3个百分点的优势；概率CSP在所有噪声水平（0-20%）下实现100%成功率；在西班牙语词汇验证中达到88%成功率且无需语言特定调优。

Conclusion: 正式CSP处理、约束感知启发式、概率-逻辑集成、鲁棒性分析和跨词典验证的组合为结构化谜题求解领域建立了新的性能基准，证明原则性约束满足技术优于经典信息论和基于学习的方法。

Abstract: Wordle presents an algorithmically rich testbed for constraint satisfaction
problem (CSP) solving. While existing solvers rely on information-theoretic
entropy maximization or frequency-based heuristics without formal constraint
treatment, we present the first comprehensive CSP formulation of Wordle with
novel constraint-aware solving strategies. We introduce CSP-Aware Entropy,
computing information gain after constraint propagation rather than on raw
candidate sets, and a Probabilistic CSP framework integrating Bayesian
word-frequency priors with logical constraints. Through evaluation on 2,315
English words, CSP-Aware Entropy achieves 3.54 average guesses with 99.9%
success rate, a statistically significant 1.7% improvement over Forward
Checking (t=-4.82, p<0.001, Cohen's d=0.07) with 46% faster runtime (12.9ms
versus 23.7ms per guess). Under 10% noise, CSP-aware approaches maintain 5.3
percentage point advantages (29.0% versus 23.7%, p=0.041), while Probabilistic
CSP achieves 100% success across all noise levels (0-20%) through constraint
recovery mechanisms. Cross-lexicon validation on 500 Spanish words demonstrates
88% success with zero language-specific tuning, validating that core CSP
principles transfer across languages despite an 11.2 percentage point gap from
linguistic differences (p<0.001, Fisher's exact test). Our open-source
implementation with 34 unit tests achieving 91% code coverage provides
reproducible infrastructure for CSP research. The combination of formal CSP
treatment, constraint-aware heuristics, probabilistic-logical integration,
robustness analysis, and cross-lexicon validation establishes new performance
benchmarks demonstrating that principled constraint satisfaction techniques
outperform classical information-theoretic and learning-based approaches for
structured puzzle-solving domains.

TL;DR: SRGen是一个轻量级的测试时框架，通过在不确定点进行自我反思来改进LLM的推理能力，无需昂贵训练即可实现自我修正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自反思方法要么对整个草稿进行修订，要么通过昂贵训练学习自校正，都是被动且低效的。需要一种更主动、高效的自我反思机制来防止早期错误传播。

Method: 使用动态熵阈值识别高不确定性token，为每个识别到的token训练特定的校正向量，利用已生成上下文进行自反思维生成来修正token概率分布。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，SRGen显著提升模型推理能力，在AIME2024上使DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B的Pass@1提升12.0%，Cons@5提升13.3%。

Conclusion: SRGen是一个即插即用的方法，将反思集成到生成过程中，实现可靠的LLM推理，以有限的开销获得一致增益，并能与其他训练时和测试时技术组合使用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly solve complex reasoning tasks via
long chain-of-thought, but their forward-only autoregressive generation process
is fragile; early token errors can cascade, which creates a clear need for
self-reflection mechanisms. However, existing self-reflection either performs
revisions over full drafts or learns self-correction via expensive training,
both fundamentally reactive and inefficient. To address this, we propose
Self-Reflective Generation at Test Time (SRGen), a lightweight test-time
framework that reflects before generating at uncertain points. During token
generation, SRGen utilizes dynamic entropy thresholding to identify
high-uncertainty tokens. For each identified token, it trains a specific
corrective vector, which fully exploits the already generated context for a
self-reflective generation to correct the token probability distribution. By
retrospectively analyzing the partial output, this self-reflection enables more
trustworthy decisions, thereby significantly reducing the probability of errors
at highly uncertain points. Evaluated on challenging mathematical reasoning
benchmarks and a diverse set of LLMs, SRGen can consistently strengthen model
reasoning: improvements in single-pass quality also translate into stronger
self-consistency voting. Especially, on AIME2024 with
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, SRGen yields absolute improvements of +12.0% on
Pass@1 and +13.3% on Cons@5. Moreover, our findings position SRGen as a
plug-and-play method that integrates reflection into the generation process for
reliable LLM reasoning, achieving consistent gains with bounded overhead and
broad composability with other training-time (e.g., RLHF) and test-time (e.g.,
SLOT) techniques.

TL;DR: TRACE是一个实用的黑盒检测框架，用于检测LLM微调中是否使用了受版权保护的数据集。它通过无失真水印和熵门控程序来增强检测能力，在多种数据集和模型上都取得了显著检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在特定领域数据集上微调的增加，需要可靠的方法来防止未经授权使用受版权保护的数据。现有的成员推理攻击和数据集推理方法通常需要访问内部信号，而当前的黑盒方法依赖手工提示或干净的参考数据集，限制了实际应用。

Method: TRACE使用私钥指导的无失真水印重写数据集，保持文本质量和下游效用。在检测时，利用微调在水印数据上的放射性效应，引入熵门控程序选择性评分高不确定性标记，大幅增强检测能力。

Result: 在多种数据集和模型系列上，TRACE始终实现显著检测（p<0.05），通常具有极强的统计证据。支持多数据集归属，即使在大规模非水印语料库上继续预训练后仍保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TRACE为可靠的黑盒验证受版权保护数据集使用提供了一条实用途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on smaller,
domain-specific datasets to improve downstream performance. These datasets
often contain proprietary or copyrighted material, raising the need for
reliable safeguards against unauthorized use. Existing membership inference
attacks (MIAs) and dataset-inference methods typically require access to
internal signals such as logits, while current black-box approaches often rely
on handcrafted prompts or a clean reference dataset for calibration, both of
which limit practical applicability. Watermarking is a promising alternative,
but prior techniques can degrade text quality or reduce task performance. We
propose TRACE, a practical framework for fully black-box detection of
copyrighted dataset usage in LLM fine-tuning. \texttt{TRACE} rewrites datasets
with distortion-free watermarks guided by a private key, ensuring both text
quality and downstream utility. At detection time, we exploit the radioactivity
effect of fine-tuning on watermarked data and introduce an entropy-gated
procedure that selectively scores high-uncertainty tokens, substantially
amplifying detection power. Across diverse datasets and model families, TRACE
consistently achieves significant detections (p<0.05), often with extremely
strong statistical evidence. Furthermore, it supports multi-dataset attribution
and remains robust even after continued pretraining on large non-watermarked
corpora. These results establish TRACE as a practical route to reliable
black-box verification of copyrighted dataset usage. We will make our code
available at: https://github.com/NusIoraPrivacy/TRACE.

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is essential for improving human-computer
interaction, yet its accuracy remains constrained by the complexity of
emotional nuances in speech. In this study, we distinguish between descriptive
semantics, which represents the contextual content of speech, and expressive
semantics, which reflects the speaker's emotional state. After watching
emotionally charged movie segments, we recorded audio clips of participants
describing their experiences, along with the intended emotion tags for each
clip, participants' self-rated emotional responses, and their valence/arousal
scores. Through experiments, we show that descriptive semantics align with
intended emotions, while expressive semantics correlate with evoked emotions.
Our findings inform SER applications in human-AI interaction and pave the way
for more context-aware AI systems.

*Oriol Pareras,Gerard I. Gállego,Federico Costa,Cristina España-Bonet,Javier Hernando*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统比较了在增加S2TT数据量时，Chain-of-Thought（CoT）和直接提示（Direct prompting）两种策略的表现，发现随着数据量增加，直接提示方法改善更一致，可能成为更有效的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的语音到文本翻译（S2TT）模型主要采用CoT提示策略，该方法通过先转录语音再翻译的步骤，能够利用丰富的ASR和T2TT数据集。但需要系统比较在不同S2TT数据量下CoT和直接提示策略的表现差异。

Method: 通过将ASR语料库的转录文本伪标记翻译成六种欧洲语言，在不同数据规模下训练基于LLM的S2TT系统，比较CoT和直接提示两种策略。

Result: 结果显示，随着数据量的增加，直接提示方法的改进更加一致，表明随着更大S2TT资源的创建，直接提示可能成为更有效的方法。

Conclusion: 随着S2TT数据资源的不断增加，直接提示策略相比CoT策略可能具有更好的发展潜力，应该关注直接提示方法在更大数据规模下的表现。

Abstract: Recent work on Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT) has focused on LLM-based
models, introducing the increasingly adopted Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting,
where the model is guided to first transcribe the speech and then translate it.
CoT typically outperforms direct prompting primarily because it can exploit
abundant Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Text Translation (T2TT)
datasets to explicitly model its steps. In this paper, we systematically
compare CoT and Direct prompting under increasing amounts of S2TT data. To this
end, we pseudo-label an ASR corpus by translating its transcriptions into six
European languages, and train LLM-based S2TT systems with both prompting
strategies at different data scales. Our results show that Direct improves more
consistently as the amount of data increases, suggesting that it may become a
more effective approach as larger S2TT resources are created.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Llama-EntScore方法，结合Llama 3.1和命名实体识别，用于比较放射学报告的语义差异，在准确率上优于单独使用LLM或NER方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射学报告评估对放射科医生培训至关重要，但现有大语言模型在专业医学领域应用受限，需要专门的方法来准确比较初步报告和最终报告的语义差异。

Method: 提出Llama-EntScore方法，结合Llama 3.1和命名实体识别(NER)，通过可调权重来强调或弱化特定类型的差异，生成定量相似度分数并提供解释。

Result: 该方法达到67%的精确匹配准确率和93%的±1范围内准确率，优于单独使用LLM或NER方法。

Conclusion: Llama-EntScore方法在放射学报告比较任务中表现出色，为放射科医生培训提供了有效的语义差异分析工具。

Abstract: Radiology report evaluation is a crucial part of radiologists' training and
plays a key role in ensuring diagnostic accuracy. As part of the standard
reporting workflow, a junior radiologist typically prepares a preliminary
report, which is then reviewed and edited by a senior radiologist to produce
the final report. Identifying semantic differences between preliminary and
final reports is essential for junior doctors, both as a training tool and to
help uncover gaps in clinical knowledge. While AI in radiology is a rapidly
growing field, the application of large language models (LLMs) remains
challenging due to the need for specialised domain knowledge. In this paper, we
explore the ability of LLMs to provide explainable and accurate comparisons of
reports in the radiology domain. We begin by comparing the performance of
several LLMs in comparing radiology reports. We then assess a more traditional
approach based on Named-Entity-Recognition (NER). However, both approaches
exhibit limitations in delivering accurate feedback on semantic similarity. To
address this, we propose Llama-EntScore, a semantic similarity scoring method
using a combination of Llama 3.1 and NER with tunable weights to emphasise or
de-emphasise specific types of differences. Our approach generates a
quantitative similarity score for tracking progress and also gives an
interpretation of the score that aims to offer valuable guidance in reviewing
and refining their reporting. We find our method achieves 67% exact-match
accuracy and 93% accuracy within +/- 1 when compared to radiologist-provided
ground truth scores - outperforming both LLMs and NER used independently. Code

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现CoT提示在语音到文本翻译中主要依赖转录文本而非语音信号，与级联系统行为相似，未能充分利用声学信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统S2TT系统中错误传播和无法利用声学线索的问题，探索CoT提示是否能真正克服这些限制。

Method: 通过归因分析、含噪声转录的鲁棒性评估和韵律感知测试来分析CoT行为，并尝试添加直接S2TT数据和噪声转录注入等训练干预。

Result: CoT主要依赖转录文本，几乎不利用语音信号；训练干预能提高鲁棒性和语音归因，但CoT的优势假设受到挑战。

Conclusion: 需要开发能显式整合声学信息的架构，CoT并未实现预期的语音-转录联合访问优势。

Abstract: Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT) systems built from Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Text Translation (T2TT) modules face two major
limitations: error propagation and the inability to exploit prosodic or other
acoustic cues. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has recently been introduced,
with the expectation that jointly accessing speech and transcription will
overcome these issues. Analyzing CoT through attribution methods, robustness
evaluations with corrupted transcripts, and prosody-awareness, we find that it
largely mirrors cascaded behavior, relying mainly on transcripts while barely
leveraging speech. Simple training interventions, such as adding Direct S2TT
data or noisy transcript injection, enhance robustness and increase speech
attribution. These findings challenge the assumed advantages of CoT and
highlight the need for architectures that explicitly integrate acoustic
information into translation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动文献综述生成方法输出质量不足，且缺乏与读者需求对齐的严格评估基准

Method: 构建细粒度的测验驱动评估框架，包括：从11,343篇论文和4,947篇高质量综述中选取主题；多维度指标层次（大纲质量、内容质量、非文本丰富度）；双模式评估协议（基于内容和基于测验的可回答性测试）

Result: SurveyBench有效挑战了现有LLM4Survey方法，在基于内容的评估中平均比人类水平低21%

Conclusion: SurveyBench填补了自动文献综述评估的空白，为改进方法提供了重要基准

Abstract: Academic survey writing, which distills vast literature into a coherent and
insightful narrative, remains a labor-intensive and intellectually demanding
task. While recent approaches, such as general DeepResearch agents and
survey-specialized methods, can generate surveys automatically (a.k.a.
LLM4Survey), their outputs often fall short of human standards and there lacks
a rigorous, reader-aligned benchmark for thoroughly revealing their
deficiencies. To fill the gap, we propose a fine-grained, quiz-driven
evaluation framework SurveyBench, featuring (1) typical survey topics source
from recent 11,343 arXiv papers and corresponding 4,947 high-quality surveys;
(2) a multifaceted metric hierarchy that assesses the outline quality (e.g.,
coverage breadth, logical coherence), content quality (e.g., synthesis
granularity, clarity of insights), and non-textual richness; and (3) a
dual-mode evaluation protocol that includes content-based and quiz-based
answerability tests, explicitly aligned with readers' informational needs.
Results show SurveyBench effectively challenges existing LLM4Survey approaches
(e.g., on average 21% lower than human in content-based evaluation).

Motivation: 大模型的置信度校准对于可靠部署至关重要，但在多语言情境下这一关键特性尚未得到充分探索，特别是非英语语言存在系统性校准偏差问题。

Method: 研究了6个模型家族和100多种语言的校准情况，分析模型内部表示，发现最终层受英语中心训练偏见影响，而晚期中间层提供更可靠的校准信号，提出了语言感知置信度集成(LACE)等训练免费方法。

Conclusion: 揭示了英语中心对齐的隐藏代价，通过超越最终层的方法为构建更公平可信的全球大模型提供了新路径。

Abstract: Confidence calibration, the alignment of a model's predicted confidence with
its actual accuracy, is crucial for the reliable deployment of Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, this critical property remains largely under-explored
in multilingual contexts. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale,
systematic studies of multilingual calibration across six model families and
over 100 languages, revealing that non-English languages suffer from
systematically worse calibration. To diagnose this, we investigate the model's
internal representations and find that the final layer, biased by
English-centric training, provides a poor signal for multilingual confidence.
In contrast, our layer-wise analysis uncovers a key insight that
late-intermediate layers consistently offer a more reliable and
better-calibrated signal. Building on this, we introduce a suite of
training-free methods, including Language-Aware Confidence Ensemble (LACE),
which adaptively selects an optimal ensemble of layers for each specific
language. Our study highlights the hidden costs of English-centric alignment
and offer a new path toward building more globally equitable and trustworthy
LLMs by looking beyond the final layer.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种检测AI编辑文本的方法，通过相似度度量量化AI编辑程度，并训练EditLens模型在二元和三元分类任务中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注检测完全AI生成的文本，但大量查询要求LLM编辑用户提供的文本，因此需要区分AI编辑文本与人类写作和AI生成文本。

Method: 首先使用轻量级相似度度量量化AI编辑程度，并用人类标注验证；然后以这些相似度度量作为中间监督，训练回归模型EditLens预测文本中的AI编辑量。

Result: 模型在二元分类任务中F1=94.7%，三元分类任务中F1=90.4%，达到最先进性能。通过Grammarly案例研究验证了方法的实用性。

Conclusion: AI编辑文本可以被检测，且AI对人类写作的修改程度也可以被检测，这对作者归属、教育和政策有重要意义。模型和数据集将公开以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: A significant proportion of queries to large language models ask them to edit
user-provided text, rather than generate new text from scratch. While previous
work focuses on detecting fully AI-generated text, we demonstrate that
AI-edited text is distinguishable from human-written and AI-generated text.
First, we propose using lightweight similarity metrics to quantify the
magnitude of AI editing present in a text given the original human-written text
and validate these metrics with human annotators. Using these similarity
metrics as intermediate supervision, we then train EditLens, a regression model
that predicts the amount of AI editing present within a text. Our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both binary (F1=94.7%) and ternary
(F1=90.4%) classification tasks in distinguishing human, AI, and mixed writing.
Not only do we show that AI-edited text can be detected, but also that the
degree of change made by AI to human writing can be detected, which has
implications for authorship attribution, education, and policy. Finally, as a
case study, we use our model to analyze the effects of AI-edits applied by
Grammarly, a popular writing assistance tool. To encourage further research, we
commit to publicly releasing our models and dataset.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证先前研究中大语言模型隐藏状态与fMRI大脑响应相关性的结果是否稳健，排除维度灾难、相似性度量方法、模型训练数据特异性以及位置编码等因素的影响。

Method: 通过维度降维、使用新的相似性度量方法、比较不同训练数据的模型以及分析位置编码的影响，来测试先前结果的稳健性。

Result: 发现先前结果在维度降维后仍然存在，不受维度灾难影响；使用新相似性度量方法确认了结果；相关性仅存在于基于人类语言训练的模型中；结果依赖于模型中的位置编码。

Conclusion: 研究结果证实并加强了先前关于大语言模型与大脑状态表征相似性的发现，为大语言模型的生物学合理性和可解释性提供了支持。

Abstract: Previous work has shown correlations between the hidden states of large
language models and fMRI brain responses, on language tasks. These correlations
have been taken as evidence of the representational similarity of these models
and brain states. This study tests whether these previous results are robust to
several possible concerns. Specifically this study shows: (i) that the previous
results are still found after dimensionality reduction, and thus are not
attributable to the curse of dimensionality; (ii) that previous results are
confirmed when using new measures of similarity; (iii) that correlations
between brain representations and those from models are specific to models
trained on human language; and (iv) that the results are dependent on the
presence of positional encoding in the models. These results confirm and
strengthen the results of previous research and contribute to the debate on the
biological plausibility and interpretability of state-of-the-art large language
models.

Motivation: 探索大语言模型时代下主题建模的新范式，验证是否零样本提示的LLM能够超越传统神经主题模型，检验"大多数NTMs已过时"的说法。

Method: 提出基于提示的简单实用方法：采样数据子集、使用提示生成主题和代表性文本、通过关键词匹配进行文本分配，采用零样本提示进行长文本生成。

Result: 论文系统比较了NTMs和LLMs在主题质量方面的表现，并实证检验了相关主张。

Conclusion: 研究展示了LLM作为主题建模工具的潜力，为传统主题建模方法提供了新的替代方案。

Abstract: Traditional topic models such as neural topic models rely on inference and
generation networks to learn latent topic distributions. This paper explores a
new paradigm for topic modeling in the era of large language models, framing TM
as a long-form generation task whose definition is updated in this paradigm. We
propose a simple but practical approach to implement LLM-based topic model
tasks out of the box (sample a data subset, generate topics and representative
text with our prompt, text assignment with keyword match). We then investigate
whether the long-form generation paradigm can beat NTMs via zero-shot
prompting. We conduct a systematic comparison between NTMs and LLMs in terms of
topic quality and empirically examine the claim that "a majority of NTMs are
outdated."

TL;DR: NN-Rank是一种利用多语言模型的隐藏表示和无标注目标语言数据来为跨语言迁移排序源语言的算法，在词性标注和命名实体识别任务上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖词汇和语言特征，当目标语言数据不可用时效果受限。NN-Rank旨在利用多语言模型的表示能力，仅需少量无标注目标语言数据就能有效排序源语言。

Method: 使用两个预训练多语言模型的隐藏表示，结合无标注目标语言数据，通过神经网络方法对51个源语言进行排序。实验涵盖词性标注和命名实体识别任务。

Result: 在使用领域内数据时，NN-Rank在词性标注任务上NDCG平均提升35.56，在命名实体识别任务上提升18.14。即使仅使用圣经作为领域外数据，NN-Rank仍保持竞争力。仅需25个样本就能达到全数据92.8%的NDCG效果。

Conclusion: NN-Rank通过多语言模型表示和少量无标注数据，能够有效识别最适合跨语言迁移的源语言，在数据稀缺情况下仍表现优异。

Abstract: We present NN-Rank, an algorithm for ranking source languages for
cross-lingual transfer, which leverages hidden representations from
multilingual models and unlabeled target-language data. We experiment with two
pretrained multilingual models and two tasks: part-of-speech tagging (POS) and
named entity recognition (NER). We consider 51 source languages and evaluate on
56 and 72 target languages for POS and NER, respectively. When using in-domain
data, NN-Rank beats state-of-the-art baselines that leverage lexical and
linguistic features, with average improvements of up to 35.56 NDCG for POS and
18.14 NDCG for NER. As prior approaches can fall back to language-level
features if target language data is not available, we show that NN-Rank remains
competitive using only the Bible, an out-of-domain corpus available for a large
number of languages. Ablations on the amount of unlabeled target data show
that, for subsets consisting of as few as 25 examples, NN-Rank produces
high-quality rankings which achieve 92.8% of the NDCG achieved using all
available target data for ranking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网页代理处理冗长网页内容时会饱和上下文限制、增加计算成本，并面临提示注入等安全风险。现有剪枝策略要么丢弃相关内容，要么保留无关上下文，导致次优动作预测。

Method: 利用轻量级LLM检索器从可访问性树观察中提取与任务目标最相关的行，通过剪枝噪声和无关内容实现高效推理。

Result: 在WorkArena和WebArena基准测试中，FocusAgent与强基线性能相当，同时减少观察大小超过50%。其变体显著降低了提示注入攻击成功率，包括横幅和弹窗攻击。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的针对性检索是构建高效、有效且安全的网页代理的实用且鲁棒策略。

Abstract: Web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) must process lengthy web
page observations to complete user goals; these pages often exceed tens of
thousands of tokens. This saturates context limits and increases computational
cost processing; moreover, processing full pages exposes agents to security
risks such as prompt injection. Existing pruning strategies either discard
relevant content or retain irrelevant context, leading to suboptimal action
prediction. We introduce FocusAgent, a simple yet effective approach that
leverages a lightweight LLM retriever to extract the most relevant lines from
accessibility tree (AxTree) observations, guided by task goals. By pruning
noisy and irrelevant content, FocusAgent enables efficient reasoning while
reducing vulnerability to injection attacks. Experiments on WorkArena and
WebArena benchmarks show that FocusAgent matches the performance of strong
baselines, while reducing observation size by over 50%. Furthermore, a variant
of FocusAgent significantly reduces the success rate of prompt-injection
attacks, including banner and pop-up attacks, while maintaining task success
performance in attack-free settings. Our results highlight that targeted
LLM-based retrieval is a practical and robust strategy for building web agents
that are efficient, effective, and secure.

TL;DR: 提出了Cache-to-Cache（C2C）方法，让多个大语言模型通过KV缓存直接进行语义通信，避免文本转换的信息损失和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多LLM系统通过文本通信会丢失丰富的语义信息并产生逐token生成的延迟，需要探索超越文本的通信方式。

Method: 使用神经网络投影和融合源模型的KV缓存到目标模型，通过可学习的门控机制选择受益于缓存通信的目标层。

Result: C2C比单个模型平均准确率提高8.5-10.5%，比文本通信范式高出约3.0-5.0%，同时延迟平均加速2.0倍。

Conclusion: KV缓存是LLM间通信的有效媒介，C2C实现了直接语义传输，在性能和效率上均有显著提升。

Abstract: Multi-LLM systems harness the complementary strengths of diverse Large
Language Models, achieving performance and efficiency gains unattainable by a
single model. In existing designs, LLMs communicate through text, forcing
internal representations to be transformed into output token sequences. This
process both loses rich semantic information and incurs token-by-token
generation latency. Motivated by these limitations, we ask: Can LLMs
communicate beyond text? Oracle experiments show that enriching the KV-Cache
semantics can improve response quality without increasing cache size,
supporting KV-Cache as an effective medium for inter-model communication. Thus,
we propose Cache-to-Cache (C2C), a new paradigm for direct semantic
communication between LLMs. C2C uses a neural network to project and fuse the
source model's KV-cache with that of the target model to enable direct semantic
transfer. A learnable gating mechanism selects the target layers that benefit
from cache communication. Compared with text communication, C2C utilizes the
deep, specialized semantics from both models, while avoiding explicit
intermediate text generation. Experiments show that C2C achieves 8.5-10.5%
higher average accuracy than individual models. It further outperforms the text
communication paradigm by approximately 3.0-5.0%, while delivering an average
2.0x speedup in latency. Our code is available at

TL;DR: Self-Anchor是一种新颖的提示方法，通过将推理轨迹分解为结构化计划并自动对齐模型注意力到最相关的推理步骤，解决LLM在复杂推理任务中注意力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着推理链的延长，关键的中间步骤和原始提示会被淹没在上下文中，导致注意力不足和错误。需要一种轻量级方法来引导LLM注意力，提高复杂推理任务的性能。

Method: 将推理轨迹分解为结构化计划，自动对齐模型注意力到最相关的推理步骤，使模型在生成过程中保持专注。

Result: 在六个基准测试中超越最先进的提示方法，显著缩小了"非推理"模型与专用推理模型之间的性能差距。

Conclusion: Self-Anchor有潜力使大多数LLM无需重新训练即可处理复杂推理任务，为提示方法提供了有效的注意力引导机制。

Abstract: To solve complex reasoning tasks for Large Language Models (LLMs),
prompting-based methods offer a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning. However, as reasoning chains extend, critical
intermediate steps and the original prompt will be buried in the context,
receiving insufficient attention and leading to errors. In this paper, we
propose Self-Anchor, a novel pipeline that leverages the inherent structure of
reasoning to steer LLM attention. Self-Anchor decomposes reasoning trajectories
into structured plans and automatically aligns the model's attention to the
most relevant inference steps, allowing the model to maintain focus throughout
generation. Our experiment shows that Self-Anchor outperforms SOTA prompting
methods across six benchmarks. Notably, Self-Anchor significantly reduces the
performance gap between ``non-reasoning'' models and specialized reasoning
models, with the potential to enable most LLMs to tackle complex reasoning
tasks without retraining.

Motivation: 发现奖励模型和AI评估指标两个研究领域存在分离现象，导致术语冗余和重复陷阱，希望通过领域间合作来共同解决面临的挑战。

Method: 通过广泛的文献综述分析两个领域，比较奖励模型和评估指标在特定任务上的表现，并识别可协作的研究方向。

Result: 发现评估指标在某些任务上优于奖励模型，识别出多个两个领域可以合作改进的研究主题，如偏好获取方法、避免虚假相关性和奖励黑客攻击等。

Conclusion: 奖励模型和评估指标领域应加强合作，这种协作有助于改进两个领域的方法，特别是在偏好获取、避免虚假相关性和校准感知元评估等方面。

Abstract: The emergence of reinforcement learning in post-training of large language
models has sparked significant interest in reward models. Reward models assess
the quality of sampled model outputs to generate training signals. This task is
also performed by evaluation metrics that monitor the performance of an AI
model. We find that the two research areas are mostly separate, leading to
redundant terminology and repeated pitfalls. Common challenges include
susceptibility to spurious correlations, impact on downstream reward hacking,
methods to improve data quality, and approaches to meta-evaluation. Our
position paper argues that a closer collaboration between the fields can help
overcome these issues. To that end, we show how metrics outperform reward
models on specific tasks and provide an extensive survey of the two areas.
Grounded in this survey, we point to multiple research topics in which closer
alignment can improve reward models and metrics in areas such as preference
elicitation methods, avoidance of spurious correlations and reward hacking, and
calibration-aware meta-evaluation.

*Fangzheng Tian,Debasis Ganguly,Craig Macdonald*

TL;DR: 提出一种从训练集中检索查询变体(QVs)的方法来改进查询性能预测(QPP)，通过两阶段检索机制获得更相关的查询变体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于查询变体的QPP方法使用查询扩展或非上下文嵌入生成QVs，可能导致主题漂移和幻觉问题。

Method: 从训练集(如MS MARCO)中检索目标查询的QVs，通过直接检索(1跳QVs)和基于相关文档的二次检索(2跳QVs)来提高召回率。

Result: 在TREC DL'19和DL'20上的实验显示，该方法比现有最佳生成式QV的QPP方法在MonoT5等神经排序模型上提升约20%。

Conclusion: 从训练集中检索查询变体比生成查询变体能更有效地提高查询性能预测的准确性。

Abstract: Leveraging query variants (QVs), i.e., queries with potentially similar
information needs to the target query, has been shown to improve the
effectiveness of query performance prediction (QPP) approaches. Existing
QV-based QPP methods generate QVs facilitated by either query expansion or
non-contextual embeddings, which may introduce topical drifts and
hallucinations. In this paper, we propose a method that retrieves QVs from a
training set (e.g., MS MARCO) for a given target query of QPP. To achieve a
high recall in retrieving queries with the most similar information needs as
the target query from a training set, we extend the directly retrieved QVs
(1-hop QVs) by a second retrieval using their denoted relevant documents (which

that the QPP methods with QVs retrieved by our method outperform the
best-performing existing generated-QV-based QPP approaches by as much as around
20\%, on neural ranking models like MonoT5.

Conclusion: 简单而有效的查询重构方法可以显著改善自然语言推荐系统对具有宽泛和间接用户意图查询的处理能力

Abstract: Natural Language (NL) recommender systems aim to retrieve relevant items from
free-form user queries and item descriptions. Existing systems often rely on
dense retrieval (DR), which struggles to interpret challenging queries that
express broad (e.g., "cities for youth friendly activities") or indirect (e.g.,
"cities for a high school graduation trip") user intents. While query
reformulation (QR) has been widely adopted to improve such systems, existing QR
methods tend to focus only on expanding the range of query subtopics (breadth)
or elaborating on the potential meaning of a query (depth), but not both. In
this paper, we propose EQR (Elaborative Subtopic Query Reformulation), a large
language model-based QR method that combines both breadth and depth by
generating potential query subtopics with information-rich elaborations. We
also introduce three new natural language recommendation benchmarks in travel,
hotel, and restaurant domains to establish evaluation of NL recommendation with
challenging queries. Experiments show EQR substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art QR methods in various evaluation metrics, highlighting that a
simple yet effective QR approach can significantly improve NL recommender
systems for queries with broad and indirect user intents.

Motivation: 探索在RAG系统中通过扩大检索语料库来降低对大语言模型的依赖，以解决模型规模扩大带来的成本和部署限制问题

Method: 实验研究不同规模语料库与不同规模语言模型的组合效果，分析语料扩展对RAG性能的影响

Result: 语料扩展能持续增强RAG性能，中小型生成器配合大语料库可媲美大型模型配小语料库，中型模型获益最大

Conclusion: 投资扩大语料库是增强RAG系统的有效途径，可与扩大语言模型规模相媲美，形成了语料-生成器的权衡关系

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) couples document retrieval with large
language models (LLMs). While scaling generators improves accuracy, it also
raises cost and limits deployability. We explore an orthogonal axis: enlarging
the retriever's corpus to reduce reliance on large LLMs. Experimental results
show that corpus scaling consistently strengthens RAG and can often serve as a
substitute for increasing model size, though with diminishing returns at larger
scales. Small- and mid-sized generators paired with larger corpora often rival
much larger models with smaller corpora; mid-sized models tend to gain the
most, while tiny and large models benefit less. Our analysis shows that
improvements arise primarily from increased coverage of answer-bearing
passages, while utilization efficiency remains largely unchanged. These
findings establish a principled corpus-generator trade-off: investing in larger
corpora offers an effective path to stronger RAG, often comparable to enlarging
the LLM itself.

TL;DR: OpenZL提出了一种新的压缩模型——图模型，通过模块化编解码器的有向无环图来表示压缩，实现了高压缩比和高吞吐量，解决了通用压缩器性能不足和专用压缩器部署困难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用压缩器在压缩比和资源利用率之间存在权衡，而专用压缩器虽然性能优越但部署和维护困难。需要一种既能提供高性能压缩，又易于部署和维护的新方法。

Method: 提出了压缩的图模型理论框架，将压缩表示为模块化编解码器的有向无环图。实现了OpenZL系统，将数据压缩为自描述格式，可由通用解码器解压任何配置。

Result: 实验结果显示OpenZL在各种真实数据集上比最先进的通用压缩器实现了更优的压缩比和速度。在Meta内部部署中，压缩大小和/或速度持续改进，开发时间从数月缩短到数天。

Conclusion: OpenZL代表了现代数据密集型应用中实用、可扩展和可维护数据压缩的进步，通过模块化设计和通用解码器解决了专用压缩器的部署难题。

Abstract: Research in general-purpose lossless compression over the last decade has
largely found improvements in compression ratio that come at great cost to
resource utilization and processing throughput. However, most production
workloads require high throughput and low resource utilization, so most
research systems have seen little adoption. Instead, real world improvements in
compression are increasingly often realized by building application-specific
compressors which can exploit knowledge about the structure and semantics of
the data being compressed. These systems easily outperform even the best
generic compressors, but application-specific compression schemes are not
without drawbacks. They are inherently limited in applicability and are
difficult to maintain and deploy.
  We show that these challenges can be overcome with a new way of thinking
about compression. We propose the ``graph model'' of compression, a new
theoretical framework for representing compression as a directed acyclic graph
of modular codecs. This motivates OpenZL, an implementation of this model that
compresses data into a self-describing wire format, any configuration of which
can be decompressed by a universal decoder. OpenZL's design enables rapid
development of tailored compressors with minimal code, its universal decoder
eliminates deployment lag, and its investment in a well-vetted standard
component library minimizes security risks. Experimental results demonstrate
that OpenZL achieves superior compression ratios and speeds compared to
state-of-the-art general-purpose compressors on a variety of real-world
datasets. Internal deployments at Meta have also shown consistent improvements
in size and/or speed, with development timelines reduced from months to days.
OpenZL thus represents an advance in practical, scalable, and maintainable data
compression for modern data-intensive applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于简化超体积指标的自适应多目标进化算法，用于处理不规则帕累托前沿问题，通过动态调整权重向量来改善优化结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的固定权重向量方法在处理不规则帕累托前沿（如退化、不连续、倒置等）时会导致解集分布不均匀或优化结果不佳。

Method: 基于MOEA/D框架，结合简化超体积指标评估解分布，使用R2指标动态调节权重向量更新频率，实现自适应权重调整。

Result: 实验结果表明，与六种先进算法相比，所提算法在处理不规则帕累托前沿问题时表现出高效性和有效性。

Conclusion: 该算法成功解决了不规则帕累托前沿优化问题，通过自适应权重调整机制提高了多目标优化的性能。

Abstract: For regular Pareto Fronts (PFs), such as those that are smooth, continuous,
and uniformly distributed, using fixed weight vectors is sufficient for
multi-objective optimization approaches using decomposition. However, when
encountering irregular PFs-including degenerate, disconnected, inverted, etc.
Fixed weight vectors can often cause a non-uniform distribution of the sets or
even poor optimization results. To address this issue, this study proposes an
adaptive many-objective evolutionary algorithm with a simplified hypervolume
indicator. It synthesizes indicator assessment techniques with
decomposition-based methods to facilitate self-adaptive and dynamic adjustment
of the weight vectors in many-objective optimization methods. Specifically,
based on the MOEA/D framework, it uses a simplified hypervolume indicator to
accurately assess solution distribution. Simultaneously, applying the R2
indicator (as an approximation of hypervolume) dynamically regulates the update
frequency of the weight vectors. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed algorithm is efficient and effective when compared with six
state-of-the-art algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了超越仅从静态代码训练中获得的代码理解能力，研究如何通过世界模型在计算环境中改进代码生成，特别是推理和规划能力。

Method: 在Python解释器和Docker环境中进行大量观察-行动轨迹的中期训练，并进行多任务推理强化学习，包括可验证编码、数学和多轮软件工程环境。

Result: CWM在多个基准测试中表现优异：SWE-bench Verified 65.8%、LiveCodeBench 68.6%、Math-500 96.6%、AIME 2024 76.0%。模型支持Python代码逐步执行模拟。

Conclusion: CWM为研究人员提供了探索世界模型在代码生成中应用的有力平台，展示了世界模型在代理式编码和推理方面的潜力，并发布了训练检查点以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: We release Code World Model (CWM), a 32-billion-parameter open-weights LLM,
to advance research on code generation with world models. To improve code
understanding beyond what can be learned from training on static code alone, we
mid-train CWM on a large amount of observation-action trajectories from Python
interpreter and agentic Docker environments, and perform extensive multi-task
reasoning RL in verifiable coding, math, and multi-turn software engineering
environments. With CWM, we provide a strong testbed for researchers to explore
the opportunities world modeling affords for improving code generation with
reasoning and planning in computational environments. We present first steps of
how world models can benefit agentic coding, enable step-by-step simulation of
Python code execution, and show early results of how reasoning can benefit from
the latter. CWM is a dense, decoder-only LLM trained with a context size of up
to 131k tokens. Independent of its world modeling capabilities, CWM offers
strong performance on general coding and math tasks: it reaches pass@1 scores
of 65.8% on SWE-bench Verified (with test-time scaling), 68.6% on
LiveCodeBench, 96.6% on Math-500, and 76.0% on AIME 2024. To support further

Motivation: 现有漏洞发现方法存在代码孤立分析、长上下文处理困难、粗粒度检测等问题，无法为工程师提供精确的行级定位和针对性修复指导。

Method: T2L-Agent采用多轮反馈机制，结合Agentic Trace Analyzer融合运行时证据（崩溃点、堆栈跟踪、覆盖率差异）和AST代码分块，实现迭代式精炼分析。

Result: 在T2L-ARVO基准测试中，T2L-Agent达到58.0%的检测率和54.8%的行级定位率，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架和基准测试将基于LLM的漏洞检测从粗粒度识别推向可部署、稳健的精确诊断，减少噪声并加速开源软件工作流中的修复过程。

Abstract: Large language models show promise for vulnerability discovery, yet
prevailing methods inspect code in isolation, struggle with long contexts, and
focus on coarse function- or file-level detections - offering limited
actionable guidance to engineers who need precise line-level localization and
targeted patches in real-world software development. We present T2L-Agent
(Trace-to-Line Agent), a project-level, end-to-end framework that plans its own
analysis and progressively narrows scope from modules to exact vulnerable
lines. T2L-Agent couples multi-round feedback with an Agentic Trace Analyzer
(ATA) that fuses runtime evidence - crash points, stack traces, and coverage
deltas - with AST-based code chunking, enabling iterative refinement beyond
single pass predictions and translating symptoms into actionable, line-level
diagnoses. To benchmark line-level vulnerability discovery, we introduce
T2L-ARVO, a diverse, expert-verified 50-case benchmark spanning five crash
families and real-world projects. T2L-ARVO is specifically designed to support
both coarse-grained detection and fine-grained localization, enabling rigorous
evaluation of systems that aim to move beyond file-level predictions. On
T2L-ARVO, T2L-Agent achieves up to 58.0% detection and 54.8% line-level
localization, substantially outperforming baselines. Together, the framework
and benchmark push LLM-based vulnerability detection from coarse identification
toward deployable, robust, precision diagnostics that reduce noise and
accelerate patching in open-source software workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离线偏好优化方法主要关注代码通过/失败信号，忽略了失败代码中的深层错误类型，导致LLM生成的代码仍存在编译和运行时错误。

Method: 构建错误笔记本记录失败代码中的错误类型，然后渐进式地优化LLM逐类型纠正错误，并在训练过程中自适应地重放错误类型以适应LLM不断变化的弱点。

Result: 在参数范围0.5B到34B的代码和通用LLM上进行实验，AP2O-Coder使用更少的偏好数据将代码生成性能提升了最高3%的pass@k指标。

Conclusion: AP2O-Coder通过关注深层错误类型和自适应渐进优化，有效提升了LLM的代码生成能力。

Abstract: LLMs' code generation capabilities have yielded substantial improvements in
the effectiveness of programming tasks. However, LLM-generated code still
suffers from compilation and runtime errors. Existing offline preference
optimization methods primarily focus on enhancing LLMs' coding abilities using
pass/fail signals in the preference data, overlooking the deep-level error
types in the failed codes. To address this, we propose Adaptively Progressive
Preference Optimization (AP2O) for coding (i.e., AP2O-Coder), a method that
guides LLMs adaptively and methodically to reduce code errors for code
generation. Specifically, we construct an error notebook from failed codes and
progressively optimize the LLM to correct errors type by type. Furthermore, we
adaptively replay error types to tailor to the LLM's changing weaknesses
throughout the training process. Through extensive experiments on both code and
general LLMs (Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek series) with parameters ranging from
0.5B to 34B, our AP2O-Coder improves code generation performance by up to 3% in
pass@k while using less preference data. Code: https://github.com/TsingZ0/AP2O

<details>

Motivation: 无服务器平台缺乏透明度，开发者需要依赖专家知识或经验进行资源配置决策，这使得在满足性能约束的同时实现最优资源配置成为一项复杂任务。

Method: 通过识别FaaS环境中资源配置技术的不同方面，提出了影响函数设计、配置、运行成本和性能保证的因素分类法，并对现有文献进行了分析。

Result: 提出了一个全面的资源配置研究综述，识别了现有研究空白，并为增强函数配置和推动无服务器计算更广泛采用提供了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 无服务器计算中的资源配置是一个复杂且关键的问题，需要进一步研究来优化函数配置，从而推动无服务器计算环境的更广泛应用。

Abstract: The serverless cloud computing model offers a framework where the service
provider abstracts the underlying infrastructure management from developers. In
this serverless model, FaaS provides an event-driven, function-oriented
computing service characterised by fine-grained, usage-based pricing that
eliminates cost for idle resources. Platforms like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions,
and Cloud Run Functions require developers to configure their function(s) with
minimum operational resources for its successful execution. This resource
allocation influences both the operational expense and the performance quality
of these functions. However, a noticeable lack of platform transparency forces
developers to rely on expert knowledge or experience-based ad-hoc decisions to
request desired function resources. This makes optimal resource configuration a
non-trivial task while adhering to performance constraints. Furthermore, while
commercial platforms often scale resources like CPU and network bandwidth
proportional to memory, open-source frameworks permit independent configuration
of function resources, introducing additional complexity for developers aiming
to optimise their functions. These complexities have directed researchers to
resolve developer challenges and advance towards an efficient server-less
execution model. In this article, we identify different aspects of resource
configuration techniques in FaaS settings and propose a taxonomy of factors
that influence function design, configuration, run-time cost, and performance
guarantees. We conduct an analysis of existing literature on resource
configuration to present a comprehensive review of current studies on function
configuration. We also identify existing research gaps and suggest future
research directions to enhance function configuration and strengthen the
capabilities of serverless computing environments to drive its broader
adoption.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is changing the nature of knowledge work, particularly
for Product Managers (PMs) in software development teams. While much software
engineering research has focused on developers' interactions with GenAI, there
is less understanding of how the work of PMs is evolving due to GenAI. To
address this gap, we conducted a mixed-methods study at Microsoft, a large,
multinational software company: surveying 885 PMs, analyzing telemetry data for
a subset of PMs (N=731), and interviewing a subset of 15 PMs. We contribute:
(1) PMs' current GenAI adoption rates, uses cases, and perceived benefits and
barriers and; (2) a framework capturing how PMs assess which tasks to delegate
to GenAI; (3) PMs adaptation practices for integrating GenAI into their roles
and perceptions of how their role is evolving. We end by discussing
implications on the broader GenAI workflow adoption process and software
development roles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAST工具存在大量误报问题，削弱了开发者信任并需要昂贵的人工筛选，需要一种能减少误报同时保持覆盖率的解决方案。

Method: 将静态分析器输出视为结构化合约，通过流敏感追踪、上下文证据和CWE特定知识进行丰富，然后由LLM进行裁决，结合静态分析的系统性覆盖和LLM的推理能力。

Result: 在OWASP Java基准测试中F1分数达0.912，OpenVuln数据集上达0.955，召回率和精确率均超过90%，CWE专用提示优于通用提示，推理导向的LLM表现最佳。

Conclusion: ZeroFalse为增强SAST可靠性提供了实用且可扩展的方法，支持其集成到真实的CI/CD流水线中。

Abstract: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools are integral to modern
software development, yet their adoption is undermined by excessive false
positives that weaken developer trust and demand costly manual triage. We
present ZeroFalse, a framework that integrates static analysis with large
language models (LLMs) to reduce false positives while preserving coverage.
ZeroFalse treats static analyzer outputs as structured contracts, enriching
them with flow-sensitive traces, contextual evidence, and CWE-specific
knowledge before adjudication by an LLM. This design preserves the systematic
reach of static analysis while leveraging the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.
We evaluate ZeroFalse across both benchmarks and real-world projects using ten
state-of-the-art LLMs. Our best-performing models achieve F1-scores of 0.912 on
the OWASP Java Benchmark and 0.955 on the OpenVuln dataset, maintaining recall
and precision above 90%. Results further show that CWE-specialized prompting
consistently outperforms generic prompts, and reasoning-oriented LLMs provide
the most reliable precision-recall balance. These findings position ZeroFalse
as a practical and scalable approach for enhancing the reliability of SAST and
supporting its integration into real-world CI/CD pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有微服务基准测试往往忽视架构设计、实现和部署等基础方面，导致难以在真实条件下评估自动扩缩容方法。

Method: 将多种先进的自动扩缩容方法应用于广泛使用的微服务基准测试，基于软件生命周期（架构、实现、部署）对问题进行分类，并使用Sock-Shop基准验证这些考虑因素。

Result: 忽视关键生命周期问题会降低自动扩缩容器性能，而解决这些问题能实现更稳定和高效的扩缩容。

Conclusion: 生命周期感知的工程实践对于释放微服务系统中自动扩缩容的全部潜力至关重要。

Abstract: Microservices have become the dominant architectural paradigm for building
scalable and modular cloud-native systems. However, achieving effective
auto-scaling in such systems remains a non-trivial challenge, as it depends not
only on advanced scaling techniques but also on sound design, implementation,
and deployment practices. Yet, these foundational aspects are often overlooked
in existing benchmarks, making it difficult to evaluate autoscaling methods
under realistic conditions. In this paper, we identify a set of practical
auto-scaling considerations by applying several state-of-the-art autoscaling
methods to widely used microservice benchmarks. To structure these findings, we
classify the issues based on when they arise during the software lifecycle:
Architecture, Implementation, and Deployment. The Architecture phase covers
high-level decisions such as service decomposition and inter-service
dependencies. The Implementation phase includes aspects like initialization
overhead, metrics instrumentation, and error propagation. The Deployment phase
focuses on runtime configurations such as resource limits and health checks. We
validate these considerations using the Sock-Shop benchmark and evaluate
diverse auto-scaling strategies, including threshold-based, control-theoretic,
learning-based, black-box optimization, and dependency-aware approaches. Our
findings show that overlooking key lifecycle concerns can degrade autoscaler
performance, while addressing them leads to more stable and efficient scaling.
These results underscore the importance of lifecycle-aware engineering for
unlocking the full potential of auto-scaling in microservice-based systems.

Motivation: 当前静态安全基准和红队工具无法充分识别新兴现实世界风险场景，特别是在不同越狱工具组合效应等边界条件下存在不足。

Method: 开发RedCodeAgent红队代理，包含自适应内存模块和定制工具箱，能动态选择最有效的红队工具组合，并在模拟沙盒环境中评估代码执行结果。

Result: 在多个先进代码代理、多样化风险场景和编程语言的广泛评估中，RedCodeAgent始终优于现有方法，实现更高的攻击成功率、更低的拒绝率和高效性能。

Conclusion: RedCodeAgent通过自动化和优化红队流程，实现了对代码代理的可扩展、自适应和有效的安全评估，暴露了先前未识别的安全风险。

Abstract: Code agents have gained widespread adoption due to their strong code
generation capabilities and integration with code interpreters, enabling
dynamic execution, debugging, and interactive programming capabilities. While
these advancements have streamlined complex workflows, they have also
introduced critical safety and security risks. Current static safety benchmarks
and red-teaming tools are inadequate for identifying emerging real-world risky
scenarios, as they fail to cover certain boundary conditions, such as the
combined effects of different jailbreak tools. In this work, we propose
RedCodeAgent, the first automated red-teaming agent designed to systematically
uncover vulnerabilities in diverse code agents. With an adaptive memory module,
RedCodeAgent can leverage existing jailbreak knowledge, dynamically select the
most effective red-teaming tools and tool combinations in a tailored toolbox
for a given input query, thus identifying vulnerabilities that might otherwise
be overlooked. For reliable evaluation, we develop simulated sandbox
environments to additionally evaluate the execution results of code agents,
mitigating potential biases of LLM-based judges that only rely on static code.
Through extensive evaluations across multiple state-of-the-art code agents,
diverse risky scenarios, and various programming languages, RedCodeAgent
consistently outperforms existing red-teaming methods, achieving higher attack
success rates and lower rejection rates with high efficiency. We further
validate RedCodeAgent on real-world code assistants, e.g., Cursor and Codeium,
exposing previously unidentified security risks. By automating and optimizing

*Hanlong Wan,Weili Xu,Michael Rosenberg,Jian Zhang,Aysha Siddika*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于BIM和LLM的自动化建筑规范审查框架，结合RAG和MCP代理管道，实现几何属性提取和规范验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决资源受限地区建筑官员面临的人工审查设计文档的繁重、易出错和高成本问题，利用BIM和LLM技术实现自动化规范审查。

Method: 采用代理驱动框架，集成BIM数据提取与自动化验证，使用RAG和MCP两种互补机制：直接调用COMcheck API进行确定性验证，以及基于RAG的规则条款推理。

Result: 通过案例演示验证了框架有效性，GPT-4o在效率和稳定性方面表现最佳，MCP代理管道在严谨性和可靠性上优于RAG推理管道。

Conclusion: 该研究推进了ACR研究，展示了可扩展、可互操作且生产就绪的方法，将BIM与权威规范审查工具连接起来。

Abstract: Building officials, particularly those in resource-constrained or rural
jurisdictions, face labor-intensive, error-prone, and costly manual reviews of
design documents as projects increase in size and complexity. The growing
adoption of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Large Language Models
(LLMs) presents opportunities for automated code review (ACR) solutions. This
study introduces a novel agent-driven framework that integrates BIM-based data
extraction with automated verification using both retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) and Model Context Protocol (MCP) agent pipelines. The
framework employs LLM-enabled agents to extract geometry, schedules, and system
attributes from heterogeneous file types, which are then processed for building
code checking through two complementary mechanisms: (1) direct API calls to the
US Department of Energy COMcheck engine, providing deterministic and
audit-ready outputs, and (2) RAG-based reasoning over rule provisions, enabling
flexible interpretation where coverage is incomplete or ambiguous.
  The framework was evaluated through case demonstrations, including automated
extraction of geometric attributes (such as surface area, tilt, and insulation
values), parsing of operational schedules, and validation of lighting
allowances under ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2022. Comparative performance tests
across multiple LLMs showed that GPT-4o achieved the best balance of efficiency
and stability, while smaller models exhibited inconsistencies or failures.
Results confirm that MCP agent pipelines outperform RAG reasoning pipelines in
rigor and reliability. This work advances ACR research by demonstrating a
scalable, interoperable, and production-ready approach that bridges BIM with
authoritative code review tools.

*Ali Ghanbari,Sasan Tavakkol*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: DM#是一种使用傅里叶分析加速DNN突变测试的技术，通过量化突变体行为进行聚类，只需测试代表性突变体即可推断整个簇的结果，显著减少测试成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNN突变分析成本高昂，因为需要测试大量突变体和大数据集，需要开发高效的加速方法。

Method: 利用傅里叶分析量化DNN突变体行为，基于行为相似性进行聚类，每个簇只测试一个代表性突变体，结果复用给整个簇。

Result: 在14个不同规模的DNN模型上评估，DM#平均加速28.38%，突变分数误差仅0.72%，比其他基线方法误差小11.78-114.36倍。

Conclusion: DM#能有效加速DNN突变测试，在保持高精度的同时显著减少计算成本。

Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) mutation analysis is a promising approach to
evaluating test set adequacy. Due to the large number of generated mutants that
must be tested on large datasets, mutation analysis is costly. In this paper,
we present a technique, named DM#, for accelerating DNN mutation testing using
Fourier analysis. The key insight is that DNN outputs are real-valued functions
suitable for Fourier analysis that can be leveraged to quantify mutant behavior
using only a few data points. DM# uses the quantified mutant behavior to
cluster the mutants so that the ones with similar behavior fall into the same
group. A representative from each group is then selected for testing, and the
result of the test, e.g., whether the mutant is killed or survived, is reused
for all other mutants represented by the selected mutant, obviating the need
for testing other mutants. 14 DNN models of sizes ranging from thousands to
millions of parameters, trained on different datasets, are used to evaluate DM#
and compare it to several baseline techniques. Our results provide empirical
evidence on the effectiveness of DM# in accelerating mutation testing by
28.38%, on average, at the average cost of only 0.72% error in mutation score.
Moreover, on average, DM# incurs 11.78, 15.16, and 114.36 times less mutation
score error compared to random mutant selection, boundary sample selection, and
random sample selection techniques, respectively, while generally offering
comparable speed-up.

TL;DR: AuthFix是一个基于LLM的OpenID Connect漏洞自动修复引擎，通过反例引导的修复方法，成功修复了74%的测试漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OpenID Connect虽然广泛使用，但安全漏洞导致重大经济损失，需要自动化修复方案来解决领域特定复杂性和精确故障定位的挑战。

Method: AuthFix集成三个关键组件：故障定位、补丁合成和补丁验证，采用新颖的Petri网模型检查器来确保补丁正确性。

Result: 在23个OpenID漏洞的数据集上，AuthFix成功为17个漏洞（74%）生成了正确补丁，其中大部分补丁与开发者编写的修复在语义上等价。

Conclusion: AuthFix证明了基于LLM的自动化修复方法在OpenID Connect安全漏洞修复中的有效性，能够生成高质量的补丁。

Abstract: OpenID Connect has revolutionized online authentication based on single
sign-on (SSO) by providing a secure and convenient method for accessing
multiple services with a single set of credentials. Despite its widespread
adoption, critical security bugs in OpenID Connect have resulted in significant
financial losses and security breaches, highlighting the need for robust
mitigation strategies. Automated program repair presents a promising solution
for generating candidate patches for OpenID implementations. However,
challenges such as domain-specific complexities and the necessity for precise
fault localization and patch verification must be addressed. We propose
AuthFix, a counterexample-guided repair engine leveraging LLMs for automated
OpenID bug fixing. AuthFix integrates three key components: fault localization,
patch synthesis, and patch verification. By employing a novel Petri-net-based
model checker, AuthFix ensures the correctness of patches by effectively
modeling interactions. Our evaluation on a dataset of OpenID bugs demonstrates
that AuthFix successfully generated correct patches for 17 out of 23 bugs
(74%), with a high proportion of patches semantically equivalent to
developer-written fixes.

TL;DR: C2|Q>是一个硬件无关的量子软件开发框架，通过将经典代码转换为量子可执行程序，使经典软件工程师能够更容易地使用量子计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前量子开发环境要求开发者处理软件栈的低层细节，使得经典软件工程师难以使用量子计算。

Method: 框架采用模块化软件工程原则，分为三个核心模块：编码器（问题分类、生成量子兼容格式和构建量子电路）、部署模块（生成电路并基于保真度、运行时间和成本推荐硬件）和解码器（将量子输出解释为经典解决方案）。

Result: 编码器模块完成率达93.8%，硬件推荐模块能正确选择最多56量子比特工作负载的量子设备，完整工作流处理了434个Python代码片段和100个JSON输入，完成率分别为93.8%和100%。在NISQ硬件上的案例研究中，相比手动实现减少了近40倍的工作量。

Conclusion: C2|Q>通过模块化方法成功降低了量子软件开发的门槛，使经典软件工程师能够更轻松地使用量子计算技术。

Abstract: Quantum Software Engineering (QSE) is emerging as a critical discipline to
make quantum computing accessible to a broader developer community; however,
most quantum development environments still require developers to engage with
low-level details across the software stack - including problem encoding,
circuit construction, algorithm configuration, hardware selection, and result
interpretation - making them difficult for classical software engineers to use.
To bridge this gap, we present C2|Q>: a hardware-agnostic quantum software
development framework that translates classical specifications (code) into
quantum-executable programs while preserving methodological rigor. The
framework applies modular software engineering principles by classifying the
workflow into three core modules: an encoder that classifies problems, produces
Quantum-Compatible Formats (QCFs), and constructs quantum circuits, a
deployment module that generates circuits and recommends hardware based on
fidelity, runtime, and cost, and a decoder that interprets quantum outputs into
classical solutions. In evaluation, the encoder module achieved a 93.8%
completion rate, the hardware recommendation module consistently selected the
appropriate quantum devices for workloads scaling up to 56 qubits, and the full
C2|Q>: workflow successfully processed classical specifications (434 Python
snippets and 100 JSON inputs) with completion rates of 93.8% and 100%,
respectively. For case study problems executed on publicly available NISQ
hardware, C2|Q>: reduced the required implementation effort by nearly 40X
compared to manual implementations using low-level quantum software development
kits (SDKs), with empirical runs limited to small- and medium-sized instances
consistent with current NISQ capabilities. The open-source implementation of
C2|Q>: is available at https://github.com/C2-Q/C2Q

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出一个猜想：代码表示越容易解析，模型性能越好。通过GramTrans方法将上下文无关语言转换为LL(1)类表示，实验证明解析难度与模型性能强相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究使用各种代码表示（纯文本、语法规则序列、语法树序列），但缺乏对解析难度与模型效果关系的系统性理解。

Method: 提出GramTrans方法，使用分层冲突消除算法将上下文无关语言转换为LL(1)类表示，平衡语法简单性和标记效率。

Result: 在Python和Java上使用三个代码生成模型评估，GramTrans在多个基准测试中相比基线表示带来显著改进。

Conclusion: 解析难度与模型性能强相关，支持了"表示越易解析，模型性能越好"的猜想。

Abstract: Code generation has shown great promise in assisting software development. A
fundamental yet underexplored question is how the choice of code representation
affects model performance. While existing studies employ various
representations, such as treating code as plain text, grammar rule sequences,
or syntax tree sequences, they lack a principled understanding of the
relationship between parsing difficulty and model effectiveness. This paper
proposes a conjecture: the easier a representation is to parse, the better
performance the model achieves. We formalize this idea using grammar classes,
where representations in simpler classes (e.g., LL(1)) are easier to parse.
Through a controlled experiment on a Python-based DSL, we show that parsing
difficulty strongly correlates with model performance. Motivated by this
finding, we present GramTrans, a general approach that automatically transforms
a context-free language into a representation within the LL(1) class. GramTrans
introduces a novel hierarchical conflict elimination algorithm, enabling a
flexible trade-off between syntactic simplicity and token efficiency. We
evaluate GramTrans on both Python and Java using three code generation models:
StarCoder 1B, DeepSeek-Coder 1.3B, and Qwen2.5 1.5B. Across multiple
benchmarks, GramTrans consistently delivers significant improvements over
baseline representations. Furthermore, our analysis of existing representations
reconfirms the strong alignment between parsing difficulty and model
performance, providing additional support for the conjecture.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该论文通过稀疏自编码器分解LLM表示，识别代码正确性方向，发现这些方向能可靠预测错误代码，且基础模型中学习到的代码正确性机制在指令微调后仍有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在软件开发中广泛应用，理解其内部正确性机制对于安全部署至关重要。

Method: 应用稀疏自编码器分解LLM表示，使用t统计量选择预测方向，通过分离分数从基础模型表示中确定引导方向，并通过引导、注意力分析和权重正交化分析其机制特性。

Result: 代码正确性方向能可靠预测错误代码，纠正能力虽然统计显著但涉及修复错误与保留正确代码之间的权衡。成功的代码生成依赖于关注测试用例而非问题描述。

Conclusion: 基础模型中识别的方向在指令微调后仍保持有效性，表明预训练期间学习的代码正确性机制在微调过程中被重新利用。提出了三个实际应用：提示策略应优先考虑测试示例、预测方向可作为错误警报、这些预测器可指导选择性引导。

Abstract: As Large Language Models become integral to software development, with
substantial portions of AI-suggested code entering production, understanding
their internal correctness mechanisms becomes critical for safe deployment. We
apply sparse autoencoders to decompose LLM representations, identifying
directions that correspond to code correctness. We select predictor directions
using t-statistics and steering directions through separation scores from base
model representations, then analyze their mechanistic properties through
steering, attention analysis, and weight orthogonalization. We find that code
correctness directions in LLMs reliably predict incorrect code, while
correction capabilities, though statistically significant, involve tradeoffs
between fixing errors and preserving correct code. Mechanistically, successful
code generation depends on attending to test cases rather than problem
descriptions. Moreover, directions identified in base models retain their
effectiveness after instruction-tuning, suggesting code correctness mechanisms
learned during pre-training are repurposed during fine-tuning. Our mechanistic
insights suggest three practical applications: prompting strategies should
prioritize test examples over elaborate problem descriptions, predictor
directions can serve as error alarms for developer review, and these same
predictors can guide selective steering, intervening only when errors are
anticipated to prevent the code corruption from constant steering.

TL;DR: AUTOPROBE是一种模型无关的方法，通过动态选择LLM内部最有信息量的表示来评估生成代码的正确性，在编译性、功能性和安全性评估方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预选/固定层和token位置的表示，这限制了在不同模型架构和任务间的泛化能力。需要一种更灵活的方法来动态选择最有信息量的内部表示。

Method: 使用基于注意力的机制学习隐藏状态的重要性分数，聚焦最相关特征，然后将加权表示聚合并传递给探测分类器来预测代码正确性。

Result: 在多个基准测试和代码LLM上的实验表明，AUTOPROBE始终优于基线方法。安全性评估比最先进的白盒方法高18%，编译性和功能性评估分别比其他方法高19%和111%。

Conclusion: 动态选择重要内部信号使AUTOPROBE成为评估各种LLM生成代码正确性的稳健且可泛化的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
code generation and are increasingly integrated into the software development
process. However, ensuring the correctness of LLM-generated code remains a
critical concern. Prior work has shown that the internal representations of
LLMs encode meaningful signals for assessing code correctness. Nevertheless,
the existing methods rely on representations from pre-selected/fixed layers and
token positions, which could limit its generalizability across diverse model
architectures and tasks. In this work, we introduce AUTOPROBE, a novel
model-agnostic approach that dynamically selects the most informative internal
representations for code correctness assessment. AUTOPROBE employs an
attention-based mechanism to learn importance scores for hidden states,
enabling it to focus on the most relevant features. These weighted
representations are then aggregated and passed to a probing classifier to
predict code correctness across multiple dimensions, including compilability,
functionality, and security. To evaluate the performance of AUTOPROBE, we
conduct extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and code LLMs. Our
experimental results show that AUTOPROBE consistently outperforms the
baselines. For security assessment, AUTOPROBE surpasses the state-of-the-art
white-box approach by 18%. For compilability and functionality assessment,
AUTOPROBE demonstrates its highest robustness to code complexity, with the
performance higher than the other approaches by up to 19% and 111%,
respectively. These findings highlight that dynamically selecting important
internal signals enables AUTOPROBE to serve as a robust and generalizable
solution for assessing the correctness of code generated by various LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着软件架构日益分布式和易变，诊断系统问题变得更加困难，需要处理碎片化的可观测性和更复杂的根因分析。

Method: 基于先前工作，引入三种设计模式：分布式追踪（跨服务请求流可见性）、应用指标（结构化应用性能监控）、基础设施指标（环境资源监控）。

Result: 这些模式源自行业实践和可观测性框架，为软件从业者提供指导。

Conclusion: 三种设计模式共同提升了云原生应用的可观测性，有助于系统可靠性、可维护性和根因分析。

Abstract: Observability helps ensure the reliability and maintainability of
cloud-native applications. As software architectures become increasingly
distributed and subject to change, it becomes a greater challenge to diagnose
system issues effectively, often having to deal with fragmented observability
and more difficult root cause analysis. This paper builds upon our previous
work and introduces three design patterns that address key challenges in
monitoring cloud-native applications. Distributed Tracing improves visibility
into request flows across services, aiding in latency analysis and root cause
detection, Application Metrics provides a structured approach to instrumenting
applications with meaningful performance indicators, enabling real-time
monitoring and anomaly detection, and Infrastructure Metrics focuses on
monitoring the environment in which the system is operated, helping teams
assess resource utilization, scalability, and operational health. These
patterns are derived from industry practices and observability frameworks and
aim to offer guidance for software practitioners.

Abstract: Higher education courses teaching about agile software development (ASD) have
increased in commonality as the ideas behind the Agile Manifesto became more
commonplace in the industry. However, a lot of the literature on how ASD is
applied in the classroom does not provide much actionable advice, focusing on
frameworks or even moving beyond the software development area into teaching in
an agile way. We, therefore, showcase early work on a pattern language that
focuses on teaching ASD practices to university students, which stems from our
own experiences as educators in higher education contexts. We present five
patterns, specifically focused on team and project setup phase: Capping Team
Size, Smaller Project Scope, Business Non-Critical Project, Self-assembling
Teams, and Team Chooses Topic as a starting point for developing the overall
pattern language.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于场景的方法来评估LLM生成代码的质量，通过测量代码异味并与专业编写的参考解决方案比较，识别LLM代码质量最差的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究主要关注LLM生成代码的功能正确性，而对其代码质量的研究较少，需要评估LLM在不同场景下生成的代码质量。

Method: 将测试数据集按代码主题和任务复杂度划分为不同场景，测量代码异味并与专业编写的参考解决方案比较，使用自动化测试系统对四个先进LLM（Gemini Pro、ChatGPT、Codex、Falcon）生成的Java程序进行实验。

Result: LLM生成的代码比参考解决方案有更高的代码异味发生率。Falcon表现最好（异味增加42.28%），其次是Gemini Pro（62.07%）、ChatGPT（65.05%）和Codex（84.97%）。平均异味增加63.34%，其中实现异味增加73.35%，设计异味增加21.42%。更复杂的编码任务和涉及面向对象概念的更高级主题的代码异味增加更大。

Conclusion: 在代码异味方面，LLM在各种编码任务复杂度和主题上的表现与相应场景中人工编写代码的质量高度相关，但LLM生成的代码质量明显低于人工编写的代码。

Abstract: Context: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to generate
program code. Much research has been reported on the functional correctness of
generated code, but there is far less on code quality.
  Objectives: In this study, we propose a scenario-based method of evaluating
the quality of LLM-generated code to identify the weakest scenarios in which
the quality of LLM generated code should be improved.
  Methods: The method measures code smells, an important indicator of code
quality, and compares them with a baseline formed from reference solutions of
professionally written code. The test dataset is divided into various subsets
according to the topics of the code and complexity of the coding tasks to
represent different scenarios of using LLMs for code generation. We will also
present an automated test system for this purpose and report experiments with
the Java programs generated in response to prompts given to four
state-of-the-art LLMs: Gemini Pro, ChatGPT, Codex, and Falcon.
  Results: We find that LLM-generated code has a higher incidence of code
smells compared to reference solutions. Falcon performed the least badly, with
a smell increase of 42.28%, followed by Gemini Pro (62.07%), ChatGPT (65.05%)
and finally Codex (84.97%). The average smell increase across all LLMs was
63.34%, comprising 73.35% for implementation smells and 21.42% for design
smells. We also found that the increase in code smells is greater for more
complex coding tasks and for more advanced topics, such as those involving
object-orientated concepts.
  Conclusion: In terms of code smells, LLM's performances on various coding
task complexities and topics are highly correlated to the quality of human
written code in the corresponding scenarios. However, the quality of LLM
generated code is noticeably poorer than human written code.

Abstract: As organizations increasingly transition from monolithic systems to
microservices, they aim to achieve higher availability, automatic scaling,
simplified infrastructure management, enhanced collaboration, and streamlined
deployments. However, this migration process remains largely manual and
labour-intensive. While existing literature offers various strategies for
decomposing monoliths, these approaches primarily focus on architecture-level
guidance, often overlooking the code-level challenges and dependencies that
developers must address during the migration. This article introduces a
catalogue of seven refactorings specifically designed to support the transition
to a microservices architecture with a focus on handling dependencies. The
catalogue provides developers with a systematic guide that consolidates
refactorings identified in the literature and addresses the critical gap in
systematizing the process at the code level. By offering a structured,
step-by-step approach, this work simplifies the migration process and lays the
groundwork for its potential automation, empowering developers to implement
these changes efficiently and effectively.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为状态字段覆盖的新指标，用于评估测试预言的质量，该指标衡量预言在测试执行期间可能访问的对象状态字段比例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指标要么无法为预言改进提供全面基础，要么仅适用于特定类型的预言，限制了通用性。评估预言质量对于提高测试过程整体有效性至关重要。

Method: 实现了一种静态计算状态字段覆盖指标的机制，通过分析类字段来测量预言可能访问的对象状态比例。

Result: 在涉及273个表示不变式和249,027个测试断言的实验中，状态字段覆盖与预言故障检测能力（通过变异得分衡量）强相关。

Conclusion: 状态字段覆盖是评估预言质量的合适指标，因为它与预言检测故障的能力密切相关。

Abstract: The effectiveness of testing in uncovering software defects depends not only
on the characteristics of the test inputs and how thoroughly they exercise the
software, but also on the quality of the oracles used to determine whether the
software behaves as expected. Therefore, assessing the quality of oracles is
crucial to improve the overall effectiveness of the testing process. Existing
metrics have been used for this purpose, but they either fail to provide a
comprehensive basis for guiding oracle improvement, or they are tailored to
specific types of oracles, thus limiting their generality.
  In this paper, we introduce state field coverage, a novel metric for
assessing oracle quality. This metric measures the proportion of an object's
state, as statically defined by its class fields, that an oracle may access
during test execution. The main intuition of our metric is that oracles with a
higher state field coverage are more likely to detect faults in the software
under analysis, as they inspect a larger portion of the object states to
determine whether tests pass or not.
  We implement a mechanism to statically compute the state field coverage
metric. Being statically computed, the metric is efficient and provides direct
guidance for improving test oracles by identifying state fields that remain
unexamined. We evaluate state field coverage through experiments involving 273
representation invariants and 249,027 test assertions. The results show that
state field coverage is a well-suited metric for assessing oracle quality, as
it strongly correlates with the oracles' fault-detection ability, measured by
mutation score.

TL;DR: 论文研究发现LLMs在代码任务中过度依赖命名模式而非真正理解语义结构，通过引入语义保留的混淆技术揭示了命名标识符泄露问题，并提出了ClassEval-Obf基准来更可靠地评估代码理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs如何理解程序含义，区分代码通过结构语义和人类可读命名两个通道传达信息，发现当前基准测试奖励命名模式记忆而非真正的语义推理。

Method: 引入语义保留的混淆技术，创建ClassEval-Obf基准，系统性地抑制命名线索同时保持程序行为不变。

Result: 去除命名通道严重降低意图级任务性能，在仅应依赖结构的执行任务中也观察到一致性能下降，混淆技术暴露了标识符泄露问题。

Conclusion: ClassEval-Obf基准减少了性能膨胀差距，削弱了记忆捷径，为评估LLMs的代码理解和泛化能力提供了更可靠的基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong results on code tasks, but how
they derive program meaning remains unclear. We argue that code communicates
through two channels: structural semantics, which define formal behavior, and
human-interpretable naming, which conveys intent. Removing the naming channel
severely degrades intent-level tasks such as summarization, where models
regress to line-by-line descriptions. Surprisingly, we also observe consistent
reductions on execution tasks that should depend only on structure, revealing
that current benchmarks reward memorization of naming patterns rather than
genuine semantic reasoning. To disentangle these effects, we introduce a suite
of semantics-preserving obfuscations and show that they expose identifier
leakage across both summarization and execution. Building on these insights, we
release ClassEval-Obf, an obfuscation-enhanced benchmark that systematically
suppresses naming cues while preserving behavior. Our results demonstrate that
ClassEval-Obf reduces inflated performance gaps, weakens memorization
shortcuts, and provides a more reliable basis for assessing LLMs' code
understanding and generalization.

Result: 在Google代码库的174个人工报告bug上，应用这两种策略可将成功率分别提高13和15个百分点，组合使用时提高39个百分点。在空指针异常和sanitizer报告的bug上，补丁验证也提高了平均单样本成功率。

Conclusion: 这种双策略方法为可靠、工业规模部署的自动程序修复系统提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Agentic Automated Program Repair (APR) is increasingly tackling complex,
repository-level bugs in industry, but ultimately agent-generated patches still
need to be reviewed by a human before committing them to ensure they address
the bug. Showing unlikely patches to developers can lead to substantial noise,
wasting valuable developer time and eroding trust in automated code changes. We
introduce two complementary LLM-based policies to reduce such noise: bug
abstention and patch validation policies. Bug abstention excludes bugs that the
agentic APR system is unlikely to fix. Patch validation rejects patches that
are unlikely to be a good fix for the given bug. We evaluate both policies on
three sets of bugs from Google's codebase, and their candidate patches
generated by an internal agentic APR system. On a set of 174 human-reported
bugs, removing bugs and patch trajectories rejected by our policies can raise
success rates by up to 13 percentage points and 15 percentage points,
respectively, and by up to 39 percentage points in combination. On null pointer
exceptions and sanitizer-reported bugs with machine-generated bug reports,
patch validation also improves average single-sample success rates. This
two-policy approach provides a practical path to the reliable, industrial-scale
deployment of agentic APR systems.

### [164] [Detecting Notational Errors in Digital Music Scores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02746)
*Géré Léo,Nicolas Audebert,Florent Jacquemard*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 提出自动化检测乐谱记谱错误的方法，包括节奏时间不一致和上下文错误，并在ASAP钢琴乐谱数据集上应用，发现约40%的乐谱存在至少一个记谱错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字乐谱格式通常宽松执行记谱规则，导致乐谱质量参差不齐，存在从轻微排版差异到严重记谱错误的问题，这对音乐信息提取和检索的数据质量构成重大挑战。

Method: 识别两种错误类型：i) 单个音乐元素的节奏/时间编码不一致；ii) 违反常见西方音乐记谱规则的上下文错误。使用模块化状态机实现后者，便于扩展规则。

Result: 在ASAP钢琴乐谱数据集上应用该方法，发现约40%的乐谱包含至少一个记谱错误，并手动修复了多个错误以提升数据集质量。

Conclusion: 提出的自动化错误检测方法能有效识别乐谱中的记谱错误，有助于提高音乐数据集的质量，为音乐信息处理提供更可靠的基础。

Abstract: Music scores are used to precisely store music pieces for transmission and
preservation. To represent and manipulate these complex objects, various
formats have been tailored for different use cases. While music notation
follows specific rules, digital formats usually enforce them leniently. Hence,
digital music scores widely vary in quality, due to software and format
specificity, conversion issues, and dubious user inputs. Problems range from
minor engraving discrepancies to major notation mistakes. Yet, data quality is
a major issue when dealing with musical information extraction and retrieval.
We present an automated approach to detect notational errors, aiming at
precisely localizing defects in scores. We identify two types of errors: i)
rhythm/time inconsistencies in the encoding of individual musical elements, and
ii) contextual errors, i.e. notation mistakes that break commonly accepted
musical rules. We implement the latter using a modular state machine that can
be easily extended to include rules representing the usual conventions from the
common Western music notation. Finally, we apply this error-detection method to
the piano score dataset ASAP. We highlight that around 40% of the scores
contain at least one notational error, and manually fix multiple of them to
enhance the dataset's quality.

### [165] [Deceptive Planning Exploiting Inattention Blindness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02714)
*Mustafa O. Karabag,Jesse Milzman,Ufuk Topcu*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 研究在理性疏忽和感知约束下的决策问题，分析玩家1因感知限制导致的疏忽盲点如何被玩家2利用来获取优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在具有感知约束的决策环境中，不准确的先验信念可能导致疏忽盲点，使智能体无法意识到自己的错误信念。这种认知缺陷可能被对手利用。

Method: 将感知约束建模为在线传感器选择问题，开发了基于理性疏忽的价值加权目标函数，并提出了贪婪算法进行传感器选择。同时为玩家2设计了短视决策算法来利用玩家1的信念偏差。

Result: 当玩家2不偏离预设策略时，该目标函数为期望价值损失提供了上界。玩家2通过偏离预设策略可以系统性地利用玩家1的疏忽，从而获得超过安全值的收益。

Conclusion: 感知约束下的理性疏忽会导致智能体持续选择与先验一致的传感器，这种认知偏差可以被对手系统性地利用，揭示了在信息受限环境中认知局限性的重要影响。

Abstract: We study decision-making with rational inattention in settings where agents
have perception constraints. In such settings, inaccurate prior beliefs or
models of others may lead to inattention blindness, where an agent is unaware
of its incorrect beliefs. We model this phenomenon in two-player zero-sum
stochastic games, where Player 1 has perception constraints and Player 2
deceptively deviates from its security policy presumed by Player 1 to gain an
advantage. We formulate the perception constraints as an online sensor
selection problem, develop a value-weighted objective function for sensor
selection capturing rational inattention, and propose the greedy algorithm for
selection under this monotone objective function. When Player 2 does not
deviate from the presumed policy, this objective function provides an upper
bound on the expected value loss compared to the security value where Player 1
has perfect information of the state. We then propose a myopic decision-making
algorithm for Player 2 to exploit Player 1's beliefs by deviating from the
presumed policy and, thereby, improve upon the security value. Numerical
examples illustrate how Player 1 persistently chooses sensors that are
consistent with its priors, allowing Player 2 to systematically exploit its
inattention.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了具有可达性目标的重复群体博弈，证明了这类博弈的决策问题是PSPACE完全的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究重复博弈中玩家形成任意规模群体的情况，探索是否存在统一的联盟策略使得玩家能够独立于群体规模而确保获胜。

Method: 使用代数工具，构建有限半群来总结有限区间内群体规模的策略，并通过半群中特定元素的存在性来表征获胜策略的存在性。

Result: 证明了该问题可以在多项式空间内解决，并提供了匹配的复杂度下界。

Conclusion: 具有可达性目标的重复群体博弈是PSPACE完全的。

Abstract: In repeated games, players choose actions concurrently at each step. We
consider a parameterized setting of repeated games in which the players form a
population of an arbitrary size. Their utility functions encode a reachability
objective. The problem is whether there exists a uniform coalition strategy for
the players so that they are sure to win independently of the population size.
We use algebraic tools to show that the problem can be solved in polynomial
space. First we exhibit a finite semigroup whose elements summarize strategies
over a finite interval of population sizes. Then, we characterize the existence
of winning strategies by the existence of particular elements in this
semigroup. Finally, we provide a matching complexity lower bound, to conclude
that repeated population games with reachability objectives are
PSPACE-complete.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BrowserArena是一个开放的网页代理评估平台，通过用户提交任务、Arena式对比和步骤级人工反馈来识别网页代理的失败模式，发现了验证码解决、弹窗横幅移除和直接URL导航三个主要问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前网页代理评估局限于沙盒环境或人工任务，需要真实开放网络环境下的评估平台来识别代理的实际失败模式。

Method: 构建BrowserArena平台，收集用户任务，进行Arena式对比评估，使用步骤级人工反馈分析代理轨迹，并针对发现的失败模式构建专门数据集进行深入研究。

Result: 识别出三个一致的失败模式：验证码解决、弹窗横幅移除和直接URL导航。发现不同语言模型在这些任务上的表现差异，如o4-mini使用更多策略绕过验证码，DeepSeek-R1在验证码解决上误导用户。

Conclusion: 当前网页代理存在多样性和脆弱性，提出的基准测试方法为大规模评估和理解网页代理失败模式提供了有效途径。

Abstract: LLM web agents now browse and take actions on the open web, yet current agent
evaluations are constrained to sandboxed environments or artificial tasks. We
introduce BrowserArena, a live open-web agent evaluation platform that collects
user-submitted tasks, runs Arena-style head-to-head comparisons, and uses
step-level human feedback to surface failure modes. Collecting and analyzing
step-level annotations on the agent traces, we identify three consistent
failure modes: captcha resolution, pop-up banner removal, and direct navigation
to URLs. By constructing targeted datasets to further study these tasks, we
discover variations in how different language models navigate these failure
modes. We find, for example, that o4-mini deploys a wider variety of strategies
to circumvent captcha resolution than other models and DeepSeek-R1 consistently
misleads users about captcha resolution. Our findings surface both the
diversity and brittleness of current web agents. More broadly, our benchmarking
methodology provides an approach to evaluating and understanding web agent
failure modes at scale.

Motivation: 现有ShotBench基准存在选项设计模糊、模型推理一致性不足等问题，影响了评估的可靠性，阻碍了电影摄影理解领域的公平比较和未来发展。

Method: 通过一致性选项重构系统改进ShotBench，对ShotVL模型进行首次关键推理行为分析，并引入联合评估任务准确性和核心模型能力的扩展评估协议。

Result: 开发了RefineShot基准，这是一个经过改进和扩展的基准测试，能够实现更可靠的评估，促进电影摄影理解领域的未来发展。

Conclusion: RefineShot基准解决了ShotBench的局限性，为电影摄影理解任务提供了更可靠和全面的评估框架，有助于推动该领域的进步。

Abstract: Cinematography understanding refers to the ability to recognize not only the
visual content of a scene but also the cinematic techniques that shape
narrative meaning. This capability is attracting increasing attention, as it
enhances multimodal understanding in real-world applications and underpins
coherent content creation in film and media. As the most comprehensive
benchmark for this task, ShotBench spans a wide range of cinematic concepts and
VQA-style evaluations, with ShotVL achieving state-of-the-art results on it.
However, our analysis reveals that ambiguous option design in ShotBench and
ShotVL's shortcomings in reasoning consistency and instruction adherence
undermine evaluation reliability, limiting fair comparison and hindering future
progress. To overcome these issues, we systematically refine ShotBench through
consistent option restructuring, conduct the first critical analysis of
ShotVL's reasoning behavior, and introduce an extended evaluation protocol that
jointly assesses task accuracy and core model competencies. These efforts lead
to RefineShot, a refined and expanded benchmark that enables more reliable
assessment and fosters future advances in cinematography understanding.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种基于分布无关风险控制的方法，通过动态提前退出机制来防御恶意上下文示例对LLM性能的负面影响，同时保持对有益输入的效率增益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs能够从少量上下文示例中学习新任务，但这种灵活性带来了安全隐患：恶意示例可能在不被察觉的情况下影响模型行为，因此需要内置防御机制。

Method: 定义零样本下的安全基准行为，应用分布无关风险控制来限制上下文示例对性能的负面影响，通过动态提前退出预测忽略对恶意输入关注最多的注意力头。

Result: 理论和实证结果表明，该方法能有效控制恶意上下文示例的风险，同时在有益示例上实现显著的计算效率提升。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为LLMs提供了内置的安全防护机制，能够在保持对有益输入效率增益的同时，有效防御恶意上下文示例的攻击。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate a remarkable ability to learn new
tasks from a few in-context examples. However, this flexibility introduces
safety concerns: LLMs can be influenced by incorrect or malicious
demonstrations -- for example, if an adversary tampers with or injects harmful
examples without a human supervisor noticing. This motivates principled designs
in which the system itself includes built-in mechanisms to guard against such
attacks. We propose a novel approach to limit the degree to which harmful
demonstrations can degrade model performance. First, we define a baseline
``safe'' behavior for the model -- the model's performance given no in-context
demonstrations (zero-shot). Next, we apply distribution-free risk control
(DFRC) to control the extent to which in-context samples can decay performance
below zero-shot. We achieve this by leveraging dynamic early exit prediction,
ignoring later attention heads that attend the most to the unsafe inputs.
Finally, we propose modifications to DFRC that allow it to both control risk
for harmful inputs \textit{and} leverage performance and efficiency gains on
helpful inputs. We present both theoretical and empirical results showing that
our approach can effectively control risk for harmful in-context demonstrations
while simultaneously achieving substantial computational efficiency gains with
helpful demonstrations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型多模态模型在上下文学习中处理空间关系任务的内在机制，理解模型如何编码和利用关系知识。

Method: 使用因果中介分析识别影响关系预测的注意力头，提取多模态功能向量，并通过少量数据微调这些向量。

Result: 提取的功能向量能提高零样本推理准确率，经过微调后显著超越上下文学习基线，并能线性组合解决未训练的空间关系类比问题。

Conclusion: LMMs在局部内部结构中编码空间关系知识，这些知识可以被系统提取和优化，增强了模型模块化理解和关系推理控制能力。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) demonstrate impressive in-context learning
abilities from limited multimodal demonstrations, yet the internal mechanisms
supporting such task learning remain opaque. Building on prior work of large
language models, we show that a small subset of attention heads in the
vision-language model OpenFlamingo-4B is responsible for transmitting
representations of spatial relations. The activations of these attention heads,
termed function vectors, can be extracted and manipulated to alter an LMM's
performance on relational tasks. First, using both synthetic and real image
datasets, we apply causal mediation analysis to identify attention heads that
strongly influence relational predictions, and extract multimodal function
vectors that improve zero-shot accuracy at inference time. We further
demonstrate that these multimodal function vectors can be fine-tuned with a
modest amount of training data, while keeping LMM parameters frozen, to
significantly outperform in-context learning baselines. Finally, we show that
relation-specific function vectors can be linearly combined to solve analogy
problems involving novel and untrained spatial relations, highlighting the
strong generalization ability of this approach. Our results show that LMMs
encode spatial relational knowledge within localized internal structures, which
can be systematically extracted and optimized, thereby advancing our
understanding of model modularity and enhancing control over relational
reasoning in LMMs.

Abstract: While agentic AI has advanced in automating individual tasks, managing
complex multi-agent workflows remains a challenging problem. This paper
presents a research vision for autonomous agentic systems that orchestrate
collaboration within dynamic human-AI teams. We propose the Autonomous Manager
Agent as a core challenge: an agent that decomposes complex goals into task
graphs, allocates tasks to human and AI workers, monitors progress, adapts to
changing conditions, and maintains transparent stakeholder communication. We
formalize workflow management as a Partially Observable Stochastic Game and
identify four foundational challenges: (1) compositional reasoning for
hierarchical decomposition, (2) multi-objective optimization under shifting
preferences, (3) coordination and planning in ad hoc teams, and (4) governance
and compliance by design. To advance this agenda, we release MA-Gym, an
open-source simulation and evaluation framework for multi-agent workflow
orchestration. Evaluating GPT-5-based Manager Agents across 20 workflows, we
find they struggle to jointly optimize for goal completion, constraint
adherence, and workflow runtime - underscoring workflow management as a
difficult open problem. We conclude with organizational and ethical
implications of autonomous management systems.

Abstract: Agentic systems enable the intelligent use of research tooling, augmenting a
researcher's ability to investigate and propose novel solutions to existing
problems. Within Additive Manufacturing (AM), alloy discovery remains a complex
challenge, often requiring expertise in the various domains of materials
science, thermodynamic simulations, and experimental analysis. Large Language
Model (LLM) enabled agents can facilitate this endeavor by utilizing their
extensive knowledge base to dispatch tool calls via Model Context Protocol
(MCP) to perform actions such as Thermo-Calc property diagram calculations and
lack of fusion process map generation. In addition, the multi-agent system
developed in this work is able to effectively reason through complex user
prompts and provide analysis on the printability of proposed alloys. These
agents can dynamically adjust their task trajectory to the outcomes of tool
call results, effectively enabling autonomous decision-making in practical
environments. This work aims to utilize LLM enabled agents to automate and
accelerate the task of alloy discovery within the field of additive
manufacturing and showcase the benefits of adopting this multi-agent system.

Abstract: Container stowage planning (CSPP) is a critical component of maritime
transportation and terminal operations, directly affecting supply chain
efficiency. Owing to its complexity, CSPP has traditionally relied on human
expertise. While reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been applied to CSPP,
systematic benchmark comparisons across different algorithms remain limited. To
address this gap, we develop a Gym environment that captures the fundamental
features of CSPP and extend it to include crane scheduling in both multi-agent
and single-agent formulations. Within this framework, we evaluate five RL
algorithms: DQN, QR-DQN, A2C, PPO, and TRPO under multiple scenarios of varying
complexity. The results reveal distinct performance gaps with increasing
complexity, underscoring the importance of algorithm choice and problem
formulation for CSPP. Overall, this paper benchmarks multiple RL methods for
CSPP while providing a reusable Gym environment with crane scheduling, thus
offering a foundation for future research and practical deployment in maritime
logistics.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by large language models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, yet existing automated design
approaches seek monolithic solutions that fail to adapt resource allocation
based on query complexity and domain requirements. This paper introduces
AutoMaAS, a self-evolving multi-agent architecture search framework that
leverages neural architecture search principles to automatically discover
optimal agent configurations through dynamic operator lifecycle management and
automated machine learning techniques. Our approach incorporates four key
innovations: (1) automatic operator generation, fusion, and elimination based
on performance-cost analysis, (2) dynamic cost-aware optimization with
real-time parameter adjustment, (3) online feedback integration for continuous
architecture refinement, and (4) enhanced interpretability through decision
tracing mechanisms. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate
that AutoMaAS achieves 1.0-7.1\% performance improvement while reducing
inference costs by 3-5\% compared to state-of-the-art methods. The framework
shows superior transferability across datasets and LLM backbones, establishing
a new paradigm for automated multi-agent system design in the era of large

Abstract: The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into smart grids presents unique
opportunities to enhance both transportation systems and energy networks.
However, ensuring safe and interpretable interactions between drivers,
vehicles, and the surrounding environment remains a critical challenge. This
paper presents a multi-modal large language model (LLM)-based framework to
process multimodal sensor data - such as object detection, semantic
segmentation, and vehicular telemetry - and generate natural-language alerts
for drivers. The framework is validated using real-world data collected from
instrumented vehicles driving on urban roads, ensuring its applicability to
real-world scenarios. By combining visual perception (YOLOv8), geocoded
positioning, and CAN bus telemetry, the framework bridges raw sensor data and
driver comprehension, enabling safer and more informed decision-making in urban
driving scenarios. Case studies using real data demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in generating context-aware alerts for critical situations, such
as proximity to pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles. This paper
highlights the potential of LLMs as assistive tools in e-mobility, benefiting
both transportation systems and electric networks by enabling scalable fleet
coordination, EV load forecasting, and traffic-aware energy planning.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) deployed in real-world tasks such as computer-use
agents must integrate diverse modalities. How good are FMs at performing joint
reasoning, simultaneously reasoning over multiple modalities, especially when
the modalities interact and relate to each other to form cross-modal context?
To better understand this problem, we study FMs on cross-modal conflicts:
scenarios where conflicting evidence is presented across modalities. This
allows us to examine whether FMs prioritize one modality over another or reason
jointly to reconcile the conflict. Our experiments reveal that FMs can
recognize conflicts in unimodal contexts, composed of a single modality, 90% of
the time, but the ratio falls as low as 3% when evidence is split across
modalities -- similar observations hold in cross-lingual contexts, composed of
multiple languages. We trace this failure to cross-modal attention imbalance,
showing that FMs exhibit extreme asymmetry in attention scores,
disproportionately prioritizing certain modalities. We show that cross-modal
attention imbalance does not go away by simply scaling up multimodal or
multilingual datasets blindly, since they lack training examples that
explicitly require cross-modal reasoning. We demonstrate that even a simple and
scalable method of explicitly combining multiple modalities within each
training instance significantly reduces attention imbalance. Reduced attention
imbalance directly translates to improved downstream performance on several
vision-language benchmarks. Our findings underscore the importance of
systematically addressing cross-modal contexts to build reliable foundation
models.

### [178] [On the Role of Temperature Sampling in Test-Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02611)
*Yuheng Wu,Azalia Mirhoseini,Thierry Tambe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究表明，测试时扩展（TTS）在样本数量K达到一定规模后收益递减，而温度维度扩展能显著提升模型推理能力，使基础模型达到与强化学习训练模型相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究显示增加推理轨迹样本数量K能持续提升准确率，但本文发现这种趋势不会无限持续，且单一温度采样只能探索模型潜力的一部分。

Method: 提出温度维度扩展方法，通过在不同采样温度下生成推理轨迹来扩大模型的推理边界，并设计了多温度投票方法来降低计算开销。

Result: 在多个模型和推理基准测试中，温度扩展相比单一温度TTS额外提升7.3个百分点，基础模型能达到与RL训练模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: TTS的潜力比之前认为的更大，温度扩展提供了一种简单有效的方法来释放基础模型的潜在能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can improve reasoning at inference time through
test-time scaling (TTS), where multiple reasoning traces are generated and the
best one is selected. Prior work shows that increasing the number of samples K
steadily improves accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that this trend does
not hold indefinitely: at large K, further scaling yields no gains, and certain
hard questions remain unsolved regardless of the number of traces.
Interestingly, we find that different sampling temperatures solve different
subsets of problems, implying that single-temperature scaling explores only
part of a model's potential. We therefore propose scaling along the temperature
dimension, which enlarges the reasoning boundary of LLMs. Averaged over Qwen3
(0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B) and five representative reasoning benchmarks (AIME
2024/2025, MATH500, LiveCodeBench, Hi-ToM), temperature scaling yields an
additional 7.3 points over single-temperature TTS. Temperature scaling also
enables base models to reach performance comparable to reinforcement learning
(RL)-trained counterparts, without additional post-training. We further provide
a comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon and design a multi-temperature
voting method that reduces the overhead of temperature scaling. Overall, our
findings suggest that TTS is more powerful than previously thought, and that
temperature scaling offers a simple and effective way to unlock the latent
potential of base models.

### [179] [A Concept of Possibility for Real-World Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02655)
*Daniel G. Schwartz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的可能性概念，作为对Zadeh在1978年提出的标准概念的替代。该概念专注于真实世界事件的可能性，将事件视为具有促使其发生的先决条件和阻碍其发生的约束条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可能性概念存在局限性，需要一种更专注于真实世界事件可能性的新概念，特别是在规划问题中评估计划可行性的需求。

Method: 将事件建模为具有先决条件和约束条件，通过计算先决条件成立且约束条件不成立的概率函数来计算事件可能性。采用Łukasiewicz多值逻辑解释逻辑连接词。

Result: 开发了一个可用于规划问题的可能性理论框架，能够比较不同计划的可能性（易行性或可行性），并通过车辆路线规划示例进行了说明。

Conclusion: 这种可能性模型可能正确捕捉了人类对计划的正常推理过程，在规划问题中具有应用潜力，并为未来应用提供了建议。

Abstract: This paper offers a new concept of {\it possibility} as an alternative to the
now-a-days standard concept originally introduced by L.A. Zadeh in 1978. This
new version was inspired by the original but, formally, has nothing in common
with it other than that they both adopt the {\L}ukasiewicz multivalent
interpretation of the logical connectives. Moreover, rather than seeking to
provide a general notion of possibility, this focuses specifically on the
possibility of a real-world event. An event is viewed as having prerequisites
that enable its occurrence and constraints that may impede its occurrence, and
the possibility of the event is computed as a function of the probabilities
that the prerequisites hold and the constraints do not. This version of
possibility might appropriately be applied to problems of planning. When there
are multiple plans available for achieving a goal, this theory can be used to
determine which plan is most possible, i.e., easiest or most feasible to
complete. It is speculated that this model of reasoning correctly captures
normal human reasoning about plans. The theory is elaborated and an
illustrative example for vehicle route planning is provided. There is also a
suggestion of potential future applications.

*Zhaorun Chen,Xun Liu,Mintong Kang,Jiawei Zhang,Minzhou Pan,Shuang Yang,Bo Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了ARMs自适应红队代理，通过推理增强的多步编排自动优化多样化红队策略，有效引发目标VLM的有害输出，在基准测试中达到最先进的攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型(VLMs)的普及，其多模态接口引入了新的安全漏洞，现有红队方法要么局限于有限的对抗模式，要么依赖人工工程，缺乏对新兴现实世界VLM漏洞的可扩展探索。

Method: 提出11种新颖的多模态攻击策略，涵盖VLM的多样化对抗模式，通过模型上下文协议(MCP)集成17种红队算法，设计分层记忆和epsilon-greedy攻击探索算法来平衡攻击的多样性和有效性。

Result: 在实例和策略基准测试中，ARMs达到最先进的攻击成功率，平均超过基线52.1%，在Claude-4-Sonnet上超过90%。构建了包含30K+红队实例的ARMs-Bench数据集，安全微调显著提高了VLM的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ARMs能够系统性地发现VLM的新兴漏洞，ARMs-Bench数据集为改进多模态安全对齐提供了可行指导，同时保持了模型的一般效用。

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) gain prominence, their multimodal interfaces
also introduce new safety vulnerabilities, making the safety evaluation
challenging and critical. Existing red-teaming efforts are either restricted to
a narrow set of adversarial patterns or depend heavily on manual engineering,
lacking scalable exploration of emerging real-world VLM vulnerabilities. To
bridge this gap, we propose ARMs, an adaptive red-teaming agent that
systematically conducts comprehensive risk assessments for VLMs. Given a target
harmful behavior or risk definition, ARMs automatically optimizes diverse
red-teaming strategies with reasoning-enhanced multi-step orchestration, to
effectively elicit harmful outputs from target VLMs. We propose 11 novel
multimodal attack strategies, covering diverse adversarial patterns of VLMs
(e.g., reasoning hijacking, contextual cloaking), and integrate 17 red-teaming
algorithms into ARMs via model context protocol (MCP). To balance the diversity
and effectiveness of the attack, we design a layered memory with an
epsilon-greedy attack exploration algorithm. Extensive experiments on instance-
and policy-based benchmarks show that ARMs achieves SOTA attack success rates,
exceeding baselines by an average of 52.1% and surpassing 90% on
Claude-4-Sonnet. We show that the diversity of red-teaming instances generated
by ARMs is significantly higher, revealing emerging vulnerabilities in VLMs.
Leveraging ARMs, we construct ARMs-Bench, a large-scale multimodal safety
dataset comprising over 30K red-teaming instances spanning 51 diverse risk
categories, grounded in both real-world multimodal threats and regulatory
risks. Safety fine-tuning with ARMs-Bench substantially improves the robustness
of VLMs while preserving their general utility, providing actionable guidance
to improve multimodal safety alignment against emerging threats.

TL;DR: 提出了一种约束中心架构，通过层次化结构空间和领域特定表示来规范LLMs，实现生产调度中可靠的自动约束规范，显著优于纯LLM方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代制造环境中APS系统至关重要，但将制造需求转化为正式约束仍依赖人工且劳动密集。虽然LLMs在自动化约束规范方面有潜力，但直接应用面临自然语言歧义、非确定性输出和领域知识有限等挑战。

Method: 设计约束中心架构，定义跨三个层次的组织化层次结构空间，通过领域特定表示确保精度和可靠性。开发自动化生产场景适配算法，为特定制造配置高效定制架构。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法成功平衡了LLMs的生成能力和制造系统的可靠性要求，在约束规范任务中显著优于纯LLM方法。

Conclusion: 约束中心架构有效解决了LLMs在制造约束规范中的可靠性问题，为自动化生产调度约束生成提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) systems have become indispensable for
modern manufacturing operations, enabling optimized resource allocation and
production efficiency in increasingly complex and dynamic environments. While
algorithms for solving abstracted scheduling problems have been extensively
investigated, the critical prerequisite of specifying manufacturing
requirements into formal constraints remains manual and labor-intensive.
Although recent advances of generative models, particularly Large Language
Models (LLMs), show promise in automating constraint specification from
heterogeneous raw manufacturing data, their direct application faces challenges
due to natural language ambiguity, non-deterministic outputs, and limited
domain-specific knowledge. This paper presents a constraint-centric
architecture that regulates LLMs to perform reliable automated constraint
specification for production scheduling. The architecture defines a
hierarchical structural space organized across three levels, implemented
through domain-specific representation to ensure precision and reliability
while maintaining flexibility. Furthermore, an automated production scenario
adaptation algorithm is designed and deployed to efficiently customize the
architecture for specific manufacturing configurations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully balances the generative
capabilities of LLMs with the reliability requirements of manufacturing
systems, significantly outperforming pure LLM-based approaches in constraint
specification tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了Node-wise Consistency Verification (NCV)框架，通过节点级一致性检查来验证大语言模型的多步推理，提高错误定位精度并减少token消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在验证多步推理时存在错误定位不精确和token成本高的问题，要么评估整个推理链导致注意力稀释，要么依赖昂贵的多重采样。

Method: NCV将验证重构为节点级的轻量级二进制一致性检查，通过将思维链分解为相互连接的验证节点来避免不必要的长文本生成。

Result: 在公开数据集上，NCV相比传统方法（如基于CoT的验证器）在F1分数上提升了10%到25%，同时使用的token数量减少了6倍到58倍。

Conclusion: NCV提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，能够提高LLM推理验证的可解释性和效率。

Abstract: Verifying multi-step reasoning in large language models is difficult due to
imprecise error localization and high token costs. Existing methods either
assess entire reasoning chains, suffering attention dilution, or rely on
expensive multi-sampling. We introduce Node-wise Consistency Verification
(NCV), a training-free framework that recasts verification as lightweight
binary consistency checks at the node level. By decomposing the chain of
thought into interconnected verification nodes, NCV precisely localizes errors
and avoids unnecessary long-form generation. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach enhances interpretability and efficiency, presenting a scalable
solution for reliable LLM reasoning verification. On public datasets, NCV
achieves a 10\% to 25\% improvement in F1 scores over baselines while utilizing
$6\times$~$58\times$ fewer tokens than traditional methods like CoT-based
verifiers.

TL;DR: TRACE框架用于多维评估工具增强LLM代理的性能，通过证据库积累推理步骤知识，有效分析代理的推理轨迹，超越了传统答案匹配的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强基准的评估方法仅限于答案匹配，无法评估问题解决轨迹的效率、幻觉和适应性等多维性能。

Method: 引入TRACE框架，通过证据库积累推理步骤知识，实现代理推理轨迹的多维分析和评估，并构建元评估数据集验证框架有效性。

Result: TRACE能够准确、可扩展且经济高效地评估复杂行为，即使使用小型开源LLM也能获得良好效果，并揭示了先前未报告的观察结果。

Conclusion: TRACE为工具增强LLM代理提供了超越答案匹配的全面评估方法，能够有效分析推理轨迹的多维性能特征。

Abstract: Although recent tool-augmented benchmarks incorporate complex user requests
and diverse tools, the evaluation methods for most of them remain limited to
answer matching. However, as the number of steps required to resolve a user
request increases, a proper evaluation of an agent's performance must go beyond
the final answer to also assess the problem-solving trajectory, including
previously ignored aspects such as efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity.
The most straightforward method for evaluating these aspects is to compare an
agent's trajectory with the ground-truth trajectory, but this approach is
fundamentally limited since annotating all valid ground-truth trajectories is
prohibitively expensive. However, a simple LLM-based evaluator struggles to
assess trajectories in detail without ground truth. To effectively evaluate the
agents in this manner, we introduce TRACE, a framework for the
multi-dimensional evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agent performance. By
incorporating an evidence bank, which accumulates knowledge gathered from
preceding reasoning steps, TRACE enables a multi-faceted analysis and
evaluation of an agent's reasoning trajectory effectively. To validate our
framework, we develop a new meta-evaluation dataset by augmenting existing
benchmarks with diverse and flawed trajectories, each labeled with
multi-faceted performance scores. Our results confirm that TRACE accurately
evaluates these complex behaviors in a scalable and cost-effective manner, even
with small open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we apply our method to evaluate the
trajectories that agents produce while solving tool-augmented tasks, presenting
previously unreported observations and their corresponding insights.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文质疑机器学习中的目标满足假设(OSA)，指出在实际条件下由于近似、估计和优化误差，模型无法完全满足指定目标函数，而且开发者意图无法完美转化为形式化目标，导致目标误设不可避免。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战机器学习中普遍但未经检验的假设——训练得到的模型确实满足其指定的目标函数(OSA)，揭示该假设在现实条件下的失效问题及其严重后果。

Method: 采用学习范式无关的框架，分析近似误差、估计误差和优化误差如何导致系统性地偏离预期目标，并基于近期数学结果论证这些差距与Goodhart定律失效模式无法区分。

Result: 证明OSA在现实条件下必然失败，目标误设不可避免，且无法事先确定Goodhart临界点，持续优化可能导致系统进入可预测且不可控的状态。

Conclusion: 需要对通用人工智能系统的优化设置原则性限制，否则持续优化可能推动系统进入可预测且不可逆的失控状态。

Abstract: A common but rarely examined assumption in machine learning is that training
yields models that actually satisfy their specified objective function. We call
this the Objective Satisfaction Assumption (OSA). Although deviations from OSA
are acknowledged, their implications are overlooked. We argue, in a
learning-paradigm-agnostic framework, that OSA fails in realistic conditions:
approximation, estimation, and optimization errors guarantee systematic
deviations from the intended objective, regardless of the quality of its
specification. Beyond these technical limitations, perfectly capturing and
translating the developer's intent, such as alignment with human preferences,
into a formal objective is practically impossible, making misspecification
inevitable. Building on recent mathematical results, absent a mathematical
characterization of these gaps, they are indistinguishable from those that
collapse into Goodhart's law failure modes under strong optimization pressure.
Because the Goodhart breaking point cannot be located ex ante, a principled
limit on the optimization of General-Purpose AI systems is necessary. Absent
such a limit, continued optimization is liable to push systems into predictable
and irreversible loss of control.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了BayesianRouter框架，通过结合离线RM强度学习和在线贝叶斯选择，动态选择奖励模型来提升大语言模型对齐质量，避免单一RM的过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLHF/RLAIF方法依赖单一奖励模型，限制了对齐质量并可能导致过拟合。现有RM路由方法存在冷启动和探索不足的问题。

Method: 混合路由框架：离线阶段训练多任务路由器估计每个RM的可靠性；在线阶段使用贝叶斯Thompson采样进行每查询RM选择，用离线嵌入作为高斯先验初始化权重向量，并通过在线奖励自适应更新后验分布。

Result: 在指令跟随（AlpacaEval-2、Arena-Hard、MT-Bench）和推理（GSM8K、MMLU）基准测试中，BayesianRouter持续优于单个RM、RM集成和现有路由方法。

Conclusion: BayesianRouter通过有效结合离线和在线学习，解决了RM路由中的冷启动和探索不足问题，显著提升了语言模型对齐性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human or AI feedback (RLHF / RLAIF) has become
the standard paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, most
pipelines rely on a single reward model (RM), limiting alignment quality and
risking overfitting. Recent work explores RM routing--dynamically selecting an
RM from a candidate pool to exploit complementary strengths while maintaining
$O(1)$ RM calls--but existing methods suffer from cold-start and insufficient
exploration. We propose BayesianRouter, a hybrid routing framework that
combines offline RM strengths learning with online Bayesian selection. In the
offline stage, a multi-task router is trained on preference data to estimate
per-RM reliability. In the online stage, a Bayesian Thompson sampling router
performs per-query RM selection, initializing RM-specific weight vectors with
offline embeddings as Gaussian priors and adaptively updating their posteriors
with online rewards to adapt to the evolving policy distribution. Extensive
experiments on instruction-following (AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, MT-Bench) and
reasoning (GSM8K, MMLU) benchmarks show that BayesianRouter consistently
outperforms individual RMs, RM ensembling, and existing routing methods.

Motivation: 优化离散扩散模型(DDM)的奖励仍然具有挑战性：非自回归范式使得重要性采样难以处理且rollout复杂，这困扰了如GRPO等强化学习方法。

Method: 首先澄清DDM的理论基础，构建能够捕捉有价值token波动的重要性估计器；然后为视觉序列精心定制rollout方法，产生多样化的补全和可靠的优化梯度。

Result: 在数学推理、编码和视觉生成基准测试中，MaskGRPO带来了更稳定和高效的更新，导致更强的推理性能和更好的生成质量。

Conclusion: 本研究确立了MaskGRPO作为一种系统性的策略优化方法，并且是离散化视觉扩散的第一个实用方法。

Abstract: Optimizing discrete diffusion model (DDM) with rewards remains a challenge:
the non-autoregressive paradigm makes importance sampling intractable and
rollout complex, puzzling reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this study, we introduce MaskGRPO, the first
viable approach to enable scalable multimodal reinforcement learning in
discrete diffusion with effective importance sampling and modality-specific
adaptations. To this end, we first clarify the theoretical foundation for DDMs,
which facilitates building an importance estimator that captures valuable token
fluctuation for gradient updates. We then delicately tailored the rollout
method for visual sequences, which yields diverse completions and reliable
optimization gradients. Upon math reasoning, coding, and visual generation
benchmarks, MaskGRPO brings more stable and efficient updates, leading to
stronger reasoning performance and better generation quality. This study
establishes MaskGRPO as a systematic policy optimization approach and the first
practical way for discretized visual diffusion.

Conclusion: 在选择XAI方法时需要考虑其背后的本体论-认识论范式，并讨论了如何为不同应用领域选择和调整合适的XAI方法，以确保解释的有效性和适用性。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is being applied in almost every field. At the
same time, the currently dominant deep learning methods are fundamentally
black-box systems that lack explanations for their inferences, significantly
limiting their trustworthiness and adoption. Explainable AI (XAI) methods aim
to overcome this challenge by providing explanations of the models' decision
process. Such methods are often proposed and developed by engineers and
scientists with a predominantly technical background and incorporate their
assumptions about the existence, validity, and explanatory utility of different
conceivable explanatory mechanisms. However, the basic concept of an
explanation -- what it is, whether we can know it, whether it is absolute or
relative -- is far from trivial and has been the subject of deep philosophical
debate for millennia. As we point out here, the assumptions incorporated into
different XAI methods are not harmless and have important consequences for the
validity and interpretation of AI explanations in different domains. We
investigate ontological and epistemological assumptions in explainability
methods when they are applied to AI systems, meaning the assumptions we make
about the existence of explanations and our ability to gain knowledge about
those explanations. Our analysis shows how seemingly small technical changes to
an XAI method may correspond to important differences in the underlying
assumptions about explanations. We furthermore highlight the risks of ignoring
the underlying onto-epistemological paradigm when choosing an XAI method for a
given application, and we discuss how to select and adapt appropriate XAI
methods for different domains of application.

Method: 开发了一个插件来扩展现有的智能环境解释引擎，实现了反事实解释的形式化和实现，并通过用户研究(N=17)评估反事实解释与传统因果解释的效果。

Conclusion: 本文为智能环境中的新型解释提供了实用框架，并为选择最有效的解释类型提供了实证依据。

Abstract: Explainability is increasingly seen as an essential feature of rule-based
smart environments. While counterfactual explanations, which describe what
could have been done differently to achieve a desired outcome, are a powerful
tool in eXplainable AI (XAI), no established methods exist for generating them
in these rule-based domains. In this paper, we present the first formalization
and implementation of counterfactual explanations tailored to this domain. It
is implemented as a plugin that extends an existing explanation engine for
smart environments. We conducted a user study (N=17) to evaluate our generated
counterfactuals against traditional causal explanations. The results show that
user preference is highly contextual: causal explanations are favored for their
linguistic simplicity and in time-pressured situations, while counterfactuals
are preferred for their actionable content, particularly when a user wants to
resolve a problem. Our work contributes a practical framework for a new type of
explanation in smart environments and provides empirical evidence to guide the
choice of when each explanation type is most effective.

Result: transformer模型在熟悉规则上表现良好，但在面对新颖或省略规则时准确率急剧下降；token级准确率与完整答案准确率之间存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 当前深度学习方法在抽象推理方面存在根本性局限，需要开发超越模式识别、具备稳健抽象推理能力的架构。

Abstract: Analogical reasoning lies at the core of human cognition and remains a
fundamental challenge for artificial intelligence. Raven's Progressive Matrices
(RPM) serve as a widely used benchmark to assess abstract reasoning by
requiring the inference of underlying structural rules. While many vision-based
and language-based models have achieved success on RPM tasks, it remains
unclear whether their performance reflects genuine reasoning ability or
reliance on statistical shortcuts. This study investigates the generalization
capacity of modern AI systems under conditions of incomplete training by
deliberately omitting several structural rules during training. Both
sequence-to-sequence transformer models and vision-based architectures such as
CoPINet and the Dual-Contrast Network are evaluated on the Impartial-RAVEN
(I-RAVEN) dataset. Experiments reveal that although transformers demonstrate
strong performance on familiar rules, their accuracy declines sharply when
faced with novel or omitted rules. Moreover, the gap between token-level
accuracy and complete answer accuracy highlights fundamental limitations in
current approaches. These findings provide new insights into the reasoning
mechanisms underlying deep learning models and underscore the need for
architectures that move beyond pattern recognition toward robust abstract
reasoning.

effectiveness in enhancing agent collaborative behaviour and decision-making.
We enhance CoELA, a framework designed for building Collaborative Embodied

Result: 广泛评估显示CoDA在总体评分上实现了显著提升，比竞争基线方法高出41.5%。

Conclusion: 可视化自动化的未来不在于孤立的代码生成，而在于集成的协作智能体工作流程。

Abstract: Deep research has revolutionized data analysis, yet data scientists still
devote substantial time to manually crafting visualizations, highlighting the
need for robust automation from natural language queries. However, current
systems struggle with complex datasets containing multiple files and iterative
refinement. Existing approaches, including simple single- or multi-agent
systems, often oversimplify the task, focusing on initial query parsing while
failing to robustly manage data complexity, code errors, or final visualization
quality. In this paper, we reframe this challenge as a collaborative
multi-agent problem. We introduce CoDA, a multi-agent system that employs
specialized LLM agents for metadata analysis, task planning, code generation,
and self-reflection. We formalize this pipeline, demonstrating how
metadata-focused analysis bypasses token limits and quality-driven refinement
ensures robustness. Extensive evaluations show CoDA achieves substantial gains
in the overall score, outperforming competitive baselines by up to 41.5%. This
work demonstrates that the future of visualization automation lies not in
isolated code generation but in integrated, collaborative agentic workflows.

TL;DR: 提出CCDD方法，在连续表示空间和离散标记空间上定义联合多模态扩散过程，通过单一模型同时去噪，解决了连续扩散模型在语言建模中的训练和采样质量问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续扩散模型理论上比离散扩散和循环变换器更具表达能力，但实际性能较差，主要原因是连续表示到离散标记空间的解码困难。

Method: 提出CCDD方法，在连续表示空间和离散标记空间的并集上定义联合多模态扩散过程，使用单一模型同时去噪，并设计了有效的架构和训练/采样技术。

Result: 在真实世界语言建模任务中展现出强大的实证性能，具有丰富的潜在空间语义和良好的样本质量。

Conclusion: CCDD方法成功结合了连续和离散模态的优势，在保持表达力的同时解决了连续扩散模型的训练和采样问题。

Abstract: Diffusion language models, especially masked discrete diffusion models, have
achieved great success recently. While there are some theoretical and primary
empirical results showing the advantages of latent reasoning with looped
transformers or continuous chain-of-thoughts, continuous diffusion models
typically underperform their discrete counterparts. In this paper, we argue
that diffusion language models do not necessarily need to be in the discrete
space. In particular, we prove that continuous diffusion models have stronger
expressivity than discrete diffusions and looped transformers. We attribute the
contradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance
to their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides
intermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce
additional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the
continuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous
Discrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process
on the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space,
leveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space. By
combining two modalities, CCDD is expressive with rich semantics in the latent
space, as well as good trainability and sample quality with the help of
explicit discrete tokens. We also propose effective architectures and advanced
training/sampling techniques for CCDD, which reveals strong empirical
performance in extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于极值预测的数据增强框架，结合GAN和SMOTE等数据增强方法与Conv-LSTM、BD-LSTM深度学习模型，以提升极端值预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极值预测在金融和气候变化等领域具有重要应用价值，但面临数据不平衡的挑战。本研究旨在通过数据增强技术解决这一问题。

Method: 使用GAN和SMOTE进行数据增强，结合Conv-LSTM和BD-LSTM深度学习模型进行多步超前预测，并提出了基于相关性函数的极值数据增强策略。

Result: SMOTE-based策略在短期和长期预测中表现最佳，Conv-LSTM在周期性稳定数据中表现优异，BD-LSTM在混沌或非平稳序列中表现更好。

Conclusion: 数据增强技术能有效提升极值预测性能，SMOTE方法具有更好的适应性，不同深度学习模型在不同数据类型中各有优势。

Abstract: Data augmentation with generative adversarial networks (GANs) has been
popular for class imbalance problems, mainly for pattern classification and
computer vision-related applications. Extreme value forecasting is a
challenging field that has various applications from finance to climate change
problems. In this study, we present a data augmentation framework for extreme
value forecasting. In this framework, our focus is on forecasting extreme
values using deep learning models in combination with data augmentation models
such as GANs and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). We use deep
learning models such as convolutional long short-term memory (Conv-LSTM) and
bidirectional long short-term memory (BD-LSTM) networks for multistep ahead
prediction featuring extremes. We investigate which data augmentation models
are the most suitable, taking into account the prediction accuracy overall and
at extreme regions, along with computational efficiency. We also present novel
strategies for incorporating data augmentation, considering extreme values
based on a relevance function. Our results indicate that the SMOTE-based
strategy consistently demonstrated superior adaptability, leading to improved
performance across both short- and long-horizon forecasts. Conv-LSTM and
BD-LSTM exhibit complementary strengths: the former excels in periodic, stable
datasets, while the latter performs better in chaotic or non-stationary
sequences.

TL;DR: OpenTSLM是一个时间序列语言模型家族，通过将时间序列作为原生模态集成到预训练LLMs中，解决了LLMs无法处理时间序列的局限性。包含两种架构：SoftPrompt（隐式建模）和Flamingo（显式建模），在多个医疗时间序列推理任务中显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在多模态数据解释方面表现出色，但在医学领域无法处理时间序列数据，限制了其在临床信息分析和数字健康应用中的潜力。

Method: 提出两种架构：1) OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt：通过软提示将可学习时间序列标记与文本标记连接进行隐式建模；2) OpenTSLM-Flamingo：通过交叉注意力将时间序列与文本集成进行显式建模。

Result: 在HAR-CoT、Sleep-CoT和ECG-QA-CoT三个数据集上，OpenTSLM模型均优于基线方法，在睡眠分期达到69.9 F1，在HAR达到65.4 F1，显著优于仅文本微调模型（9.05和52.2）。即使是1B参数的OpenTSLM也超越了GPT-4o。

Conclusion: OpenTSLM成功将时间序列作为原生模态集成到LLMs中，实现了对任意长度时间序列的推理能力，在医疗时间序列分析任务中表现出色，为相关研究提供了开源工具和数据集。

Abstract: LLMs have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting multimodal data. In
medicine, they hold particular promise for synthesizing large volumes of
clinical information into actionable insights and digital health applications.
Yet, a major limitation remains their inability to handle time series. To
overcome this gap, we present OpenTSLM, a family of Time Series Language Models
(TSLMs) created by integrating time series as a native modality to pretrained
LLMs, enabling reasoning over multiple time series of any length. We
investigate two architectures for OpenTSLM. The first, OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt,
models time series implicitly by concatenating learnable time series tokens
with text tokens via soft prompting. Although parameter-efficient, we
hypothesize that explicit time series modeling scales better and outperforms
implicit approaches. We thus introduce OpenTSLM-Flamingo, which integrates time
series with text via cross-attention. We benchmark both variants against
baselines that treat time series as text tokens or plots, across a suite of
text-time-series Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning tasks. We introduce three
datasets: HAR-CoT, Sleep-CoT, and ECG-QA-CoT. Across all, OpenTSLM models
outperform baselines, reaching 69.9 F1 in sleep staging and 65.4 in HAR,
compared to 9.05 and 52.2 for finetuned text-only models. Notably, even
1B-parameter OpenTSLM models surpass GPT-4o (15.47 and 2.95). OpenTSLM-Flamingo
matches OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt in performance and outperforms on longer sequences,
while maintaining stable memory requirements. By contrast, SoftPrompt grows
exponentially in memory with sequence length, requiring around 110 GB compared
to 40 GB VRAM when training on ECG-QA with LLaMA-3B. Expert reviews by
clinicians find strong reasoning capabilities exhibited by OpenTSLMs on ECG-QA.
To facilitate further research, we provide all code, datasets, and models
open-source.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RainSeer是一个结构感知的降雨场重建框架，利用雷达反射率作为物理结构先验，通过两阶段物理信息架构解决雷达数据与地面降雨观测之间的空间对齐和物理转换问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有空间插值方法在重建高分辨率降雨场时往往过度平滑，无法捕捉尖锐过渡和局域极端值，影响了洪水预报、水文建模和气候分析的准确性。

Method: 采用物理信息的两阶段架构：结构到点映射器进行空间对齐，将中尺度雷达结构投影到局域地面降雨；地理感知降雨解码器通过因果时空注意力机制捕捉水凝物下降过程中的语义转换。

Result: 在两个公共数据集（RAIN-F和MeteoNet）上评估，相比最先进基线方法，MAE降低超过13.31%，显著提升了重建降雨场的结构保真度。

Conclusion: RainSeer通过将雷达反射率重新解释为物理基础的结构先验，成功解决了降雨场重建中的结构保持问题，为高精度降雨监测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing high-resolution rainfall fields is essential for flood
forecasting, hydrological modeling, and climate analysis. However, existing
spatial interpolation methods-whether based on automatic weather station (AWS)
measurements or enhanced with satellite/radar observations often over-smooth
critical structures, failing to capture sharp transitions and localized
extremes. We introduce RainSeer, a structure-aware reconstruction framework
that reinterprets radar reflectivity as a physically grounded structural
prior-capturing when, where, and how rain develops. This shift, however,
introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) translating high-resolution
volumetric radar fields into sparse point-wise rainfall observations, and (ii)
bridging the physical disconnect between aloft hydro-meteors and ground-level
precipitation. RainSeer addresses these through a physics-informed two-stage
architecture: a Structure-to-Point Mapper performs spatial alignment by
projecting mesoscale radar structures into localized ground-level rainfall,
through a bidirectional mapping, and a Geo-Aware Rain Decoder captures the
semantic transformation of hydro-meteors through descent, melting, and
evaporation via a causal spatiotemporal attention mechanism. We evaluate
RainSeer on two public datasets-RAIN-F (Korea, 2017-2019) and MeteoNet (France,
2016-2018)-and observe consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines,
reducing MAE by over 13.31% and significantly enhancing structural fidelity in
reconstructed rainfall fields.

TL;DR: 提出了Advisor Models，这是一种轻量级参数化策略，通过强化学习训练，能够对黑盒模型进行动态的自然语言引导，相比静态提示优化具有更好的适应性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基础模型部署为黑盒服务时，模型权重无法修改，只能通过提示进行定制。静态提示优化产生固定的提示，无法适应不同的输入、用户或环境。

Method: 使用强化学习训练轻量级参数化策略（Advisor Models），该策略能够根据环境反馈动态生成自然语言指导指令，在上下文中引导黑盒模型。

Result: 在推理和个性化等多个领域，Advisor Models优于静态提示优化器，能够发现环境动态并提高下游任务性能。还展示了advisor在不同黑盒模型间的可迁移性，以及在保持对分布外输入鲁棒性的同时实现专业化。

Conclusion: Advisor Models为黑盒系统提供了可学习的接口，其中advisor充当参数化、环境特定的记忆。通过Advisor Models动态优化黑盒模型是实现个性化和环境适应性AI的有前景方向。

Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly deployed as black-box services, where
model weights cannot be modified and customization is limited to prompting.
While static prompt optimization has shown promise, it produces a single fixed
prompt that fails to adapt to different inputs, users, or environments. We
introduce Advisor Models, lightweight parametric policies trained with
reinforcement learning to reactively issue natural language steering
instructions in-context to black-box models. The advisor is a second small
model that sits between the input and the model, shaping behavior on a
per-instance basis using reward signals from the environment. Across multiple
domains involving reasoning and personalization, we show that Advisor Models
outperform static prompt optimizers, discovering environment dynamics and
improving downstream task performance. We also demonstrate the generalizability
of advisors by transferring them across black-box models, as well as the
framework's ability to achieve specialization while retaining robustness to
out-of-distribution inputs. Viewed more broadly, Advisor Models provide a
learnable interface to black-box systems where the advisor acts as a
parametric, environment-specific memory. We argue that dynamic optimization of
black-box models via Advisor Models is a promising direction for enabling
personalization and environment-adaptable AI with frontier-level capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出基于预测市场的训练数据选择方法，通过市场机制自动整合多种信号，在固定计算预算下实现高效数据筛选


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统训练数据选择方法需要手动组合多种异质信号，缺乏系统化框架和透明控制参数

Method: 使用成本函数预测市场为每个样本定价，通过流动性参数控制集中度，引入价格-长度规则处理token预算，并添加轻量级多样性头提升覆盖度

Result: 在GSM8K上达到与强基线相当的性能，同时降低种子方差，选择开销小于0.1 GPU小时；在AGNews上保持竞争力的准确率并改善平衡性和稳定性

Conclusion: 该框架为多信号数据筛选提供了统一方法，在固定计算预算下适用于提示级推理和分类任务

Abstract: Selecting a small yet useful subset of training data is hard because signals
of example utility (uncertainty, rarity, diversity, etc.) are heterogeneous and
typically combined with ad hoc weights. We propose a market-based selector that
prices each example via a cost-function prediction market (LMSR), signals act
as traders, a single liquidity parameter controls concentration, and topic-wise
normalization stabilizes calibration. Token budgets are handled explicitly by a
price-per-token rule $\rho=p/\ell^{\gamma}$, with $\gamma$ exposing an
interpretable length bias; a lightweight diversity head improves coverage. We
quantify coverage via topic cluster coverage and effective sample size. On the
theory side, we show that LMSR implements a maximum-entropy aggregation with
exponential weighting and a convex objective, yielding transparent knobs for
aggregation strength. Empirically, on GSM8K (60k-token budget) the market with
diversity achieves parity with strong single-signal baselines while reducing
seed variance and incurring $<\!0.1$ GPU-hr selection overhead; on AGNews at
kept=5-25\% the market (with light balancing) delivers competitive accuracy
with improved balance and stability. The framework unifies multi-signal data
curation under fixed compute for prompt-level reasoning and classification.

Motivation: 研究PTQ在安全关键部署中可能导致的灾难性性能下降，探索输入分布特征如何引发这种下降，强调实际部署中需要谨慎。

Method: 使用知识蒸馏和强化学习来学习网络和比特宽度策略对，分析量化下的最坏情况潜在性能损失。

Result: 确认存在"有害"的网络-策略组合，多个实例显示精度下降10-65%，而稳健组合仅下降<2%。通过系统实验提供了最高脆弱点的初步探索。

Conclusion: 这是理解PTQ引入故障案例的初步步骤，强调实际部署需要谨慎，鼓励对鲁棒性进行更严格检查，并在深度学习领域更重视安全性考虑。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has recently emerged as an effective tool
for reducing the computational complexity and memory usage of a neural network
by representing its weights and activations with lower precision. While this
paradigm has shown great success in lowering compute and storage costs, there
is the potential for drastic performance reduction depending upon the
distribution of inputs experienced in inference. When considering possible
deployment in safety-critical environments, it is important to investigate the
extent of potential performance reduction, and what characteristics of input
distributions may give rise to this reduction. In this work, we explore the
idea of extreme failure stemming from dynamic PTQ and formulate a knowledge
distillation and reinforcement learning task to learn a network and bit-width
policy pair such that catastrophic failure under quantization is analyzed in
terms of worst case potential. Our results confirm the existence of this
"detrimental" network-policy pair, with several instances demonstrating
performance reductions in the range of 10-65% in accuracy, compared to their
"robust" counterparts encountering a <2% decrease. From systematic
experimentation and analyses, we also provide an initial exploration into
points at highest vulnerability. While our results represent an initial step
toward understanding failure cases introduced by PTQ, our findings ultimately
emphasize the need for caution in real-world deployment scenarios. We hope this
work encourages more rigorous examinations of robustness and a greater emphasis
on safety considerations for future works within the broader field of deep
learning.

Conclusion: SAGE提供了一个实用的、恒定内存的替代方案，补充了剪枝和模型压缩，用于高效训练。

Abstract: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally and
energy intensive. We present SAGE, a streaming data-subset selection method
that maintains a compact Frequent Directions (FD) sketch of gradient geometry
in $O(\ell D)$ memory and prioritizes examples whose sketched gradients align
with a consensus direction. The approach eliminates $N \times N$ pairwise
similarities and explicit $N \times \ell$ gradient stores, yielding a simple
two-pass, GPU-friendly pipeline. Leveraging FD's deterministic approximation
guarantees, we analyze how agreement scoring preserves gradient energy within
the principal sketched subspace. Across multiple benchmarks, SAGE trains with
small kept-rate budgets while retaining competitive accuracy relative to
full-data training and recent subset-selection baselines, and reduces
end-to-end compute and peak memory. Overall, SAGE offers a practical,
constant-memory alternative that complements pruning and model compression for
efficient training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 上下文学习器如TabPFN在生物分子效能预测中表现良好，但其性能高度依赖于提供的上下文。如何在没有真实标签的情况下选择最佳模型进行集成是一个开放问题。

Method: 使用TabPFN模型和简单序列特征，通过模型预测的分位数间范围(IQR)作为不确定性度量，选择不确定性最低的模型进行集成。

Result: TabPFN模型在siRNA敲低效能预测中超越了专门的最先进预测器，且模型的不确定性(IQR)与真实预测误差呈负相关。基于最低平均IQR的模型集成方法优于朴素集成或使用所有数据训练的单一模型。

Conclusion: 模型不确定性是一种强大的无标签启发式方法，可用于优化生物分子效能预测。

Abstract: In-context learners like TabPFN are promising for biomolecule efficacy
prediction, where established molecular feature sets and relevant experimental
results can serve as powerful contextual examples. However, their performance
is highly sensitive to the provided context, making strategies like post-hoc
ensembling of models trained on different data subsets a viable approach. An
open question is how to select the best models for the ensemble without access
to ground truth labels. In this study, we investigate an uncertainty-guided
strategy for model selection. We demonstrate on an siRNA knockdown efficacy
task that a TabPFN model using simple sequence-based features can surpass
specialized state-of-the-art predictors. We also show that the model's
predicted inter-quantile range (IQR), a measure of its uncertainty, has a
negative correlation with true prediction error. By selecting and averaging an
ensemble of models with the lowest mean IQR, we achieve superior performance
compared to naive ensembling or using a single model trained on all available
data. This finding highlights model uncertainty as a powerful, label-free
heuristic for optimizing biomolecule efficacy predictions.

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is plagued by long training times and
massive energy consumption, with modern models requiring months of computation
and gigawatt-hours of electricity. In light of these challenges,we introduce
Litespark, a novel pre-training framework that addresses these inefficiencies
through targeted optimizations to transformer attention and MLP layers. Our
approach combines architectural improvements with algorithmic enhancements to
maximize Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) while maintaining compatibility with
standard transformer implementations. Comprehensive benchmarking on 3B and 30B
parameter Llama models using the SlimPajama-627B dataset demonstrates
substantial performance gains: 2x-6x training throughput improvement and
$55\%-83$% energy consumption reduction across multi-node H200 GPU clusters.
These optimizations are model- and hardware-agnostic, enabling broad
applicability across transformer architectures and extending to post-training
phases including supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ACF的对比学习方法，直接从高维观测中发现可独立控制的潜在变量，解决了传统方法需要先验因子表示的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统因子化MDP方法需要已知因子表示，而深度强化学习虽然能处理高维输入但无法利用因子结构，需要一种能从高维观测中发现可控因子的方法。

Method: 使用对比学习方法，利用动作稀疏性（每个动作通常只影响状态变量的子集）来发现可独立控制的潜在变量。

Result: 在Taxi、FourRooms和MiniGrid-DoorKey三个基准测试中，ACF直接从像素观测中恢复了真实的可控因子，始终优于基线解缠算法。

Conclusion: ACF能够有效地从高维观测中发现可独立控制的潜在变量，为强化学习中的表示学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Algorithms that exploit factored Markov decision processes are far more
sample-efficient than factor-agnostic methods, yet they assume a factored
representation is known a priori -- a requirement that breaks down when the
agent sees only high-dimensional observations. Conversely, deep reinforcement
learning handles such inputs but cannot benefit from factored structure. We
address this representation problem with Action-Controllable Factorization
(ACF), a contrastive learning approach that uncovers independently controllable
latent variables -- state components each action can influence separately. ACF
leverages sparsity: actions typically affect only a subset of variables, while
the rest evolve under the environment's dynamics, yielding informative data for
contrastive training. ACF recovers the ground truth controllable factors
directly from pixel observations on three benchmarks with known factored
structure -- Taxi, FourRooms, and MiniGrid-DoorKey -- consistently
outperforming baseline disentanglement algorithms.

TL;DR: CHORD框架通过设备-云协作实现个性化混合精度量化，为移动设备上的序列推荐提供资源自适应部署方案，无需本地重训练即可实现动态模型适配和加速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着移动设备能力提升，在设备上直接部署重排序模型变得可行，但资源异质性需要模型压缩。现有量化方法忽视了设备特定的用户兴趣，导致推荐准确性下降，而设备端微调又带来额外的计算负担。

Method: CHORD在异构设备上分发随机初始化模型，通过云端辅助超网络模块识别用户特定的关键参数。采用多粒度参数敏感性分析（层、滤波器、元素级别），将用户画像映射到量化策略。通过设备端混合精度量化实现动态模型适配，仅用每通道2位编码量化策略来最小化通信开销。

Result: 在三个真实世界数据集和两个流行骨干网络（SASRec和Caser）上的实验证明了CHORD在准确性、效率和适应性方面的优势。

Conclusion: CHORD框架成功实现了无需反向传播的个性化混合精度量化，在保持推荐准确性的同时显著降低了通信开销和计算负担，为移动设备上的实时上下文推荐提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the advancement of mobile device capabilities, deploying reranking
models directly on devices has become feasible, enabling real-time contextual
recommendations. When migrating models from cloud to devices, resource
heterogeneity inevitably necessitates model compression. Recent quantization
methods show promise for efficient deployment, yet they overlook
device-specific user interests, resulting in compromised recommendation
accuracy. While on-device finetuning captures personalized user preference, it
imposes additional computational burden through local retraining. To address
these challenges, we propose a framework for \underline{\textbf{C}}ustomizing
\underline{\textbf{H}}ybrid-precision \underline{\textbf{O}}n-device model for
sequential \underline{\textbf{R}}ecommendation with
\underline{\textbf{D}}evice-cloud collaboration (\textbf{CHORD}), leveraging
channel-wise mixed-precision quantization to simultaneously achieve
personalization and resource-adaptive deployment. CHORD distributes randomly
initialized models across heterogeneous devices and identifies user-specific
critical parameters through auxiliary hypernetwork modules on the cloud. Our
parameter sensitivity analysis operates across multiple granularities (layer,
filter, and element levels), enabling precise mapping from user profiles to
quantization strategy. Through on-device mixed-precision quantization, CHORD
delivers dynamic model adaptation and accelerated inference without
backpropagation, eliminating costly retraining cycles. We minimize
communication overhead by encoding quantization strategies using only 2 bits
per channel instead of 32-bit weights. Experiments on three real-world datasets
with two popular backbones (SASRec and Caser) demonstrate the accuracy,
efficiency, and adaptivity of CHORD.

Motivation: DRL在处理多参数系统时具有快速学习能力，但对系统模型快速变化时性能会严重下降；而ES能处理时变系统和未知控制方向，但收敛速度慢且易陷入局部最优。

Method: 将DRL和ES结合形成混合控制器：DRL利用历史数据快速学习多参数系统控制，ES确保对时变系统的鲁棒性。

Result: 混合控制器的性能超过了单独使用DRL或ES的效果，在洛斯阿拉莫斯中子科学中心线性粒子加速器的低能束流传输段自动调谐中进行了数值研究验证。

Conclusion: DRL和ES的协同组合能够克服各自的局限性，为时变多参数系统提供既快速又鲁棒的控制解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the use of robust model independent bounded extremum
seeking (ES) feedback control to improve the robustness of deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) controllers for a class of nonlinear time-varying systems. DRL
has the potential to learn from large datasets to quickly control or optimize
the outputs of many-parameter systems, but its performance degrades
catastrophically when the system model changes rapidly over time. Bounded ES
can handle time-varying systems with unknown control directions, but its
convergence speed slows down as the number of tuned parameters increases and,
like all local adaptive methods, it can get stuck in local minima. We
demonstrate that together, DRL and bounded ES result in a hybrid controller
whose performance exceeds the sum of its parts with DRL taking advantage of
historical data to learn how to quickly control a many-parameter system to a
desired setpoint while bounded ES ensures its robustness to time variations. We
present a numerical study of a general time-varying system and a combined
ES-DRL controller for automatic tuning of the Low Energy Beam Transport section
at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center linear particle accelerator.

*Jiangnan Li,Thuy-Trang Vu,Ehsan Abbasnejad,Gholamreza Haffari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文揭示了监督微调与逆强化学习的等价性，证明SFT不仅学习策略，还学习隐式的密集token级奖励模型，并提出了从SFT模型中恢复密集奖励的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上SFT被视为简单的模仿学习，本文挑战这一观点，旨在证明SFT实际上是一种强大的奖励学习机制。

Method: 建立SFT与逆Q学习的等价性，提出基线相对奖励函数来从SFT模型中恢复密集奖励信号，并开发Dense-Path REINFORCE方法。

Result: Dense-Path REINFORCE在指令跟随基准测试中持续优于原始SFT模型。

Conclusion: SFT不仅是策略模仿，更是强大的奖励学习机制，为利用专家演示开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Conventionally, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is treated as a simple imitation
learning process that only trains a policy to imitate expert behavior on
demonstration datasets. In this work, we challenge this view by establishing a
fundamental equivalence between SFT and Inverse Reinforcement Learning. We
prove that the SFT objective is a special case of Inverse Q-Learning, which
implies that the SFT process does not just learn a policy, but also an
implicit, dense, token-level reward model that explains the expert
demonstrations. We then show how to recover this dense reward signal directly
from the SFT model by formulating a baseline-relative reward function. The
availability of such a dense reward model offers numerous benefits, providing
granular credit assignment for each token generated. We demonstrate one key
application by using these recovered rewards to further improve the policy with
reinforcement learning. Our method, Dense-Path REINFORCE, consistently
outperforms the original SFT models on instruction-following benchmarks. This
work reframes SFT not merely as policy imitation but as a powerful reward
learning mechanism, opening new possibilities for leveraging expert
demonstrations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种残差学习框架，通过在多块交叉阵列瓦片上顺序学习来补偿低精度权重更新的残差误差，解决了模拟内存计算中4位精度设备训练精度下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟内存计算加速器使用电阻交叉阵列直接在内存中进行深度神经网络计算，但实际训练需要至少8位电导状态才能匹配数字基准。许多有前景的忆阻器件如ReRAM由于制造限制只能提供约4位分辨率，这种有限的更新精度会显著降低训练精度。

Method: 提出残差学习框架，在多块交叉阵列瓦片上顺序学习，补偿低精度权重更新的残差误差。理论分析表明最优性差距随瓦片数量缩小，并实现线性收敛速率。

Result: 在标准图像分类基准测试中，该方法在有限状态设置下始终优于最先进的模拟内存训练策略，成本分析确认仅产生适度的硬件开销。

Conclusion: 该残差学习框架能够在使用有限状态器件的情况下实现片上训练，解决了模拟内存计算中低精度权重更新的精度损失问题。

Abstract: Analog in-memory computing (AIMC) accelerators enable efficient deep neural
network computation directly within memory using resistive crossbar arrays,
where model parameters are represented by the conductance states of memristive
devices. However, effective in-memory training typically requires at least
8-bit conductance states to match digital baselines. Realizing such
fine-grained states is costly and often requires complex noise mitigation
techniques that increase circuit complexity and energy consumption. In
practice, many promising memristive devices such as ReRAM offer only about
4-bit resolution due to fabrication constraints, and this limited update
precision substantially degrades training accuracy. To enable on-chip training
with these limited-state devices, this paper proposes a \emph{residual
learning} framework that sequentially learns on multiple crossbar tiles to
compensate the residual errors from low-precision weight updates. Our
theoretical analysis shows that the optimality gap shrinks with the number of
tiles and achieves a linear convergence rate. Experiments on standard image
classification benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art in-memory analog training strategies under limited-state
settings, while incurring only moderate hardware overhead as confirmed by our
cost analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Spectral Geodesic Flow Matching (SFMG)框架，利用谱特征映射将图嵌入到黎曼流形中，通过匹配测地流上的分布来生成图，在保持性能的同时实现了30倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图生成方法通常只对齐图的谱或度分布，但忽略了特征向量诱导的几何结构和图的全局结构。

Method: 使用谱特征映射将输入图和目标图嵌入到连续黎曼流形中，定义嵌入之间的测地流，并沿着这些流匹配分布以生成输出图。

Result: SFMG在图元、度数和谱指标上与最先进方法性能相当，但比基于扩散的模型快30倍，且能泛化到未见过的图规模。

Conclusion: SFMG通过将谱几何与流匹配相结合，为图合成提供了一种新方法，具有更好的几何结构捕捉能力、灵活性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Graph generation is a fundamental task with wide applications in modeling
complex systems. Although existing methods align the spectrum or degree profile
of the target graph, they often ignore the geometry induced by eigenvectors and
the global structure of the graph. In this work, we propose Spectral Geodesic
Flow Matching (SFMG), a novel framework that uses spectral eigenmaps to embed
both input and target graphs into continuous Riemannian manifolds. We then
define geodesic flows between embeddings and match distributions along these
flows to generate output graphs. Our method yields several advantages: (i)
captures geometric structure beyond eigenvalues, (ii) supports flexible
generation of diverse graphs, and (iii) scales efficiently. Empirically, SFMG
matches the performance of state-of-the-art approaches on graphlet, degree, and
spectral metrics across diverse benchmarks. In particular, it achieves up to
30$\times$ speedup over diffusion-based models, offering a substantial
advantage in scalability and training efficiency. We also demonstrate its
ability to generalize to unseen graph scales. Overall, SFMG provides a new
approach to graph synthesis by integrating spectral geometry with flow
matching.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于动物间变换类(IATC)的模型-大脑比较方法，通过双向映射评估神经网络模型能否作为典型大脑受试者的机制模型，解决了模型预测性与机制准确性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在比较模型激活与大脑响应时缺乏共识，需要一种既能准确预测神经活动又能识别机制细节的比较方法。

Method: 使用IATC（动物间变换类）作为比较基准，通过双向映射评估模型能否像真实受试者一样被变换函数映射，在模拟神经网络、小鼠和人类受试者群体中识别IATC。

Result: IATC能够解析神经机制的细节特征（如非线性激活函数），准确预测神经活动，同时实现高特异性的机制识别，能够区分不同脑区的响应模式。

Conclusion: IATC证明了模型预测性与机制准确性之间不存在固有权衡，为地形深度神经网络作为视觉系统模型提供了新证据，改进了模型-大脑比较方法。

Abstract: Artificial neural network models have emerged as promising mechanistic models
of the brain. However, there is little consensus on the correct method for
comparing model activations to brain responses. Drawing on recent work in
philosophy of neuroscience, we propose a comparison methodology based on the
Inter-Animal Transform Class (IATC) - the strictest set of functions needed to
accurately map neural responses between subjects in an animal population. Using
the IATC, we can map bidirectionally between a candidate model's responses and
brain data, assessing how well the model can masquerade as a typical subject
using the same kinds of transforms needed to map across real subjects. We
identify the IATC in three settings: a simulated population of neural network
models, a population of mouse subjects, and a population of human subjects. We
find that the IATC resolves detailed aspects of the neural mechanism, such as
the non-linear activation function. Most importantly, we find that the IATC
enables accurate predictions of neural activity while also achieving high
specificity in mechanism identification, evidenced by its ability to separate
response patterns from different brain areas while strongly aligning
same-brain-area responses between subjects. In other words, the IATC is a
proof-by-existence that there is no inherent tradeoff between the neural
engineering goal of high model-brain predictivity and the neuroscientific goal
of identifying mechanistically accurate brain models. Using IATC-guided
transforms, we obtain new evidence in favor of topographical deep neural
networks (TDANNs) as models of the visual system. Overall, the IATC enables
principled model-brain comparisons, contextualizing previous findings about the
predictive success of deep learning models of the brain, while improving upon
previous approaches to model-brain comparison.

Motivation: 开发能够同时处理纵向可穿戴数据的时序表示学习、结果预测和行为亚型识别的统一框架，提供临床可解释的风险分析。

Method: 使用注意力GRU自编码器联合优化三个目标：序列重构学习紧凑潜在表示、二元分类预测抑郁率、GMM软聚类识别行为亚型。

Result: 在372名参与者数据上，聚类质量（轮廓系数0.70 vs 0.32-0.70）和抑郁分类（AUC 0.74 vs 0.50-0.67）均优于基线；332名参与者的外部验证确认了可重复性。

Conclusion: AttentiveGRUAE在纵向可穿戴数据分析中表现出色，提供临床可解释的亚型分析和时间注意力可视化，有助于理解睡眠规律变化与抑郁风险的关系。

Abstract: In this study, we present AttentiveGRUAE, a novel attention-based gated
recurrent unit (GRU) autoencoder designed for temporal clustering and
prediction of outcome from longitudinal wearable data. Our model jointly
optimizes three objectives: (1) learning a compact latent representation of
daily behavioral features via sequence reconstruction, (2) predicting
end-of-period depression rate through a binary classification head, and (3)
identifying behavioral subtypes through Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based soft
clustering of learned embeddings. We evaluate AttentiveGRUAE on longitudinal
sleep data from 372 participants (GLOBEM 2018-2019), and it demonstrates
superior performance over baseline clustering, domain-aligned self-supervised,
and ablated models in both clustering quality (silhouette score = 0.70 vs
0.32-0.70) and depression classification (AUC = 0.74 vs 0.50-0.67).
Additionally, external validation on cross-year cohorts from 332 participants
(GLOBEM 2020-2021) confirms cluster reproducibility (silhouette score = 0.63,
AUC = 0.61) and stability. We further perform subtype analysis and visualize
temporal attention, which highlights sleep-related differences between clusters
and identifies salient time windows that align with changes in sleep
regularity, yielding clinically interpretable explanations of risk.

TL;DR: 提出HOD-GNN方法，通过利用高阶节点导数来增强MPNN的表达能力，理论证明其表达能力与WL层次结构对齐，并在图学习基准上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管图神经网络取得了显著进展，但其有限表达能力仍然是一个基本挑战。现有的GNN表达能力研究产生了许多表达性架构，但节点特征的导数作为增强GNN表达能力的手段尚未被探索。

Method: 引入高阶导数GNN（HOD-GNN），通过利用基础模型的高阶节点导数来增强消息传递神经网络（MPNN）的表达能力。这些导数生成表达性的结构感知节点嵌入，由第二个GNN在端到端可训练架构中处理。

Result: 理论证明HOD-GNN架构族的表达能力与WL层次结构对齐，并与子图GNN和流行的结构编码方案建立了深度联系。在流行的图学习基准上评估显示HOD-GNN在常见图学习任务中表现强劲。

Conclusion: 节点导数提供了一种增强GNN表达能力的自然方式，HOD-GNN方法在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了模型表达能力，在图学习任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), their limited
expressivity remains a fundamental challenge. Research on GNN expressivity has
produced many expressive architectures, leading to architecture hierarchies
with models of increasing expressive power. Separately, derivatives of GNNs
with respect to node features have been widely studied in the context of the
oversquashing and over-smoothing phenomena, GNN explainability, and more. To
date, these derivatives remain unexplored as a means to enhance GNN
expressivity. In this paper, we show that these derivatives provide a natural
way to enhance the expressivity of GNNs. We introduce High-Order Derivative GNN
(HOD-GNN), a novel method that enhances the expressivity of Message Passing
Neural Networks (MPNNs) by leveraging high-order node derivatives of the base
model. These derivatives generate expressive structure-aware node embeddings
processed by a second GNN in an end-to-end trainable architecture.
Theoretically, we show that the resulting architecture family's expressive
power aligns with the WL hierarchy. We also draw deep connections between
HOD-GNN, Subgraph GNNs, and popular structural encoding schemes. For
computational efficiency, we develop a message-passing algorithm for computing
high-order derivatives of MPNNs that exploits graph sparsity and parallelism.
Evaluations on popular graph learning benchmarks demonstrate HOD-GNN's strong
performance on popular graph learning tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have been supported by the emergence of
domain-specific software libraries, enabling streamlined workflows and
increased reproducibility. For geospatial machine learning (GeoML), the
availability of Earth observation data has outpaced the development of domain
libraries to handle its unique challenges, such as varying spatial resolutions,

TL;DR: MINTO是一种新的深度强化学习方法，通过在目标网络和在线网络之间选择最小值作为目标估计，实现了快速稳定的价值函数学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标网络方法虽然稳定但学习缓慢，而直接使用在线网络作为目标会导致学习不稳定。MINTO旨在结合两者的优点。

Method: 引入新的更新规则，使用目标网络和在线网络之间的最小值作为目标估计，可以无缝集成到各种基于价值和行动者-评论者算法中。

Result: 在在线和离线强化学习、离散和连续动作空间等多种基准测试中，MINTO始终提高性能表现。

Conclusion: MINTO通过简单的修改实现了快速稳定的价值函数学习，具有广泛的适用性和有效性。

Abstract: The use of target networks is a popular approach for estimating value
functions in deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). While effective, the target
network remains a compromise solution that preserves stability at the cost of
slowly moving targets, thus delaying learning. Conversely, using the online
network as a bootstrapped target is intuitively appealing, albeit well-known to
lead to unstable learning. In this work, we aim to obtain the best out of both
worlds by introducing a novel update rule that computes the target using the
MINimum estimate between the Target and Online network, giving rise to our
method, MINTO. Through this simple, yet effective modification, we show that
MINTO enables faster and stable value function learning, by mitigating the
potential overestimation bias of using the online network for bootstrapping.
Notably, MINTO can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of value-based
and actor-critic algorithms with a negligible cost. We evaluate MINTO
extensively across diverse benchmarks, spanning online and offline RL, as well
as discrete and continuous action spaces. Across all benchmarks, MINTO
consistently improves performance, demonstrating its broad applicability and
effectiveness.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: While many modern studies are dedicated to ML-based large-sample hydrologic
modeling, these efforts have not necessarily translated into predictive
improvements that are grounded in enhanced physical-conceptual understanding.
Here, we report on a CONUS-wide large-sample study (spanning diverse
hydro-geo-climatic conditions) using ML-augmented physically-interpretable
catchment-scale models of varying complexity based in the Mass-Conserving
Perceptron (MCP). Results were evaluated using attribute masks such as snow
regime, forest cover, and climate zone. Our results indicate the importance of
selecting model architectures of appropriate model complexity based on how
process dominance varies with hydrological regime. Benchmark comparisons show
that physically-interpretable mass-conserving MCP-based models can achieve
performance comparable to data-based models based in the Long Short-Term Memory
network (LSTM) architecture. Overall, this study highlights the potential of a
theory-informed, physically grounded approach to large-sample hydrology, with
emphasis on mechanistic understanding and the development of parsimonious and
interpretable model architectures, thereby laying the foundation for future
models of everywhere that architecturally encode information about spatially-
and temporally-varying process dominance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了CLEAR方法，首次对transformer架构的核心组件进行细粒度推理能耗分析，发现注意力块的每FLOP能耗显著更高，表明FLOP计数无法准确反映组件级真实能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM推理在全球范围内持续进行，已成为AI能耗的主要来源，但现有可持续性研究仅报告粗粒度的模型级指标，缺乏细粒度测量方法，将能效视为次要目标而非主要目标。

Method: 提出CLEAR方法，通过重复采样克服微秒级组件执行与毫秒级能耗传感器监测之间的时间不匹配问题，评估了涵盖四种架构类型的15个模型。

Result: CLEAR方法能将组件级能耗方差保持在9.5%以下，捕获超过90%的模型总能耗作为单个组件。注意力块每FLOP能耗显著更高，表明能耗与FLOP计数不成比例。

Conclusion: 研究建立了详细的组件级能耗基准，为通过组件级优化构建节能transformer模型提供了初步见解。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised significant
environmental concerns. Unlike the one-time cost of training, LLM inference
occurs continuously at a global scale and now dominates the AI energy
footprint. Yet, most sustainability studies report only coarse, model-level
metrics due to the lack of fine-grained measurement methods, treating energy
efficiency more as an afterthought than as a primary objective. We present the
first fine-grained empirical analysis of inference energy across core
components of transformer architecture. We propose a novel methodology,
Component-Level Energy Assessment via Repeated sampling (CLEAR), to overcome
temporal mismatch between microsecond scale component execution and monitoring
of millisecond (ms) scale energy sensors. Using CLEAR, we evaluate 15 models
spanning four distinct architecture types and consistently keep component-wise
energy variance below 9.5\% while capturing more than 90\% of the model's total
energy as individual components. Our empirical analysis reveals that Attention
blocks consume significantly more energy per floating-point operation (FLOP),
indicating that energy consumption is not proportionally aligned with FLOP
counts. This shows that FLOPs alone fail to capture the true energy cost at a
component level. Our findings establish detailed component-level energy
baselines and provide insight as an initial step to build energy-efficient
transformer models through component-level optimizations.

Conclusion: MINERVA方法能够有效处理现有方法难以捕捉的高阶特征交互问题，在特征选择任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Existing feature filters rely on statistical pair-wise dependence metrics to
model feature-target relationships, but this approach may fail when the target
depends on higher-order feature interactions rather than individual
contributions. We introduce Mutual Information Neural Estimation Regularized
Vetting Algorithm (MINERVA), a novel approach to supervised feature selection
based on neural estimation of mutual information between features and targets.
We paramaterize the approximation of mutual information with neural networks
and perform feature selection using a carefully designed loss function
augmented with sparsity-inducing regularizers. Our method is implemented in a
two-stage process to decouple representation learning from feature selection,
ensuring better generalization and a more accurate expression of feature
importance. We present examples of ubiquitous dependency structures that are
rarely captured in literature and show that our proposed method effectively
captures these complex feature-target relationships by evaluating feature
subsets as an ensemble. Experimental results on synthetic and real-life fraud
datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method and its ability to perform
exact solutions.

Abstract: Missing data is a pervasive problem in tabular settings. Existing solutions
range from simple averaging to complex generative adversarial networks.
However, due to huge variance in performance across real-world domains and

Building on TabPFN, a recent tabular foundation model for supervised learning,
we propose TabImpute, a pre-trained transformer that delivers accurate and fast

featurization for tabular settings, which enables a $100\times$ speedup over
the previous TabPFN imputation method, (ii) a synthetic training data
generation pipeline incorporating realistic missingness patterns, which boosts
test-time performance, and (iii) MissBench, a comprehensive benchmark for
evaluation of imputation methods with $42$ OpenML datasets and $13$ missingness

TL;DR: HyperAdaLoRA是一种基于超网络的参数高效微调方法，通过注意力机制动态生成SVD参数，加速AdaLoRA的收敛速度而不牺牲性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AdaLoRA虽然通过SVD和动态秩分配提升了LoRA的适应性，但在训练过程中存在收敛速度慢和计算开销高的问题。

Method: 使用基于注意力机制的超网络动态生成SVD参数(P, Λ, Q)，并通过剪裁超网络输出的奇异值实现动态秩分配。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上的实验表明，该方法实现了更快的收敛速度，且性能不下降。在其他基于LoRA的方法上的扩展实验验证了其广泛适用性。

Conclusion: HyperAdaLoRA通过超网络有效解决了AdaLoRA收敛慢的问题，为参数高效微调提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), especially Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), has emerged as a promising approach to fine-tuning large language
models(LLMs) while reducing computational and memory overhead. However, LoRA
assumes a uniform rank \textit{r} for each incremental matrix, not accounting
for the varying significance of weight matrices across different modules and
layers. AdaLoRA leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to parameterize
updates and employs pruning of singular values to introduce dynamic rank
allocation, thereby enhancing adaptability. However, during the training
process, it often encounters issues of slow convergence speed and high
computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose HyperAdaLoRA, a novel
framework that accelerates the convergence of AdaLoRA by leveraging a
hypernetwork. Instead of directly optimizing the components of Singular Value
Decomposition $(P, \Lambda, Q)$, HyperAdaLoRA employs a hypernetwork based on
attention mechanisms to dynamically generate these parameters. By pruning the
outputs of the hypernetwork that generates the singular values, dynamic rank
allocation is achieved. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets and
models demonstrate that our method achieves faster convergence without
sacrificing performance. Additionally, further extension experiments on other

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于对抗自编码器的无监督深度学习框架，用于优化桥梁巡检车辆的动态特性，以提高桥梁损伤检测的灵敏度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的车载巡检方法中，车辆的机械和动态特性显著影响损伤检测性能，限制了该方法的有效性。

Method: 使用对抗自编码器重构加速度响应的频域表示，通过最小化健康与损伤状态下损伤指数分布的Wasserstein距离来优化车辆轮胎悬挂系统的质量和刚度，并采用Kriging元模型高效逼近目标函数。

Result: 结果显示，相对于桥梁第一固有频率的频率比在0.3-0.7之间的车辆最有效，接近共振的车辆性能较差。较轻的车辆需要较低的固有频率以获得最佳检测效果。

Conclusion: 这是首个严格优化车载传感平台并提出了专用巡检车辆的研究。

Abstract: Drive-by inspection for bridge health monitoring has gained increasing
attention over the past decade. This method involves analysing the coupled
vehicle-bridge response, recorded by an instrumented inspection vehicle, to
assess structural integrity and detect damage. However, the vehicles mechanical
and dynamic properties significantly influence detection performance, limiting
the effectiveness of the approach. This study presents a framework for
optimising the inspection vehicle to enhance damage sensitivity. An
unsupervised deep learning methodbased on adversarial autoencoders (AAE)is used
to reconstruct the frequency-domain representation of acceleration responses.
The mass and stiffness of the tyre suspension system of a two-axle vehicle are
optimised by minimising the Wasserstein distance between damage index
distributions for healthy and damaged bridge states. A Kriging meta-model is
employed to approximate this objective function efficiently and identify
optimal vehicle configurations in both dimensional and non-dimensional
parameter spaces. Results show that vehicles with frequency ratios between 0.3
and 0.7 relative to the bridges' first natural frequency are most effective,
while those near resonance perform poorly. Lighter vehicles require lower
natural frequencies for optimal detection. This is the first study to
rigorously optimise the sensing platform for drive-by sensing and to propose a
purpose-built inspection vehicle.

TL;DR: TutorBench是一个用于评估LLMs辅导能力的基准数据集，包含1,490个专家标注的样本，涵盖自适应解释、反馈提供和提示生成三个核心辅导任务。评估显示前沿LLMs在辅导技能方面仍有很大改进空间，最高得分不超过56%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着学生越来越多地使用LLMs作为学习辅助工具，需要开发能够处理辅导复杂性的模型，包括识别学生核心需求、提供自适应和个性化指导，并确保准确性。

Method: 构建了包含1,490个高中和AP课程样本的数据集，涵盖三个辅导任务：自适应解释、反馈提供和提示生成。使用样本特定的评分标准和LLM评判器进行自动评估。

Result: 评估了16个前沿LLMs，结果显示所有模型得分均不超过56%，在指导、诊断和支持学生方面的评分标准通过率均低于60%。不同模型家族表现出不同的优势和局限。

Conclusion: TutorBench提供了一个全面且未饱和的基准，可指导下一代AI辅导系统的开发，当前LLMs在展示完整辅导技能方面仍有不足。

Abstract: As students increasingly adopt large language models (LLMs) as learning aids,
it is crucial to build models that are adept at handling the nuances of
tutoring: they need to identify the core needs of students, be adaptive,
provide personalized guidance, and be accurate. To this end, we introduce
TutorBench, a dataset and evaluation benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate
the core tutoring skills of LLMs. The dataset comprises 1,490 samples curated
by human experts, focused on high-school and AP-level curricula. The samples
are drawn from three common tutoring tasks: (i) generating adaptive
explanations tailored to a student's confusion, (ii) providing actionable
feedback on a student's work, and (iii) promoting active learning through
effective hint generation. To account for the inherent complexity of tutoring,
samples are accompanied by sample-specific rubrics which are used to judge
model responses during evaluation. TutorBench uses a reliable and fine-grained
automatic evaluation method that uses an LLM-judge and the sample-specific
rubrics. We evaluate 16 frontier LLMs on TutorBench and present a detailed
analysis of their performance and behavior. Our results show that none of the
frontier LLMs achieve a score of greater than $56\%$, showing a large room for
improvement. We find that LLMs fall short in exhibiting the full range of
tutoring skills needed to guide, diagnose, and support students effectively,
with all the frontier models achieving less than a $60\%$ pass rate on rubric
criteria related to these skills. We also find that different model families
exhibit varied strengths and limitations: the Claude models outperform others
in supporting active learning, while they lag behind in the other two use
cases. By releasing TutorBench, we provide a comprehensive and unsaturated
benchmark to guide the development of the next-generation of AI tutors.

TL;DR: 该论文证明了对于一类置换等变学习规则，训练过程在神经元之间诱导了双利普希茨映射，并强约束了神经元分布的拓扑结构。学习率η存在一个拓扑临界点η*：当η<η*时训练保持所有拓扑结构；当η>η*时允许拓扑简化，降低模型表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究学习率对神经网络训练过程中神经元拓扑结构的影响，揭示学习动力学中的拓扑约束机制。

Method: 通过分析置换等变学习规则（包括SGD、Adam等）在训练过程中诱导的双利普希茨映射，研究神经元分布的拓扑结构变化。

Result: 发现学习率存在拓扑临界点η*：低于η*时拓扑结构完全保持，高于η*时允许拓扑简化，使神经元流形逐渐粗糙化。结合边缘稳定性现象，学习动力学可分为两个阶段：拓扑约束下的平滑优化和拓扑简化学习。

Conclusion: 该理论独立于特定架构或损失函数，使得拓扑方法能够普遍应用于深度学习研究，揭示了学习率对神经网络表达能力的重要影响。

Abstract: We prove that for a broad class of permutation-equivariant learning rules
(including SGD, Adam, and others), the training process induces a bi-Lipschitz
mapping between neurons and strongly constrains the topology of the neuron
distribution during training. This result reveals a qualitative difference
between small and large learning rates $\eta$. With a learning rate below a
topological critical point $\eta^*$, the training is constrained to preserve
all topological structure of the neurons. In contrast, above $\eta^*$, the
learning process allows for topological simplification, making the neuron
manifold progressively coarser and thereby reducing the model's expressivity.
Viewed in combination with the recent discovery of the edge of stability
phenomenon, the learning dynamics of neuron networks under gradient descent can
be divided into two phases: first they undergo smooth optimization under
topological constraints, and then enter a second phase where they learn through
drastic topological simplifications. A key feature of our theory is that it is
independent of specific architectures or loss functions, enabling the universal
application of topological methods to the study of deep learning.

Conclusion: 指数集中是训练模型的统计规律，为FP8时代的无损低精度浮点设计开辟了原则性路径。

Abstract: The scaling of Generative AI (GenAI) models into the hundreds of billions of
parameters makes low-precision computation indispensable for efficient
deployment. We argue that the fundamental solution lies in developing
low-precision floating-point formats, which inherently provide numerical
stability, memory savings, and hardware efficiency without dequantization
overhead. In this paper, we present a theoretical and empirical study of an
exponent concentration phenomenon in GenAI weights: exponents consistently
exhibit low entropy across architectures and modalities. We show that this
arises naturally from $\alpha$-stable distributions induced by stochastic
gradient descent, and we prove tight bounds on the entropy of exponents. Our
analysis establishes a theoretical compression limit near FP4.67, which
motivates the design of a practical FP8 format. Building on these insights, we
propose Exponent-Concentrated FP8 (ECF8), a lossless compression framework with
entropy-aware encoding and GPU-optimized decoding. Experiments on LLMs and DiTs
up to 671B parameters demonstrate up to 26.9% memory savings and 177.1%
throughput acceleration, with perfectly lossless computations, i.e., no
deviation in model outputs. Our results establish exponent concentration as a
statistical law of trained models and open a principled path for lossless
low-precision floating-point design in the FP8 era.

Abstract: Recently, neural operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning
mappings between function spaces, enabling data-driven simulations of complex
dynamics. Despite their successes, a deeper understanding of their learning
mechanisms remains underexplored. In this work, we classify neural operators
into two types: (1) Spatial domain models that learn on grids and (2)
Functional domain models that learn with function bases. We present several
viewpoints based on this classification and focus on learning data-driven
dynamics adhering to physical principles. Specifically, we provide a way to
explain the prediction-making process of neural operators and show that neural
operator can learn hidden physical patterns from data. However, this
explanation method is limited to specific situations, highlighting the urgent
need for generalizable explanation methods. Next, we show that a simple
dual-space multi-scale model can achieve SOTA performance and we believe that
dual-space multi-spatio-scale models hold significant potential to learn
complex physics and require further investigation. Lastly, we discuss the
critical need for principled frameworks to incorporate known physics into
neural operators, enabling better generalization and uncovering more hidden
physical phenomena.

Conclusion: 通过结合GP的符号推理能力和LLMs的解释生成能力，EvoSpeak推进了智能、透明、用户对齐的启发式算法开发。

Abstract: Genetic programming (GP) has demonstrated strong effectiveness in evolving
tree-structured heuristics for complex optimization problems. Yet, in dynamic
and large-scale scenarios, the most effective heuristics are often highly
complex, hindering interpretability, slowing convergence, and limiting
transferability across tasks. To address these challenges, we present EvoSpeak,
a novel framework that integrates GP with large language models (LLMs) to
enhance the efficiency, transparency, and adaptability of heuristic evolution.
EvoSpeak learns from high-quality GP heuristics, extracts knowledge, and
leverages this knowledge to (i) generate warm-start populations that accelerate
convergence, (ii) translate opaque GP trees into concise natural-language
explanations that foster interpretability and trust, and (iii) enable knowledge
transfer and preference-aware heuristic generation across related tasks. We
verify the effectiveness of EvoSpeak through extensive experiments on dynamic
flexible job shop scheduling (DFJSS), under both single- and multi-objective
formulations. The results demonstrate that EvoSpeak produces more effective
heuristics, improves evolutionary efficiency, and delivers human-readable
reports that enhance usability. By coupling the symbolic reasoning power of GP
with the interpretative and generative strengths of LLMs, EvoSpeak advances the
development of intelligent, transparent, and user-aligned heuristics for
real-world optimization problems.

Motivation: 扩散模型虽然能有效捕捉训练数据分布，但需要根据下游应用使用奖励函数来塑造这些分布。现有策略梯度方法（如PPO）在扩散模型中因边际似然难以计算而受限。

Method: 1. 将RAFT变体统一为GRAFT框架；2. 引入P-GRAFT在中间噪声级别塑造分布；3. 提出逆噪声校正方法改进流模型。

Result: 在文本到图像生成、布局生成、分子生成和无条件图像生成等任务上验证。Stable Diffusion 2在T2I基准上VQAScore优于策略梯度方法，相对基础模型提升8.81%。无条件图像生成中，逆噪声校正以更低FLOPs/图像改善了FID。

Conclusion: GRAFT框架有效解决了扩散模型分布塑造问题，P-GRAFT通过中间噪声级别优化提升了微调效果，逆噪声校正为无显式奖励的模型改进提供了新途径。

Abstract: Diffusion models are widely used for generative tasks across domains. While
pre-trained diffusion models effectively capture the training data
distribution, it is often desirable to shape these distributions using reward
functions to align with downstream applications. Policy gradient methods, such
as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), are widely used in the context of
autoregressive generation. However, the marginal likelihoods required for such
methods are intractable for diffusion models, leading to alternative proposals
and relaxations. In this context, we unify variants of Rejection sAmpling based
Fine-Tuning (RAFT) as GRAFT, and show that this implicitly performs PPO with
reshaped rewards. We then introduce P-GRAFT to shape distributions at
intermediate noise levels and demonstrate empirically that this can lead to
more effective fine-tuning. We mathematically explain this via a bias-variance
tradeoff. Motivated by this, we propose inverse noise correction to improve
flow models without leveraging explicit rewards. We empirically evaluate our
methods on text-to-image(T2I) generation, layout generation, molecule
generation and unconditional image generation. Notably, our framework, applied
to Stable Diffusion 2, improves over policy gradient methods on popular T2I
benchmarks in terms of VQAScore and shows an $8.81\%$ relative improvement over
the base model. For unconditional image generation, inverse noise correction
improves FID of generated images at lower FLOPs/image.

Motivation: 在安全关键领域，离线强化学习需要既能提供高回报又避免灾难性风险的策略。现有风险规避方法过于保守且限制策略类别，而表达性策略仅用于风险中性设置。

Method: RAMAC框架耦合表达性生成actor与分布critic，通过生成路径区分组合目标（分布风险和BC损失），在复杂多模态场景中实现风险敏感学习。

Result: 在大多数Stochastic-D4RL任务上，RAMAC在保持强回报的同时，在CVaR0.1指标上获得一致增益。

Conclusion: RAMAC框架成功解决了离线强化学习中风险敏感与策略表达性之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: In safety-critical domains where online data collection is infeasible,
offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers an attractive alternative but only
if policies deliver high returns without incurring catastrophic lower-tail
risk. Prior work on risk-averse offline RL achieves safety at the cost of value
conservatism and restricted policy classes, whereas expressive policies are
only used in risk-neutral settings. Here, we address this gap by introducing
the \textbf{Risk-Aware Multimodal Actor-Critic (RAMAC)} framework, which
couples an \emph{expressive generative actor} with a distributional critic. The
RAMAC differentiates composite objective combining distributional risk and BC
loss through the generative path, achieving risk-sensitive learning in complex
multimodal scenarios. We instantiate RAMAC with diffusion and flow-matching
actors and observe consistent gains in $\mathrm{CVaR}_{0.1}$ while maintaining
strong returns on most Stochastic-D4RL tasks. Code:

Abstract: The growing integration of drones across commercial, industrial, and civilian
domains has introduced significant cybersecurity challenges, particularly due
to the susceptibility of drone networks to a wide range of cyberattacks.
Existing intrusion detection mechanisms often lack the adaptability,
efficiency, and generalizability required for the dynamic and resource

Abstract: Hyperparameters greatly impact models' capabilities; however, modern models
are too large for extensive search. Instead, researchers design recipes that
train well across scales based on their understanding of the hyperparameters.
Despite this importance, few tools exist for understanding the hyperparameter
loss surface. We discover novel structure in it and propose a new theory
yielding such tools. The loss surface is complex, but as you approach the
optimum simple structure emerges. It becomes characterized by a few basic
features, like its effective dimension and the best possible loss. To uncover
this asymptotic regime, we develop a novel technique based on random search.
Within this regime, the best scores from random search take on a new
distribution we discover. Its parameters are exactly the features defining the
loss surface in the asymptotic regime. From these features, we derive a new
asymptotic law for random search that can explain and extrapolate its
convergence. These new tools enable new analyses, such as confidence intervals
for the best possible performance or determining the effective number of
hyperparameters. We make these tools available at

Abstract: Deep time series forecasting has emerged as a booming direction in recent
years. Despite the exponential growth of community interests, researchers are
sometimes confused about the direction of their efforts due to minor
improvements on standard benchmarks. In this paper, we notice that, unlike
image recognition, whose well-acknowledged and realizable goal is 100%
accuracy, time series forecasting inherently faces a non-zero error lower bound
due to its partially observable and uncertain nature. To pinpoint the research
objective and release researchers from saturated tasks, this paper focuses on a
fundamental question: how to estimate the performance upper bound of deep time
series forecasting? Going beyond classical series-wise predictability metrics,
e.g., ADF test, we realize that the forecasting performance is highly related
to window-wise properties because of the sequence-to-sequence forecasting
paradigm of deep time series models. Based on rigorous statistical tests of
over 2,800 newly trained deep forecasters, we discover a significant
exponential relationship between the minimum forecasting error of deep models
and the complexity of window-wise series patterns, which is termed the accuracy
law. The proposed accuracy law successfully guides us to identify saturated
tasks from widely used benchmarks and derives an effective training strategy
for large time series models, offering valuable insights for future research.

Abstract: Gradient descent has proven to be a powerful and effective technique for
optimization in numerous machine learning applications. Recent advances in
computational neuroscience have shown that learning in standard gradient
descent optimization formulation is not consistent with learning in biological
systems. This has opened up interesting avenues for building biologically
inspired learning techniques. One such approach is inspired by Dale's law,
which states that inhibitory and excitatory synapses do not swap roles during
the course of learning. The resulting exponential gradient descent optimization
scheme leads to log-normally distributed synaptic weights. Interestingly, the
density that satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to the
stochastic differential equation (SDE) with geometric Brownian motion (GBM) is
the log-normal density. Leveraging this connection, we start with the SDE
governing geometric Brownian motion, and show that discretizing the
corresponding reverse-time SDE yields a multiplicative update rule, which
surprisingly, coincides with the sampling equivalent of the exponential
gradient descent update founded on Dale's law. Furthermore, we propose a new
formalism for multiplicative denoising score-matching, subsuming the loss
function proposed by Hyvaerinen for non-negative data. Indeed, log-normally
distributed data is positive and the proposed score-matching formalism turns
out to be a natural fit. This allows for training of score-based models for
image data and results in a novel multiplicative update scheme for sample
generation starting from a log-normal density. Experimental results on MNIST,
Fashion MNIST, and Kuzushiji datasets demonstrate generative capability of the
new scheme. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of a
biologically inspired generative model employing multiplicative updates,
founded on geometric Brownian motion.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的鲁棒属性图聚类方法RAGC，通过混合协作增强和对比样本自适应差异感知来解决现有方法在节点和边级别嵌入增强以及对比样本处理方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比属性图聚类方法主要依赖边作为辅助信息获取节点级嵌入表示，仅关注节点级嵌入增强，忽视了边级嵌入增强以及不同粒度下节点级和边级嵌入增强之间的交互作用。同时，这些方法往往平等对待所有对比样本对，忽略了难易正负样本对之间的显著差异，限制了其判别能力。

Method: 提出RAGC方法，包含混合协作增强和对比样本自适应差异感知两个核心模块：1）同时执行节点级和边级嵌入表示与增强，建立更全面的相似性度量标准；2）利用高置信度伪标签信息设计CSADA策略，自适应识别所有对比样本对并通过创新权重调制函数进行差异化处理。两个模块形成良性循环相互促进。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上的综合图聚类评估表明，所提出的RAGC方法相对于几种最先进的CAGC方法具有显著的有效性。

Conclusion: RAGC方法通过混合协作增强和对比样本自适应差异感知，有效提升了表示学习的判别能力，在属性图聚类任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Due to its powerful capability of self-supervised representation learning and
clustering, contrastive attributed graph clustering (CAGC) has achieved great
success, which mainly depends on effective data augmentation and contrastive
objective setting. However, most CAGC methods utilize edges as auxiliary
information to obtain node-level embedding representation and only focus on
node-level embedding augmentation. This approach overlooks edge-level embedding
augmentation and the interactions between node-level and edge-level embedding
augmentations across various granularity. Moreover, they often treat all
contrastive sample pairs equally, neglecting the significant differences
between hard and easy positive-negative sample pairs, which ultimately limits
their discriminative capability. To tackle these issues, a novel robust
attributed graph clustering (RAGC), incorporating hybrid-collaborative
augmentation (HCA) and contrastive sample adaptive-differential awareness
(CSADA), is proposed. First, node-level and edge-level embedding
representations and augmentations are simultaneously executed to establish a
more comprehensive similarity measurement criterion for subsequent contrastive
learning. In turn, the discriminative similarity further consciously guides
edge augmentation. Second, by leveraging pseudo-label information with high
confidence, a CSADA strategy is elaborately designed, which adaptively
identifies all contrastive sample pairs and differentially treats them by an
innovative weight modulation function. The HCA and CSADA modules mutually
reinforce each other in a beneficent cycle, thereby enhancing discriminability
in representation learning. Comprehensive graph clustering evaluations over six
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RAGC against
several state-of-the-art CAGC methods.

TL;DR: TokenFlow是一个新颖的LLM服务系统，通过抢占式请求调度和主动KV缓存管理来提升文本流性能，显著提高有效吞吐量并降低首令牌延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时LLM交互需要流式令牌生成，但标准LLM服务系统因非抢占式请求调度和被动内存管理导致资源利用率低、请求处理并行度差，特别是在请求突发时表现不佳。

Method: TokenFlow采用抢占式请求调度，基于实时令牌缓冲区占用率和令牌消耗率动态优先处理请求，同时主动在GPU和CPU内存间传输KV缓存，并通过I/O与计算重叠来最小化请求抢占开销。

Result: 在Llama3-8B和Qwen2.5-32B模型及多种GPU上的实验表明，TokenFlow可实现高达82.5%的有效吞吐量提升，同时将P99 TTFT降低高达80.2%，且不影响整体令牌吞吐量。

Conclusion: TokenFlow通过创新的调度和缓存管理策略，显著改善了LLM服务的流式性能，在保持高吞吐量的同时大幅降低了响应延迟。

Abstract: Real-time LLM interactions demand streamed token generations, where text
tokens are progressively generated and delivered to users while balancing two
objectives: responsiveness (i.e., low time-to-first-token) and steady
generation (i.e.,required time-between-tokens). Standard LLM serving systems
suffer from the inflexibility caused by non-preemptive request scheduling and
reactive memory management, leading to poor resource utilization and low
request processing parallelism under request bursts. Therefore, we present
TokenFlow, a novel LLM serving system with enhanced text streaming performance
via preemptive request scheduling and proactive key-value (KV) cache
management. TokenFlow dynamically prioritizes requests based on real-time token
buffer occupancy and token consumption rate, while actively transferring KV
cache between GPU and CPU memory in the background and overlapping I/O with
computation to minimize request preemption overhead. Extensive experiments on
Llama3-8B and Qwen2.5-32B across multiple GPUs (RTX 4090, A6000, H200)
demonstrate that TokenFlow achieves up to 82.5% higher effective throughput
(accounting for actual user consumption) while reducing P99 TTFT by up to
80.2%, without degrading overall token throughput.

Abstract: We present a self-supervised machine learning framework for detecting and
mapping harmful algal bloom (HAB) severity and speciation using multi-sensor
satellite data. By fusing reflectance data from operational instruments (VIIRS,
MODIS, Sentinel-3, PACE) with TROPOMI solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), our
framework, called SIT-FUSE, generates HAB severity and speciation products
without requiring per-instrument labeled datasets. The framework employs
self-supervised representation learning, hierarchical deep clustering to
segment phytoplankton concentrations and speciations into interpretable
classes, validated against in-situ data from the Gulf of Mexico and Southern
California (2018-2025). Results show strong agreement with total phytoplankton,
Karenia brevis, Alexandrium spp., and Pseudo-nitzschia spp. measurements. This
work advances scalable HAB monitoring in label-scarce environments while
enabling exploratory analysis via hierarchical embeddings: a critical step
toward operationalizing self-supervised learning for global aquatic
biogeochemistry.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了生物神经网络是否使用类似梯度下降的学习策略，发现非梯度的"旋度"成分在学习动态中可能有效优化损失函数，特别是在具有抑制-兴奋连接或Hebbian/反Hebbian可塑性的网络中。


<details>

Motivation: 研究生物神经网络是否使用梯度下降策略，以及多样化的突触可塑性规则是否近似梯度下降，探索非梯度学习动态的可能性。

Method: 在前馈网络中采用可分析处理的学生-教师框架，通过规则翻转可塑性的神经元系统引入非梯度动态，分析旋度项的影响。

Result: 小旋度项保持原始解流形的稳定性，学习动态类似梯度下降；超过临界值后强旋度项破坏稳定性，可能导致混沌学习动态或通过暂时上升损失来加速学习。

Conclusion: 特定架构能够通过多样化学习规则支持稳健学习，为神经网络中基于梯度学习的规范性理论提供了重要对比观点。

Abstract: Gradient-based algorithms are a cornerstone of artificial neural network
training, yet it remains unclear whether biological neural networks use similar
gradient-based strategies during learning. Experiments often discover a
diversity of synaptic plasticity rules, but whether these amount to an
approximation to gradient descent is unclear. Here we investigate a previously
overlooked possibility: that learning dynamics may include fundamentally
non-gradient "curl"-like components while still being able to effectively
optimize a loss function. Curl terms naturally emerge in networks with
inhibitory-excitatory connectivity or Hebbian/anti-Hebbian plasticity,
resulting in learning dynamics that cannot be framed as gradient descent on any
objective. To investigate the impact of these curl terms, we analyze
feedforward networks within an analytically tractable student-teacher
framework, systematically introducing non-gradient dynamics through neurons
exhibiting rule-flipped plasticity. Small curl terms preserve the stability of
the original solution manifold, resulting in learning dynamics similar to
gradient descent. Beyond a critical value, strong curl terms destabilize the
solution manifold. Depending on the network architecture, this loss of
stability can lead to chaotic learning dynamics that destroy performance. In
other cases, the curl terms can counterintuitively speed learning compared to
gradient descent by allowing the weight dynamics to escape saddles by
temporarily ascending the loss. Our results identify specific architectures
capable of supporting robust learning via diverse learning rules, providing an
important counterpoint to normative theories of gradient-based learning in
neural networks.

Method: 使用模型消融技术移除拒绝敏感方向，在SmolLM2-1.7B的安全预训练检查点上进行控制评估，对20个系统（原始和消融后）发出100个提示，使用多个评估者分类响应为拒绝或非拒绝。

Conclusion: 研究为将推理时编辑整合到安全评估中提供了一个实用协议，并确定了在消融下保持稳健的安全组件。

Abstract: Open-weight LLMs can be modified at inference time with simple activation
edits, which raises a practical question for safety: do common safety
interventions like refusal training or metatag training survive such edits? We
study model abliteration, a lightweight projection technique designed to remove
refusal-sensitive directions, and conduct a controlled evaluation across a
granular sequence of Safety Pretraining checkpoints for SmolLM2-1.7B, alongside
widely used open baselines. For each of 20 systems, original and abliterated,
we issue 100 prompts with balanced harmful and harmless cases, classify
responses as **Refusal** or **Non-Refusal** using multiple judges, and validate
judge fidelity on a small human-labeled subset. We also probe whether models
can identify refusal in their own outputs. Our study produces a
checkpoint-level characterization of which data-centric safety components
remain robust under abliteration, quantifies how judge selection influences
evaluation outcomes, and outlines a practical protocol for integrating
inference-time edits into safety assessments. Code:

TL;DR: 本文证明了深度ReLU网络在梯度下降训练下可实现最优泛化率，仅对网络深度有多项式依赖，而非指数依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究要么只能达到次优的O(1/√n)泛化率，要么需要平滑激活函数且对网络深度有指数依赖。本文旨在解决这一局限，为深度ReLU网络建立最优泛化率。

Method: 通过精心平衡优化误差和泛化误差，在数据满足NTK可分性假设下，采用新颖的技术控制参考模型附近的激活模式，从而获得更尖锐的Rademacher复杂度界限。

Result: 证明了梯度下降在深度ReLU网络中的超额风险率为~O(L⁴(1+γL²)/(nγ²))，与最优SVM型率~O(1/(nγ²))仅相差深度相关因子。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次为深度ReLU网络的梯度下降训练建立了最优泛化率，仅对网络深度有多项式依赖，是深度学习理论分析的重要进展。

Abstract: Recent advances have significantly improved our understanding of the
generalization performance of gradient descent (GD) methods in deep neural
networks. A natural and fundamental question is whether GD can achieve
generalization rates comparable to the minimax optimal rates established in the
kernel setting. Existing results either yield suboptimal rates of
$O(1/\sqrt{n})$, or focus on networks with smooth activation functions,
incurring exponential dependence on network depth $L$. In this work, we
establish optimal generalization rates for GD with deep ReLU networks by
carefully trading off optimization and generalization errors, achieving only
polynomial dependence on depth. Specifically, under the assumption that the
data are NTK separable from the margin $\gamma$, we prove an excess risk rate
of $\widetilde{O}(L^4 (1 + \gamma L^2) / (n \gamma^2))$, which aligns with the
optimal SVM-type rate $\widetilde{O}(1 / (n \gamma^2))$ up to depth-dependent
factors. A key technical contribution is our novel control of activation
patterns near a reference model, enabling a sharper Rademacher complexity bound
for deep ReLU networks trained with gradient descent.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的在线共形预测方法，通过用更广泛的函数类别替代二元评估来量化预测区间的相关性，从而产生更窄的预测区间同时保持覆盖有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有在线共形预测方法在阈值更新时仅关注预测区间的有效性（真值是否在区间内），而忽略了区间的相关性。本文旨在利用这一被忽视的方面来改进方法。

Method: 提出在阈值更新步骤中，用能够使用真值量化预测区间相关性的更广泛函数类别替代二元评估（在区间内/外），这有助于防止阈值突变。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的实验结果表明，这些函数能够产生比现有OCP方法更紧的区间，同时保持覆盖有效性。

Conclusion: 通过考虑预测区间的相关性而不仅仅是有效性，可以改进在线共形预测方法，产生更窄的预测区间而不牺牲覆盖保证。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification has received considerable interest in recent works
in Machine Learning. In particular, Conformal Prediction (CP) gains ground in
this field. For the case of time series, Online Conformal Prediction (OCP)
becomes an option to address the problem of data distribution shift over time.
Indeed, the idea of OCP is to update a threshold of some quantity (whether the
miscoverage level or the quantile) based on the distribution observation. To
evaluate the performance of OCP methods, two key aspects are typically
considered: the coverage validity and the prediction interval width
minimization. Recently, new OCP methods have emerged, offering long-run
coverage guarantees and producing more informative intervals. However, during
the threshold update step, most of these methods focus solely on the validity
of the prediction intervals~--~that is, whether the ground truth falls inside
or outside the interval~--~without accounting for their relevance. In this
paper, we aim to leverage this overlooked aspect. Specifically, we propose
enhancing the threshold update step by replacing the binary evaluation
(inside/outside) with a broader class of functions that quantify the relevance
of the prediction interval using the ground truth. This approach helps prevent
abrupt threshold changes, potentially resulting in narrower prediction
intervals. Indeed, experimental results on real-world datasets suggest that
these functions can produce tighter intervals compared to existing OCP methods
while maintaining coverage validity.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督学习方法容易受到虚假相关性的影响，特别是在测试数据分布偏移时。现有方法如Group DRO虽然对组间偏移具有鲁棒性，但对组内分布偏移仍然脆弱，这在样本有限的少数群体中尤为常见。

Method: 提出分层扩展的Group DRO方法，同时处理组间和组内不确定性，提供多层次的分布偏移鲁棒性。还引入了模拟现实少数群体分布偏移的新基准设置。

Result: 该方法在现有鲁棒学习方法持续失败的新基准条件下表现出强大的鲁棒性，同时在标准基准测试中也取得了优越性能。

Conclusion: 结果表明，扩大模糊集以更好地捕捉组间和组内分布不确定性非常重要，这为解决虚假相关性研究中的重要挑战提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Conventional supervised learning methods are often vulnerable to spurious
correlations, particularly under distribution shifts in test data. To address
this issue, several approaches, most notably Group DRO, have been developed.
While these methods are highly robust to subpopulation or group shifts, they
remain vulnerable to intra-group distributional shifts, which frequently occur
in minority groups with limited samples. We propose a hierarchical extension of
Group DRO that addresses both inter-group and intra-group uncertainties,
providing robustness to distribution shifts at multiple levels. We also
introduce new benchmark settings that simulate realistic minority group
distribution shifts-an important yet previously underexplored challenge in
spurious correlation research. Our method demonstrates strong robustness under
these conditions-where existing robust learning methods consistently fail-while
also achieving superior performance on standard benchmarks. These results
highlight the importance of broadening the ambiguity set to better capture both
inter-group and intra-group distributional uncertainties.

Conclusion: 该工作提供了随机顺序模型与一般对抗模型之间的进一步分离，并为将随机算法适应到随机顺序设置提供了通用框架。

Abstract: In the random-order model for online learning,
  the sequence of losses is chosen upfront by an adversary and presented to the
learner
  after a random permutation. Any random-order input is \emph{asymptotically}
equivalent to a stochastic i.i.d. one, but, for finite times, it may exhibit
significant {\em non-stationarity}, which can hinder the performance of
stochastic learning algorithms.
  While algorithms for adversarial inputs naturally maintain their regret
guarantees in random order, simple no-regret algorithms exist for the
stochastic model that fail against random-order instances.
  In this paper, we propose a general template to adapt stochastic learning
algorithms to the random-order model without substantially affecting their
regret guarantees. This allows us to recover improved regret bounds for
prediction with delays, online learning with constraints, and bandits with
switching costs. Finally, we investigate online classification and prove that,
in random order, learnability is characterized by the VC dimension rather than
the Littlestone dimension, thus providing a further separation from the general
adversarial model.

Conclusion: FlexiQ在NPU和GPU上引入最小运行时开销，证明了其硬件效率和整体性能优势，能够有效处理波动推理工作负载。

Abstract: Neural networks commonly execute on hardware accelerators such as NPUs and
GPUs for their size and computation overhead. These accelerators are costly and
it is hard to scale their resources to handle real-time workload fluctuations.
  We present FlexiQ, an adaptive mixed-precision quantization scheme for
computer vision models. FlexiQ selectively applies low-bitwidth computation to
feature channels with small value ranges and employs an efficient bit-lowering
method to minimize quantization errors while maintaining inference accuracy.
Furthermore, FlexiQ adjusts its low-bitwidth channel ratio in real time,
enabling quantized models to effectively manage fluctuating inference workload.
  We implemented FlexiQ prototype, including the mixed-precision inference
runtime on our custom NPU and GPUs. Evaluated on eleven convolution- and
transformer-based vision models, FlexiQ achieves on average 6.6% higher
accuracy for 4-bit models with finetuning and outperforms four state-of-the-art

efficient accuracy-latency trade-off, with the 50% 4-bit model incurring only
0.6% accuracy loss while achieving 40% of the speedup of the 100% 4-bit model
over 8-bit model. Latency evaluations on our NPU and GPUs confirmed that FlexiQ

Motivation: 状态空间模型在处理长序列任务时面临表达能力和计算负担的平衡问题，需要找到既能最大化表达能力又能限制计算成本的方法。

Method: 利用控制理论中的Hankel奇异值分析，在训练过程中识别高能量状态维度并进行平衡截断，适用于线性时不变SSM和选择性模型。

Result: 实验表明训练中降维显著加速优化过程，压缩模型保留了任务关键结构，性能优于直接训练的小维度模型。

Conclusion: 从大模型开始并在训练过程中缩小的SSM能够实现计算效率的同时保持更高性能。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs), developed to tackle long sequence modeling tasks
efficiently, offer both parallelizable training and fast inference. At their
core are recurrent dynamical systems that maintain a hidden state, with update
costs scaling with the state dimension. A key design challenge is striking the
right balance between maximizing expressivity and limiting this computational
burden. Control theory, and more specifically Hankel singular value analysis,
provides a potent framework for the measure of energy for each state, as well
as the balanced truncation of the original system down to a smaller
representation with performance guarantees. Leveraging the eigenvalue stability
properties of Hankel matrices, we apply this lens to SSMs during training,
where only dimensions of high influence are identified and preserved. Our
approach applies to Linear Time-Invariant SSMs such as Linear Recurrent Units,
but is also extendable to selective models. Experiments show that in-training
reduction significantly accelerates optimization while preserving expressivity,
with compressed models retaining task-critical structure lost by models trained
directly at smaller dimension. In other words, SSMs that begin large and shrink
during training achieve computational efficiency while maintaining higher
performance.

Conclusion: 迭代精炼框架为理解VAR提供了新视角，揭示了其成功的关键因素，并展示了在保持少步、尺度并行生成的同时与扩散工具生态集成的潜力。

Abstract: We revisit Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models through the lens of an
iterative-refinement framework. Rather than viewing VAR solely as next-scale
autoregression, we formalise it as a deterministic forward process that
constructs a Laplacian-style latent pyramid, paired with a learned backward
process that reconstructs it in a small number of coarse-to-fine steps. This
view connects VAR to denoising diffusion and isolates three design choices that
help explain its efficiency and fidelity: refining in a learned latent space,
casting prediction as discrete classification over code indices, and
partitioning the task by spatial frequency. We run controlled experiments to
quantify each factor's contribution to fidelity and speed, and we outline how
the same framework extends to permutation-invariant graph generation and to
probabilistic, ensemble-style medium-range weather forecasting. The framework
also suggests practical interfaces for VAR to leverage tools from the diffusion
ecosystem while retaining few-step, scale-parallel generation.

Result: 在CH-2025数据集（10个受试者的450个日观测）上评估，SASL-LightGBM混合框架达到与黑盒方法相当的预测性能，但参数更少、透明度更高。

Conclusion: SASL框架在保持可解释性的同时实现了与复杂黑盒方法相当的预测准确性，为临床实践提供了清晰可行的见解。

Abstract: Improved prediction of personalized health outcomes -- such as sleep quality
and stress -- from multimodal lifelog data could have meaningful clinical and
practical implications. However, state-of-the-art models, primarily deep neural
networks and gradient-boosted ensembles, sacrifice interpretability and fail to
adequately address the significant inter-individual variability inherent in
lifelog data. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Subject-Adaptive
Sparse Linear (SASL) framework, an interpretable modeling approach explicitly
designed for personalized health prediction. SASL integrates ordinary least
squares regression with subject-specific interactions, systematically
distinguishing global from individual-level effects. We employ an iterative
backward feature elimination method based on nested $F$-tests to construct a
sparse and statistically robust model. Additionally, recognizing that health
outcomes often represent discretized versions of continuous processes, we
develop a regression-then-thresholding approach specifically designed to
maximize macro-averaged F1 scores for ordinal targets. For intrinsically
challenging predictions, SASL selectively incorporates outputs from compact
LightGBM models through confidence-based gating, enhancing accuracy without
compromising interpretability. Evaluations conducted on the CH-2025 dataset --
which comprises roughly 450 daily observations from ten subjects -- demonstrate
that the hybrid SASL-LightGBM framework achieves predictive performance
comparable to that of sophisticated black-box methods, but with significantly
fewer parameters and substantially greater transparency, thus providing clear
and actionable insights for clinicians and practitioners.

TL;DR: 提出Karma模型，一种知识感知的频率自适应学习方法，用于电池容量估计和剩余使用寿命预测，通过双流深度学习架构结合物理知识指导，显著提升预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有数据驱动模型在电池健康预测中缺乏知识指导、长期预测不可靠的问题，应对电池退化行为的复杂性（非线性、噪声、容量再生等）。

Method: 采用信号分解获得不同频段的电池信号，构建双流深度学习架构：一个流捕捉长期低频退化趋势，另一个流建模高频短期动态。使用双指数函数建模电池退化知识，通过粒子滤波器优化知识参数。

Result: 在两个主流数据集上，Karma模型相比最先进算法分别实现了50.6%和32.6%的平均误差降低，表现出优越的性能。

Conclusion: Karma模型具有鲁棒性、泛化能力强，能够为各种应用提供更安全可靠的电池管理解决方案。

Abstract: Battery health prognostics are critical for ensuring safety, efficiency, and
sustainability in modern energy systems. However, it has been challenging to
achieve accurate and robust prognostics due to complex battery degradation
behaviors with nonlinearity, noise, capacity regeneration, etc. Existing
data-driven models capture temporal degradation features but often lack
knowledge guidance, which leads to unreliable long-term health prognostics. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Karma, a knowledge-aware model with
frequency-adaptive learning for battery capacity estimation and remaining
useful life prediction. The model first performs signal decomposition to derive
battery signals in different frequency bands. A dual-stream deep learning
architecture is developed, where one stream captures long-term low-frequency
degradation trends and the other models high-frequency short-term dynamics.
Karma regulates the prognostics with knowledge, where battery degradation is
modeled as a double exponential function based on empirical studies. Our
dual-stream model is used to optimize the parameters of the knowledge with
particle filters to ensure physically consistent and reliable prognostics and
uncertainty quantification. Experimental study demonstrates Karma's superior
performance, achieving average error reductions of 50.6% and 32.6% over
state-of-the-art algorithms for battery health prediction on two mainstream
datasets, respectively. These results highlight Karma's robustness,
generalizability, and potential for safer and more reliable battery management
across diverse applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RoiRL是一种轻量级的离线强化学习方法，通过优化加权对数似然目标替代在线RL，无需参考模型，显著降低计算成本，在推理任务上比TTRL训练快2.5倍且性能更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习需要真实奖励信号，而测试时强化学习(TTRL)虽使用多数投票奖励但依赖高成本的在线RL，计算开销大。

Method: 提出RoiRL：基于离线迭代强化学习的推理方法，优化加权对数似然目标，无需维护参考模型，实现稳定训练。

Result: 实验显示RoiRL训练速度比TTRL快2.5倍，在推理基准测试中表现更优。

Conclusion: RoiRL为无标签的自改进大语言模型提供了可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is central to improving reasoning in large
language models (LLMs) but typically requires ground-truth rewards. Test-Time
Reinforcement Learning (TTRL) removes this need by using majority-vote rewards,
but relies on heavy online RL and incurs substantial computational cost. We
propose RoiRL: Reasoning with offline iterative Reinforcement Learning, a
family of lightweight offline learning alternatives that can target the same
regularized optimal policies. Unlike TTRL, RoiRL eliminates the need to
maintain a reference model and instead optimizes weighted log-likelihood
objectives, enabling stable training with significantly lower memory and
compute requirements. Experimental results show that RoiRL trains to 2.5x
faster and consistently outperforms TTRL on reasoning benchmarks, establishing
a scalable path to self-improving LLMs without labels.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DMark是首个专门为扩散大语言模型设计的水印框架，通过预测性水印、双向水印及其组合策略，解决了传统水印方法在非自回归模型上的失效问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型相比自回归模型生成速度更快且质量相当，但现有水印方法因其非顺序解码特性而失效，需要专门设计适用于非自回归模型的水印方案。

Method: 提出三种互补策略：预测性水印（在缺乏实际上下文时使用模型预测的token）、双向水印（利用扩散解码特有的前后向依赖关系）、预测-双向水印（结合两者最大化检测强度）。

Result: 在多个dLLM上的实验显示，DMark在1%误报率下达到92.0-99.5%的检测率，且保持文本质量，而现有方法仅能达到49.6-71.2%。

Conclusion: DMark证明了在非自回归语言模型中实现有效水印是可行的，并对文本操作具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer faster generation than
autoregressive models while maintaining comparable quality, but existing
watermarking methods fail on them due to their non-sequential decoding. Unlike
autoregressive models that generate tokens left-to-right, dLLMs can finalize
tokens in arbitrary order, breaking the causal design underlying traditional
watermarks. We present DMark, the first watermarking framework designed
specifically for dLLMs. DMark introduces three complementary strategies to
restore watermark detectability: predictive watermarking uses model-predicted
tokens when actual context is unavailable; bidirectional watermarking exploits
both forward and backward dependencies unique to diffusion decoding; and
predictive-bidirectional watermarking combines both approaches to maximize
detection strength. Experiments across multiple dLLMs show that DMark achieves
92.0-99.5% detection rates at 1% false positive rate while maintaining text
quality, compared to only 49.6-71.2% for naive adaptations of existing methods.
DMark also demonstrates robustness against text manipulations, establishing
that effective watermarking is feasible for non-autoregressive language models.

Conclusion: Cell-MNN是一个有前景的方法，能够有效模拟细胞分化动态，同时提供生物学可解释的基因相互作用。

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of cellular differentiation is fundamental to advancing
the understanding and treatment of diseases associated with this process, such
as cancer. With the rapid growth of single-cell datasets, this has also become
a particularly promising and active domain for machine learning. Current
state-of-the-art models, however, rely on computationally expensive optimal
transport preprocessing and multi-stage training, while also not discovering
explicit gene interactions. To address these challenges we propose
Cell-Mechanistic Neural Networks (Cell-MNN), an encoder-decoder architecture
whose latent representation is a locally linearized ODE governing the dynamics
of cellular evolution from stem to tissue cells. Cell-MNN is fully end-to-end
(besides a standard PCA pre-processing) and its ODE representation explicitly
learns biologically consistent and interpretable gene interactions.
Empirically, we show that Cell-MNN achieves competitive performance on
single-cell benchmarks, surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in scaling to
larger datasets and joint training across multiple datasets, while also
learning interpretable gene interactions that we validate against the TRRUST
database of gene interactions.

Method: 结合多类AdaBoost算法的权重机制进行自适应梯度聚合，为本地错误率较低的客户端分配更高权重；同时动态调整焦点损失参数来提升表现不佳客户端的训练。

Result: 在MNIST、FEMNIST和CIFAR10三个基准数据集上的实验表明，FeDABoost相比FedAvg和Ditto方法，实现了更好的公平性和有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: FeDABoost框架通过集成动态提升和自适应聚合策略，有效提升了联邦学习在非IID设置下的公平性和性能表现。

Abstract: This work focuses on improving the performance and fairness of Federated
Learning (FL) in non IID settings by enhancing model aggregation and boosting
the training of underperforming clients. We propose FeDABoost, a novel FL
framework that integrates a dynamic boosting mechanism and an adaptive gradient
aggregation strategy. Inspired by the weighting mechanism of the Multiclass
AdaBoost (SAMME) algorithm, our aggregation method assigns higher weights to
clients with lower local error rates, thereby promoting more reliable
contributions to the global model. In parallel, FeDABoost dynamically boosts
underperforming clients by adjusting the focal loss focusing parameter,
emphasizing hard to classify examples during local training. We have evaluated
FeDABoost on three benchmark datasets MNIST, FEMNIST, and CIFAR10, and compared
its performance with those of FedAvg and Ditto. The results show that FeDABoost
achieves improved fairness and competitive performance.

Result: 在四个医疗中心收集的iEEG记录上评估，实现了有竞争力的分类性能，并为从业者提供了更高的透明度和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在临床变长时间序列分类中实现可靠和可解释分类的潜力。

Abstract: Medical time series analysis is challenging due to data sparsity, noise, and
highly variable recording lengths. Prior work has shown that stochastic sparse
sampling effectively handles variable-length signals, while retrieval-augmented
approaches improve explainability and robustness to noise and weak temporal
correlations. In this study, we generalize the stochastic sparse sampling
framework for retrieval-informed classification. Specifically, we weight window
predictions by within-channel similarity and aggregate them in probability
space, yielding convex series-level scores and an explicit evidence trail for
explainability. Our method achieves competitive iEEG classification performance
and provides practitioners with greater transparency and explainability. We
evaluate our method in iEEG recordings collected in four medical centers,
demonstrating its potential for reliable and explainable clinical
variable-length time series classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统持续强化学习主要关注风险中性决策，而现实应用中需要考虑超越期望值的长期性能度量，因此需要建立风险感知的持续强化学习理论框架。

Method: 作者首先证明经典风险度量理论与持续设置不兼容，然后引入新的遍历风险度量类别来扩展风险度量理论，使其适用于持续学习环境。

Result: 通过案例研究和实证结果验证了遍历风险度量的直观吸引力和理论合理性，展示了其在风险感知持续学习中的有效性。

Conclusion: 遍历风险度量为风险感知的持续强化学习提供了理论基础，解决了经典风险度量理论与持续设置不兼容的问题，为开发能够平衡信息保留和新情境适应的RL智能体提供了新方向。

Abstract: Continual reinforcement learning (continual RL) seeks to formalize the
notions of lifelong learning and endless adaptation in RL. In particular, the
aim of continual RL is to develop RL agents that can maintain a careful balance
between retaining useful information and adapting to new situations. To date,
continual RL has been explored almost exclusively through the lens of
risk-neutral decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize the expected
(or mean) long-run performance. In this work, we present the first formal
theoretical treatment of continual RL through the lens of risk-aware
decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize a reward-based measure of
long-run performance beyond the mean. In particular, we show that the classical
theory of risk measures, widely used as a theoretical foundation in
non-continual risk-aware RL, is, in its current form, incompatible with the
continual setting. Then, building on this insight, we extend risk measure
theory into the continual setting by introducing a new class of ergodic risk
measures that are compatible with continual learning. Finally, we provide a
case study of risk-aware continual learning, along with empirical results,
which show the intuitive appeal and theoretical soundness of ergodic risk
measures.

Abstract: Inferring trajectories from longitudinal spatially-resolved omics data is
fundamental to understanding the dynamics of structural and functional tissue
changes in development, regeneration and repair, disease progression, and
response to treatment. We propose ContextFlow, a novel context-aware flow
matching framework that incorporates prior knowledge to guide the inference of
structural tissue dynamics from spatially resolved omics data. Specifically,
ContextFlow integrates local tissue organization and ligand-receptor
communication patterns into a transition plausibility matrix that regularizes
the optimal transport objective. By embedding these contextual constraints,
ContextFlow generates trajectories that are not only statistically consistent
but also biologically meaningful, making it a generalizable framework for
modeling spatiotemporal dynamics from longitudinal, spatially resolved omics
data. Evaluated on three datasets, ContextFlow consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art flow matching methods across multiple quantitative and
qualitative metrics of inference accuracy and biological coherence. Our code is

Abstract: Assessing model generalization under distribution shift is essential for
real-world deployment, particularly when labeled test data is unavailable. This
paper presents a unified and practical framework for unsupervised model
evaluation and ranking in two common deployment settings: (1) estimating the
accuracy of a fixed model on multiple unlabeled test sets (dataset-centric
evaluation), and (2) ranking a set of candidate models on a single unlabeled
test set (model-centric evaluation). We demonstrate that two intrinsic
properties of model predictions, namely confidence (which reflects prediction
certainty) and dispersity (which captures the diversity of predicted classes),
together provide strong and complementary signals for generalization. We
systematically benchmark a set of confidence-based, dispersity-based, and
hybrid metrics across a wide range of model architectures, datasets, and
distribution shift types. Our results show that hybrid metrics consistently
outperform single-aspect metrics on both dataset-centric and model-centric
evaluation settings. In particular, the nuclear norm of the prediction matrix
provides robust and accurate performance across tasks, including real-world
datasets, and maintains reliability under moderate class imbalance. These
findings offer a practical and generalizable basis for unsupervised model
assessment in deployment scenarios.

Abstract: With the growth of global maritime transportation, energy optimization has
become crucial for reducing costs and ensuring operational efficiency. Shaft
power is the mechanical power transmitted from the engine to the shaft and
directly impacts fuel consumption, making its accurate prediction a paramount
step in optimizing vessel performance. Power consumption is highly correlated
with ship parameters such as speed and shaft rotation per minute, as well as
weather and sea conditions. Frequent access to this operational data can
improve prediction accuracy. However, obtaining high-quality sensor data is
often infeasible and costly, making alternative sources such as noon reports a
viable option. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning-based approach for
predicting vessels shaft power, where a model is initially trained on
high-frequency data from a vessel and then fine-tuned with low-frequency daily
noon reports from other vessels. We tested our approach on sister vessels
(identical dimensions and configurations), a similar vessel (slightly larger
with a different engine), and a different vessel (distinct dimensions and
configurations). The experiments showed that the mean absolute percentage error
decreased by 10.6 percent for sister vessels, 3.6 percent for a similar vessel,
and 5.3 percent for a different vessel, compared to the model trained solely on
noon report data.

Abstract: The development of diagnostic models is gaining traction in the field of
psychiatric disorders. Recently, machine learning classifiers based on
resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) have been
developed to identify brain biomarkers that differentiate psychiatric disorders
from healthy controls. However, conventional machine learning-based diagnostic
models often depend on extensive feature engineering, which introduces bias
through manual intervention. While deep learning models are expected to operate
without manual involvement, their lack of interpretability poses significant
challenges in obtaining explainable and reliable brain biomarkers to support
diagnostic decisions, ultimately limiting their clinical applicability. In this
study, we introduce an end-to-end innovative graph neural network framework
named BrainIB++, which applies the information bottleneck (IB) principle to
identify the most informative data-driven brain regions as subgraphs during
model training for interpretation. We evaluate the performance of our model
against nine established brain network classification methods across three
multi-cohort schizophrenia datasets. It consistently demonstrates superior
diagnostic accuracy and exhibits generalizability to unseen data. Furthermore,
the subgraphs identified by our model also correspond with established clinical
biomarkers in schizophrenia, particularly emphasizing abnormalities in the
visual, sensorimotor, and higher cognition brain functional network. This
alignment enhances the model's interpretability and underscores its relevance
for real-world diagnostic applications.

Conclusion: 该分布框架适用于行为分析和风险感知模仿学习，能够有效捕捉专家行为的丰富结构特征。

Abstract: We propose a distributional framework for offline Inverse Reinforcement
Learning (IRL) that jointly models uncertainty over reward functions and full
distributions of returns. Unlike conventional IRL approaches that recover a
deterministic reward estimate or match only expected returns, our method
captures richer structure in expert behavior, particularly in learning the
reward distribution, by minimizing first-order stochastic dominance (FSD)
violations and thus integrating distortion risk measures (DRMs) into policy
learning, enabling the recovery of both reward distributions and
distribution-aware policies. This formulation is well-suited for behavior
analysis and risk-aware imitation learning. Empirical results on synthetic
benchmarks, real-world neurobehavioral data, and MuJoCo control tasks
demonstrate that our method recovers expressive reward representations and
achieves state-of-the-art imitation performance.

Conclusion: DMIS是扩散模型中首个系统研究不精确监督问题的框架，能有效处理各种形式的不精确标签，提升生成质量。

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in various
generative tasks recently, but their training typically relies on large-scale
datasets that inevitably contain imprecise information in conditional inputs.
Such supervision, often stemming from noisy, ambiguous, or incomplete labels,
will cause condition mismatch and degrade generation quality. To address this
challenge, we propose DMIS, a unified framework for training robust Diffusion
Models from Imprecise Supervision, which is the first systematic study within
diffusion models. Our framework is derived from likelihood maximization and
decomposes the objective into generative and classification components: the
generative component models imprecise-label distributions, while the
classification component leverages a diffusion classifier to infer
class-posterior probabilities, with its efficiency further improved by an
optimized timestep sampling strategy. Extensive experiments on diverse forms of
imprecise supervision, covering tasks of image generation, weakly supervised
learning, and noisy dataset condensation demonstrate that DMIS consistently
produces high-quality and class-discriminative samples.

Abstract: Samples of brain signals collected by EEG sensors have inherent
anti-correlations that are well modeled by negative edges in a finite graph. To
differentiate epilepsy patients from healthy subjects using collected EEG
signals, we build lightweight and interpretable transformer-like neural nets by
unrolling a spectral denoising algorithm for signals on a balanced signed graph
-- graph with no cycles of odd number of negative edges. A balanced signed
graph has well-defined frequencies that map to a corresponding positive graph
via similarity transform of the graph Laplacian matrices. We implement an ideal
low-pass filter efficiently on the mapped positive graph via Lanczos
approximation, where the optimal cutoff frequency is learned from data. Given
that two balanced signed graph denoisers learn posterior probabilities of two
different signal classes during training, we evaluate their reconstruction
errors for binary classification of EEG signals. Experiments show that our
method achieves classification performance comparable to representative deep
learning schemes, while employing dramatically fewer parameters.

Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLPs) have become essential for large-scale
atomistic simulations, enabling ab initio-level accuracy with computational
efficiency. However, current MLPs struggle with uncertainty quantification,
limiting their reliability for active learning, calibration, and
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. We address these challenges by developing
Bayesian E(3) equivariant MLPs with iterative restratification of many-body
message passing. Our approach introduces the joint energy-force negative
log-likelihood (NLL$_\text{JEF}$) loss function, which explicitly models
uncertainty in both energies and interatomic forces, yielding superior accuracy
compared to conventional NLL losses. We systematically benchmark multiple
Bayesian approaches, including deep ensembles with mean-variance estimation,
stochastic weight averaging Gaussian, improved variational online Newton, and
laplace approximation by evaluating their performance on uncertainty
prediction, OOD detection, calibration, and active learning tasks. We further
demonstrate that NLL$_\text{JEF}$ facilitates efficient active learning by
quantifying energy and force uncertainties. Using Bayesian active learning by
disagreement (BALD), our framework outperforms random sampling and
energy-uncertainty-based sampling. Our results demonstrate that Bayesian MLPs
achieve competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art models while enabling
uncertainty-guided active learning, OOD detection, and energy/forces
calibration. This work establishes Bayesian equivariant neural networks as a
powerful framework for developing uncertainty-aware MLPs for atomistic
simulations at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝叶斯优化(BO)的性能依赖于需要手动调整的超参数，这些参数在不同问题场景中难以泛化。需要一种更通用、无需调参的优化方法。

Method: 使用12种BO变体收集大规模优化轨迹，通过离线强化学习在数百万个合成的基于高斯过程的多样化函数上进行预训练。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个可重用的优化基础，为未来扩展和改进奠定了基础，展示了预训练模型在黑盒优化中的潜力。

Abstract: Global optimization of expensive, derivative-free black-box functions
requires extreme sample efficiency. While Bayesian optimization (BO) is the
current state-of-the-art, its performance hinges on surrogate and acquisition
function hyper-parameters that are often hand-tuned and fail to generalize
across problem landscapes. We present ZeroShotOpt, a general-purpose,
pretrained model for continuous black-box optimization tasks ranging from 2D to
20D. Our approach leverages offline reinforcement learning on large-scale
optimization trajectories collected from 12 BO variants. To scale pretraining,
we generate millions of synthetic Gaussian process-based functions with diverse
landscapes, enabling the model to learn transferable optimization policies. As
a result, ZeroShotOpt achieves robust zero-shot generalization on a wide array
of unseen benchmarks, matching or surpassing the sample efficiency of leading
global optimizers, including BO, while also offering a reusable foundation for
future extensions and improvements. Our open-source code, dataset, and model

Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of Soft Actor Critic (SAC), Greedy Actor
Critic (GAC), and Truncated Quantile Critics (TQC) in high-dimensional
decision-making tasks using fully observable environments. The focus is on
parametrized action (PA) spaces, eliminating the need for recurrent networks,
with benchmarks Platform-v0 and Goal-v0 testing discrete actions linked to
continuous action-parameter spaces. Hyperparameter optimization was performed
with Microsoft NNI, ensuring reproducibility by modifying the codebase for GAC

outperformed other algorithms, achieving the fastest training times and highest
returns across benchmarks, completing 5,000 episodes in 41:24 for the Platform

clear advantages in complex action spaces. Compared to PASAC and PATQC, PAGAC
demonstrated superior efficiency and reliability, making it ideal for tasks
requiring rapid convergence and robust performance. Future work could explore
hybrid strategies combining entropy-regularization with truncation-based
methods to enhance stability and expand investigations into generalizability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度强化学习在解决旅行商问题方面取得了进展，但对于接近旅行商问题关注较少，主要挑战在于其基于邻域的访问标准。

Method: 使用离散化方案制定马尔可夫决策过程，提出UD3RL框架，包含节点解码器和位置解码器分别处理两个子任务，采用k近邻子图交互策略增强空间推理，定制REINFORCE算法进行训练。

Result: UD3RL在解质量和运行时间上优于传统方法，在不同问题规模、空间分布和半径范围上表现出强泛化能力，对动态环境具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: UD3RL是一个有效的统一框架，能够解决接近旅行商问题并在多个维度上表现出优异的性能。

Abstract: In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has gained traction for
solving the NP-hard traveling salesman problem (TSP). However, limited
attention has been given to the close-enough TSP (CETSP), primarily due to the
challenge introduced by its neighborhood-based visitation criterion, wherein a
node is considered visited if the agent enters a compact neighborhood around
it. In this work, we formulate a Markov decision process (MDP) for CETSP using
a discretization scheme and propose a novel unified dual-decoder DRL (UD3RL)
framework that separates decision-making into node selection and waypoint
determination. Specifically, an adapted encoder is employed for effective
feature extraction, followed by a node-decoder and a loc-decoder to handle the
two sub-tasks, respectively. A k-nearest neighbors subgraph interaction
strategy is further introduced to enhance spatial reasoning during location
decoding. Furthermore, we customize the REINFORCE algorithm to train UD3RL as a
unified model capable of generalizing across different problem sizes and
varying neighborhood radius types (i.e., constant and random radii).
Experimental results show that UD3RL outperforms conventional methods in both
solution quality and runtime, while exhibiting strong generalization across
problem scales, spatial distributions, and radius ranges, as well as robustness
to dynamic environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于图对齐问题的链式GNN方法，通过训练一系列GNN网络迭代优化相似度矩阵，结合节点对架构捕捉全局结构模式，显著提升了图对齐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN在图组合优化问题上难以超越传统优化方法，限制了其实际应用。图对齐作为NP难问题，需要更有效的方法来寻找无标签图间的节点对应关系。

Method: 训练链式GNN序列，每个网络学习迭代优化前一个网络产生的相似度矩阵；使用节点对架构而非单节点架构，捕捉全局结构模式；在推理时产生自举效应，结合离散排名信息改进对齐质量。

Result: 在合成基准测试中，链式GNN比现有方法准确率提升3倍以上；在正则图上唯一能成功解决，而所有竞争方法都失败；与传统优化方法结合后，在图对齐基准上显著优于最先进的求解器。

Conclusion: 链式GNN方法有效解决了图对齐问题，证明了GNN在组合优化任务中的潜力，为GNN在实际应用中的推广提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have struggled to outperform traditional
optimization methods on combinatorial problems, limiting their practical
impact. We address this gap by introducing a novel chaining procedure for the
graph alignment problem, a fundamental NP-hard task of finding optimal node
correspondences between unlabeled graphs using only structural information. Our
method trains a sequence of GNNs where each network learns to iteratively
refine similarity matrices produced by previous networks. During inference,
this creates a bootstrap effect: each GNN improves upon partial solutions by
incorporating discrete ranking information about node alignment quality from
prior iterations. We combine this with a powerful architecture that operates on
node pairs rather than individual nodes, capturing global structural patterns
essential for alignment that standard message-passing networks cannot
represent. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks demonstrate
substantial improvements: our chained GNNs achieve over 3x better accuracy than
existing methods on challenging instances, and uniquely solve regular graphs
where all competing approaches fail. When combined with traditional
optimization as post-processing, our method substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art solvers on the graph alignment benchmark.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于分数蒸馏的方法，显著减少了蛋白质骨架生成的采样步骤，在保持生成质量的同时实现20倍以上的速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散和流式生成模型在蛋白质骨架生成中表现出色，但采样过程需要数百次迭代步骤，计算成本高昂，限制了在大规模蛋白质发现中的实际应用。

Method: 采用分数身份蒸馏(SiD)技术，结合多步生成和推理时噪声调制，训练少步蛋白质骨架生成器。

Result: 蒸馏后的少步生成器实现了超过20倍的采样速度提升，同时保持了与原始Proteina教师模型相当的可设计性、多样性和新颖性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了推理成本，使基于扩散的模型更接近实际的蛋白质工程应用，实现了大规模计算机模拟蛋白质设计。

Abstract: Diffusion- and flow-based generative models have recently demonstrated strong
performance in protein backbone generation tasks, offering unprecedented
capabilities for de novo protein design. However, while achieving notable
performance in generation quality, these models are limited by their generating
speed, often requiring hundreds of iterative steps in the reverse-diffusion
process. This computational bottleneck limits their practical utility in
large-scale protein discovery, where thousands to millions of candidate
structures are needed. To address this challenge, we explore the techniques of
score distillation, which has shown great success in reducing the number of
sampling steps in the vision domain while maintaining high generation quality.
However, a straightforward adaptation of these methods results in unacceptably
low designability. Through extensive study, we have identified how to
appropriately adapt Score identity Distillation (SiD), a state-of-the-art score
distillation strategy, to train few-step protein backbone generators which
significantly reduce sampling time, while maintaining comparable performance to
their pretrained teacher model. In particular, multistep generation combined
with inference time noise modulation is key to the success. We demonstrate that
our distilled few-step generators achieve more than a 20-fold improvement in
sampling speed, while achieving similar levels of designability, diversity, and
novelty as the Proteina teacher model. This reduction in inference cost enables
large-scale in silico protein design, thereby bringing diffusion-based models
closer to real-world protein engineering applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图结构数据引入了复杂的依赖关系，传统的特征重要性度量方法可能不适用。需要一种能够衡量特征对模型输出贡献的方法，用于解释决策、降低维度，甚至通过消除无帮助变量来提高性能。

Method: 基于验证性能在特征值置换后的变化来确定相关特征。该方法与模型和任务无关，在训练过程中确定相关特征，并跟踪特征重要性随特征逐步丢弃的演变过程。

Result: 经验结果验证了该方法对不同图架构的灵活性，以及对更具挑战性的图学习设置的适应性。

Conclusion: 提出的干预式方法能够有效识别和移除不必要的节点特征，提高图神经网络的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: We propose an adaptive node feature selection approach for graph neural
networks (GNNs) that identifies and removes unnecessary features during
training. The ability to measure how features contribute to model output is key
for interpreting decisions, reducing dimensionality, and even improving
performance by eliminating unhelpful variables. However, graph-structured data
introduces complex dependencies that may not be amenable to classical feature
importance metrics. Inspired by this challenge, we present a model- and
task-agnostic method that determines relevant features during training based on
changes in validation performance upon permuting feature values. We
theoretically motivate our intervention-based approach by characterizing how
GNN performance depends on the relationships between node data and graph
structure. Not only do we return feature importance scores once training
concludes, we also track how relevance evolves as features are successively
dropped. We can therefore monitor if features are eliminated effectively and
also evaluate other metrics with this technique. Our empirical results verify
the flexibility of our approach to different graph architectures as well as its
adaptability to more challenging graph learning settings.

Motivation: 在边缘和移动设备上使用预训练神经网络时，需要高效适应用户特定的运行时数据分布，但受限于计算和内存资源。现有方法依赖标签数据、完整反向传播或服务器端元训练，不适合受限设备。

Method: AdaBet通过Betti数分析层激活空间的拓扑特征，仅使用前向传播来评估层的重要性，无需标签或梯度即可选择具有高学习容量的层。

Result: 在16对基准模型和数据集上的评估显示，AdaBet比基于梯度的基线平均分类准确率提高5%，同时平均峰值内存消耗减少40%。

Conclusion: AdaBet提供了一种高效、轻量级的层选择方法，能够在资源受限的设备上实现更好的神经网络适应性能。

Abstract: To utilize pre-trained neural networks on edge and mobile devices, we often
require efficient adaptation to user-specific runtime data distributions while
operating under limited compute and memory resources. On-device retraining with
a target dataset can facilitate such adaptations; however, it remains
impractical due to the increasing depth of modern neural nets, as well as the
computational overhead associated with gradient-based optimization across all
layers. Current approaches reduce training cost by selecting a subset of layers
for retraining, however, they rely on labeled data, at least one full-model
backpropagation, or server-side meta-training; limiting their suitability for
constrained devices. We introduce AdaBet, a gradient-free layer selection
approach to rank important layers by analyzing topological features of their
activation spaces through Betti Numbers and using forward passes alone. AdaBet
allows selecting layers with high learning capacity, which are important for
retraining and adaptation, without requiring labels or gradients. Evaluating
AdaBet on sixteen pairs of benchmark models and datasets, shows AdaBet achieves
an average gain of 5% more classification accuracy over gradient-based
baselines while reducing average peak memory consumption by 40%.

Abstract: Efficient real-time dispatching in urban metro systems is essential for
ensuring service reliability, maximizing resource utilization, and improving
passenger satisfaction. This study presents a novel deep learning framework
centered on a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) model designed to
predict the complex spatiotemporal propagation of train headways across an
entire metro line. By directly incorporating planned terminal headways as a
critical input alongside historical headway data, the proposed model accurately
forecasts future headway dynamics, effectively capturing both their temporal
evolution and spatial dependencies across all stations. This capability
empowers dispatchers to evaluate the impact of various terminal headway control
decisions without resorting to computationally intensive simulations. We
introduce a flexible methodology to simulate diverse dispatcher strategies,
ranging from maintaining even headways to implementing custom patterns derived
from observed terminal departures. In contrast to existing research primarily
focused on passenger load predictioning or atypical disruption scenarios, our
approach emphasizes proactive operational control. Evaluated on a large-scale
dataset from an urban metro line, the proposed ConvLSTM model demonstrates
promising headway predictions, offering actionable insights for real-time
decision-making. This framework provides rail operators with a powerful,
computationally efficient tool to optimize dispatching strategies, thereby
significantly improving service consistency and passenger satisfaction.

Abstract: Robust asset allocation is a key challenge in quantitative finance, where
deep-learning forecasters often fail due to objective mismatch and error
amplification. We introduce the Signature-Informed Transformer (SIT), a novel
framework that learns end-to-end allocation policies by directly optimizing a
risk-aware financial objective. SIT's core innovations include path signatures
for a rich geometric representation of asset dynamics and a signature-augmented
attention mechanism embedding financial inductive biases, like lead-lag
effects, into the model. Evaluated on daily S\&P 100 equity data, SIT
decisively outperforms traditional and deep-learning baselines, especially when
compared to predict-then-optimize models. These results indicate that
portfolio-aware objectives and geometry-aware inductive biases are essential
for risk-aware capital allocation in machine-learning systems. The code is

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence has become a crucial area of research,
aiming to demystify the decision-making processes of deep learning models.
Among various explainability techniques, counterfactual explanations have been
proven particularly promising, as they offer insights into model behavior by
highlighting minimal changes that would alter a prediction. Despite their
potential, these explanations are often complex and technical, making them
difficult for non-experts to interpret. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages Language Models, large and small, to compose
narratives for counterfactual explanations. We employ knowledge distillation
techniques along with a refining mechanism to enable Small Language Models to
perform comparably to their larger counterparts while maintaining robust
reasoning abilities. In addition, we introduce a simple but effective
evaluation method to assess natural language narratives, designed to verify
whether the models' responses are in line with the factual, counterfactual
ground truth. As a result, our proposed pipeline enhances both the reasoning
capabilities and practical performance of student models, making them more
suitable for real-world use cases.

Conclusion: VGB通过理论基础的随机游走和回溯机制，显著提升了验证器错误下的鲁棒性，为过程引导推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Test-time algorithms that combine the generative power of language models
with process verifiers that assess the quality of partial generations offer a
promising lever for eliciting new reasoning capabilities, but the algorithmic
design space and computational scaling properties of such approaches are still
opaque, and their benefits are far from apparent when one accounts for the cost
of learning a high-quality verifier. Our starting point is the observation that
seemingly benign errors in a learned verifier can lead to catastrophic failures
for standard decoding techniques due to error amplification during the course
of generation. We then ask: can this be improved with more sophisticated
decoding strategies?
  We introduce a new process-guided test-time sampling algorithm, VGB, which
uses theoretically grounded backtracking to achieve provably better robustness
to verifier errors. VGB interprets autoregressive generation as a random walk
on a tree of partial generations, with transition probabilities guided by the
process verifier and base model; crucially, backtracking occurs
probabilistically. This process generalizes the seminal Sinclair-Jerrum random
walk (Sinclair & Jerrum, 1989) from the literature on approximate counting and
sampling in theoretical computer science, and a conceptual contribution of our
work is to highlight parallels with this literature. Empirically, we
demonstrate on both synthetic and real language modeling tasks that VGB
outperforms baselines on a variety of metrics.

Conclusion: 理论上和实证上都表明混合专家学习中近似误差与估计误差之间的权衡取决于专家数量

Abstract: This paper uses classical high-rate quantization theory to provide new
insights into mixture-of-experts (MoE) models for regression tasks. Our MoE is
defined by a segmentation of the input space to regions, each with a
single-parameter expert that acts as a constant predictor with zero-compute at
inference. Motivated by high-rate quantization theory assumptions, we assume
that the number of experts is sufficiently large to make their input-space
regions very small. This lets us to study the approximation error of our MoE
model class: (i) for one-dimensional inputs, we formulate the test error and
its minimizing segmentation and experts; (ii) for multidimensional inputs, we
formulate an upper bound for the test error and study its minimization.
Moreover, we consider the learning of the expert parameters from a training
dataset, given an input-space segmentation, and formulate their statistical
learning properties. This leads us to theoretically and empirically show how
the tradeoff between approximation and estimation errors in MoE learning
depends on the number of experts.

Abstract: We study the problem of actively learning a classifier with a low calibration
error. One of the most popular Acquisition Functions (AFs) in pool-based Active
Learning (AL) is querying by the model's uncertainty. However, we recognize
that an uncalibrated uncertainty model on the unlabeled pool may significantly
affect the AF effectiveness, leading to sub-optimal generalization and high
calibration error on unseen data. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) make it even
worse as the model uncertainty from DNN is usually uncalibrated. Therefore, we
propose a new AF by estimating calibration errors and query samples with the
highest calibration error before leveraging DNN uncertainty. Specifically, we
utilize a kernel calibration error estimator under the covariate shift and
formally show that AL with this AF eventually leads to a bounded calibration
error on the unlabeled pool and unseen test data. Empirically, our proposed
method surpasses other AF baselines by having a lower calibration and
generalization error across pool-based AL settings.

TL;DR: 该论文为学习率预热（warm-up）提供了理论解释，证明在广义平滑性条件下，预热策略比固定步长能实现更快的收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习率预热已成为深度学习中的常用启发式方法，但其理论基础尚不明确，需要从理论上解释为什么预热能改善训练效果。

Method: 基于广义的(L₀,L₁)-平滑性条件，该条件将局部曲率限制为损失次优性的线性函数。在此假设下，分析带预热计划的梯度下降算法。

Result: 理论和实验证明，在均方误差和交叉熵损失训练的常见神经网络架构中，预热计划比固定步长实现更快的收敛速度，并建立了上下复杂度界限。

Conclusion: 预热策略在理论和实践中都显示出优势，通过语言和视觉模型的实验验证了理论见解，确认了预热计划的实际益处。

Abstract: Learning rate warm-up - increasing the learning rate at the beginning of
training - has become a ubiquitous heuristic in modern deep learning, yet its
theoretical foundations remain poorly understood. In this work, we provide a
principled explanation for why warm-up improves training. We rely on a
generalization of the $(L_0, L_1)$-smoothness condition, which bounds local
curvature as a linear function of the loss sub-optimality and exhibits
desirable closure properties. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically
that this condition holds for common neural architectures trained with
mean-squared error and cross-entropy losses. Under this assumption, we prove
that Gradient Descent with a warm-up schedule achieves faster convergence than
with a fixed step-size, establishing upper and lower complexity bounds.
Finally, we validate our theoretical insights through experiments on language
and vision models, confirming the practical benefits of warm-up schedules.

TL;DR: FTTE是一个半异步联邦学习框架，通过稀疏参数更新和基于更新时效性及方差的加权聚合，在资源受限的边缘设备上实现高效训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习在资源受限边缘设备部署时面临的内存、能耗和通信带宽限制，以及传统同步/异步方法在异构网络中因慢节点导致的延迟和收敛缓慢问题。

Method: 采用半异步联邦学习框架，结合稀疏参数更新和基于客户端更新时效性（年龄）和方差的加权聚合机制。

Result: 在500个客户端和90%慢节点的测试中，相比同步联邦学习（如FedAVG），FTTE实现了81%更快的收敛速度、80%更低的设备内存使用和69%的通信负载减少，同时达到与半异步方法（如FedBuff）相当或更高的目标精度。

Conclusion: FTTE是首个适用于异构和资源受限边缘设备实际部署的实用且可扩展的联邦学习解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed devices while preserving data privacy, but deployment on
resource-constrained edge nodes remains challenging due to limited memory,
energy, and communication bandwidth. Traditional synchronous and asynchronous
FL approaches further suffer from straggler induced delays and slow convergence
in heterogeneous, large scale networks. We present FTTE (Federated Tiny
Training Engine),a novel semi-asynchronous FL framework that uniquely employs
sparse parameter updates and a staleness-weighted aggregation based on both age
and variance of client updates. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
data distributions - including up to 500 clients and 90% stragglers -
demonstrate that FTTE not only achieves 81% faster convergence, 80% lower
on-device memory usage, and 69% communication payload reduction than
synchronous FL (eg.FedAVG), but also consistently reaches comparable or higher
target accuracy than semi-asynchronous (eg.FedBuff) in challenging regimes.
These results establish FTTE as the first practical and scalable solution for
real-world FL deployments on heterogeneous and predominantly
resource-constrained edge devices.

TL;DR: 提出DQUCB算法解决非平稳强化学习中的分布漂移问题，通过转移密度函数检测分布变化并改进Q-learning UCB的不确定性估计，在理论和实证上都优于传统QUCB。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统QUCB算法在非平稳RL环境中，当分布发生漂移时，学习到的策略可能会利用次优奖励，需要一种能够检测分布变化并平衡探索与利用的方法。

Method: 提出Density-QUCB算法，使用转移密度函数检测分布漂移，并利用其似然改进Q-learning UCB的不确定性估计质量。

Result: 理论证明DQUCB比QUCB具有更好的遗憾保证，实证显示在RL任务和真实COVID-19患者分配任务中，DQUCB计算高效且遗憾更低。

Conclusion: DQUCB算法有效解决了非平稳RL中的分布漂移问题，在理论和实际应用中均表现出色。

Abstract: We study the Non-Stationary Reinforcement Learning (RL) under distribution
shifts in both finite-horizon episodic and infinite-horizon discounted Markov
Decision Processes (MDPs). In the finite-horizon case, the transition functions
may suddenly change at a particular episode. In the infinite-horizon setting,
such changes can occur at an arbitrary time step during the agent's interaction
with the environment. While the Q-learning Upper Confidence Bound algorithm
(QUCB) can discover a proper policy during learning, due to the distribution
shifts, this policy can exploit sub-optimal rewards after the shift happens. To
address this issue, we propose Density-QUCB (DQUCB), a shift-aware
Q-learning~UCB algorithm, which uses a transition density function to detect
distribution shifts, then leverages its likelihood to enhance the uncertainty
estimation quality of Q-learning~UCB, resulting in a balance between
exploration and exploitation. Theoretically, we prove that our oracle DQUCB
achieves a better regret guarantee than QUCB. Empirically, our DQUCB enjoys the
computational efficiency of model-free RL and outperforms QUCB baselines by
having a lower regret across RL tasks, as well as a real-world COVID-19 patient
hospital allocation task using a Deep-Q-learning architecture.

Abstract: Benchmarks for competition-style reasoning have advanced evaluation in
mathematics and programming, yet physics remains comparatively explored. Most
existing physics benchmarks evaluate only final answers, which fail to capture
reasoning processes, while recent stepwise methods rely on heuristic
LLM-as-judge scoring or restrictive linear assumptions, limiting reliability
and diagnostic validity. We introduce PRISM-Physics, a process-level evaluation
framework and benchmark for complex physics reasoning problems. Solutions are
represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of formulas, explicitly encoding
causal dependencies among intermediate steps to enable fine-grained,
interpretable, and theoretically grounded scoring. We prove the optimality of
the DAG representation and the corresponding scoring policy. Combining with a
fully rule-based method for symbolic formula equivalence matching that we
developed, we ensure consistent validation across diverse formulations without
heuristic judgments. Results show that our evaluation framework is more aligned
with human experts' scoring. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs reveal
persistent reasoning failures in physics, while step-level scoring offers both
diagnostic insight and rich signals for later training. By combining structural
rigor, theoretical guarantees, and symbolic validation, PRISM-Physics provides
a principled foundation for advancing process-level evaluation and guiding the
development of models with deeper scientific reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: 叠加解耦对于映射度量揭示神经代码间真正的表示对齐是必要的。

Abstract: The superposition hypothesis states that a single neuron within a population
may participate in the representation of multiple features in order for the
population to represent more features than the number of neurons. In
neuroscience and AI, representational alignment metrics measure the extent to
which different deep neural networks (DNNs) or brains represent similar
information. In this work, we explore a critical question: \textit{does
superposition interact with alignment metrics in any undesirable way?} We
hypothesize that models which represent the same features in \textit{different
superposition arrangements}, i.e., their neurons have different linear
combinations of the features, will interfere with predictive mapping metrics
(semi-matching, soft-matching, linear regression), producing lower alignment
than expected. We first develop a theory for how the strict permutation metrics
are dependent on superposition arrangements. This is tested by training sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to disentangle superposition in toy models, where alignment
scores are shown to typically increase when a model's base neurons are replaced
with its sparse overcomplete latent codes. We find similar increases for
DNN\(\rightarrow\)DNN and DNN\(\rightarrow\)brain linear regression alignment
in the visual domain. Our results suggest that superposition disentanglement is
necessary for mapping metrics to uncover the true representational alignment
between neural codes.

TL;DR: 使用机器学习和可穿戴传感器（惯性传感器和肌电图）来估计单臂哑铃弯举时的主观疲劳程度（RPE），随机森林分类器表现最佳，准确率达到41.4%（精确匹配）和85.9%（±1 RPE范围）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估计主观疲劳程度（RPE）可以通过个性化反馈和预防伤害来增强抗阻训练效果。

Method: 收集了69组超过1000次重复的自定义数据集，使用可穿戴惯性传感器和肌电图传感器数据，提取统计特征训练机器学习模型。

Result: 随机森林分类器表现最佳，精确准确率为41.4%，±1 RPE准确率为85.9%；离心重复时间是最强的RPE预测因子；EMG数据仅略微提高了模型准确性。

Conclusion: 证明了基于可穿戴传感器的RPE估计的可行性，并指出了提高模型泛化能力的关键挑战。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of rating of perceived exertion (RPE) can enhance
resistance training through personalized feedback and injury prevention. This
study investigates the application of machine learning models to estimate RPE
during single-arm dumbbell bicep curls, using data from wearable inertial and
electromyography (EMG) sensors. A custom dataset of 69 sets and over 1000
repetitions was collected, with statistical features extracted for model
training. Among the models evaluated, a random forest classifier achieved the
highest performance, with 41.4% exact accuracy and 85.9% $\pm1$ RPE accuracy.
While the inclusion of EMG data slightly improved model accuracy over inertial
sensors alone, its utility may have been limited by factors such as data
quality and placement sensitivity. Feature analysis highlighted eccentric
repetition time as the strongest RPE predictor. The results demonstrate the
feasibility of wearable-sensor-based RPE estimation and identify key challenges
for improving model generalizability.

TL;DR: 提出了Best-of-Majority (BoM)推理策略，结合多数投票和Best-of-N的优势，在Pass@k设置下实现最优推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM推理策略（多数投票和Best-of-N）在困难任务中表现不佳，Pass@k评估显示单次选择往往表现不足，需要更好的推理扩展策略。

Method: 提出BoM策略，首先限制候选为高频响应，然后选择前k个奖励最高的响应，证明在采样预算N=Ω(C*)时具有最优后悔界。

Result: 理论证明BoM达到极小极大最优，实验结果显示在数学问题推理上优于多数投票和Best-of-N。

Conclusion: BoM是Pass@k推理设置下的最优策略，性能不会随N增加而下降，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: LLM inference often generates a batch of candidates for a prompt and selects
one via strategies like majority voting or Best-of- N (BoN). For difficult
tasks, this single-shot selection often underperforms. Consequently,
evaluations commonly report Pass@$k$: the agent may submit up to $k$ responses,
and only the best of them is used when computing regret. Motivated by this, we
study inference scaling in the more general Pass@$k$ inference setting, and
prove that neither majority voting nor BoN exhibits the desirable scaling with
$k$ and the sampling budget $N$. Combining the advantages of majority voting
and BoN, we propose a new inference strategy called Best-of-Majority (BoM),
with a pivotal step that restricts the candidates to the responses with high
frequency in the $N$ samples before selecting the top-$k$ rewards. We prove
that when the sampling budget is $N=\tilde\Omega(C^*)$, the regret of BoM is
$O(\epsilon_{\mathrm{opt}}+\sqrt{\epsilon_{\mathrm{RM}}^2C^*/k})$, where $C^*$
is the coverage coefficient, $\epsilon_{\mathrm{RM}}$ is the estimation error
of the reward model, and $\epsilon_{\mathrm{opt}}$ is the estimation error of
reward at the optimal response. We further establish a matching lower bound,
certifying that our algorithm is minimax optimal. Beyond optimality, BoM has a
key advantage: unlike majority voting and BoN, its performance does not degrade
when increasing $N$. Experimental results of inference on math problems show
BoM outperforming both majority voting and BoN.

Conclusion: 研究结果为有效利用特权信息提供了新指导原则，有望提升许多实际部分可观测领域中策略学习的效率。

Abstract: Partial observability is a notorious challenge in reinforcement learning
(RL), due to the need to learn complex, history-dependent policies. Recent
empirical successes have used privileged expert distillation--which leverages
availability of latent state information during training (e.g., from a
simulator) to learn and imitate the optimal latent, Markovian policy--to
disentangle the task of "learning to see" from "learning to act". While expert
distillation is more computationally efficient than RL without latent state
information, it also has well-documented failure modes. In this paper--through
a simple but instructive theoretical model called the perturbed Block MDP, and
controlled experiments on challenging simulated locomotion tasks--we
investigate the algorithmic trade-off between privileged expert distillation
and standard RL without privileged information. Our main findings are: (1) The
trade-off empirically hinges on the stochasticity of the latent dynamics, as
theoretically predicted by contrasting approximate decodability with belief
contraction in the perturbed Block MDP; and (2) The optimal latent policy is
not always the best latent policy to distill. Our results suggest new
guidelines for effectively exploiting privileged information, potentially
advancing the efficiency of policy learning across many practical partially
observable domains.

Conclusion: Lp-Reg通过保护推理火花有效解决了RLVR训练中的探索退化问题，实现了更稳定和有效的训练过程，在复杂推理任务上取得了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has propelled Large
Language Models in complex reasoning, yet its scalability is often hindered by
a training bottleneck where performance plateaus as policy entropy collapses,
signaling a loss of exploration. Previous methods typically address this by
maintaining high policy entropy, yet the precise mechanisms that govern
meaningful exploration have remained underexplored. Our analysis suggests that
an unselective focus on entropy risks amplifying irrelevant tokens and
destabilizing training. This paper investigates the exploration dynamics within
RLVR and identifies a key issue: the gradual elimination of valuable
low-probability exploratory tokens, which we term \textbf{\textit{reasoning
sparks}}. We find that while abundant in pre-trained models, these sparks are
systematically extinguished during RLVR due to over-penalization, leading to a
degeneracy in exploration. To address this, we introduce Low-probability
Regularization (Lp-Reg). Its core mechanism regularizes the policy towards a
heuristic proxy distribution. This proxy is constructed by filtering out
presumed noise tokens and re-normalizing the distribution over the remaining
candidates. The result is a less-noisy proxy where the probability of
\textit{reasoning sparks} is amplified, which then serves as a soft
regularization target to shield these valuable tokens from elimination via KL
divergence. Experiments show that Lp-Reg enables stable on-policy training for
around 1,000 steps, a regime where baseline entropy-control methods collapse.
This sustained exploration leads to state-of-the-art performance, achieving a
$60.17\%$ average accuracy on five math benchmarks, an improvement of $2.66\%$
over prior methods. Code is available at https://github.com/CarlanLark/Lp-Reg.
