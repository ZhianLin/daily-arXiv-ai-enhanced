*Yarin Bekor,Gal Michael Harari,Or Perel,Or Litany*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Gaussian See, Gaussian Do方法，实现多视角视频的语义3D运动迁移，支持无绑定、跨类别的运动迁移，通过条件反演提取运动嵌入并监督动态3D高斯溅射重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法在语义3D运动迁移中缺乏跨视角一致性和结构保持的问题，建立首个语义3D运动迁移基准。

Method: 使用条件反演从源视频提取运动嵌入，应用到静态目标形状的渲染帧，通过监督动态3D高斯溅射重建；引入基于锚点的视角感知运动嵌入机制和鲁棒的4D重建流程。

Result: 在建立的基准上展示了优越的运动保真度和结构一致性，相比适应基线方法表现更好。

Abstract: We present Gaussian See, Gaussian Do, a novel approach for semantic 3D motion transfer from multiview video. Our method enables rig-free, cross-category motion transfer between objects with semantically meaningful correspondence. Building on implicit motion transfer techniques, we extract motion embeddings from source videos via condition inversion, apply them to rendered frames of static target shapes, and use the resulting videos to supervise dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction. Our approach introduces an anchor-based view-aware motion embedding mechanism, ensuring cross-view consistency and accelerating convergence, along with a robust 4D reconstruction pipeline that consolidates noisy supervision videos. We establish the first benchmark for semantic 3D motion transfer and demonstrate superior motion fidelity and structural consistency compared to adapted baselines.

### [2] [CPSL: Representing Volumetric Video via Content-Promoted Scene Layers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14927)
*Kaiyuan Hu,Yili Jin,Junhua Liu,Xize Duan,Hong Kang,Xue Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CPSL（内容促进场景层）方法，将2D视频转换为紧凑的2.5D表示，通过深度和内容显著性引导的层分解实现视差校正的新视角合成，无需昂贵3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有体积视频表示（从显式点云到隐式神经场）在捕获、计算和渲染方面成本高昂，限制了按需视频的可扩展性和实时通信的可行性。

Method: 基于每帧深度和内容显著性，将帧分解为少量几何一致层，配备软alpha带和边缘深度缓存；通过深度加权变形和前后alpha合成实现视差校正；使用运动引导传播和逐层编码保持时间一致性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，CPSL相比基于层和神经场的基线方法实现了更优的感知质量和边界保真度，同时将存储和渲染成本降低数倍。

Conclusion: CPSL为从2D视频到可扩展2.5D沉浸式媒体提供了一条实用路径，将体积视频的感知优势带给传统2D内容。

Abstract: Volumetric video enables immersive and interactive visual experiences by supporting free viewpoint exploration and realistic motion parallax. However, existing volumetric representations from explicit point clouds to implicit neural fields, remain costly in capture, computation, and rendering, which limits their scalability for on-demand video and reduces their feasibility for real-time communication.
  To bridge this gap, we propose Content-Promoted Scene Layers (CPSL), a compact 2.5D video representation that brings the perceptual benefits of volumetric video to conventional 2D content. Guided by per-frame depth and content saliency, CPSL decomposes each frame into a small set of geometry-consistent layers equipped with soft alpha bands and an edge-depth cache that jointly preserve occlusion ordering and boundary continuity. These lightweight, 2D-encodable assets enable parallax-corrected novel-view synthesis via depth-weighted warping and front-to-back alpha compositing, bypassing expensive 3D reconstruction. Temporally, CPSL maintains inter-frame coherence using motion-guided propagation and per-layer encoding, supporting real-time playback with standard video codecs. Across multiple benchmarks, CPSL achieves superior perceptual quality and boundary fidelity compared with layer-based and neural-field baselines while reducing storage and rendering cost by several folds. Our approach offer a practical path from 2D video to scalable 2.5D immersive media.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究对12种先进架构在牙科全景X光片龋齿分割任务上进行基准测试，发现基于CNN的DoubleU-Net表现最佳，超越了Transformer和Mamba架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 牙科全景X光片中龋齿的准确识别和分割对早期诊断和治疗规划至关重要，但由于病变对比度低、形态多变和标注数据有限，自动分割仍具挑战性。

Method: 在DC1000数据集上，对12种最先进架构（包括CNN、Vision Transformer和状态空间Mamba架构）在相同配置下进行训练和评估。

Result: CNN-based的DoubleU-Net取得了最高的Dice系数0.7345、mIoU 0.5978和精度0.8145，在所有性能指标的前三名均由基于CNN的架构获得。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，在领域特定的医学图像分割中，架构与任务的匹配比模型复杂性更重要，Transformer和Mamba方法因数据有限和空间先验较弱而表现不佳。

Abstract: Accurate identification and segmentation of dental caries in panoramic radiographs are critical for early diagnosis and effective treatment planning. Automated segmentation remains challenging due to low lesion contrast, morphological variability, and limited annotated data. In this study, we present the first comprehensive benchmarking of convolutional neural networks, vision transformers and state-space mamba architectures for automated dental caries segmentation on panoramic radiographs through a DC1000 dataset. Twelve state-of-the-art architectures, including VMUnet, MambaUNet, VMUNetv2, RMAMamba-S, TransNetR, PVTFormer, DoubleU-Net, and ResUNet++, were trained under identical configurations. Results reveal that, contrary to the growing trend toward complex attention based architectures, the CNN-based DoubleU-Net achieved the highest dice coefficient of 0.7345, mIoU of 0.5978, and precision of 0.8145, outperforming all transformer and Mamba variants. In the study, the top 3 results across all performance metrics were achieved by CNN-based architectures. Here, Mamba and transformer-based methods, despite their theoretical advantage in global context modeling, underperformed due to limited data and weaker spatial priors. These findings underscore the importance of architecture-task alignment in domain-specific medical image segmentation more than model complexity. Our code is available at: https://github.com/JunZengz/dental-caries-segmentation.

### [5] [B-Rep Distance Functions (BR-DF): How to Represent a B-Rep Model by Volumetric Distance Functions?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14870)
*Fuyang Zhang,Pradeep Kumar Jayaraman,Xiang Xu,Yasutaka Furukawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于体积距离函数的CAD边界表示新几何表示方法BR-DF，通过多分支潜在扩散模型生成SDF和面UDFs，实现100%成功率的B-Rep模型生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CAD生成方法存在转换失败的问题，需要一种能够可靠生成水密CAD B-Rep模型的新表示方法。

Method: 使用BR-DF表示法，将CAD表面网格几何编码为SDF，将顶点、边、面及其拓扑信息编码为面UDFs，并扩展Marching Cubes算法直接转换为B-Rep模型。采用多分支潜在扩散模型和3D U-Net架构联合生成SDF和面UDFs。

Result: 实现了与SOTA方法相当的CAD生成性能，同时达到了前所未有的100%成功率生成（分面）B-Rep模型。

Conclusion: BR-DF表示法提供了一种可靠且高效的CAD模型生成方法，解决了传统方法中转换失败的问题。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel geometric representation for CAD Boundary Representation (B-Rep) based on volumetric distance functions, dubbed B-Rep Distance Functions (BR-DF). BR-DF encodes the surface mesh geometry of a CAD model as signed distance function (SDF). B-Rep vertices, edges, faces and their topology information are encoded as per-face unsigned distance functions (UDFs). An extension of the Marching Cubes algorithm converts BR-DF directly into watertight CAD B-Rep model (strictly speaking a faceted B-Rep model). A surprising characteristic of BR-DF is that this conversion process never fails. Leveraging the volumetric nature of BR-DF, we propose a multi-branch latent diffusion with 3D U-Net backbone for jointly generating the SDF and per-face UDFs of a BR-DF model. Our approach achieves comparable CAD generation performance against SOTA methods while reaching the unprecedented 100% success rate in producing (faceted) B-Rep models.

### [6] [Towards Unbiased Cross-Modal Representation Learning for Food Image-to-Recipe Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15201)
*Qing Wang,Chong-Wah Ngo,Ee-Peng Lim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于因果理论的食谱-食物图像跨模态检索方法，通过因果干预消除传统方法中由食材等因素引起的偏差，在Recipe1M数据集上实现了MedR=1的最优检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将食谱视为描述菜品视觉外观的文本源，但由于烹饪过程、菜品呈现和图像拍摄条件等因素，食物图像可能无法完全捕捉食谱的所有细节，导致相似性判断存在偏差。

Method: 使用因果理论建模跨模态表示学习中的偏差，将食材视为混淆因素，通过后门调整进行因果干预，并提出了一个即插即用的多标签食材分类器模块来消除偏差。

Result: 在Recipe1M数据集上实现了MedR=1的oracle检索性能，在1K、10K和50K测试数据规模下均表现优异，创造了新的最先进搜索性能。

Conclusion: 因果干预方法能有效消除食谱-食物图像检索中的偏差，显著提升跨模态检索性能，为类似问题提供了理论指导。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of learning representations for recipes and food images in the cross-modal retrieval problem. As the relationship between a recipe and its cooked dish is cause-and-effect, treating a recipe as a text source describing the visual appearance of a dish for learning representation, as the existing approaches, will create bias misleading image-and-recipe similarity judgment. Specifically, a food image may not equally capture every detail in a recipe, due to factors such as the cooking process, dish presentation, and image-capturing conditions. The current representation learning tends to capture dominant visual-text alignment while overlooking subtle variations that determine retrieval relevance. In this paper, we model such bias in cross-modal representation learning using causal theory. The causal view of this problem suggests ingredients as one of the confounder sources and a simple backdoor adjustment can alleviate the bias. By causal intervention, we reformulate the conventional model for food-to-recipe retrieval with an additional term to remove the potential bias in similarity judgment. Based on this theory-informed formulation, we empirically prove the oracle performance of retrieval on the Recipe1M dataset to be MedR=1 across the testing data sizes of 1K, 10K, and even 50K. We also propose a plug-and-play neural module, which is essentially a multi-label ingredient classifier for debiasing. New state-of-the-art search performances are reported on the Recipe1M dataset.

### [7] [GeoSceneGraph: Geometric Scene Graph Diffusion Model for Text-guided 3D Indoor Scene Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14884)
*Antonio Ruiz,Tao Wu,Andrew Melnik,Qing Cheng,Xuqin Wang,Lu Liu,Yongliang Wang,Yanfeng Zhang,Helge Ritter*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoSceneGraph是一种从文本提示合成3D室内场景的方法，利用场景的图结构和几何对称性，无需预定义关系类别或真实关系标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么从头训练生成模型，要么依赖视觉语言模型，但前者忽略室内场景的图结构限制场景连贯性，后者需要用户提供的语义图或真实关系标注，限制了对象交互的多样性。

Method: 基于等变图神经网络(EGNNs)，提出简单有效的文本特征条件化策略，利用3D场景的图结构和几何对称性，无需预定义关系类别。

Result: 尽管不使用真实关系，GeoSceneGraph实现了与使用真实关系方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: GeoSceneGraph通过结合图结构和几何对称性，有效解决了3D场景合成中的连贯性和多样性问题，为资源受限设备提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Methods that synthesize indoor 3D scenes from text prompts have wide-ranging applications in film production, interior design, video games, virtual reality, and synthetic data generation for training embodied agents. Existing approaches typically either train generative models from scratch or leverage vision-language models (VLMs). While VLMs achieve strong performance, particularly for complex or open-ended prompts, smaller task-specific models remain necessary for deployment on resource-constrained devices such as extended reality (XR) glasses or mobile phones. However, many generative approaches that train from scratch overlook the inherent graph structure of indoor scenes, which can limit scene coherence and realism. Conversely, methods that incorporate scene graphs either demand a user-provided semantic graph, which is generally inconvenient and restrictive, or rely on ground-truth relationship annotations, limiting their capacity to capture more varied object interactions. To address these challenges, we introduce GeoSceneGraph, a method that synthesizes 3D scenes from text prompts by leveraging the graph structure and geometric symmetries of 3D scenes, without relying on predefined relationship classes. Despite not using ground-truth relationships, GeoSceneGraph achieves performance comparable to methods that do. Our model is built on equivariant graph neural networks (EGNNs), but existing EGNN approaches are typically limited to low-dimensional conditioning and are not designed to handle complex modalities such as text. We propose a simple and effective strategy for conditioning EGNNs on text features, and we validate our design through ablation studies.

*Pranav Indrakanti,Ivor Simpson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督的单图像双向MRI合成器，能够在高场强和超低场强MRI图像之间进行相互转换，基于物理原理模拟对比度变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MRI合成模型缺乏对高场强和超低场强MRI之间对比度变化的物理原理建模，需要开发基于物理驱动的双向合成方法。

Method: 使用前向模型模拟HF到ULF转换，通过估计组织类型信噪比；使用隐式神经表示网络进行超分辨率任务，同时预测组织分割和图像强度。

Result: 合成ULF图像中WM-GM对比度提高52%，64mT图像中提高37%；敏感性实验证明模型对目标对比度、噪声和初始种子的变化具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的基于物理原理的无监督双向MRI合成方法能够有效改善图像对比度，并展现出良好的鲁棒性。

Abstract: We present an unsupervised single image bidirectional Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) synthesizer that synthesizes an Ultra-Low Field (ULF) like image from a High-Field (HF) magnitude image and vice-versa. Unlike existing MRI synthesis models, our approach is inspired by the physics that drives contrast changes between HF and ULF MRIs. Our forward model simulates a HF to ULF transformation by estimating the tissue-type Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR) values based on target contrast values. For the Super-Resolution task, we used an Implicit Neural Representation (INR) network to synthesize HF image by simultaneously predicting tissue-type segmentations and image intensity without observed HF data. The proposed method is evaluated using synthetic ULF-like data from generated from standard 3T T$_1$-weighted images for qualitative assessments and paired 3T-64mT T$_1$-weighted images for validation experiments. WM-GM contrast improved by 52% in synthetic ULF-like images and 37% in 64mT images. Sensitivity experiments demonstrated the robustness of our forward model to variations in target contrast, noise and initial seeding.

### [9] [InstructMix2Mix: Consistent Sparse-View Editing Through Multi-View Model Personalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14899)
*Daniel Gilo,Or Litany*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出InstructMix2Mix框架，通过将2D扩散模型的编辑能力蒸馏到预训练的多视图扩散模型中，解决稀疏输入视图下的多视图图像编辑问题，显著提升跨视图一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于单场景神经场或时序注意力机制的方法在稀疏输入视图的多视图编辑中容易产生伪影和不一致编辑，需要更好的跨视图一致性解决方案。

Method: 用多视图扩散学生替换SDS中的传统神经场整合器，采用渐进式学生更新、专门设计的教师噪声调度器以及增强跨视图一致性的注意力修改。

Result: 实验表明I-Mix2Mix显著改善了多视图一致性，同时保持高质量的单帧编辑效果。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将2D扩散编辑能力蒸馏到多视图扩散模型中，利用数据驱动的3D先验实现更好的跨视图一致性编辑。

Abstract: We address the task of multi-view image editing from sparse input views, where the inputs can be seen as a mix of images capturing the scene from different viewpoints. The goal is to modify the scene according to a textual instruction while preserving consistency across all views. Existing methods, based on per-scene neural fields or temporal attention mechanisms, struggle in this setting, often producing artifacts and incoherent edits. We propose InstructMix2Mix (I-Mix2Mix), a framework that distills the editing capabilities of a 2D diffusion model into a pretrained multi-view diffusion model, leveraging its data-driven 3D prior for cross-view consistency. A key contribution is replacing the conventional neural field consolidator in Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) with a multi-view diffusion student, which requires novel adaptations: incremental student updates across timesteps, a specialized teacher noise scheduler to prevent degeneration, and an attention modification that enhances cross-view coherence without additional cost. Experiments demonstrate that I-Mix2Mix significantly improves multi-view consistency while maintaining high per-frame edit quality.

TL;DR: SkinR1是一个新颖的皮肤病视觉语言模型，通过结合基于教科书的深度推理和强化学习的泛化能力，解决了皮肤病诊断中的数据异质性、缺乏诊断理由和泛化能力有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在临床推理中的可信度和实用性受到数据异质性、缺乏可靠的诊断理由监督以及泛化能力有限的限制。

Method: 设计了基于教科书的推理生成器合成高质量诊断轨迹，用于监督微调；开发了结合疾病层次结构的新型强化学习范式，将推理模式迁移到大规模稀疏数据。

Result: 在多个皮肤病数据集上的广泛实验表明，SkinR1实现了卓越的诊断准确性。消融研究证明了监督微调建立的推理基础的重要性。

Conclusion: SkinR1通过统一的端到端框架有效解决了皮肤病诊断中的关键挑战，为临床推理提供了可靠且可泛化的解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of vision-language models (VLMs) has opened new possibilities for clinical reasoning and has shown promising performance in dermatological diagnosis. However, their trustworthiness and clinical utility are often limited by three major factors: (1) Data heterogeneity, where diverse datasets lack consistent diagnostic labels and clinical concept annotations; (2) Absence of grounded diagnostic rationales, leading to a scarcity of reliable reasoning supervision; and (3) Limited scalability and generalization, as models trained on small, densely annotated datasets struggle to transfer nuanced reasoning to large, sparsely-annotated ones.
  To address these limitations, we propose SkinR1, a novel dermatological VLM that combines deep, textbook-based reasoning with the broad generalization capabilities of reinforcement learning (RL). SkinR1 systematically resolves the key challenges through a unified, end-to-end framework. First, we design a textbook-based reasoning generator that synthesizes high-fidelity, hierarchy-aware, and differential-diagnosis (DDx)-informed trajectories, providing reliable expert-level supervision. Second, we leverage the constructed trajectories for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) empowering the model with grounded reasoning ability. Third, we develop a novel RL paradigm that, by incorporating the hierarchical structure of diseases, effectively transfers these grounded reasoning patterns to large-scale, sparse data. Extensive experiments on multiple dermatology datasets demonstrate that SkinR1 achieves superior diagnostic accuracy. The ablation study demonstrates the importance of the reasoning foundation instilled by SFT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FarSLIP是一个针对遥感领域的细粒度语言-图像预训练框架，通过构建首个多粒度遥感图像-文本数据集MGRS-200k，采用补丁到补丁蒸馏和CLS令牌区域类别对齐方法，显著提升了遥感图像的细粒度视觉-语言对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP的全局对齐限制了其捕捉细粒度细节的能力，现有遥感专用CLIP变体仍存在空间感知有限的问题。主要原因是当前遥感图像-文本数据集生成全局描述时未充分利用对象级监督，以及通用领域区域-文本对齐方法直接应用于遥感数据会导致性能下降。

Method: 构建MGRS-200k多粒度遥感图像-文本数据集；采用补丁到补丁蒸馏而非常用的补丁到CLS自蒸馏，对齐局部和全局视觉线索；使用简单的CLS令牌区域类别对齐而非显式补丁级对齐来有效利用区域-文本监督。

Result: FarSLIP在遥感开放词汇语义分割、零样本分类和图像-文本检索等任务上均达到新的最先进水平，显著提升了遥感领域的细粒度视觉-语言对齐能力。

Conclusion: FarSLIP通过创新的补丁到补丁蒸馏和CLS令牌对齐策略，成功解决了遥感领域细粒度视觉-语言对齐的挑战，为遥感图像理解提供了更强大的基础模型。

Abstract: As CLIP's global alignment limits its ability to capture fine-grained details, recent efforts have focused on enhancing its region-text alignment. However, current remote sensing (RS)-specific CLIP variants still inherit this limited spatial awareness. We identify two key limitations behind this: (1) current RS image-text datasets generate global captions from object-level labels, leaving the original object-level supervision underutilized; (2) despite the success of region-text alignment methods in general domain, their direct application to RS data often leads to performance degradation. To address these, we construct the first multi-granularity RS image-text dataset, MGRS-200k, featuring rich object-level textual supervision for RS region-category alignment. We further investigate existing fine-grained CLIP tuning strategies and find that current explicit region-text alignment methods, whether in a direct or indirect way, underperform due to severe degradation of CLIP's semantic coherence. Building on these, we propose FarSLIP, a Fine-grained Aligned RS Language-Image Pretraining framework. Rather than the commonly used patch-to-CLS self-distillation, FarSLIP employs patch-to-patch distillation to align local and global visual cues, which improves feature discriminability while preserving semantic coherence. Additionally, to effectively utilize region-text supervision, it employs simple CLS token-based region-category alignment rather than explicit patch-level alignment, further enhancing spatial awareness. FarSLIP features improved fine-grained vision-language alignment in RS domain and sets a new state of the art not only on RS open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, but also on image-level tasks such as zero-shot classification and image-text retrieval. Our dataset, code, and models are available at https://github.com/NJU-LHRS/FarSLIP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前病理基础模型能够从全切片图像中提取丰富的斑块级特征，但将这些特征聚合为切片级预测的方法存在设计限制，影响了泛化性和可靠性。

Method: nnMIL引入斑块级和特征级的随机采样，支持大批量优化和任务感知采样策略，使用轻量级聚合器进行滑动窗口推断生成集成预测。

Result: 在35个临床任务和4个病理基础模型上，nnMIL在疾病诊断、组织学分型、分子生物标志物检测和泛癌预后预测方面均优于现有MIL方法，展现出强大的跨模型泛化能力和可靠的不确定性量化。

Conclusion: nnMIL为将病理基础模型转化为临床有意义的预测提供了实用且可泛化的解决方案，推动了可靠AI系统在真实世界环境中的开发和部署。

Abstract: Computational pathology holds substantial promise for improving diagnosis and guiding treatment decisions. Recent pathology foundation models enable the extraction of rich patch-level representations from large-scale whole-slide images (WSIs), but current approaches for aggregating these features into slide-level predictions remain constrained by design limitations that hinder generalizability and reliability. Here, we developed nnMIL, a simple yet broadly applicable multiple-instance learning framework that connects patch-level foundation models to robust slide-level clinical inference. nnMIL introduces random sampling at both the patch and feature levels, enabling large-batch optimization, task-aware sampling strategies, and efficient and scalable training across datasets and model architectures. A lightweight aggregator performs sliding-window inference to generate ensemble slide-level predictions and supports principled uncertainty estimation. Across 40,000 WSIs encompassing 35 clinical tasks and four pathology foundation models, nnMIL consistently outperformed existing MIL methods for disease diagnosis, histologic subtyping, molecular biomarker detection, and pan- cancer prognosis prediction. It further demonstrated strong cross-model generalization, reliable uncertainty quantification, and robust survival stratification in multiple external cohorts. In conclusion, nnMIL offers a practical and generalizable solution for translating pathology foundation models into clinically meaningful predictions, advancing the development and deployment of reliable AI systems in real-world settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-WIN是一个新颖的CXR世界模型，通过从胸部CT中提取体积知识，在潜在空间中学习预测其2D投影，以解决CXR结构叠加的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CXR作为2D投影图像，受限于结构叠加，无法捕捉3D解剖结构，这给表示学习和疾病诊断带来了挑战。

Method: 提出X-WIN模型，通过预测3D空间中各种变换下的CXR来内化3D解剖结构知识；引入亲和力引导的对比对齐损失；结合真实CXR进行训练，使用掩码图像建模和域分类器。

Result: X-WIN在多种下游任务上优于现有基础模型，在线性探测和少样本微调中表现优异，并能够渲染2D投影以重建3D CT体积。

Conclusion: X-WIN通过从CT中提取体积知识，有效解决了CXR的3D结构表示问题，在疾病诊断和3D重建方面展现出强大能力。

Abstract: Chest X-ray radiography (CXR) is an essential medical imaging technique for disease diagnosis. However, as 2D projectional images, CXRs are limited by structural superposition and hence fail to capture 3D anatomies. This limitation makes representation learning and disease diagnosis challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a novel CXR world model named X-WIN, which distills volumetric knowledge from chest computed tomography (CT) by learning to predict its 2D projections in latent space. The core idea is that a world model with internalized knowledge of 3D anatomical structure can predict CXRs under various transformations in 3D space. During projection prediction, we introduce an affinity-guided contrastive alignment loss that leverages mutual similarities to capture rich, correlated information across projections from the same volume. To improve model adaptability, we incorporate real CXRs into training through masked image modeling and employ a domain classifier to encourage statistically similar representations for real and simulated CXRs. Comprehensive experiments show that X-WIN outperforms existing foundation models on diverse downstream tasks using linear probing and few-shot fine-tuning. X-WIN also demonstrates the ability to render 2D projections for reconstructing a 3D CT volume.

Abstract: Periodic human activities with implicit workflows are common in manufacturing, sports, and daily life. While short-term periodic activities -- characterized by simple structures and high-contrast patterns -- have been widely studied, long-term periodic workflows with low-contrast patterns remain largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first benchmark comprising 580 multimodal human activity sequences featuring long-term periodic workflows. The benchmark supports three evaluation tasks aligned with real-world applications: unsupervised periodic workflow detection, task completion tracking, and procedural anomaly detection. We also propose a lightweight, training-free baseline for modeling diverse periodic workflow patterns. Experiments show that: (i) our benchmark presents significant challenges to both unsupervised periodic detection methods and zero-shot approaches based on powerful large language models (LLMs); (ii) our baseline outperforms competing methods by a substantial margin in all evaluation tasks; and (iii) in real-world applications, our baseline demonstrates deployment advantages on par with traditional supervised workflow detection approaches, eliminating the need for annotation and retraining.

TL;DR: 提出了一种低成本、通用的多视角视频同步方法，使用LED时钟编码时间信息，实现毫秒级时间对齐，适用于可见光和红外相机系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视角视频流的时空对齐对于3D重建、姿态估计等应用至关重要，但在异构相机系统中硬件同步往往不可用，特别是在真实环境中难以实现控制拍摄条件。

Method: 使用定制的LED时钟，通过红色和红外LED编码时间信息，从录制帧中视觉解码曝光窗口（开始和结束时间）来实现毫秒级同步。

Result: 与硬件同步基准相比，实现了1.34毫秒RMSE的残差误差；在实验中优于基于光、音频和时间码的同步方法，并直接改善了多视角姿态估计和3D重建等下游计算机视觉任务。

Conclusion: 该方法简化了同步流程，扩展了在无约束环境（包括工业和临床应用）中基于视觉的先进传感技术的应用范围。

Abstract: Accurate spatiotemporal alignment of multi-view video streams is essential for a wide range of dynamic-scene applications such as multi-view 3D reconstruction, pose estimation, and scene understanding. However, synchronizing multiple cameras remains a significant challenge, especially in heterogeneous setups combining professional and consumer-grade devices, visible and infrared sensors, or systems with and without audio, where common hardware synchronization capabilities are often unavailable. This limitation is particularly evident in real-world environments, where controlled capture conditions are not feasible. In this work, we present a low-cost, general-purpose synchronization method that achieves millisecond-level temporal alignment across diverse camera systems while supporting both visible (RGB) and infrared (IR) modalities. The proposed solution employs a custom-built \textit{LED Clock} that encodes time through red and infrared LEDs, allowing visual decoding of the exposure window (start and end times) from recorded frames for millisecond-level synchronization. We benchmark our method against hardware synchronization and achieve a residual error of 1.34~ms RMSE across multiple recordings. In further experiments, our method outperforms light-, audio-, and timecode-based synchronization approaches and directly improves downstream computer vision tasks, including multi-view pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. Finally, we validate the system in large-scale surgical recordings involving over 25 heterogeneous cameras spanning both IR and RGB modalities. This solution simplifies and streamlines the synchronization pipeline and expands access to advanced vision-based sensing in unconstrained environments, including industrial and clinical applications.

<details>

Motivation: 解决激光切割中能耗高、环境影响大的问题，特别是CO2激光抽气泵缺乏自适应控制和开环运行的现状

Method: 采用闭环配置，结合基于无透镜散斑传感的定制CNN和基于USB摄像头与VGG16迁移学习的材料分类方法，以及独立的烟雾检测DL模型

Result: 实验证明抽气泵能耗降低20%-50%，在空闲时自动停止，运行时动态调节功率

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低激光切割能耗，为制造业可持续发展做出重要贡献

Abstract: This research addresses the significant challenges of energy consumption and environmental impact in laser cutting by proposing novel deep learning (DL) methodologies to achieve energy reduction. Recognizing the current lack of adaptive control and the open-loop nature of CO2 laser suction pumps, this study utilizes closed-loop configurations that dynamically adjust pump power based on both the material being cut and the smoke level generated. To implement this adaptive system, diverse material classification methods are introduced, including techniques leveraging lens-less speckle sensing with a customized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and an approach using a USB camera with transfer learning via the pre-trained VGG16 CNN model. Furthermore, a separate DL model for smoke level detection is employed to simultaneously refine the pump's power output. This integration prompts the exhaust suction pump to automatically halt during inactive times and dynamically adjust power during operation, leading to experimentally proven and remarkable energy savings, with results showing a 20% to 50% reduction in the smoke suction pump's energy consumption, thereby contributing substantially to sustainable development in the manufacturing sector.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对多模态检索增强生成(MRAG)系统的视觉攻击方法，通过仅对用户输入的图像添加不可察觉的扰动，就能破坏系统的检索和生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MRAG系统存在安全漏洞，但之前的研究主要关注知识投毒攻击。本文考虑仅通过视觉扰动攻击MRAG系统，这在技术上更具挑战性。

Method: 提出分层视觉攻击方法，通过两阶段策略：首先破坏跨模态对齐，然后破坏多模态语义对齐，使检索器召回不相关知识，从而混淆生成器的输出。

Result: 在OK-VQA和InfoSeek数据集上的实验表明，该方法能显著降低MRAG系统的检索和生成性能，使用CLIP检索器和BLIP-2、LLaVA生成器均有效。

Conclusion: 视觉攻击对MRAG系统构成严重威胁，即使不操纵其他组件，仅通过图像扰动就能破坏系统性能，揭示了MRAG系统的安全脆弱性。

Abstract: Advanced multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) techniques have been widely applied to enhance the capabilities of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), but they also bring along novel safety issues. Existing adversarial research has revealed the vulnerability of MRAG systems to knowledge poisoning attacks, which fool the retriever into recalling injected poisoned contents. However, our work considers a different setting: visual attack of MRAG by solely adding imperceptible perturbations at the image inputs of users, without manipulating any other components. This is challenging due to the robustness of fine-tuned retrievers and large-scale generators, and the effect of visual perturbation may be further weakened by propagation through the RAG chain. We propose a novel Hierarchical Visual Attack that misaligns and disrupts the two inputs (the multimodal query and the augmented knowledge) of MRAG's generator to confuse its generation. We further design a hierarchical two-stage strategy to obtain misaligned augmented knowledge. We disrupt the image input of the retriever to make it recall irrelevant knowledge from the original database, by optimizing the perturbation which first breaks the cross-modal alignment and then disrupts the multimodal semantic alignment. We conduct extensive experiments on two widely-used MRAG datasets: OK-VQA and InfoSeek. We use CLIP-based retrievers and two LMMs BLIP-2 and LLaVA as generators. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our visual attack on MRAG through the significant decrease in both retrieval and generation performance.

TL;DR: 提出了Edge-Guided Spatial Attention (EGSA)融合机制，通过将边界信息融入语义和几何特征融合中，减少多任务学习中的负面跨任务交互，提升透明物体感知性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 透明物体感知是计算机视觉中的主要挑战，因为透明度会混淆深度估计和语义分割。现有的多任务学习框架存在负面跨任务交互问题，阻碍性能提升。

Method: 引入EGSA融合机制，将边界信息融入语义和几何特征融合；提出多模态渐进训练策略，从RGB图像边缘学习过渡到预测深度图像边缘学习。

Result: 在Syn-TODD和ClearPose基准测试中，EGSA持续提升了深度估计精度，优于当前最先进方法(MODEST)，同时保持有竞争力的分割性能，在透明区域改进最大。

Conclusion: 边缘引导融合是一种稳健的方法，能够有效改善透明物体感知，无需训练时的真实深度数据。

Abstract: Transparent object perception remains a major challenge in computer vision research, as transparency confounds both depth estimation and semantic segmentation. Recent work has explored multi-task learning frameworks to improve robustness, yet negative cross-task interactions often hinder performance. In this work, we introduce Edge-Guided Spatial Attention (EGSA), a fusion mechanism designed to mitigate destructive interactions by incorporating boundary information into the fusion between semantic and geometric features. On both Syn-TODD and ClearPose benchmarks, EGSA consistently improved depth accuracy over the current state of the art method (MODEST), while preserving competitive segmentation performance, with the largest improvements appearing in transparent regions. Besides our fusion design, our second contribution is a multi-modal progressive training strategy, where learning transitions from edges derived from RGB images to edges derived from predicted depth images. This approach allows the system to bootstrap learning from the rich textures contained in RGB images, and then switch to more relevant geometric content in depth maps, while it eliminates the need for ground-truth depth at training time. Together, these contributions highlight edge-guided fusion as a robust approach capable of improving transparent object perception.

Motivation: 现有的特征知识蒸馏方法通常同时使用基于logits和中间层特征的损失函数，本文旨在探索仅使用基于特征损失的知识蒸馏框架的有效性。

Method: 利用潜在表示几何特性的新发现，引入知识质量指标来识别教师模型中最有效的知识层，仅使用基于特征的损失函数训练学生模型的主干网络。

Result: 在三个图像分类数据集和四种不同的师生模型对上进行的实验表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能，相比标准方法提升了高达15%的top-1准确率。

Conclusion: 仅使用基于特征损失的知识蒸馏框架是有效的，通过识别教师模型中最具知识质量的层可以显著提升学生模型的性能。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) methods can transfer knowledge of a parameter-heavy teacher model to a light-weight student model. The status quo for feature KD methods is to utilize loss functions based on logits (i.e., pre-softmax class scores) and intermediate layer features (i.e., latent representations). Unlike previous approaches, we propose a feature KD framework for training the student's backbone using feature-based losses exclusively (i.e., without logit-based losses such as cross entropy). Leveraging recent discoveries about the geometry of latent representations, we introduce a knowledge quality metric for identifying which teacher layers provide the most effective knowledge for distillation. Experiments on three image classification datasets with four diverse student-teacher pairs, spanning convolutional neural networks and vision transformers, demonstrate our KD method achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering top-1 accuracy boosts of up to 15% over standard approaches. We publically share our code to facilitate future work at https://github.com/Thegolfingocto/KD_wo_CE.

TL;DR: FinCriticalED是首个面向金融文档事实级理解的视觉基准测试，包含500个图像-HTML对，由金融专家标注了700多个数值和时间事实，用于评估OCR和视觉语言模型在关键金融事实提取上的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融文档具有视觉密集和表格繁多的布局，其中数值和时间信息与结构紧密耦合。在关键场景中，小的OCR错误（如符号反转或日期偏移）可能导致完全不同的解读，而传统OCR指标只关注表层文本相似性。

Method: 开发了包含500个图像-HTML对的基准数据集，所有标注由金融专家创建和验证，严格控制符号、数值大小和时间表达的质量。建立了基于LLM的评估流程，执行结构化事实提取和上下文验证。

Result: 虽然最强的专有模型达到了最高的事实准确性，但在视觉复杂的数值和时间上下文中仍然存在显著错误。通过定量评估和专家案例研究验证了基准的有效性。

Conclusion: FinCriticalED为金融和其他精度关键领域的视觉事实精度提供了严格的基础，将评估重点从词汇重叠转向领域关键的事实正确性。

Abstract: We introduce FinCriticalED (Financial Critical Error Detection), a visual benchmark for evaluating OCR and vision language models on financial documents at the fact level. Financial documents contain visually dense and table heavy layouts where numerical and temporal information is tightly coupled with structure. In high stakes settings, small OCR mistakes such as sign inversion or shifted dates can lead to materially different interpretations, while traditional OCR metrics like ROUGE and edit distance capture only surface level text similarity. \ficriticaled provides 500 image-HTML pairs with expert annotated financial facts covering over seven hundred numerical and temporal facts. It introduces three key contributions. First, it establishes the first fact level evaluation benchmark for financial document understanding, shifting evaluation from lexical overlap to domain critical factual correctness. Second, all annotations are created and verified by financial experts with strict quality control over signs, magnitudes, and temporal expressions. Third, we develop an LLM-as-Judge evaluation pipeline that performs structured fact extraction and contextual verification for visually complex financial documents. We benchmark OCR systems, open source vision language models, and proprietary models on FinCriticalED. Results show that although the strongest proprietary models achieve the highest factual accuracy, substantial errors remain in visually intricate numerical and temporal contexts. Through quantitative evaluation and expert case studies, FinCriticalED provides a rigorous foundation for advancing visual factual precision in financial and other precision critical domains.

Conclusion: CKDA方法通过明确分离和平衡保存模态特定知识和模态公共知识，有效解决了VI-LReID中的知识干扰问题，实现了更好的性能。

Abstract: Lifelong person Re-IDentification (LReID) aims to match the same person employing continuously collected individual data from different scenarios. To achieve continuous all-day person matching across day and night, Visible-Infrared Lifelong person Re-IDentification (VI-LReID) focuses on sequential training on data from visible and infrared modalities and pursues average performance over all data. To this end, existing methods typically exploit cross-modal knowledge distillation to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting of old knowledge. However, these methods ignore the mutual interference of modality-specific knowledge acquisition and modality-common knowledge anti-forgetting, where conflicting knowledge leads to collaborative forgetting. To address the above problems, this paper proposes a Cross-modality Knowledge Disentanglement and Alignment method, called CKDA, which explicitly separates and preserves modality-specific knowledge and modality-common knowledge in a balanced way. Specifically, a Modality-Common Prompting (MCP) module and a Modality-Specific Prompting (MSP) module are proposed to explicitly disentangle and purify discriminative information that coexists and is specific to different modalities, avoiding the mutual interference between both knowledge. In addition, a Cross-modal Knowledge Alignment (CKA) module is designed to further align the disentangled new knowledge with the old one in two mutually independent inter- and intra-modality feature spaces based on dual-modality prototypes in a balanced manner. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness and superiority of our CKDA against state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We propose a new hologram representation based on structured complex-valued 2D Gaussian primitives, which replaces per-pixel information storage and reduces the parameter search space by up to 10:1. To enable end-to-end training, we develop a differentiable rasterizer for our representation, integrated with a GPU-optimized light propagation kernel in free space. Our extensive experiments show that our method achieves up to 2.5x lower VRAM usage and 50% faster optimization while producing higher-fidelity reconstructions than existing methods. We further introduce a conversion procedure that adapts our representation to practical hologram formats, including smooth and random phase-only holograms. Our experiments show that this procedure can effectively suppress noise artifacts observed in previous methods. By reducing the hologram parameter search space, our representation enables a more scalable hologram estimation in the next-generation computer-generated holography systems.

Conclusion: 计算机视觉模型在理解人类数学认知发展方面具有潜力，为未来研究探索更多模型架构和构建更大基准指明了方向。

Abstract: Mathematical thinking is a fundamental aspect of human cognition. Cognitive scientists have investigated the mechanisms that underlie our ability to thinking geometrically and numerically, to take two prominent examples, and developmental scientists have documented the trajectories of these abilities over the lifespan. Prior research has shown that computer vision (CV) models trained on the unrelated task of image classification nevertheless learn latent representations of geometric and numerical concepts similar to those of adults. Building on this demonstrated cognitive alignment, the current study investigates whether CV models also show developmental alignment: whether their performance improvements across training to match the developmental progressions observed in children. In a detailed case study of the ResNet-50 model, we show that this is the case. For the case of geometry and topology, we find developmental alignment for some classes of concepts (Euclidean Geometry, Geometrical Figures, Metric Properties, Topology) but not others (Chiral Figures, Geometric Transformations, Symmetrical Figures). For the case of number, we find developmental alignment in the emergence of a human-like ``mental number line'' representation with experience. These findings show the promise of computer vision models for understanding the development of mathematical understanding in humans. They point the way to future research exploring additional model architectures and building larger benchmarks.

Abstract: In the field of human-object interaction (HOI), detection and generation are two dual tasks that have traditionally been addressed separately, hindering the development of comprehensive interaction understanding. To address this, we propose UniHOI, which jointly models HOI detection and generation via a unified token space, thereby effectively promoting knowledge sharing and enhancing generalization. Specifically, we introduce a symmetric interaction-aware attention module and a unified semi-supervised learning paradigm, enabling effective bidirectional mapping between images and interaction semantics even under limited annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniHOI achieves state-of-the-art performance in both HOI detection and generation. Specifically, UniHOI improves accuracy by 4.9% on long-tailed HOI detection and boosts interaction metrics by 42.0% on open-vocabulary generation tasks.

TL;DR: 提出DLRRF模型处理高光谱和多光谱图像融合中的图像间变异问题，通过将光谱变异建模为光谱退化算子的变化，并分解目标图像为低秩和残差分量来恢复空间细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于采集条件不同，高光谱图像(HSI)和多光谱图像(MSI)之间存在光谱变异和空间局部变化，这种图像间变异严重影响融合性能。现有方法通常直接对图像进行变换，这会加剧融合模型的不适定性。

Method: 1) 将光谱变异建模为光谱退化算子的变化；2) 将目标HSI分解为低秩和残差分量，残差分量用于捕捉丢失的细节；3) 利用图像内的光谱相关性对两个分量进行降维；4) 引入隐式正则化器利用图像的空间先验信息；5) 在即插即用框架下使用近端交替优化算法求解。

Result: 广泛的数值实验表明，DLRRF在存在图像间变异的情况下，能够实现HSI和MSI融合的优越性能。

Conclusion: DLRRF模型有效解决了HSI和MSI融合中的图像间变异问题，通过将光谱变异建模为退化算子变化和图像分解方法，显著提升了融合性能。

Abstract: The fusion of hyperspectral image (HSI) with multispectral image (MSI) provides an effective way to enhance the spatial resolution of HSI. However, due to different acquisition conditions, there may exist spectral variability and spatially localized changes between HSI and MSI, referred to as inter-image variability, which can significantly affect the fusion performance. Existing methods typically handle inter-image variability by applying direct transformations to the images themselves, which can exacerbate the ill-posedness of the fusion model. To address this challenge, we propose a Degradation-based Low-Rank and Residual Fusion (DLRRF) model. First, we model the spectral variability as change in the spectral degradation operator. Second, to recover the lost spatial details caused by spatially localized changes, we decompose the target HSI into low rank and residual components, where the latter is used to capture the lost details. By exploiting the spectral correlation within the images, we perform dimensionality reduction on both components. Additionally, we introduce an implicit regularizer to utilize the spatial prior information from the images. The proposed DLRRF model is solved using the Proximal Alternating Optimization (PAO) algorithm within a Plug-and-Play (PnP) framework, where the subproblem regarding implicit regularizer is addressed by an external denoiser. We further provide a comprehensive convergence analysis of the algorithm. Finally, extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that DLRRF achieves superior performance in fusing HSI and MSI with inter-image variability.

Abstract: Accurate nuclei segmentation in microscopy whole slide images (WSIs) remains challenging due to variability in staining, imaging conditions, and tissue morphology. We propose CellGenNet, a knowledge distillation framework for robust cross-tissue cell segmentation under limited supervision. CellGenNet adopts a student-teacher architecture, where a capacity teacher is trained on sparse annotations and generates soft pseudo-labels for unlabeled regions. The student is optimized using a joint objective that integrates ground-truth labels, teacher-derived probabilistic targets, and a hybrid loss function combining binary cross-entropy and Tversky loss, enabling asymmetric penalties to mitigate class imbalance and better preserve minority nuclear structures. Consistency regularization and layerwise dropout further stabilize feature representations and promote reliable feature transfer. Experiments across diverse cancer tissue WSIs show that CellGenNet improves segmentation accuracy and generalization over supervised and semi-supervised baselines, supporting scalable and reproducible histopathology analysis.

Abstract: Shot assembly is a crucial step in film production and video editing, involving the sequencing and arrangement of shots to construct a narrative, convey information, or evoke emotions. Traditionally, this process has been manually executed by experienced editors. While current intelligent video editing technologies can handle some automated video editing tasks, they often fail to capture the creator's unique artistic expression in shot assembly. To address this challenge, we propose an energy-based optimization method for video shot assembly. Specifically, we first perform visual-semantic matching between the script generated by a large language model and a video library to obtain subsets of candidate shots aligned with the script semantics. Next, we segment and label the shots from reference videos, extracting attributes such as shot size, camera motion, and semantics. We then employ energy-based models to learn from these attributes, scoring candidate shot sequences based on their alignment with reference styles. Finally, we achieve shot assembly optimization by combining multiple syntax rules, producing videos that align with the assembly style of the reference videos. Our method not only automates the arrangement and combination of independent shots according to specific logic, narrative requirements, or artistic styles but also learns the assembly style of reference videos, creating a coherent visual sequence or holistic visual expression. With our system, even users with no prior video editing experience can create visually compelling videos. Project page: https://sobeymil.github.io/esa.com

Abstract: Existing approaches for the problem of ultrasound image segmentation, whether supervised or semi-supervised, are typically specialized for specific anatomical structures or tasks, limiting their practical utility in clinical settings. In this paper, we pioneer the task of universal semi-supervised ultrasound image segmentation and propose ProPL, a framework that can handle multiple organs and segmentation tasks while leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data. At its core, ProPL employs a shared vision encoder coupled with prompt-guided dual decoders, enabling flexible task adaptation through a prompting-upon-decoding mechanism and reliable self-training via an uncertainty-driven pseudo-label calibration (UPLC) module. To facilitate research in this direction, we introduce a comprehensive ultrasound dataset spanning 5 organs and 8 segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ProPL outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various metrics, establishing a new benchmark for universal ultrasound image segmentation.

Motivation: 由于一些日文文档采用垂直书写方式，而现有研究对垂直书写日文文本的关注有限，需要评估MLLMs在此类文本上的阅读能力。

Method: 生成合成的日文OCR数据集（包含水平和垂直书写文本），并使用真实世界文档图像创建评估数据集，对现有MLLMs进行微调和评估。

Result: 现有MLLMs在垂直书写日文文本上的表现明显差于水平文本，但使用合成数据集微调后，原本无法处理垂直书写的模型性能得到显著提升。

Conclusion: 垂直书写日文文本对MLLMs构成挑战，但通过适当的训练数据可以改善模型在此类文本上的表现，相关数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have seen rapid advances in recent years and are now being applied to visual document understanding tasks. They are expected to process a wide range of document images across languages, including Japanese. Understanding documents from images requires models to read what are written in them. Since some Japanese documents are written vertically, support for vertical writing is essential. However, research specifically focused on vertically written Japanese text remains limited. In this study, we evaluate the reading capability of existing MLLMs on vertically written Japanese text. First, we generate a synthetic Japanese OCR dataset by rendering Japanese texts into images, and use it for both model fine-tuning and evaluation. This dataset includes Japanese text in both horizontal and vertical writing. We also create an evaluation dataset sourced from the real-world document images containing vertically written Japanese text. Using these datasets, we demonstrate that the existing MLLMs perform worse on vertically written Japanese text than on horizontally written Japanese text. Furthermore, we show that training MLLMs on our synthesized Japanese OCR dataset results in improving the performance of models that previously could not handle vertical writing. The datasets and code are publicly available https://github.com/llm-jp/eval_vertical_ja.

Abstract: Video Models have achieved remarkable success in high-fidelity video generation with coherent motion dynamics. Analogous to the development from text generation to text-based reasoning in language modeling, the development of video models motivates us to ask: Can video models reason via video generation? Compared with the discrete text corpus, video grounds reasoning in explicit spatial layouts and temporal continuity, which serves as an ideal substrate for spatial reasoning. In this work, we explore the reasoning via video paradigm and introduce VR-Bench -- a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate video models' reasoning capabilities. Grounded in maze-solving tasks that inherently require spatial planning and multi-step reasoning, VR-Bench contains 7,920 procedurally generated videos across five maze types and diverse visual styles. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that SFT can efficiently elicit the reasoning ability of video model. Video models exhibit stronger spatial perception during reasoning, outperforming leading VLMs and generalizing well across diverse scenarios, tasks, and levels of complexity. We further discover a test-time scaling effect, where diverse sampling during inference improves reasoning reliability by 10--20%. These findings highlight the unique potential and scalability of reasoning via video for spatial reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: BokehFlow证明了无需深度输入即可实现高质量可控散景渲染的可行性，为景深效果合成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Bokeh rendering simulates the shallow depth-of-field effect in photography, enhancing visual aesthetics and guiding viewer attention to regions of interest. Although recent approaches perform well, rendering controllable bokeh without additional depth inputs remains a significant challenge. Existing classical and neural controllable methods rely on accurate depth maps, while generative approaches often struggle with limited controllability and efficiency. In this paper, we propose BokehFlow, a depth-free framework for controllable bokeh rendering based on flow matching. BokehFlow directly synthesizes photorealistic bokeh effects from all-in-focus images, eliminating the need for depth inputs. It employs a cross-attention mechanism to enable semantic control over both focus regions and blur intensity via text prompts. To support training and evaluation, we collect and synthesize four datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BokehFlow achieves visually compelling bokeh effects and offers precise control, outperforming existing depth-dependent and generative methods in both rendering quality and efficiency.

Motivation: 解决高时间变化动态室外环境中LiDAR点云3D单目标跟踪面临的挑战，包括二次计算复杂度、时间冗余和几何先验利用不足等问题。

Method: 设计了基于Mamba的帧间传播模块替代传统单帧特征提取，实现近线性复杂度；引入分组特征增强模块在通道层面分离前景和背景语义，减少内存库中的时间冗余。

Result: 在KITTI-HTV和nuScenes-HTV基准测试中显著优于现有方法，在中等时间间隔下比HVTrack提升6.5%成功率和9.5%精度；在标准KITTI数据集上仍保持与最先进方法的竞争力。

Conclusion: MambaTrack3D实现了优异的精度-效率权衡，在专门的高时间变化场景和常规跟踪场景中均表现出鲁棒性能，具有强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Dynamic outdoor environments with high temporal variation (HTV) pose significant challenges for 3D single object tracking in LiDAR point clouds. Existing memory-based trackers often suffer from quadratic computational complexity, temporal redundancy, and insufficient exploitation of geometric priors. To address these issues, we propose MambaTrack3D, a novel HTV-oriented tracking framework built upon the state space model Mamba. Specifically, we design a Mamba-based Inter-frame Propagation (MIP) module that replaces conventional single-frame feature extraction with efficient inter-frame propagation, achieving near-linear complexity while explicitly modeling spatial relations across historical frames. Furthermore, a Grouped Feature Enhancement Module (GFEM) is introduced to separate foreground and background semantics at the channel level, thereby mitigating temporal redundancy in the memory bank. Extensive experiments on KITTI-HTV and nuScenes-HTV benchmarks demonstrate that MambaTrack3D consistently outperforms both HTV-oriented and normal-scenario trackers, achieving improvements of up to 6.5 success and 9.5 precision over HVTrack under moderate temporal gaps. On the standard KITTI dataset, MambaTrack3D remains highly competitive with state-of-the-art normal-scenario trackers, confirming its strong generalization ability. Overall, MambaTrack3D achieves a superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off, delivering robust performance across both specialized HTV and conventional tracking scenarios.

Conclusion: TiCAL通过考虑模态一致性和在双曲空间中建模情感特征，显著提升了多模态情感识别性能，特别是在模态不一致的样本上表现优异。

Abstract: Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) aims to accurately identify human emotional states by integrating heterogeneous modalities such as visual, auditory, and textual data. Existing approaches predominantly rely on unified emotion labels to supervise model training, often overlooking a critical challenge: inter-modal emotion conflicts, wherein different modalities within the same sample may express divergent emotional tendencies. In this work, we address this overlooked issue by proposing a novel framework, Typicality-based Consistent-aware Multimodal Emotion Recognition (TiCAL), inspired by the stage-wise nature of human emotion perception. TiCAL dynamically assesses the consistency of each training sample by leveraging pseudo unimodal emotion labels alongside a typicality estimation. To further enhance emotion representation, we embed features in a hyperbolic space, enabling the capture of fine-grained distinctions among emotional categories. By incorporating consistency estimates into the learning process, our method improves model performance, particularly on samples exhibiting high modality inconsistency. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, e.g, CMU-MOSEI and MER2023, validate the effectiveness of TiCAL in mitigating inter-modal emotional conflicts and enhancing overall recognition accuracy, e.g., with about 2.6% improvements over the state-of-the-art DMD.

Conclusion: JCDM支持可变数量的参考视角，可与标准扩散主干网络集成，实现最小化架构修改

Abstract: Pose-guided human image generation is limited by incomplete textures from single reference views and the absence of explicit cross-view interaction. We present jointly conditioned diffusion model (JCDM), a jointly conditioned diffusion framework that exploits multi-view priors. The appearance prior module (APM) infers a holistic identity preserving prior from incomplete references, and the joint conditional injection (JCI) mechanism fuses multi-view cues and injects shared conditioning into the denoising backbone to align identity, color, and texture across poses. JCDM supports a variable number of reference views and integrates with standard diffusion backbones with minimal and targeted architectural modifications. Experiments demonstrate state of the art fidelity and cross-view consistency.

Motivation: 现有dMLLMs在推理时因全序列注意力计算而产生显著计算开销，现有优化方法大多忽视了模态特定的视觉令牌冗余问题。

Method: 通过全面研究不同dMLLM架构和任务中视觉令牌冗余的演变规律，以及视觉令牌剪枝对模型响应和效率的影响。

Result: 研究发现：视觉冗余仅出现在从头训练dMLLMs处理长答案任务时；视觉令牌剪枝会引入不可忽视的信息损失，但只有从头训练dMLLMs能在后期去噪步骤中逐步恢复丢失信息；层跳过适用于AR到扩散dMLLMs，而渐进或后期剪枝对从头训练dMLLMs更有效。

Conclusion: 这项工作为dMLLMs的效率优化提供了新视角，极大地推进了其在各种多模态理解任务中的适用性。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion-based multimodal large language models (dMLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive MLLMs thanks to their advantages in parallel decoding and bidirectional context modeling, but most existing dMLLMs incur significant computational overhead during inference due to the full-sequence attention computation in each denoising step. Pioneer studies attempt to resolve this issue from a modality-agnostic perspective via key-value cache optimization or efficient sampling but most of them overlook modality-specific visual token redundancy. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study on how visual token redundancy evolves with different dMLLM architectures and tasks and how visual token pruning affects dMLLM responses and efficiency. Specifically, our study reveals that visual redundancy emerges only in from-scratch dMLLMs while handling long-answer tasks. In addition, we validate that visual token pruning introduces non-negligible information loss in dMLLMs and only from-scratch dMLLMs can recover the lost information progressively during late denoising steps. Furthermore, our study shows that layer-skipping is promising for accelerating AR-to-diffusion dMLLMs, whereas progressive or late-step pruning is more effective for from-scratch dMLLMs. Overall, this work offers a new perspective on efficiency optimization for dMLLMs, greatly advancing their applicability across various multimodal understanding tasks.

Motivation: 现有3DGS方法在训练未见采样率下会出现侵蚀导致的模糊伪影（放大时）和扩张导致的阶梯伪影（缩小时），这些源于传统alpha混合的基本限制。

Method: 提出高斯混合方法，将alpha和透射率视为空间变化分布而非标量，考虑像素区域内alpha值的空间分布来更新透射率，使附近背景溅射能贡献最终渲染。

Result: 高斯混合能有效捕捉训练未见各种采样率的细节，在未见和已见采样率下均优于现有新视角合成模型。

Conclusion: 高斯混合作为即插即用方案，解决了3DGS的采样率相关伪影问题，保持实时渲染性能，可轻松集成到现有3DGS框架中。

Abstract: The recent introduction of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has significantly advanced novel view synthesis. Several studies have further improved the rendering quality of 3DGS, yet they still exhibit noticeable visual discrepancies when synthesizing views at sampling rates unseen during training. Specifically, they suffer from (i) erosion-induced blurring artifacts when zooming in and (ii) dilation-induced staircase artifacts when zooming out. We speculate that these artifacts arise from the fundamental limitation of the alpha blending adopted in 3DGS methods. Instead of the conventional alpha blending that computes alpha and transmittance as scalar quantities over a pixel, we propose to replace it with our novel Gaussian Blending that treats alpha and transmittance as spatially varying distributions. Thus, transmittances can be updated considering the spatial distribution of alpha values across the pixel area, allowing nearby background splats to contribute to the final rendering. Our Gaussian Blending maintains real-time rendering speed and requires no additional memory cost, while being easily integrated as a drop-in replacement into existing 3DGS-based or other NVS frameworks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Gaussian Blending effectively captures fine details at various sampling rates unseen during training, consistently outperforming existing novel view synthesis models across both unseen and seen sampling rates.

Conclusion: 提出的USD策略能够有效激活SAM的泛化能力，在少样本分割任务中实现无偏的语义解码。

Abstract: Few-shot segmentation has garnered significant attention. Many recent approaches attempt to introduce the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to handle this task. With the strong generalization ability and rich object-specific extraction ability of the SAM model, such a solution shows great potential in few-shot segmentation. However, the decoding process of SAM highly relies on accurate and explicit prompts, making previous approaches mainly focus on extracting prompts from the support set, which is insufficient to activate the generalization ability of SAM, and this design is easy to result in a biased decoding process when adapting to the unknown classes. In this work, we propose an Unbiased Semantic Decoding (USD) strategy integrated with SAM, which extracts target information from both the support and query set simultaneously to perform consistent predictions guided by the semantics of the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model. Specifically, to enhance the unbiased semantic discrimination of SAM, we design two feature enhancement strategies that leverage the semantic alignment capability of CLIP to enrich the original SAM features, mainly including a global supplement at the image level to provide a generalize category indicate with support image and a local guidance at the pixel level to provide a useful target location with query image. Besides, to generate target-focused prompt embeddings, a learnable visual-text target prompt generator is proposed by interacting target text embeddings and clip visual features. Without requiring re-training of the vision foundation models, the features with semantic discrimination draw attention to the target region through the guidance of prompt with rich target information.

Abstract: Active learning reduces annotation costs in medical imaging by strategically selecting the most informative samples for labeling. However, individual acquisition strategies often exhibit inconsistent behavior across different stages of the active learning cycle. We propose Cyclical and Performance-Adaptive Multi-Strategy Active Learning (WaveFuse-AL), a novel framework that adaptively fuses multiple established acquisition strategies-BALD, BADGE, Entropy, and CoreSet throughout the learning process. WaveFuse-AL integrates cyclical (sinusoidal) temporal priors with performance-driven adaptation to dynamically adjust strategy importance over time. We evaluate WaveFuse-AL on three medical imaging benchmarks: APTOS-2019 (multi-class classification), RSNA Pneumonia Detection (binary classification), and ISIC-2018 (skin lesion segmentation). Experimental results demonstrate that WaveFuse-AL consistently outperforms both single-strategy and alternating-strategy baselines, achieving statistically significant performance improvements (on ten out of twelve metric measurements) while maximizing the utility of limited annotation budgets.

Conclusion: 在大规模预训练网络时代，紧凑、任务特定的架构至关重要。

Abstract: High-dimensional neuroimaging analyses for clinical diagnosis are often constrained by compromises in spatiotemporal fidelity and by the limited adaptability of large-scale, general-purpose models. To address these challenges, we introduce Dynamic Curriculum Learning for Spatiotemporal Encoding (DCL-SE), an end-to-end framework centered on data-driven spatiotemporal encoding (DaSE). We leverage Approximate Rank Pooling (ARP) to efficiently encode three-dimensional volumetric brain data into information-rich, two-dimensional dynamic representations, and then employ a dynamic curriculum learning strategy, guided by a Dynamic Group Mechanism (DGM), to progressively train the decoder, refining feature extraction from global anatomical structures to fine pathological details. Evaluated across six publicly available datasets, including Alzheimer's disease and brain tumor classification, cerebral artery segmentation, and brain age prediction, DCL-SE consistently outperforms existing methods in accuracy, robustness, and interpretability. These findings underscore the critical importance of compact, task-specific architectures in the era of large-scale pretrained networks.

We present a structure-aware pipeline that learns a surgical action ontology from real trainer-to-trainee transcripts (33 surgeries) and uses it to condition feedback generation. We contribute by (1) mining Instrument-Action-Target (IAT) triplets from real-world feedback text and clustering surface forms into normalized categories, (2) fine-tuning a video-to-IAT model that leverages the surgical procedure and task contexts as well as fine-grained temporal instrument motion, and (3) demonstrating how to effectively use IAT triplet representations to guide GPT-4o in generating clinically grounded, trainer-style feedback. We show that, on Task 1: Video-to-IAT recognition, our context injection and temporal tracking deliver consistent AUC gains (Instrument: 0.67 to 0.74; Action: 0.60 to 0.63; Tissue: 0.74 to 0.79). For Task 2: feedback text generation (rated on a 1-5 fidelity rubric where 1 = opposite/unsafe, 3 = admissible, and 5 = perfect match to a human trainer), GPT-4o from video alone scores 2.17, while IAT conditioning reaches 2.44 (+12.4%), doubling the share of admissible generations with score >= 3 from 21% to 42%. Traditional text-similarity metrics also improve: word error rate decreases by 15-31% and ROUGE (phrase/substring overlap) increases by 9-64%. Grounding generation in explicit IAT structure improves fidelity and yields clinician-verifiable rationales, supporting auditable use in surgical training.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了SceneEdited数据集，这是首个专门用于支持通过3D点云更新进行高精地图维护研究的大规模城市数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高精地图对城市规划、基础设施监控和自动驾驶至关重要，但这些地图会随着环境变化而快速过时。现有技术虽然能检测变化，但在将2D图像变化检测结果转化为3D地图更新方面存在明显差距。

Conclusion: SceneEdited数据集和工具包为3D地图更新研究建立了标准化基准，支持未来数据集扩展和过时对象标注的统一。

Abstract: Accurate, up-to-date High-Definition (HD) maps are critical for urban planning, infrastructure monitoring, and autonomous navigation. However, these maps quickly become outdated as environments evolve, creating a need for robust methods that not only detect changes but also incorporate them into updated 3D representations. While change detection techniques have advanced significantly, there remains a clear gap between detecting changes and actually updating 3D maps, particularly when relying on 2D image-based change detection. To address this gap, we introduce SceneEdited, the first city-scale dataset explicitly designed to support research on HD map maintenance through 3D point cloud updating. SceneEdited contains over 800 up-to-date scenes covering 73 km of driving and approximate 3 $\text{km}^2$ of urban area, with more than 23,000 synthesized object changes created both manually and automatically across 2000+ out-of-date versions, simulating realistic urban modifications such as missing roadside infrastructure, buildings, overpasses, and utility poles. Each scene includes calibrated RGB images, LiDAR scans, and detailed change masks for training and evaluation. We also provide baseline methods using a foundational image-based structure-from-motion pipeline for updating outdated scenes, as well as a comprehensive toolkit supporting scalability, trackability, and portability for future dataset expansion and unification of out-of-date object annotations. Both the dataset and the toolkit are publicly available at https://github.com/ChadLin9596/ScenePoint-ETK, establising a standardized benchmark for 3D map updating research.

Conclusion: 该方法有效缓解了灾难性遗忘问题，同时保持了紧凑的架构，为多模态持续学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multimodal continual instruction tuning enables multimodal large language models to sequentially adapt to new tasks while building upon previously acquired knowledge. However, this continual learning paradigm faces the significant challenge of catastrophic forgetting, where learning new tasks leads to performance degradation on previous ones. In this paper, we introduce a novel insight into catastrophic forgetting by conceptualizing it as a problem of missing gradients from old tasks during new task learning. Our approach approximates these missing gradients by leveraging the geometric properties of the parameter space, specifically using the directional vector between current parameters and previously optimal parameters as gradient guidance. This approximated gradient can be further integrated with real gradients from a limited replay buffer and regulated by a Bernoulli sampling strategy that dynamically balances model stability and plasticity. Extensive experiments on multimodal continual instruction tuning datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance without model expansion, effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting while maintaining a compact architecture.

Abstract: Self-supervised depth estimation has gained significant attention in autonomous driving and robotics. However, existing methods exhibit substantial performance degradation under adverse weather conditions such as rain and fog, where reduced visibility critically impairs depth prediction. To address this issue, we propose a novel self-evolution contrastive learning framework called SEC-Depth for self-supervised robust depth estimation tasks. Our approach leverages intermediate parameters generated during training to construct temporally evolving latency models. Using these, we design a self-evolution contrastive scheme to mitigate performance loss under challenging conditions. Concretely, we first design a dynamic update strategy of latency models for the depth estimation task to capture optimization states across training stages. To effectively leverage latency models, we introduce a self-evolution contrastive Loss (SECL) that treats outputs from historical latency models as negative samples. This mechanism adaptively adjusts learning objectives while implicitly sensing weather degradation severity, reducing the needs for manual intervention. Experiments show that our method integrates seamlessly into diverse baseline models and significantly enhances robustness in zero-shot evaluations.

Abstract: Computer-Use Agents (CUA) are becoming increasingly capable of autonomously operating digital environments through Graphical User Interfaces (GUI). Yet, most GUI remain designed primarily for humans--prioritizing aesthetics and usability--forcing agents to adopt human-oriented behaviors that are unnecessary for efficient task execution. At the same time, rapid advances in coding-oriented language models (Coder) have transformed automatic GUI design. This raises a fundamental question: Can CUA as judges to assist Coder for automatic GUI design? To investigate, we introduce AUI-Gym, a benchmark for Automatic GUI development spanning 52 applications across diverse domains. Using language models, we synthesize 1560 tasks that simulate real-world scenarios. To ensure task reliability, we further develop a verifier that programmatically checks whether each task is executable within its environment. Building on this, we propose a Coder-CUA in Collaboration framework: the Coder acts as Designer, generating and revising websites, while the CUA serves as Judge, evaluating functionality and refining designs. Success is measured not by visual appearance, but by task solvability and CUA navigation success rate. To turn CUA feedback into usable guidance, we design a CUA Dashboard that compresses multi-step navigation histories into concise visual summaries, offering interpretable guidance for iterative redesign. By positioning agents as both designers and judges, our framework shifts interface design toward agent-native efficiency and reliability. Our work takes a step toward shifting agents from passive use toward active participation in digital environments. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/showlab/AUI.

Conclusion: MMCM是一种有效的多模态人体运动预测评估指标，能够同时考虑覆盖范围和运动有效性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel metric for Human Motion Prediction (HMP). Since a single past sequence can lead to multiple possible futures, a probabilistic HMP method predicts such multiple motions. While a single motion predicted by a deterministic method is evaluated only with the difference from its ground truth motion, multiple predicted motions should also be evaluated based on their distribution. For this evaluation, this paper focuses on the following two criteria. \textbf{(a) Coverage}: motions should be distributed among multiple motion modes to cover diverse possibilities. \textbf{(b) Validity}: motions should be kinematically valid as future motions observable from a given past motion. However, existing metrics simply appreciate widely distributed motions even if these motions are observed in a single mode and kinematically invalid. To resolve these disadvantages, this paper proposes a Multimodality-aware Metric using Clustering-based Modes (MMCM). For (a) coverage, MMCM divides a motion space into several clusters, each of which is regarded as a mode. These modes are used to explicitly evaluate whether predicted motions are distributed among multiple modes. For (b) validity, MMCM identifies valid modes by collecting possible future motions from a motion dataset. Our experiments validate that our clustering yields sensible mode definitions and that MMCM accurately scores multimodal predictions. Code: https://github.com/placerkyo/MMCM

Motivation: 尽管测试时思考在大型视觉语言模型中显示出性能提升，但缺乏对思考如何影响视觉推理的系统性分析。本研究旨在填补这一空白，深入理解思考机制在视觉推理中的作用。

Method: 对InternVL3.5和Qwen3-VL家族的10个变体进行大规模对比分析，在MMMU-val上评估不同思考方式。提出了不确定性引导回看方法，结合不确定性信号、自适应回看提示和广度搜索。

Result: 研究发现长推理链往往产生忽略图像的错误轨迹，表现不如标准指令模式。短回看短语与成功的推理轨迹强相关。提出的方法在MMMU上提升了整体性能，在标准思考薄弱的类别中取得最大增益，并在5个额外基准测试中表现一致。

Conclusion: 测试时思考需要谨慎设计，简单的长推理链可能适得其反。不确定性引导回看解码策略能有效提升视觉推理性能，为视觉语言模型的推理机制提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Test-time thinking (that is, generating explicit intermediate reasoning chains) is known to boost performance in large language models and has recently shown strong gains for large vision language models (LVLMs). However, despite these promising results, there is still no systematic analysis of how thinking actually affects visual reasoning. We provide the first such analysis with a large scale, controlled comparison of thinking for LVLMs, evaluating ten variants from the InternVL3.5 and Qwen3-VL families on MMMU-val under generous token budgets and multi pass decoding. We show that more thinking is not always better; long chains often yield long wrong trajectories that ignore the image and underperform the same models run in standard instruct mode. A deeper analysis reveals that certain short lookback phrases, which explicitly refer back to the image, are strongly enriched in successful trajectories and correlate with better visual grounding. Building on this insight, we propose uncertainty guided lookback, a training free decoding strategy that combines an uncertainty signal with adaptive lookback prompts and breadth search. Our method improves overall MMMU performance, delivers the largest gains in categories where standard thinking is weak, and outperforms several strong decoding baselines, setting a new state of the art under fixed model families and token budgets. We further show that this decoding strategy generalizes, yielding consistent improvements on five additional benchmarks, including two broad multimodal suites and math focused visual reasoning datasets.

Conclusion: 指令引导病灶分割新范式可行且有效，MIMIC-ILS数据集和ROSALIA模型为胸部X光病灶分析提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The applicability of current lesion segmentation models for chest X-rays (CXRs) has been limited both by a small number of target labels and the reliance on long, detailed expert-level text inputs, creating a barrier to practical use. To address these limitations, we introduce a new paradigm: instruction-guided lesion segmentation (ILS), which is designed to segment diverse lesion types based on simple, user-friendly instructions. Under this paradigm, we construct MIMIC-ILS, the first large-scale instruction-answer dataset for CXR lesion segmentation, using our fully automated multimodal pipeline that generates annotations from chest X-ray images and their corresponding reports. MIMIC-ILS contains 1.1M instruction-answer pairs derived from 192K images and 91K unique segmentation masks, covering seven major lesion types. To empirically demonstrate its utility, we introduce ROSALIA, a vision-language model fine-tuned on MIMIC-ILS. ROSALIA can segment diverse lesions and provide textual explanations in response to user instructions. The model achieves high segmentation and textual accuracy in our newly proposed task, highlighting the effectiveness of our pipeline and the value of MIMIC-ILS as a foundational resource for pixel-level CXR lesion grounding.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a principled framework for improving Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. However, existing RL approaches often rely on human-annotated labels or task-specific heuristics to define verifiable rewards, both of which are costly and difficult to scale. We introduce VisPlay, a self-evolving RL framework that enables VLMs to autonomously improve their reasoning abilities using large amounts of unlabeled image data. Starting from a single base VLM, VisPlay assigns the model into two interacting roles: an Image-Conditioned Questioner that formulates challenging yet answerable visual questions, and a Multimodal Reasoner that generates silver responses. These roles are jointly trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which incorporates diversity and difficulty rewards to balance the complexity of generated questions with the quality of the silver answers. VisPlay scales efficiently across two model families. When trained on Qwen2.5-VL and MiMo-VL, VisPlay achieves consistent improvements in visual reasoning, compositional generalization, and hallucination reduction across eight benchmarks, including MM-Vet and MMMU, demonstrating a scalable path toward self-evolving multimodal intelligence.

Abstract: Accurate brain age estimation from structural MRI is a valuable biomarker for studying aging and neurodegeneration. Traditional regression and CNN-based methods face limitations such as manual feature engineering, limited receptive fields, and overfitting on heterogeneous data. Pure transformer models, while effective, require large datasets and high computational cost. We propose Brain ResNet over trained Vision Transformer (BrainRotViT), a hybrid architecture that combines the global context modeling of vision transformers (ViT) with the local refinement of residual CNNs. A ViT encoder is first trained on an auxiliary age and sex classification task to learn slice-level features. The frozen encoder is then applied to all sagittal slices to generate a 2D matrix of embedding vectors, which is fed into a residual CNN regressor that incorporates subject sex at the final fully-connected layer to estimate continuous brain age. Our method achieves an MAE of 3.34 years (Pearson $r=0.98$, Spearman $ρ=0.97$, $R^2=0.95$) on validation across 11 MRI datasets encompassing more than 130 acquisition sites, outperforming baseline and state-of-the-art models. It also generalizes well across 4 independent cohorts with MAEs between 3.77 and 5.04 years. Analyses on the brain age gap (the difference between the predicted age and actual age) show that aging patterns are associated with Alzheimer's disease, cognitive impairment, and autism spectrum disorder. Model attention maps highlight aging-associated regions of the brain, notably the cerebellar vermis, precentral and postcentral gyri, temporal lobes, and medial superior frontal gyrus. Our results demonstrate that this method provides an efficient, interpretable, and generalizable framework for brain-age prediction, bridging the gap between CNN- and transformer-based approaches while opening new avenues for aging and neurodegeneration research.

Result: 在3个模型系列和13个基准测试中，MoDES显著优于现有方法。当跳过88%专家时，性能提升达10.67%，推理速度提升2.16倍（预填充）和1.26倍（解码）。

Conclusion: MoDES是首个无需训练的高效MoE多模态大语言模型推理框架，能有效平衡模型性能和推理效率，为实际部署提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at vision-language tasks, but they suffer from high computational inefficiency. To reduce inference overhead, expert skipping methods have been proposed to deactivate redundant experts based on the current input tokens. However, we find that applying these methods-originally designed for unimodal large language models (LLMs)-to MLLMs results in considerable performance degradation. This is primarily because such methods fail to account for the heterogeneous contributions of experts across MoE layers and modality-specific behaviors of tokens within these layers. Motivated by these findings, we propose MoDES, the first training-free framework that adaptively skips experts to enable efficient and accurate MoE MLLM inference. It incorporates a globally-modulated local gating (GMLG) mechanism that integrates global layer-wise importance into local routing probabilities to accurately estimate per-token expert importance. A dual-modality thresholding (DMT) method is then applied, which processes tokens from each modality separately, to derive the skipping schedule. To set the optimal thresholds, we introduce a frontier search algorithm that exploits monotonicity properties, cutting convergence time from several days to a few hours. Extensive experiments for 3 model series across 13 benchmarks demonstrate that MoDES far outperforms previous approaches. For instance, when skipping 88% experts for Qwen3-VL-MoE-30B-A3B-Instruct, the performance boost is up to 10.67% (97.33% vs. 86.66%). Furthermore, MoDES significantly enhances inference speed, improving the prefilling time by 2.16$\times$ and the decoding time by 1.26$\times$.

Abstract: Reference-based object composition methods fail when inserting real-world objects into stylized domains. This under-explored problem is currently split between practical "blenders" that lack generative fidelity and "generators" that require impractical, per-subject online finetuning. In this work, we introduce Insert In Style, the first zero-shot generative framework that is both practical and high-fidelity. Our core contribution is a unified framework with two key innovations: (i) a novel multi-stage training protocol that disentangles representations for identity, style, and composition, and (ii) a specialized masked-attention architecture that surgically enforces this disentanglement during generation. This approach prevents the concept interference common in general-purpose, unified-attention models. Our framework is trained on a new 100k sample dataset, curated from a novel data pipeline. This pipeline couples large-scale generation with a rigorous, two-stage filtering process to ensure both high-fidelity semantic identity and style coherence. Unlike prior work, our model is truly zero-shot and requires no text prompts. We also introduce a new public benchmark for stylized composition. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods on both identity and style metrics, a result strongly corroborated by user studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大模型在从少量示例中推断结构化转换规则方面仍然失败，而人类在解决此类谜题时严重依赖视觉抽象。作者发现单纯将ARC-AGI网格渲染为图像会因规则执行不精确而降低性能，因此假设视觉和语言在不同推理阶段具有互补优势。

Method: 提出了两种协同策略：(1) 视觉-语言协同推理(VLSR)，将ARC-AGI分解为模态对齐的子任务；(2) 模态切换自校正(MSSC)，利用视觉验证基于文本的推理以实现内在错误校正。

Result: 实验表明该方法在多个旗舰模型和ARC-AGI任务上比纯文本基线提高了4.33%的性能。

Conclusion: 将视觉抽象与语言推理统一是实现未来基础模型中可泛化、类人智能的关键步骤。

Abstract: Abstract reasoning from minimal examples remains a core unsolved problem for frontier foundation models such as GPT-5 and Grok 4. These models still fail to infer structured transformation rules from a handful of examples, which is a key hallmark of human intelligence. The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) provides a rigorous testbed for this capability, demanding conceptual rule induction and transfer to novel tasks. Most existing methods treat ARC-AGI as a purely textual reasoning task, overlooking the fact that humans rely heavily on visual abstraction when solving such puzzles. However, our pilot experiments reveal a paradox: naively rendering ARC-AGI grids as images degrades performance due to imprecise rule execution. This leads to our central hypothesis that vision and language possess complementary strengths across distinct reasoning stages: vision supports global pattern abstraction and verification, whereas language specializes in symbolic rule formulation and precise execution. Building on this insight, we introduce two synergistic strategies: (1) Vision-Language Synergy Reasoning (VLSR), which decomposes ARC-AGI into modality-aligned subtasks; and (2) Modality-Switch Self-Correction (MSSC), which leverages vision to verify text-based reasoning for intrinsic error correction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach yields up to a 4.33% improvement over text-only baselines across diverse flagship models and multiple ARC-AGI tasks. Our findings suggest that unifying visual abstraction with linguistic reasoning is a crucial step toward achieving generalizable, human-like intelligence in future foundation models. Source code will be released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标如BLEU、CIDEr、VQA等在领域特定或上下文依赖场景中难以准确捕捉语义或结构准确性。

Method: 三阶段架构：(1)通过目标检测和视觉语言模型提取多模态特征；(2)置信度加权组件融合进行自适应组件级验证；(3)使用大语言模型进行物理引导推理，强制执行结构和关系约束。

Result: 未在摘要中明确说明具体实验结果。

Conclusion: PCMDE指标通过结合多模态特征提取、自适应融合和物理约束推理，能够更好地评估语义和结构准确性。

Abstract: Current state of the art measures like BLEU, CIDEr, VQA score, SigLIP-2 and CLIPScore are often unable to capture semantic or structural accuracy, especially for domain-specific or context-dependent scenarios. For this, this paper proposes a Physics-Constrained Multimodal Data Evaluation (PCMDE) metric combining large language models with reasoning, knowledge based mapping and vision-language models to overcome these limitations. The architecture is comprised of three main stages: (1) feature extraction of spatial and semantic information with multimodal features through object detection and VLMs; (2) Confidence-Weighted Component Fusion for adaptive component-level validation; and (3) physics-guided reasoning using large language models for structural and relational constraints (e.g., alignment, position, consistency) enforcement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够进行可验证、逐步推理的皮肤病诊断AI模型，提高诊断过程的透明度和准确性。

Method: 构建DermCoT语料库（包含10,000个训练案例和3,000个认证案例），定义DermEval六维评估器和DermBench基准，结合皮肤病感知的视觉蒸馏技术。

Result: 在DermBench上获得4.031/5的平均分，排名第一；在三个皮肤病分类基准上表现稳定且具有竞争力；消融实验显示DermCoT监督和视觉蒸馏均带来显著改进。

Conclusion: SkinGPT-R1通过链式思维推理和皮肤病特定训练，在皮肤病诊断质量和准确性方面实现了显著提升，为临床AI应用提供了可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: We present SkinGPT-R1, a dermatology focused vision language model that makes diagnostic chain of thought reasoning explicit, step by step, and verifiable. To support skin specific reasoning, we build DermCoT, a corpus of standardized dermatologic chain of thought narratives that combines 10,000 DermEval filtered training cases with 3,000 dermatologist scored certified cases, and we define DermEval as a physician aligned six dimensional evaluator and DermBench as the corresponding benchmark for dermatologic chain of thought quality. On DermBench, across 14 general, reasoning, and medical vision language models, SkinGPT-R1 achieves an average score of 4.031 out of 5 over the six clinician defined dimensions, ranks 1st among all systems, and improves the average score over Vision-R1 by about 41%. On three dermatology classification benchmarks, SkinGPT-R1 delivers stable accuracy gains over Vision-R1 and remains competitive among strong vision language models. Ablation results further show that DermCoT based chain of thought supervision provides substantial improvements over the base model and that adding dermatology aware visual distillation yields consistent additional gains in both narrative quality and recognition.

*Yitong Yang,Yinglin Wang,Changshuo Wang,Yongjun Zhang,Ziyang Chen,Shuting He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SplitFlux是一种基于Flux模型的内容-风格解耦方法，通过分析Flux模型的特性，发现早期单流块控制内容、后期块控制风格，并采用LoRA微调和视觉门控机制实现高质量的内容保留和风格化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SDXL方法难以实现高质量的内容-风格解耦，而新提出的Flux模型由于特性未被充分探索，无法有效分离内容和风格。

Method: 1) 通过LoRA微调单梦块；2) 秩约束适应：压缩特定块的秩并放大更新幅度，防止内容泄漏到风格块；3) 视觉门控LoRA：将内容LoRA分为高秩和低秩分支，分别保留主体信息和残差细节。

Result: 在多样化场景中，SplitFlux在内容保留和风格化质量方面持续优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SplitFlux通过系统分析Flux模型特性并提出创新的解耦机制，成功实现了高质量的内容-风格分离和重新嵌入。

Abstract: Disentangling image content and style is essential for customized image generation. Existing SDXL-based methods struggle to achieve high-quality results, while the recently proposed Flux model fails to achieve effective content-style separation due to its underexplored characteristics. To address these challenges, we conduct a systematic analysis of Flux and make two key observations: (1) Single Dream Blocks are essential for image generation; and (2) Early single stream blocks mainly control content, whereas later blocks govern style. Based on these insights, we propose SplitFlux, which disentangles content and style by fine-tuning the single dream blocks via LoRA, enabling the disentangled content to be re-embedded into new contexts. It includes two key components: (1) Rank-Constrained Adaptation. To preserve content identity and structure, we compress the rank and amplify the magnitude of updates within specific blocks, preventing content leakage into style blocks. (2) Visual-Gated LoRA. We split the content LoRA into two branches with different ranks, guided by image saliency. The high-rank branch preserves primary subject information, while the low-rank branch encodes residual details, mitigating content overfitting and enabling seamless re-embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SplitFlux consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior content preservation and stylization quality across diverse scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Graph Query Networks (GQN)框架，使用图查询在BEV空间中动态构建对象特定图，通过EdgeFocus和DeepContext Pooling模块处理雷达数据，显著提升3D雷达目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D雷达检测对360度汽车感知至关重要，但雷达的长波长产生稀疏不规则反射，挑战传统基于网格和序列的卷积和变换器检测器。

Method: GQN将雷达感知对象建模为图，使用图查询动态关注BEV空间，构建对象特定图，通过EdgeFocus进行关系推理，DeepContext Pooling进行上下文聚合。

Result: 在NuScenes数据集上，GQN相对mAP提升高达+53%，比最强雷达方法提升+8.2%，同时将峰值图构建开销降低80%，FLOPs成本适中。

Conclusion: GQN框架有效解决了雷达数据稀疏不规则的问题，显著提升了3D雷达目标检测性能，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Object detection with 3D radar is essential for 360-degree automotive perception, but radar's long wavelengths produce sparse and irregular reflections that challenge traditional grid and sequence-based convolutional and transformer detectors. This paper introduces Graph Query Networks (GQN), an attention-based framework that models objects sensed by radar as graphs, to extract individualized relational and contextual features. GQN employs a novel concept of graph queries to dynamically attend over the bird's-eye view (BEV) space, constructing object-specific graphs processed by two novel modules: EdgeFocus for relational reasoning and DeepContext Pooling for contextual aggregation. On the NuScenes dataset, GQN improves relative mAP by up to +53%, including a +8.2% gain over the strongest prior radar method, while reducing peak graph construction overhead by 80% with moderate FLOPs cost.

TL;DR: 提出LEO框架，通过边到对象的推理范式解决3D场景图预测中高阶关系依赖捕获不足的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法采用以对象为中心的图神经网络，关系边特征通过聚合相连对象节点的信息来迭代更新，但这种设计将关系表示限制在成对对象上下文中，难以捕捉对准确关系预测至关重要的高阶关系依赖

Method: LEO框架：1) 预测对象对之间的潜在链接以抑制无关边；2) 将原始场景图转换为线图，将每个关系视为节点；3) 应用线图神经网络进行以边为中心的关系推理以捕捉关系间上下文；4) 将丰富的关系特征整合回原始对象中心图以增强对象级推理

Result: 在3DSSG数据集上与两个竞争基线相比显示出一致的改进

Conclusion: LEO框架是模型无关的，可以与任何现有的以对象为中心的方法集成，边到对象推理范式的有效性得到了验证

Abstract: 3D scene graph prediction aims to abstract complex 3D environments into structured graphs consisting of objects and their pairwise relationships. Existing approaches typically adopt object-centric graph neural networks, where relation edge features are iteratively updated by aggregating messages from connected object nodes. However, this design inherently restricts relation representations to pairwise object context, making it difficult to capture high-order relational dependencies that are essential for accurate relation prediction. To address this limitation, we propose a Link-guided Edge-centric relational reasoning framework with Object-aware fusion, namely LEO, which enables progressive reasoning from relation-level context to object-level understanding. Specifically, LEO first predicts potential links between object pairs to suppress irrelevant edges, and then transforms the original scene graph into a line graph where each relation is treated as a node. A line graph neural network is applied to perform edge-centric relational reasoning to capture inter-relation context. The enriched relation features are subsequently integrated into the original object-centric graph to enhance object-level reasoning and improve relation prediction. Our framework is model-agnostic and can be integrated with any existing object-centric method. Experiments on the 3DSSG dataset with two competitive baselines show consistent improvements, highlighting the effectiveness of our edge-to-object reasoning paradigm.

Conclusion: Xsyn是首个无需额外人工成本即可实现高质量X射线安检图像合成的方法，在检测性能提升方面表现出色。

Abstract: Training prohibited item detection models requires a large amount of X-ray security images, but collecting and annotating these images is time-consuming and laborious. To address data insufficiency, X-ray security image synthesis methods composite images to scale up datasets. However, previous methods primarily follow a two-stage pipeline, where they implement labor-intensive foreground extraction in the first stage and then composite images in the second stage. Such a pipeline introduces inevitable extra labor cost and is not efficient. In this paper, we propose a one-stage X-ray security image synthesis pipeline (Xsyn) based on text-to-image generation, which incorporates two effective strategies to improve the usability of synthetic images. The Cross-Attention Refinement (CAR) strategy leverages the cross-attention map from the diffusion model to refine the bounding box annotation. The Background Occlusion Modeling (BOM) strategy explicitly models background occlusion in the latent space to enhance imaging complexity. To the best of our knowledge, compared with previous methods, Xsyn is the first to achieve high-quality X-ray security image synthesis without extra labor cost. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms all previous methods with 1.2% mAP improvement, and the synthetic images generated by our method are beneficial to improve prohibited item detection performance across various X-ray security datasets and detectors.

Conclusion: Text2Loc++通过创新的跨模态对齐方法和从粗到精的定位框架，在3D点云语言定位任务中取得了显著性能提升和良好泛化能力。

Abstract: We tackle the problem of localizing 3D point cloud submaps using complex and diverse natural language descriptions, and present Text2Loc++, a novel neural network designed for effective cross-modal alignment between language and point clouds in a coarse-to-fine localization pipeline. To support benchmarking, we introduce a new city-scale dataset covering both color and non-color point clouds from diverse urban scenes, and organize location descriptions into three levels of linguistic complexity. In the global place recognition stage, Text2Loc++ combines a pretrained language model with a Hierarchical Transformer with Max pooling (HTM) for sentence-level semantics, and employs an attention-based point cloud encoder for spatial understanding. We further propose Masked Instance Training (MIT) to filter out non-aligned objects and improve multimodal robustness. To enhance the embedding space, we introduce Modality-aware Hierarchical Contrastive Learning (MHCL), incorporating cross-modal, submap-, text-, and instance-level losses. In the fine localization stage, we completely remove explicit text-instance matching and design a lightweight yet powerful framework based on Prototype-based Map Cloning (PMC) and a Cascaded Cross-Attention Transformer (CCAT). Extensive experiments on the KITTI360Pose dataset show that Text2Loc++ outperforms existing methods by up to 15%. In addition, the proposed model exhibits robust generalization when evaluated on the new dataset, effectively handling complex linguistic expressions and a wide variety of urban environments. The code and dataset will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D视觉语言基础模型在开放世界点云处理中表现出色，但在实际应用中面对噪声、不完整或分布偏移数据时性能下降，需要有效的自适应方法。

Conclusion: Uni-Adapter无需重新训练即可有效缓解分布偏移，为3D视觉语言基础模型提供了可靠的测试时自适应解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Vision-Language Foundation Models (VLFMs) have shown strong generalization and zero-shot recognition capabilities in open-world point cloud processing tasks. However, these models often underperform in practical scenarios where data are noisy, incomplete, or drawn from a different distribution than the training data. To address this, we propose Uni-Adapter, a novel training-free online test-time adaptation (TTA) strategy for 3D VLFMs based on dynamic prototype learning. We define a 3D cache to store class-specific cluster centers as prototypes, which are continuously updated to capture intra-class variability in heterogeneous data distributions. These dynamic prototypes serve as anchors for cache-based logit computation via similarity scoring. Simultaneously, a graph-based label smoothing module captures inter-prototype similarities to enforce label consistency among similar prototypes. Finally, we unify predictions from the original 3D VLFM and the refined 3D cache using entropy-weighted aggregation for reliable adaptation. Without retraining, Uni-Adapter effectively mitigates distribution shifts, achieving state-of-the-art performance on diverse 3D benchmarks over different 3D VLFMs, improving ModelNet-40C by 10.55%, ScanObjectNN-C by 8.26%, and ShapeNet-C by 4.49% over the source 3D VLFMs.

TL;DR: FIA-Flow是一个黑盒特征反演攻击框架，能够从中间特征实现高保真图像重建，揭示了Split DNNs中比之前认知更严重的隐私威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Split DNNs通过将密集计算卸载到云服务器来赋能边缘设备，但这种范式暴露了隐私漏洞，因为中间特征可能被利用来通过特征反演攻击重建私有输入。现有FIA方法的重建质量有限，难以评估隐私泄露的真实程度。

Method: 设计了潜在特征空间对齐模块(LFSAM)来弥合中间特征空间和潜在空间之间的语义差距；开发了确定性反演流匹配(DIFM)来将离流形特征投影到目标流形上；提出了基于大型视觉语言模型的两种量化隐私泄露指标。

Result: 实验表明FIA-Flow在各种模型(AlexNet、ResNet、Swin Transformer、DINO和YOLO11)和层上实现了更忠实和语义对齐的特征反演。

Conclusion: FIA-Flow揭示了Split DNNs中比之前认知更严重的隐私威胁，为评估和缓解此类系统的隐私风险提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Split DNNs enable edge devices by offloading intensive computation to a cloud server, but this paradigm exposes privacy vulnerabilities, as the intermediate features can be exploited to reconstruct the private inputs via Feature Inversion Attack (FIA). Existing FIA methods often produce limited reconstruction quality, making it difficult to assess the true extent of privacy leakage. To reveal the privacy risk of the leaked features, we introduce FIA-Flow, a black-box FIA framework that achieves high-fidelity image reconstruction from intermediate features. To exploit the semantic information within intermediate features, we design a Latent Feature Space Alignment Module (LFSAM) to bridge the semantic gap between the intermediate feature space and the latent space. Furthermore, to rectify distributional mismatch, we develop Deterministic Inversion Flow Matching (DIFM), which projects off-manifold features onto the target manifold with one-step inference. This decoupled design simplifies learning and enables effective training with few image-feature pairs. To quantify privacy leakage from a human perspective, we also propose two metrics based on a large vision-language model. Experiments show that FIA-Flow achieves more faithful and semantically aligned feature inversion across various models (AlexNet, ResNet, Swin Transformer, DINO, and YOLO11) and layers, revealing a more severe privacy threat in Split DNNs than previously recognized.

Abstract: Fingerprint liveness detection systems have been affected by spoofing, which is a severe threat for fingerprint-based biometric systems. Therefore, it is crucial to develop some techniques to distinguish the fake fingerprints from the real ones. The software based techniques can detect the fingerprint forgery automatically. Also, the scheme shall be resistant against various distortions such as noise contamination, pixel missing and block missing, so that the forgers cannot deceive the detector by adding some distortions to the faked fingerprint. In this paper, we propose a fingerprint forgery detection algorithm based on a suggested adaptive thresholding pattern. The anisotropic diffusion of the input image is passed through three levels of the wavelet transform. The coefficients of different layers are adaptively thresholded and concatenated to produce the feature vector which is classified using the SVM classifier. Another contribution of the paper is to investigate the effect of various distortions such as pixel missing, block missing, and noise contamination. Our suggested approach includes a novel method that exhibits improved resistance against a range of distortions caused by environmental phenomena or manipulations by malicious users. In quantitative comparisons, our proposed method outperforms its counterparts by approximately 8% and 5% in accuracy for missing pixel scenarios of 90% and block missing scenarios of size 70x70 , respectively. This highlights the novelty approach in addressing such challenges.

Conclusion: 该方法超越了基于阈值的基线方法，为安全无人机导航提供了关键能力，能够主动避开未知物体并安全忽略背景区域。

Abstract: Developing reliable UAV navigation systems requires robust air-to-air object detectors capable of distinguishing between objects seen during training and previously unseen objects. While many methods address closed-set detection and achieve high-confidence recognition of in-domain (ID) targets, they generally do not tackle open-set detection, which requires simultaneous handling of both ID and out-of-distribution (OOD) objects. Existing open-set approaches typically rely on a single uncertainty score with thresholding, limiting flexibility and often conflating OOD objects with background clutter. In contrast, we propose a lightweight, model-agnostic post-processing framework that explicitly separates background from unknown objects while preserving the base detector's performance. Our approach extends open-set detection beyond binary ID/OOD classification to real-time three-way classification among ID targets, OOD objects, and background. To this end, we employ a fusion scheme that aggregates multiple confidence estimates and per-detection features using a compact multilayer perceptron (MLP). Incorporating different logit variants into the MLP consistently enhances performance across both binary and three-class classification without compromising throughput. Extensive ablation and comparative experiments confirm that our method surpasses threshold-based baselines in two-class classification by an average of 2.7% AUROC, while retaining or improving open-set mAP. Furthermore, our study uniquely enables robust three-class classification, a critical capability for safe UAV navigation, where OOD objects must be actively avoided and background regions safely ignored. Comparative analysis highlights that our method surpasses competitive techniques in AUROC across datasets, while improving closed-set mAP by up to 9 points, an 18% relative gain.

Conclusion: IPTQ-ViT首次实现了无需重新训练的全整数视觉变换器量化，在精度和延迟方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Previous Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) methods for vision transformers rely on expensive retraining to recover accuracy loss in non-linear layer quantization, limiting their use in resource-constrained environments. In contrast, existing Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) methods either partially quantize non-linear functions or adjust activation distributions to maintain accuracy but fail to achieve fully integer-only inference. In this paper, we introduce IPTQ-ViT, a novel PTQ framework for fully integer-only vision transformers without retraining. We present approximation functions: a polynomial-based GELU optimized for vision data and a bit-shifting-based Softmax designed to improve approximation accuracy in PTQ. In addition, we propose a unified metric integrating quantization sensitivity, perturbation, and computational cost to select the optimal approximation function per activation layer. IPTQ-ViT outperforms previous PTQ methods, achieving up to 6.44\%p (avg. 1.78\%p) top-1 accuracy improvement for image classification, 1.0 mAP for object detection. IPTQ-ViT outperforms partial floating-point PTQ methods under W8A8 and W4A8, and achieves accuracy and latency comparable to integer-only QAT methods. We plan to release our code https://github.com/gihwan-kim/IPTQ-ViT.git.

Abstract: Understanding complex human activities demands the ability to decompose motion into fine-grained, semantic-aligned sub-actions. This motion grounding process is crucial for behavior analysis, embodied AI and virtual reality. Yet, most existing methods rely on dense supervision with predefined action classes, which are infeasible in open-vocabulary, real-world settings. In this paper, we propose ZOMG, a zero-shot, open-vocabulary framework that segments motion sequences into semantically meaningful sub-actions without requiring any annotations or fine-tuning. Technically, ZOMG integrates (1) language semantic partition, which leverages large language models to decompose instructions into ordered sub-action units, and (2) soft masking optimization, which learns instance-specific temporal masks to focus on frames critical to sub-actions, while maintaining intra-segment continuity and enforcing inter-segment separation, all without altering the pretrained encoder. Experiments on three motion-language datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art effectiveness and efficiency of motion grounding performance, outperforming prior methods by +8.7\% mAP on HumanML3D benchmark. Meanwhile, significant improvements also exist in downstream retrieval, establishing a new paradigm for annotation-free motion understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoPrune是一种新颖的LLM修剪方法，通过让LLM自动设计修剪算法来克服传统方法需要专家知识的限制，并解决了高修剪率下的异常值问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM修剪方法严重依赖人工设计的修剪算法，导致巨大的人工成本和专家知识需求，且在高修剪率下存在严重的异常值问题导致性能急剧下降。

Method: 提出AutoPrune方法：1）利用LLM自动设计最优修剪算法；2）使用图驱动的思维链(GCoT)优化提示，增强推理过程；3）引入偏斜感知动态稀疏分配(SDSA)解决异常值问题。

Result: 在主流LLM基准测试上的广泛实验表明，AutoPrune始终优于最先进的竞争对手方法。

Conclusion: AutoPrune证明了LLM能够自我修剪，克服了专家知识限制和异常值问题，为LLM的实际部署提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on a wide range of tasks, hindering real-world deployment due to their massive size. Existing pruning methods (e.g., Wanda) tailored for LLMs rely heavily on manual design pruning algorithms, thereby leading to \textit{huge labor costs} and \textit{requires expert knowledge}. Furthermore, we are the first to identify the serious \textit{outlier value issue} behind dramatic performance degradation under high pruning ratios that are caused by uniform sparsity, raising an additional concern about how to design adaptive pruning sparsity ideal for LLMs. Can LLMs prune by themselves? In this work, we introduce an affirmative answer by proposing a novel pruning method called \textbf{AutoPrune}, which first overcomes expert knowledge limits by leveraging LLMs to design optimal pruning algorithms for themselves automatically without any expert knowledge. Specifically, to mitigate the black-box nature of LLMs, we propose a Graph-driven Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) to optimize prompts, significantly enhancing the reasoning process in learning the pruning algorithm and enabling us to generate pruning algorithms with superior performance and interpretability in the next generation. Finally, grounded in insights of outlier value issue, we introduce Skew-aware Dynamic Sparsity Allocation (SDSA) to overcome the outlier value issue, mitigating performance degradation under high pruning ratios. We conduct extensive experiments on mainstream LLMs benchmarks, demonstrating the superiority of AutoPrune, which consistently excels state-of-the-art competitors.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ShelfOcc是一种仅使用视觉的3D占用估计方法，通过从视频生成度量一致的语义体素标签，实现真正的3D监督，无需额外传感器或手动3D标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自监督和弱监督占用估计方法依赖2D投影或渲染监督，存在几何不一致和深度渗漏问题。需要克服这些限制，同时不依赖LiDAR。

Method: 引入专用框架，通过跨帧一致地过滤和累积静态几何，处理动态内容，并将语义信息传播到稳定的体素表示中。

Result: 在Occ3D-nuScenes基准测试中，ShelfOcc显著优于所有先前的弱监督/半监督方法（相对改进高达34%）。

Conclusion: 高质量监督对于稳健的占用学习至关重要，这构成了架构创新之外的重要补充途径，为无LiDAR的3D场景理解开辟了新的数据驱动方向。

Abstract: Recent progress in self- and weakly supervised occupancy estimation has largely relied on 2D projection or rendering-based supervision, which suffers from geometric inconsistencies and severe depth bleeding. We thus introduce ShelfOcc, a vision-only method that overcomes these limitations without relying on LiDAR. ShelfOcc brings supervision into native 3D space by generating metrically consistent semantic voxel labels from video, enabling true 3D supervision without any additional sensors or manual 3D annotations. While recent vision-based 3D geometry foundation models provide a promising source of prior knowledge, they do not work out of the box as a prediction due to sparse or noisy and inconsistent geometry, especially in dynamic driving scenes. Our method introduces a dedicated framework that mitigates these issues by filtering and accumulating static geometry consistently across frames, handling dynamic content and propagating semantic information into a stable voxel representation. This data-centric shift in supervision for weakly/shelf-supervised occupancy estimation allows the use of essentially any SOTA occupancy model architecture without relying on LiDAR data. We argue that such high-quality supervision is essential for robust occupancy learning and constitutes an important complementary avenue to architectural innovation. On the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark, ShelfOcc substantially outperforms all previous weakly/shelf-supervised methods (up to a 34% relative improvement), establishing a new data-driven direction for LiDAR-free 3D scene understanding.

TL;DR: 提出一种后处理框架，通过保形预测构建置信掩码，在图像级别控制假阳性预测，为语义分割提供统计保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度模型很少提供明确的统计误差保证，而可靠的语义分割对临床决策至关重要。需要一种方法能控制假阳性预测的风险。

Method: 使用预训练分割模型，通过增加分数阈值或形态学腐蚀构建收缩掩码族，利用标记校准集通过保形预测选择收缩参数。

Result: 在息肉分割基准测试中展示了目标级别的经验有效性，确保新图像中假阳性比例低于用户指定容差。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了实用的风险感知分割，在过分割可能产生临床后果的场景中特别有价值。

Abstract: Reliable semantic segmentation is essential for clinical decision making, yet deep models rarely provide explicit statistical guarantees on their errors. We introduce a simple post-hoc framework that constructs confidence masks with distribution-free, image-level control of false-positive predictions. Given any pretrained segmentation model, we define a nested family of shrunken masks obtained either by increasing the score threshold or by applying morphological erosion. A labeled calibration set is used to select a single shrink parameter via conformal prediction, ensuring that, for new images that are exchangeable with the calibration data, the proportion of false positives retained in the confidence mask stays below a user-specified tolerance with high probability. The method is model-agnostic, requires no retraining, and provides finite-sample guarantees regardless of the underlying predictor. Experiments on a polyp-segmentation benchmark demonstrate target-level empirical validity. Our framework enables practical, risk-aware segmentation in settings where over-segmentation can have clinical consequences. Code at https://github.com/deel-ai-papers/conseco.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D4C是首个专门为CLIP模型设计的数据无关量化框架，通过语义注入、结构对比生成和扰动增强三个组件，解决了现有DFQ方法在CLIP上性能显著下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据无关量化方法在扩展到视觉语言模型如CLIP时，由于合成样本语义内容不足和图像内部多样性低，导致性能显著下降。

Method: 提出D4C框架，包含三个关键组件：提示引导语义注入、结构对比生成和扰动感知增强，共同生成语义丰富且结构多样的伪图像。

Result: 在W4A8设置下，D4C在CLIP ResNet-50和ViT-B/32上显著提升零样本分类准确率，在CIFAR-10上分别提升12.4%和18.9%，在CIFAR-100上提升6.8%和19.7%，在ImageNet-1K上提升1.4%和5.7%。

Conclusion: D4C有效解决了CLIP模型数据无关量化的性能瓶颈，通过生成语义丰富且结构多样的合成图像，显著提升了量化模型的性能。

Abstract: Data-Free Quantization (DFQ) offers a practical solution for model compression without requiring access to real data, making it particularly attractive in privacy-sensitive scenarios. While DFQ has shown promise for unimodal models, its extension to Vision-Language Models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models remains underexplored. In this work, we reveal that directly applying existing DFQ techniques to CLIP results in substantial performance degradation due to two key limitations: insufficient semantic content and low intra-image diversity in synthesized samples. To tackle these challenges, we propose D4C, the first DFQ framework tailored for CLIP. D4C synthesizes semantically rich and structurally diverse pseudo images through three key components: (1) Prompt-Guided Semantic Injection aligns generated images with real-world semantics using text prompts; (2) Structural Contrastive Generation reproduces compositional structures of natural images by leveraging foreground-background contrastive synthesis; and (3) Perturbation-Aware Enhancement applies controlled perturbations to improve sample diversity and robustness. These components jointly empower D4C to synthesize images that are both semantically informative and structurally diverse, effectively bridging the performance gap of DFQ on CLIP. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of D4C, showing significant performance improvements on various bit-widths and models. For example, under the W4A8 setting with CLIP ResNet-50 and ViT-B/32, D4C achieves Top-1 accuracy improvement of 12.4% and 18.9% on CIFAR-10, 6.8% and 19.7% on CIFAR-100, and 1.4% and 5.7% on ImageNet-1K in zero-shot classification, respectively.

Abstract: We introduce WarNav, a novel real-world dataset constructed from images of the open-source DATTALION repository, specifically tailored to enable the development and benchmarking of semantic segmentation models for autonomous ground vehicle navigation in unstructured, conflict-affected environments. This dataset addresses a critical gap between conventional urban driving resources and the unique operational scenarios encountered by unmanned systems in hazardous and damaged war-zones. We detail the methodological challenges encountered, ranging from data heterogeneity to ethical considerations, providing guidance for future efforts that target extreme operational contexts. To establish performance references, we report baseline results on WarNav using several state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models trained on structured urban scenes. We further analyse the impact of training data environments and propose a first step towards effective navigability in challenging environments with the constraint of having no annotation of the targeted images. Our goal is to foster impactful research that enhances the robustness and safety of autonomous vehicles in high-risk scenarios while being frugal in annotated data.

Conclusion: RSC-MD方法通过解决梯度抑制和模态不平衡问题，实现了对每个模态特定骨干网络的全面优化，有效提升了多模态检测性能。

Abstract: Multimodal object detection has attracted significant attention in both academia and industry for its enhanced robustness. Although numerous studies have focused on improving modality fusion strategies, most neglect fusion degradation, and none provide a theoretical analysis of its underlying causes. To fill this gap, this paper presents a systematic theoretical investigation of fusion degradation in multimodal detection and identifies two key optimization deficiencies: (1) the gradients of unimodal branch backbones are severely suppressed under multimodal architectures, resulting in under-optimization of the unimodal branches; (2) disparities in modality quality cause weaker modalities to experience stronger gradient suppression, which in turn results in imbalanced modality learning. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Representation Space Constrained Learning with Modality Decoupling (RSC-MD) method, which consists of two modules. The RSC module and the MD module are designed to respectively amplify the suppressed gradients and eliminate inter-modality coupling interference as well as modality imbalance, thereby enabling the comprehensive optimization of each modality-specific backbone. Extensive experiments conducted on the FLIR, LLVIP, M3FD, and MFAD datasets demonstrate that the proposed method effectively alleviates fusion degradation and achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks. The code and training procedures will be released at https://github.com/yikangshao/RSC-MD.

Motivation: 再制造过程中需要手动检查拆卸部件的质量，由于部件种类和缺陷模式多样，自动化视觉检测面临泛化到新产品变体、部件或缺陷模式的挑战。

Method: 创建了包含两种汽车变速箱齿轮箱部件在良好和缺陷状态下的图像数据集，通过不同的训练-测试数据分割生成分布偏移来评估分类模型的泛化能力，并提出了对比正则化损失来增强模型鲁棒性。

Result: 结果表明，对比正则化损失能够有效提高模型对未见类型部件的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出的数据集和对比正则化损失方法有助于解决再制造质量检测中的泛化问题，为自动化视觉检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Remanufacturing describes a process where worn products are restored to like-new condition and it offers vast ecological and economic potentials. A key step is the quality inspection of disassembled components, which is mostly done manually due to the high variety of parts and defect patterns. Deep neural networks show great potential to automate such visual inspection tasks but struggle to generalize to new product variants, components, or defect patterns. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel image dataset depicting typical gearbox components in good and defective condition from two automotive transmissions. Depending on the train-test split of the data, different distribution shifts are generated to benchmark the generalization ability of a classification model. We evaluate different models using the dataset and propose a contrastive regularization loss to enhance model robustness. The results obtained demonstrate the ability of the loss to improve generalisation to unseen types of components.

Abstract: Object detection in autonomous driving suffers from motion blur and saturation under fast motion and extreme lighting. Spike cameras, offer microsecond latency and ultra high dynamic range for object detection by using per pixel asynchronous integrate and fire. However, their sparse, discrete output cannot be processed by standard image-based detectors, posing a critical challenge for end to end spike stream detection. We propose EASD, an end to end spike camera detector with a dual branch design: a Temporal Based Texture plus Feature Fusion branch for global cross slice semantics, and an Entropy Selective Attention branch for object centric details. To close the data gap, we introduce DSEC Spike, the first driving oriented simulated spike detection benchmark.

TL;DR: Sigmma是一个多模态对比对齐框架，用于在多个尺度上学习HE图像和空间转录组谱的层次表示，通过多尺度对比对齐和图表示细胞相互作用，显著提升了基因表达预测和跨模态检索性能。

Motivation: 现有方法通常只在单一尺度上将HE图像切片与相应的空间转录组谱对齐，忽略了细粒度细胞结构及其空间组织。

Method: 提出Sigmma框架，包含多尺度对比对齐确保不同尺度的表示在模态间保持一致，并通过图表示细胞相互作用，整合图间和图内关系来捕捉组织微环境中的细胞间相互作用。

Result: Sigmma在基因表达预测任务中平均提升9.78%，在跨模态检索任务中平均提升26.93%，并在下游分析中学习了有意义的多组织组织。

Conclusion: Sigmma通过学习层次表示更好地捕捉跨模态对应关系，在计算病理学任务中表现出显著改进。

Abstract: Recent advances in computational pathology have leveraged vision-language models to learn joint representations of Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) images with spatial transcriptomic (ST) profiles. However, existing approaches typically align HE tiles with their corresponding ST profiles at a single scale, overlooking fine-grained cellular structures and their spatial organization. To address this, we propose Sigmma, a multi-modal contrastive alignment framework for learning hierarchical representations of HE images and spatial transcriptome profiles across multiple scales. Sigmma introduces multi-scale contrastive alignment, ensuring that representations learned at different scales remain coherent across modalities. Furthermore, by representing cell interactions as a graph and integrating inter- and intra-subgraph relationships, our approach effectively captures cell-cell interactions, ranging from fine to coarse, within the tissue microenvironment. We demonstrate that Sigmm learns representations that better capture cross-modal correspondences, leading to an improvement of avg. 9.78\% in the gene-expression prediction task and avg. 26.93\% in the cross-modal retrieval task across datasets. We further show that it learns meaningful multi-tissue organization in downstream analyses.

Motivation: 围网渔船捕获了全球约69%的热带金枪鱼，电子监控系统产生大量视频数据需要人工处理。AI集成可以减轻工作量并提高报告准确性，但物种识别仍面临挑战。

Method: 使用多阶段流水线：比较三种分割方法（Mask R-CNN、DINOv2+SAM2、YOLOv9+SAM2），用ByteTrack跟踪个体，评估标准多类分类和分层分类方法。

Result: YOLOv9-SAM2表现最佳，验证mAP为0.66±0.03，召回率0.88±0.03。结合分层分类，84.8%的个体被分割和分类，平均误差为4.5%。

Conclusion: YOLOv9-SAM2与分层分类结合的方法能有效估计金枪鱼捕捞的物种组成，为电子监控系统的AI集成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Purse seiners play a crucial role in tuna fishing, as approximately 69% of the world's tropical tuna is caught using this gear. All tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organizations have established minimum standards to use electronic monitoring (EM) in fisheries in addition to traditional observers. The EM systems produce a massive amount of video data that human analysts must process. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into their workflow can decrease that workload and improve the accuracy of the reports. However, species identification still poses significant challenges for AI, as achieving balanced performance across all species requires appropriate training data. Here, we quantify the difficulty experts face to distinguish bigeye tuna (BET, Thunnus Obesus) from yellowfin tuna (YFT, Thunnus Albacares) using images captured by EM systems. We found inter-expert agreements of 42.9% $\pm$ 35.6% for BET and 57.1% $\pm$ 35.6% for YFT. We then present a multi-stage pipeline to estimate the species composition of the catches using a reliable ground-truth dataset based on identifications made by observers on board. Three segmentation approaches are compared: Mask R-CNN, a combination of DINOv2 with SAM2, and a integration of YOLOv9 with SAM2. We found that the latest performs the best, with a validation mean average precision of 0.66 $\pm$ 0.03 and a recall of 0.88 $\pm$ 0.03. Segmented individuals are tracked using ByteTrack. For classification, we evaluate a standard multiclass classification model and a hierarchical approach, finding a superior generalization by the hierarchical. All our models were cross-validated during training and tested on fishing operations with fully known catch composition. Combining YOLOv9-SAM2 with the hierarchical classification produced the best estimations, with 84.8% of the individuals being segmented and classified with a mean average error of 4.5%.

Conclusion: RS-CA-HSICT框架通过有效结合CNN和Transformer的优势，在MPox检测任务中取得了优异的性能，证明了混合架构的有效性。

Abstract: This work proposes a hybrid deep learning approach, namely Residual and Spatial Learning based Channel Augmented Integrated CNN-Transformer architecture, that leverages the strengths of CNN and Transformer towards enhanced MPox detection. The proposed RS-CA-HSICT framework is composed of an HSICT block, a residual CNN module, a spatial CNN block, and a CA, which enhances the diverse feature space, detailed lesion information, and long-range dependencies. The new HSICT module first integrates an abstract representation of the stem CNN and customized ICT blocks for efficient multihead attention and structured CNN layers with homogeneous (H) and structural (S) operations. The customized ICT blocks learn global contextual interactions and local texture extraction. Additionally, H and S layers learn spatial homogeneity and fine structural details by reducing noise and modeling complex morphological variations. Moreover, inverse residual learning enhances vanishing gradient, and stage-wise resolution reduction ensures scale invariance. Furthermore, the RS-CA-HSICT framework augments the learned HSICT channels with the TL-driven Residual and Spatial CNN maps for enhanced multiscale feature space capturing global and localized structural cues, subtle texture, and contrast variations. These channels, preceding augmentation, are refined through the Channel-Fusion-and-Attention block, which preserves discriminative channels while suppressing redundant ones, thereby enabling efficient computation. Finally, the spatial attention mechanism refines pixel selection to detect subtle patterns and intra-class contrast variations in Mpox. Experimental results on both the Kaggle benchmark and a diverse MPox dataset reported classification accuracy as high as 98.30% and an F1-score of 98.13%, which outperforms the existing CNNs and ViTs.

Abstract: Densely annotated medical image datasets that capture not only diagnostic labels but also the underlying reasoning behind these diagnoses are scarce. Such reasoning-related annotations are essential for developing and evaluating explainable AI (xAI) models that reason similarly to radiologists: making correct predictions for the right reasons. To address this gap, we introduce FunnyNodules, a fully parameterized synthetic dataset designed for systematic analysis of attribute-based reasoning in medical AI models. The dataset generates abstract, lung nodule-like shapes with controllable visual attributes such as roundness, margin sharpness, and spiculation. Target class is derived from a predefined attribute combination, allowing full control over the decision rule that links attributes to the diagnostic class. We demonstrate how FunnyNodules can be used in model-agnostic evaluations to assess whether models learn correct attribute-target relations, to interpret over- or underperformance in attribute prediction, and to analyze attention alignment with attribute-specific regions of interest. The framework is fully customizable, supporting variations in dataset complexity, target definitions, class balance, and beyond. With complete ground truth information, FunnyNodules provides a versatile foundation for developing, benchmarking, and conducting in-depth analyses of explainable AI methods in medical image analysis.

Most learning-based low-light enhancement methods rely on paired training data captured under a single low-light condition and a well-lit reference. The lack of radiance diversity limits our understanding of how enhancement techniques perform across varying illumination intensities. We introduce the Multi-Illumination Low-Light (MILL) dataset, containing images captured at diverse light intensities under controlled conditions with fixed camera settings and precise illuminance measurements. MILL enables comprehensive evaluation of enhancement algorithms across variable lighting conditions. We benchmark several state-of-the-art methods and reveal significant performance variations across intensity levels. Leveraging the unique multi-illumination structure of our dataset, we propose improvements that enhance robustness across diverse illumination scenarios. Our modifications achieve up to 10 dB PSNR improvement for DSLR and 2 dB for the smartphone on Full HD images.

Abstract: Autoregressive models have recently shown great promise in visual generation by leveraging discrete token sequences akin to language modeling. However, existing approaches often suffer from inefficiency, either due to token-by-token decoding or the complexity of multi-scale representations. In this work, we introduce Expanding Autoregressive Representation (EAR), a novel generation paradigm that emulates the human visual system's center-outward perception pattern. EAR unfolds image tokens in a spiral order from the center and progressively expands outward, preserving spatial continuity and enabling efficient parallel decoding. To further enhance flexibility and speed, we propose a length-adaptive decoding strategy that dynamically adjusts the number of tokens predicted at each step. This biologically inspired design not only reduces computational cost but also improves generation quality by aligning the generation order with perceptual relevance. Extensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that EAR achieves state-of-the-art trade-offs between fidelity and efficiency on single-scale autoregressive models, setting a new direction for scalable and cognitively aligned autoregressive image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MTGNet是一个双分支框架，通过融合多样文本提示来增强少样本语义分割性能，解决了单文本描述无法捕捉复杂类别语义多样性和缺乏跨模态交互的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于CLIP的少样本语义分割方法使用单一文本提示，导致目标区域激活不完整，无法充分捕捉复杂类别的语义多样性，且缺乏显式跨模态交互，容易受到噪声支持特征的影响。

Method: 提出MTGNet框架，包含三个关键模块：多文本先验精炼模块(MTPR)抑制干扰并聚合互补语义线索；文本锚点特征融合模块(TAFF)利用多文本嵌入作为语义锚点促进局部原型传递；前景置信度加权注意力模块(FCWA)增强视觉先验鲁棒性。

Result: 在标准FSS基准测试中，1-shot设置下在PASCAL-5i上达到76.8% mIoU，在COCO-20i上达到57.4% mIoU，在具有高类内变异的fold上表现显著提升。

Conclusion: MTGNet通过多文本引导和跨模态优化有效提升了少样本语义分割性能，特别是在处理复杂结构和类内变异大的类别时表现出色。

Abstract: Recent CLIP-based few-shot semantic segmentation methods introduce class-level textual priors to assist segmentation by typically using a single prompt (e.g., a photo of class). However, these approaches often result in incomplete activation of target regions, as a single textual description cannot fully capture the semantic diversity of complex categories. Moreover, they lack explicit cross-modal interaction and are vulnerable to noisy support features, further degrading visual prior quality. To address these issues, we propose the Multi-Text Guided Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation Network (MTGNet), a dual-branch framework that enhances segmentation performance by fusing diverse textual prompts to refine textual priors and guide the cross-modal optimization of visual priors. Specifically, we design a Multi-Textual Prior Refinement (MTPR) module that suppresses interference and aggregates complementary semantic cues to enhance foreground activation and expand semantic coverage for structurally complex objects. We introduce a Text Anchor Feature Fusion (TAFF) module, which leverages multi-text embeddings as semantic anchors to facilitate the transfer of discriminative local prototypes from support images to query images, thereby improving semantic consistency and alleviating intra-class variations. Furthermore, a Foreground Confidence-Weighted Attention (FCWA) module is presented to enhance visual prior robustness by leveraging internal self-similarity within support foreground features. It adaptively down-weights inconsistent regions and effectively suppresses interference in the query segmentation process. Extensive experiments on standard FSS benchmarks validate the effectiveness of MTGNet. In the 1-shot setting, it achieves 76.8% mIoU on PASCAL-5i and 57.4% on COCO-20i, with notable improvements in folds exhibiting high intra-class variations.

Abstract: The task of weed detection is an essential element of precision agriculture since accurate species identification allows a farmer to selectively apply herbicides and fits into sustainable agriculture crop management. This paper proposes a hybrid deep learning framework recipe for weed detection that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViTs), and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to build robustness to multiple field conditions. A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based augmentation method was imposed to balance class distributions and better generalize the model. Further, a self-supervised contrastive pre-training method helps to learn more features from limited annotated data. Experimental results yield superior results with 99.33% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on multi-benchmark datasets. The proposed model architecture enables local, global, and relational feature representations and offers high interpretability and adaptability. Practically, the framework allows real-time, efficient deployment to edge devices for automated weed detecting, reducing over-reliance on herbicides and providing scalable, sustainable precision-farming options.

Abstract: Human pose forecasting predicts future poses based on past observations, and has many significant applications in areas such as action recognition, autonomous driving or human-robot interaction. This paper evaluates a wide range of pose forecasting algorithms in the task of absolute pose forecasting, revealing many reproducibility issues, and provides a unified training and evaluation pipeline. After drawing a high-level analogy to the task of speech understanding, it is shown that recent speech models can be efficiently adapted to the task of pose forecasting, and improve current state-of-the-art performance. At last the robustness of the models is evaluated, using noisy joint coordinates obtained from a pose estimator model, to reflect a realistic type of noise, which is more close to real-world applications. For this a new dataset variation is introduced, and it is shown that estimated poses result in a substantial performance degradation, and how much of it can be recovered again by unsupervised finetuning.

Abstract: Recent AI-generated image (AIGI) detectors achieve impressive accuracy under clean condition. In view of antiforensics, it is significant to develop advanced adversarial attacks for evaluating the security of such detectors, which remains unexplored sufficiently. This letter proposes a Dual-domain Feature Importance Attack (DuFIA) scheme to invalidate AIGI detectors to some extent. Forensically important features are captured by the spatially interpolated gradient and frequency-aware perturbation. The adversarial transferability is enhanced by jointly modeling spatial and frequency-domain feature importances, which are fused to guide the optimization-based adversarial example generation. Extensive experiments across various AIGI detectors verify the cross-model transferability, transparency and robustness of DuFIA.

Conclusion: ViT特征蒸馏失败的原因是师生编码不匹配，利用低秩结构可以设计出有效、可解释的补救措施，为紧凑ViT设计提供具体指导。

Abstract: Feature-map knowledge distillation (KD) is highly effective for convolutional networks but often fails for Vision Transformers (ViTs). To understand this failure and guide method design, we conduct a two-view representation analysis of ViTs. First, a layer-wise Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of full feature matrices shows that final-layer representations are globally low-rank: for CaiT-S24, only $121/61/34/14$ dimensions suffice to capture $99\%/95\%/90\%/80\%$ of the energy. In principle, this suggests that a compact student plus a simple linear projector should be enough for feature alignment, contradicting the weak empirical performance of standard feature KD. To resolve this paradox, we introduce a token-level Spectral Energy Pattern (SEP) analysis that measures how each token uses channel capacity. SEP reveals that, despite the global low-rank structure, individual tokens distribute energy over most channels, forming a high-bandwidth encoding pattern. This results in an encoding mismatch between wide teachers and narrow students. Motivated by this insight, we propose two minimal, mismatch-driven strategies: (1) post-hoc feature lifting with a lightweight projector retained during inference, or (2) native width alignment that widens only the student's last block to the teacher's width. On ImageNet-1K, these strategies reactivate simple feature-map distillation in ViTs, raising DeiT-Tiny accuracy from $74.86\%$ to $77.53\%$ and $78.23\%$ when distilling from CaiT-S24, while also improving standalone students trained without any teacher. Our analysis thus explains why ViT feature distillation fails and shows how exploiting low-rank structure yields effective, interpretable remedies and concrete design guidance for compact ViTs.

Abstract: With the increasing prevalence of video content, effectively understanding and answering questions about long form videos has become essential for numerous applications. Although large vision language models (LVLMs) have enhanced performance, they often face challenges with nuanced queries that demand both a comprehensive understanding and detailed analysis. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce AVATAAR, a modular and interpretable framework that combines global and local video context, along with a Pre Retrieval Thinking Agent and a Rethink Module. AVATAAR creates a persistent global summary and establishes a feedback loop between the Rethink Module and the Pre Retrieval Thinking Agent, allowing the system to refine its retrieval strategies based on partial answers and replicate human-like iterative reasoning. On the CinePile benchmark, AVATAAR demonstrates significant improvements over a baseline, achieving relative gains of +5.6% in temporal reasoning, +5% in technical queries, +8% in theme-based questions, and +8.2% in narrative comprehension. Our experiments confirm that each module contributes positively to the overall performance, with the feedback loop being crucial for adaptability. These findings highlight AVATAAR's effectiveness in enhancing video understanding capabilities. Ultimately, AVATAAR presents a scalable solution for long-form Video Question Answering (QA), merging accuracy, interpretability, and extensibility.

Conclusion: CompTrack通过系统性地消除点云中的双重冗余，在保持高精度的同时实现了高效的实时3D目标跟踪。

Abstract: 3D single object tracking (SOT) in LiDAR point clouds is a critical task in computer vision and autonomous driving. Despite great success having been achieved, the inherent sparsity of point clouds introduces a dual-redundancy challenge that limits existing trackers: (1) vast spatial redundancy from background noise impairs accuracy, and (2) informational redundancy within the foreground hinders efficiency. To tackle these issues, we propose CompTrack, a novel end-to-end framework that systematically eliminates both forms of redundancy in point clouds. First, CompTrack incorporates a Spatial Foreground Predictor (SFP) module to filter out irrelevant background noise based on information entropy, addressing spatial redundancy. Subsequently, its core is an Information Bottleneck-guided Dynamic Token Compression (IB-DTC) module that eliminates the informational redundancy within the foreground. Theoretically grounded in low-rank approximation, this module leverages an online SVD analysis to adaptively compress the redundant foreground into a compact and highly informative set of proxy tokens. Extensive experiments on KITTI, nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrate that CompTrack achieves top-performing tracking performance with superior efficiency, running at a real-time 90 FPS on a single RTX 3090 GPU.

Abstract: Ultrasound offers a radiation-free, cost-effective solution for real-time visualization of spinal landmarks, paraspinal soft tissues and neurovascular structures, making it valuable for intraoperative guidance during spinal procedures. However, ultrasound suffers from inherent limitations in visualizing complete vertebral anatomy, in particular vertebral bodies, due to acoustic shadowing effects caused by bone. In this work, we present a novel multi-modal deep learning method for completing occluded anatomical structures in 3D ultrasound by leveraging complementary information from a single X-ray image. To enable training, we generate paired training data consisting of: (1) 2D lateral vertebral views that simulate X-ray scans, and (2) 3D partial vertebrae representations that mimic the limited visibility and occlusions encountered during ultrasound spine imaging. Our method integrates morphological information from both imaging modalities and demonstrates significant improvements in vertebral reconstruction (p < 0.001) compared to state of art in 3D ultrasound vertebral completion. We perform phantom studies as an initial step to future clinical translation, and achieve a more accurate, complete volumetric lumbar spine visualization overlayed on the ultrasound scan without the need for registration with preoperative modalities such as computed tomography. This demonstrates that integrating a single X-ray projection mitigates ultrasound's key limitation while preserving its strengths as the primary imaging modality.

Abstract: LiDAR place recognition plays a crucial role in SLAM, robot navigation, and autonomous driving. However, existing LiDAR place recognition methods often struggle to adapt to new environments without forgetting previously learned knowledge, a challenge widely known as catastrophic forgetting. To address this issue, we propose KDF+, a novel continual learning framework for LiDAR place recognition that extends the KDF paradigm with a loss-aware sampling strategy and a rehearsal enhancement mechanism. The proposed sampling strategy estimates the learning difficulty of each sample via its loss value and selects samples for replay according to their estimated difficulty. Harder samples, which tend to encode more discriminative information, are sampled with higher probability while maintaining distributional coverage across the dataset. In addition, the rehearsal enhancement mechanism encourages memory samples to be further refined during new-task training by slightly reducing their loss relative to previous tasks, thereby reinforcing long-term knowledge retention. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that KDF+ consistently outperforms existing continual learning methods and can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art continual learning for LiDAR place recognition frameworks to yield significant and stable performance gains. The code will be available at https://github.com/repo/KDF-plus.

Method: 1. 使用外部知识图谱作为监督，在双曲空间中嵌入视觉和文本特征以保持层次结构；2. 将梯度投影到共享双曲映射器的零空间，防止对先前任务的干扰。

Result: 大量实验表明HASTEN持续优于现有方法，并提供统一的结构化表示。

Conclusion: HASTEN通过维护层次关系使模型能够抵抗遗忘，在类增量学习中表现出色。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) enables models to learn new classes continually while preserving past knowledge. Recently, vision-language models like CLIP offer transferable features via multi-modal pre-training, making them well-suited for CIL. However, real-world visual and linguistic concepts are inherently hierarchical: a textual concept like "dog" subsumes fine-grained categories such as "Labrador" and "Golden Retriever," and each category entails its images. But existing CLIP-based CIL methods fail to explicitly capture this inherent hierarchy, leading to fine-grained class features drift during incremental updates and ultimately to catastrophic forgetting. To address this challenge, we propose HASTEN (Hierarchical Semantic Tree Anchoring) that anchors hierarchical information into CIL to reduce catastrophic forgetting. First, we employ an external knowledge graph as supervision to embed visual and textual features in hyperbolic space, effectively preserving hierarchical structure as data evolves. Second, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, we project gradients onto the null space of the shared hyperbolic mapper, preventing interference with prior tasks. These two steps work synergistically to enable the model to resist forgetting by maintaining hierarchical relationships. Extensive experiments show that HASTEN consistently outperforms existing methods while providing a unified structured representation.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation typically adopts a point-wise convolutional segmentation head to predict dense labels, where each output channel is heuristically tied to a specific class. This rigid design limits both feature sharing and semantic generalization. In this work, we propose a unified decoupled segmentation head that separates multi-class prediction into class-agnostic mask prediction and class label prediction using shared object queries. Furthermore, we introduce a Full-Scale Aware Deformable Transformer module that enables low-resolution encoder features to attend across full-resolution encoder features via deformable attention, achieving memory-efficient and spatially aligned full-scale fusion. Our proposed method, named MaskMed, achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing nnUNet by +2.0% Dice on AMOS 2022 and +6.9% Dice on BTCV.

Conclusion: 网格数据中的结构先验可以被系统性地利用来加速和增强自回归生成

Abstract: Autoregressive models can generate high-quality 3D meshes by sequentially producing vertices and faces, but their token-by-token decoding results in slow inference, limiting practical use in interactive and large-scale applications. We present FlashMesh, a fast and high-fidelity mesh generation framework that rethinks autoregressive decoding through a predict-correct-verify paradigm. The key insight is that mesh tokens exhibit strong structural and geometric correlations that enable confident multi-token speculation. FlashMesh leverages this by introducing a speculative decoding scheme tailored to the commonly used hourglass transformer architecture, enabling parallel prediction across face, point, and coordinate levels. Extensive experiments show that FlashMesh achieves up to a 2 x speedup over standard autoregressive models while also improving generation fidelity. Our results demonstrate that structural priors in mesh data can be systematically harnessed to accelerate and enhance autoregressive generation.

Abstract: Automated video analysis is critical for wildlife conservation. A foundational task in this domain is multi-animal tracking (MAT), which underpins applications such as individual re-identification and behavior recognition. However, existing datasets are limited in scale, constrained to a few species, or lack sufficient temporal and geographical diversity - leaving no suitable benchmark for training general-purpose MAT models applicable across wild animal populations. To address this, we introduce SA-FARI, the largest open-source MAT dataset for wild animals. It comprises 11,609 camera trap videos collected over approximately 10 years (2014-2024) from 741 locations across 4 continents, spanning 99 species categories. Each video is exhaustively annotated culminating in ~46 hours of densely annotated footage containing 16,224 masklet identities and 942,702 individual bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and species labels. Alongside the task-specific annotations, we publish anonymized camera trap locations for each video. Finally, we present comprehensive benchmarks on SA-FARI using state-of-the-art vision-language models for detection and tracking, including SAM 3, evaluated with both species-specific and generic animal prompts. We also compare against vision-only methods developed specifically for wildlife analysis. SA-FARI is the first large-scale dataset to combine high species diversity, multi-region coverage, and high-quality spatio-temporal annotations, offering a new foundation for advancing generalizable multianimal tracking in the wild. The dataset is available at $\href{https://www.conservationxlabs.com/sa-fari}{\text{conservationxlabs.com/SA-FARI}}$.

TL;DR: GEO-Bench-2是一个用于评估地理空间基础模型的标准化基准框架，涵盖19个数据集和多种任务类型，通过能力分组来比较模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前地理空间基础模型评估缺乏标准化协议，需要统一的评估框架来促进模型比较和方法创新。

Method: 建立包含分类、分割、回归、目标检测和实例分割的综合性评估框架，引入能力分组概念，定义灵活但规范的评估协议。

Result: 实验表明没有单一模型在所有任务上表现最优，自然图像预训练模型在高分辨率任务上表现好，而EO专用模型在多光谱应用上更优。

Conclusion: 最佳模型选择取决于任务需求和数据特性，通用地理空间基础模型仍是一个开放的研究方向，GEO-Bench-2为特定用例提供可复现的评估工具。

Abstract: Geospatial Foundation Models (GeoFMs) are transforming Earth Observation (EO), but evaluation lacks standardized protocols. GEO-Bench-2 addresses this with a comprehensive framework spanning classification, segmentation, regression, object detection, and instance segmentation across 19 permissively-licensed datasets. We introduce ''capability'' groups to rank models on datasets that share common characteristics (e.g., resolution, bands, temporality). This enables users to identify which models excel in each capability and determine which areas need improvement in future work. To support both fair comparison and methodological innovation, we define a prescriptive yet flexible evaluation protocol. This not only ensures consistency in benchmarking but also facilitates research into model adaptation strategies, a key and open challenge in advancing GeoFMs for downstream tasks.
  Our experiments show that no single model dominates across all tasks, confirming the specificity of the choices made during architecture design and pretraining. While models pretrained on natural images (ConvNext ImageNet, DINO V3) excel on high-resolution tasks, EO-specific models (TerraMind, Prithvi, and Clay) outperform them on multispectral applications such as agriculture and disaster response. These findings demonstrate that optimal model choice depends on task requirements, data modalities, and constraints. This shows that the goal of a single GeoFM model that performs well across all tasks remains open for future research. GEO-Bench-2 enables informed, reproducible GeoFM evaluation tailored to specific use cases. Code, data, and leaderboard for GEO-Bench-2 are publicly released under a permissive license.

TL;DR: 提出了MUSSE-Net，一种用于超声应变弹性成像的无监督深度学习框架，通过多阶段处理和残差细化来克服组织去相关噪声和变形条件不一致的问题，在仿真和临床数据上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声应变弹性成像在临床应用中受到组织去相关噪声、缺乏真实标签以及不同变形条件下应变估计不一致的限制，需要开发更鲁棒和一致的应变估计方法。

Conclusion: MUSSE-Net在超声应变弹性成像中实现了最先进的性能，能够生成临床可解释的应变模式，为临床诊断提供了可靠的工具。

Abstract: Ultrasound Strain Elastography (USE) is a powerful non-invasive imaging technique for assessing tissue mechanical properties, offering crucial diagnostic value across diverse clinical applications. However, its clinical application remains limited by tissue decorrelation noise, scarcity of ground truth, and inconsistent strain estimation under different deformation conditions. Overcoming these barriers, we propose MUSSE-Net, a residual-aware, multi-stage unsupervised sequential deep learning framework designed for robust and consistent strain estimation. At its backbone lies our proposed USSE-Net, an end-to-end multi-stream encoder-decoder architecture that parallelly processes pre- and post-deformation RF sequences to estimate displacement fields and axial strains. The novel architecture incorporates Context-Aware Complementary Feature Fusion (CACFF)-based encoder with Tri-Cross Attention (TCA) bottleneck with a Cross-Attentive Fusion (CAF)-based sequential decoder. To ensure temporal coherence and strain stability across varying deformation levels, this architecture leverages a tailored consistency loss. Finally, with the MUSSE-Net framework, a secondary residual refinement stage further enhances accuracy and suppresses noise. Extensive validation on simulation, in vivo, and private clinical datasets from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) medical center, demonstrates MUSSE-Net's outperformed existing unsupervised approaches. On MUSSE-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with a target SNR of 24.54, background SNR of 132.76, CNR of 59.81, and elastographic SNR of 9.73 on simulation data. In particular, on the BUET dataset, MUSSE-Net produces strain maps with enhanced lesion-to-background contrast and significant noise suppression yielding clinically interpretable strain patterns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新评估全局坐标系在行人惯性里程计中的适用性，因为无人机场景研究表明体坐标系能显著提升定位精度。

Method: 使用拉普拉斯金字塔将IMU测量分解为高频和低频分量，低频分量由Mamba架构处理提取隐式上下文运动线索，高频分量由卷积结构处理捕捉细粒度局部运动细节。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上的实验表明，MambaIO显著降低了定位误差并实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 这是Mamba架构在惯性里程计任务中的首次应用，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Inertial Odometry (IO) enables real-time localization using only acceleration and angular velocity measurements from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), making it a promising solution for localization in consumer-grade applications. Traditionally, IMU measurements in IO have been processed under two coordinate system paradigms: the body coordinate frame and the global coordinate frame, with the latter being widely adopted. However, recent studies in drone scenarios have demonstrated that the body frame can significantly improve localization accuracy, prompting a re-evaluation of the suitability of the global frame for pedestrian IO. To address this issue, this paper systematically evaluates the effectiveness of the global coordinate frame in pedestrian IO through theoretical analysis, qualitative inspection, and quantitative experiments. Building upon these findings, we further propose MambaIO, which decomposes IMU measurements into high-frequency and low-frequency components using a Laplacian pyramid. The low-frequency component is processed by a Mamba architecture to extract implicit contextual motion cues, while the high-frequency component is handled by a convolutional structure to capture fine-grained local motion details. Experiments on multiple public datasets show that MambaIO substantially reduces localization error and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of the Mamba architecture to the inertial odometry task.

Abstract: Large community science platforms such as iNaturalist contain hundreds of millions of biodiversity images that often capture ecological context on behaviors, interactions, phenology, and habitat. Yet most ecological workflows rely on metadata filtering or manual inspection, leaving this secondary information inaccessible at scale. We introduce INQUIRE-Search, an open-source system that enables scientists to rapidly and interactively search within an ecological image database for specific concepts using natural language, verify and export relevant observations, and utilize this discovered data for novel scientific analysis. Compared to traditional methods, INQUIRE-Search takes a fraction of the time, opening up new possibilities for scientific questions that can be explored. Through five case studies, we show the diversity of scientific applications that a tool like INQUIRE-Search can support, from seasonal variation in behavior across species to forest regrowth after wildfires. These examples demonstrate a new paradigm for interactive, efficient, and scalable scientific discovery that can begin to unlock previously inaccessible scientific value in large-scale biodiversity datasets. Finally, we emphasize using such AI-enabled discovery tools for science call for experts to reframe the priorities of the scientific process and develop novel methods for experiment design, data collection, survey effort, and uncertainty analysis.

TL;DR: 提出多频率图卷积网络(MF-GCN)用于抑郁症检测，通过眼动追踪、音频和视频数据，利用低高频信号进行跨模态分析，在二分类和三分类任务中均优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于图的模型仅关注低频信息的局限性，需要同时利用低高频信号来更准确地检测抑郁症。

Method: 开发多频率图卷积网络(MF-GCN)，包含新颖的多频率滤波器组模块(MFFBM)，能够同时利用低高频信号进行跨模态抑郁症检测。

Result: 二分类敏感度0.96，F2分数0.94；三分类敏感度0.79，特异度0.87；在CMDC数据集上敏感度0.95，F2分数0.96，均显著优于其他模型。

Conclusion: 该三模态多频率框架能有效捕捉跨模态交互，实现准确的抑郁症检测，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Eye tracking data quantifies the attentional bias towards negative stimuli that is frequently observed in depressed groups. Audio and video data capture the affective flattening and psychomotor retardation characteristic of depression. Statistical validation confirmed their significant discriminative power in distinguishing depressed from non depressed groups. We address a critical limitation of existing graph-based models that focus on low-frequency information and propose a Multi-Frequency Graph Convolutional Network (MF-GCN). This framework consists of a novel Multi-Frequency Filter Bank Module (MFFBM), which can leverage both low and high frequency signals. Extensive evaluation against traditional machine learning algorithms and deep learning frameworks demonstrates that MF-GCN consistently outperforms baselines. In binary (depressed and non depressed) classification, the model achieved a sensitivity of 0.96 and F2 score of 0.94. For the 3 class (no depression, mild to moderate depression and severe depression) classification task, the proposed method achieved a sensitivity of 0.79 and specificity of 0.87 and siginificantly suprassed other models. To validate generalizability, the model was also evaluated on the Chinese Multimodal Depression Corpus (CMDC) dataset and achieved a sensitivity of 0.95 and F2 score of 0.96. These results confirm that our trimodal, multi frequency framework effectively captures cross modal interaction for accurate depression detection.

Motivation: 传统观点将视频首帧视为时空起点，但作者发现视频模型实际上将其作为概念记忆缓冲区来存储视觉实体以供后续生成时复用。

Method: 利用视频模型隐含的首帧概念记忆机制，无需架构修改或大规模微调，仅使用20-50个训练样本实现视频内容定制。

Result: 该方法在多样化场景中实现了鲁棒且通用的视频内容定制，展现了视频生成模型在基于参考的视频定制方面的强大能力。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了视频生成模型中被忽视的强大能力——基于参考的视频定制，为首帧角色提供了全新理解视角。

Abstract: What role does the first frame play in video generation models? Traditionally, it's viewed as the spatial-temporal starting point of a video, merely a seed for subsequent animation. In this work, we reveal a fundamentally different perspective: video models implicitly treat the first frame as a conceptual memory buffer that stores visual entities for later reuse during generation. Leveraging this insight, we show that it's possible to achieve robust and generalized video content customization in diverse scenarios, using only 20-50 training examples without architectural changes or large-scale finetuning. This unveils a powerful, overlooked capability of video generation models for reference-based video customization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代理视觉推理研究主要关注图像处理工具，缺乏面向通用代理模型的地理定位能力评估，需要同时具备视觉基础和网络搜索能力的综合解决方案。

Method: 开发GeoVista代理模型，集成图像放大和网络搜索工具；采用两阶段训练流程：监督微调学习推理模式和工具使用先验，强化学习阶段增强推理能力；使用分层奖励利用多级地理信息。

Result: GeoVista在GeoBench基准上大幅超越其他开源代理模型，在大多数指标上达到与Gemini-2.5-flash和GPT-5等闭源模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的GeoVista模型和GeoBench基准有效解决了代理模型地理定位能力的评估需求，证明了集成工具调用和分层奖励策略的有效性。

Abstract: Current research on agentic visual reasoning enables deep multimodal understanding but primarily focuses on image manipulation tools, leaving a gap toward more general-purpose agentic models. In this work, we revisit the geolocalization task, which requires not only nuanced visual grounding but also web search to confirm or refine hypotheses during reasoning. Since existing geolocalization benchmarks fail to meet the need for high-resolution imagery and the localization challenge for deep agentic reasoning, we curate GeoBench, a benchmark that includes photos and panoramas from around the world, along with a subset of satellite images of different cities to rigorously evaluate the geolocalization ability of agentic models. We also propose GeoVista, an agentic model that seamlessly integrates tool invocation within the reasoning loop, including an image-zoom-in tool to magnify regions of interest and a web-search tool to retrieve related web information. We develop a complete training pipeline for it, including a cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage to learn reasoning patterns and tool-use priors, followed by a reinforcement learning (RL) stage to further enhance reasoning ability. We adopt a hierarchical reward to leverage multi-level geographical information and improve overall geolocalization performance. Experimental results show that GeoVista surpasses other open-source agentic models on the geolocalization task greatly and achieves performance comparable to closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-flash and GPT-5 on most metrics.

Method: 构建新颖匹配架构和损失函数，结合多样化训练分布；采用解耦的两阶段匹配-精炼流程；利用DINOv3基础模型增强鲁棒性；开发定制CUDA内核减少内存使用

Result: 在广泛实验中，新匹配器显著优于先前方法，建立了新的最先进水平

Conclusion: 通过系统性的架构、训练和优化改进，成功开发出更准确、高效和鲁棒的密集特征匹配模型

Abstract: Dense feature matching aims to estimate all correspondences between two images of a 3D scene and has recently been established as the gold-standard due to its high accuracy and robustness. However, existing dense matchers still fail or perform poorly for many hard real-world scenarios, and high-precision models are often slow, limiting their applicability. In this paper, we attack these weaknesses on a wide front through a series of systematic improvements that together yield a significantly better model. In particular, we construct a novel matching architecture and loss, which, combined with a curated diverse training distribution, enables our model to solve many complex matching tasks. We further make training faster through a decoupled two-stage matching-then-refinement pipeline, and at the same time, significantly reduce refinement memory usage through a custom CUDA kernel. Finally, we leverage the recent DINOv3 foundation model along with multiple other insights to make the model more robust and unbiased. In our extensive set of experiments we show that the resulting novel matcher sets a new state-of-the-art, being significantly more accurate than its predecessors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型语言模型在思维链推理过程中何时内部确定最终答案，以及这种早期承诺对模型可解释性和推理时控制的影响。

Method: 通过在推理过程的前t个token后的隐藏状态上训练线性分类器，来预测最终答案的正确性。

Result: 最终正确性在仅经过几个token后就能高度预测，即使需要更长输出才能得到明确答案。对于难题，预测准确率下降，表明长CoT中难题比例过高。

Conclusion: 推理模型的内部自我评估在仅几个token后就趋于显现，这对可解释性和推理时控制具有重要意义。

Abstract: The chain-of-thought (CoT) paradigm uses the elicitation of step-by-step rationales as a proxy for reasoning, gradually refining the model's latent representation of a solution. However, it remains unclear just how early a Large Language Model (LLM) internally commits to an eventual outcome. We probe this by training linear classifiers on hidden states after the first t reasoning tokens, showing that eventual correctness is highly predictable after only a few tokens, even when longer outputs are needed to reach a definite answer. We show that, for harder questions, a drop in predictive accuracy highlights a selection artifact: hard items are disproportionately represented in long CoTs. Overall, our results imply that for reasoning models, internal self-assessment of success tends to emerge after only a few tokens, with implications for interpretability and for inference-time control.

TL;DR: LiveCLKTBench是一个自动化生成管道，专门用于隔离和测量大型语言模型的跨语言知识迁移，通过时间敏感的知识实体来评估真实的跨语言迁移能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型的跨语言知识迁移具有挑战性，因为目标语言中的正确答案可能来自真实的迁移，也可能来自预训练期间的先前接触。需要一种方法来区分这两种情况。

Method: 提出LiveCLKTBench自动化生成管道：识别现实领域中的自包含、时间敏感知识实体，基于时间发生进行过滤，验证模型知识，然后生成事实性问题并翻译成多种语言来评估跨语言迁移。

Result: 评估多个LLM在五种语言上的表现，发现跨语言迁移受语言距离强烈影响，在不同语言方向上往往不对称。更大的模型能改善迁移，但收益随规模增加而递减，且在不同领域间变化。

Conclusion: LiveCLKTBench为多语言迁移研究提供了新的见解，并证明其作为未来研究的可靠基准的价值。

Abstract: Evaluating cross-lingual knowledge transfer in large language models is challenging, as correct answers in a target language may arise either from genuine transfer or from prior exposure during pre-training. We present LiveCLKTBench, an automated generation pipeline specifically designed to isolate and measure cross-lingual knowledge transfer. Our pipeline identifies self-contained, time-sensitive knowledge entities from real-world domains, filters them based on temporal occurrence, and verifies them against the model's knowledge. The documents of these valid entities are then used to generate factual questions, which are translated into multiple languages to evaluate transferability across linguistic boundaries. Using LiveCLKTBench, we evaluate several LLMs across five languages and observe that cross-lingual transfer is strongly influenced by linguistic distance and often asymmetric across language directions. While larger models improve transfer, the gains diminish with scale and vary across domains. These findings provide new insights into multilingual transfer and demonstrate the value of LiveCLKTBench as a reliable benchmark for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM经常生成流畅但事实错误的陈述，这是由于它们在上下文知识和参数知识之间分配注意力的方式存在问题。理解和引导这种内部行为对于可信部署和模型机制的科学可解释性至关重要。

Method: 引入COMPASS框架，通过上下文依赖分数(CRS)量化上下文依赖度，使用PID控制器动态调节注意力头，无需重新训练或多轮解码即可保持事实一致性。

Result: 在多个基准测试(HotpotQA、XSum、HaluEval、RAGTruth)上，COMPASS持续降低上下文幻觉率(绝对减少2.8%到5.8%)，并揭示了不同注意力头对证据对齐的贡献。

Conclusion: 反馈驱动的可解释性为科学理解LLM行为提供了一条途径，COMPASS展示了如何通过可解释的控制机制改善模型的事实一致性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate fluent but factually incorrect statements despite having access to relevant evidence, a failure mode rooted in how they allocate attention between contextual and parametric knowledge. Understanding and steering this internal behavior is key both for trustworthy deployment and for scientific interpretability of model mechanisms. We introduce COMPASS (Context-Modulated PID Attention Steering System), a lightweight, interpretable control framework that embeds a model-based feedback loop directly within decoding. COMPASS quantifies context reliance via a transparent metric, the Context Reliance Score (CRS), which serves as an online probe of how attention heads ground generation in evidence. Using this interpretable signal, a PID controller dynamically modulates attention heads to maintain factual consistency without retraining or multi-pass decoding. Across benchmarks (HotpotQA, XSum, HaluEval, RAGTruth), COMPASS consistently reduces contextual hallucination rates (2.8 to 5.8 percent absolute) while revealing how distinct attention heads contribute to evidence alignment. These results highlight feedback-driven interpretability as a pathway toward scientific understanding of LLM behavior.

Result: 韵律分割训练产生略微更清晰和声学自然的语音；自动分割创建更规则片段，手动分割引入更大变异性，有助于更自然的韵律；两种方法都能重现预期的核心重音模式，但韵律模型更接近自然预核心轮廓。

Conclusion: 韵律分割标注能提升语音合成的自然度和可懂度，手动分割在韵律自然性方面表现更优，所有数据集和模型已公开以支持可重复性研究。

Abstract: Spontaneous speech presents several challenges for speech synthesis, particularly in capturing the natural flow of conversation, including turn-taking, pauses, and disfluencies. Although speech synthesis systems have made significant progress in generating natural and intelligible speech, primarily through architectures that implicitly model prosodic features such as pitch, intensity, and duration, the construction of datasets with explicit prosodic segmentation and their impact on spontaneous speech synthesis remains largely unexplored. This paper evaluates the effects of manual and automatic prosodic segmentation annotations in Brazilian Portuguese on the quality of speech synthesized by a non-autoregressive model, FastSpeech 2. Experimental results show that training with prosodic segmentation produced slightly more intelligible and acoustically natural speech. While automatic segmentation tends to create more regular segments, manual prosodic segmentation introduces greater variability, which contributes to more natural prosody. Analysis of neutral declarative utterances showed that both training approaches reproduced the expected nuclear accent pattern, but the prosodic model aligned more closely with natural pre-nuclear contours. To support reproducibility and future research, all datasets, source codes, and trained models are publicly available under the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license.

TL;DR: 提出了NAMEGEn框架，通过多智能体优化解决中文起名任务中的多目标灵活性和解释复杂性挑战，无需训练即可生成创意名字并提供美学解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决创意自然语言生成中的两个主要挑战：(1) 多目标灵活性 - 用户需求个性化、细粒度且多元化；(2) 解释复杂性 - 需要理解隐含意义以增强用户感知。这些挑战在短文本生成中尤为突出。

Method: 提出NAMEGEn多智能体优化框架，通过目标提取、名字生成和评估的迭代交替过程来满足多样化需求。构建了17k+古典诗歌语料库增强美学性，并引入CBNames基准测试。

Result: 实验表明NAMEGEn能有效生成满足个性化需求的创意名字并提供有意义的解释，在六个基线方法上表现优越，且无需任何训练。

Conclusion: NAMEGEn框架成功解决了创意短文本生成中的多目标优化和解释生成问题，为类似CNLG任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Trained on diverse human-authored texts, Large Language Models (LLMs) unlocked the potential for Creative Natural Language Generation (CNLG), benefiting various applications like advertising and storytelling. Nevertheless, CNLG still remains difficult due to two main challenges. (1) Multi-objective flexibility: user requirements are often personalized, fine-grained, and pluralistic, which LLMs struggle to satisfy simultaneously; (2) Interpretive complexity: beyond generation, creativity also involves understanding and interpreting implicit meaning to enhance users' perception. These challenges significantly limit current methods, especially in short-form text generation, in generating creative and insightful content. To address this, we focus on Chinese baby naming, a representative short-form CNLG task requiring adherence to explicit user constraints (e.g., length, semantics, anthroponymy) while offering meaningful aesthetic explanations. We propose NAMeGEn, a novel multi-agent optimization framework that iteratively alternates between objective extraction, name generation, and evaluation to meet diverse requirements and generate accurate explanations. To support this task, we further construct a classical Chinese poetry corpus with 17k+ poems to enhance aesthetics, and introduce CBNames, a new benchmark with tailored metrics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NAMeGEn effectively generates creative names that meet diverse, personalized requirements while providing meaningful explanations, outperforming six baseline methods spanning various LLM backbones without any training.

Motivation: 由于社交媒体和电商的影响力日益增长，理解客户态度变得至关重要。现有基于词典和传统机器学习的方法在处理上下文细微差别和可扩展性方面不足，而深度学习在语义关系捕捉方面表现更好。

Method: 提出混合深度神经网络模型，结合双向门控循环单元(BGRU)和长短期记忆(LSTM)层，解决上下文细微差别、可扩展性和类别不平衡等挑战。

Result: HBGRU-LSTM模型在测试集上达到95%准确率，优于LSTM(93.06%)、CNN+LSTM(93.31%)和GRU+LSTM(92.20%)。负面情感召回率从不平衡数据集的86%提升到平衡数据集的96%，误分类损失从20.24%降至13.3%。

Conclusion: 所提出的混合BGRU-LSTM模型在情感分析任务中表现出色，具有更好的泛化能力和鲁棒性，能够更公平地进行情感分类。

Abstract: Understanding customer attitudes has become a critical component of decision-making due to the growing influence of social media and e-commerce. Text-based opinions are the most structured, hence playing an important role in sentiment analysis. Most of the existing methods, which include lexicon-based approaches and traditional machine learning techniques, are insufficient for handling contextual nuances and scalability. While the latter has limitations in model performance and generalization, deep learning (DL) has achieved improvement, especially on semantic relationship capturing with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The aim of the study is to enhance opinion mining by introducing a hybrid deep neural network model that combines a bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BGRU) and long short-term memory (LSTM) layers to improve sentiment analysis, particularly addressing challenges such as contextual nuance, scalability, and class imbalance. To substantiate the efficacy of the proposed model, we conducted comprehensive experiments utilizing benchmark datasets, encompassing IMDB movie critiques and Amazon product evaluations. The introduced hybrid BGRULSTM (HBGRU-LSTM) architecture attained a testing accuracy of 95%, exceeding the performance of traditional DL frameworks such as LSTM (93.06%), CNN+LSTM (93.31%), and GRU+LSTM (92.20%). Moreover, our model exhibited a noteworthy enhancement in recall for negative sentiments, escalating from 86% (unbalanced dataset) to 96% (balanced dataset), thereby ensuring a more equitable and just sentiment classification. Furthermore, the model diminished misclassification loss from 20.24% for unbalanced to 13.3% for balanced dataset, signifying enhanced generalization and resilience.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的因果注意力机制限制了从后向前令牌的信息流，降低了表示质量。现有方法通过预置单个摘要令牌会导致信息过度压缩，特别是在长文档中性能下降。

Method: HTP将输入分区为块，在每个后续块前预置块级摘要令牌，创建多个后向信息流路径；用均值池化替代最后令牌池化以解决读取级过度压缩。

Result: 在11个检索数据集和30个通用嵌入基准测试中实现一致性能提升，尤其在长上下文设置中表现优异。

Conclusion: HTP作为一种简单、架构无关的方法，增强了零样本和微调模型，为优质长文档嵌入提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: Large language models produce powerful text embeddings, but their causal attention mechanism restricts the flow of information from later to earlier tokens, degrading representation quality. While recent methods attempt to solve this by prepending a single summary token, they over-compress information, hence harming performance on long documents. We propose Hierarchical Token Prepending (HTP), a method that resolves two critical bottlenecks. To mitigate attention-level compression, HTP partitions the input into blocks and prepends block-level summary tokens to subsequent blocks, creating multiple pathways for backward information flow. To address readout-level over-squashing, we replace last-token pooling with mean-pooling, a choice supported by theoretical analysis. HTP achieves consistent performance gains across 11 retrieval datasets and 30 general embedding benchmarks, especially in long-context settings. As a simple, architecture-agnostic method, HTP enhances both zero-shot and finetuned models, offering a scalable route to superior long-document embeddings.

In this work, we present a mathematically grounded framework to understand, measure, and mitigate these hallucinations. Drawing on probabilistic modeling, information theory, trigonometric signal analysis, and Bayesian uncertainty estimation, we analyze how errors compound autoregressively, propose refined uncertainty metrics, including semantic and phase-aware variants, and develop principled mitigation strategies such as contrastive decoding, retrieval-augmented grounding, factual alignment, and abstention. This unified lens connects recent advances in calibration, retrieval, and alignment to support safer and more reliable LLMs.

Conclusion: 在基于LLM的辅导系统中建模时间遗忘和学习者画像至关重要，TASA框架证明了这种整合的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into intelligent tutoring systems to provide human-like and adaptive instruction. However, most existing approaches fail to capture how students' knowledge evolves dynamically across their proficiencies, conceptual gaps, and forgetting patterns. This challenge is particularly acute in mathematics tutoring, where effective instruction requires fine-grained scaffolding precisely calibrated to each student's mastery level and cognitive retention. To address this issue, we propose TASA (Teaching According to Students' Aptitude), a student-aware tutoring framework that integrates persona, memory, and forgetting dynamics for personalized mathematics learning. Specifically, TASA maintains a structured student persona capturing proficiency profiles and an event memory recording prior learning interactions. By incorporating a continuous forgetting curve with knowledge tracing, TASA dynamically updates each student's mastery state and generates contextually appropriate, difficulty-calibrated questions and explanations. Empirical results demonstrate that TASA achieves superior learning outcomes and more adaptive tutoring behavior compared to representative baselines, underscoring the importance of modeling temporal forgetting and learner profiles in LLM-based tutoring systems.

Motivation: 解决当前多语言VLM评估的四个主要局限：依赖未验证的自动翻译、任务/领域覆盖范围窄、样本量有限、缺乏文化和本地来源的问答数据。

Method: 开发半自动数据集创建框架，结合回译、过滤和人工验证；创建包含英语对齐样本的印地语和泰卢固语基准，包括适应英语数据集和本地新颖印度数据集。

Result: 在5个任务中，4个任务在印度语言上的表现比英语差，平均回归为印地语8.3分，泰卢固语5.5分。识别了多语言多模态理解中的常见失败模式。

Conclusion: 需要改进多语言多模态理解，特别是在印度语言上，当前模型在这些语言上的表现明显落后于英语。

Abstract: With nearly 1.5 billion people and more than 120 major languages, India represents one of the most diverse regions in the world. As multilingual Vision-Language Models (VLMs) gain prominence, robust evaluation methodologies are essential to drive progress toward equitable AI for low-resource languages. Current multilingual VLM evaluations suffer from four major limitations: reliance on unverified auto-translations, narrow task/domain coverage, limited sample sizes, and lack of cultural and natively sourced Question-Answering (QA). To address these gaps, we present a scalable framework to evaluate VLMs in Indian languages and compare it with performance in English. Using the framework, we generate HinTel-AlignBench, a benchmark that draws from diverse sources in Hindi and Telugu with English-aligned samples. Our contributions are threefold: (1) a semi-automated dataset creation framework combining back-translation, filtering, and human verification; (2) the most comprehensive vision-language benchmark for Hindi and and Telugu, including adapted English datasets (VQAv2, RealWorldQA, CLEVR-Math) and native novel Indic datasets (JEE for STEM, VAANI for cultural grounding) with approximately 4,000 QA pairs per language; and (3) a detailed performance analysis of various State-of-the-Art (SOTA) open-weight and closed-source VLMs. We find a regression in performance for tasks in English versus in Indian languages for 4 out of 5 tasks across all the models, with an average regression of 8.3 points in Hindi and 5.5 points for Telugu. We categorize common failure modes to highlight concrete areas of improvement in multilingual multimodal understanding.

TL;DR: 本文首次全面研究将内在维度与可解释的文本属性关联，发现ID与熵度量互补，呈现明显的体裁分层（科学文本ID低，创意文本ID高），并通过稀疏自编码器识别了影响ID的因果特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内在维度是现代LLM分析的重要工具，但其文本决定因素尚未得到充分探索。本文旨在通过可解释的文本属性来理解ID的成因。

Method: 使用交叉编码器分析、语言特征和稀疏自编码器（SAEs）进行多角度研究，包括相关性分析、体裁分类和因果特征识别。

Result: 发现ID与熵度量正交，科学文本ID约8，百科内容约9，创意/观点写作约10.5；通过SAEs识别出科学信号降低ID，人性化信号增加ID，并通过转向实验证实因果性。

Conclusion: 当代模型认为科学写作相对"简单"，而小说、观点和情感内容增加了表示自由度，为ID的正确使用和基于ID结果的合理解释提供了实践指导。

Abstract: Intrinsic dimension (ID) is an important tool in modern LLM analysis, informing studies of training dynamics, scaling behavior, and dataset structure, yet its textual determinants remain underexplored. We provide the first comprehensive study grounding ID in interpretable text properties through cross-encoder analysis, linguistic features, and sparse autoencoders (SAEs). In this work, we establish three key findings. First, ID is complementary to entropy-based metrics: after controlling for length, the two are uncorrelated, with ID capturing geometric complexity orthogonal to prediction quality. Second, ID exhibits robust genre stratification: scientific prose shows low ID (~8), encyclopedic content medium ID (~9), and creative/opinion writing high ID (~10.5) across all models tested. This reveals that contemporary LLMs find scientific text "representationally simple" while fiction requires additional degrees of freedom. Third, using SAEs, we identify causal features: scientific signals (formal tone, report templates, statistics) reduce ID; humanized signals (personalization, emotion, narrative) increase it. Steering experiments confirm these effects are causal. Thus, for contemporary models, scientific writing appears comparatively "easy", whereas fiction, opinion, and affect add representational degrees of freedom. Our multi-faceted analysis provides practical guidance for the proper use of ID and the sound interpretation of ID-based results.

Motivation: 航空维修技术人员30%的工作时间都花在查找手册上，这是MRO操作中的效率瓶颈，而所有程序都必须追溯到认证来源。

Method: 构建了版本鲁棒的嵌入向量，使用ATA章节层次结构，并通过视觉语言解析来结构化认证内容，允许技术人员预览排名任务并在现有查看器中访问验证程序。

Result: 在49k合成查询上实现>90%检索准确率，双语对照研究显示90.9%的top-10成功率，查找时间减少95%（从6-15分钟降至18秒）。

Conclusion: 语义检索可以在严格监管约束下运行，并显著减少现实世界多语言MRO工作流程中的操作工作量。

Abstract: Aircraft Maintenance Technicians (AMTs) spend up to 30% of work time searching manuals, a documented efficiency bottleneck in MRO operations where every procedure must be traceable to certified sources. We present a compliance-preserving retrieval system that adapts LLM reranking and semantic search to aviation MRO environments by operating alongside, rather than replacing, certified legacy viewers. The system constructs revision-robust embeddings from ATA chapter hierarchies and uses vision-language parsing to structure certified content, allowing technicians to preview ranked tasks and access verified procedures in existing viewers. Evaluation on 49k synthetic queries achieves >90% retrieval accuracy, while bilingual controlled studies with 10 licensed AMTs demonstrate 90.9% top-10 success rate and 95% reduction in lookup time, from 6-15 minutes to 18 seconds per task. These gains provide concrete evidence that semantic retrieval can operate within strict regulatory constraints and meaningfully reduce operational workload in real-world multilingual MRO workflows.

Motivation: 监督式临床NER模型需要昂贵的标注数据，而现有的零样本NER方法在示例选择粒度和提示集成方面存在不足。

Method: 提出OEMA框架，包含三个组件：自标注器生成示例、鉴别器通过SNOMED CT过滤示例、预测器使用实体描述进行准确推理。

Result: 在MTSamples和VAERS数据集上，OEMA实现了最先进的精确匹配性能；在相关匹配下，性能与监督式BioClinicalBERT相当，并超过CRF。

Conclusion: OEMA通过本体引导推理和多智能体协作解决了零样本NER的关键挑战，实现了接近监督学习的性能，在临床NLP应用中具有前景。

Abstract: Clinical named entity recognition (NER) is crucial for extracting information from electronic health records (EHRs), but supervised models like CRF and BioClinicalBERT require costly annotated data. While zero-shot NER with large language models (LLMs) reduces this dependency, it struggles with example selection granularity and integrating prompts with self-improvement. To address this, we propose OEMA, a zero-shot clinical NER framework using multi-agent collaboration. OEMA's three components are: a self-annotator generating examples, a discriminator filtering them via SNOMED CT, and a predictor using entity descriptions for accurate inference. On MTSamples and VAERS datasets, OEMA achieves state-of-the-art exact-match performance. Under related-match, it matches supervised BioClinicalBERT and surpasses CRF. OEMA addresses key zero-shot NER challenges through ontology-guided reasoning and multi-agent collaboration, achieving near-supervised performance and showing promise for clinical NLP applications.

TL;DR: 提出C3上下文级联压缩方法，通过大小两个LLM级联处理长文本压缩和解码任务，在20倍压缩比下达到98%解码准确率，显著优于DeepSeek-OCR的60%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决百万级token长上下文任务中LLM面临的计算和内存挑战，探索文本压缩的上限。

Method: 采用级联架构：小型LLM作为第一阶段将长文本压缩为少量潜在token（如32或64长度），大型LLM作为第二阶段在压缩上下文中执行解码任务。

Result: 20倍压缩比下解码准确率达98%（DeepSeek-OCR约60%），40倍压缩比下仍保持约93%准确率。

Conclusion: C3压缩在上下文压缩领域表现出优越性能和可行性，为光学字符压缩、OCR等领域提供了潜在压缩比上限参考。

Abstract: Million-level token inputs in long-context tasks pose significant computational and memory challenges for Large Language Models (LLMs). Recently, DeepSeek-OCR conducted research into the feasibility of Contexts Optical Compression and achieved preliminary results. Inspired by this, we introduce Context Cascade Compression C3 to explore the upper limits of text compression. Our method cascades two LLMs of different sizes to handle the compression and decoding tasks. Specifically, a small LLM, acting as the first stage, performs text compression by condensing a long context into a set of latent tokens (e.g., 32 or 64 in length), achieving a high ratio of text tokens to latent tokens. A large LLM, as the second stage, then executes the decoding task on this compressed context. Experiments show that at a 20x compression ratio (where the number of text tokens is 20 times the number of latent tokens), our model achieves 98% decoding accuracy, compared to approximately 60% for DeepSeek-OCR. When we further increase the compression ratio to 40x, the accuracy is maintained at around 93%. This indicates that in the domain of context compression, C3 Compression demonstrates superior performance and feasibility over optical character compression. C3 uses a simpler, pure-text pipeline that ignores factors like layout, color, and information loss from a visual encoder. This also suggests a potential upper bound for compression ratios in future work on optical character compression, OCR, and related fields.

Abstract: We present evidence that adversarial poetry functions as a universal single-turn jailbreak technique for large language models (LLMs). Across 25 frontier proprietary and open-weight models, curated poetic prompts yielded high attack-success rates (ASR), with some providers exceeding 90%. Mapping prompts to MLCommons and EU CoP risk taxonomies shows that poetic attacks transfer across CBRN, manipulation, cyber-offence, and loss-of-control domains. Converting 1,200 MLCommons harmful prompts into verse via a standardized meta-prompt produced ASRs up to 18 times higher than their prose baselines. Outputs are evaluated using an ensemble of open-weight judge models and a human-validated stratified subset (with double-annotations to measure agreement). Disagreements were manually resolved. Poetic framing achieved an average jailbreak success rate of 62% for hand-crafted poems and approximately 43% for meta-prompt conversions (compared to non-poetic baselines), substantially outperforming non-poetic baselines and revealing a systematic vulnerability across model families and safety training approaches. These findings demonstrate that stylistic variation alone can circumvent contemporary safety mechanisms, suggesting fundamental limitations in current alignment methods and evaluation protocols.

Abstract: We introduce HEAD-QA v2, an expanded and updated version of a Spanish/English healthcare multiple-choice reasoning dataset originally released by Vilares and Gómez-Rodríguez (2019). The update responds to the growing need for high-quality datasets that capture the linguistic and conceptual complexity of healthcare reasoning. We extend the dataset to over 12,000 questions from ten years of Spanish professional exams, benchmark several open-source LLMs using prompting, RAG, and probability-based answer selection, and provide additional multilingual versions to support future work. Results indicate that performance is mainly driven by model scale and intrinsic reasoning ability, with complex inference strategies obtaining limited gains. Together, these results establish HEAD-QA v2 as a reliable resource for advancing research on biomedical reasoning and model improvement.

Motivation: 当前LLM代理推理能力提升往往导致思维链过长，影响实际场景的交互效率，但缺乏系统性的效率定义阻碍了针对性改进。

Method: 提出双效率定义（步骤级和轨迹级效率），并开发DEPO方法，通过偏好优化联合奖励简洁响应和更少行动步骤。

Result: 在WebShop和BabyAI上，DEPO减少令牌使用达60.9%，步骤减少26.9%，性能提升29.3%。在三个数学基准测试中保持泛化能力，仅用25%数据训练仍保持效率增益。

Conclusion: DEPO有效解决了LLM代理效率问题，在保持性能的同时显著提升效率，具有良好的泛化性和数据效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved their reasoning and decision-making abilities when deployed as agents. Richer reasoning, however, often comes at the cost of longer chain of thought (CoT), hampering interaction efficiency in real-world scenarios. Nevertheless, there still lacks systematic definition of LLM agent efficiency, hindering targeted improvements. To this end, we introduce dual-efficiency, comprising (i) step-level efficiency, which minimizes tokens per step, and (ii) trajectory-level efficiency, which minimizes the number of steps to complete a task. Building on this definition, we propose DEPO, a dual-efficiency preference optimization method that jointly rewards succinct responses and fewer action steps. Experiments on WebShop and BabyAI show that DEPO cuts token usage by up to 60.9% and steps by up to 26.9%, while achieving up to a 29.3% improvement in performance. DEPO also generalizes to three out-of-domain math benchmarks and retains its efficiency gains when trained on only 25% of the data. Our project page is at https://opencausalab.github.io/DEPO.

Abstract: This paper describes the systems developed by SPRING Lab, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, for the ASRU MADASR 2.0 challenge. The systems developed focuses on adapting ASR systems to improve in predicting the language and dialect of the utterance among 8 languages across 33 dialects. We participated in Track 1 and Track 2, which restricts the use of additional data and develop from-the-scratch multilingual systems. We presented a novel training approach using Multi-Decoder architecture with phonemic Common Label Set (CLS) as intermediate representation. It improved the performance over the baseline (in the CLS space). We also discuss various methods used to retain the gain obtained in the phonemic space while converting them back to the corresponding grapheme representations. Our systems beat the baseline in 3 languages (Track 2) in terms of WER/CER and achieved the highest language ID and dialect ID accuracy among all participating teams (Track 2).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在文本聚类中存在两个根本限制：缺乏状态记忆用于迭代优化，以及难以管理聚类粒度。现有方法依赖复杂的外部模块流水线，无法实现真正的端到端方法。

Method: 提出LLM-MemCluster框架，将聚类重新定义为完全LLM原生的任务。采用动态内存实现状态感知，双提示策略让模型能够推理并确定聚类数量。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的评估表明，这个无需调优的框架显著且持续地超越了强基线方法。

Conclusion: LLM-MemCluster为基于LLM的文本聚类提供了一个有效、可解释且真正端到端的范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping unsupervised learning by offering an unprecedented ability to perform text clustering based on their deep semantic understanding. However, their direct application is fundamentally limited by a lack of stateful memory for iterative refinement and the difficulty of managing cluster granularity. As a result, existing methods often rely on complex pipelines with external modules, sacrificing a truly end-to-end approach. We introduce LLM-MemCluster, a novel framework that reconceptualizes clustering as a fully LLM-native task. It leverages a Dynamic Memory to instill state awareness and a Dual-Prompt Strategy to enable the model to reason about and determine the number of clusters. Evaluated on several benchmark datasets, our tuning-free framework significantly and consistently outperforms strong baselines. LLM-MemCluster presents an effective, interpretable, and truly end-to-end paradigm for LLM-based text clustering.

Result: 建立了端到端的语言数据处理流程，确保方法透明性和可复现性

Conclusion: LPDS和pelican nlp共同为语言处理研究提供了标准化的解决方案

Abstract: The introduction of large language models and other influential developments in AI-based language processing have led to an evolution in the methods available to quantitatively analyse language data. With the resultant growth of attention on language processing, significant challenges have emerged, including the lack of standardisation in organising and sharing linguistic data and the absence of standardised and reproducible processing methodologies. Striving for future standardisation, we first propose the Language Processing Data Structure (LPDS), a data structure inspired by the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a widely adopted standard for handling neuroscience data. It provides a folder structure and file naming conventions for linguistic research. Second, we introduce pelican nlp, a modular and extensible Python package designed to enable streamlined language processing, from initial data cleaning and task-specific preprocessing to the extraction of sophisticated linguistic and acoustic features, such as semantic embeddings and prosodic metrics. The entire processing workflow can be specified within a single, shareable configuration file, which pelican nlp then executes on LPDS-formatted data. Depending on the specifications, the reproducible output can consist of preprocessed language data or standardised extraction of both linguistic and acoustic features and corresponding result aggregations. LPDS and pelican nlp collectively offer an end-to-end processing pipeline for linguistic data, designed to ensure methodological transparency and enhance reproducibility.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are currently at the center of research attention, showing rapid progress in scale and capabilities, yet their intelligence, limitations, and risks remain insufficiently understood. To address these issues, particularly in the context of the Russian language, where no multimodal benchmarks currently exist, we introduce Mera Multi, an open multimodal evaluation framework for Russian-spoken architectures. The benchmark is instruction-based and encompasses default text, image, audio, and video modalities, comprising 18 newly constructed evaluation tasks for both general-purpose models and modality-specific architectures (image-to-text, video-to-text, and audio-to-text). Our contributions include: (i) a universal taxonomy of multimodal abilities; (ii) 18 datasets created entirely from scratch with attention to Russian cultural and linguistic specificity, unified prompts, and metrics; (iii) baseline results for both closed-source and open-source models; (iv) a methodology for preventing benchmark leakage, including watermarking and licenses for private sets. While our current focus is on Russian, the proposed benchmark provides a replicable methodology for constructing multimodal benchmarks in typologically diverse languages, particularly within the Slavic language family.

Abstract: Language acquisition is vital to revealing the nature of human language intelligence and has recently emerged as a promising perspective for improving the interpretability of large language models (LLMs). However, it is ethically and practically infeasible to conduct experiments that require controlling human learners' language inputs. This poses challenges for the verifiability and scalability of language acquisition modeling, particularly in Chinese second language acquisition (SLA). While LLMs provide a controllable and reproducible alternative, a systematic benchmark to support phase-wise modeling and assessment is still lacking. In this paper, we present HSKBenchmark, the first benchmark for staged modeling and writing assessment of LLMs in Chinese SLA. It covers HSK levels 3 to 6 and includes authentic textbooks with 6.76 million tokens, 16K synthetic instruction samples, 30 test topics, and a linguistically grounded evaluation system. To simulate human learning trajectories, we introduce a curriculum-tuning framework that trains models from beginner to advanced levels. An evaluation system is created to examine level-based grammar coverage, writing errors, lexical and syntactic complexity, and holistic scoring. We also build HSKAgent, fine-tuned on 10K learner compositions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that HSKBenchmark not only models Chinese SLA effectively, but also serves as a reliable benchmark for dynamic writing assessment in LLMs. Our fine-tuned LLMs have writing performance on par with advanced human learners and exhibit human-like acquisition characteristics. The HSKBenchmark, HSKAgent, and checkpoints serve as foundational tools and resources, with the potential to pave the way for future research on language acquisition modeling and LLMs interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究假设分词应用于无界大字母表，但实际分词器在固定大小字母表（如字节或Unicode字符）上运行。本文旨在填补这一空白，分析有界n元字母表下的分词问题。

Method: 分析两种自然变体：自底向上分词和直接分词，分别考虑选择合并操作序列或词汇表来最优压缩数据集。证明对于n元字母表的硬度结果适用于任何更大尺寸的字母表。

Result: 即使使用二进制字母表，两种分词变体不仅是NP完全的，而且不存在多项式时间近似方案（除非P=NP）。直接分词在一元字母表下仍然是NP完全的。

Conclusion: 分词的计算难处理性不是大字母表或复杂构造的产物，而是基本障碍。这解释了为什么BPE和UnigramLM等实用算法是启发式的，并指出近似算法是分词研究的重要方向。

Abstract: Recent works have shown that tokenisation is NP-complete. However, these works assume tokenisation is applied to inputs with unboundedly large alphabets -- an unrealistic assumption, given that in practice tokenisers operate over fixed-size alphabets, such as bytes or Unicode characters. We close this gap by analysing tokenisation over bounded $n$-ary alphabets, considering two natural variants: bottom-up tokenisation and direct tokenisation, where we must, respectively, select a sequence of merge operations or a vocabulary whose application optimally compresses a dataset. First, we note that proving hardness results for an $n$-ary alphabet proves the same results for alphabets of any larger size. We then prove that even with binary alphabets, both variants are not only NP-complete, but admit no polynomial-time approximation scheme (unless P=NP). We further show that direct tokenisation remains NP-complete even when applied to unary alphabets. While unary alphabets may not be practically useful, this result establishes that the computational intractability of tokenisation is not an artifact of large alphabets or complex constructions, but a fundamental barrier. Overall, our results explain why practical algorithms such as BPE and UnigramLM are heuristic, and points toward approximation algorithms being an important path going forward for tokenisation research.

Abstract: Chart editing reduces manual effort in visualization design. Typical benchmarks limited in data diversity and assume access to complete chart code, which is seldom in real-world scenarios. To address this gap, we present ChartEditVista, a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 7,964 samples spanning 31 chart categories. It encompasses diverse editing instructions and covers nearly all editable chart elements. The inputs in ChartEditVista include only the original chart image and natural language editing instructions, without the original chart codes. ChartEditVista is generated through a fully automated pipeline that produces, edits, and verifies charts, ensuring high-quality chart editing data. Besides, we introduce two novel fine-grained, rule-based evaluation metrics: the layout metric, which evaluates the position, size and color of graphical components; and the text metric, which jointly assesses textual content and font styling. Building on top of ChartEditVista, we present ChartEditor, a model trained using a reinforcement learning framework that incorporates a novel rendering reward to simultaneously enforce code executability and visual fidelity. Through extensive experiments and human evaluations, we demonstrate that ChartEditVista provides a robust evaluation, while ChartEditor consistently outperforms models with similar-scale and larger-scale on chart editing tasks.

Conclusion: 将多尺度特征映射明确纳入储层计算架构对于建模具有内在快慢相互作用的复杂动力系统是有效的。

Abstract: Forecasting nonlinear time series with multi-scale temporal structures remains a central challenge in complex systems modeling. We present a novel reservoir computing framework that combines delay embedding with random Fourier feature (RFF) mappings to capture such dynamics. Two formulations are investigated: a single-scale RFF reservoir, which employs a fixed kernel bandwidth, and a multi-scale RFF reservoir, which integrates multiple bandwidths to represent both fast and slow temporal dependencies. The framework is applied to a diverse set of canonical systems: neuronal models such as the Rulkov map, Izhikevich model, Hindmarsh-Rose model, and Morris-Lecar model, which exhibit spiking, bursting, and chaotic behaviors arising from fast-slow interactions; and ecological models including the predator-prey dynamics and Ricker map with seasonal forcing, which display multi-scale oscillations and intermittency. Across all cases, the multi-scale RFF reservoir consistently outperforms its single-scale counterpart, achieving lower normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) and more robust long-horizon predictions. These results highlight the effectiveness of explicitly incorporating multi-scale feature mappings into reservoir computing architectures for modeling complex dynamical systems with intrinsic fast-slow interactions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Evolutionary multitasking (EMT) algorithms typically require tailored designs for knowledge transfer, in order to assure convergence and optimality in multitask optimization. In this paper, we explore designing a systematic and generalizable knowledge transfer policy through Reinforcement Learning. We first identify three major challenges: determining the task to transfer (where), the knowledge to be transferred (what) and the mechanism for the transfer (how). To address these challenges, we formulate a multi-role RL system where three (groups of) policy networks act as specialized agents: a task routing agent incorporates an attention-based similarity recognition module to determine source-target transfer pairs via attention scores; a knowledge control agent determines the proportion of elite solutions to transfer; and a group of strategy adaptation agents control transfer strength by dynamically controlling hyper-parameters in the underlying EMT framework. Through pre-training all network modules end-to-end over an augmented multitask problem distribution, a generalizable meta-policy is obtained. Comprehensive validation experiments show state-of-the-art performance of our method against representative baselines. Further in-depth analysis not only reveals the rationale behind our proposal but also provide insightful interpretations on what the system have learned.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的神经网络逼近范式：为每个目标函数构建一个具有固定拓扑和权重的单一RNN，通过增加运行时间步数而非改变网络结构来实现任意精度的逼近。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络逼近方法需要为每个误差容忍度构建不同的网络，本文旨在开发一种固定结构的RNN，通过时间计算和权重共享实现逼近误差随运行时间指数衰减。

Method: 采用时间计算和权重共享机制，构建具有固定拓扑的RNN，通过增加运行步数而非网络深度来降低逼近误差。针对一元多项式，借鉴深度前馈ReLU网络的结构演算原理。

Result: 构建的RNN大小与误差容忍度ε无关，隐藏状态维度与多项式次数呈线性关系，实现了逼近误差随运行时间指数衰减。

Conclusion: 该新范式特别适用于内存稀缺但运行时间相对廉价的硬件实现，为神经网络逼近理论开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Classical neural network approximation results take the form: for every function $f$ and every error tolerance $ε> 0$, one constructs a neural network whose architecture and weights depend on $ε$. This paper introduces a fundamentally different approximation paradigm that reverses this quantifier order. For each target function $f$, we construct a single recurrent neural network (RNN) with fixed topology and fixed weights that approximates $f$ to within any prescribed tolerance $ε> 0$ when run for sufficiently many time steps.
  The key mechanism enabling this quantifier reversal is temporal computation combined with weight sharing: rather than increasing network depth, the approximation error is reduced solely by running the RNN longer. This yields exponentially decaying approximation error as a function of runtime while requiring storage of only a small, fixed set of weights. Such architectures are appealing for hardware implementations where memory is scarce and runtime is comparatively inexpensive.
  To initiate the systematic development of this novel approximation paradigm, we focus on univariate polynomials. Our RNN constructions emulate the structural calculus underlying deep feed-forward ReLU network approximation theory -- parallelization, linear combinations, affine transformations, and, most importantly, a clocked mechanism that realizes function composition within a single recurrent architecture. The resulting RNNs have size independent of the error tolerance $ε$ and hidden-state dimension linear in the degree of the polynomial.

Specifically, we consider complicated functions with numerous local minima, as is often the case for real-world data mining losses. We do so by applying a model from theoretical physics to create an Ising model-based evolutionary optimization algorithm. Our algorithm creates stable regions of local optima and a high potential for improvement between these regions. This enables the accurate identification of global minima, surpassing comparable methods, and has promising applications to ensembles.

Abstract: Surrogate-Assisted Evolutionary Algorithms (SAEAs) are widely used for expensive Black-Box Optimization. However, their reliance on rigid, manually designed components such as infill criteria and evolutionary strategies during the search process limits their flexibility across tasks. To address these limitations, we propose Dual-Control Bi-Space Surrogate-Assisted Evolutionary Algorithm (DB-SAEA), a Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) framework tailored for multi-objective problems. DB-SAEA learns a meta-policy that jointly regulates candidate generation and infill criterion selection, enabling dual control. The bi-space Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) module in DB-SAEA adopts an attention-based architecture to capture optimization states from both true and surrogate evaluation spaces, while ensuring scalability across problem dimensions, population sizes, and objectives. Additionally, we integrate TabPFN as the surrogate model for accurate and efficient prediction with uncertainty estimation. The framework is trained via reinforcement learning, leveraging parallel sampling and centralized training to enhance efficiency and transferability across tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that DB-SAEA not only outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse benchmarks, but also exhibits strong zero-shot transfer to unseen tasks with higher-dimensional settings. This work introduces the first MetaBBO framework with dual-level control over SAEAs and a bi-space ELA that captures surrogate model information.

Motivation: 现有算法在计算加权多数游戏中的权力指数时效率较低，特别是在配额q较小时。需要开发更快的算法来处理这类计算问题。

Method: 利用形式幂级数的高效计算技术，设计了两种算法：Banzhaf指数计算算法时间复杂度为O(n+q log(q))，Shapley-Shubik指数计算算法时间复杂度为O(nq log(q))。

Result: 当q=2^{o(n)}时，新算法比现有算法更快。Banzhaf指数可在O(n+q log(q))时间内计算所有玩家的指数，Shapley-Shubik指数可在O(nq log(q))时间内计算。

Conclusion: 通过形式幂级数的高效计算技术，成功开发了计算权力指数的快速伪多项式时间算法，显著提高了计算效率。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose fast pseudo-polynomial-time algorithms for computing power indices in weighted majority games. We show that we can compute the Banzhaf index for all players in $O(n+q\log (q))$ time, where $n$ is the number of players and $q$ is a given quota. Moreover, we prove that the Shapley--Shubik index for all players can be computed in $O(nq\log (q))$ time. Our algorithms are faster than existing algorithms when $q=2^{o(n)}$. Our algorithms exploit efficient computation techniques for formal power series.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 将合作竞争指数从简单博弈扩展到单调TU博弈和所有非空联盟，定义了绝对合作竞争指数，范围在[-1,1]内，便于跨联盟比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展合作竞争指数的适用范围，使其能用于更广泛的单调TU博弈和所有非空联盟，包括单元素联盟，以提供更通用的分析工具。

Method: 研究Banzhaf、Uniform Shapley和Shapley-Owen合作竞争指数等实例，推导与经典半值连接的显式公式，并提供Uniform Shapley和Shapley-Owen版本的公理化特征。

Result: 定义了具有通用范围[-1,1]的绝对合作竞争指数，建立了合作竞争与经典半值的联系，并通过公理特征证明了特定版本的唯一性。

Conclusion: 合作竞争指数成为量化TU博弈中联盟合作与竞争倾向的通用工具，通过公理化特征确立了其理论基础。

Abstract: We extend the coopetition index introduced by Aleandri and Dall'Aglio (2025) for simple games to the broader class of monotone transferable utility (TU) games and to all non-empty coalitions, including singletons. The new formulation allows us to define an absolute coopetition index with a universal range in [-1,1], facilitating meaningful comparisons across coalitions.
  We study several notable instances of the index, including the Banzhaf, Uniform Shapley, and Shapley-Owen coopetition indices, and we derive explicit formulas that connect coopetition to classical semivalues. Finally, we provide axiomatic characterizations of the Uniform Shapley and Shaple--Owen versions, showing that each is uniquely determined by linearity, symmetry over pure bargaining games, external null player neutrality, and a contraction axiom reflecting its internal distribution. These results position the coopetition index as a versatile tool for quantifying the cooperative and competitive tendencies of coalitions in TU-games.

Conclusion: 所提出的情景方法能够有效分析非凸非凹极小极大问题的概率鲁棒性，无需依赖非退化假设。

Abstract: This paper investigates probabilistic robustness of nonconvex-nonconcave minimax problems via the scenario approach. Inspired by recent advances in scenario optimization (Garatti and Campi, 2025), we obtain robustness results for key equilibria with nonconvex-nonconcave payoffs, overcoming the dependence on the non-degeneracy assumption. Specifically, under convex strategy sets for all players, we first establish a probabilistic robustness guarantee for an epsilon-stationary point by proving the monotonicity of the stationary residual in the number of scenarios. Moreover, under nonconvex strategy sets for all players, we derive a probabilistic robustness guarantee for a global minimax point by invoking the extreme value theorem and Berge's maximum theorem. A numerical experiment on a unit commitment problem corroborates our theoretical findings.

Conclusion: 基于知识蒸馏的MIA范式能够有效提升在LLM推荐系统中的成员推理攻击效果，解决了传统方法中影子模型构建困难的问题。

Abstract: Membership Inference Attack (MIA) aims to determine if a data sample is used in the training dataset of a target model. Traditional MIA obtains feature of target model via shadow models and uses the feature to train attack model, but the scale and complexity of training or fine-tuning data for large language model (LLM)-based recommendation systems make shadow models difficult to construct. Knowledge distillation as a method for extracting knowledge contributes to construct a stronger reference model. Knowledge distillation enables separate distillation for member and non-member data during the distillation process, enhancing the model's discriminative capability between the two in MIA. This paper propose a knowledge distillation-based MIA paradigm to improve the performance of membership inference attacks on LLM-based recommendation systems. Our paradigm introduces knowledge distillation to obtain a reference model, which enhances the reference model's ability to distinguish between member and non-member data. We obtain individual features from the reference model and train our attack model with fused feature. Our paradigm improves the attack performance of MIA compared to shadow model-based attack.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming personalized search, recommendations, and customer interaction in e-commerce. Customers increasingly shop across multiple devices, from voice-only assistants to multimodal displays, each offering different input and output capabilities. A proactive suggestion to switch devices can greatly improve the user experience, but it must be offered with high precision to avoid unnecessary friction. We address the challenge of predicting when a query requires visual augmentation and a cross-device switch to improve product discovery. We introduce Image-Seeking Intent Prediction, a novel task for LLM-driven e-commerce assistants that anticipates when a spoken product query should proactively trigger a visual on a screen-enabled device. Using large-scale production data from a multi-device retail assistant, including 900K voice queries, associated product retrievals, and behavioral signals such as image carousel engagement, we train IRP (Image Request Predictor), a model that leverages user input query and corresponding retrieved product metadata to anticipate visual intent. Our experiments show that combining query semantics with product data, particularly when improved through lightweight summarization, consistently improves prediction accuracy. Incorporating a differentiable precision-oriented loss further reduces false positives. These results highlight the potential of LLMs to power intelligent, cross-device shopping assistants that anticipate and adapt to user needs, enabling more seamless and personalized e-commerce experiences.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) represents a transformative approach within natural language processing (NLP), combining neural information retrieval with generative language modeling to enhance both contextual accuracy and factual reliability of responses. Unlike conventional Large Language Models (LLMs), which are constrained by static training corpora, RAG-powered systems dynamically integrate domain-specific external knowledge sources, thereby overcoming temporal and disciplinary limitations. In this study, we present the design and evaluation of a RAG-enabled system tailored for Mycophyto, with a focus on advancing agricultural applications related to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). These fungi play a critical role in sustainable agriculture by enhancing nutrient acquisition, improving plant resilience under abiotic and biotic stresses, and contributing to soil health. Our system operationalizes a dual-layered strategy: (i) semantic retrieval and augmentation of domain-specific content from agronomy and biotechnology corpora using vector embeddings, and (ii) structured data extraction to capture predefined experimental metadata such as inoculation methods, spore densities, soil parameters, and yield outcomes. This hybrid approach ensures that generated responses are not only semantically aligned but also supported by structured experimental evidence. To support scalability, embeddings are stored in a high-performance vector database, allowing near real-time retrieval from an evolving literature base. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed pipeline retrieves and synthesizes highly relevant information regarding AMF interactions with crop systems, such as tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). The framework underscores the potential of AI-driven knowledge discovery to accelerate agroecological innovation and enhance decision-making in sustainable farming systems.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: OTCR是一个基于任务中心视角的多模态信息提取框架，通过跨模态最优传输和变分信息瓶颈实现可控的多模态融合，在视觉丰富文档上取得了竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常假设模态等价或采用统一融合方式，导致多模态信号的无差别融合和任务无关冗余，限制了泛化能力。本文从任务中心视角重新审视MIE：文本应主导，视觉应选择性支持。

Method: 提出OTCR两阶段框架：1）跨模态最优传输生成文本token和视觉patch的稀疏概率对齐，通过上下文感知门控控制视觉注入；2）变分信息瓶颈压缩融合特征，过滤任务无关噪声，生成紧凑的任务自适应表示。

Result: 在FUNSD数据集上达到91.95% SER和91.13% RE，在XFUND(ZH)数据集上达到91.09% SER和94.20% RE，表现出跨数据集的竞争性能。特征级分析证实了模态冗余减少和任务信号增强。

Conclusion: 这项工作为文档AI中的可控多模态融合提供了一个可解释的、信息论范式的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Information Extraction (MIE) requires fusing text and visual cues from visually rich documents. While recent methods have advanced multimodal representation learning, most implicitly assume modality equivalence or treat modalities in a largely uniform manner, still relying on generic fusion paradigms. This often results in indiscriminate incorporation of multimodal signals and insufficient control over task-irrelevant redundancy, which may in turn limit generalization. We revisit MIE from a task-centric view: text should dominate, vision should selectively support. We present OTCR, a two-stage framework. First, Cross-modal Optimal Transport (OT) yields sparse, probabilistic alignments between text tokens and visual patches, with a context-aware gate controlling visual injection. Second, a Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) compresses fused features, filtering task-irrelevant noise to produce compact, task-adaptive representations. On FUNSD, OTCR achieves 91.95% SER and 91.13% RE, while on XFUND (ZH), it reaches 91.09% SER and 94.20% RE, demonstrating competitive performance across datasets. Feature-level analyses further confirm reduced modality redundancy and strengthened task signals. This work offers an interpretable, information-theoretic paradigm for controllable multimodal fusion in document AI.

TL;DR: 提出了ESMR框架，通过结合Transformer情感预测器和混合推荐策略，实现情感感知的社交媒体推荐，在保持用户参与度的同时改善情感健康。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有社交媒体推荐系统仅优化参与度指标，不考虑用户情感状态，长期接触情感化内容会对用户情感健康产生负面影响。

Method: ESMR框架：Transformer情感预测器 + 混合推荐策略（稳定期用LightGBM，持续负面情感时用带因果奖励的强化学习）。

Result: 30天交互轨迹评估显示：改善情感恢复、降低情感波动、保持强参与度。

Conclusion: ESMR提供了情感感知推荐路径，在不影响参与度性能的前提下关注用户情感健康。

Abstract: Social media recommendation systems play a central role in shaping users' emotional experiences. However, most systems are optimized solely for engagement metrics, such as click rate, viewing time, or scrolling, without accounting for users' emotional states. Repeated exposure to emotionally charged content has been shown to negatively affect users' emotional well-being over time. We propose an Emotion-aware Social Media Recommendation (ESMR) framework that personalizes content based on users' evolving emotional trajectories. ESMR integrates a Transformer-based emotion predictor with a hybrid recommendation policy: a LightGBM model for engagement during stable periods and a reinforcement learning agent with causally informed rewards when negative emotional states persist. Through behaviorally grounded evaluation over 30-day interaction traces, ESMR demonstrates improved emotional recovery, reduced volatility, and strong engagement retention. ESMR offers a path toward emotionally aware recommendations without compromising engagement performance.

TL;DR: CAR算法通过分析查询-文档相似度距离的聚类模式，动态确定最佳检索文档数量，解决了传统静态top-k检索无法适应不同查询特性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态top-k检索方法无法适应不同查询的特性：聚焦查询需要少量高度相关文档，而宽泛查询需要更多支持信息。静态方法会导致上下文不足或信息冗余。

Method: CAR算法通过分析查询-文档相似度距离的聚类模式，检测高度相关文档向不太相关候选文档的过渡点，建立自适应截断机制。

Result: 在Coinbase的CDP语料库和MultiHop-RAG基准测试中，CAR始终选择最佳检索深度，获得最高TES分数，优于所有固定top-k基线。在下游RAG评估中，CAR将LLM令牌使用减少60%，端到端延迟降低22%，幻觉减少10%，同时完全保持答案相关性。

Conclusion: CAR算法通过自适应检索深度显著提升了RAG系统的性能和效率，在Coinbase虚拟助手中的集成使用户参与度增加了200%。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by pulling in external material, document, code, manuals, from vast and ever-growing corpora, to effectively answer user queries. The effectiveness of RAG depends significantly on aligning the number of retrieved documents with query characteristics: narrowly focused queries typically require fewer, highly relevant documents, whereas broader or ambiguous queries benefit from retrieving more extensive supporting information. However, the common static top-k retrieval approach fails to adapt to this variability, resulting in either insufficient context from too few documents or redundant information from too many. Motivated by these challenges, we introduce Cluster-based Adaptive Retrieval (CAR), an algorithm that dynamically determines the optimal number of documents by analyzing the clustering patterns of ordered query-document similarity distances. CAR detects the transition point within similarity distances, where tightly clustered, highly relevant documents shift toward less pertinent candidates, establishing an adaptive cut-off that scales with query complexity. On Coinbase's CDP corpus and the public MultiHop-RAG benchmark, CAR consistently picks the optimal retrieval depth and achieves the highest TES score, outperforming every fixed top-k baseline. In downstream RAG evaluations, CAR cuts LLM token usage by 60%, trims end-to-end latency by 22%, and reduces hallucinations by 10% while fully preserving answer relevance. Since integrating CAR into Coinbase's virtual assistant, we've seen user engagement jump by 200%.

Abstract: Serving deep learning based recommendation models (DLRM) at scale is challenging. Existing systems rely on CPU-based ANN indexing and filtering services, suffering from non-negligible costs and forgoing joint optimization opportunities. Such inefficiency makes them difficult to support more complex model architectures, such as learned similarities and multi-task retrieval.
  In this paper, we propose SilverTorch, a model-based system for serving recommendation models on GPUs. SilverTorch unifies model serving by replacing standalone indexing and filtering services with layers of served models. We propose a Bloom index algorithm on GPUs for feature filtering and a tensor-native fused Int8 ANN kernel on GPUs for nearest neighbor search. We further co-design the ANN search index and filtering index to reduce GPU memory utilization and eliminate unnecessary computation. Benefit from SilverTorch's serving paradigm, we introduce a OverArch scoring layer and a Value Model to aggregate results across multi-tasks. These advancements improve the accuracy for retrieval and enable future studies for serving more complex models. For ranking, SilverTorch's design accelerates item embedding calculation by caching the pre-calculated embeddings inside the serving model.
  Our evaluation on the industry-scale datasets show that SilverTorch achieves up to 5.6x lower latency and 23.7x higher throughput compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. We also demonstrate that SilverTorch's solution is 13.35x more cost-efficient than CPU-based solution while improving accuracy via serving more complex models. SilverTorch serves over hundreds of models online across major products and recommends contents for billions of daily active users.

Conclusion: MACRec通过整合多模态信息到语义ID学习和生成模型训练中，显著提升了生成式推荐的性能

Abstract: Generative Recommendation (GR) has emerged as a new paradigm in recommender systems. This approach relies on quantized representations to discretize item features, modeling users' historical interactions as sequences of discrete tokens. Based on these tokenized sequences, GR predicts the next item by employing next-token prediction methods. The challenges of GR lie in constructing high-quality semantic identifiers (IDs) that are hierarchically organized, minimally conflicting, and conducive to effective generative model training. However, current approaches remain limited in their ability to harness multimodal information and to capture the deep and intricate interactions among diverse modalities, both of which are essential for learning high-quality semantic IDs and for effectively training GR models. To address this, we propose Multi-Aspect Cross-modal quantization for generative Recommendation (MACRec), which introduces multimodal information and incorporates it into both semantic ID learning and generative model training from different aspects. Specifically, we first introduce cross-modal quantization during the ID learning process, which effectively reduces conflict rates and thus improves codebook usability through the complementary integration of multimodal information. In addition, to further enhance the generative ability of our GR model, we incorporate multi-aspect cross-modal alignments, including the implicit and explicit alignments. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on three well-known recommendation datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been widely used as recommender systems, owing to their strong reasoning capability and their effectiveness in handling cold-start items. To better adapt LLMs for recommendation, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been incorporated. Most existing RAG methods are user-based, retrieving purchase patterns of users similar to the target user and providing them to the LLM. In this work, we propose ItemRAG, an item-based RAG method for LLM-based recommendation that retrieves relevant items (rather than users) from item-item co-purchase histories. ItemRAG helps LLMs capture co-purchase patterns among items, which are beneficial for recommendations. Especially, our retrieval strategy incorporates semantically similar items to better handle cold-start items and uses co-purchase frequencies to improve the relevance of the retrieved items. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ItemRAG consistently (1) improves the zero-shot LLM-based recommender by up to 43% in Hit-Ratio-1 and (2) outperforms user-based RAG baselines under both standard and cold-start item recommendation settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个去偏框架来解决计算机自适应测试中的选择偏差问题，通过交叉属性考生检索和选择性Mixup正则化来提升诊断模型的泛化能力和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CAT研究主要关注诊断准确性，但忽略了自适应过程中固有的选择偏差问题。这种偏差源于问题选择严重依赖于估计的能力水平，导致偏差在迭代更新中被放大，造成预测偏差和对齐问题。

Method: 提出包含两个关键模块的去偏框架：1）交叉属性考生检索，检索具有相对均匀正确和错误回答分布的平衡考生作为偏斜考生的中性参考；2）选择性Mixup正则化，在标签一致条件下对偏斜考生与其匹配的平衡对应项应用mixup，丰富偏差冲突样本的多样性并平滑选择边界。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法显著提升了CAT中问题选择的泛化能力和公平性。

Conclusion: 所提出的去偏框架有效解决了CAT中的选择偏差问题，通过平衡考生检索和Mixup正则化技术，显著提升了诊断模型的性能和公平性。

Abstract: Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) is a widely used technology for evaluating learners' proficiency in online education platforms. By leveraging prior estimates of proficiency to select questions and updating the estimates iteratively based on responses, CAT enables personalized learner modeling and has attracted substantial attention. Despite this progress, most existing works focus primarily on improving diagnostic accuracy, while overlooking the selection bias inherent in the adaptive process. Selection Bias arises because the question selection is strongly influenced by the estimated proficiency, such as assigning easier questions to learners with lower proficiency and harder ones to learners with higher proficiency. Since the selection depends on prior estimation, this bias propagates into the diagnosis model, which is further amplified during iterative updates, leading to misalignment and biased predictions. Moreover, the imbalanced nature of learners' historical interactions often exacerbates the bias in diagnosis models. To address this issue, we propose a debiasing framework consisting of two key modules: Cross-Attribute Examinee Retrieval and Selective Mixup-based Regularization. First, we retrieve balanced examinees with relatively even distributions of correct and incorrect responses and use them as neutral references for biased examinees. Then, mixup is applied between each biased examinee and its matched balanced counterpart under label consistency. This augmentation enriches the diversity of bias-conflicting samples and smooths selection boundaries. Finally, extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets with multiple advanced diagnosis models demonstrate that our method substantially improves both the generalization ability and fairness of question selection in CAT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖用户自身历史，忽视了用户间差异对个性化的重要性，且特征提取过程依赖固定维度和快速直觉推理，限制了差异覆盖范围和粒度。

Method: DRP框架通过推理扩展重构差异提取机制，自主识别相关差异特征维度，生成结构化定义和描述，实现基于系统2思维的慢速、深思熟虑的差异推理。

Result: 在个性化评论生成任务上的实验表明，DRP在多个指标上持续优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DRP通过引入系统2思维的差异推理机制，有效提升了LLM个性化性能，解决了现有方法在差异覆盖和粒度方面的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into users' daily lives, driving a growing demand for personalized outputs. Prior work has primarily leveraged a user's own history, often overlooking inter-user differences that are critical for effective personalization. While recent methods have attempted to model such differences, their feature extraction processes typically rely on fixed dimensions and quick, intuitive inference (System-1 thinking), limiting both the coverage and granularity of captured user differences. To address these limitations, we propose Difference-aware Reasoning Personalization (DRP), a framework that reconstructs the difference extraction mechanism by leveraging inference scaling to enhance LLM personalization. DRP autonomously identifies relevant difference feature dimensions and generates structured definitions and descriptions, enabling slow, deliberate reasoning (System-2 thinking) over user differences. Experiments on personalized review generation demonstrate that DRP consistently outperforms baseline methods across multiple metrics.

TL;DR: CroPS是一个新颖的检索数据引擎，通过引入多视角的多样化正样本来缓解密集检索中的过滤气泡效应，已在快手搜索平台部署并显著提升检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工业检索系统采用自增强训练管道，依赖历史用户交互数据进行监督，导致过滤气泡效应，将潜在相关但未被曝光的内容排除在训练信号之外，使模型偏向于狭窄和保守的检索。

Method: 提出CroPS框架，从三个层面引入多样化正样本：用户查询重构行为（查询层面）、推荐流中的互动数据（系统层面）、以及大语言模型合成的世界知识（知识层面）。采用分层标签分配策略和相应的H-InfoNCE损失函数实现细粒度、相关性感知的优化。

Result: 在快手搜索平台上的大量实验表明，CroPS在离线和在线A/B测试中均显著优于强基线方法，实现了更优的检索性能并降低了查询重构率。

Conclusion: CroPS成功解决了密集检索中的过滤气泡问题，通过多视角正样本增强训练，显著提升了检索系统的性能，目前已在快手搜索平台全面部署，为数亿用户提供服务。

Abstract: Dense retrieval has become a foundational paradigm in modern search systems, especially on short-video platforms. However, most industrial systems adopt a self-reinforcing training pipeline that relies on historically exposed user interactions for supervision. This paradigm inevitably leads to a filter bubble effect, where potentially relevant but previously unseen content is excluded from the training signal, biasing the model toward narrow and conservative retrieval. In this paper, we present CroPS (Cross-Perspective Positive Samples), a novel retrieval data engine designed to alleviate this problem by introducing diverse and semantically meaningful positive examples from multiple perspectives. CroPS enhances training with positive signals derived from user query reformulation behavior (query-level), engagement data in recommendation streams (system-level), and world knowledge synthesized by large language models (knowledge-level). To effectively utilize these heterogeneous signals, we introduce a Hierarchical Label Assignment (HLA) strategy and a corresponding H-InfoNCE loss that together enable fine-grained, relevance-aware optimization. Extensive experiments conducted on Kuaishou Search, a large-scale commercial short-video search platform, demonstrate that CroPS significantly outperforms strong baselines both offline and in live A/B tests, achieving superior retrieval performance and reducing query reformulation rates. CroPS is now fully deployed in Kuaishou Search, serving hundreds of millions of users daily.

### [155] [The Illusion of Procedural Reasoning: Measuring Long-Horizon FSM Execution in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14777)
*Mahdi Samiei,Mahdi Mansouri,Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了有限状态机(FSM)执行框架来评估LLMs的程序推理能力，发现随着任务复杂度增加，模型性能系统性下降，特别是高分支复杂度比长记忆跨度影响更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在形式化为推理问题的任务上表现优异，但其执行多步骤、基于规则计算的实际程序推理能力尚不明确，缺乏可控、可解释的基准来评估这种能力退化。

Method: 引入有限状态机执行作为最小化、完全可解释的评估框架，模型接收明确的FSM定义并逐步执行输入动作，在多轮次中保持状态一致性。

Result: 实证结果显示随着任务范围或分支复杂度增加，模型性能系统性下降。高分支复杂度的规则检索比长记忆跨度影响更大。大模型局部准确性提高但在多步骤推理中仍然脆弱，除非明确提示外部化中间步骤。

Conclusion: FSM评估为诊断LLMs失败模式提供了透明、复杂度可控的探针，有助于建立理解和改进LLMs算法可靠性的严格实验基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results on tasks framed as reasoning problems, yet their true ability to perform procedural reasoning, executing multi-step, rule-based computations remains unclear. Unlike algorithmic systems, which can deterministically execute long-horizon symbolic procedures, LLMs often degrade under extended reasoning chains, but there is no controlled, interpretable benchmark to isolate and measure this collapse. We introduce Finite-State Machine (FSM) Execution as a minimal, fully interpretable framework for evaluating the procedural reasoning capacity of LLMs. In our setup, the model is given an explicit FSM definition and must execute it step-by-step given input actions, maintaining state consistency over multiple turns. This task requires no world knowledge, only faithful application of deterministic transition rules, making it a direct probe of the model's internal procedural fidelity. We measure both Turn Accuracy and Task Accuracy to disentangle immediate computation from cumulative state maintenance. Empirical results reveal systematic degradation as task horizon or branching complexity increases. Models perform significantly worse when rule retrieval involves high branching factors than when memory span is long. Larger models show improved local accuracy but remain brittle under multi-step reasoning unless explicitly prompted to externalize intermediate steps. FSM-based evaluation offers a transparent, complexity-controlled probe for diagnosing this failure mode and guiding the design of inductive biases that enable genuine long-horizon procedural competence. By grounding reasoning in measurable execution fidelity rather than surface correctness, this work helps establish a rigorous experimental foundation for understanding and improving the algorithmic reliability of LLMs.

Motivation: 研究多智能体科学推理中的信念形成和认知孤岛问题，提供可重现的方法来观察和测试现实世界中难以追踪的专家信念动态。

Method: 开发记录重放多智能体交互的框架，支持信念查询和反事实证据注入，应用于具有共享医疗记录和真相代理的医疗案例模拟器。

Result: 发现智能体信念反映现实世界学科立场，包括过度依赖经典研究和抵制反证据，这些信念可以以人类专家无法实现的方式进行追踪和质询。

Conclusion: Ask WhAI通过使信念动态可见和可测试，为研究多智能体科学推理中的信念形成和认知孤岛提供了可重现的方法。

Abstract: We present Ask WhAI, a systems-level framework for inspecting and perturbing belief states in multi-agent interactions. The framework records and replays agent interactions, supports out-of-band queries into each agent's beliefs and rationale, and enables counterfactual evidence injection to test how belief structures respond to new information. We apply the framework to a medical case simulator notable for its multi-agent shared memory (a time-stamped electronic medical record, or EMR) and an oracle agent (the LabAgent) that holds ground truth lab results revealed only when explicitly queried. We stress-test the system on a multi-specialty diagnostic journey for a child with an abrupt-onset neuropsychiatric presentation. Large language model agents, each primed with strong role-specific priors ("act like a neurologist", "act like an infectious disease specialist"), write to a shared medical record and interact with a moderator across sequential or parallel encounters. Breakpoints at key diagnostic moments enable pre- and post-event belief queries, allowing us to distinguish entrenched priors from reasoning or evidence-integration effects. The simulation reveals that agent beliefs often mirror real-world disciplinary stances, including overreliance on canonical studies and resistance to counterevidence, and that these beliefs can be traced and interrogated in ways not possible with human experts. By making such dynamics visible and testable, Ask WhAI offers a reproducible way to study belief formation and epistemic silos in multi-agent scientific reasoning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灾害数据库中的位置信息通常以非结构化文本形式存在，存在粒度不一致和拼写错误等问题，难以与空间数据集集成，限制了灾害风险评估的有效性。

Method: 使用GPT-4o自动处理文本位置信息，通过交叉验证GADM、OpenStreetMap和Wikidata三个独立地理信息库来分配几何形状，并根据源一致性分配可靠性评分。

Result: 应用于2000-2024年EM-DAT数据集，成功地理编码14,215个事件，覆盖17,948个独特位置，无需人工干预，支持所有灾害类型。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了LLM从非结构化文本中提取和结构化地理信息的潜力，为相关分析提供了可扩展且可靠的方法。

Abstract: Subnational location data of disaster events are critical for risk assessment and disaster risk reduction. Disaster databases such as EM-DAT often report locations in unstructured textual form, with inconsistent granularity or spelling, that make it difficult to integrate with spatial datasets. We present a fully automated LLM-assisted workflow that processes and cleans textual location information using GPT-4o, and assigns geometries by cross-checking three independent geoinformation repositories: GADM, OpenStreetMap and Wikidata. Based on the agreement and availability of these sources, we assign a reliability score to each location while generating subnational geometries. Applied to the EM-DAT dataset from 2000 to 2024, the workflow geocodes 14,215 events across 17,948 unique locations. Unlike previous methods, our approach requires no manual intervention, covers all disaster types, enables cross-verification across multiple sources, and allows flexible remapping to preferred frameworks. Beyond the dataset, we demonstrate the potential of LLMs to extract and structure geographic information from unstructured text, offering a scalable and reliable method for related analyses.

Motivation: 确保AI系统（如自动驾驶车辆）的可信度和安全性，关键在于训练和测试数据集的数据相关安全属性，特别是代表性——场景数据反映系统设计安全运行条件（ODD）或预期遇到条件（TOD）的程度。

Method: 采用概率方法比较场景套件特征分布与TOD特征分布，应用不精确贝叶斯方法处理有限数据和不确定先验，生成区间值、不确定性感知的代表性估计。

Result: 通过数值示例展示了在依赖关系和先验不确定性下，跨操作类别（天气、道路类型、时间等）的场景套件与推断TOD分布比较，估计了局部（类别间）和全局的区间代表性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够量化场景数据的代表性，并通过不精确贝叶斯框架处理数据有限性和先验不确定性，为AI系统安全评估提供更可靠的代表性度量。

Abstract: Assuring the trustworthiness and safety of AI systems, e.g., autonomous vehicles (AV), depends critically on the data-related safety properties, e.g., representativeness, completeness, etc., of the datasets used for their training and testing. Among these properties, this paper focuses on representativeness-the extent to which the scenario-based data used for training and testing, reflect the operational conditions that the system is designed to operate safely in, i.e., Operational Design Domain (ODD) or expected to encounter, i.e., Target Operational Domain (TOD). We propose a probabilistic method that quantifies representativeness by comparing the statistical distribution of features encoded by the scenario suites with the corresponding distribution of features representing the TOD, acknowledging that the true TOD distribution is unknown, as it can only be inferred from limited data.
  We apply an imprecise Bayesian method to handle limited data and uncertain priors. The imprecise Bayesian formulation produces interval-valued, uncertainty-aware estimates of representativeness, rather than a single value. We present a numerical example comparing the distributions of the scenario suite and the inferred TOD across operational categories-weather, road type, time of day, etc., under dependencies and prior uncertainty. We estimate representativeness locally (between categories) and globally as an interval.

Motivation: 下一代网络采用O-RAN架构实现动态资源管理，但深度强化学习模型在动态环境中面临鲁棒性和泛化性挑战，需要更有效的资源管理方法。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应选择性SAM机制有效提升了DRL在O-RAN资源管理中的鲁棒性、泛化性和训练稳定性，同时保持学习效率。

Abstract: Next-generation networks utilize the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture to enable dynamic resource management, facilitated by the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC). While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) models show promise in optimizing network resources, they often struggle with robustness and generalizability in dynamic environments. This paper introduces a novel resource management approach that enhances the Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm with Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) in a distributed Multi-Agent RL (MARL) framework. Our method introduces an adaptive and selective SAM mechanism, where regularization is explicitly driven by temporal-difference (TD)-error variance, ensuring that only agents facing high environmental complexity are regularized. This targeted strategy reduces unnecessary overhead, improves training stability, and enhances generalization without sacrificing learning efficiency. We further incorporate a dynamic $ρ$ scheduling scheme to refine the exploration-exploitation trade-off across agents. Experimental results show our method significantly outperforms conventional DRL approaches, yielding up to a $22\%$ improvement in resource allocation efficiency and ensuring superior QoS satisfaction across diverse O-RAN slices.

Abstract: Human-like agents have long been one of the goals in pursuing artificial intelligence. Although reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved superhuman performance in many domains, relatively little attention has been focused on designing human-like RL agents. As a result, many reward-driven RL agents often exhibit unnatural behaviors compared to humans, raising concerns for both interpretability and trustworthiness. To achieve human-like behavior in RL, this paper first formulates human-likeness as trajectory optimization, where the objective is to find an action sequence that closely aligns with human behavior while also maximizing rewards, and adapts the classic receding-horizon control to human-like learning as a tractable and efficient implementation. To achieve this, we introduce Macro Action Quantization (MAQ), a human-like RL framework that distills human demonstrations into macro actions via Vector-Quantized VAE. Experiments on D4RL Adroit benchmarks show that MAQ significantly improves human-likeness, increasing trajectory similarity scores, and achieving the highest human-likeness rankings among all RL agents in the human evaluation study. Our results also demonstrate that MAQ can be easily integrated into various off-the-shelf RL algorithms, opening a promising direction for learning human-like RL agents.

Conclusion: 开源多智能体系统在基因组问答中具有巨大潜力，OpenBioLLM提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Genomic question answering often requires complex reasoning and integration across diverse biomedical sources. GeneGPT addressed this challenge by combining domain-specific APIs with OpenAI's code-davinci-002 large language model to enable natural language interaction with genomic databases. However, its reliance on a proprietary model limits scalability, increases operational costs, and raises concerns about data privacy and generalization.
  In this work, we revisit and reproduce GeneGPT in a pilot study using open source models, including Llama 3.1, Qwen2.5, and Qwen2.5 Coder, within a monolithic architecture; this allows us to identify the limitations of this approach. Building on this foundation, we then develop OpenBioLLM, a modular multi-agent framework that extends GeneGPT by introducing agent specialization for tool routing, query generation, and response validation. This enables coordinated reasoning and role-based task execution.
  OpenBioLLM matches or outperforms GeneGPT on over 90% of the benchmark tasks, achieving average scores of 0.849 on Gene-Turing and 0.830 on GeneHop, while using smaller open-source models without additional fine-tuning or tool-specific pretraining. OpenBioLLM's modular multi-agent design reduces latency by 40-50% across benchmark tasks, significantly improving efficiency without compromising model capability. The results of our comprehensive evaluation highlight the potential of open-source multi-agent systems for genomic question answering.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ProRAC (Progression-based Reasoning about Actions and Change), a neuro-symbolic framework that leverages LLMs to tackle RAC problems. ProRAC extracts fundamental RAC elements including actions and questions from the problem, progressively executes each action to derive the final state, and then evaluates the query against the progressed state to arrive at an answer. We evaluate ProRAC on several RAC benchmarks, and the results demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance across different benchmarks, domains, LLM backbones, and types of RAC tasks.

Result: 在19个分类和9个回归数据集上显著优于现有最先进方法，并能够发现新的科学假设（如心肌数据集中的新生物标志物）。

Conclusion: Rogue One不仅提升了特征提取的性能，还增强了特征的可解释性和科学发现能力，证明了多智能体框架在自动特征工程中的有效性。

Abstract: The performance of machine learning models on tabular data is critically dependent on high-quality feature engineering. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating feature extraction (AutoFE), existing methods are often limited by monolithic LLM architectures, simplistic quantitative feedback, and a failure to systematically integrate external domain knowledge. This paper introduces Rogue One, a novel, LLM-based multi-agent framework for knowledge-informed automatic feature extraction. Rogue One operationalizes a decentralized system of three specialized agents-Scientist, Extractor, and Tester-that collaborate iteratively to discover, generate, and validate predictive features. Crucially, the framework moves beyond primitive accuracy scores by introducing a rich, qualitative feedback mechanism and a "flooding-pruning" strategy, allowing it to dynamically balance feature exploration and exploitation. By actively incorporating external knowledge via an integrated retrieval-augmented (RAG) system, Rogue One generates features that are not only statistically powerful but also semantically meaningful and interpretable. We demonstrate that Rogue One significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a comprehensive suite of 19 classification and 9 regression datasets. Furthermore, we show qualitatively that the system surfaces novel, testable hypotheses, such as identifying a new potential biomarker in the myocardial dataset, underscoring its utility as a tool for scientific discovery.

*Xin Gao,Shaohan Yu,Zerui Chen,Yueming Lyu,Weichen Yu,Guanghao Li,Jiyao Liu,Jianxiong Gao,Jian Liang,Ziwei Liu,Chenyang Si*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SafeRBench是首个端到端评估大型推理模型安全性的基准，从输入、中间推理到最终输出全面评估安全风险，包含风险分类分级、细粒度输出分析和人类安全对齐验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型通过显式思维链提升答案质量，但这种能力也带来了新的安全风险：有害内容可能在推理过程中被微妙注入、逐渐显现或被误导性理由合理化。现有安全评估主要关注输出层面，很少捕捉推理过程中的动态风险。

Method: 1) 输入特征化：将风险类别和级别纳入输入设计；2) 细粒度输出分析：通过微思维分块机制将长推理轨迹分割为语义连贯单元；3) 人类安全对齐：用专门设计的人类标注验证基于LLM的评估。

Result: 对19个大型推理模型的评估表明，SafeRBench能够进行详细的多维安全评估，从多个角度提供风险和保护机制的见解。

Conclusion: SafeRBench填补了推理模型安全评估的空白，为全面理解和管理大型推理模型的安全风险提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) improve answer quality through explicit chain-of-thought, yet this very capability introduces new safety risks: harmful content can be subtly injected, surface gradually, or be justified by misleading rationales within the reasoning trace. Existing safety evaluations, however, primarily focus on output-level judgments and rarely capture these dynamic risks along the reasoning process. In this paper, we present SafeRBench, the first benchmark that assesses LRM safety end-to-end -- from inputs and intermediate reasoning to final outputs. (1) Input Characterization: We pioneer the incorporation of risk categories and levels into input design, explicitly accounting for affected groups and severity, and thereby establish a balanced prompt suite reflecting diverse harm gradients. (2) Fine-Grained Output Analysis: We introduce a micro-thought chunking mechanism to segment long reasoning traces into semantically coherent units, enabling fine-grained evaluation across ten safety dimensions. (3) Human Safety Alignment: We validate LLM-based evaluations against human annotations specifically designed to capture safety judgments. Evaluations on 19 LRMs demonstrate that SafeRBench enables detailed, multidimensional safety assessment, offering insights into risks and protective mechanisms from multiple perspectives.

*Zhiyi Duan,Zixing Shi,Hongyu Yuan,Qi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HISE-KT是一个将异构信息网络与大型语言模型相结合的知识追踪框架，通过智能元路径评估、相似学生检索和结构化提示，实现了更准确且可解释的知识状态预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于HIN的方法因手动或随机选择元路径而引入噪声的问题，以及LLM方法忽略学生间丰富信息的问题，同时提升预测的准确性和可解释性。

Method: 构建多关系HIN捕获结构关系，使用LLM智能评分和过滤元路径实例，设计基于元路径的相似学生检索机制，通过结构化提示整合目标学生历史与相似轨迹。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上的实验表明，HISE-KT在预测性能和可解释性方面均优于现有知识追踪基线方法。

Conclusion: HISE-KT成功融合了HIN和LLM的优势，实现了自动化元路径质量评估和证据支持的可解释分析，为知识追踪提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to mine students' evolving knowledge states and predict their future question-answering performance. Existing methods based on heterogeneous information networks (HINs) are prone to introducing noises due to manual or random selection of meta-paths and lack necessary quality assessment of meta-path instances. Conversely, recent large language models (LLMs)-based methods ignore the rich information across students, and both paradigms struggle to deliver consistently accurate and evidence-based explanations. To address these issues, we propose an innovative framework, HIN-LLM Synergistic Enhanced Knowledge Tracing (HISE-KT), which seamlessly integrates HINs with LLMs. HISE-KT first builds a multi-relationship HIN containing diverse node types to capture the structural relations through multiple meta-paths. The LLM is then employed to intelligently score and filter meta-path instances and retain high-quality paths, pioneering automated meta-path quality assessment. Inspired by educational psychology principles, a similar student retrieval mechanism based on meta-paths is designed to provide a more valuable context for prediction. Finally, HISE-KT uses a structured prompt to integrate the target student's history with the retrieved similar trajectories, enabling the LLM to generate not only accurate predictions but also evidence-backed, explainable analysis reports. Experiments on four public datasets show that HISE-KT outperforms existing KT baselines in both prediction performance and interpretability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: COPYCHECK是一个利用不确定性信号检测LLM训练数据中版权内容的框架，将LLM的过度自信转化为优势，通过不确定性模式区分训练数据和非训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在训练过程中可能使用了受版权保护的内容，现有成员推理攻击方法存在局限性，如LLM的过度自信、缺乏真实训练数据访问权限以及依赖经验性阈值。

Method: 采用两阶段策略：(1) 将文件分割成小片段以减少对大规模训练数据的依赖；(2) 基于不确定性的无监督聚类，无需经验性阈值调整。

Result: 在LLaMA 7b和LLaMA2 7b上分别达到90.1%和91.6%的平均平衡准确率，相比SOTA基线提升超过90%，在GPT-J 6B上也保持高性能。

Conclusion: 这是首个将不确定性应用于LLM版权检测的工作，为训练数据透明度提供了实用工具。

Abstract: The remarkable language ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) stems from extensive training on vast datasets, often including copyrighted material, which raises serious concerns about unauthorized use. While Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) offer potential solutions for detecting such violations, existing approaches face critical limitations and challenges due to LLMs' inherent overconfidence, limited access to ground truth training data, and reliance on empirically determined thresholds.
  We present COPYCHECK, a novel framework that leverages uncertainty signals to detect whether copyrighted content was used in LLM training sets. Our method turns LLM overconfidence from a limitation into an asset by capturing uncertainty patterns that reliably distinguish between ``seen" (training data) and ``unseen" (non-training data) content. COPYCHECK further implements a two-fold strategy: (1) strategic segmentation of files into smaller snippets to reduce dependence on large-scale training data, and (2) uncertainty-guided unsupervised clustering to eliminate the need for empirically tuned thresholds. Experiment results show that COPYCHECK achieves an average balanced accuracy of 90.1% on LLaMA 7b and 91.6% on LLaMA2 7b in detecting seen files. Compared to the SOTA baseline, COPYCHECK achieves over 90% relative improvement, reaching up to 93.8\% balanced accuracy. It further exhibits strong generalizability across architectures, maintaining high performance on GPT-J 6B. This work presents the first application of uncertainty for copyright detection in LLMs, offering practical tools for training data transparency.

Motivation: 现有方法往往单独使用优化或LLM，未能充分利用两者的协同优势。SOLID旨在通过整合数学优化的精确性和LLM的上下文理解能力，实现更智能的决策制定。

Method: 提出SOLID框架，通过优化代理和LLM代理的迭代协作，使用对偶价格和偏差惩罚作为交互机制，在凸性假设下保持理论收敛性。

Result: 在股票投资组合案例中，SOLID在各种场景下均表现出收敛性，年化收益率相比纯优化方法有所提升，验证了两个代理的协同效应。

Conclusion: SOLID为跨领域自动化和智能决策提供了一个有前景的框架，展示了优化与LLM协同的潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces SOLID (Synergizing Optimization and Large Language Models for Intelligent Decision-Making), a novel framework that integrates mathematical optimization with the contextual capabilities of large language models (LLMs). SOLID facilitates iterative collaboration between optimization and LLMs agents through dual prices and deviation penalties. This interaction improves the quality of the decisions while maintaining modularity and data privacy. The framework retains theoretical convergence guarantees under convexity assumptions, providing insight into the design of LLMs prompt. To evaluate SOLID, we applied it to a stock portfolio investment case with historical prices and financial news as inputs. Empirical results demonstrate convergence under various scenarios and indicate improved annualized returns compared to a baseline optimizer-only method, validating the synergy of the two agents. SOLID offers a promising framework for advancing automated and intelligent decision-making across diverse domains.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI研究正转向复杂问题解决，推理AI的性能不再受限于训练数据量，而是随着训练和推理的指数级计算投入持续扩展，但效率改进正接近物理极限，缺乏可比较的饱和点。

Method: 讨论了推理AI可持续性的研究方向和政策路径。

Result: 效率提升无法单独确保推理AI的可持续性。

Conclusion: 需要在推理AI系统的优化和治理中嵌入明确限制，以实现可持续性。

Abstract: AI research is increasingly moving toward complex problem solving, where models are optimized not only for pattern recognition but for multi-step reasoning. Historically, computing's global energy footprint has been stabilized by sustained efficiency gains and natural saturation thresholds in demand. But as efficiency improvements are approaching physical limits, emerging reasoning AI lacks comparable saturation points: performance is no longer limited by the amount of available training data but continues to scale with exponential compute investments in both training and inference. This paper argues that efficiency alone will not lead to sustainable reasoning AI and discusses research and policy directions to embed explicit limits into the optimization and governance of such systems.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了AI研究中两种对立的智能观：智能现实主义（认为智能是单一、普遍的跨系统能力）与智能多元主义（认为智能是多样化、情境依赖的能力），并分析这两种观点如何影响研究方法、现象解释和风险评估。


<details>

Motivation: 当前AI研究中对智能本质的隐含假设影响了实证证据的解释和研究方向，作者希望明确这些底层观点以澄清研究分歧。

Method: 通过分析AI研究中的当前辩论，揭示两种智能观在模型选择、基准设计、实验验证等方法论问题上的不同影响。

Result: 发现两种智能观导致对相同经验现象（如能力涌现、系统局限）的矛盾解读，并在AI风险评估上产生根本不同的结论。

Conclusion: 明确这些底层假设有助于更清晰地理解AI研究中的分歧，促进更富有成效的学术对话。

Abstract: In this paper, we argue that current AI research operates on a spectrum between two different underlying conceptions of intelligence: Intelligence Realism, which holds that intelligence represents a single, universal capacity measurable across all systems, and Intelligence Pluralism, which views intelligence as diverse, context-dependent capacities that cannot be reduced to a single universal measure. Through an analysis of current debates in AI research, we demonstrate how the conceptions remain largely implicit yet fundamentally shape how empirical evidence gets interpreted across a wide range of areas. These underlying views generate fundamentally different research approaches across three areas. Methodologically, they produce different approaches to model selection, benchmark design, and experimental validation. Interpretively, they lead to contradictory readings of the same empirical phenomena, from capability emergence to system limitations. Regarding AI risk, they generate categorically different assessments: realists view superintelligence as the primary risk and search for unified alignment solutions, while pluralists see diverse threats across different domains requiring context-specific solutions. We argue that making explicit these underlying assumptions can contribute to a clearer understanding of disagreements in AI research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态推理模型存在架构限制，缺乏人类式的自主探索多样化推理路径的能力，无法适应动态变化的任务需求

Method: 提出Octopus框架，定义六种核心多模态推理能力，构建Octopus-Bench评估基准，实现自主推理探索和动态能力选择

Result: 在Octopus-Bench的大多数任务中取得最佳性能，证明了能力协调在多模态推理中的关键作用

Conclusion: 能力协调是智能多模态推理的关键，Octopus框架通过六种核心能力的编排实现了人类式的推理灵活性

Abstract: Existing multimodal reasoning models and frameworks suffer from fundamental architectural limitations: most lack the human-like ability to autonomously explore diverse reasoning pathways-whether in direct inference, tool-driven visual exploration, programmatic visual manipulation, or intrinsic visual imagination. Consequently, they struggle to adapt to dynamically changing capability requirements in real-world tasks. Meanwhile, humans exhibit a complementary set of thinking abilities when addressing such tasks, whereas existing methods typically cover only a subset of these dimensions. Inspired by this, we propose Octopus: Agentic Multimodal Reasoning with Six-Capability Orchestration, a new paradigm for multimodal agentic reasoning. We define six core capabilities essential for multimodal reasoning and organize a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, Octopus-Bench, accordingly. Octopus is capable of autonomously exploring during reasoning and dynamically selecting the most appropriate capability based on the current state. Experimental results show that Octopus achieves the best performance on the vast majority of tasks in Octopus-Bench, highlighting the crucial role of capability coordination in agentic multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: Terra Nova是一个受《文明V》启发的综合挑战环境，旨在同时测试强化学习智能体在多个经典挑战中的综合推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的多任务基准主要评估智能体在不同任务间切换策略的能力，而非测试其在多个相互关联挑战中进行深度推理的能力。需要创建能同时引发多个RL挑战的单一环境。

Method: 开发了Terra Nova环境，这是一个受《文明V》启发的综合挑战环境，其中部分可观测性、信用分配、表示学习、巨大动作空间等多个经典RL挑战同时出现。

Result: 创建了一个能够同时测试智能体在多个相互关联挑战中综合推理能力的基准环境。

Conclusion: Terra Nova为评估强化学习智能体在复杂、长视野、多挑战环境中的综合推理能力提供了更合适的测试平台。

Abstract: We introduce Terra Nova, a new comprehensive challenge environment (CCE) for reinforcement learning (RL) research inspired by Civilization V. A CCE is a single environment in which multiple canonical RL challenges (e.g., partial observability, credit assignment, representation learning, enormous action spaces, etc.) arise simultaneously. Mastery therefore demands integrated, long-horizon understanding across many interacting variables. We emphasize that this definition excludes challenges that only aggregate unrelated tasks in independent, parallel streams (e.g., learning to play all Atari games at once). These aggregated multitask benchmarks primarily asses whether an agent can catalog and switch among unrelated policies rather than test an agent's ability to perform deep reasoning across many interacting challenges.

Motivation: 研究智能体是否能够通过交互式学习获得类似人类的物理和因果推理能力，并随着经验积累持续改进。

Method: 使用IPR框架，结合世界模型推演来评分和强化VLM策略，引入PhysCode物理中心动作编码作为预测和推理的共享动作空间。

Result: 在1000+异构游戏上预训练后，IPR在生存、好奇心、效用三个推理级别表现稳健，整体性能匹配GPT-5，在好奇心级别超越GPT-5，且性能随训练游戏和交互步骤增加而提升，并能零样本迁移到未见游戏。

Conclusion: 物理中心的交互学习是实现持续改进物理推理能力的有效途径。

Abstract: Humans learn by observing, interacting with environments, and internalizing physics and causality. Here, we aim to ask whether an agent can similarly acquire human-like reasoning from interaction and keep improving with more experience. We study this in a Game-to-Unseen (G2U) setting, curating 1,000+ heterogeneous games with diverse physical and causal mechanisms, and evaluate at three human-like levels: Survival, Curiosity, Utility, from primitive intuition to goal-driven reasoning. Our analysis reveals complementary failures: VLM/VLA agents reason but lack look-ahead in interactive settings, while world models imagine but imitate visual patterns rather than analyze physics and causality. We therefore propose IPR (Interactive Physical Reasoner), using world-model rollouts to score and reinforce a VLM's policy, and introduce PhysCode, a physics-centric action code aligning semantic intent with dynamics to provide a shared action space for prediction and reasoning. Pretrained on 1,000+ games, our IPR performs robustly on three levels, matches GPT-5 overall, and surpasses it on Curiosity. We find that performance improves with more training games and interaction steps, and that the model also zero-shot transfers to unseen games. These results support physics-centric interaction as a path to steadily improving physical reasoning.

Method: TIM框架包含：基于扎根理论的DeFi意图分类法、多智能体LLM系统（元级规划器协调领域专家分解意图分析任务、问题求解器处理多模态数据、认知评估器减轻幻觉并确保可验证性）。

Result: 实验表明TIM显著优于机器学习模型、单一LLM和单一智能体基线方法，能够提供更可靠的用户动机理解和复杂区块链活动的上下文感知解释。

Conclusion: TIM框架为DeFi用户意图理解提供了更可靠的解决方案，有助于深入理解用户动机并为复杂区块链活动提供上下文感知解释。

Abstract: As Decentralized Finance (DeFi) develops, understanding user intent behind DeFi transactions is crucial yet challenging due to complex smart contract interactions, multifaceted on-/off-chain factors, and opaque hex logs. Existing methods lack deep semantic insight. To address this, we propose the Transaction Intent Mining (TIM) framework. TIM leverages a DeFi intent taxonomy built on grounded theory and a multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) system to robustly infer user intents. A Meta-Level Planner dynamically coordinates domain experts to decompose multiple perspective-specific intent analyses into solvable subtasks. Question Solvers handle the tasks with multi-modal on/off-chain data. While a Cognitive Evaluator mitigates LLM hallucinations and ensures verifiability. Experiments show that TIM significantly outperforms machine learning models, single LLMs, and single Agent baselines. We also analyze core challenges in intent inference. This work helps provide a more reliable understanding of user motivations in DeFi, offering context-aware explanations for complex blockchain activity.

Abstract: AI research agents offer the promise to accelerate scientific progress by automating the design, implementation, and training of machine learning models. However, the field is still in its infancy, and the key factors driving the success or failure of agent trajectories are not fully understood. We examine the role that ideation diversity plays in agent performance. First, we analyse agent trajectories on MLE-bench, a well-known benchmark to evaluate AI research agents, across different models and agent scaffolds. Our analysis reveals that different models and agent scaffolds yield varying degrees of ideation diversity, and that higher-performing agents tend to have increased ideation diversity. Further, we run a controlled experiment where we modify the degree of ideation diversity, demonstrating that higher ideation diversity results in stronger performance. Finally, we strengthen our results by examining additional evaluation metrics beyond the standard medal-based scoring of MLE-bench, showing that our findings still hold across other agent performance metrics.

Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical machine learning represents a frontier in computational research, combining the potential advantages of quantum computing with established classical optimization techniques. PennyLane provides a Python framework that seamlessly bridges quantum circuits and classical machine learning, enabling researchers to build, optimize, and deploy variational quantum algorithms. This paper introduces PennyLane as a versatile tool for quantum machine learning, optimization, and quantum chemistry applications. We demonstrate use cases including quantum kernel methods, variational quantum eigensolvers, portfolio optimization, and integration with classical ML frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX. Through concrete Python examples with widely used libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib, we show how PennyLane facilitates efficient quantum circuit construction, automatic differentiation, and hybrid optimization workflows. By situating PennyLane within the broader context of quantum computing and machine learning, we highlight its role as a methodological building block for quantum-enhanced data science. Our goal is to provide researchers and practitioners with a concise reference that bridges foundational quantum computing concepts and applied machine learning practice, making PennyLane a default citation for hybrid quantum-classical workflows in Python-based research.

Motivation: 区域供热站故障早期检测对于降低回水温度和提高效率至关重要，但该领域发展受到公开标记数据集有限的阻碍。

Method: 开发了EnergyFaultDetector开源Python框架，结合服务报告验证的公开数据集，使用基于准确性、可靠性和早期性的评估方法。

Result: 模型实现了高正常行为准确性（0.98）和事件F分数（0.83），在客户报告问题前检测到60%的故障，平均提前时间为3.9天。

Conclusion: 整合开放数据集、指标、开源代码和基准建立了可重现的故障中心基准，为区域供热站早期故障检测和诊断方法提供一致比较和开发基础。

Abstract: Early detection of faults in district heating substations is imperative to reduce return temperatures and enhance efficiency. However, progress in this domain has been hindered by the limited availability of public, labelled datasets. We present an open source framework combining a service report validated public dataset, an evaluation method based on Accuracy, Reliability, and Earliness, and baseline results implemented with EnergyFaultDetector, an open source Python framework.
  The dataset contains time series of operational data from 93 substations across two manufacturers, annotated with a list of disturbances due to faults and maintenance actions, a set of normal-event examples and detailed fault metadata. We evaluate the EnergyFaultDetector using three metrics: Accuracy for recognising normal behaviour, an eventwise F Score for reliable fault detection with few false alarms, and Earliness for early detection. The framework also supports root cause analysis using ARCANA. We demonstrate three use cases to assist operators in interpreting anomalies and identifying underlying faults. The models achieve high normal-behaviour accuracy (0.98) and eventwise F-score (beta=0.5) of 0.83, detecting 60% of the faults in the dataset before the customer reports a problem, with an average lead time of 3.9 days.
  Integrating an open dataset, metrics, open source code, and baselines establishes a reproducible, fault centric benchmark with operationally meaningful evaluation, enabling consistent comparison and development of early fault detection and diagnosis methods for district heating substations.

Result: 在VSBPP问题的CMSA元启发式上测试，irace-evo发现了优于现有最优CMSA实现的新算法变体，使用轻量级模型（如Claude Haiku 3.5）且总成本低于2欧元。

Conclusion: 将自动配置与LLM驱动的代码进化相结合，为启发式设计和元启发式优化提供了一个强大且成本效益高的途径。

Abstract: Automatic algorithm configuration tools such as irace efficiently tune parameter values but leave algorithmic code unchanged. This paper introduces a first version of irace-evo, an extension of irace that integrates code evolution through large language models (LLMs) to jointly explore parameter and code spaces. The proposed framework enables multi-language support (e.g., C++, Python), reduces token consumption via progressive context management, and employs the Always-From-Original principle to ensure robust and controlled code evolution. We evaluate irace-evo on the Construct, Merge, Solve & Adapt (CMSA) metaheuristic for the Variable-Sized Bin Packing Problem (VSBPP). Experimental results show that irace-evo can discover new algorithm variants that outperform the state-of-the-art CMSA implementation while maintaining low computational and monetary costs. Notably, irace-evo generates competitive algorithmic improvements using lightweight models (e.g., Claude Haiku 3.5) with a total usage cost under 2 euros. These results demonstrate that coupling automatic configuration with LLM-driven code evolution provides a powerful, cost-efficient avenue for advancing heuristic design and metaheuristic optimization.

*Ahmad Memon,Abdallah Mohamed*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文比较了两种AI编程作业评分方法：直接评分法和反向评分法，评估它们在编程作业自动评分中的效果和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动批改编程作业耗时且存在不一致性，传统单元测试只能提供二元通过/失败结果。大语言模型的发展为自动化、可扩展且更客观的评分提供了可能。

Method: 比较两种AI评分技术：直接评分法（AI直接根据评分标准评估学生代码）和反向评分法（AI先修复错误，然后根据修复的性质和数量推断分数）。两种方法分别在原始评分标准和10倍扩展评分标准上评估。

Result: 初步发现表明，直接方法更快更直接，但反向技术通过关注修正工作量通常能提供更细粒度的评估。两种方法都需要仔细的提示工程，特别是在分配部分分数和处理逻辑错误时。

Conclusion: 讨论了每种方法的优缺点、提示设计的实际考虑因素，以及未来混合人机评分系统的方向，旨在提高计算机科学课程评分的一致性、效率和公平性。

Abstract: Manual grading of programming assignments in introductory computer science courses can be time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies. While unit testing is commonly used for automatic evaluation, it typically follows a binary pass/fail model and does not give partial marks. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer the potential for automated, scalable, and more objective grading.
  This paper compares two AI-based grading techniques: \textit{Direct}, where the AI model applies a rubric directly to student code, and \textit{Reverse} (a newly proposed approach), where the AI first fixes errors, then deduces a grade based on the nature and number of fixes. Each method was evaluated on both the instructor's original grading scale and a tenfold expanded scale to assess the impact of range on AI grading accuracy. To assess their effectiveness, AI-assigned scores were evaluated against human tutor evaluations on a range of coding problems and error types.
  Initial findings suggest that while the Direct approach is faster and straightforward, the Reverse technique often provides a more fine-grained assessment by focusing on correction effort. Both methods require careful prompt engineering, particularly for allocating partial credit and handling logic errors. To further test consistency, we also used synthetic student code generated using Gemini Flash 2.0, which allowed us to evaluate AI graders on a wider range of controlled error types and difficulty levels. We discuss the strengths and limitations of each approach, practical considerations for prompt design, and future directions for hybrid human-AI grading systems that aim to improve consistency, efficiency, and fairness in CS courses.

Abstract: Autonomous systems must sustain justified confidence in their correctness and safety across their operational lifecycle-from design and deployment through post-deployment evolution. Traditional assurance methods often separate development-time assurance from runtime assurance, yielding fragmented arguments that cannot adapt to runtime changes or system updates - a significant challenge for assured autonomy. Towards addressing this, we propose a unified Continuous Assurance Framework that integrates design-time, runtime, and evolution-time assurance within a traceable, model-driven workflow as a step towards assured autonomy. In this paper, we specifically instantiate the design-time phase of the framework using two formal verification methods: RoboChart for functional correctness and PRISM for probabilistic risk analysis. We also propose a model-driven transformation pipeline, implemented as an Eclipse plugin, that automatically regenerates structured assurance arguments whenever formal specifications or their verification results change, thereby ensuring traceability. We demonstrate our approach on a nuclear inspection robot scenario, and discuss its alignment with the Trilateral AI Principles, reflecting regulator-endorsed best practices.

Result: 评估了多个先进LLM，结果显示不同模型和评估模式之间存在显著能力差距。

Conclusion: 该基准测试为结构化图表生成研究提供了基础，有助于开发更严格、细粒度的评估方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated excellent capabilities in generating structured diagrams from natural language descriptions. In particular, they have shown great promise in generating sequence diagrams for software engineering, typically represented in a text-based syntax such as Mermaid. However, systematic evaluations in this space remain underdeveloped as there is a lack of existing benchmarks to assess the LLM's correctness in this task. To address this shortcoming, we introduce MermaidSeqBench, a human-verified and LLM-synthetically-extended benchmark for assessing an LLM's capabilities in generating Mermaid sequence diagrams from textual prompts. The benchmark consists of a core set of 132 samples, starting from a small set of manually crafted and verified flows. These were expanded via a hybrid methodology combining human annotation, in-context LLM prompting, and rule-based variation generation. Our benchmark uses an LLM-as-a-judge model to assess Mermaid sequence diagram generation across fine-grained metrics, including syntax correctness, activation handling, error handling, and practical usability. We perform initial evaluations on numerous state-of-the-art LLMs and utilize multiple LLM judge models to demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our benchmark. Our results reveal significant capability gaps across models and evaluation modes. Our proposed benchmark provides a foundation for advancing research in structured diagram generation and for developing more rigorous, fine-grained evaluation methodologies.

Conclusion: AdvPrompt-MIA能够捕捉更丰富的记忆模式，准确推断训练集成员关系，具有实际应用价值和通用性。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) on code completion models offer an effective way to assess privacy risks by inferring whether a given code snippet was part of the training data. Existing black- and gray-box MIAs rely on expensive surrogate models or manually crafted heuristic rules, which limit their ability to capture the nuanced memorization patterns exhibited by over-parameterized code language models. To address these challenges, we propose AdvPrompt-MIA, a method specifically designed for code completion models, combining code-specific adversarial perturbations with deep learning. The core novelty of our method lies in designing a series of adversarial prompts that induce variations in the victim code model's output. By comparing these outputs with the ground-truth completion, we construct feature vectors to train a classifier that automatically distinguishes member from non-member samples. This design allows our method to capture richer memorization patterns and accurately infer training set membership. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on widely adopted models, such as Code Llama 7B, over the APPS and HumanEval benchmarks. The results show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with AUC gains of up to 102%. In addition, our method exhibits strong transferability across different models and datasets, underscoring its practical utility and generalizability.

Conclusion: 为基于LLM的Web测试研究奠定了基础，并为该领域的持续进步提供了资源支持。

Abstract: Automated web application testing is a critical component of modern software development, with frameworks like Selenium widely adopted for validating functionality through browser automation. Among the essential aspects of such testing is the ability to interact with and validate web forms, a task that requires syntactically correct, executable scripts with high coverage of input fields. Despite its importance, this task remains underexplored in the context of large language models (LLMs), and no public benchmark or dataset exists to evaluate LLMs on form interaction generation systematically. This paper introduces a novel method for training LLMs to generate high-quality test cases in Selenium, specifically targeting form interaction testing. We curate both synthetic and human-annotated datasets for training and evaluation, covering diverse real-world forms and testing scenarios. We define clear metrics for syntax correctness, script executability, and input field coverage. Our empirical study demonstrates that our approach significantly outperforms strong baselines, including GPT-4o and other popular LLMs, across all evaluation metrics. Our work lays the groundwork for future research on LLM-based web testing and provides resources to support ongoing progress in this area.

Method: 对开发者讨论和真实代码片段进行实证调查，采用三阶段验证流程（三位作者独立分析后达成共识），将异味按根本原因和框架特性进行分类。

Result: 识别出30种PyTorch相关异味和16种TensorFlow/Keras异味，为每种异味推导出至少一个最佳实践，共提出50个推荐编码模式。

Conclusion: 这是首个全面检查主要ML框架中导致资源泄漏代码异味的研究，提供了可操作的最佳实践，帮助开发者构建更高效和可持续的ML应用。

Abstract: Much of the existing ML research focuses on model performance metrics, leaving limited attention to the long-term sustainability and resource efficiency of ML applications. While high performance is essential, ensuring efficient resource management is equally critical for robust deployment. This study addresses this gap by systematically identifying code smells that lead to resource leaks in ML applications. We conducted an empirical investigation of developer discussions and real-world code snippets from PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras. The analysis identified 30 PyTorch-related smells and 16 TensorFlow/Keras smells linked to resource leaks. These smells were categorized in two ways: (1) based on their root causes, and (2) as general ML smells with framework-specific characteristics. For each smell, we derived at least one best practice, resulting in 50 recommended coding patterns aimed at reducing resource leakage and improving efficiency. To ensure the validity of our findings, we employed a three-phase validation process involving independent analysis by three authors followed by consensus discussions. This is the first comprehensive study to examine resource-leak-inducing code smells across major ML frameworks and to present actionable best practices for mitigating them. The contributions support developers in building more efficient and sustainable ML applications and offer a structured view of the underlying causes of resource leaks.

Abstract: Complex software-driven systems often interleave distributed, concurrent computation processes with physical interactions with the environment. Developing these systems more efficiently and safely can be achieved by employing actionable, software-based models. From a high-level system model, engineers often need to derive multiple specialized models for different purposes, including simulation, deployment, and formal verification. Each of these target models usually rely on its own formalism, specification language, and execution platform. Traditionally, a compiler analyzes a program written in a programming language and generates executable code. In contrast, a model compiler processes a source model written in a modeling language and should ideally support the generation of multiple heterogeneous targets. However, most existing modeling languages are designed with a narrow focus, typically targeting only simulation or implementation. Multi-target compilation, when not considered during the language's early design, becomes significantly harder to achieve. In this paper, we introduce our initiative: a toolchain and modeling language called M, designed to support system modeling and multi-target compilation for model-driven engineering of complex, concurrent, and time-aware systems. M is a textual, grammar-driven language based on the actor model and extended with discrete-event scheduling semantics. It provides constructs for modeling system entities, message-based interactions, and time- or state-triggered reactions. From such models, M enables the systematic generation of diverse target artifacts while preserving semantic conformance to the original model. Moreover, M can serve as a middle language to which other modeling languages may anchor, thereby allowing them to benefit from its compilation framework.

Abstract: Software development automation is a long-term goal in software engineering. With the development of artificial intelligence (AI), more and more researchers are exploring approaches to software automation. They view AI systems as tools or assistants in software development, still requiring significant human involvement. Another initiative is ``vibe coding'', where AI systems write and repeatedly revise most (or even all) of the code. We foresee these two development paths will converge towards the same destination: AI systems participate in throughout the software development lifecycle, expanding boundaries of full-stack software development. In this paper, we present a vision of an iterative end-to-end automated software development paradigm AutoSW. It operates in an analyze-plan-implement-deliver loop, where AI systems as human partners become first-class actors, translating human intentions expressed in natural language into executable software. We explore a lightweight prototype across the paradigm and initially execute various representative cases. The results indicate that AutoSW can successfully deliver executable software, providing a feasible direction for truly end-to-end automated software development.

Conclusion: ML文档可以整合到ML系统的软件工程过程中，为将ML特定知识转化为结构化需求提供了可行途径。

Abstract: In software engineering processes for machine learning (ML)-enabled systems, integrating and verifying ML components is a major challenge. A prerequisite is the specification of ML component requirements, including models and data, an area where traditional requirements engineering (RE) processes face new obstacles. An underexplored source of RE-relevant information in this context is ML documentation such as ModelCards and DataSheets. However, it is uncertain to what extent RE-relevant information can be extracted from these documents. This study first investigates the amount and nature of RE-relevant information in 20 publicly available ModelCards and DataSheets. We show that these documents contain a significant amount of potentially RE-relevant information. Next, we evaluate how effectively three established RE representations (EARS, Rupp's template, and Volere) can structure this knowledge into requirements. Our results demonstrate that there is a pathway to transform ML-specific knowledge into structured requirements, incorporating ML documentation in software engineering processes for ML systems.

Motivation: 在验证感知编程语言如Dafny中，规范与实现一样容易出错，规范中的缺陷可能导致形式化验证的程序偏离预期行为。

Method: 采用变异测试方法，从流行工具中分析适用的变异算子，并从GitHub上的Dafny项目错误修复提交中合成新的算子，共实现32个变异算子。

Result: 在794个真实世界Dafny程序数据集上评估，手动分析未检测到的变异体，识别出5个弱规范（平均每241行代码一个），这些规范需要加强。

Conclusion: MutDafny能有效提高Dafny规范的可靠性，通过变异测试揭示规范中的潜在弱点。

Abstract: This paper explores the use of mutation testing to reveal weaknesses in formal specifications written in Dafny. In verification-aware programming languages, such as Dafny, despite their critical role, specifications are as prone to errors as implementations. Flaws in specs can result in formally verified programs that deviate from the intended behavior.
  We present MutDafny, a tool that increases the reliability of Dafny specifications by automatically signaling potential weaknesses. Using a mutation testing approach, we introduce faults (mutations) into the code and rely on formal specifications for detecting them. If a program with a mutant verifies, this may indicate a weakness in the specification. We extensively analyze mutation operators from popular tools, identifying the ones applicable to Dafny. In addition, we synthesize new operators tailored for Dafny from bugfix commits in publicly available Dafny projects on GitHub. Drawing from both, we equipped our tool with a total of 32 mutation operators. We evaluate MutDafny's effectiveness and efficiency in a dataset of 794 real-world Dafny programs and we manually analyze a subset of the resulting undetected mutants, identifying five weak real-world specifications (on average, one at every 241 lines of code) that would benefit from strengthening.

TL;DR: EPSO是一个基于缓存的eBPF超级优化器，通过离线超级优化发现重写规则并重用，在最小运行时开销下实现高质量优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: eBPF程序受限于内核验证器的严格安全约束和有限编译器优化支持，手工优化规则设计困难且效果有限，而传统超级优化计算成本高难以扩展。

Method: 提出EPSO方法，通过离线超级优化发现重写规则并缓存重用，结合规则发现和运行时优化重用。

Result: EPSO发现795条重写规则，相比Clang输出程序大小减少最高68.87%（平均24.37%），在所有基准测试中优于K2，在92.68%测试中优于Merlin，程序运行时间平均减少6.60%。

Conclusion: EPSO通过缓存式超级优化有效解决了eBPF程序优化问题，在程序大小和运行性能方面都取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) allows developers to extend Linux kernel functionality without modifying its source code. To ensure system safety, an in-kernel safety checker, the verifier, enforces strict safety constraints (for example, a limited program size) on eBPF programs loaded into the kernel. These constraints, combined with eBPF's performance-critical use cases, make effective optimization essential. However, existing compilers (such as Clang) offer limited optimization support, and many semantics-preserving transformations are rejected by the verifier, which makes handcrafted optimization rule design both challenging and limited in effectiveness. Superoptimization overcomes the limitations of rule-based methods by automatically discovering optimal transformations, but its high computational cost limits scalability. To address this, we propose EPSO, a caching-based superoptimizer that discovers rewrite rules via offline superoptimization and reuses them to achieve high-quality optimizations with minimal runtime overhead. We evaluate EPSO on benchmarks from the Linux kernel and several eBPF-based projects, including Cilium, Katran, hXDP, Sysdig, Tetragon, and Tracee. EPSO discovers 795 rewrite rules and achieves up to 68.87 percent (average 24.37 percent) reduction in program size compared to Clang's output, outperforming the state-of-the-art BPF optimizer K2 on all benchmarks and Merlin on 92.68 percent of them. Additionally, EPSO reduces program runtime by an average of 6.60 percent, improving throughput and lowering latency in network applications.

Method: 框架首先提示LLM生成测试套件，然后将测试用例最小化问题建模为二次无约束二进制优化模型，兼容经典求解器和量子退火器等新兴硬件。

Result: 量子退火解决核心TCM任务比模拟退火快16倍，端到端框架减少总token消耗36.5%，显著提高代码质量。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了生成式AI与组合优化在软件工程中的强大协同作用，突显了精确模型制定的关键重要性。

Abstract: Precisely controlling Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate efficient and concise code is a central challenge in software engineering. We introduce a framework based on Test-Driven Development (TDD) that transforms code specification into a combinatorial optimization task. The framework first prompts an LLM to generate a test suite, then formulates the Test Case Minimization (TCM) problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model. This QUBO paradigm is compatible with both classical solvers and emerging hardware such as quantum annealers. Experimentally, quantum annealing solves the core TCM task 16 times faster than simulated annealing. This performance underpins our end-to-end framework, which reduces total token consumption by 36.5\% and significantly improves code quality. This work demonstrates a powerful synergy between generative AI and combinatorial optimization in software engineering, highlighting the critical importance of precise model formulation.

### [196] [Transformer Injectivity & Geometric Robustness - Analytic Margins and Bi-Lipschitz Uniformity of Sequence-Level Hidden States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14808)
*Mikael von Strauss*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了仅解码器Transformer中从离散提示到最后一词隐藏状态的映射的注入性，证明了在温和条件下该映射在参数空间中是泛函单射的，并通过几何诊断方法在实际模型中验证了这一性质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformer表示的单射性对于理解模型如何区分不同输入以及表示空间的结构具有重要意义，特别是在量化等实际部署场景下。

Method: 定义了碰撞判别式和单射层，证明了参数空间中的二分法性质；设计了分离边距和共Lipschitz常数等几何诊断指标，在LLaMA-3、Qwen和GPT-2等模型上进行了实证研究。

Result: 理论证明在连续参数理想化下Transformer表示是泛函单射的；实证发现在全精度和8位量化下无碰撞，4位量化会引入少量碰撞并显著降低共Lipschitz估计值；训练过程中归一化指标保持稳定。

Conclusion: Transformer表示在连续参数理想化下是泛函且持续单射的，其实际可逆性可以通过简单的几何诊断方法进行探测，量化会降低表示的单射性。

Abstract: Under real-analytic assumptions on decoder-only Transformers, recent work shows that the map from discrete prompts to last-token hidden states is generically injective on finite prompt sets. We refine this picture: for each layer $\ell$ we define a collision discriminant $Δ^\ell \subset Θ$ and injective stratum $U^\ell = Θ\setminus Δ^\ell$, and prove a dichotomy -- either the model is nowhere injective on the set, or $U^\ell$ is open and dense and every $F^\ell_θ$ is injective. Under mild non-singularity assumptions on the optimizer and an absolutely continuous initialization, generic injectivity persists along smooth training trajectories over any fixed horizon. We also treat symmetry groups $G$, showing that discriminants and injective strata descend to the quotient $Θ/G$, so injectivity is naturally a property of functional equivalence classes.
  We complement these results with an empirical study of layerwise geometric diagnostics. We define a separation margin and a co-Lipschitz (lower Lipschitz) constant between prompt space and last-token representation space, estimated via nearest-neighbor statistics on large prompt sets. Applying these diagnostics to pretrained LLaMA-3 and Qwen models, we study behavior across layers, sequence lengths, model scales, and 8- and 4-bit activation quantization. On our sampled prompts we see no collisions in full precision or at 8 bits, while 4-bit quantization induces a small number of collisions and markedly shrinks co-Lipschitz estimates. For a small GPT-2 trained from scratch, normalized metrics remain stable over training. Overall, the results suggest that Transformer representations are generically and persistently injective in the continuous-parameter idealization, while their practical invertibility can be probed using simple geometric diagnostics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了推导关系(DR)和推导能力(DC)的概念，用于评估LLMs基于输入变化进行相应输出修改的推理能力，并开发了DEVAL评估框架和推导提示(DP)方法来提升这种能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在数据上的推理能力是一个重要但尚未充分研究的问题。与人类推理相比，LLMs缺乏基于输入变化进行相应输出修改的抽象规则推理能力。

Method: 提出了推导关系(DR)和推导能力(DC)的形式化定义，构建了DEVAL评估框架来系统评估主流LLMs，并开发了推导提示(DP)方法来提升推导能力。

Result: 评估显示主流LLMs如GPT-4o和Claude3.5具有中等的DR识别能力，但在问题解决场景中应用DR的能力显著下降。DP方法使所有测试LLMs的DC平均提升15.2%，优于常用提示工程技术。

Conclusion: LLMs在基于输入变化进行抽象规则推理方面存在显著不足，但通过推导提示方法可以有效提升这种推导能力。

Abstract: Assessing the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) over data remains an open and pressing research question. Compared with LLMs, human reasoning can derive corresponding modifications to the output based on certain kinds of changes to the input. This reasoning pattern, which relies on abstract rules that govern relationships between changes of data, has not been comprehensively described or evaluated in LLMs. In this paper, we formally define this reasoning pattern as the Derivation Relation (DR) and introduce the concept of Derivation Capability (DC), i.e. applying DR by making the corresponding modification to the output whenever the input takes certain changes. To assess DC, a systematically constructed evaluation framework named DEVAL is proposed and used to evaluate five popular LLMs and one Large Reasoning Model in seven mainstream tasks. The evaluation results show that mainstream LLMs, such as GPT-4o and Claude3.5, exhibit moderate DR recognition capabilities but reveal significant drop-offs on applying DR effectively in problem-solving scenarios. To improve this, we propose a novel prompt engineering approach called Derivation Prompting (DP). It achieves an average improvement of 15.2% in DC for all tested LLMs, outperforming commonly used prompt engineering techniques.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出动态嵌套层次结构作为机器学习模型的进化方向，通过自主调整优化层级、嵌套结构和更新频率，解决现有模型在非平稳环境中的适应性问题，实现真正的终身学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习模型（包括大语言模型）在静态任务中表现出色，但在非平稳环境中由于架构僵化而难以持续适应和学习。模型存在逆行性遗忘问题，无法实现真正的终身学习。

Method: 基于嵌套学习范式，提出动态嵌套层次结构，允许模型在训练或推理过程中自主调整优化层级数量、嵌套结构和更新频率，受神经可塑性启发实现无预定义约束的自进化。

Result: 通过严格的数学公式、收敛性理论证明、表达能力边界分析以及不同机制下的次线性遗憾证明，结合在语言建模、持续学习和长上下文推理中的实证演示，展示了优越性能。

Conclusion: 动态嵌套层次结构为实现自适应、通用智能奠定了基础性进展，解决了模型在非平稳环境中的适应性问题，推动了真正终身学习的发展。

Abstract: Contemporary machine learning models, including large language models, exhibit remarkable capabilities in static tasks yet falter in non-stationary environments due to rigid architectures that hinder continual adaptation and lifelong learning. Building upon the nested learning paradigm, which decomposes models into multi-level optimization problems with fixed update frequencies, this work proposes dynamic nested hierarchies as the next evolutionary step in advancing artificial intelligence and machine learning. Dynamic nested hierarchies empower models to autonomously adjust the number of optimization levels, their nesting structures, and update frequencies during training or inference, inspired by neuroplasticity to enable self-evolution without predefined constraints. This innovation addresses the anterograde amnesia in existing models, facilitating true lifelong learning by dynamically compressing context flows and adapting to distribution shifts. Through rigorous mathematical formulations, theoretical proofs of convergence, expressivity bounds, and sublinear regret in varying regimes, alongside empirical demonstrations of superior performance in language modeling, continual learning, and long-context reasoning, dynamic nested hierarchies establish a foundational advancement toward adaptive, general-purpose intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在多轮工具集成推理任务中面临奖励稀疏、学习信号不足的问题，导致训练停滞。

Method: GTPO算法包含三个关键创新：轮次级奖励分配、基于回报的优势估计、以及利用生成代码自监督信号进行奖励塑造。

Result: 在多样化推理基准测试中，GTPO平均比GRPO提升3.0%的性能。

Conclusion: GTPO能有效提升复杂数学推理任务的训练效果，为现实世界中的复杂推理任务提供了有效的训练方法。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) for multi-turn Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) - where models iteratively reason, generate code, and verify through execution - remains challenging for existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches. Current RL methods, exemplified by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), suffer from coarse-grained, trajectory-level rewards that provide insufficient learning signals for complex multi-turn interactions, leading to training stagnation. To address this issue, we propose Group Turn Policy Optimization (GTPO), a novel RL algorithm specifically designed for training LLMs on multi-turn TIR tasks. GTPO introduces three key innovations: (1) turn-level reward assignment that provides fine-grained feedback for individual turns, (2) return-based advantage estimation where normalized discounted returns are calculated as advantages, and (3) self-supervised reward shaping that exploits self-supervision signals from generated code to densify sparse binary outcome-based rewards. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that GTPO outperforms GRPO by 3.0% on average across diverse reasoning benchmarks, establishing its effectiveness for advancing complex mathematical reasoning in the real world.

TL;DR: FinTRec是一个基于Transformer的金融推荐框架，解决了金融服务中长序列交互、多产品协调等挑战，相比传统树模型在性能和成本方面都有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融服务中的推荐系统面临长序列用户交互、多渠道数据、多产品协调等独特挑战，传统树模型虽然可解释性强但性能有限，需要更先进的架构。

Method: 提出FinTRec框架，采用基于Transformer的架构处理长序列用户交互，支持多产品协调建模，通过产品适配微调实现跨产品信号共享。

Result: 通过历史模拟和在线A/B测试，FinTRec持续优于生产级树模型基线，统一架构减少了训练成本和技术债务，同时提升了所有产品的离线性能。

Conclusion: FinTRec证明了Transformer架构在金融服务推荐中的可行性和有效性，是首个全面解决技术和业务考虑的统一序列推荐模型研究。

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures are widely adopted in sequential recommendation systems, yet their application in Financial Services (FS) presents distinct practical and modeling challenges for real-time recommendation. These include:a) long-range user interactions (implicit and explicit) spanning both digital and physical channels generating temporally heterogeneous context, b) the presence of multiple interrelated products require coordinated models to support varied ad placements and personalized feeds, while balancing competing business goals. We propose FinTRec, a transformer-based framework that addresses these challenges and its operational objectives in FS. While tree-based models have traditionally been preferred in FS due to their explainability and alignment with regulatory requirements, our study demonstrate that FinTRec offers a viable and effective shift toward transformer-based architectures. Through historic simulation and live A/B test correlations, we show FinTRec consistently outperforms the production-grade tree-based baseline. The unified architecture, when fine-tuned for product adaptation, enables cross-product signal sharing, reduces training cost and technical debt, while improving offline performance across all products. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study of unified sequential recommendation modeling in FS that addresses both technical and business considerations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于Transformer引导的深度强化学习方法，用于优化电动垂直起降(eVTOL)飞机的起飞轨迹，以最小化能耗。该方法通过Transformer探索状态空间，显著降低了训练难度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: eVTOL飞机有望缓解城市交通拥堵，但需要开发最小能耗的起飞轨迹。传统最优控制方法受限于问题维度和复杂度，而深度强化学习虽然能处理复杂非线性系统，但训练困难限制了其应用。

Method: 提出Transformer引导的深度强化学习方法，使用Transformer在每个时间步探索真实状态空间，优化eVTOL无人机的起飞轨迹，控制变量包括功率和机翼角度。

Result: Transformer引导的DRL仅需4.57×10^6时间步完成训练，是普通DRL所需时间步(19.79×10^6)的25%。在能耗优化方面达到97.2%的准确率，优于普通DRL的96.3%。

Conclusion: Transformer引导的DRL在训练效率和最优设计验证方面均优于普通DRL，为eVTOL飞机的最优轨迹设计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft offers a promising opportunity to alleviate urban traffic congestion. Thus, developing optimal takeoff trajectories for minimum energy consumption becomes essential for broader eVTOL aircraft applications. Conventional optimal control methods (such as dynamic programming and linear quadratic regulator) provide highly efficient and well-established solutions but are limited by problem dimensionality and complexity. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) emerges as a special type of artificial intelligence tackling complex, nonlinear systems; however, the training difficulty is a key bottleneck that limits DRL applications. To address these challenges, we propose the transformer-guided DRL to alleviate the training difficulty by exploring a realistic state space at each time step using a transformer. The proposed transformer-guided DRL was demonstrated on an optimal takeoff trajectory design of an eVTOL drone for minimal energy consumption while meeting takeoff conditions (i.e., minimum vertical displacement and minimum horizontal velocity) by varying control variables (i.e., power and wing angle to the vertical). Results presented that the transformer-guided DRL agent learned to take off with $4.57\times10^6$ time steps, representing 25% of the $19.79\times10^6$ time steps needed by a vanilla DRL agent. In addition, the transformer-guided DRL achieved 97.2% accuracy on the optimal energy consumption compared against the simulation-based optimal reference while the vanilla DRL achieved 96.3% accuracy. Therefore, the proposed transformer-guided DRL outperformed vanilla DRL in terms of both training efficiency as well as optimal design verification.

TL;DR: 该论文首次系统分析了在低地球轨道卫星星座中部署联邦学习的可行性，提出了"空间化"框架来适应轨道约束，并在768种星座配置下验证了空间化FL算法在100颗卫星规模下的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LEO卫星星座规模扩大到数千颗卫星，下行带宽限制成为瓶颈，需要分布式星上机器学习。联邦学习提供了跨卫星网络协作训练的框架，但需要解决空间特有的约束条件。

Method: 提出了"空间化"框架，将地面FL算法（FedAvg、FedProx、FedBuff）适应轨道约束，创建轨道就绪的FL算法套件。通过768种星座配置的参数扫描进行评估，涵盖集群大小、每集群卫星数和地面站网络的变化。

Conclusion: 研究结果为未来任务设计者提供了可行见解，使分布式星上学习能够实现更自主、弹性和数据驱动的卫星操作。

Abstract: As Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations rapidly expand to hundreds and thousands of spacecraft, the need for distributed on-board machine learning becomes critical to address downlink bandwidth limitations. Federated learning (FL) offers a promising framework to conduct collaborative model training across satellite networks. Realizing its benefits in space naturally requires addressing space-specific constraints, from intermittent connectivity to dynamics imposed by orbital motion. This work presents the first systematic feasibility analysis of adapting off-the-shelf FL algorithms for satellite constellation deployment. We introduce a comprehensive "space-ification" framework that adapts terrestrial algorithms (FedAvg, FedProx, FedBuff) to operate under orbital constraints, producing an orbital-ready suite of FL algorithms. We then evaluate these space-ified methods through extensive parameter sweeps across 768 constellation configurations that vary cluster sizes (1-10), satellites per cluster (1-10), and ground station networks (1-13). Our analysis demonstrates that space-adapted FL algorithms efficiently scale to constellations of up to 100 satellites, achieving performance close to the centralized ideal. Multi-month training cycles can be reduced to days, corresponding to a 9x speedup through orbital scheduling and local coordination within satellite clusters. These results provide actionable insights for future mission designers, enabling distributed on-board learning for more autonomous, resilient, and data-driven satellite operations.

TL;DR: 提出了LIT框架，通过强制LLMs使用外部可靠工具来解决不可靠推理问题，提高解决方案的可信度和可调试性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs推理过程不透明，在高风险领域不可靠且难以排查问题，即使有更好的选择也可能选择不可靠方案

Method: 基于现有LLMs的工具调用能力构建框架，让模型选择最可靠且易于调试的解决方案路径，可能涉及多个顺序工具调用

Result: LLMs在保持任务性能的同时，能够实现更可靠和明智的问题解决

Conclusion: LIT框架能够有效提升LLMs的可靠性和可调试性，适用于需要高可信度的应用场景

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across various domains. The ability to call external tools further expands their capability to handle real-world tasks. However, LLMs often follow an opaque reasoning process, which limits their usefulness in high-stakes domains where solutions need to be trustworthy to end users. LLMs can choose solutions that are unreliable and difficult to troubleshoot, even if better options are available. We address this issue by forcing LLMs to use external -- more reliable -- tools to solve problems when possible. We present a framework built on the tool-calling capabilities of existing LLMs to enable them to select the most reliable and easy-to-troubleshoot solution path, which may involve multiple sequential tool calls. We refer to this framework as LIT (LLMs with Inspectable Tools). In order to support LIT, we introduce a new and challenging benchmark dataset of 1,300 questions and a customizable set of reliability cost functions associated with a collection of specialized tools. These cost functions summarize how reliable each tool is and how easy it is to troubleshoot. For instance, a calculator is reliable across domains, whereas a linear prediction model is not reliable if there is distribution shift, but it is easy to troubleshoot. A tool that constructs a random forest is neither reliable nor easy to troubleshoot. These tools interact with the Harvard USPTO Patent Dataset and a new dataset of NeurIPS 2023 papers to solve mathematical, coding, and modeling problems of varying difficulty levels. We demonstrate that LLMs can achieve more reliable and informed problem-solving while maintaining task performance using our framework.

TL;DR: 提出结构化对比学习(SCL)框架，将潜在空间划分为不变特征、变异特征和自由特征三组，解决神经网络对语义无关变换的脆弱性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络对语义无关变换（如ECG相位偏移、IMU传感器旋转）表现出严重脆弱性，导致性能急剧下降，根源在于"放任"表示学习缺乏约束。

Method: SCL框架将潜在空间划分为：不变特征（在给定变换下保持恒定）、变异特征（通过新型变异机制主动区分变换）和自由特征（保持任务灵活性），无需架构修改即可集成到现有训练流程。

Result: 在ECG相位不变性和IMU旋转鲁棒性实验中表现优异：ECG相似度从0.25提升至0.91，WISDM活动识别准确率达86.65%且旋转一致性达95.38%，显著优于传统数据增强方法。

Conclusion: 本研究实现了从反应式数据增强到主动式结构学习的范式转变，为神经网络提供了可解释的潜在表示。

Abstract: Neural networks exhibit severe brittleness to semantically irrelevant transformations. A mere 75ms electrocardiogram (ECG) phase shift degrades latent cosine similarity from 1.0 to 0.2, while sensor rotations collapse activity recognition performance with inertial measurement units (IMUs). We identify the root cause as "laissez-faire" representation learning, where latent spaces evolve unconstrained provided task performance is satisfied. We propose Structured Contrastive Learning (SCL), a framework that partitions latent space representations into three semantic groups: invariant features that remain consistent under given transformations (e.g., phase shifts or rotations), variant features that actively differentiate transformations via a novel variant mechanism, and free features that preserve task flexibility. This creates controllable push-pull dynamics where different latent dimensions serve distinct, interpretable purposes. The variant mechanism enhances contrastive learning by encouraging variant features to differentiate within positive pairs, enabling simultaneous robustness and interpretability. Our approach requires no architectural modifications and integrates seamlessly into existing training pipelines. Experiments on ECG phase invariance and IMU rotation robustness demonstrate superior performance: ECG similarity improves from 0.25 to 0.91 under phase shifts, while WISDM activity recognition achieves 86.65% accuracy with 95.38% rotation consistency, consistently outperforming traditional data augmentation. This work represents a paradigm shift from reactive data augmentation to proactive structural learning, enabling interpretable latent representations in neural networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度图学习方法在阿尔茨海默病分类中存在混杂因素问题，将人口统计学和遗传因素与疾病特异性特征混淆，需要因果推断方法来识别真正的因果影响。

Method: 将每个受试者的MRI表示为结构连接组，节点表示皮层和皮层下区域，边编码解剖连接性。集成基于do-calculus的后门调整，模拟对单个区域的干预来估计对疾病概率的平均因果效应。

Result: 在ADNI队列的484名受试者中，Causal-GCN实现了与基线GNN相当的性能，同时提供了可解释的因果效应排名，突出了后部、扣带回和岛叶枢纽，与已建立的AD神经病理学一致。

Conclusion: Causal-GCN框架能够识别对阿尔茨海默病进展具有因果影响的大脑区域，为理解疾病机制提供了可解释的因果洞见。

Abstract: Deep graph learning has advanced Alzheimer's (AD) disease classification from MRI, but most models remain correlational, confounding demographic and genetic factors with disease specific features. We present Causal-GCN, an interventional graph convolutional framework that integrates do-calculus-based back-door adjustment to identify brain regions exerting stable causal influence on AD progression. Each subject's MRI is represented as a structural connectome where nodes denote cortical and subcortical regions and edges encode anatomical connectivity. Confounders such as age, sec, and APOE4 genotype are summarized via principal components and included in the causal adjustment set. After training, interventions on individual regions are simulated by serving their incoming edges and altering node features to estimate average causal effects on disease probability. Applied to 484 subjects from the ADNI cohort, Causal-GCN achieves performance comparable to baseline GNNs while providing interpretable causal effect rankings that highlight posterior, cingulate, and insular hubs consistent with established AD neuropathology.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统比较了四种用于医院出院总结自动诊断编码的隐私保护训练方法，发现在中等隐私预算下，基于DP训练教师模型的知识蒸馏方法表现最佳，能恢复63%的非私有性能同时保持强隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在临床文本训练中可能泄露敏感患者信息，但差分隐私方法通常会严重降低诊断准确性，需要找到有效的隐私保护策略来平衡隐私与临床实用性。

Method: 使用相同的10亿参数模型和匹配的隐私预算，系统比较了四种训练流程：直接DP-SGD、DP合成数据训练、知识蒸馏从DP训练教师模型，以及预测ICD-9代码。

Result: 在中等和宽松隐私预算（ε=4,6）下，知识蒸馏方法优于直接DP-SGD和DP合成数据训练，能恢复高达63%的非私有性能，同时保持强经验隐私（成员推断AUC≈0.5）。

Conclusion: 不同架构在隐私-效用权衡上存在显著差异，知识蒸馏被确定为实现隐私保护临床NLP的最实用途径。

Abstract: Large language models trained on clinical text risk exposing sensitive patient information, yet differential privacy (DP) methods often severely degrade the diagnostic accuracy needed for deployment. Despite rapid progress in DP optimisation and text generation, it remains unclear which privacy-preserving strategy actually works best for clinical language tasks. We present the first systematic head-to-head comparison of four training pipelines for automated diagnostic coding from hospital discharge summaries. All pipelines use identical 1B-parameter models and matched privacy budgets to predict ICD-9 codes. At moderate and relaxed privacy budgets ($\varepsilon \in \{4, 6\}$), knowledge distillation from DP-trained teachers outperforms both direct DP-SGD and DP-synthetic data training, recovering up to 63\% of the non-private performance whilst maintaining strong empirical privacy (membership-inference AUC $\approx$ 0.5). These findings expose large differences in the privacy-utility trade-off across architectures and identify knowledge distillation as the most practical route to privacy-preserving clinical NLP.

Motivation: 解决传统方法将每个训练实例孤立处理的问题，通过构建关系记忆来统一实例检索、原型推理和图标签传播，在保持高效推理的同时提供可信解释。

Method: 将嵌入空间总结为原型节点，标注可靠性指标，并通过编码几何和上下文关系的边连接这些节点，形成一个支持归纳推理的图结构模型。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集（包括乳腺癌组织病理学IDC）上的实验表明，GM在准确率上与kNN和标签传播方法相当，但具有更好的校准性、更平滑的决策边界，且样本数量少一个数量级。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模可靠性和关系结构，GM为非参数学习中局部证据与全局一致性之间提供了原则性的桥梁。

Abstract: We introduce Graph Memory (GM), a structured non-parametric framework that augments embedding-based inference with a compact, relational memory over region-level prototypes. Rather than treating each training instance in isolation, GM summarizes the embedding space into prototype nodes annotated with reliability indicators and connected by edges that encode geometric and contextual relations. This design unifies instance retrieval, prototype-based reasoning, and graph-based label propagation within a single inductive model that supports both efficient inference and faithful explanation. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets including breast histopathology (IDC) show that GM achieves accuracy competitive with $k$NN and Label Spreading while offering substantially better calibration and smoother decision boundaries, all with an order of magnitude fewer samples. By explicitly modeling reliability and relational structure, GM provides a principled bridge between local evidence and global consistency in non-parametric learning.

*Jeffrey Jiang,Kevin Hong,Emily Kuczynski,Gregory Pottie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 开发强化学习智能辅导系统，结合学生个体状态学习和群体信息，通过探测性干预在个性化教学与信息收集之间找到平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ITS依赖历史学生数据，但每个新学生都是独特的，且学习过程部分可观测，需要动态环境来模拟真实课堂的师生互动。

Method: 构建动态时间序列环境模拟课堂，设计探测性干预机制，开发结合个体状态学习和群体信息的RL ITS，并与基于规则的启发式方法比较。

Result: RL算法与启发式方法结果相似但解决方案不同；探测性干预能显著提升隐藏信息场景下的性能；策略对变化的学生群体分布具有灵活性，但RL在困难班级中表现较差。

Conclusion: 探测性干预能有效降低学生状态估计难度，课程结构（如包含测验和期中考试）比仅期末考试能提供更多信息，从而获得更好的教学效果。

Abstract: While intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) can use information from past students to personalize instruction, each new student is unique. Moreover, the education problem is inherently difficult because the learning process is only partially observable. We therefore develop a dynamic, time-series environment to simulate a classroom setting, with student-teacher interventions - including tutoring sessions, lectures, and exams. In particular, we design the simulated environment to allow for varying levels of probing interventions that can gather more information. Then, we develop reinforcement learning ITSs that combine learning the individual state of students while pulling from population information through the use of probing interventions. These interventions can reduce the difficulty of student estimation, but also introduce a cost-benefit decision to find a balance between probing enough to get accurate estimates and probing so often that it becomes disruptive to the student. We compare the efficacy of standard RL algorithms with several greedy rules-based heuristic approaches to find that they provide different solutions, but with similar results. We also highlight the difficulty of the problem with increasing levels of hidden information, and the boost that we get if we allow for probing interventions. We show the flexibility of both heuristic and RL policies with regards to changing student population distributions, finding that both are flexible, but RL policies struggle to help harder classes. Finally, we test different course structures with non-probing policies and we find that our policies are able to boost the performance of quiz and midterm structures more than we can in a finals-only structure, highlighting the benefit of having additional information.

TL;DR: 使用电子健康记录预测COVID-19患者住院时长，通过过采样处理数据不平衡问题，采用人工神经网络和贝叶斯优化进行建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COVID-19症状严重程度差异大，高风险患者住院时间长甚至死亡，需要准确预测疾病严重程度以优化医疗资源分配。

Method: 使用电子健康记录数据，以住院时长为严重程度指标；采用过采样技术处理数据不平衡问题；使用人工神经网络模型，通过贝叶斯优化调整超参数。

Result: 选择F1分数最高的模型进行评估和讨论。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效预测COVID-19患者的疾病严重程度，为医疗决策提供支持。

Abstract: COVID-19 is a respiratory disease that caused a global pandemic in 2019. It is highly infectious and has the following symptoms: fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, the new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea. These symptoms vary in severity; some people with many risk factors have been known to have lengthy hospital stays or die from the disease. In this paper, we analyze patients' electronic health records (EHR) to predict the severity of their COVID-19 infection using the length of stay (LOS) as our measurement of severity. This is an imbalanced classification problem, as many people have a shorter LOS rather than a longer one. To combat this problem, we synthetically create alternate oversampled training data sets. Once we have this oversampled data, we run it through an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which during training has its hyperparameters tuned using Bayesian optimization. We select the model with the best F1 score and then evaluate it and discuss it.

*Yun Kwan Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合局部和全局信息提取与注意力融合的框架，用于心律失常检测和分类，在MITDB和AFDB数据库上取得了优于基准模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于心律失常的持续时间变化很大，且发作时间不固定，现有的临床决策支持系统难以有效处理这种变化性，需要开发能够同时捕获局部和全局信息的方法。

Method: 框架包含两部分：(i) 局部和全局特征提取；(ii) 基于注意力的局部-全局信息融合，能够在受限输入长度内进行心律失常检测和分类。

Result: 在MITDB上获得96.45%的持续时间F1分数、82.05%的发作F1分数和96.31%的Dice分数；在AFDB上获得97.57%、98.31%和97.45%的相应分数，均优于基准模型。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效捕获局部和全局信息及动态变化，无显著信息损失，可更准确地检测心律失常并精确定位发作时间，有助于制定更精确的治疗方案。

Abstract: Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) have been widely utilized to support the decisions made by cardiologists when detecting and classifying arrhythmia from electrocardiograms. However, forming a CDSS for the arrhythmia classification task is challenging due to the varying lengths of arrhythmias. Although the onset time of arrhythmia varies, previously developed methods have not considered such conditions. Thus, we propose a framework that consists of (i) local and global extraction and (ii) local-global information fusion with attention to enable arrhythmia detection and classification within a constrained input length. The framework's performance was evaluated in terms of 10-class and 4-class arrhythmia detection, focusing on identifying the onset and ending point of arrhythmia episodes and their duration using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database (MITDB) and the MIT-BIH atrial fibrillation database (AFDB). Duration, episode, and Dice score performances resulted in overall F1-scores of 96.45%, 82.05%, and 96.31% on the MITDB and 97.57%, 98.31%, and 97.45% on the AFDB, respectively. The results demonstrated statistically superior performance compared to those of the benchmark models. To assess the generalization capability of the proposed method, an MITDB-trained model and MIT-BIH malignant ventricular arrhythmia database-trained model were tested AFDB and MITDB, respectively. Superior performance was attained compared with that of a state-of-the-art model. The proposed method effectively captures both local and global information and dynamics without significant information loss. Consequently, arrhythmias can be detected with greater accuracy, and their occurrence times can be precisely determined, enabling the clinical field to develop more accurate treatment plans based on the proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结直肠癌具有高度异质性，传统TNM分期系统无法满足个性化医疗需求，需要开发更准确的预后预测模型。

Method: 使用多实例学习模型TDAM-CRC分析病理全切片图像，在TCGA队列训练并在外部队列验证，整合多组学数据提高可解释性。

Result: TDAM-CRC在两个队列中均实现稳健的风险分层，预测性能显著优于传统分期系统和现有模型，识别MRPL37作为独立预后标志物。

Conclusion: TDAM-CRC为结直肠癌提供了改进的风险分层工具，揭示了新的分子靶点，并促进了个性化临床决策。

Abstract: Precise prognostic stratification of colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a major clinical challenge due to its high heterogeneity. The conventional TNM staging system is inadequate for personalized medicine. We aimed to develop and validate a novel multiple instance learning model TDAM-CRC using histopathological whole-slide images for accurate prognostic prediction and to uncover its underlying molecular mechanisms. We trained the model on the TCGA discovery cohort (n=581), validated it in an independent external cohort (n=1031), and further we integrated multi-omics data to improve model interpretability and identify novel prognostic biomarkers. The results demonstrated that the TDAM-CRC achieved robust risk stratification in both cohorts. Its predictive performance significantly outperformed the conventional clinical staging system and multiple state-of-the-art models. The TDAM-CRC risk score was confirmed as an independent prognostic factor in multivariable analysis. Multi-omics analysis revealed that the high-risk subtype is closely associated with metabolic reprogramming and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Through interaction network analysis, we identified and validated Mitochondrial Ribosomal Protein L37 (MRPL37) as a key hub gene linking deep pathomic features to clinical prognosis. We found that high expression of MRPL37, driven by promoter hypomethylation, serves as an independent biomarker of favorable prognosis. Finally, we constructed a nomogram incorporating the TDAM-CRC risk score and clinical factors to provide a precise and interpretable clinical decision-making tool for CRC patients. Our AI-driven pathological model TDAM-CRC provides a robust tool for improved CRC risk stratification, reveals new molecular targets, and facilitates personalized clinical decision-making.

Result: 在MSL、SMAP和SWaT数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: Fourier-KAN-Mamba混合架构有效解决了时间序列异常检测中的复杂模式捕捉问题，具有优越性能。

Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection plays a critical role in numerous real-world applications, including industrial monitoring and fault diagnosis. Recently, Mamba-based state-space models have shown remarkable efficiency in long-sequence modeling. However, directly applying Mamba to anomaly detection tasks still faces challenges in capturing complex temporal patterns and nonlinear dynamics. In this paper, we propose Fourier-KAN-Mamba, a novel hybrid architecture that integrates Fourier layer, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), and Mamba selective state-space model. The Fourier layer extracts multi-scale frequency features, KAN enhances nonlinear representation capability, and a temporal gating control mechanism further improves the model's ability to distinguish normal and anomalous patterns. Extensive experiments on MSL, SMAP, and SWaT datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Validated on three RF passive components, the framework achieves accurate modeling while using only 2.86% EM simulation time compared to traditional ML-based flow, achieving a 35 times speedup.

Motivation: 大型语言模型通过强化学习提升了推理能力，但仍难以一致地验证自身推理轨迹，需要增强其自我验证能力并探究这种能力是否能进一步改善推理性能

Method: GRPO-Verif算法，在统一损失函数中联合优化解决方案生成和自我验证，通过可调超参数控制验证信号的权重

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have been significantly improved through reinforcement learning (RL). Nevertheless, LLMs still struggle to consistently verify their own reasoning traces. This raises the research question of how to enhance the self-verification ability of LLMs and whether such an ability can further improve reasoning performance. In this work, we propose GRPO-Verif, an algorithm that jointly optimizes solution generation and self-verification within a unified loss function, with an adjustable hyperparameter controlling the weight of the verification signal. Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances self-verification capability while maintaining comparable performance in reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出一种不确定性感知的主动学习框架，通过联合利用模型不确定性和跨模态一致性来增强对标签噪声的鲁棒性，用于EEG情感识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号易受伪影和个体差异影响，情感标签通常来自主观且不一致的报告，使得稳健的情感解码特别困难。需要一种能够处理标签噪声的数据高效方法。

Method: 使用跨模态对齐评估不确定性来源（认知模糊或传感器噪声），将EEG和面部特征嵌入共享潜在空间，通过主动学习选择性地查询噪声样本获取反馈。

Result: 在ASCERTAIN数据集上的实验验证了该方法的效率和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为脑机接口系统中的EEG情感解码提供了一种数据高效且噪声容忍的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models perform best with abundant, high-quality labels, yet such conditions are rarely achievable in EEG-based emotion recognition. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are easily corrupted by artifacts and individual variability, while emotional labels often stem from subjective and inconsistent reports-making robust affective decoding particularly difficult. We propose an uncertainty-aware active learning framework that enhances robustness to label noise by jointly leveraging model uncertainty and cross-modal consistency. Instead of relying solely on EEG-based uncertainty estimates, the method evaluates cross-modal alignment to determine whether uncertainty originates from cognitive ambiguity or sensor noise. A representation alignment module embeds EEG and face features into a shared latent space, enforcing semantic coherence between modalities. Residual discrepancies are treated as noise-induced inconsistencies, and these samples are selectively queried for oracle feedback during active learning. This feedback-driven process guides the network toward reliable, informative samples and reduces the impact of noisy labels. Experiments on the ASCERTAIN dataset examine the efficiency and robustness of ours, highlighting its potential as a data-efficient and noise-tolerant approach for EEG-based affective decoding in brain-computer interface systems.

Motivation: 研究复数变分自编码器的几何结构，探索复数潜在空间中的Kähler几何特性，以改进潜在空间表示的质量和采样效率。

Method: 采用复数VAE架构，在复数高斯正则化下推导Fisher信息度量，提出Kähler势函数导数方法，通过复数高斯混合模型计算度量，避免大规模自动微分计算。

Conclusion: 复数VAE确实展现Kähler几何结构，提出的Kähler势函数方法有效且高效，能够改善潜在空间表示质量，为复数深度学习模型提供了几何理论基础。

Abstract: It has been discovered that latent-Euclidean variational autoencoders (VAEs) admit, in various capacities, Riemannian structure. We adapt these arguments but for complex VAEs with a complex latent stage. We show that complex VAEs reveal to some level Kähler geometric structure. Our methods will be tailored for decoder geometry. We derive the Fisher information metric in the complex case under a latent complex Gaussian regularization with trivial relation matrix. It is well known from statistical information theory that the Fisher information coincides with the Hessian of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. Thus, the metric Kähler potential relation is exactly achieved under relative entropy. We propose a Kähler potential derivative of complex Gaussian mixtures that has rough equivalence to the Fisher information metric while still being faithful to the underlying Kähler geometry. Computation of the metric via this potential is efficient, and through our potential, valid as a plurisubharmonic (PSH) function, large scale computational burden of automatic differentiation is displaced to small scale. We show that we can regularize the latent space with decoder geometry, and that we can sample in accordance with a weighted complex volume element. We demonstrate these strategies, at the exchange of sample variation, yield consistently smoother representations and fewer semantic outliers.

Abstract: In industrial equipment monitoring, fault diagnosis is critical for ensuring system reliability and enabling predictive maintenance. However, the scarcity of fault data, due to the rarity of fault events and the high cost of data annotation, significantly hinders data-driven approaches. Existing time-series generation models, optimized for abundant normal data, struggle to capture fault distributions in few-shot scenarios, producing samples that lack authenticity and diversity due to the large domain gap and high intra-class variability of faults. To address this, we propose a novel few-shot fault time-series generation framework based on diffusion models. Our approach employs a positive-negative difference adapter, leveraging pre-trained normal data distributions to model the discrepancies between normal and fault domains for accurate fault synthesis. Additionally, a diversity loss is introduced to prevent mode collapse, encouraging the generation of diverse fault samples through inter-sample difference regularization. Experimental results demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms traditional methods in authenticity and diversity, achieving state-of-the-art performance on key benchmarks.

Conclusion: 参数化量子电路增强的图神经网络可作为紧凑有效的求解器，在大规模路由和物流优化中具有潜力。

Abstract: The vehicle routing problem (VRP) is a fundamental NP-hard task in intelligent transportation systems with broad applications in logistics and distribution. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has shown promise, yet classical models rely on large multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) that are parameter-heavy and memory-bound. We propose a Quantum Graph Attention Network (Q-GAT) within a DRL framework, where parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) replace conventional MLPs at critical readout stages. The hybrid model maintains the expressive capacity of graph attention encoders while reducing trainable parameters by more than 50%. Using proximal policy optimization (PPO) with greedy and stochastic decoding, experiments on VRP benchmarks show that Q-GAT achieves faster convergence and reduces routing cost by about 5% compared with classical GAT baselines. These results demonstrate the potential of PQC-enhanced GNNs as compact and effective solvers for large-scale routing and logistics optimization.

Motivation: 解决掩码自回归扩散模型推理速度慢的问题，使其更适合强化学习后训练的实际应用。

Method: 提出基于分数的变分目标进行蒸馏，将扩散链压缩为单步自回归生成，并开发MARVAL-RL强化学习框架。

Result: 在ImageNet 256*256上，MARVAL-Huge达到FID 2.00，相比MAR-diffusion加速30倍以上，MARVAL-RL在CLIP和图像奖励分数上持续提升。

Conclusion: MARVAL首次实现了掩码自回归扩散模型的实用蒸馏和强化学习路径，支持快速采样和更好的偏好对齐。

Abstract: Masked auto-regressive diffusion models (MAR) benefit from the expressive modeling ability of diffusion models and the flexibility of masked auto-regressive ordering. However, vanilla MAR suffers from slow inference due to its hierarchical inference mechanism: an outer AR unmasking loop and an inner diffusion denoising chain. Such decoupled structure not only harm the generation efficiency but also hinder the practical use of MAR for reinforcement learning (RL), an increasingly critical paradigm for generative model post-training.To address this fundamental issue, we introduce MARVAL (Masked Auto-regressive Variational Acceleration), a distillation-based framework that compresses the diffusion chain into a single AR generation step while preserving the flexible auto-regressive unmasking order. Such a distillation with MARVAL not only yields substantial inference acceleration but, crucially, makes RL post-training with verifiable rewards practical, resulting in scalable yet human-preferred fast generative models. Our contributions are twofold: (1) a novel score-based variational objective for distilling masked auto-regressive diffusion models into a single generation step without sacrificing sample quality; and (2) an efficient RL framework for masked auto-regressive models via MARVAL-RL. On ImageNet 256*256, MARVAL-Huge achieves an FID of 2.00 with more than 30 times speedup compared with MAR-diffusion, and MARVAL-RL yields consistent improvements in CLIP and image-reward scores on ImageNet datasets with entity names. In conclusion, MARVAL demonstrates the first practical path to distillation and RL of masked auto-regressive diffusion models, enabling fast sampling and better preference alignments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了自适应轨迹策略优化（ATPO），一种轻量级的步骤选择策略，通过动态重新分配梯度更新到高影响力的去噪步骤，显著提升扩散大语言模型的推理准确性和训练稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于轨迹的强化学习方法均匀分配策略梯度到所有去噪步骤，隐含假设所有步骤同等重要。本文挑战这一假设，发现轨迹中存在结构化的"混淆区域"——不确定性和不稳定的瞬时峰值，这些区域强烈预测最终成功或失败。

Method: 提出ATPO方法，使用混合RoEC+CM规则动态识别高影响力步骤，重新分配梯度更新到这些步骤，而不改变RL目标、奖励或计算预算。

Result: ATPO在多个基准测试中显著提升了推理准确性和训练稳定性，证明了利用轨迹动态是推进dLLM RL的关键。

Conclusion: 通过分析轨迹动态并针对性优化高影响力步骤，可以显著提升扩散大语言模型的强化学习性能，这为dLLM RL的发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) are rapidly emerging alongside autoregressive models as a powerful paradigm for complex reasoning, with reinforcement learning increasingly used for downstream alignment. Existing trajectory-based RL methods uniformly allocate policy gradients across denoising steps, implicitly treating all steps as equally important. We challenge this assumption by analyzing trajectories with several step-level metrics: entropy-based uncertainty, Confidence-Margin (CM) uncertainty, and Rate of Entropy Change (RoEC). These reveal structured "zones of confusion": transient spikes in uncertainty and instability that strongly predict final success or failure, while most steps remain stable. We propose Adaptive Trajectory Policy Optimization (ATPO), a lightweight step-selection strategy that dynamically reallocates gradient updates to these high-leverage steps without changing the RL objective, rewards, or compute budget. Using a hybrid RoEC+CM rule, ATPO delivers substantial gains in reasoning accuracy and training stability across benchmarks, showing that exploiting trajectory dynamics is key to advancing dLLM RL.

TL;DR: 提出EntroPIC方法，通过比例-积分控制动态调整正负样本的损失系数来稳定熵值，确保大语言模型在长期训练中保持稳定探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法难以在训练过程中维持适当的熵水平，因为正负样本在不同步骤中对熵的影响方式不同，容易导致模型陷入次优行为。

Method: EntroPIC方法使用比例-积分控制机制，自适应地调整正负样本的损失系数，从而稳定训练过程中的熵值。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能成功维持期望的熵水平，为大语言模型提供稳定且最优的强化学习训练。

Conclusion: EntroPIC方法通过熵稳定化机制，有效解决了大语言模型长期训练中的探索稳定性问题，为大规模LLM训练提供了理论保证和实践有效性。

Abstract: Long-term training of large language models (LLMs) requires maintaining stable exploration to prevent the model from collapsing into sub-optimal behaviors. Entropy is crucial in this context, as it controls exploration and helps avoid premature convergence to sub-optimal solutions. However, existing reinforcement learning methods struggle to maintain an appropriate level of entropy, as the training process involves a mix of positive and negative samples, each affecting entropy in different ways across steps. To address this, we propose Entropy stablilization via Proportional-Integral Control (EntroPIC), a novel method that adaptively adjusts the influence of positive and negative samples by dynamically tuning their loss coefficients. This approach stabilizes entropy throughout training, ensuring efficient exploration and steady progress. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis for both on-policy and off-policy learning settings, demonstrating that EntroPIC is effective at controlling entropy in large-scale LLM training. Experimental results show that our method successfully maintains desired entropy levels, enabling stable and optimal RL training for LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对全球能源转型和可再生能源快速发展背景下，电热联合系统在新能源接入和多重不确定性下的调度优化挑战。

Method: 采用改进的双延迟深度确定性策略梯度(PVTD3)算法，通过引入电网购电变化惩罚项实现系统优化。

Result: 在10%、20%、30%可再生能源渗透率场景下，PVTD3算法相比传统TD3算法分别降低综合成本6.93%、12.68%、13.59%，减少电网购电平均波动幅度12.8%，改善储能管理效果。

Conclusion: PVTD3算法在经济性、电网稳定性和储能设备可持续调度方面均表现出优越性能。

Abstract: With the global energy transition and rapid development of renewable energy, the scheduling optimization challenge for combined power-heat systems under new energy integration and multiple uncertainties has become increasingly prominent. Addressing this challenge, this study proposes an intelligent scheduling method based on the improved Dual-Delay Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (PVTD3) algorithm. System optimization is achieved by introducing a penalty term for grid power purchase variations. Simulation results demonstrate that under three typical scenarios (10%, 20%, and 30% renewable penetration), the PVTD3 algorithm reduces the system's comprehensive cost by 6.93%, 12.68%, and 13.59% respectively compared to the traditional TD3 algorithm. Concurrently, it reduces the average fluctuation amplitude of grid power purchases by 12.8%. Regarding energy storage management, the PVTD3 algorithm reduces the end-time state values of low-temperature thermal storage tanks by 7.67-17.67 units while maintaining high-temperature tanks within the 3.59-4.25 safety operating range. Multi-scenario comparative validation demonstrates that the proposed algorithm not only excels in economic efficiency and grid stability but also exhibits superior sustainable scheduling capabilities in energy storage device management.

TL;DR: PLATONT是一个统一的网络断层扫描框架，通过多模态对齐和对比学习在共享潜在空间中建模不同网络指标，提升了跨任务泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网络断层扫描方法通常单独解决问题且依赖有限的任务特定信号，这限制了方法的泛化性和可解释性。

Method: 基于柏拉图表示假设，将不同网络指标建模为共享潜在网络状态的投影，通过多模态对齐和对比学习学习潜在状态，在共享潜在空间中训练多个断层扫描任务。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，PLATONT在链路估计、拓扑推断和流量预测方面始终优于现有方法，在不同网络条件下实现了更高的准确性和更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PLATONT通过构建紧凑且结构化的表示，显著提升了网络断层扫描任务的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Network tomography aims to infer hidden network states, such as link performance, traffic load, and topology, from external observations. Most existing methods solve these problems separately and depend on limited task-specific signals, which limits generalization and interpretability. We present PLATONT, a unified framework that models different network indicators (e.g., delay, loss, bandwidth) as projections of a shared latent network state. Guided by the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, PLATONT learns this latent state through multimodal alignment and contrastive learning. By training multiple tomography tasks within a shared latent space, it builds compact and structured representations that improve cross-task generalization. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that PLATONT consistently outperforms existing methods in link estimation, topology inference, and traffic prediction, achieving higher accuracy and stronger robustness under varying network conditions.

Motivation: GRPO在大型语言模型微调中表现出色，但能否推广到表示学习模型尚不明确。本文旨在探索GRPO类策略在表示模型后训练中的应用潜力。

Method: 提出GRPO-RM方法：建立预定义输出集替代LLM中的token序列采样，生成输出组；设计专门的奖励函数以适应表示模型的特性。

Result: 在多个真实世界数据集上进行广泛实验，验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: GRPO-RM成功将GRPO技术扩展到表示学习领域，为表示模型的优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: The Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning method used to fine-tune large language models (LLMs), has proved its effectiveness in practical applications such as DeepSeek-R1. It raises a question whether GRPO can be generalized to representation learning models. In this paper, we propose Group Relative Policy Optimization for Representation Model (GRPO-RM), and investigate the performance of GRPO-like policy in post-training representation models. Specifically, our method establishes a predefined output set to functionally replace token sequence sampling in LLMs, thereby generating an output group, which is essential for the probability-driven optimization of GRPO. In addition, a specialized reward function is designed to accommodate the properties of representation models. Extensive experiments are conducted on various real-world datasets to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SNAP是一个稀疏测试时适应框架，通过减少适应频率和数据使用来降低计算成本，同时保持准确性，特别适合资源受限的边缘环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时适应方法依赖频繁适应和高计算成本，不适合资源受限的边缘环境。需要开发能够在低频率更新下保持准确性的高效TTA方法。

Method: SNAP包含两个关键组件：(1) CnDRM - 识别并存储少量具有类别和域代表性的样本；(2) IoBMN - 在推理时利用代表性样本动态调整归一化统计量。该方法与五种最先进的TTA算法集成。

Result: SNAP仅使用1%的传入数据流进行适应，在1%到50%的适应率范围内，延迟降低高达93.12%，同时准确率下降保持在3.3%以下。

Conclusion: SNAP展示了在边缘设备上实际应用的强大潜力，特别适合延迟敏感的应用场景。

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) adjusts models using unlabeled test data to handle dynamic distribution shifts. However, existing methods rely on frequent adaptation and high computational cost, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained edge environments. To address this, we propose SNAP, a sparse TTA framework that reduces adaptation frequency and data usage while preserving accuracy. SNAP maintains competitive accuracy even when adapting based on only 1% of the incoming data stream, demonstrating its robustness under infrequent updates. Our method introduces two key components: (i) Class and Domain Representative Memory (CnDRM), which identifies and stores a small set of samples that are representative of both class and domain characteristics to support efficient adaptation with limited data; and (ii) Inference-only Batch-aware Memory Normalization (IoBMN), which dynamically adjusts normalization statistics at inference time by leveraging these representative samples, enabling efficient alignment to shifting target domains. Integrated with five state-of-the-art TTA algorithms, SNAP reduces latency by up to 93.12%, while keeping the accuracy drop below 3.3%, even across adaptation rates ranging from 1% to 50%. This demonstrates its strong potential for practical use on edge devices serving latency-sensitive applications. The source code is available at https://github.com/chahh9808/SNAP.

*Rayen Dhahri,Steffen Urban*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Quant-Trim是一种训练阶段方法，通过渐进式伪量化和反向剪枝，生成硬件中立的量化检查点，减少对特定后端编译器的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘加速器依赖低比特量化，但不同厂商编译器在缩放、裁剪和内核支持方面存在差异，导致相同浮点检查点在不同后端产生不一致的精度，迫使开发者调整参数或重构模型。

Method: 结合渐进式伪量化（使训练与部署的整数网格对齐）和反向剪枝（控制异常值驱动的尺度膨胀同时保持可学习性），无需特定厂商的图修改。

Result: 在多个模型和任务中，缩小了浮点与低比特之间的精度差距，减少了对编译器启发式/校准的依赖，避免了针对每个后端的重新训练。

Conclusion: Quant-Trim提供了一种硬件中立的解决方案，支持多种量化方案，提高了量化模型在不同边缘设备上的一致性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Specialized edge accelerators rely on low-bit quantization, but vendor compilers differ in scaling, clipping, and kernel support, often as black boxes. The same floating-point (FP) checkpoint can therefore yield inconsistent accuracy across backends, forcing practitioners to tweak flags or refactor models to vendor-friendly operator subsets. We introduce Quant-Trim, a training-phase method that produces a hardware-neutral checkpoint robust to backend and precision choices. It combines progressive fake quantization to align training with the deployed integer grid and reverse pruning to tame outlier-driven scale inflation while preserving learnability. Quant-Trim is agnostic to quantization schemes (symmetric/asymmetric,per-tensor/per-channel, INT8/INT4) and requires no vendor-specific graph changes.Across models and tasks, it narrows the FP,low-bit gap, reduces dependence on compiler heuristics/calibration, and avoids per-backend retraining. We report accuracy and edge metrics latency, throughput, energy/inference, and cost under static/dynamic activation scaling and varying operator coverage.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了时间序列基础模型的概念可解释性，分析了不同层编码的概念类型、概念参数的线性可恢复性、表示在模型深度上的演化以及模型处理概念组合的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管时间序列基础模型在经验上取得了成功，但其内部表示基本时间序列概念的机制仍不明确，需要系统性地理解这些模型如何编码和处理时间序列概念。

Method: 使用分层分析、线性可恢复性测试和表示相似性度量等方法，系统地探究了概念在不同层的编码位置、线性可恢复性、表示演化和概念组合处理能力。

Result: 早期层主要捕获局部时域模式，深层编码离散度和变化时间信号，谱和扭曲因子最难线性恢复。在组合场景下，探针性能下降，显示概念间存在干扰。

Conclusion: 虽然原子概念能可靠定位，但概念组合仍是当前TSFMs的关键限制，表明这些模型在表示交互时间现象方面存在不足。

Abstract: Time-series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have recently emerged as a universal paradigm for learning across diverse temporal domains. However, despite their empirical success, the internal mechanisms by which these models represent fundamental time-series concepts remain poorly understood. In this work, we undertake a systematic investigation of concept interpretability in TSFMs. Specifically, we examine: (i) which layers encode which concepts, (ii) whether concept parameters are linearly recoverable, (iii) how representations evolve in terms of concept disentanglement and abstraction across model depth, and (iv) how models process compositions of concepts. We systematically probe these questions using layer-wise analyses, linear recoverability tests, and representation similarity measures, providing a structured account of TSFM semantics. The resulting insights show that early layers mainly capture local, time-domain patterns (e.g., AR(1), level shifts, trends), while deeper layers encode dispersion and change-time signals, with spectral and warping factors remaining the hardest to recover linearly. In compositional settings, however, probe performance degrades, revealing interference between concepts. This highlights that while atomic concepts are reliably localized, composition remains a challenge, underscoring a key limitation in current TSFMs' ability to represent interacting temporal phenomena.

TL;DR: KrawtchoukNet是基于离散Krawtchouk多项式的GNN滤波器，通过固定多项式域N为小常数和可学习形状参数p，解决了传统谱GNN在异质图上的性能崩溃和高阶多项式过平滑问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于多项式滤波器的谱GNN存在两个关键限制：1)在异质图上性能崩溃；2)高阶多项式时出现过平滑。这些问题源于标准滤波器的静态低通特性。

Method: 提出KrawtchoukNet，采用两个关键设计：1)固定多项式域N为小常数，使递推系数固有有界，增强对过平滑的鲁棒性；2)使滤波器形状参数p可学习，滤波器能自适应图数据的谱响应。

Result: 在K=10时达到SOTA结果，对过平滑异常鲁棒；在挑战性异质基准测试（Texas、Cornell）上实现SOTA性能，明显优于GAT和APPNP等标准GNN。

Conclusion: KrawtchoukNet通过有界递推系数和自适应谱响应，为谱GNN在异质图和高阶多项式下的性能崩溃问题提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) based on polynomial filters, such as ChebyNet, suffer from two critical limitations: 1) performance collapse on "heterophilic" graphs and 2) performance collapse at high polynomial degrees (K), known as over-smoothing. Both issues stem from the static, low-pass nature of standard filters. In this work, we propose `KrawtchoukNet`, a GNN filter based on the discrete Krawtchouk polynomials. We demonstrate that `KrawtchoukNet` provides a unified solution to both problems through two key design choices. First, by fixing the polynomial's domain N to a small constant (e.g., N=20), we create the first GNN filter whose recurrence coefficients are \textit{inherently bounded}, making it exceptionally robust to over-smoothing (achieving SOTA results at K=10). Second, by making the filter's shape parameter p learnable, the filter adapts its spectral response to the graph data. We show this adaptive nature allows `KrawtchoukNet` to achieve SOTA performance on challenging heterophilic benchmarks (Texas, Cornell), decisively outperforming standard GNNs like GAT and APPNP.

Motivation: 传统谱图神经网络在异质图上性能差，且在高阶多项式时会出现过平滑问题，现有自适应多项式滤波器在连续域扩展和系数无界稳定性方面存在挑战。

Method: 使用连续拉盖尔多项式构建GNN滤波器，使核心alpha参数可训练，并采用LayerNorm稳定化技术解决无界多项式数值不稳定性问题。

Result: LaguerreNet在异质图基准测试中达到最先进性能，对过平滑具有极强鲁棒性，性能在K=10时达到峰值，比ChebyNet崩溃点高一个数量级。

Conclusion: LaguerreNet通过连续拉盖尔多项式和可训练参数，有效解决了谱GNN在异质图和过平滑方面的关键限制。

Abstract: Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) suffer from two critical limitations: poor performance on "heterophilic" graphs and performance collapse at high polynomial degrees (K), known as over-smoothing. Both issues stem from the static, low-pass nature of standard filters (e.g., ChebyNet). While adaptive polynomial filters, such as the discrete MeixnerNet, have emerged as a potential unified solution, their extension to the continuous domain and stability with unbounded coefficients remain open questions. In this work, we propose `LaguerreNet`, a novel GNN filter based on continuous Laguerre polynomials. `LaguerreNet` learns the filter's spectral shape by making its core alpha parameter trainable, thereby advancing the adaptive polynomial approach. We solve the severe O(k^2) numerical instability of these unbounded polynomials using a `LayerNorm`-based stabilization technique. We demonstrate experimentally that this approach is highly effective: 1) `LaguerreNet` achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging heterophilic benchmarks. 2) It is exceptionally robust to over-smoothing, with performance peaking at K=10, an order of magnitude beyond where ChebyNet collapses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 汽车遥测数据同时存在慢漂移和快尖峰，标准重建方法使用单一潜在过程会混淆不同时间尺度，导致尖峰被平滑或方差膨胀，削弱异常分离能力。

Method: 使用双路径编码器分离慢漂移和快尖峰信号动态，解码器将瞬态偏差与正常操作模式分开表示，专为部署设计，能在不同操作模式下产生稳定的异常分数。

Result: 在汽车遥测数据集和公开SMD基准测试中，明确分离漂移和尖峰动态相比强基线方法（预测、注意力、图和VAE）提高了鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过分离不同时间尺度的信号动态，STREAM-VAE在汽车遥测异常检测中表现出更好的性能和部署稳定性。

Abstract: Automotive telemetry data exhibits slow drifts and fast spikes, often within the same sequence, making reliable anomaly detection challenging. Standard reconstruction-based methods, including sequence variational autoencoders (VAEs), use a single latent process and therefore mix heterogeneous time scales, which can smooth out spikes or inflate variances and weaken anomaly separation.
  In this paper, we present STREAM-VAE, a variational autoencoder for anomaly detection in automotive telemetry time-series data. Our model uses a dual-path encoder to separate slow drift and fast spike signal dynamics, and a decoder that represents transient deviations separately from the normal operating pattern. STREAM-VAE is designed for deployment, producing stable anomaly scores across operating modes for both in-vehicle monitors and backend fleet analytics.
  Experiments on an automotive telemetry dataset and the public SMD benchmark show that explicitly separating drift and spike dynamics improves robustness compared to strong forecasting, attention, graph, and VAE baselines.

Abstract: Ensembling is a powerful technique for improving the accuracy of machine learning models, with methods like stacking achieving strong results in tabular tasks. In time series forecasting, however, ensemble methods remain underutilized, with simple linear combinations still considered state-of-the-art. In this paper, we systematically explore ensembling strategies for time series forecasting. We evaluate 33 ensemble models -- both existing and novel -- across 50 real-world datasets. Our results show that stacking consistently improves accuracy, though no single stacker performs best across all tasks. To address this, we propose a multi-layer stacking framework for time series forecasting, an approach that combines the strengths of different stacker models. We demonstrate that this method consistently provides superior accuracy across diverse forecasting scenarios. Our findings highlight the potential of stacking-based methods to improve AutoML systems for time series forecasting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习预测模型往往忽略下游价值权衡和临床可解释性，需要开发能沟通预测应用权衡的框架。

Method: 开发预测心力衰竭患者1年死亡率的XGB模型，引入临床影响投影(CIP)曲线可视化成本维度，使用4个LLM代理生成患者特定描述。

Result: XGB模型表现最佳(AUROC=0.804)，CIP曲线提供群体级成本概览，LLM生成个体级成本效益分析，临床医生评价良好但需提升技术准确性。

Conclusion: CAP框架利用LLM代理整合机器学习分类结果和成本效益分析，提供更透明可解释的决策支持。

Abstract: Objective: Machine learning (ML) predictive models are often developed without considering downstream value trade-offs and clinical interpretability. This paper introduces a cost-aware prediction (CAP) framework that combines cost-benefit analysis assisted by large language model (LLM) agents to communicate the trade-offs involved in applying ML predictions. Materials and Methods: We developed an ML model predicting 1-year mortality in patients with heart failure (N = 30,021, 22% mortality) to identify those eligible for home care. We then introduced clinical impact projection (CIP) curves to visualize important cost dimensions - quality of life and healthcare provider expenses, further divided into treatment and error costs, to assess the clinical consequences of predictions. Finally, we used four LLM agents to generate patient-specific descriptions. The system was evaluated by clinicians for its decision support value. Results: The eXtreme gradient boosting (XGB) model achieved the best performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.804 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.792-0.816), area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.529 (95% CI 0.502-0.558) and a Brier score of 0.135 (95% CI 0.130-0.140). Discussion: The CIP cost curves provided a population-level overview of cost composition across decision thresholds, whereas LLM-generated cost-benefit analysis at individual patient-levels. The system was well received according to the evaluation by clinicians. However, feedback emphasizes the need to strengthen the technical accuracy for speculative tasks. Conclusion: CAP utilizes LLM agents to integrate ML classifier outcomes and cost-benefit analysis for more transparent and interpretable decision support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习中评估个体特征重要性对于理解模型决策过程至关重要，但现有方法缺乏明确的真实基准进行比较，需要替代的、有理论基础的度量方法。

Method: 生成正负反事实样本集，使用核密度估计建模其分布，基于分布差异度量对特征进行排序，该度量在严格数学框架下满足有效度量的关键性质。

Conclusion: CID方法作为模型分析的有价值工具具有潜力，能够提供更可靠的特征重要性解释。

Abstract: Assessing the importance of individual features in Machine Learning is critical to understand the model's decision-making process. While numerous methods exist, the lack of a definitive ground truth for comparison highlights the need for alternative, well-founded measures. This paper introduces a novel post-hoc local feature importance method called Counterfactual Importance Distribution (CID). We generate two sets of positive and negative counterfactuals, model their distributions using Kernel Density Estimation, and rank features based on a distributional dissimilarity measure. This measure, grounded in a rigorous mathematical framework, satisfies key properties required to function as a valid metric. We showcase the effectiveness of our method by comparing with well-established local feature importance explainers. Our method not only offers complementary perspectives to existing approaches, but also improves performance on faithfulness metrics (both for comprehensiveness and sufficiency), resulting in more faithful explanations of the system. These results highlight its potential as a valuable tool for model analysis.

Abstract: Domain-specific post-training often causes catastrophic forgetting, making foundation models lose their general reasoning ability and limiting their adaptability to dynamic real-world environments. Preserving general capabilities while acquiring downstream domain knowledge is a central challenge for large language and multimodal models. Traditional continual learning methods, such as regularization, replay and architectural isolation, suffer from poor downstream performance, reliance on inaccessible historical data, or additional parameter overhead. While recent parameter-efficient tuning (PET) methods can alleviate forgetting, their effectiveness strongly depends on the choice of parameters and update strategies. In this paper, we introduce PIECE, a Parameter Importance Estimation-based Continual Enhancement method that preserves general ability while efficiently learning domain knowledge without accessing prior training data or increasing model parameters. PIECE selectively updates only 0.1% of core parameters most relevant to new tasks, guided by two importance estimators: PIECE-F based on Fisher Information, and PIECE-S based on a second-order normalization that combines gradient and curvature information. Experiments across three language models and two multimodal models show that PIECE maintains general capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art continual learning performance across diverse downstream tasks. Our results highlight a practical path to scalable, domain-adaptive foundation models without catastrophic forgetting.

TL;DR: EVA-Net是一个可解释的脑年龄异常检测框架，使用稀疏注意力Transformer处理长EEG序列，通过变分信息瓶颈学习鲁棒表示，并利用原型网络学习健康老化流形，在健康人群中达到最先进准确率，并能有效检测MCI和AD患者的异常。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有脑年龄模型在处理不完美的医疗数据（如仅从健康人群学习基线）时存在困难，且标准模型通常是缺乏可解释结构的黑盒，这限制了在疾病检测中的应用。

Method: 提出EVA-Net框架，使用稀疏注意力Transformer建模长EEG序列，采用变分信息瓶颈处理噪声和变异性，通过连续原型网络学习健康老化流形以实现可解释性。

Result: 在1297名健康受试者上训练达到最先进准确率，在27名MCI和AD患者队列中验证，该病理组显示出显著更高的脑年龄差距和原型对齐误差，证实其偏离健康流形。

Conclusion: EVA-Net为使用不完美医疗数据的医疗智能提供了一个可解释的框架，能够有效检测脑部疾病异常。

Abstract: The brain age is a key indicator of brain health. While electroencephalography (EEG) is a practical tool for this task, existing models struggle with the common challenge of imperfect medical data, such as learning a ``normal'' baseline from weakly supervised, healthy-only cohorts. This is a critical anomaly detection task for identifying disease, but standard models are often black boxes lacking an interpretable structure. We propose EVA-Net, a novel framework that recasts brain age as an interpretable anomaly detection problem. EVA-Net uses an efficient, sparsified-attention Transformer to model long EEG sequences. To handle noise and variability in imperfect data, it employs a Variational Information Bottleneck to learn a robust, compressed representation. For interpretability, this representation is aligned to a continuous prototype network that explicitly learns the normative healthy aging manifold. Trained on 1297 healthy subjects, EVA-Net achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. We validated its anomaly detection capabilities on an unseen cohort of 27 MCI and AD patients. This pathological group showed significantly higher brain-age gaps and a novel Prototype Alignment Error, confirming their deviation from the healthy manifold. EVA-Net provides an interpretable framework for healthcare intelligence using imperfect medical data.

Conclusion: 所提出的变分拉格朗日框架为非线性非高斯状态估计提供了统一的方法论，通过不同的后验分解方式产生算法族，具有良好的计算效率和适用性。

Abstract: We present a class of algorithms for state estimation in nonlinear, non-Gaussian state-space models. Our approach is based on a variational Lagrangian formulation that casts Bayesian inference as a sequence of entropic trust-region updates subject to dynamic constraints. This framework gives rise to a family of forward-backward algorithms, whose structure is determined by the chosen factorization of the variational posterior. By focusing on Gauss--Markov approximations, we derive recursive schemes with favorable computational complexity. For general nonlinear, non-Gaussian models we close the recursions using generalized statistical linear regression and Fourier--Hermite moment matching.

Abstract: Despite the architectural similarities between tabular in-context learning (ICL) models and large language models (LLMs), little is known about how individual layers contribute to tabular prediction. In this paper, we investigate how the latent spaces evolve across layers in tabular ICL models, identify potential redundant layers, and compare these dynamics with those observed in LLMs. We analyze TabPFN and TabICL through the "layers as painters" perspective, finding that only subsets of layers share a common representational language, suggesting structural redundancy and offering opportunities for model compression and improved interpretability.

Abstract: This paper introduces a classification method using in-context learning in time-series foundation models (TSFM). We show how data, which was not part of the TSFM training data corpus, can be classified without the need of finetuning the model. Examples are represented in the form of targets (class id) and covariates (data matrix) within the prompt of the model, which enables to classify an unknown covariate data pattern alongside the forecast axis through in-context learning. We apply this method to vibration data for assessing the health state of a bearing within a servo-press motor. The method transforms frequency domain reference signals into pseudo time-series patterns, generates aligned covariate and target signals, and uses the TSFM to predict probabilities how classified data corresponds to predefined labels. Leveraging the scalability of pre-trained models this method demonstrates efficacy across varied operational conditions. This marks significant progress beyond custom narrow AI solutions towards broader, AI-driven maintenance systems.

Conclusion: FairEnergy框架有效解决了联邦学习中的能量效率、公平参与和模型精度之间的权衡问题，为无线边缘系统提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed devices while preserving data privacy. However, balancing energy efficiency and fair participation while ensuring high model accuracy remains challenging in wireless edge systems due to heterogeneous resources, unequal client contributions, and limited communication capacity. To address these challenges, we propose FairEnergy, a fairness-aware energy minimization framework that integrates a contribution score capturing both the magnitude of updates and their compression ratio into the joint optimization of device selection, bandwidth allocation, and compression level. The resulting mixed-integer non-convex problem is solved by relaxing binary selection variables and applying Lagrangian decomposition to handle global bandwidth coupling, followed by per-device subproblem optimization. Experiments on non-IID data show that FairEnergy achieves higher accuracy while reducing energy consumption by up to 79\% compared to baseline strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式神经表示在拟合高分辨率信号时需要优化数百万个坐标，计算成本过高，需要更高效的训练方法。

Method: 利用神经正切核(NTK)对示例进行评分，通过NTK增强的损失梯度范数来选择坐标，同时考虑拟合误差和异构杠杆效应。

Result: 实验表明NINT显著减少了训练时间，同时保持或提高了表示质量，在基于采样的加速策略中达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: NINT通过NTK引导的坐标选择有效加速了隐式神经表示的训练，为高分辨率信号建模提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) parameterize continuous signals via multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), enabling compact, resolution-independent modeling for tasks like image, audio, and 3D reconstruction. However, fitting high-resolution signals demands optimizing over millions of coordinates, incurring prohibitive computational costs. To address it, we propose NTK-Guided Implicit Neural Teaching (NINT), which accelerates training by dynamically selecting coordinates that maximize global functional updates. Leveraging the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), NINT scores examples by the norm of their NTK-augmented loss gradients, capturing both fitting errors and heterogeneous leverage (self-influence and cross-coordinate coupling). This dual consideration enables faster convergence compared to existing methods. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that NINT significantly reduces training time by nearly half while maintaining or improving representation quality, establishing state-of-the-art acceleration among recent sampling-based strategies.

TL;DR: 本文研究了按需采样中样本复杂度和轮数复杂度之间的权衡关系，在可实现的MDL中证明了最优样本复杂度约为dk^{Θ(1/r)}/ε，在不可知情况下提出了在Õ(√k)轮内达到近最优样本复杂度Õ((d+k)/ε²)的算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多分布学习(MDL)中样本复杂度和轮数复杂度之间的基本权衡关系，特别是在按需采样设置下，学习算法在有限轮数内自适应地从k个分布中采样。

Method: 提出了一个新的框架OODS(通过按需采样进行优化)，抽象化样本自适应权衡并捕获大多数现有MDL算法。在可实现的MDL中分析最优样本复杂度，在不可知情况下设计高效的轮数算法。

Result: 在可实现的MDL中，r轮算法的最优样本复杂度约为dk^{Θ(1/r)}/ε；在不可知MDL中，提出了在Õ(√k)轮内达到样本复杂度Õ((d+k)/ε²)的算法；建立了OODS设置中轮数复杂度的紧界。

Conclusion: OODS框架的上界直接产生了不可知MDL的Õ(√k)轮算法，而下界表明要实现亚多项式轮数复杂度需要绕过OODS固有硬度的全新技术。

Abstract: We study the tradeoff between sample complexity and round complexity in on-demand sampling, where the learning algorithm adaptively samples from $k$ distributions over a limited number of rounds. In the realizable setting of Multi-Distribution Learning (MDL), we show that the optimal sample complexity of an $r$-round algorithm scales approximately as $dk^{Θ(1/r)} / ε$. For the general agnostic case, we present an algorithm that achieves near-optimal sample complexity of $\widetilde O((d + k) / ε^2)$ within $\widetilde O(\sqrt{k})$ rounds. Of independent interest, we introduce a new framework, Optimization via On-Demand Sampling (OODS), which abstracts the sample-adaptivity tradeoff and captures most existing MDL algorithms. We establish nearly tight bounds on the round complexity in the OODS setting. The upper bounds directly yield the $\widetilde O(\sqrt{k})$-round algorithm for agnostic MDL, while the lower bounds imply that achieving sub-polynomial round complexity would require fundamentally new techniques that bypass the inherent hardness of OODS.

Conclusion: PCARNN-DCBF通过结构保持方法成功解决了高保真学习与可验证控制之间的权衡问题，为地面车辆运行时地理围栏提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Runtime geofencing for ground vehicles is rapidly emerging as a critical technology for enforcing Operational Design Domains (ODDs). However, existing solutions struggle to reconcile high-fidelity learning with the structural requirements of verifiable control. We address this by introducing PCARNN-DCBF, a novel pipeline integrating a Physics-encoded Control-Affine Residual Neural Network with a preview-based Discrete Control Barrier Function. Unlike generic learned models, PCARNN explicitly preserves the control-affine structure of vehicle dynamics, ensuring the linearity required for reliable optimization. This enables the DCBF to enforce polygonal keep-in constraints via a real-time Quadratic Program (QP) that handles high relative degree and mitigates actuator saturation. Experiments in CARLA across electric and combustion platforms demonstrate that this structure-preserving approach significantly outperforms analytical and unstructured neural baselines.

Abstract: Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are a conventional way to describe the observed dynamics of physical systems. Scientists typically hypothesize about dynamical behavior, propose a mathematical model, and compare its predictions to data. However, modern computing and algorithmic advances now enable purely data-driven learning of governing dynamics directly from observations. In data-driven settings, one learns the ODE's right-hand side (RHS). Dense measurements are often assumed, yet high temporal resolution is typically both cumbersome and expensive. Consequently, one usually has only sparsely sampled data. In this work we introduce ChaosODE (CODE), a Polynomial Chaos ODE Expansion in which we use an arbitrary Polynomial Chaos Expansion (aPCE) for the ODE's right-hand side, resulting in a global orthonormal polynomial representation of dynamics. We evaluate the performance of CODE in several experiments on the Lotka-Volterra system, across varying noise levels, initial conditions, and predictions far into the future, even on previously unseen initial conditions. CODE exhibits remarkable extrapolation capabilities even when evaluated under novel initial conditions and shows advantages compared to well-examined methods using neural networks (NeuralODE) or kernel approximators (KernelODE) as the RHS representer. We observe that the high flexibility of NeuralODE and KernelODE degrades extrapolation capabilities under scarce data and measurement noise. Finally, we provide practical guidelines for robust optimization of dynamics-learning problems and illustrate them in the accompanying code.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) is a branch of machine learning that aims to enable agents to adapt and generalise previously learned abilities so that these can be reapplied to new tasks or environments. This is particularly useful in multi-task settings or in non-stationary environments, where the dynamics can change over time. This is particularly relevant in cyber-physical systems such as autonomous driving. However, despite recent advances in CL, successfully applying it to reinforcement learning (RL) is still an open problem.
  This paper highlights open challenges in continual RL (CRL) based on experiments in an autonomous driving environment. In this environment, the agent must learn to successfully park in four different scenarios corresponding to parking spaces oriented at varying angles. The agent is successively trained in these four scenarios one after another, representing a CL environment, using Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO). These experiments exposed a number of open challenges in CRL: finding suitable abstractions of the environment, oversensitivity to hyperparameters, catastrophic forgetting, and efficient use of neural network capacity.
  Based on these identified challenges, we present open research questions that are important to be addressed for creating robust CRL systems. In addition, the identified challenges call into question the suitability of neural networks for CL. We also identify the need for interdisciplinary research, in particular between computer science and neuroscience.

Abstract: Enabling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to "think before acting" via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is a promising path to overcoming the data-hungry nature of end-to-end robot policies. However, progress is stalled by a fundamental conflict: existing models use a single autoregressive decoder for both sequential CoT reasoning and high-dimensional, parallelizable robot actions. This architectural mismatch degrades motor control and fails to forge a strong causal link between thought and action. We introduce DeepThinkVLA, which resolves this conflict through a tightly integrated architecture and training strategy. Architecturally, our hybrid-attention decoder generates sequential CoT with causal attention and then switches to bidirectional attention for fast, parallel decoding of action vectors. This design is complemented by a two-stage training pipeline: we first use Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to teach the model foundational reasoning, then apply Reinforcement Learning (RL) with task-success rewards to causally align the full reasoning-action sequence with desired outcomes. This synergy leads to state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 97.0% success rate on the LIBERO benchmark. Our ablations confirm the design's effectiveness: the hybrid architecture alone outperforms standard decoders by 15.5%, and the final RL stage provides a crucial 2% boost to secure top performance.

Abstract: Foundation models have transformed machine learning for language and vision, but achieving comparable impact in physical simulation remains a challenge. Data heterogeneity and unstable long-term dynamics inhibit learning from sufficiently diverse dynamics, while varying resolutions and dimensionalities challenge efficient training on modern hardware. Through empirical and theoretical analysis, we incorporate new approaches to mitigate these obstacles, including a harmonic-analysis-based stabilization method, load-balanced distributed 2D and 3D training strategies, and compute-adaptive tokenization. Using these tools, we develop Walrus, a transformer-based foundation model developed primarily for fluid-like continuum dynamics. Walrus is pretrained on nineteen diverse scenarios spanning astrophysics, geoscience, rheology, plasma physics, acoustics, and classical fluids. Experiments show that Walrus outperforms prior foundation models on both short and long term prediction horizons on downstream tasks and across the breadth of pretraining data, while ablation studies confirm the value of our contributions to forecast stability, training throughput, and transfer performance over conventional approaches. Code and weights are released for community use.

Abstract: Strong reasoning capabilities can now be achieved by large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without any supervised fine-tuning. Although post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT) are well studied in the context of fine-tuning, how quantization impacts RL in large reasoning models (LRMs) remains an open question. To answer this question, we conducted systematic experiments and discovered a significant gap in reasoning performance on mathematical benchmarks between post-RL quantized models and their quantization-aware RL optimized counterparts. Our findings suggest that quantization-aware RL training negatively impacted the learning process, whereas PTQ and QLoRA led to greater performance.
